<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with humorous banter about the physical side effects of reading Maxim Magazine, including invented ailments like "butt-hickey" and "ring around the butt."  Mark Golan, editor-in-chief of Maxim, was the in-studio guest.  A major topic was a prank targeting the Today Show, offering a reward for a woman flashing her breasts on air, and the show's escalating security response.  A contest was announced to guess the date of President Clinton's resignation or impeachment, with a Washington D.C. trip as a prize. Golan discussed his time at Cosmopolitan and shared anecdotes.

The conversation then shifted to the Angola Prison Rodeo (a purported event where inmates play poker while a bull charges them), Maxim's initiative to receive letters from inmates, and a critique of a Ted Koppel prison documentary.  The discussion included prison-made weapons sent to Maxim.  Opie's aunt Fran and her friend Cherry (who recently had breast implants) joined the show, resulting in crude and sexually explicit comments about Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton's affair, including discussions about the number of photos of Lewinsky with her mouth open in newspapers, and the sexual preferences of past presidents.

The show revisited Maxim Magazine, focusing on their "world's deadliest things" article (with a trivia question about the deadliest animal in America â€“ deer) and other features like a life-size model corpse and the "Office Game."  They also reminisced about 1970s television shows like *Happy Days*, *Different Strokes*, and *CHiPs*, using crude and offensive language.

A significant portion of the show revolved around the "Alive or Dead" game, where Opie and Anthony, along with Golan, called celebrities to see if they were still alive.  They recounted past calls, including a hilarious call to a very much alive Buddy Epson, and the awkwardness of explaining the game. Listeners were encouraged to submit obscure celebrity phone numbers.  The surprisingly long lifespan of Abe Vigoda was a running gag.  The segment also included discussion of prank calls (including Anthony's calls to funeral homes), a disastrous gig playing music at a closed-casket funeral, and a listener's suggestive drawing of Lamb Chop.  A Maxim magazine spread and an interview with The Rock were briefly mentioned, including a quote about geopolitical nuclear tensions. The segment concluded with a planned "Mighty Mouse" musical tribute to its deceased creator, who died from smoking-related cancer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock in New York, Two for Tuesday with you two from the Joshua Tree, in God's country, and Rattle and Humball brought you Desire.  I almost forgot it was Two for Tuesday.  Yes, it's Opie and Anthony, and actually sitting in for a while is Mark Golan from Maxim Magazine, the editor-in-chief.  I bow to you. I bow to Mark right now.  We love the publication.  We love the publication.  Yeah, Maxim is our favorite magazine, and Mark's going to hang with us and tell us some fun stories today, I do believe. 
[00:00:30]  You know, I get butt-hickey with Maxim. I've got to tell you, I've got to be honest. I get butt-hickey.  There aren't many publications that give me butt-hickey, but when I read it in the toilet, in the bathroom, I read it until my legs are completely asleep.  I wake up and fall down, and I have the butt-hickey.  Yeah, well, did you ever get that ring around the butt?  I knew this was a bad idea coming on this show.  Well, Anthony looks like a newborn calf when he gets off the toilet after reading Maxim.  His ass fell asleep. 
[00:01:00]  His legs fall asleep.  He's got a big ring around his butt.  Just a mess.  Yes.  For those of you out there who can't see the poster they're showing me right now, it's ugly.  We've got to talk about the Today Show real fast.  I think they're getting very paranoid of me and you, Anthony.  I think they've taken some black paint and just painted the windows behind Matt and Katie at this point.  They're not even going to that shot where they show the crowd, usually waving with joy and laughter behind them. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  It's over.  Our terrorist boobing is taking place.  We made the Globe rag magazine yesterday.  Don't call it a rag.  We're in it.  Yeah, we're in it.  This is a fine publication next to Maxim.  Next to Maxim.  The New Yorker.  It goes to Maxim, the New Yorker, and then Globe.  The Globe.  Actually, it's a better magazine than Maxim because they put us in there.  You know, up off the Globe, we don't even write anything original for the magazine.  I stumbled upon it while reading about the escape of Bat Boy. 
[00:02:00]  No way.  Is Bat Boy in there?  No, he's actually the news, the weekly world news.  That's the best one.  I can't even afford colored ink for that magazine.  It's just black and white.  I'm telling you, you couldn't keep me out of a 7-Eleven or a Quickie Mart or anything.  Don't you love that?  They found Bat Boy again.  Bat Boy rediscovered.  With the big eyes.  I love that, Matisse.  Bat Boy to get sitcom on the WB.  Right after Moesha.  But, yeah, they're having trouble at the Today Show.  Yeah.  As reported in the Globe, it says that two New York DJs. 
[00:02:30]  Great.  Thank you for the help.  Wonder who that is.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  That's got to be Rocky Allen.  Right?  He accounts for two DJs, doesn't he?  Doesn't he change the name of the show to just two New York DJs?  That's it.  For now on, we're two New York DJs.  That's perfect.  They are offering $700 to the first woman to bare her breasts on the live show.  Yeah.  Now, it's not $700 anymore.  It's a grand.  A cool grand.  A solid thou.  And I think Mark's going to update it today for us.  Now, wait a second. 
[00:03:00]  Is that a pair or a piece?  $500 per nip.  Per nip.  That is the going rate.  And nip does have to show.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely nip does have to show.  Of course it does.  Because how do you judge how much cleavage is out there before you see nip?  Some women have a good foot of cleavage, and they're still a foot away from nip.  Yeah.  It's problematic.  That's for sure.  It is.  Let's see.  A bare of breasts on the live show, either in the windows behind Matt and Katie, or outside  with weatherman Al Roker, who has his own boob problem.  It says, now the show's execs are terrified they'll end up looking like boobs. 
[00:03:30]  Control room guys have been warned to get their eyes peeled for any gal who appears ready  to drop her top.  Hmm.  So they are petrified.  I watched this morning.  They have this, like, woods scene now behind it.  Looks like they're broadcasting from the forest.  There's also, like, some faint perspiration on Katie's upper lips, sort of nervousness  there.  Oh, yeah.  She never knows.  She never knows.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Boobs that are perkier than her might show up.  It could be scary for her.  And they're doing just real quick live shots now. 
[00:04:00]  They're just bouncing around real fast.  They're not staying on one person too long.  And you see the part of the crowd they go to?  Yeah.  It's strategic now.  They go to people that are from Kentucky.  They're holding up signs.  Or in wheelchairs.  Yeah.  So they're not going to pop up.  But I want to say hello to my mama.  Back there in Kentucky.  Hi, mama.  Face happens to be tattooed on my brain.  We can only dream.  Give me my thousand.  We can only dream. 
[00:04:30]  Give me my thousand.  Very nice.  The bounty is still out there, though.  Yes.  And we can't really talk about it too often because we need them to let their guard down.  No.  Security is worse over there than it is at the U.N.  Yeah.  They're putting up barricades just in case trucks full of boobs come pulling up.  They're using metal detectors but don't know why.  Yeah.  Very nice.  All right.  Well, there you go.  So that's the update on the Today Show prank.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We're ready to rock.  Yes.  Mark's hanging with us today.  We're going to talk about the latest issue of Maxim Magazine a little bit. 
[00:05:00]  A lot of fun stuff in there.  There's a lot of good stuff.  I want to talk about the rodeo thing next when we get back here.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Nirvana.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Mark Golan from Maxim Magazine.  The editor-in-chief.  Quickly.  Editor-in-chief.  Are you really the editor-in-chief?  I am the editor-in-chief.  You have that little placard on the desk and everything?  That one says Ed for her.  That one says Ed for her.  We just got to give out the fax line because people are trying to get in on the President Clinton 
[00:05:30]  contest that we got going on.  The resign or impeach contest.  You have to guess when the President will either be impeached or resign office.  Yes.  Give us the date, your name, and your phone number.  Yes.  And if you hit the date or whoever's closest, or if there's more than one winner, we will  pick it out of a hat.  And you win some prizes.  We have a trip to Washington.  For two.  Also, we're going to give you a copy of Liar Liar.  Going to try to find a blue gap dress, some cigars.  Cigars.  And Mark wants us to find some... 
[00:06:00]  A portly woman for the evening?  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  No, I believe I said fat chick, actually.  I think you did.  We could say fat chick in our show.  Monica is.  Yeah.  So the fax line is 212-957-WNEW to get your guesses in.  You can only do it during our show because I don't think the other guys around here really  want to deal with this contest.  No.  No.  I can't see Scottsville getting those faxes.  What is this?  The more crap that those idiots are doing.  That would be funny, right?  They're ruining my station.  Get them off. 
[00:06:30]  Also, through the NEW website, if you click on our pictures, you could do it that way  as well.  We've got a little contest page for you.  All right?  Good.  So make sure you get your guesses in.  This is a legitimate contest.  We don't know if he's actually going to leave office, but...  Yeah.  If he doesn't, it's a wash.  Yeah.  And then we get to go to Washington, I guess.  So...  But we've got to talk about Maxim Magazine.  Mark is here.  He's hanging with us.  He's a cool guy.  We like Mark.  What does it say at the top of the cover?  It says it all.  It does say it all.  It says, sex, sports, beer, gadgets, and clothes. 
[00:07:00]  Maxim Magazine for men.  It's everything a guy wants in a magazine.  I know a lot of women that are checking out this magazine, though, too, as well.  They find it entertaining.  That's true.  It's true.  This is like the guy's playbook, though, I think.  It goes across all genders and species.  Yeah.  The women have Cosmo, and the guy's got, like, Maxim.  This is like our playbook, I think.  You know, I used to be a Cosmo.  Really?  You were?  I used to be the deputy editor of Cosmo.  Right before Maxim.  What responsibilities does deputy editor have?  Wear bags.  Had a gun.  I walked around the streets.  I'm sorry, ma'am. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to have to see those.  No, Andy!  I'm the new law.  Did you have to get the ladies ready for their photo shoot?  Oh, ladies ready for photo shoot.  I came up with all those relationship love articles.  Really?  Franchise your G-spot and make big money.  Things like that.  That was you.  That was you.  That was me.  Right on.  I like the back of Cosmo, because my mother used to subscribe to it.  They always had that, what is it, Cosmo tells all?  Yeah.  It was always a naked picture.  Naked woman picture on there.  I always appreciated that in Cosmo.  Of course, especially when you were 10. 
[00:08:00]  Of course.  You know, where else were we going to get our porno when we were 10 years old?  We didn't have the internet.  Maybe trip on that pile of Playboys we always talk about in the woods.  Yep.  Well, there's always a soft spot in my heart for National Geographic.  I think every guy.  Yeah.  You know?  Is that what your love for the magazine came from?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  National Geographic.  I'm like, I want to be an editor when I grow up.  A Bushman of the Kalahari issue.  Woo!  Oh, women.  Women of the Serengeti.  I love this. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  This girl's 10, and they're down to her knees already.  That gravity, really a lot stronger in Africa.  Those weights, those things, those, like, metal bracelets and stuff to hang on them.  They like to decorate them in all sorts of ways over there.  They ought to have invented something for the boob, like they did to hold their head up on their neck.  Right.  Remember how they stretched the neck?  Mm-hmm.  Like some kind of ring that would have held their boobs up.  I guess that's not a thing of beauty over in Africa for some reason.  Having them point northward for a change.  That would be nice.  So, I was tooling through this issue of Maxim Magazine. 
[00:09:00]  I want to talk to you about something.  This rodeo thing, is it real?  No, we made it up.  You made it up?  I figured that.  No, it's absolutely real.  It's Angola.  I love that name.  Angola Prison.  Mm-hmm.  Angola Prison Rodeo down near New Orleans.  They do it once a year, I guess.  Actually, from what I understand, the prison itself is a pretty tough place.  Mm-hmm.  White boys like us would not last too long.  No.  Oof.  And the queen of the weight room ball.  Ah.  We'd be worth about two packs of cigarettes. 
[00:09:30]  Jeez.  I hope he's at least a carton.  Oh, yeah.  Me and you would be two packs.  We'd be like a...  That blonde hair.  Oh, forget it.  It'd be over for you.  Menthol.  I'd be a half-stomped-out butt.  That would be it.  Take him.  Look at this slob.  Give him to the kitchen, guys.  Give him to the kitchen, guys.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Yeah, so they do this every year, and the culmination, the thing everybody waits for 
[00:10:00]  is these guys, you know, four of them sit down in the middle of the bullpen at a table  and play a game of poker.  Deal out of hand.  They let a bull loose.  The bull charges them.  The last guy to get up from the table wins.  So we've got to sit there until the bull actually hits the table, pretty much.  Basically, yeah.  And what does he win?  Nothing.  Absolutely not.  He's a prisoner, for crying out loud.  What is he going to win?  Why would you even want to do that?  Soap on a rope.  I don't want to talk.  Time alone in the shower. 
[00:10:30]  Preparation agent.  One hour of Ally McBeal.  That's amazing.  Actually, speaking of prisons, I notice for a future issue, you're encouraging inmates  to start writing you letters and stuff.  Indeed we are.  We were getting tired of normal people writing us letters.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  And the magazine's quite popular in prison.  Although, we just had something where it was, I don't know, something like how to hide  a dead body or how to fashion, you know, weapons out of things you'd find in a prison. 
[00:11:00]  There was some reason why a prison decided that nobody could read it anymore there.  I mean, we actually got a letter.  We had been kicked out of a prison.  Whoa.  Oh, damn you.  I don't know.  I'm pretty proud of it.  Not keeping up with prison morality.  So, what do you want the inmates to write you?  Well, I'm just basically, you ever see that show Oz on HBO?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really good.  That's a very good show.  Pretty brutal, yeah.  All the time.  Mm-hmm.  And just suddenly it was like, wow, this is fascinating.  I want to hear what it's really like.  What do they do day to day? 
[00:11:30]  In fact, I always wonder, like, how does all this crap happen?  How do they beat each other up?  How do they fashion weapons and do these things when they're locked in a cell most of the time?  Yeah.  So.  You didn't see the special that Ted Koppel did?  Where he, I actually spent time in a prison cell.  I saw that.  Did you see that?  That was how phony is that?  Like, they put him in the prison garb, and he knows he's in there for, like, what, two hours?  Yeah.  I did my stint in prison.  Uh, I'm, I'm cowing down now on what they call grub here.  Grub?  What the inmate calls grub. 
[00:12:00]  Here I am eating it with a safety fork, so I cannot shank anyone in the yard, lest I feel  like shanking somebody with my shiv.  Here's a, uh, brutal potpourri of vegetables and meat, and.  They're communicating, like somebody wanted to communicate with Ted, so they actually  take string and tie it to combs, and then wing it out, uh, under their door, and then  another guy will take a string with a comb and, uh, hook the other guy's comb, and then 
[00:12:30]  wheel it in, and they could get messages back and forth.  So, uh, Ted Koppel's making it like it's very important he gets this guy's message, so  he's trying to fish, and it probably took him, like, an hour, two hours to get this and  get the message in.  Yeah, editing.  So, uh, he could get the message, and then five minutes later, he's with the camera talking  to the guy.  So, I read in your message.  Well, why didn't you just walk up to the cell in the first place?  Do you really think I'm cute?  Or are you just saying that because I'm famous?  Now I'm taking a shower. 
[00:13:00]  Here, hello, Bubba.  Let me pick up that soap for you.  The final indignity of prison.  The flesh shank.  So, you're looking for the inmates.  You can't say that on the radio, right?  The flesh shank.  Yeah, I guess so, because I didn't go for the dump button.  Yeah.  It's out there now.  That's all right.  But, so you want the inmates to write you some letters.  Absolutely.  Yeah, just, you know, what they do day-to-day, uh, hobbies.  Okay.  All right. 
[00:13:30]  The Jesus, you know.  Where they buried their last victim, man.  Yeah, sure.  You know what, though?  We did get, we actually got a box of, uh, prison-made weapons.  Really?  That we're going to shoot and put in the magazine.  It's amazing.  Pretty inventive, yeah.  Enormously inventive.  I mean, they take a knife and they sharpen it.  Oh, really?  Is that it?  No.  No.  What's the thickest weapon you saw, and how did they make it?  Well, no, it wasn't, I can't remember how it was made, but there was actually this phenomenal  crack pipe that they made out of, like, I don't know, toilet paper and toothpicks 
[00:14:00]  or something, and, yeah, somebody's snot or whatever.  It was just, like, all put together.  All this energy expended, right?  It was great.  It was great.  So, Clint Eastwood in the movie got out of Alcatraz, but this guy's making crack pipes.  Right, yeah, and, uh, and the souvenir drinking birds that, like, keep dunking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They make those, but they brought the box into the offices at maximum, and I swear to  God, everybody dropped what they're doing.  We're all going through this thing like it's Christmas.  It was amazing.  Awesome.  Running around the office and stuff. 
[00:14:30]  I could, uh, tell you how you, to make one prison weapon.  All right.  I learned about this from a con, actually.  You take a fiberglass filter from a cigarette, and you burn it until it melts, and you put  it on a tile floor, and you stomp on it, like, with a boot heel, and it gets really  hard, and you can sharpen it like a razor blade.  Yeah.  It flattens out, gets hard, because it's fiberglass, and then you can sharpen it, make it like  a razor.  Like, kill a squirrel?  Yeah.  You could, like, kill any squirrels in the yard, you know.  No, it works like a box cutter for slashing, you know. 
[00:15:00]  There's a squealer.  You want to give them the mark of the squealer?  Sure, you lousy screw.  All these squirrels, they do my bidding.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday, with lonesome George Thorogood.  I drink alone in bed to the bone.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Mark Golan from, uh, Maxim Magazine.  Look who stopped in, Opie.  And that's your aunt, I believe, Anthony.  It's my aunt Fran.  Hi.  And Cherry.  Hi, guys.  From Cali.  She got new boobs?  Got new boobs. 
[00:15:30]  You got new boobs?  Let me see.  I didn't even know this.  Oh.  You didn't know this?  Oh, yeah, you used to be very flat-chested.  Wow, you got them.  How long ago did you get those?  They're seven years old now.  Seven years old.  How many is that in boob years?  I don't know if there's a correlation there.  Why are we staring at your aunt's friend's boobs?  That's all right.  It's not like I'm staring at my aunt's boobs.  Wow, this is cool.  They're more than seven years old.  I was looking so boring next to this. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  You'll have your relatives come in and talk about their boobs.  Their boobs.  Yeah, by the way, if someone's close to the NAW studios, Mark needs beers.  See, me and Anthony aren't allowed to drink beers while we're on the air, so wink, wink.  Mark needs the beer.  Yeah, that's true.  What does Mark need?  Two cases?  Mark needs about two cases, yeah.  Maybe a...  We need a beer ball.  Yeah.  I guess I'll just sit and drink my O'Douls.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:16:30]  You know, Mark has a new fun game that everyone can play at home.  What is it?  You go through the papers, the New York papers, and you count how many pictures of Monica with her mouth open there are.  Yeah, that's the shot to get in the paper.  Because all of them are, you know.  Aw.  Aw.  Here's Monica having a throat exam.  Aw.  Is that a tongue depressor?  Here's Monica wearing her beret on her tongue.  My Aunt Fran's got a great little take on Monica.  You don't think any guy would even want to date her? 
[00:17:00]  No.  She kisses and tells.  Why would you want to do that?  That's a good point.  No.  That's true.  Do we want to work with the word kiss here a second?  She's low.  She's low life.  Yeah.  I agree, though, because not only does she kiss and tell, she kisses and jots down everything.  Yeah.  And says way too many things.  She's probably got a jar full of Kleenex.  That was file.  That was file.  Oh, my God.  You know, this is why when kids go to school, the words dry cleaning should be in the cat room. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  She just saves it.  Disgusting woman.  And you guys do your Monica of Maryland comparison.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  Well, we were also discussing the fact that, you know, my aunt Fran even said JFK did it.  A lot of the old presidents did it.  We all know Taft was a wild man in office.  Yeah, he couldn't be sober and have that mustache.  Everyone knows he was a madman.  But Kennedy, I think, what, you said it was his taste in women that?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, nobody got down on Kennedy because, well, he had fine taste in women. 
[00:18:00]  You say to yourself, president, private jet, limo, big house, helicopter, Marines following you around and stuff.  He should be able to do better.  Yeah.  And he got Marilyn Monroe.  Marilyn Monroe.  And this is what he got.  It would take a leaf blower to get the dress up off of Monica's butt.  Remember that nice Marilyn Monroe shot where she's over the grating and a little gust of wind.  Monica, you'd have to, you know, fire it up. 
[00:18:30]  We need more power.  You can lift a mummer's skirt easier.  All right, very nice.  Not that I've tried.  Somehow I don't believe that.  I've never tried to lift a mummer's skirt.  Monica lifted it herself, didn't she?  Yeah, she did.  Actually, she lifted her first little encounter with Clinton. 
[00:19:00]  She lifted the back of her jacket up to show she was wearing a thong.  Don't these people feel sorry?  Like she's a little innocent?  She's a little slut.  It's true.  But, you know, they...  Take a break.  All these women, they really, they get on the...  Oh, poor Monica.  She was young.  She didn't know what she was doing.  She knew what she was doing.  She was trying to nail a president.  Most girls go for rock stars.  She had her sights set way higher.  I feel like I'm at my Thanksgiving table.  That's exactly what it sounds like.  Only picture that with ten more people that sound exactly the same. 
[00:19:30]  Really?  Yelling over each other.  It's amazing.  Oh, it's great.  One thing about the thong, though, with Monica, that was misreported.  It wasn't a thong.  It was old woman bloomers.  But over that fat ass, it looked like a thong.  It was stretched to the breaking point.  You know what the real tragedy here, though, is?  I've got to say, it's, you know, I'm Jewish.  Monica Lewinsky is Jewish.  My mom, her big thing, she would get together on Wednesday nights with her Jewish friends  and play Mahjong.  And they'd all talk about, you know, so what's your son doing? 
[00:20:00]  And what's your daughter doing?  And Monica's parents are like, well, my daughter.  And everybody's like, yeah, yeah.  We know.  We know.  Let's skip the Lewinsky's tonight.  Did your mother do it, too?  Yes, it's true.  Our mother did it with the three tenors.  That's good.  Oh, Miss Lewinsky, that's great.  Oh, keep going.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he hits those high notes.  Oh, man.  So, Jen, can I stick around for a while, or? 
[00:20:30]  I think they've got to go to Letterman, right?  I'm going to Letterman.  Yeah.  We work for the CBS organization, and we can't get Letterman tickets.  No, we can't.  They get it.  They get it.  They get it.  Cherry and her new boobs managed to get Letterman tickets.  I get Letterman tickets.  All right.  The real secret is you live in another place.  You say you'll be in town.  You get tickets.  So, you have to lie.  Have some gifts.  My address, you, too, can have tickets.  There's the trick.  Okay.  All right.  And when she goes to Jay Leno, she sends them to my house in New York, saying, I'm going  to be in California. 
[00:21:00]  Look at you two jet-setting all over the post shows across the country.  And opening limo doors.  Huh?  Look at you.  All right.  Well, thanks for stopping by, guys.  Hi, ladies.  All right.  I'll see you on Thanksgiving.  Yeah, I'd hope before that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll stop by.  Tell Grandma I said hi.  Give Grandma a kiss.  I stop by every so often.  I have to.  This is our radio show.  It's a mess.  All right, guys.  Have fun.  And I'm going home to sleep with Grandma. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, I don't even want to get into that.  All right.  Where are you guys from, Kentucky?  Yeah, I know.  With those accents, right?  That's as Long Island as you can get.  All right.  We've got to take a break here, unfortunately.  We should just turn it into a talk show today.  Your aunt's pretty funny, man.  She is.  She's a blast.  Yeah, she is a blast.  You've got to hear around the holiday tables.  It's very funny.  Yeah.  Gets a little irreverent at times.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with David Bowie.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Mark from Maxim Magazine. 
[00:22:00]  I just got to remind people, later this hour, when you hear ZZ Top doing Sharp Dressed Man,  be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 to win tickets to see the Goo Goo Dolls at a taping  of VH1's Hard Rock Live.  That's what I miss from the old days, mentioning ZZ Top.  The old videos.  Remember the old ZZ Top videos with those three girls?  Of course.  You always look forward to the next ZZ Top video.  Yeah, because you knew they would have the hot women.  There's no real videos anymore.  You know, oh, I'm really looking forward to the next Puff Daddy ripoff.  Yeah, here's redoing a Donnie and Marie song for Biggie. 
[00:22:30]  It's all for Biggie.  For Biggie, man.  Yeah.  It's all about the Benjamin.  That guy's loaded.  Puffy, man, cashed in.  I think he got a buck a pound for Biggie.  I've probably figured.  If you figure it out mathematically.  A buck a pound.  He's like, yeah, I'm street boy.  Yeah, from the street, from the hood. 
[00:23:00]  Come visit me in my crib.  Where's your crib?  Oh, right in front of the Bentley.  Halt over here.  That's my accountant in there.  You can tell how rich the rappers are these days, too, by how much they look like Huggy Bear.  From what was that?  Starski and Hutch?  Starski and Hutch.  Yeah.  Wearing a big furry white hat.  I go check up on my bitches.  Holding back some dollars from me.  My bitches. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, how's the hurricane doing, Anthony?  Hurricane George.  I love the tortured weathermen that they got.  They can't say George.  Couldn't have been named George, could it?  Hurricane George moving up the coast.  No, they got to look like idiots now.  Oh, look at the path here.  I'm hurt.  Jesus Christ.  I got to say that.  Hurricane George.  Hurricane Jujubees.  It's like, come on, my TV name's like Mr. J or J, because I can't pronounce my own last name.  I'm a letterman. 
[00:24:00]  George.  It sounds as awkward as when the Spanish channels are going,  In grandeur somera gamades in square garden.  I can go out this way.  Moving up the coast, hurricane alerts out for Florida for hurricane George.  Hurricane George.  Hurricane George.  But it is sweeping over the Dominican Republic right now.  Yeah.  Causing thousands in improvements.  Because it makes its way over there.  Those people have not learned from a simple book. 
[00:24:30]  Not a hurricane book.  Nothing else.  The three little pigs story.  Remember what happened to the straw and stick house?  Try the bricks, people.  Try the bricks.  Every time.  I mean, it's not like the first time a hurricane has hit the Dominican Republic.  No, no, no.  Or Puerto Rico.  I do all the sod in the big wind can.  And my house, it blew away.  What was your house made of?  It was made out of cow crap and straw.  With a tin. 
[00:25:00]  Stain, Nathan.  We're still working on the wheel, okay?  All of a sudden, my house blew away again.  I don't know.  My house, it blew away.  Now we're living the wheel.  Try the bricks.  Try the bricks.  How long have the pyramids been around?  Oh, thousands of years.  What are they made of?  Cement.  Try the bricks.  Made out of bricks.  In the sandstorms, wars.  They blew the nose off the sphinx, but it still stands. 
[00:25:30]  Try the bricks.  I don't know if we're ever going to get to discussing Maxim Magazine.  What's Maxim Magazine?  Oh, yeah.  That's our magazine.  Mark's been sitting there for an hour and a half wondering, well, when is it going to  get to me so I can talk about the magazine?  Actually, we have a question on instant feedback.  My pockets are filled with office supplies now.  We have a question.  Instant email from PJ from Englewood.  Could you ask the editor of Maxim...  This may not be what am I wearing.  No, actually.  It isn't. 
[00:26:00]  Could you ask the editor of Maxim Magazine, could you do a story on the cover-up of aliens?  So, it says extraterrestrial comforters.  Yeah, I know.  Cover-up.  It's new from Revlon.  It's new cover-up for those acne aliens.  Scaled.  I don't know what he means, but he also says it's time Clinton comes clean about the aliens  and Roswell.  Think about it.  He would go from scandal to hero.  Oh, yeah.  That's a link to his problem. 
[00:26:30]  I did not have sex with the Roswell aliens.  I did indeed.  I did indeed have sex with the Roswell aliens.  I don't know what PJ means.  What is your definition of alien?  What do you mean by alien?  Right.  I don't know what you mean.  Well, we got a break again now.  Oh, God.  Jeez.  Well, I want to talk about Maxim Magazine and the world's deadliest things, which is in  this issue.  Oh, that's twisted.  Yeah.  You got a picture of a real dead guy laid out in the magazine. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  Like the autopsy.  It's not a dead guy.  What is it?  It's this guy we found on the internet.  He makes corpses.  It's not a real corpse?  Oh.  It's not a real corpse.  It's like with wood and all this crap and everything.  Oh, we thought it was real.  Oh, okay.  It freaked us out.  The one where he's sitting on a park bench eating?  No.  No.  The guy that's laying down having an autopsy performed on him.  Oh, yeah.  That's a dead guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a dead guy.  Yeah.  That's a dead guy.  That's a dead guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was wondering, how did he make it out of wood? 
[00:27:30]  Come on.  It was like where the blood settled in the back of a guy's head.  What is that?  Oak?  That's made out of wood.  The dead guy.  Cut me a break.  There's so many dead things in here.  It's confusing.  It is a disturbing.  There we go.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That looks dead.  That's a dead guy.  Yeah.  You can order these.  Can you?  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  Oh, yeah.  That I would need in my house.  I once in an apartment I had.  We have one at the office.  We put it at the reception.  We're not getting FedEx anymore. 
[00:28:00]  Scared the medisacal.  I know.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  I had in an apartment I had, a roommate put up a life-size picture of Albert Einstein at  the bottom of the stairs.  And I'd wake up, go to walk down the stairs and turn the light on.  And there's Albert Einstein.  And life-size staring at me scared the bejesus out of me.  Had to get rid of it.  I couldn't imagine walking in and seeing that sitting down on a couch.  It looks like the Crypt Keeper.  The best thing is, he'll sell you parts. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, good.  So you can start.  Well, it's like, you can't fit the whole thing in a fridge.  You can put a head in there, like in a friend's fridge or something.  Great.  That's pretty cool, actually.  All right.  We'll get Mark in his dumb magazine a little bit here.  Oh, man.  Launched a batch of love snot all over her nice blue dress.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to take a f***ing dump.  There he goes. 
[00:29:00]  Lab job.  That is a vile, vulgar sock puppet.  Wow.  Well, you know, we've got a fax here.  By the way, it's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Mark from Maxim Magazine, and you're listening to N.E.W.  We've got a fax here, and we've had many faxes since doing the Lamb Chop bit here on our show.  Yeah.  And everyone is like, come on, guys.  Everyone knows Lamb Chop was a girl.  A little controversy there.  A little controversy.  Lamb Chop was actually a guy.  We'll get him on the phone in a little while to prove it, okay?  Lamb Chop was a guy. 
[00:29:30]  It was Sherry Lewis.  Yeah.  I spoke to Lamb Chop about this, and Lamb Chop's very upset.  Right.  Sherry Lewis dressed up a guy as the little Lamb Chop.  Yeah, but she put the cute little bow in his hair.  Right.  And shoved her fist with a sundown shine, and that's why he's a bitter man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, when you're a sock puppet, you've got nothing if you don't got your dignity.  Right.  Exactly.  And now it seems that this bitterness is coming out when we speak with Lamb Chop.  Right.  So, I guess we can finally start talking about Maxim Magazine with Mark. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's why you're here.  It's the Halloween issue, actually, and it's really good.  A little dark, huh?  It's cool dark, though.  Lots of death and dismemberment.  Yeah.  It's really funny, actually, because the owner of the company, who's over in the UK, because  I think in June, I had an article called Fun Things to Do After You Die, and then I had  like four or five other death articles and so on, and he finally called the other day after  he got this issue and said, are we done with the death?  And I said, of course we are. 
[00:30:30]  It's a new, it's, it's 1999.  Now it's going to be the Antichrist.  Right, right.  Sounds like you got the same boss as me and Anthony.  Are you guys done?  Done with this issue?  Are you guys done with the naked skank whore that recites poetry?  Can we move on?  Move on, please.  But one of my favorite parts of the magazine this month, October, the world's deadliest  things.  This is fun.  Things that are deadly.  This is chipper.  This is chipper.  This makes me giddy like a schoolgirl every time I look at it. 
[00:31:00]  I was surprised at the one thing, like animals, people that are killed by animals every year,  and what animal causes the most human deaths out of any animal.  I was very surprised.  Wait, wait.  I got an idea.  We got some tickets to the Goo Goo Dolls taping.  I'll wait.  But if they have the magazine.  Ah, screw it.  Ah, do it anyway.  Yeah, that means they did their homework.  That's right.  Throw the question out there, Ant.  What's the animal that causes the most human deaths every year?  Okay.  If you know the answer, we'll send you to the Goo Goo Dolls. 
[00:31:30]  212-757-1027.  But quickly, Mark, get back to the world.  Or if you can guess how many erasers I have in my pocket.  Let's get back to the world's deadliest things.  Well, what do you want to know?  We got everything here.  We got the world's deadliest sex act.  What is the world's deadliest?  Oh, that's the thing that Michael Hutchins did, right?  Auto asphyxia.  What is it called?  Auto eroticism.  Auto eroticism.  Ooh.  Auto something.  I can't pronounce it.  It's a really long word.  It's called sex with an automobile, and it's very dangerous.  By the time you say it, you're dead. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  Simple as that.  Claims between 500 and 1,000 lives a year.  Now, this is that whole thing where you choke off your air supply as you orgasm.  Right.  You just got to remember to let it off before you're done.  Yeah.  The release thing.  Great.  Yeah.  You go up to the pearly gates just like that.  The rope running in.  Hey, Peter, you want to let me in?  I think not.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Let's see.  We got the world's deadliest fist. 
[00:32:30]  This is good.  It all depends.  Formerly belonging to Lamb Chopper.  Somewhere inside Lamb Chopper.  But, yeah, this guy during the 1950s, Mas Oyama, who killed 47 bulls by punching them.  He just punched them?  He just punched them.  He just walked up and punched them.  And killed them.  And killed them.  Like blazing saddles.  Yeah.  Like, I always think about, like, this guy, when he'd go to a bar, right, and he'd be sitting  there in a bar, and somebody would start something with him, and he'd go, let me show you something. 
[00:33:00]  He'd walk outside.  He'd bring a bull in and punch it.  Knock him out.  Knock it out, Cole.  Just, like, kill it.  All right.  Let's see.  What other?  World's deadliest things.  World's deadliest things.  We got world's deadliest woman.  Oh, this is a good one.  Michael Owenski.  We have this woman, Urzabet Bathory.  Lived from 1560 to 1614.  She lived in Transylvania.  She killed as many as 650 young girls. 
[00:33:30]  Before being sealed with bricks and mortar inside her home, the infamous castle, and I  can't pronounce this word, C-S-E-J-T-H-E.  And then we have a real helpful pronounced C-A-S-E-T-H-E.  Great.  She should have committed those crimes in the Dominican Republic.  That's right.  Where they build the prisons out of straw.  Right.  And you could just dig out.  You wait for a hurricane.  You wait for a hurricane.  It blows the building down, and you run away.  And you run away.  Legend holds that to keep her skin beautiful, she took long, luxurious baths in the blood of virgins. 
[00:34:00]  All right, so where's the strange part?  They were dirty girls.  Yes, you were.  Let's see.  Death to the audience.  During a screening of the Iranian movie The Deer in Abaddon, Iran, on August 20, 1977,  arsonist torched the cinema, killing an estimated 422 moviegoers.  Those wacky people.  And then we have death to the critic.  Do anything but don't bore me, pleads film critic Leonard Maltin.  The movie that nearly killed him, moment by moment, 1978, in which Lily Tomlin sets her 
[00:34:30]  romantic sights on John Travolta, a stripper imaginatively named Strip.  Oh, jeez.  All right, very nice.  World's deadliest things in this issue of Maxim Magazine.  And we've got our contest going still, right?  Yeah.  That's right.  Deadliest animal or number of erasers in my pocket.  Deadliest animal.  The animal that has killed more people every year.  Mm-hmm.  In the United States.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with Aerosmith.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Mark from Maxim Magazine, the editor-in-chief. 
[00:35:00]  We're having a real good time today, and we're having so much fun, we didn't explain our little  trivia question a little while ago.  That was pretty stupid.  Sorry about that.  Joe picked up on it, though.  He faxed, how is a deer deadly, you moron?  Of course, Maxim Magazine has...  An eloquent protest.  Yeah, yeah.  He's right.  We didn't.  We are morons.  Maxim Magazine has the world's deadliest things in it, this issue.  It's great.  It's got, like, weapons systems, appliance. 
[00:35:30]  The world's deadliest appliance?  Hairdryers?  Is that it?  Hairdryers?  Oh, halogen lamps.  Oh, yeah.  We had one in the other studio we were in.  Before we got fired.  Before we got fired.  Fight.  Fight.  And it was one of those stand-up lamps that have an exposed halogen lamp on top of it.  It might as well just be a torch, like an old cave torch.  That's not bad enough.  Opie would sit and throw rolled-up pieces of paper in it. 
[00:36:00]  Over Anthony's head.  Over my head.  Because the lamp was behind him.  And I would sit there and pick him out and go, knock it off, cut it out.  It was exactly like the episode of Bug Bunny.  Yeah.  With Yosemite Sam, where Bugs would throw the matches in the powder room of the ship.  Oh, you varmints.  You do that one more time.  I'm not going down.  I ain't a going in after it.  And then he plays Jack.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  What was funny about it, I would just throw the paper and wait to see how long it would take. 
[00:36:30]  It's really scary.  That's my second favorite Yosemite Sam one.  My favorite one is where he's trying to cook them, and he keeps running back to the ship  for one match at a time.  Now I've got to go back to the ship and get another match.  Miss me again, you fin-flappin' flounder.  You ferber and idiot.  You hammer-headed halibut.  No!  But Ed, I would throw the paper and I would wait to see how long it would take you to take the paper out. 
[00:37:00]  And I did get to the point where I would go, I am not getting it.  And I swear to you this time, I am not getting it.  And what happened?  I thought it started on fire.  The heat from the fire exploded the bulb.  And I said, see, you happy?  Now we have no light.  And then we got paranoid because they had that sprinkler system at this old radio station.  Yeah, where it just sucks out the air if there's a fire.  They find it in there dead like the Andromeda screen.  I don't know what happens if you breathe in halon gas.  Your blood turns to powder. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't want to chance it.  So I kept retrieving the paper.  All right, so world's deadliest things, yes.  And we put out the question, the deadliest animal in America.  It's responsible for the most deaths per year of humans.  Now the answer was deer.  But we should explain why the deer is the most deadliest animal in America.  Yeah, people thought, you know, shark, grizzly bear, rattlesnakes.  White-tailed deer kill an average of 130 people every year.  Most of these encounters are deer and auto collisions. 
[00:38:00]  See, they jump out, take one for the team.  Yeah, who's the moron now?  That's great.  I mean, it must be like when, you know, you do something for Allah.  You strap a bomb to your body.  Yeah.  Because the deer probably have this guy, you know, you go run in front of the car and kill the infidel.  Highways are the devil's work.  They jump in front of him.  Got another one.  That's yours, Detroit.  Bambi is a martyr. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, we're having a lot of fun.  Mark needs beer, by the way.  No one has brought Mark beer.  Mark had a couple of beers before he came in, he was saying.  If you know how beer works, kids, it wears off.  Yep.  And we don't know what's going to happen to him.  He might turn into a blithering idiot.  No.  If he gets sober.  Too late.  And Mark likes to drink a lot of beer.  And you see, me and Anthony, we're not allowed to drink beer while we're on the air.  So Mark needs about two cases for himself.  Yeah, obviously we wouldn't partake.  But bring him plenty. 
[00:39:00]  For somebody else.  Yes.  Oh, and a six of O'Doul's.  Yes, I'll drink O'Doul's.  O'Doul's light.  You know, so I feel like I'm drinking.  Because I really just like the taste of beer without the wastedness that it gives me.  Just admit it, you like going to the bathroom a lot.  Why don't they come up with a non-alcoholic scotch?  You know, it tastes like rubbing alcohol, but it doesn't get you buzzed.  That's what I drink for, to stay straight.  But you still wake up feeling like crap.  Yeah, could you add that in too? 
[00:39:30]  All right, what else is in Max and Magazine?  We've got to start talking about this thing finally.  Oh, the Office game is awesome.  Explain that, Mark.  Ah, the Office game.  Well, we were sitting around.  We wanted to have some kind of a game.  We wanted to, you know, we like to bring joy and light into people's lives.  And at first we were thinking about a drinking game, but it was going to be one of these things  where you'd really regret playing it because, you know, instead of just like drinking a shot,  you had to drink your shot and have your name legally changed for the rest of your life. 
[00:40:00]  Things like that.  Commitment to the game, yeah.  You had to lose your wife.  You had to turn over your house.  Or you had to wear adult diapers for the rest of your life or something.  And then we thought, well, a drinking game is just plain childish.  Sure.  So instead we decided to do an office game.  And basically the deal here is you get together with four or five of your friends at work  and you all plunk down 20 or 40 bucks.  And then you play this game.  We give you a whole bunch of little pranks to do.  One-point pranks, three-point, and five-point pranks. 
[00:40:30]  And the person that racks up the most number of points at the end of the day wins the pot.  Just to give you a fast idea of some of the pranks.  One-pointers, groan out loud while in a bathroom stall.  At least one other person must be in the men's room.  And then you must follow with, geez, that burns.  Wait a minute.  I think someone in this building is playing that game.  Because I hear that one all the time.  I don't understand that guy in the bathroom, though. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, the guy that's not shy.  Does he have no shame?  The not shy guy.  The not shy guy.  He's always one.  We're up.  Oh, hey, how you doing today?  Oh, you want to hand over some paper?  You seem to be out over here.  Boy, I'm going through half a rope.  How you doing?  Just bring it on in.  The door's open.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on in.  Come on.  Let me show you pictures of my family.  Want to snort?  Got a hip flask here.  I need the thousand-foot radius of nobody around me in the public bathroom. 
[00:41:30]  You sneak in.  You sit there and wait and wait and wait until it's completely empty.  Okay, you start your business.  And then if you hear the squeaky hinge,  Oh, there's someone in here.  Close up like a bank vault.  I'm done.  Stage fright.  Well, it's embarrassing.  And then you're reaching around for the glade, right?  Yeah.  You just dumped a pine forest, right?  Wow.  Whoa.  Smells like Oregon.  That guy's minty fresh.  All right, what's some of the other examples of the office game? 
[00:42:00]  Let's see.  Ignore the first five people who say hello to you in the morning.  That's one point.  That's good.  Phone a co-worker you barely know and leave this voicemail message.  Just called to say that I can't talk right now.  Bye.  Put ketchup, mustard, or Vaseline on the men's room doorknob.  And I was telling you guys, this reminds me of something we did when we were in high school.  We used to go to like a porn palace.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Damn.  Oh, yeah.  Changes my image of you. 
[00:42:30]  Wilmington, Delaware, there's not much to do.  Oh, the opera comes to town so seldomly.  And so we'd go to this porn place, and we'd go into one of the booths, and then on the inside doorknob, we'd paint it with mayonnaise.  Oh, we'd do this to like five or ten of the booths, and then like walk out, and we'd just stand there and wait.  Guys would walk in there, and they'd do whatever they were doing in there and so on, and then they'd reach for the doorknob, and you'd hear them go,  And then they realized like they can't get out because they're not going to use the doorknob, and you have these pathetic men with their pants around their ankles, like banging at the door for somebody to let them out. 
[00:43:00]  Come on, how'd you learn that?  You were the mayonnaise guy, weren't you?  You had it on your hand at some point.  Let me out, okay.  All right.  Boy, this isn't funny anymore.  I learned a great trick, guys.  No, someone told me.  We used to go to the porno place in Bayshore with a bunch of my pals after work.  This is pre-videotaped days.  Now your damn kids have it easy.  You go to the comfort of your own home.  Yeah, the internet.  Hey, we didn't have no internet. 
[00:43:30]  And we used to go to Bayshore, and you know those little bottles of ivory liquid?  You sneak one of those in, and one of the climactic parts of the movie, you just kind of squeeze the bottle and wing your arm around.  So it, like, sprays out into the first ten rows in front of you.  An added feature, you could go.  Oops, seem to have let that one go. 
[00:44:00]  Sorry, sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  You know what?  I don't care who's on network television, as long as it's not Bonnie Franklin.  I freaking hate that woman.  I hate everything about her.  One day at a time, right.  One day at a time, yeah.  That was a good one.  Schneider.  Oh, yeah.  What a great character.  What a tough guy he was.  It was always funny.  Every time he came through the door.  Yeah.  Oh, just screaming with laughter. 
[00:44:30]  Can you feel a little sarcasm?  There's one of those shows that I wish, like, everybody afterwards, like, went to prison.  Like, what was it?  Instead of different strokes.  Different strokes.  What did it happen to that show?  E had a great thing on that.  They had a bio of all the kids from different strokes on E, yeah.  It was one of those cruel Hollywood stories.  Oh, they were on top, but now they're on the bottom, and we're going to show you everything.  Right.  But then at the end, but things are looking up.  Yeah.  It's always looking up at the end.  What the hell is looking up?  Right. 
[00:45:00]  Gary Coleman's still looking up at everybody.  That's the only thing looking up.  And then we're, like, all on a couch, heavily medicated, like, laughing into the camera.  Dana Plato was adorable when that show was on.  What the hell happened to her on that show?  I mean, on the E show.  I was looking at her and going, is that Dana?  She couldn't even be cast as a crack whore these days.  They'd need too much makeup to make her look better.  She looked terrible.  Tightest pair of jeans on television when she was on that show.  Ooh la la Sassoon. 
[00:45:30]  Yes, exactly.  May I say.  Yep.  She needs to be on roller skates.  And I don't even know why.  You ever see the roller skating episode of Chips?  No.  Oh, God, yeah.  You're kidding.  You missed the roller disco episode of Chips?  Me and Anthony, it came on once, and we actually called each other just so we could laugh openly  and discuss the show as it was happening.  Chips was doing a charity at a roller disco, and they had celebrities that just happened to  be on the same network as Chips was.  And they had an announcer bringing everybody out, and to watch it now is even worse, because 
[00:46:00]  it's just, let's give it up for Dan Haggerty.  Dan Haggerty, Grizzly Adams.  And there's this big, dopey, bearded buffoon trying to skate on those big old 70s roller skates.  I'm like, wow.  And now, from eight is enough, it's Dead Zone Tatton.  Here's roller disco, Dead Zone Tatton.  Hey!  Only to be beat by the time Ponch sang Celebrate. 
[00:46:30]  We're going to have a good time tonight.  Let's celebrate.  It's all right.  And he's got this outfit on.  We're going to have a good time tonight.  That's where I want my California Highway Patrolman dancing.  Oh, yeah.  Boogieing down.  Boogieing.  That whole episode, even the crooks were on roller skates.  Yeah, for some reason, everything had to have roller skates in it.  It was a roller skating theme.  So the bank robbers had this clever ploy.  They had big shoes, and they robbed the bank, and they would, like, hit a button on their heel, 
[00:47:00]  and the roller skates would pop out of the shoes, and they'd make their getaway.  Like, if they came into the bank on skates that were just skates, the security guy would  go, hmm, wait a minute.  I'm so dangerous.  Fishy.  Yeah.  He was wearing skates.  He might be robbing us.  But the big, bulky shoes hiding the skate wheels didn't look suspicious.  And, of course, this is all before cars were invented.  Yeah.  Getaway skates.  Getaway skates.  Getaway skates.  A lot easier.  All right.  Very nice.  Great.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry for out there for just reflecting on my youth. 
[00:47:30]  Somebody should, like, do the cool thing with, you know, like, musical moments from  70s shows.  I was just watching Happy Days with Leather Tuscadero.  Yes.  By the way, she was gross.  I know.  As a kid, I thought she was the hottest thing.  You know what the scary one was?  They had one episode.  Not that I watch this all the time.  I'm just sure you did.  Nickelodeon.  But the one where, like, not Posse, the other one.  Ralph Mouth.  Ralph Mouth.  Ralph Mouth.  Ralph asks her to, like, this formal military prom thing when they're going to ROTC or something 
[00:48:00]  like that.  And so she spends the whole show, like, learning to be a lady.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Only equaled by the time Fonzie and Pinky Tuscadero were riding motorcycles together in a love  sequence.  Have they had the love music?  Oh, yeah.  And they're jumping.  Yeah.  They should, like, shoot each other with a finger gun.  In love.  You know, Anthony makes a good point about Fonzie, though, in Happy Days.  We only saw him beat up one guy in one episode. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, he was always tough.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Posse.  My office.  Hey.  Hey, Cunningham.  And he was always like, they were always afraid of him.  Right.  Yes, Posse.  Yes.  Of course, Posse.  Yes.  Oh, oh, oh, yes, Posse.  But you never saw him beat anyone up.  Yeah, but it was a zen kind of cool.  Was that it?  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe, like, the first season where it was still on film and not in front of a live audience.  Right.  Like, when they, after a while, they bring Chachi in, the whole audience, and they got 
[00:49:00]  to do that stop-start line thing.  Like, they walk in, hey, Mrs. C, I, hey, Mrs. C, I'm going to be at the garage.  You know, they have to stop their line and start it up.  Oh, too much.  Love those shows.  Nickelodeon.  Nope.  I fall asleep to them.  Wake up to them.  Chachi.  Chachi now.  Chachi.  Like, someday I want to do this thing where it's, like, people that will take your calls.  You know?  Like, I bet you could call up, what's his name? 
[00:49:30]  Scott.  Scott Baio.  He got Baio.  I bet you could, like, answer the phone.  And he'll, like, answer the phone.  Of course he will.  And talk to you a little bit.  Like, you could be the Anderson window salesman, and he'd probably, like, keep you on the line  for five minutes.  Well, me and Anthony play a game for a beer.  Alive or dead.  Alive or dead.  Yeah, we did it with, um...  Wheel doggie.  Wheel doggie, yeah.  Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson.  And we did it with Henny Youngman and, uh...  Tiny Youngman before he died.  Before he died.  And Tiny Tim before he died.  And what we do is we get the phone numbers of these celebrities.  We call them at home to see if they'll answer and if they're alive or dead.  It's usually celebrities you haven't heard from in a while. 
[00:50:00]  And we bet a beer.  And then we have to explain the game to the celebrity when he's on the phone with us.  It's pretty embarrassing.  Just in case you didn't know.  Yeah.  Well, you're alive.  It's not true anymore.  Right.  Here's a couple young punks from New York.  By the way, we're looking for Abe Vigoda's phone number.  You can actually go a little bit farther.  Alive, dead, or Canadian.  Yes.  Well, actually, we played the game with Mr. Drucker from Green Acres.  Sam Drucker.  And we honestly didn't know if he was alive or dead.  And we found his home number.  Someone faxed it in to us.  And we called. 
[00:50:30]  And it was hysterical.  Yeah, he was right there.  The guy that, you know, wow.  Hello.  And I kept calling him Sam Drucker.  His name isn't Sam.  I don't know what it is, but it's not Sam, Opie.  But it's so embarrassing when you've got to explain it.  Yeah, well, I lost a beer.  And he goes, why did you lose a beer?  Well, you see, we had this stupid bed.  I thought you were dead.  You're breathing.  Yeah, you're breathing.  You're breathing is the problem.  All right.  Oh, great.  Thanks for calling.  Right.  All right.  If we play any music on our show today, you've got to be listening for T-Rex Bang-A-Gong.  If you're the 10th caller, when you hear that song at 212-757-1027, we're going to see it. 
[00:51:00]  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Van Halen.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Mark from Maxim Magazine.  I don't even think we discussed Maxim Magazine today at all.  But that's okay.  We're having fun anyway.  I think we kind of did.  Yeah, a little bit.  We touched on it.  Right, Mark?  It's a magazine.  It's a magazine.  Screw it, right?  It's paper with pictures and words.  Yeah.  That's about it.  I found the Buddy Epson call because we're getting a ton of people calling saying, no 
[00:51:30]  way did you guys play Alive or Dead.  We were explaining our little game that me and Anthony play from time to time.  Matter of fact, if you've got some phone numbers of old-time celebrities, their home  numbers, please send them in to the Opie and Anthony show through the email or fax them  to us so we could continue the Alive or Dead game.  And he doesn't have a few lying around.  Yeah.  You never know.  We get our best stuff from the listeners.  It's a rough game sometimes because the obvious ones, you don't usually get those. 
[00:52:00]  You know, like a fish.  Yeah.  Abe Vigoda.  Yeah.  Alive or Dead.  He's in the Alive.  He's in his own category.  There's an Abe Vigoda category.  You know, those celebrities you thought were dead but they're still alive?  That is spended animation.  That's Abe Vigoda.  He's still alive but a lot of people think he's dead.  Okay, John Banner.  John Banner?  He was Schultz in Hogan's Heroes.  Alive.  Alive?  Dead.  Dead.  See?  Okay.  You'd have lost.  I would have lost that game.  All right.  How about the guy that played Colonel Klink? 
[00:52:30]  Werner Klepper.  He's alive.  Alive.  Okay.  Now, if you would have bet dead, you would have had to call him up and tell him why we're  calling, which is very embarrassing.  That's the worst part of it.  Basically, me and Anthony bet a beer.  We pick a celebrity.  We get their phone number.  We call it home.  And then we have to break the news why we're calling and why, you know, we lost a bet.  Whoever lost a bet has to tell him.  Isn't that horrible?  Well, so I found the Buddy Epson one, the time we played with Buddy Epson.  Can we call Colonel Klink after this? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, good.  All right.  So here's a live or dead with Buddy Epson that me and Anthony played.  All right.  Here is Mr. Epson.  One moment.  All right.  Hello?  Mr. Epson.  Yes, indeed.  Buddy.  Yeah.  How you doing?  You want an identification?  Well, doggie.  Yeah.  Buddy Epson.  It is Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, you just won me a beer.  I won you a what?  Yeah, we had a bet going.  Where's my percentage? 
[00:53:30]  See, I bet that you were dead.  And Opie said no.  He had faith.  And obviously, you're alive and kicking and doing fine.  Well, I'm kicking.  Yeah, I'm doing fine.  Yeah, sure.  You still doing any hoofing?  Hoofing?  You're a big dancer.  The doctor told me I could still dance, but dance a little closer to the floor.  Hey, that's funny.  You ever see Jethro?  I can't see him.  Max?  I hear him.  I just opened the window and he's in Vegas. 
[00:54:00]  I can hear him.  Really?  Hey, he's a wonderful guy.  And what about Granny?  She died, though, right?  Kid!  Kid!  Kid!  Where's my rheumatism medicine?  Yeah, very good.  Well, thank you.  Hey, Buddy, give us another ooo doggie.  Ooo doggie.  You have to spell that right.  You know, it's W-E-L-L-L-L-L.  That's great.  It's not wee doggie.  It's well doggie.  Well doggie.  We got Barnaby Jones on the phone.  Barnaby Jones, you are fantastic. 
[00:54:30]  A Quinn Martin production.  Hey, you know Miss Hathaway?  She was Mr. Drysdale's assistant at the bank.  Was she a dyke or did you ever see her with guys or anything?  What was the deal with her?  I have no comment.  Oh, boy.  Oh, run killer.  Carpet muncher.  Carpet muncher.  You're a full dyke.  Vegetarian.  And there you have it, our alive or dead game that we played with Buddy Epps in.  Isn't that brutal when you have to listen to the guy explain to him?  That's horrible.  How about Sorrel Brook? 
[00:55:00]  Or Sorrel, yeah, Brook, wasn't it?  Or Book?  He was the guy, Boss Hogg on the Dukes of Hazzard.  He's got to be dead.  Oh, yeah.  Too fat to be alive.  Very good, because he's dead.  Shirley Booth?  She played Hazel, Mr. B.  Oh, she died recently.  Too fat to be alive.  She died last year, yeah.  No, she died in 92.  Oh.  Somebody actually...  I thought it smart, though, didn't I?  Somebody actually emailed us a page of everybody that's alive or dead in that alive or dead category. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Telling if they're alive or dead.  Very nice.  The website.  I'm going to have to...  Well, now we just need their phone number so we can call them and play the game.  Yeah.  So...  All right.  Just the live ones.  Yes.  See, that's the gag.  See, that's the wacky gag, because we can only call them if they're alive.  Do you get it?  No, I mean...  Do you get it, people?  There are widows.  Well, yeah, that's it.  Is Lucille Ball there?  She's dead.  Remember, did you ever have that... 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, what a beer!  Crack it open on the phone.  Did you ever do that when you were a kid?  It was the most horrifying thing, because every kid did prank phone calls.  When you got to the sophisticated...  There were always the prank calls where you're just like...  Is your refrigerator running?  You better go catch it.  Click, and you hang up.  Yeah.  Then there was the sophisticated ones where you figured you'd work something out.  Let me get the phone book.  I'm a mature prankster now.  I'm going to look up someone's name and really freak them out, because I'll have their name. 
[00:56:30]  Yes, is Mr. John Brown at home?  He tried last week.  It would freak you out as a kid?  Slang the phone down.  I'm not doing pranks anymore.  Of course, if you were cold, you went, honey, it's me.  Oh, Jesus.  Mark, Anthony does a prank.  I don't even know if I should bring this up, because then he's going to tell some of the pranks I've done in the past. 
[00:57:00]  But I'll give it a shot here.  Anthony likes to go through the obituary section in a paper, and he calls up funeral homes, and he asks for the deceased.  And then when the guy goes, yeah, he's here...  Because they think you're talking about, like, is their visiting?  Like, is Jim Smith there?  Yeah.  Because they're like, yes, yes, he's in room B, or whatever.  Can I speak with him, please?  Um, what?  I'd like to talk to him. 
[00:57:30]  He's the deceased.  They, like, get horrified.  It backfired so bad one day.  The guy said, hold on, and he got the guy's son, the dead guy's son.  No, his brother.  A brother, who was at the funeral home.  Yeah.  And I was on the phone with him.  Yes, I'd like to speak to John Brown, please.  It's my brother, and he's dead.  Oh, it was hot.  It was horrific.  Wait, I got a great funeral story.  Uh-oh, what'd you do?  I actually play violin, and I used to play with a guitar player, and we'd do this, like, duo thing. 
[00:58:00]  And somebody convinced us to go play at a funeral.  It was going to be, like, awake and all.  Great gig.  Jeez.  So we're figuring, okay, what the hell, let's go do this.  It was, like, in Thompson, Pennsylvania, out in the middle of nowhere.  We go to the funeral home.  We come in.  He's got his electric guitar.  I got my electric violin.  The funeral director, he's, like, perky.  I mean, you know, he's doing good business here, right?  He's like, all right, yeah, come on in here.  Set up in here.  And he takes us in.  We're in this room.  There's an open casket.  It is not awake.  It is a young woman that got hit by a car. 
[00:58:30]  She's 30.  Oh, no.  It's tragic as all hell.  Oh, no.  We set up.  There's people in there all watching the coffin and everything.  And Mike and I are, like, standing there going, so what do we play?  It's like, what?  What, sophisticated lady?  You know, ladies of tramps?  You know, old standards.  We play, like, jazz things, right?  And I'm like, all right, let's just play something really sad in E minor.  So we start playing.  It's like weepy things.  Everybody in the room bursts out playing.  After, like, three minutes, I'm like, Mike, this is not working. 
[00:59:00]  Let's get out of here.  So I say to the funeral director, I don't think this is working very well.  Maybe we should just get out of here.  We're in the room with a body, all right?  And the mourners.  This guy, he's, like, talking at the top of his lungs.  What?  You're leaving?  Oh, what a shame.  The music's so nice.  I'm like, look, can you just open a door for us?  He goes, sure.  He swings these doors open in the very same room that leads straight out to the road with cars going  by and everything, trucks and stuff. 
[00:59:30]  What a gig.  I mean, we slunk out of there.  I was in a band, and I was in a few bands, and I never had a gig that bad.  This is bad.  The funeral director didn't go, um, I'm not going to be able to pay you.  You didn't bring many people.  Load-ins at 8 o'clock sharp.  You missed the time.  You're not going to be able to play.  You're going on with three other bands, and you have the last slide.  Great.  The best line.  Nobody's dancing.  No one's dancing.  The best line, though.  All right, so we set off.  Set off. 
[01:00:00]  1-0-2-7-WNEW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  I think me and Anthony played four twofers today.  That's one of them.  T-Rex, Jeepster, and Bang-A-Gong, which means we got a winner for the Goo Goo Doll tickets.  How many tunes did we play today, seriously?  Not many.  Six, maybe?  I think every time we did a break, it was a twofer.  We talked twofer times more than we usually do.  We had fun today, man.  Yeah, we got to thank Mark from Maxim Magazine for coming in today.  You got to pick up a copy of Maxim. 
[01:00:30]  It's a fun magazine.  Look at it.  I'm holding it up at the mic right now.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great spread of What's-Her-Name on the cover there from Urban Legend.  You know what I like the most about Maxim?  Is at the back page, you do the fold thing, and it makes the picture.  No, that's...  Oh, I thought that was the other magazine.  Poor freaking hours.  Come on.  Thanks a lot.  Poor wasted, stupid freaking hours.  I tease because I love. 
[01:01:00]  Thank you.  What are you doing tomorrow?  We could use the help.  Are we available for Fanatic?  Yeah, yeah.  We want to let MTV know that we're available for Fanatic.  Yeah.  If anyone wants to meet us.  I don't think anybody would be thrilled, though.  The co-worker comes and gets them, and they take them off to meet their favorite celebrity.  It would be like, you're meeting Opie and Anthony.  Look, I got to get some stuff done here.  I'm really busy.  I do wrong.  They're showing the MTV Fanatic where the one guy wanted to meet Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[01:01:30]  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  I'm going to open up a can of whoop-ass.  And the guy shaved his head.  Look at these coals.  Yeah.  He shaved his head just like Stone Cold.  Yeah, that's what Stone Cold wants to see, how much of a loser you are.  You think you're like Stone Cold?  You're not going to be like Stone Cold when I open up a can of whoop-ass.  All right, Stone Cold.  Great.  What are you doing?  I love the wrestling because you just can't picture these guys walking around like this 24 hours a day. 
[01:02:00]  Can I just bring up this one thing?  We did this thing.  Oh, I see this in maximum.  Stage advice from the WWF.  Yeah, you talked to, who was that?  We talked to Rocky Navier.  The Rock.  Right?  We asked them serious questions.  This month, in recent months, the security of Asia has been undermined by India and Pakistan,  both of which have conducted successful nuclear weapons tests.  The U.S. has issued strong statements of disapproval, and other nations have condemned the two countries.  How should the U.S. and its allies handle the situation? 
[01:02:30]  But what did The Rock say?  The only nuclear weapons that these two countries have to worry about are The Rock's 22-inch nuclear guns being wrapped around their necks.  If this nonsense continues, then the people's champ, The Rock, will team with President Clinton in the squared circle.  A pile driver to Pakistan.  A suplex to India.  Turn out the lights.  The party's over if you smell what The Rock is cooking. 
[01:03:00]  That's great.  That's awesome.  Hey, one of our faithful listeners drew a sketch of what they think Lamb Chop looks like now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I've got to scan this and put it on the website.  We're going to scan that and put it on our underground website.  Lamb Chop gets legs.  That could be a new thing we'll do tomorrow, you know, because we have a lot of active listeners out there that like to get involved with the show.  Make a sketch of what you think Lamb Chop looks like these days and fax it in when we're on the air tomorrow from 3 to 7. 
[01:03:30]  It's old enough of a book, I Am Not Lamb Chop, by Artie.  Yeah.  Explain the facts real fast.  Well, Artie, a.k.a. Lamb Chop, is smoking a big cigar, has the goatee, which in any 60s or 70s wacky sitcom, whenever they had the evil twin episode, would always have a goatee.  Gilligan had it.  True.  The evil Gilligan.  And you've got to put the beret on him, too, to make him look good.  The evil Spock had the goatee. 
[01:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Jan had the evil goatee.  Jan Brady had the goatee.  And it's saying, hey, tell that bitch who didn't like me to go ever to the, he's got the leather outfit on.  Big tattoo, Artie, with an F.U. rattlesnake tattoo on the other side.  And might I say a huge package of Lamb Chop.  Very impressive for a sock puppet.  Yeah.  He underdrew the unit.  Underdrew the unit? 
[01:04:30]  I'm a lot bigger than it.  Wow.  He's packing quite a bit of wool.  Man, wow, what time?  Is it 10 o'clock?  Yeah, we had fun.  We've got to go.  Yeah.  We've got to go back to our miserable lives.  Thanks.  Tomorrow's when for Wednesday.  And then third for Thursday.  All right.  Hey, can we leave with our Mighty Mouse sub bit?  Oh, no.  Oh, you just want to take off even more people than we have today.  Well, Mark hasn't heard it yet, and he's a guest, and we like to share our bits with our guests, Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  Okay, so explain what happened to the creator of Mighty Mouse.  Well, actually, it was the guy that wrote the song.  Right.  That everyone knows.  Right.  He, like many people that children love, died of cancer from smoking too much.  They didn't know in the 50s, Opie.  They didn't have the information that we have today.  Yes.  So, and we, you know, had a little tribute.  No, it's a cute little musical tribute. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
