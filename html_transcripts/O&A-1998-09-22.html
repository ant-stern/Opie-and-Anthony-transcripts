I bow to Mark right now. We love the publication  We love the publication  Maxim is our favorite magazine and Mark's gonna hang with us and tell some fun stories today 
[00:30]
 I do believe you know I get butt-hicky with Maxim. I gotta tell you I gotta be honest  I get butt-hicky there aren't many publications that give me butt-hicky, but when I read it in the toilet in the bathroom I  Read it until my legs are completely asleep. Mm-hmm. I wake up and fall down and  I have the butt-hicky. Yeah, well you get that ring ring around the butt. I knew this is a bad idea coming on  Well, Anthony looks like a newborn calf when he gets off his toilet after reading Maxim  his ass 
[01:00]
 Is asleep you like fall asleep? He's got a big ring around his butt. Just a mess. Yes  And for those of you out there who can't see the poster they're showing me right now. It's ugly  We gotta talk about the today show real fast  I think they're getting a very paranoid of me and you and tonight  I think they've taken some black paint and just painted the windows behind Matt and Katie at this point  They're not even going to that shot. They show the crowd usually waving with joy and laughter behind them 
[01:30]
 Yeah, it's it's over our tourist boobing is is taking place  We made the globe rag magazine yesterday. Don't call it a rag. Oh, we're in it. Yeah, we're a fine publication  next to Maxam Yorker  It goes to Maxim the New Yorker and then globe  The globe actually it's a better magazine than Maxim because they put us in there, you know off the globe  We don't even write anything original for the I stumbled upon it while reading about the escape of Batboy 
[02:00]
 And I always that boy in there. No, he's actually the news the weekly world news  That's the best one. I can't even afford colored ink for that magazine. It's just black and white  I'm telling you you couldn't keep me out of a 7-eleven or a quickie Mart or anything  They found that boy again bad boy rediscovered with the big eyes  Love that Matisse back way to get sitcom on the WV  right after Moesha  But yet I haven't trouble at the Today Show. Yeah as  Reported in the globe 
[02:30]
 It says that two New York DJs great time to the help wonder who that is. Yeah. Oh my that's gotta be Rocky Allen  I  He accounts for two DJs doesn't he change the name of the show to just two New York DJs  Yeah, but now I'm or two New York DJs. That's perfect  They're offering $700 to the first woman to bear her breast on the live show. Yeah now it's not $700 anymore  It's a grand a cool grand a solid thou and I think Marc's gonna update any today for us  And now wait, is that a pair or a piece 500 per nip per that is the going rate? Yeah 
[03:00]
 And it does have to show yes, yes, yes definitely  Because how do you you know judge how much cleavage is out there before you see nip some women have a good foot of cleavage  And there's still a foot away from nip. Yeah, it's problematic. That's for sure. It is  Let's say a bear the breasts on the live show either in the windows behind Matt and Katie or outside with weatherman Al Roker  Who has his own boob problem?  It says now the show's execs are terrified to lend up looking like boobs 
[03:30]
 Control room guys have been warned to keep their eyes peeled for any gal who appears ready to drop her top  Hmm, so they are petrified. I watched this morning. They have this like wood scene now behind  Looks like they're broadcasting from the forest  Also like some faint perspiration on Katie's upper lip sort of nervousness there. Oh, yes, you never know  I never know like that boobs that are perkier than her might show up  It could be scary 
[04:00]
 And they're doing just real quick live shots now they're just bouncing around real fast  You know they're not staying on one person too long and you see the part of the crowd they go to yeah  It's strategic now. They go to people that are from Kentucky. They're holding up sign. We're in wheelchairs  We can only dream  We can only dream 
[04:30]
 Bounty is still out there though  Yeah, and we can't really talk about too often because we need them to let their guard down  No security is is worse over there than it is at the UN. Yeah, they're putting up barricades  Just in case trucks full of boobs come pulling up  They're using metal detectors, but don't know why  All right, well there you go, so that's the update on the today show prank mm-hmm all right  We're ready to rock Mark's hanging with us today  We're gonna talk about the latest issue of Max of magazine a little bit a lot of fun stuff in there

[06:30]
 We got a little contest page for you all right good, so make sure you get your guesses in  This is a legitimate contest. We don't know if he's actually gonna leave office, but if he doesn't it's a wash  Yeah, and then we get to go to Washington. I guess so but we got to talk about Max and magazine mark is here  He's hanging with us. He's a cool guy. We like mark. What does it say at the top of the cover?  Says it all it does says say it all it says sex sports beer gadgets and clothes 
[07:00]
 Max a magazine for men everything a guy wants in a magazine  I know a lot of women that are checking out this magazine though too as well. They find it entertaining  That's true. It's true. This is like the guys playbook though  I think it goes across all genders and species yeah the women have Cosmo and the guys got like Maxim  This is like our playbook. I think you know I used to be a Cosmo really you were  I used to be the deputy editor of Cosmo. What is it? What were Maxim what responsibility is the deputy editor?  We're bad  Had a gun I want to read I'm sorry ma'am. I'm gonna have to see those 
[07:30]
 Did you have to get the ladies ready for their photo shoot ladies ready for photo shoots?  I came up with all those relationship love articles really franchise your g-spot make big money  That was you  I like the in the back of Cosmo because my mother used to subscribe to it  They always had that was Cosmo tells all yeah, there's always a naked picture naked woman picture on it  I always appreciated that in Cosmo of course especially when you were ten of course you know where else were we gonna get our porno when? 
[08:00]
 We were ten years old. We didn't have the internet maybe trip on that pile of playboys  We always talk about in the woods. Yep. Well. It's always a soft spot in my heart for National Geographic  I think every guy yeah, you know that would go your love for Matt the magazine came from oh, yeah  Absolutely, I said in there like I want to be an editor when I grow up  Bushman of the Kalahari issue  Women of the saranguetti 
[08:30]
 Wow this girl's ten and they're down to her knees already  Gravity really a lot stronger in Africa wait those things like metal bracelets  They like to decorate them in all sorts of ways over there  They ought to have invented something for the boob like they did to hold their head up on their neck  Remember how they stretch the neck mm-hmm like some kind of ring that would have held their boobs up  I guess that's not a thing of beauty over an after having having them point northward for change  That would be nice, so I was tooling through this issue of Max of magazine 
[09:00]
 I want to talk to you about some this rodeo thing is it real no we made it up you made it up  I figured that no it's absolutely real. It's a angola  I love that name Angola prison mm-hmm Angola prison rodeo down here in New Orleans. They do it once a year I guess  Actually from what I understand the prison itself is a pretty tough place  White boys like us would not last too long  And the queen of the weight room ball  We'd be worth about two packs of cigarettes 
[09:30]
 Hope he's at least a cart  You would be too bad we'd be like a blonde hair forget it  I'd be a half stomped out, but  Give them to the kitchen guys  Very nice very nice  Yes, and they do this every year and then and the culmination the thing everybody waits for is these guys 
[10:00]
 You know four of them sit down in the middle of the bullpen  With a table and then and play game of poker deal out of hand  They let a bull lose the bull charges them the last guy to get up from the table wins  And we got to sit there until the bull actually hit the table pretty much. Yeah, and what does he win?  Absolutely nothing. He's a prisoner for crying out loud  Why would you even want to do that soap on a rope? I don't  I'm alone in the shower 
[10:30]
 The preparation agent talks one hour of Ali McBeal, that's amazing actually speaking of prisons  I noticed for a future issue you're encouraging inmates to start writing your letters and stuff indeed  We are we were getting tired of normal people writing us letters. Mm-hmm  really  Magnet is quite popular in prison. Although we just had something where it was a I  Don't know something like how to hide a dead body or how to fashion  You know weapons out of things you find in a prisoner there's some reason why a prison decided that nobody could read it anymore there 
[11:00]
 I mean, we actually got a letter. We have been kicked out of a prison. Whoa. Damn you. I don't know  I'm pretty proud of not keeping up with prison morality. So what do you want the inmates to write you? Well  I'm just basically you ever see that show Oz on HBO. Yeah. Yeah, it's really good  I'm a very good job pretty brutal. Yeah all the time. Mm-hmm  And just suddenly was like wow, this is fascinating. I want to hear what it's really like. What do they do day to day? 
[11:30]
 In fact, I always wonder like how's all this crap happen? How does how they beat each other up?  How do they fashion weapons and do these things when they're locked in a cell most of the time?  So you didn't see the special that Ted Koppel did where he I actually spent time in a prison cell  They put him in the prison garb and he knows he's in there for like what two hours  I did my stint in prison. I'm I'm cowing down now and what they call grub here 
[12:00]
 What the inmate calls grub here I am eating it with a safety fork so I cannot shank anyone in the yard  Unless I feel like shanking somebody with my shiv  brutal potpourri of vegetables and meat and  They're communicating like somebody wanted to communicate with Ted  So they actually take string and tie it to combs and then wing it out  under their door and then another guy will take a string with a comb and  Hook the other guy's comb and then wheel it in and they could get messages back and forth 
[12:30]
 So Ted Koppel is making it like it's very important. He gets this guy's message  So he's trying to fish and it's probably took him like an hour two hours to get this and get the message in  Yeah, editing so he could get the message and then five minutes later  He's with the camera talking to the guy so I read in your message  Do you really think I'm cute  Sorry, just saying that cuz I'm famous now. I'm taking a shower 
[13:00]
 The final indignity of prison the flesh of shank  I  Guess so cuz I I didn't go for the dump button. Yeah, it's so it's out there now  That's all right, but so you want the inmates to write you some letters. Absolutely. Yeah, just you know what they do day to day  Hobbies, okay  All right, Jesus, right, you know where they buried their last victim man 
[13:30]
 Yeah, sure. You know what though we did get we actually got a box of  prison-made weapons  Really? We're gonna shoot and put in the magazine. It's amazing pretty inventive  Yeah, enormously inventive. I mean they take a knife and they sharpen it  What's the sickest weapon you saw and how do they make it no it wasn't I can't remember how it was made  But I there was actually this phenomenal crack pipe  Out of like, I don't know toilet paper and toothpicks or something. Yeah, somebody's not or whatever. It was just like all put together 
[14:00]
 All this energy expended it was great. It was great. Oh Clint Eastwood in the movie got out of Alcatraz  But this guy's making crack pies, right? Yeah, and and there's still souvenir drinking birds that like keep talking  They make those but they brought the box into the step into the office at maximum  I swear to God everybody dropped what they're doing. We're all going through this thing. Like it's Christmas. It was amazing  Awesome running around the office and stuff. I could tell you how you to make one prison weapon 
[14:30]
 All right  I learned I learned about this from a con actually you take a fiberglass filter from a cigarette  And you burn it until it melts you put it on a tile floor and you  Stomp on it like with a boot heel and it gets really hard and you could sharpen it like a razor blade  Yeah, it flattens out gets hard because it's fiberglass and then you could sharpen it make like a razor like killer squirrels  Yeah, you could like kill any squirrels in the yard  It works like a box cutter for slashing, you know, there's a squealer you want to give them the market a squealer 
[15:00]
 Sure, you're lousy screw all these squirrels they do my bidding  7wnew the rock of New York to for Tuesday with lonesome George thorough good. I drink alone and bad to the bone  It's opi. It's Anthony. It's Mark. Gollin from Max of magazine  Look who stopped in opi and that's your in I believe Anthony my aunt Fran and and cherry hi guys from Cali  You got new boobs you got new boobs, let me say I didn't even know this. Oh 
[15:30]
 Yeah, oh yeah, you used to be very flat-chested well you got how long ago did you get those  Seven years old how many is that in boob years?  Staring at your ass friend boobs. All right. It's not like I'm staring my aunt's boobs  I  Thought she was so boring yesterday 
[16:00]
 Have your relatives come in and talk about their boobs  Yeah, by the way, if someone's close to the any W studios mark needs beers  See me and Anthony aren't allowed to drink beers while we're on the air. So, you know, wink wink mark needs the beer  Yeah, that's true. What does mark need two cases?  Mark needs about two cases. Yeah  We need a beer ball  Yes, I'll just sit and drink my Odell  Yeah, sure 
[16:30]
 You know market has a new fun game that everyone can play at home  What is it you go through the the papers the New York papers and you count how many pictures of?  Monica with her mouth open there are that's the that's the the shot to get in the paper because all of them are you know?  Here's Monica having a throat exam  That's on depressor here's Monica wearing her beret on her tongue  My aunt friends got a great a little take on Monica  You don't think any guy would even want to date her. No, she kisses and tells why would you want to do that? 
[17:00]
 It's a good point. That's true. Do we want to work with the word kiss here?  I think she's low. She's low life. She's yeah  I agree though because not only does she kiss and tell she kisses and Jots down everything. Yeah  And  Way too many things she's probably got a jar full of Kleenex  This is why when kids go to school the words dry cleaning should be 
[17:30]
 My god she just saves it  Disgusting woman and you guys do your Monica Maryland comparison  Well, yeah  We were also discussing the fact that you know  My aunt friend even said JFK did it a lot of the old presidents did it  We all know Taft was a wild man in office. Yeah, I couldn't be sober and have that mustache  Everyone knows he was a madman, but Kennedy I think what you said it was his taste in women that that yeah exactly  I think you know nobody got down on Kennedy because well, he has fine taste in women you know yourself 
[18:00]
 president private jet limo  Big house helicopter Marines following you around and stuff. He should be able to do better  Yeah, and he's got Marilyn Monroe Marilyn Monroe and this is what he got  Take a leaf blower to get the dress up  Remember that nice Marilyn Monroe shot where she's over the grating and a little little gust of wind  Monica you have to you know fire it up 
[18:30]
 You can lift a mummer skirt easier  Somehow I don't believe that I never tried to lift the mummers here  Yeah, she did actually she lifted our first little encounter with Clinton 
[19:00]
 She lifted the back of her jacket up to show she was wearing a  Sorry like she's a little innocent  But you know they break all these women they really they get on the old poor Monica she was young she didn't know what  She was doing what she was doing. She was trying to nail a president  She had a site set way higher I feel like I'm at my Thanksgiving table  Only picture that with ten more people that sound exactly the same 
[19:30]
 Yelling over each other it's amazing  One thing about the thong though with Monica that was misreported. It wasn't a thong  It was old woman bloomers, but over that fat ass it looked like a thong it was stretched to the breaking point  You're with a real tragedy here though is I gotta say it's uh, you know  I'm Jewish Monica Lewinsky's Jewish my mom her big thing  She would get together on Wednesday nights with her Jewish friends and play Mahjong and they'd all talk about you know 
[20:00]
 So what's your son doing? What's your daughter doing? Monica's parents like well my daughter and everybody's like yeah.

Everyone knows lamb chop is a girl  Little controversy there little controversy lamb chop was actually a guy  We'll get him on the phone in a little while to prove it. Okay lamb chop was a guy  It was a Sherry Lewis. Yeah, I spoke to lamb chop about this 
[29:30]
 Lamb chop is very upset  Sherry Lewis dressed up a guy as the little lamb chop  Yeah, but the she put the cute little bow in his hair right and shoved her fist with a no China  That's why he's a better man. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, your our doc puppet. You got nothing if you don't got your dignity  Exactly and now it seems that this bitterness is coming out when we speak with a lamb chop, right?  So I guess we could finally start talking about max of magazine with mark. Oh, yeah, that's why you're here 
[30:00]
 It's the Halloween issue actually and it's really good. I've been a little dark, huh? It's cool dark  There's lots of death and just remember. Yeah, it's really funny actually because the owner of the company who's over in the UK  Because I think in June I had an article called fun things to do after you die  And then I had like four or five other death articles and so on  He finally like called the other day after he got this issue and said are we done with the death? 
[30:30]
 And I said, of course we are it's a new it's it's 1999 now. It's gonna be the Antichrist  Sounds like you got the same boss as me and Anthony. Are you guys done?  You're done with this are you guys sure with the naked skank whore that recites poetry. Can we move on move on please?  But one of my favorite parts of the magazine this month October the world's deadliest things  This is fun things that are deadly. This is chipper  chipper it's  This makes me giddy like a schoolgirl. I was surprised at the one thing like animals 
[31:00]
 People that are killed by animals every year. Mm-hmm  And what animal causes the most human deaths out of any animal? Oh, I was very surprised. Wait, wait, I got an idea  We got some tickets to the Google dolls. Yeah taping. I'll wait but if they have the magazine that screw it  I do I mean, yeah, that means they did their homework. That's right. Throw the question out there  What's the animal that causes the most human deaths every year?  Okay, if you know the answer will will send it to the Google dolls 2 1 2 7 5 7 1 0 2 7 
[31:30]
 But quickly mark get back to the world or if you can guess how many erasers I have in my pocket  Let's get back to the world's deadliest things  Well, what do you want to know we got everything here we got world's deadliest sex act what is the world's deadly  Oh, that's the thing that Michael Hutchins. Yeah, I know asphyxia. What is it called?  Auto-aerotic system. Oh auto is something  Really long it's called sex with an automobile. I'm very dangerous. You say it you're dead 
[32:00]
 Claims between five hundred and one thousand lives a year  Now this is that whole thing where you choke off your air supply as you orgasm, right?  You just gotta remember let it off or you're done. Yeah, the release thing. That's great. Yeah, you go up to the pearly gates  Just like that  Hey, do you want to let me in I think not  Interesting see we got how we got the world's deadliest fist.

 It all depends  Formerly belonging to lamb chopper  But yeah this guy during  1950s  Mas Oh Yama who killed 47 bulls by punching them  Punched him. He just walked up and punched them and killed them and killed them like blazing saddles  Yeah  Like I always think about like this guy when he go to a bar, right?

[33:30]
 The infamous castle and I can't pronounce his word  CSEJ T. He and then we have a real helpful pronounced CAS  She should have committed those crimes in the Dominican Republic that's right where they build the prisons out of straw  Right, and you could just dig out the way for a hurricane and blows the building down you run away  You run away legend holds that to keep her skin beautiful. She took long luxurious baths in the blood of virgins 
[34:00]

Mm-hmm  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York to for Tuesday with Aerosmith. It's Opie  It's Anthony and it's mark from Max of magazine the editor-in-chief 
[35:00]
 We're having a real good time today and we're having so much fun. We didn't explain our little trivia question a little while ago  Joe picked up on it though. He faxed how is a deer deadly you moron  Of course Max and magazine has an eloquent protest. Yeah. Yeah  He's right. We didn't we are moron  Max and magazine has the world's deadliest things in it this issue. It's great  I like weapons systems appliance the world's deadliest appliance 
[35:30]
 Hairdryers, is that it hair dryers? Oh halogen lamps. Oh, yeah  We had one in it the other studio we were in before we got fired  Fight fight and it was one of those stand-up and it'll be it  It was one of those stand-up lamps that have an exposed halogen lamp on top of it  It might as well just be a torch like an old cave torch  That's not bad enough  Opie would sit and throw rolled up pieces of paper in it over Anthony's head over my head 
[36:00]
 The lamp was behind him and I would sit there and and pick him out and go knock it off cut it out  It was exactly like the episode of Bugs Bunny  Yeah, we go 70 Sam where bugs would throw the matches in the powder room of the ship. Oh  Yeah, varmint. You do that one more time. I'm not going out ain't a going in a story  What's funny about it I would just throw the paper and wait to see how long it takes 
[36:30]
 That's my second favorite Yosemite Sam one  My favorite one is where he's trying to cook them and he keeps running back to the ship for one match at a time  Miss me again you've been flapping blounder  But it I would throw the paper and I would wait to see how long it would take you to take the paper out 
[37:00]
 So and I did get to the point where I would go I am NOT getting and I swear to you this time  I am NOT getting it and what happened?  I thought it started on fire. I see from the fire  Exploded the bulb. Yeah, and I said think you're happy now  We have no light and then we got paranoid because they had that sprinkler system at this old  Yeah, where it just sucks out the air if there's a fire  Right like the Andromeda strain. I don't know what happens if you breathe in how long gas you your blood turns to powder 
[37:30]
 I didn't want to chance it so I kept retrieving the paper. All right, so world's deadliest things  Yes, and we put out the question the deadliest animal in America. Mm-hmm  It's a responsible for the most deaths per year  Yeah of humans now the answer was deer but we did explain why the deer is the most deadliest animal in America  Yeah, people thought, you know shark grizzly bear rattles a sure white-tailed deer  Kill an average of 130 people every year. Most of these encounters are deer and auto collisions 
[38:00]
 They jump out take one for the team. Yeah, who's the moron now?  That's great. I mean it must be like  Like when you know, you do something for Allah you strap a bomb to your body  Yeah, cuz you know the deer probably have this guy, you know, you'll go  Run in front of the car and kill the infidel  They jump in front of him got another one your Detroit Bambi is a martyr 
[38:30]
 Oh  We're having a lot of fun mark needs beer by the way known as brought mark beer  Mark had a couple of beers before he came in  Yeah was saying mm-hmm if you know how beer works kids a couple wears off  Yeah, and we don't know what's gonna happen to him. He might turn into a blithering idiot  No, if he gets sober tonight and mark  And mark likes to drink a lot of beer and you see me and Anthony  We're not allowed to drink beer while we're on the air. So mark needs about two cases that's right  Yeah, obviously we wouldn't partake but bring him plenty 
[39:00]
 Yes, oh and a six of Odell's. Yes, I'll drink a dual duals light  You know, so I feel like I'm drinking  Cuz I really just like the taste of beer without the wastedness that it gives me. Just admit it  You like going to the bathroom  Why don't they come up with a non-alcoholic scotch?  Taste like rubbing alcohol, but it doesn't get you buzzed. That's what I drink for to stay straight  But you still wake up feeling like crap 
[39:30]
 What else is in Max and magazine we gotta start talking about this thing finally all the office game is awesome explain that mark  Ah the office game. Well  We're sitting around we wanted to have some kind of a game  we wanted we you know, we'd like to bring joy and light into people's lives and  At first we were thinking about a drinking game, but it was going to be one of these things where  You'd really regret playing it because you know instead of just like drinking a shot  You had to drink your shot and have your name legally changed 
[40:00]
 Commitment to the game. Yeah lose your wife  Turn over your house or you have to wear adult diapers for the rest of your life or something  And then we thought well a drinking game is just plain childish. Sure. So instead we decided to an office game and  Basically the deal here is you get together with four or five of your friends at work and you all plunk down 20 or 40  bucks and then  You play this game  we give you a whole bunch of little pranks to do one point pranks three point and five point pranks and 
[40:30]
 The person that racks up the most number of points at the end of the day wins the pot  Just to give you a fast idea some of the pranks one pointers  Grown out loud while in a bathroom stall  At least one other person must be in the men's room and then you must follow with geez that burns  Wait a minute. I think someone in this building play that game  I don't understand that guy in the bathroom though. Oh the guy that's not no shame the not shy guy the not shy guy always 
[41:00]
 Oh, hey, how you doing today? Oh  You want to hand over some paper seem to be out over here boy, I'm going through half a roll how you doing  Just bring it on in the doors open  Come on, let me show you pictures of my family. Yeah, what a snort got a hip flask here  I need the thousand foot radius of nobody around me in the public bathroom 
[41:30]
 You sneak in you sit there and wait and wait wait until it's completely empty  You start your business and then if you hear the squeaky hinge, oh, there's someone in here  Close up like a bank vault. I'm done. Yeah, right. Well, it's embarrassing and then you're reaching around for the glaze  Wow  Smells like Oregon guys minty fresh. All right, what's some of the other example for the office game? 
[42:00]
 Let's see ignore the first five people who say hello to you in the morning. That's one point. That's good phone a co-worker  You barely know and leave this voicemail message just called to say that I can't talk right now. Bye  Put ketchup mustard or Vaseline on the men's room doorknob and  I was telling you guys reminds me of something we did  When we were in high school, we used to go to like a porn palace. No, no. Yeah. Damn. Oh, yeah  Changes my image of you. Okay 
[42:30]
 Wilmington Delaware, there's not much to do the opera comes to town so seldomly  And  So we go to this porn place and we go into one of the booths and then on the inside doorknob  We paint it with mayonnaise  Oh, we do this like five or ten of the booths and then like walk out and we just stand there and wait guys  Would walk in there they do whatever they're doing in there and so on then they reach for the doorknob and you hear them go  And then they realize like they can't get out because they're not gonna use the doorknob  You have these men with their pants around their ankles like banging at the door for somebody to let them out 
[43:00]
 Come on, how'd you learn that you were the mayonnaise guy?  Okay  Great trick guys, so someone told me  We used to go to the point out place in a Bayshore with a bunch of my pals after work  This is pre videotape taste. Yeah now your damn kids have it easy your gore comfort of your own home  Yeah, the internet. Hey, don't we didn't have no internet and we used to go to Bayshore and you know, there's little 
[43:30]
 Bottles of ivory liquid  You snake you sneak one of those in and  One of the climactic parts of the movie you just kind of squeeze the bottle and wing your arm around  Rays out into the first ten rows in front of you  an added feature you could go 
[44:00]
 You know what I don't care who's on network television as long as it's not Bonnie Franklin  Hate that woman. I hate everything about her one day at a time, right?  That was a good one Schneider. Oh, yeah. What a great character. What a tough guy he was  It was always funny every time he came through the door. Oh just screaming with laughter  Can you feel a little sarcasm?  One of those shows that I wish like everybody afterwards like went to prison 
[44:30]
 Like what was it?  Instead of different strokes  What happened to that show? He had a great thing on that. They had a bio of all the kids  Oh on different strokes on E  Yeah, yeah, it's one of those cruel Hollywood stories. Oh, they were on top but now they're on the bottom and we're gonna show you everything  Right, but then at the end of it, but then at the end of it, they're gonna show you everything  We're gonna show you everything right? But then at the end of it, but things are looking up. Yeah 
[45:00]
 Gary Coleman still looking up at everybody. That's the only thing looking up  Like all on a couch heavily medicated like laughing into the camera Dana Plato was adorable  When you know that's always on the hell happy you kid that show I mean on the East show  Dana she couldn't even be cast as a crack whore these days  They need too much makeup to make her look better  Terrible tightest pair of jeans on television when she was on that show. Oh la la soon. Yes. Yeah, may I say yeah 
[45:30]
 She needs to be on roller skates  Roller skating episode of chips  You missed the roller disco episode of chimney and Anthony it came on once and we actually called each other just so we could laugh  Openly and discuss the show as it was happening chips was doing a charity at a roller disco  Yeah, and they had celebrities that just happened to be on the same network as chips was and they had an announcer bringing everybody out 
[46:00]

Yeah boogie and down  Boogie in that whole episode even the crooks were on roller skates  Yeah for some reason everything had to have roller skates in it  There's a roller skating thing so the bank robbers had this clever ploy  They had big shoes and they rocked the bank and then would like hit a button on their heel and the roller skates would pop 
[47:00]
 Out of the shoes and they'd make their getaway  Like if they came into the bank on skates that were just skate the security guy go hmm. Wait a minute  I'm so dangerous. He's wearing skates. He might be robbing us  But the big bulky shoes hiding the skate wheels didn't look suspicious and of course  This is all before cars were invented. Yeah getaway skate getaway getaway a lot easier. All right, very nice  Sorry, sorry for out there for just reflecting on my youth 
[47:30]
