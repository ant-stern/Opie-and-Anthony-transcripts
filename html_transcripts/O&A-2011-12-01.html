<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts repeatedly shouting "O&A Show" before launching into a discussion about a deleted parody Twitter account impersonating their SiriusXM boss, Scott Greenstein.  The account, which they vehemently denied creating, used inside jokes like the office's supply of warm Hawaiian Punch, leading them to speculate a disgruntled former employee was responsible.  The conversation then shifted to a scathing review of a televised Christmas tree lighting ceremony.  They relentlessly mocked the singing performances of Carole King, Michael Bubl√© (whose popularity with women they found baffling), Justin Bieber (whose attire and performance of "Little Drummer Boy" were particularly targeted for criticism, focusing on his perceived lack of talent and heavy use of auto-tune), Neil Diamond (whose large ears were noted), and Tony Bennett. Al Roker's presence was also mentioned.  A caller chimed in about their daughter's waning interest in Bieber's music.  This led to a discussion on appealing to the teen girl market, with a hypothetical album by a crew member, "Sexy E-Rock," being humorously elaborated upon, complete with descriptions of his appearance and nicknames. CeeLo Green's remarkably white teeth were also mentioned.  A listener's suggestion to check out a death metal version of "Little Drummer Boy" on YouTube concluded this segment, followed by further comments on the Rockettes' performance and the cold weather at the Christmas tree lighting, along with anecdotes about past show experiences.  They briefly mentioned that Dane Cook would be a guest later.

The show continued with a discussion of rumors surrounding Jason Ellis, including speculation about a tattoo of his ex-wife's initials and a teardrop tattoo.  This segued into a recap of a previous show featuring Louie C.K. and Bobby Kelly, highlighting a particularly funny anecdote from their appearance.  A bizarre segment followed involving a listener nicknamed "Stalker Patty," who, after ingesting an unknown substance, experienced hallucinations, including the belief that one of the hosts had his penis exposed.  A short, awkward interview with comedian James Norton followed.  A humorous story about Sam Roberts mistakenly calling John Walsh by the name of his murdered son, Adam Walsh, was recounted. The NFL's fining of Buffalo Bills player Stevie Johnson for his touchdown celebration sparked a discussion on sportsmanship and celebrations in professional sports.  A phone call with Jay Oakerson ensued, where he shared his feelings about Patrice O'Neal's death and recounted anecdotes about O'Neal's comedic style and personality.  They discussed Dane Cook's reaction to O'Neal's death and his video game habits.  A segment featuring the recurring character "Uncle Paul" was played, followed by Jason Ellis' new song and a discussion of his recent rehab stint and the reasons behind it.

Jason Ellis then joined the show for a lengthy interview, discussing his struggles with sex addiction, rehab, and the subsequent breakdown of his marriage. He detailed his infidelity and attributed his actions to childhood trauma, specifically molestation by a neighbor, a revelation he only had after a drug experience at 17. He spoke frankly about his career, his relationship with SiriusXM, and his new TV show with Bam Margera and Tony Hawk. The conversation was punctuated by vulgar language and frank discussions of sex, drugs, and his personal struggles. His father's negative influence and his reconciliation with past issues were also discussed.  A significant portion focused on his recovery, therapy, 12-step programs, and his efforts to maintain sobriety. Jonathan, Ellis's manager, briefly appeared, sharing stories of his travels to exotic and dangerous locations. Dane Cook's presence outside the studio was mentioned.  They discussed Ellis's new music, including a fan-written song, and his ambitious goal of surpassing Nickelback and Rod Stewart in popularity.  The conversation ended with more joking banter about finances and possessions.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to a tribute to the late comedian Patrice O'Neal, with Dane Cook as a guest. They shared numerous anecdotes about O'Neal, his personality, career, and their relationships with him, often using explicit language. They recounted funny moments from his stand-up, including instances where reporters mistakenly identified him as 14 years old and his memorable confrontation with Gallagher. They touched upon his health issues and romantic relationships, including his relationship with Vaughn. Dane Cook detailed their friendship, including a shared experience of simultaneously breaking up with their girlfriends.  A tangent about Dane Cook's new movie, "Answers to Nothing," and its plot points (including cheating, child molestation, and alcoholism) followed. The discussion included a posthumous release of O'Neal's stand-up album, "Mr. P," and plans to ensure his family received the proceeds.  A significant amount of time was also spent discussing Dane Cook's Call of Duty gameplay, particularly his use of knives and strategic approaches.

The tribute to Patrice O'Neal continued, with more anecdotes about his blunt honesty, his difficulty hiding dislike for people, his habit of shushing crowds, and his unusual travel habits (carrying glass dildos in a briefcase).  Dane Cook again promoted his movie, *Answers to Nothing*. A new track, "I Hate People Touching Me," from O'Neal's posthumously released album, *Mr. P*, was played.  Listener calls were incorporated, along with discussions of O'Neal's Comedy Central special, *Elephant in the Room*, and a planned all-Patrice O'Neal programming weekend.  The Gallagher confrontation, where O'Neal accused Gallagher of racism, was detailed.  The show concluded with Sam Roberts discussing his financial situation and jokingly demanding a raise, with repeated mentions of the show's sponsors, Trojan Bearskin Condoms.

I just want to go on the record  and say I don't know anything about it.  No?  I didn't do shit.  It's definitely gone?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because I wouldn't be surprised  if they're pointing their fingers at us.  They are. 
[00:05:00]  Officially, they are?  I don't know if they are.  A lot of people.  A lot of people?  Is it definitely gone?  I'm 99% sure it's gone.  I think I'm somebody,  and you've got to think it's an inside job,  started a Scott Greenstein Twitter feed.  Yeah.  And I really don't know if the guy has a sense of humor.  I have no idea.  I've never had a quality conversation with the man.  But it was hilarious. 
[00:05:30]  The fake Scott Greenstein Twitter account was hilarious.  Is he mad or understanding that it's just a joke?  There were rumors that there was time spent yesterday  trying to get it taken down.  Oh, really?  I mean, I don't know for a fact.  I didn't even know it existed.  I would have liked to have.  People around here did  because there was accusations being flung.  Toward us?  Around everybody yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  I'm going on record.  I have nothing to do with it.  And as I know,  I don't think anyone from the show has anything to do with it.  I would bet money no one from the show has anything to do with it.  Was it derogatory or was it silly?  It was silly.  It was goofy.  It was pretty damn funny.  I was going to bring it to everyone's attention yesterday,  but then, you know.  Was it obvious it wasn't him?  Because that's like a big thing.  If it's just such a parody and a goof,  it's kind of silly.  Yeah, it was a definite parody. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was a big-time parody.  Yeah.  And now it's been taken down?  I believe so.  I can't remember specific tweets at this time.  But I don't know.  What were some of them?  Vagueness?  We're saying it's not vague.  We're saying there was a fake.  How was it vague?  There was a fake Twitter account.  The guy that runs programming here at SiriusXM  had a fake Twitter account  and it seemed like it was an inside job.  This is something that has been going on  in a lot of companies lately.  Dummies. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  They get these fake kind of Twitter accounts  for the big boss  and just beat the shit out of them.  But then IP addresses get checked.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be easy to get someone doing this shit.  Of course.  It's a stupid thing to do.  I got very nervous.  I was caught in the crosshairs.  I'm clean on this one, Sam.  I didn't do shit.  I got tweeted at by the account.  I think that's why people think that...  Oh, so did I.  Okay.  Yeah, that's the only reason I know about it.  And then I started howling  and then I wanted to tell these guys about it  and then, you know,  unfortunately the whole Patrice thing went down.  So, I don't know. 
[00:07:30]  There was a tweet about him just outside  staring at a Christmas tree  going, maybe I should go in  and do some work now.  Oh, no.  I've been out here for hours  staring at this Christmas tree.  But it was really specific.  Like, if it wasn't somebody who works here,  somebody who works here  was telling a person what to write.  You know what?  It was funny.  Whoever did it, it was funny.  Liam was blaming E-Rock.  I don't think it was E-Rock.  Nah, too clever for E-Rock.  Ouch. 
[00:08:00]  Sorry, E-Rock.  Is E-Rock...  E-Rock's not like that, though, is he?  No.  E-Rock's not that kind of guy.  Clever?  No, but he's not...  But he's more of a lumbering Fred Gwynn.  But E-Rock's not...  It beats a fat joke.  It does beat a fat joke,  although it was heavy.  That's how you walk through the door.  But he's not the septum...  No, I would bet money  at someone that used to work here  that's, you know,  still holding some kind of a grudge or whatever.  That could definitely be.  I would bet money.  Because you'd be crazy to, you know,  start that up if you still work here. 
[00:08:30]  Because the info, I guess,  I've been told is pretty specific  and only an insider would know that shit.  Yeah.  Like Hawaiian Punch being warm or something?  Yeah, there was, like,  complaints about warm Hawaiian Punch.  What?  Which is one of the drinks  we have in the fridge in the kitchen.  Oh, wow.  Okay, that's very specific.  I thought it was a Christmas party.  Is that his go-to drink?  I have no idea.  That's very specific.  Yeah, I don't know anything about the man.  But the fact that Hawaiian Punch was mentioned  and it's not like shows here on the platform  spend a great deal of time  talking about the fact  that there's Hawaiian Punch in our kitchen 
[00:09:00]  means that it's probably someone  who's been in our kitchen.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It's just not worth the risk.  We're not being vague.  We're not being vague.  No, I know.  This is a way to attack bosses.  People set up fake Twitter accounts  and then the whole office starts howling.  I literally haven't heard of it  until you mentioned it.  I know.  I wish I would have seen it.  All us low-tier people  were all buzzing about it yesterday.  Oh, you were all abuzz?  Trying to figure out who it was.  All alight?  I bet you all hell broke loose  as everyone had to stop doing  what they were doing  to make sure this was shut down. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know what upper management thinks,  but everybody on the lower tier of things  that I speak to  all thought it was somebody in the O&A camp.  I would bet one to two people were pissed off  and that's it.  That's the whole...  I would bet money on that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably the wrong one to two people, though.  Yeah, that's true.  And I think it's more one.  Yeah.  I'm just throwing maybe two.  So, I guess it's shut down  so we can't even read the tweets. 
[00:10:00]  No, unfortunately not.  I really want to know who it was.  People are blaming Roland.  No, no, no.  Yeah, Roland was brought up a few times,  but I said if it were Roland,  it would have been littered with spelling errors.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's so.  It's not Roland.  If it were anybody on our staff or our team,  everybody else on the staff would know about it  because we'd all be...  That's true.  Everybody would be in it together.  Yeah, yeah.  And, I mean, it's not.  Oh, well.  It's gone anyway, so.  Water under the bridge. 
[00:10:30]  So.  Yeah.  C'est la vie.  How's everyone doing?  All right.  Yeah.  I'm all aglow with the Christmas spirit  after watching the wonderful tree lighting  on NBC last night.  Wow.  God, I wanted a live...  Star-studded.  I wanted a live tweet last night,  but I was in no mood.  It was...  I couldn't resist.  I didn't even want to.  I was compelled to tweet a couple of times  and watch this disaster of boredom. 
[00:11:00]  Can I start by saying this?  Because I know where you're going with it.  Yeah.  With it.  Can we all acknowledge,  and this is going to be old school,  that Carole King can't sing anymore?  No.  Did you hear that?  Holy fuck.  Wow, was that awful.  She can't fucking sing.  No, that was terrible.  And she's a legend in the female singing category.  I think she needed some effects on that thing.  Well, they introduced Carole King to sing a dopey number,  and then there's another broad on stage  that they don't even introduce, 
[00:11:30]  so she could help her along with the song  and harmonize a little bit.  Helping her out, sangin'.  Who was that broad?  I don't know.  She had a major role in the song they sang.  She was terrible.  And then fucking...  Who else was...  That Michael Buble is like fucking Ambien.  Like Ambien.  He's a crooner.  Did you notice his...  Birds flying.  He didn't sing that.  Did you notice his leather suit was a bit tight?  His leather suit... 
[00:12:00]  Was a bit tight.  Was very tight.  And the reason it was tight  is because he's one of those skinny fat guys.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like he should have just got a bigger size suit.  And the crooning thing is so bad.  He was like,  Chestnuts.  Roasting.  Oh, the weather outside is frightful.  But fire is so delightful.  And since we've no place to go. 
[00:12:30]  I sure blow, I sure blow, I sure blow.  He was terrible.  But he lisps.  He lisps.  Brought some corn for poppin'.  A poppin'.  Is the corn a-poppin'?  This fucking stick is terrible.  My sister was over last night, Ant.  She loves him.  Yeah.  She loves him.  And that's when I sit there and go,  Wow, I just live in a completely different world than my sister.  She loves him?  She loves him. 
[00:13:00]  He's terrible.  Oh, Eric's family too.  The women in my family love him.  Women love this guy.  They go down to Atlantic City every time he's at the Borgata.  Does he sell out?  All the time.  Wow.  Know who else my sister loves?  She goes, I know he's a little pompous, but...  Harry Connick Jr.  Harry Connick Jr.  Harry Connick Jr. is to die for.  Another croon.  I hate the croon.  All the Nagle women throwing their panties off.  Oh, wow.  Their big panties.  The Nagle women are all soaking through their jeans. 
[00:13:30]  Their mom jeans are all wet.  That's terrible.  And Eric has to go with them, and he's just rolling his eyes the whole time.  Oh, like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  Why can't I be more like Michael Dupley?  Why do they love him?  I have no idea.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't get it.  They just go every time he's in the Laird.  Do you hate when they make you go to the show because you overhear them saying things like,  I'm creaming my jeans? 
[00:14:00]  Creaming.  Would they try to hijack the Prince Dupley seed?  I'm sure they would.  They say really vulgar things.  They don't realize Eric can hear them.  In their mouths.  In their mom jeans.  I'd let them come in my mouth with you.  Eric's going to pretend he didn't hear it.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God.  He didn't get turned on by it.  You know, like Michael Dupley.  Michael Dupley was so boring. 
[00:14:30]  Isn't he coming in here?  Yeah, Roland said he might be coming in to promote a book.  Oh, great.  He's approved.  And then we have to talk to him.  Michael Dupley.  He's not going to sing?  That's our luck.  We get Michael Dupley, and he's going to fucking promote a book instead of sing a dumb song.  You want to see me fall asleep on the air again?  Get him in here to croon.  Why not?  Oh, he's terrible.  He was singing Christmas songs, and what it amounted to, that whole tree lighting thing,  is a big commercial for what's coming up on NBC. 
[00:15:00]  Because he's doing a Buble Christmas, by the way.  And everybody performing has Christmas albums out.  Yes, they all have Christmas albums out, and fucking giant lima bean head fucking Al  Roker is just interviewing him, and it's all plugs.  They're all just doing plugs for fucking their album.  It was his bit.  That's his bit.  It was so bad.  Al Roker.  That's his show.  It's the only one, I think, that actually just should have stayed fat. 
[00:15:30]  Just stay fat.  Some people just should stay fat.  It looks so, his head is like a big, like, I hate to say Easter Island head, because it's  so used all the time, but it does.  It's shaped like that.  It's a giant, big, long bean head.  How about Justin Bieber?  Oh, Jimmy, what are you doing skipping ahead?  Oh, what are you doing?  I didn't see it.  Yes.  This is where this whole thing's head off.  You don't want to talk about Neil Diamond's giant ears first? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, is he there?  Holy shit.  This is something about when people get old.  Those ears of his were retarded.  I thought he was wearing headphones.  Oh.  His ears are giant.  Like, the lobe goes down as low as the upper part is high on his ear.  Can you just, you know, kind of trim that up?  Trim it up?  You probably could.  Doctors should figure that shit out, because guys and gals are living a lot longer.  Let's figure out how to trim up the ears when you get older. 
[00:16:30]  Because that looks goofy.  Have they always been that big?  Or do you have hair covering?  No.  Your ears and your nose continue to grow your entire life.  So we're all going to look like that if we're lucky enough to...  And gravity just pulls down on your ear lobes.  Yeah.  Just that little bit of gravity every day just yanking on your lobes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have good lobes.  Let me think.  No, you're all right.  Oh, you're fine.  You have adorable little ears, Jimmy.  You're wonderful.  Other comedians have been teasing my ears for years. 
[00:17:00]  How, the ears for years?  Yes.  For a long time.  Ears for years.  Yeah.  That could be a good charity.  Black Mr. Potato Head for Al Roker.  Yeah, it's definitely...  George on Long Island.  Thank you, George.  It's odd looking.  And then, what's his name there?  Tony Bennett.  Tony Bennett.  I left my heart in San Francisco, Tony Bennett.  Crazy Tony Bennett, we found out.  Not on our show, but...  Unfortunately, no.  Yeah, that he's crazy.  He sang White Christmas to teenage girls.  Yeah.  Young teenage girls. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Who were there to see Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  And I definitely think they were enhancing the crowd noise.  They were enhancing the crowd noise.  Do we have the audience?  Like, woo!  Woo!  And it was...  They weren't doing that for Tony Bennett.  Dreaming of a White Christmas.  He shakes his head around.  Yeah, they don't give a fuck about Tony Bennett.  No!  They're there to see the Biebs.  Well, they might like him.  They were adorable.  He just did something with Lady Gaga.  Like, he's worked with enough young performers. 
[00:18:00]  He's a little hip right now.  Amy Winehouse.  Ah, those dopes don't understand him yet.  I don't think they get it.  They just see an old guy.  They were all there for Bieber.  Were they?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see Mariah Carey?  What kind of voodoo did they do to make her look hot?  Hey, stop it.  You see her with her hands up against the wall?  That's the wife of one of our good friends.  That's my homeboy's wife.  Yeah.  Watch what you say.  She's a fucking pig, Sam.  Oh, no!  That's my friend's wife.  Well, I didn't go to high school with her.  She might be a little younger than me. 
[00:18:30]  Damn!  We did go to the same high school, though.  Damn!  I guess she looked all right.  Yeah.  Just all right, though.  But they made her look like a fucking superstar.  She sang with the Biebs.  She did, did she?  That was the one that almost sounded normal.  Fucking.  Are you ready for the Biebs song?  I was.  Can we just play it?  Well, the whole thing with the Biebs, yeah.  I don't get the Biebs.  What?  Well, you're not supposed to, Opie.  It's a bunch of girls.  Yeah, but like when the Hanson Brothers hit, you got it, because they definitely had some 
[00:19:00]  kind of musical talent.  More braces than a polio ward.  It was all just brace-faced girls.  Is Justin Bieber talented?  No!  I don't think...  He's terrible!  He fucking...  Look, he can't sing, but see, if people are going to yell at us and go, you're just  40-year-old assholes.  You don't know what I am.  Oh, okay.  A child of the 80s.  But I am.  There's no secret there.  Of course. 
[00:19:30]  And so they're going to say you guys just don't know shit.  Yeah.  But, I mean...  No.  I could tell, even crooners who I hate, I could tell when they're good at crooning.  Know what he should never do?  Justin Bieber?  Breathe.  Well, if he wants longevity, he should never appear on a stage with Usher.  I'm not a big Usher fan.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Uh-huh.  But you could tell Usher is fucking talented.  Yeah.  And he comes out and just sings his ass off, and Bieber looks like an idiot. 
[00:20:00]  That's what happens.  Bieber winds up looking like a jackass.  When they sing together, you realize, holy fuck, this kid isn't as talented as his popularity  when Usher shows up.  Usher knows how to fucking sing and perform.  Wait a minute.  Are you saying that this teen idol is not as good a singer?  I know, but I don't, you know...  But there's such hype around him.  And he's entering that...  Wherever he goes, they look at him like he's godlike.  He's entering that overexposed period, too, where every time you turn around, they're 
[00:20:30]  throwing him on something else.  And his voice is changing.  He's in a strange spot.  We'll have to see what the next year brings.  He was wearing what I could only describe on Twitter as a Starfleet jacket.  It looked like he was from another planet.  That's going to be a horrible video, Sam.  You know that already.  And he sang this fucking Little Drummer Boy.  Yeah.  Oh, I heard about that.  I love that song.  Oh, well.  Stevie Wonder does a great version of Little Drummer Boy. 
[00:21:00]  You'll love this rendition.  Is it like this?  Oh, exactly.  Oh, you're going to love this, Jimmy.  It's beautiful.  It brings in the holiday spirit.  Is this better than Stevie's version?  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  Stevie who?  It's so bad.  Ready?  Yeah.  Please.  Ready?  Oh, well.  SFP Christmas.  Close.  Let's.  Can we.  Can we.  Oh, let's hear it, please.  Can we say anything beforehand or you want to just play it?  Yeah, just let people get into it.  What's Drummer Boy for a new generation?  It's Bieber.  Right. 
[00:21:30]  And honestly, when it first started.  Yeah.  I was like, all right.  All right.  Bieber's going to do one of the classics.  And I'm thinking he's doing okay with it.  Yeah.  To be fair.  Well, his singing is mediocre at best.  Mediocre at best.  But the people, once again, will say you guys don't know shit about this.  No.  I'm not talking about how he sounds.  You know, what girls like as far as Bieber goes.  I'm talking about technically singing.  You could tell if someone is hitting the notes. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  If they have a good range.  If they could carry the note for any length of time.  Technically, he's mediocre at best.  How do we tap into that market?  The teen girls.  With a time machine, maybe.  How do we tap into it?  I think we passed that.  I'll tap into teen girls.  How do we tap into that?  With my jizz tap.  Get it?  My tap.  That jizz comes out of.  The dick.  I'm not saying pick one off every once in a while. 
[00:22:30]  I mean tap in.  Tap in?  Because that'll give us two solid years.  Yeah.  Two amazing years where we can't even leave the fucking building.  How do we tap into this shit?  We gotta have Eric put out an album with those baby blue eyes he's got just blinking on the CD cover.  Doing that Paris Hilton face he does.  On his bedroom eyes.  Yeah.  If we get Eric to put out an album.  Eric has heavy eyelids.  Yeah.  You got very heavy eyelids.  He's got a come-hither stare.  He's got like a long hither.  He's got thick eyelids. 
[00:23:00]  I have very lovely eyelashes.  I find that to be the case.  What would his name be?  What is his performance name?  Sexy.  Sexy.  Sexy E.  Justin Blubber.  E-Rock has had the most nicknames on this show, but I'm really enjoying just calling him sexy at this point.  Yeah.  Sexy.  You know what some people have been calling him?  What?  The Bags.  Not late for dinner.  The Bags.  The what?  The Bags. 
[00:23:30]  Like Sex Bagels.  Yeah.  Sex Bagels.  The Bags.  The Bags.  The Bags.  The Bags.  The Bags.  The cover would just be him like looking.  When you're looking down, but you're looking up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dreamy eyes.  Dreamy eyes.  Sexy Bags.  Sexy Bags.  Sexy Bags.  Oh.  Because this is the grand finale of our Lighting of the Christmas Tree fucking little bit we're doing here.  Sure.  What about CeeLo?  What the fuck is CeeLo?  I miss CeeLo.  You missed him?  Yeah.  He looked like he had a paper plate in his mouth. 
[00:24:00]  What?  How do you get your teeth that white?  Oh, yeah.  He's got the whitest teeth ever.  I'm going to guess they're, um, it was uncomfortable to look at how big and white they were.  Are they caps?  They have to be caps.  Because teeth whitening you can get to, it does a certain amount, but I don't know.  No.  His are big, too.  It almost looked like he was wearing, like, a mouthpiece.  Oh.  Like, it didn't even look like individual teeth.  Like a boxer just having that big fucking mouthpiece. 
[00:24:30]  You didn't see that?  No, I missed the CeeLo.  Yeah.  CeeLo.  Yeah, well, we can play the Bieber, then.  Yeah, let's see the video, too, Sam.  Am I supposed to enjoy this without seeing the video of Biebs?  Ugh.  Uh, wait a minute.  This is fucking broad.  Who the fuck are you?  Oh.  Oh, whatever.  I don't feel like doing bits. 
[00:25:00]  Who's this, CeeLo?  Motherfucking CeeLo?  No, this is, uh...  That's the Biebs.  Oh, so you want to just play it off that?  No, because it's a different song.  Yeah, yeah.  They haven't put the whole special at all on.  Oh.  Why would they?  There's albums to sell.  Exactly.  But I just wanted to give a visual of the jacket.  The fuck is with that thing?  Is he trying to look tough?  Yeah.  He's trying to toughen up his image a little bit.  He's looking cool.  He's not working.  Yeah, he is cool, right?  He's cool.  High fashion.  Yeah.  Got the hair all spiky.  See, Eric could pull off that hair. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Easy.  Yeah, he could.  With a little sun in.  We're going to tap into this market, I'm telling you, man.  They're fucking loyal.  Look at this shit.  They're loyal.  They don't even know what he's singing.  Yes, Jimmy.  I dreamt last night that I was at a Kiss concert, and they brought out Vanilla Ice.  What?  And I was there, but I was watching a video.  You're a children's dream.  And I hated it.  I'm like, why are they doing this?  They look like dorks.  And they were singing like whatever, you know, like Ice, Ice, baby.  And Kiss was singing it, and Vanilla Ice was on stage. 
[00:26:00]  And he kept waving at people in the audience who were screaming at him and heckling him.  Oh, my God.  You are the weirdest guy.  That was a terrible nightmare.  Terrible.  I just thought of that when I saw his hair, because that's how Vanilla Ice looked.  That is just the peebs.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  I hear an auto-tuner being here, too.  I heard that.  Can't slide it past me, motherfucker.  Yes!  Everybody put your hands up like this.  Oh, God.  Everybody put your hands up like this. 
[00:27:00]  I'll tell you why, and I know this much about fucking singing, right?  Yeah.  When you don't have confidence in your voice to just belt out a fucking song, you do all  this nonsense.  Yeah, nonsense.  Exactly.  And you end, you end it up a bit.  Yeah.  He's going to end it up a bit.  End it up.  Why not just sing the song?  And if you had a voice, you know, that's all you would need to do.  Baby Jesus would have hated this gift.  Right.  Would have hated this gift.  Wait till you hear this.  It sounds, his voice sounds weak.  It is.  He doesn't have a very strong, he can hold a thin line of a note. 
[00:27:30]  Very thin.  But he doesn't sound like he can really, and he did a Stevie Wonder thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's kind of what Stevie was doing in his song.  And Stevie's the fucking master.  Stevie's version's a little better.  Stevie's got an amazing voice.  A little better.  This guy's got nothing going for himself as far as singing.  And his dancing, you know, I'm not Mr. Fucking Dancer.  Much to the, what was that?  What do you say?  Much to some of your chagrin.  Yes.  Another chagrin. 
[00:28:00]  Or contrary to popular belief.  You were hoping we were going to say, no,  Oh, you're a terrific dancer.  No, I believe me.  You're the dancing queen.  I don't think I've ever danced in my life.  You stand there with a 50 cal, you move like the ocean.  I really do.  Like a swan.  But this guy just can't dance.  And when you get people around him that can dance and have some rhythm, black people.  Yes.  He just comes off looking silly.  He's cute when he was a kid.  That's the whole thing.  When he was a kid, it was like, wow, you got a kid that's doing these things. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  You know, and he's so talented.  But his talent never grew with himself.  So now he's older and it just doesn't work.  He's going to be finished by 20.  It's the worst thing.  He's going to be finished by maybe 20.  Your dream's coming true when you're 15 is you're finished.  You're done.  Who's coming up that's going to knock him off?  I mean, there's a lot of kids on YouTube.  I think a kid's got a break now on YouTube.  There's that Grayson Chance.  Oh, Grayson Chance. 
[00:29:00]  But he's like a kid that you already know is gay.  So that's not going to work.  Is he gay?  I mean, he's a little kid.  So I guess he's not yet.  He's on Ellen's show.  So he has to be.  Oh, so maybe he might lose some of the teen girl audience because they know.  What about Astro?  I don't know Astro.  Motherfucking Astro.  From X Factor?  Oh, X Factor.  Forget about X Factor.  Astro fucking trends every other day.  They love the Astro.  The guy who won The Voice and the guy who won X Factor just finished already. 
[00:29:30]  Here's Justin Bieber.  No confidence in the actual song.  So now it's time for nonsense.  As Jimmy said yesterday, jig it up.  Oh, yeah.  What did I say that for?  I listened to the replay yesterday.  We'll get into it a little later, I'm sure.  But God damn it, that was fucking funny.  Jimmy said, yeah, when you were talking about Spike Lee and Patrice and you were telling the story.  Oh, and Louie made fun of it.  Dave Attell actually made fun of the fact that you conveying the story had nothing, no soul or substance to it at all. 
[00:30:00]  And he said, what about I wasn't going to jig it up.  I fucking heard that on the replay.  I was dying.  Attell was, that's by the way, Attell, when he came in and said, come on people, we have a purple suit and giant coffin in the box.  Hilarious.  What a fucking funny motherfucker David Attell is.  I was telling a lot.  Come on, people.  God, it's how he delivered it.  Fucking brilliant, man.  We've got to replay that because I told a lot of people that could be the funniest line ever uttered. 
[00:30:30]  It was just fucking hysterical.  And everyone looked around the room like, holy fuck.  And then, you know, everyone started howling.  That's, it's the one thing I love about being, or being a comic or being around comics.  It's like, what a relief it is to be able to say something or hear something.  Oh, right?  That fucking funny.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, people.  Just that over the top.  Dave is really underrated lately.  Yes.  One of the fucking, the absolute greats. 
[00:31:00]  He is a great fucking comic.  Hilarious.  I hope he starts doing our show more.  We've been trying.  I think he's just like getting up in the morning.  Yeah.  We're trying.  I hope he starts doing it more.  He's not one of these fucking, you know, recovering comics.  Yeah.  He's still, he's still in the trenches.  No, no, no.  No.  No, he's healthy.  Oh.  He's healthy.  Smokes, but he's drinking or we're getting high or anything.  What's this world coming to?  He looks like a little, he reminds me of a weird little elf man now.  He's all thin and tender and small fingered.  He just kind of blows in like a Fiona Apple. 
[00:31:30]  Gentle Fiona Apple.  Well, here's the Biebs.  Yes, the Biebs.  Back to the Biebs.  And you're going to hear just a lot of fucking nonsense now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody put your ass off like this.  Ready?  Okay.  Let's go.  I'm down.  I'm down.  Let's stop.  Oh, stop it.  Woof, woof, woof, woof.  Yay.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus hates this.  Jesus hates this.  I like to be.  I'm a Joe.  Oh.  Let's go.  Little baby.  Farah-ba-bum-bum.  Yeah.  I'm a poor boy, too.  Farah-ba-bum-bum.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have no way to bring.  I have no way to bring. 
[00:32:30]  What a wigger.  Yeah.  I have no way to bring.  I have no way to bring.  I have no way to bring.  I have no way to bring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was about to get credibility because Busta Rhymes is about to fucking hit the stage.  Busta be coming out, motherfuckers.  Busta Rhymes.  Where's the motherfucker too, Sean?  Busta Rhymes?  Yeah.  Isn't this the guy that got arrested for beating somebody up?  What happened to you, Busta Rhymes?  Busta.  It shows you how like.  Busta.  Busta.  Yeah.  Busta.  Even rappers with street cred, the gangsters, these hardcore guys, they all want to make fucking 
[00:33:00]  mainstream money.  Yeah.  I would do it too.  I mean.  That's just funny to hear.  That's good to give the king  Bravo-pum-pum  Bravo-pum-pum  Bravo-pum-pum  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh! 
[00:33:30]  Oh, rhyme it with bigger  Oh, that ain't it  This is not the song I remember  I don't remember this either  When I was growing up in Centerport  And my dad would put the Christmas records on  This isn't even close to the David Bowie version  And Bing  Bravo-pum-pum  I'll beat my kids today 
[00:34:00]  Bravo-pum-pum-pum  That's my favorite version of the dumb song  Is it?  Yeah, man  I like Stevie's  Well, why don't we go to the old piano  And sing us a song about beating the kids  And punching the wife  And drinking whiskey  And having a cigarette breath  Drinking bourbon  Cigarette breath, yeah  Singing with cigarette breath  And yellow tea  You think that dumb sweater of Bing smelled?  Oh, God, yeah  Nicotine and what?  Child's tears 
[00:34:30]  You know how many times  White's blood?  A sad face in that sweater  While a spanking was commencing  As he was, like, missing  And hitting their little child legs  Because he was drunk  Oh  Yeah  White America's gone  It says, Scott 
[00:35:00]  I played my trunk for him  Bravo-pum-pum-pum  You hear the auto-tune in there?  I hear it  I played my last portion  Bravo-pum-pum-pum  Bravo-pum-pum  Bravo-pum-pum  Yeah  If you want to give  Is it coming here?  JV on my B?  Yeah, y'all want to say  Crazy as when people say  They say they don't care  When there's people  And it's even though  But it's not fair  It's about time for you  To act merrily  It's about time for you 
[00:35:30]  To get to charity  Merrily  To be brave  You want to help at all  Cause they want  Butterfly  Get a toy  Get a doll  Chicken has a memory  I'm hungry  I'm hungry  I'm cold  He's trying to sound  So black  It's like Jimmy  With a can-go hat  Leave him alone  Justin Bieber 
[00:36:00]  Thank you so much  For coming man  We lost you yesterday  Justin Bieber  Really?  Can you imagine  Him knowing five years ago  He'd be yelling that  Into a microphone  Justin Bieber  I don't like Buster Rhymes  Cause he was a dick to me  When I met him  So I don't like him at all  So I'm glad to see this 
[00:36:30]  Even though he's succeeding  I'm glad to see you yelling  And playing backup  To this sissy boy  Sissy boy  You're a real gangster  He's a tough guy  And he's playing backup  Are we just too old  To get this shit?  No  Sometimes I have to ask myself that  No  Cause I could  You know  I could see something  And realize  Wow there's some talent there  Even if I don't get it  But you know  Usher comes out  And sings his ass off  Makes Bieber look like an idiot  Bieber doesn't know how to rap  Like Buster Rhymes does 
[00:37:00]  But Buster Rhymes comes out  And raps  So I guess  I guess Buster's doing  A great job with that  And then you go back  To a weaker version of rap  With Justin Bieber  With that thin voice  And him trying to fucking sound black  Putting black  Like that inflection  That little lisp  On the end of the voices  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  But it's just  He's a teenager  That's what teenagers do  Like you try to find  Yeah it's just  It'll  It'll  Believe  By the time he's 21  He won't be doing that  It's just this little phase  He's going through  And it's 20  He won't be doing anything 
[00:37:30]  He's not going to be doing anything  At 21  He's going to be on VH1  Doing one of those fucking clip shows  The Hanson brothers were massive  When we were in Boston  Hockey  Exactly  He's got  I'm telling you  He's got YouTube  And social networking  I think is going to keep  People bigger longer  Yeah  Yeah I really do  Because  He's had the fame  Long enough  And big enough  To where he won't  Completely go away  No he won't  But  It's  He's one  YouTube kid away  From fucking  And also 
[00:38:00]  Not getting this  Adulation  You're right about  People now are realizing  Of course I am  What he sounds like  When he sings  Yeah  Because before  You just knew  Who he was  Most people  Who were grown  Didn't even know  Had never heard  A Justin Bieber song  Right  Now that they're  Shoving him  In our faces  Everywhere  People are actually  Hearing him sing  And going  My parents said  The same thing  On Thanksgiving  They were like  Our Sam is better  I heard that just  Did Mother  Criticize him  Because he wasn't Sam  Oh Sam  I'm going to break  These JB cookies

[00:39:00]  Of any cookies  I don't get the beeps  At all  No no  I just get the fact  That he can sing  Live especially  It's just terrible  And the problem  With tapping into  That 14 year old market  Is they're fickle  As all hell  Oh  They will fucking  Leave you  High and dry  Yeah  Once Sexy Beggs comes out  Forget about Bieber  He's the next  On to the next thing  Can I hear this thing  I'm dreaming of  White chocolate  The other one  You were talking about  You said it's on  It's on it's way up  Oh Grayson whatever

[00:41:00]  How his voice is  Developing  Which means his voice  Is changing  Yes  Which means his 15 minutes  Are at 14 and counting  Happy birthday  Jimmy  Punching out  Wait but your daughter  Doesn't like him anymore  He was  Your call was a waste  If you're still listening  Your call was a waste  Worst calls ever  You didn't say anything  No  The setup was  The only reason  I went to the call  Was that  His daughter  Used to like Justin Bieber  Doesn't like him anymore  Because his voice  Is changing  But he didn't say 
[00:41:30]  Any of that  Yeah  Justin says  His voice is getting better  Oh really  Well let's see  What his fans say  He's panicking  Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit  He's totally fucking panicking  See what his fans say  I don't think that's  Getting better  If he was so great  Why did Usher come out  And then just  Fucking sing with him yesterday  Yeah  I mean I know  They sing together  But  But he's at the point  Where he should be like  Okay  Just doing his own thing  And maybe  Usher brought him in  And now  Okay now go off  And do your thing  Yeah but every  Fucking time he's out there  There's gotta be an Usher

[00:46:00]  They pay all the retarded brothers  To stay out of the limelight  Fucking  Damn Iraq  That's a good point  I'm dreaming of a thin brother  I'm not supposed to say that out loud ever  That's funny  Alright  So the Christmas fucking lighting  Yeah that was the lighting  And of course it's that whole  Dild up to nothing  They flip a switch  And everybody goes  Woo  Half a million people showed up  Half a million people  Were down streets  That you can't even see the tree  That's what I was saying 
[00:46:30]  To my sister  We were kind of watching it together  Last night  And I'm like  I know that area  They said they were all the way up  To 51st Street  I'm like you can't see shit  On 51st Street  You're not going to see the tree  I went to leave yesterday  And they had it all blocked  You had to go up to 57th  Just to go to the tunnels  Did Obama go there or no?  No  He was somewhere in Midtown  But he wasn't near the tree  No he was having a fundraiser  Did they have big screens set up  Yeah  So the people that  Were not close could see shit  How about at that point  You go home and watch it on TV  Exactly  Why be on the cold 
[00:47:00]  I don't get it  And then they had the fucking  Dumb Rockettes out there  And all we were thinking was  They gotta be cold  Like the chilly vaginas  They're doing the kick line  And all I'm thinking is  How chilly their vagina  Because even a  You know  A young vagina  Has always got a little moisture in it  And when they're doing that kick line  That famous Rockette kick line  I'm just thinking  It's gotta be chilly on that fluid  They actually talked about that  They were cunt muffs  Which is like a little  A little fur liner for the panty 
[00:47:30]  Cunt muffs  Yes  They have a big box of cunt muffs  Imagine what those would smell like  After their kick line all day  They used once  Like daily contact lenses  And throw it out  Cunt muffs  You can just let it steep in water like tea  Yeah  Or you heat it on a radiator  And it holds heat for a few hours  There they are  Look at the Rockettes  Can I teach you something about the kick line?  Oh yes  That my sister told me  Oh  A little tidbit  You know that they don't hold each other?  What do you mean?  You know when they're like doing the kick line? 
[00:48:00]  Oh they're  And their arms are behind  They're not really touching each other?  You know it looks like they're all in one  In unison  Like holding on to each other  Yeah  They're not actually holding on  Why?  Because  Because  I guess it would fuck up the rhythm  Oh let me see  Go to the part where they do the kick line  It's so famous  I guess it was part of a special or something  On the Rockettes  There they go  And they actually are not holding each other  It looks like it obviously  Right?  Yeah it does  They're not holding each other  Oh yeah 
[00:48:30]  They're not even fucking holding each other  Look at all that gash  Stuff with cotton balls to keep them warm  I like it  It's sort of like a goose step thing  Yeah  That's not what it's intended to be  No it is  You think they're goers?  I don't know  By the way  I don't know what to make of the Rockettes  By the way Roland  If you care about me  You will get me some Rockettes tickets  Are you gonna go to that fucking thing?  No no I swear I won't go  I went  I gotta get it for the family  Remember when I was roped in  Pronto

They're impossible to get  When I said could you get me Rockette tickets  I knew it was almost impossible  Well we could get them  But we have to have the Rockettes  Behind Jimmy going yay  Oh I don't care  We'll have them fucking kick line their asses  All over the studio  Then you get tickets  What the Rockettes?  We gotta have the Rockettes  They wouldn't come in here  There ain't no fucking way  No Rockettes  Isn't that show sold out?  Coming in this fucking show  They have like five shows a day  Or four shows a day  So the morning and afternoon shows

[01:08:30]  Decapitated was the word  You were trying to get fired  I guess huh  No I wasn't trying to get fired  It was a mistake  No that's not a mistake  Oh was it  That's calculated  What a blunder  By the way the other writer  The other writer  Quite a blunder  I couldn't believe I just heard that  The other writer was Mel Brooks  Oh  Jesus  A little man named  Mel Brooks  Thank you  There was two other famous writers  With him as well  Larry Gelbert from MASH  Oh yeah sure  And Neil Simon  Neil Simon  Love on the rocks  Oh  It's different  So what  Jimmy was in  And Sam was doing

[01:11:00]  What are you doing  That's not what I  Are you a shock jock  You are a shock jock  You know the day of shock jocks  Is over Sam  You're going to have to  You need a little more  Diversity  That clip was so much  Worse  With  Leading up to it  Because I knew it was  Knowing what was coming  You'll never hear that clip  And it'll turn out differently  Where you actually get the name right  I hope  It's always going to be bad  My favorite part is Jim though  Hi John  Hi John  John  John  John  Hi John  It wasn't like he said  You know  I don't blame you by the way 
[01:11:30]  You know  I just couldn't  Like of all the names  There's a million names  And the one you shouldn't mention  Right  Was that one  Well I knew  You could have said Bartholomew  I knew his name  Yeah  It's just we had been talking  About Adam Walsh  Had we  Had him  Wow  You're just an idiot  That's good  Yeah  You're just kind of an idiot there Sam  He was such a nice man  Was he cool  Oh my god  Was he great  Fucking great talker  Because he's even done  A million interviews  Yes  You know he's a guy  Who's gotten a lot of shit  Accomplished  He's a great interviewer 
[01:12:00]  Dedicating his life  To getting scum off the streets  How long was the show off the air  Because we used to joke  All the time  Like who's going to be  The asshole TV executive  That takes that show off  I know  Off the TV  You can't take a show  Like that off TV  When it's helping so many people  It's public service  It's a public service  You're right  I let Jim do most of the  Heavy lifting  Oh you did  Yeah  Well  After you handle the questions  Drop the heavy lifting on your foot  Yeah  You are an ass  That's accurate 
[01:12:30]  You guys remember  Stevie Johnson  Doing the  Plastic Go Bears  Oh he doesn't have to  Call him Johnson  Yes  Making believe he shot himself  In the leg  After scoring the touchdown  Yeah  The Buffalo Bills player  Yeah  The fucking NFL  Fine him $10,000  Oh that's not even that bad  It's not bad  But it's the fact  That they're fining him  Over that  Because I would ask  The NFL today  And I wish I could get  Someone on the phone  Who was offended by that  That you have to fine him  $10,000  Who was offended  Not Plaxico 
[01:13:00]  What is that hurting  He laughed  Plaxico said he wasn't even offended  Said he thought it was funny  Water under the bridge  He said he got a good laugh out of it  And water under the bridge  Yeah  So why are you finding the guy  What is the logic there  I guess they want to keep their peeps in line  They had the slave master  Had to get the whip out  And give him a couple of lashes  But everyone enjoyed it  And the ones that don't enjoy  Something like that  You shouldn't be paying attention to them  You know  It's just about consistency  They need to keep them  All in check 
[01:13:30]  No celebrating like that  In the end zone  Why?  Because it's too much fun  It's too interesting  For the viewer  It's unbelievable  I don't know why  They just want to keep it  Might as well make them  Wear suits and ties  On the field  Oh  Jesus Christ  Seriously  Suits and ties  That would be funny  If they all had giant blazers  But I mean  You know  They're trying to get this  Like  This high class  Respect thing  It's fucking football  Man  They've taken a lot of the 
[01:14:00]  Fun out of things  They should allow  All of it  Because guess what  If the other team  Is a little pissed off  Because you're celebrating  A little too much  They're going to take care  Of their own  I think it's part of the game  Too  It's part of like  That whole  You know  Kind of fucking with the other team  A little  Psyching them out  Yes  Doing shit  Rubbing it in  You know  Can the team either  Look at it  And be demoralized  And do shittier  Or kind of you know  Right  Step it up  And make them look stupid  For celebrating like that  Yeah you know  Sportsmanship sucks 
[01:14:30]  It really does  In the end it sucks  It's not good for the fans  I mean obviously  You can't have a guy  You know  Clotheslining one of the players  Or something  But shit like that  You know  A little shit talking  You know I'm a huge hockey fan  Hockey does it right  They still allow  Way more in their sport  Than other sports  Right  They still allow the fighting  And stuff like that  And they'll have  Brutal brutal games  You know  In the playoffs  And stuff  And at the end of the series  They shake hands  Yeah  I like that  That kind of sportsmanship 
[01:15:00]  I like  But the other shit  They just allow  They know it's part of the game  They just allow it  Who's on the hotline  Hotline  Who's on the mother-hugging  Hotline  What the fuck is this  Hotline  What the hell is this  Does Justin have more info  On the  Adam Walsh  Justin  Oh  Probably not  They only find them  Because it involved a gun  Who's this  A fake hand  Like a finger  And a thumb  Gun  Yeah but it was still  Promoting 
[01:15:30]  Using a gun  And they're trying to  Clean up their image  Of being gangbangers  Oh come on  Stop I can't believe that  Really  Come on  That's why it was  Only ten grand  Oh I wonder  Is that  Is that the official statement  I don't think so  Justin  I'm not taking your word  For it sir  That's  That's what they were saying  On all the talk shows  Yesterday  Oh the sports talk shows  So this is second hand info  They had to find him  Something because  It involved a gun 
[01:16:00]  So they made it  A minimal amount  For him  Who knows  Yeah right  Alright  We can handle  A gun bit  Yeah  A fake hand  Right  A gun made from your hand  Right  Is silly  Mocking something that happened  To a player on the other team  Yeah  One of the Jets  Offensive linemen  Claimed it was  It was very insensitive  Because  He crashed a jet  Which reminded him  Of 9-11  Ew  Oh yeah  What a dick 
[01:16:30]  Why would you say that  Like you know  He's not doing a  Not a  I can see if he had  Two of his fucking players  Standing in like towers  And he ran into them  And they fell  Right  Right  They do a big stage production  Reminded me of 9-11  Well tough shit  Then I guess  Then we should never  Board a plane  Because that might  Remind you of 9-11  Those are the people  We should not be  Paying attention to  In this society  Let them be  Fucking miserable  Somewhere else  Don't give them  A fucking voice  From Utah  Huh  The guy is a Mormon 
[01:17:00]  From Utah  Oh shut up  And he even lived  In New York  Right  During when it happened  And he goes  Said it was very  Insensitive  It was  Poo-ha  Is his name  How about that  How about that  Alright Justin  Thank you for the info  Man  Thanks guys  Watch out  Alright  What has better ratings  Hockey or the NFL  Obviously the NFL  Joe  What are you getting  What are you getting  At Joe  Joe what are you  Getting at  What am I getting at 
[01:17:30]  You say hockey  Is this great league  Nobody watches it  I wouldn't say  No one's watching  I mean football  Has better ratings  Sure  Of course nobody  So you don't  So you don't want  So you don't want  Your NFL players  Celebrating on the field  Is that what you're  Getting at  No but I'm saying  The NFL doesn't  Because that's all  I'm talking about  Today by the way  The NFL obviously  Is doing something right  Because people  Keep watching  So they're keeping  It fan friendly  You're saying  They're not  If you really  Fan friendly 
[01:18:00]  No if you really  Want to argue  This point  The NFL  Has 16 fucking  Games per team  That's why  A shitload of people  Watch  Every game matters  Yeah I think  Joe's right here  And I've explained  In the past  Like baseball  And basketball  And hockey  If they knock down  The amount of games  They play  In a season  That would help  The sports  Of course  They have  Better ratings  And more fans  There's only  16 fucking games  Only 8 home games  That's crazy 
[01:18:30]  But Joe  Your point is  Well taken  What are you saying  Thank you  You can't compare  The two  You idiot  You just can't  Compare the two  Now but Joe's  Just saying  That the ratings  Are better  Right Joe  That's correct  Joe  And I  Want to get into it  The reason hockey  Doesn't have good ratings  Is there's a bunch  Of Canucks  And rookies  Running around  Nobody can pronounce  Their names  But  No that's not  You're racist  No  No that's not  Really it  It's a hard  Sport to follow  On TV  That doesn't help 
[01:19:00]  They even brought  In professionals  To try to figure out  How we could  You know  Watch it better  And that failed  Miserably  Yeah that stupid  Light to putt  Puff thing  That didn't work  Very well  But  But Joe  Let me ask you  Because you're  A big football fan  Do you want  These guys  Celebrating  And getting  A bit obnoxious  Or not  I don't mind  It  But I understand  Why they find  Them  Because they  Don't want  Fights  And things  Like that  Fights  Who cares  They do more 
[01:19:30]  Damage running  At each other  Full speed  Than a dumb  Fist fight  With all their  Equipment on  Yeah that's true  Yeah that's true  But PR damage  That's the big damage  Puerto Rican  PR damage  Like but who's  Offended by this  I want to talk  To these people  Who's actually  Offended  Nobody  You guys know  Sponsored  Sponsored  No  You know what  I don't even think  They're offended  It's just  This very weird  Gray area  Who the fuck  Is offended  Line them up  Let's talk to them  No one  No one's really offended 
[01:20:00]  Right  Yeah you're right  I think everyone's  Just you know  Scared  Yeah the people  People get scared  That someone  Might be offended  So they  Jump the gun  Right  And yeah  Find people  Alright Joe  Sorry about yelling  We're being proactive  Alright Joe in Missouri  With some logic  There I guess  Hockey ratings are lower  Because black people  Don't watch  Oh  That's a good point too  I mean it's probably  They're not getting  A big black audience  At all  You don't see black people  At hockey games  No  No  Women 
[01:20:30]  Because they weren't  Raised on it  I guess like blacks  And women probably  Don't watch it as much  Which definitely hurts  The numbers  Women kind of like hockey  Maybe not as much  As other sports  No definitely not  As much as other sports  But I see them at the games  Because you can look  At the buns in football  You can look at their buns  I think chicks mostly  Probably go to baseball games  Yeah  Because you can see  With their pink hats  Yeah with their pink Yankee hats  Pink  And the boyfriends  Take the girl to the game  Even if the girl  Isn't completely interested  You know  Just to sit there 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  You know  I just don't like baseball anymore  No  I guess I was  I guess I was faking it  For a bunch of years  On the radio  Thinking I was still a fan  And then I one day  Woke up and realized  Wait a minute  You don't like it  You don't like baseball  It's too slow  Too many fucking games  I like going to the game  Nice day  On a nice day  I hate when it rains  And you gotta sit down  There in the rain  But  On a nice day  It's cool  You drink  You fucking  Eat shitty food  Well these new stadiums  Are doing it right  Because you know  Now it becomes 
[01:21:30]  A whole day of  Oh yeah  There's restaurants  Museums  You can just wander around  Yeah  See they even know  We need more  If we're gonna charge  You know  Such a high ticket price  We gotta give these people  More things to do  Give them shit to do  In the ballpark  Yeah  Cause just sitting  And watching the game  Yeah  It gets a little much  Uh  J.O.  Okerson was on  The hotline  Really  Is he still there  Huh  No he's picking it up  Oh god  Oh the phones 
[01:22:00]  Oh  What's going on  Now someone has to  Have a conversation  They're having a conversation  So I can't pick up the guy  Who's having a conversation  Somebody is  It's like  Hey how you doing  If it's him  Just put him on hold  Who's answering the phones  I think it's  Who is  Who's answering the phones  Matt  Oh no  Matt  Oh no  Hey asshole  Why are you having  A conversation  Cause he was talking  You know  Oh shit 
[01:22:30]  Good point Matt  Oh he's yelling  Matt's answering  Matt  Do you know how to run  A radio show  If someone's calling  On the hotline  It doesn't matter  If they're talking  You interrupt them  And go okay  You know  We'll get right to you  You don't have a conversation  With the guy  Shut up  Jay  Wow he's uppity  Is this Jay Oakerson  Yes it is  Hey Jay  Hey Jay  It's been a while brother  No I feel bad  That I got Matt in trouble  Fuck Matt  No no one really likes him  Yeah  I'll be honest with you 
[01:23:00]  I was thinking  Fuck Matt  But I didn't want  To go there first  Yeah  Jump on the bandwagon  Believe me  You won't be alone  He just irritates everyone  I know about 24 hours late  On the Patrice tribute  But uh  Yeah I know  This is  No  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  It's  Yeah  That was the thing 
[01:23:30]  That made me the most angry  Was that upset you the most  Yeah  I understand  I uh  I wish I could have been in the studio  But uh  I'm down in D.C. opening for Jackass Estivo  I'm not bragging  I'm just telling you why  Oh wow  How's that working out  Uh  We're gonna see  A couple of staples  My nutsack to my legs  And we'll see what happens  Yeah  You're being forced to do  Some crazy shit  It's almost  It's almost like an audition  For the fourth movie  Yeah  Yeah  Did you know Patrice J?  Oh very very well 
[01:24:00]  Patrice was one of the first guys  Who really uh  Kind of took me under his wing  And like brought me around  Like comfortable with him  So I was  Able to have the ability  To learn from like  Really one of the best  And I'm really  As everyone is obviously  Pretty broken up about this  And uh  I said on the DeRosa thing  I was so  I wanted to call in yesterday  Yeah  To say because  DeRosa's laughing  DeRosa took maybe  Some of the worst beatings  Verbally  At uh  At the voice of Patrice  That I've ever seen somebody take  Yeah  And uh 
[01:24:30]  And for people who don't know DeRosa  What he looks like  He's built like uh  He has a body of a lowercase high  And uh  I remember Patrice telling him  With his uh  Sloping shoulders  He said uh  Joe's dad would never be able  To have a serious conversation  With him  Because if he put his hand  On his shoulder  It would just slide off  And if he ever wore  He can't wear book bags  Because they would just be  Around his elbows  Having to talk Joe  Off a ledge  For 30 minutes  He said no  That means he likes you man  He likes you 
[01:25:00]  Ah shit  That is funny  It was a real rite of passage  To have him bust your balls  When you got to New York  And I uh  I always loved him for that man  I really uh  He's missed man  That's  I know it's a big loss  For your guys  And the show  And everything  And Jimmy I know  Is a great friend of his  And it's just  It's such a sad  It's almost surreal  It doesn't even seem real yet  You know what made me  Just hit me again  It's like  It's been  You know for the last month  We've known how bad things were  But  I was  I was thinking this morning 
[01:25:30]  As I was getting ready  And for some reason  Platoon flashed into my head  And I'm like  Thinking  And I'm like  Oh that dumb Patrice  Loved Sergeant Barnes  Oh yeah  He fucking loved  To talk about Sergeant Barnes  And how he was one of the  Greatest characters ever  And he would start a conversation  Had nothing to do with Sergeant  But he wanted to talk about  Sergeant Barnes  So he would just go like  What kind of movies do you like?  I don't know  Do you like war movies?  And then he would somehow  Quickly barrel over you  To get to Platoon 
[01:26:00]  Until he was doing a monologue  On why Sergeant Barnes  Is one of the greatest  Movie characters  Of all time  And it's just like  Little weird things like that  You can't believe he's dead  Like  When he says  When you think of Sergeant Barnes  It's just such a  Complete association  With Patrice  Yeah  He did  I actually did a break  Here on the show  About that whole  About the platoon  And everything  Fucking great  I guess we'll play it  Over the weekend  Over the weekend  It's not going to be  Just like a four hour block  The whole channel  Is Patrice  It's going to be  Hours and hours 
[01:26:30]  I don't know  16 hours  I think they're talking about  At least  16 to 20 hours  Of Patrice shit  On the channel  This weekend  I just can't  I just can't wrap my mind  Around this one at all  How many women  In that 16 hours  You think jump out  Of a fucking window  That's true  How many husbands  Actually get the point  And fucking  Give their girlfriend  A fucking  Johnny Ola  I do have an ugly pussy  And I am annoying  Yeah  This one fucking hurts  People loved him  And other people 
[01:27:00]  Hated him as a performer  But everybody had an opinion  Yeah  You never could watch  Or listen to Patrice  Without taking a side  Like he forced you to feel  One way or the other  Yeah  He just made you think  He made you think  And he made you feel something  Right?  Always  It wasn't just  No opinion  I think he would do  My favorite thing  Patrice would do  Is when he would  Insult somebody  You liked so much  That you felt bad  At laughing at the person  You liked  Yeah  Like I won't say  The comic's name  But he got on a thing  One time at the cellar  With another comic 
[01:27:30]  Who was in the same  Management as him  When it was  With the Steinbergs  I believe  And at the last  The last line of the argument  Before it almost got physical  Was he goes  You should thank God  That I make enough money  So that Steinbergs  Can afford staffs  To send out your  Bullshit tape to people  Holy shit  That was one of the reasons  He had to hold your face  And walk away  So he didn't laugh  At the guy's face  Let me  That's brutal  I won't say the guy's name  Is it the same one  Where he was saying  Nobody knows you  You're not  You don't matter  Is that 
[01:28:00]  Yes  I think  Yeah  I wasn't even there for that  And I heard about it  Oh yeah  He just  That guy really would  Follow Patrice around  And try to see  Every time that Patrice  Had a rough time  With an audience  Yeah  I remember him  At the comic strip  Saying he's like  Yeah Patrice's in there  Eating shit  And Patrice  He wasn't eating shit  He just took the low road  On everything  And it was a time  That those miners  Down south  Got buried and killed  Uh huh  And he was making fun of that 
[01:28:30]  And then some black lady  Stood up in the audience  And she goes  I don't think this is funny  My nephew was one of those miners  And he was like  What the fuck  Is a nigger miner  Doing in 2006  Holy  He said that  And the lady left  And I'm like  That's not Patrice losing  That's him winning  In his mind  Yeah  He was  I told you  I was sitting yesterday  I watched him in  State of New York  Just violate an audience  Because they were there  To see a blogger  And they weren't going 
[01:29:00]  For some of his rougher stuff  And he just turned  And started to attack  The blogger  About how awful he was  And the guy's parents  Were there  And they got up and left  It's one of my favorites  I howled watching it  But he completely  Wow  Completely died  But he won  He didn't lose  Because I knew  What was happening  As a comic  He was not bending  To what they wanted  Him to bend to  Yeah  He won't get off the stage  And he'd rather  Everyone leave first  Yes  Yeah  He'd stand there  In an empty room  And just be  That's it  I guess 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  I guess I'm done  My work here is done  Everyone's left angry  Walked to the whole room  And he would pull out money  Because people would  Stand up and go  I didn't pay 20 bucks  To be offended  Or whatever  So then Patrice would  You know  Grab $20  And go  Well here's your $20 back  Now get the fuck out  Yeah  He's done that  He did that more than once  For your shitty drinks  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  He went up  He went up  At a CB's comedy club  I remember  He was getting ready  For an elephant in the room 
[01:30:00]  And you know  He was doing something  A little bit different  Where he was going to stand up  And he wasn't sitting down  And he was trying to go  Through a material  And said  Kind of just going off the cuff  And I remember  He went up on one night  And there was just like  A group of like  Ten just dippy  Shithead white girls  In the front row  And he got into two lines  And he was trying to get  Into some material  And he was like  You know when you meet  A bitch in the store  And I think he had  Two words in his  And he just goes  Ah fuck all of you  Just walked off stage  Wow  And he just came up  He was supposed to do  About 45 minutes 
[01:30:30]  And it was like  In the first two minutes  He's like  I hate this crowd  Fuck all of you  And he left  Classic  He went upstairs  And ordered food  Classic  You know I've read  A lot of Twitter comments  In the last few days  And the ones that stand out  I mean obviously  Most people  Especially associated  With our show  Loved Patrice on our show  But it came through  Here and there  People that absolutely  Fucking hated Patrice  But what they said  On Twitter was  I fucking hated the guy  But I'm crying  My eyes out  And I always 
[01:31:00]  I found that  Very interesting  That was the type  Of guy he was  Man  You know  He evoked a reaction  Yes he did  Yeah  But I mean  Usually  If an enemy of yours  Dies  You're not fucking  Crying  You know  It's just so funny  Also people  Just kind of  Give you know  They knew I was his friend  And they'd give  Condolences  And they'd go  This is a tragedy  He was such a nice man  And even in my show  They should go  I don't know  If I'd describe it  As nice  I don't know  If nice is the word  I'd go with  He was a great guy  Patrice 
[01:31:30]  Patrice was  Patrice was  Absolutely a nice guy  He was an amazing guy  And really just like  You know  I spent  As Norton will tell you  Spent many holidays  Together at his house  And just always  Welcome people in  And just  I mean  Didn't have to  Again you know  I was a comic  Who came up  When he was already  In the city  Doing his thing  And it really  Took an interest  And I'll never  Forget him for that  Man  He'll  He'll always live on  And you guys  Have so much material  On him  And that's why  You guys are sharing  With everybody  Man I appreciate it 
[01:32:00]  Let me talk about it  Well we burned  All the material  Yesterday  Oh shit  It was a cleansing  For us  Yes we felt  That we shouldn't  Be played anymore  The language  Was offensive  Yeah  And we burned it  In a big barrel  And we were drinking  From some fucking  You know  Whatever  We don't like the ladies  To be offended  Yeah  That's why we're  Trying to become  More lady friendly  To get some advertisers  We're trying to move on  More of that potty  Now you're going to  End up on the  Fucking Oprah channel  When he let his guard down  Man fuck  It was  It was  Really warm  Just the 
[01:32:30]  Vulnerability  And it's an amazing  Storyteller  And  Just pontificator on life  And just so  It was fun to watch  The evolution  From Patrice being like  You know  To a guy who just  Lived very surface happy  And you know  Pepsi Cola rapist  And I'm a fat kid  Trying to  Get chicks  When he was younger  Stuff  To you know  To where he became  Ultimately  You know  Conspiracy theorist  Just like  You know  Philosopher in his own way  A brilliant mind 
[01:33:00]  And in all the sadness  At least what will come of it  Is like you know  He's going to be a legend  Without a doubt  And he should  You know  It's weird  It's like  I've been thinking  About him a lot  And you know  Pryor I still really  Think he's the greatest  Comic in Carlin  But when you look  At Patrice  Like first of all  He had 20 less years  Than even Pryor  And 30 less years  Than Carlin  And when you  As a person  As a human being  All of those greats  Patrice could sit  In the room  With any of those guys  And 
[01:33:30]  And hold his own  Talking and  Batting back and forth  Comedically  Like he's as funny  As anybody  That has ever performed  I mean he wasn't  As evolved as Pryor  Obviously  But he  I think he could have  Gotten there  And I really believe that  I'm not just saying that  Because he's dead  He was really that great  You said yesterday  That he could hold his own  With any  Any person  Any comic  Living or dead  Any comic  Living or dead  He could be as funny as  On the radio  In the room  Absolutely  It was a funny comic  He was a funny human being 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  That's a hard thing to find  You know Jay  People get confused by that  Over the years  We have run into  A bunch of guys  That are hilarious  On a stage  But then you get them  In here  Or just in a room  In general  And they're not  Funny people  It's really  It's a thinly veiled  Excuse for why  You don't have me  In very often  You've just fallen  Through the big cracks  I don't know  We'll get you on more  Jay  But seriously  People don't realize that 
[01:34:30]  They assume  If a guy's funny  On stage  He's a funny human being  It's not true  Some people know  How to write funny  But they're not  Just like  They're not the  Day to day  His mind  Always worked funny  It never worked  In the tragic  It was always like  How can you bring  Levity to it  Even if it seems  Like it's being  Very sinister  He just knew  How to go for it  And I'll tell you  I've been really moved  By going through  Through Jimmy's Twitter  And seeing how many  Pictures can it look like  Jim is the happy  Bitch in a prison race 
[01:35:00]  I know  I know  It's funny  More pictures of Jimmy  Smiling ear to ear  He's looking gross now  Yeah just creeped out  By the little fucking  The white lump  He had to stand next to  But it was funny  That picture I posted  Of all of us  In the stress factor  I think that was  The benefit  From Masavia's son  When he was sitting  Or you're sitting  On his lap  And I'm wearing  My sabra-cadabra sweatshirt  And Patrice is there  And our heads  Are just back into the left  This is a weird photo  He's like  Rather than report the rape  We just turned our heads left  Yeah yeah  You both have 
[01:35:30]  Your heads turned  The same way  It's really weird  What was happening  That we were doing that  With our heads  Why  Maybe one of us  Farted or something  I don't know  It really was  It was like an 80's movie  Where you guys  Did a double take  Yeah  He was funny  All the time  The one frustrating thing  Working with him  Was  We would go to break  And he would just  Continue  He always continued  Yeah  And I can't tell you  I would say it  A hundred fucking times  Save it for the air  Save it for the air  You know  I didn't want to  Lose that moment  Yeah he was just  Conversing 
[01:36:00]  And he was so confident  He's like  He would look at me like  I got more of this  Yeah  I'm not even going to  Talk about this on the air  Because I got 10 other things  That are just as funny  Yeah we should have  The mics going off air  Yeah  It's quite some material  Interesting  Is too  Is like  How ingrained  In like  White culture  And white friends  Patrice was  He still had that black thing  Where he didn't think  Joking around gay  Was that funny  And the last time  I was in the studio  With you guys  Was when  Was it Bobo came in  And Norton talked him  Into a boner  Oh yeah  Yeah 
[01:36:30]  It was the only time  I've ever seen  Patrice  She was utterly speechless  Yeah  Yeah that was huge  Nervously glaring over  At this half retarded  Guy's boner  But he fucking howled  That's one of the biggest laughs  If you watch him  He howled  At that  He couldn't believe  That Bobo's cock  Was reacting  Were you in that day?  Yeah  Oh you were  Okay okay  With Pat Fubunaki  Yeah  Oh wow  That's a moment  Yeah that was huge  Have you seen the video online? 
[01:37:00]  Huh?  Have you watched it online?  No they have a post  Of online  Yeah  It's up there  Just search out  Patrice  Bobo up and down game  It's hard to watch  It makes me very sad  To watch it  But it's his big  His big laugh  And you remember  How he just  Watching him shake  Right before he laughs  And lose control  Was my favorite part  Of that video  Yeah  I gotta ask  Jimmy something  Do you think  Do you think  He knew that  He wasn't gonna  Live to old age  In general?  I don't know  Did he have that  Feel about him?  I don't know  I mean 
[01:37:30]  I think that  Patrice looked at death  Like kind of like  I'm guessing  Because he's diabetic  And he didn't take  As good a care of himself  It becomes an intangible thing  That's why people  Like we know it exists  But we don't always  Address it  Like you know  That's why drinkers drink  And drug addicts  Because you know  It's there  But yeah  I think that we'll  Say things like  Yeah I'm not gonna  Live forever  But I don't think  He saw it coming  This early  No  No I don't  No I think  Absolutely not  But I'll tell you  What there's such  Interesting  You know  If you go back  You'll find it 
[01:38:00]  Probably a thousand  Things like this  But on the roast  The Charlie Sheen roast  I rewatched that  The other day  And one of the bumpers  When he was coming up  Next like before  Went to commercial  You know  And it says  And Patrice O'Neill  And it shows Patrice  The only words he says  He goes  This may be my last show  Oh  Very weird  Very weird  That's it  That's all he does  Geez  Wow  I know it's not  What he meant obviously  But it's just like  Yeah  You'll find a thousand  Things like that  Where it's like  Yeah yeah  And now up in the room  He says  You know  He goes 
[01:38:30]  I'm 40 years old  But he goes  With all  He goes  I got everything  That kills  That kills black people  In the 77  And nigger years  Yeah  I'm 77  Yeah  Fucking  He was hilarious  God damn  I'm going to miss him  Thank you so much man  For letting me call in  No problem  Take care brother  Good job Jade  Thanks man  Where are you  You're going to be in D.C.

Turn it up  And get Jason  The hell that I'm feeling damn  Gotta get on the water  Get out of town  She got 300 horses  You can't catch me  I'm speeding  There's a secret  Good call  But I keep on my waiting  Pillowing out my balls  Cause they're always the season  This baby's got mirrors  They're there for no reason  Yeah  Yeah  I just wanna ride my jet ski 
[01:44:00]  Later  I'm laughing at the name of the album  Jason Ellis in studio  I like that, man  Yeah, it's about jet skiing naked  It's like yoga for 
[01:44:30]  I just figured out  I was really obsessed with  I wanna get out in the water  But I don't want sharks to eat me  Yeah  So I was trying to surf  I finally got over sharks eating me  And then when I would surf  All these fucking assholes  Get all angry at you  For surfing  And I came to surf  To get away from the stress  Of, you know, me  Working for the man and shit  Yeah  So I'm like  Look, I don't wanna fucking fight  Dudes in the ocean  I was trying to like  Become one with nature  And I'm like  How do I get away from these fuckheads  And still be in the water 
[01:45:00]  And I'm obsessed with being naked  You can't be naked in public  You go to fucking jail and shit  I got kids  So I figured out  I wanna get a jet ski  I'm sponsored by Kawasaki  Then I got a stand-up jet ski  And a stand-up jet ski is  It's a difficult fucking thing to ride  Yeah  So there goes the relaxing thing again  You're now doing the same shit  That I always do  Fight, jump, shit  Fucking skate  Idiot  Right  I'm like  I just wanna fucking relax, man  And then I figured  You gotta go sit down, yeah  Yeah, well there's  Personal watercraft 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, but in my world  The action sports fags  They think that that's gay  To have a sit-down one  I'm like  You guys don't have a fucking job  Yeah  You ride toys for a living  I remember that  You don't need to relax  Your life is a vacation  So then I got this fucking jet  It's supercharged  And it's 300 horsepower  Oh, man  No way, really  It does 70 mile an hour  That's fucking nice  Yeah, so I go out on that thing  And then I get out far enough  To just take all my clothes off  And just fucking rip into it 
[01:46:00]  And it's very therapeutic  And then I like to lie there  And there's always  Every time I park it  Out in the middle of the ocean  Naked  Seals come over  They're not gay seals  They come over and hang out  And I like to  Because I like to talk to animals  And shit  Because I've got fucking problems  And they float next to me  And I just  I mean I look at the sky  And say  Fuck yeah, man  You made it  You guys sell for fucking  300 horsepower  Fucking shit boat  And your dick's out  Here's what I'd be afraid of  By the way  I used to have a  Sea-Doo  And zip around 
[01:46:30]  It's a fucking blast  I love it  But I'd wear kind of a  Wetsuit bottom  And it kind of holds your balls up  A little bit  Because when you're bouncing  On that seat  The idea of having your nuts  Fucking down there  Where you could  Smash down on them  Is frightening  It is  70 mile an hour  It is dangerous  Yeah  If there's like a random  In the ocean  A random wave  Things can get hectic  And if you're flying off  The thing  And you land  Dick first  You could rip your dick  Right off  It would  But I've never done that  I don't turn when I'm naked  No  No, no, no  You don't turn 
[01:47:00]  Not even a fucking  Not one angle at all  Yeah, fucking dead shit  The balls sort of swing back  Because man  If you're turning on that thing  You do a nice tight turn  You hit a wave wrong  Boy, do you fly  Yeah, I've done that  I've done that  You can put so far away  From the thing too  You fly  You can step your legs off  On those things  Yeah, it's crazy  What do you do  Love it  I was just laughing  Because I don't want  Jason to think  I was laughing at a song  I'm laughing at the name  Of the CD  Called Death, Death, Die  That's my new band  That rules  Shirley did some stand-up  We did a gig last night  And he did some stand-up 
[01:47:30]  Before we went on  And he said that  Because Jason went to rehab  And Jason doesn't drink  He doesn't have sex  He doesn't fucking smoke weed anymore  He just changed his band  To Fag, Fag, Fag  And I was like  I really contemplated doing that  Because that thigh  Is pretty sweet  But Fag, Fag, Fag  Is like  It's in your face  Figure it sums it up  A little bit  It really does round me up  So, what happened to you, man?  Out of nowhere  We all learned  That you went into rehab  Yeah, well  You want to walk us through that  A little bit?  Okay  I'll try to do it fast 
[01:48:00]  Well, you were sober for how long?  I'm sorry, but how long were you sober?  Completely sober  Three years  And then I started  My little brother died  I started smoking weed a little bit  When I went back to Australia  I smoked some weed with my friends  And my old friends  And I was like  That was like helping me cope  Which was  That was the first mistake  How long ago was that?  That was  Four years ago  Oh, okay  So then just a little bit  But not much  And then  I had a producer  That Sirius 
[01:48:30]  Had  Just decided to be good for the show  And  He was a nice guy  But he was a fucking old idiot  And every time he spoke  It was like  Fucking chalkboard shit  And I couldn't deal with it  And I just wanted to go on the radio  And go  Cunt fuck  Fuck cunt fuck  Die  Fucking hate  I hate  So I was  Wait before the show  Alright, I want to slow you down though  The stupid suits  Thinking  Oh, we need to control the show  A little bit with Jason  It wasn't  Give him someone  That kind of knows the business  Yeah  He was going to teach me the game  And I was like  I don't need the game 
[01:49:00]  That's what I'm good at  Is accidental bullshit  I love asking you this stuff  Because we went through  All that same shit  It's like  Just let us do our dumb show  They would try to give us producers  And people that would watch over us  I tell you what, man  Things have changed  Good  I am not here to bitch anymore  About Sirius XM  Those guys  For once  They stepped up  Fuck yeah  They're like  Whatever you want to do  And I'm like  I don't like that  Okay, Mr. Ellis  I'm like  Wow  Fuck  Thank you  But we are talking about  The old times  When they gave you that guy  So that guy 
[01:49:30]  Made you smoke a little more weed  Yeah  And then it escalated  And then I thought  That I was being successful  Responsible  Making some good money  And why can't I have a beer  Every now and then  And then as soon as that happened  Maybe that took  I think it was about a year  It was actually after I was here  I did a Stern show  And then your show  And I was number one on Google search  And my manager's all pumped  And I'm like  You know what, man?  Fuck, I'm gonna go to the bar  And have a beer  What the fuck?  Celebrate a little bit  Yeah, I had a beer  And I watched a soccer game  One beer  I was like  There you go  You're good  And then every now and then 
[01:50:00]  On a plane  And then every now and then  At the fucking truck races  And then every now and then  I got paid to do  Club appearances  The death of me  Yeah, those are the  Those are the tough ones, huh?  Yeah  And then  Because they expect you to drink  And be out of your mind, right?  At those club appearances  Well, you're up to  It's like they say  Show up at 12  And stay till 2  That is not a time  For a guy like me  To be awake  I've got two kids  That's a weird thing  For me to do  Right  So  Then, you know  I've always been 
[01:50:30]  Somebody that wants to have sex  With a lot of people  Jim, you know  I've had sex with Chyna  Why would you do that?  She's not that attractive  She's kind of a man  Yeah  I like a big clip  You said that  Jimmy kind of  Had a little thing for her  As soon as I said that  Oh, you did talk  Yeah  You were like  Hey, hey  I'd fuck her  And I was like  Okay, cool  But, you know  I've always sort of fought  To not fuck everybody  Because I want to  Badly  And it got to the point  Where  There's porn stars  And shit  That were texting me  And I was  I'm like  It's gonna fucking happen  You know what I mean  And I'm  If I  Fuck somebody 
[01:51:00]  And my wife finds out  I don't have any family over here  I love my in-laws  I really love them  It's not like  The opposite thing  That everyone else talks about  When they're married  I love them  And if I fucking cheat on my wife  That's their daughter  And they're not gonna like me  And my wife's not gonna like me  I've got two kids  It's just not worth it  So in therapy  I just said that  I think we should  Split  Because I'm  Having urges  Of stuff that I think  I'm not gonna be able to stop  Sooner or later  And I don't wanna hurt you anymore  Because I did it  Back in the day  I did it 
[01:51:30]  I slept with a whale  And she found out  And it was just like  Not only am I  Cocksucking cheap  But I'm disgusting as well  I'm not saying  There's anything wrong  With fat people  There's a lot wrong with them  What made you  What made you go  Say that to her  Instead of saying  I'm gonna do something  For the sex addiction  I didn't know I had sex addiction  I didn't believe  That there was a sex addiction  I just was like  I'm a dude  I'm a dude that can't  I'm 40 years old  I cannot stop  Know who you are  And fucking let her  Live a life with  And find a normal person  That she can trust 
[01:52:00]  She deserves that  What's the difference  Between being a dude  And being addicted to sex  Well I'll tell you  I'll tell you  Cause I know  I have to do the  My life coach  Went on the internet  And said  Answered this survey  And I answered it  And he's like  Says here you're a sex addict  It's a thing where  You don't want to have sex  With people  That you have sex with  Like I like hot chicks  But if you're a fucking bush pig  And you corner me  You can blow me  And then as soon as I come 
[01:52:30]  I'm like  Oh my god  You're so disgusting  And then  Because I say I'm disgusting  I hate myself  And I want more people  To blow me  That I don't like  So it just kept going  And then it escalated  To you know  I mean the hard rock  I left my wife  Man  I don't  You know  I never loved anybody  More than that person  So it didn't make any sense  That I would do that  How long after you left her  Did you hook up with somebody?  Like two days  Did you already know  The person who you were  Going to hook up with? 
[01:53:00]  No  It was just  All the people that I was like  No I don't want to  But I really do  You know  I would say stupid things  Like I really do  Leading them on  You know  I can't  But I fucking would  If I could  Sure  Don't say that  Instead of just going  No thank you  I couldn't say no  Because you don't want to cut them off  It was fucking two people  The guy that has the A tattoo  On his face  Would say no  And then the other guy  Would go  But I would  If I could  And there was no one around  Well I'm  I'm a little confused  Because the little I know about you  You said you were  You know  Really in love with your wife  Right?  And now you knew 
[01:53:30]  You were going to do this  So you would rather leave her  Than do it  But why wouldn't you  At that point  Sit down with her  And try to work it out  We'd been going through this for  I've been trying  I've been wanting to have sex  With other people  For the last two years  Right  Wow  And I was  And I  And you just realized  I was just like  I'm gonna do it  You know  There was already text messages  And shit  I don't really want to get into it  That you  I'm  I'm  Intriguing  Yeah  I'm doing shit  That if she saw it  It's cheating  I mean I didn't 
[01:54:00]  It didn't go in the hole  But fuck dude  It mentally  And it starts slowly too  It starts with like  You're like  Hey if I wouldn't get caught  Like  Yeah that's really  Wow you do have a good ass LOL  It's something kind of innocent  Oh wow  Jim's on it right there  But it absolutely builds slowly  And you convince yourself  Like you'll actually  There's times where you'll write LOL  In a sexual thing  And actually go  Like you'll actually laugh  Just so you're not lying  But it's  It's complete  Self-deception  Complete self-deception  And it's all 
[01:54:30]  Leading up to  Inevitably doing it  Yeah so then  That whole thing happened  And you know  And then I was at the Hard Rock  I got this massive room  The Hard Rock gave me this thing  With a fucking elevator in it  And I'm hanging out with chicks  That I don't know  I haven't even talked to them  I'm sort of  I blacked out at the party  And I woke up  And there was a girl there  That was fucking  She was kind of hot  But not  I don't  I don't want anybody in my room  It's over  And then she  I brush my teeth  And she's  Doing some bumps  Like out of a fucking dime bag  And I'm like  What's that?  She's like 
[01:55:00]  That's morphine  You know  I got the stomach  My uterus hurts or something  And I'm like  I'm like  Jesus  I'm like  Oh  That's not  What you mean  It's heroin  She's like  Well whatever  You know  Whatever  Yeah  And I'm like  I can't  I don't  I don't sit in  I don't do  Heroin with people  I'm  I'm past that  And now I'm like  Here we go again  From back in the day  When I was a kid  Where I did heroin  I let hookers  Shoot me up with heroin  And I'm like  You fucking go there again now  After  I fucked my skateboard career  At the very end  I could have stayed  Now I've got this chance  To do radio 
[01:55:30]  Like for a guy to love  Something that much  Be good at it  And then fucking  Fall out of it  And find something else  That he loves even more  And is even better at  That's bullshit luck  Yeah  Don't fuck it off  So  I called  Therapist  And then I called  Psycho Mike  Who does  He's a co-host  With Dr. Drew  Dr. Drew called me  And then we did this whole  Ask questions  Blah blah blah  And he's like  You're a fucking sex addict  You need to go to rehab  I knew the weed thing  Was too much  And I can't drink 
[01:56:00]  It's ridiculous  So I was like  Fuck it let's go  And I went in there  And did all this therapy  And found out  Because I thought  They were going to say  Your dad died  Your brother died  You're trying to  Fucking medicate yourself  Right  And then I knew  I was molested  When I was a kid  But I didn't know  I just thought it was  The neighbor  Because that's what  My mom told me  Did you remember it  Or did you just  Like see the affection  It became obvious  I didn't remember  Until I was 17  When I  After a demo  I took acid  And a bunch of crystal meth  And I had an imaginary friend  And I was in a pool  In the top of a hotel  Talking to him  My girlfriend was just  Standing there watching me 
[01:56:30]  Because she thought  I might drown myself  And I said to my imaginary friend  That I was molested by my father  She called my mom  My mom said  Fuck I didn't think  He would remember that  It wasn't his father  It was the neighbor  And then I dive into it  In therapy  And the neighbor  My father and my mother  Went over to his apartment  Or something  And said  How could you  And he said  It wasn't me  My father is dead now  My father  I've never seen anybody  With a worse temper  Than my father  I've seen my father  Knock people's teeth out  For cutting him off  On the freeway  It's  You fucked me 
[01:57:00]  And you didn't  Because I'm a dad  You fucked my kid  I don't give a fuck  I'll kill you  End of story  I don't give a fuck  You're dead  And that my dad  Was way less rational  Than me  So then when I came out  And I stayed back  In my house  Like two days later  I came out of his house  And he's there  In the kitchen  He's like  Do you think  You got molested  And I was like  Yeah  Do you think  It was me  I was like  No  No I don't  And then I walked off  Went to the ramp skating  Never brought it up  Ever again  Do you think  It was odd  He asked you that  Like do you think 
[01:57:30]  It was me  Yeah fuck  Not at the time  No because  I just didn't want  I didn't  I couldn't believe  That it had happened  Because once I  Found that out  Then I started to  Like I could see shit  Couldn't see a face  But I could see a dick  And then I knew the game  Like the game was like  You know you do it  For this long  And I'll do it  For that long  Sort of thing  Like I got played into that  It was like  You suck me  And I'll suck  It's funny  I did that when I was a kid  With other kids  Right  Well then that  Made  You know I mean  Because then  Therapy of that  Because it felt good  So now  If it felt good  Then it's my fault  And then me acting out 
[01:58:00]  And wanting people  Because all I wanted  Chicks to do  Is blow me  And take control  I don't want to be  In charge of anything  Which is what he was doing  So  Then  You know I mean  All this therapy  Is like my father  Did this  And that's why  I am the way I am  And I told my wife  To leave  And now it's gone  It's over  Like I don't have my wife  My wife's moved on  And then my therapist  It's not your fault  I'm like I've seen that movie  Don't fucking do that to me  Yeah  Okay it's not my fault  But  I don't  I live in an apartment  By myself  And 
[01:58:30]  I don't want to  You know I mean  I don't want to  I make good money  And I live in some fucking shit  The apartment in Santa Monica  And she lives in  Beverly Hills  With my kids  And sees other dudes  And  How long have you been  Spoken up  Like three months  Well it's not that long  I mean  People take breaks  Sometimes you know  Yeah but I  Fucked people  And then there's  All my fans  That  Would be like  Alice is drunk  At the Hard Rock  And he's got some  Fucking tattoo bitch  And  Then some chick  Because I told her  When I went to  Rehab  I call  I had like  You know  I don't want to get  I had a lot of girls 
[01:59:00]  And I told them all  Like I'm  You know  I'm a sex addict  Alcoholic  And addicted to marijuana  I'm going to rehab  I just want you to know  I can't see you  And I would appreciate it  If you didn't contact me  And  You know  I don't want to be  Mean  And some of them  Were like  Cool  And some of them  Were like  Fuck you  Oh shit  Here's a photo  Of your dick  On Twitter  You know  I mean  Like  And so my chick  Sees that  And  I don't care  Because my dick's  On  Fucking Howard TV  And I don't know  But my dick's everywhere  Fucking clamps  Gay dudes  Fucking cupping my balls 
[01:59:30]  I don't give a fuck  You know what I mean  And I'm packing  So who gives a shit  But I  The only person  I didn't want to see that  Was her  And there's just  More stabs  More stabs  To the point  She's like  I'm moving on  And then she did  And she has  And she's happy  Jesus  And I  And I'm happy for her  But that's the only thing  Do you have a goal  Where you want to be  Like  Yeah  Because it seems like  Like that's kind of  A spinning out of control thing  Well I mean  Fucking therapy  All day  To be  I want to be  I want to be 
[02:00:00]  I want to get past  This whole  Sex addiction thing  So that I'm allowed  To see other people  I'm not allowed  To see anybody  And I want to be  I want to  I don't  I want to  Now that I know  What happened  It's far  It's far more easy  For me to be  100% happy  Right  Because I just didn't know  Why I wasn't  100% happy  I'm like  I got everything  But I'm like  20% depressed  All day  And I would smoke weed  To fill that void  So now that I've got that  I just want to see therapy  I just want to do it  Stay in therapy  Stay straight  Work on myself 
[02:00:30]  Because the only thing  I don't like  Like I forgive my dad  I forgive everybody  I don't forgive my dick yet  I just don't  Because I  Okay it's not my fault  Dude I was there  I know what I did  How old were you?  When?  What?  What was happening?  It was three months  When you were a kid  No no no  When you were a kid  How old were you?  Four to five  They said four to five  And then  Because I have a  I remember being  Underneath my bed  Holding  The underneath of my bed  With my hands and my toes  Staying off the ground  To hide  And he would come in  With a torch  And I don't  And like all these things  Because I had like  Some hypnosis and shit  That's a flashlight  To you Americans 
[02:01:00]  Thank you  Because it is a flashlight  Yeah  So all this shit  Because a torch  Is a torch  Yeah  No no he didn't burn me  He didn't burn me  But it's weird  Because he's my idol  You know he was  And he was a good  He loved me  But he was fucking crazy  And that made me crazy  Gave me a fucking sweet job  I mean  There's a part of me  That  The crazy bit  That people  Are entertained by  Like you know  If I'm scared of snakes  I get a nine foot  Anaconda to come in  The next day and bite me  That's not normal  But fuck  If you're listening to my show  That was pretty entertaining  So you know  I take the good with the bad 
[02:01:30]  Are you afraid  That if you get healthy  Quote unquote  Or stop doing certain things  You're gonna lose  The performance side  Of like Jason Ellis  Or like  The part that makes you interesting  Is gonna be gone  No  I actually believe  That that shit is overrated  I really thought  Less of myself  And thought that  If I didn't do that  That nobody would listen to me  But I'm actually more  You got more confidence  I'm more positive now  That what I say  Is far more entertaining  Than like  Hey watch me bleed  You know  This is  This is amazing  To listen to you  Well that's what I'm saying  I'm actually excited 
[02:02:00]  How long ago  I'm just a little bit depressed  Because of that one thing  That I  If I hadn't done this  A year ago  I'd be  How long ago  Was rehab  You just get out  A month ago  And how you doing  I don't  Need it  At all  Really  I don't need the  The drugs  Or the blowjobs  At all  I don't  Are you doing anything  Besides just  Like keeping it  Are you  Doing any 12 step stuff  I go to  I go to meetings  When I'm around  But it's not  I'm not even  It's not even really  Like I'm an alcoholic 
[02:02:30]  You know  I go to meetings  Just to be safe  It's the sex addiction  Thing that is  Because I can get  I feel like it's not  A problem  It's hard for me  To get around that  So  My therapist said  I can jack off now  So that's cool  Well that's the  That's the issue though  Is like  Okay  If you're an alcoholic  And you're in recovery  You know you can't  Have anything to drink  Right  Sex addiction  Now you've got to have sex  Sooner or later  It's like somebody  With a food addiction  They have to eat  To survive  Exactly  So it's hard  To continue with it  But you've got to know  You have to know  You're an alcoholic  Like you completely know it  And to me 
[02:03:00]  That's the one that's  Because you're going to  Black out and do stuff  There's no way  Sex addiction will stay away  If you black out  Yeah exactly  Oh no  A couple drinks  And all of a sudden  I'll be like  What's a blowjob  Come on  What's the big deal  But it is  The only  It's a tough thing  Because I  There's  I don't have any  I can't buy any weed  I can't buy any booze  I can't have  Even a bimbo  Like a companion  Like let's go to lunch  With a bimbo  I can't do that  So it's a lot of  Damn  So what are you doing  Showskying obviously  No  Well  No 
[02:03:30]  I'm fucking  I'm in New York  And I'm  My band  And you know  Fighting  And my kids  It's not actually  That difficult  Where are you at  With your kids  Because I know  How much you love them  Well my wife  We're still good friends  So I go  I live down the road  I come and see them  Every night  And I have them  On the weekends  I actually spend  More time with them  But it's  I just need to focus  On being really happy  You know  Practicing  Training like I train  To fight  Train to skate  On being happy 
[02:04:00]  Loving myself  So that I can fall in love  With somebody else  In the future  And be happy  And take care of my kids  What about the ex  What's that  What about the ex  That's definitely  Don done  I don't know  I mean I would take her  Back in a second  But I have  I can't think like that  Because I'm one of those  People that is like  I keep bashing myself  She's happy  And seeing other people  I don't need to  Fucking live in that  In that world  I need to  Just work on myself  And I imagine  It's humiliating  To have your husband  Publicly on Twitter  Being called out 
[02:04:30]  So maybe the  Maybe the satisfaction  Is  Hey look  I'm doing this too  I'm not trapped  In a humiliating situation  Maybe it's not the other guys  As much as it is  Just not being humiliated  I don't think she's in love  With anybody else  Or anything  But I think  I'm just happy  She's happy  But there's that  I'm in therapy  Man  I have that 20%  I wake up sometimes  And I go  And then there's a wave  Of emotion that hits me  And then I go  Fucking  Suck it up  Shithead  You've got two TV shows  Your kids are fucking awesome  Don't do it to yourself  But you know  I'm only human 
[02:05:00]  There's probably 20%  Of the day where  I do do that  I just think about it  What's the tattoo  By the way  It's Andrea  It's  With a love heart  Oh okay  Right on his  Like a cheer drop  It's so obvious to me now  The fight  That I've put on  I put that on  Will power  Like  You love your wife  Put the fucking thing on your face  Because then chicks can't fuck you  What is that  That's my wife's initial  Oh shit  You know  My whole back is covered  In a family of elephants  With determination across it 
[02:05:30]  Because I'm determined  To keep my family together  Like I was just trying  So hard  To not  Do what I wanted to do  Damn man  So you go to therapy often  Yeah  You talk to other sober people  Or just the therapist  Well I have a  Sex therapist  And I have like a  Life coach  I talk to life coach  Like four or five times a day  And my therapist  Two times a week  I can't afford anymore  Four or five times a day  But no sober people  Who are just not charging you  I don't have a sponsor yet 
[02:06:00]  Because I got out of rehab  And came to New York  But I call  I've got a couple people  That I'm  I knew in rehab  That I talk to every now and then  But I'm not  I call those people  If I need  If I think I'm going to use  I did a gig last night  I told my band  Can you keep  Drunk people off me  And chicks off me  Because my therapist said  It's the whole club  Yeah  So I mean  We played my new show  On Fuel TV  It aired last night  So I'm sitting in the  In the club standing there  Trying to watch a show  And it's just drunk people 
[02:06:30]  And a couple people came up  And the weed thing  Came off their face  Into my face  And I was like  Where the fuck is my band  Why aren't they  I want to watch the show  And then  I was cornered by a couple chicks  And they want to do this  And they want to do that  And they think they're hot  And I was like  Thank you  God you're in hell man  It's not that bad  It's really not that bad  I mean it's the story  I know I'm on the radio  You want to hear the story  There's the story  There's a lot of turmoil  But it's all around  You don't  I'm  My other TV show  Got picked up the other day  Me, Bam, and Tony 
[02:07:00]  I've been trying to work  That one was three years  In the making  And now I've got that  What's that show about?  It's about me  Bam, Margera, and Tony Hawk  All three of us  Are skateboarders  That work in the radio world  So that's where it bases off  And then it splits off  Into  You know  All the stunts  And the shit that we do  And Tony's traveling  Yeah  Okay  But Jeff Tremaine  Is the producer  The guy that does  Jackass  And Nitro Circus  And all that shit  So  It's all I ever wanted  Is this one thing  Because I just want to 
[02:07:30]  Get out there  And get bigger  So that I can come back here  And make Scott Greenstein  Bleed  Good luck with that  It's everybody's goal  Isn't it?  Good luck with that  He's a fucking robot  I believe I can get to him  Yeah  Yeah I know  I know  You guys have been there  Oh yeah  I don't like  But what I really want to do  Is pump this fucking album  Because this single shit  Rock and roll shit  I don't know if you guys know this  The number one rock and roll single 
[02:08:00]  Is fucking Nickelback and Daltry  And I'm like  America  Do you know how fucking gay you are?  Like the whole  You know what I mean  Like who's the biggest guy on radio?  Ryan Seacrest  Yeah  Like fag off  You fucking pussies  Like America  Canada  You're all fucking gay  Like fight the fight  You shitheads  I don't get it  I mean there's nowhere to play this stuff  Except for satellite  Well I made  Rock radio went away  I made one song on the album 
[02:08:30]  That has no profanity at all  It's called  The Pain of Time  And it's a song where the fans  Actually wrote the lyrics  About falling in love  And being gay  And having  Cheat  Breaking the chain  It's just all bullshit  It just actually doesn't make any sense  The whole song is just about being gay  Right  With no cussing in it  So I figured if it was really gay  That all you pussies  Would get it as number one on iTunes  Because I just want to  I want to be number one on iTunes  Good strategy  I like that you got an unplugged version of  You could go fuck yourself  That seems very nice  Right  When I had the other band 
[02:09:00]  Taintstick  We had a song called  Fuck Your Face  And we had a  A G rated version of  Fuck Your Face  And there's like four words in it  It's three minutes  And you can't hear any lyrics at all  The album's called  Ninja Flying Eagles  Right?  Yes  It's a  And the band's called  Death Death Die  Go Jay  It's a 25th anniversary edition  Because  It's been that long  We're very very funny Jim  Yeah  Fucking idiots

[02:10:00]  That I'm doing it  Like when I'm doing stuff  That I know  Is going to take me to a bad place  I still allow myself to do it  Even though I give out  Even though you know  Yeah  Ah  Yeah  Yeah  There's a little bit of joy  In every bit of pain  That I have  Because I'm like  Walt  Fucking  That's going to be an hour  Of glorious radio  You know  Your mom's still alive too right?  Yeah  That was the other funny thing  In rehab  I had to call my mom  And my stepmom  About the whole thing  And  Oh come to think of it  And I'm like  Oh my god  Come to think of it

[02:14:30]  If you love something  That brings in  Yeah but you always want  You always want a little more  Of something  I get a lot of satisfaction  But I don't  I think that  We're all the same here  We're never  Satisfied  Why would you  Why would you still be here  I mean  Right  I'm satisfied  You've done it all  I mean  I listen  You've got fucking cars  And guns  And houses  And shit  Yeah it's just a pisser  And hot fucking little girls  And shit  What the fuck  Like  Some people would be like  That's enough for me  I was like  A jet ski's enough for me  It's not  I need a boat  I need to run over  P.

[02:31:30]  A faded retro photo  Up on his Instagram  Of all you guys  Down at the cellar  And it was  That was really cool to see  Yeah he's got this  Weird photo app  Because we  At Patrice's barbecue  There was a picture  Of it  I think it's Patrice  Voss me  And I forget  Who else is in the photo  Bobby took it  And he's got this  iPhone app  It looks actually  Kind of cool  Like he took it  Like 40 years ago  You know it's fucked up  Yeah he takes these pictures  That's the Instagram right  That pretty much  Look  Yeah  It's like hip now  To have a picture  That looks like  It was taken with a Polaroid  Back in the 70s  It makes everyone 
[02:32:00]  Look like a photographer  Yeah but remember  When you went  When you could actually  Take those pictures  And all you wanted  Was a clear fucking picture  From a professional camera  But now the app  Puts red eye  On everyone  That's part of it  Red eye scratches  All kinds of shit  That one sunbursted person  Like it just places it  Over their face  We finally figured it all out  But that's not good enough  For us  Now we have to go backwards  We're just dumb as humans  We do that constantly  Like it was  The bigger the computer  The better  And now you know 
[02:32:30]  Unless it's a little  Fucking Mac mini  It's a piece of shit  And phones  The same thing  Everything got smaller  And smaller and smaller  Until you realize  Nah it's gotta be a little bigger  So I can see the pictures on it  Yeah we even figured out  The phone where it was like  There was nothing  I had a phone at one point  When I think phones  Were at their smallest  Where it was  About the size of one of those  Miniature Mounds candy bars  To give away for  For fucking Halloween  It was a fun size phone  Yeah it was a fun size phone  Literally a fun size phone  Yeah  It was like  Nah now we gotta make them 
[02:33:00]  Big again  We got bored  We got video on this shit  Now  I love people that are  Not ever happy  At how advanced it is  It's like  Yeah it'll be cool  When it's like  A thing you can wear  In your eye  That just shows  A heads up display  You know  You don't really have to  Carry anything anymore  Yeah cause that's such a hassle  Yeah I'm lugging around  My  My  Two ounce  Giant phone  Yeah  It's weird though  How like  Cause technology changes  So fast  All of a sudden  This is not good enough  Anymore  Yeah yeah  This seems like  Primitive garbage  You want something better 
[02:33:30]  It's so weird  Always  We suck as humans  Gotta ask  Dean about Patrice  Obviously  You guys started together  Yeah we did  In Boston right  Yeah  Year  It's  This is  Like  I know you guys  Have been  It's  It's  It's  This is unbelievable  But  It's like  Never gonna hear  That big laugh again  That's the first thing  I thought of  I was like  Oh man  You know  If you made Patrice laugh  You felt like  Funny  You're funny  For me anyway  It was like  Okay yeah  I should stick around  Patrice's  It validated you 
[02:34:00]  Yeah because he wasn't  He was no BS  You know  Patrice  Patrice  The best advice  He ever gave me  And what I  My first thought of him  As I was at  Nick's Comedy Stop  It was 1991  And we were still  Just getting to know  Each other  I remember I  I was sitting with him  He had his Discman on  He had his headphones on  And I was  You know  Trying to get to know him  A little bit  And I tapped him  I was like  What are you listening to  And he's like  Yeah you wouldn't know him  You know this  I finally broke it down  It was  He was listening to like  A bootleg version  Of Notorious B.I.G. 
[02:34:30]  And he played me that  Before you know  Anybody had even  Heard of this guy  And he was still  Bruiser  We were calling him Bruiser  It was before he was  Patrice  Bruiser  Yeah he was Bruiser  For the first few years  Back in Boston  But I remember that night  Having our first  Heart to heart  And he said to me  He said  You know man  You can't  You can't fuck with the truth  Be the truth  Always  Wow  And everything will roll off  Even if it's  Your negative truth  Bad truth  And it was the first time 
[02:35:00]  Anybody had really  Talk about like  I'm from Arlington  Massachusetts  I'd experienced  You know  Very little  And this guy's from Roxbury  And you know  Had seen everything already  By the time he hit comedy  So  Yeah cause he's 21  When he's saying this to you  Yeah I admired him  Right there  Unbelievable  Who knows that  He started what  92 or 91  He started  Yeah I was like  End of 91  And I think I met him  At Stitches  The first time  And he was  Like shy  And still kind of  You know  Yeah  It was wonderful  To see him  That's so funny  To even think of 
[02:35:30]  And when he said  You should embrace the truth  When he said  Embrace the truth  Did you just say  You're listening to a bootleg  And calling yourself bruiser  Oh no that would have been  A great fucking  Slap in the face  I don't know if you guys  Have touched on this  But like  You know  In the  In the feeble attempt  To like find humor  In any way  Shape or form  Especially this week  I'm like  I know Patrice is somewhere  Trying to communicate  With somebody like  Update my fucking Twitter  Please  Do not let my existence 
[02:36:00]  Hang on an AT&T joke  Someone hacked that account  Oh shit that's right  Please  That's right  We all went there  And saw the AT&T  What was the line  It was his last tweet  Which is always creepy man  Read that Sam  LMAO  Right there  You know he's like  LMAO  What am I doing  You went out with a fucking  Teenage girl  Fucking  What's the matter with you  That's one short  Of using an emoji  Oh shit  Holy shit 
[02:36:30]  Not a single human  Gives a shit  About AT&T  I'm mad  Because the bitch  Kept calling me  And wouldn't stop  Calling me ma'am  Calling me ma'am  And wouldn't stop  Yeah  That's kind of funny  Humiliating  Admitting that  The girl's name  Or his voice  Is something  Right  That's probably what it was  Yeah  It's a girl's name  Well Patrice  Well it's  That's funny  He gives his password  And then  It fixes  Twitter for him  Yeah really  Jesus Christ  It is  A miserable  Miserable thing though 
[02:37:00]  It's like you know  You keep going back  Even when we're having  A good time  Or whatever  It's like  It's there  It's like  Yeah yeah  You know  You can't get away from it  Ever looming  When he died  It was like  Okay now here's where it is  Like you didn't know  For a while  Is he going to just live  In this horrible  Horrible condition  Which nobody wanted  Nobody wanted him  To be alive  In that terrible  Including himself  Oh yeah  No no  Or his family  Or nobody  It's just you know  Nature takes its course  And that's what happens  And now you have to start  Like okay now  I have to really grieve  And fucking 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  But you get angry  I mean I know my dad  My dad who had been  Dying of cancer  Had a stroke  About a month before  The cancer got really bad  And I remember being  So frustrated and pissed off  Because you know  You want to  You want somebody  To have that last moment  To be able to really  Kind of speak their mind  About things  And whatever they want  To kind of  You know their closing bit  So to speak  You want to give them  That shot  So that's where  A lot of my frustration was  It's like  Ah you know  I wish you had a chance to  That is kind of a smack  In the fucking face  Yeah  Yeah it's like 
[02:38:00]  I've been dealing that  With like I said  My own pop for a few years  Not you know  Here he is like  In this state  And I'm like  I can't even  Because he had a stroke  And then he was  He had that syndrome  Where you  One word gets locked  Into your mind  And so he's trying to say  You know  It's great to be back  In the show  And he would say like  School school school school school  And not realize  I've never heard of that  I've heard of locked  Locked in syndrome  Which is where you  Can't communicate  It's a very  It's similar  It's like  Where a word  Flickers into your brain  And that's what you'll say  For sometimes days or weeks 
[02:38:30]  Fuck  But can you think  Other things  Or is that  Yes  Oh but you're  But you're  Your motor skills  Only  Exactly  It's like skipping  Okay  So my dad said school  And then it was cool  And then it was  And that's all he could say  So it was like  Here I am  I'm his only son  Trying to have that  You know  That conversation right there  You know what I mean  About you know  Dad  I'll take care of things for you  Whatever it is  That you want to say  And I felt that same  And I feel that same  Kind of frustration  With Patrice  I hadn't talked to him  In a while either  And that  That's always going to be 
[02:39:00]  A real bummer  You know  So yeah  Man this sucks  But he knew  The thing about Patrice  Is he was so smart  He knew  What the relationships  Were  Right  There was no  You have to have confidence  In that  He knows  Like he's not like  One of those guys  That needed things  Reconfirmed  Because Patrice  Wasn't a guy  That would always  Confirm things with you  He knew  If you were friends with him  He knew you knew  It was a weird  Understanding with him  There was a way of like  You'd see him  And it was like  There was no time passage  Yeah yeah  Some people you have to  Rebuild the 
[02:39:30]  We're okay with each other  Let's remove  The stuff  But yeah  He was just like  So man what happened  With the  And it was like  That was four years ago buddy  When my dad died  My sister was all about that  I wish I could have  Saw him one more time  And I'm like  Did you have a good  Relationship with him  It's cool  You didn't have to  You know  See him one last time  Yeah  You know  You just gotta have  Confidence that you  Had that relationship  And that time  Yeah  I was really happy  I'll tell you guys this  I was at the  Coconut Grove Improv  Down at Miami  And I brought Patrice down 
[02:40:00]  And it was  I was headlining  I was bringing Patrice  He was blowing me off the stage  And it was literally like  I shouldn't be bringing  I shouldn't have him featuring  Because  Doing 45 minutes in the middle spot  45  45  And then going into his closing bed  Which is another 40  But it was  It was like selfishly  Because I wanted to see him  I wanted to  Because I was also a fan  And so  But I remember us  Sitting at  The Miami Wings  The big Wings place  We would hit that spot after 
[02:40:30]  And I remember he was  Dating a girl  And he was  Coming to me  Going you know  I'm in a bad way  With my girl  I love her  But I'm not sure  I'm in love  And I was kind of  In the same place  I remember we both  Basically had the talk  Where we okayed each other  To break up with our  With our girls  And I probably went on  To four or five more  You know  Superfluous whores  And he met  He met Vaughn  Yeah  And I was always happy  And I remember he was always like  We were always appreciative  That we had that talk 
[02:41:00]  And that you know  He went on to  Meet somebody great  And I went on to  You know  Avoid herpes  Lucky you  I think he downplays it  But he was  He was in love man  I saw it  After his gigs  He would go off with her  And you could just tell  He was in a good place  With her  With Vaughn  Yeah  Very much so  You know  A guy that has a lot to say  About women  You know  In the end man  He was in love  He would always talk about  Like being a  Her being a soldier  Or him being this and that 
[02:41:30]  And it was like  You phony  You know  She's way too fucking hot for you  And you're paranoid  She's going to leave  He was  There's no way  He wasn't scared  She was leaving  And he was such a good actor  And such a good talker  That he actually convinced her  That she's lucky to have him  Right  He convinced her  He was such a great psychologist  He was a master interrogator  And a master psychologist  He really  Like I think  He convinced me one night  That I was black  He convinced me  I don't know how he did it 
[02:42:00]  But by the end of the conversation  I was like  I'm going to check my  Ancestry.com  Or something  I don't know man  He was like  You can't know that  Everybody started wondering  Why is Dane being late for gigs  Talk about Patrice  I'm running the light  How many times did you see him  In the bath of that red light  To get the fuck off stage light  I never wanted to go on after him  I love going on before him  And working with him  But it was like  I don't want to be bothered  If he's going over  I don't want to care  Right  Because I want to just enjoy it  Like you know 
[02:42:30]  He was  Fuck man  Was he funny  Did some news reporters  Say he was 14  Did I hear that  Yes  I'm fine  Please  I would love to  I mean it's kind of rough  To hear up until the last second  When Piers  You heard Piers Morgan  Refer to him as she  She  Her  You were on right  Cringe  God had to be  Because he didn't know  He didn't know him  He didn't know him  There's no way he knew him  But I  But I can only appreciate it  Because  I know how many times  It happened early in the career  Where you know  We'd go to a gig  And we'd bring Patrice  And somebody'd be like 
[02:43:00]  Oh I thought he was  Going to be a small white woman  And they'd be like  Frightened  Bigger than light  Here's how  Here's how it went down  Fox in New York  Sad news tonight  From the entertainment world  Comedian Patrice O'Neill  Has died  O'Neill died this morning  From complications  From a stroke  He suffered last month  The Boston native  Appeared in September's  Comedy Central's roast  Of Charlie Sheen  Where his struggle  With diabetes  Was a punchline  For many jokes  O'Neill was a well-known  Presence on talk shows  In the stand-up industry  And was a frequent guest 
[02:43:30]  On the Opie and Anthony  Radio show  He was 14 years old  How do you make that mistake?  Oh my god  All you have to do  Is read  That wasn't like  I just read the prompter  That was I'm committed  To my false  Fake  Teleprompter reading  Zombiehood  Because these idiots  Don't know what  They're even reading  All that fucking  All the shit he read  Before that  Should have let him know  He could not possibly be  14  14 years old  But he said it with confidence 
[02:44:00]  He was 14 years old  He was 14 years old  That's a hell of a career  All right  I was fucking  Delivering papers at 14  This guy was on all those  TV shows at 14 years old  Yeah, real forced  In the industry by 14  How many does that say  Our show is?  We had this 14 year old  On all the time  They can arrest us now  Yeah  When's the last time  You saw him?  I think maybe through here  The last time I came through  Oh, really?  Yeah  Yeah, I think we'd  Spoken a couple times  But saw him here  Yeah, you guys are all 
[02:44:30]  Off doing your own thing  Yeah, it was tough  After a while, right?  Yeah, especially  It's like  Comics were so  Vicinity-wise too  Hanging out with each other  That, you know  Once you're on the other coast  It's even more so like  Nah, you don't matter  Right now  He was on our show  For the last time  October 14th  I think  I don't remember  It was for the Carolines  Gigs  Yes  And then it happened  A mere days  Or a week later  Three days after  Three days after  The Carolines  He did Carolines that weekend 
[02:45:00]  And then it was a Wednesday  I think  Yeah, that's true  And I was lucky enough  To go to that show  I just  I didn't see Patrice for a while  And I was like  Fuck, I want to go see him  And we had the best time  You know, in that back room  Of Carolines  Just shooting the shit  Laughing our balls off  He sold out  I mean, that was like  The first time  He really genuinely  Oh my God  The place was packed  Yeah  He was on his way  That's just no fucking justice  Really?  Charlie Sheenroast  Was a big one  It let everybody see  Exactly what  That's exactly what he was like  Just dismissive  He was one of the best ever 
[02:45:30]  Yeah  He was one of the best ever  Yeah, he was  There's no doubt  And we always knew  Right from the get go  You know, it was like  I'm working with  One of the greatest comics  I'll ever see  You're working with  Something special  Yeah, because  And he did it on the  Charlie Sheenroast  He could throw it all away  Yeah  And there's comics  That work the room  Like, I'll throw it away  And I'm just gonna  Like, I'll piece it apart  With you  He'd throw it away  And then he'd come up  With a whole other  Right  Perspective  Without even needing  To go and get the help 
[02:46:00]  From like  Oh, what's your deal  What are you  Right  And to see that  And to watch it on the roast  Yeah  He made up  He made most of that up  On the spot  He'd make you want to quit  Yeah  He'd make you want to  I'm not worthy  Drive home with no music on  And just think about  What am I really saying  Up there  Hoping there's a cliff  Around the corner  You could go over  He loved Pat Cooper too  And Pat liked him a lot  They were great  On Top Crowd together  And we had both of them  Oh, were they in together  Oh, fuck yeah  Yeah, they worked well together  Two fucking loud guys  Oh yeah, Patrice  Would just start railing on him 
[02:46:30]  Oh, it was great  Pat loved him  What about when he dissected  Gallagher on our show  Oh, God  God damn, was that good  That was a guy  That almost killed himself  After our show  Oh, man  Was he fucking pissed  And depressed  Calling him a racist  And all sorts of shit  Gallagher, you're a racist  Oh, my God  Gallagher is all racist  Call him Leo  You're all racist  Reminded me  Calling him by his real name  Yeah  Hey, Leo  Hey, Leo 
[02:47:00]  You're a racist  Oh, man  Oh, what did he say  I bet you  I bet you imagine them  Watermelons  All little black babies  Right  I love the clip  Of him singing  Which I'd never seen  With the blues guy  That you posted  Oh, that was awesome  I cried like a baby  Watching that  It was amazing  I wasn't sure  If it was the right thing to do  But he came in here  With Warren Haynes  And what creeps me out  Is he picked that song  Yeah, yeah  He picked it  And knew it well  Because last night 
[02:47:30]  I went and listened  To the original  He sang it  Like Howling Wolf did  Yeah  He knew that fucking song  You know how like  Kind of as  As things were unfolding  It was like  Everybody was kind of  Holding their breath  And not really  Able to be emotional  About it  And it was Bobby  Who said like  The most kind of like  Offhanded  But like perfect  Moment that was heartbreaking  We were on the phone  A couple weeks ago  And we're talking about Patrice  And then Bobby  Which gets really quiet  And he goes  Dude  He's never gonna play 
[02:48:00]  The next Call of Duty  Dude  And he would have  Loved that game  Dude  And it really hurt  That like  He did  He's never gonna see  The new iPhone  And he's never gonna  Bobby's little retarded mind  That should be  That should be  In a book called  From the Minds of Idiots  That's how Bobby  Relates death  But he also  He's also one of those guys  That gotta make sure  It hurts  Even more  It's like Bobby  Relax  It hurts  You don't have to make it worse  You don't have to make it worse 
[02:48:30]  And list all the things  He'll never do  But that is a weird revelation  And it's something  Really simple  Those simple things  Yeah  Because it's like  It's something tangible  You're right  Death or eternity  Is intangible  What is it  It's there  It's the future  But like this next  We all know  The cycle between certain things  Wow  He'll never see  The fucking Titanic 3D  That's coming out  Because you know  When that's happening  And it's really weird  That's coming out  Yeah really  I can't wait  It's time for  You can see that guy  Fall off the back  I know 
[02:49:00]  The ISO  It's gonna feel like  It's falling on you  But you know  Something like that  You just know  What it means  We were looking forward  To Dane Cook coming by  Because it's been a while  Because you got this new movie  Answers to Nothing  And me and Jimmy saw it  And I fucking like this movie  Oh cool  Thank you  Absolutely  The first copy  That Roland gave me  I couldn't watch it  Because it was stamped  On the wrong fucking side  So then I got scared  They weren't seeing another copy  But then they ended up  Giving me one  I told you the opening scene  Was amazing  I don't know if you  Can we talk about it 
[02:49:30]  I don't know what  You know  You never know what you want  To say about a movie  Because you don't want  To give shit away  Yeah no it's  I'll say this  I thought the movie  Was going to be  Totally different than it was  From the opening scene  I thought it was one thing  And then I was like  Oh this is  Okay  It's not  It's hardcore  It's you know  Kind of like one of those  Grab you by the throat  Openings that  You know  If you're not invested  At that point  Just bail  If you don't like the movie  In the first five minutes  Then have a nice day  It covers cheating  It covers child molesting  It covers a lot of 
[02:50:00]  Fucking ground  That you don't see  Covered a certain way  It was very good  I don't want to give it  Any way  Alcoholism  Oh god yeah  Fucking yeah  But it's kind of  In the vein of  What I dug about it  Is that it's a genre movie  In that Magnolia  Crash way  Yeah  It's a bunch of stories  When we were talking  About this movie  Before you got here  Where like it's sort of  Has a crash vibe to it  The feel of crash too  Where everyone is  Kind of associated  There's a lot of  Different stories going on  But they're all  Kind of connected  Yeah  And you get to play 
[02:50:30]  She played your wife  I love her from Lost  I don't know her name  Elizabeth Mitchell  She's sexy as fucking  Yeah  Beautiful  Yeah she is  Beautiful  And like really  Just one of those  Actors who can be  Like vulnerable  And completely like  You know  Distant  At the same time  Like dual harmonics  Like Tori Amos  Can sing her own harmonies  You ever heard that  It's so weird  Yeah it is weird  She can sing and harmonize  At the same  I don't know what  The verbiage is for that  But she can sing  And do her own harmony  At the same time 
[02:51:00]  Is that a weird thing  That Axl Rose has too  Where the voice  Does two things at once  I've heard that  Described as something  I just added nothing  To the discussion  Nothing  Jimmy  I literally  I just  I should have  Opened my mouth  And just words came out  I kind of understood  What you were saying though  I can't listen to those  Because people are like  Oh Guns Rose  Back together  Have you tried to watch him  Singing anything  It's tough  People are in denial  It's tough  Especially knowing  That he won't do press  And when you know  What it used to be  He's just like  He just kind of like 
[02:51:30]  Mumbles  And then says  Whatever the key line  Because he's too fat  And he's wearing  That giant yellow  Curious George  You see that  Supposedly it doesn't  Look like that anymore  But I don't believe it  Right  You'll see the picture  Yeah  It's terrible  Look at that  What is that  No that's not even the one  There's one on stage  That's terrible though  And he's in Brazil  The hottest place on earth  And he's wearing a  L.L. Bean tent  That's Axl Rose  It's amazing 
[02:52:00]  It's the same guy  Look at his chins  Yeah  He's a big fucking guy now  He's a lovely singer  But I mean look  He always wore weird shit though  Remember he's like  Wearing an umpire's  Vest  Well the mean machine jersey  Was my favorite one  In that video  For Paradise  Paradise City  Yeah  Great fucking jersey  But yeah  He was a weird dresser  I hate the fact  That he just makes  The audience wait  That's why I hate him  He makes the audience wait  I went a long time  In Toronto once  Fucking a long time 
[02:52:30]  He still does it  He's not as bad  I don't think  But he still does it  At least two hours  I believe  He's doing his vocal warm ups  Jimmy  Didn't fucking get there  At 6.30 and do them  What are you doing  In between Skid Row  And Guns N' Roses  It was like two straight hours  I was like  What are you doing  Let's go  Look at that  What is that  I don't know  Dick Tracy  Yellow is very slimming  Is it a long coat  Or is it a long suit jacket  Without a collar  What is that  I don't know 
[02:53:00]  And then he's wearing  The where in the world  Is Carmen Sandiego hat  My mother bought  That computer game  When I was younger  I was in my 20s  She thought it would be fun  I was like  This game fucking  Eats my ass Bob  I'm gonna play this  Fuck Carmen  Who cares where she is  Exactly  I hope she's dead  In Uzbekistan  It's not a bad game  It is a bad game  What's wrong with you  Jonathan  You were playing  Modern Warfare  I'm on it yeah  Yeah  You like it  I wasn't in  I wasn't on that night 
[02:53:30]  You were playing with Bobby  And apparently Keith the cop  Took your care package  That came down  I was pissed  I was really mad  About the whole Patrice thing  More but I think  It just came out  Over a care package  In Call of Duty  And I let into him  It's like you were dead though  You were fucking  No he was being  A selfish little bitch  And I wanted my  UAV  Now you have such a  Notorious reputation  For knifings 
[02:54:00]  I do  In that game  You really do  Do you get more  Kills with knives  Or with the guns  Not on the new one  The new one  It's impossible  It's hard  Yeah the way they  Made spawn points  And all that crazy  Whatever they updated  On the AI  You can't really knife anymore  So now I'm back to like  Just semi-automatic  It just hurts  The only time you can get  You like making it hurt  I get knifed all the time  Is when I come around a corner  And I'm face to face  With somebody  Yeah  And I never  I don't have that reflex  To hit the knife right away  I always go for the gun  And wind up  I get knifed  And I'm like 
[02:54:30]  Why can't you have a mirror  In that game  A mirror  It would be nice  You would in real life  So he was constantly  Getting shot in the back  Of that guy  Yeah the technology  Of the soldiers  Have like little  Yeah  See behind you  Fuck that  But you're probably  Dealing with somebody  Using one of those  Mad cats controllers  That has the extra buttons  On the bottom  Yeah  Do they have them?  Yeah yeah  There's a  And it's not a modded controller  It's just one with a couple  Extra buttons  That if you just squeeze  It's gonna knife  Instead of having to push down  So you get a 14 year old kid  Who obviously is  You know  Faster than any of us anyway 
[02:55:00]  And he's just  You know squeezing  Do you have one of those controllers?  No  You ever try to  Draw your gun up real quick  And hit the knife  When you're trying to shoot  I've done that so many times  You walk up to someone  In a room  And you're like  Ah cool man  I'm gonna nail this guy  And you gotta pick your gun up  And you hit the knife  And then he turns around  And just rakes you  I hate to say this  I'm getting too old  To play multiplayer  Cause I finally am like  Really  Like a platoon  Like I'm really mad 
[02:55:30]  At a 14 year old nobody  I hate this  You're playing  You get killed  And then the kid next to you  Is literally just facing the sky  Doing spins  And I'm like  You're just fucking spinning  Cover my six  So what are you doing?  Thanks for the help  Asshole  It's a kid  Yeah  I'm really mad  That's funny  Spending five minutes  Trying to get up a ladder  And then they'll start talking  To the front  But leave their mic on  It's like  I don't know  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna go tomorrow?  Cause I think  Turn off your mic 
[02:56:00]  I'm in war  That's  It is terrible  I don't know  My mom  She's not getting home  For another 15 minutes  Or so  I could play for a little longer  But I don't know  Becky  Give it to yourself  Yeah  I don't know  I think I'm trying to  You know  You're really taking me  Out of the game here  A million times  Are you gonna prestige?  Are you gonna prestige?  Why don't you prestige?  You don't prestige  You're a fag  Prestige  What does that mean?  If like  You unlock everything  And you hit a level 80

I did  This is the  I finally  Just so people would shut up  And I hated myself for it  They don't like  When you're level 80  And you're walking around  And playing the game  It's like  Hey what are you doing?  You're supposed to  Fucking give it all away now  Yeah it's like  If I had served 
[02:57:00]  You know  In Afghanistan  And Iraq  And came home  It's not  They're not gonna  Wipe my memory clear  And then give me  You know  A musket  And send me back  Start over  You're gonna start over  You catch up to me  Yeah they don't take  Your stripes and medals  And send you back  As a private  Exactly  That's what they do  You get better  Fuck that  Prestige  I play those games  But then I just try  To talk everybody  Into getting along  He's at a peace summit  Guys please  This is not necessary  We didn't talk about the movie  The brand new  Where in the world

[02:58:00]  Oh it's on demand  Yeah  Started tomorrow  It's also BOD  Yeah  Okay  I would absolutely  Fucking get this on demand  I love that that's  Going on these days  Where some movies  It's like  They put it on demand  For you know  A week or so  And then it hits theaters  And shit like that  Cause I am all about  Staying home  And watching fucking movies  Right right  Well now most people  Have like great sound systems  You got like a cool plasma  It's like  You know  Not every movie  Is a tent pole  Gotta see it with a crowd  Godzilla affair  I just wanna watch a movie  With my girl at home  Most people  Have a better system

[02:59:00]  Ten times  You can prestige  Ten times  And then what happens  Then after that  You realize that  You're nothing  And then it's like  This was a waste of time  You should have  Worked on a trade  Yeah  You should have  Go to a vocational  Tech school  I needed a backup  I could have  I could have been a  Painter  You have to go  Through a gender  Transformation  That'd be great  Yeah  What's your favorite  Weapon in the  In the game  I like the  Because I'll do the  I'll do the  Hardcore  Hardcore team  So  I love that  Yeah  I'm using the MC 
[02:59:30]  What is it  No the ACR  And I'll throw a grip  And a silencer on there  It's literally one shot  Yeah that's it  That's why I like  Playing hardcore mode  If you're not playing  Hardcore mode  You could shoot someone  Like five times in the chest  Nothing happens  They shoot you once  And you're dead  Hardcore  You pretty much  Hit someone once  In a good spot  They're dead  Yeah and they die  In real life  Yeah yeah  It's a butterfly effect  Takes place  So it's most important  You don't need  The automatic fire  And shit like that  So you can trade in that 
[03:00:00]  For  You know  Maybe not being  As obvious to other people  On the map  Shit like that  Like a silencer  Or  I like using some of the perks  That make me a little more  Invisible to  People's radar  And shit like that  Yes  You like to be off the grid  Is what you're saying  Off the grid  Dane  Yes  But yeah  I only play hardcore now  Because the other shit  It's just like  Really  Yeah  I sit  And that's what you hear  From me  On there  Really  Really  I fucking hit him  Five times  Once in the fucking face 
[03:00:30]  Really  Dude play hardcore  What are you doing dude  Play hardcore dude  Yeah  Why don't you play hardcore  You faggot  Alright I'm a faggot  Yes  Great  Great  Kid just call me a faggot  I never played that game  Oh you should Jimmy  You love it  It's my only vice  I have nothing else  I've never  Alcohol  No addictive personality  But my one thing  Was video games  And what was so weird  Is like  I didn't play for a year  I actually have not  Played a full year  Since the last game  The last version I think 
[03:01:00]  Basically  But I think it's this weird  Thing for my child  I was talking with my  Therapist about it  Like I could only play  Video games when I was younger  When my mom would come home  And be like  You know you get a pound  The pavement day  And if you don't  You know earn your stripes  And yada yada  And so I never felt good  About playing something  Unless I worked  And earned it  And because I took  Pretty much a year off  You know of comedy  And everything else  I didn't play a game  Because I really didn't feel  Like I had done something  To warrant it  Wow  Okay  Still in you  Yeah once I got back  On doing the junk  And all that  I was like  I'm gonna get the new one 
[03:01:30]  Treat yourself  Yeah isn't that weird  I'm a lazy slob  I play all the time  What'd you do in the year off?  Nothing  Really  Yeah nothing  Travel at all?  A little bit  A little bit  But just  You know I went straight  I was like  I was straight through man  For a long time  It was like to that point  Of just  Crazy run you had  You know  Yeah it was like  Alright let's  The first ten years  Is the hustle of like  Please let me get out of this  You know foxhole  Of you know  Please let my family  Not behind my back go 
[03:02:00]  What did he do  You know what I mean  And then you get there  And you're like  Alright now I wanna  Maintain it  But when it blew up  For me like  Really big  I was like  I gotta keep this level  And so it was like  Six straight years  Until you know  Personal stuff  Starts to happen  But you're just  You're working through that  You're like  Okay you know  My mom's sick  My dad  You're doing all this stuff  And then you finally realize  Ah it's  Super unhealthy  I need to stop  And like you know  Chill  And like feel some stuff  For a minute  You realize you're not  Going to just 
[03:02:30]  Keep going  And be satisfied  With that  You know  Yeah  Because you will just  Keep driving right through it  True  You gotta kinda  Yeah stop  Sometimes it's forced  Like we were forced  To stop when we got fired  It was kinda nice  We got the fucking boot  We were off for two fucking years  Parts of that was nice  And it was like  Yeah it was like  Ah  I don't have to worry  About what the ratings are  I don't have to worry  That we put on a great show  Yesterday  And now here's  The next day  Do it again asshole  Yeah and you assess  Like it was great for me 
[03:03:00]  And I feel the same way  It was the best year  And you kind of assess  And also like  Appreciate certain things  That you wouldn't think to  You're like so busy  Just like  Getting in there  Next fight  Next fight  That you  You're not looking around  You're like oh yeah  I've done some cool stuff  That I could  That's like  Some would say enough  You know  What do I want to do now  Where do I want to take my fans  Is what I was asking  A year ago  And I was like  If I don't feel good  Then whatever I do  Is not authentic with them  So it was like  Take a year  And now the stuff  That I'm developing  I'm really glad  To share with them  And you really did nothing 
[03:03:30]  You had to be doing  And I wrote  You know I wrote  I did a couple  Little indies  A couple more indies  But I mean on a regular  Like day to day  What would you do  Hike  Get up at 10  Or sleep all day  No definitely was not  Sleeping  Just you know  Got up  My youngest sister  Came out to LA  So I was like  Just kind of  I hadn't hung with family  In so many years either  So it was nice to have  Like family back  Hanging out with me  And just like  I felt like I was just doing  Regular person stuff  For a minute  Which was like  Just wonderful  But I was still writing  And developing  Now I'm working with NBC 
[03:04:00]  On a show  But I'd worked on that  For like the year  So I was still  Kind of like pairing up  And hanging with people  Like people I really admired  That I wanted to just  Take to lunch  And be like  Oh maybe we could figure out  If there's something  We want to do together  At some point  So it was just kind of  Like a re  Reforming year  I guess  A reboot  A reboot  You feel like  You feel like at times  That if you're not  Just plugging away  Constantly  That you're going to  You're a failure  Yeah  Instantly  It's like I took  The weekend off  I didn't go to a club  This weekend  Everyone has passed me  They all forgot me 
[03:04:30]  I'm done  I'm a husband  It feels like that  Yeah  Yeah  It feels like I'm going  To lose everything  And be forgotten  Immediately  If I don't do  Fucking sets tonight  Yeah  Fear of abandonment  Issues galore  With most comics  With comics  Come on  Yep  Stop  Never  That's it  We should just  We should just have  Like a code  Where we all just  Hug each other at the door  Just like  I know  I know  We really should be  Hugging each other  A lot more than we do  Through all the angst  And insecurity  Me too  I need it  Me too  Yeah  When you're doing 
[03:05:00]  Arenas and stuff  I remember Dice  After he stopped  Doing arenas  Like he was still  Doing 5,000 seats  Sometimes 9,000  But it felt like  He was obsessed  With getting back  Into the arenas  Now I know  You can still do them  But if you do a market  Where you did an arena  And then you come back  And it's like  Ah man  We just did 6,000  Instead of 15,000  Do you become obsessed  With getting back  Into the arena  Or are you like  Jesus Christ  6,000 people  Is an amazing place  To level off at  Fortunately  I don't feel like  It has to be an arena  But it's like  The level of  How I worked on my show 
[03:05:30]  To get it to that point  It's like  I can't even go  Into the club  Or I couldn't  I was even going  Into the factory  Like I used to enjoy  10 people  I could just enjoy  Getting up there  But because I'm coming  And just hanging  I need to be okay  That they're going  To look at me  And just be like  Oh this is just  Not  This is okay  This isn't the arena show  That everyone's paying  This much money for  And now  I was starting to like  That was  You shouldn't be thinking  Right  It's like thinking  Of who's at the back 
[03:06:00]  Of the room  Watching you  Once you leave  Your body  You're done  Me and Jimmy  Have talked about  A shitload  But when we saw you  In Boston  At the old Boston Garden  And you fucking  Killed it  And then we walk out  And they're lined up  For a second show  Me and Jimmy  Looked at each other  Like  Holy fuck  We couldn't even  Just  It was just  An amazing  Fucking feat  Yeah  People don't understand  That I don't think  Sometimes  You fucking had him  Lining up for a second show  At the Boston Garden  That's rockstar  And how many people 
[03:06:30]  Was it  18, 19,000  18, 19,000  Most people  Would love to do that once  He did it twice  In one night  I'd be happy to do that  Over the course  Of six months  Spread out  In 14 cities  We couldn't get out  Of there  Because everyone  Was waiting to get in  For the second show  But  You're like  And it was just  You and a stool  Yeah  What the fuck  Yeah it really  And I know  What Kellner shot  Right  Which was  Marty Kellner  I think directed  Which was  Such a great show  Because he did  The Stones  He did Carlin  Yeah  And it was like 
[03:07:00]  That shot  Oh it was fucking great man  And it was like  That was what  An arena show  Should look like  Absolutely  And some comics  Could work in arena  You worked in arena well  I mean it was like  It just looked like  It belonged  It didn't look out of place  No you owned it  I went to Marty Kellner  Because I saw  Carlin  Live in Arizona  77  And Kellner directed it  And it was Carlin's  First in the round show  Was this the celebrity theater  Yeah  And I remember seeing that  Years and years ago  And feeling like  Oh that's  And then I saw Carlin  At the South Shore 
[03:07:30]  Music tent  Years back in Mass  And that's like  2000 in the round  And then I  That was my first  In the round show  I played there  In like 97  I was like  If I could ever do  A big arena show  I'd do in the round  And that was great  To do with Marty  So that night was  Fucking Carlin  That was amazing man  We were fortunate enough  To have him do our show  At the end of his life  A bunch of times  Yeah  I remember seeing him  With you on  Tough Crab  Yeah  You guys were  Like  Priest and altar boy  I hope that's a photo  Somewhere in your own  Because I remember  Just being like  Norton must be  So psyched right now 
[03:08:00]  He was loving you man  I have a photo  On my  On my  On my fucking  When you walk in  It's me and Carlin  He's dressed like a priest  I'm dressed like a  An altar boy  And I got him to sign it  He wrote you know  George Carlin  I think SJ  And someone told me  That's Society of Jesuits  Is what it means  Like he signed it  Like a priest  So it was a great  Oh there it is  Look at that picture  Remember that  Oh man  That's fucking classic  That is classic  That's rich  Yeah it's a fucking  Great shot  Great shot  Answers to nothing  Yeah  People really should  Check out this movie 
[03:08:30]  Yeah  I like the  The brother  Sister  Fucking story  Rough  Yeah  And saw it after  You know  Patrice  Yeah no it's  Listen it's a  Provocative movie  It's the kind of movie  That you know  You leave and you  Want to talk about it  You know  I like movies like that  You want to dissect it  You know  You know somebody in it  Something about yourself  Is reflected in it  So it was  I was psyched  That the director  Sought me out for it  Yeah  Absolutely 
[03:09:00]  I always think  It's funny too  Because everybody's  Talking about Patrice  And tweeting about him  It's a lot of love  For a guy who deserves it  And is funny enough  To deserve it  But it's funny to me  It's like  Do you know how many of you  And I don't mean the fans  I mean the performers  Do you know how many of you  He had no respect for  Do you know  Do you know how little he respected you  Oh shit  What shit he thought you were  I think we can all pick out a few names  How he would have dominated you in a room  And just dismissed you 
[03:09:30]  And scrunched his  Yeah  The Patrice scrunch  Oh it's awful to get that face  Do you think he would like  All this attention  Yes and no  He would be annoyed by some of it  But he was not so  He was so intuitive  He would have appreciated it too  He was not a dumb guy  He would have known  That that love  Was an impressive show  From people  And he was not unmoved  Unmovable  By stuff like that  When he knew people loved him  Or when you showed him  He was like  Oh wow  Thanks man  Oh thank you  Thank you man  Like he was defensive 
[03:10:00]  Probably a lot of that  Was him being defensive  Like he didn't know  People would love him  As much as they did  And I think that was like  When you showed him affection  Or like  Like Jonathan said that  Because Jonathan managed  Patrice as well  And he  Said that when  I went to see part of his special  Taped at  In  Belph in the room  Yeah  And I stayed for a few minutes  Because I had a set  And I didn't see Patrice  Because he was already on stage  And Jonathan told him  That Norton became  He's like  Really?  Like he was surprised  That I'd come by  I was like  No of course  He forgot sometimes  That yeah people like you  Stupid 
[03:10:30]  We're your friend  I absolutely  You were there  I have a similar story  I went back to see him  And his mom  And he's like  What are you doing here?  I'm like  What are you talking about?  There's a big deal for you  And I feel like we're friends  And I want to come here  And support  Yeah I meant a lot to you  Yeah well  Fuck  Yeah but I'm  Trying to make me cry more  No but I think that's what  It's funny to me  How much he would be annoyed  By some of these people  But he would appreciate it overall  But I guess what we're trying to say  Is when he did drop his guard  It was awesome  It was fun  Because it didn't happen a lot  We  You know 
[03:11:00]  Myself  Bobby  Bill Burr  There was a gang of us  Like he  You know  Patrice is in my graduating class  You know  We started together  But I will always remember  Sitting at  There was a  There was a place across the street  From Nixon  In Boston  It was like an old  Before it was Bennigan's  But then Bennigan's  And we'd hang there  And it was like  Still at a time where  You know  We all would be  Really helping each other out  With our sets  And  That was a time when  You know  To see Patrice  Becoming what he was 
[03:11:30]  And forming that  That persona  And the attitude  That  I wouldn't even say the attitude  But like  The first one to be like  What I am now  I'm going to bring that to the stage  As opposed to like  Some of you guys  That are up there  Just trying to  You know  Do shtick  And  And I  To be thinking about  Those conversations  Which I'd forgotten about  Of him being like  Questioning like  Yeah  Do you think that  That I should be saying that  I should be talking about  I think I should drop that  Malcolm XXL thing  Maybe like that's  And to see him at a point  Where he was 
[03:12:00]  Extremely  Kind of  Again vulnerable  And open  It made me realize  And you know  You see those moments  With other people  You know  We always joked about  Like he could be  Such a kind of a bully  Like you know  The way he could seemingly  Push anybody out  With the stare  But we remember  Patrice that was  You know  You know  Wanted to grow  As a performer  You know  He wouldn't have been there  If he didn't  And that's what  I remember a lot  Is the encouragement  We all gave each other  At that early 
[03:12:30]  And the people  That probably quit  Because Patrice is like  No man  You shouldn't be  You shouldn't be here  A lot of people's favors  Yeah  Jonathan you got anything  Sorry Dane  I thought you were done  I was going to say  No he escorted  I'm sure a lot of people  Out the comedy  This way  There were a lot of people  On the fence  And I think what he  Would do  Is just shake the fence  And you'd fall off  On the other side  Nobody ever fell  He never shook the fence  And had somebody  Fall in front of him  It was always 
[03:13:00]  On the opposite side  On the not comic side  Try to hold on man  I saw him stop a show  Because of a heckler  Who kept  It was in Chicago  And Hannibal Buress  Had opened for him  And  And um  This guy would not  Stop heckling Hannibal  And then  Patrice got on stage  And the guy  Tried saying something  To Patrice  And that was it  He stopped the show  And he goes  Okay  I'm going to give you  Your time now  Come on up  Come on up  And the guy  Got so embarrassed  And he just  Eviscerated him 
[03:13:30]  And uh  You know  Because he  He had the respect  For the other comics  And you know  He was not one to  You know  It's funny  When you were talking  About earlier  About um  People that he  Didn't like  There's a guy  That was tweeting  Yesterday  Who I know  For a fact  Patrice  Hated this guy  And the guy  Tweeted something like  I'm devastated  At the loss  Of Patrice O'Neill  He's a complicated  And difficult guy  At times  But a genius artist  And I'm like  He hated  And I mean hated 
[03:14:00]  Hated this guy  With a passion  Like  Just hated him  And you know  To see this guy  Tweeting  Give Jonathan a pen  I need to know  Guy trying to fucking  Guy trying to open his heart  But you know  It's a phony  Because if he fucking  If he really was  Felt the way he felt  He wouldn't have fucked  Patrice to begin with  He tried  I mean I  I can go in  Great to do  He tried to fuck him over  So hard  On this deal  And it was horrible  And we caught him  In the middle of it  And it was just awful  And he hated him  Did Patrice call him on it  Oh yeah 
[03:14:30]  Yeah he called him on it  In the room  Oh shit  Yeah that's Patrice  At the network  The executives got scared  Because they'd never seen him  Act that way  And this guy was shaking  Because he got in front of him  He got in front of his face  And he's like  You liar  You lied to me  You know  You revealed yourself  He loved that word  You revealed yourself to me  Oh yeah  And just to see this guy  Tweeting this yesterday  Was  A little vomit bag  It would make you puke  Yeah  But I think  I think he would have loved  I think he would have 
[03:15:00]  Appreciated the love  He was certainly  He was an emotional guy  He was a sensitive  He was an animal lover  Like little dumb dogs  Yeah that's something  That really is amazing  When you just saw  His sheer size and stuff  You'd be like  Hey it's a big black guy  Yeah  And then he's like  That one picture of him  Holding the kitten up  And he's making like  Googly eyes  At this little kitten  In his giant hand  It's fucking classic  It's like  Of mice and men  Yeah  Don't pet it  It's a reboot  Don't pet it  Motherfucker  That would have been 
[03:15:30]  A great reboot  But that's so Patrice  Right there  Except he wouldn't have  Accidentally killed the girl  He just would have  Talked to her  Until she killed herself  Who had told her  Why she was a worthless hoe  Yeah he loved his dog  And his dog is like  A small white  Little puppy  Yeah  Yeah yeah  Look at that shit  That's great  And he was going to  Do something for PETA too right  Yeah yeah  He was about to do  This PSA for PETA  And you know  We had it scheduled  And everything  And everything was 
[03:16:00]  Hitting on all cylinders  He was ready to fucking  Yeah I was going to say  Like what  Rip it to the next level  Obviously for fans  And just you know  What's in the  He's got an album  That we're going to release  Well the pre-orders  Are going to start very soon  It's called Mr. P  It's hard to listen to  Right now  For me  I mean it's just  It's brilliant  It's brilliant  He recorded it in DC  At the Improv  Different stuff  From Elephant  It's all new stuff  Oh I didn't know that  I didn't know it was good  From Elephant  It's all new material  That's what's amazing  Wow  And it's good  I mean really really good 
[03:16:30]  I think we're getting you guys  Some stuff  Iraq's saying we got the track  Can we play it  To end the show today  Do we have a track  From Mr. P  Yeah it's the one  Jonathan suggested  Okay  Oh yeah we play this today  Oh hell yeah  So this is going to be  One of the tracks  Off the new album  That people could  Pre-order real soon  I mean we'll give out  All the information  When you can get it  I didn't know that  We got people  To take care of man  Did he write anything  Was he writing anything  He was writing something  He also had a movie  That he did  It's funny  He like  He did the movie  With Jimmy  Furry Vengeance 
[03:17:00]  He was difficult at best  On that side  I was telling him yesterday  I was like the codependent wife  Trying to explain  Like he's just tired  Oh was he fucking miserable  When we did that movie  It's the only time  I ever had a casting director  Call me  Like after someone  Had been put in the movie  And they were shooting  And they're like  Look he's got to stop  Talking to the director  Oh no  Oh no  What happened  And then he was really upset  That the guy took it  The wrong way  He was just  You know they had one day 
[03:17:30]  Where they were just waiting  And waiting  Our first day  We hadn't met the director  We were sitting in the honey wagons  For hours  And you know  Two fucking assholes  Commiserating  Like I would look at his  Like what the fuck  He's like  You know  And both by the time  We got down to the set  A full fucking head of steam  Yeah  But I was just happy  To be there  And he made a really  Like sarcastic comment  To the guy  Oh no  You know it was real  Passive  He was like  How you doing buddy  Whoa what's going on  We're sitting around  I don't remember  Exactly what it was  But it was something like that  And then they called  And they're like  He can't talk to the director  Anymore  Unless he's spoken 
[03:18:00]  Fuck  I was like  Wow  You know what's a testament  To Patrice  Because you talk about  That movie a lot Jimmy  Is the fact that  He got along with  Brooke Shields  She loved him  Yeah  And it was her movie  It was her movie  He didn't want to be there  You guys were miserable  He obviously had a problem  With the director  Whatever  But in the end  Brooke Shields  Loved him  And he liked her too  Yeah  Because she came in here  And she was like  Patrice  You know  She was just  Gushing over him  He was  Sitting something  She was going to her trailer 
[03:18:30]  To eat lunch  And he said  Why  You don't want to eat lunch  With us  Like you know  And so she said  Okay  And then I guess she did  And she sat with you guys  And ate lunch  And yeah  There's that great photo of him  And really hit it off  There's a  I'm sorry  No no no  It's him and Brooke  She's got her fucking muscles  And Patrice is kind of standing  Oh I got a video  I got to show too  I think I played the audio  It's from one of those scenes  Where there was a hill  And Patrice was dressed  A construction worker  And he has to walk down the hill  But he slips in the mud 
[03:19:00]  And he crashes into the camera  And it's not that long of a video  But he just kind of  He just kind of fucking slips into it  And I watched it on a monitor  And I fucking howled  Watching this dummy  Slip into the fucking camera  Oh by the way  Mr. P is available  For pre-order on iTunes now  So go to iTunes now  And Amazon  I'll say it again  We got people to take care of  Yeah his family  We got people to take care of  So we got  All the money's going to go to them  We set it up  Yeah the DVD guys 
[03:19:30]  The CD people are doing the right thing  They actually restructured things  Just so Patrice's family  Would get more money  Literally after  This whole thing happened  You know  We didn't know it was going to happen  And they just said  Look we're going to change our deal  And they did something  Unbelievably generous  Wow  So yeah  That's great  It's really going to  You know  Because that was one thing  He cared about taking care of people  Like he really  You know his mom  Von  His stepdaughter  I mean  I had dinner with  Von and his stepdaughter  And you know  It's hard for them now 
[03:20:00]  I mean especially  His stepdaughter  She's just  But it's funny  I mean I think they were together  Like 10 years  And so she's 11  And I just didn't realize  The effect he had on her  Because her personality  Is really  It's amazing  And it's funny  And she's like  Questioning me about stuff  You know  And you know  You don't get that  From 11 year olds  Yeah  And it's amazing  I mean  You're in the middle of something  And she went  Shut up  Shut up  He's got  He's also got this movie  Coming out 
[03:20:30]  Called Scout Masters  And he was really  It's funny  Other than complaining  About the parking situation  On it  Every day  He actually loved  Doing the movie  God damn man  This was Rob Riegel right  Yeah  This was Rob Riegel  And Patton Oswalt  And the funny thing is  He'd be like  Yeah they're cool  I like Rob  And everything  This parking situation  We gotta deal with this  Cause I got it in his deal  That they would pay  For his parking  And you know  He was happy with that  Cause he wanted to drive  His truck in 
[03:21:00]  He didn't want to be picked up  And he'd drive my truck  And you know  So okay  I got you parking  Well what they did was  They were shooting the movie  In like Westchester  So he didn't  He realized he didn't  Want to drive to the set  He wanted to drive  Into Manhattan  Where like Rob Riegel  And go in the van  With him  So he had to park  His car in the city  And they were like  Well no  In the deal  His contract was to  Pay for parking  At the set  Not in the city  And so every day  Every single day  He was like  Man this $24  Is pissing me off 
[03:21:30]  Every day  And I'd be like  Yeah but you're having  A good time filming  Yeah that's cool  That's cool  But this fucking parking  Situation  We've got to work on it  He just  You know  But he liked filming that movie  He liked Riegel a lot  They had a good time together  Is there a buzz  In the movie  I don't  Yeah  From what I hear  I mean  Again you know  The producers  And this guy Todd Rohall  The director  Has told me  He's got like  The funniest scene  In the movie  And he had a really good time  In this movie  It's funny  Cause he  You know I know that  Cause he said to me  He goes  I think this could be funny  I think this could be pretty good 
[03:22:00]  Like for him  I was like  Free vengeance  He goes  Man this is a piece of garbage  This is just  You know  I was just  I was just remembering  I'm sure  You know  Jimmy you saw this  So many times  You could pretty much  Walking into  Whatever situation you were  Where Patrice was waiting  You could almost quickly assess  The level of  Whatever he was dealing with  Frustration  Or by how he was wearing his hat  Oh shit 
[03:22:30]  Yes  Depending on where the hat was placed  On his head  You knew that you were in for it  With Patrice  If it was  If it was kind of like  Back  And like  Kind of floppy  If it was that half  Down over one eye  It was like  Here we go  He's got a gripe  Yeah  That hat was a mood hat  It was lovely  I love that  I saw him move it a few times  Sure  Cause his mood was changing  He's being jovial hat  And then pull it down a little bit  Oh shit  When we did  When we did 
[03:23:00]  Elephant in the room  We had a big discussion  Cause he goes  I've graduated from  Baseball hat  To like a fedora now  And he didn't want to wear  Baseball hat  And we were worried  Because it was covering his face  You know  The shadow would be  Cast over his face  A little bit  Big argument about it  But he just  He didn't care  He'd be like  No  And then you'd see him  Wear it  Different styles  Throughout  You know  It's so true  To try to see  What would show his face  Yeah  But he would have  But also the mood  I mean that's  Literally  You nailed it  Yeah  The wool ones  He would wear sometimes  I remember  I'd come down  If it was right 
[03:23:30]  If it was right  On his brow  If he was  Back in a chair  If it was right  To where you could  Barely see his eyes  It was like  I didn't watch the news today  But I'm gonna know  In a few minutes  What's happening  Did you see this motherfucker  Putting sandbags  Did you ever hear him  I said it to you  In the elevator  When we were coming up  He hated the movie  The Town  Because  Because he was like  Man I grew up in Boston 
[03:24:00]  This is not Boston  And I'm like  Well it's not your Boston  He goes  Fuck man  This is the only Boston  People are gonna know  He was really pissed about it  Yeah  He was like  He had this thing  But he's like  There's other people  From Boston  Dane's from Boston  This is not his Boston either  And I went  Alright  You know  I liked the movie  What can I say  He made me feel  Really bad  For liking  For liking a movie  Made me feel really awful  For liking it  Yeah  I liked the movie  Yeah  He did not  He hated it  God damn  He had a really  Nobody ever wondered 
[03:24:30]  Like  I wonder what Patrice  Thinks of me  Like no one has ever  Said those words  You knew immediately  How he felt about you  Like that's the beauty of him  Is that you could never  He was a bad  I'm sure he had to do  Poker face once in a while  Barely  He was terrible at hiding  That stuff  Barely  He was terrible at hiding  Dislike or  Displeasure  Or lack of respect  Horrible poker player  Couldn't fucking hide it man  He  Sometimes he just loved  Saying it  Like there was  I remember when I  I broke up  I broke up with my chick 
[03:25:00]  And  He was like  Yo you broke up with that girl  I'm like yeah yeah  He goes  Oh so  I don't have to be nice  To her anymore  He had a great sigh  Patrice's sigh  Was wonderfully like  What  Just let me have it  My favorite thing he did  On one of them  Was when he would  Shush people  Did you ever hear him  Shush people  Oh yeah  He was  Oh yes  It's so loud  He literally  Shhh  Those big fucking teeth 
[03:25:30]  He shushed  He shut  Keith Robinson  Went to see something  At Carnegie Hall  With him  And he shushed  And fucking literally  Hundreds of people  Stopped talking  He had the ability  To just be heard  Shhh  But a lot of times  He would do it  And no one knew  Where it was coming from  No they never knew  And that was the beauty of it  They would just turn around  And see this lummux  They're looking around  Like who the fuck  Who the fuck  Just shushed us  Dane has to go  He's got TV  Yeah  But just so you know  Oh god  What's the name of the movie

[03:33:30]  Start to get back  On track today  Starting to  You know  Rebuild  And get back  To where we were  It's very difficult  When you're doing  A comedy show  Or even if  You know  A general  Entertainment show  And you have to  Deal with  With the loss  Of somebody  Who was so  Important to that  Show  To come back  And just  You know  Pick up  Like you were  The day before  Because everything's  Changed  And you know  Overnight  In the blink of  An eye  Everything's  Different  But you know 
[03:34:00]  We're processing  Everything  And it's great  To see the fans  And hear the audience  Kind of working  Through this with us  You know what I mean  Yesterday's show  Was just  Incredible  The amount of  People that came  In here  And showed love  For Patrice  You know  You had  I mean in hindsight  And they were  Running it on  Raw Dog  Comedy  All day  Yesterday  It was  You know  Louis C.K  You had  Bill Burr call in  Rich Voss call in 
[03:34:30]  Joe Rogan call in  Colin Quinn was in here  Amy Schumer was in here  I mean these  Like  Just A-list  Comedians  That were just  Coming in  And thanking us  For the privilege  Of getting to do it  Which I mean  It was amazing to see  And then today  It was great to hear  From Big Jay Oakerson  Who's been on the show  Before  Talking about  What's going on  And Dane Cook  Was just great  I mean  Honestly  It was timing  You know  Dane Cook  Was going to come in  Regardless  To talk about his movie  But  It was great  Not only  To hear the perspective 
[03:35:00]  Of Dane  Who  Worked with Patrice  So early on  And to hear  Dane's stories  About  A young Patrice  Trying to figure out  What's going to work  On stage  And not sure of himself  Just I mean  Amazing to put the guy  That we know  As this you know  Huge larger than life  Personality  Into that perspective  And then to also  You know  Have  Somebody on Dane's level  Honestly 
[03:35:30]  Be grateful  Because this is what  He wanted to talk about  You know  It's got to be difficult  For Dane  To be going on  This press tour  Like he was talking about  For this movie  Which I'm sure he's proud of  But  You know  All they want to do  All Dane wants to do  Is talk about  The loss of his good friend  Which I'm glad that  We provided him that today  And that he provided to us  Not only the show  But to the listeners  The perspective  And  And we got to see  Even more  Of what an effect  Patrice had on people 
[03:36:00]  It's so cool  I mean  When I  I found out last night  Because an email went around  But when  When we found out  That there is more  Patrice material  Coming out  So cool  The album  Mr. P  Is Patrice's new  Stand up comedy album  It's a CD  It's not a DVD  Right Eric  It's just the CD  Yeah it's a CD  And it's all new material  Okay it's not  He did Elephant in the Room  Which I thought would be  You know  His final work  And the work that really 
[03:36:30]  This is the hour  That represents  Patrice  But to find out  That he's got another  Hour  And I obviously  Haven't heard it  But from what Jonathan said  He said it could be his best  And to come  Back  After Elephant in the Room  Which just blew  Everybody's minds  To come off  Of Elephant in the Room  And to come up  With an hour  That's  As good if not better  Is just amazing  But it's not really surprising  When we think about 
[03:37:00]  How great Patrice was at this  So the album is called  Mr. P  You heard a track off of it  When the show ended  Just a minute ago  Before the break  It was called  I Hate People Touching Me  Right  And you know  I mean we're not all ready  To dive into Patrice material  Everybody's dealing  With this stuff differently  But the album will come out  On February 28th  February  Right  Isn't it  February 7th  Oh great  Even sooner  So it'll be out in February  Early February  Is when the album  Officially comes out  But pre-orders are up now  On Amazon and iTunes 
[03:37:30]  So definitely  Buy this album  Like Jonathan  Jonathan is  Jim and Patrice's manager  He was in here  He's been on the show  Before talking about  His travels  Hopefully  We got a little of that  With Jason Ellis  In here today too  Hopefully Jonathan  Will be back either  Tomorrow or next week  Because his stories are  I mean unbelievable  That anybody  Not only the things  That he's seen  But that anybody  Would do this  That anybody would  Travel to these places  Is beyond my comprehension  But at the same time 
[03:38:00]  You're talking to a guy  That won't try red meat  So I'm not exactly  An adventurous person  But definitely buy  This Patrice album  Because Jonathan  Told us that  The record people  Had made this  Had changed the deal  Completely  After Patrice's passing  And that Patrice's family  Is going to  Get so much  Of this money  From the album  And that's what's  Really important  To support  Patrice's family  Because  Like I think  It was Dane  Or Jonathan  That said  Patrice was a guy 
[03:38:30]  Who really wanted  To take care of people  And that was something  That was really important  To him  Jimmy  In Staten Island  You're on  After Open Anthony Live  Sam  Last night  Because I'm at the show  This morning  It's not my car  Yeah  I set it up  To watch  Health in the Room  On County Central  Yeah it was on  It was fucking awesome  And at the end  They did something  Very very painful  You know  They're respectful  They put in memory  Of Patrice  You know  And I had to hear it yesterday  How he told off 
[03:39:00]  Everybody  To Comedy Central  About 5 minutes  And shit like that  Yeah  It was just cool  How they just turned around  And said  He was awesome  Value of a white woman  Cheating  Just shit like that  Did you  Did you watch  The uncensored version  That was on later  Yeah  That's great  I stayed up late  That's awesome  Well yeah  And I would definitely  Because that's going to be  Something  Like I said  Like that  I mean  We have the album  Coming out in February  But that's the last  As far as I know  That'll be the last  DVD 
[03:39:30]  I think that was  The last thing  That was taped  The last special  That was taped  So I would definitely  Recommend Jimmy  You and everybody  Go out there  And buy the DVD  Just so you have it  Always  And because  You know  The money from that  Will go to support  The family as well  Sam  When I used to  You know  I used to  The show  And Patrice was on  Yeah  I'd drop it in my car  He did  He's so infuriated  You know  The shit he was stealing  But he had a point  You know  That's what I loved about him  And that's the thing too  It's like  With entertainers  Like a lot of people  Didn't agree with Patrice 
[03:40:00]  But the fact is  That there was  Everybody  Had an opinion  On the guy  And so many  There are comedians  That come in here  And you  They do their thing  And they're fine  But you leave  Yeah you gotta chuckle  But it's very  Eh  They have no effect  On you whatsoever  And that's the worst  Place that you can be  As far as  Entertaining people  Just  Leaving  With people  Not having an opinion  On you  One way or the other  Is the absolute  Worst place you can be  And whether you  Loved  Patrice  Or he infuriated you 
[03:40:30]  You had an opinion  On him  And you know  He was  He was in your mind  Like he never  You know what I mean  Yeah  He was awesome  Yeah  He was awesome  I'm gonna miss him man  I was upset man  But  I was in the room  He's gonna be a lot  Forever now  Yeah man  Thanks a lot Jimmy  Watch it out  So yeah  Definitely  Check that out  And it was cool  To hear from Dane Cook  Dane Cook  I mean  I was thinking  About this last night  When I was thinking  About how he came up  With Patrice and everything  Like as big 
[03:41:00]  As Dane Cook  Is  And was  Like Dane Cook  Is a superstar  He's an A-lister  There's very few people  In comedy  That have done  And are continuing  To do what Dane Cook  Has done  And does  I mean  Like Opie was talking about  Going to see him  At the Boston Garden  Playing in front of  19,000 people  And then when you leave  Having a line  Of people  Waiting to see  The second show  Two shows  Back to back  At the Boston Garden  That's 40,000 people 
[03:41:30]  In one night  And both are sold out  Lord knows  How many tickets  He could have sold  If it was unlimited  But Dane Cook  I mean  It's just  So cool  That he comes in here  He talks about  Patrice  With a genuineness  He puts  Bob Kelly  On his show  On Tourgasm  You know  That's where the  I broke my knee man  Came from  Was Tourgasm  Dane Cook  Has absolutely  Not forgotten  Where he came from  And I mean  Like you said  He took a year off  And he was just  Hanging out with family 
[03:42:00]  And stuff  But it's just  Because a lot of people  You know  They get to that level  And it's hard  To see below you  When you're up that high  If I can use  That expression  That's not an expression  I just made it up  It's words  That I threw together  I'm not the most  Intelligent person  But  You know  He's not forgotten  Where he came from  And it's very cool  To see somebody  With that  With that perspective  On things  That's so in touch  With his roots  What's up Adam  You're on  After Opie and Anthony Live  Hey guy 
[03:42:30]  I'm just kind of curious  Like I won't  I got  Satellite in my  Work truck  But I don't have it  You know  Outside of work  Yet  But the  Patrice special  You guys are going  To do this weekend  Is that something  You guys can put  On a disc  And sell  To raise money  For the family  I don't know  What the ownership  And stuff is  For stuff like that  I mean I know  That this is going  To be more than  A special  We're doing  A tribute to Patrice  All weekend  On this channel  And this  I mean  It started as just  Doing like a regular  Worst stuff special  Or whatever  But worst of the week  Countdown 
[03:43:00]  That we do  Is like  I think it's a  Four hour show  That repeats  Throughout the weekend  We're blowing  Everything out  This weekend  And it's going  To be all  Patrice  It's not even  It's not so much  A special  As we're turning  This into  A Patrice channel  Like when they  When they've turned  Other stuff  Here on SiriusXM  Into pop-up channels  Is what they call them  Like Charlie Sheen  Had a channel  For a weekend  And so and so  Metallica gets a channel  For a week  Or whatever  And they turn  We're turning this  Into an all-out  Patrice channel 
[03:43:30]  So it's more than  Just  Something  It would be  A box set  If we put it out  At all  And I don't know  I don't know  What the ownership  Issues are with it  That's the only  That's the only  Hang up  But in the meantime  I would say  Just you know  Everything  Anything  I would think  Anything that Patrice  Would make a profit on  So in terms of  Buying his CDs  And DVDs  Because a lot of  People are asking  Anything that Patrice  Would make a profit on  Now that money  Will go to his family  So if you know  What I mean  If you want to  Support his family  Pre-order the album 
[03:44:00]  And it'd be cool  I'm seeing somebody  On Feedback says  That Mr. P  Is already the number  Three album  On iTunes comedy  So I mean  It'd be pretty sweet  If we could all  You know  Get that up  And because getting  On the top ten  Of iTunes  Is only going to make  More people aware of it  And just get the pre-orders in  Because it's only good  For the family  But if you want to  Yeah  If you want to  Support the family  I would definitely say  That's the way to do it  And you know  Listen all weekend  Because we're going to have  The Patrice Unmasked  Is going to be part of this  We're going to have  Clips from yesterday's show 
[03:44:30]  We're not airing  The full yesterday's show  Right Eric?  No it's just going to  It'll be  Long for  You're going to get  The gist of everything  That happened yesterday  But you're going to get  Some  Some shorter versions  Of all the discussions  About Patrice  From yesterday  Can you get all his  Can you get all his  Merchandise at his website  Then too?  I don't know  Yeah I don't know  What he's got for sale  On his website right now  I don't know  Everything about it  But yeah  Just buy Patrice stuff  If you want to support  Because we're going to do 
[03:45:00]  A ton of Patrice bits  We're going to  Throw in  Bits from  Yesterday's show  We're going to have  The Patrice Unmasked  As part of it  I mean every  I would assume  Black Phillip will be in there  Yeah we're going to have  Clips from the Black Phillip show  People have been  Twittering me about that  Yes  Clips from Patrice  Doing the Black Phillip show  Will be in there  I think we're going to  Try to squeeze in  Some clips  I don't know how many  Of you remember this  But when we were doing  When we were on  K-Rock and XM  Patrice came in  For two days  That Opie and Anthony  Were off 
[03:45:30]  And did the show  By himself  He hosted the  Opie and Anthony show  On his own  We're going to  I think we're going to  Throw in some bits  From that  We're going to have  I mean everything  You know the full  Full bits  The full thing  Of Rock Code  And Calmo  And the Glass Dildos  And the Independence Day Review  And I mean  I'm not speaking  Dinosaur Forest  Dinosaur Forest  Everything  What about Cheetah Heels?  You've got to do the Cheetah Heels  Cheetah Heels Eric?  Yeah that's in there too  I'm telling you  This thing  It's not like  You're not going to be able 
[03:46:00]  To sit down and listen  To the full special  That's how long it is  I mean we're not even  We don't even know  What the length is  But I'm  Without exaggeration  Okay  Over 12 hours  Of material  Awesome  What you guys are doing  Is amazing  So awesome show  Yesterday and today  Thanks a lot Adam  Yeah  Yeah so it's  It's cool  And we're  You know  Somebody's  You know  People are  Calling in and stuff  With bits and everything  That they want to hear  I mean  Everything you can think of 
[03:46:30]  Look  For  Because I saw it on Twitter too  And everything  I put up something  On the Facebook yesterday  Facebook.com  Slash Opie and Anthony  If there's something  That maybe  That fell through the cracks  That we're not thinking of  You know  You can  There's a column up there  You can give us your suggestions  But as far as all the major stuff  That everyone's been requesting  And the stuff that we reference  All the time  It's already included  So you don't have to worry about  It's all there  The thing about Patrice  Is that he was so good  On this show  That like  Yesterday  Or two days ago 
[03:47:00]  When it came time  To finding all the Patrice bits  So that we could have  Something like this  Ready to go  It took no time  Because usually  We'll have to go back  Into shows  And find bits  And isolate them  So we can make a proper tribute  Or whatever  But every  Almost  Almost  Everything that Patrice did  In this studio  The day of  Yeah  We isolated it for worst of  And immediately put it  Into the worst of library  There was no obscure material  From Patrice  Right  Everything 
[03:47:30]  Every time he was here  And it's like  Well that segment's  Worst of  That segment's  Worst of  And this is  The difference  Between Patrice  And other people  That like  Other people  You're like  Yeah we really should  Do a tribute  Or yeah  We should try to  Throw something together  Blah blah blah  I mean  We've got  So  We could do a week  On Patrice  And without even trying  Alright  We don't have to  Dig through stuff  To find it  It's all there  I mean  We would have  We would have  Wanted to run this  Patrice channel 
[03:48:00]  Takeover  Regardless  The fact that  There's a reason now  You know  It's a horrible reason  But I'm glad  That we get to run it  I'll be tuned in  To the radio  All weekend  And I wanted to give you  You know  Before  While we're still  Doing Patrice stuff  I want to talk about  A couple other things  Because you know  Like I said  We want to  Keep moving past this  As much as  You know  All of it  It's at the front  Of our minds  We want to keep  Moving on  But I did want to  Play for everybody  A little taste 
[03:48:30]  Of Patrice  And the Gallagher  Confrontation  Because I love this  Moment  Because it really was  Patrice wasn't a guy  Who would sit next to you  Have a problem with you  And you wouldn't know it  Like  Gallagher was in here  And Patrice was in here  And Patrice wanted to  Address something with  Gallagher that would have  Been uncomfortable  Uncomfortable  For anyone else  And it made the  Entire room uncomfortable  But for Patrice  That was what was  Honest  That was what was  Truly going on 
[03:49:00]  And so he said  This is what we're  Going to do  We're going to go here  This is what  This is what  I want to talk about  And this is when  He accused  Gallagher of racism  Correct Iraq  He accused Leo  Of racism  And he refused  He refused to go  With this gimmick  And call him Gallagher  It's the last time  Gallagher was on our show  We had started to build up  A little bit of a relationship  Between this show  And Gallagher  Well  He had come  I think this was like  His third appearance  Well what happened was  This appearance  Gallagher came in 
[03:49:30]  Two days  No not two days in a row  But two days that week  The first day he was in  We had this whole  Studio set up  Like a kill room  With plastic  So he could smash stuff  Then he was going to  Come back two days later  And that was the day  Patrice was here  And we've never seen  Gallagher again  Never again  As a matter of fact  After Gallagher  Had heart problems  Or whatever it was  I don't remember  Roland called him  Like a week later  And he was shopping  In a Walmart  He was in Walmart  And Roland goes  Hey Gallagher  The guys want to talk to you 
[03:50:00]  And in the middle of  Shopping at Walmart  Gallagher screams  You guys are going to  Kill me  You have to leave me alone  Because of what  Because  I think  And that's the thing  Because guys like Gallagher  Are real to an extent  They're telling you the truth  To an extent  But they're keeping  Themselves protected  They're not being  Completely revealing  Don't question them on it  Yeah  They're not being  Completely revealing  And they don't want  To be questioned 
[03:50:30]  On what they're not revealing  This is something  That would not  Fly for Patrice  Gallagher's big worry  Was that he was going to  And he said this  In one of the interviews  That you'll never get booked  At county and state fairs  By talking that way  Yeah  And he was concerned  That Patrice kept  Calling him Leo  It really was  I mean it was an awesome thing  This was even  Like it was a big secret  This is  I remember  A month ago  I had to share  I was on Who Kids show  And I had to share  This entire thing  That happened  Because Carrot Top was in 
[03:51:00]  And we all know  About the  The Gallagher  Carrot Top  Prop comic war  Gallagher believes that  Any prop comic  Has stolen Gallagher's gimmick  So  I explained this whole thing  To Carrot Top  I mean  It's just one of those stories  That just sticks with you  So  Here it is  It's just a taste  And the full thing  The full confrontation  Will be part of our  Patrice weekend tribute  It's such an obscure bit  Yeah  Completely obscure  No one ever thinks of this  It's Patrice and Gallagher 
[03:51:30]  Or Leo  As he called him  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live  After Opie and Anthony Live  But hold on  Let's get into this  Gallagher feels like  He has to make a statement  I think he doesn't like us  I don't think he's coming back  Nigger farts are  Contributing to global warming  Jesus Patrice  Gallagher's going to  I think black people  Have more gas  Than most  Let Gallagher explain  He felt like he was in a spot  From his diet  Here's a  All those pork chops  Are stinking up to earth  Right Gallagher?  Leo  I do a fart 
[03:52:00]  I do a fart joke  But I do a different one  Why don't little girls  How many of us  Do a fart joke  I want to know  How many light bulbs  How many of me  It takes to screw  In a fucking light bulb  Let him do his fart joke  I'm sorry  Go ahead  I'm sorry  I apologize  I'm trying to get back  On his good side  He fucking is giving me  The daggers right now  Go ahead Gallagher  Why don't little girls fart  Because they don't get assholes  Until they get married  Now this gets all the girls  Yeah the girls love that 
[03:52:30]  Yes they do  And the guys are like  It's a good fart joke  Instead of just saying  What you said  How about this  Wait but how about this  How about this joke  About girls  Yeah  My girlfriend has been  With me for eight years  I've been with her for three  Gallagher  He's thinking  How's that one  I guess that's what  Black people do  Oh shit  Oh shit  Told you  This  No  He's mad at me  Because I asked a question  I like it  I think his real name  Is Gala Nigger 
[03:53:00]  I like this Gallagher  Gallagher's mad  This is the true Leo  But he's mad at me  Because I asked  That question  Before break  Here's why  Here's why he's upset  Because he knows  Fuck that  He is the Hulk  And you brought in  The thing that makes him change  He's a wolf man  And you brought a full moon in  He said my mom  Fucked the Viking  Well imagine what he thinks  My mom fucked  At least it has king in it 
[03:53:30]  Yours mine  Jesus Christ  Yours has king in it too  I don't want Gallagher leaving  And never coming back  So Gallagher  Why was that question bad?  Well I guess you'll have  Either an Oriental 
[03:54:00]  Or a gay comic  On next time  And I'll have to deal with that  Oh shit  We talk race all the time  In this show  We do  We do talk a lot about race  I didn't know  I was on two days ago  And we didn't discuss it  No because it's not  An everyday thing  We kind of just  We're all over the place  But it's  Race only comes up  Every other day  It's whatever  It's a very kind of  Whatever the world  Is talking about thing  And in this day and age  Political correctness  Is like really a big thing  And we talk about that  We talk about sex  We talk about toilet habits  We'll talk about anything  But race 
[03:54:30]  Race is kind of a big thing  Especially in this day and age  With Obama being president  It was a big issue  There was a  There was a report  A little story  About Jimmy the Greek  On during the football  Oh yeah yeah  We did  Did you flick around  We did Jimmy the Greek  Did you flick around  I was interested  In what the networks  Played against that game  Trying to get attention  Because they did  The Bourne  Whatever it is  Odyssey or whatever  Yeah there's like  Three or four of them  Bourne Identity  They did that  I love that movie  I watch it every time 
[03:55:00]  Yeah yeah  So I watched that  And the football game  It was kind of a pitiful game  I didn't watch the football game  No  Well I wanted to know  Who won  I like crime shows  I saw him get hit in the back  But it didn't look like  It hurt him that bad  His arm went to sleep  It had to hurt though right  No it was just a little hit  It was just a little hit  But I guess they put him out  They could have had that  As a strategy  We're not going to come back  From what happened  Before the break huh  I was just looking at Sam's hair  Yeah Sam's hair by the way  The bit's over 
[03:55:30]  And we got nothing accomplished  It's a cross between  Frederick Douglass  It actually looks like  Adolf Hitler  It does  A little but  Yeah hey  There you go  Oh shit  Really  No blacks or Jews  At my show  Oh no  You do have a very  Specific demographic  To your audience  I noticed that too  Yeah smart  Yeah okay  That's one way  To put it 
[03:56:00]  Patrice isn't talking  It is funny  Watching the guys  With the dry look  From Gillette hair  And the big 70's  Porno mustaches  And stuff  I think it's interesting  To look at the audience  When you go there  And go wow  People come up to me  And they say  We were stoned  When we watched your show  And I said  I was too  And that's where  The jokes came from  If your knees  Bent the other way  What would a chair look like  What makes Teflon  Stick to the pan  So no more French people  At your shows now  No more French words  In my mouth  You can't go out  To eat without  Speaking French 
[03:56:30]  There's a restaurant  A buffet  A cafe  A cabaret  There's a valet  There's a maitre d'  You can order a la carte  Or get the soup du jour  I start every day  With a latte and a croissant  And I don't like it  That's a Carlin thing  Right there  It's French  Good stuff  It's an observation  That's why I said Carlin  He was the king  Of the observation  Well people don't realize  That  What about Africa  There's a  Oh wow  I'm just asking about Africa  You asked about China  And fucking France  I'm just saying  That's a continent  Not a country  That's right  How about fucking Nigeria 
[03:57:00]  Oh we all hate that place  What's their major export  I hate Nigeria too  Scams  And the emails  About how they've got some money  They need to get out of the bank  And can you help them  That's what I just said  Yeah  Why are you getting mad  I don't know  I guess it wasn't clear  Leave him alone man  It wasn't clear  Alright  How are we going to get everyone  On the same page again Gallagher  We're on the same page  If Gallagher just stop his racism  For four seconds  Wow  We can love each other  Now Gallagher that was amazing  Oh shit  Giving you  I've never seen a look like that 
[03:57:30]  After ONA  Live  He was just a genius  I mean  Nothing funnier  It's Sam Robertson  After Opie and Anthony Live  There's no  I was laughing in here  And I was in the room  When it happened  The tension  That he caused  And just  Just bathing in it  Did you hear him  Just laughing off mic  The whole time  Gallagher was furious  At this whole thing  But you know what  It's probably because  Gallagher was a bit of a racist  Patrice is 
[03:58:00]  It's the only thing  I want to talk  It's the only thing  I want to talk about  But I also  I don't want to  Seg into it  But I also have to talk  About Argentium  I guess you all know that  Don't you  Argentium  What is Argentium  Does anybody know  Of course  Everybody knows  At this point  We've been talking  About it for a month  Argentium is  Steven Singer's  New super silver collection  That's right  Steven Singer's  Brand new collection  Of silver  Is made from  Argentium  The king  Of all silver metals  Look  Get the  What was that  Wrong one  Sorry 
[03:58:30]  Steven Singer's  Going to be really mad  That was Eric  The sex man  Nagel  Steven Singer  He's trying to  Wrap me up  With the super  Mario music  Steven Singer  Is no video game  Character  He's a super  Man  He's a man  Of steel  He's a man  Of silver  He's a man  Of Argentium  Check out  The Argentium  Collection now  It's over at  IHateStevenSinger.com  You can visit him  In person  I always do  On the other corner  Of 8th and Walnut  Listen  Jason Ellis  Was making fun of me  Earlier on the show  For getting married  Well let me tell you 
[03:59:00]  I got my engagement ring  From Steven Singer  And  Wedding bands  For Sam Roberts  And Jessica  Are on their way  To  My  House  From Steven Singer  We talked on the show  About how little money  I have  I'm a fucking  Dishwasher  For God's sake  If I can afford  Steven Singer  And get something  Nice from him  If he can make it  Happen for me  He can make it  Happen for you  Go to  IHateStevenSinger.com 
[03:59:30]  Or you can order  By phone  At 1-888  IHateStevenSinger  The other corner  Not that corner  The other corner  Of 8th and Walnut  In Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  That's IHateStevenSinger  And IHateStevenSinger.com  Eric you said in my ear today  When Jason Ellis  Was on the show  Yeah  That you thought  His remarks about me  Not being the wealthiest  Of persons  Was unnecessary  Yeah  Well it's kind of like  What you do to me  And anybody else  Where you just throw 
[04:00:00]  Some really unnecessary  Hurtful comment out  Just because you know  Hey things are flying around  I'll throw it out there  And see what sticks  He's right though  Ellis was right  You are a piece of shit  Dishwasher yes  No he didn't say  Piece of shit  Did he  Yeah I think so  Well if you don't have  If not I'm embellishing  Okay well that's  Unnecessary then to me  But yeah  Ellis was on  He was talking about  It was interesting  To have Ellis on  And I'll tell you why  Because Jim  We all know and love Jim  He's talked about  His sex addiction  On the show forever 
[04:00:30]  And just the constant  Masturbation  And the prostitutes  And the drinking  Of urine  And the massages  And the this  And the that  And the  Listen  If you were listening  To the show  I think it was last week  If it wasn't the beginning  Of this show  I think it was last week  If you were listening  To the show last week  You know  I was sitting in the car  Driving home from  Harrisburg Pennsylvania  With Jim  While he was dirty texting  The whole time  We know  He's a sex addict  What was interesting  Was Jason Ellis  Coming in here  Because Jason Ellis  Also says that 
[04:01:00]  He is a sex addict  Has just recently  Realized this though  He and his wife  Had broken up  He said  He realizes  Now he's a sex addict  So it was very interesting  Listening to somebody  Come to terms with this  When it's a condition  That we all know  Very well  Through Mr. Norton  Jim  Is every day  Trying to incorporate it  Into his life  When Ellis said  That he was finally  Allowed to jerk off  His therapist  Has said 
[04:01:30]  Okay you can start  Jerking off again  All I could think about  Was how quickly  The downfall  Into Norton territory  Will go  To the point  Where Ellis  Is jerking off  Literally six times a day  And getting nothing  Else accomplished  Who knows  What's going to happen  With Ellis  But I think he was  Trying to inspire  People today  When he said  He was going to  Go down to the  Boss's office  When his contract  Expires  And he was going to  Demand a million dollars  I mean  And then he had to  Bring  I mean the fact that  Jason Ellis  Gets to go down  And demand a million dollars 
[04:02:00]  And then  You should do that  When O&A's contract ends  Well here's what  I was thinking  Because Ellis brought up  The fact that  I have no money  Opie decided to bring up  The fact that  I invited him  Into my home  And his observation  Was that I have  Two shitty TVs  Which is very nice  On his part  But I think  I don't think  I can demand  A million dollars yet  I don't think  I'm on that level  But I think  No no no  You could demand  A million dollars  I could make the demand  You could  Yeah  I mean what's 
[04:02:30]  Going to stop me  I have vocal cords  Exactly  There's nothing  That would stop me  But I think  Realistically  Okay  I'm at the point now  Where after  Opie and Anthony Live  Is bringing in revenue  For the company  Because let me tell you  Something  All those times  I talk about Argentium  All those times  I'm talking about  Using rubbers  And what not  I'm not doing that  For free folks  What?  That's right  You're getting paid?  No that's also incorrect  But  What I'm telling you is  Whoops  This show  After Opie and Anthony Live  Is bringing in 
[04:03:00]  Revenue  For Sirius XM  Okay  Oh that's good  I've built  An audience  And continue to build  An audience  For after Opie and Anthony Live  Ronnefez intern  Don't remember your name  You don't even have to  Tell me what it is  Because I'll only forget it again  But you have to agree  With me on this  I have built  And continue to build  An audience  For after Opie and Anthony Live  Well you wrote me in  As far as I'm concerned  I listen to you every day  Every day I'm not here  I listen to you  I click you on every day  And you used to turn off  When we played Worst of  Didn't you  Oh yeah  I was one of those guys 
[04:03:30]  You know I was one of those guys  You've heard it before  You're either one of those guys  You're not one of those guys  I was  And I've heard  People come up to me  When I go to events  Where fans are  Whether it's one of our  Hard Rock events  Or whether I'm going to  Eastside Dave's birthday party  Or whatever it is  When there are listeners  Or there are just random people  Coming up to me on the street  Okay  I go to the Palisades Mall  And every time I'm there  Somebody's coming up to me  And telling me something  About this show  And what they're saying is  Sam  I used to listen  And turn it right off  As soon as I heard your voice  Which I mean I don't know why 
[04:04:00]  I do that  What do you mean you do that  I didn't hear a word you said  I just turned on  And you happened to be on  I need you to listen  To the whole show Eric  You're supposed to be  The producer here  I know you're not busy  Okay  You're just looking at menus  That's not being busy  See what I did there  I hear your water bottle crinkling  You son of a bitch  But what they tell me is  I used to listen to the show  And just turn it off  As soon as I heard your voice  Which again  I mean that's no way  To start a conversation 
[04:04:30]  But  The point is  The way the conversation finishes is  Now  Sam Roberts  You have me roped in  Now  I listen to  After Opie and Anthony Live  I wouldn't  If it were of  A lesser quality  So you're dealing with a person  Sam Roberts  Who now  Is bringing in money  And listeners  To a spot  Where there otherwise would be  No money or listeners  Am I right Eric  Eric  What I wasn't listening  Come on dude  I'm making a point  You're still on  I thought we were waiting 
[04:05:00]  For Ron and Fez  No we're not waiting  For Ron and Fez  We're providing entertainment  Before Ron and Fez  So what I'm going to do  Is provide entertainment  I've already been doing that Eric  I wasn't listening  I understand that  Just listen  Listen  And you'll hear the entertainment  Coming through my mouth  Into the microphone  And out all these  Good people's radios  I would say  Out their radios  Or internets  But the app so rarely works  That I'm assuming  Everybody's listening  On their radios  Now  What I'm saying is  If Ellis can go down there  And say  I want a million dollars 
[04:05:30]  To re-sign with this company  I don't have a contract  To do after  Open Anthony Live  You know this by now  What I'm going to do  Is I'm going to go down  And I'm going to march  Right into the boss's office  And I'm going to say  If you want me  To do another year  Of after Open Anthony Live  I want a contract  And I want  One  Thousand dollars  One thousand dollars  Eric  A year of after Open Anthony Live  And I want a grand 
[04:06:00]  And who's going to stop me  Jason Ellis has inspired me  To go after what I deserve  I am going to go into that boss's office  And I'm going to demand  Four figures  One  And three zeros  No decimal places  Maybe a comma  Depending on how you write it  One thousand dollars  And I don't think that's too much to ask  I think I can accomplish it  Because I was listening to Jason Ellis  He's going to ask for a million  But let me tell you Jason Ellis 
[04:06:30]  You might end up  With nine hundred  Ninety-nine thousand  Whatever it is  Nine hundred  Whatever  Whatever  I don't know all the math  Right off the top of my head  Nine hundred  Ninety-eight  Whatever  A thousand dollars  Less than a million  Because  A thousand of that  Is going to go to me  Did you hear this rolling?  I'm putting down the gauntlet  At some point  I'm going to go  And I'm going to demand  A thousand dollars  From the bosses  What do you think?
