<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with highly vulgar and sexually explicit jokes from the hosts, with Opie notably absent due to pre-planned time off.  Bobby Kelly was a guest in the studio.  A significant portion of the show focused on Jim Florentine's experiences with the recent birth of his child, including graphic details of his wife's labor and delivery, his anxieties, humorous anecdotes about hospital staff, and his plans to move to the suburbs.  This segment also included a tangent about Florentine and Sam Roberts' encounter with Gene Wilder.  The conversation frequently devolved into extremely vulgar and profane language.

The show then shifted to Bobby Kelly's experiences with his newborn daughter, featuring graphic details about baby care, including diaper changes, circumcision, and breastfeeding.  The hosts discussed the challenges and surprising aspects of newborn care, the exhaustion, and the intense bonding experience.  A humorous segment involved their struggle to describe a baby's testicles using absurd comparisons, and a bizarre voicemail from "Chip" offering inappropriate advice to Bobby's wife during labor was played.  A MyPillow live read was included, and Donald Sutherland was mentioned as a previous guest.  Jim Florentine was a recurring topic.  The hosts discussed their upcoming appearances at the Just for Laughs comedy festival, detailing past experiences and making plans for future shows.  A call-in portion followed, tackling topics such as the veracity of stories told by previous guests like Scott Thorson (who had a relationship with Liberace), and a listener challenged the hostsâ€™ claim about the existence of hermaphrodites, sparking a discussion on their rarity.

A studio guest, Jimmy, contributed extensively to a segment largely revolving around sex, relationships, and the porn industry.  He expressed his respect for porn actors, highlighting the profession's demanding nature, while also criticizing some actresses he deemed "cunty."  The conversation touched on the popularity of pornography, the appeal of Bailey Jay, and the honesty needed for success on the show. Bobby shared his initial reaction to seeing his daughter's head during birth, comparing it to a Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker moment, and reflected on the accessibility of birth videos and photos for children today.  Callers shared various experiences, including graphic childbirth details, childhood bullying, Asperger's Syndrome, and weight loss strategies.  An awkward interaction between Anthony and a previous guest, Brewer, was also discussed.  The show concluded with promotions for various events, including Bobby's new Travel Channel pilot, interspersed with discussions about Black Sabbath's new album and further off-color jokes and banter.

The show continued with a series of listener calls addressing relationship and sexual issues.  One caller sought advice on a woman dating someone else, while another detailed his affair with a pregnant 24-year-old model.  A humorous, fabricated story about a Las Vegas billboard featuring one of the hosts was shared. Phil, a guest, recounted a funny anecdote about their appearance on Amy Schumer's show, including wardrobe malfunctions.  Other callers discussed a sex addiction, issues with orgasm, and an ex-stepdaughter expressing sexual interest.  A recently widowed woman sought advice on casual dating.  The hosts provided blunt and often crude advice throughout.  A mock interview with Kim Kardashian was also briefly included.  The show frequently employed profanity and sexually explicit language.

Finally, the broadcast heavily promoted Roland's upcoming "Food Court" show. The hosts discussed the chaotic production, including absent interns, a missing bartender, and the guest list featuring Jay Orseski, a burger expert, Robert Irvine (who called in), a Nashville pitmaster, and the potential appearance of Guy Fieri. The format was described as loosely structured, potentially resulting in a "train wreck." Sam Roberts fielded listener calls, some critical, some supportive, and some involving merchandise requests or unsolicited career advice.  The conversation repeatedly circled back to the "Food Court" show, its potential success, and Roland's preparation, mentioning a future, larger-scale event and the potential inclusion of a musical group like The Black Keys.  The segment was filled with frequent vulgar language, including the n-word and other offensive terms.

I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting a shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your gear.  Cause you really want to hear Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Opie Anthony show.  Check it.

[00:02:00]  Yo.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now my ties up in this pit.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Hi.  It's Chippa.  No.  It's not Chippa.  It's the radio show.  We started.  No.  You can't be here today.  I'm going home.  It's going to be a long show.  You can't.  Chippa. 
[00:02:30]  Chippa's here the whole day.  I'm gone.  Yeah.  Opie Anthony ain't coming in.  Rebel radio, right?  Yeah.  We just turn it on until we got to go.  No.  What's up?  Opie Anthony or 90 year.  I'm not doing this.  Bob Kelly is here.  I am here.  Chippa is not here.  Yeah.  Jim is here.  Fucking Opie.  Can we say that?  You can swear, Chippa.  Do you know how bad I wanted?  I literally just wanted to chip for fucking... 
[00:03:00]  Do a whole show?  Four hours of chip.  Yeah.  We do know how bad because you do it all day and all night.  But yeah, I got a call this morning.  We knew Opie wasn't coming in because he's taking his occasional Fridays because he wanted  to take a lot of time off this summer.  So he kind of saved up his days.  And Anthony's always, you know, you never know if he's going to want to in the last  minute because, you know, it's a good day off.  You get to relax.  So I get the call from Kenny and he calls me and he's like, do you want to not do the 
[00:03:30]  show?  You don't have to, but Bobby's going to be in or do you just want to come in and mess  around for a short show?  We're not going to do a full show, I don't think.  And Sam, I'm like, all right, well, come in.  You never know.  We could just get going.  Yeah, I do know.  We would do a short one.  Yeah, sometimes you get a pretty good idea.  You know, I'm fucking tired.  And I'm like, why would I say yes to that when I could have just gone back to bed?  Yeah, that was a question a lot of us in the office had.  Why would Jim have said yes to that?  He could have just...  It's because Jim's a creator, man.  He has a creative soul. 
[00:04:00]  Is that it?  He's not going to...  Yeah, I mean, look, man, he's not a...  He has art in his heart.  And Bob's got an eye thing going on, so he's got sunglasses on.  Yeah.  So he's sitting here in the studio, leaning back in his chair with his Ray-Bans on, going  Hey, man, Jim's a creator.  What are you going to do?  We're all artists.  I think that should be his new slogan, art in my heart.  It's like watching Brando be interviewed on the set of The Island of Dr. Moreau.  Yeah.  With dumb sunglasses.  I take it that's one of the movies he was big on.  Well, yeah, it was one of his last films.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  One of his earlier good-looking pieces.  No, this was not the on the waterfront.  This is when he had like a little monkey man on his shoulder.  Yeah.  Okay.  So...  And then I realized I had to announce something today anyway.  But I'm like, why don't I go to bed until 10.30 and then just do the fucking...  This is before I even knew you were coming in.  How are you going to announce?  Just a show I have.  Nothing major.  I can't wait for your big announcement.  Yeah.  It's going to be really special.  I have AIDS.  Well, that wouldn't be an announcement.  That would be a confirmation.  And then Sam and I went and did something last night. 
[00:05:00]  I was like, oh, we can talk about that.  You guys did something?  Oh, yeah, we did.  What the fuck is that?  We went and saw...  I had tickets to see Gene Wilder speak at the 92nd Street Y.  Right.  And he never does interviews.  Like, I watched something with him in 1979.  And they said, wow, this is rare.  You don't do interviews.  Like, he never...  He hates them.  How was he in 79?  He was great.  I mean...  But he was quiet and weird.  Right.  Just like we expected him to be.  And so I asked Sam if he wanted to go. 
[00:05:30]  And he said, yes.  And we met outside the 92nd Street Y.  And it's always a good thing to get a picture.  You always want to kind of...  That's the obsession at these things is you want to meet the guy.  Well, I didn't even know that.  For him.  Yeah, I think.  Like, I was just going to see Gene Wilder.  I didn't think, you know, there was going to be a meet and greet or whatever.  But we got there and...  Anytime Jim invites you to anything...  Yeah.  You...  This is what I know.  That you're going to...  He's going to want a picture.  He's got a meet and greet hooked up.  And he's getting a photo.  No, I didn't have one hooked up. 
[00:06:00]  You just made it happen.  It was luck.  Last time I went there was with me and Sherrod went to see Sidney Poitier speak at the 92nd Street Y.  And that was...  It was a big event.  And so afterwards, we're like, how can we meet him?  And I'm like, I'm ready to just leave.  I'm like fucking defeated.  And Sherrod goes, hey man, that's the back door right there.  Like, that's the stage entrance.  He goes, let's just walk in because they'll think I'm related to him.  They won't stop me.  That's what he said to me.  Sherrod's got balls.  And he's black.  And he's black.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  So we just walked in.  If it was Bill Burr, it wouldn't have worked so well.  No.  I thought he was there to assassinate Sidney Poitier.  So we walked back and it worked.  We just walked backstage.  And I had done something at the 92nd Street Y with Whoopi Goldberg and I think Judy Gold and one other person.  It was a Carlin tribute.  So the security guys knew Sherrod from something and they knew me because I didn't remember them.  They're like, oh yeah, you did that thing.  So they hooked us up and the security guy actually took me back and got me, helped me get my photo and whatever. 
[00:07:00]  So I'm like, yeah, we got a shot.  So Sam and I walked in and that same guy was up front.  Yeah.  Like the first guy we saw knew exactly who Jim was.  I guess you remember him from.  From last time.  Yeah.  Stalking Sidney Poitier.  Yeah.  And he goes, hey, and he took us back and he goes, hey, and he just brought us into this room and he introduced us to the woman.  And he goes, yeah, Jim was here last time.  And he goes, I thought maybe because Gene's coming out to take some press photos, they could meet him.  So it was like the dumbest fucking luck ever. 
[00:07:30]  That's great.  It happened to be that guy in the front.  So we enjoyed it because we got our photo out of the way.  And you talked to him?  Very briefly.  Yeah, just said hello.  He wasn't, you know, he wasn't a big target.  He's a very quiet guy.  He obviously doesn't like, he's not a guy who likes, you know, being famous and meeting people.  And he just likes to keep to himself.  He likes his simple life.  Yeah.  How's his hair?  It's weird.  It's like, I thought he looked, he looked great.  His hair, he looks, people are like, oh, he looks like shit. 
[00:08:00]  But no, his hair is weird.  But when you look at his face, he looked great.  He didn't look bad at all.  Let me see that one.  I mean, his face, yeah, if you get his hair out of the way.  His face looked phenomenal.  His face looks the same.  He looks really healthy.  But his hair, he's just an older guy.  His hair is white now.  And instead of being wild and all over, it's just kind of hanging down on his face.  So people are like, he looks like a dead person.  I'm like, look at his eyes and his face and his smile.  He did not look like a dead person.  He looked great.  How old is he?  80.  80.  Wow.  I mean, it would probably help him out if he would cut his hair a little shorter. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, he doesn't care.  No, he doesn't.  The fuck's he care?  It's Gene Wilder.  Right.  And the woman, me and Sam kind of walked over to where Gene was when he came out to take  his press photos.  And there was only like a couple of press photographers and like five people.  Who interviewed him?  Robert Osborne?  Yeah.  I don't know who that is, but Robert Osborne.  I guess he does a lot of interviews at the 92nd Street Y.  He does some show.  They said what he did.  He does a bunch of celebrity interviews on shows.  You'll know him if you hear his voice. 
[00:09:00]  He has a great speaking.  He sounds like Bill Curtis from those crime shows.  What is he doing now, though?  Who?  Gene.  He writes books.  And that's what he was talking about.  He only talked about this book for a minute.  Yeah, and he said he only did like 18 movies total.  He didn't do a lot of movies, and he stopped making them pretty quick.  Like, he hasn't made a movie in 22 years because he doesn't like movies anymore.  He doesn't like what they are, and they asked him about it, and Osborne asked him about it 
[00:09:30]  and said, why don't you make movies anymore?  And he said just, like, he gave an honest answer.  He's like, I just, he's like the language.  Like, he doesn't like all the cursing, and he's like an old school guy.  He's just not what he likes, and he thinks that the scripts are not good, and he just  is like, and when you look at the movies he did, he did a few shit ones.  And he was honest about them.  Yeah.  He did, the producers, though, was probably one of the funniest movies ever.  And him with Zero Mostel, the opening scene there with those two was one of the funniest 
[00:10:00]  scenes ever filmed.  Well, he told the story of that.  He said that when he went for the audition, he said he was very nervous, and he walked  in, and Mel Brooks, who he had known, introduced him to Zero Mostel, and he said, Zero Mostel  walked over and kissed me on the lips.  And he realized in that moment that he did it to relax him, because he knew he was nervous,  and like, everything's okay now.  And then, of course, he got the part.  But we talked to him.  He's a shy, quiet type guy.  Right.  He doesn't think, he doesn't find himself funny.  He doesn't think he's funny.  No, as a person. 
[00:10:30]  He goes, I'm funny in the movies, but offstage, no.  He's just quiet.  And we took our photos, and we went out and watched them.  It was really nice.  Yeah.  He's a nice man.  That's what he is.  He's a nice, older man who likes to be at home.  He enjoys a cup of tea.  Because he mentioned that multiple times, that he enjoys to drink a cup of tea and give  his wife a kiss.  He doesn't live in the States, though, right?  I don't know.  He lives in England, right?  He lived in England for a while, because he was doing stage stuff over there.  But I think he might be back in New York now.  I think he lives in New York.  What he said he likes to do is he likes to write. 
[00:11:00]  He said he loves writing, because he's quiet.  And then he says, I love to write, and then come out.  Sit with my wife, have a cup of tea, give her a kiss, and then go back in and write.  Yeah.  I'm like, what a nice, what a day, what a day of a nice man that is.  Yeah.  That made me feel good.  Probably wears house slippers all the time.  Just relaxes.  Yeah.  But you know what?  He does have a relaxing...  What do you like to do?  I love to, you know, I don't even like to write anymore.  I've gotten so crazy and lazy with these fucking, my attention span is very short now. 
[00:11:30]  And it's why my writing has suffered.  That's why I can't write stuff.  I just do it on stage, because I'm all over the place.  I like to do the opposite of what Gene likes to do.  It's got to be something busy happening, and some strange woman who I don't know who's  leaving shortly.  Right.  I jerk off for a while, I have a cup of tea, I go back and jerk off some more.  Yeah.  I like to edge, have coffee, attempt to sleep, feel sorry for myself, even though my life  is great, and then go do a show.  But, I mean, those guys grew up with typewriters, for God's sakes. 
[00:12:00]  I mean, they didn't have...  Right.  I mean, they had TV, but they had like a couple channels.  It wasn't a real fucking big deal.  I mean, there's so much crazy shit to take over.  I mean, your fucking phone is just ridiculous.  It distracts you.  But your phone and your iPad, your computer, the TV.  I mean, and living in New York, I mean, there's just fucking a million things.  That's why I'm selling...  You know I'm selling my place.  Yeah.  We had the guys come yesterday to appraise it, and yeah, we're looking at houses. 
[00:12:30]  I want trees.  I want, like, woods.  You're going to move to Westchester?  Yeah, we're moving...  We're going to go to Westchester, upper, on the other side of the river, though.  I'm not moving to...  Where do you live?  Scarsdale.  Yeah.  Oh, Scarsdale?  Yeah.  Is that nice?  It's really nice.  I'm not moving to Yonkers or New Rock.  Why not?  Why not to Scarsdale or where you're close to the city?  Yonkers, New Rock, Mount Vernon.  Those are not nice areas of Westchester, but yeah, Scarsdale.  They have, like, one nice building. 
[00:13:00]  Exactly.  Like, you'll go on the Trulier app, and it'll be, like, to smoke an apartment for $180,000,  but it's in between, like, just burned-down buildings.  Just make sure it's up high.  You're fine.  Yeah, no, I'm all set with that.  I want trees.  I want a backyard.  I want trees.  I don't want too much.  I don't want responsibility, but I don't want to have to fucking get a riding mower.  I don't really necessarily want that because of all the years of living in Jersey, and  it's like, you know, I lived at home until I was 30, doing gigs and stuff. 
[00:13:30]  I hated it, but I was just caught in this rut where I couldn't, and thank God for Jim  Florentine.  Jim Florentine, if it wasn't Jim Florentine, I probably wouldn't be doing stand-up.  I don't know if I would have made it, and I would probably still be home with my parents,  but Jim is just like, come on, move in.  You think you'd still live at home with your parents now?  No, of course not.  But it was literally, by then I was making enough money to move out, and I wanted to  move out.  I was bad at starting that process.  For the first few years, I'd say until I was about 25, it was fine, because I was doing  gigs and making no money. 
[00:14:00]  But then after 20, between 25 and 30, it's like, get out.  I was aching to get out.  I was just like, uh, I didn't know what the process was.  I was such a fucking idiot.  How'd you bang bronze?  Exactly.  It's a great point, Bob.  Good question.  I didn't.  They would suck my dick in the driveway.  I've told this story before, but I would get hookers.  And I'd park in my parents' driveway and put up the fucking, I would put up the, uh,  The scumbag.  The sun thing.  Yeah, the sun visor.  And I would get, in case my mother looked out the window, and I would get blown.  It was at night, but I would get blown behind the sun visor in my driveway. 
[00:14:30]  Because I knew I wouldn't get arrested that way.  And it was two miles from where the hookers were.  I would just drive them there.  I was like, look, we'll park in my driveway.  We won't get in trouble.  And they would come.  They're like, yeah, that sounds smart.  What part of Jersey was that?  North Brunswick.  North Brunswick.  But about five miles from where the stress factor is in North Brunswick.  But anyway, you know, that I finally, so I have no craving for what you're talking about.  That's why you're going fucking nuts for the last ten years.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, because you have your, it must be amazing to you.  It's like I'm at college. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should get bunk beds.  I know.  I should make you hook or sleep on the bottom bunk.  I just, well, they would be on the top, you know.  I'll be the bottom bunk.  You know how it is.  I love the suburbs.  Yeah, I don't mind them, but I just, again, I've spent so much of my life there that I  like this city.  You know, I wish I had, and Opie talks about this a lot.  Like, Opie's weird because, like, you go somewhere with him and, like, he fucking leaves the hotel. 
[00:15:30]  Like, I kind of envy that because he, like, experiences every place we go to.  He can't stay in.  And he's like, he wants outdoor space.  I do the same thing.  When I did that big tour with Dane, they slept until, like, three or four in the afternoon.  And we just were right to the fucking gig.  I would wake up early and just walk around the whole town.  Jim Brewer does that.  There's certain guys that, you know, and I wonder, it's funny because Opie's all growing  up was terrible, like, as far as, like, you know, his mom was crazy. 
[00:16:00]  And so he liked to get the fuck out of the house.  So that's why, I think that's what made him.  And you probably had the same thing.  I got out.  I did the math.  I only lived at home, shit, from, uh, till first, when I was in sixth grade.  And then after that, it was only, I think, maybe, uh, two years.  After sixth grade, it was maybe two, three years.  And then I was in and out, in and out.  And then I was just gone at 16.  I was just on my own.  I wish I could do what you're talking about. 
[00:16:30]  Going out, just exploring the cities.  Because you live, it's like living.  Like, when you go out and do that stuff, you're, like, living.  How come you can't do it?  I don't sleep.  So I'm so tired in the morning.  Oh, I see.  It's only a sleep issue.  It's not out of being, doing anything deviant or whatever.  I would love to go to bed.  Like, I went to bed at, like, 11-something last night.  And I feel okay this morning.  But if I could get, like, six, seven hours a night, I would fucking, I'd go out every morning.  I haven't slept since the baby was born.  And it's fucking maddening.  Well, yeah, but you know what it is.  At least, you and your wife made a choice to have a kid. 
[00:17:00]  You wanted one.  It's not like it was a mistake.  And this is so, for you, it's like, this is what you wanted.  It is what you want.  But you don't really, you don't know.  You think you know, but you really don't know.  And everybody tells you.  A million people tell you, get your sleep, get your sleep.  But you're not really listening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then once it happens, and they go, okay, goodbye.  And you're in a cab or fucking going home. 
[00:17:30]  And you're at your house with this.  All of a sudden, your life is just different.  And there's no, there's no fucking changing.  It's not like when someone comes and visits, like your mom.  You know she's leaving Tuesday.  Your life is going to suck for four days.  But she's gone Tuesday, and you're right back.  It's never going back.  Right now you have a visitor until at least 20, 30, 40.  Yeah.  But your baby is very, I went and saw them in the hospital.  The baby is fucking adorable. 
[00:18:00]  What a cute baby.  How long ago did you have the baby now?  It's a week Sunday.  Her, this past Sunday, right?  Yeah, this past Sunday.  It's been a week.  He, yeah, her water broke Friday after I did spots at the cellar.  I just took a hot one at the Nuke Village Underground.  Oh, you didn't do well?  Man, I just took a hot one.  I went up and I, whoever the fuck was on before me, annihilated.  Very clean, too.  I think it was Ryan Hamilton or something.  Yeah.  Just killed.  Guys like him or Tom Papa you go on after. 
[00:18:30]  Especially Tom Papa.  And he murders clean.  And then, you know, that's fucking all the biddies in the audience.  Like, well, that's what we like.  He's delighted.  Because Tom is, Tom's funny.  And so is Ryan.  I mean, but they're really funny clean guys.  They're not, they're not fucking bullshit hacky clean guys.  No.  When they kill, it's like, oh, they fucking murdered clean.  And you're, it's irritating to watch.  Yeah, it's like John Mulaney.  Yeah.  Fucking annihilates.  Clean.  Clean.  And then when you go up and you're like, you know.  These are guys, like even comedians, like, because comedians a lot of times hate clean 
[00:19:00]  comics who are totally squeaky clean.  Because you're like, oh, you cunt.  But these guys, Mulaney and them, they genuinely are funny, funny guys.  They annihilate.  And I just took a hot one.  I took a nice hot one.  And I tried, you know, I tried to dig myself up with some improv.  I went to some, hey, your face.  Ugh.  You just see the group of women just hating me.  Just turning to eat their stupid chicken fingers.  Why aren't you the last guy?  Yeah, I was so miserable. 
[00:19:30]  I would get home.  And I just was glad the day was over.  Good night.  Good night.  And then my water broke.  She was like, my water broke.  And then.  Was it on time?  Like, were you expecting it?  He came on his due date.  Wow.  And that's like 4%.  So on the day?  He came on his day.  So when you were performing, were you thinking about it?  No, because everybody said, even the doctor, that it's not going to happen on his due date.  It's going to be probably a few days after, maybe a week after.  So we were like walking around and, you know, they said walk and have sex. 
[00:20:00]  You know, you're supposed to have sex too.  Because.  Yeah.  Easy chip.  Yeah.  Because I guess when, you know, it opens up the fucking, it loosens the cervix or some shit.  Nice.  But.  But yeah, the water breaking.  It's not water.  It's disgusting.  It's a consistency of Perel hand lotion.  Okay.  It's like mucus membrane.  No, it's clear, but it's creamy.  Right, Trav?  Did you, did her, did her, her water didn't break? 
[00:20:30]  She was induced.  She was what?  Induced.  You might do.  You don't even hear you, Travis.  Induced.  She was like a week late, I guess.  A week late.  So they just scheduled a.  Yeah.  There's a little, it's called a mucus plug that holds all the water in and that fucking popped.  Is that what the water breaking is?  It's a plug?  It's a plug.  It's a mucus, it's a white thing that holds, it holds all the water in through and once  the cervix loosens up, that pops out and I saw a little piece of it on the floor. 
[00:21:00]  Blah.  It's gross.  I, it was, it was disgusting because it was like, you know, thinking you're drinking milk  and it's orange juice.  I thought it was going to be water.  These, the thing is that people, they just use these words and they never explain, hey  dude, it's, it's kind of creamy.  Right.  Slime.  Yeah, it's slimy.  Your slime broke.  It's like Nickelodeon award.  Right, right.  Don's ass and pussy just won a Nickelodeon award.  I mean, the, the movies kind of change things.  Oh, they fucking suck. 
[00:21:30]  It's not water breaks, baby comes out.  No, it's not.  It's water breaks, you panic, forget everything you learned, you have to fucking clean, I used  every towel on the house to clean it up with my foot because I wasn't touching it.  Were you in bed when it happened?  We're in bed.  Yeah, the whole, yeah, we had to throw that shit out.  The sheets and everything?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, because the dogs, I got dogs.  I was sniffing the mucus, breaking the slime.  Fucking nine weeks later, just throw the mattress out.  No, we didn't throw the mattress out.  We're fine with that. 
[00:22:00]  So wait, did you panic when she said my water broke?  I, yeah, because I was so, I was so, I almost went, no.  I was gonna, I just had put a new episode of the Glades on my iPad.  You know what I mean?  I was fucking, I just wanted this day to be over, man.  I had such a shit day.  You had your night set, not realizing that that was the moment, life.  Like, you're not even gonna get another night now.  Dude, listen, exactly.  I did not realize.  You're never gonna watch that episode of the Glades.  I did.  You did?  You got a chance. 
[00:22:30]  Good.  Yeah, I got a flex arm mount for my iPad mini on my bed, so when I feed that little rascal.  Oh, good.  But, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's just, everything goes out the window, and then you're  looking at this stuff, and it's on her leg, and then you start to feel like, oh, how am  I gonna get a cab, like, because you feel like your, your, your self-esteem just shoots  out of your asshole.  I don't want the guy to get mad and, you know, I'm gonna get shit all over his cab, but 
[00:23:00]  should I bring a towel to wipe up his cab?  I feel bad.  I'm like, oh, fuck this dumb asshole.  That wouldn't pick me up anyways.  Imagine getting in the cab after that, though, and there's afterbirth on the seat.  It's happening.  I guarantee it's happening.  Of course it is.  Because it doesn't stop.  Some women trickle out, but when it gushes out, it doesn't stop.  It's not like it all comes out and you're done.  It just keeps, it just keeps coming out.  And she has to wear, like, you know, a fucking diaper, basically.  They put her in the hospital.  But, uh, yeah, I mean, I had the bag ready. 
[00:23:30]  I had this big, you know the UFC bags we got?  Yeah.  I had that.  That was her bag, her hospital bag.  Just a big green UFC bag.  And I had my bag ready to go with all my shit in it.  My cords reached.  So I know I'm gonna be at the hospital for a couple days, so I'm gonna have all my shit.  You had a tech bag?  I had a tech bag.  Yeah, you got it, dude.  Yeah, your diapers.  I had it all, right?  And then, uh, I'm at, I'm waiting for a cab and I had them both over my neck on either  side.  So they were fucking cutting off the blood to my head because I was panicking. 
[00:24:00]  I didn't realize.  And I was just like, Dawn, I don't feel well.  And I'm like, almost fucking choked myself up.  She's like, take the bag off your neck, dummy.  Took the bag off.  Oh, poor Dawn.  She's got stuff leaking down her leg.  A baby's about to fall out.  Her husband's having a fucking panic attack.  Who was more panicky?  Oh, me.  She was literally going, B, don't panic.  Don't panic, kid.  So, uh, yeah, we got to the hospital and you kind of, it, it, it was close to your house, 
[00:24:30]  right?  It was a few blocks.  It's Roosevelt.  It's right up the street.  Um, we get up there.  Nobody's there, you know, and, uh, you think like, you know, you really think everybody's  going to be a cunt once you get in there because it's a bunch of, you know, it's the middle  of the night and, you know, a bunch of old black ladies just like, oh, you know, like  they've, they've been doing this a million times, but they're actually the nicest people  in the world.  You really did have low self-esteem.  You thought the cabbie was going to be mad at you. 
[00:25:00]  You thought the nurse was going to be upset that you bothered to come in and have a child.  This is the one thing you've done right.  You should be happy about this.  You get so scared that someone's going to treat her fucked up or someone's going to fuck  with us at this moment.  It's fault.  You feel vulnerable.  You are.  Yeah.  You just, I, you just want to, you almost want to just go to a private hospital, private  car, but I, it's New York.  So I got to do all this shit and you get very vulnerable and then you get up there and  the doctor comes in.  I got to page the doctor and I'm like, sorry for waking you.  That's what she does. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, she's on call, you know, but I'm like, I, it's not like she's at home and you,  you woke her up and you got to look at the stuff.  She's like, is there any color in it?  Does it have a smell?  Well, you really got to man up at that point and be like, no.  And, and then we get up there and they, they, they really go inside your wife's vagina.  Like it's fucking for the baby comes out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they, they go inside in such an evasive way and invasive way.  They, I mean, they don't, there's no, you know, hang on looking at easy. 
[00:26:00]  They just go fucking open it up and they, you're, you're not even a centimeter.  And then they pull it out and just blood on their hand and you're like, and your wife's  like, ow, ow, ow, you know, like she's banging fucking charade.  So, and then they sent us home because she had no, she had no contractions.  She had no, she had contractions, but they were very small.  She had no pain.  So they were like, you know what?  Go home till two 30 unless anything happens. 
[00:26:30]  How was this?  This was, uh, that was two 30 at night.  So we left around, we probably left around five in the morning, in the morning.  We just got in our cab, went home, went to bed, woke up at 12, showered, got everything  together again and went back in at two 30 in the afternoon.  She still wasn't having pain.  And then they had to put this thing up there called the server Dell, which is like a piece  of, it's like a ribbon that they wrap around a thing and they put it up near her cervix.  And they induce, they induced her, right? 
[00:27:00]  That's the, what did you have?  We had a daughter.  No, no.  What did you, she did the same thing, right?  Yeah.  I mean, but, but hers was scheduled.  Like, like we knew, right.  They were just going to do it.  We're like, okay, Saturday one o'clock, let's go have a baby.  Right.  That's basically what they did too.  I mean, they, they said two 30 and then if you're not doing this, we're going to do  this.  And if that doesn't happen, then if, if, you know, they, they try to make the contractions  happen.  And then that stuff, once it worked, but, but labor pains with, it was so fucking sad 
[00:27:30]  to watch.  It was, it was like watching somebody murder your wife.  Yeah.  You're completely helpless.  Like you can't do anything to make her feel better.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You're rubbing her back.  She's squeezing your hand.  And I lost my self-esteem in the middle of the labor and the nurse actually picked it  up off the ground.  I was like, I was just, she's like a baby.  She, she looked at me crying.  Like I've never seen Don in such pain and went, I don't know if I can do this baby. 
[00:28:00]  And I was like, I just, I didn't know what to say.  And the nurse went, Don, look at me, look at me, look at, breathe.  I want you to breathe.  Give me a breath.  And I was just like, breathe, breathe, just breathe, breathe on.  And then I slowly got my self-esteem back and like, all right, I get how this fucking  works.  When you get a good nurse, like we had a good nurse too.  They're fucking good.  Yeah.  Like they are incredible at what they do.  Yeah.  They tried to switch up a nurse in the middle. 
[00:28:30]  The girl that was helping us, they were like, all right, you have to go down here.  Cause she was a traveling.  And Don was like, I couldn't know some like fucking just asshole older lady comes in kind  of like, didn't want to do it.  Like, yeah, you gotta go, you gotta go.  They want you downstairs.  I'll take over Don.  Thank God she has self-esteem.  She was like, can I please not do this?  Like in labor, she's like, I want her to stay.  I don't want you.  She just said that to her face.  Yeah.  And the lady was like, okay. 
[00:29:00]  And then, you know, but here's how fucked up it is.  They put her in labor.  Then they give her the, the fucking epidural, which if you don't get an epidural and you  give natural birth, you're a fucking, you're, there's something wrong with you.  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of women do that, right?  Yeah.  It's because it's 2013 and we've made the shit better.  No, I mean, a lot of them just give a natural birth.  Like they tried to.  Yeah.  I think like some women like take pride in like, I wasn't drugged. 
[00:29:30]  I had it all in that.  Yeah.  I think a lot of women try to and intend to.  Yeah.  But then once they get there, they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It's a, yeah.  I want to do it the way they did it in Game of Thrones.  It's like, yeah.  It's like, why though?  There's no, it's so silly.  It's stupid.  Yeah.  Like I have a giant needle that can make you feel really good.  Why don't you just take it?  Yeah.  It's still coming out.  Yeah.  They, they just want to do it the way they did it for thousands of years.  They want to do it just so they could say I had it natural.  Yeah.  They want to be better than, and yeah, well go do it in the fucking park then, asshole. 
[00:30:00]  Do it the real way.  Exactly.  Go give it, go give dirt babies.  Yeah.  Stand up like they do in Africa.  Yeah.  Drop it into someone's hands.  Tough guy.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, uh, this guy comes in and she's in so much fucking pain.  It's like, holy shit.  You don't know what to do.  Then this guy comes in.  Finally, she's shaking and they're putting a needle in your chick's spinal cord.  And I went to look and the doctor actually went, no, no, no, no, I've, uh, you can't do 
[00:30:30]  that.  You, I've seen many husbands pass out by looking at what, what that does it really hurt the  needle or the, no, because they, they, it's, it's huge, dude.  It's fucking huge.  And, but they, they, you know, they know they, they numb the whole area first.  So she feels it, but it's pressure.  It's not like something's in my, someone just stabbed me in the spine.  But as soon as that happens, it's okay.  Everything becomes okay again.  Did it take?  Yeah.  What doesn't take sometimes?  No.  Uh, Lisa, it only took half her body.  Like she could still feel. 
[00:31:00]  Oh God.  And they can't do it again, right?  No.  Why?  It's too much.  I think it's too much.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  So half her body was fucking hurting.  Yeah.  She didn't, she didn't get the whole thing.  Oh my God, dude.  I know it.  They, they keep checking on that.  They're like, how, where do you feel this?  You should feel it on the left.  You should feel this on the right.  And they, but it's, it's like, yeah, it's like, it's weird because it's not, it doesn't  come in and go, it takes a long time for them to get it exactly right.  So that's crazy that she felt half of it.  Holy shit.  You mean like, like, like her left side of her body, like her left leg and left arm were fine. 
[00:31:30]  Like she could tell that it wasn't working like it should be working.  Oh yeah.  That's scary too.  Yeah.  Cause it's kind of like, oh, here's a carrot.  Oh yeah.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  She had like a Tylenol or something, right?  Trev?  Yeah.  Chip.  That's how it works.  No.  I know a girl, my, uh, my wife's friend, they actually gave her too much and she couldn't  feel her legs for like a week.  She had to stay in the hospital.  She was basically paralyzed for a week.  Did they hit the wrong spot or was it just too much?  They probably hit the wrong spot. 
[00:32:00]  They, they, they fucked up.  It's probably another reason why some people like natural childbirths to try.  I mean, it's still, well, shoving a needle into your spine is still a risky thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's fucking crazy risky.  And I had, I had the, uh, the shadower, you know, when you're at fucking Applebee's  and the real waiter comes over and he has some other fucking nervous Nelly with only  one fucking flare on his suspensions.  I had that guy come in and then he does it.  Nate, Nate, your wife's literally fucking losing her mind for hours, like maybe a couple 
[00:32:30]  hours.  She's in the worst pain she's ever felt.  She, you know, her tits hanging out, her box is hanging out.  It looked, and her box looks like Rocky's mouth in Rocky three, you know, cause doctors  have just been sticking arms up it for fucking hours.  And this doctor comes in, dude, kind of good looking dude, whatever.  He's got some fucking, you know, Lance Armstrong bracelets on.  So, you know, he does some type of workout regimen.  And then he's leaving.  He looks at me, he goes, Hey, comedy seller.  I was like, Oh Jesus.  Fuck me. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I'll give you free tickets.  If you don't tell people that you saw my wife's box on Facebook and don't fucking snap  iPhone shots of it.  Yeah.  And then, uh, and then after that happens, she goes to bed and then the doctors just keep  and then you're in this chair and it cranks back and you go to sleep and you're fucking  on your iPad and you, and then she, uh, you keep coming in and checking her cervix.  They keep coming in.  You don't want to look at that shit too.  They have pretty much a, what is it?  Like a diaper under her.  The bed is like a big diaper and they just keep ripping it off and throwing a new one on. 
[00:33:30]  Why?  Cause it's leaking.  Well, there they go inside of her and there's shit.  I mean, there's, there's stuff coming out of her.  Yeah.  And once you have the upper duro, like you can't move, like you've like, she's got to  go to the bathroom right there.  You know?  Like you can't get out of that bed.  Yeah.  She got a shit in the bed.  Yeah.  Does it stink?  If she has to.  Do you smell it or do you not even realize it's happening?  Well, no, she didn't.  My wife didn't shit.  Thank fucking God.  That would have bothered me.  Dude, if I saw my wife shit, I, I don't know if they'd be, I don't know if we'd come 
[00:34:00]  home from that.  I get fucked up when there's a little fucking stain on the toilet that she doesn't fucking,  you know what I mean?  Like, I know it's not my shit nugget that it's like, she took like a, just a dark dehydrated  shit.  And there's a little tiny spot in the toilet.  I'm like, clean that the fuck up.  You know, would you, would you be grossed out if you came in and it was all spray on the  back and you lift the toilet seat?  It was one of those.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  If my, if Don, I, I, I didn't look at any of that.  I just occasionally looked, but then they keep coming back in and then it was at three  in the morning.  She comes in.  She goes, uh, she checks you 10 centimeters.  This is happening.  Lights go on.  You know, it's like about 12 hours after you got there.  Yeah.  The second time.  The second time.  And then she goes, all right, let's do a test push.  And she goes, all right, you grab this leg.  And I had to grab her other leg and she has to kind of, I have to hold the back of her  head and she kind of curls her body around the baby. 
[00:35:00]  And Don, I don't know if she's just a tough broad from Boston, but she goes, all right,  just push, you know, on the, for 10.  She goes, one, two.  Oh, the doctor's like, I, I feel the head.  I feel it's coming.  And she just panicked.  She's like, cause you didn't think it was happening that quick.  And fucking 20 minutes later, the baby's on her chest.  I have, you want to see?  I saw the video.  Yeah.  It's, it's, here's the thing though.  You think you're going to be, I did tear up.  She teared up.  You tear up, but you're in shock. 
[00:35:30]  It's not, you want it to be like the movies.  Like we did, we made the baby.  Yeah.  We did the baby.  Like you're connected to it a hundred percent, but you're not.  Cause a human being just came out of your wife's vagina and it kind of looks like you  too.  And you're like, what the, you're in shock.  Yeah.  Dawn was in shock.  You can see in that video, she's like, Oh my God.  She's trying to figure out what the fuck just happened.  And this thing is going, and it's like, wow. 
[00:36:00]  So what, so you, your first thought when the baby pops up is like, Oh my, it's, you know,  you don't have a thought.  You're trying to have a, you're trying to connect.  You're trying to have that moment.  You're trying to, at least I was, I was trying to make a, I feel like a serial killer who fell  in love.  You know what I mean?  But couldn't, couldn't connect.  You knew what the feelings were, but you couldn't find them or feel them.  Yeah.  You knew what the, I knew the feelings I was supposed to have, but it was so, Oh my God,  overwhelming that I couldn't get on.  And then all of a sudden you do connect. 
[00:36:30]  It's like, Oh my God, there it is.  And you feel it.  And then you start to cry and then it's just cuts off because somebody does something or  says something.  And, and I cut the cord too, which wasn't even that bad.  People made it.  It's like calamari.  It's fucking, if you're not looking, if you're not looking, if you don't look at an umbilical  cord that's connected to the baby and then coming out of your wife's vagina, if you don't  see the two ends and you just see that part, it's bad.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  So wait, now you pick the baby up and they wipe it off. 
[00:37:00]  How long?  When do they wipe it off?  I didn't pick it up.  No, no, no.  But when they don't, they don't wipe it off.  They leave a lot of that.  The white stuff is like cream.  It's actually good for the baby.  It's like the most, it's the best like skin cream ever, apparently.  But, uh, they leave the baby, they leave it on the baby and you just, did you kiss the  baby with it on there?  No, not me.  I'd throw up on the baby's fucking head.  Fucking get a blood nugget on my fucking head.  I'd accidentally fucking snort in. 
[00:37:30]  He'd go in like spaghetti in my nose and come out the back of my throat.  Don't they wipe his face off a little something?  No, they do wipe it off and they clean his mouth and they, you know, they, and it's so,  they're so fucking, it looks like they're being rough with the kid, but they know exactly  how rough to be, you can be with a newborn to not break it.  Yeah.  But like, you know, they just fucking grab it, suck all the stuff out of its mouth.  It's crying.  What do they, what do they use, a suction thing to pull the gunk out?  And he's cold.  You feel bad because he's just shaking.  Yeah.  Because he was in a warm, you know, womb for nine months and now he's just out in an AC 
[00:38:00]  fucking shitty New York hospital fucking just shaking on some nervous chick's tit.  It really is a tremendous reality switch.  It's the first time you see everyone.  It's, it's fucking nuts.  Do they spank him or no?  Like they smack him to make him breathe?  No, they don't do that.  No, he's breathing.  He comes out.  I actually, I looked down at one point, I, I, she didn't want me looking too, but at  one point when she said the head's out, I looked and I saw it was, you know, my kids 
[00:38:30]  got a lot of hair too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw his head and it was kind of smushed.  Like, you know, I didn't know this, a woman's tailbone and I think some other, the front,  I don't know, Trevor, maybe you can help me out.  But they, they, they unhook, they unhinge like a woman's, they unhook.  Like a snake mouth?  Something like that.  Like something happens to a woman's body where the bones kind of unhinge and the baby's head, 
[00:39:00]  that's why it's, as the soft spot, it kind of smushes to come out and the doctor turns  it in a certain way.  So, you know, it's fucking crazy how this shit just works and the baby comes out and  I saw the little smushed head coming out of a vagina, but the perspective was from  the top.  So it wasn't direct on looking at a pussy and an asshole with a head coming out of it.  Yeah.  It was just, it just saw a head coming out of, oh, it was crazy.  I'm shocked that someone like you who gets so grossed out so easily would even think about 
[00:39:30]  looking.  I, that when she's, I couldn't help it.  She said, the head is out.  And I just went, oh my God, I have to see this.  And I looked.  It was just instinct and I looked and there was no blood.  There was no nothing at that angle.  That's what I mean.  Like if I was looking straight on and I saw the, you know, the puddle of guck under it  and just, you know, fucking dragon snort coming out of my wife's pussy, I would have thrown  up.  But, you know, it was just that angle. 
[00:40:00]  And then, and then they put it on your wife and she's crying and it's, you could see it  hit her.  You can see the, it fucking, you know, her breakdown, like it's her start to connect  to this kid.  And then all of a sudden she's holding this kid and it's quiet and it's just looking up  at him and you're like, holy fuck.  And you're just a bystander at that.  You're just like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  And then they, uh, and then they clean them off a little bit and then they do all this  shit.  They just do shit to him right away. 
[00:40:30]  Do they suck?  They use a suction thing to pull stuff out of his nose and mouth?  A nose and mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been in water for nine months.  How long after he was like out until you held him?  Um, minutes.  Oh, right after.  Yeah.  Minutes.  I cut the cord.  Um, and then she, they do a little surgery on the cord, which is fucking disgusting when  it comes back.  It just looks like a hole in your baby's belly.  Um, and then, uh, he's got that big belly button, you know, it's on it.  It's just an outie. 
[00:41:00]  It looks like, you know, like a prisoner's belly button.  Yeah.  And then, uh, and then you held them.  They wrap them, they swaddle them.  And that's when you, all of a sudden that's from that moment that you, you start learning  what's swaddling mean?  Swaddling means, I want to, I want to do it to you.  That's the way you should be tucked in every night.  Just swaddled.  Does that mean when they wrap them tight?  It's a certain way of wrapping the baby that he feels like he's in the womb again.  It helps them chill the fuck out because he's tight. 
[00:41:30]  His arms are tight.  It protects him from his own arms.  And it also, when they sleep, a lot of babies die.  Not a lot.  SIDS, you know.  Yeah.  They die because the, they roll over their face gets in a blanket and they just fucking  die.  So you have to keep them kind of tight against themselves.  So they don't roll over and fucking mush their face and mouth into a blanket.  And they don't know how to turn over at that age, right?  Um, no, but they fuck her.  They just kick and move.  And like, if you watch my kitty, you know, when he's waking up, he's just kicking and moving.  Little nails. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  He's got a little, he's got fucking Edgar nails.  My fuck.  I made her file him down immediately.  Um, but, and then they take you, uh, and they take you over to your room and she's you,  her and the baby.  And you sit in this room with this fucking baby in the, in the, in the, did you get a  private room?  Uh, you know, we were going to, and I told her, I go, look, we'll get the private room.  It's a thousand dollars a night.  Cash.  Yeah.  I mean, cash.  It's not covered. 
[00:42:30]  It's not covered.  And you can't like bill me later.  Like, no, I want the money straight up.  You have to, you have to, as soon as you have the baby, the doctor goes, okay.  You know, a little bit after he goes, okay, we can send you down now to get a private  room.  If you want to go, you have to sign up for it.  And if it's available, yeah, they've only got a couple, they only got a couple.  And if it's available and you have, you have the money, you do it.  And I told Dawn, I go, why don't we just do that?  She goes, I don't want it.  I don't want the private room.  Uh, it's, it's fucking a waste of money. 
[00:43:00]  It's, I think it's bullshit how much money it is.  Certain hospitals are like five bills, which is kind of reasonable.  Yeah.  500, but a thousand dollars a night.  It's like, what?  Is there a fucking, am I getting a hand job?  You know?  Yeah.  It's like fucking Jesus.  Why, why, why interject that?  But she, she goes, plus when you get, you, I get to stay over all night in a private room.  And she was like, I, I think I need you to go home, get sleep, walk the dogs.  And I want to, they take the baby at night in the nursery. 
[00:43:30]  When you're in a, a regular room, they'll take the baby.  They, they would do it in the private room too.  They take the baby and they give her a rest too.  So, and I, if you have a baby and you can get afford a private room, I would never not  get it again.  I mean, I would never do a shared room again.  It was a fucking pain in the ass.  The lady on this side had the control of the heat and it was hot as fuck because she  was some from fucking some hot country.  And I'm dying.  I told you to get a private room. 
[00:44:00]  I know.  And I, she didn't want it.  It was the best money I ever spent.  She didn't fucking want it.  And I told her too.  I actually, I had the money, I saved, like, this is the money for the private room.  She's like, I don't want it.  Once we found out that we could get the private room for X amount, I don't think it was a  thousand dollars because we, we went, we were out in Brooklyn.  But yeah, best money I ever spent.  How many nights do you have to stay?  One night, two nights?  Two nights.  We were going to stay one because Dawn was actually doing great.  But then she had a, I went home and I got a call the next day and she was, she had a  breakdown. 
[00:44:30]  That's when you guys called me.  It was Monday.  You know, she had the baby Sunday.  We spent Sunday night, Monday.  You guys called me and I was on hold and I just hung up because I got a phone call from  her and she was fucking losing her mind.  And she had a, like a crazy night where I, it was stupid.  I wasn't there.  Uh, and she had to go out into the nurses.  She walked out into the lobby and just started, had a breakdown, like crying.  Like, I don't know what to do.  Like, I don't, the baby's crying and I'm trying to feed and she just, cause she didn't know 
[00:45:00]  what the fuck to do.  Yeah.  It's like a day in and she's by herself and I felt terrible and I, I just ran up there,  but all, this is what's great.  And all these nurses surrounded her and hugged her and they were fucking on her.  Yeah.  They taught her everything and kind of gave her shit back.  Like her self-esteem, like you're going to do this.  And they taught her breastfeeding and swat and they just, this, this three things, the  kid, the kid cries, you know, I see people like, Oh, come on. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, it's okay.  No asshole.  He doesn't know English shit, Dick.  He's not trying to get attention, you know, so you give him, you know, fucking, you know,  say nice things to him.  He's, he, he shit his pants.  He pissed.  He's hungry or he needs to be burped.  That's pretty much it.  Do you burp him?  Yeah.  You get a burp.  Does it work?  You feed the abs of fucking Lily.  You feed him, you burp him and you change him.  That's, that's all you do to a kid.  And as soon as you do, then you get fucked up because you'll feed him and he's crying 
[00:46:00]  and then you'll try to burp him and it doesn't work.  And then you look and he's got, he pissed his pants.  So it's like, fuck, but it's like 20 minutes went by and you're trying to burp him.  It's like, this isn't working.  And then you look, you just got to remember those three things.  And then you go, well, I always say at the door, like, well, did he piss?  Oh yeah.  Do they cry?  Like, it's weird.  Babies cry when they piss or shit.  Like, yeah.  What a weird instinct that is.  Like they don't know, even at that age, they don't want to sit in their own waist. 
[00:46:30]  There's something about that.  Like, why would a kid cry when they, it hurts their skin?  Oh, that's what it is.  It burns.  And plus my kid had a circumcision because he's a fucking human and, uh, you know, his  dick is fucking exposed.  So when he pisses, I mean, you gotta, this is the fucked up thing is you go, you go right  from this world that you live in to, to rubbing Vaseline on a baby, a little tiny asshole and, 
[00:47:00]  and, and kid nuts, which are fucking adorable, by the way, the best nuts ever.  This little fucking look like little, little tiny fucking.  Will you think of something?  Peaches.  Okay.  Fucking enraging.  Watch you try to think of two cute small things.  They look like, dude, it's like, how many things are you rifling through?  Cadillac tires?  No.  They look like small rings of Saturn?  No. 
[00:47:30]  I really, I didn't want to be.  Oh, it was fucking enraging.  You actually said what my fucking head was saying to myself.  But yeah, it's, it's fucking nuts.  You have to, you know, you have to put Vaseline on the fucking balls and then on the dick and  push the dick down.  And I've been pissed on already, which is not because you don't even see it coming.  You're like, you peed.  And then, yeah, you'd, it's pretty much like dating you. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Having a baby.  There's just shit.  And you're getting pissed on and you're crying and then you're feeding them and then  you're happy.  And you're not sleeping properly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's nuts.  But, you know, it's, you kind of see Dawn fall in love with the kid.  Like it's, it's, it's kind of weird.  Like they're like, what the fuck?  They have this relationship with the baby in its, well, it was in them inside of the belly.  And women might, I think they love that. 
[00:48:30]  They love that nine months of in the belly.  And when it comes out, it's, they almost, they're almost sad.  Like, fuck.  Like that's gone.  Like that, you know, rubbing your belly and hey, and he's here.  And, you know, people touching you and giving you all these accolades and treating you differently.  And, you know, and that's gone.  Now, all of a sudden it's in your hand and it takes them a couple days.  But you see them all, all of a sudden just fall in love with the kid.  And they're just, Dawnja, I, I gotta stop staring at the fuck. 
[00:49:00]  Go to bed.  You know, we do shifts.  Like, you know, I'm going to do the first shifts because I had to wake up this morning.  So, I'm going to take care of it.  So, go to bed.  Get some sleep.  And I just see her staring at the kids.  Like, stop.  I get it.  But you can, you, you can, watching a baby, you just go into a fucking trance.  Really?  Yeah, because they're, you're like, what the fuck are you thinking?  It's like, they're just moving in their eyes.  You see them, they, all of a sudden they smile.  And you're like, is that a smile?  Do you know what I mean? 
[00:49:30]  Like, did he just think of something funny that he doesn't know?  It's weird.  You know what I mean?  Like, the faces and the hands and, yeah, it's, it's kind of mesmerizing after a while.  And, uh, but then I'm just saying you just fall into it.  It's, it's almost like being in the military because now all of a sudden, like, me and Travis  have this fucking thing in common that we can talk about.  And, and like, dude, what about, yeah.  And what about, oh yeah.  Like I, you know, we were texting the other day about breastfeeding and it's like, not  even like a stupid thing. 
[00:50:00]  And he was telling me, just go to formula.  And I was like, oh, thank God.  You know, breastfeeding is a nightmare too.  That's a, I mean, my wife's tits are food now for my kid.  My wife's tits, like, you know, is like saving me money.  It's like Groupons.  It's, that's funny.  It's just fucking weird, dude.  It's, you know, and now it's, it's, it's a wrap. 
[00:50:30]  Like I, you know, fucking went to bed at 10 last night.  Oh, you did?  Well, not to bed, but you go downstairs.  Cause you, the kid, you got to teach the kid that it's nighttime.  Go the fuck.  Cause if you don't do that shit, he'll be up with me and Dawn at three in the morning,  just fucking up.  And then he's, you know, he'll sleep all day.  And, you know, when you want to go to bed, he'll just be fucking up.  So there's all this shit you have to learn.  It's a constant curve, learning curve of how to, and you can't neglect it. 
[00:51:00]  You cannot not get up when the baby cries.  There's no, I'll let Kelby shit in the house sometimes.  I'll just fucking wait till it hardens.  I'll pick it up.  Fucking fuck it.  You know, like we, we've been out late, you know, like we had to go home and you know,  it's like, yeah, fuck it.  They're probably going to, Dave is going to piss in the house.  He's going to go home and you pick it up.  It's a fucking, you can't do that with a kid.  Right.  You have to be there. 
[00:51:30]  You have to take care of it.  You know, and it's, it's, it's fucking crazy, man.  It's crazy.  You want to take a break and eat something real quick at 7 a.m.?  Yeah.  Let's get some fucking titty milk.  Yeah.  You want to knock out some live reads this break?  Oh, I'll do one and then fucking, and I want to eat.  Okay.  It is a very cute, very cute bear.  It's really fucking interesting, man.  Yeah.  You look, you're good with a baby too.  Yeah.  The kids and animals tend to like me.  I'm like, Hey, what's up?  The kids are like, Oh, your chip.  He sent this.  First of all though, his chip that he sent was right when Dawn went into labor. 
[00:52:00]  And it, it was the only time she laughed.  Like that, like she just started fucking out.  Can I play it real quick?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  It was, it made it.  Thank God you sent.  I have fucking, it made me like chip actually, but it made her.  Yeah.  I just cheer everybody up.  That's what I do.  It was hilarious.  I do what I do.  You should just go to hospitals and help all these pregnant women.  I just make videos.  I'm like, Hey, look, it's this chip. 
[00:52:30]  The baby's coming soon.  You know, what are you going to do?  Right?  I wish you were in a hospital.  Fuck you.  Here it is.  Ready?  He's hunk of garbage.  This is the one, right?  I think this is it.  What's up?  Got a brand new deck of cards.  Oh, that's not it.  Someone's trying to steal my magic tricks.  Piece of shit.  I hate that fucking one.  Here it is right here.  Hi Dawn, it's Chippa. 
[00:53:00]  I just wanted to tell you congratulations that you're having your baby.  And I just wanted to say, you gotta fucking relax.  Just fucking relax.  Don't fucking panic.  Just push.  Push.  Just having a fucking baby.  That makes sense.  See?  People, someone thought I was a doctor.  You'd be a great midwife.  I showed the nurse that video.  If I could just fucking videotape her confused face.  What is this guy doing?  She was like, is he okay?  I was like, yeah, that's Chippa. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, that's a tart friend.  We're hanging with Bob here.  We don't know how long we're going to go.  We're not going to do a full show.  Opie had planned to take the day off.

And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all.  He was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him.  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald, Donald, before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?

Stop saying whatevs.  Why not?  You know, I have to thank, though.  Seriously.  You're welcome.  Dr. Steve saved my fucking life.  Whoa.  He is the smartest guy.  I mean, he sounds the best when he guesses.  He's he fucking say I call him at least 30 times a day. 
[00:57:30]  30 times a day.  I just I call him.  I don't even talk to her doctor or the pediatrician.  I call him first.  He's so fucking smart with this shit and saved my life.  Like the kid wasn't pooing for a couple of days and you start to panic because you're like, you know, he's eating and there's something in there, but it's not coming out.  And I thought like his asshole was broken and he's like, no, you are no brush milk.  The kids don't two days is natural. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  A lot of times they'll just digest it.  They don't.  What's going to happen is it will come out in a burst of hibiscus fluid.  But, you know, there's nothing to be concerned about.  If it goes on for more than six months, you might want to have it looked at.  Yeah.  The kid's belly button fell off yesterday and I fucking panicked because it still had a little tag.  He goes, just just pull it off.  And I go to pull it and the kid goes, ah.  I'm like, the fuck, Steve?  Well, I mean, it can't be enjoyable.  You're pulling his belly button off. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, but he made it sound like it's just going to come off.  And I said, like I started pulling his penis got smaller.  Yeah, that never happened to me.  Oh, fucking chipper.  I have.  Where are you going to be?  Are you having any gigs coming up?  Yeah, I do.  I go to fucking Foxwoods, June 27th, 28th, 29th.  I'm doing a you know what, dude, podcast show.  Me and Kelly Festuca and Luis J. Gomez are doing the show that weekend.  It's a comedy show, though, right?  Not a live podcast. 
[00:59:00]  No, we might be doing a live podcast, too, after one of the shows.  Oh, but it is.  It's comedy and then also.  It's mainly the show.  Gotcha.  And then I'm doing Just for Laughs.  I'm doing the nasty show with fucking Big J.  I don't know, a bunch of other people, but I'm doing that.  I'm doing the whole week up there.  I'm doing like a shitload of shows.  We're going to be up there.  Are you going to be up there with us?  I'm up there for two weeks.  When are we up there?  We'll be there.  Okay.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  We're broadcasting. 
[00:59:30]  We haven't announced it yet.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, whatever.  Oh.  Well.  And then Bob will do that.  I got a...  Yeah, I'm definitely going to be up there.  I'm up there for two weeks.  I'm up there the whole time.  I love Just for Laughs.  It's like camp.  It's like comedy camp.  It is.  I like it if the accommodations are...  I refuse to stay in that main hotel.  I'll literally...  I'll sleep outside before I'll sleep in that hotel.  In the high end?  Never.  Why?  Just won't do it.  And don't like it.  Won't stay there.  Dude, everybody stays there.  Good for them. 
[01:00:00]  Enjoy.  I'll sit down the street.  You guys enjoy.  It's not a bad hotel.  It stinks.  I fucking hate it.  Why?  Why, though?  I will not stay there.  They have room service?  Not 24 hours.  They don't.  And they didn't last time I was up there because it was a fucking strike.  So they had no room service.  And no one even told them.  I went ballistic in the hotel when I got there.  It was an hour ago that he was saying, if it wasn't for Jim Florentine, he'd probably still  live with his parents.  Yeah.  And now he's...  I refuse to stay in that hotel.  24-hour room service.  I'm under no illusions. 
[01:00:30]  I'm a cunt.  But the problem is, it's not even out of being spoiled.  It's because I'll eat bad if I eat...  Yeah.  But if you get a 24-hour room service, you can order a salad with a little grilled chicken  and at least have a manageable fucking meal.  If you have a lot of money in the bank.  If you're on a budget, you can't.  Well, you know, again, but you have a baby and a wife.  I'm kidding.  You have different stuff.  Like, I'm lucky I don't have those expenses so I can indulge others.  I was kidding.  No, I know, but I'm saying, like, legitimately...  You can afford a chicken salad?  I can get a chicken salad.  I can do it.  But last time we were there, we had a blast.  Last time I checked in, I was doing Bob Saget's show. 
[01:01:00]  He was doing some...  And I was doing a gala or whatever I was doing.  And I love Bob Saget.  And so I get up there and I realize I'm in this hotel with no room service and they want  me to go on last and close the show.  And I'm like, it was a live thing on Comedy Central, the Canadian comedy show.  I'm like, no.  I don't want to close the fucking show.  I don't have close the show's self-esteem.  That's why I admire Patrice.  I wish I had his self-worth.  Yeah, but he didn't...  Well, you know what I'm saying. 
[01:01:30]  For that, he would...  He'd go up and bomb and laugh.  Ah, I'm bombing fucking you dumb Canadians.  You know?  You want to actually do good.  Yeah.  I have the same thing.  I've never done a gala.  If people don't know, they're called galas.  They have regular shows that you do that are really fun.  There's no pressure, really.  It's just a regular crowd.  But the gala is like filming a TV show, like a Comedy Central special for Canadian TV.  And the lights are up for filming. 
[01:02:00]  It's a bunch of...  It's a lot of rich people.  I've never done well on a gala.  Never.  I've only done one gala.  They've invited me one time and I did okay.  I don't think they give a shit, though.  I think they like you and they don't...  Hey, just...  They get it.  They get that it's not the...  You know who killed Bob Marley?  Annihilated on the gallery.  I went out and did...  And I swear to God, I thought I was going to kill it.  And I just did mediocre.  Same thing.  Two minutes in, you're like, they're fucking done.  I'm just...  Nobody's really laughing where they're supposed to. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I did well.  And then none of us did great.  We all did okay.  And I was next to last.  And John Panette closed the show.  And I've talked about it before.  Or that fucker went up and just hammered.  John Panette's really funny.  And they love him up there.  He's done probably 20 galas.  But he was legitimately funny.  It wasn't just, we like this guy.  He did a bit about gluten.  He closed on a bit about gluten.  This is funny.  I'm like, who the fuck does that?  But he was talking about just being depressed because everything has gluten in it. 
[01:03:00]  He's like, you know what doesn't have gluten?  Bullets.  He really made...  He fucking really made me laugh.  He's a funny, funny fuck.  He is funny, man.  He's very funny.  They always put the big guy at the end.  The person they know who's going to annihilate on a gala is always at the end.  It has to be.  Yeah.  I did one up there.  I think Kevin Hart.  They were telling me not to swear and don't say this.  And it's like, oh, fuck me.  Did Kevin close it?  Kevin went up and he swore.  He talked about baby shit.  And he fucked. 
[01:03:30]  And he said, fuck.  And I went to the lady.  I go, why can he say that?  He goes, he just says it.  It's kind of cute the way he says it.  I'm like, oh, fuck yourself.  Yeah, do what you want.  Who cares what they say?  Yeah.  He killed.  Of course he killed.  The gals are fun.  I mean, whatever.  As long as you know you're not going to fucking kill.  Yeah.  I'm doing my own hour show up there, too.  I got two of those.  Oh, cool.  The first time they gave me one.  They're whatever.  It's not like I'm doing my own fucking special up there.  But they have, they give you like a small venue and you get to do an hour, which is great.  And I'm doing the podcast up there. 
[01:04:00]  You're going to be on it, right?  Colin's on it.  It depends on what, if I'm there, I'll do it.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's just, it's in the hotel.  In the, we just, they give me a table and we go, we do the show.  He doesn't go in that hotel.  I don't, I think we're broadcasting from the, whatever it is, Bobby.  You can't go in the hotel.  I just broadcast.  He refuses.  Yeah.  I just broadcast.  But it'll be fun up there.  We're going up there for, I don't know how long we're going to be there for, but.  Two days.  Two days.  And I, I do enjoy Montreal, like without pressure, like the gala was pressure and not fun. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, it's pressure.  But I don't want to be a douche.  I'm weird with that festival because for years they gave me nothing.  And then, now they're really nice to me, so I can't hold that again.  Yeah, me neither, dude.  They gave me shit for years.  And then, but once you're in, once Bruce and, and Robbie and, and, and Suzanne, once they  like, once they know you, you just in every couple of years you go in.  And I, I've had the best to last time I was up there with you.  I was up there with Louie the time before, Louie and DiPaolo.  You've done the nasty show, right?  A few times, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  It's one of my favorite things to do.  You're up there for a week.  I don't, you know, it's funny.  I, like, Geraldo hosted last time I did it.  Uh, it was, I forget who else was, I had to close it.  I don't remember if there was a black girl on the floor.  I know, I feel terrible saying that because she's a friend of mine.  I just can't, I'm blanking right now.  But, uh, I forget who was on before that.  I don't even remember who else was on the show.  I've done it with DiPaolo, Alan Havey, and fucking, um, I did it with, I did it with  Itel, C.K., and DiPaolo.  That's a fucking great show.  Wow.  And Jim Jeffries.  Wow. 
[01:05:30]  And that's, yeah, that's when I first met Jim.  That's a great show.  It was a, who closed it?  Um, Louie, Louie closed it.  Uh, Jim went up first.  I think I went up second, or we, Vice for, oh, something like that.  DiPaolo hosted.  Okay.  Um, it was a, I think Itel went up last, or They Switched, or something like that.  It was fucking crazy.  I mean, every.  That's a great lineup.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  So, that's my, that's my favorite, my favorite show up there to do.  I enjoy it, but the schedule stinks, and it just becomes this routine, this thing you're 
[01:06:00]  doing obsessively every night, so.  Yeah, but no, the thing that's cool is nobody's there yet, so it's kind of just you, and a  couple comedians, and a little industry, so you kind of, I like, like I said, I like going  around the city, and hanging out, and it's, it's kind of like you guys are the kings of  the festival for that week, and then people start trickling in the next week.  But it doesn't, that's why I don't like it, because it doesn't mean anything, so I'm just  doing a bunch of dirty jokes in front of sold-out crowds for average money. 
[01:06:30]  But I mean, that's how I look at it.  It's fun, but I.  Yeah, but you're with, you're with your friends.  I'd rather just do the cellar in New York.  Really?  Much.  But, because I can work on other stuff.  But whatever, I enjoy the nasty show, and I've done it before, and I'll probably want  to do it again, because it is fun.  We should come up with a show.  We have one already.  Yeah, we should come up with like a, like a, we should do a virus show next year.  Well.  We, that would be fucking, they would, they would do that in a second.  Maybe.  Well, we'll see how it goes this year.  Yeah.  And they'd give you a big venue up there.  That'd be a blast. 
[01:07:00]  Voss, Keith, get everybody.  It's too bad we didn't do a Patrice fucking show this year.  Because Colin's going to be up there, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Montreal.  And you should do, I'm excited to do the hour show.  That was a fun.  I would do it, because the last time they did it in the training club.  Oh, really?  Like, there's a training club across the street from Club Soda.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, and all the, the girls become waitresses for your show that week.  G-U-R-L-S, yes. 
[01:07:30]  And, yeah, you get to meet them.  Were they nice?  Uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't, you know.  I would, I would like to do that and spend some time.  Montreal's a fun place, but I think it's an overrated city.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Sex-wise?  Eh, please.  Really?  Ooh, go to the strip club in Canada.  No, no, no, no.  Fuck off.  No, no, no.  The strip clubs, the strip clubs are bullshit.  Yeah, the sex scene's overrated.  The massage.  Dude, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm actually fucking raising my eyebrow to you. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  What am I thinking?  New York's the best for that.  I'm sure there's other places.  I have no desire to go to fucking Thailand and get a finger on my ass.  I just, there's nothing to me.  I want to be here with a bunch of jaded New York horse.  I have an announcement, too.  I have to make it because I tweeted it like a fucking dummy.  I'm the, I thought tickets were on sale today.  They go on sale next Friday.  The anti-social show that I'm doing with, it's Saturday, July 20th with Amy Schumer, 
[01:08:30]  Dave Attell, and Artie Lang.  It's in the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  It's sold out.  So we are doing a 10 p.m. show.  So this one will probably sell out as well.  And tickets go on sale next Friday.  But this one actually sold out fairly fast.  So that, this, this, you need a host for it?  I need money.  I'm hosting it.  Oh, shit.  I host it.  It's the greatest gig.  I host it.  I think it's, I don't know who, either Amy or Attell.  It's a very fun show.  We all do like 20 minutes. 
[01:09:00]  And then we come out at the end together.  It's a killer show.  And we improv for fucking like 10, 15 minutes.  You guys do improv?  We just talk on stage together.  No, not scene-wise.  You mean object?  object okay how about this you're a radio guy i'm a radio guy you have a big hit and you're a  fucking ex-drinker give me four things you hate besides us oh hey with the improv would be good  yeah we can no we just talk to the audience and it's fun like a q a that's how is the master at  those things dave dave is the master at fucking just riffing and being funny yeah um but it was 
[01:09:30]  funny he's fun to do that with too like me and him did shows in vegas together it was just it was a  david copperfield's thing comedy central had some thing where amy did one show jeselnik did another  and then dave and i did one and it was fun man like it you know i go on first i won't follow him  because a tell is too rapid fire like you know and it's like and it's funny rapid fire  and it's like a laugh it's like a fucking it's like an assault and but it's a brilliant assault 
[01:10:00]  and a funny assault right so it's like it's like you can't even when you when it tells on you hear  the audience fucking you gotta you gotta you gotta stop doing that too but you know yourself from  credit because you're developing a fucking weird habit like it's almost like i don't like you're  you're developing like i don't i can't follow i know you're a fucking killer dude i i but i feel  i killer terribly unfunny around the comedians yeah i like doing my own show and i'm comfortable doing  my own hour and i'm comfortable fucking having i don't like when i'm on the road i don't give a fuck  who opens for me i never care what as long as they're not stepping on my con like what i'm 
[01:10:30]  talking about i don't care how funny they are it means nothing but when i'm working with other  guys in my class or around i'm like i always get this thing where i can't follow them i suck  it's just this silly thing i mean i i understand it i definitely understand it but that that's in  your head too because you can definitely follow anybody you have the virus show that was cool you  went up at the end of that that was crazy i did close the one after bill burr got booed uh in philly that  one um yeah i had to go on after that but again yeah but that was about being a great show but part 
[01:11:00]  of it worked in my favor because bill's such a solid act and he had such an unfair experience with  them that going on after uh they all what here's why bill got booed that day because we were on  terrestrial and xm and the terrestrial audience didn't know bill yet they had just kind of started  listening and bill hadn't been around he was in la the xm audience knew him and loved him and that 
[01:11:30]  terrestrial audience just hadn't gotten to know him yet so they're like who is this guy but you  know had that been a year later yeah but bill murdered but bill also this i i love it that bill  didn't uh cater to that crowd right he actually you know i'm not going out there and fucking rah  i'm just doing what i do yeah and bill's jokes take if you listen to bill it takes a couple minutes  before you have to listen listen it's almost like the fuck is and then all of a sudden he's killing  like he gets into the meat of it and he's just annihilating the setup is kind of you know it takes 
[01:12:00]  a minute in front of 12 000 people have been tailgating for four hours right they don't have  the attention span they want let's go let's fucking go let's do this right now they would wait  because like because they all know bill yeah and they would be they would know his style that  would never happen again yeah but that was one reason that happened but yeah those shows were  different because i feel like it was well it was an opian anthony audience and yeah but that's the  show you're getting on these big shows too though right i guess yeah a lot of ona fans sure i mean 
[01:12:30]  look man it's interesting that you host the show that's a pretty cool thing that you go up first  and then well oh the anti-social i like hosting i actually like doing that and i'm a decent host  i move it along i'm comfortable doing that and i don't mind you know we're all doing 20 minutes  and uh gig arty's amazing dude when arty lang goes on last and arty doesn't like you know there's  certain guys i'm sure he doesn't want to follow but he never panics dude like you'll never see  arty lang fucking panic it's really interesting to watch like he if he gets nervous he doesn't show 
[01:13:00]  it he'll be in the back right before he goes on he's all unshaven fucking with his jacket on  his members only jacket he's yapping yeah fucking eagles rawr he's on stage like he's completely  himself on stage he just i really admire the fact that he just doesn't give a fuck i mean he cares  about his performance but he doesn't ever panic or go all right i gotta breathe you know arty could  literally be fucking baby wiping his asshole and have his walk-on music play and then just walk on 
[01:13:30]  stage yeah and kill he's really really interesting how he does not get afraid yeah i did that i did a  show with him and florentine and stuttering john those shows yeah i did those too and i remember  you know everybody went up and killed florentine killed i killed it was just like what and he went  up late and he just walked out didn't give a fuck had him in two seconds and just stepped on their  necks the whole time by the end of it he was fucking trashed that was when they used to just bring  shots up during his set and throw candy bars at him for some reason remember that no i i i didn't do 
[01:14:00]  with arty when i did it was uh with modi and stuttering john and someone else melrose larry  green all these howard guys were there i've always had good success in front of howard audiences they  haven't given me any shit like i've always had a good uh like i when i've done those shows with  arty when when we were you know especially when there's much more his audience than mine  um it was never bad stern fans are never bad to me so right i don't know why why would they be  yeah you know because there was a whole weird thing with the two shows yeah you know it's the past 
[01:14:30]  absolutely we're all americans yeah it is in the past but it's still this you get the hardcores that  are very most people don't give a fuck they'll they'll flip back and forth they'll listen to us  in the morning howard in the afternoon or vice versa yeah what were you gonna say travis  no oh you just breathed i thought you were gonna say something i listened to howard movie what get  out yeah wait a second i listen just to make sure he's not stepping on what you guys are talking  about fair enough bob he's not stealing bits fair enough that's what's interesting we can't get 
[01:15:00]  somebody in because they're doing howard and i understand that stern wants them to do he can't  wait for that day neither can we believe it no but it's it's uh like a lot of big guests you know  or guests that he gets the the the rule is or the unwritten rule is that like hey can you just  not do opian anthony the day before no not do opian just don't do him the day before because they want  to feel like howard gets them first and i and that doesn't even bother me because the guy makes 
[01:15:30]  fucking 80 million a year and when you're negotiating you want to go look this is what i bring to the  table i get these so it's like yeah whatever we had scott thornton uh or thorson thorson  thorson yesterday and those videos are online by the way they are online yeah you can get  them there and you just look them up on youtube we've been getting good play on radar online has  been very good to the show lately they've been like quoting the show and and it's kind of nice i guess  they listen but there's some to scott thornton with you know he was uh the guy from matt damon  played and behind the candelabra yeah and we did we had like 45 minutes with him yesterday and he 
[01:16:00]  was really good and some people were like he was full of shit look if he exaggerated a thing or two  maybe but there's too much documented for all that to be bullshit a drama queen exaggerating  yeah but exactly really but i mean he really was he said that he never fucked liveraci that was a  mistake i don't believe and i don't believe that he never kissed him but uh he said he said lee would  just suck his cock and i asked him how big was his dick and he like maybe he like put his fingers  on the microphone like he had a huge dick he said really uh but it was lumpy because he would get 
[01:16:30]  silicone injected into it and he said he didn't like suck he didn't suck it because he said it was  uncircumcised which was gross because he couldn't get the skin all the way over the head it was  really funny to hear him talking about that and i think michael didn't say michael jackson used to  fuck him in the ass yeah he said michael jackson was on top michael was a top with a small dick  that was what he said he said that yeah and uh he said that the family has not sued him for all the  you know they were going to at one point but he took two lie detector tests and passed  and michael wouldn't take one so the jacksons might have backed off of that i mean that's according 
[01:17:00]  to scott thorson so he's wait a minute he fuck he i think i fuck mike he said michael jackson  fucked him he never fucked mike no i think he said michael fucked him and did mike suck his cock  i don't you know what we didn't get into that because we had so much to talk about  because he was involved in those john hall was wonderland murders yeah he really had a lot of  fucking would you let michael jackson suck your cock yeah for the story sure just why not  yeah i think you got to you have to yeah out of obligation for the radio show i would do that 
[01:17:30]  purely for the show i'd let mike suck my dick yeah yeah purely for the radio show just to  look down and take a nice vine video yeah and i wouldn't film guys guess what i'm doing  that's creepily that'd be like hey and just go i would go like i would go normal hilarious  you don't think scott was at all full of shit no you might have been you might have exaggerated  yeah but um and there's so much stuff that you know is true that's yeah i mean some of it was  obviously true a lot of it was obviously true we have no phones today do people want to call in 
[01:18:00]  they can call in and chat i think people are used to the uh like when you and first of all  you know you guys even when it's a regular show you only take three phone calls a day yeah and  when you and ann are doing a show you take zero phone calls so yeah if anybody wants to call in  and talk to us or congratulate bobby or you know uh i'm not going to do an advice show because it's  all of us here but i still technically owe the company one so if anybody wants to call in if  anybody has one question i will count the minutes of that and that will go towards what's what's the 
[01:18:30]  phone number eight six six wow one wow yeah if anybody wants to call in and i know some people  will call them what are you guys doing what are you guys talking about we don't know yeah we're just  yapping we didn't have to do any show why am i being defensive don't talk about scott torson  excuse me i'm clearing my throat but i got a i got a tweet from the guy abu something who's a big  i think he's he's always gets mad when we bash islam but he's a good fan and he said that he saw  man of steel and he said it was a masterpiece abu salam i think it was a masterpiece yeah 
[01:19:00]  that's a big heavy yeah that's a heavy word i don't know i've heard bob i'm right jim i'm right  here oh sorry i've heard a couple i've heard i've heard different things about i know iraq saw it  oh iraq he did what'd you see what'd you say yeah he just decided not it was great  oh you did like it yeah it was fantastic but was it like like the like uh the batman  return no no no no no he's saying it was like they made superman dark it's darker it's not as 
[01:19:30]  clean cut happy uh really you know uh polished all-american superman my thing is like and did  you see the last superman movie they made i did it killed the franchise for me like i couldn't be  less excited about this superman movie because the last one with kevin spacey and all them was  horrible did you come see that with us yeah and we trees and we sat with uh sandy kenyon yeah  i was there for me you did you go yeah didn't patrice yell some shit out yeah yeah yeah same thing 
[01:20:00]  it was the same scenario with cloverfield i remember that yeah i don't know why we don't why don't we  do that anymore go to the screenings all together it was a horrible movie so bad and that's why i  couldn't like it completely turned me off of these superman movies yeah it sucked and i hate  i hated the uh the boat scene that horrible fucking sucked horrible i don't even remember  what you're talking about the boat i've completely blocked it out of my memory but i've heard i've  heard this one has more backstory yeah this one actually has a plot to it and everything the 
[01:20:30]  first 20 minutes doesn't even have superman it's just krypton right spoiler alert jeez wow  yeah come on i don't give a shit yeah what else is there does he have a cape not till way when you  say that you should smash the glass i don't give a shit i don't give a fuck yeah say fudge  i don't give a fudge was uh how was the guy who played it though was he good yeah because you didn't  recognize him so he didn't take you out like you believe that he's the character so he's not like 
[01:21:00]  russell crowe looks like he-man it's superman yeah so he kind of takes you out of the movie  it's the real superman clapping your hands soup soup soup where's my coffee that guy come in  hey what do you mean what do you mean russell crowe look like hercules well the suit that he's wearing  is makes him a lot bigger than he really is so you're not really believing that he's the movies yeah i  know but it's it's an awkward looking and did they explain what happens to him when he comes to earth 
[01:21:30]  and why he has the powers does he because yeah just they just briefly they mentioned well he's  from krypton yeah and they they explain that but he doesn't know all his powers right no superman  doesn't know until way later right and then the the sun is his son this is uh this is what this is  uh you just make shit up what are you talking about nothing to do with shit you don't know anything  about superman do you the sun that gives him his power no it doesn't and the last one it did 
[01:22:00]  remember he had to go up to the sun you don't know shit about superman do you he had to go to  the sun a minute ago you were like does he know how he got his powers i told you i already blocked  that movie out of my head am i right about the sun the yellow sun gives him his power the yellow sun  gives him his power the yellow sun the sun that's our sun i don't call it the yellow sun because it's  our sun they call it krypton has a red sun yeah the yellow sun gives him his power wait a minute so  superman how many reboots after christopher reevo 17 this is the second yeah i'm sorry they're just 
[01:22:30]  remaking the same you know they're not the last one wasn't even a reboot it was supposed to be  like a continuation okay yeah this is an actual retelling of everything but and they did it they  did it with batman and they pulled it off yeah that's true they pulled it off in an amazing way  and they're doing the same exact thing with this one yeah uh uh to uh you know to explain it  that superman returns got 75 on rotten tomatoes it was horrible that piece of shit yeah it was 
[01:23:00]  that superman returns was supposed to be in the christopher reeves storyline eric's right it's the  continuation yeah it was supposed to continue after the second he's younger than christopher  reeves oh so you're ignoring superman you're ignoring three and four and this was supposed to  be like superman left and all of a sudden came back after richard prior that one never existed  yeah poor guy but this is a is a retelling they change a couple things that doesn't take away from  the original story and they do they kind of pull a star trek the new reboot of star trek where they 
[01:23:30]  give you enough of the original story but then twist it a little bit so they can change the timeline  the star trek reboot was good although uh gene wilder who said something interesting last night  when they were talking about reboots somebody asked him about the willy wonka remake and he  said that he took it as an insult he said it's insulting i thought i i heard that he he left the  country because of that like maybe to england because of that movie no that's what i heard now he uh  he and he doesn't like he said he likes johnny depp he's a good actor but he doesn't he didn't like 
[01:24:00]  what timothy who did you do that uh what's him burton he said he doesn't like tim burton as a director  he goes at least i heard he started believing it in in um i got nothing these are the same as your  superman theories i have a question we have people on the phone i would love to talk to you yeah we  got a lot of people where is this guy i asked for coffee 50 minutes ago what the fuck is he doing  what's going on ken i don't know i'm not trying to be a prima donna but i'm fucking sleepy  we had i asked for coffee 50 minutes ago and this guy's not back yet  oh hang on your order okay let me hit the button for you go ahead he's getting the entire order 
[01:24:30]  of coffee and food all right so he's going to three different locations  you couldn't send somebody else out too  if you want coffee from here i'll go get it right now all right i'm fucking tired all right who's on  um paul in north carolina hey hey guys i will not let paul near my kid yay i'll watch him go ahead 
[01:25:00]  go to the opera hello question for uh for jim i know you guys are face to face with these guys  how do you know that they're telling the truth because uh jim forson yesterday he was very  believable and i remember uh you know damien echols a few weeks back very very believable and you just  you kind of know or get a sense you guys are telling the truth i mean how do you know  you know you don't always know honestly like you you i'm sure we've been bullshitting before and  maybe this guy exaggerated you develop a certain set like you know the big tucker max story when we 
[01:25:30]  had tucker max in and we had that big fight with tucker max what was the fight about i didn't know  about that oh yeah the author we liked tucker max and what happened was he was telling some very  funny stories and then all of a sudden opie me and anthony just knew he lied he was lying  and it was insulting that we felt like he was talking to us like we were dummies like  like he wasn't saying admitting to the fact that he was being playful and exaggerating he was acting 
[01:26:00]  like these were real stories and right it just kind of was insulting so we wound up getting it got  very uncomfortable and opius big balls he was just playing this clip going liar liar and that was  a big argument but whatever uh so you don't always know but you can tell there's a big difference  like when tucker max is telling these stories that obviously don't add up versus like burt kreischer  telling stories that are true you know i mean and he's got details to back them up and you can tell  the way people are saying and i wonder there might even be exaggerations in burt stories i don't know 
[01:26:30]  but an exaggeration here and there is one thing like scott thorsten may have exaggerated certain points  but there's i'm sorry to this day tucker max was on what like six or seven years ago yeah he still  has a what happened to you on opie and anthony in his faq on his website because it got so much  like internet buzz and he'll make it look like we were just trying he'll never say they were irritated  that i was bullshitting them or that i was telling a frat boy story and i'm you know i don't say he's 
[01:27:00]  an untalented right i'm sure he's a great writer i know and we were obviously a good writer he's a  funny storyteller he's a good story that we were enjoying him but there was something about because  we don't like when guys do bits and stuff it was almost like you're talking to a guy and then you  realize oh he's doing a bit and it just got annoying right not that we never exaggerate not  that we don't bullshit but it was like oh what the fuck are you doing what are we at good morning  zoo it was fiction it was at least it sounded like fiction it was irritating yeah i think 
[01:27:30]  i think scott thorson might have been bullshitting on some stuff he might have exaggerated absolutely  he definitely struck me as the type that would say sure whatever for publicity his time frames might  have been bullshit yeah and some of the detailing like you know yeah i didn't believe that he didn't  kiss lee i didn't believe that he didn't fuck him but i you know he obviously lived at liberaci like  when he's on and off for 17 years like i believe of course yeah that's documented didn't he say he  wasn't gay too yeah he might have been he might and that might be true because he wouldn't let uh 
[01:28:00]  liberaci fuck him in the ass and he said he fucked loretta lynn oh yeah he fucked loretta lynn we  should have got into that i fucked loretta lynn congratulations bob thanks we we should have got  into the loretta lynn we just didn't have time thank you um and there was also uh what else did  he say the lead singer acdc got my fucking coffee for me yeah he said he said uh he said he was  hanging out with charlie manson in jail yeah was he telling the truth i don't know about that it  would seem like they would isolate charlie manson yeah he's in san quentin i believe so thank you 
[01:28:30]  sir we just don't know who's uh who else we got uh phil in virginia filling it with what hey jimmy  bob hi what's up buddy how you guys doing today buddy hey uh that that interview was fucking amazing  because you know you get a lot of people in there that that don't tell the truth and that hold things  back and that guy did not lie and he well i'm not gonna say he didn't lie but he didn't he  definitely didn't hold anything back i mean come on michael jackson was a top with a small dick i 
[01:29:00]  mean who else is going to tell you that but that's also i mean that's his whole deal it's not like he's  he's not a guy who's when people hold things back it's because they're trying to sell something else  like all he does is talk about people who are famous for doing something i think the point he's making  is pretty specific you know with uh with details i mean i mean i mean great liars that's what they  do they're very detail but to to to be uh to to say these you know that's pretty specific to say he's 
[01:29:30]  a small dick and he likes to fuck in the ass you that's the exact opposite what you would actually  think michael jackson would do you think michael jackson would like you know just like to get  jerked off with a foot right you know what i mean right but and and also the movie and i've and i've  watched it now twice and jimmy there's a point in that movie where michael does like i swear to god  and i agree with you a thousand percent that he if that had been a theatrical release he was he would 
[01:30:00]  win an oscar but there's a point in that movie where he uh you know when he calls him at the end  when he's dying and he goes scott are you okay are you okay and it's the acting in that is so  masterful because you can tell he's not concerned about the guy's health he just wants to find out  if he's got the disease so he can go this foggy gave me aids you know do you think so i don't know  i i thought he was actually worried about scott i i don't think he was i really i really think he 
[01:30:30]  was looking at that point that he was going to use him one last time he could go yeah again this  this guy gave me this disease oh see i didn't pick that up i picked up when michael douglas called  him and you got there and he looked like fucking et on the bathroom floor um yeah i fucking i really  believed he was concerned about him because lee like liberace knew that he was the one getting  fucked in the ass he knew that scott wasn't getting fucked in the ass and he wasn't going to announce 
[01:31:00]  it anyway like he's trying yeah exactly yeah i disagree so i think that i think that was genuine  concern because he knew he was a dead man and he wanted to he's like just come visit me i want you  are my favorite he wanted to just see him again um and he also knew that he was fucking young  liberace knew what he was doing yeah um so who knows maybe you're right but i didn't get that  thank you very much thanks goodbye make the font bigger trev jim in pennsylvania hi where hey what's up  guys welcome jimmykins hey i want to let you know my brother-in-law did time out in california and he's 
[01:31:30]  been through all those prisons and he was in coracan prison that's where scott said he was and saw  manson and that's where manson is so that could be true and i doubt manson's uh like in protective  custody or anything because that'd be he'd be down 23 hours a day and i just don't think he would go for  that i mean he's probably saw him in coracan okay maybe so i mean that's something you know

[01:37:30]  porn sites like clitty.com to find them and you they're all fake oh like even the porn you never  see a real one on a in a porn video you can't are you i mean you would imagine that there'd be a porn  video with the hermaphrodite and then a legitimate one but it's it's it's all it's like a fake cock  i think it's just legend i think it's just a legend i don't think they're really out there  yeah i don't know jamie lee curtis disagrees yeah i've heard that she is and i and i've always uh 
[01:38:00]  who knows man i don't know don't forget lady gaga she's not a big beautiful pussy lady gaga's  sexy she's a big fat puss all right thank you thank you for the call buddy appreciate it that's  weird though i've thought about that yeah i wonder if they're real too i don't know i've never seen a  real one i've never seen a real hermaphrodite i'm sure they are and it's hard to it's hard to find  and the ones that are on porn sites when they come it comes out like you know a honey bun syrup it's  just fake dicks and shit you know what i mean all right sam just pick one what the fudge what the 
[01:38:30]  fudge indeed john stupid in florida john yeah hello hey buddy hey what's going on hey jimmy  thanks for coming in man sure bobby congratulations bro thank you brother hey uh i want to ask you  jimmy about uh team mom there man did she did she get to you when you when she came in there or what  i mean she i thought you guys would have thrown out of there i couldn't stand her yeah she was i'll  tell you what i had heard that she was kind of bitchy but but i i with her i say this she's 21 
[01:39:00]  and she's you know and then i was reading the prep she's the boyfriend that she was dating  but the baby was killed two weeks before the baby was born or something so she's kind of had a rough  go of it i did not believe her necessarily about the porn but i'd only seen a brief bit of it so i  wasn't sure but i felt like why why go after her because again she's an easy target like it's not  hard to beat up on a 21 year old and we only had her for a few minutes so now she didn't really get to 
[01:39:30]  me um you know because i knew that if we got into it i was going to be really brutal but it was like  for what she wasn't being awful that was she was like a little bit of standoffish but nah she didn't  get to be dude and i didn't want to be mean to her yeah i know opie said he was a little tired and  that's why he went you know a little easy on her and all just wish you came in and going oh i'm not  all about that you know what are you about why are you here yeah but again it's like i i hate attacking  porn chicks i fucking hate it because they're easy targets like here's what they do i've been on 
[01:40:00]  porn shoots that's a hard fucking job people i love when people say oh what do you just do porn  a good no one first of all no one says that to the male porn actors and you know i've watched them  do it it's fucking hard it's not a love making thing where it's you two there's a crew around you  and there's a director going all right come on let's go let's go give me some more give me some  action give me some action and and this guy's cock stays hard and this chick's pussy is getting hit  with a battering ram and she's taking it so i i really believe it or not i have a tremendous 
[01:40:30]  amount of respect for porn actors because what they do is really difficult and in this fucking  phony culture we judge them and act like they're shitty and they are by far the biggest grossing  movies on the planet is porn not gross not anymore maybe not anymore with fucking free porn on the  internet okay right fair enough with free porn but you know what i'm saying yeah they were the biggest  video sellers every piece of new technology we use it for porn and again now but you go online 
[01:41:00]  you'll find a lot of superman stuff you'll find a lot more porn shit online or dirty pictures and  you will pictures of superman or spider-man we all love it so anyone that does it uh i'm not going  to judge them on it and uh because i've jerked off to it too many times and it's given me too many  hours of entertainment to be anything but nice to them um i like porn chicks sometimes they're  cunty and we go after them and it's fair to go after them because they're being bitchy and shitty  when they're fucking holier than thou and they think they're better than it's like it's like when you 
[01:41:30]  don't realize you know what we do we realize that we're pieces of garbage on stage that's why we get  away with what we we talk about but when a porn girl thinks she's actually better they're you've  sucked dick for a living yeah sometimes it has to come down to that because they're they're a  little fucking uppity you know what i mean well you know who was uh who's a good guest bailey jay  is a fun guest and because bailey jay does not pretend to be like you know bailey's honest she  does pretend to be something she's oh that's a good point yeah you know that's the worst example 
[01:42:00]  i ever yeah but i mean as a person she doesn't like when you talk to her she's like yeah i got a  male mentality with this but i'm you know she's very honest and open and talks like that and doesn't  take herself too seriously so people love bailey jay's a transsexual and this is a really  hardcore male demo and our listeners really like bailey jay like that should be an indicator to  everyone out there and a lot of our listeners do not like transsexual sex if you're open and you're  honest about yourself people who listen to this show will pretty much like you because that's kind 
[01:42:30]  of what our listeners are used to is at least yeah more than a lot of shows so that's my advice i mean  you've done that too i mean you talk about your sexual fucking deviance i mean most guys  usually i'm from boston i you know we those are you fucking faggot you know but everybody accepts  it for me in the mirror yeah but you're you're on you're so honest about it you've made it okay  yeah and you made it so comfortable for us that you know some of us have actually fucking watched it 
[01:43:00]  yeah yeah some of us have actually fucking jerked off to it some of us have actually fucking got  addicted to it i got so mad at your chip one the other day when you were watching the tranny porn and you  didn't tell us what what tranny you were watching oh i know so now i'm trying to fucking figure out  what voice it was yeah oh chip oh chip was like this is a big fucking pecker on that girl  all right let's see uh let's talk about uh somebody wants to know what bobby's first thought bob in  texas what's up buddy i gotta tell you i can never tell my wife uh or my daughter what i thought the 
[01:43:30]  very first time i saw my uh little girl's head pop out uh bobby was talking about peeking around the  corner right when he heard when the baby was starting to actually come out when i looked at  my daughter's head come out it looked like her eyes and her nose were exposed and she was looking  straight up and all i could think of all i could think of was darth vader and luke skywalker taking  the helmet off because her head was all scrunched up and smushed together and her nose and eyes  and if i if my wife ever knew uh that i thought that dude i didn't i didn't see thank god i didn't 
[01:44:00]  see any recognizable features of a face i just saw the the hair but if i had saw if i had saw  eyeballs and a nose oh my god dude like that cartoon character that always looks over mountains  with just his half his head holding on with his hand with his nose sticking over oh yeah i always thought  that was ziggy but that's not his name it's uh i forget what it is i forget i'm sorry talking to 
[01:44:30]  mike dude i was manning the camera when i saw that i actually i think in the recording i wasn't like  showing the video i was like recording the wall when i was looking but uh but you could hear me  say luke i am your father like kind of under my breath well you know what's so funny that births now  like when i grew up in my you know and before that you didn't get the the record of this my kid's  gonna see the second he came out and a million photos after that you you you just with my fucking  phone i'm right there just taking i have video of right before he came out right when he came out 
[01:45:00]  i mean our kids are going to be able to see all kinds of crazy shit that we never saw we don't have  a history of ourselves we don't know what the fuck happened it happened you don't remember it our  kids are gonna actually go to watch a video and the photo album all this crazy shit on the computer  now because of uh technology technology is crazy well you wait till they start they'll figure out  a way to teach things kids and kids things in the womb with like computer stuff what we know they'll  eventually figure that out where the kid won't be able to know any much but you the kid will be 
[01:45:30]  able to communicate i played music to him i have this thing where you you have it around the belly  and it has speakers and you plug it in while he was in the womb and you i played him uh acdc and  classical music and uh wow though for the whole nine months that he was in there we didn't do a  microphone that you strapped onto his stomach and like listen to a heartbeat at night stuff that was  nuts that was absolutely nuts yeah that little life man that little life is awesome yeah it's crazy  it's fucking crazy the craziest part to me when the kid was in the stomach was watching like a hand 
[01:46:00]  push up or a foot rollo and you see the imprint on the belly and the fucking thing just kind of  it looked like somebody's trying to get out of her stomach yeah that fucked me like a horror movie  yeah that was fucked up but all right man thanks for calling brother hey no problem have a good one  um let's see what do you think okay oh i'm not gonna say um no i'm not about my show times uh 
[01:46:30]  let's see how about uh let's go to the guy joe in new york needs help losing weight  hey what's up jimmy joe what's up buddy jimmy i've been working out for like three months  and uh i've kind of plateaued at this point and i know you lost a ton of weight so i was curious  if you did if you took any supplements or no if you just went to the gym and you're eating right  that's it and the plateauing i was for a long time just doing the elliptical machine  i i just i have a bad right ankle but it was it was a part of it was just i just i didn't want to 
[01:47:00]  commit to it so i would just do the elliptical every day and you lose a little weight and then  you plateau and your body gets used to it so you have to do something different um switch up the  workouts where'd you go to um well that's when i started going regularly like uh just myself and  going to this big gym with all these floors on it and going to every floor and just doing different  things pull-ups i would do push-ups i would do crunches i would do fucking curls and all i would  just use the machines sometimes you work the same body part two days in a row which you're not 
[01:47:30]  supposed to do sometimes you don't sometimes you do free weights sometimes like just keep  mixing it up but even then i would get into a routine so getting trainers has helped a lot because  that you know the one advantage to having two is they have more availability the disadvantage is  sometimes they'll work you the same twice in a row but it doesn't matter i'm like my body has no  idea what's coming today um so i would suggest doing that go online you gotta be careful too though  because like i went to that boxing training with keith and all them yeah and i fucked up my knees 
[01:48:00]  because they didn't have me on like hey fatso routine they had me on you know these guys are  already in shape i'm working out with amy and keith yeah doing the same shit they're doing it  fucked up my knees yeah no i don't keith has been bugging me for a long time to go to that i don't  like to work out with other people you could do it now you could you could definitely my cardio is  decent not amazing um thank these really weird stuff with my breath with breathing um but i i  the one who i'm seeing today works me fucking rough she's brutal i was like oh um so just go maybe get 
[01:48:30]  a trainer if you could if you if you got the money a little bit of disposable income get a trainer if  not go online i found a great ab exercise online so you go online and find exercises hey the stronger  ab better this and there's fucking 500 videos of everything online right so that's what i did and  uh just keep doing different stuff dude and and and you'll you'll your plateau will break i think  just make sure you're eating right and don't eat shitty at night if you can help it all right cool  thanks guys i appreciate it all right buddy let's go to joe in new york who's uh has had an issue 
[01:49:00]  with during birth hi how you doing boy hello what's up joe so uh i got three kids uh all of them  were big 9 14 9 8 and 9 6 and wow first one was born she was 9 14 jesus  so i'm in there and you know she pops out and this little tiny indian doctor she's you know they  let me cut the cord and all that then she's like oh it looks like you've torn a little bit and i 
[01:49:30]  fucking look down oh god and my wife's pussy looks like it already looks bad anyway but it's flayed open  like a butterfly fucking pork chop because fucking home run joe my daughter's head split her pussy  almost down to her fucking ass fucking hilarious and this woman just starts sewing her back up and  i'm just sitting there weeping looking at my fucking prized possession get sewn up like a piece of 
[01:50:00]  fucking me yeah i didn't have that dude my kid was six six nine and then she a little tiny bit i  didn't you had a fucking basketball come out of your vagina dude they're not fucking lying and i'm not  packing a lot so it's hard to fill that thing i don't understand why you look though just don't  fucking look man you get once you've desensitized desensitize yourself to that visual you're gonna  fuck yourself up you shouldn't have looked god damn it i'll never get that view out of my head  man yeah fuck that no i mine mine mine came out nice and easy like i think she got like a couple 
[01:50:30]  stitches that's it nothing nothing ripped i mean that would suck if you heard it yeah this one was  slayed wide open oh god thank you very much i'm sorry about your wife's veg oh no wait tmi  chip what the fuck so much information i mean i get it dumb cock sucker shut up chip  fuck you piece of shit what's up for will pen will will pen i don't know won't it right will it 
[01:51:00]  right i should go to break on that one go ahead will what's up fat chit hey buddy um yeah jimmy  were you ever bullied in school because there have been a lot of bullying incidents at my school  very little um i probably should have been bullied but i was i mean a minor amount but no  i was uh when i was really young i think i was i had some weird stuff happen when i was a kid 
[01:51:30]  my child had such a fucking vague memory boy something terrible i'm forgetting but uh high  school no because i was funny and when you're funny i make the burnouts laugh i made the jocks laugh  and um nobody wants to be in that everyone's ego is very delicate in high school so the one thing i  could do that they couldn't do is i could verbally humiliate them in front of people and nobody wants  to take the chance that you're going to do that that you're going to beat them that way like i believe  me they would have murdered me but that there was that like little give and take like i won't humiliate 
[01:52:00]  you if you don't fucking totally dominate me physically like an alpha so i was not bullied that much  but it's only because i was funny good because for me i was unemployed a lot when i was younger but  then um when i was in ninth grade during the summer i went to italy so everyone's got to say f you  because i'm used to live in europe so the fuck does that help anything you should have been bullied  yeah what do you mean oh you say made fun of you because you lived in europe no because when i was 
[01:52:30]  younger i was i have a asperger syndrome i'm slightly autistic but um when i was in um my dad's um  company bought a company over in europe so whenever i'm in um class and some kids are making fun of me  i said well here's something you've never done you asshole i used to live in europe oh you had  something okay well i mean look and you so you kind of came to the table with an experience they didn't  have and they went where yeah you know kids today let me ask you knowing you have asperger's 
[01:53:00]  what is that how does that affect asperger's is a personality thing right like how does that affect  you what do you what do you do that quote unquote normal people don't do that that you all fuck this  is my asperger's um because it's it's i can't really read like social like facial expressions and  things like that but um one of the cool things it does help me is um i have a lot of support like 
[01:53:30]  my dad's bosses they've helped me a lot they've helped me a lot they've um even have sent um a  group of my good friends to camp okay for kids with asperger's do you now having asperger's do you  feel emotions like i don't know since you don't know how other people feel them do you feel emotions  or do you just understand how emotions are supposed to look when you feel them i feel  emotion you do okay so you get sad and you get happy at the same shit most people do yeah oh okay 
[01:54:00]  but it's hard for you to express or do you say brutal blunt things no okay i think kenny's a  little asperger it's my opinion yeah yeah i think so too so how's the show selling not good all right  i understand you had to give me the information because you're my mom she's actually uh she hates  the show but uh i love it why does your mom hate the show i don't hate the show hi how are you miss  oh so asperger's makes your boy lie i say he's a dishonest young man now how old are you how old 
[01:54:30]  are you sir i'm 17 okay now let me ask the mom because you you see what it's like his asperger's  how does it affect like him compare like how how what exactly uh is it that lets you know he has  asperger's well he's he's very intelligent and and really normal that socially he doesn't express  himself the same way how is he different for do you have any other kids i have three okay so how  does he express himself differently than another kid mostly he's a little more introverted okay and 
[01:55:00]  uh sometimes maybe you know doesn't pick up on cues from other people and it's much harder you  know to make friends and interact a lot he interacts better with older people so he's not good at picking  up on social subtle subtle social cues exactly like if you were out with him and say uh there was a  couple at the table and the husband was jewish and he might be but let's you let's just say something 
[01:55:30]  like that and your son like are you guys jewish no okay just say your son was saying something like  yeah i saw this movie on jews and and then you're like well you know like you're trying to get him  away from it because you know this lady's husband is jewish he wouldn't pick up on that and he'd  continue okay he would never make that joke because he's very accepting but i don't mean that joke  it's just an example but it could be that kind of thing yes yes point where you say that though  because it is a huge fan of got to use them wait there you go no he got into thinking i asked 
[01:56:00]  what color people were all the time oh really good for him are you guys lying in bed together  yes it's a weird mother-son asperger's call yeah what the no because you know who has asperger's  voss does he oh my god that voss is the worst like you'll say something and he's like why voss  and like bonnie is like kicked him under the table and he said things like why are you kicking me  yeah all right thank you guys actually i had surgery when i was when i was in eighth grade so  and they had to put a cadaver bone in my foot so never a cadaver bone in your foot why

[02:03:30]  put the mic on  it is on  oh i can't put my headphones on  it's the chipper show  it's not the chipper show  we're here too  it's the chipper show  i'm just riffing and telling stories  telling a few lies  telling a few lies  why were you lying  yeah just telling some fibs  like what  i don't know  i remember one time i told someone i put blueberries on my oatmeal  that i really had strawberries  and i told him like a week later  i'm like remember i told you i had blueberries 
[02:04:00]  like yeah  like i ate strawberries  cocksucker  he'll fucking fucked up over that  jim what the fuck man  that's mean  he's lying about it  he never did it  he never did that  he was lying about that too  yeah he lies a lot  he's got no friends  who's on the phones  we have two people  they have two people  from lenny from long island  uh  yeah okay  lenny  hey guys  if the asperger dude  was fighting me in the hallway  and told me that  yeah but i lived in italy  fucking home run  yeah 
[02:04:30]  this guy lenny knows  the fucking home run  and then he followed it up  and said  you know  when they make palio cheese  oh  i'm fucking close the school down  fuck yeah lenny  i would have said to him  you used to live in europe  why don't you go back there  or something  on a big ship  next thing we hear  is a truck horn  all right thank you lenny  for the call  wait wait wait  fellas real quick  yes sir  when brewer was in last week  it came across  as some awkward battle  with anthony 
[02:05:00]  did that come across  more awkward  than it actually was  in studio  you know it's weird  it was funny to hear them  joking about it  and of course  i was egging it on  ooh  oh man  like i loved it  but then it definitely  got real  but yeah  people get annoyed  at each other  during arguments  but it didn't feel  that awkward  no i didn't care  i mean uh  what do i care  if they argue  like his friends  are gonna argue  sometimes  it's not like  it was a personal  argument like  hey your wife is this  or i don't like you  because you're not funny  but when two guys  are arguing about an issue 
[02:05:30]  like gun control  abortion  religion  it's the issue  they're arguing about  as long as it doesn't  get really personal  and i know those guys  like and respect each other  so no i don't give a fuck  dude i've seen so many  real arguments  and so many arguments  with comedians and shit  it's never awkward for me  right i was wondering  if that relationship  was like  they were playing that  up a little  or did it come across  as it was  they were in that moment  getting annoyed with each other  they were getting annoyed  with each other's point of view  and thought brewer was  fucking stupid 
[02:06:00]  and brewer was  it was stupid  but again they're friends  and that happens  there was nothing more  to it after that  after the show  they were just talking  and laughing  and you know  it was the same  as it always is  and on a follow up  to that jim  i know a lot of times  your point is  a little bit more  of the liberal side  let's say  when it's an argument  against anthony  which is tough not to be  yeah because he is  more conservative  i tend to at times  play devil's advocate  because i do miss anthony  right now  yeah  but uh  you know  if somebody was arguing  totally against guns  i would take up 
[02:06:30]  the argument for guns  too  because i try to be  uh  yeah  compared to anthony  i'm a bit more liberal  yes  sorry sir  that's fine  that's the sense  i got was  is it all devil's advocate  or is every time  your opinion  a complete 180  from anthony  it's not a 180  because anthony  anthony is a definable  conservative  like ant takes a very  very hard stance  on most things  he's liberal socially  like when it comes  to the zimmerman case  like when it comes  to the media  reporting black 
[02:07:00]  on white crime  i agree 100%  with anthony  we are completely  on the same page  when it comes to  the press  and the way  they don't cover things  like when we talk  about trayvon martin  and george zimmerman  um  i don't totally  disagree with that  but there's other  the other side  i'm trying to look at  too  because i'm not 100%  with zimmerman  um  you know what i mean  so it's not always  devil's advocate  a lot of times  i'm just  say from the middle  i'm a little bit  uh  to the right  but anthony's  much farther to the right  that's all it is  i get that  i get that 
[02:07:30]  you guys keep up  the good work  okay thanks  but ant's a fun guy  to debate with though  because ant's so smart  that you know  when you're  when you're fucking  going back and forth  with anthony  it's never  like i'm never mad at him  but you're debating  a brilliant guy  you know  and i know i'm debating  a brilliant fucking guy  so um  there's times where  anthony will make a  he made a great point  i forget we were  talking about recently  but uh  i just had to go  fuck that's a good point  like you know  sometimes you gotta say  that's the problem  with arguing  people don't say things  like alright  you're right about that  everyone digs in  and gets so 
[02:08:00]  100% about winning  the argument  and about making  the point  that even if  somebody makes a good  uh  raises a good point  they don't acknowledge it  so i think that  ant and i kind of  do that for each other  i had a homeless guy  make a good point  the other night  in an argument  i got in a fight  it was at 12 o'clock  the night the baby  came home from the hospital  and i was walking the dogs  and a homeless guy  kicked kelby  like you know  i don't need  like purposely walk up  and boot him  fucking 10 feet away  but i just heard him 
[02:08:30]  he walked by  and i heard kelby yelp  and i snapped  i was like  what the fuck  he kicking my  and he came at me  he's like  fuck you  we were screaming  at each other  like you fucking  kick an animal  you fucking idiot  and he's like  i didn't think  i meant to kick  your fucking animal  i mean  at the top of our lungs  about to fucking  throw fists  and then uh  i was on my phone  at the time  telling somebody  about the baby  blah blah blah  and he goes  you shouldn't have  been on your  fucking phone  you should be  paying attention  to your fucking dogs 
[02:09:00]  and i went  yeah it's a good point  i was just  i was like  yeah it's a good point  you know what  you fucking homeless  piece of shit  he's a bum  yeah he's a bum  and then you know  what he did  he called  he fucking  pulled the race card  on me  he goes  the reason why  you fucking  you don't like  black people  and he started  screaming that  i hated black people  and and  like i'm a racist  he just called me  a racist out of the blue  i didn't even know  what the fuck to do  i was in shock  i was like  what the fuck  the only thing  a white guy can do  is actually be racist  racist at that point 
[02:09:30]  right  right right right  it's crazy  um  we have samantha  in buffalo  i'm only going  there because  she's a woman  we finally have  a girl  call her bob  you have one  we have a woman  calling  let's wait  let's wait to see  it's not sam  get it  i'm here  oh it's a girl  hi samantha  well they call me  sam anyway  hey sammy  you sound cute  you sound cute  as hell  uh thanks  how tall are you  i just uh  i just wanted to  tell you that  wait a minute

[02:18:30]  from huntington i love you guys  i listen every single day um  jimmy i just wanted to tell  you i love you i saw your  carol and you're awesome  thank you  before you were saying that  uh you don't beat up on the  porn stars because they're such  easy targets  yeah  but i was just wondering  because i have to turn the  show off very infrequently  but when you're beating up on  stalker patty and lady diet  can't listen because it's so  uncomfortable  well we don't  they're not easy targets  well they are  i mean in all honesty they  are the difference is  um  we have a relationships with 
[02:19:00]  them  and we've gotten to know  them but you're in a way  they are easy targets and  that's why it's like  it's it's harder for me to  be genuinely mean to them  like i've always been pretty  nice to patty we tease them  and get frustrated like with  bobo  but we we know them and when  i say porn stars are easy  targets i don't mean they're  weak  i don't mean that they're  dumb i just mean  that the idea of the male  radio show host  saying shitty things to the  porn chick  is predictable  and fucking corny 
[02:19:30]  and it's like what are we  gonna pretend that they're  not hot  it's like this this chick  sucks dick for a living  good god bless her  what a great girl because i  can jerk off watching her  if they're cunty that's one  thing  but if they're nice  it's it's because like  she's coming into our world  good luck going into her  world and surviving  yeah  any any any morning guy  that's a dick to a fucking  porn chick  good luck  surviving where she does  every day  take your dick out  in front of all those 
[02:20:00]  people  get it hard motherfucker  and stick it into a girl  while a camera crew  and then watch how she  fucking runs circles around  you  as she does that  professionally  and you flounder like a  child  like you know what i mean  like  there's a real  staring at me while you're  giving the speech  but i'm not though  i know you  and honestly i'm just  it's it's just  i have a respect for them  that i think we should all  have because we've all  watched their videos  i mean look you're but  you're right though  thank you very much  carrie i appreciate it  if they're cunts though  some of them can be 
[02:20:30]  absolutely  some of them the  fucking cunty and  diva-ish  like i've been in  i've done shows in vegas  and and and some of you  know some of those girls  have shown up and some of  the penthouse pets and  shit like that  and they sit up front  and they fucking think  they're just better than  and nobody can touch them  get i've kicked them  get the fuck out  yeah  they're fucking cunts  but a lot of porn girls  have a very great  demeanor they actually  if they know  i do suck dick for a  living i take it in the  ass i take dps  but whatever that's what 
[02:21:00]  i like and they're nice  people then you should  have no problem with them  when belladonna  belladonna i don't believe  is uh when she came in  yeah she was great  she's watching her movies  and laughing and having  fun  that's the type of girl  you like  and sometimes they are  snotty and standoffish  like anybody else  if anyone's like that  it's irritating  but i mean as a rule  just when the girl  comes in to start with  the oh is your dad  probably oh fucking  z  z  how fucking corny  do that i'll respect  the guy when he can 
[02:21:30]  when he can survive  if another porn guy  did that to her  i would be back off  and go i respect that  because he understands  her world  and he's man enough  to live in her world  i'm not  i can't do what she does  she can't do what i do  either most porn girls  can't do stand-up or radio  so i respect what they do  um  let's talk to uh  no who said that  let's do that first  and then we'll go to  i got it  this one  yeah  mike and queens  whoever  well i gotta tell sam  oh  mike  sorry charles  yeah right 
[02:22:00]  i'm just talking in your  headphones and stuff  hello  morning good morning  hey  hey jim you've never  hidden this uh  this crazy fetish side  of you  uh  if there's a fetish  out there for the ones  with after birth  then it's never more  meaty than right after  giving birth  would you dive right in  and munch  nah fetish is something  natural  i think it just happens  it's not my thing  i've gotten into feet  more lately  i've been looking at  toes more  and getting sexually  attracted to toes  but no i do not have  no desire for  after birth 
[02:22:30]  on the face  i honestly no dude  i i have no  is that a thing  no but no he's just  being silly  but i mean i don't  find pregnant  and thank you for the  call mike  i don't find uh  anything about pregnancy  to be sexy  um like a lot of guys  like the milk and stuff  and it's not  i respect it but it's  just not a fetish for me  i don't sexualize it  at all  actually breast milk though  is fucking tasty  as shit  yeah i've heard  it's very tasty  it's sweet  it's like uh  it's like cereal milk  um yes i've heard  that it is  let's go to zach 
[02:23:00]  in new jersey  maybe bobby knows  about this  hey guys how are you  hi buddy  hey uh jim  going to see you  at the sands of bethlem  can't wait to see you  fuck bags there  i'm really excited  thank you man  it is on  and honestly it's a  great show  so i appreciate you  coming  awesome  hey uh  i just want to ask  bobby uh  i know when my wife  was in uh labor  uh i don't know how  it was for you  but uh they  they don't bring  the doctor in  until like the  the baby's ready  to come out  and uh my wife  had a nurse in  there with her  and uh all the way 
[02:23:30]  up right right up  until she gave birth  and uh she was  having her push  and having her push  and a stream of  blood came pouring  out of my wife's ear  and uh i freaked  and uh i freaked out  because the nurse  obviously had no  idea what was  going on  and she was just  saying oh let's  let's calm down  let's not get  excited  and i was swearing  at her and  everything  and uh here she uh  from pushing really  hard she actually  burst the uh blood  vessel in her  eardrum  jesus  and she had a  temporary loss  of hearing  uh she was fine  it was actually 
[02:24:00]  funny because the  doctor i caught the  doctor talking to  one of the other  doctors uh telling  one of their buddies  you know how  great that was  he'd never seen  anything like that  so but anyway i  just wanted to ask  you did any weird  shit like that  happen when your  wife was giving  birth anything  and it was so it  was so easy and so  quick the doctor  came in checked  her cervix and  then 20 minutes  later the baby was  out she gave you  it was it was  enough it was i  was shocked how  easy the baby came  out it was you 
[02:24:30]  know but it's it's  fucking different for  everybody but that  if my wife's ear  started bleeding i  would have i probably  would have fainted  i would have  flipped out if i  saw that but now  the doctor the  doctor we didn't  stop pushing until  the doctor said  okay if some  nurse said stop  pushing i probably  would have told her  to go get the  doctor i'm not  fucking yeah i'm  not listening to  some fucking some  chick with uh you  know without a  fucking degree you  know what i mean  but you know yeah  that's crazy dude 
[02:25:00]  but thank thank god  she's all right that  would have flipped me  out she had an  aneurysm while  giving birth that  was my biggest fear  that my wife would  die giving birth to  the kid not only  would i lose the  love of my life  now i have to  fucking take care of  a kid by myself  i'd be that guy  i'd have to move  back with my mom  oh but thank god  that didn't happen  i don't even know  why i'm bringing that  up thank you  buddy  hey mike in new  york has a question  for bobby  hey jim

[02:28:00]  know there's no way there's  no way there's no there was  no way you would get in this  crowd at all a microphone in a  bar on a nobody even knew  we were there terrible yeah  you could tell i was on the  third floor and you could  tell how hard it probably  was but i just i appreciate  you trying yeah it made me  laugh a couple times so all  right good thank you sir  thanks guys um bobby in  colorado has one of these  advice on a relationship well  that's what i'm good at nice  howdy guys hi bobby hey  what are you doing in 
[02:28:30]  colorado are you smoking a  lot of reefers how's jim  actually i'm sitting on a  horse okay moving some cow  i'm sitting next to one  okay are you are you really  on a horse right now yeah  yeah horse on a ranch up in  gremlin colorado yeah but i  listen to you guys listen  jimmy i wish anton was there  and you guys i've been listening  this is like crazy ass shit i've  been listening to you guys since  you came on xbm thank you 
[02:29:00]  buddy and so to be able to talk  to you it's an honor of course  thanks anyway i i was married  for 23 years got within a  horrible divorce went to about  six seven chicks after it ran  them off all me i realized  after the last one that it was  i'm the one that's fucked up  sure yeah what's the comment  that i'm in and so this last  one i realized about six months  after i i fucking pissed her 
[02:29:30]  off and she ran her off but i  was really in love with this  girl but she's with somebody  else okay it's the old country  song how do you get her back  what do i do now she calls me  about once a month and i had  talked to her she's the one that  called me wait how long how long i'm  sorry but how long you were  together for how long well her and  i were together about five months  six months that's how long every one  of my relationships after my  marriage lasted okay five or six  months how long you've been  split about six seven months okay 
[02:30:00]  so you split longer than you  together sometimes were you on to  be honest were you taking her for  granted were you being shitty to  her yeah yeah i wouldn't go to her  house wouldn't talk to her she did  one thing that reminded me of my my  wife you know or anything in that  relationship it's almost like i  even shut down dude i i don't even  know what sorry i apologize one of  the things that you may have is like  i i know that sometimes for me the  chase is very important so sometimes 
[02:30:30]  when you get something and you get a  person you want you may lose interest  because there's no challenge and then  when they leave and you can no longer  have them your interest is peaked  again so that could be a thing in you  but uh if you know what you're doing  wrong and she's still she's with  another guy right now yeah she's she's  with it and she told me this the other  day we talked because i'm with a 22 i'm  just gonna see how long it lasts i  think jimmy i think that she doesn't 
[02:31:00]  trust me obviously so she doesn't know  what to think of me and like do you go  out of your way because i know there's a  fine line between wooing some girl and  stalking her yeah you don't want to do  that dude it's ugly yeah i ain't gonna  help you either and also dude if you're  being a dick after five months what do  you expect her to think um i give it  some time stay friends with her but  start dating other people you'll find  somebody else you're not in love after  fucking five months the big problem is  that she left you and you don't like 
[02:31:30]  it so i would suggest no no jimmy  jimmy i left her oh you left her i i i  everyone that i've dated i've i just i and  and you are absolutely right is it chase  is what's thrilling and then once i get  them so i ask but when when did your  interest in her repeat when she started  dating someone else no because i hadn't  even talked to her i i mean she had well  talked to her once every once every month  or so i didn't even know she was dating  until she just told me that the other  day but it was this is a crazy thing 
[02:32:00]  jim about two weeks before she had called  me the last time and i had deleted her  number from my phone i didn't even know  it and so i kind of just thought well you  know what if it if it's meant to be and i  started thinking about her about i don't  know a month and a half ago or so i  thought man that relationship was pretty  good and you need to then you know what  you're so fucked up over these  relationships you don't know what's true  in your head and what's not but all i  know is this i started thinking about  her and i thought man i really like that 
[02:32:30]  girl there were some really great points  about her and i you know i missed her i  missed being around her and so i get to  she calls she called and then oh me son  of a bitch you fucking called two weeks  later and i hadn't heard from her five  months and a half or so i wanted to know  some goofball question that you could  ask her dad and i think man is that what  that meant to be is she looking for  something here's my here's my suggestion  my friend um and and i appreciate your  call thank you very much for calling in  my suggestion would be this continue to 
[02:33:00]  remain friends with her and then see  where it goes because you only date if  you dated for three years i'd say that's  different but don't pursue and woo her  it's irritating when somebody's being  wooed while they're dating someone else um  you know just remain friends with her  maybe the problem was you aren't good  enough friends first but you know and  just date other people you'll find  somebody else can i say something real  quick of course sometimes when you you  um exactly right bob right exactly  thanks i'm kidding i know when you  remain friends with somebody like that  and you go out and date other people and 
[02:33:30]  they see that you're moving on yeah that  then they that fucks them up then they  realize oh shit i like you and they  kind of you get them a little jealous you  know and they realize what they don't  have even though you fucked it up and  you might be able to repair it that way  and uh i have a quick question i want to  go to ray in las vegas because he's  saying something uh ray hey what's up  jimmy hey ray hey how you doing good  buddy thank you for calling  long time listener hey listen i'm going  through vegas and there's this big  billboard i'm a truck driver there's a 
[02:34:00]  big billboard we do on it what's up  with that what's what for what i don't  i don't know if i believe it  uh no there isn't really there isn't  i was just kidding no i was just kidding  well  who do you drive for  what about the number one guy okay that's  our appearance that didn't make sense  yeah that's their appearance on amy  schumer yes sir uh on phil south  oh phil hey hey phil hey phil he's 
[02:34:30]  from you guys were so creepy on that  show where'd you get your inspiration  uh we actually had to take the  creepiness down in our shirt from real  life  yeah we both didn't have our panties on  yeah we had to change pants a couple  times i went totally bald to match  bobby and uh you know we just knew it  would be funny just to we should call  this the nolan gunth show and uh you  know yeah it was just it was fun and 
[02:35:00]  uh it was i'm glad they showed outtakes  because i i didn't see the outtakes but  we were just laughing at the end  right about i mean we had to pop up  when amy walked over and every time we  were just fucking laughing  yeah that was fun  period crimps  thank you buddy  remember when i had my dead toenail and  amy looked down through the  and she goes bobby what the fuck is  wrong with your toe  oh no  because we have flip-flops on  i do not remember that  um oh let's see uh robert in philly  he's got a nice problem 
[02:35:30]  hmm  yo  robert  hey  hey bob  oh i gotta piss  listen um i'll get right to it  i think a lot of guys can probably  relate to this  you know 10 years in three kids  the whole nine  you know it's like things just change  yeah  so like  i'd say you know  certain amount of time ago  i made some changes in my life  i got back in great  fucking shape  yeah  and you know one thing leads to 
[02:36:00]  another and i'm banging this  24 year old model now  on the side  yeah  okay  and you know  it started  it's great  i guess  it's great  and the reason i called was like  you think you can balance it  and you start talking  and the other day she looks  straight at me and she's like  i get pregnant  i'm keeping the kid  and i guess the main reason for the call was  how does this end without  a debacle on either  on either side  it's a disaster waiting to  and believe you 
[02:36:30]  i'm not saying this morally  you gotta stop fucking the model  you  you're married with kids  you heard it  she's telling you  i will keep the kid  so what will happen is this  you'll knock her up  you'll  you'll probably lose your marriage  and you'll be paying either  child support to your wife and kids  and alimony  and child support to this model  who you may wind up staying with  for a little while  until she turns into an absolute cunt  um 
[02:37:00]  exactly  that's the reason  i'm in a good position now  but  like i already started  the  holy shit  i gotta shut all this down  but it's like  you know  it's just  it's unbelievable  because  even when  you get the greatest side piece  that you ever imagined  you still hit a fucking wall of shit  so i guess there is no  there's no being happy  well how long you been fucking the model  it's  it's four months  here's what you take out of this  okay  she actually 
[02:37:30]  this is how this could have gone  hey  i'm pregnant  and i'm keeping the kid  i know but she spits on my mouth  okay look  i'm sure she's fantastic  i'm trying to make it  i'm being serious  but you're right  i know if this would have happened  i wouldn't be making jokes  i'd be ready to jump off a bridge  yeah but that didn't happen  so you got the best of both worlds  all right  yeah your wife's a mess right now  but you got to fuck a model for a few months  and not knock her up  most times  this story does not end the way you're saying 
[02:38:00]  most times it ends  with  oh my god  she's pregnant  and i want to shove her into an elevator shaft  but you don't have that  so  take this as a shot  across the bow  and go  i got my warning shot  i got lucky  it's almost like  you're drunk driving  and you just slammed on the brakes  and missed a family by two feet  take the warning  because next time  you're not going to get the warning  you got lucky  be happy you got  instead of looking at  you're losing model pussy  say you're losing 
[02:38:30]  21 years  of financial nightmare  which is what would happen to you  okay  yeah i think  i i honestly  i honestly appreciate that  i gotta work  i'm starting a shutdown process now  not easy  but i'm working on it  good luck brother  you're the man  i really appreciate it  thank you  we're gonna take a quick break  bobby went to piss  and all you people on the phone  you can hold or call back  but we'll talk to you for a little while longer  michelle beetle  what happened to michelle  i didn't know she wasn't coming in  uh she's rescheduled  okay  um  i'm unfortunate  i was looking forward to seeing her  fucking great legs 
[02:39:00]  oh yeah  um  all right so i guess we're back in a few minutes  sure  i'm gonna go make a wee  this is the opian anthony show  the opian anthony show presents  primetime sam roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get  reality show

[02:40:30]  oh my god  chris angel  what  yeah it's chris angel  is it chris angel  no  no  no this is uh  chris kpatrick  jesus christ  oh wow  i don't know  why i was in the newspaper  in buff  why i was in the news in buffalo  oh yeah why was bobby in the news  i don't know  what if they were lying  jim was not a billboard in vegas  that's true  it's not the same  do you know the odds of that  he's very good  brian in boston  we have a very interesting problem here  that bobby and i could probably both help you with  oh sal  what's up brian 
[02:41:00]  hey jimmy  uh  i have a really interesting question  um  i suffer from  uh  i think called uh  intergasmic  ejaculation  which  that is  the inability  to  orgasm  or cum  uh  well i thought it said  the inability  to swallow  cum  because bobby and i  both  no i'm kidding  go ahead  we can teach you right now  we do a class at a community college  on wednesdays  so so what's that  what's uh  why can't you  you can't 
[02:41:30]  so you orgasm  but no jizz shoots out  no no no  i don't even orgasm  it's um  it's a neurology  um  issue  okay  my body has the inability  to reach orgasms  so i can't cum  basically  and i've been diagnosed  with that  since i was like 13  okay  um  so here's the thing  i'm married  my wife wants kids  i don't want kids  uh  in uh  but here's the big dilemma  is  when i was at a massage college 
[02:42:00]  they jerked me off  and i had an orgasm  and it's happening twice now  now let me ask you  was it your first orgasm  or no  it was my second orgasm  ever  and  when was your first one  and how did it happen  uh  let's see  your first one  was again  at a  uh  massage parlor  you know  you haven't even been able  to achieve them jerking off  huh  no  so why don't you  this all you have to do  is get the old asian lady  to jerk you off  into your wife's vagina 
[02:42:30]  yeah  yeah exactly  have your wife laying on the floor  and then just jizz off  and hope it lands in there  yeah  just pat it in  like you're making a sandcastle  i know  i tried everything  with my wife  i said  i said  listen  you gotta use baby oil  whatever  i don't care  if i'm like  robber  just keep  you know  fucking jerk me off  until i come  let me ask  i'm sorry to interrupt you  let me ask you a question  when the massage lady  jerked you off  did you have an erection  through the whole thing  i did  and then  it was  it was so long 
[02:43:00]  that i thought  i lost it  and then she still kept at it  and she  and i blew my lid  see  let me ask you now  uh  what  do you have a good body  are you in good shape  uh  average  i'm wondering  if you have  because what i  what happens to me sometimes  and i ask that  because of body image issues  it's  it might be with you  i'm sure  i'm not gonna fuck  with a medical diagnosis  but it might be a mental thing  where  you don't know how to relax  unless  because someone's jerking you off  for money  we can relax there 
[02:43:30]  with prostitutes  i've been able to relax  because the self-esteem i have  that's bad about my body  my low image  is free  i'm freed from that  in those moments  and i can just relax  and be comfortable  and allow someone to pleasure me  without focusing on  i'm taking too long  i'm ugly  i have tits  i'm not attractive  all the things that block  remember the other day  on the my show  i said that the fucking  but you know  the mental  the self-esteem  is like a fucking 
[02:44:00]  shoe heel on your dick  if  and also  can i say something too  that also  with your chick  because you love them  that also fucks you up too  because you care about them  that intimacy  or that level of  of  of  not madonna whore  but  oh you're right  in that way  that you shut down  because it's like  your friend too  she's your fucking  soulmate  she's your partner  there's something dirty  and a little fucked up  and you don't care 
[02:44:30]  and you can be  that perverted side  or you can let that go  with some lady  you're paying  but with your wife  you care  you don't give a fuck  there's a risk  right with your wife  of her being displeased  of her disapproving  yeah  and she's also  some of that sex  that sexiness  gets cut off  because you  you desensitize yourself  to your chick  because you see her  in the shower  you see her taking a piss  you see her tits out  all the time  she sees you  and you kind of  you become like  pals  you know what i mean  and you forget that 
[02:45:00]  you know when you  first met her  you never saw her tits  and your dick got hard  and you got all excited  about it  sometimes you have to  go backwards  to go forward  but he didn't even  come with her then  you didn't come with  your wife at the beginning  absolutely not  he's had two orgasms  in his life  both times getting  jerked off  that's why i think  it's a mental thing  combined with the  physical problem maybe  but the mental thing  i think is important  because if you were  able to come on  a massage table  the difference is  yeah she gives  a good hand job  but you were able  to free yourself  from whatever it is 
[02:45:30]  that's blocking you  hey Tim  i have another  good question  yes  um  now  you've taken  Vyagra  multiple times  right  yes  Cialis  yes  okay  um  my doctor gave me  Vyagra  he gave me a  50 milligram  tablet  it gets me hard  but i lose it  a little bit  um  should i like  bump it up  to 100  or  50 milligram  it sounds like  you have erection  did you a big dick  or small dick  i haven't  i think 
[02:46:00]  okay so you're  not self-conscious  about your dick  that's not average  that's above average  but no no  i mean again  it sounds to me  like one of your  problems is you  have erection  problems  and the erection  problems can fuck  with your head  more than anything  dude  and a lot of  times again  that's caused  by body image  or dick size  issues or  or whatever  um  you uh  you may have  uh  just erection  problems that are  fucking with your  head  did you ever  try to fuck  a girl when  you were young  and lose your  rod  uh  it all goes  back um 
[02:46:30]  i'm kind of  like uh  we're going  through therapy  i'm going  through therapy  right now  because when  i was a kid  uh  i had like  uh  an issue  with another  girl  we were both  like  fourth grade  i think  and we both  touched each  other  and i'm  fucked up  because of it  i guess  why  why are you  fucked up  did you  get yelled  at or were  you shamed  for it  we got  we both  got in trouble  and then i  actually had  to move  to a different  school  so okay  so you have  this experience  which is pretty  normal 
[02:47:00]  and and something  gets inside of  your head  where this is  shameful and  absolutely damaging  and wrong  so maybe that's  a big part of it  but if it's a  mental problem  like or a  mental issue  it can be  fixed dude  whatever you're  going through  you'll come to  know that it's  not how old  are you  i'm 31  so yeah  you'll come to  realize that it's  not the truth  whatever that thing  is it's telling  yours true  is not true  so just keep  relaxing keep  going to therapy  and you should  be very grateful  you were able  to blow that  load and you  probably will be  able to with  your wife sooner 
[02:47:30]  or later but  you just got to  make it okay in  your own head  you gotta relax  yes you gotta  relax  what's that buddy  i have yeah but  i think 50  milligrams is strong  enough again go  to a doctor and  see do you have  a physical problem  is there a blood  flow issue i  would say talk to  the doctor first but  if your body can  take it 50  milligrams is  pretty strong  dude 100  milligrams is  stronger and  uh but your  dick should be  staying hard on  50 milligrams so  if it's not it's  either a physical  issue uh but or 
[02:48:00]  chances are i've  lost erections on  100 milligrams it's  mental i it sounds  mental because if  if an asian lady in  a massage place  you can make you  cum and your  wife can't there's  something there's  something there buddy  especially since you  had the shaming  issue in your kid  get your wife some  flip-flops and let  her fingernails grow  yeah make her breath  really bad thank you  buddy good luck  buddy oh let's see  uh uh what's the  next one uh oh  let's try that one  and then we have  another guy for  bobby yes  oh justin columbus 
[02:48:30]  because he was i  was justin columbus  but then i left  fuck i should have  ended the show on  that chipper hello  bobby hey bobby  hey buddy  hey i've been waiting  to talk to you for  a long time  of course you have  yeah that their  common interests uh  probably from the  hottest train you'll  ever see but uh the  reason i'm actually  calling is because i'm  completely incapable of  being monogamous even  though i genuinely want  to be yes i have  trouble with uh keeping  my dick in my pants  and not straying away 
[02:49:00]  how old are you  i'm 32 my friend but  i tell the ladies i'm  28 years old so  okay what are you from  hollywood  exactly what do you  why sorry go ahead  why do you tell why  do you lie to girls  about your age  uh well i'm trying to  fuck 23 year olds  fair enough you won me  over  touche  now what now what was  what was your issue  about you buddy you  called about something  about uh  well so um there was  a guy who got caught  earlier who um had a 
[02:49:30]  little side project  right  uh was uh making  comments about wanting  to be pregnant um by  this the chick was  going to keep the  baby out  and i'm always up  front anytime i engage  in any kind of uh  extramural relationship  and then i tell them  that it's something  temporary and that i  have a family that i  wouldn't leave uh them  for um this past  january i met a 23 year old  who um is uh basically a  nut job and a couple 
[02:50:00]  weeks into it she said  she wanted to be  pregnant by me and  she leaves my family and  i ended up not cutting it  off soon enough and what  basically happened was i  ended up pissing her off  one day and uh she called  my wife up at home and  told her that she and i  had been messing around  um what a cunt  i had been messing  around with other  women but um the  fortunate part of that  is that she didn't admit  to messing around with  me um so she blamed it  on the other girls i  don't know what the hell  happened there she was 
[02:50:30]  just being a coward or  um i guess somebody was  looking out after me but  i've dodged a lot of  large bullets and i  continue to be a depraved  demented uh sexual  deviant  well again like the  guy who i talked to  before he got the shot  across the fucking bow  of the bridge sometimes  you have to take the  lucky warning and run  with it and not push  your luck because a lot  of times you have to  realize something bad is  going to happen 
[02:51:00]  numerically it's bound  to if you've gotten  lucky you had a crazy  cunt call your wife and  you skated and then  there's not a part of  you that goes oh my  fucking god am i lucky  that's a sex addiction  that's what sex addiction  is it's people don't  don't believe in sex  addiction well if you  don't believe in sex  addiction you're dumb  you know what you're  talking about because  that's the insanity of  it you have a marriage  you obviously love your  wife or you wouldn't be  married to her you  you're married you're 
[02:51:30]  risking well maybe you  don't love her do you  love her she's a cunt on  wheels i love her but  she has a really bad  temper issue which is what  led me to straying um  about five or six years  or so ago which kind of  just snowballed since then  and i've been uh blessed  with having been given this  gift of having the perfect  cock according to many  women i know you're a  little bit curious you  probably wound it up your  ass now jimmy but  oh that's nice language  that's nice language for  the radio audience  here's the thing your 
[02:52:00]  wife's a cunt but would  you have cheated on her  either way  um i don't i had never  cheated on any other girl  before her well you're  saying you have a problem  with monogamy so you don't  have a problem with monogamy  you're just cheating on  your wife  but i don't want to be with  anybody else i just wish you  weren't such a cunt on  wheels  well is right why did you  marry her if she's a cunt  oh we're not married we're  just uh indefinitely  engaged  oh so you're not you're not  married okay  all right it's just a  fiance there's a big  difference there there's a  big legal issue difference 
[02:52:30]  there um so what is your  question you can't stop  you you're probably a sex  addict if you're continually  cheating and you're making  bad decisions um yeah but  he's also saying that he he's  got a great cock i mean he's  sitting there so he's you  fucking yeah but you're  fucking broads because you're  like fucking you're a young  guy you like banging young  girls you you you got you  even say that you have a  girls tell you you have this  awesome cock which i've never  heard in my life and uh you 
[02:53:00]  like what you're doing it's  not that your girl's a cunt  it's that you know she's a  cunt i'm sure she's probably  a cunt which is the excuse  that you're giving yourself  but you're banging on the  broads because you like the  fucking hunt you like showing  girls your cock you like  hearing girls go you have a  nice cock  yep you like that shit that's  coming out of you  no no no no it isn't it isn't  that it isn't egotistical thing  it's more it's just yeah it's  it's not ego it's self-esteem  it's it's i'm not saying  that you're a fucking  narcissistic asshole i'm 
[02:53:30]  saying that it feels good  when fucking chicks like you  and tell you that you're  sexy and tell you have a  nice cock and that you're  fucking good and you don't  get that from your chick  your chick isn't  complimenting you or telling  you that you're fucking good  that she loves your cock and  she loves sucking your dick  but these that's what you  like look as a man okay you  have to get what you like  sexually you can't sacrifice  because you like this girl 
[02:54:00]  because a lot of  relationships are habits you  become a habit you're just  together because you don't  know how to get out of it  it's too much of a struggle to  get the fuck out of it so you  just stay in it and you go and  you cheat and you go get what  you want sexually from other  people what you should do for  yourself and for your chick that  you care about even though she's  a cunt end it get the fuck out  you're not married there's no  kids there's no house end it 
[02:54:30]  what the kids in a house ah  fuck them or just figure out  what's more sometimes you gotta  figure out what's more important  talk to your wife you know i mean  look that that's that's the  hardest way to go the hardest  way you can go is is go to  therapy and try to deal with  your sex addiction or problems and  talk to your wife about what  you're lacking what she's not  giving you because you're going  to hear what you're not giving  her i have tried to go to  therapy about my sexual 
[02:55:00]  addiction and the the counselor  ended up being a complete creep  asking very explicit details  about my encounters but that's  just another excuse i mean the  bottom line is i'm a selfish  asshole who just likes to put a  dick in hot girls and shoot loads  in them well if you want to shoot  loads in them you're playing a very  risky game and eventually you're  going to knock your girl up so  either be ready for that and go i'm  going to have to deal with my at my  cunt and kids at house or stop  doing it can i say something too is  that you sometimes guys when we do 
[02:55:30]  this we're doing all this stuff  because getting out of the  situation we're in is too much of a  hassle the honesty that it takes but  getting caught and having everything  crumble down having the walls fall  down around us because we got caught  being a fucking creep is easier yeah  and the day that happens the day you  get caught cheating on somebody you  give a fuck about is the day that  the the clouds will clear and the sun  shines through because now you don't 
[02:56:00]  have to fucking lie it's out on the  table there's something fucking uh  serene about that because you don't  have to live in this fucking shadow  world anymore i'm a piece of shit you  caught me now where do we go from  here now you can either choose to do  that yourself and work towards it or  wait for the day that it all falls  down but it's going to happen it's  going to happen thank you buddy for  the call okay i appreciate it good  luck to you my friend i got a question  from sammy the girl who called us  samantha hmm she twittered

[02:58:00]  six minutes and just do them  continuously for five or six minutes  and it works everything huh  yes absolutely your lungs will be  burning  uh you your back your shoulders will  be a little sore your arms will be  tight  and your thighs are going to blow up  like tree trunks  okay thank you buddy no i've never  done them  a couple of the girls again the  trainers have uh they had me do  squats and the one they always  have these combination exercises  now you're going to push in and  pull and then squat and like  ah  but uh yes i do that but i don't do  anything as good as the hindu

[02:59:30]  no i can't fucking stand the  bitch  did you want to fuck your  your stepdaughter when you're  with her  um  not really i mean you know  it's kind of the the  protective father type thing  sure  and but then you know i mean  she's grown up i mean she's  fucking phenomenal  how long did you live with her  as a daughter for  three years  oh it wasn't like since  from what ages  uh what 14 to 17  oh god  yeah that's young but i mean 
[03:00:00]  it's not like you raised her  as your daughter  no but that's young  no no but meaning it's not  like you were there when she  was a baby up till  adulthood  what was the age again  14 to 17  so when you came in  she 14 is way too young  and 15 is way too young  but a girl who's 16 or 17  you look at  and you'll go like  oh she's kind of fucking cute  like you know  oh i was a  i was a fucking kid  i used to have her like  oh yeah you know what  let's go ahead  for a sleepover  i mean i was i was  fucking wrong as shit  but you know  you never did anything 
[03:00:30]  did you you never did  anything with the  you never jerked off to it  no and they see that's  the thing she  one of the uh  the text messages  was that um  her mom was a big fat  pig that was  one of the biggest problems  but  the um  she sent me a message  that said that  uh  one particular time  i did i remember  because her mom was like  loud as shit  i was fucking the shit  out of her mom  and she was in the  her bedroom was next  and she was in the  her bed  masturbating to the 
[03:01:00]  sounds of us having sex  well honestly  so what is your advice  what hotel should you get  oh jesus  are you calling me  for hotel rates  i mean  the thing is man  is that  it's like  i mean  i know there's no  you know  it's like a moral thing  i guess  i mean  should i bang the fuck  i mean i'd love to  but  it depends  i think it depends  on how you look at her  it depends  here's the thing  it depends on how  you see her  sentence should  fucking answer your  question  do you see her as  i was your stepdad  a daughter 
[03:01:30]  stepdad is a legal term  it doesn't mean anything  where do you see  do you see each other  in a parental daughter way  or  do you honestly  when you look at her  see her  as the hot daughter  of the woman  you were married to  there's a big difference  in the perception  because there's no  blood relation  and uh  it's like a 90%  10%  there's i mean  the 90% is  holy fuck  here's a 20 year old  with massive  beautiful titties  that wants to  fuck the shit  out of me  and then 10%  is well i remember 
[03:02:00]  when this chick  like you know  yeah  you know what i mean  i don't know  did you do any  father daughter  things together  yeah that's  and i mean  she actually  she was about  16 years old  that was the thing  you know  her mom was a whore  and had like  all kinds of guys  in and out  before i was there  and like one night  you know  i'm like  hey  come on  give me a hug  before you go to bed  and she like  gives me a nice big hug  and goes i love you  and that's just like  yeah i mean  when you're  when you're in that position  it's just like  it broke my heart  and it was just  all the shit that happened 
[03:02:30]  after i left  i mean  i'm gonna be a party pooper  ready  you're gonna fucking  give her sexual issues  she has sexual  she has sexual issues  that's why she wants  to fuck you  she has daddy issues  that's why she's  fucking a guy  that cared about her  or that gave a shit  about her  that she actually  feels for  you're that guy  you're being friendly  with her  she probably always  wanted to fuck you  so if you fuck her  which i'm not saying  you should or you shouldn't  whatever  i've done creepy shit  in my life too  but i've done shit 
[03:03:00]  with your stepfather  not with my stepfather  but i've had  you know  i've had  i've had girls  with sexual issues  and i've taken advantage  of those fucking things  you know  so  i've only had girls  with sexual issues  yeah but i mean  you know  you have to know  that you're  you're doing something  that isn't healthy  for her  yeah  it might not be bad  for you  because you just  but it's definitely  she's not  she doesn't want  to fuck you  because she's  in a good mental state  and she may  you know what dude  maybe she was  if the mothers 
[03:03:30]  always had guys  coming in and out  you never know  what one of them  did to her  when she was young  right right  so you know what  bobby's right  you might want  to avoid that  even though  it's a great story  you have a father  daughter thing  so just jerk off  thinking about it dude  it's easy to say  do it  but  and it's hard  to say don't  but you don't  want to fuck her up  that ain't nice  here's what i would do  i would sit her down  on your lap  yeah  and have a nice talk  with her  or maybe this  maybe don't fuck her  maybe just have her  suck your dick  yeah  that would be my suggestion  fuck her face

[03:04:30]  oh he's doing it  just like he does  in the wild  oh shit  yes sir  go ahead  joe  hi joe  i was calling you  bob kelly in new york  i'm kidding  joe  what's up joe  hey i'm here  hey buddy  what's up  what's up baby girl  i'm married  i got two kids 
[03:05:00]  yeah  in my late 30s  love women  yeah  but i  i meet up with guys  at night sometimes  and fuck  and i gotta figure out  how to stop it  well let's ask a couple  of questions  um  i'll tell them how  from experience  oh do you  do you wear condoms  with these people  absolutely  all right that's smart  um  are you bisexual  or do you think  you're gay  bisexual  i love pussy  okay  does your wife  know you're bisexual  fuck no  um 
[03:05:30]  are you ashamed  is there any way  you could tell her  oh fuck no  no i i got  two little kids  no way  no no but i'm saying  would you okay  i'm not saying  with the kids  but i mean  you don't tell them  but i mean  would she accept it  i i  it would be  huge problems  well you know  what you gotta do  you gotta either  just accept  who you are  in this fucking  crazy stupid life  you're gonna have to lead  cause you're gonna try 
[03:06:00]  you're gonna stop it  it's like being a serial killer  is what you're doing  you're a fucking serial killer  yeah  you're living this life  over here  and then you're slipping away  to route 17  right  and instead of killing people  you're just treating their cocks  like pan flutes  yeah essentially  where are you acting  are you doing things in public  no  okay  no no  i'm actually  i'm very careful about it  i'm not  i mean it's fucking crazy  but i'm not  uh  i'm very discreet  you know 
[03:06:30]  i i keep it hidden  fairly well  do you want  do you really want to stop it  or does  do you like being with men  well  oh  not you jim  no i i don't  i  i don't want to stop it  but  but i don't  but i can't do both  you don't want to lose  you don't want to lose  your life with your family  right  because of  your sexual  yeah  the other  sexual things you do  so why  you gotta go  you gotta go talk to somebody man  you gotta go talk to a  a counselor or somebody 
[03:07:00]  you need to be able to  be honest about this  uh  with a hundred percent  with somebody  uh  because you can't be honest  with your wife  you  you can't be  it's not neutral  you need to go talk to somebody  who's neutral  and you can be honest  with a hundred percent  about these feelings  and work through them  because you might not  want to do this stuff  with men  it might be  yes he does  well it might be just  your sexual deviantness  coming out  you know  i mean  we all do  fucked up shit  that we don't want to do 
[03:07:30]  i jerk off to weird shit  that i don't want to jerk off to  i'm not going to tell my wife that  but i go to therapy  and i talk to him  and i explain  well i did this  and i don't know why i like that  i really don't want to do it  but your wife probably figures it out  when she opens it up  and the home page  is the fucking  is the boy scout's fucking website  she types in sheridan hotel  and just  she mail sites  pop up on the fucking google search  don't do any transmission searches  exactly  yeah  oh you know what dude  fucking  go  get fucked  and just be careful 
[03:08:00]  yeah  that's a tough one dude  because  not that i have a moral thing with marriage  i don't give a fuck about people being married  but i just  you know  i don't want to say the wrong thing  and say  yeah it's cool to do while you're married  i mean  that's a big one though  you get caught  banging another chick  you can repair that  there's a way out of that somehow  you get caught fucking a dude  yeah  not only are you gonna be fuck  that's a tough one to come back from  with the woman  maybe you should just hint it a little bit  like if you're watching porn or something  and people are having sex  maybe you go  oh that pekka looks pretty fucking delicious  hey wait 
[03:08:30]  now  could you tell her  like why wouldn't she accept  that you fantasize about this stuff  not that you do it  but why couldn't you ease her into the fact  that you fantasize about this stuff  i've been together almost 15 years  you know it's uh  i've only acted out on it  maybe the past six  six years  yeah  well  what would happen if you told her  do you think  uh  life as i know it is over  and i like my life 
[03:09:00]  wait  my good life  i like  if you told her that you  but you have fantasies like this  she'd divorce you  yeah  fuck yeah dude  i guess so  fuck yeah dude  i mean look  if i told my wife  that i fucking like banging dudes  she'd she'd leave  not because she  hates gays  or  she  it just fucks them up  in their brain  that  you don't want to fuck them  yeah  well do you  let me ask you  do you have resentment  towards your wife  because you can't tell her  no no 
[03:09:30]  she's a good woman  okay  well then i would just say  go to like  do you still bang your wife  and do you do it  does she have to be on her belly  yeah  exactly  do you ask your wife  not to shave her legs  is your mouth open  while you fuck your wife  yeah  well then what you gotta do  is just keep fucking your wife  and just close your eyes  yeah  and say look  could you pound a dildo  maybe ask your wife  to fuck you with a strap on  would she do that  no  it's the same as before  but not to tell her  that it's just a weird  this is what you do  this is what you do  you suck on a banana  while you're fucking  your wife doggy style 
[03:10:00]  every time  yeah  i would say  go to  do you tell  no  yeah  well if she fucking  catches you in the mirror  yeah  go to therapy  my friend  and talk about  go to therapy  if you can't tell her  go to therapy  because you might have to  come out the other side  and you might have to  lose this relationship  or you might deal  with the demons  that are making you  want to go fuck dudes  yeah  it's sex  it's not who you are dude  it's just sex  alright  it's what you want to do  and why  you gotta find out  why you want to do it  i don't know why but 
[03:10:30]  don't worry about it dude  you're not a fucking weirdo  who gives a shit  you like banging dudes  and you matter  well you should  you fucking homo  no i'm joking  hey listen  thank you for calling us  godless sinner  we appreciate it  hey bud  what are you doing this weekend  yeah  thanks buddy  we got time for one more call  let's take one more  thank you for the call  you spelled Aaron  with two A's  you dumb piece of shit  that's what you spell it with  hey  how's it going guys 
[03:11:00]  no but he spelled it  A-R-O-N-A  Arana  hey what's up Aaron  hey what's up  so  my  my older son  got his girl pregnant  right  and  he didn't really want to have a kid  in the first place  but they just found out  like  you know  they did the ultrasound  and the baby's like  intestines are growing  on the outside of the stomach  and  they did like  an ultrasound  and they saw like  a mass on the back  of its neck  and 
[03:11:30]  you know  they did  they did some blood testing  to see if there's some  chromosomal issues  and there's definitely  going to be some  chromosomal issues  now this chick's  within her first  you know  trimester  and  she's already  like attached to it  like I can't  wait to find out  what the sex is  I can't  and I'm just like  I don't know how to  approach them  to tell them like  look  wait  does your son  want to have it  I don't think so  but she wants to  have a baby  I understand 
[03:12:00]  that people are  against abortion  and that's a religious  issue  and whatever  moral  however  but if the  intestines are  growing on the  outside  and there's a  mass on the neck  and the kid  might be retarded  again  purists may say  one thing  but I think  it's very selfish  to have the baby  because you're  dooming this kid  to a life of  surgeries and pain  and maybe other  parents will call up  and go no  you're wrong  but that's my  opinion  if I was the son  try to say  look  get rid of it  and we can  have another baby  but that's why 
[03:12:30]  they have the test  like when we were  having our baby  that's why  you do the test  that's why  so you have options  so you can  terminate  you know  the pregnancy  because  you know  I mean  do you really  want to put that  on these young  kids  and the fucking  baby  that's some  crazy  they're young  and it's crazy  for the kid  I mean  if you gave me  the option  look  you could have  your intestines  on the outside  and live that  crazy life  where you're gonna  have to be disabled 
[03:13:00]  and fucked up  your whole  I would say  fuck it  no way  I'm out  so  shitty existence  I guess  my question  is  how do I  approach them  like  they haven't  asked me my  opinion  I'm the type  of guy  you know  if you're not  going to ask  me my opinion  I'm not going  to give it to you  I'll be here  for you  and I'll support  you  but if you're  going to ask  my opinion  I'm going  to be brutally  honest  they haven't  asked me  for my opinion  yet  so it's like  that's exactly  how you do it  you phrase it  that way  look it  if you want  my opinion  I'm going  to be brutally  honest with you  right now 
[03:13:30]  if you don't  I'm going to  shut the fuck up  and just support  you guys  that's exactly  how you do it  could you talk  to your son  alone  and ask him  how he feels  about it  and then gently  give the opinion  without forcing it  because he may not  and say look  you got to do it  with the girl  though  it's her body  no no no  but the son  might want to  talk to the girl  like just ask  the son  how he feels  if you do it  together  well you know  is it too late  to buy him  like a morning  after pill  and have him  crush it up  and put it 
[03:14:00]  in her eggs  Jesus Christ  yeah I don't know  I think you put it  in a drink  you don't fucking  sprinkle it in eggs  exactly  why are these  eggs red  there's a pill  in my eggs  my suggestion  would be just  if you talk  to the son  or both of them  whatever your  relationship is  and just say to them  you do know  that there's going  to be a tremendous  amount of surgeries  and this is going  to be really  really  yes  we have someone  on the phone  who says he's born  with his intestines  on the outside  oh okay  let's talk 
[03:14:30]  put them both on  yeah  Mike in South Carolina  no I'm not  in South Carolina  I tell the fucking  intern to get it right  I'm in Sacramento  oh okay  wow  sorry  Jesus Christ  I was born  with a condition  called gastroschesis  it's where the stomach  doesn't fully develop  at first  and your intestines  and liver  and guts  are basically  born exposed  oh wow  so okay  and so what happened  what did they do  how did they fix you  I was born in 73  with it  at the time 
[03:15:00]  from the research  I've done  from what doctors  told me  it's only been  a handful  of people  at that time  without being  mentally retarded  I myself  am somewhat retarded  just because of  issues from childhood  but they basically  do a bunch  of skin grafts  I spent the first  nine months  of my life  in the hospital  but it is fixable  okay  but let me ask  you a question  has it  I mean  did it fuck up  your life any  do you  not that you're  you're alive  you sound  you sound great  you sound like  you're doing fine  but was it fucked up  the first nine years 
[03:15:30]  of your life  no nine months  nine months  okay  so you didn't even know  no I didn't even know  I don't have no memory of it  but you don't tell me  about it dude  no it's  like I said  childhood issues  Kelly  okay  so  but uh  the only issues  I've had as an adult  with it was  from scar tissue  growing  because it happened  to so young  the scar tissue  grew over my life  and I ended up  getting uh  scar tissue  wrapping around  my small intestines  which uh  kinked them off 
[03:16:00]  and gave me  bowel obstructions  until they went back in  and had to remove  a small section  of my uh  small intestine  so what is your  suggestion to this guy  to tell his son  I can't speak to the  to the growth  on the back of the neck  maybe it's got a  primordial twin  or something like that  but  I mean  the only issue  I had from  being born like that  was giganticism  in which I had  you know  man-sized tongue  at birth  on my baby pictures  I have a tongue  stick on my mouth  but other than that  the kids can grow  up to be healthy  and my best advice  to them

[03:22:30]  he was going to be  doing this  for a while  we're running promos  since when  today  no they've been running  for a couple days  today was the first  day I heard the promo  yeah me too  I heard him the other  day  no I didn't  I didn't hear him  during the live show  yeah I heard promos  today for it  but not before today  why hasn't he been  promoting this thing  because it's Roland  he's terrible at this  I told him  I said get the  Instagram  start getting the  thing going  get the  Roland's food court  dot com going  he has done  nothing of which  you want to hear 
[03:23:00]  the promo  or no  no we heard it  I mean it's a promo  we'll hear it when  the promos play  516  you're on after  Opie and Anthony  live  you like that one  Troy  yeah  210  rolling rolling  rolling rolling  food court  this Saturday  5 to 7  that was lady  trucker  661  we had a hot  street going 
[03:23:30]  nah  can't keep going  can't keep going  so what's he got  planned for  I don't know  where he is  well why wouldn't  he  he's not picking up  the phone either  he might  well maybe I  shouldn't have  mentioned it yet  hopefully he comes  in and promotes it  are you going to  be here for it  god damn right  I will be  but you have no  idea what's going  on are you the  producer for  Roland's food court  this weekend  I am  but you don't  have any idea  what's happening  you know he knows  all these like  food people  it's all fucking  gibberish to me  like all these  people I don't know 
[03:24:00]  who the hell they are  right  but they're definitely  going to be people  here  it's supposed to be  important the  cuban's going to be  here cuban's the man  he's doing two hours  that's what he says  last time he was  supposed to do one  hour if you remember  last time this  happened we booked a  block and it was  Roland's food court  along with bageling  with the sex  we had to convince  the bagel or the  sex I guess it would  be to do the bageling  with the sex show  he didn't want to do  it he's like no I  don't want to do this  I don't want to do  this so we set up a  block and we had 
[03:24:30]  both those shows of  course the sex is  you Iraq is that  right yeah that's  right  so Eric came in to  do his show finally  he said I'm not going  to do it we said you  have to do it just do  it don't be a spoil  sport just come in he  came in he brought  like Pat Duffy the old  intern with him he  thought it was going to  be like a nice big show  and he gets here  Opie for whatever  reason showed up to  Roland's food court  and said this is going  so well it's got to go  two hours and sex bagel 
[03:25:00]  got the bump yeah  however that's a whole  different scenario than  Roland walking in with  the confidence of saying  no no I do two hours  now yeah you think he  can pull it off we'll  see we'll see I  luckily the cute he  has he has a lot of  like he's a lot of  people on his side that  could help carry the  way he invited Bob  Kelly out so Bob might  come out so yeah he  Roland I told Roland to  just stack the fucking  deck you know what I  mean because that way  you just I mean last  time it was kind of  this uh synergetic thing 
[03:25:30]  where everything came  together yeah it's like  the first hour will  probably go smooth and  then the second hour  maybe even better or  it may be a train wreck  which could be better I  mean you know there  are people who are  sitting there listening  going oh my god I  can't believe Roland's  pulling off this food  show uh and then  there are a lot of  other people going I  really want to hear the  train wreck I want to  hear the whole show  collapse I want to watch  the world burn Troy  and second hour  everybody's drunk  right because I think  he has a bartender  again well he should 
[03:26:00]  I know he lost his  last bartender to  entertainment weekly  radio yeah we can't  find him I'm texting  him I'm calling all  his numbers I call his  office he's nowhere to  be found he doesn't  carry his phone on him  for some reason well  he's just a talent  booker why would you  need a phone it's not  like celebrities are  going to be no but he  takes if like if he's  in the bathroom taking a  shit he always has his  phone with him he would  at least write you back  where are the interns  um that's a good  question one was on  the phone and then  just disappeared you  we have three in you  we have two today two

[03:30:30]  I've been climbing a  ladder ever since you  first heard me appear  on these radio waves  now you say when you  gonna get on TV  well apparently you  didn't check your  television set Monday  because I was on TV  on Monday on a little  show called the  crossover Michelle  Beatle show a sports  show people say Sam  you don't know sports  what are you doing on  that show what was I  doing I was dominating  on that show okay  you didn't realize that  what I said was a  all right your phone's 
[03:31:00]  breaking up Rick you  can tell me about what  how about here's your  next move head over to  the AT&T store and pick  up a little something new  for yourself because you  sound like an anus on the  radio yeah you know you  can't be calling up to  radio shows and asking  somebody what their next  move is but like it's  no whole time you sound  like a jerk off sound  like a real high class a  level judge a jerk off  turd turd that's right  now what's my next move  we'll see what it is I  mean I can't sit there  and be like well here's  what what's going to 
[03:31:30]  happen to me right I  have to get myself out  there and wait and see  I have to I have to I  have to I'm I'm making  myself as visible as a  human being can make  himself industry nobody  knows what tomorrow  exactly nobody knows  nobody knows nobody  knows what the industry  even is anymore tomorrow  some guy come up into  you hey Sam shit I need  you for this right  all right people up a  month ago would I sit  here and tell you yeah  I'm gonna start making  appearances on a sports  show on the NBC sports  network if I told you 
[03:32:00]  that Troy you would have  said what you don't  know anything about  sports yeah so what the  fuck are you talking  about that's a stupid  prediction yeah but that  would have been true I  would I don't know that I  wouldn't have made that  prediction but that's the  way it happened okay and  you guys got to realize  something you can't sit  here and and and and  say map it out for me  Sam what step you're here  at step one what's step  two you'll know step two  when I get there okay  you'll know step two when  I get there you ain't  sleeping that's what it 
[03:32:30]  is you're just hustling  you're grinding does it  seem like I'm sleeping no  no you're making moves  right but but don't like  uh come at me with buzz  words you know yeah you  don't need that shit no  sit on the couch buddy  Roland yes food court yes  tomorrow tomorrow you're  committing to two hours yeah  you sure about this yeah  I'm sure the Cuban has a  couple of people he's  bringing down who's coming  uh a big wig in the food  network and uh he's 
[03:33:00]  bringing two of his  friends that are uh  celebrity chefs they  better be entertaining I  think they are is this  lineup going to be as good  as your last lineup yeah  they're just different  fields though what fields  what can we expect give me  the synopsis you know  everybody's saying Sam  Roberts what's the next  step for you more  importantly the next step  for Roland is tomorrow  night 5 p.m. right 5 p.m.  5 p.m. Eastern time here  on the Opie and Anthony  channel sell it to me  Roland why am I tuning  into the food court well we  have one of the top foodie 
[03:33:30]  writers Jay Orseski he  basically breaks down  everything like the the  cronut craze how that's  bullshit and everything  really he's gonna be  talking about cronuts being  bullshit well because like  that's risky well that's  controversial for a food  show but he wrote like a  lot of articles before like  how New York foodies are  like all blinded by the  PR machine that's behind  each restaurant so like  the top 10 restaurants a  few years ago that every  foodie say you have to go  to half of them already  closed down right so he's 
[03:34:00]  he's exposing the foodie  world like you guys really  don't know what you're  talking about so this guy  pardon my pun pardon it is  coming on the food show  Roland's food court yeah to  say let's talk about the  steak and leave the sizzle  outside that right that's  right what a show this is  gonna be rolling yeah that's  just one of them and then  uh burger the guy from  travel network who travels  around the United States to  find the best burger he's  everywhere he's gonna be on  the show he's gonna stop by  now I was telling Troy last 
[03:34:30]  time you did a food show was  a couple months ago yeah and  you were scheduled for an  hour yeah the show was going  so well that oh we pushed it  to two mm-hmm do you are you  approaching this one  differently now because it's  not like you're not  scheduling for an hour I  spread everybody apart so  at least like each of the  people will be like 20  minutes solo and then they'll  each join each other so it'll  be like do you think he'll be  able to schedule a show like  this Troy schedule a good  show yeah do you think he'll be  able to say well no we're  gonna start the guests here and 
[03:35:00]  here and here I'm gonna place  this and that this is what's on  tap for that he's done it he  did it last time well last time  I think it was more like I got  all these people in the room I'm  just gonna incite this  conversation and get it going  yeah but he spaced it out you  think so he said yeah we're  gonna do this at this time  rolling actually has surprised  me the past two shows that  we've done we actually like he  comes in prepared ready to go  he's sweating like a  motherfucker oh god is he the  whole two 120 minutes of  sweating I mean it's just sweat  is pouring off of him but he  loses motherfucker because he  gets he lines shit up and he 
[03:35:30]  gets it organized he loses two  babies worth of body of with  worth of water weight then  afterwards I drink it back up  after the show well yeah I mean  you got to but there's not that  much water in what you drink it's  all alcohol that's a little  bit yeah yeah Robert Irvine is  gonna call in who's that he's  the one from restaurant  impossible okay he's good  friends with the Cuban and then  the one of the pitmasters from  Nashville is calling in he's  crazy like he has like a bunch  of dogs where he roams his  field when he cook the dogs is 
[03:36:00]  that what makes him great pit  master he should I know but uh  one carries whiskey one of his  dogs carry ice so when he walks  around he just calls the dogs over  and pours himself a little drink  why wouldn't you have that guy  in studio and have the dogs uh  he was in Nashville well fly him  up and have the dogs bring you  some drinks our budget is very  very low what is it zero  dick in the ass dick in the ass  okay uh david in south  carolina hey sam what do you  give your dad for father's day  this year my presence is a  present I don't know what I'm  getting my dad for father's day  I mean I guess an I love you

[03:38:30]  that's a good response that's very  good you didn't care when Opie that  guy didn't win the book by the way  why not because he hung up by the  time we got to him he already hung  up so we still have the kids it's  like a kid's book yeah but if you're a  moron you can't win if you just hang  up the phone when I tell you to hold  on and if he calls back sorry shit  n-word he did use the n-word yeah you  didn't mind when Opie threw you off  the air that time no good are you  looking forward are you gonna be here  for Roland's food court I think I'm  gonna stop by and check it out yeah

[03:40:00]  food from another place because we had  his food last time so we were trying to  rotate so be like fair so we get  different flavor every time you got to  be fair Roland because there's I mean I'm  hearing that all everybody in the chef  community is talking about oh fucking  Roland you know I'm trying to get some  food on his show but all he's doing is  favoring this guy Fieri everybody wants  a turn I know so that's I'm doing good  good good and then you got two  bartenders two bartenders and they're  gonna bring some drinks broads one's a  dude but the thing is this guy's like a 
[03:40:30]  master like he knows how to make the  drinks now is this called the food  court or the sausage fest it's like a  compound party yes what's that mean one  girl all guys well that's why Anthony's  got to recruit the interns will the  interns be there Sydney and Jackie  probably not probably not no you're  tired of hearing from them Troy no I  mean it's just like oh my god you know  like we've we got it we got to know  just space it out a little bit don't  blow your load we're getting right out  of the gate we understand that they're 
[03:41:00]  girls yeah we get they're hot we get  it you know it's like cool just get the  fucking work you're an intern right  shut the fuck up is what you're saying  your work I got you I guess some food  bloggers are gonna send the show they  want to write about it you will have a  press section for your food show yeah  live reporters they're like one of the  tofu bloggers are gonna be here we'll  be in studio studio just hanging out  to observe not just hanging out  working reporting reporting observing  and uh mr guy if you said he said that  up so so this is becoming quite a 
[03:41:30]  happening it's a it's a it's there it's  um there's other chefs who wants to do  it they do not enough time for him he  just said this weekend is Aspen food and  wine so half of them are there the other  half are here they can't do it so in  july i think july or august it's gonna be  a big one you can do another one this  summer one more it's gonna be a probably  like 15 or 20 of them are just gonna all  hang out it's gonna be rolling's food  court is getting magnificent it's gonna  be the top top chefs from like people 
[03:42:00]  will go shit do you people will go shit  how big they are is that ape shit or  just they'll go take a shit go shit okay  actually go defecate people will  defecate they'll be so excited that they  will defecate they'll be the who's who  of the chef world in here well you just  said they'll be 15 to 20 people so it's  gonna be a big hangout ball busting  hangout because they all we don't even  have that many microphones do you think  it's Troy do you think 20 people is  maybe too many guests for two hours  show i mean that's what he did last  time you couldn't even walk through this  fucking studio that's true that's true 
[03:42:30]  as a rolling smile and sweating like a  motherfucker biggie in california you're  on after hope you know a lot of people  say sam why would you why would i want  to listen to this show rolling can't  even talk well this is the genius of  rolling he writes down like six  sentences he reads those six sentences  the rest of the show is everybody else  talking no i gotta say roland it really  does a great fucking job it's a great  show the first time he did i was like i  was blown away with how good it is and 
[03:43:00]  even the last time he had this like  world-renowned like vegan chef on kept  connor the wrong name you don't care he  doesn't give a shit he was drunk he  didn't even give a shit right yeah  that's the thing roland starts out he's  nervous and all he's doing is throwing  it to guests little like quick one  sentence questions and hoping that talk  amongst yourself will happen yeah that's  your goal in the beginning you get that  right you get your two bartenders to  keep passing your drinks yeah keep that  glass full the whole time happy right  and then eventually by our number two 
[03:43:30]  you're fairly well intoxicated yeah and  you're loosened up a little bit you're  ready to have a little fun on the food  court and then uh so the chefs like  david burke the master chef he just had  fun i said you know i and get this i see  david burke at roland's food court and  roland is telling me uh this is a big  chef david burke being here is a big deal  i don't know a wrist watch from a wrist  lock when it comes to chefs however i turn 
[03:44:00]  on the apprentice and pendulet goes yeah  this is a giant deal we have david burke  coming to our event and i go what how did  roland pull this off yeah i don't know i  don't even know who the hell he is  apparently it's a big deal because the  trump was impressed yeah the donald was  excited to see him  and then david burke the donald doesn't  get excited to see just anybody now  like david burke he named himself the  donald yeah and then david burke project  michael simon so like michael simon had a  great time he wants to come back again so  he's gonna come back during the 20 chef 
[03:44:30]  the food court's quite a buzz there's a  bit of a buzz building about this show  especially for a show that's on once  every three months yeah that's why i  think and then i think it's hilarious  that gervais did the voice of my food  show okay true or false  travis was uh updating his linkedin  profile yesterday uh because you know  none of us log into our linkedin things  ever because we're not professionals yeah  i corrected it but he noticed on  roland's linkedin it says uh roland  occupation host roland's food court 
[03:45:00]  sirius xm awesome that's what it said  it doesn't say talent booker it doesn't  say producer it doesn't even say opie  and anthony anywhere near it it just  says host roland's food court i fixed  it because i didn't realize it it flips  the bottom to the top so i went back  and fixed it you've never been a tech  savvy guy no i have not you like that  though what they always promoting the  food yeah the food courts is shit yeah  roland look roland has a tough job  here you know he gets some little perks  but like he has his own show he does a 
[03:45:30]  great job with it he's passionate about  it it really is a good show i'm not  just saying that you know he really  does have a good entertaining show and  he's proud of it why not fuck it i mean  when i was on the crossover the michelle  beetle show the caption under me said  sam roberts and you know what it said  under my name huh the sam roberts show  yeah that's right that's what it said  yeah he said uh she felt like i didn't  think she wanted pro and a she's like  oh yeah i'm just not gonna plug for the  guy so yeah she wasn't quite but she  goes but you're here sam she was  impressed by me yeah you were biggie in 
[03:46:00]  california hey troy i just wanted to  thank you for all the drum and bass  music you bring to the show man that  shit's gonna be huge in america one day  cool thanks man any kind of huge now  uh kind of pretty much it's there right  yeah i mean it's yeah it's there uh  but you're welcome man no sweat bro  manny in arizona hey prime time what's  up buddy hey i just want to say love  doing the crossover i think you and  michelle always have sick chemistry 
[03:46:30]  whenever she comes on the show i love  her but you know i mean i mean i've  never hated joe and right now i think  you're pretty cool thank you but you  know i'll be the first to admit i was  a little envious when this little  squeaky voice kid went from being an  intern to one of the guys on the show  but if you parlay this into a wwe career  man i think i will hate you brother  well you're gonna have to you're gonna  you might have to hate me then because  you know obviously i think the 
[03:47:00]  precedent has been set the sam  roberts train is just continuing to  roll on it's moving forward nothing  will stop it i'm amazed by it myself  quite frankly now is that an arizona  is that an arizona accent that i'm  sensing no sorry it's an australian  accent oh  sorry but hey keep on the roll  sorry  all right i'll talk to you later manny  that was a bobo is in me just there  sorry sorry he's like breathing heavy  it's not like he was jerking off he  was excited to talk to me dude but uh 
[03:47:30]  you get to work with me every day a lot  of people very envious of that i'm a  little desensitized it's crazy isn't  it i think july august we'll have our  first food court music group performing  on the same show with the 20 chefs  it's gonna be a bonanza as i call it  who are the chefs playing did you come  up with that word bonanza yeah i learned  it from the free pebbles back in the  box of bonanza okay i guess it was  there then what's the point of a show  i don't know what are they gonna sing  about i feel like chicken tonight no 
[03:48:00]  these guys are foodies so who well  unless they're singing jingles from food  places who gives up i don't care what  they are if i was doing a wrestling show  and i was like trust me the guy's  singing this song of wrestling fans  all the people listening would still be  like oh no this doesn't answer my  question about the figure four leg lock  they're gonna talk about barbecue they're  barbecue foodies are they gonna sing  about barbecue no no no no are they big  yeah they're a big band yeah who are  they i'll tell you guys later tell me  now no why just give us a hint there's 
[03:48:30]  two of them is it the strokes no i think  i know who is it who do you think it  is yeah i say who i think it is i think  it's the black keys that's it you you're  gonna get the black keys on your show  foodies the manager's working on it do  you think the black keys are gonna be  on the show he said they're working on  it they're not confirmed but the only  thing is like you have to put your foot  in your mouth if you don't get them now  yeah  i don't know  all right and you think in august you're  gonna have 20 chefs in the black keys  on your show 15 though 15 to 20 15 to 20  i mean he's gonna fit all this his show is  gonna become so extravagant that it's 
[03:49:00]  like  you need to rent out the hallway yeah  you need to fucking rent out like a  a theater just to have it  so we could do it at the hard rock  or we could do fishbowl nobody's here  on saturdays fishbowl we could do  um we could just eat there and we'll  have like a food fest just for like five  of us  love that  it's eric in kentucky  hey roland a while back you had said  something about a place in the east  village called  palmas fritz or frites  it's a french fry place that comes in 
[03:49:30]  like this rat  this grease  palm frites  palm frites yeah  oh yeah i didn't say that one the  cubans love that one  that's the that's the kentucky version  of it  palm is frites  i don't know y'all weirdos talk  yeah  i went i went there  okay  speak  well  that'll be that  well  you know  the place is good though it's in my  neighborhood  palmas frites  yeah  yeah it's like  it's a belgian french fries with um  like 50 different dippy sauces  do you like it  i mean french fries it's like 
[03:50:00]  i mean there's only so much you get  french fries  it's a side dish  yeah  right  they don't have main courses  it's fries  but the line's always down the  fucking street  what happens if you want i mean  what are you gonna eat with your  fries  well see i have this brilliant idea  cause like uh  a block or two down  is the best barbecue place  that i have  in the city  and i'm not kidding  i went and it was just down south  that fucking place  what the hell is that goddamn place  mighty quince  mighty quince  their brisket is the best  fucking brisket i've ever had  in my life  yeah that's awesome  okay  i think what they do at the end  they put that little sea salt 
[03:50:30]  ready to give it to you  that's the key  and i'm gonna go get the french fries  from there  and bring it over and have it  with my brisket  smart  the only problem i have with my quince  is there's no refills on iced tea  come on  that sucks  sorry about that  that refills  i bet you do  you know who loves iced tea  sigh from duck dynasty  loves his iced tea  he's always got a cup of it on him  it's delicious  they have sweet tea  and all sorts of things  grinder in arizona  yes that's me  yeah i know

[03:52:00]  prepping for the weekend  bunch of turds  bunch of turds is right  jason in california  hey what's up roland  uh  it's not your food show  you uh  i don't think you should have 15 to 20 chefs on  you need to keep this kind of exclusive you know  15 to 20 chefs as well as the black crows  black keys  yeah exactly  keys  that's ridiculous  which are even bigger  a lot bigger than the black crows right now  we need a uh  a convention center  it's an expo now  do you think that maybe it's getting a little too big 
[03:52:30]  no  no  i don't think so either  you don't  no  you think this is the way to go  well because look  if we  i would rather have it over stacked  right  then like  we're struggling to finish the last hour  also who's going to pop by  so you're thinking by next year  you should be renting out the theater at madison square garden  yeah  yeah  i i i'm all about it  that's why  i say more the better  what about what about for christmas get the rackettes in here  i can do that  i bet they eat food  no they don't  there's your  oh you're right  yeah  maybe we'll find somebody else then 
[03:53:00]  i'm trying to get  i'm trying to get my friend from uh  who's the manager of beauty in essex  to stop by tomorrow  so that's yet another person  and how many  how many people are going to be in the studio tomorrow  40  you're thinking 40  probably 40  40 to 50  let's see one two  katie storm said she's going to be swinging by  that's just some girl who we plugged her twitter one time  two  yeah but she's cool  she hangs  that's not even a food thing  she's hot  there needs to be fucking broads in here  probably in here probably 20 people i'm guessing  it's gonna be all like fat food people  you gotta bring in some chicks  well that's what i'm saying  roland's not booking any chicks 
[03:53:30]  i guess there aren't that many girls in the food industry  there's some  they're usually all plump right  no no i mean  giada de la rentes  she's  she's hot  what about that hispanic woman  who used to be on uh  nigella  no  she's on the taco bell commercials now  taco bell commercials  the chef uh  somebody garcia  oh her  uh  taco bell yeah  no it's like a special chef selection  at taco bell  that's bullshit  you don't think so  taco bell's like  didn't they have like fine like horse meat or something in there  shit  i'm sure that's rumors in here say 
[03:54:00]  yeah right for the border  uh  giada in philly  hey how's it going  good  uh  i've  to be honest  when you first started off in the radio  you're talking about me sam roberts  uh  yeah  i was not a big fan of yours at first  right  but you've really really become a great broadcaster  you know i heard  professional broadcaster is what they say  well yeah but i mean  you've really come into your own  between  the smart ass personality and everything  like you've really done a good job  i heard you interview burke kreischer 
[03:54:30]  recently  he's a man  podcast  yeah  damn good job on that  thanks buddy  any chance i could get a mixtape  yeah  as a matter of fact there is a chance that you get a mixtape  hold on  thank you sir  you love taking those uh self-gratifying calls  sex bagel  get the man a mixtape  see what i like about the food show too  is your face will do my voicing  and he said no to the company department  makes me laugh  well why  why  why do you want bad things to happen to other people  why can't you just be happy 
[03:55:00]  excited  i don't think he wants anything bad to happen  he just wants to  he  roland loves showing his power  he loves  it's like a joke to him  that  that  he can't  the comedy channel can't get them to do  him to do anything  but he gets uh ricky to do a commercial  of promo for his food court  because one minute you're saying  boy sam you love taking those self-gratifying calls  and before i can even respond to that  roland's like  hey by the way guys  ricky gervais did my promo  and wouldn't do anything for the comedy channel  of course  everybody  everybody  everybody right here loves to suck each other's dicks 
[03:55:30]  so you think roland just loves to flex the power  of course  he loves the idea  of the comedy channel  knowing  roland got ricky gervais to do his  so are you cock-blocking the comedy channel  from ricky gervais  no  a little bit  a little bit  no he said no to them  i said do you want to do this  or my food thing  you gave him an or  like  and is not a possibility  but  one or the other  ah fuck them  good  alright  i like your style roland  what food is going to be highlighted on the show  uh 
[03:56:00]  there's going to be probably  uh  it's going to be  between  probably since it's barbecue season  we're going to focus on barbecue  and then uh  there's going to be other foods  that we're going to talk about  like the new uh  up-and-coming restaurants  are going to open up  like the agent fusions  and that  yeah but isn't that a little local  no it's all over  the um  the guy who's opening up the restaurants  is opening up in like  chicago texas  oh okay  vegas  so he's got a little chain thing going on  like yeah different  they're all just different names  but  is there any fast food that you'll eat  and enjoy 
[03:56:30]  i mean i know you'll eat it  you've been to  fast food places  yeah  in and out  five guys  shake shack  and like  those are like  i won't do like the mcdonald's anymore  none of the staples  nah because my asshole hates me after that  it yells at you  oh it screams  it screams gfk murder  right  i'll go for a good wendy's burger  right  you don't have a mcdonald's guy  i mean i'll eat it  like if i'm out on the road or something  that's all there's there  i'll eat it  and when i do eat it  it's like oh yeah i forgot  this is you know  i'll enjoy like a big mac  but i don't really got in my way for it  i love fast food 
[03:57:00]  like what's your favorite fast food  uh  i really like popeyes  yeah  oh that's delicious  i don't eat burgers really  so  i love popeyes  but i'll stop at  pretty much any fast food joint  yeah  and i try to wean off of it  uh  because uh  i feel like fast food  is quickly becoming the new cigarettes  like people are very judgmental of it  they'll see you eating it  and they'll be like  what the fuck is he doing  with that bag of mcdonald's  or  or you know  it's just everybody's trying to get you to not do it  it's horrible for you  blah blah blah  and it's like  well it's kind of delicious though 
[03:57:30]  yeah  but smoking's fun too  right  so it's like  you know  have a cigarette  have yourself an order  chicken mcnuggets  but i do it too  i see people with like a mcdonald's bag  and i just look at them like  ugh  especially if they're fat  it's just like  oh really  yeah i think that's what i do  like when i see people  i saw  when i see people driving  and they're eating mcdonald's  i know i've done it before  but if they're doing it  as if they're fat  i'll be like  what the fuck  yeah  you know if he's like  leaning in with his double chin  yeah  and he's just  he's at a red light  slamming fries down his throat  i'm like come on  you can't even walk while you eat  yeah 
[03:58:00]  if you're gonna eat fast food  walk home  yeah  but if you're skinny  or at least kind of skinny  it's still gross though  it is  it's not good for you is it  it's not  it's not even food  no  it's not  it's just  factory made  it might as well be  you know  it tastes the same  if you go from here to china  it tastes exactly the same  and that's what they  even when i was in sweden  and had mcdonald's  it tasted exactly the same  but that's what they market in  like that's their whole strategy  to make sure wherever you are  that feels like home  because people don't think  to themselves  this really shouldn't taste 
[03:58:30]  exactly the same  a country away  sour cream on it  which is weird  on what  on burgers  on burgers  on sour cream  on mayonnaise  you can take a mcdonald's hamburger  and you can let it out  for like years  and it won't rot  i've seen it  somewhere online  there's an experiment  of like a guy  who just put the patty out  and just left it  i get pissed off at that  because like i don't want  to know  like i like the idea  that people are saying  i'll bet  if you left this out  because then i could be like  yeah nah  nah it's bullshit  but that's why you never hear 
[03:59:00]  of like uh food poisoning  or anything coming from  from mcdonald's  because it's all fucking  like it's all fake  there's nothing real about it  there's nothing that's  gonna poison you  right  it's just gonna pass  directly through you  and get you extremely fat  fat and gross  like it'll just store  in your body  yeah  that's what it is  you're not expelling  if it gave you food poisoning  it'd be fine  because then you'd be  expelling all of it  right  but that's not what's  happening  it's storing  and it's screaming  out of roland's asshole  yeah  is that correct  yeah that's correct  uh 
[03:59:30]  james in oregon  hey sam  what's happening  my friend  hey what's up  with this uh  you don't like rice  no  hey well then  how can you like  popeyes  that's the best thing  going is the rice  and beans  that is true  you know what i like  at popeyes  the chicken  yeah  they have really good  chicken  at popeyes  and i find myself  enjoying that  i gotta have the rice  and beans  with the chicken  my friend  all right  i'll talk to you later  get fries  get some biscuits  the fries are good 
[04:00:00]  i can't see fries  are delicious  those wedges  the wedges  i'm convinced  that black woman  on the commercial  though is cooking  all the popeyes chicken  she's gotta be  she says it's her chicken  right  popeyes is wicked  right popeyes is good  for you  i don't care what  anybody says  good biscuits  good corn  uh  crisp  chris in new  does popeyes do corn  yeah  not on the cob  yeah on the cob  they used to  i don't think they do anymore  uh  what's up chris  hey sam  how you doing this morning  good  uh  in the world  that everything
