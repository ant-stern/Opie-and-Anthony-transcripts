<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony pre-show, hosted by Sam Roberts, started with a recap of Thursday's broadcast, which notably featured a studio visit from Lawrence Fishburne.  Clips played highlighted Fishburne's humorous anecdotes about his experiences with Marlon Brando and Harvey Keitel, including a near-exploding boat engine incident during the filming of *Apocalypse Now*, and a comical recounting of his *Pee-wee's Playhouse* audition where he initially misconstrued the role.  The pre-show then shifted to a discussion of Thursday's contentious on-air gun control debate, which involved Jim Norton sparring with callers.  The ongoing Twitter feud between Anthony Cumia and a user, “Agatha” (suspected to be a white male troll), was also mentioned.  Other topics covered included the L.A. Kings Stanley Cup victory (with commentary on Roland's fluctuating team loyalties) and a viral video of a woman's spectacular post-game ice fall.  Chris Christie's "Evolution of Dad Dance" on the *Tonight Show* was also discussed.  The death of Casey Kasem led to a phone call with Dr. Steve regarding feeding tubes.  Anthony Weiner's latest Twitter mishap – accidentally favoriting a sexting article – was another subject. The impact of readily available internet pornography on the strip club industry was explored, with a DJ from a Canadian strip club calling in to detail the increasingly elaborate and theatrical strip shows being implemented as a countermeasure. The pre-show concluded abruptly before the main show's start.

[00:01:00]  Prepare for the incomparable Opie and Anthony show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Hope everybody had a good weekend.  Welcome back to the grind.  Welcome to Monday.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show where we run down everything that may happen. 
[00:01:30]  May.  Because you never know what's going to happen.  But it may happen on today's Opie and Anthony show as well as what we learned from the last show.  Going over everybody's weekends.  Of course, following along with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton on Twitter.  Figuring out what happened on their weekends.  Sal is working on giving everybody poison ivy.  Because he and a friend of his went camping again.  And they were naked in a sleeping bag together.  I don't know.  I didn't listen to every single detail of the story.  All I know is there's abrasions on his arm now. 
[00:02:00]  I don't know for sure.  But, a lot to get into on today's Opie and Anthony show and Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Call up now if you want to be a part of it.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  We'll talk everything.  We'll talk Kings.  We'll talk Spurs.  We'll talk it all.  But first, I want to talk about a big Hollywood guest we had in studio on Thursdays. 
[00:02:30]  Lawrence Fishburne was here.  Of course, you know him from The Matrix and possibly Pee-wee's Playhouse and many other  things.  But Lawrence Fishburne is one of these actors that you don't see do a lot of interviews.  And we didn't really know what to expect when he came in.  Of course, it was a no-brainer that we were going to take him in studio.  But we don't know if maybe he doesn't like to joke around.  Maybe he takes himself very seriously.  It's hard to pinpoint what these vibes of these people are going to be.  Especially for somebody who's known for playing Morpheus. 
[00:03:00]  You know, Morpheus didn't like to joke around.  Did he?  Well, luckily, Lawrence Fishburne was very different from Morpheus as he came in.  Let's listen to a taste of the one and only Lawrence Fishburne on the show on Thursday.  Let's go to track 10.  I had a lovely friendship with Marlon later on in life and one that I value.  And I learned quite a bit from him.  He was an extraordinary man.  And he would call people really late at night.  And the worst is if you're tired, you're like, oh, shit, but it's Marlon.  Right.  You've got to take the call. 
[00:03:30]  I've got to take the call.  You've got to take the call.  Hello, Marlon.  I've got to get up early tomorrow.  Yeah, you've got to just kind of bite the bullet.  You've got to take the call.  Of course, man.  Of course you do.  That's one of the things you hear a lot about Marlon Brando, though, is people learn a lot from him.  Yeah.  He was an incredibly sensitive individual.  Obviously, he was a huge intellect, Marlon.  And I think that's down to the fact that he was really kind of a curious person, you know.  He had a great sense of wonder and a great sense of curiosity. 
[00:04:00]  I think both of those things made him, you know, the extraordinary actor that he was.  Right.  And you're friends with, it really makes me very jealous that you're close with Colin Quinn.  I didn't know he was friends with you.  Colin, come on.  Oh, my own boy.  Is that true?  Listen, I'll put it to you this way.  I'm going to make you even more jealous because I have to.  You showed me the wound.  Now I'm pouring water.  No.  Colin is probably one of the only people that can get away with calling me Larry.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  If Colin goes, hey, La, how you doing?  I'll be like, yeah, I'm good, Colin.  How you doing?  How did that friendship come about?  Well, we're from the same neighborhood.  We're from the same neighborhood.  Yeah, yeah.  We're from Park Slope.  Colin and I are roughly the same age.  He has a younger brother named Dave.  I had sort of like a play brother named Mike, and they played on the same basketball team.  So we were always kind of crossing paths with each other.  But we've known each other probably since 1970.  Now, I've known Kyle probably since 1970. 
[00:05:00]  Can you, just once, if he calls you Larry in front of people, can you just grab him by the collars and roughly scream?  I said Lawrence!  I said Lawrence!  I said Lawrence!  All right.  It's amazing, going back to the top of that clip.  The people, you don't think, like Marlon Brando has become an entity.  You know what I mean?  Like, you don't think of Marlon Brando as a human being anymore.  And to be talking to somebody who's like, no, we, I knew Marlon.  We had conversations.  We blah, blah, blah.  I mean, it's pretty incredible that he knew Marlon Brando as a human being. 
[00:05:30]  And worked with him and took late night phone calls from him.  I don't know.  I would love to be a fly on the wall and hear those conversations.  I'm sure Marlon Brando must have been the most bizarre human being that's ever existed.  I would love to hear what he said late at night on the telephone.  He went on, did Lawrence Fishburne, to talk about Harvey Keitel and working with him.  Did you do any scenes with Keitel?  I think he was the first one cast in Apocalypse? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, Harvey and I did one scene, first day of shooting.  We're out there.  We're on the boat.  It's the, you know, the whole crew.  We get the boat.  And we take off.  And we go up the river into the mouth of the sea.  And we're supposed to be going wherever we're going.  And so the camera's rolling.  And boom, action.  And we take off.  And the boat has two engines.  But only one of them was working.  So that means we're snaking back and forth.  We've got to do a lot of tacking.  Anyway, long story short, the engine almost blew up. 
[00:06:30]  The guy that was the technical advisor is riding in the bottom of the boat.  And he goes, turn it off!  Turn it off!  It's going to blow up!  So we kill the engine on the boat.  Now we're at the mouth of the river, facing the sea.  So the sea is pulling us out.  And the entire crew has packed up and gone home.  Oh, shit.  So you left us there.  You're just out there.  And we're just out there.  And perhaps we're going to, you know, float to Japan.  Yeah.  So that was the first day of shooting with Harvey. 
[00:07:00]  And I think that was his first clue.  Wow.  Perhaps this film wasn't for him.  I love that.  So working with Harvey Keitel.  Oh, you mean Harvey?  Yeah, I got it.  You knew him.  You were friends.  You call him Harvey.  We don't know him like that.  If you're on hold, I see you.  We'll talk about what's going on today in just a moment.  So stay on hold.  If you want to get on hold, 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969 to get on the horn and talk to the Opie and Anthony pre-show. 
[00:07:30]  Right before we get to calls, one more clip from Lawrence Fishburne because he talked about Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  I didn't think we were going to get any Cowboy Curtis information out of this guy.  But boy, did we.  Let's go to track 12.  Were you part of the Paul Rubens, Phil Hartman kind of crew?  I wasn't part of their crew when they were at Groundling.  Right.  I wasn't at Groundling.  But Paul Rubens and I had a mutual friend who introduced us to each other a couple of years before the Playhouse that I was involved in got started and took me to the Groundling Theater. 
[00:08:00]  And I saw Pee-Wee in one of the first performances that he did.  And I just didn't get it.  And I thought, if this guy, can I cuss on your show?  Yes, please do.  If this motherfucker hits me with a Tootsie Roll, I'm going to knock him out.  So, cut to, you know, four or five years later, whatever, I had seen it.  And, you know, I really didn't get it. 
[00:08:30]  That's hilarious.  It was an audition and I went in to see them and it was for a cowboy and I came in all sort of, I came in very sort of like Yul Brenner from like Westworld.  Oh, wow.  Yul Brenner from like The Magnificent Seven.  And I was the man in gray and I had a bald head and I was like really kind of, you know, serious.  And I did the read and John Paragon, who played Jombie the Genie, and Pee-Wee looked at each other and they looked at each other and they looked at me and they went, 
[00:09:00]  uh, lighter?  And I was like, oh, you mean like comedy?  And they were like, yeah, I was like, oh, okay.  I can do that.  Hey, surprise, surprise, surprise.  Hey, Pee-Wee, how you doing?  And that was how I got the gig.  And they were like, yeah, but there's something missing.  I was like, oh, I'll get a wig.  So I got this crazy cherry curled wig and now I'm like, you know, holy shit.  This very metrosexual cowboy. 
[00:09:30]  But I love doing that.  I mean, I used to compare it to being like on the old 1960s Batman show.  Right.  It's kind of because it was so colorful and just so out.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you finally get it?  Did you finally?  Oh, it's taken me all this time.  I'm just now getting it.  I'm really bummed that Cowboy Curtis's Jerry Curl was not real.  When he said that, that was like finding out the Easter Bunny wasn't real.  That was a tragic thing on Thursday's show.  Also, I would have loved to see Cowboy Curtis knock out Pee-Wee Herman. 
[00:10:00]  Just once, just for the visual of it.  Let's go to the calls.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 here on the Opie and Anthony Pre-Show.  We start with Lou in New Jersey.  What's up, Lou?  Hey, good morning, Sammy.  Morning.  On Thursday, you guys had a nice, intellectual, calm discussion about gun control.  And after the show ended, I saw that Agatha bitch that likes to harass Ant sent out a tweet 
[00:10:30]  to Ant Jim and Opie, which Opie responded to, said, get to hell.  I don't want to be a part of your tweets.  Go away, troll.  I was wondering if that offer that you guys had given her in the past to call in is still  on the table.  Oh, it's definitely still on the table.  Thanks, Lou.  We would love to talk to Agatha.  Agatha is this quote-unquote woman who tweets with Anthony constantly arguing with Anthony  on gun control and race.  And the tweets just go back and forth for hours on end, multiple times a week. 
[00:11:00]  But this person, whoever he or she is, will not call into the show.  The prevailing theory is that Agatha is not the black woman that she pretends to be on  Twitter, but just some white dude who's been trolling Ant for years.  And if it does turn out to just be somebody trolling Ant after all this time, that's a  very creepy thing.  However, I would like to, at some point, hear from this person who, if you follow the guys 
[00:11:30]  on Twitter, has become a celebrity, I guess, in his or her own right.  Nick in Wisconsin.  Sam, how are you doing today?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, we got a little bit of a problem.  I called to talk to you about if Sean F. was going to make a parody song about the consumer.  Uh-huh.  But now when I called you, the call screener, that intern girl, she had no clue who Sean  F. was.  Well.  We got to clue her in on this guy.  He's a legend. 
[00:12:00]  No, you're right, Nick.  And I appreciate the call.  Sean F. is a legend.  She, our interns just started a couple weeks ago, so they're very familiar with who the  consumer is.  I could fill them in on Sean F.  Sal is volunteering to fill them in on Sean F. Of course, Sean F. reached quite a great  deal of fame a few months ago on ONA for making a series of E-Rock parody songs.  The height of his fame was him appearing in studio one day to surprise E-Rock by performing  his E-Rock songs live, which did not go over that well with Mr. Nagel. 
[00:12:30]  Snowy, I see you on hold.  Stay on hold.  But first, we were talking about Agatha and the anti-gun arguments that went on, and then  the civilized discussions, I would say, that went on on Thursday's show.  Let's get a taste of that from track seven.  And somebody said, well, you don't know if that saved their lives.  It's like, well, how the fuck are you supposed to tell?  After they're dead, you could go, well, see, it would have saved their lives. 
[00:13:00]  That, to me, is thwarting some real fucking hurt.  Is that guy in trouble?  That guy did.  No, I think he's fine.  I think that was a good one.  But you see what that asshole did?  That fucking asshole took that situation and just wanted, instead of just going, wow,  that's a great point.  Yeah.  That guy saved his daughter and himself.  Yeah, both sides are doing it.  They stockpile it into their little argument.  Right.  Well, who's to say that?  What would have happened?  We both know what would have happened.  Yeah, yeah.  They were going to rape the girl and probably either kill them or just rob them.  But either way, he stopped the problem. 
[00:13:30]  He stopped it.  It's a great point.  The gun was good.  Yeah, yeah.  Both sides do it.  Yep.  No one wants to listen to the other side in the end.  No.  But I'll tell you one thing.  I think the anti-gun side has the ability to chip away at the right easier than gun owners  have to get it back.  It just seems very difficult to get something back once you've lost a right.  And in America, we do obsess over the guns instead of the mental illness factor. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, there's a huge...  There's a major mental illness factor.  Mental illness factor.  Yeah, why don't we look into why so many fucking people want to shoot up places and  not the tools that are used to do it.  You can take away the fucking guns, but there's still this want for people to fuck other people  up like that.  Look into why that's happening.  I think we got everybody talking on Thursday's show as far as this debate goes. 
[00:14:30]  Jim made his opinion known and started getting the callers riled up a little bit.  There's some of them anyway.  And this guy, Abel, called in and wanted to argue with Jim.  And it was a pretty heated debate.  Let's take a listen to Track 8.  Okay, what about Texas?  What about Texas?  Do you have more people killing their wives and their girlfriends or their husbands in  Texas than you have in California or in New York?  I don't think so.  You might be right.  And I didn't say...  Hold on. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't say for a fact...  I'm supposed to continue to do.  You say I might be right.  It diminishes the value of what I'm saying.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not going to say I'm definitely right.  I'm not going to say I'm definitely right about something.  If I say I might be right...  The problem is, guys like you saying, you're definitely right.  I don't know...  If I don't know something, I say I don't know it.  Okay, okay.  Now, Jim, let me tell you.  I do know it as a fact.  I have looked at it.  So you know...  Hold on.  You know all the other people that would... 
[00:15:30]  Hold on.  Hold on, Abel.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Abel, we're seconds away from hanging up on you.  I'm talking to you and you just keep babbling.  Let Jimmy get something in and then you go back at it.  But if you just get a talk over him, we're going to have to hang up on you.  Like, do you understand what you're doing?  Like, me and Anthony were talking for 20 minutes.  I listened to him.  I poked in there a little bit.  He listened to me.  But you know what I'm saying?  I poked in.  I had a few seconds.  And you just...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I got a few shots in there.  So let...  Go ahead, Jimmy. 
[00:16:00]  I was...  I said from my own experience, I know that there were times where if I could have just  walked in and got a gun, I would have done something really, really stupid and bad.  I've spoke...  I said that that is what I would have done at times.  And I'm glad I didn't have that ability.  And I know enough about myself.  So that was the fucking first thing I said.  So I know that if I have that, I'm not the only one.  And you can't...  You're not going to be able to find the statistics of people who might do that in those moments  if they were able to. 
[00:16:30]  Just like Anthony made a point about you're not going to know how many people would be  saved if they were able to have a gun.  So I don't understand what you're saying.  So we should make laws and we should protect the majority based on hypotheticals that some  people might have a feeling.  Everything is based on a kind of a hypothetical.  We have jails under the hypothetical that people are going to continue to commit crimes.  We continue to hire new police officers because the hypothetical is people are going to continue 
[00:17:00]  to do things that are illegal and dangerous.  But evidence shows that that's a fact.  People will still kill, rape and murder.  We know that as a fact.  Right.  And the evidence on guns is interpreted exactly the opposite way.  The same stats are interpreted exactly the opposite way by two people on the opposite side  of the issue looking at them.  But how is it interpreted the opposite way?  The guy who wants a gun, who wants a weapon to protect himself first says, well, I'm an American.  The Constitution says I have the right to own one. 
[00:17:30]  That's the first thing.  Then I'm a human being.  Common sense says protect yourself.  People will be crazy.  People will be selfish.  People will be wicked.  And governments will be tyrannical.  That is common sense thinking.  I was born in Africa.  I know what it feels like to live in an environment where only some people have rights and powers  to have weapons.  But I agree that people should be able to have.  I agree, dude.  I agree that people should have the right to own guns. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't say you shouldn't be able to own a gun.  I've never said that.  I don't believe that.  I was having trouble placing Abel's accent.  But then he said people will be wicked.  Now, that Boston.  Of course that's where Abel's from.  We were talking to the caller earlier about Agatha, who is tweeting Anthony and Jim and  Opie.  And he brought up that Opie tweeted back to Agatha, I don't want anything to do with this.  I don't want anything to do with this discussion, which I think he kind of made clear when he 
[00:18:30]  was dragged into it on Thursday's show and accused of being a lib as Opie.  People ask, why do I sit out on these discussions?  I don't like going through this exercise.  Well, that's because you're liberal.  No.  What?  That's because you're liberal.  I remember you voting for Obama in 2008.  I didn't vote for Obama.  Jesus Christ.  Obama!  Because I knew that he was going to be the president, so I was rubbing it in.  Because everyone said, there's no way this guy has a shot at the White House. 
[00:19:00]  I've never voted.  I get a lot of shit on Twitter and everywhere else because I've never voted.  And I don't go through this exercise.  And I like that these guys do it because it's very fascinating and great radio.  But I don't go through it because it just seems exhausting because neither side listens.  And I don't care what side either, by the way.  I'm not saying, oh, you should listen or Jimmy should listen.  Well, Jimmy is trying to say that he does listen.  It's so complicated. 
[00:19:30]  Let's go to the phones, 866-WOW-1-WOW, to call the pre-show.  Jimmy in East Rockaway.  Hey, how are you, Sam?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  Good.  I just wanted to know what time it was.  Right now it's 19 after the hour, which means 11 minutes until the Opie and Anthony show begins.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Snowy in Michigan.  How are you doing this morning, sir?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  Hey.  Is that rolling okay?  I mean, the race is lost and all, so I'm just wondering if he's... 
[00:20:00]  You're going to buy a King shirt, so you get some high fives in the subway.  Well, you wonder...  It's a good question, Snowy.  You wonder if Roland is okay.  Of course, the Rangers did indeed lose.  I believe the sports curse is officially over.  The Rangers got the one victory.  It wasn't a complete sweep, but Opie said they were going to go back to L.A. and lose, and  they did indeed.  Dan in Pennsylvania?  Hey, I actually called in with the same thing.  I was wondering if Roland got a jersey, but I got something else on Roland I called about 
[00:20:30]  earlier, but I never got through.  Okay.  I was wondering, did any of you guys at the show ever notice that when Roland laughs, he  sounds exactly like the Crypt Keeper?  I think you've said that before.  I remember hearing that before.  I don't know if he sounds like...  I guess a little bit, but the thing about Roland that's disgusting is that I was on Instagram  over the weekend, okay?  And, like, I see this dude last week.  It's 5 a.m. 
[00:21:00]  He's wearing a blue and red t-shirt and shouting, let's go Rangers, at the top of his lungs in  midtown Manhattan, probably waking people up.  Who is that?  Not three days later, the L.A.  Kings win, and Roland is all over Instagram posting old photos of himself in an L.A.  Kings jersey, as if to say, see, no, I've been on the midwagon since the beginning.  No, I'm just jumping.  I'm not jumping on.  I don't know.  No, the Rangers thing was temporary.  I've always loved the L.A.  Kings.  It was like, oh, come on. 
[00:21:30]  I'm sure he's got his Spurs jerseys already ordered and on the way.  But, yeah, so Roland has traded in all of his Rangers merchandise, apparently for L.A.  Kings merchandise.  He's a Kings fan.  I don't know how many people are going to give him high fives in New York with the L.A.  stuff on, but he's going to try.  Matt on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, Sam, what's going on?  Listen, you're talking about the L.A. 
[00:22:00]  Kings, you have to check out on YouTube, Daryl Sutter.  All right, man, this guy is probably my new favorite head coach only because he could  be the biggest bumbling idiot I have ever seen.  What, Daryl Sutter?  Yeah, Daryl Sutter.  You have to check it out.  He's got a thing on YouTube called Sutterisms.  I think either he's an idiot or he's messing with the reporters, but it is hilarious.  All right, well, I'm going to check it out.  The clip that had us all laughing that I'm sure we're going to talk about on the air today 
[00:22:30]  is that after the Kings' victory, some of the fans were on the ice while the newscaster  was doing his thing.  And this one chick goes on the ice with heels on, and it's the most spectacular ice fall  that I've ever seen.  She falls backwards and then somehow manages to spin her body around so she still manages  to land flat on her face.  It was the most incredible thing, and it's something that we'll watch on the show later 
[00:23:00]  on this morning.  Of course, the Spurs beat the Heat.  We have a news clip of one of the Miami Heat fans saying shit happens on the news, which  is always good.  And Chris Christie, Ant was talking about it a little bit on Twitter.  There's a video that's been everywhere since Friday of Chris Christie doing Evolution of the  Dad Dance on the Tonight Show.  So we'll get into that.  The other big story that, of course, we're going to talk about is the death of Casey 
[00:23:30]  Kasem.  Of course, we all saw this coming on Thursday.  We talked about the feeding tubes that Casey Kasem was on, and they were saying that they  were going to cut them off, I believe.  So it wasn't a surprise, but we had Dr. Steve on the phone to explain the whole feeding tube  situation to us.  Dr. Steve.  Yes.  I did not know that if you're in the same shape as Casey Kasem, and then there comes  a time where you reject fluids and nutrition.  Yeah.  Well, of course, I don't know what his condition is, but here's the thing. 
[00:24:00]  If you think about it, for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years, the way  we left this world was we took to our bed and we stopped eating and drinking, unless you  got shot by a stool or run over by an ox cart or something.  And it's only been in the last, you know, decades that we've had the technology to try  to do something about that.  And at the end of life, artificial feedings don't really help anything. 
[00:24:30]  As a matter of fact, they may actually make the patient suffer more because if your GI tract  is not getting the blood supply that it needs and your kidneys are not getting the blood  supply they need, they start to fail and you're just dumping food into somebody's stomach.  Yeah, but what if it's apple pie?  That is delicious.  What if it's apple pie?  It's delicious.  It's Ensure. 
[00:25:00]  Isn't apple pie delicious no matter what state you're at in your life?  It's absolutely delicious.  Is that what they give them?  Ensure?  Yeah, they'll give them something like Ensure.  There's a whole bunch of different ones.  But what about, first of all, the important thing is when's the last time someone was run  over by an ox cart?  That's what I really want to discuss with you.  That's what I'm saying, you know, in the past.  Yeah, but you didn't need to give examples like run over by an ox cart.  I just love the really weird example.  How many people have been impaled on a butter churn? 
[00:25:30]  Right, he is.  The other story that I really hope they get to that had us all laughing our asses off on  Friday.  I wanted to talk about it on my Friday show.  I just didn't have time.  A new Anthony Wiener story is out there where somebody on Twitter posted a link to an article  that says, what's the, Tinder, that says Tinder is like the mecca for online sexting, and 
[00:26:00]  Anthony Wiener favorites it.  And then he goes, I didn't know, I just clicked the star thing, you by mistake.  I didn't know, like, there is no way at this point in the game that Anthony Wiener does  not know every single function of Twitter.  You don't think somebody has sat down by, look, Anthony, this is exactly how everything  works.  What do you mean everybody can see my favorites?  Hopefully we'll get into that, but speaking of people who can't control what they do with 
[00:26:30]  their dicks, we were talking about strip clubs.  And, you know, I'd always thought that the free online porn had done disastrous things  to the pornography industry, but I had never thought about the negative effects that it  also had on strip clubs.  We were talking about that early on Thursday morning.  Where are we at with strip clubs?  They're terrific.  Are they still hot?  I haven't been to one in quite some time.  Isn't that odd?  Just kind of stopped going.  Yeah.  That's what I'm wondering. 
[00:27:00]  I'm wondering if others...  As real girls?  ...capular as they were when we were kind of coming up.  Because the internet...  That's what I'm saying.  There's so much else going on.  It does a lot.  But if you need a quick, you know, ooh, check that out, just pop on the internet.  Pop in a video, crank one out, and then by the time you're done, you're like, ew, was  I really thinking of going to a strip club?  Yeah.  The second you blast, it's like, ew, was I going to waste money going there?  What's better than when you think of the money you saved as your duck walking to get 
[00:27:30]  a towel?  The penguin walk?  You're like, oh, God, I saved hundreds of dollars by doing this.  You know?  I only ruined one Highlights magazine.  The orgasm is cruel, though.  The orgasm is really cruel.  Yeah.  Because it goes away immediately.  All those fucking, you know, those feelings you had.  Why can't it just slowly go away?  Oh, it's cut off immediately.  It is instant.  Goosey, goosey.  Where you either have some fucking guilt, or you just, you know, move completely back 
[00:28:00]  to what you were doing prior to having that orgasm.  Watch TV, video games, or go to sleep.  Why is it instant?  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain.  It's amazing.  I guess it's...  You could go from horny to absolutely just leave me the fuck alone within seconds.  It's a chemical release, you know?  Right.  That just cuts it right off.  Cuts any level of that urge.  The pituitary gland will shrink back to size, and it'll stop releasing the fluid and estrogen. 
[00:28:30]  Endorphin.  I wonder if that's accurate.  If the do-it-yourself mentality of human beings has taken away from the desire to be in that  strip club place, in the moment of the strip club.  Gavin.  Gavin in Canada.  What's going on, Sam?  How you doing, buddy?  I'm a DJ at a strip club up here in Edmonton, Alberta.  And we haven't really been affected by it too much, because the girls are creative.  I mean, like, I've got a girl who does a Hulk Hogan strip show. 
[00:29:00]  What?  And, yeah, dude.  Like, it's awesome.  And then, like...  Hey, where is E-Rock on this vacation?  And is he in Canada right now?  I know he hasn't been here in a week.  Yeah, but, you know, E-Rock, he could be up here.  He could be up here.  You know, like, she has a partner who comes up and does Hot Rod, and they cut a promo on  each other, and then they, like, start wrestling as they're, like, stripping off.  And, you know, I get to play Real American and all these entrance scenes.  And if they've got themes to their shows, that's what people are going for, the attraction 
[00:29:30]  of the show, right?  So this internet porn has brought back the showmanship in these strip shows.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Like, these girls are, like, doing all kinds of, like, gnarly tricks on the poles.  I mean, like, go to Magic City in Atlanta, and you see, like, girls dropping 20 feet down  a pole.  It's insane.  It's...  They're not wearing...  But when the girl does the Hulk Hogan deal, she's not wearing a fake mustache, is she?  Oh, she's wearing the little yellow fake mustache.  I hate that.  And, like, red and yellow bra on panties. 
[00:30:00]  You know, she's got the whole gimmick and the whole shtick down, like, yellow, like,  hot, high thigh, high boots.  Yeah, she's got the whole gimmick.  I gotta check this out.  Next time I'm up there in Canada, Gavin, I'll be by your way, all right?  No problem.  Anytime.  And, uh, I always take care of the wrestling fans.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  No problem, Sam.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  This internet has brought the pizzazz back.  The show business.  It's nice to know.  Well, speaking of show business, a lot of show business to get to on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:30:30]  show this morning.  Of course, we'll get into Casey Kasem, the L.A. Kings, the San Antonio Spurs, Chris Christie  on the Tonight Show.  Samuel L. Jackson went on Graham Norton's show in England, and he recited his Pulp Fiction  speech.  You know the, uh, uh, well, you know the speech I'm talking about.  He recited it verbatim from memory.  It was amazing to see.  Uh, and a whole lot more.  Hopefully, we get into that, uh, Anthony Wiener story, too. 
[00:31:00]  The only way to find out is to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Lucky for you, it begins right now.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  To be continued...

[01:09:00]  He didn't want...
