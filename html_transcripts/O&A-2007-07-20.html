<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts mocking Preston and Steve for their overuse of "Chocolate Rain," a song Opie and Anthony considered their own.  This transitioned into a scathing critique of Al Roker, lambasting his hypocrisy for calling for Don Imus' firing while later making a joke about epilepsy.  The hosts then discussed a NYC steam pipe explosion, focusing on the extensive road closures and the serious injury of a tow truck driver.  A caller, Tom from White Plains, revealed his terminal lung disease and plans for suicide, prompting a somber discussion about his health. The mood lightened with a review of *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry*, featuring negative commentary and offensive jokes.  The hosts then launched into sexually explicit and crude jokes about a fictional elderly gay couple, Gus and Elmer.  The broadcast also promoted upcoming live shows and guests including Mike Rowe and *The Simpsons* cast members (Al Jean, Mike Scully, and David Silverman).

The show continued with a discussion of "Who's Your Caddy?", a black reimagining of *Caddyshack*.  This segued into another scathing review of *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry*, with specific examples of offensive jokes and criticism of Dan Aykroyd's performance. The hosts then engaged in a lengthy, offensive, and stereotypical comedic segment about Gus and Elmer, satirizing societal perceptions of homosexuality across different eras.  Mike Rowe then joined the show in studio, detailing graphic and unsanitary experiences from *Dirty Jobs*, including working at a charcoal plant, a hurricane barrier, and a bell factory. He described vomiting on camera and other unpleasantries.  The producers of *The Simpsons Movie* (James Brooks, Al Jean, and David Silverman) then joined, discussing the film's production, Homer Simpson's character development, and the filmâ€™s plot, which involved pig waste.  The conversation included off-topic jokes about butt cracks and television censorship over time.

The *Simpsons* producers continued the conversation, focusing on the evolution of television comedy and increasingly strict censorship. They gave examples of censored jokes related to religion, Walmart, and gay stereotypes.  Anecdotes about absurd censor notes were shared, alongside discussion of the changing archetypes in sitcoms and the impact of YouTube and MySpace on privacy.  Mike Rowe then recounted more *Dirty Jobs* experiences, including working with goose wranglers in Alaska (testing geese for avian flu), cleaning a boat boiler, retrieving golf balls from alligator-infested ponds, and visiting the "Body Farm."  Humorous moments included descriptions of a "Bear Kiss" scene and absurd censor notes (replacing Santa with the Easter Bunny).  The segment concluded with a video of a cat playing with a toy (audio missing).

The show then abruptly shifted to crude jokes about food and bodily functions, with Mike Rowe still in studio, despite his desire to leave.  The hosts repeatedly delayed his departure with absurd excuses.  The conversation covered Rowe's experiences with karaoke, QVC, his alleged attraction to animated characters, and getting lost in the woods.  A significant portion focused on mocking a Larry King interview with a severely ill Tammy Faye Bakker, with extremely graphic and insensitive jokes about her appearance and condition, including repeated playback of clips.  Jill Nicolini (who brought a sexually suggestive cake) was mentioned, alongside various callers. The show concluded with more crude humor, listener calls, and promotions for their Mansfield live show, along with references to recurring segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Chocolate rain.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain. 
[00:01:30]  Chocolate rain.  The school books say it can't be here again.  Chocolate rain.  Good morning.  The brains make you wonder where it went.  Chocolate rain.  I wonder if Trish likes this song.  Oh, it's wrestling.  Chocolate rain Friday.  Wouldn't it be funny to be talking about what this meant?  He goes, no, no, I really just meant like it was chocolate in the sky.  Raining.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  It would be tasty.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Trying to get chocolate rain stuck in your head.  And I guess another radio station thought it would be a good idea to do the exact same bit.  What the hell?  What the hell about what?  About that.  Oh, Preston and Steve, you know.  Douchebags.  Can't say that?  No.  Are they doing the same thing?  You just can't say that.  Yeah, they just dumped out of us. 
[00:02:30]  Douchebags.  You know what I mean?  Steven and Preston and Steve are doing this?  Yeah, we got a million phone calls yesterday during our show.  You're not going to believe this, but Preston and Steve have this great idea to play chocolate  rain at ad nauseum, attempting to get it stuck in everyone's head.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  That can't be happening.  It can be.  This business is just filled with a bunch of losers.  That's why we don't really associate with anybody.  Well, that's apparently Philly enjoys that. 
[00:03:00]  Huh?  Apparently Philly enjoys that show.  I don't get it.  We chipped away a little bit.  A little chipping.  A little bit.  We did a little chipping.  Chip more.  This past month we chipped a little bit, but we need sledgehammers at this point, so let's  go.  More chipping.  But, you know.  Just point out what hacks.  That stupid show is showing its true colors, though.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, Danny discovered chocolate rain.  Hoo-hoo.  And now, you know, they're part of the chocolate rain phenomenon, I guess. 
[00:03:30]  Terrific.  Terrific.  Congratulations to you guys.  That's just great.  Good one.  Bastard.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  There's the music.  Good morning.  Good morning.  On this whatever it is Friday, there's a lot of things.  What do you mean whatever?  It's Air Guitar Friday.  Okay.  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  I'm just doing the...  There's Anthony playing the air guitar. 
[00:04:00]  I'm on a little air guitar and just to fit the other day.  It's Mispronunciation Friday.  Mess it's his.  And it's Al Roker Friday.  Oh.  Hey, FMQB.com picked up on the fact that Al Roker blew us off yesterday.  Wussied out on coming on the program.  He was scheduled to come on yesterday.  I guess he wanted to keep it, you know, all light-hearted and keep his phony image of 
[00:04:30]  the nice, happy, jolly, former, fat guy that he has on the Today Show.  Yeah.  Where everyone loves Al when they go to the weather.  Oh, look.  It's Al Roker.  Oh, it's Al Roker.  He's so nice and non-threatening.  Oh, Al.  And he wants to keep that image and knowing that if he was on this program, we would address  the Imus thing.  Well, I don't know.  Hold on.  I don't know what happened because he said yes to coming on our show. 
[00:05:00]  And then somewhere between the yes and yesterday, I guess he got wind of what we were going  to talk about.  I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  Let me tell you what he said yes to.  A whole radio junket.  Right, right.  That's what he said yes to.  He's got something to plug, I guess, which I ain't even going to say, but he's got something  that he wants to plug.  And where was he?  Where was he?  Nowhere to be found because they finally probably said to him, okay, you're on with O&A. 
[00:05:30]  Right, right.  Oh, I won't go on with them.  I heard they were doing bad things, saying bad things about me.  I have an image to protect.  We don't even know that because we never got an answer why he didn't come on our show.  Your epilepsy joke image.  Is that what you're protecting?  Well.  Or your race-baiting, get Imus fired from MSNBC nice guy.  Right, right.  Which one?  Which nice guy?  Well, FMQB.com is reporting Al Roker hides from Opie and Anthony confrontation. 
[00:06:00]  When it comes to discourse over social issues, Al Roker stepped out of his role as NBC weatherman  and came to the plate as social pundit after Don Imus made his now infamous nappy-headed  ho comment.  He called for the MSNBC CBS radio jock to be fired as he didn't want that type of content  in his house at NBC.  Almost a month later, Roker himself came under fire for a joke he made on air containing a  reference to people with epilepsy.  He half-heartedly apologized for the comment, saying he was joking about the logo and not  about people with epilepsy, even though he clearly used the image of an epileptic person 
[00:06:30]  in an attempt at being humorous during a news program.  And that's exactly what we want to talk to Al Roker about.  With that in mind, great radio was set when Roker was scheduled to appear on the XM satellite  radio portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  Today, ONA have been among the few to publicly speak out in support of Imus.  WFAN's Mike and the Mad Dog have also been vocal in their support.  So the stage was set for a debate over the contrasting opinions in the Imus saga, something 
[00:07:00]  that has been missing since the initial news cycle relentlessly chewed and spit out the  story.  Unfortunately, the debate wasn't to be as Roker backed out of the appearance.  He blew us off, Opie told FMQB, leaving the duo high and dry without an explanation as  to why he canceled.  There is no word if Roker intends to reschedule his appearance.  Lance, that's the real Al Roker right there.  I doubt it.  The phony.  Just a phony.  Gotta keep up that image, don't you, Al? 
[00:07:30]  Well, I would like to know why Al Roker blew us off.  Roland couldn't get his people on the phone, all that.  Everyone just went hiding.  Dude, his image is the most, he's the non-confrontational guy.  With the Imus situation, he saw this opportunity to show, hey, I'm a real man.  I'm a person.  I'm a person of color.  Look at me.  Look at me flexing my muscle.  And he goes in there and said he talked to the boss. 
[00:08:00]  And the rest of the time, he's just smiling, greeting the crowds outside of the Today Show  and telling the weather.  Jolly man.  Yeah.  Just in case you missed it, here's the Al Roker epilepsy comment.  Gotta remember, he did this a month after he demanded that Imus get fired for just trying  to be funny on his radio show.  Here you go.  Hypocrisy at its best.  Hold on.  And a little update on a story we told you about yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  Remember that controversial Olympic logo for the 2012 Olympics in London?  Well, some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into epileptic seizures.  Others say it's just downright ugly.  Well, we asked you to weigh in on our website in an informal poll.  And those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around, you were able to  That's a joke about the logo?  Joke about epilepsy.  Those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around? 
[00:09:00]  That's an epilepsy joke.  Simple as that, yeah.  He tried to apologize and say that he was joking about the logo and not about epilepsy at all.  Well, you listen to that clip.  That's a joke about creating an image in someone's head of someone shaking on the floor trying  to get up and cast a vote.  The guy's a phony.  Yeah, see, that affected families out there.  I mean, and we want to make it perfectly clear that Al Roker should be able to do an epilepsy 
[00:09:30]  joke if he wants to.  I could give a crap.  But the deal is here, you know, he demanded that Imus get fired over something that was  pretty similar to that.  But I guess it's not a hot-button thing, epilepsy, as much as race is, right?  So that's the difference.  Epilepsy is a march in big groups.  Yeah.  When they do, they just fall all over and look ridiculous.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no, that's the joke about...  Jimmy Norton.  That's the joke about marches.  Chocolate rain.  Just remember that.  I'm falling down again.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:10:00]  I had my stomach stapled.  Chocolate rain.  And now here's Al Roker's apology.  I mean, listen to this.  Half-hearted.  I do want to take care of one thing, though.  Yesterday at this time, we were talking about that 2012 London Olympics logo and how hideous  it was and how people were being suggested that they were having epileptic seizures by  this thing.  And I started joking about it, and I want to make sure, I want to make this clear, I 
[00:10:30]  was not joking about epilepsy or anybody who suffers from epilepsy.  We understand and know that that is a serious affliction and would never joke about that.  Joking about the logo, not about epilepsy.  And if anybody was offended by that, I heartily and really humbly apologize that I was not trying  to make fun of anybody who suffers from that affliction in their family.  So if you were offended, I apologize.  I didn't want to make that clear.  Let's take a look, show you what's going on as far as your weather is concerned.  It's an excuse.  The big city of the day happens to be Milwaukee. 
[00:11:00]  It's an excuse.  What a puha.  He is a fatso, and he has to say heartily and humbly.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  A few adjectives.  Heartily and humbly apologize.  Why don't you just apologize for making fun of epileptics for the whole beginning of his  apology is an excuse saying that he wasn't making jokes or making light of epilepsy.  He was talking about the logo when clearly when you play that, it's him goofing on somebody 
[00:11:30]  laying down and having a fit.  And we wanted to get into it yesterday with Al Roker, but he blew us off, you know, in an  intelligent manner.  Obviously, I would love to know from Al Roker what the difference is between what Ima said  and what he said and why he thought Ima should be fired for what he said, but Al Roker should  skate.  I wanted to ask the tough questions.  Like, what was the hardest thing for you to stop shoving in your face? 
[00:12:00]  After you got your stomach stable?  After the doctors had to go in and control yourself for you.  Chocolate ring.  Ah, maybe some chocolate ring.  Sounds just like chocolate donuts.  Except it's rain.  Hey, the steam pipe explosion is still the big story here in New York City.  Oh, stupid steam pipe.  It's spread to Boston and everywhere else because now every city is kind of looking at their  steam pipes and wondering if it could happen in their city. 
[00:12:30]  Anthony brought up a great point yesterday.  You know, he drives in from Long Island and because this happened on 41st and Lex, they  had to close streets all the way to 57th Street and all the way down to, what, 30-something?  Dude, there is...  It's like 20 blocks have been closed off because of one major problem in one block.  They cordoned off a perimeter.  That is ridiculous.  Someone's got to explain that to us because every time there's some kind of problem in  New York City, they don't just close off that little area and control it. 
[00:13:00]  They have to close off just miles around it.  I want to take 3rd Avenue up.  That's what I do.  I pop out of the Midtown Tunnel and I take 3rd up and it's a breeze.  And they closed 3rd.  What are you closing 3rd for?  Where is it?  It's at Lex.  It's Lexington.  It's not even the same street.  Leave me alone.  I want to drive up 3rd.  Why are you sounding like Jerry Seinfeld all the time? 
[00:13:30]  I don't want to be a pirate.  Kevin Meany.  A little Kevin Meany?  Yeah.  I heard Kevin Meany and Seinfeld.  It was like a mixture, I think.  Yeah.  He's trying to mix the two.  It's just so goddamn annoying.  We're learning more about the tow truck driver, huh?  Ouch.  What a...  Oh, that's an unlucky lottery.  If you haven't read up on this, a tow truck driver stops at a red light and right where  he stopped is where the explosion occurred. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  He just missed the green.  He just missed it.  Jammed on the brakes to stop.  And then right underneath him, the ground just gives away and bubbling, boiling water  starts pouring into the cab of his vehicle.  He has a passenger in there, too.  Yeah.  She's got burns on her body, too, but not as bad as him.  He's 80% burns on his body in a coma.  You're just sitting there at a light.  Well, they put him in a... 
[00:14:30]  Well, they put him in a...  What do you, adjust the radio a little bit?  You look at the light and go, ah, I just missed that.  I just...  What the hell?  I'm being burned.  Yeah.  But liquid pouring into your car like that...  And here's the thing.  After the boiling liquid, they had to get to him.  He didn't just wind up in the hospital.  No.  He had to sit there with his clothes on, like, soaked to him in...  In boiling mud water.  Probably, like, skin just probably, you know, falling off his body at that point.  Oh.  I can't imagine the guy's going to make it through this. 
[00:15:00]  That's awful.  He's in a medically induced coma, so he doesn't feel the pain.  Yeah.  And the one person that died was a lady who just had a heart attack from the whole thing.  Like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She was in a building nearby, and it just blew up the steam thing, and it was making a hell  of a racket.  Mm-hmm.  And I guess her ticker couldn't take it.  She died.  And then other people, various wounds, injuries from big chunks of the street falling on him. 
[00:15:30]  That thing looked amazing.  Just like a volcano in the middle of the street is what it looked like.  Is there any video of this?  Yeah, they got some closed-circuit, like, security video.  Yeah, I saw that on TV.  But the bus gets in the way.  Yeah, absolutely.  So you can't really see it.  But they keep telling us that there's cameras all over Manhattan, and they say that you're  on camera more than you're not in Manhattan.  And now here's a great opportunity to see some unbelievable footage, and so far they don't  have it.  Well, you see the tow truck drive by. 
[00:16:00]  Then you see a couple of buses that were behind it pull into a frame, so they block the tow  truck, the view of the tow truck.  If the buses weren't there, you'd have seen it.  And then, boom, it goes off, and you just see people running and see all the steam.  You see the actual start of it, the actual initial explosion.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's on security cameras, which are pretty much everywhere.  Hey, was that just the explosion, E-Rock?  Yeah.  E-Rock. 
[00:16:30]  Was there a noise that was going on first or something?  Let me check.  Hang on.  I mean, we need to know more details.  Like, I'm looking at shaky camera work, like the guy is just...  Tipping a...  Tipping the camera at...  Recording Bigfoot.  Yeah, well, come on, dude.  What are you doing?  And then...  People just panic with cameras when something goes on.  Yeah, I think the guy missed it, too.  Good one.  There's no explosion in there.  The guy obviously has a video camera running, and what we get is the sidewalk.  All shaky to the point where you have to go to the bathroom and throw up. 
[00:17:00]  Amateurs stink on camera.  Well, something obviously...  He obviously probably heard it...  You probably would have missed it anyway, because he opened his camera once it happened.  Like, he probably didn't say, I sense an explosion coming and get his camera ready.  I know.  He's probably just happening, and then he's going, fumble, fumble, fumble.  Jimmy, you're absolutely right.  The best part of these type of videos is there's some tourist somewhere that actually has the explosion.  And then a month from now, when we all forget about this story or move on or whatever, all of a sudden, this video will be displayed on a news channel. 
[00:17:30]  Like, you know, they finally decide to hand it in or something after showing all their friends back home.  Well, on 9-11, I mean, there's the second plane, of course, but on that first plane, there's two different shots of that first plane hitting.  There's the one that everyone has seen a million times.  The guy that was doing the documentary on the fire department.  Yes, yeah.  And there's another one from farther away.  It was a guy doing...  I forget what he was doing, why he had a camera.  Well, the towers were always being photographed.  You know, a lot of people would just videotape the towers. 
[00:18:00]  I think constantly, somebody had a camera on there and it was being videotaped, either from the Jersey side or here in New York City.  So, it's not that odd that you got a couple of views of it happening when it happened.  Okay.  I thought I had a point.  Sorry.  Sorry to trip you up on that.  I'm sorry.  Hey, well, you know, though, the brown water...  Brown water.  That was just dripping down.  It reminded me of something.  That's what it was.  Tosslet ring. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, wow.  They got the...  They're not feel guilty by saying it.  Oh, of course.  Hey, behind you, they got the live shot on the news here this morning.  There's the guy's tow truck right in the middle of the big hole in the ground.  Still in the crater.  Why haven't they removed that tow truck?  I don't know.  That's just such a creepy, creepy shot right there.  The guy was just stopped there.  The tow truck in the middle of the crater where the explosion occurred.  Let's say hi to Tom in White Plains.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I don't want to tell you.  They cordon off such a large area because all the steam pipes are wrapped in asbestos. 
[00:19:00]  And they want to clean up the air.  That shot of the tow truck is really eerie.  Creeps me out.  As much as your voice?  Are you a little person?  Sir?  Tom?  Okay.  Are you a little person? 
[00:19:30]  I'm not that tall.  Yeah?  How short are you?  I'm 5'6".  Oh.  Okay.  Because you got, like, that voice going on a little bit that, um...  A lot of, uh...  Oh, my God.  This guy's creepy.  Tom, what's your deal?  Come on.  Come on.  Give it up.  What's your deal?  Is your last name Thumb? 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my first dad.  Yes, it is.  You got me.  You got me.  Oh, he fights back.  I like that you fight back, Tom.  Scrappy.  But we're all noticing that your voice is a little different.  We're wondering why.  Are you willing to share with us?  Progeria?  Uh, I just woke up, and I have a lung disease.  Oh, God.  Oh, a lung disease.  What do you have?  Cystic fibrosis?  Uh, no.  Something that you probably never guessed.  Cystic fibrosis. 
[00:20:30]  What does that mean?  And what does that do to your poor lungs?  It's when you...  Uh, actually...  It attacks any part of your body, but, uh...  It's, uh...  I lost about 40% of my lungs, so...  Oh, how old a guy are you?  I'm...  I'm 42.  Oh, my...  Oh, my...  What cause is that?  They don't know.  Toss, let rain.  Oh.  Can't take a deep breath again.  Toss, let rain. 
[00:21:00]  I'll never sing deep again.  Toss, let rain.  Hey, Tom has a sense of humor.  Oh.  Wait, I do...  Is it hard for you to breathe?  When I hear someone's lungs, I'm like...  Is it hard to take a deep breath?  Yes.  Yes.  Uh...  Yes.  Walking up hills is difficult, walking upstairs.  Uh...  How about dales?  Down is easy, because they just fall.  But, uh...  It's the up is the hard part. 
[00:21:30]  Yes, sir.  Normally, the down is not the strength.  Yeah, yeah.  This whole fighting gravity thing.  Do you...  Do you, uh...  Have, like, oxygen that you use?  Uh, no, I've been fighting that, because once you start using it, you become very dependent  on it.  Yeah, but it might be pretty good.  You hook one up to a little rascal, and then you just give up on life.  Exactly.  How'd you know you had it, man?  How'd you know you had it?  Yeah, what happened? 
[00:22:00]  Uh, I was diagnosed, uh...  I was diagnosed in 2000.  I was noticing, uh...  I worked up, uh...  Well, a hospital.  Oh, boy.  And as I was walking up 96th Street, I said,  Boy, I know we're getting out of shape.  And, uh...  I woke up thinking I'm having a heart attack.  Uh...  And, uh, went to work, and then...  Went to work.  Why would you wake up thinking you're having a heart attack and go to work? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, well, he works at a hospital.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay, that's different.  Let's call it two birds with one stone.  Yeah.  That's like he was going to Starbucks.  I'm clocking in and going to the ER.  Right.  Well, at first, I ate eight pieces of bacon.  Right.  Figure what the hell.  I'm in good hands, right?  Damn, there's nothing they can do about this?  I drank heavy cream.  And absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  I take, uh, some asthma medication just to help me breathe a little better, but that's it. 
[00:23:00]  So, are you going to live with this, or is it going to get worse?  What are we talking about here?  Can't they transplant, uh, do a lung transplant on you?  Uh, well, that's, uh, an option, uh, in a couple of years.  It also affects my heart.  Oh, my God.  And, uh, I'll probably just drop dead one day.  Oh, my God.  We need all the fans we can get.  Goodness gracious!  I love you.  I love you guys. 
[00:23:30]  I, uh, I listen to you every day.  Wow.  And, uh...  Oh, my God.  You guys, you guys make my day.  All right.  You know, just to make sure he's a, he's a big fan.  Yeah.  What's, uh, what's your favorite part of the Opie and Anthony show?  Like, what's your favorite bit?  What's your favorite thing that we do?  I can't do this.  Do it.  Anthony?  I, I, I can't.  Yeah?  Uh, when you do the voices, uh, especially with the little megaphone, uh, and, uh, and 
[00:24:00]  it's like, uh, something that's happening to me, I'm getting emotion in my body, I can't  do it.  He likes the little megaphone.  Yeah, yeah, you like the voices I do with the little megaphone?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Hi, um, my name is Parrot Lungs.  Oh, poor guy.  Hey, uh, a lot of suggestions coming in.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Uh, Tom, can you repeat this?  Uh, the plane, the plane.  Oh, God. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  The plane, the plane.  Oh, the, the poor guy.  Well, no pity.  He doesn't want pity.  And somebody wants you to do the diabolical laugh today.  Oh.  But that could just cause a hard time.  I know that.  Jeez.  We don't want that on our conscience.  Oh, I can't breathe that.  What's the most physical activity you can do, like, on the average?  Uh, I, I try to walk, uh.  Oh.  Well, that's depressing.  At least a mile every day.  At least a mile, huh?  Yeah, in, like, malls. 
[00:25:00]  And, because, uh.  Because you want to horrify everybody.  Because you're a pedophile?  Imagine.  Some days it's tough.  All I can do is fold a piece of loose leaf.  It's never too late to learn.  Oh, someone's suggesting, uh, for him it would be a diabolical laugh.  Oh, wow.  Yes, sir.  Oh, no.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  We got you now.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Come on.  Old easy wider lungs. 
[00:25:30]  You're supposed to do it three times, but we'll accept one from this guy.  Yeah.  The diabolical laugh has to be three.  Three of them, not one.  No cure.  No cure for this, huh?  Don't do that.  You're wearing your lungs out.  I know.  That's still one.  Uh, you, you got it.  Oh, look, he's breathing heavy.  I know.  Dude, you're breathing heavy.  Three in a row.  I can't do that.  Don't.  All right. 
[00:26:00]  That's what you have editing for.  What do you, what do you have a little, uh, like, uh, uh, one of those asthma things  that you spray into your lungs?  Uh, uh, inhaler.  An inhaler.  Yeah.  How much do you weigh there, Tom?  Tom, how much do you weigh?  I weigh, uh, actually, I'm a little, uh, heavier than you than I, I weigh 170.  Okay.  170 at 5'6"?  Yeah, I like to do this from time to time.  Um, if you think, uh, well, why don't you keep talking, Tom, because, uh, you don't 
[00:26:30]  have much time to live.  Yeah, just let him talk.  Get it all out.  Uh.  Well, the weight gain was from prednisone.  Oh, it was?  Oh, yeah, well.  What do they, what do they do?  They, you have to have a, take it with water and a candy bar?  Yeah.  They shove it in a pork chop.  Yeah.  That drug will just.  Take it with water in the refrigerator.  Yeah.  Uh.  That, that just distorts your face and other parts of your body.  It's a terrific drug for everybody.  Yeah.  All right, Tom, it's not about you. 
[00:27:00]  We got to move on.  We have a radio show to do.  Try to stay, stay alive and give us a call at some point.  Yeah.  Hey.  How about this?  New bit.  New bit.  New bit.  Tom, you call us every Friday and then, you know, Friday goes by, we don't hear from you.  We know what happened.  Yeah.  All right.  And there'll be a relief every Friday when you call.  People will be like, oh, wow, he's still alive.  Thank God.  All right.  Let's do this.  You can listen to me blow my head off.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, well, that's one way to solve your problem.  What do you mean by that, Tom?  He's going to stand on 43rd and Lex.  When I can no longer walk, I figured that's what I'm going to do.  You're just going to blow your head off?  Yeah.  Nine millimeter, nine millimeter Beretta.  Yeah, you got one?  I'll point.  You got it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're just waiting.  Wait, so this is really what you're going to do eventually?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Well, eventually.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  How long do they give you before you reach that point where you can't really walk and  you got to blow your brains off?  Out.  They don't.  They just say, yeah, well.  Well, they didn't give you a date.  One day you're going to wake up and maybe that's not going to happen anymore.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you buy a gun just for that, dude?  But.  Wait, Tom.  Did you buy a gun just for that?  No, I had the gun from a job. 
[00:28:30]  I used to work for an organization.  So, Tom, we're learning today.  We're learning today when this gets really bad that you have decided that you want to  go out that way.  Well, I first thought about poisoning.  I have enough narcotics to kill a small army in my safe, but that's too easily to be found. 
[00:29:00]  This way, boom, it's over with.  Yeah, you don't want to take any chances, right?  Yeah.  And then they try to bring you back.  And then even you're worse off.  You wake up, you're even worse off in the hospital.  You're like, oh, now I'm brain damaged.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Hey, Fat Spanky from Dublin, Ohio.  He writes, who's his favorite band? 
[00:29:30]  Weezer.  Oh.  Dude.  He likes the police song, Every Breath You Take.  Yeah, can we play Every Breath You Take for this poor fella, please?  Make him happy.  Hey, Tom, can you do a rock scream for us?  No.  Well, Dave from Woodbridge is suggesting that Tom do a rock scream.  Kill the guy.  He's a fan of the show.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's hear your rock scream.  I don't know if I can do it.  No. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  No, no.  He can't do a rock scream.  Maybe I'll go on next Friday and try.  Yeah, he's got to work.  He's got to inhale a week.  It's like, for a week.  No, Tom, you don't understand.  Now, like, we have a vested interest in you.  You have to call next Friday.  We have to know how you're doing.  All right?  Okay.  And if you don't call in next Friday, we're just going to assume, you know.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You better call in or we'll be depressed. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Here's your song.  Okay.  And we got a song for you and everything.  This song is for Tom.  A new friend.  Tom from White Plains.  Tom, any...  What's up, guys?  Huh?  Checking out.  All right.  Well, not literally, right?  Just punching out for today.  Right, Tom?  Yeah.  All right.  Hang in there, Tom.  Every breath you take, there it is.  Good luck to you, sir.  There he goes.  Tom from White Plains.  That is depressing.  No kidding, man.  He's not amazing.  He's serious.  Yeah, I know he's serious.  And, you know, what are we supposed to do? 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  Tell him to keep living?  Sounds like it's hell on earth.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  All right.  Tom will call us next Friday.  We'll see how he's doing.  I'm sorry.  That took a little bit of a turn, huh?  Ah, it's interesting.  Everyone's got their cross to bear.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Give a hollow point bullet gun.  By the way.  Like, ah, there's the final option.  There it is.  At least he's got his plan.  By the way, I like to do this from time to time. 
[00:31:30]  If you think your life sucks, we all think this from time to time.  Like, ah, my life just stinks.  Blah, woe is me.  Wah, wah, wah.  Right?  Wah, wah, wah.  Try to search out the latest picture of Tammy Faye Baker.  Did anyone else see this on Larry King the other night?  Yeah, last night.  She's down to 65 pounds and still wearing the makeup.  Yeah, she wears the makeup.  She's still wearing the makeup that she's famous for.  If you think your life sucks, find a picture of Tammy Faye Baker and look what she's going through. 
[00:32:00]  Is she really?  Is she obviously anorexic?  Do you want to see the picture?  No, she's dying of lung cancer.  She should have been dead by now.  Larry King asked her, Tammy, have the doctors told you how long you have to live?  And she said, I told the doctors, I don't want to know how long I have.  I just want to live my life.  She should be dead any second now at this point.  Tammy, have you taken any garlic?  I hear that's good for the big casino. 
[00:32:30]  How about Welch's grape juice?  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to fatten up.  Wow, we're really late because of Tom.  You look like a sack of antlers with Crayola crayon on it.  We've got to find the picture.  It was on the insider last night.  If we tape the insider, you can get a still off the insider for everybody.  We'll throw it up on the website.  Coincidentally, you could see her insides on the insider.  She's transparent.  All right, we've got to break. 
[00:33:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got lots going on.  Don't forget, you can go to Comic-Con in San Diego with Sam, courtesy of our good friends  at NBC.  Of course, Sam, one of the members of the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll get a sneak peek at NBC's new fall shows, Bionic Woman and Chuck, and see the cast  crew of Heroes, talk about their new season, and see the latest sci-fi screenings.  All you have to do is log on to 923krock.com to enter, to win a trip to Comic-Con in San 
[00:33:30]  Diego with our own Sam.  All right?  Phone number 877-212-5762.  It's FU Friday.  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  It's Mispronunciation Friday.  It's Al Roker Friday.  Yes.  Wow, what a busy Friday.  And he wants to the list, because some of the faithful listeners keep track of this  crap.  Yes.  Is Tom Alive Friday has begun.  That's good.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  He's going to call now.  He's got this lung disease. 
[00:34:00]  We just spoke with him.  And he's going to call every Friday until he just doesn't call, and then we'll know what  happened to Tom.  You know, it's kind of a creepy bit, because I know what's going to happen.  I was just thinking about this in the bathroom.  This is going to end with us going to someone's funeral.  Because the more we talk to him, the more we're going to kind of get to know him.  Right.  And then when he doesn't call, and we find out, you know, we get that email from a family  member.  Guys, Tom really enjoyed your show.  We lost Tom last night. 
[00:34:30]  The wake will be, oh, no.  Now, all of a sudden, we have to go to a wake.  He hung on, and I just want you guys to know that through all of his turmoil and health  problems, he found laughter in your show, and then it's like, oh, where is it?  Yeah.  Can I send money in lieu of an appearance?  I was in the bathroom, and I'm standing over doing my thing, and I'm thinking, oh, I know  how this is going to end.  We're going to be out of wake.  It's going to be hundreds of listeners there, because we just got to know him today. 
[00:35:00]  But every Friday, we're going to ask him about his life, what he did, how he grew up, his  favorite band, his favorite TV show, what movies he enjoyed.  We're going to feel like we know this guy.  And we failed to mention, just in case you're tuning in, the guy just openly admitted that  he will kill himself when he gets too bad.  Yeah, if he can't walk and gets to the point where his lungs can't even, where he can't  breathe, he's going to shoot himself in the head.  And I'm all for that.  Yeah, whatever he wants to do.  I'm all for, like, you know, taking control of your own ending, especially if you've got 
[00:35:30]  some horrific disease that's just eating you away.  Yeah, if you've got some physical ailment that you're just wasting away like that.  Yeah.  I'm all for assistance.  Some people are very religious, though, and think, you know, you take your life and you're  going to hell.  And since you stretched it out so long and suffered so much that the Lord owes you something.  So you wait until you drop dead naturally, and then a right-handed gut.  And Tom has decided it's going to be with a gun.  Yeah.  He's decided that. 
[00:36:00]  Even though he has a lot of drugs and some kind of, what, like, safe or something?  Enough drugs to poison himself?  Yeah.  But he thinks he might wake up in a hospital brain dead.  All brain damaged.  Or damaged, and he doesn't want that.  I have to correct you, though.  I don't see this ending with all of us at a wake.  Okay.  I see this ending with the phone call.  We lost Tom.  Yeah.  I hear us saying, well, too bad, because I have to go home and do something with my Shelby.  Right.  And I'm on the road, and you just want to go to Philly and mellow out.  But we'll send some money, and then Monday we'll do a retrospective where we just play 
[00:36:30]  his clips with gunshots over the gunshots over them.  All right.  With the music, I will remember you playing in the background.  You're right, Jim.  Jim's got it all planned out realistically.  I see.  I hope he's the dreamer.  Jimmy's a realist.  I see the Sarah McLachlan song being played once again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, someone is saying, who is it, Nate Sack from Jericho, next Friday, Tom will forget  to call, and everyone will forget about him. 
[00:37:00]  Someone is saying, and this is good news, Joel from Jersey.  My dad has the same thing.  He's had it for 30 years now.  You may have a long wait.  Well, we're hoping.  Oh, okay.  We're hoping we have a long wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  But the guy already can't do the diabolical laugh.  No.  He runs out of steam or breath when he's walking upstairs, and he can't do a rock scream.  No.  He definitely knows he can't do a rock scream at this point.  I mean, I think, don't we have clips of people who are, like, screaming and running out of 
[00:37:30]  breath at the end of it, but they're still, like, healthy people, right?  Well, I wouldn't exactly call them healthy.  Well, compared to Tom, I mean, this kid's an Olympic athlete.  Olympic athlete.  Who are we kidding?  Our own E-Rock.  In other news, as we try to find that clip that Jimmy wanted.  I want these whittled down to one template.  Yeah, we're going to work on that behind the scenes.  But let's not forget, Mike Rowe will be in studio, a good friend of the show. 
[00:38:00]  He's going to be doing a couple hours with us today.  And also, we've got the guys from The Simpsons coming in today at 8.15.  That's going to be really cool, talking about the new movie.  Speaking of new movies.  Oh, it's Jill.  Sorry.  What, what?  Jill TV.  Wow.  Look at how low cut that is.  Holy mackerel.  Yeah, she was great on our show yesterday, huh?  Yeah.  She was really, really cool.  The pictures are up on our website.  Her appearance on our show, finally.  Jill from Jill TV was in here yesterday. 
[00:38:30]  Jill Nicolini.  Speaking of movies, I mean, come on.  Who's not going out and seeing I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry this weekend?  Come on!  Oh, you just bring it up and I start laughing, thinking of the ads I see.  And now it's being reviewed in the paper.  And am I mistaken here?  Or am I just seeing a bevy of four-star reviews in the paper for this hysterical movie?  I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry. 
[00:39:00]  How about you just call it Chuck and Larry?  That's what I call it because everyone knows what you're talking about.  Hysterical.  How about this?  A couple of mows.  But Anthony was reading some of the reviews in the paper today.  Just laughing and laughing and laughing.  Ben.  Just laughing his ass off.  Dude, I gotta tell you.  Well, let's listen.  This ain't even the review.  I want to listen to the preview. 
[00:39:30]  The post one.  Because it just gets me.  You know, one star.  And I want to listen to the preview.  Because it just gets me jacked to see the movie after the show today.  So excited.  Larry had a problem.  Trying to get my pension changed to my kids.  Chuck was his solution.  Domestic partnership.  We're not gay.  We're not gay.  We're not gay because they're not gay.  Already it's unfolding.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he has to transfer.  Oh, it's fantastic.  But they're not gay.  And then there's the really funny twist. 
[00:40:00]  He has to get his pension switched to his kids.  Yeah.  Because both of his kids have no legs.  Right.  That's just my idea.  That's part of the funny.  Someone, and his name is Sam.  Sam's camera, actually.  Sorry.  Going old school on us.  I now pronounce you Gus and Elmer.  Oh, yes.  What was the story of Gus and Elmer again?  I remember they were two very, very, very old gay guys.  Just two old fruits that couldn't get enough of each other.  Weren't they together for 60 years and then finally decided to get married when this whole 
[00:40:30]  gay marriage thing popped up?  Is that the story, right?  Very close to it, yeah.  I think so.  Can we get some Gus and Elmer stuff for everybody?  At least a story?  Because I want to refresh everyone's mind.  But thank you, Sam's camera.  I now pronounce you Gus and Elmer.  All right.  Let's get back to the terrific preview or commercial for I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  We're not gay.  You're the only person I trust.  Oh, God.  Wow, that was believable.  Oh, God. 
[00:41:00]  That was some great acting.  You're the only one I trust.  Is that it?  No, it keeps going.  I just want to keep stopping it and making fun of it.  You're the only person I trust.  Oh, God.  On July 20th.  You may kiss me out.  On July 20th.  July 20th.  That's the something's funny coming from the announcer voice.  Yeah.  It's the worst voice.  Yeah.  It's the same voice that is used for every Steve Martin movie and every freaking...  Yeah.  Yes, what do you got there, Sam?  This is his funny delivery, though.  And also notice that the part of the priest is played by a sort of racist caricature of Rob Schneider. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, Rob Schneider plays an over-the-top, I'm talking Jerry Lewis-era Asian guy with the stereotypical, like, World War II propaganda teeth and glasses and hair.  Does he have the Fu Manchu type thing?  A long Fu Manchu?  In a stereotyped Asian dialect.  Yeah.  And that's, like, one of the gags in the movie.  And that's okay because it's for a movie. 
[00:42:00]  You do that on radio, for some reason, there's a different standard.  You're not allowed to do that on radio anymore.  No.  You're not allowed to do it in movies.  In movies, it's a scream.  It's hysterical.  Everybody laughs, including a lot of the people from the Asian community.  Laugh and laugh.  They understand it's a joke and they're just messing around and going for a laugh.  That's just because you can't bully the movies as hard.  They're not in one position.  Elmer left 84 and Gus, 88, who hid their sexual orientation for 58 years, were wed in Canada. 
[00:42:30]  I love these guys.  In the language of their generation, Gus and Elmer were friends.  They worked together, took cruises together, and sang in the same church choir.  They lived together for nearly six decades but never held hands in public.  Then last month, Gus and Elmer, remember, Gus is 88, Elmer is 84, crossed the Canadian border near Niagara Falls, and they were married.  We eloped. 
[00:43:00]  Said in his Manhattan apartment one recent afternoon before breaking into song,  To Niagara in a sleeper, there's no honeymoon, that's cheaper.  Then he paused and his tone shifted.  We waited a long, long time.  Gus and Elmer did not marry for political reasons, financial reasons, or legal reasons.  Through their 58 years together, they mostly stood by as others fought for rights like civil unions or domestic partnerships.  That's great.  It goes on and on.  They met on the beaches of Normandy. 
[00:43:30]  They both took a shot to the head, but it was before they even left the amphibious craft.  Yeah, I like the fact they both stood by.  Gus stood by.  Elmer knelt.  Yikes.  Yeah, I think that Elmer was more of the giver in that.  Yeah.  Turkey neck.  Oh, God.  Nothing sadder than two old queens, especially when they become one. 
[00:44:00]  One of my favorite gay observations comes from Anthony about the act that gay men do.  Yes.  And Anthony says, leave it to the young.  Just leave it to the young.  Gay sex.  I'm not talking about gay love either.  Right.  I'm not talking about gay like that.  Like old married couples, men and women.  Right.  Sometimes they go years.  They don't have sex anymore.  They're just, you know, they live together.  They do whatever.  Gay guys might be the same thing. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  You know, a little peck on the cheek.  One's off to work.  One's doing this.  Whatever.  But I'm talking the hardcore gay sex.  Please leave it to the young.  It just should be left to young men.  Because old guys doing that.  Wow.  Wowie.  That's just heebie-jeebies.  Leave it for the young.  It's one of my favorite things.  Do you think it's creepy if they're kissing in the middle of it? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  Dude, one really dry mouth due to medication.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  One mouth is wet and moist.  Oh, my.  It's biotene toothpaste.  Oh, my.  Biote.  And the other is very dry with that white stuff in the corner of the mouth.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Because otherwise his heart doesn't work properly.  Oh, my God.  You get dry breath.  You get dry breath.  You open your mouth.  There's that white spittle.  Oh. 
[00:45:30]  Teeth sitting in a glass on the night table.  Well, at one point, yeah.  Just put them in the glass.  Yeah.  Put them in the glass.  You know how I love it when your teeth are in the glass.  That's how he knows it's about to get.  When he hears the fizz of the effort end.  He knows actions are coming.  Yeah.  The zipper comes right down when he hears a.  Of those stupid teeth having blueberry stains removed from them.  Just the thought of one guy laying in the bed all, like, excited and ready to go. 
[00:46:00]  And then the other guy taking off his Fred Mertz pants.  Going to have some fun tonight.  Aren't we, Rick?  Thank God we brought back Gus and Elmer today, man.  Gus and Elmer.  Oh, it's one of our favorite stories in the last year or two.  Good old Gus and Elmer.  84 and 88, still going strong.  Yeah, they are.  Actually, this was a year ago, so now we're talking Gus is 89 and Elmer's 85.  Elmer.  Or Gus gets stuck to Elmer because his fixident, the adhesive fixident just gets stuck. 
[00:46:30]  So he has to open his friend's mouth and dump in, like, hot coffee or something that will  loosen the fixident.  It's like pulling a bottom-feeding catfish off the side of your tank.  Oh, you got a picture of them in the 40s?  Oh, wait.  There they are.  Being shaped by a mob.  Trying to hide, yeah.  Strapping young men in this picture.  Look at that.  Hubba, hubba.  Look at the stems on that broad.  Oh, I hope they don't kill us.  That's pretty much where they were at. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Now they were trying to act like they like women.  Look at the stems on that broad.  Nice stems.  23 skidoo.  She sure is beautiful.  Right.  Here we go.  And here are two men.  Let's get off the boat now.  Gus and Elmer.  You boys have now won the war.  The war is over.  You're here in Times Square having a gay time.  That means happy.  It's the 40s.  Why are you giving me a weird look?  Just because I said gay time.  I said a gay time. 
[00:47:30]  The whole city is gay.  Isn't the city gay now that we've won the war?  Look, people are dancing and singing in gay fashion.  And here's Gus and Elmer really being gay.  The reporter notices that Gus and Elmer are the only ones not going for the kiss.  Yes, wait a minute.  Gus is in a sailor suit and Elmer's wearing a dress.  They're kissing in Times Square.  It certainly is a gay mood here in Times Square. 
[00:48:00]  I now pronounce you Elmer and Gus.  Hysterical movie from the 40s.  They're running from a mob of intolerant people who want to beat them because they're gay.  Chasing them with pitchforks and torches.  Thank God they got thrown off the track because they found a couple of Negroes eyeballing a white woman.  Run, boys.  Run.  All right, listen. 
[00:48:30]  We have just begun with this.  We're not going to let go of Gus and Elmer anytime soon today.  No.  They probably said each other's names in the middle of it.  You know, they did.  Like, not even like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, like the one had sweat dripping off his face into the eyes and mouth of the other one.  Oh, God.  You know, he's an older man and the medication makes him sweat.  Medication.  Gus.  Elmer.  I love you, Elmer.  You think they go to Sam's Club for Viagra? 
[00:49:00]  Just a big.  A big barrel of it.  Right.  They scoop in like when you're a kid and you put a quarter in and that thing goes into the machine and picks up a toy.  His old man hand just scoops in there.  It's got fecal matter on his finger.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What?  He's an older gentleman.  He gets nervous.  He's in a rush.  I don't know how to quit you.  Hey, they fought back Mountain because his back really is sore.  It really hurts.  They fought for our country, guys. 
[00:49:30]  Guys.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll play the rest of the terrific.  Trailer for I now pronounce you chucking loud.  Oh, yeah.  And then got to read some of the review because they have some of the hysterical lines and situations from the movie.  Yeah.  And you're just not going to want to miss it.  No.  And by the way, Boston, Providence.  What's up?  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  O&A Travel and Virus Comedy Show at Mansfield. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  If you have a military ID, you get in for free.  So just come.  What time are people getting in?  Do we know what time the doors are opening?  Because I know there's a whole O&A village and there's a lot of stuff going on.  I don't know because we got a call from that guy yesterday, a true pest of the O&A show.  Maybe he could call in again with all the tailgating info because they're tailgating.  Then the O&A village, which this looks like the best O&A village so far on the tour.  And then you got your three-hour comedy show.  It's an all-day event.  And the score in Providence, we're on the score, of course, is busing 100 listeners to the Mansfield Tweeter Center for the O&A Traveling Virus Show. 
[00:50:30]  And they're having a tailgate barbecue party in the parking lot.  Make sure you check them out and support the score for us.  And I guess we're going to drop by and say hi to everyone over there.  Hang out and party with the score tomorrow before the big show, okay?  Right.  And we're going to debut a brand-new video of our own Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with something you find in your yard.  It's going to get a hell of a reaction at the show tomorrow night. 
[00:51:00]  So we'll see you all in Mansfield tomorrow, all right?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, Brother Elmo's in the studio, by the way.  Yes.  He's joining us in Boston for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show in Mansfield.  Brother Elmo.  Elmo.  Elmo.  So we got a lot going on today.  We got Mike Rowe coming in in about 20 minutes from Dirty Jobs.  Can't wait to talk to him.  He's a great friend of the show. 
[00:51:30]  Also, the gang from The Simpsons at 815 talking about The Simpsons movie.  I'm not sure who we got.  I hear we got all the big wigs from The Simpsons.  So that's going to be really cool.  Actually, big wigs.  I said big wigs.  Yeah.  But I'm picturing giant wigs coming in.  How would we talk to them?  Much of them with Dolly Parton hair.  Yes.  Yeah.  Big wigs.  We're in the middle of talking about, I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  Chuck and Larry.  Oh, my God.  This will be the number one movie at the box office over the weekend. 
[00:52:00]  How funny does this look?  Oh, my God.  If this is number one at the box office, I know.  You know something?  I won't even be surprised.  I'm sure it will be.  It'll be up there, even though it's getting horrific reviews.  Even Kevin James, you know, he's a good actor.  We all know that.  And he's a very funny guy.  He sounds like he's not even into this movie in the preview.  Yeah.  It's just this.  His acting is like, oh, my God.  I can't act this out. 
[00:52:30]  This is stupid.  But how much money am I making?  All right.  Let's go.  And Adam Sandler just bomb after bomb.  Want to try to get through the preview?  And then we're going to go back to Gus and Elmer.  Ah, Gus and Elmer.  We got a little idea as far as Gus and Elmer goes.  We love Gus and Elmer.  Thank you to whoever that person was.  Was it Sam's camera on instant feedback?  Yeah.  Thank you for bringing up Gus and Elmer again.  We love these guys.  Forgot about them.  On July 20th.  Here it is.  You may kiss the husband.  You and Adam are more sexicals? 
[00:53:00]  Mr. Valentine, I'd like to talk to you about your domestic partnership.  Oh, jeez.  Jeez.  Your domestic partnership is being challenged by this thing.  You're a legitimate couple, right?  I used to wrestle in high school, and I loved it.  Adam Sandler.  That lady thinks you're gay.  You can't touch her.  The greatest body I've ever seen, besides Larry's.  These are real, by the way.  Feel.  Yucky.  Kevin James.  Are you a fan of this peach?  Look, there's a girls.  Gross.  You gotta make this place look more gay. 
[00:53:30]  What do you got?  Maxi pants.  We're gay, not transsexuals.  Chuck and Larry.  16 women claim to have slept with you over the last year and a half.  Just for the record, I thought this was a man when I was with her.  This film is not yet ready.  It starts July 20th.  Okay.  Terrific.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And I'm keeping track, by the way.  Another bomb for Adam Sandler.  He continues to make movies in Hollywood.  Has he had some bad bombs?  I don't know.  Name the last good movie Adam Sandler did. 
[00:54:00]  Spanglish.  Oh, my God.  You named it.  Spanish or English?  We don't know.  She'd been called crit.  Who didn't see this coming?  The structure for this movie, the standard broad setup for predictable gags.  And this is from Kyle Smith.  One star.  He gives it in the post.  Yeah.  It says, leading to obvious tolerance lesson at the end.  Oh, yeah.  Can't you just make a funny movie without some dumb message at the end? 
[00:54:30]  Caddyshack didn't have a dumb message at the end.  And we got to get into that maybe next week.  They're remaking Caddyshack.  Has anyone noticed this yet?  No.  Who's your caddy?  Thank you, man.  Are you kidding?  They weren't brave enough to call it Caddyshack, because Caddyshack is one of the funniest  comedies of all time.  It's a black version of Caddyshack.  No.  Who's your caddy?  Of course.  Like, who's your daddy?  Of course.  And it has the Dangerfield character and the Bill Murray character and kind of the Chevy 
[00:55:00]  Chase.  Is Cedric the Entertainer in it?  No, it's a different...  I'm sure Queen Latifah's in it somehow.  Oh, I bet she plays...  Cassie thing?  Right.  Is this on anyone's radar yet?  They are remaking Caddyshack, but they're not brave enough to say it's Caddyshack.  Is it the black version, though?  You said the black version?  It's...  The commercials have just started hitting TV.  It's called Who's Your Caddy?  If it's Who's Your Caddy, then it's got to be the black version.  Except the villain's still white.  White.  Well, please.  Well, we are the guy.  Is it Mr. Smedley? 
[00:55:30]  Or some other awful black film thing?  Look, there's the poster.  The poster even kind of looks like the old Caddyshack poster.  Oh, my God.  Let me see who's in this.  Stop already.  Who's in it?  Oh.  The Rondi Dangerfield character is Big Boy from Outkast, Sam tells me.  Oh, my God.  And here's the synopsis.  Stop.  A hilarious fish-out-of-water comedy about superstar rap mogul C-Note, Big Boy,  who runs into fierce opposition when he tries to join the super-stuffy Carolina Pines Golf and Country Club. 
[00:56:00]  Bushwood.  Undeterred, C-Note gets the brilliant idea to buy the land adjacent to the golf club's 17th hole,  which he cleverly leverages to gain membership.  C-Note's crew wreaks havoc as they bring their larger-than-lifestyle to the club.  Does this sound familiar to anybody?  As the club's hoity-toity leadership desperately tries to revoke C-Note's membership,  our hero realizes that his family's honor and secret record-breaking golf history is at stake. 
[00:56:30]  Ew.  As he takes on the fight of his life, C-Note pulls out all the stops to bring down the club's backwards establishment  and welcome them to the 21st century.  This is Caddyshack.  Why did they just call it Caddyshack?  And the whole thing is settled by a golf match, which might be...  Of course.  It's Caddyshack, but they're not brave enough to say that it's Caddyshack.  A lot of golfers. 
[00:57:00]  That's terrible.  This calls for the old Billy Barul.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  There's f***ing hot Bushwood.  They want to take the golf course, Billy.  No, s***, please.  I got it from a Negro.  Yeah, well.  Does anybody remember last year?  It happened there.  What?  That was my speech. 
[00:57:30]  We're cakes for nothing.  That's right.  Here's what I tell the black people.  How would you like to mow my lawn, huh?  Huh?  Huh?  That would fit.  Does he pull an Escalade up on the golf course?  And they even have the Caddyshack.  It looks like by the pool, just like in the original Caddyshack.  I'm looking at the...  Only they're wilding, pulling off bikinis.  I'm looking at the preview.  It's very, very similar to the original movie. 
[00:58:00]  You tell Ty.  There's a line there, Rodney.  You tell.  Yeah, tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  You tell.  Literally.  Yes.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  Yeah.  But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Hit the **** on the head with the bottles.  Let's say hi to Max.  Max, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, what's up?  Happy belated birthday, sweet boy.  Thank you, man.  I heard one of the lines in that movie was, you'll get a watermelon and like it.  Oh, boy.  It always has to go into the gutter. 
[00:59:00]  Into the gutter.  What's up with you, Max?  Hey.  Hey.  They want to remake a movie with all black people in it, then Max should allow to be the Dallas  racist he is.  There you go.  And he is racist.  All right.  Well, that's on our radar.  So we'll pay close attention to that for everything.  Oh, certainly will now.  I can't believe you haven't seen the commercial there, Anthony.  Who's your caddy?  It's a black version of Caddyshack.  It's as simple as that.  And they did such a terrific job with the black version of the Honeymooners.  Why not?  Why not remake Caddyshack as well while you're at it? 
[00:59:30]  Take the classics and just twist them around.  All right.  So back to I pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  Chuck and Larry.  What do you got in the paper?  It said, the movie operates on the intelligence level of every Cretan meathead in the 516  area code.  That's a little local humor.  Yeah.  That's 516 in Suffolk County out there on Long Island.  But the guy insults an entire county.  Yes.  Snarky douche writer.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Just how the dummies don't intellectually see it like he does.  Long Island's all stupid, but he's a brilliant, socially insightful guy. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  And he writes, I quote his article here, lots of queer gags involving the  involving ass and bitch, a gay mailman who would be happy, quote, coming in through  the back door.  That's one of the jokes.  And a guy who drops the soap in a group shower just to make it extra funny.  A second guy then drops his soap. 
[01:00:30]  Yikes.  And then they bring up the Rob Schneider doing Japanese shtick mop haircut, thrust out teeth,  huge, goofy glasses, may I happy you accent.  That was already dying when Mickey Rooney did it in Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Did it?  How about that?  Adam Sandler sitting in a kid-sized chair and breaking it.  Ew.  Sandler sitting in a kid-sized chair again and breaking it.  And now for the one-liners.  If these men are gay, then I'm a one-legged parrot. 
[01:01:00]  Says Firehouse boss Dan Aykroyd.  Oh, Dan Aykroyd's in this movie?  Why wouldn't he be?  Skip it.  He also says, quote, your asses will be busier than a test bench at a plunger factory.  Wait, your what?  Your asses will be busier than a test bench at a plunger factory, is one of the lines  in the movie, and I don't even know what that means. 
[01:01:30]  What a test bench?  Bench.  There's no test bench at a plunger factory?  No.  I've worked at a plunger factory.  I've never seen a test bench.  Thank you, Anthony.  I've never worked at a plunger factory.  And this gem.  Yeah.  Sandler offers up, I'm Wolfgang Puck to his Wolfgang Suck.  Sandler offers up, I'm Wolfgang Suck.  Does this just sound horrific? 
[01:02:00]  Yikes.  Yeah.  Are you done?  I want to go back to Elmer and Gus.  I'm completely done.  What?  Well, Elmer and Gus.  Are you a gay couple?  Well, now they're up to 59 years together.  This is the update on Elmer and Gus.  Leave gay to the young.  And one of them is 89, and one is 84.  No, 85 now.  85 or 86.  What were they hiding from back then, though?  Like, no one knew anyone was gay back then.  No one knew. 
[01:02:30]  Even like Rock Hudson went how many years before anyone even figured out he was gay?  Right.  Well, no one knows people are gay.  They just think they're friends.  If they've been together 59 years, that brings us to what?  1948-ish?  Dude.  Right?  1948, you're hiding your gay?  You're hiding your gayness.  No one would notice.  They would look at it like all pleasant.  Oh, no one would.  Oh, I got it.  I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  They wouldn't, like, accuse them of being gay.  They would just think that's what they do. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, why don't we cue the music, and why don't we go through the years with Gus and Elmer?  It's just a wonderful thing.  The Gus and Elmer, sorry.  Fresh from back from the war.  Gus and Elmer move into a new Levitt home in Levittown.  One of these wonderful one-bedroom homes.  I guess just to save money.  They're living together.  Split the bills.  Those two are inseparable. 
[01:03:30]  They seem to do everything together.  Splitting the bills.  And boy, are they friendly with the neighbors.  The neighbors seem to love them.  Their house is impeccable.  And decorated to the nines.  If that's even a term back then.  To the nines.  No one is raising an eyebrow.  Whatsoever.  What?  This is the first I've ever heard them call curtains window treatments.  What does that even mean?  For Gus and Elmer, it means lots of color. 
[01:04:00]  And a gay atmosphere in the house.  You know, happy.  That's right.  Gay meant happy back in the 40s, late 40s.  Then they moved to Queens for a while.  Well, just seem to like the name of that town, I guess.  But that was short-lived because they soon moved to San Francisco.  Oh, boy.  Ah. 
[01:04:30]  Yes, here they are in Frisco.  In the 60s.  The 60s in Frisco.  Oh, damn.  What happened to the 50s?  Yeah, well, I was hoping you, uh...  Wait a minute.  They don't leave New York yet.  All right.  Let's go back.  All right.  Let's go back to the 40s music.  Look.  It's off the cuff.  Okay.  Other radio guys do this when they're off the air.  We like to do it live.  All right.  So...  Here they are at a dance.  They're a couple of wallflowers.  They don't seem to be dancing with any girls. 
[01:05:00]  You want to go into the 50s now?  Ah, a new decade for Gus and Elma.  There you go.  The 50s.  There you go.  Oh, blue moon.  Why are they arguing?  Who is this moon gentleman?  Are you cheating on me?  I don't even know what that means.  But they do seem very happy together.  No, no, Elma. 
[01:05:30]  It's a sock pop.  Yes, the 50s.  They sure did enjoy it.  But that quickly turned to the turbulent 60s.  Ah, yeah.  Well, I believe now they pack up the old car.  And head out to San Francisco.  And head out to San Francisco.  Uh, Mr. Voice Guy, there seems to be a lot more Gus and Elmer's in San Francisco. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Any suspicion yet?  They sure are getting along with everybody.  Cleanliness is next to godliness.  They seem to visit a bathhouse every day.  Yes, flowers in your hair.  But what's that in your mouth, Gus?  Wow, what queer fashions they wear. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  Well, I'm talking about the time.  You know, queer means unusual.  Not what it's going to mean in the future.  Space travel.  Of course.  Any suspicion yet, Mr. Voice Guy?  Suspicion of what?  These two gentlemen get along lovely.  Especially with all the folks in San Francisco.  Joining the flower generation.  The flower people.  Yeah.  Flower power.  And again, they're sharing an apartment.  They sure are economical. 
[01:07:00]  What's up with the tie-dyed shirts, though, Mr. Voice Guy?  Well, they seem to like that.  But neither of them, and it might be because of the war, can seem to hold down a relationship with a woman.  They're always seen together, out at the same bars.  You know, the ramrod around the corner.  Or the mineshaft.  Not many ladies at those bars.  I'm a little worried they won't settle down and make a family for themselves. 
[01:07:30]  They should go to more dances.  Well, and then we move into...  They sure are groovy.  We're going to move into the 70s now.  And for some reason, Gus and Elmer have decided to pack their bags and move to New York City.  Back to New York.  In the 70s.  For Gus and Elmer.  Yes.  They are getting a bit older.  And their skin must be drying out because what I see is a lot of lubricants around their apartment. 
[01:08:00]  Here in the city.  Again, trying to find love with the ladies, but no luck at all.  At this place called Studio 54.  They sure aren't dancing a lot.  That keeps them in shape.  And I guess the club is hot because they're shirtless.  I don't understand.  They don't seem to be equestrians, yet they wear traps. 
[01:08:30]  And you couldn't wear that on a horse.  That could make you shape a bit.  Ah.  One of them is suggesting a song.  ABBA's Dancing Queen.  Through History.  With Gus and Elmer.  There they go.  Yeah.  You can dance.  Having the time of your life. 
[01:09:00]  Is the word gay gay yet?  Yeah.  Because they're having a gay time.  Oh, boy.  They're still having a gay time.  Oh, okay.  Let's say they're happy.  Yeah.  Married.  Married.  But the situation is a bit queer.  To me.  That's good.  Oh, little did they see that happening in the 70s.  I was all innocent.  It seems to have snuck in there.  Oh, so tiny.  So small an organism. 
[01:09:30]  Yikes.  That will cause some problems in the future.  Yes.  Oh, you know, it's the end of the 70s and quite the backlash.  Everyone's saying, disco sucks.  Disco sucks.  And so does Gus.  Ah.  After that little bacteria virus gets in there.  Stayin' alive takes on a whole new meaning. 
[01:10:00]  Well, we're into the 80s there, Mr. Voice Guy.  Oh, look how old Gus and Elma are getting.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Not much whamming going on at the old Gus and Elma house.  They're settling down now.  Usually you can find them dressed in a robe, drinking broth, and petting their little Yorkshire  terrier.  These two bachelors are still on the prowl for ladies. 
[01:10:30]  You're still buying into that, Mr. Voice Guy?  Of course I am.  Why am I still from the 40s?  I got another song for you there, Mr. Voice Guy.  A little Tainted Love.  Tainted Love.  Yeah, well.  What an appropriate song.  Yes.  Gus and Elma sure do love their cock.  Oops.  Gus.  I got for the new technology called a dump button. 
[01:11:00]  Right, well.  That's what Gus calls it.  The dump button.  A little Tainted Love.  And now as we enter the 90s, oh, we see Gus and Elma, barely a mere shell of their former  selves.  Well, they must have a nice gym membership.  They're keeping in shape there.  They might be going to the gym a little too much. 
[01:11:30]  No?  What?  Gus seems to be too sexy for his depend undercomments.  Because he's running around the house, nude.  Too sexy for my shit.  I took my shit on my shit.  So sexy.  Yes.  Gus is too sexy for this hospital bed.  Too sexy for this hospital bed.  Now let's look far into the future.  Oh, boy.  Past where they are now.  Yeah.  Who is that?  Gus, I see? 
[01:12:00]  Kneeling by a tombstone.  Oh, you had to go there.  Oh.  Look, his knees, they're so skinny and thin, they're sinking into the mud over the grave.  Poor Gus.  Poor Elma.  But they led a good life.  Maybe all they needed was a woman to settle down with.  Philadelphia.  As they move back to Philadelphia. 
[01:12:30]  Two men dedicated to each other.  For almost 60 years.  Yes.  The story of Gus and Elmer.  What an odd decorating technique in the houses.  Why are the bar stores upside down?  Do we have a message here, Mr. Voice Guy?  Yes, there's always a message.  Yeah.  In the end, what's the message as far as Gus and Elmer go?  Get a girl or wear a bag. 
[01:13:00]  Gus and Elmer, always riding bareback.  Boy, this ends depressing.  Yeah, no kidding.  We're having fun.  What the hell, man?  Well, it always does, doesn't it?  We're having a little fun there.  With somebody having to take care of the dog.  Poor confused little dog.  Used to two laps.  Jump in.  Only has one.  Hey, if you want to join... 
[01:13:30]  Just one uncomfortable bony lap.  If you want to join Sam in San Diego for Comic-Con, courtesy of our good friends at NBC,  you go out there, you get a sneak peek at NBC's new fall shows, Bionic Woman and Chuck,  and see the cast and crew of Heroes, talk about their new season, and see the latest sci-fi screenings.  You can log on to 923krock.com to enter for the trip to San Diego with our own Sam.  Always very helpful at the bars that they're in.  Always willing to push in a friend's stool. 
[01:14:00]  That old gag.  Yes.  And with that, we step aside.  I think Mike Rowe joins the program next.  Is he here?  Cool.  Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  Talk about Dirty Job.  Look what Gus is doing to Elmer.  That'll take some awashing.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're back.  It's Opie and Anthony, one of our favorite people in studio, Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs. 
[01:14:30]  You're too kind.  Oh.  And the world's deadliest catch, of course.  Naturally.  With the rogue waves and...  Deadliest catch.  Yeah, he narrates.  And I saw you hosting like a best of type of thing where they sat around and chatted about some circumstances.  That was very cool.  You know, I mean, you don't really know what to do with a show that centers around pots coming up either being full or empty. 
[01:15:00]  You know, I mean, people...  I mean, it's a huge hit.  People can't get enough of it.  But we're like, you know, what can we do to kind of bring it, you know, get it a little deeper?  And the answer was basically, you know, people are digging the stories.  And the captains are real people.  So we just figured, let's...  There are two places you're going to find a captain of a crab boat, in the wheelhouse or in a bar.  So we thought, you know what?  Enough of the wheelhouse already.  Let's just go to a bar and sit down with four of these guys and have a few rounds and let's hear some stories.  They're such unique people.  These guys are such unique people. 
[01:15:30]  Like, they're just...  They're exactly what they are.  They're crab boat captains.  Yeah.  And I can't see them doing anything else and neither can they.  And the stories they got were telling about, like, the waves that just go over the bridge.  Yeah.  And one story about the ship just about capsizing and then coming back over.  Just came back.  Had that boat been stacked with pots.  Yeah.  The way they are 50% of the time.  Done.  Yeah.  Done.  Just like that.  They talk about it and they had some video. 
[01:16:00]  And, I mean, these guys are talking about being below and just ending up on the ceiling.  Oh, yeah.  And going, all right.  You know, you're dead.  What are you going to do?  You got to think they got great lives, though.  Instead of...  I'm serious.  It's adventurous.  Instead of putting on a suit every day and doing the same thing.  Their lives are exciting.  They might not live too long, but what a ride they got.  They're putting on a suit.  It's just big and puffy and orange and floatable.  Yeah.  It ain't that stylish.  Speaking of that, a couple of deaths this year. 
[01:16:30]  I was watching that.  A ship went down.  They sent out the Coast Guard and they found, like, a suit, one of the suits floating that  they thought was a person.  But unless you get in those survival suits...  Two minutes.  ...you're done in two minutes.  Two to four.  Yeah.  Two to four minutes in that cold water.  You're done.  And, you know, then they showed him pulling a body up.  And then the reaction of the other guys is really amazing. 
[01:17:00]  Because you'll get the captains and the crew members talking about how they feel about  the ship going down and them doing the same thing and knowing that that could happen to  them at any moment.  And then, boom, it's back to work.  Next.  Next.  Come on.  Lay down some pots or pull up some pots.  It's time to get back to work.  Yeah.  Ant was saying before the show today that he doesn't understand why you're doing the  things you're doing lately.  Well, you on the...  That's dirty jobs.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just taking it to the dirty jobs discussion because you've been freaked out all morning 
[01:17:30]  about some of this stuff.  Me and my chick are watching a marathon and I'm just going, why?  Why?  We sit there and yell at you on TV going, stop it.  You were doing something.  It was at a charcoal plant.  This charcoal thing.  And you know what it is?  It's these mom and pop businesses that are the worst places because there's no OSHA guy  walking around making sure that the safety is all in place. 
[01:18:00]  So you go there and there's this father-son operation.  And the job is charcoal.  Making charcoal.  Not like briquettes.  That's part of their job.  They ship some stuff off to briquettes made.  But what is the charcoal actually used for?  Well, this is lump charcoal.  You can buy it under 50 different brands.  They sell it around the world.  This is in the Ozarks and these guys do it right.  And basically picture, I don't know, 15 very small airplane hangers side to side. 
[01:18:30]  These are ovens and they take the used lumber from a nearby lumber yard that's too screwed  up to actually get turned into a coffee table or a credenza and they burn it.  They actually don't burn it.  They char it, which means it's hot enough to smolder.  And then they just let it cook in these horrible little rooms for days.  And then when it's completely black and charred straight through, they go in with a front  end loader and their bare hands and hatchets and mallets and they smash it to pieces. 
[01:19:00]  And each time you crack a little tiny piece of this wood, there is a commensurate explosion  of dust that is essentially a small nuclear reaction.  So within seconds, you are covered with the stickiest, vilest, blackest material there  is.  And that's at seven in the morning.  By seven at night, you know, it just looks like something out of your worst nightmare.  Yeah.  And it's six days in a row.  And you are, you know, I'm watching going, he's not wearing a mask. 
[01:19:30]  He's not wearing a goddamn mask.  It's natural, Mac.  It won't hurt you.  Yeah, that's what they were saying.  It's natural.  I'm like, dude, so is lightning.  You're breathing this in.  So is a shark attack.  But you're buying into it because you're there without the mask.  Like, all right.  Yeah, but I'm leaving at the end of the day, dude.  I want to know how your lungs are doing.  My lungs are okay.  I got them checked out.  All right, good.  Good.  I mean, look, in all seriousness, their point is, listen, you know, five generations of  this, you know, they all live into their 90s, to which I argue, well, you've developed 
[01:20:00]  an immunity for God's sake.  Yeah, no, true.  I mean, but, you know, for one day, I can, my philosophy, as you guys know, is you show  up, suck it up, cross it off the list, and move on.  Your crew did not look happy.  My crew.  And they were filthy.  Normally, at the end of these gigs, you know, we will find the nearest bar and have a beer  and sit down and dissect the day.  After that one, we all just kind of looked at each other, and nobody spoke for about  five seconds, and I said, I'll see you guys around.  Yeah, I'll get out of here.  Your cameraman is used to getting a lot of gack on him, because he gets these undershots. 
[01:20:30]  He gets some great shots, but it's usually some type of crap pouring on top of him.  Finally, and justifiably, nominated for an Emmy.  Really?  Yesterday.  Dirty Gosh.  Bravo!  Thank you.  No, these guys, these guys earn it.  But now, there was a young lady with, you know, the clipboard and the headset that I  normally see on sets that are impeccably clean, and she was dirty and did not look happy. 
[01:21:00]  No.  No, we lost her that night.  Yeah, we no longer have that role on the show.  Anything that you can write on a clipboard during the process of shooting a dirty job  is simply not that important.  Yeah.  We've eliminated the position.  Yeah.  Okay.  There, another one I was watching was the barrier that comes up.  God, hurricane.  A hurricane barrier. 
[01:21:30]  Not far from here, Stamford, Connecticut.  Yeah, Stamford, Connecticut.  This is a four-and-a-half-story piece of hollow steel that lies flat most of the time on the  mud underneath the water.  And when tidal surges come in towards Stamford, it stands up straight like the cover of a book  if you open it.  Who knew?  Who knew, right?  Well, inside this horrible piece of Kafka-esque iron are about 500 small steel rooms, tiny.  And they're like the honeycomb, right, in a beehive. 
[01:22:00]  And they're all filled with dead marine life and rotten methane-rich mud, which needs to  be removed once a year.  And these people crawl headfirst down into this thing.  These people.  You did.  Yes, well, I left at the end of the day.  But, yeah, that was a good day.  And, you know, it's a great dirty job because, like Opie said, who knew?  Right.  And if it's not done, you know, the next tidal surge comes up the harbor.  That thing's going to snap like a twig and Stamford's gone.  What did it smell like?  Not good.  Not good.  It smelled like the hold in a crab boat on catch, essentially, that had never been cleaned. 
[01:22:30]  Who knew also that, like, something as innocent as church bells, there was anything disgusting  as far as bells go?  Who knew?  Bells, made the old-fashioned way, have a key ingredient.  The ingredient's crap.  It's horse crap.  It's a natural binder that holds the elements of bronze and copper together.  So, to make a bell, you go get horse poo. 
[01:23:00]  You smack the poo together with the thing, and then you pour it, and then it's hot,  and then you can't believe you've done this, and it's 9 o'clock.  And then you have to lug the thing nine stories up to hang it in a bell-free.  But you have to replace the bell that was in there before you put the new one in.  The bell that's been in there is completely covered with pigeon crap.  Dead pigeons are everywhere.  It's 150 degrees.  It's in Baltimore.  You hate bells after a day like that.  And one of the funniest things, and I'm sure it was great for you,  so he's in the bell trying to change something that runs the clapper, 
[01:23:30]  a solenoid or some kind of gadgetry that was in there.  And you hear a far-off bell going off.  And the guy that's with Mike goes,  Oh, yeah, that's one of ours.  And he tells the address of the church and everything.  And then out of nowhere,  BONG!  The bell that Mike's in starts ringing.  And your face, you're trying so hard to cover your ears.  But it looks like even with your hands over your ears, it's doing nothing.  You're inside a bell. 
[01:24:00]  And then the guy realizes what was happening.  At 6 o'clock, all the bells ring.  Oh, boy.  And it should have been a warning.  And Mike goes,  Wouldn't that have been a warning that the bell just rang?  You're a bell maker.  He goes,  Oh, I was kind of distracted.  You know, it's one of our bells.  He's proud to hear it ring,  so he forgot to say maybe,  Hey, Mike, get the hell out of the bell.  It's going to go off in a couple of seconds.  So how's your hearing?  What?  The lungs are good.  The hearing's a little rough, right?  Every part of him is just getting destroyed on these shows.  My father has called 2007 a revolving door of perpetual infirmary. 
[01:24:30]  He's not far off the mark.  Hey, because of you, we tried, what was it, Gooey Duck?  Ah, how'd that go?  Oh, the Gooey Duck.  Is it called Gooey Duck?  I think we did a boiled meat barbecue for 4th of July.  We weren't allowed to have open flame here.  So we figured we'd just get barbecue-type stuff and horrific food and then boil it.  Just boil it and try it out.  Because that's just as good as over a nice flame broiled...  Boiled clam. 
[01:25:00]  And when you tried the Gooey Duck on Dirty Jobs, it seemed to enjoy it.  Well, our guys didn't enjoy it like you did, man.  Well, I hadn't eaten for three days, so that was a bad test.  It was to you, King.  Yeah, the Gooey Duck thing probably generated more mail than any segment that year.  This is basically giant clam, you know, and they're shaped conspicuously like a horse's penis.  A big one.  And they, you know, they grow in the sand.  And whenever you pull something that phallic out of the wet dirt on national TV, it, if 
[01:25:30]  you're, well, Anthony, you know, if you're just flicking by there in your underpants on  a rainy Saturday, and you see something like this, it's both horrifying and humbling.  Yeah, you gotta stop.  And you gotta stop.  You gotta stop.  You're not going by that one.  Where's the rest of the creature?  This thing was...  What the hell is that?  Right.  Especially when you recognize the mud hole.  I know, Mark.  Hey, how many times have you puked because of Dirty Jobs?  Probably four.  Twice on camera. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I saw that one, too.  That was a good one.  Wait, which one?  Well, I don't get seasick, but on the back of a shark boat a couple years ago, early on,  we were in Martha's Vineyard.  I was with a shark biologist, and we were basically catching dogfish about five miles  off the coast.  The night before had been defined primarily by no sleep and a bottle of warm gin, and  the following morning began well before dawn.  So I'm not, you know, on my best legs out there.  We're in a following sea, which is, you know, five foot swells behind the boat pushing you 
[01:26:30]  against a slack tide, and that's not good.  And I got a meat grinder, and I got two buckets of dead mackerel.  So basically, for a few hours, I'm turning dead mackerel into liquid dead mackerel, making  chum.  Chum, sure.  It just caught up to me.  And it was a colossal vomit.  I mean, I can't imitate.  It was so onerous that Discovery actually blurred it.  Yeah, yeah.  So it looks like...  Why do they blur a puke?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because my bile, Opie, is simply too disgusting. 
[01:27:00]  Like the rest of the things you're doing on this show isn't heinous enough.  But that's their line, you know, blurring out the mic.  Mike's throwing up.  Come on.  His power boot.  Well, Mike, could it be...  It was too sexy for them.  Could it be that they didn't want their host to be seen vomiting pure alcohol?  It was like, anyone's called Juniper?  That's clear.  Wait a minute.  That's vodka.  What the heck?  A label and a tequila worm.  How much are we paying him?  I don't know.  And then the other times? 
[01:27:30]  A grease pit outside of Madison.  Oh, yeah.  A guy named Wes Swanson.  Last time on the show you talked about the grease pit and the smell.  Yeah.  Well, we'd spent the morning in a septic tank and that kind of laid the foundation.  And then I thought I'd seen the worst of it.  But Les had me sort of by my feet and I was upside down in a manhole outside of an elementary school.  And there was something about it.  It was the fact that I knew the grease and the poo had come from eight-year-olds.  And it just hit me in a way and in a spot that I wasn't really prepared for. 
[01:28:00]  It's like a kidney shot.  Yeah.  You just don't expect it.  And the sheer volume of it.  I mean, it's literally, it's like a 3,000 square foot room about five feet deep in fluid that really shouldn't exist.  And you go in it and it's off-putting.  I saw you at the waste water treatment plant also.  Good times.  And that was a good one.  And where they kept running out.  Like, oh, we're getting the gas over here.  The alarm keeps going off.  Yeah, the alarm kept going off.  It's like, oh, that's hydrogen sulfide. 
[01:28:30]  You're going to leave on that one.  Oh, there goes the sodium.  Might want to back off.  And it's like this ridiculously small part per million will do you in.  And the alarm kept going off and the guys are running.  And then you're finally back.  Hey, is it safe?  Well, I guess so.  Go ahead.  Start shoveling or trying to open the door against.  Yeah.  That kind of got me, too.  Like, why did the door open in that direction against the crap and whatnot?  Because if it opens the other way and it's too much pressure behind it, it'll blow you back to God. 
[01:29:00]  Back to God.  That would be a hell of a last thing to have going through your mind.  Whatever happened to Mike?  Yeah.  Airtight door took him out.  It was bad.  He went back to God.  Open casket?  No, no, no.  Not so much.  Hey, we got a surprise for Mike.  We said last time you were here we were going to have a surprise for you the next time.  Oh, okay.  Surprise.  A little audio you need to listen to.  Oh, crap.  So a guy walks into a bar.  Remember the unknown comic? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  This is YouTube, isn't it?  If I were a cat, I would be loving this because cats love that sound.  Pretty cool.  That sound makes cats just crazy.  They just love it.  That's why this is a cat toy.  That's a cat on the front.  And when the cat sees this, he's going to be drawn to it magically.  He's going to crawl in the bag.  And he'll just roll around and sort of wrestle with the bag. 
[01:30:00]  And just really experience a singular cat thrill.  You are killing me.  Oh, what the hell was that?  It's Mike Rowe from QVC 1992.  Wow.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  We found some audio.  Mike Rowe from 1992.  You're selling the cat sack.  The cat sack?  It's basically a $36 bag that a cat can crawl into. 
[01:30:30]  Well, I'll be honest with you.  All right, Mike.  I saw this a few nights ago on YouTube, and I have no conscious recollection of this happening.  But, you know, I spent three years at QVC on a kind of double-secret probation, was fired a couple of times,  and essentially, you know, worked the midnight shift and made fun of whatever product they gave me and belittled the callers.  But, yeah, the cat sack apparently is the size of a shopping bag with crinkly crap on the inside.  Your cat crawls in and rolls around and is transfixed.  And that's it.  But the guy that posted that, he used to be the editor. 
[01:31:00]  Is that now?  Worse.  I think he's writing for Futurama or something.  Seriously, he used to be the editor at The Onion.  Now, I didn't learn this until eight years after the fact, but there used to be a comic strip called The Endless Nights of Rick Nobles.  It was based on clips like that.  Then these guys used to tape my shift at QVC and play it during the Onion staff meeting to create the proper air of irreverence and subversion. 
[01:31:30]  And they were watching the first night I got fired, actually.  And at good times, yeah.  Thanks for that, Opie.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a cat bag.  Right, right, right.  It's a cat bag with a Maguire rookie card.  We're going to throw in a twist tie and a rubber band.  Your cat's going to love it, people.  Be dialing.  Put it on FlexPay.  What were you doing in 1989?  I want to hear this.  I was in hot attics.  I was knocking tin.  Hey, Mike, about a month ago, we played the first show Ant and I did together. 
[01:32:00]  It was beyond uncomfortable.  Cringe.  Way more uncomfortable than you feel right now.  Could not sit through it.  It was from 1994.  Yeah, I had to leave the room.  Yeah, it was really uncomfortable.  Speaking with, well, Mike tries to understand why cats like the things they do.  Oh, no.  Not more.  Just one more.  One more.  The guy's our friend, for Christ's sake.  Well, we felt like he is a friend and we should bring it to the next level.  If he's a true friend, this is what we do to our friend.  Thank God I'm not an enemy. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, right.  Cat sack.  Cat toy sack.  He's just laughing.  $36.50.  Yeah, you know, I mean, it's a little bizarre.  All right.  But if you think about most cat toys, they're kind of bizarre.  Cats are kind of bizarre.  You know, big carpeted pillars that they can go up to and scratch.  That's kind of weird.  Little balls with bells inside that they knock around.  That's kind of strange.  If you're a cat, you're entertained by things that normally wouldn't appeal to humans.  And there are not many humans that would crawl into a big crinkly bag just for the fun of it. 
[01:33:00]  But if you're a cat, that's exactly the kind of thing you do.  Because there's not much else I guess you can really do with your time.  You are partial to that crinkly sound.  Look at him.  That's a cat that's having fun.  Look at that cat.  That cat just doesn't know what to do with himself.  Every time he moves, he hears crinkling.  And they just love that crinkling.  No, Mike, this is a tribute to you. 
[01:33:30]  Yes, it absolutely is.  How the hell do you talk about a bag that you're selling for a cat?  God bless you.  You know how?  And you sold it.  Just like that.  You said if you're partial to crinkling sound.  To crinkling.  And then you just got to keep rolling.  Like, hey, cats, they're...  You're predisposed to the sound of crinkling.  Oh, my God.  You can't just stand there and stare blindly into the camera.  So you got to keep selling.  And he's just like...  Mike's just like, yeah, cats, they're weird. 
[01:34:00]  Hey, let me tell you.  They scratch things.  How strange is that?  I love it.  There's another one.  Mike watching a cat playing with the cat sack.  That's the last clip as far as the cat sack goes.  Enough about the cat sack.  I couldn't tell.  And if he's going to hang out, we got to play the clip where they're trying to sell a crappy,  I'll say, karaoke machine by singing Frank Sinatra's My Way.  No way.  Good God, man.  That I haven't seen.  And then he also talks about how he's attracted to the Little Mermaid and Veronica. 
[01:34:30]  Actually, I still kind of am.  Who wouldn't be?  Little Mermaid's cute.  And then the last clip that we might torture you with if you stick around.  Mike's sounding very, very tired.  He's just like, kill me.  So this is basically how you entice me into sticking around.  You know, he's a big star.  I saw him on Larry King the other night.  Mike Rowe is huge.  Taking off, man.  Huge.  My ship has come in.  We do dirty jobs.  Larry King's proctologist. 
[01:35:00]  Turn your head and pray.  So, Mike, do you take garlic?  I take it the hard way.  Why don't you go to the Welch's Grape Juice Factory?  That's got to be dirty.  Everyone's stained.  You know, you can't get those grape stains out.  Cleveland, go.  You're on with Mike Rowe.  You might be saved from the last cat sack clip.  We got the gang from the Simpsons movie here. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, man.  That definitely trumps me.  I'll wait in the car, man.  You're sticking around, right?  I'm going to crawl in my cat sack, dude, and get some shut-eye.  I'm not playing.  I'm not leaving.  You're not leaving us.  Dude, I'm never leaving.  Hey, what are we promoting?  Anything?  No, man.  You're just doing the hang with us?  I'm just hanging.  We love when that happens.  Look how Mike's going at that.  Look how Mike's just playing with it.  Loves that mic sack.  Of course, 30 jobs on the Discovery Channel, Tuesdays at 9 p.m.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:36:00]  Crap, crap.  I'm sorry.  What?  What happened?  150 jobs.  We're celebrating it on Labor Day.  Forgive me, but if I don't do that, the person in the green room will hit me really hard in my larynx.  But it's a big deal.  We castrated some yaks up in Montana.  It's going to be hot.  Nice.  Nice.  Labor Day.  What did you do with them after they were off?  Well, that's the surprise I have for you guys.  All right, cool.  They cut to the San Gennaro Fest where we're eating sausage heroes.  All right, we've got to go to break. 
[01:36:30]  We've got the gang from the Simpsons movie.  We're very excited about that.  Mike Rowe is sticking around, and we've got some great audio to hit him with later on in the program.  The big show tomorrow, Jimmy.  Yeah, we're up in Mansfield.  We're excited.  89 Comedians, our comedy tour.  Tweeter Center, tomorrow night we're all heading up.  What time is the show?  Like, 7 o'clock?  I should probably have this.  7 o'clock, but I mean, they're going to do tailgating way before that in the O&A Village,  and it's going to be unbelievable.  And we're very excited.  We're leaving right after the show for Mansfield.  And Rick Shapiro is doing a spot on the show. 
[01:37:00]  I think that Carlos is not on the show.  Yeah, I don't know what that's about.  I think he's shooting, actually, so he will not be on the show.  People?  Yes.  It's still going to be a great show.  Yes, we know.  50 things I just rifled through.  Dumped, dumped, dumped, dumped.  Dumped, dumped, fired.  Yeah.  Military ID.  That's the info when you get out.  Yeah, you get it for free if you have a military ID.  All you got to just do is show it.  And we're all wimps.  So even if you forget your ID, just say I'm in the military, and we'll probably just go  on.  All right, go ahead.  It's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  More with Mike Rowe, the gang from The Simpsons movie. 
[01:37:30]  Just lots going on today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's getting crowded in here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Mike Rowe's still hanging out.  Good friend of the show.  And then Anthony, I hear you introducing Mike Rowe to The Simpsons guys here, and I don't  know if Mike appreciated that.  Well, no, he was very cordial.  He got up and introduced himself, and I said, that's Mike Rowe.  He goes into sewers and then puts it on TV.  That's fine.  Got you.  I didn't want to make your show sound anything less than it was, but I wanted to sum it up 
[01:38:00]  quickly.  Well, I've been talking to Discovery, and we've agreed unanimously that if you could  come and handle all the promos from this point on, you have a natural proclivity for  it.  People these days need quick sound bites, quick hits.  Mike Rowe in a sewer.  It's on TV.  Discovery.  There you go.  There it is.  That's all you need.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Beats cat bag.  It's a cat sack.  Cat sack.  Get it.  We'll get back into that a little later. 
[01:38:30]  What's up, guys?  Look who we got here.  Where do we begin?  Well, we have to introduce everybody.  We have James Brooks, Al Jean, David Sherman, Mike Scully, and I think that's it.  Am I correct?  Who's David Sherman?  Silverman.  Oh, that's it.  That's me.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  He's a stand-up comic.  Don't fault him.  Oh, it was spelled Sherman.  Oh, I'll change my name.  Just change it.  My name's David Sherman.  Just change it.  David Silverman.  I'm a anti-Semitism. 
[01:39:00]  That's good.  Yeah, right?  What?  Jesus.  All right, so you're doing a movie of The Sampsons.  I'll have to change that, too.  Terrible, Jimmy.  All right, so my apologies.  Yeah, this has been...  Actually, the Simpsons movie, rumors of it were going on for years.  How long have you guys been working on this?  A couple weeks.  Just a couple weeks?  Got it going.  Wow, that was quick.  It's a flash.  I'll flash.  Yeah, we got it.  Someone worked that mic over there. 
[01:39:30]  We're one mic short.  How can we be one mic short?  Jesus, it's a radio stage.  We're supposed to be professional over here.  But yeah, there had always been these rumors that it was going to be a movie, and then it  didn't happen.  What finally put it over the top for you?  It said, yeah, this is the time.  Like, 20 years later.  Well, we were always waiting until we had enough writers to do both the show and the movie  simultaneously, and now we have...  Was that it?  Yeah.  Half of them are here in this room today.  And that was it.  And animators as well. 
[01:40:00]  We couldn't do the show and the movie at the same time.  Yeah.  Do you guys outsource the animation?  Does that go to Korea?  We have a sweatshop.  We have a sweatshop.  A sweatshop?  A private sweatshop.  Those things are so economical, man.  You get all the work done, and it doesn't cost you anything, and no one really knows  what's going on in those places.  Those kids are too busy having fun.  Right.  It's cartoons.  How could the kids working on them not like it?  It was a great deal.  We agreed to let them animate the movie, and they agreed to let us inspect their nuclear  sites. 
[01:40:30]  Was that what did it?  I knew they finally shut down the nuclear plant, and I didn't know it was for Simpsons  cells.  But now, of course, the Tracy Ullman Show kicked the whole thing off.  Any inkling back then that...  How many years has it been?  That was 20 years ago.  20 years ago.  That's something that was just kind of a toss-in thing on the Tracy Ullman Show.  It was a network that nobody watched.  It was a network that was black. 
[01:41:00]  We were there at the time.  And we decided to have these little 15, 20-second pieces between our sketches, and one of them  was Matt's The Simpsons.  And that just obviously took off.  And getting back to the whole Fox thing and a young fledgling network that would put anything  on and let it stay on for a while.  Now, it's kind of odd now when you hear a new show turn up on Fox, and then it's gone 
[01:41:30]  in like two weeks.  You go, wow, that was kind of the network that used to give them a little bit of time.  Do you think a show like The Simpsons would have made the cut, or hard to see?  These days, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, just almost these two guys were there at the very beginning.  David was there for The Ullman Show, and he animated the earliest stuff, and now directed  the movie.  And I took the writing job at the beginning because none of my friends wanted it.  I basically said, I'll work hard, and I'll work cheap. 
[01:42:00]  That's just amazing.  It seemed like the focus was originally on Bart Simpson, and then the star became Homer.  When did that happen?  Well, it wasn't conscious.  It was just, we got older and fatter.  A little more relatable?  A lot more relatable to us.  We're heading towards Grandpa.  Yeah.  In terms of our plots.  Yeah, the Homer character definitely changed more, I think, over time than any of the other  characters, and obviously for the better.  The lower his IQ, the funner he became.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the first few, it was like, well, that's a little too smart for Homer. 
[01:42:30]  I don't like this smart Homer.  He was trying too hard to be a good dad, and then we just, ah, nuts to that.  Yeah.  Well, it definitely works.  Is there something you've written, like one of the episodes you've written, like, I mean,  obviously there's a million of them that are hailed as brilliant, but is there one  you write that, like, if I had to just die and have one episode, this would be it?  Well, there's one thing I'm really proud of.  When I was a little kid, I got a valentine that said, I choo-choo-choose you from a girl.  And I thought, wow, she choo-choo-choose me.  That's really sweet.  And so I had Lisa give one to Ralph, and then he blew it up into a crush and, you know, 
[01:43:00]  it wouldn't leave.  And it's on my wedding band.  Oh, really?  And I heard there was another wedding that really happened where they had those vows.  So.  Wow.  Changing lives.  That's amazing.  The 30-year-old valentine's card.  A stuttering joke on your wedding band.  That's great.  They couldn't fit two Jews walking to a bar.  Makes the band a lot more expensive.  All mixing shoes.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  What's the basic storyline of the movie?  We don't.  Do we say now?  I mean, is it close enough to say?  Do you?  Or no?  Oh, yeah.  You got to say.  It's secret.  Well, it's basically.  Homer works in the sewers.  And it's on TV.  It's going to be great.  It's not that far off.  Dealing with pig waste is a big issue in the film.  Ah, okay.  And Homer's.  As it is in real life.  Sure.  Homer's poor solution to the problem is what really causes the plot of the movie to kick  in, and then he has to save the day. 
[01:44:00]  But it's really, you know, much more elegantly and sophisticated than the basic.  Well, not that much.  I always liked about The Simpsons is how the beginning, the first 10 minutes, has nothing  to do with the episode itself.  Like, there'll just be this drastic change at the beginning.  It's called vamping.  Is that what it is?  Because you'll be going with the storyline and go, okay, okay, wait, what just happened?  Just completely switched gears, and now they're offshore somewhere gambling. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know what happened.  It turns out people hate narrative thrust.  Yeah, I guess.  So, you guys have gotten away typically, too.  Like, there's always seems to be this edgy show.  Like, The Simpsons could take things a lot farther than, like, a lot of traditional sitcoms.  Maybe it's the cartoon angle, or it's just the fact that it was so popular.  Is there anything that you guys really wanted to do that they just would not let you do?  Well, we used to be able to show Homer's butt crack, and now we can't.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Well, the children.  We all have to think of what the children would think. 
[01:45:00]  You can't show cartoon butt crack anymore.  A child.  Do you think a child would chuckle at Homer's butt crack or go crazy and shoot up his school?  Like, the priorities are a little weird these days.  I don't think cartoon butt crack is really a problem.  Have you seen this butt crack?  Is it really bad?  It's a heck of a thing.  Okay.  I could be wrong, though.  They just, it's like they were perversely trying to think of what was most important  to us and take that away.  Yeah, yeah.  Homer's butt crack? 
[01:45:30]  No.  It's like, you remember the late 1990s when you could just see butt cracks anywhere you  wanted?  Yeah.  Those were the days.  Take Maggie, we said.  And also, earlier on, and you still get away with this, but I'm wondering if there's any  more of a backlash.  The goofing on Fox is a great inside joke.  It's hysterical.  It's hysterical, and early on, it was really funny because, I mean, Fox was the joke kind  of network, and now, do you catch any flack from the big wigs over there? 
[01:46:00]  We never did.  No?  We never have.  Not since we discovered that Rupert was ticklish.  No, there's even a big joke in the film, actually, where we make fun of the Fox network.  Oh, yeah.  The first movie to make fun of a TV network.  Yeah.  That definitely showed, like, some bravery and stuff, and it was that inside joke kind  of a thing that I think was one of the features that made it really catch on, where you'd just  look and go, wow, that's kind of cool that they did that.  But, again, early Fox was like, married with children how many years? 
[01:46:30]  Jesus Christ.  Right.  Enough already.  We get it.  The daughter's sexy.  Father doesn't want to do anything.  By the way, he had a great butt crack.  Yes.  And we could see his butt crack.  No pixelation there.  I think that's what ruined it, when they figured out how to pixelate.  They just did.  They wanted to pixelate butt crack, but we didn't have the technology.  It took, like, Lucasfilm to make up the pixelation.  Excuse me.  We didn't come here to talk about butt crack.  We didn't want to talk about pig waste.  Yes.  Pig waste.  Pig waste.  In the Simpsons movie. 
[01:47:00]  Pig waste.  Well, James, you've been involved.  I mean, it's, you know, your resume, it's obviously just a string of failures, like,  you know, taxi.  Mary Tyler Moore wrote a...  I can explain that.  Are one of these shows even still on the air?  I mean, you know, it's very rare to meet a guy who's had as many, like, successes as  you have.  I mean, one of my favorite things, this is a little off the subject, Danny DeVito getting  best character ever.  Oh, man.  On TV Guide. 
[01:47:30]  That had to make you feel good.  And Carol O'Connor was good, but I always thought that Louis de Palma was a better character.  Yeah, it was great.  You know, and Danny went nuts.  And my best moment in the Simpsons film is, in that same sense you're talking about, there's  a shot of Homer trudging through the snow alone, and Dan Castellaneta mainly improvising what  he says, and suddenly I saw him like that, like I used to see Danny, like that kind of  comic character.  Can I say that was the best example of getting back on track you're ever going to see? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, right?  Forget about what I did, it's what I'm doing.  He took the steering wheel and went right back.  July 27th.  Ah, July 27th.  Mary Tyler, more Simpsons dialogue.  I think that was the day that I heard Danny coincidentally.  Jeez.  What a pro.  What a pro.  Well, that's why he runs a ship, you know?  Well, I would have liked to have gotten back to at least one taxi thing. 
[01:48:30]  Taxi is, you know, I just, it was the best experience, I think, in all our lives.  Everybody was with that show.  And we all knew it at the time, one of those miracles.  Yeah.  Like, looking back, we knew we loved it and we were lucky to have it.  Why is season four not out yet?  I'm in the DVD stores.  Man.  Is that coming out soon?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, I wanted to do the whole thing and have us all talk because we all loved it  so much and, you know, it hasn't happened yet.  It's driving me nuts.  I keep checking for Taxi season four. 
[01:49:00]  I know it's a little off the subject of the new movie, but that's just one movie.  One movie.  One movie.  Yeah.  One movie's coming out in August.  Right after the Simpsons movie.  July 27th.  July 27th.  It seemed back then you could have really obnoxious, genuinely obnoxious characters  that didn't have this little, you know, had to, at the end, kind of become good or anything  like that.  Like, Louis was just a miserable little, you know, every situation he was in was just horrible. 
[01:49:30]  What was that one episode that Jimmy brings up about the drugs, the pills?  The greatest.  Oh, man.  Like, you couldn't do that.  He hooks up with Zena's hot friend and she's on drugs and she sobers up and she's like,  were you taller?  And he's like, no.  And she's like, were you better looking?  He's like, no.  And he's like, you need pills?  I'll go, I'll get you pills.  He's going to get her doped up again to have sex with her.  How great is that?  Bear kiss is the funniest, is the most I ever laughed at anything in my life.  Because Danny unhinged his mouth like a snake. 
[01:50:00]  It's a great thing.  His mouth just opens like a snake and he locks on it.  It was really great.  But you just didn't have to be politically correct or you didn't have to have it wrap  up where the character then became nice or learned something.  People laughed at genuinely obnoxious people that just were uncaring and miserable.  And now it just seems like you've got to have some kind of a, you know, yeah, some redemption,  right?  Or somebody's got to, you know, it's got to have a payoff. 
[01:50:30]  We have the Reverend Jim doing monologues about peyote experiences.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could not do that now.  And I think that's been so detrimental, especially to network television.  Check out Hannah Montana.  It's loaded with drug stuff.  So if you guys like language wise and stuff like that, I mean, there's obviously the butt  crack thing, but was there subjects and certain things that when you, I mean, right now you're  probably way above that with anywhere you're writing, but did you have stuff that like, 
[01:51:00]  ah, no, you can't joke about that.  Like, ah, no, we'd rather not have you go there and kind of veto scripts or things like  that?  No, that really is what we're trying to do.  You know, um, occasionally there would be crazy notes.  Like, ah, there was a, a sensor note.  Once we had Santa Claus holding a gun and they said, well, it could be the Easter bunny.  Isn't that odd?  Yes.  They're like very bizarre things and you just, you know, but yeah, you know, oh, those Jews. 
[01:51:30]  I have to say they gave us a real fight on a joke that they thought was about Catholics  and instead of saying, cut the joke, I said, it's not about Catholics.  It's about something else.  We're just using Catholics as a reference.  And he said, well, could you at least change it to Methodist?  It's just amazing.  Where did they come up with it?  We had like this evil store that we called Sprawl Mart.  And then below the sign said, a parody of Walmart.  No, no, you can't say that.  So we said, all right, what if we say not a parody of Walmart? 
[01:52:00]  They go, okay.  Oh, God.  Tell them the Viagra.  The two names that you had were one.  Oh, yeah.  Jam it in was one.  I think that was the better of the two.  Like, they said, no, that's all right.  The first one was Bonestra.  There was a pickup line that they allowed in where Grandpa was talking to a woman and 
[01:52:30]  his name is Abraham, and he said, how about giving Honest Abe another term in the Oval  Office?  And like, that was an acceptable answer.  And sometimes you go, wait, but that's, okay.  What sitcom do you watch that makes you laugh?  I like The Office.  Yeah.  The original with Gervais?  Both.  Well, yeah, that was a classic.  The original was amazing. 
[01:53:00]  Gervais is ridiculous.  What about, I've noticed a couple of cartoon wars, little animation wars happening, and  South Park has parodied you guys.  You know those guys?  I've never met them, but...  Never met them?  And South Park, to me, is the flat-out genius work going on regularly.  Yeah.  I think it just, you know, it's the best of the best.  Yeah, I remember that one episode, Simpsons did it, where they just run around and every  bit he did, it was just, the Simpsons had done it already, and they were very upset with  that. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, yeah, we gotta take a break.  These guys can stick around for a little longer, we just found out.  Is that cool?  You guys are good?  Sure.  All right.  So the movie, of course, the Simpsons movie, July 27th.  More with these guys in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're having a lot of fun with James L. Brooks, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and David Silverman.  And the Simpsons movie comes out July 27th.  We're all very, very excited about that.  And we were pretty much bonding with these guys.  We're taking the same meetings with lawyers over content and how silly it gets. 
[01:54:00]  We were talking about standards and practices, yeah.  And how it doesn't even matter anymore.  It's not really them that you have to worry about.  It's the company you work for saying, well, we're going to voluntarily cut this back and  this.  And I was just explaining how they actually gave us a book called Words Hurt.  And the laugh that we got out of these guys made us feel really good today.  They said you were going to read it aloud again.  Yeah, again.  You know, we did about an hour on it on our show. 
[01:54:30]  And it was hilarious.  Our listeners loved it.  We loved it.  How ridiculous it was.  And then we had to take another meeting.  You really can't make fun of this, you know.  You really hurt us.  You had to read like this, a little skit type thing.  And then there was multiple choice questions of what was wrong with what you just read.  And it was like, a gay man is a hairdresser.  And, you know, that was bad because you're stereotyping the gay man as the hairdresser.  Meanwhile, go get your hair cut.  Go get your hair cut. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, it's probably going to be a gay gentleman if it's a guy.  Al, what did you say?  You said something that was...  I was just saying it could be better.  It could be a new Adam Sandler movie.  I was picking that up from...  We did about an hour on that movie today, too.  We had laughed at the trailer like we all have and we've seen it, you know.  Oh, just hysterical.  I can't look at the posters around the city without just laughing and laughing.  Adam Sandler.  Look, there are two guys getting married. 
[01:55:30]  Stop.  It's hysterical.  A fat one, a skinny one.  Get out of here.  And they got manly jobs.  How predictable.  Yuck.  What animation?  What cartoons do you grow up enjoying?  Watch.  Do you use any...  You know, do you give homages to any of those...  Bullwinkle is really a bunch.  Bullwinkle, really.  The whole thing about that you, you know, loved it as a kid and then realized how smart  it was as an adult is something we've always had.  Yeah.  We did a whole homage to Bullwinkle in the opening of Couch Gag. 
[01:56:00]  We did a Bullwinkle-style Couch Gag.  That really weird bit of animation where there's lightning flashing and rocking Bullwinkle  pop out of the ground.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  The whole thing like that.  That's great.  Yeah.  The old fractured fairy tales and those things were definitely not made for children.  No.  I grew up on the Bullwinkle show, the old, you know, Warner Brothers cartoons that were  on.  And, you know, Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound were pretty much those.  Those are my mentors. 
[01:56:30]  Pretty much it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old Warner Brothers, Bugs Bunny.  They took all the violence out of the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  I saw an edit.  I saw an edit.  I saw an edit of the episode where Wabbit Season, Duck Season, which is just famous, where they  would not show them shooting each other.  It's the whole gist of the whole piece.  Don't show that one.  Right.  It's the whole thing.  They would cut to this still of Bugs, like, in his hole.  And you'd hear a bang.  And then you'd see Daffy with the bill up on top of his head and kind of wrap it back 
[01:57:00]  around the front.  And as a kid, you know, seeing it as a kid, you'd be like, what the hell are they cutting  this out?  Too violent.  Exactly.  They want to make sure you don't, you know, blow ducks with a shotgun.  Right.  Don't shoot that duck.  Well, there's a book they gave us, Guns Hurt.  Ridiculous.  Guns have played a big part on The Simpsons.  Apparently, you didn't pay much attention to that one. 
[01:57:30]  What do you see as the biggest, like, because sitcoms have changed so much, besides the believable  sets, you know, and how they're dressed just like the way real people live, you know, arena-sized  living rooms and, you know, multicolored, you know, just the way we all see homes on  a daily basis.  What would you say is the biggest difference, whether it's in content or whatever?  The weight of the male lead.  God damn, he's right. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, we went through a phase, I guess, in the, what was it, the 80s?  Where they went with the typical stupid husband-father character, which went on and on for a few  years, and then they kind of changed it to the, the father is a comedian.  He's got some other job, but everything he says is funny.  That was Raymond and with King of Queens.  You ever, I mean, you just don't know people like that, unless you know Jimmy Norton. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, well.  Who's a stand-up comic.  Yeah, but I'm not a family man.  But you had, you were on Lucky Louie.  Well, yeah, I mean, we all, we all, we all.  Anyone see Lucky Louie on HBO?  Yeah, I saw, I saw.  See, there you go.  They're very nice people.  These guys from The Simpsons, I was, you know, I'm one and done.  It seems like the obsession, the obsession with looks, it's like when you look at the old  shows, I mean, whether it was Red Foxx or it was Carol O'Connor, Gene Stapleton, or again, 
[01:59:00]  Taxi, except for, I guess Danza was good-looking and Mary Lou Henner, yeah, I guess that's a  bad example because they were all good-looking except for Louie and Judd Hirsch.  All right, so I'll just get like, destroyed myself and my own awful point.  Hey, we got a lot of Simpsons fans on the lines here.  Let's say hi to Dan in New Rochelle.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just got a quick question.  I was just wondering if there are any episodes that used to air that you are not allowed to  air anymore.  Wow, that's a good question.  No, we had one which was written in the 90s about the World Trade Center, which we pulled 
[01:59:30]  for a year, but obviously, like a lot of things, it wasn't, you know, ever intended as any  reference to the 9-11.  Yeah.  That's it.  They all air.  Right.  Really?  And who was your favorite cameo on The Simpsons?  Huh.  Mine was James Woods, I think, just for his performance.  He was so hilarious, and he had such terrific ad-libs that were great to animate, and one of the  animators, Bob Anderson, really studied a lot of his films to get these little weird 
[02:00:00]  mannerisms, the way he would speak like this, and so that was great fun.  I say Michael Jackson, as I always remember that day the most.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, yeah, that must have been huge, especially back then.  Michael Jackson.  I think Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had it.  That was a big thrill for me.  That was amazing, because they came in afterwards, you know, and...  It was when Mick Jagger was there, and people started to say, will you sign the picture,  will you sign this picture, will you sign this picture, will you sign it?  Then he fined, he was cooperating. 
[02:00:30]  People started to bring out the guitars.  People started to...  And until finally...  Oh, yeah.  Finally, at a certain point, he went from perfectly mannered to I'll kill to get out of here.  It's like, how many chances are you going to get that, to have a guitar signed, though,  by Mick?  Yeah, it was really cool.  It was really cool.  And Keith was a lot of fun.  Keith signed anything anybody put in front of him, summons.  And he put the date on everything.  He goes, I like Wright in 2004, because I didn't think I'd ever live this year. 
[02:01:00]  He was saying that in 68.  Any, like, deadline on the show?  Obviously, any time you ask this, I'm sure you say no.  Did you think it was going to last this long?  But are you looking like, yeah, we might want to wrap it up after a few years or, you know,  go out on top kind of a thing?  Or are you just going to keep riding it? 
[02:01:30]  Well, the movie is actually, you know, something that's just reinvigorated all of us.  And, you know, to me, I'd love to keep doing this show, especially in the wake of how well  this has all been received.  Yeah.  It's just a lot of times, though, people, yeah, there have been a few shows.  They should have maybe gone up.  I'm not talking about you guys, obviously.  Don't get mad at me, please.  I'm leaving.  Jesus Christ.  I know this was going so well.  Not a goddamn movie, for Christ's sake.  What am I talking about?  The Simpsons is different in that you're not dealing with actors who look. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, man, words hurt, you know.  Huh?  Words hurt.  Words hurt.  Words hurt.  I got to read that again.  Jesus.  You're not dealing with actors that have different looks or get married or get pregnant.  You're dealing with animation, so it's like you guys will, it seems like you won't run  out of steam because all you have to do is just have the minds behind it and it will  work.  And I don't think that's not what ruins sitcoms.  It's like the actual actors or the actresses, so you guys don't have to worry about that.  That's another big question.  No, no, but I was, I don't know how.  I was saying something nice, and yet I sucked the energy. 
[02:02:30]  I was like, just a bomb went off in here, and I just, everybody died, including myself.  Oh, boy, does it.  Oh, what a thump.  Do we have another caller we could go to?  Where's the goddamn caller?  Caller, are you there?  I meant to say yeah.  I can feel myself losing my steam.  Like, no, but actors die. 
[02:03:00]  We can take another one here.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys, I'm real nervous.  I'm talking to a genius.  Yeah, Jim Norton.  Oh, they laughed a little too hard.  I know, they did.  They saw the irony immediately.  Oh, that guy, he's an ass.  We get it.  Best-selling author, Jim Norton.  Yeah, go ahead, Mark.  Yeah, so did you guys ever get fined for anything you've ever done in an episode?  No, no, no fine was ever levied against us.  Fox has gotten fined for a couple things, so they're skittish, you know, because of that. 
[02:03:30]  But we got spanked once.  So has there ever been, like, an FCC complaint brought at all or no?  And how do you guys feel about being on the Family Guide?  Oh, no.  What did he ask on the Family Guide?  How do you feel about what?  How do you guys feel about being on the Family Guide?  I was going to make believe I didn't hear it myself, but.  I actually did not hear him.  I don't think he's nervous at all. 
[02:04:00]  What is he saying?  I don't know.  With their lack of answer, it sounds like pending litigation.  I just heard Family Guide.  You just can hear Family Guide.  Oh, how did you feel about being on Family Guide?  Yeah.  I guess Family Guide did an episode where, you know, they do that.  Well, we parody them, and it's, you know.  It's a funny show.  Yeah.  Who would win in a fight?  I know, you animation guys are like gangsters.  You're going to start shooting each other.  Hey, you callers can't see us, but we're really buff. 
[02:04:30]  You don't have to be the beat-up Seth.  It's true.  What almighty.  A little guy.  You can work out and be funny, man.  We have no problem with a Family Guide.  Don't worry.  All right.  When's the movie coming out?  Oh, my God.  Give me the plug.  July 27th.  Everyone knows that.  July 27th.  What else can you tell us about the movie?  Nothing?  You're not going to give us anything?  How about a spoiler?  How about the ending?  Pig Waste.  How about something?  Pig Waste.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, they're looking at each other over there.  They might give us something. 
[02:05:00]  Come on.  We'll be thinking.  We'll be all over the internet.  Come on.  Help us out.  There's a special guest.  This is probably way too much, but Homer does something incredibly stupid.  Wow.  All right.  Look for that.  Stand by.  One of the, I think, the best visual jokes we've ever had in the life of the series is  in the first 10 minutes.  Geez, if that ain't a go out and buy your ticket.  And wait, wait, wait.  I think we can tell them, great ending.  Oh, okay. 
[02:05:30]  Good.  And do you know what a dope I am?  When he said one of the greatest visual jokes, I almost said, well, what is it?  Fool.  Well, here.  I'll show it to you.  There is a great guest star in the film who we chose, we were trying to find the most  likable person in America.  And I think we came pretty close.  Oh, please tell me it's someone from the Laugh Factory.  More mysteries.  Sandy Dick. 
[02:06:00]  There's actually two big guest stars.  There's a band and another guest star.  So you have a couple big guest stars.  Oh, cool.  And Albert Brooks is in it.  That's not a secret.  Well, Green is in it.  I mean, they know that.  A band?  Yeah.  What kind of band?  You just said.  Well, it's Green Day.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  I didn't hear it.  I'm sorry.  It was so great.  We heard a rumor that they wanted to be on The Simpsons.  Yeah.  And we were looking for it.  We needed a rock and roll band.  So we said, great.  It took us a year and a half to get them to call us back. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  Unfortunately, we're taking that long.  Yeah, they're busy and under the influence sometimes.  All right.  Of course, the movie.  The Simpsons.  Yes.  July 27th.  Go see it.  Is there a lot of cursing in it?  Not really.  I mean, we wanted to do something that was a movie and looked like a movie, but not really  push the envelope as far as language is concerned.  Yeah.  Homer doesn't drop the C-bomb, does he?  What's that?  No.  You guys should just shock everybody.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[02:07:00]  Imagine if he did that.  Awesome.  And just some of the most horribly racist stuff.  Oh, would that people just be shocked?  Team America, right?  No, but we're not like the South Park movie.  Their penis was bigger.  That'd be great if you made the Simpsons not a comedy.  It was all just like stuff from Mississippi burning.  Oh, Marge, a d*** move next door.  That's how you should end this whole thing.  Just screw it up, bro.  Just blow up your careers. 
[02:07:30]  Just go out with death threats.  That would be brilliant.  All right, we've got to say goodbye to these guys, unfortunately.  We had a lot of fun.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  Brilliant team, man.  Obviously, the show is such a success.  And July 27th, the film comes out.  We all can't wait.  Yes, best of luck that you won't need.  You guys should give away a million dollars to the next caller, right?  Yes, we will.  Do that every day.  It gets boring.  And Mike Rowe, of course, on Dirty Jobs at 150th job.  What is that showing? 
[02:08:00]  That's going to be Labor Day.  Ironically.  And oddly enough, my book, Happy Endings, while I'm whoring for everybody, I might as  well do it for myself.  Hey, I saw it yesterday.  It looks great, man.  And you have a fantastic publisher.  Thank you.  Yeah, she's very sexy.  You only put that cover in.  What did you think?  I thought, you know what?  If that's the ending, I'm not looking at the beginning.  Yeah.  That cover is awful.  Yeah.  And we'll see a lot of these people in Mansfield tomorrow.  Yeah, doing a show at the Tweeter Center.  If you have military ID, you get in for free. 
[02:08:30]  So just come.  There's a bunch of comments on the show.  You know, way to be specific.  You guys cool?  Anything else?  You all good?  We're going to be in Springfield, Vermont tomorrow.  Oh, that's right.  We didn't even get to talk about that.  That's right.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you guys so much.  Thanks, gentlemen.  Thank you so much.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Have a great weekend.  And we'll see you soon.  Opie and Dopey.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:09:00]  Potty Mouth Show.  Oh, that was a lot of fun, man.  Those guys are awesome.  Awesome, man.  Who?  We're on the Potty Mouth Show now.  Who are you even talking about?  The Simpsons.  I know.  Guys.  That was pretty cool.  Don't worry, Mike.  We just phone in this part of the show. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, just for a while.  And I don't?  Do I look nervous?  Not at all.  You're eating.  I'm drinking a smoothie.  What the hell?  We figure, what the hell, we'll finally admit it.  Phone it in.  Where were we?  Could you turn down the music?  Where were we?  I'm trying to remember where we were.  Could you turn down the rage?  Yeah, thanks for...  Oh, boy.  You're not letting up on this, are you?  On what?  I'm just trying to remember where we were.  I'll do the whole song. 
[02:10:00]  This is kind of a dirge, to be honest.  The guy won't leave it alone.  Is this even legal to do this?  I mean, I don't know.  You can sue me, I think.  No.  I got in major trouble.  It's a copyright thing.  Wow.  I think I know what you're about to play.  Are you trying to scare me?  No.  I think he is.  All right.  In that case, I'll go back to this clip.  We don't really have audio for this, do we?  It's too bad.  Because you would be hearing this cat making sounds of unbridled pleasure.  Unbridled?  You hardly ever hear that. 
[02:10:30]  No.  What is he chewing on?  What is he doing, Blair?  Looks like he...  What is happening?  Well, I tell you what.  This is some of the most gripping video we've ever had at the opportunity to bring you folks at home.  Oh, you sarcastic bastard, man.  Indeed.  Look at him.  There he is.  What?  I'm falling apart. 
[02:11:00]  Whose cat is that?  I think it's Lisa's.  Looks like Lisa's cat.  Is that Booker?  Oh, God.  All right.  It's Booker the cat.  Look, he's squirming in his seat.  This is a bag.  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  There's a crinkling sound once again.  Yes, once again.  The Cat Sack Cat Toy.  A bag for your cat. 
[02:11:30]  Listen, man.  It's 3.30 in the morning.  I've got the Cat Sack.  I've got literally dozens of viewers hanging on everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  And the TD gets in my ear and tells me, look, we have video.  We have video.  I'm like, okay.  So I throw to the video of a toy, essentially, whose efficacy depends entirely upon your ability  to hear the sound it makes.  Now, there's no audio on the video that's running.  So what the viewer sees is a cat trying to enjoy the Cat Sack vis-a-vis the sound that 
[02:12:00]  no one can hear.  And after rolling around in this tired hunk of paper for 10 minutes, the cat eventually,  I swear, he shrugs his little shoulders and just walks away with complete indifference,  leaving me out there to try and sell this character.  They always say, never work with animals, Mike.  Never, ever.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids, yeah.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Or kids.  Yeah, back to Mike Rowe, of course, from Dirty Jobs and Studio.  The cat from that video is now dead, I'm sure. 
[02:12:30]  That's the only consolation you can take.  10 years ago.  That's the cat like a little fat man.  It's dead.  It was buried in the sack.  In the sack.  Yeah, you can bury him in it.  Exactly.  It's more like I'm throwing him in the lake alive.  You're a husband.  And as they say, your wife's a cunt.  It's not a cat.  Oh, God.  We can say that now, because we're on FM.  Wait.  FM.  Let's make sure.  How's that?  Yeah, they're playing rock.  Yeah, they're playing music over there.  We're clear.  That would be awkward.  Let the cunts fly.  All right.  But between the two shows, Mike Rowe was telling us about geese. 
[02:13:00]  We got to find out about geese and MySpace pictures.  We're all obsessed with the MySpace pictures and stuff.  Well, yeah.  We're just...  I mean, who did...  Jimmy was saying we're basically on camera now in New York walking around more than we're  not.  I think Anthony said that.  Yeah, when you're outside on the streets, you're on camera more than you're not, whether  it's just somebody's webcam sticking out a window, surveillance cameras, security, traffic.  Look, I'm like this B-list celebrity type guy.  I mean, I'm still... 
[02:13:30]  You're on Larry King, my friend.  Well, that was something, actually.  You're moving up to the A team.  The point is, you're in a bar.  You're in a cafe.  You think you're alone, and you're not.  The whole cell phone thing...  I was in a bar two nights ago, just sitting around, minding my own business.  Some girls came over.  We had a nice chat.  It was fun.  And next morning, I wake up, and, you know, I'm on YouTube.  I'm on a MySpace page.  I mean, the picture...  It's like, you just have to assume, no matter where you are, no matter what you're doing,  it's being videoed.  Videotaped. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It used to just be a quick pic.  Yeah.  Like, they'd snap a quick pic.  Now, you've got videotape.  You're in China.  I mean, you're around the world, man.  I mean, it's just really...  It's off-putting.  But whatever, you know?  So, what was the other thing?  Oh, the geese.  Would you nudge her in the sack and say, hey, why'd you put me up on your MySpace?  If you wouldn't mind.  Hey, hey, you.  I think he's telling this story on our show, because, you know, he's trying to, like, say  face at home with somebody.  He's like, look, man, I'm sitting in a bar. 
[02:14:30]  He's hanging out.  He's hanging out.  I didn't even know this broad.  Took a picture.  It was on her MySpace.  What can I tell you?  How many people are listening, actually?  Yeah, there's nobody on this side.  Don't even worry about it.  We've still got about a million.  Well, it depends on what message board you go to.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Great.  Yeah, good point, good point, good point.  The geese.  What do you know about geese wrangling?  Nothing.  All right, very important work.  Only what I've heard from the Japanese, which is if you choke them at the time of orgasm,  their butthole clenches up, and it makes things a whole big bunch better. 
[02:15:00]  I thought that was German.  No, I heard Japanese, but I'm sure the Germans have done it.  They both surrendered at one point.  Okay.  And I thought it had something to do with chickens.  No, I heard geese, because their necks are so stranglable.  Oh, you are a twisted bastard, man.  You need six hands, though.  No.  Yeah.  You just work it like you used to see who was up first in a baseball game when you were  a kid.  Yeah.  You throw the bat, and then you work your fist up to the neck.  I think it's called choking up.  Is that it?  No. 
[02:15:30]  No.  Oh, when you choke up.  Yeah, choke up on that goose.  Yeah, I never really...  But you actually were testing these birds for that deadly avian flu.  Yeah.  This is one of those jobs where you look at it on paper, and you go, okay, we're going  to test birds for flu.  We get in, you get out, and you move on.  Yeah.  Hey, can I stop you?  Oh, yeah.  Can you do the rest of the story from that room over there?  Why?  Because he's been messing with the bird flu.  I've been tested, man.  Oh.  I'm almost totally cool.  Yeah? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  First of all, I don't think there is a bird flu.  Yeah, I don't know.  Tell you the truth.  I don't even think they're birds, to be honest.  I think they're cats and sacks flying around, perpetrating a colossal fraud.  Geese, you know, they're bigger than you think, stronger than you know, and they've got  these weird little things that will cut you on their wings, these little barbs.  On the wings?  On the underside of their wing is essentially a claw.  So you've got to pick them up.  Pterodactyl.  It's essentially, it's a flying dinosaur. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  But anyway, I'll get to that in a second.  The point is, this job seems simple.  Unfortunately, it takes place in a town called Clack Attack or something like that, about  20 miles south of the Arctic Circle.  So you fly to Anchorage, which is a joy.  I flew from New York.  And then you fly to Bethel.  Bethel is basically Deadwood.  It's a tiny town in the middle, truly, of nothing.  It's in the tundra.  And then you hire a bush pilot, who seems crazy, and he flies you two and a half hours  in a 1959 de Havilland army plane. 
[02:17:00]  Fuck that.  North.  Okay?  So for hours, you're flying over what looks like fairways on a golf course, you know, punctuated  by these ponds of frozen glacial water that come up through the permafrost.  It's an amazing sight.  Must be.  But you're flying away from anything that could ever be confused with civilization.  So, you know, with every passing minute, you're like, crap.  You know.  How's the first class in one of those de Havillands?  It's nice, but the movie is pedantic. 
[02:17:30]  It's really bad.  They show the goose fucker.  Local documentary.  The guy whose wife died.  March of the Squab.  So we finally spot the town.  And the town is, picture every outhouse you've ever seen.  All right?  Now, picture four of them side by side.  Those are the buildings.  There are four small wooden buildings next to one of these lakes in the middle of nowhere. 
[02:18:00]  The Bering Sea is 20 miles to the left.  The Arctic is dead ahead.  And we land in the water.  It's a seaplane, so that's not expected.  I hope so.  And we get out.  And I meet these guys who are the geese wranglers.  And we get in ultralights.  Tiny little planes.  We fly to another little river.  We set up fencing.  There's not much coverage in an ultralight.  And it's got to be cold.  Well, actually, this time of year, it's not bad. 
[02:18:30]  It was like 55, maybe 60.  Okay.  I'm thinking pretty cold, exposed ultralight.  You're freezing.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, typically, it's unpleasant.  But it's not about the temperature at all.  It's about the mosquitoes.  When you're flying exposed like that, I mean, you are flying through clouds of hundreds of millions of mosquitoes.  Oh, my God.  You have to wear a net over your head or you'll choke.  You will choke to death on them.  When you open your mouth, they will fly down your gullet with extreme prejudice. 
[02:19:00]  It's awful.  It's awful.  So let me ask you, Mike.  Do these guys live there in this town?  Are they kind of stationed?  They're like military, like you do a couple months, you do a couple months?  No.  They're true believers.  They're Alaskan fish and game.  Fish and wildlife, actually.  And they come out of Bethel and Anchorage and they're handpicked to do this work.  I mean, it is like combat.  And sleeping in these places, I was there for about four days, it's just indescribable. 
[02:19:30]  Anyway, you chase the geese through the fencing that you set up, you get them in a pen, you  wrangle them in the pen, you try and grab them without them, you know, eviscerating you.  You flip them on their back, you put a steel tag on one of their little webbed feet to ID  them forever and then you take a cotton swab and you gently shove it into their ass and  then you wipe the smear on a little piece of litmus type paper and then you see if they  got the avian flu.  Why does it always have to be the ass?  Every time people have to do something with animals, it has to, the ass is involved. 
[02:20:00]  Well, you have two choices, it's mouth or ass.  And what we did was we searched for the area where the teeth were and decided we were safer  with the ass.  Plus, animals always forget their urine sample.  Let me ask you, Mike, now you're swabbing out the goose's asshole.  That's right.  Is the goose calm for this?  No, actually, but I'll tell you what they do.  At first glance, it's really shocking.  I thought the guy ripped the goose's head off. 
[02:20:30]  What he does is he just bends it totally around and shoves it under its wing and then puts  the wing over the head.  Now, they bend that way, apparently, and I guess that's how they sleep.  But the first time you see a man grab a goose's head and spin it all the way around and shove  it under its wing, you think you're witnessing violence.  Snapping his neck.  But it's not.  It actually puts them in sort of a little narcoleptic haze.  And they lie there somewhat stupefied.  And then you put them on their backs.  And then you can go about the important work of violating them.  Shoving them. 
[02:21:00]  You know, and we all just never believe the people that say that aliens came down, took  them, and stuck something up their ass.  Yet, it's constantly what we're doing to wildlife.  It sure is.  Shoving various implements up their ass.  Believe me, that goose is telling other geese, I'm telling you, they grabbed me, yeah,  they were on a big ship, they landed, shut your mouth.  Exactly.  How many animal asses have you been up, Mike?  How many animals are there?  Really?  I mean, yeah, I would say, you know, if you make a list of likely barnyard. 
[02:21:30]  See, these are the questions Larry King didn't ask yet, you know.  No, and when he did, they were in a truncated form.  Asses, farm.  No, wait.  Right, right, right.  Number.  Number.  Do you like index?  What?  Why?  And you know that, by the way, that goose neck bending was something discovered by accident.  Some guy's wife, her pet goose was whacking while he was trying to watch something.  He's like, you're dead, you're dead.  And he did that, and the fucking wing just snapped.  It was alive.  It was fine. 
[02:22:00]  I guess I put it to sleep.  Yeah.  Well, fuck me.  Well, that's the swab up the goose's ass, and you didn't find any avian flu, I guess.  Well, I'll tell you, here's what I really learned the flaw in the process was.  After they test them for avian flu, they take the swab and they put it in this carefully  labeled little test tube, and then they categorize it, and then they ship them off to the lab. 
[02:22:30]  And they, you know, of course, they release the geese.  So I'm thinking, hey, if it comes back positive, what the hell are we going to do?  I mean, we're going to go on some freaking wild goose chase, if you will, to find, you know,  and they're like, yeah, well, you know, it rarely comes back positive.  And I'm like, they're just wasting time.  What are we doing here?  We look for the one with NyQuil under his wing and a tissue.  They assume the goose will start missing work and come in for a further checkup. 
[02:23:00]  Then they'll get him.  1444 is behaving erratically.  Am I, uh, is there any electricity up there or no?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No, nothing.  And, uh, yeah, look, I mean, I love to camp.  I've spent a lot of time outdoors, but these three nights with these mosquitoes and these  three or four dudes who live up there all the time, I'll never forget.  Two of them had mastered an amazing talent of both snoring and farting simultaneously.  And I don't know. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, it's, it's impossible really to imitate it, but the closest I can come is all night.  Now, if you've got two guys going, and you know, if you get it set up just so, it's like  some horrible symphony that won't stop.  And if you factor that in with that, you know, the sound the mosquito makes when it vectors  in, you know, yeah, that it never stops.  So mosquitoes are coming into the place?  No, but the problem is you can't walk into your little pit of despair without bringing 
[02:24:00]  the mosquitoes in because I'm talking four, five, six hundred are on your back.  All right.  When you walk in, yeah, you wear a long sleeve shirt and you cover yourself with deep.  And before you go into a building, they have these little like palm fronds that they leave  outside and you take them and you very quickly just over and over your body.  All right.  You just wipe these things over your body.  So now the mosquitoes are in a cloud, which is manageable.  And then you run through the cloud, slam the door behind you. 
[02:24:30]  And if you're lucky, you'll only bring a dozen in.  But if you're a moron like me and you get up at three in the morning to go outside and  pee.  And by the way, if you've never taken a mosquito bite into Johnson, horrible way to increase  size.  I actually have, but the mosquito weighed 250.  And charged the fortune.  But yeah, if you forget to do that, you'll bring 200 of them in.  And it's hideous.  You can't walk.  You literally, you get bitten everywhere you go. 
[02:25:00]  Everywhere you go.  How many bites at one time, you think?  I actually followed the rules, you know.  I mean, I stayed covered with feet all the time.  Because if I get bit, I mean, I've been bit in the eyelids a few times on shoots.  And you're talking about canceling the next day.  Yeah.  Because you can't open your eyes, you know.  And it's really hard to shoot if you don't know where the camera is.  But, you know, I mean, I got bit.  I mean, you can still see some of these things on my leg.  Oh, yeah.  That crap.  That's the kind of bite we're talking about.  It gets in and then it, you know. 
[02:25:30]  Holy shit.  They're all scarred up.  Oh, yeah.  That's scarred from.  That is a friggin' shark tooth that won't heal from Shark Week last year.  Oh, that's from a year ago.  I played for the radio.  It's like on your shin.  Yeah.  It's off your shin on your left leg.  Well, there's no meat between your skin and your shin, you know.  And your little tooth went in.  And now I can't.  It just won't heal.  Oh, dude, you must just toss pussy off you.  Okay.  With a shark.  See this one?  Thresher shark. 
[02:26:00]  A deep voice.  Off the coast of Mandalay.  Excuse me, Jimmy.  Excuse me.  I'm going to relate to Mike Rowe.  On vacation, Tarsie Kekos.  Yeah, yeah.  I sliced my finger almost right off.  Oh, my goodness.  Dries in a pineapple.  Come on.  Somebody's shark skin suit.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Show your...  Well, sorry.  I'd have to have a lab technician come in.  I got this in Brazil.  And a tattoo.  I got it at a carnival.  Wow, a shark wound.  That's fucking great. 
[02:26:30]  That's a tooth.  Is that the best one you got?  Well, I got this actually.  Let's play Jaws.  Let's go.  That from the catfish was a good one.  What do you mean he has to go in five minutes?  Yeah, we saw that from the noodling.  Yeah, yeah, the noodling.  That's a bad one.  Hey, I wanted to ask you about when you were pulling that old codger's boat through the swamp.  Floyd Gilroy.  Floyd.  That was beautiful.  And you said the water was stinging you.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell was that?  Well, he called it bacteria.  But the truth is, you know, there are places in the Atchafalaya swamp where no human foot has ever stepped. 
[02:27:00]  And, you know, over millennia of settling, you know, the mud in there is, it has a strata to it.  You know, so like layer after layer and rotten vegetation is in it.  And as that vegetation rots, it creates methane.  So you have millions of little pockets of methane in the mud.  And when your foot goes through it, if you're just, if you're not wearing any protection, the methane will get into your skin and it'll, it'll just tear the ass out of you. 
[02:27:30]  It's horrible.  But it burns?  It burns badly.  Because all of a sudden, Mike starts going, hey, this is burning.  What is this?  It hurts.  It's like, it hurts.  And he's pulling this guy's boat because he kind of screwed up and it got into some shallows.  Yeah, we're in two feet of water.  So I'm pulling this cat through the Atchafalaya swamp.  You know, alligators everywhere, burning mud all over the place.  And he's just, he was maybe my favorite character ever.  Because, you know, when Dirty Jobs works well, it's when I meet people who, who don't care who I am, who have never been on TV. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  This guy just.  No aspiration to be on TV.  Right.  He, he was, when I met him, I was like, so Floyd, you, you seen Dirty Jobs?  I've seen it once or twice.  What do you think of it?  Not much.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, you know.  I didn't care.  So like the crew's backing up and we're like, this guy's a disaster.  I'm like, no, no, man.  This is our guy.  He's great.  This is our guy.  He's going to be great.  The creepiest things you do as far as the Dirty Jobs go is, is doing that in like swamps. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Or looking for the golf balls.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Oh, he, he went out with a couple of guys that go to golf courses and hop in those ponds.  Oh, yeah.  With the scuba gear.  And, and look for golf balls.  You know what kind of business that is for real?  I guess they make a lot of money because you had said they made.  Some of these balls are hit once, twice, you know, straight in the drink.  You can sell them for 75, 80 cents online, maybe a buck. 
[02:29:00]  These guys will recover a million in a year.  A million balls.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're talking, I mean, look.  Off one golf course?  No.  No, they go everywhere.  Off one hazard, Jimmy.  It's amazing.  It's like a magnetic sinkhole.  It's the most awful golfers ever.  Yeah, I mean, but look, right now, you know, they kind of went legit because they have deals  with the courses and the courses let them in and everybody's cut in.  But in the good old days, you'd sneak in over the fence at night and you would scuba  dive at dusk, you know, when the alligators are feeding. 
[02:29:30]  And that's exciting.  Really exciting.  When you're doing stuff like that, like when you're pulling the boat, just that feeling  of that muck in the water, it's so black, you don't know what's in there.  That's where it gets creepy with me, that how do you take that next step and what do  you feel?  What if you feel some moving little thing?  Shoot out from underneath you.  It's exciting.  And water moccasins.  Cotton mouths.  Yay!  Gar.  You know what gar are?  Gar.  Gar.  Gar. 
[02:30:00]  Alligator gar, they're called.  It's basically the demon spawn of an alligator and a snake.  So imagine a...  Imagine...  Who was the top in that relationship?  Who fucked who?  I have to know.  It's an eel with a mouth like a German shepherd.  And they're bad.  They will hurt you.  They bite.  They bite.  You probably don't see them coming like you would something else.  So what makes you scared then?  Have you ever been in a situation where you're like, man, I gotta make believe, you know, 
[02:30:30]  because the cameras are rolling, but I'm scared shitless.  I've never pretended to be braver than I am.  True.  And I am moderately...  I'm a good sport, but I think I still have a healthy fear of anything that you should  be healthily afraid of.  Is it those situations where you're outside dealing with the wild, or is it sometimes when  you're inside in these claustrophobic, man-made situations?  Inside.  And I just cleaned a boiler on a boat called the Medea.  The Medea is a 115-year-old yacht down in San Diego.  And I crawled inside this boiler, and literally, it's enough room to go shoulder to shoulder, 
[02:31:00]  but that's it.  And you crawl back about 15 feet, and then you basically use your body as a pipe cleaner.  They wrap you...  Now, listen, Jimmy, you are going to love this.  They wrap you in Tyvek, and then cover you in Vaseline, and then you crawl in.  They tie something to your foot in case you completely wig out and panic.  They have something to pull you out with.  But, you know, it is...  It's about the worst thing. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Because you...  I mean, it's literally...  When I say a pipe cleaner, I mean like a cleaner inside of a pipe.  I mean, literally.  Yeah, you just are as big as what you're in.  Do they dress you like a gerbil?  Mr. Lemmy Winks.  Wow.  That's rough.  Because I've seen you in some claustrophobic situations, and that seems to be where you  kind of go, yeah, it's getting a little tight in here.  They're lowering you down in the hurricane barrier at one point.  You're in a little room trying to pull those... 
[02:32:00]  What was it?  Solenoids.  The solenoids.  The little electro...  Iodes.  Yeah.  Diodes, whatever those are.  Keeps them from rusting.  Yeah, exactly.  And there were just like hundreds of these things all over.  500.  Yeah.  This one has to be replaced.  And you're pulling them off, but you're in a space that is really small.  You're a steel coffin.  And you're down pretty low in this thing.  Six stories.  And that looked a little creepy.  Bad.  Yeah, bad.  It's just bad, man.  But you know, like every job we do, that day was no different.  I'm shoulder to shoulder with somebody who does it all the time. 
[02:32:30]  And so, you know, to answer your question, it's like, yeah, sure, I'm a little wigged  out, but I'm never far from somebody who does it for a living.  So they know when to run.  They do.  And I keep an eye on them.  Yeah.  Have you ever tapped out?  Said, no way, I can't do this one.  No.  But I've...  Not one.  No, no.  Not one where they had an idea or someone came to you and said, I got the dirty job for  you.  You've done everything?  Well, the only shows I've passed on are ones that I know we couldn't air. 
[02:33:00]  Body Farm.  Oh, you couldn't air.  All right.  Dude, Body Farm.  I saw that on HBO once, yeah.  I read a book called Stiff all about...  It's great.  Oh, you've read Stiff?  I got Stiff, yeah.  You got Stiff?  I got Stiff.  I got Stiff when I walked in.  This is Mike.  During the Goose segment.  I sat back.  I don't know how big this thing gets.  Don't make me play more QVC audio to get you off the train of here.  No, Stiff is a book that came out a few years back, and it's all the stuff they  do with dead bodies, cadavers.  Yeah.  Like everything from car crash testing to throwing them in the body farms. 
[02:33:30]  The body farm where they check how quickly maggots fly land on them and lay eggs and maggots,  and then they could tell when they find a real body, based on that, how long they've  been sitting there and what conditions.  They put them in all sorts of weird situations, like murders, like maybe in a trunk of a car,  buried and all that.  But the cadaver thing, they practice plastic surgery on them.  Be very careful if you're going to donate your body to science. 
[02:34:00]  And I'm not saying this is good or bad.  I'm just saying that there's certain boxes you can check that will basically, like the  easiest box to check says, yeah, man, I'm going to give my body up to whatever is necessary  for it to do.  And that's cool.  But you should know that it's likely, or at least possible, that you could wind up in  the trunk of a Pinto dumped in a swamp for three weeks and then recovered so that people  will know what a body from the trunk of a Pinto in a swamp looks like.  I got to bring that book in because some of the things they did, I couldn't believe it. 
[02:34:30]  Like they practice guns.  They shoot cadavers to see what kind of injuries it would do to a body.  I guess maybe new weapons or something.  I don't know.  But some of the stuff was, yeah, go ahead.  No, no, no, there's a box you can check where, like he said, but there's also, you can choose  where your body will be on the body farm.  And I, I don't know if you know that.  Oh, really, Jim?  There's a little box on your license.  Oh, here we go.  And I said that I don't want to be in a Pinto trunk.  I checked the box.  And there is actually a place that says between two blonde girls' ass cheeks. 
[02:35:00]  Like they want to see if a girl's asshole smothers you.  I really ran out of steam with this one.  I had potential.  Excuse me.  All right.  I just, I should have just said I didn't.  I don't know why I said that they sanctioned that because there's no way to.  So I wrote in between a blonde girl's ass cheeks.  End of joke.  That joke is now being put in a Pinto trunk.  And lowered shelf life of three seconds.  And if possible, I'd like to try it before I die.  Hey, why wouldn't they air the Body Farm show? 
[02:35:30]  I got 2,000 letters last week from kids.  Kids are watching this show.  Oh, boy.  And you know what?  Could that go on a DVD someday or something?  It could.  Did you film this episode?  I did, but not for dirty jobs.  I was doing a couple things at the same time.  It was just a home movie.  Right.  Wandering through.  It's another Sunday.  Hey, let me show you this.  We're just walking through.  Look where I kicked this head.  Yeah.  Well, tell us about it.  I've read about this place for years. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Is it just downright creepy?  The smell's got to be horrific.  The place you're thinking about is in Louisiana.  Yep.  And the place I went to was actually in the East Bay in San Francisco.  And this was sort of, you know, as CSI units pop up more and more,  a lot of the testing is actually done more locally.  So the big ones that get, like, all the press,  those are down south where the climate can really be your friend.  Can you imagine just wandering in the woods or whatever  and somehow getting inside this thing?  Hey, what's here? 
[02:36:30]  But I'm sure it's, you know, fencing pretty good and all that.  I hope so.  Well, what did you see when you went through one?  Mainly, well, I went with a crime scene cleanup guy,  and the scene was about crime scene cleanup.  And then later he took me back to the lab and he just showed me  half a dozen different corpses in various states of decomposition  and explained where they'd come from and why they had them.  I wasn't on the front line of the recovery.  I was just there to see, wow, that's the after, you know,  and it ain't good.  I mean, really, it's fascinating. 
[02:37:00]  If it's on Showtime, great, there's your show.  But really, you know, Dirty Jobs, it's way broader.  How do you make that funny, right, Michael?  And you can't really add that micro wit to that situation.  Say, that guy's been dead a while.  Rip his arm off.  Hey, what am I doing wrong?  Maybe juggle some body parts.  You know, wacky.  It really couldn't work.  Judging by her injuries, she liked to talk to her in the game.  Oh, God.  Hear me? 
[02:37:30]  What?  I'm saying he couldn't say that.  Of course he couldn't.  Hey, is there anything you guys wanted to do?  Like, any job you're like, fuck, that'd be great,  but they wouldn't give you, not the network,  but the job wouldn't give you access?  They go, no, no, no, we don't want any of this shown.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, you know, there's, remember, it's job-driven,  so there's money and there's corporations,  and, you know, you get a big corporation.  You know, Cargill is a huge company,  and they've got a gajillion little jobs that go on around the world. 
[02:38:00]  But, you know, once you get into liabilities and lawyers,  you know, it gets tough.  That's why I got like Floyd down in the Atchafalaya Swan.  That's why I wind up making charcoal in the Ozarks,  because, you know, I don't need big, giant, you know,  corporate hierarchies.  I like the entrepreneurial family that figured,  you know what, these are the cards we got,  these are the options we have,  let's figure out if we can make a living and get dirty.  So it just works better for them.  I can't believe you ate the food that those people made you, 
[02:38:30]  little sandwiches or whatever the hell that was.  There's never an excuse for bad manners.  I'd have found one.  What were they?  I don't know.  It was some type of, I don't even know what it was.  Was it neat?  Dude, let me tell you, the worst thing I've eaten,  and I'm not going to say where this was,  because it was prepared by a woman who loved me  and loved the job and was expressing her, you know,  her appreciation for us being there. 
[02:39:00]  She was actually the neighbor of somebody that we did a job with.  She served something that smelled so good.  I was literally drooling when I walked in.  It was like the best piece of steak you could have imagined.  That's what it smelled like.  When she put it down in front of me,  it was on a plate,  and I want you to imagine a small meatloaf,  like the whole meatloaf,  but just shrunk down like one of those miniature loaves of bread.  And when she put it in front of me,  it quivered a little. 
[02:39:30]  You know, like when you put Jell-O down quickly,  it'll shimmer.  I keep raising my hand.  Can I guess?  Yeah, go ahead.  Placenta?  No.  No.  Had it, though.  Gamey.  Tastes like chicken.  This was pure fat cut from the back of a pig,  and it's the special.  It's like country foie gras.  It's what you treat royalty to and with. 
[02:40:00]  And it sat there quivering,  and you have to cut into it.  Now, the top was like breaded,  and it smelled, like I said,  it smelled like French fries.  It smells pretty good,  but it's pure fat,  and when you bite into it,  it explodes in your mouth,  and the grease just runs down your chin.  Oh, God.  How bad is that for you, too?  Just pure pork fat.  Pure fat, and you sit down with the family,  and everybody has about three quarters of a pound of fat  in front of them,  and you all eat it. 
[02:40:30]  And, you know,  unless you're a complete schmuck,  you pretend to enjoy it.  I'm a complete schmuck.  Wow.  What you should have done was  you should have opened up the hot fat  and smashed her fucking face with it  and said,  eat it yourself, bitch.  That would send a message.  I'm glad you enjoy the show.  Where's your Nielsen box?  I don't see one.  I'd have just drilled a hole in it  and pleasured myself  in some hot fat.  This is what Roy also does with pig bags.  I don't want to insult you,  so I'll use it. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, the poor pig would hate that.  Hey, you want to change the subject a little bit?  I thought Mike had to go.  Do you have to go?  I don't know.  Do I?  Why did Eric say that?  Would it be funny?  Eric just made an executive decision.  You can't go yet.  No, just tell me.  It's okay.  What's up?  They said you had to go,  but we're saying you can't go.  We already locked the door.  You're not allowed.  Lock the door.  Until we get through this.  Let's not do the whole song.  This is kind of a dirge,  to be honest.  No, a friend's from the world.  And I'll have to be here 
[02:41:30]  So I face  The final curtain  My friend  Yeah  I'll state my case  That's nice  Of which I'm certain  Well, Mike told us.  He did a little opera.  Look at his thing on the house off.  Well, he's got a voice.  This is 1990  The first karaoke machines  sold in this country  were sold on QVC 
[02:42:00]  And we weren't sure  really how to sell them  You know, because it was like  Okay, it's a box  and you can sing from it  And hey, imagine the fun you'll have  And that's how we did it for a while  But then finally it was like  Well, this is stupid  We're going to have to sing something  You're going to have to demonstrate it  So we started singing  And oh my God  I wound up making an album  while I was there  I swear to God  I made an album  and it's the best of Robert Goulet  So, you know, they would sell it  basically with me singing on one side 
[02:42:30]  and then the orchestra  with nobody singing  and that's of course how  you know, we all know how  Carrie Opie works now  Yeah, sure  But in 1989  They had no idea  Nobody's like, what the hell is this?  What is it?  And that's what it is  Like the school  I've traveled  Did they have multiple camera cuts  with soft fades?  Yeah, with soft fades  Like the Dinah Shore show  or Merv or something  I like it 
[02:43:00]  You got a little echo going  Oh yeah  Pete Presley  Very good, man  Is it still going?  Of course it is  This is like my career  That's a little taste  And then the Little Mermaid  and Veronica thing  We got to get to this  I'm curious to see what happens  Do you have to leave, really?  I think I've  I don't know  Where's he going?  What?  Someone tell me  Was told he wanted to go back 
[02:43:30]  to his hotel  to get his cell phone  Oh no  Are you kidding me?  No, no  It's true  I left my phone there  but I'm not taking calls  at the moment  Apparently  I'm in no hurry  We get the weirdest excuses  to get these guys out of here, man  Eric, you want to explain  what happened  just so Mike doesn't think  that you're trying  to boot him out?  Yeah  What's that?  Be honest, Eric  By the way  you'll need a bra  in that shirt  Go ahead  Oh, Jesus  Now we're all going to cover up  Why?  The lady that accompanied Mike here 
[02:44:00]  Steve just tweaked his little titty  Said we need to get him out  in about five minutes  I said okay  He said he wanted to go back  to his hotel  because he left his cell phone  and he didn't want to go around  the rest of the day without it  Well, I wouldn't either  What were we talking about?  Well, let's just cancel  all the remaining meetings today  and then I won't need my phone  There you go  I mean, how hard could it be?  Let's find out about  Let's get Jill in here  Where's Jill?  I'd want to leave too  if I was being subject  to this crap  Well, the next clip 
[02:44:30]  is the  Alright, play one more clip  because I'm dying to know  what I said about Veronica  Sing along with the beasts  Sing along with the beauty  The beauty is kind of pretty  Is that embarrassing?  Blair, that ever happened to you?  You're sitting there  you're watching an animated film  and you suddenly find yourself  attracted to the animated figure  Isn't that terrible?  The Little Mermaid?  Oh  I mean, you know  I'm relatively secure in my manhood  so I can say that 
[02:45:00]  Can I tell you what?  Veronica in the Archies?  I think it was Veronica  I mean, how embarrassing  How embarrassing to have a thing  for an animated figure  If I were animated, by golly  That's Little Mermaid  I'd go to the beach more often  Here's a Lee Sands  flat front eel skin handbag  speaking of the beach  Oh, yeah!  Eels, ocean  All that for the segue  Obviously  Obviously an old radio guy  knows how to like 
[02:45:30]  speaking of  It's funny that you like the mermaid  but if you want the anal  you go to Big Ethel  Mike is the consummate professional  You're very kind  My God  You're very kind  Are you having fun?  Listening?  Jill, I'm in trouble, aren't I?  What happened?  I don't want you to miss  your next appointment  Oh, no  It can't be better than these guys, though  Well, it probably won't be as fun  but it's still definitely  very good for you  I don't want to hold Mike up  What's the next appointment?  I don't know  It's for a magazine 
[02:46:00]  that really wants to feature you  Mmm  Got a magazine  I think it's Swank  Swank  I remember Swank  That was in the same days  as like Wee  Swank, yeah  You'd find him in the woods  as a kid  and go, wow  This is a great thing  Ooh, I hit gold  Please say it's for black inches  Oh, that's  What about  What's that other one  that's out at the newsstand?  I don't know  Uncut PR?  It's fun  Where do you want to start?  Honcho  Honcho  Honcho is the one 
[02:46:30]  Jimmy always picks up  when we do the walkover  He goes to the magazine  and says  Give me a copy of Honcho  and there's just this  buff nude guy on the cover  I like perusing it with them  and we'll like  look through and critique everybody  And he shows the guy  at the newsstand  He's like  What do you think  of this gentleman here?  And just holds up  the worst picture  of just man-on-man action  That'd be a great dirty job  you know  having to videotape  those savages  going at it  It was great  Men do  All right  Mike  Mike Rowe  Always a pleasure 
[02:47:00]  Thank you  Can I have you on?  Can I call you  from someplace  exotic and inappropriate  Yeah, we're definitely  We're trying to do that  I'd like you to do that  Make sure he's got  the right numbers  All right, Roland?  Yeah, Roland  Make sure I've got  the right numbers  Hey, how about  Opie and Anthony  and a little Jimmy Norton  dirty job  like, you know  Thing  You're always trying  to sap the guests  into putting us  on their shows  Think about how cool  that would have been  It'd be great  It would be  I would love  You know what? 
[02:47:30]  If I could have called  for instance  and this was a  communication problem  but if I could have  called you guys  from the Arctic  Yeah  with that snoring  farting symphony  Oh my god  and actually  got that on tape  somehow  That would have been  awesome  I mean really  That's radio gold  What's the sat phones  don't work that far north?  Nothing works  A little rough  Nothing works  That's amazing  Uvula and a sphincter  I picked up a satellite phone  after I got lost  in the woods  upstate New York  for an entire  day and night  me and my girlfriend 
[02:48:00]  we did everything wrong  everything wrong  you're supposed to do hiking  we did it  and ended up  with no food  no water  lost in the woods  no cell signal  nothing  I saw a black bear  walking across our path  it started getting dark  it's raining  we found a lean-to  a wooden lean-to  that hunters use sometimes  slept there freezing  woke up  my ankles  I couldn't walk  because we had walked  up and down  so many mountains  throughout the day before 
[02:48:30]  sleeping in the cold  I woke up and went  oh my god  I'm gonna die here  because I can't walk  but trying  like a cripple  to walk  it's raining  I'm underneath trees  waiting for the water  to just drip into my mouth  and finally  we just made it out of there  and found a  a ranger station  and got out  drove us back to our car  and that was that  but for about  20 some odd hours  totally lost in the woods  after that  I went  I am buying  a satellite phone  got one

[02:55:30]  and then it had some apparatus  so as she's handing it over to Jimmy  she squeezed the apparatus  and shit from the cake penis  went flying all over Jimmy  that's when I realized  we're going to get along  with Jill just fine  swimmingly  from channel 11  so she had a great time  we had her on for about an hour  I think we're going to replay that  in the near future  within a week or so  and  she was on TV this morning  giving us a fine shout out  yeah  a little hello  I heard you on the radio yesterday  on Opie and Anthony

[02:57:00]  I was gonna make  a big star  she'll be an  entertainment reporter  on a national show  that's my prediction  yeah  but Opie Fontaine  comes along  with his blonde hair  and I don't know  what nationality  he has charmed  Irish would have  been a German  I believe  listen my  Kraut Mick friend  by the way  we downplayed  the themes today  unfortunately  because it's FU Friday  we had a very busy day  it's Point and Laugh Friday 
[02:57:30]  we were pointing and laughing  it might grow a lot  by the way  you didn't see that  because you're  listening on the radio  Mike's a good egg boy  I love Mike  he's hysterical  he could kick your ass  and sing to you  at the same time  and you're there  taunting him  with old clips  we could barely goof  on the My Way thing  because it was really good  sucks when that happens  Mike's a damn good  mine's my zipper open  little treat  that was my tribute  to Mike  I got a rod 
[02:58:00]  of his talent  little treat  ready to pop out  also mispronunciation  Friday  we also made fun  of Al Roker today  because it's Al Roker Friday  well it's just  we're crossing  that one off the list  don't worry  it was just a special one  but Roland told us  what  what was the reason  why Al Roker  didn't make our show  yesterday  please tell me  it's cancer  Roland came in here  maybe he could come in again  and he basically said  that they tried  the phone number  that Roland gave them  and it was busy  Fan swears 
[02:58:30]  and I believed them  because I was doing  the exact same thing  right around the time  Al was calling  because I knew  it was a big get for us  and it was going to make  for some really  interesting  confrontational radio  I also was staring at  that line  waiting for it to ring  to stop everything  so we could go right  to Al Roker  so we don't miss  the opportunity  right  and then  Roland said that  the publicist  after calling  this certain number  five times  and getting a busy signal  called Roland's cell phone  yeah  Roland 
[02:59:00]  no record right  I don't  I call myself  I don't  she said they called me  like several times  to get a hold of me  left a voicemail  and there was no  voicemail  or call lock  do you think she has  the wrong info on you  or no  is it possible  she's telling the truth  no  because we had a guest  before and she called  my cell phone  okay  she's just a lying whore  all right  most of them are  they protect their talent  yeah  all right  Tammy Faye 
[02:59:30]  on Larry King  yeah a lot of people  talking about  how's she doing  oh my god  she's a zombie  you know what was weird  I was watching the insider  these scumbags  Tammy Faye is dying of cancer  she should have been dead  by now  she's down to 65 pounds  she was on Larry King  she's still wearing the makeup  she looks just  she looks like a monster  from like a zombie movie  at this point  right  please tell me they  intro'd her that way  get that screen on  and then they do  this whole thing  it's so obvious  that she's gonna be dead  by the end of  next week probably 
[03:00:00]  you know  it's  the end is near  and then the insider  had to like tease  the fact that  her cancer has spread  like how does  why do you have to  make this story worse  it is what it is  you don't  you don't  you don't have to  pump this one up  she is  a wreck  she doesn't look good man  65 pounds  look at that  that's worse than not looking good  that  that is the walking dead  yeah  is she really 65 pounds  you're like  that's her actual weight  she said on Larry King 
[03:00:30]  oh  maybe we got the audio  she weighs 65 pounds  and here's the good news  she gained 5 pounds  you know who she looks like  she looks like that  woman that's smoking  in Beetlejuice  at the reception area  for the dead people  oh my god  man I don't wish  that shit on anybody  wow  why does cancer  fucking make you  lose so much weight  like what  it's eating you  it's a disease  that eats you  it's fucking eating you
