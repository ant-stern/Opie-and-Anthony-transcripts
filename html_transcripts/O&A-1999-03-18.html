<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting a frustrating encounter with a New York City police officer who blocked their access to their parking garage.  This was quickly followed by a volcanic eruption of frustration over missing photographs from their St. Patrick's Day broadcast at LeBarbat.  A significant number of photos, particularly those depicting nudity, were missing from Roger, a staff member's, computer.  The hosts detailed their arduous, expletive-laden attempts to retrieve the images, blaming Roger and expressing anger at WNEW's censorship policies, which allowed explicit content only on a separate website.  They repeatedly mentioned several partially or fully nude women at the event, including a "blonde monkey" whose numerous nude photos were missing.  The hosts blamed photographer "Earl" for the lack of nude photos, citing technical issues with his camera and distraction.  Listener calls followed, with some criticizing the hosts’ use of the word "pussy" and others reacting to the missing photos.  A prank caller shared workplace pranks.  Finally obtaining access to the photos, the hosts expressed further disappointment that the majority were not explicit, promising to post more as they became available, alongside an explanation of the technical issues.

The show continued with further listener backlash regarding the hosts’ use of "pussy," with callers expressing concern about children's exposure. Opie and Anthony defended their language, claiming it was contextual and that children were exposed to far worse. They admitted to frequent cursing between song fades.  A commercial break for Stack or Two, an energy supplement, followed, with humorous anecdotes about Opie's alleged overconsumption.  The show then moved to a discussion about celebrity arrests for publicity ("pussy arrests"), contrasted with more serious crimes, with a Brooklyn cop caller offering a perspective.

A large portion focused on the abysmal quality of photos taken by Black Earl at the St. Patrick's Day event.  The hosts and listeners expressed extreme disappointment at Earl's failure to capture nude shots of the blonde woman, despite many opportunities, highlighting other, less desirable images that *were* captured.  Discussions of Earl's potential punishment ensued, including whipping (acknowledging previous sensitivities and considering alternatives).  A song from an alleged Pope John Paul II CD and music video was played.  The segment concluded with more listener feedback and jokes about Earl's photographic incompetence and the missing nude photos.

[00:00:30]  to the cop on 57th and 7th.  What?  He's doing his job.  We're big supporters of the police department.  It doesn't mean that occasionally a cop can't be an asshole.  Everyone can be an a-hole.  We were drinking with half the cops of New York City yesterday  at our party at the Herd.  LeBarbat.  It sounded good.  But this cop today, what a-hole.  We made the mistake of asking to go through his little roadblock  to, like, I'd say 20 feet past where he had a 57th blocked off 
[00:01:00]  is the entrance to our parking garage.  Yeah.  And he had the road blocked off because something going on in Times Square.  Two miles down the road, something's up, so they've got to block traffic up here.  A sign's falling in Times Square.  Ooh, it might blow 50 blocks.  Ooh, better block off the whole city.  So he's got his silly little scooter, that little three-wheel scooter thing.  Maybe that's why he's so defensive.  He's got to drive around in that thing.  Could be hungover, too. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, he was probably at the gig yesterday.  Yeah.  And then we go, yeah, we're just going through, parking right over here.  No, you're not.  It's like, just parking over here.  We work right here.  We're pulling into the parking garage.  Not driving down to Times Square.  I'm very happy for you.  Get that out of here.  It's like, you know, screw you.  So every curse left my mouth.  So now, you know, it's not like an easy left, and then, oh, no, that's easy.  We'll take a left, and then a couple of rights.  Yeah, no.  Through eight billion other cars trying to get through.  It's just, you know. 
[00:02:00]  We were basically at the garage we needed to park at.  It took another half hour to park after that, when we got stopped.  Oh, no wonder you're in such happy boots.  Damn.  That's just the beginning of it.  We're pissed, and then we park in another garage, and then I lock the keys in the car.  Did you deal with it now, or wait for later?  No, thank God.  I had the window open a crack, so we were able to get a coat hanger in there.  Man.  What a pain in the ass, though.  Well, block all that stuff out. 
[00:02:30]  Go back to being on stage yesterday, having fun at LeBarback.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Gee, let me look at the pictures of that and see how.  Oh, that's right.  I don't have them.  Am I bringing up another sore subject?  Yeah, sore subject number 82.  Sorry.  Well, the deal is, if you go to the WNAW website, there's some cute pictures from our live broadcast  yesterday from LeBarback.  Yeah.  But no one wants to see Ants and My mugs.  No.  Who cares what we look like?  Our listeners want to see the T&A that was happening yesterday.  A lot of it was happening yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  We had the four sisters get up on stage, flash.  We had Jennifer and her beautiful 36 double Ds taking her top off.  We had that cute little blonde girl doing lap them up and doing a lap show.  I mean, great pictures.  They had something for the ladies, too, right?  Who cares?  Yeah, that guy showing his one nut.  One nut.  That was...  So we come in today.  I expect to get a disc that I will pop into the computer and upload the pictures to our  personal website.  And where are the pictures, Opie?  I don't know. 
[00:03:30]  Columbo has them?  No.  No, who knows?  So he gave them to Roger.  Roger.  Roger always seems to get the pictures of all these girls that are at appearances of ours.  It's like, where are they?  Roger has them.  Why does Roger have them?  And not only that, where are they?  Yeah.  Now I find out they're in his computer.  He's got to mail them to me because he doesn't even have the disc.  And then...  Remember the appearance we did at Valentine's Day?  Mm-hmm.  Remember all the professional photographer taking those pictures?  Yeah.  We find out he got those mailed to him.  He sent them back.  I never even saw the damn things. 
[00:04:00]  Why is he getting our pictures and sending them back without us even seeing them?  If that photographer still is listening, send them again.  Send them to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we never got to see the pictures.  Not promotions.  Not programming.  Not Roger.  Send them to Opie and Anthony at NEW.  He sent all those pictures of Spike and Tara and the other two going at it.  All the ones of them making out at the end of the night.  Spike with her girlfriend.  And where did they go?  Did you even see them? 
[00:04:30]  No, I didn't see them.  They got sent to Roger.  Oh, wait, we better send these back.  They're very dirty.  And then they got sent back.  Yeah.  I'm pissed.  I wanted to see those.  Well, that's for the Valentine's Day show.  So now we come in today.  Where are those pictures?  Roger has them.  And we're supposed to be happy Roger has them?  We're scared that he's going to, like, destroy the disc or something.  Destroy the disc.  God.  And we're playing by the rules because NEW told us that they just don't want nudity on their website.  That's fine.  We went through lawyers and all sorts of trouble to make sure that we worked something out. 
[00:05:00]  And the deal is, if you go to the semi-live studio cam in our section of the NEW website,  you read the disclaimer, you click on a link, and that takes you to one of our underground websites,  and there's all the nudity for everyone.  Right.  So we're pissed.  We want to see all those pictures.  Instead, on the NEW website, let's see.  Oh, there's a cute picture of Anthony and I in front of an NEW banner.  Who cares?  That's lovely.  And then there's a picture of George Killian.  You get to see what he looks like.  George Killian?  That's not too offensive.  Then there's a picture of just a crowd. 
[00:05:30]  Another picture of a bunch of drunk guys.  A picture of me interviewing Killian.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Anthony talking to two hot chicks that just happen to be nude,  but obviously they're fully clothed on the NEW site.  Which is all fine and well, but give us the good pictures.  We will do with them what we want to do.  And here's the guy showing a couple of girls his one nut.  Oh, my God.  And that's all we got.  And a couple of stupid scar pictures.  There's like ten pictures of me. 
[00:06:00]  I don't want to see my face.  God.  I don't know.  Let me see.  I don't know.  Let's see.  Oh, cute.  Did they get it?  If this isn't a CT.  There should have been a disc in my mailbox.  Well, now we got.  When I came in.  Well, now we have 12 pictures of that really hot blonde from the end of the show yesterday.  Doing a lap dance, but no clothes off.  Wow.  Wow.  That's pretty risque.  A picture of her in her bra. 
[00:06:30]  Is that okay for the website?  And Anthony real close to her butt.  But see how they cropped this picture?  There was more butt there to be seen.  If you look at the second to last picture from the St. Paddy's Day pictures, you could  tell that they cropped it so they didn't show too much butt of the blonde.  Well, there's all these pictures that I want to get up on the website that I don't have.  Well, we'll get them, man.  I don't have them.  We'll get them. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, these are all cute little, you know, PG pictures, but honestly, our listeners don't  really care.  They want to see the real stuff.  See the good stuff.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  He said he's going to email them to you, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Email.  Yeah.  Great.  So I would assume a little later on in the show, we'll have them up.  But just remember, from now on, NEW website, you know, it's got to be like PG pictures.  We understand that.  We sat down and we worked out this whole mess with management, you know?  We understand their feelings about it, but they did come to a compromise and they're 
[00:07:30]  allowing us to put all the nudity on our underground website.  Yeah.  Which just happens to be linked to the NEW website.  So you go into the air staff, click on our pictures, and then look for the live, semi-live  studio cam.  They'll be there later on.  There's one picture up already.  One of Jennifer and her 36 double Ds.  More to come before the show is over today.  All right?  You're going to get comment.  Yes.  I'm fine now. 
[00:08:00]  I'm wonderful.  Okay.  On the way, we got Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Bad company.  Want to hear from you guys today.  Fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  All right.  What are you doing March 28th?  Huh?  Hmm?  What are you doing March 28th?  10 days from today, Anthony.  Me?  Probably still waiting for the pictures to be given to me.  Well, if you don't have any plans, listen up and find out how you can win two free tickets  to the Rolling Stones at the Hartford Civic Center on Sunday, March 28th.

OmniPoint, 100% digital, 0% hassle.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Kenny Wayne Shepard, everything is broken off as CD Trouble Is and Bad Company 2.  It's Opie and very pissed off Anthony.  Huh?  What? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, I'm fine.  Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.  It's okay.  We'll just sit and wait.  Well, now Roger's getting mad at us because we're bitching, but our listeners are bitching  at us.  He's logging off the network.  He's got to come in and log on on my computer.  This should have been our number one priority today.  Everything else could wait.  After the live broadcast we had at LeBarbat yesterday, there were probably thousands of  people that couldn't make it that wanted to see what they missed with these pictures. 
[00:10:00]  The whole thing we're into is giving our listeners the pictures of the events that  we do.  Because if you can't make it there, it's cool to listen to it, but it kind of sucks that  you can't see what people look like and what the girls are doing or what's going on.  So we take a lot of pictures and we like putting them on right away.  That's why we do it ourselves.  We run the little webpage because we always get yelled at that, hey, it's cheesy.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles. 
[00:10:30]  Not the NEW website.  Our own personal page.  We don't need the bells and whistles.  We don't.  It's just there to pop pictures on that they don't allow on the NEW site.  Right.  So I like getting those pictures immediately because when you deal with some websites,  it takes you three months before you get the pictures off.  You're like, oh, great.  Yeah, that happened last year.  Right.  We like doing it.  Boom, next day.  So those pictures should be in my mailbox.  And people wonder why we want to do absolutely everything by ourselves around here.  Because we used to just take the pictures ourselves. 
[00:11:00]  Anthony has a digital camera.  We used to take the pictures when we were out and about.  We'd do the show, take the pictures.  Anthony would take the pictures, put them on the site hours later.  But for some reason, we decided to let others help us around here.  So someone else had the job of taking the pictures yesterday.  And now it's a whole cluster F.  Now, Roger had to log off of his computer.  Come back in and log on on this computer.  How long does it take to log off a computer?  He's not coming down here.  Turn the damn thing off.  Come in.  Pop your name and password in so I can put the pictures on my computer. 
[00:11:30]  And I will have them.  And then the people will see them.  I'm astounded.  We should have been going on the air at 315 and telling everyone, good news, guys.  The pictures are up and running.  Here's how you find them.  Poof.  Hello.  Hello.  Roger.  Oh, here he comes.  Roger.  What took you so long?  Come on, man.  Pop the name in.  I won't even look at your password.  Look, he's cursing on the air.  You're just cursing on the air.  He's cursing on the air. 
[00:12:00]  That's an FCC violation.  He's mad at us.  We're mad at him.  Our listeners are mad at us.  Look, he's fuming.  That's fine.  We're pissed.  We're not going to make believe we're not pissed.  Okay.  Let's all wait for it to boot up.  This is cool.  No, no, you've got to use the touch pad.  John.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  What do you got?  I was wondering, is Roger working for Lord Comover or something?  Like blatant censoring. 
[00:12:30]  What's next?  All right.  We're going to start putting a gag order on you guys.  No, no one will put a gag order on us.  Trust me.  We'd rather get fired than having a gag order.  I was listening to the show yesterday and figured out, you know what?  I'll get home tonight, do a little work on the computer, go online, and I'll see all  the pictures.  It's the next best thing to be in there.  Right.  Well, we have one really good picture in the semi-live studio cam, and the reason we have  that is because Anthony did grab one of the discs.  The only one that was near us.  Because all the other discs, when the pictures were taken, were rushed back to the station. 
[00:13:00]  You've got to have more than one camera there with someone else in hand that, you  know, it's like a spy thing going on here.  You know, I think we're just going to give the job to one of our listeners, where you  just come to every one of our events with a digital camera, you take the pictures, and  you hand us the discs.  Sure.  That'd be the best thing.  Exactly.  Oh, listen, guys.  Keep up the good work, man.  Hey, thank you, John.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  This is cute.  What now?  He's got no clue. 
[00:13:30]  No, you're cursing again.  He's cursing.  Don't curse.  You're live on the air.  Where's your little icon for you?  He's logged up.  We're waiting the appearance of these pictures.  Hi, N.A.W.  O.B. Nante.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up, boys?  This is Mike from Woodhaven.  How you guys doing?  Good, Mike.  Good.  I've been scouting you guys around, telling all my buds about it.  You guys are the best.  Hey, thanks.  Some great stuff.  Listen, we've got to do some pranks, man.  You never talk about pranks.  I'm the biggest prankster going.  Well, what do you want to do?  I work on a Florida commodity exchange. 
[00:14:00]  I get guys every day.  I paint their nails with white out.  I put, let's see, what's the new one today?  Today was we ordered lunch for everybody.  We were ordering cheeseburgers because of, well, tomorrow's going to be Lent, so we do  cheeseburgers with no ham.  Give me a cheeseburger with no meat, stuff like that.  Shut up.  I don't know what that's all about.  I have no idea.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, whose show is this?  Yours or Roger's?  I don't know.  I mean, uh...  Roger's taking what seems to be the problem.  Put your password in. 
[00:14:30]  Roger's putting his password in now.  Roger should be fired.  Okay.  All right, we've got to go, dude.  All right, man.  Great show.  Thanks.  What now?  Oh, my God.  Roger's cursing.  Roger's cursing now.  He's cursing.  Now we had to, like, dump out of our show.  Roger's cursing four times since being in here.  He's losing it.  Well, can we, like, could Anthony go down to your office?  We'll get Anthony on the phone, and we'll try to figure this whole mess out.  Okay, log back on on your computer. 
[00:15:00]  Not on this one.  Am I logged off?  Yes.  I'll deal with that.  Okay.  Log back on.  Pop up the little envelope with the pictures in it.  See, everyone is pissed at us, but, see,  there wouldn't have been a problem if we got to this as we left LeBarbat yesterday.  Anthony would have been able to go home and have the pictures on the website by midnight.  I don't care who else had these pictures, but I should have had them.  Like, it should have been me that had them, and then whoever else wants them. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Around the studio.  Not Roger, and then I don't have them to put them on the website.  The pictures should have been on the website for 15 hours by now.  Jesus.  It's now 340, and we still don't have the really good pictures from our broadcast.  It was amazing, watching like a retard with the touchpad trying to work it.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, this thing, oh, the guy yesterday with the professional camera gear.  Yeah.  From the Easy Mug Shots company.  Yeah.  Yo, I'm going to stop by tomorrow.  Rick told me that you're not doing a thing with the girls tomorrow. 
[00:16:00]  No, we're going to reschedule that Tuesday.  We'll talk to everyone about that later on.  But you could come by with the professional pictures you took yesterday.  Yeah, I'm still going to come by, yes.  All right.  I'm going to stop by right from the back.  Because I have a feeling you might have the only good pictures at this point, because  I'm starting to think the disc is not going to show up.  Well, in light of what I'm listening to you guys now, plus I'm taping it because I'm home  today, I saw those discs being pulled out of the camera from Earl and put in the pocket  of Roger. 
[00:16:30]  And I'm like, wait a minute, those ain't going to fly because I know how promotions  things work.  I mean, I've been dealing with this circuit for a while.  See, Earl, we got to yell at Earl today, too.  When he was done with each disc from the digital camera, he should have handed it to Anthony.  Right.  I agree, but it seemed like everything was hush-hush.  I mean, if you guys got the props and everything, why are they hiding, suppressing some of the  stuff?  But, yo, I ain't going through promotions.  I'm going through you guys.  I'll meet you guys tomorrow.  Yeah.  And Rick says, hey, he'll even put me on the air.  But that's not the main thing.  I just want to make sure I get the photos going. 
[00:17:00]  I know we've never met before, but there's a lot of things I'm involved in.  And you guys are hot, man.  I mean, I've turned some guys on the phone.  All right, all right, all right, dude.  No one wants to hear this stuff.  We'll see you tomorrow, though, okay?  Okay.  And we'll talk more off-air.  Okay, cool.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a quick break.  And, Anthony, you're going to go into Roger's office and figure it out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Boss has got to be loving this radio today.  So as soon as we get the pictures on the website, then we'll do a real show today.  He's cursing. 
[00:17:30]  I know.  He's cursing.  He's cursing in here.  Unbelievable.  All right, Rick, what's the latest on the pictures?  Anthony left the studio.  All right, Anthony just walked out.  They're going down to Roger's studio to see what they can do.  All right.  We'll be live from Roger's office next.  Anthony's going to either get the pictures or beat them up.  I think you're going to want to stick around.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Everlast, what it's like. 
[00:18:00]  It's Opie in the studio by myself.  On the phone, we've got producer Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  All right, you're down the hall?  Yeah, I made it into Roger's office.  He didn't want me in here, of course.  Okay.  But we're in here.  Ant's now sitting in front of the computer trying to figure out what's going on so we can try and find these pictures.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we're trying to get the R and X rated pictures from our broadcast yesterday from LeBarbat on our underground website.  And it's a big cluster F.  And now Anthony's on Roger's computer because for some reason Roger has our pictures. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Roger, what is this over here?  Is this a you, Spanky?  What are you doing?  Rick.  Put Anthony on.  All right, here we go.  Hello.  Hi, Anthony.  Hello.  Hi, Ant.  Hi.  How are you?  Oh, great, great.  This is what they call a cluster F.  I know, that's what he said.  So what's the deal?  I'm trying to get these pictures over to my computer.  Right.  But who can do that?  Blank, error, error.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:19:00]  Going into his little network thing.  See, this is how it works.  See, I just put the folder into your little network icon.  Now, he's pointing at his penis.  Now, when we log on at my computer, Roger, you can go into that and it will be there.  Then we can open them, as they say.  So what are the odds of getting the pics, Ant?  Oh, slim to none.  I don't think we can't even answer any phones today because our listeners are just abusing us. 
[00:19:30]  Are they?  Yeah, they're like, who wants to see your ugly mugs?  I agree.  Of course.  No, we want to see, okay, the St. Pat's pictures are under his icon now.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Let's see now.  I will see you back in the studio.  Okay.  Roger, log off of this.  Then we will log back on in the studio.  Okay.  No, this is good, right?  No, this is great on the air.  Yeah, this is great radio.  Great, great. 
[00:20:00]  I'll see you in a couple.  All right.  And there's going to be more of this until we get the pictures up on our underground website.  Because the pictures that are on the WNEW website, no one wants to see.  It's Ant and I in front of an NEW banner.  You get a picture of George Killian, a couple shots of the crowd really drunk, and a bunch  of the girls that ended up getting naked later on fully clothed.  So, here comes Ant back down the hall, I think.  Ant, hurry up. 
[00:20:30]  Here comes Ant.  Anthony.  Let's just waste valuable air time trying to figure this out today.  Okay.  There shouldn't be anything to have had to figure out.  All right.  Roger's back in the studio.  Now, Roger, don't curse.  Yeah.  There'll be no cursing.  Okay.  All right.  Let's try this.  Now, Roger is logging on. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Logging on to my computer.  All right.  With his name and password.  Yes.  That's okay if it takes time.  No, no, no.  That won't work.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Opening.  Opening.  Opening.  Where are you?  Right there.  Okay.  There they are.  You got the pictures.  Let's see if I can drag them onto my little desktop.  Okay.  Yes, they are copying to my computer. 
[00:21:30]  There you go.  No, really, this is great.  So, now it's going to take another half hour to get them up on the underground website.  Yeah.  But eventually, if you want to see the pictures from our live broadcast from LeBar about yesterday,  they will be in the section semi-live studio cam in the Opie and Anthony section.  Yes.  Don't get confused because when you go on the WNEW website, you're going to see the PG pictures proudly displayed right on the main page there. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  There's going to be an icon.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, boring.  No, we want the good stuff, the meat.  Right.  Yeah.  So, after you look at those pictures and you fall asleep, then go to the Opie and Anthony section and look for the semi-live studio cam.  There's one picture up there already, and eventually we'll have about 20 or 30 up there, okay?  All right.  I have them all.  All right.  And it's going to get to work.  All right.  Let's log off of Roger's.  Okay.  Back on to mine, and we're in business. 
[00:22:30]  There you go.  Thank you, Roger.  Thank you, Roger.  You're very welcome.  All right.  Any curses you want to throw out on the air or anything?  You want to throw one more curse our way?  No, I'm done.  Thank you.  Okay.  Very good.  You did a great job yesterday, by the way.  Okay.  The staff really did a great job yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  We couldn't have done it without them.  1027 WNAW, the rock in New York.  Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews band before that crush. 
[00:23:00]  Matthews coming to Giant Stadium May 25th.  Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m., and don't forget,  NAW has your chances at tickets all weekend long here to see Dave Matthews  starting tomorrow morning and going all weekend long.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Okay, Anthony, you've had 20 minutes.  You've found the pictures that we took from our LeBarbat appearance yesterday.  Yeah.  Do you have a report for us, Ant?  They're awful. 
[00:23:30]  Just awful.  Well, what seems to be the problem?  There are no pictures of that little blonde monkey naked.  She was flashing everything.  She was naked for 20 straight minutes.  Guys, she's bending over in front of the firemen who are snapping pictures with their Instamatic cameras.  We have every picture of her with clothes on. 
[00:24:00]  Well, Jared from Long Island says it all on the Instant Feedback.  I just got a shot of the PG pictures, which are on the WNAW website.  There is a very good shot of her butt.  Very good shot of her butt.  Yeah, yeah.  Please tell me the blonde with the short hair gets totally nude.  How long until the good pictures are up?  Bitch.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm looking at those going,  every guy is going to want to see this girl on the site with nothing on.  She was dancing around, flipping her shirt off, her pants down. 
[00:24:30]  I see more snapshots than the paparazzi at the Oscars going off.  We don't have any of those.  We don't have any pictures of her naked.  The pictures that are on the NAW website, the PG ones,  are the ones with her the most nude out of all the pictures.  I am disgusted. 
[00:25:00]  I am in a state of disgust.  Earl, grab the mic.  Earl.  Yes.  Earl, what happened?  What happened?  Well, two things happened.  Number one.  Earl was taking the pictures last night.  Well, two things happened yesterday.  Number one.  One is there's no naked pictures.  Okay, what's the other one?  The digital camera doesn't work as quickly as a regular camera.  There's sort of a, once you snap it, there's like a 10, 20 second reset. 
[00:25:30]  Right, so you should really make sure the girl's naked before you snap, right?  Yes, but.  How come there are pictures of her dressed?  I was just, me, I was snapping that.  Like every time, there's pictures of her standing there dressed.  So you snap those, and then while the camera is waiting to redo whatever it's got to do,  she's taking her clothes off?  And then, when she puts them back on, you snap again?  I don't understand.  I put my finger on the button and just was snapping away. 
[00:26:00]  The second thing that happened was, the guys from the Yonkers fire department,  they kept smacking me in the back of the head for some reason.  And I'm like, I kept turning around, like, who is hitting me in the head?  And then the monitor fell on me.  Oh, my God.  Because there was just such a rush to the stage.  This girl's so hot.  She is so hot.  Ass you could bounce quarters off of.  She was dancing around.  She's pulling her pants.  At one point, she bent over, pulled her pants down, 
[00:26:30]  where her ass was facing the crowd, and flat.  It was like Lady Di getting out of the car.  Yeah.  And that one isn't on here.  Earl, I got to say, I'm a little disappointed.  I'm a little disappointed.  I know you're not a photographer.  I know the digital camera has its drawbacks.  But one picture of her in distress,  one picture of that cute little blonde with nothing on. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just going to cry.  Can I just cry right now?  I have the mental images in my head that if the guys listening saw these,  we'd be their new heroes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Well, we got two things.  Well, she lifts her shirt up, and she's holding her breasts and her pants.  Oh, my God.  You want me to switch to a regular camera?  Ann's going to have a heart attack.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Well, we got two things happening here.  First of all, we got that girl's phone number, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll get her down here, and we'll take the pictures.  We'll have to do the job ourselves.  Guys, all I can tell you is go to the NEW website.  Check this little girl out, and you'll freak out.  And just think she was nude.  Yeah.  She's also going to take on Tara as the hottest girl to ever appear naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  So she will be coming into the studio.  Well, unless she gave us a fake number or something.  If she's listening, please give us a call. 
[00:28:00]  You know?  Oh, my God.  I don't know if I can continue.  Ann, we do have one more shot at naked pictures of her, though.  What?  That professional photographer we were talking to a half hour ago is coming in tomorrow with the pictures he took.  Oh, he is?  With a regular camera.  Oh, God.  I hope he got some.  So if he's got good pictures, then we'll just scan them.  All right.  Okay.  Well, so you've got to keep your fingers crossed.  It could still happen, Anthony.  All right, Earl, for next time, when she's naked, snap the picture. 
[00:28:30]  Snapping away.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not snap away.  Because snapping away is with her clothes on.  That's what we wound up getting.  I'm saying when she's naked, then you snap.  Clothes on, no pics.  Clothes off, picture.  Clothes on, no picture.  Rule of thumb, I think we'll all be happier.  I am so utterly disappointed that we don't have naked pictures of this girl. 
[00:29:00]  She just, like, threw me for a loop when she was taking her clothes off last night.  We were so excited coming in today going, man.  I was going, the guys are going to freak over.  I'm pumped up for the guys listening.  I'm like, this is great.  But we don't have pictures.  Do you have any other naked pictures of the slobs or anything?  Oh, dude, the slobs.  I don't even want to insult the audience that way by putting the slobs up.  Why?  Because there's big, fat, stretch mark, booby slobs that we have pictures, totally naked pictures of. 
[00:29:30]  That must have been when Earl was snapping away.  I wasn't there.  These big old flappers.  Guts, big girls with guts on them.  Well, you got to post them as a goof.  You got to post them up as a goof and explain what they are and what we got coming.  I got 20 pictures of the same girls falling over first before we even have the, the, I will, I'll put them on, but I got to preface it by saying, guys, this isn't, uh, you know, the hot stuff. 
[00:30:00]  This isn't pretty.  Jesus Christ.  That's a goof.  You got to put them up there, though.  And I'll put a couple of those up.  Just to show everyone how sad we really are.  I wasn't there.  That's when I went to take the discs back here.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Maybe Ben took them.  God, that little blonde was so hot.  Oh, my goodness.  Laszlo from Queens.  Okay, boys, I'm beginning to think that all this talk of quality photos is just a ploy to generate WNAW web traffic. 
[00:30:30]  I could give a crap about web traffic on the site.  Oh, my God.  He's losing faith in us as well as he should.  I agree.  I don't know what to say.  But this is no ploy to get people to check out the PG pictures.  There's a couple of good ones of the blind that aren't bad.  When Anthony's about to kiss her ass, that's pretty cool.  But trust me, we don't care about web traffic. 
[00:31:00]  You know, I hate to say, but, yeah, when we used to take the pictures ourselves up,  I could pop up pictures on the website of things we had done before where I was taking the pictures.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I never missed a shot.  Well, Adam writes from Jersey, never put black girl in charge of pictures again.  Get someone who can do the job and stop rubbing our faces in it about how she was hot.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Because this is why I'm so pissed. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  It's because I knew our listeners would love looking at this girl.  Now, here's a guy that says that Earl is full of S because we just need a better digital camera.  Oh, my God.  I'm dumbfounded.  I'm flabbergasted at this point.  Every guy is sending a feedback right now, and they're just all like, yee-haw, let's see the pics.  Yeah.  Well, look at this one. 
[00:32:00]  It looks like an acid flashback.  Look at this fat slob.  Oh, my God.  Make Earl look at the fat slob.  Look at this.  Earl, as your punishment, look at that picture.  Look at that.  Oh, my goodness.  And Bill from the city, talk about boring pictures.  I know you have heard enough.  The picture of Jen looks good, though.  I noticed that she smokes Marlboro.  Yeah, there's one picture of Jen and her huge boobs.  But her eyes are closed.  We don't get to see a good picture of her face.  All right.  Her, I'll put up.  This one doesn't seem that bad. 
[00:32:30]  Which one?  This chick.  Here, let me spin this around for you.  Oh, wow.  That works.  Yeah, but...  God.  That's a little better.  So, out of the 50 pictures that were taken, we got two quality shots.  A blanket apology to all the listeners out there.  Really?  I am just as disappointed as you are, people.  We let everyone down.  Oh, my God.  So, there you go.  Everyone is just bitching at us.  And it's getting ugly on the feedback here. 
[00:33:00]  What can we say?  I agree with you.  You can say whatever you want because you're absolutely right.  So right.  But hopefully, the professional photographer that we talked to earlier, hopefully, he'll  have some shots.  I saw him snapping.  Hopefully, he got the job done.  Look, here's the blonde girl with her red-headed girlfriend.  Let me see.  Yeah, here's the shot that was taken just before she took her clothes off and started grinding  on her girlfriend. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  See?  Well, we got the shot just before it.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  That would have been a good setup shot, Anthony.  Oh, we have all the good setup shots.  Patrick from, where is he from?  Jersey.  My God, you guys got to have, you got to get her on the show naked.  I think she'll be Tara as hottest girl to ever take her clothes off on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Rick, we have a number, right?  She's a totally different body type and stuff.  You know?  She's smaller. 
[00:34:00]  But man, talk about tight and well-rounded.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  This is Mike from Hazlitt.  Hey, Mike.  Just want to let you know, I think that a black girl suffered from a little camera pre-snapulation  there.  Premature snapulation?  Premature snapulation.  That's how he steps back to his...  He was shooting too early.  You're right.  He was shooting too soon.  That's good, man.  Here's another picture that the next one...  All right, no problem.  The next one was just great.  Look at this one, Opie.  Oh, man.  There she is.  That would have been great. 
[00:34:30]  With her silken little panties.  Yeah.  And she's got her pants kind of down.  Mm-hmm.  And the next shot was her girlfriend pulling her panties down.  Right.  But we don't have that one.  No, we have this one.  We don't have that one.  We got this one to look at.  See, this is a good picture.  We have this one.  We just don't have the other one.  We don't have the good one. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, man.  You should put them up there as a tease to the guys.  I'll put them up just to show what this is.  And you know something, though?  We're going to get abused by the guys that are going to check in who haven't heard us do this break.  Mm-hmm.  And say, what the F, guys?  I went on your website and the pictures suck.  Well, now you've got to put up the pictures, the lame pictures, so people could, you know, share in our sadness, Anthony.  And we'll just put a huge disclaimer up saying this is what happened.  And then we'll say, but we have one more shot at good pictures with the professional photographer who's coming into our show. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  All right.  Rick, you've got to get on it.  Get that girl on the phone.  Yeah, we've got to talk to her today.  We've got to get her down here for a private photo shoot.  If she's in the area, we'll take some pictures today.  Yeah, if she can make it down today, sure.  This is top priority.  We'll try to get her on the phone.  All right?  All right.  All right, let's take a break.  We've got some, who cares what we've got?  I am just so disillusioned and disappointed.  It's very hard to do a show today now.  Well.  I was so psyched.  Yeah.  It's a big letdown.  When you thought you were going to get a cool birthday present and it turned out to stink. 
[00:36:00]  God.  I thought I was going to get a good Hot Wheels set.  Yeah.  Real.com, the best place to buy movies.  Anthony.  Yeah.  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I just keep punching up, like, the slobs and it's just so disturbing to me.  Well, you just got to put them up now so the listeners can abuse us.  I understand.  All right, stacker two, Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Huh?  What?  Stacker two.  Yeah, I'm going to need some.  I need some now.  I got to pick myself out of this.  I'm kind of in a depression.  I'm down.  I don't have a lot of energy right now.  Well, stacker two could give you that energy boost, Ant.  You've been taking this.  Uh, yeah, I took some today because I was feeling a little tired from, uh...  Notice I have an excuse every day why I'm taking a stacker two at this point.  First of all, I remember the first time you took it, you were a little, uh, leery of it.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  And now I find I'm taking it every day.  Well, lately.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you always have an excuse.  Well, yesterday was a long day.  I wanted to be up for the show, so I jammed a stacker two once again today.  And within an hour, I felt, uh, a boost of energy.  The day before, it's like, oh, I was playing Tomb Raider late.  I need a little stacker two.  Boost my energy the next day.  Well, that's how an addict, uh, begins.  You know?  There's always a little excuse why you gotta dip into the stuff.  You're hooked.  No, stacker two's cool.  It's, uh, it has given me an energy boost.  They also say it burns fat.  I wouldn't know that, but, uh, that's what they're claiming.  Uh, the company's located in Jersey, so you can get this stuff in two days. 
[00:37:30]  The phone number is 1-800-LITE-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-LINE.  And if you're not happy with the results, you'll get your money, uh, back.  Money back guaranteed.  Can't lose.  So, check it out for yourself, guys and girls.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, Goo Goo Dolls, Dizzy from Dizzy Up The Girl.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We definitely appreciate it.  Hey, man.  I guess we could finally start our radio show.  Yeah.  The tirade is over.  Yeah, we're trying to move on. 
[00:38:00]  Um, we'll get into it again a little later about our St. Paddy Day, uh, pictures from La Barbat.  But we must say hi to everyone we met yesterday.  Thanks for coming out and supporting us.  We all had a lot of fun out there.  Great time.  Met, uh, a lot of the, uh, firemen and police officers around New York City.  Mm-hmm.  Came in, uh, a lot of, uh, fun drunks.  Yeah.  At the bar we met.  Well, they were primed.  Yeah.  And, um, it was funny because when we were setting up the La Barbat, uh, live broadcast,  everyone was running around N.A.W. panicking, going, what do you guys got planned for this, 
[00:38:30]  you know?  Usually you got a plan.  Yeah.  But Anthony and I knew that everyone was pretty much just blown off work yesterday and getting  drunk.  It's St. Paddy's Day.  You know, what are you going to do?  So we could have planned an incredible live broadcast and no one would have cared because  they were just hammered.  Yeah.  So we just decided to go with the flow and it, uh, thank God it worked out in our favor.  We had fun with it.  Because usually it takes a couple hours before the people are a little buzzed and getting  into the show.  Mm-hmm.  We got there at 2.45 and people were just like ready to rock.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  So we'll be doing a lot more of these.  Oh, yeah.  Especially with the, uh, nicer weather coming.  Yeah.  We'll do some outdoor stuff too.  I'm trying to think where we got to hit next.  We've done Jersey.  We've done Manhattan twice now.  We've done, um, Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  What are we thinking?  Well, uh, nice weather.  We got to get to the, uh, Jersey Shore.  Well, that'll happen in the summer.  We'll do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm thinking Westchester County maybe.  Mm-hmm.  Go a little north of here.  Sure.  We could do that.  Maybe.  Mm-hmm.  Or maybe back to the island. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe Staten Island.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Keep it tuned.  We'll figure it out.  And we'll have a plan.  Yeah.  But honestly, I think yesterday's live broadcast, for the people that were there, was probably better  than the, uh, the Valentine's Day bash we threw.  Yeah.  I could see that.  You know?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see the pictures.  We'll get into that a little later.  Yeah.  Because people are begging us to try to do a show today.  I know.  All right.  We hear you guys.  How are we, uh, faring in our fine city with, uh, things falling down again? 
[00:40:00]  Uh, things falling from the sky again?  Yeah.  And Times Square.  Hmm.  A big sign?  The mayor wants to clean up Times Square, but he's not really worried how they, uh, nail  up all these new, new signs and stuff.  Yeah.  As long as it looks good.  Yeah.  I guess because of the, the high winds, uh, a sign got loose and it was teetering.  I don't know if it fell by now, but pieces of it have fallen and hit people.  It was blowing around, hitting things and knocking things off of, uh, what it was hitting.  Yeah.  And falling down on some people. 
[00:40:30]  So they have to close, uh, a hundred billion block radius.  I don't understand when something happens in Times Square, because this has happened  a lot now, um, that they have to close like 10 blocks away.  Yeah.  There's no reason you have to close, uh, up to 57th Street.  Mm-hmm.  That's ridiculous.  What's gonna, what's gonna blow over here?  Yeah.  Give me a break.  Anthony and I, when we were driving in today, we were talking about the city and how it's  a fine environment that tweeters on disaster every single day.  Please. 
[00:41:00]  You know, you, you travel around to other cities in America.  If, if there's a, a stalled out car on your, on your road on the way home, or, or if there's  like something happened like there is with Times Square today, pretty much, uh, you know,  uh, work continues to get done and people can move around and stuff and they're not really  hassled.  Right.  But New York and the surrounding area, it takes one thing to happen and, and everything's  a mess.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Everything is a mess.  You'd notice, uh, like L.A. with the, uh, when they had the riots, right? 
[00:41:30]  It didn't screw the whole city up.  Mm-mm.  It was confined to a certain area.  Could you imagine a riot in Manhattan?  Oof.  Like, it would just shut the entire place down.  Yeah.  My God, I'm in jail.  He's gotta find a cause.  Yeah, he's gotta find a good cause.  Find your son.  Right.  Hi, this is Martin Sheen for Actors Against Charlie Sheen.  We have to get rid of this menace.  Please, do something.  Oh, yeah.  I'm, I'm Martin Sheen. 
[00:42:00]  I'm Charlie Sheen's father.  I can't believe I'm still Charlie Sheen's father.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Sheen.  Aren't you protesting against shoes?  Yes, this is Martin Sheen.  I'm heading up celebrities against shoes.  Millions of innocent bugs are killed yearly by shoes.  People walking, stepping on bugs with shoes.  I will be handcuffing myself to a Buster Brown.  A jackass. 
[00:42:30]  He's another one.  You're right.  The pussy arrest.  The pussy arrest.  Because the mayor, you know, I guess, does Mr. Koch have to promote another one of his wacky TV shows?  Is this why he's doing it?  Yeah, it probably is.  Look, they've handcuffed me with Jujubee handcuffs.  Boy, these are tough and they're quite tasty.  As they put me in the wagon.  All right, fine.  But seriously, if the mayor's listening, the ex-mayor, enough with the stupid pussy high-profile arrest.  If you really believe in this cause, show up with a loaded semi-automatic and really get arrested. 
[00:43:00]  Start pimping.  Start pimping.  The mayor pimping with some hoes.  Yeah.  Get some hoes.  Pimping ain't easy.  What a joke, though.  Our whole society's a joke.  Oh, of course it is.  All right.  What do you want to play?  I don't know.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Cheap trick.  Surrender.  And hold before that, Celebrity Skin from Celebrity Skin. 
[00:43:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  I guess we got a lady, Rick, is saying on the line that is mad.  What did we do?  At the way we used the P word, Anthony.  The P word?  Pussy.  Oh.  Now, we had a meeting with Scott, the big boss man, right?  Right.  And he said we're allowed to use the word pussy if we're calling someone, like, you're a puss.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's used as a term of, you know, lack of strength. 
[00:44:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Lack of will.  Okay.  You know, that guy, he's a pussy.  Right.  You know?  As the cat term, you know?  Right.  Little.  Now, I believe we're allowed to use it.  Because we got into a little trouble with the word a few months back.  Yeah.  But if we're talking about a lady's private error and we use that word.  You can't use it in that context.  That's when he has a problem with it, right?  Right.  So, we were using the term, it was pertaining to Mayor Koch and all these high-profile celebrities that do these pussy arrests. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  Where they, you know, they have a cause, so they do something really mediocre and cute to get arrested.  Mm-hmm.  They're handcuffed with the plastic handcuffs.  Right.  And then they're pretty much let out the back door and they get a little misdemeanor charge that is usually dropped in court later on.  Yeah.  And it's like, it's no big deal.  And then the press goes nuts.  Wow, Mayor Koch got arrested with Sharpton.  Because supposedly that's what is going to happen in the near future.  Yeah.  And I just went on the air and said that if the mayor really believes in this cause, go all out and really get arrested. 
[00:45:00]  Show up with a semi-automatic or something.  Yeah.  Loaded.  And really get arrested.  You know, get thrown in the joint in Rikers or something and hang with the boys for a couple days if you really believe in the cause.  Exactly.  Not one of these pussy arrests, as we call them.  That's, I think that's acceptable.  Use of the word.  All right, so, line three.  Hi, Annie W.  Yes, hello.  Hi, what's up?  I am offended by the use of the word you just used describing the arrests that some celebrities go through. 
[00:45:30]  You're offended by the word pussy.  Why?  Yes.  Why?  Because, for one thing, it's in the afternoon.  Kids are out of school.  So?  You shouldn't be talking like that.  They can handle pussy, pussy, pussy.  No.  Well, see, that's why I'm...  I'm not talking about the private area.  I'm calling someone a pussy.  It doesn't matter.  It is used every day in our society.  When people use the F word, they're not talking about the ass either.  It's not the F word. 
[00:46:00]  No, but it's similar to it.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It's the pussy word.  I'm sorry, guys, but hundreds of people are switching over to 104.  Yeah, sure they are.  What a pussy.  I hate when people say that.  Boy, you got us.  Go switch over there.  There's some exciting radio for you.  Oh, yeah.  There's things going on over there, boy.  Yeah, I can honestly sit through that garbage.  Come on.  Matter of fact, I think it's time for the 5 o'clock fuddies, everyone. 
[00:46:30]  I think we're going to be playing a Lily Tomlin record today.  Oh, I love that one ringy dingy thing.  God, that's great.  That takes some talent playing comedy CDs.  Oh, have fun over there.  Go.  Who cares?  There you go.  Goodbye.  Do we have an update on the pictures, or do you want to talk about that next, Anthony?  I'm still chopping them, you know, and putting them up on the website.  Okay.  I got to put some commentary, because I don't want people to go to the site, see a picture 
[00:47:00]  of clothed girls, and go, hey, what happened?  Well, we'll explain what happened next, because we have a whole new audience checking us out.  Hey, Roger just handed you a beer.  Yeah.  Is that like a truce?  Truce?  Thank you, Roger.  You'll be able to see what happened.  Okay.  Scott Columbo and I have worked out a way that everybody can get the pictures in the station.  Yes, I saw you.  He came in and showed me.  Mm-hmm.  I like this.  Okay.  Very good.  We've got an alternative figured out.  It won't happen in the future, and we're set.  Although, I do take no blame, okay? 
[00:47:30]  Because this is a blameless environment.  Okay.  Thank you.  And thank you for the beer.  Thanks for the beer.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Someone also?  Hey, we...  No, I'm driving today.  Meaning the ship.  The ship.  The radio ship.  Yes.  He is captain.  We have a pair of tickets for Friday's East Semifinals, man.  NCAA.  Ah.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Everybody wants to talk about the P-Worth.  All right.  Hold on.  Tracy.  Hello?  Hi.  What's up?  Hey. 
[00:48:00]  Listen, I just want to say, that woman that just called in, she doesn't like what she's  hearing.  Turn off the radio.  Yeah, that's a novel idea, isn't it?  You know, if somebody doesn't like what they're hearing on an appliance, which a radio is, turn  it off.  Exactly.  It's amazing.  All these people, they just can't get it.  If you don't like it, turn it off.  Listen to that other WSF radio station that they were talking about that does a 5 o'clock  funny.  Mm-hmm.  And that'd be the end of it.  Yeah, that competition really scares us.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  There's some real edgy, wild stuff going on over there in the afternoon.  Please.  Please.  It's amazing.  It's amazing, guys.  We listen to you every day at work.  Thank you.  You know, driving around, you know, doing what we got to do, and you guys are great.  You keep us laughing all through the evening.  Thank you.  I appreciate it, Tracy.  All right, thanks.  All right.  Keep up the good work, guys.  Thanks.  People's lives being run by an appliance, Opie.  I know.  If you didn't like the way your blender sounded, would you just leave it on?  No, I'd throw it out the damn window.  You know, leave it on.  Call up the blender company.  Go, I can't hear anything.  The blender's too loud. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  You know what they'd say?  All right, first thing, turn it off.  Mm-hmm.  If you don't like it.  And you're really not going to get to us if you say, oh, I'm switching to such and such  station.  No, please.  Because we're pretty much competing against jukeboxes in the afternoon.  Yeah.  We know it.  That's why we're not doing mornings.  Another 10 in a row.  Right.  That's what we're competing against.  So, wow, you hurt our feelings that you turned to this certain jukebox radio station.  Please.  Hi, Jen.  How are you?  Hi.  What's going on?  All right.  What's going on?  You know what that biatch's problem was? 
[00:49:30]  What?  She probably hasn't been late in about 20 years.  She's probably all rickety down there.  That's why she doesn't want to hear that word.  Rickety.  Rickety.  You just picture, yeah, everything's creaking.  You know, like, errrr.  Oh.  Ah.  All right, Jen.  All right.  I love you guys.  You're awesome.  Oh, we love you.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  Jennifer. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, hello.  A lot of Jen's calling in today.  A lot of Jen's today.  Yes.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  I just want to start off by saying I listened to you two religiously for the past two months  now.  We are a religion, yes.  Religiously.  On the way home from work, which I'm in my car now.  Cool.  And I also wanted to say, I am so glad they're letting you use more words now.  It's ridiculous that they're so censored.  It really is.  They don't like it like the girl said before.  Shut it up.  Yeah, there you go.  It's that simple.  We're within our boundaries to use that word, how we use it.  Exactly.  I mean, everything you do, sometimes you need to use certain words. 
[00:50:30]  And I don't know how you guys do it.  Bite your tongue and not say the word you really want to say.  Oh, believe me.  Off the air, people are amazed.  They're like, how do you get on the air and speak without cursing?  Because every other word out of my mouth when I'm off the air is the F word.  I'm embarrassed sometimes.  I give you credit.  We have to sit here and you get yourself in the mindset of you're meeting your first girlfriend's  father, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've got to put yourself in that whole mindset.  Well, we'll let you in on a little show secret, though. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  When you hear a song fading and all of a sudden the mics come on and you hear us just laughing.  You're just cursing, right?  Oh, and you're sitting there going, why are they laughing so hard?  Oh, because a string of curses were just released like two seconds before the mic went on.  Sometimes they do that just to get Anthony going.  I'll just ring like, what, 10, 12 pussies together and go and pop the mics on and go,  102, 7, 11, 12, you're up in New York.  You need to release some tension, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And a lot of these people, like that woman's upset that the word pussy was used in the proper 
[00:51:30]  context on the air.  Now, meanwhile, she uses the excuse that the kids are listening.  That's what I was going to ask.  But who was listening to it?  Obviously her.  Oh, my God.  I heard a lot worse when I was in kindergarten.  Exactly.  Over her house, it's probably always like that.  Yeah, and her kids don't say it?  Come on.  Yeah.  Well, thanks, Jennifer.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good day.  People forget what school was like.  It was a lot worse than the word pussy being thrown around. 
[00:52:00]  Believe me.  Yeah.  In school.  The children are home from school.  Thank God they won't hear as many curses.  Right.  Well, we found a classic bit when we first got here.  Oh, oh.  Well, there was another lady that called us, I don't know, like the first couple weeks  where we were here at N.A.W. because we used the pussy, you know, the word, we used pussy.  Right.  And this lady had a real problem with us using it, and this lady just went nuts.  Check this out.  That's how big it is.  All right, shut up.  We'll get to you next.  It's not wimpy. 
[00:52:30]  It's big, man.  And it's big.  It's coming down the street right now, and it's going to kick your ass.  She was insane.  Yeah, I wonder if she's still listening to us.  That was from, like, the first week we were here.  Very early.  Try Priceline.com on the Internet or call toll-free 1-800-Priceline.  We love Shatner.  Who wouldn't?  Stack or two, Anthony. 
[00:53:00]  Stack or two.  Loads of energy.  You take one, 45 minutes, an hour later, you're flying.  Yeah, you get a good boost.  Lots of energy.  Opie's taking this stuff every day now.  Yeah, I am.  I saw you walking out of your house with your TV and your VCR to pawn it to buy more Stack or two.  That's how much Opie loves Stack or two.  Oh, wow.  It gives them all kinds of energy.  Yeah.  He's running away from police after committing crimes to get money for Stack or two. 
[00:53:30]  Let me tell you something about Stack or two.  If I knew about this stuff when I was in high school, I'd make lots of lunch money.  Well, I'm sure we and the people at Stack or two aren't saying to do that, Opie.  Well, it's legal.  Of course it's legal.  It's all natural.  That's right.  And it's a great boost.  Energy boost.  I must say it definitely boosts my energy.  They also say it burns fat.  I wouldn't know that.  Well, I see you fading away like crazy.  But the company is saying that.  Look at you. 
[00:54:00]  You can get this stuff in two days.  They're located in New Jersey.  And if you're not satisfied by the results, they'll give you your money back, Anthony.  Let me tell you something.  The girls that Earl snapped pictures of at the same Paddy's Day thing we were at yesterday,  the girls he actually got pictures of that were naked,  they could use the fat-burning qualities of Stack or two.  Okay.  The girls that he failed to get naked pictures of,  very skinny, very lovely girls,  probably could use the energy part of Stack or two, 
[00:54:30]  but wouldn't need the fat-burning.  Okay.  Yes.  Stack or two, everyone.  N.E.W., what do you got?  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, what's up?  Yo, who's this?  Opie?  Yeah.  Opie, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, if Mayor Koch had any real balls,  he'd drive around the city,  just completely tanked,  just get completely tanked,  and just drive around the city until the cops pull him over.  Now, that's a real arrest, right?  We're taking my car.  Oh, I'm red.  I'm not going to have any balls.  You know, it's got...  What a cluster mess. 
[00:55:00]  All right, what were you saying, dude?  What do you think?  Yeah, yeah, good, good.  It's a great idea.  Thanks.  Jesus Christ.  You just wrecked Anthony.  Did somebody just hit me on the head with a ball-peen hammer today?  Just wrecked Anthony's creative energy that was happening there.  That's all right.  You want to try it?  No, you can't try it again.  It's comedy.  Oh, my God.  Look at these girls.  All right, we're going to talk about the pictures next?  Yeah, I'm putting the blonde girl in various states of dress.  She was flashing all over.  I know.  If you weren't listening earlier, definitely stick around. 
[00:55:30]  We've got to explain what happened to our pictures from yesterday's broadcast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  That's a new band called Buck Cherry.  The song is lit up.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Mike, on the instant feedback from Elmont.  Yeah.  Elmont, Long Island.  We were talking about the pussy arrest.  Yes.  You know, like these high-profile celebrities that insist on getting arrested for their cause. 
[00:56:00]  Hi, this is Martin Sheen for the SAP.  Sap in trees.  Why are we draining these trees of their lifeblood, SAP?  It's like, come on, Martin.  And then he gets arrested.  Remember that he took a hatchet to a missile silo back in the old days when he had a cause?  That's when he had a real good cause.  I'm handcuffing myself, me, Martin Sheen, to a missile silo.  And then the 70s passed, and no nukes.  They got rid of the, you know, dangerous nuclear power plants for the most part. 
[00:56:30]  And then he's like, I can't believe it.  I'm Martin Sheen, and I'm struggling for the cause of the unfufu bug in South America.  But when these celebrities get arrested, it's a joke.  Yeah.  They handcuff them for maybe two minutes, and they walk out the back door.  The press goes nuts.  And then the charges later drops, usually.  Yeah.  You know, just to get their name in print that they're for this cause.  And we suggest, if the mayor wants to get arrested with Sharpton, that he goes out in style and really get arrested. 
[00:57:00]  Really get arrested.  Firearms.  Firearms.  Selling crack on the streets.  Right.  Pimping hoes.  Yeah, drive around drunk until they arrest you.  Get a real arrest going.  Yeah.  Not one of these, as we call it, pussy arrests.  I was driving my car.  I was drunk.  That's pretty good.  What a moron.  He could be a sitcom character.  He's trying.  I think he just probably has a new judge show out or something that he's trying to promote. 
[00:57:30]  He needs a publicity.  Anyway, getting back to Mike's instant feedback here.  I think you guys are 100% correct about these pussy arrests.  These out-of-control public relation hounds are subjecting themselves, too.  I'm a cop in Brooklyn, and I think these guys should spend some time in the correctional facility if they really want to get arrested.  I wonder what they would think if a guy named Bubba made them his bitch for the night.  Why is this always Bubba getting lucky in prison?  You ever notice that?  Yeah.  Well, I think Koch might like that.  Can you picture Sharpton on all fours? 
[00:58:00]  I wonder how they would feel like after a person shot at them just because they were a cop.  Why do I have to beat a bitch?  It's not a pleasant feeling.  I know that firsthand.  I wonder how they would feel if a guy struggles with you because he doesn't want to go back to the joint.  Then he makes the accusation that you beat him because he was a different color.  Granted, there are a few bad apples on the NYPD, but out of 38,000, I would say that there are about 37,900 good cops doing the job they were trained to do.  Great show, guys.  Keep it up.  Mike. 
[00:58:30]  There you go.  Thanks, Mike.  That's the truth, too.  All right.  Yeah.  They always arrest Sharpton and then let him out, like you said, the back door.  Put him in the joint.  Let's hear him.  Oh, my God.  I was sold for a pack of new parts.  Why do I have to beat a bitch?  That's a real arrest.  Yeah.  Keep him in there for a while so he gets seasoned and, you know, learns the role.  You like my big ass, don't you?  That's right.  Hey, Anthony, we got an exclusive for our show today. 
[00:59:00]  What do you got there?  Did you hear about the Pope?  What's wrong with the Pope?  The Pope is debuting a CD and video.  What, like a workout tape or something?  Marketing has gotten way out of hand when the Pope starts putting out CDs.  He's not looking too good these days.  No.  Remember when he was, what are you, elected Pope or appointed?  Yeah, he was the young Pope.  He was the young Pope.  And it was cool because it was like, wow, there's a young Pope in there.  And he was talking about how when he was a kid, he used to do things.  You know, he wasn't like an upstanding kid. 
[00:59:30]  Just a normal kid.  Yeah.  And it was the first time you heard of a Pope talking like a real human being.  Right.  He was racing around the world.  He was getting shot.  Yeah.  Now he's just, oh, the frail old poor Pope.  He can barely hold that big hat up now.  He's in the Popemobile and he's got to like hold on for dear life, the slightest bump.  And he's jumping around and they're like popcorn.  Do you think that's why he slouches forward because of that big hat of his?  Definitely.  Yeah.  Imagine trying to hold that big hat up.  Balance.  It's like a balance. 
[01:00:00]  It's like a seal with a bowling pin.  Trying to balance it.  You know, the head goes back and forth and forward and back.  That's what he's like trying to balance that big hat.  Oh, man.  I feel bad for him.  Well, here's the deal.  This is how the article reads in the post, too.  So, with fanfare worthy of a Spice Girls album, the Vatican yesterday unveiled Pope John Paul's first CD and music video.  Aiming to reach a greater audience, the CD produced by Vatican Radio combines the 78-year-old pontiff's spoken words and chanted prayers, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  They're expecting this to sell an S-load.  Is he going to tour the album?  I don't know.  That would be interesting.  You think he's going to go on tour?  Delzner, Vaughn, and Ruffino.  Present the Pope at the Nassau Coliseum with opening act, Hole and Marilyn Manson.  Right.  And the Pope.  I saw that going.  Cool.  I'm there.  You can get a Pope concert t-shirt. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  You know?  I smoked some dope with the Pope.  Yeah.  Yeah, rocking with the Pope.  Well, Anthony, I believe we got the first track from the Pope CD here.  Oh, cool.  I was wondering if we were going to get to hear some of this.  Well, would you like me to debut it here on our show?  Yeah.  It came in.  The Pope CD.  Yeah, the Pope CD.  I'm amazed.  You got it this fast.  That everyone's talking about.  So, let's queue it up.  Pope, I can kiss makeup. 
[01:01:30]  Can you see him?  I'll say, how are we doing tonight, New York City?  Yeah, panties being thrown up on his hat.  Like, hanging bra, hanging.  So, let's rock the roll.  We're going to rock New York City.  All right, shut up.  I want to check out the Pope song here.  Opens his robe.  He's got, like, the hairy chest.  How are we doing?  We're going to rock you. 
[01:02:00]  Big, huge Pope shoes.  Yeah.  Platform shoes.  Yeah.  Him tooling above the crowd as he jams on his guitar.  You got to love it.  The Pope.  Let me hear some.  All right, here's a song from the Pope CD.  I guess that's the chant thing we heard about, right?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen for the Pope here.  He sits alone, waiting for suggestions. 
[01:02:30]  He's openess, avoiding all the questions.  His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding.  Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?  If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, children, let me know. 
[01:03:00]  Go, Pope.  If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.  Come on, honey, tell me this.  Does Rod Stewart get royalties for this?  I don't know.  Is this the Pope trying to relate to the younger people?  I believe this is the cover song on his CD.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  He does a cover tune.  That's great.  Yeah.  I got to catch the tour.  Lollapop loser.  I think he's going to be going around.  Shut up.  I'm enjoying the song.  Yeah, it rocks.  I'll come in and before we go much further.  Give me a dime so I can call my mother.  Sing it, Pope.  If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, children, let me know. 
[01:04:00]  That's the one where everybody lights the lighters.  Yeah, I think so.  And sways back and forth to the Pope Ballad.  Well, I believe he has a rock anthem on his CD as well.  Does he?  Do you want to hear just a little bit of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, let me hear.  Okay.  But if you're a boy, make a big noise.  Baby in the street, gonna be a big man someday. 
[01:04:30]  You got your butt on your face.  You'll be disgrace.  Kicking your cat all over the place.  Yeah.  Rock and Pope.  Sing it.  We sing it.  I don't think this is the Pope, Pope.  Well, it came from the Vatican, Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  I see the return address.  Vatican, yes.  It just says Vatican, yes.  Well, good luck to the Pope.  I hope I catch him when he tours.  Okay.  I want the T-shirt and hat.  Like a baseball cap, but it's real big.  Like the big Pope hat with the Pope logo and a little visor on the front.  I'm there.  We're out of our minds today.  Hi, N.E.W.  How you doing?  All right. 
[01:05:30]  I was wondering if the next time you guys go out to a bar, are you going to try to get the Pope on the venue?  Not a bad idea, right?  I don't think so.  He plays pretty good music.  There you go.  All right, bro.  Hey, I got another thing.  Can I give it an early FU?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah, we're kind of angry today.  We might as well.  Go ahead.  How bitter we are today.  Yeah, I got an FU for the cops that shot 41 times.  I got respect for cops, but not those.  Okay.  I don't know if we got it.  That was just out of hand. 
[01:06:00]  I'm still waiting for all the info, but all right.  I wasn't there.  It's a free country, and that's what you think.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW, Cracker and Lowe.  Free before that all right now.  It's Opie and Anthony and Black Earl in the studio.  Hey, man.  We got tickets to give away to the East Semifinals NCAA Tournament?  Yep.  The Men's Eastern Conference Semifinals.  Wow, that's a hot ticket.  It's a very hot ticket.  How are we going to give them away?  Do one of any trivia. 
[01:06:30]  Want to do that?  Want to do some Opie and Anthony trivia?  But you really get it.  Only the diehards that really want to go.  Don't win just to win.  Yeah.  Because there are people that would kill for these tickets.  The only drawback is you would have to be at the station by 5 p.m. tomorrow.  To pick up the tickets?  To pick up the tickets.  Between 9 and 5 tomorrow.  All right.  We need a good Opie and Anthony trivia question.  Hmm.  We got to go back.  Delve way back.  I might have an idea, but think of something just in case. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Sorry.  I'm kind of putting pictures up on the website.  All right.  I'll make it easy for people then.  You continue working at it.  We'll talk to you next.  All right.  Well, they're up.  They're up?  Yeah.  People can start looking.  Okay.  We'll let them digest that while we give away the tickets here.  All right.  Real simple and easy.  We had a young artist come in during the summertime, and he debuted a bunch of songs on our show. 
[01:07:30]  We think he's going to be the next big thing.  How old was he?  Does anyone remember?  He's 10 years old.  No, I don't know.  He was 10 or 11 years old.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play some of his work here.  Oh, I thought you were talking about Stephen Lynch.  Oh, no.  We're going to play one of his masterpieces.  All you need to tell us is the name of this artist. 
[01:08:00]  Who is this artist?  Who is this artist?  Okay.  We'll take guesses at 212-757-1027.  Here's the song.  Who is this?  I got a song for you.  Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to part.  I'm a master of this art.  I pass a lot of air through my derriere.  No one can surpass my skill of passing gas. 
[01:08:30]  My technique of ripping parts is highly state of art.  That's great.  Wait, here comes the finale.  That's great.  And all those farts were real. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  He recorded the farts and then did the song.  Who was that for the NCAA Eastern semifinal tickets?  Let's go to the phones here.  Hi, N.E.W.  Open in.  Yeah.  Who's this?  This is Brian.  All right, Brian.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from APEC.  All right.  And you got an answer for us?  Yeah, it's Skidmark.  Skidmark.  Yes!  Skidmark, yes.  First guy gets it.  Bravo.  That's real good because we haven't played that in about seven months or so.  It's been a while.  I've been there since almost a...  Oh, come on, dude. 
[01:09:30]  You're cursed.  I was overwhelmed, man.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Listen.  You're crazy.  I asked if you could use the tickets and you said, yes, I certainly can.  Yes, Open, Anthony.  I would enjoy them greatly.  It looks like you would really enjoy it.  Okay, cool.  Hold on the line.  And go Johnny's go, I guess, huh?  All right, man.  Hopefully they'll be playing Friday.  All right.  Thanks, man.  You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Yeah, line five.  Won the ticks.  Earl.  Mr. Dirty Mouth.  I hope I got that in time.  My reflexes are a little slow today.  Yeah, a little off, huh? 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Now, the pictures are up, Anthony?  Yes.  Yes.  Now, if I hit reload, they'll be there, right?  Well, I would hope so.  Let me run through it, too, to make sure.  I was looking at them, so they shouldn't be there.  No, I don't got them.  What do you mean you don't got them?  I don't have them.  You go to NEW, right?  Yeah.  And you click on Air Staff.  All right.  Then you go to Opie and Anthony, click on our little pictures.  Right. 
[01:10:30]  Then you go to Semi-Live Studio Cam.  You read through the 800-page disclaimer.  Mm-hmm.  Then you click on Semi-Live Studio Cam.  Okay.  And a new little browser appears.  And then you'll see a link that says, here are the some...  What?  I am terrible.  Here are the some crappy pics from the St. Pat's broadcast.  Oh, here are the some.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was going to put, here are the crappy pics.  I know.  Or here are some of the crappy pics. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  You know what I mean.  Okay.  And you click on that.  All right.  And there they are.  Now, this is the deal.  These were supposed to be the R-rated, X-rated pictures from the LeBarbat broadcast from yesterday.  Right.  Let me read the captions so you can play along in your car here.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  Black Earl is no photographer.  We know that.  But for God's sake, anyone would know you don't snap the pics of the hot girl with her clothes on  and not snap when her clothes are off. 
[01:11:30]  These pictures suck.  We know that.  We'll try again with this girl real soon.  This girl is really hot, this blonde that was on the show late.  It's just something.  She's got like this little Gwen Stefani thing going on.  Yes.  Doesn't she?  She's coming in to take on Tara, looks like, as the hottest girl to ever appear naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  All right, so you go down, and the first picture, here she is, the little blonde.  Cute, huh?  She's kind of smiling, sitting at our little broadcast table.  Okay, so that's a good start. 
[01:12:00]  You're like, okay, this is going to get really good.  Opie and Anthony would never deny us flesh.  And if you've noticed the way we put pictures on the website, we usually start with the fully clothed.  It's a very nice shot of the girl.  You kind of build up the suspense.  Mm-hmm.  Right, Opie?  Sure.  Okay.  Okay, now the second picture, our intern, Kevin, who does a great job for us, is sitting there with his hands behind his back, and she is grinding and giving him a lap dance.  Lap dance.  And you see her shapely butt in this shot.  It's just beautiful.  Another great tee shot. 
[01:12:30]  Lap dance for Kevin.  Wouldn't you love to see that ass with nothing covering it?  So would we.  I'm sure black girls snap some nude pics, right?  So now you're like, okay, cool.  Yeah, I'm going to get some.  The guys wouldn't let me down.  Third picture is the blonde looking at the crowd, lifting up her t-shirt.  You see the start of her bra.  Very bottom of her bra.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And the caption says, ooh, here we go.  Here it comes.  Taking it off.  Yeah.  Next picture.  Yeah, this is, I mean, this in the right, if he was positioned right, this could have been a beautiful shot. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  But no.  No.  The picture is basically her flashing us, because we were to her right.  The crowd can't see it.  You at home can't see it.  There's a mic stand in the way of her beautiful ass.  You couldn't possibly screw this shot up more.  Right.  There is everything in the way.  It's blurry.  Mm-hmm.  And it's one of the best shots that, it could have been the best shot of her butt.  You think Black Earl was using one hand when he was taking these pictures? 
[01:13:30]  Is that why they're shaky?  Maybe he had the, well, what was he doing with the other hand?  Oh, boy.  Boy, I don't know.  Ak, ak.  All right.  And then the caption goes, that's it?  Damn it.  Come on, Earl.  Snap when she has her clothes off.  Great ass.  You would see it if the damn mic stand wasn't in front of it.  That's the truth.  Then here's another blurry picture of the real hot girl.  Yeah.  She's got her shirt pulled up over her boobs.  Her bra is still on.  Mm-hmm.  But it's blurry.  Now, a nice belly ring. 
[01:14:00]  Her pants are undone.  You see her panties a little bit.  She's starting.  And then the caption reads, no, really?  Great shot, Earl.  What is this?  An artsy-fartsy soft focus shot?  Clear and naked is all we wanted.  And then it just continues from there.  Can you believe we didn't get one naked shot of this cutie when she's naked?  Damn.  Yeah, because she was naked for like 10 or 15 minutes.  A snap when she's naked.  All right.  So then you move on and you get her lesbian friend is there and their shirts are half off. 
[01:14:30]  Her pants are down with the panties showing.  So now you're thinking, okay, the next one's got to be the money shot, right?  Yeah.  And it just goes, that's it.  End of pictures.  That's it.  End of pictures.  One naked shot.  The last shot is her with her pants down about the bottom of her butt.  Yeah.  She's got her underwear on.  Her girlfriend has got her hand kind of on her butt.  And that's it.  That's it.  And then we go on to just Slob Central.  Well, then the next picture.  Now, this is the big disappointment because there's the whole buildup.  And now you're thinking, wow, the pictures are just going to be great. 
[01:15:00]  So the next picture, instead of being the two lesbian chicks like making out and being naked.  No, you get an ugly picture of me on mic.  And then there's this drunk slob on the floor.  She's just a mess.  She fell down.  She fell down.  This is in mid-fall.  Mid-fall.  Ben the Fag's got the mic.  Her hat's falling off.  And the caption reads, think she had enough to drink. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, brother.  And then the next picture is three of the four sisters getting naked all at the same time.  He couldn't even get all four girls in.  That was the key to that bit.  The four sisters getting naked.  We got three out of the four.  Yeah.  Earl misses the shots of the little blonde, but he catches this.  You've got to be S-ing me.  And then the bottom pick, which, I mean, I should have put a disclaimer before you get  to this one.  Yeah, that's fake.  I, that's nuts.  Sasquatch. 
[01:16:00]  Wait a minute.  I didn't even take that shot.  Whatever, Earl.  I don't even have to.  You're going to defend yourself at this point.  Yeah.  I put, I don't even have to say anything about this.  What the hell was he thinking?  Now, remember, he didn't get one naked picture of the hot blonde, but he gets this mess.  I didn't take the shot.  All right.  That one I didn't take.  I don't know.  It doesn't matter at that point.  Earl, you let us down.  Even if you didn't take the shot, you delegated responsibility to somebody else who missed  the shot. 
[01:16:30]  All we needed in our listeners was one picture of the blonde naked.  That's all.  I would have been happy with one picture.  One lousy shot.  You know, all night, I'm at home going, yeah, when I get into work tomorrow, I'm going  to see that.  Yeah.  I'm going to see those pictures.  And then what happens?  Nothing.  I get clothed blonde girl.  I wonder if Earl's related to that photographer from the early 70s that missed the Sasquatch  shot.  The Bigfoot shot.  Where it's all shaky.  You two are mean.  Earl's like every guy that takes a picture of a UFO. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  It's like, can't you just get the right shot and it's in focus, it's still, and you look  and you go, there it is.  It's a flying saucer.  Opportunity of a lifetime, Earl missed the shot.  It's like, it could be a naked girl, but then it might be a bridge abutment.  So, I mean, this is in the semi-live studio cam section of the Opie and Anthony site.  Yeah.  Where, where, where.  And these pictures are not that much, they're worse than the PG pictures that the NAW website  has.  The PG pictures on the NAW website, the one with the girl straddling Kevin with her pants 
[01:17:30]  just about at the, um, the line where you might start seeing her most intimate of areas.  That's a hot pick.  Mm-hmm.  But that's, that's as far as it goes.  Well.  I saw, I want to see the, the pictures those firemen took.  Yes.  Because they were snapping when she had, she was giving full moons.  Then she pulled the front of her pants down.  Oh.  Well, we have one more shot at this because we had a professional photographer there that's  coming in tomorrow with his pictures.  Yeah.  So we're praying that he's got some, uh, shots of the blonde. 
[01:18:00]  There's, there's a couple good shots of the blonde in, in, on the WNAW website, I must  say.  Yeah.  The picture of you where you're like an inch away from her butt.  Yeah.  The thumbnail, you got to click on the thumbnail because you get a much better shot of that.  Yeah, she, uh, she definitely has a nice butt, this girl.  All right.  My goodness.  And she'll be in soon to take on Tara is, is what we're starting to hear, so.  That's what, uh, that's what we need.  All right, there you go.  All right.  Thanks.  We really captured our live broadcast. 
[01:18:30]  I'm gonna, I'm just gonna have to bring the, uh, the camera next time.  Yeah, we'll, we'll do it ourselves.  Yeah.  Look at Earl.  He's all sad.  Earl, I mean, I, you know, what, what, what are we supposed to do?  I mean, you know, we, we, we got the pictures back and, uh, this is what we got.  I'm taking pictures.  Oh, Earl.  I'm handing out stuff.  I get beat by firemen.  I get hit over the head with a monitor.  Earl, we, and the most important thing was?  A naked shot.  Thanks.  Right.  Thank you, Earl.  The naked shot.  Earl, we still love you.  You know that. 
[01:19:00]  But we're disappointed today.  That's all.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  All right.  I'm dying.  There you go.  We got to get her in here.  We will.  We promise you.  No, no.  I mean, we got her.  We will, Anthony.  I'm a stalker now for this one.  1027 WNEW.  The rug of New York.  Wallflowers and the Allman Brothers, too.  One way out.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello. 
[01:19:30]  Well, the listeners are handing it to us.  Anthony, they're, uh, they're disappointed.  They're, they feel like they've been let down by us.  I see in the, uh, instant feedback coming in, um, people a little disappointed, Opie.  They want Earl's ass.  Phew.  Take a number, y'all's from the back.  Well, yeah, a lot of people, uh, wow.  Black Earl effing socks.  As a porno photographer, that is.  John from Jersey.  Hey, guys, my six-year-old son takes better pictures. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  Yeah, a lot of people disappointed that, uh, there were no nude pictures taken of the,  the cute little blonde girl.  Yeah.  That was down at our appearance yesterday.  Uh, black Earl's a chubby chaser, obviously.  Is that true, Earl?  Because he got the great pictures of the, the fat chicks naked.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys should change Earl's name from black Earl to gay Earl.  Where's the one where, uh, Earl, as punishment, should go to the show? 
[01:20:30]  Shed with one of the beasts.  Yeah.  Where was that?  That was really funny.  But the last wildebeest, the picture of the wildebeest.  What, Earl should go to the, the shed with her?  Yeah, the woodshed with her.  Yeah.  Oh, Corky Steinbrenner could have taken better pics.  Keep the camera away from him next time.  Now, I think, Earl, I think you need to be punished.  And we're not allowed to, like, whip you anymore.  No.  I'll take a whipping.  Huh?  I'll take the whipping.  You'll take a, we're not, I don't know if we're. 
[01:21:00]  I'm, I will, I will.  I think the listeners need to, to hear that you're going to be punished for, uh, taking  these horrible shots.  But last time we had you whipped, the, the special interest groups came out of, uh, the  woodwork to defend you.  I'll take it.  How about we give you.  I will, I am, I'm going on record.  I will be willing to take a beating.  Wow.  He's so distraught.  I must say, Earl's been working with us for a long time.  Yeah.  This is the first screw-up he's ever had.  Yeah.  And, uh, I've screwed up hundreds of times. 
[01:21:30]  Anthony's screwed up a few times.  Well, he's blaming it on the camera, which I could say the digital camera doesn't have  a, uh, quick recovery time after, uh, taking a shot.  Mm-hmm.  Right, right.  Yeah, if I had, like, a regular, like, the, the quickie, boom, boom, boom, I would have  I could have gotten hundreds of clothed pictures, yeah.  Now, Earl, let's.  You give me a regular camera, uh, I'll rock.  Now, you think we could whip you without chaining you down?  Maybe the special interest groups would, would allow that?  Because people get whipped, uh, every day.  It has nothing to do with the race or anything. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know about that.  What?  I don't think that'd be very nice.  Well, we'll invite Spike down.  How about we'll give, we'll give you a couple options.  I thought this was a punishment.  Spike whipping, uh, Earl, he might like that.  Well, let's think again.  No, uh, I, I have zero threshold for pain, but I will, I'll take one for the team.  Oh, I can't be partied at this.  Why?  Come on.  I don't think anyone should get a, a, a whooping for, for, uh, anything they do around here. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, man, I'll, I remember when I was young, okay?  Yeah.  My parents used to beat the S out of me.  I used to get the strap.  Yeah, you're just not allowed to beat your kids anymore.  No, no.  But when I did something wrong, my dad, and this is a true story, would go, all right,  son, go out in the yard and get a stick.  I'm going to spank you.  We had to get our own.  What the hell is that?  We had to get our own stick to get spanked.  Now go cut me a switch.  Right.  You cut me a switch. 
[01:23:00]  So being the, the wacky guy I've always been, I'd come back in the house with a tiny little  twig.  And then my parents would laugh, and I saw them laughing, and then, then they just couldn't  spank me after that, you know?  Defuse the situation.  I defuse the situation with a tiny little twig.  I used to get the strap.  If I was, you know, I'd lay in a bed, and you're talking too much, you're supposed to  be able to say, well, get that strap.  And my father would hang it on the doorknob, like as a warning.  Yeah.  If you don't shut up, and then, boom, we'd hang it there, and you'd just kind of watch  it.  It's like, oh, God, that's the strap. 
[01:23:30]  Don't want to get that.  Did you ever get the wooden spoon?  That was later on.  That was like after, after dad left, and mom had to take over with the discipline, and it  was a joke.  You reach an age, you know, you start getting like, you're 13, 14, you do something, mom  tries to beat you, you just laugh, and like, come on, mom, cut it out.  What are you doing? </pre>
