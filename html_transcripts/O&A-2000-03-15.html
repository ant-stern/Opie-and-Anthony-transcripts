<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raunchy announcement for "Whip'em Out Wednesday," encouraging female listeners to expose their breasts.  The hosts then detailed their show plans, including the arrival of guests for a lesbian sex fantasy involving strap-ons and whipped cream, and joked about their intern, "Stinky," procuring the whipped cream. They also compared a cloned version of Stinky to another employee, "Spaz."  An 18-year-old, 400-pound caller, "Fat Kid," who'd appeared on TRL with an Opie and Anthony sign, was relentlessly teased about his weight and lack of sex life. The show then shifted to their employee, Earl, who was creating oversized VIP passes and carrying a nightstick around the office. Repeated attempts to get Earl on the air failed, prompting more jokes and speculation. Callers contributed their theories on Earl's erratic behavior, with one suggesting "deadly sperm buildup."  The hosts also discussed a setback in their syndication plans. The segment included tangents on Italian-American home décor and impressions of other personalities. A caller complained about a female coworker’s insulting comments about his weight.  The segment concluded with a female listener playing "What's in My Pants," suggestively describing her actions under her clothing.  Throughout, the show employed frequent crude and sexually explicit humor and language.


The next segment started with another "What's in My Pants?" game, where a caller, Jamie, identified a triangle. This led to a discussion of sounds made by different materials. The show then played outtakes of the hosts recording commercials for the Connecticut School of Broadcasting, filled with expletives and off-the-cuff remarks. This transitioned into an advertisement for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff, interspersed with more commentary on their struggles with commercial reads.  Listeners called in to report seeing topless women on the highway and near TRL, which segued into a discussion about a listener’s negative experience with a Pakistani car service driver, leading Anthony into offensive generalizations about Pakistanis.  Mano, an Iranian-born Pakistani guest, then appeared in the studio. The hosts engaged in highly inappropriate and offensive conversation about her physical appearance, body hair, and past relationship, culminating in Spaz and Stinky shaving her buttocks on-air.  Various callers participated, offering opinions and making crude jokes.


The following segment focused on Mano's significant body hair.  Stinky shaved Mano's buttocks on-air, saving the hair clippings.  The hosts and Chuck, Mano's husband (on the phone), discussed the hair removal process with vulgar and sexually suggestive comments.  A heated argument erupted between Mano and a caller, "Old Dirty," about Hispanic men, escalating into a shouting match that ended with Old Dirty leaving the studio. Two topless women from a club unexpectedly arrived, calming the situation. The segment concluded with discussion of the topless women and the aftermath of the argument. The hosts also promoted an upcoming broadcast from a local bar and mentioned a subway shooting earlier that day.


The final segment centered around "O.D.," a man with an intense reaction to women.  O.D., on a phone behind a glass door, interacted with female dancers simulating a prison visit, pressing their bodies against the glass. Mono, a Pakistani intern whose buttocks had previously been shaved on-air, was present, and Janna arrived hoping to interact with Mono, who rejected her advances. The segment included crude sexual references, discussions of body hair, and physical interactions between O.D. and the dancers. Callers offered comments throughout. The show ended with a "What Did We Learn" call-in segment, and the hosts promoted a St. Patrick's Day party at a club and a weight-loss supplement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, I'm Angela, the first naked broad ever on the Opie and Anthony Show, and the proud supporter of Whip'em Out Wednesday, right here on 1027 WNEW.  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass, you're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  Hey man, what's up?  It's the O&A Show on this fine Whip'em Out Wednesday. 
[00:00:30]  What is going on with these Wednesdays lately, Anthony?  Beautiful.  Thank God.  We don't want to start Whip'em Out Wednesday until like mid or late April there.  Yeah.  But every Wednesday lately is just a gorgeous day.  Beautiful day.  So I must say, ladies, please start the Whipping Out process.  For the love of God, take care of your fellow commuters on the way.  A little preview of what you're in for later on this Whip'em Out Wednesday season. 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  When we get into full force there.  But we can't let a nice day like today go by without encouraging the ladies to flash their fight.  Who, who, who, who, who there's?  It just proves that God endorses Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Because he's given us these beautiful Wednesdays a couple of weeks in a row.  And you wouldn't want to get God angry at you, would you, ladies?  So start flashing the boobage on the way home.  Okay.  Well, that's one thing we're doing today.  Yeah.  And I think that's about it. 
[00:01:30]  The rest of the show we'll pull out of our ass.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  As we go.  I don't know.  We have a couple of things planned.  What are they, Ant?  Well, I think there's a couple of girls coming in.  Okay, good.  Very good.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, we got a couple of lesbian fantasies happening today.  If that pans out.  Lesbians with strap-ons.  Strap-ons.  Ooh.  That's all you need to know.  And whipped cream.  I saw that Stinky had to run out and get whipped cream.  Yeah.  For today's fantasy. 
[00:02:00]  So that's always good.  One of the intern-type duties here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Go out and get whipped cream.  And coffee.  Does it work still, the whipped cream?  Or has all the nitrous oxide been sucked out of it by now with Psycho Mark back there?  No one's Stinky.  We better make sure it still works.  He looks wrecked.  Nitrous.  Ben goes, he looks wrecked.  That's how he always looks.  Yeah.  He's the clone of Spaz.  What do you expect?  Clone.  They're cloning what? 
[00:02:30]  Pigs?  Yeah.  Oh, we've already cloned humans on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We got our own Spaz collection.  This one we call Stinky.  Or Spaz 2.  Spaz 2.  Yeah.  We already cloned humans.  That's old news to the O&A show.  I swear, you see them side to side, you would be convinced of that.  We just changed the recessive gene to a dominant gene.  Changed his hair color.  Changed his hair color a little bit.  That's all.  We just shuffled around a few genes and gave him dark hair instead of red hair. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  But don't let it fool you.  The intelligence level has not been tampered with.  All right.  Well, where do you want to start today?  We definitely got to go to the phones right away here.  Hey, Mike, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, Mike.  Hey.  I was on TRL yesterday with the wild sign.  That was you?  Are you the fat kid?  Yeah.  Well, come on down to the station.  We got some prizes for you.  Oh, I live in Jersey.  When can I come down?  Well, you have an invitation to show up whenever you want. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  This is the deal.  If you get on TV with a wow sign or you get on TV with any sign related to the Opie and  Anthony show, that gives you a free invite into the studio.  All right.  Sounds good.  To check out the show.  And then you leave with some great prizes as well.  All right.  Great stuff.  So you show up whenever you want.  All right, then.  A lot of people emailed me and said they saw you, fat kid.  Yeah.  They go, hey, fat kid on TRL with wow sign.  How fat are you that everyone's calling you the fat kid?  I'm pretty big there. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah?  How big?  How big?  I'm about 400.  400 pounds?  Yeah.  And how old are you?  I'm 18.  Oh, my God, dude.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  It's in his genes, man.  I've been big all my life.  You know something, though?  It's in his genes.  If I started eating now and just ate 24 hours a day, I would never get up to 400 pounds.  It's weird, though.  I don't even eat that much.  All my friends eat more than me.  I don't know.  Then you have to work extra hard because you know something?  18 years old, what's on an 18-year-old guy's mind 24 hours a day? 
[00:04:30]  Sex.  Right.  And how much of it are you getting at 400 pounds?  You've got to be honest.  Not too much.  Right.  What, have you got some girls that are like friends with you?  Yeah, of course.  And stuff because you're the fun fat guy.  Yeah.  But that's as far as they're going.  Yep.  Oh, dude, you've got to trim down.  You're going to find yourself like in your 30s going, I blew my whole youth.  I know.  And I was fat.  How about stacker two or something, man?  Yeah, I heard about that.  I just got an email from one of our listeners. 
[00:05:00]  They've been on stacker two for eight days.  They've already lost 18 pounds.  Yeah.  I'm going to start crying for you like Richard Simmons, not because you're overweight and  it's unhealthy, but because you ain't getting no quim.  Yeah.  It's like, you've got to lose some weight.  You've got to lose because you're not getting laid.  They'll try to give me a rusty trombone.  Now, how big are your parents there?  Funny thing is, they're not big at all.  Really?  So where does it come from?  Are you adopted?  No, no.  Do you have brothers and sisters?  Yeah, they're big, too. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, how big are they?  I'm about middle.  One's a little bit bigger than me.  Whoa.  Wait, what, a brother?  Yeah.  He's bigger than you?  How much does he weigh?  Not too much bigger than me.  We look about the same, but...  Do you look like those twins that they used to show on the bikes in the Guinness Book of World  Records?  Oh, no, no, no.  Not that big.  No, I'm a little bit better.  What the hell are they?  The minibike.  The minibike.  The fat twins?  Yeah, I know about them.  No, not like that.  How old's your brother?  He's 19.  Oh, so it's just a year apart. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Do you just like hang out and go, God damn, look how fat we are?  Yeah.  When was the last time you saw your penis?  For an 18-year-old kid, that's pretty tragic.  Oh, man.  I'm dying.  You need to see your penis a lot when you're 18.  Yes, I do.  You've got to do something.  Well, I...  Was that a fart?  Well, Mike, this explains it, because a lot of people emailed us and said, hey, fat kid  on TRL with Wow Sign.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  That was me in the song.  I don't know if you saw it, though.  In a what?  Yeah, because Cisco was on, and they gave me a thong to put on, so I put it on.  I don't know if you could see it, though.  You had a thong on?  Yeah, it was over my pants, though.  It wasn't, like, just a thong.  Oh, thank God.  I wouldn't go that far.  Couldn't imagine seeing that.  Well, Mike, we definitely want to meet you.  How are we going to get you down here?  Um...  Are you able to, you know, still, you know, get into the house, or do they need one of  those trucks to take a wall down and take out with a crane?  No, I can't get out of the house.  You don't have to call SeaWorld when you want to go to the mall, right? 
[00:07:00]  No, no way.  Okay, that's good.  That's always good.  I can walk around.  I can get up there.  I don't know when, though.  Mike, I'm sure people have told you that you keep going this way.  You're at a high risk for a heart attack there.  Yeah, every day.  All right.  Do you go to doctors or anything?  They told me I could take, like, some kind of pill that'll help me out, but I don't know.  Probably fen-fen.  Your heart'll stop.  Yeah.  No, you know what you got to do?  What?  Get yourself into some kind of regimen of eating properly. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And a little exercise.  I'm getting all that McDonald's.  See, you eat McDonald's, don't you?  Yeah, a lot.  Oh, that's crazy.  I mean, you know, if you're a skinny person, it's pretty good you stop there, grab a little  bite to eat.  But if you're overweight, I wouldn't recommend that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should eat some carrots and stuff.  Yeah, have a carrot stick and maybe walk around the block or something.  I'm sure to a certain point, you can't really help yourself.  I mean, you know, it's in your genes to be a little bigger than, you know, the average  person.  But then you got to work a little harder. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, but that doesn't mean you should just, you know, throw in the towel and go to McDonald's  every day.  You know what he needs?  He needs a picture cut out of penthouse, put on a stick with a string on it, and then  he could just walk chasing it.  Yeah, that's right.  That's the motivation.  Yeah.  Like the carrot on a stick for a horse.  You have a naked chick on a stick.  Well, Mike, you come down whenever you want.  We're going to know when you're here.  All right.  You can't miss me.  All right.  And we got some great stuff for you for getting on TRL with the wow sign.  Sounds good.  All right.  We're going to let you go, Mike.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  All right.  Keep in touch, right?  All right.  Bye-bye.  There's Mike, a.k.a. 
[00:08:30]  Fat Kid.  He's got to do something.  That's terrible.  Dia's on line two.  Not sure if I'm a lesbo.  Well, not sure?  We'll talk to her next.  Yeah, we could help you out.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  You guys, I'm Thompson.  Piss me off.  Okay.  Piss me off.  Piss me off.  1027 WNEW.  Well, let me in on the joke.  What are you guys laughing at, man? 
[00:09:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got in the studio Rick, Ben, and Shikomar.  We were talking about Friday, how we're doing the little thing we're doing Friday.  Let me explain.  On Friday, Friday's our last day at night taking a vacation.  After St. Paddy's Day, yeah.  And we started a new tradition around Christmas.  You know, the day before we go away on a big, long holiday or a vacation, we want to invite  our listeners to just have some beers with us. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Not one of these extravagant road shows that you guys know and love.  Pretty much, Ant and I just leave in the last hour of the show.  We just hang out and drink a few beers.  Finding a bar close to the studio.  Going inside.  Have nothing planned.  We throw some shirts out.  We drink a few beers, shake some hands, do some chants, and get the hell out of there,  right?  Right.  Well, we are doing that Friday.  This Friday, you know, somewhere within two blocks of the radio station.  We don't want to give out the place because we don't want a mob scene, to be honest with 
[00:10:00]  you, because then you guys are going to expect something really, really good when all it is  is us just having a few beers with you guys, okay?  So Friday around 545, we're leaving the studio to this certain location.  Right.  So Ben and I are discussing this real quick.  It's like, okay, what do we need to make sure that nobody has a problem once Friday rolls  around?  Especially the guys that work here who are going to be here until 7 and coming down and  hanging out after the show.  So you guys decided to make some type of backstage pass type of thing.  Right.  The little badges, you know, like they have for concerts, the VIP shows that you hang around 
[00:10:30]  your neck.  Sure, sure.  So, what?  I asked Earl, I said, Earl, what are you doing this afternoon?  He goes, I said, could you just work on this for me?  So now, Earl is in charge of making up our backstage passes, which are going to be laminated  and they've got to put a little thing on it.  Right.  And they're going to hang around our neck.  Everyone's seen it.  Well, let me set this up by saying those VIP backstage type passes are no more than two  inches by four inches, right?  Yeah.  That's usually what they are. 
[00:11:00]  Everyone has seen them at concerts.  All right, so that shouldn't be too hard for Earl to do, right?  All right, let's see.  So I'm printing up some stuff off the printer and by mistake, there's a sheet left on there  that I don't see, but is included with my stuff and it just happens to be Earl's draft  of the all-access pass.  Oh my God, look at it.  It's a whole sheet of paper.  It's a whole sheet of paper.  It's a whole sheet of paper.  It's an 8 1⁄2 by 11 sheet of paper.  That's bigger than my Volkswagen Hubcap medallion. 
[00:11:30]  It's as big as the Flavor Flav clock.  Are we all going to have Flavor Flav clocks around our neck?  It's a standard piece of paper that comes out of a copier.  That's how big this thing is.  Print it up.  Hanging around your neck.  Covering the entire page.  It could be a Kevlar.  Earl.  It's a shield that you could wear.  Earl, call the studio or get your ass down here.  Hey, there's another thing going on with Earl that is a little weird, a little wacky.  Last night, I'm in the office playing a little Half-Life.  Wait, wait.  I've got to interrupt you real fast. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah?  The chick that wanted to know if she was a lesbian or not, please call back.  We're going to get to you.  That's a very interesting phone call we want to get to.  All right.  She's calling back.  Go ahead, Ed.  Yes, I'm playing a little Half-Life, and a couple of people left.  Left, so it was just me in the office.  Earl comes in.  He has been carrying around a nightstick.  A frigging police nightstick for the past two days.  So he's like watching me play Half-Life right behind me with this billy club. 
[00:12:30]  And at any minute, I'm like, I know, you know, we have a pretty good relationship, me and Earl,  but is he just going to snap and cave my skull in as I'm playing this game?  He won't put the damn billy club down.  Everyone's noticed this, right?  He was doing it this morning.  He was doing it today.  I said to him, I said, Earl, this is an office.  Don't carry a billy club around.  That's his intimidation.  Now, where's Earl?  We want to talk about the billy club.  We want to talk about this huge VIP pass thing.  You've got to ask him about the van.  Oh, the van. 
[00:13:00]  We don't even want to get into that.  I've got to have one more.  Wait, wait.  What happened with the van?  Well, hold on real quick.  I just want to add a little footnote from yesterday.  Remember Earl said he was working on a press release?  Yeah.  That was sent out a month ago.  The press release he was working on yesterday was sent out a month ago.  A month ago.  Just a little footnote.  Where's Earl?  Wait, the van is the van story.  You're welcome.  What's going on with the van?  The van story is priceless, Mark.  I get a call in the office because, Ben, you call me up. 
[00:13:30]  They sent Earl down to find out what kind of van we have.  He couldn't figure out what kind of van we have.  He thought it was an infinity.  He thought it was an infinity.  An infinity van?  It only says F-O-R-D on the side of it.  It says Ford.  He's been driving the van for how long?  Maybe he's just a little distracted.  I think he's the only one that has driven that van in the last 20 years.  It's a Ford.  Line five, Earl.  Earl.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  How you doing?  Earl, why won't you come down to the studio so we can discuss this stuff?  Because I'm going to hurt somebody.  Once again, there's people talking about you, and you won't come down to the studio to...  No, I don't talk.  I don't care anymore.  There's so much tension going on.  Yeah, Earl, last night we had you on the show, but you called in.  You're only like, I don't know, 50 feet away.  Come down to the studio.  Now, first of all, Earl, why are you walking around with the Billy Club? 
[00:14:30]  Because I noticed that last night, too.  It's a little unnerving.  Yeah.  Earl?  Hey, Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Earl?  Earl?  He's there.  He's listening to us.  Earl, why are you walking around with the Billy Club?  Hey, Earl.  He's still on the line.  Mr. Volpe.  Is he?  Earl.  He's definitely on the line still.  Earl, talk.  Spaz, scare him. 
[00:15:00]  Let's just go down there.  Let's just go down there.  Psycho Mark, go run down there into his office.  Oh, my gosh.  He's going to kill him.  He's going to kill him.  Just run down.  Dude, did you see what he did yesterday?  What did he do?  Earl threw a chair and broke it.  Oh, I know.  We talked about that yesterday.  He has been so backed up.  I think it's backup of seminal fluid that is going into his brain.  Now, Earl, I know you're still on the line.  Why did you tell us you were working on a press release yesterday when the press release was released a month ago?  Yeah, hello. 
[00:15:30]  Earl.  Earl D.  I know he's there.  Earl, this is your airtime that you need.  Come on.  Yeah, come on, Earl.  Yeah.  Earl.  Mark's going to pass you by in airtime if you don't talk now.  We don't consider this airtime.  This could be a good break for a tape.  How long does it take to Psycho Mark to get into his office?  He should be there by now, no?  He should be there.  He probably locked the door.  Oh, I locked himself in.  All right.  There's another phone ringing.  Hello, hello, hello?  Earl, Mark.  Yes, guys.  Hey, Earl.  Are you on the other line still?  No. 
[00:16:00]  All right, hold on.  Are you hung up?  All right, let me hang up on that one.  All right, Earl.  Yes.  What happened?  So why are you walking around with a billy club?  I'm not walking around with a billy club.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  We all saw it.  Are you trying to intimidate us?  No, I'm not trying to intimidate anybody.  Are you trying to give us a sign that you've had it?  With the abuse lately?  All right, let's fight.  The psycho marks in there just...  Mark's going to get killed.  Earl, seriously, why are you walking around with a billy club? 
[00:16:30]  I'm not even trying to intimidate anyone.  You just like walking around with a billy club?  I enjoy the billy club.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I like the billy club.  In what way?  Do you feel oppressed or something?  No, I don't.  Don't put race into this.  Don't play the race card, Opie.  I said oppressed.  You're in the bank club!  What is psycho mark doing, Earl? 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  He took the club.  All right, Earl, we have a problem with your VIP thing you're making.  Look.  You know what I did?  It's a little big, Earl.  Well, I know it's a little big.  I had it on a file already.  How are we going to hang this around our neck?  It's as big as a regular sheet of paper.  It wasn't meant to be hung around the neck.  I had something else on file already, and I made like a rough cut of it.  Yeah.  Dude, this says lime at black.  Yeah, I made changes to it.  I was going to shrink it down and print it out. 
[00:17:30]  It's Friday's date.  Yes, I was going to shrink it down.  I was going to see what it looked like on paper.  Then shrink it down.  All right.  When can we expect the final product?  Friday?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Deal with you later, Opie.  Oh.  Well, I figure if it takes him all day to hang pictures, something like this has to take at least two days.  God damn.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:00]  He's pissed.  Ring her old bell.  He's pissed.  Tom, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Yeah, I want to talk to Earl.  I think he's losing his sanity.  I think so, too.  I mean, if you're carrying around a billy club at work.  Yeah, we stole the billy club.  We now have that in the studio.  Yeah, this is a workplace.  I mean, why is he doing this?  Yeah, I'm the right false man.  I mean, what does this guy expect?  Well, to take Earl's side, he's been taking a lot of abuse lately.  But he's working on the best radio station in the country, correct?  And the best radio show. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  So, I don't know.  I mean, he's getting paid to do this, correct?  We just like pointing out things that Earl does around WNEW.  Yeah, but he's been proud of everything he does, except this.  Right.  They're going to take him away in a straitjacket.  Well, he hung up on us, so maybe he'll call back in a little while.  I don't know.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Just a little angry.  Let's go to Manny.  Is this our Manny?  Manny, what's up?  Yo, what's up, yo?  Is it our Manny?  Yeah.  Hey, what up, man?  I haven't talked to you in a while. 
[00:19:00]  I've been listening, man.  All of a sudden, Opie turns black.  I've been listening.  Room to shine.  Did you hear the what's up, guys, yesterday?  Yeah, I heard that.  Them cats is black?  Hell yeah.  Hey, yo, you know what?  You guys get the whitest black guys ever on your show.  I know.  What's up with Chuck, Earl, uh...  Chuck Nice is as white as they come, yeah.  Earl is as white as they come.  What's up with Rudy?  Who's Rudy?  Rudy's a white guy.  Oh, Rudy's a white guy.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, Rudy's a white guy.  Man, any black people that are hired here are strictly to just fill a quota. 
[00:19:30]  So we like keeping them as white as possible.  Hey, fellas, what's up with Earl, man?  I don't know.  He's ready to snap.  He's walking around, Manny, with his billy club now.  Hey, well, let me tell you like this.  I got a child and one on the way, man.  Let me box him out his job.  You want to box him out?  Hey, yo, he don't appreciate that spot, man.  Manny, I think we might have to hire you just to have you protect us from Earl. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, man, you seen them two Jamaican cats I came there with last time, right?  Yeah, yeah, those guys are all right, man.  They'll beat some ass up.  I would believe that, yes.  My man, Earl is too soft, man.  Yeah, he's too soft, man.  All right.  But look, man, good looking.  You know, nice hollering at y'all.  Hopefully I'll see y'all soon.  I'm going to try to check y'all out this Friday, man.  Cool.  Yeah.  You know, I'm a little terrified, man.  Nah.  It's a white-black thing. 
[00:20:30]  Nah, you hang with us.  I'm going to get with Psycho Mark real quick.  It's good to have some of you brothers on stage with us.  Hey, yo, the show's been great, man.  Thanks, Manny.  I'm trying.  Hey, well, if Chuck or any of them other cats ring y'all bell, I'll personally come in there  and beat that.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  I've heard everything.  Well, Manny...  Them guys bite so much from your show, it's ridiculous.  Well, we appreciate that.  I mean, it's a good show and everything.  Yeah.  But I don't know if I'm listening to Anthony from 10 to 2 or if Anthony comes on at 2 anymore. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  I think Chuck's doing an Anthony impression.  Bill Cosby is Eddie Murphy and Anthony.  All right.  I can't reset it.  And I'll come to the studio and tell him.  I'm going to have to listen a little closer.  All right, Manny, we're going to have a beer with you Friday.  No doubt.  All right, man.  There he goes, Manny.  Interesting.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  How you doing?  Oh, good.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, I know what the problem is with Earl. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  He's got DSB.  What's DSB?  Oh, deadly sperm buildup.  You are deadly semen backup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could be.  Hey, I've seen it happen before.  And something, you've got to watch these guys, man.  They explode.  Well, we offered him a Hummer.  You know, we said we'll get him a Hummer.  Well, we didn't offer him.  Not us personally.  Not us personally, but we said we would get the job done for him.  We'd find somebody, you know.  Do you think he's gay?  I don't know.  We've asked him, but, you know, he gets very mad when we bring that up.  And he's a virgin? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Supposedly, he's a 30-year-old virgin.  Something's going on with him, man.  All right.  See you later.  Thanks, Steve.  All right.  Enough of Earl.  Vinny.  Yeah, listen.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys are great.  You guys rock.  Thanks.  I just don't understand what's up with Earl.  If he knows who he's working and who he's dealing with, if he can't handle it, he should  just go elsewhere.  Why carry a club?  It's going to make everybody else feel uncomfortable.  Yeah.  All we asked him to do is make this little VIP pass for Friday's little gig we're doing,  so, like, you know, the bar knows who's who. 
[00:22:30]  And he came back to us with a full sheet of paper, and he's going to laminate that and  make it into a big, huge VIP pass.  So what do you do?  Glue that to your chest?  I mean, you guys understand how big this is, right?  And look, it'll be hanging around her neck like this.  Like that.  It's bigger than that.  I hate you guys.  Listen, one more thing.  Hey, Vinny, you do the best imitation of, oh, gee, no, I can't remember.  Uh-uh.  All right, Vinny.  That guy. 
[00:23:00]  You sound, I mean, exactly like him.  All right.  If you don't see you guys talking, you would think it's him.  Who?  All right, the comedian there, the dirty guy.  Oh, Andrew Dice.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, that is right.  Phenomenal.  That's right on.  Phenomenal.  All right, Vinny.  You guys rock.  You're the best, and thanks for having me on.  All right, thank you, Vinny.  Take care.  You know, I say we just laminate these.  What the hell?  Would that be so funny?  Well, it looks like dorks, but it'll be pretty funny.  It's as big as a freaking license plate. 
[00:23:30]  No, you know what it'll look like?  License plate's small.  It's a piece of, like, loosely paper.  You know what it'll look like?  It's copier paper.  And look at all the stuff he writes on it.  O&A, live at St. Patrick's Day, all access.  And then the date, VIP.  You don't need all that.  It'll look like one of those, like, four-by-four shirts you wore, like, when you were 12 years old.  You had the press-on.  The iron-on patch.  Yeah, across the entire shirt.  Huge.  All right.  All right, well, maybe he's working on that as we speak. 
[00:24:00]  You know, we wasted time with Earl, and now that girl hung up again.  The girl that wants to know if she's a lesbian or not.  And what are the lesbian girls coming today for that lesbian fantasy with the whipped cream and the strappies?  They should be strolling in in the next hour.  Nice.  And I think Wayne Corbett's checking in today, Anthony.  Oh, cool.  I think he was so excited that you picked Hofstra in the tourney that he felt like he better call.  It's his old school there, his alma mater.  So we'll get him on the phone as well and lots of other things to do today.  All right?  Cool.  We'll go to the phones next.  Stay there. 
[00:24:30]  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.  Please.  Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  Opie.  He has no waiting for him.  Ah, do it.  And Anthony.  Ah, I'm just a claim in fact.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, check that out.  Yeah?  Somebody is setting up the spaz cam. 
[00:25:00]  Ah.  Looks like we're going to have some action today.  Yeah.  Some action in the studio.  Why are they putting plastic on the lesbian couch, Anthony?  Ah.  There's going to be whipped cream and other doodads.  It looks like an Italian grandmother's house in here.  With the plastic on the couch.  A little plastic on the couch.  Is that specifically Italian grandmas?  I do believe, yeah.  No?  Vick is saying no, I guess.  I think some Jewish ladies get into that, too.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely. 
[00:25:30]  You're Italian.  Some of your relatives, plastic on the couches, Anthony?  Not so much now as years ago.  But I remember going over, like, my Aunt Mary's house years ago when I was a kid.  And the living room was like a roped-off museum area.  You didn't go to the living room.  Like, the kids went to this den area that had the TV in it and an old couch that you'd sit on.  And the adults would hang out in the kitchen and sit around the table and talk.  But the living room never got used. 
[00:26:00]  And the couches were perfect.  Never sat on.  And every cushion wrapped in plastic.  And they were so square.  Like, because the corners were never sat on.  And then you had shorts on and your leg would stick to the plastic.  Dude, I wouldn't even...  I never knew because I never sat on it.  I never knew anyone that did sit on the couches.  You didn't go in the living room.  It was a known thing.  They had, like, the phonograph in there.  That never got used.  It was like a museum.  Like, you should just have a velvet rope and usher people by.  Here is the typical 1960s and 70s era Italian living room. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Here it is.  Okay.  File pass.  That's what it was.  The big, yeah, huge console TV.  And then we even had one of these.  The console phonograph, the record player, that you opened up this sarcophagus top,  half and top.  I know what you're talking about.  And inside was, like, an AM, FM radio and a record player, a phonograph. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And this big eight-track player sometimes.  That was one of the new ones.  And these huge speakers and all those elegant plastic-looking woodwork on it.  And you just raised the top.  We've come a long way.  All that technology, we can now carry on the subway with us.  That's right.  And I never understood.  I mean, it was furniture in your living room.  It's like a big furniture.  Here, there's the big wooden sarcophagus.  It's like a big coffin. 
[00:27:30]  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Talking to you.  You guys are the best.  Hey, thanks, Jay.  That plastic on the couch, definitely a Puerto Rican thing.  A Puerto Rican thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  That goes right along with all the ceramic figures underneath my grandmother's TV set.  I've been to a lot of houses in Dix Hill, so I know it's a Jewish thing.  Really?  I'm definitely an Italian thing.  When's the last time you went to Harlem?  Harlem?  Oh, I was just there.  Oh, I would have to say never. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Well, that's why you haven't seen the plastic couches.  I driven.  That's why the blood from the shootouts don't spill on the couch.  Yeah, that's a different reason.  I'd driven through Harlem by mistake a couple times, but, yeah, it's a grave error in judgment.  All right.  Thank you.  I've got syndication now.  Thank you.  Jay's saying it's a Puerto Rican thing.  Hmm.  Yeah, the syndication plans have been put on hold once again, we found out today.  Can't really get into the story, but.  We're waiting.  We've had a setback, ladies and gentlemen.  A little setback. 
[00:28:30]  There was a little light at the end of the tunnel.  I mean, the smallest little pinhole of light at the end of the tunnel.  All of a sudden, a big boulder just fell in front of it again.  Slight setback.  So.  The company is waiting for us to behave.  Yeah.  For a length of time.  For a length of time, and I was talking to one of the bigwigs in the company today.  Yeah.  Because this one person really wants our show syndicated in a big, bad way.  They want it on their station tomorrow.  Right.  So he went to the boss and the big boss and, well, the big boss, we found out, is still really pissed at us. 
[00:29:00]  And so I was talking to this guy that wants to syndicate us.  And I go, what's the problem?  He goes, well, they want you guys to behave for a while.  They're still upset about the situation.  The situation.  Anyway, so I go, what do you mean, Ed?  And I have been, you know, we haven't been in any trouble in two weeks.  And I'm on the phone in my office, dead serious, saying, hey, we've behaved for the last two weeks.  Yeah.  This is all I heard on the other end of the phone. 
[00:29:30]  So two weeks, he screams it in his office in another city and then just starts laughing uncontrollably.  And I'm like, what?  Two weeks is good for Opie and Anthony.  Well, what's the problem?  Two weeks.  And by the end of this week, it'll be three.  And then we're on vacation next week.  So.  Like a month.  So we might make a month without causing any problems.  He was laughing so freaking hard.  And I'm like, what?  I'm serious.  Yeah.  So we're going to have to kind of be good.  Not like good on the show or anything.  I mean, we could still be bad. 
[00:30:00]  But we're going to have to be good.  We just can't.  We just can't attack anyone that's associated with the company that makes more money than us.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  Or else we'll get in more trouble.  Which is pretty much everyone else in the company.  Right.  Makes more money than us.  But that's another story for another day.  And that's okay.  So the syndication thing has been put on hold again.  Oops.  Jesus, man.  We've been good for two weeks.  Always in it.  Always bad.  We are moving on from the Earl thing. 
[00:30:30]  The Earl incident.  But Dave from Dick's Hill is on the instant feedback.  Does Earl think he is Urko from the Planet of the Apes?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  With carrying around that club.  Well, we were explaining how he's walking around now with the Billy Club.  And I think he's trying to intimidate us a little bit.  Because he's been taking a lot of abuse on this radio show.  Yeah.  And Dave writes, does Earl think he is Urko from the Planet of the Apes with that club?  Oh, my God.  It's a little rough.  Remember him?  He was the big guerrilla leader of the Apes. 
[00:31:00]  He had the big leather helmet hat on.  And always carried a club.  Could someone get Earl on the phone?  I want to ask him if we could start calling him Urko if he would get insulted.  If he got insulted, then, you know, we'll pass on that one.  Earl Coe.  Urko, right?  Yeah.  Earl Coe, I think.  With an L?  No, we'll call him that.  Earl Coe.  We'll call him Earl Coe.  Yeah, that's not as bad, right?  Yeah.  Sort of incorporates his name. 
[00:31:30]  Cranky Ass from Midtown writes, Cranky Ass.  I love when these guys have creative screen names that incorporate the show.  Well, Cranky Ass checking in from Midtown.  Cranky Ass.  What about the gold baby statues in all the Italian houses?  Oh, yeah.  Andrew from River Edge, Jersey.  It's definitely not just Jews or Italians.  My grandma is Cuban slash Puerto Rican and has those damn plastic covers.  You know, it's funny.  My grandmother's house used to be like that, where the living room portion had, like, the 
[00:32:00]  plastic on the couches, and you never sat there.  You went downstairs.  Hung out down there as a kid.  And then after a while, they redid the whole house, put carpeting, like, new carpeting,  and redid the wallpaper and furniture in the living room, and opened it up to the family.  It was like they knocked down the friggin' Berlin Wall.  That's how it was.  That's how we felt.  He walked into the living room and was like, oh, look, we can sit on the couch and everything.  Freedom.  Freedom! 
[00:32:30]  Opened up the living room.  Nice.  Glenn from Queens.  Puerto Rican, Italian.  What's the difference?  Glenn.  Can we get Earl on the phone or what?  He won't pick his phone up.  He just keeps on letting Ray into his voicemail, even though he's sitting right there.  Rick, could you want to get on the cell phone and go into Earl's office?  We want to know if we'll tell him that we won't call him Black Earl anymore.  Erko's kind of a cool name.  Erko.  Erko's really hip, man.  Erko, what's up?  What's up? 
[00:33:00]  Let's go to Billy, fat guy.  Billy, what's up?  Guys, where are you when I need you?  What?  What the hell is with the radio twat?  Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  What do you mean?  What's the problem?  I'm waking up before, right, and I hear her talking about some new employee they have,  and Chucky's always goes, oh, was that that big fat ass I saw walking the halls yesterday?  What the hell's that friggin' problem?  Well, Billy, you're fat, though.  Yeah, but that gives her a right to call me a big fat ass? 
[00:33:30]  You know, take away those boobs, and she's as fired as quick as Darian O'Toole.  Oh, my God.  Billy, you sound a little pissed off.  I never did nothing to her.  My God Almighty, the only time she gets on TV is when she throws a bra.  Was there any other fat guys walking around yesterday?  Uh, duh.  I think you were the only one yesterday.  Yeah, so, I mean, like, what the hell have I ever done to that little hook-nosed Jewess?  Wow!  Wow!  You're really offended.  Why? 
[00:34:00]  What if I...  Look, guys, I'm a friend of the show.  You guys are supposed to stick up for me.  Well, we have our own problems, man.  We try to stick up for everybody.  Oh, et tu, brute?  Yeah, you're worried about a new employee.  They should have hired someone to make that damn show funny.  Oh, wow.  She would have wished I was the new employee, for God's sake.  Wow, Billy.  All right, Billy, honestly, I've got to let you go, because Rick's in a black girl's office.  Yeah, I'm going to go find the radio chick at a booth in Times Square and drop my quarter in.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:30]  Jesus, Billy.  Wow.  All right, thank you.  It's interactive radio now.  Okay, bye.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific to you, too.  Yeah, Spaz is checking in.  What's wrong, Spaz?  Earl walked out.  What do you mean, Earl walked out?  Remember last Friday?  Yeah.  Wait, Earl walked out?  Why are people walking out on our show every day?  Spaz, what do you think about Earl walking out on the show and his job when he has a responsibility to people here at the station? 
[00:35:00]  What do you think about that?  No comment.  Yeah.  Now, where's Rick?  Is he chasing him with the phone?  I think so, yeah.  Did he run out because Rick was berating him in front of people?  I think he was gone before Rick got there.  Really?  Okay, thank you, Spaz.  That proves Spaz is back with us.  Yeah.  A lot of people are really concerned about Spaz walking out on the show Friday.  Spaz walked out Friday.  And now, today, Urko walked out.  Urko?  Do you think he walked out because of the Urko remarks?  I don't know, Adam.  I hope not.  We were going to ask him if he wanted to be called. 
[00:35:30]  Keith, what's up?  It's General Urko, guys.  He was the General.  General Urko.  Yeah.  General Urko.  General Urko.  Claude Akins.  All right.  Well, we're going to see.  Was that Claude Akins?  Yeah, Claude Akins was General Urko.  That guy rocked.  That's a good piece of trivia right there.  All right.  Thank you.  Death to the humans.  All right, Keith.  Death to all humans.  That guy rocked.  Is Rick on line six?  All right.  Rick, who was sent to go find Black Earl. 
[00:36:00]  Rick, what's up?  All right, guys.  Well, General Urko is AWOL.  He cut out.  Well, what happened when you got to his office?  The office was locked.  So I finally had to call Ben down here.  Ben had a key, and we finally got in here, and everything's closed up and locked, like he's gone for the day.  But I did find a bunch of those passes he's been working on,  and Ben's just running down into the studio.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the VIP passes for Friday's little shindig we're doing?  Yeah.  It looked like he was in the process of maybe going to go put those together, 
[00:36:30]  and it's still the same freaking thing I showed you before.  Oh, boy.  Well, Errol's going to be around here somewhere, man.  He ain't back here unless I can say that.  Maybe he went to the Forbidden Zone.  Did he know you could do General Urko?  That's pretty close, man.  Do some more General Urko.  Come on.  Death to the humans.  Death to the humans.  That's pretty good, man. 
[00:37:00]  That's blasphemy.  All right, Rick.  There goes Rick.  General Urko.  He's M-I-A.  That's too bad.  We just wanted to ask him if we could start calling him that.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Remember that when they were hunting the humans down with the nets?  You know what show uses that sound?  What?  Very similar.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  When the round is over, they use their woo-hoo!  Oh, yeah.  Woo-hoo!  All right, let's go to Jamie.  Jamie, we're going to get to you next. 
[00:37:30]  Hold on, all right?  Okay.  You're berating me, Scotso.  Earl, that's okay.  I would have done the same, but I was too drunk during all those years.  Okay.  We got some new Scotso clips.  Oh, these are good, yeah.  Where are they?  We have new Scotso clips, and you remember the O Sol Amio one?  Yeah.  Where he sings and then goes...  That was actually two separate instances that were edited and put together. 
[00:38:00]  We have the complete...  Well, let's start with the original O Sol Amio, if we could.  The original original?  The original original.  Yeah, the one we've been playing.  Psycho Mark went through an old computer today and found some other little sound bites from Scotso.  Isn't that funny?  They've just been sitting in a computer.  Which one?  Yeah, okay.  This is the original, Anthony.  Oh, Sol Amio. 
[00:38:30]  The lip smacking is my favorite.  Anyway, we found the original of that.  I guess someone put that together.  This is how it really went down that day, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  B, la-da-dum.  Oh, Sol Amio.  Up yours with a meat hook. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Okay, terrific.  That's the original.  We got a couple new ones, Anthony.  We're going to put this into your machine and make it as popular as OKG.  Yeah.  This one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  There's that one again.  This one's one of my favorite.  Ready?  Really short and to the point.  Virgin. 
[00:39:30]  Virgin.  Virgin.  Wait, I'm going to start playing around with it.  Virgin.  Oh, wait.  Okay.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  All right.  All right.  You're right.  We got some new sound clips to pull around with.  God's on.  What else do we have?  Oh, yes.  Oh, you guys, this is great.  For all you old-time WNAW fans, we found in the archives, in Psycho Mark's little studio 
[00:40:00]  there, the only bit that Mr. Muni did.  The only one ever, the only bit, the only bit he's ever done.  Okay.  You want to listen to that now?  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Goodness.  Thank you, Pat.  Well, kind of a special day because the left arm and the right arm, the person that takes  care of me here at the station and tries to make me behave myself, is having a birthday,  and that's Sarah.  Sarah is the best.  And happy birthday, Sarah. 
[00:40:30]  Look at here.  What I got you.  Just look in this.  Look over here.  Look at this.  Don't make me feel bad about it.  Just come over here and get close to me.  Not everybody gets this for a birthday, you know.  And look, there's a little ribbon tied around it.  Okay, Sarah.  Happy birthday.  And come over here and sit on my lap.  Jesus.  Virgin. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  The professor.  That was a dick joke.  Oh, great.  We've got to get those into your machine so we can fool around with those, man.  Oh, yeah.  While we're at it, why don't we play the Anthony outtake?  Oh, come on.  We're going on vacation next week, so we had to do a live read for Mountain Dew. 
[00:41:30]  We love Mountain Dew, right?  Yes.  Having that huge contest with Mountain Dew where you go to www.com.  Yeah.  And pick who you think is going to be in the final four, right?  Yeah.  So annoying Psycho Mark comes into the office on a daily basis and tells us to come in and  cut some of these spots.  I see, I don't see, I don't see what was wrong with the last one we did.  Seemed to have worked.  Because the copy changes.  The copy changes.  It's the same thing. 
[00:42:00]  So Anthony really hates doing these things for some reason.  He just can't get it together in there.  Oh, yeah.  He's a genius on the air, but when it comes to reading copy, he just has all sorts of problems.  Because it's not spontaneous.  It seems put on.  So, you know, this has been going on for so long that we finally decided to take you today,  Ed.  You didn't know we were taking you.  So here's Anthony trying to read some Mountain Dew copy that we'll be running next week.  They should just run this as their spot. 
[00:42:30]  It's actually running tomorrow.  All right, here it is.  Ready?  Now what, I read?  Yeah.  Don't forget, stick your c**t in any c**t that is there, and you'll shoot your c**t and blow out her c**t uterus.  Thank you, Mountain Dew.  Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name.  You have a one in four chance to win prizes like Foot Locker discounts, Sports Illustrated subscriptions, 
[00:43:00]  and 989 NCAA video games.  Whatever that is.  What is it, 989?  989 is the c**t club.  All right, 989.  Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name.  You have a one in four chance to win a prize.  Win f**t.  Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game.  This is great.  I love doing this.  Oh, you twat.  Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name. 
[00:43:30]  You have a one in four chance to win prizes like Foot Locker discounts, Sports Illustrated...  I'm watching you laugh, you c**t.  And don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name.  You have a one in four chance to win prizes like Foot Locker discounts, Sports Illustrated  subscriptions, and 989 NCAA video games.  You collect game pieces with NCAA school names or wild names under the cap.  Wild or matching caps. 
[00:44:00]  F**t caps.  Stick them in your a**t and they feel really good.  Wild or matching caps win, right?  Is that it?  Wild or matching caps win.  Check out Mountain Dew packaging at your local retailer for details.  So stick it up your t**t.  Eat my c**t.  Yeah, not bad.  Not bad at all.  Take your 10 minutes to read 20 seconds of copy.  That's great.  Yeah.  I'm so f**king into it.  It's so relatable to me.  Eat my c**t. 
[00:44:30]  It's Casey Kasem.  Ponderous, man.  That's Casey Anthony.  How can I go for an uptempo number?  Oh my God.  Well, I got an opiate goofing on me.  As I'm reading it, Mark, I see him convulsing.  He's laughing so I'm trying not to make a sound.  Because we knew we were going to tape it and finally put it on the air.  Because it's lifeless when you have to do these things.  Well, we want to thank the fine people at Mountain Dew for giving us two minutes of material there. 
[00:45:00]  I wouldn't talk either, Pally.  There's a few tapes of you floating around that are pretty damn funny.  I can find one of those.  And I've got one over there.  You got one?  I've got one over there.  Oh, really?  Ready to go?  It's in the other room.  I've got to make sure I've edited it.  Oh, no.  Oh, get it.  Come on.  You can't totally send me down the river here.  It'll take me a couple minutes to get through it to make sure all the curses are out.  Is it me singing or something else?  No, it's just you guys trying to do a spot. 
[00:45:30]  You got one of them?  I got one.  All right, bring it in.  We'll listen to that next.  But Mountain Dew, yes, giving one of our listeners a chance to go to the Final Four,  all you have to do is go to www.com and pick who you think will be in the Final Four,  and then we're going to pick a grand prize winner.  A few thousand people have already registered,  and you have until Thursday tomorrow at noon to register for the trip, okay?  That's right, O.P.  Effing ponderous, man.  All right.  A two-two. 
[00:46:00]  Mountain Dew.  Hold on.  Let me just tell Jamie to hold on.  Jamie.  Hey, what's up?  I promise we're going to go to you right after commercials.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  All right.  And the lady who isn't sure she's a virgin, will you call back?  You keep hanging up on us.  A lesbian.  She's not sure.  Oh, she's not sure she's a lesbian.  I mean, a virgin.  She's got a problem.  No, she's not sure she's a lesbian.  Call us back.  We'll talk to you, too.  Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are lightweights. 
[00:46:30]  I can drink them both under the table.  Opie.  Boring.  Anthony.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spanning.  Yay.  Yay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  All right.  We're back.  212-757.  1027 is our phone number.  Jamie's been waiting a real long time.  We've got to talk to her, Anthony.  And Rick working on something in the other studio. 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  Giving you some ammunition today.  Very good.  Harry Sack from Hicksville checking in, Anthony.  Harry Sack?  Oh, my God.  Anthony, reading those promos are the funniest S ever.  Please put them on the website.  Ah.  Adam from Long Beach.  Be careful, guys.  Don't forget Earl is part engine, and he may pop out around the corner with full war paint.  Oh.  Oh.  A little, a little.  Thank you. 
[00:47:30]  And let's say hi to Jamie.  Jamie, you're on the radio show.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I want to play What's in My Pants.  You want to play What's in Your Pants?  Yeah.  How old are you?  22.  22?  22.  Well, we weren't going to play What's in My Pants today.  Well, but you can play it for me.  It's kind of like the Opie and Anthony J. Moore game, but I think we can have a little round here.  Sure.  Sure.  Why not?  Ready?  Well, describe yourself, first of all.  Yeah.  Well, I'm five foot.  Okay.  I weigh 105 pounds. 
[00:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  I'm very petite.  Okay.  I'm 30-60.  30-60.  I have dark hair.  Uh-huh.  Very cute.  Okay.  And where are you calling from?  I'm in Wontaw.  Wontaw.  Yes.  Are you near Mulcahy's?  I'm right down the street from there.  Yeah.  We had a great time at that road show.  I missed you guys.  All right.  And what?  You're in your bedroom, I'm assuming?  I'm in my bedroom, yes.  Are you naked?  Um, do you want me to be?  Well, what are you wearing?  Well, right now I have on, um, some running pants. 
[00:48:30]  I have some running pants.  I did not fit.  Running pants.  Yeah.  I was out biking.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day.  Running pants, what do you got on up top?  Up on top?  Yeah.  I have on a white Victoria's Secret bra.  Victoria's Secret bra, Anthony.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's take the running pants off.  All right.  You ready?  Yep.  Okay.  She's taking off her little pants, Anthony.  And you're, uh, laying on the bed there?  Yes.  All right.  And you know how to play What's in My Pants, right?  Of course.  Okay.  Very good. 
[00:49:00]  Are you ready?  Yeah, we're ready.  Okay.  Hey, what nationality are you?  Oh, God.  Hello?  Hello.  That was up and down.  That was up and down.  All right.  Let's go side to side.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Could you do a couple side to side?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Back and forth a few times.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Now up and down.  Sounds like she's raking leaves.  No, I did it side to side and then up and down.  All right.  All right.  Look.  Do a circular motion.  Okay.  A few times.  Not just one circle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  What the hell was that?  I heard some stuff in there.  All right.  And side to side again? 
[00:50:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Ed, you want to go first?  This is tough.  I'm sorry.  I need a little more.  You need some more?  Yeah.  Now, listen.  Side to side, but do it like five times.  Okay.  There you go.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Ed, it's to you.  All right.  Now, remember, Jamie, don't give your answer until we ask you for it.  I won't.  Um, Opie, um, I'm actually going to say wood floor because, no, I'm going to say that.  My ear is picking up that distinct sound.  Psycho Mark?  Psycho Mark wants to, uh...  Jiffy Pop.  You're talking Jiffy Pop.  I'm thinking Jiffy Pop.  I'm thinking massive, massive.  I'm thinking it looks like you're making Jiffy Pop popcorn in your panties.  Okay.  I'm thinking like, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, triangle, yes. 
[00:51:00]  A pull rack full of, uh, afro hair?  Sure.  Sure.  Is that what it looks like?  Yes.  All right.  Um, I guess I'm, I'm the long shot here saying a wood floor, but I think, uh, that a lot of  that sound is, is skin rubbing on the receiver, so, uh, Jamie, what indeed is in your pants?  It is a triangle.  Yeah!  Wow.  Very good.  And, and it's not well-groomed.  Yes, it is.  I don't know about that.  It is.  It sounded like you were raking leaves.  No.  I thought because of the consistency of the sound over the whole area, that was shaved. 
[00:51:30]  I think that's what it might have been.  But it's all hair.  See, that's such a fine line between, it was a complete difference.  Dude, that, that sounded like an entire forest.  Yeah, but sometimes the wood floor sounds like that because the sound is consistent.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Plus you got it side to side.  There was no, like, the wood floor is a little bit more staccato.  Oh, yeah?  Is that it?  Yeah, but you could get tricked with the wood floor if it's, uh, has a little five o'clock  shadow happening. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  The, the whole thing I was listening for was consistency.  No matter where that phone was rubbing, it made the same sound.  Wait, Mary's got a good line.  Let's go to Mary.  Mary?  Yes?  You're on with Jamie, who just played, uh, What's, What's in My Pants?  Hey, Jamie, no offense, but you sound like a horse blowing through her nose.  That's what it sounds like.  I swear to God.  Wait, that was very similar.  Wait, let's, Mary, uh, as we keep you on the line here, let's, uh, compare the two.  Jamie?  Right.  Uh, circular motions. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, circular motions again with the phone.  Wait, let's, uh, what did someone walk in your room?  Yeah.  No, now it's different.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You got...  It's the same thing.  Yeah, rub it again.  Circular motions.  There's no way she's doing the same thing.  I know.  She's not doing the same thing, Mary, because you're right on top of it. 
[00:53:00]  It does sound like, uh, we have a clip of, uh, uh, Elway.  Thank you.  It's actually John Elway.  Yeah.  All right, well, thank you for that, Mary.  You're welcome.  All right, and Jamie, thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  Yes, thank you.  You did a great, great job.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  There they go.  Fantastic.  Jamie and Mary, Anthony.  Uh, Rick, are you set to abuse me?  All right.  I took a little bit of a beating there.  Going to Mountain Dew spot. 
[00:53:30]  Seems I can't contain my, uh, vulgarities when I'm recording some of these things.  Well, it's kind of weird, because I was trying to put all the beeps in, and I do mean there's  a lot of beeps.  Yeah.  It was Anthony who, uh, again, walked away with the beep crown.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  What is this for?  This is for a Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  I thought, um, you know, when I hear those commercials on any other station, you know,  they're really professional, and they're smooth.  Hi, this is Harry Sachs for Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  You know, I'm a graduate, and you, too, could get into the wonderful world of broadcasting. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, they sound like they're broadcasters.  They sound like us.  And they don't mess up.  Okay, this could be a good one.  So, yeah, it's kind of interesting to see how Opie starts off frustrated, but Anthony  just picks up and takes off with it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I remember this one.  This one drove us nuts.  Here we go, Anthony.  More outtakes as Anthony and I try to do commercials for our radio show.  Ready yet?  Here it comes.  Hey, this is Opie.  Hey, this is Opie.  It's the new millennium.

[00:56:30]  It's not your fault you know.  It sounds fun.  I can't help it.  You should not run into me.  I can't help it if a broadcasting institute doesn't have a f*****ing sense of humor.  It's like K.Y. Jelly advertised a butt bang on Opie and Anthony.  Sorry, I don't get it.  And go f*** yourself.  Holy Jesus, did that it?  Wait, that was supposed to get Opie? 
[00:57:00]  I just got hung out to try to get it.  Like I said, it started off with Opie repeating his name.  Holy smog.  He couldn't get past his name.  We couldn't even say our names.  God, did I get creeped off that one.  We couldn't even say our names.  We're a bunch of retards, man.  And like I said, you picked up the ball and just ran with it.  Oh, my God.  There is literally five words in a row that are just un-airable.  Like, you just went bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Everyone has done that, though. 
[00:57:30]  You string the curses together nice.  Hey, we have fun.  Come on.  But this one was F-C-C-C-C and different Cs.  But back to back to back.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  All right, very good.  What happened?  What happened?  I think I have another one laying around I might have to break out.  Yeah, something where you lose it.  Because, God damn it, I don't want to seem like the only lunatic in that studio.  You lose it plenty of times.  No, I, like, stumble all over the place, but you get mad and just lose it. 
[00:58:00]  I mean, there's plenty of tape of me just stuttering like a freaking lunatic.  What?  You want to hear Opie a little crazy?  Yeah.  What do we got?  Okay.  This is when we were at a radio station that played music.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, this bastard from Jersey.  Oy, oy.  Andy Flagg writes, have you two heard of Hooked on Phonics?  You ass.  You suck.  All right.  What am I playing this? 
[00:58:30]  You're playing this.  Yeah.  Tune the best I ever did.  No way.  Tune the best that I can.  I remember these things.  When the music would be playing and we'd be coming out of a song, Opie put the headphones  on and start singing to the song.  Now, we can't hear it in here.  All you hear is Opie singing. 
[00:59:00]  So what?  Rick, turn the mic up?  I got it.  Rick just cursed.  Rick just cursed.  I used to record so much stuff in the other room.  Yeah.  Especially when he was singing.  He used to just sing like he was a bird.  Well, where is it?  That computer crashed and it took most of it with him.  I'll tell you what happened.  God damn it.  I caught on to what he was doing, so after every show, I went into the other studio and  delete, delete, delete, delete.  That's not fair.  I thought I had them all, but you got a good one there.  That's pretty funny. 
[00:59:30]  I used to have him singing Pearl Jam and Nirvana.  Let me hear that one again.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Let me hear that again.  Yeah.  I used to be a drummer, too.  Doing the best I ever did.  No way.  Doing the best that I can.  God damn, that's good.  That's pretty funny. 
[01:00:00]  That is pretty funny.  I'll take it.  That's all right, man.  I want to hear the Connecticut School of Broadcasting clip again.  Oh, come on.  That is way too funny.  All right.  We got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Find the Valentine's Day one, because you lose your mind on that one.  Topless Wow on TRL.  Can anyone confirm that?  Oh, come on.  We'll talk to Nick next.  Nick, you're on hold.  Stay there.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way. 
[01:00:30]  1027 WNEW.  Today, Diamond Vision, Dr. Philotoff.  Yes, Opie.  God himself advertising on the show again.  Yeah.  I mean, what God failed at, giving Opie correct vision, Dr. Philotoff fixed with his Diamond  Vision corrective surgery.  And this procedure.  And this topless girl is all over the tri-state area.  A ton of people are on hold.  They want to talk to us.  See, with my new eyes, now I can see these topless girls all over the highway with them squinting. 
[01:01:00]  Thank God.  My family thanks Dr. Philotoff, because I don't make the stupid squint face anymore when I'm  trying to order at McDonald's, where my tongue sticks out like I'm corky, and my eyes go like  this.  You're squinting.  Right.  Not anymore.  Don't have to do any of that.  Don't have the glasses.  Don't have to squint.  I can see boobs on the highway.  What else can I tell you about Dr. Philotoff?  The guy's done, what, over a thousand procedures, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  Including Lawrence Taylor's, Tiki Barber's, Sue Wicks, Dr. Philotoff, now calling himself 
[01:01:30]  the Doctor of the Stars, Anthony.  Doctor of the Stars.  Self-proclaimed.  That's great.  Yeah.  He's got three offices, one in Manhattan, one in Westport, and one in Greenwich, Connecticut.  And one of our listeners had the procedure done.  He won the contest, the last contest we did.  Yeah.  Happy as a clam, Anthony.  Dr. Philotoff, roaming the earth like Jesus Christ, healing people.  This guy got healed for free.  Yes.  He won the contest, which we're having another one now.  Yeah, due to an enormous response from the Valentine's Day promotion. 
[01:02:00]  Why don't we ever screw up these reads when we're doing them live on the radio?  Two, two.  Only when we get into that damn studio, we start stumbling and mumbling and cursing and stuff.  That's the problem I have when Mark comes in and says, you've got to go in the studio  and do a spot, because it's not us, it's not natural.  And they're written by the salespeople upstairs, so they try to incorporate our  zanerific on-air personas.  And it's like, hey, Opie.  Like, they write a script.  Like, we're supposed to stand there and read, hey, Opie. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, how about this?  And you're like, well, Ant, I don't know.  Perhaps a rusty trombone's in order.  They try to write in, like, everything we talk about on the show.  And it comes off sounding so phony and fake that I wind up stringing eight curses together.  We should read some of the scripts, how they wanted us to read them.  That's a good idea, too.  That could be funny, because then there was one where they said, okay, in the middle of  the spot, Anthony could play the wacky horn right here.  Okay, yeah, insert wacky horn.  Oh, yeah, that'll sound great. 
[01:03:00]  Sounds just like us on the air.  That's why I go crazy.  But, I mean, Dr. Philitoff, how could you screw this up?  It's a given.  The guy is giving people sight.  Well, he's running that promotion again, Anthony.  He wants to give the gift of sight to one of our faithful listeners.  All you have to do is contact Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitoff.  He's going to put you in the running for a complimentary vision correction and a free exam, man.  If you entered the last time, this is good news.  You'll automatically be entered in this contest, so you don't have to worry about that. 
[01:03:30]  He's got your name already.  Not everyone can afford this procedure, so this is the doctor's way of saying thank you  to the Opie and Anthony fans, all right?  Right.  All you need now is the phone number.  Very easy.  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitoff.  1-800-984-2020.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Bar with a bar.  Bar with a bar. 
[01:04:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Patiently waiting for the lesbians to show up.  Another lesbian fantasy going down, Anthony.  Yeah.  We are breaking out the Blue Tarp for the first time here in New York.  The Blue Tarp Cabaret has always been part of the O&A show.  And finally, we feel it's time to break it out here.  Breaking it out.  In New York.  Basically, you put the Blue Tarp down, get lots of food products, and have two girls go at it. 
[01:04:30]  Girls go at it on the food products on the tarp.  It's wonderful.  And we have set up the webcam, which is just stuck on my face.  Trust me, it's going to get much better than this.  But they need to focus on something until the girls get here, so.  Can't wait for that.  Hope a couple more days like this in the market, and I won't have anything left to have to give half a way of.  Yeah.  You're admitting it, that you're getting killed today? 
[01:05:00]  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Yo, Billy Baroo.  Sit down, Danny.  Well, the NASDAQ took a beating today.  I lost.  Down 123.  I lost 10 points on one stock in two days.  The Dow crank in 320.  Up 320.  Everyone dumped out of the tax and stuff today.  What happened?  Two days ago, I was in the money.  What happened?  I can't believe it.  What happened to my stock?  You're screwed. 
[01:05:30]  I kept buying when it went lower, and it just kept going low.  All right, let's talk to Nick.  See what's going on outside TRL today.  Nick, what's up?  Not much, man.  I turned on the TV, and they're showing the crowd.  Some guys hold up a black and red wild sign.  Yeah.  And right in front of them was this girl wearing a black sweatshirt.  Just a microsecond.  She lifted up his shirt.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A few people are saying that.  We can't really confirm it yet, but it seems like we might have got our first set of naked 
[01:06:00]  boobs on live TV today.  Yeah, we're out of two bald midgets.  Yeah, all right.  Well, thank you, Nick.  Okay, I'll see you guys.  All right.  Bye.  If anyone else can confirm that, that would be nice.  Carl, you're next on WNAW.  ONA.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Talking to you.  Let's go.  Carl.  Oh, my God.  You idiot.  Carl.  Well, Carl wanted to say there's topless girls on Route 17. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, I wanted to say that.  Carl?  He's laughing at us all.  There he goes.  Ah.  What a clusterf.  Jennifer, hi.  How are you today?  Good.  How are you?  Great.  You're on the radio?  Holy smoke.  Jennifer?  Oh, my God.  Okay, you're on the radio.  Am I?  Yeah.  Go.  Great.  I'm on the Atlantic City.  I'm going to Atlantic City. 
[01:07:00]  I'm on the Garden State Expressway.  And I want to wow somebody, but I don't see anybody with their sign-up.  Well, it's early in the season.  We haven't even started promoting wow.  I mean, we're encouraging you ladies to flash.  Why don't you just get some guy's attention and give them a freebie?  I know, but it's not as fun that way.  We want some signs.  Well, the signs aren't going to happen.  I mean, the signs will be out in full force in late April, mid to late April.  Can you do one just today for me?  We said that.  We said just, you know, we said to flash the guys on the highway. 
[01:07:30]  I have large breasts.  You have large breasts and no air.  Jesus.  She has large breasts and a lot of air in her head.  Obviously, a lot of the oxygen in her blood being deposited in the breasts.  Instead of steering clear of that brain area.  Instead of the old noggin. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Mike, you're next.  What's up?  Hello.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Yeah, I was watching TRL.  Yeah.  They had to go with a black sweatshirt.  I lifted up a shirt for a few minutes.  You sure?  A bunch of people calling in with that.  Yeah, positive.  All right.  What?  She was across the street?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  We might have to blow off the phones today, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  People are a little slow today.  Thank God we have some stuff happening today.  Well, let's invite Mano in here, Anthony. 
[01:08:30]  She's the Pakistani chick.  Mano.  Anthony has a problem with Pakistanians in general at this point.  Pakistanians?  I don't know.  What do you call them?  Pakistani.  Pakistani.  More than one?  Pakistani people.  Pakistani people.  Pakistanians.  Pakistanians.  Pakistan.  Pakistani.  With Pakistani people.  Pakistani people.  You made a blanket statement yesterday, and now you hate all of them. 
[01:09:00]  Well, I had such a...  That's because one did you wrong two nights ago now.  I had such a crappy night a couple of nights ago waiting for a car service to pick me up,  and a Pakistani guy finally showed up three hours late and threw me out of his car when  I got in pissed off at him.  So, yeah, I'm making a blanket statement.  I hate Pakistanis.  Okay.  They're all scum.  All right.  They all smell.  Okay.  And they're, uh, they're just, uh, they're dirt to me.  Okay.  Don't like them. 
[01:09:30]  And then we had Mono calling yesterday.  A girl who I don't believe is truly Pakistani.  And she says she could convince you to, uh, into liking her and her people.  Her mother and father, Iranian, and she was born in Pakistan.  Oh, that's not a true...  So she is Iranian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't matter where you're born.  All right.  Let's, uh, get her into the studio, man.  Let's check this out.  Hey, how you doing?  There's Mono.  Mono.  Um...  Oh, we don't have a seat for you? 
[01:10:00]  Joe, here.  Joey, move over, because we've got to get her on the webcam.  We'll put you back there.  We've got to say hi to Joey.  All right.  Joey Paisano.  Joey Paisano.  Congrats.  Brand new dad.  He's out of hiding today.  Hey, Daddy.  Guys.  How you doing there, Daddy?  Joey, here's what we put him on the radio, man.  Keep me off the air.  Keep me off the air.  I saw the new picture that you might put up instead of the Swamp Lift picture.  I'm begging you to put that one up for me.  Okay.  This is a picture of us with Jay Moore and Wayne Corbett they're going to put up in the restaurant. 
[01:10:30]  Ah, taking down the Swamp Lift pic.  Mono, grab that microphone.  We've got to sell that on eBay.  What?  The Swamp Lift picture.  We could do that.  eBay down 23 today.  Get Rick or Ben to put the webcam on Mono.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Rick.  So, what's up, Mono?  Well, I didn't like what Anthony said about Pakistani women.  But you're not Pakistani.  I am.  All right.  You're Iranian.  Mono, Mono.  My parents and...  Oh, my God.  Mono, here, here, go. 
[01:11:00]  Mono, first of all, I need some room.  Yeah, get her some...  She's crowding me.  All right, get her some...  I'm very frightened.  Get her some headphones, first of all.  Should I frisk her for a bomb or something?  And, Mono, by the smell of things in here, I'm assuming it's that time of the month.  Whoa!  Holy, holy crap!  Now, what is that fragrance you're wearing today?  What am I wearing?  Happy.  Happy, it's called?  Yeah, happy's a good scent if you put it on, like, you know, just a little bit. 
[01:11:30]  Happy.  You got a little happy with the happy, I think.  Oh, my God.  Do you normally wear that much perfume?  Yeah.  Because girls that wear a lot of perfume are usually trying to cover something up.  We just want to make sure you're not one of them.  I just took the subway here from Long Island.  You did?  Maybe someone rubbed against you.  So, we're wrong to assume that it's that time of the month?  No.  You don't have...  It is?  No, it's not.  Jesus Christ, man.  This is a guest in our studio.  I'm sorry.  Regardless of the fact that she's a Pakistani hosebag, you've got to be nice because she's 
[01:12:00]  a guest.  I just don't know when to behave.  I'm sorry.  And I don't believe you're a Pakistani hosebag because you are Iranian.  You were born in Pakistan?  What happened?  Your parents got pregnant, took a camel over the border, dropped you, and then what?  Actually, both my parents are doctors.  Wait, wait.  Are doctors?  Fix the web kit.  Yeah, but Iranian doctors.  They work with like rocks and sticks.  Now they're Pakistani.  I would consider them Pakistani.  Why would you consider them Pakistani? 
[01:12:30]  Because...  Pull that mic closer to you.  We're having a little trouble.  Mano, even though you want to have it into it.  You're having a discussion with him, but you've got to talk into the microphone so everyone  can hear you out.  So all of our listeners can hear.  Right.  Okay.  Is that better?  Yeah, but you've got to look at the mic.  It's kind of hard.  It's radio.  Don't be afraid of it.  It's not a missile coming over from Turkey.  No.  Turkish atomic bomb.  Steve from Midtown.  Now, why do Pakistanis smell so bad?  Oh, it's the men, usually. 
[01:13:00]  Because...  No, no.  I'll tell you the real reason why they smell.  It was a set up to a joke.  See, the answer was so blind people can hate them, too.  I don't think that's really the way it goes.  I've heard that joke another way myself, but yeah.  So, your parents are Iranian?  Actually, grandparents, technically.  Technically, your grandparents.  And then, where were your parents born?  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  Ah.  And then, you were born in Pakistan. 
[01:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  And they live in Pakistan, or they live here now?  Yeah.  Right now, they're living in Pakistan.  What are you doing here?  I'm married.  You're married to stay in the country?  No.  I'm married...  I actually came here to visit, and I was going to go back because I got a divorce from my ex-husband.  Ah.  Did he...  Were you a mail-order bride?  No.  No?  No.  My ex-husband is a Pakistani.  He was a scumbag.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't doubt it.  And he can't find the Hard Rock Cafe on 57th in a car, I bet, too.  I learned that the other day.  Pakistani scum. 
[01:14:00]  Did he beat you?  Yes, he did.  He beat you?  Yes.  And he was very demeaning towards you?  Yeah.  That's how Pakistanis are.  It's to make up for their very small penises, right?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's a very good line, but we have to clean it up a little bit.  Anthony?  If you will.  She said that her Pakistani man's equipment fired a little quickly.  Two and a half seconds.  Two and a half seconds.  It was all over, huh?  Oh, my God.  And then he'd be like, what are you still doing here? 
[01:14:30]  Go in the kitchen.  Cook me food now, you bitch.  You bitch.  The sick part is he's right.  All right, Mano, look into the webcam because our listeners want to get a...  Look in cam.  I beat you.  You whore.  Hold on.  No, no.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Look right into the webcam.  Look right into the webcam.  I don't know if they captured a good picture of you.  I'm looking.  Wait a minute.  And...  There we go.  Keep looking.  Keep looking.  It's called...  Keep looking.  I'm waiting for the picture to change so I can see. 
[01:15:00]  Keep looking.  Five, four, three.  All right.  I think we just captured one.  Okay.  All right.  Now get Ben to get the instant feedback.  It's going to be...  All right.  Now...  So you were married to this Pakistani guy.  Mm-hmm.  And he was abusive towards you.  Yeah.  Beat you.  How long were you married to him?  Six months.  Six months it took.  Mm-hmm.  And he had a short fuse, too.  See, I'm not wrong about this.  She's allegedly Pakistani, and she agrees with me. 
[01:15:30]  I agree with you.  Hey, it's Pakistani dice clay, whore big.  Huh?  Cook my food, you bitch.  Okay?  So he beat you, and you divorced him.  And now what?  Now you're a citizen, though?  Yeah.  Oh, that's all it took?  No, I...  There's a few bruises in the...  Well, hello, USA.  No, I got married.  I recommend that to all foreign women.  Come over here.  Get married to an abusive Pakistani.  You get a divorce. 
[01:16:00]  No, actually, the way I got my...  How many camels did you get in the settlement?  He got a car out of it, an apartment.  He got a car in an apartment, and you got nothing?  No.  How did that happen?  Because it's a dowry.  He kept all the dowry.  Oh, it's a dowry thing?  They got that wacky little thing going on like that.  Wow.  All right.  Who's your lawyer?  I'll recommend him to someone I know.  You too?  All right, go on.  It's a little joke.  That's a little joke, right.  It's a little joke! 
[01:16:30]  Well, Mano, you have big, huge boobs.  Yeah.  Those are good.  You could probably feed all of Pakistan with some breasts, right?  You should go back home and take care of your peeps.  They're living up in the mountains.  Can you unzip the top a little bit there?  Oh, yeah.  How old were you when you came here?  17.  17.  And how old are you now?  22.  22?  Wow, really?  What did you do over there?  Just kind of hang out?  Someone's got to work the webcam because this is getting interesting in the studio here.  For what? 
[01:17:00]  I'm law.  You're going to be law?  Yeah.  A lawyer?  I'm going to be a lawyer.  Not anymore?  Yeah.  I like being a Long Island housewife.  Ah.  What, are you married now again?  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  To an American guy?  Yeah.  Jewish guy.  In fact, double my age.  Really?  Yeah.  So you got yourself a sugar daddy?  Yeah.  Actually, I wasn't going to come in today.  Yeah.  He's the one who's like, please go.  Oh, really?  He's got it.  Isn't that great?  And he knows that you might be showing us some of your equipment.  If it's for somebody else, he would say definitely no. 
[01:17:30]  I said, Opie and Anthony.  He's like, go, go, go.  I don't check.  Oh, go take your clothes off.  It's fine.  Okay.  Well, that's great.  Well, let's get to the taking of the clothes off.  See, the American people are much better than Pakistani.  Much better.  So let's say, I would love to see this Pakistani body she's got on her.  Hey, Old Dirty, just checking in.  Old Dirty will help us out with the description.  Wow.  She's got, look at that, right?  Wow, she's got a couple.  That's good.  She's got a couple nuclear warheads on her chest. 
[01:18:00]  Yes, Pakistan trying to become a nuclear power.  All right.  I believe.  Wait, what kind of bra is that?  That's Victoria's Secret.  Yeah, Victoria's Secret black satin bra there.  Why is everyone coming in?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Ali, what's up?  Ali, Ali.  Ali, he's got a perfect time.  I love how people that work at N.E.W.  Wow.  Oh, look at that, huh?  Very nice.  Wow.  Wow.  Those are some nice, nice boobies.  Those are ample.  Very ample.  Let's just say. 
[01:18:30]  Very, very ample.  Those are 30...  Oh, double D.  Yeah, I would have said 36 double D.  Very nice.  Wow, I didn't expect that.  All right.  Old Dirty, what are you thinking?  I'm going to Pakistan.  Pakistan.  Wow.  She's just putting her bra in her little purse there.  Yeah.  I'm comfortable naked.  You're very comfortable naked and stuff, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  She got a big butt, too, kid.  I didn't run.  Oh.  Old Dirty likes that.  No, that's...  You got a little tat on your ankle?  Where'd you get that? 
[01:19:00]  That's a fake one.  Oh, it's fake.  I'm added to a Jewish guy who doesn't let me get a real one.  Ah, yes.  Jewish law.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't get no tats.  No, you can't get the tats.  I can get naked at Opie and Anthony's show, but you can't get a tattoo.  Yes.  Well, there's nothing in the Torah about getting naked on Opie and Anthony's show.  Hey, can we play a live round of What's in Your Pants?  Yeah.  Oh, how about that?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We don't need the phone, because we'll get the visual.  We have to decide.  We have to figure out what she has in her pants.  Without even hearing anything?  Just by looking.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, hold your arms out a minute. 
[01:19:30]  Not much hair on the arms?  No, not much hair on the arms.  You shave your arms?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one, Opie.  Okay.  Now, why do you have to shave your arms?  Is this a secret?  Give me a hair later.  You're showing me.  What is she showing?  Take it all.  She shaves everything.  Wait a minute.  She's got, like...  Dude, there's some, like, hair going down her lower back.  Wait, turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Oh, okay.  I'm willing to say.  Now, wait a minute.  I've got to ask you this. 
[01:20:00]  Mano, do you...  Do you shave your most intimate of areas?  Yeah.  You do?  Okay.  Now, um...  Wow, there's a lot of hair on that back there, Mano.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't reach back there with the razor?  My husband shaves me.  He does?  Why?  He likes hair on the back like that?  Yeah, he does.  Did you see that?  He likes that?  Something to grab onto.  Wait.  Let me ask you.  He's a sick MF.  Wait.  So, all right.  So, he shaves...  And this is coming from a girl that had a Pakistani beater for six months. 
[01:20:30]  So, she...  He shaves all the other hair off your body except for the hair on your lower back.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Let me see your arms.  Come here.  I've got to see.  When did you shave?  Look, she does.  She shaves her arms.  She's got like razor stubble.  It's like razor stubble.  I was looking at your arms going, they're remarkably unhairy.  And now it makes perfect sense.  Now she's covering up...  Oh, you don't have to cover that up.  Actually, I don't like things.  Oh, why?  Why?  Well, point the camera high, then. 
[01:21:00]  Point it high.  Get a face shot.  Don't worry about that.  No, if she doesn't want to be on the webcam, we can't force her, so...  No, because if my uncle finds out, I'm dead.  All right.  No problem.  Literally?  Literally.  Mono, we've got a head shot of you.  As long as you don't jump up and down, you'll be okay, all right?  All right.  So, we want to play What's in Your Pants.  Okay.  Can we show everyone the hairy back, though?  That's kind of cool.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Because the people on the...  Hairy back.  Pull it down a little bit.  So, we can say...  Wait.  Get some light on the hairy back.  Yeah.  Tell me. 
[01:21:30]  Hold on.  Put it down on the counter there, on the console, so you don't shake it a little bit with your  hands, Rick.  You might want to pull her panties out.  Rick.  I got first getting a tight end.  How does that look for you?  If we get a little more light on her back, it'll work much better.  You've got a hairy buffalo butt, though.  She's got a really hairy buffalo butt.  Move your hand.  Move your hand.  Does he shave your ass, too?  Like your cheeks?  No?  No.  That's perfect light right there.  Is there hair on your butt cheeks?  Two?  Really?  You haven't seen your ass in a while? 
[01:22:00]  Buffalo.  Wow.  I'm trying to look at the pictures that are popping up here, but I'm getting some kind  of an abstract Picasso thing going on.  You sure you never dated Opie like 20 years ago?  All right.  Easy.  Easy.  Old Dirty, get out of her life.  Oh, that's it.  Old Dirty, get out of her life.  Look at that.  It's perfect.  Let me see it.  Let me see what it captured.  Oh, yeah.  That's all we need.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  Oh, that's all we need.  Okay.  So that's Mano's hairy lower back.  All right.  I'm guessing, but she says she shaves. 
[01:22:30]  So I'm going to say that before shaving, it is the president of Pakistani's head in a  leg lock.  That's what I'm saying.  Just a wild refugee camp in her lap.  Well, what do you think now, though?  Now, I believe for a girl that shaves her arms, I'm going to say, and don't answer, I'm going  to say wood floor.  Wood floor.  I have to say that there's not enough hours in the day to keep the hair off this lady's 
[01:23:00]  body.  All right.  Fred Flintstone's mouth.  Fred Flintstone's mouth.  Oh, my God.  You know how he's got that perpetual five o'clock shadow?  Oh, let me think.  That's funny.  No, I got to go.  I got to go to natural.  Natural shape.  Yeah.  Triangle.  Can I try, man?  I'm going to value a guess at Robin Williams in a serious role.  Ah, the beard.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Anyone else want to guess? 
[01:23:30]  Anyone else?  Joey.  Joey.  Psycho Mark wants to guess.  I say wood floor.  He's saying wood floor.  Who said wood floor?  Psycho Mark.  Oh, Psycho Mark, wood floor, and O.D.  Don't look like peat on a feather.  It's stubbly down there.  Stubbly, but what was she?  Stubbly, but shady.  Okay.  All right.  So going for the wood floor with splinters.  Wood floor.  It looks like a wood floor with splinters.  Okay, O.D., good way to put it.  All right.  All right.  I guess, Mano, if you would let us see what you got in your pants. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  Wow, look at those big, huge breasts.  Wow, she's got tiny little black panties on her.  Before your show, turn around.  I've got to see her butt.  Yeah, there's some.  Wow.  Wow, there's some hair right on your ass.  You're sporting some hair on that ass.  He likes it that way.  Her man likes it that way.  All right.  She is out of her pants.  She's wearing a little bikini panties there.  And she's O.D.'s digging this.  I could chew off that cellulite.  I could chew off that cellulite. 
[01:24:30]  All right, Ms. Pakistan.  Let's see what you're sporting.  Okay.  It's a wood floor.  Hey!  Let me say, yeah, no, it's a wood floor.  It's got some 5 o'clock shadow, though, Anthony.  When did you have that shaved?  Two days ago.  I would say noon.  That shaved two minutes ago.  Let me see.  Turn around.  I've got to see this.  No, the other way.  I've got to see what you're sporting.  Yeah, see?  She's totally shaved. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I win.  You win, Anthony.  Now, let me tell you, riddle me this, Batman.  If you didn't shave, it would still look like you were wearing black bikini panties, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Even when you're not wearing panties, it looks like panties.  No.  Crazy hair growing on you, girl.  A grip from Jersey, Anthony.  Let me touch my head here.  Yeah?  Let me see how thick it is.  Very thick?  Well, yeah, see?  Very thick.  Very thick hair? 
[01:25:30]  Very thick.  Very thick.  Very thick.  The hair around.  Very thick.  And look at that ass.  She's got so much hair on that thing.  That's a hairy...  Chewy.  Very nice, Anthony.  A grip from Jersey.  She's a co-star with Black Girl and Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, she does have a hairy ass, R2.  Wow.  All right, Pakistan.  Very impressed with the body there, Mano. 
[01:26:00]  Thanks.  Will she grant me three wishes?  Does she come from that country?  That's all.  I don't know.  That's Baghdad.  Baghdad.  Oh, Baghdad.  Baghdad.  You don't remember the place we bombed the living crap out of a few years back?  Sure.  Well, very nice.  Would you like to have a lesbian experience?  We're breaking out the...  I'm bisexual.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Would you like to be part of the Blue Tarp Cabaret?  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Where can I find a woman?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:26:30]  She's open to everything.  Can we train you?  How about that?  Okay.  Terrific.  Well, very nice.  We've got to thank Mano for stopping by the studio.  Very impressed.  No problem.  Anytime.  That's something.  Wait.  Kenny's trying to make some kind of thought here.  Kenny, what's up?  What's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  Real good.  Big, long-time listener to the show.  Love you guys.  You're the best.  Hey, thanks.  Listen, Amano, you're from so big.  Why the hell is gas prices so high here in America? 
[01:27:00]  I have no idea.  Well, help us out.  You've got monster oil cans.  Help us out.  Oil cans.  Actually, Pakistan does not produce oil.  It's Iran that does.  Ah, Iran.  Iran.  Iran.  Iran.  Iran.  Yes.  Oh, so, you know, I was thinking, you know, you could help the guys out there, help us  out here.  Yeah, it's just way out of control.  She's got some nice hooters there, Kenny.  Does she?  I can't get her up on my webcam.  It's all shot.  I don't know what's going on.  Big and firm there, so.  Should maybe we, this guy's got a good idea on instant feedback. 
[01:27:30]  Maybe later on, have somebody run down to Dwayne Reed, grab one of those little electric  shavers, and maybe Spaz can shave her ass.  Would you allow someone to shave your ass today?  Not with an electric shaver.  No?  Why not?  Just a regular.  What?  Like a razor?  Yeah.  Like a Bic or something?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And put a little, like, cream on there?  No, I don't like cream.  No?  Just a dry shaver?  No.  You like the dry rub on that ass?  Yeah.  All right, get a Bic shaver or something. 
[01:28:00]  We should make Stinky do it.  Yeah, Stinky, the new intern.  And if he nicks you, he's got to suck the blood out.  All right, and we've got to take a break, all right?  But Mono's going to hang out.  A couple more girls showing up.  All right.  What a day.  Very impressed.  We could win another broadcasting award for this show today, I think.  We're bridging gaps.  That's what we're doing.  Bringing countries together here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be done heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I just, like, want to throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  O.D. working it with Mono, man.  Work it, O.D.  Work it!  Scott from Leviton on the instant feedback really fast here, Anthony.  I say since she's married to a Jew that she is shaving, except for the curls coming out of the sides of her panties.  All right, Anthony.

We're having a lot of fun.  Mono's still in the studio, Anthony, with Old Dirty just trying every line in the book on him.  Yeah, right, sir.  Our Pakistani's friend, Anthony.  She's a married woman.  You're right.  Oh, I'm not a married woman. 
[01:30:30]  Thirty-six double Ds, nice body, but she has a hairy back.  Someone came in with a razor, an electric razor that she approves of.  Wow, that's a good one, huh?  And we're going to have, I guess, Stinky shave her hairy ass.  Stinky's got to shave her hairy back and ass.  And ass.  Because she really has a hairy ass.  Yeah, the rest of her has no hair.  She shaves her arms.  She shaves it off.  And then she's a wood floor up front, so it's already shaved.  The hair on your arms must come in real dark that you're shaving it, huh? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a man's hands.  Like a man's hands.  Holy smockage.  All right, Stinky, get over there.  Oh, I got an idea.  I don't think Stinky should do this at all.  Me and Joey were talking, and...  I'm not shaving the chicks back.  We throw in a nice Genesis song, and maybe you can exile some of these demons.  I was never into the hairy woman thing.  I just happened to lose my virginity to a girl that had a hairy mane that went from the top of her back down the balloon knot. 
[01:31:30]  Mono, have you heard that story yet?  No.  Yeah, I lost my virginity to a girl.  She was really hot, and then I turned her over, and she had, like, a mane that went all the way down her back.  Thick. Thick.  Was it a horse?  Not a horse.  Oh, my God.  Wookie.  It was a Wookie, yeah.  So, no, I will not be shaving asses and hairy backs today. 
[01:32:00]  Well, let Stinky do it.  Yeah, let Stinky get over there.  The clone of Spaz.  All right.  He looks like Spaz's cousin is what he looks like.  No, he's a Spaz clone, yo.  They've been cloning the pigs and stuff.  We already got the human thing taken care of.  We cloned Spaz already.  Doesn't mono mean man?  Mono?  Isn't that like mono-y-mano or something?  It means a wild cat.  Mono's one.  I thought it was a disease.  Yeah.  Mono.  Who does my step on? 
[01:32:30]  Mono-nucleosis.  I got mono.  All right.  Well, we're going to have your ass exposed over here.  Maybe lean up against the wall in the frisk position.  You've got to bend completely over the chair.  Oh, over the chair.  That's a good idea.  Are we allowed to put any of this on the webcam?  As long as they don't see your face?  No.  Don't put my ass on me.  Oh, listeners love it.  Please.  No, huh?  No.  No hair, no hair yes?  I don't think it's my uncle found our dog.  He doesn't have nuclear weapons or anything, does he?  I'll tell you outside.  I can't take it. 
[01:33:00]  Alibaba.  I can't take it.  All right.  All right.  Once you get naked again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want me to get naked?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All clothing must be removed.  Yeah.  All clothing must be removed.  It's better that way.  It is better that way.  Yeah.  There's only 20 guys in the studio.  That's okay.  Usually there's only three.  I wonder why there's 20 guys in the studio.  Yeah.  You can't leave me alone.  I'm a hickey on that belly, baby.  Oh, D's digging you.  Oh, D, were you talking to him, Mike?  No one can hear this stuff.  Oh, D, talking to the mic. 
[01:33:30]  Hi, son.  What are you digging about her?  Pakistani.  He likes her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wants it.  Pakistani in the panties.  Do you have a lot of the brothers coming on to you and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're a black guy's dream.  I just had problems while trying to come upstairs.  Really?  Yeah.  You are.  You're like a black guy's dream, man.  Quickly, quickly.  You got an ample ass on you.  Call me crazy, but I think old Dirty wants to make a map of India on her stomach.  I want to do the whole pack rim on that ass. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  If you would.  Those are some really nice breasts, I must say.  Right?  Yeah.  Sure.  All right.  I know they're real.  I can tell.  All right.  You got to bend all the way over.  Lose that.  Yeah.  Lose the top.  Sure.  It's just us in here.  You don't want to get hair all over it.  Wait to shave that ass.  Chris from Belmore writes, have Spaz and Stinky each shave one ass cheek and then compare  the work they did.  Maybe we'll do that.  Yes.  That's good.  That's good.  Get Spaz in here because this is going to be funny because Spaz is Stinky's boss unofficially 
[01:34:30]  here.  Spaz, I want you to walk Stinky through the process here.  You're shaving a girl's ass and lower back.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, okay.  If you would actually take your clothes off of that chair and then turn the chair so the  back is facing the wall and now lean right over that chair so you're hanging over it. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Now, someone, Mike, someone, Mike.  No, the other way.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Like you're laying down.  Oh, okay.  Like you're laying down.  No.  Other way.  That was like looking at an eclipse.  Yeah, there you go.  Like that.  Yeah.  So you're a little more comfy.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's much better.  I don't need to look.  Just lean over.  I don't need to look at that eclipse again, man.  It was like staring at the sun too long.  Now, all right.  Hold on, Spaz.  I'm stinking.  Yeah, now you're going to have to pull the back of that thing down a little bit. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, wait, wait.  We got to expose lower back and ass.  Anthony, we got to Mike Spaz.  Just ass cheek?  No lower back?  No, my husband's going to show me.  Yeah, he likes that, huh?  All right.  They can still shave her ass.  Just ass cheek.  All right.  Give Spaz a mic.  Spaz, grab that mic.  Yeah.  Move the other mic down toward her so we can maybe get some sound here.  All right, Spaz, walk your employee through the process of shaving a girl's ass.  Shaving her ass.  Okay, now you never want to go side to side. 
[01:36:00]  So basically, you can go up or down.  It's better so you can clip the hairs up so you can catch it from underneath.  Yeah.  You get a closer shave that way because if you clip it down, you might miss, like, the root  of it.  So you just want to, like, start slowly just go up.  Up, up.  And just go, make an outer edge for you.  See, like, it's, like, coloring it between the eyes.  All right, like a coloring book.  Oh, God, just do it.  All right.  Now, do you understand where the blade is on that razor?  Yeah, that's, like, the trippy, the clippy thing. 
[01:36:30]  There you go.  No, you were doing good.  We'll go slow.  No, I think you got it.  I don't think you're using that razor properly.  No.  Spaz, get in there, man.  He's doing something wrong.  You got to put, like, a little pressure in there, right?  Don't move.  Whoa.  Don't cut it, y'all.  See?  You got to put, like, a little pressure down in there, okay?  They go back down a little bit slower.  It's like, take the fence, okay?  Take the fence.  Yes, stinky son.  Wax on, wax off. 
[01:37:00]  Head on, head off.  They are shaving Mono's ass.  Up, down.  Up, down.  No circles.  No circles.  All right.  Well, did you see that big thing in here that just came off?  Even strokes.  Very good.  Good job.  Yeah?  Now, Mono, he is getting towards...  Did you see that big clump of hair come off?  That's great, man.  Yeah, a big clump of hair just came off our ass.  Someone grab that.  We'll make a sweater. 
[01:37:30]  Now, Mono, he is getting close to maybe an erogenous zone.  I only shaved that one.  Yeah?  But, I mean, are you feeling any pleasure from the vibration of the razor?  Yeah?  Oh, Spaz, you're pulling my goddamn headphone out.  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  Well, Spaz is trying to get in there to make sure Stinky's doing the job.  Look at the hair that's coming off of that ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's good, but it is taking the hair right off. 
[01:38:00]  Get right close to a butt crack.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah, shave the station's call letters into her ass.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear that?  The razor was binding up like a lawnmower in wet, tall grass.  I think it's time to empty the bag.  Who's back?  That's good.  All right, Spaz.  All right, let me look at his work on this cheek.  Turn toward the light.  All right, let me compare.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  You can definitely tell.  It's one of those, it looks like one of those white, black cookies now.  You need, yeah, a little more.  The black and white cookies.  Sure.  You need to get it to the Walt Whitman Mall.  Yeah, there's a...  You want to do it as a gangster.  That's it.  It looks like a half moon now.  You know, you're not very economical time-wise, Stinky.  Really shave that ass.  I don't want to hurt her.  Go ahead.  You're not going to hurt her.  It's an electric razor, for Christ's sake.  Listen, if you're watching how to kick it. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, see?  Like a horse.  Yeah.  We'll whip you with a tail.  With that hair.  Pop a couple of those zits while you're at it.  Oh, man.  Oh, P, she's got half an ass to go.  You don't want to walk it out like that.  I'm sorry.  Come on.  Okay, other ass cheek.  There's no zits.  It feels good?  It's not.  Yeah.  The pock marks a couple of those.  Rub that ass, Stinky.  Rub her cheek there.  How does that feel?  Good?  Nice and jiggly.  Good.  Nice and jiggly. 
[01:39:30]  You're in for smoothness, not jiggleness.  Oh, Anthony, Bob, this just in.  Yeah.  This just in, the shaver, courtesy of shavers.com.  Oh, good.  There you go.  Everything on this show has to be part of the show.  Oh, look at that piece of hair.  Wow.  Holy crap.  There is some hair on that ass.  And Spaz is pointing at Stinky going, don't forget that spot over there.  Don't forget that.  You have to shave around your nips?  That gets hairy?  Mm-hmm.  Hold the foam.  All right, hold the razor. 
[01:40:00]  All right, hold on.  Turn this way.  Turn around.  I want to see the nipple razor stubble thing.  Okay, come here.  Let me see.  You don't see it because I shave it over again.  All right, but I'm trying to look for some stubble.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  There is that.  A hair.  Holy smoke.  Bend over again.  Stinky's almost done with his shaving here.  This is taking forever.  I don't know why the Jewish guy married him.  He's bald, but he's slugging the hair in the head.  Oh, Stinky.  Stinky's really getting in there.  Getting right in the crack there.  Right in there. 
[01:40:30]  This is hilarious, Stinky.  A little bit here, too.  Yeah, Spaz is pointing, pointing at where Stinky's.  You know what?  Yeah, just pull the G-string a little.  It's a not lower back hair.  Don't get that.  Her husband likes that low.  No, not there.  No, not there.  Just crack down.  Cracking down.  Just below the crack.  Don't go above the crack.  You'll piss off the husband.  Gives him something to hold on to.  Spaz is Stinky doing a good job down there.  Right in there, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  That's right in the action spot, isn't it?  Okay, that's it.  Don't get any closer.  Oh, yeah.  We almost got into the forbidden zone.  Damn.  She's a monkey woman.  Thank God.  You weren't throwing rocks at a shepherd the other day because he wouldn't give you water,  would you?  No.  Okay, just making sure.  Well, what else can we do?  I mean, we...  What else can we do?  Let's chop her up and put her in a 55-gallon drum.  They'll be here. 
[01:41:30]  I think the lesbian girls heard you on the radio and they're running away.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  Look at her hair.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  Okay, get a little...  Oh, my God.  Get a little vial and save that and we'll give it away as a prize.  It's the Pakistani ass hair.  We give away everything on this show.  We share with our listeners.  You know, Ann, I think if you smoke it, you'll get a good...  Yes.  Hey, dude, I got some Pakistani.  Herb, no ass hair.  All right.  They are documenting the ass hair, Anthony. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Well, it did...  Look at that.  It did take the hair right off her ass.  I am amazed.  Someone thinks you're a man.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  I think about it.  She's really hairy.  She likes women.  That's a man.  All right?  Also, you should take that hair and make a wig out of it and make Spaz wear it.  There's a lot of hair there.  Oh, yeah.  We could definitely knit a little baby sweater for Joey.  Love you guys.  Go.  Have a bear in the air, Wrangler. 
[01:42:30]  Take care.  Bye-bye.  Stop right there.  Well, I think it's your present, you had.  Leave my daughter.  We're at it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Lee.  Lee, you're next on N.E.W.  Oh, man.  Are you guys playing Let's Make the Audience Puke over there?  We were doing a public service.  That is disgusting.  We shaved her hairy ass.  Lee, you should have saw the hair flying off her ass.  I don't want to think about it, even.  It's disgusting. 
[01:43:00]  What does Chuck Hessen think about it?  I don't know.  Chuck isn't here today, Lee.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Okay, terrific.  All right, thank you.  Anything else we could shave there?  No, I think so.  You got everything.  I want to shave the back hair so bad, but your man will get pissed?  Can we get him on the line?  I'll ask him.  Can we call him up and ask him?  My husband.  Yeah, call him up and ask him.  Here, get Rick.  Rick will call him or Ben or one of the guys.  Yeah, get him on the phone.  Okay, I just dumped out of that. 
[01:43:30]  We had to dump out.  She just said where the guy works.  That wouldn't be too cool.  No.  There's 30 people on hold that heard that.  Oh, my God.  Bono, you weren't on the Discovery Channel Sunday night, were you?  The woolly mammoth.  The woolly mammoth.  She was in case of the ice.  In the ice.  That's what it was.  It was mono.  No.  She's a very nice girl.  She really is. 
[01:44:00]  She's just very hairy.  The boobs help her out, though, right, Ann?  You see, she's just topless.  She's got a very ample set of boobs and an ass to match, Sophie.  Jesus Christ.  All right, this is what we're going to have to do.  We're running late, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  Mm-hmm.  We have nothing better to do, so we're going to get Mono's husband on the line.  And see if we can shave our back hair.  Yeah, because the back hair is getting way out of control, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  So we'll be back.  Stay there. 
[01:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, Sophie.  Wow.  Boo, boo, boo.  Or stupidity on the way.  We're in the middle of commercials, but I've got to go to line nine really fast.  All right.  And say hi to Michelle.  Michelle, what's up?  Hi.  How are you, Michelle?  I just want to let you guys know that I figured out who was the gorilla holding the sign on  Channel 2 News. 
[01:45:00]  Mr. Girl, you're shaving down.  You know, back in the 80s, they used to call her a goonie-goo-goo.  Goonie-goo-goo.  Oh, I like that, Michelle.  Thank you.  She's nasty.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  You don't have to insult her.  Well, Mono, she's just hairy.  She's a nice enough girl.  Mono, you weren't the gorilla on Channel 2 two days ago, jumping up and down with a  wow sign saying, okay, terrific on live TV, right?  Definitely.  You can't confirm that?  Okay.  Thank you.  Anthony, stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes. 
[01:45:30]  It works.  You know?  You've got to lose some weight.  You've been packing on the pounds, stack or two will burn the fat off, world's strongest  fat burner.  Also, cuts down on the cravings to snack during the day, and it gives you a boost to energy.  Everything you need to lose weight with stack or two.  Isn't that right, Opie?  Yeah, I'm just, there was a subway shooting today.  I'm just hoping it's not my subway.  59.  It was 59?  Holy crap. 
[01:46:00]  That's the subway I take every day.  Anyway, Anthony, yeah, stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  If you want to give it a shot for yourself, a shot, hello, give them a call, 1-800-LITE-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E for stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  That number, once again, 1-800-LITE-LINE, 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Right.  Thousands have proven it works.  Give it a try.  It's stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  I'm delaying because I want to see if something's happening. 
[01:46:30]  Someone comes up.  Hold on.  Channel 7.  Channel 7 News.  Where is he?  A guy possibly with a wild sign.  Come on, a dead bird.  Where are you?  What was he waiting for?  All right.  Perfect opportunity.  There's the dead bird.  That's good.  A dead bird is one of the lead stories on the news.  Well, the West Nile virus, Anthony.  It's back?  The Giant Mosquito?  Oh, no.  Spaz is the Giant Mosquito from last year? 
[01:47:00]  They're already finding dead birds and stuff.  It's not a good sign.  It's going to be a scary season.  Anyway, all right.  We're in the middle of commercials.  We'll break in if there's anything happening with the Psycho Mark Psychopaths out there on live TV today.  All right.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stocks and girls playing What's in My Fan?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Well, Anthony. 
[01:47:30]  Hey.  We have an interesting afternoon happening here.  We got Mano in the studio.  She is a Pakistani girl.  She's Iranian.  Yeah.  I still think she's Iranian.  Her parents are from Iran.  She was born in Pakistan.  Yeah.  You make up your own mind.  Yeah.  We just shaved her ass.  Yeah.  She's got a lot of body hair, you know.  That's kind of a common thing with women that come from that area of the world, right?  They're all haired out and stuff. 
[01:48:00]  And she shaves her genitalia into a wood floor.  Just completely shaves it.  Yeah.  And then we found out she also shaves her arms.  Yeah.  And around her nips.  Yeah.  Which grows a lot of hair.  And then she takes all that hair and she glues it to her back, I think.  Well, her husband likes the hair on her lower back, which is very hairy.  And then she has a very hairy buttocks, which Stinky just took an electric razor to and shaved.  And we actually saved the hair clippings. 
[01:48:30]  I hear we're going to vile it up and give it away at one of our road shows.  We're going to give it to a couple stoners and see if they get high by smoking it.  You know when you see them shaving sheep and it just comes flying off?  Yeah.  It comes falling off the razor.  That's what it was doing.  It was falling off the razor.  Fabulous.  Let's see.  Well, we have Mano's boyfriend.  Husband.  Husband.  Husband on the line.  This isn't the Pakistani guy that beat her that she divorced after six months of matters. 
[01:49:00]  This is her new husband.  Her Jewish husband who likes the hair on your lower back there.  All right.  What's his name?  Chuck.  Chuck.  Wait.  Spaz is saying one moment.  Spaz, just write me a note.  I'm writing.  Spaz is writing.  He's writing.  Dear Santa, for Christmas, I want a new sled and a bike.  All right.  Spaz wrote, lost call, trying to call him back.  Lost call.  All right.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Have that happen, Spaz.  Well, Rick's calling your husband back.  Let's go to Bobby in the meantime.  Bobby, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Having fun with Mano and her hairiness today.  I say shave her back in her ass and put her on eBay as a chia pet.  Yeah, you're like a living chia pet.  Ch-ch-ch-chia.  I have water and watch it grow.  Yeah.  And chia peck a stanny ass.  And she's from Iran or wherever she's from, so, I mean, we're watching it grow.  The chia head.  The chia pet.  I hope she's got plenty more blades to save her ass again, because this is going to keep 
[01:50:00]  on growing.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Well, thank you, Bobby.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah, is your ass getting any stubble on it already?  No.  It has been like 10 minutes.  I've never shaved my ass.  Never?  Close strength.  I can tell.  Yeah.  That was...  You usually don't shave it?  What do you do, style it?  No.  I just leave it alone.  Before we shaved your ass, I thought you were a black woman.  Oh, my God.  Uh, Frank.  Yo.  How are you?  What's up, Opie and Anthony?  Good.  I think they should have put aftershave on and see how sensitive she is. 
[01:50:30]  Well, it wasn't a blade razor.  It was an electric.  Yeah, it still gets sensitive, though.  You should have saw the hair flying off.  Oh, I can imagine.  We're stalling.  We're trying to get her husband on the line here.  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you, Frank.  No problem.  Okay.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Great.  Wow, that's hard to believe.  You never shaved your ass before?  No guy has ever said shave your ass or anything?  Let's go to Drunk Rob.  Spaz wrecked another segment.  Yo, what's up, Opie?  Is he going to walk out?  Is he going to go try to find her?  He wrecked another segment. 
[01:51:00]  Spaz totally ruined this segment.  He hung up on Mano's husband by accident, and now we can't get Mano's husband back on  the line.  I'm walking in.  Drunk Rob, what's up?  What's up, Opie?  How are you?  Yo, I wanted to know why Opie wanted to pick up Chewy so bad with a hairy man ass.  What's up with that?  Yo.  Yeah, real fast, O.D., because we got her husband back on the line.  Why do you want to pick her up?  It looked good, son.  He's going to shout a big butt.  Like that hairy man ass or something?  Hairy man ass, my man.  I think old Dirty's missing prison. 
[01:51:30]  That's it.  I'm walking out.  That's the new thing now.  People are just walking out.  Is that the new thing on this show?  People used to be able to take the abuse on this show.  Now they just walk off the show.  Now everyone feels like they're superstars or something.  Yeah, I'm walking.  I shan't work with that man.  All right, listen, we've got to talk to Mano's husband.  What's his name again?  Chuck.  Chuck.  Hey, Chuck, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  You're a Jewish guy married to Mano?  Absolutely.  And she's...  Oy vey, what an ass. 
[01:52:00]  Mano's is tough.  No, she's a very sweet girl.  Thank you.  I think so.  She's got some nice, nice, ample breasts there, Chuck.  Absolutely.  But my God, hairier than a baboon.  Unbelievable.  Now, Chuck, first of all, how long does it take you to shave her down?  Well, it depends on our mood.  Yeah.  Are you usually in charge of the shaving?  Most of the time.  Yeah?  So you like shaving her down.  How many times a day do you have to shave her?  Actually, it's like once every two days.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Once every two days?  It's a lot of fun.  We're very creative.  It's an event at the...  You guys don't have time to do anything else, huh?  No, absolutely not.  So you shave her arms?  Arms, armpits, legs.  Wow.  All right, let's name all the body parts that you shave on Mano.  Arms?  Arms, armpits.  Arms, armpits.  Around the nip?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah?  That mustache she got?  No, she don't have mustache, do you?  I wax it.  She waxes it. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's cliche.  There's not enough wax in the world to take care of that butt.  Do you have to...  Do you have to...  Do you have to...  Get rid of the hair that, like, sometimes goes from a woman's belly button down to the...  Occasionally.  Yeah.  You can change blades for that.  Wow, sometimes you've got to change blades?  We go through about two or three blades.  Oh, my God.  Do you shave her shoulders, Chuck?  Occasionally, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, shoulders, back.  You get upper back hair sometimes. 
[01:53:30]  Uh-huh.  All right, side, back.  Oh, but it's a lot of fun, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know what you should do?  You're a Jewish guy, right?  Uh-huh.  You should let her grow her genitalia out and then make little payas on the sides and put  a big hat on her and let her walk down Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn.  Okay.  It'll be great.  Guys, I've got to go.  You've got to go?  I've got to go.  Well, we've got to ask you a quick question, Chuck.  Go ahead.  We really, really want to shave her back.  But we hear that's, I guess, a turn-on for you. 
[01:54:00]  You don't want her to shave her back.  Not really.  No, that's my forte.  Yeah, you like that right above her butt.  She's got that tuft of hair.  Why do you like the hair there, Chuck?  I can't tell you right now.  I've got to go.  My boss is in front of me.  Okay.  Don't lose your job.  Don't lose your job, Chuck.  I love your show.  Thank you, Chuck.  Great show.  Shalom.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  There goes Chuck.  There he goes.  But obviously, he doesn't want us shaving that, that's too bad, that thatch of hair.  You can look at Opie's face and tell he wants to shave it so bad. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  Look at him.  You are absolutely right, Mano.  He's really looking like, God damn it, how can we shave that?  Because it's bringing back some horrible nightmares.  Oh, he said, he said, we can't shave it.  Yeah, I know.  Now, we can wax it.  We're there.  I want to wax his back.  He won't let me.  Oh, really?  Is he a hairy guy?  No.  No?  But I want to do it for fun.  What the hell's going on in your household?  What's going on at the...  What else do you guys do for fun? 
[01:55:00]  I don't think so.  I'm allowed to say it on the radio.  Oh, God.  I can only imagine.  This is what happens when Jewish and Pakistani people get together, yo.  That drain in the bathtub must look like a barbershop floor, right?  When you get out of the shower?  Definitely.  Yeah.  I don't doubt it.  All right.  All right, Mano.  Well, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to shave the lower back hair.  It seems our hubby kind of digs it.  Like riding bareback.  You know, you grab onto that piece of mane right by the withers, and you hold on tight, 
[01:55:30]  and yee-haw, let her rip, man.  Hey, Matt, you're next on WWE.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, what's up?  You're next.  What's up?  No, I was just wondering, oh, you're the expert.  I wanted to know whether her ass looked like big red ape ass or wookie ass.  It looked very furry.  Yeah, it was just a fuzzy, like a peach.  Like a fuzzy peach, yes.  That's a good way to look at it.  Fuzzy peach.  Yeah.  It was totally covered in hair.  Oh, that's cool. 
[01:56:00]  You like that?  I thought you guys shaved and did a favor to the society.  It's baby soft, man.  Yes, we did.  It is baby soft.  We got it nice and smooth.  Yeah, baby gorilla soft.  You guys are nuts.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  I'm from Lando the Lost Soft.  All right, Anthony.  Well, Mano, why don't you take a break?  Uh-huh.  Joey from Paisano brought some great food.  We're hoping a couple girls come down for the Blue Tark Cabaret.  We're having a little problem with that, but if they don't show up, what's the problem? 
[01:56:30]  What's the problem?  They shouldn't be upstairs right now.  All right, all right.  Check that.  Yeah, because we had a couple girls coming down to jump on the Blue Tarp today.  Oh, I would like that.  And we're supposed to do strap-on.  Does our GM, Kenny, want to check out Mano?  After all the abuse.  Does our GM want to check out Mano's smooth ass?  Can you show our boss your smooth ass?  It's a chick.  He doesn't believe it. 
[01:57:00]  He's walking down the hall shaking his head.  Someone goes, it's a chick.  Come on.  And he goes, I don't believe you.  I don't believe you?  And he walks away.  Oh, man.  We were trying to share with the new boss.  New boss.  We want to bond with him or something.  He looks distraught.  He's walking down the hall shaking his head like, I don't believe you guys.  It doesn't sound like it's a chick.  What did he say?  He doesn't believe us.  I don't believe you.  I haven't been listening.  I'm not coming in.  He's not coming in.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  So check out some of the fine food from Paisano.  Okay.  We're going to see if the girls are here.  And we'll have you back in a little later in the program.  Okay.  But, Ant, before we go to spots, a bunch of people call and they want to hear the Anthony  bloopers one last time.  Oh, why me?  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  Here's the what's up guys from yesterday.  Hey, O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, O.B. and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7. 
[01:58:00]  O.B.  You're scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  O.B. and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonic little bastard?  1-0-2-7.  Hey guys.  W.N.E.W.  All right.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Absolutely another mess going on today, Ant.  Yeah.  You can tell we're a few days away from taking a week's vacation. 
[01:58:30]  Feels like Friday or anything.  Just kind of goofing off.  Friday's our last show before vacation.  And we started a tradition around Christmas and we're going to continue that.  On Friday, we're going to do the last hour of the radio show with cell phones from a local bar.  I want you guys to hang out with us, have a few beers with us, say hey.  You know, we'll throw some stuff out and then we're going to go on vacation.  Right?  That's fine.  So we don't want to announce the place because we don't want you guys to expect too much from us. 
[01:59:00]  Because it's not like a road show.  Yeah.  It's just us hanging, drinking beers with everybody on Friday.  And it's going to be St. Patty's Day on top of that.  So it should be a lot of fun.  So it's a parzano fried ravioli.  I know.  You're killing me.  This is great.  I can't do the show.  I can't do the show while I'm eating.  But I can't put these down.  Yeah.  Very good.  So on Friday, we'll announce where we're going to be.  Yeah.  So if you're in the area, come on by and say hi.  It's within two blocks of the radio station, which is 57th and 7th.  All right? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, boy.  What?  So now here's a problem.  What?  I opened up the fried raviolis, right?  Yes.  This happened last time.  Now the show is on, so I can't eat them.  Everyone comes filing in and grabbing the goddamn things.  Then we go to break, and there's none left.  No one touches the rest of these.  Uh-uh.  You think I was angry in that Connecticut School of Broadcasting spot?  You're getting very...  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  No.  No.  My.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  Look.  Look at this.  Come on.  Double dip.  Mmm.  Double dip it in your sauce.  Double dip in the sauce.  Oh.  Jesus.  All right.  That's really good.  Oh.  I had to dump it out of myself.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  That'll be an outfit.  I know.  It's like bringing a goddamn supermodel into prison.  No matter what you say, she's getting banged. 
[02:00:30]  That's it.  Great.  No sauce, because Psycho Mark double dip.  All right.  That was a great one.  There.  Have it.  I licked every one.  Okay.  Listen.  Psycho Mark.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Fine.  All right.  She's a hot Iranian woman, basically.  I like to think of this stuff as Pakistan.  Her parents had her in Pakistan, but full parents came from Iran.  Yeah.  A little bio.  She was married to a Pakistani guy who was a real scumbag.  Beat her.  Took two seconds in the bed.  Didn't pleasure her. 
[02:01:00]  And she divorced him after six months.  She's now been married to a Jewish guy for over a year, and we were talking a little  earlier about her preference in men, and she goes she would never go out with another  Pakistani guy, obviously, turned off to the Pakistanis because of the beating and the  lousy sex.  She also said she would not go out with Hispanic guys.  And what was your reasoning for that?  What did you say before?  They're scary.  They're scary, and what else?  In what way?  And they hardly pay for anything. 
[02:01:30]  They hardly pay for anything, and they're scary.  So at this point, hold on, O'Day, hold on.  He's freaking out in the corner.  At this point, Old Dirty lays into her, like, he's disrespecting me in front of my peeps.  How dare you say that?  And he's authentically pissed.  So now he's, like, ragging on Mano and really mad.  Now, Old Dirty, would you like to rebutt what she said?  I never said Old Dirty doesn't pay.  I'm just...  You looked me in the face and told me, all right?  You told me right here, my man.  Joey, hold me, man.  Hold me back, Joey. 
[02:02:00]  Hold me back.  All right?  You told me that my people's Latino men, all right?  We're the hot property right now, baby.  You know what I'm saying?  You can't have none of this.  Yeah, with other men.  Yo, don't have to.  Ricky Martin.  What's up with that?  Well, I'm just saying the hot property, yeah.  Fuck out, man.  Because we're...  That's the new thing on the show.  Walk out.  Walk out.  Now, yo, you went out with a few cheap...  You went out with punks.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm a hustler.  I got money.  All right? 
[02:02:30]  I got that.  Whose phone operator called for whom to pay his phone bill?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Well, let's explain.  Yesterday, we did have a phone operator talking all dirty, saying that he didn't pay his bill,  and that's why half his service was cut off.  Well, now, she says they don't pay their bills, and...  Well, you haven't paid your bill.  I mean, I'm just looking for the outside.  I'm not making any assumptions here.  I'm just stating...  You're stating the obvious.  Yeah.  Well, you know something? 
[02:03:00]  I guess she's dealing through experience, and since she came to the United States from  Pakistan at 17, she's used to growing up in a country that isn't full of political  correctness, and she speaks her mind.  I landed in Newark.  I have left my parents and husband.  I didn't have money.  I was living in Newark, so I was around.  And a lot of the brothers and the Hispanic guys love that ass of yours, I bet, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They love that big ass.  Oh, dirty.  He's pissed.  He's pissed because he was so smitten over her, you know?  Yeah, he was coming over and going, hey, Zay, what's up? 
[02:03:30]  What's that?  That's my word.  You know why he's pissed?  It's because it's true.  So just chill.  Oh, my God.  Now, Rick, the Sordorican, talking to the Dominican.  I wouldn't mind going out with Rick.  Really?  And you know why she says that?  She goes, well, you don't look like one of them.  Oh, my God.  Old Dirty, I'm just reading what's on the screen, so don't, you know, kill me, basically.  Tim says, how can Old Dirty pay with food stamps?  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:00]  Just reading what's on the screen, Old Dirty.  Oh, my God.  He's really pissed, though.  Look, I've never seen him this pissed.  He is.  I think he's bummed because this is the first girl that turned you down.  Not only that, I'm broke.  Yo, that's my word.  Yo, India, bomb Pakistan in the next 30 seconds, bro.  I want it wiped off the mat.  All right, now, Mano, what would it take to go out with O'Day?  Nothing. 
[02:04:30]  No, huh?  No.  You can't be persuaded.  No.  Now, did you decide this right when you walked in and met him, or was it after a little talking?  What happened?  Because it seemed like you two were kind of...  When you saw him, Old Dirty is complimenting her ass and her...  You know what I'm saying?  She said the belly, she's got a little belly that would be good for her, Mickey.  I'm going to have a bite on her stomach and everything.  Right.  And your two-inch saggy stomach.  Gravity taking a pull on that body, huh, baby?  You better chill with that. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Ed from Jersey checking in.  Old Dirty is not cheap when he's done working, a.k.a. jacking someone.  He's got plenty of money to spend.  My man.  Let's go.  So, wait.  This is very interesting.  So, Mano, you sold Dirty and instantly you said...  Right away, criminal.  No way would I go out with him.  Why?  What is it about his appearance?  Joel, you agree with you and everything.  He's just not my type.  Not your type?  Because he has that tiny pencil mustache? 
[02:05:30]  You like that?  I'm a gaucho, baby.  I could ride that cow butt all night.  Oh, my God.  I spank you.  I'll put a bell around you.  I'll call you Mae Bell.  Okay.  Come on.  We're like cattle like that.  Very surprised that Mano's not into hair.  She's not into the mustache.  I've had enough.  Well, she has been in...  I've had enough of that.  She's...  Well, that's telling her. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Dirty, she has been in some abusive relationships.  And, you know, maybe she's just...  I wasn't going to abuse that.  I understand.  I was going to treat that cottage cheese with love, kid.  That's my word.  Mano?  Yeah?  What do you have to say, Dirty?  Now, you're married to a Jewish guy.  Yeah.  And, stereotypically, Jewish guys are supposed to be cheap.  Mine better not be cheap because I'm the one with the money.  He has to ask me for money.  Oh, man, you're supporting your man. 
[02:06:30]  Are you talking about me?  I'm breaking it.  I'm not supporting you.  They just caught me.  I'm not going to just walk out of this movie.  But that movie just made on the rug, I think you can make a lot of money at Penn Station.  That was one hell of a move, old D.  You see that breakdancing move?  I like that.  That was a good move, yo.  You need a big piece of cardboard.  You're all set, yo.  Look at this movie, Nick.  You get some kind of spin thing. 
[02:07:00]  No, my point is my parents.  Go on.  Right?  They said money.  The point of your man.  And you're talking about me being broke?  And you giving your man all that, Lou?  At least I'm not broke.  Go.  Hey, hey, Mano.  Yeah.  Old Dirty has admitted that he's, you know, he's, he's, like, hung, like.  Hey!  So, what's my ex-boyfriend?  Oh, not the current boyfriend?  Not the current husband?  Not the current boyfriend.  No, no.  No, he's not.  And not the Pakistani guy?  Oh, God.  Let's not talk about him. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  It's just disgusting.  According to him, sex was, lay there, don't say anything, don't breathe, don't move.  Yeah, so?  That was it.  Did he put a sheet over you?  Yeah, take a real cold bath.  If he could, he would have.  Really?  All right.  All right.  Johnny from New York City.  Ask the cab driver, Mano, if he would pick up OD in Harlem.  This is good.  A lot of Pakistani cab drivers, yeah.  Yeah, I would.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  Yeah, you would?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd rob you, too. 
[02:08:00]  You'd better feel a cold tech on your neck.  You'd better give up that loot.  Oh, come on.  Shh, Mike.  Talk about cellulite all on the legs, and I'm complimenting that.  I'm ready to chew on her banging stomach and the whole bit, and she's supporting her  man, and she's talking about me being bro, and that my Latino brothers, we can't pay,  and she's supporting her man.  Right.  Now, I support my man.  I got to walk out.  But you said you're the one with the money.  Yeah, I'm the one with the money. 
[02:08:30]  And your parents send it over from Pakistan?  I got, like, a fake cookie bag, son.  What do your parents tell?  They're doctors, right?  Doctors in Pakistan.  That must be great.  Imagine you're visiting Pakistan, and you need a doctor.  Oh, my God.  What kind of archaic doctor?  They got the FCPS and FRCs from London.  Oh, I got a XYZ and an ABC from London.  That's good.  London.  She got that Gucci bag on Canal Street.  Talk about she pays, right?  Come on.  Man, old Dirty, I've never seen you this. 
[02:09:00]  She is living.  Come on, yo.  I've been with ballers.  I've been a baller.  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, in this country, you ride a roller coaster, baby.  You up one day, you down the next.  I've had money.  I've had jewels and ice.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't go to Canal Street and buy fake Gucci bags.  We should put this to music.  Talk about you pay.  We're like a million.  And that Trump's got money in Pakistan, and they got hospitals.  Now, I'm trying to blow up a hospital out here and help you up.  Come on.  Yeah, yo.  Do it. 
[02:09:30]  Come on, man.  Wow, yeah.  Put that to music.  Boy, you can't come and talk down to me in front of my people like that, because I flip  on you, whether you male, female, bisexual, or asexual.  Now, by the flip hand on me.  That's why I'm out with them.  Because they'll flip on you.  Exactly.  That's exactly what I want.  I'll never strike you, but my words will hurt more than a slap.  Well, do I look hurt here?  Oh, you don't.  Oh, do I look hurt here?  You and your stomach.  You eat at Joey Pinsano, kid. 
[02:10:00]  Pinsano's to keep that stomach pumping, baby.  What you think?  Break on me.  You get unleashed on.  Jack.  Baca.  Jack from Jersey.  Indian Falcon.  Jack from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  OG's idea of a date.  Go to see Dice at the Olive Garden with food stamps.  Who your man, Han Solo?  That's your husband, right?  Because you Chewy.  And your man must be Han Solo.  I can't understand half of them.  Yeah, you don't know Star Wars.  They ain't make it out there to Pakistan yet, right? 
[02:10:30]  Been out for 30 years.  I love it, O.D. Red.  Han Solo.  He is going off today.  Got a hairy back.  Got to get shaved.  She got shaved on the internet, son.  What's a woman with all that hair going to do?  Talk about she paid, man.  With a fake Gucci bag.  Hey, she took the razor.  So look at the face in her pouch, right?  I asked for it.  Oh, yeah, no.  I asked for it. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, dirty, man.  You really are pissed, man.  I'm pissed off, yeah.  Shut up.  Don't ever do that.  Oh, don't.  Ever.  You're not even going out with him.  He's yelling at you.  You know?  My point.  Is this what it would be like?  I just spoke to him in five, ten minutes, and he's already flipping out on me for saying something.  So what if I start dating him?  If you were dating him and then you did something that might have upset him, then you'd be stuck in it.  Right.  And then he'd be obligated maybe to hit you. 
[02:11:30]  You'd also be pregnant.  Yo, Opie, man.  Opie!  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  Jose, what's up?  Hello.  Yo, what up?  Yo, what's up, ONA?  How are you?  I'm good.  ODB, what's up?  Thank you for taking care of this business.  Yo, I think what the problem is right now is maybe Mono has like a communication problem.  So, Mono, if you will, let me talk to you for a second, all right?  I hope you can understand this.  Did you get that? 
[02:12:00]  Let's get out.  Yeah.  Yo, I saw him downstairs waiting for him to the linear communication last week.  All right, Jose.  Thank you.  Peace out.  Surprisingly, another Jose checking in.  Let's go to line eight.  Jose.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Okay, you?  Listen, that girl Mono, man.  Tell him, first of all, go to school and learn how to speak proper English.  Okay, second of all, I am a respectable Hispanic male who pays and does things right for the female.  So, you know, she's a very nasty, cruddy, chewing, ugly, fat, hairy, fat, ugly. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, forget it.  Wow.  Hey, Mono, go take a bath.  You smell like onions.  Do it, Jose.  Hey, you rule, guys.  All right, thank you.  Well, obviously, this helping out as far as maybe getting her to go with a Hispanic guy,  I'm sure.  All Hispanic guys are calling out.  Why should I go out anyway?  That's why we got to get these foreigners out of the country.  Close the borders, bro.  Let's go to the borders. 
[02:13:00]  What would happen to maybe you?  Hey, I'm here.  Well, what about your parents?  My peeps are here already.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, let me speak to OD.  Vinny, you're speaking to Old Dirty.  All right, OD.  OD.  Hold on, OD's fighting.  Fighting, fighting going on, fighting in the studio.  All right, OD, talk to Vinny.  Yo, Vin, bro, what about the great job you got and all the money you're making, bro?  Oh, man, I hope you ain't trying to be sarcastic, D.  Well, you think it as it is, buddy? 
[02:13:30]  What happened?  The economy's real good.  What type of job you got now?  Oh, he's trying to be funny, man.  Vinny.  One of your peeps, Joey.  What are you kidding me, kid?  What out of there?  Look, he's doing the same thing you did.  He's in a blanket statement.  Come on, bro.  Come on, bro.  Come on, bro.  Huh?  Come on, bro.  Come on, bro.  Come on, bro.  You're going to come out with all that Italian talk, my man?  Hang out with Italians, the heavyweights, kid. 
[02:14:00]  What you talking about?  All right, take care.  Be quiet, bro.  You're dismissed.  Well, we obviously got to the bottom of that one, Anthony.  Oh.  Any final words for Mono?  O.D.  Let's go to O.D.  O.D.  Here he is.  O.D.  Yo, Rick, man.  Rick, spin that around, man.  Any final words for Mono?  Yeah.  The camera.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  You're dismissed.  Thank you.  Wow.  Damn it.  Have you ever seen him this angry?  Truth hurts.  Who said that?  I didn't say that, yo.  I said it, dude.  She's right.  Yo, Rick, I mean, when the new thing comes and they start roofing everybody and throwing  everybody on the bus, all the speaks on one bus, what bus are you going to get on, my man? 
[02:15:00]  It depends on what bus I can get on.  They ain't got no bus for fake Rickers, bro.  If you're going to be real, you're going to be fake, bro.  That means I guess I'm staying here.  Yo, I want to fight Rick, man.  I want to fight him.  Go ahead.  Fight club just goes.  I'm not here, bro.  Fight club just goes.  They got to be set up.  They got to be like, just, I want to, I want to, y'all.  Truth hurts, man.  Truth don't hurt, man.  What are you talking about?  Hispanic guys can't be trusted.  Who?  Hispanic guys can't be trusted.  But why? 
[02:15:30]  Wait a minute.  But you're Hispanic because they cheat.  It's going to get ugly in five, four.  Because we're cheaters?  What do you mean we cheat?  Dude, my grandfather has 42 kids.  Just by the same wife.  That's not a lie, people.  Rick's grandfather actually has 42 kids.  And I'm not talking about the Levi's.  You believe this tripe that this man is spewing out at this time?  Huh?  Tripe.  That's what it is.  How do you spell tripe?  T-R-I-P-E. 
[02:16:00]  No, come on, Rick.  You're putting us down here, my man.  How are you going to agree with this woman?  Dude, it's a blanket statement.  She's talking from a third-world country, my man.  It's a blanket statement.  She didn't say it about you particularly, but you just happened to fulfill some of the criteria.  That's not right, though, dude.  All right, dude.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  All right.  Rick, man, what's up, man?  I'm talking about you work out.  Joey's Mills Lane over there. 
[02:16:30]  He's in between the two.  Some people want to know if Mono is playing Make O.D. Cry.  Anthony, you're next.  What's up, Anthony?  Yeah, I want to speak to B.O.  I mean, O.D.  You know, you're making fun of a caller to Chewy.  You got turned down.  How does it feel to get turned down by Chewy?  My man.  That would mean that my man, first of all, speak to me like a normal person. 
[02:17:00]  I'm going to speak to you.  I'm going to speak to you as a normal person.  I can't hear you.  Speak up there.  Today, I will not hit the hairy ass, but tomorrow, maybe I will.  Listen.  You can't hit that hairy ass.  You got turned down by Chewbacca.  You know, remember, that's Chaka from Land of the Lost.  You got turned down.  You got turned down.  You know why?  It's because you're a degenerate loser with no job.  Oh, you're hurting me.

It's legal money.  Legal money.  I got illegal money.  You're a proud thief.  You should be very proud.  Your mom and dad will be proud.

Don't even speak.  Shut up.  Let me talk to Pixie Dust and Wrangler there.  They're more of a conversation than you.  Pixie Dust.  Yeah, Pixie Dust.  That's his name.  Hey.

Where are you going?  He walked out again.  You can't lob that softball in and not expect someone to try to hit that over the fence.  All right, it's time to defer the abuse from me to my Joe.  He's getting, uh, he's walking out of the studio more than, uh, Nicky from We Deliver  Keggers.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  That was so funny, I say.  Let's go to Matt on, uh, Line 11.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you, Matt?  I want to talk to Mano.  Mano's in the studio, yes.

Yeah, roll.  Let's go to how it is.  Let's go to Teresa.  Teresa, you have a comment about old days' attitude today, huh?  Teresa.  Oh, I'm sorry.  O.D., this is really not an attractive side of you.  It's not. 
[02:23:00]  You're normally so much more.  She's bought the animal out of me, the Pakistani tiger.  I'm ready to pack.  No, I understand, but normally you're so nice and flowing.  You sound good.  You know, wear the donuts, kid.  You're so nice.  Now all of a sudden you're freaking out.  You're like that other Puerto Rican that they had up there.  I'm not Puerto Rican.  Don't get offended.  No, no, I'm not offended.  It's all good.  I mean, this woman has bought out the worst of me because she's, she's, yo, Rick, man,  just stay out of my line of sight, my man.  Tim from Long Island saying, oh, Dirty, if you're unemployed, he wants to know how you 
[02:23:30]  afford the 50 cards you need for Father's Day.  Oh, my God.  Well, I need like a, like a something to punch.  I think this is turning into make old D cry.  He ain't going to cry.  Oh, man.  Come on, I'm bigger than that.  Hey, Mano, show off your boobs, Tom, everyone.  That's the way we get peace back in the studio.  Don't do it.  What?  What?  Don't do it. 
[02:24:00]  Why?  Why, Rick?  What do we got?  My man, P.O.'s going to defend me.  Yo, where you been at with all this abuse, man?  Shut up.  Okay.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow.  We got like two.  Holy smoke.  What the hell is this?  A little video sent over to kind of calm the races.  What is this?  Bring Harmony back to the show.  I remember her from Lesbian for a Day.  She was like this.  And I remember you from the bubble bath.  Oh, man, this sucks.  Oh, is that a bottle? 
[02:24:30]  We bought a bottle of Cristal for you.  Cristal.  That's the real deal.  This sucks.  Old Dirty's head was about to explode.  And look, it just takes two really hot babes to calm everybody down.  That's how they should work the U.N.  When somebody starts getting pissed.  What do you say?  You come down tomorrow night?  Huh?  What do you say?  You come down tomorrow night?  Coming down to Privilege tomorrow night?  What's going on?  You guys doing a St. Patrick's Day party at Privilege?  Yeah.  And the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Everyone's calm now.  Look at that.  No one cares about any comments that was said. 
[02:25:00]  It's great.  All of a sudden, boobs come out and people just are at peace.  Everyone's mellow now.  This sucks.  We're ready to have a riot.  We're ready to have a race riot.  A race riot was right around the corner.  Wow.  Girls are topless and no one's talking now.  They look great, though.  That's good.  But it doesn't help our radio show when we're about to have a rumble in the studio.  What kind of get-up does she have on?  That's like a see-through thingy.  Oh, she's taking that off.  She's the girl from the bubble bath front. 
[02:25:30]  The little G-strings.  Yes.  Oh, that thing unsnaps right off of you.  All right.  I said we popped the cristal.  I hate that, too.  Oh, Derry, you ever see some?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You ever see that before?  Yes, I have.  Are you sure?  Hey, Mano, what do you think of the girls' bods over there?  It goes for like above 50, but we used to get a favor of dollars a bottle.  It's not as good as Champel, but, you know, Champel. 
[02:26:00]  Whoa, he's coming my way.  Calm down.  Hey, watch that bottle, yo.  That's some expensive stuff.  Well, this stinks.  I mean, the girls look great at all, but where's my riot?  Oh, Dirty, would you like us to put that in a paper bag for you?  Oh, come on.  All right.  It keeps the thona gang away from me.  Wow, look at this, though. 
[02:26:30]  It's so hard to get pissed in anybody with two naked girls in the studio.  Are we real or did you do like work?  Are we putting the girls on the webcam real fast?  Wow.  Quick shot?  Quick shot of the webcam?  That's your natural hair color there?  Yes.  Yeah, I can tell.  I'm a natural redhead.  I can tell by your nips.  I think it was.  Sure.  Nice pink nips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pale nips.  Yeah.  Like Champel.  What about the basement?  Does that match?  Wood floor?  Simpson shaped.  Oh, really? 
[02:27:00]  Geez.  Look at Psycho Mark.  He's insane.  He's like, whoop.  He never gets this close usually to girls before they run away.  Screaming, if you listened yesterday.  Wow, that's something.  Can you guys turn around?  AOD, are you pissed off anymore?  No.  Look at him now, yo.  Man, this sucks.  Rick, we appreciate it, but you have the worst timing in the world, man.  We were ready for a fight. 
[02:27:30]  It was right in black.  Yeah, it was going to go.  Between Pakistan.  We were going to have some wild men right here in the studio.  There's going to be some wilding going on.  Next thing you know, the door opens.  Mano is going to look like the Central Park jogger.  Remember that?  Oh, God damn.  Bring the bell.  Come on, enough time passes.  You can joke about anything.  I figured I had to play the role of Boutros Boutros Gali and try and calm this freaking mess  down.  Boutros Boutros Gali.  Well, it definitely did the job. 
[02:28:00]  The fine ladies from Privilege, Anthony.  Thank you.  That is great.  I haven't been to the girls.  You know what's so funny?  The girls are right here, live, naked in front of us, but I have to, like, check out the  camera.  I'm looking like, wow, look, they're naked on the camera.  But they're right there.  But if you look on the camera, you're like, wow, they're famous.  They're famous.  They're on the camera.  Yeah.  That's great.  Privilege is at 23rd Street.  Yeah.  The ladies are very fine down there. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know if they're going to do it.  Yeah, he's going to open his bottom.  All right, yeah, don't move.  All right.  Champagne can be violent.  Yeah.  Cristal.  Cristal.  How about that?  Could you open it now, Lou?  All right, 13.  No, we'll do that after the show.  We should get that chilled.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Where's one of the wonderful O&A interns to take this to the refrigerator?  Yes, please.  Refrigerator.  Ed on line nine, O.D. equals overdue.  Oh. 
[02:29:00]  O.D., just look at the boobs.  Look at the boobs.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Look.  Just look.  Look at the girls are scared of O.D.  O.D., come on.  Well, he gets out of face on him like he's ready to eat a holiday turkey.  The dancers have to say, just look.  Just look.  Yeah.  Are you girls a little scared of O.D.?  You can be honest on this show.  It's a bra.  What do we have to be afraid of? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, you don't.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  O.D. is sniffing panties right now.  That thing unclips right off.  You could probably just, like, click it and it'll fly off.  They call those breakaways.  Breakaways.  Oh, O.D., what's up?  Oh, I got it.  What?  Hey, you want to do a prison visit with O.D. and one of the girls, maybe?  Oh, that'd be good, yeah.  You ever see the prison visit?  I want to see a prison visit with two girls.  With two girls, huh?  Kevin, if I get flashbacks, bro, I'm just attacking you to the floor. 
[02:30:00]  The prison visit, what we do is we get old Dirty on the other side of the door with a cell phone.  Yeah, with a cell phone.  Then we shut the door, and the girls come up as if they're visiting you in prison and try to turn you on through the glass.  You ever see that in the movies where they touch hands or slowly take a breast out and push it against it?  Yeah, something tells me that won't be too hard.  We just need to get the cell phone immediately. 
[02:30:30]  All right, we'll get old Dirty out there.  We'll have them call up on the prison phone, Anthony.  The prison phone.  Make sure we check them for any shivs or any contraband.  And, ladies, the door is locked, so you don't have to worry about him.  You didn't smuggle any files in your vaginas, did you?  Good girls.  Someone want to pat them down?  Yeah, look at all the hands going up.  Get at it.  Mono.  This is Mono.  By the way, she's from Pakistan, and she's bisexual, and Harry is an ape. 
[02:31:00]  And we just shaved her ass.  You want to show them your smooth ass?  Okay.  All right.  We shaved this ass down.  She looked like a black lady before we started.  It was that dark.  She's from Pakistan.  Check out the job we did on that.  It's a third world country, Pakistan.  They're horrified.  They're absolutely horrified.  Look at her.  She goes, I was shaved by Smelly.  He's like, no, his name is Stinky.  They just made the butthead face. 
[02:31:30]  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got, like, this hairy ass.  She's got the used tennis ball look on.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Looks like she sat in a gravel driveway.  O.D., what's up?  O.D.?  Is that O.D.?  Yeah, what up?  Okay, O.D.'s on the prison.  O.D. is on the prison phone.  Okay, why don't you explain the scene in the studio right now, Ed?  All right.  Hang on.  The studio door is closed and locked.  It's got a big pane of glass in front of it. 
[02:32:00]  All dirty is on the prison phone.  Fucking a bomb.  On the other side of the glass.  And now the girls are visiting him.  Yeah.  Like, up against the glass.  They're pushing their body parts.  O.D., what do you think, man?  Yo, I'm loving it, kid.  Let me get up on that door, yo.  Now, girls.  Girls.  You have to, like, talk like it's a prison visit.  So, oh, baby, you hang in there.  We're working on your appeal.  It's okay.  We got a new lawyer.  And then, O.D., you got to be like, oh, it's so rough in here.  You know, I was voted queen of the weight room prom last night. 
[02:32:30]  No, wait a minute.  All right.  Well, you know what I mean.  Just some prison banter.  Prison talk?  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Yo, so, you holding it down out there?  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  Yo, could you, like, bend over all the way?  Oh, we miss you.  That's a good prison thing.  You miss me, Mark?  I hope both of y'all miss me, though.  Why don't you bump donuts for me real quick?  I like to see that. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, bump.  Well, they're bumping donuts.  He's, like, two feet away.  He's right outside the glass.  But he can't touch.  He can't touch.  The glass is in the way.  Oh, my goodness.  Yo, you got that attorney for me?  What's Johnny Cochran?  What's that fool-ass mother?  They're licking the glass and stuff, man.  They're kissing the glass.  Pressing body part.  Hey, is that door locked?  Yeah.  Don't let him back in.  Hey, there you go.  Come on, man.  Now we'll cover up the window at newspapers so he can't see anything. 
[02:33:30]  Come on.  No, okay.  That was a very good prison visit.  Yeah.  But you girls are not vocal enough, I don't think.  You're not aspiring actresses or anything?  You want to be actresses or something?  What's your goal in life?  To just dance until you're 60?  What are you going to do?  What's that?  I want to watch as much porn as possible.  Oh.  Masturbate and watch porn.  Well, that's good.  That's a good goal to have.  I could get a job anywhere with that.  They want a kid, man.  They're not going to let me back in. 
[02:34:00]  And you're the Cochran girl?  Yeah.  You don't dance?  No.  What are you, crazy?  Private dance.  Oh, private dance.  Don't worry how much money you commit.  Don't worry how much money you commit.  Private dance is over.  Okay, I got you.  Private.  That's private.  I'm going to be cried.  Look at him.  He's freaking out.  He can't see.  He can't see now.  They're blocking the window.  Look at him.  He's ducking all the way down.  And Rick's just moving the paper around so he can't see it.  See through the glass.  All right.  Well, Ant, there you have it. 
[02:34:30]  Boy, that sure calmed everything down.  That really did.  Everyone's at peace now.  John, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, man.  I'm telling you, Rick is a punk.  You know what happened there, boys?  Rick was afraid O.D. was going to kick his ass.  So all of a sudden, he brought the women in.  And then see how good O.D.'s playing that role?  That's where he belongs.  He feels most comfortable like that.  Well, it's kind of a bummer because we were really close to it. 
[02:35:00]  I'm telling you, man.  I was getting all ready.  I said I thought we were going to start hearing slapping and teeth jiggling and all kinds of crap.  No, shut up, bro.  What are you talking about?  I feel comfortable.  You do, don't you?  No, I don't.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  You felt like you were back home again.  Yeah, you feel like you were back home again.  Oh, Dirty.  Turn around.  Look at the boobs.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Look at him.  Okay, he's back to normal.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Take it easy. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  Stay calm.  Stay calm.  Look at the boobs.  Let me just go to Steve.  He wants a compliment.  Old Dirty.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, what up?  Hey, I have a question for ODB.  Okay.  Who has a hairier ass?  Manu or his sellmate from Rikers?  Your mom, actually.  All right, yeah, that's cool, man.  Take care.  Oh, Dirty, calm down.  Calm down.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the boobs. 
[02:36:00]  Everyone just...  Smell the boobs, actually.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Okay.  Jesus.  All right, let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  What's up?  What's up?  I have seen more breasts in the past two weeks than I've ever seen before.  This guy's 12.  And I will call to you guys.  Thank you.  How old are you?  16.  Yeah.  You're fine.  I'm pumping out the map of Hawaii pretty much every day.  All right, John.  Bye.  Bye.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  What?  Nothing, that. 
[02:36:30]  Yo, PR, you know I haven't sat down like in 45 minutes, man.  You know what I'm saying?  What's up with that?  You're over here.  You don't do nothing.  You ain't producing for me, my man.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the boobs.  Look at them bumping donuts.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  They're shaking them and pushing them together.  Look at the, yeah, yeah, there you go.  He's calm again, ladies and gentlemen.  I was hoping for a fight myself, but, uh, Mono, do you think the girls are hot?  Yeah?  Very hot, yes. 
[02:37:00]  What?  What?  What?  There's some bonding going on over there, Anthony.  Yeah?  That is the Goody Trail.  Well, what happened?  What happened?  Crushed M&M's, yo.  Well, one of them is bent over so he can check out her ass, and he's just going, man, that's  the Goody Trail right there.  The Goody Trail.  Very good.  Well, we want to thank the girls from Privilege.  Thank you very much, ladies.  Thank you for having us.  I hope you enjoyed the bottle of your stuff.  Oh, we will.  Yeah.  And, uh, we encourage everyone to go down to, uh, Privilege 23rd and 11th Avenue for their 
[02:37:30]  St. Patrick's Day party.  They're doing that tomorrow night, did they say?  When is that?  Tomorrow night?  Yeah.  Tomorrow night?  Okay.  Tomorrow night.  Well, we've got to take a quick break.  And the Kochek girl's available for private dancers.  Private dancers.  She's smoking.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  To all of those being Anthony listeners, what's that?  I don't know what's wrong with some people.  Don't you find something better to do in your afternoons?  Sitting around listening to the radio.  What kind of a name is Opie? 
[02:38:00]  Anyway.  It's like, it's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  Don't screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E-W-N-E.  All right, Anthony.  Ah.  Yeah.  I don't know what we're accomplishing today, but, uh...  Nothing.  Again.  But damn, it's fun.  A few days away from vacation. 
[02:38:30]  Friday, leaving the show around 545, doing the rest of the show from cell phones and a megaphone from one of the bars close to the studio.  Yeah.  We'll be within, uh, a two, three block radius of the radio station.  Yeah, so be around.  Be around and hang out with us and drink some beers before we go on vacation next week.  Okay, that's what we're doing.  Friday, uh, Mono's still hanging out in the studio.  The girls, uh, left, right?  They got their plug and they ran out the door. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  Well, um, Rick, why don't you grab a mic and, uh...  Hey, where'd the bottle of Cristal go?  They took it with them.  No!  What?  No, they didn't.  Is it being chilled?  Yeah, it's back, back being chilled.  You gotta have a little taste of that after the show.  That is, that's like, you know, on the level of Dom and stuff.  Yeah, it doesn't even have a twist on it.  Better than Dom.  It's a real deal, kid.  Better than Dom.  I'm very young.  He's fat, like, like Mono, kid.  Oh, my God.  The boobs go away and the violence comes back. 
[02:39:30]  Jesus Christ, man.  Old Day, do you have a corkscrew in your pen?  I can, uh...  Gotta get on mic, man.  I'll start to school with you.  I can open a bottle for you.  Yeah, all right.  All right, well, what's going on, Rick?  I guess someone showed up?  Yeah, I guess one of the listeners heard that Mono was here that liked women and decided  to come on down and make herself available for a little, uh, I don't know, taste.  A little take action?  Oh, a little taste.  Wait a minute.  She, um...  She wants to clean the tap. 
[02:40:00]  Needs a little...  Right.  You did say woman, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  A little, uh...  Because I did take a break while we were playing commercials.  I was just making sure you said woman, carpet munch.  Right.  Okay.  That's okay.  Okay.  Horrific.  Well, why don't we bring her in and meet her?  I have yet to even see this girl.  Mm-hmm.  Joey, you might want to move over.  Did you take a peek over?  I think she's going to take that mic.  And what do you think?  You're horrified?  Okay.  Horrific.  My name is Jen. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  Wow, look at you.  All right.  Huh?  Don't take on me.  I heard that the way you were abusing you, and I'm afraid now.  So what's...  I'm serious.  What's your name?  Janna.  Janna?  Janna.  Oh, Janna.  Yeah.  My friends are freaking out right now.  And, um...  There's all my legs over here.  What?  What?  Strong legs.  You've got some muscle, kid.  Yes.  What do you do?  Do you have muscle?  Yeah, I go to the gym.  You go to the gym?  Yeah.  Could you show some...  Show Amano something here.  I don't know what you want to say. 
[02:41:00]  What do you want to see, Amano?  The book area?  I'll be afraid, all right?  Play along, say boobs.  Play along, say boobs.  Oh, okay.  I would like to see her boobs.  You'd like to see her boobs.  Oh, look at that.  Okay.  Not much to look at.  All right.  All right.  I don't know.  They're pretty hot.  She's not prepared today.  She has to excuse me, but...  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, she's got a tat on her.  I have cam on me.  I can't believe...  You got a tattoo on that thing.  I got three.  Let me see the one on the breast area. 
[02:41:30]  What is that?  Chinese symbol for tiger.  That's my birthday underneath.  Are you a tiger?  I was born the other tiger.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It looks like you've had that a while.  Two years, three years.  Really?  Yeah.  You spend a lot of time out in the sun, do you?  Yeah.  That thing kind of faded.  I know.  Hmm.  What?  Okay.  So why'd you come down to the show today?  Oh, well, first of all, I heard she's bisexual, and it sounded like some of the girls that  were supposed to come down weren't coming.  Yeah.  Which I guess sometimes happens, so I figured I'd liven it up with that. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Huh.  Would you like to see Mano's moves?  Are you bisexual, lesbian?  Yeah, I'm bisexual.  Okay.  Mano?  I didn't get to see it on the spaz camera earlier.  Yeah, Mano?  I was at work in the West.  All right.  I was going to throw a little view there, Mano.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  She's more prepared.  She didn't come to the bra.  Look at that.  She had it on before.  I took it off.  She took it off.  Look at those things, huh?  She took that off hours ago.  What do you think of those?  Bigger than mine.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, very big, huh?  I think bigger than mine is fine. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, we shaved her ass, too, for you, so.  Yeah.  I don't go that far.  All right.  There's just no...  No.  No.  Well, you came down here for a reason, I guess.  You wanted to...  I told Spaz we were missing in action at the moment.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  All the ballast tanks.  All right.  We had a dump out of that.  I'm sorry.  You would like to go for a taste, I believe. 
[02:43:00]  A taste, as they say.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we understand.  Yeah.  Like the taste of hot machine.  Oh, my God.  Not summer, thank God.  Well, Mono, um...  Mono, should we...  I don't know.  Would you be...  We might have to call her husband again.  Would you be open to, um...  Should we bring the lesbian couch in, Mono?  All you have to do is lay back?  Yeah.  Really?  No?  No.  She's embarrassed.  Aw, aw, I thought we had a love connection. 
[02:43:30]  Did she, like, uh, touch your boobs or something?  No.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  She said she's bisexual.  Now she's not.  Oh, Mono.  You want to touch my boobs?  Yeah, I want to touch my boobs right now.  I want to touch them.  All right.  I do it.  O.D. coming around?  O.D.  O.D. is so pissed.  Okay, touch them.  I want to touch them from behind, Miller. 
[02:44:00]  All right, listen, listen.  It's not dough, man.  It's not dough.  Really, what is he doing there?  Really, he's like the guy with the pizza dough at the...  Needing the dough.  You just calmed him down.  Look at him.  Look how calm he is now.  I've seen more sensitivity when someone's given CPR.  I saw it, you know.  I know sand up for net pieces.  That was nice.  Yeah, he was soft. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah?  All right.  Now, why would you let old dirty do that and you wouldn't let our new guest do?  Because old dirty is like...  Sort of, he looked like he needed it.  She threw the boobs at you for charity, O.D.  You're in charity, Kate.  Welfare boobs.  She's going to charge you a couple of boobs.  Now, I'm unemployed and desperate. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, my God.  You laughed at PR.  I mean, do you know the abuse I've been undergoing?  All right, listen.  Now, Mano, what's the problem with our new guest?  Yeah.  I'm probably not her taste either.  Is that it?  Really?  What's the problem, Mano?  You're pretty honest.  You've been honest with old dirty.  Let's hear her.  What seems to be the problem?  If she's bisexual, she's probably very talented in that area.  And if you just lay back on the couch, shut your eyes, you might be surprised.  I imagine it's her husband.  Or something, you know. 
[02:45:30]  We could put a bag over your head, so...  I might have to grow some...  If that's the problem, and poke a little hole or something.  I don't know.  What seems...  Come on, guys.  We'll do the unknown lesbian.  Look at this.  She's like, come on, guys.  I'm trying to be nice here.  Wait, Mano, come on.  You're brave enough to diss old dirty.  What's the problem here?  I'm about to get insulted.  No.  I wouldn't insult anybody for anything.  I feel like that's what it is.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:46:00]  Come on, Mano.  Come on.  People aren't sitting in their cars because you don't want to insult anyone.  Let's hear it.  What seems to be the problem?  She's not my type.  Is there a type?  There's a type when it just comes to a...  I'll turn up the girls from the other one.  I wouldn't have mentioned.  Oh, wow.  Sick.  I'm too big now, see?  Oh, my God.  I'd make my song.  You know, sometimes the Cristal is not around.  You've got to accept the champagne.  It's not always Cristal. 
[02:46:30]  It's not always Budweiser.  Sometimes you've got to go for that old Milwaukee.  Old Milwaukee.  Not always.  Right.  Exactly.  Sometimes the king of beers isn't around.  You've got to go for some Schlitz, you know?  Oh, God.  This small.  Oh, we're just kidding.  All right.  You're a 40 of all we.  It might be a few.  Not quite so 64 hours.  You're 140.  You're good.  You know?  Good to go. 
[02:47:00]  Not even willing to give it a try there, Mono, huh?  No.  Would you give in to anything?  A little touching?  A little...  A little...  No.  Wow.  She's adamant about this.  No.  Wow, look at her eyes getting really big.  What's the problem here?  She likes Sophie, kid.  You know, we can't get a supermodel here every day, you know?  Sometimes I go upset.  You've got to forego the filet mignon for a Swanson's TV dinner.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:30]  And he's playing to play a big new girl.  Burger King with that book's just fine.  Big love.  Oh, this is so nasty.  You know, this isn't cool.  She was brave enough to come down to the show.  Come down here.  Hmm.  All right.  She's ready to put on the snorkel and mask and...  Go cod fishing.  Down.  So the girl with the hairy ass and the hairy back turned down the new girl in the studio. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Well...  All right.  That's all right.  Sometimes we don't have a love connection.  It just happens.  In other cases, we'd be watching the couch right now and it would look like a bunch of  spanking monkeys around the couch.  But no, it doesn't always work out.  Doesn't Joey look like Chuck Willery with the Rolex?  He's an old dirty.  That's a swat.  Oh, man. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Well, I have a Rolodex watch.  It's closed.  I thought it said rolling.  All right.  I guess it ain't going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  You know what?  If we didn't have that goddamn no drinking rule in here, they'd have been going at it.  What?  What?  I would have been willing to use a strap-on.  Oh, no.  You know what happened?  Well, we at least have to get her number for the next girl that's willing to come down.  Unfortunately, I don't have to work until five.  Can we at least take pictures of you?  Depends.  But with a strap-on on, like ready for action or something? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like commando style?  Because he wants it bolster.  You want to take some pictures of that, Rick?  You can use a strap-on on O.C.  Oh, we don't.  Oh, Joey.  Joey's the end of the day.  Yeah.  That was a good comeback, though, Joey.  No one has a strap-on, though, right?  Because I'm thinking if there was a strap-on laying around, maybe Mono would want to use the strap-on.  On who?  On our finance. 
[02:49:30]  She doesn't want anything.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I just want to know, how ugly is this girl that's on that she's even dissing her?  What?  Hey, horrific.  How ugly is this new girl that you think dissed so badly?  Uh, she's not bad.  No?  Come on.  You know, I'm driving in my car.  I was all excited.  And then when Mono dissed her, I'm like, oh, she must be really heinous.  It's going to make you puke.  Oh, my God. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  I didn't do that one.  Oh, my God.  I'm not listening anymore.  I'm just for staff.  That's just so funny.  I didn't do that one at all.  That's amazing.  That's it, Spaz.  Don't go to the Red Rock anymore.  I'll make sure they abuse you more.  All right.  Well, we don't have a love connection, Anthony.  It's very obvious.  Obviously not.  So I think we're going to thank, you can hang out, have some food and stuff.  Oh, Jay, thanks.  Oh, man, this is going to suck donkey bars. 
[02:50:30]  I tried.  Sorry.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  No, I mean, we were hoping, you know.  I mean, Jesus.  We'd all be standing around watching you go to town, but.  Yo, do you get that on the regs, though?  Yes, I do.  No.  I'm just asking.  What?  Well, where the hell did that come from, all dirty?  Yeah.  What did you say?  He asked her if she had.  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Hold on.  You can do a vice grip, too, while I'm at it.  But what are all good?  He asked her if she likes to have sex during her time of the month. 
[02:51:00]  Oof.  And she said yes.  Okay.  No.  Oh, no?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Isn't that what you're saying?  He asked if I got banged on the reg.  On the regular.  Oh, on the regular.  Sunday, bloody Sunday.  All right, listen, listen.  All right.  All right.  We're dumping it out.  Cut it out.  All right, cut it out.  I'm turning their mics down.  John, what's up?  Yo, that girl is horrible, man.  I just saw her on the webcam.  My computer screen blew up.  Oh, my God.  Slip him the bird, man.  She's not on. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, she is on the webcam.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, take it easy.  I don't think you're that bad at all.  He's probably sitting there with a small wiener and whacking off right now.  There you go.  There you go.  So you've got to fight back on the show.  Let him sit there and do the two-finger shuffle.  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  We'll come back and we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today, all right?  Right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Dudes with dudes. 
[02:52:00]  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Come here.  Come here.  We're out of control.  We're so happy.  All right.  Knock it off.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you remember our good friends at Stacker?  They were here with us during the summer.  And then I guess they laid off a while, but they're back, Opie.  They were here during the dark years of the Opie show.  Very grim.  Or the dark months.  The dark months that seemed like years. 
[02:52:30]  But they're back after the holidays.  Everyone pigged out.  You know.  You all had the big dinners with your family, and you plumped up a bit.  And the coats are covering them up.  Okay.  But, you know, spring's right around the corner.  You better start losing weight now.  And it also cuts the cravings to eat in between meals.  Very good.  That's where you gain a lot of weight.  Yeah, when you're snacking.  Your fellow employees dasking.  They got, like, the little kisses or cookies or something rolling around there. 
[02:53:00]  It's a coconut hostess snowball.  Right.  How could you pass that up?  Oh, with a gooey marshmallow-y coating.  Check out Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, at www.stacker2.com.  That's stacker2.com, or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street. 
[02:53:30]  Hand me the RPG-7.  1027-WNEW.  Play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, we got to bring in Anthony real fast.  I'm here, Opie.  No, another Anthony.  Oh, oh.  Anthony is the most popular name of our listeners, too.  Anthony was on TRL yesterday, Anthony.  No, today.  Oh, today you were on? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah, I saw that sign today.  Yeah, we delivered keggers.  Another psychopath making it on TRL, on MTV.  He had the WOW sign and the We Deliver Kegger sign all over the TV.  Yeah, allegedly.  He had allegedly on the screen today.  And, of course, okay, terrific.  All right.  Anthony's been waiting out there for like two hours.  We've been really preoccupied today.  I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific.  We almost had to bump Anthony.  You know how, like, the talk shows do it? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, they bump certain guests.  That's terrible.  So now we have to do the quick interview, like, oh.  The quick.  Did you have fun listening to the show from the lobby there?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What do you think of Mono?  Eh.  Wow.  She's got a nice smooth ass now, though.  I think that's all we did on the show today is shave her ass.  That is hairy.  All right, what do you think of the one to your right?  Janet?  Jane?  Jane?  What? 
[02:55:00]  She's not a bitch.  Compare.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Different taste.  Wait, so who's hotter?  Well, thank you, my dear.  She's going to give you a Hummer for that, I believe.  Wow.  All right, so you think she's better looking than Mono.  What did I miss?  All right, because I'll take one, too.  All right, you want to plug anyone, Anthony?  I just want to say hello to my friend Mike, who's listening right now.  Okay.  And anyone who's attending Five Towns College. 
[02:55:30]  All right, very good.  Five Towns.  Cool.  Well, let's hear it for Anthony.  He's going to get a bunch of prizes for getting the wow and the signs on live TV today.  We love that.  Besides the confiscated, I don't know.  It depends.  If he wants to leave him, that's cool.  I'll leave him.  All right.  Time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Royal from Jersey.  Today I learned Mountain Dew's new tagline, eat my...  Can't say the word on the radio.  Yeah, a little bit of trouble.  We had to bleep that, but Lizard from Wontaw, I learned today that O.D. stands for Out of 
[02:56:00]  Dough.  Lauren from Jersey, I learned that I can't get a date with O.D. because I don't have a  fat, hairy ass.  You see what you did to me, Black-a-standing woman?  You destroyed me!  Paul from Whitestone, Queens.  I learned today that black girl's new name is Urko.  Urko.  Urko?  Now, see, we're not allowed to make fun of Earl anymore.  Is that it?  Because he can't take it.  He walked out today.  He definitely walked.  So I guess Earl is off limits. 
[02:56:30]  We can make fun of everyone else in the studio here, but not Earl.  Not Earl.  Okay.  He does it personally, so.  From now on, he's just going to be called Earl.  Well, we don't have to call him anything because we won't really be referring to him.  Because it'll be hard to talk about.  All right, Bob, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that making rugs of Persian ant hair can be more lucrative than Persian rugs  themselves.  And that Anthony is ashamed to do any Darth Vulgar or any Yoshi voices anymore. 
[02:57:00]  Why is that?  Because you don't do Darth Vulgar, man.  You had like 20 minutes to do that voice during that whole Chewbacca thing.  I do too.  You do not, man.  All right, man.  We'll do it.  We'll do it again.  You better.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that fun bag sued the savage beast.  Fun bag sued the savage beast.  That's so true.  And I'm kind of hooked up with Mono, man.  She's still here.  If it's another thing I learned is that even a lesbian who's long in a tooth is still a 
[02:57:30]  hot lesbian.  For you.  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  See you in the case now.  All right.  I'm not sure how to feel with Rick here.  We were ready to have a race riot, and then we got to see really nice boobs, so I'm not  really sure.  That's all right.  I think it worked out for the best.  Yeah.  T, what's going on?  Owen Egg, what's up?  Hey, tell Mono, there ain't nothing wrong with it.  It tastes like fish, smell like chicken, hold your nose, and keep on licking. 
[02:58:00]  Owen Egg, if anybody can do it.  Get her licking, guys.  Come on.  We tried, man.  We didn't have the pimp hand today.  Jay Moore would definitely be disappointed.  Yo.  Yo.  At least have her do a prison visit.  Come on.  Yesterday's show was out of control.  Let her do a prison visit with Psycho Mark.  We're running out of time.  All right, guys.  We'll do it tomorrow, man.  All right.  Later.  Okay. 
[02:58:30]  Let's go to TJ.  TJ, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Today we learned that Opie and Anthony's favorite thing to do isn't reading copies.  Yep.  Hey, guys.  I went to see Paul Bond last Thursday at Rascals, and if anyone is out there looking to see a  comedian who is absolutely hilarious and puts on a great show, he's the guy to see.  Yeah, look at that.  He was great.  Paul from airsick.net.  Cool.  He had me in tears.  Thank you, TJ.  Indication now.  Okay, man.  Bye.  Let's go to Richie.  Richie, you're next on NDW.  Yeah, I learned that Pakistani women are descendants from woolly mammoths, and they 
[02:59:00]  can be on the Discovery Channel if they're willing to be frozen in the snow.  That's right.  Thank you, Richie.  All right, guys.  Indication now.  All right.  Let's go to Mario.  We have a couple more left here.  Mario, what's up?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Yeah, I learned we could have played What's in My Pants with Mono's backside.  Yeah.  What's in the back of my pants?  How about that?  That could have been special today, yeah.  Yep, yep.  Hi, Natalia. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Thank you, Mario.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that if I need to bang a Pakistani girl, I've got to shave her ass first.  And also that you guys hire the biggest fags in the world between spags and Urko walking  out on you every time you say the wrong thing.  I know.  Too many people are walking out on our show.  They can't take it anymore.  It's a new thing.  You know, once one person does it, it's just like everyone can do it now.  Unbelievable.  It's stinky.  When are you walking out?  Look, he's just calling stinky.  He's walking out.  He's just walked out. 
[03:00:00]  He's all pissed off.  It's the new thing.  He's so stupid, though.  He's going to just keep walking.  Right?  He doesn't even realize in his head it's a joke.  Come on back, stinky.  Yeah, dude.  Don't walk all the way to the short bus.  Not yet.  Not time.  Hey, James.  You're next.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, don't.  I learned today that no matter what nationality they may be, brown people cannot get along.  Wow.  F. Johnny Action. 
[03:00:30]  I'm out.  All right.  F. Johnny Action.  Wow.  That's an obscure reference.  That goes back.  I think we're done it.  Yeah.  What a day.  What a day.  We've got to thank Mano.  She was the star of the show today.  Thank you, Mano.  Thanks a lot, Opie and Anthony, for having us.  I wonder what would be more satisfying to society, working in like a cancer cure lab, AIDS cure,  trying to work on a cure, or this show.  Judging from what I learned on the Opie and Anthony show, I think it's this show. 
[03:01:00]  I think we do more of a service than trying to cure deadly diseases on a daily basis.  All right.  Joey, thanks for coming by.  Joey from Paisano.  Joey, congratulations, Joey.  Joey's back.  Joey.  Joey's back.  He's been incognito for a while there, but go down to Paisano and check out the fight.  And may your next child be a masculine child.  And, of course, O.D. and P.R. and everybody else.  All right.  Kevin, right?  Kevin and Anthony from Cubby, Annette, Roy. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  And we've got to step aside.  Don and Mike are next.  Thanks for listening.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  We'll see you, Anthony.  One man.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No, it's our show.  I'm a madman.  I'm getting hit.  You sound like a stock-raving mad person. 
[03:02:00]  No, I'm getting hit.  No.  No.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No.  O.D. and Anthony.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  1027-WLW.  1027-WLW.  Thank you. </pre>
