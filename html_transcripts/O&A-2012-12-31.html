<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a multi-part segment recapping the “Worst of 2012,” focusing on a protracted feud between comedian Joe DeRosa and show employee Troy Kwan.  E-Rock introduced the conflict, which began with DeRosa verbally attacking Kwan's attire, calling him a "hipster douchebag" and mocking his skateboard, shoes, jeans, and hairstyle. Kwan retaliated with insults about DeRosa's physique and clothing.  The argument escalated into a full-blown, expletive-laden exchange targeting each other's professional lives and comedic abilities.  Comedian Dave Attell joined the studio during this segment, attempting to mediate but to no avail.  Listeners voted on who “won,” resulting in a near tie.  Despite attempts at reconciliation, the segment concluded with unresolved tension.  A later segment revisited the DeRosa/Kwan conflict, highlighting the escalating tension and culminating in a refusal to shake hands, though a hug was eventually offered. The hosts suggested increasingly absurd solutions, ranging from cupcake sharing to flag burning.

The show then moved to other conflicts.  The hosts criticized a new sound effect by employee Sal, calling it "complete garbage."  A dispute between Andrew Dice Clay and Bonnie McFarlane over a photograph was discussed, followed by a lengthy segment detailing a falling out between Bonnie McFarlane and Joe DeRosa during a film shoot.  This segment included McFarlane and her husband in studio, detailing DeRosa's alleged controlling behavior, anger over spilled peppers and onions, and insincere apology.  DeRosa defended himself, citing stress and high expectations.  Accusations of unprofessionalism and even sexual tension were made by both parties. Rich Vos participated in this discussion.  This segment also featured a discussion of a "Twitter war" between comedian Tom Green and another person with the same name, with the Opie & Anthony crew encouraging listeners to bombard the other Tom Green with offensive tweets. Amy Schumer also appeared, sharing anecdotes about her stand-up career. The segment concluded with a phone call from Tom Green's mother, Mary Jane, adding a lighter tone.

The show featured a segment with Tom Green and his mother, Mary Jane, discussing pranks Tom pulled on his parents for his MTV show, including placing a decapitated cow's head in his mother's bed and a domestic abuse statue.  His father threatened a $1 million lawsuit, leading to a situation where Tom, his parents, and the bit appeared on Oprah, resulting in Oprah sending Tom's parents to Tahiti.  Mary Jane signed a release form allowing the bit to air.  The show then shifted to a discussion of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, with a caller, Tim, defending the university while Opie and Anthony made offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with a surprise appearance by Mike Tyson, who discussed his Broadway play, "The Undisputed Truth," his past struggles, and current life.

Another segment began with a nonsensical bit about a fictional band and a dance called "The Stroke," followed by a discussion of a photo from the 2004 Porn Awards showing one of the hosts grabbing a woman's breasts.  This transitioned into discussions of gun control and the "look" of power as one ages.  Stanley Tucci then appeared as a guest, discussing his cookbook, Italian food, and his past jobs. The main part of this segment was an interview with Damien Echols of the West Memphis Three, along with his wife, Lori.  Echols discussed his wrongful conviction, prison conditions, including beatings and lack of medical care, his release via an Alford plea, the media's role, and the challenges of adjusting to life outside prison. Lori Echols also briefly spoke about her involvement.  The segment ended with a heated argument between Joe DeRosa and Dr. Steve, played over a series of tweets.  A phone call with Joe DeRosa followed, involving a playful, aggressive exchange with host Steve, filled with insults and mock threats.  The conversation shifted to DeRosa promoting his stand-up shows in Philadelphia, mentioning Garfunkel and Oates.  Dr. Steve joined, offering well-wishes and promoting his podcast and DeRosa’s shows.

[00:00:30]  Start  It's the worst of 2012 for the Opie and Anthony Show  My name is E-Rock  E-Rock Radio and Twitter  And there's a lot of stuff going on today  Most of it features Joe DeRosa  There's a reason to all of this  Because Joe had some key features from this year  That we need to explore  And maybe makes you understand Joe DeRosa a little bit better  But it's not just all Joe DeRosa  We feature some stuff from Sal  Our hipster new employee 
[00:01:00]  Bonnie McFarlane has some scuffles with some people  Tom Green  We talk Penn State  Mike Tyson  Damian Eccles from the West Memphis Three  And much much more  But right now we're going to start with Joe DeRosa  This is part one of the infamous  Well now infamous  Joe DeRosa vs. Troy Kwan fight  Joe comes in and decides that  He doesn't really like the look that Troy has  He thinks Troy is kind of juvenile  He's a hipster douchebag  Trendy  And this sets Troy off  To what could be one of the greatest fights 
[00:01:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show  Part one  Joe DeRosa vs. Troy Kwan  Right now  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Well a lot of people are like  Oh uh oh  I agree with Troy  Troy is  Troy is in denial that he's 40  He is closer to 40 than 21  Oh my god  That was a funny one  At this point he's  Almost closer to 40 than he is to 30  I know 
[00:02:00]  Tell Troy to start dressing his age  That bothers me  Does it?  Well you should have seen him come in here with his skateboard the other day  Alright  Is there anything sadder  Than Tony Hawk?  Is there anything  Just a 50 year old man  With a skateboard?  You know how much he's worth?  Yes stop it  I would love to go with this bit  But you know how much fucking Tony Hawk has worth?

Like what 50?  So he's still mad at you  He pulled Sam aside  No shit  He's a little  He's a little  So you want to bring him in here for a sec?  They have Sam aside nets  That are hanging out  Oh  Are you guys stirring up the shit  Or is he really still mad?  Oh he's still mad  Yesterday he told me  He was still  He's still a little hot under the collar 
[00:22:00]  About last time  Why?  Quick go to page 82  How to handle the disgruntled Asian  Quick  He  He  Listen  It's fucking  Here comes Troy Kwan  David Hell  There he is  He doesn't look Asian to me  No he's not  Isn't that weird?  I just said something to Sam the other day  What did you say to Sam?  I just  I don't know  Joe just rubbed me the wrong way that day  And I just  I'm having a hard time letting it go  Why?  Listen  What got to you? 
[00:22:30]  Well just because he just took a shot for no reason  And it just seems like  Oh boy  Like we were cool  And then he just had nothing to say that day  And was just like  Oh let's just fucking take a shot  No I had something to say  It was about your stupid fucking shoes  I really thought you were Asian  I didn't know  Yeah Troy Kwan sounds like  He didn't hear that Joe DeRose  I thought that was a good  What was it again?  A little chuckle out of Ant  But he didn't hear it  He needs to hear that  What did you say?  I missed it  No forget it  Listen  Here's the thing  Is  I was  I was joking around with you that day  About your shoes 
[00:23:00]  And your skateboard  And we were fucking around  And then I immediately  Immediately felt bad  Because we're friends  I was like  And I even said on the air  Troy  I'm really sorry dude  I  You gave me a nice pounding back  I was asking for this  I was just bored  I felt like trashing somebody  I was wrong  I fucking admitted it  Three times in the air  You were the one that wouldn't let it go dude  You just kept coming at me after that  I was like dude  You got me  Because he started it  That's just the way it goes  But how many  Oh boy  So what  If a guy hits you first  Do you beat him to death? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah  Watch your fucking loot  Really?  Would you beat him with records?  If you come to  You're getting into it again Joe  Oh no  That's not even that funny  Yes it is  What are you 33's or 78's?  I need to know  The four people I needed to laugh  It's sort of funny  Imagining you at a record  That's the way Joe is  Do you picture him working in an independent record store?  Is that what that was about?  The Laurel of Hardy  Like taking out a record  And going  Watching it shatter on a guy's head  Last record store  Dave I'm sorry you're here for this 
[00:24:00]  This is going to get a little bit comfortable  No this is there  That's the way Joe is  Sort of funny  We heard you the first time  We heard it the first time  I missed it the first time  So listen  Troy  I missed it  Do you live in Brooklyn?  Really?  No  So why are you throwing that Brooklyn thing on him?  Huh?  I didn't throw that Brooklyn thing on him  Okay he's a Brooklyn hipster then  He said it  Where do you live there?  I live on the Upper East Side  Oh okay so he's a New York guy  So Troy  This whole time I thought you lived in Brooklyn  No  That's his vibe  It's his vibe right? 
[00:24:30]  Brooklyn vibe?  I would agree  I would be surprised  Because the Upper East Side doesn't have a vibe  It's a hit town  That's a hit store area too  That's a cool area  How is it?  I don't know anything anymore  I live in the Kennedy Airport  What can I do?  This is my fucking gripe  With certain people  Involved with the show  Certain people  Wow  This is what bothers me with you  We fucking slam each other constantly here  You think I haven't come in here  And gotten trashed for no apparent reason?  Never 
[00:25:00]  You think Sam's never gotten trashed for no apparent reason?  That's fine  And if Sam has a problem with somebody  He'll take it up with him  But here's my thing Troy  It's like  There's no fucking way in hell  That's the first time you've been trashed on this show  By a comic that's come in here  And did you hold a grudge with anybody else?  Or are you fucking holding a grudge with me  Because I'm the easy guy to hold a grudge with  Because I'm not Burr or Patrice  Or one of those guys  Well I mean  None of those guys have said anything  Well Patrice said something to me before  But I mean I'm not going to fucking go after him  He's crazy  Well he's fucking a lunatic  No because that's pussy shit  You won't go after Patrice 
[00:25:30]  If you go after me  So you're not going to fight back at all  So you admit that you're not even in the same league as that  No that's not what I'm saying  What I'm saying is  Is you want to pick and choose  So you'll be mad about  And whatever  And you're looking at me  It's easy for me to be mad at Joe  Because I think I'm a worthy adversary of his  But whereas I think Patrice would have stopped me out  So I won't fucking say shit back to him  Well I mean you've got to choose your battles right?  If you're a pussy  Oh  So you're going to go after somebody like that?  I go after anybody that goes after me  And then when they go  I'm sorry I was fucking around  And we laugh about it 
[00:26:00]  I go  It's all good dude  That's what we do in here  And it's like you're walking around  Holding a fucking grudge about it  So what?  That's the way I am  Why the grudge?  Because you have been trashed by a lot of people Troy  Well it just  He's just what  I don't know  Joe just rubs me the wrong way  And I thought we were cool  We were  And I thought we were now  You took all these fucking bullshit shots  And I was like  What was the shot that got you?  And so did you  Oh yeah  It's just  It's a skateboard thing  Pulling it out of the fucking blue  Just pulling it out of the blue  Jesus  Out of the fucking blue  It's all right  Troy listen  And I'm allowed to not like you 
[00:26:30]  Yeah  Okay that's fine Troy  I want you to listen  But you're carrying a lot of anger  I want you to go home today  I want you to really turn that house music up loud  I want you to work through it  Do a nice hard workout to it today  And get this out of your system  Because I apologized that day  And go  Troy I was fucking around  We're friends  Just like we all fuck around  Like how is that an insult?  That's stupid  Because you don't listen to house music right?  Well yeah I listen to house music  Of course I listen to house music  I DJ house music  Of course  But why is that an insult?  It's like  Joe why is that an insult?  Because I thought it was  That's because you're not funny 
[00:27:00]  Oh  Wow  You're taking it to the level  Now that's  True  I might not be  I might not be funny  And comedy  You know  But it's  I don't know  How do you call yourself a comedian?  At least I  Really?  Really?  Really?  Holy shit  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  Because I make my fucking living  From it  You know what I don't do?  I can't believe you  I'll tell you  Is work at a fucking radio show  All day  And then pretend to be a DJ  At night  How does that pretend?  Because you don't 
[00:27:30]  Then go make your living  Being a DJ  I make more money DJing  Than I do here  Then why are you here?  Because why not?  Why?  Are you here to promote  Your DJ sets?  Well sometimes yeah  Are you here to be part  Of the radio commute?  Why do you have another job  If that's such  If you're making real fucking money  Being a DJ  And that's your thing  Why do you have another fucking job?  Well I mean it's expensive  To live in New York  You know that  Yeah I know  And I enjoy doing both things  So what's wrong with that?  Paying bills with comedy  Does that show Girls?  You ever see that show?  It's like a lot of tension  Guys you gotta like  Bury the hatchet  You're both artists 
[00:28:00]  Alright  Good Dave  You're a comic writer  Author  He's a DJ and radio guy  So come on  Between the two of you  If you can't afford  A one bedroom somewhere  Between the two of you  And some help from your family  There's no reason  Why you guys can't  Rent a basement  Somewhere in  In Bay Ridge  So we should have  Is that funny dude?  Or not?  No it's good  You're hysterical  But Joe isn't  No  Joe is very funny  This is what  Wait so we shouldn't have Joe 
[00:28:30]  On the  We shouldn't have Joe  On the show anymore?  Are you asking my opinion?  Yeah  I think Joe's on too much  Whoa  What is this?  Egypt  Go deliver your fucking papers  And get somebody coffee  Or do whatever the fuck it is you do  I'm not trying to be funny  Get out of here while you can  Don't fucking do what you do  If you're such a fucking DJ  Go be a DJ  If you're not a fucking DJ  Then work in radio  But don't fetch coffee during the day  And DJ at night  And then come in here  I sit in a production studio  And work in Pro Tools all day  What do you do?  What do you do? 
[00:29:00]  I do all the imaging  That's on this fucking channel  Oh my god  Troy  Oh  Jesus  Jesus  The imaging?  Yeah  That's what I do  That's my job  What does that even mean?  That's like coffee  Of course you don't know  What the fuck that means  What does that mean Joe?  Wow  Bill Burrs in studio  Why is the part time rapper  Screaming at the part time DJ  Oh  Whoa  Troy  He'd either be a fucking comedian  Or be a rapper  Troy  Oh shit  Joe it's too early  To be yelling like this  Troy's got a problem  He's coming in with his problem 
[00:29:30]  I'm going to see you too  Bill let me explain really fast  These two went at it  I don't know  A month or two ago  And made fun of how  Each other dresses  And it was a funny little bit  Everyone laughed  And it was a little ugly  But we got through it  But Troy Kwan is still  Holding a grudge  So we invited him  In here today  To try to find out  Why the fuck  Is he holding a grudge  And he's holding his ground  Like a man  Now he's saying  That Joe DeRose  Is not funny  He said he was a faggot  He said he saw him  Sucking a guy's cock  Out by the dumpster 
[00:30:00]  I can see  I can see all of it  Oh yeah yeah  Sure  I mean if he asked my opinion  I gave it  That's what it is  Troy I get it  Troy you wear it on your sleeve  Troy you don't pull any punches  I get it  Talking to Kenny  About interrogation  He's letting me know  The way he's standing  Is a very defensive  Very defensive  Yet confident  Troy Kwan arms crossed  He's angry  Well Joe  Because you're attacking  His dream here  I mean I came in  In the middle of it  You just sound like  A very mean  Mean spirited person  The part where he said  I wasn't funny  That he doesn't get  How I'm a comic  You missed all that  That was a retort 
[00:30:30]  Troy doesn't even know  How he makes money in comedy  That was a fucking retort  That's the truth  Oh man  I don't know  I've ever told anybody  That wasn't a 19 year old  Hipster trick  That you were trying to  Finger in the back  Of a fucking dance  Now that fucking  Now I'm getting  Insulted there Joe 
[00:31:00]  Wow Joe  That was a little too much  And I'm sorry  Come on now  Troy comment  I don't even know  I wasn't even paying attention  That's what it is  Communication  Troy you work in radio  You guys have to go  On a zipline trip somewhere  I don't see why  There's such a big thing  You guys like are both  Two you know  Dudes like New York  I figure you guys  Would go out  And hit the scene  Look here's why  There's a thing  Is because we fucked around  I apologized to him 
[00:31:30]  Three times a day  And Troy I would say  Got the fucking better of me  That day on the show  Oh absolutely  I went after him  Oh boy  It's just  Dr. Steve got the best of you  The last time you were on  Jesus  I mean one second  I mean no offense  To Dr. Steve  But  Yeah Joe  It's this world coming to  Yeah  Let me finish my point  Because this guy's such a  Fucking hot headed little girl  That you can't even fuck  As opposed to the  Even keeled  Joe DeRosa  Joe DeRosa  You walked in  Joe was screaming  Four hours sleep  Oh yeah  I wanted to go back to bed 
[00:32:00]  When I heard that  DJing in a best bar  You're the fucking  I'm like Jesus Christ  I just want to come in  And say hi to the guys  Have a fucking  Breakfast sandwich Joe  Well let Joe finish his point  Here's my point  This is why I'm fucking  Worked up about it  Is because  That's why I'm hot  Under the collar  We did the thing  And again  I'm admitting  I'm saying Troy  Got the fucking  Better of me that day  And I even said  On the fucking air  Multiple times  Troy 
[00:32:30]  I came at you  For no reason  You know how it is  Sometimes you want to  Trash people  And I just came after you  I shouldn't have done that  And he can't let it go  Yeah I can't  He can't let it go  So that's fine  That he can't let it go  I wasn't screaming at you  When you walked in here  Because you couldn't let it go  I started fucking yelling at you  Because you're sitting there now  Taking shots at my fucking livelihood  And trying to get me off the fucking show  What kind of fucking man are you  Serious  First of all  Like I said  Opie asked my opinion  And I asked him  I said  Do you want to know my opinion  That's my opinion  I know I love it  Wow 
[00:33:00]  Oh I forgot  And the biggest bitch move of all  You're taking shots at my livelihood  So go fuck yourself  After you took shots at mine  You're going to dish it out  Stop taking shots at each other's livelihoods  Take a knee ladies  Take a knee  Exactly  By the way Bill  Joe don't point at me at my livelihood  Don't you point at me at my livelihood  Who the fuck says livelihood  Livelyhood  My livelihood  Is this Bormark Empire  What's going on  We've got to move that hooch  By the way  And you come in here 
[00:33:30]  And you're taking shots at my livelihood  By the way  You're going to get that tattooed on your own  You fucking moron  Holy shit  Why don't you go after him a little bit  Why are you coming at me  Because you're the one I heard screaming  Yeah and you missed the first half of it  He's keeping his composure  That's right  His tattoos are more colorful  You're right  Because you never scream ever  You're a real quiet guy  Joe if anybody knows  This is fucking anger time  Joe you've been yelling livelihood 
[00:34:00]  At like 8 and 19 in the morning  Here's my point  That's wrong with you  As soon as he said  Levity lies  Joe I don't care  As soon as he said  I don't care  Sit down Joe  It got ugly  As soon as he said  That he wouldn't go after a guy like Patrice  That he wouldn't go after a guy like Patrice  But he'd come after a guy like me  That's a fucking bullshit thing  Joe this is supposed to be  An enjoyable experience  It is  I'm having a great time  Obviously  Joe all of a sudden  By the way  For you listeners  Joe bolted to his feet  At a certain point  In this conversation  You just bolted to your feet  I'm sitting back there 
[00:34:30]  I thought it was going to be a fight  Somebody was attacking his livelihood  Joe is Troy wearing the proper sneakers today?  Look  I'm not going to add fuel to the fire  Okay  You don't like him though?  Fuel to the fire  And your livelihood  God damn it  Why don't you two just use a little elbow grease  And try to  Catch things up  Joe's been yelling for 45 minutes  And then goes  I'm not going to add fuel to the fire  He should have  He should have wrote a book on puns  Yeah look at you  How about this guys  That's not a pun  Fellas  Fuel to the fire  Fellas  Now I'm embarrassed 
[00:35:00]  If we take you two  And we just tie your legs or arms together  In some kind of Star Trek kind of fight  With just one new iPhone  Right  And you have to beat the other guy to death with it  Would you do it?  No  If the winner doesn't get the eye  You wouldn't do it?  No  Okay good  I don't think that's right  Can we have closing statements?  I love all this fake seriousness here  By the way  This is what's wrong with today's comedy  No I was just  Honestly I'm just saying  If you go to any comedy club in America right now  This is happening to some degree  Which is like  Somebody taking a comment way too seriously 
[00:35:30]  And then the comic having to defend way too hard  And then back and forth  And you know  And then it gets way too serious sounding  Yeah  There you go  Well dude  I actually think they're just reading like a Twitter argument  Like I don't think this is any of the dialogue  Transcripts from our school  I'm not gonna lie  I'm fucking pissed off  It's like when a guy  When a guy comes in and goes  Goes  Hey man  I don't fucking take shit  With this  With this brash editor  And then says  Well I wouldn't go at Patrice  Because you know  You pick your battles  That's fucking bitch shit  Okay  He's coming in here  He's trying to bitch me out 
[00:36:00]  He's fucking telling you guys  I'm on the show too much  He's trying to fuck with me  And it's bullshit  I fucking apologize to you like a man  And if you had a fucking problem with it that day  You should have told me you had a problem with it that fucking day  Well it stewed with me a little bit  And you know what  Like a little girl for fucking two months about it  If you're so confident in your fucking comedic abilities  What does my opinion matter?  Troy it's just  It's just something you don't do  Why?  Who cares?  It's like a customer that goes and complains  And goes  I want my money back  I'm offended  I don't like the taste of these wings  Can I have my money back?  It's just fucking lying shit 
[00:36:30]  What do you think about these wings?  And you give your opinion about it  OBS my opinion  I don't think you're funny  I don't know why  You don't think I'm funny since I fucked with you that day  I don't know if I've ever really ever thought  You've said anything funny on this show  You've come to my shows  Wow Troy  You've come to my stand up shows  And I couldn't leave  And you told me I was funny after  Holy shit  And you told me I was funny after  Why did you lock the doors at your comedy show so no one could leave  I'm here pulling  I brought a date  This is true  Basically I didn't tell him that though 
[00:37:00]  I brought a date and I was embarrassed  I was embarrassed  Oh Troy shut the fuck  It's true  You were embarrassed  This is livelihood  Then why did you go out of your way to tell me how funny you thought the show was  I said I had a great show just as in like  Hey good job buddy  Troy you know what  Go fuck yourself  Go fuck yourself  I hope you fall off a fucking DJ riser and split your head open  That's not funny  I really fucking do  I really do  I hope you have a fucking OD on whatever ecstasy you're taking at this fucking rape tonight  Nothing would make me happier than seeing you convulse and foam from the fucking mouth on the floor  It would really make me fucking happy 
[00:37:30]  This is some good stuff Troy  He's a comedic genius over here  Joe DeRosa  Have you ever seen him live  So let's hear your opinion on his craft  Good question David  I was there  I had my lunch that's ready to go  People have stopped being polite  And are starting to get real  I felt that the beats weren't blending properly  There you go  It's all criticism guys  Do you have respect for DJs?  I love DJs  Not what he does  But I respect that 
[00:38:00]  I respect that  DJs that cut and shit  You're taking shots at their livelihood  It's not a livelihood when you do it for free at night  That's not a livelihood  I get paid a lot of money  That's not a job  Then quit here  Why do I have to?  I make money doing a copy  You see me running around fucking imaging  If you do two things  If you do two different things  Why not do both?  That was a good show  That was very good  Bill  That was funny right?  You walked right into the fucking  You know the hornet's nest here  I literally said 
[00:38:30]  I said you want me to stay outside  Until this blows over?  No no no  I wanted you to come in here  The more the merrier with this shit  It was really just a simple question  I didn't realize  Wow  He was angry  Classic case  Dishing out but can't take it  It's okay when we fuck with E-Rock  It's okay when we fuck with Sam  It's okay when I get fucked with  When Ant or Opie gets fucked with  Hey leave me out of this  When Bobby gets called fat for 90 minutes straight  That's mean  That's all fine  But you know  But Troy  You know  Okay it's precious ground  I'm sorry Troy  I didn't know  I didn't know you were off limits  No I'm not off limits  Take shots  But I'm going to go back after you 
[00:39:00]  So  And you did  Yeah  So go back after me  Don't carry a fucking grudge about it  And be angry  It's the way I am  It's just the way I am  Well then you suck  Then be careful who you go after  No  No  Okay well then you have to deal with yourself  Then you have to deal with this then  Okay  No I don't actually  You have to be dealing with getting bitched up by somebody  That's not a fucking comedian  No I don't actually  Because guess who doesn't have to be here every day  I mean that's just the way it is  You got totally fucking bitched up  By somebody that's not even a comedian  No I didn't get totally bitched up  You got totally fucking bitched up  Oh Troy  You got bitched up that day  The next time you're on  Fucking Dr. Steve bitched you up  Oh Dr. Steve served me nice  I'll admit that fully 
[00:39:30]  Because you're a stupid punk motherfucker  People are getting served  People are getting bitched up  There's likelihood being attacked  What's going on in here  Well we're trying to turn this to Jerry Springer  Go make a picture  Get fatter  Go go  Get a big fat belly hanging over  Oh jeez  Sorry I don't do curls  To try to fuck 17 year olds  You fucking fat  There you go  Let's look at this  Oh wow  Yeah I don't think  Sorry Troy  Should I stay in safe  To try to fuck high school girls  At the race  Is that what I should do Troy  When you're fucking girls 
[00:40:00]  They jiggle your tits  Is that what I should do  Is that what I should do Troy  Because when you're on top of a bitch  Sitting there jiggling your tits  Like this  Yeah Troy  Make a lesbian joke now  I haven't heard this before  Come on Troy  I'm waiting for you to make one joke  Wow  I'm waiting to hear you say something fucking funny  Troy I joke around with people I like  I don't fucking like you  How about that  Well I don't like you either  I don't fucking like you  You're a pussy  So are you  You're a fucking pussy  Who saw this coming  I didn't  Wow this is going to be  The awkwardest elevator ride ever 
[00:40:30]  I mean ever  We never ride the elevator together  He's not allowed to leave until 5 o'clock  He's not making his best production things  I'll walk out with you today  How about that motherfucker  Oh  We're going to fight now  I'll take you across the street  I'll jiggle your tits across the street  Oh you want to fight me now Troy  I'll kiss you on your lips  Is that where you want to take this  I would fight  I'd love to fight you  We're not going to fight Troy  I'm not going to fucking fight you  This is sexual tension  What the fuck is wrong with you  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  No I'm not going to shut the fuck up  You came in here asking for something  I'm giving it to you 
[00:41:00]  They called me in  Well what do you want  I gave my opinion to somebody  The staff he wanted to the show  So that sort of turned into  Like a hipster Steven Seagal movie  Troy you could have pulled me aside  And said dude  I didn't appreciate that  And I would have said Troy  I'm sorry  But if you don't think  I can leave until 5 o'clock  I'll walk out with you  I'll just ride the elevator down with you  What do you think of that  Jesus fucking Christ  Go ahead Troy  I blame it on that movie  Would I just be scared  That you want to ride the elevator down with me  Well you said I can't do that  So watch  Watch me do it motherfucker  You know he could hit all the floors  And that takes a long time  Exactly  That would piss me off 
[00:41:30]  Well I'm going to just wait  And say Joe is very funny  And if you guys have a problem  Now it's to the next level  So I think the gloves are off  You guys should really go at it  You know  Maybe something for charity  Maybe something for charity  Maybe something for charity  A boxing match  Do we got an agree to disagree situation  In the studio right now  We got an agree to  No I think that they were working  Towards an understanding  A solution  Yeah  Should we have closing statements  It felt like it tipped  And we were like  Kind of maybe going to get there 
[00:42:00]  I was being sarcastic  Now it's over  I was being sarcastic  Now it's over  I really thought it got so heated  That we were going to tip it  To like fuck it  Now there's no way  Come over here like a man  Ugh  Should we do closing statements?  Well I would just say  I thought Troy and I were friends  And I thought  I'm sorry Dave  I cut you off  I didn't mean to  I was just going to say  I think the audience  Did decide by downloading your album  What's it called?  Sorry to be the Jew here  Might as well make a little money  Off your terror  I'm sorry Joe 
[00:42:30]  I stepped on you  No I was just going to say  I thought Troy and I were friends  You know what  Troy I'll say it to you directly  You got some sad music  To play underneath  I thought you and I  Hang on  Go ahead  What kind of sad do you think?  Like the good wife  That kind of stuff  Everybody hurts  Oh that's not  E-Rock  There you go  Everybody hurts  That's a missing somebody  Kind of tune  I thought  Hold on hold on  We don't have the music yet  Eagle's Nest to E-Rock  Yeah we don't  Because Troy's in charge of the music  Great idea  I was just going to say that  Okay Joe

[00:44:30]  Pass the mic Joe  That's it  Is he being funny now?  Trying to be serious  What song do you want  Troy for your closing statement?  A literal Joe DeRosa  No just something nice  Something sweet  Any other sad songs out there?  I have a feeling  Troy's not going to be  So sentimental in his retort  Well let's see what happens  We got his music down  But that was sincere  I meant every fucking word of that  Hey Joe  The music fit with what  You were saying  Perfectly  Troy  Your closing statement  That's fine  Look we don't have to be  We can be okay 
[00:45:00]  I mean  You know  If you take a shot at me  You know  I'm not a comedian  I don't come in here  And hang like that  Apparently neither is Joe  According to you  Well yeah exactly  But he wants  This is my fucking problem  Wait  You were trying to  Close the statement  I just tossed a gas can  You were going to  Stand it up again  You were going to  Shake it  What happened to the  Closing statement?  He's got to keep  Throwing his cram shit  Man that fucking  Bucks me  That bucks me  Don't say  Don't  We can't 
[00:45:30]  It's like a four year old  We can't get a big  Cookie than I did  What happened to the  Closing statement?  We came to an agreement  I said this is the  Fourth fucking time  I put my hat in my hand  To this guy  And tried to apologize  And he just comes back  And keeps slamming  And then he walks around  And talks shit about me  It's a fucking  Not talking shit  I'll say everything  To your face  Fuck it  I misspoke  I take back my apology  Oh man  Wow  Dave Attell  Levity lie  My God  I don't want to apologize 
[00:46:00]  Wow  Should we still get  Troy's closing statement?  If you want it  You think I give a shit  Well I don't  Troy your closing statement  Please  It's fine  I don't have to  I don't have to like Joe  I don't have to think  He's funny  I don't make the decisions  Of who gets booked here  And who doesn't get booked here  Whoa  Thank God  We're cool  This is like  How long can you talk  To Tony Hawk 
[00:46:30]  Exactly  Jesus  There's a lot of anger  In that  So Tony  We're going to have  Bam Margera  Come in  How about that rap  We're fine  Everything's fine  Should we go for  Open mouth kiss  What do you want to do  He's the hug  Hug  Should we do the hug  Joe  Come on Joe  I'd rather not  He's going to grab your titties  We're fine  Joe it's a symbolism  For all the countries  That don't get along  In the world  We're fine  I'd like to just leave it  We're fine  We're fine  No hugs  No hugs  Troy you'd hug them  Come on  It's a new year 
[00:47:00]  According to the  Joe  A hug  The heaves  You know what  I have been around  I have been around  Comedians  This entire  Little radio  Funny crazy  Wacky thing  I've done  And the worst thing  You could tell  A comic  Is that he's not funny  Yeah that was  That is the  That is  That is  The  Saying nigger  Of comedy  Wow  That is  It is  It's true  It is  That's the  Atom bomb  Of what you could  Say to a comic  It's true  Do you feel 
[00:47:30]  Joe did anything  That warranted  Such a strong response  That was a really  Mean fucking thing  To say  Troy  It's just an opinion  That's all  I think  I think Joe's  Very funny  But as you heard  From Joe  I'm just a fucking  Drunk  So what do I know  Way to go  Joe  Way to go  Way to go  Joe  Troy  Way to go  One guy on your side  That was a shitty  Thing to say  And up until that  Point  I didn't mention  DJ stuff that you're  Doing  I didn't mention  Your job here  When you took it  There  That's when it 
[00:48:00]  Started to go  That's fine  Carol gets upset  With Alice  You're missing my point  Troy  I'm saying  You took it to a place  Where you got real  Fucking real with it  Why don't you guys  Just both go to like  Magnolia  You know  Maybe split a cupcake  Or something  Sex in the city  That you own on  Box set Joe  I love the show  That's what it is  There you go  Joe  At least a handshake  A handshake  And it started out  With Joe fucking  Dissing shoes  That sounds very  Sex in the city  I want you both 
[00:48:30]  To go in the other room  Each draw your own  Flag of yourself  And then each one  Gets to burn it  Okay  Let's end this  Midi style  It really is  Handshake Joe  No I just think  We should just leave  No handshake  Troy you'd handshake  There's such  Mutual animosity  Yeah of course  He doesn't think  You're funny  Come on Joe  He'll handshake  Your hand  No I'd rather not  I'd rather just leave  Wow that's not  Going to help things  We're fine  It's good  Handshake makes it  All better  Joe  Not in 2012  Come on  This is going to be good  Look  David Tell  Insists on it 
[00:49:00]  He really does  I can see Joe's point of view  I can see Troy's point of view  To some degree  But you know  The fact that like  You know  He comes in here  You know  I don't think he  Comes in here too much  And it's always  Whatchamacallit  It's not like he just shows up  He's invited right  Yes  We're going to have to  Re-evaluate obviously  Apparently you're on  Too much there  You're such a fucking dick  We might have to  Re-evaluate  We take what Troy  Says very  You know  Very seriously  Troy has his finger 
[00:49:30]  On the pulse  Of the youth  That's right  And we want to  We're older gentlemen  We like to hear  The voice of  Someone that might be  A little younger  I think  Lives overlap  Yes yes yes  They both do the music thing  That is true  You know  I think that's  That's where they  The friction happened  It's that competition  What if it turns out  They're the only two matches  For bone marrow  Oh wow  That would be  Oh my god  Here's my sitcom  I've been looking for it  There it is  Not even a handshake  No  No we're fine 
[00:50:00]  I want to leave you  Joe if you just  Shake his hand  We can move on  As Anthony just said  Yes  A man who has livelihood  Would Hemingway  Shake Oscar Wilde's hand  Probably not  Be an author dude  Stole him out or something  As Anthony said  Shane you're not funny  Is like saying nigger  To a comedian  Whatever  It's like  Minus the 400 years of slavery  200 whatever the hell  I don't know why you're so shocked  I'm sure somebody  Stole you that before  Club owner oppression  Come on  You've been through it  And we're back in  We're back in 
[00:50:30]  I'm just sure  I'm just sure  You see what I mean  This is why  I won't shake his fucking hand  We were in remission  For a while  But it came back  This is why  I won't shake his hand  Because he's doing  This is why  Actually this is why  He's standing up again  Joe's up  Joe's up  This is why  I didn't shake his hand  Because this  When it was his turn  To do the thing  And you guys go  Is it cool  And he goes  No we're fine  We're fine  As if it's up to fucking Troy  And Troy only  If we're fine  Like he's the godfather  And I've got to go to him  Begging for fucking mercy 
[00:51:00]  It's like  Look we're fine  It's cool  We don't have to talk  We don't have to  There's going to be  Weirdness  But I'm not fucking  Shaking hands  I'm not hugging  And we're not going to  He takes every opportunity  To bash you  Exactly  Every single fucking chance  No matter how many times  I go  Let's just fucking squash it  But hold on Joe  Troy what did you think  Of his impression of you  Now that was pretty good  Dead on  Huh  Nothing  That's pretty good  That's tough  This is ONA's  Worst of 2012  On the O.B.

[01:00:30]  Or the latest employee  That we've hired on this show  And everyone thinks  Sal's kind of a hipster  I think Sam thinks  He's kind of a douche bag  And I don't know what Roland thinks  But everyone thinks  Sal's kind of a  Hipster-ish if you will  And so we're going to do  A little segment here on him  First part being about his production  Sal actually  Handed in a sweeper  He rushed it in  It was so important  For a fight that Tom Papa  Was having with Roland  Sal runs in with this  And it turns out to be  Complete garbage  So here's the guy  Shitting on Sal's production  Right now  This is O.P. and Anthony's 
[01:01:00]  Worst of 2012  Hi  I don't know if I like the sound effects  In the Uncle Paul bit  What?  I like the Uncle Paul bit  But I don't know if I need  Sound effects  Splashing  Really?  You didn't like that?  We know what a splash  Sounds like  Exactly  That's true  Sal do that?  Yeah  Oh boy  No problem  Problem?  Problem?  Yeah I'll splash it up  Yay!  The creaky door  Yeah 
[01:01:30]  It was a little much  Fucking Z100  You're right  After the angry panda thing  This is not good for Sal  I heard that on your after show  Sam  The other day  And  Well Sal  Remember when Sal  Made  It was a little thing for Roland  Who we call the angry panda  Because like  He's a big lovable  Kind of guy  He looks harmless  And  He got a little giggle  And everything  But then when he gets pissed  He's the most notorious 
[01:02:00]  Horrific guy  To get in an argument with  Yeah he's vicious  Vicious  Vicious  So you know  It was kind of like  I would call him the angry panda  It's kind of a good  It's an affection term  A term of affection  Endearment  Guy who over explains  A term of friendship  Okay  And then  Sal  Thought  He was going to  Propel himself  Into the world  Of  Genius  And production  And show his talents off  By making a 
[01:02:30]  Quick sounder  For the show  Whenever we  Whenever Roland gets mad  With this angry panda thing  And it  It literally  Killed  Using angry panda  If you remember  He ran in  Like middle of the segment  Oh yes  Guess what  I've got the spice  This segment needs  It's the cherry on top  Sal is going to be  A legend after this  Yeah he thought  He was  Fucking in  And it stinks  Oh boy  It wound up  Killing that  We don't even call him  Angry panda anymore  Because it just 
[01:03:00]  It was so bad  Listen to this  It sounds  Let me just tell you  The voicing  Is terrible  The sound itself  Is horrible  And it sounds  Very amateurish  Okay  Yeah  Fuck him  It does  Fuck him  It does  It is what it is  It is what it is  What am I supposed to  Sounds like an ambulance  Fake it  Let's listen  Don't  Get  The  Panda  Angry  And a lion 
[01:03:30]  That's the whole thing  That's it  Yeah  And we're supposed to play that  Whenever  Whenever  Roland gets mad  And we would be like  That's fucking brilliant  Yeah  I wish the fucking lion  In that bit  Would have eaten him  Halfway through recording that  So I never had to hear it  It's so bad  It looks like Jim liked it  That's fucking terrible  Isn't it horrible  Yeah cause that lion  First of all  That's the lion roar  From Exorcist 3 
[01:04:00]  Oh  Whenever the fucking demon  Would roar  And it would trail off  Into a lion roar  You hear that again  Yeah  Listening to the voice too  It doesn't  It doesn't have a powerful thing  It's cheesy  Yeah  Effects are put on it  Whose voice is that  I think it's Sal's  Oh  Oh Sal had to do it himself  It's Sal's voice  And it's layered right  Yeah  Sal it's terrible  Yeah it stinks  Sal are you humiliated  By that piece  It was the  The biggest regret I've had  Since I've come here  He's so  He's so humiliated by it  He's never even tried again 
[01:04:30]  And he won't  He will never again  Try to do a piece of production  Let's hear the funny Roland thing  Like if Roland gets upset  Let's see what happens  We play this  Yeah yeah  Roland's getting mad  Oh shit  Don't get the panda angry  And it's so long  Yeah  You would have to sit there  You would have to sit through that  30 seconds or whatever it is  You guys talk  The panda is still  Is still talking  What's the explosion  Well that's the explosion  That turns a panda into a lion 
[01:05:00]  It's a panda lion bomb  A panda lion  It's a gene pool explosion  That's terrible  That's  Yeah  It's yelling  The sound of DNA splicing  It's not a powerful yell  It's sort of a  No it sounds like the fucking  Boy king from fucking  Game of Thrones shouting  Don't get that panda angry  Oh god  Sal sucked  I know  It's terrible  I apologize  Yeah  I hate the slow  But by the way  Purposeful diction  One more time  He didn't think it was terrible 
[01:05:30]  When he  Before you said it was terrible  He didn't think it was terrible  No he thought it was great  Don't get the panda angry  Picture him by the way  When we listen to it here again  Picture him in the studio  In front of the mic  Yelling this  Because I would have loved to have seen a video of it  I bet you he held his headphones  Yes  When he fucking yelled  He probably had his hands on his stupid headphones  Yeah  To get the full sound of his own  That's a good one  Teenage girl voice  Yeah you don't have a powerful voice 
[01:06:00]  That's right  It's terrible  Let's hear  Don't get the panda angry  Oh sorry  What a douche  Oh man  You suck  That is fucking terrible  It's so douchey  Isn't that hideous?  I hate it  And I just don't get  Like a drop should be like two seconds

I don't know  I just gotta work on whatever  I guess these guys can say whatever they want when they come in here now  The Anger Panda thing was the most embarrassing thing  It's Anger Panda  It still is  It's humiliating that you even brought it up again  Please don't  Don't get the panda angry  Oh my god  That's terrible  Oh my god  That's not even a panda  It's a lion  There it is 
[01:10:30]  And then after this Uncle Paul thing  It's all strikeouts for this kid  Yeah  It fucking stinks  Fucking stinks  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Continuing on with Sal, our hipster guy here  He's at Sal617 on Twitter  If you want to reach out and follow him  Or whatever you want to do with that information  Sal had a problem now with me  Because Sal thinks that anything that I was delegating to him  Is that why does he have to do my work 
[01:11:00]  Why can't he just do things he wants to do  Picture yourself coming into a workplace  Brand new  You don't want to ruffle any feathers if you will  You want to make your way through the company  And somebody gives you work for your brand new position  And you think  I'm just going to make up my own job description and details  And figure out something that I want to do  Does that always work?  No  And Sal takes a beating on this one  It's Sal vs. me  Right now  And I hear there's a little something going on behind the scenes  Yeah, what's going on? 
[01:11:30]  What's going on?  I don't know  I want to hear this  You want me to tell him?  Or do you want to explain your side?  You brought it up  Enough teasing  I want to hear  Yeah, what's up?  I don't know  Over the last two days  Sal has just become completely  Not only fed up  But just straight up disrespectful  To Eric  In front of everybody  Wow  Wow, what's that about?  Like being like  Eric would be like  Hey, will you do this for me?  Yeah  And Sal would be like  Fuck you  That's his response to him  Sal trying to get fired? 
[01:12:00]  I don't know  It started  Sal tweeted a picture  Of E-Rock  Looking up some random news story  Doing nothing for the show  Oh, shit  And he posted a picture  Of his watch  In the photo  That said like  Eleven  Whatever  Oh, no  As if to say  E-Rock's doing no work  Because Sal has vocally said  He's frustrated  That he has to do  E-Rock work  And E-Rock doesn't have to do that work  Uh-huh  So then  You know  I told E-Rock  And told him  In front of everybody  I was like  You can't  Let Sal do this to you  I said 
[01:12:30]  You let me  And Travis  And Danny  And all these guys  Do it to you  And then you get walked on  Sal's the new guy  You can't let him do it to you  Yeah, you gotta alpha mail him  So Sal was kind of  He was taking shots at him too  He was making fun of him  For asking Roland for free DVDs  He was making fun of him  For getting shit signed  He was going in on him  E-Rock hit him in the head  With a magazine  Oh, shit  That was the big comeback  E-Rock smacked him  With a magazine  But then  Sal  Violence in the workplace  Sal had a bitch fit about it 
[01:13:00]  About how  I just don't understand  The physical  Blah, blah, blah, blah  And threw this whole bitch fit  To the point where  E-Rock  Texted Sal  Said  I apologize  Oh, cause E-Rock's afraid  Of the workplace  And then the next morning  Bought him breakfast  E-Rock is a fucking  E-Rock's a work cuckold  Sal  I went to hear this  This was yesterday  Now we're up to  Sal responded  To  Having the apology  And a free breakfast  By announcing  To me 
[01:13:30]  Roland  Travis  And Troy  With E-Rock  Right in the room  He vocally said  You know  I would've  Like he was a piece of shit  He said  I would've respected him more  If he hadn't apologized  Oh, shit  But he had to turn around  And apologize to me  And buy me breakfast  Oh, man  Then Eric comes in  And he goes  He goes  Hey, I got some  Live reads  I need you to bring them  Downstairs for me  That's what he said  Uh-huh  Okay  Sure  Sal turns around  And goes  What? 
[01:14:00]  And Eric goes  I got some  Live reads  I just need you  To bring them down  To the traffic department  For me  On 19  And he goes  What?  What the fuck?  No  I'm not gonna bring  Shit down for you  You can use the exercise  Bring them down yourself  Go walk in traffic  Go walk in traffic  Good one  And we're all just  Sitting there going  What?  And Sal leaves for the day  He goes up to Eric  And he goes  Alright, Eric  I'm leaving  I'll bring them down for you  Write down exactly  Where they need to go  Eric took like five minutes  He found a pen 
[01:14:30]  He found a post-it  He wrote down exactly  Where they need to go  And he goes  Here you go  And Sal reads it  And he looks at Eric  And he goes  Good  Now you know  Where to fucking bring them  And he put them down  On his desk  And walked out  Wow  Holy shit  And I was like  What's going on?  What the fuck?  Sal?  Sal  That's exactly what happened  I didn't misrepresent anything  Now why  What's the problem, Sal?  Well, I was  I'm just getting fed up  With this shit  Pretty much  With the shit  Around here 
[01:15:00]  Or just with him?  No, mainly with Eric  Yeah  It's just like  I used to like  Look down at Troy  For like always bitching  About Eric  And all that sort of stuff  But now  I've gotten to the point  Where I completely understand it  Now why is that?  Wow  What happened?  What put you over the edge?  It's just the stupid  The stupid shit like that  Like  Like he  He initiated a job  But couldn't complete it  And had to pull a power move  By telling me to go downstairs  To bring a piece of paper downstairs  It's like  Just do it yourself  I'm working on other shit  That I need to get done 
[01:15:30]  But it sounded like  You started like  Getting on him  Before that point  I mean you tweeted the picture out  And all that  Yeah  That was just a  And he is your intern  That broke the camel  I'm not an intern anymore  That's not nice  Oh see  I  No that was just the straw  That broke the camel  You know you're going to be  Messing with the Iraq army  You can say it  Nigga  I don't want to mess around  With that army  But no  It's just that like  I completely understand  You feel like you're an equal  To Iraq at this point right?  Not an equal  You feel above him  Above Iraq now  Oh above Iraq 
[01:16:00]  Let me ask you this  Iraq's been working in radio  For a certain amount of time  Oh my god  Fucking  It's got to be what  30, 40 years now  He is a Doogie Houser  He started very young  Yeah  You've been working in radio  Doogie big as a Houser  There's a Doogie on my Houser  So stupid  Sal you've been working in radio  How long?  A year  Oh  Who do you think? 
[01:16:30]  No not a year  You just got hired  Yeah  April  You're counting your internship  Six months  Okay  Six months  You be honest  And don't be  Be as you would be  In the back  I don't know if you're sure  Who do you think  Is more skill?  You or Iraq?  When it comes to  O&A related stuff  I'd say  I'd say Eric  Without a doubt  Eric knows all those references  He has that like  Built up library  You know  He knows all that  That ins and outs of the show  But  I think if like  Something needs to get like  Produced technically  I can absolutely do better  Than Eric 
[01:17:00]  What about work ethic wise?  Just generally  Work ethic  Work ethic?  Uh  And in terms of like  Pawning off responsibilities  I mean I don't pawn off anything  I get everybody's shit  That they pawn off to me  So  So yeah  I definitely work  More  Than  Than Eric  Yeah  Wow  Wow  Bold statement there  And then Eric's gonna  Play the part like  Well I got you hired here  Or all that sort of stuff  And  Did he?  Everyone seems to like  To drop that line on me  Around here  Yeah I got you hired 
[01:17:30]  I got you hired  I had nothing to do with it  I didn't even know you were hired  Until I read the email  Right  I said it was a mistake then  I still say it's a mistake now  Did it bother you  If Sam thinks you were  An error?  No I mean  I have respect for Sam  Because I know  The work that Sam does  He does a lot of  Things for the show  Fill me in someday  Exactly  We'd love to know  Evidence of this  It might have been an error  But there were  You know  His competition wasn't that good  No it was very bad  No it was horrible  I'll admit that  Iraq what's going on? 
[01:18:00]  Why aren't you saying anything?  Iraq comment  I was letting him speak  This is the same shit he pulled  When  You know  Before he was hired  When Kenny was  Constantly going to him  And said I need you to do this  I need you to do this  And then Sal blew up  Saying why do I have to do everything?  Oh boy  Are you entitled?  Well I think I'm  You're entitled?  No people  People have confidence in him  To do certain things  So when they constantly  Go to him to do it  Then all of a sudden  He starts pulling this shit  Why am I having to do everything?  Well why do you think 
[01:18:30]  He's getting on your shit?  Because he thinks  It's an easy way  To carry favor with  With the staff  And maybe with the show  Because he doesn't feel like  The show likes him  Really?  That's not the case  If you're the one  Who's directly giving me  The most amount of work  On a consistent basis  That you could easily  Just do yourself  And I'm told from other people  Hey delegate it to Sal  So I go  Great  Let's do that  Who are these other people?  Name names  Name names  Iraq doesn't name names  Name names stupid  You're talking about Rob Cross? 
[01:19:00]  Rob Cross is one of them  And he'll openly admit  That certain things  He said we should delegate  That to Sal  Okay  And that's what I do  So you think that's a good thing  By making you do less work  And giving me more work?  No  It's you're the new guy  So shit that other people  Don't really want to do  After this point  Can be given to you  And it's accepted  Oh boy  Maybe not by you  But by management  Saying yeah  Give it to Sal  Okay  That's fine  But it's not fine  Because you complain about it  Right  Well no  I think that's a dumb mentality 
[01:19:30]  Why would you want to take  More work away from Eric?  Okay so you're saying  That the bosses in the back  Are having a dumb mentality  Wait  Are you saying that Eric  Does not have too much work?  Like  Oh absolutely  Oh  So the literally he had  He gives to me  Oh  Oh shit  So you're saying like generally  People with a lot of work  Will then be like  You know what  You take care of this for me  But Eric doesn't have  That kind of work  Right  Because I'm sure there wasn't  A meeting when Sal was  Talked about being hired  And then was finally hired  What would Sal's responsibilities be? 
[01:20:00]  What could we give to Sal?  And why wasn't I included  In that meeting?  Because they haven't hired you yet  And it's their call  To decide what you're going to do here  So you were instructed  To give me work  That you previously did?  Yes  Okay  You think Eric went to the meeting  And said well  We'll just have Sal do my work  Because I don't want to do it  Well I'm sure there were things  He mentioned that  Yeah he wanted to not do anymore  Wow  Other people around here  Were also told  Hey you should delegate that to Sal  Right  That's why he's here  More importantly  I don't give a shit  About this fucking situation 
[01:20:30]  Whatsoever  That's fine  What the fuck is that  Well I  I started to think  I should have been driving home  This sounds like the after show  I was going to say  This is so  Want me to talk about Roland?  Holy shit  No I don't understand Roland  I realized listening to Roland  He slides his words together  And that's what makes it impossible to understand him  It's like Roland has a series of mini strokes while he's talking  Oh my god  I just heard you guys cackling like hens  Yeah  This is after show shit 
[01:21:00]  More awkward moments  I still  I mean I did it  Epic fail  And foul mouth rant  It's fucking terrible  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Worst of 2012  Continues  Next  This  Is  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Worst of 2012 for the Opie and Anthony show  My name is E-Rock  And this segment features Bonnie McFarlane 
[01:21:30]  To start off with  Bonnie McFarlane vs. Andrew Dice Clay  Dice had a little bit of a misunderstanding  When they were in Las Vegas  Dice wanted to take a picture with some of the guy comedians  And Bonnie wanted to get in the photo  Dice was like  No I just want to take one with the guys  We'll do one later  And Bonnie I guess went online  And said that Dice doesn't like female comics  Which of course pisses off Dice  And he goes into this whole rant thing  We try to resolve it  As Dice takes on Bonnie McFarlane right now

[01:25:00]  Alert the press  Yeah for her  What?  I'm telling you  Honestly  I know her  She's joking  That's not real  Oh then  My mistake  Maybe I had a wrong  Maybe I had a peg  Drone  I'm just going to  Call a friend  Yeah  Yeah  My hard feelings  I'm a pissy fucking guy 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  I'm a little misunderstanding  Sometimes  We got to have  On the wrong side  I get that  That happens sometimes  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Continuing on  With Bonnie McFarlane  And the worst of 2012  For the Opie and Anthony show  And surprise surprise  It features  Joe DeRosa  Apparently  Bonnie and Joe  Had a bit of a falling out  At this point  Bonnie and Voss are in studio  And Bonnie reveals that  You know  She shot one of those shorts  That Joe was doing  For Warner Music  And I guess  They kind of butted heads 
[01:26:00]  And Joe  Being ultra sensitive  That is  Didn't like  What Bonnie had to say  I guess  I don't know  This is all girl talk  As Joe DeRosa  Versus Bonnie McFarlane  Happens right now  Bonnie and DeRosa  Had a falling out  Really?  We're no longer speaking  Why?  What happened?  He  I was an asshole  I guess  According to him  Yeah you don't believe that  Wow Joe has a problem  Everywhere  When were you an asshole  Bonnie?  Well I did his  Everywhere she appeared  I did a short for him 
[01:26:30]  Where I played  I was in one of the shorts  Yes that's right  Mine did way better than yours  Okay  Fantastic  Well thank you  Thank you  Why didn't you call me  And you know  Tear me down for 20 minutes  Did you and him have a  Wait he teared you down?  So he  So when I did  By the way  Your short was very very funny  I didn't see it  I didn't watch it  You play a boss  Yes I wanted to play  I wanted to play the character  A little differently  And he didn't  Want me to  Which I thought was a little weird  That he wouldn't just let  People do it  However they wanted to do it 
[01:27:00]  You know he was like  You know  Cecil Beast DeMills  So he  So anyway I got there  He's a little more serious  Than I  He's a little intense  He was intense  But I was joking around  You guys did it intense?  And yeah we did it intense  I'm going to go  Terrible  I'm not doing this  It was a good story  And he interrupted  I'm not doing this  You did it intense  Terrible  I know it's a joke  But the problem is  It's a bad one  It had none of the makings  Of a joke 
[01:27:30]  Go ahead  It was wordplay  Let's give  Yeah  It was good wordplay  It's kind of  Uncomfortable story  I'm trying to get out of it  He's starting to love words  Is this really an uncomfortable story?  I feel bad  It's my wife and a friend  It's a real situation  It's more important than your friend  So as soon as Joe gets here  And he comes in  Bonnie what happened?  So I said to him  He was telling everybody  What the rundown was going to be  And I said  When do we order pizza?  And I was half joking  But half wanted pizza  You know what I mean?  But I would have went and gotten my own pizza 
[01:28:00]  I was just  Yeah yeah of course  Trying to kind of bust his balls about it  So that was irritating to him  He had to order pizza now  He said I put him in a situation  He got mad because you asked for pizza?  Yeah he had to buy the whole crew pizza  I said I would have paid for it  Joe's a chiseler  How many people were on the crew?  I don't know  There was a lot of people there  Like 12?  No it's a real  Yeah like there's one person  That just gets you signed shit  I mean I don't know how  There's five or six  But how many pizzas is it? 
[01:28:30]  He's thinking he's going to come in  I don't know  There was what  Well this was the other thing  So then we wanted half cheese  Half peppers and onions  And he wouldn't do it  He's like no  You'll get all cheese  And there was like three of us  That were like  Well we want peppers and onions  Just do it on half  And he was like no  Just cheese  What?  He was  Because he was controlling it  And then finally I was like  Joe just get it  And then he was like fine  And he got mad  And then it came  And then I  And I guess I  I might have  In front of the crew  And everything that 
[01:29:00]  You know  I was disrespecting  The  The director  The director  By forcing him to get half  But he's really mad?  Oh they don't talk  So then  They don't talk  Yeah yeah no  So then  So then  I spilled  A little piece  Of the  One of the peppers  On the  It's all over pizza?  In the thing  No it's  It gets worse  More than that  And then I went to clean up  But Joe started losing his mind  And I got embarrassed  In front of everyone  Where he was like 
[01:29:30]  Jesus Christ Bonnie  You're getting it all over  And I was trying to clean up  And then I go  It's not my fault  Which I guess  I shouldn't have yelled that  And walked out  You know  I was just  Whatever  And so then he was  This I find this all out later  By the way  I don't know this is happening  Okay  And  Then he was mad  That he had to clean up the pizza  And then I didn't go  Off the chair  Yeah I didn't go get water or anything  I just left  Because I did  It was a bad move on my part  I didn't  Well it's like I heart Huckabees  Yes  So  So  Then  Then stuff just kept happening 
[01:30:00]  And then  You know  I was  And then he wanted me to play  This really angry character  So then I had to be angry  Like  Whatever  And I would be angry  And then he got mad  That I was angry  At the shoot  But he wanted you to take it seriously  Right  But I wasn't allowed to be angry  In between shots  But I kind of had to  Because it was like a very  Yeah you play the  It was like exhausting  To try to just be like  Right right right  Method  So  He was kind of getting on my nerves  He's kind of intense  And whatever  And um 
[01:30:30]  I showed up unprepared  So  Well this is what happened  At the end  I knew all my lines  I was like  I had a character ready to go  That he wouldn't let me do  Anyway  What do you mean he wouldn't let you do a character  Hold on hold on  I wanted to play the character  A little more like  Yeah  Valley girl  And he wouldn't have it  No he wanted me to just be an angry  He didn't even want you to have peppers  On your pizza  Right no  He's controlling  He's like  He's like  A real director  So anyway  This happens  It's fine  I leave  I know we didn't have the greatest 
[01:31:00]  Shooting relationship  I guess at one point  While he was telling me what to do  I go  I really hate you  And  But you're joking  I was  But I was also trying to break the tension  Because it was getting  Too intense  Yeah  And that's my fucking  I don't know why  I think that'll help break tension  But I did  It sold somebody  So this all comes out later  So he calls me  I'm now  I'm in LA  And  I get a call from him  And he's  You know  The build up to that  He's going to tell me  Off 
[01:31:30]  Is 20 minutes  So I said  You know what  Can you just email it to me  Because I can't  I don't have time  Email the tell off  Yeah  Like  So he got mad  So then he started freaking out  And then  Whatever  So we're having this back and forth  And I kept hanging up on him  And then it was like  He kept texting me  And then  But every time he started  It's really funny  There's an attraction there  Every time he started  To tell me what was going on  Yeah  He would  He'd say  I'd say  I'd defend myself  And he'd go  I don't want you to talk 
[01:32:00]  Don't talk  Or he let me talk  For five minutes  And then he'd go  I let you talk  Now you let me talk  But what  And this is not on the set anymore  This is days later  This is days later  So he's not controlling  Hold on  I said to him at this point  I said  Look  I know what's going to happen  Right  I go  We're probably never going to work together  Again  Okay  But  Now you're risking a friendship  So do you really  Like what is going to be  The end result of this  Like do you really want to go through  With this  And he did  So I had to sit there  For 20 minutes  While he told me  Literally every 
[01:32:30]  Asshole move  He even went back to cheat  And he was like  You're an asshole  On cheat  He said no one liked you  No one liked you on that set  He said  No one liked you on this set  He said no  He goes  After you left  Everyone looked at me  And was like  What was her problem  You know  Like they had a meeting  About me after I left  Here's where  We thought she was  Everybody put  Why do you think  She's an asshole  On a piece of paper  And well let's talk about it  We got to get  Joe DeRose's side of the story  Absolutely  Oh he's got a side  Believe you me  I heard it for 20 minutes 
[01:33:00]  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Let me get in here  Because I like  Breaking shit down  I got to just add  One more thing  So that was  How long ago  I don't know  We were in LA  It was like  Months ago  Month and a half ago  Yesterday  I got a phone call  From him  I didn't pick up  I was like  Oh shit  Now I think  I should have picked up  And went  Well well well  But I didn't  I didn't pick up  And he left a nice message  About congratulations  On your movie 
[01:33:30]  And good luck  And it's a great movie  So he wants to be friends  And I told him  Alright but can I break it  What the fuck is this  Really about  It's not about  It's really about  That I'm an  Here's the thing  Are you an asshole  I really am an asshole  But it's my sense of humor  And I  I feel like my friends  Will know that  And I also  And you know  His problem was that  I disrespected him  Which I didn't  I didn't know  That I was going  Into a situation  Where I had to see  Joe DeRosa  As a different person  Right  Do you know what I mean  Like I thought  I got to be myself  And he got to be himself 
[01:34:00]  I didn't realize  Like from the jump  We're going to  Well I got  I got experience  I mean I did one with him  And I'm like  Wow that's the same  Joe that comes on our show  Holy fuck  Who do you  Why do you think  It's sexual tension  That's what you said  It's obvious  Bonnie's a good looking lady  Come on  Joe likes  Old ladies  Oh what  Oops  I mean  Old ladies  That's two for two  Perfect  No but he's in  He's definitely intense  On the set  I showed up  Unprepared 
[01:34:30]  I don't think  I've ever told this  On the air  Because he changed  The script and stuff  And I'm like  You know what  I'll just go there  And wing it  And I didn't realize  Like this was a real  Fucking thing  Sound guy  Light guy  People you have to  Fucking you know  Fill out forms  And he looks at me  And I'm like  What  I thought we were  Just wing it  So for half of my shoot  We were practicing lines  In the hallway  Until I got it right  Because you guys  Were just thinking  It's like a three minute  YouTube video  Like some of the  Dumb stuff I do  I'm like oh  He's doing one of  My dumb things  But it's his thing 
[01:35:00]  Right  Oh yeah when he was  Yelling at me  He's like  I do stuff  I make things  He looked at me  Like he knew  He couldn't tell me off  I guess  He could have  But I guess  Because of the show  Or whatever  But I could see  You're holding something  A little more important  Than I am  I'll get my husband  To talk to you  I could see in his eyes  He wanted to  Probably fire me  Or tell me off  He called me  But I'm  See it's weird  I'm friends with him 
[01:35:30]  I'm friends with him  You know  When he calls  I go look  I gotta side with my wife  But I said no  I was crying  When I called Rich  To tell him  And he goes  Oh come on  You're an asshole too  I didn't say that  When you were crying  I know  When you were crying  No  Because it was  It's emotional  It was hard  To take someone  Telling you  I mean I didn't know  That everyone thought  I was an asshole  On either shoot  By the way  I mean I  Well the other shoot  The first shoot  You didn't take  My personality was  But Rich  You didn't know  He was the director  What does she act like 
[01:36:00]  On these sets  I'm not on the show  With her  But I know Bonnie  Hold on  Hold on  Is it nervous energy  No Bonnie's a funny person  She's funny anywhere  No no no  I'm just fucking around  So then why  Wouldn't you pick up on that  Because you guys  Have been around forever  It would be like  When I come in here  And I  Sometimes I'll make fun  Of you guys a little bit  Or whatever  Like you're like  Hey you're not  You're disrespecting me  We wouldn't say that  You know  It's like I have to be careful  Sometimes I don't  We wouldn't say that  No you guys wouldn't  But I'm saying  He did  Some people have an issue  With you know 
[01:36:30]  That I don't  I don't give the right amount  Of weight to things  It's a comedian  Respect  No  Bonnie  That's why I'm trying  To jump in here a lot  Because I've seen it  A few times now  He really wants to be  Like a director  Yeah but there's other ways  To be a director  Yeah when we directed  Our movie  There was no way  But he wears different hats  Yeah he's a comic  And you could go at it with him  But when he's doing this stuff  He is focused  But a director can't start  Pouting over pizza toppings  If one of their actors  No because he's intense 
[01:37:00]  And nervous  And wants to make sure  It all works out in the end  He has  To be fair to him  And he has a lot to worry about  He has a lot to worry about  He has to worry about his lines  Because he's acting  And he knows how he wants  The thing done  Because he wrote  The whole fucking thing  He's doing it in a very short  Amount of time  And then he's picking people  He thinks could do the roles  So there's a lot to worry about  And then when I show up  I go  Oh uh  And he looked at me like  You don't know your fucking lines  I got Bill Burr here  And I  Oh he said that  He goes  I've had Opie in my shit  I've had Bill Burr in my shit 
[01:37:30]  Yeah me  Like I'm like  First thing I've done in here  I'm directed  Like these are people  That I've directed  Like he had Pacino  And fucking Dustin  Will somebody pick up the hotline  In the other room  Why who is it  I don't know  It's just ringing  And nobody picks up the phone  It might be  I could just pick up the hotline  But now it's  Now somebody else did  Because you told him to  Somebody's got to  I don't give a fuck  Who it is  Pick him up  But here's the thing  I just want to say about it  Is that  I'm not mad at him 
[01:38:00]  For being mad at me  Yeah  For whatever  At the shoot  I apologize for that  It's  What I am upset with  Is  Don't  If you're a friend of mine  You know  Then A  You should probably know  A little bit about  Who I am  Like as a person  I'm not a person  That comes in  And shakes people's hands  And is completely appropriate  Oh so you are an asshole  Yes  I am an asshole  Yeah  That's what I'm trying to tell you  Why would you be an asshole  It's my sense of humor  I think it's funny  You know  I'm not to your side  With DeRosa  Because it's like 
[01:38:30]  I know that  I know how Bonnie is  Like I know you're just trying to be funny  And like I do stuff  But it's like  Remember Patrice  Was shooting something  And he said  After he shot the project  He goes  Oh my god  I've been an asshole  He goes  Anybody on your set  Who's asking like  Questions  Or being that guy  Is an asshole  Like he felt bad  About the way he had acted  On all those sets  When he was shooting something  So Joe's just a new director  He was probably overreacting  But he was just stressed  Because he's a new director 
[01:39:00]  Right  But my problem  Is how he went about  Then afterwards  Like  Trash  I mean he gave me  A trashing  Well  For 20 minutes  About my character  I mean  But he sets it in a way  Where you realize  Quickly  You gotta take it very seriously  So when you were messing around  With the whole pizza thing  That probably drove him nuts  I didn't know at that time  I honestly was not aware  That I was  Well pizza wasn't in the budget  Yeah  But he's also not  An experienced enough director  Like he's done a few things  To know how to handle that 
[01:39:30]  Like  Whereas when you're dealing  With an actor  Who wants to do a character  Their way  The best way may be to go  Oh let's try a few takes  Your way  And see how it works  But he might not have  Had enough experience  To do that  So he might have just  Panicked a little bit  I did one with him  And it went really well  Yeah he's a nerd  Oh well  You and him  Are fucking lovers  Isn't that wonderful  But mine went well  Also  So maybe Bonnie is  The problem  Well I mean  I saw  I'm not saying  I'm not the problem  That's the whole point  I'm not saying that  I completely  I'm saying that  I could  I really 
[01:40:00]  Believe me  I know from past experience  That I tend to rub people  The wrong way  It happens  You know  And I don't know  That it's happening  A lot of times  Until I'm in too deep  I got enough info  Okay  Joe's a nervous Nelly  He wants everything  To work out  I'm serious  Work out well  He's controlling  You show up on the set  He is really nervous  Because he wants  Everything to work  He wants  He wrote the script  He has the vision  And he wants everyone  To take it seriously  As well  Bonnie  Taking it seriously  But comes across  Like she's not 
[01:40:30]  Yeah like I had  My lines memorized  But he should have  Realized it's just  Bonnie being Bonnie  And that she is  Taking his project  Seriously in the end  But what  He's taking it aside  And said something to you  And said hey look  I'm a little nervous  To eat you know  Right  He should have talked to you  Privately  Instead of having a  Blow up in front of people  Right  Did you ever get the  Peppers and onions  We did  And then I spilled it  On the floor  Oh I thought it was  Just to bring the pizza  Okay  All right guys  I added nothing  Take care  Okay bye bye Jimmy  Bye bye  But why during all of this  Would you look at me 
[01:41:00]  And go sexual tension  Why would you say  Oh thank you though  Just to fuck with your head  Yeah  Why would you do that  You don't fuck with him  When you do that  You fuck with me  Did you see Brian Regan  Rubbing her arm  I don't mind Brian Regan  Why are you doing this  Brian Regan's a big headliner  I noticed that  He has a tour bus  And he was like  You know  If you get rid of him  Wink wink  Are you kidding me  It all went down  I almost gave Brian  Her number  And he was making believe  He was giving Bonnie  A phone number  But he really gave me  A phone number  And he did in such a way  Like look  I'm not kidding  But I gotta make believe 
[01:41:30]  I'm kidding in front of him  That doesn't matter  See I can't  I don't  I think he liked how  Sexual tension bothers you  No I can't control  Other people  I can't control her  I can't control  I've given up  Very healthy attitude  I let go  And I let go  People do what  They want to do  I respect you  And I think that  You are right  On a lot of things  Psychologically  You break stuff down  Very well  But sexual tension  Is not always the case  In every  Guy, girl  How's the fuck with him  Yeah but it doesn't  Because then later  He's yelling at me 
[01:42:00]  Is that real with him?  Yes it's real  Let it go  It's not real  Let's not turn this into me  She's having a fight  With DeRosa  She's telling me  It's real  And you asked me  Why the sexual tension  So somewhere in your head  You think it's real  I'm playing off  What you said  Listen doctor  All I'm saying  Body  That's what I live with man  That's what I live with  Holy fuck  Is it any wonder  I go to places  And act like an asshole  When you asked me  What do you mean  By sexual tension  You meant that  No I'm saying 
[01:42:30]  You said that  Just to fuck with me  He keeps bringing it back  But you meant  Why you think  Sexual tension  In his head  He's like  Did they have sex  And you weren't going for the joke  Or any of that shit  You really were trying to  You know  Pick my brain over  And the only reason I said it  Was to fuck with you  Rich what's up man  Nothing  What's up  You know I got a question  And he does keep bringing it back  To that  You mentioned that  Like at the beginning of the story  And then we move on from that  And Rich brings it back  Listen I know it's your hour  But you shouldn't be talking this much  I would never sleep with DeRosa  I don't like this  Take me seriously Rich  This is my hour 
[01:43:00]  And I see it going a certain way  Don't insult me  Officially it's not your hour  Don't help me stop  You're insulting me too  Officially it's not your hour  I need to be respected  I've decided that I  Can we get a pizza  No buddy  We're not getting pizza  I got a trip to LA  So I gotta waste some time  Oh can I just add one more thing  Yes  Joe was late to the shoot  What his own shoot  Yes  And you're not taking it seriously  And I didn't bring it up  In the phone call or anything  Where's Joe  He doesn't take my hour seriously  He hasn't showed up yet  He's late  He's a chronic 
[01:43:30]  Does he know you guys are here  And he's not gonna show up  I'm friends  What I mean  He called yesterday  And I meant to text him  Thanks  We're all friends  I didn't too  By the way  You were great in that short  I was  Yeah I thought so  You didn't watch it  Did you not watch it out of spite  No no because I thought I was overacting  At that point  When he kept saying  Be angrier  Be angrier  I felt like I was just like  In a silent movie  Walking around  You know  Now everyone's gotta check it out  Just to see  Now that they know  What's going on behind the scenes  He's showing  What's it called 
[01:44:00]  What are you waiting for  What are we waiting for  Warner Sound I think  Yeah Warner Sound  Just a metallic  YouTube channel  Warner Sound  It's one where  They're going to a concert  Not that one  The other one where  They're waiting to go to a concert  It's all his movies  About concerts  It was the theme  For this little  It's a series  Oh okay  I saw him in Norton  I saw him in Norton's one  See but I'm fucking around  I don't mean that  With any malice  And then  I was at the backstage door  For Sheryl Crow  That's what I played  Oh  And then Norton was for 
[01:44:30]  Cat Williams  Cat Williams  That's the one I saw  And then there was one  For Lindsay Buckingham  Metallica  And Ant did one  Phil Collins  Yeah  Okay  Wow he's directed  All those people  I should have probably  Taken it a little more  I should have  That's really his thing  Though man  He wants to do that shit  Bill Burr  I directed  You see how fucking  Great Bill Burr was  In Breaking Bad  In Breaking Bad  He's fucking good in it man  He's gonna have  A fucking career out there  Big time 
[01:45:00]  He doesn't have to  As a comic  I wrote him off  Early on you know  I was like  I remember seeing him  And I'm like  No  This guy's never  Gonna make it  Done  I really was  I really was wrong  She's an asshole right  He's one of my  Favorite comedians  In the world  I know  But I'm just  Going back to the  Asshole  Yeah  Like  I didn't say that  To people  I didn't walk around  To his audience  You might as well  Go home now  This guy  We had a meeting  We had a meeting  With four big NBC executives  And it was so  There was the black lady  The Asian guy 
[01:45:30]  I mean you couldn't  Get more executive  Than this meeting  Benetton  Benetton head  So we're in the meeting  They walk in  We introduce  And they said to Bonnie  Where are you from  And the first thing  She says to him  My mom's pussy  That's good  Not to these people  Oh you gotta read the room  Not to these people  I said it with a British accent  But that's the shit  I would do  That's why I think  It's good  I don't like reading the room  I like just doing my shit  Yeah 
[01:46:00]  And the more uncomfortable  I can make someone  The better  I want the  I didn't stick around  For nothing  I want the Bonnie  Joe DeRosa conflict now  Yeah well  Joe DeRosa is here  Because he wants  To be a director  He's disrespecting you  I want to be a radio show  Most right  And he's respecting  Never gonna happen  Done  You're an asshole  You're never gonna be on my show  Expect a phone call  What about the girl  Why don't you bring the girl  And Guy in at least  I feel bad  Bring in Kelly  Where's Kelly  No I don't want Kelly  You know you insulted her last time  Bring in Kelly  Eric get Kelly in here

[01:47:00]  I was trying to get over there  But I don't think  I'm gonna make it  I'm not sure  If I'm gonna make it or not  You're still on the air though  Yeah Bonnie told some  Whacked out story about you  What did he say  It wasn't  It wasn't  It wasn't good man  What did he say  What's the story  Well Bonnie said that  You're really really hard  To work with  Oh Jesus  Bonnie McFarlane  Yeah  Summing up  Yeah her  Damn  I hear her fucking  Rotten laughs  No that's me  Rich is here  And Bonnie's here 
[01:47:30]  And she told a horrific story  I feel really bad for her  Don't listen to him  Don't  Don't fall for it  It's tough  You know it's funny  That she bring that up  From the air  Because you know  Yesterday I had a call with her  And tried to say  Hey  We haven't talked  In a long time  Oh she's not over it  Hey you think  Somebody called you back  After you leave a message  Like that  I've been really busy  I'm sorry  Joe  Tell him to call the hotline  She told that whole story  And trust me  She's not over it  That's not true  Alright 
[01:48:00]  Well guess what  I'm not over it either  She's hard to work with  Why are you doing this  Hey Joe  Was I easy to work with  I'm pure breeze  You know what  You're a lot of fun  You're all laughs  Thank you  I didn't remember your lines  I wasn't prepared though  You know what  That didn't matter  When somebody's got a good attitude  That's all that counts  What's happening over there Sam  Turn his eyes out  What  Oh hold on 
[01:48:30]  Bonnie's playing the message  That you left her  Okay  Yeah Joe  Can we call you on the hotline  And make this easier  Yeah but I gotta go  In like two minutes  Alright we'll call you right back  We'll call you right back  E-Roc call him right now  His number's 917  Don't do it  What  What happened  What happened  Alright I hung up on Joe  Call him back  Let me hear the message  You left Bonnie  Okay  Hey Bonnie  It's Joe  DeRosa 
[01:49:00]  I know we haven't spoken in a while  Put the bottom to the mic  But I just wanted to call to say  That good luck  This weekend  With the screening  And I'm sure it will  It's a great movie  And I'm really proud of it  It should be  It's really good  And I'm proud to be a part of it  And I just hope everything goes really well  Hey Joe  Yeah  Bonnie just played the voicemail you left 
[01:49:30]  Wait wait you gotta wait till the end  Hold on  We're still listening to it  I miss being friends with you  See  And I told you  And I said to you  That he's reaching out  Okay  Obviously you're my wife  And I'm gonna take your side  But I said he's reaching out  So maybe  Now it's time  To bury the hatchet  And mend waste  In your head  No  I don't care  I don't see it that way  I don't think  I don't think the voicemail was sincere  It was like he was reading  It was kind of like  I think that it's hard for him 
[01:50:00]  It would be hard to say  To say that  You know what  I retract  Hold on a second guys  Hey  Don't believe what  What he's saying to you  First of all  You don't know what I said  So if you're gonna backtrack on it  You know  You should know  What  That I  I fell on the sword  I said I was an asshole  She said she was sorry about  Dripping the peppers on a chair  I didn't hear that part  Yes  I thought you were just saying  That you didn't think  I was being sincere in the message  No no  That's  I don't know if you can tell  The lady voices 
[01:50:30]  From the man voices  But that was OP  It's very confusing  The sirens going out  Listen  The message was very sincere  Yes  I miss  I miss Bonnie  Yawn  Yawn  Sorry  You know  It's the truth  What do you want from me  You know  I feel bad about everything  So you're admitting  You were wrong  Wait we didn't get Joe's side of the story  Joe 
[01:51:00]  So what happened on the set  Because she told her version  Really quickly  Because I know you're going into a meeting  What happened  And be honest  This is what happened  Bonnie did  Bonnie spilled some stuff on the chair  I got upset  Because it was like the head guy  At Warner Brothers chair  And I was like  Bonnie come on man  And she kind of like snapped  At me a little bit  And was like  Whatever  And then she walked out of the room  And didn't help me clean it up  And then I got mad  See  I told her exactly 
[01:51:30]  It's exactly the same story  I gotta take Bonnie's side  I told the exact same story  You're wound a little tight Joe  I'm thinking  How bad could the chair be  With the little pizza on it  It was a fucking velvet chair  Joe  Joe  I just want to go back  A little bit  To when I  I was an asshole  Asking for  Peppers and onions  On half of the pizza  I think you're missing the point  Bonnie  But Bonnie  You didn't do it on purpose  Right  I didn't do it on purpose 
[01:52:00]  Alright Joe  If she didn't do it on purpose  Can't you understand that  A little bit  Of course I can  And I didn't  It's not like I screamed at her  And went  What the fuck  You made her cry  You made her cry  She did cry in the end  Wait a minute  Bonnie cried  Two days later  When we talked  Exactly  She cried  At night  No that night  I didn't really know  That it was like  That bad  Is that Sam  Sam you're really  Bugging me  Well listen  If you would respect  Don't disrespect him  Don't disrespect me  I'm trying to do a show here 
[01:52:30]  It's not your show yet  It is  Yes it is  What the fuck  I gave you a break  And he was  Trying to push me out the door  Go fuck yourself  He was booked to do my show  And he just decided  Not to show up  Yeah  I'm sorry  He was late to his own shoot  Too guys  It's disrespectful  He's not going to get back  On the after show  Joe it seems like  You were wound a little too tight  Joe I just want to go over  One more point  You had a lot on your mind  That day right  Now Opie  Opie let me ask you this  Let me ask you this  And I'm not saying this  To be provocative anyway  You were with me that day 
[01:53:00]  When we shot  Oh no you don't want to ask this  You don't trust me  I don't know  I'm not  I wasn't  Opie would you say  I was wound tight  Yes  Yes  Yes  There's a lot to think about  I'm a little stressed  I said Joe  I did kind of  We all said that  I kind of stuck up for it  I said he absolutely  He's wound a little tight  On the set  And he's definitely  A different Joe DeRosa  But I said I respected that  Because I know  He wants it to go well 
[01:53:30]  Because you wrote it  It's your vision  You got other people there  That you hired  I get it  But no  My answer was  You're wound a little tight  And Bonnie agreed with him  But here's  And then on top of it  You got to act out  Your part of the whole thing too  Here's the thing  Joe  Here's the thing  And Bonnie agreed with that too  That you're stressed out  It's a lot of pressure  But say you hired an actor  Just a regular actor  To lead in one of your shorts  That are great  And that actor  Didn't come prepared  And didn't know their lines  You would fucking lay into them 
[01:54:00]  Like no tomorrow  But being that it's Opie  And he has the Opie and Anthony radio show  You didn't attack  You know  You didn't go after him like that  So what I'm  But hold on  So with Bonnie  You know Bonnie's an ass  From Jump Street  So you should have realized  That's her character  She's just trying to have fun  To play with her  What?  Rich  First of all  Let me  Let me  Swap down your first statement  Because we didn't yell at you  When you didn't know  Any of your fucking lines  On the cheap set 
[01:54:30]  First of all  I didn't have a line  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  First of all  I didn't have a line  First of all  Joe  You had  18 people cancel  Before you got rich  Second of all  I didn't have a line  You told me to ad-lib it  But go ahead  But my point is  Is that  I didn't like  The one thing  I'm joking with you  About the cheap thing  The thing that I can't  Agree with you  You should see Bonnie's face  Because she doesn't look at  She's not looking at it 
[01:55:00]  Like it's a joke  Go ahead  No, no  I'm used to  I'm used to  A more funny  Funny kind of  No, I like talking to Joe  Me and Joe  Talk things out  Go ahead  Let me hear what you say  But Rich  You said  I wouldn't lay into  Anybody  I didn't lay into Bonnie  We got off on the wrong foot  I got mad at something she did  And then I felt like  There was this weird tension  And she was being like  Shitty to me  Two days later  That I didn't  We didn't even talk  But I don't know why  He thought there was  Anything going on  There was no  Not one bit of communication 
[01:55:30]  On my part to say  Hey, you're an asshole  Or whatever  You just sat in your apartment  And stewed  Until you picked up the phone  And said  I have to tell you  I have to get this off my chest  To make me feel better  Bonnie  Yes  Bonnie, that's not  That's not true  What I did was  I sat and tried to wait  Until I was level-headed  Enough to talk to you about it  And unfortunately  It didn't go well  But what I wasn't going to do  Was call a friend  When I was at the height of anger 
[01:56:00]  Well, you shouldn't have  You shouldn't have called at all  I don't agree with that  But wait  No, it is true  Because you know why  Joe, we're not married  We're not fucking  We're not  There's no reason  To have this kind of relationship  Where we have to get along  On every single level  At some point  You have to go  Hey, you did it  Out of selfishness  You did it  Because you wanted  To get it off your chest  And you wanted  To let me know  Rich does it all the time too  It might be a guy thing  Where you need to unload  Don't put me in on this  Bonnie, I don't  Hold on 
[01:56:30]  I gotta say this  Oh, here we go  Stop talking, Bonnie  I'm gonna trash you now  For 20 minutes  No, I don't  Bonnie, I don't agree  What you're saying  And I'm offended by it  I love that  This is exactly  How the conversation went  By the way  Now I can leave, Sam  Now I can leave  Bonnie, Bonnie  Uh-huh  Yeah  Yeah  Honestly, quite frankly  I called you yesterday  To try to smooth things over  Yes  And instead of calling you back  Calling me back like a friend  And talking to me about it  You just go on the radio 
[01:57:00]  And try to make a bit out of it  And then start acting like  You were in no way wrong  In this situation  Joe  That's not what I said  That's not what happened at all  She apologized for the pizza  Joe, I did tell her to take it  A little more seriously  Than she was  I must say  Alright, alright, alright  I did try  Because I'm like  Whoa, you're not taking this seriously  Alright  And Bonnie didn't try  I don't have a problem  Joe, I don't have a problem  With you being mad at me  I don't have a problem  With you telling me  That I was a jackass 
[01:57:30]  What I have a problem with  Is that you felt the need  For some reason  To go over every fucking flaw  That I have  On that phone call  You didn't touch me too, Bonnie  No, I absolutely did not  I couldn't get you  To get off the phone  I begged you to stop  That's not true, Joe  That's not true  Verbatim  Your exact words to me were  Joe, I don't know  What I did to piss you off  So I want you to go through  It and tell me  Exactly what I did  You said that to me  That's ridiculous  I said, alright, Bonnie  If you want me to, I will  And I started with  The stupid pizza thing 
[01:58:00]  And you got really hung up on it  And I was like, Bonnie  It's not about the pizza  And you're like, well  Why are you bringing it up?  And I'm like, because you asked me  To tell you exactly  How he does my voice  Sounds annoying  But wait  But here's the thing  Joe  I asked  I begged him to stop  And then I did say  Are you sure you want to do this?  You went for it  And the other thing is  Is that  I need to know  Did everyone hate me  On the cheat set?  And did everyone hate me  On the  Whatever the other thing  Was called  No, nobody hated you

[02:19:30]  Wouldn't you say  Yeah  I'm doing that too  You can always just leave  You know  Okay it's bye  And you go back to your hotel  You're like are you hungry  I'm hungry  Let's go together  I in Charlotte  The first night  This dude  It's such a gamble  Who they pair you with  This guy went up  Right before he goes up  He comes back to the green room  He meets the guy opening for me  And he doesn't even look at me  He just sort of puts his hand out  Like to give me like a kind of high five  Like a brother  Like a  Hey  He doesn't even look at me  I go  No  No I'm a girl  Hi  No  And you can look at someone 
[02:20:00]  When you meet them  I think he was just nervous  And trying to play it too cool  Right  And then before he leaves the room  You shot that right down  Oh yeah  I'm like no  You turned that into  Now I feel like an asshole  And then I'm like  And before he leaves the room  I'm like  And you have a censor on your shirt  And he goes  Oh I was in a rush  And I'm like  Okay great  You mean like he stole something from the gap  And the censor was still on  The censor was on a shirt  And he was I was in a rush  I'm like that's why you didn't pay for it 
[02:20:30]  What do you mean how does Amy know  She's told the stories  How do you know you're not like a prop guy  He's not a prop guy  I thought maybe it's part of the act  He'll be like  Oh look I got this censor on my shirt  Anyone ever walk out  With a censor on his shirt  Right on my head  I thought maybe he did that  But he did not do that  It was not a part of the act  Wow  It's a gamble  Oh it certainly is  Sometimes yeah  Sometimes  They explode ink when you blow  When you break those  It shoots ink all over it  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh and then you'll see someone  With ink all over their shirt  You know what happens  It's like when you rob a bank 
[02:21:00]  And then the money has an ink thing in it  You know  Right  That's sort of like that  Yeah the dye packet  When I shopped  I watch those shows  I never stole anything  With a censor on it  When I was shopping  No no  When I was stealing  When I was stealing stuff  As a youth  They didn't have any of that shit  No they didn't have any of that shit  They had it when I was doing it  But not  They had  You know what the deterrent was  When I was a kid  Fear  Fear  That was it  You never do any shoplifting  Growing up  Oh fuck yeah  The obligatory candy  Shit like that  But never anything big  And you were petrified 
[02:21:30]  That either your parents  Are going to find out  Or the store owner  Even back then  They didn't call the cops  They fucking whacked you  They threw you out of the place  You couldn't go back in  And that was like  The place that you went  That was like your bar  As a kid was the candy store  The fear is the best part  Fear  The fear is the best part  That's what it was  Not from a mom and pop shop  It's a nice adrenaline rush  It's a cheap adrenaline rush  Shoplifting  Totally  Yeah yeah yeah  You definitely  What have you stolen Tim?  Tom sorry  I don't do it anymore 
[02:22:00]  But no no  I  No I was really  It was just one  One sort of week  I think in high school  Where some kid  I was hanging out with  Who was a bad influence  We would go up to  Dairy Queen every day  At the mall  DQ  For lunch  And you know  And then he'd say  You know  He started  This guy was like  Stealing stuff all the time  And he was sort of like  Like kind of  You know  You know  Peer pressuring me  Into stealing something  So I went into  The department store  And I stole  Like a Pope John Paul spoon 
[02:22:30]  And a Duran Duran cassette  Because it was just like  It was in the back  In sort of a bin somewhere  It was in the safe area  It was a safe area  So I just stole  Some stuff I didn't want  That must have been  The time where the Pope  Was coming around  I don't feel bad about  Because nobody would have  Ever bought that stuff  No  It seems like you feel  A little bad about it  I do feel bad about it  Yeah  I do feel bad about it  I never felt guilty  About stealing anything  Nope  Never  I never stole again  Though since then 
[02:23:00]  Really?  Yeah  Never stolen anything since  Yeah  I used to  I stole out of like  The thrill  And then out of necessity  After  You know  I got old enough  Where I didn't have money  And like  The drive shaft  Went on my truck once  I had a Ford  Pick up truck  And the drive shaft  Fell right out of it  So I didn't have money  To fix it  So I went out that night  With my friends  And we found a truck  That was exactly like mine  And I just went under  With a wrench  You hooligan  Took the drive shaft  And all I could think of  And it wasn't a guilt thing 
[02:23:30]  It was him starting the truck  Up in the morning  Putting in a gear  Stepping on the gas  And just hearing  And going nowhere  And wondering  And it probably took him so long  Because the first thing you think  Is not  My drive shaft must be missing  Was stolen  You think like  There's a problem with it  So  But it made me laugh  More than feel bad at all  I wasn't like  Oh the poor guy  I was like  I'd love to fucking see his face  What an asshole  Let me clarify my story  Just real quickly  Because I'm feeling a little bit  Of guilt right now  For telling the story  And I'm realizing  Actually it wasn't a 
[02:24:00]  Duran Duran cassette  I just said that  To make the story easier  To understand quickly  On the radio  It was Arcadia  Remember Arcadia  Had the Duran Duran offshoot  Where John Taylor  Yeah John Taylor  And Simon LeBan or something  Went off and did a side project  So it was in a bargain bin  And I figured no one  Was ever going to buy  That cassette  And then the spoon  It was known  Whatever  It was a spoon  That had Pope John Paul II  On it right  So I just figured  No one would buy it anyway 
[02:24:30]  So it didn't really feel like  Sealing because no one  Was ever going to buy it anyway  It was Arcadia  It was not Duran Duran  That's all I'm saying  It was Arcadia  Tom Green's got the guilt  Just to clarify  I don't know  Arcadia had its time  Just want to clarify  It was Arcadia  People love  They love religion  And they love spoons  I don't know  That you're right  About nobody else  Wanting it  Well I feel bad  Maybe I should go back  To that department store  Except they turned it  Into an indoor go-kart track  Years later  They turned the department store  Into an indoor go-kart track  So you're onto something 
[02:25:00]  I'd probably put them  Out of business  So when did you steal  A go-kart  Yeah  Do you have a thief  That would be the funniest thing  To try and steal  That would be really fun  Oh man  Can you even get him out of there  That would be great  Just down the street  Maybe  I love those things  Who doesn't love a good go-kart track  Oh yeah  Isn't that fun  This is ONA's worst of 2012  Continuing on with Tom Green  For the worst of 2012  And the Opie and Anthony show  In this segment here  We get Tom's mom on the phone  To talk to us  About some of the things  That Tom did  During his years  Of the Tom Green show  Both up in Canada 
[02:25:30]  And on MTV  And maybe some of the things  That were so bad  That she wouldn't give Tom  Permission to air  And so we talked to him  About that  And also  What about the jackass guys  That stole all his material  Well we're going to explore that  Right now with Tom Green  And Tom Green's mom  I still have the hood  Of the Slutmobile  Hanging in my  In the wall in my garage  But that's it right there  In the video right there  That's the Slutmobile  But yeah  I told my mom  We might call  This morning  Well we could do that  I mentioned  I thought it might be fun  To call and see how she's doing 
[02:26:00]  They live on a lake  Oh really  They live on a lake in Canada  And they just kind of  Are retired  And they golf  And don't really do much  Really  I think they really  Retirement sounds awful  Trying to encourage them  To get out there  And get a job  All right  Retirement seems to smell weird  I just always picture it  Smelling like milk  Old milk or no?  Old  Oh okay  Because fresh would be great  Fresh milk  Well that's the beginning  Of retirement 
[02:26:30]  And then a couple weeks in  I'm just  More like soy milk  Or whole milk  You start the whole milk  Or what  What are we talking  Fat free  Fat  The real stuff  Yeah the real  Just nice solid whole milk  What's your mom's name?  Mary Jane  Mary Jane Green  Yo Mary Jane  Mary Jane Green  I know what a name  I'm weed all over  What's up Mary Jane?  We got your son in studio  This is Opie  We got Tom Papa  And the great Ron Bennington  Oh hi everybody  Were you listening to the show today?  I was 
[02:27:00]  And then  Our connections in the car  And then  My husband took off with it  To go golfing  So I  I've listened  Till about  15 minutes ago  Wait what do you mean?  You were listening in the car?  Yeah  With my coffee  Really?  Yeah really  Wait what  How's it in the car?  On the  On the  On the radio in the car  But we don't have it in the car  Oh I see  We have it when we drive  Ah  So she's got satellite radio  You've got the satellite radio  But in the car  You've got to sit in the driveway  So you're not listening to it on the internet 
[02:27:30]  You're listening to it in the car  That's neat to think of you out there  Oh can I listen to it on the internet?  No I guess not probably  I don't know  What's the internet?  I just assumed you were listening to it on the internet  But  Where do they  I just did  I didn't  I wasn't visualizing you sitting out in the car  With your coffee  In the woods  That makes  His first appearance on the radio  Yeah that's a good mom right there  That almost makes me feel kind of bad mom  That you would go  But that's a good mom  Supporting you  No thank you mom  You're welcome  For listening in the car  My mom  My mom's talking to a wall somewhere Tom 
[02:28:00]  So you should appreciate this  You really should appreciate it  What area do they live in  That your dad's golfing?  They're in Quebec  Just outside of the city of Ottawa  In the province of Quebec  French part of Canada  Beautiful  In the woods  There's bears  Yeah jeez  There's moose  On a lake  It's lovely  Seen any bears lately?  No actually we haven't  But they're out there  Are there mooses?  Lots of deer  Lots of deer  Not a lot of moose in our area 
[02:28:30]  I don't think deer and moose like to live together  People often ask me if you guys are angry at me still  Because of all the shenanigans  No it's ancient history talk  See everything's fine right?  Everything's cool  Yeah  Well isn't that why they got a house on a lake somewhere?  No no  Did they make their own money?  They bought the house yeah  And we didn't leave a forwarding address  What was the one Tom Green stunt  That really drove you nuts 
[02:29:00]  Out of all of them?  Maybe when he painted my car  Oh the Slutmobile?  No there's actually ones that you  You actually are more angry about than that one mom  You're just not saying it  Because you don't want to say it on the radio  Absolutely Tom  Wow really?  Oh really?  There are some that she is very very angry about  Worse than the Slutmobile  Worse than the Slutmobile yeah  It could have been worse  Mother?  Well you know Tom  Well you know Tom  There are certain segments that we did 
[02:29:30]  That to this day  She is very angry about  To this day?  She doesn't like to talk about them  And I wasn't actually planning on doing this  But it sort of seems kind of funny right now  Because I can tell that you're a little bit  Ho ho ho  Wait you guys actually don't talk about this do you?  Well I mean you know  There was just certain bits  That she did get angrier about  It was really  Why were you so angry about certain bits though 
[02:30:00]  At the end of the day?  Well they were somewhat disrespectful  Disrespectful yeah  Oh boy  And that's why we don't talk about them  You guys really don't talk about them  Yeah but you got to go on Oprah  Yes we did  Got to meet Oprah  Because of you?  Yeah  Because of your son?  Yeah  Yes that's true  She sent you to Tahiti  She did  And that's why you signed the release form  That allowed me to air the bit that you didn't like  Yeah I hadn't really made that connection 
[02:30:30]  Wait she would have lost  Well because after this one particular bit  Which I won't talk about specifics  But anybody who remembers the bit  Will remember that when we aired the bit  Dad  I just moved to New York  And to do the show just started  And we went back to Ottawa  And we filmed this particular bit  That you're angry about  And  Dad called MTV  And left a message  And said that  If we aired that bit  He was going to sue you bastards  For one million dollars 
[02:31:00]  So  I'm sure Viacom was pretty  Concerned about that million dollar  I'm sure they were very scared  So I had  We weren't allowed to air the bit  Because you were going to sue us bastards  For one million dollars  Right?  Right, right  And then that was  That was when everything was kind of  Popping with the show  And  It was very exciting  And Oprah  Invited  My parents and I  To go on 
[02:31:30]  On Oprah  And play the slut mobile  And some of the other  Sort of tamer  Tamer bits  That had already aired  Because  It was for their Mother's Day special  And Oprah wanted me to come on  And apologize  To my parents  And I'd been living in America  For like  Three weeks at this point  Or something  So it was all very odd  And crazy  So we go  Down to Oprah  And I had the release form  In my back pocket  Knowing that maybe  The Oprah  Energy  Might soften you down 
[02:32:00]  And you'd sign the release form  And we could air the bit  And  It worked  It worked  But then what really happened was  Wait, but she didn't know what she was signing  I would assume  No, no  What happened was  On the show  On Oprah  Oprah  Sent my parents  You know how she always surprises people  And gives people cars  And stuff  Right  This was I think  The first  She sent my parents to Tahiti  She said you guys  On Oprah  Oprah said  I'm to apologize  I'm sending you guys  On a 16 day cruise  To Tahiti  Right  You had fun in Tahiti 
[02:32:30]  Right  We did have fun  Yes, we did  Thank you, Oprah  And then after we went out  And had dinner  And you had the knowledge  Of this Tahiti trip  And I asked you to sign  The release form  Because Oprah thought  The pranks on the parents  Were funny  And you signed it  And went to Tahiti  Yes, we did  Which  And it was worth it  Right  For that bit  Yeah, because we were  Kind of worried  That if we didn't  You might end up  Back in the basement  At home  Yeah  Yeah  Living  Can I make a guess  Of which  Which one it was  Mom, can we guess 
[02:33:00]  Well, Tom, you know  You can  I know, I'm not going to guess  Did it have to do  With a statue  Yeah  That was the one  That was the one  That was a funny one  The domestic abuse statue  That was the deal breaker  Right there  The domestic abuse  And that's a little worse  Than the slipmobile  Yeah  This is great  A little too close to the truth  Is that what happened there  Suddenly now  That was the one  Yeah  Does she not like  Your description of it  Now let's ask Mary Jane  Why did that one bother you  Knowing that most people 
[02:33:30]  Would know  It's some kind of  Goofy joke from your son  Well, you know  I don't know  That people do know  That things are  I mean people  Kind of got mixed up  Between truth  And fiction  I think  Yeah  Yeah  There's a lot of lines  Blurred there  And you guys really  Just don't talk about this one  Well, no  We'll talk about it privately  But not on the radio  Right  But I just figured  That would be kind of  A fun thing to throw out there  Just a little  Just to kind of 
[02:34:00]  Throw at you  But you guys got past this  Mary Jane  Can you tell  The other one  The one that I was  The most surprised  That you were really  Angry at me about  Was  And was the first one  That you got really angry about  Was when I showed up  And we used to wake  My parents up  At three o'clock  In the morning  All the time  I remember  They would  Very funny by the way  Mary Jane  More realistic  Authentic reactions  In the middle of the night  But when I brought  The decapitated cow's head 
[02:34:30]  And put it in your bed  That's so gross  That one you were  Very very angry about  Yeah I thought  I was going to throw up  I didn't see what  The big deal was  About that one  I thought it was  Kind of  I thought you would  Have been impressed  With the sort of  Creativity of it  How did you find  That cow head  Or whatever  You were really angry  About that one  Yes well  Very creative Tom  But  Your mom sounds  Really sweet  Yeah  She's trying to  Does she make a good pie  Does she make good pies  There's the cow head 
[02:35:00]  There on the video  Yeah  There's the cow head  I'm putting the decapitated cow's head  In your bed  And you know Tom  When you wake someone up  In the middle of the night  It's you know  You're not thinking  Oh wow  How creative someone is  You're thinking  No but it was the next day  That you were really  You didn't talk to me  For three days  You were angry  I was surprised  That it really  Sort of stuck with you  For that long  Did you like it any better  When Ben Margera  Did the same bits  A few years later  Or did that  Help at all  Same 
[02:35:30]  What do you think  Mom  What do you think  Of that  I think you guys  Were much funnier  Than Ben Margera's parents  Oh wait  I thought that  Wasn't done before  Well  Did you always  Did you always know  That you had a  Zeppelin  Mary Jane  Did you always know  You had a weirdo  In the house  Or what  Well  There were a few of them  The dog  Dad 
[02:36:00]  Yeah dad's a weirdo  They're all pretty weird  Do you have siblings  Tom Green  Yeah younger brother Joe  Yeah  Was he in on  Some of this stuff  Not so much  He just sort of  Observed  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  We're watching  We're watching the video now  On my new YouTube channel  Mom  What's YouTube  Oh really  It's on  Yeah  On the new YouTube channel  YouTube slash Tom Green  You can subscribe  And watch  Me putting the decapitated cow's head 
[02:36:30]  In your bed  Here  What happened  You have to sit in the driveway for it  Yeah  What happened to the comforter  Mary Jane  I think Monica Lewinsky took it  That's right  Oh the famous Monica Lewinsky episode  I forgot about that  That was the last bit actually  That I did with my parents  Because I realized they were becoming jaded  To these surprises  When they didn't even know we were in town  And we walked into their bedroom  At 3 o'clock in the morning  With Monica Lewinsky  And you had her on your show 
[02:37:00]  When she was fucking mess  Yeah  Yeah  I forgot about that  She was dating one of the writers on my show  I believe they were dating  Or something like that  And so she agreed to come up to Ottawa with us  And we had the media sort of on a wild goose chase  Chasing us around  Because we were going to make an announcement  Right  The announcement was that  You know she was starting a handbag company  So we were there looking for fabric  That was  We had a stupid announcement  But we had  Literally the international media came out  It was fun 
[02:37:30]  They thought you were getting engaged  Yeah  We were sort of psyching them out  To think that we were getting engaged  So  But  But yeah  When we walked into your bedroom  At 4 o'clock in the morning  And dad leaned up  And he just looked at us  And he said  Oh hey Monica  How you doing  Wasn't surprised  Nothing  Was he hoping for something  Yeah  I don't know  Mom  I don't know  I hope not  You field that question  You field that one  Well we love your son there Mary Jane 
[02:38:00]  Oh well thank you  Thank you  Thanks mom  Thanks for listening mom  Okay have fun in New York  Alright bye  Okay  Bye  Bye  The worst is yet to come  Dollar Shots coming out everybody  Dollar Shots  Yeah  I need to know  This is ONA's worst of 2012  On the OPN Anthony channel  Yeah  Woo  First year moments  For the past 12 months  OPN Anthony's worst of 2012  Continues 
[02:38:30]  Worst of 2012  OPN Anthony show  My name is E-Rock  E-Rock radio on Twitter  You know the year 2012  Was not really that kind  To Penn State University  Their football program  Has been shot to shit  They've lost all credibility  Because one of their  Assistant coaches  For a long long time  Was molesting  Boys  Well  What happens here  Well the head coach  Doesn't say anything  The people above the head coach  Doesn't say anything  As far as the schools involved  It becomes a whole big scandal 
[02:39:00]  And this school  Looks like total shit  So we've been talking  About that for a while  But in this particular segment  It ties into  Jimmy not liking  Marching bands  And college stuff like that  Tying it in with Penn State  You know there's  Molestation humor  Somewhere in this  Penn State school song  With Jimmy Norton  Right now  This is Opie Anthony's  Worst of 2012  You know when I tell people  I went to Geneseo State University  They go  Whoa  Wow that's a really tough 
[02:39:30]  School to get into  No one said that  Have they  It's  It's  They call it the Ivy League  Of the SUNY system  All this shit  But my point is this  When I did  Went  Did go there  Yeah  It was a shitty  Drinking school  Yeah  See I luck  See I luck out now  You look like  The hero  Yeah I look like  I'm a fucking  You know  Scholar  Scholar  A scholar  But as far as  The Penn State shit goes  You had this nice  University  And guess what  It's tainted  Now it's tainted  You lose  I win  And that's what you get  For associating yourself 
[02:40:00]  With a college  Like this guy  Right  You're so married  To where you went  Who gives a fuck  Yeah who gives a fuck  Oh  And by the way  I'm not married  To you know  That I went to Geneseo  Whatever  It is what it is  You know  I love that  Go home team  Referee whistle  The school song  We here have blue 
[02:40:30]  And a Penn State  There it is  Yes ladies and gentlemen  Here we are  At Penn State University  Here comes the football team  Out on the field  Give them a big cheer  There's Jerry Sandusky  Pucking a young boy  In the ass in the shower  Look at the blood  Running down his thighs  And there's Joe Paterno  Holding his sheet up  In front of him  Going nothing to see here folks  Why is he wearing  Horse blinders  But don't take down 
[02:41:00]  The statue  Should be a big day  For football today folks  Oh boy  Yeah the pride thing  Oh stop it  Yeah I hate  I fucking hate  Alma maters  Like the fact that  You got to go back  To where you went  How about all  Your fathers  Oh fucking  How do I get  Any work done  In this fucking  Cookie house  But that's because  You didn't go to college  Though  I kind of like it  I don't obsess about it  But it's kind of cool  I didn't go to college  But  No I  Because I don't know  If you could relate to it 
[02:41:30]  As long as I'm saying  I'm not taking a shot  No I know you're not  You just come from  A different place  You might be right  As far as this goes  School of hard knocks  I have no allegiance  To a college  So if I went  Maybe I would feel like  Yeah no I get that connection  Because for a lot of people  It's a huge coming of age  Like it means more  Than I'm giving it credit for  Yeah  But I hate the obsession  People have with it  Like the guys  That have to be involved  With everything the school does  And they  You know  They want to say  And what the school is  It's like  Well  Just get on with your life  Those are the creepy people  Yeah  Yeah  You go back to some of these things 
[02:42:00]  And you see the  The 60 year old  With the  The fraternity shirt on  You're like  Huh  Okay  It's a little  Like I'm too old  To go back  I hate that  And what the school song  Is always  We're the Nittany Lions  And we will always be true  Whatever the dumb song is  Whatever the dumb songs are  It's about pride  And how you  Never forget 
[02:42:30]  Yeah  Because if you come to Panstead  You're going to lose the game  You  Shut up  Really  Yeah  Well treat your hiney  Like a pin cushion  If you're a little fella  And now since the sanctions  It is kickoff  And he's running the wrong way  He doesn't even know  How to play the game  What a team they have now  This year  I feel bad  I mean  Your university  Is extremely tainted  They should change the name  Of the place 
[02:43:00]  At this point  It's bad  It's going to be bad  For a long time  And then this asshole  Comparing it to 9-11  9-11  Or 9-11 today  You know  I just saw planes  Crashing into towers  Sally Price feels the same  She says  What hurts most  Is the fact that  The NCAA  Took away 14 years  Of football victories  Under Joe Paterno  It had nothing to do  With the Sandusky scandal  They played hard  They worked hard  For those victories  And to take them away  We will always feel 
[02:43:30]  That he is the NCAA  Victory leader  It's like  It's like the Titanic  And the Hindenburg  All wrapped into one  Oh my god  It's like that school  That the Chechnians  Fucking blew up  With the children in it  Oh my goodness  This reminds me  Of the Nazis  Going house to house  And they're  Weeding out victories  Right now  The NCAA  Is having a cold  Glass of milk  While they shoot  Joe Paterno's victories  Underneath the house  This is the same thing  Six million points 
[02:44:00]  Wiped out  And we're going to  Hunt down the people  The boys  Whose little heinies  Are responsible for this  This is absolutely  Football's version  Of Hiroshima  I feel that the team  You could literally  See the team members  Images burnt into the field  Where they were  Just incinerated  It's  Yeah  Fuck this  Fucking overdramatic  Bullshit  The bottom line is  They wiped out  All those victories  Think about it  What does it mean 
[02:44:30]  You just don't feel  Like a winner anymore  No  It means  Nothing  And again  Ope said it yesterday  That's because  That would have  Affected people's decision  Yeah  To go to that school  And the NCAA  Was saying  You know what  Here's your wins  They're gone  It makes complete sense now  Yes  Because if Paterno  Talk back in the day  Yeah  Potential recruits  Would have went somewhere else  And all that shit  He was a twat  Who cared more  About his own legacy  And football  Than he did 
[02:45:00]  Fucking kids  Getting fucked in the ass  It's just  Mind boggling  How that whole  Fucking university  Like the upper echelon  People  Behave like just  Pigs  I guess  I guess when you're  From Factoryville  Pennsylvania  It's a big thing  I get that  To have  Penn State  Fight on state  Fight on state  Strike your gate  And win  Victory we predict  For thee  We're ever true to you

[02:46:30]  Could it's a reflection  On us  Here in Ziltsville  Yes  Ah  Yeah  Points  We will gain  While blood  Runs down  The drain  And the boy's  Heine  Is in pain  What the fuck  Are we  Insane  Go team 
[02:47:00]  Go  Make the young  Boys blow  Watch Sandusky's  Erection  Grow  As he removes  That youthful glow  Fucking delusional  Idiots  Oh Tyson's on  Do they need to say  Former professional boxer  Who Mike Tyson is  Does anybody not know  Who he is 
[02:47:30]  I don't know  Who he is  Here's a guy  Not happy with this  Oh no  That's this dumb  And blind guy  Sure is  Joe Paterno  Jesus  Tim in Pennsylvania  What's up Tim  Hey guys  So I understand  The whole  Reasoning behind  Bashing Sandusky  I went to Penn State  For four years  Graduated last year  Of course  Yeah the university  Is now tainted  That's gotta suck  Yes sir  But  Taint  You know it does suck a bit  But the thing that sucks more  Is the grouping  And the basic 
[02:48:00]  Bashing you guys are doing  To the university  As a whole now  I didn't have any hand  In that  But  Hand  We're not bashing the students  To just interrupt you  We're not bashing  The student body  The athletes  But it wasn't just  Sandusky  It was the head coach  Who kind of represented  The university  Who was beloved  And it was also  The president  It was like  All these higher  Head of Penn State  It was a lot more  Than just one guy dude  Right  Right  But what's bullshit  Is there's people like you  Huh  I understand  I understand  That means you don't understand 
[02:48:30]  So why don't you just say  What you need to say  Can I explain  You go ahead  Explain sir  Yes  Thank you  Yes go ahead  Explain  Spock explain  So from the top  There were definitely some issues  But when media outlets  Like yourself  See that's the downplaying it  Some issues  Some little issues  Yeah they did kind of  Dude they ignored  Major issues  Child fucking  A lot of major issues  Not just some issues  I'm not done explaining  Oh  But in a way  We don't like your semantics  When you said  When you said there are some issues  Up at the top  Like you just pushed that aside  Right there  That's not accurate  It's like the mayor of Amity 
[02:49:00]  Some bathers were injured  Right  Exactly  Those boys assholes  Look like the Kinder boys  It's called downplaying it sir  Yeah  I was kind of being  I was kind of being sarcastic  But I'm sorry  There were a lot of issues  Okay  Alright we'd like that  The point I'm trying to get at  Is media outlets  Like yourselves  Pulling these clips  From fucking the loonies  Saying about how  Basically the whole  Sandusky issue  Was our 9-11  He doesn't speak for me

[02:56:30]  I'm trying to get that art down  Can't get any wider than me man  I'm so glad  Who Kid's the American dream  Right there  Hell yeah  Non-threatening  Holy shit  What the hell  Mike Tyson  You got a play going on  Yes I do  I'm 48th and Broadway  The Longacre Theater  And um  What's this about  I saw it last night  And I can tell you  It's fucking awesome  It's about me  Awesome  Wait you went last night  I went last night  And I saw it  Nice  It's hilarious  Right  And it's  It's not meant to be hilarious  This is not no fun  I'm not no damn stand up 
[02:57:00]  But I'm just explaining  Some shit I went through  Right  You know  And life is funny  But to us laymen  That's pretty funny shit  Like some of the stuff  You went  Of course it was probably  Painful at the time  Some of it  Oh at the time  I wanted to commit suicide  Motherfucker  You know  I'll tell you why it was funny  Because the way you explained it  And the way you went through it  Was so natural  I felt like  This is what it sounds like  If you're hanging out with Mike Tyson  And he's telling you these stories  It didn't feel performed or forced  It felt very genuine  Very natural  It was very very honest 
[02:57:30]  Great man  Well that's why it's undisputed  It had to be true  You know  Because there's people out there  That know the truth  And if it's not true  They're going to come up  And say hey  I was dead motherfucker  It was so cool  To be able to say this to you  I know right  I'm doing something wrong  He was made for this show  I know right  Jesus was made for this show  Whose idea  Whose idea was this  To come up with the play  Well me and my wife  We went to witness  Chaz Palminteri  Amazing right  And man we watched this stuff  I'm like oh 
[02:58:00]  And just like my show  With different emotions  And stuff  And I said I can do this  Because this is basically  What I do when I'm in Europe  And Asia  You go up there  But not as detailed  As Chaz was  You know I go up there  And they talk about you  I talk about my life  And you know this happened  But normally when I did this stuff  I'm always high  I was going to do my high season  You know what I mean  It was my high season  So I'm always high  Sweating like a pimp  With one hoe up there  I'm just sweating  Like buckets of water  And so  Now I'm clean  So I'm telling my wife 
[02:58:30]  Hey baby  I can do this  And stuff  And my wife  Is the entrepreneur  Business person  Okay let's do it  So we meet this guy  Adam Stuck  That does  You know  Men Down Under  And all the hunks  From you know  From Australia  And human nature  So he said  Let's make a show  And then we did the show  In Vegas for a week  It was a soul out crowd  For a week  And then Spike Lee  Got in touch with us  And wanted to do  What the New Land  Is on Broadway  And I said wow  We're getting ready  To go on a world tour  And little basements  And stuff  And they said yes  You really do  And then it's Broadway  And I'm just very grateful  And that's what I'm trying 
[02:59:00]  To convey  Like a lot of gratitude  And I'm just really grateful  I can't wait to see this show  I didn't know you were going last time  I only got one ticket  They had one ticket  And I went  And it was fucking so good  Because the stuff  Like I saw the documentary  That James Toback did right  Which was amazing by the way  And it didn't feel  Like a retread of that  It was like  Everything had a different angle  Than that  So I didn't feel like  Well I saw this already  It was amazingly different  But I explained  During my  Not to mention  But the introduction  That I know you saw  James Toback 
[02:59:30]  But I was in rehab  And I was really dark stuff  Because I'm hot  I still got dope in my system  And I'm just going to let you  Full speed ahead  It's going to be a lot lighter tonight  You know  And it was  But it felt very honest  None of it  You didn't once feel like  Hey there's a guy  Giving me a performance  That's why I loved it  It's like this is what  It feels like  To hear you tell these stories  For real  But they got to hurry up  Because the last show was Sunday  So you better hurry the fuck up  Let me tell them where it is  Why such a short run  Donald Trump came  50 Cent came  A lot of people  Jim Norton came 
[03:00:00]  Jimmy  He's a biggie  Jim Norton  Ain't Norton  Ain't Norton  I did a Norton impersonating too  I did some Ralph Crampton stuff  Oh yeah you did do a good Crampton line  Yeah I did some Ralph  Oh it's coming at you buddy  It's coming  We met years ago  You don't remember  I was hosting the porno awards  And you were on the  The  I'm not like that anymore guys  No it's okay  He just gave you some  It was a long time ago  It's many years ago  I was really big in the porn world  Back then  A long time ago 
[03:00:30]  A long time ago  A long time ago  A long time ago  A real social event  Mike  Mike do you consider yourself  Like the same person you are now  Like the sense of humor  And the gratitude and appreciation  For what you have  And what people do with you  And for you  As you were back then  Or are you  It's funny you say that  Hilarious  No  No it's not really funny  You say  Back then  I took myself too serious  Yeah  I thought you can't make fun of yourself  If you're going to be the world conqueror  Genghis Kong didn't make jokes around him  And stuff  So I didn't understand 
[03:01:00]  I just didn't understand  Art of fighting  I just didn't understand  This is how you get this accomplished  Right  You know  And I would have  Oh man I wish I was that way  Well I ask that  Because there is such a distinction  Between that Mike Tyson  And who we've grown to know  At least through  You know  Your performances  And movies  And interviews  Now  It seems like a very different person  You seem a lot happier  And in a better place now  Well I'm not as desperate  As I was back then  For glory  As I am  But isn't that part of being  A great boxer 
[03:01:30]  Is you  You kind of have to have  That desperation for glory  Well it's part of becoming  A great  Anything  Anything yeah  But not  Great doesn't necessarily mean good  You know  So you get in a lot of troubles  Because I know a lot of great people  But not all of them are good people  Right  Yeah yeah  So I'm trying to  I'm trying to  Interact with that stuff  You know  I'd rather be remembered  To being good  Because you're only a person  For a small income at a time  Right  You know  You're an athlete  Or entertainer  You know  Small  So you're going to be a person  Longer than yoga  You're going to be an entertainer  So you want to be 
[03:02:00]  Pretty much a decent person  I don't even know  If you can grasp  How big of a change  It is  In people's perception  Of you over the years  Because  And how you actually  Pulled it off  In these days  Now being  Who you are  Because there was a perception  Of you that  You couldn't even  Like if you were sitting  In this room  Years ago  We'd be fucking petrified  Yeah  Me too  Me too  I remember the repercussion  I was like  God  Now what's going to happen  Fuck  I'm going to go  In the front for this one 
[03:02:30]  Shit  I'm going to go  In the front for this shit  God damn  You did what  Mike  Was it  Was it  A thought out  Kind of a  Reintroduction  Of who you are  Or was it  A natural progression  No  I wanted to live  You know  I wasn't going anywhere  Nice  I was really dark  I was really bad  It goes  It comes  No listen  This is me  Big time  Entertainment  Mike Tyson  This big top guy  Big  Youngest champ  Of the world  And I'm 
[03:03:00]  I'm down to telling  The dope man  Well you tell your boss  To come see me  About this  Oh shit  I'm going from that  I'm going from that  No no no  Of course this  Mike  My boss wants this  Well you tell your boss  To come see me  About this  Wow  It goes from that  Fuck  Yeah yeah  There's a great part too  I love  I love the  Mitch Green  It's fucking  Great  It's hilarious  It's fucking  Because I didn't know  All the facts  You don't have no idea  That a guy like Mitch Green exists 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  I have no idea  You have no idea  You see people do this on television  But you don't see people do this  Well you don't have nobody  In your family  Well you know Mitch Green  You don't fit  You know Mitch  You're from the same  He represents y'all  Queen  Can you explain  The Mitch Green thing  Well it's a very famous story  I mean they fought  Of course Mike beat him  And then there was a fight  In a place called  What Dapper Dan's  In Harlem  And it was a big story  Because Mike really  Fucked up Mitch's eye 
[03:04:00]  And nose  But he goes through  The whole story  From your point of view  Because I don't know  These are some different  Kind of niggas  I think  I'm thinking Tom Buston  Some tough ass guy  I got walked  And so all of a sudden  I'm getting here  All of a sudden  I feel the energy good  And I feel the energy  Stop dead  But my back is turned to him  I turn around  It's Mitch Green  They scared as a motherfucker  So I'm not scared  Because I just kicked Mitch's ass  Why should I be scared  So I'm trying to figure out  Why these guys are scared  And then Mitch thought that shit again  Right  So I'm like man  I don't want to hear this shit 
[03:04:30]  Mitch  And I'm around  I'm looking at the successful  Jewish guys  I got Jewish managers  And so  I'm putting some Jewish  Langistic skills  With my ghetto stuff  Right  My motto  Right  And it's like this  And I'm like Mitch  And I go like that  I said  Well Mitch  You really need to  This is my  Mitch you really need to  Stop this  Because this is not  Going to be advantageous  To your barometer  You know  And you know  And then  And then  And then  I go like that  Mitch  Because I already 
[03:05:00]  Kicked your ass  Mitch  All right  So don't start  No shit  I beat your ass  Mitch  And then once  I said that  Forget it  Nigga  You ain't beating me  Don't even give me  My badim  I couldn't eat  Motherfucker  I'm going to beat you  Grown man  I ain't eat  Motherfucker  Fuck you  Nigga  Why did I say that  I shouldn't even say that  I'm thinking I'm learning  Some stuff  From some white people  I'm being articulate  And people don't respect  My skills  In Harlem  I'm thinking people  Are respecting  AD  I'm thinking some black  People are respecting  That shit  Once I said that  He lost it  Holy shit  Nigga  You bitch ass 
[03:05:30]  Fissiland Tyson  Fuck  Wow  Must have fucked him up  He wouldn't stand out  He wouldn't stand out  I shouldn't have  I shouldn't have said  That  Once I said  You mentioned  Stop  I already beat your ass  I'm not going to be  Gaventatious  If I fucking lay you out  Here  Right  My brother  Respectable  I shouldn't have used  Nigga  And laid you out  But anything else  Was cool  It could have been  Handled in  You know  In congress  I could have said  Without those words  Hilarious  Classic man  Holy shit  He's a scary guy 
[03:06:00]  Mitch Green  Because he fucking  Seems crazy man  No because he's 6'5  Right  And he had big hair  Because 80  They had big hair  Like you know  New Jersey people  They had big hair  Back then  Jersey people  Back then you know  The big hair  In Jersey  In the 80s  And stuff  Billy  Piano man  Billy Joe  He's the baddest man  In the 80s  Jersey people  But listen right  But um  He had big hair  So really  He's like 6'12  7 foot  You know  No he's really big 
[03:06:30]  Yeah  And he's a fucking guy  That just  Even though Mike  Is a beat him  He wouldn't stop  This guy got a hole  In his head  And he's still  Looking for me  Wow  God no  I saw him  Not long ago  And he came  I said  Oh no  And he won some money  I gave him  Take all this shit  Alright  Take this shit  Mitch  Don't talk to me  Go  Go  I want to see this show  It's fucking  So good  Why is it ending 
[03:07:00]  I got other jobs  Mike's busy  They should make it  Into a movie  Or something  Maybe  You know  God willing  I'm just very grateful  What's happened  Last year  The year before  Thank God  Didn't make things  Happen this year  You know  I'm just happy  What happened last year  And the years before  That put me in a position  To be here  You know  Just all about being grateful  You know  Because um  Man I was almost  Out of here  You know  My last case  Man  If I got convicted  Man  I would have been gone  I got like 20 felons  Man  I'm the only guy  I got more felons  Than anybody 
[03:07:30]  That's out on the street  Ain't nobody on the street  With more felons than me  That's on the streets  No I'm very grateful  No that's real talk  Ain't nobody on the street  With more felons  Than me walking the streets  So I'm very grateful  Do you have any regrets  About uh  Not having as many years  In boxing  During your prime  That you could have  If you weren't  In so much trouble  Um  I don't know  I don't know  Maybe everything  Happens for a reason  I was pretty  I was getting pretty dark  In that moment  During 91 and stuff  I was getting pretty dark  And going to prison  Was probably the best thing  That happened to me 
[03:08:00]  You know  I was out there  Sleeping with strangers  Unprotected  I could have been  In the AIDS program  Yeah yeah yeah  And I'm not saying  That means  I'm just very um  I'm very grateful  And very lucky in life  You know  Yeah  Very lucky  What was the song  I wanted to ask you  What was  There was a song  There was a great montage  Scene of you  With this black and white footage  And it looked like  It was sped up  You were punching so fast  And there was great music  Playing over  Do you know what  The song  What they used for that was  Hey um  Let me explain  Something to you  It's not  Speed it up  Oh no I know  Don't make a demonstration 
[03:08:30]  I was complimenting you  I knew it wasn't  I wasn't implying it was  That's what I'm saying  How fast you punched  That was almost  That was almost  My fucking jaw  Coming off  It's just that  I was so extreme  Back then  People don't believe  That was moving  That fast  My whole life  That was good  But my whole life  Was like that  My head moved fast  I never examined anything  I made my  You look at it  I was like a cyborg  You look at it  You made your assumption  And your assumption  Didn't have to be right  But that's the assumption  You made  And you just work on that 
[03:09:00]  You know  Was it hard to  Just live life  Or were you constantly  In fighter mode  Constantly in fighter mode  Constantly  Yeah  Wow  So it was hard to  For relationships  Or just friendships  Hard for anything  Man  Somebody came in a room  Over 200 pounds  He could be a lawyer  I'm sizing him up  You're sizing him up  Yeah  Jesus Christ  What did you say  Instead of saying  Excuse me  What did you say  And how fucking scary  Would that be  God damn Mike  That's just how  Custom model  Programmed me  How many street  How many street fights  Did you have 
[03:09:30]  During that time  A few hundred  No joke  My whole life  Yeah  A few hundred  When you were  Yeah  When I first started  Fighting and stuff  You fought every day  Three times a day  You fight every day  You ever get your ass  Kicked back then  Yes  Really  Who kicked Mike Tyson's ass  Some girls jumped me  And beat the shit out of me  You know  Come on  No really  Is that a true story  Two sisters  Jumped me  And beat the shit out of me  One and bit my finger  Ah  I'm gonna fucking  Fuck you  Classic man  The stuff about  The ex 
[03:10:00]  Was fucking awesome  The way you talked about  Your ex-wife  You covered that  But it was like  Brutally honest  And really really  That was  People  People loved  Hearing that  Nobody could really  Be angry  Because they stole  Their stuff  She did her stuff  She did a little  Symposium  In all the college  It's not like  She went to some  Place in Browns  Or some little  Wick center  You know  She went to  University  Doing a symposium  On my ass  Right  In the university  And I'm walking down  The street  And he's seeing  These nice  Sophisticated white  Leaders moving  To the side  Like he's back  In segregation 
[03:10:30]  What the fuck  Did I do  You know  I didn't even meet  It yet  Wow  Where were you  Sitting in  I was in the  ILC  Probably about  15 or 16 rows  Back  And it was just  From the second  You walked out  It was just  It was very  Very casual  It obviously  You had put  A lot of work  Into it  But I loved  Not feeling  Like I was being  Given  You were hearing  A guy talk  Very honestly  And that to me  Was my favorite part  It was like  You didn't talk  So the language  The fact that  I'm talking about  My act  I'm just talking  About what happened  In my life  No doubt about it  I brought everything  On myself  Cheating on 
[03:11:00]  Probably kicked the ass  Whatever the situation is  You know  Everybody knows  That it's my fault  Even though she did  Real bad things  She was married  To a real rotten guy  At the time  You know  I was just a kid  I wanted everything  You know  Yeah  So I'm just telling  From my perspective  I'm not saying  Well hey  They're all bad  And I'm all good  You know  They already said  Their part about me  And I wasn't always  Good  But this is my angle  Yeah sure  Well it was very  That was the funny part  Was the honest language  It was nice to hear  Someone just talk that openly  Without worrying 
[03:11:30]  Like there was nothing  You said where it seemed  Like you were worried  About getting in trouble  Like we do understand  Men and women  Sometimes we break up  But we're still having sex  We just have sex  And then we go  On our way  Still banging  Shit that's hot  Oh listen  You're talking about  The guy that's the honest  If that never happened  In your life  You said  It's over with us  But we're still  Working it out  Sexually  It's not over sexually  That's why you see  These girls  And these guys  When I broke up  With my boyfriend  Last week  No it's not over yet  You come and see me  60 days from now  You'll be near 60 days  After the breakup 
[03:12:00]  To get over sexually  Alright that's  Going to be the last time  Still getting that dick  That's going to be the last time  After this feeling  I can live without the feeling  And then I'll move on  That's how it is  Anybody know  You stick with your ex  Even though you break up  Until you find somebody  Whose sex is better  Or just as good  Wow  You know that's just  The real deal  There's a tip for everyone  Yeah  That's only if you can do it  Something you can't do  Let me just stick right here  To 2014  And should it be better  I'm always willing  To keep fucking  But they never are  Like I'm always trying 
[03:12:30]  To fuck a couple more times  Trying to get a couple more  Why is it like that  How come we still have  That connection sexually  When you hate their guts  You despise them  Because part of  Because what makes them dirty  Isn't what makes them  A good person usually  It's usually what makes them  Their lack of inhibitions  But it's true  The lack of inhibitions  Makes them a great fuck  It's the thing that makes them  Hard to fight with  Makes them willing to be  Dirty in bed  Which is what I kind of need  So I'm expecting craziness  I love the girls  Looking over like  Really getting an education  And lovely ladies on the couch  Are like  Really Jim  I'm sorry 
[03:13:00]  I didn't even know you were here  I apologize  That's hilarious  But it's true  I'm attracted to crazy girls  I'm not attracted to nice girls  No listen  When I see my fans  You know  And people say  Hey what do you think  About these people  Come and roll  Dancing now  I said listen  Everyone  Any celebrity  This is what you really  Have to know  This is what  We don't want to do  The self examination  This is real scary  Doing this shit  Fuck Aristotle  Right  When we see our fans  Our fans  Believe it or not  Even your fans  They're a reflection of us  And sometimes we see  Our fans  We don't like that shit 
[03:13:30]  We don't like who we are  We don't like  These are some crazy motherfuckers  But we got the brakes  Cool  Our circumstances make us  Put on some brakes  Not much with Cyrus  Radio  But we got some brakes  Right  These people are uninhibited  They go to other lengths  That we're capable of going  Amazing  We're capable of going that length  But we're conscious about  But they're not  They continue to go  Keep going  Yeah and that's us  We think God  We don't listen to fucking rules  And shit  But we do  Because we know  We got shit to lose  But we don't want to listen  To rules  And fuck yeah  Fucking do it  Yeah 
[03:14:00]  That's what I really want to do  That's what I know  I better not  My wife is going to kill me  I'm going to say  Fuck off dude  I'm your fucking ass  And don't bother me no more  Holy shit  You can't do that  You can't do that  Yes sir  Yes sir  No sir  You got to check the show  Man  It's on Sunday  No ma'am  Yes sir  Yes ma'am  Yes sir  No ma'am  I'm sure  Yes sir  My addiction to precarious

[03:15:00]  He asked me  Are you scared of white people  And then a Romney picture  Flash behind him  I'm scared of that white motherfucker  It was funny  I don't want any trouble  And stuff  But it was  It's almost like  When you're that honest  Nobody  There's no way for people  To criticize you  Because you're being brutally honest  What can they do to you  If you tell the truth  And it's really  It's like being in a mob  If you're the mob leader  You can't tell on nobody  But yourself  You're the leader  Another great thing  Was you shitting on people  In Staten Island  Who want to act like  They're mobbed up  When they're not  Do you know people  In Staten Island 
[03:15:30]  Act like they're mobbed  It's a weird place  It's weird right  We don't know much about it  They all got the jackets  The blader  And the fucking sweatsuits  The young guys  The sweatsuits  The fucking  What's that stuff  You shoot yourself up with  Steroids  Steroids  The sweatsuits  The chains around the neck  The tight chokers  With their wife  You know  Just looking around  Flexing on the corner  Yeah  They point with their pinky  And ring finger  Hey  My friend  My friend  I'm sure you're not aware

[03:16:30]  They showed they were before  Once you're vulnerable  You can't be the tough guy no more  Right  And that kills them  More than anything  Do you think you're in that boat  Right now  Like you've shown  Your vulnerability  That you're  You know  More of a regular guy  Than we ever thought  Yeah  But just like the mob guys  And those guys  They're regular guys  That can do extraordinary things  Yeah  You know  And I never leave that in perspective  I want to be a regular guy  Yeah  But the world won't let me  Be a regular guy  So I have to look at it  For what it is  I can do incredible things 
[03:17:00]  For the betterment of humanity  I think more so now though  For myself  I think you've shown like  More of yourself  These days recently  Over the past few years  And I think more people are seeing  Like you're a regular guy  You're a fun guy  You know  You like having a good time  And it's not just Mike Tyson  That goes and rips people's heads off  I feel you  And you have issues with my kids  But he can still do that  You know  You know  You want to develop a relationship  With your kids  You know  My oldest daughter was there  We're estranged a little bit  We  Periodically  We keep in touch  And it was just so awesome  This is the first time

Thank you  Thank you  It's a pleasure to be too  Yeah  What do you  On the mic yeah  We don't bite  We're big fans  We'll be very nice  Yeah  Yeah  Thank you  Sorry  What is  I think we forced him 
[03:25:00]  To come in here  He smelled something  Sorry  Robert just ate  He just ate eggs  By way of sitting  I had eggs  Egg whites  I've never smelled  Egg whites smell like that  Terrible right  Speaking of egg whites  He's got a cookbook  Yes  How do you provide  I know what Stanley's up to  Cookbook  Yeah  Are you a good cook  Or are these recipes  From other people  No the recipes  From other people  But I'm an okay cook  Oh okay  Yeah  I suck at it  What kind of food  Are you cooking  Is it Italian food  It's Italian food 
[03:25:30]  Yeah  That's great  Yeah  Best  What's your favorite  Italian dish  I don't have one  Really  There's so many  I just  You know  I just got back  From Italy  I went on my  Honeymoon  And we  Went to northern Italy  Like to Piedmont  And I've never  I mean the food  Was incredible  But they had this  This pasta  With  Just simple pasta  With mushrooms  And then truffles  On top  Oh my god  Nice  Is the difference  Between American  Italian food  And Italy  Italian food  Like really that big  Because I've heard  It's not really similar  It's not  It's more similar  Now than it used to be 
[03:26:00]  Because before  It was just a lot  Of like really heavy sauce  And like kind of  Really gross stuff  You know  But now it's  People understand  A little bit more  What you know  Real Italian food is  Yeah  It's simpler over there  Though  Their food is  Just kind of simple  Yeah  And the portions  Are like human  You know  Where it's like  It really has  Become that here  Like people just  Feel that  If you don't get  A huge portion  You're getting ripped off  It's a gimmick  To get people  In the restaurant  From time to pasta  With every meal  Yeah  You don't see the words  Family style  In Italy  Family style 
[03:26:30]  Is for one person  After all the vendettas  What's the name  Of the cookbook  It's true  It's called  The Tucci family cookbook  Nice  So you guys  Are having a good time  Aren't you  Yeah  This is like a great job  It really is  It doesn't suck  You just come in  The worst part  Is just getting up  Early  Yeah  But then after that  It's all downhill  What time do you have  To be up  Five-ish  Oh yeah  And then once you're in  It's just goofing around  So yeah  It's not like a real work 
[03:27:00]  I had a real job  So you know  Don't look at me like  You know  I've never had one of those  Silver spoon in my mouth  You probably did  Before acting  There was nothing  What did you do  You must have a trade  I attended bar  I painted apartments  Alright  Okay  You know  Stuff like that  See a lot of times  We'll have  Actors will have early calls  We'll have to be there  Are you putting yourself  In the same category  As a Stanley Tuesday  A couple of men  Of similar ilk  Just talking about show business  I don't believe  It's similar ilk  I don't think you're  In the same ilk park  You're probably right  He's in the ilk park 
[03:27:30]  We're a member of the ilk  How did you go from  Painting apartments  And stuff to acting  Well no  I mean I was trying to act  You know  And I'd have jobs  Intermittently  And then when I needed money  I would paint apartments  Oh okay  Because I was  It was something that I did  When I was a kid  To make money  Yeah yeah  So then you know  It was something to fall back on  And if you didn't want to  I mean I was trained  As a bartender too  When I was in college  What a great way  To just get some extra cash  So if I needed it  I could bartend or whatever 
[03:28:00]  But ultimately I ended up  Painting apartments  I actually liked that better  Because I could control my hours  When did you realize  Like wow  I don't have to do that work anymore  I could act full time  I'm not quite there  You're not there  You're still  Look I do have a wall  That's peeling a bit  At the house  If you want to come by  And take a roller to it  I'll do it  I'll do it  I mean that's why  I have a cookbook  I'm nervous  Yeah there you go  Yeah  Diversified  Alright  Yeah you gotta go  Alright yeah you gotta go  Thanks for saying hi  I'm so flattered  Big fans man  I mean it was very nice  Of you to just pop in

[03:29:00]  Obi and Anthony's worst of 2012  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  Continues right now  Yes  Worst of 2012  Opin' Anthony show  My name is E-Rock  In this segment here  We speak to Damien Eccles  From the West Memphis 3  Damien has been out of jail  For a little bit  He wrote a book  He's doing a book tour here  And we talk to him  Get some in-depth information  As far as what this guy  Has gone through all his life  His life in prison  And how is he adjusting 
[03:29:30]  To being outside of the prison system  Damien Eccles  From West Memphis 3  Fame  Right now  This is O&A's worst of 2012  Well let's get Damien in here  We've been very excited  About this all morning  Yes  One of the Memphis 3  Damien Eccles  Hi  Promoting his new book  Hey Damien  What's up man  Welcome to the show  Take a seat  We've been looking forward  To this all morning sir  All morning  Thank you  Nice to meet you brother  Nice to meet you  There you go bro  Oh 
[03:30:00]  Good to see you  Out and about  Thank you  Absolutely  This your first one of the day  It is  Yeah  I'm getting to the point  Where I'm sort of  Sleepwalking through everything  Really  I can't even remember  Anymore what I'm doing  How many interviews  Have you done  I mean it's gotta be  It's gotta be a hundred interviews  Since you  More than that even  I can't even count anymore  I think originally  Just the day of the book signing  They had me scheduled  To do 14 in one day  Jesus  Wow  That's crazy  But I mean even  Going far back to the time  Where you were in jail  I mean it just seems like 
[03:30:30]  You know everybody  Wanted to talk to you  It's um  Well it really  It's what got us out of prison  Just the fact that the media  And the people on the street  Cared  You know I never had  Any faith in the system  Whatsoever  I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt  They would kill us  Wow  The only thing I didn't  That I did have faith in  That I never lost faith in  Was um  The people who kept  Following the case  Who cared about it  No you have to know  Also that there are  People in prison  Right now  That know they're innocent  And there's really 
[03:31:00]  No recourse  How do you  Why do you think  You guys really  Kind of got  Where people picked up  Your case  And put it in  The public eye  I think it started off  With the Paradise Lost movies  People would see those  And identify with them  In some way  They would think  This could have been me  This could have happened to me  I could have been  In this situation  But can I stop you  For a second  Because it makes a good  But how did the  The movie even get made  You know there's probably  A lot of interesting stories  With guys in jail  But they're never going to 
[03:31:30]  Get their documentary  Going back to Ed's point  Well that actually started  Because of the  The initial media reaction  Whenever  Well it started off  When the head of the  HBO documentary division  Saw a small article  In the New York Times  About a satanic killing  In Arkansas  So she sent a film crew  Down there  Thinking it was  An open and shut case  That they're going to get  This case on film  Of these guys  Who had committed  These murders  As an act of  As part of a satanic  Let's get the monsters  On video  Exactly  They thought it was  Just going to be 
[03:32:00]  This huge sensational thing  And then whenever  They got down there  They started filming  And they said  Wait a minute  Something's up here  This is something else  The first documentary  Though really doesn't  Show you guys  As innocent  So how did that  Kind of  Get the ball rolling  Where people  Wanted to  Come to your defense  Yeah I was up in the air  After the first one  I didn't know how to feel  It didn't look  Like it was like  Yeah I mean  These guys don't look  Really guilty  I wasn't 100% convinced  Right  It wasn't like  Oh my god  What are they doing  In prison  Yeah  That was kind of  The whole point of it  They didn't want it 
[03:32:30]  To be biased  In any direction  They just wanted to  Capture exactly  What was happening  In the courtroom  And that's  What spoke to so many people  The fact that they  Came away not knowing  Whether they were  Guilty or innocent  And that's not  What the court of law  Is supposed to be  The court of law  Is supposed to be  Guilt  Innocent  Until proven guilty  That has to make you  Like chuckle at this point  Yeah  Exactly  You are  When you  When you look back  On the whole  The whole  Process  And who  Is there anybody  You can find  That you  Dislike the most 
[03:33:00]  Out of that whole thing  I mean  Would it be  The original trial judge  Or the prosecutor  Or the appeals  The prosecutor  Who finally came out  At the end  And I guess  Offered the Alfred play  Who among all those people  Do you kind of  Really have the most  Dislike for  If anybody  I guess if I sat around  Thinking about it  It would be all of them  Yeah  You know  There were so many of them  That played  A huge role  In trying to murder me  And that's a hard thing  To get past  That's a hard thing  To get over  The judge  Especially  You know 
[03:33:30]  Even to this day  He  Even after the DNA  Evidence started coming out  He still to this day  Denies that there is  Any new evidence  Because it makes him  Look bad  Exactly  And to exchange  Your own saving face  For people's lives  Is amazing  And this is a person  Who supposedly  Is in a place of  You know  Power, respect  And supposed to be  Fair and equal  Just astounding  Well he's a politician  You know  In society  We're  Sort of  Fed this belief 
[03:34:00]  That these people  Judges  Prosecutors  Attorney generals  They have these jobs  Because they're somehow  Moral people  And in actuality  They are  Politicians  The same as senators  The same as congressmen  Advancing their careers  They will do and say  Anything they have to  In order to win  That next election  Literally leaving  A wake of dead people  Exactly  To try to get  Up that next notch  Exactly  Disgusting  And when you're dealing  With the local media  I mean you have to  Take into consideration  That the media  Is under no obligation  To tell you the truth 
[03:34:30]  They're a business  And just like any other business  Their number one priority  Is to make a profit  So come election cycle  These politicians  Are pumping  Millions of dollars  Into this local media pool  I on the other hand  I'm giving them  Absolutely nothing  So whose side  Are they going to spend  Yeah yeah  That revenue  Coming in during election years  I mean they're spending  Like you said  Millions on advertising  Amazing  When you were sentenced  To death too  I was wondering this too  The original moment  They had said  Okay this is when  We're going to give you 
[03:35:00]  The lethal injection  And obviously it passed  What were you doing  At that moment  When you knew  That that's what was  Quote unquote  Supposed to be happening  In the system's eyes  Like were you looking  At the clock  Or did you just  Sleep through the night  Or were you aware  Like right now  I should actually  Not be alive  If they got their way  My original execution date  Was May 5th of 1994  And it was one of those things  That you don't know  What to do with it  You know there are  Very few things in life  You're ever going to have  Of that magnitude  And you just  It's like you can't 
[03:35:30]  Get handholds in it  You know you try  To think about it  But you can't  Get your mind around it  The fact that  At this moment  Right now  These people are supposed  To be murdering me  Wow  That if not for getting  The stay of execution  These people would be  Murdering me  Right now  And you feel like  You know  The worst part is that  You know you didn't do it  Yeah  That you  And I mean  That's the everyday thing  Every time you're  Beaten by a guard  Every time anything  Bad is going on 
[03:36:00]  It's the fact that  You know I was never  Supposed to be here  In the first place  And that's almost  Worse than what it is  You're going through  Oh man  How were the guards  Or the inmates  Because you know  I mean I've never  Spent time in prison  And what was their  Reaction to you  Because it was such  A high profile case  And who did you find  Treated you with  Some respect or dignity  And who didn't  Well when you're  On death row  The prisoners there  It's different than  Every other part of the prison  There's a sort of  Solidarity there  Just because you have  A common enemy 
[03:36:30]  You know  You're sort of  Banded together  More than the rest  Of the prison  Just because  You're all fighting  For your lives  Against the people  Trying to kill you  So anytime  I was in fear  Of my life  Of my life in prison  It was never  From a prisoner  Every single time  It was from guards  And they took out  Their anger  Yeah  A lot of times  It's just because  They can  You know  When I first got there  They decided  They were going to  Give me a  Welcome to the  Neighborhood party  So they took me  To the part of the prison 
[03:37:00]  They call the hole  It's like this really  Dark part of the prison  Where in the summer  It can get up to  120 degrees  And you're in  Complete isolation  And they can do  Anything they want to  And for the next  18 days  They beat the  Living hell out of me  They used to come in  At about midnight  Or one o'clock  In the morning  And they'd chain me  To the bars in the cell  And beat me with night sticks  And they beat me so bad  At one point  I started to piss blood  Oh fuck  And the only reason  They didn't kill me  Was because a deacon 
[03:37:30]  From the catholic church  Who used to come in  Bringing communion  To the other prisoners  Found out about it  And he went to the warden  And said  I know what you're doing  I know you're killing  This guy  And if it doesn't stop  I'm going to go public  I'm going to tell people  About it  And that's the only reason  They didn't kill me  Did you have an incident  With the warden too  Himself  Didn't the warden himself  Participate  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  He choked me  They took me up  Into the warden's office  One night  It was the warden  And two guards  And while the guards  Were beating me  The warden was choking me 
[03:38:00]  Kicking me  Un-fucking-believable  It's  You know  That was one of the reasons  That I took this  People asked  Did you have any  Reservations about  Taking this deal  You know  The Alfred plea  And the answer is  No because I was dying  You know  My health had gotten  So bad over the years  I weigh  I've gained 60 pounds  Since I've been out of prison  Wow  Did your relationship  With the guards  Ever get better  As the case got more notoriety  And people started thinking  Well you know  Maybe this guy is innocent 
[03:38:30]  Did any of the guards  Change their opinion on you  One way or another  It's all the same to them  You know  You're just somebody else there  What was the warden thinking  Was he  Were you acting up in prison  No it was just because  He saw me on TV  The prisons  They hate  Whenever any sort of  Media attention  Is drawn to the prison  Whatsoever  Sure  And like you were just saying  You know  People were wanting to come in  And do interviews and stuff  With me from the very beginning  And he did not like that at all  He saw that as me  Bringing attention  Onto the prison  You know  At the 
[03:39:00]  Right before I got out  The past year  Before I got out  Was  The brutality  Had escalated  Like a hundred fold  Because  One of the guards  At  Another prison  Had been involved  In a beating  Where an inmate  Was beaten so bad  He lost an eye  And the media  Got wind of it  And wrote a few  Newspaper stories  And the administration  Said okay  We gotta get this guy  Out of here  So instead of firing him  They promote him to warden  And send him to my prison  Oh man  And that's the reason  They don't want  You know  The media attention 
[03:39:30]  Yeah  You talked  By the way  Your book  He's promoting  Life after death  And I'm almost  I got like 30 pages left  You're an amazing writer  And I know that you talk  About not wanting  To be a freak show  Like you don't want  People just looking at you  Like okay  Here's the guy  Who went to jail  For this  And I have to be honest  The writing stands up  On it's own  Like it was  Really interesting  To read  About these  Experiences  Before the murders  Before you know  With that  The truant officer 
[03:40:00]  Driver  And the time  You spent  In a mental hospital  And didn't even know  You could fight it  And it's kind of  Mixed in with just  These things you wrote  In jail  And I think it was  Fascinating  I guess  Did that keep you sane?  It did  Writing and meditation  And my wife  Those were the things  That kept me alive  And there  Kept me from losing my mind  I've loved writing  Ever since I was  About 12 years old  It's like it  Scratches an itch  Somewhere deep inside of you  That nothing else gets to  And that was my hope  With this  Is that if I thought  This was you know 
[03:40:30]  Just a car wreck  That people would  Want to gawk at  Then I wouldn't  Have wanted to put it out  I wanted to make sure  It was something  That stood on its own merit  And my hope is that  You know people  Will like the writing style  People will like the voice  Enough that they'll  Want to read about  Something other than  The cane  Yeah you guys have  Been humanized though  To a point where  People will  And do  Read it  And read about the story  And not just say  Okay here's  Person A, B, and C  Like your people  Your personalities  Are out there 
[03:41:00]  It really isn't  Just like a freak show  Because a lot of people  Feel they know you  They can identify with you  So yeah I don't think  You have to worry about  That freak show aspect of it  Thank you  You mentioned your wife  In there  And I saw the Anderson  Cooper interview yesterday  Right  I was amazed to see  Your wedding pictures  From death row  That was so strange to me  Because obviously  An extremely happy occasion  But it's happening  On death row  What was going through  Your mind that day  Just shock 
[03:41:30]  A lot of it  Really I hadn't  At that point  I hadn't had human contact  In like seven years  Something like that  We've been married  Oh we've been together  For about 17 years now  But at that  Whenever we were  First married  That was the first time  We'd actually gotten  In touch  Wow  So you know  Just that we had  It was  It's a weird thing  To know this person  To see this person  All the time  To have these  You know conversations 
[03:42:00]  With this person  And this relationship  With this person  And it's almost like  You forget that you  Haven't even touched  Right  Until you do touch them  So it was a very  Surreal experience  Were people mad  That you were getting  Married on death row  I don't think they knew  Most people didn't know  At the time  It was you know  The case wasn't nearly  As big back then  As it grew to be  In later years  So most people  Didn't pay it any attention  But I mean the people  Around death row  Oh yeah  The guards  They were like  Jesus  They don't like that at all  They hate it right  I would imagine  And also 
[03:42:30]  Were you ever afraid  Being married  Because I'm so paranoid  In a relationship  Like when I see a girl  Every day  Is it hard when you're married  And you think like  You don't know  If you're ever going to get out  Like how long  Is she going to stay with me  Are you constantly afraid  If she doesn't call on time  Like has she met somebody  Is she you know  Does that ever play in your head  When you're locked up  Not in that way  What I worried about  Was not that  Lori would ever leave  But that she would become  So worn down  By this situation  That it would completely  Steal her life  You know she  At one point  She had to take out  Two loans  Just to pay off legal fees 
[03:43:00]  She quit her job  To work full time  On this case  She did  Or had a hand in  At least 85%  Of the work  That was done in this case  You know she did more work  Than the attorneys  And the private investigators  Combined  So what I was scared of  Is that it was just  Going to wear her down  That she was going to  Reach the point  Where she just  Couldn't do it anymore  Can we ask Lori a question  Do you have a mic for her  Because she's here  I'm just curious  Because you have been  Such a big part of this  When you first heard 
[03:43:30]  About this case  What were your  Was it from Paradise Lost  The documentary  Or had you heard about it before  It was  It was from Paradise Lost  And what did you think  Well I mean  There were so many  Questions that I had  About the case  And you know  Just that were brought up  From the film  And there was so  There wasn't that much  Out there at the time  That was in 96  So I just knew  I wanted to find out more  And I knew I wanted  To help Damien  And did people question  Because like you know  Your family  And do all these people 
[03:44:00]  Around you question  Why are you communicating  With this person  You know my friends  Were all supportive  And the only way  I know how to answer that  Is I just didn't give  Them any room  To question me  I just  I knew I  I just was  Just hell bent on  For whatever reason  I just knew  This is what I wanted  To do  And no one  I didn't even tell  My family though  For four years  Because  Oh wow really  Yeah  Yeah I just wanted  To be  Have a sense  Of be established  In what I was  And understand 
[03:44:30]  What I was doing  Before I put it  The interesting part  Is that  You really do get  A stronger relationship  I think  And at least  The two of you  Could know  That it's not based  On some kind of  Superficial thing  I mean if anything  Could be taken from that  Wow  I'm sure Damien knows  That you authentically  Love him  To have to go through that  And again  Without the contact  Without things that  People normally take  As a relationship 
[03:45:00]  Not being there  There has to be  Something pretty strong  Between you two  Well yes  And our relationship  Is based on communication  It had to be  And I think  You know  So many people  Forget about that  Or they get busy  In their lives  And they forget  To even sit down  And talk  You know  We'd sit down  And talk for three hours  At least a week  Wrote every day  Talked every day  So  Not that that's everything  Because there's a lot more  To relationships  But that's a pretty  Strong foundation  And the book is  Honestly fantastic  You talked about things  In jail 
[03:45:30]  Which I would never  Have thought of  Like I'm literally  Almost done  And there's a part  Right where I just read  Where you talk about  The mosquitoes  Like I've never heard  Anybody talk about  The mosquitoes  In prison  But what are the things  Is that a gang?  Yes  Bunch of guys  With little dicks  Jimmy  What are the things  About jail  Do you think  That people just  Don't talk about?  Well I think  That is one of the things  That most people  Wouldn't think about  Because whenever  You know  Most people get their  Information about  Prison from movies  And that's  You know  That's not going 
[03:46:00]  To be a very  Fascinating part  Of the movie  To focus on mosquitoes  But I mean  You take into things  Like that  Like the rats  You have a rat season  And a cricket season  In prison  Where in the winter  When it gets really cold  The rats  And you're out  In the middle of nowhere  In the middle  Of all these fields  So the rats  All start coming  Into the prison  To try to get out  From the cold  And try to get away  From the lack of food  And everything else  So you'll wake up  At night  Whenever I first  Got there one night  I kept hearing  This noise  Like somebody  Was rubbing styrofoam  And I kept thinking  What the hell is that  And then I rolled over 
[03:46:30]  And there was a rat  Looking you know  Directly into my face  It was chewing on my hair  Was what it was  You can't let  Your blanket  Touch the floor at all  Or they'll climb up  Onto the bed with you  You can't leave  Anything to eat  Laying around  Or they're going to  Swarm in there  That and in the summer  For some reason  These big black crickets  Come in  And the whole floor  At points  You can't even walk  Without crunching them  Because they're just  You know  Covering everything  The mosquitoes  The same way  You're in the middle  Of all this field  So at night  They breed out there 
[03:47:00]  And at night  That's one of the things  That will drive you  To the point of madness  You know  They're biting your lips  And your eyelids  And they're buzzing  In your ears  While you're trying to sleep  And you know  Parts of the prison  Can reach 120 degrees  In the summertime  So you can't put on clothes  You just lay there  Covered in your own sweat  And filth  While these things  Are eating you alive  Oh my god  And the whole time  You're just going  I'm not even  Supposed to be here  That's the part  It's like  These people  Have no right  To do this to me  I'm not supposed  To be here 
[03:47:30]  Did you go through  Waves of  Because I got angry  Watching these documentaries  Especially as they went on  And your innocence  Became even more  And more apparent  How do you deal  With what should be  Just constant rage  What does that flow into  In the beginning it was  It got to a point  In the first two or three years  Where I would wake up  In the morning furious  From the moment  My eyes would open  I was just furious  And it was making  The situation even worse  It was eating me alive inside  And I knew I had to find 
[03:48:00]  Some sort of way  To deal with it  And that's what made me  Turn to meditation  I was eventually  I received yukai  Ordination in the  Rinzai Zen tradition  Of Japanese Buddhism  Which is the same tradition  That used to train the samurai  And that's what I turned to  To get control of that  Also there's almost  No medical care in prison  You know they're not going to  Spend a lot of time  And money taking care of  Someone they plan on killing  So that's  I had no choice  But to turn to  A lot of energy work  You know qigong  Reiki  Things of that nature 
[03:48:30]  Just to deal with the pain  And the sickness  And suffering  And everything else  That I was going through  You know if I were out  And I could have went  To see a doctor  Or something  I probably never  Would have devoted myself  To those things  The way I did in there  But I didn't have a choice  What kind of illnesses  Did you have?  Oh god I don't even know  Just because there was  Nothing diagnosed  I think I was becoming  Pre-diabetic  At one point  Just because I was  Dying of thirst  All the time  Having to piss  Every five minutes  I would wake up  In the middle of the night  And my kidneys  Would just be hurting  But I think that was a lot 
[03:49:00]  Due to the beating  My teeth were  Really bad  I had a lot of nerve damage  From being hit in the face  So many times  And you know in prison  There are no root canals  There are no crowns  There are no caps  There are none of that  Your choices are  Live in pain  Or let them pull your teeth out  Now you took the Alfred  Obviously it was understandable  Why because you know  They're going to execute you  Is there any  Like I'm watching the prosecutor  In the third documentary  Watching this guy  Fucking stand there  And go  Well the lawsuit  Was definitely  And it's not the same prosecutor  From the entire trial 
[03:49:30]  But the guy who's  Representing the state  Now I guess  But to watch them  Consider a lawsuit  Like how enraging  Is it  That that's a piece  Of his motivation  In giving you  Your freedom  Is the fact that  He doesn't want you  To be able to sue  For what they stole from you  Which was almost  20 years of your life  That was also another reason  That I knew  I had to take this deal  Because he admits  In West of Memphis  Our documentary  That one of his considerations  Was the fact that  Were we acquitted  The three of us together  Collectively  Could have sued the state  For about 60 million dollars 
[03:50:00]  I knew also  They could have me  Stabbed to death  For 50 dollars  Any day  You know  I wasn't going to live  To see outside those walls  They were not going to  Pay that money  Whether it was  You know  Just from degenerating  Health conditions  Or them having me killed  Either way  I wasn't coming out  Of there alive  Now what would it take  For you to be able  To sue them  Now I know you've signed  To me that's like  Signing a contract  Like you know  The way Luca Brazzi  Got the band leader  To sign it over  I mean that's  That's a gun at your head  And it's not fair  To consider that  A value  Or a viable contract  What would you need 
[03:50:30]  To be able to go  And sue  And in this case  I think being able  To sue is completely justified  They would have to  Reopen the case  Which they're not  That's not happening  Because they don't  Want to pay the money  How about if you were  Pardoned  Is there any way  Would that be a presidential  Pardon  Or is the governor  Able to do anything  About that  I don't know  I think the governor  Probably could  But at the same time  I'm not asking  For a pardon  Because a pardon  Means you're asking  For forgiveness  For something wrong  You've done  I haven't done anything  Right  So I don't want  Shit from these people  As far as a pardon 
[03:51:00]  Is concerned  So you're okay  With the alpha plea  No  But right now  It's the lesser of two evils  I mean we're going  To keep digging in  We're going to keep fighting  Keep working on this case  You know  One of the things  Right now  We found out  That the FBI  The FBI has about  200 pages of information  That no one's ever seen before  So we're trying  To get a hold of that  You know  Trying to invoke  This FOI act  All of that sort of stuff  To get this information  Turned over  And hope that there's  Something else in there  We could use  That you have to go  Through hoops  To get information  On your own 
[03:51:30]  Life  And what you've  Well I mean  Even the DNA testing  The state said  Okay we'll pay  For half of the testing  If you can come up  With the other half  Still they haven't  We had to raise  The entire thing  We had to pay  For all of the DNA testing  Which was how much  Do you know roughly  I have no idea  But it was a lot  I remember like  The initial round  Of testing  The very first round  Was $200,000  Oh wow  Wow  And we didn't have that  The only way  We even got that  Was because  Henry Rollins  Went on a tour 
[03:52:00]  Just to raise  That money  To pay for  That DNA testing  You know  If not for the people  That were helping us out  Yeah  I would be dead right now  What do you think  It's probably hard  To speculate  But what do you think  You'd be doing right now  Had you not been  Through all of this  Had no one ever  Accused you of anything  You're a kid  You're growing up  In you know  A small town  Pretty much  What do you think  You would have done  Where you'd be right now  It's impossible to say  Yeah  Maybe I would have 
[03:52:30]  Ended up stuck there  Or I would like to think  Have you ever thought  Of what you would have  Liked to have done  Then  Like what were your  What were kind of  Your dreams back then  Before this happened  I wasn't absolutely positive  I loved writing  Like I said  But at the same time  I would just  Have this feeling  I would get up  In the morning  That there's got to be  Something more to life  Than this  You know  I would look at  Everyone around me  That had just been  So worn down  And were already dead inside  And that looked like  They were you know  Somebody's grandparents  By the time they were 30  And I think 
[03:53:00]  There's got to be  Something more to life  Than this  Yep  Holy shit  You sure didn't belong  In the small town  USA  God damn  There's a funny part  Of the book too  Where you say  Like one of the things  During the trial  Is they took all your  Writings  And read them  Like these private things  That we do as teenagers  And you said  The only thing immortalized  Was my bad taste  Which made me laugh  Because we've all  Looked back at our  Awful  Melodramatic  Teenage  You have some  Horrid things  Dude I wrote a poem  When I was in rehab 
[03:53:30]  Kevin Smith actually  Read it on the show  It's fucking hideous  I mean  It really is humiliating  Like to have to have  That stuff read publicly  Especially when it's  Taken out of context  You know  Oh man  I mean  Just having it read  Like that would be  Bad enough  But when they take it  And warp it  And twist it  And try to make it  Look like something else  Like you're saying  Something else  It makes  Literally  When I first got to prison  I could not write  For at least a couple years  Because it traumatized me  So much  Having that done  You know  It scars you  That it took a long time 
[03:54:00]  And even now  It's still  It's still hard for me  Sometimes  If  Like if I walk up  Say Laurie's looking at  Something that I've written  On the computer  Or something  And I'm not  I don't know  She's doing it  And I just walk up  And see it  I immediately have this  Feeling like I want to run  Wow  I have to know  What's going to happen  And sort of prepare myself  For it  Gear up for it  And do you prepare her first  Go look  It's just a rough draft  I mean  It's not completed  Work in progress  Yeah  That's why  You lower their expectations  So if they don't like it  It's not as embarrassing  What was the first thing you did  When you got out of prison 
[03:54:30]  Eight  We went to  I was not ready for this  I mean  You've got to take into consideration  The fact that  I had been in solitary confinement  For almost a decade  Right  And then  I went from a decade  Of solitary confinement  To them saying  Okay get out  So  A party  Probably wasn't  The greatest idea  Yeah that's like  Shock  Exactly  But that's what we did  We had a rooftop party  We went across the bridge  Over to Memphis  And you know  There was a bunch of friends 
[03:55:00]  And family there  To celebrate  So the first thing  Was probably eat  Drink  And  Just  Try to deal  It was shock  For the first two or three months  That I was out  I was in such a deep  State of shock  And trauma  That  It was  You know  Lori would lead me around  Almost like she was  Leading a blind person  I would walk into doors  I would walk into people  On the street  Just because I wasn't  Ready for it  Because it's a follow up question  With that said  What do you think 
[03:55:30]  Of the world around you  Yeah that's what exactly  What amazed you  What like  Technological advancements  Yeah all that stuff  Well as soon as I got out  They handed me  An iPhone  And a computer  Holy shit  The computer  I still haven't  Figured out  A great deal about it  The iPhone  I can actually use now  But it was  There are no words  To even articulate it  When I went in  The last time I'd seen  A computer  Was 1986  And it was basically  A giant glorified typewriter  For really rich people  What are your dreams like 
[03:56:00]  At night  When you sleep  Do you remember them  Are they horrifying  Or are you just not  A victim of what you went through  When you dream  I don't dream a great deal  At night  Whenever I do  The ones I remember  Are usually the bad ones  Yeah  Whenever I first got out  The first few months  I would wake up in the night  Screaming a lot  Wow  It was  You know 
[03:56:30]  Scaring the hell out of Lori  You know  She wakes up in the middle of the night  With some guy in the room  Screaming  So that was kind of  Hard to deal with  What about when you first went in  Would you remember dreaming then  And were you out  And kind of free  Yes  And that was the worst  Then you wake up  Because a lot of times  We've talked about  Having dreams of  You're in trouble  Like I've had dreams  Where I'm in trouble  I'm in jail  Or you're in a horrible situation  You wake up  And you're like  Oh my god  Thank god  I just got out of trouble 
[03:57:00]  In the blink of an eye  And you on the other hand  It would be horrifying  To be free  Going about your life  And then wake up  And realize you're a caged animal  Yeah  Oh god  And you  I mean  You never see an end to it  It just  No light  It got to the point  By the end  Where I couldn't even remember  What it was like to be out anymore  You know  I spent half my life  And I was 18  When I went in  It's been 18 years in  And I got to the point  Where I could remember  You know  For example  That pizza  Had one time  Been my favorite food 
[03:57:30]  But I couldn't remember  What it tasted like anymore  And that's when you start  To get really scared  Because you can't  Envision  Or picture  Anything  Outside this concrete box  For the next thousand years  And you're a very well spoken guy  And a very lucid  And good writer  But when you were 18  And all of a sudden  You're on the stand  Fighting for your life  Is there anything  When you look back on it  That you're like  I wish I would have  Answered this differently  Or said that differently  Or had  In those moments  Like knowing 
[03:58:00]  That you actually  Were going to be convicted  And that it could  Is there anything  That you wish  You would have done differently  Or you know  Again  Is it 18 year old  It's kind of hard to  I could probably  Pick it apart  And do that  But at the same time  I mean  The overall answer  Would have to be no  Just because I know  It didn't matter  What I said  It didn't matter  What I did  They had their minds  Made up  Before we ever  Walked in that courtroom  You were the  Satan worshipping  Murderer  And whatever they had to do  To put you in that mold  That's what they were going to do 
[03:58:30]  As a kid  Did you believe in the system  Before you went through all this  Or  I didn't think a great deal  About it  I guess  You know  Most of my education  Came the way  Most people do  Through watching TV shows  Sure  So you think  The cops are the good guys  And if there is a bad one  He's like the rogue  You know  The bad apple  In the bunch  Whenever you actually go in  You realize  That the good one  Is actually the  The very rare thing  Or at least in Arkansas  It was  At the time we were arrested  The West Memphis Police Department  The whole police department  Was under investigation  From the FBI  Did you 
[03:59:00]  Did you have a rock solid alibi  That was just discredited  By these people  Yeah  They don't  They didn't care  Right  You know  For example  Your family comes up  And says  Well he was here  At this time  And they'll say  Well this is his family  They're going to lie for him  And the jury says  Oh that's right  And that's it  That's the end of the hell of us  What do you think of Jesse  And what he said  At the time  You know  Jesse was a mentally handicapped kid  He had an IQ of 72  I think they said  At the time  We were arrested  Like E-Rock  He operated somewhere 
[03:59:30]  Between the level  Of like an 8 to 10 year old  Child  And he obviously confessed  Exactly  And you know  That was one of the things  That it's just  Did that frustrate  The hell out of you  Like oh my god  What are you doing  In a way yeah  But in a way also  I mean I knew  What they did to me  The way they treated me  Right  You know  By the time it was over  I wanted to say  Whatever they wanted me to say  Just so they would stop  So I  You know  I can't even imagine  Somebody with an IQ of 72  Going through  Something like that  It is amazing  Because you never  Can imagine yourself 
[04:00:00]  Put in a situation  Where you would agree  To something  That didn't happen  And  To put yourself  At such peril  Because of that  But when they wear you  Down like that  I guess you  You're only human  It really is possible  To reach a point  Where you'll just say  Whatever they want  I mean look  How we finally got out  Yeah  We signed a paper  Basically  Really it's a guilty plea  That's what it all  Comes down to  I mean  It's a special kind  Of guilty plea  Where you still get  To maintain your innocence 
[04:00:30]  In effect  It's a way  So that you can't sue them  But in the end  It's still the same thing  That Jesse Miskelly did  It's saying  Okay I'll say  I did whatever  You want me to say  If you'll just stop  Did you ever  There was one part to  Where there was  The girlfriend  You had run away with  And were first  Arrested for  And sent to a mental hospital  Because her parents  Hated you  Because you were  This is before the murders  And then you said  I guess  Have you ever seen her again  Because you said  The last time  You touched her 
[04:01:00]  Was a kiss in the police car  That was just  Such a final moment  That was it  The only time  I ever saw her  After that  What I heard  Was that her parents  Sent her to some sort  Of deprogram  I mean they were  Hardcore fundamentalist  You know  Backwoods Christians  You know  Just like a step above  The snake handling  Poison drinking  Guys  So whenever they found out  That we had been having sex  To them  That was like  The ultimate evil  So they sent her  To some sort of  Deprogramming center  To get her back  On the straight and narrow  The only time 
[04:01:30]  I ever saw her again  After that  Was whenever she  Was on the stand  During the trial  That was it  Oh she testified  I didn't know that  Was it positive for you  Or was it negative  Or was it neither  Neither one really  They just brought her  On the stand  To say  They asked her  Did I have a knife  And she said yes  Thank you  Yeah  And I know you don't know  No one has any answers  On it really  But in purely an opinion  Do you think  Do you think  That Terry Hobbs  Had something to do with it  I mean I know it's hard  To accuse someone 
[04:02:00]  Because of all the stuff  With you and Mark Byers  That went back and forth  But it just  It doesn't look good  After that third documentary  No it doesn't  And people say  You know  Well you want to be careful  Of doing the same thing  To him that was done to you  But at the same time  Our entire case  Against him  Basically  When you see the movie  West of Memphis  This is pretty much  The case we would have  Put on  If there would have  Been a hearing  If there would have  Been a trial  So everything that we  Point towards him  Is all 
[04:02:30]  Physical evidence  You know  It's all either DNA  Or it's eyewitnesses  You know  Things of that nature  It's not hearsay  It's not ghost stories  It's not the fact  That he read Stephen King  Novels  Or wore black clothes  Right  You know  He says for example  That he never even saw  The victims  The day they were murdered  Right  Three witnesses  Have come forward  And said they saw him  With the victims  Within an hour  Of the time they were murdered  We did a lot of other stuff  That didn't make it  Into the film also  Just because there was  Nothing we could do with it  Like for example 
[04:03:00]  We found the truck  He had at the time  Of the murders  And Luminol tested it  And there was blood  In the truck  But it was so old  And degraded  It couldn't be identified  Same thing in his kitchen  We went into the house  Luminol tested  There was blood  Under the linoleum  In the kitchen  But it was so old  And degraded  That you know  It couldn't be identified  DNA couldn't do anything  With it  Exactly  Yeah  Wow  And you had a  There's also something  Where are you and Jason  Speaking again  I know that afterwards  You guys had a falling out  Over  Well technically 
[04:03:30]  It wasn't between Jason and I  It was between me  And the people making this movie  At one point  You know  I had read the movie script  And it was absolutely horrendous  I think it was written  By the same people  Who wrote like Hellraiser 6  Oh  So I started reading this thing  And it was horrible  And when I started  Speaking out against it  I started getting  You know  Phone calls  They're leaving messages  On my phone  Saying if you're  Interfering with our movie  We're going to sue you  Because you're  Interfering with our  Right to make a living  And all this kind of stuff  So I was put in a position 
[04:04:00]  Where I couldn't  Even defend myself  I was not supposed to talk  To anyone involved  With this movie  About this movie  Which included Jason  Because Jason was working on it  Oh  So you know  It wasn't actually  Between Jason and I  It was between me  And the movie makers  And it just sort of  Got shifted  To make it look like  It was between Jason and I  But you know  Finally we just  Started talking again  I said you know  If you want to try to sue me  Sue me  Yeah  Yeah that would be a little  That would look silly  In court  Crazy  I mean one victim  Basically suing another one  Yeah  Just terrible 
[04:04:30]  It seems  And rightly so  That you've been  All consumed with this  Throughout the time  Where you were in prison  And getting out  And afterwards  But what do you guys do  For fun  Like to get away  From this completely  What do you two  Like to do  Just to have a good time  I spent a lot of time  At the tattoo parlor  Yeah  For me that's  It's really  You know it may be  Physically painful  But it's  For some reason  It's really psychologically 
[04:05:00]  And emotionally soothing  And also that's where  Most of my friends are  You know the only  Friends that I've been  Making since I got  Out of prison  So I spend a lot  Of time there  We watch movies together  Laura and I  We go see movies  What type of movies  Do you like  The only thing  If it doesn't have  A monster in it  I don't watch it  Every now and then  She's actually banned me  From seeing her movies  Like she likes to see  French movies and things  And she says  I ruin it  Why do you just 
[04:05:30]  Ugh the whole time  You know  Toss and turn  And it gets to the point  Where the chair  Feels like it's made  Out of needles  You know  Jesus Christ  It feels like  This movie's been on  For six hours  When is this going to end  You know it's bad  When he goes  This is the worst thing  I've ever had in my life  Sitting in one sentence  Well let's again  Plug the book  Oh my god  Again  It's an unbelievably  Well written book  And it's not just  Rehashed facts  Of the case  The case is talked about 
[04:06:00]  But it's not just  Paradise Lost in print  I mean it's  Totally different  Things about  Damien's experiences  In prison  And before  And I knew  Almost none of this  And I had seen  All three documentaries  And it's called  Life After Death  And it's on sale now  It's a great  Fucking book  It's really really  Brilliantly written  Amazing  What an amazing story  It's almost like  If it was a movie  You wouldn't believe it  It's too  It's too crazy  To believe that  That could happen 
[04:06:30]  To a person  Dude you make  You make people  Question everything  Like you said  The cops are the good guys  And all these things  That you're kind of  Born and raised to believe  And it's like  It's just like  All that is shattered  Reading this  Yeah  Well it was shattered  For me living through it  You know that's  There's so many aspects  Of it that are hard  To get your mind around  Whenever you're going  Through it  And it just  It psychologically  Destroys you  It destroys the foundation  Of everything you think  You know about life  Yeah  Not just your personal  Life  And what it does  To you directly 
[04:07:00]  The physical abuse  And mental abuse  And what not  But yeah  It's a fracturing  Of everything  That's supposed to be right  Yeah  The whole construct  Of the system  Just means shit  And it makes you realize  People are crazy  Yeah  Do you hate when people  Try to relate to you  And have no experience  Like it  Like dude  I was waiting  For a bus one time  It was late  And you're like  You asshole  Yeah I actually had  Someone tell me  Sometimes  Like  They wondered  Who had it worse 
[04:07:30]  Because yeah  I'm in prison  But at the same time  I don't have to worry  About things like  Buying cat food  Oh yeah  Wow I'd hate to have to  Go out and buy cat food  That's a real  Lemons to lemonade attitude  But glass is half full  Well they're saying  Damien has to go  Because of the press  A lot of press  Very cool man  This was amazing Damien  Thank you guys  It was a pleasure  Meeting you sir  Ever since I saw  The first documentary  I thought the story  Was fascinating  You really came off  Even at that time  Like a very smart guy 
[04:08:00]  And like what the fuck  Is he doing in this situation  To see you pop out  On the other end of this  With any  Any bit of sanity  Is amazing  So  Thank you  Just amazing  To have you here  Thank you so much  Life After Death  I'm sorry man  Life After Death  It's in bookstores now  You can get it online  You can order it  It's a fucking  Great great book  Very cool  Damien Echols  More awkward moments  I see you  I mean I see  Epic fail  And foul mouth rant  It's fucking terrible  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's
