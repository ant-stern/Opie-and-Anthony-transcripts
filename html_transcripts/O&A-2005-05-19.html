<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in their characteristically crude banter.  A significant portion focused on the humorous fallout from a publicity stunt near a live news segment, orchestrated by intern Nathaniel and a listener who flipped off the camera.  The resulting confrontation with the reporter, who used explicit language, was highlighted, with the hosts repeatedly emphasizing the funny video footage circulating online.  A first-time listener called in, initially nervous but ultimately expressing enjoyment of the show's outrageousness.  Big Kev was in studio, recounting hilarious lightsaber battles with a “Master Poe” at a Star Wars premiere; he promised to share video footage later. The hosts also discussed executive producer Ben's absence, attributed to a previous night of heavy drinking.  They played a clip from their first show together, finding it incredibly embarrassing, and discussed Boy George's comments about a past relationship with a Bush singer.

The show continued with a discussion of Michael Bloomberg's diverse campaign ads, prompting Opie and Anthony to brainstorm a Spanish-language version of their "Bill's Dead" prank call, which they attempted (with poor pronunciation).  They further discussed Ben Sparks' continued absence, playing a parody song, "Herky Jerky," about his perceived quirks.  A caller complimented Anthony's imitation of the old lady from the "Bill's Dead" bit.  News items such as underfunded airline pensions and the political filibuster were briefly and humorously discussed.  A listener-initiated quiz determined whether the hosts were "indie yuppies" based on a New York Post article, exploring their clothing, music (grime, Bright Eyes, Coldplay), technology (iPod, Gmail, TiVo, cell phones), and lifestyle preferences.  A caller described a technologically advanced Nokia phone from a European commercial, leading to a broader discussion about technological advancements and the potential obsolescence of paper money, followed by talk of the upcoming PlayStation 3.  A field report from Travis and “Master Poe” confirmed that Ben had simply overslept.

The show then shifted to Opie and Anthony discussing selling their unwanted furniture on eBay, even suggesting signing their rollerblades.  They critiqued a Bright Eyes performance on *The Tonight Show*,  launching into a heated, vulgar debate about the political left and right. Frank Caliendo called in, briefly doing his George W. Bush impression, before the show cut back to the Nathaniel/reporter video. His call was interrupted by a rapid-fire succession of celebrity impersonations and shout-outs.

Rich Voss, his fiancée Bonnie, and Dave Mordal joined in studio.  The conversation focused on Voss's home (described in highly critical terms), his memorabilia, and Don Cheadle's Oscar nomination.  Voss recounted a story about meeting Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.  A scathing attack on the radio hosts of "Out to Lunch" followed, filled with insults and criticisms.  Audio from Big Kev's Star Wars event was played, including awkward and humorous interviews which were mocked by the hosts.  The segment ended with further commentary on the interviews and a mention of the upcoming weekend's show at Caroline's.

Further listener-submitted audio from Opie's Star Wars premiere interviews was played, featuring a man reading a children's book, a woman dressed as Princess Leia (who was the subject of a bizarre, unsubstantiated rumor), and two teenage boys.  Opie's sarcastic interviewing style was highlighted. The focus then shifted to playing and reacting to recordings of Opie's early radio shows, revealing a more enthusiastic and less cynical Opie.  This led to numerous interruptions, digressions, off-color jokes, impressions (Bill Curtis and Tim Russert), recollections of past segments, and tangents involving Rich Vos's comedic style and lack of knowledge.  The segment included vulgar language and concluded with more discussion of Opie's early work and a listener call.


The show concluded with Opie describing discovering a second mouse in his garbage pail, leading to a discussion about listener experiences with rodents and other pests (rats, cockroaches, raccoons). Callers offered various pest control advice,  including one who recounted a prank gone wrong involving feeder mice. Anecdotes about the speed of cockroaches and a deer crashing through a sliding glass door were shared, with frequent use of vulgar language by the hosts and callers.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you.  I love paying for sex. 
[00:03:00]  This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  And yeah, we're back.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for proper.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  God, that irritates me.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  You blundering bag of foots! 
[00:04:30]  You will be molested.  You're a phony!  Hey!  This guy's a great big phony!  How'd you like to hold my law, huh?  Shut up!  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  O and A brought you up!  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid! 
[00:05:00]  Okay, terrific!  What the hell was that one?  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  It's a date.  Today's the date?  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  The O and A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  We love being here.  We absolutely do.  Now people are going, uh-oh, they're going to bitch about something.  Nah, man.  That sounded sarcastic.  We haven't really bitched that much lately.  No, not at all.  But that sounded sarcastic.  We love being here.  We absolutely do.  Let me tell you about the month.  That's usually how it goes.  Usually when you say it like that, you're right.  You're lying. 
[00:06:00]  Nah, I'm very happy to be here.  Yes.  I enjoy the whole XM experience.  Do you want to go to line one?  What's that about?  It's funny.  It's funny?  All right.  I'm sure it's not really.  Let's go to Anthony's X.  Anthony's X.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Wow, your voice got deep.  Jesus, Anthony.  What the hell?  I just woke up.  Sorry.  Oh, you just woke up?  Yeah.  Hi, Anthony.  I just wanted to say today's the date since you can never seem to remember.  And thanks for all the checks.  I look forward to the next one.  No problem.  No problem.  Why is it that the listeners know more about us than we know? 
[00:06:30]  I just checked, and it is indeed May 19th.  What is May 19th?  That was my wedding anniversary.  I couldn't remember on the stand in court during my divorce.  I know.  What a complete tool.  He probably set his alarm just so he could smash it.  Of course.  He was waiting.  It's like, oh, today's the day.  I have to call up now, and this will be my clever angle for the show today.  There it is.  I got it.  Oh, I'm through. 
[00:07:00]  Yes, May 19th.  Well, happy anniversary, Anthony.  Oh, gee, thanks.  I forgot to give you a card.  Unless that guy called, it would have just came and gone like any other day.  There was a time it might have been a special day, but now it's just another day on the calendar.  It's a day.  One of 365 of them.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to get into the other big thing that happened this morning.  Oh, wow.  Look at the people calling up.  I guess they saw.  Of course they did. 
[00:07:30]  Paul and Vernon.  Hey, how's it going?  Paul and Vernon over here.  Yeah, what's up, Paul?  Long time listener, first time caller, being listening to you guys.  Welcome aboard.  Thanks.  First week in N.E.W.  Sorry, I'm a little nervous.  Listen, just calling about.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Why are you nervous?  Oh, dude, man.  You know, I'm not too cool on the phone with people.  You got your stars.  No, no.  Listen, let me, let me, listen.  XM, what, announced 4 million subs the other day.  That comes out to about 10 million listeners. 
[00:08:00]  Then you got people that are listening on the internet and then bootlegging the show, you  know, illegally and then, you know, buying past shows on eBay.com.  It's not a lot of people listening.  Well, I've been, you know, I've been, I paid for the subscription and, like I said, first  week since N.E.W.  Listen, you guys are going to, Paul, calm.  I got to punch out.  Why you got to punch out?  Why?  I got to go to work.  All right, I'm calming down, I'm calming down.  Yeah, just calm down.  I mean, we're doing a national show now, so, you know, anywhere from New York to, I don't 
[00:08:30]  know, L.A., people are listening to you right now, so it's not that big of a deal.  Yeah, right.  Take a deep breath and try to get it out.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  First time listening, well, all right, I'm fucking this up.  You guys are cool.  First time.  It works every time, man.  It works.  It's a psychological game you can play.  I love it.  Hey, listen, I need to hear, oh, Archie, what are you doing down there, Archie? 
[00:09:00]  Remember that?  Get coming at Archie.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Remember that one?  Wow.  The first week at NEW, I was driving home through New York State and over St. Peter's  Mountain.  I almost drove off the fucking cliff.  I had to pull over, man.  That's what happens.  You almost drive off a cliff.  Of course.  Dude, I'm telling you.  Why don't you get to the point of your phone call, sir?  Yeah, let's go, Paul.  Now that you're nice and relaxed.  All right.  I've seen the assault on the media this morning.  I guess, you know, I'm a little late on that. 
[00:09:30]  Punch out.  All right.  Bye.  You're not late.  You were the first guy calling in with it.  Wow.  He was really bad.  Our own Nathaniel just rocked this morning.  Another assault on the media.  Want to explain the assault on the media, Anthony, to the new listeners?  Oh, this is great.  Well, we're never happy anywhere we are with the promotion that the program gets.  We are egomaniacs, and we always assume we should be getting a lot more promotion than  we get.  And it never really happens.  So we have to make our own.  And the best way to do it, we have found, is there's free TV out there. 
[00:10:00]  Do you people know that?  Free television access.  You can get on any of the major networks and do a little commercial for whatever you want.  They're out there all the time.  You see them, the live news shots that are happening around your city.  Whenever an event happens, they send a schlep reporter down there with the truck and the  camera, and they go live, and then they go, let's now take it to Jim, who's standing outside  the fire department, and then they go there. 
[00:10:30]  That's your time now.  That's time you could be promoting your product.  And that's what we do.  Call it assault on media.  Listeners, fans of the show, or our own intern staff here goes behind the reporter, or sometimes  in front of them, anywhere in front of the camera, and kind of plugs the program.  That's the assault on media.  You just don't touch the reporter.  No.  And sometimes it goes very well.  Yeah.  Sometimes it goes horribly wrong.  Yeah.  And sometimes, like today, some people get a little upset. 
[00:11:00]  The funny thing is, the listeners are supposed to be doing the assaults on the media.  Uh-huh.  Why is it that we're doing them?  Well, I think because we've been so lucky being in Midtown, there's a lot of live shots  that happen right around our area.  This is the second one this week alone.  Mm-hmm.  And just so everyone is on the same page, earlier in the week, Danny did an assault  on the media, and it was great.  Remember Danny running up to the reporter behind him with a, Danny had a cigarette in 
[00:11:30]  his mouth, holding a cup of coffee.  Just smiled.  Smiled and held up an open Anthony sign.  Yeah.  And that gave Danny the edge over Nathaniel in the intern race.  But.  But.  Danny, you're yesterday's news, man.  I'm sorry.  Dude, I so know, too.  I got the call from Steve.  I was on the train, and I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, God damn it, he's going to get  it.  Yep.  And sure enough, he did.  You are yesterday's news, my friend.  That's how fast it turns on the open Anthony program.  Nathaniel, do you want Danny sitting here during your appearance? 
[00:12:00]  I'm not exactly sure what we need him in here for, but then.  Your super producer, Hawk Bagel, said, go in there now.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Danny, recreate the experience of watching it on TV.  Oh, he's smashing you good.  Wow.  Nathaniel, take the rest of the morning off.  Actually, you can't, because Ben's MIA, so we need him.  Yeah, Ben is missing.  Yeah, Ben is MIA. 
[00:12:30]  Can't call him.  We can't get him on the phone or anything this morning.  And he hasn't called?  He's not here?  I heard he was out last night?  Well, Ben and I and Don, who's pretty much running the channel now, he's up in New York,  and we did a little business dinner.  No big deal, really.  And I guess Ben was pretty hammered at dinner, according to Don.  Really?  Had a few?  And then Don and Ben went out for another hour or so, and I went home. 
[00:13:00]  That's very rare.  And we haven't heard from Ben since, so uh-oh.  Can't get him on the phone.  Ben's never hammered at dinner.  Never.  He usually doesn't make it past lunch.  So, I don't know.  That's a developing story.  We're waiting for him to arrive.  Or call or something.  That would be nice.  Anyway, getting back to Nathaniel.  So, an assault on the media.  I was walking by the live shot this morning.  Oh, you did?  I was so late today, because I'm walking by the live shot, all excited, like,  guys, we have another opportunity, I'm thinking. 
[00:13:30]  And it was right on 57th?  It was right across from the garage there.  Right across from the garage?  Basically, yeah.  Is that one on the Carnegie Hall side?  Yeah.  The subway there.  All right.  I know where that is.  Sure.  And so, I'm walking past, and I'm ready to, you know, come into work all excited, like,  guys, we got another one that we can do.  Yeah.  But it was, I was way late to the party, man.  All of a sudden, they, you know, Nathaniel had the video all queued up and ready to go  to show everybody.  It is stunning.  It is fantastic.  Is the video up on opianthony.com yet? 
[00:14:00]  Well, I hope so.  They're working on it.  They're working on it?  Yeah.  You've got to see this one.  Anyway, sorry.  Let's go.  Thanks, Eric.  What happened?  Do you get that in your ear, too?  Sometimes when they talk to me.  What did he say?  Well, who said working on it?  You, right?  Yeah.  And then two seconds later, Eric has to tell me in my ear that they're working on it.  Yeah.  Hawk, what's the status?  Anyway.  He's looking up at the screen now.  I don't hear it.  I'm here.  I'm here.  La, la, la. 
[00:14:30]  He's at his happy place.  Anyway, Nathaniel, walk us through your brilliant assault on the media.  Well, I was in Pick a Bagel.  I was actually a little nervous because a man in a suit came in and I thought I was made  by the reporter.  Really?  But it was just some dude.  So, I'm just trying to act natural.  I see the, I'm in contact with Steve here, obviously, to get this shot.  So, Pick a Bagel is right across the street from where they're setting up.  So, you're just kind of making believe you're buying a bagel and waiting for your shot. 
[00:15:00]  You're laying low.  Yes.  Laying low.  The problem is, the signs are so big.  I know.  Very hard to hide.  Very hard.  It makes you a little suspicious.  But go ahead.  So, you're in Pick a Bagel.  And then I see the actual reporter come out and start looking pretty.  Crimping, waiting for his live shot to come on.  Yeah.  And so, I duck around the corner to the right side of the street and Steve says, he's live.  And I walk up, hopefully rather calmly, with my signs.  And let me tell you, that is the point where you go, uh-oh. 
[00:15:30]  Yep.  Because we're watching the video and you see Nathaniel barely in frame.  You can see him and he's holding the sign kind of down low.  And it's horrible because you just know what's coming.  What it reminded me of when I saw it, because you see the reporter and then you see in the  back, it's a little flash of Nathaniel walking.  And you know he's ready to walk in.  It reminded me of The Godfather when Brando looks up and just sees the two guys running  towards him with the pistols before they're shooting.  I just got a peek of him and I'm like, there's going to be a problem. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Here it comes.  He's holding something that looks long and flat.  I continue.  And so then I walk into frame and I start trying to, because I remember one of the, not  criticisms, but remarks about Danny's assault was there was no audio.  Right.  So I tried to say, Opie and Anthony, XM radio.  Doesn't turn out too good because of the mics they use or whatever.  Yeah.  But, you know, the cameraman was smiling.  He's like, no, just keep it down.  You know, you can stay in frame.  Just keep your voice down. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  He didn't seem pissed.  Wow.  Which is more than I could say for the reporter.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got to also talk about the listener.  Oh, yeah.  That came out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Where did he come from?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  I just, I'm in there.  Some guy starts walking up to me.  I'm like, uh-oh, they have bouncers now.  Yeah, because the guy was big.  It looked like he could have been a security guy.  So basically Nathaniel set up with his huge Opie and Anthony sign right behind the reporter's  head.  And then next thing you know, this guy comes into frame, and he's a listener, and he's  kind of hanging out with you, and then he starts giving the finger. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, he put his middle finger up.  Well, Nathaniel just stopped in the frame and held the sign up and just stood there with  the sign.  Yeah.  Like it was a perfectly natural place for him to be.  It was like one of Maury's wig commercials.  He's just standing there, and the reporter's going on, and you're just standing there with  your sign.  It was fantastic.  I couldn't believe you got that much camera time.  And then the listener, who was standing next to him, just starts flipping the bird to the  camera.  And then the listener just walks down into the subway.  Yeah.  Before the shot was even done. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, it was like it was planned.  Like he went his way, I went mine, and our work was done.  I think the rest should be explained with the actual audio.  All right.  Yeah, because then something happened right after the reporter was done with his stupid...  Reporters are never really happy about these things.  They just aren't.  And this is the audio from the air.  Yeah.  This is what went out over the air.  This isn't any kind of recorder that Nathaniel had on him.  No, right off the TV.  Right off the TV.  So what you're hearing went out over the air to the entire CBS television audience. 
[00:18:00]  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously  swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put  a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Oh!  Oh!  Wow.  Oh! 
[00:18:30]  How about waiting till the shot is cleared?  How about waiting till you're not on the air anymore before you say, what the fuck is  your problem?  You really have to see this video.  This video, I think, is going to get some play out there.  Yeah.  It's a good one.  This video is going to get some play on some of those fine websites.  Yeah, and so the reporter's done, and he turns around immediately to Nathaniel and  goes, what the fuck is your problem live on the air this morning?  Oh, Golden Buns from Whackbag is asking, did the reporter yell, if you want to get on 
[00:19:00]  camera, just ask?  So then, of course, they...  You pussy.  Then all of a sudden, you know, then they have to go back to the news desk, and this is what  they had to do.  They had to apologize to everybody.  Oh, yes, Nathaniel?  No, this is him coming back from his little tape segment.  Oh, okay.  All right, so they go to the tape segment, then they go back to the live reporter.  All right, gotcha.  Sorry about that distraction, Beaufort.  The transit committee is expected to pass this later on today. 
[00:19:30]  Sorry about that distraction, Beaufort.  Beaufort.  He is so flustered.  He's so frazzled.  Listen again.  Sorry about that distraction, Beaufort.  The transit committee is expected to pass this later on today.  Oh, they must have just handed him an asshole, though.  Beaufort.  Did you hear what you said?  That went out live.  Went out live, you idiot.  Beaufort.  Just watching some video of a guy getting...  Oh, wow. 
[00:20:00]  A guy getting creamed by an SUV during a...  After an accident.  Yeah, Minnesota State Trooper looks like.  That's the video of the day.  Was that the trooper getting hit, or was that...  Was the trooper getting hit?  Yeah, it was a trooper.  What's his condition?  It doesn't look good.  I don't know.  He must be alive if they're showing it.  Lambed.  Yeah, that's why they survived.  That's true.  Very good, Nathaniel.  Must be alive if they're showing it.  So anyway, you've got to see the video of this assault on the media.  Look at that.  Bam!  Oh, his head smacked on the hood. 
[00:20:30]  That is awful.  That's a rough one.  And, yeah, it's too bad that Mike also didn't pick up him asking why I have to be so fucking stupid.  Oh, really?  Oh, he said that too, huh?  Yep.  Yeah, you're so stupid.  Why do I have to be so fucking stupid?  No, I think you're actually pretty smart.  That's my job.  What I do here.  You're not the one dumb enough to curse on live TV.  True.  Yeah, I want to hear that again.  The video should be up on opianthony.com soon.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy a couple of multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously swipe people in all day. 
[00:21:00]  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about 16 million dollars a year, and they're trying to put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's...  That's just great.  After the whole Janet Jackson thing, he's cursing. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Very good, Nathaniel.  Thank you.  Not that Danny's wasn't great with the sign that said, Ope, Ant.  I like the way you got the whole sign in frame, though.  That was good.  Thank you.  Another successful assault on the media.  Opian Anthony, XM Radio, you could hear it.  I think it was a perfect one.  Yep.  Nathaniel, you performing tomorrow at the Comedy Cellar?  Oh, hey.  Hey, look at that.  Nathaniel gets a free port on the show. 
[00:22:00]  The other here.  Yes, I'm hosting the new talent show.  It starts at 7 o'clock, and I'll be there.  Your only show at the show is tomorrow night at 7.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Nice.  All right, there he goes, Nathaniel.  Beautiful job this morning.  Let's go to Jeremy in New Jersey.  Jeremy.  Hey, boys.  This one pales in comparison to that one, but last night on the Fox 5 10 o'clock news,  they were interviewing some of the costumed people outside Star Wars waiting to get in,  and someone stuck a wow sticker up right behind the reporter's head, and it stayed there 
[00:22:30]  for the entire interview.  Probably a good two minutes.  God, we haven't heard about that one yet.  Yeah, I wish I had the video, guys.  Sorry.  All right.  No worries.  Thank you.  Once that goes up, we've got to get the link to that video to FARC.com.  Yeah.  Then from FARC, it just goes everywhere.  Well, I'm sure Steve is on it already.  Make sure Steve is on that one.  Let's go to Jeff in Canada, listening to XM Satellite Radio, probably illegally.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jeff.  Of course I'm listening illegally.  That's the only way to go, guys. 
[00:23:00]  I was going to say, maybe Ben stopped and gave some homeboy directions last night.  Oh.  Listening to Christmas music.  Yo, little twitchy man, which way is north?  Oh, don't.  You've got to go up here.  I know the whole way.  You've got to make a turn.  Bam!  Ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Still no word from Ben.  Ben was just probably talking to some strange guy.  Damn, my preperno.  Oh, hey, preperno.  Here you go.  What's the point?  What?  I'm Brady.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  Speaking of Star Wars, Big Kev in studio.  Big Kev had his big event last night in New Jersey in Clifton.  Hi.  How many theaters were showing Star Wars last night at the Clifton Multiplex over there?  All 16.  All 16.  All 16 theaters showing Star Wars.  Oh.  3,300 people.  3,300 people.  A lot of costumes were there?  There were several costumes.  Sometimes I'm sure that Steve will be getting some pictures from people over there. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  And prize giveaways for trivia?  There was prize giveaways for trivia.  I did take some audio also that I guess Steve is patching together.  Fantastic.  What did you think of the movie?  The cool to crap ratio was much better this time around than the previous, but there is  some crap in it, so I've only heard great stuff.  It is a Star Wars movie.  Yeah.  So there's like kid stuff and cute little animals. 
[00:24:30]  No, not really cute little animals this time, but there was some comedic elements that...  Oh, those lame funny moments.  The kind of kid action in the film this time will jar you in the other direction.  Yeah.  Speaking of jar, any jar there?  A couple of walk-throughs, but that's about it.  He doesn't get killed?  No.  He had a great moment.  Do you know the theater would just go bullshit? 
[00:25:00]  It would explode.  It would explode if Jar Jar Binks got killed.  God, why didn't he do that?  What a fool.  But you got audio of who?  I went around and talked to some people online.  Now, the big story, though, is I hear Master Poe showed up.  Master Poe was in attendance.  Master Poe went to see the movie.  Yes.  Yes.  And I hear he was involved in a few lightsaber matches. 
[00:25:30]  I think Master Poe could not resist the opportunity to display his lightsaber skills in that environment.  Now, as we know, Master Poe is a great stick fighter.  He can grab a stick and kick some ass with it.  How, in your opinion, was his lightsaber prowess?  Um, well, I feared for the life of his opponent when it was just Master Poe on one person.  But then when it developed into Master Poe on two people, then it seemed like maybe, you know, Master Poe was kind of, uh... 
[00:26:00]  He was like, like, uh, uh, like, uh, Dark, uh...  Let me set the scene.  Was he taking on multiple people?  Let me set the scene.  It's the front of the theater.  Yeah.  There are 3,000 people around, and Master Poe is standing right dead center with a fan who had an O&A sign  who just stood up with the O&A sign the entire pre-show time, three or four hours before they were letting people in. 
[00:26:30]  And Master Poe, of course, there's people coming up, you know, Master Poe, and, you know, they'd like to meet him, and so on.  And, of course, and he's examining their weaponry, and so on and so forth.  And, uh, uh, I, I went away to do some interviews, and when I came back, I saw that Master Poe had, uh, started to engage in combat with one combatant.  And, uh, you know he's gonna take it more seriously than these geeks.  Oh, of course. 
[00:27:00]  Like, these geeks are used to just facing off with each other, and clinking their lightsabers together, and there's Poe spinning around, like, knocking him in the head.  Exactly. And when, and when Poe is deflecting his, uh, opponent into other people, you're really getting a great laugh out of it.  Oh, wow.  And what makes it even more funny is when Poe is deflecting two people into other people.  Really?  Yeah. So guys are getting smacked all over the place.  What was he like? Force-throwing them into people? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, well, I don't know, using some of his Poe powers, I don't know.  Poe powers? They're flying off into the crowd?  Yeah, it was, it was a sight.  Wow. And, and now I'm hearing, there's video of this.  Yeah, yeah, a couple of people, uh, came up to me and said, uh, we got it on video, we took pictures and so on, and I said, send it to Steve, send it to Steve.  They have been instructed, and they've been given the address to send it to Steve, and we will have that.  So I presume somebody will be sending something to Steve.  Oh, I gotta see that video.  Because, because, because, I cannot wait until people get a hold of it and actually put in the lightsaber, things, you know, people got the software, I got, I got some of that software at home myself, I'd like to maybe enhance the clip, I think it would be a little funny to put some blaster shots in, and some lightsaber action. 
[00:28:00]  Here comes Master Poe.  Oh, here he is.  What's up, guys?  Master Poe, uh, we were just talking about your, uh, engaging in a little, little combat at the Star Wars, uh, premiere last night. 
[00:28:30]  Well, I, I couldn't help it.  These guys were, were out there, and they were striking each other in the head and, and, and the legs, and it looked like fun.  Yeah.  What type of lightsaber was it, uh, Kev?  Was it those real nice ones?  No, or, uh, well, some of the people had those, but those weren't the ones generally being used, right?  It was the, uh, the, the cheaper, the $20 Kenner kind of.  The ones you could bash together a little bit more.  Now, uh, Paul, you're, you're quite the, uh, combatant with the, with the stick. 
[00:29:00]  Like, you could take a walking stick and pretty much, like, movie-style kick ass on people.  Uh, yeah, you won't be able to see how many strikes.  Right.  So now, were you using some of these moves with the lightsaber on some of these Star Wars geeks?  I was, but I wasn't hurting them.  As far as you know, these geeks can't take anything.  Like, ow!  You're not supposed to hit so hard!  With respect to Master Poe, they were bedazzled.  They had no idea what was going on. 
[00:29:30]  Poe hit him eight, nine times, but they were just like, other people are hit, looking around to see who else is hitting them.  Poe would, like, smack him five times and they did, like, what are you doing to me?  They'd be all freaked out.  And Poe would start that thing that he does where he's just moving it around himself, and they would just be like, wow.  They would just back off.  Just back off.  He should have had his Sith costume on.  They had a lot of spirit.  Anthony, they had a lot of spirit.  They had a lot of spirit.  Yeah, that force.  They showed spirit.  The force.  That doesn't mean shit when you wake up in a hospital bed. 
[00:30:00]  With Christmas music playing.  Exactly what I was thinking.  I was at the Star Wars movie.  I was having a lightsaber fight.  Next thing I know, I'm hearing Christmas songs.  Why is there a Christmas tree in my room?  The news is showing one of the lines to one of the...  Oh, and a lightsaber fight.  See, they don't do it right, though.  Look, it's all slow motion.  They're all doing it too slow, Poe, right?  You've got to get in there.  Yeah, pretty much.  With some action.  Was there any worthy opponents that you met last night, or were you just kicking ass 
[00:30:30]  on everybody?  They were beginners.  Poe took on a geek with dreads, these green dreads, and this awful outfit, and who claimed  to be like this master fencer kind of guy.  This was one of Poe's single opponents, and they are going through the parking lot, their  security trucks are pulling up, and looking, going, oh, it's just, little did they know, 
[00:31:00]  they're going in the parking lot, there's people walking by, and getting smacked.  So the whole battle, like in a movie, would move on to different settings?  What he said, he says, I'm quite the fencer, and I've been fencing for many years.  And I said, oh, really?  And I said, well, would you like to go a little bit?  He says, yeah, sure.  And he stuck his chest out and everything.  I said, oh, okay.  We had a lot of fun.  You dispatched him?  Yeah, but he didn't get hurt.  No.  I just hit him in the hand a couple of times.  A couple of people around that fight got smacked real good. 
[00:31:30]  Really got a little bit.  The bystanders might have a little problem.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  I guess he was there.  Nate, what's up?  Yeah, good morning, guys.  I was there last night when Poe was kicking ass.  And he started beating up my friend Jim, so he was screaming, leave him alone.  What a jerk.  I love the callbacks from Jimmy's pussy story yesterday.  He was in the hood.  Oh, bravo, buddy.  Leave him alone. 
[00:32:00]  Goddamn, is that funny?  Anthony, a bunch of people begging us to post the video because they want to enhance it.  Oh, how much fun will it be now to get the video and actually put him in a Star Wars setting, perhaps?  Put the lightsabers on the actual lightsabers?  The effects when they hit together?  Music?  That'll be up in a few days.  I can't wait.  Yeah, definitely.  Did you see the movie, Master Poe?  Oh, absolutely.  And?  I loved it.  Yeah?  I loved it.  Really good?  It was, it was, it was, it brought the entire, it brought all the movies together. 
[00:32:30]  That's what its job is.  And I, it was just amazing how Darth Vader became Darth Vader and obviously he was Anakin.  Um, and, and just the, the, the war between the Sith and, and the Force, it was pretty powerful.  I can't believe you ruined the movie, Poe.  By giving away the ending like that.  I just said the Sith and the Force.  Anakin is Darth Vader?  Yeah.  Uh, oh, well, everyone in the world will hate me now.  Let's go to Vic in Ohio.  Hey, it was a great movie. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Vic, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Trying to, uh, stay awake.  I went and saw it last night and, Anthony, I gotta tell you, man, this is another Bull Durham.  It's a fucking chick flick with a bunch of science fiction bullshit thrown around it.  Well, now, I, I heard about the, you know, the, the love story thing, but from everything  I read, they, they don't, they don't dwell on it too long at any given time.  Like, it's, it's there, but the scenes are quick and painless, and, and they get right  back to action.  A lot of action, though, right? 
[00:33:30]  A lot of action.  Yes.  Yeah, there you go.  I don't know.  I just, oh, I'm pregnant.  No, shut up.  He didn't wait long enough to try and kill her.  All right.  Thank you, Vic.  Thank you, sir.  All right, fellas.  He, uh, he didn't like it.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  A lot of action.  I, I can't wait to see.  I can't wait to listen to some of Big Cab's interviews.  Yeah, absolutely.  From the Star Wars premiere.  And, of course, the video.  I need that video, people.  Yeah.  You were videotaping that.  You've got to send it to Steve.  All right.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you very much.  We're going to take our first break.  We've got lots to do today.  When we get back, we've got to play the Bill's Dead call in Spanish.  All right.  That's all done?  Yeah, it's done and ready to go.  Yeah, we were doing that yesterday, laughing our asses off.  If you weren't listening yesterday, we'll explain.  Also, Rich Voss and Dave Mordal coming in today in studio.  And I hold in my hand.  Where is it?  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Anthony and I's first show together.  Oh.  First show together.  What's the date on it?  This is like 10 years ago, bro. 
[00:34:30]  90.  10 years ago.  Is it 94 or 95?  Ooh.  Yeah, like 90.  I think it's fall of 94.  Yeah.  So it's a little over 10 years, 10 and a half years.  Oh, it's just awful.  Anthony and I listened to the first 20 seconds.  I had to hit stop on the CD player.  It's so uncomfortable.  I am just a blithering, happy-to-be-there idiot.  And Opie is just a textbook rock jock.  I'm a radio ass.  Like, he's got to do all the things.  He's got to make everything sound great on the air. 
[00:35:00]  And it's just so embarrassing.  I'll just give you a teaser.  I'll stop at exactly where Anthony and I stopped it.  Couldn't take it.  So just picture it.  It's before Ecstasy of Gold's playing.  Anthony and I.  Well, Jimmy was in here, too.  And I told the guys, we got this.  And we wanted to give it a little listen.  We had like four minutes to kill.  It took 20 seconds for us to hit stop.  And this is going to be so painful.  Song's ending. 
[00:35:30]  Song's got to end.  Here comes your favorite radio DJ, everybody.  A lot of music was being played.  It was tuning up in the background.  Long Island's best ride WBAB, Soul Asylum.  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from R.E.M.  What's the frequency?  Oh, you.  Oh, God, I can't.  I'm not going to be able to sit in this fucking studio.  I actually am not familiar with that Soul Asylum.  Soul Asylum.  That was so smooth back then.  I'll say. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wait until I kick in.  Ugh.  Oh, that's all we can listen to.  That's exactly where we stopped at.  That wasn't that bad, though.  Dad, laugh at everything.  Ugh.  So horrid.  When is Rich Voss going to be here?  I haven't talked to him.  I'm not sure.  We're all claymation handses.  All right.  See you some picture in the Daily News today.  Where?  Voss.  They're advertising.  Yeah, he's going to be at Caroline's every weekend.  So they have his picture in the paper.  Yeah.  So.  Real slow news day.  Well, this is a big part of the show today, so these guys got to show up. 
[00:36:30]  We want to get it going immediately.  I have faith in Rich.  All right.  Anyway.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  No sign of Ben still?  Can't get him on the phone.  Nothing.  Uh-oh.  He's all right.  All right.  Yeah, I guess that's it for now.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Voss, former pop star, Boy George, 43. 
[00:37:00]  Doesn't look it.  Am I right or wrong?  Won't let go of his claim that Bush singer Gavin Rosedale is hiding an 80s fling  with drag queen Marilyn.  Ugh, what a tattletale.  This is George.  When I was writing my memoir called Take It Like a Man.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  This memoir is called Take It Like a Man.  You might as well have written that in disappearing ink.  Take It Like a Man. 
[00:37:30]  Bush were well on their way to rock stardom, and he appeared in my house to persuade me  not to include him in Marilyn.  Oh, Rosedale wrote in his new book.  What?  Uh-oh.  No, he just fucked his way up.  I kind of screwed something up there, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  You didn't proofread, did you?  You didn't proofread.  You didn't highlight.  No, they fucked up.  They did.  They did.  Yeah, by putting that in the fucking magazine.  Oh, wait.  Rosedale wrote his new book.  Oh.  Rosedale.  Oh, no.  It is written in English.  Oh, that's the Bush guy.  No, it's wrong. 
[00:38:00]  Is it?  Big Mouth, former pop star, Boy George, won't let go of his claim that Bush singer Gavin Rosedale  is hiding in 80s playing with drag, Killeen, Marilyn.  Period.  You got that part, okay.  When I was writing my memoir, Bush were well on their way to rock stardom, and he appeared  at my house to persuade me not to include him in Marilyn, Rosedale wrote in his new book.  What the fuck is that?  So they're saying that Boy George is claiming something about Rosedale, but then Rosedale  showed up at his house and said, please don't let me include this in my book? 
[00:38:30]  That doesn't make any sense.  That does not make any sense.  It certainly doesn't.  I think those guys are all hooked on glycerine.  You are vindicated, Jim.  I don't think, and this is Rosedale wrote his new book, I don't think Marilyn has ever  really gotten over Gavin.  So apparently Gavin Rosedale is writing in the third person.  Either he's a sociopath, or Terry Schiavo typed this.  I don't think Marilyn really got over Gavin, Rosedale reportedly said after the first book.  George thinks everyone is gay, but who'd take, what's his take on the rumor's return? 
[00:39:00]  It's old news, as Rep tells us.  Yuck.  So you knew Boy George's real name before you read that.  That's not even in there.  I know, you're right.  Yeah, you did.  No, I did.  Thank you for pointing that out.  I didn't even realize.  You just knew his name.  How long have you known that?  I don't know.  I just learned it early on.  It was on the big poster he had on his wall.  Yeah.  I mean, after I'll come before you, you have to read all you can.  That was actually a good one.  I prefer Carmen Chameleon. 
[00:39:30]  It's not Carmen Chameleon.  It's Carmen Chameleon.  I thought it was Carmen.  No.  Carmen Chameleon.  I always thought he had a pet chameleon named Carmen.  I'd be proud that I didn't know that.  A little Spanish chameleon just tacked and stole from the other reptiles.  Where in the world is Carmen Chameleon?  Go in the tunnel, Carmen.  Go in the tunnel.  What's the matter?  I don't know.  Ooh.  Here we go.  Whatever was wrong, it's right now.  Oh, you feel all about the juice.  You're going to get all mad at his carrot juice. 
[00:40:00]  Now he's just smiled.  There's something wrong with my carrot juice.  Eric, remember this.  When Jimmy's getting ready to get really mad, we'll break out Carmen Chameleon.  And he'll start to dance and wiggle his head like that.  Make sure you fill us in at the exact moment that load hit you in the face during this song.  That's the money shot.  That moment already passed.  It's right at the beginning.  That's wonderful.  Do you move real fast at this part coming up? 
[00:40:30]  Here it comes.  Now you're bopping back and forth.  You tickle the bag here and then sort of...  Huddle up, huddle up.  I like your tickling bag.  You tickle the bag.  Very good.  Oh, God, the 80s suck.  Herbie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  It's on.  The man's making it all.  Leary, Leary, Needs of the head, Needs of the drawing. 
[00:41:00]  Himmic, her, himmic, her, himmic, her, himmic, her.  Well, then what's that?  Yeah.  Which?  What?  Why?  Where?  Sure.  Why?  Why?  Who?  Well, why?  We have problems.  We and the need.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  I realize the mind.  I am eating up for my mind.  You are checking out the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know what's going on outside the studio, but...  Steve's going to come in here in a second.  Martini Steve's back from jury duty. 
[00:42:00]  Is this the Foo Fighters song?  No, this was Queens of the Stone Age.  Oh, this is with the guy from the Foo Fighters.  Yeah, Dave Grohl on the drums.  Trying to get Steve in here.  I guess the latest assault on the media that happened this morning with Nathaniel is now up on opianthony.com.  Oh, it is.  And foundrymusic.com.  Enjoy.  And it looks like it's going to be on farc.com soon.  This video is going to have some play because the reporter kind of lost it at the end there and cursed on live TV. 
[00:42:30]  Use the F word.  The F word.  One of the biggies.  Yeah.  The number two word.  I don't know.  Should we report them to the FCC?  It is the company we used to work for.  It is.  God, that is funny.  I should report them.  I was highly offended this morning when a reporter, acting very unprofessionally.  It's all up.  Yep.  First of all, any word from Ben? 
[00:43:00]  No.  I've been trying to call him.  It gets dumped right into his voicemail every time I call him.  What the hell?  It's getting late now.  I don't know.  Maybe he's crashed out.  Maybe he's not feeling well.  It's our little Ben.  Poor Ben.  He's probably naked, like on top of his comforter with his arms and little legs splayed out.  Oh, huge mule.  Yeah.  Like a little baby that just fell over.  He can't get up because he's rocking on his hug.  Like a lamb.  Our listeners are a bunch of wise asses. 
[00:43:30]  You've got to see this one.  Bill in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Bill.  Hey, I just kind of want to find out about Steve being gone.  If he was on the jury selection process for the prosecution and his flame gear for an arson case.  Was it arson?  Actually on the flaming clothing?  That would be fun.  Tried as I might to look obnoxious and stupid and get myself out of jury duty with an obscene look.  It just didn't work.  I was there all day.  It's just an agonizing process.  I walked in there with a...  Yeah, but some people have to go more than one day. 
[00:44:00]  You're lucky.  Oh, yeah.  I was lucky last summer, too.  You spend one day there.  It's boring as hell.  They have you in a huge room with 300 people, and they call names every once in a while,  and you go into a little classroom setting, and the lawyers are up there in front of the room,  and then you have to kind of jockey for position and try to figure out how you're going to get out of that particular case.  Then they throw you out of that case, send you back to the big pool, and now you're on the end of the list  because they still have to call everyone else in that room.  So if you get thrown back into the main room, you're golden, but you still have to spend the whole day there. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And then you're free for three years.  Yeah, and then you're free for three years.  But the whole time, I just...  It's very obvious when you walk in there that nobody wants to be there.  It's your civic responsibility.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, it's hilarious, though.  I mean, you're in the big room, right?  And you just listen to everyone and having conversations, how they're going to try to get out of the jury duty.  Yeah.  That's all it's about.  Yeah.  I'm going to try this.  What do you think?  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to say that I'm a teacher.  I'm going on vacation.  You know, all sorts of stuff. 
[00:45:00]  It's great.  Yeah.  They practice their lines on each other.  And when it comes down to it, it doesn't matter what you say to the people in the small room  because if you give them any doubt that you just don't want to be on the case, they don't want you.  No, they'll throw you off.  Right.  What happened, Steve?  Did you get off?  Yeah, well, I got put in a big room with a bunch of other people, and it was an attempted murder case.  So, yeah, it was actually interesting watching it happen.  And, of course, just as they get done telling everybody that they should turn off their cell phones, of course,  I take it for granted that mine's off.  As he's reading the list of what this guy did a couple years ago, my cell phone goes off as loud as possible. 
[00:45:30]  And it's Danny calling, you know, trying to get an update.  You should have reprogrammed your cell phone so it's some obnoxious ring.  Well, it's already loud as hell.  So I get the evil eye from the judge, you know, right off the bat, you know, like I'm some pain in the ass.  Did you apologize?  No.  I just, yeah, I did get called up to see the judge, though, because they have you fill out a list of questions,  like a two-page long questionnaire. 
[00:46:00]  And judging from the questions that were on this thing, there was something involving a cop or something like that  because every other question was, do you know anybody in law enforcement?  How do you feel about law enforcement?  Have you ever been convicted of a crime?  Oh, boy.  And so I get called up to the judge because obviously I'm putting down, yes, I know police officers, yes, I know this.  And he pulls me aside.  And he says, so what's going on?  Who do you know?  I'm like, so I had to tell, not specifically, but just that I knew a bunch of people in law enforcement.  And I said, so that might actually affect your ability to render a fair judgment. 
[00:46:30]  I was like, oh, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  And I tried to avoid, you know, mentioning where I worked and stuff like that just because you don't, you know,  you never know how people are going to react, but ultimately jostled that out of me.  Oh, really?  And, yeah, he said, so is there anything else that might affect you?  I was like, you know, I kind of travel a lot, so I don't really want to be here for three weeks on this if I can possibly avoid it.  He goes, really, what do you do?  I'm a producer for a talk radio show.  Really?  Where?  XM.  Really?  What show?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:47:00]  Here it comes.  And so I told him, I said, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  And they just eyes rolled back on the judge and the two lawyers.  Oh, those idiots.  Yeah.  Oh, those idiots.  All right.  You're out of here.  What traveling do you do, by the way?  What?  I said, I'm going to D.C. next week, so I said, I don't really want to be here for two weeks.  Traveling.  They were going down there for a couple shows.  Did you wear an obnoxious T-shirt?  Yes, I did.  I wore as obnoxious as I possibly could.  I wore a big, one of those Andy Gore shirts with a big circus lettering that says freak on the front. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, God.  I had my sleeves rolled up, so my tattoos were hanging out.  In court.  Yeah, in court.  I really just didn't want to be there.  But you know what?  I wasn't the weirdest person there.  There was a big Rastafarian guy with pot leaf medallions all over him, and he was in there.  He's probably a lawyer.  He just didn't want to do it.  Or a banker somewhere.  It comes down to this.  The people that really want to be on these cases just aren't responsible enough to make these decisions.  Rick.  I'm sorry.  What happened?  I love Ricky, but I wanted yogurt. 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  I swear to God, I asked him for yogurt.  No, stop it.  What did he bring you?  Um, it looks like...  What is it?  Why are we...  What is it?  Fossilized yogurt.  What?  It's a muffin.  It's a muffin.  I just want people to know we are not replaying the audio from yesterday.  Yeah, no, this is a replay from yesterday.  You got a blueberry muffin there.  Because when, when, uh, when, when Travis went to, uh...  Are you doing this on purpose just to get air time? 
[00:48:30]  You amaze us.  When, when Travis went to, uh, get breakfast this morning, he came back and said there was  no low-fat blueberry yogurt, which I have pretty much every day.  Yeah.  So when, when Rick went to Starbucks again, I'm like, uh, because they have yogurt at Starbucks.  Yeah.  I'm like, uh, see if you can get me a blueberry yogurt and see if they have low-fat.  And that, I guess you heard blueberry muffin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Is this a low-fat one?  Yeah.  Priceless, man.  Want me to, uh, change that?  Never disappoint. 
[00:49:00]  Don't wreck that food, because I'll eat that one.  I'm not going to wreck it.  I'm not going to wreck it.  All right.  Because you, you get mad and then you, you break stuff that other people would like to  eat.  I'll have a bite of it.  Wow.  I'd like some yogurt.  All right.  Cut it in half.  I'll have half.  All right.  All right.  Well, go get his yogurt, Rick.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Low, low-fat.  And it's, yogurt is, it's more of a liquid form of food.  Yeah.  Make sure you have a name tag with a phone number that someone could call if you forget  where you are or, or you forget your name or something.  Yeah.  And don't touch this spoon.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  No touching this spoon.  Anyway, uh, back to Martini Steve.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:30]  God.  Dude.  I don't even know what to say anymore.  He's got to be retarded.  I was, I was the one that wrote them hard in the beginning, and I got a lot of shitty  emails from people, like, leave them alone.  I don't even say anything anymore.  You've got emails from who?  I didn't even guess.  Message boards that I now don't read anymore.  All I know is this.  When somebody needs service, and somebody's there to provide a service, I'd like that service  provided.  Right.  Anyway.  That's the way it should be.  I am stupefied. 
[00:50:00]  He's retarded.  I think you might be right.  There's a brain dump at some point that happens.  He absorbs the information, stays there for maybe five seconds, and it leaves.  It purges.  Yeah.  It goes beyond just being, uh, slow.  I, I, I, yeah.  All right.  You wanted yogurt, and you got a muffin.  God bless him.  All right, Steve.  Oh, yeah, speaking of which, we're going to do that in a few seconds here.  Steve, so anything else about jury duty?  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Um, it just, it's just really obvious that nobody wants to be there, and it's an agonizing 
[00:50:30]  experience.  And if you're not narcoleptic walking into it, you will be leaving, because it's just,  you have nothing to do other than sit there, Stu, and think of all the work you're not  getting done.  Why'd you listen to your iPod or something?  I did.  Okay.  I do.  But it's just the environment, though.  You can bring books, magazines.  You can bring your iPod.  You can do whatever.  But it's something about the room, just staring at everyone really bored, uh, uptight, and  tired, and it just, it just brings you down. 
[00:51:00]  And the excuses that people come up with, I mean, I was, I was trying to formulate something,  but the excuses that people come up with to get out of jury duty, uh, yes, Judge, I have,  I have a hard time, uh, concentrating.  Um, yes, Judge, I nod off easily.  And I shit you not, these were the excuses that they were coming up with.  And these guys have heard every, every single excuse in the book.  All right.  Let's try to call Ben again.  And that video's up, by the way.  Yeah?  Oh, the assault on the media that Nathaniel did, where the reporter curses at the end  of it, is now up on opianthony.com. 
[00:51:30]  This, uh, I think this video's gonna get a little play.  You know, the assault on the media was great with the opianthony sign, uh, sign, and, uh,  but then there's a listener that showed up and gave the finger, and then the reporter  turning around and just cursing, you know, going to Nathaniel, what the fuck is your  problem?  This is, uh, this is a great piece of video.  So, it's up on opianthony.com.  You're gonna get it to FARC, too, right?  Yeah, I gotta call Drew right now.  All right, right on.  There you go.  No answer with Ben?  No.  Can't get a hold of Ben.  All right, it's almost 8 o'clock, and still, uh, no word from Ben, the executive. 
[00:52:00]  I'm very worried about our little guy.  The executive producer of the O.P. and Anthony show.  I figured he would call, like, within, you know, within the hour we started.  It's, it's kind of, is he passed out somewhere in his, in his apartment?  Vomit?  Vomit on his bed?  Where does he live?  Somebody, like, run down there.  Hit him with a stick.  Uh, yeah, we should go down there with a cell phone.  That's not a bad idea, actually. 
[00:52:30]  Knock the door in.  Huh?  Who wants to do it?  Do we have, uh, enough people today?  Ricky.  No, we're not sending Ricky.  Yeah.  We'll go to Harlem.  You'll be on 150th Street.  Ben?  He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he was Ben Stewart because it's Ben Sherman's?  I just wanted to get some pink.  All right, well.  Roll sticks and rocks at him.  We'll figure it out.  Leave him alone.  Anyway, let's get the Bill's Dead thing out of the way again.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Now, uh, to explain, we were talking about the mayor of New York City yesterday.  He's making commercials for, for Hispanics.  He wants to win another term as mayor.  He's got a shitload of money.  I mean, the guy's a billionaire.  So he can spend it.  And he can spend it like other candidates can't.  He could go for the niche advertising of himself.  You know, it costs a lot to make a commercial.  And to make one in Spanish that just, you know, exclusively for Spanish people,  that might not be good for somebody on a limited budget. 
[00:53:30]  You want to cover as much ground as you can.  But Bloomberg can just, it doesn't matter.  He can speak Yiddish to get to the Hasidics.  You know, he's one of those guys who can spend all that money.  And that's what he did.  And he did one completely in Spanish.  And it sounded like he didn't really know how to speak the language.  Of course he didn't.  He just read it phonetically.  He read it phonetically.  So Anthony and I came up with a cute little idea, a quick idea,  that maybe we should translate some of our better bits into Spanish for the...  Maybe we'll get some Spanish listeners that way.  For the Spanish-speaking audience. 
[00:54:00]  Imagine they're just tuning around the dial XM,  and they hear all of a sudden some Spanish coming out.  They go, oh, what's this?  I think XM is launching a Spanish station, or a couple of them, or something like that.  So maybe we could, you know, give this bit to the Spanish station on XM.  And they could play it a few times.  So the only way this is going to make sense is to play the Bill's Dead phone call again.  I know it's kind of overplayed, but it is one of our favorites.  So it's basically this old lady called one of the old stations we worked at. 
[00:54:30]  Wrong number.  Wrong number, and we messed with her a little bit by telling her her dear friend Bill was dead.  A little bit.  So we're going to play the original, and then we'll come back for a quick second,  and we'll play the Spanish version.  All right.  All right.  But first year is the original.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him. 
[00:55:30]  I know.  Where did it happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:56:00]  So there's the original Bill's Dead call.  Uh-huh.  Now, here's that same bit in Spanish.  Yeah.  Hey, it's making us chuckle today.  Listen for Who Is Is This?  Listen for our awful Spanish.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Bill's dead in Spanish.  Hola.  Hola.  Hola.  Guillermo.  ¿Quién es esto?  Patricio.  Patricio, ¿cómo estás?  No estoy hablando con el que llamo equivocando. 
[00:56:30]  Ah, pues, Patricio, yo tengo malas noticias.  ¿Qué?  Ah, Guillermo se murió hoy.  Estoy llamando.  Ay, Dios mío.  Sí, qué tragedia.  ¿Quién es esto?  Él estuvo en un accidente de codo.  Ay, no. 
[00:57:00]  ¿Quién es esto?  Esto es Juan.  Juan?  Sí.  Ave María.  Dios mío, yo no lo creo.  Sí.  Pedro, yo estaba hablando con él no hace mucho.  Yo sé.  ¿Cuándo peso esto?  Esta tarde. 
[00:57:30]  ¿A dónde?  En la carretera.  Ay, que Dios lo quiera.  Sí.  Grande, grande, OK.  ¿Por qué?  Pues, esta seguro que la de los hijos al paciente.  Pues, me tengo que ir.  Está bien, Juan. 
[00:58:00]  Está bien.  Gracias.  Hasta luego.  Hasta luego.  There you have to.  There you have to.  It's been making us laugh for the last day.  Of course, the last day.  It's so stupid.  You can pick up on a few of the classic lines.  Donde.  Just to know it.  Donde.  Donde. 
[00:58:30]  The bit's twice as long because we have to try to do it in Spanish.  I know.  Our awful Spanish.  Accidento.  Donde.  Donde.  Donde.  Donde.  Are you French?  Well, I took a little French, too, in high school, so I got it all mixed up, I guess.  Rubbed off a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Well, there you have that.  Going to take another break, I guess.  Where's Rich Voss?  We want to get the first show going here.  No show.  Everyone's a no show today. 
[00:59:00]  Rich.  Ben.  Our own producer, Ben Sparks.  I hope he's not having another bout with the old gravy leg.  I hope right now he's laying on his bed and just out of both ends, I hope he looks like  the letter S because it's just shooting out of both ends.  It's not like him not to call, though.  I know.  Even when he was sick last time, he did call.  Mm-hmm.  This definitely isn't like him.  We sending an intern over there?  Are we? 
[00:59:30]  Danny's going to go over there?  Yeah, we'll try to wake him up, see what's going on with good old Ben.  Darren, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, you guys got to send this to the Mad Mexican.  That's not a bad idea.  You got to do it.  I would love to hear his reaction, his take on that.  That would be classic.  I'm sure there's words that are mispronounced that mean something else now in there.  All sorts of stuff.  Yeah, you guys don't exactly have Steve C. Dixon in your Spanish, but you did all right.  What we're going to do is we're going to be in Washington next week for a couple shows, 
[01:00:00]  so we'll give it to the Mad Mexican.  Sweet.  All right, man.  Viva los Pichis.  Punching out.  All right, let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Anthony, you're very talented of all the voices that you do, but I was more surprised  by this little old lady in Spanish.  I've been listening to her for so long.  Yeah, we've heard that business so many times that we got the reflections down pretty easily  there.  It was.  It was too late.  Oh, wow.  I saved myself.  I saved myself.  Thank God, because I had spun around to the mic looking at Jimmy. 
[01:00:30]  You want to feel this, Jim?  I almost banged my nose leading in.  And the mic.  Wow.  All right, guys.  Punch out.  You saved yourself.  Oh, man.  That was a kick save.  Kick save across the crease.  Thank God.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll regroup.  Yeah, you want to go to break with Ben Sparks' Herky Jerky from Slim Shitty?  What?  Nathaniel said one moment.  We got it here.  Yeah, let's play it from here. 
[01:01:00]  Go.  Herk Jerk.  Herk Jerk.  Herk Jerk.  Ben Sparks is Herky Jerky.  Wave his arms around like he's Herky Jerky.  Compulsing on the ground because he's Herky Jerky.  You know that he don't give a fuck.  He's Herky Jerky.  Don't mistake him for a bum.  ODing on some drugs.  He's moving all around because Ben Sparks is what he does.  He's into gossiping because he needs to know the buzz.  And giggling like a girl motherfucker just because.  He's a man about town, part of parties on the street. 
[01:01:30]  Unless he's had some crazy insane sushi to eat.  Then here comes Gravy Leg.  Better move out the way.  He'll be going through a pound of toilet paper in a day.  And looking at his hair is going to make you stop and think.  Did he wipe it on the floor after someone spilled a drink?  If you watch how he moves, you'll be cooking.  He's smoking a crack.  Herky Jerky on the phone.  Smaller than a Tic Tac in studio.  He'll be yawning during O&A shows.  Because all night he's been chatting about Tom Brady doing flow.  Back in Boston and drunk.  So tell you, Ben's we can fix her.  Because Ben heard Kurt Schilling had sex with his sister. 
[01:02:00]  Ben's mule is scary, man.  He's got Superman chucks.  He's changing looking mean like a cancerous lump.  Now Ben is rave.  Yelling at Jim, yelling at O.  Dude, relax.  Just concentrate on doing a fucking show.  That's crazy insane.  It's crazy, it's crazy insane.  It's not so, dude.  Did I tell you about Tom Brady?  Don't blow off this bitch's back.  It was fucking great.  We're all in a fucking club.  Drinking fucking kawashi.  Dude, dude, do you like my new hairstyle?  It's called the Hurricaniac.  Opiole.  I was just fucking yawning.  I didn't have any sleep.  I was out looking at Bono under the fucking bridge.  It was fucking crazy insane.  It's not crazy insane.  It's not everybody.  Anyway, so I walked in.  I was like, oh, no.  And I'm like, I had one black person.  I was like, oh, there's no music.  There's like some cheese laid out. 
[01:02:30]  It's like my friend's talking.  Okay, rockin' there.  And it's like, I start cranking up his show a little bit.  Whoa, there's a baby that lives downstairs.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day virus.  Where's Gary Holley?  And the CD player.  No, when are we going to get him in studio?  We're going to get him before Christmas, hopefully?  Ben is actually working on that right now.  Where are you guys booking him for Groundhog Day?  What's Ben working?  I don't see Ben doing a whole lot of anything except eating cereal and herky and jerky all  in the studio.  Herky and jerky.  I'm taking calls on his tiny little cell phone. 
[01:03:00]  His little tiny cell phone.  That chiclet cell phone.  If somebody walks in too fast, he can just eat his phone.  Ben's phone stinks.  The phone's like, dude, hey.  He's always gossiping about something.  Dude, Pedro does coke.  What?  My friend Tim from Boston knows what he is.  It's always some drivel he heard from some drunken mick at a party.  And Dad, I'm like, yeah, Bonhoeffer, you too, is coming.  I think he's like, that's horse shit.  Dude, I combed my hair with a car bomb. 
[01:03:30]  You forgot that.  That's insane.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  He just giggles about nothing.  I'm like, Ben, I've got to get this done.  Giggling, idiot.  He was laughing when you guys were talking serious about the death penalty.  Did anyone else catch it?  Yeah, it's like, dude, there's just too many poor people.  Here he comes. 
[01:04:00]  Here he comes.  Who doesn't love Ben?  I like the parody of Ben better than Ben now.  I thought someone got one of their teeth knocked out.  It was Ben's phone.  Your phone needs a filling.  I love the fact that he's always gossiping.  Always gossiping about somebody who has something to do with Boston.  Jim Rice is from Western Children.  What?  Easy.  Oh, man. 
[01:04:30]  Guys, yeah, that's fun.  Let me see your phone, Ben.  Got it on you?  Or did you lose it?  Look at this.  Look how little that is.  Wow.  Tell me some small phones.  That stinks anyway.  It doesn't work that well.  That one.  It's a tiny little phone.  That Ben parody is hilarious.  I wish people could see it and they just, you got to know Ben.  No, they get it. 
[01:05:00]  You just got to know Ben.  He's so herky.  He's always moving around.  He's so jerky.  And he just always laughs in the wrong places.  Yeah.  When you're like being serious.  Like, dude, look, I'm running late.  Look, here's some gossip.  Yeah, there's some gossip.  It's like a market.  It's like guns.  What?  Always gossiping.  Always a little gossip.  Wow.  Because he does.  He knows everyone in Boston. 
[01:05:30]  Everyone.  Any bit of news that comes out of Boston.  He knows everything about Boston.  Everything that the common folk read about in Boston, he will know like ten layers deep  into the story.  Dude, I was trying to hang out with Tom Brady.  What?  What happened with Tom Brady?  Probably some scandal that never materializes.  He was with ten broads or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that was the Tom Brady gossip.  Yes, I got that call.  Dude, I was with the crafts at the new stadium.  There's a body buried in the basement.  It's insane.  I swear.  What? 
[01:06:00]  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  I would have called you, but my phone was in my ear.  I couldn't get it out.  So I got a toothpick.  I got my phone stuck between my teeth.  I got to pick it out, dude.  This phone makes me physically ill.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I got to pick it out, dude. 
[01:06:30]  I got to pick it out, dude.  All right, here's the deal.  We're patiently waiting for Rich Vos to show up with Dave Mordal.  We wanted to go over the first radio show that Anthony and I ever did. 
[01:07:00]  I think it's more fun when there's other guys around here to smash us.  Smash us.  We'll get smashed good today.  Funny story in the paper.  Fun fiasco is tarnishing golden years.  Ah, really good story.  Recent federal court ruling allowing United Airlines to terminate its drastically underfunded pension plan  and pile $6.6 billion of liabilities on a small federal agency means retired pilot Ray Bryce's monthly check could be cut nearly 80%. 
[01:07:30]  But here comes.  You'll run with that, Jimmy.  To about $2,000.  But Bryce's situation is not unusual.  Wow.  Okay, and go.  Exactly.  Let's see how good of a broadcaster you really are.  Yeah.  What's this whole thing with the pensions?  I mean, it's got to be going crazy.  It's out of control.  It's nuts.  It's insane.  Pensions equal comedy.  Always.  You can tell a pension story and just the jokes will fly out of the air.  Yeah, look right here.  It goes, along with the new laws protecting retirement funds, it is obvious the value of unions also should be reassessed. 
[01:08:00]  Ah!  I want to bring something to the program.  I try to read some of those smart little items in the paper, and your brain just explodes after the first two paragraphs.  It's like you feel like you're just biting something.  I want to get through it.  I want to get the knowledge here, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You go over it a couple times, and you just start sweating from the inside out.  Who was the guy?  Right. 
[01:08:30]  Like you're reading, and you see a name pop up that doesn't look familiar, but in the context of the story, they're placing it like you should know who it is already.  You're like, I've got to backtrack and see who this guy is.  We really don't have a say.  No.  Washington completely controls us, and we just sit around like dummies.  That's it.  I just try to deny what an idiot I am every once in a while.  I'll just, like, instead of going right to the sports pages, I try to, like, read it.  I try to read the Times for a while, and it's a great, like, well-written paper.  Yeah.  I would fold it neatly on an aircraft, because the Sunday Times will get you through a cross-country flight, and it's just so dry. 
[01:09:00]  I've hung out at bars and coffee shops with the Sunday New York Times just to see if I could get through, like, a bunch of articles.  Oh, my God.  I'm an online guy, as far as information goes.  I'd rather just get a bunch of different stories from different places, and you read the New York Times.  I don't think I've ever, ever read the New York Times.  Well-written paper, again, I mean.  Speaking of which.  They call everybody Mr. Which annoys me, like Mr. Bin Laden.  Speaking of which.  Mr. Bin Laden. 
[01:09:30]  I think Eric, we're getting ready for the show, and he goes, you guys want to do anything on the filibuster?  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  No, you didn't.  The filibuster.  Did you or did you not, Eric?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  You guys want to do it.  You want to riff on the filibuster.  You wanted to get as much info as possible on the filibuster, and Ant and I looked at each other and just went, uh, filibuster?  Um, no.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Eric, why don't you explain what a filibuster is?  Yeah, why don't you use it when your dust buster is broken? 
[01:10:00]  You borrow it from Phil, the neighbor.  Oh, he's giving you a ho-ho-ho.  Get on mic there, Eric.  Why don't you get on mic?  What's the filibuster story?  Let's go.  Why don't you show your intelligence right now?  Come on.  Tell us what the filibuster is.  Jimmy brought up the, uh, the, uh, pension story?  Go ahead.  The fun fiasco?  I think we had a few big laughs.  Fun fiasco?  You're welcome.  What's this filibuster story, Eric?  They're, uh, stalling for the approval of George Bush's, uh, federal judge appointees. 
[01:10:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, stalling.  Ah!  Stalling?  I think there's a little more to it than that.  Yeah, the filibusters, I believe, they just continually talk and continually, until the time runs out, which is...  This kind of stall, huh?  ...unequal to a stall.  Right.  But as far as comedic fodder, uh...  Yeah.  I don't know, Hawking.  So they're filib...  Where's the mic?  He threw the mic away.  Talk to the mic, what are you doing? 
[01:11:00]  He just flipped the mic away, like, he's done.  What is the issue?  What is the issue?  Yeah, what's the issue?  You're obsessed with the filibuster?  Yeah, why the stalling?  You find it to be Richard Pryor in 1979?  Obviously, if you asked us, if we want to talk about this, you must have seen some merit in the story, some way that it could be incorporated into the Opie and Anthony show, or you never would have even brought it up.  So, filibuster, go.  It's nonsense, because the conservative side is trying to abolish the whole filibuster angle, and every time something comes up where there's a lot of filibustering going on, whoever the opposing party is, every time tries to make this illegal, even though it's the constitutional part. 
[01:11:30]  There you go.  Oh, one side does one thing, the other side does the other thing, and there's the comedy show in the middle going, what do you want from us?  What do you want from us?  Yep.  Oh, well, that's good.  The filibuster.  All right.  There you go. 
[01:12:00]  How about something else, just a little bit lighter and more conducive with comedy?  Anybody have the latest Alzar Cowie beheading on video we can chit-chat about?  Jesus.  Wow.  You guys want to do something on the filibuster?  So there's some kind of stall thing happening in Washington.  Right.  That's all I need to know.  Thank you.  Good job, Hook.  I can't be bothered with that.  I'm an indie yuppie.  What the fuck is an indie yuppie?  What?  They have a whole article in the New York Post today about, are you an indie yuppie? 
[01:12:30]  I have no idea what that is.  Indie, I guess, as in indie music.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, alternative music.  Oh, so it's like kind of a poser wannabe?  Yeah, it's not really the commercial, you know, alternative rock, basically.  Indie goes a little deeper.  Used to, anyway.  Yeah, man.  So then there's a whole poll to find out if you're an indie yuppie.  Oh!  Because indie yuppies, Anthony, are swapping pinstripes for white stripes.  Oh, God.  So basically, you know, these young go-getters that were wearing suits and stuff are starting 
[01:13:00]  and discover that that isn't as cool as dressing down, man, and walking around with your iPod.  Are these real people, or is this just some kind of gag?  No, this is real.  No, I mean, like, the newspaper comes up with it because, like, one guy around their office  is doing this, so they make it sound like it's a huge movement that's going on.  Do you see these people?  Yeah.  Are these real people, indie yuppies?  You know, Anthony, when you get out of your car and walk around a little bit, you see some  amazing things in Manhattan.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd rather drive right through it, right to the sanctity of my home. 
[01:13:30]  I even hit the garage door opener.  It opens it up.  I drive in, shut it behind me.  And shut the world behind you as well.  I never even have to deal with the world.  Well, here's a quick little poll.  Are you an indie yuppie?  Do you own a vintage T-shirt purchased at Urban Outfitters?  Basically meaning like...  Vintage would be...  Like the old, like, well, the example here, the Rolling Stones 1975 U.S. tour. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, the Big Tongue?  Well, but basically they're, you know, they're shirts that were popular or whatever.  Like a throwback in a way.  Yeah, like a throwback.  Like they have the Doors T-shirts that, the actual Doors T-shirts that you used to be able to buy, whatever, $20, $25.  They're all remakes, right?  Yeah, they remake them.  Although Shopping LA has the original stuff in this store that's really cool.  Does it really?  And then they have, like, Zeppelin and, you know, stuff like that, Rolling Stones.  Do you own one of those, Anthony?  No, I don't.  You don't own any vintage T-shirts? 
[01:14:30]  No vintage T-shirts.  All right.  With maybe the old-fashioned, you know, lettering on it or anything?  None.  At all.  No?  Nope.  All right.  So that's one you don't have here.  Have you been on the list at a rock show at least once in the past month?  No.  This proves that you're an indie yuppie.  No.  That you're cool enough to be on the list, man.  The list?  No.  Go to the will call window and pick up your free tics.  On the list at Jimmy's HBO taping.  Does that count?  That's not bad.  It certainly doesn't. 
[01:15:00]  But I was on the list at a rock show for Motorhead.  Oh.  All right.  Jimmy's an indie yuppie.  And he does indeed have vintage T-shirts.  No, I know.  But they're all, like, remakes.  But they're still vintage.  It doesn't matter if it's remakes or not.  Yeah, you've got vintage shirts.  Uh-oh.  You could be one of these yuppies.  Those Richard Pryor shirts and stuff.  Yeah, the Richard Pryor shirts.  Those are kind of like vintage T-shirts.  Of course, sure.  So you're two for two.  Are we working with an indie yuppie and we didn't even know it?  Are we going to be?  Are your white iPod earbuds a source of pride?  Oh, he doesn't like his iPod earbuds.  I loathe them because they hurt my little ears. 
[01:15:30]  Got his little ears.  So no, they're a source of shame and agony.  No, I don't like the iPod ear things.  Because they're too much of that.  You know, you see people walking around and you just go, ugh.  I'd rather have them a different color.  I mean, the iPod is just taking over New York City.  Bill Gates thinks it's going to go away for some reason.  He's something to do with cell phones, he was saying.  Oh, it's all going to cell phones.  That's obvious.  If they incorporate all this stuff into a reasonable-sized cell phone, then, yeah, you  won't have to carry it all. 
[01:16:00]  No, everything's going to go right to the cell phone.  That is very obvious.  That's the way this all is going.  It's the thing you have to carry around with you.  You don't have to carry an iPod or anything else.  What else is there?  It's an iPod, a cell phone.  I carry a camera.  A camera.  Celebrity sightings.  A MiFi.  A MiFi.  Good point, Hawk.  There you go.  A MiFi.  A PDA type thing, like a trio or something.  The P volume of encyclopedias in case you want to discuss filibusters. 
[01:16:30]  Exactly.  But the only one you really have to carry with you is the cell phone.  Right.  So if they could put all that in the cell phone, you just carry one thing.  Much better.  And, you know, the camera phones, it's a goof right now.  But eventually, you know that's going to get to the point where the shot's going to be  just as good as your camera.  Yeah.  Yeah, the cell phone cameras now just stink on ice.  It's still just a goof.  And I know they're adding the flash and this and that, but they still have a little ways 
[01:17:00]  to go.  But they already have it.  You know they have the technology to do this.  Of course they do.  It's every picture you take.  All right, hold on.  All right, did it save?  Wait, hold on.  Wait, it stinks.  One megapixel?  Yeah.  Hire a guy to sketch it real quick.  Awful.  I was reading a great article on cell phones and how everything's going to be done through  the cell phone like we're discussing here, including like purchasing stuff through like  vending machines.  Yep.  Like you go to a vending machine.  Let's say you want a Pepsi.  And there's a number you call right there. 
[01:17:30]  And you just call up the number, what have you.  Maybe throw in a code.  I'm not, you know, sure.  It's been a while.  And then that's charged to your phone bill.  And there you get the Pepsi.  Boom.  And there's going to be all sorts of things like that you could do with your cell phone.  But I read this article like two, three years ago.  Yeah, what happened?  And they're doing it in Finland or something like that.  It's always somewhere far away.  Hey, I just read something yesterday about a supermarket that has fingerprint billing where  you walk through, you put your thumb on a scanner, and obviously you have to do something beforehand. 
[01:18:00]  Put your account, bank account or something on your thumb, you know, and link it up.  And then you put your thumbprint in there and it reads it, knows what your bank account  is, and deducts the money right from there.  So you're not going to sit with some animal cashier that gets everything wrong.  Then you just leave.  That's it.  You and yourself.  Me and dumb Bob Kelly had an argument one time about this, but eventually, probably not  in our lifetimes, that's where I was wrong, paper money will cease to exist. 
[01:18:30]  It will just be a thing of the past.  Like gold bullions would just be a thing of like, what?  Gold bullion.  You know what I mean?  You won't need it anymore.  It will all be, like you said, from an account, a little chip or something like that.  And we'll all wear Mylar suits, which I can't wait for.  And we're all just wearing Mylar and we're traveling in the flying car.  Yeah, maybe in your world.  Go up past 100th Street here in Manhattan.  You tell me that paper money is going to go away anytime soon.  No, no, no.  It probably won't be for 100 years, but it will happen.  We live in this isolated white world. 
[01:19:00]  I mean, there is, I mean, it's great.  Technology is great and stuff.  But when you start saying that money is going to go away in our lifetime or maybe even, let's say, the next generation, it ain't happening anytime soon.  There will be a few liquor stores and stuff that might still take cash.  But for the most part, I see what Jimmy is saying.  I don't really use a lot of cash these days.  I use cash for things like, you know, you buy the bagel in the morning and things like that.  But any major purchase, I don't remember the last time I used cash for anything as far as any kind of major purchase or really just any purchase I make on a daily basis. 
[01:19:30]  It's not from something really small.  I understand.  That's what I'm saying.  We're ready.  We're ready.  This room is ready.  Roll it out.  We're ready to never use money again.  But there's a curve out there.  Well, to us, like a computer chip is something, like, it's a huge step up.  Like, wow.  But that's like saying, look at cell phones or whatever like that.  Like, everyone has them now.  Whereas in 1981, a cell phone was like, whoa, nobody in a shit neighborhood would have that.  So it's like, as everything else progresses, the little chip on your thing will become like a... 
[01:20:00]  See, it becomes commonplace.  Eventually, they'll stop making the money for counterfeiting reasons and stuff like that.  It'll be a lot harder to counterfeit a chip, I guess.  The other morning, also, we were watching a report on the new PlayStation.  Mm-hmm.  Game console.  Yeah.  PlayStation, what, 3?  Yep.  And what were they saying this thing could do?  What were some of the features?  I forgot now.  Suck your dick.  Wow.  Just have a hole in the back.  Just shove it in.  What the hell was it?  Like, seven or eight guys could play at one time on one unit, but there was something else that made it really cool. 
[01:20:30]  Downloading MP3 files, probably.  Yeah, you could download things.  It hooks up.  You could play online.  Something with video and photos, too.  Yeah, but the point I want to make, you know, they show this great technology on TV.  We're sitting in the office getting ready for a radio show, and Anthony and I are thinking,  well, there it is.  Mm-hmm.  Because then the reporter has to say, the bad news, it won't be available until the end of 2006.  Yeah.  But they're showing us one.  Yeah, I know.  It's right there.  It's right there.  You know they're making them already. 
[01:21:00]  Jimmy's getting pounded, by the way.  Why?  Because filibuster would be found in the F encyclopedia.  Oh, I thought it was a B.  And, of course, our listeners, not letting you get away with that one.  And they absolutely shouldn't.  I'm a P-H-U-C-K-I-N-G idiot.  It's a filibuster.  Let's go to Eric in New York City.  Eric.  It's a filibuster, you tool.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Eric?  Eric, they showed a commercial the other day of a mother of old phones. 
[01:21:30]  It's from Nokia, and obviously it's coming from Europe, you know, because they're way ahead of us.  This phone does everything.  Video camera, regular camera, MP3 player, Internet, everything was in that phone.  Oh, yeah?  It was the most, and they said, they were advertising it like a movie.  Coming in June 22nd.  All right.  Worth the car crash?  Why?  It wasn't worthy of a car crash.  It was just, um, you said Europe is far ahead of us technologically, but they're actually not. 
[01:22:00]  I think they are, and so is Japan.  Yeah, Japan.  Japan is overrated.  Japan's kicking our ass with the technology.  Opie, I have a question for you.  I don't know what you're doing.  Are you looking forward to Jimmy moving into your neighborhood and yelling, monster rain?  I don't really get that.  Wow, this guy.  Meaning I'm going to blow Jimmy?  Not only...  Or is he going to blow me?  I think he's going to blow you.  Wait, wait, wait.  You want me to get him to blow you? 
[01:22:30]  No, I want you to blow Opie.  Okay, he's both in the ring.  He's both a beat, and he's both going to blow each other.  I'll get blood all over my porch.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  I don't know.  That wasn't a car crash.  That was what happens when the car just runs out of gas on a hill.  Pulls over into the grassy medium.  No real excitement.  It just stalls at the top of the hill.  Flerker, flerker, flerker.  You got to go.  Also, there was no cell phones in 1981.  As you used as your example, there wasn't a cell phone network in the United States until 1983. 
[01:23:00]  So, again, the listeners don't want to let it get away with a couple of years there.  Wow.  Alexander Graham B. from Whackbag.com.  Douchebags.  All right, here we go.  Cell phones.  F-O-N-E-S.  Jesus, I have an S.  We're still trying to figure out if we are indie yuppies here, Anthony.  Let's see.  I am so far.  Yeah, Jimmy is.  I'm much more progressive than anyone would think.  The next question.  Do you know what grime is?  Yes. 
[01:23:30]  Grime.  Grime.  G-R-I-M-E.  After you have sex, the next morning, it's the stuff you scrape between your ball bag  and leg and sniff.  I don't know what grime is.  I have no idea what grime is.  Anyone out there know what grime is?  I can assume, but I choose not to.  Grime.  It doesn't tell you what it is?  No.  Assholes.  Do you know what grime is?  I don't know what it is.  I'm looking quickly here.  I don't see an explanation for that one at all.  No.  If someone could help us out, what is grime as far as that hip culture? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  The hip indie yuppie culture.  Grime.  Have you ever done a web search to find a name of a song used in a VW ad?  No.  What are they using really hip music for the car ads?  Yeah, they're reaching.  How about this one?  Do you have a Gmail account?  What the hell is a Gmail account?  Google has some kind of a mail account, which I don't have.  No, I certainly don't.  Really?  But why would you want a Gmail account instead of just a regular... 
[01:24:30]  Because it's cooler, man.  But what makes it cool?  I don't know.  No idea.  Never heard of it.  All right, well, you know...  Oh, someone knows?  Danny?  Where's Danny?  I thought he went to get Ben.  Danny?  Oh, Danny, you know?  Danny?  A Gmail...  Yeah, I'm like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the way it's set up, and they give you a hell of a lot more storage than Yahoo does  or anybody else.  Really?  Does it cost money?  No, it's free.  Oh, for advertising.  But it gives you a lot more space. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, two gigs for free, and the way the layout is, it's just set up a lot better than most  email accounts.  Yeah.  But where is it stored, though?  I'm sorry?  Where is it all stored?  Google servers.  I don't know.  I'm not falling for it, Jim.  No, I'm actually not messing with you, because I know friends of mine have eight Gmail accounts,  and it's like, but what is the advantage other than advertising, I suppose, for them?  Do they send...  Like, do you have to allow them to send ads into your box?  Is that how they support it?  Well, there's targeted text ads in the email, so basically Google scans the words in your  email and will give you targeted ads on the side. 
[01:25:30]  No picture ads.  There's nothing taken up the screen.  But, you know, let's say there's Opie and Anthony in the text of the email.  Good example, Danny.  There will be links to Foundry Music and opieandanthony.com.  Hey, scan your email.  I don't like that.  It's words.  Yeah, keywords get scanned.  You think I need all kinds of stupid ads for, like, pedals and files?  All right, Danny.  So that's what a Gmail account is.  Do you know what Grime is? 
[01:26:00]  Absolutely not.  No clue.  Try to find out if someone out there knows what Grime is.  Put them right through if they know.  Are you an indie yuppie?  The next question.  That's brilliant.  That's effing brilliant.  Did Garden State speak to you as no other film ever has?  Ever see Garden State?  I've seen it.  I like Garden State, but I found it entertaining.  It definitely wasn't something I could relate to.  It didn't speak to me.  It was definitely a good movie.  Actually, I love the soundtrack.  I get jealous when Nathaniel just talks to you. 
[01:26:30]  What did he say?  He didn't talk to me.  No, he didn't talk.  Oh, who is he talking to?  The Hawk.  The Hawk?  What did he say, Eric?  I see him in there talking, and I can't hear him, and I'm like, what's he saying?  We're fixing a piece of production.  What's the matter?  Is everything all right?  Everything's fine.  Hawk's a little, uh...  Hawk's a little testy today.  What's wrong?  Get back on the mic.  Get out of my guy, Hawk.  What's he talking over?  Did that filibuster thing have you upset?  Oh, come on.  What's the matter?  He goes, no.  No.  Like, I mean it.  What's the matter, Hawk?  Nothing.  We were fixing something in the back, that's all. 
[01:27:00]  These guys are a little testy, though, today.  Yeah.  Am I?  Yeah.  You got a little spunk to you.  These guys communicate during the show.  It's really strange.  They got IMs going back and forth, and then conversations going on through their headphones.  They're landing planes.  I don't know what the hell they're doing.  The notes, little post-it notes are being run back and forth.  Are you surprised we didn't go with your whole filibuster thing?  He can't get over it.  No.  We were looking for material, and I saw that on the news server there.  I'm like, do you want to do anything with the filibuster?  No.  If we want to blow off comedy gold like that, he just can't understand it. 
[01:27:30]  I understand what you're saying, though.  It's such an obvious go-to.  Yeah.  You got the Johansson audio, you got the Psycho-Extrofriend, and filibuster.  Yeah.  I think we should just filibuster, and then we'll never get to the filibuster.  Yeah, we'll never get to the filibuster.  Just filibuster.  We'll get a filibuster.  Thank you.  Brand new word on the show.  Filibuster.  Filibuster.  Grime is dirt, David is saying. 
[01:28:00]  Come on.  We know that.  That's the obvious one, but as far as this indie, yuppie, hip culture, what does grime mean?  Grime is a new term for techno or house music.  Grime is rap in the U.K.  Grime, a sub-genre of U.K. garage music.  Right?  Well, it's some type of music.  Grime is U.K. music mixed between techno and alternative, and it sucks.  Sub-genre?  Sub-genre.  Let's go to John.  That's what grime is.  What's up, John? 
[01:28:30]  Hey, it's basically like hip-hop with more bass.  It's like a two-step kind of version.  It's not very good at all.  Two-step version.  Does anybody have an example of grime we could hear?  Yeah, we would play a little grime.  Look under, like, Dizzy Rascal.  Dizzy Rascal?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  He's our producer.  Dizzy Rascal.  Travis is going to Ben's place to hopefully see what the hell's going on.  It's now 8.30, and no word from our executive producer, Ben. 
[01:29:00]  That is very odd.  All right, let's go to HP.  What's up?  HP, what's up?  Ah, man, hey, that's slang for dope.  It is not.  It is, too.  I was in the pit.  All right, let's go to Tim.  Tim.  Oh, you found some Dizzy Rascal?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's going on?  Oh, man, little Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  You know what grime is?  Yeah, it's like underground.  They call it garage music here.  It's like a rap.  It's like slow down. 
[01:29:30]  It sounds like shit.  It's garbage, man.  It's like you can pull it off like Kazaa, and you get it like in England and shit.  It stinks, man.  Yeah, do you know any Dizzy Rascal?  Because we have the whole Dizzy Rascal catalog here.  Wow.  No, I never heard of that.  Dizzy Rascal.  I think grime is that shit that grows on your sink if you don't wash it.  It looks almost like a lime deposit.  Right.  They call that grime, but yeah, as far as the music term, it stinks, man.  You don't want to play none of that shit.  Trust me.  All right, thank you.  Well, we got an example of grime. 
[01:30:00]  Here's a song called Fix Up, Look Sharp.  Oi!  A little grime.  Yeah!  Buddy, you're a good man.  It sounds kind of like the dude from American Idol during the tryout.  Fix up, look sharp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sounds like the opening of the song is just being looped. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, it is.  Like the meat of the song that's not getting.  This is the Rascal!  What?  Go now!  You're on, indeed!  My partner wants it from the street to the sidewalk. 
[01:31:00]  They're trying to see if he stays true to his brother.  We hear another Dizzy Rascal, remember?  Maybe this is just a bad one.  This could be the B-side.  Comparison.  It's catchy, too.  I would like you to do some kind of lyrics.  It sounds like the kid that was trying out for American Idol that got arrested.  Remember, we were playing...  Oh, right.  Right.  We were playing his stuff when the tryouts were going on, and he was just completely out  of his mind.  Uh-huh.  And they called it, like, crunk or something like that.  Paul Abdul called it crunk.  This is some grime, though. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Let's listen to some more grime.  This is, uh...  Just a Rascal.  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  Rock and roll McDonald's!  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  Dizzy Rascal!  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  He's just a rascal!  Dizzy Rascal!  He's just a rascal!  Yeah, the bottom end's a little more techno, you can tell. 
[01:32:00]  That's like the only difference between that and any other hip-hop you would hear, I guess.  They remind me of these guys, Asher D and Daddy Freddy.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know if they were both British or one of them was.  They're like a rap group from like the 1980-something.  I heard they were big with the Lords, that gang that used to go around, Jimmy.  Yeah, well, the one guy who was British, he'd go, leave him alone! 
[01:32:30]  Let's get a Doughboy.  What's up, Doughboy?  What's going on, guys?  You guys missed the whole angle with the indie coolness of Gmail.  All right.  The fact that it was so indie cool is because you only got a couple invites, and you had to invite your friends.  So if you had a Gmail account, it was back when it was one gig, and it was new, and nobody really knew about it.  But if you knew about it, you were cool.  And if you had one, you were ultra cool.  You were Trey cool.  Right.  It was fucking gay.  But you have to be invited.  Now you can just go get one, right? 
[01:33:00]  Well, no.  I don't know if you can go get one, but they give you like 250 invites now.  So it's like everybody and their brother has one.  I'm scared.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, have a nice day, boys.  All right.  So there you go.  And there's some samples of grime.  We learned something new on this road.  A dizzy rascal.  A dizzy rascal.  That's going to run through my fucking head all morning.  Oh, I know.  Sucker.  I know.  A dizzy r-right.  All of a sudden, your iPod's going to be filled with grime music.  Dude, this stuff isn't bad after all. 
[01:33:30]  He's drunk and shitting.  He's drunk and shitting.  That's the kind of sucks.  Dude, I had that sushi.  I had that sushi.  I had that sushi.  Poor Ben.  Not even here to defend himself.  A cock like a thigh.  A cock like a thigh.  That's classic.  I'm digging the grime.  All right.  Sean from Columbus is saying filibuster is what Ben tells guys what he plans to do with women. 
[01:34:00]  I'm going to filibuster.  Very funny, Sean.  All right.  Here we go.  Are you an indie yuppie?  Oh.  Back to this.  Do you own at least one white belt?  A white belt?  No.  What's the deal with white belts?  It's very hip and very retro.  We are so fucking out of touch.  That's very retro.  It's corny.  You've seen the white belts around town?  I'm out of it.  You're supposed to wear them like there's some hip, cool pants. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  And you're supposed to be just like the 70s svelte, too hip for the room douche.  It's awful.  All right.  If the listeners want to help us out with some of this stuff, please call the show.  I'm not getting a bunch of these.  Do you have a fully articulated stance on Bright Eyes?  What?  Do you have a fully articulated stance on Bright Eyes, the band?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Well, they're political in nature, I guess.  They trashed Bush online, remember? 
[01:35:00]  Of course they did.  God.  Can I just ask the rest?  Can you fucking bands for once have an unpredictable opinion?  Okay.  Back to what we're talking about.  Just once.  Once.  Please.  I could not even.  You gave me 200% more information than I had about what that even meant.  Well, Bright Eyes is, I know they're a big band these days, but to have a fully articulated  stance on Bright Eyes.  They're real.  Those guys are mavericks, though, man.  I mean, they'll go right on TV and say the government's bad. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  Those guys are pretty out there.  That's never been done before.  Dude, that is a risk.  That's a risk.  You want to take a show business risk?  Criticize the gay mafia.  See how far you get.  Shitheads.  All right.  Can we play some Bright Eyes?  What was the song that they played on Leno and got in trouble for?  Does anyone remember?  Oh, I know that song.  Danny knows.  Danny's coming back.  Danny's working extra hard today because Nathaniel trumped him.  Smashed his face.  And that video's up on opianthony.com.  Nathaniel's assault on the media. 
[01:36:00]  We started the show with it.  It's hilarious.  You've got to check it out.  Opianthony.com.  Danny, you know the song?  I forgot the name of the song, but I do have it cut.  I can get it for you in a minute.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we'll check that out in a second.  Bright Eyes.  See what they're about.  Is this Travis calling in?  Hello?  Hey, Travis.  Hey, Travis.  What's up?  We are outside the Ben Sparks residence, we believe.  Are you sure I want to see?  Who are you with?  With Master Poe. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, no.  Is Master Poe going to break down the door?  He can break the door down.  I don't know.  A couple of karate chops.  All right.  Well, Travis, what are we going to do?  Just ring his buzzer and see what happens?  Yeah, we rang the buzzer.  The outside little post says, yeah, well, we don't want to give the name over the air.  Of course not.  But the name on the door is different from the B Sparks that we saw outside.  All right.  Well, ring the buzzer.  That's what we're doing.  We're knocking on the door. 
[01:37:00]  Master Poe might have to break it down.  Wait, you're actually at the door of his apartment?  Yes, well, we think so.  Yeah, bang that.  He's in there.  What did he say?  Holy shit, I overslept.  Wait, what happened?  He just said, holy shit, I overslept.  Hang on, he's probably coming.  All right.  Oh, my God.  We got to send people to his house. 
[01:37:30]  I heard him in there.  He's not coming to the door yet.  Hey, Ben.  You got to tell us what's going on there, Travis.  You guys want to talk to him?  Yeah, of course.  All right, hang on.  Ben, I want to talk to you.  No.  He says no.  Of course not.  What do you mean he says no?  Put him on the fucking phone.  I can't bust through the door.  Ben, Ben, Jimmy wants to talk to you.  Ben, we were worried about you.  We thought you were attacked by a midget. 
[01:38:00]  Master Poe's making jokes.  Yeah, I know.  Is that what that was?  That's why we're not laughing.  Yeah.  My neighbors are freaked out.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Ben wants us to leave.  Wants you to.  Ben gets very, uh...  It's not our problem.  His neighbors will freak out.  He gets all nasty.  Too bad about his neighbors.  It's not our problem.  He overslept.  He's the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show, and he's getting mad at us  because we finally had to wake him up at 8.45 in the morning.  He said he's going to get in the shower.  Is he coming in?  Tell him to call us immediately. 
[01:38:30]  Why is it the shower?  Call the show immediately before he gets in the shower.  Okay.  Hang on.  I got to walk back over there.  Uh-huh.  Ben, I want you to call the show immediately before you get in the shower.  I think he's already in the shower.  All right.  Good job, guys.  That's Travis and Master Poe waking up our executive producer.  That's funny.  Holy shit, I overslept.  What an understatement that is.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  All right.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Now we can do the show knowing that Ben is alive. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Because we've all been just sitting here wondering.  It felt really bad if we played that Ben Sparks bit that we played earlier.  And as it's playing, like, he's just green on his bed.  All right.  Jesus.  Jesus.  What the hell?  As he's got his XM on and it's playing.  All right.  And he's just, ugh.  And the last thing he hears before his little heart finally gives out is us shitting on him.  Where is that fat hog idiot?  For the last bit of drunken vomit goes down his windpipe. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  He's humming dirty deeds.  Ben Scott.  Dirty deeds.  I've got big balls.  Are you an indie yuppie?  Just a couple more questions here.  Do you have a TiVo?  Most of us have that now, right?  TiVo.  DVR.  Yeah, DVR is the way to go from the cable company.  I'm actually going to, I'm switching to Time Warner Cable when I move because I have a...  DVR is the way to go. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, is that better go?  Time Warner is a good cable service with their DVRs.  Yeah, Optimum still has some bugs to shake out of it.  The only problem is I can get 100 hours on my DirecTV TiVo.  100 hours.  You can only get like 36 hours on these stupid DVRs.  Yeah, 36 hours, that's a drag.  That's a lot of time, but if you're recording a series or something like that, sometimes it will repeat and you want to get more time.  DVR is simple.  You don't have to hook up anything.  It just comes with your cable box. 
[01:40:30]  It comes with your cable.  The TiVo, I always had a problem with it.  I've got two TiVos.  The first one I got was a while back and the whole thing with plugging it into the goddamn telephone line and it calls and updates at night and it was never updating right.  It just didn't work.  I finally just ripped it out.  Went with the DVR.  Do you have to update that or no?  DVR?  Yeah.  No.  Okay.  No, it's because it's all your cable company.  It's all just hooked up.  If they come out with something new or better, yeah, you get it.  Now, let me ask you.  I have DSL because I hate the cable companies. 
[01:41:00]  I think they monopolize, so I never supported them.  So, I got satellite.  Yeah, man.  I know.  I know.  It's just my little way of not contributing.  And I have DSL.  Which is faster, cable or DSL?  Cable.  Is it?  Yep.  Okay.  Cable, much better.  Much better?  Yep.  Absolutely.  All right.  A couple more really fast here.  Have you ever paid more than $50 for one pair of jeans?  Yes.  Who hasn't?  I was going to say, I think everyone has now.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You can't get out of a store for less than $50 for a pair of jeans. 
[01:41:30]  You ever pay more than a nickel for a bus ride?  Jesus.  Do you have a blog?  Jimmy does.  Jimmy has a blog.  Not an active one.  Yeah, why haven't you updated that lately?  I used to love reading your blog.  Thank you.  Because creatively, I'm very satisfied here.  So, it's I have an outlet.  All right.  And finally, are you confused as to whether or not it's okay to like Coldplay?  No, I'm not confused.  I could give a flying fuck about it.  You like the Coldplay?  I don't care.  I like the Coldplay.  I don't know what they sing.  I'm sure I've heard them, but I don't know.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:00]  What's the name of Coldplay song?  Here's their hit.  Hawk?  Well, I don't know if they're going to know it.  Yeah, go ahead.  This is a hit.  I'm going to go to hell.  I'm going to go play in the piano.  Hi, Andy.  I think we need vocals. 
[01:42:30]  I've never heard this.  Yeah, you've heard this.  Sounds like Dave Matthews without the edge.  Their third album is about to be released.  It's going to be a smash.  What's the name of this song?  We sound like Bruce Hornsby?  Clocks. 
[01:43:00]  And then Yellow was a huge hit for them.  They had a million hits, actually, off their last album.  Yellow's off their first album.  You can't go where the others go.  I have no opinion.  Why would they do Coldplay, like in this indie yuppie story?  Well, if that comes up on your little radio there on the way home, are you listening to it?  I might or I might not.  It's one of those just background music.  I'm not going to sing along to it, chortling along as I drive down the highway to it.  I spent some time yesterday in Soho because I'm kind of couch shopping. 
[01:43:30]  And, you know, I've gone to Soho with you.  I never go down there, ever.  And my gay friend helped me couch shop.  Oh, we did.  For five hours yesterday.  Five hours?  Five hours with a gay man couch shopping.  But, yeah, because I'm kind of...  But why five hours?  A bunch of different stores.  And do you know how awful it is to have a gay guy calling his gay friend?  And, you know, they're discussing, like, my...  Because I had one picked out.  And I walked in and he's just like, oh, it's hideous.  Oh, you can't possibly pick something out.  And they're on the phone. 
[01:44:00]  We're in the store.  It's called Domain.  And he calls.  He goes, we're in Domain.  And I know the other guy must have said something.  He goes, I don't know.  That's just where he wanted to go.  And I was like, oh, I don't know.  Oh, they would just...  Ew.  What are you doing there?  I don't know.  He just wanted to come here.  Just go to Pottery Barn.  No, no, Mike.  Pick out one of the four couches they have on display.  That's it.  And wait your eight weeks and...  There you go.  And get it into your new apartment.  You might not get this, but when it comes to couches, I'm going to admit I'm a couch diva. 
[01:44:30]  Are you a couch diva?  I want a nice, cushy...  I found what I wanted, too.  Oh, you did?  It's a massive...  It's just high and you sink into it.  It's like...  My couch stinks.  I got a Pottery Barn.  It doesn't have any armrests.  Really?  Yeah, it just kind of falls off to the side.  It's just awful.  How deep is it?  Do you know what mine is...  It's comfortable, but...  44 inches deep.  It's a sectional, so, you know, you get anything going on your couch and all of a sudden...  It's not coming apart? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, it's like the ice sheets are separating and you're falling into the frigid...  The glacier.  The frigid Atlantic.  No, I hate my couch.  Do you really?  Yeah.  I'll sign it and put it on eBay.  Oh, really?  I don't get it.  I'm glad you said that, because before I forget, I've got to sell my TV.  It's an amazingly good television, if anybody wants it.  It's just big.  How old is it?  About two years.  Two years old.  In excellent condition.  54 inches.  54.  HD TV.  Why are you selling it?  Because I'm moving and I want to get a flat screen because I don't have the room. 
[01:45:30]  Oh.  Get an LCD.  This is a flat screen, but I mean, it's like a big floor unit.  I want to get one for the wall because I honestly just don't have the room for it.  Right.  So, I don't know how to sell it.  Look at you go.  Look at Jimmy go.  Let's all sell stuff on eBay.  Because I got a pair of rollerblades I hate from Solomon that I've had for about a year.  Five weeks.  Can you sign him?  Yeah, I'll sign him.  Jimmy will sign his television?  No, because it might not be an ONA fan that wants it.  I can't.  What the fuck?  Who wrote on this?  Some kid?  I'll sign my stupid rollerblades.  I'll sign the right foot and Anthony signs the left foot. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, I don't want to sign your rollerblades.  Those are yours.  I got my own junk I could sell.  What are you going to sell?  I don't know.  I got...  Wait a minute.  I got every single backstage pass we've ever gotten from any event we've ever done.  How is my shitty TV?  I can't...  Look, I got to sell a TV.  I can't compete with real paraphernalia.  I can't...  This is just a TV if you want to watch it.  Just a TV.  I can't compete with...  This is the backstage pass we had. 
[01:46:30]  This was like Cobain's shoe that I touched.  Nothing exciting about your TV?  No, unless it's like tranny porn.  Maybe some of that's burned into the fucking memory.  My dumb couches.  I'm trying to sell all this shit.  Well, let's bring some stuff in and just sell it.  You have to pick it up, though.  You have to come to my place and pick it up.  Oh, that's kind of dangerous.  Why?  Who the hell do you want coming to your house?  Well, it's my old apartment where I'm moving out of it.  Oh, okay.  Then I would try.  Listeners are fine.  Whatever. 
[01:47:00]  All right, we got Bright Eyes from Leno.  Oh.  They sang a song.  This was in the news a couple weeks ago.  When the president talks to God, and it was a really, really big deal.  They performed a song, and then the media had a field day with this.  We could take a listen here.  Please welcome Bright Eyes. 
[01:47:30]  When the president talks to God, are the conversations brief or long?  Does he ask to rape our women's rights and send poor farm kids off to die?  Does God suggest an oil hike when the president talks to God?  Oh, you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, man. 
[01:48:00]  Man.  Oh, Arlo Guthrie.  You're Arlo Guthrie.  You phony maverick.  You phony maverick.  Ugh.  Yeah, man.  Must be a big hit around the fire on the beach when he grabs his guitar.  Hey, man, I'm going to play a tune, man.  Send our farm boys off to die.  Yeah, man.  You fucking phony 1967 mentality maverick. 
[01:48:30]  They got a little angle there, though.  They suck.  Oh, they got an angle that is just so played.  That college student mentality, dog shit, I see nothing but rebellion against mommy and  daddy attitude.  Don't get me wrong.  This would stink if it was a pro-president song up on stage.  It's just awful.  Doing a whole patriotic song.  It's that effected, this is so important.  Listen how angry I'm playing my acoustic guitar.  It's like the anger is coming through, man. 
[01:49:00]  The angry artist, man.  Just here to deliver something to you.  I have something to say.  Shut up.  Although I will say in their defense, as much as I think they stink, at least they're  talking through the work.  As opposed to a guy like Cosby who fucking is mom and pop on it.  Ice cream.  And he's fingering people who stop over and giving them piss.  Bend over the table.  Leave me a piece of my pudding pop.  So at least these awful bandits speak.  What fucking corn balls.  You know, we're going to really rock it on the Tonight Show. 
[01:49:30]  Way to be anti-establishment.  Well, let's hear a little more, I guess.  When the president talks to God, are the consonants all hard or soft?  Is he resolute all down the line?  Is every issue black or white?  Does what God say ever change his mind?  When the president talks to God.  Oh, God.  When the president talks to God, does he fake that drawl or merely nod? 
[01:50:00]  Agree which convicts should be killed, where prisons should be built and filled?  Yeah!  Which mother's fraud must be concealed?  Yeah!  When the president talks to God.  That's right.  Yeah.  Open up the prison gates and let everyone go.  When the president talks to God.  Oh, I hope you get raped in your asshole.  Which one plays the better cop?  We should find some jobs the ghetto's broke.  No, they're lazy, George.  I say we don't. 
[01:50:30]  Just give them more liquor stores and dirty coke.  That's what God recommends.  Give them more dirty coke.  Yeah, that's what the government's doing.  Building the liquor stores in the black neighborhood.  Right, and giving them coke.  And giving them the coke.  Right.  Oh, my God.  That, by the way, right there is...  Thank you.  That is the left.  Yeah.  That is exactly what the left is.  Oh, no.  We're going to have discussion again.  No, we're not.  Just saying that's what it is.  Oh, this guy can't get any further.  And the right is just so brilliant.  The right is awful, but at least the right is consistent. 
[01:51:00]  Just acknowledge that, though.  A bunch of idiots, too.  I always acknowledge that.  Always.  No way.  All right.  The religious right.  You're equally as dopey.  All right.  Thank you.  How many times have I said the religious right is repulsive and awful?  They're terrible.  Okay.  They both stink.  It's somewhere in the middle, and this guy ain't even close to the middle.  That's all I want to hear.  They both stink.  I've said that, though, many times.  We've said that.  So many times.  I've never said that the far right is good.  They're atrocious.  But they're the same way they were in 1965.  The far right, as a matter of fact, is a lot more dangerous than the far left. 
[01:51:30]  Of course they are.  99% of the complaints.  The far left are babbling idiots that you just bitch slap around.  The far right can do some severe damage.  The problem with it is the far right is the same as they've always been.  You know what you're in for with them.  They're awful with freedom of speech.  They're awful with almost everything.  The far left is just this phony, we are different, and that's what bothers me about them.  I'd love to know this guy's solution to prisons.  That's what I'm saying.  Where's the solution, then?  Just child-like New Jersey action.  Yeah, build more prisons and fill them up. 
[01:52:00]  Wait, what?  Yeah.  Well, what's the option, then?  Right.  Not building prisons?  So what?  Let them out?  Because people in the ghetto have no responsibility for their actions, right?  Fucking intellectual superiority white boy.  That's exactly what it is.  It's the white government's fault.  Jimmy, listen to the guy's song.  It's the white government's fault that the ghettos have liquor stores, and people choose  to buy liquor in them and get drunk and maybe not work.  Another paternalistic white guy who thinks that little blacks are children and need to 
[01:52:30]  be coddled, and it's not their fault, man.  All right, can we listen to the rest of the song?  This guy singing sounds like Daryl, Daryl, and Daryl from Newark.  He's talk singing.  He's not singing.  He's just talking.  No, he's talking.  When the president talks to God, do they drink near beer and go play golf?  While they pick which countries to invade, which Muslim souls still can be saved?  I guess God just calls a spade a spade. 
[01:53:00]  When the president talks to God, just listen to the roar of us.  Which Muslim?  The election report, Al-Zarqawi.  Yeah, Al-Zarqawi, who just said it's okay to kill, what, Sunni Muslims?  Yeah.  Yeah, is that the one you're talking about, the Muslims who get along so well when we're  not there?  When the president talks to God, do you ever think that maybe he's not?  That that voice is just inside his head when he kneels next to the presidential bed?  Does he ever smell his own when the president talks to God? 
[01:53:30]  I doubt it.  Yeah, I doubt it.  I doubt it.  Phil Mish Mish.  Phil Mish Mish.  Well, this says it all.  Tad from San Francisco.  I think George Bush embodies all that's wrong with America.  I still want to punch this bright-eyes guy square in the face.  See?  Well, here we go.  Here's BJ from Philly.  BJ.  What's up, boys? 
[01:54:00]  It turns out I do have an articulated view on these guys.  All of a sudden, I do, too, now.  Chuck me up for that one, Oak.  All right.  Yes, they are a bunch of unimportant faggots.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go to New York City.  Hey, whoever in New York City, what's up?  What's up, Oak?  Hey.  I'm confused, Oak.  You always jump to the side of the left.  Do you believe the shit this guy's singing about?  Of course not.  I'm more of a moderate, first of all.  I care less about the left or the right.  The only thing I will say is I do get a little pissed off when, you know, Bush does what he 
[01:54:30]  has to do and all that.  That's fine.  But when he starts saying, and God bless America, and God this, and God that, that's  when I'm like, ugh.  Okay.  Keep that out of the goddamn government.  Just keep the religion out of it.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  So, the idea for the song is pretty interesting, but then, obviously, the guy...  Oh!  No, I'm just saying...  Interesting?  Are you kidding me?  No, hold on.  Shut the fuck up, dude.  I'll explain if you give me a minute, all right?  All right.  Cool.  Cool.  Go ahead.  I mean, you know, when the president talks to God, so, I mean, this guy, you know, is  talking about how Bush is using God and then doing this stuff, and that's just not... 
[01:55:00]  Shouldn't be.  But those nice Muslims he talks about.  Oh, no.  And sympathizes with them.  They don't use their God to lock people's fucking heads off with.  Everything he's saying in that song, I totally disagree with.  Yes, of course.  All right, cool.  He's the same idiot that would complain about God being talked about, and yet, if you tell  Muslims, don't do a certain thing, hey, man, you can't tell them not to talk about their  religion, man.  He'd be right there defending them. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  I'm out, guys.  Thanks.  To me, they're just fraudulent and inconsistent.  You know, he has the right to sing a song like that.  What I get pissed off about, and that's the only thing, is the whole God angle that is  used.  Yeah.  You know, if it...  Whatever.  When the president talks to God, and all those people in the audience...  Yeah!  Every line.  Yeah!  Gibberish.  All right.  Well, that was fun.  Hey, good news, Anthony.  I am annoyed.  I am, too, because, wow, you're really against the big administration, and they are on NBC. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Really fucking...  Really going after the corporations.  Yeah.  Give your money away, then.  Ugh.  Rape our women's rights, man.  Stop it.  Stop.  Just leave God out of it, is what I'm saying.  Yeah, I agree.  I don't want God mixed in at all.  Yeah.  Unless it's meaningful, and the Lord needs to be there.  Anthony, the assault on the media that happened this morning.  Oh, yeah.  From Nathaniel, it's a great piece of video.  It's now up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[01:56:30]  What makes it even extra special, Nathaniel's behind the reporter with a huge Opie and Anthony  sign, and then a listener shows up and starts giving the camera the finger.  The finger.  And then he just walks away, and then the reporter is done with his little thing he had  to do, turns around while he's still live on TV, and goes, what the fuck is your problem  to Nathaniel?  Here's the audio, just in case you missed it.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously 
[01:57:00]  swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit,  but it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put  a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  That was live on TV this morning.  Live on TV.  The news guy just lost his mind and turned around and said, what the fuck is your problem,  man?  It's funny, if he was reporting a rape or a murder, he would have no emotion about it.  Yeah.  But you fuck with this self-important idiot while he's doing his news report, and he's upset.  He gets all upset. 
[01:57:30]  And then he comes back from the tape piece, and then he has to go live again, and he's  just all flustered.  Listen to this.  Sorry about that distraction before.  The Transit Committee is expected to pass this later on today.  Who is this?  Because he knows, oh no, that went over live.  That video will get some action, and speaking of which, that's why I'm bringing it up again.  FARC.com has it up on their website.  Oh!  Thank you, FARC, once again, for helping out the show.  Thank you, Drew Curtis.  When our stuff gets on FARC, it goes everywhere. 
[01:58:00]  From that point on.  Yeah.  So, let's say hi to, uh, Frank.  Hey.  What's up, Frank?  Frank Caliendo.  Oh!  Believe it or not, I, you know, my timing's always off.  I was going to call in as George W. Bush and go, I like that song, man.  Who is that guy talking about?  Yeah, what a fool.  No, I, I, I like this song, but I wanted to say, I emailed you yesterday, Opie, and I, uh, I finally got my radio.  Oh, cool.  So now I, so now I can listen. 
[01:58:30]  I feel like an idiot for, for having taken so long to get one, but, uh.  Oh, no worries.  We, uh, look forward to you calling in the show now.  Yeah, and maybe they'll all be as entertaining as this.  Well, you should just, I think you should probably just start right off with your Bush, uh, impression.  It's, it's brilliant.  Well, uh, yeah, yeah, I, uh, it's always better to hear me than Caddy Adondo.  That guy is, uh, a, uh, what was that song again? 
[01:59:00]  It's always good to get to the end.  I, I, I, I'm doing Spanish words with him now and doing that bobblehead move that he does, that, just that burrito.  It's always good to pronounce something a little bit about it.  Look out for La Cucaracha, man.  They will get you with their, uh, their legs or whatever.  The end.  The end.  All right.  Listen, dude, we're running really late, so.  All right.  Well, I just want to say, hey.  Hello?  Hey. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Frank.  Frank.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, there you are.  Your phone's crapping out.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Well, I just want to say, hey, guys.  All right.  Hold on.  They want to give you the hotline so you can get right through.  Frank Caliendo, a friend of the show, checking in.  Quick break.  When we get back, we have, outside the studio, Rich Voss, Dave Mordal.  Uh-oh.  The lovely Bonnie.  I saw Bonnie's, uh, boobs.  They were very, very lovely.  Who's the girl with Dave?  Who's the girl with Dave?  Who's the girl that's sleeping?  Who?  All right. 
[02:00:00]  We'll find out, uh, who she is as well.  Right.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Bernie Gatsch.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio.  This is Bill Burrow, the red-headed white boy from Chappelle's show.  This is Lois Griffin from Family Guy.  Hey, this is adult film star and former gubernatorial candidate, Mary Kay.  This is Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Money Bible.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan, a.k.a. Brian Fellows.  Hey, this is the game, Triple H.  This is your big baby girl, Patrice O'Neal.  How are you, sweetie?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn. 
[02:00:30]  This is Sam Shat Thomas.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing, season one and season three.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong.  Hey, this is Larry the Gable Guy.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And y'all listening to O.P. and Anthony.  You said you're smart.  You're not dumb.  Like people think.  Come on. 
[02:01:00]  What is this?  Is this grime?  A little grime?  We're back with the O&A program in studio.  Rich Voss.  What's happening, man?  And his fiancee, Bonnie, on the lesbian couch.  Oh.  I wouldn't sit where you're sitting, by the way.  That's where he was licking when we came in. 
[02:01:30]  Ugh.  Listen, I'm a little tired.  It's not about you, dude, Beck.  Let me introduce your friend here, Dave Mordal.  Oh, you looked at me already.  And Dave Mordal.  Good morning.  Hey, I can't believe you've never met Anthony.  I never met Anthony.  No, I just heard really great things.  I really did.  Honestly, I feel like I know you now.  I just hate Rich Voss.  He talks about Anthony like he...  Me and Rich have...  What did you say last night?  How much he carried this show?  I said he's a genius.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He is.  He's an ad-lib genius.  Yeah, and then you said that continually over the bit we were listening to, so I never 
[02:02:00]  did get to hear him.  You know, I just...  Anthony's brilliant.  Opie's good with the knobs.  Opie knows how to turn the knob.  He knows the volume from Bay Area.  I know.  Rich Voss feeling good in front of his friends.  No, I know.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  I'm just having all my...  I'm getting all new windows from Hillsboro Glass, so I'm in a good mood.  What is Hillsboro Glass, Rich?  They're putting in the windows at my house.  Oh, they are?  Oh, so they're good at that kind of stuff then?  I already earned my money.  And look what else I got that I brought for you guys. 
[02:02:30]  You're going to like this.  My new t-shirt that says Voss Sucks.  Voss Sucks.  I'm going to go with the flow from the message boards.  Right.  Dave, carry it today.  Wait a minute.  Oh, man.  I can't wait for Hillsboro Glass to get over to your house today.  Why are you making it this easy for us to kill you today?  Because I'm just...  That is the worst font you could choose for a t-shirt.  What do you mean?  It's a black shirt that says Voss Sucks in the worst white basic font. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, because I'm just a plain guy.  I'm an average guy.  I like it, actually.  Yeah, you got to convince us.  Yeah, I do.  I actually do like it.  No distractions or anything.  It's just right there.  Yep.  No cleverness that you got to get.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing like that.  Just a black shirt with truth on it.  Yeah, no good taste.  Wouldn't you save money by coloring them on there and then just kind of ironing it so  it goes...  The wax stays in?  That's what I wanted to do, but, you know, just a couple guys that can call in from the  boards and get one.  You know?  You could have one, but I don't have triple X. 
[02:03:30]  You lost weight.  You look good.  You do look good.  Oh, thanks.  He's got a roll that's coming up.  Quiet.  Dave and Richard talk about it.  No, you look really good.  I like the hair.  Dave was saying just before we went on Mike's here that he stayed at Voss' place.  Is that the first time you've stayed there?  Yeah, that's the first place I've stayed at the new place, yeah.  It's creepy, right?  It's really creepy.  He's so proud of me.  You should hear him talk about his decorator.  Like there's somebody that really exists that did it, you know? 
[02:04:00]  Like he didn't just find it that way and just move stuff around.  He's got furniture that people have died on.  We moved the furniture.  You know how obsessive-compulsive this moron is?  We moved the furniture last night about four and a half inches.  He could barely watch the movie.  Oh, man, really?  Because the marks on the carpet weren't...  It was so uncomfortable.  What a mess, man.  And then we had to move it back.  It took like actually about four or five minutes to actually line it up.  He's such a...  You're another OCD guy?  Yeah, well, you know, you want things the way you want them, you know? 
[02:04:30]  Your house is your house.  I'm not going to argue with you on that one.  I understand, but...  It's a funny comedy we're watching.  Hotel Rwanda last night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I saw it last night.  Did you watch that?  You know, he should have won that Oscar hands down.  I said that, too.  Oh, my God.  This is like deja vu.  Anthony was saying it just before the show.  You want me to tell you why he didn't win it?  You want me to give you to me?  Oh, boy.  Oh, listen to me.  You see Norton's eyes get really wide.  Only because whenever the hands go off,  he's not going to be smart.  Here's the thing. 
[02:05:00]  Exactly.  Listen to me.  Here's the thing.  That happened in 94 during the Clinton administration.  So the Academy did not push that or give him the Oscar  because they knew millions of people would go see the movie.  He won the Oscar,  and people would know how bad that administration was during it.  So, you know...  Like it matters at this point?  Yeah, because if we ever invented a time machine  and gone back to that era...  Well, isn't that a good theory?  You can really criticize him and shake your finger at his face and go,  So you...  Now he doesn't get to be president again.  Well, also because... 
[02:05:30]  Of course, because of the amendment also, but...  Wow, what a...  I wonder how long it took him to come up with that, you know.  Now I've got to defend the left.  I've got to disagree with that.  There's probably some other reasons,  but behind like the...  You know, because it's not like a fun role like Ray Charles was,  but I don't think...  That's a fun role?  All the guys banging dope and screwing people on the road?  But it's still a positive role.  Yeah, it all works out in the end.  It's a blind guy.  Plotally cracking blind guy.  Kind of like your life.  It works out in the end.  Don Cheadle should have won, though.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  The guy's really good.  Yeah, he was huge.  He's got nothing.  When I met him, Don Cheadle,  he came up to me at the golf course.  He goes,  Oh, I saw you on Last Comic.  He goes,  You know, you were funny.  I'm friends with the director.  Then I saw him like five minutes later.  I go,  Can we take a picture together?  I went from a pier to a fat chick like that in a second.  I mean, I actually just call myself a pier.  Yeah, exactly.  You went from a pier?  Boy, how come?  Throw yourself off one.  How you haven't won an Oscar, I don't know.  I mean, because that's...  I don't know if you saw the gynecologist. 
[02:06:30]  Now it's catching.  Now I suck.  I thought the start was going to go,  then he asked him for his five iron.  Hey, Dave.  Can I ride in your golf cart?  You got to say it like,  Hey, man, let's do a picture.  Let's get a picture.  You got to do it like that.  It would be fun for both of us to do this.  Even though he knows you're being a fan,  I've done that many times.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm like 50 rungs below.  And I'm like,  Come on, let's just do a picture.  It would be fun to show my nephew.  Dave, I guess that didn't work with Bobby De Niro,  did it, Jimmy?  When you slowly touched his arm and went,  Bob! 
[02:07:00]  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Where?  Oh, you haven't heard that story yet?  My first celebrity shootout,  I had never been turned down.  The first one to shoot me down was De Niro.  Where at?  The Billy Crystal premiere.  No.  Fucking 700 Sunday.  I didn't know De Niro was...  Walks up, gently touches his arm.  Oh, how creepy.  Bob!  Dude, they said...  Bob!  Bob!  They said, no cameras.  You could not bring cameras to this.  I saw Harvey Keitel.  I was like, oh, I just said, no camera.  But I brought it up,  and then I saw De Niro,  and I saw my manager's assistant,  and I'm like, just, come on.  And she's like, I can't.  I'm like, just fucking, come on,  take the camera. 
[02:07:30]  And I just touches his forearm.  Oh.  And he's standing at Grace Hightower.  And I go, Bob?  Bob!  How creepy is that?  Like, I thought that he would think...  You look like Yoda when you do that.  He's so famous,  I thought that he would, like,  hear me call him Bob  and think that he must know me.  Right.  Like, I figured that was the inside track.  Like, he goes in the same rest area.  I'm not saying it's not stupid,  but I'm like, yeah,  I asked him for a...  I know what I should have said.  I have it planned.  I remember calling Richard Harris Rick  one time.  That's it? 
[02:08:00]  Never felt for it.  But wait, how did he say no to you?  He was...  I said, I should have talked to him  about being a comic and king of comedy,  but I just panicked.  I'm like, can I get a picture with you?  And he goes, nah,  I just want to go see...  I gotta go...  He's doing a celebrity picture.  Oh.  He's like, I just want to go see Billy.  He's like, if I take one,  a lot of people will ask.  He was polite.  He wasn't a dick.  He just, you know, whatever.  He blew you off.  He felt like you were a retarded child.  He had to be all nice about it.  And then Billy Crystal snapped at me.  I saw Bob Reiner,  and then I saw Billy,  and I saw him, I'm a comic,  you were great tonight.  I went to get a picture.  He goes, no cameras! 
[02:08:30]  And he walked away.  Oh, what a...  Oh, who is this?  Billy Crystal.  What a talented pile of, you know...  Thank God someone's saying that.  I can't stand Billy Crystal.  He makes me sick of everything he's done.  I like his films.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We know you have the same managers.  Oscars, just like watching Nathan Lane.  Enough with it dancing and singing  and imposing your head  on fucking cartoons already.  All right?  He was partners with Dave Hawthorne,  who struggles now,  and he won't fucking help him.  He stinks.  He should be a third guy  on the Don and Mike show.  That's how bad he is. 
[02:09:00]  Those guys are hilarious, though, man.  Oh, fuck.  Hold on.  Frida's calling from the bank.  Oh, yeah.  You're standing online.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's Frida again.  I'm driving down a hill.  Out to lunch is the show.  What happened?  I don't know what's going on.  Out to lunch,  where you're smashing that awful Frida,  because that bitch stinks,  and she's not funny.  Stop wrecking your fucking mediocre radio show  by letting her call in.  So out to lunch is the guys in Baltimore, I think?  Yeah.  But they're syndicated at JFK and DC.  And they're big fans of our show.  Yeah, they love you guys.  They hand out stickers for your radio. 
[02:09:30]  That's so weird.  That's like the lowest self-esteem radio guys.  Let's hand out stickers for them.  Why don't you promote your own show?  I know, because the guy has this enormous head,  so I'm surprised he even goes out in public.  But they're fucking big fans.  And, you know, we're on there,  so I'm fucking trashed Donna Mike.  You know why they're not fucking funny?  Because they won't have comics in.  Because comics will outshine them.  And if they were funny and secure,  like you guys are, right?  And lazy.  You're lazy, too.  This way you get comics.  You know, you're just too lazy. 
[02:10:00]  You're lazy fucking zeroes, all right?  We were just watching the clock,  waiting for you to come in,  knowing that we'd get a good hour.  And I could just sit here, you know.  And so they won't have comics in.  So now they're...  You had to hear them go,  oh, you want a war against...  You know, they're blaming these kids.  These kids didn't do it.  I did it.  All right, I'll take a war with you fucking idiots.  All right?  What are you going to do?  You're going to keep me off of TV?  So they go after these kids, right?  And they go, oh, you want a war?  And we're listening to them on not one funny line in 40 minutes.  How about the here's a war? 
[02:10:30]  You're a fat fuck.  Your wife is an unfunny cunt,  and your breath stinks.  I said that.  Jim Norton and Rich Voss agreed.  Yeah, I agree.  Here's the word.  Why don't you have a war on weight,  you fucking buffet molester?  All right?  Stop eating.  You've been kicked out of every major market.  You fucking can't make it.  You sucked in New York.  You sucked in Philly.  You got booted out of Buffalo.  How's that?  The guys from out to lunch are not saying this,  although I'm sure they agree with it.  Oh, I thought you were talking about opening Anthony.  I thought you were really yelling at T-T.  Yeah, now we're going to have a problem. 
[02:11:00]  You want a war?  That's what they said.  A small radio show like that.  Yeah, two guys that are making like fucking under 20 grand a year.  You want a war?  What are you going to do?  You fucking jerk offs.  All right.  We should lighten it up.  Let's talk about Hotel Rwanda for a few minutes.  Yeah.  I want to back up, actually.  I love the machete scenes.  Yeah.  I want to back up because Dave stayed at Voss's.  You've got to walk the listeners through Voss's place.  You've never been there, right, Ant?  No.  It's like I go there.  It's a bunch of antiques.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  First off, you have to go to the garage to get to his house.  There's no front door or nothing.  You go to the garage, and it honestly looks like the cement is cracked, and the water runs  down the cement.  He's very proud of this place, by the way.  You think, how good can this get once you get inside?  And you're horribly disappointed.  Really?  Yeah.  And then there's the wall of shame, which, come on, you even, you've got to admit.  Wait.  He has the worst memorabilia.  It's horrible.  I got some good stuff.  He's got stuff from shows he wasn't even on.  It sounds like it would be good stuff. 
[02:12:00]  Why don't you do a fucking cribs at my house, and we'll see.  Explain the Woodstock photo.  I mean, everyone knows Voss was one of the comics at Woodstock.  I hosted it.  It was taken from a helicopter.  He's got a picture of himself.  He pretty much, like Dave said, he has to circle which person is him on stage.  And it's framed.  It's done with an Instamatic camera or something, one of the throwaways.  I'm sorry, Woodstock wasn't as big as your Asbury Park show.  But let me tell you something.  With 12 fucking drunks and 80.  At least I got a nice digital phone on me on stage. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, shut up.  All right, your fucking main guest was Jeff Norris, you fucking zero.  Okay?  But this is the original Woodstock.  Dickie Betts.  Dickie Betts.  Yeah, he couldn't get him on stage because he was beating his wife.  Well, that was the beauty of that show.  We got Dickie Betts the day after he beat up his wife in a hotel room.  You beat that?  That's a good fucking...  Way to go, buddy.  You are on.  That's a good poster of me at Woodstock.  It's awful.  And no one's brave enough to tell you. 
[02:13:00]  There's pictures of, like, celebrities and all he can see is, like, part of an arm around  them.  And then he points to that with the red marker.  That's his arm.  They're really...  You've got to admit, they're pretty bad.  You know what?  Do a crib's at my house.  Do it like you used to do and you'll see some cool furniture.  My house is...  It's nice.  Look, it's your thing.  You like the antiques.  Do you guys even do cribs on this show?  Yeah, we've done that.  Okay.  We do a video and then put it up on the website.  Well, if you want...  You should do it over there.  We'll do cribs with you.  Yeah, you can do cribs at my place.  I don't care.  I'm getting new windows in right now. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, you've got to see his balcony.  Of course, you can only do it one at a time.  I can't believe that you can't just add to that.  I mean, it's terrible.  It's a townhouse.  You can't start adding additions on a town.  You live in a fucking trailer with 40 acres.  I know that.  But you could do it slowly is what I said.  They're not going to notice slowly expanding the deck.  Like a square foot on it as well.  Yeah, exactly.  Just move it on out and cut the hedge out of there.  Because you've got to admit, it's really small.  Yeah, it is.  But I have two of them.  I have one on my bedroom.  It's like a windowsill.  That's how small it is, really. 
[02:14:00]  That's a valley.  It's pretty small.  You know, it's a nice place.  I'm happy.  It's a nice place.  I'm two miles from my kids.  I'm in the country.  I'm out by farms.  There's not a lot of, you know, gold teeth out there.  It's nice.  Everyone's goal is to just eke at living out so you can move away from the gold teeth.  That's what people say.  They go, do you live in a good neighborhood?  And what they're saying is, how many blacks live by you?  It's a code word.  Jesus.  Well, that's just truth.  It's just the political correctness.  You live in a good neighborhood.  Bright Eyes is going to write a song about you if you keep this up. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, man.  Who is it?  Bright Eyes.  You missed it.  It's an earlier bit.  Someone out there is laughing, trust me.  There's a lull right now.  Let's get back to Don and Mike.  When your boss talks to God, does God have to wipe his face off every two seconds?  I know when I'm on stage now, people are coming with, like, drop cloths like I'm a Gallagher.  See?  I can go after myself.  That's the kind of guy I am.  I don't mind.  That's very funny.  You're not allowed to read the message boards after your appearance. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I'm just going nuts.  And I wish he was dead.  Oh, I can't feed into these people.  Are they that bad to you?  Are they that bad?  No, there's a couple.  There's fans.  It's like anything.  There's some 16-year-old kids sitting around, you know.  Right.  But there's fans, you know, and there's not.  It's message boards.  You know, listen.  I don't go to the message boards.  I couldn't take that.  And I don't even spit on people.  By the way, we should mention you guys are going to be at Caroline's all weekend long.  Yeah, Bonnie, Dave, and myself.  Yep.  And Russman Eve.  And Russman Eve.  Yeah.  Bonnie, Dave, and myself. 
[02:15:30]  That's a really, really good show, man.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  You get to see Russ, and Russ is funny.  Tonight, tomorrow, and what?  Tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday.  Yeah.  Oh, tonight's Thursday.  Wow.  Tonight's Thursday.  Dave, what have you been doing after the show?  I've just been touring.  That's all I've been doing.  And I've been home for a month, so it's been nice.  I haven't done anything.  Just sat at home.  And your trailer with 40 acres?  Yep.  Where is that?  Like central Minnesota.  Really?  Yep.  That's where you live?  Yep.  Minnesota.  Just weapons and sitting on 40 acres, waiting for the...  That's some cold shit in the weather.  It is.  It's bad. 
[02:16:00]  It's bad.  I have seasonal disorder, so I haven't gotten out of bed for three weeks, because the weather's  been so horrible.  Like that depression?  Yeah.  I just lay there.  I can't do it.  I can't.  I went to his house.  He has rifles.  We went shooting, and he's got a fucking arsenal.  He's like a militia guy.  That's what I got.  And we're shooting.  Only I don't have a cause or nothing, so I can shoot at anybody.  Are you able to pull the trigger with those fingers?  Or do you have to grab with both hands?  I can take the trigger guard off and get those stuffy things in there. 
[02:16:30]  Let me go up in that lookout tower.  Yeah, the lookout tower.  Where the Asians shot the black eyes.  Oh, the deer stand?  Yeah, deer stand.  Are you close to that deer stand where that accident happened, or is that...  I'm about 100 miles from there.  Okay.  That's close up.  Accident?  Yep.  Yeah, there was no accident.  He just shot him.  Yep.  That was crazy.  Those Asians went nuts.  Yep.  Kicked him out of the ass.  It was from all the chives in their stores where they get mouth off.  They got even.  Nothing.  We're all thinking, how racist can we get with this one? 
[02:17:00]  I know, right?  Ben here yet?  No, no Ben.  All right, we got Big Kev's Star Wars audio.  Ooh.  I don't know if we're going to get to our stuff.  We'll try to get to our stuff.  What is that?  What is that?  Huh?  Nothing.  Big Kev.  Big Kev hosted a Star Wars event last night.  Sweet.  At 12.01 a.m.  They played the movie for over 3,000 fans, is it?  3,300.  Yeah, it's 16 theaters.  This is the new one?  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  And, yeah, so it was just loaded with geeks, with lightsabers, and stormtrooper uniforms.  And we got some audio from, I guess, some of the revelers.  Yeah, Kevin went around and interviewed people here.  Here we have a couple of young Jedis.  And what's your guy?  Oh, God.  A couple of young Jedis.  Here's a couple of young Jedis.  That they come dressed as the characters is just the worst. 
[02:18:00]  That's true.  And that he sounds like Ed Sullivan is even more irritating.  Come here, son.  Young Jedis.  Here we have a couple of young Jedis.  And what's your guy's name?  Walter Reyes.  Chris?  Reyes.  Oh.  You're another Reyes?  You're brothers?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, I see.  And you?  Spencer Ross.  Spencer, uh-huh.  And you guys are wearing some sort of prefabricated Jedi robes and carrying sabers.  Very nice. 
[02:18:30]  And let me ask you a question.  How old are you guys?  19.  14.  19.  Uh-huh.  And have you been told that you will not get any girls wearing these costumes?  Yes, plenty of times.  That's not true.  I just made out with a girl two minutes ago.  Her name is Princess Leia.  Made out.  Yeah.  I saw her, and I think it was Prince Leo that you made out with.  Oh!  Maybe to you, because she knocked you out. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Thanks for that.  Uh-oh.  Can you put some Don and Mike on?  Wow.  When he said he was 14, did you try to get him in the car?  Did you play your ice cream truck music that you have in your car?  All right, well, that's the first clip.  He's just warming up.  I think he's pulling some Jedi mind tricks on you.  You will be uninteresting.  These questions will stink. 
[02:19:30]  He's out there in the field.  Here's Big Kev talking to a nine-year-old, Anthony.  Oh, this should be good.  Oh, this is cute.  This should be good.  Kids say the darndest thing.  All you can hear is, shh.  What's your name, mister?  Cory Perrone.  How old are you, Cory Perrone?  Nine. 
[02:20:00]  And how long have you been waiting in line?  1,900 million years.  1,900 million years.  Cory, let me ask you this question.  How old are you?  Nine.  Nine years old.  You're seeing a movie that starts at midnight.  Yes.  Do you have school tomorrow?  Yes.  Do you know what Dyfus is?  Yes.  Yes, you will.  It's in your future, my friend.  You have fun.  All right, buddy?  I know Dyfus.  I am Yoda. 
[02:20:30]  Very good.  I like to write the questions down and then proofread them.  I like to find out if they'd be interesting or what the responses I might get from them.  Right.  Run through them and kind of think what might come back at you.  Yeah, what might come back.  Yeah.  Well, I don't like to be critical.  Track three is all ready.  I look forward to the magic continuing.  Thank you.  Hey, where'd you guys get that coffee?  That's not the type of coffee we drink around here.  Boy, that's not good, is it?  Rock and roll belly.  Hey, kid, this wasn't 20 bucks. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  He wants his change, Ricky.  Wow.  Keep five for yourself.  Really?  Yeah, buy yourself something.  Something nice.  Five bucks for the radio show.  He's got menus and wow stickers, but he doesn't have your change.  Rick, where's his change?  He's got it.  Rick's not a thief.  There you go.  Quit shaking.  God.  Let me see your nails today.  I swear to God, I feel like I'm getting it.  Let me see your thumbnail.  Don't drop that dollar.  Please pick it up.  What are you, in the Muhammad Ali story?  He's a nervous kid. 
[02:21:30]  He's a wreck.  Go buy yourself something.  Oh.  Did you just tip him an intern?  You don't tip the intern.  Give me a pen.  You're insulting.  No, he's going to get it back from him as soon as this thing is off.  It's not like he sold your Mercedes.  I know what he was like.  What, did you get a little sandwich?  Yeah.  You're the fattest thing I've ever met.  You're a nibbler.  All right.  Rich, I would love to tell that story about your money, but I won't, because I promise  you I wouldn't tell that story.  You ever hear the Meals on Wheels story?  No.  Oh, what a jerk.  What's the money story? 
[02:22:00]  I can't tell.  I promise I wouldn't tell.  Rich.  I can't tell.  Rich, I'll tell you the Meals on Wheels story.  Let him tell.  I'll tell the Meals on Wheels story.  I can't tell the other story.  I made a promise, and I'm a stand-up guy.  Can we hear about it some other day?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Some of these listeners will leave us alone, because they'll harass us for the next year  until the story comes out.  I know, I know, but that's one of my favorite stories.  I just can't tell it.  Isn't it bad?  Didn't we tell it on the air?  What?  Is that the story about his mom?  On the Meals on Wheels?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You probably heard that one.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  I think we have told that one.  Maybe you have told that one. 
[02:22:30]  Not all the money he makes?  Hold on, you've got to retell it.  Well, basically, his mom wasn't doing so well, so his sister called and thought, you know,  we should get him some help, and Meals on Wheels is like 80 bucks.  And this idiot stops and actually goes, could I get that?  Yeah.  It's 80 a week for all that food.  80 a week.  He wants to get Meals on Wheels.  Who thinks about that?  I mean, his mother is ailing, and he's worried about it.  You're not home anyway.  Wow.  I'm just saying it's a good deal.  So is Goodwill.  Yeah, you ought to go to one of those boxes and just pull clothes out. 
[02:23:00]  You just take stuff out of them.  They've got Ben Sherman.  Yeah, they've got nice suits.  I put a lot of stuff in those Goodwills.  I know you do.  Yeah, see homeless guys walking around with Voss Sucks t-shirts.  Yeah, and they're looking at it going, this font is horrible.  I don't appreciate the font.  I may be drunk.  Actually, you know, to be fair, a lot of people want the Voss shirt.  Do they?  Yeah.  RichVoss.com.  Yeah, like you can't make your own.  RichVoss.com.  That's the sad part.  With an old shirt and a printer.  The simplest thing.  Exactly.  They're supposed to come up with a design that they can't. 
[02:23:30]  Something you can copyright, not just letters.  Right.  Well, they needed some iron-ons, and they're ready to go.  That's all right.  Jesus.  It's a whole other meaning when I send it out.  I'm sure it is.  Let's go back to Big Cab's Star Wars interviews, Anthony.  Big Cab is going to put his head down like, oh, I don't think it's going to get better,  do you?  No.  We should bet on that.  Is it going to get better?  Yeah.  He talks to four chicks here, so this should be some hot conversation.  Amongst this sausage factory, there are four lovely young ladies. 
[02:24:00]  And what's your name?  Alicia.  Swamini.  Colleen.  Alice.  And Alice, which is not her real name at all.  And how long have you girls been waiting in line?  Actually, only about a half an hour.  Yeah, half an hour.  And you're all really excited about the big Star Wars movie, are you?  Yeah, very excited.  And why are you excited?  Well, because I really, I love all the movies, and I really wanted to say it. 
[02:24:30]  Are you aware that you're like one of the hottest girls on the line?  Thank you.  Wow, you're trying to.  I just want you to know.  And how does it feel to be, you know, pretty much out amongst the geeks, as it were?  Oh, it's great.  I love it.  Geeks.  You're not the geeks.  No, really.  You're not the geeks.  You have to trust me on this.  You're not the geeks.  He's trying to pick up this.  The only thing that would make this interesting is a Bill Curtis narration of how they were found 
[02:25:00]  in a shallow grave in their house.  And it shocked the city.  They were just going to the movies.  They were last seen meeting with a nine-year-old.  I can't remember the kid's name, otherwise it would have been funny.  They continued to watch the movie, and then went with Big Kev over to his house.  They were found wrapped in a Voss Sucks T-shirt.  And then he carbon froze them.  Powerplay?  Not in New York.  I wish I could do a Bill Curtis. 
[02:25:30]  He's such a great guy.  Bill Curtis is great.  I was watching the show last night, and as I'm listening, I turn to my girlfriend and  go, you know, when you hear his voice, you know it's not going to be a good story.  This is just not going to be about, and they lived happily ever after.  It's just going to be pedophiles and death and murder.  Can you imagine being one of his kids?  Son, you're going to need to come in here.  Oh, no.  Mom's dead.  I walked in and found Mom's bloody corpse.  Scrawled on the floor. 
[02:26:00]  Her headless torso was...  Mom, Dad!  It seemed to have been sexually assaulted, but I wasn't sure.  You're right.  There's nothing good coming after Bill Curtis.  Nothing.  You hear that voice, you just know you're going to see some kind of horror on the screen.  Love those shows, though.  Let's see if the interviewer gets better here.  Can I say that...  They're sides, though.  I just want to say this one is actually captivating.  Really?  You're captivated.  That's good.  I'll see if I'll make you guys.  How many guys have hit on you ladies so far this evening?  Counting you?  None. 
[02:26:30]  Five.  Five?  You lost count.  How many of them had lightsabers?  And I mean the plastic toy kind.  Oh, out of the seat.  You have to feed out of the seat.  Nice.  All right.  You guys have fun.  Oh, dear.  In what can only be kismet, Anthony with the graduation Jedi robe.  And what was your name again?  Alicia.  They actually know each other and are hugging and kissing on the line. 
[02:27:00]  This is a spoof on interviews, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people here.  That's really disturbing.  I'm a computer door.  What can I say?  I really do.  Unbelievable.  I'd like to thank Eric for giving me a dat recorder with dying batteries.  This is a clue.  Too bad.  They weren't too bad.  They were not soon enough.  They weren't dying.  They weren't dying.  They were killing themselves.  Let's arc out.  Who's with me? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, well.  You know, that's the thing about an interview.  Were you really captain of it, or were you just trying to be nice?  Blame it on the batteries, sure.  What's that, Captain?  Blame that interview on the batteries, dying.  Jesus.  Hey, the batteries make me sound uninteresting.  No, he's saying, Captain, there's a guy that tells me to fuck off.  Oh, all right.  All right, so he's good. 
[02:28:00]  I heard they're playing that tape on Nambla's website.  That's a good line, all the young guys.  Yeah, I thought it was a good line.  That was a good line.  There's eight people that know who that is.  I'm one of them, but I thought it was funny.  Ah, wow.  Let's go to Floyd in Georgia.  Floyd, what's up?  What's going on, Owen?  Hey.  I'm so Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, Rich, I just got one thing, man.  I want to hear you say fucking filibusters on Thursday.  Fucking up.  Filibusters on Thursday.  Fucking up.  See, that's not what I screw up, dummy.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  You don't have any S's in there.  All right, here we go.  Big Kev, outside Star Wars, talking to black folk.  Oh, okay.  That's another angle.  I have found a couple here.  And what's your name, sir?  Tony.  Koyan.  Tony and Koyan.  Let me ask you this, Tony and Koyan.  I'm looking around.  I'm looking around at some 3,000 or so people, and you two really sort of stand out. 
[02:29:00]  Why is that?  You don't want to mind.  We represent Philando, Calrissian, and Mace Windu.  So, you're saying that you're black people.  Absolutely.  Uh-huh.  Are you aware that right now, by my count, including the two of you, there are five black people here?  No, I wasn't aware of that.  We thought we were the only ones.  Actually, we thought we were the only ones.  What prompts you to come to a theater... 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  ...that is predominantly this evening...  This would be better if you just slowed it down a little.  Exactly.  It's like the cadence.  Like to a dead stop.  It's uncomfortable.  What prompts you to come to a theater full of white folk in this, the year 1962?  There's black people at the theater.  If you'd done those interviews, would you have turned in the tape? 
[02:30:00]  No.  The batteries died before I even got there.  I didn't even make it to the theater.  It never would have made it back into the car.  No.  The tape would have been stepped on.  I would have said no one showed up for the premiere.  Yeah.  No one shot.  No one showed up.  I don't know what happened.  I think you guys had the wrong movie time.  You're riding Kev too hard.  I sense a big laugh coming in this one.  All right.  I think it's the...  All right.  I absolutely do.  The big finish.  I do.  That is predominantly, this evening anyway, serving, let's say, shall we say, white people. 
[02:30:30]  We live close.  We live pretty close to here, so...  Well, the Star Wars, we're all family, so it doesn't matter.  That's very galactic of you.  Thank you, sir.  Very galactic.  Do you have any final words for the other African-Americans standing in the line?  Represent, may the force be with you.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Have a good time.  No, you have a good time.  No, you have a good time. 
[02:31:00]  I hear there was a problem later on, and we have a cup of Kev.  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  You sound like Slim Pickens.  No, you have a good time.  That could be a catchphrase, Kev.  I was just thinking he's going to try and make that his catchphrase.  You're going to see it on t-shirts, just like bosses in a couple of years.  No, you have a good time.  It's always good when you say let's say, and then you follow it up immediately with shall 
[02:31:30]  we say, let's say, shall we say, say, let's say, shall we say, oh, I am so safe on the  boards tonight.  Wow.  Yeah, it's almost like they brought in a ringer.  I know.  Be kind to Vosner.  Do the kids online.  Let's do a really uninteresting interview so that Vos doesn't get his ass handed to him  wearing.  Oh, big Kevin is smashing you.  He's huge, by the way, he's huge, and he gets you a lot faster than me.  Did you notice anything on this line? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, you have a microphone.  No, you have a good time.  Hey, listen, I'm just going with the flow here.  We enjoyed it.  I don't know why you had to pick on it.  Here's a guy that tells Kevin to fuck off.  Uh-oh.  What's your name?  I had to edit this audio.  My name's Dennis.  Dennis, how are you tonight?  Pretty well.  Dennis, I stopped to talk to you because I noticed a couple of things.  One, you're reading a book.  What is that book?  The book is a visual dictionary of Revenge of the Sith. 
[02:32:30]  The visual dictionary of Revenge of the Sith.  Uh-huh.  And what is a visual dictionary to Revenge of the Sith?  I really couldn't...  In your own words.  I couldn't...  I couldn't precisely tell you.  It was on sale in the lobby of Barnes & Noble, and I had a lot of time to kill.  It seems to be a collection of close-up photographs of visual elements in the movie, different characters and stuff.  Are you aware that this book is designed for five to seven-year-olds?  Uh, I actually kind of got that from the, um, design, but basically, uh, it seemed like it would be the least immersive book just standing on a line with people. 
[02:33:00]  And so, based on the fact that you knew it was a kid's book, you bought it anyway, I'm presuming because of the pretty pictures.  Uh, what's this for?  XM Satellite Radio, sir.  Oh, okay, that explains the smart-ass attitude and the stupid look on your face. 
[02:33:30]  Why don't you go fuck off?  Okay, thank you very much, sir.  Wow.  Whoa.  You took that!  Wow, confrontation.  You took that!  Wow.  Why didn't you pull out your lightsaber and have a little sword fight with him?  Yeah.  Not the lightsaber in your hand, either.  Waka waka.  Wow, waka waka.  Wow.  Hmm.  That's it.  Hey, will you guys let me do an interview at, like, an insurance seminar?  I can make it wacky.  Yeah, give me some fully charged batteries.  Well, I don't want the fully charged ones in case it goes wrong.  I don't want to hear that. 
[02:34:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  That guy's pretty interesting, though.  That was, yeah.  That guy told you, Kev.  You know, you went out there and you were out there.  You sure did.  Was it followed up with, come along, mother?  Let's go to Chuck in Ohio.  Chuck?  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, Green Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Chuck.  Hi.  I don't know what we've done to make you guys mad at us as listeners, but we're sorry.  We really are.  We don't deserve this punishment anymore. 
[02:34:30]  Wait.  Now, did you not like the interviews?  Uh, no, I love them, actually.  All right.  Have a good day.  All right.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug.  Doug Out Doug.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, Kev.  I wanted to congratulate you on graduating from the Bruce Kelly School of Interviewing.  Oh, he kind of did sound a little like XM's own Bruce Kelly from the 80s station.  I'm actually surprised we got that whole thing without you actually referring to Episode  3 being the interlocular. 
[02:35:00]  Very good.  All right, Doug Out.  Thank you.  We have another clip here, Anthony.  Wow, there's another one.  Yeah, more clips, Kev.  All right.  Only a couple more.  He talks to an ugly chick, Kev.  Uh, it was a chick dressed as Princess Leia.  Princess Leia.  Dressed as Princess Leia.  After this, I got some other interesting audio.  There's, um, like some outtakes from a wiretap between two dentists.  All right.  What's your name?  Devin.  And where are you from?  Kearney.  And Devin is wearing a lovely Princess Leia get-up. 
[02:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  Did you make this yourself?  No, I didn't.  I bought it, like, eight years ago.  Halloween costume.  Came with the wig.  Nice.  And she has the bread roll hairdo happening, and, uh, she's quite the looker here on the  line, and she's getting a lot of looks from the young gentlemen who are walking up and  down the lines, searching out the young ladies, all six of them.  I'm the only lady in a costume.  I'm the only lady in a costume.  You may be right.  I haven't seen a lot of ladies at all, let alone in costume. 
[02:36:00]  Uh, how long have you been waiting?  Um, since about, hold on.  Since about five o'clock?  No, six o'clock.  Six o'clock.  That's not bad.  Six hours for a movie waiting on line.  That's good.  Not bad at all.  Have, uh, have a lot of the geeks been coming up to you trying to get the phone number,  the digits, or, you know, whatever the Star Wars equivalent is?  Not really.  I think they're pretty intimidated, actually.  I've been taken, my picture's been taken, though, by a lot of people. 
[02:36:30]  Of course it has.  Actually, some hecklers up in the front told me to get out of here, because I wasn't in  this one, and I said, if you know anything, you know I am, so, as Leia, of course, you  know.  Certainly.  Jeez.  Four dead D batteries were found in her anus later that evening.  We're not even looking into this case.  This is who cares, cold cases. 
[02:37:00]  Who cares?  Who cares?  The police just threw their arms up and went home.  Did the fun ever start over there?  The files sat in their office for over 20 years, where they will probably sit for 20 more.  There were actually other cases written on the back of these cases, because they needed  the paperwork.  Don't whisper.  Why are you whispering, Rich?  Why are you whispering?  You can't do the impression.  Of what?  You can't do the impression?  What impression?  Whatever they're doing right now, I can't do the impression. 
[02:37:30]  Why couldn't you have given them the signal?  Anyone does a bad Bill Curtis.  Yeah, go ahead.  Do Bill Curtis.  Do Bill Curtis.  I'm doing a bad Bill Curtis.  Just give it a shot.  Go for it.  Do it again.  I'll do it.  Oh, yeah, because mine was so dead on.  It's just putting on some kind of an air.  Yeah, it is.  I'm Bill Curtis.  Come on.  Just say, I'm Bill Curtis.  No.  Look at him.  Come on.  What is Bonnie saying to you?  Don't do it.  Oh, you'll do your act on here, but not this?  I didn't do any of my act.  I didn't do any of my...  Oh, there you go.  I didn't do any of my act.  Just say, I'm Bill Curtis. 
[02:38:00]  I'm Bill Curtis.  That's not bad.  Here we are.  People died at the interview.  We should have left it at just Bill Curtis.  That's good.  You're doing so well.  I'm Bill Curtis.  That's good.  Yeah, that's good.  That's pretty good.  Really?  Yep.  Oh, wait.  Should I turn around first and fix my hair and then do the impression?  This will be his opener for Caroline's all week.  Giving him a little bit of encouragement.  You know what?  I should do other impressions.  No.  That was good.  I'm Bill Curtis. 
[02:38:30]  And I got too much.  I went over to Caroline.  Bill Curtis.  Bill Curtis.  And I suck.  I heard a little part of it in there.  Cadabra, you've come back to me.  Guys, we have one more clip.  Ooh.  The last clip.  We break it up into two so it sounds like two more clips.  Big Kev talking to gay guys online, right?  Ooh.  How's this one?  I don't know which one this is.  Of course not.  She just brings it all together. 
[02:39:00]  This is just his own personal recording, that's why.  What's your name?  My name's Anthony.  Anthony, where are you from?  I'm from Rutherford.  Rutherford.  Anthony, I can tell by your attire that you obviously have just graduated some higher education today.  Oh, wait.  No.  Is that a Jedi robe?  That is correct.  Uh-huh.  And how old are you?  I'm 16.  Uh-huh.  And did anyone tell you that you will not get laid wearing this robe?  No.  Not in the last couple of minutes, no. 
[02:39:30]  Not in the last couple of minutes?  You're not going to get laid wearing this robe.  Well, that's too bad, I guess.  And is this your boyfriend?  What's his name?  No, no, this is my friend, Jeffrey.  Jeffrey?  Jeffrey.  And are you from Rutherford as well?  Yes.  And why are you guys waiting in line?  Because we're diehard Star Wars fans.  Nice.  I understand that part of it.  The waiting together and the gown, I don't understand.  But the rest of it I'm with you on.  What's that?  That's extra.  And where's your...  It was his idea. 
[02:40:00]  The whole gown thing and waiting together is his idea.  You know.  I'm just going to park it.  You know.  Don't leave the way.  Yeah, that really sucked, dude.  All right, cool.  We'll have fun waiting in line.  Okay, terrific.  How do you know when there's the out cue?  Like, how do you know where to end these?  I just see.  Like, there's no...  There's the out cue.  You imagine the barrel of a gun next to your head.  And then you go, that's it.  Blew out Opie's hand.  I'm like, as you're editing this, whoever edited this, as you're editing, do you wait 
[02:40:30]  for a certain spot to cut it and say you're done?  It's a pause.  I guess whenever they wake up, they just hit the button.  How do you turn a Star Wars premiere into like a porno interview?  How old are you?  14?  Are you going to get laid in that outfit?  I usually wear pants.  It just didn't quite work out out in the field there.  He was trying, though.  No, I think he tried really hard, and I'm looking forward to his next work.  Absolutely.  I've had more laughs watching Meet the Press. 
[02:41:00]  That's Bill Curtis.  Not Bill Curtis.  No, I screwed up.  What's his name?  Tim Russert.  Yeah, Tim.  I am Tim Russert.  He's a good-looking guy.  I'm Tim Russert.  I'm Tim Russert.  That sounds just like him.  That's pretty good.  Do Tim Russert.  I'm Tim Russert.  We're here outside of Star Wars, and a man is being handcuffed and thrown into a police  car right now.  Well, who's Tim Russert?  I don't know.  All right.  She's a different guy.  Hey, Bonnie, you have anything to say over there?  No.  Are you enjoying your fiancée?  Bonnie has two black eyes, hence the glasses.  Yeah, what's with the glasses? 
[02:41:30]  Are you beating her up already?  She's reading for a role with Greta Garbo.  You know, it doesn't matter, because you guys are fucking setting me up, because there  are good lines.  No.  You did a Greta Garbo reference.  Oh, my.  Listen to me.  What, at 75?  Who gets that?  Oh, that's the other one.  You should never have said that.  We're talking.  This is a year ago.  We're in a rental car.  We're talking about hot chicks.  I'm talking about some honest, modern-day ones, like... 
[02:42:00]  I don't believe you're listening to that.  Exactly.  He brings up Gina Lola Brigida.  Gina Lola Brigida.  From, like, 1943.  She was hot back in her day.  Of course she was, but we weren't anywhere near that.  Gina Lola Brigida.  And he made the noise, like...  Like that.  Hubba hubba.  It was crazy.  It was...  You really, seriously, you have some problems.  I like old stuff.  I just bought three pairs of PF flyers online. 
[02:42:30]  Three pairs of tennis shoes.  And I'd rather fuck them than Gina Lola Brigida.  What was she in?  Huh?  What was she in?  She was online at the Star Wars interview.  She was in a million things.  She was in a couple of movies, honestly, back in 1940.  You never heard of her?  She's very famous, but no one has thought of her in 30 years.  Heard of her, yeah.  She's been dead for 30 years.  Like, I think they made a reference on the Flintstones about how hot she was.  Yes, exactly.  They called her Gina Rolla Rocketa or something like that. 
[02:43:00]  Exactly.  It was hitting with the whole Flintstone thing.  And now somebody over here can jack off to Hanna-Barbera.  You know what I'm saying?  Someone mentions lipstick lesbian to go with Eleanor Roosevelt.  She was a handsome woman.  That's great.  All right, well, the guys are hanging with us today.  Rich Voss and Jay Mordal.  Can I play your first thing or no?  Yeah, we'll play a little of that when we get back.  How does that sound?  It's so embarrassing.  These guys are going to be at Caroline's all weekend long with Bonnie and Russ...  Rush Meneve.  Rush Meneve. 
[02:43:30]  He's very funny, too.  It's going to be a great show.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Caroline's.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F. U. Life.  Yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to all you non-union fucking truck drivers out there.  If you're not a teamster, you ain't fucking shit.  So why don't you guys all fuck off and get a real life and a real job?  I just want to put a big fuck you out there to Howard Stern.  You big nose-happin' asshole. 
[02:44:00]  Fuck you, Howard Stern.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big-ass you to this dumbass that's riding around with his left blinker on for 10 miles.  Then take the fucking right into a one-way street.  Fuck you.  I'd like to send a fuck you out to all the people that tell me my job stinks.  I'm a septic driver.  I drive a septic truck.  I suck up your poop.  I know my job stinks.  So here's a big fuck you.  Yeah, I'm going to throw a big-ass you to the freaking douchebag that just called complaining 
[02:44:30]  because Opie and Anthony and Jimmy are ripping on Star Wars in front of a 10-year-old kid.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  All right, we got Rich Boston studio. 
[02:45:00]  Dave Mordell.  Bonnie.  And some hot chick. 
[02:45:30]  Huh?  That's my friend.  Oh, this is satellite.  It's in Minneapolis, huh?  Yeah.  It's a friend I met here in New York.  Oh, cool.  Not your best gal?  Ah, it's my personal assistant.  Oh, there you go.  Yep.  Very nice.  All right.  She's younger than I am.  Yeah.  She's younger than my daughter's.  I know.  She's 23 and a half.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a good age.  Yeah.  A little bit like him. 
[02:46:00]  Mature guy.  I don't know what that's.  Yeah.  Mature gentleman.  Older gentleman.  Yep.  Stately.  Yeah, exactly.  Just keep her away from her dad.  If she works things out with her father, you'll never see her again.  That was Rich Voss that just said that.  Well, somebody here.  Finally a good one.  Uncle Bassey on Instant Feedback said, Voss is so archaic in his references.  At one of his Chicago shows, he actually made a Dobie Gillis reference.  Oh, I did?  And wondered why only three people got it.  What was that?  Dobie Gillis reference?  What was that? 
[02:46:30]  Drift Away.  No.  Wow.  No, that's not Dobie Gillis Drift Away.  Oh, that's Dobie Gray.  That's Dobie Gray.  All right.  Dobie Gillis.  It was Dobie Gillis.  It was Dobie Gillis.  It was Ferguson from the show.  That's the show that Gilligan was on before Gilligan's Island.  Yeah, with Maner G. Krebs.  Yeah, Maner G. Krebs.  The statue sat out front like this.  Yeah, it was a stupid show.  You want to update your act.  Next time you go to Chicago, mention the old Mrs. O'Leary's cow thing.  Probably got a big laugh.  I guess anybody remember that?  That was a big fire and everything.  I got that St. Valentine's Day thing. 
[02:47:00]  I guess if I would have said Dobie Gillis slipped into diseased, then it would have been hip.  Exactly.  It said Dobie Gillis.  I like old references.  If they get them, then they're fucking, you know, I like them.  But you got to realize, everybody in the audience is like 25, 30.  That doesn't matter.  Even if they're 40, they're still searching for it.  Nobody's talking about Dobie Gillis.  You got your Lenny Bruce.  It was on for a season.  I got my Lenny Bruce.  Why?  You can't play it in here.  What are you going to play it on?  Making reference is from the labor of his era.  I got my Lenny Bruce when I was on American Dreams playing Lenny Bruce.  My Oscar nominating, my Emmy nominating performance.  How about that Dumont Network, people? 
[02:47:30]  I got an old kinescope I want you to watch.  I also got one.  Now, this one's a little scratchy.  You can hear Thomas Edison in the background.  His walk-on music is, hello, my baby.  Hello, my darling.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Mary found a little lamb, its fleece with light as smoke, and she's dodging me.  You want to buy a cotton gin door? 
[02:48:00]  You're dead.  Hey, up in the balcony, why aren't you laughing, Lincoln?  Oh, what a loser you are today.  Do they know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa?  No.  Oh, that was...  What?  When he tries to write new stuff, he never researches anything.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  So he did...  We were on tour.  He did this joke.  Remember when France didn't want to enter into the war? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, no.  Yes.  So, honestly, he goes, I don't want France in the war, because, you know, everything they build...  How did that go?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Anything they build...  Oh, no, it was reconstructing Iraq.  That's what it was.  It was that France couldn't be involved, because they weren't in the war.  He goes, I don't want them building anything.  They're tower liens.  Oh, my God.  We let him do the bit for three shows before we told them.  And I go, no, it's in Italy.  And he goes, yeah, Italy, France. 
[02:49:00]  He thought Italy was a town in France, like the capital.  Oh, that's so stupid.  Classic.  Here's the best.  He goes, well, how come people were laughing?  I would be howling.  Of course they're laughing.  Hey, Bonnie, get on the mic, man.  You can be on here.  Come on.  You are.  Jump on the mic real fast.  Your black eyes aren't going to hurt your voice. 
[02:49:30]  Well, when we were in Edmonton, there was this, you know, maybe 20 Native Americans sitting  off to the side, and he looks over, and he goes, oh, Asian girls.  I love Asian girls.  Oh, no.  And the audience is laughing, because they all go, oh, and start laughing, because they  know he's wrong.  Right.  And, you know, it's like this weird energy in the room, and everyone's laughing, and he  thinks he's killing, so he just starts doing Asian girls just one after the other, and it's  getting, you know, ridiculous. 
[02:50:00]  And I'm running, like, I didn't know what to do.  I was saying, I was like, oh, my God.  That's horrible.  There's nothing funnier when he's messed up.  Oh, yeah.  He is the ignorant know-it-all.  He is the ignorant know-it-all.  That's a great term for him.  What did I say about the band that was on?  Oh, Annie Lennox.  Oh, one day he goes, we were listening to the radio, and he goes, who is this? 
[02:50:30]  Do you know who this is?  And I go, yeah, it's Annie Lennox.  He goes, it's the Arrhythmatics.  It's the Arrhythmatics.  You are classic.  You really are.  I mean, I just love it.  You couldn't write anything that stupid.  You can't put it on.  No.  No.  Oh, is that great?  Wow.  God, that was hilarious.  Italy.  Their buildings lean.  Yeah, their buildings lean.  Yeah.  Why are they laughing then? 
[02:51:00]  Because you're an idiot.  You're an absolute moron.  Completely laughing at you.  Exactly.  You got GED recipients in the front row going, no, that's not it.  That's not France.  One time on stage, what did you call it?  The Toosami.  Instead of Toosami.  Toosami?  Yeah, like they were killed by a love letter.  Toosami.  Why that letter hurt everybody?  I got bit by a big wave, and I'm in a palm tree. 
[02:51:30]  I love you.  Toosami.  Toosami.  Go ahead.  Go ahead and defend yourself somehow.  No, here's the thing.  You got a bad encyclopedia?  I got a lot of street knowledge.  That's what I got, you know?  From growing up.  I know a lot of shit about the street, you know?  And how much has that helped you lately?  You didn't understand that lean cuisine, you called it lean cuisine. 
[02:52:00]  We called it lean cuisine.  Let me just say that he's got sensual intelligence.  Oh, hey, look at that.  There you go.  What does that mean?  You know, she thinks she's so uppity because she reads all the time and everything.  You know, on the train she's reading, and the reading's overrated.  Yeah, it's the comprehension that you should pay attention to.  It's not a big deal.  It is a big deal.  I'm a good dad.  Dude, all that matters is that you're doing a show.  And you get street smarts. 
[02:52:30]  And the crowd is applausing.  It really is.  Applausing.  They're applausing.  Did he say it twice, too?  They were applausing and applausing.  I couldn't believe I just heard that.  I'm like, this has got to be a...  I'm like, what?  He goes, they were applausing.  Applausing.  Cool.  Can you get applause?  Yeah.  So he's just pluralizing.  You know what makes this a great country?  Somebody with your handicaps making it to your level.  That's what's amazing to me.  The beauty is that he talks for a living.  That's the most amazing thing.  The only thing you have is your words, and you get them all wrong. 
[02:53:00]  It really is.  And you've still made it.  Kind of a comment on the American school system.  Yeah.  You taxed him.  It's so horrible.  Don't be.  This is some new music, as far as resistance.  Is this what the kids are listening to? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, excuse me.  But he can still find out where he can buy a lid of grass on the street, apparently.  Mr. Streetsmart.  Yeah, John in New York City.  What's up, John?  What's up, boys?  I've got a question for you.  You grew up in Jersey, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what kind of street knowledge did you get to grow up in suburban New Jersey, you tool?  Listen to me, you fucking homo.  I grew up in Plainfield.  Plainfield.  Where are you from?  Where are you from? 
[02:54:00]  I grew up on the Bushwick Ridge of the Border in Queens.  That's where I got street knowledge.  I would get my aunt to take my Puerto Ricans all day.  Well, that's because you're a pussy.  I grew up in Plainfield.  I grew up in an all-black neighborhood.  Plus, they grew up in a bad neighborhood, sir.  And plus, listen to me, dummy.  I would cop crack on 168th Street, taking trains up to Harlem by myself.  You're going to tell me about where you grew up in Queens?  Please, put a cock in your mouth to get high and talk to me.  You can watch out for about 168th Street and all.  What is that?  Well, excuse me.  Let's backtrack. 
[02:54:30]  Do what to get high?  I'm just saying.  I didn't do it.  But you know what I'm saying.  You go to almost any length.  And you go up to these places with guns pointed at your head.  And it doesn't faze you.  And you're going to tell me, oh, I grew up getting my ass kicked by Puerto Ricans?  Please.  I got nothing.  Goodbye.  All right, boss.  Gross from Oklahoma City is saying he's remembering back to a few episodes of Tough Crowd,  where boss had such gems as people in Brazil speak Brazilian.  And he talked about the parlay floor at the old Boston Garden.  And I forgot, I slipped up on that. 
[02:55:00]  I knew that one was parquet, but I kind of, I was so excited.  The Brazilian thing, I just saw that again.  It was me and Rich were like political debating or something.  And I said Portuguese, and then he said Brazilian.  And Colin goes, you know what really annoys me is that he just said Portuguese,  and you repeated it and said Brazilian.  He talks Brazilian.  The phones have exploded.  Let's go to Rick in New Jersey.  Rick, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I saw a boss in Vegas last week, and a lady fell asleep during the show. 
[02:55:30]  She did.  Came up to him after the show, and she says, I'm sorry about that.  Boss is out.  Oh, that's okay.  It's happened before.  That's it?  Wow.  You know that show was a killer.  That was worth a phone call.  Hey, boss.  How about when Jay Moore was in the studio, and they had you on the phone,  and they were trying to get you to rip Jay Moore?  Yeah.  So what are you saying?  How about it?  I'm not going to rip Jay.  He's a good guy.  He's a friend of mine.  Don't you have something on Jay?  What are you, fucking FBI?  What are you, Hoover?  He wears pants. 
[02:56:00]  He's always wearing pants.  These guys came up.  I didn't even tell him, Seth.  What are you, the FBI?  What are you, Hoover?  We're not after Dillinger here.  What are you, a G-man?  Dumb shit, you lousy screw.  I'm not talking, see?  Hand me that chopper.  I didn't even catch that.  He's talking to Vosley like he's one of the coppers. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Big jigs up.  Let's go to Chuck in Texas.  Chuck.  Morning, guy.  Morning.  You guys are just a riot.  Hey, I got a comment for Rich Vos.  Oh, here we go.  Rich, you are the modern day Norm Crosby.  Oh, thank you.  Is that a compliment?  No.  You bet it is.  He made a living out of mispronouncing words.  Yeah, but he had to write them down and then mispronounce them. 
[02:57:00]  Rich does it on his own.  He was deaf, too.  Yeah.  Or he was deaf.  Isn't he still on?  We saw him recently at the Trump roast.  At the Trump roast.  Oh, it was awful.  He didn't go on.  Did he go on?  Oh, yeah, he went on.  It was so bad.  He used everything with joke jokes.  Like, you would have a joke about two Jews walking into a bar and he'd go, you know,  Donald's really good for the city.  He owns a lot of bars.  And speaking of bars, and he would segue into some awful old joke.  Oh, speaking of Donald, I am taping The Apprentice tomorrow.  You are?  Where?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Somewhere in New York. 
[02:57:30]  What do you have to do for The Apprentice?  You know, I guess for the fourth season, some kind of, you know, whatever.  You're not supposed to be giving stuff away about the episode.  Oh, you're right.  Good point, Dave.  Thank you.  I didn't give it away.  I just saved you a contract.  You're right.  Wow.  You're involved in some way with The Apprentice.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Oof.  That was close.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you announce the winner of season four that hasn't even started yet?  I don't know.  All right.  Just a call.  It's just another primetime network thing I'm doing.  The American Dreams, a couple seasons of last comment. 
[02:58:00]  All at home can look forward to another mimeograph.  This is right off the cop here.  Dittos.  Dittos.  Exactly.  The blue one.  Ditto ink.  The blue ditto ink.  Still smells good.  I'm the butt of a lot of jokes today.  Yeah.  I know.  And it wasn't supposed to be about you today.  Yeah, but I really like you.  And that's the reason I do it.  All right.  We're all breathing now.  Well, if only we had another interview to listen to. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Well, we do have a couple of...  Well, we have a bunch of things we could go to.  We could either do Psycho Ex-Girlfriend phone calls.  I thought we were going to listen to your first show.  You guys are really putting that off.  I know.  We have.  You guys really are.  It is so embarrassing.  You know what it is?  Opie is doing the rock jock thing.  Because that's what he was doing.  He was doing the rock jock.  Right.  It was the first show we ever did together.  I was just a construction worker out on Long Island who did a few impressions and song parodies.  So I come on to the show, and I'm just... 
[02:59:00]  I listened back to this recently.  I'm too happy to be there.  Right.  I'm like, oh...  I really had to pound down a few beers and stuff, so I'm pretty hammered.  And to listen to it, I'm just...  I'm over laughing and just like...  This is so...  I'm just too happy to be there, and it's so embarrassing.  Did we hear some of it a couple of minutes of it?  I want to hear some.  I've never heard of it.  This is so cringy.  Was Voss on there doing his sprint joke?  No, this goes back like 11 years.  Voss was sucking cock for crack.  On 168th Street. 
[02:59:30]  I just used that as a term.  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah, whatever.  19 years ago.  Voss is like Yogi Berra.  Should we go to this?  Look at me, stolen some more.  Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  You?  What's up?  Go ahead.  Yo, dude.  I'm Voss, man.  You know, you pass down just like fucking Yogi Berra with his stupid fangs.  What's he saying?  What are you saying?  What do you mean by that, sir?  I didn't hear it.  You know, like Yogi Berra fucking, you know, when there's a fork in the road, take it.  Yogi Berra was well known for that kind of stuff.  For what?  I like how Opie just wrecks everyone's spot, though, on the call. 
[03:00:00]  Because the whole joke is for him to call up and go, hey, Voss, you like Yogi Berra.  Opie goes, let's go to Steve in Jersey who says Voss is like Yogi Berra.  All right, Steve?  Yeah, Voss, you like Yogi Berra.  All right.  Opie just ruins the guy's name.  Look at him.  He thinks you're talking about the cartoon character.  No, it's the guy in the baseball guy.  But what's he saying?  How am I like Yogi Berra?  Yeah, that's what he's thinking.  Well, he's in the Hall of Fame.  That's what he's saying.  I think he is, isn't he?  Yes.  Yeah, he's in the Hall of Fame.  He's a Hall of Famer.  I kill on stage. 
[03:00:30]  I'm smarter than the average mongoloid.  I kill.  Oh, she's just going for the coffee.  I thought she was going to slam you again.  She's hot.  She's funny, man.  We all acknowledge that your wife-to-be is hot.  She's funny hot.  And we got to see her boobs today.  That was a special treat for everybody.  Yeah, she did that for everybody.  You didn't see?  Oh.  Miss everything.  Well, she's a team player.  One time I did a tough crowd, and we had to do a message to the troops.  Oh, I remember that.  For the female troops, I flashed my breastises. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  But before I did it, I had to check them in the mirror in the green room to make sure  that I would arch my back properly or whatever.  And Norton was on the show, and he didn't know that I was going to do it.  He just walked by and saw me checking my boobs in the mirror.  I was like, I just do that before every show.  A little show prep.  Sad thing is, Norton had his nuts up around his belly button at the time. 
[03:01:30]  Look what I can do.  Show and tell in the green room.  See, they're not all killers.  No, they're not.  See, what happens?  You get greedy, and you wear yourself thin, and that's where I come in.  I've done the stuff you wrote.  That's all.  Oh.  I'm rubbing your glue.  I'm sorry.  That's very juvenile.  So I'd like to hear a little bit of this first show.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's just bitching on instant feedback.  Just a little bit.  Stop it.  It is really uncomfortable.  I can't watch my own first open mic tape, so.  I bet.  It's just too cringe.  Boss showed his old tape. 
[03:02:00]  I showed my old tape.  All right.  Here we go.  We need an hour and a half with this stuff.  Oh, it's only here in a minute of this.  That's all a couple minutes.  Here we go.  It's a preview.  Ant and I doing our first radio show together, yes.  It's 11 years ago.  Close to 11 years ago.  Please just keep that in mind.  Rock Jock.  Oh, I can't even look.  It's going to get bad.  I can't even look.  Long Island's best rocked up with UBAB Soul Asylum. 
[03:02:30]  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from REM.  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  As you do the nighttime attitude, it's Opie aboard.  Thanks for checking out the program tonight.  And we've got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  We've got my pals Joe and Anthony from Rotgut live in the studio.  Opie.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Just in case people don't know who you are yet.  Yeah.  Well, oh, that happens all the time.  They are the famous authors of Gun Electric Shock OJ, which you're going to do live on the  show tonight.  That's right. 
[03:03:00]  And you're going to do other ditties.  Yeah.  Other wacky booty stuff, Opie.  I have to be putting on a voice every second I'm on the air.  I have to be over the top.  Oh, this is the worst.  It's just painful.  This is so uncomfortable.  What was wrong with that?  It was kind of like, hey, Opie, how you doing?  Oh, shut up.  You're too happy to be there.  You think I'm going to be able to hang up my wrench after this night.  That's pretty much what I'm thinking.  They're going, you know what, no one's going to make this work a maintenance man, you know? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, but you guys made it, so it's not that bad.  It's really not that bad.  Awful.  Let's hear more.  Yeah, I think that was pretty good.  I kind of like the music.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy's just wincing in the corner listening to this.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff.  We're a little bitter.  We gave Eddie better the idea to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what someone just said.  You know, they heard Pearl Jam's version of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, and they were expecting  to hear the OJ version.  He sounded like he was heavily sedated, Pearl Jam.  All right, I need a ruling. 
[03:04:00]  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity death watch.  Right?  Yep.  All right, you might have heard this.  You know what?  Hey, what?  In 11 years, you went from boring host to boring host.  Jesus Christ.  You're consistent, and that's very important.  Thank you.  Very horrific.  Stern will never say that you guys copied from the beginning after this.  God damn.  Can you rewind that just a little bit?  Are you sweating? 
[03:04:30]  I am sweating.  I'm sweating over here.  I'm all hot.  I'm sweating so bad.  It's horrible.  You're really sincere and genuine.  It's awful.  I hear like five seconds back, because you say something about the celebrity thing, and I think  you were smiling.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Shut up.  It's a great idea.  It's a great idea.  Wait.  Eat me.  I want to get the response.  He sounded like he was heavily sedated, Pearl Jam.  All right, I need a ruling.  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity death watch.  Right?  Yep.  All right.  You might have been...  Right?  Yeah.  Right? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Have another drink, you alcoholics.  Hey, when did it, like, change for you guys?  When we...  When...  I guess when we stopped really giving a fuck.  Yeah.  I guess when you started asking for rulings, right?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up.  God.  You suck.  Oh, he's pounding me.  Well, back then we still had to listen to bosses.  Right.  So you had to do all this stuff.  I wasn't even employed.  I'm sure that somebody put you up to this. 
[03:05:30]  Well...  I wasn't even employed by the station.  I was just a guy that was coming in and off the street.  Uh...  Kind of like Voss.  He's not.  Right.  Just...  I had street smarts.  And I was coming in just hoping to make something of it.  He wouldn't fix appliances for air time at the studio.  He was the maintenance guy there.  He was not.  No, he wasn't.  I was...  Oh, that's a better story.  You went from maintenance guy to satellite radio.  Air conditioning and heating.  I installed air conditioning ductwork.  Yeah.  But not at the station.  And then I had a band.  Oh, fair time.  And then I had a band that did song parodies. 
[03:06:00]  So I came in and what I was trying, like, my dream and goal was to get on the air  full time and make a living of it.  So any time I was on the air, I was so happy, happy to be there, that I was so over the  top.  And it's just awful.  Right?  Yep.  Shut up.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  I like...  Can I hear that question?  No.  I actually like that part.  I think it's a nice chemistry.  No.  Stop it.  This is a...  I can't think of it.  All right.  I need a ruling.  I started a new bit yesterday. 
[03:06:30]  Celebrity Death Watch.  Right?  Yep.  All right.  You might have heard this last night.  Monday, Jessica Tandy, the old broad from Driving Miss Daisy died.  Hey, I'll take that contract.  How old is she?  How old is she?  How old is she?  All right.  I can't.  I can't.  No, no.  It's really good.  It's really good.  That was a good one.  Shut up.  She's dead.  You'll take the contract.  You'll take the contract.  I get it.  I can see what they saw on these two right out of the chute.  Absolutely.  What the hell were they thinking?  No, I think it's really good.  This is so bad. 
[03:07:00]  I can't.  Hey, it's opening in the air conditioning, guys.  How did that not come up?  I like that.  You got to go do those different...  Make little train jokes or carrier.  I'm six minutes away from walking off this show, man.  Maybe your compressor's broken.  But hey, pink.  Bruce Kelly is laughing at us.  I like the agreeing, though.  You guys make Don and Mike sound like...  Fuck!  I forgot this show name.  It was supposed to be good for you.  Yeah, but what to say about the other guys that are out there? 
[03:07:30]  When you were a maintenance guy, and now you have your own show.  I mean, that's amazing.  That's really amazing.  Way to look at it, Dave.  Way to look at it.  Ant is so cloyingly happy to be there.  He's like one of the Jews in Schindler's List.  I invite her to the war effort.  Well, you guys don't need to hear anymore, right?  I'd love to hear more.  I'd want to hear some more of this.  This is good stuff, because back then, this was over the edge, over the top.  Take that contract.  Like, how old is she?  It's 85.  Oh, please.  Anyways, I don't know about you, but I've always been under the... 
[03:08:00]  Celebrities die in threes, basically.  Always.  Always, right?  So it's the celebrity death watch.  I guarantee two more prominent celebrities will die before October 1st.  So we're just waiting and watching.  Celebrities die in three, but radio hosts die in two.  I like the stuttering that you brought into it.  That was good.  Everybody knows celebrities die in two.  Oh, my God.  No, I really liked it.  I'm sure.  I really liked it.  I want to find a hole to bury it.  I really enjoyed this. 
[03:08:30]  You should sell this CD.  It's already on the internet.  I'd like to hear a little more.  I would like to hear more.  I would really like to hear more.  Yeah, you've got to remember, this was our first show together.  Absolutely.  Our first show together.  No.  George Burns in the hospital the other day.  It was a close call.  Very close call.  But he got out of it.  98 years old.  He has, like, his brain is swelling.  And he pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see.  What are you, the lady for misery? 
[03:09:00]  Darn.  Did you shake your fist in the air?  Did you?  Wow.  This is very difficult.  You know, when this was taped, Gina Lola Bridget had only been dead for 22 years.  Darn.  This isn't fun when it's you.  Oh, this sucks.  Yeah.  Right?  I can't.  Darn.  Darn.  Got it.  The goofus in gallon hour.  Yep.  Right?  Good point.  Good point.  Shucks.  Darn.  Can we say shucks in the air?  Is shoot too strong a word?  Oh, we're in trouble now. 
[03:09:30]  We've P.O.ed the bosses.  The day after this is when Bob Grant got so angry.  I really want to hear more.  Well, that's all.  No, I want to hear more.  That's all I brought.  You've got to have an hour of that stuff.  Oh, come on.  Oh, really?  Darn.  I always wanted to see George Burns singing that extreme song.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  But he never does.  I turned back around.  You kind of said funk like the other word. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That was very blue.  That was George Burns doing Carson there.  I cannot even take this.  Why?  I mean, because it's just too embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  It's good stuff.  Did you guys use this as a demo tape?  Holy shit.  This is why you got fired in Boston.  Actually, we used a lot of this and two other shows we did to get our job in Boston.  No, fuck.  As a demo tape?  I'll try to find a demo.  I'll try to take over for it.  Really?  Terry Schiavo.  I can't imagine anyone listening to this and going, yeah, this is the show we want. 
[03:10:30]  Well, maybe that interview about the Star Trek convention is on just ahead of it.  Yeah, what happened was my batteries were dying.  That's what happened.  All right, well, let's start.  No, I really, actually, I mean, for 11 years ago, it's pretty good.  Yeah, yeah, no, I know.  Maybe now after he's bopped on the head.  But I need a ruling.  I got an obituary.  Patrick O'Neill, 66.  People are going, Patrick who?  Now, I said it has to be a prominent celebrity.  This guy was in Stepford Wives, 1975. 
[03:11:00]  What do you think?  It's on the fence.  Is he prominent?  Let me see, Joe.  What do you think?  I rule me.  No, no.  All right, so it's still one with two celebrities to go.  Two weeks from now.  Two to go.  Two to go.  All right.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Rod Cut about the Cuban refugees.  Right?  There was a, Billy Joel made a tribute to the Baymen.  Right.  And we figured, you know, why not go to the other southern half of the states and make a little tribute to the Cuban boat people?  I can't even stand listening to this. 
[03:11:30]  I like the music bed playing underneath it.  Oh, there's got to be music bed playing in the background, right?  I don't know what that is.  That's the law.  How do you cash the paycheck?  How did the four fans keep up with all those rulings?  How many rulings do you do a day?  I need another ruling.  I need a ruling.  Oh, he's residing over the show.  He's not going to figure it.  I know.  I need a ruling.  He should have had like a gavel that would come down.  Too late now.  That was 11 years ago. 
[03:12:00]  I bring you news from the north.  Opie needs a ruling.  Yes.  I bring you news.  The Opie and Rusty Burrell Show.  Here's your ruling.  Get off the air.  What are you, Judge Wapner?  But it ain't.  I want to hear more.  I really enjoy it.  I like hearing all this stuff.  I'm going to go on break.  I need a ruling.  How many people think...  You know something?  What?  In all the years we've been doing radio, and I've been in the barrel quite a few times,  and this is the worst ever.  Yeah, you shouldn't have even brought this up. 
[03:12:30]  You should never have brought this up.  It's not even bad.  Shut up, Jimmy.  It's really bad.  Jimmy is wincing and laughing at him.  I have often wondered what George Burns would sound like singing a song, and thank God I  finally know, because he's an old codger.  He's going to be able to sleep tonight, finally, Jimmy is.  Oh, 85.  Sign me up.  There's about 10 people to rule.  Let's take a ruling on how good this is.  I'd like to hear more of it.  I really would.  Some people are speculating that in 11 years, even Pat from Unaki has a statement.  of having a radio career.  Darn.  Rich Voss and Dave Mordell at Caroline's all weekend long with Russ and Bonnie, and that's 
[03:13:00]  tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday.  Back to the tape.  Where am I?  It doesn't matter.  Back to the tape.  Just talk a little bit more of it.  I'm telling you.  This is good.  I am in Washington, D.C., and Dallas in June.  This is going to be a cliffhanger.  It's a cliffhanger.  O.P. and Anthony, XM202.  You don't have to worry about me, but I did order a dresser. 
[03:13:30]  Thank you.  You did?  Thank you, yes.  Breaking news on the O.P. and Anthony program.  A dresser?  I, I...  Where have you kept your clothes up until now?  On the floor.  Are you kidding me?  No, man.  Stop it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I can't even believe this.  Hold on, Sally.  Okay.  Your, your clothes have been piled up on the floor.  Are piled on the floor of your room.  Anthony, I...  How long have you been there?  Uh, three years.  Three years you haven't had a dresser?  No.  What is wrong with you?  I just, like, live, I live differently. 
[03:14:00]  I, I can't, I don't know what it is.  Differently?  That's differently than, than anybody in this country.  I like being kind of, uh, I, I like having the feeling that I'm like a free spirit.  Free spirit, and I don't know, free spirit, I did...  Like you're squatting?  I finally got, like, a CD slash DVD rack, too, because all my CDs and DVDs were just kind  of thrown around the living room, you know.  On the floor.  Yeah.  I have a...  Aren't you afraid?  Now, I know, look, I know you got a nice, uh, apartment, very nice area. 
[03:14:30]  Ooh.  Aren't you afraid that you're gonna put your pants or underwear on and, like, maybe a roach  or a rat, uh, a mouse turd or something is gonna be in there?  Mm, not really.  No?  You don't care?  No, not really.  That would freak me out.  I've been wearing the same jeans for seven days.  But I'm not smelly or anything.  Hmm.  You know.  All right.  I have good hygiene.  Good hygiene.  I have good hygiene.  How did you, now, where did you buy this dresser? 
[03:15:00]  I'm fascinated.  Just around, uh, around my neighborhood.  You didn't find it out on the sidewalk.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've been buying nice stuff.  Yeah.  It's just, uh, been a very slow process.  I don't know.  Very slow process.  Three years.  Three years to get a dresser goes beyond a slow process.  Yeah, that's beyond a slow process.  I understand.  I'm getting it together slowly.  Wow.  Yeah.  I am stunned that you just kept your clothes on the floor.  I get them cleaned and all, and then I just pile them up nice. 
[03:15:30]  That's all.  You know, and then when you, you need to get dressed, you just, like, look through the pile.  You don't have, you know, I have it, I have it kind of organized, you know, shirts, jeans.  Yeah.  In piles?  Yeah.  In piles on the floor.  Yeah.  Do you have a bed?  A really nice bed.  It's a nice bed?  Yeah.  But is it just a mattress on the floor?  No, no, no, no, no.  It actually has a headboard?  No.  Are you insane?  You don't have a headboard type bedroom set?  I have, I have the mattress and the box spring and the little, uh, little, uh, you have 
[03:16:00]  a metal frame?  Yeah.  That the mattress and box spring sits on and that's it?  That's it.  You have no headboard?  It's not important to me.  No night tables?  No.  Where you take your change and put it out and your watch and put it, this is stuff human  beings do.  Yes.  But it doesn't bother me.  Where's your alarm clock?  I know you say you don't need it and don't use it, but where is it?  No, I do need it because of the new hour.  I, uh, it's on the floor.  It's on the floor.  How high up is your bed?  Because I know my bed is pretty high up. 
[03:16:30]  It's really high because I got the extra mat, you know, the extra whatever pad and stuff.  Can you see the clock from your bed?  No.  Of course not.  You're living like a homeless guy, shacked up.  I know, it's cool in a way.  It has that college feel to it.  College feel.  But really nice stuff.  Bag of marshmallows in the room just in case you really want that college feel.  But really nice, really nice stuff though.  I got a really nice, you know.  Nice stuff what stuff?  Sound system.  You need stuff to have nice stuff.  I have stuff. 
[03:17:00]  I got couches, a leather chair.  I got some nice things.  I would think.  I bought a $500 piece of art, so I'm starting.  How?  Not art though.  Art's smart.  How about a bed?  It's just, I have a bed.  A really nice bed.  Having a mattress on that stock metal frame that you get from the mattress company.  I understand with a box frame.  Oh, you want to just decorate it up nice.  No, it serves a purpose, a headboard.  It has like drawers and stuff in it. 
[03:17:30]  And little sliding compartments.  I can't be bothered with that.  I don't have that either.  No?  I have a frame.  I have like a metal frame around it, like a metal headboard in a way.  Oh, that's nice.  I've seen those.  There's something like that, yeah.  My headboard has like cabinets on the sides of it, so let's say I have some Joey Butterfuco  pants for walking around the house in, and some t-shirts in there.  You get out of bed, it's right there.  You open up the little drawer there.  I can keep my DVDs that I like watching in the bedroom over there on the side. 
[03:18:00]  How do you live with just a mattress box spring on a metal frame?  I don't have a TV in my bedroom.  You have no TV in your bedroom?  No, because I want to be here, Jimmy.  No, but it's simply because I'm such a bad sleeper that they said, only sleep in your  bedroom and it'll make it a little easier for you.  I got you.  Yeah, some people, I'm not going to bash you for that.  Some people just don't like having TV in your bedroom.  No, I don't like having, no.  It would be cool at times, but no.  No.  I don't really have room anywhere in my room.  I'm just, a dresser.  You finally got a dresser. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it comes Friday.  Comes Friday.  It's going to be a little weird, yeah.  Where'd you get it?  At a place around my hood.  Oh, just like a furniture store in your neighborhood?  Yeah, it's a nice dresser.  It's whatever.  Yeah, it's whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  Three years.  I know, it's weird.  Is it a wood dresser?  Yeah.  It's nice wood?  Dude, when I do buy stuff, I don't buy cheap stuff.  Yeah.  The problem is buying the stuff.  Yeah.  You know, I spent like, I don't know what I just said, but about $600 on a really nice 
[03:19:00]  photograph.  Yeah.  That takes up half of my wall and stuff, you know?  So when I do finally buy stuff, I don't go cheap, no.  You stack clothes on it?  You're painting?  It's a picture slash table.  Wow.  All right.  I got a can of pledge now for the wood.  Oh, well, the maid does that.  No, she does that.  Housekeeper.  And then she tells me what I need, you know.  She'll point at stuff like more.  Now it's more work for her.  More this, more that, you know. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, congrats on your dresser.  Thank you.  That's a big move.  Three years.  Thank you.  Hey, this is Ridge Voss from Last Comic Standing, season one and season three.  And I was also a judge on season two.  You are listening to Opie and Anthony.  So I got a, I got a, uh, an apartment update, Anthony.  Ooh.  Uh, yeah.  Another fun thing happened to me in my apartment this morning.  More wildlife, is it?  Uh, well, thanks for getting right to the punchline.  I really appreciate it. 
[03:20:00]  It's really, uh.  Sorry.  It's really going to help my story.  I was just throwing some out there.  It could have been a Java log.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thanks.  Oh, well.  No suspension left to this story.  Well, I, I, I, I, I.  Remember my brother the other day when he was passed out of my couch after his colonoscopy?  Uh-huh.  You know, and the mouse was running around?  Right.  And I finally caught that mouse later that day after he left.  I told the whole story on the air.  That's what I was referencing.  It'll probably be replayed over the weekend. 
[03:20:30]  That's what's cool about the weekend shows on 202.  It plays all the shows from the week.  Right.  So you could catch up in one day or two days.  Yeah, you really don't have to listen to the show during the week.  I hate to tell people that, but you could, you could catch up on a Saturday and Sunday.  They just run it in order, right?  Yeah.  So you'll hear that story over the weekend.  But, um, uh, he woke up from a daze and saying, you think there's only one mouse in this apartment?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And that thought's been in my head the whole time.  So every time I go into my, my really cold kitchen, that is blocked off from the rest of the apartment 
[03:21:00]  by a door, kind of.  I have to open that door.  And I'm always just like...  No heat?  It's really cold in there.  I mean, there's a heater and stuff, but that, that's why this door is up just to kind of,  you know, I don't really need the, the kitchen being like kind of a bachelor dude.  So, you know.  Right.  No cooking going on.  Not really.  I mean, a little bit here and there.  So, uh, so, but every morning or at night even, I'm opening that, and just waiting  for something to be on the counter again or something, like the last time. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  And I swear, every time, just like, oh God, please, please, you know.  Sometimes making noise, just in case there is, it could just scurry away.  And you don't have to see him.  Right.  So, uh, this morning, I go downstairs and I'm on the computer as my coffee's brewing.  It's 4 a.m.  I'm ready for a, ready for a fine day of radio with my pal, Anthony.  There you go.  Time to check the headlines, read a little email.  Start of a new day.  See if the Hot 97 crew got fired yet.  Right.  See if we're in the paper today. 
[03:22:00]  You know, all the fun stuff we do every morning, right?  And then I'm like, ah, the coffee's done.  Ah.  Do, do, do, go upstairs, all happy, you know.  Just in my long johns, because I just, you know, rolled out of bed, no shirt, no socks.  Ooh.  Which I'm, it's kind of key to the story, though.  That's the only reason I'm saying it.  So, uh, so I'm like, ah, coffee, you know.  And, and yes, I did go in there and start the coffee maker.  And then I just closed the, the door.  So I'm thinking nothing of it, all right?  Apartment's pretty dark, because my eyes are still adjusting. 
[03:22:30]  Do you do that in the morning, by the way?  Uh.  I have all my lights on dimmers.  And I keep it really, really low when I first wake up.  And slowly but surely, it's almost like the sun's coming up in my apartment.  And I, I, as, as that hour goes by, I'm like, turning the lights up, turning the lights up more.  No, I'm not that calculated.  No, it's not even being calculated.  I mean, you know, when we first started doing, uh, morning radio, that bright light first thing in the morning in the apartment would kill me.  It would go right through me.  Yeah.  I try to keep it pretty dark, I think, yeah.  Yeah, so it's pretty, so it's still very early, so the apartment's very dark with just slight dimmers on it so I can get to the, excuse me, the dark kitchen. 
[03:23:00]  So I'm all happy, and I, eeeeh, open the kitchen door, right?  That's a little oil, huh?  I'm getting ready to reach for my coffee cup, and I hear my garbage pail.  Whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee.  Rustling?  Really loud rustling.  Really loud rustling, and now it's dark in the kitchen.  I'm there, and I'm like, oh, my God.  The first thought was you describing a subway, New York City subway rat. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  This is loud rustling.  I'm like, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whew, whee, whee, whee.  Was the pail moving at all?  No.  Wasn't jumping around.  That would have helped the story, but no, I'll tell it how it is.  No.  I should have said that.  But you heard it.  No, I heard it.  No, and the rustling was very loud, okay?  And I just had, like, I didn't have a garbage bag in there because I just emptied the garbage last night  because that's my new thing is emptying garbage every day, just keeping all food out of the apartment. 
[03:24:00]  But I forgot I had a little snack or whatever last night, so I had a little grocery bag, you know,  with a couple things, and that's it, at the bottom of the garbage.  So it was in there.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And I'm thinking how you were describing these nasty New York City subway rats.  They're the size of cats.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  My heart went up into my throat again.  Yeah.  Now I have to turn the light on.  I'm like, oh, God.  I turn the light on, and I look into the pail, and sure enough, it is just, you know, rustling.  I think it knows I'm in there now, and it's now just trying to get out, but it's kind of, like, you know, tangled in the bag, I guess. 
[03:24:30]  I'm like, holy ass.  Now what?  So now I'm ready to be just the biggest wimp and just run away or kick the pail and run and let it just hide.  But I'm thinking, this is my opportunity to get another one of these things out of my apartment.  True.  He's already trapped.  So I'm like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  So I pick up the little pail, and it's in there, and the rustling is really loud.  I'm like, this effing thing is going to jump out of this freaking pail.  Oh, it'll be jumped out right on you?  Oh, that's what I'm thinking. 
[03:25:00]  That's what you think, right?  It's going to jump right on you.  Which would literally, I'm not even kidding.  I think I would have a heart attack.  You'd just die right there.  I would have a heart attack, and I still don't know what it is.  I don't know if it's a mouse, a rat.  So, I mean, there's no real great ending to the story.  But, you know, now I have, you know, no shoes or socks on, just long johns, no shirt, and  I just grab my keys, and I'm just carefully, I'm carefully carrying this pail.  Like, I don't want to, you know, shake it too much because I don't want this thing to 
[03:25:30]  totally panic and get out of here, you know?  So I'm, like, carefully, you know, carrying the pail out of the apartment like it's a bomb  or something, you know?  I'm like, oh, my God.  Get outside.  Obviously, it's five degrees.  I'm freezing my ass off.  Now I'm, like, I need to know what it is.  So I just emptied the garbage, you know, right on the sidewalk.  You just dumped it out?  Oh, yeah.  Now I'm just waiting for it to make its appearance, you know?  And, unfortunately, there's no great end to the story.  And, finally, mouse number two.  Did you see him?  Oh, yeah, I saw him.  Yeah?  Mouse number two starts, you know, walks out of the, not walks, just finally, you know, 
[03:26:00]  runs out of the garbage.  So the first one had a friend.  And then I kind of chased it a little bit down the sidewalk because I'm, like, I got, because  you're an idiot.  You get these thoughts in my head.  You know, I remember you saying, well, maybe the mouse is going to come back into the apartment.  So I'm running down, not running, but walking, you know, following it down the sidewalk a  little bit as it's going over snow piles, looking at it like, is this the same mouse?  How would you know?  Oh, because I studied the last one because, remember, it was staring at me from the TV? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  And this one looked like it was smaller.  So I'm like, tell me there's just a bunch of mice.  There probably are.  And then you said in the office that when I was seeing the mouse, that one mouse, that  it was probably a bunch of them that I was seeing.  Could have been.  Yeah.  Maybe you weren't looking at one mouse.  It was probably, like, five mice in there that you're looking at.  And now you're going to see them.  You're a ground floor guy, so that's rough.  Well, here's the problem.  Ground floor guy, older apartment. 
[03:27:00]  I mean, it's a really nice apartment.  It's a real old building.  And they did a lot of construction to the brownstone next to me.  I mean, a lot.  Drives all the road and stuff.  Oh, I mean, where the whole, my apartment was shaking all summer long.  Yep.  So I'm thinking they, you know, they shook things up, which makes, you know, things want  to, like, you know, move on.  Yep.  So, obviously, I've got to get the mousetraps now.  You've got vermin.  Yeah, I'm not convinced that that's it.  I've got two of them out so far.  Are you going to get the humane traps or the ones that snap their necks off? 
[03:27:30]  No, F, no.  I want to hear that BAM in the middle of the night.  And know you got one.  Oh, yeah.  Then they all, they end up, it's so sick to look at the trap after that.  Sometimes, maybe they just got a leg.  Sometimes it's, like, right across their back.  And sometimes it gets their head and neck where it crushes it.  You don't want to look at that.  It's kind of horrific.  All bloody mouse head.  My brother told me what to do.  He says, get the mousetraps and throw them in bags.  Makes cleanup a lot easier, he said. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  Because he, you know, I told you, he used to live on the Upper East Side, way uptown,  where it was just nasty.  You get, like, a paper lunch bag?  Yeah.  And you put the mousetrap in there.  Yeah, with a little cheese.  He's, or actually, my brother, he's, like, an expert.  Because he used to live, I told you, he lived with his rugby pals.  What a great idea.  And they had rats where they, you know, they were so drunk all the time.  They were excited when they heard a rat in their kitchen.  They all just went hunting.  No joke.  So, and these are, you know, rugby guys that have to outdo each other.  So, of course, you know, they're not like me running away from a stupid little mouse. 
[03:28:30]  They're like, watch what I could do.  Yeah, exactly.  Just getting stupid.  Right.  So, but he says peanut butter works the best.  He goes, oh, it's peanut butter, mousetrap, in a bag, no problem.  Clean up is a breeze.  You hear the snap or you look in the bag, you see something furry.  Yeah.  You just roll the bag up, throw it away.  Done.  That is pretty smart.  Done.  Never heard of that.  Yeah, someone's saying I need a glue trap.  Now, that's...  Those are disgusting.  Yeah, because now the mouse is trapped all stringy with the glue. 
[03:29:00]  No, I can't look at that crap.  No way.  Ben, what's up?  They come under your door, too.  They can get under...  You have to get the thing.  I have them on my door.  No, no, no.  You just got to go to the hardware store.  You've got to block any room under your door.  Because I had one.  That's how he got in.  They flat out.  It's amazing.  Don't tell me that.  Are you serious?  That's all you got to do, though.  They'll never come back.  That's how they get it again.  You get a piece of metal weatherstripping or something.  No, there's something between my refrigerator and the counter.  There's a space.  Yeah.  Because I once saw a really big one. 
[03:29:30]  This is where it all started about a year ago.  I saw a big one.  And I think I brought it up on the show when we first started.  Maybe I didn't.  Or maybe I...  Because I don't know the difference between the radio show and just hanging out with it all.  I know.  We forget what we talked about.  We forget.  But it was when my brother was over with his family and left.  Oh, I told you all that with the stuff that all their food was laid out.  And I went in the kitchen one day and there was a big one munching on the trail mix.  And I freaked out.  I left so fast that I thought it was a mouse. 
[03:30:00]  But everyone was like, well, if you think you saw a mouse, it really means it's a rat.  But I saw the thing quickly kind of turn around and go between the refrigerator and the counter.  So that's where they're coming from.  Hole in the wall back there, maybe.  Probably something.  Yeah.  So I got to get my loser landlord that could care less about making his tenants happy.  You're going to have to raise holy hell and get him in there.  Call an exterminator.  Yeah, I guess.  Get him in there.  Professional.  So there you have it. 
[03:30:30]  Let's see.  Mike in Kansas City.  What's up, Mike?  Good morning.  Yeah, I just want to let Opie know that he should cover every crack and crevice.  Those mice can squeeze through a hole the size of a nickel.  Yeah, I've seen that, man.  It's pretty weird looking.  These mice can get anywhere.  If you think your house is mouse-proof, forget about it.  Well, you know.  Under the door.  I get the traps today.  Simple as that.  You know, eventually they're going to get the hint.  When they start smelling other mouse death.  Mouse death. 
[03:31:00]  Well, you know, these animals know that crap.  Mouse holocaust going on in Opie's house.  Yeah, hey guys, I'm punching out.  All right, thanks.  And then he put me out in the cold and let me sit here all night.  It was six degrees.  He didn't let me in.  Jeff in DC, what's up?  Paper bags with the corpses of my friends inside them.  Awful.  Yeah, pretty bad.  Go ahead, Jeff.  You're going to set these traps?  Hold on, hold on.  Sorry. 
[03:31:30]  You're going to set these traps?  I got to...  Roll tape, please.  I have to see you setting a mouse trap.  Why?  You know how nerve-wracking it is to set those things?  No, I could do that.  Oh, no.  He hit it right on the head.  You got to get an exterminator.  Why do you even want to deal with this?  Yeah.  I dealt with this once, and I got an exterminator, and I got the things fixed, and I never had  the problem again.  Yeah, they carried the bubonic plague in.  It's something behind the refrigerator.  God knows when they move that refrigerator.  Playing hide and seek. 
[03:32:00]  Something behind the fridge.  Dun-dun!  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, Opie, you got to get the green fake cubes.  The what?  They're green fake cubes.  They're poison.  Bate cubes.  Uh-huh.  You throw them behind your refrigerator, behind the stove.  They eat this stuff.  If they've got young, they take it back to feed their young, and they literally hemorrhage  from the inside.  And they die in the walls, and you smell rotting mammal.  That's what I was going to say.  That's why I don't think I could go the poison route, because now you've got the smelly dead 
[03:32:30]  corpses.  Dead mouse in your walls.  They're back in the wall.  You won't find it.  Yeah, you'll smell it.  Yes, you will.  Dead, rotting meat.  You've got to get them out of there.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  Punch it out.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  First of all, it's freaking cold out here.  I'm like an hour away from New York, and it's minus 15, so I'm going to make these five  degrees any time.  Where are you?  But mice, where?  Yeah.  I'm heading down Route 17, going towards Manuette. 
[03:33:00]  It's like an hour away.  Oh, my God.  It's brutally cold up that way.  Anyway, I had mice.  I used to live in Newburgh, and first of all, I'd hang out in the stove, right?  I actually had some food out there, and my girlfriend was staying over for the night,  and I came out downstairs, and the food's all eaten.  I accused her of eating the food, and she's like, I didn't eat the food, but it was a freaking  mouse.  So what you do is you take some coconut.  I know you don't get out to the store much because you're a bachelor and everything, but  if you happen to go past by a grocery store, grab a coconut.  Take a piece of coconut and toast it with a match, put it on the mousetrap, and guaranteed 
[03:33:30]  you'll have a mouse.  Guaranteed.  That peanut butter works.  Yeah.  All right.  What kind of scumbag are you that you're bitching at your chick for eating food?  No, she was bitching at him, right?  She made a mess.  I think he was bitching at her for taking the food.  Really?  Like, what, are you eating the food?  Dude, how much...  What, were you stranded somewhere?  And what...  How much did the mouse eat that you're bitching that your chick was eating it?  Is your chick anorexic?  Because, what, you're noticing that a tiny little dime-sized piece of food is missing? 
[03:34:00]  You get fat, I'm leaving, you bitch.  Right.  Would you have a scrap of bread, you bitch?  What an animal.  All right, I figured I'd share.  We don't have to talk about mice.  Mice.  You know, that's...  I hate mises.  But, you know, it's an update.  Mouse number two has been caught.  Yep.  And I just...  Now I'm convinced there's at least another one, if not more.  Good luck, you city bees now.  Good luck.  I adore the suburb.  You know what I see as far as wildlife? 
[03:34:30]  I'll see a little squirrel outside on my porch.  Or I'll see a bluebird in the tree.  Whippoorwill.  Whippoorwill.  Or then I look...  Oh, what's...  It's a little kitten.  Is walking on the porch.  I think I'm going to take him out a piece of my chicken I had today.  Yeah.  That's the wildlife I like.  I don't like city cockroaches and mice and rats cohabitating with me. 
[03:35:00]  I haven't seen the cockroaches lately.  I had a couple of those, too.  Oh.  But this is all normal stuff for a New York City apartment.  They scurry when you turn the lights on.  Yeah, it's a little...  So you don't see them as much as you would a mouse.  Yeah, it's a little creepy, the cockroaches as well.  You know what the worst...  When I was living in Brooklyn, man, I'd be on the computer, you're sitting there, and  then out of your peripheral vision, you just see something kind of move.  That's right.  Yes!  And you look, and stuck on your wall is a cockroach.  And the way they move, just...  They're so fast and disgusting. 
[03:35:30]  The little antennas moving around.  Oh, God, you can't catch them.  They're gone.  And they'll disappear into, like, your couch.  Or all of a sudden, they're gone by your dining room table.  You don't know where he went.  Might be under there.  Might be in between, where you put the extra piece in when family comes over.  Yeah.  You're just hiding in there, eating the gunk that collects in there.  Waiting to poke his head up during dinner.  All right, all right, all right.  Hi, big city cockroach here.  What's for dinner?  You have a... 
[03:36:00]  Disgusting mess.  You have a way of describing things, man.  I don't like them.  It is a true talent.  Thank you, Opie.  It really is a true talent.  When I lived in that apartment...  How many people could give me the heebie-jeebies about how you describe things, man?  I give it.  You ever play hopscotch walking down the street on a summer day where you're walking and all  of a sudden these huge cockroaches are just winging back and forth along the sidewalk.  And I'm not even talking about the ones you even see in your house, which are big.  But these things on the street, they're like the homeless cockroach. 
[03:36:30]  They're just these huge things on the street that are walking over.  We went out one night, me, my girlfriend, friends that included other girls and stuff,  and they're wearing these open-toed shoes.  And one girl actually had one walk over her open-toed shoe.  And a scream that you'd only hear in a horror movie just comes out.  And what happened?  I'm picturing, you know, a gang of five people with knives stabbing her.  No. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah!  Cockroach.  Oh, she didn't yell, what, are you going to shoot me?  Oh.  We'll get into that story next.  Tragic.  Horrific.  More animals on the street.  Really fast being that, one time waiting for a subway.  Yeah.  Rat bumped into me.  Bumped into you?  Swear.  You bumped your shoulder to shoulder?  Oh, sorry, pal.  Yeah.  No, I'm on the platform.  And just like you described, you know, sometimes these creatures get displaced and they start just scurrying as fast as they can.  Yeah.  Well, something was going on with this rat and he just, you know, zigging and zagging, you know, hit me in the leg and then jumped down onto the tracks. 
[03:37:30]  Wasn't going to take a nibble or anything, but just wanted to get to, you know, back into hiding or whatever.  Nope.  I don't know where it came from, but all of a sudden I just felt, boom, something hit my leg and I look and I just in time to see it kind of go over the ledge into the tracks.  I'll take a little raccoon in the suburbs.  You see your garbage pail rattling around a little bit?  You go to check it out.  What pops his little head up?  Oh, he's wearing a mask.  Look, it's a little raccoon. 
[03:38:00]  Our pests are adorable out in the suburbs, aren't they?  Little raccoon.  The ugliest thing you get is the possum walking around that looks like he's perpetually smiling.  Hi, I'm a possum.  I'm just going back to the woods.  Just came out for some of your suburban trash.  That's outside of your house.  Fine.  Take a little away with you.  Not these big, disgusting rats and bugs.  Yuck.  Well, we got a lot of phone calls coming in now, so should we...  They're giving me the heebie-jeebies just reading some of them. 
[03:38:30]  I know.  Let's go to Mike the trucker.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on this morning?  Hey.  I had a horrible mouth story.  We pulled a practical joke on a buddy of mine in college, and the end result of the practical  joke was because of mice that we introduced into his car.  He was the kind of guy that his car, you know, he always had a bunch of trash and, like, fast  food shit in the back.  All the guys that just throw it over their shoulder.  Please don't tell me this story, as with death.  Feeder mice, you know, that, like, people have snakes by them for food or whatever. 
[03:39:00]  He's forging ahead with the story, Opie.  Not stopping even for us talking.  That's fine.  Go ahead, Mike.  And, uh, well, anyway...  The listener's heard, and now they're waiting.  ...to find feeder mice and putting them in there, and, uh, apparently they were breeding,  whatever.  He was driving across campus.  One of them jumped up, like, on the headrest, and it scared the shit out of him.  He wrecked his car, and, uh, dude's, like, in a wheelchair.  He's paralyzed from the waist down now.  Nice.  Funny joke.  Damn it.  I don't have my laugh button today.  Yeah, well, you know, it, uh, like a... 
[03:39:30]  You know, the guy was a real cocksucker, so it doesn't matter anyway, but, uh...  Wow, that's really...  For a few minutes, we kind of felt bad about it.  That's a scummy thing to do.  All right.  Anywho.  All right, guys.  Punch it.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Let's go to Ryan.  Hey, Ryan.  Hey, Owen.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Make it fast.  We've got to take a break and move on to other things here.  Okay, man.  Um, I just, uh, had an apartment in Kansas City, uh, down by the plaza.  I used to, uh, uh, go downstairs at night, and I'd hear all this rustling around, you  know, so I know what you're talking about.  Oh, anyway, um, I set up, uh, these mice traps down, uh, mousetraps down by, uh, the kitchen 
[03:40:00]  and these great big holes I thought were, like, for pipes or something.  Anyway, the traps would be gone the next morning.  They'd be gone.  Uh, anyway...  The trap would be gone?  The trap would be gone.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's a rodent with attitude, man.  Oh, oh, oh.  So, like, the next day...  Someone's going to teach you a lesson.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Stealing the traps.  I tied, like, a wire to it and hooked it to the wall.  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  The next day, it was, it was in there.  It was in the, in the wall.  So, I pulled on this thing, and this dang chihuahua-looking leg was on there.  It chewed its own leg off.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, wow.  It was a rat.  Chewed his leg off.  And, uh, the one, uh, there was a morning when I went downstairs, I opened up the door  and I had, I had a dog, and, uh, so I had, like, the dog food and everything sitting  over there.  I opened up the door, looked in there, and there was one sitting on the dog food, eating.  And I look at him, I'm like, uh, excuse me, and I shut the door and I just walked back 
[03:41:00]  out.  Yeah.  Yeah, just leave him, let him eat.  You know, you can call me a wimp, whatever, but I guarantee there's a lot of tougher guys  than me out there that have been, uh, have been, uh, you know, scared S-less by, uh, by  these, uh, rats and, uh, rats and, and, and mice and stuff.  Never want to deal with them.  That's a good story, Ryan.  All right, punch it out.  Rat can't stay down with three barrels in him.  He's got a wire tied to the trap, and it drags it right into the wall.  Oh, my God.  He'd choose his own rat arm off. 
[03:41:30]  That is heinous.  All right, you know what, I'm not, I'm getting a hotel tonight, I'm not going to be able to  sleep in my apartment.  Oh, what would you do if you woke up and something was in the sheets with you?  Nah.  Nibbling at your toes or, nah.  Or just cuddling up for warmth by your feet.  Oh.  All right, my apartment's going to be a hundred degrees starting tonight.  I would lose my mind.  I can't have anything, like, even touching me.  You know, if something, if something brushed up against me while I was sleeping, I would 
[03:42:00]  lose my mind.  I would scream.  All right, let's get one more in before a quick break.  Jim in the Poconos.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I work for the phone company, and when we're in Lower Manhattan in downtown Brooklyn, you  can shine the flashlight on the wall in some of these basements, and the walls move.  Yeah.  I don't be in cockroaches, man.  Oh.  It's like, you want to talk about, it freaks you out.  That's what it comes down to is the easiest way to put it. 
[03:42:30]  Can you imagine sleeping, and you're sleeping with your mouth open, and a roach comes in  and starts feeding on your teeth and gums?  All right, all right.  Oh, and you wake up like, what?  And a big roach is in your mouth?  Oh.  I want to move on, but Chris has a story here.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, I'm a cop, and me and my partner got dispatched to a call about a raccoon in somebody's  basement, and we got there and opened up the door, and all of a sudden, this raccoon jumps 
[03:43:00]  out of me and my partner, and chases us out of the basement.  Chases you?  Scared the shit out of me, man.  I've never been so scared in my life, even on robberies and stuff like that.  You don't know what those things are going to do, and they will attack you.  They'll come running out after you.  Raccoons, yeah.  That's why you're just looking through your sliding glass door.  That's it.  Look, he's all cute.  Sometimes you get deer out there in the suburbs. 
[03:43:30]  You look out in your backyard, hey, look, it's BAMP.  Yeah.  Yeah, but those things jump through glass sometimes.  There's a story every year, a deer, you know, going through someone's glass.  Running at full speed into a sliding glass door.  And now they're stuck in your place, just wreaking havoc.  Bleeding all over everything.  There was a story this week.  Maybe we can find it, or someone can send it in.  That exact thing.  Oh, the old guy?  Yeah.  Inside the house, and a buck, like, ran into his house.  Yeah.  And started trying to have sex with him.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  This big buck was, like, grabbing him with his hooves and trying to have sex with him.  Do you have the actual story?  That was this week, right?  Yeah.  How did we miss a spy like that?  How do you go through life, and it ends up you're getting raped by a buck in your own home.  Ow!  Knocks him off as a little rascal.  Maybe he saw him on his rascal and thought it was another deer or something.  Yeah, all right.  It's horrible.  This concludes our podcast day.  You'll be an Anthony show. </pre>
