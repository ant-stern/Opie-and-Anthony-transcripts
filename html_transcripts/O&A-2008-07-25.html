<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a self-deprecating introduction emphasizing their controversial "shock jock" status, immediately launching into vulgar, sexually suggestive banter, including a joke about ovaries and a recounting of a previous interaction with a female caller that involved crude misogynistic remarks about her reproductive organs.  They justified this behavior as immature humor that never progressed beyond elementary school levels.  The hosts then discussed a producer's absence, hinting at a medical procedure, before shifting to a comparison of Barack Obama's large Berlin rally to John McCain's smaller Ohio event.  They speculated on Obama's global appeal, contrasting it with McCain's perceived lack thereof, and engaged in offensive generalizations about various nationalities, particularly Germans.  The discussion included media bias towards Obama, the unpopularity of the Iraq War, and the hosts' opinions on the upcoming election, along with crude, sexually suggestive commentary on Brooke Hogan and a brief, abruptly ended call from the Dominican Republic discussing HBO's "Generation Kill."  This was followed by more crude, objectifying descriptions of Brooke Hogan's appearance.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of UFOs and government cover-ups, featuring a clip of Edgar Mitchell discussing his belief in alien visitation.  They also discussed Buzz Aldrin punching a man who denied the moon landing, incorporating several callers and further vulgar commentary.  David Duchovny was announced as a scheduled guest.

A later segment focused on McCain and Obama's late-night talk show appearances, critically analyzing McCain's attempts at humor, particularly a poorly received "McCain Pirate" bit.  This was contrasted with Obama's perceived superior comedic timing and rehearsal.  Highly offensive language permeated this discussion.  The hosts then joked about executive producer Steve C.'s "mystery illness," similar to Anthony Cumia's, adding sexually suggestive and offensive comments. They promoted their upcoming comedy show with Greg Giraldo, sharing anecdotes of past shows involving excessive drinking and vomiting.  Giraldo joined the show in studio.  A clip of a female weather reporter being blown away by a hurricane prompted further crude jokes.  The hosts also discussed a news story about teenagers attempting a Gray Poupon commercial prank, which led to a man pulling a gun, and reacted strongly, using highly offensive and misogynistic language, to a news story about a jilted bride winning a $150,000 lawsuit, playing audio from a Today Show interview.

David Duchovny's in-studio appearance initially centered on the jilted bride story, then shifted to *The X-Files* movie and *Californication*, with sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts. They discussed Heath Ledger, *Brokeback Mountain*, and *Step Brothers*, expressing disappointment in Will Ferrell's absence.  They also mentioned their regret over a past interview with Philippe Petit.  The *X-Files* discussion covered the movie's standalone nature, Duchovny's experience reprising his role, behind-the-scenes anecdotes (including a nearly-aired scene involving Mulder, Sasquatch, and masturbation), and joking about Mulder's pornography habit.  Superfan Roland was in studio, receiving Lego and engaging in awkward exchanges with Duchovny.  The segment also featured a humorous anecdote about a *Californication* scene involving a hose and simulated female ejaculation.

Further discussion of the $150,000 jilted bride settlement included heated disagreement among the hosts and a lawyer about the woman's entitlement and legal precedent.  The show then aired footage and discussed a prank on Bobby Lee, resulting in a panic attack, involving a malfunctioning console, disappearing lights, and a non-existent rabbit.  The hosts apologized for not informing Lee beforehand.

A chaotic segment followed, revolving around a cockroach infestation in the studio.  Opie, Anthony, and Bobby Lee expressed disgust, organizing a "Cockroach Hunt" for interns and culminating in Cream Pie Jones eating a cockroach.  Bobby Lee's discomfort with the studio audience led to his departure.  Greg Giraldo recounted a near-death experience on a malfunctioning airplane.  Videos of Cream Pie Jones engaging in self-described filthy acts, including wearing a "doody hat," were played.  The cockroach discussion continued, with unsuccessful attempts to find videos of Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with dog shit.  The segment ended with Pat Duffy snorting dead baby cockroaches and E-Rock smelling Pat Duffy's anus, witnessed by a studio audience.  A news story regarding Kathy Lee Gifford's use of an Asian accent was also briefly discussed.

A final excerpt featured a rambling discussion about a Chinese woman rejecting traditional expectations, promotion for Greg Giraldo's show, and a planned synchronized viewing of *Back to the Future*.  This segment included sexually explicit and violent jokes.  A substantial portion was dedicated to "What's Up Eastside Dave's Ass?", a game involving guessing objects in Eastside Dave's rectum.  This devolved into increasingly vulgar antics, including a Trojan condom-based food challenge for interns, Eastside Dave exposing himself, and inserting a pill bottle of Valtrex (and later, urine) into his anus.  E-Rock fled the studio after interacting with the pill bottle.  The segment also mentioned sponsors (Trojan and Five Hour Energy), interns (Pat Duffy), a chiropractor who was the target of vulgar jokes, and the cockroach infestation.  Bobby Lee's earlier panic attack was mentioned.  The show concluded with announcements of additional segments, including another installment of "What's Up Eastside Dave's Ass?".

We already started the show, we're already laughing here.  Oh, God.  In the heart of New York City.  Good morning, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Occasionally, we just point out how despicable, as people, we really are on this program.  And during that little intro for the show  Little clips from a previous broadcast  We just start talking about how awful we are  Like I just blurted out  Hey man voice  To that woman  And then started calling into question  Her femininity  And her female organs  And whether they work or not  He just didn't like the show  So he attacks her reproductive ability 
[00:02:00]  We're horrible people  No I don't think so  I don't think so  I love it  Yes Jimmy  That's what you should have said  But it wasn't even disguised  Like a movie reference  That was like a schoolyard insult  Hey man voice  Yeah I could have covered it up  With some deep voiced woman  From the movies  Maybe like a hey Brenda Vaccaro 
[00:02:30]  Or something digging way back  But no  Just hey man  That's right  Hey ugly face  Hey big feet  You know it was just  It's just  Horrible  Elementary school playground  Crap we  Hurl out at people  That makes me laugh  Every morning when I  Oh I know  Hey grandpa  Give me ovaries  What she is  Is a woman  You know she's still listening though  Oh yeah 
[00:03:00]  After you get insulted like that  You gotta listen to that radio show  Sure  The reason the show works  Is because we never grew up  Yeah  We've kept it in the schoolyard  For the last  What  20 years  God  She had called in that day  Because she wanted music  I think  Yeah  She wasn't a fan  She didn't dig the show  And it  Oh yeah she wanted Tom Waits  Stump Ray remember  She wanted to hear Tom Waits  So immediately that goes  Until you should get a hysterectomy  She paid  With her female organs  It was just totally needless  I think it was perfect 
[00:03:30]  It really is just something  Yeah  We already got a call  From the Dominican Republic  On the line  What is that about  What  Also our  Our  Flusty  One of our 28 producers  Is out sick today  Yes  Not even sick  He's getting something done  And we can't say  What he's getting done  Yeah  Because we want to play  Something here  Uh huh  But if we tell you  What he's getting done today  Then we can't play the audio  We're about to play  Yeah  That's how dumb 
[00:04:00]  This business has gotten  So just try to  Remember when we were  Talking to Steve yesterday  I just think  That'll help  What Steve would enjoy  Getting done  Yes  The sounds of Steve  A little more 
[00:04:30]  All I can say is  This is why Steve  Is not here today  Builds to a crescendo  Sure  My amazing call  All we're allowed to say is  This is the reason  Why Steve's not here 
[00:05:00]  So let's keep it  Keep it above table  Holla back  Like the little holla back  On this next one  Wait for it  Wait for it  Uh huh  Uh huh 
[00:05:30]  Oh  And that's why Steve  Is not here today  I think we have more  On the way 
[00:06:00]  I think  I think  We have more  I hope so  Oh  Screaming  Uh  Well we were just  Talking about  Uh  We go from that  To Obama  Obama  Obama just talked  In front of  200,000 people  In Berlin  And as I look  At the picture  Anthony  Yeah  I don't see a lot  Of black guys  Well it's Germany  I understand that  I don't know  The racial makeup  Of uh  Many German cities 
[00:06:30]  I would assume  There are a lot of  Uh  European  Caucasian men there  Uh huh  And uh  Women  And he does seem  To be addressing them  A couple of brothers  In the crowd  You did point out  That it looks like  A Hitler solution  Yeah they got him  Waving  They got him from  Behind on stage  And uh  They're showing the  Crowd which is  Just enormous  Yeah  And uh  He's waving  But it really does  Look like he's  Kind of given that  Old Hitler  Heil Hitler  Thing  Uh  They probably  Did that on purpose 
[00:07:00]  There's plenty of  Pictures they could  Have gotten  But they got  That one  And uh  Wow  Does  Does the world  Just dig this guy  They hate Bush so much  And he's such the  Opposite of Bush  And they know  They understand  He's the first  Black president  People  People really do  Love him  And the whole world  Yeah this is  Something that  Um  Is worldwide  I think the world  Wants to um  Have  Have  The United States  Have a president  Like Obama  So  That  Things like  Diplomacy 
[00:07:30]  Can be used  Again  Not such a hard line  Let's send the  Military in  Immediately  More open  To discussion  Whether that's  A good thing  Or a bad thing  You know  I have my own  Opinions  Believe me  Uh  We believe you  Yeah  I am  I am one  Of the gun  You're from the  School of  Bomb everything  Bomb  And then ask  Questions  Everything  I don't think  They did enough  Uh  Bombing and hurting  People  To tell you the truth 
[00:08:00]  The war's been a little  Too sterile  And uh  Too many rules  Put on it  That was the problem  With Vietnam  Well  This thing with  Obama though man  Uh  What's weird about it  Is he's in Berlin  Talking in front of  200,000 people  We don't even know  Who the German president  Is in  In America  If the German president  Came to America  We  No one would show up  As far as I'm concerned  There's still only one  But it just shows you  How pompous America is  Yeah  Like uh  A presidential candidate 
[00:08:30]  Goes to Berlin  He gets 200,000 people  To show up for his speech  And if  If  If their president  Came to America  We  We  We  We would not show  Simple as that  Yeah  And I'm hearing  While uh  Obama's in Berlin  Talking in front of  Over 200,000 people  McCain was at a  German restaurant  In where?  In Ohio  In Ohio  Oh  That's the same thing  Yeah that's exactly  The same thing  It's so  I don't know  It's so lopsided  This thing  It's just  This guy is a rock star 
[00:09:00]  I can't tell  If it's the media  Really pushing him  Uh  Or  Or if this is the way  The vote is gonna go  Like I can't get a bearing  On that  What are the American people  The ones that are voting  What are they gonna do?  30,000  I'm sorry Mike  30,000 people  At some of these rallies  I know but that doesn't  What does that mean?  People like them  Does it mean  That those 30,000  Are voting?  I think a lot  Does that mean  A lot more people  Are gonna be voting  This time around  Well we'll see  I really know 
[00:09:30]  There was an interesting  Stat yesterday  That in the media  One to a hundred  Gave money  To Obama  Versus McCain  So out of every  Hundred media  Representatives  Who donated  To Obama's campaign  One is donating  To McCain  So there is  A slight bias  But the media  Won't ever  It's like  It's fine that they are biased  But it's amazing  How they all attack Fox  Who's biased?  But it's like  The rest of you are biased  It's like  Of course  Babies  It's alright to be biased  To the left  You just can't  To the right  Or else you're  You know  Crazy 
[00:10:00]  But this right here  Shows you like  Republicans are a little  Out of touch  At this moment  They're like  Republicans  Criticuled Obama's  Global appeal  And accused him  Of mixing his  Loyalties to the world  And to America  And it's like  No he's not mixing  His loyalties to the world  But you have to  You have to deal  With the rest of the world  You have to  It's not  It's not 1950 anymore  We can't just be  We can't just be this  Isolated island  We can't  You can't have the  Whole world  Pissed at you  All the time  You just can't  It gets tiring  Irritating  You know what though  What

[00:30:30]  Dude  Put the scream mask  On her  Who cares  Cleft chin  Jesus you're  Pakey open  Smash her face  In the pillow  Your pillow should look  Like the shroud of Turin  When you're done  With her  By the way  Scott from Hot Pog  Says it all  Brooke Hogan  Can bench more  Than Opie  So you know  I guarantee  She can bench  More than I  Of course  I would just be  Smothered by her  Yeah  That's a nice  Hip right there 
[00:31:00]  Dude she's sexy  Like that with the  The ass thing  Alright look  Could you find a picture  Where she's hanging out  With a normal sized girl  And then  You're gonna see  What we're talking about  Jimmy  I like  I saw one  She's a monster  I should've got a picture  With her and just touched  That big  Those big hips  And that big waist  A big ample bosom  On my head  Here you go  Little sunny boy Jim  That's what you'd look like  I would act out  On my infantilism fantasy  With her  Just cradle my head  Let me feed  Feed me  She could pick you up 
[00:31:30]  And cradle you  She would  I would sit on the couch  With her right  And she would  Let's just say  She would have oil  In one hand  And I'd be laying  Across her lap  And she'd be  Cradling my head  And she'd just  Remove her bikini top  Oh  And hold my head  Like oh let me just  Pull one down  Just one down  Yeah  And then her other hand  Would be busy  Right  I'd make this noise  Jimmy's noises  You're into giantism  Or something  Not necessarily  She's like that  Statue of Liberty  Broad from 
[00:32:00]  What was it  Happy days  Help me out  I know I went  Really obscure here  But  I'm kind of  Remembering that  That big tall girl  That was going out  With Richie  Was it Richie  And she easily  Was like  Four to six inches  Taller than him  And they were  At a dance  Or something  And she dressed  Like the Statue of Liberty  And she had flats on  Yes  And she's dancing  Was she on soap also  I don't know  I think she was like  She was on soap  She's probably the first one  To ever go  Oh my god  You're going bald Ron  All right 
[00:32:30]  Why don't we  Talk about UFOs  For a second  You heard about this  Right  What  The Apollo astronaut  I'm loving this stuff  This is  When astronauts  Kind of get into  When astronauts  Kind of get into  The mix here  And talk about this stuff  You gotta give it  A little more credence  I think  It's not just an astronaut  This guy walked on the moon  He did the longest  Moonwalk ever 
[00:33:00]  Yeah  This guy was on the moon  Maybe that drove him  Crazy dude  I tell you to dismiss him  I have too much time  At the moon rocks  This one  Well yeah  Just because he walked  On the moon  Maybe he's completely  Insane now  Maybe we should try  To find some info  I think his name  Is Edgar Mitchell  Right  Doctor  Doctor  Edgar Mitchell  From Apollo 14  He's saying  Absolutely there are UFOs  And the government  Is absolutely covering it up  Wow  Yeah we got some audio here  Listen to this  Do you believe in life 
[00:33:30]  On other planets  Oh yes  There's not much question  At all  But there's life  Throughout the universe  We're not alone  In the universe  At all  You're convinced  That we're not alone  In the universe  Oh I'm  No for sure  We're not alone  Hey Bob  Now have we been able  To identify for sure  Where the other planets are  No we have not  Certainly not  In our solar system  But they've identified  Quite a number of planets  Now that very likely  Could be life bearing planets  And I happen to be privileged 
[00:34:00]  Enough to have  Be in on the fact  That we have been  Businesses on this planet  And the UFO phenomenon  Is real  Although it's been  Covered up by our governments  For quite a long time  Whoa  Whoa  All right Hamilton  Dude  Eating some pizza  Learning about Cuba  He is by far  The most reputable  And believable source  To ever come out  About UFOs 
[00:34:30]  And the dumb response  After it  This is the guy  That probably knew  A lot of the inside workings  At NASA  Sure  And the research  That went into  Building  The spacecraft  And where  Some of that  Engineering  May have come from  I'm speculating here  But you know  This is a guy  That is on the inside  He flew in space  He flew in space  He was up there  He knows  How  He knows how it all works  He understands  Coming into the atmosphere  He knows what the moon 
[00:35:00]  Looks like  What the earth looks like  The guy was on the moon  Yeah  Wow is that a big one  That's a neutron bomb  The radio host  Got a nice exclusive  Anyway  Listen  Listen  Remember Gordon Cooper  That's my skull  I'm so wasted  One of the mercury  Astronauts  Gordon Cooper  Wrote a book  Called Leap of Faith  Which also talks  About the fact  He took a camera up  And photographed  Area 51  And when he landed  The Pentagon  Took the camera  Away from him  And he claims  That he flew  Or saw a craft 
[00:35:30]  That was made  From alien metals  And Gordon's  Not around anymore  But the book is good  Called Leap of Faith  Of course  Don't we have an astronaut  Coming in next week  Buzz Aldrin  Astronaut  What's wrong with you  How about  The second man  To walk on the moon  Yeah pretty much  The astronaut  Every photo  Of that moon landing  Is a Buzz Aldrin  Every one of those  Photos we've seen  Is a Buzz  Neil was shy  Only  Well Neil goes  No cameras boys  I'm working  There was only  One of those photos  Of Armstrong  It was this really weird 
[00:36:00]  One in the distance  Where he's working  On the lunar  On the LEM  Yeah  That was the only  Photo of  You know what  I didn't know that  Until right now  All Buzz Aldrin  Every photo  Did not know that  That's good to know  For next week's interview  Oh  Buzz would just jump  In the picture  Hey  Yeah  Hey a couple things  Put that picture back up  So we got Fergie  Standing next to  Brooke Hogan  And a lot of people  Think Fergie  Wow  Dude look at that  Fergie looks like a midget  Next to Brooke Hogan  How wonderful  They're just big heels 
[00:36:30]  She'd be wearing thigh highs  Like no pantyhose  Just thigh highs  And like a big thong  Dude that is  And she'd make you  Kiss her stomach  That's a huge girl man  Slap your face  During the act  You would just be  Bosom height  Yeah  You wouldn't even be able  To like kiss her  Or anything  Who cares  That big chin  Rested on the  Bedboard over there  I'm busy  You make this noise  Well  Jim wants to be smothered  Let's go to Luke in Buffalo  Luke  Hey guys  Hey Luke 
[00:37:00]  Hey  If Jimmy and Brooke  Slow dance  I'm an asshole  Sorry Luke  We're just laughing  And Ed just did like  A non-committed Luke  And it was just  I do it every time  It's still funny though  Oh I know  Someone just can't help it  Someone out there  Is getting it  That makes me laugh  And every time someone  Either Bill  Or Mike  Yeah  I'm almost disappointed  When I don't hear  Hello Bill  Mike  Mike  Go ahead  Sorry  Okay Luke  Go ahead Luke  Hey  If Jimmy and Brooke 
[00:37:30]  Slow dance  It would look like  Diane and Tony Manero  And Saturday Night Fever  These rappers  Arms around her  I'd love to watch you dance  To me  I don't even know  If that's funny  I don't remember  I don't know  I'd remember  The  Piggish woman  I'd love to watch you dance  Tony  I'd love to watch you dance  Thank you Jimmy  Hey  Can I  Patch your forehead  Tony  Remember that  That pig  And then the nanny  What's her name there  Fran Dresser  Yeah Fran Dresser 
[00:38:00]  Was in that movie too  She was the one that came out  And was dancing with him  And asked  I guess to have sex  And he was like  You know  What makes me think  What makes  What makes you think  Just cause I dance with you  That I sleep with you  And she goes  You know  Men have sent me flowers  Afterwards  And he goes  Maybe they thought  She was dead  You want to hear more  From the UFO  Astronaut  Of course  Dr. Edgar Mitchell  Talking about UFOs 
[00:38:30]  So  Whoa  This is  All of this  Is quite a shock to me  Well I'm sorry  You haven't been  Reading the papers recently  It's starting to open up  Quite a bit  So you're telling me  Well there's a lot  Of information  To take on board  Hang on a minute  I mean listen  I've heard  Like you know  Crazy UFO nuts  Tell me this kind of thing  Before  I've never had  Dr. Ed Mitchell  You know  The sixth man  To walk on the moon  A respected scientist  In his own right  Announced to me 
[00:39:00]  That we've been  Visited  By aliens  From other planets  And that they  Definitely are out there  There's no debating it  Well that's the first time  You've ever talked to me  Or I've told you  About it before  I like this guy  Hey  I'd have told you  You didn't ask  Yeah  NASA couldn't even  Dismiss him  NASA said  Their comment about him  Was like  We have the utmost  Respect for him  We happen to disagree  With him on this issue  That's all  What are they going to do  Badmouth him  They're sending some  Lieutenants over  And some captains 
[00:39:30]  And majors  To say hi to him  Sure  You can't kill  Your astronauts  You can't kill  Your astronauts  No  He's going to just  Get food poisoning  What happened to  Gordo Cooper  What happened to Gordo  How old was Gordo  When he died  I think in his 60s  See  They all smoked like crazy  Do you know the story  Of Gordo  I honestly don't know  I don't even know his name  I honestly have heard  This guy's name  Over the years  But you know  Aldrin, Michael Collins  And Armstrong  Those are the astronauts  The original Mercury 7  Who was the one 
[00:40:00]  That Jim  Lovell  Yeah  Let's say hi to Dave  On Long Island  Dave  Yeah my uncle  Was a big shot  Over in Grumman  When they were building  The LEM  And had the whole  Apollo program  Going on  They used to sit around  In a room  In Grumman  With reporters  During these moon shots  And these guys  On 14  When they were on  Their way to the moon  They says  We got something  Flying next to us  And then they ushered  All the reporters  Out of the room  He swears up and down 
[00:40:30]  This was true  Ushered all the reporters  Out of the room  And says  We got something  Flying next to us  Checking us out  And they're like  Are you sure about that  And he's like  Yeah  And then they hung around  For a little bit  And they took off  Yeah they all have  These  Not all  But a few of the  Crews have had sightings  But they usually  Write it off as  Debris from the ship  Itself  Some kind of  Venting  Or  You know  A lot of that stuff  Follows you  When stuff comes off 
[00:41:00]  Of a ship  It just follows you  Until something is there  To stop a moving object  In space  That thing's just  Going to keep going  I hate your logic  But  No I'm just saying  I like to think  That it's a UFO  With some weird creature  Just checking you out  And you really don't have  Much depth perception  Out the window  To tell if something  Is close or far away  So if something  Looks relatively large  And you think  It's far away  You'd think it's a ship  It could be a part  That's very close to you  That's very small  That's how 
[00:41:30]  I mean that's how  NASA has dismissed it  For many years  I don't know  I haven't been there  You and I may do that  And Opie may do that  Right right  A guy who's on his way  To the moon  Wouldn't do that  Because first of all  Anything that comes  Off the ship  They would know  It's amazing  The amount of knowledge  They have about  Every inch of the ship  And what's happening  With it  And for them to call in  And say something's  Checking us out  It's not  He would say  I think we got  The first logical leap  An astronaut would make  Is something  I think we got  A little debris  Yeah  Most astronauts 
[00:42:00]  Probably wouldn't call  NASA on an open frequency  And go  Yeah there's spacemen  Looking at us  Oh wait sorry  No no that's just a tire  That fell off  A tire  Jimmy makes a good point  Let's say I had a  Mongo the trucker  He's a regular to the show  What's up Mongo  Morning guys  Hey  I know why Jimmy  Loves Brooke Hogan  So much  She looks like a trainee  But the next day  He won't have a sore jaw  Wow 
[00:42:30]  Way to hurt someone's feelings  Slash be accurate  All right we got one more clip  From Edgar Mitchell  Dr. Edgar  Dr. Mitchell  So you believe in all  You believe the whole  The whole deal  There's more nonsense  Out there about this  Than there is  Real knowledge  But there is  It is a real phenomenon  And there's  Quite a few of us  There's  It's been well covered up  By all of our governments  For the last 60 years or so  But slowly it leaks out 
[00:43:00]  And some of us are privileged  To have been briefed  On some of it  I happen to have grown up  And I don't even know  Whether you know this place  Roswell, New Mexico  Where presumably  The Roswell incident  Of 1947 took place  And been quite knowledgeable  Of the lore there  And since I grew up there  But I've also been  In military circles  And intelligence circles  That knows beneath  The surface of what  Has been  Public knowledge  That yes 
[00:43:30]  We have been distant  Oh he's so dead  Oh is he so dead  He figured out  What the hell  I'm getting up there  That's exactly what it is  Test tube's gonna explode on him  I can finally start talking  Cause how many more years  Do I have  Yeah  Yeah  These guys are scared to talk  They're all starting to spill the beans  All these older guys  Right  Good  Didn't the guy  Who was the guy in Roswell  The original  I want to say he was a captain  What's his name  Kangaroo  No  I don't get it 
[00:44:00]  Captain Kangaroo  Come on  Jesus  I was thinking captain  I swear to god  I thought lieutenant kangaroo  Lieutenant kangaroo isn't funny  I should have a colostomy bag  Shlapped against my mouth  Yes  He saw a bunch of aliens come out  And they were all wearing green jeans  Green jeans  Yes  So what  The guy who was 
[00:44:30]  Involved with Roswell  Who originally  The air force put out there  And he showed the materials  Right  He had to come out and say  It was a weather balloon  Yeah  I do not know that guy's name  But didn't he on his deathbed  Say that it was real  Like he had to recant his story  And say it wasn't real  And on his deathbed  He came out and said it was  Yeah  But then other people recently  Have said it was a weather balloon  I don't know  The only thing I don't like about that  Is the testing  The little bodies  That so many people  Reported seeing  Yeah  They said were mannequins  That they were testing 
[00:45:00]  Like that guy  Who jumped from 102,000 feet  But it turns out  That those tests  Weren't happening  Until years after the Roswell  Like it happened in 47  And those tests  Didn't begin until  Like the early 50s  Yeah  So they were saying  They were those dummies  But  They weren't around then  Have you ever seen  Somewhere online  They zoom in  On a piece of paper  That somebody's holding  Oh yeah  To try to see  What was written on there  On a piece of paper  That was pretty cool  And they speculate  What the rest of it is  Under the guy's hand  And everything  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah that was recently  The guy giving the Navy explanation 
[00:45:30]  Or something years ago  Or the Air Force  Uh huh  All right  We got to  That'll never be  Completely explained  Or you know  Demystified  It's just one of those  Things now  That have become  Such American lore  That people don't want  To not believe it  But I don't think  You'll ever get  A definite proof  That'll make everybody  Believe it  I read  I read a story  A book  By a guy  It was a lieutenant colonel  I think  And he's been dismissed  As a nutty guy  But the book was great  He claims to have seen  The bodies  I think he said 
[00:46:00]  I want to say  They were taken to  Somewhere in Georgia  Or  And he said  That all the stuff  About UFOs  Is stored under  Foreign technologies  It's not stored  Under space aliens  And he said  Because the press knows  That they can't get  Into those files  They don't even try  To get into them  Because you're not  Going to get anywhere  So he said  That's where they keep them  Is under foreign technologies  Because they know  That the press  Why wouldn't they  They can't release  That information  Well we've got to ask  Buzz Aldrin about this  Next week  He'll probably dismiss it  And he was always an ass  All right Buzz  Thank you Buzz  And then he's going to 
[00:46:30]  Kick one of us  In the groin  And leave  I love Buzz  He's a bit tense  He clocked the news guy  In the face  When he said  That the moon landings  Were faked  Right  So Buzz  They were faked  Why don't you come out  And just say  That the moon landings  Were faked  Buzz Hulton turned around  And punched him in the face  The guy was one of those  He wasn't even a news guy  He was a conspiracy nut  Who was in his face  And I've seen the clip briefly  And Buzz just wasn't  Buzz is a man  Yeah  He walked on the moon  And he was on the moon  Beat it  Ask me fine  But don't get in my face  Imagine that 
[00:47:00]  You go to the moon  You come back  It's not an easy thing  And it's not a sure thing either  Especially when you're  On the first crew to do it  And then you got some idiot  In your face  Saying you didn't do it  Of course you punch him  It's a real man  I know  That's what I want  My astronauts to be  Men  Punch first  Ask later  We gotta take a break  We got David Duchovny  Coming in  In about an hour  Greg Gerardo  Who's playing our comedy show  At the PNC Bank Art Center  One of the many comedians

[00:48:30]  For details  We're kind of looking at  McCain and Obama  They had a split screen  On TV  It's  It's not even close  No  You can tell  One's a black man  One's a white man  Why?  Oh  Not even close  As far as  Oh  I thought you meant  In looks  Well  Sorry  And the McCain supporters  They're beating  Jimmy and I up  Every day  On instant feedback  I don't care  Either way  To be honest with you  I really don't  How are they going to  Beat us up  I've said I like McCain  What's the problem 
[00:49:00]  Because I don't want  To vote for him  That's the problem  They're going to  Beat me up  I would love  One of these dummies  To call  I don't care  If you agree with me  I don't say McCain  Sucks or he's a retard  I just don't want  Somebody that old  Sorry  I'm just stating  The obvious  Obama's going to  Be our next president  Yeah that does seem  To be the way  It's going to go  It's going to be  Interesting to watch  How he ages  During the presidency  Which is just  Traditionally aged  Gentlemen  At a quicker rate  He'll be driving 
[00:49:30]  Jessica Tandy  Every eight years  That's exactly  What I was thinking  He's going to  Finish out  Going well  It's been wonderful  To be your president  Here  And on  Nice  That's great  By the way  Can I point out  What a bunch  Of dummies  We are  As a country  Yeah please  I mean we really  Stink  An astronaut  Has just come out  And said that  Aliens have visited us  It has been covered up

[00:50:30]  And an astronaut  Is telling us  Yes  They do exist  And we don't get it  On our paper  You know what  Maybe it was  Because it's a six hour  Difference in London  So I saw this on Drudge  Late last night  No it broke before midnight  Because it was in  Travis' report  To all of us  The whole story  Was in the overnight  Prep stuff  So this broke  Before midnight  Yeah this is one  Of those things though  That makes people  Have to think  It's not a quick  Sound bite thing  You got to kind of 
[00:51:00]  Listen to what  He's talking about  And we don't like  Things like that  We get more important news  Christian Bale  Beat up his sister and mom  Because the sister  Came to him and said  Hey I need $200,000  That's what we get today  Oh was that the whole  Gist of that argument  Yeah more or less  Sister came to  Christian Bale  A couple hundred  Jeez  Has two kids  From one relationship  She's got a newborn  From a new relationship  She needed some money  And she went to her brother  And the brother  Didn't feel like 
[00:51:30]  Giving her the money  For whatever reason  And then the mom  Insulted Christian Bale's wife  And then all hell  Broke loose  And then Batman  Gets arrested  Yeah  That's what we get today  Instead of the possibility  Possibilities of aliens  Existing  You can only  Please aliens  If you're listening  Aliens  Hello  If you're listening  Don't come here peacefully  Because you won't get  Any coverage  You really won't get  Any coverage  If you  I'm convinced  If one just lands 
[00:52:00]  And they get out  They scoop some stuff up  They get  And it's completely  Documented  And it's like  Wow look  Aliens  They landed  And took off  It'd be  You know  Yanks gunning for socks  And then on page 32  You'd see  Hey by the way  A UFO landed  Some aliens got out  Took some dirt  And left  We need  Lasers  Laser fire  Lasers from above  That's what we need  You know our instinct  Would be to just  Kill the little effer  That's true too 
[00:52:30]  I'd take a pot shot  At one if it was  In my yard  What are you doing  Get out of my yard  In our luck  They would be  Coming down  To tell us  How the whole  Universe works  But our first instinct  Is to kill him  Just kill him  Kill him  Show him how strong  We are  We don't need to  Hear what the little  Fella has to say  Just kill him  What does he know  Let's see if he's tasty  We were talking about  John McCain earlier  And how Obama's  Just looking like  A rock star  And McCain's  Kind of looking  Frumpy  Feeble  And I think 
[00:53:00]  You brought it up  That he was on  Conan O'Brien  Conan  And he just wasn't  You know when a  Candidate goes on a show  Like Conan  Or the Daily Show  Or any of these  Kind of comedy  Talk shows  You really got to  Step it up  You got to be good  There are some  Politicians that have  Been very good at  Doing that  One that I don't  Really like  But is very funny  On the Daily Show  Is that ass  From Connecticut  What's his name  Lieberman  Oh Lieberman  Yeah  I can't stand Lieberman 
[00:53:30]  But he's pretty funny  On the Daily Show  He's a frequent guest  He knows what the  Show's about  And he's got  A couple of good  Jokes  He gets a couple  Of good jokes  In and stuff like that  So you got to  Kind of have some  Comedy chops  To do that  If you don't  Don't go on  The goddamn show  Sure  So he goes on  Conan  I guess to try  To appeal to  The younger set  And he just  Failed miserably  And this is a  New phenomenon  Yeah  Who started this  Clinton I guess  I think Nixon  Going on laughing 
[00:54:00]  Suck it to me  Yeah but  Nixon was on  The Tonight Show  Yeah  Was he on  The Tonight Show  Jack Parr  Sure  So why do people  I want to talk to you  About the Jew  Jack  Let me talk to you  About two Jews  Walking to a bar  One of them  Is Henry Kissinger  The other is  My speech writer  Ben Stein  A lot of people  Think Clinton  Started that whole thing 
[00:54:30]  But I guess it has  Been going on  Over the years  I think it was  You know  When Clinton did it  Obviously  Television  And stuff  It was open  To a lot more people  Yeah  So  But he  Wasn't the first person  To do it  But now  It is a thing  Where you want  To be seen  As having a personality  This is where you go  When you give those speeches  At a debate  Or what not  You're not really  Giving your personality  You're giving your points  Of view  Your platform  This is where you 
[00:55:00]  Open up  And people go  Wow  That guy's funny  Or that's a sense  Of humor  That's the kind  Of person  I'd like to have  In office  Because he's a real  Human being  Kind of a thing  And I'm sorry  You know  I'm a Republican  But McCain  Just failed miserably  Well here's McCain  On Conan O'Brien  Trying to be funny  Can I start out  This is  This is  McCain Pirate  McCain Pirate  What is McCain Pirate  All about there  Well he came out  And he handed  Conan a hat  An orange hat  With black 
[00:55:30]  Writing on the front  And it said  McCain Pirate  No it didn't  Yes it did  He had a hat  Made for his  Conan O'Brien  And I didn't  Know what it meant  So I'm waiting  For the explanation  And when you hear  The explanation  It makes no sense  What so ever  You get the chills  Of the D variety  That was the  Right when  And this was  Right off the bat  Right when he  Walked out  That's when I went  Uh oh  Uh oh  When I start out 
[00:56:00]  This is  This is  McCain Pirate  McCain Pirate  And that's because  Being on your show  Is like walking  The plank  No no no  Now if it's  A McCain Pirate  Boo  See why  Is it like  Being on your show  Is like walking  The plank  Because if  McCain's the pirate  Then Conan  Would be walking  The plank  Because it's  McCain Pirate  Not Conan Pirate  Why do you just  Name it  McCain Pirate  Yeah  It doesn't make 
[00:56:30]  Any sense  Here's a cap  This is  Jim baseball player  What a retard  Now I am calling  Him a retard  It's  It's really  It made no sense  It was a very  Uncomfortable moment  Conan had to put  The hat on his head  The audience was  Given this sympathetic  Kind of  Laugh  And then Conan  Put the hat on  And tried to make  A joke  To get out of  The joke  And I'm just  Sitting there  Again going  Uh oh  Like  The worst thing  You want to have  To do is now  Recover  From your first 
[00:57:00]  Bomb  I would have  Taken that hat  And thrown it  In the garbage  Right in front  Of him  Beat it  He should have  Put it on his head  And then looked  At McCain  And said  Now what  Yeah  Yeah exactly  Bring the funny  Exactly  Do one jumping jack  And I'll vote for you  In this next clip  McCain makes a  Confusing joke  About that  About the hat  Being orange  Oh wait  Yeah  Because the hat's orange  Wait it's a cap  Oh yeah  It's not a  I thought it was a  Baseball  I mean a pirate hat  Oh no  No  Now that might have 
[00:57:30]  Been funny  I don't know  He put him a  Baseball hat  That you said  McCain pirate  On it  Yeah  Yeah  That's awful  An orange  Bright orange hat  With black writing  That said  McCain pirate  Hope you'll be  A McCain pirate  Yes  It matches my  Flesh tone  Perfectly  Thank you  A thickly orange  And your bathing suit  Yeah  We'll talk about that  And your  And your bathing suit  We can't brush over  On your bathing suit  No  Because it matches  My complexion 
[00:58:00]  Which was a funny gag  Because it's a bright  Orange hat  And Conan  Of course  Is bright orange  And then he goes  Yeah it matches  My complexion  You're having  Your bathing suit  What  What does that mean  I don't know  So I sat back  And went  Uh oh  I love that  You've given up  Oh it's  I remember  A mere few months ago  You're like  There's no way  We're gonna have  A black president  I know  I said it  You have given up  Now all I buy 
[00:58:30]  Are gold bars  And guns  All right  Conan is tired  Of making age jokes  McCain gives him  An alternative  We are tired  Of this take on you  We don't want to do  Those jokes anymore  Can you give us  Anything else  Do you have a  Do you have a  Kooky uncle  Do you have  Bad breath  Webbed toes  Anything  Give us something  And we will run with it  All of the above  All of the above  All right  I was able to  Get shot down 
[00:59:00]  Right  Right  I would intercept  A surface air missile  With my own airplane  That's no mean feat  I think that's  People don't really  Laugh at that  I tried that  They're like  Yeah yeah  He said  We're here  What's your problem  People don't really  Laugh at that  He doesn't even  Understand what humor is  No he didn't have  Any kind of humorous  Anecdote to tell  Conan O'Brien's  Working it big time  He's trying  He's trying  I mean  He's got McCain  Right there in front of him  He's trying 
[00:59:30]  His damnedest  And McCain's  Giving him nothing  He just had nothing  At one point  The most uncomfortable  Moment  Of the  Of the evening  Was when McCain  Was  They were talking  About his age  And  As Conan  Was talking  McCain slowly  Tipped himself over  Shut his eyes  And  Like as if  Almost collapsing  On Conan's desk  Yeah  It didn't get  A peep  People were scared 
[01:00:00]  They  I absolutely  Thought  He was  Fainting  Or dying  In that chair  He was trying  To make a joke  Like look  I'm old  I know  I need my nap  And people  Thought he was  Look  Like  Conan grabbed  At him  He grabbed  At his shoulder  Like are you okay  Right  I bet you  Most people  Thought it was  Just a tumor  That got too big  And weighed him  Down  To the left  He's gonna have  Another bandaid  On that side  Of his head  Right  This poor guy 
[01:00:30]  He is a war hero  Alright we go to  McCain tells a  Not funny story  About his mom  Yeah  No no no  We need to find  Something else  And so  Just think about it  Get back  How about my mom  You know about my mom  She's 96  Yeah  96  She likes  She likes  Gellin of color  So now I think  Yeah  After he did that  Other thing  I'm sitting there  And I watch  And all I could do  Was go  Uh oh 
[01:01:00]  When he was  Falling asleep  Uh oh  Uh oh  This isn't good  Not even a reaction  When he was making  Believe he was  Falling asleep  No  It was a reaction  But it was a reaction  Of pure fear  Right  That the EMTs  I'm really surprised  You didn't just see  Emergency service workers  Just come flying out  From the wings  Yeah  And try to help him  They were scared  Yeah and then  Conan's like  Okay give us something  So I'm thinking  He's going into  A humorous anecdote  About his mom  And he tells 
[01:01:30]  This story  That  Just goes  No it's like  An E-Rock story  No no no  We need to find  Something else  And so  Think about it  Get back to us  About my mom  You know about my mom  She's 96  Yeah  96  96 year old mom  Yeah  A couple of  Christmases ago  She flies to Paris  Because she wants  To drive around France  She goes to rent a car  They said she was too old  So she bought one  And drove around France  She bought a car  So she could drive around  That story stunk 
[01:02:00]  I want to hear a story  I hope his mother  Is killed  But like by some kind  Of a weird animal  Trampling  How is that going to happen  I don't  Like some weird  Emus  Like you live all those years  Yeah some bizarre animal  Like a bunch of emus  Where she goes to pet  A circus elephant  And it just breaks free  And steps on her face  And all of a sudden  She's dead  Oh god  Like for no reason  All those years of living  And a tragic  Huge  Dumb animal  Tramples her  To wipe his mother's hat  Out from under the elephant's foot 
[01:02:30]  It would be funnier  Than that damn story  He told  She's in France  She wanted to rent a car  She was too old  So she bought one  Ta-da  The aristocrats  Uh-oh  There's your guy  I see England  I see France  I see my mom's underpants  Uh-oh  Anyone else suspicious  About the audience  Uh-oh  What do you mean  They're a bit too excited  About everything he's saying  Yeah they're giving  These sympathetic  Uncomfortable laughs 
[01:03:00]  I hear  Excitement  Like maybe  Maybe  Loaded audience  They loaded a  Audience full of  McCain supporters  Believe me  Because they're way too  They're way too excited  You don't think they can do that  Hey Conan  You want him  I'm not here  Here's the audience  You're gonna have  I'm not hearing  The sympathy reaction  I'm hearing more of a  Over the top  Oh you're great  Reaction  Yeah  Plus the fact is  It's a presidential candidate  You don't get that close  To one of them  You're a regular audience member  You normally don't get  Within 20 feet of a  Yeah that's true  Would you be excited 
[01:03:30]  If he walked in here  Of course  McCain  Sure  Yeah that would be  More excited about  David Duchovny  Would be  I would be more excited  To meet David Duchovny  I swear to god  I would not  Than John McCain  If Obama walked in  I would probably faint  Oh yeah  Fruit  I'd be stark  But I wouldn't faint  I think I would faint  Because of anxiety  Like homina homina  Homina type of thing  Kenny would have him removed  Yeah  You can't be here  You need a building ID  That stupid haircut 
[01:04:00]  Kenny got  Is no one gonna acknowledge that  Oh god  Where is that retard hair  Who cut his haircut  Dr. Frankenstein  That's awful  He has a big flat hairdo  Yeah  Terrible  It's terrible  Yeah we'll make fun of him  After the break  One more McCain story  Another story about Mama  Conan O'Brien  Great  I'll try to make it quick  But I wrote a book once  Where I had talked about  When I was being taken  From interrogation 
[01:04:30]  One part of the book  To  From my sale to interrogation  I used to yell obscenities  At the guards  To help the morale  Of my friends  And  To make a long story short  Some of those were in  A magazine  That excerpted the book  I got a call from my mom  She said  Johnny  I said yes  She said  I just read  The excerpts  In that magazine  From your book  And I said  Well  What did you think  And she said  I'm coming over there  And wash your mouth out  With soap  I never taught you  To use language like that 
[01:05:00]  Under any circumstance  I said  These guys are bad guys  That's no excuse  The story was awful  Wash your mouth out  With soap  How old are you  That's an  Yeah  That's something  That just  Hasn't been done  In  Decades  My mom  Heard the language  I used  To my  Vietnamese captors  And said  I'm gonna wash your mouth  Out with soap  He'd probably been good  Said good  Yeah  Please I haven't been able  To brush my teeth  In years  Soap would be fine 
[01:05:30]  Whatever  Can't stand the smell  Of myself  I'm gonna wash your mouth  Out with soap  And take all that starch  Out of your shirt sleeves  I'm rotting here  Yeah so again  I just sat and went  Uh oh  Yeah  Uh oh  Trouble  For the Republican Party  Not quite a party  When he's throwing it  It's a snooze fest  It really was  So that was him  On Conan  Which got me like  I don't  And you see Obama 
[01:06:00]  Going on some of these shows  And  He's not much better  He's a little more rehearsed  Well when he did that stuff  For the WWE  It was like  Ugh  There's no Bill Clinton  With the saxophone  I'll tell you that much  No  But I mean  You know  He sounds a lot like The Rock  And he didn't even  Really understand  That he sounded  A lot like The Rock  Maybe I'm getting too inside now  But he fell flat with that  Alright someone has to say it  We're judging presidential candidates  On the way they deliver punchlines  And do wrestling impressions  Yes  We are dummies  But this is America  This is what  This is what it's all about 
[01:06:30]  Just the things we're pointing out  You're like  With the pirate hat  That wasn't funny  We wouldn't vote for him  And Barack  Oh he does a terrible rock impression  Boo  This is how we make our decisions  In America though  We could go on the street again  We've done this a few times already  What's the haps  We could do what's the haps  Why are you voting for McCain  Why are you voting for Obama  And it's amazing why people  Will vote for a certain candidate  Not because of what they believe in  As far as policy goes  Yeah  It's like well he's cute  He's this  He's that  He's got personality 
[01:07:00]  Yeah exactly  Personality goes a long way  Alright we gotta take a break  Greg Giraldo joining the show next  And in about a half hour  David Duchovny  Stopping by to say hi  Cool  But first we've got  Primetime gossip  With our own Sam Roberts  Just in case you missed this one  From yesterday  We're back with another  Primetime gossip update  From Primetime Sam Roberts  When we last left you  We talked about the plight  Of Antellini's Anthony Cumia  And his quote unquote  Mystery illness  I was like frying in bed  Yeah 
[01:07:30]  Just laying in a puddle of sweat  At one point  I thought I had  Accidentally wet the bed  Well  There may have been  Some funny business  Happening behind closed doors  At the Opie and Anthony show  Because gay executive producer  Steve C  Has started showing  Similar symptoms  Steve C  Texted me  He  Apparently  Was in bad shape  We all know how this disease  Has passed  Don't we  Steve also announced  That he was getting  A colonoscopy done  Not because a doctor

[01:09:00]  I only went in  For appearances on stage  Yeah  When I wasn't on the stage  I was out at one of the  Parties in the parking lot  I took a golf cart  Yeah  And people were like  You're on in like three minutes  Whoa  I hop in the golf cart  Back to the stage  You stressed out Kenny  Last year too  Because at one point  Anthony decided that  All the fans needed to be  Backstage  Oh come on  I got a little friendly  Going come on  I'll take you back  And Kenny just  Come on  Threw his arms up in the air 
[01:09:30]  And gave up  I've never seen Kenny  Give up before in my life  They were only girls  I wasn't bringing  Smelly guys back  Pretty smelling girls  And is there anything  Wrong with that  Homo  Anything  Anyone  Yeah I don't see anyone  Anyone speaking up now  Is that the show  Where he was in the parking lot  Just projectile vomiting  Like it was a Monty Python film  No that was the day  Of um  That was the  Mohegan Sun  Yeah yeah  Mohegan Sun 
[01:10:00]  Because I was up all night  Gambling and drinking  Where half the comedians  Actually went into the green room  And kept asking  If you were okay  Yeah  And the answer was no  Is he okay  We usually go out in the golf cart  And tour the parking lot  And say hi to the fans  And everything like that  So we're taking pictures  And I  During one photo op  I was like  Uh oh  This ain't good  So I ran off  To one of the portable toilets  Where I  Just about turned myself  Inside out  I really

[01:16:30]  That's not going to scare the teller  Sure would  Unless you put it in their eyes  Burns  He pulled out a gun  That's what everyone would want to do  Hearing that  Of course  I wish I had a pistol  Let's see what else happened here  And nothing  Did he shoot  Somehow that made the news  These kids just called in  We're going to find out  We got more audio to go here  He pulled out a gun  Pardon me  Would you have any gray Poupon?  Most of us are familiar with that question 
[01:17:00]  Thanks to a number of gray Poupon commercials  That aired on televisions across the country  In the late 80s and early 90s  But that wasn't the response  A car full of teenagers got  When they asked that same question  The driver of the car next to them  At a Murray stoplight  22 year old Vitaly Kovtun  Instead pulled out a gun  Is that a Russian name? 
[01:17:30]  It sounds Russian  Okay  What is it?  Yeah it sounds Russian  It sounds Russian?  Sure  Okay  He has no idea what gray Poupon is  No it's just  In Russia it's a huge insult  To ask anyone for  It was for mustard  For mustard  You don't do that to people  He probably thought it was  Gray Poupon  Which means something awful  What is this you ask of me?  For the gray Poupon  What the  Get out of here  Stupid children  Children 
[01:18:00]  He racked the slide back  And then  Basically told  Told the other kids  That you know  Here's your gray Poupon  Now  Here's your gray Poupon  Oh this guy's a laugh  How could he be that dangerous  And that corny?  Here's your gray Poupon  I got your gray Poupon  Got your gray Poupon right here  The delivery on that line  Come on  Oh lord  That's very funny  Have some fun with the delivery 
[01:18:30]  It's that  You know  Here's your gray Poupon  Now  Roll up your window  The teams  Jotted down the driver's  License plate number  Murray police  Murray police  Arrested  You know what  Take your beating  And go away  And the fact that  They remembered exactly  Like they had to go  Running to the cops  And then  We just asked him  If you had any gray Poupon  And he pulled out a gun  And then he said  Here's your gray Poupon  It was a gun  Murray police  Arrested  Kovtun  Who they say 
[01:19:00]  Admitted he pulled out the gun  They were just  Just goofing around  Teenagers do  Just kind of playing a little joke  Didn't think it would be  That big a deal  And obviously scared to death  When it happened  Kovtun  Who holds a concealed  Weapons permit  Has been charged  With aggravated assault  For this  Which is a third degree  Felony  It's a horrible idea  You know  The idea I believe  Behind the concealed  Weapons permit  Is strictly for your own  Safety for your own defense  And jokes  To defend yourself  Against the threat of death  And I spoke to the department  That issues concealed 
[01:19:30]  Weapons permits today  A representative told me  Over the phone  Kovtun's permit  Will be suspended  Until there is a resolution  In the case  How did he get one  At 22?  What permit?  Is he 22 years old?  You're allowed  Has he got a permit  I guess a permit to carry?  Yeah  Yeah  I just not in Manhattan  Right  Okay  I love that they tracked down  The expert  Who said  That's not for this  When we issue a gun permit  Yeah yeah  When we issue  It's not intended for  Grandishing  We frown against 
[01:20:00]  Grandishing of weapons  I mean yes  One will feel the urge  To do this  But typically speaking  The intention is  For self-defense  I don't think  There's one person  That has a concealed  Weapons permit  That hasn't thought  It would be funny  To do this  But you know  Common sense  Grassholding goes  No you don't do that  It's for protection  And they will take  Your license away  For brandishing it  For a Grey Poupon joke 
[01:20:30]  They're still doing it  I love that  Maybe his mom died  From mustard  From mustard gas  Back in the Soviet Union  That is not funny  Not funny  You make love  My mother  She make dead  Greg Giraldo  Right on man  Hey moving on  Really fast  Because we did  This story yesterday  Maybe we could get  An update  But the jilted bride  Is on the Today show 
[01:21:00]  This morning  Giraldo  God this annoys me  We had this yesterday  So you got a bride  She's getting married  Whatever  And the guy backs out  Because he finds out  This woman had a lot of debt  And I'm sure there were  Other issues  But he's saying  You know he didn't want  To enter into a marriage  With this woman  That had so much debt  So he bailed  She turned around  And sued the guy  And won  No  150 grand  Yeah  $150,000  $150,000  For what?  What was the date?  A breach of contract 
[01:21:30]  I don't know  Yes  Is that what it was?  Yeah  Officially  And she got to keep the ring  And all that  And they're saying  The ring was  A pretty impressive one  This is before  You're married now  And he also paid off  Some of her debt  Before all this went down  Now before you're married  You can get screwed over  Yeah  Hey how about that?  Yeah  So now you gotta  Get a  What?  A pre  Engagement  Nuptial agreement  What the  Oh my  I have no idea  You know the one little bit of law  That I remember 
[01:22:00]  And I don't know why I remember this  Is when it comes to engagement rings  If you give them  People always give them to people  On a birthday or Christmas  Or something like that  Don't do that  Because then if the engagement breaks off  They can keep it  Because it's a gift  It's a gift  But if it's a gift  In contemplation of marriage  If you just give it to them  On another day  And you break up  Then technically  You gotta get the ring back  Yeah  I'm just trying to inform people  Well if you're  If you're kind of  A little cheap  Yeah  Then you might want to  Combine the holiday  And that  And then  It leads me to believe  It's not gonna be  A very expensive ring 
[01:22:30]  Now I'm doing this  From personal experience  When I went to  The  Jewelry store  In Penn Station  On my way up to  Boston  Very nice  To get engaged  To my ex  You know what  Most people don't realize  You can get a nice  Engagement ring  At Penn Station  No  Not many people did  Right by the orange  Julius  Oh it was fantastic  And that was also  A Christmas present  So I covered all my bases  Yeah  It seems like a good 
[01:23:00]  You save yourself  You know  A hundred bucks  On a gift  But then if you want  The ring back  Well  Anthony  I didn't need it back  Anthony hasn't saved  Any money on this  No  On this  No  That ring ended up  Costing a lot more  I could have bought  The Hope Diamond  That's my own  Personal Blood Diamond  That I bought  In Penn Station  What do you need  An engagement ring kid  Come here 
[01:23:30]  Getting more info  About this lady  She left her job  And moved  The award was equal  To her salary  Plus bonuses  And benefits  For a year  They were never  Married my friend  There's no reason  She should have been  Married  Anything  Never married  There's no guarantees  People  Are  Assuming  That there's  Guarantees  In life  And in being  An American  That you're  Guaranteed  Certain things 
[01:24:00]  You're supposedly  Guaranteed  You know  What's in the  Constitution  Your Bill of Rights  Things like that  Those are  Guarantees  I guess  And even those  Aren't guaranteed  Anything else  It's a crapshoot  Oh what  You don't have  Enough money  You don't have  A good car  You don't have  This  It's not my  Problem  People  Just get me  Off this planet  Please aliens  I know you're  Out there  Sometimes I walk 
[01:24:30]  Around and I look  And I go  God damn  Human beings  Like I curse  My  I'm a self  Hating human  I'm a self  Hating human  Because I don't  Like human beings  Another alternative  Would be great  What drives you  Nuts about  Human beings  The stupidity  Hypocrisy  Ill informed  Asses  Walking around  Thinking they  Just know  Everything  When they don't  Even know  Enough  You don't know 
[01:25:00]  Enough to make  A decision  On anything  I hate the  Neediness of  Humans  That's another  Thing  I go back  To the movie  Theater  Because we  Saw Dark Knight  Recently at the  IMAX  So they  Squeeze what  Like 2,000  People in there  Whatever the  Hell that  Thing fits  And they're  All eating  At the same  Time  And I'm  Just thinking  Needy  Needy  More  More  Feed  Myself  Feed  Feed  Feed  It sounds  Like I say  It a lot  But it sounds  Like locusts  Just going  Through a  Field  Just munching  Away on the 
[01:25:30]  Popcorn  And it drives  It hits me  On a level  I can't even  Explain  The hatred  I have for  People at  That moment  Because they're  Ripping up  Their candy  I need candy  Soda  Popcorn  More  More  More  Need  Need  Need  There are  Probably better  Reasons to  Hate people  I understand  That  Epiphilia  And rape  And murder  But it all  Gets crazy  Like god damn  In the movie  Theater  They have to  Eat  Enjoy their  Experience  But I'm not  In the middle  Of a movie  Theater  With a bunch  Of pedophiles  So I don't  Know what  The hell  They're doing  Depends on the  Movie you're  Seeing  I saw  WALL-E 
[01:26:00]  But you know  The thing about  WALL-E  Did you see it  Do you know  How to say it  Because I'm still  Trying to figure  It out  Is it WALL-E  Or WALL-E  I say WALL-E  But you know  I say  WALL-E  Tomato  Tomato  Let's all  Agree to get  It's called  Hulping off  But they  In that movie  I have kids  I had to go  See it  And it's  The vision  Of the future  They're all  Floating around  In outer space  Just giant  Fat bloated  Monsters eating  And drinking  All the time  They're on  These floating  Chairs  They don't even  Walk in  That's where  We're at  That is pretty  Much where  We're at  Did the boys 
[01:26:30]  Like the movie  They did like  The movie  But not as much  As I disliked  Parts of the Dark Knight  That Maggie Gyllenhaal  Was in  Since when is she hot  She was so pretty  When is she hot  Is she just  Forced down her throat  Patrice said the same thing  I said the same thing  She has like  Old lady face  But she's still youthful  And you know  She's a really good actress  But she's not a good actress  Because you could see  In that role  She wasn't good  You could see her thinking  I know I'm not believable  I'm really torturing  Batman 
[01:27:00]  He's tortured over  You know  Unrequited love  From me  Two guys are fighting  Over her  That's not happening  Yeah the richest guy  In the city  Who fights crime  And he flies  The guy can fly  With his cape  Maggie Gyllenhaal  Is the chick  That's the catch  Yeah sure  We were talking about that  Who was mentioning that yesterday  With the fact that her  And the other one  From Superman  Oh Margot Kidder  Oh right  It's like Superman  Is giving it all up  And walking into  His fortress of solitude  And putting the green crystal in  And taking his powers away  So he can have sex 
[01:27:30]  With Margot Kidder  Yeah  I don't think so  Margot Kidder  Oh I would  I would have said  Yeah all my powers are gone  And then just blown  The top of her head off  That would have been great  No everything's fine  Don't worry  I'm feeling this sensation  Whammo  Her head's on the hotel room ceiling  Yeah  And going back to Maggie  She's playing Katie Holmes' character  Yeah  They should have just made  A brand new character  For this film movie 
[01:28:00]  And it's shot the way  It's supposed to be like  The stunning girls  You can't take your eyes off  Where they just have the camera  Lingering on her forever  And the whole time  You're going  She's  She's a piggy  She had a mopey face  She's a ass face  Mopey  I told her  She looked like Princess Leia  She was really like Carrie Fisher  Mopey  Unpleasant looking  Average blick  That was one of the problems  With Dark Knight  They didn't have beautiful women in it  There was no eye candy really  I don't mind that  If there's no reason for them  But if one's supposed to be hot  Right  She should be sizzling 
[01:28:30]  If her beauty is influencing  The main character  Yeah  Then she should be beautiful  Well the whole scene  There's tons  There's at least three or four scenes  Where they're standing there going  Like I'm just  I'm just so stunned  By your beauty  And you could see her face  She almost wanted to go  Come on  Alright  Who cast me  Yeah  I go  I know  She was almost twitching herself  She was almost like  She knew it was a ridiculous  Casting by Gyllenhaal casting  Yeah  Did you like Heath Ledger? 
[01:29:00]  He was great  Amazing right?  He really was great  Yeah it really was  A lot of us are saying  Now we miss him  You know  When he dies  Like ah  That too bad  Yeah  Some young actor  You know  He's easy  After that performance  You would like to  You know  Wonder what he would have done  After this  When he spits in his mitt  In Brokeback Mountain  That's the moment I said  I'm gonna miss this kid  I still haven't brought myself  To be able to see that movie  Brokeback Mountain  That's the most homophobic thing  I've ever done in my life  Is not be able to watch it  That tense scene is  Wow  Sexy 
[01:29:30]  I'm with Geraldo  You'd like have to prepare yourself  For something  I'm not prepared  Buckle in  I'm not prepared yet  Wrap in kids  Can't do it  And the more like  People talk about that movie  They're like  It really is a good movie  But I still just can't  It looks corny  Even if it was a guy  And a chick  It would be corny  It would be unbearable  So like  The two dudes  I mean  Although maybe it does  Add a wrinkle  That I should stay open to  Yeah  There's a possibility  Alright listen  We gotta take a break  Cause  I was just looking  At the trailer  Wow  For the Will Ferrell  John C. Reilly movie 
[01:30:00]  Man  The dead living bunk face  Is gonna be  I gotta see that  You are such an ass  Who doesn't  You are an ass  You know  We have to say  We have to  We're done with Will Ferrell  As far as this show goes  We're done with him  Until he wants to call in  We're done with him  Until he wants to call in  We promoted that garbage  Semi pro  With the understanding  That he was gonna do  Our radio show 
[01:30:30]  And we went and saw the movie  And talked around  How bad it was  I mean we really  Put ourselves out there  For that dumb movie  He blows us off  Cause he knew how bad  The movie was  And then he was supposed  To call yesterday  With John C. Reilly  For this stepbrothers movie  And out of nowhere  Like five minutes before  They're going on the air  Will Ferrell's  Quote sick  We're done with this guy  Yeah but  Done  In that movie though  One is gonna want one thing  The other's gonna want the other  It's the comedy is conflict  They both kind of dress 
[01:31:00]  Like little kids  You know  It's just like  Boys being boys  Yeah  They're in their 40's  And they're living together  Because see their parents  Ended up getting married  So now they're stepbrothers  But they're grown men though  But they probably behave  Like children  Like teenagers  Like kids  As grown men though  Oh man  Both vying for the attention  Of their parents right  Yeah you know  They kind of look like  They have the curly hair  It's just  Cause John C. Reilly's last one  With the dewy cocks thing  That was terrific 
[01:31:30]  It's funny  Funny guys  We've had it with people  Blowing us off for dumb reasons  I like Will Ferrell actually  But that just looks  Who doesn't  But enough  Stop making excuses  Are you gonna be part of our show  Or not  No it's a not  Uh man  He has spoken  Man on wire  100% positive reviews  On RottenTomatoes.com  100%  Three people from France  We had Philippe Petit  Uh huh  On that couch  Earlier this week  And uh  You know  He doesn't believe in God  But the gods believe in him  He's a tightrope 
[01:32:00]  You know what  He is  No I don't  Walk between the trade centers  On the tightrope  Oh that guy  Yeah yeah yeah  He doesn't believe in God  But the gods  You know  The gods do believe in him  They believe in him  So it's a terrific  If the gods believe in the rest of us  He would have fallen  What he's got  He's got a documentary out  Is that what it is  Yes very timely  1974 he did the walk  Well  The towers have been gone  For seven years  And Mr. Finger on the pulse  Yeah  Puts one out now  In 2008  This has been a discussion  For a long time  And I saw a man on wire 
[01:32:30]  It's a really good film  Uh we were very  Very disappointed  With Philippe Petit  When he came in  And we felt like  We should have really  Went after him  And we're  We're mad at ourselves  We did not  Yeah it doesn't seem like  Uh I can't imagine  Like the O&A guys  You guys uh  Going after a French  Uh high wire artist  What could you have gone  What could possibly  Have rubbed you the wrong way  What was some of the other stuff  He was very uh  He's just a dick  Like  I was very nice to him 
[01:33:00]  Cause I liked him  I mean I'm afraid of heights  And what he did was amazing  Yeah  But it's like  Everything I tried to compliment on  He was like  He was like one of those guys  When you go  Well like uh  Like uh  Carl Wallenda felt  Was definitely  Did that make you think  About that  Well I don't  I tried to think  About other people  Where I said  What would happen  If you would have  Dropped the stick  Well there is  I don't think of the if  Shut up  You do  Of course you do  I didn't say that  Though until later  I didn't realize  That everything I said  To this little fruit  He was bitching me on  I took it too  I took it  To this little fruit  He really was 
[01:33:30]  He gave it to me good  And I took it  We kind of blew it  On that one  But whatever  Whatever  What can I tell you  You're a little starstruck  I guess  You like the guy  Yeah but I didn't  Realize until afterwards  We were excited  I think we all  Love daredevils  That's a pretty  Unbelievably ballsy  Thing to do  You gotta give him that  It's amazingly ballsy  Especially when he laid  You ever see photos  Of him laying down  On the wire  Can we show Greg  Some pictures  And talk during  The break  Yeah we'll do that  Because we gotta  Take a break  Greg Giraldo  He's playing  The comedy show  We're doing next  Saturday  At the PNC Bank  Art Center  In Homedale  New Jersey  One of the reasons  We invited Greg

[01:36:30]  About this the last  Couple of days  The guy decided to bail  He didn't want to  Get married after all  Did Danny say  I hate this woman  Or I hate all women  Not that he's gay  He's angry  I'll kick the thing again  Kick it  Kick it  Someone get the hint  And they'll fix it  Well here she is  On the Today Show  Rosemary Schell  Is with us exclusively  Along with her attorney  Lydia Sartin  Good morning to both of you  Where's the attorney  Rosemary first of all  Your reaction to this  To this jury decision 
[01:37:00]  Of $150,000  Were you surprised  By the amount  A little bit  But I was thrilled  I feel like justice  Was really  They weren't married  What are we doing  Do you know what the word  Justice means  You dummy  I felt that justice  Was miscarried  Unless that's the next word  This guy doesn't owe her  Crap  I felt that Jesus  Would be very happy  I feel like justice  Was really done  You know  Engagements  As sad as it is 
[01:37:30]  Are broken all the time  Why did you feel  The need to take  Evil action  Primarily because  He made a promise  To me  Primarily because  I'm a good  A promise  He made a promise  To me  You know what  Promises aren't  Always kept  And it doesn't mean  That he owes you  $100,000  It means you could  Call him an ass  Worse  You could call him  Whatever the hell  You want  But where does that  Then give her  The right to get  Over $100,000  Of this guy's money 
[01:38:00]  Because he broke  This promise  To marry her  Oh god  I hurt this stuff  Primarily because  He made a promise  To me  And I relied  On that promise  And gave up  A lot of things  Because of that promise  Well  And I suffered  Significantly for it  Gave up in particular  A good paying job  Too bad  Maybe your judgment  Should be fixed  Right  Find other guys  That's called  Life  See people don't understand  It's called life  Life is this thing 
[01:38:30]  That you go through  Point A is being born  And then point B  Is croaking  And in between  Is something called  Your life  And there's no guarantee  That promises  Are kept  And decisions  That you make  Are going to be  Good ones all the time  And that other people  Are responsible  For those decisions  This bitch  It's not going to be  A smooth ride  No  It's going to have  Bumps in the road  Of course  She didn't deserve  The money though  I mean like  What 
[01:39:00]  Jimmy  It's the guy  Suck it  Come here  Come here  I'll do that anyway  Come here  I'll do that simply  For the gig  No but if  The guy promised  To do a certain thing  And she gave up a job  It's like  Doesn't matter  That's her problem  Her judgment  On him  How trustworthy  This guy is  Should she have said  You know something  I got a pretty good job  Here fella  Maybe I'm not ready  To give it up  Yeah but he promised  To marry her  So she's like  I'm going to have  This life with this guy  And he just dumps her 
[01:39:30]  I love Jimmy playing  The reasonable voice  I swear  I want to take  His cute face  And smush  I want to squeeze it  Why  It's kissable  I know it is  I'm adorable  When I shave  Squeeze it  Maybe it's time  That men start realizing  The ramifications  Of their actions  Yeah  You know  Yeah  I mean for too long  Women have been  Dragged into these  Kind of situations  With no recourse  From the criminal justice  Or the legal justice  Legal system  I think this is a good thing  I think this is a movement  In the right direction  This is good  This is good 
[01:40:00]  Precedent setting thing  This is great  Let's have a cage match  Ant and I  Versus you two  Let's go  Let's go  It depends on what  Geraldo has done  That morning  Yeah  If he's healthy  Alright  It might be a good one  But if he's on one  Of his wonderful runs  I take me and Geraldo  Anytime  I'll just stand behind him  And watch him  Tasmanian devil  We got David Duchovny  He's walking up the stairs  So you want to get  To the end of this clip  Or you want to just wait  Walking up the stairs  Where  Let's do that  The elevator you mean  They said stairs  Where 
[01:40:30]  It's very healthy  I don't know  Take the stairs  I did a good paying job  Yes  I'm moving  Yes  A lot of things  And you know  I just felt like  People shouldn't be allowed  To do people that way  You know  Wayne Gibbs  Your ex-fiance  Has said that  One of the reasons  He broke off the engagement  Is because  When you moved back  To be with him  He paid off a lot  Of your debt  And then realized  You had even more debt  And that gave him  Cold feet  Decided maybe  I'm not going to  Go all the way here  And marry this woman  What's your reaction to that? 
[01:41:00]  That's simply not true  We discussed my debts  Before I left Florida  We discussed my debts  When I came back  From Florida  He had a list  He knew exactly  What I owed  So there is debt  That's just kind of  A smokescreen  He put up  Smokescreen?  Oh  She goes  No that's simply not true  We discussed the debts  Oh  So you're admitting  There were debts  That he did pay  Ugh  This leech  Just to take  You know how you get rid of her  You gotta grab her  Close to your skin  And then put a cigarette butt 
[01:41:30]  On her ass  So the head  Doesn't break off  Under your skin  And get infected  You're a tick  We gotta get  The guy on our show  Yeah  Can we hunt him down?  Yeah look for a man  Crying  He'll have a different  Story to show  We got more audio  Normally I would agree  Against it  But if the guy  Promised to marry her  And the thing  That convinces me  Is that she gave up  The job  And if you give up  That kind of money  And the guy  Just backs out  It's like  I thought you were kidding  All this time  You're not really kidding  I was playing along 
[01:42:00]  Jimmy is just  A douche  Why?  Because how could you  Even defend this woman?  I'm not actually  I know it's a weird  Position to take  But it's like  The job  The job  It's the role  Even if you agree  That she's right  Even if you agree  That she's right  The question is  How could she have  Access to the courts  These are our tax dollars  So this is a system  The governmental system  Is now being used  To settle private  Nonsense like this  I mean  If she would have 
[01:42:30]  Gotten married  And left the job  That's one thing  I don't even agree  With that  But you know  At least she'd have  A leg to stand on  In this one  A promise  Like yeah look  We're going to have  This great life together  We're going to get married  You leave your job  You come out  You move with me  It's going to be great  Yeah  That's what everyone  Says in marriage  It's not like  Hey don't leave your job  Because I don't know  What the hell  Where this is going  Yeah  It's supposed to be  All full of sparkles  And romance at that point  We should explain  We got David Duchovny  In studio  David  While we were waiting  For you  We played audio 
[01:43:00]  I want to get your  Take on this real fast  Then we'll get into  The X-Files and stuff  Is it me?  No no no nothing  We have a  All right good  We have a  It's not on TV anymore  We have this woman  She was going to get married  And the guy  At the last second  Decided he needs to bail  He's like  He didn't feel good  About the situation  She had some debt  And we're thinking  Maybe some other things  Were going on  She turned around  And got a lawyer  The guy  For backing out  Of the marriage  They weren't married  She won $150,000  It doesn't make sense 
[01:43:30]  There was no contract  It was just a verbal  They weren't even married yet  I promised and she  Did give up a good job  Jimmy I'm going to  Smack you in the head  Promise?  You promised?  Yeah  I mean it's like a contract  It's a verbal contract  In a way  What is a verbal contract?  Well like she  Agreed to move  And relocate for him  He's just a liar  But do you get  Is that illegal?  Well not illegal  But he's up there  Put in jail  But he is being  Taken to task  Thank God  The voice of reason  David  I would like it better  If he went to jail  For fibbing 
[01:44:00]  For telling a fib  But it's setting  A precedent now  Now you can get sued  Before you even get married  Then you just can't  Make a promise  When someone's got  A $150,000 job  On the line  Shut up  I don't like the way  We don't know  If he's  What about if  He's not blessing us  Or what  But he's unkind  I don't think he is  I don't think he is  He plays the devil's advocate  All the time  And I want to really smash him  We have to  David Duchovny obviously  Is doing the new  The new X-Files  X-Files movie  I got to start though  By saying  Why did you come back  Because it went horribly wrong 
[01:44:30]  The last time you were here  Did it?  Because he came in  To promote Californication  Right  None of us saw it  And we were just sitting here  Like the X-Files movie  And you're like  I don't want to talk about that  Right  I'm not talking about that  I want to talk about Californication  Right  And it was a weird interview  But I think we had a good time  Yeah  Now I'm prepared to  I was going to sue you afterwards  It wasn't as good a time  As I wanted to have  But this is the beauty of us  A verbal contract was made  This is the beauty of us  You're here to promote  The X-Files movie  I am so prepared 
[01:45:00]  To talk about Californication now  I'll talk about anything you want  Whatever you want  I got the DVD of the first season  Yeah  And I feel really bad  That I didn't watch it  Before you came in the last time  Because I love the show  On Showtime  Yeah  Yeah  We just finished the second season  A couple days ago  And I think it's even funnier  And better than the first season  Really?  Yeah  And I'm amazed by all the women  You get the bang in this series  And I wonder if your wife  Has a problem with this  Even though it's acting  Because you're completely naked  In front of these women 
[01:45:30]  That are completely naked  With ridiculous bodies  Well, no  You always wear a cock sock  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  Which is  I just like saying that  Who doesn't?  Can we clean that up?  Because that's pretty fun  He's got something that he  I'm wearing one right now  Yeah  He's got something that he puts on  When he's doing the sex scene  It's a special sock you have to wear  To say they're in sex scenes  Where nothing will really happen  And mine is usually argyle  Like an argyle  Oh, that's good  Yeah  It blends in  Yeah  Yeah, you know  Actors always say this  And you always think it's bold 
[01:46:00]  But it's actually true  That the sex scenes  Are usually like the opposite of sexy  Because they're choreographed  And usually for camera  Your genitals end up  Around her belly button  You know  And that looks like real  And things like that  So it's not  And I'm so  We're all so conscious  Of the women  Or whoever's on the show  Is comfortable  Doing what they're doing  Because it's not easy  To come onto a set  And do something like that  You're good  You told this to your lady  Didn't you?  You're good 
[01:46:30]  You're good  You're good  She's an actress  So she knows  You know, she knows  And I'll tell you how  You guys are really smart  Because I got the  You know, the DVD  And I'm like  You know what  I'm going to give this a try  Right  The first episode  Had so many hot women naked  I'm like  How could you not watch this show  At this point?  Yeah  And one of the opening scenes  Is this girl Mia  That in the middle  Of having sex with you  She punches you in the face  Twice  Twice  And then we learn  That she's underage  You didn't know  Your character didn't know  Right  And we also learn  That it's the little girl  From that old show 
[01:47:00]  The Nanny  How could you not watch  Californication?  I didn't know that  Oh you didn't?  And actually when we were  Shooting the X-Files movie  In Canada  I was on a treadmill  Or something  And one of the old nannies  Was on it  And I felt really bad  That's dirty  Oh is that filthy  And yet I kept watching  Well Mia  Her name's Mia  In the show  And she's  Madeline Zima  She's beautiful  Yeah  She's really tall too  She grew up  Yeah  For me it's the second punch  That is the best  Right  Because you get punched once 
[01:47:30]  It's you know  It's kind of sick and funny  And twice  It's just  It's just funny  Yeah  I'm just trying to do  A make good  I mean Californication  Is great  Was it even out  When I came in here  I don't know if you  Even had the chance  I thought it was  I thought it  Yeah  You know  Whatever  Well thank you  I appreciate it  Did the first season  End as a dream  Well I'm  You don't want to say  Obviously  I don't want to say  That's for the insiders  The reason that  Tom Kapanos  The creator of the show  Did that  Is we didn't know  By the time we were  Shooting the last episode  Of last season  We didn't know 
[01:48:00]  If we were picked up  Or not  So he wanted to  To make it  So that if we didn't  Get picked up  It would just  Function as an entity  You know  Like a story  From start to finish  So  You know  We got put in this box  At the end  By getting us back together  But that's always good  In television  Is to challenge yourself  By you know  Tying up your loose ends  And you have to make new ones  It's going to end up  Being a dream  Because you got the second season  I'm not saying  All right  I have a question for you too  When you came up  A Roland's our guy  He takes care of  All the slippers  Roland  Yeah  He gave me Lego  And I'm 
[01:48:30]  You know  It's weird  When a grown man  Gives you Lego  Yeah but  But my kid  I'm a hero now  I'm just going to  Send that off  And you know  For me getting Lego  Roland  Could you come here  Because we heard about this  How big of a  Would you mind if Roland  Not at all  Roland's a super fan  But I think he's being polite  You don't want a box of Legos  No no I do  You could get Legos  For your kids  He should have gave you  A gift card  He can't  Lego is  It's harder to get  Than anything  In the world  No but I gave him a card though  That he could get  Whatever he wants 
[01:49:00]  At any time  For how much  Anything  It's a little like crack  It's a little like  The first one's free  Wow  Yeah  You got him a Lego gift card  No if my friend's a VP  Of Lego  So whatever he wants  Anytime free  VP of Lego  How do you know  Someone who works at Lego  What's wrong with you  I should have known  They designed the little  People after you  You kind of look like  That Lego guy  That's great  So you love David  Yeah I love the X-Files  Thank you  Well who doesn't  Which is awesome  And way better than Batman 
[01:49:30]  Well yeah  Batman is some crazy  Kind of phenomenon  So what I want to tell people  Is if Batman is sold out  It's perfectly fine  And actually okay  That's smart  If you buy an X-Files ticket  And sneak back into Batman  That's good with me  I don't care  What movie you watch  Just buy the X-Files ticket  I'll just say this  Aaron Heckhart  Is Harvey Dent  And Two-Face  There you go  Now go see the X-Files  Wow  What are you doing  Big spoiler 
[01:50:00]  Just blurt it out  So people go see  The X-Files  I sat next to Roland  At The Dark Knight  And he loved the movie  Yeah  You really liked this  David Duchovny  The hardcore people  Should have seen it already  I didn't love the movie  Here's a spoiler for me  Batman  Also Bruce Wayne  No way  I would never know  Because he sounded so different  I'm Batman  That's terrific  Heath Ledger spit on you  After every take  That's awful  Where are we gonna catch  The joke 
[01:50:30]  Shut up  Horrendous  Why is my girlfriend  So unattractive  Why is he attacking  His mother and sister  He should be punching  His acting coach  Yeah do the gravelly voice  Thing that worked  I'm gonna get you  I'm the richest guy  In New York City  But my girlfriend's  In a ass face  Let me just say  That David Duchovny  Left  Yes  Of course  We know how you guys are  He wasn't involved  With that  Now the movie  Obviously  A lot of people curious  Do you have to be 
[01:51:00]  A fan of the show  Do you have to have  Seen the previous movie  Or is this kind of  Stand alone  It's a stand alone  You know  When we came out  To publicize  The last movie  Which was ten years ago  And six years  Since we finished  The show on television  We had these  Marching orders  To let people know  That you don't  You don't have to  Have seen the show  To enjoy the movie  And it was bull  You know  That was  We all knew it was bull  It was a lie  But we went out there  And lied anyway  Because you know  People just lie  When they're publicizing stuff  But this time  I'm not lying 
[01:51:30]  I won't come back here  In six years  And tell you  That I was lying  You can actually  Enjoy the film  And should enjoy the film  Without knowing anything  About the characters  A little odd  I read a few reviews  That came out  And one of them  Was like  It was a little odd  Because there isn't  Really an alien tie in  No there's no alien tie in  That's one of the  Attempts to make it  A stand alone  A stand alone  Yeah  Because then you'd have  To know the whole  Back story  Of Mulder  And that god damn  Sister that just  Took up your whole life  You know something  At some point  Gotta get over  The sister thing 
[01:52:00]  And just kind of move on  Well one thing  He's doing for closures  He's gonna sue the aliens  That's a good idea  Litigate  Just litigate  With the aliens  We had a couple guys  Were they producers  From the X-Files  Oh Frank and Chris  Well you  Jimmy  We have a moment  For you David  Oh yeah  You'll never come back  This is horrible  You'll never come back  There wasn't a bad moment  I'm a huge fan  We started promoting  The X-Files movie  A while ago  Right  And we had Chris Carter  In actually  And Frank Spotnitz 
[01:52:30]  Yes Frank Spotnitz  Right  And Jimmy  Really wasn't sure  Who  Who they were  Who they were  So we're talking about  We're talking about  The X-Files movie  And you know  They're not fessing up  To much of anything  They're not giving any info  Out on storyline  Or anything like that  And Jimmy  Started asking them questions  As if they were  Actors  Like I believe  He thought  One of them  Was Mulder  I didn't know  I thought they were  Both in the show  You know  I think one of them  Does think he's Mulder  We got a 
[01:53:00]  We got a quick clip  It's worth playing  Oh you got this  Yes  Hey  Do you guys  When you're  In between  You got six years  Between doing films  Are you doing  Theater and stuff  Like that  A lot of actors  Just get so bored  With being in the same role  All the time  They just want to go out  And like you know  Gandalfini wants to go out  And do some weird  That's what he asked them  That's him  What did I say  As far as  Dave and Jillian go  You know  The people that act  In the movie  Yeah  Chris Carter's off  Doing Broadway 
[01:53:30]  You idiot  He's in Mamma Mia  That would have been  A bad question  To the actors  Right  To the actual actors  He didn't like my  Melt  Hella stutter  Nervous idiot  And then we have  The clip where you  Discover that they  Really don't act  Those are the creators  Right  Yep  Well Jimmy  Jimmy  Jimmy seemed to be  Under the impression  They were actors  A lot of people  In instant feedback  Said that too  Oh they weren't actors  I have no idea  Who they were 
[01:54:00]  Do you find yourself  Are you kidding me  And they were looking  At him like  What are you talking about  I don't know  Did you do any  Broadway  I was wondering  Why  Chris Carter  Doing rent  I was wondering  Why you kept  Talking about  The other actors  Chris Carter  Is the creator  Of the X-Files  Good for me  Alright  The instant feedback  Was accurate  I have no idea  The instant feedback  Was coming in  And a lot of people  Going  I think Jimmy  Thinks that they're actors  I thought they were  The two leads  In the show  Oh my god  That's hysterical 
[01:54:30]  Are you kidding  That would be hysterical  What a dope  That's like asking  Oliver Stone  So do you  Do you act in theater  When you're not starring  In the movies  What a f*** I am  But they didn't call me  Out on it either  Well they were being polite  They were embarrassed  For you  You know  It would be nice  There's like a feeling  In the room right now  Silent revulsion  No  I secretly  I'm very pleased  Oh it was hysterical  Because they were just like  Oh no this guy  Has no clue who we are  I'm trying to figure out  Which one's Scully  And which one's  Yeah  I don't  I don't see where  The sexual tension 
[01:55:00]  Comes from  Yeah  You know something  Speaking of that  I see in the trailer  Might be a little  Might be a little romance  Going on  Oh yeah  It's been six years  You know  What woman  You know  You keep knocking at that door  For six years  Eventually it's going to open  Something's got to happen  Yeah  And how was that  Getting on set  Being the character again  Honestly it was great  It was  You know  You don't want to do  An imitation of yourself  It was nice to be able to  You know  Have this guy six years later  Did you do that  You kind of advanced yourself 
[01:55:30]  What you thought  Mulder would be like  With six years under his belt  Exactly  And what has the character  Been doing  Well that's the thing  He hasn't been doing  What he's supposed to be doing  So this  The movie kind of tracks him  From being a guy  Who's not doing  What he should be doing  Which is being Mulder  To a guy  You know  Finding his passion again  For what he does  Yeah  It's kind of a nice arc  That way  Still got a penchant  For pornography  And all that stuff  Me personally  Or Mulder  Well both  There's no porn  In the movie  Oh okay  Unfortunately 
[01:56:00]  But you know  If there's a sequel  We hope to take it to Hollywood  Yeah  Mulder liked his porno  That's all  There was one  It was once written  In one of the shows  That you know  Because Mulder  Occasionally did watch  The videos  Back then  They were videos  Yeah  Before DVD  But it was written  That Mulder  Was actually masturbating  Watching a video  Of Sasquatch  And we actually shot it  And you know  You can never put that  On that one  So the scene  Is actually  Just Mulder  Looking at a video  Of Sasquatch  Under the covers  Kind of tucked up tight 
[01:56:30]  But we actually  Seriously shot that  Because we thought  Maybe we'll be able  To get that on  Yeah sure  And then I was like  Well is Sasquatch  Male or female  Is Mulder gay  I don't know  Wouldn't matter  It's just Sasquatch  He likes  The hairy thing  Hey Roland  You got a question  You're a fanboy  Yeah you love David  Come on  Give us a good question  Not a deep inside question  Something that the audience  I'm just excited  That the ex-wives  Are coming out today  To go see  Miss work 
[01:57:00]  I would  That's not a good question  I don't know  That's a question  I don't know  I blanked out  Hey David  You can make his  You can make his day  Could you just tickle him  Where here  Like a side  Give him a  I'm serious  If you just grab a  Listen to that  You just made his weak  That is the worst laugh  A man should have  Do a lot of people  Tickle him  Oh yeah  Because the laugh  Is  It's my shame  It's my shame  Don't be ashamed 
[01:57:30]  Don't be ashamed  It's true  God gave me feminine laugh  Don't worry about it  Don't worry about it  It's kind of fun to do right  I think it's nice  Yeah  I wish I could giggle like that  And be tickled  How about  I wish I could laugh  Like Truman Capote on helium  Yeah  Roland it's your moment  One question  One question  Do do do  I  Was it  You got your Emmy  At the same asylum  On the set of X-Files  Golden Globe  Golden Globe 
[01:58:00]  Golden Globe  So now that you  So there was a yes or no question  Yeah  Now that you said  The wrong award  How was your Oscar  You're doing the X-Men  You're just trying  You're the guy that thinks  Carter and Spottnitz  Or Mulder and Scully  I know I'm a dope  But it's just funny  Watching Roland  Because Roland  Loves everything about you  How about an inside question  Something that none of us  Would think to ask  Because Roland is  A David expert  Well you put him on the spot  Maybe he would come back to you  Look at him sweating  He's sweating  I blinked out  What about 
[01:58:30]  How is Jillian  Hopping back into the  The character  She was great  And actually  I did two weeks  Before Jillian showed up  Working  And it was kind of awkward  And then finally  When Jillian and I  Started working together  It actually just all clicked in  For both of us  Being Mulder and Scully  And you know  When we were doing the show  It was nine years together  And it's no secret  We kind of  Couldn't stand each other  For periods of time  But you know  Now that's all gone  And forgotten  And when we get together  It's just  We really appreciate one another  And you know  Nine years we spent together 
[01:59:00]  And you know  I just love her  In a certain way  You know  Any inside  Quickly  Sorry Jim  Any inside little jokes  About like cell phones  Or things like that  Because you guys  Your cell phones  Were hysterically funny  Back then  When we first started  The cell phone  Was like a brick  Yeah  Yeah  Huge brick  And it became  Very funny  Well yeah  And that was  A running joke  But the truth was  Without the cell phone  Both of us would have  Quit earlier  Because the cell phone  Enabled us to be  Have days off 
[01:59:30]  Because you know  We could talk  Right right  You're back and forth  In different locations  Right  Now the cell phone  Is getting smaller  I don't know what else  I would just think  Go see this movie  For the small cell phone  For the small cell phone  Now I just think  That there were  So many little things  That people paid attention to  That with time passing by  You could actually look back  And kind of goof on those things  You know  In a way  Maybe I should have written  A couple of things  For the movie  Well you could have  If only you know  The creator was in  Yeah  You should have  You're asking the actor 
[02:00:00]  About the writing  You ask the crew  I know  What started you  Just like  Like how long  Were you together  Working together  Before like  One of you went  Like ugh  You know  It takes a couple years  I mean you guys  You guys seem to get along  But there must be times  When you can't stand  Each other no  Just Monday through Friday  Yeah  Sometimes the weekends  Yeah  It's just  It's just a matter  Of just working so hard  Together for so long  That you know  It's just become  I'm a very moody person  And if you were a saint 
[02:00:30]  Working next to me  I would probably work up  A pretty good hatred for you  Really?  I'm sure it all came from me  Wow  But you just kind of sense it  And all of a sudden  You start dreading  Doing scenes together  No no  That's the weird thing  Is like whenever  There were  I remember there were  A couple weeks  Where we weren't really  Speaking to one another  And  But then we'd do  Then we'd do a scene  And it was great  You know  And we'd speak to one another  And you know  Love on one another  Like we do with  Muller and Scully  Do you watch those scenes  And go like  God we weren't  Even dealing with each other  Yeah I don't remember  You know exactly when 
[02:01:00]  Or where it was  But it is amazing to me  And  You know  I guess we were both  Professional  And still made it happen  But you know  At this point  I just really love  And appreciate her  And I'm glad  You know  That we're not  In that kind of  Intense situation  Where  Where everybody  Kind of loses their mind  A lot of excitement  For the X-Files movie  We got  Jose from Brooklyn  He's got a question  For David  Jose  David  How you doing  I'm good Jose  How are you  Hey listen  I gotta tell you 
[02:01:30]  I wasn't a big fan  Of the X-Files  But I love  Telefonication  I thought you were awesome  And the funniest episode  I think was the one  With the squirter  How on earth  Did you get that chick  To make it seem  Like she was having  A live orgasm  Like that  Oh well  That's  You know  We actually had  We actually  Had a little  Hose  Honestly  We had a little hose  Cut out  Into the bed  So it was like  Almost like a little 
[02:02:00]  Like you do  With insects  Like that kind  Like a little nozzle  And it was  It was coming up  Through the bed  And it was between  Her legs  And Evan Handler  Who plays  Charlie Runkle  Is pleasuring her orally  And she  Ejaculates  So  Oh we're so  That's not  Worry about it  You can't say that  You used to be able to  But go ahead  Dumb radio  It's okay  I mean other things  Don't hear it  So  So the 
[02:02:30]  The spray comes out  It's perfect  The first time  Hits Evan right in the face  And it's a great take  But you know  You always go again  Just for safety  Or whatever  And after that  The hose just went crazy  And at one take  You know  The two women  Come in the door  And see this all happening  And one take  The door opens  And they just  They got sprayed  Like six feet  Diagonally  Stop you're spilling it  It's like footage  From Mississippi  In 1965  Hey what can you tell us  About the second season  There's none of that 
[02:03:00]  Particular type of action  But there's a lot  Of other type of action  And you know  As the character  As more  Becomes at stake  For the characters  It's always funnier  And you know  Now that we've got  Some history to draw  Between the relationships  And the characters  And what they want  It just gets deeper  And funnier  And you know  What I love about the character  Is he really wants to be  With this one woman  And because  Well he gets together  With him  But because  It's so difficult  That he just goes  A little crazy  And I like the idea 
[02:03:30]  Of playing this character  Who's kind of  He's kind of  Sentimentally romantic  On the one hand  And then can't say no  On the other  Yeah banging everything  In sight on the other  Oh you can say banging  But not ejaculating  Yeah  I think  For some reason  Who knows  It's all context  Yeah  Ridiculous  I think we've got to  Get him out of here  Unfortunately  You're a busy man today  Yeah you're all over  The place today  I could stay here all day  Roland  Sure  I heard you're producing  America Dreamers  When does that come out  My wife is  Yeah  Yeah

[02:07:30]  With his fiancee  That was jilted  And then  Hey, she got screwed over  I mean, I normally  Wouldn't take that  Tact  You  Taking her side  But I'm not completely  Is infuriating me  I know it's funny  But I'm actually not  But there's something to it  That we don't know  Cause you can't just  No, there isn't  This is gonna set a precedent  That  She was promised something  That didn't happen  And it didn't happen  That's life  It's called life  You can't then say  I won $100,000 
[02:08:00]  Because it didn't pan out  No, but she's not saying that  Cause she gave up the job  That's the only difference  It's not like she's saying  Who can't?  She gave up the job  They weren't married  That's what  The decision  The decision she made  She made a life decision  If every life decision I made  That went down the crapper  I was able to sue for  I would never have  Needed this radio job  I've been rich years ago  Forget about it  You make decisions in life  A lot of times  More times than not  They suck  Well, you guys want to hear the lawyer? 
[02:08:30]  Okay  Yeah  I thought  That she was entitled  To the money  Sick of  Effing lawyers too  Hey, the lawyer got her $150,000  Gold of my ear was her lawyer  Her lawyer, Bella Abzo  Got her $150,000  Got her $150,000 
[02:09:00]  And they weren't married  Here's the lawyer  What he has to say  Lydia, I've never heard of a case like this  Where somebody can  You know  Somebody basically  Jilting them, right  And end up with this kind of award  Because engagements  As I said  Are broken all the time  So what convinced the jury  That Rosemary deserved this settlement?  It's really not an unusual case  It's not unheard of  And there's this cause of action  In states across the country  Here, we were, of course, concerned about it 
[02:09:30]  Because Gainesville Hall County  Is a very conservative area  Very Republican  Juries are conservative  And render conservative verdicts  And so we really debated  Quite extensively  Whether to bring the case  But we just felt so strongly  That in this case  He had told her to quit her job  In reliance on his promise  He came to her in Florida  And moved her back into his house  Took steps above and beyond 
[02:10:00]  The usual, will you marry me?  Let's plan a wedding  And then somebody backs out  Here, he caused her to do things  In reliance on his promise  He knew he was having her do it  And really, we believe now  That he never intended to follow through  On the promise to marry  Don't believe any of that  First of all  It's coming from a lawyer  You should see what they say  You should just see  What they write down as fact  And you read it  And go, what fantasy novel is this? 
[02:10:30]  And I'd like to hear  His stupid lawyer's side of it too  It's only the fact that  It's like she's saying  The jury said yes  So there must have been  He must have promised her other stuff  You know what I mean?  It's like they didn't just say  Well, he broke off the engagement  She gave up her job  And on his promise  He moved her in  And then, look, the jury said  Look, you're liable for that  You can't just have somebody  Quit their job  And uproot their life  Yeah, but the problem is  Sounds like Jimmy wants to open  The floodgates of litigation  Yes  No  You're on a slippery slope, my friend 
[02:11:00]  Slippery slope  Perdition  I want to see how Jimmy  Spins the next piece of audio  But I'm not even spinning  That's just my take on this  You're spinning  You're spinning  Like the little Jimmy  Out in the outfield  You're spinning  Lately  Do you think this is going to  Set a precedent?  Uh-oh  I hope it sets a precedent  Die!  Evil bitch  Die!  Yes  Shame  You hope 
[02:11:30]  Look  I mean, I know it's stupid  But why should that woman  Have given up her job  And moved  And uprooted everything  If the guy had no intention  But even if she shouldn't have  Why should it be legally enforceable?  That's the point  Because then  Any single person  Anytime you break off a relationship  A person could make the argument  That they gave up a lot  Because they were expecting you  To marry them  And that means  Every single person  Has a potential lawsuit  Now, every broken marriage  Has a potential lawsuit  Every broken engagement  Or relationship  Or any promise 
[02:12:00]  What about a promise  From an employer  Let's say  That says  Alright, we'd like to hire you  You kind of relocate  And then  Massive cutbacks  Or something happens  There was a scandal  In the company  Now you gotta move back  Do you sue the company?  Is that what happens?  It's different though  Everyone gets sued  Why is that different?  It was a promise  That was made?  Hey  She moved  She gave up  A $100,000 a year  It's like  I know  It's like  It's a lot of money 
[02:12:30]  To give up  On this guy  Then she's stupid  Her judgment is bad  Why give her $100,000  Because she's got  Crappy judgment  He said he would help her  Pay off  It's almost  I know what you mean  Like you can't sue  For a personal infraction  But  So he's given her money  To pay off her debt anyway  Yeah  And because it's not enough  It's not good enough  He should pay her more money  This is such garbage  It's such  Enabling  The feeble woman  Who can't take care of herself  Who made a stupid decision 
[02:13:00]  But blame it on the man  Because women are much too stupid  To take responsibility  For their own decisions  It's  It's  This is more demeaning  To women  Than any glass ceiling  Sexual harassment  Or other bull  That  These lawyers  That latch onto these women  Try to  Pull over on guys  Let's get this clip  Out of the way  Something else is going to happen here  That's going to  You know  Piss you off  Do you think this is going to set a precedent?  I hope it sets a precedent  With folks 
[02:13:30]  That when you contract  Where you give your word  To do something  And you cause people to rely on it  To their detriment  Then you may be held accountable  For any damages that you cause  I mean that's really not a precedent  We've been living by that  You know  Forever  Alright  It's important  Moser I know that you have the ring there  In the box  So you held on to the engagement ring  Does it hurt?  Do you know how much that is worth?  Stand her 
[02:14:00]  Bravo  Bravo  You held on to the engagement ring  Can we take a look?  Do you know how much that is worth?  No I really don't  I'm sure it's worth a lot  I've heard different amounts  Are you going to sell it?  Yes  Most definitely  Means nothing now  Alright well Rosemary  Thank you so much for joining us  Lydia  Throw it away or give it back  If it's nothing  If it means nothing now  Give it back to the guy at least  Excuse me  She promised me  She promised me  Jobs 
[02:14:30]  For the entire course of our engagement  And then subsequent marriage  Please  I would like $100,000 worth of jobs please  I relied on it to my detriment  I stopped touching myself  Exactly  I've experienced severe build up  I'm sure there were promises she made to him  That aren't going to be carried out  You can't uproot somebody's life  We're not listening anymore  I will not listen to Jimmy's feeble  Feeble argument  The fact 
[02:15:00]  I am a good  The fact that anybody could believe  That I would side  With this pig  The fact  It was  It started as a goof  Like I figured I'd play devil's advocate  Nobody would buy it  And then all of a sudden  I watched you get annoyed  And it was like  Oh this is wonderful  I love  I love  Jimmy Norton  This woman  Should not only get no money  She should have an axe  Buried in her chest  How could you think  I would side  With this 
[02:15:30]  This pig  This is how unpredictable  Jim Norton is  She's awful  And that  And that lawyer  Is awful  You know what though  In a weird way  She does have a point  Yeah she does  She does  It should be a fake cone  Under her shirt  Because one is missing  That should be the point she has  This blight on society  Did you just say a blight  A blight  No blight  The boss would say blight  Because he likes Dan  You know that woman  We gotta get out of here 
[02:16:00]  I hate this woman  I don't want anybody  Thinking I sided with her  That new company  Thinks I'm a liberal fruit  I was kidding  If he's listening  Greg Giraldo  Thank you  Thank you man  We're gonna see you  A week from tomorrow  Yeah  And in 10 minutes  You're gonna have  A really good time  Yeah  We're gonna continue  On XM with Greg  PNC Bank Art Center  Next Saturday  Get your tickets now  Okay  I hate that woman  I know  Thank you Jimmy  I had to get this out  I've been lying for an hour  Thank you Jimmy  She should get nothing  Of course  A fist right in her ribs  There you go 
[02:16:30]  Give the ring back pig  At least give the ring back  Exactly  She should get nothing  And give the ring back  Yep  Hopefully it'll be overturned  Yeah I hope so  She'll feel that  Forced to copulate  With a donkey  Oh did you  Ask me  I had a song  You were stoned with me 
[02:17:00]  A couple times I saw you smile  That I thought  But I thought  It was a thing  I didn't know  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  The Opie and Anthony Show  XM 202  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks  The biggest are Opie and Anthony  These people say  Shocking things  That border on offensive  In order to entertain their office  I refuse to sit here  And think that radio 
[02:17:30]  Has to be nice  Why  Why does radio  Out of any other medium  Have to be nice  We are being now held  To a standard  Where we have to be nice  And make people feel good  Go screw  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  Controversial radio personalities  Opie and Anthony  Infamous DJs  Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio hosts  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony 
[02:18:00]  Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  So you've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  Ricky and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off  so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[02:18:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  By the way, we've got a big crowd outside.  Yeah, you can clap.  Oh, yeah.  We like that.  It gives us energy, especially on a Friday.  A live studio audience, yes.  Greg Giraldo made the walk over to XM.  And as we got closer to XM,  we see a little Asian fella outside the studio 
[02:19:00]  just sitting there looking a bit confused,  waiting for us.  I'm not that little.  Because I think you need some answers, huh?  Bobby Lee?  Yeah, well, yesterday you guys were deceiving me, man.  Some deception and some trickery.  But you're still not sure that we were deceiving you.  No, dude.  I was freaking out.  I know.  You're the star of a really good YouTube video right now.  Sam's filmed the whole thing,  and it's up there right now.  At first, when did that start happening? 
[02:19:30]  Were you freaked out for the rest of the day?  Because you ran out of here.  No, I couldn't sleep last night.  You ran out of here.  And then I got angry at you guys.  I'm like...  Oh, no.  We were starting...  Not you, Jim.  We were thinking about letting you in on the whole thing,  and all of a sudden, you were in an elevator and gone.  So we're like, oh, well, sucks to be him.  Let me let you in on something, though.  You would think if we were good guys,  we would try to get a hold of you and let you off the hook.  Well, that's why I came by to apologize for leaving.  It was weird.  No, when you're mad at the show,  you're really...  I'll let you in on something. 
[02:20:00]  You're really just mad at Opie.  No.  See, that's how it works.  I got my fans.  Not everyone hates me.  No, I'm just saying,  when the guest is mad because something is happening,  it's usually perpetrated by Opie.  The funny part, too,  is that Jimmy has the same reaction every time.  In the video, you're just kind of covering your face  and just hoping it goes away.  We all react differently.  I'm a codependent slob.  Here's the video.  What is it under? 
[02:20:30]  I want to send people to YouTube,  not Foundry, because, you know...  Stop it.  Send to Foundry.  I'm sure it's on opanthony.com as well.  But, Sam, what's the search on YouTube?  We like when we have a hot YouTube video.  Oh, good.  It's already watermarked.  Oh, my God.  Of course it is.  If you search...  I am little.  I am little.  Bobby Lee has a panic attack.  Yeah.  You should be able to get it.  The username is erokfan.  Yeah, okay.  There's Bobby.  He's trying to, like, tell us that the console's moving.  And we're like,  what are you talking about?  He's like, dude, I saw the... 
[02:21:00]  Look, he's jumping up and down.  He just needs to leave the studio.  And look at Jimmy's...  There's going to be a shot of Jimmy  where Jimmy's just trying to cover his face.  He doesn't want to be part of this nonsense.  I'm too busy looking at the Pronounced Foundry logo  while Opie and Anthony is buried at the top  of the fucking cursive.  Of course.  Do I look coked out?  Were you?  No.  People want to know if you were on something yesterday.  No, no, no, no, no.  We have a lot of questions for you as well.  No, but I told you I'm sober.  Yeah.  All right.  You sure looked it yesterday. 
[02:21:30]  And then we're trying to tell you  that the studio's shaking  and then the TVs went off  and then, like, it got dark in here.  The lights got dark  and then the crane telling him  the crane is going to fall.  Look at Jimmy.  Yeah.  He's trying to ignore  what's happening around him  and he's just checking email  on his iPhone.  He just...  Yeah, it was a little off.  Oh, my God.  So you can check out the video.  Yeah.  So what happened after you left the show  and ran out of here? 
[02:22:00]  I went and ate  and then I slept for like six hours.  And then I woke up,  I'm like,  I'm never going to go back on that show.  I think there was some trickery going on.  Some trickery.  And then what happened was  when I went to Caroline's  and then the place was packed  and then I realized that  you guys had helped me do that.  So I decided to come back  and apologize.  Not so much trickery.  Trickery sounds mean-spirited.  They were shenanigans.  Oh, shenanigans.  Shenanigans are being played on you.  Yes.  That's more fun-spirited, I think.  Fun, yeah. 
[02:22:30]  And Bobby died.  And Bobby...  Thank you.  Okay, then it might be trickery.  My chest hurt so bad  and then I started getting paranoid  and it must internally collapse.  Wow.  So, is that shenanigans?  No, now it's trickery.  It's trickery, right?  It's almost an unintentional homicide.  I do appreciate that Bobby realizes  that he does need to apologize.  Yeah, I apologize.  You guys are hoping, Anthony...  You could have died  and made it a real classic moment.  Yeah.  I want to hear some of your audio  from yesterday. 
[02:23:00]  We cut up a few highlights.  We got to walk the people through this  because the video is hot right now.  And I want to get to the rabbit thing,  but let's start with...  What was that, though?  Did you plan that?  I'm not saying shit right now, my friend.  No, my friend,  when rabbits appear in panic attacks,  it's not good.  Nah, that's really bad.  I know you ran out of the studio  trying to find the rabbit  and you never found the rabbit.  Never found him, no.  And that really freaked you out, too, right?  And then people started leaving?  What was that all about? 
[02:23:30]  He needs answers.  It really got weird.  Yeah.  You're right.  Why don't we walk through the people...  Let's walk through everybody  while Bobby's here  and he can give us some more info  on the whole thing.  This all started  because I looked over to Bobby Lee  while we were discussing something else  and I noticed you were freaking out  and you were in the middle  of a panic attack.  Your face went beet red  and you were sweating profusely  and you were getting up  and I'm like,  wow, what's wrong with him?  And then we decided,  well, we have to kind of go with this thing.  What?  It started with this. 
[02:24:00]  Bobby suddenly freaks out.  You did?  No, because I'm on Kimmel.  That's why.  You best not fuck.  Bobby, where are you going?  He's turning...  You all right?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I started having a panic attack, man.  Why?  No, I started breathing.  I started sweating.  I got a guy.  Yeah.  Why are you panicking?  I started...  I had a breathing thing.  So we'll fucking deal with it.  Xanax or something wrong?  No, I just started getting like...  He's sweating.  He turned red.  They're not coming in.  They're fine.  He was freaking out  because we weren't talking about him.  No, that's not what it was, man. 
[02:24:30]  The whole day game,  cooking,  and then all of a sudden  I didn't know what was going on.  You want a Vicodin?  Oh, jeez.  Dude, he's sweating really bad.  I'm kidding.  Your color came back.  Well, you were a different color.  You were red.  I was pink and now I'm yellow again.  Oh, that bombed.  No.  I just sat there.  That's the warm-up.  That's when we noticed,  all right,  we might be able to fuck with this guy.  We don't know him,  so what the hell?  Let's go with this.  And then we really wanted  to take advantage of the fact  you might have been having  a panic attack.  Bobby,  you know what's really weird  about this studio? 
[02:25:00]  What?  There's a fucking 40-story crane  right outside this building.  And man,  if one of those brackets goes,  did you hear that?  It happened to Israel  the other day.  It was by Terrace.  Look out Anthony's window.  I'm not kidding.  Terrace did it.  You got to see this, Bobby.  It freaks us out every day.  Look at this thing.  That's not good.  Yeah, those things...  I got to go.  Those things fall down all the time.  No, honestly,  I'm like,  there's something weird  going on.  So, Caroline's?  Caroline's?  I'm playing Caroline's.  We're almost done.  This is not working. 
[02:25:30]  No, it's not.  It's just your headphones.  Your headphones aren't working.  He's right.  The mic's not working.  Mars, can you fix his mic?  It's not working.  I can't hear nothing.  Yeah.  Are we still on?  Are we on the air?  What's going on?  We haven't been on the air  in 15 minutes.  Oh, we haven't?  No.  You can leave.  You didn't know  what was going on.  We're back live here.  No, no, no.  Dude.  Yeah, I'm kind of mad again now. 
[02:26:00]  It's weird how it came back.  But we sold tickets,  so calm down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we're going to sell more for that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I just need to  ask some questions.  Well, wait.  We got another clip.  Because then you were convinced  that this console  was moving up and down.  Which it was.  You sure?  I'm positive, dude.  You're positive now?  I'm going out of my mind.  Was it or was it not?  Please tell me.  Was it or was it not?  That this table moves up and down.  Was it or was it not?  I think it was, man.  All right, here's the clip  from yesterday. 
[02:26:30]  I gotta get out of here, man.  Where you going?  What's wrong?  Something weird is happening.  I think I'm tired or something.  What?  What are you talking about?  Tired?  I didn't sleep well last night.  I had like two hours of sleep.  And I'm literally like,  my whole thing is like.  What, your EQ?  Did this thing move?  What are you talking about?  Are you all right, dude?  Are you flipping out?  No, I'm flipping out.  Are you flipping out?  I can't get out of here.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, I'm losing my mind, man.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  I'm sweating, man.  You are sweating.  There is something going on here.  The 20,000 pounds are on a console.  First of all, I just want to say. 
[02:27:00]  We're probably off the air.  That's fine.  No, we're on the air.  We're on the air?  Yeah, we told you that.  First of all, let me just say this.  The mic is not working.  I can't hear myself.  We can hear you.  And then, I just, my whole like, level of.  Like, I feel like something's shaking or something's going on.  No, something did shake in the studio.  But that was a while ago.  I have to piss.  Is everything cool?  Yeah.  Do they have headphones?  I feel like I'm.  I just saw it.  You don't know what you're freaking me out.  Bobby. 
[02:27:30]  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby Lee's leaving the studio.  Bobby, relax.  Is the cable moving?  No.  Is the cable moving?  This is a half ton.  How can we move this fucking thing?  Hey, dude, just sit down.  Relax.  You're freaking me out.  You're freaking me out.  We're back live?  Yeah.  So that's, you convinced that this console was moving.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  Is that, um, what it is, is that either A, I'm just going crazy.  Yeah.  Or B, there's some deception going on.  Right. 
[02:28:00]  And I can't, you're doing it now.  You are doing it now.  And I'm not crazy.  I slept for like eight hours last night.  So this thing moves.  Yes.  Okay.  Well, that's funny, people.  That's really funny.  Yeah.  I didn't sleep last night.  Yeah.  As Bobby Lee's trying to explain, you know, this whole thing, it moves this console up.  Yes.  Um, all right, so this was moving and it was deception.  So, all right.  And maybe we should have told you yesterday so you could have gotten a good night's sleep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a wonder for 24 hours.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  And wait, Travis, Danny just came in and said, Travis, I thought Bob was almost wrecking  the bed.  How, Travis?  I don't remember that.  Well, he explained it to me in my headphones.  He said that at one point, uh, Bob Kelly had taken the cap off of a permanent marker and  it made a sound with it.  And he went, dude, what's that?  What's that sound?  Oh.  Do you smell something?  What is that?  Oh, God.  And then apparently you just gave him a look like, too.  What are you doing?  You fucking asshole.  That's the look.  Bob's got some great improv skills.  Bobby's having a panic attack.  That's six.  Fucking moron.  Who did that once?  Your stepfather before he knocked you in the fucking teeth? 
[02:29:00]  Fucking asshole.  Bob was here so I could spit on him.  Damn it, what's that?  A fat idiot with a marker.  We, uh, there's two more clips I want to play.  Then, um, all of a sudden everyone started leaving the building and that really freaked  out Bobby.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  All right.  That's it.  This is, this is moving now.  I just saw it.  I, listen.  Oh my God, he's listening.  It's mine.  That's messed up because, listen.  How could this thing move?  Look how big this thing is, Bobby.  It's either that or I'm going crazy, dude. 
[02:29:30]  And I need to go and take a nap.  What are you seeing, really?  Seriously.  I'm seeing either the, the, the floor is moving up.  Right.  Or this is moving.  Or I'm like, literally like, I'm, you know, like I thought he was wrong in New York or  something.  You see how big this table is and all this equipment?  How is all this going to move?  Seriously.  Why is everybody leaving the building?  See?  Why is all these, the office is empty now.  All right, dude.  I got to get out of here, dude.  Are you serious?  Are they all in front of the, uh, go on?  Honestly, thank you so much for having me on.  Where are you going?  Bobby.  No, I got to get out of here, man. 
[02:30:00]  For what?  No, there's something, there's something going on here.  Like.  Oh, what, where are they?  No, no, no, no.  Dude.  Why is everyone leaving?  See, that's the thing.  Oh, crap.  I got to, I got to leave.  When people leave, I leave.  When people leave, I leave.  Why do you think everyone was leaving?  We're back live here.  No, I think you guys were like, it was like either pre-planned.  I don't know.  You know what, dude?  It's like, I'm kind of like.  We don't pre-plan anything.  So it was just on the, improvised.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some improvisation. 
[02:30:30]  I love that you have that policy, Bobby.  You got a whole system.  When people leave, I leave.  Right.  There's not a lot of rules I live by.  That's one of them.  But.  You know what I mean?  Because it's like, why are, you know, I was like, why is it getting dark?  Why is there a rabbit?  I mean, you know, when those signs.  Yeah.  Come up in my life.  All the TVs went off.  I need to get out of that situation.  And then Bob Kelly's trickery.  Yeah.  Dude, what is that?  You fucking fuck. 
[02:31:00]  What do you know?  My ex-friend.  What a douchebag.  I didn't even know he did that.  Oh, it was fucking embarrassing.  All right.  Why don't you just make the noise of the fucking teasing a kitten?  Do you smell something?  Yeah, shit.  And it's your bitch.  All right.  One more clip and then we're going to move on.  And then, of course, the bunny appeared.  What a weenie.  That's really racist.  Oh.  Oh.  And at this point, Bobby couldn't handle anymore. 
[02:31:30]  He had to get the fuck out of this studio.  This is when the bunny appeared.  Bobby, why are you covering your eyes?  I'm fine.  I'm going to smash it.  Are you okay?  What the fuck is that?  My God.  What's what?  There's a bunny rabbit.  Where?  There's a bunny rabbit.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  I know what this is like.  You guys are putting tricks on me, man.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  How could we be playing tricks on you, Bobby?  Or not that type of broadcast. 
[02:32:00]  What are you talking about?  You smell that?  Do you smell it?  I know the bit.  Where?  There's a bunny rabbit right there.  Where?  Robert, there's a bunny rabbit.  I can't see a fucking bunny rabbit, Bobby.  Are you fucking with me now?  You're fucking with me.  You're fucking with me.  I know what's going on.  I know what's going on now.  And that's good that you did that.  All right.  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Where is there a bunny rabbit?  Show us the bunny rabbit.  Show me the bunny rabbit.  I'm with you.  Yeah, show us.  Show me the bunny rabbit. 
[02:32:30]  Show us.  Out there somewhere?  All right.  I'm leaving.  Where are you going?  I've got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Thanks for having me on the show.  Baby, wait.  All right.  Can I come back tomorrow?  All right.  Bobby.  All right.  There goes Bobby Lee.  And he's looking for the bunny rabbit.  Let's do line of the day.  And that's it?  Okay.  And what Bobby decided was, all right, I got to see if that bunny rabbit is real or not.  So he ran out of the studio to try to find the bunny, and the bunny was gone.  And that's what really freaked you out, because you couldn't find it.  And then you're like, you know what?  I got to get the fuck out of this building. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And then we never told you what was going on.  Yeah.  And we left you hanging for 24 hours.  We were in hysterics after that.  There was no guilt, though?  None.  None.  Yeah, no guilt.  None.  Not even a shred.  Not a shred.  Guilt doesn't reside here.  Yeah.  It's the oddest thing.  There's no guilt in this room.  Yeah.  If you have guilt, you just put it down.  It's like a bag of fucking bricks.  You didn't even feel guilty about saying bunny rabbit that many times in that short of 
[02:33:30]  period?  Do you mean a horse rabbit?  Bunny rabbit?  Look at that.  Yeah.  What are people going to start just saying rabbit?  Yeah.  Or bunny.  Well, we felt like we should tell you something, but you left so quickly.  And then, you know, what I just noticed, though, is I left like nine times.  Yeah.  You didn't know that?  No.  Within the nine times, you could have said, we're kidding.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  Are you mad?  No, I'm not mad.  I'm very happy.  Thank you for having me on the show.  You know, it's very rare that you get, like, you know, because you don't plan those moments.  It's very rare that you have somebody who's just in a very sleep-deprived state who will 
[02:34:00]  believe that there's a six-foot bunny rabbit walking.  That's true.  I just said it.  We have to go with that.  Yeah, we kind of do.  You're right.  Uh-oh.  You're right.  Uh-oh.  Dude.  I'm taking a cap off my pen, folks.  What's that?  Rob's a master of deception.  Dude, what is it, dude?  You know what, dude?  The guy's having a panic.  Shut up.  Do you have a guy in a bunny suit?  I got a camera.  I'm going to steal your soul, dude.  Shut up. 
[02:34:30]  But you know what I did see is not the white bunny, but I saw another guy in a pink bunny  suit getting changed to do his trickery.  You saw this?  Yes.  Wow.  Like, around the corner or something.  I'm like, this is ongoing.  Now, we can be honest with you and tell you that never happened.  We only had one bunny.  We only have one bunny suit.  What does it look like?  All right, cool.  The Shining?  I'm not even kidding.  Was somebody blowing it while Shelly Duvall ran by it?  So, Bobby Lee came back today. 
[02:35:00]  The video's up on YouTube.  Bobby Lee, what does it say?  Bobby Lee has a panic attack on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what it's labeled as far as the YouTube version goes.  It makes me look like a crazy person, guys.  People are saying that a little.  People are loving the video.  And you're going to be at Caroline's tonight and tomorrow night?  He's looking at it.  Yes, please.  212-757-4100.  The very funny Bobby Lee.  Yeah, until Sunday.  Come watch Bobby have a panic attack at Caroline's.  No, no, no.  I'm fine.  Everybody should wear rabbit ears.  Little bunny tails, rabbit ears. 
[02:35:30]  You are.  What was Birbiglia doing in there at one point?  He was like wrestling you away from the door or something?  Yeah, he started blocking me.  Yeah.  Like, what are you going to do?  I can go through you.  I've got physical.  Birbiglia is a psychopath.  He had a real problem with Bobby because Bobby came in and we haven't seen each other.  He hugged Robert.  He hugged me.  And then he gave Mike a handshake.  And Mike didn't want to.  But Mike was almost in hug mode.  Like, ah, it's hug time.  Yeah.  And Mike was just very aggressive with Bobby the whole time. 
[02:36:00]  It was funny to see that uglier side of Mike, which I like.  Yeah, we love the other side of Mike.  Yeah, he got up.  Mike got up and after seeing him hug two people, got up to give him the hug.  And you saw his arm go out.  Yeah.  And then Bobby just like, did he just like shake his hand?  No, because the reason is because, A, I'm like, after I hugged Jim, I'm like, you know  what?  If I hug more people, then I have to do everybody.  Right.  So I just ended it with Mike.  Well, the reason Mike was mad at you is because he's normally the guy with the stubbiest 
[02:36:30]  limbs in a room.  But he didn't know.  He hates you and Todd Lynn.  Because you and Vern Troyer are on his shit list.  Well, yeah, he was fucking not happy at all.  Mike was not a fucking pleased individual.  Mike's got some fucking issues, man.  Yeah, he does.  He wasn't fucking having it yesterday.  Deep-seated.  Folded his little arms.  Guys. 
[02:37:00]  Guys.  We got a hater on Instant Feedback.  All right.  He's like, why don't you guys just replay yesterday's show?  All right.  Why don't you guys just replay yesterday's show?  Thank you, Kenny.  We're getting Bobby Lee's reaction now, you dope.  It's a completely different show than yesterday.  Even though we're playing something from yesterday.  Thanks, Kenny.  I got an idea.  Thanks, buddy.  I got an idea.  Yes?  We got a lot of haters out there, right? 
[02:37:30]  They're just hating all the time.  I want the hater fighters to label these fuckers with bloody tampons.  What?  How do you do that?  On message boards and stuff.  Label the true haters with bloody tampons, and then they'll get the hint to go away.  What, on their names?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Or just start posting bloody tampons right after one of these dumb hating posts.  Oh, I got ya.  Quoted for tampons.  Quoted for tampons.  Yeah.  Time to get rid of the stupid haters. 
[02:38:00]  You've been put tampon doom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have to acknowledge, by the way, we have a great studio audience.  I think we should bring them in.  I think, perhaps like other Fridays, we should bring them here into the studio.  That might freak out Bobby Lee, though.  No.  Bobby's fine.  I'm not a crazy dude.  I know what people are.  It's fine.  Bobby fucking lives in front of an audience.  Well, Bobby, are you going to be all right with, like, people close to you?  Yeah, because I've got to go anywhere.  You're not going anywhere.  No, because I came here to apologize. 
[02:38:30]  I've got to do another thing.  What thing?  What thing?  I don't know.  Greg has it all set up.  Let's find out from Greg.  Let's ask Greg.  Very handsome, very tan Greg Charles.  This woman came to see you, Miss Tits McGillicuddy.  Holy shit.  Did you call her Tits McGillicuddy?  Tits McGillicuddy.  Tits McGillicuddy.  Those are lovely.  She's fighting Tits McGillicuddy.  She'll rip you apart, Rock.  That's right.  Bobby, you're...  The Locker in the Marl Rock.  Got a Batman voice.  Bobby, we're selling tickets for you, so you stay right here. 
[02:39:00]  Where does he have to go, Greg?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  Am I on?  Yes.  You have a little while, right?  You have a few minutes.  You have a few minutes.  I'm just saying that.  I can't stay here.  Where do you have them booked?  We've got to go down to Hot 97 again, Oak.  All right.  No, I'm kidding.  We're not going to Hot 97.  Where you going?  He's going to take a little nap, and then we have to go to another satellite radio station.  You can say it.  It's serious.  Oh, serious.  Oh, that's right.  We can say it.  Yeah, we're all one big happy family.  It's one big happy family.  Did we merge yet or no? 
[02:39:30]  No.  Yes, the merger went through, but one more thing with the no has to yes with the thing.  It hasn't gone through yet, though.  Almost.  I have no idea.  Almost.  All right.  We got Bobby.  We're going to start today's festivities.  I got in front of me a water bug.  Do we have roaches here?  It's fucking annoying.  We, yeah.  I don't want it near me.  This fucking place is disgusting.  The food.  If you go around that side there and make the left where the refrigerator is, they scurry. 
[02:40:00]  They scurry like the fucking pieces of shit they are.  And I mean the interns.  And then the cockroaches are even worse.  What do you want roaches to do?  Hang out and wait for a fucking, no one's going to go.  A shoe.  A shoe.  Wait for a big shoe.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a big one, too.  The first of many.  Holy fuck.  Get that out of here.  What are you, crazy?  Dude, it's in the machine now.  What the fuck?  Are you nuts?  I don't want the roach on me. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  I'm done.  Get my truck.  I'm out of here.  Dude, why didn't you fucking...  Dude, are you crazy?  You're crazy.  You're not going to find it now.  It's crazy.  Well, step on it.  You guys are fucking talking to it.  Kill the fucking thing.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  God almighty.  We're all reacting like Steve C. looking at a pussy.  Jesus.  All right, listen.  Do you got it? 
[02:41:00]  You got it because I want to fuck it.  Those are fucking disgusting.  You better have smashed that thing.  Smash it.  Smash it.  Smash it.  Kill it.  No, keep it away from Poe because he's afraid of them.  Poe hates him.  Kill it.  Damn, he's a ball.  Wow, nice move, Dan.  Show him to Poe.  I want to see Poe freak out.  Where's Poe?  Poe, come here.  Poe!  Hey, Dan, how about you show him away from my chair?  By my fucking food prep area here. 
[02:41:30]  I have a sandwich.  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  Why, he's a brooch?  No, no, no.  That's right.  No, no.  Keep him away.  No, no.  Keep him away.  Poe really is scared of cockroaches?  No, no.  Keep him away.  Well, he is Puerto Rican.  I know.  Then I'm like fucking, I'm sure he's trying to name it already.  Yeah.  All right, Poe, get over there.  Come on, Poe.  You're a fucking martial artist.  Dude, that's a big.  Did you just give him breathing holes?  That's very courteous, Dan.  There's enough air in that cup for a year for that fucking little thing.  Fucking Ray doesn't kill them.  You're already going to pass out.  Why don't you bring it some milk? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  They eat shit, Dan.  Give it a little treat.  This is the first of many that are going to be caught.  But let Poe take a look at the cockroach.  Why do you want me to look at him?  He's underneath the cup.  He's safe.  He's going to run.  We want to see who would win, Master Poe or a cockroach.  He won.  He's down.  All right.  Reveal the cockroach.  No, I'm going to kill it, though.  All right.  Then you kill it.  Let's see.  Wait.  Reveal it, though. 
[02:42:30]  Fight it, Poe.  Fight it.  Fight the cockroach.  You want me to fight the cockroach?  Wait.  Give the cockroach a running start.  It was on his back when we recaptured it.  Wait.  Poe, you have to take the thing off.  Hold on.  No.  No.  Danny will take it off to make sure it starts running.  I want to give this thing a chance.  Where's he going to run away from him?  No, it's not.  I'm going to kill it.  I'm going to kill it.  No, it's just not.  What are we doing?  Bobby.  He's going to kill it.  Give me a stick.  Get me my stick.  Where's my stick?  Are you ready?  Where's my stick?  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Give me my stick.  My stick.  I need my stick.  Danny, is it going to run when you lift it up?  Dude, I can kill it. 
[02:43:00]  It wants to leave that cup immediately.  Okay.  Here we go.  Without the broom.  Here we go.  Wait.  Hold on.  Poe versus the cockroach.  Hold on.  I have to get my weapon.  You don't need a weapon?  What are you going to run?  Oh, you got to get near it.  He's going to run.  All right.  Here we go.  Danny's going to...  One, two, three.  Oh, damn.  Fucking damn.  You've been pulled.  Wow.  You used every muscle in your leg to do that.  Puerto Rican accuracy. 
[02:43:30]  I love how you strutted around like you just kicked the shit out of something with a trillion  to your side.  You think that was fucking Randy Couture on the floor?  You went down, bitch.  That's right.  I'm not even looking at his eyes anymore.  You can't be more dead than that cockroach just right now.  Not at all.  That was a direct hit.  So...  Oh, boy.  Well, we've been talking about the cockroaches.  See, Bobby, we told you cockroaches in the drop ceiling yesterday.  You thought we were bullshitting, but that's the one thing that is true.  There are a lot of cockroaches in this building now. 
[02:44:00]  And he was fast.  Or in this area.  Well, this is what we want to do.  We want to do cockroach wars with the interns.  Cockroach wars?  Yeah, we want them to set up traps this weekend and see who could, you know...  Oh, like a hunt.  Yeah, see who could...  We want cockroach hunting.  See who could capture the most cockroaches between now and Monday.  Cream Pie Jones said he would eat a cockroach.  Well, there it is on the floor.  Right there.  Lick it up, motherfucker.  No, don't...  Dude, that's not good.  Cream Pie.  That's like cream. 
[02:44:30]  It's sanitary, right?  That's a fucking roach.  Roach.  Fucking roach.  Oh, don't do it, dude.  Don't do it.  Cream Pie, get on all four.  Get out of the way, Sam.  Get out of the way, Sam.  I want the audience.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  You've got to be kidding me.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  All right.  He has picked up the cockroach.  He's showing it around.  You've got to be kidding.  And...  Boo. 
[02:45:00]  He's opening his mouth.  He's teasing the audience.  Shit.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn.  Shit.  Oh, fuck.  He ate a cockroach smooth on the floor.  Post-dry heaving.  Dude, you are worse than Asians.  Oh, man.  He ate something that touched a Puerto Rican.  Post-dry heaving over here. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Very, very good.  Cream Pie Jones.  Yes.  That was really unbelievable.  Don't even speak to me again.  So we're going to do Cockroach Wars.  That was a hell of a closer.  Are people working on their trapping devices?  What do we got so far?  I don't like Cockroach Wars.  It sounds like you want fighting cockroaches.  All right.  What do you want to call it?  Like some kind of hunt thing.  Cockroach hunt?  Cockroach hunt.  Okay.  Whackaroach.  So far, Cream Pie Jones and Hip Hop Ron have both gotten strongly behind this thing, and 
[02:46:00]  they're both competing with each other.  Oh, really?  I feel like you guys have moved past the dude eating a fucking giant cockroach pretty quick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, so now what do we do now?  You know what?  We are so desensitized at this point.  We talk about it from time to time.  My stomach is so fucking dry.  That's why we like guys in here that aren't as desensitized.  We've seen it all at this point.  He wore...  Cream Pie Jones actually wore a shit hat.  Yeah.  I took a dump at CBS. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It was a fucking pile of nastiness, and he fucking put his hands in the toilet, and  he put his...  It was called a doody hat.  He made a doody hat.  He made a doody hat.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Big boy made a doody.  This was on two separate occasions, though.  There was one occasion of the doody hat, and then there was another occasion of him  just lifting up what looked like a pulled pork sandwich out of the toilet bowl, and  then waved goodbye to it and put it back and flushed it away.  And he had to say, bye-bye, doody.  We got to show him that video.  We had it, right? 
[02:47:00]  Big boy makes a doody.  We were extremely disappointed that this didn't take the internet by storm, by the way, Greg.  Yeah, how could it not?  I think we had 112 people view this video.  There's a guy wearing a shit hat, and that didn't get any views.  Right.  What do you got to do to get anybody's attention?  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  I want to talk about the cockroaches as he finds that video.  Now, how many cockroaches have we really seen?  Whoa.  Oh, so fucking many back there.  Have you seen them, man?  Yes.  I'm hearing just rumors.  I haven't seen them.  There have been sightings.  Like, people who have come here and have seen them right, like, where the new studio comes 
[02:47:30]  in, right where the audience is.  There's at least two seen there.  When they were cleaning the back sink, like, the first clean that happened at the beginning  of the week, they found six in one shot.  Like, six just started running around.  Do we know where they might be hiding?  In the back sink?  The back sink?  Yeah, there's two fridges.  There's the front fridge, and then the rear fridge, and the Rana Fez office.  The front fridge, if anybody has anything in there, just forget about it.  Don't put anything in that fridge. 
[02:48:00]  I've opened that fridge and seen roaches running inside of the fridge.  They creep up on you.  How the fuck did they get in there?  I don't know, but the roaches live in the ice in that fridge.  Like, the ice maker has ice and roaches in it, and the roaches are moving around.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  I don't know if they're there now, but...  Someone go look.  I really want to find, like, because they say if you see a couple, that means there's  hundreds, possibly thousands.  That means there's a million.  We found at least...  All right, where are they then?  There's got to be a place where they're really hiding.  They're hiding the walls.  We found at least a dozen here this week. 
[02:48:30]  This week alone?  Yeah.  And how are we going to capture these things?  Get some glue traps.  Okay.  Glue traps.  Glue traps for roaches?  Yeah, yeah.  That'll work.  Absolutely.  Restaurants do that.  You lay them out because when it gets dark, they come running around, you know, trying  to find food.  And then they go, whoa!  And they get stuck.  Yeah, because we've got to have proof.  Yeah.  Jim, how can you eat after that?  I could eat nothing I can't eat through.  How about we get...  How about we all...  How about this? 
[02:49:00]  We all get a glue trap.  It's like...  It's just a piece of paper with really heavy glue on it.  Uh-huh.  And we all write our names on each one.  And then we see which one gets the most cockroaches between now and Monday.  Who gets best placement, though.  Yeah.  Everybody picks their own place.  Yeah, but everyone's going to pick by the fridge.  No, it's not by the fridge.  I went under the fridge.  I got under the fridge.  I get the spot in your ear rock's mouth.  I say bait.  Everybody has to choose their own bait style.  There's a shitting rhinoceros caught in yours. 
[02:49:30]  They're not going to get away from a glue trap, I'm telling you.  At least we'll have...  Poor ear rock.  Any chance to rag on ear rock?  Let's get some...  Oh, fuck.  So why don't we get those glue things and we'll start there.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Jimmy.  I love it.  Did they check behind the refrigerator?  I don't know.  That's a good idea.  We're going to do that right now.  If you pull that fridge out, it's just going to look like...  All right, Sam, why don't you do that?  Get a mic, though.  Mr. Pratt's apartment from fucking...  Hip-hop, is that on?  Creepshow.  Yeah, it's done.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  Fucking Creepshow.  All right, they're going to the back fridge.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue? 
[02:50:30]  Oh, there it is.  They found one?  Yeah, Creepi found one.  Oh, look at this.  Wait.  Shit.  Check out the new ice maker.  Yeah, Pat, the ice maker.  I just checked the ice maker.  All right, they're checking around the...  Here.  What?  Whoa.  Yeah.  That's why I love the show.  Full volume, thank you.  What roach is in there?  Oh, shit.  Fucking stand. 
[02:51:00]  Mr. Pratt.  Mr. Pratt.  Sam, what do we got?  Pat's off, he's got one.  Pat's picking him up with his hands.  How many?  No.  There's like seven.  There's one baby.  There's like seven?  Seven?  They're all over.  It's infested.  I swear to God, it is infested.  We just moved a file cabinet.  They found one.  Then they moved a garbage can.  They started yelling because there was three behind a garbage can.  They're all over.  When you have that many roaches with this much daylight activity, you have a fucking problem. 
[02:51:30]  This place is fucking infested.  Tuffy has two baby ones.  Two babies.  Good, Tuffy.  Just smashing the place apart.  I love that one minute you're deconstructing those subtleties of the legal system, and the  next minute there's people licking the back of the fridge for roaches.  Yes, a multifaceted program we have here.  What?  There's two little ones right here.  You got two little ones?  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  What do you tend to do to them?  I could snort them.  What are they, babies?  Yeah, they're little guys.  Would you do that?  Sure.  Wait, now Cream Pie's coming in with more.  Oh, Cream Pie's stealing my thunder again.  What do you got, Cream Pie?  Just one.  Just one?  One little guy?  He ate one.  He did eat one.  Fucking things disgust me.  I think we're about to take out the microwave that's over there to see what's behind it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's going to be an ugly scene.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Move the microwave. 
[02:52:30]  This is so bad.  I would love to see this place at night.  All right.  So fucking...  Paul is moving the microwave with a broomstick.  Somebody grab the microwave.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  Fuck it up.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  All right.  He's willing to snort the roaches, huh?  You guys are defensive, huh?  Jesus, what happened?  How's a real man with this broom? 
[02:53:00]  Nothing.  Well, they're scared now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  More people over there.  That will get them out.  There's nothing behind the microwave, but right on top of the microwave is all old condiments  that have been there.  So that's what's being checked out right now.  Who puts food in there?  Oh.  What?  Who puts food in there?  I don't know.  Who put it in there?  Who eats it?  Who would store that food?  Who the fuck would put it?  Who would put it in the shit box?  Jonathan Schwartz.  Oh, really?  Frank's place.  Yeah.  Frank's place. 
[02:53:30]  Fucking go out for lunch.  What do you guys make, eight grand a year?  There's chiselers.  There's two more dead ones.  Found two more?  There's two more.  Did you guys check under the sink?  Because I know that I went in there for paper towels the other day and a bunch ran out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Go under the sink.  There's nothing under the sink right now.  There's nothing under the sink right now.  I left my cookies there, too, a couple days ago.  Oh, forget about those.  I'm kidding.  Let's see.  Oh, just say you took it.  They cleaned under the sink the other day.  That's where they found six in one shot.  Who's cleaning?  The interns.  Did any of them get in my bowl of oatmeal? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  So we're going to do cockroach hunting, all right?  Get those glue things.  We'll give it the weekend so they can kind of re-accumulate.  Yeah.  They'll fuck have kids.  The kids will fuck have kids.  We throw that glue shit down now.  Just the Puerto Ricans.  And we'll capture a lot.  Let's say hi to Mike in Michigan.  Mike?  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, Mike.  Hey.  If you open the microwave up or back of your televisions up, you'll find even more. 
[02:54:30]  They like the electronics.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  Let's go to Andy in Indiana.  Andy?  Yeah, I just wanted to warn you guys.  If you're stomping on those roaches, that's what releases the eggs.  It's going to cause a bigger infestation.  Shut up.  These guys.  Not if we get interns to eat it. 
[02:55:00]  They like it.  Like, there are some.  Let's say hi to Darwin in Newark.  I just think it's funny, by the way, that we would actually have a glue trap by E-Rock's  mouth, but a shitting rhinoceros is such a big animal.  Yes.  To stick in a glue trap.  And then to discover it.  That would have to be the weakest shitting rhinoceros.  Oh, yeah.  Can't get out of that glue trap. 
[02:55:30]  What's up, Darwin?  Yo, you guys are smart as hell.  X-Men cannot afford to get an exterminator, so he got you guys to manipulate a way to get  these guys to do the job for them.  Very nice.  Cool.  Manful phone call.  Yeah, well, X-Men hasn't really done any upkeep lately.  No, they don't have enough money for much of anything.  To the point where we're infested with cockroaches.  Yes, Sam?  I think I might know one of the reasons that cockroaches is there.  Behind that file cabinet where we just found a bunch, we also found an old bottle of E-Rock's  Hawaiian Punch. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, E-Rock.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup here.  E-Rock.  I think we got everyone freaked out.  We're going to bring the audience in, too, right?  Yeah, we'll do that during the break.  We should bring you guys in, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  They want to come in.  Bobby Lee playing Carolines tonight, tomorrow, Sunday.  212-757-4100.  4100-4100, Greg Giraldo.  Greg, you promoting anything? 
[02:56:30]  Nope.  Just the big traveling virus show next Saturday.  Next Saturday.  It's going to be a good time.  Tickets still available for the PNC show.  All right.  We'll continue.  Ladies and gentlemen, Green Pie Jones.  Green Pie Jones.  What do you want me to do?  They wanted me to make cumzies.  Cumzies.  Green Pie.  She's squeezing his honey.  Green Pie.  Touching his penis.  Green Pie.  That's a full erection.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Green Pie.  She's stuck in my titties.  Green Pie.  I'm such a whore.  Green Pie. 
[02:57:00]  I'm just jerking off on a tits.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, shit.  I think he made the cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  Green Pie.  Green Pie.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  10,000 miles for a life.  All right, listen.  First of all, we brought the audience inside. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  Second of all, Bobby Lee has finally had it.  He just left.  He's done with us.  The whole cockroach thing started freaking him out, too.  So go see Bobby.  We love Bobby Lee.  He's going to be great for this radio show in the coming months.  He's at Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  And before we show Greg Girald, though, the shit-hat video from the shit-hat video series,  you've got to retell that story on the air, Greg. 
[02:58:00]  Because there's a bunch of plane mishaps happening today, right?  Yeah.  The time when you ordered the one beverage, they brought you the other one.  Yeah, they brought me the two beverages.  They brought me, I asked for pretzels.  They brought me peanuts.  I was on a little American Airlines, I guess I shouldn't even say the airline.  Yes, you should.  Fuck them.  I can't say the name, but it rhymes with Shamerican Airlines.  That's Shamerican.  Yeah, it was like a little commuter jet thing, and an engine blew the whole thing filled 
[02:58:30]  with smoke.  You know, like when the stewardess is just like, um, um.  What's it sound like when the engine blows?  It was just like a metallic sound.  It was like a bear.  Oh, I thought you wanted to be in an engineer hat.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  So what's it sound like?  It was like a metallic sound.  It was like a ball bearing or something.  It was rattling around, and it just dropped really fast.  The whole thing's turned on its side. 
[02:59:00]  And, oh, there's a guy in the back.  There's a guy in the back going, oh, oh, my God.  Oh.  And then when the plane stabilized, he's like, oh, shit.  I was the dick.  Sorry I lost it here.  You were the biggest pussy in the world.  Look, I got a real hot chick at home and stuff.  It was an older guy.  Like, not the kind of guy you would picture squealing like a little bitch.  Like, how you feeling, lady?  You okay?  Hey.  Did you wet your skirt?  But then we had to emergency land.  They didn't fucking apologize.  They didn't do anything. 
[02:59:30]  The woman says, where's your boarding pass?  And we'll reschedule it.  We'll seat you on another flight.  I said, I don't have my boarding pass.  She goes, how could you not have your boarding pass?  I don't know, because you fucking almost killed me on the way in.  And I thought, you know, maybe I should get off the plane as quick as possible.  Yeah, when the cockpit's full of smoke.  Yeah, six hours.  Like I sat in the airport for close to six hours.  No meal credits.  No nothing.  Wonderful.  When you wrote them a letter, you should have wrote.  Because Continental one time, they fucked me so bad.  I went nuts.  I brutalized them on the air. 
[03:00:00]  And I fucking sent a CD of that brutalizing.  And they took a long time to get back to me.  And my girlfriend at the time said, well, I guess that means the whole company's on the case.  You know, she was just kind of.  And she did eventually leave me.  Over that.  Because you were such a crybaby about your air travel.  Yeah, a little faggot.  Just couldn't handle the inconvenience of being pushed out of first class.  I don't mean it's bad to sit with the fucking scumbags in the back. 
[03:00:30]  No, we just did.  They fucked us.  So anyway, I wrote the letters.  And they took so long to get back to me.  They finally got back to me.  They changed company policy.  We had pilots calling in.  They were so apologetic.  They gave me like fucking $1,200 worth of travel vouchers.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And they're like, we took so long.  Because we were going over everything that happened.  And we changed the policy.  You'll be happy to know.  And for that, I only got a t-shirt.  Nice.  You know.  Yeah.  Something to sleep in.  A little something to sleep in.  Greg, was all hell breaking loose?  People were freaking out.  Like screaming and yelling?  The guy was screaming. 
[03:01:00]  I asked this girl if she wanted to make out with me.  Thinking it would lighten the mood.  But it didn't.  She was fucking horrified.  Even with imminent death, she still wasn't willing.  Because that's like the gag if the plane crashes.  Yeah.  You go to the girl.  You're going to go to the nearest fucking chick and just fucking rip her clothes off.  All of a sudden, the plane levels out and you're fucking on rape charges.  Wonderful.  Nice flight.  Fuck.  The old I-thought-we-were-crashing defense.  Come on.  You did mount her chair and fuck her face through her oxygen mask. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  I do that all the time on every flight.  Yeah.  If I get busted, I always say I thought it was going down.  We were crashing, John.  We hit a little turbulence.  Did you think you were going to die?  Yeah.  I really did.  I was telling you guys, it doesn't reflect well on how I feel about life.  But I was like, all right, fuck it.  Who cares?  I literally wasn't even that worried.  I really wasn't even worried.  Let's see what this is like.  Yeah.  I just didn't want it to be painful.  I didn't want to burn. 
[03:02:00]  And the other thing I was worried was that because the whole fucking plane filled with  fumes and the air things didn't drop.  And I thought, I don't want to die for something completely stupid.  Like die and then have the plane and have them realize, oh, fuck, we forgot to push this.  And then they just land.  And they land and there's corpses in the back.  Asphyxiated corpses.  You were processing a lot of real thoughts.  I would have just been like, ah, ah, ah.  At the beginning.  Not even, what do you need to, ah, ah.  That's this primal fear coming out of you.  I would have just shit my, shit, I would have shit my pants and then tried to bury it. 
[03:02:30]  Still self-conscious even at that point.  I'll lose every bit of evolution we've gone through in thousands of years.  I'll start scratching under my arms, fucking smelling my lawnmower cutting balls.  You ever get fucking onion bags from cutting the lawn?  Of course you have.  And the pilot, the pilot, even the pilot couldn't bluff his way through.  You know, he gets on and he's like, um, this is normal.  We, ah, we do this.  You know, we train pretty much. 
[03:03:00]  So, ah, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  That's why they, ah, yeah.  They talk about the engines and how, hey, his plane is totally capable of flying on that  one engine, that one single thing between life and death that is now humming at twice  the RPM it should be.  Yeah.  We're perfectly comfortable hanging on to life by a thread.  We're built to run on one engine.  If the other engine just quietly peters out and goes, zzzz, by an explosion that removes  a piece of the wing, well, it's a fucking crapshoot. 
[03:03:30]  Good luck, folks.  That sounds pretty scary, though.  It was.  It was pretty, ah, it was pretty traumatizing.  Did you try to tell that story?  I mean, people try to tell you their plane stories and none of them matched up.  They're always bad.  One time we dropped like 80 feet.  I was like, phew.  Yeah.  One time I was delayed for two hours because of rain in Chicago.  Oh, fuck.  Good topper, douche.  Let's, ah, play the duty hat for Greg Giraldi.  Did you guys see it?  Earlier.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Nothing.  Oh, you're welcome.  I'm sure I'm going to show you some shit on someone's head. 
[03:04:00]  Anything for you, people.  Is that it?  I can't see.  Duty hat.  Where's the duty hat?  I don't know.  I'm scared.  Oh, here comes Danny to save the day.  Danny, where's the duty hat?  Yeah, this is, ah, we were hoping this was going to, hold on, let me get the audio off.  All right, that looks like some duty.  Oh, there's someone's duty.  Oh, Christ.  That was your, that was your mess?  Of course it was.  Yeah.  Big boy makes a duty.  Hey, Jimmy, what happened in there?  Big boy made a duty. 
[03:04:30]  Someone say, big boy made a duty?  Oh, my God.  Wearing a duty hat, yes.  This is Creepy Jones that just ate the cockroach.  Oh, this is where he just picks it up, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got a few of them.  Ah!  Big boy sure did make a duty.  Oh.  Oh, God damn it.  What the fuck is wrong with this kid?  I know.  I'm going to wave goodbye.  Waving goodbye with his shitty hand.  I really am going to throw up.  Yeah.  That is so fucking bad.  You had to put a little duty hat on the duty and then flush it down the toilet. 
[03:05:00]  Holy Christ.  Would you go burn your hand somewhere, please?  Wait, when did he wear the shit hat?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  Where's the shit hat, Dan?  You can't watch the sequel until you've seen the original.  Yeah, that's one and two.  I forgot, sorry.  You don't do that.  That's true.  This is The Empire Strikes Back.  The duty hat.  I like to think of it as Back to the Future one and two.  You wouldn't be able to watch two.  Well, let's...  No, you mean because they're all shit.  Hey!  Let's explain it.  Why would a show be dedicated to it on Saturday then? 
[03:05:30]  We thought we were on to something, so we needed to make another one.  Definitely we wanted to keep the series going here.  Oh, my God.  You guys ready?  Yeah.  Not really.  Look at that big piece of shit by the door.  Is he going to put that thing on his head?  Erick?  I'm much thinner, Erick.  No.  Oh, my God.  I really have never seen such a thing anywhere before.  We get bored.  Yeah, boys, that's so wonderful. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, yeah, Greg.  Is the opening to the hat facing up or is the top of that?  Oh, the opening.  Oh, yeah.  Don't keep the door open, you fucking sicko.  I'm just going to fill it.  Fill that hat up.  It looks like someone took the tail of a man's hat.  I laid the duty in the bowl.  Fuck.  What is that?  I did it right into a hat.  I took it off into a baseball cap.  The water looks like a scared octopus was swimming in it. 
[03:06:30]  That's a sturdy log.  Oh, boy.  You got a duty hat.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  And he's taking the hat out of the toilet with the duty in it.  Of course, carefully trip the water off at the point of the water.  Yeah, you don't want to get your head wet.  And then, uh, and then Creep Pie Jones. 
[03:07:00]  We really thought these videos would take off, Greg Geraldo.  They just never did.  Little duty fell out.  This must have gotten a shitload of views, no?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Oh, fuck.  You didn't put the hat squarely on his hat.  You didn't put the hat on.  I'm not fucking accepting that.  Why?  You got to put that hat on and pull the ring down. 
[03:07:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I really am sick.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  There's your ending. 
[03:08:00]  Squashing the hat further down on his head.  Smearing the duty all over Creep Pie Jones' head.  Oh, man.  How can you do that and not you?  Oh, my God.  That's got a duty head.  That's got a duty head.  There's less than a hat.  How's that?  I don't know.  We can fail.  Mind control.  I know.  Steve had crickets in his room when he was editing this.  I'd like crickets.  I was doing some improv, and that sound just happened. 
[03:08:30]  Creep Pie, are you German?  Are you German?  No.  No, they usually like the shit videos, the Germans.  Yeah, they do.  It's always angry, too.  Conquered nations.  Never two smiling people.  There's one series of shit videos where there's always a guy shitting in a girl's mouth,  and this guy gets the fucking Carvelius logs.  Wow.  They're awful. 
[03:09:00]  Talent.  Carvelius.  They just kind of spiral up.  Carvelius.  They look like the Mr. Frosty.  That's quite an adjective.  You know, Mr. Frosty.  You don't remember, you ever see Mr. The Ice Cream Dude, Mr. Frosty, whatever?  Mr. Softy.  He has an ice cream skull.  Like, you know how that's what it looks like?  Yeah.  Put a head made of ice cream.  That is fucking foul.  What happened?  Mr. Frosty.  Well, you know, Sam had a good suggestion.  He said that maybe I should try and find the time that Pat Duffy brushed his teeth with 
[03:09:30]  dog shit.  Ah.  Ah!  Jesus.  So, like a normal person, on Foundry, I go to use the search function, and I type in,  what do you think I typed in as a search screen?  I would put Pat Duffy dog shit toothbrush or something.  Well, I had more faith in that.  I just put dog shit.  Oh, okay.  Because that's going to yield a result.  Right.  Wow.  Well, let me read you some of the things that came up before Pat Duffy's dog shit video.  Oh, website.  Reality show competition.  My resume. 
[03:10:00]  Redneck picks a fight.  Lisa Sparks and her big booty.  Joan Rivers curses.  Busty Janna.  Roland gets tickled.  What?  How is that dog shit?  Chubby blonde girl.  Oh, here we go.  This one's kind of relevant.  Chubby blonde girl steps in dog crap.  Here's one that's really relevant.  Skid Row music video.  What?  Baby diaper mustache.  Now at least we're getting to actual shit.  18-year-old Vicky. 
[03:10:30]  Hot French chick.  Rich Voss.  There's another one that's quite relevant.  Here we go.  Oh, here it is.  Five rows down.  Opie.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Wait.  That's not even it.  That's Opie.  That's when you froze it with that shit.  I'm sorry.  I thought I actually found a video.  I didn't.  I ruined things.  God.  Where is it?  Dog shit Pat Duffy try.  I'm still looking.  Try putting Pat Duffy in there.  I don't see it whatsoever.  Foundry has always been the worst site to navigate.  I've never been able to find one thing on there. 
[03:11:00]  I put dog shit in.  Hot dog.  Where is it?  I would say.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, it's way.  There it is.  Oh, I can't believe I missed that.  The way it works is.  How?  How does it work?  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Duty site.  All right.  You ready?  My resume.  Poor shitting bastard isn't even here to defend himself.  No, he's not.  He's not even here to stand there and scroll. 
[03:11:30]  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Shit down my leg.  Not only am I gay and incompetent, but I'm stupid.  I hope he didn't make it.  I hope he fucking was going for his colonoscopy and he hit a pothole and shit in the car.  Fucking dweeb.  I hope you're listening right now.  Shit down my pants.  Wait, Danny's pissed off again.  What's up, Danny?  Just because our interns are retarded.  I said, go to the store, get me things to catch roaches in.  Oh, no.  All right.  I want bodies. 
[03:12:00]  I don't want bait traps.  I don't want stuff that they're going to bring back to the nest and die in the wall.  I want to have a body count.  So he brings back two of what I want and then three of the fucking syringe things.  Combat syringes full of bait that doesn't kill them on contact.  This is the shit that they go into the wall and die with.  They take it back to their family and feed it to their children.  I don't know, sir, didn't look at the box before making purchases.  I guess he thought it would make really funny radio if you just kind of stood by the wall  and imagined them all dead and they're dying. 
[03:12:30]  I bet they're all back there.  What happened, sir?  I apologize.  What?  Why would your mic work?  God.  It's on.  It's on.  I apologize if I grab the wrong one.  They were right next to the ones with the gel.  If I didn't grab the gel one, I'll go back and return it.  The gel we don't, we can't use either.  Well, because Danny said body count, I figure you put gel on paper.  You know, but they just eat it and go into the wall.  There's actually a nice...  You've got to get them stuck on the paper.  Like, there's even an illustration of the roaches crawling back into the wall on the box. 
[03:13:00]  Like, they figured, they knew some idiot like you was going to go to the store,  so they even put a picture on the box to help you along.  And of all the combat traps that you said not to get,  there's also illustrations of them walking out, so I had choices.  You know what, I like this kid.  I like spider.  I like spider.  You're going to take them?  What's this world coming to?  I can't believe my ears.  Here's what I'm looking for, and I see there's a picture of roaches going in,  but you know what?  I'll be damned if I can't find the picture of the roaches coming out of it.  That's what I want. 
[03:13:30]  I love how it's in Spanish, too.  One side is English, one side is Spanish.  It's only in Spanish.  Can you return those, please, and get me the right thing?  All right, here.  Oh, shit.  You got one roach person.  Danny's a regular prick.  Set this up.  Maybe we could get a few before we get out of here today.  Danny asked for something, and the kid just disregarded him.  Didn't listen to him.  Spitting Danny's face.  Right, pretty much.  All right.  You know what it is, though?  It's just like I remember being an intern.  It wasn't that long ago.  No, no.  Danny obviously takes his job really seriously.  Whenever you toss around terms like body count, when it comes to roaches. 
[03:14:00]  We're looking for maximum body count.  We got one more video to show you, Greg, and then we're going to move on to stuff.  Which one is this?  Pat Duffy.  All right, okay.  Here we go.  People are calling you the Roger Clemens.  Wow.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  This right here is a piece of genuine golden retriever dog shit.  Okay?  Okay.  And this is a toothbrush. 
[03:14:30]  Combine these two, and I will brush my teeth with dog shit.  What the fuck?  Oh, wow.  I was just informed.  Uh-oh.  E-Rock brought his own toothbrush.  Now we all know that there are problems that E-Rock has in his mouth.  The halitosis kid?  Yeah, yeah.  You won't admit, Fezzy, right?  Want to keep it fair above the table that he has really awful breath.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You would think he has two asses. 
[03:15:00]  His breath is hardcore.  Loosen it up.  There goes the golden retriever.  They're not a fun.  Did you practice?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  What are we looking at?  It's Murray's stringing.  Fuck you, Dave.  Bring it.  All right.  No.  Oh, Greg.  Stop.  Yeah, I think you can go and see some breakfast.  Oh, God.  You can see this dog shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Get the ball.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Oh, God.  Dustin's watching this with a cynical eye of Kubrick in the editing room.  I'm thinking of things I could have done differently.  Oh, God.  It's that fucking funny.  What do you think, Red?  Oh, jeez.  Why are you over there, man?  Yes, I'm fuking from here over there.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He's also a restaurant critic. 
[03:16:00]  That's right.  Zagat gave it one log.  All right.  No wonder she broke up with me.  That's pretty fucking...  Yeah, then he kisses his girl at the end of that.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  He's right over there.  Hey, Pat, you got...  I don't know.  You got a stump for everybody today?  Sure.  I wanted to stick those in my nose.  The bugs.  I don't know if you want to do that or not.  You want to snort up the baby cockroaches?  Or I could brush my teeth with those bugs.  I have a toothbrush in my backpack. 
[03:16:30]  I say he snorts up the baby cockroaches.  Yeah, snorting cockroaches would be good.  I like the fact that we're glancing over, brush your teeth with roaches like it's old hats.  Yeah.  Oh, that's how you do dog shit.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to top dog shit.  Hey, snazzy dresser, is your mic working?  Yeah, my mic's on.  Greg, have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup, that video?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I know.  Because I was saying, you know, if you're grossed out by that, I mean, that...  I know.  That was pretty fun.  That fucking video.  That's kind of silly.  Are they still alive in there, the baby cockroaches?  Yeah.  How are you going to snort them?  I don't know. 
[03:17:00]  I was just going to kind of...  Can I kill them first?  So they don't curl in my brain and kill them?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a pussy, sure.  Yeah.  I say kill them first.  I really don't think there's a way to get from your nose to your brain.  Yeah.  Unless they have fucking, uh...  Well...  God damn, I was trying to think of a small brain joke.  Couldn't.  Asshole I am.  Are they dead?  They are now.  All right.  Lay them on the table in front of everybody.  All right.  Hey, how about that table?  Which one?  Yeah, they have the clear one over there in front of the whole crowd.  The whole crowd, see?  Yeah.  Dump out the cockroaches.  Oh, don't knock the roaches.  The audience will prove that this is real. 
[03:17:30]  There you go.  Oh, God.  That's fine.  He's just struggling.  God damn, you will always stand in my way, Sam.  Are you going to use a straw?  Are you going to use a straw or something?  That doesn't help your big fucking head of hair.  You fucking boondocks, comic strip-looking motherfucker.  Jesus.  All right.  Pat Duffy's going to snort baby cockroaches. 
[03:18:00]  He hit hip-hop Ron in the balls.  Yeah, he's just deciding him a ball shot.  Here we go.  Oh, you heard of each one go off.  Oh, man.  I felt that.  All right. 
[03:18:30]  They're in.  Delicious.  Pat's affecting man's men.  You heard of each going.  Yeah.  Like it made the sound.  He keeps punching them in the balls.  All right, then.  Holy shit.  Where are they lodged right now?  I don't know.  I feel too good on my throat.  And then I'm not sure where the other one is.  Oh.  Sinus laying its eggs.  Iraq's having a slight problem in there.  I've just been done.  Iraq, you all right?  What's wrong?  Bring him in.  Bring Iraq in.  Iraq, come in here, young Eric.  We missed you.  Yeah.  Look at how fat he's gotten. 
[03:19:00]  Dude, dude.  Yeah, please.  Let's really look.  Get out, daddy.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I noticed this morning, yeah.  No, I'm not there yet, but I almost threw up on the board.  What's it going to take?  Do we have more bugs?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we want to get Iraq puking today.  I know.  What's on the board?  A mirror?  Wow.  Same joke several times.  You're right.  Sorry.  Iraq, Jimmy noticed that you might have gained a few LBs. 
[03:19:30]  What's going on?  I actually didn't notice.  Why are you getting LBs again?  How much did you put on?  I didn't even notice.  I'm back to 210.  Fine.  What were you down to?  29.  When I, for that diet thing, I was at 195, but I'm at 210 again.  Okay.  Jeez.  What happened?  I don't know.  Food.  Food happened. 
[03:20:00]  Well, look.  This is the beginning of one of the duty videos, and it's visibly.  I mean, you were.  You look a lot thinner.  A lot.  That is pretty funny that you were skinny, and then you watched someone eat shit, and that  inspired you to eat a lot.  You'd think it might have had the opposite.  Hey, can we put Iraq on the scale?  I don't think he's 210, by the way.  I think he might be a little more than that.  I bet you he's wearing those boxer briefs, and I'll be fucking goddamned if he doesn't  look good.  By the way, Iraq.  In boxer briefs.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Iraq loves smelling fart boxes.  Does anyone have anything going on today in their pants?
