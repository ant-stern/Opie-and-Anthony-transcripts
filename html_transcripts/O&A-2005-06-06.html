<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and irreverent greeting, establishing their self-proclaimed "scumbag" status.  Opie detailed his daily, antagonistic yet ritualistic interactions with his building's security guard, who secretly sipped vodka.  The conversation then pivoted to the disappearance of a young woman in Aruba, with speculation ranging from foul play to the women's behavior and the chaperones' lax attitudes.  Callers contributed anecdotes, and the discussion became increasingly sexually explicit and crude.  One caller, Tim, defended Aruba's safety despite the ongoing investigation.  The hosts critiqued the media's coverage and conflicting reports.  Further caller anecdotes focused on infidelity and irresponsible vacation behavior.

The show then sharply criticized previous segments featuring strippers, expressing extreme dissatisfaction with their refusal to perform explicit acts on air, using highly offensive language and making violent threats. This transitioned to a similarly vulgar critique of a poorly performing hypnotist from a previous show.  Brief speculation on the Michael Jackson trial, including the alleged victim's drawing of Jackson's genitals, was also included. The segment concluded with complaints about listener message boards and the hosts' weariness of negative feedback.

The next segment focused on listener feedback, the humorous "Church of Opie" fan website (described with details like a potential "dog on a crucifix" image), the hosts' discomfort from the studio heat, Opie's health concerns (foot pain, breathing problems), and the evolving radio landscape, particularly the rise of the "Jack" format and the hosts' reaction to Cousin Brucie's commentary on CBS FM's format change (including a humorous imitation of Brucie's echo effect).  Eric, a staff member, was mentioned frequently.  Discussions also included a listener's plumbing disaster caused by excessive baby wipe usage, radio industry practices, pre-programmed playlists, listener request manipulation, and a lengthy anecdote about Opie abandoning a broken-down car.  Online message boards like Wackbag, OpieandAnthony.net, and CringeHumor.com were referenced.


A comedic bit mocking CBS FM followed, featuring increasingly absurd and offensive imitations of their DJs ("Terry Balls," "Harry Snatch," "Harry Sack"), nonsensical weather reports, sexually suggestive comments, and references to cloning monkeys. A caller, Frank, criticized the bit, prompting further vulgar responses.  This transitioned into a discussion of a Steven Tyler dream, Pat O'Brien's career, a darkly humorous commentary on a news story about a child with a brain tumor petting dolphins, and a conversation with Drew Curtis of Fark.com, touching upon online videos (a tasering incident and a pizza place fight) and bystander apathy.


A chaotic segment ensued, covering a Hindu wedding of giant toads, a woman smuggling fish (with ambiguous placement), and multiple accounts of babysitters engaging in sexual acts with underage children.  Listener calls detailed similar experiences.  Further Fark.com discussion, including adult critiques of children's artwork, was featured, with Drew Curtis again appearing as a guest.  The segment also covered Russell Crowe's arrest and Billy Crystal's allegedly poor Tony Awards performance (with comedic audio clips).  It concluded with a Gamefly.com promotion and discussions of video game addiction.  Vulgar language and sexually explicit descriptions were prevalent.


The final segment focused on the Tony Awards, specifically Hugh Jackman's performance, using homophobic language in the discussion.  The hosts and a caller, Nathaniel,  discussed Jackman's dual persona and speculated about the play's intimacy, using crude and offensive language.  The conversation moved to Mario Cantone's performance (deemed a "bomb") and an awkward phone call with Cantone himself and a woman from "Will & Grace." Big Kev reviewed the new Batman movie, interspersed with further Tony Awards discussions (including Elaine Stritch's alleged antics).  Homophobic slurs and derogatory comments about celebrities were frequent.  The segment touched upon other superhero movies. The show ended with a "What Did We Learn" segment and final offensive remarks.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for proper.  Here it goes!  Here it goes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Dave, oh, Dave.  Good luck, Dave.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Okay, terrific.  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now! 
[00:05:00]  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Wok, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Don't shoot, Lord!  Don't shoot!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[00:05:30]  Yeah!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Uh, no.  Sexy!  We like to call it the O and A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Growing every single day, man.  Yes.  Thanks to you people out there.  It's Monday.  What day is it?  It is Monday. 
[00:06:00]  Like June 6th or something like that?  Yeah.  It went from winter to summer in New York City?  Yeah, finally.  Finally, didn't need a jacket today.  And it only caused me problems.  Well, I get downstairs by the crack security guard, the drunk guy that's down there.  And I'm walking in, walking down the long granite hallway to his desk at the end of there,  waiting for my ritual that has been the same for a year. 
[00:06:30]  It's kind of like the Soup Nazi.  You've got to do it perfectly or there's going to be a problem.  That's why I do it the same way every morning.  I walk up, I give him a nod first.  It's a quick little, hmm, acknowledgement nod.  And then I hand him my card, my identity card, which he does something with behind the counter.  He swipes it somewhere, he does something with it, I'm still not sure, a year later.  As he's doing that, I'm signing in on the book, right under Scott Peterson or Batman or Arthur Ashe 
[00:07:00]  or some other smart-ass intern has signed in under some assumed name.  I signed in as Russell Crowe today.  Russell Crowe?  Yeah.  Did you hit the guy with a phone?  Go ahead.  So I sign in, he gives me the card back, and I go, have a good one.  And by one, I mean day.  That's usually what people say, have a good one.  And it means have a good day.  He gives me the card, says, you two. 
[00:07:30]  I walk to the elevator.  Done.  Today, I walk up, and it's so warm out, I didn't need a jacket.  I left the jacket at home, Opie.  Uh-oh, I know what's happening here.  Guess where the card has been for a year.  And that's his only job, so he takes it very seriously.  In my jacket pocket.  Right.  So what happened?  I had a problem, I said, and I had to add a whole new dialogue.  I said, well, see, it's pretty warm out there, and I didn't bring my jacket, and I don't have the card. 
[00:08:00]  And he looked a little troubled at first.  His face was kind of many.  And then he was like, all right, go ahead.  Like 365 times I've shown him the card.  Right.  You know, this time he's going to let it slide.  I could be an imposter.  Right.  Could be one of those Mission Impossible masks that I tear off of my face once I get in the elevator.  He's a little suspicious, but he's going to let you go ahead.  He's suspicious.  That guy's going to bust something apart.  Some big terrorism ring or something.  It's going to be him.  He's going to do it.  We almost came to blows a couple times, him and I. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you two don't get along very well.  No, now we're kind of like having a little thing.  Oh, but it'll come apart, the first sign of trouble.  A little thing, and then I was stupid enough to go, hey, where's your coffee today?  I don't drink coffee.  I don't drink coffee.  I go, I see you sip something every morning, because you notice that, too?  Yeah.  After he takes care of you, he reaches and takes an uncomfortable sip.  Yeah, what is that?  It's like some kind of OCD weird thing he does.  I think it's vodka.  You hand a card, you sign in, and then when you're done, he always reaches for what I 
[00:09:00]  thought was coffee and takes a sip and then just drops it down.  Every morning, same exact way, he does it.  Yeah.  So I didn't see the coffee, and I'm like, hey, where's your coffee this morning?  I don't drink coffee.  I don't drink coffee.  I play golf.  Isn't that Honeymooners one?  How's your wife?  I'm not married.  The one where he teaches him to play pool?  Or no, the one where he's golfing with him.  That was it.  What number is that?  Because I'm getting through the Honeymooners DVDs. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know the numbers.  All right.  I'm only up to like 10.  Really?  Yeah.  I haven't watched him in a while.  I've watched him a million times.  Then he's like, I'm trying to quit smoking.  Oh, is he?  And I go, because I want to relate.  I've never been a smoker in my life.  Maybe a little bar smoking here and there.  And I go, yeah, that's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  What are you going to do?  I'm just trying to relate to the guy in some way.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  Good luck with that. 
[00:10:00]  That was a good one.  Good comeback.  But this morning, he was in a full panic.  But I guess before you got there, he's on with somebody from the building going, ah,  the goddammit thing ain't working.  The air conditioning, yeah.  You better get someone down here immediately.  I think I could do his voice, actually.  I thought it was him for a second.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's what it is.  It's the air conditioning problem we have.  Well, that's not my responsibility.  He's just losing his mind.  He gave me some of that, too.  I didn't have the card, blah, blah, blah.  I go to walk around and he goes, he was on the phone with somebody. 
[00:10:30]  And he goes, yeah, there's no air conditioning up there.  But, you know, they're supposed to take care of that up there.  Like, I didn't understand if he meant the air conditioning people, us, the company, XM.  Yeah.  Like, he didn't want to be on that phone dealing with this.  So, it's got to be 90 degrees in the studio today.  No joke.  Very hot in here today.  Because it's close to, what, 75, 80 degrees outside already.  And it's just like, we can't open any windows.  And according to Ben, you know, the equipment might fail. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  Ben's like.  Pete Panic.  Well, Ben is like, what were we just saying?  I want to, like, I want to write a book about Ben called Culture of Ben instead of Culture  of Fear.  Because everything is hyper-exaggerated with him.  You know what Ben is?  Ben is a frowning doctor walking into a waiting room.  That's what he is.  It's like, the AC ain't working and Mars is telling me the equipment could go down at any 
[00:11:30]  second.  Frowning doctor.  Well, um, why don't you sit down?  That was, ah.  Ah, no way I can do this.  The whole, the whole system could go down.  Everything could melt.  Mars is in there trying to hold it all together with, I don't know, he's using a fan or something.  All right.  So we'll do a show until the equipment fails us today.  Breaks down.  Should the equipment be fine?  I'm sure it will be, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Because as soon as Ben said that, I was all excited, like, ooh. 
[00:12:00]  It's almost like, you know, when you get a snow day from school.  Yeah.  Or whatever you have in the Midwest.  Well, not Midwest, it snows.  Down there in the South and stuff.  I don't know what you guys have.  Maybe a day off because a hurricane's coming or something.  Hurricane day.  Or a tornado just took out your whole trailer park.  I don't know.  Whatever happens.  Whatever happens down there.  But I got a little excited.  Then I realized the info was coming from Ben.  I'm like, no, we'll be here until 11.  10.58 and then our luck, that's when the equipment will fail.  On the replace.  Right.  Yeah, join the replace when it doesn't matter. 
[00:12:30]  But there you have it.  All right.  Wow, a lot's going on this morning, huh?  Oh, my God.  The news is just full of stuff.  Who the hell's going to Aruba anytime soon?  A lot of people go down there and a lot of people have fun and enjoy themselves.  But every time you ask people, you know, where to go on vacation, one of the number one places they always say is Aruba.  Aruba is the place to go.  But this isn't good for tourism, what's happening over there, huh?  Not for Aruba, no. 
[00:13:00]  But this is, you know, I'd like to be a little sympathetic, but this is stupid, young, Midwest girl.  And what, you went on some kind of high school seniors trip?  Nice, nice, huh?  For your senior trip, you go to Aruba?  You know what I did?  Six chaperones or something?  You know what I did for my senior trip?  Yeah.  I think I went to Great Adventure and a diner.  Oh, there you go.  It was nice.  But nowadays, these seniors, they get to go to exotic lands.  I was able to go to a spring break down in Florida when I was in college. 
[00:13:30]  Same element of danger down there at Great Adventure.  Yeah, no doubt, man.  No effing doubt.  What happened to Naruba?  I didn't hear.  This high school girl, hot, senior, blonde, was last seen with three locals down there.  Locals.  Getting into the locals' car.  And they say, yeah, they drove and dropped her off at the hotel at like 2 in the morning. 
[00:14:00]  But apparently, the surveillance film at the hotel does not show her going to the hotel.  They've arrested a couple of guys, but not any of the locals that had driven her apparently to her hotel or allegedly to her hotel.  So it's still up in the air.  Something tells me law enforcement down there isn't so good.  They don't have much crime down there as far as the tourists go.  They have stabbings and stuff among the locals, but as far as the tourists go, because you're supposed to stay on the compound, you know? 
[00:14:30]  You're supposed to stay in the areas designated for the tourists.  They look nice.  It's all familiar surroundings.  You're in your hotel.  There's plenty of shops right in the hotel.  Right.  No need to drive around.  Everything is all nice and set up for you.  Set up.  Coconut drinks with umbrellas.  Right on the beach, right by the hotel.  You don't stray either way down the beach.  It looks like you could keep straying, but they got it set up in a way where they got kind of guards over there warning you you might not want to go any further. 
[00:15:00]  Don't go any further.  The beach here is the same beach you're going to get down there, except there's some locals down there.  When I was at the Atlantis there in the Bahamas, you went there as well, Anthony, a while back.  You know that beach?  I saw drunk college girls because it was like spring break time.  Oh, let's go take a walk.  And the sun's going down.  And all of a sudden they just start walking off into the distance.  I'm like, oh, dead. 
[00:15:30]  Dead.  Because it's like, for lack of a better term, it's the dark side.  It gets very dark in many ways as you head down the beach.  It's very creepy.  Away from your hotel.  The safety of your hotel.  And this chick, you know, she's hanging out at this bar.  It's pretty popular down there, I guess.  And she leaves with three locals.  How do you do that, first of all? 
[00:16:00]  How do your friends allow you to do that?  Their friends knew she left with these three guys.  Three locals.  How many feet of cock do you need, lady?  Jesus Christ.  Three locals.  You're talking, that's got to be close to what?  It's probably three feet of dick.  I was going to go with four.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You think one guy's a little...  Oh, yeah.  We've had this discussion where, you know, you let your lady go on vacation with a friend.  Oh, never.  And then she goes banging all the locals and stuff. 
[00:16:30]  There's not one guy that could turn to his co-workers or friends or anything and go,  Oh, yeah, my chick went down.  Yeah, her and her girlfriend went down to Aruba.  Yeah, her and one of her friends from work went to the Bahamas.  You know, so it's cool.  I get to hang out all week.  Yeah, he's fucking around playing poker with his friends.  They're hanging out a little late at the strip club or the bar or something.  And she is just getting a baby's arm clutching an apple, smacking her in the face. 
[00:17:00]  Forget about it.  They go down there to get hammered.  Yeah, you're at the strip club and this is what's going on.  If your chick is telling you she's going to the Caribbean without you with her girlfriends,  the relationship's done.  It's over.  Let's just put it this way.  When she gets back, the sex is going to be a lot different.  Forget about it.  You're not even going to be able to feel the side walls anymore.  One of those things you can't say but you know in bed, you'll be fucking her going,  This feels different. 
[00:17:30]  This is big.  How could I possibly now say,  Uh, honey, is your pussy bigger than it was before you left?  Honey, can you close your legs?  Yeah, tighten up.  I can't come unless you throw chicken blood on her.  I'm going to put it in.  Could you cross your ankles and squeeze because it's just not doing it.  And this happens.  They do that.  Not even with a crime.  This is like one of the guys maybe that serves the coconut drinks on the beach. 
[00:18:00]  Why don't you come back to my place?  Oh, he seems like such a nice guy.  Oh, I'm going to go with him tonight.  You go, girl.  You have a good time.  We're on vacation.  What happens when Aruba stays in?  Shut up.  A lot of people calling in saying Aruba is not like that.  We understand that.  What?  It's not?  But it's a sad story out of Aruba today.  How is Aruba not like that, though?  Well, let's go to the phone and see what Tim has to say about that. 
[00:18:30]  Tim, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Why?  Because your chick went to Aruba without you, right?  No, no, no.  Actually, I engaged my chick down there in Aruba.  And we almost got married there, but we decided to do it here in the States.  Anyways, dude.  No one cares.  Aruba is totally safe, man.  You go there.  We got there.  We jumped off the plane.  First thing we did, rented a Jeep.  You go anywhere on that island you want to.  It is so safe.  You can't get lost down there.  The island is way too small.  Even if you do, eventually you hit a place that's like you know where you're at. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Now, there's parts of downtown.  It's kind of like D.C.  It's like, okay, you don't go over there.  All right.  Exactly.  Well, that's the part.  That's probably.  No, where she was at?  Carlos and Charlie's.  Now, all the reports read, oh, she was eating and dancing at Carlos and Charlie's.  Let me tell you, the drinking age down there, 18.  She was trashed.  There's no way she came out to Carlos and Charlie's anywhere near sober.  She had to have been drunk.  Now, I mean, I might be out, you know, not speaking. 
[00:19:30]  I'm speaking a little bit out of terms here, but she had to have been drunk.  Of course she was.  But Aruba is a safe place.  Aruba's one of those places where you don't have to stay on the compound.  Not like some of the other people.  Yeah, just like she.  Just like she did.  Dude, you're saying how safe it is.  There's at least three guys and maybe more, maybe five guys that are responsible for this girl missing.  Well, see, that's the other strange thing about all the reports.  If you pull up all the AP reports and whatever on the net, at one point in time, they're saying there's 40 chaperones. 
[00:20:00]  At the other point in time, they're saying there's two to seven.  Right.  So what's the reality there?  I'm not sure what the truth is.  Well, you've got to think, if you're a chaperone on a trip like that, you're in the bar drinking as well.  Yeah, you're not paying attention.  Well, that's exactly what one of the reports said.  They said, well, chaperones are different.  You're trying to have sex with the 18-year-old girls.  Of course, because the laws are different in Aruba.  Right.  There you go.  They are.  They're totally different in Aruba.  All right, Tim.  Tim, stop babbling because we've got some really good phone calls coming in.  Thank you.  Aruba's not like that.  I like it in all the reports, too. 
[00:20:30]  It's like the chief of police, Jan Herkenfergenstein.  Or like Dutch, I guess.  Yeah.  They had a hot blonde that's an attorney or something.  Janssen Janssen, Vern.  Yeah.  They had a hot blonde.  Maybe we could get audio of her.  She's one of the attorneys down there in Aruba.  Yeah.  Looking like she should speak regular English.  And man, I couldn't believe what was coming out of her mouth.  I hate when they take you, like, they knock you for a loop.  Yeah.  It's like...  That happens at the gas station sometimes. 
[00:21:00]  Because some of these guys, I don't know how it works, but they look like you're from  California or something.  Yeah.  They're like, hey, buddy, you know, how do you get to Main Street?  Get it, get it, take it.  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  I wouldn't have asked you if you looked the part.  At least put some shoe polish on your face or something.  Classic.  Let's go to Chad in Nebraska, because this is something we have to talk about today.  Well, let him say it, and then we'll move on from here.  Go ahead, Chad.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:21:30]  I had the opposite thing happen to me last year.  I went to Cancun with some buddies that I work with, and I came back and found out that  my old lady was screwing everybody in town.  Don't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't get no ass down there.  Well, the guys don't.  The girls, if a girl and her girlfriend are going to the Caribbean on a vacation, they're  fucking.  They are getting laid.  It's going to happen.  Anthony and I saw it firsthand.  There was a whole bunch of people from our old radio station. 
[00:22:00]  This goes back to the AF days, and we went to Turks and Caicos on Jim Cook's Dime.  Big Sam Adams party down there broadcasting live.  It was a lot of fun.  We went on the booze cruise, where they're pretty much saying what happens on the booze cruise  stays on the booze cruise.  On the way home, the captain of the ship started driving really slow because he was too busy  dry-humping this chick.  She was playing with this hog, and I think, Anthony, that she actually went down on him,  if you remember.  Yeah, there was something going on.  There was something going on behind the big podium thing. 
[00:22:30]  That the ship's wheel is on.  Yeah, the ship's wheel in the back.  That's why they called him the first mate.  Exactly.  Thanks, Chad.  I needed that help.  What a great one.  That stunk.  And this girl, she was pretty much a whore all week long at Turks and Caicos Club Med.  And we touched down at JFK, and we're all getting our baggage.  And you see the people you're with all week.  The welcome.  It's the welcome home.  As soon as we walk out of JFK, there's her boyfriend, and she runs into her boyfriend's 
[00:23:00]  arms and starts giving him a nice sloppy kiss.  Yeah.  With the same mouth that she was going down on the captain with.  On some peeler from down there.  No, he was the white dude, remember?  He was getting laid off.  I forgot his name, and I asked him.  I asked him during the buffet.  I'm like, how long have you been here?  He goes, 25 years.  I'm never leaving.  Of course he's not.  Of course you're not leaving.  He's got something great.  And then there was the other guy, the black guy with the dreads.  Yeah, I forgot his name.  He was just, like, trying to hit on every single girl. 
[00:23:30]  Right in front of boyfriends, husbands.  This guy is just, it's all good, man.  Unbelievable, these guys.  They work it.  They really do work it down there.  But I guess with this story in Aruba, it's not good, but they have called in the dive team.  Yes, they've asked for assistance from the FBI dive team, which, oh, you just never want that.  It's never like the FBI dive team has come in because maybe you want some gold doubloons, and they'll find it for you. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  They're just coming up with bodies.  It's never going to end with good news after the dive team's been out there a while.  We found her, and she's alive because, you see, there was a sunken ship, and there was an air pocket.  There was air in there.  And there was just enough air to keep her alive until we found her.  Yeah.  She's fine.  She was chasing a turtle, and that's what happened.  There was no sexual assault. 
[00:24:30]  There was no drowning.  She's fine.  And when they bring in the dive team, they know they've exhausted all the other possibilities  and, like, all right, dredge the ocean.  We've got to find her.  The best you can hope for as a parent is to get her all back, not just pieces.  Yeah, well, let's go to Phil in Minnesota.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, O.N.A.  Hey.  Hey, Gumdrop.  How you doing?  What up, Phil?  Okay.  Hey, I think everybody's missing the big picture here.  I think her friends killed her. 
[00:25:00]  What?  Yeah.  What was that movie?  Four or five girls, they all go somewhere, and she gets drunk.  She admits screwing one of her boyfriends, and they all tag up and kill her, put her in  the swamp, fed her to the fishes.  Nah, she's an 18-year-old girl, completely hammered, probably, I'm assuming, with her  friends, and maybe started talking to some of these locals, and unfortunately, one of  these locals is a bad guy.  I don't know.  Maybe she didn't want to go all the way, CT a little bit, guy couldn't take it, choked 
[00:25:30]  her with his own penis.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, Phil.  Yep.  They charged two guys with that, though.  Yeah, they got two guys so far.  They arrested him.  They're not giving details, and no one knows, like, what they're being charged with, and  they're not one of the, any of the three guys that drove her home that was supposed to.  The guys are security guards in a hotel that's being renovated.  Oh, really?  That's nice.  Your security guards are being charged with probably a rape and a murder.  Uh-huh.  That's nice.  I always think about it, when I go on vacation, when I was at Atlantis, and you just see these 
[00:26:00]  drunk girls just, like, on spring break, just, oh, let's go find some pot!  And just start walking down the beach, I'm like, are we...  I know where we can find some!  Are you insane?  Yeah.  You just go down to the beach!  Let's just keep walking, and one of the locals will have some!  The sun's going down, and you're like, oh, man.  Will you please turn around?  I don't even know you.  Will you just turn around?  Yeah.  For the love of God.  For the love of God.  For your own life.  I'm saving your life right here. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, because the resorts are, you know, they're set up sweet for you.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Tim from Pennsylvania has a point about the parents.  I mean, I don't know.  I guess you've got to give them freedom, but...  Go ahead, Tim.  Yeah.  I mean, what the hell's wrong with these parents?  Somebody ought to interview them and find out.  You know what?  Let's send our kids down to Aruba and learn how to play Canasta.  I mean, what do they think they're going to do down there?  I think she's 18, though, right?  Yeah, but I mean...  What does that matter? 
[00:27:00]  I mean, you can't tell them not to go.  When we were growing up, 18 was the drinking age, and my parents wouldn't let me go to...  You can tell them not to go.  Some exotic island?  She's still living at home?  I don't know.  I think that's parental peer pressure.  Parents are just vowing to peer pressure.  You know, well, Janie's going, so let me go.  This stuff very rarely happens, though, man.  In fairness to the islands, you very rarely hear about somebody going to Aruba and you're missing on spring break or whatever it is.  Disappearing.  Unfortunately, this is one of those rare things, and you've still got to live your life.  You can't get all scared and paranoid.  I bet there's a lot of rape, though. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Date rape, drug, that type of stuff.  Yeah, some of that stuff.  I'm sure it happens in Fort Lauderdale, too.  I mean, I'm sure a couple people have turned up missing over the...  If you go back 30 years, something has happened.  Yeah.  All right.  Watch it out, guys.  Thank you.  There is a...  You know, we talk about this every morning.  There's a car crash every single morning.  We had no idea this was going on until we...  There's plenty of them, but then there's always a big one.  Until we started doing morning radio.  But every morning, there's a car crash, and it's the car crash of the morning on the local TV here in New York. 
[00:28:00]  They have a horrific one in Stanford, Connecticut, where the car...  They showed it.  It's flat on the road and smeared.  Yeah, it looked like the car was made out of, like, cream cheese, and you smeared it on a...  How you would smear it on a bagel.  It was completely flattened to the road, and we're trying to figure out, how did that happen?  The tires were, like, flat on the ground.  The car itself, completely flattened.  Like, you couldn't even tell what kind of car it was.  It's like, uh...  Some blankets thrown over it. 
[00:28:30]  Kind of like if Godzilla just crushed the car as he's walking toward Manhattan.  That's it.  Tracked a trailer.  Like, ran over it or something.  That's weird.  That's what it looked like.  All right.  Let's go to Doug.  Hey, Doug.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to point out something.  About five years ago, in Pennsylvania, we had a...  I don't know what the hell the parent was thinking, but she let her 15-year-old daughter  go with a bunch of friends alone down to Ocean City, and she went to a nightclub, and they 
[00:29:00]  found her in the ditch the next morning.  So, I mean, it happens up here, too, just not down there.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Unfortunately, it happens from time to time everywhere, but...  I mean, I thought that they should have thrown the parents.  I mean, who lets a 15-year-old girl go unsupervised with other 15- and 16-year-olds  to Ocean City for the weekend or whatever?  Plenty of perical stupidity.  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  New York, checking in.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, sweet tits.  That's very mean-spirited, sir.  Let's get the call.  Not you. 
[00:29:30]  Listen, I was down in a room about eight years ago.  They have sharks all around the island, and they feed the sharks on the north side of  the island, because all the resorts are on the south side of the island, and they keep  the sharks away from the south side by feeding them up in the north.  This bitch is in with the sharks.  There's no two ways about it.  No two ways about it.  This guy knows.  This guy knows how to dispose of a body, obviously.  And then he goes, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  They're tracing the call. 
[00:30:00]  It's coming from upstairs.  Rob in New Jersey.  What's going on, boys?  At least when they find this girl's body, it'll be cheaper to go to Aruba for the rest  of us.  You think they'll drop prices?  Oh, yeah.  Try to bring tourists back.  Yeah, because we all are a bunch of dummies.  Millions and millions of people go there every year, and it takes one of these, and all of  a sudden, airfare is cheap, and the hotels drop their prices for a little while.  I know three strippers I'd like to send down there.  From Friday show. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I thought we were just going to forget about Friday show.  So, I listened to the replay, and it had its moments early on.  Right.  That's pretty good.  I was laughing at the Edmund Fitzgerald bit.  It was very funny.  This is what I got to tell people, and I'm done with the message boards.  I really am, because these guys are just completely negative, and they pick apart every show,  every little thing that we do.  We need the people that understand what this radio show is all about to start posting on 
[00:31:00]  these message boards, or we should just ignore them completely, because it's really ridiculous.  They do, though.  It's completely ridiculous.  It's such a small percentage of the message board people that get on there.  But they take over.  They take over the whole message board.  But that's the whole thing of any message board on the internet for any subject whatsoever.  I mean, here's the reality.  You know, we do a four-hour original show every day.  Some days, unfortunately, we're going to bomb completely.  We haven't had a bad show in a while, and most shows have at least a couple segments that 
[00:31:30]  are just priceless, you know?  We're at the price of admission.  Like, a Friday show, in my opinion, was awful, but the Gordon Lightfoot bit was probably one  of the best bits we, or I should say Anthony and Jimmy, it was mostly you guys.  That's one of the best bits we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  It was a lot of fun.  It was absolutely amazing how funny that bit was.  But then these, I mean, these guys, they take one thing, and they just blow it out of  proportion, and it's just getting ridiculous. 
[00:32:00]  It's not even worth reading the boards anymore.  That's only a few, though.  Yeah, because the majority of the people do get it, and actually, we're writing, you  know, that happens, I love this, but the end of the show sucked, and that's what happens.  Right.  That's what happens when you put on a live show on a daily basis.  Yeah, you're not going to get four good hours every day, and people that don't get that  come off looking really stupid anyway on the board, and they get ripped apart by the  other people there, so I had no problem with Friday.  I thought the beginning of the show and the Edmund Fitzgerald thing, very funny. 
[00:32:30]  Very entertaining to listen back to.  And then the stripper thing.  Well, and the funny thing is-  No more strippers.  Strippers, they stink.  Well, this has been an ongoing thing with the show, and we're just hating the strippers.  We just are.  And Steve is like, Steve wants, he's emailing us weekly about this girl, you know, wants  to come in and do this, and they never do anything.  Because they got nothing. 
[00:33:00]  They don't know what to do on the radio.  And going into Friday's show, I go, Steve, oh man, more strippers, you know, what's up?  And he's like, no, these, they said they would do anything.  Anything.  And it's always the way.  They always say that.  We had three strippers.  One girl flashed us for maybe five seconds.  Yeah.  And that's not even good enough.  Even if the girls got topless or naked, that's not good enough.  No, they have to be ramming, ramming shit inside themselves.  That's it.  It's like, there isn't this thing where we have to, they come in and we go, hey, could  we see your boobies? 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Could we see a little ass?  No.  Well, and then we beg for another 10 minutes and stuff.  They should walk through that door completely naked.  They should be naked, coming in and just, what do you want me to put in my snatch?  Pointing at the Lysol can, the microphone, I don't care what, anything.  It shouldn't be an argument.  But it's always this, no, no.  You say something like, hey, are we going to see anyone naked?  And they look at each other and start like shaking their head no and making eyes at like 
[00:34:00]  whoever they brought with them.  Like, I didn't say I'd do this.  I don't want to do this.  Why the fuck are you here?  Exactly.  My God.  I wish I had more balls to throw them out earlier.  I really do.  I was annoyed at myself.  I kept thinking, just get out.  And I didn't have the balls to say it.  Next time, someone has to throw them out.  One of us three.  Next time when we see something like that's happening, in any situation, we ought to have  something where one of us has to get the job.  We should have the shitty stripper guest dice that we have to roll. 
[00:34:30]  And whoever loses has to fucking do it in a heartless, heartless manner.  I'm usually pretty good at that, but I was just so annoyed and like, ugh, whatever.  Just let this show die then.  It was just...  Then the hypnotist, oh my God, did he stink on us.  I forgot about him.  And then freaking Steve was telling me that, you know, his manager has been begging Steve  for like six months to get him on the show.  And then the guy just completely...  What, are you hypnotized, Steve?  Completely bombed.  You will book me on the show, Steve. 
[00:35:00]  I was getting sleepy.  I was getting sleepy.  You will book me.  Steve, never again.  No more strippers ever.  No, I wholeheartedly agree with that.  Yeah, that was awful.  That was...  You know what?  Oates heard the conversations I've had with these guys that own strip clubs.  And I'm not tame.  I'm not vague when I talk to them.  I am very, very blunt.  And I say, look, if you bring in girls here that aren't going to perform, that aren't going  to get naked, you are going to not... 
[00:35:30]  Not only are you not welcome, but you're going to have crying bitches on your hands.  So...  I am not interested.  Oh, yeah.  And they went away crying Friday, Steve.  Oh, I know.  Because we're so brave around here.  But the reality...  I get...  I get lied to all the time.  All the guys in strip clubs say, okay, yeah, yeah, don't worry, don't worry.  They're all nuts.  They're all crazy.  Then they get here, and the girls have no idea why they're up there.  You know why?  Because the guy from the strip clubs, all they want to do is get a plug for their club.  Right.  Yep.  So they're not going, going, hey, you know, make sure you do this.  They just go, three girls, boom, boom, boom, you, you, you. 
[00:36:00]  Let's go, we're going on the radio.  They're going to ask you maybe to show a tit or something, but just come down.  Yeah.  Hoping they get their plug, and they don't care what these girls do or if it's entertaining  for our listeners or anything.  They just want to get the plug.  Exactly.  They got no plug.  No more.  Nope.  Yeah, we're done with the strippers.  I mean, if they want to come on the show, good luck even.  No, strippers don't work.  Even attempting.  They would have to have something where they say, I'm coming in to do this, and we would 
[00:36:30]  have to go, wow, that's really cool.  Okay, come down.  And if they didn't do it within the first minute.  We get to chop off a finger?  A finger?  That's it.  Just hack their head off.  Well, they should be.  Leave them in a ditch.  Let's make them sign a contract.  If they don't perform, we get to take a butcher knife to their, like, which finger do you  want to take?  I say the pinky finger.  No, the ring finger.  Bolt cutter.  Bolt cutter's better.  Yeah, the ring finger.  That's the most important body part on a woman.  But again, if you start with the pinky finger and you're... 
[00:37:00]  Where are you going to put that silly wedding ring, huh?  On the ring finger?  You want that one taken off?  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Wow.  That's heartless.  You're never going to get the engagement ring on that finger.  Just pops it right off with a bolt cutter.  Make sure it's nice and close so they can't fake it and slide one on the stub.  But then they can place it there and then maybe have a rubber band that wraps around their  wrist.  No, they'd wear it, like, on the other hand. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe we should just eliminate both ring fingers.  Yeah, that would be good.  If they screw up.  All right, well, we're done with strippers.  Adult talent.  No, the adult talent barely does anything.  Well, the problem is the adult talent's all based on the West Coast, and if you want  to book them...  They suck, too.  They fucking come in here.  You can watch a video of them right on the screen in the same room with them.  We have watched video of them doing horrific things to their bodies.  What about the girl that was sitting on Jay Moore's lap that was in that gangbang video?  Yeah.  What was it called?  The Baker's Dozen? 
[00:38:00]  The Baker's Dozen.  She's sucking 13 guys off.  13 guys.  She's taking it in the ass, in her pussy, everything.  We ask if she'll take the wiffle bat in her.  Oh, no.  I don't...  Oh.  She didn't even get naked.  No.  Didn't even get fucking naked.  I thought she did.  They're awful.  She didn't get naked?  I remember.  And we don't want her sitting there with the top off.  I think she did, actually.  No girl sitting with a friggin' top off.  It's not going to do it.  They have to be not a stitch of fucking clothes on.  I want a sign on that door that basically says, strippers, remove clothes before entering. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  No clothes beyond this point.  Right.  If you're a stripper.  I hate watching Jimmy begging to see their gash.  Right.  Could you do this?  Could you do...  Take your clothes off.  Yeah, that's the new sign for the door.  Okay.  Strippers, before entering, remove all clothes.  How about all non-males, regardless of your job title?  It could get ugly.  It certainly couldn't get ugly.  If you're a female, you have to be nude to be in the studio.  Hi.  I brought you some chicken.  Good point, Ant.  How are you?  What am I dropping?  Thank you. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  I'm so sick of people...  How you doing?  I pay attention to the sign.  Oh.  I'm so sick of people just, you know, bringing this show to a screeching hall.  Oh, my God.  When it's Ant, myself, and Jimmy, we know how to do radio.  And then you get these people in here.  These strippers and things.  And now the show's just waiting to happen.  Now we're just sitting here waiting.  When if they weren't around, we'd still be, you know, attempting to make people laugh  and shock you a little bit and make you think. 
[00:39:30]  Plenty more Yates jokes.  Exactly.  If there were that day, that's for sure.  Thank God.  And the strippers come in and just...  Let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, gentlemen.  What's going on?  What's up?  I have to agree with you 100% about that goddamn message board.  And you know what?  They're a good thing for the show and everything.  But there's fucks like Fast Freddy from Jamaica who have to post on these things a million  times.  And then you go on there and you make a comment.  They're like, oh, you have no rep cred, whatever.  I've been watching this show since you guys started.  You know what I mean? 
[00:40:00]  They're stupid assholes.  They sit there and try to get their post count up.  So if they're a guy that has like 1,400 posts, he knows more than the guy that has like 300  posts.  So he'll kick him around.  It's like a little power base for people.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're going to be posting on these message boards, at least understand the basics  of the show, like what everyone does on the show maybe.  They won't.  They can never understand that.  It's amazing.  Not everybody will understand.  And this will be, you could go to the message board for anything. 
[00:40:30]  Any message board for any subject, you'll get the same thing.  Who has a job?  I mean, what do these people do?  Do they have jobs that they have to like, well, how do you have?  I only have like 35 posts because I'm all working every day.  But that doesn't mean that, you know, I have XM.  I don't even switch the channels on my XM.  I bought XM for you.  You know what I mean?  It's just 24 hours a day.  And I catch the whole show, man.  It's great.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We appreciate that.  All right, Steve.  So there, I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  I'm so, I'm just so done.  Yeah.  You just, you try to.  And what's up with the hypnotist?  That was the, that guy was the biggest hack I've ever seen.  That guy's manager.  I've been doing radio for a really long time.  That guy could be the biggest hack we've ever had on the show.  He wasn't even a good hypnotist.  And hypnotists always suck on the radio.  And he wasn't even good at that.  His manager came after me for three months.  And I said no easily half a dozen times.  And finally I said, look, buddy, if your guy comes in here and hangs himself, I can't say I didn't warn you. 
[00:41:30]  And that was it.  He had no charisma.  He wasn't exciting on the air or anything.  Even these dopey friggin' hypnotist phony asses.  At least if they have like a show or some kind of personality.  Like, you know, he gets on mic and starts going, well, we've got the girls in there.  And what I've done is I put them under a spell in some kind of an energetic voice.  He was like, yeah, yeah, they, I put them under. 
[00:42:00]  But he couldn't even, he couldn't even put under the friend of his that he brought with him.  No, because he brought two marks.  He brought two marks that were supposed to be the ones that, like, actually get hypnotized.  And they couldn't even, they couldn't even fake it for their friend.  They couldn't fake it.  Even for their buddy.  Knowing that this was a big deal for the guy.  Like, hack.  I want to get a, like a cop, like one of those hypnotists that works for the police department  and, like, regresses people for license plates.  Like, one of those people that's at least got a legitimate job in that field. 
[00:42:30]  That would be cool.  That I want to try.  Like, someone that's not a showman that actually just does it because they need information.  On stage with the same hack.  I was going to say.  The same hack little things where, in the other room, they were discussing what they were going to do.  And it's like, oh, look at Steve.  Now, when you, when I snap my fingers, he's going to have the biggest penis hanging right out of his pants.  And you're going to, okay, go.  Go.  Why do you have that hanging there? 
[00:43:00]  Well, they look at it and just start giggling to themselves.  And then you have to go, what's wrong, ladies?  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.  One of the funniest friggin' Simpsons ever was when Homer got hypnotized.  And I wish I could remember any of the lines or anything, but if you've seen it, you know how goddamn funny it is.  It's such a great riff on hypnotists and what they're supposed to do and be on stage.  Funny as hell.  Can we get those clips for the show, you think? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, try to find those, because it is so goddamn funny.  Yeah, because after having El Hacco in Friday, it would be a lot of fun to play those clips, maybe tomorrow or later today.  It's something on the lines of the hypnotist tells the Homer, like, hey, you're Tom Cruise.  And he goes, woo, I'm Tom Cruise.  Like, it doesn't do anything different than just be Homer on stage.  That's great.  They are the worst goddamn hack.  They're worse than the worst hack comic on stage when you see these guys. 
[00:44:00]  You go to a club, and they bring a hypnotist out.  Oh!  And they sell out.  You dummies out there that love these morons.  They do these clubs two weeks in a row, they sell.  Who is going to see this shit?  The same people that are watching Joey on NBC.  Ugh.  You know what I mean?  That's the same mentality.  Joey!  Oof.  Is it good?  I don't know.  I have never seen an episode of Joey in my life.  Me neither.  All right, enough of that.  We got the, you know. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, can we send maybe an intern for a fan?  Is there a possibility we can get a fan in the doorway?  It's fucking, it's brutal in here.  Like one of those oscillating.  Oh my God, Opie, you are fucking soaked.  And he never sweats.  And I never, you're like a mannequin.  I really never sweat either.  You're right.  I am soaked.  Steve came in blotting himself.  Oh, shock.  I just, I'm a very, I'm a large sweaty individual.  You are really sweating.  You're a gamey chimp is what you are.  The sweaty bear. 
[00:45:00]  It is bad.  I picked the wrong day to wear sleeves, apparently.  Why is the Reverend Jesse Jackson supporting Michael Jackson on TV right now?  I don't know, melanin.  I mean, I can't imagine why he'd support him.  The only reason.  Jackson was in the hospital again.  I was telling Anthony before the show, you know, I have a slight back, like, problem right now.  I just, slight, I pull the muscle, whatever, it's no big deal.  I betcha his, because I think he went in because he has a back problem.  It was a back problem.  It had earlier been reported as flu-like symptoms. 
[00:45:30]  He's been hospitalized for that.  It's probably the basic stuff that any of us get, just living life, and he goes right to the hospital for him.  You know, you get a slight back problem, what do you get?  You take a few aspirin there and you go to work, you know?  Where's that siren coming from?  We have all the windows open and everything.  We're trying to get any kind of...  It is?  It's like real city noises, not sound effects?  No, no, that's an actual somebody going by there.  You think Michael Jackson really had the flu, or he just had his head in his boy's lap and it looked like he was coughing? 
[00:46:00]  He's going to walk.  It's so obvious.  When is this done?  I'm spitting out what people thought was phlegm.  Are they deliberated today, this morning?  Boy, I'm not sure.  I think they started deliberations today.  Have they?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, he'll walk, probably as early as today.  He will absolutely walk.  What's this picture of the kid, of his mule that some kid drew?  Oh, that is great.  It's on Drudge.  It's a drawing and some notes that one of the young victims drew and described to his father 
[00:46:30]  about Michael Jackson's penis and his whole genital area and its surroundings and how it's blotchy.  There's a picture of a mushroom kind of looking thing.  By the way, how do you talk to your father about that?  I have enough problems asking my dad how to kiss a girl when I was in fourth grade.  How do you describe the cock of a pop superstar?  Let me tell you, hey, pop boy, let me describe to you Michael Jackson's dick.  His father probably asked him if it was really dark.  They were both turned on.  He's like, how big was it? 
[00:47:00]  Under an afghan?  Well, he drew some kind of a skinny-looking short shaft with a very triangular-shaped head on it.  It looks like a garden gnome.  Yeah.  And then there's notes that some of them are kind of hard to read.  One says, body oil stink.  Like there was some kind of body oil and it stunk down there.  A brown patch on ass. 
[00:47:30]  Bleaching cream.  Orietta?  No?  I don't know what that is.  Yeah.  Body oil stink.  Wow, is that what that means?  Is it a smell?  You think it's bag smelled?  Probably is.  Hey, I like bag stink.  Body odor.  He has scrotum flakes.  Ew.  He had gamey balls.  It's very funny.  Grease.  Jesus.  E.  And then he has, my theory, ass bleach.  Brown, something brown. 
[00:48:00]  Everyone can see brown down there.  So, like, apparently he was bleaching his ass also.  Like he's bleaching his whole body to get rid of that blackness that he hates so much about himself.  And the kid, like, saw that, described it, and drew a picture of his penis.  But this is, you know, it's not evidence.  93, that's wrong.  Is it 93?  The only thing that might trip up Michael Jackson in this whole case is the fact that the judge said it's okay for the prosecution to bring up past allegations of sexual misconduct with children. 
[00:48:30]  Nah, he's walking.  Just another circus by the L.A. prosecutors.  Another media circus that these dummies cannot handle.  They are completely incompetent, especially when it comes to a high-profile case like this.  They can't close the deal.  That Robert Blake case, how guilty is Robert Blake?  You don't even have to go to the O.J. thing, of course.  But how guilty is Robert Blake?  The guy shot his wife in the car. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And, bah, bah, nothing.  And his excuse was he went back to get his gun.  Yeah.  He just went back to get my gun.  See, I didn't even have my gun with me.  Right.  How bad of an excuse is that?  I had a gun that I would have shot it with, but it was in the restaurant, as coincidence would have it, while she was shot.  All right, I'd buy that.  The original L.A. cops, the original Rodney King beating, they had to get them on civil rights charges, I think.  And then the, uh, Reginald Denny, they got those guys, I think.  They went to jail immediately. 
[00:49:30]  Did they actually go to jail?  Well, I think they originally, I think they got convicted immediately.  I remember seeing Reginald Denny on TV a couple of years after that, forgiving them for what they did.  Hug the guy?  With his claved in head.  Yeah.  How do you do, I'm sorry.  There is no amount of this forgiveness.  Another victim forgiving?  Oh.  It's an empowerment thing, I think.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  You feel empowered when you have the, you know, I forgive you.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  There was a ring around my tub, so he hit me in the skull. 
[00:50:00]  Left the house and he started shooting at me.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  All right, why don't we do one more thing before we take a break, Anthony?  Well, if we go, and we might even break out a classic O&A bit.  Oh.  Which one's that, Opie?  Instead of playing awful XM promos today, let's see.  Listen to this quote and try to figure out who said this, okay, Jimmy?  Oh, wait.  Somebody's got it.  Dan from Hoboken.  Yeah.  It was Mesmerino was the hypnotist, and he said, 
[00:50:30]  When I snap my fingers, you will transform into a famous historian.  And Homer goes, Look at me.  I'm a famous historian.  Out of my way.  And then he goes, Now you're Emily Dickinson.  Homer goes, Look at me.  I'm Angie Dickinson.  Can we get those clips, Eric, you think?  Was Homer faking it?  Of course he was.  Oh, it's awesome.  He just wanted to be like the center of attention.  So he's running around the stage.  Very cool.  But then he really did hypnotize him, and that's when he starts screaming. 
[00:51:00]  This guy was hypnotized to quit smoking.  Jim, how did that work out for you?  It didn't work out very well at all.  There was like 80 of us in one room.  80?  Yeah, in a hotel room.  It was like a ballroom type thing.  And this guy, he went through all this counting stuff and everything else.  And I listened to this music.  And when you hear this color, this is going to happen.  You hear this color.  But the entire time that this was going on,  I was totally aware of everything that was going on. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  The session is done with.  He's snapping his fingers, counting backwards.  I glanced at my watch, and it was like an hour and a half.  But it only seemed to me like five minutes.  But it didn't work.  Because you're probably nodded off or something.  And the whole thing with hypnotism is a good hypnotist will be able to relax you  to that weird, almost asleep point where you're a little, you know,  you're in that zone where you could nod off, but you're not quite asleep. 
[00:52:00]  So for some reason, they think that you're open to a suggestion more at that level.  I don't believe that either.  But their whole power is that they can bore you to the point where you're almost asleep.  And then when you're almost asleep, you don't feel like you do when you're awake.  So they attribute that to some kind of power that they have.  But no, it's the soft voice, the laying there in a comfortable position.  Yeah, we're doing all that. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, and then they tell you, you know, you don't want a cigarette, you don't want to smoke.  And then if you have enough willpower where you really want to quit, you quit smoking,  and you go, oh, hypnotism made me quit.  Or you keep smoking and go, oh, that was bullshit.  There you go.  By the end of it, they were selling us pills and everything else and trying to rick you into money.  And it was the same as, like, Zyban or something like that.  Okay.  All right, Jim.  All right, punch you out.  Thank you.  Bye.  Chuck Yarla from WhackBag.com.  This is really funny, actually. 
[00:53:00]  Was Anthony saying serious posts only?  Does he want us to attack ourselves?  Is this their way of getting rid of us before we attack them, as they have said they are eventually afraid of?  Turn them on themselves.  That's it.  We understand there's a lot of really good fans on WhackBag.  I think the majority of them, all of them.  Yeah, it is.  But it just seems that a lot of the assholes are allowed to just completely take over,  and that's what's just so frustrating at times.  That's all.  I understand there's a lot of you guys out there that are just great fans on that.  And understand the show, you know, the ins and the outs of this damn thing. 
[00:53:30]  And legitimate criticism is fine.  You get that.  We're not that.  Like, I was talking to some guy who I had a misunderstanding with.  I felt like he was a friend of one of these message boards, who I thought was kind of like for real shit now.  I mean, it's fine if you want to do that.  I mean, it's certainly your right to do it.  But if we know each other, it's like, Jesus, dude.  Yeah.  But we talked in an instant message, and, you know, it was all kind of straightened out.  But he was like, yeah, sometimes you guys don't really take criticism too well.  And it's like, is that true?  I don't know.  I think we do.  I mean, every day.  I think we take it.  Somebody's getting criticized for something on this show. 
[00:54:00]  The moderators over there at Wackbag are pretty good, too.  They wield an iron fist.  If someone's really getting out of line over there, they rein them in and don't take much bullshit.  And Opie and Anthony.net and CringeHumor.com.  No, I don't know about those.  I don't know those boards.  I don't know what they do.  Oh, they always get mad.  Wow fans.  Yeah, Paul Field gets mad.  PostHorse.net.  Psychopath he is.  Does my merchandise.  Church of Opie.  What?  Church of Opie?  What is that?  Something like the Church of Opie.  That's creepy. 
[00:54:30]  Wow, is that an eerie sounding?  I forgot the URL, but it was pretty funny.  What's the Messiah?  Is it a dog on a crucifix?  Pain deliver?  I'll have to try to find it.  A new site that's trying to get some play.  It's called Church of Opie.  It's not ChurchofOpie.com?  I'm not sure, honestly.  I don't know.  Well, who else would have ChurchofOpie.com?  How about, can we get a fucking fan.net?  Is that possible?  Jesus Christ, it's brutal in here.  You know what's funny?  We keep saying it's hot in here, and Eric's got a good observation. 
[00:55:00]  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, how's it going?  This one's from Master Poe.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting very hot in here.  Yeah.  I don't know, dude.  Your line was funnier.  That's on the screen, though.  What was the line?  I didn't want to take it from him.  The guy's like, is Master Poe running in and out all morning long because you guys keep  saying it's hot in there?  Kind of funny.  It's not bad.  Let me check that.  What?  Anyone have deoders?  Oh, you found it?  Yeah, I found it, all right.  Wait, can you get it up on here, Eric?  Are you here today?  Happy birthday, God.  And Opie's tips to beat the movie crowds. 
[00:55:30]  Led Zeppelin, greatest band of all time.  That's why I'm asking if you're here today.  That is a good point, Hawk.  He's asking you.  The Lord considers smoking marijuana.  What does this mean for us?  Since baby wipes placed in church bathroom, worshipers have never felt so fresh.  That's an Anthony thing, though.  Anthony turned me on to the baby wipes.  Grace to you and peace in the name of Opie, our Lord.  What I love is there's a post for my birthday.  Happy birthday, God. 
[00:56:00]  May 23rd is our Lord and Savior's birthday.  Today, the question is posed to our holy scholars.  Why does Opie Day fall on December 25th rather than on his actual birthday?  And then it talks about how old I am?  Yeah.  Oh, you saw that?  That's hysterical.  Where is it?  One of the biggest mysteries is Opie's actual age.  When he is asked, he usually skirts the issue.  How old is God?  And then the answer, the Lord skirts the issue of his age because it is not relevant.  Would you love him any less if he were 90 or 10? 
[00:56:30]  It is of no consequence.  Opie will always remain 25 in our hearts.  Who put this together?  Some sarcastic son of a bitch.  I think he deserves some credit.  It's funny, man.  Led Zeppelin, greatest band of all time.  That's right.  Don't even argue that one with me.  And then in some of the topics in the forums, what is Opie's purpose?  Is he truly immortal?  Did we anger him? 
[00:57:00]  Spiritual debate?  That's funny.  Discuss the holy saints?  I guess.  I guess.  And the topic is, is Norton a better saint than Anthony?  Church of Opie.  It's getting out of hand.  Are you pitting out, Opie?  Oh, look, it's me.  Yeah, you ought to see God sweating like he just backed over an 8-year-old.  You are soaked.  Can someone give me some water?  I never sweat like this. 
[00:57:30]  You're sweating around in the middle of your shirt, too, like where your ribs are.  Dude, I am dying.  Well, you've got a black shirt on.  I'm sure you're just as bad.  Dude, I don't sweat.  Even when I was in the gym yesterday for an hour and a half, I had to sit in the steam room.  Oh, really?  Working out?  It's funny.  You know, I've had foot pain for a month.  And I mean a bad cramp in my right foot.  I'm panicking thinking I have foot cancer.  You know, there's something wrong with me.  Jesus, no.  I get foot cancer.  I know.  I got cancer to prick.  I wound up walking on the treadmill for a half hour yesterday.  It's still a little uncomfortable, but it's 80% better.  I wonder if I had to stretch it out a little bit. 
[00:58:00]  You did.  Yeah, you know how it is when you work out and you go swimming 10 laps, and then you  do a little bit of a...  I was so embarrassed because, like, Regan's dumb bit, I couldn't, like, see what machine  was good for what.  Yeah.  I used the machine backwards and I hurt myself.  I stretched and I pulled something trying to just get the machine so I could exercise.  I'm the two-plate guy.  Clang.  You're working out.  That's...  Dude, I couldn't.  What am I going to do?  I mean, I had to go take a steam, as we say.  Take a steam.  But then my...  Is this normal when you take a steam that the rest of the night my face was oily? 
[00:58:30]  Is that because it brings out oils in your face?  Like, my face is never that oily.  I would think it might do that, but I...  I think you're...  No, it's going on, Jimmy, because you've decided to take on a workout program.  You're going to start sweating out the toxins.  That's what they say.  So, maybe you're sweating out some of the toxins and the oils are kind of coming to  the surface a little bit.  By that, he means the AIDS.  Sweating it out, AIDS.  Just sweat it out.  Like, my breathing's been all off.  I'm all nervous, thinking I've got something with my lungs or emphysema.  Really?  I wonder if it's just tension.  You're a hypochondriac? 
[00:59:00]  I feel like I can't breathe all the time.  Are you?  I don't know.  This started in the playoffs when the Yankees were getting their asses kicked by Boston.  Yeah.  When they couldn't...  When they were, like, winning, like, six...  Remember that last win the Yankees had against Boston?  So long ago.  I had that horrible cold or sore throat or whatever I had.  It was bad.  Yeah.  Where I couldn't leave the house for, like, three days.  Now you feel like your lungs won't fill up with air?  Yeah.  Me and Anthony talked about it.  Anthony's so good at putting...  Like, he takes these symptoms you have.  And he's like, oh, you can't get that click when you're breathing. 
[00:59:30]  Like, that's what it is, the click.  It's that click.  It's not a real click.  But you feel like when you breathe in deep that you've filled your lungs and can exhale.  Sometimes when you breathe in all the way, you don't feel like you've filled your lungs up.  You don't feel that click point.  Yeah.  Even though you're not passing out.  I'm like, am I really breathing and then just panicking because...  Hmm.  Well, working out, huh?  Yeah, a long time.  An hour and a half in a gym.  That's dumb.  Almost two hours.  That's dumb.  Why?  Because that's the biggest mistake a lot of people do when they start working out. 
[01:00:00]  No, I didn't know.  Okay.  Well, most people, though, they finally want to work out, so they got all that motivation.  They go to the gym and they do maybe an hour and a half, two hours.  They do it for the first week and they're so tired and sore that they have to now take two or three weeks off  and then they slowly but surely just don't do it anymore.  The key is to just do it slowly and build up.  I thought of that.  And make it part of your lifestyle.  But the key is I spent a lot of time on the treadmill and a lot of it was in the steam room and in the pool, which was fine. 
[01:00:30]  You know what I mean?  It was kind of like walking on the treadmill, I had my iPod, which I still want to throw out the window  because I fucking think he's turning off.  iPods stink technologically.  They've had a problem with their batteries.  No, dude, on a battery thing, when it's plugged in, it just stops.  Really?  I have to let the battery wear off.  I can't, like, reboot it.  You know how you press menu and the other button?  Nothing happens.  Dude, I've had a bunch of bugs in my iPod.  You're bringing on something that's very...  Makes me sick.  Very interesting.  Apple stinks.  They are buggy.  They definitely have some bugs.  Free Nick or Freak Nick?  Freak Nick. 
[01:01:00]  Free Nick.  F-R-E-N-I-K from Cleveland needs to get credit for Church of Opie.  Oh, really?  He threw everything together, yeah.  But, all right, a couple more things.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  Hey, you're talking about them baby wipes?  Yeah.  My wife managed to get about six of them into crapper in the last week or so, so I get home.  Nothing's working out like it should.  All right, fine.  Pipe's clogged.  Working on that.  Breaks one in the kitchen.  Floods the kitchen.  Floods the hallway.  Floods the dining room. 
[01:01:30]  So my ass feels better except for the part where my wallet rides because I've got to put out a grand on my homeowner's.  How many are you flushing down there at a time?  God damn, I don't know, man.  I'm like one at a time and I come home, she's saying, hey, listen, I don't know what's going on here.  I'm baby wiping once a day.  That's after a dump.  You use one.  You don't use like a whole handful of them.  It is the cure for cranky asthma.  Oh, it is.  It's wonderful.  When you feel like you're making soup in your underwear, you take one of those, it just takes one, like midday, clean up nice. 
[01:02:00]  Even if it's a regular dump.  Really?  It's fine to use the wipe.  It's great.  But on those special occasions where there's a little something going on, maybe it feels like sandpaper coming out of you.  Heated sandpaper.  Heated sandpaper.  That's when they really come in handy.  You almost hear a pfft.  You're walking down the street at some kind of local fair or something and all of a sudden things start bubbling in the back there. 
[01:02:30]  That is the most uncomfortable feeling.  You can't have that.  It's just burning and just so awkward.  And it just, those wipes are amazing.  They just help you out.  I like the wipe thing.  Hawk, do we have an extra daily news?  Just take that one.  No, I don't want to take it.  I know you've got to do things.  Thanks, sweetie.  Well, here's the deal.  So, getting back to the quote, Jimmy.  Who said this over the weekend?  Okay.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge, that's how it says in the paper, by the way, instead of the, and George Washington Bridge is a raft. 
[01:03:00]  But, you can't do that.  Any guesses?  Yankee Stadium is a fruit stand and George Washington.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge is a raft. 
[01:03:30]  You can't do that.  I'm going to guess Voss because it's stupid.  Makes no sense.  What was the quote?  Oh, here's a $1,000 deposit for a car that I haven't even seen in person yet.  Well, now you have to hit me.  That's a very vague thing.  It sounds like a Huck Finn or something referenced, but apparently it's not.  Now, what does this person do?  Do I know this person?  Well, he's in our business, technically.  It's like he's in the radio business.  Proving that this guy should just be spinning records. 
[01:04:00]  That's all he does.  I'm sorry.  That's all this guy does.  Spin records?  Yeah.  And they're making a big deal out of it.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge is a raft.  You can't do that, said the 67-year-old Moro who introduced the Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965.  Cousin Brucie?  Talking about Cousin Brucie, Anthony.  67?  That's a lie.  That guy's in his 70s.  Minimum.  Minimum.  Stop it. 
[01:04:30]  I'm not a big Cousin Brucie fan, to be honest with you.  Now that I know that Cousin Brucie is a line about his age, I'm ready to tell everyone how old I am.  That's right.  I am 34 years old.  And I'm proud of it.  Ooh.  What does that mean?  What did he say about CBS not being there?  Well, it's big news.  How about this?  No one cares if CBS is here.  Exactly.  No one cares.  Let's bring the whole country into this, though.  You know, it's big news here in New York.  And I think it's big news for radio as far as the rest of the country goes.  A lot of these oldies formats are going away fast. 
[01:05:00]  Oldies.  Really fast.  Infinity Broadcasting, our old company, they changed the format here of CBS FM in New York City.  Got rid of the oldies.  And they did it in Chicago as well on Friday.  Yep.  And it's happening in a lot of cities across America.  It might even have happened in your city by now.  And they're replacing it with the Jack format.  Jack.  Oh, the radio industry, a buzz with Jack.  And that's where DJs play music and they whack off live on the air and... 
[01:05:30]  Jack it.  And they jack it.  Jack is jockless, I believe.  Jack is a format.  Basically, it's...  You know how people have their iPods and you throw everything in there.  You throw your Rolling Stones in there.  You throw your U2, the Beastie Boys.  Your Kaja Goo Goo.  Kaja Goo Goo, yeah.  Those guilty pleasures.  Yeah.  And then you hit shuffle on your iPod and you...  Oh!  You never know what's going to come up next.  I know what's coming up.  It's Sympathy for the Devil and the next song is Too Shy Shy.  Right.  Kaja Goo Goo.  And it's exciting because it's just like... 
[01:06:00]  It's unper...  And then Olivia Newton-John's, I honestly love you.  It's unpredictable.  Eclectic.  Eclectic.  It goes from White Stripes to, I don't know, Flack of Seagulls.  What are they finally admitting?  That the program directors and that the playlists are shit and don't know what they're talking about?  Are they finally admitting that?  Is that what this is?  This is radio saying the program directors don't know what they're doing?  Yeah.  In this weird kind of format, I think they're...  They're acknowledging that.  And that they don't want jocks wasting any time. 
[01:06:30]  I got to tell you, I heard the format change, so I switched over there.  Gave it a listen for about an hour, an hour and a half.  And I heard maybe eight, nine songs.  Okay.  An hour and a half.  What was your rest?  An hour and a half?  An hour and a half.  I heard so many commercials, couldn't even deal.  I'm so used to satellite radio now that I go to regular radio.  And usually all I listen to on regular radio is news. 
[01:07:00]  So they don't usually hit you with these huge, long stop sets during news.  It's a couple of commercials and then more news.  So to listen to a regular music station again, I couldn't believe it.  There was one point, I'm listening, I turn it on, and I hop in the shower.  The entire time until I started getting dressed, I didn't hear one song.  Not kidding.  Yeah.  As soon as I got to satellite radio over two and a half years ago now, I barely go back  to commercial radio. 
[01:07:30]  You can't even do it.  You greedy faggots in commercial have ruined it for yourselves.  And people are running away from you.  The more commercials they play, the happier I am because you're pushing people right to  us.  Good.  Yep.  That's exactly what they're doing.  You suck and you're greedy.  Just like with television, you're slaves to the advertisers.  And I understand advertising pays the bills and you've got to have them, but you become  such slaves to it, you push people to an alternative.  Well, this is what I want to say.  This whole Jack format, it's popping up.  It has other names.  Actually, there's a station in Philly called Ben.  No way. 
[01:08:00]  I swear, because there's Ben.  Is there Bob or something, too?  Bob, Dave.  Dave.  Why do they just pull names out of their ass?  I don't know, because that's how creative commercial radio is at this point.  Let's just call it after a very popular name.  Like, I know, Ethel or Fred.  Yeah, Fred.  Yeah, I guess XM's guilty of that, too, a little bit.  Mrs. Trumbull.  Someone in XM programming thought it'd be very clever to have an Ethel station and a Lucy  station.  And a Fred.  Fred.  What about Ricky? 
[01:08:30]  Well, why not just get all of them?  Uh-huh.  Oh, Ricky.  You're listening to Ricky.  Here's Love Shack.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, well, I also went to the New York Radio Message Board when I heard about the CBS  flipping.  Yeah, this is what we're getting at.  Anthony and I actually have a connection to the Jack format.  Jack.  We might have seen the Jack playbook back in the day if he was willing to open it up for  us in that office that day. 
[01:09:00]  What a tool.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Gary Wall.  Well, first of all, I go over to the New York Radio Message Board that radio dentist Alan  Sniffen runs.  There's a bunch of posts about CBS, the demise of CBS, and they're all upset about it.  They are all upset about it, and they were treating it, I swear to you, some of these  posts were like the same posts about 9-11, but instead of like World Trade Center, put  in CBS FM.  People were that busted up about this. 
[01:09:30]  One woman actually posted, this is truly going to be one of those days where you say, I remember  where I was when I heard CBS was off the air.  And hopefully she was discovering she had cancer.  Idiot.  One of the, I read that and just out loud went, ugh.  I couldn't believe someone actually put a radio station changing a format in the same 
[01:10:00]  thing as Kennedy being shot, the Challenger exploding, jets flying into the Trade Center.  I remember where I was when I heard, no you don't.  You won't remember.  You're stupid.  Well, these people, they grew up with the station.  That's the problem.  But, you know, with these listeners, they don't understand that the people that run these  stations, they don't take it as serious as you.  They don't care.  They don't care.  As soon as the ratings drop or something, they're not trying to, you know, really fix  this station.  They're like, ah!  All right, what else is hot out there? 
[01:10:30]  All right, the jack format?  All right, change format immediately.  Fire everyone.  Fire, fire, fire, fire everyone.  Obviously, it's all about selling and making money.  They want to make money.  Radio stations of business has to make money.  With the oldies format, your listeners are old people.  Old people, they're not known for really going out and buying these high-end items.  They're not known for buying things that are advertised a lot, that a lot of advertisers  pay money to radio stations to advertise. 
[01:11:00]  You know?  It just doesn't work.  So you try to get people to listen to a station that are younger and have that buying power.  And I like CBS.  I actually like some of the music they played.  I mean, Cousin Brucie's echo really annoyed me.  I guess that was his thing.  It's all the oldies things.  It was that reverb sound that they used to use way back when, and they just continued  using it.  Yeah, it's so, it's so, ooh.  And dude, I listen to someone, like, I was listening to, it might have been 103.5 or something, 
[01:11:30]  or it was U100, where she hit the post.  And I'm listening to, now, you know, the more you're, like, you're in radio, because  you guys were in a lot longer than me, and, like, I kind of come in and, like,  you start noticing shit.  Yeah.  And that talk they do, that phony, hey, it's my birthday, can you play this?  Like, they called for a request.  I mean, the only thing I ever requested on the radio, this is true, was the record  of the Edmund Fitzgerald years ago on a New Jersey station, 98.3, and they never played it.  You really did?  Absolutely true.  Did you request that song?  Completely true.  And, of course, they didn't play it.  You know, I listened all night.  I didn't know that these faggots were sort of married to a playlist. 
[01:12:00]  They'll say, yeah, yeah, we'll get it on for you.  Well, I mean, requesting a song on the radio is the biggest gag in the business.  All the radio guys laugh about it, because even if you're a station that plays not a  lot of commercials, you're still playing only 10 songs an hour to maybe 12, okay?  Yeah.  12 songs an hour.  You know how many phone calls a DJ gets in one hour for requests?  At a music station?  Hundreds.  The phone is constantly ringing with song requests.  10 lines ringing the entire time you're on the air, so do the math.  Let's say, safely, there's 100 calls an hour, all right? 
[01:12:30]  And you can only play 10 an hour.  Do the math.  When are they going to get to your song?  And if you played every request, there's still 90 people that aren't hearing their request  per hour.  And my job when I was in music is, like, you got your stupid playlist, and let's say  you're playing, I don't know, Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven, you wait for that dope from, I don't  know, North Babylon to request Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven, and then you tape it.  You tape it.  And then you play that right before Stairway to Heaven.  Conveniently, the intro's playing as he's requesting the song. 
[01:13:00]  You'd have the whole hours.  We're all Crescans.  Yeah.  You'd have the whole playlist for your entire show right in front of you.  So you look, it's for some songs, you look through it, and then you realize when a request  comes through that sounds like a cool guy that you would want on the air requesting  that song, you tape it, and then you play it.  That's why sometimes it's like, yeah, you hear the intro to the song start up, and then  you hear the phone call.  Let's go to the phones.  Hey, could you play Led Zeppelin?  Yeah, we're playing it right now. 
[01:13:30]  How about this?  This is why these boars never became famous.  How about playing one request on the air where you're playing something else, and you go,  no, I'm not playing that song.  It sucks, and so do you.  Click, and you play something else.  Right.  How about some kind of balls or originality to make it interesting?  There's nothing like that.  They hit the post.  They talk through the beginning, and I hate that.  I used to wonder, because when you don't know, you would wonder, how did he get the song  on so fast?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like someone requests a song, and you're like, wow, he's got it right there.  Is there a button or something that they can just press with these songs? 
[01:14:00]  See, we're already talking to the converted, people that are fed up with commercial radio.  It's too bad.  I would love to talk to commercial radio fans a little bit more.  Because these guys would get fired if they didn't play their list of songs.  That's the reality of it.  You can't just go, wow, this guy wants to hear, you know, Sunday Bloody Sabbath, Sabbath  Bloody Sabbath.  No, Opie.  Oh.  I know.  Sabbath.  I was thinking on you, too.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  He would get fired if he played that on the air.  You know how I've gotten a request on the air? 
[01:14:30]  I called Eddie Trunk when he was doing it.  A, because, you know, I was on O&A, so they took the call.  But B, because he plays stuff that's no playlist.  Yeah.  I mean, if you like hard rock, Eddie Trunk is the show to listen to, because he always  plays that shit, whatever you want.  I think that Boneyard would probably do that.  Any of these stations that aren't slaves to a playlist.  Ben has run in with a communique.  Uh-oh.  Urgent communique.  From Elo.  I guess he's back from vacation.  We haven't heard from him in, like, 10 days or something.  From Eric Logan to Ben Sparks.  Subject, oldies alive on XM.  Oldies alive on XM. 
[01:15:00]  Tune into the 60s channel.  Right.  Well, they have 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  Yeah, they're basically doing this format that is, you know, being taken away from all  these cities on XM.  Yeah, it's the 60s channel, the 50s channel.  Yeah, but Elo, CBS also played stuff from the 70s and the 80s.  They were sneaking into the early 80s, right?  Yeah, they were, like, doing that whole thing.  So you can't just replace CBS with just the 60s music. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  Hey, I got my cock out.  They would always come back with things that made absolutely no sense.  Like, I guess in the old days, they used to be able to talk it up.  But now they got so old, like Cousin Brucie and everything, I wouldn't understand what  they were saying.  I'd be driving, listening, going, what is he talking about?  Right.  Well, it sounded like he was doing a show from a gymnasium with the echo. 
[01:16:00]  The big, booming echo.  That stunk, that echo.  It was not, it made it unlistenable.  Yeah.  That's what they do with the oldies format.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie, Cousin Brucie.  And as we said, the 60s, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee.  Testing.  Everybody who loved the 60s, say, baby, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee. 
[01:16:30]  Shut up!  I apologize.  I thought that was a song he was talking over.  It was his own jingle.  His own stupid jingle.  I take that back.  We want to have jingles on our show.  You know, that might be the next thing we could give to the listeners to do. 
[01:17:00]  Jingles?  Come up with jingles for the Opie and Anthony show.  Because we're trying to get some of these professional jingle companies to do some goofy jingles for us,  and so far we're having no luck because they take their jobs very seriously.  Jingles are awful, by the way.  They're terrible on commercial radio.  How could you think that's good radio?  It's 101.  It sounds all happy and festive.  It's awful.  You think the listeners have what it takes to maybe come up with some jingles?  No.  Not at all.  No?  You want some Peterson songs?  Yes, they do.  Can we have a rate?  As far as a jingle? 
[01:17:30]  No, I don't mean jingles where we would sit around and be all proud.  Like, wow.  I mean, you know.  You mean like, I'm a sin in the morning.  Yeah, well, just go with the jingles that you've heard on commercial radio forever,  and then rework them to fit the Opie and Anthony show in our twisted way.  It's very hard to come up with to make it sound like a real jingle.  You need that high-energy music, and then the vocals with the harmonies.  The voice has to sound very specific.  You need that jingle-sounding voice. 
[01:18:00]  They're hard to do.  And it's hard to rhyme with Opie and Anthony.  So just so the listeners know, you could also rhyme with Norton and friends.  Right.  Just saying, because ends, bends, trends.  You know what?  We'll just throw it out there and see what happens.  Pray ends.  Maybe it'll be one of those bits that takes on a life of its own,  or maybe it'll just be thrown into the stink pile.  It'll be nothing.  Why is it with Steve's pants?  Like, he's got the pants that kind of like, they all kind of bunch up in his ass crack.  I don't know why I noticed it.  I just can't help.  Dude, because we're all sweating to death.  It is really hot in here. 
[01:18:30]  I am talking as fast as I can, because I think if I stop talking, I'm going to pass out.  Pass out.  You are really sweating.  You're not sweating at all?  You know what it is?  Your headphone cord is hitting your shirt right there, and it's soaking.  How are you not sweating?  You have two shirts.  You look like Adrian Cronauer.  You really do.  Adrian Cronauer.  He's in Vietnam, but he's on vacation.  What?  Anthony has got the regular t-shirt, a darker t-shirt, and what is that? 
[01:19:00]  It's a long, a short-sleeve button-down.  It's kind of like one of those Bahama, actually.  What are those shirts called?  There's a name, Bahama Gym, or...  It's like a Bahama kind of thing.  You're a fancy man.  Yeah, that's me.  I'm fancy.  No, you know what it is?  The t-shirt under it is to soak up the sweat.  Are you sweating?  Are you sweating?  I think I am.  Hold on one second.  Ah, CBS FM. 
[01:19:30]  A couple of minutes past 11 o'clock in the city.  With the greatest hits of all time, this is Ron Lundy.  Hello, it's me.  This is Ron Lundy, and...  That's not good radio, by the way.  When you talk up until the...  If you shut your mouth and hit the beginning of the song,  I can't tell you, that is a knife in my stomach when I do that.  It's not the oldie's way.  You must talk until they start singing.  When Lundy said hit the post, like, you're the first one I ever heard that expression from, 
[01:20:00]  and I realized there was a saying for it.  There was a saying for it.  I wanted to bite people for it.  Bite their face.  Like you time it out and stop talking now.  Lyrics, lyrics, lyrics.  And they're very proud of being able to hit the post like that.  They should be ashamed and embarrassed to do it.  All right.  See, Bia.  Let's go to Dean in New Jersey.  Dean, what's up?  Oh, how you doing?  I don't know if you can, but it would be great if you guys could replay that old bit  where Ant tooled on that DJ from CBS who ranked on you guys.  He tooled on it for about 10 minutes. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  I remember that bit.  We might have that around.  That was great.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah.  Back to you, Swamplet.  Back to you, Swamplet.  I don't get the swamp thing.  No?  Less stress in my life.  I'm not swapping these days.  Is that what it is?  Less stress?  You know that.  I have so much less stress in my life.  No, I don't mean you have less stress.  I mean, is it the lack of stress?  Yeah, those are brought on by stress.  Yeah, they're mostly brought on by stress.  Really?  Yeah.  I think stress really wrecks your body, man.  It really does.  It's possible.  You know what?  We could probably find that old CBS bit. 
[01:21:00]  It's a great story.  I don't know.  We were always getting in trouble, and the gang at CBS, they took some shots at Anthony  and I basically saying, I think they said something like monkeys could do our jobs  or something.  Ooh.  I've cloned some monkeys.  Bob Shannon said they had to clone some monkeys so you guys could take vacation.  Enough.  Eric, shut up.  Jesus Christ.  It's an endless babble fest with you.  We've heard it.  Opie said it already.  Monkeys.  Monkeys.  They just reiterate everything, he says.  Yeah, why don't you just comment on a Vietnam guy that Anthony might look like now while 
[01:21:30]  you're at it?  Who does he look like?  Adrian Hill from Rocky?  No.  Pipe up when you have something.  Yeah, but the guys basically said they could clone us so we could go on vacation or something  like that, and they took their little shot.  It was like a five-second shot they took, and then we ended up killing them for like an  hour and a half on our show that day.  Danny, what's up?  They said the same thing after the tsunami song.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Yes, sir.  You're on the air, sir.  I'm on the air.  Yes. 
[01:22:00]  Not anymore.  Come on, guys.  What was that?  Is that a bit he was doing?  I'm shocked to be on the air, guy?  I'm on the air.  Be prepared to do what you want to do when we go to you.  Help us out a little bit here.  All right.  We could play that CBS bit.  No problem, actually.  Yeah?  You got it?  It's a big day for oldies radio, and yeah, we had some fun tooling on that whole format.  Coming up with all the dumb names and stuff.  Right.  Remember?  They never have their real names.  They have to have radio names. 
[01:22:30]  We went through this.  They wanted me to change my name when we got to WAF.  Because they didn't think Opie and Anthony was something that sounded good or rolled off  the tongue.  Oh, my God.  It doesn't, because it's like Opie and M. Anthony and me.  Opie and Anthony, and it sounds like Opie and this.  Opie and Anthony and me.  People can't say it.  But when we got to AAF, Dave Dickless, our program director, in his infinite wisdom, thought  it would be better.  And I think even Bruce E. Mittman it was.  Yeah.  Bruce E. Mittman said that it would be better if I had like a weird name instead of just 
[01:23:00]  Anthony.  I forgot all about this.  Like Opie and maybe something that even rhymed with Opie or something like, yeah, yeah.  Or it's something like, you know, any kind of weird name.  And by the way, because people, this comes up from time to time, I'm embarrassed by my  name.  I got it when I was 12.  It's not a radio name.  But now, unfortunately, I was starting to think about just going back to my real name,  Greg Hughes.  Yeah.  You know, and all of a sudden, it and I hit. 
[01:23:30]  So now I'm stuck being Opie for the rest of my life.  Because it can't be, well, at least as long as we're doing a show.  Right.  You can probably change after that.  But it's not a wacky show.  This is Greg Hughes with your current events.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Dateline.  Yeah.  You know, then you can switch.  You don't have a wacky show.  If you had an Opie in a show and it was like madcap and zany, but you know, you throw  poker chips at fat girls.  Yeah.  They're really, you're basically a vicious prick.  So Opie is okay.  It's not a cute, it's not a cute hand-holding thing.  I think the name softens my viciousness. 
[01:24:00]  No.  No, it doesn't.  No one thinks of that when you're humiliating them.  Well, at least he has a cute name.  Who's the fat pig outside the studio?  Aw.  But his name is Opie.  Yeah, so, aw, that's cute.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wanted something like Opie and, like Opie and Porkchop or, you know, not even a  real name, like something.  Opie and the seagull.  Opie and, you know, like.  Oh, I wish you were the seagull.  Oh, please.  Ah, ah.  I wish, you know.  I wish we could remember the name.  Opie and the seagull. 
[01:24:30]  Opie and the seagull.  Opie and the snowman.  Yeah, something just, I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was on those lines where  it wasn't a name, like, you know, Opie and Mike.  Change your name to Mike.  Right, right, right.  You know, it was Opie and then a something.  Well, I'm sure the listeners will be filling in the blank all morning now.  Oh, sure they will.  Well, and I'm sure the photoshops will kick in and.  Oh, I mean.  Yeah.  Opie and Howard Hughes.  Opie and Bubble Boy.  Yeah, they wanted, like, a weird name for me.  You know why? 
[01:25:00]  They absolutely had no clue what my role was to be on the show.  They couldn't fathom that I hadn't gone to school for radio.  I never did radio, so I was going to sit and do radio with you.  They thought it was going to be Opie's show and me as, like, the street stunt boy kind  of thing.  That's what always frustrates me about this show is, like, people don't understand what  all our roles are, okay?  Yeah.  There was a point when Anthony and I went to WAF within a week, maybe two weeks tops.  This story's been told many times, because I was the, quote, radio guy. 
[01:25:30]  I went to college, did college radio, and by the time I met Anthony, I was easily doing  ten years of radio, maybe more.  And the program director actually corners me in the little luncheon area while I'm getting  coffee for our afternoon drive show, and he was trying this divide and conquer with Anthony  and I, and basically trying to have this smooth conversation with me, going, so why Anthony?  Like, he didn't get it.  He didn't get it because, you know, Anthony didn't have this resume with a ton of radio 
[01:26:00]  stations under his name, because that's how you hire somebody in this business, if you're  a tool and have no fucking, you know, creativity whatsoever.  No creativity.  What the hell is that?  No originality.  Well, the doors are open, so now we're hearing one of those.  One of those, you left the phone off the hook signals.  So basically, Dave was trying to see if I was open to the idea, this is what I think,  of replacing Anthony, or maybe even just getting rid of him and just having me, you know, spin  tunes.  No, I think his idea was, since he didn't hire us, it was get rid of me and do one of those 
[01:26:30]  wacky things he did with Rocco, where, hey, win a chance to be Opie's sidekick.  If you're a ticket number, blah, blah, blah, sitting at Fenway, you will win.  And meanwhile, they have a guy lined up already.  It's one of his guys.  Honestly, he didn't get personality radio, so what I think was in his mind, I think he  wanted me, you know, because it was all about the music.  He wanted me to go on and, you know, maybe take a few wacky phone calls and just play, 
[01:27:00]  you know, mostly music.  I can't stand that bastard.  Oh, God.  I cannot stand him.  Isn't he wasting away in the Midwest somewhere?  No, I think he's back in Massachusetts.  What is he?  I don't remember.  He's doing some friggin' ticker station, a stock ticker station.  I think they hired him for a business station and then, I don't know, whatever.  Good luck to you.  Radio's a rough gig, man.  It seems like, I mean, I kind of stepped in shit here.  Every radio guy in the country should want to spit in my face because of what I walked  into, which was a hit show. 
[01:27:30]  I just kind of traipsed into a hit show.  Yeah, well.  Most guys look at the L.A.  I skipped in and everything was in place.  Opie and the Wrangler.  Opie and the Wrangler's coming in.  Oh, that's good.  Opie and Dopey.  Opie and the N-Hater.  Fleabite and Tinbender Show.  Opie and Fred.  Opie and the HVAC guy.  How about Opie and the Tinknocker?  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, you know what?  Knowing the good old Brucey Mittman, that would have been one. 
[01:28:00]  That would have been one.  Opie and the Tinknocker.  I like Opie and the Tinknocker.  It would appeal to the blue boys.  To the blue color.  B-b-b-boys.  Yeah.  Anthony's just a regular guy.  The Tinknocker.  Let's make believe that he's only doing radio in his part-time.  His full-time job is installing AC units.  Yeah, and I can talk when I come on the air because we were doing afternoons.  I can talk about how I already put in a whole morning's work.  Maybe you don't even have time to actually leave your job.  So, you know, just before we play that Alice in Chains song, you hear Anthony hammering 
[01:28:30]  in the background.  I'm hammering away on some sheet metal.  Do AC guys hammer?  I don't even know.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we hammer on sheet metal sometimes to make it fit.  On metal and stuff.  Sometimes those shop guys don't measure right, Opie.  You've got to get the old duct stretcher out.  Bend that thing up a little bit.  Wait a minute.  You're an air conditioning guy.  How about a little help today?  You could probably fix this.  Yeah.  What the fuck, Anthony?  Call the guy.  That would be like us having prostitute problems and me just sitting here doing nothing.  Exactly.  Wait a minute.  You bring up a good point.  There's a guy for that. 
[01:29:00]  Call him because it ain't me.  I know that.  I threw my tools on the Mass Pike when I first drove up to Massachusetts.  Maybe somebody can give Anthony a wooden hanger for his shirt and he can check things  out.  A wooden hanger.  One that doesn't stretch out the fancy material.  The shoulders don't get pointy.  You know what you've got to tell?  I mean, we're going really long here, so maybe a little later today.  You've got to tell a story about how you just abandoned your car and said, ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, when it blew up.  Yeah.  And then you never went and got it.  I didn't get it. 
[01:29:30]  Why?  I was done.  It was the first new car I bought after that.  After that one blew up, it was the first new car.  Didn't you scrape off some serial numbers, take the license plates and just...  I didn't even scrape off because they don't care.  I took the Reggie.  I scraped the Reggie off the window, took the plates.  Quick story.  You were coming back from Boston.  You were coming back from Boston.  I was right around the Maronek, New York.  And I started noticing a ticking sound in the engine of my Dodge Ares K car, my 1985 Dodge  Ares K.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I was sporting back then. 
[01:30:00]  And I noticed it ticking, but it had always ticked, you know?  And so I turned the radio a little louder.  And I'm hearing the ticking just a little louder.  And I'm like, right when I said, I don't remember it ticking this loudly, every light, I swear  to God, it was like the command module of Apollo 13.  Every light on the dash went, like alarms went off.  Every single light.  You know when you start your car, every light test, they were all on. 
[01:30:30]  Everything.  And I'm like, oh, this isn't good.  And the engine just made this explosion sound.  And it was over.  It was done.  The car just, poof, died.  So I got onto the off-ramp in the Maronek.  Almost made it off the ramp, which would have helped me out, because then I could have called  a certain tow truck to pick me up.  But since it was on the ramp of the thruway, you have to call special parkway, New York 
[01:31:00]  State tow truck things.  Like, there's this whole rule.  If the car would have rolled another 50 feet, I probably would have kept it for a while  more.  But I didn't know who to call or anything, so I just said, you know something?  I need a new car.  Yeah.  Took the plates off of it, scraped the Reggie off.  And if you're trapped somewhere, and you can't afford a rental car, because they're too  expensive, get a 1990, for $19.95, I was able to get a U-Haul.  You rent a U-Haul, and you don't even have to bring it back. 
[01:31:30]  You just leave it wherever the hell the next U-Haul thing is.  And I bought a car.  But yeah, that was what I was driving, back and forth from New York to Boston for quite  a while.  That piece of shit.  That's why I enjoy having a few things these days, Opie.  I understand, Anthony.  I know where you came from.  I really...  I saw the car on blocks in your front yard.  That would eventually be that car that would break down.  It was on blocks.  About a year later or so.  Opie comes over and goes, what are you going to do for driving around in Boston? 
[01:32:00]  And I point it.  I go, the Dodge.  He goes, but it's on blocks.  I'll take care of that.  Yeah.  I'm on it.  Yeah.  I got a couple of tires.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, I'm distracted.  It was a mess.  I'm watching Cedric the Entertainer just pulled up in an old-fashioned bus to do his interview  on the...  It's weird to see Mike Epps.  David Jr., even Elvis.  Elvis was in there.  And Sammy, all in one...  No, no.  Not all in the same way.  Ralph Crandon and the new Black Honeymooners.  And I'm calling it the Black Honeymooners.  It was a small thing when Peggy nipped him once. 
[01:32:30]  You know what?  I can't even...  It's weird to see Epps because Epps is actually a really, really funny, completely black room  comic.  He's not some selling cutesy comic at all.  He's a funny bastard.  And he's doing all these, like, Friday's movies.  And it's like, it's just weird to see him on the Today Show because he's a pretty hardcore...  The Black Honeymooners.  It's going to have nothing to do with the original.  Why not just call the movie something else?  Call it something else.  How about the common law marriages?  Jesus.  Call it the Black Bus Driver.  Call it...  Call it the Black Bus Driver. 
[01:33:00]  Jesus.  Call it Black Guy Gets to Sit Up Front.  I don't know.  Just don't call it the...  Just don't call it the Honeymooners.  Why does Al Roker have to introduce the stunt bus driver?  Jesus.  That's who he is.  He's the stunt bus driver for the Honeymooners.  He's the stunt bus driver.  He looks like Cedric.  I mean, or similar to Cedric.  He does, definitely.  He was the stunt bus driver for the Honeymooners.  Whatever.  All right.  So let's get back to the CBS thing.  That's where we were.  And that's where we're going to end.  Because they did find the old CBS bit. 
[01:33:30]  And we could have fun playing that and take a little long break and get some food.  And the AC kicked in.  So give the room a...  Did it kick in?  Yeah.  And I swear to God, I need a shower or something.  See, I fixed it.  Eric, what was wrong with it?  I think this will work out fine.  Because this CBS bit is classic.  It really is.  It'll give us a chance to regroup and let the AC kick in.  But basically, so CBS went away.  The only station here in New York.  And Cousin Bruce, he's a legend pretty much in his own mind, actually.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden, Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand 
[01:34:00]  and George Washington Bridges a raft.  You can't do that, said the 67-year-old Morrow, who introduced the Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965.  The Brooklyn-born Radio Hall of Famer said, a couple slide rules and the pocketbook were  all that were considered when his bosses pulled the switcheroo with little notice to him or the  legion of listeners who dig oldies music.  I got a certain amount of understanding for what he's saying and almost a certain amount  of respect for it.  Because this is a guy who I'm not a fan of, but I mean, he did introduce the Beatles at 
[01:34:30]  Shea Stadium.  This is like a real guy and these scumbags just want to make a few extra dollars.  I know it's wrong, but I kind of feel for him.  But everyone who does radio understands the game.  That's how it works.  This guy actually thinks the bosses cared about him.  They don't.  And they should have said, like, we're changing formats in a week.  Here's a big, haunting, stunning tribute to CBS FM.  They don't care.  The jocks and everything.  No.  They just want to move on.  They want to hose down the place and start making, you know, more money than they could  with the old former.  That's the reality of it. 
[01:35:00]  As far as XM goes, we're hot right now.  We're really hot.  Okay.  But as soon as we start sucking or whatever, XM will show us the door in a second with  no tribute or gold watch or anything.  We're out the door.  That's how it works.  No gold watch?  Nothing.  You know, these radio guys, I think they're really important.  None of us are.  We're all replaceable.  You think?  When we got fired, we were on top of the world.  I mean, I know people are sick of hearing this, but we were syndicated close to 20 cities,  and in most of them, we were huge. 
[01:35:30]  Absolutely huge.  There was an uproar for maybe a week.  Maybe a week.  And then people went, ah, that's too bad.  Ah, I'm going to find something else to listen to.  Right.  You know?  I know a lot of the radio stations we were on lost a shitload of money, but it didn't  destroy them.  It didn't destroy them at all.  It makes us chuckle when we see the numbers of how many millions they lost, but the reality  is they were able to stay in business.  Yeah.  You know, they didn't have to, well, some of them had to, you know, change formats and  things like that.  But the company wasn't a corporation.  Right. 
[01:36:00]  Anyway, the Brooklyn Born Radio Hall of Famer said a couple slide rules in the pocketbook.  Well, all that were considered.  Well, yeah, that's what happens.  Yeah, that's what the radio stations are there for, you dummies.  This is where he's delusional.  When they did this, they created havoc.  No one cares.  No one.  The ratings were in the toilet.  That's why they did it.  If the ratings were good, they would have never had to go to the jack format.  By the way, I think it is a good move for infinity.  I really do.  I think they'll get some numbers.  They'll get some numbers there.  And then finally he says, I'm running away just for a couple of days, just to clear my 
[01:36:30]  head.  I'll have an announcement.  I'll clear your head of that wig.  I'll have an announcement very soon.  Do you have a rat on his head?  I don't know what he looks like.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Let me see Hawk.  Here it is.  Hawk is good.  He's a seven-year-old guy with the worst toupee.  He says he's 67, but you've got to add at least five onto that, I think.  At least.  Jesus.  He's been wearing that.  He was fat.  We actually met him, and he was cool.  We met him at that Beatles thing.  Yeah, we met him.  He was all right.  And then he talks in the third person in this article, Anthony. 
[01:37:00]  He says, Cousin Brucie cannot sit down.  I'm always dancing.  I'm always moving.  I am the music.  Awful.  So without further ado, I guess this will be our tribute to CBS FM.  Goodbye.  It's a classic ONA bit.  We'll go to this, and we'll continue.  Well, you're going to hear more great radio, basically.  And I can't wait.  This isn't a commercial.  This is more of a show content.  I can't wait to hear the people, bitch, that have heard this before. 
[01:37:30]  Talk.  I can't wait.  Because they're so self-centered, they only think that they're the only ones listening,  instead of, you know, the four million people that are subscribed to XM, any one of them  that have never heard this before.  Deal with it, ass.  Go to Fred.  Go to Ethel.  Go to Lucy.  Oh, wow.  This is a good...  God, I...  The phone calls keep coming in, Ben.  Ben's panicking.  He wants us to break.  Lenny, what's up?  She looks good.  Hey, I want to know if Cousin Brucie found his wife dead on the floor while vacuuming. 
[01:38:00]  Watch out, guys.  It's our favorite thing whenever an old guy gets fired.  The askew shoe.  That was the greatest part of it, was the shoe a little off.  Of course, it was the shoe a little off.  Because Cousin Brucie is talking to that young go-getter jock as he's cleaning out his office.  Don't go off on another tangent.  We've got to take a break.  Can I just say that Peggy Lipton from the Mod Squad is on TV and she's writing a book  and she looks five years older than she did in 1978.  Yeah, what's up with Peggy Lipton looking good?  She looks amazing.  She's unbelievable.  Wow, does she look... 
[01:38:30]  It looks like she looks like the picture behind her.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Remember that?  How great was Clarence Williams III?  Oh my god, he was scary.  Do you ever see, before we go, do you ever see 52 pick up with Roy Scheider and Anne Margaret?  Oh, many years ago.  It's a great movie where they're blackmailing Roy Scheider because they kill this girl.  He's banging.  This young girl he's having an affair with on screen.  They film it and they plant the gun at his house.  And Clarence Williams is one of the guys who's blackmailing him and he tries to smother  vanity with a pillow.  He's just the greatest.  He's Link?  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, Link from the Mod Squad.  Alright, Ant.  Why don't we, I love you.  I was going to do a whole about Schmir with Cousin Brucey, but as he packs up his office.  Cousins?  Alright.  Let's do the CBS thing.  Talking about the Echo and the wacky names and talking right up to the post of the songs.  Right.  This is an 0-1-8 classic.  Check it out.  Matt, what's going on?  Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101.  Why? 
[01:39:30]  Because he was just ripping you guys up and he said that they were in the newspaper that  they just cloned him to Monkees.  Uh-huh.  Because now that you guys, now they have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys should take  a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody's talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  Alright, guys.  Later.  Thank you.  On CBS?  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  That's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where the old jocks go to die.  Hello, love! 
[01:40:00]  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just the music station?  Don't they have like strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it  is out, and go to the next Shirelle song or something.  Hey, Donald, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Alright.  I was just listening to CBS.  My uncle had it on.  He said that they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And he said Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though.  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you. 
[01:40:30]  You've got to give them something, because that's a pretty funny line.  It's a funny line, but if you're going to try to get to us, you've got to come up  with something a little bit more than that.  CBS have fun!  Hey!  Hello!  Look, they cloned a couple of monkeys.  It looks like Opie and Anthony could be taken to vacation.  Hey, get some CBS music.  We'll do it how they did it, probably in between records, because they only get like 15 seconds  to do their shtick, Anthony, you know?  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like they do over there.  I wish we had the echo. 
[01:41:00]  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're playing basketball in the gym and doing a radio show at the same  time?  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love!  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that.  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business.  All right, Ant, you want to be the CBS FM DJ?  What song is it?  Dissing us, Joy to the World.  Oh, yeah?  Guess you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony.  Okay, I'll try.  Hey, CBS FM! 
[01:41:30]  It's Terry Balls here!  Oh, this is a short intro.  Yeah, I need a long intro.  You need a much longer intro than that, right?  I can't say who I am, the station, and rag us.  Yeah, we got to...  How about a little, uh...  Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM.  You know, I'm reading they cloned a couple of monkeys and the music's coming in now.  We don't have enough time.  We got one?  Gotta have a long intro.  No, no, we needed like 15 seconds. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, everybody!  Harry Snatch with you, CBS FM.  I'm reading in the paper today that they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony are going to be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies!  Blonde, cold woman in a black dress.  This one taking you right back to September 1972.  Yeah, that's not bad, man.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble.  All right, well, you want to do like a little, uh, weather break? 
[01:42:30]  Do a quick, quick weather break.  You don't have much time here.  Ready?  Hey, Harry Snatch with you.  Gonna be a little cold today.  Make sure you put on your sweater, CBS FM.  Hey, girl, what you doing down?  Ho, ho!  You're gonna be freezing.  Your testicles are gonna be sticking to your ass crack.  I've lost my friggin' mind working here at CBS FM.  Ho, ho! 
[01:43:00]  How you doing, people?  Remember, it's really cold outside, so, uh, put on a sweater, or you'll end up brain  damage like Opie and Anthony.  Look, I'm talking over the music.  I'm gonna get fired.  Ha, ha, ha!  Miss Taberain Man!  Miss Taberain Man!  I like the Shatner version better.  CBS FM!  All right, you're getting better as we go along here.

Well, then she could be down.  You don't even get a chance there.  Oh, that one, you know.  Here, try this one. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, everybody!  Harry Sack with ya on CBS FM.  You know, they cloned a couple of monkeys, and I can't talk about it because the music  started.  I wish I was over at N.E.W.

This one, going back to 1961, the lion sleeps tonight.  The tokens.  Lion wouldn't be sleeping if I were there.  I'm into bestiality.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  CBS FM.  Oh, brother. 
[02:04:00]  So there you have it.  CBS FM.  They make fun of us with one lousy line, and we just did about an hour on them.  Yeah.  Thank you for giving us an hour of material.  Let's do it.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let it roll, baby, roll.  Let it roll, baby, roll. 
[02:04:30]  Let it roll, baby, roll.  Let it roll.  Oh, let it roll.  80s, right?  88?  Ah.  We're back with the O.N.A. Show.  We got Drew from FARC.com.  He's been hanging outside the studio.  We got to get him in.  It's finally cooling here.  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  Pitcher drying off.  Oh, that is nice.  I got to get some of that.  Phenomenal.  Right guard.  Right guard, but it's a new can and everything.  It looks like it's got twaddle hanging off the side of it. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's got a little thing on the side.  You push down, and the goodness goes right up into your armpit.  Yeah.  The Polar Blast, Cool Spray, right guard, right guard, right guard, Jesus.  Yo, right guard.  Right guard.  I'm all going.  You'll have my herd in.  Yo, bam, bam.  Right guard.  Right guard.  Get out the core.  Get out the motherfucking core.  Anyway, we just noticed you left the studio during the break there.  Yeah, I was checking some email.  I'm having a little bit of computer problems. 
[02:05:30]  And we kind of took a peek.  You know, you write little notes for yourself every day,  and I saw down on your little list of things you want to talk about.  You talked about your iPod experience, and you were working out,  and it says that you had a Steven Tyler dream.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I had more nightmares last night.  Push you down the stairs and then cuddle you like the numbers of KISS.  No.  That was actually an awake fantasy I used to have.  I tossed against.  I went to bed at 2 because I slept late this week.  It's Sunday.  I did the same damn thing, and it screwed me up. 
[02:06:00]  I slept so late yesterday that it's like midnight last night,  and I'm awake.  I'm awake at midnight.  Hello.  How could you guys sleep when it's like 88 degrees out?  It's central air conditioning.  I know, but I feel like I have to be outside doing something.  I went for a walk in that little park nearby, too.  A nice walk in the park yesterday.  Down by the river.  Healthy walk in the park, meeting a fellow behind a bush.  I found my trainee. 
[02:06:30]  You just hear from a bush.  Going to meet people.  Hey, you.  And I'm walking going, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  As you get closer to the bush.  That bike path rocks, though, doesn't it?  Yeah, I don't have a bike.  I should get one.  I'm all about exercise.  I don't know about you guys.  Look at you now.  I can't help it.  I got good energy.  I had a little pep in my step this morning.  Old Freddy fit as a fiddle.  We'll call you.  The soreness is going to kick in tomorrow, Anthony.  Watch how sore he is tomorrow.  He'll be like, I can't move. 
[02:07:00]  So what happened with you and Steven Tyler?  I vaguely remember it.  I was having horrible.  I had to wake myself up.  I had to go, you're not awake.  I actually thought of what we talked about in the studio.  Really?  You think you're awake, but you're actually not.  And I'm like, you're not awake yet.  Shake.  Because I thought I was awake, and I could hear my clip-clop on the floor.  And I went to hit the light, and I realized, oh, this is not my new apartment.  This is my old apartment.  You're not awake yet.  So you're not awake.  That's kind of cool when you kind of know you're dreaming.  But it was scarier because anything could happen.  Like, I have the awareness of an awake person, but I'm in a dream, so anything can happen. 
[02:07:30]  And Steven Tyler was trying to kill me.  I don't know why.  I don't know what this connection is with the lead singer of Aerosmith trying to hurt me.  Ah, there he is.  Why would he try to hurt you?  I don't know.  I was dreaming on.  LOL.  I don't know what it was, but I just remember it was his face behind me, and he was trying to kill me.  How was he trying to choke you or stab you?  I don't remember.  He was stalking me in a dark area. 
[02:08:00]  I don't remember the details.  It was just him.  I think a friend of mine yesterday said she bad-mouthed Steven Tyler, and he overheard her.  Yeah.  He was behind her, so that's probably what sparked the Steven Tyler rock.  Instead of choking you with those scarves that hang off his microphone.  Yeah.  I was really scared in 1987 of those.  Boo.  All right.  Boo.  Dream on.  Dream on, Jimmy.  Let's shoot this fucker. 
[02:08:30]  Fucker.  Fuck Boris Karloff.  Steven Tyler was a man with big lips.  He'd probably have trouble walking through rooms.  It's perfect.  You guys want to say hi to Drew Curtis?  He's been sitting out there for two hours.  Poor Drew.  Yeah.  Let's bring Drew from Fark.com.  From DrewCurtis's Fark.com.  You know what?  This just hit the wire.  Ooh.  Remember our old pal, Pat O'Brien?  Yeah.  To all the ships at sea.  Yeah.  Remember Pat O'Brien?  Who could forget?  Please let him know.  If you remember Pat O'Brien, just blink. 
[02:09:00]  And the phone sex tapes and all that.  Well, this is what happens when you get all that controversy coming your way.  Uh-oh.  O'Brien, 57, will throw out the first pitch at a Canarsie, I was going to say.  Canaries game Saturday.  Canaries?  Where is this?  Oh, the actual Canaries?  That would be interesting.  Canaries playing ball.  Such a mob stool pigeon.  He's going to South Dakota to throw out the first pitch at some kind of minor league baseball  game?  South Dakota.  A minor league baseball game.  Minor league baseball.  However, this is the key. 
[02:09:30]  The team is giving away bobblehead dolls in his likeness.  Why?  Me, you, Betsy, the bobblehead doll.  Some Canaries.  Oh, look at the TV.  Oh, gee.  Live on the Today Show, there's some genetic disaster.  Oh, poor kid.  Are changing the lives of some pretty special kids.  It's a place where we celebrate ability, not disability.  Some fun children, others come just for the fun. 
[02:10:00]  Alicia De Noon is in remission now.  She had a brain tumor when she was three.  All right, you know what?  I'm turning off the audio.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't even want to be tempted.  Why?  She's in remission.  That's good.  I don't even want to be tempted.  The cute girl is petting a dolphin down there in Florida.  Got a better brain tumor.  God bless her.  Let her be.  Look at that little swimsuit on her.  Thanks, Mom, for that nice genetic handoff.  A brain tumor at three.  Yeah, here you go.  Can't be hard, but yeah, must have been my smoking, Mom.  Let that three-year-old get a brain tumor front. 
[02:10:30]  For Mom doing dope.  Nice smile.  Here's a softball on your brain stem, kid.  Get headaches until you're 40.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, it is cruel, and there is no God, and I don't want to hear an argument about it.  Yeah, what did this kid do to deserve a softball tumor?  A brain tumor.  Brain tumor.  In her little head.  And now she gets to pet a dolphin.  Swim with the dolphin, hits him with that bottlenose right in the tumor.  The dolphin, like, goes, can smell the sickness. 
[02:11:00]  Swim with the dolphin noises they make.  Tries to beach the kid and kill it.  Yeah.  So it doesn't...  Yeah.  I smell the sickness on you.  We must beach you.  The kid has no clue that she's...  I beach you.  There's a ring around the head or whatever that she is called.  The yeast dolphin.  She's not sure if she's petting a dolphin or a goat.  Take it to a petting zoo, for God's sake. 
[02:11:30]  Mommy, why is the goat in water?  Shh.  It's all right, puttin' head.  It's a dolphin.  Puttin' head.  Oh, is that horrible puttin' head?  I see the awful, terrible things in my life, and turn it into something funny.  Very good.  Ah.  Ah.  Children and their families that need it, though.  Fifteen years later, Dina's Island Dolphin Care is the largest non-profit program of its kind. 
[02:12:00]  Recently, they moved into a $2 million facility.  Oh, nice.  A museum of sorts.  And take pride in the world.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  That was a nice picture.  It would be funny if you get a little shirt for the kids.  I went to the dolphin farm, and all I got was this lousy gene pool.  There you go.  I want to swim with the dolphin.  Okay, dear.  Be back later. 
[02:12:30]  Be back later.  Why do dolphins get pegged with these jobs these days?  You think the dolphin's sitting there like, oh, Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Why can't it be that hot stripper blonde that's on vacation with the other ladies from Hooters?  I used to strap mines to my head, and I put them to enemy boats.  Right.  Now I've got to play with this special child who's drooling on me.  Oh, I remember this. 
[02:13:00]  Isn't this the theme to Flipper?  They call him Flipper, Flipper, swimming with retards.  The one you see is smarter than me.  Smarter than me.  Not the kids he's swimming with.  Balancing their heads on his nose because he thinks it's a big dumb ball.  All I've learned under the sea.  Everyone was the king of the sea. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, Jesus.  This is nice music.  Tricks he will do.  Tricks.  Tries to jump over his big head, but it's too big.  Crashes into the ear and falls back.  Sneaks under and bites the kid's foot for making him look fancy.  Dolphin almost dies because the kid's big tongue gets stuck in his slow hole. 
[02:14:00]  I can't breathe, kid.  Dolphin!  Puppy!  Kitten!  Yeah, right.  Okay.  That's why the dolphin's jumping out of the water.  He's just saying, get me away from this retard.  Okay, terrific.  That's mean.  Yeah, it is really mean.  They're trying to do something nice and we're mocking them. 
[02:14:30]  I don't mean it.  That's horrible.  That's why there's a three-month wait to swim with the dolphins.  Is there really?  You can't get close to the dolphins anymore.  Where?  Here?  It's all the rage down there in Florida.  It is all the rage.  People love swimming with dolphins.  You go to that, you're on vacation, you go to the resort there.  And you try to sign up for the dolphin excursion.  Ah, that's booked six months in advance.  I'm not saying it's inconvenient to have that in your family, but I know that there's some  parents trying to start it, but instead of a dolphin, it's a shark.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Swim with the sharks.  It's a dolphin, honey.  Yeah, pet this, you photograph ruiner.  You guys, we got a quickie.  It's only a minute and 15 seconds.  Saw a friend of mine, Dally Dooley, once.  Thought he was sleeping.  Gave him a nudge and his tongue was bitten in two.  Still plenty of it for three men, though. 
[02:15:30]  Let's drink to the dumb look on your face.  Here's to swimming with Down Syndrome women.  Sharks in the water.  Retard goes in the water.  I'll retard.  Farewell and adieu to your brain-damaged child.  I'll educate him, but it's going to take $10,000.  So we need a rocking chair once, not the shark, the kid. 
[02:16:00]  Boys, you're going to need a bigger hat.  Look out.  There it comes.  I'm Chrissy.  Yes, well, you know, we're all going to hell. 
[02:16:30]  Of course.  Instant feedback.  Like people are telling us anything new.  That's horrific.  I got a quickie.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy!  Watch them laugh. 
[02:17:00]  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the special Olympics.  You're trying to take pity.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell.  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball got to be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:17:30]  At the special Olympics.  At the special Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Take it, quirky.  At the special Olympics.  Oh, you're so sick pretty.  You can sing at my wedding when I get married.  Oh, there you have it.  Stephen Lynch with the classic.  Oh, terrible people.  I've got to go home and live with myself. 
[02:18:00]  You ever listen to yourself on replay and feel like you need a shower?  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I don't know what it is about this studio.  But once you leave it, like some bit of humanity seeps in and you're like, oh, that was really bad.  You listen to the replay and go like, oh.  That's when you hit the sidewalk and you see just normal people walking around.  You're like, oh, yeah, we're part of that society.  Oh, not the society.  The ones that might actually care about people and their feelings and if they're hurt or not. 
[02:18:30]  Then you hear a song on the radio, you drop a little tear, and you're like, when did this human being show up?  What happened?  Why am I garbage from 7 to 11?  Yeah.  They laugh at recharge children petting dolphins.  It's adorable.  And all I can think of is their dumb toes being bitten and laughing at them.  They have their dumb heads knock the Christmas tree over.  How all their hair looks the same when they get out of that pool.  It looks the same when they go in.  He's got the Moe Howard. 
[02:19:00]  I remember we were talking about retiring people, which could have been any one of a hundred shows.  And you were saying in the family photographs, hey, did you see a big Pete Rose haircut behind the fucking...  Pete Rose.  Oh, the Moe Howard, right.  Oh, that was awful.  Awful.  What do you want?  I want the Logan.  All right. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  Give me the Elon.  Hey, you guys.  Let's say hi to Drew Curtis from Fark.com.  Yes.  Hi, Drew.  Hi, guys.  Welcome him back.  You made me cry.  Yeah.  Actually, I want to thank him personally for helping us out with that Arthur Chien thing.  Yeah, that was a good time.  Oh, my God.  That video...  Yeah, you got a good response on Fark.  Oh, yeah.  That's right up our alley, man.  People love the videos of other people self-destructing.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  They play them over and over and then get to comment on them.  Yeah.  And not a high percentage of O&A fans on Fark. 
[02:20:00]  I've noticed that.  They hate everything.  Is that what it is?  They blame everything.  It's great.  Because any time something from the show...  You guys see something they really hate.  That's really bad.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a couple of shows I've done in L.A. that they just absolutely can't stand.  Cannot stand.  Oh, it's brutal.  I've read some stuff that, you know, you appear on the show and then there's comments and it's  just like...  And you know the people never heard the show.  I don't know it from a hole in the wall, but...  You know, they're like, oh, those shock jocks and I heard that they did the St. Pat's 
[02:20:30]  thing and they're awful and I don't know why...  He never even heard the show.  Yeah.  For the love of God.  And guys that are going to a site to see awful things.  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you going down and down on legitimate nice things?  No, it's awful shit you want to see.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, the ones that get the biggest hits are the ones that are the most awful, graphic,  tasteless.  And then there'll be the people that look at it time and time again.  And it'll have like 300 comments about how this is awful and terrible. 
[02:21:00]  This is horrible.  Let me check it out again.  Yeah, check it out.  I'll look at it again.  I don't know.  It's, you know, the guy at the pizza place.  That one got a great response.  Yeah, yeah.  Getting beat up at the pizza.  Actually, disturbing video.  This big black guy.  First, he gets in an argument with this big, fat black woman.  Yeah.  And then I guess her boyfriend is standing at the door and punches this guy with this fist  that's like a friggin' roast right in the guy's face.  He goes down and the guy doesn't stop. 
[02:21:30]  And all the white guys in the pizza place are just standing around watching.  There we go.  Because they're not going to say anything.  It was like watching Charles Grodin get stepped on.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Jeez.  There was someone we had up last week, the chick that got tasered by the cop.  Yeah, that's another good one.  Ma'am, I'm going to taser you.  Ma'am, I'm going to taser you.  Four or five, ten times, and she just sitting there and finally,  all right, there you go.  Can't say you didn't warn you.  You know, that's one of our favorite audio clips that has come in in recent weeks.  We played the audio on our show. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I am not get involved guy, too.  I am absolutely not get involved guy because I think too far ahead.  I think about consequences.  I think about things I've seen before, which I saw a video clip once of some guy,  and I think it was in a convenience store, a guy with a gun.  Another guy is behind him, kind of to the side, and decides this is his chance to be a hero.  He grabs the guy and puts him in some kind of choke hold. 
[02:22:30]  The guy struggles out of it and just blows the guy away.  Shoots him a couple of times in the body, and the guy is sitting there, puts his hand up like,  okay, you win, and the guy comes right up to him, boom, shoots him right in the head, he falls down.  Like, why wouldn't you just stand there and let the guy rob this place?  I'll say there's a difference, though, between some guy robbing a cash register with a gun.  You don't fuck with a gun.  Yeah.  And this is a, although this guy was getting his ass beat, it was a one-on-one with no weapons involved.  Still, you don't know if the guy starts getting, the guy's getting his ass beat because he got sucker punched, 
[02:23:00]  and he was on the ground already, and the black guy's beating him up.  If all of a sudden you come over now to confront him, who knows what he's got.  No, I mean, that's why I probably wouldn't get involved, A, because the guy was huge,  and B, because it was a one-on-one, but then he robbed him.  He had four years in jail for that, and his girlfriend got like 18 months.  Good.  Yeah, absolutely good.  For animals, of course.  But no, never get involved.  I would never get involved.  I don't care what it is.  And this stems back, and I remember this situation back in junior high. 
[02:23:30]  Actually, no, it was elementary school.  I believe it was sixth grade or something like that.  I was standing by the lockers, and some girl, some pretty girl, has her locker opened,  and her head is kind of half in the locker, and she's looking for something.  And some black kid came walking by and kicked the locker, and it slammed right on her head,  and she's kneeling on the floor now, crying her eyes out.  I felt so bad, and I thought, like, the little fantasy plays out in your head for that split second. 
[02:24:00]  Like, I run over.  I'm going to grab that guy, punch his face in, go over there, make sure she's okay.  She'll fall in love with me.  It's going to be fantastic.  I stood there with my zitty face just doing nothing.  I did nothing.  I turned and walked away, and that's the story of my life.  I will never, ever get involved with anything.  If someone's getting hurt, sorry it's you, but I got things to do.  That's right.  Isn't that horrible? 
[02:24:30]  That's...  I'm not the hero guy.  I thought you actually might have stepped in, and something happened, and then...  Step in?  And that was the last, you know, time you actually stepped in.  Nope.  She got a head full of locker, and I couldn't be bothered.  It's a weird mentality, though, because that's...  And I'm guilty of it, too.  That's how, like, 9-11 happened.  People not having this will...  I mean, it's why with a guy holding a razor to somebody's throat, but people don't get involved.  But you got a plane full of people there.  Well, and up until that point, that's what they were telling everybody to do.  You know, now all bets are off.  That's why this...  Now you're right.  Now, if something happens in a plane, the guy usually ends up dying because 50 people 
[02:25:00]  are shitting on him, and he was just a little drunk, you know?  How many hits can I get in on this guy before he passes out, you know?  That's a good point.  Hey, dude, man, because then they'll have the story.  This guy was charging the fucking cockpit, dude.  I fucking wound up.  I punched him in the face.  I fucking laid the motherfucker out.  So why are you in jail?  He's a fucking pilot.  He's like checking the wing or some shit.  No, you're right.  A little overzealous.  On the last flight, they did attack once they realized it was...  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, that's a good point.  Yeah, but it is the sheep mentality and that whole thing where I don't want to be the guy. 
[02:25:30]  I don't want to get involved.  I don't want to start getting involved.  So you kind of sit there.  Yeah, but see, that's on a plane.  You are involved.  Right.  Anything that happens on a plane, you're involved.  That's true, too.  Is that instinct, though?  Because you look at, like, you never see zebras protecting each other from lions.  They all just amperate.  And the sick and dead ones just die.  Yeah.  They eat it.  That's the old and the young will perish.  I am running for my life.  Running my striped ass off. 
[02:26:00]  Well, you know what's funny is, actually, I think it's actually an American thing.  I spent a year in Europe, and a great example of that, I was coming across Greece, and there  was a strike.  They basically shut down all the trains, because there's only one train, apparently, that  goes east-west.  And what happened was we had to stop in a small town, get off, take a taxi, walk through  the picket line, get another taxi, get on the train on the other side, and keep going.  So here's the thing.  I don't understand what's going on, because I don't speak Greek.  Luckily, there was a gal there who did.  Speak Greek.  What does that mean in the ad?  Yeah, exactly.  That means, do you like your keister wreck?  Exactly. 
[02:26:30]  And so we're sitting there, and they're explaining this to us.  There were about 25 people at the station, and there's one cab in town.  And everybody knows this.  They've got this figured out.  The one cab pulls up, and I swear to God, everybody, rather than say, okay, well, let's  get the old people in first, you know, get the kids over there, because it was a hot  day.  No, man, everybody just took off on a dead sprint for the cab.  Really?  Like, all of them just ran over there, fought each other off, cab drives away again.  Every single time this cab came back, the same damn thing happened.  Everybody just went right for it again.  No one really cares about their fellow man. 
[02:27:00]  No, not at all.  It really is true.  It's great.  It's an exceptional person that will try to help someone out.  Yesterday, where was it, Rockaway?  A guy died.  Rockaway.  Rockaway.  Swimming.  Kid was in the water, couldn't swim, got caught in some of these rip currents that go on down  there, and this guy jumps in the water to save him, and ends up dying in the water.  I would be standing out there.  You know what I would do?  The extent of what I would do, I'd have my cell phone with me. 
[02:27:30]  I'll call someone that is trained to help this guy.  If he can hold on out there, God bless him, I called 911.  But as far as swimming out there and trying to help him, sorry, bud, you're on your own.  You are on your own.  They usually bring you down with them, because they're struggling.  Yeah.  Every year you read about someone, and boy, if the stereotype of black people not being able  to swim can be just prolonged any more than this, the kid that was swimming, or his mom  says he couldn't swim, but he's out there in the water off Rockaway for some reason. 
[02:28:00]  He can't swim.  And then another guy that jumps in to save him, he dies trying to save him.  The black can't swim stereotype is huge.  Put on swimmies.  I don't like the butterfly water wings or something.  Yeah, that's not good.  Yeah, I got some of my water wings.  Get to a gang color swimmies.  I look stupid, but I'm not going to die. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, one's wearing bloods, one's wearing crypts, he's dog paddling towards him.  I'm going to fuck you up.  Oh, God.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with Drew Curtis from FARC.com, all right?  Yeah, I got a stack of breaking stuff for you.  Well, sort of.  Nice.  We'll do that now.  Broken, I guess.  Did you hear about the fucking, the release of Trinket Town made from Gorilla Hands?  It's been like a huge hit already.  Really?  Beautiful.  Where can you get that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Eatabullet.com if you want.  Who cares?  It's not important where to get it. 
[02:29:00]  The important thing is that it's there.  Right.  Also, Anthony, the Tony Awards were last night.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And the Tonys.  What's the award they give away?  Who looks best in a bathrobe?  And the award for wasting away with the most dignity is.  We have Billy Crystal, Mario Cantone, and Nathan Lane all bombing at the Tonys that we'll play after the break.  All bombing.  Good times.  Billy Crystal bombed one, two, three, four, five times. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, what did he do?  The whole, ah, thing.  I don't know.  We'll get into that whole flamboyant gay thing.  I think Nathaniel put this together for us.  You're a good boy, fan.  Is it good audio of people bombing or?  You like?  Yeah, if you like that sort of thing.  We do.  Of course we do.  Hey, what did Danny put together for us?  Anything?  Where's Danny?  Danny?  What did, ah, nothing?  Got somebody from last year's Oscars, do you?  MTV Movie Awards.  Danny Fizzy answering the phones today.  All right, as we go to break, that Florida Taser story is still, it's worth a replay. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, it's beautiful.  Listen to this.  The video, is it still up on fart.com?  Yeah, it's somewhere in the archives now.  Yeah, you've got to go search it.  The funny thing about the video page is there's actually, like, a director's commentary track  you can click on to hear them talk about it.  That's a great idea.  The police will, yeah, here's where they notify the individual, then blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the funny thing is you're watching this horrible thing and the woman who's interviewing  is like, so is this, this is appropriate police procedure?  It's like, oh yeah, nothing wrong with it.  You're right.  Why didn't she get out of the car when she was asked?  She was actually on the phone, which is even funny. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, on the phone.  You'll hear it when they play it.  It's hilarious.  She's on the phone, like, giving play-by-play.  Okay, now the cop's coming over to my car.  Okay, now he's telling me to get out of the car.  How about you hang up your friggin' phone and you get out and do what the cop is telling  you to do?  If you have nothing to worry about, if you've got nothing to worry about.  Yeah, pretty much.  You've got your licenses clean, everything, everything's fine and dandy.  Get the fuck out of the car.  Yeah.  You're not going to get tasered.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Well, the video's up on OPNXD.com as well.  Do they need the taser, do you think?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm very pro-cop.  They could justify it.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Whether they need it.  Could they have dove in there and pulled her out physically?  Yeah.  You know something?  You'd probably get a little scratched up.  Yeah.  Because she wasn't being threatening him.  To my knowledge, she wasn't.  I don't know what she was doing.  She was just being a belligerent.  She was just being a twat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, a cop doesn't want to get hurt.  Cops don't want to get hurt.  You go in there, you start digging around.  She's got them big, long nails.  Fuck it.  Taser her.  That's right.  Gotta get her out.  Makes life easier.  It certainly does, the taser.  Are the cops in trouble or no?  No.  No.  That's completely legit. 
[02:31:30]  It's all good.  Okay.  And it's sergeant commentary.  I thought you meant some of your fans of your website did some commentary.  No, no.  That would be hilarious.  That would be good though.  That would be really funny.  That's right.  All right.  Well, here's the story and how it went down.  How would you like it if you were tasered by a cop?  Well, this happened in Florida to one woman, but police review all the cases where forces  used.  They say this one was justified.  He'd be the judge.  For speeding.  You're doing 51 miles an hour.  The speed limit dial.  See, Chris, is 435.  Pointon Beach Police Officer Rich McNevin pulled the driver of this Isuzu over for speeding. 
[02:32:00]  He finds the driver, Victoria Goodwin, also has a broken windshield and a brake light  out.  Officer McNevin then learns that Goodwin is driving without a license and returns to arrest  her.  Should I put your cigarette out?  I'll step out of the vehicle for me.  But Goodwin stays in the car, talking on her phone.  Officer McNevin reaches in to pull her out.  He's arresting me.  Stop.  Don't touch me.  The policeman, you're going to shoot me.  He's got a gun and he's going to shoot me.  Three times, Officer McNevin warns Goodwin that he will use his taser. 
[02:32:30]  Get out of the car or I'm going to tase you.  The next street off the secret.  Get out of your stomach.  Get out of your stomach.  On your stomach.  Do it now.  Put your hands behind your back.  Do it now.  Do it now or you're going to get tased again.  The officer hits her with his taser a second time.  Goodwin screams and cries for two more minutes before officers move her to the squad car. 
[02:33:00]  It's over and done with.  We've been tased before.  We know it's not that bad.  I don't care what you say.  I've never been tased before.  Okay.  The Palm Beach Post off in Boynton Beach Training Sergeant Sedgwick Aiken to offer a police perspective.  Why use the taser while Goodwin was in the car?  She pulled away from him.  Basically, she escalated the use of force.  Why then was the second taser used while Goodwin was already on the ground?  We haven't patted her down.  No one searched to see if she has any weapons or anything on her person.  And if you go in and rush her and try to place hands on her, place her on the wrist, 
[02:33:30]  she can injure her officer or become an injured herself.  All Boynton Beach police get tasered as part of their training so they do understand what  they are doing to people when they do use their tasers.  Whip them out Wednesday.

God damn it, what nice is this?  Some people call them the bosom.  Oh, yes.  So ladies from all over the country, if you feel like showing us a little something something,  Whip them out Wednesday.  This message was brought to you by the cooperative staff at the Opie and Anthony program.  I realize you're mine. 
[02:34:30]  And we are full of mine.  And I realize you're mine.  And we are full of mine.  In studio this morning, we got Drew Curtis from Fark.com with breaking news, right?  Stuff that's going to go up on the site?  Yeah.  It's already queued up.  It's either there already or it's coming soon.  Ooh.  What do you got over there? 
[02:35:00]  Well, we got Angelina Jolie during a stunt on the last movie.  Apparently, she wasn't wearing any underwear in one of the outfits.  Uh-oh.  I hope that makes the outtakes.  But here's the thing.  She claims that she couldn't tell that she wasn't wearing underwear.  Like, she just, like, forgot.  Doesn't that sound like a...  Inadvertently left without her underwear.  That's like a Cinemax moment or something.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Does that happen in real life?  What kind of stunt was she doing?  Something like jump through a window here.  She's wearing a Dominator outfit in one scene.  The panties are getting so small that they could forget that they're actually wearing them at this point.  Yeah.  I can't tell if it's still in there or not. 
[02:35:30]  But I don't know.  I see stuff like this, and I just think they're just trying to get cover for their movie.  Of course they are.  They just made that crap up.  Maybe her without underwear.  Yeah.  That would be good, yeah.  Or you just have to imagine it or something.  I was reading today in the post that if you want to interview, like, Jolie or Brad Pitt about this movie,  you can't, you know, ask about their personal stuff, really.  And you have to sign a contract.  Saying you won't do it?  You won't do it, and then if you do do it, you get sued.  Huh.  You can only talk about the movie.  Who wants to see...  Look, I'm sorry. 
[02:36:00]  Brad Pitt, I know we differ.  I don't like him.  I don't think he's that great of an actor.  It's like your personal life is interesting.  Stop banging the hottest chick in Hollywood.  Yeah, exactly.  And having your picture taken.  What do you think?  We don't want to know about that?  Your film acting is so interesting.  You're not Brando stupid.  It really is funny, some of these actors, where they're like, they're involved in these,  like you said, screwing one of the hottest chicks in Hollywood, and they expect you to  not talk about it.  Yeah.  Especially when you're Brad Pitt.  It's like, dude, all you do is get...  You bang the hottest girl.  Sorry, we're interested.  Yeah, that's a great problem to have. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, gee, what's it like to fuck Angelina Jolie?  I don't want to talk about that.  Let's talk about another wooden performance.  I'll be on top of a building with a freaking bullhorn telling the world.  I have fucked Angelina Jolie.  I will tell you everything about her pussy.  Yeah, I would drive down the middle of Manhattan.  I'd have a ticket tape parade for myself.  Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.  I have fucked Angelina Jolie.  It was fabulous. 
[02:37:00]  That is beautiful.  One small step for man, one giant load for Brad.  That kind of Hollywood stuff happens all the time.  Remember, whoever Britney Spears handlers are, they're masters at doing this.  Like, for example, they were releasing rumors that Prince Harry was upset that she was  writing letters to him or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just a queen made up.  That was all fake.  Yeah, and he was like, I've never talked to her.  I don't know what's going on.  This doesn't make any sense at all.  It's basically just get her back in the news again.  It was one of those English sites or papers.  I hate going to anything from an English site. 
[02:37:30]  If I'm on Drudge and I see a news story and it's a little sensational, it's like...  Where did that come from?  Yeah, Korea smuggles a nuclear bomb into America.  And you're like, wait, the Korean...  And I click it and I see that .uk thing show up in the address.  I'm like, okay, it's bullshit.  And it's like, from the mirror, yes, a report have it that there was a Korean that had said 
[02:38:00]  that his brother-in-law had somehow figured a way to smuggle it.  And it's all fake speculation.  It's all crap.  British media is awful.  It is real.  I don't know how they get any real news over there.  What is it?  It's always the stupid mirror or it's all the tabloids.  The sun.  Yeah, basically.  They have a lot of them.  We only have a few.  They're worse than we have here.  Oh, they look at the Post like it's the Times over there.  Forget about it.  It's just about the only news source they have is the BBC and that's it.  Forget it.  And I lived there for a year and while we were there, actually they are horrible at domestic 
[02:38:30]  news reporting.  Like, you want to know what's going on in England?  Don't listen to the BBC.  They won't tell you.  You want to know what's going on in South Africa?  Got it covered.  No problem.  That's their whole...  Down the street?  ...realistic...  They're horribly boring people.  Horribly boring.  The BBC, I know the news isn't supposed to be exciting, but it's just so dry and awful  and it symbolizes everything about them.  Really?  Just dry and awful.  Uh-huh.  You just want to claw your eyes out watching them.  I saw some Travel Channel show the other day on England and they were trying to push  how good the food is now. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, man.  Because it's gotten such a bad rap over the years because it sucks.  Yeah, it's awful.  England is not known for its food.  No.  So they're talking, some of the best restaurants in the world are now in London, where you can...  And I'm like, no, I'm not buying this one.  Only if the end of that sentence isn't run by people from India and China, I'll be like,  okay, well...  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe so, yeah.  That's the only thing you can eat.  That's why Indian food is so popular over there because everything else is just awful.  It just sucks.  Yeah.  It's the only thing you can eat. 
[02:39:30]  If you want to get people to England, the whole commercial should be, would you like  to hear a girl say, I want to suck your cock?  If you want to hear that accent, please press five now.  I kind of want to hear you say it again.  And I kind of wanted to say it.  Speaking of India, actually, one of the other ones that came in this morning was two giant  toads were married in a traditional Hindu ceremony in eastern India in order to appease  the rain gods.  The rain gods.  Because that's what the rain gods want to have happen.  Get some giant toads.  Get them married.  Let me just check something. 
[02:40:00]  It's 2005.  Okay.  I had a look at the paper.  I had to see what year it was.  All cultures are equal.  That's right.  All cultures are equal.  That is right.  We should just embrace them as a culture.  That's perfectly legitimate.  Absolutely.  We need some rain.  Well, get those frogs, bitch.  The frogs have got to get married.  You fucking dumb chimps.  That's not going to do anything to help it rain.  This is beautiful.  Could you imagine, like, the governor of a state getting up there and saying, we've had some  problem with the farming. 
[02:40:30]  We haven't got enough rain, but I'm doing something for you.  We're going to wed these big toads.  And what this will do is bring some rain.  Questions from the press.  Questions?  Exactly.  From the rain gods.  Yeah.  From the rain gods.  Right.  They're waiting for this.  They're hanging out.  And you know, like the Today Show, Regis would show up and say, where are they going to  honeymoon?  And everybody would laugh.  Not in this studio.  And we get bashed in this country by other nations for just inventing everything and being 
[02:41:00]  great.  And, you know, we get such a hard time from other countries.  I hate the rest of the world.  I've been offered gigs in Europe many times.  Like, you know, whether it's not Australia, not Europe, but I mean, you know, England, Ireland.  I don't go.  Why?  Glad you cleared that up.  No, but I was saying, like, I won't do it for what?  I was going on a European vacation and I was going to go to Sydney and, well.  Never mind.  How was Europe?  Well, Kenya was nice.  It was great.  I have no, just no desire to hear that.  And you know, like, most comedians that succeed over in those places are these fucking dogshit  whores. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Trash America.  You know, yeah, George Bush is stupid.  Oh, you're right.  You're absolutely right.  It's like, wait a minute.  You fucking.  That's all you got?  You sellout.  Speaking of Australia, this is working out real well.  There was a woman who was captured by custom officials attempting to smuggle 51 live fish  up her skirt.  Up her skirt?  Up her skirt.  Or up in her.  In her.  Well, they said up the skirt.  Up the skirt.  When searching the vagina, they can find no actual fish, only the remnants. 
[02:42:00]  Actually, the quote is great.  It says, during the search, customs officers became suspicious after hearing, quote, flipping  noises coming from the vicinity of her waist.  Up.  Wow.  What's that, mate?  All you're flipping noises, eh?  Yeah.  Were they in a bag or were they just in a box?  It says she had a specially designed skirt, some kind of bag, basically.  But they were alive.  Oh, it wasn't on her vagina.  It was in her skirt.  Well, they don't say.  It could have been.  Who knows?  You never know about this.  What the hell was she doing with fish?  Where was she going?  She was smuggling them.  I don't know.  That's Singapore, it looks like. 
[02:42:30]  A big smuggling thing for fish?  Apparently so.  Well, and here's the thing, because I don't understand this either, but they were saying that basically  they're waiting to find out what kind of fish they are, because apparently that makes a  difference.  If they're endangered fish, apparently, and I don't know where the hell, I guess somebody  did a big currency calculation, it's a per fish, $83,617 if it ends up being a specific  species.  Well, you never...  Because that's a pretty exact number.  Can you see that?  You know, the guy writing the code.  You know we should find these people?  $83,617.  That's about right.  I think that's what it's worth.  Not $18 or $60? 
[02:43:00]  Right on the dot.  Ah, it's beautiful.  Oh, and you guys will like this.  Babysitter's mom says, sex charges are exaggerated.  Uh-oh.  What's that about?  It's another babysitter committing sex acts with an 11-year-old boy.  Jesus.  I love the quote.  They're talking to her mom.  This must be in Florida.  I can only imagine.  Yeah, it actually is.  See?  Florida.  They love their kids' sex down in Florida.  I can tell.  The quote is, they're talking to the woman's mom, the one's in trouble, and she says,  I'm not saying all of it didn't happen.  I asked Charity, the woman who did it, what happened, and she said, Mommy, I was drunk. 
[02:43:30]  I don't remember.  Mommy, I was drunk.  I don't remember.  The woman's 20.  20.  That's the woman who did it, telling her mom.  Oh, the 20-year-old that did it said, Mommy, I was drunk.  I was drunk.  I don't remember.  So the babysitter's 20.  She's drunk.  Has sex with the 11-year-old boy.  But can you see that?  It's like, okay, I got a babysitting gig tonight.  Give me a couple shots of tequila.  I'm going to go right over there and get started.  Yeah.  But it gets even worse.  Basically.  Worse?  Yeah, the affidavits indicate that the woman.  You mean better.  It's hotter.  Did you forget which show you're on?  This is a horror thing. 
[02:44:00]  Wrong adjective.  Actually, this gets even hotter.  More appropriate.  I don't know, man.  This isn't my thing.  They said she touched the boy inappropriately, then punched and squeezed his genitals, quote,  to hurt the victim, while the other two kids watched.  She was babysitting.  Wow.  Oh, I bet you those rooms were clean by the end of the night.  Exactly.  Get them all turned on and then punch him in the genitals.  Pow!  How about them apples?  You squeeze that little gherkin.  You know what?  It's training him for marriage. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  Get yourself all worked up.  Everything fine.  You're feeling good about yourself.  Bam!  Right in the nuts.  Exactly.  The beautiful part is it says this was not her first arrest.  She was actually arrested, got three years probation in 2003, after pleading guilty to  felony burglary.  Burglary?  Now, imagine this, okay?  This is your babysitter.  You call this gal up who shows up drunk.  She's got a felony arrest on her record and you want her to take care of your kids.  Nice.  The parents of these kids are the ones that ought to be in trouble.  The fact that they even had her over there in the first place.  We used to have some pretty outrageous babysitters back when I was a kid. 
[02:45:00]  Not even like a kid where, you know, I was 12 having sex or anything like that.  I mean, when I was about eight and my brother was nine or ten and my sister was, I don't  know, five or whatever she was, we'd have babysitters that would come over in Central  Island, Long Island, when I was living out there, and just invite their friends over  where there would be parties, orgies, drugs going on.  And I was more afraid of the whole thing.  Like, I would just cower around.  But my brother was just drinking, smoking cigarettes at like nine years old, smoking with 
[02:45:30]  these local, you know, early teen neighborhood kids.  Boys and girls were over there making out on the couch and stuff like that.  And Joe was like, you know, kissing friggin' girls that are, he's nine years old, he's  making out with girls that are 13, 14, drinking my father's boots, smoking cigarettes.  It was great.  And I was like, why?  Let's go to the phone real fast.  Josh in Utah.  Josh.  Hey, what's going on, fellas? 
[02:46:00]  Hello, Josh.  What's your story?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  When I was about eight to ten, between the ages of eight to ten, my parents were working  and I had this babysitter that I was probably, I'd say in high school at least, and she would  always have me lick her pussy and shit like that.  And I can remember, you know, just freaking out, wondering, you know, it was really hairy  and it tasted really fucked up.  And she would, like, suck on my dick a little bit.  But it was never anything to, like, a full, well, to orgasm or anything like that. 
[02:46:30]  But I can remember, you know, all that kind of shit.  And I wasn't one of these pussies that told my parents, hell, I was kind of pissed when  they got rid of the babysitter, so.  Especially if you're, like, 11 or 12 and your 20-year-old babysitter is seducing you.  I've got to go with it.  Yeah, and you're telling your friends.  That's what you're telling.  You're going to brag a little bit.  You're not mentally scarred by that.  Yeah, I didn't tell nobody shit.  I didn't want to fucking give out the free ass, man.  I wanted all that for myself.  It's so different for a boy than it is for a girl. 
[02:47:00]  You know, if you had the 20-year-old guy and he was hired to watch an 11-year-old girl  and, you know, all of a sudden starts doing things, he's absolutely going to prison and  it's awful and stuff.  But again, you hear a story like this, you think back to when you were 11.  But now, there are very mature 11 years old and very, you know, immature.  There certainly are.  I know.  I know when I was 11 or even 12, you know, already I was, you know, jacking it to magazines.  Popping boners. 
[02:47:30]  You're looking at girls and just trying to work it and trying to get laid and everything.  And, you know, there are others that just want no part of it, and I'm sure it would  just screw them up mentally if they were seduced by their babysitter.  But, you know, some of them, I guess they have sex with them, don't ever say a word,  and you never hear anything of it.  It's the ones that rat out those little tattletales.  Yeah.  You know, who's going to go tell your mom?  Let's go to South Carolina.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I lived in Germany when my dad was in the military. 
[02:48:00]  I had a babysitter who wouldn't let me have my candy at night unless she sucked my dick.  What a bitch.  Yeah.  Wow.  My life is rough, man.  It really sucked me up good.  Good times.  Gee.  You probably think about that every day of your life, don't you, Chris?  This discussion brought up some nice memories.  Gets a boner whenever he sees a Pez dispenser.  Yeah.  Twizzlers.  Ooh, no candy until... 
[02:48:30]  Nice.  Did you get the grandma sex story?  Prostitution?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a pretty good one.  That was a beautiful one.  Yeah, that popped out on Sunday.  Heard that on Wednesday.  I heard that on Wednesday this morning.  Yeah.  I was really excited.  I thought we had something.  Then it turns out she was just kind of taking the phone calls for this prostitution ring.  Yeah, it was amazing.  She's like the secretary, not really a madam.  An 80-year-old grandma was pretty much running a brothel, August Playmates.  Jimmy, you know that one?  No.  Where are they located at, in Sweden?  Police made a surprising discovery when they busted the alleged madam of a prostitution ring 
[02:49:00]  called August Playmates.  The woman running the show was an 80-year-old grandmother, and she basically kept 60 out of  every $160.  That's all.  So they charge $160, she keeps 60.  She keeps 60.  That's a big cut for just taking the phone calls.  Yeah, really, seriously.  I think she's doing a little more than taking the phone calls.  If she's getting that big a cut, they said she was on oxygen, too, in a wheelchair or  something.  Yeah.  So she's really decrepit.  It would have been a better story if she was still turning the trick. 
[02:49:30]  You don't need that when you're trying to get a whore to come over.  You know, what?  I just wanted, how much for a blowjob?  Huh?  What?  Leaving like Darth Vader with her oxygen on.  You're looking for a job.  No, I...  I'm going to get my dick sucked.  Oh, he's stuck!  I need some anal.  Yeah, kid!  Weird!  Listen, do these girls do Greek? 
[02:50:00]  What do you mean, are they weak?  Miss.  I'm a bit deep.  We've got another babysitter story.  Glenn, what's up?  What's wrong, guys?  Hey.  Hey, it's Clint, not Glenn.  You're screener's an idiot.  I'm sorry.  No, maybe yours certainly is.  Maybe your name is Glenn and you're stupid.  Good point.  I think it's the screener.  Yeah, me too.  I did the babysitter thing where I played doctor and she would tell me what to do.  And she came and she would suck my cock.  And then when she would want me to reciprocate and do it to her. 
[02:50:30]  But she always had that white cottage cheese shit on her thing.  Oh, probably a yeast infection.  Yeah.  It does.  That's where if you hug the stomach, it blurbs out a little bit.  Oh, God.  It looks like Caesar's dressing.  Sounds like the voice of expression.  Yeah, believe me.  She's want to hug her and all of a sudden you've got salad on your shoes.  Oh, God.  Well, either there's something wrong with you or your pussy's on a diet.  Horrible.  Oh, man. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I want you to go down on me.  All right, we'll throw a little fruit salad in there first.  I said I wanted this on the side.  Let's go to Freak Show, the trucker.  Freak Show.  That's horrid.  It really is very disturbing.  Freak Show, you got something to know?  Hello.  We lost Freak Show.  You had a good story, too.  What was that sister?  Sister would make him eat her friends up.  Our friends?  Yeah.  The sister was pimping out?  Wow. 
[02:51:30]  He was 25 and the sister was 6.  Uh-oh.  Could be a problem.  Yeah, it's jail time.  I used to make my sister's friends do handstands whenever they had sleepover parties at my sister's house.  Jesus.  I guess I was, let me think, I was probably 9.  My sister and her friends were probably 7 or something like that.  And they would come over the house.  Maybe I was 10.  I don't even remember.  I thought you were talking about when we were up in Boston.  No.  No.  My sister's friends would come over for sleepovers and they'd put their little nightgowns on. 
[02:52:00]  Of course.  And I would say, okay, it's time for a handstand, a headstand contest.  So, you know, go against the wall and do a handstand.  And they would do it.  And, of course, their nightgowns would flop over their heads and I'd see their little panties.  I would do that, too.  And with it, I'd go, oh, your panties are showing.  Ruin the whole thing.  Silly goose.  You don't say anything.  They don't know.  And they'd punch them in their genitals.  Yeah, I got one more.  I can't really follow up the babysitter story.  But somebody stole a 300-pound Charlie Brown statue in Santa Rosa, California. 
[02:52:30]  They thought it was a 300-pound Charlie Brown statue.  It was actually Ben Sparks.  Don't put me down.  Good grief, dude.  Good grief.  You know that somewhere that story starts with this one time we were drinking and that's how it goes.  There's always some stories.  Some statues getting stolen.  Yeah, exactly.  He'll probably get, like, photographs from it.  It'll be in Paris this time next week.  There's always some stone guy. 
[02:53:00]  Dude, you go down to his basement.  Dude, I stole the Ronald McDonald down from the front of McDonald's.  I rock.  And then you come down and realize, what the fuck am I going to do with this?  And my dad's going to kill me when he comes down here.  Yes.  Gotta love it.  Bravo.  Drew Curtis from Fark.com.  It's a fantastic site.  Yeah.  Love it.  Love it.  Go there every day.  Someone keeps signing me up with the little extra special Fark.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, they're buying it for you.  Yeah, they buy it for me every month. 
[02:53:30]  What's it called?  Total Fark.  Total Fark.  It's the subscription part of it, yeah.  Which is the subscription part.  All I know it's good for is I could then look at the subject for the Photoshop contest well  before they're posted.  Yeah, like three or four days in advance.  So I could get it, you know, I could get in there when there's only four or five of them  done instead of, you know, there's already 50 and I don't even place in some of it.  I get my two votes on my brilliant work.  Are you doing the contest?  Of course I do.  Well, why don't you plug it on this radio program?  Maybe people will go there and take a look at it.  It's part of my, if I plug it on like Whack Bag or something, sometimes I'll post them 
[02:54:00]  over there and stuff.  But no, it's fun, you know?  They give you a good subject like Photoshop, you know, these guys going down the grass sled.  Yeah, or the one that was Photoshop scenes from Miss Heard Lyrics, which was one that  came out yesterday.  It was absolutely brilliant.  That's a good one.  It was a good time.  So yeah, it's stuff like that.  It's a little creativity.  You get to practice with Photoshop a little bit.  Get cigars and scotch in there to get some Photoshop worked on.  It certainly is.  And they're funny as hell, even if you don't Photoshop, to go through them, scroll through  them, you'll laugh your ass off.  It's kind of like our comic section for the newspaper, basically. 
[02:54:30]  Some of these guys are really good at Photoshop, and some of them are not as good as Photoshop,  but really funny concepts.  And at least one guy's really good at MS Paint.  Yeah.  That's all he does.  Oh my God.  Some of these awful ones that are just like, yeah, spray-painted head on something.  Exactly.  Horrible.  You're just like, what the hell, man?  And you know it's never going to be good when it's prefaced with, my first Photoshop  again.  I'm trying to soften the blow, stupid.  It certainly looks like it.  They cut the head out, and it's square, and the background is still on it, and they slap 
[02:55:00]  it over a picture.  Do you guys ever see that site?  Someone emailed us a page called, I'm smarter than your kids, or I'm better than your kids,  and it's like this adult critiques the artwork of four and five-year-olds, but he grades  them, and he gives them all like Fs and Ds, because they colored outside the lines.  Oh, that's heartlessly funny.  And the really funny one was this little kid drew a fire truck with like little things  coming off of it, and he's like, what is this hairy piece of shit coming in?  It's like two fucking six-year-olds.  That sounds great. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, it's really funny.  Oh, we're going to have to check that out.  We got it up over here.  It's hysterical.  There's an awful picture of a dog that some kid drew.  And his line is, first of all, I don't even know what this is.  If it's supposed to be a dog, then it's the shittiest dog I've ever seen.  F.  And then there's a kid.  What a horrible human.  It's very funny.  This is the best site ever.  Yeah, it is.  That's great.  Then there's a kid that's trying to draw the American flag, and it says, God bless America  and you, but he spelled America wrong.  So the guy writes, you spelled America wrong, asshole. 
[02:56:00]  I could have sworn America's colors were red, white, and blue.  That's, there's no yellow anywhere, traitor.  F.  Find the fire, like, here's an Easter bunny drawing that looks very nice from Lisa.  Age, oh, their ages are up here.  Okay.  Age six.  Age six.  There's the bunny and some eggs and stuff.  The eggs have ears, Opie.  Eggs have ears, and there's something flying in the sky, and the flowers are way too big.  I think those are clouds, Opie. 
[02:56:30]  The blue clouds.  Oh, yeah, blue are the clouds, and then these things, the flowers are bigger than her.  Uh-huh.  And he writes, holy shit, I almost had a seizure when I saw this one.  In three words, too many colors.  Also, eggs aren't supposed to have ears, dipshit.  I can't read that from here.  I didn't even realize that when I said that.  What a fucking joke-roiner I am.  This one, a simple one-word review for, uh, who is that, Carmen?  Yeah, Cameron.  Oh, Cameron, age four?  It just says, terrible.  F.  F. 
[02:57:00]  It's a great site.  It's awesome.  What's the URL of it?  What's Andrew's?  It's long.  I'll write it out.  It's long, yeah.  Yeah, we'll link it up to opianthony.com.  Go to Crappy Art 2.  Let me see some more.  All right, hold on.  You want this one?  No, okay.  Wait, let me go back up here first, though, Ant.  Oh, okay.  Where do you want me to go?  It says Crappy Art.  It says, like, only two pages of it.  They shouldn't have been there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm sure this site will explore.  Oh, there's the fire truck.  All right, fire truck.  From John, age eight.  Eight.  It really is a schizo fire truck. 
[02:57:30]  It's a mess.  It looks like he was trying to make, like, a hot rod kind of fire truck.  Yeah.  It looks like his little eyebrows coming off it.  And he worked very hard on it, it looks like.  And for a kid of eight, I think that's pretty good.  And it looks like it's growing hair.  And the guy writes, ding dong, here comes the shit mobile.  I've never seen a fire truck that needed to be shaved.  I would rather be burned to death than be saved by this hairy piece of shit.  F.  Ping, duck, here comes the shit mobile. 
[02:58:00]  Just awful.  Then they got Rachel, seven.  Seven years old.  What is that?  Explain that if you can.  I couldn't even explain it.  It looks like it's a blue background and just a white crayon.  That is, it looks to be to the left, trees and water, maybe an island and a huge wave.  Is that washing over the island?  I don't know.  That's the only way I can interpret that.  It looks like a rainbow almost.  It's supposed to be a rainbow.  Is it a rainbow?  Yeah, because I'm reading what. 
[02:58:30]  But it's one color.  I'm reading what the guy, his reviewer.  All right.  So it's all done in white.  So he writes, that's interesting.  Everyone in this picture is white.  Even the rainbow is white.  Perhaps in an ideal world, everyone would be white.  Isn't that right, Rachel?  Or should I call you racist?  Nice try, Hitler.  F.  Then we got two more.  I got three more.  What is this?  I don't know what that is.  Some of these kids are really bad artists.  What is it, though?  I don't even know what it's supposed to be.  It's just a mess.  Looks like a little house.  Jason, age six. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I guess it looks like a house, right?  A little six-year-old.  Yeah.  Maybe a house in a neighborhood.  Yeah.  This one would receive an A if the assignment was to throw as much random shit onto a paper  as poorly as you can.  I've pissed patterns on snow that look more coherent than this.  F.  I love that one.  It's a really bad car with one green wheel and one orange and, like, a little box on top  of it.  It's an awful car.  Because it's from a four-year-old.  Lil Seth.  Lil Seth.  Lil Seth made a little thing. 
[02:59:30]  You can barely even make out that it's any kind of mobile at all.  Because the only thing that kind of gives it away are the two different colored and different  size wheels.  And it looked like he was trying to make some grass, so he just scribbled green somewhere.  And it's driving sideways into the grass.  Yeah.  The only way to explain it.  Or the grass was up and down.  Up and down in front of it.  And then there's an orange, a yellow sun, of course.  All right.  And the review?  The review is Vroom F.  And finally, a nice Christmas scene. 
[03:00:00]  You got the Christmas tree.  Oh, is that it?  I don't know what that is.  From Kelly.  I guess that's a present with a bow.  Yeah.  And a snowman.  And a snowman.  And it says, Merry Christmas.  Christmas.  Right.  In red and green writing.  And that's from Kelly.  Age nine.  Age nine.  This was a Christmas gift from Kelly to her parents.  Good job, Kelly.  Now pack up your shit and find a foster home.  If my kids tried to pass this off as a gift, they'd come home from school and find all  their shit outside in a box.  What a lousy gift. 
[03:00:30]  Seriously.  You give them video games and toys and they give you some half-assed drawing with a crooked  tree.  I wonder how much a gift like this would get someone back.  Would set someone back.  Sorry.  Five, maybe ten minutes to find a napkin and some markers.  F.  F.  It's a funny sight, man.  Heartless pastor, he is.  He's funny.  It's good times.  Okay.  It's a great sight.  Beautiful.  I can't believe how much I rule.  More crappy children's artwork.  So there you go.  The website will be linked on opianthony.com. 
[03:01:00]  We'd give it out, but it really is too bad that the URL is really long and complicated.  There's like something for everyone out there in the internet, man.  Yeah, there is.  There's like, it's these little sites with the long URLs that you just, you never find.  You never bump into.  They're occupying space on the internet.  They're entertaining as hell, but you just got to trip on them over time.  And I'm glad we found that one.  Basically, yeah.  Very good, Jimmy.  Let's say hot.  Fine.  Hot Carl.  Hot Carl?  Hot Carl. 
[03:01:30]  Hot Carl.  What's up, Hot Carl?  Hey, I got a babysitter story for you.  I'll bet you do.  When I was about 13, 12 or 13, this little girl down the street, her and I had the same  babysitter.  Our parents would go out and party and whatever.  And the little girl that got babysitted with me, she was like, not quite two years younger  than me.  So it wasn't quite a pedophile thing, but she would always drop her doors for me every  night we'd get babysitted together. 
[03:02:00]  Let me see her little hairless pussy.  First piece of pussy I ever got.  All right.  Whatever.  Punch it out.  You guys don't have to punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, Drew Curtis, thanks so much, man.  Yeah, no problem.  Thanks for having me.  Drew, once again, thank you for popping in.  Another fine appearance from Drew Curtis.  Farc.com.  F-A-R-C-A dot com.  Yeah, Ben is freaking out because you were moving that mic like crazy.  Oh, I didn't realize it.  But they have to oil it again.  It was really bad that time, though. 
[03:02:30]  Stop.  I do.  I do.  Hold on.  Can they earl it?  Ben.  Can they earl it?  Too late.  All right.  Gamefly.  Too late.  Too late.  Gamefly.com, Anthony.  This is a great, great service.  We like these guys a lot because you can try out games for, I was going to say free,  but almost for free.  Very reasonable.  What's great about it is you don't have to buy games and get them home and realize they stink.  You go to Gamefly.com and they let you take out two games at a time. 
[03:03:00]  Games you keep as long as you want.  No late fees.  And if you like the game you're playing, you click on the keep it in your game queue and  you get the bin condition box and the manual, everything you would get in the store delivered  to you all at a great member discount.  It just reminds me, I'm playing, people are going to laugh at me because everyone's really  into Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  I love all the golf games.  I've played them all.  Yeah.  And I'm playing Hot Shots 4, F-O-R-E, and then, you know, the fourth version.  4, like golf.  4.  Kind of cute, right?  And I'm way into the game.  And then every once in a while you have to do a trial, like, round. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Where you have to beat the course.  You have to, in this case, I had to get minus three or better, meaning, you know.  They have things like that on Tiger Woods where you got it.  Yeah.  But this one, you know, if you land in the rough, plus two, just like that.  Oh, wow.  So every drive has to hit the fairway, and it's some kind of, like, British Open type  course with the deep bunkers.  It's real pain-ass.  I hit that windy.  Oh, the wind's blowing like crazy.  So you're starting the ball way off on the right, praying that it's going to come back 
[03:04:00]  into the fairway.  If it doesn't, you lose two right off the bat.  I played the, I was trying to beat the trial round for a week straight.  Friday night, I stayed up until, like, three in the morning.  Still didn't beat it.  And then Saturday morning, I went right back to it after, like, five, six hours sleep,  right?  And all of a sudden, I'm, what was I, seven under on the front nine.  Yeah.  I'm having a career round with this stupid game, right?  And now I'm starting, I'm drinking coffee because it's, you know, Saturday morning.  And now I have, like, caffeine just shooting through my veins. 
[03:04:30]  So my trigger finger is getting all, like, squirrely and stuff.  And I'm starting to blow it slowly but surely.  Double bogey, double bogey, bogey.  And all of a sudden, my seven under is now two under.  I'm blowing the whole fucking game when I had it beat, like, no problem.  It's always the way.  But finally, I got past that.  And now I can join the real world again.  Because that's the problem with me and video games.  I have this OCD thing.  And when I get hooked on a game, I cannot put it down. 
[03:05:00]  I'll blow off everything else.  I know I'm saying, I'm not saying anything that others haven't heard.  But with me, it's something I cannot even fathom, you know, putting the game down until I finally beat it.  There's very few casual gamers.  There's people that are so dedicated and into their video games.  I got roped back in.  Dude, hours and hours, though.  What I got roped back into.  Yes.  What?  Star Wars Galaxies.  Oh, really?  I'm back.  Wow.  Jump to Lightspeed expansion they put out.  I'm in deep now. 
[03:05:30]  I'm back.  I'm back fully involved in it.  I hate myself for it.  I reactivated my account.  I'm there.  My accounts, by the way.  Reactivated my accounts because I need the doctor and the fighter.  So I'm playing, you know, two at once.  Really?  Like Emerson Lake and Palmer on the keyboard there.  I got two levels on my own team.  Did they show Darth Vader in it?  I think, like, if you get it in a certain area or a certain level, you can. 
[03:06:00]  I've given up trying to be a Jedi.  It's impossible.  Just like episode three.  You get to see Darth for, like, two minutes at the end of the game.  Two seconds.  Actually, it's a lot easier now, Ant.  To become a Jedi?  Yeah.  It's all questions.  I'm still trying to relearn the game.  It's pissing me off.  That's the other thing.  They completely changed the game.  But also, you develop certain skills depending on the game you play.  And then you just blow it off for two or three weeks.  You're like, oh, wait.  How do I move my guy again? 
[03:06:30]  And how do I do?  Now, picture not only forgetting how to work the game, but them changing it around on you.  They changed everything.  That's only recent, the last three weeks.  The combat upgrade.  They changed the game.  They made it now where you can re-specify and reallocate points that you had gained and  all that.  So it took me forever to get these things.  And now people can just throw them around into different categories.  Yeah, well.  I'm puzzled, but I'm back.  I was talking to my brother over the weekend, and his wife got him PlayStation for Christmas. 
[03:07:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because he's like me with the weird OCD thing that only kicks in every once in a while.  He told his wife, ugh, just take it back.  Really?  He didn't even want to be tempted.  Didn't want to get involved.  No.  Didn't even want to be tempted.  He's like, just bring him back to the store.  I mean, I would love that, but I know that it's just dangerous.  It's going to be a problem.  It's going to be a problem.  I mean, some people just know.  And then I finally beat that level, and then I didn't want to play anymore.  Now that game's just done. 
[03:07:30]  I have more to do, but I don't know.  That was the challenge, I guess.  The most dangerous ones for me are the massive multiplayer online games.  Because if I get a game like, you know, Half-Life, and I play it, I'll play it until the end, and then I'm done with it.  I might revisit it, the online version, a couple of times, or Splinter Cell.  You play that, you're done with it.  But these games, you get on there, and there's no end to it.  See, there's no end game.  See, I, no.  I've got to mine more iron.  I have to mine more iron tonight.  What are you doing to mine iron now? 
[03:08:00]  I'm mining iron.  You survey the ground, and then you mine and collect the iron so you can use it as a component to build things.  Or, if you don't want to just sit and mine iron, and you want to go off and do other things,  you could set up a whole mining complex that will mine for you.  But, that has to be maintained, and paid for, and collected, and stored, and powered.  And, to power it, you need to build and buy a powered plant, which then has to be, you have to allocate money for that.  And, then your stores have to go in a house, or a factory, or a warehouse. 
[03:08:30]  And, then you build things, and you have to sell them on the...  I'm listening to you.  I'm actually...  It goes on and on.  And, then you have to explain, like, oh, no, no, no, the children's fingers are good for cleaning out the munitions.  They have small hands.  Small hands.  I am essential to the one.  I am essential to the Star Trooper.  To the Star Trooper.  Star Trooper.  That shows you how much I care about those games, but I can still learn to improv a little.  It's a nightmare, though.  I won't even attempt the online gaming, because I know I'm done. 
[03:09:00]  You just get engrossed.  Because, somehow, I need an ending.  No, there is no ending.  I know.  I don't know.  There's no end game.  I don't know how that would play out in my head.  I'm not even...  You know, I don't...  Just when you're going...  Like, say you go out after a certain enemy,  and you beat them,  but the battle is really rough.  Your weapons are just strong enough to kill them after almost dying yourself,  but you get that, and you go,  you know, if I get better weapons,  I could come back and just wipe the shit out of these people.  Then you upgrade. 
[03:09:30]  You get up a level.  You get better weapons,  but there's no reason to go back and kill those people that were so tough.  So you're on to killing another enemy that's a little tougher,  and you're in the same boat you were just in.  That's why there's no end game.  There's always something ahead that you have to do  that's equally as difficult as the thing you just did.  So it doesn't end.  No, I'm...  No.  No.  I don't know how that would...  I'm not kidding.  I don't know how that would play out.  Oh, you've got to try it.  No.  You have to set goals.  Set goals.  All right, Mr. Macro Maker. 
[03:10:00]  So what's the goal?  I'm going to get pussy.  He's the worst gamer ever.  He makes these things called macros.  Now, they're small programs that the game runs that you type in.  They run within the game.  So say you want to harvest iron.  You find the survey spot, and you would have to sit there and click sample, sample, sample,  or rest when you get too tired, and then after you're done resting, you can sample more.  He writes these programs so he can leave.  I'm sure the game is running right now as we speak. 
[03:10:30]  His macros are running the game for him, and he's making money, he's harvesting things,  he's killing things, all sitting here.  The game plays itself.  That's crazy.  Dude, there's these virtual worlds that are running themselves with your computers at home.  People aren't even playing.  You play a video game and then leave?  I'm not even...  I'm playing right now.  He's still playing.  I do the same thing with movies.  I got one running right now.  I'm not even going to watch it.  Who the fuck's the use of that?  It's stupid.  Like Ant was saying, you have to do all these tasks.  Joshua was still playing the game. 
[03:11:00]  Hello?  Big Kev?  Big Kev?  He still has to figure that stuff out before he leaves, though, and then he could go back  and check it out to see where he's at.  See, now when he comes back, he's collected so many things.  As far as saying goals, it's funny because with this stupid hot shots game, which is  a lot simpler than the games you guys are talking about, obviously, I'm like, all right,  I'll play until 11 o'clock.  I'll get myself to...  That game works.  I'll play until 11, and then that's it.  That's it.  Then I'll go out or do something. 
[03:11:30]  Next thing you know, it's one.  All right, I'll only get myself to 130.  Yeah.  And then it just never ends.  I don't like doing those things that Ant said and mining the ore and all that.  So what I do is I just get tons of money using macros.  And I just buy everything I need.  You buy everything you need instead of making it and actually getting points.  You know what the goal should be?  You keep playing until you can get a stole.  These suck.  Oh, boy.  I was going to say a stool and a rope, so I'm putting them together. 
[03:12:00]  Get a stole.  A stole.  You know what I mean.  You can wear it.  You can throw it around your shoulders.  Let's go to Ryan in Florida.  We're talking about Gamefly.com.  We'll get back to that in a second.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Hey, guys.  Games are good, man.  It gives all of us married spits.  We don't have to worry about the women so much, man.  You can just go play your game.  You don't have to worry about trying to get a piece of tail.  I have a great game for you.  How about getting the rowboat, bitch?  That's a fun one if you're married. 
[03:12:30]  Let's say hi to Ian in Massachusetts.  Now I have to make my getaway good.  That's right.  I have a throw-the-wife-overboard macro.  Let me mine for a fucking hot aerobics teacher.  Ian.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead, Ian.  Yeah, I was playing Splinter Cell.  I was hooked on that game five days straight, no sleep.  Splinter Cell's a great game, man.  Really was.  It really is a lot of fun.  I'm not into third-person shooters like that, but Splinter Cell's the only one that's really good. 
[03:13:00]  There's a lot of cool moves you could do.  You get up between the two walls and a lot of stealth.  It's not just run in there and shoot, and you can drop down on people, smash them.  You could sneak up, grab them by the neck, interrogate them, and then snap their neck or stab them or knock them out.  It's intense.  It's a good game.  I like games that have a lot of things to do.  Somebody brought up City of Heroes.  It just sucks.  I wasn't into it.  I tried it.  It's another one of these massive multi-online games, and there just isn't enough things to do. 
[03:13:30]  That's why Galaxies is cool, because a lot of people say it's monotonous or redundant, but there's so much to do.  There's like, if you just want to craft shit or mine stuff and sell it, you don't even have to battle at all.  If you just want to battle, and now with light speed, you're up in space.  You build ships.  You modify them until you really have a good kick-ass one.  So I like games where there's a lot to do.  I'm not one of those, just give me a controller that I can hit this key like eight billion times to shoot something. 
[03:14:00]  I like them complicated.  Jimmy, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  Oh.  Yeah.  Go buy a boat and rent a gun, man.  You're saying you're single, you have money, and you're playing fucking games until three o'clock in the morning?  At least Norton gets whores.  What the fuck is this?  What is three o'clock in the morning a no-fuck zone, my friend?  I'm doing just...  There's fucking after 3 a.m.?  Good point, Ant.  Thank you.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Jimmy, trust me.  I'm doing just fine. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I know, but still, man.  I mean, I live vicariously through your eyes.  I mean, I'm married.  Yeah, well, you want to live through Opecides?  You have to move to Ten Town.  I languish in Foursville, and occasionally I'll tap into Fivetown.  Foursville?  Let's just put it this way.  Jim's stories are exciting, and they're fun to listen to.  If I told my stories, you'd kill yourself.  Because they're just healthy and annoying.  The hot chick in Foursville. 
[03:15:00]  She's still only a four.  She's still only a four.  Occasionally, once in a while, I get lucky, and I take a ride into the village of Six.  But never Seventropolis.  No, Seventropolis is way too expensive.  And Ten Town, I mean, they actually divert any plane I'm on around it.  I'm not even allowed to fly over Ten Town.  All right, well.  You're on their no-fly list.  You get the point.  Video games are addicting.  Yes.  Gamefly.com, that's where we were. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, yeah, Gamefly.com.

[03:16:00]  That's Gamefly.com.  And you can put the slash XM after Gamefly.com.  Let them know where you heard it.  Gamefly.com.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  When we were driving in D.C., we saw a car next to us.  And my girlfriend looks down into the car, and there's a serious unit.  It's stuck to the windshield.  It's like a windshield-mounted thing.  And it was so big, we were laughing so hard at it, because it was just, it was giant. 
[03:16:30]  And it was taking up so much of the windshield that it was a hazard.  It was an absolute hazard to the people that were driving around this car.  And we could not stop looking or laughing at it.  Like, I had to drive next to the person to see how they could possibly drive with this huge piece of hardware right in their vision. 
[03:17:00]  Amazing, the people over there at Sirius actually crowing about this equipment.  That is just archaic and huge.  It probably also doubles as a windshield defroster in the winter, with the heat coming off the tubes in there.  It just keeps the windshield clean, so maybe they do have a plus.  Oh, that's classic.  Very nice.  I just got a serious unit.  Oh, that's the thing you're talking about?  No, dude, it was bigger than this, I swear. 
[03:17:30]  It was more horizontal than this one is vertical.  And it just took up the whole windshield.  And Faggot Hawk from OpieAnthony.net is all pissed off.  Sirius Radio's large piece of equipment.  We get it.  Get off the size of fucking Sirius units already.  Why?  They're big and it's funny.  They're big and they try to make it sound like they're new modern equipment and it's funny.  You ass shit. 
[03:18:00]  You know what?  You're getting banned.  There you go.  I'm banning you.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Stoppy, do you believe?  Will you bite the hand and feel?  Will you do a deal with news?  Off your knees.  Are you brave enough to see?  Do you want to change it? 
[03:18:30]  Nine and Snail's still doing it, huh, Ant?  On Sleepy Ass.  Sleepy Ass FM.  Nin.  It's Nin, dude.  All right.  I am better than you.  Wait.  I am better than your kids.  It's now linked.  Dot com.  Our new favorite site.  We're going to try to get the guy on the show tomorrow or the next day or something like that.  Look at that.  That's a scumbag. 
[03:19:00]  All right, Anthony, a couple things.  We've got to clean up some stuff here.  We've got a Russell Crowe story.  Oh.  Is there anything there, really?  No surprises.  Yeah, let's see.  I just don't know.  The guy, obviously, drunk.  Is that the problem?  Yeah, let's play.  Drunk and a little mad that his movie got horrid reviews.  Well, let's play the news story real fast to get everyone up to speed, and then we'll talk about it for a minute or two.  An Academy Award winning actor, Russell Crowe, is arrested early this morning at a Soho hotel.  Eyewitness News reporter, Carolina Tarazona, is joining us live now from Tribeca with more on the story. 
[03:19:30]  Eating Crowe today.  Well, Laurie, Russell Crowe is still here in the first precinct in lower Manhattan, and he's been charged with assault.  Police.  Oh, she can't speak.  No.  Russell Crowe.  Russell Crowe.  Russell Crowe.  Is she, like, Mayor Menino's daughter or something?  Elena?  Well, Laurie, Russell Crowe is still here in the first precinct in lower Manhattan, and he's been charged with assault.  Police say he was staying at the Mercer Hotel in Soho. 
[03:20:00]  He was in New York promoting his new movie, Cinderella Man, at about 4.20 this morning.  He apparently got into an argument with a hotel employee over a long-distance phone call.  Officials say he shrugged that hotel worker with the phone, and that worker was treated for minor injuries.  Now, Crowe is expected to leave the precinct sometime this morning.  He will be taken to Central Booking, where he will be arraigned.  God, we had a perfect opportunity for an assault on the media today.  Down there, I'm sure.  Yeah, Mercer Kitchen on Mercer Street.  We ate a little lunch there one day. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, right.  That's a real fancy hotel.  Someone showed me that.  Is it?  It's not like the Soho Grand.  Is it fancy schmancy?  Yeah, they say it's really highfalutin.  Highfalutin.  I think we got a little more on this story.  Russell Crowe, huh?  Boy.  Didn't show up for a PR gig the other day, because he's got bad ratings, I guess.  Bad reviews, yeah.  Bad ratings.  So, he's not happy.  No, and then he couldn't make a call to Australia.  I think that's what he got his temper up.  Steve's going to go over and bail him out later on. 
[03:21:00]  It'll be fine.  Yeah.  It'll be all right.  We'll just pull a couple bucks, get Russ out.  Here's what's going on.  Bail him out, Billy Boy.  It'll be a pretty good day, as a matter of fact.  Why don't you bail him out, Billy Boy?  Is that who that was?  Yeah, yeah.  Our favorite team?  That's the Billy and Steve show.  Hey, Billy Boy.  Yeah, that guy's just known to be really obnoxious, get drunk, screw everyone's girls, and have fights.  Gotta respect that.  Cinderella.  Cinderella little man got really bad reviews, so he decided to stop doing interviews and stuff for it.  And he's uptight because of that, and then he couldn't make a phone call.  A little argument with one of his co-stars, also. 
[03:21:30]  Really?  I don't know.  One of the guys that plays another fighter.  He kind of has a problem with him, says he wasn't a seasoned actor, and had some problems.  I don't know.  It just sounds like a little prick.  Blaming part of the failure of the movie.  What a dick.  He is a great actor, though.  You gotta give him that.  He is a great actor, Russell Crowe.  And the guy he hit with the phone just got a big raise, huh?  Sure did.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can't get hit by a phone by a celebrity and not really cash in on it.  But what? 
[03:22:00]  Guy couldn't make a long-distance call, and he throws the phone out at 4.30 in the morning.  It's kind of nice.  I kind of like that.  That's the way you should treat a hotel employee.  I'm an Oscar winner.  I want to call Australia.  Chop, chop, boy.  Move it.  All right, there's not much there, I guess.  They should hand you the phone with your number already dialed, because you're important  and you're thinking of acting.  Right.  You're a big man on campus.  BMOC, as I say.  Also last night, the Tony Awards.  Ooh.  Ah.  Who saw the Tony Awards? 
[03:22:30]  Hawk?  No.  You're usually up on these things.  Who saw the Tony Awards around here?  Ant?  Is that me?  Anyone?  No, I...  Wasn't me.  Oh, they were last night.  Darn it, I missed it.  Probably.  I forgot.  Probably huge news and talk about it on the Broadway channel here on XM.  Oh, very good.  I bet that's like the thing that's going down.  I bet you it was Christmas for the Broadway channel.  Might as well be.  Might as well be Christmas.  Uh-huh.  Well, Nathaniel put this together. 
[03:23:00]  People bombing at the 2005 Tony Awards.  He says people, but it's only just a couple here.  Well, they're people.  They're people.  How many?  Well, a few.  If he said persons, you would have...  Person plus two?  I guess you're right.  Three is people.  But it's a lot...  You know why I'm saying that?  Because I see a lot of Billy Crystal and just maybe one other...  Well, he has his one-man show, and apparently that won some awards.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the awards are for the Tonys. 
[03:23:30]  I think he won most likely to blow off another comic at a premiere.  Photo cock blocker?  Well, he didn't...  Oh, yeah.  No cameras.  No cameras.  All right.  Why don't we play the first clip?  Here's Billy Crystal.  Who do you play that?  Thank you and good evening.  I am thrilled to be here, and I also have an announcement.  I, too, am head over heels in love with Katie Holmes.  I'm in love.  I'm in love.  I'm in love.  Welcome to the 59th Annual Tony Awards, or as CBS calls them, CSI Broadway. 
[03:24:00]  He's killing.  He's killing.  Boy, a real bomb.  Good one clip there.  Picked the one with the applause breaks.  I'm sorry.  He wasn't bombing in the actual venue, but I just thought the joke stunk.  I shouldn't have...  Oh, well, he should be concerned about that.  Well, I'm killing in front of this crowd that I'm in front of, but I'm a little perturbed.  Nathaniel didn't enjoy my material.  That's right.  I thought you guys would think the jokes weren't that sweet and want to make fun of them. 
[03:24:30]  And not Nathaniel Lane, but the other fag Nathaniel.  That's me.  Well, why don't we try another one?  All right.  Another bomb.  He doesn't bomb.  I'm going to say that right now, so let's...  Oh, yeah.  No, according to Nathaniel, what does that say?  What does that say, Anthony?  What does that say, Anthony?  I can't read it.  The gleam off of Danny's smiling teeth.  The gleam, the sun reflecting off his huge smile.  Boy, how things turn fast around here. 
[03:25:00]  They sure do, Opie.  It says on this, people bombing at the 2005 Tony Awards.  People bombing.  Why is Golden Boy in there smiling?  Here's more of Billy Crystal bombing last night.  Now, I should point out that we'll be doing a few different things tonight, like all of  the songs from all the nominated musicals will be sung by Beyonce.  He sang everything at the Oscars.  In French.  He sang in French, yes.  Good place to play the crickets, even though you wouldn't hear them over the ruckus laughter 
[03:25:30]  and clapping.  I'd love to have a shitty set like that at the Tonys.  That's terrible.  This is awful.  How can he go on?  He's bombing if he's doing a eulogy and getting that response.  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Opie, can I see that CD for a sec?  No, no, don't show me the CD.  I want to hear more bombs.  This is good.  Yeah, maybe he slowly goes down the tubes.  And by the end, you forget that he was killing it.  That's right.  That's right.  Stan, there's a method to it.  Stan's good.  Here's more Billy Crystal bombing at the 2005 Tony Awards. 
[03:26:00]  Billy Crystal talking about Deep Throat, I guess.  It's the excitement of being in front of this live audience.  They laugh.  They cry.  It's unpredictable what happens.  It's their...  Why are you laughing?  There's a phone ringing, though.  Who the fuck farted?  Can I say why they're laughing?  Yeah, that was the whole problem that Billy Crystal had at his show with people's cell phones ringing.  Yes.  He had to actually leave the performance and come back, and the phone was ringing.  I'm sorry, I didn't know.  It's all right.  And me, to answer your other question. 
[03:26:30]  That has been brutal, dude.  Sorry, I get nervous.  I didn't get it.  You will.  Lady, is that your phone?  Or something else that you have with you that does that?  What jerk would bring a cell phone to the Tonys?  Oh, God, it's mine.  Sorry, I have to take this.  Hello?  Billy, it's Hugh.  The 1958 ring.  Hello, Hugh?  Hugh Jackman.  Hugh Pinero?  I know it's me, but who are you? 
[03:27:00]  Hugh Jackman.  Hugh Jackman.  Somebody help me.  Oh, you.  Hi.  Listen, I'm glad to show you.  For a second, I was worried it was deep throat.  You know, Harvey Fierstein.  Oh, hey, hey, huh?  There you go.  Bag joke.  It's a good joke.  Wow, he's bombing.  What a terrible set this is.  Wow, this reminds me of the Apollo.  Where's Sandman to shuffle out and hook him? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, the way they laugh and clap until you walk off to a standing ovation.  That's awful.  Daniel is really uncomfortable right now.  Why would he be uncomfortable?  Just because he has completely the wrong reaction to the...  This is good, because when he performs, he probably goes, wow, I was killing.  Thinking that killing is when they're silent.  Right.  And not saying anything.  He thinks he has a good set.  If he walks out, it's like Anne Frank's attic.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  They all just lay there in a small space.  All right, well, so far, no one else is getting beat up for bombing right now. 
[03:28:00]  No, that's a good one.  So far, three for three here.  Yeah.  Billy Crystal's killing.  Can I call you back?  Because, honestly, I'm right in the middle of the Tony Awards.  I know, Billy.  I'm not quite sure how to say this, because, well, you're the man.  But I'm actually hosting the Tony Awards tonight.  No, you're not.  Mate.  No, it's, you know, it's Sunday night.  I'm in a tux, and I'm happy to be a Tony nominee. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, well, I have a Tony.  A tiny.  I have a tiny.  Oh, how the hell?  Boy, if he isn't two different people.  How the hell is he Wolverine?  And that fag on Broadway.  He shaves off the beard.  He takes the blades out of his knuckles, and he tucks down that ear hair thing he does.  And all of a sudden, he's a song and dance man.  How do you know? 
[03:29:00]  Have you seen clips of him?  Who is he?  He plays that.  Boy from Oz.  He plays that fag.  What's his name?  The boy from Oz.  Bert Lahr?  No.  Oh.  It has nothing to do with Oz.  It has to do with, I guess, his love of Judy Garland.  Wow.  All right, well.  Alan.  Alan.  Alan.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Or is his last name Alan?  Alan Hunter.  Peter Allen.  Oh.  Peter Allen.  That's what he's playing?  The gay guy Peter Allen.  It's his life story on Broadway, and Hugh Jackman is playing him. 
[03:29:30]  A year ago.  And he does, win my baby, win my baby, Rio de Janeiro.  No?  Nothing?  Did it last night on the broadcast, I heard.  Did he?  Sure he did.  Look, I just know, because it's Hugh Jackman, and I'm a big X-Men fan, and, you know, he's  Wolverine.  Is that how you know?  And that's how I know.  I swear.  That big gloved hand is pointing at you, so it doesn't get your blood on it. 
[03:30:00]  Well, we better keep Anthony happy today.  Ooh.  This could be the gayest song ever.  A really long intro.  Is it?  How do you know?  I saw the show.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Did you really?  I did.  How was it? 
[03:30:30]  It was good.  Do you have to bring a dildo to put on the seat, or do they leave one there in the theater  for you?  Awful.  This is when the whole chorus line shuffles out in their tattered robes and slippers.  A little dog yelping behind them.  The dog smells that something is wrong because they're not being fed as often.  I'd love to feed you, but I'm just too tired to get out of bed.  And then there's a whole other group of people.  They come out on stage dressed as big tees, and then they slowly leave the stage so there's  only one left.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:31:00]  So, Hugh Jackman, does he have to get romantic with another man on stage?  Yes, he does.  He does?  Is there kissing?  Uh, I don't remember if it went that far.  It was a year ago.  Does he, whoosh, the blades out of his knuckles and shove him up a man's ass?  If only.  If only.  Wow.  He's a real actor.  You didn't know that Hugh Jackman was, uh, you ever see X-Men?  Opie?  You never saw X-Men? 
[03:31:30]  No.  Come on.  It's good, Opie.  What's the matter with you?  All right, I'll watch it.  You gotta see X-Men.  That's right.  X-Men 2.  When does this song start?  Darn this music now.  Oh, you were right, Kev.  Is this Hugh Jackman doing it?  Yep.  My baby's not me, I go to Rio.  Is there a home?  Miami, oh.  Oh, good Lord.  Fucking musicals are horrendous. 
[03:32:00]  Aren't they just bad?  Who could enjoy that?  Well.  That is terrible.  It's terrible.  Is it?  Is it really?  Yeah.  I hate me, my baby.  When my baby.  Fuck you.  When my baby.  God, is that just flamboyant and horrendous.  Well, let's see if Mario Cantone bombed at the Tonys last night.  All right.  Old friend of the program.  Mario Cantone.  Tone uber gay.  Bombed on his special.  Bombing.  Did he?  Oh, it was terrible.  Let's hear him here.  His show got bad reviews.  One man showed it, yeah. 
[03:32:30]  Mario and I are so happy to be here tonight.  Who's with him?  To be presenting this very prestigious.  Ben.  The chick from Will and Grace with the bad voice.  Oh, right, right.  She does the Eminem commercials.  Wait, is she one of the four stars?  Yeah.  Okay, no, I'm just saying.  She's the sassy broad.  I did the Tonight Show with her.  I just, I don't know.  Oh.  Aren't you doing the Tonight Show soon?  Next Monday.  Next Monday?  You're doing the Tonight Show next Monday, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Supposedly.  Proud.  It's me and Hilary Duff and Joe Perry. 
[03:33:00]  Very nice.  Really?  Good lineup.  Category.  The nominees for Best Supporting Rap Actress in a Drama are Queen Latifah, Little Eve, Kim,  and Foofy Foof.  Yeah.  Honey, I'm not sure that's the category.  All right.  Let's try it again.  All right.  Go for it.  The nominees for Best Bookie in my family are my mother, my father, my cousin Victor, 
[03:33:30]  and Joe DeBarber from Flushing.  All right.  Okay.  I'll take it from here.  All right, Nathaniel.  One out of seven's not bad.  But that got laughs.  It shouldn't have.  Yeah.  It's awful.  See, he comes from an Italian family in Boston.  He's been doing that bit for a long time.  Do you suck dicks?  And he goes from faggy to acting overly macho, but he doesn't sound overly macho when he's 
[03:34:00]  trying to be overly macho.  I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the  goddamn comment, Curtis, that he gave him a reach around.  I'm just not a fan of the...  Enough with the flamboyant gay thing.  Yeah.  And even the ironic masculine...  Who cares?  All right.  Let's go to...  Who fucking cares?  Nathan Lane bombing, according to Nathaniel.  Thank you.  In light of recent events, I have a confession to make.  I am the son of Deep Throat. 
[03:34:30]  And like the Washington Post expose, I too was conceived in a parking garage.  But enough about me.  You know, it's really crazy backstage.  I gotta tell you, just before the show started, Elaine Stritch got into a fight with a stagehand  and then inexplicably started squeezing Hugh Jackman's buttocks.  And by the time they sedated her, she had punched out two cops and was holding Norbert Leo Butts hostage.  Threatening to kill one of his three names. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  I have no idea who they're talking about.  You know, I hate when...  He should fucking fall on a sword.  You know, I hate when people use award shows for political means, but I do have a message for Saddam Hussein.  And for the love of God, switch to boxers.  I'm here tonight.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  That shot of Saddam Hussein is one of the funniest shots in recent memory.  Oh, with his sack?  With his droopy underpants.  With his fruit of balloons.  His droopy underpants. 
[03:35:30]  With his big ball sack.  His big Iraqi ball sack.  Big fucking big uncut gift.  Unclipped dictator.  Shoving that into your woman while he fucking tightens things on your fingers for information.  What a creep.  All right, Nathaniel, that was great.  Peter Allen died of the Hiv, right?  And did they portray that in the Broadway show?  Yes.  How does Hugh Jackman show that he's got the Hiv?  I believe he wears a scarf. 
[03:36:00]  A scarf?  Jesus.  The scarf of the Hiv.  He doesn't wear a robe, though?  I don't remember.  He wears a quilt.  There we go.  And then is there a big donation portion of the program where you can give?  Pass along.  I know that's big on Broadway.  Saddam Hussein and his underpants.  Oh, there's the picture.  It's just the best.  That's everyone waking up in the morning.  Just, ah, well, fucking.  By the way, that was a very unceremonious exit from the studio by Nathaniel.  Yeah, he's kind of bummed out.  He just slinked out.  No, I said thanks, and he walked out. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, some days you're making the news with a great appearance and a reporter firing.  That's right.  And the next few, you don't know what the word bum means.  Other days, you're wrecking the show.  All right, Big Kev, you saw Batman, huh?  I did.  He really is annoyed.  Oh, he really is.  He really is.  Oh, he wanted to smack me in the face in that last one.  Of course he did.  He tried.  He actually gave us good radio, just not the way he wanted it.  He certainly did.  If you want to feel better about yourself, it's a little more than Dan gave us. 
[03:37:00]  Big Kev saw Batman.  How was it?  The new Batman.  I don't give a shit.  Remarkable.  The new Batman.  Yes.  Everyone's psyched for this.  He's one of, what, 200 people that have seen the movie so far?  200 people, yeah.  I was the first audience, in the first audience to see it.  But wasn't there, um...  I just could care less about fucking Batman.  Why?  The fucking guys that get to play it.  This one's this time.  It's like, just get one guy who's good.  This one guy.  I don't know what happened was, the franchise died.  It was dead.  No, it was killed. 
[03:37:30]  It was killed.  I mean, when was the last one?  Like, seven years ago?  Six years ago?  Something like that?  Was it really?  No, six or seven years ago, and they gave up on it, but then you got, you know, all these  movies coming out now, so obviously they gotta bring it back.  No wackiness or zaniness in this at all.  Nope.  This is cool.  Not one bit.  The beginning of him being Batman.  Yep.  That sounds very cool.  A lot darker, right?  A lot darker.  Who's the bad guy in it?  Who's the criminal?  Uh, it's, uh, Ray Shah Gould.  Liam Neeson's in it, right?  Liam Neeson is in it.  Uh, Ken Wanatabe is in it. 
[03:38:00]  Uh, Cillian Murphy from 28 Days Later is playing the Scarecrow.  He's fantastic.  Well, who, who's the, who's the bad guy?  Who I was supposed to be, uh, the Scarecrow Robin.  Yeah, that's right.  You know when he was saying that?  Tell him, Fred.  They were casting me as a Scarecrow Robin.  Right before Batman and Robin came out, they were saying that, and then that was the end  of that.  Shut up, Fred.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Get your Fartman movie made, why don't you?  Yeah, it's absolutely, it, the new Batman movie is absolutely a real, it's, you totally  believe everything about it.  It's not like Tim Burton, there's no, absolutely, all stylized, Gotham looks like some crazy 
[03:38:30]  madman dream.  I like Tim Burton, though.  Something out of a Tim Burton movie.  I like him, too, but this is, Gotham looks like a real place, and, you know, everything  is plausible.  You know, the entire, everything in the film is, with, you know, some, not over the top  or wackiness or something like that.  None of that.  None of it.  That's cool.  Where's Robin?  No Robin.  How is he not in it?  Robin was in every Batman ever, and they put him in one of the eight movies.  Maybe that's why the franchise eats ass.  Why Robin was so great? 
[03:39:00]  Burt Ward with that big bulge?  Yes, he was.  Burt Ward was the worst.  Kapow!  Kapow!  Yeah, that whole Batman take, the TV series one, was awful.  I was entertained by that, like, when I was seven.  And then by eight, you're watching going, this is bullshit.  That would have been a great movie if they had that awful narrator and the things.  Meanwhile, look, pow, bam, bad.  Kablonk.  They show all of his training.  They show how he gets all of the weaponry and vehicles and all the rest of it. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And then the cave and everything.  It's fantastic.  Who's the old guy?  Alfred?  Alfred.  That's Michael Caine.  Michael Caine is Alfred.  They changed Alfred's, too?  They just fucking changed everybody in these movies.  I can't get into it.  Because it's a separate entity.  I don't care what it is.  It's the same character, and it stinks.  This has nothing to do with the other movies.  Christian Bale is Batman and looking like he knows what he's doing.  And he's got a little psycho behind his eyes, and it's perfect.  I just hate the way they did that.  Really?  Well, I like Tobey Maguire.  They got Spider-Man.  That's the guy who's Spider-Man. 
[03:40:00]  That's who you relate to as Spider-Man.  You know, the X-Men, they keep changing the characters.  Hugh Jackman's got to play Wolverine.  Patrick Stewart's got to play the other guy.  I mean, why do they just keep switching them?  And you'd be like, this fucking blows.  That's not going to happen again.  Now, Christian Bale is signed for three movies.  Hawkeye.  And then he's going to jump on a horse and break his back, I hear.  What happened to him?  No, that awful new Superman.  We'll deal with that.  Because Hawkeye always gives you these great notes with no information.  Alfred died.  Well, I don't care.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:40:30]  Jeez.  This is part of his training.  We're trying to toughen him up.  A little to watch.  All right.  Anyway, so you loved the movie.  Yeah, it was fantastic.  You really should go see it immediately.  Oh, I will definitely see the new Batman.  Immediately.  I saw some stuff also about Saw II.  Saw II?  Yeah, the sequel's coming.  I liked the first one, except for, what's his name?  Danny Glover.  Danny Glover.  He was in it, right?  Mm-hmm.  I get him and the other guy mixed up.  And you have Morgan Freeman. 
[03:41:00]  Morgan Freeman.  I said something really awful.  You almost did.  I saw you.  You ran up to that mic.  Three different ones I can think of in a second.  Morgan Freeman is, uh...  One begins with a K.  One begins with a mighty.  One begins with a mighty.  Oh, Mike. 
[03:41:30]  Holy shit.  You are awful.  She really is.  Morgan Freeman's in the Batman movie.  Oh, he is.  Fantastic.  All right.  Thank you.  What other superhero movies coming out, though?  There's the Fantastic Four.  Yeah, which is going to be a bomb.  I didn't like the trailers.  That looks kind of awful.  How do they look?  Do they look like the characters?  A little too CGI-ish, I think. 
[03:42:00]  Michael Ticklis looks like he's a battered-dipped piece of fish.  Really?  Yeah, it's terrible.  What's wrong with the Hulk when that movie came out?  It was too much CGI.  It looked too CGI, you know?  Too much Ang Lee.  Too fake.  I liked it, though.  I've got to be honest.  I liked Hulk more than I thought I would.  Oh, yes.  The music already?  I just...  Did this show fly by today?  Or what?  It sure did, Anthony.  It sure did.  Ridiculous.  Because he should be calling us on 202 while we're in the 2-1-2.  We won't...  It'll be the greatest call ever. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  Do we have time to play what did we learn on the O.P. Anthony show?  It was extremely educational today.  I want to thank Big Kev for stopping by.  Drew Curtis from Fark.com.  He had a great appearance today.  Let's say hi to Chandler.  Chandler, sorry.  Chandler, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, I learned that once in a while, Jimmy gets a ride to the Village of Six, but mostly  stays in Forrestville.  Forrestville for Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Snatchcrust.  What's going on, guys? 
[03:43:00]  I don't know how one began with K, but the other one has to begin with Mighty.  Can't be M.  Today I learned...  Unless no one gets the joke.  Fucking animal.  Go ahead, Snatchcrust.  I love it.  Hey, today I learned that Caster's children who swim with dolphins are referred to as Puddin'  Head.  Puddin' Head.  Puddin' Head.  Let's say hi to Tyler in North Carolina.  Line up.  Tyler, go.  Tyler, go.  Hey, Tyler.  Dude from North Carolina. 
[03:43:30]  Whatever your name is, ass.  Everyone say hi.  All right, no one.  Bye-bye.  All right, Mike from San Diego.  Today I learned that Oscar Schindler's Jews ripped off George Lucas.  And I learned that I should write a report on bombing.  And really groating.  Any nipples on the Batman uniform?  No.  Okay, good.  A lot of people are asking if there were nipples on the Batman uniform, which fagged up the  other Batman movies.  Joel Schumacher fagged up the other movies. 
[03:44:00]  Joel Schumacher fagged it up with the nipples.  No?  No nipples.  Good.  No.  Glad to hear it.  I like that one right there.  Go to that one.  I learned...  Did you read this one?  I hope not.  I learned.  You'll be in the Anthony show.  Ah, bullshit's over with.  All right, let's tear that up.  I gotta get out of here and suck a dick.  No, you gotta...  Oh, wait, we're still on.  Sorry.  I thought the mic were off. </pre>
