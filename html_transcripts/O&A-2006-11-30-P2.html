<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Rich Voss and Ari Shafir, with Joe Rogan as a recurring guest, was a raucous and wide-ranging affair.  The show opened with a studio performance by the band Octane (Brian Bortnick, Bob Perilas, and Jordan Demarest), whose "badass" rock and roll music impressed the hosts.  Discussion centered on the band's struggles to get a record deal, mirroring the challenges faced by comedians.  This led to anecdotes about the comedy circuit, experiences in cities like Philadelphia, the "Last Comic Standing" competition, dealing with club owners and agents, and the challenges of performing for different audiences, including black audiences, and navigating racial dynamics in comedy.  The hosts also discussed the role of the internet in the music industry and  had a lengthy, vulgar discussion about drug legalization, focusing on marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and salvia divinorum, with a caller providing a teacher's perspective.  The segment also featured humorous suggestions for a reality show about hecklers and anecdotes about comedians like Brian Holtzman and Patrice O'Neal, and a discussion about celebrities like P. Diddy navigating public life.

Rogan's appearances throughout the show were punctuated by crude humor, including jokes about bodily functions and blowjobs.  He extensively discussed his experiences with medical marijuana in California, highlighting the ease of access and humorous anecdotes about his doctor.  This sparked a broader debate about marijuana legalization across the US, comparing California's approach to that of more conservative states, and drawing controversial comparisons between anti-marijuana propaganda and historical anti-Semitic propaganda.  A female caller, Wendy from Maryland, even suggested Rogan run for president.  The discussion included details about various marijuana products and their effects,  as well as the inconsistent quality of unregulated marijuana in other states.

Rogan also fielded numerous caller questions about the UFC, covering topics such as fighters with unusual physical attributes, the effectiveness of punches versus kicks, the evolution of fighting styles, and recommendations for martial arts gyms.  He discussed his upcoming show, *Inside the UFC*, his views on social Darwinism, and a Comedy Central pilot, *The Best Man*, along with the challenges of working within network constraints. The compensation differences between UFC and boxing fighters were also discussed.  He described a “Fight Club” he’d encountered in San Diego, and mentioned online videos of unregulated violent fights.  Rogan also described his new tattoo throughout the segment.   He discussed his clothing preferences (designer brands), his stand-up comedy shows at Caroline's and Governors, and his UFC commentary work.  A caller who waited two hours on hold was rewarded with free tickets to a Rogan show. The show also included vulgar jokes and anecdotes about Atlantic City prostitutes, with derogatory language used. Voss contributed a racially offensive joke about Robin Givens.  The promotion of Rogan's future appearances on the show, including an eggnog drinking contest, and plugs for his website and stand-up shows were also included.  A discussion about a slow round of golf led to a discussion of a Christian parody website and a caller's request for a UFC sound effect ("pap pap pap") which Rogan provided.

[00:23:30]  You know what I mean  Are you trying to say  They're more animalistic  No no no  No not at all  What I'm trying to say  They can have a good time  Because they don't have to  Get up early for work  So they can  I was doing a black crowd  At a club in New York  And there was a good set going  And I go  How am I going to sabotage this  And I started trashing  Sharkton  In front of a black audience  I don't know why  I just started trashing them  And some big big black lady 
[00:24:00]  She had to be 500 pounds  Started booing me  Don't want to  Booing  And I go  Bitch as fat as you are  You should be mooing  Right  And they come out  I went  Good night thank you  But they are the best audiences  If they like you  Because you can be real with them  Either way  There's no silence  I used to do a lot of  Black clubs in Boston  Because you know  When I first started out in Boston  I couldn't get any gigs  In the city  All my gigs were like  In bars and stuff  Outside of Boston  Anything that you get paid for  Like in town  Like the main clubs 
[00:24:30]  Where like Nick's Comedy Stop  And like the Comedy Connection  I couldn't get any of that  Because I was dirty  You know  So I used to work  All these outside rooms  And I used to work  A couple black clubs  In Medford  Dorchester  And dude  When you killed  You fucking killed  You killed  They would die laughing  It was like  The biggest laughs ever  But when you bomb  Man it was death  They like  I was doing a club  Called Terminal D  It was like the first  Black club in New Jersey  I mean it was  And I was hosting a show  And this black comic went on  And he was bombing so bad 
[00:25:00]  They were booing him  Giving him the bell  And everything right  So before he ends his show  He goes  You know what  I worked a white club  Last night  And they were so much better  To me than my own people  Fuck you  And walked off  And I went back on  Because I'm a host  I'm going you know  I'm not going to lie  I was at the white club  And they didn't like him here  And that's the shit  Black people love  They just went nuts  They just went nuts  It's like anything else  You get to feel their vibe  You get used to it  I know a lot of guys 
[00:25:30]  Like Dice has gone up  On Fat Tuesdays  In the comedy store  I started in black rooms too  Like a little bit in LA  Because the white rooms  Wouldn't have me  Yeah  Just because  You know  Because you're a show  Well I wasn't any good  So black was the first ones  That were like  Put me on  Like real shows  You know what's good  When you're doing  A mixed  That's good  When you're doing  A regular club  And there's a mixed audience  Because if you're doing  Racial edgy stuff  The black people will laugh  And then white people  Will go  Well they're laughing  We can laugh  Yeah it's that moment  Of like the look over  And say okay  They're cool  So I can laugh now  You know 
[00:26:00]  Because if it's all white  They're like  You know  I can't  You know  Do you think  They're going to lose  Their fucking job  Or they're just  A white guilt  I wonder what  The Kramer thing  Is going to do  For comedy  I wonder if that's  Going to change shit  It might fuck things up  With Jamie Masada  Saying he's going to ban  That's going to change  And how many times  Do people say nigger  I mean how often  Does that get said  Mooney  Said he won't say it anymore  He's used it  Easily over a million times  Mooney's just getting  A little bit more publicity  He's saying it  I would say it on stage  Oh please hold me  Hold me please  I'm saying it  I would say it more on stage 
[00:26:30]  If I had windows  To roll up  And a car door to lock  You know  Bring one on with you  Bring a window  You know what  I'm worried about  Is those two fucking  Douchebags that were  Heckling  Those guys  Bottom line  Everyone who heckles  Is a fucking douchebag  There's no cool  Enlightened  Really nice  Friendly hecklers  Those guys are assholes  Any guy screaming shit out  Those guys are pieces of shit  They're interrupting the show  That said  Those guys are suing  And they're suing  The laugh factory  What are they suing for?  They got Gloria Allred  She's a cunt 
[00:27:00]  A cunt?  She's the worst  She is  She just looks  Her publicity  For sure  She won't let them do interviews  Unless she gets an interview too  What if they started a show  And here's the idea for this show  What if they started a show  Called Heckled  Just like Punk'd  And they set up hidden cameras  In a comedy club  And they have these two douchebags  And they sit in the audience  And they put a little something  In their ear  And they have comics  Feed them lines  And they try to fuck up comics  They get like some road guy  Some road guy  That's got like  You know  One  You know  Live at Gotham credit  Or something like that  And he's  You know 
[00:27:30]  Headlining in Bettendorf, Iowa  On a Thursday  And they just  Fuck this guy's world up  That'd be fun to watch  That'd be fun to watch  That'd be fun to watch  That's possible, right?  Could you imagine if they  Ted you  Imagine if you  Were in the fucking audience  With like a fake mustache  On an outfit  So they couldn't recognize you  And you just  Got to  You got to ruin  That'd be great  I mean, come on  And you guys would know too  What to not talk back  Like, oh, where are you from?  Silence  Well, I mean  But that would be dependent  On them talking back to you  But just to be able  To yell shit out  I mean, to fuck up 
[00:28:00]  I mean, how many times  Have you seen a bad comic  On stage  You just felt like  I could just ruin this guy  If I wanted to  Oh, yeah  Me and Patrice go back and forth  If he's in the audience  And I'm on stage  We'll start going  Yeah, people do that  At the store all the time  Don Barris, you know  We'll do that all the time  Brian Holtzman  We'll always  Heckle Holtzman  You know  Or me and Bonnie  We'll do that  The bedroom  I said to her the other night  I go, keep it up  I'm not going to  Clean your back off  She goes, that little bit  Will evaporate  Fucking Brian Holtzman  If you've never seen 
[00:28:30]  You have to see this guy  He's hilarious  I just sit and watch him  In amazement  On how out of his mind  And funny he is  He's fucking crazy  Brian Holtzman  Is the guy who's a regular  At the comedy store  In Los Angeles  Very rarely does he  Go anywhere else  He actually works full time  He used to work for U.S. Air  I don't know if he's still  Working for them  Does he?  Who does he work for now?  Does he have a full time job  Or did he get fired?  I'm pretty sure he's a meter maid  A meter maid?  Whoa  Meanwhile, he's one of the  Funniest comics in L.A.  He's got a joke on Susan Smith 
[00:29:00]  Remember Susan Smith?  That chick  Who drowned her kids?  He goes, ladies and gentlemen  I heard those were bad kids  I heard they sat  Right in front of the TV  They didn't put  Their fucking blocks away  They were always  Spilling their milk  They will not be missed  I heard Stanhope  Stanhope had him open  At the improv forum out there  Yeah  And he was out of his element  So he wasn't on his game  Unlike the improv  He's got to be in a dark, dark room  So the best thing about the comedy store  Is the spotlight hits you  You don't see shit in the audience  You don't see anybody's face  I don't see one row back 
[00:29:30]  That's it  And he can just be himself there  And play with the microphone  And play with his clothes  And just go off into his weird  Little Holzman world  He is fucking funny  That's what we were talking about  Earlier before  Certain comics  You'll walk in a room  I gotta watch this fucking guy  It's, you know  Cause you never know  What's gonna come out  He's the saddest one to me  Because that guy should be huge  I mean, I've known Brian  For eight, nine, ten years now  I mean, I've known him  Ever since I was at the comedy store  I mean, maybe a year after  I was at the comedy store  He started going there  And he's  He's always been fucking hilarious 
[00:30:00]  He's always people's favorite  Yeah, comics favorite  He's a real comics comic  Yeah, cause you don't know  Like if he's gonna  Go over  I've seen him  And rush the crowd  Well, he got knocked out  By Martin Lawrence's bodyguard  Yeah  Martin Lawrence's bodyguard  Was in the audience  And Martin Lawrence  Was heckling Brian Holtzman  And Brian Holtzman  Starts screaming  I'm a performer  I'm a performer  You're a performer  You're fucking heckling me  You motherfucker  And he got off stage  And went towards  Martin Lawrence  And Martin Lawrence's bodyguard 
[00:30:30]  Knocked him out  Just stepped up  Blam  Knocked him out  In the face  Show over  Holtzman goes  Heels over shoulders  Falls back into some tables  And that was the end  Of the fucking show  That's so funny  These black  You ever see some black comics  They have an entourage  Of like three bodyguards  Yeah  This and that  Like I know  Seinfeld walks around  By himself  Right  Chris walks around  By himself  Yeah  You know  But then you get these guys  That did two TV shows 
[00:31:00]  Like you said  And all of a sudden  They got guys  With walkie-talkies  Well I think  If they're going to black clubs  They probably need it man  I mean there's a lot  Of haters out there  Would you like to be  Chris Tucker  Walking into a black club  By yourself  Fuck that  You got a point  Fuck that  And you know  You're not walking  Into some nice restaurant  By yourself  You know  You're walking  Into a club  You know  You're going to  I mean you've heard  Stories about like  P. Diddy  And notice I called him  P. Diddy  Not Puff Daddy  He's not Puff Daddy  Anymore  He threw  Some dude threw money 
[00:31:30]  In his face  And people got shot  And shit happens man  Oh that was that  Law and Order episode  I bet  That's what that was  Based on  Yeah it was based on that  They always do that  They rip shit  Over the headlines  All the time  Yeah  But he went to some club  And I think he was  With Jennifer Lopez  At the time  And some guy  Got in his face  And I got more money  Than you nigga  And he threw  Like a wad of hundreds  In his face  And the guy he was with  Shot somebody  And he got fucking crazy  I would have been  On the ground  Picking up those bills  You know what man  You can't always floss  You can't always just go  You got to know  Where to go  And where not to go 
[00:32:00]  P. Diddy heckle me  I was doing  He had a club called  Really  Well he had a club  Called Justin's  It was  So it was a one night  Of a black show  In New York  So I was doing a spot  There on the show  And it was going well  In the beginning  And then all of a sudden  I just started losing  I mean you know  I lost  And I started bombing  Right  And then I heard  In the back  The siren  You know  From Apollo  Like get off  Right  And I don't know  Who said it  And I'm on stage  Going  You know what  Fuck you  Giving me the  So I go  Do you know  What I've accomplished  In life  I'm a good dad

[00:33:30]  Really great about racist humor  And then other times  She'll be just a total  Cunt about it  But she loved it  Oh I said to her  Sweet  I remember saying  This was just  Half Indian and half black  I didn't mean to  I go what  What tribe are  I go to her  What tribe are you from  Right  And I meant  Oh my god  I meant on the Indian side  Right  Yeah that was a lot of fun  Man that's a good club  That was  Me and my buddy  I think other than you  We're like the only people  That got that right away  Because me and my buddy  Both started laughing  Like as soon as you said that  And you sat there  And you're like 
[00:34:00]  Oh fuck  That was pretty good  And like the rest of the audience  Even my wife  They're like huh  Yeah I was going to make  A new CD from that week  But I just didn't feel  Like that  Minneapolis  You've been there right  No I haven't been  I'm going though  Cool city man  Yeah I've heard  The downtown  They have a statue downtown  Of Mary Tyler Moore  Right downtown  By the Macy's  So late at night  I drove and jerked off on it  Because I always wanted to fuck her  Right and that's the closest I could get to  Was me to jerk off on the statue  Hold on  A statue of Mary Tyler Moore  I have two problems with that  What's the first one  What's the second one  Fuck the first one  The second one is 
[00:34:30]  You always had a thing  For Mary Tyler Moore  She was hot  Are you crazy  When  Dude back in the day  Pre-Lou Grant show  Even when she was  Laurie Petty  On the fucking show  With Dick Van Dyke  Dude she was hot  She was super hot  On Dick Van Dyke  She was gorgeous  Yeah  You guys were idiots  And what's this  We're idiots  You were 12 years old  Whoa whoa whoa  Don't you like tank girl  You fucking homo  That's different  Because she's hot  Okay  Alright what's the second problem  What's the first one  Jerking off on a statue  Yeah what are you going to do 
[00:35:00]  What's the big fucking deal  You ever jerk off on a magazine  Yeah  Same shit  There's not people around  Let's take that guy in Vegas  Alright  Terrell in Vegas  Go ahead buddy  Hey what's up  What's up dude  Nothing much  Hey I wanted to ask you  What was going on  Well anyway  How you felt about  The government trying to ban  Salvia to Moore  Is it  Are they trying to ban it  I know they're trying to ban it  Here in Vegas  It's all over the news  Like they're trying to say  It has dangerous properties  And that kids are using it  As a second way to get high  They're comparing it to marijuana a lot 
[00:35:30]  Yeah  Obviously they're two  Completely different substances  Well it's a pretty serious psychedelic  It's kind of weird that it's legal  There was another drug that was legal  That's even more powerful  It's still legal technically  Which is called 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine  5-MeO-DMT  Which you should be able to get online  And just order it  And it's about a million times more powerful than mushrooms  Which is legal  Which is illegal rather  And this salvia divinorum  Is I know they tried a long time ago  Like a couple years ago 
[00:36:00]  To make it illegal  And it didn't get passed  You could still buy it at head shops  And it's kind of crazy  Online and stuff  Yeah it's way more powerful than marijuana  Way more powerful than  I mean  It's an out-of-body experience  When you smoke it  You have these really intense  Psychedelic experiences  What do you get it from?  What is it?  It's salvia divinorum  It's a plant  And you smoke it through a bong  And it's a psychedelic plant  Is it new?  Was that that  CSI?  It's been around for thousands of years  It was a CSI episode with that shit  Yeah  We were doing it out in the desert  Were they?  Yeah  That might have been mescaline 
[00:36:30]  No no they smoked it  They had to smoke it  Oh okay  Then it might have been salvia  Yeah it's a  Well you know what man  There's no reason to make any of these things illegal  The problem is  When people find out that that's legal  They go  Well how come that one's legal  And marijuana's not  And then it makes things tricky  So they have to try to make things illegal  So that they don't have to make marijuana legal  It's  They're in a real bad situation  Where you know  Basically they're still running around saying  That Santa Claus is real  You know  I mean that's what  By making marijuana illegal  They're saying Santa Claus is real  They're saying something ridiculous 
[00:37:00]  But your point about making marijuana illegal  And you had some good points before  When they were in  You know we were talking  But where do you draw the line  Do you make cocaine illegal  Do you make heroin illegal  I think everything should be legal  This is what I think  I think if you're fucking dumb enough to do heroin  You should be able to do heroin  I think  I believe in the laws of  I believe in social Darwinism  And I think we should have real education  And people should really know  What's legal and what's not legal  And I think if you're going to have drugs  Like Valium and alcohol  And all these other different prescriptions 
[00:37:30]  That are available  You should also have heroin  You should also have cocaine  And tax them through the fucking roof  Tax them heavily  And use that money for treatment centers  And let people know  What's good for you  And what's bad for you  But when you say  If you're dumb enough to get it  Okay there's alcoholics  That are brilliant  Okay  They didn't set out to become alcoholics  They drank alcohol  It was legal  It was social  So you think alcohol should be illegal?  No no  But I'm saying  I'm saying  You can't say  Only dumb people 
[00:38:00]  If you get addicted  Dumb people  Okay  Well alcoholism is a little bit different  Because I think people  Even heroin  I mean heroin  Apparently  If you smoke heroin once  Or shoot it once  You're probably gone  Right?  Most people  I don't know  It takes a couple times  Well crack and heroin  Crystal meth  All these different things  But we should know that  There should be  The lies that they tell us  About marijuana  Don't serve them  In the truths  They tell about crystal meth  Or the truth  They tell about real problem drugs  And if you think  That people should have 
[00:38:30]  Free reign to drink alcohol  Whenever they want  Which I do  If you think people  Have free reign  To swallow a thousand  If you want to fucking swallow  A thousand sleeping pills  And die  You should be able to  I mean you should be able  To do whatever the fuck  You want to do  But we should be honest  About what the effects  Of these things are  That's what I think  And I think  And if you're going to have  A society where  These drugs  Like Valium  Or any of these  Other crazy drugs  Are legal  You should have  Everything legal  Everything should be legal  I mean we're adults  Who is one grown adult  To tell you 
[00:39:00]  What to do  And what not to do  With your life  Or your body  As long as you're a grown adult  Keep it away from children  For sure  And educate everybody  It's going to affect  People that don't use it  For a while  It'll affect  It'll affect them  What do you mean  What do you mean  Well first of all  If it's legal  The whole crime aspect  Is bullshit  Because there'll still be crime  Because whether it's legal  Or not  People still don't have money  When they're addicted  So they're going to  Still rob and steal  That's a good point  So the whole crime aspect  Do you think more people  Would be addicted  If it was legal  Yeah you know why  Because if it's social  If it's okay at a party 
[00:39:30]  To put out a plate of cocaine  A person that's not as educated  At that age  And kids at 15 and 16  Think they're invincible  No matter how educated they are  They still think they're invincible  But they can still get it  There's no shortage of cocaine  And the real problem is  The cocaine they're getting  Is all cut with speed  And all kinds of other shit  At least if cocaine was legal  You'd get cocaine  You'd get real cocaine  Okay but here's the difference  With that  You say they can still get it  But the person  That doesn't  Isn't sure whether  They want to do it  Or this or that  They're not going to go out 
[00:40:00]  And hunt for it  Okay  That person that's not sure  Maybe I should  Maybe I shouldn't  If it's right there  And acceptable  It's easier for them to do  Maybe  Well you know  You counter that with education  I think bottom line  Is first thing  All plants should be legal  All of them  Whether it's salvia divinorum  Whether it's marijuana  Even cocaine  If you eat coca leaves  Coca leaves aren't dangerous at all  It's no more dangerous than coffee  The way it's eaten in Peru  The way they chew it  They chew the coca leaves  They actually get vitamins  And minerals from coca leaves  And it's a better buzz  Than caffeine is 
[00:40:30]  And it's not bad for you  It's a synthetic processed version  Of cocaine that's cut  With speed  And all that other shit  That's where it becomes dangerous  Well cocaine  You know good coke  Everybody says it's cut with speed  It's speed  If you're smoking it  Or shooting it  The speed is gone  Usually  You cook it out  And you got pure coke  Well you're going hardcore here  Well but that's what it leads to  Which fox is taking to another level  If you're shooting it  Whoa  Well when you got that needle  In your cock  Well I don't know  It's such a debatable thing  And there's no  It's that legalizing  Or not legalizing 
[00:41:00]  It's almost like  Arguing about religion  Or politics  It's like  It is in a way  Because people look at it  As a religious thing  Like they look at it the same way  They have like rights and wrongs  And what's black and white  But I think for sure  Adults should be able to do  Whatever the fuck they want to do  Who am I to tell you  You can't do heroin  If you want to do heroin  If you know everything about heroin  You know  You're educated  You know what the facts are  And you want to do it  What the fuck do it  I know some casual coke users  You know  There's not that many  But I know a few  That just  They do it once in a while  They're not addicted to it  And it's like 
[00:41:30]  It works for them  Now there's always going to be things  Where it's like  Well some kid's going to get it  You have to weigh the positives  And the negatives  The amount of crime  That's around because it's illegal  I think outweighs  The bad stuff that's going to happen  When people have more access to it  It's just education  You need education  In the treatment center  But there's no education  At 15 or 16  There is none  Because they  Look at how much education  Why don't they have it  They would be forced to  Parents would be forced  To educate them  They'd be forced to educate  I'm not saying  There isn't any  They get it  They just don't listen  Because they don't think anything  How many 15 
[00:42:00]  I listen  Kids got pregnant  Alright  There's a lot of education  When it comes to sex  Yeah but that's different dude  You got a boner  You're making out  Shit happens  Those kids are being lied to  About pot  And they know that's wrong  And they're like  Well what about this coke  You say that's bad too  I don't know  That is a problem  That's a big part of the problem  But when I was a kid man  I learned quick  I had a buddy of mine  Who was selling  He was selling coke  And him and his girlfriend  Would just do blow all day  He lost like 30 pounds  He looked like a fucking skeleton  You'd hide in his attic all day  Just watch TV and do it below  And I looked at him  And I was like  Fuck cocaine man 
[00:42:30]  That does that  Fuck that  You know people learn  You see people fucking up  And you learn  I mean that's what it's supposed to be  We're supposed to learn  From screw ups in our environment  It's the drug show here  Yeah  Every time I'm on  It turns into drugs  What else we got mom  Do you want more drug guys  Or do you want to try something  Let's try  See if someone's got  A different opinion  Who has questions about rainbows  How about UFC stuff  Do you want to try that show  The teacher had this discussion  With my students  Yeah put that guy on  The guy had this discussion  With his students  Dave from New York 
[00:43:00]  Go ahead  Hey how you guys doing man  What's up dude  I'm a teacher man  And I've had this discussion  In my class even  With regard to  When you were talking earlier  About outlawing it  And the economic effects of it  You know I believe that  The government can even get rid  Of the drug trade here  To a certain degree  Or at least bring a lot of people  To their knees  Is a lot of the big time kingpins  But that they choose not to  Because of the economic  Consequences of that  You know and I've  I mean I've had this discussion 
[00:43:30]  In my classroom  With my kids  And it's been a great debate  With them you know  How old are your kids  Well I teach seniors  Okay  Yeah seniors  They can kind of grasp  The concepts  You know they kind of  They kind of already know  That they're getting fucked too  I mean by the time you're 17  You kind of realize  That your parents  Are just dummies  Who had kids  Is there any really hot seniors  That you know  Are going  Come on  There's got to be  Some fucking hotties  You're going  Oh Jesus  In two years  You want some coke  After school  Come back  In two years

[00:46:00]  And they say  Oh no I don't do that  Nobody says  If you ask them why  They've never done it  They never say  Oh it's cause it's illegal  People don't make choices  About drugs based on legal  That's a good point  That's a real good point  Yeah  I've never done coke  Just cause it seems so fucking harsh  Yeah  Nobody I've ever asked  I mean I've asked hundreds of people  This question  And the same thing holds true  And Joe  To jump on your stuff  A little bit more about this  I mean  If you  If you  Could get some kind of leverage  Around  You know  Trying to get some support  Around the drug thing  All you have to do is say 
[00:46:30]  Look  Let's  Let's legalize everything  And use all the money  That we create  Government wise  To fund education  Yeah but the problem is  To get parents behind it  The problem is  The money would go to the government  It's just like your taxes  Where the fuck  Does it really go  Yeah  I know  You're always going to have that  How much education is there  For alcohol abuse  Yeah like zero  Yeah  All that money that goes to tobacco  How much education is there  To tell kids that tobacco is bad for you  It's like a fucking commercial  Every couple years  You see something  Just say no to smoking  You can possibly do  Yeah  I mean the cigarette numbers 
[00:47:00]  Are really insane  If you think that the government  Is protecting you  Alcohol is an herb  It's a plant  Just like marijuana is  Except it's a plant  That kills  A half a fucking million people  A year in this country alone  Man  I mean that's a crazy number  I've done every single drug  Imagine what  Besides maybe like a heroin  Or crack  And I can tell you by far  Alcohol  I've done more stupid stuff  By drinking a couple of beers  Than anything I've ever done  By doing shrooms  Or acid  Or any of the other things  I've tried in my life  Alcohol by far  Is the worst  Here's what I think 
[00:47:30]  This weekend  If people are getting high  Or drinking  And they come to Governor's  In Levittown  We're on that  It's not going to really bother me  If they come off  What if they're doing coke Rich  If they're doing coke  As long as they buy my DVD  After the show  What if they can't  Shut the fuck up  What if they're doing coke  And they just  Drawn in the audience  I know  Yeah  Cigarettes  Cigarettes are the fucking worst  It's the biggest killer  And it makes your pussy stink  So stop  I quit smoking  Almost six months ago 
[00:48:00]  Girls who smoke cigarettes  They always have like  A weird smell of their pussy  It's always just this weird  Fucking  Funky disease  Like your body's  Fighting it off  In every cell  And your pussy's not spared  From that stink  It's everywhere  It's in your yellow fingernails  And your skin's  A weird grey color  And your pussy smells like death  Have you ever smoked  Have you ever smoked  I smoked once when I was 15  I tried it  I didn't like it  I quit  I got a joke about  Blowjobs are way more addictive  You get one good blowjob  When you're 15  You're fucked for the rest of your life  Yeah  Blowjobs just haunt you 
[00:48:30]  Like a bad memory  Alright  What do we got  Craig from New Jersey  Has got a question for Joe  Go ahead buddy  What's going on  Yo first off  On pretty stuff  That Opie gave you  The reins Joe  Thanks man  You hate Opie  Yo so  What's up with these  Lollipops  Like are they worth it  Where do you get them  Well I get them  In California  In California  They have these  Medical marijuana dispensaries  They call them  Wellness centers  It's hilarious  You walk  You walk into  A fucking store  I mean it's  Basically a store  You show them 
[00:49:00]  Your prescription  And you buy weed  You know  And the place that I go to  You buy it with  A fucking credit card  I pay for it  With American Express  Buy just bags of weed  I buy pot soda  Pot lollipops  Yeah but you gotta have  You gotta have a prescription  But how do you get a prescription  You go to the doctor  The doctor says  What's wrong  You say I get headaches  When do you get headaches  Whenever I think about  The fact that pot's illegal  Bang  You got a prescription  Really  Yeah it's that fucking easy  They're trying to give away  Prescriptions  My doctor's hilarious  He's this cool  Old black dude  He was a fucking 
[00:49:30]  He was an emergency room  Surgeon  For 25 years  So he just saw  Fucking gunshot wounds  People getting run over  By cars and shit  And now he just  Dispenses weed  And when you walk  Into his office  The first thing he says  You look sick  You look sick my man  You need some medicine  You need some healing  How about you my friend  You look sick too  Sit down  I'm gonna be right with you  And he just like  Looks at you  Man isn't weed  A wonderful thing  Isn't it wonderful  I'm like dude  It's the best man  Would it be a better world  If anybody smoked weed  It would be a better world 
[00:50:00]  And he's just writing  My prescription  While he's saying that  He really thinks  It's not harmful at all  And it's like  Why shouldn't people have it  If it'll help them out  You know all it is  It makes people nicer  It makes people more relaxed  And all the prejudice  That we have on it  Is all based on propaganda  Yeah there's some  Fucking dumb stoners  Out there  But there's some dumb  Everything out there  There's all kinds of dumb people  And if you get a fucking  Retard high  They're still gonna be retarded  What's up dude  How long do you think  Before Jersey's like California  I don't know man  People gotta fight for it 
[00:50:30]  You know the thing about California  Is it's the most progressive state  In the country  So people have been fighting for it  For a long time  And in 1996  Is when they passed  Proposition 215  And made it legal  So they gotta fight for it  There's 11 states right now  That have medical marijuana  And it's growing  But you know what man  It's not an easy battle  Because it's a battle of education  People even in California  There's a city near my house  In Agora  Where they don't want it  So they booted it out  And they passed a law  You can't have a medical marijuana  Dispensary in Agora  You know it's real weird 
[00:51:00]  Because it's state legal  But it's not federally legal  So if anybody  Like people complain  Then the federal government  The DEA can come down on them  It's all fucked up man  When you say about marijuana  I don't know  Whatever in jail  Now these aren't just marijuana  That's been busted  Like an ounce or less  That are  No a lot of it's dealers  You know  But I mean people  Who get busted  In certain states  You get busted with a joint  You go to fucking jail  Yeah  You go to jail for like  Six months in certain states  No  Yes man 
[00:51:30]  There's some zero tolerance states  Certain places  It's way harsher than other places  Yeah  There's a lot of states  That are living in the fucking 30s  They don't know what's going on  Think about this too  In terms of like  When it's going to be in New Jersey  Like legal or  Yeah  California was the first one  To outlaw smoking inside  Yeah  And then how long  Did that take for New York  To catch on  A few years  But it's more  It's more controversial than that  Because of children  You know  Here's the bottom line man  There's a big chunk of this country  That's living in the fucking dark ages  And if you don't think that's true  Take a drive  Get your car in New Jersey  And drive across the country  And stop every two hours  And look around 
[00:52:00]  Yeah  You'll be fucking shocked  Oh shit  You can find it  Go to Newark  In parts of Jersey  You can find it in  But most of the country  Is a red state  And the reason why  They're red states  Isn't because  They're educated  Because they've thought this out  They're a red state  Because those people  Are saying the right shit for them  Family  God  This  That  And they're simple minded people  Who want everything  In a little simple minded box  And they hear drugs  And they just go  Oh  Bad  Yeah  Bad drug  Is gonna fucking ruin this country 
[00:52:30]  And that's all they hear  And that's all they think  And it's gonna take a long time  The internet is helping it  The internet and education  And you know  And more people standing up  And telling the truth about it  That's why Jews got such a bad rap  In the Midwest  And out of the South  Because all the propaganda  Yeah  When the farms were being foreclosed  Back in the 80s  When you know  Farm  They were just  The government was  Farm aid time  Yeah  Was closing farms  Because they were  You know  The head of  Supremist organizations  And stuff  To recruit people  The Jews  The Jew bankers  Are closing your farms 
[00:53:00]  And Jews didn't even run the banks  Jews never  You know  Chase Manhattan  Jews  These weren't Jew-run banks  But these people  Didn't have any knowledge  And they needed somebody  I mean  It can't be yourself  It's gonna be  The one with the horn  Well you always gotta  Point your finger  It's too hard  To look deep into things  So the first thing they hear  Is the thing that's gonna stick  For most people  The first thing they hear  Is the thing they're gonna remember  You know  It's real hard  To look in  And do a Google search  And start reading articles  On the internet  And pick up a book  And find out the history of it  Yeah  People don't do that 
[00:53:30]  They hear one thing  Jew banker  What those motherfuckers  And it's great to have an excuse too  That's why I always got laid  I always  The first thing I said to the girl  Is I'll never hurt you  And you know  That sticks  The first thing  I'll always be there for you  What do you gotta do  Alright  Let's get a girl in here  Wendy from Maryland  Go ahead  Hi  What's up Wendy  Hi Joe  I just wanted to let you know  First of all  I love you  Oh thank you  I love you too  I love watching you on UFC  I love it  But I have a question 
[00:54:00]  First of all  I think you should run for president  I love your views  Why do you want me to get shot  No  No no no  You wouldn't definitely get shot  I would be president  For about 13 minutes  Unless you had a Jew vice president  You'll never get shot  They've got that whole president thing  Wrapped up  There's no presidents anymore  The last time we had a president  He took a slow ride  In a convertible through Dallas  Yeah  There's no presidents now  They're spokesmen  For giant corporations  That's all it is  True  I mean I think  I think we need a big meteor  To clean everything up  My other question is 
[00:54:30]  You have those suckers  Are they chronic candy suckers  No no no  The chronic candy  Just tastes like pot  This is made with pot  Okay  Because that's what I was going to say  I had those chronic candy ones  And they suck  I do not like them at all  No those are disgusting  Joe gave me my first pot  Pop  Or whatever it's called  And I called them  El Diablo for the next month  Because it seemed fine  It was like  I'm just looking  Nothing's happening  You're like easy on that  I was like whatever  Fuck you easy  I don't feel anything 
[00:55:00]  And then I just started seeing  My god and my devil  Fighting out for control of my soul  People always want to claim machismo  When it comes to pot  Like dude I'm fine  Like I told you  I fucked Charlie Murphy up dude  I fucked that guy up  He wouldn't get high before  He went on stage for the rest of the tour  But also it tastes like butterscotch  Yeah  It's never bad for you  Butterscotch  You've had those sodas too right  I give you a pot  That was a good  Fucking all body buzz  It was really good  It tastes like crap though  I got some stuff that'll rock you dude  I got some little Listerine strips  Those little things you put on your tongue 
[00:55:30]  Yeah  Like little breast strips  They're little strips  Yeah  You put it in your tongue  And all of a sudden  You're on fucking Pluto  It's called blot or acid  No it's called pot  It's called pot Listerine strips man  Where do you live in Maryland?  Cumberland  It's a small hick town  Yeah  Do they have any  Is there a lot of pot there and stuff?  Yeah  That's all there is to do here  The problem is you never know what you're getting  You know that's the thing about the medical marijuana thing in California  Is you know exactly what you're getting  You know what strain it is  You know like where it's coming from  You know the percentage of THC 
[00:56:00]  You know  It's like they've got it down to a science in California  Cops don't really care too  They don't give a fuck  How bad is it in New York?  I don't think they care  No  I hosted the High Times Music Awards here  We did it at BB King's  And there was fucking weed passed around left and right here  Really?  And cops are outside  I don't know how they did it  I don't know who they greased up  Or what  But the thing about California is  It's so overwhelming  In San Francisco  There's twice as many medical marijuana dispensaries  As there are Burger Kings  There's 40  There's 20  McDonald's 
[00:56:30]  20 McDonald's  40 medical marijuana dispensaries  Really?  Yeah  They're not stopping  They're not stopping  They're not stopping  You know  Alright thanks Wendy  Thank you  Is anybody for the  Making drugs illegal?  Do you have any callers that way?  Oh yeah you'll get called  Not on this show  No  Not yet  Fucking open Anthony dude  What are you kidding me?  You're the other side  Half these people haven't left their basements  What are you kidding me?  They want to make treadmills illegal  If you're going to make drugs illegal  You got to make the dangerous ones illegal first 
[00:57:00]  And no one's doing that  Alcohol and tobacco  Those are number one and number two  Those are the fucking scary ones man  Those are the ones that are killing people  There's too much money behind that  You're not going to  You guys want to take a quick break  And there's a bunch of UFC questions  You want to break and then go to those?  Are those for Voss?  I don't need a break  You need a break?  Do you guys have to take a break?  No  Then let's just keep going  Alright cool  Yeah  Alright switching gears  Let's go to Sean in New Orleans  Sean go ahead man  Hey Joe  What's up dude?  A couple UFCs ago  They had a dude with a caved in chest 
[00:57:30]  Oh yeah that's Chay Tellingman  And you didn't say anything  I was like dude you're a comedian  Oh no I've talked about it before  He's fought a bunch of times in the UFC  He's a real good fighter  He actually got in a car accident when he was a baby  And uh  Yeah and he got really fucked up  And you know one of his pectoral muscles is missing  And his chest is caved in  He has no pectoral muscle?  Yeah yeah  And he can kill people?  It's real weird  Yeah oh yeah he'll fuck you up  Does he just not punch on that side?  No he punches both hands  He's a professional boxer  So where does his power come from? 
[00:58:00]  The punching is not actually from your chest  Your chest is really to push things away from you  Punching is really from your back and your shoulders  Okay  That's the real muscles  Just how does he get  Like if you look at like Roy Jones Jr  He's a real good puncher  He never had a big chest  He doesn't have big triceps  It's all shoulders and biceps  If people get on top of him  Can he not throw them off?  He can throw them off  I mean he can bench press  He's just you know  On that side  He's using more of his shoulder  And other muscles and triceps  When you watch like the ultimate fighting  And the 
[00:58:30]  Like if you watch a karate tournament  There's like  So much more kicking  And the kicking looks more  Deadly  You know what I mean?  In ultimate fighting  The kicking isn't as deadly  As it is  You know  Sure it is  Guys it's knocked out  Let me tell you something  You get hit in the head  It's a little more difficult to land a kick  Because it's a little slower  And you know  It's a little more obvious  You see it coming  You use your whole body when you do it  But if a guy lands a fucking kick to your head dude  You're going to sleep  You know  A lot of guys can take a good punch  There's very few guys who can take a kick to the head 
[00:59:00]  Well a side kick or  Like you're talking  You know  A roundhouse to the head  You're talking right?  Any kind of kick to the head man  Most of the kicks that land to the head  The knee to the head  Yeah  Flying knee  Yeah  Most of the kicks that land  I mean if you land a foot  And the guy's like moving away  You can get away with it  But if you get caught in the head  With a fucking shin  Like you get shinned to the head  Dude that's like getting hit in the head  With a baseball bat  I mean the only thing that saves guys  Is that the guy's kicking you  He's really tired  You know  And he's exhausted  And he's not getting full energy into it 
[00:59:30]  Or you know  You're moving away from the blow  But it's way more powerful to kick somebody  Just think about  Yeah  It's four times as strong  Yeah the legs  And you're using your whole torso  But it's just that  I mean years ago  When I used to watch karate tournaments  Or you would see like  You know a taekwondo tournament  Whether it's pussy or this or that  And you'd see like a reverse roundhouse  And it was just so  You know clean like that  You know what I mean  Just  You know  And the guys are sparring  And you see  Just back and forth  And it almost looks like  Like it's orchestrated  You know what I mean 
[01:00:00]  And then with ultimate fight  You'll never see like a reverse roundhouse  Yeah you do  You do  Like a wheel kick or something  You do  But the guys have to be really good at it  See the thing about mixed martial arts is  Everybody's coming from a different discipline  A lot of guys are coming from wrestling  A lot of guys are coming from kickboxing  And there's very few guys  That are coming from taekwondo  But the guys who are coming from taekwondo  If they know how to use that shit  There's a few kicks  My background originally was in taekwondo  Most of taekwondo is useless  But there's a few kicks that work  Like David Loazzo's got a nasty spinning back kick 
[01:00:30]  And he stopped Charles McCarthy with it in the UFC  And it's a fucking badass move  And very few guys throw it  But if a guy's good at it  And he throws it and it lands  It'll fucking cripple you man  It's like getting hit with a  With a  Like a telephone pole  In the middle of your chest  And then there's wheel kicks  Or a spinning heel kick  If nobody's doing those yet  But those will knock you the fuck out man  If someone's good at it  And they figure out how to do it  It's going to enter into the UFC  It's just going to take some time  The sport is evolving right now  Right now what we're seeing is  You know  Step three or four 
[01:01:00]  In a multi-step process  Of this sport becoming  You know like  It's really  It's the sport of fighting  You know  And fighting  There's a whole bunch of different ways to fight  And initially they thought  When the UFC was first around  Well it's only about grappling man  If Hoist Gracie gets a hold of you  He takes you to the ground  Well guys figured out  How to not get taken down to the ground  They figured out how to keep away  And knock you the fuck out standing  Like a guy like Chuck Liddell  So all of a sudden  That became the way to fight  But there's going to be people  That figure that style out too 
[01:01:30]  There's going to be better kickboxers  There's going to be guys  Who figure out how to pull guard  There's going to  It's a constant evolution  You know  It's a young sport  I mean it's only been around  In this country  Really as ultimate fighting  Since 1993  I was  I don't know if I was  What I was watching  But don't  Isn't there guys that just come in  That don't have a martial art background  That are just  Ballroom brawlers  Those guys are fucked  That was in the old days  That's it  I mean Tank Abbott  I mean everybody calls about Tank Abbott  Tank Abbott  He's a serious wrestler  He knows how to wrestle  You know he's an athlete  He knows how to box 
[01:02:00]  I mean he's not an untrained fighter  He puts on this thing  Like he fights in bars  And he will fight in bars  And he does like getting drunk  And he does like doing that  But the bottom line is  That guy knows how to fight  The reason why he fought  In all those UFC's  And did so well  Is because he knows how to fight  You can't just take a guy  With no training  Who thinks he's a badass  And fight  Because it's like saying  You don't know how to speak a language  And someone teaches you a few words  And you go run  And try to have a conversation  With someone  Not even have a conversation  But have an argument with someone  I mean that's what it's like  These guys are so fucking good now 
[01:02:30]  There's so many guys  That are so good  In so many areas  In so many  In wrestling  In boxing  In kickboxing  They'll just fuck you up  You got no chance  That's like when Tyson  Went to prison  You know there was  Someone that wanted to test him  Because he might have been  The tough prison guy  But Tyson was a fucking fighter  Yeah  And just probably  Knocked every fucker  That came out  I bet they just  Left him the fuck alone man  I mean who wants  To get punked by Tyson  Yeah  Fuck that man  Alright  Tim from Florida  Go ahead  Hey Joe 
[01:03:00]  Quick question for you man  I'm looking to get into it  And with all the studios  That are popping up here  And there  Especially in Florida  Is there a website  That you can help out  A guy starting out  Yes  The best website  You can go to  The best website  You can go to  For mixed martial arts  Is MMA.tv  There's a forum  Called The Underground  The Underground Forum  It's the best  Mixed martial arts website  In the world  Bar none  Without a doubt  Any questions you have  About legitimate gyms  Or trainers  Or anything  Pro fighters  Post on that  I post on that thing 
[01:03:30]  Every day  I check it every day  Everyone that I know  That's involved in the UFC  Dana White  Anyone that I know  That's involved in  Any of the different organizations  Whether it's the IFL  Or Pride  They all check the Underground  The Underground is the shit  If you got any questions  Go there  What part of Florida  Are you at?  Thanks man  What part of Florida?  Where am I in Florida?  I'm in Port St. Lucie  What's that near?  Is that near Miami?  West Palm Beach  Sebastian  How far is West Palm 
[01:04:00]  West Palm Beach  Is not that far from Miami right?  That's not  No no no  You gotta go  An hour  An hour  American Top Team  If you want to get involved  In the UFC  American Top Team  Is in Florida  And it's literally  One of the best gyms  In the country  There's maybe  Three or four  Of the best gyms  In the country  American Top Team  Is one of them  And it's run by  This guy named  Dan Lambert  Who's this rich character  Who loves fighting  Put it together  And it's down there  I think they're in Miami  But I think you can go to  Just do a Google search on it 
[01:04:30]  And find them  But American Top Team  Is you couldn't get  A better place to train  Some of the best trainers  In the world there  What do you think  Alright thanks man  Real quick  Liddell Ortiz  Who's better?  Liddell  He beat him before  And you know  Tito Ortiz is a good fighter  But if you look at  Their skill set  I mean look  Anything can happen  Tito might win the fight  I mean you can never  You can never guess  I mean fights are crazy  That's why they fight  In the first place  But if you look at  Their two skill sets  Liddell's a better wrestler  His takedown defense  Is insane  And he's got sick  Knockout power  And he put Tito to sleep already 
[01:05:00]  So he's confident  The only thing  That's going to fuck him up  Is if he goes into this fight  And he doesn't train hard  And believe me  The last person  He wants to lose to  Is Tito  So he's going to train hard  But who knows man  Anything can happen  And plus Tito Ortiz  Has got Jenna Jameson power  For like the average person  That's not going to  That's real  For the guy that's not going to compete  What's the best thing for him  Like for somebody  Well if you're not going to compete  You know it depends on  What you're doing it for  If you're doing it for exercise  I mean some people like  Some people like jiu jitsu  Some people like striking  They like boxing 
[01:05:30]  Or Muay Thai  You know it's all  It's all in you know  What you enjoy  I like the jiu jitsu  Because there's no real injuries  Well you get it  I've had two major knee surgeries  I've had two reconstructed ACLs  One well one of them  Is from Taekwondo  But two of them  I've had three knee surgeries  Two of them from jiu jitsu  Really?  A meniscus tear  And an ACL tear  I mean you can get hurt  I'm sure  I've known a lot of guys  I've known guys  Break their arm  Break their leg  Break their ribs  Shit happens  But you don't get head injuries  Like you do sparring  When I used to kick box man 
[01:06:00]  I'd go home  And I'd have fucking headaches  You'd lie in bed  And it sucks man  You know  Just sparring  Just sparring  You take shots  And it's not even  Your sparring partner's fault  Sometimes  You walk into something  You know  He's trying to pull a punch  But you walk into a knee  Or something man  And then your fucking head hurts  And the reason why your head hurts  Is because you got brain damage bitch  And that shit's real  You know  And I prefer not to get brain damage  So I try to limit my striking  And I just do a lot of jiu jitsu  How about Krav Maga?  That's for fags  Thank you  All right  I found somebody with a 
[01:06:30]  Dissenting opinion on the drug issue  Josh from Oregon  Go ahead man  What's up Joe?  Good to meet you  What's up Josh?  Hey  I have just a little different take  On the drug situation  Don't get me wrong  I love drugs  Fucking awesome  And from everything  Except you know  The heroin  And the meth  All that shit  Fuck that  But if we open it up to everything  The stipulation is just  Drugs are kind of legal  Or they're all illegal  It's completely fucked up  Because the whole  Massive as a whole 
[01:07:00]  Would just  Take themselves  Under  You know  Just take themselves down  And  That's the only problem  With opening them up  To be legal  Is that everybody  Would just  Not have that  That stipulation  Like oh I don't want to get caught  So we'll do it safely  Well I think you're a great example  How education is important  In this country  Well he's your drug user  That's your lobby right  Yeah  You know what I think man  I think I don't want a fucking daddy  I'm a grown man  I'm a grown man  And I don't want the government  To be my fucking daddy  I think the government  Should be really 
[01:07:30]  Really  Really  Really  Really  Really  Really small  Here's  Wait hold on  Hold on a second  First of all  No one under 25  Should have a conversation  Because they're not smart  Maybe legal  At a certain age  Maybe legal  At 28  There we go  Not 21  Maybe like  You know  When you're  28 and above  21  26  As soon as you're legal  As soon as it's  It's okay for you to fight  If you can go to war  And fight for your country  You should be able to get high  And think about  Why you're going to war  To fight somebody  You never fucking met 
[01:08:00]  You know  I mean  You want to do some mushrooms  And think about the fact  That we're fighting  We're having tribal war  And our tribe  Is sending us  To another part of the world  I mean  That's a real problem  With drugs  Is that drugs  Would change all that shit  And that's what happened  In the 60s  One of the reasons  Why drugs  Why they're so hard on drugs  Is because  The culture of this  Entire country  Changed in the 60s  And it changed largely  Because of  The consumption of psychedelics  Because of drugs  Because of acid  Because of LSD  And because of  Marijuana  I mean  That's what changed  Everything 
[01:08:30]  And I think  That's the reason why  What was that guy's point?  The dissenting opinions  They're retards  That guy was building  Something in the background  Yeah but you're just saying  I don't even know  What he's wrong  But you just said  Their opinions are retards  But he was  He's high  He's a user  So what side is  Is he a retard  On the against side  Or is he a retard  Because he's a user  He was a retard  Well he wasn't a retard  He was  This is what he was  He was mentally retarded  You say so  Technically  This is what I say  I think he's probably  A little buzzed  When he called us  And probably not used  To talking on the radio 
[01:09:00]  And didn't come off  As smooth as he wanted to  But the bottom line is  He's wanting to be protected  You know  That's what the guy's saying  You open up the door  And everybody's gonna do it  I don't want a daddy man  Okay  And there's gonna be  Dummies out there  And there's gonna be  People doing stupid shit  But you know what  You can't protect people  From themselves  And I'm  Look I'm a liberal  In some areas  But I'm a social Darwinist man  And I think that  You know  The only way evolution  Is ever gonna really play out  Is if the weak  Fucking die off  And that's reality  This is the thing  With any laws too 
[01:09:30]  They raise the speed limit  From 60 to 65  And they say  Well this will increase  Deaths by this much percentage  Right  They say you know what  It's worth it  Well you know what  Dude they used to say  That about women voting  You know  And before they made  I mean women have only  Been voting for less  Than a hundred fucking years  And what they were saying  Before they allowed  Women to vote was  They used to say  It would kill society  It would destroy society  You cannot let women vote  And when women  Started voting  What the fuck changed  Nothing changed  Nothing  Yeah go to a network meeting  No  That's not  Women voting 
[01:10:00]  It just leads  From one thing  To another  It does  You know  Comedy Central  Won't let you  Use the word bitch  Huh  You can't say bitch  Is that real  You can say fucking shit  And they'll beep it  Bitch you can't even use  First of all  I have a  Whoa  Really  Yeah  They said no gay bashing  No use the word bitch  And no rape or AIDS  Dude when we did the man show  And by the way  I know the man show sucked  And it was only partially our fault  Part of it was my fault  Because I was trying to do  Two shows at the same time  Fear Factor and the man show  At the same time  And that was  It was impossible  And there was way too many battles 
[01:10:30]  To fight over there  But part of it  It was the fucking restrictions  They put on us  Were ridiculous  It made no sense  And it was in the  Janet Jackson nipple era  Where everybody was going crazy  But we had a game show  That Doug and I tried to do  Called Make Me Hard  Where we did stuff  And the guy would have a box  On his dick  And a light would go off  When he got a hard on  We couldn't call it  Make Me Hard  But we could call it  Make Me Stiff  That was like a serious argument  That we had  Where they sit down  We think hard is too much  It's too much  We want to make stiff  We can say stiff  What the fuck are you talking about 
[01:11:00]  You're exchanging one word  With another word  That means exactly the same thing  With no confusion whatsoever  It makes no sense  But they're all just trying  To protect their job  They're all retarded  Well I have a pilot with them now  So I don't think anything  They do is wrong  What's your pilot Rich?  It's called The Best Man  It's fucking hilarious  What's it about?  Wedding  Like we'll go up  I'll be the host  And there's a new co-host  Every week  And the couples get married  And we go interview them  Hang out with the family  He'll be with the wives  With the ladies  And I'll be with them 
[01:11:30]  Bachelor parties  Softball  Whatever  And we're just spending time  With them the whole  And then during the wedding  We go up and roast the couple  Really?  We just find out a lot about them  And then  Yeah we find out  Regular people can't take that  Most people can't take that  Well then they don't sign on  It was  The pilot was so much  I did it with Patrice  Is that the one  Is that the one I heard about  Where the  Executive wanted to come down  And watch  Patrice lit into them  How does everybody hear about 
[01:12:00]  Everything in this fucking business?  Florentine  Oh what?  Florentine  Can anything  It was so funny  And it just  You know  It's so uncomfortable  That you know  You go into  And if it  You know  That sounds like a good show  Yeah that could be really fun  Is it  Has it been picked up?  We're not finished  I gotta go do  Finish it up  Do some voiceovers  And stuff  Sweet  So it's gonna be called  The best man  Yeah  Look for it  Fuckers  What else we got?  Alright  Bo  Bo in Tennessee  Go ahead man  Hey what's up Joe 
[01:12:30]  What's up dude  Hey  Missed you on the last couple UFC's  Man it just doesn't flow  As well without you  But my question is  You know  UFC is just dominating  As far as  Where boxing used to be  As far as  Popularity in a sport  Do you see like  Another brand coming up  To compete with UFC  Because you look at  Like De La Hoya's fight  Coming up  He's getting paid like  40 million dollars  For this thing  And the UFC guys  I mean  Some of them  Even have to work  Other jobs  And can't train  All the time  Do you see another brand 
[01:13:00]  Coming up to compete  With them  Well there's a most  First of all  Most boxers  Work other jobs  I mean  De La Hoya  Is not most boxers  Tito Ortiz  And Chuck Liddell  Those guys don't work  Other jobs  And they make millions  But is someone  Going to come up  To compete with the UFC  For sure  I mean  There's a bunch  Of different organizations  Right now  That are coming up  Pride is starting  To make their way  Into the United States  They're huge in Japan  At one point in time  They used to sell  90,000 seat theaters out  Or arenas out  I mean  They're monstrous in Japan  They've kind of  Dropped off a little bit  Because they have  Evolvement with some 
[01:13:30]  Organized crime  Stuff in Japan  It's a little funky  Over there  But there's also  The IFL  Which is another  Big organization  That's coming up  And they have  Some  Fight shows  On Fox Sports Net  And they have  A whole team concept  They have like  You know  Like the  California Anacondas  And all these  Different teams  And like  Five man teams  And they fight  Against each other  And shit  And there's  A bunch of other ones  There's a WFA  And it's growing  All across the country  It's growing  And there's all  Sorts of new  Organizations  That are constantly  Coming up  But the UFC 
[01:14:00]  Has a giant jump  On them  The UFC  They do it the best  They have the most  Money to throw at them  The guys who own  The UFC  Are super rich dudes  Who spent  An incredible amount  Of money  What most people  Don't realize  About the UFC  Before the UFC  Became popular  Those dudes  Were 44 million dollars  In the hole  They had spent  44 million dollars  With no return  So they were  Constantly losing money  Before it actually  Caught on  With the TV show  The Ultimate Fighter  And then eventually  The pay per view numbers  Went through the  Fucking roof  And now it's huge  But they were 
[01:14:30]  Deep deep deep  In the hole  And 44 million dollars  Means you have to  Make 88 million dollars  Because that kind of money  You're in a 48% tax bracket  So you have to make  Twice that  To have that for profit  So these guys were  Deep in the fucking hole  And most people  Can't afford to get  That deep in  So they bail out  There's a company  Called the WFA  They're a huge organization  They have all these  Big money guys  Behind them  Big plans  They put on one show  In LA  It tanked  They lost a shit load  Of money  And everybody 
[01:15:00]  Backed the fuck out  And they were supposed  To have a show  Next weekend in Vegas  And the show's cancelled  And now they've moved it  To sometime in January  I hope for all of them  Dude  I hope they all make it  I want these fighters  To be making shit loads  Of money  It's a fucking tough  Way to make a living  And that's all  I'm concerned with  I want to make sure  These guys can retire  Comfortably  And they don't have to fight  Like way past the time  That they want to  Because they need the money  Yeah I got one more question  Do you see another  Weight class coming in  Between the 155 and 170  Yes  You know what  I'm doing a new show 
[01:15:30]  It actually starts  It airs tonight  I think  Is today Thursday  Yeah  It airs tonight  At midnight  On Spike  It's called  Inside the UFC  And I'm hosting it  And we sit down  With Dana White  And it's one of the things  We talk about  Is weight classes  There's going to be  A 145 pound weight class  Eventually  And they're going to  Make the weight classes  Smaller  Instead of a big jump  Between like 170  And 185  They're going to figure out  What to do  And they're weighing it out  But the real thing is  It has to go past  The Nevada State  Athletic Commission  And all the other  State athletic commissions  As well  It's not as simple as 
[01:16:00]  Let's just decide  To make guys  Who weigh 110 fight  I mean you have to get  That weight class  Approved by the  Athletic commissions  So it's kind of tricky  Yeah Uriah Faber's  Coming over there right  What's that?  Uriah Faber  Yeah Uriah Faber  Yeah he was  He was hanging out  At the last UFC  And hopefully  He'll be fighting over there  Yeah there's a perfect example  Of a guy who's a great fighter  But he's not quite big enough  To fight 155  But he's fucking awesome  At 145  And you know  There's a bunch of guys  Jeff Curran  Ivan Menjivar  There's a bunch of great guys  Who fight at 145 
[01:16:30]  And I would like to see  That weight class open up  I'm good friends  With Rich Clemente  And it just  You know  155 didn't suit him  And 170's  Kind of too big for him  So it's  It's an in between  For him  So  Yeah that's  That's another good example  That guy should be fighting  Like 160 something  You know  Yeah exactly  So I appreciate it Joe  Thanks a lot  Alright dude  Take it easy man  I met these guys  I wonder if they do this  Around the country  I guess they do  They were called  The Fight Club  And they get together  Every like Saturday or Sunday  And beat the fuck out of each other  Yeah  I mean but they're really 
[01:17:00]  I mean they're doing the  They're doing everything  They got weapons  They're doing  What?  Weapons?  Yeah  Weapons  They're teaching  They're teaching and fighting  Teaching each other and fighting  You know  There's one day  Do they fight with the weapons?  I didn't see that part  But they were there  The weapons were there  You know  There's sticks  And whatever  Whatever  But these dudes were killers  I'm telling you  They were  You know  There was one  He was so big  And he showed me  You know  Go just show me something  He took it like that  I mean I'm small anyhow 
[01:17:30]  But  They just practiced  And this was  Some of them were just so  The average looking guy  Maybe one was a little overweight  They're the kind of guy that  If they cut in front of you in line  You'd say something to them  And it could kill you  In the blink of an eye  Or if they cut you off in the car  You know  You don't even know  Right  What half of these killers look like  And these guys were killers  Well there's a lot of guys  Who fight in the UFC  That don't look that scary  You know  And they're  I mean you look at them  They look like average sized guys  Boss  Doesn't look 
[01:18:00]  Boss  Did you say boss  Yeah  Boss Rootin  Yeah  Boss Rootin looks like a fucking killer  Are you crazy  Really  Inclosed  When you saw Boss Rootin  You'd talk shit to him  The guy's a fucking animal  I don't talk to anybody  But enclosed  His neck is as big as your fucking waist  He's got a shaved head  He's covered with tattoos  Tattoos on the palms of his fucking hands  And you look in his eyes  You see straight psycho  Bye Rootin  Is that a better example  He's talking about  He's talking about  Former UFC heavyweight champion  This guy Boss Rootin  Former king of Pancrase  Probably one of the most brutal strikers  Ever to fight in MMA  Just shut the fuck up 
[01:18:30]  If you have a tattoo  I didn't think he'd look that big  If you have a tattoo above your neck  Don't fuck with that guy  Anybody can get a tattoo above your neck  Yeah but you see  They don't care  They have nothing to lose  Well when you get choked out  And you have a tattoo above your neck  You look even stupider  That's funny  You get tattoos on your face  Like the game  When you like to choke out the game  I like to get that dude's back  You're a little L.A. on your finch  You want to fuck  Go to sleep  Look all you have to do  To get a tattoo in your face 
[01:19:00]  Is go to a tattoo artist  And be dumb enough  To get a tattoo in your face  It's not  Most of the people  That don't think about the future  Yeah that's the problem  Those guys aren't accountants  Were you there  When we ran into those fucking guys  In San Diego with Bobby Lee  You weren't there  It was me and Jimmy Schubert  And Bobby Lee  This fucking guy  Had these tattooed tears in his face  And Jimmy Schubert  Was trying to pick up his girl  And we almost got killed  Pick up his girl  Yeah  We almost got killed  God that guy's a dick for pussy  Guys got tattoos on his fucking face  Teardrops  Yeah what more does he have to lose  He's not a clown 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  Either that guy's a killer  Or he's really sad  Either way  Leave his girlfriend alone  He's not a clown  He looked like a fucking straight killer  It looked like he just got out  20 minutes ago  Most tattoo guys  When they have him on their face  They are pretty tough  Or at least reckless  Yeah  Yeah  At least reckless  So that whole thing  You know  Unless they have like  Lips  Like they tattooed a kiss  Well if you see a guy  With a tattoo of the  Leprechaun  The fighting Notre Dame  You don't worry about him 
[01:20:00]  Yeah  Alright  Or the Tasmanian devil  Alright hack  That's a hack tattoo  But when you see a guy  With spider webs on his elbow  Okay  Or a tear  Yeah that's why  It doesn't look cool  Or the SS signal  The SS on his hand  Maybe you should back off  Have you ever watched  Felony fights?  You ever watch some of that shit  On the internet?  Like in jail?  No no  They take these guys  Who just got out of jail  And they have them fight  And there's fucking no rules  They fight in like a fucking orchard  Like in  Really?  Yeah it was ridiculous  They fought in like some dirt  Dirt field  And this one guy  No rules 
[01:20:30]  Got out of jail  Covered in tattoos  And this fucking Mexican guy  Beat the fuck out of him  Really?  One guy didn't know how to fight  And one guy did  And there's no rules  And they don't stop the fight  So the guy was out cold  And this Mexican guy  Is dropping knees on him  While he's out cold  Like throwing his whole body weight down  Bang  Over and over again  Bang  And the guy's making  The most disturbing noise  The guy who was unconscious  Is going  Like his body is just fucking  Because when you get knocked out 
[01:21:00]  It's basically like  Your brain is just short circuited  And sent an electrical charge  Through your system  So all of his system  Is firing all fucked up  All at once  And he's making all these  Crazy noises  And he's stiff  Because it's not regulated  Is that the fight?  Oh that's it  That's a trailer  From Felony Fight  Oh that's a trailer  From Felony Fight  Three people going at once  Oh there's  Well some of them  I mean  But the one that I saw  I've seen a couple of them  But the one that I saw  This is one white guy  And this Mexican guy  And the Mexican guy  He knew how to fight  And the Mexican guy 
[01:21:30]  Beat the fuck out of this white guy  Is that Tracy Morgan?  Yeah  Felony Fight  It's crazy  Someone's going to die in that  I've got to start going to these sites  I don't know these sites  I've got to start fighting  Look at that  That's all night  How can you not know that  These sites  Real real real fights  Yeah  These guys beat the fuck out of each other  Bare knuckles  What do they get?  Money?  I guess they probably pay him  You know what I mean  They must give him something  Yeah  Oh my  Look at that  Yeah  Dude  You don't even know  Because they don't stop the fights 
[01:22:00]  The guys are unconscious  And they get smashed  Well they don't have to pay for reps  They pulled this guy off eventually  But he had already dropped  Like three or four knees  I mean talking about  His whole body weight  Like leaping up in the air  And then dropping a knee  On this guy's fucking face  This is in the street  Yeah  Oh they fight everywhere dude  They do it in parking lots  The one that I saw  Was like in an apple orchard  Oh these guys are in between trees  Beating the fuck out of each other  Look at this  Yeah it's pretty crazy man  Tattoos on his knees  Oh look at these guys  Look at her 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  Well this is hard to listen to  What else we got  I know  Look at  Hey look at  Look at  Look at  People driving their car  Look at what  Fuck face  I thought they were all on the internet  XM sucks  This is bullshit  I got the bad version  Oh this is exciting radio  We got anybody else calling  Here we're gonna do some magic tricks now  Dave from Tennessee  What's your question  Hey what's going on Joe  What's up dude  Hey what  Listen  I mean I love the UFC  I do  But I think it's just gone too commercial  I mean back in the day 
[01:23:00]  When it first started  They would fight three or four times a night  I mean that was fighting  You know men of men's there  Now I mean  And but  You kind of summed it up  A few minutes ago  You said that they were in the hole  Now I kind of understand  Why they had to  You know change a few things  And make it more commercial  But I mean  I just really enjoyed it  When they  You know  They would get in there  Fighting like I said  Three or four times a night  Sometimes  And move their way up  It's kind of interesting  But as an athlete  As a fighter  It's the worst way to do it  Because those guys  If they're fighting three or four times a night  Man  Like we've seen it  In Japan 
[01:23:30]  Japan still has tournaments pride  They'll still have  Like they have their  The middleweight grand prix  And the heavyweight grand prix  Where they make guys fight twice in a night  And you get fucked up dude  And you got like an hour to recover  And guess what  If you break a foot  Or you break your shin  Or your hand  You're not gonna be able to fight  Good in the next fight  You're not gonna be able to fight as well  So you're getting guys  They get hurt real bad  Then they have to fight again  So they don't get to put on the best performance  And it's not fair  Because one guy can win a fight  In ten seconds  With one punch 
[01:24:00]  And the next guy can fight  A grueling decision fight  And be completely battered  And have those two fight in the finals  And it could have been a great fight  But it's not gonna be now  Because one guy's all fucked up and injured  And the other guy's fresh  Yeah  I mean that kind of makes it  A little more interesting  You know  And it kind of weeds  I feel it  It weeds out the  You know  The weaker ones  But I mean  If you've ever fought before  You would understand  I've fought in taekwondo tournaments  Where you had to fight  Many times in a day  And taekwondo is nothing  Compared to the UFC  But you get hurt man  And then you have to fight  Like an hour later 
[01:24:30]  And you're all fucked up  It's just  You can't compete  At your best  And fighting  Is so fucking dangerous  As it is  And these guys are spending  You know  Six to eight weeks  In these training camps  And they're fucking  They're doing plyometrics  And they're watching their diet  And they're running up hills  And they're doing constant drills  And they're trying to be  In the best shape  And have the best technique  They possibly can  Now when you're entering  Into this competition  And you're having to fight  Three and four times a night  It takes all that shit  Out of the mix  Now you're dealing with injuries 
[01:25:00]  Now you're dealing with  You know  With luck  Like one guy gets  One punch in  And knocks the guy out  And the other guy  Has to fucking fight  A four round  Or a three round hard decision  It's real hard  To fight more than once  I mean I agree  I mean yeah  I've fought some smaller venues  I mean I understand  It does take a lot out of you  But you know  There's a few changes  Like they went with the gloves  Now I understand  That's you know  To protect their hands  There was a lot of broken  You know fingers  And what not  You know at the beginning  But I mean  Are they  What I'm saying is 
[01:25:30]  Are they forcing them  To do that  To put the gloves on  And you know  And also they went to rounds  You know  It was kind of fun  Just watching them go  And go and go  Until something  Until there was a winner  You know  There's something to be said  For having guys fight  With no rounds  For sure  I understand what you're saying  I mean if you want to look at it  As like just a regular fight  Yeah I mean  Have a fight to the finish  No rounds  No judge  Like one guy taps out  Or doesn't  And you know what  That would be kind of interesting 
[01:26:00]  If they had fights like that  Every now and then  The problem is  For the athlete man  I mean you get guys  That are real close  To each other's skill level  And you fight  You know  You haven't guys  I mean  Hoist Gracie fought  Sakuraba in Japan  They fought for 90 fucking minutes man  And you have these kind of fights  Really  Where yeah  And you take some serious injuries man  And you can't fight again  You might not be able to fight again  For six months or a year  I mean  And you might not ever be  The same guy again ever  You might take  I mean  Two guys might have a decision 
[01:26:30]  And they might fight  To a decision loss  But both those guys  Are ruined  Both those guys  They might have  Ripped ligaments  And get fucking brain damage  And break their hands  And fuck their eye sockets up  You can get really badly damaged  And we have to think about it as  Like if a guy like Chuck Liddell  I want to see that guy fight  Like every few months  I want to see him fight  Every five, six months  Or whatever it is  He's not going to be able to  If you fight like that  If you fight like  As long as  You know  We wanted to 
[01:27:00]  In the old UFCs  Where they had no time limit  There's no way  These guys are going to be able  To fight very often  You got to think about  The health of the athletes  And to protect the athletes  I think the rounds  And all that other stuff  I think it's a good thing  And I think  Giving these guys  Five minute rounds  And then letting them  Recover for a minute  It makes the fight  More exciting  Because they have more energy  When they come back  And they have more enthusiasm  When the second round  Third round starts  But I see what you're saying  I see what you're saying  The whole thing about money  You're talking about  Once you know  The guys that went in debt  44 million  You need sponsorship 
[01:27:30]  You need endorsements  Well not only that  Pay per view  They have a window  They have a three hour window  And pay per view  And man  You could have a fucking  Three hour fight  With some of these guys  You know  I mean two guys  That are really evenly matched  Fuck man  Especially if they know  There's no time limit  They might really pace themselves  You know  And it could get boring as fuck  Yeah that's true  Alright  Yeah maybe I'm just being  A little bit selfish  But it was fun to watch  It was fun to watch man  You could always just  Rent the DVDs  Yeah  Boss wipe your mouth off  You're slobbering  Are you talking to me bitch  Hold on 
[01:28:00]  Did he hang up  He didn't have his headphones on  He said wipe your mouth off  You're slobbering  That's okay  I'm slobbering on the radio  How did you know  Without your headphones on  He was talking about you  Because I'm the only  Slobber in the room  Alright  Nobody else is spinning  It's like a Gallagher concert  When I talk  What else we got dude  Are these all fighting questions  Yeah  That's crazy man  That's how crazy the UFC is man  You talk about weed and drugs  Nobody gives a shit  Rick from California  Go ahead man  Wait hold on Rick 
[01:28:30]  You don't have any questions  About how to get to  Governors of Levittown  Not a one  Check the LIE  Let me check the instant feedback  Nope  None there either  Rick from California  Go ahead  Ray probably  Sure you  What's up dude  Hey what's going on  Joe got a question for you  I've always like  I've been  When I first started  Watching UFC  I always liked watching it  Because you got to  Have different kinds of styles  And everything  I think recently  It's kind of gone towards  Well not recently 
[01:29:00]  But it's a lot more wrestling  Than anything  You know  These guys try to put themselves  On the ground  As fast as they possibly can  And there's like nothing  To actually sit there  And you know  You can watch them wrestle  But that's about the length  Of what you can do  As opposed to K1  Which fights  Are you talking about man  There's more stand up  In the UFC  Than anything  Yeah I think it doesn't  Go to the ground enough  Well I don't know  Because I love watching K1  K1 is nothing but stand up fights  K1's great  They call it  K1 is great man  But there is K1  I mean it's still an option  You can always just watch K1  If you don't like  Watching the ground 
[01:29:30]  No that's fine  But you know  What I'm trying to do  Is I really want to enjoy UFC  But it's just like I said  You sit there and watch them  30 seconds into the round  They're on the ground  Wrestling  And then  You know  That's as far as you can  What's your name  What's your name  After a little bit of that  You just kind of tune it out  You know  Just like okay  Get up  Get up now  And swing some punches  That's what I want to see  What's your name  Ray  Ray  Yeah  Ray this is Opie  Do you listen to the show a lot  Ray  Sure boss 
[01:30:00]  Oh fuck  Well dude  I hear what you're saying  But I disagree  I think  I like  I like watching the whole thing  I like watching  All the options  But a lot of those  Really good K1 guys  They're starting to bleed over  Into mixed martial arts  Mirko Krokop  Who's probably  One of the best guys  If not with the best guy  In pride  Next to Fedor  I mean that guy  Is a top K1 striker  And you know  He's fighting MMA now  And Jerome LeBanner  Is on his way over  Peter Ertz 
[01:30:30]  A lot of those guys  Mark Hunt  He's fighting in MMA  Now in Japan  So we're going to see  A lot of those guys  We're going to see  A lot of those K1 guys  Eventually make it  Into the UFC  Oh that's cool  You know  Like I said  I want to respect to UFC  It's just  No it's like I said  Alright shut up  We heard you  Hey everybody's different  Get rid of him  He said the same thing  Ten times  Shut up  I'll punch out  Alright dude  I like how that guy  Ten times  Didn't want to hurt your feelings  He was like  Why is it hurt my heart  Well because he came on  He goes  Hi opening  Yeah he just said  Hi opening  That's the kind of guy
