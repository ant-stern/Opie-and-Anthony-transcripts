<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a bizarre greeting from an unknown source, quickly transitioning to a discussion about the New York Mets potentially falsifying attendance figures at Citi Field, with listener Bobo’s embarrassing fan interactions mentioned.  A news story about an 80-year-old pilot dying mid-flight, his wife successfully landing the plane, followed, prompting criticism of the news report’s lack of compelling visuals.  The hosts then debated women's admission to Augusta National, arguing against it and suggesting women create their own traditions.  This segued into a broader discussion about changing workplace dynamics, focusing on the perceived negative effects of gender equality initiatives on male-dominated environments and the role of HR departments in suppressing previously accepted behaviors.  A caller from Afghanistan recounted being accused of sexual harassment after saving a female soldier during a mortar attack.  Further discussion revolved around nostalgic memories of less restrictive workplace environments—bosses and secretaries, flight attendants, casino waitresses—and humorous, suggestive names. A call-in guest discussed the Masters Tournament's sponsorship history, followed by more studio discussion on the perceived negative impact of HR departments. The show featured a music selection, a brief mention of Jim Norton's appearance on Hannity, and ended with a backstage argument between E-Rock and Paul over credit for a segment.

The second segment heavily featured an enhanced 911 call from George Zimmerman, with extensive analysis attempting to determine if he used a racial slur.  Tara Reid's cancelled in-studio appearance (due to a claimed flu) was met with skepticism and humorous speculation.  Eugene Levy *was* present. The Mega Millions lottery winner's story, involving a McDonald's employee losing her winning ticket, was discussed, playing news reports and mocking her claims.  The upcoming interview with Clint Hill, a Secret Service agent at the Kennedy assassination, was anticipated. The segment also included numerous tangents: jokes about past on-air statements, a bit about never saying kind words, comments on Kim Kardashian and Marion Barry, and technical difficulties.  Andrew Dice Clay, Cheech Marin, John, Chelsea Handler, Chris Rock, and Paul Mooney were mentioned as potential future guests.  Numerous crude jokes and off-color comments punctuated the segment.

The final segment began with a rambling discussion about a hat and music, abruptly shifting to a bizarre story about nasal chlamydia.  This transitioned to a detailed, graphic discussion about nail guns, their power, range, and potential for accidental self-inflicted injury, including anecdotes about shooting rats. The segment included detailed descriptions of nail gun usage and injuries. A caller, Dave, expressed amazement at the ingenuity of past civilizations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Well, I got a greeting that I had never gotten before.  From the guy.  I got, good morning, good morning.  Yeah.  Here, let me read from the transcript.  Good morning, good morning, good Friday morning.  And then I got, you have a good weekend.  Have a good weekend. 
[00:00:30]  Which I've never gotten before.  Get the papers, get the papers.  Get the papers.  He is just a two-time motherfucker.  He must be at home.  Oh, God.  Lift your clad hood, lift your clad hood.  What's for dinner, what's for dinner?  Good morning.  What is it, good Friday?  Good Friday, good Friday morning.  Is it a good Friday?  It certainly is.  Every Friday is a good Friday.  Shouldn't they distinguish this differently?  I think they should have, but. 
[00:01:00]  Every Friday is a good Friday.  It's a wonderful Friday, I say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How warm is it going to be in New York today?  60?  59, 57 to 59 degrees.  All right.  We can do that.  We're having a normal spring, thank God.  Yeah, yeah.  Started off a little weird, 85 degrees in early March or whatever it was, but.  Hey, my New York Mets.  Your Mets.  I'm kidding.  Stupid Mets.  Now the Mets are just lying to everybody. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  They're a bunch of liars.  They're saying they had the largest crowd ever at Citi Field yesterday.  They're not lying to right.  And a lot of the sports blog sites are going, um, there were a lot of empty seats.  How are they saying there was a sellout and largest crowd ever?  Largest crowd ever?  They're saying largest crowd ever at Citi Field.  And people are calling them out on this?  And I know a lot of these, uh, you know, teams, they like to count tickets sold, not  necessarily, you know, people at the stadium.  Right.  But you can't say largest crowd ever if you're panning the stadium and there's a lot of empty 
[00:02:00]  seats.  Yeah.  So.  It's bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People just bullshit all the time.  That's bullshit.  But, uh, Bobo was there, so that's.  Yeah, I was right.  Wow.  He was, uh, actually, I saw a photograph of the Bobo and, uh, he was at the game and he's,  uh, taking a picture with somebody, um, that stated that Bobo goes around, uh, Citi Field  asking people if they listen to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  That's so embarrassing.  And if they say yes, I gather his next step is, will I Bobo right?  All right.  All right.  You got me snorting around.  He's hilarious.  Well, I'm Bobo right.  I, I, I'm on the show right, but I gotta get back on it right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, you know, I love the Bobo.  I was going to talk about something else, but they got video of the 80-year-old fucking  landing that plane. 
[00:03:00]  You've heard this story, right?  Oh, right, right.  80-year-old, uh, pilot drops dead while he's flying.  His wife's sitting next to him and guess what?  Wife lands the plane.  Yeah.  And has no experience flying.  What's her name?  Helen?  Well, I think her name was Helen.  I'm trying to land the aircraft.  Ah, dumb old brood.  But they were able to, uh, you know, give her a quick, uh, lesson and she landed the  damn thing.  I, uh, she did nose it. 
[00:03:30]  With her dead husband right next to her.  She did nose it in, I think.  Well, I mean.  Didn't she?  All right, but she's alive.  She walked away.  Right.  Are they going to show it or are they going to cut right before they fucking land?  I'm in aviation.  Why?  And she kept her cool.  Colin suffered only minor injuries.  Wow.  All right, coming up.  Why didn't they show, they showed the fucking plane flying overhead.  Yeah.  They showed it lining up on the runway and coming down, kind of hot.  It was coming fast.  Yeah.  And then they cut away and go, well, she landed the plane. 
[00:04:00]  Show it, fuck on.  Is that really the plane footage or is that somebody else?  You think that was like a react?  No, that looked like the footage.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  We might have it right here.  80-year-old lands plane after her husband passes out.  Not passes out, dies.  Why are they saying passes out?  Oh my God.  They put a plane in the air, so they're kind of like following her and stuff and talking to her and all that shit.  Yeah.  This thing is, uh, here we go.  All right.  Milwaukee. 
[00:04:30]  Sturgeon Bay woman is recovering tonight.  A day after her husband had a heart attack in the cockpit of their airplane.  Just a few minutes.  It's going to be a heart attack or something.  12 News Colleen Henry reports, new at 6, another Sturgeon Bay couple helped her land the plane safely.  Oh.  As the plane circled down to Sturgeon Bay, emergency dispatchers were sending out a wide call for help.  They're cutting law enforcement.  This is Denise.  There's a little bit of a situation up at the airport there right now.  A lady helping her airplane.  Her husband was a pilot.  And she thinks she's having a heart attack right now in the air. 
[00:05:00]  John and Helen Collins were nearly home.  Helen Collins.  In Florida when 81-year-old John lost consciousness at the controls.  He is unconscious at this time now.  He is unconscious now?  Yeah, and the aircraft's circling right now.  She doesn't know how.  Does anybody there able to talk her through it?  She, once the initial call, she said she is not a pilot.  It's her and her husband only.  Oh my God.  And she does not know anything about flying whatsoever.  When the Collins family gathered at the airport below, another husband and wife team arrived to help bring the plane down. 
[00:05:30]  It was a very surreal situation.  Was it?  Everybody was calm.  Kathy Bucsonovic is an A.A. inspector and flight instructor.  She coached Helen Collins by radio from the ground.  I got the feeling that John was slumped.  They suck.  They totally suck.  They actually had audio of the woman and everything.  She was able to manipulate the controls with him slumped over it.  Bucsonovic's husband, Rob, is a former Midwest Express pilot and an instructor.  He was also a friend of John Collins.  A very excited aviator. 
[00:06:00]  Who cares about this part of it?  No radio, no video on the plane.  Oh my God.  Useless.  Useless.  Useless.  Who picked this clip?  Sam.  But she dented that fucking thing up.  What happened?  She collapsed the nose gear.  Typical broad.  Oh, really?  The minute that the EMT extracted her, or egressed her from the aircraft.  Egressed her. 
[00:06:30]  Worst news clip ever.  Horrible, boring.  Holy shit.  An exciting story.  Most boring news clip I've ever seen.  Is the guy alive?  Rescue workers took both Collins to the hospital.  This is a completely different story.  He found dead and treated Helen for minor injuries.  Yeah, he's dead, right?  Okay.  In Sturgeon Bay, Colleen Henry, WYSA.  They actually have audio of her going, well, I, all right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  I'll do what you say.  Yes, I'm trying to launch the aircraft.  Ask me about my grandson. 
[00:07:00]  Old people.  Their grandkids.  Shut up.  They're proud of their grandchildren.  Of course they are.  My grandma used to walk around with a sweatshirt.  With every name of our grandkid on it.  When I land, I'll give you some more of these originals.  They're always giving candy.  The charm bracelet.  My grandmother had the charm bracelet, one for each of her.  Oh, yeah.  Five of our heads.  Tinkling, tinkling as she's working the controls.  Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.  Her husband's lifeless body going back and forth on the wheel. 
[00:07:30]  Well, do you think she had to push the body over to get to the controls?  No, they said on the news report there that he was slumped over the controls.  The controls, right.  And she had to literally kind of move him.  He was moving.  That's what I mean.  Push him over.  Yeah.  How do you think you move a dead body?  You just push him over.  No, she didn't push him.  What'd she do?  She just left him on the controls.  And when she was moving the stick, he would go forward and backwards because he was leaning  on the fucking controls.  So did she sit on his dead lap or behind him?  No, you could fly from the co-pilot seat.  But she doesn't know that.  Well, there's a wheel in front of you. 
[00:08:00]  I guess she assumed that's what works it.  Oh, I gotcha.  I gotcha.  It's like, hey, what's this thing in front of me?  But don't you have to push a button so then you could take control?  Nah, you could just control it from there.  Is this a better one where she's talking?  I don't know yet.  I don't know.  All right.  That has a heart attack.  That sucks.  A heart attack can die.  Up in the air.  It's probably her yapping that did it.  Shut up, Helen.  The last thing you ever heard was, that cloud looks like a labradoodle.  But, I mean, if you're 80, odds are something could happen while you're flying. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, perhaps, you know.  So that's got to be some scary flying for everyone else.  Spend as little time in the air as possible.  Right.  All right.  I wonder how often that happens when people are alone in the plane.  And they probably wouldn't know because they get so fucked up in the crash.  But, yeah, that would be fucked up, you know?  Yeah, of course.  It's just an unguided missile.  Yeah.  I got to admit, I think, finally, that we fucking just live in a different world than everyone else. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah?  I just don't get it.  And I'm talking about, like, you know, we're part of the media, I guess.  But no one thinks like us.  So I think we're fucked up.  Yeah?  Yeah, because you got to start thinking and looking at things differently after a while.  This Augusta thing?  Yeah.  Everyone agrees women should be allowed in Augusta.  I just don't see it.  Another one I just don't see.  I don't agree with it.  Not at all.  I think guys should have, you know. 
[00:09:30]  Guys should have places they could go and just be guys.  Not be.  That's all that's about.  Yeah, not be hassled.  Right.  Because you know that's what happens.  I'm for equal rights for women and all that shit and the glass ceiling crap and let's not pinch their hineys anymore.  Pinch their hineys.  But this shit, I don't get it.  Like, if women are so powerful, why don't they go, you know what, Augusta, fuck you.  We don't need you.  We're going to start our own tradition.  Yeah, we'll start our own golf club thing. 
[00:10:00]  You know?  Because like you said yesterday, it's not just allowing women into a man's, like, clubhouse.  Yeah.  And then let them just be men like we're men.  Then everything changes after that.  Right.  It all of a sudden becomes a place now that guys can't do what they were doing previously.  If women were allowed in these clubs and everything remained exactly the same for the guys, the guys had no more restrictions than they had before the women came in, there wouldn't be an issue. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Who cares if they fucking want to be out there on the golf course or fucking, you know, in the clubhouses, whatever, wherever.  Well.  But it changes so drastically what guys can do and the trouble they can get in by doing what they had been doing for years.  Right.  The rules become different.  You have to have the rules become different.  That's the problem.  If they would sign some kind of contract, like, look, these guys don't feel like changing anything.  I'm being harassed.  If you want to be part of that.  Right. 
[00:11:00]  And you say, who cares?  I mean, I worked around a golf course a long fucking time and a lot of us have played golf.  The fact remains, it's usually a woman in front of you slowing down everything because they just can't hit the ball as far.  Yep.  That's what happens.  Most of them.  There's a few out there.  Oh, there's some bruisers.  That can hammer it.  But in general, they just can't.  And it slows down play.  They cut off that left tit intentionally so they can bring their arm around closer to their body.  Right.  But if you say this on TV, they're going to fucking crucify you.  Like, what's wrong with you? 
[00:11:30]  These guys don't want their wives there.  That's why they don't want women there.  Because then their wives would want to come and this is the chance to get away from them.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with getting away from your girlfriend, your wife.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why do people see a problem?  There's nothing wrong with that.  And then women, you know, they start their own gyms and you ask them and they'll say,  well, we were sick of, you know, guys undressing us with their eyes.  But that's fine.  It's hard to do.  And it hurts.  Ow. 
[00:12:00]  I'm like trying to unbuckle a bra.  You're blinking.  There's a button in your eye.  Oh, you're cutting your fucking cornea.  But we're not...  Right, Anthony.  Get it.  But we're not rising up going, oh, you know, we should be able to go to those clubs too.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So if you want true equality, then you should have the mindset of like, who gives a fuck  they don't allow us to do this and that and let's start our own stuff.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I really don't.  Because even stupid Obama has to pipe up about it and Romney, oh, they should absolutely 
[00:12:30]  allow women and, you know.  Meanwhile, they're full of shit.  You think?  If you sat them down?  Yes.  If they're real.  If they were talking like real guys without being in the public eye, they'd say the same  thing.  Stop it.  You're not so fucking progressive.  Right.  Although Obama might not want it, you know, because...  Well, he might have had some issues.  But Romney, please.  Yeah.  Romney loves a good exclusive fucking...  Oh, my God.  Romney would absolutely...  Non-inclusive club.  Romney would absolutely think differently.  Yeah.  If you had him in a bar somewhere having a beer with that guy. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And the Jews.  Right.  That's all just bullshit.  But I don't get it.  No one's saying this.  We're saying this.  Yeah.  We're saying it.  We're saying it.  Are people too scared to say that?  Yes.  It's the day and age we live in.  It's almost a little, you know, example of what me and Jimmy were discussing yesterday about  repercussions that happen when you talk about things.  You speak up.  Now, we can talk about it because the context of this show is very different than what these  politicians deal with. 
[00:13:30]  We're assholes.  Right.  But...  I don't know if we're assholes.  I think we're pretty damn honest.  We're looked at as assholes.  Yeah, but a lot of people look at these stupid news shows and think they're getting an honest  opinion on something.  No, they're not.  I don't believe it at all.  But if you come out like that, there'll be demonstrations, fucking letters being written  and threats, and then you could lose your job.  And you should absolutely be allowed to voice your opinion on whether you want women at Augusta  or any other club that's not inclusive like that.  Right.  And like Jimmy said, they're with their wives. 
[00:14:00]  Sometimes you just want to get away from the wife.  You know, there's a guy in my building who, he's like kind of my real estate guy, and  he plays golf, and he's always like, hey, you want to, you know, love to, you know, bring  you to my course and we'll play a run of golf.  I'm like, yeah, that sounds cool.  And then one day I kind of asked about membership, because me and my brother over the last few  years were like, you know, we should, we love golf so much, we should try to like  get a membership somewhere.  So I asked him about it.  He goes, well, and then he had to awkwardly tell me that it's a Jewish club. 
[00:14:30]  And I'm sorry, you can't come.  It's a Jewish club.  And, and you pretty much have to be Jewish or you have to jump through a, an incredible  process to, to be, become a member there.  I didn't get pissed off.  I'm like, oh, all right.  All right.  You got to convert.  Yeah.  I'm like, eh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll look somewhere else.  I don't care.  You should have elbowed him and said, who wants to hang out with a bunch of Jews, right?  Right.  Who wants to hang out with a bunch of Jews anyway?  We're elbowing him in the arm the whole time.  Guys, a bunch of cheap fucks.  Just my experience when I was a caddy. 
[00:15:00]  Give me a stickle of ball cleaner.  Right.  So that shit's still happening, but, but we're not fucking rising up and getting all pissed  off as guys.  I don't, I don't care.  It's a Jewish club and I'm not allowed.  Right.  Who cares?  I'll find another place.  Find another one.  Exactly.  That's just it.  Enough of these people already.  I mean, it sounds like, you know, the members of Augusta are a bunch of assholes, by the  way, you know, yeah, let's put that on the table as well.  And they would look, they wouldn't look at us at all. 
[00:15:30]  Women at Bushwood.  We would absolutely, absolutely not be members of Augusta.  But with that said.  Who is members of Augusta?  Like, who is Woody Johnson?  Like, what does that guy do?  I don't know.  Or was he?  Woody Johnson.  Isn't that the guy who runs Augusta?  Dick fucking references there in that name?  No.  Jesus.  But what did he do before that?  Dick Woody Johnson.  Right.  Like to be.  Woody Turgeon Johnson.  Dick Woody Johnson's a member.  Wait a minute.  What?  You're not a fan of the dick names?  Nah. 
[00:16:00]  You come across one every once in a while in your life, and it just makes you giggle.  It doesn't matter how old you are.  Yeah.  It's like, you go through life with that name?  What?  I know.  Beat up in school.  You know him, Sam?  What is it?  Dick Trickle?  Woody W.  Dick Trickle was another one.  Oh, yeah.  Dick Trickle, the race car driver.  I was like, how do you go through life with the name Dick Trickle?  Especially when you were a kid and they announced your last name first.  Trickle Dick.  Right.  Trickle Dick.  Richard, it's Richard Dick.  Yes, please.  Trick L.  Fucking, your name is Symptoms for Chlamydia. 
[00:16:30]  Dick Trickle fucking owns it, though, man.  He goes through life as Dick Trickle.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess we're just dopes.  Yes, we are.  D.I.E.?  But every once in a while, you know, this issue comes up with Augusta that they should allow  women in to be members.  I guess I've been told through the Twitter that you're allowed to play as a woman, I guess.  Yeah.  I think.  They let women on the actual course.  Not a lot, though, I'm sure.  I'm sure it's like, you know.  Yeah, I'm sure they can ration that out. 
[00:17:00]  We used to have Ladies' Day at the Huntington Crested Club.  Tuesday was Ladies' Day.  Must be great.  Where they got privileges.  Whee!  And guys basically weren't allowed to play until, you know, later in the day.  That's a peach, hon.  Yeah, so.  A few.  Yeah, let's go to this guy real fast.  It's Mark in Michigan.  Mark.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Mark.  You know, I don't remember why.  I think there were some protesters out front.  But one year at the Masters, basically Augusta just told the sponsorships to go blow. 
[00:17:30]  And they didn't have sponsorship for one year because there was so much controversy around it.  So they just went sponsorless for one year.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't care about the money.  They have the money there, man.  Yeah.  All right.  But I respect that.  Hey, if they're willing to do that.  Yeah.  And it is their club.  Yeah.  But the PGA could just play without Augusta if they technically wanted to, right?  They could just go, we're not doing a tournament here anymore.  Right.  But Augusta, would Augusta care?  They might care about that.  Look, I mean.  I mean, I don't know enough about golf. 
[00:18:00]  I would say the majority of – here we go.  Ah, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  The majority of problems in the workplace are caused by women.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Guys did not invent human resources.  Holy shit.  We didn't need human resources.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That is a fact.  I don't even talk to women at SiriusXM because I don't want to fucking go to the human resources. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, man.  That's where I'm at in my life.  I go – I just say hi, I nod, and I move past.  Hey, I agree with you there, Joel Steinberg.  Whoa.  Hey.  Whoa.  All right.  We understand how you feel about women.  Hey.  Whoa.  Every once in a while, you get some fucking chode of a man that goes to human resources.  Yeah, it's very rare.  But in general, it's always – that's a female thing.  I was harassed.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  Shit it.  If it was up to me, I'd bring us all back to the Mad Men days.  Absolutely.  I was going to say 1500s.  Yeah, it's a modern thinking.  That Mad Men looks like a lot of fun.  Those days, they're smoking.  They're just fucking the secretaries.  They're pinching A's.  All the bosses had alcohol in their offices.  Yeah, they just got, you know, sit down, have a drink.  We're working.  Why not?  Remember all the sitcoms?  Oh, yeah.  They always had a drink in the office.  A drink.  With the boss. 
[00:19:30]  Make it a double.  Larry Tate would come over all pissed off that some fucking campaign was falling through.  Sam, make me a double.  You know, and a lot of the women that listen to our show, I don't think they're the problems.  But, I mean, we all have a fucking story from our jobs.  Yeah.  We all have one.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, we've watched it over the years.  We've watched it completely change, where now you can't hang anything in your cubicle, all that shit.  Guys didn't start that.  Nope. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Didn't.  And then, it is, you are right in your archaic, women-hating, misogynistic way of saying it.  Guys didn't start that, and then you go to a garage to get your car fixed, and it used to be some, you know, hot chick calendars.  Now, like, just some lame car calendar or whatever.  And you talk to those guys, and they're like, yeah, man, we were told we had to clean up the fucking shop and take down our calendars and our pictures and stuff.  Who said that?  Guys or girls?  Vivid memories. 
[00:20:30]  Vivid memories as a kid of my dad yelling and drunk.  But also, driving into the garage to get the car worked on, and I used to get a little thrill, because you look in that big red snap-on tool fucking toolbox, and when they opened the top, there was, like, Playboy centerfolds taped up to the box there.  And you were hoping it took him forever to find that wrench?  Where?  I know it's in here somewhere.  Well, let me see.  I need a three-quarter-inch socket.  I'm trying.  I'm like...  As a little kid, you're just breathing heavy. 
[00:21:00]  You're just...  Just looking at big fucking tits.  Why didn't you ask him to close those lids?  Oh, that's upsetting.  Close that.  I'm very offended.  Man.  The phones are lit, because everyone has a story.  I'm telling you.  We don't even have to do the phones this time around.  Yeah.  I never heard of human resources in all my years of working.  That's not a guy thing.  It's terrible.  That was not a guy thing.  No. 
[00:21:30]  No.  Were guys so out of control?  Because I don't know.  Because I've never had a real job in my life.  Were guys so out of control in the workplace that they just had to do this?  How do you think it started?  It started by women saying, look, we don't have equal rights in the workplace.  Right.  There's a glass ceiling.  We want to be equals.  Then they came in and saw what this boys' club thing was about.  It upset them, because they fucking rarely ever have a sense of humor, and started making problems. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  I think also, as a kind of a backlash, like, oh, you had the power for so long.  Now, watch what I do.  Watch the power I have to fucking take away all your fun times here in the office.  And then it just mutated into, you can't put a fucking American flag on your cubicle.  Right.  And all that shit happened.  Well, because now you've got the human resources department.  And they're not going to stop there, because their whole job is to think of other shit. 
[00:22:30]  It's got to be other shit.  Now you're going to offend people from other countries.  The whole job is to think of other shit.  You're going to offend people.  You know what?  No more pictures of, here's the memo.  No more pictures of children, of your children, allow in the cubicle, because there probably  are women that are barren, and their wombs are dumpsters, and they can't have kids, and  that would upset them.  And you think I'm kidding about that?  There are actually policies in certain workplaces where no pictures of children, because it will  upset women that can't have children.  Really?  What the fuck? 
[00:23:00]  Really?  How is a pedophile supposed to work if you can't have pictures of kids up in your cubicle?  How fucking, but how ridiculous is that?  You have to, I'm sorry that you're barren, it's sad, but.  Yeah.  Pick two, I put pictures of two rotten eggs, and say, then deal with this.  Jesus.  Deal with this.  Or just an empty warehouse.  An oven with cobwebs in it.  Oh my god.  Not a bun to be found.  I just, uh, oh that's hilarious. 
[00:23:30]  Just have an empty egg carton on your desk.  Just tell it out, what is that about?  Oh well, you know Mary's.  This is for that you know what down the hall.  Or a photo of a crib in a box up against the wall.  Jesus.  Unused.  A little note on it, remember to return.  Oh my god.  Oh shit.  But it's the extreme minority that gets all this done, which we've said many, many times 
[00:24:00]  in the show.  Because I'm sure the women that are having problems having kids, most of them would just  accept pictures in the workplace.  And they're not the majority of people.  They would be okay with it.  It's amazing how one or two people in an environment, in a little microcosm, are the people that have  to be, you know, catered to, to the, you know, uh, to the inconvenience or, you know, lack  of fun of everybody else.  And here's another thing.  When did cleavage not, uh, uh, not become a, a, a sexual object? 
[00:24:30]  Well, you're not allowed to look at it.  But it's.  Don't fucking look at it.  No matter how much they hang out.  That's, that's, that's a sexual part of our body for guys.  Is it?  But now we're not allowed to look.  They come to work with their fucking cleavage hanging out.  And now if you stare a little too long, guess what?  You're going to the HR.  Puffin stuff?  HR puffin stuff.  He's your friend when things get rough from what I hear.  Uh, all of a sudden that's not a, you know, a sexual object anymore. 
[00:25:00]  The cleavage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to, you know, sneak the peek in the old days.  It was like, ah, here comes my secretary.  Oh my God.  Mary.  Wow.  You're a little, who are you looking good today?  You could tell a woman that little whistle down the hallway and she'd turn around and  shake her finger at you.  A little smile, the pen in her mouth.  Oh, she'd bend over a little bit and stick her ass out.  All right.  Maybe I'm getting carried away.  You know who wrecked it?  The guys who started stalking or the guys fucking ultimately just pushed, pushed like it, but 
[00:25:30]  it was a small amount of psychotic guys that wouldn't stop the guy that would approach  the secretary every day.  Why won't you just go out with me?  Why won't you?  And she has to go home to her husband.  I think he wants to bite me.  Why won't you just go out with me?  Why won't you just go out with me?  Agreed.  But then, yeah, agreed.  But then it just keeps getting pushed forward.  And, you know, and again, that's the minority more and more and it gets taken away.  And I feel bad for the bosses and the CEOs that have to now just hire ugly secretaries. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  They used to just, they just used to hire bombshells to be around their job.  There are certain jobs that only had very attractive women working there.  Stewardess.  Right.  Your flight attendants.  Right.  You know, stewardess is when they were called that.  We talk about it a lot, how airlines sold the fact that they had sexy stewardess.  Yeah.  Now, women decided, like, I don't like this age discrimination.  So now you got fucking old Betsy giving you your goddamn drinks.  You know what, Ann?  I can't tell you the last time I saw. 
[00:26:30]  A sexy stew.  A sexy stew.  Exactly.  I just flew a couple times in the last month.  They were all just fucking dog ugly.  Old women or gay men?  Yeah.  Like, come on, man.  That used to be an industry where you had bombshells.  Where's Heidi flying me?  And then all of a sudden, she would, like, Ben, let me help you with your.  Coffee, tea, or me?  Ha, ha, ha.  Looks like that seatbelt's a little loose.  Let me help you with that.  Let me help you.  You should really buckle your seatbelt, sir.  Bends all the way. 
[00:27:00]  She grabs your fucking seatbelt thing and brushes your cock as she tightens it up.  You're looking at the cleavage.  The guy across the aisle is looking at her ass.  Everyone's happy.  Everyone's hanging their head out in the aisle.  Right.  Fucking drink cards banging off of people's skulls because they're trying to look at the A's.  Now you don't even look up when they come by.  Yes, I'll do something inconvenient for you.  I get it.  You got that, Iraq?  Hit that.  I'm Maggie.  Fly me to New York.  You'll love my two 747s to Kennedy. 
[00:27:30]  Fly me.  You'll love Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  You'll love my two 747s.  She's talking about her giant tits, by the way.  Why would you have to say two 747s in there?  You'll love my two 747s on my chest here.  My jumbo jet tits.  Yes.  Who wants big plane tits?  I know.  Exactly.  Those giant fucking nose cones.  Don't we have the beep version of that where we make it sound like she's...  Oh, right.  You have that?  Thumbs up, Iraq?  I want to hear that version.  I'm Maggie.  You'll love my two 747s. 
[00:28:00]  Fuck me.  Fly Maggie.  Fuck Maggie.  She was accepted, though.  Oh, yeah.  They had commercials about it.  They're like, yeah, we know this business has nothing but bombshells, and we're going  to try to tell the world that our airline has the best bombshells.  The best bombshells.  My voice is changing like I'm a fucking kid again.  Time to change.  And secretary is the same thing.  Yeah, around the workplace.  It was always, you know, there was the naughty boss that would have the secretary take dictation 
[00:28:30]  sitting on his knee, and she would just be like, oh, now, and he'd put his hand on her  leg, and she'd just tap it.  Now, what are you doing?  All right.  Take a letter.  Why don't you get a little closer here?  Sit on my knee so we don't have any miscommunication.  Okay.  She'd come over with a little stenographer pad.  Wow.  Take this in shorthand. 
[00:29:00]  Work sounds like it used to be great.  It had to be great.  There was alcohol.  Booze.  Women walking around.  Smoking.  Do whatever you want.  Smoking.  Drinking.  Pinching heinies.  Well, Betty, would you like a drink?  Oh, but I don't know.  I'm still working.  That's all right.  I'm the boss.  They have a few laughs.  He pulls his cock out.  He stirs our drink with it.  And it's a can of soda, so it's just uncomfortable for everybody because his dick gets stuck.  And then his shredded penis has to be fixed in the emergency room. 
[00:29:30]  Explain to his wife what happened.  Exactly.  It's a joke gone awry, hon.  Ah, the good old days.  We got a couple dick names coming in.  What?  My wife had a teacher whose name was Harold Richard Wiener.  Oh.  Harry Dick Wiener.  Harry Dick Wiener, that's right.  And then we got the Dick Sweat, of course.  He's a senator from New Hampshire.  I've heard that name before.  Oh, right.  I've heard that one. 
[00:30:00]  Sure, sure.  That's a parent or parents with a sense of humor to name their kid after.  Very cruel.  Name their kid a dick name.  Very cruel.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of another occupation, though, where women were known to just be extremely hot,  and that went away.  Secretaries.  Secretary and stews are the biggest ones.  Waitresses?  No.  Well, cocktail waitresses and bartenders, but that's kind of still.  Yeah, it is.  You ain't making no tips if you're a goddamn dog, motherfucker. 
[00:30:30]  You know what?  It's kind of fun to go down to Atlantic City.  I wouldn't even name.  I've been to a bunch of casinos, so I'm not pointing any out.  I have two perfect examples.  And it's old school.  They hire really good-looking women, and they force them to wear these ridiculous outfits  that really show off their tits and masks.  They show that hiney.  And if you look deep into some of their eyes, they fucking hate it.  They don't like it.  They hate it, but they know how much money they're making.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Where they're really pushing the boobs all the way up and out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And some of these women, they're a little loosey-goosey up there.  The Borgata has the hottest waitresses in Atlantic City.  It's just known.  Don't they weigh them or something like that?  The Borgata babes, when they first came on board, they were like, they have to stay within  a certain weight.  And if they don't, they have time to lose it.  But then if they don't, they get fired.  See, I'm not a total scumbag.  That's kind of...  Well, you don't want...  What happens if she gets... 
[00:31:30]  It's kind of bad.  Think of it this way.  What happens if she blows up?  Gets a little fat.  Then she'd wind up getting XM and being a fan of this show.  No, and I understand that, but the whole weighing them and stuff, that's a little brutal.  Not going to lie to you.  I don't know.  I understand what you're saying.  Oh, my God.  And then the worst waitresses I've ever seen is at the Tropicana.  Oh, really?  They look like fucking diner waitress women.  Like, they might as well have their hair in a Ruth Buzzy net as they serve you drinks.  What happened there? 
[00:32:00]  I don't think they give a shit.  The women got some power.  Yeah.  The women got some power down there.  Jesus, mother...  Who's this?  Of Christ.  This is the Borgata calendar.  Get out of here.  That's the Borgata calendar.  What, do they bring these girls in to work one day?  Are they ringers, you think?  They have to be ringers.  Go back to her fat fucking shapeless leg.  Go back once.  She's really pretty, but her right leg looks like it was fucking like a stretch Armstrong leg.  That fucking right leg is a shapeless lump.  She's probably six foot tall, man. 
[00:32:30]  You think?  These girls aren't waitresses down there.  Oh, my God.  Look at her...  Her boobies.  Who is she?  Oh, well.  Whatever.  The lovely Denise Malani.  An exotic Buxotic.  Yeah.  Denise Malani's got giant cans and a...  I don't know what's going on there.  I don't think she's bringing your drinks out.  They got ringers.  Yes, thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Jimmy Lover.  Oh, that's sweet.  Nurses?  Back in the old days, were they known to be a little sexy?  Like that nurse ratchet?  I think there's some kind of basic archaic idea that they were sexy.  That's why they put on the little nurse uniform in some places and give you enemas.  It's supposed to be sexy.  I think at that point you want an ugly nurse because they probably focused on their learning a little better. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, all you think so, the ugly nurse would be...  You get better care.  I want to make sure they're giving you the proper dose of medicine and shit.  Who do you want shaving you down for that hernia operation, though?  Good point.  Good point.  Just grabbing your dick, flopping it around while they're shaving like it's just an errant sausage in her plate.  Fuck that.  I tackled a female into a ditch so she wasn't mortared, and now I'm being brought up on charges. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, man.  This guy's calling from Afghanistan?  Afghanistan.  Or he's home from Afghanistan.  Tim?  No, I'm calling from Afghanistan.  I made my way to an internet tent that we have set up by the MWR, and I'm on Skype.  Wait, so you guys listen to us over there?  Yeah, I've got a subscription on my computer, so when I get back from a mission or something,  if I have a couple minutes to get online, I can actually pop that.  Hey, how cool is that?  Wow, that is cool. 
[00:34:30]  Tim, thanks for everything you're doing for this fine country of ours.  What?  I support the soldiers.  Who are you with?  100%.  Who are you with, my friend?  101st Airborne.  Ah, Airborne.  Very cool.  So you really got into a situation over there in Afghanistan?  Yeah, you know, I'm all for equality and stuff like that.  You know, when I have females on the battlefield, good.  All I give a shit about is if I get hit, if you're going to be able to drag my butt out of there.  Yeah.  But we had a mortar come in a couple days ago, and I tackled this girl into a ditch. 
[00:35:00]  Hopefully, you know, save her life if it got close enough.  The next day, I found paperwork in my box.  I'm getting brought up on sexual harassment charges because she thought I was trying to  peel her up when I tackled her into a ditch.  Holy shit.  You sound like a normal guy.  Oh, my God.  We've only talked to you for two minutes, but you sound level-headed.  What the fuck is that about?  Did you grab her in such a way where your hands were on her breasts? 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  She's got body armor on.  That's what I don't understand.  That's what I'm on, you know, automatically think.  Hey, who can I sexually harass during the two minutes of terror when the frigging rocket's  coming in?  Yeah, that's exactly what crossed my mind.  Yeah, man.  How could you keep a heart on in those conditions with mortars coming in?  I don't know.  Well, it's just not a good condition.  Is she just trying to get the hell out of there, and maybe they'll make her some kind  of sweet deal to make everything go away? 
[00:36:00]  Like, what's...  That doesn't make sense.  It doesn't, because nothing positive is going to come back on her, because if the charges  get blown out of proportion to where she made them up, she gets in trouble.  If I get charged, I just get kicked out.  I didn't even know this girl, so she would really have no reason to kick me out.  But I think she just wants to suck up to the good man.  And feeling a fucking...  Was she good looking?  ...check up with body armor is pretty impossible.  Yeah.  You can't really feel the gentle curvature of a tit under Kevlar.  Unless you've got really strong hands.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Strong ligaments in your fingers.  Yeah, really get a good squeeze in there.  Well, that's...  Yeah, that ballistic plate, really, you know.  Nothing sexier than a ballistic plate.  Well, that's a pretty unbelievable story there, sir.  Yeah, I couldn't believe that, too, but...  What's your...  What's your...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  What's your day look like?  Like, what are you going to do as a member of the Airborne Division today? 
[00:37:00]  Today, we are doing a presence patrol.  I can't really say where, but...  Oh, I know.  Yeah, it's just when we just...  You go into the town, you talk to the leaders, you know, you can figure out what's going on,  what do they need, and...  Ah, hearts and minds.  Hearts and minds.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  And an occasional bullet in the fucking head!  Pretty much.  You know, let's go out unarmed and, you know, be all nice to them, and then, you know, have  pop shots.  Oh, man, you go in unarmed? 
[00:37:30]  We go in very, very lightly armed.  For a presence patrol, the Channing Command says, we don't want to scare the people.  Holy mother of God!  What do you have on you?  What do you got, your sidearm on you?  Yeah, I go in with a nine-mail, that's it.  What do you got, your SIG?  Huh?  What do you...  A Beretta.  Oh, the Beretta?  Yeah.  Yeah, so that piece of crap that falls apart when you fire two rounds.  What a bitch, man. 
[00:38:00]  Ah, well, you got to leave your rifle back at the base?  We have a couple of armored Humvees that go with us, they have 50 cows on them, that's  about as big as we get, and then we have a couple guys with rifles, but if you're actually  going to be talking to the people, get a sidearm, get this, they actually suggest, I've  never done this, but they actually suggest to show your trust to the village leaders that  they're going to protect you, take your helmet off and you talk to them, like, my ass, dude.  Fuck you! 
[00:38:30]  Holy shit!  That's insanity.  Is it true over there, I heard that they gave Viagra to a lot of the guys in the tribal  regions, like a lot of these older guys who would run the areas, and they got information  by giving them Viagra because these guys were able to fuck their wives again.  Yeah, I've never heard of that, but I wasn't going to buy them, you know, we're trying  everything else to be nice to these guys, you know, why not get my heart on?  Yeah, I mean, look, for a guy, what's more impressive when you're a little older than 
[00:39:00]  to be able to get a heart on again?  You know, to show the trust, can you guys tap dance on an IED?  Just do a little tap dance.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  I don't believe we'll turn it off.  Let me go stand on it first.  Yeah, yeah, just drive really fast past anything suspicious.  Unbelievable.  That's insanity, man.  The hands tied behind the back for political reasons.  You'd think Vietnam would have taught people something.  Jesus.  I know.  Oh, man.  It's disgusting.  Well, be safe, my friend, and tell anybody that listens to us hello, and tell anybody 
[00:39:30]  that doesn't to go fuck themselves.  Bravo.  Yeah.  You know, we put you guys on every time we've had a hard day or something like that.  We're like, man, we need a good couple of laughs.  Hard day?  You know what time I get up?  I don't want to hear it.  Exactly.  We're here at 5.30 while you guys are over there enjoying the countryside, relaxing.  Lolli-gagging.  Yeah, hanging out, eating good food, feet up.  It's going to make it tough to bitch after this phone call.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to shut my fucking mouth for now.  Where's my sandwich for the lava god?  Yeah.  I understand things are tough over there, sir, but do you understand? 
[00:40:00]  I've been waiting for egg whites since 6.45.  It's now 6.53.  Outraged.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  No more bitching.  Eight hours ago or something like that.  You know what?  Joe, you're fucking egg white.  Stay safe, man.  All right, man.  All right, Tim.  Yeah.  Be careful.  Bye, Tim.  Tim from Afghanistan.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's amazing, man.  Wow.  It's just that mentality of politicians and goddamn pencil pushers that override generals and 
[00:40:30]  people that know.  I don't know.  It's too bad.  It really is fucked.  Poor guy.  He's got to come in.  Even the PC shit has hit the army and fighting wars.  It's just unbelievable.  You can't fight a PC war.  It just doesn't work.  War is supposed to be vicious and horrific, so it ends quicker.  Right.  So it ends quickly.  Right.  You can't have this antiseptic fucking, we won't, you know, we'll try to do this nicely  war.  It's crazy. 
[00:41:00]  Must be of a Star Trek episode.  Which one?  Well, it's one where two planets were warring, right?  And they realized after years and years and years of warring that not only people die,  but their culture dies.  All their possessions and what makes them a society.  War is horrible for that.  So they worked out an agreement with each other that they would simulate a war so that  the buildings and culture doesn't get destroyed.  But whenever a missile would hit, they'd take that certain area, calculate how many people 
[00:41:30]  would have died, and the people have to report to death chambers and be killed on both sides.  If it doesn't happen, if they don't whip these people up and kill them, the treaty is null  and void and the real bombs start.  But they've been doing this for thousands of years, or hundreds of years, or whatever  the hell it was.  But then Kirk, of course, comes, and he's brilliant, and tells them, look, you assholes, the whole  thing about war is that it's got to be horrible enough to make you want to stop it. 
[00:42:00]  You made it so antiseptic that people just walk into these chambers that it'll keep going  on for years and years and years.  So he blew up the computers that calculate the dead and everything, and people were like,  oh my god, there's going to be real war.  And they were so horrified that they decided to call each other up and sort things out.  No war.  No war.  No war.  See?  No war.  Nice.  And you know who fixed that?  James Tiberius Kirk motherfucker from Iowa, bitch.  Are there any Jews working today?  I don't think so.  Oh yeah, today's good. 
[00:42:30]  I keep forgetting it's good Friday.  I don't think so.  Isn't this a company holiday?  I think it is.  But not for us.  Why isn't it for us?  Well, because we are...  We gave him an hour.  Let's go.  We are.  We really should.  Wait, is this a company holiday?  Kirk always broke the prime directive.  But he knew best.  He did know best.  Yeah.  All right, that's a good start to the show.  I like it.  My sandwich is here, too.  And so are my eggs.  I could stop bitching like that fucking guy from Afghanistan.  Me, me, me, me.  Ooh, I get shot at. 
[00:43:00]  Ooh.  Oh my God.  Oh, you're crazy.  I can...  This is the Open Entry Show.  Show, show.  Get in topical. 
[00:43:30]  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  What's up, sexy?  Good morning.  I don't even know this version.  Stand By Your Man by...  Wendy O. Williams, probably.  And Lemmy.  Oh, this is Lemmy?  Lemmy and Wendy O. Williams.  Oh.  I don't know much about Lemmy. 
[00:44:00]  I know Jimmy knows a lot about Lemmy.  Lemmy.  Were you into Lemmy?  Uh, I wasn't a huge Motorhead fan, but...  I like what I hear.  I like it, and I think Lemmy is a blast.  Right.  He's fun to fucking hang out with.  When we did that casino gig...  Oh my God.  ...and me and him started drinking fucking Jack Daniels, and I was snotted, and he was fine.  He was drinking it like it was coffee or orange juice.  And then in the old days, when I had my band, we opened for Motorhead, and my guitarist 
[00:44:30]  drank with Lemmy backstage before the show, and was so fucking drunk, we don't even know  how he walked out on stage and played.  Did he play well?  Uh, I don't remember.  I was pretty ripped myself.  Okay.  Uh, I was just happy to be there.  Um, it...  You can't out-drink Lemmy.  It's just not gonna happen.  It's, um...  It's just what he does.  Oh, this is a cool cover. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, Wendy, uh, Wendy O. Williams committed suicide 14 years ago.  That's why you're playing this.  And...  And...  Oh, is this a double?  Yeah.  Oh.  Tammy Wynette died 14 years ago?  There you go.  Oh.  What was her man thing?  I forgot.  Good cover.  It's Lemmy and Wendy O. Williams, sir.  Yeah.  What was the Tammy Wynette man thing?  Stand By Your Man.  What was this?  Stand by your man. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, it's good time.  It's the, uh...  Damn it.  The original version.  The country version.  Fuck.  A plus for E-Rock today.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  Whoa.  I had a little help with that, but that's good.  Oh, you did.  Of course you did.  Why would you say that?  Why would you just take the credit?  Right then, I went, oh, he is a piece of shit.  Who helped you?  Like, right then.  Why would you say that?  Who's the smart person that helped you?  Because I'm not a dick like that.  Yes, you are.  Okay, yeah, I'm a dick.  It's all mine.  Who helped you out?  Nobody.  Come on.  Come on, my little company.  Because that person gets the A plus and you get a C minus now.  You just get an assist. 
[00:46:00]  Who helped you?  There's been issues with people helping E-Rock.  Really?  Somebody's very upset because they think they're helping E-Rock with more stuff than E-Rock's giving  them credit for.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that why you said I had help?  That's 100% true.  They're upset with you.  That's why you said I had help.  Oh, oh, oh.  Who's upset with E-Rock?  Paul is.  Huh?  Paul.  Because he said, remember you said that E-Rock got it.  I'm assuming this is Paul's pull.  Because remember when you said that E-Rock got an A plus for getting topical the last time? 
[00:46:30]  That was a long time ago, though.  Apparently, Paul tells me that was his pull and E-Rock did not give him credit.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Paul talks to me every day in the office about the things that E-Rock sends me for this computer.  Yeah.  And he says he's giving them to E-Rock.  Yeah, every single thing.  He says he's sending you a lot.  I don't know if it's true.  My favorite thing on this show is E-Rock fighting back.  I love it, man.  It's great.  I just love it. 
[00:47:00]  Finally.  He's pissed, though.  Paul's pissed.  Is he?  Is he here today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're lucky to have his presence here today.  Oh.  It's the sarcastic E-Rock.  Well, why doesn't Paul get on Mike and defend himself?  Paul?  Come here, Paul.  Same reason why E-Rock's been walking all over him.  Mm.  He's pussy.  Paul, what's the problem?  No, nothing.  Just, uh...  Nothing.  That's not what you say off the air.  Credit doesn't really get handed out.  I'm sorry.  Compliments don't really get handed out around here.  And, uh...  Lately, I've been taking a beating.  So when I do something well, it would be nice to hear something back on it. 
[00:47:30]  So Eric taking credit for what I do kind of bothers me a little bit.  Eric was right.  Sounds like a wah scenario.  Yep.  Wah.  Wah.  You stopped the show very well today.  I want credit.  You can't even fight well.  Oh, man.  Um...  Compliments do not get handed out around this place very quickly.  Oh, hell no.  Oh, never.  They're not readily handed out.  And they get shit on even faster.  Mm.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, there's E-Rock trying to...  After he fucks somebody out of credit, he goes in and tries to act like they're commiserating.  Yeah.  Yeah, these guys get shit on by me.  Constantly.  Heh, heh, heh.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Jim Norton was on Hannity last night.  Yes, I was.  Yes.  We were all watching.  At my abode.  And he says hello to everybody.  He really does like you guys.  Does he?  He asks about you a few times.  Tell him I said hi.  Well, I can't.  I'm here now, but...  Oh.  Maybe I should have told you that ahead of time. 
[00:48:30]  And you set the ONA world on fire with a quick chip slash Uncle Paul impression.  In two different places.  I knew just one quick one wouldn't interfere with what I was doing on the show.  And I was hoping that the ONA fans would get it, and they did.  I was hanging out on Twitter as you were on Hannity, and man, my fucking feed just  exploded.  People lost their minds.  And it was one word, I think.  That's it.  Here it is.  Let him implement Sharia law.  I mean, when Mubarak fell, who do we think was going to take over? 
[00:49:00]  The Kiwanis Club or something?  I mean, we knew.  Or something.  You want to do chips so bad on TV, I think.  I like sneaking him in, though, because...  Oh, yeah.  But it's like, I was thinking as I'm saying that, because I thought of that joke, or just  that point, really, more than a joke, and I'm like, how can I get...  And it just, it felt right.  And you guys might not be able to hear, but there are camera guys actually laughing sometimes.  Oh, because they know the gag? 
[00:49:30]  No, but they're also used to hearing just such stiff answers that they appreciate any  kind of humor.  I mean, if it's halfway funny, because they're just hearing such political points all the  time.  Yeah, yeah.  Was Sean nervous to have you on?  No.  He gets nervous sometimes.  He actually, Sean is really nice to me, man.  Like, he'll always, when I'm with the other guests, no matter who they are, he'll always  ask them, because he always teaches me next to him, and he'll always go, you guys know,  you guys ever see Jimmy on Leno?  He's really great.  My wife and I love him.  He's a little raw, but he's great. 
[00:50:00]  And he always tells me, like, you're one of the only guys that comes on and knows the  line.  Like, I think he's still trying to reiterate, like, you're on Fox, he panics.  Right, right, yeah.  Because he's a panicky Pete.  But he really is, he treats me very well when I'm there.  Like, he treats me like, he makes me feel like I'm welcome there and that he's happy  to have me.  Yeah, yeah.  So, people who don't like him politically, all right, I get it.  But he's a really, he's not a dick.  The guy's a great guy.  No.  He's a good guy.  I hate when people just smash handily.  It's like, you guys never met him?  What are you talking about?  He stuck up for us.  Yes, he did.  Huge ratings.  A couple times now.  He stucks up for most free speech things, at least with radio guys. 
[00:50:30]  And he even said to me, regular radio is tough nowadays.  Yeah.  Because you guys are better off where you are.  It's hard.  You've got to be so fucking careful of what you say.  It's bullshit.  Bullshit.  It's bullshit.  CNN enhances the George Zimmerman 911 call.  Now that, yeah.  I was going to say, now they're saying, but I was going to let you play it instead of giving  away.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because a lot of people thought George Zimmerman said coon.  It sounded like it, but here's where his lawyer went wrong. 
[00:51:00]  He said that he said fucking goons.  And I'm like, no, that was a coon.  So like, when the lawyer responded with that, it's like, no, there must have been coons.  But now they're saying no.  Well, they enhanced it, and here we go.  This is Brian Stone.  He's one of our senior audio engineers, expert in this field.  Sure.  And you have enhanced the tape.  And we're going to listen to this.  I have not listened to this tape either.  Two weeks ago when we did this, I didn't listen to it because I wanted to listen to it  for the first time in this equipment.  The second version that's been enhanced I haven't listened to.  Let's play it.  Are you following him? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Now, that certainly sounds much clearer than the first tape we listened to.  Right.  It's extremely clear now.  Some are accusing George Zimmerman of using the racial slur coons in his 911 calls.  Hey, at least the guy said it.  Some are accusing him of using the racial slur coons.  As opposed to the animal.  People didn't think he was saying the animal. 
[00:52:00]  They thought, we got it.  Just say coons.  We don't know what coons is.  At least he said it.  Yeah, I agree.  And he obviously isn't saying porch monkey, jungle bunny.  He just uses it as an excuse to blur everything.  Every racial epithet.  Was he saying jigaboo next?  On CNN.  We're going to see if Spear Chucker comes through loud and clear.  And he just goes all over.  He mumbled faggot two weeks prior.  I think this just gave Anthony an excuse. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, it could have.  You know, I could check a few more off my I said it on radio checklist.  Is there anything we haven't said on this show?  I don't think so.  I can't think of anything.  Anything nice.  Maybe like have a nice day.  Yeah.  I don't think we've ever said that.  How are you?  And it's good to see you.  I think those words have never been uttered in this room.  Kenny's smart.  Yeah, exactly.  Looking good, Iraq. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, that was fast, Sam.  Anthony and sobriety in the same sentence.  Yes.  See, because I drink.  I understand.  I can't explain that.  I got it.  Yes.  This 911 call.  It was preceded by the F word.  Can we play it again?  Can you repeat it so we can hear it a few times?  Okay. 
[00:53:30]  Fucking cold.  Is this poltergeist?  That's fucking cold.  It's fucking cold.  Fucking cold.  Because they said it was rainy and unseasonably chilly in Florida that night.  So it does make sense.  It was like that.  And he's on the phone.  Why did he say that on the phone?  That never made sense.  It's like, for him to go, it's fucking cold.  But what a weird time to start talking about the weather.  Well, when you're just standing there, it's like to yourself, you'd be like, it's fucking 
[00:54:00]  cold.  Oh, oh, okay.  I didn't get that.  I mean, that was just a dumb joke.  Oh, the low pressure system moving in from there.  Right.  I understand why.  Oh, it's counterclockwise direction.  We'll bring cold northern air into our area.  Here's some other things that have never been said in this room.  Good point, Steve.  And thanks, Gary.  Stupid Gary.  Dumb Baldy.  Oh, geez.  I wouldn't say that.  Oh, sorry.  I thought we were just throwing him into the joke.  Oh, I just thought it was time to make fun of him again.  Awkward now. 
[00:54:30]  Went too far.  Yeah.  With this new clearer audio, it's apparent the first word is a curse word.  So we'll bleep it out for the rest of the story.  Thank you.  It's the second word that's important to hear.  I don't want to say what it sounds like this time, what a lot of people are saying it sounds like.  But let's play it a few times so the viewer can have an idea for themselves and make their own conclusion.  Oh, get out. 
[00:55:00]  Get out.  Stop for a second.  Now, it does sound less like that racial slur.  Last time I announced that it could have been that slur.  From listening in this room, and this is a state-of-the-art room, it doesn't sound like that slur anymore.  Right.  It sounds like, and we wanted to leave it up to the viewer, but it sounds like we're hearing the swear word at first and the word cold.  And the reason some say that would be relevant is because it was unseasonably cold in Florida that night and raining. 
[00:55:30]  Can we play it a few more times?  Sure.  That sounds like cold.  It absolutely does.  Yeah.  Sure does.  And it makes more sense in that moment because he knew he was on a 911 call.  And now they also enhanced the other video, and they said it does look like there's an injury on the back of his head.  What?  Nothing.  What?  Comments.  Comments. 
[00:56:00]  No, no.  You know the racist comments come in every so often.  It's hilarious.  Fuck it.  I love it.  Something about ashy knees.  What else has never been said in this room?  Hey, the shade guys are early.  Jerry loves this.  I love it.  Oh, God.  I wish Roland would book a guest.  Right. 
[00:56:30]  Enough with your guests.  Enough with your goddamn guests, Roland.  No, I thought you said that you wanted him.  I do want to acknowledge that we were supposed to get the entire cast of American Reunion.  I remember him saying they're all coming in.  I go, all of them?  Because the whole cast will be on the show.  We got Eugene Levy.  Yeah.  And Tara Reid was supposed to be today, but she's got the flu, supposedly, which we're not believing.  I got the flu.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, guys. 
[00:57:00]  I got the flu.  So we went from having the entire cast down on Eugene Levy.  Eugene Levy.  A few of the other cast members were around, but they were coming in later.  But didn't he say we were going to get the whole cast in at the same time?  Yes.  I believe he did say that.  All right.  Yeah.  And I love how Roland will profess to know intimate flight details.  Oh, yeah.  Where are they?  Hey, he was booked on the red eye.  But there was a problem he had with his agent, so his flight changed.  He had to reroute. 
[00:57:30]  Like, what?  I didn't know that.  You're just saying words.  Runway 19er was closed down for maintenance, and they stacked them up over a staging area,  and the planes came.  The tracks developed in the 767 wings.  They had to cancel the flight.  They found some new equipment.  Let me punch that up for you.  Okay.  Roland, the travel agent.  Yes.  Just saying anything. 
[00:58:00]  Dummy.  You guys want an update on the Mega Millions woman?  Oh, the one from McDonald's?  We have another update.  McDonald's.  Where were we at with this lady?  Wishing she was dead.  Her did.  Yeah.  Well, right after the Mega Millions record-setting $600 million drawing,  she said she was one of three people around the country that won and had a ticket.  Oh, much to the chagrin of her McDonald's co-workers who said she was merely part of a pool of 15 people from McDonald's 
[00:58:30]  that put in to buy these tickets.  She said, I did that, but I also purchased a ticket all by my lonesome, and that was said winning ticket.  I believe that's bullshit, but she says that's what happened.  They are very angry with her, saying that she stole money from them, pretty much.  She says, it's my ticket.  Now, there's speculation as to whether she even has the ticket.  Wasn't it bought in Maryland?  Yes.  At the place she said she bought it? 
[00:59:00]  Right.  But she said she had the ticket, and then she said she hid it in the McDonald's.  It just turned into a real crock of shite.  You think she has it?  I'll tell you why.  Oh, my God.  How much money do you want to bet?  I hope you're right, because I hate her, but how would she have known exactly where it was bought?  Oh, because the news said it.  Did they say that before she came out and said she had it?  The news said it immediately.  Did they?  Oh, my God.  I was up early when the ticket was announced or whatever. 
[00:59:30]  And do they have her on video?  And they had a news guy right outside.  What was it?  A 7-Eleven or something?  7-Eleven.  That was the one where people started taking pictures with the machine, remember?  Yeah.  They know the winning ticket was from that store, but they didn't know who it was at first.  So she might have been watching that particular news broadcast and said, well, I bought a ticket at that place.  Yeah.  The other thing is she said that she wasn't going to go back into McDonald's and grab the ticket until everyone calmed the fuck down. 
[01:00:00]  Then her lawyer admitted that he's not sure there's a ticket because he's trying to save face.  Dude, why would she hide the ticket in the place that the other people feel they were ripped off?  I have an answer for that.  Yes, Jimmy.  Because she's...  Oh, right.  Well, some would call her.  Jimmy, you want to take that bet before I give you the update?  I do not.  No, because I'm hoping that she doesn't.  What the fuck?  What happened?  It's wrong with my iPod.  What does this mean? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Wow.  That's so good.  It's a circle.  A red circle with a red X in it.  Oh, boy.  That is...  No music is what it's saying.  I don't know.  That's so good.  Oh, my goodness.  Why don't you just put the music...  Put that there!  Why don't you just put the music on your phone, my friend?  There's too much fucking room.  I got three million gigs.  So, here's your update.  The Maryland Megan Nut, they're calling her now, who insists she won a record Mega Millions jackpot,  now says she's lost the winning ticket. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that's the new one?  But isn't breaking a sweat looking for it.  I lost that shit!  I have no idea where it is.  I'm not sure I have it.  Merlande Wilson told the Post in her latest tortured explanation.  Of the mystery ticket's fate.  The world's most famous McDonald's employee incredibly claims she hadn't even checked the uniform she was wearing the night she bought it.  I lost that shit!  I'm still looking for it. 
[01:01:30]  Where's my ticket at?  I haven't even looked in my uniform pants yet.  The flaky single mom of seven admitted.  Not mom of seven.  I'm still looking everywhere to find it.  In my purse.  Everywhere.  And she didn't put her kids to work on the treasure hunt, even though they have the week off for spring break.  Oh, where the hell?  Where am I?  Where are my hundred million dollars?  I'll look later.  I'll get my chidgens to help me.  But she even admitted she didn't check her uniform.  That would be the first place, right?  A lotto ticket on your uniform! 
[01:02:00]  Let me see.  When I all of a sudden don't have my wallet, the first thing I do is I check the jeans I was wearing.  Check the clothes you were wearing.  To see if it's in the back pocket there.  This woman is so full of shit.  I want to look for it.  I was crying.  She wouldn't let us.  It's a lot of money.  Said her disappointed daughter, Stephanie, 15.  Mother of five.  That's funny.  Yesterday she sounded strangely serene despite the ticket's mystifying disappearance, leaving her fate to faith. 
[01:02:30]  It's a blessing from God.  If it's meant to be, we'll find the ticket, she said.  No, you won't.  You don't have the ticket.  It's not a blessing from God.  She is a crazy person.  Why is she wearing a trucker's hat?  Well, like Sam.  She just figures it looks good.  Can we hear the audio?  How fucking hateable is this woman?  I want to hear her talk.  I don't think she's hateable at all.  I love her.  Do you think she's nutty?  I love her.  The winning store will receive a big check today.  Hold on.  The boss is talking. 
[01:03:00]  I love her because she's absolutely full of shit, but the media wants to believe so bad that they continue with this.  Instead of saying, all right, look, we got a nut job here.  We got to move on and try to find the ticket somewhere else.  She can go through four things at the same time to try to find it.  Oh, God.  See?  That old gag.  Yes.  But the beauty of the story is that the ticket's still out there.  The person hasn't come forward, which makes this great. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And in Maryland, we'll say it again, you don't have to come forward.  Some states you do.  Yeah.  You have to, but not in Maryland.  You could be anonymous for the rest of your life.  No one has to ever know.  Yeah.  Here's the latest story.  Hit it.  In Maryland, though, have a news conference scheduled for this afternoon, and they've had their doubts about a McDonald's employee who says she won that state's ticket.  She still hasn't forked over that all-important piece of paper.  You know what?  Hold on for a second. 
[01:04:00]  That picture looks exactly like my hair and hat from AAF.  Oh, God.  Absolutely.  There you go.  Yeah, okay.  Let her rip.  She also looks a little bit like the hooker that got, what's his name?  Oh, yes.  That boring English actor.  Oh, Hugh Grant.  Hugh Grant.  What was her name?  Divine Brown.  Divine Brown.  Motherfucker.  She looks a little bit like Divine Brown.  I'm Brown, and I'm Divine, motherfuckers.  Uh-oh.  Roland looks pissed. 
[01:04:30]  We were just joking, Roland.  Don't fucking kill us today.  Talking to the microphone or something.  The Angry Panda is about to talk.  The Angry Panda.  I woke up, and I thank God for this glorious day.  What's up, Roland?  Oh, fantastic.  Fantastic.  He's heated.  We're just calling BS on the Tara Reade flute thing.  And we're not pointing our fingers at you because that's the info you got.  But we think that Tara Reade is bullshit.  We think she's full of turkey.  I think.  I agree.  I think her publicist probably said, hey, look. 
[01:05:00]  We got two TVs.  Can't fuck with that.  Blow off the rest.  Did she cancel all radio?  Wait, so is she doing TV today?  She has two TV appearances, like VH1 and some other MTV things.  Today?  Today.  So she's just blowing off radio.  That's right.  Another fucking asshole publicist.  Another fucking asshole publicist that doesn't understand how good radio is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's why I assume so.  And that's this time.  What dummies, man.  Oh, my God, guys.  I would love to come in and do this show. 
[01:05:30]  You guys promote my new movie, American Reunion.  But I think I got the flu.  I think I got the flu.  Like, when Donald suddenly got the flu, right away, halfway through, they go, we're rescheduling.  Don't worry.  It's between Monday and Friday.  Yeah, it's different.  So now that was a quick, like, we're going to...  Do you get frustrated, Roland?  If there was animals, I would have fucking killed one.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, because...  I like to kick bums. 
[01:06:00]  And he's coming off as Bruce High.  Yeah.  So he's, like, on a big downer.  So did you ask why...  Yeah, the sugar high with the Springsteen, and now it crashed.  Well, they said, it's not guaranteed, and not this.  And I said, I know.  I got to take a shit.  You know what it was.  And I just hung up.  The movie needs help.  It's getting really bad reviews.  I know you liked it, Roland, and that's fine, and I'm sure some people will enjoy it.  But to get people...  A mass audience, yes.  A mass audience, it's not getting good reviews.  Oh, my God, it's the best movie I've ever made. 
[01:06:30]  It's wonderful.  I just...  Casey and the whole gang back together again.  I have to tweet it.  I have to tweet.  Oh, hello, London.  We're all here in London, England.  Everybody from American Union, we're going to go...  Fucking just eat the Marlboros.  Just eat them.  Just eat shit at this point.  Is she definitely doing TV today, though?  If she can't do TV, then maybe she's for real.  Oh, yeah.  It's indefinite. 
[01:07:00]  But...  I have to cancel TV.  I have the flu, Jimmy.  I have the flu.  I was like, I wanted to do promotion.  I want to come on your show, but I can't do it.  There's big actors who came in here, like Will Ferrell.  He felt like shit, but he piled through.  So what do you think that's about?  Probably her tummy hurts.  She goes, I just don't want to do anything else.  Period?  Period?  You think it's period?  It could be period blood.  I don't know.  They just don't want to do certain press.  That's all.  When I'm on the road doing press, sometimes I don't want to do it, but I have to.  I just learned that VH1 has a live show on now, a live morning show every morning. 
[01:07:30]  How many people could possibly be watching that?  VH1.  Plus, you do it in the hallway.  It's a weird show.  Another dumb fucking publicist who thinks TV is better because it's TV.  They're just uneducated dummies.  So that's why we're waiting for this morning to see if she did do it, then go back on our  internet, see the two, we know the two shows she's supposed to do.  What time is she supposed to do VH1?  See, the company should make these publicists suffer.  I don't care.  They absolutely should get back. 
[01:08:00]  I don't give a fuck to you.  No, Ross does.  No.  Ross does fight back?  Ross fights back.  Oh, good.  Good for Ross.  Does he?  Oh, yeah.  Ross gets pissed.  He's like, fuck you.  You're next fucking project.  Oh, good for him.  Ross has a pimple on that one.  Good, good, good.  Well, what TV is she doing?  VH1.  What's the other one?  What was that sound?  I'll find out the other name.  The first stop, I think it's either 10.30 or 11 a.m. is VH1.  Oh, well, it's not while we're on?  Oh, no.  It's after.  Oh, she doesn't want to get up. 
[01:08:30]  So she had plenty of time to come in.  I'm hungover.  I can't get up.  She just doesn't want to get up.  I can't get up this early, guys.  Oh, my God.  Well, she's Tara Reid on Twitter.  She tweets everything, too.  If she had the flu, she would tweet,  Feeling a little sick, everyone?  Feeling sick, guys?  Oh, shit.  She needs all the help she could get.  I mean, this is her biggest vehicle in a long time.  A long time.  And I would imagine she doesn't have a lot of projects after.  It's not a vehicle.  It's a movie, stupid.  Get it? 
[01:09:00]  What does she look like these days?  Not bad.  Not bad.  How can we find out?  She looks through.  Computer?  Shake the mind.  This is the worst computer in the world in this company.  Then why don't you?  Why don't they fix our computers?  They just need new computers.  What's the matter?  Fix it.  Do your duties.  Oh, boy.  Are you talking to the computer or Sam, Edgar?  Sam, why don't you Google it?  There's an ad for American Reunion right on the side of it.  Quiet, Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Edgar. 
[01:09:30]  Sorry, Edgar.  Do you bite people with those dry teeth?  Those dry teeth.  No, I don't.  Sometimes when I kiss, my lips get stuck to someone's cheek.  Ugh.  They're dry.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  I don't like Roland.  Their morning show starts at 10.  At 10.  10 in the morning?  At 11.  What a dumb time to start a morning show.  Yeah, but that's better to do than this show.  That's so stupid.  That's a lot better than satellite radio.  Oh, yeah.  What fucking dummies? 
[01:10:00]  Yes, they are.  Oh, wow.  Is that dumb?  I have developed such a fucking hatred for publicists.  Of course.  Because most of them are absolutely incompetent.  Like, some of them are great at damage control.  Like, when you're working with fucking some of these celebrities, like Alec Baldwin, who's  always got a fucking problem happening, and a publicist has to do that type of fucking  putting out fires, that's where they're valuable.  Yikes.  Something happened.  Fucking lick that pussy.  Oh, God.  Fucking lick that asshole. 
[01:10:30]  That's not bad, eh?  He's doing that like tonight.  No, it's not bad, man.  It goes straight down.  Tara Reid really is a hipless dummy.  Yeah, she stinks.  She has no hips to speak of.  Yeah.  It goes straight down.  Carson's mom would let him marry her.  She's like that Asian kid with the fireworks in Doc Ock's apartment in Boogie Nights.  Carson Daly, right?  Yeah.  His mom said, for the love of God, do not marry her.  Really?  And she tried his mom and broke down crying.  Oh, right.  They were an item.  Who's?  Carson Daly's mom? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Carson Daly and Tara Reid were the little Hollywood couple for a while, huh?  His mom got all fucking...  Mm-hmm.  Why are you fucking telling tales out of school?  He's fucking had it.  He's way more honest today than he's ever been.  Roland doesn't give a turn.  Roland, your friend Carson probably doesn't want that info out that his mommy told him not  to marry fucking Tara.  Yeah, that's mommy shit.  That's mommy stuff.  You don't fucking give mommy information out.  Roland, let me check for the other stuff so I won't get down.  Oh, shit. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, the other stuff is probably good, right?  Oh, yeah.  Gay sex in the dressing rooms?  No, you said it.  Well, you said it.  Oh, wait.  I said it.  Shit.  Roland, you are pissed.  Dilla Gaff.  You are pissed off.  Roland is pissed.  I don't know what's going on.  He's fucking flaky, dumb publicist.  Yeah, we went from having the whole cast of American Reunion to Eugene Levy yesterday.  What happened?  What a voice he has, by the way.  His voice is awesome.  When you listen to him talk, he has an amazing voice.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  On the radio.  Yeah, they want to sleep in the house.  I just heard you guys.  Where's everybody else?  I'm like, ah!  Oh, boy.  And what's his name was good when he came in?  Sean.  Sean, William Scott's great.  He's always good on the show, yeah.  Yeah, he wanted to come in and be excited to a project.  No, he's fine.  He's a friend of the show.  I like Sean William Scott.  He's not a dick.  Fuck Tyree, though.  I don't give a fuck if she comes in or not.  We got Clint Hill today.  He's all I care about today.  Ah, right.  Secret Service guy for Jackie Kennedy.  I don't give a fuck about her.  He's the guy that was on the back of the limo. 
[01:12:30]  In the Zapruder film, Clint Hill was five feet behind when Kennedy got shot.  He jumped on the back hood or whatever.  He jumped on the back hood.  Kept Jackie from sliding off the trunk.  But that's not why.  No, he, yeah.  He, she was reaching out for, because he's like, he talks about that.  He'll talk about it.  But he got, he got Kennedy's brains on him.  Oh, my God.  And missed.  Like, he got Kennedy's fucking blood and brains on him.  And he pushed the brains.  She saved the brains, too.  Well, she got part of it, yeah.  But he said, there's a photo of him riding to Parkland Memorial on the back of the fucking 
[01:13:00]  car, holding on.  And he's covering Jackie.  That was what he did.  I wonder if he ever, at any point during that ride, felt like going, whee!  Probably not.  Ah, all right.  That's a viable question.  He said at one point he was doing 80 miles an hour.  He's afraid he turned and his fucking sunglasses flew off.  Oh, man.  He was worried about flying off the car.  Oh, jeez.  What was he holding on to?  They had, like, these, at one point they had handles on the back, but JFK didn't like  guys on the back of his car. 
[01:13:30]  So there's a photo of him squatting as they came around, I think, before Elm Street, squatting  to be behind Miss Kennedy on the running boards.  And then there was, he held on to, I don't know what he held on to when they were actually  speeding to Parkland Memorial.  Just having his fucking fingertips in the little seam for the truck.  Dude, he said he had every ounce of strength.  Oh, man.  And he said when those guys drove, the fucking follow car was five feet or less behind the  lead car.  Five feet or less at all times.  He just got run over.  Oh, he was a dead man.  And his name wouldn't have even made the news. 
[01:14:00]  He's the most famous of all of them, Clint Hill, for some reason.  I guess because in the Zapruder film, he's that guy who's running and jumping on the  back of that car.  How old a gentleman is he these days?  I'm going to guess in his 80s.  Yeah, he's got to be up there, huh?  He was on the NBC News last night.  Oh, yeah?  He's a fucking...  Is he sharp as a tack or is he...  Oh, yeah.  And when he tells a story, he gets really emotional because he flushes the back.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, he worked for five presidents.  That'd be awkward.  Why emotional?  It's been 50 years.  Get over it.  Because he saved me.  The Secret Service agent with two bad knees. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Right.  He's the one that lifted Kennedy's body out of the car, too.  Well...  Really?  He helped, yeah.  I don't know if he did...  I think he covered his jacket.  Awkward, too.  He put his jacket over JFK because she wouldn't...  She was just holding on to him.  Whoa.  And it's weird when you hear these guys talk because they humanized the assassination, which  was so fucking...  Zapruder film is just the Zapruder film.  Yeah.  It's just this thing we watch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like he makes it like...  He talks about what she said in the car and how she wouldn't let any...  Let go.  And then he realized she didn't want anybody to see her husband's fucking bashed up. 
[01:15:00]  You know, so he put his jacket over and then she...  I hear the publicist says he's not to mention anything about the Kennedy assassination.  He's only talking about his time in Greece after.  Yes.  I read the first chapter.  We only got the book yesterday.  And I was writing for Hannity.  And then I read like the last four, which was the assassination and the epilogue and  post-White House.  Well, yeah, but I want to read the other stuff because I already knew the assassination stuff.  I actually want to read the rest of the book. 
[01:15:30]  But she was apparently an amazing fucking woman, Jackie.  I never appreciated her when she was alive.  She just reminded me of like a rich...  She had grace.  Yeah, but I wish I would have been smarter before she died and kind of appreciated who  she was.  A lot of people said that he was in love with her.  It seems like he was.  She just says not, but a lot of people take that from the book.  There are...  He was married with kids, but there are moments where you're like, it does seem like he was.  And how could you not be?  Yeah.  You have to be enthralled with her on some level because she was one of those people 
[01:16:00]  that when she was in the room with JFK, she fucking almost was outshone him.  She outshone fucking John Kennedy.  Yeah, yeah.  When he would go abroad, everyone used to chant Jackie's name.  Yeah, she was the one.  They loved seeing her.  Yeah.  He introduced himself in Europe or something.  It's, hi, I'm the man who accompanied Mrs. Kennedy.  Yeah.  Ick benina cuckold.  And all she wanted to do was talk about Martin Luther King and fucking...  Oh, God.  Okay. 
[01:16:30]  When's Clint coming in?  Nine o'clock?  Nine o'clock.  Nice.  So, fuck, dumb tower reader.  So, Roland, relax.  It's all good.  Oh, stupid Kim Kardashian.  She's on one of the morning shows.  Today exclusive.  The writer today.  Apparently, she's co-hosting today.  Oh, she is.  Who?  It's going to be captivating.  She's co-hosting the Today Show?  She's doing the Sarah Palin gig.  Oh.  She's what's up.  She's got that fake relationship with Kanye West.  You think it's publicity?  No.  Complete publicity stunt.  That's love.  Y'all are wrong.  Complete publicity stunt. 
[01:17:00]  She's good at publicity stunts.  I'll give her that much.  Or her people are.  Yes, Jimmy.  So stupid people on Twitter.  Someone Twittered Tara Reid.  Got the flu?  Need to clear your senses?  Just take a deep breath and sniff Jim Norton's oniony bean bag.  There's just no reason for that.  What's her name on Twitter?  Tara Reid?  Uh, yes, it's Tara.  I'm just saying. 
[01:17:30]  I'm just saying it's Tara Reid on Twitter.  Relax, Roland.  Say nothing over here.  If she's sick, I would say wish her well.  I hope she feels better.  I hope she feels better.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Roland, you're doing a great job.  Thank you.  I so appreciate it, guys.  Hello, guys.  Hi.  Tara Reid.  I'll do a phoner.  Oh, yeah.  No, we don't want to phone her.  No.  Because she's not even just doing this.  She's actually, she's supposed to be sick today.  And then people are like, well, is she going to make a DC April 12th through the 14th? 
[01:18:00]  And like, people are like, I don't know.  What's going on down there?  I'm confused.  Well, I'm doing the improv that week.  Are you?  And you're hoping she shows up?  A couple of the shows are already sold.  And April 19th through 21st, I'm in Cincinnati at that fucking funny bone.  All right, Roland, why don't you go get some coffee?  Relax.  Everything's good.  I can.  I'm on this diet thing.  I have to.  You look like you lost weight.  What?  Is that why you're so fucking miserable?  Good.  Yeah, I'm about to kill somebody.  That's good, though.  You on Weight Watchers points?  No, no, it's a different one.  That's what I'm doing.  Parents, you lose weight. 
[01:18:30]  You look like you did.  How many pounds?  A few.  And this one's a 90-day program.  A few?  Maybe you'll get up to many or several.  Well, my friend, he lost a-  Mr. Vague.  He was bigger than me.  He lost like 100 pounds on this program.  Oh, good for you.  90 days.  So I started it a week ago.  Even at Bruce, backstage with all these fried foods.  Whoa.  I just grabbed a water.  Always comes back to Bruce.  Did you meet Bruce again last night?  Always comes back.  The other one?  No, he walked by and just like pinned my head.  So that was more than that.  Did you get your fucking picture?  No, not yet. 
[01:19:00]  Not yet.  You're that close to him.  Get your fucking picture.  I have an ice cream.  I'm like, ah!  He touched me.  Then I go, ah, picture.  Did you drink last night?  Water.  Wow.  Yeah, that's why you're miserable.  Yep.  You like fucking drinking.  I love it!  Right now, I'd be having Bailey's and coffee going, hey guys, what's up?  All right, yeah.  She canceled Mazel Tov and leave.  Yeah, who cares?  Mazel Tov.  So no booze, fried food, or sugar, man. 
[01:19:30]  Or pasta.  You're losing your mind.  I'll bet Roland has apnea, though, because you're always tired, and I know how awful  it is for me, and you're heavier, so it's like, it will help you probably sleep better.  Rub it in, Jimmy.  No, but I'm saying it will probably help you breathe better.  Don't diagnose.  No, no.  No, no, I mean, you know, being a fat fuck.  Whatever color being nose is, I wouldn't die it.  Oh, Jesus.  No double F word, please.  Yes, I know.  I wasn't saying that about you.  I was saying Jimmy would be very insulting if he would say that.  I was trying to encourage this heap of shit that he's doing well. 
[01:20:00]  Nothing on that shit.  Trying to encourage Roland.  He's just so mean.  No, it's okay.  It was very mean, and we're scared of Roland.  Why?  I want Roland to be healthy.  You guys always tell Roland he's doing a good job right before you think he's on the  verge of a breakdown.  Oh, yeah.  We're all, uh...  That's the tell.  Like, when they think you're about to break down.  We're all secretly scared of Roland.  The angry panda.  We don't want to be pulled through those bars.  Angry panda.  Oh, man.  And my protein chip is delicious.  Lose your jacket.  Yeah, my jacket is close to the bars.  I don't want him pulling me and the jacket into the cage.  You've got to spin around. 
[01:20:30]  Roland's just playing with your jacket.  You can only watch and poke him with a stick.  Hey, can we do the Mega Millions broad?  That's where we were.  Oh, right.  I want to hear it.  Roland, thanks, buddy.  I hear that bitch.  Fuck Tara Reid.  Love to.  I'm reading your lips today.  I get it.  Fuck her.  Hipless body.  Hip stopped growing at 12 years old on that body.  Where's the bitch's hips?  All right.  Mega Millions broad.  We did the story, but I want to hear the audio of the story because she's a real treat.  You got him.  I got him. 
[01:21:00]  He called it Roland.  That Roland turns around for her.  Exactly.  I almost broke his dumb hip.  Here we go.  All right.  Merlonda Wilson.  Oh, yuck.  Merlonda.  Terrible name that is.  Oh, God.  Don't look like Merlonda Wilson.  Huh?  I had to close the window and go back to it.  Why?  Because this new computer can...  Well, open it up.  Let's let some air in here.  Hey, we got any word on new computers, or are they going to just let that fall by the wayside  like everything else around here?  We need new computers everywhere, but how about you get, you know, one of your bigger shows  some computers. 
[01:21:30]  Start with us.  That would be nice.  ...week since the winning tickets were sold in Maryland, Kansas, and Illinois.  Well, not a single winner has officially claimed their big prize.  In Illinois, the winning store will receive a big fat check today.  Lottery officials in Maryland, though, have a news conference scheduled for this afternoon,  and they've had their doubts about a McDonald's employee who says she won that state's ticket.  She still hasn't forked over that all-important piece of paper.  Even her attorney hasn't seen it.  I cannot say with any certainty that this ticket exists, and I would caution anybody until 
[01:22:00]  it's presented to the lottery commissioner for processing that it does exist.  All right, so let's sort this out.  Joining me this morning is Yvonne Wenger of the Baltimore Sun.  Yvonne, it's good to have you here.  What's going to happen this...  Is this too long?  Yeah.  I like cutting our losses lately.  Yeah, let's cut our losses on you.  It's kind of long, right?  I just want to hear the broad talk.  They're just babbling.  Why wouldn't they just let her talk?  Yeah, exactly.  You know what, though?  If she did win, she will be an interesting fucking one to watch unfold with the money. 
[01:22:30]  She didn't win.  But if she did...  Huh?  It'll take two weeks, and she'll spend it all.  Yeah, that would be kind of fun.  Yeah.  She'll buy one...  She'll buy like a...  She'll have like a 300-story hat built.  You and your hats!  Jimmy's hat obsession.  I don't know why the hats.  It's hats.  You're talking about a lady that lost a ticket, but she hasn't checked her own pants yet.  And you're still hoping that she's the winner, Jimmy?  She's the winner, Jimmy.  There's no fucking way.  Either that, or she just realizes what's about to happen, so she's casting doubt everywhere. 
[01:23:00]  No, she's a lunatic.  She hasn't thought those things out.  I hope you're right, because I want her to be destitute and die of starvation.  I hate her with a vengeance.  Oscar de la Hoya next?  That story made me so fucking happy.  That's why we'll have an Oscar de la Hoya update for everybody next.  Oh.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Cheech.  And this is John.  Hey, this is Chelsea Laylee. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, what's up?  This is Chris Rock.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  This is Paul Mooney.  And you sound like shit.  Oscar de la Hoya scores win.  How happy did this make you?  Excuse me.  An alleged hooker's sex romp suit.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  So great, man.  What happened?  She, I guess, I don't even know what she alleged. 
[01:24:00]  It was something like he forced her to stay.  She's a high-priced escort.  Oh.  It was sweet.  At the plaza, I think it happened.  Right.  And I don't know exactly what the thing was, but she was accusing him of not letting her  leave or some bullshit.  Accused him in a $5 million lawsuit, $5 million she wanted from Oscar, for taking advantage  of her during a drug-fueled sex romp.  I love drug fuel.  Yeah.  It's great.  Drug-fueled.  She's been in gas these days. 
[01:24:30]  Picture a gas pump with just pills coming out of it.  Drug-fueled.  In a devastating one-two punch, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Paul Wooten found Angelica's  tale of being imprisoned by the Olympic gold medalist, frivolous, throwing her suit out  and ordering her to pay a $500 fine.  Get a new suit?  And the boxer's legal fees.  Oh, I get it.  That's a big one?  Because Oscar does not use a fucking $200 an hour lawyer.  What joke did I miss?  What happened? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, nothing, Chip.  It was a good one.  Oh, God.  Something about a suit.  Yeah.  And they had a good one.  What'd he say?  What'd I say?  They said that they threw her suit out, and I said she's going to have to get a new suit.  Not that kind of suit.  That's a stupid joke.  Chip.  It's not funny.  How come you get that?  It's a joke.  He's kidding.  God, Chip.  I would have said suit.  What is she?  Hots, clubs, aces, diamonds, or other things?  Well, that's good, too.  That works.  Whitten found the case was completely without merit in the law, and said the suit was fashioned 
[01:25:30]  simply to harass or maliciously injure the troubled fighter.  Kurt, I had it first, you asshole.  What happened?  What happened?  I have to tell my jokes a minute after I say them.  De La Hoya's lawyer contended her fears were ridiculous.  De La Hoya's lawyer.  Because his client's touching of plaintiff, a prostitute, in the context of a night of 
[01:26:00]  sexual activity, cannot be deemed offensive.  Oh.  So, bravo.  She was just looking for a little fame and a little payday.  Fuck her.  I'm just so happy he won.  I don't know what the merits of her allegations are.  My opinion would be that it would be bullshit, and I'm just so fucking happy that the judge  said pay his legal fees.  Because, you know, Oscar has a fucking big gun lawyer.  Oh, yeah.  The judge realized that De La Hoya never threatened her with force, and he said, the judge here, 
[01:26:30]  he was slapping them with a fine and the legal fees because frivolous and baseless allegations  will not be tolerated by this court.  Great.  We need more of that.  More fuck.  Absolutely do.  More lawyers.  I mean, more judges should do that.  Because then people will be a lot less likely to file these garbage fucking bullshit suits.  Right.  I was just watching Bruce doing something.  Bruce Springsteen.  They showed him at the show, and there was a young fan that he brought up on stage. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know what that's all about.  I'm sure Roland knows.  Do you think Roland would be happy to be brought up on stage and sing along?  Oh, he would love it.  Dancing in the dark.  Even if we're just dancing in the dark.  He does the fucking Courtney Cox dance.  Puts his hand out and brings him up on stage.  Pulls his back.  Can't stop fire without a fire.  It's been higher.  You're dancing in the dark. 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  Talking, I'm dancing.  And no one understands what I say.  I go to bed and I'm having sleep apnea.  You're fucking with the angry panda.  I know.  It's very dangerous.  It's very dangerous.  I'm gasping in the dark.  Because I stop breathing when it's dark.  And it's not a fire. 
[01:28:00]  You can't get a good night's sleep.  And it's not a fire.  That's fire?  Yes.  It's kind of higher.  That's a good one.  We're looking at the Roland photoshops.  Yeah, there's a lot.  You know the picture of Roland, what, front row at the Springsteen show?  So you see Roland's big fucking head and Springsteen in the background.  Well, people are photoshopping.  That's a funny one.  Roland's shirtless.  And Bruce is sexually looking at his shirtless man on stage.  Give us some more.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Is there any other good ones? 
[01:28:30]  Is this on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony?  Roland just loves Bruce.  Roland's standing in Vietnam.  Wow.  What a famous assassination that is.  The Asian guy just shooting the other Vietnamese guy?  Yeah, yeah.  And Roland's just there to have his picture taken.  Roland's just looking at the camera.  You're not paying attention to the murder?  I don't know.  The cold-blooded murder behind him.  He's getting a shot.  Any other good ones?  They have him at the Oswald killing, too.  Oh, they do?  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Okay, there's a stallion fucking Bruce in the ass on stage.  And Roland's just kind of looking.  He has no idea.  It's happening behind him.  He's just looking on.  I see there's one from Ground Zero.  The famous Hulk picture looking around the fucking building.  Now that's Roland.  I see Hitler's driving past Roland.  Yeah.  Giving the Hitler.  Very good.  Oh, very good.  They put a little hat on him.  In the Oswald assassination.  Killing.  That's my favorite right there.  That is a good one. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  Oh, man.  Good old Roland.  There he is.  Roland running away from the Hulk.  The Hulk is coming out from the building.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  The visual element would be great.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  It was very funny.  I did this.  We forgot about that.  Hilarious.  Bullshit, though.  It's not real.  That shit's hilarious.  Jimmy and his pink hoodie on stage with Bruce.  I look good in my pink hoodie.  Oh, Roland is the fucking Hindenburg.  Just taking a photo.  Roland is the Hindenburg.  Hey, is this a visual? 
[01:30:00]  Anthony.  I'm kidding.  Is this a visual element right now?  It is.  It's actually very fun.  Are we doing a visual element?  Yes, we are.  No, we don't have a visual element.  Oh.  For ourselves.  We're just describing it.  Sam's more mad than he's letting on to today.  You're really frustrated with the computers, huh?  They're horrible.  Computer.  I'm just having the same problems at 5 o'clock.  Why would they update the fucking computers?  Why would they?  How hard could it be?  Because I was back in the office before the show having problems with the computer because  everything was slow and then it's a timely thing doing a radio show. 
[01:30:30]  If I was running this company, I would pick a couple shows that desperately need their  computers updated and I would just fucking get them updated.  You don't have to do the whole place.  The ones that are live.  Yeah.  The show's live.  Yeah, he's got a ball gag in his mouth.  Dildo on his head.  Dildo flopped across his head.  That's a good one.  No, that might be Bruce's big cake.  Oh, it's Bruce's cock over his head.  I think it's Bruce's big cake.  Wow, that's amazing.  Well, the computer's working now, so we're good.  And let's not forget about Tim in Afghanistan. 
[01:31:00]  We're bitching.  He's out there.  I'm bitching.  Oh, he's with the village people.  Fighting the good fight.  Yeah, but his computer works.  His computer works.  You're right.  You're rolling the picture on the Justice for Trayvon.  That's very funny.  Trayvon.  That's hilarious.  Roland's picture.  Funny.  Hey, Marion Barry is in trouble again.  Oh, no.  I love it.  We had Marion Barry on our show.  Marion Barry.  Remember?  Yes.  And the publicist was all nervous.  We only got to talk to him for a couple minutes real quickly. 
[01:31:30]  Marion Barry complains of Asian-owned dirty shops after winning D.C. primary.  Former D.C. mayor, Marion Barry is once again attracting the wrong kind  The wrong kind of attention.  The wrong kind.  Never.  When will Marion Barry stop smoking crack?  Never.  Oh, Ira's around today?  Oh.  You want me to go look?  Yeah.  Can we kidnap?  You think we could kidnap Ira?  I've been hoodwinked.  Shanghai. 
[01:32:00]  I see him.  Should I just ask him if he wants to come on the show?  Yeah.  I'll see what he says.  No.  I'm not allowed.  I work for Jay Thomas.  Jay Thomas.  Do you think he gets paid?  A little bit.  Not much.  Why don't we just pay him more?  That's a good idea.  Ah, a bidding war for Ira.  We'll give you more.  I miss Ira on this show.  Who doesn't?  He was great.  I don't understand.  With bright blue skin. 
[01:32:30]  I don't understand why he couldn't come on.  Because Jay Thomas is a twat.  Jay Thomas doesn't want him.  What did Jay say, though?  Did he ever respond, or did he ever say?  No, not really.  I bet he's afraid that he's going to say something or get caught up in some situation in here  that isn't appropriate, and then it would take away from his wholesome kind of family  show.  Jay doesn't have a family show, does he?  I don't know.  I don't know what he does.  I've done it.  But Jay doesn't know how to handle Ira the right way. 
[01:33:00]  Ira's not as exciting on Jay's show as he was on ours.  I'm a bundle of energy.  Let's see.  Wrong kind of attention.  Marion Barry, after he used his election night victory speech to go off to Asian-owned  stores.  What's this about, Ann?  He said, we've got to do something about these Asians coming in, opening up businesses,  those dirty shops.  Can you imagine if a fucking white politician said that?  Oh, my God.  It's in the news, I'm sure, but it's not. 
[01:33:30]  I haven't seen it this morning.  There's no big outrage.  No.  Barry went on to say they ought to go.  I'll just say that right now, you know.  Wow.  But we need African-American business people to be able to take their places, too.  Well, that's always been the sticky wicket, hasn't it?  So what's the problem with this?  Black-owned businesses in black communities.  Why can't that happen?  Well, there's always been that head-butting between the black community and the Asian shop  owners that come in and open up stores. 
[01:34:00]  And what they say, the blacks say, take the money out of their community.  Right.  And don't put it back in.  Well, how about this?  How about in black neighborhoods?  You just don't go to those stores.  You don't support them.  Well, because then there would be nowhere to really shop.  Yeah.  But instead of blaming it on the Asians, how about, you know, pull some resources, do some  planning, open up some businesses, and frequent those businesses.  There you go. 
[01:34:30]  There you go.  Don't knock the Asians for coming into communities that are, a lot of times, very dangerous for  them to work in and supplying a service.  You know, I'm sure they don't like you as much as you don't like them.  Just watch Menace.  Part of the problem is what Patrice talked about, too, which was Asian customer service  is usually very bad.  And I do attribute that to the fact that there are so many Asian people, they just get used  to, whatever, all right, next, next.  You think that's what it is? 
[01:35:00]  I do.  As simple as that?  I just think it's a cultural thing.  Yeah.  And I've had problems at our supermarket, which is run by Asian people, and I'm astounded by  the lack of giving a fuck when I have, like, a legit complaint about terrible service.  Like, I'll order food, and two hours later, it's not there.  And, like, oh, we were, whatever, or they sent me the wrong order.  But that's got to be in their DNA.  No, it's just a cultural thing.  You think it's just a cultural thing, huh?  They'll send me, like, I order something, and it's wrong, so I call back. 
[01:35:30]  And then they'll resend it, pick up their item, and then charge me the extra $1.11 for  the new item.  It's like, you fucking took two hours and sent the wrong stuff?  Ugh.  And then I call the manager.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Give you a smile?  No, they're terrible.  The head will occasionally, but their customer service is not good.  Patrice said it.  Never once do you get in a Chinese restaurant, like, hey, you're here every day.  Here's an egg roll.  Never.  About five, ten minutes.  So they're kind of abrasive in that way.  Okay.  So what will happen is...  That Mr. Cohen, he live on Parker Avenue. 
[01:36:00]  In these neighborhoods.  Cartwright.  Cartwright.  Seinfeld.  I say Cartwright.  She said curse word.  Hang up.  Black people don't feel any connection, I think, to the Asians.  Or maybe vice versa.  I've never felt a connection to an Asian.  I think they're great citizens.  I just haven't.  Wow.  No, I have.  But you say on regular radio, you get in trouble.  Tia Carrera?  No, I've never felt a connection to an Asian in my entire life.  I just think...  I think only good customer service-wise is lacking.  They're very robotic. 
[01:36:30]  Tia Carrera?  True lies?  No?  Well, yeah.  Tia Carrera?  I think she was half Asian.  Yeah, that's true.  How about Yoshi?  She was beautiful.  Yoshi?  Yoshi?  All right.  So you've had...  I haven't had a connection.  Yeah.  Gary Nakamura?  Who's he?  He was a friend of mine back in the 80s.  What ever happened to him?  Wait, a real friend?  That was Gary Nakamura.  Yeah, he actually showed me a Sony Walkman before they were here, because he used to go  to Japan, and he brought one back with him, and he's like, you've got to check this out. 
[01:37:00]  What year was this?  I know.  I just realized what I did there.  This was early 80s.  I mean, how old did a Walkman come to say?  I don't remember.  Yeah, it was pretty much right before they came over here.  Didn't our old boss fucking invent it or something?  I don't know.  Didn't he have something to do with that crap?  He showed me this thing, and he's like...  And all they really had back then was you put headphones on with your stereo system at home, 
[01:37:30]  or you had a transistor radio with the one little earpiece.  Right, right.  That was pretty much all you had for headphone-related audio.  So why couldn't we figure that out?  I don't know, but they figured out a way...  If you remember, the Walkman revolutionized having good sound portable with you.  So I put this thing on and turned it on and was like, holy fuck, it sounds like a stereo.  You're in a room with a fucking full-size stereo.  But we love talking about our ancestors and how they didn't figure shit out properly.  It took forever. 
[01:38:00]  So yeah, you're saying transistor radio with the one fucking earbud.  A little earplug to listen to the game.  Figure out that a towering high fly ball deep into center field, easily picked off the aliening.  That's how everything sounded back then.  But no one could figure out to make a second one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obviously, the audio quality would have still sucked,  but to hear it in both ears would have enhanced the experience a bit, right?  Yes.  But yeah, I guess it was...  It didn't matter at that point.  It was all fucking...  Staticky. 
[01:38:30]  Well, the thinking was that if you had both ears with sound coming...  One ear, at least you could keep aware of what's going on around you.  Ah, that's true.  That was very important back then.  You had to know if an air raid was coming from the Soviets.  But if it had two ears, they were afraid that the sound would come unevenly,  and one would come like a microsecond before and destroy the brain.  I made this whole thing up.  I know.  I know.  I just knew.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I just knew, too.  You're actually getting better.  I just knew.  He really is getting a lot better at his acting. 
[01:39:00]  Because I almost bought that one.  What was it?  The Discman?  The Discman was the...  Yeah.  With the CDs.  With the CDs.  When I was a big-time runner, I had that Discman.  Oh.  That shit would skip all over the fucking place.  Oh, right, right.  It would drive you nuts.  They used to skip.  That's right.  Oh, God.  They couldn't figure out that buffering.  They didn't have enough memory to buffer the audio.  Nope.  So it wouldn't skip that band.  Do you remember how fucking advanced those things seemed?  Oh, amazing. 
[01:39:30]  Look, it's a disc you take with you.  It's crazy.  Oh, it was great for the time.  It's just lunacy.  Like, digital just wiped out everything.  Oh, that's true.  Everything's digitally delivered now.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know what to make of it.  Oh, what do I know?  You go futzing around up in the sky, and the next thing you know, there's all kinds of music in your flower bed.  Don't tell me nothing, honey.  I still appreciate a good record.  Bing or Inglebert Humperdinck.  I don't know what this digital delivery is.  I still get my mail from the mailman. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, that's why they call it the mailman.  What happens is your cat jumps up and hits the record.  I'm like, Scooter, get off of there.  You're making the record skip.  Quit meowing all over the place.  I don't go for the digital.  What if it misses?  What if I go to download it and I move my iPad?  What if I do that?  What if it hits me right in my head or it goes in my hat?  I can't listen to songs in my hat.  Oh, God.  Oh, I don't know what's going on. 
[01:40:30]  Only one ear because stereo wasn't invented yet.  Yes.  Yeah, they didn't have stereo on those things.  But why can't you just have whatever was in the left ear?  Mono in both ears.  Why not?  Right.  Why not?  I had mono in both ears once.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Oh, I had to go to the doctor.  Chlamydia in my nose.  And then I had who?  Jimmy's just looking at me.  Well, we got a man who accidentally shoots himself in heart with a nail gun. 
[01:41:00]  Whoa, get the fuck out of here.  That's pretty cool.  Why are nail guns ill?  You're going to be okay.  Shouldn't you have to get a permit for a nail gun?  I would think.  That shit is dangerous.  Well, they have pneumatic nail guns that work off the compressor.  Then they have the ones that are powder actuated, which you actually use a shell, like a .22 caliber or a .38 caliber shell bullet shell without the lead in it.  You put it in, and that goes and just fires the nail into concrete and shit. 
[01:41:30]  Fuck.  It's pretty fucked up.  And they usually have a safety on them where it has to be pressed pretty hard against a flat or a stiff, rigid surface to go off.  That's like the safety.  So when you see in the movies them just holding it and pulling the trigger, you can't do that.  You have to push the mount down.  Well, you can push the safety down in between your fingers and let the nails fly.  We used to do that.  Really?  Yeah, between your fingers.  How cool is that? 
[01:42:00]  Shooting rats in the basements.  How far do they shoot?  Uh, the powder actuated ones are crazy.  They'll shoot fucking far.  How far are they?  The pneumatic ones, that'll shoot, um...  It used to go down about three properties of houses in the apartment complexes we used to build.  Damn.  So, yeah.  Damn.  It was pretty fucking far.  And the pneumatic ones, not as far, but those are just made for wood, pretty much.  How humiliating is it?  You just did fucking five minutes on nail guns. 
[01:42:30]  Nail guns!  I love a good nail gun.  But I know nothing about...  Here's how it's going with nail guns.  Yeah, man, don't get those shot at you.  But you made it...  It's awe-inspiring that you can be funny with nail guns and make the fucking sound and know  the difference.  I know nothing about them.  I'd have to get a hooker in there quick.  I mean, I was on many job sites back in the day.  Yeah, and no shit, but this one, I mean, that's something he fucking knows way...  But still, it's just...  Way too close.  Dave, what's up? 
[01:43:00]  Yo, how are you doing this morning?  Good, good.  How are you?  Doing good, man.  I've been listening for a long time.  I just wanted to say, it's always good to use the expression that our ancestors didn't  figure shit out.  But like, I don't know, I feel like every time when I watch the History Channel, I watch  some shit about that old-time shit.  My mind's always blown, because I'm like, oh, how the fuck did they figure that out?  Well... </pre>
