<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a disastrous technical meltdown.  The opening song ("He's Going the Distance") was followed by a lengthy period of microphone malfunctions, primarily affecting Anthony's mic.  The hosts unleashed a torrent of profanity, blaming both the equipment and their seemingly unresponsive management for the ongoing issues, citing broken mics, a faulty phone mouse, and delays in receiving promotional "WOW" stickers.  A call from a technician, "Butch," did little to alleviate the situation, with the hosts and listeners alike disagreeing with Butch’s assessment that the sound was fine.  This segment was filled with continuous complaints about the show's inadequate infrastructure, its premium XM channel status with minimal advertising, and their overall dissatisfaction with management.

After resolving (or at least temporarily mitigating) the technical problems, the hosts shifted to discussing the Boston Red Sox's World Series performance, confidently predicting their victory and mocking bandwagon fans.  The show then featured a series of listener calls.  One caller, "Bill," delivered a rambling, bizarre story involving being hit by a car, only to reveal his location as Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean, then later, the planet Jupiter. Another caller recounted a graphic and vulgar tale about a massage parlor experience.  Additional calls centered on the "WOW" sticker campaign, further complaints about management, and listener concerns regarding show scheduling.  The segment concluded with a caller reporting a robbery at one of the "WOW" sticker distribution points.  The entire broadcast remained punctuated with profanity and sexually explicit content.

The next segment opened with a discussion of broadcast schedules and replays. A caller, Norton, recounted a prison-themed bit, prompting Opie to discuss his nasal congestion. Another caller, D.C., revealed the show's inclusion in a Public Relations textbook, referencing the infamous "Sex for Sam" incident and its analysis within the text.  Ken, another caller, shared an anecdote about a confrontation with his wife and another man at a mall, leading to crude jokes from the hosts, including sexually suggestive remarks about a woman in a wheelchair.  Opie and Anthony then revealed they were both wearing identical shirts, leading to embarrassment and discussion about their upcoming appearance with John McEnroe and his film crew.  The conversation veered into jokes about David Ortiz and his wife.  Anthony then recounted a frustrating parking experience in New York City, involving an encounter with a crackhead and Opie banging on his car window.  A sexually suggestive Klee Motors commercial aired, followed by more bizarre and offensive listener calls.  The upcoming appearance of Steve-O was announced, with a recap of his past stunts on the show, including a cue ball incident.  The hosts discussed their less-than-ideal experience at an XM Satellite Radio press conference, noting encounters with homeless people and complaining about a poorly installed XM radio unit.  They critiqued an Elton John commercial for XM's MiFi device, with Opie making comments about his tolerance of gay people.  The hosts focused on attractive waitresses who distracted the audience at the press conference and mentioned an upcoming video shoot for New York One.  Further listener calls followed, including discussions about LARPing and sexual encounters at LARP conventions.  The arrival and subsequent sleeping of Steve-O were noted, along with more offensive jokes before the segment ended. Throughout, Anthony played Grand Theft Auto, narrating his violent in-game actions.


The next segment featured Steve-O as a guest. It began with the hosts' continued Grand Theft Auto gameplay, noting the game's potentially racially insensitive aspects. Steve-O arrived late, having just flown in from Los Angeles.  The conversation covered his numerous tattoos (including "shit," "fuck," and a "leaky penis"), his negative HIV test results, and a substantial life insurance policy.  He discussed his new girlfriend, Victoria's Secret model Mae Anderson, urging listeners to Google her.  The hosts and Steve-O engaged in banter about his wild lifestyle and past stunts, including his *Jackass* and *Wild Boys* experiences.  Steve-O recounted various arrests, including swallowing a drug-filled condom in Sweden and stapling his scrotum to his thigh (deemed "an act of art" by a Louisiana court).  He also mentioned a near-death experience filming a commercial involving lions.  He promoted his new DVD, "Steve-O: The Early Years," and the conversation continued with discussions of his reckless behavior, drug use, and a recent arrest of his friend Chris.  The hosts also discussed the upcoming "Lesbian for a Day" segment and John Valby's appearance.  The segment concluded with the hosts returning to Grand Theft Auto, with Anthony engaging in increasingly violent and offensive in-game actions.


The following segment with Steve-O began with a humorous anecdote about having sex with a woman while she was simultaneously on the phone with her boyfriend. This transitioned into a story about Steve-O's arrest on a plane for repeatedly lighting cigarettes, culminating in him extinguishing one on his wrist.  Further conversation involved his *Jackass* filming experiences in India and Indonesia, noting the harsh penalties for drug use there. He then performed a stunt involving duct taping his genitals, which was filmed for their website.  The show then shifted to a discussion comparing dating white and black women, using highly offensive and sexually explicit language.  This was followed by a segment mocking Tony Danza's talk show, highlighting his requests for audience applause. Clips of Danza's show were played, showcasing his banal statements met with enthusiastic applause.  The hosts and a caller critiqued Danza's performance and the audience's reaction.  A caller suggested a return to racier topics, leading to discussions about a midget sighting and past interactions with a midget stripper on the show.  The hosts also discussed John Valby's upcoming appearance and the "Lesbian for a Day" segment. A brief listener call and a chat with comedian Johnny Mack concluded the segment.


A phone interview with John McEnroe followed. McEnroe discussed his past marriage to Tatum O'Neal, their divorce, and his relationship with Patti Smythe. He expressed some regret about not recognizing earlier problems in his marriage to O'Neal but viewed the divorce positively.  The discussion shifted to O'Neal's book and the unreliability of childhood memories, particularly concerning allegations of abuse by her father, Ryan O'Neal.  The hosts and McEnroe discussed Ryan O'Neal's reputation for being difficult and violent.  McEnroe’s recent attendance at a Metallica concert with excessive pyrotechnics was discussed, drawing parallels to the Great White fire tragedy.  A critique of Tony Danza's talk show followed, with McEnroe offering a lukewarm defense of Danza's likability.  A significant portion focused on Opie and Anthony's attempts to book a segment on McEnroe's show.  McEnroe's producers rejected numerous outrageous bit suggestions, including a "wiffle ball bat challenge" involving spanking, rubber gloves, and lubricant.  Alternative ideas, like hitting golf or tennis balls at the hosts (possibly while wearing Tatum O'Neal masks), were discussed but deemed impractical.  McEnroe discussed his own temper on the tennis court, comparing it to outbursts in other sports and suggesting tennis needed more expressive play. He noted his intensity lessened after having children.  He concluded by mentioning encounters with Ozzy Osbourne and other musicians.  The broadcast ended with a brief, unrelated customer service call.

[00:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:13:30]  It's sex.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello. 
[00:14:00]  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Anthony.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Is that even up or anything?  Yeah, that mic works.  Does it?  It's professional broadcasting at its best.  Professional broadcasting at its best.  I can't hear myself as well as I hear everyone else.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, your mic sounds all kind of, I don't know, muffly.  Crap.  Yeah, it sounds awful, actually.  Yeah, doesn't it sound awful?  I don't even hear.  I can hear you, but I...  It's kind of not on or something. 
[00:14:30]  Ah, a little technical glitches.  A little bit.  It's the glitches that'll get you.  Yeah, that's horrible.  This is great.  What happened to my microphone?  It was working yesterday.  And it's...  You hear it.  You hear like a buzz?  Yeah.  In the background.  You hear like a buzz?  You'd think it would be as simple as me moving to that mic, Ben.  But it's really not, because that will throw me so far off being over there.  I'm hidden behind screens. 
[00:15:00]  I can't...  Yeah, listen to that buzz.  Is that coming from this crappy mic?  This is beyond frustrating at this point.  Everyone is expecting me to yell and scream.  It's just not even worth it.  It's just not worth it.  Turn this mic down a second.  It's not worth it.  Every freaking day, there's some stupid little problem with this place.  See if that buzz is coming from this.  And then we yell and scream, and then the people in Washington take it personally.  Well, look.  We're trying to do a radio show here today.  Listen to this.  Is that this mic?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  No, it's all the mics.  Wait. 
[00:15:30]  No, I turned that off.  Oh, what was it?  That one.  Is that my mic?  No, it's your old mic.  My old mic.  Now, how does that sound?  That's what I mean.  That was the old mic?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I got to be cranked up a little more.  No, it's over there.  Yeah, over there.  That's getting better.  Well, try your old mic again.  The old mic?  Yeah, because there's some kind of feedback coming off that.  Hello?  Hello?  No, the old mic's dead.  All right.  The old mic's dead.  The old mic's dead.  This one, but just a little more, I think. 
[00:16:00]  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got to be like, yeah, that's better.  There you go.  At least now it sounds like I usually get down in my headphones.  Not too distracting to start a radio show.  There we go.  Hey, guys.  How's everything?  What bucket does that go into?  This is the bucket.  The shit bucket.  The bucket of stuff that doesn't quite work.  Oh, boy.  The bucket of shit.  Hello?  It's all cute to have these corporate meetings and rah-rah speeches, but you know what?  Let's get the basics done.  We don't even have the basics done yet. 
[00:16:30]  The basics?  I kind of like this one.  They're trying to move our show on to the next level, but, you know, we still don't have...  Oh, fuck.  What?  It's just ridiculous.  It's just...  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  You know?  It is.  It really is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Mm-hmm.  This is so frustrating, you know?  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  You hired Opie and Anthony, not two scumbag radio DJs from a tiny little market. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, well, the scumbag DJ part.  Not from a little market, though.  You know, get our office done.  Make sure the studio's working every single day.  I know they moved some equipment around, so now things don't work because they did that?  Yes, that's exactly what happened.  And then you got, you know, the boss giving rah-rah speeches, but nothing's getting done.  There's just nothing getting done.  You know, then they take our production studio away for a week.  We don't have an office.  Now the mic doesn't work today, and they get mad when we yell and scream about these problems. 
[00:17:30]  You know?  You hired two motherfuckers that want to kick some serious ass in the radio world and just  take everyone down, but you guys are working against us at this point.  You're just working against us.  You know?  Finally, the WOW stickers.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday, I guess.  Oh, it is.  Finally, they're going out in the mail today.  We asked for that three weeks ago, you know?  But you bring up this stuff on the air and everyone gets all sensitive down in Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking bad.  We want to start, you know, kicking ass now.  We don't want to start kicking ass in 2005. 
[00:18:00]  We don't want to start kicking ass in 2006 when Howard goes to the little doggy, you know,  company.  We want to start now.  So, enough with your stupid rah-rah speeches.  If you're not going to get the basics done for us around here, which is an office, which  is a studio that works, which is getting our WOW stickers out so we can start a guerrilla  marketing campaign.  And also, start figuring out how to get us off this stupid premium channel.  We're hidden from everybody. 
[00:18:30]  And if you have to keep us on the premium channel, figure out another way to expose us  to the rest of the XM platform.  It's really starting to get ridiculous.  That was in the bucket of things that we can't do anything about.  No, we could do, we could figure out a lot of things if we have, you know, brains in  this organization that know how to think in radio terms.  I don't think that's a bad way to promote the show, though, to put you on a premium channel  and then not advertise you.  I mean, that goes hand in hand with having people find the show. 
[00:19:00]  You know?  Make it a little more difficult.  Yeah, I mean.  That's all you need to do.  People flip through, they hear a show.  No one ever listens to a radio show that way.  Nah.  We are so hidden on this platform right now.  You know?  I understand the reason we're on a premium channel.  People are signing up like crazy.  But you know what?  We want more people to sign up.  You know?  We're not going to be satisfied until we're talking to over a million people.  We're not there yet, okay?  And then on top of it, we don't even have a studio that works every day. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, every, not every day, because they're working hard around here.  But there's a lot of freaking problems.  Yeah, well, that's what happens, you know?  They're pulling wires, and they're cutting holes in the console to put stuff in.  Oh, I didn't see it.  And maybe somebody cut a wire.  Inadvertently cut a microphone wire.  Who knows?  And this guy, Butch, is saying the mics sound fine on the air.  What does that mean?  Well, now we got a microphone for Anthony, but he didn't have a microphone that worked. 
[00:20:00]  Just remember, it's got to stay, like, cranked up that loud.  All right.  Once I fade away.  You know what?  You know what?  What?  You can't take a phone call?  Let's just go home.  No, we can't take a phone call.  Well, I want to take it this way.  Nice.  Butch.  You guys sound fine, man.  There's no bars.  The mic sounds good.  You're quick.  Well, now it does.  When did you tune in? 
[00:20:30]  At 6.10?  No, I was up at 6.  I was up at the top of the hour.  You sound fine.  Did you hear Anthony from the top of the show?  No, I didn't hear it from the top of the show.  Okay, so it wasn't fine.  It wasn't fine.  Now it's fine, but now we're a little irritated because of the whole thing.  Well, what do you want?  They're Washington, man.  They're not the number one market.  They don't know what the hell they're doing.  All right, Butch.  Thank you.  Can the callers hear me on the air, Opie?  Can you hear Butch?  Butch, can you hear Anthony?  Tell him to say something.  Hello, Butch.  Can you hear me?  No, he's really muffled now. 
[00:21:00]  How about now?  How about now?  That was good.  Ah, there we go.  All right.  That was good.  Use me as your bitch.  Go ahead, first thing in the morning.  That's good.  We used the first half hour of the show to just sort things out.  Thank you, Butch.  All right, guys.  All right.  Good luck.  All right.  Thank you, mister.  I'd like to hang up on you, but now the mouse isn't working on the screen.  You know, and we've been bitching.  Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, oh, you almost threw it.  Butch, watch it.  You know what, Butch?  It's the Opie Anthony, Jim Norton, and Butch Show, because I can't hang up on you, so you 
[00:21:30]  might as well just stay there and whatever you want to fucking say, go ahead and say  it.  I've been bitching about this mouse.  This mouse doesn't work.  You're not supposed to answer phones with a fucking mouse.  Holy shit.  Since you were talking about this, you know, you guys are being advertised on radio Disney  on XM.  Well, that's smart.  That's good advertising.  We want the kids on board.  Because kids should be listening to the Opie Anthony show.  It's stupid things like that that just drive me nuts.  We need radio people to think in radio terms.  Why would Opie Anthony be advertised on the Disney channel? 
[00:22:00]  Put Opie Anthony stand-ups in every Best Buy in the tri-state area.  You guys will kick ass.  No, no, no, because that would actually be promoting the show, and that would be silly.  All right, look.  Look.  We've said it a lot.  This mouse doesn't work all the time.  Okay, look.  It's not working.  If I slam it, it doesn't work anymore.  Oh, now it's gone.  New mouse needed.  Now it's dead.  We've been talking about the stupid phones and the mouse. 
[00:22:30]  I hope you don't treat the mouse in your house like that, Opie.  The mouse doesn't work to answer the phone.  Sometimes it works, and if you slam it, if you listen to the show day to day, you'll hear the...  That's me slamming the mouse to try to make it work so I can hang up.  No.  The mouse has just been put in the bucket of things that have been thrown and broken.  There's a new bucket.  A brand new bucket.  I don't think that's ever going to work again.  No, that mouse...  Well, it wasn't working anyway.  I think you should have thrown it yesterday, but... 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God.  How you feeling, Butch?  I'm pretty good.  How are you, Jim?  Cool.  Good.  Better now that you're here.  No.  Nothing, huh?  No, which...  We don't know how to hang up.  I'm glad you're a fine fellow.  We'll hang up this way.  Thanks, Butch.  Bye, Butch.  Bye, guys.  All right, well...  I gotta go take a chill pill.  I'm fucking believable, man. 
[00:23:30]  Thanks, man.  Bill, get it working again.  You know, before...  We'll have fun.  Before you give us speeches about trying to take the show to the next level, why don't you  just, you know, take care of your end of the bargain?  Mm-hmm.  And believe me, we'll take care of our end of the bargain, like you wouldn't believe...  People are calling up and saying, sounds fine.  No, it's not the sound.  We can't answer the phone.  The phone thing is broken.  There has to be a certain float of things. 
[00:24:00]  When you want to pick up the phone, you have to be able to pick up the phone.  And doing a radio show is all about rhythm, so when you get in here and, you know, you  want to get right into it, you don't want to worry about microphones not working or a  mouse that's supposed to answer phones that is not working right.  Right.  All right, well, here's a little track from a CD we weren't allowed to put out.  As we try to fix things.  Yeah, we'll try to start the show the real way in a few minutes here, but here's, they  call my name's Bill, Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  All-time association, may I help you?  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number? 
[00:25:00]  I believe it's an 8.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  I'm wet.  Do you know?  I believe I need a changing.  Stay on the phone. 
[00:25:30]  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay, well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a changing and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't 
[00:26:00]  talk to you.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a call, Sam.  He said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now. 
[00:26:30]  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  Well, he's doing good.  He's still here.  He did.  He probably will sit by the night.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down and walked.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Somebody call an ambulance.  I told you.  Now, this is horrible.  My God, he looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  The man got hit.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man's got a hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late.  It's too late. 
[00:27:30]  There's bad spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late unless you got a shovel.  All right.  We'll get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  You can't help anymore.  Just bring a shovel.  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho. 
[00:28:00]  A pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter. 
[00:28:30]  23.  Okay.  Do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab, but just tell me where to send it.  Just tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter.  28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[00:29:00]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing  down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly. 
[00:29:30]  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony.  Houston, one of my favorite towns with the hottest fucking strippers on the face of the  planet, and only about 2,000 strip clubs.  What the fuck are you guys doing here?  You got more strip clubs than gas stations.  That's how they give you directions.  Yeah, you take a right at the men's club, go down to Rick's, take a left.  That's how you get around.  But you got, like, happy strippers.  They're, like, nice.  In L.A., they're all, like, out-of-work actresses, and they're fucking mean.  They're, like, evil bitches that fucked up on their Baywatch audition. 
[00:30:00]  They're, like, mad at you.  Yeah, because no one in L.A. is just, like, living.  They're all, like, doing something.  They're not, like, hanging out.  You know, they're not just having a good time living life.  It's always the career.  I gotta have a career.  They're, like, freaks with big holes in their soul that need to fill up with other people's  attention.  Not me.  I'm different.  That's why I'm up here.  But...  They're fucking brutal.  Like, you can't go to, like, strip clubs in L.A.  Like, you can't talk to them.  Because they won't talk.  They're mad.  They're mean.  Like, every guy knows after you've been to a strip club for, like, what, ten minutes? 
[00:30:30]  The fact they're all naked gets a little boring, right?  You want to talk to them and ask them, like, creepy questions and shit.  Right?  It's not just me, right?  You know what I'm talking about?  I swear to God, this is happening.  I was...  Ha, ha, ha.  I was in L.A.  And this...  One of my friends and this girl's dancing.  And I go to her, I go, hey, is this fun for you?  Do you like doing this?  She goes, I don't talk to you guys who come here.  I'm like, oh, it's a big deal.  I'm just talking to you.  Like, what's up?  She goes, well, most of the guys who come here, they're fucking creeps, okay? 
[00:31:00]  So I have a policy.  I'm like, oh, well, you know what?  I mean, it's an open door.  I mean, nice people can come in, too.  I mean, maybe you shouldn't generalize, you know?  I'm like, wait, you know what?  Most of the guys who come here, they're like, come here for one reason.  I mean, pfft, why did you come here?  I'm like, um, somebody told me there was a place that I could go where I could see a  strange girl's pussy for a dollar.  Like, I'm the one who's fucked up. 
[00:31:30]  You know, I'm like, hello, I'm just a patron, all right?  Just because I'm looking deep into your birth canal for 20 nickels, it doesn't mean I'm fucked up.  I mean, you should have paid more attention in high school, and I have a dollar, okay?  I got four quarters, and you have a bad job. 
[00:32:00]  Don't fuck with me, because you didn't learn how to type.  You know, backup plan, having pain in the ass.  Think you gotta move out here and be special?  I'm gonna show them.  I'm different from every other girl with a toe ring.  Fucking brutal.  Strip clubs are so funny, because it's always women who, like, don't like their bodies,  that get pissed at you, you know?  If you go to this place, you just want to watch those women degrade themselves.  That's why you go there.  You're a misogynist.  That's just how it manifests itself. 
[00:32:30]  You don't even understand that.  I'm like, look, I want to watch everyone I don't know degrade themselves, all right?  It has nothing to do with men or women.  I like fucking freaks.  If I don't know you, I want to watch you fuck up.  It's human nature.  I'm curious, and I like to be amused.  It has nothing to do with hating anybody.  If I'm walking down the street and there's a sign that says,  Dudes Blowing Donkeys, I'm going in once, all right?  It doesn't mean I hate. 
[00:33:00]  I got nothing against dudes, and I got nothing against donkeys.  But if I could pay a reasonable amount of money to watch a guy suck an animal's cock,  I'm gonna go.  Fuck it.  I'm not gonna live forever.  And I want to be some old man walking around going,  I wonder what the look on the donkey's face was.  Was he confused?  Did he enjoy himself?  God damn it.  Why didn't I go?  Maybe he is later.  Not a donkey show to be found. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Please.  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Lockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  Wow me.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The great and powerful Jaime has come in and fixed everything, Opie. 
[00:34:00]  Yes, he has.  The great and powerful Jaime.  You got a microphone working?  Yes, I do.  It makes your voice a little deeper, but we'll go with it.  Does it really?  Yes, it does.  It makes it a little deeper.  All right.  How we doing, everybody?  You ready to rock?  All right, let's move on, all right?  Yes, let's.  Volk trying to end game three. 
[00:34:30]  And he does on the inside corner.  Red Sox up three games to none.  And the Red Sox can shake hands in the middle of this diamond at Bush Stadium after a four-to-one  victory to go up three games to none.  Seven straight wins by the Red Sox.  Remarkable.  It's over, Johnny.  It is remarkable, and you've remarked on it.  You dolt.  Face the facts.  Red Sox are winning the World Series this year. 
[00:35:00]  I've got to say, there is absolutely no way they can lose.  They're going to win the World Series.  They might as well start celebrating now, because it's over.  They've won three straight in the World Series, and I can't even think of anything in recent  history where a team has come back after winning the first three.  Impossible.  Yeah, you know, they've got it in the bag.  It's over.  The Red Sox win.  The Red Sox win. 
[00:35:30]  The Red Sox win.  It's pretty much done.  It's a done deal.  They're a locomotive, Ben, just trouncing the competition.  It's done.  I don't understand why the people in Boston aren't already celebrating.  Why aren't they killing young college girls in Boston?  Oh, wait.  They have already.  Okay.  They just seem to be a little nervous still.  I don't understand it.  You've got this thing won.  Start acting like the Boston Red Sox are the champs. 
[00:36:00]  No.  I don't understand.  No.  They've won three.  Do you think it's an actual possibility that something can go awry and they might lose?  Yeah, I'm not saying anything.  No.  They cannot lose.  The night they beat the Yankees in the final game, I waited until the last out.  I didn't say a thing.  There were all kinds of other Boston fans around me.  I didn't say a thing.  No.  Yeah, but that was, you know, there could have been some wacky thing that happened.  It was only one game, you know.  Either team won a game and it was over. 
[00:36:30]  This one, they got three games on them.  They can't possibly lose.  The cards stink.  They really do.  It's just over.  Game four tonight on Channel 140 on Satellite Radio.  There you go.  A little cross-promoting because that's what they want us to do.  There's your cross-promoting for today.  Very good.  I have not seen a stadium more full of white people since Fenway.  Since Madison Square Garden when the Knicks play?  Jesus.  Amazing.  That's St. Louis, huh? 
[00:37:00]  What do they charge for a house down there?  That seems like a good place to move.  Why?  I don't know.  It just seemed nice and peaceful down there.  Everyone getting along.  They play the little Budweiser theme at the beginning of the game.  And everyone's dancing around and having a good old time.  I think they pour their Budweiser on their cereal in the morning.  I think they do.  They really enjoy their Budweiser beer down there.  And they're just all dancing around and having a jolly good white time with themselves down there. 
[00:37:30]  Right?  They're so happy they have no idea they're losing the World Series.  Oh, I know.  They have no idea.  They're still happy.  They're still happy.  They still got a shot, they think.  They think, ah, we still got a shot at it by gum.  And even if we do lose, we can look to our neighbor on the left, our neighbor on the right, and they're both, well, you know.  They're not golfers.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Boston.  Who knew? 
[00:38:00]  Come on, Jimmy.  We've got to get the energy back in the show.  What's going on today?  All right, guys.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, yo.  You just said that it's pretty much impossible for the Sox to lose.  I'm saying it's absolutely impossible for the Red Sox to lose this.  They've already won the World Series.  I mean, I think Boston should be celebrating right now.  Because there's no way they can lose this.  No way.  But weren't the Yankees up three games on the Sox, and they still lost?  Wow, was that three games they were up? 
[00:38:30]  Yes, they were.  Wow, I hadn't noticed.  The fact that somebody called in and actually mentioned that almost makes me physically ill.  Doesn't it?  It's in the bag for Boston.  It's over.  I got my B hat on and everything.  I'm ready to rock.  I'm a huge Boston fan now.  I see that you have jumped on the bandwagon there, Anthony.  Bandwagon?  I have been a Sox fan for years, Opie.  For years.  Just like everyone else that I see on the street, that every other person you pass is wearing  a goddamn B's hat. 
[00:39:00]  How many Boston Red Sox hats are there in New York all of a sudden?  I was last night, I counted six in a 15-block walk.  Dude, they walked.  It's still got the tag hanging off the back.  I want to punch these people in the face.  The bandwagon jumpers.  Everyone's a Sox fan now.  They're all going to say they were there from the beginning.  They were there since 1918, waiting and waiting for this victory.  Now they're all, they wear brand new hats.  The bill isn't even bent.  And they're walking around like they've been a Sox fan for years. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, go Sox.  They're finally over their shame.  It's almost like if they legalized child molesting, how many people you'd see like, wow, I didn't  realize you like kids.  Sure.  That's the way they were always closet awful Red Sox fans.  They've been hiding in the shadows for years.  They're coming out of the woodwork, buying the hats, buying the shirts, and now they're  walking around like they've been fans for years.  They stink.  Shut up.  Let them enjoy their victory.  Ben, I'm happy for Ben though.  I've seen him for many years going through this just misery that it is to be a Sox fan. 
[00:40:00]  But he's a wishy-washy fan, man.  No, no, no.  We have audio of you saying that they weren't going to beat the Yankees.  Yeah, but that's how we think, unfortunately.  Look at all the years.  Yeah, down three games to the Yankees and audio.  I think you'd hear audio from anybody.  Yeah.  I was going to say, we got audio of Curt Schilling even.  You're right.  Okay.  You know, yeah, Schilling was going to have to have his leg amputated.  The Yankees were up three games. 
[00:40:30]  Schilling's leg was going to be amputated.  Damon couldn't swat a fly.  And it was over.  And then all of a sudden, they decide to come and play.  Schilling got a bionic leg.  And everything turned.  And the Yankees fell apart.  And now they're up three games, Boston, for the World Series.  And I congratulate the Sox.  And I look at Ben, and I'm happy for him.  And I'm happy for all you stupid Sox fans that have, for years,  been chanting, Yankee suck, Yankee suck. 
[00:41:00]  And, you know, go screw.  But I'm happy for you.  Enjoy this World Series, because the team is going to be completely different next year.  Oh, my God.  They're going to dismantle that damn thing.  And it's going to be a short-lived victory.  Name another team that they did that to.  The Marlins?  The Marlins.  The Marlins, right.  That was one of the big ones.  Why did I say Tampa Bay?  Well, the football team went from winning the Super Bowl to just sucking.  I think they did that to the 86 Mets, too, didn't they?  I don't know if they did it immediately.  I mean, like, you know, Hojo and a few of those guys left. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know how long they did.  No, the Marlins is the perfect thing to have.  The Marlins is the big one.  They just dismantled the team.  Yeah, they couldn't even have that next year where everyone could enjoy the fans and stuff.  Here's our World Series team.  No.  So what hated Sox are we going to see on the Yankees?  Pedro.  Pedro.  They're saying there's going to be a Yankee.  I might see George go get Ortiz, too.  I would like George to go over there and just take Ortiz.  Would that just be the worst thing you could possibly do?  Big lefty swing in Yankee Stadium.  He was auditioning for the Yankees.  That's all he was doing. 
[00:42:00]  An audition.  All this is is an audition for the Yankees next year.  What a freak show he is.  I love him, though.  Oh, man.  I really like the guy.  I can't even hate him.  No.  A black guy with a thin beard like that?  You have to love it.  With that little boy band beard.  He used the little boy band razor to cut that thing with.  It's called the Chinstrap.  The Chinstrap?  I should get one.  It sounds like some kind of gay porno device.  It's called the Chinstrap.  The Chinstrap, huh?  Hey, let's say hi to Brain Dead in South Carolina.  What's up, Brain Dead?  Good morning, guys. 
[00:42:30]  Hey.  Hey.  You know, I've got to say, any organization that's based in Washington, D.C., in my mind,  is doomed for failure.  Okay?  Huh?  Right along with XM Radio.  All right.  Thank you.  Why, sir?  I think he's talking about the technical glitches we had and overcame this morning.  Because Jaime's in town.  He was not happy either.  He looked really, really irritated.  Oh, he came busting in here.  Let me at it. 
[00:43:00]  Clear the field.  No more smiling.  Some men are going to fix some equipment.  And, man, did he fix the equipment.  He did, in record time.  Well, but unfortunately, now we can't hook up the PlayStation 2 to play Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas.  Why not?  Well, we were going to use that microphone to mic the TV so we could listen in on the  game a little bit.  I think you could hear it out of my mic.  Like, if it gets loud.  You son of a bitch.  Well, we got the new game in studio.  We got the PlayStation 2.  We were going to have Steve just kind of play the game.  Because Steve can't really work for us this week because he doesn't have a production studio. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, thanks, Steve.  I got a phone call, a text message, and an email saying how great Grand Theft Auto is.  And I didn't have it.  So I'm sitting at home reading his emails about how much fun he's having playing.  Best game ever.  Like, gee, thanks, Steve.  Rub it in a little more.  I'm beating the crack dealer over the head with an aluminum badge.  There you go.  Were you sitting there just in a pair of boxer briefs with a long-sleeved flame shirt tucked  into it?  Scratching his crotch and then smelling his fingers and playing on. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, God.  His onion-y.  Onion-y.  Onion-y.  Scratching his ball vein with, like, that stupid skull ring with the middle finger.  Old Funyun sack just playing away.  Hey, Steve and Jersey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Come on.  Sitting out here on the parkway right now, kicking off the first Jersey Shore sticker  stop this morning.  Oh!  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, this is the promotion for the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our listeners, actually, beg for stickers, beg for the wow stickers, and then they go 
[00:44:30]  out and hand them out to people.  I'm sitting here with a fistful of stickers right off the northbound parkway, sitting  down in front of this little shithole of a rest stop here.  Okay.  Silver Dodge Ram pickup.  Anybody wants to come up here?  You know, show a little fun bag my way, whatever.  Hey, that's fine.  Later on this afternoon, 12 o'clock to 2, we're going to be sitting outside the Chili's  at Monmouth Mall also.  All right.  First wow there, it gets a beer bought by me, so.  All right.  Thank you, man. 
[00:45:00]  Absolutely.  See, this is how you treat a high-profile radio show.  You get your listeners to get about a dozen stickers, and you send them out there to hand  them out to our listeners.  Atta boy!  Hey, thank you for the promotion.  12 stickers will be out there on the road, Opie.  12 stickers today.  12 more stickers.  And I understand that XM has solved the problem.  They're going to put sticks with stickers on them along the highway and call them little  billboards.  Look, guys.  Oh, little billboard.  This bucket of good stuff is just to the tippy top. 
[00:45:30]  It's overflowing with opportunity and things to be done.  My bucket overfloweth.  12 stickers.  Yeah, the guy's got a few stickers, and he's going to promote the show today for us.  Thank you.  Well, someone has to do it, right?  It's a grassroots campaign we're running.  Like Ralph Nader, Opie, and we have just as big a chance.  Yeah, it's a grassroots thing, of course.  The grass is all burnt out except for a little patch here and a little patch there, but it's  a grassroots operation. 
[00:46:00]  Of course it is.  As far as promoting the ONA show.  Tim in New Hampshire, what's going on?  Opie, what's happening, buddy?  Hey, man.  Welcome back, guys.  Hey, listen.  Opie, you've got to do me a favor, buddy.  Don't get canned yet, man.  I'm going to go nuts if I've got to deal with this and the Stern for another two freaking  years.  What a loser that guy is.  Well, we're not planning on getting canned.  We just want people to listen to the new Opie and Anthony show.  Absolutely.  But you guys talk bashing Washington.  You're killing me.  Nah, I think they'll get over it. 
[00:46:30]  They've got to just step up a little bit.  That's all.  We've got to give them a step-up speech.  That's what it is.  Well, you know, it's justified today.  You start the radio show and it's called the Opie and Anthony show and you can't hear  Anthony.  Because the Anthony mic isn't on.  It doesn't work.  That's sort of a problem, don't you think?  Yeah, I'd say so.  Hey, listen.  I was trying to talk to you guys.  We don't want to call the show Opie and the guy that wasn't quoted in the New York Times  article.  Oh, don't rub it in. 
[00:47:00]  The poor little guy.  Look at the little guy, all dejected.  Oh, gee, guys.  But I...  Opie and I thought I would have a quote in the New York Times exclusive article.  Not even a quote.  I thought there might be a mention.  Not a quote.  I didn't care about a quote.  Because I was only throwing in kind of add-on thoughts, like tacking on semicolons to thoughts.  You know what it is, though?  You were jumping in and throwing in stuff and I could see by your expression, you would  think to yourself after you were done, oh, that was a good point. 
[00:47:30]  That's going to be impressive.  He's going to use that.  The Opie and I hope they get the back of my head as they're taking pictures of Opie and  Anthony show.  I made some very valid points.  Excuse my language, but I think you made some darn good points.  Well, let's not get that crazy here.  I don't want to throw off any new listeners with the filth.  You know, you guys are a little dirty.  Eight dollars a month.  What?  No, just, you know, oh, we better, better, better keep it away from moms and kids.  It's a dirty show.  Oh, I might say the F word.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi.  Makes me sick.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York City.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  This is Tony Danza, The Real Idiot.  My heart's thoughts and prayers go out to you guys.  I know how it feels.  I have technical problems because my cameraman doesn't want to shut up.  I know how it feels.  I know how it feels.  I was on the website last night.  I was looking at the, um, those, uh, public service announcements and I got bored.  If the shits and giggles, I poured some hot coffee over Angela and Samantha. 
[00:48:30]  And then my daughter Rita came with such a lovely girl and holds them off with cold water.  I wanted to smack that bitch last night.  All right, Tony.  Very good, Tony.  No one to punch out.  That's right.  Punch out, Tony.  Punch out.  There he goes.  Bye, Tony.  Good job by Tony in New York City.  Hey, you guys remember Chad from Sacramento yesterday?  He fell asleep on the phone.  He was on hold and, uh, every time we went to him, we just heard him snoring.  We had him on hold for, I think, three and a half hours.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, long distance call.  Well, Chad's back.  Hey, Chad.  What the fuck is up, O&A? 
[00:49:00]  How the fuck is it going?  Hey, D.  It doesn't matter in 68 minutes.  Who do I send the bill to?  That's what I'm wondering.  You can give it to me when I'm in Sacramento the 5th and 6th of November, Chad.  Hey, you know you can go to Ticketmaster.com and reserve those tickets, Jim.  Atta boy, Chad.  So, Chad, what happened yesterday?  We put you on hold, I think, very early, like 6.05 East Coast time.  And we finally went to you around, I don't know, 6.45 and you were out cold.  Yeah, it's called 4 Xanax and a 6-pack of Budweiser. 
[00:49:30]  Ooh, party.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you hear yourself snoring on the replay?  Yeah, I kind of felt like an idiot, or a boob, as you called me.  Yeah, you boob.  You were a boob.  Ooh, that's a little tough.  Hey, so anyways.  We broke out the tough language for you.  Boob.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  This guy's ready to fall asleep again.  Yeah, that's too fucking much.  You want to know about this massage parlor, man?  This place is $40 to get in the door.  It's like a half-hour massage, $20 to give you the hand, $40 to give you the head. 
[00:50:00]  So for $60, you get a massage and a handy.  Yeah.  And then for $80, you get a massage and a BJ?  Only problem is that they're all Asian or whatever, so they got like this big old bush  and barely speak English.  Ugh, dumb faces.  Big Asian bush.  What, the Asians don't shave down?  It's from the punchline, though.  No, down there, you know what it looks like down there?  You know those noodles they throw in the pan and they go, they blow up real fast and real  big?  That's what it looks like in their pants when you take the panties off. 
[00:50:30]  This is this big, nasty noodle snatch.  I had no idea that the Asians didn't shave down.  No, very rarely.  Really?  I just don't think they're up with the times.  Yeah, so it's a good place, though?  What is it called?  Oh, you want me to give the name out on the air?  No?  Eh, probably not.  You go there often, though?  Uh, no, but my dad got a divorce like two years ago, so he was all, you know, whatever,  missing it.  Yeah, missing it.  And some DJ kid or whatever told me about it.  And, uh, I don't know.  Dad went down there and did he tell you about it? 
[00:51:00]  Dad got addicted.  He was like going, like, he moved out of state, but now he calls and instead of saying  like, hey, whatever, come to visit, he's like, oh, can't wait to go down to that  place again.  Oh, your dad is telling you about his sexploits?  Hey, nothing's wrong with that.  I went down there with the one.  Well, there is something wrong with that.  One and the other one.  What?  There is something wrong with that.  You don't want to hear from your dad about getting laid.  Yeah, believe me, that's awful.  You know how grossed out I was when my dad walked in a room one time at my parents' house  and he's like, come here, smell my finger. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, he did not.  Of course he didn't.  Well, you never know with him, though.  I know.  I had a question in that line.  Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was one of his awful lines or if it was reality.  I don't want to hear that, your dad.  All right, Chad.  What about my grandma?  You're going to see Norton in Sacramento?  Friday night, man.  All right.  What about your grandma?  No, you don't want to see her?  No, we don't want to see or hear about your grandma either.  I'm emailing you pictures, man.  All right.  We'll check out. 
[00:52:00]  Is she naked?  She could be.  All right, Chad.  Thank you.  Yep.  This was worth the wait.  Yeah, that's what he did.  That's what we were waiting for.  Let's say hi to Max in Tulsa.  What's up, Max?  Oh, hey, and Big Jimmy.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hi, fella.  I think we're finally doing a radio show now.  Let's go.  Hey, you guys are awesome.  I've got a couple quick questions for you.  My 19-year-old son keeps bringing home this chick.  Kind of looks damn near like Juliet.  Ah, crap, that retarded chick. 
[00:52:30]  Juliet Lewis.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And they bang the hell out of each other, and I'm wanting to mic his room up.  I didn't send you guys the audio.  Well, how old is your son?  He's 19.  Oh, okay.  Oh, so he's bringing home some hot chick.  No, it's not.  That's got to suck for a parent.  Pretty much, man.  I'm sitting down in my bathroom in the living room wanting to go squeeze one off.  That's just got to suck for a dad.  Wait a minute.  So your son comes home with this hot piece of ass, goes upstairs, and bangs her, and they're 
[00:53:00]  making a lot of noise, and you're downstairs listening to this?  Pretty much, man.  Because I'm like, usually it's right before I'm going out the door to go to work, and  you know, I couldn't do anything about it if I wanted to, except, you know, he pays rent  every week.  I figure he's legal.  What the hell, right?  Oh, you've got to keep him in the house.  Are you kidding me?  For the cheap thrill.  This guy sounds like he's pretty close to setting up the camera in the room.  Right.  I've thought about that, too.  Yeah, I bet you have.  Are they going to be banging this morning?  I don't know.  I'm not, I haven't made it home yet, but I still got about five or six more hours until 
[00:53:30]  I get home.  If you're a father and you have a son, or even if you have a daughter that's, you know,  17, 18, whatever, 16, and they bring home their friends, you know, a girlfriend, or if  it's a, you know, a sleepover party or something, that's got to drive these guys crazy.  She's got one friend, and I, you know, she's 22 or 23, and she's hit on me a few times,  so I don't know.  I'm going to try to tap that.  I'll see what happens. 
[00:54:00]  Try to tap that.  That's wonderful.  You've got to love this guy, man.  I had a question for Jimmy, though.  Jimmy, some guy said the other day, and I totally agree with him, you've got to be a truck driver  at heart, man, because some of the stuff you come up with is so goddamn funny.  Oh, thank you.  And those truckers are hysterical, so it goes hand in hand that you must be a trucker.  I was wondering if, I don't know if any of you guys wear baseball hats or that kind of  stuff all the time or whatever, but.  Ben would like a Boston Red Sox hat if you could have one specially fitted for a larger 
[00:54:30]  skull.  I was going to see if I could send you guys three hats for my company.  Yeah, send them in, all right?  If you guys would get it, you know, wear that or whatever.  The trucker hats with the mesh on the back, they're the hottest style in America right  now.  And please get a queef today, man.  The other one the other day, goddamn, I love that shit.  All right.  You know, I can't remember which one of you guys don't like it.  I don't know if it's O or A or whoever.  Well, I'm not a big fan of when it happens when you're doing the act or something. 
[00:55:00]  That's pretty rude.  The queef.  I got a good picture of a pregnant chick, too, Opie.  If you guys put me on hold, I can get your fax number, I'll fax it to you.  Sure.  Fax.  What year is this?  Faxing porn?  It's 1988.  Who's faxing anything?  We're back in 1988.  I have the facsimile machine.  It must warm up first.  I'm old school.  What can I say?  But anyhow, you guys have a good one, man.  All right.  We'll try to get another queef going today, but we'll put you on hold and we'll see what 
[00:55:30]  you send us there, okay?  Hey, Bill is stopping by the New Jersey Wow sticker stop, Anthony.  Oh, here we go.  Wow.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  I just stopped at that Monmouth County Parkway stop and got my stickers.  Okay.  I'm sitting there right in the parking lot.  I've got a stack of them.  So I suggest everyone from Jersey to go down there and get some and spread the virus.  All right.  How many stickers does the guy have today?  He had a big stack of them.  He says he's going to Chili's at Monmouth Mall right after.  What's a big stack?  Does he have 100 Wow stickers?  I couldn't see.  It's still dark in Jersey, but he has a big handful, so I'm sure he's got a bunch. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  He's got a handful of stickers that he's handing out today, Anthony.  Opie, we're here in Jersey, and I'm surrounded by ones of people that are here to get their stickers.  Oh, I love how this show works.  It's just amazing.  All right.  Well, the Fan Wow sticker stop seems like it's a huge success there at the New Jersey rest stop, and people wonder why we're so frustrated here. 
[00:56:30]  Wouldn't you think you'd go to a sticker stop, phone call, and you'd hear the O&A chant in the background?  And I'm here where you'd have to really, O&A, I'm here.  I can barely hear what you're saying.  We're at our first 12 boxes of stickers gone already.  We're waiting for some new ones to be brought down, but we're going to be here all day and give out stickers to everybody.  Oh, no pushing, no shoving.  We're going to give out stickers all day.  Back to you guys.  That's the old days, and now here's the new days. 
[00:57:00]  Um, O&A?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Uh, not too much.  I'm here at a sticker stop.  I've got to be quiet, though.  I don't want to wake anyone up.  Oh, wait.  Someone's coming.  Yeah?  Uh, okay.  A guy just put a sharpened screwdriver in my back, and I've had to give him all my money and the 12 stickers that I brought.  So the stop is, uh, the sticker stop's ending.  But thanks for trying to help us out today.  We appreciate it, right?  Oh, okay, guys.  All right, bye.  What happened? 
[00:57:30]  And people wonder why we're frustrated.  What happened?  This is not what we're used to.  This is different than what it used to be.  He's at a sticker stop in the pitch black.  It is, it could not be darker out.  How are you going to show people the stickers through the glory hole in between the two toilet stalls?  A guy's waving his mule at you.  You go, look, wow.  Just a freshly rolled up wow sticker comes through the hole.  Here you go.  Oh, wait.  This one's on my car?  We're spreading the virus. 
[00:58:00]  You pull it back through.  His saliva's all over it.  Yeah.  Oh.  What happened?  There's a few errant pubes that were around the hole sticking to the sticky part of the sticker.  This is really not what we're used to.  No.  Well, I think that's great.  You have to understand.  You guys got to look at the positive.  If you have 30,000 sticker stops like this, you're going to get a real message out there.  Right.  30,000 stickers.  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday, and I guess they got the system in place finally.  Yeah.  So if you go to opiananthony.com, you'll leave your address. 
[00:58:30]  They will mail the wow sticker out hopefully by the end of the year.  Mm-hmm.  And then, you know, that's always good because, you know, December's a great time for girls  to flash because it's so warm out.  To wow, sure.  So thank you for that.  And they'll send out the wow stickers, and you put that on your vehicle.  It means whip them out whenever at this point.  And if a girl sees the wow on your vehicle, they just may flash you.  And you know how those stickers stick so well to a nice icy bumper?  They'll be peeling off by January. 
[00:59:00]  Eh, we're in no hurry.  No.  No hurry.  Moving at a snail's pace.  Thank you.  Hey, Nick from Columbus.  What's going on?  Hey, not much, guys.  I love the show.  I started listening to you like a month before you guys went off the air at WNEW, but love  the show.  Got a quick suggestion for you, though.  Oh.  Could you guys put like a schedule on ona.com that we could kind of figure out when the  show starts and the next one stops?  Well, that's kind of a work in progress. 
[00:59:30]  We're trying to figure it out where it makes sense for everybody.  We're starting to throw the idea around where we actually start this radio show live at  7 a.m.  Well, I mean, I love to hear you guys, and I try and catch your show all day long, but  I never know exactly where I'm at in the show sometimes because I think we're a second ship.  I think right now, as it stands, it's 6 to 10 a.m. live on the East Coast, and then goes  right into a replay from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then right into another replay from 2 p.m. 
[01:00:00]  to 6 p.m.  I think that's it, right?  Oh.  Got the rundown.  I believe.  There you go.  And then I think there's another replay right at 6.  So it pretty much replays all the way to 10 o'clock at night here on the East Coast.  But we'll definitely talk to Washington, and we'll definitely have that schedule up for  you by early March.  All right.  You guys rock.  Norton, you are the awesomest, man.  I love listening to your shit all over the radio.  That stuff about being in prison.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, buddy.  Being in prison.  It's one of my older bits.  Ah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, about sucking sea in prison.  Mm-hmm.  If you have no choice, you want me to do the bit for you?  Please do.  I've heard your material so many times.  Because I'm sucking, really, a gallon of snot up through my nose.  I keep moving the microphone away, so you're probably better off doing it.  All right.  Wow.  Sacramento.  We got two already from Sacramento.  D.C., what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  I was doing a little late-night studying, and I was looking through one of my books  here, and it has in here a story about you guys.  It says, The Last Rites of Opie and Dopey. 
[01:01:00]  The Last Rites of Opie and Dopey.  We're in a textbook?  Yes, you are.  For what class?  Public Relations.  Public Relations.  What's the name of the textbook?  The Practice of Public Relations.  All right.  And then it says, What About Us?  It talks about the Sex for Sam incident.  How wrong do they get it?  Yeah, read out of your textbook a little bit.  They may have signaled the end for Anything Goes Radio.  Two New York shock jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:01:30]  Found that out in the fall of 2002 when their Infinity Corporation station offered cash prizes  sponsored by Sam Adams Lager for couples willing to have sex in public places during the broadcast.  We made a textbook?  A textbook.  That's almost as good as being a Jeopardy question.  All right.  So it was in the fall, they said?  Yeah.  That's good.  I didn't realize August was in the fall.  All right, good.  Fact one, wrong.  Asshole educators.  There's, like, textbooks are right? 
[01:02:00]  Half that crap in them are false.  Well, you guys made it in the same chapter as Trent Lott and Value Jet.  Really?  Value Jet?  All right.  What else does it say about us in the textbook?  Ah, let's see.  The primary lesson.  In crisis, when the organization's reputation is at stake, individuals are expendable.  Ah, very good.  Yeah, we learned that.  Lop off the heads.  Yes, yes.  And then the subordinate lesson.  Careful, Howard Stern.  You could be next.  Hoo-hoo.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  Well, that textbook really gets to the meat of the issue.  Aren't textbooks so exciting?  Oh, a drivel.  Especially when read on radio.  By someone with such an exciting voice as DC.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, DC.  Well, he's tired.  It's only four in the morning there.  And ONA, Opie and Anthony, Texas A-Pass, and the textbook.  Hey, Ken, what's going on?  Kenny.  What's up, buddy?  Is it me?  Yes.  If your name's Ken, yes. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  I kind of went right into it.  Yeah, it's got a story I thought you guys might enjoy.  All right.  About a month or two ago, I was, you know, me and my wife, she's a little ski woman.  Been married about six years.  So I had to switch it up a little bit, go on the back door.  And, you know, she's whining instead of her, so I stopped.  Later on that day, we were, or next day, we were out at the mall.  And I saw this woman in a wheelchair with her, you know, pretty good-sized boyfriend.  Looked at my wife, and I guess I said, a little bit too loud.  And I looked at her, and I said, oh, I bet that woman let me stick in her ass. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe I should go home with her.  Well, I got hit by my wife, and I almost got the ass kicked by the boyfriend over there, too.  Well, that was a silly thing to say.  I thought it would be a funny thing, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I meant to say a little bit quieter.  I didn't mean for anybody to really hear me except for my wife.  It was the first time you tried going for the ass in six years?  Yeah, well, I drive a truck.  I don't get home too often.  I'm right now in Iowa, and, you know, it's always fun. 
[01:04:00]  But, you know, I get a little bit of time off.  Hard to believe your wife didn't go for that.  A spouse usually loves to hear her husband making jokes about raping a woman in a wheelchair.  I could just tip her against the curb and then fuck her while her face is in the grass, and she's crying.  Can't believe your wife didn't go for that one, sir.  I'm going to get all damp with that one.  Hey, when you turned her around and tried to put it in, did she make a beep, beep, beep sound?  A little trucker humor for you, sir. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys have a good morning.  Yeah, we're trying.  What were you trying to tell me before the show, by the way?  Huh?  You were trying to tell me something before the show.  Oh, Jimmy's not very observant.  Yeah, we're just trying to see if you're observant.  I'm very observant.  All right.  What do you got?  What do I got?  Yeah.  Half a rod and a stain on my shirt.  No.  What?  Look around.  Try to figure something out today.  Try to figure what out?  Something that is going on here in the studio that you should have taken notice of.  It's not too big a deal where you'd be like, you know. 
[01:05:00]  I'm not going to know.  I'm going to hear it.  I'm going to go, oh.  No.  When you find out, it's going to give you like 15 minutes of material.  You did tell me before that there's something I should be noticing.  Yeah.  You would make a horrendous witness.  It has to do with us.  You would make an absolutely horrendous witness.  I'm a very good witness.  Yeah.  All right.  It has to do with you two?  Yeah.  Open ant?  Yeah.  You're firing me?  No.  No. 
[01:05:30]  A boy could dream.  It's about Ant and I.  All right.  Everyone else noticed.  It's a little embarrassing.  Embarrassing?  Yeah.  It's a little embarrassing.  He just noticed.  It only took an hour and a half.  How awful is this?  Look, now he's all like, ugh.  I didn't want to look at him.  I know.  Now he doesn't want to look. 
[01:06:00]  How stupid.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I know.  You want to explain?  Yeah.  I don't know how I didn't notice this, but not only is Ope wearing a horrendous shirt,  but Ant is wearing the exact same horrendous shirt.  Anthony and I today have officially become twins.  The Bobsy twins.  What are you two?  The Bobsy twins? 
[01:06:30]  Holy shit.  How awful is this?  Let's just start dressing the same.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  We did not do this on purpose.  Yeah.  Call up.  What are you wearing today, Ope?  Right, right, right.  I got that shirt.  I'll wear that.  So I walked in with my stupid little gap whatever shirt.  It's one of those long sleeve blue type thermal with the white stitching around the wrist area,  the shoulder area, neck.  Yeah.  It's really, really awful.  I'm sitting here and Anthony walks in about quarter to five and he's wearing the same exact 
[01:07:00]  shirt.  And we have to go to John McEnroe and tape a little thing with them today.  They're doing B-roll here in like an hour.  Yeah, they're doing B-roll here.  John McEnroe's coming in.  Well, his film crew is coming in to roll some B-roll, yeah.  Maybe they can bring you on to the McEnroe set while someone is singing two peas in a pod.  How's that?  Sure.  No, I will be going home and changing my shirt.  We're not walking out on TV with the same T-shirt. 
[01:07:30]  I'm in.  And we're a team.  Right.  We say that at the same time.  The last line.  The Doublemint twins.  This is awful.  Isn't it terrible?  I can't even look at them today.  Why?  It's cute.  You both have the same little outfit on.  Like the two girls from The Shining.  I just want to axe both of you in the hallway.  We should get you on one side of the doorway, me on the other, and we'll make believe we're  looking in a mirror.  And we'll try to do the same moves.  Maybe we can do that on McEnroe.  Yeah, you can pick up one bucket.  You can pick up another. 
[01:08:00]  We both obviously thought that this was our best shirt for TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  You know what?  The truth of the matter is, I just completely don't care.  I completely do not care.  I don't even open up that stupid closet and look in there and go, oh, are we taping something?  Or, oh, who's coming in for the show today?  I will grab the first thing that is staring me in the face on that hanger and just run.  And apparently it was a picture of Opie in that shirt. 
[01:08:30]  That is pretty embarrassing.  How many of the same clothes do we have?  I think this is it.  This is it?  Did you buy that yourself or did a girl buy that for you?  I bought this myself.  You did?  Yeah.  I don't buy any of my own clothes.  Haven't in years.  Yeah, I bought this myself.  My girlfriend comes home with my clothes.  Like, yeah, I was out at The Gap or I was out at wherever.  Banana Republic.  Here you go.  Here's a shirt.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to try to get this show back on track. 
[01:09:00]  I've been very distracted today.  We've got Steve-O coming in in a little while.  Ortiz has a white wife?  Yes.  Really?  Yes, he does.  What does she look like?  She's blonde.  A blonde wife?  I have a picture of her.  Does she have a big butt?  I don't know.  I have a picture of him and her and the little kid.  I might actually have a big butt.  Oh, they have a kid too, huh?  Yeah.  Boy, that just must look like a rape at night, huh?  What?  Sorry.  You know what's funny?  Give me a little ring.  There we go.  That was very inappropriate.  I shouldn't have said that.  A buddy of mine saw him in a steak restaurant after one of the games up in Boston and just 
[01:09:30]  said he had like two of the biggest pieces of steak you could ever imagine.  Of course.  Because he didn't just sink his teeth into a cow's neck right there in a pasture.  Unbelievable.  That blonde wife, did he, I think I saw that picture you're talking about.  He grabbed her and climbed up the Empire State Building, started swatting at biplanes.  Was that the picture?  I saw that picture.  It was pretty good.  No? 
[01:10:00]  Should have had a bat.  He would have hit more of the planes, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  The blonde wife probably has a pretty big dumper though, right?  You would think.  Because that's kind of the stereotype.  The picture I have of them is, it's from Boston Magazine.  It's just the two of their faces and the little kid.  Big doors open up and there he is.  How about where you parked your car yesterday? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, great.  For the press conference?  We'll talk about that next.  Isn't that nice?  Let me just park the most stolen vehicle in the country in the worst neighborhood in New York.  Yeah, sure.  And I didn't help matters when I started pounding on the side window.  I've never seen Anthony so pissed in my life.  I wish, son of a bitch.  I'm looking at my Palm Pilot.  I'm just kind of trying to find some info out.  And Opie comes up and bangs on the passenger window.  Really hard.  Like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  He jumped. 
[01:11:00]  He was parked next to the projects.  Five minutes before that, some crackhead came over banging on the window and points at his stomach and starts rubbing it.  Like he wanted me to, like, I have food in there for him.  I'll give him money.  He had a bellyache.  He wanted you to rub his stomach a little bit.  Rub my tummy.  He was like, I have a little acid reflux that I'm supposed to sing on SNL tonight.  I was reading his lips through the window that I would absolutely not roll down and the locks that I wouldn't unlatch.  Ooh, what an awful neighborhood.  Yeah, it was right in front of the projects. 
[01:11:30]  Right in front of the projects.  And I'm parking the car there.  And, oh, Opie comes banging on the window.  Thanks.  You jumped out of your skin.  Scared the crap out of me.  No, I'm sorry.  Opie, where did you park your Escalade?  I don't have an Escalade.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got a sponsor, Anthony.  No way.  Yeah.  Who do we have?  Klee Motors.  Hi, I'm Ed Klee, owner of Klee Motors, home of the Klee Jeep, Klee Volvo, and the Klee Taurus. 
[01:12:00]  Let's see what some of our satisfied women owners have to say about their Klee Taurus.  I just love my Klee Taurus.  Hey, who wouldn't?  When I need to get away, I lean back and get lost in my Klee Taurus.  Many women say that a Klee Taurus is easy to maintain.  Here to tell you about the easy maintenance of a Klee Taurus is crack mechanic Michael Hunt.  Because your Klee Taurus is so sensitive, we recommend that you have it looked at in service at least once every three months. 
[01:12:30]  If not lubed up regularly, your parts are going to get gummed up and they won't work.  And, hey, that stinks.  Thanks, Mike.  The guys at Klee Motors are always eager to not only service my Klee Taurus,  but it's the fact that they take the time to polish it and buff it to a spit shine that keeps me coming back.  Thanks, Ed.  That's what I'm here for.  It was our anniversary, and my husband wanted to get me an unforgettable surprise. 
[01:13:00]  I searched and searched, and admittedly, I had a little trouble finding it.  Imagine my excitement when he finally came across my Klee Taurus.  Thanks, Ed.  Don't thank me.  Thank my staff.  For looks and feel, you can't lick a Klee Taurus.  I don't drive my Klee Taurus.  It drives me wild.  A Klee Taurus is hard to find, but it is worth the effort.  Let me, Ed Klee, help you find your Klee Taurus.  Today, at Klee Motors, off of Route 69, you'll find us right next to Cox Liquors. 
[01:13:30]  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me,  Hey, show me your cans!  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors, and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great!  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I saw this wino. 
[01:14:00]  He was eating grapes.  He's like, dude, you have to wait.  I like to drink red wine.  This girl says, doesn't red wine give you a headache?  Yeah, eventually.  But the first and the middle part are amazing.  I'm not going to stop doing something because of what happens at the end.  Mitch, do you want an apple?  No, eventually it'll be a core. 
[01:14:30]  I went to the store, bought eight apples.  The clerk said, do you want me to put them in a bag?  I said, oh no, man, I juggle.  But I can only juggle eight.  If I'm ever here buying nine apples, fucking bag them up.  I saw a guy juggling chainsaws.  It was cool, but unless something needed to be sawed down,  then it's just annoying.  It's like, come on, Rick, can we use one?  Track number five will not be Chainsaw Juggling. 
[01:15:00]  It will be this one.  I was going to have my teeth whitened,  but then I said, fuck that, I'll just get a tan instead.  I got some tartar-controlled toothpaste.  I still got tartar, but that shit's under control.  If the tartar gets out of line, I'm like, come on, man, you know the deal. 
[01:15:30]  Let's fall in.  You crazy-ass tartar.  I got so much tartar, I don't have to dip my fish sticks in shit.  That's actually kind of gross, you know.  After that joke, I always clarify that I'm just joking.  I don't know how much tartar I actually had.  I believe it's the average amount. 
[01:16:00]  If we all did a tartar test right now,  my name would be right in the fucking middle.  I would like to go fishing and catch a fish stick.  That would be convenient.  I could easily get a job with Mrs. Paul's.  They'd just put me in a boat with some empty boxes.  And I would return them to the freezer section of your  neighborhood grocery store. 
[01:16:30]  The owner of the fishing show on TV,  they catch the fish, but they let it go.  They don't want to eat the fish,  but they do want to make it late for something.  Where were you?  I got caught.  Bullshit.  Let me see the inside of your lip.  Fish are always eating other fish.  If fish could scream, the ocean would be loud as shit.  You would not want to submerge your head.  Nothing but fish going, ah, fuck.  I thought I looked like that rock. 
[01:17:00]  It's everything.  24-7-XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  The very worst of the O.P. and Anthony F.U.  line.  Well, I leave a nice funk view to the assholes in Washington.  We goddamn, do we have to hear that? 
[01:17:30]  Hey, this will is goddamn every day.  Can we come up with some music or something?  I mean, what the fuck?  I'd like to just send a big buck view to the big head cable contractors in North Carolina  that chatted me out of my fucking pay.  Only paid me $247 fucking dollars for the whole fucking week.  Yo, this is Joe from Chicago.  Fuck you, Howard Stern.  Fuck you, man, Kyle.  You're both fucking pussies, especially fucking Howard Stern.  You're an asshole conspiracy asshole. 
[01:18:00]  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming up about 7.30 is our old friend Steve-O.  Sorry about that.  Steve-O.  A little bit distracted today.  Yeah, Steve-O's coming in and he's going to do some stuff.  What's he going to do?  Does he have his latest thing that he does? 
[01:18:30]  He never disappoints, man.  I remember last time he was in on our show, he was going around to all the stations and  on TV doing that staple through his scrotum gag.  He would staple his scrotum to his leg.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he did some other stuff on our show.  Remember, he did...  One of the best things I liked was Dee, his chick.  His co-core girlfriend.  His co-core girlfriend, Dee, who had beautiful cans.  I don't think he's with her anymore.  We'll find out.  Probably not.  We'll get the Steve-O update, but... 
[01:19:00]  She put a cue ball from a pool table right between her lovely cans as Steve-O laid on  the floor and she released the cue ball.  It rolled down her lovely cleavage, fell about four feet right onto Steve-O's skull.  The noise it made on the radio.  Man.  Man, man, man.  I don't know.  He seems to have no concern for his own safety.  I'm just amazed he's still alive.  Well, that TV show that they're doing, The Wild Boys, is that it? 
[01:19:30]  Very funny and very dangerous.  They don't seem to care.  They're bitten by animals, almost torn apart by wild cats, crocodile.  When he had the meat hanging out of his thong underwear, he had meat hanging out of the  ass part of it, and he's trying to go over a pond with alligators in it, and they're snapping  at his ass.  Hysterical.  The guy doesn't care.  Well, we'll see what he has for us today, right?  Yeah.  All right, so we were at the press conference yesterday, Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  This is huge news for XM Satellite Radio.  Press conference.  Yes.  We were there at the marquee in the middle of the ghetto.  Yeah, right by the projects.  It was pretty scary, parking there and then having to cross the street.  There was some guy, New York homeless people are amazing, or whatever you want to call  them, hobos.  The guy was carrying around sharpened sticks, and then he had a metal stud that you use 
[01:20:30]  when you're building walls, kind of cut in half and duct taped.  Like, he had a whole backpack full of weapons, these primitive weapons.  Maybe he was going to LARP with his friends or something.  He was going hunting.  Was he going hunting?  He was going urban hunting?  He was getting lunch.  And these people just walk around the streets, and if you say anything, if you mention it,  then you're a bad guy.  But they should be rounded up.  Round them up.  The guy's walking around with weapons in the middle of the ghetto. 
[01:21:00]  In the projects.  That's normal for the ghetto, though.  Yeah, it's a little frightening if you have to go to a press conference in the neighborhood,  though.  Ben told me he saw someone getting pretty much beat up a little bit in the back of a taxi.  Getting tuned up.  I didn't know this was going on in New York City.  Oh, there's plenty of them.  There's undercover taxis.  Undercover taxis.  Oh, I know.  I pull behind a cab in the same neighborhood, and I noticed on the rear deck, there's the  red and blue lights.  And there you know. 
[01:21:30]  It's a cop car.  It's not a taxi cab.  Steve and I were driving around looking for a parking spot.  Steve goes, holy cow, look, there's two cops in the taxi.  And of course, you know, there's an undesirable in the back, screaming and yelling,  plead his case.  An undesirable, Ben?  Why do you call him an undesirable?  Yeah, you said that.  He's from Boston, racist?  No, you said that about your Sirius Radio and how you had to put a hat over it a couple  weeks ago.  You said you have to prevent the undesirable, so you put a hat over your Sirius Radio.  Because I, you know, let me explain.  I do have both companies in the car, okay?  Because we weren't sure where we wanted to go, and it was obvious we had to come to 
[01:22:00]  XM Satellite Radio over the little doggy company.  How long is that free subscription going to go for, Ope?  I don't know.  How long do you think they're going to pay for you to get their service?  I haven't even turned it on in a really long time.  But they told me to go to whatever, one of these car places, car stereo places, to get  my unit installed.  This thing is a hunk of junk on my dashboard.  Yeah.  They messed up my dashboard.  It's a huge metal plate that's where they had to solder down onto my really nice dashboard. 
[01:22:30]  Holes were drilled into my console.  It's as big as a CB radio.  Yeah.  I mean, the thing is huge.  Absolutely huge.  And when the sun comes beaming through the windshield, the thing gets up to about 300,  350 degrees.  You can't touch the thing to change the channels.  I'm not kidding, because it's like some kind of silver top.  So I can't remove this thing without pretty much messing up my dashboard for life.  I can't. 
[01:23:00]  So what I do is I put a hat over, and that's my security system, because I don't want someone  now screwing up my car to try to get this CB radio out of it.  To rip that out of it.  Isn't it amazing that they actually have a unit that they have to drill holes in your vehicle?  I had two holes drilled in the Pathfinder when I turned it in, and I had to take all the  equipment out, and I'm like, now I've got to turn this in with two holes drilled in the  dashboard.  Unbelievable.  So yes, I said to protect my stuff from the undesirables. 
[01:23:30]  You're right.  I've got to know how you found a hat big enough to fit over that thing.  It's one of those...  Hello, Ben?  You know what it is?  It's one of those un-golden pond hats.  One of those big, awful...  Oh, the big fishing hats?  ...un-golden pond hats.  So I put that on the dashboard, making believe the hat's just on the dashboard.  I got lost in the woods.  It's a big hunk of junk underneath that hat.  You're on my knight in shining armor.  I just shit my pants.  So, but speaking of technology, Anthony... 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  So we were at the press conference yesterday in the hood, and...  I'll tell you one thing, XM knows how to put on a press conference.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  It was like all the bells and whistles.  Except for the commercial with Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, that wasn't Charles Nelson Reilly.  Huh.  You're talking about the commercial for the new unit?  Yeah, for the Mi-Fi.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  They found Charles Nelson Reilly to do the commercial for the new Delphi XM Mi-Fi. 
[01:24:30]  It was Elton John.  It was Elton John.  What is going on with Elton John?  I know XM loves the guy, but...  Oh!  I know XM loves the guy, but the commercial was a little, little...  You know what?  Yes, I do have an open mind.  Yes.  Goodbye, Norma Jean.  Oh!  Yeah.  Oh!  I do have an open mind.  I don't mind the gay.  Okay?  I really don't.  Yeah.  Okay?  Not a good word to use, but I tolerate the gay, okay? 
[01:25:00]  You tolerate them.  Well, thank you, Opie.  I'm sure they're so happy to hear that today.  Thank you so much that the gay community can look and say, well, at least Opie tolerates  it.  Sure, as you're sitting here dressed exactly like another man.  Glad you tolerate them.  I came in first, which means I put this shirt on before Anthony, so Anthony was copying me.  Came in or came out?  I woke up first.  How do you know?  I had this shirt on at what time?  Dude, I couldn't sleep.  I was up at three. 
[01:25:30]  What time did you put that shirt on?  Be honest.  I will be very honest with you.  I put this shirt on at four...  Ten.  It's probably the same time I put this shirt on.  Of course it is.  Well, because twins think alike.  Yeah.  I was like, we're officially twins.  I guess when Opie put the shirt on, it felt like a shirt was being pulled on me.  I swear.  Can we get some chick to moan?  We need something on the show today.  Jesus.  Someone take on Illinois as the sexiest state. 
[01:26:00]  Help us out here.  Anyway, so I don't mind the gay, but watching that commercial, man, you want to talk about  uber gay.  Oh, he looked like...  Was he wearing one of those ascots or a kerchief around his neck?  I don't know what it was.  Little pink Charles Nelson Reilly kerchief.  He is, though.  His face and everything is looking like Charles Nelson Reilly.  It's frightening.  But he was, you know, he's on board, Opie.  He's on board.  I believe he's the spokesperson for the new MiFi. 
[01:26:30]  The MiFi?  He was carrying it around, listening.  This MiFi is just making the competition over.  Oh, yeah.  Between the two companies, because the little doggy company will not even come close to  this anytime soon.  No, no.  Basically, it's the Delphi XM MiFi.  It's the first portable XM satellite radio, Anthony.  Yeah, like you'd carry around an iPod.  It's a cool-looking iPod type of thing, you know? 
[01:27:00]  It's futuristic.  It's kind of rounded on the top and rounded on the bottom there.  Yeah.  It's got a nice little shape to it.  It's $350.  It's going to be a nice Christmas gift for a lot of people out there.  Makes a great stocking stuffer.  But what's cool is you can walk around Manhattan.  It's lightweight, too, you know?  Kind of like, I mean, just picture kind of, yeah, the iPod, more or less.  Totally portable and self-contained.  It's not like they give you this unit and then you've got to hook it up to something huge.  Right.  And they call it portable. 
[01:27:30]  No, no, no, no.  It's all self-contained.  You can hear all 130 XM channels on this thing as you're walking around.  And then this is cool.  It's got a memory mode.  You can store up to five hours of fresh new playlists effortlessly.  Yeah, say you work in the bowels of a building where no radio penetrates, satellite, regular radio, nothing.  You could record this wonderful program you're hearing now and then play the whole thing back.  Yeah, so you can listen to us whenever you want.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  That's unbelievable.  That's a great feature.  Listen in the subway if you want.  Or let's say you're taking a flight.  Oh, there you go.  Load up your favorite channels and your favorite shows and you're good to go.  This thing works in the car, in the home, and as you're walking around.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Built-in wireless FM transmitter too, Anthony.  Really?  Ah, yes.  And it has a stock ticker.  Yeah, if you get stock quotes, sports scores, and a clock.  And a clock. 
[01:28:30]  They're pushing the clock feature, Opie.  And it's going to be available in late November, so very exciting news from the company.  Just in time for Christmas.  They had a...  Now I understand why the company hasn't paid any attention to us since we signed with XM Satellite Radio.  They were busy with all this other stuff.  Oh, they're in the laboratory.  They're in the laboratory creating new devices and signing up Major League Baseball.  So maybe we should have a little patience.  Getting PowerPoint presentations together for their press conferences.  Did you see that?  Did you see when Hugh Panera took the stage and everyone starts clapping? 
[01:29:00]  Didn't you feel like you were in a cult?  I felt like I was in a cult.  Sort of, yeah.  Like, gets up there and it's like, and we're introducing, you know, the MiFi.  And they show, they unveiled the two MiFis on stage.  It was underneath some black material.  And they unveil it for everybody.  Da-da!  Yeah, yeah.  And they're playing the 2001 music.  And you hear the crowd like, oh!  And there's Hugh with his arms up just like looking like the man, you know.  And everyone's clapping and looking lovingly. 
[01:29:30]  And I felt like I should drink some Kool-Aid and drop dead.  It was amazing.  What a moment.  I, quite frankly, didn't notice all that, Anthony.  I had my Nikes on and I was underneath some purple material waiting for the UFO to come.  I didn't notice any of that because I was too busy looking at the hot pieces of asses that were giving us our drinks yesterday afternoon.  There were hot girls there?  The waitresses?  Which, who are you talking about?  The two blonde waitresses?  I really never even noticed waitresses that were the two hottest chicks on the face of the earth. 
[01:30:00]  They were pretty much flirting with everyone and making everyone think that they could have sex with them.  The girls that were working this place, there were two waitresses.  They were wearing the shortest mini skirts.  Black, tight.  Tiny, tiny black mini skirts right below their coochies.  Ass cheek.  It was like ass cheek level.  Right.  And then the tops they had were also tight, but the holes for their arms were kind of big. 
[01:30:30]  So you could see the side of breast showing right through.  And they're walking around serving everybody.  And no one could take their eyes off of these girls.  They were distracted.  Like, Hugh is up there.  And that's what everyone's there for.  Hugh Pinero's talking about the MIFI.  But everyone had their backs turned to Hugh.  It was distracting.  It really was.  You're trying to listen to Hugh and watch it and see what he's got to say and see what he's talking about.  And look at the MIFI and the PowerPoint presentation going on on the screens. 
[01:31:00]  And no, no one's looking.  Every time those girls passed by, everybody's eyes went off of Hugh and onto these girls.  And the girls were just saunting around like, would you like some water?  They should have had the girls wearing the MIFIs.  At least you would have seen them.  Yeah.  Because everyone was just gawking at these girls.  Very leggy.  They were wearing high heels.  Very leggy.  Very busty.  Blonde girls. 
[01:31:30]  Walking around.  You missed it, Jim.  I know.  Well, I went home and went to bed.  I had to.  We'll go to the press conference for one more place.  My picture won't be taken.  Aww.  Oh, Jimmy, our picture wasn't taken.  We were there just to support the company.  I supported it from home.  Hey, I hear things are good.  We did a little video thing for New York One.  We did?  Which is the cable news channel here in New York.  They did interview us.  Hysterical.  I was telling the guy, wow, you've got great placement.  Because when the power goes out and your cable dies and then it comes back on, always goes to New York One. 
[01:32:00]  There you go.  That's a plus.  That brings in the viewers.  Of course it will.  All right.  Where's Steve-O?  He's here.  He went to get himself a bagel.  Oh, he's here?  He's coming right back up, yeah.  He went to get himself a bagel?  What's he going to do with it?  I don't know.  Oh, eat it?  Did he bring any hooas?  He's just by himself.  Really?  Yeah.  That's how he's beat.  Oh, has he reached the point where he doesn't have a posse anymore?  No.  He's bigger than ever.  I think it's the fact that it's early morning. 
[01:32:30]  His posse probably goes to screw you.  He hasn't got a bed yet.  This is going to be great radio.  So, Spoon from Jersey, my favorite Steve-O quote from the old days with you guys are,  hey, you guys are cool.  We've been here for like two hours and you haven't called the cops yet.  And then he complained about the rest of the radio world tossing him bodily from their  studios.  All right.  Classic.  There you go.  Yeah.  Steve-O.  Well, we let Steve-O do his drugs.  We don't care.  We don't care.  Give us good radio.  You can do your drugs.  There you go.  We used to have people go into what we called Club Stinky and get stoned, but I think there 
[01:33:00]  was a little more going on than just a little pot smoking, to be quite honest with you.  Just a little bit.  I think that type of attitude and energy and whatever else he does, it's a little more  than just smoking a little of the weed.  That's what I think.  Jim, you need a flu shot?  No.  You look a little sickly today.  No, I'm just tired.  I'm going to sleep well.  The word peaked?  Peaked?  I don't feel sick at all.  I'm just tired.  You need a flu shot.  No, I don't. 
[01:33:30]  You should get online with all these old people out there and get a flu shot.  Oh, God.  The panic, the tizzy people are in about these goddamn flu shots.  You know what's hilarious about this flu shot thing?  Shortage?  You got all these old people that are at risk for getting the flu.  The high-risk people, Opie.  The children and the elderly.  And what are they doing?  They're standing out in the cold, because it's been unusually cold in the New York area  anyway, for hours upon hours hoping to get their flu shot.  Yeah, getting sick.  Going home empty-handed with the flu because they were stupid to stand outside in the cold. 
[01:34:00]  They're in a tizzy, though, about this, and the news channels are panicking people.  I've never had a flu shot.  Have you?  Have you ever gotten one?  I was going to get a flu shot this year.  You were going to?  And it would have been your first one?  Yeah, but I got the flu the day before we debuted this radio show.  So now I think I'm good.  I don't think I'm going to get the flu this year, because I do get it every year.  But it's not like Ebola.  It's not like you're going to liquefy your insides and they're going to come out of your 
[01:34:30]  mouth.  You get the flu, or you don't get it.  But if you get it, you take some days off of work.  It's kind of nice.  You lay in bed with your fever sack.  You watch Nickelodeon.  You watch a little Nickelodeon.  You take your NyQuil.  You reminisce about all the old TV shows you used to watch as a kid.  You sit there with your rolled up tissues all over the bed, blowing your nose.  Yeah, it's sort of like a little vacation.  Of course you have a little fever and you're all snotty and maybe your head hurts a little, 
[01:35:00]  but you get the good NyQuil buzz.  It's kind of...  I think people forget about the enjoyment of getting sick sometimes.  Sometimes it's kind of fun.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Jesus.  My sinuses are bugging me.  It's funny you're talking about this.  And so the intern was getting me.  I asked for some sinus medication.  Oh, no.  Stop.  Is that what...  What is it?  It's just some like, you know, the non-drowsy Tylenol sinus.  Tylenol extra strength.  It's just regular Tylenol.  It's what you take if you have your period. 
[01:35:30]  You wanted cold medicine.  Yeah.  And he got you something for a headache.  Yeah.  And they don't take refunds.  So I now have, after this money I just gave, a dollar.  That's what I have in your fucking pocket.  What happened?  I don't know.  I went to the Duane Reade, and he wanted a Tylenol sinus product, so I got him a Tylenol.  They didn't have a sinus product.  And Duane Reade, they didn't have any cold medication?  No, they had cold medication, just not the congestive thing.  I think he's being combative.  Yeah, I think so, too, because the pharmacy wouldn't have anything for your sinuses. 
[01:36:00]  That Tylenol doesn't make cold medicine.  Why don't you spill that hot coffee on him?  He messed up my aspirin order.  He got me Tylenol.  No, I need something for my stomach.  I can't.  I'm stuffy.  I don't have a headache.  Yeah.  Here you go, Jimmy.  We're going to go down and fix this.  No, I got the money.  I get money.  You sure?  Yeah, thanks.  I could fund your medication if you need it.  You only had a dollar.  No, that was after the second round of... 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  We've got to go to the phones.  This guy wants to defend LARPing from yesterday's show.  What's LARPing again?  Live action role-playing, Opie.  This is people that usually play Dungeons and Dragons, where you sit in the basement with  your little dice and a game board type thing and a dungeon master, and you role-play.  Well, LARPing is live action role-playing.  This is where you dress up like a knight, and you get together with your other friends that 
[01:37:00]  are dressed like various role-playing characters, and you have to slay a dragon or slay a big  mighty knight.  And instead of just doing it on a piece of paper with some dice, you do it live action.  You make the swords.  You hit people with swords.  From what I hear, if you're casting spells, you throw different colored beanbags at your  victim, and that represents your casting of the spells.  I'm actually LARPing right now.  Apparently, I'm dressed up like a guy who has a fucking headache and not a stuffed nose. 
[01:37:30]  Everyone is so angry today.  I love it.  This guy, you tell me, that isn't even trying.  And he knew I needed sinus medicine.  You know what this is?  That's passive-aggressive.  That's, well, it does say Tylenol.  Use this, scumbag.  He said Tylenol, and this says Tylenol, so I will get him this.  He's an intern.  He's trying.  I know he's trying.  He's not stupid.  He's a man.  He's an intern.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's really no excuse.  You knew it was for your sinus.  And I specified non-drowsy. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  I don't want to be tired during the Opie and Anthony program.  Why won't they take the Tylenol back?  Gee, I don't know.  There's never been a history of anything wrong with Tylenol.  So, yeah, you're probably right.  They should take it back.  No big deal.  I was grinding up something and putting it in here.  Do you guys want to put this back on the shelf?  It's got the safety seal.  I'm sure it does.  Yeah.  All right.  Todd from New Jersey.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I want to defend LARPing.  Yeah, I know.  Good luck.  We set you up already.  Let's go.  That web page came out saying lack of sex is 100%. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  I've had more sex at cons and at the games than I had in my entire life.  Cons are conventions open.  At the conventions?  Yes, I have.  With other LARPers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I'm sure they're quite the caliber of girl that you're finding at these conventions.  They're women that were LARPing and pretending to be water buffalo.  Oops.  If you want to find out, they're willing to come on the show.  Really?  What kind of women are following you guys around in this LARPing thing?  You get fat women that dress as Klingons. 
[01:39:00]  I've seen the films, sir.  No.  We got, uh...  I got one that's Puerto Rican, and she's about 5'2", weighs about 95 pounds with big hands.  Her specialty is flinging hubcaps at people's heads when they LARP.  Yeah, role-playing.  It's a lot of fun, because reality sometimes does suck.  Is she pretending to be married to a guy with one kid?  No.  She shoots newborns out of her vagina at the victim.  No, it's a lot of fun. 
[01:39:30]  Well, you really defended LARPing, I got to tell you, man.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun to be in someone's backyard dressed up in tinfoil night outfits.  We go to a state park and play this up at Sparta, New Jersey.  You know what's fun?  Doing lines off Reston.  Plants.  Exactly.  That's fun.  That's a riot.  Chasing it with whiskey.  That's what you call fun.  Why don't you guys all put on Nikes and go LARPing and pretending that Marshall Whiteapple is your boss,  and you're all going to meet the mothership as you gas yourselves in a room. 
[01:40:00]  Marshall Whiteapple.  Do you make your own stuff?  Do you have a sword?  What type of character are you?  I'm a human knight.  You're a human knight, so you don't have any magical powers?  No, I do not.  Todd, do you walk around as a knight at these conventions?  Yes, I do.  And girls want to talk to you and have sex with you?  We've been on Bravo.  We've been on, we just got posted in New York Times. 
[01:40:30]  New York Times came out last Friday.  There was an article on us.  We've been on MTV Plot.  So every weekend you go to another convention somewhere in the country?  Not every weekend.  The last one we did was down in Secaucus.  We did a role-playing convention.  That was about two weeks ago.  This March we're going back up to Secaucus.  There's a convention up there.  You know, I all of a sudden completely agree with the guy and see his point. 
[01:41:00]  Because it doesn't matter what you do in this world.  It doesn't matter how freakish, stupid, geeky, whatever it is you're into.  There are a collection of people that will be right there with you.  Guys and girls.  Their own little community.  And there will be sex that will happen between them.  And they're having a good time talking about this stuff with each other.  It doesn't matter what you do.  He's right.  He's right, Opie.  Okay, fine.  LARPers get as much pussy as everyone else.  All right.  Bang away there, Todd. 
[01:41:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Todd, do you have a little night hat that you wear at home?  No, I do not.  I only wear it on the field.  Of course.  How do you know if you're hitting somebody?  Sorry, Jim.  Did I step on you?  No, I was sucking boogers back.  When you feel a quarter-inch PVC puck going across your back, you know you got hit.  Oh, hey, tough guy.  Hey, calm down.  Whoa, easy.  Do you bruise easy?  No.  What do you call your sword?  A sword.  It doesn't have a special name or type of sword? 
[01:42:00]  Three-tart swords name is Charlene, sir.  No, you have one-handed edges, two-handed edges.  People do name their swords.  I have the sword of justice.  See, he's got the sword of justice, Opie.  The sword of justice?  There's a shield of justice.  The only justice would be if you fell on it and it went through your heart.  Oh, that stinks.  The sword of justice.  What an original name.  Are you a defender of the right?  I would go up to the studio and do this.  I would actually love to see a couple of them having a little battle, Opie. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, why don't you bring in some of your LARPer friends?  We could use some people on this show.  How many do you want?  Well, bring the hottest chick.  Yeah, bring the hottest girl LARPer you have.  17-year-old?  That's good.  Teen LARPing.  All of a sudden, LARPing sounds better.  Teen LARPing.  I like that.  Teen LARPing.  Yeah, we can handle the teen LARPing.  All right, you've got a bunch of you to come in, and you've got to dress in full LARPing gear. 
[01:43:00]  Regalia.  You got it.  Regalia.  Nice word, Anthony.  Bring the sword of justice with you, sir.  Bring your favorite garb, and come on in, and we'll check you out, okay?  When do you want it?  All right, we'll put you on hold and make arrangements.  Don't go anywhere.  All right.  All right, we're going to check out this LARPing for ourselves.  I just cannot wait to see the hottest LARPer.  He's on LARPer, Ben.  The hottest LARPing chick, I guarantee, is a four.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  At most.  I don't know.  We might be surprised.  But she's 17.  That kind of pushes her up.  Imagine if it's just some hot 17-year-old comes in here, and she's into LARPing. 
[01:43:30]  I will be the first one to fashion a crown out of tinfoil and say, I am the king.  You're the king LARPer.  I must fist you.  All right, we're going to step aside.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Steve-O was out filling out paperwork, and then Poe took...  This is an odd individual.  Master Poe has his camera.  You don't know who Steve-O is?  You don't know who Steve-O is?  I was ready to throw him up against the wall.  What is he doing?  He's just sleeping. 
[01:44:00]  He fell asleep out in the hall.  Oh, he's sleeping?  Oh, he's sleeping on the hall.  Is that really him just sleeping?  Him.  Sleeping.  Oh, my God.  That's good.  Poe is just out cold in the hallway near the elevator.  If you want to meet Steve-O, he's out cold outside the elevator on the fifth floor here.  You sure this guy doesn't have any weapons?  Master Poe almost killed him with his pinky.  He could do that, too.  Master Poe is not happy about Steve-O coming by to visit us.  The picture of Steve-O sleeping in the hall, it looks just like two guys I passed sleeping 
[01:44:30]  on the sidewalk on the way in.  No different.  It might even be one of the guys I saw sleeping on the sidewalk.  Is he really sleeping?  He's asleep.  I thought he was going downstairs for a bagel.  He did that, and then he came up and he went to sleep.  Oh.  Should we just have him sleep out there?  Actually, wait a second.  We could mic him.  We got to get that picture online.  That is a genuine passed out Steve-O.  Master Poe, yes.  He was filling out paperwork, and it took him about ten minutes to do this.  We have to redo the paperwork, because it looks like Cleon language. 
[01:45:00]  Really?  All right.  It's horrible.  He's old, yeah.  Master Poe does not like Steve-O.  I can tell.  How's his brainwaves?  He's a very famous guy, though.  That's good.  This could be his last appearance on a radio show.  You never know.  He's had enough of Steve-O's bunk.  Yeah, he's had it.  All right, why don't we take a break, and we'll get Steve-O in here.  If Steve-O's not busy, though, maybe I can send him out for some sinus medication.  All right.  Come back with a kilo of cocaine.  That's what he'll do.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  It was whip him out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I was listening to some rap music this afternoon.  Not that I had a choice.  It was coming out of a Jeep four miles away. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, can you turn that crap up?  I still have one eyeball left in the socket.  It's good music.  It has a message.  Kill Whitey!  And white people are dancing to it.  I love this song.  It mentions my name twice.  I like rap, man.  I don't care when they mess with a turntable.  Sounds like a fat chick walking in corduroys.  Please welcome MC Chafe. 
[01:46:30]  Remember, they call rap, they call scratching an art form.  Remember the old days?  You're at a party.  You bumped into the turntable.  You're an asshole.  Now you're a musical genius.  Is he drunk?  No, he's cutting an album.  F**k!  F**k!  F**k!  Get away from the turntable, Bill.  F**k you, I'm good.  Give me a contract. 
[01:47:00]  Now rappers are shooting each other, huh?  Finally.  If we could just get the country and western people to join in,  it'll be a perfect world.  I'd hate to see Billy Ray Cyrus take a cap in the achy, breaky ass.  Huh?  That would suck.  Boy, we wouldn't want to lose that talent, would we? 
[01:47:30]  Rap is a-shooting each other.  It's getting crazy over music, man.  Remember the old days?  There was a shooting.  Cops used to look through mug photos.  Now they look through the R&B section in Tower Records.  So, uh, what's-  I need a vacation.  Obviously, I'm a tad stressed, and, uh...  You're driving.  This is your daily commute.  You tune in your XM radio. 
[01:48:00]  You pay little attention, if any, to the road.  You're approaching the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  Suddenly, for no apparent reason, you pull the wheel strongly to the right.  Your car is pole vaulted into the air.  Gravity takes a hold, and you head to the water.  The impact is like concrete.  Then you slowly submerge. 
[01:48:30]  Feeling the cold presence of wetness, oxygen is slowly purged from your vehicle.  And for a moment, you think to yourself,  Man, my XM radio sounds so good.  Man.  BONEYARD!  Hey, have you checked out the Boneyard yet?  XM 4-1.  80s-based hard rockin' hair bands.  Kiss.  Judas Priest. 
[01:49:00]  Van Halen.  ACDC.  Metallica.  Rush.  Scorpions.  Plus all the 80s hair bands.  Motley Crue.  Warren.  Dockin'.  Whitesnake.  Rack.  Bon Jovi.  Not just the hits, but the artist's full careers.  Mix it all together with a slightly bent and irreverent attitude,  and you have to Boneyard.  For 80s-based hard rock, check out XM 4-1.  Go Boneyard.  BONE BAY!  Back in the 1950s,  all those baby boomers were finally big enough to grab the radio dial.  And this is what they wanted to hear. 
[01:49:30]  BABABALOOMABALABAMBOO!  Tune it to it.  Gonna kung fu it and get down to it.  This is Matt the Cat, where it's at.  Feeling all right.  Via satellite, baby.  Hello, baby.  Go!  So grab that dial and put it on the 50s on 5.  50s on 5!  Radio to the power of X.  The 50s on 5 on XM5.  Prepare to be wowed. 
[01:50:00]  What mockers.  With him out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  And we're back with the O.B. Anthony show.  Turn down the music.  Anthony's playing GTA live on our program.  San Andreas.  Wow, you got out of that mess, Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  Here, have Steve-O.  Actually, Steve-O's still passed down the hall, but I think we just woke him up.  Get somebody in here to play Grand Theft Auto while we talk and get this show on the road here.  Oh, the cop almost got me out of the car.  Get the hell out of there, Anthony.  Oh, I just ran the cop off.  Oh, nice.  Ran over two cops.  He's back on the road.  He's rocking.  Knocking over the telephone poles.  There's the cop.  Oh, I am in trouble. 
[01:51:00]  Oh!  Oh, I just ran over a hooker.  Just ran over a hooker.  All right, get the hell out.  Dude, beat the hell out of the cops.  All right, here you go.  He's out of the car.  He has no weapons.  Punch that guy.  Oh, they're shooting at you, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh!  Wasted.  I am one dead brother laying in the street.  Yeah, you can play this on your computer or on a... 
[01:51:30]  No, this is just PlayStation.  For now.  They said in, like, July they're going to have a PC version.  Which would you prefer?  PC.  Why is that better?  First of all, I'm not a big PlayStation controller guy.  I'd rather have the mouse and keyboard.  Because I always get confused with these damn controllers.  They never make sense.  I'm going to have to get all re-acclimated to PlayStation controllers.  Anthony, this show is just getting worse and worse, by the way.  I can't tell if it's the game or Steve-O.  Now, Steve-O was passed out near the elevators. 
[01:52:00]  We were able to get him inside the XM facility, but now he's passed out right outside the studio, right?  Is he on the floor?  Fast asleep on the floor.  He is fast asleep.  America, asshole.  I'm an asshole.  All right.  Well...  This looks really fun.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's just shooting everybody.  We got Steve from foundrymusic.com is just blowing away the homies as he's running down the street.  Nice.  Oh, you're shooting homies in the back.  You're so calm.  All right.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, you got the cops. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  What's with the glowing stuff on them?  That's like a targeting thing, I think.  Here, stop him.  Get ready to get creamed, asshole.  Yeah, this dude is...  Hey, Steve-O.  Yeah, dude.  You're up, man.  This dude is a bad mother effer.  I'll kill you.  You hear me?  All right.  It's you and the cop now.  Dude, don't run away from the cop.  Take it to him.  You don't have a weapon?  Take it to him.  Right there.  Take it to him.  You got scraps, son.  Oh, nice.  Nice left hook.  You got scraps, son.  Yeah.  Oh, you're kicking his ass, Steve. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, he's down.  Stomp him.  He just stomped the cop.  Cops back up.  Oh, yeah.  Is this what you guys call radio?  Yeah, we play video games.  I'm not even in this video game, man.  This is total bull.  Oh, you're dead.  You're so dead.  Now you're gone.  No, he's still happening.  Oh, he's...  He got on the cop's motorcycle.  Oh, he just hit a pole.  Come on, Steve.  Come on, Steve.  Get on the road.  Here we go.  What are you doing?  All right. 
[01:53:30]  He's getting the hell out of there.  He's hitting walls.  You're not too good on the motorcycle, are you?  So far, he's outrunning the cop, though.  How many...  He's got two stars out of six, so the cops are kind of after him.  Okay, you guys really have mellowed out since I saw you last.  Yeah.  You have no idea.  This is what we do.  We just watch video games.  Yeah, we do the play-by-play.  We do play-by-play of video games.  That's what the show is all about.  What about these video games I'm in, man? 
[01:54:00]  Why don't you play my video games?  Yeah, which one do you got?  I'm in Tony Hawk Underground 2.  Right.  ESPN NFL 2005.  Yeah, but do you get to kill anyone during the Tony Hawk game?  There's no crowbars over the head.  Get to kill you?  I do.  I know.  The skateboarding video games are kind of like, you know, I need more blood.  I shouldn't say it, but I don't play any video games.  I need more bloodshed.  Your life is a video game.  What the hell do you need video games for?  Yeah.  You're a live-action game.  All right.  The homie's off the bike.  As soon as he gets killed, then we'll say hi to Steve-O. 
[01:54:30]  Man, he's taking the cops out still.  Oh, you're done.  Oh, you're so done.  Nightstick against the gun.  Oh, the cop's taking you out.  Oh, he knocks that cop out.  I don't think this game is going to do anything for racial harmony.  No, not at all.  All the cops are white, and all the bad guys are black guys.  What's the name of this game?  Accurate?  All right.  The homie stole the cop car.  Jesus.  Now there's three stars. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, you're up to three.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  He's not going to get out of this one.  Not at all, man.  All right.  He's tooling down the road in the cop car.  Oh, head on with another cop.  Head on with another cop.  His car's smoking.  It's looking really grim.  He just ran over a cop.  Oh, they got the helicopter cops out now.  You are so done.  Oh, they got him in a corner.  His car's on fire.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out of the vehicle.  All right.  The homie's running around.  Oh, nice.  He got out of it.  I think he killed about five cops when the car exploded.  All right.  He's running down.  Oh, you got a shotgun?  Oh, you're so done. 
[01:55:30]  They got the helicopters in the sky.  You got a shotgun, though.  That's pretty good.  Oh, wasted.  You're dead.  So far, so good.  I'm digging the new GTA San Andreas.  He was doing pretty good.  Very good, Steve.  Hey, Steve-o.  What's up, buddy?  Chilling, man.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  We're rocking here on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, I think this is my first time ever on satellite radio.  Really?  I'm completely ignorant.  Do we have no commercials whatsoever?  You can do whatever you want.  Yeah, yeah.  Really? 
[01:56:00]  You got no limits.  Know what you should do?  You should get the cursing out of the way first, because the first show, we just-  We're allowed to say shit and fuck?  Yeah, you just curse, get that out of the way, and then we do the fun stuff.  Isn't that amazing?  I was going to say, it's not like when I used to visit you guys that I had a lot of limits.  Yeah, I know.  You really didn't have any limits then anyway, so it's pretty much the same.  Speaking of which, anybody got any grass?  No.  No one's got any pot?  Where's your peeps?  Yeah, what happened, man?  I don't know, man. 
[01:56:30]  I flew from Los Angeles, and I stepped off an airplane like an hour ago.  Really?  Yeah, I was looking for someone holding a sign that said Stevo or something, but knowing my  crackpot management, it's just-  Nothing?  Yeah.  Usually, I remember when you came in on the other show, though, you had a lot of people  with you.  Yeah.  They were like videotaping stuff, and then you had Dee with you.  Yeah.  How's Dee?  You know, Dee fell off the place of the planet, dude.  We haven't heard from her.  Really?  All right.  You moved on from Dee?  Yeah, but I made it through a physical months after. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  A real point of concern.  You didn't have the hiv?  Yeah, no.  That was the one I got away with.  With everything he does, that's the thing he's worried about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting the hiv.  You all clean?  You checked out clean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I cleared for life insurance.  I was in a really shady mood when my lawyer took life insurance out on me.  Oh!  What a smart move, man.  Yeah.  The lawyer's thinking ahead.  That's a sure thing, just waiting to come in.  Absolutely. 
[01:57:30]  That's better than playing the stock market.  They came up with a $3 million policy on my life, man.  You know what the premiums must be on insurance for Steve-O?  Yeah, but I don't know.  They brought me in for some special meeting and sat down with an insurance consultant, and  we filled out all the paperwork accurately, but, you know.  Are there things that they say you can't do now?  We called me a performer in the, like, that I was in, that I performed physical comedy.  Oh, is that what they call it? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't lie, but, uh.  Physical comedy?  Yeah.  Swimming in a river with fucking bears?  With trout on you?  Man, this is going to be weird to, like, just swear on my program not to swear on the radio.  I know, it's going to be great when you go on regular radio now and you're cursing all  the time, you know?  No way, what happens?  This desensitizes everybody.  Why do you have shit and fuck on you?  That's not doing that.  I do, yeah.  I see the new tattoos.  They're tats?  Oh, my God, I got a bunch of tattoos.  Oh, yeah, those are, that's, uh, tats.  Those are tats? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, they're like prison tattoos, man.  They're on his knuckles.  One says shit, one says fuck.  Oh, we see.  I got a big dick on my arm.  Wait, let me see that shit.  He's got a, you got a tattoo of a big dick on your arm.  He's got a leaky penis on his bicep.  Yeah.  Why, Steve-o, why?  I don't know, man.  Like, where's the, that's hilarious, man.  I decided to shouldn't.  Let me see the famous one from the Jackass movie.  Oh, yeah, what are you kidding?  Yeah, he's got his portrait on the back.  There's that one, the portrait, but I want to see the one, the smile, the happy face that  you got in the, uh, Hummer. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, there's the, the Hummer tattoo.  I'm chilling, I got shit fuck on my knuckles.  I got a pot leaf on my one wrist, upside down pentagram on the other.  I just carved an upside down cross into my shoulder.  That shit fuck on your knuckles pretty much guarantees you'll be doing what you're doing  now for the rest of your life.  There's no other career choices you can make.  There's no branching off to maybe the executive sector of IBM or something.  Yeah, but when I become, when I become a, uh, a parent.  Yeah, what are you going to do there?  Well, no, I'm going to, I'm going to take the T and change it into a P. 
[01:59:30]  Ship?  Ship, and then, uh.  Truck?  The U, the U turns into an O and says, so ship, book.  You're a sailor in doo-doo?  Ship, book.  Yeah, to promote nautical literature.  At least he's thinking how to get rid of it.  My uncle's a gay sailor in the Navy, so.  Ship, book.  I like it.  That's thinking.  I don't think my uncle's really gay.  Dude, he's, he's the real deal, though, man.  Who puts a leaky penis on their face?  Yeah, what was that about?  Yeah, you didn't just decide to do that. 
[02:00:00]  But that had to be a bet gone wrong or something.  Nah, um, I was in this relationship, uh, I was in a relationship with a girl that I was  really trying to make work, and it wasn't going to work, so I tattooed myself in every  way I could, I could think of.  Wait, that, that was done out of, like, being pissed off?  Yeah, I was, I was like, yeah.  You were mad at yourself?  I wasn't mad at myself.  I was, I was, I was, I was trying to get out of this young girl's life before I ruined  it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  How old was she, Steve?  A real sweetheart.  Well, she, she's almost 21. 
[02:00:30]  That's the ultimate father nightmare, is bringing Steve-O home.  You're 21 years old.  Daddy, here's my new boyfriend.  Damn.  Nice dick tattoo.  Yeah.  I've got a, I got a new girlfriend now, and I just went to go visit her, visit her mom  in Denmark, and her, her mom just loves my tattoo.  Really?  Yeah.  They love the shit and the fuck, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  And of course, in that, there's no father in that, uh, family, right?  Um.  He left many years ago after, he did the old touch and run, did he? 
[02:01:00]  Nah, I, I, I'm not, I'm not sure what the circumstances are, but it's a great family,  and my girlfriend's very wonderful.  She's a big time, famous model.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  He's getting, he's getting the pooh-ha, man.  Really famous?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's brag about my girlfriend.  Well, who is she?  Can we see pictures of her?  Um, yeah, you guys, instead of playing damn video games, you should Google her.  Her name's, uh, Mae Anderson.  Oh, oh.  Anderson with an E-N.  I will definitely Google her. 
[02:01:30]  Anderson with an E-N.  Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model, a sports officer, a swimsuit edition, spokesmodel  for Wonderbra.  I gotta see now.  Yeah, bring her up, dude.  You've got me intrigued.  There's a lot of people that think I'm a little bit fruity.  You know, some of the things you do, man.  Yeah, but maybe when you're watching the show, but we've hung with you many times.  You're, you're far from that.  I'm wild, boys.  You always bring the hottest chicks around.  Some of the stuff you do with Chris is not only hysterically funny, but so gay. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Like, it's not even, some of the stuff you do isn't even like, wow, that's funny that  two heterosexual guys are doing something so gay.  It's like, you have to be gay to do that.  It's like, so incredibly gay.  I mean, the way we see it, we act so gay that, I mean, it's obvious that we're straight.  Oh, yeah.  It's just so over the top.  You couldn't be that gay and be gay.  Yeah.  So what's taking so long, man?  My girl's all over the internet. 
[02:02:30]  Holy man.  You might be going out with the hottest girl in the world.  Yeah, dude.  Wow.  Come on.  What?  What are you, insane?  Thank God she's not awake yet.  If you want to play along at home, just Google May Anderson, E-N at the end, and look what  Steve-O is banging.  Oh, my goodness.  You see this, Jim?  She's unbelievable.  She really is unbelievable.  How tall is she?  She's taller than you, though, right?  That's always a little weird, no?  I think, I don't know, I'm 5'11 and three quarters, and she might have me by a 
[02:03:00]  quarter inch or so.  Wow.  But then the heels really ruin it for me.  Oh, my God.  Just Google her name, and you get like a bunch of pictures of her.  Yeah, May Anderson.  How did you hook up with her?  Johnny Knoxville introduced me to her.  He was done with her in Hollywood Johnny Knoxville?  You know what I think?  I don't know.  I guess, like, once she figured out that I'm not exactly the way I portray myself on TV, 
[02:03:30]  I think.  You're not?  You mean you're not gay?  Guy comes in, fell asleep in the hallway.  I don't want to say that, like I portrayed a false image.  No.  But, you know, I don't know.  I don't know how the hell I got her.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  But, man, you must really work hard at keeping this girl, right?  Oh, dude, yeah.  Like, you just know one fuck-up, and it's over, Johnny. 
[02:04:00]  She is gone.  You're calling her every ten minutes, making sure she's with no one else.  God, I hate to admit it.  But, yeah, I'm going to fall with her all down.  Do people just wince when you walk by arm-in-arm?  Do they just get angry?  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of the time, yeah.  Oh, my God.  You look at that and go, like, and it's live, and he just goes into bed with her.  Wow.  This interview is awesome.  That's a great start.  That is amazing. 
[02:04:30]  You've definitely upgraded since the last time we saw you.  Although, Dee was quite fine in her own room.  Yeah, but she was completely insane.  So, what has nine arms and totally sucks?  What?  Def Leppard.  Yeah.  That would even be funnier if it was 1996.  I think that would have been pretty hot in 86.  Yeah, true.  He's doing great radio considering he was just passed out two minutes ago.  I know.  He snaps right to it.  I know.  That's the story.  You were sleeping near the elevator. 
[02:05:00]  That was good.  You were out cold, bro.  I know, man.  When was the last time you went to bed?  I slept a little bit on the airplane.  That's it.  And I had a middle seat.  You know?  Middle seat on JetBlue.  But I took enough Xanax.  I didn't care.  Do the people recognize you that are sitting next to you?  Yeah.  It's kind of funny.  A lot of people are like, oh, what are you doing?  Way back here in code.  So, let me live in the middle.  It's like, hey, we're doing a plane crash gag today.  And just scare the crap out of everyone on the plane.  I joined the Al-Qaeda. 
[02:05:30]  It's going to be great.  It's a goof for MTV.  Yeah.  I love Wild Boys.  The show's hysterical.  Hey, thank you, man.  Thank you.  And they send you, like, I'm amazed at the place they send you.  Because I didn't think MTV had any money.  I know.  How did they even send you to those places?  I mean, I guess that's probably why they don't pay me that much.  Australia.  You've got to get all kinds of shots and everything, right?  Yeah, I'm three shots away from being vaccinated from rabies for life.  Really?  Yeah, so I can get attacked by any animal I want. 
[02:06:00]  That is cool.  I don't know.  You must get, like, a mean case of the runs, though, and stuff.  Time to time.  But that's mostly from the drugs and the booze.  Not the food or the water?  You know, I make a point of drinking tap water on every continent.  You do?  You just drink the water that's coming out of whatever?  Yeah.  You know, I firmly believe it doesn't kill you.  It makes you stronger.  Yeah.  Gets your resistance up.  Every new country I go to, like, I like to drink the tap water.  And I think that I'm a really healthy person for it. 
[02:06:30]  You probably are, man.  You know, if you drink purified water all day, every day, dude, then...  Any little thing's going to get you.  Exactly.  It's like living in an incubator.  As soon as you get out of there, you're done.  And you're getting bitten.  What's, like, the scariest thing you've been bitten by on this show?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have...  I have...  I have...  I have...  I have...  I have...  Well, no, I just recently shot this commercial for Nintendo.  And it turned out to be the most dangerous situation I've ever been in my life.  Like, they had...  It says Nintendo's got this new product coming out that wirelessly... 
[02:07:00]  Like, you can play against your buddies, like, wirelessly, you know, whatever.  It's like sort of a cell phone.  And so, you know, we've got this scene, and I'm up in this tree, and, you know, I'm playing  against Chris.  He's charging around on this big elephant.  And, you know, they've got chicken tied to the tree, the tree branch I'm on.  So there's these three huge African lions, like, you know, jumping up to try and get the  meat.  And I'm sitting on this branch, you know, like, and I tell them, I go, why? 
[02:07:30]  You know, what is going to stop these fucking lions?  I love saying fuck.  What's going to stop these fucking lions from just climbing up the tree and killing them?  And killing you, dragging you off by the throat.  And they're like, oh, don't worry, dude, lions can't climb trees, dude, you know?  Like, lions don't climb trees.  So I'm just thinking...  And then our director says, yeah, but that is a pretty mellow tree.  So there I am.  I'm out on this branch.  It's like 10 feet above the ground.  Take one, you know, drop the slate, and then the lion bolts straight up the goddamn tree, 
[02:08:00]  dude.  Like, complete pandemonium.  It comes out and just, like, pins me down to this branch, like...  Get out of here, holy shit.  I can show you on my computer, man.  Like, I have this contraband that I'm not supposed to have, like, this footage of the...  Oh, I definitely want to see that, yeah.  Yeah, we're going on...  And we're going to play the clip on Jay Leno, too, this coming November 5th.  Do you realize, when I watch the show, and I know a lot of people think this, when I watch  it, do you realize people are watching this going, one of these guys, if not both, are 
[02:08:30]  going to die during doing this show?  We're going to cross out the Z and continue on as a wild boy.  Because it's really dangerous.  I mean, it's not even a set-up thing.  It's not like the old Wild Kingdom, where Marlon Perkins would be in a blind somewhere,  and, you know, they'd show this footage from miles away.  Which is another thing, I think, is hysterical.  You look at old nature shows, and you realize what it's evolved into is this guy and Chris  going out and almost getting killed by these animals. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Have you turned anything down?  Yeah, there's been some things, yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, and overall, jackass, we were putting ourselves at risk of, you know, bumps and  bruises, and it's just straight-up shit that can kill you now.  But this is putting yourself at risk that, yeah, these things can kill you.  Yeah.  Well, you guys went in the water with the bear.  Yeah.  And that big...  And that was really sketchy.  That was really kind of scary.  There was the time when we jumped off the boat.  And, you know, I should mention, too, that actually, yesterday, out in the stores came 
[02:09:30]  out our Wild Boys complete first season DVD.  Oh.  Nice.  Got to pick that up.  And if you thought the show was gay...  Wait till you watch the extras.  There's full anal intercourse.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And how about a moment of silence for Chris Bonnius?  We just had his bachelor party.  Oh, he's getting married?  He's getting married.  Yeah, he's getting married this Friday.  To Steve-O.  You know what?  In San Francisco.  Well, no, in Massachusetts is where it's legal.  So I told him, when I first heard about it, I said, Chris, you know, like, we need 
[02:10:00]  to go to Massachusetts and get married with a prenup.  And then we need to go to Utah, and then you can start adding spouses.  If you expect any silence at your wedding out of me.  So he's getting married, and it is a lovely young lady?  She is, yeah.  She's a lovely Irish lass.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See, now that's somebody, I would assume, was completely gay.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, no.  Based on his character.  Yeah, no, Chris really isn't gay at all, either.  And even though I think the marriage, you know, like, whether or not I'm a dick for saying 
[02:10:30]  it, I think the marriage has a lot to do with getting his Irish lass a green card.  Oh, she's, like, right from Ireland?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, so it could be, like, a set-up.  Kind of one hand-watched to the other.  She gets a green card, he gets a beard.  So it doesn't look so gay.  You could say, you know, look, I can't be gay, I'm married to a lovely young lady.  Yeah, no, that's his term.  But the bachelor party was very interesting on Monday night.  Old Knoxville couldn't make it, so he sent us some strippers. 
[02:11:00]  Filming another movie, is he?  Yeah.  That guy has probably the best agent ever, ever.  The guy turns up in everything.  He's on fire, yeah.  I think he's up to, like, five million a movie now.  Really?  Yeah.  But, you know, like, all he ever wanted in the beginning was to be an actor, you know.  It was a means to an end, which he called out.  And nobody can call him a hypocrite or a sellout, because...  No, the guy took a lot of pain to get where he is.  He did exactly what he intended to do.  That beanbag gun that was shot at his abdomen.  I know.  Oh, man. 
[02:11:30]  What's he going to get shot with next?  Well, he got shot for real, but they never showed it on MTV.  What?  Yeah, right?  He put on a bulletproof vest.  Oh, the bulletproof vest.  Where is that video?  Can you see that anywhere?  Does he have that now?  He got shot in the desert with a bulletproof vest on, but MTV refused to show it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that was a video that was put out by Larry Flint Publications.  Oh, there you go.  So it is out there somewhere.  It's out there, but they didn't license any of the damn music for it.  Oh, really? 
[02:12:00]  So should they want to do anything with it, you know, it's just like one lawsuit after another.  Great.  I mean, I'm glad I'm on the radio, Brian, telling Brian about that.  Yeah, fuck you, Larry.  What's he going to do?  So anyway, Knoxville sent some strippers to Chris's bachelor party, and they were dudes.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and just to make it worse, they were wearing all this crazy bondage gear and giving each 
[02:12:30]  other blowjobs in the middle of the party.  Great party.  Wow.  Great party, isn't it?  Yeah, like, honest to God, I think it's the only bachelor party in the history of the world  that the bride wasn't concerned about.  You know, like, it was the stuff.  Gay sex going on at the bachelor party.  It was the first time I've ever actually seen a dude give another dude a blowjob.  Oh.  Yeah, that can't be much of a treat to watch.  Well, I don't know.  Guy pulls away, and he's got that razor burn on his testicles. 
[02:13:00]  I was posing for all kinds of pictures, like, right kind of in the scene, too.  I didn't care.  Of course not.  Dude, I saw something.  You were on John McEnroe's show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're actually taping John McEnroe today.  I think they're bringing in a film crew, right?  In a little while?  Are they?  Because you're going to do some stunts.  Maybe you...  Yeah, I came totally unprepared, and I walked straight off an airplane in here.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  You usually do.  Remember the thing we set up at the old station where he jumped over the console? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that knocked off the on-air sign.  Yeah, yeah.  He broke the place.  Yeah, that was a brilliant laugh.  But he was on John McEnroe a couple weeks ago, and he let Johnny Mac serve into his body.  Served tennis balls at him, yeah.  Wow, that must have hurt.  The wealth you had were ridiculous.  I told him that I wasn't too afraid because he was well over the hill.  Dude, you had pissed him off, man.  John McEnroe didn't hold back at all.  The wealth he had at the end of the show were crazy. 
[02:14:00]  How fast do you think he served?  I don't know, man, but...  They were up there.  Yeah, no, yeah.  He took one just off the testicle.  I know.  Upper thigh.  How far away were you?  I don't know.  Max 30 feet.  Yeah, 30 feet probably.  And he's connecting like that?  He's still got his aim, huh?  Pretty much full serve.  Pretty much full serve.  Still able to aim, though, and get hit?  I was wearing a cup, and I told him to aim for it, but he kept getting me in the thighs.  I think he took like three shots, something like that.  I know, yeah.  And then he finally goes, that's it.  Yeah, I kind of ran out of the scene.  He got him on the soft spot on the upper thigh. 
[02:14:30]  He's like, that's it.  I'm done.  Well, yeah.  That was pretty crazy.  You ever play asses up handball years ago?  In the old days, sure.  And then you try to get the ball to bounce off the wall and back into his nuts.  Dude, you try to hit him in the ass.  Is that cool in front of this guy?  No, I'm just saying that's what you're doing.  That would hurt.  Did I perform the butt chug on the show with you guys one time?  Oh, yes, you did the butt chug.  He did do the butt chug?  Of course he did.  Yeah, I took a funnel with the hose and I put it in my butt.  Beer in his butt? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, and then I tried to fart beer in my mouth.  Yeah.  I really don't know how to outdo that, dude.  Yeah, how do you talk something like that?  I don't know.  We got to show off for Steve-O today.  We got to get a couple to have sex for him.  Oh, my God.  That's what happened to you guys.  You guys solicited pretty serious crimes to occur in churches.  Crimes to the church.  Crimes to humanity.  You kind of heard about our little story?  I was just, I was prouder than I could be.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  At the end of the day, you know, or at the end of that day, I guess, I really thought that,  you know, that it would all work out for the better.  And I guess now it ultimately has, but.  Yeah, but it was two years of two years.  Was it two years?  We haven't seen you in like two, two and a half years.  It was two years of exile, just doing nothing, trying to, just X-ing off the days on the  calendar.  That's pretty, because, you know, I really thought that overnight that that would turn  into the best thing that ever happened to you, but.  Eventually, it will be the best thing that happened to us.  Yeah, eventually. 
[02:16:00]  We're still eking it out.  It definitely made us a little bigger, but.  That's funny.  Yeah.  And in that time, I've been arrested for international drug smuggling.  Have you?  Yeah.  Drug smuggling.  Yeah, it was amazing.  And what happened there?  Were you a mule?  No, I, well, no, it was really only for the, for the purposes of filming one of my DVDs.  Like, I was in Norway, and, you know, we're getting ready to go to the airport to fly to  Sweden, and I had all this hash and.  Did you tape it to your body?  No, no, even better, even better. 
[02:16:30]  End up in a Turkish prison.  I took a condom, and I put all this marijuana and hash in the condom, and I tied it up in  a knot, and swallowed it.  And it was really, it was such an ambitious, like, such an ambitious package to swallow.  Really?  Was it kind of big?  It choked on it.  It got stuck in my throat.  How the hell do you swallow something like that?  Yeah, it got stuck in my throat, and it was choked on it.  I was puking up blood trying to get it out.  Did you just think, oh, my God, if I die doing this, like, as you're doing it, like,  oh, no, they're going to, Steve-O found with hash and pot, and he's stuck in his throat 
[02:17:00]  in a condom.  And, yeah, swallowed it down, because you remember when I was the, you know, I came in, I was  promoting my first video, and there was the dog ate the condom, and then.  Yeah.  So I figured if a dog can do it, then so can I, you know, and so I swallowed this condom  for a pot and a hash, and it took seven days for me to finally crap it out, because I was  just, it was my vision, you know, I crap it out, and then, you know, open it up.  It was his vision.  My vision, yeah.  Did every crap, you went picking through it, and went, no, nothing. 
[02:17:30]  I filmed it, too.  Like a prospector.  I filmed it, too, and, you know, my whole idea, like, the punchline is, you know, like,  finally I take the pot out, you know, and, you know, roll a joint or whatever, and  I smoke, and, now that's good shit, you know, like.  And I was all excited about it, and over the six days I spent touring Sweden, I bragged  to the media, every newspaper, every TV show, like, how are you doing?  Well, I think I might die of intestinal strangulation, because I've got all this marijuana in my 
[02:18:00]  body, you know, like, and where it turns out Sweden has, like, the strictest drug laws  in Europe.  Really?  So, yeah, so.  Who knew that?  Right after I pooped it out and got my punchline, I was so happy.  Then, the next morning, I got ambushed by undercover cops leaving the Swedish hotel, and I spent  five days in Swedish prison.  How is Swedish prison?  It's really pretty mellow, man.  It sounds kind of nice.  You're in a Swedish prison.  I know.  They give you cocoa with marshmallows in it.  I mean, I was able to smoke cigarettes, and then, you know, I could even, like, they 
[02:18:30]  took me to buy junk food, and cigarettes just puffing away, and, I mean, granted, I had  to poop into plastic bags in front of dudes for five days in a row.  Oh, they wanted to see what else you had in there?  Yeah, because they weren't entirely convinced that they'd come out.  What a crap job they have.  I know, and I was making fun of them, too, for doing my job.  Taking through crap, you know.  Oh, really?  But, yeah, and I had that, and then I also had, for a while, I was facing eight years  in prison on two felony charges out of Louisiana, stemming from stapling my scrotum to my thigh. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, I read about that.  We read about that one.  Yeah, that was big, big trouble.  What was that, an obscene?  Yeah, it was another case of obscenity, which, you know, I mean, I'll go ahead and call myself  a celebrity, and that's so funny.  But, like, the truth is no celebrities have ever been convicted of obscenity.  No, no.  Like Jim Morrison, Larry Flint, Marilyn Manson, two live crew, Lenny Bruce, yeah.  The list just goes on and on, and so, yeah, I'm really proud. 
[02:19:30]  Like, I feel like stapling my balls to my leg really let me join this group of American heroes.  But you were in a club?  Yeah, I was in a club, yeah.  So the people in the club knew what they were getting.  Yeah, it was an audience.  When, like, you walked into a restaurant in front of a family and started doing it.  And there was an isolated incident that had nothing to do with me with, you know, a bouncer's  injuring an audience member, which kind of brought all the attention to it.  So they threw the book at me for obscenity. 
[02:20:00]  Is this your mugshot?  Yeah, check out how bummed I am.  Oh, man, you look bummed.  I was in so much trouble, dude.  I don't care.  Yeah, we got the arrest report here.  Anybody can make fun of me as well.  Jackass star Steve-O, a.k.a. Stephen Glover, was arrested in August 2002.  That was when we got screwed over.  Oh, look at that.  What day was it, man?  Do you know offhand?  I was arrested, I think it was, like, August 1st or something.  Oh, okay.  We destroyed our lives on August 16th.  If you're playing along at home.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Actually, the 15th.  I had, you know, I was really in a lot of trouble.  And ultimately, the courts, you know, like, I guess the judge reviewed the tape of my performance.  And it came down, it was the court decision that stapling your balls to your leg is an act of art.  There you go.  So, yeah, so.  Anything is an act of art and it's protected if you do it.  That's amazing.  I know, I know.  Like, I'm glad the state of Louisiana really considers me to be this artist.  Louisiana. 
[02:21:00]  Were there cops in the place?  No, no, no, no.  I got arrested on a fugitive warrant two weeks later.  How did that happen?  It was because an audience member had been videotaping it and they thought, wow, that was messed up.  And they sent the tape to the news, which thought, wow, that's probably pretty illegal.  That's probably pretty illegal.  Yeah, then the news sent it to the cops.  And then, you know, it was two weeks later.  I was back in Los Angeles when they issued the warrant.  So, what, did they extradite you?  Yeah, oh, my God.  You're not even going to believe me, but I literally got arrested with a $1.12 million bail. 
[02:21:30]  Are you kidding me?  No, because the state of Louisiana, you know, and it was a case of the district attorney was running for a district judge, I guess.  And it was all like.  How did they justify it?  Because they're saying I was a flight risk because I was no longer in the state.  So, there was this principle to second degree battery charge for what the bouncers did.  And they gave me a principle to that.  Like, I was somehow an accessory to that.  And with that charge came a $120,000 bail. 
[02:22:00]  And then separately, just for the one stapled through my ball bag, I got a full million.  The million dollar stable.  Yeah.  A million dollar bail.  They don't give that to some people that kill people.  No, I know.  I don't think the Robert Blake.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he only had a million.  And I didn't, you know, I had no way of posing that kind of bail.  You can't post that kind of bond.  So, yeah.  So, I was sitting on Robert Downey Jr. block in L.A. County Jail for five days. 
[02:22:30]  Five days you had to sit there because they had a million dollar bond.  Yeah, and, you know, we had to wait to get me in front of a judge to, you know, have a bail reduction hearing to say, look, you know, this guy's not a flight risk.  He can't hide anywhere.  Yeah, you know.  Can't hide, yeah.  Yeah, so.  He's got a penis tattoo on his arm, for God's sake.  How are you going to miss this guy?  Yeah, so we got it on.  That's not the type of tattoo you want if you're in the joint.  Yeah.  You might want to cover that up if you're going to be in the joint.  Yeah.  You want a matching one in your mouth, son? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, sure.  But, yeah, we got it down.  We got it knocked down to $150,000.  Oh, man.  And my accountant put that up.  He should have just been released on his own recognizance.  What justifies any bail when all you've done is put a staple through your sack?  I know.  I know.  God damn.  And I'm not sure if I can get girls pregnant after all the staples that have been through my ball sack.  But I can damn well fuck them. 
[02:23:30]  Good.  You don't want to ruin that girl's body with a baby.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, what's up with this new DVD?  I'm so proud of it, man.  It's called Steve-O the Early Years.  Oh.  And it's...  How dangerous and irresponsible behavior can lead to fame and fortune.  Yeah.  There you go, kids.  You're teaching them.  Yeah.  It's basically a how-to video.  Like, I would take a video camera and, like, piss a lot of people off.  I mean, I don't know.  I like to describe it as a two-hopper TV A&E biography about the rise to shame. 
[02:24:00]  Nice.  It's called The Rise.  The Rise of Steve-O.  What's the craziest thing on here?  I don't know, man.  There's a lot of early footage.  I mean, you jumping off the roofs, that's pretty crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, it's...  The fire stuff you did was unbelievable.  It's loaded.  It's loaded with stunts, man.  Nice.  And, you know, like, a lot of people just ask me so much.  They'll say, oh, how'd you get into all this?  You know, like, how'd you get your start?  And so, finally, I just put together a damn video that tells the story. 
[02:24:30]  There's the start.  And, you know, like, to be honest, like, I mean, it's a change of pace for my other videos,  which are just kind of nonstop mayhem.  But, uh...  Can you get this in stores?  Yeah, absolutely, man.  It's only $9.99 at Best Buy.  $9.99 for the Steve-O DVD.  I don't know what it is, man.  It's really pissing me off, but DVD prices are going way down.  Yeah.  When you finally start putting them out, right?  Yeah, and what's up with this satellite radio business?  No commercials there?  Does that mean, like, we're...  Oh, yeah, we can just hang. 
[02:25:00]  We can hang, curse, do whatever.  Yeah.  No, we can take a break so we can regroup, because we want you to do some stuff today.  Yeah, I want to smoke a cigarette.  Like, we're allowed to do that, right?  If we're allowed to say fuck, I think you can smoke a cigarette.  Yeah, why not?  Unless there's a howl-on system in here that'll go off.  Oh, which that...  No, we'll be fine.  No, that's just a water thing.  If that sprinkler goes off, I will laugh myself.  I will laugh my balls off.  I don't think they have howl in here.  It's just the water.  Like, I smoke a lot.  I recently actually, you know, I'm so proud of all these arrests I've had since I saw you last. 
[02:25:30]  Well, what about the arrest of your partner there, Chris?  Oh, yeah, that was...  Because they just handed this to me as well.  Yeah, that was brilliant.  What the hell are you guys getting arrested?  He was found completely butt-naked, passed out on the roof of a parked SUV on 10th Street  in South Beach.  Great.  Like in Miami.  And what led up to that?  A lot of drinking?  He says that somebody drugged him, but I'm telling you it was him.  And me.  Somebody drugged him. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, he did.  He drugged himself, and then he yelled and screamed at the cops, and then they pepper sprayed him.  Oh, pepper spray.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, he did not cooperate whatsoever.  He actually threatened to kick...  His quote is, I'm going to kick your posterior.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.  That was in the...  He just didn't feel like saying ass?  Did he laugh at the pepper spray, considering all the other stuff that he's done?  Yeah, no, and pepper spray is nothing to laugh at, man.  No, huh?  Have you ever been pepper sprayed?  I did a stunt called Tabasco Eye Drops, which I really... 
[02:26:30]  Oh, my God.  I had a really hard time with that one.  Well, we've seen you snort the wasabi, right?  Yeah, I'd rather snort the wasabi before Tabasco Eye Drops again.  One of the funniest parts of Jackass the movie is the electrodes, and they put the electrodes  on everybody, and they're all tightening up, and then they put them on the ball sack.  I didn't get that, though, because you see all the commercials on TV for those things,  and you really get the impression that it's for, like, kind of, like, fat ladies that...  Yeah, try to tone the muscles by making them move through electricity instead of moving 
[02:27:00]  them yourself.  You know what the sickest stunt in the Jackass movie was, and it was such a simple one?  The paper cuts.  Oh, shit!  The paper cuts.  I can't even think about it.  It was pretty much the most simple one, but, I mean, in between the fingers...  Oh, starving!  Where else did you guys do?  Oh, the corners of your mouth!  Oh!  I had one on my nose that didn't make the cut.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was...  That's the one that just made me just cringe in the movie theater. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I was...  I was...  Right between...  Just imagine the...  Look, everyone's just getting all creeped out, man.  I can't even think about it.  Just, you know?  I think for that movie, I'm most proud of the ceiling fan.  Oh, the ceiling fan's great.  I remember telling our director, I was like, dude, like...  I didn't tell him.  I want to get a vaulting...  I want a vaulting trampoline, and I want to take out my ceiling fan while I was at full speed.  And our director was like, I like that.  I like that.  All right.  Let me set up the cameras.  Good one.  Yeah, it's so cool.  Are you guys going to make another movie? 
[02:28:00]  Not Jackass.  Jackass, we certainly wouldn't do without Knoxville, but...  Right.  But that's not to say that this boy's going to get any smarter.  Yeah, Johnny doesn't have to do any of that stuff anymore.  It's amazing.  Yeah, but his personal life has always been so much more reckless than...  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's awesome.  He just rules.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  These are real quick breaks that we take, by the way.  Yeah, it's just four minutes, so you can't even sleep.  Anybody?  Pot?  Yeah, I just got to have a plan, man.  I could really...  I swallowed some, but I'm not supposed to shit it out for another three days. 
[02:28:30]  Honestly, we're trying to be a little more responsible.  We have a lot of nerds that work with us now.  Look, everyone's just shaking their head.  Oh, boy.  No pot?  Pot?  No?  Pot?  God, no.  Nothing?  Nothing?  Shit, fuck.  What happened to us?  So I got a radio station fined one time.  Really?  For telling this joke.  What a...  Yeah, you can tell it on this.  Yeah.  What do you get when you shove a butcher knife all the way up a baby's ass?  Oh, God.  A fine?  I don't know about you, but I get a mean boner. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know how that got a radio station in trouble.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Where they fined $357,000?  What's the difference between a dead baby and a refrigerator?  You can't fuck a refrigerator.  Yeah, I'm loving this radio station.  You guys are so much better now.  All right, let's take a break.  We're hanging with our old pal, Steve.  You got to do one stunt today or something.  I will. 
[02:29:30]  We'll figure something out?  Yeah, we'll think about it during the break.  All right, cool.  Man, I didn't tell you about when I got arrested on the airplane for chain smoking.  We'll do that on the airplane.  Yeah, I haven't been able to smoke on a plane in years.  I'm not going to reveal the name of the airline I'm banned from.  Chet Blow.  I know you took Chet Blow, so.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now, we'll figure something out.  All right, right.  Sweet.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons. 
[02:30:00]  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  I had an uncle that went crazy.  Crazy, man.  Everybody's got a crazy uncle.  He's usually your favorite uncle when you're a kid, too.  You don't realize he's crazy until you're about 15. 
[02:30:30]  No wonder Bobby was so much fun.  He's out of his fucking mind.  My uncle Bobby lost his mind.  You know what people do when they lose their mind?  Start repeating shit that don't mean nothing.  Every time you ask Bobby a question, you answer it the same way.  Bobby, what time is it?  If you want to feel funky, feel free.  Please don't spread that funk on me. 
[02:31:00]  What did that mean?  I'll never know.  You know what cartoon I used to hate when I was a kid?  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids.  It's like the most racist, racist, most degrading cartoon in the history of television.  I actually had a guy walking around with a damn hat pulled over his head.  And another guy going to weep or go to the store. 
[02:31:30]  Not my name is, but Billwood.  It's like, hey, hey, hey, I'm illiterate.  Egg rent.  Hi, my name is Debbie Ellis.  Can I help you?  Yes, I'm looking to fill a permanent position.  Certainly. 
[02:32:00]  Now, what kind of position are you looking to fill?  I'm looking to fill doggy style is the position.  What is that?  Doggy style.  I beg your pardon?  Doggy style.  Which means?

Coming up on Sunday is segment number six, the Mutual Admiration Society, as Quincy extends  his relationship with Michael Jackson for two more historic albums, Sunday, 7 p.m.  East and 4 in the West on XM Live, Channel 200 and Suite 62.  It's the O&A Virus.  XM 202.  XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything all the time. 
[02:33:30]  XM 202.  Prepare to be wowed.  What the knockers.  Whip them out.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know?  I say, you don't know?  Take me out.  I say, you don't know?  Don't move.  Time's low. 
[02:34:00]  I say, you don't know?  Take me out.  Hey, you got horse, man.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Steve-O's taking a dump in.  Anthony's playing Grand Theft Auto.  San Andreas.  He's shooting the homies.  He's shooting the other homies.  You're in deep trouble there, bro. 
[02:34:30]  I'm so dead.  Game looks good so far.  Run, Holmes.  What are you doing?  Oh, good.  I got a fire engine.  All right.  He just stole the fire truck.  Nice.  Pooling down the road in the fire truck.  Cops hot on his tail.  Boom.  Oh, you punk-ass bitch.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, now you're in trouble.  I got a backup.  He ran the fire truck into an alley. 
[02:35:00]  A dead end.  He's back on the road.  I just ran over that brother.  Boy, there are a lot of homies in this game.  All right.  The fire truck tooling down the...  Whoa.  Oh, very hard to steal this fire truck.  Fishtailing all over the place.  Cops hot on his tail again.  What about a fire truck?  What are they going to do?  Nothing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, just T-boing a cop.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Now you're in deep S.  Yeah, I'm really in trouble.  Now he's got a lot of cops on his tail.  Running over more homies.  I'm in a parking lot.  I'm going to get out of here.  I cannot wait to get this game.  Oh.  Crashing through the woods.  What a move.  What a move.  Just killing people on the sidewalk.  It even shows tire tracks in a body after you run it over.  That's fantastic.  Am I clean?  Am I away yet? 
[02:36:00]  No, I just hit another one.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm on fire.  The fire truck's on fire.  The cops are hitting into the back of the fire truck.  Wasted!  Fire truck exploded.  My fire truck blew up and I am dead.  I have to get a PlayStation to get this game?  Yeah.  Well, it'll be on the computer.  In July.  I'd rather get the PlayStation.  You're actually going to spend time trying to play a video game?  Yeah.  I think that'll be great to watch.  I want to kill those blotto dickheads.  Really?  Nah, man, nah.  Later.  Later, homie. 
[02:36:30]  All right, later.  Later.  Wow.  Get out the core.  We'll get back to that game in a little while here.  So, Steve-O's taking a dump.  He might have passed out in the bathroom.  Master Poe, are you keeping an eye on Steve-O?  Not in the bathroom.  He's the real deal.  Yes, I know that he's in the bathroom, but I'm not going to go into the bathroom and see what he's doing.  All right.  Maybe he's trying to get back in, though.  No, he's not.  It's like Fort Knox around here.  You go to the bathroom, you get locked out.  You've got to wait for Master Poe to let you back into the facility.  Have you seen his new toy, too? 
[02:37:00]  He's got a remote control to open up the door from down the hall.  Yeah, I saw that.  Like, he can be down by the elevator and remote control you in.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Snazzy.  By the way, this Friday, we bring back Lesbian for a Day.  Oh.  Lesbian for a Day, live in the studio.  Are you kidding?  We actually have girls?  We have two or three girls, I think.  It's going to get pretty crazy on Friday.  We make dreams come true on this show.  We truly do.  You want to explain Lesbian for a Day for the new XM Satellite Radio listeners?  It's an easy concept. 
[02:37:30]  A lot of girls want to have urges for other girls.  You know?  They have these little urges to be with another woman.  But how do you pull that off, Hope?  Maybe they have boyfriends.  Maybe they're a little shy.  They don't want to go to the clubs and get into some lesbian lifestyle.  But they still want to experiment a little with girls.  We give them the ability to do that.  We get two girls, or maybe even more, that have this fantasy, bring them down here, hook  them up on a couch, which we like to call the lesbian couch, and they go to town. 
[02:38:00]  Are we going to have a lesbian couch for Friday?  I hope so.  Someone better run to Ikea, if not.  Yeah, Ben's trying to get the lesbian couch for Friday.  If not, we'll just do it right on the rug.  Who cares?  The lesbian rug?  The lesbian rug, whatever.  And they get to go at each other and have a girl-on-girl experience that they will never forget.  Could you move your homie, he's...  What is he doing?  He's looking very impatient.  He wants back in the game here.  He really is.  Should I run him into a gang somewhere?  Just move him into traffic again.  So Lesbian for a Day is going to be Friday on the program. 
[02:38:30]  Also, John Valby making his first appearance on the brand new Opie and Anthony show.  For the first time, we get to hear John Valby's songs, Uncensored.  Can't wait for that.  Yeah.  Can you go in that building yet?  There's a building.  Can you go into it or no?  Not allowed to.  No, not yet.  No, no, no.  Just get back in traffic.  I'm trying to work this view out and I can't do it.  You're not allowed to go into buildings?  No, you are, but not that particular building.  How do you know if you can go into a building?  Well, there's all sorts of missions you gotta do.  Dude, dude, beat up that other homie. 
[02:39:00]  Get a fist fight going.  Turn around.  Yeah, turn around and get a fist fight going.  Let me see.  We're checking out GTA San Andreas.  Sorry I was gone for so long, dude, but my new...  What happened?  My new appetite for prescription pills leaves me kind of constipated from time to time.  What are you on, bro?  I don't know.  I just...  I don't know, but I didn't tell you guys, but I pulled a regular old Ben Affleck and  I got all new teeth.  Yeah?  Yeah, so...  I don't know.  Wait, what show were you... 
[02:39:30]  Were you on John McEnroe talking about the teeth?  Yeah, I had my plastic temporary ones.  And they were a little bigger and he was making fun of you or you were making fun of yourself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they were kind of goofy, like, now I've got the hot permanent ones.  Now you got them.  But, uh...  Yeah, the shit just stays sore for a while when you get all your teeth done like that,  so...  I've been fucking popping pills like it's no big deal.  You wanna get slept, bitch?  All right, uh...  Very good, Anthony.  I think he's dead.  I think you could stop.  I think he's...  Yeah, he's dead, Anthony.  He's gonna stomp this mother...  So vulnerable, asshole. 
[02:40:00]  No, yeah, yeah.  And people say, yeah, and people say I'm bad for society.  Look at this crap.  This game is gonna be banned, Steve-O.  You watch.  You watch.  Come on, punch!  Man, Anthony's angry today.  He's just beating up all the homies.  Oh, you rerun.  Oh, he ran into traffic and got hit by a car.  Ah, classic.  So far, this game definitely rocks.  And we're not even trying to do any of the missions or anything.  This is just, you know, screwing around with the streets here.  Is that a PlayStation 1 or 2?  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  Dude, I don't know.  I'm gonna beat up this woman.  It's PlayStation 2.  Look at me working over this whore.  I see that.  Nice.  Stomp her.  Run away, bitch!  I don't think she's gonna be running anywhere, Anthony.  Oh, I love this guy.  Oh, this guy is just angry.  Come on, bitch!  Very good.  Okay.  Runs away.  At least it's not using bitch as a gender-related term.  Exactly.  And now Anthony's doing a little carjacking. 
[02:41:00]  He beat up.  And now he's tooling down the road again.  Yeah, I ran over the people I beat up.  All right.  Oh, head-on collision.  Yeah, I gotta get out of the car.  I don't like the music.  Yeah, end this so we can get back to Steve.  All right.  Do something stupid.  I'll just leave him.  Yeah, I've got some.  Oh, no.  Oh, LL Cool J. Beat up LL Cool J.  You want that face left alone?  Trying to get laying out.  Doesn't the guy fight back ever?  Yeah, some of them fight back.  Oh, jeez, a cop.  All right.  All right.  Now he's taking on, like, three or four guys. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now you're in deep trouble.  You're in deep trouble now.  Two cops.  Another crackhead.  Oh, I got busted.  Busted.  Oh, that whore was knifing me.  If you're gonna get stabbed, at least let me be my hot slut like that.  All right.  We're trying to get a couple to have sex for you here today, Steve-o.  We do this thing where we have couples call and try to become the sexiest state in America,  and they just go at it on the phone, and then we decide if it's the hottest thing we've heard so far.  You know, I had this funny, funny thing happen. 
[02:42:00]  Like, we're going back years now.  We were filming Jackass, the TV show, and we were in Portland, Oregon.  And so I met this chick, and her boyfriend was out of town.  And so she was having phone sex with her boyfriend, except I was really fucking her.  Oh, jeez!  And she was, like, hamming it up on the phone, like, oh, oh, my God.  I was just kneeling behind her, just having a blast.  Oh, that is bad. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, this poor bastard was having phone sex.  Yeah, you like that, don't you?  He's on the other end.  Yeah, honey, you like that, don't you, baby?  Yeah, I'm giving it.  Wow, I'm pretty good at this phone sex.  He's really getting into it.  And then Steve-O behind her, dogging her.  Yeah, the best phone sex that bastard ever had in his life.  I'm pretty good at this, probably thinking he's all hot shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm really good.  She's getting off.  I'm amazing at this phone sex. 
[02:43:00]  It sounds like she's really being fucked.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, I'm so proud of that.  You've got to tell the airplane story that you were telling during the break.  Oh, yeah, well, I mean, I fly pretty much every day.  Like, you know, more than anyone I know, at least, I'm on airplanes.  And I've just, at one point I had enough, and I couldn't, like, I finally got, you know,  fed up with hearing how it's a felony to tamper with a smoke detector in a lavatory.  Yep. 
[02:43:30]  And they never, ever say that it's a felony to simply tamper with a cigarette.  To smoke, right?  Yes.  You're not trying to cover it up.  Yeah, and I was on this flight.  I'm not going to mention the airline.  Because I think I'm still under investigation by the Federal Aviation Association.  But, so anyway, it was...  The FAA after them, too.  Yeah, I'm feeling really unaccountable for what I say on satellite radio.  You're true.  But, so, yeah, we're on this plane full of, like, howling spring breakers, and we're flying 
[02:44:00]  to the spring break destination.  And I just decided that I work hard enough that I deserve to smoke a cigarette.  So, yeah.  They've banned smoking for years on airplanes.  Yeah, I know.  So, so I just lit one on up.  And I was trying out a new cameraman, too.  So, we were filming everything, of course.  And a couple puffs into the first cigarette.  You know, this steward dude, like, took it away from me. 
[02:44:30]  And then I lit a second one.  And it turned out that the police were waiting at the destination gate.  The police were waiting to arrest me.  So, once they told me that, I just...  And I was drunk.  Once I heard that, I just figured, well, fuck, what do I have to lose?  So, I lit up a third.  And...  Oh, now they're going to be...  Now they're going to be mad.  Now they're going to be mad.  That's where I told them, I'll show you.  Put it out.  Yeah.  You put it out on your wrist?  Yeah, I just buried it.  Because I was really pumping.  I was trying to smoke it fast.  So, there's a huge cherry.  And I just buried it right in my wrist. 
[02:45:00]  Great footage.  And, like, so the plane landed.  And nobody was allowed off.  And the cops came on first to come and get me.  But they weren't sure who they wanted.  So, I got this cameraman sitting next to me with a gigantic PD-150.  And they're trying to arrest the goddamn camera.  These stupid Dukes of Hazzard-ass cops.  So, they finally, like, walked me off the plane.  And I'm like, look, dude.  I didn't keep it fine.  Now, I didn't really take into consideration that it is a felony to destroy. 
[02:45:30]  Disregard instructions from flight crew members.  Oh, that is a felony.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know.  I don't know that I actually disregarded.  I mean, I just didn't quite understand.  I was drunk.  Well.  I misunderstood the instructions.  Of course you were.  Yeah.  And of course you did.  I misunderstood.  I did not disregard.  I misunderstood.  You thought they were saying, put this cigarette out, but feel free to light another one.  Yeah.  Well, I just wasn't sure what was going on.  If I was guilty of anything, it was simply being drunk.  Yeah.  But in any case.  That usually goes hand in hand with problems on an airplane. 
[02:46:00]  Anyone that has a problem on a plane.  Yeah.  Unless they're deciding on flying it into a building, those bastards.  Yeah.  His bastards are probably pretty drunk, too.  They were probably drunk, too.  Any problem on a plane usually involves booze.  And I could see that happening with you, Steve.  But yeah, I was very, very proud of that arrest.  It must have been a...  For you to have to have a cigarette, it must have been a long flight.  Where are you flying?  I had just been...  I had just wrapped 29 straight shooting days in India and Indonesia. 
[02:46:30]  Where it's...  From what I gather, from what I understand, it's punishable by death to smoke grass.  Wow.  Really?  So I was just...  Yeah.  You were just jonesing.  And 12 to 18 hour long filming days getting attacked by animals in third world countries.  See, that's got to be a rough thing, too, for you guys.  Yeah.  The fact that you...  I'm sure you're not too up on all the laws of these countries that you've got to...  And you could do something that probably could get you the death penalty.  Yeah, like smoking grass, I think it can, you know, it can warrant the death penalty.  Whereas if you deliberately, if you deliberately mow someone down, a pedestrian with your car, 
[02:47:00]  and intentionally kill them, like, you owe this family like $2,000 or something.  That's it, huh?  That's it, but...  So you give the family two grand, you're off the hook.  Yeah, smoke a goddamn joint and they'll kill you, though.  And, uh...  That's something.  So there I was, you know, in the bathroom thinking,  boy, I've been in here taking a dump for a while.  These pills really are giving me a, you know, constipation in it.  You know, some drugs, like, are more like laxatives.  Yeah, and others kind of back you up. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, the Lord knows I've done plenty of them in your guys' presence.  We should do something, man.  I know, so I was taking a dump in the bathroom and I decided, you know, like...  It's something I've done before.  It's great for radio.  And I don't think I ever showed it to you guys.  All right.  And, uh, now, you know, with this satellite, all this no-rules rule, I just love.  So I've decided on, on, uh, if you have a roll of duct tape, I've got a horrifying stunt for you.  A roll of duct tape.  I think we can find that.  We've got a construction crew here. 
[02:48:00]  They better have duct tape.  And we'll...  And I'll have you know that I'm not looking forward to this.  All right.  Oh, good.  All right.  That can only mean it's very entertaining.  Steve-O, we're going to film it and put it up on our website for you, too, right?  Yeah.  All right.  And then, you know, we'll promote the DVD and all that.  I don't care that I don't have that big of a cock.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Are you allowed to show full frontal male nudity on your website?  Boy, I sure hope so.  I don't think we want...  I think we're allowed, but we choose not to. 
[02:48:30]  But, you see, like, you give me a roll of duct tape, I've got this awesome stunt.  It's called Unwrapping the Wiener Mummy.  Oh, God.  There's no way you're going to do that.  Yeah.  I've done it before.  I've never enjoyed it.  And it's painful?  Oh, we got blue duct tape.  Is that duct tape or is that paint tape?  Mr. Poe.  Yeah.  There's more treacherous duct tape than this.  Yeah, that's like paint tape or something.  You want... 
[02:49:00]  We can get better duct tape.  We need some real duct tape.  Let's not be half-assing it around here.  All right.  What are you going to duct tape?  Can you duct tape an Oompa Loompa's mouth to it?  Oh, that guy, dude.  And then I think I've got to get out of the...  Yeah, I loved it back in the days when you were in the afternoons.  And I was supposed to be here for, like, 15 minutes.  And every time I'd hang out for, like, three hours.  Yeah, hang out for the whole show.  It's so awesome.  Now it's mornings, I know.  The morning thing really blows.  You said something once, like, I like hanging out with you guys because I don't get arrested on your show or something like that.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I fucking did everything in my damn power, too. 
[02:49:30]  I know.  This morning stuff is for the birds.  We might have to use the blue duct tape.  I'm just not a fan of the morning.  If he has to get out of here, we might have to use the blue...  The blue duct tape will hurt, too.  It will hurt?  It's really, you know, like...  It's all about the hurt.  Right.  And I don't know.  There's just something funny about a man mummifying his wiener with duct tape and then ripping it all off.  We don't have a regular duct tape?  All right, this blue stuff.  All right, use the blue.  Use the blue.  It's going to be just...  He was laughing at that blue duct tape going, ho, ho, ho, you got the blue duct tape.  I laugh at you. 
[02:50:00]  And here I am, like, defending my heterosexuality and getting ready to drop my drawers and mummify my penis for you.  But here they are, wearing the same shirt, ready to watch.  I know.  A couple of faggots.  I mean, let's face it.  It was an accident.  You know, I mean, we're all the kinds of guys who will fuck a dude in the ass to prove we're not homophobic, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Our baby's going to be proud of me for this one. 
[02:50:30]  I can't wait to get done with that.  That's real tape?  You're not going to be all that.  All right, that's for me.  Yeah.  How are you going to be able to have safe sex after you do something like this?  I don't know.  I'm not going to leave you chafed.  Did I ever show you guys the double back?  No, what's that?  It's the single most impressive acrobatic maneuver I can do while standing still.  The standing double back.  Standing double back.  All right, we're filming this because we know this is radio, and we'll put it up on opiumethity.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[02:51:00]  I'm going to play it like back in the old good old jackass day.  All right, here we go.  Hi, I'm Steve-O, and this is the double back.  He flops his junk back and forth really quickly, and then catches it and makes the ball of fruit.  The ball of fruit by his ass.  That's your set master pull out the door.  Oh, God.  He's taping up his sack and his dick. 
[02:51:30]  He's taping up the whole package with the blue duct tape, the sack and the...  Oh, my God.  Dude, what are you doing, man?  One of his balls are coming out of the front of the tape thing with the tip of his dick.  That's called hanging a brain.  Hanging a brain.  Hanging a brain.  No, it's called really painful.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  Okay, so my name's Steve-O, and this is Unwrapping the Wiener Mummy.  All right, unwrapping the wiener...  Ow! 
[02:52:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, God!  Oh, that's really bad, Steve-O.  It didn't hurt the balls, but it really hurt the head.  That is really bad.  You are insane, dude.  Ah!  He just unwrapped it as fast as he can.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I really wish I wouldn't have taped up the head.  Yeah.  Because other than that, I'd have been all right.  Well, there you go.  All right, so now I need some plugs over here.  Yeah, of course you do.  Of course.  We got Wild Boys, the complete first season. 
[02:52:30]  That's out on DVD?  Yeah, and it's got bonus episodes.  There's a making-of episode that never aired.  A making-out?  The making-of?  A making-out.  I was like, a making-out episode?  And that would have been perfectly acceptable for that show.  Season 3.  All right.  So, yeah, that came out yesterday.  And also, recently, my Steve-O of the Early Years.  It's a documentary about...  How you got into the wonderful world of using yourself. 
[02:53:00]  And by just about all accounts, this Steve-O of the Early Years documentary is the best DVD I've put out so far.  So, I don't know.  I think it rules.  And then there's my website, which is totally down and under construction.  Oh, okay.  Go to that in a month.  Remember to click on it in a month.  Yeah, I mean, you can check it out.  There's something else.  It's kind of like our office.  It's steveovideo.com.  Yeah.  And whatever, yeah. 
[02:53:30]  I'll be on Leno, like, for my third time now on November 2nd.  Leno loves you.  I know.  I'm psyched on that.  All of a sudden, Leno loves you.  Yeah.  Keeps having your back, so good.  Yeah, I know.  It's because I fixed up those ugly-ass teeth.  Hell yeah, man.  Well, yeah, guys.  Genuinely a pleasure to see you again.  Well, come back and see us.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's try to scoot this up to the afternoon next time, dude.  Yeah, we're working on it.  You know, we can do that.  Oh, can you?  Yeah, because we run our own channel, so.  Well, hey, thanks to Modern Chemistry, sleep is now optional. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Use a little of it, though.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'll have to get back on the...  You know, if you come up with something really good you want to do for us, we'll just turn  on the channel in the afternoon, and we'll have a little party.  Cool, man.  That sounds good.  And, yeah, maybe I'll get back on the snooters.  The snooters.  Yeah, I'll get back on here and make it snow.  That will keep you awake.  All right, guys.  Fucking hell yeah, man.  Steve, thanks, man.  There you go.  Steve-O.  Yeah, dude. 
[02:54:30]  Bravo.  There he goes, pulling his pants up as he walks out of the studio.  All right, man.  Cool, guys.  All right.  Wait a minute.  You want to take the piece of blue...  I know.  You want to take the piece of blue tape with you?  Yeah, no.  No, leave it here.  Yeah, we'll put it...  Because I'm sure no one's going to really want to pick that up.  Yeah, I'm sure.  You know what?  We'll put it on eBay.  I bet none of you guys are really interested in...  What happened?  In shaking my hand right now.  No, not...  I think we shook when you got here, so let's get it off.  All right?  All right, guys.  You're the man, Steve-O.  Take it easy, Steve. 
[02:55:00]  We love the Steve-O.  And he's off.  He's the real deal, man.  He's a lunatic.  I mean, if you think you're tough and can do crazy things, this guy just gives you the  shame.  And there you go, Steve-O.  He's the pro.  I know a lot of people that have tried to imitate things, and it's just you can't.  You have to be mentally unstable.  Look at him.  He looks like a homeless guy.  Yeah, he's got his backpack, and he's walking on out of here.  He's looking at a box, and he walks off.  All right.  What a madman. 
[02:55:30]  He is just not shy either, is he?  No.  He pulls his junk out like that.  Jesus.  I liked it better when he used to bring D.  At least she was kind of pleasant to look at.  Yeah, but look what he's banging.  You see this?  This is her right here.  Look at the picture her laying down.  It's just ridiculous.  Ridiculously hot.  See him just pulls the sheet off of that and goes, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I'm going to bug you now.  All right.  Why don't we play one of these mashups, regroup, do some more radio. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  Certainly.  Did you like the Jet Beatles, Joe Walsh one?  Jet Beatles, Joe Walsh.  Yeah, these mashups are very cool.  You put a bunch of songs together, mash them together.  Mash them.  And it kind of sounds like something.  Let me give a listen.  This is the band Jet with the Beatles and Joe Walsh. 
[02:56:30]  What the fuck is going on?  Lady Madonna, children at your feet.  Wonder how you manage to make ends meet. 
[02:57:00]  Who finds the money when you pay the rent?  Did you think that money was heaven sent?  Lady Madonna, children at your feet.  Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.  Who finds the money when you pay the rent?  Did you think that money was heaven sent?  I said I wouldn't pay it if you don't. 
[02:57:30]  I said I wouldn't pay the rent.  What the fuck is going on?  We'll be right back. 
[02:58:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:58:30]  I was walking down the street and some construction guy was shouting at me. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony.  It really is a difference between white women and black women.  And I've dated both.  Yes, I have. 
[02:59:30]  Black women get on your right.  What?  Yeah, see?  Already.  Right on.  Ain't going to give me no pussy.  But right on.  Right on, motherfucker.  Beg me.

White woman, give it up so sweet.  You know, they give it up so sweet.

[03:03:30]  What knockers.  We're about Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little controversy, because it feels so empty without me. 
[03:04:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  You put the wow on your car.  If the girls feel like it, they'll flash it if they see the wow.  Got the wow stickers.  You can go to opianthony.com.  Leave your address, and they'll mail a wow sticker out to you, okay?  And you truckers out there, keep writing wow in the dirt on the back of your trucks.  We like seeing that on the highways.  People are saying, oh, you're going to do the John McEnroe show.  Why don't you just go outside?  You'll get more viewers. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  It's the lowest rated show in America.  I do believe.  Is it really low?  Yeah.  I think there's only one show that beats it, and it's some kind of, one show that beats it as far as being the worst show.  Yeah.  And it's some kind of Food Network show.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, they're canceling the John McEnroe show.  We might be the last show.  When's it getting canceled?  Any day.  Hey, notice the film crew didn't show up today?  Maybe it was canceled this morning.  Hey, maybe it's canceled already.  Only hope.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Can we cancel? 
[03:05:00]  I don't want to be.  It's been one of these days, and maybe we just need to go home and regroup.  I don't want to be party to any wacky bit.  Huh?  I don't want to be party to any wacky bit or any wackiness.  No, I don't think we.  No, we won't.  Maybe you guys can wear your same shirts and sing, you say tomato, I say tomato.  Let's call the whole thing off.  It's friendship.  Friendship.  Remember that when Lucy and Ethel wore the same dress?  Oh, God, no.  To the show?  And they sang friendship? 
[03:05:30]  They started ripping each other's dress apart?  Ah, maybe we could do that bit.  Oh, I remember that, sure.  They could tape it in black and white.  Anthony!  Could have you come in, Jimmy, as Fred Mertz.  Pull my pants up.  Pull your pants up to your tits.  All the way up to your nips.  Punch Vivian Vance right in the throat.  All drunk.  Refusing to rehearse.  Viv, you bitch!  Yeah, so we got that to look forward to, which is great.  Which is, yeah, sure. 
[03:06:00]  Ah, sleep that.  Meh.  Anthony?  Anthony?  Yeah?  It's time for today's Tony Danza.  Oh, great!  Applause breaks.  I thought we were going to miss that today.  No, I think we're going to do some Tony Danza applause breaks.  I love this.  We played this yesterday, and we got new ones for today.  Tony Danza, aside from just being the worst talk show host ever, he milks the audience  for applause.  And the audience, so giving, so wanting to please, just claps at anything. 
[03:06:30]  Anything he does and says, oh, yeah, Tony!  They all put down their ho-hos so they could clap.  Yeah, they're all just housewives, suburban housewives.  I'm going into, you can see them with their friends.  Guess where I'm going, Sue?  Guess where I'm going?  The Tony Danza show.  I got tickets!  I'm so excited!  Yeah, yeah, it's going to be great.  I'm going to clap at everything. 
[03:07:00]  They really are a bunch of fat, applauding hens.  Just seals.  Well, here's today's Tony Danza applause break.  I'm sure it's perfectly good reasons to start applauding.  This is all from one show, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yesterday.  One right after the other.  Just yesterday's show.  This is the beginning of one show.  We told the guys, you know, how about you tape Tony Danza for a week and then give us  the best applause breaks?  Yeah.  And then we realized, no, just tape one show and give us all the applause breaks. 
[03:07:30]  One show.  There's like five of them from yesterday alone.  Listen to the drivel these people applauded.  They're pretty much applauding for no real reason.  No.  I'm on my way over and I was walking down the street and I ran into this teacher, the  special ed teacher this morning.  She was getting off the bus and she said to me, are you going to do your show?  And I went, yeah.  It's like, so I just want to tell you how great I feel and how lucky I feel and how  thankful I am because it's just the greatest job you can imagine.  I get up in the morning and come here.  This is my job and I appreciate it. 
[03:08:00]  I appreciate the company.  I appreciate the guys, the staff, the people that work, Vitrini, everybody who's involved  with the show.  But most of all, I appreciate the audience.  Whatever happens, you know, with the show to this point, I really appreciate that you've  made it possible for me to be here.  There it is.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  If that isn't just asking, begging, begging for applause, begging for applause.  And didn't that sound like maybe he had gotten out of a meeting that said the show wasn't 
[03:08:30]  doing very well?  If anything happens, you know, well, up to this point, it's been great.  The audience.  But I hear it's getting good ratings.  Stop it.  You missed the key, by the way.  You missed the key to that entire thing of who complimented him.  A special ed teacher on the bus.  Yeah.  She deals with retards and she watches your show.  What does that tell you, stupid?  It's like, wow.  The teacher must have been looking, going, wow, he's pretty functional.  He's pretty functional.  For a blithering retard. 
[03:09:00]  What a groveling ass.  Let's go to the next one here.  I got an award.  I was honored.  At City Hall.  It was incredible.  In the council chambers, the controller, William Thompson, and Kendall Stewart, and David  Westburn, the councilman, and the Italian-American Foundation, I got the Image Award.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Image Award.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[03:09:30]  I had a great moment.  You know, it's amazing.  I mean, just.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Oh, my God.  Just begging.  What an absolute dullard.  Here, he's talking about a 92-year-old vet.  I met this guy last night.  He's in.  Here he is.  Tommy Mottola, 95-year-old World War II veteran.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That'll get the applause.  Lived on the road.  Remember that guy? 
[03:10:00]  Quiet.  And that's not the Tommy Mottola from Sony, either.  That's another Tommy Mottola.  It is.  Isn't that funny?  I like when he throws in a joke.  Yeah.  He's good.  Every scene you could take and hang on the wall as a painting.  It's beautiful.  But the last scene is worth the price of admission.  And Kate Winslet's in that scene.  Kate Winslet and Dustin Hoffman, who's terrific.  I think he's watching this morning.  Morning, Dustin.  Get on the show.  I told him.  I saw Hillary Clinton.  I said hello to the senator. 
[03:10:30]  I said hello.  I met Chelsea.  I met her boyfriend, Ian.  I was out amongst them last night.  You never stopped.  Yeah.  He was out amongst them.  He was.  I was out amongst them.  I love this guy.  Ben Stiller was there with his wife Christine.  One of the two.  Two of the nicest people in Hollywood.  Really nice people in Hollywood.  Just name dropping.  Do you think before the show he just sits down and goes, what can I write down and say  that people applaud to?  These are boring thoughts to have by yourself, much less to share. 
[03:11:00]  You should be sharing it with a national audience.  Jesus, can you have some structure to your monologue?  I'm not saying you have to be a perfect polished host, but this guy, he's a beautiful person.  Who gives a shit?  I went to one of those, what do they call them?  A newspaper stand.  And I went there and I gave the guy pieces of metal out of my pocket.  They're coins.  They're coins.  And I was then able to take the paper and bring it with me without any trouble that I was 
[03:11:30]  taking it because I had given him these metal tokens in trade almost for that, what would  I call it?  Paper.  A paper.  For a paper.  And I walked away with the paper.  Shut up.  Here's the break I'm waiting for him to have.  So I got cancer and a prick.  It's all the medical books. 
[03:12:00]  Stupid ass.  We got only two more today.  Thank God.  Speaking of cooking, there's a tomato shortage.  There is.  Tomatoes?  Italians were like, first the flu shot, now tomatoes.  I can see now a guy's got flu shots on this side of tomatoes.  You want to buy a tomato?  Flu shots on this side.  Tomatoes.  And how, you know. 
[03:12:30]  How the tomatoes are Italian guy?  Again.  Again.  The laughing guinea buffoon.  The laughing guinea stereotype buffoon.  If you could translate that into black people, it would be some guy tap dancing, just going,  Lordy, Lord, there's a waddy melon shortage.  Let me tap dance.  I'll do a little soft shoe and hopefully they have some fried chicken.  Waddy melon's on this side.  White girl's on this side.  Hey, let me tell you.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  The audience.  Hoo, hoo, hoo. 
[03:13:00]  I can't believe there's a penny shortage.  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  Pennies on this side.  Jewels on this side.  Oink.  Oink.  I can't believe there's a liquor shortage.  Hey, liquor on this side.  Potatoes on that side.  I can't believe there's a T-cell shortage.  T-cells on this side. 
[03:13:30]  A sick friend on that side.  He's the worst.  Just a big, bouncing guinea stereotype.  He really is a dope.  Tomatoes.  You're tying with tomatoes.  Yeah.  You finished the thought at least?  Yeah, tying tomatoes.  Dot, dot, dot.  Asshole.  Come on.  That show cannot be doing well.  They don't even have a big studio audience.  You see when they pan the audience, the camera moves about an inch either way. 
[03:14:00]  No, they have a big audience because we're trying to get tickets so we can do a little  something.  Because there's ten seats in there you can't get tickets.  And I think we're going to get tickets sometime in like January or February.  Yeah, I'm sure the show will be going soon.  Yeah, the show will still be on.  Sure it will.  All right.  This guy wants to defend Tony Danza.  All right.  Dan from Long Island.  What's up?  What's up?  I'm calling to defend Tony Danza a little bit.  Not that I'm a big fan of that show.  But if you guys had the opportunity to get a million dollars, you'd be doing the same  shit depending on going out the house-wise.  No, you're right, dude.  And you know what? 
[03:14:30]  That's the same way I defend people that smuggle child pornography and heroin.  Because if you had a chance to make a little money, no, you're wrong.  How about some fucking dignity?  Yeah, but how about, you know, going back to the taxi, Tony Danza banged more chicks  than any of us.  That's just it.  That's just it.  It's like you go from the Tony Danza from taxi where you get this impression of him that  maybe he was, you know, some New York guy, just kind of, you know, still had some street  cred.  I don't think it's about the money either.  I think this guy doesn't have to work another day in his life. 
[03:15:00]  No, it's not about the money.  He thinks he's charming.  He's under the illusion that he's a charming, he's trying to be devil may care and he's just  making me physically ill.  He's just really bad at being a talk show host is what it is.  I don't have anything personal against Tony Danza.  I find it very funny that he is so bad at this, yet they chose him to host a show.  He's awful.  Chinese.  Sars.  Chinese.  Sars on one side, wrapped up feet on the other. 
[03:15:30]  Bound feet, small penises.  Yeah, slave ship on one side, jerking you off while she cries on the other side.  We interrupt this bit for a midget sighting.  Oh, we have a midget sighting.  We interrupt this bit for a midget sighting.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Mike, where exactly did you see this thing?  I'm on Park Avenue and 39th Street.  Ugh.  Guy's walking out of a Starbucks carrying the New York Times, and the New York Times is  approximately half the size of his, and he's carrying a Starbucks coffee. 
[03:16:00]  Tiny little pants on one side, and a huge head on the other.  Probably able to hold the Starbucks cup with his little nubby fingers.  Oh, that must be a huge cup of coffee for him.  Oh, there he is.  He's walking into 101 Park Avenue.  He's got to look like he's holding a bucket.  With a big newspaper and a big bucket of coffee.  That's right.  And in that bucket is things he can control.  All right, thank you.  All right, guys.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  We now return you to the Tony Danza bit.  Doesn't Tony Danza have a CD out where he sings?  Yes, he does.  I've never heard any of it.  He sings like Regis, I think.  He does that same type of music.  That's another thing.  You never thought Tony Danza was the old fuddy-duddy type, but I guess that's the safe  thing to do.  Of course.  You know, it's very safe.  So he's jumped on board this Frank Sinatra Regis thing.  Let's do the last applause break. 
[03:17:00]  It might not even be an applause break.  It might be just a joke.  Oh, I'm sure it's hysterical.  Can I at least look at the CD cover?  I'm trying to figure out what to play here.  Okay.  That's why we're playing the clip.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let's hear another applause break.  Well, everybody seems to care about that Ashley Simpson has Ajita.  I mean, let's be honest.  Ajita.  Ajita.  I don't know if you know that.  She ends up lip syncing a song.  And they pushed the wrong button.  By the way, that happened to me once.  On the Mr. America pageant.  I was supposed to sing the Mr. America.  Somebody pushed the wrong button and some jingle came on. 
[03:17:30]  But she said she had reflex.  Not reflox.  Reflex.  But anyway, I hope she feels better.  I don't get what she feels better.  Yeah, because he has got to add the good guy, Tony.  I hope she feels better.  One of those fat soccer mom pigs in the audience might not like the negativity if he doesn't say that.  Dear Tony, I did not like how you put down Ashley Simpson.  I'm sorry. 
[03:18:00]  You know, I've got to be a nice guy.  You know, Ashley Simpson's ass on one side, diarrhea coming out of it on the other.  That poor girl has acid reflux, just like my husband.  And sometimes he'll mount me and vomit in my face.  And I don't appreciate it being made fun of.  Like a brundle fly, just puking acid vomit up on people.  I can only give you love that lasts forever. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, Tony.  And a promise to be near each time you come.  Quiet.  Quiet.  And the only part I own for you and you alone.  That's all.  That's all.  Shut up!  Shut up!  I can only give you country walks in springtime.  And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall.  Turn it off. 
[03:19:00]  Turn it off.  Yeah.  That's all.  Turn it off!  That's all.  There are those eyes.  There are those eyes.  I have told you.  They would give you the world for joy.  All I have are these arms to enfold you.  And a love that can...  Oh. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, my God.  All those roofs will buy that.  That clip is so funny.  That turn it off.  It's the funniest clip.  His little girl just getting pounded and he's watching it.  Turn it off!  Oh, he's probably hiding behind his hands.  Oh, he was.  The clip is great because he's shifting around in his seat at first.  He's going, turn it off.  Trying to remain cool.  And then, by the end, he's screaming, turn it off, covering his eyes, but he can't look  away.  Can I ask...  I don't know if you know this unpatriotic, oh, pennies from heaven is on here. 
[03:20:00]  And God bless America.  I'd like to hear Tony's reaction.  Oh, God bless America.  This CD's not that bad.  And your shirt is not that gay.  It is bad.  This isn't a gay shirt.  Relax.  It's gay.  No, it's not.  It's pretty bad that it's Tony Danza doing it.  God bless.  This CD is not that bad.  You're saying I have a gay shirt.  That means your St. Anne has a gay shirt.  I'm saying...  I've accepted the fact that I'm wearing a gay shirt.  Attaboy, Anne.  That's the way it goes.  All right.  I mean, compared to the Regis CD, this isn't that bad. 
[03:20:30]  Little tut.  Compared to a miscarriage, this is bad.  This is horrible.  For what it is, it's not bad.  What it is, it's awful.  This is great.  Listen to this.  A little Celine Dion-sounding instrumental.  Steps up to the mic.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Danza.  God bless America.  Oh!  Land that I love. 
[03:21:00]  This is so effective.  Stand beside her.  Oh!  And guide her.  Guide her.  Through the night with a light from above.  This is horrible.  And it's trying to capitalize on this fake patriotism.  To the prairies.  To the oceans.  White with foam. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, it's dead.  My home, sweet home.  Oh, God bless America.  My home, sweet home.  Can't hit him.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  Come on. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, just nicked the sax player.  Oh, maybe Tony will sing this in the opening of the world.  Oh, you know he's just dreaming that that's going to happen.  Like, someone will hear my version of this, and I'll be singing it all over the place.  Oh.  Oh.  To the prairie.  You know what it needs?  Drum solo.  White with foam.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  America.  My home, sweet home.  Oh, hey, I got him.  About time.  Ugh.  It's not that.  It's what it is.  It's awful.  It's a horrible version of it.  How do they introduce him at the World Series?  You might recognize this man if you're over 300 pounds and has a husband who hasn't fucked  you in three years.  It might have been funny if I said, and have a husband, and not, and has a husband. 
[03:23:00]  Oops.  What's up, George?  Awful.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I agree with you, man.  It's not that horrible, but that last one, what does he think?  He's going to be the next Ray Charles?  That that's going to be the opening of, like, horrible?  That is what he's thinking.  He puts together this thing, thinking, look, it's, you know what, for what it is, it's  not that bad.  You guys are trying to make something out of it.  It's not that bad.  I mean, the Regis CD is god-awful, okay?  That's totally.  The William Shatner CD is god-awful.  That is god-awful. 
[03:23:30]  It's not, it's just, it's just whatever.  It's just there.  God bless America.  It's god-awful.  It's, I mean, I wouldn't buy it or anything, but it's, it's, it's just there.  His people are all sitting in the studio going, Tony, this is going to be the one.  Oh, I know.  See, that's why it's bad.  It's the whole background of it, and you know, the things you know were happening during the  recording session, and the, the behind the scenes that you just know, all is, yes, man.  It would have been a lot worse if you heard the Italian, you know, accent and stuff while 
[03:24:00]  he was singing, but his voice.  All right, great, great take, Tony.  Great take.  No, we don't even need to do it again.  That's going to be huge.  All right, let's say hi to Lee in Philly.  What's up, Lee?  Hey, guys, I love this show, uh, but let's lighten up on Tony Danza's shit, and let's  get back to some real radio, toots and asses and lesbos and all that good stuff.  Yeah, because we don't throw enough of that in.  Well, we haven't.  Not enough, but, uh, I mean, if I want to hear about Tony Danza, I'll sit home and watch  TV.  I'd rather hear you guys bitch about fucking that hook-nosed Jew bastard. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, you could not possibly watch it at home and be as funny as we are.  No, you're not.  Watching it for you.  We watch it for you.  All right.  Tony Danza, Jesus.  All right, I got you.  We got your point.  We watch it so you don't have to.  We haven't had sex on the show in a couple days.  No?  No, we haven't, really.  Well, then we need some.  We're hoping that, uh, you know, somebody out there would try to take the title away  from Illinois as the sexiest state in America.  Mm-hmm.  We've been waiting for that for a couple hours.  We do have the lesbian couch coming in, and we're going to have Lesbian for a Day on Friday  with John Valby.  Looking forward to that. 
[03:25:00]  Uh, yes.  Norton's falling asleep.  John Valby?  Cluster F.  Yeah.  John Valby, too, on Friday?  On Friday, yeah.  Nice.  The first time uncensored on the opening episode.  Uncensored.  Boy, everyone hated him on our other show.  They were like, why are you playing this guy?  Why is he in here?  He sucks.  The truth of the matter is, he had to cut out every other word he said, and he couldn't  play any of his songs because they're filth-ridden.  But now, uncensored John Valby on Friday.  Great.  It'll be just like college.  You could come in and drink and listen to John Valby curse. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, Kerry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  Damn it.  I was hoping it was a chick.  No, it's a guy.  We're looking for a chick to save this radio show today.  Take one for the team and save this radio show today.  We got off on the wrong foot, and we've been kind of stumbling along ever since.  Although, Steve-O helped us out a bit today.  I did see a hot midget chick at 7-Eleven, scared the bejesus out of me.  I turned around, there she is, dick high. 
[03:26:00]  It was beautiful.  What made her hot?  She was just a hot little Latino.  Was she a hot little midget chick like the one from, what the hell was that, Total Recall?  She wasn't hot.  For a midget?  For a midget?  Anything is, like, considered hot for a midget.  You guys, she had a nice set of titties, though.  I mean, I didn't really see the face.  Come on, how can you do that?  It's actually not nice.  Look at her tits, and it's right there by her, like, her box and her knees.  All one little awful package. 
[03:26:30]  You know, we once had a midget stripper on our show.  Remember?  We did.  Remember?  And she started crying?  Oh, that's right.  This midget came in, and I guess she was trying to make a living.  We propped her up on the console.  And someone talked her into, you know, I guess stripping, so they brought her in.  And we didn't know it was their first time stripping.  She had to be picked up and put on a table.  On the table.  Isn't that the worst thing when you have to, as a human being, someone has to pick you up? 
[03:27:00]  We could be a bunch of assholes.  We know that.  But in this case, we weren't.  We felt so bad for the girl.  Because all of a sudden, she's stripping, and she's just, like, realizing it's not for her.  And she's starting to tear up and stuff.  It was so...  What a great moment.  It should have been.  It was the worst, though, man.  She would have put a shoelace around her neck and then just yanked her off the console.  Little fat legs flailing.  Flailing around, little bow legs.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Man, this Tony Dandre guy, he just fucking sucks.  Have you ever seen him dance? 
[03:27:30]  He does a dance routine with it, kind of like a soft shoe.  Yeah, he does a soft shoe dance.  It's wonderful.  I like...  That's kind of endearing, actually.  According to Hope, the CD isn't so bad, so...  Oh, yeah.  It kind of reminds me of those...  Have you ever seen the Siamese twins that are joined at the head, and one of them wants  to be a country music singer?  Oh, I love that.  He's around the other one on a damn stool and pushes her around, and she sounds like...  Sounds like somebody's fucking her with a goddamn truck. 
[03:28:00]  Now, that's one of my favorite stories of all time.  Maury Povich, was it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maury.  Siamese twins.  The one wants just a normal, quote, normal life, and the other one wants a career in country  music singing, so she gets her side of the head all cut up nice and dyed.  She goes to the duty parlor for her half of that hair.  Yeah, because they share hair.  Wait, I'm going to put you on hold for a minute, because it's really loud.  I'm trying to scream over you, but...  They share a head of hair because they're connected at the head, and it's in a weird 
[03:28:30]  situation.  It's like almost the front top of the head that they're connected by, so they have to  constantly look down as they're trying to walk crab-like.  And the one that wants to be the...  No, the one that wants to be a country western singer, I think she's the one that is on the  gurney.  Yeah, they've got to keep one of them on a gurney, because they can't walk together.  And the other one that walks, and the other one that wants to walk, she just kind of wants  to quote, I have to say, quote, normal life.  Yeah.  As far as you can be with being a Siamese twin, and the other one... 
[03:29:00]  The other one wants to be a country star.  Yeah, she wants to be an entertainer, and she thinks she has a great singing voice, and she thinks  she's being booked all over, like, wherever they live.  Wearing half a cowboy hat.  Yeah, because she has a good voice.  But no, they're booking her, because it's a freak show.  Because it's a freak show.  Do you have a five-gallon hat?  But this girl, you know, she takes it very seriously, so she's got her hair done really  nice.  Yeah.  And it's a nice little dye job and everything.  Yeah, dyed half the head. 
[03:29:30]  It's like those houses you see sometimes, those duplexes in Queens, where they put different  shingles.  It's the same house, because it's two different homes connected, and it's different colored  shingles.  So it looks like half the house is done in blue shingles, half in red.  It's like, can't you get together with your neighbor and get the same color goddamn shingles?  That's what it looked like.  Half her head was like black hair, and then the other one wanted some red head thing going.  So they have a red and black head.  And half a cowboy hat.  Can you imagine being the barber, though, and having to cut and fix the hair, and then 
[03:30:00]  your hand touches that little dent where the next skull starts?  How do you not want to put a hatchet through that?  How do you touch that without going, ugh?  You know, that's not my favorite Siamese twins story, though.  I just realized.  Which one do you like?  Remember the little girls?  They must be of age by now, because this goes back about three or four years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They have...  Of age or dead, Opie.  One or the other.  I don't know.  They have one body.  Yeah.  Pretty much one normal body.  Maybe a little wider than usual. 
[03:30:30]  They split at the breastbone.  They split at the breastbone, but they have two arms, two legs.  They walk, but they have two heads.  One vag?  One vag.  That's why it's my favorite Siamese twin story of all time.  How do you decide who gets the vag?  What if one likes black eyes and the other one's a racist?  What if someone's waving?  One, three, two, one.  Johnny Mack. 
[03:31:00]  Hi, Matt.  Hello.  Hey, Johnny.  What's up, buddy?  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton in the studio.  You guys...  How's it going?  Hi, John.  We're having a really, really crappy show today.  Really?  So we're going to be...  I can relate to that.  We're going to be...  Yeah, I know you can.  So we're going to be in prime form when we head out to tape your show tonight.  Perfect.  So we had one of your old pals in here today, Steve-O.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  He was funny.  Well, when you were serving the tennis balls, Adam, that was hilarious. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, that was fun.  You know, he actually got to the point where he felt like he had to stop it, so I figured  I'd accomplish something, because he can take people shooting at him.  Yeah, he thought it would be cool for you to serve tennis balls, Adam, and I think  after the third one, he said, enough, I'm done.  Because you didn't hold back at all.  You know, those serves are going pretty good.  You know, they're in excess of about 100 miles per hour, so that was cool.  You know, he's tough, but I mean, I saw him buckle a little bit.  That was big for me.  Damn.  And you could still aim and hit things like that, huh?  Pretty well.  You know, I mean, he wasn't too far away, but I didn't get him right in the cup. 
[03:32:00]  You know, I was hoping to pop him in the cup, but I missed that cup.  Yeah, he said that today.  He's like, I told him to aim for my cup.  Yeah, right.  You caught him on the upper thigh in that soft spot there, and that was it.  You know, I got him in the ankle once.  That hurt, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what are we getting ourselves into today?  Oh, we're going to have some fun.  Is today the last show?  I don't believe so, no.  I hope not.  Are you making a comeback, or?  I think the comeback's on the way.  On the way.  Yeah, Clinton's apparently coming on the show next week. 
[03:32:30]  Really?  No, I'm kidding.  Sam Clinton from Trenton.  Sam Clinton.  Put us over the hump.  I want to do it.  I know we had it in the mix-up with the schedule in the one time, but I definitely do want to do it.  Jim blew me off, so.  Yep.  Why don't we all just do it today?  Why don't we all just.  That's the translation, yeah.  Because I have an interview.  So, then you want Jim, too, today?  We could all just.  You guys do it.  It's your thing.  I think Jim needs to come next week.  It's all you two guys today.  And do we have to do something wacky at the beginning?  Well, I think that your fans would like that, yeah. 
[03:33:00]  See, because they open their tape something at the beginning.  Yeah, I'd like to see you do that.  All right.  What do you have planned for us?  Yeah.  What do you have planned?  Let's see.  We've got to keep that a secret, don't we?  Oh, boy.  You're just like us.  You have nothing planned just like we had today.  See, because there's some kind of.  That's exactly right.  See, because I saw the opening yesterday for yesterday's show.  Yeah, what did you think of that?  And, well, I didn't quite get it.  What part are you talking about?  I don't know.  The two guys and then the chicks came out and they walked off at the. 
[03:33:30]  You mean the Amazing Kreskens?  No, it was the opening to the show.  The opening to the show.  Yeah, that was the idea was that they were complaining about how different the two girls  looked.  Yeah.  You know, the one would get the lesser of the two, but they're twins.  Right.  So it ended up that they were both exactly the same?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Because they were the twins.  Maybe it wasn't a good joke, but the idea was that someone was getting shortchanged,  but the truth is they looked exactly alike.  Yeah.  So that's like the.  Are we going to have to do some kind of beginning like that? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Good.  Hopefully it'll be better than that.  But we'll be acting?  Yeah, a little bit of acting.  See, Opie, we're going to have to act.  I know you guys can take care of it.  We've got acting chops.  I got an idea.  I got an idea, John.  How about I could smoke a crack pipe and you could punch me in the face?  That would work.  That would work.  I'll have to admit.  That would be good.  Have you read her book?  I've read the parts that concern me.  That concern you?  Are they accurate?  No, they're not. 
[03:34:30]  They're not.  But, you know, if I had the book in front of me, I could more accurately tell you which  parts.  Most of them are not accurate.  There are parts that are close to the truth.  What do you think about that?  We should have three kids.  Oh, that's close to the truth?  We should have three kids.  What do you think about the Ryan O'Neill parts?  Did you ever see anything?  Well, you know, I didn't read that part, but I certainly heard about some of the things  when we were actually together.  Yeah, she must have had some stories about Ryan that way.  So I know that there were some problems, you know, with Ryan because, for starters,  she didn't invite him to the wedding. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, that's a little odd when you don't invite Dad to your wedding.  She doesn't mention that, I believe.  From what I've heard in the book, she says that Ryan didn't come, but the truth is that  she was afraid that Ryan was going to ruin it.  Right.  I suggested to her that she should have him come.  Yeah.  Because it would end up being used against her.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  You should probably have him there and just put him in a corner somewhere.  John, I hope he shuts up.  John, when did you know that you needed to get out of this thing?  You're talking about the marriage?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I didn't know. 
[03:35:30]  Actually, she left me.  Really?  Yeah.  But you must have had something going on in your head like, man, this is just not going  well.  Well, to be truthful, I sort of wish I had.  But we had a third child in May of 91.  So that was two boys and a girl.  And that was about a year or a year and a half before it ended.  And certainly, I had some feelings that we should be getting along better than we would.  But people say, oh, that's marriage.  You know, I wish I could tell you that I was more aware of it. 
[03:36:00]  The truth was, when I look back, I'm amazed that I wasn't.  But at the time, like now, or at the time, I felt like this was still, I was actually stopping  going on and playing on the tour so that I could allow her a chance to sort of give it  a shot when she was acting.  Yeah.  So I missed the boat completely.  Were you bummed when she told you?  I was bummed, actually.  Yeah.  I felt like we had three kids and we had a lot invested into it.  But actually, I'm quite lucky because the fact that we ended up getting divorced, I have 
[03:36:30]  an opportunity to sort of get that proverbial second chance.  And Patti Smythe, who was in Scandal in the 80s, had a couple of records of her own in the  90s.  I met her on Christmas of 93, and we ended up getting together again in September of  94.  So we've been together for 10 years.  And it was certainly the best thing that ever happened to me and also the three kids that  had with Tatum, given all the shit that's gone on the last 12 years and the stability. 
[03:37:00]  And we've had two kids subsequently, and Patti had one with her first marriage.  So it's actually been a godsend that she's been there.  Yeah.  So it ended up being a good thing, actually, in retrospect.  As a matter of fact, in my book, which I know you guys have read carefully.  Oh, yeah.  Every page.  Yeah, exactly.  At one point, towards the end of the book, Tatum says to me that someday I'll thank her  for this.  You know, when we were separated, she said she wanted to be separated.  And I didn't get that at the time, but I get it a lot better now. 
[03:37:30]  As a matter of fact, I'm very thankful.  Are you guys still friends?  No, we're not.  No, no, no.  That's a tough one.  Yeah, slow down.  That's the way I'd describe it.  No, that's not how he would describe it.  Slow down.  Did you know anything about those stories she told in her book about when she was a kid?  Which stories are you referring to?  The ones with, what's her name?  I knew.  You're talking about Melanie Griffith.  Melanie Griffith, yeah.  I heard, you know, Inklings along those lines. 
[03:38:00]  I never really knew the truth about it, and I'm not sure she does, because it sounds,  from what I've seen on TV, it sounds like she doesn't remember half of it, what she says  in the book.  Yeah.  She says, I saw something where it said that she was punched by her dad when she was nominated  for an Academy Award when the announcement came, but she doesn't remember that.  She says that a friend of hers told her that.  You know, some of that is, I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that have been abused 
[03:38:30]  that don't remember things.  And then some of it is, well, if you don't remember it yourself, people are going to  question whether or not it's true.  So, it depends which way you look at it.  Yeah.  I had a tendency to believe what she said at the time, although she's thinking that maybe  she put some things out of her mind.  Yeah, it could happen.  But, you know, if you don't know and remember yourself, it's pretty tough to sort of lay  it out in a book.  Although, I know that Ryan's a crazed guy.  You know, that's, that, I don't think there's any doubt. 
[03:39:00]  But, he'd probably admit to that.  I mean, he, you know, Ryan O'Neal spent about two or three months in prison in high school.  Really?  He was a bully in high school, beat up a lot of people.  He's a strong guy.  He was a, he fought in Golden Gloves and stuff.  And, he had some altercations in high school.  And, he was, this is way before he was even an actor.  So, this goes back well before, you know, having Tatum.  Yeah, he's got a reputation, sure.  He does.  Didn't Bruce Lee give him permanent back damage, kicking him against a trailer door? 
[03:39:30]  Um, I don't think so, no.  I think that you just, unless you know something I don't, you just made that up.  No, no, I heard, I heard, I heard years ago that he was holding up like a kick pad and  Bruce Lee kicked him against a trailer door.  Oh, never heard that one.  You know, he did, I know he boxed with some professionals and he got in the ring with Joe  Frazier once on Mike Douglas and Joe Frazier broke a couple of his ribs because boxers don't  like to be sort of made fun of in the sense of actors coming on and pretending they're as  tough as fighters.  So, Joe popped him a couple of times just to, you know, wanted a little respect. 
[03:40:00]  Just to show him who's boss.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then he went home and punched Tatum in the face.  Great.  What a guy.  Well, yeah.  That, I don't know if it was that same day, but, you know, at any rate, I think it's pretty  clear and I know it was clear, you're putting me in the unenviable position of defending  my ex-wife, but I know that she had a tough upbringing.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  All right.  Hey.  And, you know, I think that we have three beautiful kids.  My kids are, you know, I have an 18, 17-year-old son, one that's just gone off to college and 
[03:40:30]  a 13-year-old daughter.  And, you know, they're better looking than both of us.  And that's, you know, we're lucky.  And so it's a good thing, you know, that we've had these three kids, but I worry for  them more than anyone else because the kids are, you know, that this isn't exactly the  easiest time for them to be, you know, rehashing this stuff after the fact.  Yeah.  Who wants to read that stuff about your mom, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  Pretty nasty.  You know, that's pretty nasty stuff.  So, you know, I sort of wish that she had had it a little bit differently, to put it mildly. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, John, did you like the Metallica show the other night?  Yeah, you know, I mean, the only thing that I disagree with is those explosions, or that  someone could give me a little bit of a cue when those...  Yeah, they had the craziest explosions I've ever seen in a concert.  I saw so many people just jumping back.  Hey, you leave shell-shocked.  It was shell-shocked.  And also that fire, you know, I think they must have missed the concert where those 200  people were killed.  They forgot about that because, you know, I think that fire thing, you know, they're too good. 
[03:41:30]  They don't even have to worry about that.  Yeah, they had a lot of explosions and a lot of fire, but...  What was that band where they, you know, they had that horrible...  Great White.  Great White.  Great White.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, sure.  You know, and there was a horrible...  And there was a fire, and because of these explosions, and then you see Metallica doing  that.  And they're a truly great band, and they sort of seem like, oh, my God, you know, why bother  even risking it?  A little difference.  The Continental Airlines Arena and some shithole in Rhode Island.  Yeah, that was the problem.  Great White took their concert stuff and put it in a club and thought it was going to be okay. 
[03:42:00]  Well-built of matches.  That's true.  That was a real tragedy, though, in Providence, so...  Yeah, and then, you know...  Hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to those people.  That's right.  As Tony Danza would say.  Yeah, that Tony Danza show stinks, John.  At least...  Well, actually, I think Tony's a pretty likable guy.  He's doing well, actually.  Yeah, but the show's awful.  Have you seen it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We watch it every day.  Every day after our show.  Because it's horrific.  You know, maybe the show's not for us, John.  Yeah, well, you know, I think it's tailored to a different audience, if you know what I'm 
[03:42:30]  saying.  It's not about if he's a good guy or not.  The show is just horrendous.  A lot of people are horrible boars that are nice guys, and he's just awful.  You know, he should stick to what he does best.  What is that?  He sings okay.  He acts pretty good.  But to be a host of a talk show, I don't like the fact that you snuck in, he sings  okay.  He sings all right.  I wish I had ratings like that.  Yeah, I know.  He's doing real well.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's incredible how well he's doing.  John, what are they doing over there at MSNBC to pump your ratings up? 
[03:43:00]  CNBC.  Oh, CNBC.  Sorry.  Maybe that's part of the problem.  Network, come on.  I go to MSNBC to look for you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what everyone's doing.  They're telling me, God, I thought you were on MSNBC, right?  I don't, you know, to be honest, I'm not sure what they're doing.  But, you know, I know all I can do is do some good shows, and I think our shows are  getting better.  And now it's going to be unbelievable.  You guys are coming on, so you're going to say it today.  We're going to rock it.  We're going to just rock your world today.  I'm going to say how you're doing.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to go off for the next 10, 15 minutes, and we're going to all be happy.  All right. 
[03:43:30]  There you go.  One of your producers called us because they wanted us to do one of our bits on your show,  and everything we suggested, like, um, yeah.  Don't do the St. Patrick's Cathedral one.  No.  Not that old gang.  They're like, yeah, we can't do the wiffle ball bat challenge on John's show.  Although he would enjoy it, we just can't do that.  What else do you have?  Well, how about guess what's in my pants?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Anything else?  Well, one time we threw cherries at girls' twats.  No.  Yeah, that ain't going to work either.  It's just hilarious because we did the pre-interview, and they're like, everything we suggested, 
[03:44:00]  like, ah, yeah, well, that's not going to work either.  That's when he made us nervous by saying, well, we'll come up with something.  We'll come up with something, and we'll tell you five minutes before we do it.  We don't want to do it.  We should, we should, uh, you guys should go for it.  Go for one of those.  That's all right.  Well, I guess.  It's 10 at night.  That's late enough, right?  It's cable.  Sure.  I mean, you guys are on satellite now.  You can pretty much do whatever you want.  If you want, we can bring a crack core down, and we, uh, we do have the wiffle ball bat,  so it's really up to you, Johnny.  It may be worth talking about.  Give it a shot.  Yeah.  I tell you, they'll be talking about your show after that one. 
[03:44:30]  That's right.  That's right.  We'll be on, uh.  That's not a bad thing.  We'll be on every news broadcast again.  They'll know what channel you're on after that one.  Penny Press is good press, right?  Right.  You want to try to guess what the wiffle ball bat challenge is all about, John?  Um, let me see.  Uh, let's see.  The wiffle ball challenge.  It's about, uh, give me a hint.  Well, it's the wiffle ball bat.  It involves a wiffle ball bat.  Okay.  Well, I'm guessing it involves some type of spanking on the ass.  Think Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe.  Mm. 
[03:45:00]  Mm.  Uh, it also involves rubber gloves and some lubricant.  Well, that's a little ugly.  Yeah.  I was like, even I might have to take a pass on that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's rough.  And we mark off the wiffle ball bat after, uh, it's finished.  The challenge is finished.  And at the end of the year, whoever has the mark closest to the middle of the bat is the winner.  This is why we're popular radio hosts.  Oh, Jesus.  People...  I should have known.  Yeah.  Others think it's because we're so witty, but no, it's because of the wiffle ball bat. 
[03:45:30]  Well, uh, you know, I know you guys can do better than that.  Come on.  Of course we can.  That's not...  Do you want to, uh, hit golf balls at us?  No, I hit golf balls.  That would, that would, I wouldn't recommend that.  No.  We could put, uh...  Although I'm a pretty bad golfer.  I don't really play golf, so yeah, I might miss you.  All golfers are bad.  We could put, uh, Tatum O'Neill masks on and you could hit tennis balls at us.  Oh.  Yeah, well, there you go.  I know.  We should do that.  Yeah, where are you going to find a Tatum O'Neill mask at this hour?  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  We once did something wacky that was very similar to what you did with Steve-O.  Anthony and I dressed in, um, uh, hockey goalie outfits and we went in the middle of a, um,  uh, uh, driving range.  Driving range at a golf course.  I had people hit, um...  Isn't that zany?  Golf balls at us.  Hmm.  Great.  We can't be doing that either, Opie.  Uh, we don't have much room there to do a lot of things.  I mean, it's a good studio, but it's not that roomy.  Yeah, not as roomy as you, you can't tee off a shot.  No, no, no, I don't think so.  Unless we have people sign papers. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, I think we're going to get there, Opie.  They're going to say, okay, here's what we're going to do.  And there's going to be some acting involved.  That me and Opie are now going to have to act.  You've acted in some movies, right?  Um, um, well, there was that time in, uh, yeah.  I was in, um, um, I was in Bad News Bears.  I was playing air hockey with some girl.  Didn't they have the remake in Bad News Bears?  Yes.  Maybe you could get in on it.  Yeah, but we talked about this on the show.  They're going to remake that movie, but they're not going to allow the kids to drink.  Or curse or anything. 
[03:47:00]  I bet it's going to be all clean.  Well, then that ruins it.  I think it ruins it, definitely.  That was the best scene when they're in the dugout just drinking beers.  Maybe they're doing drugs instead.  Nah, it's going to be the PC version of that movie.  That's the problem with, uh, entertainment to work.  Did you used to turn that on and go, oh, I can't believe I have sex with her?  What's that?  Did you used to, like, flip through the channels and land on Bad News Bears and go, oh, I can't  believe I'm having sex with that girl.  No, actually.  I would have thought that.  I haven't seen it since we've separated.  Oh, really?  John Anthony asked that question. 
[03:47:30]  I was just wondering.  It's one of those things, you know.  That's not a bad thing.  As you're watching the Bad News Bears, you're like thinking, ah, you know, I wonder if he  thinks, hey.  She's still the youngest person that ever won an Academy Award.  Yeah, Paper Moon was a great movie.  I just saw it recently.  With Bad News Bears.  Yeah.  And, you know, she actually set some pretty good run there for a while.  Little Darlings was a good one.  Little Darlings.  Oh, there you go.  Christy McNichol and the always good Armand Asante, who never overacts.  Matt Dillon.  Right.  Matt Dillon in that one.  Sure.  You know, and then she went into her teenage years, and then, you know, I have to take 
[03:48:00]  some responsibility, because when we met, she was only 20, and when we had our first  kid, she was 22.  So it was, you know, there was also a mistake on my part that at 27 years of age, which is  what I was, and she was 22, that we could handle that and be able to combine being parents  at that age, and also try to be the best tennis player in the world, and figure out how to  have a good marriage. 
[03:48:30]  And have her acting or something.  As much as I love her, you know, she actually didn't want to act.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she didn't want to act.  She said, she asked me if I would still love her if she didn't act.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I said, of course I would.  Yeah.  Of course I will.  Was she really acting a lot at that age?  No.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Yeah, she didn't really act at all from about 16 to 20, and she had just finished a movie  when we started going out that didn't stay in the theaters too long.  Man, you're talking about Tatum a lot today, man.  I'll tell you, man. 
[03:49:00]  You guys have gotten it out of me.  How bad did you want to smash that judge in the face for, uh, did you see obviously  what happened to one of the Williams sisters?  Say that again?  You saw what happened to, which Williams sister was it?  I mean, who knows?  Venus or the other one?  Oh, the, what happened to him?  The one that got fucked by the line judge?  Oh, it was Serena, yeah.  Oh, all right.  How bad did you want to smash that guy's face?  Let's put it this way.  I could relate.  Yeah, I bet.  I could definitely relate.  I could, I could feel what she was going through, and, um.  She should have thrown a temper tantrum.  She should have, actually.  It would have been cool. 
[03:49:30]  She actually kept her cool very well, and then they act like, uh, it's okay, but, you  know, that's, that's a hell of a lot better than I would have done.  Occasionally, they play some old clips of you, and they're just hysterical to watch,  man.  Thank you.  You just unload on them.  It's the best.  And they're sitting there trying to be all prim, proper, and judgely, and you're just  lambasting.  You made tennis interesting.  Nobody wanted to watch tennis, really, until you came along, because you made it interesting.  You were like a rock star in tennis.  Thank you.  Screaming at judges.  That's what everybody should do.  I try to make tennis like the other sports.  You know, if you watch a baseball game, they're out there screaming and yelling, and people 
[03:50:00]  love that and going crazy, and on a hockey rink, they're yelling at each other.  Yeah, but they're saying on a football field isn't pretty, or  printable.  Yeah, but it pissed off some of the tennis-like purists.  They're like, what is this guy doing?  He's out here screaming.  He's supposed to be all dignified.  With all due respect, who gives a shit about them?  All right.  Exactly.  You know, tennis needs to get into the 21st century, so I think that that's something  that I try to do, and sadly, I think I failed on some level, because they actually tightened  the rules because of myself and Nastassi and Connors, and so now it's gone this other 
[03:50:30]  way where they're like, God, I wish it was like when McEnroe, Connors, and Nastassi  were playing.  Yeah, you just want brawls.  Yeah, we don't hit anyone in tennis, so that's frustrating.  Even if I had lost a couple fights, it would have been nice to sort of mix it up a little  bit.  So, John, where does the anger come from?  You know, that's a good question.  I don't have an answer for that.  Or is it just, I was going to say, or is it kind of like fake anger?  But no, it has to come from somewhere.  It was real anger, but it wasn't like I grew up in a family.  My parents are still together to this day.  It was just that you were that competitive and just would get frustrated? 
[03:51:00]  I guess so.  It was also a situation where I learned early on that the better I got, the more I could  get away with.  So it's an incentive to get better.  Oh my God, you're talking about something we can completely relate to.  Because with our radio show, that's how we felt at the old place.  Like, you know, the better we got, the higher ratings we were getting.  You know, no one was telling us no.  And we were literally getting away with murder until that fateful day. 
[03:51:30]  You took it a step, and I think you guys would even agree, a step too far.  Of course.  Yeah, that's what's the will.  So what happened is if I had gone out there and actually, like, punched out an umpire,  which I never did.  People, I never touched any umpire.  But you thought it.  You thought, hmm, how far can I take this?  I took it to about as far as it could be without getting myself, hurting my career.  Was there ever an incident where you just did it for the hell of it and you really  weren't that pissed off?  You know, I do that all the time now because the irony is that I say to people, they used 
[03:52:00]  to find me when I cursed at umpires.  Now, in the senior store that I play, they find me if I don't curse at them.  Yeah, they want to see it.  And towards the end of my career, I guess when I had kids, it didn't seem quite as intense  or sincere because it seemed like it was more important.  When you see all my kids, I have six kids and one stepdaughter, but the other five, I  was in the delivery room and you see this and then you think, hey, maybe a tennis match  isn't that intense.  Do you guys have kids?  No.  No.  Not that we know of.  That old gag. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, boy.  Those are the type of jokes you're going to get today, by the way.  I know.  That's true.  And realizing that I lost a little bit of that intensity.  I was still pretty intense, but it made it say like, because I used to think tennis is  the end all and be all and I've got to change this sport.  I'm going to do whatever it takes.  And you sort of, you lose a little bit.  So I did find myself at times, maybe at the end of my career, wondering why I was doing  this.  If it was just for the act, you know, sort of a caricature of myself.  Yeah, right on. 
[03:53:00]  Cool.  Is someone saying that you're Ozzy's neighbor?  Is that true?  Like, you guys got an Ozzy?  No, he was there temporarily, I think, in Malibu, you know, where I used to live.  I'm just asking, Jim Norton's a huge Ozzy fan, that's all.  I am a big Ozzy fan, too, but I saw him one time, or a couple times on the beach where  a friend of mine is, but he's not.  I'm a few miles away from him.  Did you guys hang out at all?  No, no.  You know, actually, I've never hung out.  I saw Metallica once, ironically enough, or I saw him a couple times.  I once was in the Meadowlands with Lars Ulrich, the drummer from Metallica, so, of course, 
[03:53:30]  we got the first-class treatment right to the side of the stage, and, you know, I was  about eight feet from Ozzy, and it was very intense, and it was very cool to see it, but  then he couldn't talk after the show.  He was saving his voice.  Maybe you got the first-class treatment because you're John McEnroe.  Well, you know, that helped a little bit.  To be with Lars Ulrich, the drummer from Metallica, didn't hurt either, so it was a nice combination,  so it was very cool to see.  And I've become somewhat friends with Tony Iommi, who's a left-handed guitar player, 
[03:54:00]  which is what I am.  Of course he's left.  He's missing three fingertips.  I know all about Iommi.  Is he in New York now?  Okay, here's a trivia question, then.  What was the band he was in before Black Sabbath?  Well, Sabbath was originally called Rare Earth, and before that it was the Polka Talc Blues Band.  I'm not exactly sure of what band Iommi was in, though.  He was in Jethro Tull's band.  I did not know that.  Did you see that rock and roll circus at Stones, the old Stones thing where The Who played with them?  No.  You've got to pick that up because that was one of the all-time shows. 
[03:54:30]  They had John Lennon in the audience, and they had The Stones play.  They didn't release it because supposedly The Who were so great.  I don't know if you ever heard about that.  And the opening for The Who, before The Who and The Stones, was Jethro Tull with Tony Iommi on guitar.  So when are you going to see Tony Iommi again?  I don't know.  I saw him.  He actually called me when he was around, and he said he's got a new guitar that's being made for him,  and he wanted to make one for me, so I was pumped up.  I was supposed to see him in London when I did this tennis thing that I played in the Wembley Arena about three weeks ago. 
[03:55:00]  He was supposed to come down with, here's a name-dropping, Robert Plant.  Wow.  You met Robert Plant?  My favorite all-time band.  Led Zeppelin, baby.  Come on.  Come on.  His son, who's about 12 or 13, is a big tennis fan, so he's come down to Wimbledon the last couple years,  and the French, and even at the U.S. Open, he came on the show.  So you've got to see, it's Opie and Anthony and Robert Plant on the show. 
[03:55:30]  That's a good man.  And anyway, he came down to London, and he was supposed to bring Tony Iommi, but sadly, Tony didn't come, so next time.  Is Robert Plant a cool guy?  He's a very cool guy.  Oh, my God.  He's unbelievable.  I would just stutter.  I mean, have you ever been starstruck by any of these guys?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, freaking the singer of Led Zeppelin.  The best thing that's ever happened to me, besides being the best tennis player in the world,  was the fact that I got an opportunity to meet all these people and be in. 
[03:56:00]  Did you get to jam with Robert?  No, no.  Could you imagine?  He said that he'd be willing to do that, suffer through that at one point.  Did you get photos with these people?  I've got a lot of photos, yeah.  Good man.  Absolutely.  All right.  John, we're going to let you go, because we've got to get over there.  Let me get ready for you guys.  Yeah, hopefully this will work out.  We're a little nervous.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  We'll have some fun today, okay?  We'll have some fun.  All right, John.  Right on.  Good luck with the satellite thing.  Thank you.  You don't have to go more over the top just because it's satellite, though. 
[03:56:30]  No, we're not.  You know what I'm saying?  We've been telling our listeners, don't curse just to curse.  And, you know, once in a while we get crazy, but then we do the show we know how to do.  That's all.  There you go.  Say hi to Patty for us.  Goodbye to you, you know?  Exactly.  She's a hot lady there.  She is a hot lady.  All right.  We'll see you in a little while, John.  We'll see you in a bit.  Thank you.  See you, man.  There's John McEnroe.  Cool.  He's great.  Friends of Tony Iommi, how great is that?  Well, for you, people are saying on Instant Feedback, stop drooling, Jim.  Wipe your pants off. 
[03:57:00]  Dripping clear stuff, talking about Black Sabbath.  Well, look, the way I look at Tony Iommi is the way Ope looks at Tony Danza.  It's just with that awe.  You're a big fan of his music.  I'm not a big fan of his music, but I'm a little more honest than you.  That CD is not that bad.  Would I go out and buy it?  Of course not.  But it's not that bad.  Is it great?  Of course not.  Is it awful?  It's not awful.  It's just kind of there.  I'll tell you what's not that bad.  U2 is not that bad.  I'll listen to U2.  Easy with the U2. 
[03:57:30]  That's what I think when I hear U2.  U2, greatest band in the world.  I'm not.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  This show was a mess.  He lip syncs.  Honestly, if you're taking a day off from listening to the Opie and Anthony show, today's the day.  You don't have to listen to the replay.  It was kind of awful.  Steve-O was all right, though, and the show started off with more frustration, so check  it out.  The entire nation to sit through a massive picture.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:58:00]  Customer service, may I help you?  Yes.  I need the location for where I can ship a package.  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Knoxville, please.  What?  Knoxville.  Oh, yeah.  How much does it weigh?  I don't know.  That's why I need to take it somewhere.  You don't know.  How am I supposed to track how much it's going to cost?  You don't know how much it weighs.  What's the matter with you? 
[03:58:30]  Sir, I just wanted to know if there was a service center in Knoxville that I could go to.  But I told you, I need to know how much your package was.  I need to know the dimensions before I can tell you how much it's going to cost you.  You people calling up.  I need that information.  Sir, how am I supposed to know how much?  You would just shut up and let me explain to you.  I need to know.  Excuse me? 
[03:59:00]  Let me explain.  You just calm your ass down, young lady.  You work for ***, yes, sir?  Yeah, give me the dimensions of your package so I can hurry up and take another call.  I've been here since 8 o'clock this morning.  Sir, I cannot believe that you represent ***.  You better get another job.  We have words in the South.  They don't have in other parts of the country.  Now, you come to the South, we have words like yonk to. 
[03:59:30]  We go in them all, yonk to.  What letter does that start with?  Does anybody know?  I like this word a lot.  All right.  That's a word in Texas.  All right.  Well, lunchtime every day you'll hear somebody say,  Hey, gee yet?  No, gee.  You don't, too?  All right.
