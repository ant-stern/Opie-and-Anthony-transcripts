<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their Fourth of July holiday.  They recounted a boat party on Billy Mac's boat, attended by staff including E-Rock and Danny, which involved significant alcohol consumption. The return trip was equally chaotic, with drunken and unsteady passengers.  This was followed by a negative experience with a party bus driver, described using derogatory terms, who was difficult about payment and left the bus in a mess, including the remnants of a massive six-foot hero sandwich.

The hosts then criticized their lower Philadelphia ratings compared to "Preston and Steve," using derogatory language. They promoted upcoming events: book signings (Jimmy and Opie), a Philadelphia broadcast, "What's the Weirdest Thing You Own?" contest (Part 2), an amateur stand-up comedy competition, and a visit to a motorcycle run.  A major portion of the show focused on a hotel booking controversy in Philadelphia, resulting from complaints about their previous stay. They bickered playfully about their individual contributions to the incident.

A news report on the "Redneck Games" prompted a discussion on racial double standards in comedy, escalating into repeated use of highly offensive racial slurs and a fictional, offensive "funeral" for a racial slur, followed by apologies.  The segment concluded with further riffing on "Preston and Steve" and a brief mention of Live Earth.

The Madonna-penned Live Earth theme song was heavily criticized as "boring" and lacking effort.  The conversation expanded to environmental concerns, global warming, the pollution contributions of developing nations like China and India, and the darkly humorous suggestion of population control. This transitioned into a lengthy, vulgar discussion of negative experiences with room service at the Philadelphia Sofitel, featuring numerous anecdotes from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's upcoming book release was promoted, featuring a photo of him semi-nude with a plus-sized woman, who called in to discuss the photoshoot. The show ended with a ridiculous story of the day (a tree-disguised bank robber) and a feel-good story of the day (a beheaded cat), along with promotion for upcoming Philadelphia and Boston shows, hinting at a possible military-related announcement for the Boston show.

The next segment began with a discussion about the dangers faced by entertainers in Iraq, seguing into a debate on the double standard in media reactions to racial slurs, citing Don Imus and a news anchor using a stereotypical redneck voice. A caller complained about this double standard, leading to discussions on perceived guilt of older white people, the prevalence of such humor across various groups, and criticism of Reverend Al Sharpton.  A significant portion focused on A&E's *The First 48*, analyzing its depiction of black-on-black crime, interrogation techniques, and stereotypical portrayals.  This was interspersed with listener calls, a discussion of a Paul McCartney music video, and an anecdote about Jimmy Norton's experience on a Gay Pride parade train. The segment ended with continued discussion of *The First 48* and an impersonation of the *Quincy* opening credits.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to a vulgar and sexually suggestive analysis of the *Quincy, M.E.* opening sequence, focusing on Jack Klugman and Robert Reed's portrayals and a woman in a bikini.  This was interspersed with audio from the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, including a call with Pat from Munaki and a brief call with Joey Chestnut.  Joey Chestnut's record-breaking win and graphic descriptions of the contestants' eating habits and bodily functions were discussed.  The segment concluded with plans to invite Chestnut back on the show.

The final segment began by securing Joey Chestnut for their annual eggnog drinking contest, followed by discussion of Pat's van troubles and plans for a large-scale eggnog contest.  Technical difficulties with the phone lines and studio renovations were discussed.  A caller, Francine, recounted her recent firing from her job as a property manager, sparking sexually explicit speculation about the reasons.  This led to a bizarre story involving a miscarriage and being drugged by a former boss.  Her employment history, educational background (NYU), and future aspirations were discussed, with the hosts offering to help her find a new job.  The NAACP's planned "funeral" for the n-word and its use in rap music were discussed.  Francine's sister was mentioned, with a promised (but unseen) picture.  The show concluded with promotion for a free comedy show for military personnel and an extended, crude exchange between Francine and Anthony, including a brief game called "Match Wits with a Halfwit."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on. Whose fault was that delay?  No.  Oh, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say? 
[00:01:00]  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the Hams.  I do not touch that.  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  Oh, my God.  They are sick.  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch them all.  It's time for people to understand these are words. 
[00:01:30]  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Hi.  Back.  Morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Took a few extra days for the 4th of July holiday.  Big holiday.  Like when it falls in the middle of the week.  Oh, we'll just take the rest of the week, too.  Only radio guys can do that.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people that have real jobs, you're like, this sucks.  They got to be there.  They have to.  Yeah, they had to work Thursday and Friday.  I can't tell you how many people I talked to that are like, I got to work tomorrow. 
[00:02:30]  I got to work Friday.  Not us.  Not us radio guys.  I don't know how people work the day after the 4th.  I would even take that off like when I was working for a living.  Yeah.  I would never go in the day after the 4th.  Well, you turned the 4th of July into your own special New Year's Eve.  It's just fun.  Anthony has two New Year's Eves a year.  It's a day for beer.  July 5th, you'd have to call in with a case of acute alcoholism.  He has. 
[00:03:00]  Well, you saw Jimmy.  It's all about drinking beer.  Jimmy was on the boat.  On the old River Rose.  Billy Mac's boat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, the one that goes out once a year with heterosexual people and 364 days a year  with homosexuals.  Well, he found a market.  I guess he did.  He's making a lot of money.  He found a niche.  With the gay cruises.  So he does gay cruises all year long except for the 4th of July.  And then he has just what? 
[00:03:30]  What?  Well, I talked to him.  He has the gay cruises.  But he also does this other thing where he'll just, like, rent the boat out.  And he doesn't care.  He doesn't have to do anything like this.  He's there.  He's involved in the activity of the 4th of July.  He knows all the people, a lot of the people on the boat.  You know, knows all us and everything like that.  But on the other days, he'll just rent it out and not even know or go with the people.  Like, they just take the boat.  I guess they got their own captain. 
[00:04:00]  For all he knows, they're, like, smuggling drugs from Haiti or something up here.  He says there's a lot of, like, Jamaican parties.  So they'll go out and, you know, party on the boat, come back, and that's it.  But this one, you know, he goes out on.  And we hung out.  Jimmy was there.  Yeah, fun Jimmy.  A fine gal.  Yeah, actually, yeah.  Me and my girlfriend had a good time.  We didn't argue.  We had fun among the alcoholics.  Oh, it was, what, a bunch of drugs. 
[00:04:30]  That's all I was thinking was, like, does that really suck for you to have to be around just drunken people?  No, she doesn't drink, so it was cool.  Like, no, it doesn't bother me.  I'm used to it from comedy.  I mean, everyone, they're all drinking, so it's like, nah.  Yeah, but that's, like, the crowd you're in front of.  It's not the people you're hanging out with.  You don't have to hang with the drunk crowd that you've just performed in front of.  But, like, to hang out with.  You can't go anywhere.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[00:05:00]  You're trapped on a boat with drunks.  I start thinking Natalie Wood didn't have it too bad.  See, I always need an escape route.  Yeah, you need a way off.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I could easily hang out with the alcoholics.  It's a short swim.  But I need an escape route when it gets too much.  It's just the river.  We're in the middle of it, so it's a short swim over to the FDR.  Yeah.  Whatever you want to do.  And if you have any doubt that we come from apes, like, as a species, just look at people  on the 4th of July.  It's like thousands of people stand there to look at colors. 
[00:05:30]  In the sky.  Yeah.  Take their dumb lawn chairs and go home.  It's like, what's the matter with us?  The sides of the East River are just packed with people on the Manhattan side and on the  Retard Island side, Roosevelt Island.  Just packed.  And like Jim said, they just stare.  Ooh.  Oh.  Ooh.  And then they just go away.  Take their possessions and leave.  And the boats turn around and they go back.  You know?  It is kind of stupid if you really think about it. 
[00:06:00]  It really is.  Like, that's why I think the drinking comes in handy.  There's a lot of.  And you're able to just do the drink.  Ooh.  Ah.  Ooh.  I think the most entertaining part, though, is riding the boat back.  And there's a lot of boats that come back to the marina right there behind Shea Stadium.  And it makes a lot of waves.  It makes the water a little choppy, a little choppy.  How many people were puking?  Not puking, but drunk people, old people trying to dance.  It's hysterical.  Because I'm standing there looking, holding on, going, oh, here comes a good one. 
[00:06:30]  Here comes a good one.  And the boat will just rock over sideways.  And you'll see a whole bunch of old people just shift over and hit the tables.  Fall on their ass.  It's just hysterical.  There was an old lady who was dancing all night.  And she was having a ball.  And at one point, as we're coming back, those boats were going by.  And she's standing by this awful metal stairs.  Yeah.  And I said to my girlfriend, that lady is in position to give me the greatest moment of 
[00:07:00]  my life.  If just one wrong wave hits, if she would have went backwards with that little thing tied  around her neck, I would have retired from living.  A little American flag thing tied around her neck.  And just, yeah, to see her fall back on the stairs and see those, like, old people stockings  sticking up with her old people high-heeled shoes.  Just, oh, and here, oh!  Oh, what a blast.  And then the fish, you know, go take a peek, take a little nibble, nibble, nibble, nibble, 
[00:07:30]  nibble.  No, no, she wouldn't have fallen into the water.  No, no.  This would have been a great fall down the metal stairs onto the floor.  To the other deck.  To the deck below.  That would be better than going in the water, though?  Well, in the water would have been good, but we couldn't have seen the aftermath.  You couldn't have heard the clanking.  Yeah.  I wanted to hear the old lady clanking.  Down the gangway.  Yes, we had fun on the 4th.  Everybody was there from the show.  You know, our own E-Rock was present. 
[00:08:00]  Nathaniel?  Our drunken staff was there.  Yeah.  By that, I just mean Danny.  It was fantastic.  And then we go out afterwards, because, now, there was a mistake made last year.  We went out on the boat, got all hammered, and decided we were all going to drive to Manhattan.  Drunk off our ass.  This year, no.  No drinking and driving?  Hired a party bus thing.  Look at you.  Being responsible.  First of all, the driver, the biggest scumbag ever. 
[00:08:30]  However, this guy was a douche.  Keith had to give him a talking to.  What was he?  Nothing.  He was trying to, like, we were having fun.  We wanted to drive into Manhattan, play some foosball, drink a little more.  Shapiro was with us there.  Oh, Rick showed up.  Rick showed up, which is just a pisser, man.  That guy's a blast.  And we want to have a good time.  And this guy starts coming over to me and wants the cash.  He goes, this is COD. 
[00:09:00]  This is COD.  And before I could even say a word, Keith comes over and he's like, don't worry about it.  No one's going anywhere.  He goes, just hold on.  These guys are trying to have a good time.  And you're, you know, trying to get cash from the guy.  And the guy wasn't even nice.  You know how most limo drivers and stuff are nice?  They're not nice.  That's what I've been getting at for years.  I mean, cab drivers and car drivers suck.  But limo drivers, they have to come up and, you know, hey, how you doing?  I got this stuff in the back for you, whatever.  This guy went beyond being just not doing that. 
[00:09:30]  He was an ass.  A complete jerk off.  Couldn't stand him.  And we let it be known.  Did you tip him?  He'll get no gratuity from me.  And something happened like that.  Like, I just tossed Keith a bunch of money and said, here, give it to him.  And Keith was like, Keith's like, well, I gave the guy the money.  He goes, no, it's supposed to be a little more than this, you know, tip.  And Keith goes, you didn't earn it.  Good.  Just sent him on his way.  Did the guy really say there's supposed to be more?  The guy asked for it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the guy asked for it. 
[00:10:00]  Where did you get this guy from?  I don't know.  It was something.  And then the owner was apologizing and everything of the company.  He was apologizing, saying, look, it wasn't even the same.  We weren't supposed to get that driver.  It was supposed to be a different one.  And I'm just doing this, you know.  And at one point, we're like, you know something?  Next time, I'm just going to drive drunk.  I'm just going to drive drunk next year.  I don't need this guy's aggravation.  We did kind of make a mess of the inside of his car.  But he was being a dicky before that. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  But for some reason, there was a six-foot hero on board.  And meat just ended up everywhere.  I don't know.  There was meat and cheese on the floor and the seats.  It was just a wreck.  By six-foot hero, I thought you meant Nathaniel.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, so we went out and did a lot of drinking at the bars and then played some foosball because that's always the big thing. 
[00:11:00]  No one beats me.  I was kicking ass.  Still the king.  I defy anybody.  And you know when the last time I played?  A year ago during that other drunken bender.  So, all comers, I challenge you all.  And then we went home.  Passed out.  For days?  Oh, Thursday was tough.  Thursday was a tough one.  That's why you can't work on Thursday.  Well, that's why, yeah.  We decided a long time ago, yeah, we got to take the day after Fourth of July off because Anthony has turned it into New Year's. 
[00:11:30]  And it's not worth attempting to do a radio show.  Then you figure Friday's right around the corner.  Why bother one day?  I love it, dude.  New York is dead.  It's so quiet that whole week.  It's fantastic.  There's nothing going on in the city.  They all leave.  Yep.  They go out east and down south.  I heard the traffic report last night from the house, you know, and the bathroom had turned on the traffic, the news, and the traffic comes on.  And they're talking about a 22-mile bumper-to-bumper backup in Jersey because people coming up from the Jersey Shore. 
[00:12:00]  Could you imagine the anger?  Imagine being stuck in a 22-mile bumper-to-bumper not moving traffic.  I would lose my mind.  Well, I drove back from Philly yesterday, but we left early because of that very reason.  Yeah, after a long, like, holiday weekend, because there are people that did take the long week.  Yeah, Sunday is just a nightmare trying to get back to your city. 
[00:12:30]  Especially after the big 4th of July thing.  Sure.  Everybody might have stayed down on the shore, on the Jersey Shore for a while.  Oh, you do not want to drive in that.  It will drive you crazy.  And I just start making illegal things.  I will accept the ticket, so I drive on the shoulder.  I drive on the grass.  You know, if there's no shoulder, you know the grass that goes into the highway that's like at a 45-degree angle?  I'll drive on that.  Like you're driving a NASCAR.  It is. 
[00:13:00]  It's like you've got to kind of turn your wheel a little bit.  It's almost like the Tokyo Drift.  I'm going kind of sideways the whole way.  But I can't sit in traffic like that.  Drives me nutty.  All right, so we're back after the long weekend.  Yes.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  We've got a really, really busy week.  We've got to say good morning to Philly.  Want to wake up the Philly crew today?  Philly.  After tomorrow's show, it starts with Jimmy's book signing here in New York City at Penn Station, right? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, tomorrow night we're doing – it's a Borders book signing at 6 o'clock here in a Penn Station in New York.  And then we head to Philly to broadcast Tuesday morning from Philadelphia.  What is that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Wednesday morning.  Wednesday morning.  Oh.  See, this is where I was confused.  Yeah, we broadcast Wednesday from Philly.  And what are we having people bring in, like the weirdest thing you own?  Yeah, we're doing what's the weirdest thing you own, part two.  Part two.  The last time we did this in Philly, it was a massive success. 
[00:14:00]  So we wanted to go down to Philly and kind of reconnect with all the listeners down there  because everyone's talking about Preston and Steve, Preston and Steve, Preston and Steve.  Preston and Steve.  And we'll be honest with you.  They're kicking our ass in Philly.  We don't know why.  We took a little listen, and it's just a hacky show with a lot of voices, a lot of laughing,  and not much being accomplished.  But for some reason, Philly's digging them.  And, I don't know, the company's like, whoa, hey, ugh, ugh. 
[00:14:30]  So we're like, yeah, we'll go down to Philly and show you that we still have a massive audience down there.  Yeah.  So we're on our way, Philly.  We'll be there Wednesday and Thursday morning.  What are we doing the comedy cut?  We're having, and then Wednesday night, of course, I'm whoring my book even more in Philadelphia, Barnes & Noble,  and the guys will be there with me and meeting our fans in Philadelphia.  Well, here's the schedule.  So Tuesday here in New York, we go to Jimmy's book signing at Penn Station at 6 o'clock.  The border's in there?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:15:00]  And then we leave for Philly.  Then we broadcast from Philly Wednesday doing What's the Weirdest Thing You Own? Part 2.  I think we're going to do that Wednesday and Thursday.  And then after our show Wednesday morning, then we go see how the WOW Motorcycle Run's doing.  Because Keith is doing that from, what, New York to Philly this year?  Yep.  All right, so we'll be down there in Philly.  So then we go to that venue to check out all the creeps and freaks and pests of this fine radio show.  So we'll do a little partying with that.  And then we're off to your book signing Wednesday night. 
[00:15:30]  Where is it in Philly Wednesday night?  It's at the Barnes & Noble on Walnut Street.  Oh, Walnut Street.  Nice.  It's 6 o'clock.  And then I know Thursday morning we broadcast from Philly again.  We're having this contest.  Do we have the comedy contest, too?  We're seeing the comedian in Philly.  Are we doing that?  Yeah, YSP came up with something pretty cool.  It's the O&A Amateur Stand-Up Comedian Contest.  So if you've got any comedic chops, you come by the station on Thursday morning.  You do a little act for us.  And whoever wins that, I think, gets an opening spot at the Virus Tour when we hit the tweeter center in Camden. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, the coveted opening spot for an amateur.  Yeah.  Well, that is quite the suicide.  Hey, let me tell you something.  We should be doing that in every city.  Philadelphia is the first one we're doing it.  And we should do that because, look, as a young comic, to get on stage in front of whether it's 8,000 or 10,000 people, whether they're good or not, I mean, it's like you're not going to get that chance very often as a young comic.  So, you know, take it.  So we've got a really, really busy week starting tomorrow with Jimmy's book signing in New York. 
[00:16:30]  Then we go down to Philly.  We can't wait to reconnect with the Philly listeners.  It's been a while.  I'm down there all the time, and all I hear is Preston and Steve.  Preston and Steve.  Preston and Steve.  And then you're like, all right, fair is fair.  I'll take a peek and I'll listen.  I've got to take a peek.  Because when they're, like, doing as well as they're doing, ratings-wise, you've got to go – there's got to be something magical going on here.  Sure, sure. 
[00:17:00]  So you go there, and I – it was the, like, hackiest zoo-like crap I've ever heard.  I understand.  They're kicking our ass.  Kicking our ass.  But I have more faith in the people from Philly that – who is listening to this just nonsense, hack-old radio drivel?  I don't get it.  I guess we've just got to pile a lot of voices into the studio. 
[00:17:30]  It's a lot of, like –  And then a lot of –  Yeah.  There's a hole.  They have a hole.  What do you think, Steve?  I don't know, Preston.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  There's 80 people running around.  There's a hole.  They're constantly giving crap away.  So I guess that gets people –  Let's play a song parody.  A lot of song parodies with, you know, maybe dirty –  Here's our live song parody.  Dirty words.  What do you think, Preston?  Well, I don't know, Steve.  I just didn't get it.  I was like – the scariest thing you can imagine is to tune into a show like that that you've never – because I hadn't heard it. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  And go, oh, my God.  They got it.  They hit it on the head.  This is why.  But then you're hearing this morning zoo garbage, and they're kicking our ass.  Maybe morning zoo is in, and shock jockery is out.  If that's – you know, I don't care if shock jockery is out, but how about just talking like human beings and not having to yuck it up and throw on song parodies with the – you know, believe me, song parodies got me into the business. 
[00:18:30]  Because they're to be used very, very sparingly every day.  Let's play our 4th of July song parody.  What do you think, Preston?  I don't know, Steve.  All right, Steve.  Let's check with the 80 other people that are running around.  Hi.  Hi.  I don't know.  Hey, where's Gearbox?  I don't even know.  Oh.  But there's always – there's people with wacky names.  Do they have a tank?  Maybe we need to give everybody a wacky name. 
[00:19:00]  Well, Opie's pretty wacky.  No, that's just – you've been in your name for years, though.  Oh, all right.  When you were a kid and stuff.  I say we do something special, like in honor of Philly, every day at 710, we all put oil on our hands and slap Eric right in his face.  Nice.  All right.  That'll be our 710 feature every morning.  I think we need more phony phone calls.  Phony phone calls.  We need phony phone calls.  That, by the way, you can't do anymore.  What do you think, Preston?  All right.  All right, Steve.  And can I explain the phony phone call to people? 
[00:19:30]  They are indeed just that, phony.  You're not allowed to do them anymore.  So what you hear is like it's fake.  It is a staged thing.  The FCC does not allow you to do phony phone calls.  You cannot record people.  It's under the wiretap rule.  Only the government apparently can do phony phone calls now.  That's it.  All right.  Well, so Philly, we're coming your way to prove that we still have a massive audience down there. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, I'm down there all the time.  I know there are people listening to the show.  I haven't been in Philly since New Year's Eve, man.  Like, I am even in Philly long before that, I think.  We have a controversy down there, which we're trying to get.  Like, we can't stay at the hotel we stayed at last time because we had the nerve to come  on the air and tell the truth about the room service and how badly it sucked.  So we're trying to get audio from that, too.  We had a little controversy going on in Philadelphia.  A little?  A little controversy.  I read the emails.  Poor Karen Buck down there at WISP.  She's a true soldier of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:30]  All of a sudden, an email goes out, I don't know, like Thursday or Friday last week.  Oh, my God, we have no hotel for you guys.  No hotel.  Because you guys trashed the hotel you were in last time.  No one wants you.  No one wants you.  We're in a panic here.  We literally waited two and a half hours.  They got it wrong.  We called back.  They said, well, we're closed.  It was a nightmare.  Yeah, it was really bad.  And then by pointing it out, they tell us we can't stay in there anymore instead of  fixing your goddamn problem.  So that's the beauty of a radio show. 
[00:21:00]  Like, if you do good, we're going to tell everybody.  And it's going to help your business.  But if you do bad, you know, we're going to tell the story as well.  There are consequences.  Yeah.  If they had really good room service and everything was done properly, they would have got praise  from us and maybe a little business out of it.  So all of us are trying to figure out what we each said individually.  Well, someone said that we all said something.  I'm like, I didn't say crap.  You don't think you'd trash them?  Because you two are the room service guys. 
[00:21:30]  I'm the room service guy, too.  Jimmy's the room service.  You guys are late-night room service guys.  I'll get a bite to eat, maybe a little dessert in my room.  Maybe that wasn't good and you trashed them.  Well, E-Rock is saying that I trashed them, too.  I'm really surprised.  I want to know my participation in the trashing of the Philly Hotel.  Not only did I trash them, but I said to the woman on the phone, because I knew I was  going to trash them the next day, I said, remember this phone call.  I want you to remember this phone call. 
[00:22:00]  How horribly you guys have been.  They sent security after you?  No, no, no.  It was never...  Did the hotel dick come up?  It was the hotel dick.  Yes, daddy.  No, I was not threatening, but I always tell them, like, look, I always put it in context.  I'm going to tell the truth on the air.  I'm not going to slander you.  I'm going to tell the truth.  Right.  Remember we had this discussion.  And then they're like, all right, click.  Yeah, and then they remember the next day.  They remember when they hear it.  Ramon wants room service. 
[00:22:30]  Ramon.  Ramon.  Kenny, what's the problem?  You sat down, sweetie.  Oh, boy.  What's up, Kenny?  This won't be good.  Kenny.  No, no.  I had a room service story also.  Oh, Kenny.  But the point I wanted to bring up is, like, you know, we often talk about companies like  Jimmy had a problem with another company.  He spoke about it on the radio, and that company did the right thing and rectified everything  that Jimmy spoke about on the radio.  And this hotel should realize we have a lot of people listening to the show because it  got back to them that we were addressing them. 
[00:23:00]  Yes, it did.  Or they heard it themselves.  I think maybe a few listeners probably called.  Well, I don't want to say the name of the hotel.  I just want to know, like, if anybody knows a place other than the Sofitel that we can stay  at, we would like to stay at.  Yes.  I'm not saying that that's the place.  And I'll be honest, it's too bad because I like that hotel.  It's in a nice area of Philly.  Yeah.  Right.  You like to eat early, but if you want to eat late.  Yeah.  If you come home and want a little snack, a little tidbit while you watch a movie, you're  done.  Poor Karen Buck.  Now she's sitting there in Philly going, no, please don't. 
[00:23:30]  She doesn't need the Sofitel.  She lives in Philly.  No.  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  All right.  We're getting started, but it's a very busy week.  So I hope you guys follow us throughout the week.  Stay tuned.  We got a lot of action.  We got lots of things to accomplish this week.  And can I point out what sissies we are as like a radio show?  Like rock stars get thrown out because they throw a couch through the window and they're  banging strippers.  We said some snippy things about our grilled cheeses coming late.  Yeah.  I know some rock stars.  And all of a sudden we think we're bad asses.  What about your fruits? 
[00:24:00]  Keith Moon lobbed a TV set 40 stories down into the pool.  Led Zeppelin was fishing out of their hotel window or something, weren't they?  And we, yeah.  Oh, I don't like my onion rings.  Yeah.  There wasn't enough granola in my yogurt treat, madam.  You're supposed to send up assorted jams.  In my parfait.  My parfait was a little warm.  I'm angry.  We are fruits.  They really fast.  Just an observation. 
[00:24:30]  I was at a house warming party over the weekend in Philly.  And it got to about 2, 2.30 in the morning.  I just remember this.  And all the dips that were left outside.  Like the party started at 2 in the afternoon when the sun was beating down 95 degrees.  Yep.  On all the dips.  The mayonnaise dips and the taco dips and all the...  Nice onion dip.  All that stuff with the milk products.  2.30 in the morning, everyone's getting the munchies.  And I really wanted to maybe, you know, get some calls from the people that were at this 
[00:25:00]  housewarming party because they had to be just deathly sick yesterday.  Because at 2.30 in the morning, they decided to go for the onion dip and all these dips that  were out in that horrible sun.  I don't know.  It tastes a little tangy.  It tastes a little tangy.  I actually heard someone say, this dip tastes like fish.  Oh, you don't want it to taste like fish.  I overheard someone who was just hammering going, they were just like potato chips. 
[00:25:30]  It might have been like an onion dip type thing going, wow, this dip tastes a little fishy.  It was out in the sun for like 12 hours.  Nothing worse than having a nice humid day when you have a party and eating the chips that  turn into mini sponges.  There's no crisp left to them.  Everybody's dirty hands reaching into them.  Oh, I know.  All right.  Let's take a break into some things.  Live Earth.  What can I tell you?  Global warming, that problem is now solved because a few bands got together and performed. 
[00:26:00]  Thank God the problem is now solved.  We don't have to worry about our city's flooding because of the melting glaciers.  Yeah, we'll get into that and some other things, some other things, some other things.  But we want to say good morning to Philly.  Philly, we're coming your way Wednesday and Thursday morning.  We'll be at WYSP.  And they're trying to control it for some dumb reason, the stupid corporate lawyers are getting  involved again.  Remember the last time we broadcasted from Philly, there were hundreds and hundreds of people 
[00:26:30]  outside the studio.  They set up tents and closed circuit TVs.  It was just insane.  Actually, that was last summer when we went down for the virus tour.  This year, they're trying to get a controlled atmosphere with a listening room.  Oh, God.  We don't like control.  We don't like control.  Control stinks.  They're in a different building.  Well, whatever.  How about that?  Whatever.  Why do you have to say that?  I'm just saying. 
[00:27:00]  Why don't you put a tie on and go down to Washington and work for them?  You'd fit in perfectly.  I object.  No, see, I see it their way because they're in a different building.  No, they're going to make it fun.  I hope so.  The contest thing they wanted to get involved with.  Well, that's, yeah, we could get into that as the day goes on as well.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:27:30]  We're heading down to Philly.  There's a little controversy because the hotel we usually stay at doesn't want us anymore.  We're not welcome.  And I was shocked that I was talking to Karen Buck and some of the people down there at WISP.  And I guess we gave them a talking to on the radio after the last time we were in Philly.  Yes.  And I'm like, no way did we?  And then E-Rock is saying that we all trashed this hotel.  So E-Rock is getting the audio together.  Yeah.  He's got a rant from Jimmy, a rant from Anthony, a rant from Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then I piped in, I guess.  See, I knew it.  You were saying you were innocent in this whole thing.  Yeah, I mean, I create a lot of crap.  But when it comes to hotels, I'm easy.  I knew you were in on it.  I'm easy.  We all piped in because it was just a bad experience for everybody.  And I knew you would have piped in about it.  All right.  E-Rock is working on that.  We should have that soon.  Hey, what kind of prize do we have for these people tomorrow or for Wednesday and Thursday? 
[00:28:30]  Do we know?  I don't know, Jimmy.  Do we have a gift?  I don't know.  They're working on that down there.  That's their thing.  That's YSP's thing to figure out.  That's what they do.  Yeah, but we're pretty good with prizes.  Why don't they tell us what it is so we can announce it?  I'm sure that Karen Buck will find something nice.  All right, Karen, give us a call and tell us what the prize is.  Let Karen call and tell us.  Tanya naked.  That's what I want as a prize.  Tanya from YSP just naked.  Oh.  Does she still work there?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, good.  I hope so.  If not, rehire her.  Just so she can kick me down the stairs nude and then fire her. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, the Redneck Games.  Now you might think, ah, the Redneck Games, whatever.  But here in New York, they did a little news report on the Redneck Games.  The news report.  And the boys, they plopped this down in front of me.  I'm like, who gives a crap, you know?  Stereotypical, you know, redneck things to do for the Redneck Games.  And I'm thinking, ah, whatever.  But then I think it was Thane goes, no, no, listen to the news reporter. 
[00:29:30]  The news anchors.  The news anchors.  Where is this from?  Channel 11.  Oh, so is it these anchors right here?  Yes.  Oh.  Yes, it's those two on the left.  So we have an African-American gentleman.  Yes.  And a woman of questionable ethnicity.  And some thing.  I don't know what she is.  I'll tell you the truth.  Well, we're all going to look like her in another hundred years.  Yeah.  That old jag.  Anyway.  Because we get along so well now. 
[00:30:00]  They did their report on the Redneck Games and listened very closely to the news anchors' voices.  Okay.  It's a black guy, and I don't know what she is.  Yes.  She's a mix of a bunch of things.  She is, yeah.  I do believe.  And nothing says summer like fun in the sun.  Hey, boy, I tell you, you know, in Dublin, Georgia, they kicked off the Redneck Games.  Got to love them.  Yep, you heard right.  It's called the Redneck Games.  Thousands celebrated with activities such as bobbing for pig's feet, mud pit belly flop contest, 
[00:30:30]  steed spitting at a course, and armpit serenade.  That's where people are married to their sister.  Price of admission was $5 for adults and enjoying an armpit serenade.  Priceless.  Can you give me an armpit serenade?  I don't care who you are.  That's funny right there.  Get her done.  You going to give me an armpit serenade?  No.  Not today.  Maybe later.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:31:00]  Interesting.  And can I tell you one thing, if a black guy is hearing that type of accent talking to  him, it's never pleasant.  It's never like, I sure am glad you moved in next door, neighbor.  Can I help you with your possessions?  This country is just insane.  We have lost our minds.  Yeah.  Someone out there, one lousy person, explain to me.  Why, that's okay, but dumb Imus and his stupid little comment isn't. 
[00:31:30]  I'll explain.  You can really explain this.  I absolutely can.  Okay.  Because I'm appearing on CW11 tomorrow morning at 645, so I think whatever they do is fine.  You are.  What do you mean?  You have a radio show to do.  I'm going to promote the radio show.  It's all about the radio show.  Oh.  So you're not here tomorrow?  Of course I am.  They're like right on the street.  You've got to just run down the street.  Oh, you're going to run?  You're going to be on, and then you're going to talk about Jill Nicolini?  Yeah.  I'm going to tell her that we have a guy named Iraq who's just stalking her and who's really 
[00:32:00]  creepy and uncomfortable.  All right.  That'll be very funny.  Yes.  Believe me.  It's going to be all about you tomorrow.  Horrible things we could tell Jill Nicolini.  Wait.  So you're leaving the radio show to do TV, and then you're going to come back to the  radio show.  That's what I do.  See?  I told you we have a busy week.  Yeah.  I told you.  Very busy.  But yeah, it's amazing what you can get away with.  How come Black Eye could do that redneck voice?  Now, it wasn't Southern.  It was redneck, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Talking about marrying your sister.  All the stereotypes that go along with white trash.  Well, that's what Reverend Al gets outraged by, the stereotypes and all that. 
[00:32:30]  But this is okay.  It's because you know what it is?  White people just don't have the time or interest to just fight these things.  No one cares because it's not a big deal.  You think there's people from down South that are like, well, I am offended.  I'm on protest.  No.  They don't care.  It's a black guy doing a stereotypical white trash Southern voice.  But you do it the other way around, and it's very offensive. 
[00:33:00]  This is a major outrage.  You do certain ethnic stereotype voices.  Not even stereotype.  Just the way people, you know they talk.  Yep.  You go into Chinatown here in New York City or San Francisco.  Any other city has a Chinatown?  You go in there.  Boston has one.  Boston's got one.  I know.  And you listen to the people talk.  For some reason, you're not allowed to imitate that.  You're not allowed to do an impression of that voice, which is odd to me. 
[00:33:30]  Regardless if it's derogatory or not, you just can't do the impression, which that is beyond me.  Because that is how people are talking in Chinatown.  So if I want to describe to you my experience maybe going to Chinatown and going to a restaurant and something funny happens and do the little back and forth I had with the waiter, I couldn't do that.  Unless you're in a Jackie Chan movie or something. 
[00:34:00]  I guess that's the prerequisite.  But the black guy on the news can do a white trash southern voice and he's fine.  And even make a sleep with your sister joke.  That was the woman that said that.  But I mean.  Do you know a very wise man, a white gentleman told me recently that there is indeed a double standard and that until other like white people complain.  Like because white people don't care if black people make fun of us. 
[00:34:30]  We don't care.  Asians make fun of us.  Good.  Go ahead.  Well, honey.  How many times have you seen that one?  Of course.  It doesn't bother me.  Well, honey.  White people.  I don't know.  The Buick doesn't seem to be starting today.  That's like the black comic doing the white.  Yeah.  Guy voice.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Redneck games.  And you can just talk about it and there's no problem.  That's the last stereotype you're allowed to make fun of.  That's it.  Is the redneck.  Well, let's try to end that right now.  I heard that. 
[00:35:00]  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  Damn.  And I just lose his 35-year career over one lousy attempt at a joke.  Yeah.  And then this is the news where they're not even perceived as like a comedy show.  No, that's not supposed to be humor.  Just going off on rednecks.  And knowing that they would be okay, you know, that there's going to be no outrage.  Yeah.  No uproar.  No.  Eh, whatever.  Eh, do whatever the hell you want.  Whatever. 
[00:35:30]  Go ahead.  By the way, I think the faithful listeners know this.  We think all this stuff should be.  Oh, absolutely.  Should be fine.  Yeah.  You should be able to do it.  I should be able to say whatever the hell he wants.  Yeah.  He's saying it in front of 10 people, but I'm sure he's had some doozies the last few months.  Well, rumor has it I'm coming back in...  January, right?  January.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I'm still alive.  Old joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up. 
[00:36:00]  Jerk.  Stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the rumor mill is alive with Imus coming back in January now.  Yeah, they should hear what I've been saying off the air, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can only imagine, right, man?  Yeah.  I go into my room.  I have an N room.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the N room.  And I go in there, and it's soundproof.  And I just yell real loud the deal. 
[00:36:30]  N word.  And it makes me feel better.  You got like a panic room?  Oh, it's a panic N room.  Sometimes...  You got a panic room so you can hide from Reverend Al Sharp?  I yell so loud and so long, I need oxygen.  I have to put the oxygen mask on me from when I collapse my lung, and I keep yelling.  I can't stop, baby.  Do you think he screamed that so loud that he actually partially blacked out on his hands and knees? 
[00:37:00]  It was...  Yeah, all of a sudden, I started getting tunnel vision and sparkles in front of my eyes.  It was like sparkles.  And I woke up still screaming the word.  Very angry.  Yeah.  Well, you...  The only reason I'm coming back in January is because I want to scream that word for a few more months.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby.  You just see him in this big soundproof room. 
[00:37:30]  You know those rooms that they have at like NASA?  Yeah.  With those big cones on the ceiling?  I had one built for like $18 billion.  And that's just so no sound can escape.  And I go in there.  I make sure there's guards at the door.  And I yell that word.  I just...  I can't get a...  I just...  Baby. 
[00:38:00]  You're not even brave enough to say er.  What happened to you?  Reverend Al, baby.  You're a...  See, he doesn't want to say er, though.  Grr.  You say like er.  You're going er instead of er.  Do it right.  I'm doing right, Mr. Imus.  Imus doesn't know how much he can get away with, baby.  It's kind of a...  I'm not back yet, okay? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerk.  Stupid.  Oh, see, you paused, though.  Oh, now you're pushing it.  Let's go both ways, baby.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering whatever happened to that Al Roker thing that...  In June, I think it was?  Yeah, with the...  What was it?  The...  Oh, he made the epilepsy joke?  Epilepsy joke.  Yeah.  Nothing. 
[00:39:00]  Why would anything happen to him?  Yeah, I noticed he's still on the air.  Of course he is.  And it's funny.  We had people going down there with signs and shirts and NBC, whatever network it is, that  wouldn't let anybody through.  Security wouldn't let anybody through with, of course, a sign of protest.  Yes.  Why would they?  You know.  All right, well...  Nothing became of that.  No, it's...  We pick and choose whose careers we're going to destroy.  Right.  Yeah.  We will go after the black news guy doing the redneck voice today.  No one will even care.  Won't even be a mention in the paper tomorrow.  As was pointed out to me by a very bright white gentleman, since white people were the 
[00:39:30]  oppressors, we kind of have to take the brunt of the jokes and not be able to give them  out.  And that was actually said to me.  And that's the way corporate people think.  Yeah.  You know, there's a funeral set for the N-word.  We got it right here.  Yeah.  Do you have any information on that?  Good.  Well, members of the NAACP are...  Oh, by the way, same guy.  Same guy.  Oh, I can't wait to hear what accent he puts on for this one.  Wait, this could be interesting, so...  Oh, my God.  This guy's like...  I was going to go with like an old impressionist, Rich Little. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't want to go with Rich Little, though.  Guys, guys.  Yeah.  I just locked myself in my room with this story coming up.  I think I'm going to have to be in the room when I hear this.  A funeral for the N-word?  Yeah, a funeral for the N-word, Mr. Imus.  Isn't something supposed to be dead before you bury it?  Instead of alive, well, and kicking like a healthy horse? 
[00:40:30]  I fear there's going to be nail marks on the inside of that coffin and banging.  I hope the N-word knows that little kung fu punch from Kill Bill.  Yeah.  Because it's going to have to get out of there.  Yeah, we're burying the word alive, that's for sure.  Burying alive, baby. 
[00:41:00]  Here is a...  That's like Uma Thurman.  What?  That's like Uma.  Yeah, yeah.  And Kill Bill.  Sure.  Yeah, she was buried alive and she had to punch her way out.  Yeah.  I think the N-word's going to have to make that short fist punch.  Get out of there, baby.  Come on, N-word.  Where are you?  Get out of there.  Come on.  Come on, baby.  You can make it.  Come visit me in the soundproof room. 
[00:41:30]  How can they bury the N-word if it's here in this room with me?  All the time.  It is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up, stupid jerk.  Well, let's...  Here's the news guy that did the redneck voice.  Listen to the redneck voice again.  Well, members of the NAACP are laying the...  Sorry about that.  This one.  And nothing says summer like fun in the sun.  Hey, boy, I tell you, you know, in Dublin, Georgia, they kicked off the redneck games. 
[00:42:00]  Gotta love them.  Yep, you heard right.  It's called the redneck games.  Thousands celebrated with activities such as bobbing for pig's feet, mud pit belly flop contest,  seed spitting at a course, and armpit serenade.  That's where people...  That's the same guy that's doing this story.  And they're playing the deliverance music in the background.  It's all...  It's fine.  Some fun production guy over there goes, dude, I got the deliverance thing.  Oh, yeah, play that over it.  It's fine.  They do a great impression. 
[00:42:30]  Whitey's not outraged.  You go make fun of us all you want.  Yeah, we don't care.  Oh, yeah, silly goose.  Same guy.  Listen, all serious now.  Well, members of the NAACP are laying the N-word to rest.  Today in downtown Detroit, they'll stage a symbolic burial for the controversial racial slur.  It's in conjunction with the group's annual convention, which kicked off yesterday.  You know what they should do?  They should have this ceremony in Saudi in Boston.  Yeah.  Just wake up those people today with this. 
[00:43:00]  They're doing what?  They're doing what today?  What are they doing?  Well, the whole angle should be that, you know, N-word wouldn't want us to be sad.  It would want us to remember how fun he was in life and then how everybody's sharing fond  memories of him.  Oh, God.  I want to say goodbye to the N-word today.  I remember one time driving down the expressway, and I got cut off, and I pulled up next to 
[00:43:30]  the car and realized that the driver was of a certain ethnicity, and I yelled that word  out the window.  Of course, it was a woman because I'm afraid.  Yeah.  But yes, I do remember.  I do remember using that word.  Godspeed, N-word.  So long, dear friend.  So long.  I had such a wonderful time with it.  One time when I was still really loving the Yankees, they were beating Boston. 
[00:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Three to two in the bottom of the ninth.  Oh, yeah.  And David Ortiz came up and hit a three-run home run.  Oh, boy.  And the Yankees lost five to three.  He'll do that.  And I had so much tension, and my friend, the N-word, showed up.  Did it.  And took a lot of the air out of the balloon.  Mm-hmm.  Just want to say it's nice to know the N-word went doing what it loved.  Being the N-word. 
[00:44:30]  Making people happy.  Making people happy.  So many uses.  Of course.  Of course.  You put it before please.  It was a fun thing.  Right.  You put it before Rich, and you were my mom.  That's right.  She would always use that one.  Or if you put it before Rig, something was getting fixed constantly.  And we've all passed a joint around, haven't we?  Hey.  Don't.  Don't lip it.  I remember growing up, a young boy in the Kumia household. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  My dad could use it like a champ.  I'd like to know if anyone used it more than dear old dad.  Hey, Anthony.  What are you doing?  Why are you acting like a...  I don't know, dad.  What are you, rich just because you got $10 in your birthday card?  Yes.  I learned it from you, dad.  Clean up.  This place looks like a bunch of... 
[00:45:30]  Live here.  All right, dad.  I'll clean up.  Ah.  Hey, Deuce Chill from Pal Talk writes, Michael Richards is giving the eulogy.  Of course, I have to bring back the time.  I used it on a basketball court in front of my...  Right.  ...my shaded friends.  Yes.  And I got knocked out.  You got punched because you felt you were close enough to them to use it.  Yes.  But apparently, Opie, wrong.  Yeah.  I got a chipped tooth to prove it to this day. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  So long, good friend.  So long.  Oh, my God.  Look, Imus is throwing himself on the coffin crying.  Oh, no.  No, baby.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  You can't be dead.  Oh, don't go on me now.  Come on.  Ah.  Well.  Adios, N-Word.  But hopefully, your surviving brothers. 
[00:46:30]  Give me everything.  F***y.  F***y.  A-boo.  F***y.  All the rest will carry on your legacy.  You think all those words around the coffin?  Oh, yeah.  Any one of us are next.  All those words are coming up going, man, our days are numbered. 
[00:47:00]  Our days are numbered.  Uppity is standing there going, oh, no.  Oh, no.  They're coming for me next, Charlie.  F***y.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, survived by at least eight other epithets.  Yes.  It's a shame.  They'll all be looking at him in the coffin.  God, he looks so good.  So happy.  Look at him.  So young.  So full of life.  Yeah.  Still so full of life.  So many more reasons to still be here. 
[00:47:30]  But, alas.  We are burying the N-word.  Steve from Bayshore.  The N-word is somehow going to prove there's life after death.  Steve's a funny bastard, man.  Ah, damn you, Steve.  Ah, there you go.  Yes.  Goodbye, funny man.  Well, people have their own remembrances of the N-word. 
[00:48:00]  What is Preston and Steve doing today, Iraq?  I know they gave away rush tickets.  Ugh.  Stupid Preston and Steve.  We're coming your way, Philly.  Wednesday and Thursday.  Show up at the station.  What kind of chasers are we going to set off on Fourth of July?  I mean, it ruins the entire holiday.  How do I?  Who is there to chase?  It just doesn't sound the same without it. 
[00:48:30]  But, we're laying it in the ground.  It's being buried.  Damn.  See, they have giveaways.  That's why.  That's why Preston and Steve are kicking our ass in Philly.  We're going to figure this out.  They got giveaways.  We don't give away stuff.  It's alive.  It's alive.  It's alive.  It's alive.  Life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like all these zombie movies? 
[00:49:00]  Uh, Franken...  That's, uh...  I brought it back to life, and, um...  Franken...  Is, uh...  Yeah, he's back alive again.  And the bride of Franken...  And, uh...  And now he's pissed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, jerk.  Oh, Franken...  Oh, Franken...  Oh, Franken...  Oh, Franken... 
[00:49:30]  It's just...  Well, goodbye.  Well...  What can we say?  They buried it.  The NAACP.  Very busy today, obviously.  Very busy with the issues.  With real issues.  They gotta have a funeral for the N-word.  Perhaps they should tune in to First 48.  The show on A&E about homicide.  Ouch.  Why don't we talk about that next?  I think that's an important subject.  I don't even know why we're still babbling after Steve from Bayshore's brilliant line.  I know, Steve.  That was our out.  That was our out.  Preston and Steve don't went to go to break.  Stupid Preston and Steve. 
[00:50:00]  How about night of the living ****?  Zombie **** come up and try to eat you.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They walk the earth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I ain't giving up so easy.  Adrienne Barbeau is doing that new movie.  She's redoing it.  It's about the creature in the lake.  It's called Swamp ****. 
[00:50:30]  We'd like to apologize in advance.  Yeah, we were just trying to make jokes.  We did a bit that some people found offensive.  Yeah, yeah.  We understand the seriousness of this.  We didn't mean to hurt anybody,  but we understand that some of the words we did use were probably offensive.  Yeah.  And I want to apologize to that,  to anybody that was offended. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Words hurt.  But who are you going to accuse people of being a lover of?  You can't keep going after the apology.  How about weekend at ****?  Can we just make believe it's alive and drag it around?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby.  When there's no more room in hell,  the **** will walk the earth. 
[00:51:30]  Dawn of the ****.  All right.  Can we go to break now?  Steve, great line.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Back in my room, yeah.  I'll be busy for the next few minutes.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  I got a Ouija board.  I'm trying to talk to an old dead friend.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Preston and Steve don't sing along to songs. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's the golden nuggets.  Philly, wake the F up.  Stupid Preston and Steve.  That's what I have to say.  Why are you allowing them to kick our ass?  Philly.  We just did that fine bit on the N-word.  The funeral for the N-word.  And they're giving away rush tickets. 
[00:52:30]  I'm not Elton John.  What?  Funeral for the N-word.  By the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  Philly, we're coming your way Wednesday and Thursday.  We'll have details in a minute or two here.  It's just not going to be the same thing.  The HGIC, the head guy in charge.  It's not going to sound right.  HFIC, a head fella in charge.  HCIC, the head chap in charge.  Chap.  HGIC, the head gentleman in charge.  Of course.  We'll miss ye. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, who watched Live Earth?  That's our Live Earth break.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  God, I could have cared less about that.  Stupid outdoor.  Bore with a boring festival.  Oh, it was going to be a big success.  Come on, big success, big success. 
[00:53:30]  A lot of people are interested.  A lot of people are interested.  It's really going to help.  It's going to help.  And stop.  Oh, no.  I stopped on stupid Madonna.  With her old lady legs.  What he should have called it was Live, I'm bored because I lost the election a few years  ago.  Because that's the only reason he's involved in this crap.  It's because he has nothing else to do.  How about Live?  I should pay more attention to my son.  Jesus.  First of all, Steve, I never knew a Prius could do 100. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  Apparently, Al Gore's son.  Got up to 100 in a Prius.  Got pulled over.  Yeah, he was in a Prius, and he gets pulled over.  Yeah.  And the cops are going through some of his stuff, as they will do, find out he had some  dope on him.  A little bit of the dope.  Was it prescription, or was it...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he had some prescription drugs, which are always fun, recreational. 
[00:54:30]  Did he have pot, too?  I think he had a little of the weed.  He had a little of everything.  Some refus.  Yeah.  But Al Gore, well, he's trying to get something done, as we just sit here and make fun of  it.  Absolutely.  That's the way it should be.  But it's just...  Hey, you.  Yeah.  Don't you give up.  It's not so bad.  There's still a chance for us.  Hey, you.  Is there?  Just be yourself.  Don't be so shy. 
[00:55:00]  There's reasons why it's hard.  Keep it together.  You'll make it all right.  Our celebration is gone.  It's Madonna, man.  Wow.  This is the Live Earth theme.  Oh, it's the Live Earth theme?  Yeah.  It's not so bad.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Boring.  Shut up. 
[00:55:30]  Shut up.  Boring.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Stop whining.  Who is your daddy?  Stop whining.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life  And turn it into something funny  You son of a bitch  This sucks  Maybe she should have spent more than like an afternoon  Coming up with the theme song  For like a massive, massive worldwide event  This sounds like she came up with this like in an afternoon 
[00:56:00]  Boring  It's a dirge  Does Homer have an opinion on it again?  It sucks  Hello? Hello?  It sucks  What the hell were you thinking?  Save your soul, little sister  Save your soul, little sister  Save your soul, little sister  What does that mean?  Just stop with your friggin' overblown sense of worth 
[00:56:30]  I kinda took a peek at this live earth over the weekend  And I'm thinking, just like pretty much everyone else out there  How much fuel they wasted  Yeah  Oh my god  I mean everyone knows the big story was the quarter of a million air miles  That they all flew to get there to the various locations, these celebrities  Were they on commercial airliners already going there?  I have no idea  No, they had private jets out the you know what 
[00:57:00]  The wazoo  Out the wazoo  It's just one of these things that like  We just run out of causes that  No, it's not even that  We're just pompous  Like if you're gonna put on a live earth concert  Then like, I don't know  Go old school  And like, don't plug in  Do it in a field  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Yeah  Instead of this over-the-top production  That is just polluting everything  It's also this whole thing  I mean, it's still  And people will argue this 
[00:57:30]  But it's still like speculation  What the impact  No, it's not  What the impact is  No, it's not  Will be on the planet  On humanity  As far as this alleged global warming goes  Things like farm aid  There was some farm family, you know  Eating dirt  And they decided to do something about that  Live aid with AIDS  There were people, you know, in Africa  Dying of AIDS  They decide, you know, let's put on a concert 
[00:58:00]  It's a tangible thing  This is like some Al Gore  Panicky Pete thing  What are they, putting on a concert?  So in 50 years we could say  You really don't  Wow  You really don't think we're having an effect on the environment?  Of course we are  I've always said  But that's what we do  That's part  Everything has an effect on the environment  The friggin' ants do  Do you think the ants are holding a concert  Because they take too many cricket legs? 
[00:58:30]  We could go into  This is what we do as people  We burn things  We need fuel  We pull things out of the ground  And build things that fly with them  We're amazing  You know, we could move into Pod Talk  Because this is Pod Talk Monday  I bet you Preston and Steve aren't doing Pod Talk  They're doing a song parody  The whole wouldn't allow it  Here's our live art song parody  Oh God  Enjoy  We don't want to advocate drug use  If we really want to  Well, I'm just going to go with your thing 
[00:59:00]  Uh-huh  I just like took a little toke  Do a little Pod Talk here  If we really want to solve like global warming and stuff  We have to make some real sacrifices  You know what that is, right?  What?  We got to like off 10% of the population  I'm for it  I am so all for that  But that's  That is a  That's a real solution  You know what else  Because no matter what we do  We're continuing to multiply  Taking over the forest 
[00:59:30]  Eating all the animals  We're just  Just destroying this earth  We're the problem  Humans are the problem  We don't destroy the earth  We change it  Until it kills us  Right  And then the earth is fine  It will still wing around the sun  And everything will grow  And all this crap that we built  Will disappear  And something else might pop up  Something might not  Maybe it'll be like Mars  And it'll be like  Hey, did something ever live there? 
[01:00:00]  Right  I don't know  But for the most part  It's  It's  We're trying to save ourselves  Not the planet  We're not saving the earth  This isn't  Man  Save the planet, man  The planet's great  It's a very strong planet  It'll do whatever it wants  You see that tsunami?  You see what it did?  Yeah  That was a little  That was a little  That was nothing  On a planetary scale  That was a little shake of the tail  That was it  Nothing  Quarter million people  Dead  That's what it does  I'm just saying  Like  But we are 
[01:00:30]  If we really want to solve this stuff  We are the problem  We have to like  Reduce our numbers  That's the real solution  And you know what the bigger problem is?  Your countries like China  India  Countries that are just starting to get the hang of this  Getting into the 20th  Never mind the 21st century  And setting up these huge power plants  That are powered by coal  And they don't put filters in any of their factories  We're sitting here on gas  That's like 70 bucks a barrel 
[01:01:00]  Because we can't build new refineries  Because of environmental laws  Meanwhile China and India and other developing countries  Are just  They don't care  They're burning their own people  They take their dead  And shovel them in  And power the rest of the country with them  There's no  You think China gives a crap  About their emissions?  They're just trying to make a factory  That can build a rocket  They don't care  They want rockets that are a little better than things 
[01:01:30]  That say  Place on ground  Life fuse  Get away  They're trying to build  They're trying to get into  Like modern times  We're not the problem  The United States really isn't the problem  We love beating ourselves up as a country  The developed nations  That sit here  And do implement things like  Putting filtration devices  On factory emissions  And things like that  We love kicking our own asses  That we're not doing enough  When the developing world  Is destroying 
[01:02:00]  They're just destroying  But we can't place the blame on them  Because they're the poor people  That need to, you know  Bring themselves into this century  And the second we try to help  And go, look  We got a power plant  That's a lot better than yours  Look at the imperialists  Coming in  To build the factories  So that they can man it  And they can get the contracts  The fat oil contract  Matt  There's no winning  Matt  No winning  I would love 
[01:02:30]  If there was a cataclysmic event  I would hope to live through it  So I could be part of this  This post-apocalyptic world  That I think would be fantastic  Oh, nothing but guns  And women  A few women  Say broads  Say broads  We'd have to fight for them  Broads  And cool cars that you shoot from  Things like that, yeah  Save your soul  No! 
[01:03:00]  This is not a post-apocalyptic music  Save your soul  Little brother  Save your money  And don't buy this album  Yeah  No, here's my theme  Here's my theme 
[01:03:30]  Two days ago  I saw a rig  That'll haul that tanker  You want to get out of here?  Talk to me  That's what I want  Mad Anthony  No!  That stinks!  Way to put the effort in, Madonna  No! 
[01:04:00]  Come on!  Give me my theme  Yeah!  Oh, you take that!  That bitch is mine!  That's what I like  Oh, yeah?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, I'm kicking ass  I'm taking broads  This is wonderful  Oh  Oh  That's what she gets 
[01:04:30]  From all that tofu  You stink  Hey you  Hey you  You're on the fence  You've got a choice  On the fence  One day  How about she turns off  Half the lights in her mansion  And you know what?  You know what?  That would  That would help  Oh  She has to  She's on the fence  She just has to be  Straddling something  Right  How about you take  A horse and buggy  Back to your mansion  I liked her better 
[01:05:00]  When she was a whore  Exactly  Bustier  With large  Yeah  Metal bosoms  With her stupid  Naked book  Her coffee table book  Go hitchhike topless  In your book again  Hey you  First love yourself  First love yourself  Or if you  I kind of got excited  Because when I heard  It was hey you  I'm thinking  Oh, she redid  Some Floyd for everything  No  No  Oh  Because you hear  Hey you  And you're like  Alright, cool  And then it's that  Hey you  Hey you  Out there in the cold 
[01:05:30]  Right  Feeling lonely  Nope  Look, people that burn fuel  Love others  I mean, you know  Exactly  Stop trying to make that connection  We hate people  Because I'm driving  Right  Stop trying to make that connection  Why are you making that  Dumb love connection  People that are burning fuel  Driving their escalades  All over the place  Probably have loving families 
[01:06:00]  And love a lot of things  Love people  Driving to work  So their loving wife  Doesn't leave them  Right  Exactly  Hey you  I hate how everything  Has to be connected  Back to the love thing  Oh, where's my thing  Oh  Leave the oil  Just walk away  I give you my word  You will not be harmed  If you leave the oil  And just walk away  Who is this humongous?  He seems like a reasonable man  And then of course  You know, humongous 
[01:06:30]  He's not reasonable  He'll tie you to the front  Of a vehicle  And then  And then rear end something  And your bloody face print  Will be on there  There you go  That's the  That's the  The earth I want  No  Our celebration  Is going on tonight  Hey you  You know  Maybe we shouldn't  Crossbow women  This could be good  Yeah  I'm on the fence  Hey you  Hey you  Where's my friend 
[01:07:00]  With the little gay guy  On the back of the motorcycle  That was a little weird  You can change someone else  And you don't save someone else  But you're my first love yourself  First love yourself  And you can save people  And then you can change someone else  So  That sounds like work  So why don't you be a leader  And turn off all the lights  In your mansion  Yeah  And refuse electricity  Don't have any pot  Just refuse electricity  And have the media  Outside your mansion  As you turn off the lights 
[01:07:30]  And say I'm never turning  Never turn them on again  I'm making a stand  I'm making a stand man  Yeah with her affected voice  I'm making a stand  That I will not use electricity  I will not use any type of power  Whatsoever  I'm making a stand  Hey Madonna  Aren't you from Detroit originally?  Yeah what happened?  What happened?  Lourdes will wear loincloths  Oh does it just go on forever? 
[01:08:00]  The Edmund Fitzgerald of earth songs  Jesus  It started as a bubbling mass  Of metal rotating around the sun  She gives a real time history of the earth  In that song  She's still singing it  A billion trillion years ago  It was something called the Big Bang 
[01:08:30]  You think they whisked her off the stage  Into her limo  That went to her private jet  Back to her mansion  Nothing but emissions  Right  Electricity that is just  Going through that mansion  Could probably like light a small village somewhere  Yeah  But she wants us to like  Make the difference  Enough  I got a phony  Little phonies  Shut up 
[01:09:00]  Oh god this dirge  Is it over?  She's waving her arms in the air  Probably left it  Everyone's lighting their lighters  And burning up more fuel  They're hoping that she uses  Like a non-electric razor  To shave her pits  Nice photo shoot  Stupid  You know  Maybe someone can help me out here  But I bet you while that song  Was being played  There was some kind of video  She loves video montages 
[01:09:30]  Video montage  And there's probably like  A video montage  Of like just  Smoke stacks  And pollution  Right  Our waterways  All polluted  And the smoke stacks  Yeah  I guarantee  She had that playing  Something dirty  From like the 30s  It was like the United States  Industrial age  From the 20s and 30s  Showing old pictures  She flies a private plane  Yeah  So shut up  Yeah  She flies a private plane  Hollywood's just full of hypocrites 
[01:10:00]  Wait she flew a crew of 100 plus  To this event  On private jets  I have a very big crew  They're all on the fence  Because I'm more important than you  I love them  She stood there with her  I sing for your enjoyment  Because you couldn't possibly  Think of this crap yourself  Ugh  Oh there's an official  Live Earth video  Ew  Oh great  There's still  Still a chance for us 
[01:10:30]  For us  U.S.  And the S is spelt with a dollar sign  And then they show a montage of us  Which is  Every type of person  You can imagine  We're a melting pot  We are  We're a  Melting pot smoke monday  What is it?

[01:20:30]  And your  Really first gig  Is in front of  10,000 people  At a virus show  Wow  I hope you know  How to work a crowd  They might be okay to them  Yeah  Because Philly is known  For being a very  They're very patient  Yes  As a city  Right  Right  Genteel  Forgiving  Yeah  Mm-hmm  YSP is doing a great job  Promoting our visit  So keep listening to YSP  For all the details  Yes 
[01:21:00]  But one of the  Well we got the  Wow motorcycle run  You know  From New York  To Philly  Where does that start  We should promote  Where that starts  And we're promoting  A lot of stuff  I'm sure Keith will call  And Keith call  But make it quick  Because we're really  Really busy today  One of the problems  With our Philly trip  Is Karen Buck  Sent out an email  Late last week  In a panic  Because the hotel  We usually stay at  Doesn't want us  Yeah  And you know  Oh I'm sorry  You can't come  So she had to find  A hotel last minute  To accommodate 
[01:21:30]  This crew  And we're thinking  What the hell  Did we even say  About this hotel  But they I guess  Either heard it themselves  Or our listeners called  Or something happened  I was reminded  That I had a problem  With room service  Yeah  That was it  And so did Jimmy  And me and him  I guess commiserated on it  And then surprisingly  Opie was told  That he said something also  And you're a little  Shocked by that  I'm very shocked  Because you're not like  A big room service guy 
[01:22:00]  It really doesn't matter to you  Me and Jimmy  Are two guys  Like late night room service  When we're in bed together  Watching a movie  Absolutely  We want a snack  Just to get that taste  Out of our mouth  What's your mouth  Taste from  Like bleach  Mine tastes like mushroom  Let's go to some food  Oh my god  My god man  My god  So  So we found the rants  Ah okay  Good  I don't think they were  That bad either  We just kind of said  Hey look  This kind of needs 
[01:22:30]  Something  I haven't heard this  But I think we said  Something along the lines  Of this needs  The room service was good  But needs something  To be desired  Like they probably  Could have improved it a bit  It was like a very mild  Discussion  Let's just put it this way  Jimmy  At this point  We need a live earth concert  To heal all the hurt  We have done over the years  All the hurt  Because we just  We just brutalize people  And then move on  To the next thing  And we don't even think  About what kind of damage  That did  It's just scorched earth policy  That's what this show is  Whatever's behind us  Is left in ruin  We just beat up this hotel  And then we move on 
[01:23:00]  With our radio show  And then we forgot  That we even beat them up  Until we need them again  And then realize  Oh boy  We need to find a new hotel  So this is Anthony's rant  There was nothing  No place open really  To go to  Like a diner or something  So we all just said  Screw it  Go back to our  Respective rooms  And get room service  Which was still  Open until what?  It was supposed to be open  Until 3 o'clock  On Saturday night  Saturday night  So we get back at  Do you remember  One something 
[01:23:30]  We have 1  1.30  I know I ordered it  Around this sometimes  Yeah that's about  When I ordered  Me and my girlfriend  Order  And we're waiting  Waiting  Bah  Fall asleep  We fall asleep  Which isn't hard to do  After a day like that  But didn't wake up  From a knock on the door  From a telephone ringing  Or anything else  They just never brought  The room service  Alright so why are they mad  If we're just telling the truth  Yeah  Absolutely  Why are they mad  If we're just telling the truth  I've dozed off a few times  Waiting for room service 
[01:24:00]  And then  You get the knock on the door  Or the  Ding  Dong  Say  Hello  Mr. Kumia  Where would you like this  Just put it there  Don't touch it  Don't stick your friggin  Nasty gnarly finger  In the top hole  Of the tin thing  Over my plate  Cause you're gonna  Touch my sandwich  I hate when they do that  When they wheel that in  I want them to leave it alone  I want them to just  Get it  I'll sign it  Leave  Don't take the plastic  Off my soup  Leave the plastic  On the soup  The big long 
[01:24:30]  Nasty fingernails  With dirt under them  And he's prying up  The plastic  For my soup  I gotta eat that  You're turning into  Howard Hughes man  It's not that big of a deal  No  It's a big deal  And then they stick  Here's your dessert  They put the finger  You know how they got  The little hole  In the tin thing  That covers your plate  They put their finger  In there  Lift it off  And go  Here's your dessert  And there's a big  Fingerprint  Now on your dessert  Cause he stuck  His Nosferatu  Finger  Through that  God damn hole  You hope they use 
[01:25:00]  Their finger  I had a Nigerian  Do it with his hands  Above his head  It's a very impressive  Sure  Got a big tip  Well that's what  You gave him  Exactly  A fireman's helmet  Printing my mashed potatoes  So you didn't like  The room service  We should have said  No to them  Before they were able  To say no to us  Yes  Now we look stupid  And then Jimmy  You ordered at 1.30  1.30 the order goes in  2.30  Nothing has come  So I call down  And the retard  Who answers the phone  Goes I just kind of  Wow  Okay Jimmy 
[01:25:30]  You called him a retard  Maybe they have a point  Well I made a point here  This was the Sobatel  This is by the way  This is  It's a nice hotel  Nine months ago  Yeah  This is  Ten months ago  I think it was after  Ten months ago  Yeah  Whatever  Yeah this is a nice hotel  I mean anyone that waits  An hour before they  Bring your roast  That's a four star  Joint in my book  I love how we have  No memories of this  By the way  Cause when Karen Buck  Sent that email out  I'm like  What did we do to them  What did we say  You heard ants rant  You hear Jimmy 
[01:26:00]  Calling him retarded  Retarded  That might have been  Maybe I justify it here  I honestly don't remember  What I said  Retard  Who answers the phone  Goes I just kind of  Realized that I  Misplaced your paper  I don't have the paper  So what was your order again  And I'm like  You haven't even  Started it  And he goes no  So I give him the order again  And I remember the beverage  Was club soda  With a splash of cranberry  So he goes alright  It'll be about a half hour  And I'm like  Wait a minute  Can't you prioritize it  And put it at the head  Of the line  Right  Since they screwed you up 
[01:26:30]  And he goes  Well we're really backed up  25 minutes later  Because they close at 3  I call like 3 minutes to 3  And I call the manager  And she goes down  To see what happens  She calls me back  After 3  And she goes  They're cooking it now  It'll be another 20 minutes  And I'm glad that  It wasn't her problem  She was nice  But the guy who took the order  I'm glad he wasn't there  Because I would have bitten him  I would have physically  Yeah  Just bite him  Finally my food comes up  Two hours later  And the only reason  I knew it came up  Is because  The retard  Who took the order 
[01:27:00]  Forgot the order  Then made me wait for the order  Brought the food up  And knocked on the door next door  I heard the faint  Oh my god  It was like this  So I'm like  He's either knocking  At another door  Or there's an age patient  Delivering our food  I open the door  He bumbles in  With his stupid beard  He apologized  I couldn't  I couldn't look at him  And he looked  I was sulking  And if anybody  Knows anybody  At the Sofatel in Philly  Maybe you can figure out why  We didn't get our beverage  With a splash of cranberry  Wow that was good rant Jimmy 
[01:27:30]  Well you know what  It's hard to see it their way  I think  Yeah  I don't  I see it my way  Who wants to stay in that dump  Bring me my food stupid  Poor Karen Buck  She had to call these people  She had no idea  That this went on  The retard  We need four rooms  Absolutely not  Good  The more I think of that  The more I am so happy  What I'm saying  It makes me angry again  It was the worst  Room service situation 
[01:28:00]  All you want to do  Is eat and go to bed  And get up  That's it  That's all you want to do  And I'm sure you  I think you did chime in  With something  You're saying you didn't  But I think you did  It's right here  I love the Sofatel  That bed was really comfortable  Yeah the bed was fantastic  When you're laying there  At 5am  With a fat stomach  Full of food  That you should have eaten  Two hours ago  So it beats sleeping on the sidewalk  Like I have been  Being a homeless shock jock  That bed was very very comfortable  Pillow top  That was a pillow top  Yeah it was very good  I'm going to get one of those 
[01:28:30]  Yes it was a lovely hotel  Eventually get my pad  Two nights in a row  I had to call security  Because of the spoiled rich kids  In the room next to me  Making noise  So if you like  Not getting your food  For two hours  And then spoiled rich kids  Making noise  In the room next door  Feel free  The Sofatel is for you  Oh my god  Just beating them off man  And I meant it stupid  And if they would have  Just let us stay there  This time we would have  Forgotten about it  Right  Never would have thought  We'd have been in there  Going oh this place is nice  Dopes  Yeah we're idiots 
[01:29:00]  We don't remember  We're like goldfish  I can't remember  The memories of goldfish  Yeah  And Ope  Ope is like  Ope is like one of the Jews  On the holocaust  That they got to help the Nazis  Oh no I kind of like them  Yeah  The top was lovely  Yeah but I remember  Ope is a trustee  I was homeless though  At this point  So anything was good to me  And then Kenny gets involved  Well I also do have  A room service story  You know after working  13 hours that day  And not having dinner  I went back to my room  And I ordered a burger 
[01:29:30]  And a bottle of water  Turned on Saturday Night Live  And fell asleep  An hour later I woke up  And I knew I wouldn't sleep  Through the knock  So I called downstairs  I go where's my food  They go it's on it's way up  Right now  An hour later  Yeah  When they promise you  Like 20 to 30 minutes  Yeah  They suck  So 10 minutes go by  Knock on the door  The guy comes in  I go what took so long  For my food  He goes we delivered it  To the wrong room  And as he's bringing it in  I see my check on top  And somebody signed my check  I go what do you mean 
[01:30:00]  You delivered it  To the wrong room  Did they touch my food  And the guy's like  I don't know  I go you don't know  I don't want it  Not Kenny  Yeah  Oh you you  That must have driven you crazy  Just the thought  This jackass  Probably got a call  From that room  And said we got the wrong food  He came back up  And brought it to you  Yeah  Yeah  Instead of immediately  Bringing it back downstairs  And just re-cooking it  Some nasty hands on it  Going this isn't my burger  Like touching it  Yeah  Flipping it over  Seeing if it has  What he ordered on it  No mine's got bacon on it  No 
[01:30:30]  Yeah so he goes  I'll cook you another one  I go it's 3.30 in the morning  I gotta go to sleep  Yeah  You know  So I said just forget it  So I pick up the phone  Call downstairs  I go is the manager on duty  I explain the whole story  To her like I just did now  And she goes  Oh that's totally unacceptable  I go I know  That's why I'm calling you  So she goes  What would you like me to do  I go what can you do  It's 3.30 in the morning  She goes what would you like me to do  I go I shouldn't pay  For my hotel room tonight  She goes okay  I go oh alright thanks  Goodbye click 
[01:31:00]  Free hotel room for the night  And believe  Wow  Well they gave you  Free room there Kenny  Yeah  Can I say I got the same  Offer from her  What can I do to make it  And I said nothing  I was like Malcolm X  Walking into that college  When the little white girl  Right up and said  Mr. X what can I do  To help your cause  Nothing  Nothing  That's exactly what I told  The woman you can do  To fix this  Nothing  Nothing  Unless murder the idiot  In the room service  Is an option  I just have to bring up  Once again  That we have no  Recollection of this  Whatsoever 
[01:31:30]  I'm starting to remember  I was a bit annoyed  With the room service  But  Because I read this email  Like the sofa  Tell doesn't want us back  What  What is this about  We must have  Yeah we must have  Thrown something through a wall  Yeah yeah  No no  Here's the final rant  And I get  I get a little more  Heated  In this equation  Everybody got their  Room service  Screwed up then  Wow that was ugly  Wow  Wow that was an ugly rant  What happened  I sure went off there  What happened E-Rock  It's still playing 
[01:32:00]  Nothing's going on  We're back live  Oh E-Rock  What happened E-Rock  I was having trouble  With that last track  I'll load it  I bet you were  Alright  But you put it out anyway  E-Rock will do it  He'll get it done  He's a good boy  Oh well  Don't make a fool out of me Eric  Too late  I bet you Preston and Steve  Don't have dead air  No  Everything's planned  The hole goes  Tee hee hee  And then the next track plays  And then they go into  A phony phone call  Phony phone call 
[01:32:30]  And then they give out  Their rush tickets  And then a song parody  Before break  All perfectly timed out  Here's the final rant  On the Sofitel  Down there in Philly  Everybody got their room service  Screwed up that night  Yeah they gave me free  My room service was free  Two hours  And I told her  I was mentioning it on the air  And I kind of love  Slash hate yanking that card  But I told her  Remember  On Monday  That this happened 
[01:33:00]  I want you to remember  She was very nice  It was  The retard  Yeah  Working there  I could not believe  That it wasn't us  I thought  Oh my god  We passed out  And slept through the knock  They'd never call  Like I'm thinking  If you knock on the door  And no one answers  And they called room service  You would call the room  Right  Right  And say hey  Your food's ready  They never came with it  How long are you supposed to wait  For food and club soda  With a splash of cranberry 
[01:33:30]  Well you know  Normally the Sofitel  Is a good hotel  That's why I put  Is it  I put people there  I've been there many times  I like the place  I gotta be honest with you  It had to be like  A new retarded room service guy  Yeah  Alright well there you go  Good evening  Good evening  Good evening  Good evening  And there you go  That's the reason  Right there  Why we're not  Invited back to the Sofitel  In Philly  Good we should have  Remembered it  Not when  They have no sense of humor  Keep listening to WISP

[01:36:00]  Slightly scolded  By our  New program director  Tracy  Because he was  Poking his head out  No one ever  I don't know what he was doing  He was perusing the hallway  Yeah he says he was  Just asking the question  He was reading the hallway  Perusing  Slightly browsing  With his eyes  Right  The way he'll  The way he'll peruse  The front of the sailor's pants  When he walks in  And Tracy  I think  Told him to stick  His fat head back in there  And do something  So I'm like  Well did she look good  What is she wearing  That's all I care about  Yeah  And he's like 
[01:36:30]  She's wearing like  An orange top  And like brown skirt  And Kenny goes  It's green shorts  Green shorts  I'm like dude  How off are you  She's wearing a brown skirt  How can you be that off  I wasn't really looking at her  I got it out the side of my eye  All I saw was orange  I thought it was a brown skirt  Turns out it was a space suit  So what are you saying  She's not a looker  What are you trying to say  Yeah you weren't looking at her  What's wrong with you  I was doing something else  I did not look directly at her  Alright well  Alright well you got her way off  Hey can you say sperm  On the radio these days 
[01:37:00]  I would hope so  All depends  Eric will be thirsty if you can't  Now in that context  No  No you wrecked it  Why  Jimmy  You wrecked it on me  Just an observation  Because it is Pot Talk Monday  Pot Talk Monday  It's also Sometimes Monday  And we got your feel good story  Of the day  Because you know  It's feel good story Monday  We're going to play that  In a few minutes here  But can you  Sure  Can you say the old  Sperm word  On the radio  Yeah  Anthony had a great observation  They were showing  Hmm 
[01:37:30]  They were showing sperm cells  Sperm cells  Yeah they were doing  Some kind of a news story  On I guess fertility  I don't even know  What the story was about  Don't even care  But we look at the screen  And Than pointed out  Now we're all just  Trying to push it on  Other people who first noticed it  Than goes  Ooh sperm  And we had a turn and look  And you know what  But when you see that on TV  It just makes you kind of giggle  Ah you gotta giggle  Little tadpoles  Yeah  Waka waka waka 
[01:38:00]  But that's what it was  It was sperm cells  Just bumping into each other  Trying to figure out  What they're supposed to be doing  Swimming around  You know  They really don't know  What they're doing  Nah  Just one of those little  What  They might look like  They don't know  What they're doing  They have no  But they know exactly  What they're doing  They have no clue  One little fella  Luck's out  Getting you in trouble  One lucky fella  You know what it's like  To collide with an egg though  The two things  Of such small size like that 
[01:38:30]  My goodness  There's a lot of luck involved  There's no  There's no brain power being used  You would like there to be  You know  You want that one sperm cell  That just is very smart  Very athletic  Working his way up  But he's duking it out  With the rest  And right down the middle  Sometimes two smart ones  Are fighting out  And the Mo Howard wig  Sperm makes it through  What's this  Slow and steady  Wins the race  Congratulations 
[01:39:00]  It's a disappointment  Yeah  That'll happen  A family photo wrecker  Yeah  That's it  But  The observation was  That  They were showing it  On television  Yeah  Now we've seen this a lot  Fertility stories  Or  Documentaries  Discovery Channel  Whatever  You see  Sperm cells swimming  And I'm starting to think 
[01:39:30]  What's the rule  As far as television goes  With like the FCC  Or something  It's still  What it is  It's  Sperm cells  But  It all depends  On how close  You look at it  Which is odd  To me  Like  I also have an observation  Quickly  That  They can show  Dead people  As long as  They're dead people  From far away  Not far away  Camera wise  But a far away land  Like halfway around the globe  Show us dead people  But we don't like 
[01:40:00]  Showing dead people here  You know  Like a car crash  Or an explosion  They won't show that  But they'll show  Dead like brown people  Halfway around the world  That's cool  They don't care  Sperm  You can show  While it's in  It's swimmy little  You know  Sperm cell thing  But pull that camera back  How far back  Does that camera  Have to go  Before it's unacceptable  Before you cannot  Show it on TV anymore  It's the same stuff  As what you can't  Possibly show 
[01:40:30]  On television  I think  It's a fertility story  Can you imagine  They zoom out  And it's  Let's just put it this way  All of a sudden  There's a porn star  On your TV  Right  And you're like  What happened here  It's like  How far do you have  To zoom out  And pull that  Camera back  Before the outrage  Before they go  Hey hey hey  Hey hey whoa  Hey wait a minute  What are you doing  Hey Jim  I'll tell you how far back  You have to pull the camera  You pull the camera back  Far enough where you're  And the one goes  Ah that's better  We got the

[01:47:30]  Maybe not an idiot  He got away with it  They're still trying  To find the tree guy  He disguised himself  As a tree  Alright  And robbed a bank  He walked in  The bank as a tree  Surprised Billy Joel  Didn't drive into him  Another Billy Joel joke  Funny  Alright  He made it out  Good for him  Yeah  Dressed as a tree  So make your tree jokes  At home  They made the good one  With the limb  He went out on a limb  Yeah that was a good one  I get it  Yeah yeah  Oh that's cool  And uh

Less than two weeks now  Huh?  Yep  A week from  A week from this coming Saturday  Yes  Damn  And I think we're going to have  A special announcement  That has something to do with  Like the military  Good  I think we're taking care  Of the military  At the next ONA Travel and Virus  Comedy Show  What?  I don't have the details  In front of me  I think we're supposed  To announce that today  Are we going to Iraq?  No, no, no, no

[01:52:00]  And just wave everyone through  Everyone gets through  On ONA day  I went to  This thing at UCB  Last night  The Upright Citizens Brigade  They do brilliant improv  I really laughed  Watching them  And Horatio Sands  From SNL  Goes down there  And does a lot of stuff  On Sunday nights  And he's going to Iraq  With somebody else  And I was like  Yeah, I was there  And I'm like  I think it was a lot safer  When I was there  Because he's obviously  Nervous  Which was the wrong way to say  Yeah, yeah  I think you're right though  Where do they fly?  Like how do they fly you in? 
[01:52:30]  Like what if you go down?  I mean they're beheading people  It's just very scary  To have your plane  Possibly go down there  That would suck  If you had to make  An emergency landing  In the country  Yes  But not near  The green zone  Yes  Because then you're like  Okay  Well I'm sure  The auto club  Should be coming by soon  Right  With their machetes  Oh that would be horrible  They fly you on  You'd be like  Please die in the crash  Please die in the crash  They fly you on C-130s 
[01:53:00]  And it's very frightening man  Like you think  You can get shot down  As a civilian  Yeah  You know  You won't be traveling  In a convoy  Like all these contractors  Crazy people  There's no guarantees  There's no guarantees  That you can make  An in or out of there  When you go in  To entertain  You know  A lot of entertainers  Over the years  Who was that?  Benny Goodman I think  I think Benny Goodman died  His plane was shot down  Is that how he died?  Oh yeah  I'm pretty sure  Benny Goodman  I think the Nazis  Got Benny Goodman  I think they shot his plane down 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  Over the channel  I didn't know that  Yeah  I'm pretty sure  It was Benny Goodman  Was it not happening  I'm sure Steve from Bayshore  That closet Nazi  He'll be able to  He'll tell me  Yeah  I gotta say good luck to Sean  Speaking of Iraq  I know a guy  I was down in Philly  They're sending him back to Iraq  He had his foot  Everyone that's been  That's gone there  And comes home  Goes back  This kid got a purple heart  This kid had his heel  Pretty much blown off  Had to go through  Extensive rehab  And they patched him up 
[01:54:00]  He got to  You know  Hang out in America  For eight to nine months  And they're sending him back  Even though his first tour  Was done  Didn't that used to mean  Like you went home  And then  And that was it  That was it  You were done  No now they're  They're sending people back  So all these families  That you know  They're not sleeping  For the twelve to eighteen months  And they  And they get through it  And they  They welcome their sons  Or daughters home  Yeah  And there's a huge sigh of relief  Like wow  My child made it  Made it  Yeah  Well sorry  Gotta go back 
[01:54:30]  And you're  And you're thinking  That's it  You know  You don't have to send  Your child back  You know  They're still in the military  But they're gonna be  Doing something else  Oh no  They're sending them back  And now these families  Have to worry all over again  Just amazing  That really is  Just amazing  That you go  Oh Glenn Miller  They're saying  Oh is it Glenn Miller  Okay Glenn Miller  I knew it was one of them  Get the story  So there were a couple things  That's why I wasn't sure  Of the name  I was like  Well one of those  Oldie time  Yeah yeah 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  Horrible news coming in  As Benny Goodman  Is not shot down  Wait a minute  Who got shot down  Glenn Miller  Glenn Miller  Glenn Miller's plane  Has been lost  Oh my goodness gracious  Oh the humanity  Oh gee there it is  And he's gone  What did he play  Maybe this  I don't know  Do we even know or care  They don't care out there  That's all that matters  Looks like the Nazis  Wasted some ammo on him 
[01:55:30]  Yes then  You got something on this  Just that this  Is Glenn Miller  And it's in the mood  Yes  His big hit  That's a famous one  His big hit  I'm glad they shot him down  This song stinks  Alright this is  This is  You know  One you get to play  For the old people  At the wedding  Sounds like the ones  That they're in  Awakenings  That they were all  Dancing to before  They fell back to sleep  I feel swindled  So do I  I paid for this  Awful moment  Good concept though 
[01:56:00]  It's a slow news day  CNN is discussing  The funeral for the N-word  Yeah yeah  I saw somebody up there  Talking about it  The NAACP  Doing some heavy  Heavy lifting today  I gotta tell ya  Yeah well  They're having a funeral  For the N-word  And we can't get  Enough of that  It's the real issues  Out there  That are facing  The black community  Words  That's what you gotta  Deal with  Words  Because words hurt  Words hurt  And then our program  Director points out  That Russell Simmons 
[01:56:30]  Was  Who's on Oprah  When I miss  Screws up  Yep  You know how wrong it is  And then he's on Bill Maher  Dropping the N-bomb  Uh huh  It's like oh alright  It's okay  It's okay for you  It's okay for you  Country's losing its mind  I was  I want to play this again  Really fast  We don't  We're kind of discussing  This behind the scenes  We really don't know  What to do with this yet  We know there's something  Something here  We had a  You know  A couple news anchors  A black news anchor  And um  I don't know what  What she is  But she's of  Of something 
[01:57:00]  I don't know  She's got something  Going on  A melting pot  But uh  They covered the redneck games  On the news this morning  And they thought  It was completely acceptable  To just do the  Stereotypical  Redneck voice  Southern  Redneck  Yeah  You know  Uneducated  White  Person  Redneck  Marrying your relative  Stereotype  It's a black guy doing it  Yeah  Yeah  And the black people  Seem to be the sensitive ones  These days  Yeah  So why is this guy  Able to go on the news 
[01:57:30]  And just do  And honestly  We don't care  We don't  But if you're gonna like  You know  Make a big deal  Out of Mr. Imus  Saying what he did  When he was just  Trying to entertain somebody  And his 35 year career  Is ruined  But then you turn around  And you get  A black news guy  Doing the redneck voice  Doing the redneck imitation  And now one person  Has called today  To explain why  It's okay  Jimmy had explained it  To everybody  That's right  There's a double standard  No outrage  Why don't we all just admit  Like I think  Jimmy brought this up  Back when the whole 
[01:58:00]  Imus thing was going on  Why don't we all just admit  There's a double standard  And then we can move on  Yeah  It's okay to make fun of Whitey  Whitey's the easy target  And the corporations  Like people like know this  The guys behind the scenes  In all these businesses  Know this  And they accept it  Yeah they accept it  They're guilt ridden  They're older  They're 58  65 years old  They feel guilty  So they throw that crap on us  It just shows weakness  When a group has to  You know get so outraged  And march  And do all this stuff 
[01:58:30]  I see a weakness there  I think  Because the reality is  That every group out there  Makes fun of other groups  It doesn't matter  If you're Asian  Puerto Rican  Black  You're making fun of  Other groups  It's just how it is  And it's how it'll always be  I also think  There are more important things  Than facing  Each individual community  Out there  Than what they're  Most publicized for  You know  Like you see  Reverend Al  Whenever  Somebody says 
[01:59:00]  Something bad  You know  He's always there  There are so many  Other issues  That need to be addressed  In his community  If you wanted to be  A real  Real leader  But  That's not popular  In the community  So  He doesn't do that  He goes for the sound bite  The quick sound bite  And the easy target  Like Imus  Things like that  Well listen to this  And just  You know  Why is this acceptable  But like  Let's just say  The Imus thing wasn't  Seriously  Yeah  And nothing  Says summer 
[01:59:30]  Like fun in the sun  Hey boy I tell you  You know  In Dublin Jordan  That's a black guy  Hey boy I tell you  Reving up his  Deep southern  Redneck  That redneck twang  Impression  And he's on a show  That's not even  Perceived as  As comedy  No  Like when Imus  Did what he did  It was in the name  Of comedy  So let's say that  Now their excuse  Would be well  The redneck festival  Was kind of a parody  Of that  So we were just  Playing off the parody  But  If black people  Did some kind of 
[02:00:00]  I mean they have  Things that play off  Of black stereotypes  Yeah  And a white reporter  Went on and went  How y'all doing  Oh my god  Can you imagine  You couldn't touch it  You'd be in such  Big trouble  You'd be in Dutch  Oh  Boy I tell you  You know  In Dublin, Georgia  They kicked off  The redneck games  Gotta love them  Yep you heard right  It's called  The redneck games  Thousands celebrated  Don't be confused  Because we're  Broadcasting to  A big part of this country  Yeah  This isn't a 
[02:00:30]  Southern news guy  No  He's here in New York  We actually played him  Doing another story  Earlier where  He was doing the story  On the funeral  For the n-word  Using his just  Normal voice  He's a young urbanite  Right  But yeah  Don't be confused  He put on this  Southern redneck  Twang  For the story  Right  It's called  The redneck games  Thousands celebrated  With activities  Such as  Bobbing for pig's feet  Mud pit belly flop  Contest  Steve spitting at a course  And armpit serenade 
[02:01:00]  That's where people  Married to their sister  Price of admission  Was five dollars  For adults  And enjoying  An armpit serenade  Priceless  Can you give me  An armpit serenade  Oh there you are  That's funny right there  Get her done  You gonna give me  An armpit serenade  Uh no  Not today  Maybe later  They're doing  Stereotype humor  That's all  But if a white guy  Does stereotype humor  That has something to do  With a black person  Then there's an outrage  And you should be fired  And your life 
[02:01:30]  Should be ruined  As a white guy  In his suit  Will tell ya  White people have been  The oppressors  I mean  Until black  Until white people  Complain  It's okay  Don't you understand  That you're part  Of the problem  Don't you understand  That  They never will  There will be no outrage  For this  Cause it was  Making fun of whitey  No  It just amazes me  Whitey stinks  White people  Yeah  They really do  I hate whitey  Just amazes me  Uh  Anthony  This first 48 
[02:02:00]  Ah  You got me hooked  On a show  Cause uh  Now  I caught up  With Rescue Me  Yep  I had the first  Three seasons  Box set  Thing there  And now I'm up  To the new season  So I need a new show  Cause now I have to wait  In between episodes  That's insane  In this day and age  I know  You don't do it  You just stock up  And then  When are we gonna get  To the festival  When are we gonna get  To the day  Where the new season  Of your favorite show  Comes out  Like let's say  Rescue Me  And all of a sudden  They just  Throw it all on the TV  They should  They should just do it  That way  And then you watch it 
[02:02:30]  You're leisure  At your leisure  Because now  You know  As soon as you get  Hooked on doing  Marathons  Your own marathons  Of a TV show  Now  I'm sitting there  Like wait  I have to wait a week  To find out what  Happens on Rescue Me  Now  No  It's stupid  I can't just like  Get up  Take a leak  Come back down  You know  Come back  Come back  Into the living room  And play the next episode  That's how it should be  But anyway  I need a new show  Cause I'm done  Seeing  Well  I spent the weekend  With a little marathon  Of my own  Because I guess 
[02:03:00]  The new season  Is starting  This week  Of the first 48  This is the first 48 hours  In the investigation  Of a homicide  Hold on  I really apologize  Cause now we're getting  Someone that's gonna  Attempt to explain  This I miss  And redneck thing  Sorry Anthony  Tim in Jersey  Tim  Hey what's up guys  Hey  The uh  It's wrong to make fun  Of people  Like the way they talk  Or something  And this guy was wrong  For making a generalization  Like that 
[02:03:30]  The difference between  Him and Imus  Is Imus went after  A specific group  Of young women  Who instead of  Being celebrated  For their accomplishments  Were being called  A bunch of nappy headed hoes  And being called  Tough looking chicks  When they got  To like  They were the second  Best women's basketball  Team in the country  So wait hold on  Sorry so you're saying  That  Hold on  So you're saying  That wait a minute  That the difference is  Like that woman said  Sleeping like  Marrying your sister  So because these women  Were good at a sport  Because they were good 
[02:04:00]  At throwing a ball  Through a hole  Uh  The rules are  A little different  For them  I didn't say  The rules are different  I said that  Imus and his producer  Whatever the moron's  Name was  They made a specific  Bernard Garkin  He's brilliant  Yeah he's not a moron  He's actually very brilliant  And does a very good job  Uh  Producing a radio show  So you do see a difference  Between the two cases  You don't just look at one  Uh  Attempting to be humorous  With a stereotype  And another 
[02:04:30]  Attempting to be humorous  With a stereotype  It's  It's  They're not  They're not the same  Really  Do you understand that  Most people don't care  About women's college  Basketball to begin with  And most people  Didn't even realize  That Rutgers was in the finals  Until Imus  Uh  Made his little  Attempt as humor  And then all of a sudden  We're like  Oh wow  They  Oh I didn't even know  They were in the finals  And oh look  Look at all their accomplishments  Let me ask you something sir  Was it really  The fact that he was making  Why is he hanging up  Don't hang up 
[02:05:00]  Is he there  No  He hung up  Um  Oh  Because I  My point was  I don't think that  I think the fact that he was targeting  That group of women  Is just the excuse  Everybody used  To pile on  Yeah  Well they were a group  So what  Group of ugly broads  Big deal  What do you think  I've never seen a hot female athlete  Who didn't play tennis  Oh yeah  Well  I'd bang all the tennis players  Except for that Billie Jean King  She wouldn't have it  She looks like McCartney 
[02:05:30]  God almighty  Can you stop with the dyed hair  Dude  I cannot look anywhere  I go into like Starbucks  Yeah  And that god damn McCartney poster  You wrecked it for everybody  Is up there  And all I do is start laughing  Not because of him  Doing that stupid pose  That McCartney's doing  On the cover of his new album  But I look  I think of you  Imitating him doing that pose  And I laugh  Because he's holding his lapels  And his lips are percy  And fistable  And they're all wrinkled  Of course  It looks like an anus 
[02:06:00]  He's 78  Yeah  And his hands are holding his lapels  And he's peeking  And he's got like a look on his face  Like  Like Heather's pants just came off  She's  She's only got one  One leg  And he's just  It's like  You're not a younger man  Yeah  You have kajagoogoo hair  And the trite  Oh listen to this  You dribble  Oh look at the video  Like he's all cartoony  You think Lennon would have been  Making songs like this  If he survived  Playing a ukulele 
[02:06:30]  Who wrote this  His retarded nephew  All right and tonight  That was like great 1981  It's catchy  It's not catchy  So is AIDS  I don't want to sing about it  Everybody gonna dance around tonight  Snap man from whack bag  Using that logic  We can't make fun of the president  Because he won the presidency  Speaking of that guy's  You know  Argument  Just a bunch of dopey  Guilty white people 
[02:07:00]  In suits  Well white people  Were always the oppressors  I know stupid  Stop feeling guilty for it  You weren't the oppressor  Let's go to Craig in Philly  Craig what's up  Hey guys how you doing  Hey sweetie pie  I don't understand why people don't get it  That line that that female reporter  If you hear what she said  She said that's where they're married to their sister  Yeah  That's no different than the line that I'm just saying  Of course it's not  Well that's how I see it  You're right  I'll tell you the difference  But people will attempt to explain why it's different  Black people  Asian people  They don't feel guilty  They're not guilt ridden superiority complex idiots 
[02:07:30]  Like white people are  That's the problem  Yeah  And that's the difference  Back to McCartney's song  It's  Dinks  In the video he's dancing  And there's like colors  Yeah it's supposed to look like some  It's a very yellow submarine-ish color  So he's trying to like  Get some of that retro Beatles look to it  And it just doesn't work  But he's saying like  Everything is going to be alright  We're going to dance around tonight  Tonight  Like there's a room full of people  Just dancing around in a circle 
[02:08:00]  And everything is good  Everybody wang chung tonight  Well here we go  This is trite drivel  Everybody gonna dance around  There we go  He's walking around the house  Trying to find dancers  Of course he is  He's just getting a bag  And he's putting all the unused left shoes in it  Why would we want to  If all you're going to do is  Exactly  Make us dance  And do what  Eat veggie burgers  Right  Small veggie burger farts  We heard you 
[02:08:30]  He's just going through the house  Looking for dancers  Who wants to dance with me  Are there ghosts in his house  Yeah there's ghosts  What are they  Like John Lennon  An old pudding head  It's John George and Linda going  Did you write this crap  Whistles  Alright let's go to Gorilla Bob in Jersey  Her slips  Whistle  Gorilla Bob  What's up  Hey there Gorilla Bab  Gorilla Bob  Love the show  Love you  Love the show  I think that we should 
[02:09:00]  I think that we should write letters of support  To Channel 11  We should tell them how much we support this stereotype humor  No matter how much other people are protesting  We really go for it  No no one's going to protest  And you know  We think this stuff should be all over the place  So we're in a weird position  We can't really protest it  Yeah I don't want to protest it  Because you know who cares  We want to go back to doing our stereotypical humor  There's nothing wrong with it  Our problem is not with the Channel 11 guy 
[02:09:30]  It's more like guys like Al Roker  Who's kind of like a self-righteous piggy  You know couldn't stop shoving food into his fat face  Had his stomach stapled  Now he wants to be poignant  Because he thinks he's thin  And yet he makes epilepsy jokes  Which are funny by the way  Because if you have epilepsy  And you fall down  I'm happy  See now you'll get in trouble  Yeah what are they going to do  Write a letter  No one will be able to read it  Shaky hands  Let's go to Rich in Connecticut  Rich  Yeah hey guys  I just wanted to  You're getting an email  XL XL question mark period 
[02:10:00]  Sorry man  Sorry we're a little  Go ahead Rich  Yeah I just wanted to rebut  What that gentleman was saying  About Don Imus  And then the other comments  Yeah  You know you grow up hearing the word  Wigger and honky  And white boy  And it's  You know  Never bothered me before  But if they're going to fire Imus  Over saying  Nappy headed hoes  Which isn't even really  A racially charged remark  You know  Then I'm going to start taking  Some serious offense  On my end then  Alright man  It doesn't make any sense 
[02:10:30]  You're rich from Connecticut  You're not going to take  Offense to anything  Absolutely  We just  There's no gathering the troops  There's not  It just doesn't work  You know when that whole  Imus thing went down  Honestly I tried to  Like understand  Yeah  Still lost  Yeah  Still trying to understand that  I try to look from the other side  And go maybe my views are  It's just silly  Just silly  Yeah  Bunch of  Just a  Bunch of frightened white people  I just want to retire quietly  I don't have any problems  Every group out there 
[02:11:00]  Wants to make fun of  Other groups that are  Different than  You just do  Yeah  I  I had the misfortune  Really fast  Because we were running out  Of a show here  I was out on Long Island  Had to take a train  Back to the city  I got in the first car  Because I just wanted  To be left alone  It was like a Sunday  I just wanted to be by myself  With my dumb  Tiger Woods PSP  Game there  And also  A stereotypical  Just think of  Just put the image 
[02:11:30]  In your head  Stereotypical gay guy  Comes into the car  And all of a sudden  He  Comes into the car?  Well you know  Into the train  Oh train  Into your car  I swear I missed  The first part of that  Oh okay  And you know  There was a stop  And he comes on the train  With like this couple  Just a regular  You know  Straight couple  And the  Stereotypical gay guy  Goes no  I'm saving all these seats  In this  In this particular car  And I'm like  Oh my god  What the heck  Is this about  And I learned later 
[02:12:00]  That it was the  Gay pride parade  So the whole car  Was filled with  With gay guys  Going into the city  For the parade  And I have two options  Do I  Do I  Get up and leave  Because I'm uncomfortable  Or do I sit there  And maybe  You know  Take this in  And observe a little  Which I like to do  Right  Did you take it in?  Oh boy  Did I Jimmy  Boy did I  I was proud  And  You trained  With a bunch  Of gay guys  Is that what  You're trying to say?  Yeah  On a train  Thank god  I brought this up 
[02:12:30]  With two minutes  Left of the show  Have fun for two minutes  And then  I'm gonna forget  I even said this  And for the next  Forty minutes  These gay guys  Were making fun of  Blacks  Asian  Stereotypical  Italian  Straight guys  That might work  In a machine shop  Banging broads  Doing the voices  And I'm sitting there  Like look  What line was it?  The chocolate choo choo  Did you press the button  Pull the chain?  I had something to say  You're making a mockery of it 
[02:13:00]  You sure did  It was  But it opened my mind  Because I'm  Looking at these gay guys  Just making fun of everybody  Just like we would  If we were on that same train  Right  It's like  They don't feel like  They're the weaker  Like species  Or the weaker  Group or what have you  They're sitting there  You know  Trying to do the  Straight guy voice  You know  Banging broads  Working at the  At the  You know  Down at the  What?

[02:14:00]  They don't look at themselves  Like they're weaker  Than straight guys  Or black guys  Or what have you  Three simple words  I am gay  Oh forget it  We'll just go back  To the dick jokes  Here's what it sounded like  When someone tried to  Come in through the caboose  Long Island Road  Have a caboose  It was a real eye opener 
[02:14:30]  Oh well  When I closed it  It was a real eye gluer  It was an eye opener  You had gay guys  Making fun of straight guys  Because they weren't gay  Yeah  Just how it is  And they were the majority  In that train  Right  Some of them had nice legs  Huh  I bet you some of them  Had some nice legs  Oh boy do they Jimmy  All in shape  Yeah  Little leather vest 
[02:15:00]  Ash like chap  The village people on the train  Exactly  Construction worker  A cop who says he's not gay  They were even making fun of another  They were even making fun of another gay guy  That had really really really short jean shorts on  No hair on his legs  Long hair  And a tiny little tank top  They just beat the hell out of the guy  As soon as he left the train  I'm sure it wasn't a girl  Look at that  No hair  They're all yelling 
[02:15:30]  Yucky  God didn't finish making her  Oh look at all these caboose jokes  Coming in  Of course  Oh forget it  Last time I shared with you freaks  Alright we're out of here  If you're not joining us over at XM  Have a great day  Right  Yeah and we'll see you  In Philly  Wednesday  Yes  Yeah if you're in the Philly area  Keep listening to YSP  They got all the details on our trip  Okay  Roy Roy  And we'll make out with Jill Nicolini tomorrow  On television  Oh dude  Yeah Jimmy's gonna be a mod  On

[02:16:30]  Choo choo  All aboard the man train  Yeah  John from New York  Opium had something to say  It started with  And ended with gulp  Don from Connecticut  Oh John that's not polite  Kevin from Marblehead  Opium might have been in the first car  But he was taking it in the caboose  Yeah  Uh  Redding  From Wackbag  Opium you were taking it all in  I guess you really had fun with that  Gay guy  Oh it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on 
[02:17:00]  Chris from Monroe New York  Guys  I'm a long time Rutgers fan  And the Imus comment  I could care less about  But as a young Caucasian male  I find the redneck stereotype very offensive  I don't eat mayo in excess  Or am sexually attracted to my relatives  Ridiculous  Nothing will happen to that news guy though  Doesn't matter  Hey did you uh  Did you give up your seat for one of those passengers? 
[02:17:30]  It's the play on words  I'm trying to move on  Please  Please help me  Please help me  Please  Please help me  Help me  Please help me  Help me  Please  Uh no it wasn't the  Ass  Ella  The  Ass  Ella  Ass  Ass  I know  Instead of  Assella  A little play  A little play on words  Yes  No it wasn't the  Java Log Express  And sack  Alright so what's this first 48 about? 
[02:18:00]  We uh  We started  Oh I love it  We're back  You know  Well this uh  It's a show  Um  It's the first 48 hours  In a homicide investigation  It's not not actors  They're real people  Real detectives  And uh  Real victims  Witnesses  Everything like that  So  They'll start the show out  With a detective getting a call  They'll play maybe the 9-1-1 call  Oh my god  Someone's been shot  They go to location 
[02:18:30]  And you just see the carnage  But they blur out the faces  Of the dead people  But you get to see them like  Laying there  With those askew shoes  Boy when you  When you  Yeah I can say fuck now  I keep forgetting that  That we're sitting here  When you fall  When you fucking drop dead  Like that  When you're shot  You just  You just fall down  Your bones just go  In whatever kind of  Wacky way  And you can only think  If you didn't have  So many bullets in you  You'd go like 
[02:19:00]  Ow my knee really hurts  Being twisted like this  But they got bullets in them  So they don't care  They're just on the ground  I guess the muscles  Really do a lot  Yeah yeah  Like things you can't even imagine  Because as soon as  There's no life in your body  Then the muscles just  Bah  They turn off  They get elastic-y  I guess at first  And your bones can do  Whatever the hell they please  And that's what happens  They just lay in there  They show that  They give a little synopsis  Of what happened  And then the clock  Starts ticking  Forty-eight 
[02:19:30]  Click  Tick-tock  And then they have  Forty-eight hours  To get a lead  Why?  To get some kind of a lead  Because they say that  If homicide detectives  Don't get some kind of a lead  Within forty-eight hours  That the chances of them  Solving the crime  Are very small  And there's a known thing  With detectives  And all that  I guess people  The evidence is fresh  Yeah, it's got to be fresh  Your leads have got to be close  You need to take that evidence  That you get  And process it into witnesses  And suspects  And you know 
[02:20:00]  That's all has to happen  Within forty-eight hours  Or else  The case goes  Cold  So they do the first forty-eight  And it's amazing  But one thing  I did notice  I watched a marathon of this  And all day  Yesterday  I must have watched  Probably close to twenty episodes  Wow  And  You got to get outside  And get some of this nice  Summer air  I was out during the weekend  Yeah  I was out  Yeah, it was Sunday  Sunday  I just want to do nothing 
[02:20:30]  Because I know  We got to come in early today  So I'm watching  And out of all the episodes  I watch  And they offer two cases  Per episode  They kind of intertwine them  Like they get you  All dramatically hooked  On one case  And then they go  And then five hundred miles away  In Memphis, Tennessee  I hate when they start  That other storyline  Oh, here's the other story  No  But then you get hooked  But they're both so cool  And then you're like  Ah, don't go back to the other one  Now I'm in this one  Yeah  Then they go back  And they're like  Oh, good  Yeah  I want to see how this one finishes up 
[02:21:00]  I watched so many episodes  Dude  One  White guy  Was the murderer  In twenty episodes  One white guy  Stabbed a crack dealer  In the chest  In an apartment complex  Every single other case  Was black on black crime  Murder  With an occasional Hispanic thrown in  Just for good measure 
[02:21:30]  But this is what I'm saying  They got to do something  These leaders  Because the black people  Are killing each other  This N-word funeral  Look, I'm watching CNN right now  They're having  The NAACP  Is getting this big hoopla meeting together  To bury the N-word  To have a funeral for the N-word  Meanwhile  You will watch a simple show  Like First 48  This is  These are police cases  They're not saying  Let's get all the black cases  And put it on TV 
[02:22:00]  This isn't  The first black 48  This is  Crime  Murders that are happening  And they are all  Black on black crimes  Just  Blasting each other  And  Very interesting show to watch  Because  The trickery  That works on people  Stuns me  These people  Never watched  NYPD Blue  They never watched  Adam 12 Tricks  Are working on these people  I saw a great one 
[02:22:30]  They had one guy  They brought him in  And he was scared  They could tell  He was scared  So they took a picture of him  His mug shot  And they put it with  Six other pictures  And then they circled it  In red ink  And wrote  I identify this guy  As the getaway driver  That's all they did  And then they walked in  And went  Hey  Somebody's fingering you  As the getaway driver  The guy freaks out  He goes  I did not do that  I did  It wasn't me  And he was freaking out  And I guess they knew  It wasn't him 
[02:23:00]  So he goes  Well who was it  He goes  Oh it was Deedee  Deedee was the driver  Deedee  So they bring in Deedee  And Deedee ain't giving up nothing  And they tell him  Look your buddy  Your buddy just gave you up  Your buddy Mike  Just gave you up  And he goes  No Mike's my boy  Mike's my boy  He ain't doing that  No way  So they bring Mike back  And they tell Mike  Look we're gonna open the door  Deedee's in there  He goes  If you identify him  And recognize him as Deedee  Just nod your head  So they go 
[02:23:30]  Okay  They open the door  Mike looks in at Deedee  Nods his head  And then they shut the door  Now the guy's in with Deedee  Go  Look  He just fingered you  For the whole thing  Oh god  And meanwhile  All he was doing was saying  Yeah that's him  Right right right  So then Deedee's in there  He goes  Alright now let me tell you  What happened  And he just starts  Turning on everybody  But it's hysterical  The tricks that work  On these people  The trickery  Oh the trickery  Is great  And it just works 
[02:24:00]  Time and time again  They get each  They get one guy  To turn on another guy  By letting him think  They know  And they'll never tell him  Exactly what happened  I saw some guy  Pull the dumbest move ever  This big fat guy  Decides he's gonna take  His ex-girlfriend  And run her over  About 15 times  And leave just  Nothing but a blob  In the street  He destroyed this woman  He killed her obviously  Oh yeah  Everyone's dead  It's homicide  You know  So they all get killed  In this  So she's dead 
[02:24:30]  He ran her over  In the car  Backed over her  About five times  So they find him  He's sitting  On a porch  They walk up to him  And start asking him  About this girl  And he goes  Yeah I knew her  I knew her  And they don't say anything  He goes  But you know  I ain't got a vehicle  So I couldn't have done  Nothing to nobody  And then the woman  Starts laughing  He goes  What do we say  About a vehicle  So the guy  The guy didn't even know 
[02:25:00]  She was run over  And he's like  I ain't even got a vehicle  You just gotta keep  Your mouth shut  He fell for that  He fell for the oldest  Gag in the book  That's why they don't  Give him any information  They let him start talking  And see what they know  About the murder  And it's so  Entertaining to watch  Because they're real people  And you don't realize  How often you should  Shut your mouth  And lawyer up  Because the cops  Will get pissed  When any of these guys  Sit down and go  I want to talk to a lawyer  They'll go 
[02:25:30]  You sure  You don't want to say anything  Okay  They pick up the folder  They walk out  They shut the door  And they slam the folder  On their desk  And go  You lawyered up  Like they're all mad  Because some of these guys  Will just  They talk  Talk  Tack and tack and tack  Yap  Yap  Let's say hi  To Mike in Chicago  Mike what's up  Yeah the best part  About that show  Is the onlookers  The crowd reaction  If you watch  Every single episode  There'll be a black kid  On a bike  In a white t-shirt  Yeah  It looks like 
[02:26:00]  The same setting  Yeah it's three  In the morning  Kids are out  It's the same group  Of people  And no one has a name  It's always like  Oh  I don't know  Gambo  Gambo came over  Do you know  Gambo's name  Nah  He's my boy  Like how long  You've known him  Maybe since like  89  Alright what's  Gambo's real name  I don't know  It's Gambo  Okay  I just know him  As Gambo  And there's different  Was there someone  Named Cheeseburger  There was Cheesy  Cheesy 
[02:26:30]  Cheesy was one of them  That's coming  Like crazy  And Boogie  Cheesy and Boogie  Were accused of murder  How funny is that  Cheesy and Boogie  And they had to bring  Some guy in  To turn on Cheesy  What the McBurgler  Was he turning  The Grimace  And Cheesy and Boogie  What an awful combination  That is  A cheesy Boogie  Yeah  Oh it was  It's a great show though  And it shows these  The gallows humor  Of the detectives  Which is kind of cool  You don't usually show  That  They don't usually show that 
[02:27:00]  Because it's deemed  Politically incorrect  But you know  There's just  Slaughtered people  Laying there  And they got their suit on  And they're talking about  Why'd they come out  Just like this  On a hot day  Hey you look like  A million bucks  And they're standing  Over a shot up body  Nice  But the kids  Are the things  That they really get  They get sensitive about  They got to show  They're like  And they do this other thing  That kind of gets to me  On some level  It doesn't matter  How despicable  The person that was killed is 
[02:27:30]  The cops have to make it  Seem like it's bad  That they're dead  There are some people  That absolutely deserve  To be dead in this show  There's two guys  They were drug dealers  And they got ripped off  A couple of guys  Burst into the house  Shot him dead  Took their drugs  And the cop is like  Well now I gotta go  You know  He's a father  He has four children  Now I gotta go to the wife  And tell him what happened 
[02:28:00]  And meanwhile  He's going to like  Four different women  To tell him that  The baby daddy  From four different children  Has been killed  It's not like  This guy is the upstanding citizen  That was murdered  He's a drug dealer  So they do that  A little too much  And when kids get killed  Because there was this one  It was like  Two year old  In a baby seat  And some guy fires into the car  And just kills the kid  They show dead kid?  No  That's one thing  They won't even blurry  Out the face or anything  They don't show it at all  Good  No dead kid  But they show the 
[02:28:30]  Tiny little body bag  That they put him in  Little bitty body bag  And they show the guys  Not even straining  To put it in  The little morgue mobile  But then the cops  Are all like  You know  Because this guy  Is going to turn up  Because people don't  Stand for baby killers  Because this  And when he got back  To the station house  Because the people around  Won't even talk about it  They try to talk to him  He goes  No one knows nothing  But they get back  To the station house  And the phone's ringing  Just ringing  I know who it is  I know this guy 
[02:29:00]  Talked to this one  You can't be seen  Talking to the cops  Yeah that's what it is  You can't be seen  Talking to the friggin cops  But they want you there  And they're screaming  They wonder why  When they tell  These mothers  That their sons  Are dead  Oh it's that scene  It's the scene from  You know  Every one of those movies  Like  Menace to society  Or any of those  Because  For the most part  They're  They're not  Decent people  They're criminals  That are also being killed  But the mothers 
[02:29:30]  Don't want to  You know  It's still their baby  So they just  Fall down  And the cops are like  This is the part of the job  I don't really enjoy  Having to tell people this  That's actually the part  Kenny would have volunteered for  Oh of course  I'd love to  I'll go  I'll volunteer  I'll go  I'll tell him  We don't know if he's dead yet  That's okay  I'll make an apology  If I'm wrong  If I'm wrong  I'm willing to go back  This show is actually  A rip off though  Is it?  It's so irritating  Yes  I pitched a show 
[02:30:00]  Called 53 and a quarter  It was about  The first 48 hours  But you like to sleep in  So it's a little over 5 hours  The next day  It's a little longer  Let's go to Alan  In Edison, New Jersey  Alan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Al  Hey  Yo, I watched the same marathon  As you did, man  And that one white guy  You're talking about  That was a drug  That killed the drug dealer  Yep  He was the only fucking guy  That started bawling and crying  Oh, is he crying? 
[02:30:30]  I can't take it  I can't take it  He goes  How am I going to survive in there?  Talking about prison?  Because he was like  Some red-headed  What was his crime?  Skinny guy  He'd stabbed this crack dealer  He went out to buy some crack  And it's amazing  How they put this stuff together  The detectives are really amazing  At this stuff  They found a cell phone  They get cell phone records  They find the guy  You know  Is living in the same apartment complex  So they bring him down to question him  And instantly  Everyone's a friggin' liar  Everyone on this show is a liar 
[02:31:00]  They sit down in that interrogation room  And just start lying  And then the guy's going  What are you doing?  He goes  You think you're brought down here  Because we don't know anything yet?  He goes  We know already  I'm waiting for you to tell me  And then the person starts going like  Oh my god  They know  They know  And they sent people out to check his apartment  So they found a knife  Under his mattress  Why would you talk  Even if you thought they knew  Exactly  You think you're going to get a break  You think you're going to get a break 
[02:31:30]  That's what they tell you  They go  You have a choice  Right now  You have a choice  You can make things a lot better for yourself  Or you can go to jail right now  You tell me what you want to do  That's what they do to these guys  And a lot of them  Will just start talking  This one guy had a knife under his bed  While they were interrogating him  They were searching his place  They found blood on the knife  So instantly they call the guy  That's interrogating him  And he goes  Look  We know  Because we know about the knife  We know where it was  In your apartment 
[02:32:00]  We found it  He goes  Why are you still lying to me  And then he's like  Look  I went  I went to get some crack  From the guy  He started  You know  He turned on me  And it was self-defense  It was self-defense  He starts crying  Wouldn't you clean the knife off  Or get rid of it  And the guy didn't have a weapon  The other guy  He still had crack  Clinched in his dead hand  Jeez  And a huge stab wound to his chest  They said  They thought he was shot at first  But they turned him over 
[02:32:30]  And went  Wow  That's a lot of blood  Serial killer guys  Like John Douglas  When they go after you  It's a psychological thing  When they have a case mounting against you  Like especially when you've done  Like a whole bunch of stuff  He said they leave  Like they bring you into a room  Where there's photographs of everything blown up  And they make it look like  They have a mountain  Right  Of evidence  That's it  And that's why you feel overwhelmed by it  And like you have to talk  Or in some cases  You have to explain it  And once you start explaining  All that evidence on the wall  Or what they're saying  You're hanging yourself  Or if they have  Like if it's somebody's head 
[02:33:00]  That got bashed in with a rock  In one case  They had the rock  That was used to kill the person there  Yeah  And I think they brought in  A couple guys they weren't sure of  And the person that kind of fixated on the rock  They knew  Uh huh  Because he knew that was the murder weapon  I mean it's like  The more shit you show somebody  They're amazing  What they can do  As far as  Getting information out of people  When they have this limited evidence  They use whatever evidence they can get  But it's not enough to build a case off of  But it's enough to bring a guy in  And start questioning him about it  And letting him just talk about it 
[02:33:30]  And they wind up hanging themselves  Another good one was a  Some  A couple of homeless guys  Decided to beat the crap out of a homeless guy  Caved his skull in  To steal his scooter  His little motor scooter  And they found a bloody footprint  On a cardboard box  And matched up the pattern on the bottom  It's funny because they make fun of CSI  They go  And then the CSI people are brought in  And the real CSI people  Brought in to take prints and everything  And one of the guys is going  Now we just got to go to the 
[02:34:00]  The shoe print  Or the shoe print analyzing computer  And he starts laughing  You know  It's like  We don't have this  They actually go around  Into the neighborhood  Yeah  And we're telling homeless people  Let me look at your shoes  Let me look at your shoes  Let me look  And they found a guy with a match  No kidding  Yeah  He goes  Now we just go to the shoe match computer  Like CSI's guy  It doesn't work  It is a great show though man  They do intertwine between a couple  I didn't watch the marathon  But I've seen the show  I'm going to go home and watch it today 
[02:34:30]  They said about CSI  Because one guy poured bleach on a bunch of stuff  And another guy burnt a car completely  To get rid of the evidence  And one of the detectives said  He goes  People watching that goddamn CSI show  He goes  They know now to get rid of all these little forensic evidence pieces  That are laying around hairs  And little blood spots  And things like that  Now they're kind of learning  But they're still too stupid  CSI is fucking it up for the real detectives out there  They must be pissed  I was waiting for one of the detectives 
[02:35:00]  To just go  Well Frank  This is a case  Where she was  Driven mad  You know  And put his glasses on  And walk out of frame  You know  Murderers are going free  Because of a TV show  Yeah  Yeah  They're kind of teaching them  But you know  The Imish thing  You know  That's just hurting people  All over the place  Yeah  But there's actual shows  That allow  You know  Criminals  To  You know  Get educated  And get away with stuff  Get rid of the evidence 
[02:35:30]  But this was  I mean  I could not believe  The amount  Of just black on black crime  That is going on  It's just ridiculous  The way they are  Shooting each other  To death  Yeah  Brian has something on that  Brian on Long Island  What's up  Hey  How you doing  I watched the marathon  Of First 48 last weekend  What a great show man  But like I said Anthony  It's mostly black on black crime  I think I've seen  Maybe like one or two cases  Where there's a white guy 
[02:36:00]  And it's a lifestyle  For these guys  You know  The black guys  They get pulled down  Into the station house  I saw one  The suspect's names  Were Mookie  And Knockout  And Knockout  Was ratting out Mookie  And Mookie  The cops knew  What he had done  They had him fingered already  And he was like  Well you know  Whatever it is  Whatever it is  That's life  You know  I'm just going to  Leave it up to God's hands  You know  They live this lifestyle  Like it's such a great thing  To kind of boost  Their streak  I guess  You know  Hey wait  Was Knockout 
[02:36:30]  Was Knockout  A pretty girl  Knockout  Wasn't  A pretty girl  Knockout  Mookie  They all have nicknames  It's hysterical  They all got nicknames  You know  I used to see this  All the time  I used to be at  Cobbs in Brooklyn  So you know  Seeing these guys  It's the same thing  They just  They keep living in the street  Even young kids  Going from the age of  10 years old and up  It's just a glorified  Lifestyle for them  They have no respect  It really is  No respect for each other  And you talk to the families 
[02:37:00]  They talk to the families  Of some of these people  And it's nothing but  You know  He was into drugs  For a while  But he really  Was trying to get  His life together now  It's like well  You know  He's found amongst  A bunch of drugs  And bullet casings  Dead on the ground  I don't think  He was doing such a good job  Of maybe cleaning  His life up  The family  You know  And albeit  They're a little sad  But a bit delusional  Yeah  Let's say hi to Richie  In Rhode Island  Richie  Hey  I was watching that too  Did you see the one  With the guy 
[02:37:30]  They brought him in  For questioning  They let him sit there  For a minute  And he starts praying  And then throwing up  In a cup  Oh yeah  Guy like crosses himself  He's praying to God  And then he's like  He starts throwing up  In a cup  That's in front of him  He just couldn't take it  Yeah  And they were like  Alright  A little bit of pressure  On this guy  The cops know too  They walk in  And they know  And they just  Look him in the eye  And go  You're lying  Because you're  You're lying to me  Because what  Am I stupid  And they just  They just know  That's awesome  I can't wait  To see this show  Frank in Brooklyn 
[02:38:00]  What's up  Yo it's Fred Opie  What's up man  Oh hey Fred  Hey Ed  That one  Where the  61 year old  Black guy  Gunned down  The two guys  In the pickup truck  In the pickup  Yeah  Went into his house  And pulled out  That arsenal  The first thing  I thought of  Was what would  Happen if they  Emptied your house  It was like  40 shotguns  They had about  30 shotguns  In the trunk  And then they  Pulled out like  An AR  And an AK  And yeah  This guy  He was  He was a bad dude  And that's

[02:39:00]  They burnt  Some car so badly  With a body in it  That they're looking in  And they're looking  For a while  And then someone goes  Is that a bra strap  And it's like  Oh man  We might have a woman here  Couldn't even tell  Just burnt to a crisp  Why not just feel  Around in it  That's how I usually tell  Wink  Wink  If it feels like  Like two burnt  Ice cream cones  You'll know you have a gal  Looks like somebody  Burnt a hot pocket  Yep  That's a woman  So it's on A&E 
[02:39:30]  It's called  First 48  Yeah  Yeah  I guess  New episodes  Are starting up  What is this  The second season  I'm not even sure  These were from 2006  Yeah  They got to do follow ups  Because at the end  It's like  He's awaiting trial  For murder one  He's  And then they go  He is assumed innocent  Until proven guilty  Yeah  They have to say that  Yeah  Thanks  Thanks for that  Yeah  I wasn't looking at him  Thinking he was guilty  This is a little strange  We got Orlando  Calling from Miami  Hey how you doing guys  What's up Orlando 
[02:40:00]  What's funny about  That show man  Is that my wife and I  Bet to see  What town  Never gets it done  And I hate to say man  But Miami  Sucks ass man  All you see them  Is they're having  Cuban coffee  They're supposed to be  Checking out some guy  And all of a sudden  They show them  In the corner of the street  They're having some  Cafe con nature  Or coladita  And my wife and I  Are like  Yep of course  Like oh it was Miami  Oh that is funny  48 days  They might get it done then 
[02:40:30]  48 days  Call it  You know the guys  Right because  Sometimes 48 hours  Ticks away  And they go  You know  We didn't get them  We don't have a suspect  We don't have leads  We don't have nothing  And yeah  Miami does seem to be  That city  Remember we used to play  Guess the color  Yeah  Can you do that with this game  No  It's all  The show I mean  You know why  See guess the color  When cops was huge  And everybody was  Watching cops  Ant and I  Back in the day  We would sit around 
[02:41:00]  And the call would come in  And we would guess  If it was a white crime  Or a black crime  Yeah  We were right  Probably 90% of the time  Because it's a lot  A lot of shootings  Going on  A lot of shootings  It's a lot of that  Spur of the moment  Crime of passion  Shootings that go on  Drug related  So a majority  Of these people  That they're  Pulling in  Are black guys  A lot of young black men  That are being  Pulled in on this show  I'm waiting  I'm just waiting 
[02:41:30]  For someone to say  You know  Read a review about it  That says  It's you know  Sensationalizing it  And it's a racist show  Or something like that  But I haven't seen that yet  Nah that'll happen  It's  And you know  A lot of the detectives  Are black  And you know  I'm sure they don't  Like seeing it  You know  They're shaking their heads  All the time  Just going  Geez what a waste  But a lot of these guys  It's amazing  Been on the job  Homicide like 20 years  Do you imagine  Just 20 years  Of marching around  Dead bodies  Just butchered bodies 
[02:42:00]  And stuff  Kids  Yeah right  Then you just you know  Go home to your wife  And kids  I figure after five  You think five  Is the point where  It just doesn't even matter  It's like  You might as well  Be painting  Yeah  Or something  It doesn't matter  You're just another day at work  Alright  So it's first 48  It's on A&E  Yeah check it out  Great show man  I haven't seen it in a while  But it really is a fun show  To watch  Definitely  I gotta check it out  Cause the evidence is so fresh  Yeah  Like if Quincy got stuff  It was always bad  Right  It was always 
[02:42:30]  It was always bad  Sam would always have  Like some bad  Oh  Oh  Is that  It is  Of course it is  He left a footprint Sam  Wait I wanna close my eyes  Remember this  To really appreciate  Jimmy's impression  Go Jimmy  Autopsy  Sam there's a load  On my feet  And I think it's yours  Wow  That's amazing  That's amazing  I don't do impressions  And then Alan Alder 
[02:43:00]  Runs in  And his arm goes out  And he goes  Yes  Yes  That's all I do  The beginning of Quincy  You hear that little  Whip it  Where it's all sexy like  They would show  Quincy  Looking over a body  Every few  Like seconds  Of this  Intro to the show  And he's like  Running his finger  Over the side  Or an arm  And then when this part  Comes up  He's doing that  And then they pan back  And he's on his boat  And it's a woman  And she gets up 
[02:43:30]  And like hugs him  Yeah  She's dead  She's dead  He dragged her  Onto the boat  From the morgue  He fucks her corpse  And Sammy  Shrimp fried rice  And they're 69  Sam I told you  Don't come in my hair  Sam  Sam's a cunt  His foil  That's great  Alright Quincy  Yeah  Why don't we take a break 
[02:44:00]  And continue  I think so  Yeah we'll do that  It's Opie and Anthony  And little Jimmy Norton  I think so  Redding is still going strong  So Opie  What did you do  During the break  Check the train schedule  Oh  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Fast Freddy  From Jamaica Station  He writes  Quincy banged mad chicks  On that yacht  Yes  We just saw the  The opening to Quincy 
[02:44:30]  It's the opening  It's fucking as great  And awful as I remember  Right  Can we play the audio  Over the air  It starts off with a big Q  Yeah it's a big Q  It's on YouTube  Yeah I just throw  Quincy M-E in there  Yeah everything  Anything you need to find  Is online man  Yeah yeah  You want to  Where would you go  Years ago  To the library  Never  To see the beginning  Of Quincy  It's like I need to see  The opening credit sequence  To Quincy  Now  You know what 
[02:45:00]  Bam it's there now  This is a little too local  But YouTube is ruining  The radio and TV museum  Is it?  Yeah cause I used to go there a lot  You go to the radio and TV museum  And you're like  You know I want to  I want to see  Old mash episodes  Or whatever  So you go there  And you hang out for the afternoon  And watch an old mash episode  Yes yes  Wow  I thought Alan Alda  Was in here  In the studio  Right yes  Wow  Wow  The friggin arm motion  The voice  I saw him over the break we had 
[02:45:30]  I saw Alan Alda  I had to call Jimmy  I hope he called me  I called Jimmy immediately  Where'd you see him?  Just going into a restaurant  To get the blue plate special  Or something  Man is he old  And his pants were like  A bit high  Were you getting the blue plate special?  Yes  Oh  Okay  Was the service good?  Damn  Yes  Yes  Right  Yes  It has a little Woody Allen  I love it  A little Woody Allen  There as well  I could picture Alan Alda 
[02:46:00]  Doing that  Cause the arm is always  Right  His hand is always exasperated  And his eyes are like  Squinty  Yes  His nose curls up  And he just  He's very passionate  About what he's saying  It's perfect Jimmy  Love Jimmy's impression  I saw very few  But I do them  Oh so wonderful  To a T  Radio TV museum  So maybe you're a fan  Of old commercials  So you go there  And you watch old TV commercials  All afternoon  But now with YouTube  You don't have to leave the house  Sure  That's what I do  It's all right there  I watch old commercials  I like them  I know  That's why I brought that up 
[02:46:30]  And that's why I brought  The Alan Alda up  So he could do his dumb  Alan Alda  Oh so you can hear it  Brilliant Alan Alda  I figure it would kill 30 seconds  Brilliant  Are you kidding me  I sound just like  The real people  Oh I know  I know what he meant  Henry  Hey  Let's hear the Quincy music  Because that's a damn good one  Well describe what you're seeing  Yeah here it is  It's wonderful  Because some of these scenes  Really bother Jimmy  All right right now  It's a stupid bot  That's Eric  Stop coughing over there  It's the instrumentation  There's a big Q 
[02:47:00]  And Jack Klugman's name  Appears in it  And then you have to watch  The whole opening sequence  Through a Q  Wait here it goes  Quincy M.E.  He stands for medical examiner  He's going to show the cops  A dead body  The world of forensic medicine  And he pulls the tarp  Off the body  And all the cops are fainting  They're all fainting  They can't see dead bodies  And now there's a picture  Of him clapping  He's wearing a sweater  With like a collar  Yeah he was out  Having a good time  He's clapping  It's interspersed  The footage  And now it's three Q's 
[02:47:30]  That we're watching  It's him like doing work  As a ghoulish  Medical examiner  And others  Him having a good time  Yeah shaving  Drinking some wine  And here he goes  Pinching a blonde's arm  And she has a big fat  Long flat cardboard ass  And she's on this  Fucking creepy yacht house  Just like the fucking  Unabomber's house  What a fucking long  Flat  Creepy  Bad ass  Yeah but you said  She's hot  And too hot for Mr. Klugman  She's too hot for him  Oh she's too hot for him 
[02:48:00]  Because she's breathing  Too hot for Quincy  She fucking  She sits up  And he's like  All I want to do  Is come in your mouth  Oh wow  And fucking  Lieutenant Monaghan  Who is also Speed  Comes in and goes  Ah yeah I got the same  Shitty accent  I had the other show  Quincy  Where are you asking  I forget who you are  Oh wait there's no  Faggot traipsing around  With you  So I guess this would be  Quincy  Who do you got  The Jap or the faggot  Alright that'd be  That'd be the odd couple  And this would be  Quincy  And fucking stupid Sam 
[02:48:30]  Robert Edo  Played Sam  I didn't realize  He was only in  31 episodes of Quincy  Oh  And how many were there  148  Where have you been  Are you shitting me  No 148  Did he leave early  Or something  I don't know  I think he wanted  To be bumped up  Wow  I think they started  Sam  Jerkoff  Sam J-O  J-O  But it was never  A big hit  Maybe they just  Replaced him  And no one knew  Yeah  Sam  It was like  Six different actors  Wow 
[02:49:00]  That is  That's nostalgic  Listening to that again  Next time you gotta tell us  To close our eyes  So we can really appreciate it  Yeah but it's funny  Where he's pinching  The girl's arm  Yeah  And she sits up  And all Quincy's idea  Of dressing fancy was  Was a shitty sweater vest  With a fucking collar  Shut under it  And one of them  My favorite  He's clapping  Like he's kinda clapping  And laughing  Yeah he was having a good time  I'd love to know  What was happening  Oh he was probably out  Night on the town  Price I bet you  Someone just brought in  A fucking  A fresh dead blonde 
[02:49:30]  And she still had  Like bubbling spittle  And he's like  Yeah  Sam you gotta get  Her panties off  Sam  E-Rock's gonna play it again  So he can see him dance  Watch him dance  I wanna see his little dance move  Well try to  When does it come up  Wait try to mention  All the things he does  In this opener  Again this is where  He's flipping the sheet back  Yeah all the cops  And the rookie cops faint  They all faint away  Yeah they all faint  All right so then  He's clapping  I missed the clap 
[02:50:00]  Oh come on rewind  I missed the clap  Rewind  Show me which cue it's in  The upper left hand cue  He does a quick clap last  Yeah see  Go back a little more  Let me see  Watch his clap last  Watch  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey  So he's watching the team win  Wait go back  Wait that's probably the reaction  He had when he heard  Like eight people were killed  I'll be working for a month  Hey  Hey what about the car  Going over the cliff  What does that have to do  I don't know  Maybe it was Sam's driving 
[02:50:30]  And hence only 31 episodes  That was Robert Edo  On his way to work  Might as well  Might as well put it in the opener  Poor fella  And he's in court  He's testifying  He's running across the street  Go back and look at  Watch it  In the bottom queue  Quincy's running  Like he's solving a crime  What's he doing  Why would he have to like  Run for anything  He's a medical examiner  I know  What does he do  He's not apprehending  Well because he turned into  A little  He's chasing a corpse  If you remember  He turned into  A little bit of a detective 
[02:51:00]  As well  He did kind of  Overstep his boundaries  Watch him run  Watch him run  This is hard  Look at this  Oh my god  Huffing and puffing  Old Jack Klugman run  That's the run he makes  When he's going to get radiation  Sam my throat is falling out  He was trying to run away  From cancer  And cancer caught on  He was running away  From cancer  And he ran right to it  Accidentally  Whoops  I ran the wrong way  Oh I love Quincy  These are the greatest clips  She's doing all of these things 
[02:51:30]  And here's the hot blonde  With her cardboard  Flat awful long cardboard ass  And she gets her  A little drink  Maybe that's why  Quincy hands her a drink  Maybe that's  A roofie in it  A roofie in it  Maybe that's why  He clapped  Because a fucking dead girl  With a bubble ass  That he can fucking  Tape to her ass  He's going to ask her  To just lay in a tub  Full of ice  For a while  Until her lips  Turn blue  I love when  Fucking Quincy  Solves a crime  E to the rock  Find us like a short 
[02:52:00]  Quincy clip  That we can play  He would definitely  Overstep his boundaries  Though as a medical examiner  What do you do  As a medical examiner  You might go down  To the scene of the crime  You look at the dead body  And then when you're  At your office there  Then you gotta do  Like the autopsy  You're looking for evidence  You're not chasing suspects  In a suit  With a bad sweater vest  Yeah  Here's what these guys do  Wait  We're gonna  Oh good  We got a little clip  Michael Bodden  Uh huh  Who does those HBO  What a ghoul he is  That's the guy 
[02:52:30]  And the maggots  Had eaten  Yeah  And we knew  Where she was  That's what they do  By the maggots  We knew  The french fries  Were digested  At a slower rate  And we saw  The bite marks  Were actually  In the french fries  The contents of his stomach  Were emptied  It's like  Oh you ghoul  Yeah  You ghoul  Uh we snacked  On a few of them  Finds a  Just opens up  The stomach  He's holding it  In his left hand  Like a pouch  Just nibbling  Finds a fingernail 
[02:53:00]  And then next thing you know  He tells you exactly  What what's  You know  How old she was  Of course  And what have they died of  Ah it's just creepy  Sam  Here's a Quincy clip  Oh well  Is it possible  There's some doubt  That Ben Miller  Killed Stanley  As far as the police are concerned  What about you doctor  Yes  I have a question of doubt  Do you really  Yes I do  Really  Yes I do  Yeah  Do you really  Talking to me  Of course  What happened  Nothing even makes any sense 
[02:53:30]  Are they screwing at this clip  Nothing even makes any sense  Wait a minute  What  That was a comedy clip  Someone threw together  Wait  That should have been  Cuncy  That was funny  That was funny  I thought we were going to get real Quincy  But instead  No  This is someone made a mockery  Of Quincy  They edited it  Oh  Well is it possible  There's some doubt  That Ben Miller  Killed Stanley  Not as far as the police are concerned  What about you doctor  Yes  I have a question of doubt  Do you really  Yes I do  Really 
[02:54:00]  Yes I do  Do  Yeah  Do you really  Talking to me  Of course I'm talking to you  Why do you say that  Nothing here makes any sense  Can you get a clip of Quincy and Sam together  Sam  An intense moment between Quincy and Sam  Oh a loving moment  Yeah  And he used to  It was a big goof  Because sometimes he'd open up the refrigerator  In this grotesque  You know  Where dead bodies are  And he'd pull his lunch out  Because Quincy don't care  It's just  He's part of the job 
[02:54:30]  Why not  He'd be drinking his five alive  And it was really a fucking  Coagulated blood sample  Sam  And they mixed this up  With the Robert Reed sample  Dan you got some  Oh  Fucking Quincy man  Fucking bunch of beakers  What a  Oh he's talking to a lady  Alright  Let's get a little exchange  She looks like a fat Sally Field  Let's listen to this  Are we getting two 
[02:55:00]  What the hell happened  What'd you do Iraq  No I don't think he's doing  It's  I don't know  What took you off  That it's called  Quincy Punk episode  Every time you find a Quincy something  It starts off normal  And then people mess with it  Is that like something to do  Yes  I never knew Quincy was so popular  With the  That's pretty cool 
[02:55:30]  To like screw with  Or last of the party man  People have been goofing on Quincy  For a long time  Damn  Hey get to that one episode  It was like episode 41  Quincy eats a log of shit  It looks just like  A touchy roll Sam  But then  Sam doesn't look Asian  Sam  Yes  Oh wow  Hey  Oh my god  You just  It's a star studded  That's right  Aaron Orda  They can't fuck us on XM for that 
[02:56:00]  Can they  Probably  Suckers  Who knows  Oh  Oh you got another Quincy  How could you not find Quincy  There's 600 of them  There's just a million  Copies of the intro  We got  We got password  The password  Is  Cunt  Alright  Let's get some good Quincy clips  We want Quincy clips  That's all we want  Oh  Oh what's this  Uh oh  This doesn't look good  That looks like cancer  It's a PSA on the early detection of oral cancer 
[02:56:30]  Okay  It's here  Quincy  Which is best known as that of Oscar and Quincy  But the voice you hear now is the product of cancer  Oh  Each year 30,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral cancer  Sadly within five years only half of them will still be alive  That's one person every hour of every day  Even though my battle to regain my voice was tough  I am one of the lucky ones  You see I came to this cancer through the use of tobacco 
[02:57:00]  But evidence from major cancer centers  Oh  Indicates that young non-smoking people  Are increasingly being diagnosed with this disease  Given its deadly nature  I want you to think in terms of an annual screening  Damn  It's hard to breathe  By a knowledgeable dental or medical professional  It can catch cancer in its earliest highly curable stages  Hey I'm living proof that early detection does save lives 
[02:57:30]  Can I say something  He looks unbelievable  He looks great  Yeah how's that happen  He looks like the same guy  I know  That's like a year ago  But he tells you  I do a Quincy impression now  That's sad Quincy  That's sad Quincy  I do happy Quincy  Oh what is this  With Jonathan Frakes  We were having a lot of fun  And then  How is he on there  I think they edited this  I bet they did  Give us some sound  Put some sound on before you get a  You are about to enter the most

[03:03:30]  Hot dog eating contest  It was probably even before that  Yeah  How old is that stupid contest  How old is the hot dog  Eating contest at Nathan's  Nathaniel  You should know  It's your namesake  Pat joke for a Pat event  Alright we're trying to get Pat on the phone  But  Someone's got to explain this  Because I was watching  Like they're taking this  Seriously  Like it's a real sporting event  Oh the announcers  I think at one point  They said this is the greatest moment 
[03:04:00]  In sports history  Yeah  They get goofy  The announcers  They were kidding  Yeah they were kidding  Are you sure  Positive  It's so tongue in cheek  It's like really  You know  When they say it's the greatest moment  In sports history  They're definitely kidding  Or they should be fired  The announcers believe  Chestnut winning  Would be the greatest moment  In the history of American sports  Yeah  I'm telling you  92 years they've been doing that contest  And since 1915  Holy shit  I just wish the survivors 
[03:04:30]  Of the Titanic  Could be here  Oh wait they can  Something  Two years ago  Or something  Here we go  Three  Two  One  Go  And the Gurgitators  Are underway  On Coney Island  The Gurgitators  And Joey  Focusing on his own game  What I saw early though  Was Kobayashi  Going after it  Is  Is it  Kurt Schilling-esque  Better than Kurt Schilling 
[03:05:00]  Look at him go  Kobayashi comes in behind  With five  It is so on right now  We just didn't know  For about two weeks  What was going to happen  That is funny  Huh  They're just doing  Schilling  Yeah  Like they're comparing  With Kurt Schilling  It's not blood on a sock  It's ketchup  Oh boy  We got Diana  From California  She wants to talk  About something  That has nothing  To do with anything  Oh no  Hi Diana  What's up 
[03:05:30]  Hey  First of all  You guys are allowed  To be doing this  Because it's  Pot Talk Monday  Right  Yeah  Pot Talk Monday  We decided to talk  About Quincy  Very good  Okay  And I remember  The guy on  On Jerry  That cut off his legs  Yes  Do you remember  The tape on  It's really a disorder  I got a magazine  The Psychology Today magazine  And it's called  Body Identity Integrity Disorder  And lots of people  Apparently have it  Yes  We used to call it  Douchebag  Well I know that  But I thought it was weird  Is there a condition

[03:06:30]  To talking about  Hot dogs  Oh right  The hot dog  Eating contest  She got anything  On hot dogs  She did shave  Her pussy  Didn't she  Horse pucky  Oh wow  That was Colonel Potter  He's doing a Colonel Potter  I don't sound like him  But I do his terms  Right  Oh I see some Quincy  I'm sorry  I apologize  That's alright  I'll talk to you guys later 
[03:07:00]  I love you guys  Bye  Thank you  There she goes  Here we go  More announcers  Kobayashi is bringing it right now  Joey Chestnut though  Not concerned  Very wise not to  Not to sleep on Kobayashi  The American  Joey Chestnut  Is still out in front  Now 43  But Kobayashi is closing in  The crowd reacting constantly  To everyone  Of Kobayashi's moves  He's looking strong  He obviously didn't come in here  To bone it in  He's here for the competition  I would love to know 
[03:07:30]  What these guys do  When they're not announcing  The hot dog contest  I think they're ESPN guys  Do they do real sports?  Yeah  Pat Pertoletti  With the mustache  Pat Philbin looks like  He likes to pace himself  But he's not even going to  Break the top five  Right there  Poor Pat Philbin  Our own Pat from Monarche  What is a Philbin?  What is a Philbin?  Isn't it a bean or something?  No  What is it?  It's actually when you have  A storage thing  With shit piled into it  You fill the bin  It's a Philbin 
[03:08:00]  No it's a Philbert  What the  I thought it was  Some kind of food  Don't mind me  Philbert  I'm confused  Because Will from Michigan  Writes  Chestnut broke the record  Last month in Arizona  With 59 and a half  Hot dogs  And smashed the record  At Nathan's  With 66  And then he finishes up  By saying  Who really gives a fuck?  But it seems like  Will gave a fuck  Because he knows all that  Absolutely  Pace himself  But he's not even going to  Break the top five  Right there  Pat Philbin  The great Kobayashi  Still very much in this 
[03:08:30]  Amazing effort  There's Crazy Legs  Conte  It's Conte's fifth appearance  At Nathan's  Like Kenny Loft  And Sam Casale  You think they're out of it  And they pop up again  He's got the staying power  Of Robert Horry  But not the rings  Not the belts  I'm telling you  Chestnut is averaging  Five dogs  Ahead of Kobayashi  As we move through  Competition here  Yeah he is  Setting a good pace  Exciting  Yeah it's just amazing  How much time do they have  To actually  12 minutes  Oh really  I think 
[03:09:00]  Yep  Okay so we are  Nearing the three minute mark  Joey  Just a dog above  And Kobayashi  Now bringing it  In the final quarter  And there we go  Chestnut has  A new record  For Nathan's  He broke the old one  Set by Kobayashi  53 and three quarters  As he goes through  54  Since 1916  A hot dog contest  Has occurred  On this corner  Never before  Has this crowd  Or any crowd  Seen 54 dogs eaten  And that happened  In just nine minutes 
[03:09:30]  Wow that's exciting  Chris from Wilkes-Barre  According to legend  On July 4th  1916  Four immigrants  Had a hot dog  Eating contest  At Nathan's famous  Stand in Coney Island  To settle in an argument  About who was  The most patriotic  After 12 minutes  James Mullen  Had eaten  13 hot dogs  Hey James Mullen  Good one  Don't you know  Big Irish drunk  He was  A logger  Of course he was  Kobayashi pausing now  Kobayashi pausing now 
[03:10:00]  39 seconds remain  This would be the  Greatest moment  In the history  Of American sports  If Chestnut  Can bring the belt home  To Coney Island  Has been gone  For nine years  Chestnut  Scores up to 62  Kobayashi at 61  20 seconds to go  Wait  So Kobayashi  Got past his old record  Oh no  Joey Chestnut  Yeah but Kobayashi  Oh yeah he did too  Yeah yeah  I'm sorry  He was okay  Yes  Wow  Five  Four  Three 
[03:10:30]  Two  One  One  Oh  We got a photo  Finish  That could have been  A DQ  That's a Kobayashi  Reversal within the  Framework of the competition  I'm afraid the judges  Are going to call that  That is up to the judges  We have two judges  And that  Paul  Is the spray zone  Unbelievable valor  From that man  Right there  Joey Chestnut  He may indeed  Have changed the course  Of this nation  Righted the course  Of our nation  Chestnut is a true 
[03:11:00]  American hero  It was actually  That close though  That they didn't know  Who won  Yeah  No then the guy  Realized  Yeah  He starts spitting up  Hot dogs  He's trying to hold  In his mouth  Yeah  It was coming out  Of his nose  Kobayashi  Really  Yeah  Trying to keep it  All in  It got a little  A little gross of you  Ladies and gentlemen  Of Brooklyn and the world  In second place  With 63 hot dogs and buns  Takeiro Kobayashi  Chestnut has done it  However  In first place 
[03:11:30]  In first place  With 66 hot dogs and buns  Joey Chestnut  Wow  I'm tearing up  Just like the first time  I heard it  We should try to get the guy  On the show today  I want to know about  The aftermath  Like how many dumps  How ridiculous 
[03:12:00]  Are the dumps  Just big  Try looking at what  That many hot dogs  And buns look like  In a pile  Minced up even  Completely chopped up  How do you fit that  In you  These guys  Do we have footage  Of these guys at all  Eric  Because I know Kobayashi  Is like really slim  Yeah they're skinny  Is the other guy  Joey Chestnut  Oh yeah  Joey's pretty slim too  That's the whole new thing  Pat was saying  That's the new  You know thing  Is to be skinny  How does Kobayashi  Have a fat belt  Yeah  Pat has a fat belt 
[03:12:30]  Prevents your stomach  From expanding  Fat belt  Yeah I'm serious  A fat head  We should get this guy  On though  I mean  What  He's too busy for us  I mean  Who wants to talk to him  It could be all over the world  Who wants to talk to him  At this point  Kobayashi's like  Legitimately famous  No come on  Get a  Let's get a Super Bowl quarterback  Let's get a  You know  Hey Pat  Hey Ope  There he is  Hey Pat  How are you  Hey Pat  Hey guys  How you doing  The only belt I win 
[03:13:00]  Is the belt of fat  That's fat belt  You ate 24 hot dogs  Pat  Yeah I was a little  Disappointed  I qualified with 27  And I was hoping  To do 30 plus  But my new strategy  Of not eating  Three days  Before the competition  Didn't work out  For me too well  Didn't work out  Didn't work out  Why don't you use  The same strategies  That Kobayashi has used  Yeah you're the only one  Up there actually  Enjoying the hot dog  That salad  That big salad thing 
[03:13:30]  And then a lot of water  To stretch it out  And  They weren't tasty  Did you come in  Last place Pat  No I came in 12th  Out of  About 20  Oh very good  Yeah  Hey Pat  Do you know Kobayashi  Yeah  I saw him at the hotel  I  I  Pointed out a girl  Who had  I heart Kobayashi  Panties on  And he really liked that  I did huh  Hey by the way 
[03:14:00]  Did it remind him  To go out for sushi  By the way  Dave from northeast  Philly  Obi  Didn't you beat  Joey Chestnut's record  On the train  They will not  Leave the train alone  So Pat  What can you tell us  Give us the inside  Scoop on the contest  Man  Joey won  What was Kobayashi's  Final total there  It was 63 
[03:14:30]  I think they deducted  Some  It was closer  But they deducted  Some for the  Stuff that came  Flying out of his mouth  Yeah what do they  Call that stuff  That flies out  Into the cup  And it's all moist  And stuff  There's a word for it  Delish  It's called  The reversal of fortune  Or Elvis leaving the building  I know  But there was  There's a  But there's a  There's a  Hackey name for it  Was there  Yeah I forgot  What they said  I did on  On Pat  Fluvic 
[03:15:00]  Stuff  I'm not sure  Exactly what they call it  I don't know  Are the announcers  Goofing on you guys  Or were they  Really into it  I can't really figure it out  I thought there was a little bit  Of a diss  When they didn't use  My moniker  My Pat from  Yes  Moniker  They said  Pat Philbin  Yeah Pat Philbin  They said something about  Weebles wobbling  But not falling down  Oh did they  Yeah I heard that  Yeah  Pat was looking  Rock and rollish  Man you had your  Sunglasses on  When they announced you  Like a rock star 
[03:15:30]  Yeah  Now what  What happened  The next day  When you have to  Take that dump  Well  This year was a little  Different  Usually  It's not that bad  But I think  Since I was all  Cleared out  From not eating  For three days  The last thing I had  Was like breakfast  On the way back  From Mohegan Sun  And that was  Sunday morning  And this  It all turned  A yellow liquid  Which  I deposited  Nicely at the  W Hotel  On their second floor 
[03:16:00]  Oh my god  I just sprayed  Their bowl  Hey Pat  How many days  Are you supposed  To not eat  Well my qualifier  I didn't eat  The day before  And I did 27  So I go  Oh that's pretty good  So I'll do it  A couple more days  And maybe I'll do more  But it didn't work out  Like that  Everything like  Shut down on me  I don't think  You should fast  For the  You know  Three days  No  I should eat  A really big meal  To get that stomach  Stretched  Yep  Stretched it out  Yeah  But it's still 
[03:16:30]  The first hot dog  I had was like  A lead balloon  I was like  Oh this is going  To be a struggle  Then I was hearing  Them say  Joey and Colby  They're like  On 30  At the two minute mark  And I was like  Holy crap  Who were you on  I was  I think I was on  Four or five  Wow  That's  I tend to pace myself  I always look like  I'm going real slow  But even when I do  27  I just keep pace  I still don't  A lot of people do like  30 in the first two minutes  And then they slow down  But I pretty much keep 
[03:17:00]  The same pace  Throughout the whole contest  I still don't get it man  I don't get how  They're able to eat  66 hot dogs  In 12 minutes  Dude when do you eat again  Like say you do this  Like a guy like Kobayashi  Or Joey  Next day man  Will they eat that night  Or the next day  I think the next day  Because their stomach's  So stressed out  Well Joey and Colby  They're kind of special  They probably sequester themselves  And do whatever  They gotta do  I had some ice cream  A little later  A couple hours later  Oh sweetie  It was like an 
[03:17:30]  After party  I was drinking some beers  I still can't get past  The yellow liquid  I know  Shooting out of his ass  Because we've all seen  His asshole  Oh yeah  Now just picture yellow  Just shooting out  Oh  How many rolls of toilet paper  Did you need to clean up  Oh  Disgusting  Well congratulations  On just another fine showing  I mean  You know  You qualify every year  Not many people  I got 60 pounds  Of hot dogs  From my qualifier 
[03:18:00]  I won  I think I'm gonna bring  Them to the PNC  Tailgate  Ah  Wait they actually  Give you hot dogs  For qualifying  Yeah  A year's supply  I like to think of it  As just three months  60 pounds  Hey how'd it go  With the girl  What girl  The girl that was  Here from out of town  Oh  Oh  Yeah she came for a nice visit  She went to Coney Island  And then she  Went back home  But did you have a nice visit 
[03:18:30]  We worry about you  Yeah it was nice  I was nice  Yeah  Yeah we had fun  Pat  She went on the bus  With me  To Coney Island  You had to take a bus  No  The bus of champions  With everybody  All the competitors on it  The bus of champions  The bus of champions  She had a friends  And family pass  So she was able  To ride on there  With all the superstars  Basically  Basically you're saying  She had daddy's pass  Yeah  Well was there any sparks 
[03:19:00]  Flying  I think we know  You like this girl  4th of July  We were on the rims there  For a while  On the bus  Sparks flying  Nah  Nah  Nah  It was just a friendly visit  Well I mean  Will you get any vibes  I mean you said  That you both wanted  To get your lives together  A little bit  Yeah I got a vibe  That it was just a visit  And you paid for this vibe  Right  No actually  Our friends paid 
[03:19:30]  For a ride back anyway  Did she  Did she stay with you  Yeah  We were at the  W Hotel  In the city  Oh  Now  She was in there  Overnight with you  Yeah  Ooh how was that  Okay  How was that  Yeah we're just sharing it  How  How  It was working  How  How was the  How were the sleeping arrangements  Uh  None 
[03:20:00]  She was sleeping on  On the right side  And I was on the left side  Oh but you were on the same bed  Yeah  Yeah  What's she sleeping  What's she sleeping  We're buddies  Pals  What's she sleeping  Uh  Pretty much close  Panty  Pretty much close  Now that could be  He probably wore a snow  Suit to bed  Skis  Skis  By the way  Redding is very  He's just being hurtful 
[03:20:30]  At this point  Is he  Pat took the bus of champions  And Opie took the train of faggots  Ow  Yeah  Yeah  Wait  So no action for you Pat  Wait a minute  Nice W hotel  Did this  Business as usual  Pat let me ask you a question  Did you ever buy her a plane ticket  And wait at the airport  And she never showed up  Gee who you been talking to Jimmy  I don't  It's actually  No no no  It's coming up on the screen  I'm asking you  Ah the screen  That's a little bit of a screen 
[03:21:00]  Uh  We call it the screen of  Of truth  So  What's that  Yeah  Yeah uh  Possibly  How many times  No no  One once  I had a credit for that flight  Something happened  Uh  Didn't uh  Didn't work out  Did she call you and let you know  She wasn't coming  Uh  No  He bought the ticket  She didn't show  He got a credit  There was a little problem  He used it again  Got uh  Lesser  Credit  Yeah 
[03:21:30]  What was her explanation  What was her explanation  As to why she didn't come  Uh she had uh  Something come up  Something suddenly came up  Like Marsha  And I went still packing home  It can happen  Oh  Yeah  Hold on Pat  It can happen that somebody  Has something come up  That happens  But why didn't she call you  That's my concern  Well uh  Yeah I  Well I had a little issue 
[03:22:00]  With that  Yeah  You know we moved on from that  Ah  Yeah  She just left you in the airport  Well one could look at it that way  Yes  One could  The facts might tear that out  Well is there another way  We could look at this  Yeah  Yeah  All right  All right  But  So how long did it take you  To forgive her  Uh  Until the next 
[03:22:30]  Flight out  Well wait  When did she  When did she finally come  How much later  She didn't do any coming  No  What's that  How much like  Not with me anyway  The plane  The plane got there right  And all of a sudden  You're there waiting  By baggage claim or something  All excited  Probably have flowers in your hand  Oh  She had a prepaid phone  And it expired  And we weren't able to  Get a hold of each other 
[03:23:00]  And evidently she didn't have  Access to a landline or something  And I just assumed  At an airport  I kind of had a bad feeling  Because she didn't talk to me that day  So that night  It was like a 10 o'clock  Uh  Arrival thing  So I showed up at the airport  And uh  I watched everybody get off the plane  And she wasn't one of those people  Oh  Standing there watching everybody  Getting off  And you're just like  Were you craning your neck  Trying to see  I think that might be  Oh no  Guess when that was her 
[03:23:30]  Oh she's not  Oh no  And then like  The flight crew gets off  And the cleaning people go on  Separated families coming together  Hugging each other  And me just standing there  Them wondering  Who the hell I am  Oh  And then  When did she finally come Pat  How much longer after that episode happened  Uh  That  Well that was  That was like a  Actually like a month and a half ago  And she came  Like just before the contest  And left  Like Thursday  Okay so a month and a half ago 
[03:24:00]  How much time went by  From the time that you're standing there  In the airport  And you two finally spoke  Uh  It was like  A couple days  A couple of days  You didn't  Yeah  How long were you waiting  At the airport  A couple of days  A couple of days  How long were you standing there  Waiting for her to come out  Uh  When I saw the flight number  Go off the  The electronic board  Oh my god  Oh no Pat  Did you wait for the next flight  Thinking maybe she missed her flight  And she's on the next one  I think it was a place to leave 
[03:24:30]  At that point  Hey Pat  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Pat who cares about you  We got a real champion  On the phone here  Joey Chestnut  What's up Joey  Joey  Joey  Meow  Joey Chestnut

[03:26:30]  Pat's dump  In a second here  Now what  Now what are we  Waiting for  Alright we might have  Uh  Uh  Pat continue  Hello  Was this a tennis match  Yeah continue  So  Tell us more about  That dump  Oh  Wow  Hold on  Joey's ready  Alright we'll get back  To you in a second  Uh  Joey Chestnut  How are you Joey  I'm pretty good  There he is  Now we can hear you  We had a bad  Connection there Joey  Joey won the  Hot dog eating contest  Down there in Coney Island  66 hot dogs 
[03:27:00]  Yeah  Congratulations man  Thank you  We have a good friend  Uh  Pat Philbin  He's also Pat from  Munaki  Do you know him  Yeah he's a really nice guy  He's actually the  Most friendly guy you'll ever meet  Oh look at that  Yeah he's easy  He's a good pal of ours  And of course he was in the competition  But uh  Uh  Obviously not of the caliber  Of you sir  Oh you know  Two years ago  I uh  I set my goal to beat Kobayashi  And uh  I was finally the first person to beat him  What exactly  Like 
[03:27:30]  Like what makes you think  Like when you're  Like okay I can eat this many hot dogs  Like what  How do you know you can do that  It was uh  I think like six years ago  When he first won the contest  Uh  I remember thinking  Dang  I could sit 50 hot dogs inside of me  But I didn't do anything for a couple years  And I was just going to school  Yeah  But uh  My little brother signed me up to an eating contest  And then I just  I knew my body was made for it  And I started pushing my body  And uh  And I love to eat  So it's pretty natural for me  Do you eat that night  Or like  When do you finally eat again 
[03:28:00]  After eating 66 hot dogs  Oh I didn't eat uh  That night  Or the next day  Pretty much at all  True  I had protein supplements  The next day  I  I  I really  Keep track of what's going on in my body  And the amount of exercising  I'm doing afterwards  So  I try to  I try to  It's pretty hard  So you guys  You guys now that are  Involved in these  What are you keeping in shape  It's not just the big fat guys doing it  No  We really have to keep in shape  We're gonna  I don't know  Because we're ingesting tons of calories  And uh  And even though we're eating pretty unhealthy 
[03:28:30]  We have to  We have to make sure our bodies can digest it  And stay  Stay fairly healthy  Now uh  Kobayashi of course  Uh  The big champion  The name  Uh  In  In the uh  Field of competitive eating  Uh  What did it feel like  When you looked over  And kind of knew you had it  Oh yeah  It was awesome  Because uh  He'd uh  He'd been dominating the sport  And uh  Humiliating the other American teachers for years  Yeah  It was pretty good to see him uh  Push his body to the limit  And uh  Just  He was actually barfing on stage 
[03:29:00]  Is it uncomfortable  Is it an uncomfortable feeling like  I mean it's like  A marathoner  They're running 26 miles  That's not comfortable  Uh  I'm doing it for a competition  And just to  Just to beat people  I mean  It's not  It's not comfortable  But it's uh  It's worth it  You know  There's a little controversy there  When uh  Kobayashi said he might  Pull out of the competition  Uh  Because uh  He had some kind of injury  Or whatever it was  And everyone was speculating  Well  It's because now  There's somebody 
[03:29:30]  That's going to beat him  And he doesn't want to be beat  Yeah  They were saying  I think everybody  Now calls it Joey-itis  He was just  Oh  Oh look at that  Yeah  I see a t-shirt  Huh  Hey wait  Joey  Was he  Was he graceful  At least in defeat  He was  He was nice  Uh  He uh  He uh  I mean  He uh  He accepted his loss  And uh  He said he's going to come back next year  But uh  Hopefully uh  I'll just be able to push a little bit harder  We can go over  So I can hit 70  How big is the first dump you take 
[03:30:00]  After eating like that  It's man  It's a massive one  Yeah but how  Four pounder  Yeah  Like how massive  It would make anybody proud  Yeah  You got  You're looking into the bowl going  You're really impressed with yourself right  You gotta rate that one  Yeah  Do you get one long log  Or is it like  Kind of stewish  Uh  It's definitely stewish  It's uh  Yeah  But I'm healthy  So it gets through me  And I  And you know  Stop pushing your body 
[03:30:30]  And we're having fun  How many  Now Joey  How many dumps do you take the next day  Before you realize  Okay I'm done with the hot dogs  This is it  It's only  It's a  Not too many  But it's  Going into the contest  I haven't eaten very much  For a couple days  So my body  Absorbs quite a bit  And uh  And I'm not eating that much  After the contest  So a lot of it stays in me  A lot of it uh  Yeah  My body needs a lot of nutrients  Because  I'm  I'm sorry about that  Does the  Does the dump smell like hot dogs 
[03:31:00]  Does the whole house smell like hot dogs  That's a good question  Never  Never  The only thing that smells like hot dogs  Is when I start sweating  You can like  I think  Oh  Sweating hot dogs  And I bet you're sweating  When you're dumping  What color is the dump  Hmm  It's a  Yeah I thought  It's a brown  Light brown  Yeah  Because Pat said  There was some yellow problem  He was having  But then again  He has diabetes  It's probably just  Part of his body  Rotting off him  Yeah 
[03:31:30]  As long as there's no red  Or anything  Uh  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I'm not going to look at it too close  Is it one of those  That really opens  Your asshole wide  Or is it one of them  Because sometimes  You could crap a lot  But your asshole doesn't hurt  But does  Does this one hurt  Like does it open wide  And leave like a big brick  Or is it thin  Nicely tapered  It was  It was  It was conformed to the shape  Very easily  Is  Oh  Would you say you have to flush  More than once during the dump  Or do you  Is it like a double triple  Or quadruple flusher 
[03:32:00]  Or do you  Do you like  Shit once  Flush  Wipe  And then shit again later  I was still in the hotel  So they had like  An industrial toilet  So it was  As big as it was  It was still only  A single toilet  Yeah  When you were dumping  Did you just  Think about doing like  An upper decker  Or anything like that  Leave something for the hotel  It would be like  A collector's item  Yeah  I do want to know though  When you look in  Can you distinguish  The pieces of hot dog  From the pieces of bread 
[03:32:30]  Or is it just all  Mixed up as one dump  It was a little bit  Disappointing  I was hoping I could  But it just looked like  I was a big  Big flop  I was eating too much  Or something  Yeah  My body died  Pretty naturally though  Were you ever tempted though  Like when you really  Have to go  And you don't feel like  Flush just to hang your ass  In the tub  And let it fly  And like see it all  As one unit  I think everybody's  Tempted to do that  Nah  Yeah I bet  Now  After you take a dump  Like that  Clean up  Is it really messy  Are you going through 
[03:33:00]  A lot of toilet paper  Oh that's a good one  Yeah  Does it burn a little bit  Soft, hard  What is it  Part B of that question  Also do you  Do you use like  The little naps  To wipe  Yeah like a wet nap  Or  Yeah they used to be  Called baby wipes  For me  Yeah  But I mean  Is clean up a mess though  Is it a messy one  Nah it's not that bad  I mean it can only get  So messy  As long as I do it  With my cheeks spread  Right right  Yeah cause you don't want  That getting all over you  Wow  It's not like  I'm a big fat ass 
[03:33:30]  I try to stay pretty healthy  No you're a skinny guy  Does the dump  Cause like hemorrhoids  Or anything like that  I mean you're  Releasing a lot of food  Nah  A lot of weight  Coming out  Healthy guy  No you get hemorrhoids  From other things  Yeah yeah  Do you read  When you're taking  That hot dog dump  Do you read something  No focus  Making sure  Making sure  I don't push out  A kidney  You ever think  That now that  You're the champ  That you could sell 
[03:34:00]  Pieces of that dump  Like just slice them off  Like pepperoni slices  And maybe  Like hermetically  Seal them in something  And then sell it  As the Nathan's  Hot dog champion  Dump piece  Like a commemorative coin  Made out of sliced dump  I don't even know  How to respond  Yeah I would say  Respond with  Cha-ching my friend  Because that sounds  Like a good  Money making opportunity  For eBay 
[03:34:30]  Or something like that  Hey Joey  I'll be down with it  Yeah  Joey do you have  A girlfriend  Yeah I got a girlfriend  She uh  Are you so proud  Of your dump  That you have to  Call your girlfriend  And go  Honey you gotta  Check this out  I know it's a little  Gross but come on  I'm the champion  You gotta see  What I left in the bowl  I leave the door open  So she can like  Smell it from the  Rest of the room  Ah that's nice  Did you ever put  A pail on a scale  And dump into that  Oh  To see how much  You're actually  That is actually clever 
[03:35:00]  I've always wondered  How much I actually lose  Well these are the  Questions people  Need to know  Cause then you would  You would absolutely  Be able to figure out  How much you're absorbing  Well you wouldn't  Even have to  You wouldn't even  Have to shit  With the pail  On the scale  What you do  Is you put the pail  On the scale empty  You weigh it  Whatever a child's  Pail would weigh  Right  And then you fill it  With liquid shit  You dump it out  Down the bowl  Yeah 
[03:35:30]  And then you  This way you can  Weigh your shits all day  And you could say  By the end of say  A two day period  You can get  A complete weight  Of how many dumps  You've taken  That would be good  Yeah  And then you can  See the weight  I don't know  What it's good for  I'll tell you  What it's good for  If it comes to  More like eight pounds  The next time  Somebody annoys you  With baby photos  You say  I've shit more than that  I'm not impressed  Do you  What about the gas content 
[03:36:00]  Of the dump  Sometimes you know  You're taking a dump  And then in between  You get that  Any of that  Or is it just  A continuous  Like a  I don't know  A tube  Like a monorail  Of shit  A monorail  Yeah  No it's a  Yeah it's pretty much  The gas  The gas comes  Beforehand  And how long  Does this dump  Take you  Do you get up 
[03:36:30]  And you got like  A butthickey  Or something like that  No no  When I get on that  I'm taking care of business  I don't waste  Any time  You get right to it  Like the way  The hot dogs went in  Come out the same way  Fast  That's a good question too  When the hot dogs  Come out  Are they  Are they really  Like distinguishable  Because you're not chewing  You're basically  You're swallowing  Almost whole hot dogs  Yeah  I kind of asked before you  It digested pretty decently  Oh okay  You did ask that  But do you 
[03:37:00]  Take a close look  No  And go wow  Those are the hot dogs  That won me the championship  Yeah I would have got like  Now they're just shit  In a toilet  I would have got like  A pokey stick  And started poking around  Seeing what you could find in there  See if any of the skins  From the hot dog  Are floating around  Hmm  Do your legs go numb  From you know  Staying on the bowl  That long  No  Usually I'm not  On the bowl  For that long  Wow  I think you would be on there  For a while  But you know  Everybody's digestion 
[03:37:30]  Is different I guess  Hmm  Does it feel like  You have a python  In your ass  That's uh  Trying to make  Its way out  I don't know  What that feels like  Well was it more like  A lot of times  I'll eat certain food  Would you  Does it ever burn  Coming out like  A spicy food dump  Will bother me  As it exits  Does this bother you  At all  At all the time  I ate jalapenos  In a contest  Oh wow  I'll never do that again  Oh yeah  Is that the worst dump  You've ever had  Yeah  That was the most painful  Contest all around 
[03:38:00]  Yeah  Yeah that could blow  Out your asshole  Yeah  Yeah  I'll never do that  Here's what I need to know  Uh  Consistency  Okay here we go  Milk duds  Uh  Chocolate mousse  Or  Water  What uh  Consistency  You know  It's like  What was the middle one again  The second one  Yeah like chocolate mousse  We could go between  Chocolate mousse  And water 
[03:38:30]  Put something in there  Like a  Or between chocolate mousse  And milk duds  It held its shape  Pretty decent  It held its shape  So like chocolate covered banana  Oh yeah  Yeah  So we got  We got milk duds  Which are just annoying  When you get milk duds  Bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop  Milk duds  Pudding with a fetus in it  Yes  With a fetus  Uh  Moose  A nice moose  Yeah  Consistency  Uh  Is good sometimes  As long as there's not too much acid  Do you get a burn 
[03:39:00]  Is there a burning  Sensation  On your asshole  Or does it come out  Without that burn  Because sometimes  You can have a nice shit  It's not too big  Uh  It doesn't rip your ass  Like that  But  There's enough acid  In the leftover food  That it's burning your ass  A little bit  Sometimes  Even I've had to dip  The toilet paper  In a little bit of water  From the sink  And shove it in there  You know  Just to quell that flame  It's just soft enough  Where it doesn't hurt  Yeah  Okay 
[03:39:30]  Have you ever had such a solid dump  That you went into panic mode  Because you thought you might have to  Break out the old scissors  Mmm  The scissors  And cut it loose  You know  Get a plunger  You know  Obviously  So many questions  To ask  And I  Never heard people  Ask the questions  That people want  Answers from  Do you have to  The post game  Do you have to grunt  At the end of the dump  To get the last remaining 
[03:40:00]  Hot dogs out of you  From the front of a woman  I was like  Hooah  Like wow  Hoof  Hoof  Do you hold on to the bowl  With both hands  And just kinda  Yeah  Do you make any of these sounds  Hoof  Hoof  Hoof  Hoof  Anything like that  No  It's more like  It's just like  Kinda like  I'm on a phase  I just take care of it  Are there mustard on the hot dogs  What's that 
[03:40:30]  Are there mustard on those hot dogs  When you eat them  No  I almost put some  Heinz ketchup on there  But uh  The Heinz ketchup  So do you notice any of that  No  No  I'm very lucky  No blood coming out  That'd  Yeah  That'd  Scare me a little bit there  Hey  Just before you  Flushed the big huge dump  What's going through your mind  Like damn  That's all  That's all  I expected more  66 hot dogs  I thought  I'd let go  Of a five pounder 
[03:41:00]  But uh  Were you surprised  It's not that  It's not that  It's not that impressive  Were you surprised  By how much of your body  I'm sorry  How much of the hot dogs  And buns your body  Absorbed  Yeah  As opposed to  When you shit it out  Okay  It would be great  If they all just came out  Like they were in  A big bundle  That wide  That would  You'd see pictures of that  That would hurt  I would not  I would not  Flush that  Yeah  After you dump that much  Do you have like  Gas  The rest of the day

[03:50:00]  Slash Nazi joke  Francine's here  She got fired  From what  Francine got fired  Her job  She was a hooker  For what  Yeah she was a hooker  What'd she do  She wouldn't fuck  Her ass  Because it's getting  Saggy or something  Alright  Uh  You want her in here  Real fast  Uh  Runner up lines of the day  We could  We could do a little of that  Here's a runner up  Line of the day  Hey what about the car  Going over the cliff  What does that have to do  With friends  I don't know  Maybe it was Sam's driving 
[03:50:30]  And hence  Only 31 episodes  So is Robert Edo  On his way to work  Very good  Uh  Another runner up  Line of the day  But  Alas  We are burying  The N word  Steve from Bayshore  The N word  Is somehow  Gonna prove  There's life  After death  He's a funny bastard  Man  Ah 
[03:51:00]  Damn you Steve  Ah  That was a great line  From Steve from Bayshore  Yes it was  Francine what happened  Francine  Yeah we're getting  This news now  That you've been  Fired  Yes guys  I got fired  On Thursday  Last week  That's terrific  That's terrific  So upset  Now what  What were you doing  What was your job  I am a property manager  I manage properties  I'm a property manager  I manage properties 
[03:51:30]  What does that mean  If you had a leaky toilet  If you had a leaky toilet  Or a leaky ceiling  You would call me  And I would get it fixed  Like from  You're not good enough  To unclog toilets  Is that what you're getting at  No I get somebody  To do it  I don't know how to do that  What is that like  Like what organization  Is it an organization  A private company  Or is it based  Like in  Incorporated  But it's  Like here's the deal  Here's what I'm confused with 
[03:52:00]  If you're in an apartment building  And your ceiling's leaking  You could call 311  And then  Like the city  Will be aware  Of this situation  And  And do something  Perhaps  Or just laugh at you  But if you have  A management company  That manages your building  Like where  I usually work for  Oh  Okay  You called me  Now that makes sense  So then  And then you  Get on the phone  With what  A contractor  And say 
[03:52:30]  Send over a plumber  Yes  Because the toilet's broken  Yes  And you apparently  Asked for a plumber  When there was  A ceiling problem  I could usually  Tell those differences  Okay  By the way  I want to know  How she got fired though  Well don't kill the messenger  Douche nozzle  Douche nozzle  Yes  The douche nozzle  Of course  Francine was replaced  With a hotter chick  That puts out  Cock teases  Don't work long  Oh  Well that's not very nice  Is it  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to laugh  I went to work 
[03:53:00]  Looking hot  Every day  There you go  Okay  Every day  And I have no kids  Yeah see  So you don't have  Lasagna belly  Or any of that stuff  I have no lasagna belly  What do you think  Of lasagna belly  I think it's disgusting  You almost  You actually have one kid  I do  You have one kid  The one that fell out  Remember  Oh that  Your miscarriage  He's so dead  Oh my god  He's in a sewer somewhere  Oh my god  What is wrong with her 
[03:53:30]  Remember her story  She had a miscarriage  She didn't know  Like you knew  You were pregnant  But you didn't know  What to do about it  And then one day  It just fell out of her  I was getting my braces tightened  I was getting my braces tightened  And something else got loosened up  Yeah  It just fell out of her  And instead of being sad  She was like  Yay  She was so happy  Seriously  You know how tight  You have to tighten braces  To make a fetus  Fly out of a vagina 
[03:54:00]  Jesus  Is this doing it  Or just some guy  In a garage  With a wrench  Yeah  Did you just go  Ta-da  The heuristic  Prats  Well  I think  It was before  Or after the tightening  I cannot remember  But after  It came out  And I flushed it  And smiled  The lady was knocking  On the door  And she said  Are you and Kay in there  You've been there  For a very long time  And I just 
[03:54:30]  I was just in there  Wiping myself  And just got on  With the rest of my day  Afterwards  So I might have  Gotten my braces tightened  Before or after  The miscarriage  Can I interrupt  Someone is suggesting  Jeremy from Ohio  That maybe she got fired  Because all her abortions  Were clogging up  The plumbing  In this particular building  Did you  Did you look  In the toilet  After  Yes  And did you see  Anything that  Resembled life  Anthony 
[03:55:00]  I did not care  About it  I saw a lot of red  A lot of red  But did you see  Anything that might  Have had a hand  I wanted to look  But you know  I was kind of like  Yeah  If you look  You gotta name it  I was kind of freaked  Out by the whole incident  And I thought  I was on my period  And if my girlfriend  Hadn't called me  And told me  It was a miscarriage  I would have left  The tampon  Shoved up in there  And it would have  Probably been a mess  On the bus  But you probably  Would have died  Of some kind  Of toxic shock syndrome  Do you  You knew you were pregnant 
[03:55:30]  Yeah  And you just thought  You were having  Your period  While you're pregnant  Well it happens  I heard  No  I heard chicks  Get their period  No you get like  You could get like  Spotting and stuff  But if you get  A full fledged period  There's a problem  You gotta go to the hospital  Because you're having  A miscarriage  And if you plugged it up  With a tampon  All that would stay in you  And you would  Get very sick  Really  Yeah really  Matt from Queensbury  I don't like  Francine's a woman  And she's black  And she still got fired 
[03:56:00]  Wow she must have  Really fucked up  Oh  Yeah so what did they tell you  What happened  They just said  It's not working out  And you need to go  You need to go  Yeah  What do you think  Did you say anything  Like excuse me  I'd like a reason  Or  Well  I'd like to say that  I'd like to plead  The seventh  And not say anything  Why the seventh  The seventh  Because then you  Don't incriminate yourself  That's the fifth 
[03:56:30]  Whatever  I think  Isn't the seventh  Like giving women  The vote  Or something  Absolutely  I'd take issue  With that one too  How could you plead  The seventh  Because you  Self-incriminate  Right  Yourself  By saying stuff  That's the fifth  So there's a lawsuit  Sexual harassment  Nice  What did he do  No no no  What's doing her  He went for the  He went for the poop shoot  Didn't he  No no no  What happened  No no no 
[03:57:00]  But at my old job  One of my old bosses  Did try to drug me  Seriously  Drug you  Really  I've had probably  What did he wave  A pinwheel in front of your eyes  No we went to a bar  She does a cheap roofie  For her  No we went  Something colorful  You went to a bar  With your boss  Right there  That doesn't look good  Yeah well  What happened was  It was a very late night  It was like six o'clock  And I was really tired  And he offered me  A ride home  And I was like  Okay I don't care  He always takes me home  Like when he goes to the city  He's just being friendly 
[03:57:30]  So he said  Do you want to go to a bar  And I was like  Yeah sure  So we went to a bar  And when we got out  The bar  I kind of felt  Losey and stuff  And then  We got in the car  And he was driving  And we're on a bridge  And we're about to  Cross the bridge  And I felt really lightheaded  And fainty  So I ran out of the car  At the bridge  And a police guy  Picked me up  And they called the ambulance  And then we went  To the hospital  And they didn't do  I didn't do any tests  On me  But I could  I swear that guy  Put something like  Cocaine or crack 
[03:58:00]  Or something in my drink  That would make you sleepy  Thank you  Yeah it would kind of  By the way  You're pleading the seventh  Right  Which is  In suits  In suits  A common law  Where the value  And controversy  Shall exceed twenty dollars  The right of trial  By jury  Shall be preserved  And no fact  Tried by a jury  Shall be otherwise  Re-examined  In any court  Of the United States  Then according to  The rules  Of the common law  Is that double jeopardy  You're pleading the right  To trial by jury  Is what you pled  Okay I guess so 
[03:58:30]  Is that the same thing  As the fifth  Yes  Yeah it's exactly the same  As a matter of fact  It's a redundant  Yeah  Do you call Howard now  What  Do you call Howard show  Are you serious  I swear to god  Someone's saying  He's on steroids  Okay here's the thing  Okay when you guys  Were off the air  Oh boy  No no no no  I tried to listen to Stern  He is terribly  Boring  There's a lot  Of dead air  And Robin  Sucks  Right  So I 
[03:59:00]  Didn't listen to them  Then I tried to listen  To Hot 97  Cause you know  I'm black  And I couldn't get into it  They sucked as well  And I think that was the  Remember the guy  That came in here  You know  Star  Yeah I tried to listen  To Star  He's really really funny  I don't think he's  On the radio right now  He's really funny  But I didn't really  I don't really get  His show either  Why is somebody saying  That she was on the show  No absolutely not  It's probably just some girl  With the same type of voice  No way  She's been very loyal  To this show  Yeah  I would never  And I tried to listen 
[03:59:30]  It's not ass  It's all good  Curtis and Kubi  I tried them  I tried  I tried everybody  And what I did was  I went into severe depression  Oh no  And I cried  And then  One day you guys were back  And I started listening again  That's wonderful  Some people are saying  Your fetus committed suicide  Good for it  Good for it  Yeah didn't your boss  Used to give you money  For no reason  Is this the same boss  No no no  I worked for  Four or five people 
[04:00:00]  I cannot remember  And one of them  Was like the guy  Who owned the whole thing  And like one of them  Worked under him  And I was like  Office manager  Secretary chick  So I did everything  For them  I wrote their letters  And did their  Little real estate  Research stuff  And stuff  So how did you get fired  You can't give  You can't tell us anything  I can say that  There's a particular  Individual  That might have  Had it in for me  Why  A chick  A girl 
[04:00:30]  Is this a  A chick  That's not as hot  As you  Right  Boss's wife  But I don't  I don't  Well not really  Uh oh  I don't know  But I  I think they just  They just had it in  And that was just it  They just wanted to  Get rid of me  I didn't do anything  Seriously  Like all I did was work  That might have been  The problem  Oh you did the work  Okay I thought  When you didn't do anything  You just kind of came in  And didn't do anything  I came in at 9 o'clock  Or 8.30  Or whatever  And I left at 5 o'clock 
[04:01:00]  And what  So why was the firing  I don't know  I'm just really sad about it  Oh no  Do you  Do you have like  A resume and stuff  I do  You can do another job  Yeah  Are they going to  Give you a reference  Uh they told me  They would  I was like  Yeah I'll use you  Huh  They fired me  They're not going to  Give me a good  Reference  Reference  No  Can you bring  Your resume in  So we can go over it  We would like to  Go over your resume  Yeah  Really 
[04:01:30]  Yeah we'll get you a job  Really  What do you want  To do next  We'll put your resume  Out there  Over the air  And then if you get  A good job offer  We'll field it for you  Yeah  What do you want to do  Like here's a good  Opportunity for you  Think about this  I'll do the same thing  But did you enjoy  Unclogging toilets  With a phone call  I didn't do it  I didn't do it myself  Calling Roto-Rooter  Oh they say  Did you enjoy that  I did call Roto-Rooter  That's the name  And away goes  Troubles down the drain  That's their slogan  But did you enjoy it  Or  Because now's your opportunity 
[04:02:00]  Now  You've got to look at this  As opportunity  For you to now  Move on to do  Something you want to do  And that you enjoy  Well  I did get a degree  In communications  So I really wanted  A broadcasting job  But nobody ever hired me  Or called me back  On  They're tough jobs  To guess  What college  I went to NYU  Oh boy  To make a film  Tuition just went  Way down  And I graduated

[04:08:30]  She's got a cup on the top of his head  Is he fucking opening her own skirt  Red Lobster  I'm not really a fan of Red Lobster  But if you want to take me to Red Lobster  I will go  More expensive or less expensive than Red Lobster  She likes more  I bet she likes the high end places  No no no  I like ethnic foods  I like  I like Iranian  You know  And I like Ethiopian  And I like Indian  And I like West Indian  How's Ethiopian food 
[04:09:00]  I never understood the Ethiopian restaurant  A beetle  It's hot  Is it  It's good stuff  It's really spicy though  I like spicy food  You know what I like  Thai food  Of course it's spicy  And Japanese  The only way you make the dirt taste good  Do you like  Spice it up a little  You like  Indian food  Yes  Like that spicy type food  Yeah that's good stuff  Yeah and I like Japanese too  Japanese  And Japanese  There you go  You're in  After those three  See so it doesn't matter  As long as the food is good  But if you're a good company  And you 
[04:09:30]  You withstand  My horrendous  Conversations  And  Aww  You know how easy it would be  To fake  A good conversation with you  I think  Francine  Just to get laid  A better conversationalist  Than you think  We've spent time together  At their comedy cellar  Where we should come by  And hang out  Yeah she's a very  Cable of holding  A fine conversation  See so all it takes  Is three  But most guys  Don't make it to three  Someone's suggesting  What about  Taking you out  For two dinners  And then you could  Just eat Italian  No 
[04:10:00]  That's  I like the three dinner rule  Fair enough  Or three dates  Or whatever  But  Money  Is important  For what  A relationship  Well  I  I think  I make  Enough money  No you don't  You're unemployed  Right now  Well right now  I'm not making anything  But  I think if you're a guy  And you're about my age  I'm 27  If you're pushing 30 
[04:10:30]  You should make at least  $50,000 a year  For a guy  For a guy  So you should be able  To take me out  And like  Pay for everything  Right  What about  Now this  Doing you in the shitter  Thing  Is that  From the first date  You make an X  On the calendar  And then three months  To the day  Are we talking  Are you that strict  About it  Or you're willing  To maybe two and a half  Months  All right  If you flatter me enough 
[04:11:00]  It could go by  A lot faster  Ah okay  I like flattery  And I'm not talking  Flowers and all the  Bullshit stuff  I mean I would like  Flowers  But most guys  Are too stupid  To realize how much  We like it  But  Flattery in a way  Of like  Just telling you  You look nice  Or things like that  And call me a lot  Call you a lot  Yeah call me like  Every day  At least twice a day  But they just  Buried that  Wow  Buried what  Let's just not  Even go any further  We uh
