<pre> And good, good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Good afternoon.  Wow, what a lovely little surprise in the Daily News today.  Wow, who is that?  The Backstreet Boys there, Opie.  Wow, look at you.  Is this Tiger Beat?  Well, we got a little article written about us in the Daily News today, page 45, if you  want to read it for yourself, so we won't bore you too much with it.  But yeah, nice picture of me, huh?  Wow.  That's the pose you give at the glory hole? 
[00:30]
 Yeah, yeah, that's exactly how it looks.  You got me.  Ouch, that hurts.  Oops.  Yeah, you got me.  Oh, you kidding?  Turn the page and look, you have a glass eye.  Glass eye?  What are you talking about?  Anthony has a glass eye.  I just want everyone in New York to know that.  On page 46, you can see it for yourself.  I'm squinting in one eye.  No, you know.  I got my eyebrow raised up there, Opie.  You're like Sandy Duncan.  You got a glass eye. 
[01:00]
 That eye looks just like Sandy's, man.  Wow.  All right?  Who knew?  But you know, I got to, this pains me to say this, but I will.  I got to thank David Hinckley from the Daily News for writing a very fair article on the  Opie and Anthony shelf.  This is the first one we've ever gotten in our career, our first fair article.  We've gotten our fair share of unfair articles.  Usually my parents call me and say, you're in the paper again, and it's like, oh great,  to describe me this time besides asshole and toxic twins. 
[01:30]
 You know, we've had the worst articles written about us over the years.  Yeah, this and David Hinckley actually decided to be fair and I really appreciate that.  I hate sucking up to newspaper guys, but he did a good job.  What can I tell you?  Right?  Yes.  It's more than fair.  I agree.  And he acknowledged that we're trying to do something different here at N.E.W. and there  you go.  I'm going to win a date with Opie contest like in Tiger Beat.  Shut up.  Or Teen Fab magazine. 
[02:00]
 Let me tell you something.  I like that.  Opie, a blonde guy.  Ew.  And Anthony, an asshole.  Come on.  That's what it says right there in my copy of the Daily News.  Anthony the a-hole.  Look, it's right there.  You wrote that in yourself.  Yeah, I also, look what I did to your face.  Get out of here.  Don't try to.  You know, you've got to draw the organs.  You're a pimp.  Well, your picture is set up for me to draw something. 
[02:30]
 Yeah, obviously.  It's set up for a lot of things.  Great.  But I'll tell people to draw on Opie's face and fax it into us.  Well, you can do that.  I want to see what it looks like.  We don't take ourselves seriously.  If you want to do that today, the fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  If you want to take our pictures from the Daily News article, page 45, and do something  stupid with it, we'll accept the abuse today.  Why not?  Why not?  Sure.  Okay.  Also, on the show today, very exciting.  Very, very exciting.  We've got more tickets to give away to Pearl Jam.  Yeah, and we're going to be doing it so that people on the phones can win today. 
[03:00]
 Yeah, we promised that earlier in the week.  We got a little wacky with some of our contests.  We asked for rubles for Pearl Jam tickets.  Yesterday, we asked for livestock, and we got livestock in the studio for the tickets.  And today, we're going to give the people a chance that can't get to the studio in time  to win these things, right?  But it's not going to be, you know, hey, who plays the seventh caller?  No, no.  No, no.  You're going to have to earn your keep.  Honestly, your first chance to win will be the next time we talk.  Okay.  And I think the first one is going to revolve around, no, no, I'll wait. 
[03:30]
 Oh.  But it'll be a phone.  It'll be some form of a phone.  Okay.  If that makes sense.  I don't know if it does, but okay.  212-757-1027 is the request line.  We've got the instant feedback set and ready to go.  WNEW.com.  Click on our little pictures and yeah, you can email us right here.  Yeah, all this things.  People can see what we look like now.  Well, that's it.  Because on the NAW side, we had our baby pictures.  The anonymity is over, OP.  Great. 
[04:00]
 It's out there now.  All right.  On the way, we got Matchbox 20 and Led Zeppelin X.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with Marcy Playground and Sexton Candy.  It's OP and it's Anthony.  And you guys suck out there.  You really do.  This is pretty good.  The boss doesn't want me to use the word suck out anymore, but I got to say you guys suck.  We're getting tooled.  This is a pretty funny caption.  Yeah.  If you don't, the Daily News did an article on OP and Anthony today and page 45 on the 
[04:30]
 Daily News and just some wacky pictures with the article.  Wacky.  I know.  And you guys are coming up with captions and stuff and emailing them in to us.  My favorite is this one.  Jimmy from Queens.  Is this how OP and Anthony got their job at NEW?  Thank you.  Yeah, my mouth wide open.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I appreciate that.  Yes.  And the instant feedback is getting involved in this too, Ed? 
[05:00]
 Yeah.  We were saying, you know, your picture, OP, obviously right off the cover of Tiger Beat  or Teen, maybe.  I think it's more like Blade.  Who wrote that?  Let me click it up.  Bill.  Bill, thanks, Bill.  Man, your picture's not much better.  You got one eye.  I got one eye.  You got a glass eye.  I was kind of putting my eyebrow up.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Well, if you want to continue sending in the captions, I guess we can handle it for a little 
[05:30]
 longer.  212-957-WNEW.  Did you see David Wells last night?  Wow.  Was that one of the most exciting games of the year except for the time he did throw the  perfect game earlier this year?  Yeah.  I was in a sandwich shop and every pitch the place was going nuts.  And then he gave up that single up the middle and I was like, it was almost like a relief  because I couldn't handle it.  I know.  David Wells actually, they interviewed him after the game and he said he was relieved 
[06:00]
 that he finally gave up a hit in the seventh inning yesterday.  It's true because you're watching and you're just on the edge of your seat.  It was so cool though.  Every pitch.  He retired 20 in a row.  Well, everyone knows the story, but it was just amazing last night.  Yeah.  And then on top of that, McGuire hitting two homers last night.  57 he's up to.  He's now got the NL record.  And Sosa's gone to over 55.  I know.  They've barely talked about poor Sosa.  I'm starting to believe that whole racism thing that this thing is going on.  Yeah.  Some of the reporters have brought it up that the good old boys that run baseball simply 
[06:30]
 don't want Sosa to break the record.  They would rather have a, you know, guy like McGuire.  Yeah.  White guy.  Yeah.  With the record.  Yeah.  So they're saying that they're not really paying much attention, but I don't think that really matters.  I'm going to go on record.  I want Sosa.  You do?  I want Sosa to break the record.  All right.  But did you see the crowd going crazy for the baseball just like you brought up two weeks  ago?  Every time he hits another home run, it gets a little worse.  As he gets closer to the record, it gets a little worse.  I saw a guy almost kill himself last night. 
[07:00]
 He went diving for this ball over seats that had blue tarps over him, and he flew through  a seam and his legs are sticking straight up in the air.  And when he hits him into a crowd, forget about it.  People go crazy.  And they're saying this ball, when he does break the record, because at this point it's  looking very good for Mark unless he pops a muscle again like he does every year.  But they're saying the ball is going to be worth over a million dollars, the ball that  breaks the record. 
[07:30]
 Yeah.  Think of a poor little kid.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, you imagine if a little kid catches the ball, you don't think somebody is going  to try to rip it out of his arm?  Of course they will.  Or just rip the whole arm off and go running with the ball?  Take the whole kid.  Yeah.  Just grab him.  They've got to be figuring out something right now.  Maybe put a ton of security guards in the stands or something because it is going to  get nuts.  It's like dropping a lottery ticket in the middle of, let's say, Manhattan that's worth  a million dollars.  The big crowd.  You go, here you go.  Here's a million dollars.  What do you think is going to happen? 
[08:00]
 People are going to go crazy.  So there you go.  All right.  We've got to give away the Pearl Jam tickets.  We're going to have fun with these tickets.  We've got at least five, six pairs to give away today.  I've lost track to be honest with you.  Oh, is Pearl Jam a hot ticket?  Oh yeah.  It's a hot ticket.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Yes, it is.  So we're going to do that for you.  Here's the deal.  You've got to be quick.  All right.  The first pair of tickets goes to the person who faxes us his face.  Put your name and phone number on there.  Put your name and your phone number and fax your face right now. 
[08:30]
 Not a picture of your face, your actual face.  So you've got to go to the copier, get that picture of your face and fax it into us.  First person through the fax machine will win a pair of tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Get your name and number so we can call you back on the fax.  All right?  The fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  First person to fax their face, close your eyes, will win the Pearl Jam tickets  because if you don't close your eyes, you're not going to see the show.  You'll be there, but you won't see the show.  Just seeing blue light. 
[09:00]
 Yeah.  On the way, we got Tragically Hip by request and REM next.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York with Tragically Hip  and that's poets from their Phantom Power CD.  REM before that from Automatic for the People.  It's Opie, it's Anthony.  Hey, do we have a winner, Anthony?  Yes, we do, Opie.  All right.  Congratulations to Ron Daniels.  He's going to see Pearl Jam.  I don't even think Ron knows yet because we didn't even call him,  but we were looking for the first person to fax his face.  So we do have a winner, so stop faxing your faces because you're really scaring us. 
[09:30]
 He did it right.  Yeah.  He put his face right in the copy machine first, smushed it, and it's got this...  Man, copy machines weren't meant for photography.  No.  You could see every pore in his face.  He looks dead.  I know.  His nose is smushed over to the right.  His lips...  I don't even know how you describe that.  He looks like a dead man.  Let me see.  Look.  No, that's how Ron looks.  He didn't squish his face.  Oh.  Just kidding, Ron. 
[10:00]
 But you do have the tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Someone will be calling you in the very near future.  All right.  And everyone else, stop faxing your face.  Yeah.  Ladies, if you want to fax your boobs, that's another story.  That'd be very nice, actually.  That would help us through the day, yes.  Another fax here came through.  Call me.  I want to show my boobs on the Today Show, Claire.  Would you explain this to me?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[10:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[11:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's right.  We did say if it happened this week we will throw in the Pearl Jam tickets as well.  A little extra bonus for you.  How about that?  All right.  And if you say you did it and we check our videotape and go, wow, look at that. 
[11:30]
 It's her.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's Terrorist Boobie with Hopi and Anthony all over New York City.  So it's coming to a neighborhood near you soon, hopefully.  All right.  We've got to give away more Pearl Jam tickets.  We're looking for someone who could get a hold of their significant other, if that makes  sense.  But don't do it now.  No, no, no.  We're going to play a little game.  No, no, no, no, no.  Actually, the phones are already ringing.  They don't have time to call the significant other and set it up because they don't know 
[12:00]
 what we're looking for.  Exactly.  But if you could get a hold of your wife, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your husband,  whatever, it doesn't matter.  We'll give you a chance to win Pearl Jam tickets if you play our little game correctly.  All right.  Also, on the way we've got Barb Martin.  Marley.  Bob Marley.  Thank you.  That's the guy.  And the most requested song of the afternoon, Sean Mullins next.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Hopi and Anthony. 
[12:30]
 They got the footage of Mark McGuire hitting his homers last night.  And just like you said, people are practically killing themselves to get the home run ball.  Diving over seats.  It's crazy.  Here it is again.  Bob Dita 7!  Look at the arms on that guy.  Look at this.  They got security guards.  It's going to get ugly when the record gets closer because everyone wants that ball that's  worth over a million dollars at this point.  There it is.  The whole nation is starting to talk about this.  They're going to start interrupting TV shows just to show you at bat and McGuire's at bat.  Of course.  It's history.  Very, very cool.  All right.  What were we playing there?  Because that's the first time we've seen a guy hit a home run.  It's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

What a mess  of a woman but for some reason when I was just a kid she turned me on. She grew up to 
[19:30]

And while we get a contestant  for our next contest. Once again we should acknowledge the Daily News for their lovely  little article they wrote on you and I Anthony. Yes yes finally press that isn't completely 
[23:30]
 negative. Yeah it pains me but I got to thank David Hinckley from the Daily News for writing  a somewhat positive article. It's fair. It's a very fair article on our show and it's on  page 45 of the Daily News and there we are in all our glory. Now you know what we look  like. Oops. Because on the WNEW website we've had our baby pictures for the last two and 
[24:00]
 a half months. Well we can't hide anymore. Opi's got his mouth open like a five dollar  hooker. You're an ass. At least I don't look like I have a glass eye on page 46. Your picture  you look like Sandy Duncan. I don't know I got a Rico Suave look in it. Oh yeah real  Suave. I got one eye open kind of. Yeah because Quint something got stuck in the other one.  Oh that's the problem. Oh just figure it out yourself Anthony. But thank you for the article. 
[24:30]
 I mean we won't rehash it if you want to read it for yourself. You know pick up the Daily  News but I don't know it's kind of weird we're just not used to positive press. Me and Anthony  when there's an article about us it usually has like fired under our pictures or the two  holes or toxic twins. That was one of my favorites. Hide your teenage daughters was another quote  in an article in the past but alright one that's kind of positive so. Hey thanks. I'm 
[25:00]
 sure we'll get some negative ones. Sure. In the near future so we won't let you down.  We just haven't been here long enough. No but there you go very good. Lovely pictures.  I look like a deer caught in headlights but alright. Wow look at that dread from Hampstead.  He's instant feedbacking us here. What does Dred say. I used to think you guys sucked.  I mean I hated your show but like fungus you grew on me. Alright that's acceptable. And  like any good fungus I can't get rid of you. Thanks Dred. Thanks Joe we definitely appreciate 
[25:30]
 it. Yeah we're building a tiny little army here. Yeah a very small tiny little army.  It's got a start up. I don't think we could take on any country the army we're building  but maybe we could take on Rhode Island or something. We're pathetic. But we do have  tickets to see Pearl Jam and Rick says we got a contestant on the line. His name is  Rob. Now Rob can't hear us right now right. He's in the cold of silence or whatever. Yes. 
[26:00]
 Okay very good. Earlier we played a game have you been drinking where you get someone on  the line they call their significant other they act drunk and if the other person you  know said hey are you drunk or have you been drinking. You know we gave him Pearl Jam tickets.  We did that already. Yes but we got up the ante here. Rob's on hold. You want him you  want him to play. Have you been masturbating. How the hell do you do that. Well Rob can't  hear us right. No. Okay Rob will. They believe he's doing it and if his wife or girlfriend 
[26:30]
 says Rob are you masturbating or any form of that I guess. Okay. Then we'll give him  the Pearl Jam tickets. That's pretty embarrassing. Yeah let's do that. I don't think Rob knows  what he's got in store for himself here. Hey Rob. Hello. Can we get a hold of your significant  other. Yes we can. What's your name. Sarah. Sarah. Do you really want to go see Pearl Jam.  You better believe it. Okay. We got a new game. What is it. You got to make Sarah say 
[27:00]
 are you masturbating. Okay. I'm serious. I'm serious too. All right. Now you got to do  it. Yeah I know I got to do it. You can't say it's a radio contest. Can't say you're  trying to win tickets. Just when we get Sarah on the line here just make believe you're  doing it. If she says are you masturbating you're going to go to Pearl Jam. Got you.  All right. All right. We're going to give her a call right now. Let's do it. Here we  go Rob. Speak up too all right. Okay. This is Sarah. Oh yeah. What's going on. Oh Sarah.

What did he  say to you in the hallway. I don't know. No one wanted to know because they read the  article and it said that Scott was asked about I guess doing impressions of him. Yeah. And  he just shook his head. He didn't even give a quote for the paper. He just shook his head. 
[30:00]
 He shook his head to a reporter. Not a news camera. A reporter with a notebook in his  hand. He shook his head. Somebody emailed us earlier too saying was it shaking his head  in disgust or shaking his head in appreciation. I don't know. We're not really sure. He hasn't  given us the thumbs up or the thumbs down at this point. It's disgust. It's disgust.  He just opened the door and yelled that. All right. Thank you. All right. Sorry sir. All 
[30:30]
 right. I got some interesting news for the month of September. September. Yes. You're  going to be very shocked when I tell you this but September is International Gay Square  Dancing Month. International Gay Square Dancing Month. Why does that have to be like a gay  square dancing month. Why can't it be square dancing month. Why does anyone even square  dance is what I want to know and why when I was in school did we have to do square dancing 
[31:00]
 instead of playing like baseball or basketball. Remember that. What was that about. That was  unbelievable. I had to square dance. They pull all the guys and girls into the gym and  then they line you up. This coed gym at that age was unreal. This was Elwood Junior High  and they lined up the girls and everyone's palms were all sweaty and they made you square  dance and then everybody would go all right move me down three because I want to dance  with her. Okay take places with me. I got stuck with like I think it was Pam Bernfeld. 
[31:30]
 Pam Bernfeld. She was taller than everybody. She was like six feet tall and her palms were  really sweaty and she lined herself up with me because I think she liked me back then  and it was horrible because I didn't even want to deal with square dancing. I just wanted  to keep climbing the gym ropes. That felt good. It really did. It's like whoa I could  use this thing for something else. That's how I discovered it. What is this feeling. I got 
[32:00]
 to go somewhere right now. Remember that. I certainly do. Anyway it's September International  Gay Square Dancing Month. They got a phone number here and I've been trying to call them  all afternoon. You have? What are you making an appointment over? No I want to see what  this is all about. You want to square dance? Why are gay people getting together and square  dancing all month long? I don't know. It's a month long thing. You got any music? Maybe  I could do some calls. You want to do some calls for gay square dancing? Yeah. I guess 
[32:30]
 the calls would have to be a little different. Maybe. Because if they're making a whole separate  month just for gay square dancing it can't be like regular square dancing. Alright. You  got something? I don't know. Just a hick ill billy banjo. You got something? Alright I  got a banjo. Alright let's give this a try. These are what? Calls?

You're  going to get a big rig. Promenade and grab a beer. Open it in your partner's rear. Wait  come on man. I don't think you're doing those type of calls. Why you don't know? I don't

Why are you imitating Elvis Presley?  If he says that you will win tickets to see Pearl Jam. Okay. And you got a minute to do it. You can't say you're  calling for a radio station or trying to win tickets. None of that. You can't say, Hey, who do I sound like, baby? 
[37:30]
 Let me hear your Elvis impression. I don't know if I can do it. Go ahead. You're going to lose. Wait, let me think for a minute.  Who's snarling you live there, honey? Talk about honka honka burning love and blue suede shoes. Oh my God, I'm hysterical.  This is so funny. Honka honka burning love. Yeah. There you go. You want to try it or what? What the hell?

They told me you were going to say I sounded like I was on drugs.  You've got to be kidding me. No, I'm not kidding you. We wanted her to, you know, sound like Elvis and to have you say, why do you sound like Elvis? 
[39:00]
 She's kidding. She's kidding. Sounding nothing like Elvis. I know. This is so cool.  All right. Congratulations, guys. Hold on the line for a sec. Okay.  Opie and Anthony rock New York.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. Brian Sets her orchestra. Jump Jiving Whale. Cheryl Crowe before that.  From her CD, The Globe Sessions. And my favorite mistake, it's Opie and Anthony. You've got a horrified look on your face, pal.  I'm just looking at the USA Today life section and they did a whole article on what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago. 
[39:30]
 What was it? The pipe. No, they got a whole article on it? Yeah.  And it seems that some of our information, Opie, might have been a little amiss. A little amiss? Yeah.  Come on. Well, we were saying when a guy reaches around 40 years old, he goes to the doctor for a checkup.  The doctor recommends the pipe, meaning a colon exam where a probe is inserted through the rectum and up about four feet up the colon. 
[40:00]
 And they could see if there's any problem in there. And we were talking about how awful that whole milestone is. Yes.  You don't want that happening. And older guys will warn younger guys that it's coming and it's just not a good experience. Right.  Well, they're saying that this whole myth that it's an awful, horrible experience is keeping people from going and getting these exams, which are very important. 
[40:30]
 Of course. To men they say 50 and older. 50 and older. So yeah, we have quite a few years here. We do have a few years left.  You came up with a comment that until it looks like a potato field in there, you're not going to get a checkup.  No, no, no. There's going to be mushrooms growing. I don't care. I'm not getting the pipe.  Well, here's the old notion that we were talking about. Okay.  Says some men experts say are still living with the notion that the colon exams involve a device known as the silver bullet. 
[41:00]
 To check the colon for early signs of cancer, doctors used to insert a straight metal tube through the rectum. Men cried.  Some nearly fainted people old enough to have one of these done will tell you what it feels like to have a rigid pipe put in your rectum.  Here's the truth of the matter over this fantastic sound. 
[41:30]
 Robert Davis did the story here. He's the subject.  He says she had me lie on my side. She, the doctor. That's an interesting concept. I guess the woman must really dig that.  You son of a... Depends how hot she is. </pre>
