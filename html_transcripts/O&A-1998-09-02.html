<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about a surprisingly positive Daily News article, a stark contrast to their usual negative press coverage.  This led directly into a series of increasingly ludicrous contests to give away Pearl Jam tickets.  These included a contest requiring listeners to fax a picture of their face, a phone call prank where the hosts questioned a listener's significant other about their sobriety ("have you been drinking?"), and a truly bizarre "erotic Price is Right"-style game featuring a rectal stimulator as a prize.  The hosts then shifted to a discussion of the Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa home run chase, the resulting public mania, and a listener's outlandish plan to flash their breasts on the Today Show for money and Pearl Jam tickets. More ticket giveaways followed, utilizing equally bizarre methods such as a "have you been masturbating?" phone call game and an Elvis impersonation contest. The show also briefly mentioned upcoming musical guests.  A discussion of childhood crushes (Marcia Brady and Genie Francis for Opie and Anthony respectively) segued into a reading of a USA Today article downplaying the discomfort associated with colonoscopies. Throughout the entire segment, the broadcast was characterized by crude humor and sexually suggestive material.

[00:05:30]  longer 212-957-WNEW did you see david wells last night wow oh was that one of the most exciting  games of the year except for the time he did throw the perfect game earlier this year yeah i was in  a sandwich shop and every pitch the place was going nuts and then he gave up that single up the  middle i was like oh it was almost like a relief because i couldn't handle it i don't i know david  wells actually they interviewed him after the game and he said he was relieved that he finally gave up 
[00:06:00]  a hit uh in the seventh inning yesterday it's true because you're watching and you're just on the  edge of your seat it was so cool every pitch every pitch he retired 20 in a row well everyone knows  the story but it was just amazing last night yeah and then on top of that mcguire hitting two homers  last night 57 he's up to he's now got the nl record and uh sosa's gone to a 55 i know they've  barely talked about poor sosa i'm starting to believe that whole uh racism uh thing that they're  saying is going on yeah some of the reporters have brought it up that the good old boys that 
[00:06:30]  run baseball simply don't want sosa to break the record they would rather have a brutal guy like  mcguire yeah white guy yeah uh with the record yeah so uh they're saying that they're not really  paying much attention but i don't think that really i'm gonna go on record i want sosa you do i want  sosa to break the record all right but did you see the crowd going crazy for the baseball just like  you brought up two weeks ago every time he hits another home run it gets a little worse as he gets  closer to the record it gets a little worse i saw a guy almost kill himself last night he went diving 
[00:07:00]  for this ball over seats that had blue tarps over him and he flew through a seam and his legs are  sticking straight up in the air and and when they hit him when he hits him into a crowd yeah forget  about it people go crazy and they're saying this ball when he does uh break the record because at  this point it's looking very good for mark unless he you know pops a uh muscle again like he does every  year but they're saying the ball's gonna be worth over a million dollars the ball that breaks the  record yeah people will kill for that ball think of a poor little kid yeah you imagine if a little 
[00:07:30]  kid catches the ball you don't think somebody is gonna try to rip it out of his arm or just rip the  whole arm off and go running with the ball with to take the whole kid yeah just grab them they got  to be figuring out something right now maybe put a ton of security guards in the stands or something  because it is going to get nuts it's like dropping a lottery ticket in the middle of let's say manhattan  that's worth a million dollars a big crowd you go here you go yeah here's a million dollars what 
[00:08:00]  do you think is going to happen people are going to go crazy so there you go all right we got to  give away the pearl jam tickets we're going to have fun with these tickets we got at least five six  pairs to give away today i've lost track to be honest with you oh is pearl jam a hot ticket oh yeah  it's a hot ticket yeah yeah i think so yes it is so we're going to do that for you here's the deal  you got to be quick all right the first pair of tickets goes to the person who faxes us his face  put your name and phone number on there put your name and your phone number and fax your face right

[00:39:30]  what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago what was the pipe no they got a whole article on it  yeah and it seems that some of our information opie might have been a little amiss a little amiss  yeah we were well we were saying when a guy reaches around 40 years old he goes to the doctor  for a checkup the doctor recommends the pipe meaning a uh colon exam where a probe is inserted 
[00:40:00]  through the rectum and up about uh four feet up the colon and they could see if there's any problem  and we were talking about you know how awful that whole milestone is yes you don't want that happening  and and older guys will warn younger guys that it's coming and it's just it's not a good experience  right well they're saying that this whole myth that it's an awful horrible experience is keeping 
[00:40:30]  people from going and getting these exams which are very important of course to men they say 50 and over  50 and older so yeah we we have quite a few years here we do have a few years left uh you came up with  a comment that until it looks like a potato field in there you're not going to get a check  no no no there's gonna be mushrooms growing i don't care i'm not getting the pipe well here's the  old uh notion that we were talking about okay says some men experts say are still living with the 
[00:41:00]  notion that the colon exams involve a device known as the silver bullet to check the colon for early  signs of cancer doctors used to insert a straight metal tube through the rectum men cried some nearly  fainted people old enough to have one of these done will tell you what it feels like to have a rigid pipe  put in your rectum here's the truth of the matter over this fantastic sound uh robert davis did the uh story 
[00:41:30]  here he's the subject uh she he says she had me lie on my side she the doctor that's an interesting  concept i guess the woman must really dig that oh you son of a depends how hot she is for all those </pre>
