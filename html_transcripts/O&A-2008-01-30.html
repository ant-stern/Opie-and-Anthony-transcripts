<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a self-congratulatory introduction highlighting their controversial nature, followed by Opie's angry tirade against the pressure to be "nice" in radio, punctuated by a profane insult directed at a nameless female celebrity.  In-studio guests included Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly.  A substantial portion of the show focused on the pre-show chaos and the producers' anxieties, with Steve, the producer, becoming the target of derogatory humor and comparisons to an abused woman.  Rich Voss's revelation of having kidney cysts prompted insensitive but humorous banter.

A lengthy segment dissected the "mancrush.com" website, provoking crude and inappropriate reactions from the hosts and guests, particularly regarding Tom Brady's attractiveness; Bob Kelly even admitted to a "mancrush" on him.  Other topics included the Boston mayor's premature Super Bowl victory parade planning, a giant pencil that appeared in St. Louis, and criticisms of perceived biases in television commercials and news coverage, with accusations of racial and gender stereotyping.

The show then revisited their infamous "War Against WABU-TV," playing a 1996 tape documenting a three-day stunt where, dressed in military fatigues, they retaliated against the station for cancelling their show, "Real Rock TV," by dropping bras from a hot air blimp.  The hosts, along with Jimmy, Bob Kelly, and Rich Voss, reacted with intense embarrassment to their past selves, highlighting awkward catchphrase attempts ("brother man," "F-U-A-B-U we hate you," "Mother Hucker"). Listener calls further emphasized the absurdity of the event, drawing comparisons to a "drugged-up John Tesh."  A significant portion of the 1996 audio, including a humorous encounter with a police helicopter, was played.

This segment flowed directly into a discussion of their 12-year-old "bombing" of WABU-TV using paint-filled water balloons and bras ("bra bombs") dropped from a blimp.  Audio from the original event, filled with shouting, catchphrase attempts, and descriptions of the chaotic scene, was played.  The hosts discussed their piloting ineptitude and the event's absurdity.  Upcoming comedy shows for Bob Kelly and Mike Voss were mentioned.  Further audio from past shows, including "Sperm Bowl '96," a segment detailing a self-masturbation and sperm count competition with a car crash side bet, was also played.  Listener feedback, both positive and negative, was included.

The show heavily featured "Sperm Bowl 96," revisiting a 1996 recording of the competition between Opie and Anthony to determine who had the higher sperm count. Don Newton, the "official judge," was present in studio during the 1996 segment playback, providing commentary.  The segment involved the hosts running through the station with specimen cups to their office for testing.  Their reactions to the recording were filled with laughter, self-mockery, and reminiscing, referencing the blimp stunt.  A phone call with Kippy Love, conducting a coin toss to determine who went first, was included.  The hosts discussed using various devices to facilitate the process.  Anthony completed his sample first.  Opie's attempt was described in detail, highlighting his emotional distress and insecurities.  The results (Anthony: 3,210,000; Opie: 2,675,000) were revealed later.  The show concluded with banter, humorous listener emails, and promotional plugs, including a bizarre car dealership commercial.  Jim Norton also recounted and was mocked for an embarrassing audition tape for a Tim Allen movie.  A soundbite featuring a man gushing over his own physique was played and ridiculed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wow, Jesus, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Usually I'm alright.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning.  I can't help it.  Oh my gosh.  Wow.  Oh my God, my eyes are tearing.  I think the celebrities, especially people like a Hugh Fledger...  This boring bitch makes Ambien look like methamphetamine. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  Shut up, you f***.  You f***ing moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Alright.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be...  What?  Um...  Employed.  Employed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We've got a full house today. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  We weren't sure Jim Norton was going to be back from filming a movie.  So we invited Bob Kelly and Rich Voss to come by.  And then Jim Norton called late last night or whatever.  And we found out he was going to be here.  And we said, ah.  Let's just keep it how it is and have a full show today.  The consummate professional James Norton.  I have to take Dave sometimes.  I try to take him.  I don't have to.  That's why when I do have to take him, I don't want to get yelled at. 
[00:02:00]  Get yelled at by who?  That's a good point.  We don't even have a boss.  No boss.  Who's going to yell at you for not being here?  Who's going to notice?  Did you guys hit Steve?  Did we hit Steve?  He's such a panicky...  Oh, I know.  He's the worst.  Can I tell you these texts I have?  Scroll, scroll.  I've never seen a more frightened man.  He's like an abused woman.  This is only part of the conversation we had about...  I wasn't sure what's coming in. 
[00:02:30]  Jim, do you know for sure you got a seat on a plane tonight?  This is after I said I'm coming.  I said, I'm on my way to the airport.  Have one guy in.  And he was...  I was like, he said, we have a couple guys in.  I'm like, have one guy in just in case.  My flight's already delayed.  A minute later.  Okay, so you have a spot on the plane.  Just not sure when it's landing, right?  And I put back, correct.  And then later he goes, okay.  Voss will be in at six.  And I will tell Bob to come in as well.  He got Boston gigs he wants to promote.  Voss had been booked for two weeks. 
[00:03:00]  And then this morning.  You're coming in this morning, sweetie?  And that's how you executive produce.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It's so funny you mention that because just before the show, Steve comes up to me.  He goes, good news.  Vinnie Brandt could come in a day early.  I didn't say...  I didn't preface that with good news.  You put it...  Yes.  Good news.  You won't believe this.  Sit down.  I did not preface that with good news.  Vinnie Brandt.  We got a big coup.  Yes. 
[00:03:30]  He's going to be able to come in a day early.  I'm like, you do realize he's not a star, right?  Absolutely.  He's just a schmuck that runs a comedy club that we promote from time to time.  I was just being thorough with Jim.  But it was like he was saying, good news, we got Hillary for Tuesday.  No, it's Vinnie Brandt and his dumb chicken wings and his stupid prank phone call that  he does.  Is he coming in to cut promos?  Yeah, really.  He just gets in everyone's way.  Don't forget his new paninis.  Yeah.  That's right.  I was just being thorough with Jim because he had all these backup guys and I still 
[00:04:00]  hadn't gotten a clear answer from Jim.  And I was getting at the time that I was getting...  Anyway, good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, that had to hurt.  Our phone number is 877-212-ONA.  We do have Rich Voss who's...  Do you have cancer?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, Jesus.  He's explaining some horrific thing first thing in the morning as I'm trying to eat  a popped heart.  The cancer music.  What is wrong with you?  Some kidney problems, that's all. 
[00:04:30]  You're talking about like cysts, which in my mind, I just assume that's got to be a tumor  and it's got to be cancerous.  Not the tumor.  I didn't say tumor, I said cyst.  All right.  Is a cyst...  Can a cyst turn into a tumor?  Good news, Vinnie Brandt's going to be working on it, so that's the good news.  Right.  You got something wrong, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, cysts on my kidney.  So, I mean, I don't want to start to show off on a downer.  I got two kidneys.  Actually, this is on a huge one, right?  That's nice.  Welcome.  What could cause a cyst? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  What could cause it?  Yeah, they said it's not cancer.  They assured him that it probably was not cancer.  Yeah.  There's only like a 50-50.  A 50-50.  I don't know.  Well, maybe like some kind of like cyst gods.  How do I know what could cause it?  Yeah, you don't know where that comes from.  You know, and they bounce you from one doctor to another.  You know, and yesterday I met the doctor's office.  He says, look, it's okay.  You can live your...  You know, do what you do on a daily basis. 
[00:05:30]  Work out.  You know, live this final month normally.  Then I get a call last night.  You know, I was looking at your charts.  Don't do sit-ups.  You know, and all of a sudden, now I'm Bobby Kelly.  Because you're dying.  Don't make fun of me.  Yeah, really.  Bobby Kelly's going to a trainer.  Yeah.  Rich Voss.  Did your doctor suggest that Bonnie start dating?  That's right.  I did.  I got to get excited again.  You know, she's got a kid to raise. 
[00:06:00]  She's got to get out there.  Get out there.  She probably has a can of cyst juice pouring in your cereal.  So what are they going to...  Are they going to operate?  What are they going to do with this thing?  Yeah, I don't know.  They'll probably operate her.  Yeah.  Maybe have Bobby.  You sure have a lot of answers.  You sure, like, questioned your doctor and got some answers here.  Oh, you know, because they said, you know, it's...  He said they got to go to a urologist now.  And then I have to get a sonogram. 
[00:06:30]  I already had a CAT scan.  And, you know, I have to...  My CAT's fine.  So when are you going for your sonogram?  I'm going to make an appointment for Monday, hopefully.  In between, you know.  Like, because this week...  I wanted to do it this week, but I got to go.  I'm at the Funny Bone in Hartford all week, so I can't do it then.  Funny Bone.  Maybe you should, like, maybe put off a gig or...  Well, yeah, I'm going to make it for Monday.  Yeah?  Okay.  Maybe the Funny Bone caused the cyst on your kidney.  Yeah.  You were nervous.  Wow.  A little too nervous or something.  I wish I could... 
[00:07:00]  I wish you weren't the main guy so I could just smash you for that.  Oh, shut up.  You can smash me all you want, you ass.  But Kenny said there's no Funny Bone.  Huh?  Yeah, there is.  We figured it.  Huh?  What did you say?  In his body.  In his body.  Oh.  How did you find out you had a cyst?  Did you just get pains or something?  Can you go through, Jim, and let him ask me?  I really don't want to ask you directly.  Like, listen, you're in a Funny Bone.  Relax. 
[00:07:30]  Shut up.  I've been in pain the whole week.  What I was going to do to get rid of it was just have Bobby perform in front of it and  have him get up and walk out.  Oh, damn.  You've got to give him that one, man.  You've got to give him that one.  That was all right.  Let him talk.  He'll bomb, though.  Yeah, now just stay right there.  Stay.  Just stop right there, boss.  Take a seat.  We should take you out of the game.  You did good.  You did real good right there.  Enjoy the moment.  Relish it.  Right.  Don't try another three-pointer anytime soon. 
[00:08:00]  It's coming.  Look at him.  I know.  He's sitting there like a monk just itching right now.  He's starting to think he might be LeBron James.  All right.  Very, very.  He's attacking me this morning.  What the hell did I do to you?  I'm the only friend you have.  There's a lot going on in the world today, and we've got breaking news.  This is just amazing.  Sit back and listen to this.  You're not going to believe it.  All right, check out this number two that's actually number one.  I'm talking pencil, folks. 
[00:08:30]  It's the world's largest pencil.  It arrived in my hometown, St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday.  Ooh, joy.  It weighs in at 22,000 pounds and it's 76 feet long, and it costs $20,000 to make.  The pencil is so big it had to be split in two for the trip from New York to the City Museum in St. Louis.  This museum specialist now had the huge task of putting it back together.  The man who made it says he has not yet made the world's largest sharpener to go along with it. 
[00:09:00]  That's funny.  That's so funny.  It's a big pencil.  How many things you got to write for this?  Good golly.  Can you take the SATs with this?  Oh, look at me.  Big pencil.  You didn't need Teamsters.  Just take an SAT test, they think.  Oh, who's carrying that behind their ear?  Oh, good.  Pencil coming through, folks.  Enough with the big freaking blank records.  The non-story. 
[00:09:30]  Stop.  Well, they continued, though.  My question would be, yeah, my question would be, why?  Yeah, there's somebody commissioned.  And knowing the folks in St. Louis, they probably looked at that and went, what?  I think it said happy birthday on the side of it, so maybe it was somebody.  Happy birthday, what did it say?  Happy birthday number two, the pencil.  Oh, well, see, we missed an entire historic perspective on the birthday of the number two pencil.  We're guessing.  It could be somebody else's birthday.  All right, let's go over to Jill. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Pencil flies through their window and takes their eyes out.  Okay, there I go.  Hey, I knew it was coming.  What window?  They're in a newsroom.  You should have had your sis say it.  They're commenting on the pencil.  I don't know how silly it is, but they're doing a story on it.  It's probably the worst.  And we're friendly with some people over there, but quite possibly the worst. 
[00:10:30]  We're not friendly with anybody.  No?  We think the traffic girl has nice boobs.  She was very nice, Jill Nicolini.  Yeah, but we don't want to hang out with them or anything.  We just admire her boobs like anyone else, although it looks like she's a little smaller today.  What's that about?  Stripes.  She's wearing stripes.  No, that TV is not in regular mode.  Everything's being squished.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I noticed that the other day.  Including her boobs.  It's not fixed.  So anyway, what were you going to say?  We have friends over there.  Yeah, but it could be quite possibly the worst newscast in the whole country. 
[00:11:00]  They cover stories that no one cares about, like the pencil, and then they'll goof on the  fact that who cares about the pencil, but they're reporting on it.  Right.  I think the worst newscaster is New York One, that black guy who reads the news like he's  dead.  They're supposed to be kind of like NPR, I think.  Or they're not supposed to get excited.  They're just giving you the news.  It's all news.  He makes me want to kill myself every time I watch it. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, it's quite, quite boring.  All right, and then I take a peek at the Boston Herald today.  The front page and the stupid mayor has the whole city in an uproar because he's already  planning a Super Bowl victory parade.  Oh, boy.  That's a jinx.  That's a jinx.  They got Mayor Menino on the front page of the Boston Herald.  It says, Stupor Tuesday.  Menino's parade plan puts jinx on Pat's and greatest super duper chaos. 
[00:12:00]  Chaos.  And creates.  Okay.  Oh.  I thought it was whatever.  And creates super duper chaos.  Yeah.  People are not happy that he's announcing plans for a victory parade for Tuesday.  Yeah.  It's like not smart, they're saying.  So they're not.  You don't want to count those chickens.  No.  That's where they hatch.  If I may.  Yeah, absolutely.  Ixnay.  He's an ass.  And why do you have to plan a victory parade anyway?  You can do that like, you know, they win. 
[00:12:30]  Okay, we're going to all hang out at City Hall Tuesday.  March down it.  Superstitious fan slammed the Menino administration yesterday for blabbing about preliminary plans  for a Super Bowl victory rally Tuesday.  Warning, it could jinx the perfect season.  Pat, Mayor Menino has said the city is making a contingency plan for a Patriots Super Bowl  victory bash Tuesday.  But the news has drawn pushback over worries that celebration chaos would blunt voter turnout  on Super Tuesday.  Oh, that's right.  They got to vote and celebrate a Super Bowl victory all on the same day. 
[00:13:00]  That's kind of crazy.  Meanwhile, New York City officials are tight-lipped about plans for a Giants victory march through  the streets of Gotham.  We in New York always find a way to honor our teams, but we're not going to jinx them by  discussing any plans beforehand.  Some Patriot fans are worried no good can come of it.  Bemoaned fan Mike Schuster, 45 at Foxboro.  I know they have to plan it, but they got to keep things quiet and not talk about it,  even if they have a plan.  And there you go.  So that's what they're talking about. 
[00:13:30]  Stupid mayor.  And then later on, we'll let you know the top Super Bowl snacks for this coming Super  Bowl.  Papers are just running out of things to talk about already.  That's why I think they should just play the Super Bowl the next week.  This two weeks in between is just dumb, because it gets down to them just talking about nothing.  Nothing.  Tom Brady's ankle.  No, well, he had a panty question yesterday.  He said it's fine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, some guy, I don't know, was saying how, I asked him if he would steal his sister's  girlfriend's panties or something.  What?  Some guy trying to be shocking.  He's probably some dumb stunt boy for some dumb radio show.  What the hell was the question, though?  Now I got to find it.  It's in the Herald.  Why would you steal them for what?  To sniff, obviously.  Oh.  To be a perv.  Of course.  And then Brady said, well, my sister wouldn't allow me to get close to her friends. 
[00:14:30]  Because they'd have sex with him.  That's right.  I get it.  Because he's so good looking.  Because he's Tom Brady.  That's what they tell us every day.  Shut up!  Gives a crap.  Yeah, guys that are into watching football and being guys really don't care how good  looking Tom Brady is to the girls.  I don't know, though.  I don't care.  There's a website called, we were looking at it this morning because it was in the paper.  Were we?  Because it was in the paper.  We all were. 
[00:15:00]  It's called Mancrush or mencrush.com?  Whatever.  Check E-Rock's favorites for the exact website.  Do we have the list?  Do we have the list or are they still preparing stuff for the show?  It was like the top ten guys that men have a man crush on.  Something like that.  What is this man crush thing?  What the hell is that?  Well, Nick DePaulo started it the other day, how we're just being pussified. 
[00:15:30]  Masculated.  Yeah.  Men are being pussified in the media.  After Nick was in here and talked about how men are just emasculated on television, I  took note and really watched.  And it is every single commercial that shows like a family unit.  The guy is a complete moron.  A complete moron.  I saw one.  The guy couldn't pour his own cereal.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  His wife had to come over and help him. 
[00:16:00]  It's just a great example.  Yeah, he had no arms.  What commercial is that where he had a...  I don't even know what it was for, but he was incapable of fixing his own cereal.  With my left foot.  He kept spilling the milk all over.  Getting his ankle in the...  Well, you want to hear the top ten men?  Who wouldn't?  It's mancrush.com.  So I guess these are men voting on who they have a crush on?  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  We're not allowed to kind of do the woman thing anymore.  So this is what we're left with.  So now we got...  Yeah, yeah.  It's too sexist to line up like the top ten hot chicks or something.  Right.  So now we got to turn a little homosexual and pick men?  Number ten.  Men out there voted for LeBron James.  He's hot.  What?  As a sexy mother effer, I guess. 
[00:17:00]  What?  What is a mancrush?  Do you want to have sex with these people?  Yeah, what is the criteria for this vote?  I have a mancrush that was just fat white guys with blonde hair that voted for LeBron.  That was kind of funny.  That's pretty funny.  Okay.  Do you have a crush on a man?  Yes.  His name is Dane Cook.  Yeah, obviously.  Who do you got a crush on?  I have to have that crush.  I have a huge mancrush on Tom Brady.  He really does.  He's not even kidding.  Why? 
[00:17:30]  Tom's a fruit.  Let me tell you something about Tom.  What is this?  I met him and my knees got weak when I shook his hand.  It could have been because of the weight.  The second key behind you.  Pretty much everything I threw up.  It could be belly.  Everything I threw up is a softball.  You're shaped like one.  See?  There's no way out.  Bob, you can't say it like that.  Everything I threw up is a mushy beanbag.  I think Bob does have a crush. 
[00:18:00]  Maybe if you threw up.  Why do you have a crush on Tom Brady?  Anorexia choker.  He's hot.  See, but guys aren't supposed to find other guys hot.  Tom Brady is perfect.  He's not even hot.  He's perfect.  Well, Brady's number 13, according to Mancrush.com.  Oh, my God.  Who made this list?  LeBron James is beating it.  Yeah.  LeBron James.  He looks like a black Frankenstein.  Brady has a perfect little bum chin.  His eyebrows are nice and neat. 
[00:18:30]  His hair is nice.  He's really looked into this.  This isn't even a bit.  His torso is, like, even with his legs.  His hands aren't mushed up.  They're nice hands.  You ever see him walk out?  Watch him after.  Watch any quarterback on the post-game interviews.  They're sweating still.  They just look grimy.  They got some T-shirt on.  Brady comes out looking like a supermodel.  And he changes it every week.  One week he's kind of rough with a little scally cap on.  The next week he'll come out with a suit with the napkin coming out of the pocket. 
[00:19:00]  Then they'll switch it up and just wear a black raincoat to look like New York sleek.  Do you want to kiss me or do I want to kiss you on the mouth?  You know this is not normal, right?  Oh, it's not normal at all.  When I shook his hand, I remember when I met him, I was just staring at him.  I couldn't stop staring.  And I just blurted out because he was about to leave.  I went, I'm Robert Kelly.  And I actually scared him.  Oh, God.  I actually made him, like, shake a little. 
[00:19:30]  Like, hey, how you doing?  Nice to meet you.  I was hanging out with Jimbo Wahlberg, Mark's brother.  And he, you know, he had, like, all this VIP stuff backstage.  And we went and met Belichick.  And then they took us into the locker room.  And it was...  Oh, did you see stuff there?  Yeah, guys.  A lot of...  There's just women reporters everywhere.  And just naked football players.  And just nothing. 
[00:20:00]  And football players are big guys.  It was a little creepy.  And then you see a little kicker walking out, and it's kind of cute.  Hey, guys.  Actually, it makes a different sound.  We have Bob's reaction when he met Tom Brady.  Yes.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yes, I am gay.  You talked to him in the locker room?  Well...  You were in heaven, Bob.  I was...  He walked out.  He was in a double-breasted gray suit. 
[00:20:30]  With the white napkin coming out of the pocket.  Oh, wow.  Look at the picture right there.  Oh, God.  I'm just going to get Stetson cologne and just put it on my pillow.  Is that what he wears?  He knows that he wears Stetson cologne.  He's the spokesperson.  He's the spokesperson.  I don't know that.  I know.  The only reason why I don't buy that cologne is because it reminds me...  It just smells like a molestation.  It stinks.  Stetson's horrendous.  It just smells like an older man. 
[00:21:00]  From, like, 1970s.  It's probably a sponsor.  Of course.  Oh, sorry.  No idea.  Put it on Stetson, should then pat your bottom and take it to the Woolworths counter.  It's on your hamburger.  Stetson.  It stinks.  It's from malted.  All right.  We're heading toward our first break.  We can continue with Bob Kelly and his man crush on proving this freaking website.  Yeah.  Correct.  Yeah.  I'm not...  I wouldn't have sex with Tom Brady, but I would date him.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd, like, go on a date.  All right.  Well, listen. 
[00:21:30]  And after the break, the top 10 man crushes out there that other men have.  And it started with LeBron James in 10th place.  And then there's a...  LeBron James is a drastic drop-off from number nine.  Let's just put it that way.  And we'll give you number nine all the way to number one after the break.  Counting them down.  And also, Hillary, talking like a robot after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Finger 11.  They performed this song live on our show last week. 
[00:22:00]  Opie and Anthony with ya.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about that.  Something we started many, many, many, many years ago.  It's still happening to this day.  That's what those wow stickers mean on the highways.  There are ladies that will flash their boobies if they see a wow sticker.  Well, yeah.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  That's what wow stands for.  And you can be part of the game by just throwing a wow on your car, whether it's a bumper sticker or a homemade sign.  Okay?  Easy.  Very easy.  And we got girls standing by every Wednesday. 
[00:22:30]  They want to get in and just talk about how they're looking for cars to flash.  Very, very cool.  Guys, just leave them alone, though.  They don't want to have sex with you.  Yeah.  Just take the view and leave.  That's right.  They don't want you.  Thank God wow is still happening because America is trying to pussify men in general.  Just turn us into these mushy, stupid, just nothings. 
[00:23:00]  What happened to the strong man?  It's happened in radio.  You know, we used to have a lot of like sexy things on our show and corporate's like, ah!  But then next thing you know, we're doing like weird, like man-on-man weird radio because  that's okay with corporate.  Figure that one out.  No.  But it's happening everywhere.  I mean, you know, Nick DiPaolo really brought it to our attention the other day.  And like Anthony said, you know, watching TV, you see it all the time.  The other thing you see is a strong black guy, weak white guy. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's on TV all the time.  The famous commercial where the guy's talking to his car and it plays the music and stuff  and all of a sudden the black guy's like, Michael Bolton.  And Michael Bolton, you know, kicks in because, you know, that's what a white man would listen  to.  Yeah.  Michael Bolton.  And there's one now, and you're right, there's anything that could be objectifying.  Like, there's one now where the fat white guy walks in and his black boss is sitting  there and he goes, do you have a receipt for that expense account? 
[00:24:00]  And he goes, could I just take a picture of my butt?  Is anybody sick?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's not, it's, when people talk about this, it's not like we're a bunch of paranoid  white guys.  It literally only goes that way now.  That's all we're saying.  It's like, if it was both ways, I could care less if men are made fools out of.  Brought up.  The fact that they never allow you to do it to women anymore in commercials is all we're  saying.  Brought up the other commercial for that bank where the black guy is leading around a corral  of old white men that are like the, what you think of in banking, but he's the one 
[00:24:30]  leading them around and, you know, he's got them all bamboozled.  You'll see a lot of strong black guys and weak white guys on the news.  That happens a lot.  Oh, I see what you mean.  Oh my God, boss.  And it's funny, we talk about the way it looked, but you talk about the women.  I did a thing for MTV a few years ago called Fugliest Rockstar.  It was like one of those stupid clip shows where we comment on the ugliest rock stars  and everyone was a man.  Every one. 
[00:25:00]  So I talked to her.  I'm like, how come none of these are women?  There's a lot of ugly female rock stars.  Oh my God.  And she said to me, well, that would just be mean.  I honestly got it.  She said to me, it would just be mean.  Well, what the hell is...  But that's the mentality.  Yeah.  And, you know, the boss has to be black in TV commercials now.  Because it really is TV's way of saying...  It's so weird.  Without meaning to, they're really going, this is obviously a parody of something that doesn't exist.  And it's great to have a black boss because you know he's going to be late for work. 
[00:25:30]  Just take a look for yourself, though.  I mean, start watching TV a little closer.  You see, the white man gets just effed.  And does every single court scene have to have the sassy black judge, the woman, the sassy black woman judge,  is always on the bench.  And the wire's all full of black people.  That's a good one, though.  Boy, that's great.  I'm not caught up yet, so...  Yeah, let's get back to...  So this website, it was in the paper today. 
[00:26:00]  I think it was in the Herald.  I'm not sure.  But it's called mancrush.com.  And it's like men voting on who they have a crush on.  And number 10 was LeBron James.  Number 9, you ready for this?  Yeah.  Abraham Lincoln.  Ooh.  Speaking of blacks.  Without whom?  Wow.  This is a big drop-off from 9 to 10.  Wow.  Abraham Lincoln is number 9.  LeBron James is number 10.  Wait, wait, wait.  But who's really got a mancrush on Abraham Lincoln? 
[00:26:30]  Do they explain what the mancrush is on this website?  This list was south.  Right.  This list was made up by Lincoln's wife.  First Abe, and then that one field team.  The history of mancrush.  The term mancrush is not a modern creation, contrary to popular belief.  The phrase is thousands of years old and is steeped in history and international intrigue.  No, it isn't.  The earliest ancestor of the term that has come to be known as mancrush first appeared 
[00:27:00]  on what is known as the Man Scrolls.  This is phony.  I'm not reading anymore.  Parody.  Crap.  All right.  Number 8, George Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see.  Doing the pencil story again on the news.  Number 7.  Not only did they do the pencil story, they're doing it again.  Well, they have to.  All right.  Number, I don't know how this works, but okay. 
[00:27:30]  Number 7.  Let's try it this way.  Charles Darwin.  Mm-hmm.  I have a theory about that.  Number 6, William Shakespeare.  We're going to go right through this list.  This is, like, ridiculous.  Yeah.  Number 5, Ernest Hemingway.  Well, that was a man's man.  There's no cute guys on this list, right, Bobby?  I mean, if you're a fan of the Tom Brady, I don't even know where you get your...  I mean, it doesn't make sense to me.  It's actually... 
[00:28:00]  It's aggravating me.  Yeah.  All right.  Number 4 is Teddy Roosevelt.  Or Roosevelt.  How would you get excited with any of those guys in a room?  Yeah.  Number 3 is Elvis Presley.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Number 2, because you have to have someone current on the list, is Barack Obama.  Stop.  And number 1 is...  Tom.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  They have a man crush on Jesus Christ?  Jesus Christ.  A man crush on Jesus.  He did have a good body, though. 
[00:28:30]  What?  It wasn't like he had a pot belly and boobs.  Why are you studying guys' bodies?  Jesus was in shape.  Look at his statues.  All right.  You can acknowledge that, but...  Statues.  He really is in shape.  He's an in-shape god.  He's not like Buddha.  That fat mess.  There was...  Hold on a second.  I want to talk the evening at the improv 1988 idea.  Who's a good-looking guy?  So, uh...  That's going on today.  I want to look at Bob's thin piano tie. 
[00:29:00]  My...  My...  My jacket with leather elbows.  Yeah, and sneakers.  How come Bobby's ever brought in an early tape of his set?  I would definitely bring it in.  Well, bring it in, because we've started going down that road again.  I have Al and the Monkees.  It's like me and Dane.  I did my first three years as an improv group.  Dane mentioned.  Yeah, by yourself.  Do you have it taped?  Do I have a tape of it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Bring it in.  There's a tape actually on the internet somewhere really bad about it. 
[00:29:30]  It's just awful.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving on to politics.  You got John McCain winning Florida, right?  You got Rudy Giuliani dropping out of the race.  Yeah.  Not officially, but it's pretty obvious.  He's going to support McCain.  Yep.  And he dropped out of the race.  He came in a distant third in Florida.  His strategy, they're saying, was all wrong, because he kind of missed all those early caucuses  and stuff when you're supposed to get your name out there. 
[00:30:00]  And no one was really aware of him.  So he tried too late jumping in.  He was a complete bust.  And it hurt him.  Yeah.  Everyone had high hopes.  Not everyone, but a lot of people had high hopes for Giuliani.  And what a bust.  I don't think he's presidential.  I like Rudy a lot.  I love Max.  I think that there's other guys a lot more qualified.  I think he'll get picked, though, for vice president.  Unfortunately, they're not running.  Well, do you think vice president?  I mean, maybe.  McCain.  Might be.  Oh, that could be what's happening there.  He bowed out gracefully.  He didn't make an ass out of himself. 
[00:30:30]  I just don't.  No.  You didn't hear anything about him.  Like, nobody knew what he was doing or against.  He wasn't campaigning in the last four places.  Every time you heard him speak, it was, you know.  And during 9-11, I was, yeah, we know.  Give us something else.  And he just didn't have anything else.  I would have voted for him just because he has a speech impediment.  He's my kind of guy.  You know why I can't vote for McCain?  He looks like one of those old guys that has, like, dandruff on his suits all the time.  Like an old math teacher or something.  Like, yeah.  His suits don't fit right. 
[00:31:00]  They're a little too wrinkly.  It's like, take care of your suit and get the dandruff off the shoulders.  You might be president.  They don't fit right because there was some North Vietnamese rearranging his bones.  You know, it's hard to get a suit tailored when your shoulder, your clavicle's been broken in 50 places.  Well, you look like a Salvador Dali painting.  Salvador Dali.  The good thing about him is he can't lift his arm to hit the button, so we don't have to worry about him. 
[00:31:30]  You know, I believe no matter who you throw in there, nothing really changes in the end.  So my criteria is a little different.  That's all.  I look at him and I see dandruff on his shoulders and I can't have a guy like that in the White House.  He looks like he peels, like, hunks his skin off and eats it.  Yeah, exactly.  You know this guy just picks his nose every chance he gets with that just, like, that long, getting old finger.  Left hand.  Yeah, but see, they say if you poll between, like, 35 and 60-year-old men, probably 90% of them won't vote for a woman or a black person. 
[00:32:00]  No S, Sherlock.  Oh, really?  You knew that?  Well, yeah.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah, this country's not quite.  Yeah, older white guys are going to be voting for Obama.  Liberal enough.  Oh.  He's gold member.  Huh?  He's gold member, peeling skin off himself and eating it. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, right, right, right.  Kind of looks like him.  And then you got Hillary with a big win, but they're saying that it doesn't matter that she won Florida.  No, there was no delegates.  It doesn't really matter, but she had a fine victory.  What did she get, 50%, I think?  Yeah, she won big down there.  That's obvious.  That was going to happen.  Well, the interesting thing with Hillary, she's back to talking like a robot.  Yeah, she did.  I was listening this morning, driving in, and it's like, oh, here's Hillary.  And then she's back to a robot speech.  She went, a few weeks ago, she had found her voice. 
[00:33:00]  Remember she was saying that?  She was talking like a human being and getting a little emotional and trying to be more relatable  and not as cold and frigid and just out there, uncaring politician.  And then she's back to it again.  It's horrid.  It's embarrassing watching her try to be what she thinks people want her to be.  I'm embarrassed for her.  Yeah.  She's such an insincere, fraudulent persona. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  There's no sincerity there.  You can't say, oh, this is who she is.  Because it changes.  How does she have so many people fooled?  I mean, people want a woman or a lot of people like her?  Women will vote for the woman.  And then, yeah, people like Bill Clinton, so they assume there's some tie in there.  He would make a terrific first lady.  Probably hasn't touched her in years.  In decades.  So we enjoy when Hillary, you know, talks. 
[00:34:00]  This has been a record turnout because Floridians wanted their voices.  She started to sound like China.  Thanks, McMahon.  I wanted to get my name back.  Did you?  I'm going to kick your ass.  Stupid China.  This has been a record turnout because Floridians wanted their voices to be heard on the great issues that affect our country and the world. 
[00:34:30]  I am thrilled to have had this vote of confidence that you have given me today.  There we go.  The rev up.  And I promise you I will do everything I can to make sure not only are Florida's Democratic delegates seated, but Florida is in the winning column for the Democrats in 2018.  All right, we get it. 
[00:35:00]  She's starting to sound like, kind of like a man there.  How sincere is that?  There's no emotion.  None.  Sounds like me auditioning.  You're not a good actor?  I just had to put myself on tape and send it out,  and I put the wrong address on purpose,  because I don't want them to get it.  When they see this tape,  because now they're going to have it, 
[00:35:30]  of me auditioning for this movie,  and it's just so...  Bonnie, it took me two hours,  and Bonnie goes, no, that's good,  because she just wanted to wrap it up.  Why would you send it to the wrong address?  I was just wanting to sort of real people don't see it.  I just threw that in.  But wait, what was the movie?  What's the movie?  It's a...  I don't know, it's a Tim Allen movie,  and it's a good character, you know?  I don't know.  It's just that you're sitting at the tape,  you know, I'm not going to fly to L.A.,  so I have to do it in my, you know,  living room or dining room,  and I'm sitting there, 
[00:36:00]  and it's just, you know, it's horrible.  It's almost...  You know the difference between auditioning  and actually doing it.  Give us a couple of lines.  From it?  Yeah, go ahead.  Act it out.  All right.  What's the character?  Well, it's a guy that just got out of prison.  He's working in a pizza parlor with another friend,  and, you know, they're trying to get some house painting work,  which is basically like method acting to me.  Oh, you've been there?  You know, and...  Yeah, okay.  You're almost qualified to work in a pizza place. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  All right, let me think about...  Making those little tiny pizzas.  Those hands.  All right, so a hot girl walks in.  Uh-huh.  Wow, look at her.  Tommy, check this out.  Yeah, that wasn't bad.  You would have put that on tape?  Couldn't you email us?  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:37:00]  Here's another line.  Okay, here we go.  Wow, look at that quarterback.  Bobby, check this out.  That wasn't that bad.  It wasn't.  We're all so mind-boggled that someone can't say wow naturally.  Yeah.  Especially on this show.  Wow, Mr. Faber-Sham.  W-O-W.  Rich Voss will not get that picture. 
[00:37:30]  He's a moron.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Did you do...  Did you say wow?  Wow.  No.  Did you say wow a bunch of different ways?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I bet you sat there for like an hour trying to figure out what wow to use.  Don Coalhoza here.  He could slap your face and go, if you could act, you could act like a man. 
[00:38:00]  And Steve, what do you think?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Steve didn't like it either.  Yeah, that's too bad.  All right.  Getting back to Hillary.  This is the second half of her speech.  So many of the people who talk to me every single day are worried about the economy.  They're worried about their health care.  They're worried about their college education for their children.  They're worried about whether we can restore our leadership and standing in the world. 
[00:38:30]  Well, I am convinced that with this resounding vote, with the millions of Americans who will vote next Tuesday, we will send a clear message that America is back.  And we're going to take charge back.  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.  Oh.  That's...  What is...  What?  Oh.  What.  What?  What?  What.  The same...  She can't just speak.  Get a speech from 1979.  It's the same crap.  they want the economy to be back 
[00:39:00]  they want health care  we did that bit  you find like presidential candidates  from like 20-30 years ago  it's the same crap  well unless you get  health care  huge revolution nothing's going to change  I understand  by revolution I mean you know  you vote someone in  you want to hear the crazy man  I auditioned once for Fox  for the head of casting  and they called my manager and said  we can never look at him again 
[00:39:30]  no  was it bad  I was having  it's when I was having major anxiety  and I was having anxiety attacks  right  and I guess that wasn't the character  that would have been good  if it was a character playing a guy  I was having anxiety  so I got up  I had an agent then  and I go I can't go into this audition  because I was shaking right  or without even  just from me  and she said oh you'll be fine  so I'm there  and you can see the paper like this  right  oh no  right  and I'm staring into the camera  I'm not even 
[00:40:00]  I'm not even connecting with the other  staring at the camera  everything I did wrong  and I'm shaking  right  can we do it again  no  no  they just said get out of here  it was  oh  this was 10 years ago  I love bad acting stories  it's just  we just do  comedians are the worst  like we can act  but when we have that shame moment  there's no redeeming it  I did an audition for one  and Dane's a friend of mine  and I had to go on tape  and it was horrendous 
[00:40:30]  I'm like who is this person  talking in Jim Norton's face  this is not Jim Norton  who is this guy  you know you're awful  when you're like rehearsing it  and you're miming stuff to yourself  like you're talking to the guy  I'm like I suck in my room  I'm going to be terrible  when I get there  I try to be funny on one  I walked in  they go  what would make you feel comfortable  I go  if we did this at my house  nothing  just the whole room staring at me  and it was the director  the writer 
[00:41:00]  Michael J. Fox's wife was in there  it was  it was for years ago  and they're not going to laugh  even if they thought it was funny  it was  so uncomfortable  that you just walk out  and you're in the elevator  and you're thinking  do I cry  or  what do I do  because  you know  you should have shaked a little bit  or shook  apparently she digs that  alright we got a break  Bob McCain just babbled  and said  political stuff  so I guess we don't really need to hear it  do we

[00:45:00]  react  and it was just  this over the top reaction  yeah  to what was going on  in the scene  sometimes  Norton on Lucky Louie  they should have just played  piano music over his lines  like an old silent film  reaction shots  just like  worse than Mr. Roper's  your eyes should pop out  on the strings  and pop back in  shut up  you stunk in that movie  ten times worse than I did  I had ten times more lines  I had ten times more opportunities  yes  well you were

[00:48:30]  our own acting  and uh  I heard yesterday  there was some kind of  uh discussion  of somebody's  prior performances  oh man  it  it  it's beyond  reason  how bad  this is  we uh  I would like to hear  some of it  I wasn't here yesterday  it's sort of a rebuttal  to a lot of people  who complain  that the old days  they always look at  the old days  through  may I say  rose tinted glasses  yes you may  and uh  they look at our 
[00:49:00]  our early shows  back at AAF  when we were uh  uh  doing our show  up there in  in uh  Worcester  right  and uh  they say wow  those were the days  for Opie and Anthony  that's when they put on  good radio  quality radio  it was funny  consistently  every day  and  and they  they remember  uh  these things  that just  it wasn't that way  and it sure  was proven yesterday  when we played some  tape  oh 
[00:49:30]  well it continued too  when we moved to New York  and they said  NEW was the uh  the golden years  of Opie and Anthony  it's always wherever we were  and I love reading  uh  these dopes  you know  trying to  trying to disagree  with what I was saying  yesterday  because they just  don't know  they're just  dummies  with their opinions  everyone has an opinion  and that's fine  but your  opinions alike  yeah but your opinion  is  dumb  I  I laid it all out  yesterday  and they're still  arguing on uh  on message boards  you're just stupid 
[00:50:00]  so just shut up  and enjoy the show  yeah  for example  the AAF days  right  when we  moved to New York  and then we got to  start broadcasting  back in Boston  again  like oh  you know  they're just not as good  as when they were up here  the first time  here's something about  the AAF days  we went through  hundreds and hundreds  and hundreds  of hours of uh  of uh  old you know  bits we did at AAF  and shows and stuff  to come up with  one lousy CD  yeah 
[00:50:30]  that was it  that was our  greatest hits  basically of our  AAF days  one CD that came in  around 70 minutes  how did we have a job  I don't know  playing that tape  yesterday  and then  and then with the  NAW stuff  there's a lot of people  that were turned on  to our NAW material  when we were off the air  for over two years  yeah  but this is what  I have to get into  these dummies  heads  the stuff you  you hear from the  NAW days  is the stuff that  we put out there  the greatest hits 
[00:51:00]  the good stuff  yeah  we buried all the  all the days  when we sucked  the big one  you know  yeah  the days where we  didn't feel like  being on the air  we were hung over  and we put  Jim Brewer bits on  so we could leave  early  or we come up  with excuses  why we needed  to play a really  good bit from  earlier in the week  three or four times  in one week  yeah  we used to do  that a lot  these dummies  you know  this show is  is way better  than it's ever been  and if you disagree  with that  then maybe the show 
[00:51:30]  has passed you by  what can I tell you  because we don't  have excuses anymore  we don't  we don't play bits  you know  over and over again  to fill up time  you know  we're riffing  and doing a good  radio show  every single day  some days better  than the other  of course  well that's the  nature of this  whole thing  but the tape  that we were  playing yesterday  oh my god  it's  I didn't hear  any of it  it's me  and Opie  in the studio  and  our  real rock 
[00:52:00]  TV show  it was called  was  at the last minute  yanked  from the airwaves  of a local  television station  WABU  WABU  which no one  knows  yeah  and so we got on  we were very angry  very angry  and worked up  and we had to show them  how angry we were  and show all the listeners  how angry we were  so  we  we  got a  hot air  blimp  and flew over 
[00:52:30]  the  the TV station  with bras  filled with  paint balloons  and dropped  and did a  bombing run  and we were  dressed in fatigues  and  and all this  just took place  in the studio  sell it  come on  sell it  you want to hear  some bad acting  some  some  overly  energetic  and  and  happy to be there  radio  it  it is 
[00:53:00]  so  cringeworthy  Jim  I can't  listen to it  let me ask you a question  how did your TV show  air at all  yeah  so it was on the air  for a little while  how long was it on the air for  before that  no no  see  ABU  this station up there  they picked up this  real rock TV show  and  we learned yesterday  because I forgot  Beth Hart  she had a song  called Immortal  that she  she did live  on our show  but she wasn't  wearing a bra  and she had  tiny little  I mean  nothing  nothing going on  but you could  kind of see something 
[00:53:30]  through the t-shirt  so that made  this TV station  ABU  drop the show  so then we had to  find another  wasn't that the  premiere episode  I believe so  yeah see so it  hadn't aired  so  that's when the  bra thing came in  yeah  okay  yeah so at least  there's a tie in there  and then we had to  find a  another TV station  that was a  Hispanic TV station  we were the only  hour  there was only one  hour of English  speaking programming  a week  and it was this  rock show  that we  we were the  stars of  so this is so 
[00:54:00]  bad  Jimmy you weren't  here yesterday  that E-Rock  was having fun  with this  and  making fun of us  and there was  nothing we could  say  had no defense  right  you've heard all  of it right  it's  it's the greatest  bit they've ever  done  it's so bad  there are so  many  bros  dudes  and mans  in there  yeah bro  alright dude  whoa dude  who wants to  keep track of  the dudes  the bros  the brother 
[00:54:30]  mans  I can't keep  track of  anything  during this  it's so  difficult  I'm gonna  have a hard  time not  looking at  anybody  I want  someone to  keep track  of a  good call  the bros  the dudes  the different  ways  they're called  crutches  what about  tunage  tunage  can I have  somebody  keep track  of that  alright  okay  no I  can't  I address  ant or  op all the  time and  I'll never  just go  hey fella  hey guy  it's either  hey ant  or op all  just look  and go  hey  dude 
[00:55:00]  I got  home  yesterday  and my  girl  first of all  she turned  off the show  yesterday  because she  got really  uncomfortable  she's one  of these  people when  she gets  really  uncomfortable  she has  to make  it go  away  kind of  like  you  Anthony  I can't  be in  this  situation  she asked  me as  I walked  in the  door  yesterday  she goes  why do  you get  off on  feeling so  uncomfortable  she goes  I don't  get it  you love  when other  people are  uncomfortable  around you  you love  when you're  uncomfortable  I go  I don't  know  I don't  know why  I can't 
[00:55:30]  take it  like this  tape will  make me  laugh  hysterically  it's so  uncomfortable  it'll make  me laugh  Anthony  by the end  of this  segment  we'll leave  the studio  there's no  doubt in my  mind  it is so  bad  I'm going  to give it  a chance  it's a long  time ago  see here  it is  and I  said this  yesterday  I go  Jimmy  will just  look at  us  with that  grin on  his face  and then  say something  like no  no that's  good  the way  you know  he just  he's an  ass 
[00:56:00]  when it  comes to  this stuff  he just  took off  his  body  I can  appreciate  anything else  you want to tell  Jimmy about  this tape  they had  mentioned a  lot of  the crutches  Opie tried  to develop  his own  catchphrase  brother man  I want a  t-shirt  I was thinking  t-shirts  and bumper  stickers  maybe  coffee  my  knuckles  are getting  white  holding on  to the edge  of the console  just thinking  about this 
[00:56:30]  I can't  it's so  embarrassing  Iraq handed  it to me  yesterday  or two  days ago  and he  goes  this is  really  really  uncomfortable  I was  he said  you basically  said it was  uncomfortable  for you to  cut it up  the manufactured  energy  you guys  are going  to war  you had  to have  some kind  of energy  shut up  we describe  everything  theater of the  mind  man  painting a  picture  you guys  were acting  like you  were really  doing it  oh yeah  oh yes 
[00:57:00]  yes  like it was  as it was  happening  oh Jim  wait till  you hear  we're strafed  by helicopters  oh Jim  bad sound effects  I'm giving traffic  reports because  I'm high above  Boston  look at the  smile on  Jimmy's face  he loves  this stuff  and I  I say to  Bob Kelly  and Rich Voss  enjoy  this is a  very rare  rare opportunity  to get the  most of it  because this  ain't happening  anytime soon  after this  eating a  heaping  helping  of something 
[00:57:30]  that hangs  from the  lower half  this tape  was never  supposed to  see the  light of  day  this was  back in  the day  when no  one really  cared about  our show  so no  one was  taping it  it wasn't  like people  were trading  the tapes  and the bits  like they do  to this  day  this was  buried in  a box  a cassette  it was  barely  recognizable  it was in  a box  where a mouse  was living  because there  was mouse  droppings  in the box  and it  was making  a nest  listening  to it  that's  right  I found  this cassette  it was so  old and the  label was pretty  much peeled off 
[00:58:00]  the thing  I'm like I  don't even  think this  is going to  play anymore  and this  was I'm  convinced  this is the  only copy  of this  and now  it's seeing  the light  of day  and people  are now  going to  tape it  but here  we go  this is how  it all  started that  day  and I want  to make it  perfectly  clear  this is  1996  2006  yes  could we  really  like  emphasize  the fact  that  this is  12 years  ago  I had  been doing  radio  for  maybe  a couple  of months  you still  had your  tool belt  on 
[00:58:30]  yes  I did  I didn't  know if  it was  going to  work out  I don't  know how  it did  after listening  to this  and it's  labeled  war against  WABU  TV  day 3  day 3  we've  milked  this crap  for 3  days  day 3  alright  just hold  hold on  take a  grab  something  hold on  this is  really bad  ready  no  no I'm  not  this is  out  12 years  ago  good afternoon  it's  Opie and  Anthony  stop  hey

[01:00:30]  Steve from Bayshore  Opie's catchphrase  should have been  printed on toilet paper  alright here we go  we hate you  and I'm glad to  see you brought  in your fatigues  yes I am dressed  in full military  regalia today  we are in a war  and Anthony and I  both have our  fatigues on  and we're ready to go  there's a reason  for that too  well today is the  day of retaliation  yes  now they are  sitting over there  at their little  TV station  wondering what  Opie and Anthony  will do to retaliate

[01:23:30]  at each other  and maybe one  will catch one  just  wow  just  do you really think  you're the reason  do you think it was her  not wearing a bra  that got you  kicked off the air  you guys are the reason  that just crap radio  someone's home going  if they can do this  so can i  okay  1996  never realized  how  how just  hacky  zooey we sounded  why  with that  yeah 
[01:24:00]  yeah  everything had to have  a laugh behind it  and just  we found our voices up there  because we started getting  very angry  and we changed our whole delivery  thank god  who heard this  and thought  like  these guys  have to get it  to new york  question is  who didn't  ah  well here's  the last  minute  before we have to  let's just play it  oh no  Anthony  we are  in an unmarked 
[01:24:30]  here it is  the phone call  well I guess  we have officially  left the  broadcast center  where  where were we  we were just  in a production  well we were  early in the production  we never left  the radio station  oh no we did  I think we  calling  wow I don't remember  I remember for some  yeah no we were  we ended up in a  I think this is  us in a van  going to the IHOP  which was close 
[01:25:00]  to the TV station  just to check out  to see if they were  going to believe  what we were doing  oh is that it  I believe  so it's your  servicemen  do they feed you  free at the IHOP  I mean you come in  you're just  on your way to battle  do you think  a couple pancakes  for the boys  I mean some good  old guys like you  without a catchphrase  in full uniform  which in their case  was with a nozzle  hanging off their heads  are you ready  it's time to get  the  oh this is not good  when do you drop  the bras from Bobby 
[01:25:30]  see it doesn't even  work goofing on  anybody else  now  you guys are  free  you have a pass  yes we do  brother man  you all have a pass  so this is  brother  this is the official  deployment of  Operation Bra Bomb  I like you're in an  unmarked van too  we said that  oh yeah  unmarked  like there's no  marking  like what other  marks would there be  guys on way to  Bra Bomb  I remember when the  recruiters came to my  school to get me to  enlist into this war 
[01:26:00]  yeah it was for the  Civil War  okay that's funny  ready  and then they'll be  free and running  through the streets  and you joined up  didn't you  Sophie and Anthony  we are in an  unmarked van right  now bro  this is too much  I'm getting nervous  man  don't get nervous  we gotta do the  retaliation  retaliation against  WABU for screwing  us over with our  TV show man  tell everyone  where we're off to  bro  alright we're going  to a secret 
[01:26:30]  location which is  a parking lot  and we're actually  gonna get into  a hot air blimp  and  pause this  I see a little  flaw here  you sure you're not  going to a tie  dye festival  a little question  here the vans  are marked  undisclosed location  so you can get  into a blimp  I'm not even  thinking about the  logistics of this 
[01:27:00]  whole thing  that you're pointing  out  I'm just thinking  of the awfulness  of it  but you're pointing  out some very  valid things here  you know how hard  it is to hide a  blimp in Worcester  and then you hear  Opie stutter through  it but just end  with bro  to say  there's one thing  Opie did there  to which I love  it was to explain  why they were  doing it  like it was  kind of like  coming back  like you know  to avenge our TV  yes yeah  he had to  spoon feed the  audience  it's called  spoon feeding  let's say 
[01:27:30]  how to carrot  a jersey  carrot  let's go to  Staten Island  John  instead of an  unmarked van  you should have  had a van  with a giant  douche on the  side  oh my god  you know what  it is  you gotta go  unmarked  this way  the competition  doesn't know  you're coming  undisclosed  location  so the cops  won't be waiting  for you  of course  that's right  just back that  blimp into the  walmart  with all the 
[01:28:00]  other blimps  it's a dirigible  direct like it's  a VW van  hot air blimp  and we're  gonna fly  over  ABU  and bomb  them with  bras and  water balloons  well we're  calling them  the bra  bomb  basically  they're water  balloons with  bras attached  to them  now that  they're on  to this  we're probably  gonna have to  get through  their air  defenses  we'll be  checking in 
[01:28:30]  in a few  minutes here  in the meantime  we might as  well play the  latest from  van halen  we weren't  we weren't  even good  enough yet  to just do  our talk  show  we weren't  allowed  to just  talk  see it  when you  have to  pepper in  music  you're not  good enough  to do a  talk show  yet  this is  really early  on  you're going  to bomb  a TV  studio  which is  probably  illegal  but first  let's get  to OU812  and don't  forget the  Gallagher concert  12 years 
[01:29:00]  ago  12 years  ago  latest from  van halen  off the  greatest hit  CD that's  coming out  this song  features  David Lee  Rock  Anthony's  getting excited  give me your  beer man  we're cranking  up van halen  in the car  here  why couldn't  the blimp  have the same  fate as the  Hindenburg  a lot of 
[01:29:30]  comments  coming in  air defenses  against the  blimp  a bunch of  interns on  the roof  with fans  let's go to  Nigel in  Kentucky  Nigel  this is  terrible  yes  about the  aircraft you  were using  to bomb  their TV  station  it wasn't  the Enola  gay  it was  just  gay  let's  say hi  to  Brandon  Brandon  what's  up 
[01:30:00]  hey  boys  I  think  this  needs  to be  the next  coke  logic  animation  oh my god  it would make  a good one  I know what  part he could  use too  we got audio  from us in the  sky  which is  once we hit  the sky  and the  blimp  you won't  believe the  action  how did you  make the  wind effect  oh you  wait  so you hear  the sound  effect  well it's  we had a lot  to work with  in the production  room  well this is 
[01:30:30]  alright  we're getting  there  I think we  can squeeze  one more  minute in  and then  when we  get back  from break  it's us  actually in  the air  bombing  the  you don't  use a  stop right  there  TV station  bombing  let's go to  Caesar  in Staten  Island  Caesar  yeah  I'm just  wondering if  the title  of this  little war  episode  was called  We Were  Morons  oh no  there goes  another bit  that's starting 
[01:31:00]  a band  of brother  mans  well here  we go  Sophie and  Anthony  we are at  our destination  oh man  this thing  is unreal  look at this  thing  it's a blimp  but it's  tiny  I feel like  I'm there  don't you  I'm painting  a picture  this thing's  unreal  look at this  thing  it's a blimp  but it's  tiny  tiny  blimp  but tiny  black hawk 
[01:31:30]  down syndrome  people are  coming in  with movies  oh boy  a crock  of shit  now  saving private  douche  full metal  oh  we're gonna  need some  lope wisers  during the  break  oh  the only thing  that's gonna  save us  well  I can't  well  you're seeing  the blimp 
[01:32:00]  now  I gotta hear  more of this  it's like I'm in the car with you  sounds amazing  it's tiny  I'm not getting in this  it's crazy  it's got one of those propane things  to get us up in the air  and a couple engines  to get us moving forward  but hey  is that  they better have gas in it  I'm not gonna be drifting  all over Boston  did you hear that guy  just beep at us  that was pretty funny  actually  okay we are about ready  to start our retaliations  against WABU  we're climbing into the craft  dude hold the phone for a second  I gotta get this  box of bra bombs 
[01:32:30]  into the craft  load it up  this is the dumbest thing  I've ever been part of  man  I'm actually a little scared  and we look stupid  if we die  I'm in a stupid  flight suit  like Tom Cruise  war in Top Gun  I'm gonna look like an idiot  oh boy  no after Top Gun  Tom Cruise  could hold his head up high  I'm not gonna look like an idiot  you really got boozed  on that last line  I really did  I lost myself  I'm not gonna do this  I'm not gonna die  with this suit on 
[01:33:00]  shut up  I like the fact  that as you're broadcasting  you're like  you're like  here hold this  I have to load these bras  and why not just do it  on the slot  why not have guys with you  or preload it  please don't be illogical  you ask  we gotta explain it  like it's a movie  or something  where's the guy  that actually filled  the balloon up for you  there was just a balloon  waiting for you in a field  and there's also  these awful  you know how bad  it is to do  like these remotes  you guys had perfect quality  while you were moving around  yes we did  here hold this  it sounds just like it did  10 seconds ago 
[01:33:30]  in the band  while I'm outside  even in the blimp  it sounds amazing  I don't  never cuts out  I don't remember this  I would try to  do it  I would try to  blank it out too  I was thinking that yesterday  I don't remember doing this  I don't remember like  recording it  I have no idea  what's gonna happen next  like I feel like  I'm hearing this  for the first time  it's so weird  it's like when you get  molested  you just  buried it  let's go to Steve  you're on the  Opie and Anthony show  Steve  yeah that sounds like  mission unlistenable 
[01:34:00]  oh wow  oh wow  gone  I'm gonna look like an idiot  well Anthony  explain the craft again  it's a Jensen AS111  it's uh  like you said  it's controlled by propane  but it's got two  Briggs & Stratton  10 horse engines  so we could  putt around the skies in it  the guy Al  gave me this uh  a crash course  and I hate using the word crash  but a crash course 
[01:34:30]  I mean  you get what  my drift  little verbal slip  whoa  I hate using the word crash  but a crash course  on how to fly  and you're gonna be  the navigator  and bombardier  this is gonna be fun  actually  I'm scared  if you're getting in your car  to drive home  I would look up in the sky  because we should be  getting at  we should be getting  over WABU  within 20-25 minutes  from right now  and we will drop  these bra bombs  on top of WABU 
[01:35:00]  like it or not  go for the transmitter  go for the transmitter  wow  like it or not  that's tough talk  I'm surprised you weren't  dropping job applications  this is Greg John  from Virginia  General Hack Arthur  wait there was one light  oh yeah  full metal jack offs  oh boy 
[01:35:30]  transmitter  go for the transmitter  and they can't stop us  they want to censor us  well they're gonna have to  deal with a little retaliation  alright  alright bro  we should rock on  with some tunes  we're jumping in the crap  and Godspeed  next time you talk to us  we will be  in the air  hopefully he'll be  off the air  oh shit  okay terrific  that's terrible 
[01:36:00]  I'm sorry  you need to play  all those together  well  unfortunately  we gotta do  other things today  so we  what  wait what  try to find  your dignity  I wanna listen  from 1996  12 years ago  yeah dude  yeah yeah  brother bro  brother man  don't be a mother hugger  hey fella guy  fella guy 
[01:36:30]  when we get back  hey dude sister  we got  O&A  airborne  it's uncomfortable  it's uncomfortable  for anyone  to listen to this  it's what  E-Rock wrote  and what was the rest  of this  what  what was the rest  of it  not uncomfortable  it's been  no  the next clip  is the reason  you're listening  today  it is  Anthony will  walk out of the studio  I don't know why  he will hide  he will  have to leave  dude the bottom line  is this  we all get pushed  around in life  you guys 
[01:37:00]  weren't gonna take it  if I had access  to a little blimp  Jensen wasn't  I'm so glad  it only takes  one sense  to listen to you guys  if I had to taste this  I smell it  I would throw up  right now  imagine if we  really did this  there would be  just a janitor  on the roof  just annoyed  just sweeping up bras  like what  what did this do  yeah  gave me something 
[01:37:30]  to do for an hour  oh we're the worst  well let's say  hi to Eric  in New Jersey  Eric  hey what is this  Pearl Horrible  let's go to Chris  in Houston  Chris  what's up boy  hey  apocalypse  alright we're gonna 
[01:38:00]  take it right  while we get back  we will be  in the air  as we look back  to a show we did  12 years ago  Bora Bora Bora  oh is that a good one  oh Jesus Christ  who wrote that one  viral load  and someone's requesting  collective soul  thanks John  John B  from Omaha  hey it's 
[01:38:30]  Opie and Anthony  F you  you rock  it's Opie and Anthony  oh god  I gotta strap in again  here's your collective soul  we have a few gems  from some of the audience  yeah we're  in the middle  of listening to a show  we did 12 years ago  for the people that  unfortunately just tuned in  you missed a lot  but  months after our  our debut  in Boston radio  yeah  it's funny  instead of platoon 
[01:39:00]  how about buffoon  and this guy  you should call it  bridge over river queer  ram bro  that was another one  I got  Chris from Pennsylvania  boar of the world  my favorite here  is from Spike W  New Hampshire  full metal  hack bit  the longest show  the yawn patrol  how about Butch and Jersey  Butch 
[01:39:30]  an O&A double feature  board on the 4th of July  followed by  bridge over the river  why  bridge over the river  why  Kelly's zeros  an officer  and a brother man  casualties of boar  operation shock  and awful 
[01:40:00]  Tony J  from Connecticut  well James G  dump out if you have to  North Carolina  this sounds like  fags of our fathers  very good  so  you want to  you want to  set the stage here  Jimmy  yeah  it's  there was apparently  a TV show  up in 96  it was  critically acclaimed  it was  big fan following  and they censured it 
[01:40:30]  I found the tapes  I'll bring the first  episode in tomorrow  and we'll put it up  on the fine website  that is named after  the show  that we cannot  promote  and it was  W  what was it  ABU  or ABU  right  they took the show  off the air  and they were about  to rule  that decision  Opie and Anthony  got a  a blimp  and we're going  to drop  paint filled  bra bombs  on the station  bra bombs 
[01:41:00]  bra bombs  yeah that's  what we were  armed with  well because we  were collecting  bras  I remember  this part  we were collecting  bras for a while  sure  and we were  going to like  hang the bras  in protest  across the  Charles River  but the station  thought that would  not be a good idea  we would get in  real trouble  so then we had to  go into  into the land  of  we had to go  into the land  of  fantasy  I can't 
[01:41:30]  the whole thing  is just  and I just found  this out  yeah  because you hear  they're like  broadcasting  from the van  and then  Opie's loading  things into  the blimp  and Ant's  got like  they get  the military  clothes  and all of a  sudden  we're on  break  and they're  like  you know  we were in  studio the whole  time  get out of here  you were not  in studio  the whole time  yeah  hard to believe  this is really  uncomfortable  strap in  I don't think  I could  don't forget  they were in  full  full  regalia  absolutely  military 
[01:42:00]  hot air balloon  as we pick up  the show  from 12 years  ago  12 years  ago  1996  which isn't  that long  ago  we are  in the air  I think  we're on  the air  bro  it's Opie  and Anthony  we are heading  for our  aerial assault  we're about  600 feet  off the ground  over the  Charles River  heading out  of Boston  heading toward  our target  don't look at  me like that  Jimmy  people are  looking up  and waving  at us  man  this thing  is unreal  we're in  a hot air  they're waving  goodbye 
[01:42:30]  off the  Boston airwaves  I don't think  it goes to  waving with  one finger  oh and those  things that  were waving  they were the  ratings  I hate  the look  Jimmy's  giving me  it's this  awful  like  pitied  look  blimp  sounds  wait till 
[01:43:00]  you hear  the helicopters  Jimmy  I love  how their  voice is  getting louder  because they  have to talk  over the  engines  of course  it's crazy  yeah  yeah  yeah  and on  the phone  yes  hey  we lost  you  oh come  on man  we're in  all right  well Jeff  Jersey  what's up  what's up  brother  Chester's liver  I'm sorry  from here  to obscurity  what do you  got Jeff  the next video  to go viral

[01:45:00]  this is so  hard to listen  to  I'm cursing  I'm sorry  what's happening  well we don't  know what just  happened  it must have  been a good  idea  ready  yeah what was  that  what the heck  is that  oh my god  what was that  are you alright  bro  yeah  that was a  traffic copter  I guess they're  doing the traffic  report  wait can I ask  a question  you start off  by going  what the heck  is that  and then all of a 
[01:45:30]  sudden you guys  get like  whoa what is  that  like how did  you not  recognize a  helicopter  that was  dropping panties  I don't  understand how  a helicopter  a traffic copter  came by  yeah  and you like  you saw it  and then it  moved  and then all of a  sudden you didn't  recognize it  how did you not  recognize it was a  helicopter  I should have  Jimmy  I really should  have recognized  that  this was a  propane  propeller  Jensen  a helicopter 
[01:46:00]  Briggs and  Stratton engine  and  well  wow  I  what is that  obscure thing  that flew by us  I've never seen  one of these  before  after I guess  they're doing  the traffic  report  wait can we  hear the  I gotta hear  the bump  again  can we  please hear  that  I let you  go what  the heck  is that  and then  boom  you know  what the heck  is that  oh my god  what was that  are you alright  bro  yeah  that was a  traffic copter  I guess  they're doing  the traffic  report 
[01:46:30]  is that  what you  guess  they're  doing  hold on  not only  here he goes  we're gonna  get through  this  this is a  four minute  clip  we've done  20 seconds  not only did  Anthony not  recognize a  helicopter  he almost  got hurt  thank god  you're okay  but  Ope  not only knew  exactly what  it was  he knew  what they  were there  for  it's a  traffic copter  the news is  five  and  I don't 
[01:47:00]  understand  how you  do exactly  what the  helicopter  it was  Steve Pike  from Boston  red yawn  casualties of  this bit  we are very  close to the  mass pike  we have  actually just  passed over  the BU  bridge and  I can see  the mass  pike and  actually  traffic is  really really  bad today  it looks like  all the cars  are stopping  and looking up  in the air  now you're  doing the  traffic report  on the way  to an attack 
[01:47:30]  a big mission  you decide to  do traffic  and also  the people  are waving  at them  and they can  see traffic  is stopped  and yet  the helicopter  five feet  away from  the blimp  nobody seems  to know  nothing  what is that  mysterious  whirly bird  is that a  pterodactyl  no Anthony  it's a  helicopter  doing a  traffic report  sponsored by  why are you  doing this  to me  but what  happened to  traffic was  stopped  everybody's  looking up  they're probably  like is this  crap actually  coming through  my radio  antenna  but they 
[01:48:00]  were in  full regalia  so the  helicopter  couldn't see  them  Opie your  catchphrase  should be  sorry  it's like  hat break  rich  you got me  laughing so  hard I just  drooled on  myself  and looking up  in the air  for some reason  man  yo dude  give us another  blast  the red baron  is strafing us  apparently  hold on 
[01:48:30]  that's tough  war talk  that's very  genuine  very authentic  war talk  dude  back off  that's what  Clint Eastwood  said in all  his movies  could you not  listen to this  I like the fact  that as it's  coming we hear  the helicopter  and then they  go whoa  were you scared  the traffic copter  was going to  shoot you guys  down  is that what  you're worried  about  yeah I thought  there might be  an accident

[02:08:30]  to see you  and yet you can see  the middle finger  from the clouds  notice that they have  binoculars  you know what  you know what makes  this bit  you know easier  Anthony  you gotta make fun of  yourself from 12 years ago  I can't even listen  that Opie from 12 years ago  what a douche  nah he's outie now  oh boy  he's outie  that Opie  he's whoa  whoa watch out  don't know what  he's gonna do next  I love the fact  that the bit  like you're painting  him as the business  man like the old  like the typical  yeah 
[02:09:00]  like I can't believe  those business men  in suits  why you  those fuddy duddies  that was the enemy man  socials  corporate  socials  right  killers  looking up at us  well don't forget  the guys  with the walkie talkies  and we were literally  it looked like  close enough  where they could  reach up and get us  but they couldn't  and it pissed them off  that's why they needed  binoculars to see you  they could have  almost reached up  and grabbed you  so they wanted to  look into your  nostril hair  the inconsistencies here  are just stunning 
[02:09:30]  I have to say it again  I gotta take it  inside this whole thing  I do not remember  doing this  I swear to you  I forgot all about this  until I found this  this tape  I don't remember this  I don't remember  being in a studio  and recording this  I don't remember  you're lucky  you're lucky  I remember  I remember  our first April Fool's  I remember our first  April Fool's prank  where we actually got  hundreds of people  to show up at a  a club that didn't exist  to see Pearl Jam  I remember doing that one  and that one 
[02:10:00]  got us in a lot of trouble  and it was way more  believable than this crap  I  alright  it pissed him off  there was another guy  with binoculars  we're like  dude we're right above you  you idiot  the guy's looking  like a mile away  no we're like  400 feet above you man  400 feet  at one point  I got scared man  I'm pulling on the propane  trying to get us back up  and we were getting  closer and closer  to the building  and that's when you  unloaded the D cup  right  yeah if you're just  tuning in  we just bombed  W-A-B-U  we had a little  airstrike from above 
[02:10:30]  we had this like  blimp  flat  I don't know  hot air balloon  I guess you would call it  and we had these  bra bombs  we're calling them  they were water balloons  attached with bras  and we just bombed  everyone down there  at W-A-B-U  we bombed the cars  the people  we bombed that one  postman  I apologize  if you're listening man  we did not mean  to hit you  I swear to you  why would he be listening  you hit him  in his mail truck  we hit a milkman  covered wagon  mission accomplished 
[02:11:00]  yeah that we survived  I hope  I hope they have  tape of that  back at the station  because we're going  to have to listen  to that to see  how it sounded  because I have no clue  man  when you play  it was until  12 years later  yeah  oh  and wish  alright listen  I have to say  one thing  sorry  accepted  one thing  how the fuck  easy there chief

[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Mike Voss coming into town today, Eric Logan.  Is he?  Yeah, there's some meetings going on today.  We'll see what happens.  See what happens.  He'll be faced out on a bar by noon.  Who's getting fired?  No, I mean, we're real good.  I mean, who's getting fired for not having my station properly set up?  What's wrong with your station?  What's missing from me? 
[02:19:00]  My mouth on your cock.  Oh, right.  Your dignity from the last bit.  Oh, right.  Your blimp license.  It was my headphones.  Your blimp license.  A broth full of water balloons.  Oh, E-Rock took a look.  Oh, your headphones.  Yes, my headphones.  Wow, what the hell is that?  Oh, it's only Nathaniel.  Oh, very, very excited we were about the whole thing.  You know, during the walkover, I reflect a lot and think and stuff. 
[02:19:30]  And I was thinking about what we did over at FM.  Sorry, Blue Healer.  He goes, oh, please, for the love of God, don't talk about the FM show on XM.  But it's kind of important today.  Shut your mouth.  I was trying to wrap my arms around that show we just played for everybody.  And I came to the conclusion at the XM door that I need to go home and kill myself.  Because I can't comprehend thinking that was good radio on any level. 
[02:20:00]  I don't care.  12 years ago.  Well, 12 years ago, that was good radio.  Was it?  Like, there's not a hint of sarcasm.  There's not a hint of us goofing on bad radio shows.  Yeah.  And I don't.  Like, we would goof on that.  If somebody handed us that now and said, there's a show and here's a little example of what they're doing.  We would play it and just tear it to shreds.  Because there isn't a hint of sarcasm. 
[02:20:30]  Like, if you listened and said, oh, but you could tell they're goofing on themselves.  That's one thing.  But we were absolutely serious that this was good.  And it sounded like we were doing that.  I would love to talk to myself from 12 years ago and go, what were you guys thinking?  How did this idea come about?  Like, I don't remember doing that.  I felt like I woke up from a coma today.  I was like everyone else.  What is going to be said next?  Yeah, I had no idea.  No clue.  No clue.  But the thing is, like, it's like, as comics even, you look back on what you did when you 
[02:21:00]  started or X amount of years ago.  And it's like, how did I ever think that was not the shit that I now know it was?  And I go through with not only my own material, but my old character choice, my stage personnel.  It's almost like I was talking as we stood at the bathroom door.  But it's, uh...  Well, after we jerked each other off, you know, of course, we've got to have a little  small talk.  We always talk after so we don't feel like faggots.  You know, a couple of men, we just kind of wipe our cum hands on our pants without making 
[02:21:30]  eye contact.  We discuss the show.  Well, actually, we talk to each other after because we're truly deeply in love with each  other.  Yeah.  But when he's not looking, I lick my cum hand.  Shh.  Keep it under your hat, boys.  Or your pith helmet, as it were.  But, uh, you can't, when you look back on the early days, you can't judge yourself on  the journey, as corny as it is.  It's like, we're all trying to find who we are as performers.  And we were all basically douchebags. 
[02:22:00]  I mean, when you look at, like, even what Carlin did before what he did, I mean, it was  obviously nothing that awful, but it was wearing a suit and being part of a comedy deal.  It's like, he wasn't Carlin.  Yeah.  It's almost like, yeah, but with that said, I told Jimmy, I go, Jimmy, I remember the  feedback, uh, vaguely.  Like I said, really vaguely.  I remember this much.  People weren't looking at us like, wow, that, that was an awful show today.  Yeah.  People weren't going, God, you guys suck.  The buzz in the market wasn't, these guys are doing hacky radio. 
[02:22:30]  I vaguely remember that we, we got positive feedback for that, which I completely don't  understand as I sit here in the year 2008.  I don't understand it.  But it's the same thing.  Cause I'm unloading a lot of boxes lately and I'm going through old pictures and stuff.  I look horrendous in a lot of these old photographs with dumb hairstyles, dumb.  Wait till you see my Sam Kinison picture that I'm going to put online.  I've seen that.  Yeah.  You've seen it.  Yeah.  It's a sweater that was, uh, was popular at the time. 
[02:23:00]  It was the acid wash black jeans, not even, you know, blue jeans.  I look like a complete tool, but when I wore this back, uh, now this would be late eighties.  Early nineties.  When I wore this back in the day, I thought I looked good when I went to work that day.  People around me thought you look good.  That's what people are wearing.  They weren't shocked that I came to work like this.  Dude, I had parachute pants.  That's what I'm saying.  So when you look back, you can't comprehend why this was ever cool or, or in style like 
[02:23:30]  that fucking show we just did.  But then that clothing style will come back.  It's weird.  Like all of a sudden it becomes retro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, mullets.  I mean, people want fucking mullets, the gay porno mustache in the seventies.  I mean, anything with perspective, the perspective of time you look back on, especially when it's  creative, you're like, Oh God, am I a douche?  How did I ever think that was quality?  Yeah.  But they should have quit after that.  I'm not even disagreeing.  You know what I'm thinking too, that, that audience over there was really young, right? 
[02:24:00]  That was a really fucking, we can be a lot of teens and stuff.  Oh my God.  How many underage girls did we see naked in our time in Boston?  Oh my God.  Jesus Christ.  What?  What?  Please.  It's like you mix chitty, chitty, bang, bang with radio.  That was good.  Chitty, chitty, bang, bang.  Yes.  And it was shitty, shitty, bang, bang.  It's funny, Opie doesn't remember the bit, but he remembers the feedback.  Yeah, wait a minute. 
[02:24:30]  No, what I mean by that, I wouldn't remember like negative feedback.  That one I would definitely remember because we all remember the negative shit that happens  to us in our lives.  It's just human nature.  You know, I forgot who said it.  They said it perfectly.  You could get a hundred emails saying how great you are and the show's great.  Somebody was saying this about what they were doing and they go, but one fucker will  email me and I'll be obsessed with that one dumb email when in reality is it's one dope  among a lot of people that like what you do.  He just made that one dope smile right now. 
[02:25:00]  He's going to be getting an email.  I hate that one asshole.  I'm sure we left the studio that day going, dude, it's out of the park.  Absolutely.  Great show.  Absolutely.  Did you leave in your balloon?  No, we left the balloon in the parking lot.  I guess the regular guys are trashing us this morning.  Who is?  One market sensation.  They got back together.  They're back on the air?  In Atlanta.  The regular guy?  They're trashing us saying we're not funny or something?  No, they weren't.  Oh, did they hear the bit before and think that was new? 
[02:25:30]  Because those guys, I've done radio with those guys when I was down there.  They were fucking very cool.  Fuck them in their fuckholes, I say.  They were nice when I do this.  That would look good on a t-shirt.  When you said, yeah, I had a lot of hooks in the water.  That was funny.  That's great.  Well, it's true though.  I was really hoping I would get a catchphrase going.  Yeah, let's find out about that regular guys thing, but I hope that's not true because  I like those guys.  I hope they're not really trashing the show, for real.  Yeah, I don't know.  We got the same agent.  Chill the fuck out, assholes. 
[02:26:00]  But they might not be.  People just talk shit.  They misinterpret one sarcastic remark and, you know.  We'll see.  Yeah, if you heard me, Vos, and Norton on another radio show today, you'd think we'd be trashing  you with all the stuff we were saying.  Well, that's true.  We got serious for a second there, but we have one more clip.  What?  One more clip.  Why?  What is it?  Because we recap what happened with Rocco.  Oh, Rocco! 
[02:26:30]  And people love the Rocco.  Oh, no.  The Rocco impression.  Rocco used to come on after us, so I guess we had done all these shenanigans with the  hot air balloons.  It was the last one.  And then we did the crossover break.  Sure.  You know, we're leaving.  The other jock's coming in to do his shift.  It's Rocco.  So we kind of talk a little bit.  And then we leave, and he does his show.  So I guess we, what?  We discussed our big bombing raid with Rocco.  Yeah.  And Rocco is just a big fat guy who used to do radio. 
[02:27:00]  I think just to get restaurants and hotels to bring him food.  He used to get on the air.  Hey, where's the buffet coming from today?  What was the name of his intern?  Hey, cowhead.  No, was it cowhead?  It was a cowhead on his show.  Wasn't that a man cow guy?  I don't know, but there was one on his show.  It was a rock hole version of him and then another guy.  Their job was just to run to like the Marriott, any other place. 
[02:27:30]  Across the street, yep.  All right, well, here's the last clip.  Oh, thank God.  Sophie, it's Anthony.  It's Rocco.  Rocco.  We got Ticket Blitz Thursday happening.  I think we have another pair of tickets to give away to see Gallagher.  Successful mission today on the radio.  Oh, wait, wait.  I got to turn you up, Rocco.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  See, we sound kind of all right there.  We're not.  Our voices aren't getting high and overexcited.  We're just.  That's fine.  I can handle that from 12 years ago. 
[02:28:00]  You're not trying to do humor.  You did say radio.  And Anthony did say something about Rocco.  Yeah, Rocco.  Yeah.  I still can't hear you.  What is wrong with that?  Is your mic on?  Something's never changed.  No, it's not on.  What's that black stuff on your face?  Did you guys wash it off yet?  Like that camouflage stuff?  No, of course not.  It was shit from the face.  I think Rocco is making fun of us. 
[02:28:30]  That's pretty funny just hearing his voice.  Hey, what's that?  Hey, what's that?  Black stuff on your face.  Shut up.  You got that on your face.  I got a girl's cup.  Yeah.  I begged a 15-year-old in the conference room  just before I came on the air.  Keep it under your hat,  even though I'm showing everyone the videotape.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Hey, who knows?  Maybe I gave her Coke, too.  We don't know. 
[02:29:00]  Literally.  Hey, who knows what was going on there?  I didn't see it.  We really don't know.  Have you had that camouflage stuff?  No, of course not.  It's ridiculous that we even had that camouflage on.  It's off in the air.  What the hell are they going to say?  Check out my fatigues, though.  I'm still playing.  You guys look like you're in the Marines.  Well, we're at war with this stupid TV station.  You got dressed apart, man.  You didn't have to dress in fatigues, though.  Show me your boots to get open.  Yeah.  He's got the Army boots with the pants bloused out around the tops.  He's making an inspection.  You're no prize either, dude.  Look at you.  I'm the slovenly soldier. 
[02:29:30]  My shirt's untucked.  Like a mess.  You still got that black stuff all in your ear.  I know.  Oh, I do.  Hey, Rocco.  I tried to wash.  I'm going to give you a treat tonight.  What?  Uh-oh.  We got the actual audio of me and Anthony bombing a...  Oh, my God.  I wanted him to replay it?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Well, he's like an open mic.  You're giving out his tape.  Oh, my God.  It was the actual audio.  Like, it was actually famous.  And can I say...  It was so good.  It was so good. 
[02:30:00]  And can we have the actual audio?  Can I say that you appropriately referred to it as a treat?  No.  Boss's mic is not on, by the way.  Am I sure?  Does your mic understand something?  It doesn't matter.  I'm sorry.  Who could ever tell?  Wow.  Let's talk.  Talk about what...  It is.  It is.  It's like, hey, Rocco, at your leisure, you just play this.  And the listeners will come fucking pouring in.  Can I please hear the treat line again?  We got a real treat for you.  You're going to have our slot.  This is impossible. 
[02:30:30]  We don't have the audio that somebody else actually did over.  We have the actual audio.  Yeah.  I mean, you get the uncut stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That shirt's untucked.  Like a mess.  You got that black stuff all in your ear.  I know.  Oh, I do.  Hey, Rocco.  I tried to wash.  I'm going to give you a treat tonight.  That was a great line right there by hand.  I got to make fun of him because of something Jimmy said.  How you don't know and know at the same time.  He goes, I know.  Do I?  Did anyone else pick up my mess?  Yeah, he was trying to like not be negative in the improv. 
[02:31:00]  He's trying to be yes.  Listen, listen.  He knows and doesn't know at the same time.  The only reason I pointed out because Jimmy pointed this out like an hour ago.  Like a mess.  You got that black stuff all in your ear.  I know.  Oh, I do.  Hey, Rocco.  I know.  Oh, I do.  Wow.  Do I?  I'm positive of it.  Fucking Gary Gearshift.  Maybe.  I'm definitely positive.  Maybe.  What?  No.  The wash.  I'm going to give you a treat tonight.  What?  Uh-oh. 
[02:31:30]  We got the actual audio of me and Anthony bombing ABU.  I almost drove off the road when I heard it.  I'm going to give this to you to play, all right?  Later on.  Is that cool?  That's fine.  I'll play it.  How do you guys talk to each other right now without laughing?  You guys look like you're going to, you guys look like you're going to the woods.  Dude, because we take our, this whole thing pretty seriously.  Let me tell you.  They got the fatigues on.  Right.  Opie's got a canteen sitting behind him.  Where do you think you're going?  Well, know what that's filled with, don't you?  I didn't see.  It's cranked too old, baby. 
[02:32:00]  And they got the green and the.  I just am.  Holy shit.  I think Voss's cyst just got bigger.  It's theater.  No, no, no, it's not.  See, I wasn't even, I wasn't even cool enough to go with the fact that there might be alcohol  in my canteen.  It had to be cranked too old.  What is cranked too old?  Oh, it's, it's out of control water, Jimmy.  It was some kind of. 
[02:32:30]  It was caffeinated water.  That's not liquor?  No.  No.  You guys like water back then.  Ew.  You had water balloons, cranked too old.  It was.  But you gave me a case of beer.  Yeah.  If I hit the.  Yeah.  Water down bit.  A bottle of cranked too old, if I remember correctly, it was like having six cups of coffee.  There was a lot of caffeine in it, and then we would take that cranked too old and then  make regular coffee with the water.  We were just crazy.  Let me tell you guys.  Well, there you go.  That's why you're so crazy on the air with these bits.  Yeah, all that coffee.  Yeah.  What's, what do you got in the thing?  Six bowls of total.  You know, that equals. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, no.  Cranked too old, baby.  And they got the green and black, like, war paint on their face.  It's like really stupid, man.  But it's good.  Well, we thought we didn't want to be identified.  I meant that nice.  Well, we thought, we don't even know who filmed this.  We want to look good for the TV cameras and the press and stuff, dude.  I didn't want to be identified.  We didn't want to be identified.  It was successful.  But we broadcasted.  You were in a blimp on the radio.  Way to slip under the radar. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, is that horrid.  Is there more?  That is it.  Swear.  That's it.  Oh, wow.  We have another one cut up, but I don't think we can handle it today.  No, not today, but that's Sperm Bowl.  Sperm Bowl 96, everybody, because we thought this was going to be an annual event.  I don't know.  Yeah, I do.  Look, it's Sperm Bowl 96, because, you know, there's going to be some crazy things that happen  that we're going to have to top when we do Sperm Bowl 97. 
[02:34:00]  You were going to have Roman numerals.  Just X.  Yeah.  Sperm Bowl X.  No, we should do.  We've kind of joked.  I know we should do with that tape.  I know.  We've hinted at this for a while.  This is what we should do, just to make it a little different, because, you know, it's  the same old gag, just making fun of old audio.  We should play Sperm Bowl 96 and then redo the show.  It would sound a lot different today.  Hope so.  Basically, it's a show where Ant and I actually fucking jerked off. 
[02:34:30]  Jesus Christ.  And then had him walk down the hall with, like, a cup full of cum.  I'd love to redo that.  We should all do that in the fucking...  And we had a guy from a fertility clinic, the real deal, in a lab coat and everything,  with a microscope, and he...  Basically, the bit was to see who was more of a man by their sperm count.  Who won?  Yeah.  I can't give that away, Jimmy.  That's the big reveal.  Are you crazy?  That's Rocco.  Rocco.  Dude.  The big reveal.  That'll take weeks to finally get that answer. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, God.  Rocco came in and played a lot of long, though.  It was like it was...  It was almost like you felt like you were there, you know?  It's like, ah, these guys really are dressed up like this, apparently.  Yeah, Rocco...  Just in case you thought they were making it up, look, I'm the eyewitness here, and I'm  seeing what I'm seeing.  You got some black stuff in your ear.  Yeah, I do.  Do I?  When you left the studio, he kept saying to himself, I'm doing fucking midday?  No, I'm doing fucking midday, and these jambokes are in a fake balloon. 
[02:35:30]  He was doing...  He was doing nights.  Nights.  Oh, night.  Day or afternoon.  Yeah.  Well, you know the point.  Yeah, that wasn't even like middle of the night crap.  That was like primetime radio for 96.  Well, you know, I mean...  Why wouldn't you wipe the camouflage off?  Um, I did.  Did I?  I'm not sure.  God, that is so painful, man.  Why?  Because it's just...  Like Ope said, I thought at the time it was a lot better than it was. 
[02:36:00]  And then you look back after so long, and you realize, wow, that was shit.  May I ask if you thought it was, and I quote, a treat?  I think...  I did think it was a treat.  All right, let's...  Treat for Rocco.  I definitely thought it was a treat.  I don't know, was it?  I can't tell.  I don't remember.  Is that on your demo reel now?  That would be fun if you sent that out, like, said you guys were looking for work.  Oh, we'd probably get jobs fucking radio? 
[02:36:30]  Please.  Let me, uh...  It's safe.  It's good.  It's theater of the mind.  They would love it, people.  For the X-Emmers, a preview.  107.3 WAF with STP!  Oh, God.  That made me shiver.  This is the preview for the X-Emmers.  The only station that really rocks Stone Temple Pilots and Lady Picture Show.  Don't forget there, Fleet Center Show.  Coming to town.  Good afternoon, it's Opie, and it's Anthony on F-U Friday! 
[02:37:00]  Yeah!  Oh, boy.  Actually, today is going to be called F-U...  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I couldn't sound more fucking thrilled.  Yeah!  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You sound like you're just drunk, and I'm waking you up like, yeah!  Probably was.  Oh, boy.  A bottle next to you.  Probably was.  Head down on the counter.  Please, Opie, just let me finish this so I can forget about my marriage.  Actually, today is going to be called F-Yourself Friday. 
[02:37:30]  As you know by now, today is the day that we settle the score to find out who has the higher  sperm count.  Sperm Ball 96!  You know, you never think the day is actually coming until, well, here it is.  The day has arrived.  And now we have to go through with this.  And we will go through with this.  I hope our faithful listeners appreciate us because I am getting the stupidest looks in  public.  And, uh, well, last night we went out to dinner.  Yeah, we all went out to dinner last night to Fridays on Route 9. 
[02:38:00]  And, uh, the whole bar.  Jesus.  Wow.  You were making money back then, huh?  Big spenders.  Woo!  What happened?  I think it was sold out.  Fridays on Route 9.  Holy fuck!  We shared some spinach and avocado dip, and now we're going to jerk off and test it.  Oh, we all went out to dinner.  Yeah, yeah, we took the ladies out.  Yeah, to the Fridays on Route 9.  We got some steak tips, and the dessert came free.  Yeah, it was great.  We had to valet our blimp. 
[02:38:30]  Holy shit.  Fridays.  Fucking white trash.  Wow, Route 9's Friday is supposed to be one of the nicer ones in the area.  It is one of the finer of the Friday establishment.  Well, there's a lot of restaurants you could choose from in that area.  Yeah.  We wanted the best.  Sure.  We were the best radio guys in all of Boston.  Delicious, salty fries.  Who doesn't love them?  Fuck little hands in the mouth.  Apples.  We went out to dinner.  Yeah, we all went out to dinner last night to Fridays on Route 9, and the whole bar was 
[02:39:00]  looking at me and Ant.  Of course.  And usually, like, when people see us out, they're cool.  They, like, you know, give us a thumbs up or send over a round of beers or come over  and talk and stuff.  Yeah.  I really thought we were fucking the coolest dudes in Boston.  You were.  Like, they just couldn't wait to see us.  Hey, look, they're coming over and drinking with us.  Thumbs up in you.  If one person came over and said, uh, are you guys on the radio? 
[02:39:30]  Thumbs up, because that's what you do.  Like, oh, that's OP.  It's not that hard.  Thumbs up, dude.  It's not that hard to be the coolest guy on friggin' Fridays.  On Route 9.  Yeah.  You sure they didn't just...  Framingham.  They didn't make their fingers into a circle and give you the okey-doke?  Okey-dokey.  Are they?  It's a thumbs up or send over a round of beers or come over and talk and stuff.  Yeah.  Last night, there were giggles happening all over Fridays.  Sitting there, we had, you know, a couple of the girls with us and stuff. 
[02:40:00]  And people looking over and going, hey, good luck tomorrow, man.  I'm not going to shake your hand, though.  I don't know if you've been practicing or not.  Oh, boy.  Here it goes.  All the jokes.  I'm trying not to go out much.  I'm just staying home.  All right.  Can I tell you how you knew that they weren't?  I'm getting tired now.  Why?  Because you said there were giggles all around.  So I could say it's safe to say that they had not been listening to the blimp. 
[02:40:30]  Look at Jimmy.  He's all proud.  I know.  I love it.  I love it when Jimmy listens to this shit.  I get a rod right now.  Can I tell you something in this audio?  Yeah.  He's got a fucking fat arm.  He does love this.  You know what Nick Carter said on the way out?  He does middays here in New York after us.  He goes, way to fuck up the mystique that you guys have built up for the last 10 or 12  years by playing this shit.  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  You're right.  We should never play this stuff.  It's stupid. 
[02:41:00]  We had this legendary early year status where people actually thought we were doing some  type of very cutting edge.  This is way better that you're actually revealing this.  I agree.  It's like Miss America and there's just naked photos that are taken in the ass somewhere.  Yeah.  And they come out and ruin her career.  That's what I feel like.  No, but you realize she has a rash by her pussy.  It's almost like she's still pretty, but then when you see her panties come off, you're like,  ugh.  A rash by her pussy.  A big port wine stain that goes from her asshole to her fucking the back of her neck. 
[02:41:30]  Rich, you're really sullen.  What's the matter?  Rich, you all right?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm perfect.  Is it your cyst?  No, no.  I'm just relaxing.  I mean, you know, I don't want to step on any lines.  What's wrong, Rich?  What's wrong, dude?  I'm exhausted.  I'm Friday night.  I couldn't sleep.  Why?  You want to go to Fridays?  Huh?  You want to go to Fridays?  He was short as asshole.  Your asshole looks like an old guy who had, like, his eye taken out and is just a socket. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Just a little more, and then we're going to save this for another day.  Okay, please reflect.  I missed the last couple lines.  We're running out of energy here.  Well, we're going to be filming this whole thing for the TV show.  This is going to be so brutal.  And we got a couple bets going.  We got a side bet for a case of beer.  Yes.  That will be paid off tonight.  The case of beer goes to the guy that actually finishes the deed the quickest.  Now, this is going to be impossible because, I mean, this is high stress. 
[02:42:30]  I don't even know how the hell I'm going to do this.  All I'm going to say is, what's with my voice?  I can hear your smile.  Yeah.  You're just excited.  It's good that I don't fucking smile anymore.  It's really nice.  Why?  I was kind of going to, hey, yeah.  It's really hard.  Let me tell you.  It's really going to be hard to do.  Just smiling, talking to you.  This is going to be really hard to do.  Oh, fucking hang yourself. 
[02:43:00]  And punt.  You know how the hell I'm going to do this.  All I'm going to say is, I've got a secret weapon.  And I hope you have planned some things.  You have a secret weapon.  That's all I'm going to say.  Don't check the closet in my office.  There might be something in there.  That's all I'm going to say.  The hell do you have?  That's all I'm going to say.  All right.  I hope you're prepared for the ultimate competition today.  I have a little something up my sleeve, too.  All right.  Very good.  I bet it's not a slit wrist.  Why did I miss it? 
[02:43:30]  Too bad it's not a slit wrist.  You fucking guy.  You're a huge cock.  No.  All right, listen.  So I say I have a secret weapon, right?  I swear to you, if my life depended on it, I couldn't tell you what it is.  I don't remember this.  A bunch of t-shirts with slogans on it.  What, a magazine?  A blimp.  What kind of secret weapon would you have in a jerk-off contest?  Maybe you had audio from the blimp day, and you just listened to that and jerk-off, and 
[02:44:00]  you just came because it was so good.  Maybe a leftover bra.  Or was it a shirt with a little target that said, come here?  Nothing?  All right.  Wow.  Prepared for the ultimate competition today.  I have a little something up my sleeve, too.  All right.  Very good.  And something on your sleeve after you're done.  But that wouldn't be the contest. 
[02:44:30]  It has to go in a cup.  Right.  Well.  Right.  When we officially do this, you're going to hear more on the bed and how the event works.  Don the judge and his fancy microscope.  Man.  Hope he ends with another joke.  The testing procedure.  Own a sperm description.  Man.  Anthony in disguise.  Naming the specimen cups.  What was he dressed up as?  Because he's in disguise all the time.  If it's not stuff on my ear, is it?  I know.  Oh. 
[02:45:00]  What was he disguised as?  A guy not smiling?  I just am not doing this.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I just smile all the time.  I do this because the second I leave the studio, I'm crying.  I hate my wife.  I hate my whole fucking marriage.  Oh, God.  Someone is suggesting if I'm feeling tired that I should get some Crank 2-0.  Ah, that's true. 
[02:45:30]  He's lingering longer from two minutes ago.  Anthony in disguise.  Name in the specimen cups.  Yes.  A coin flip sperm joke slash Kippy Love.  Kippy Love.  Oh, my God.  Kippy Love is the tranny?  Jim, we had a tranny that used to do our show.  She was a regular.  Was she hot?  No, I don't remember.  Kippy Love sent a picture.  That's right.  Remember the picture?  Yeah.  Ant's Bob Dole joke.  Sperm bowl intro.  Oh, fuck no.  Up close and personal with O&A.  Sure, that's a good one.  Anthony checks out the room, brother man. 
[02:46:00]  Anthony is off and running.  Opie ends this segment appropriately.  Anthony completes the task at hand.  Wow, it took you a long time.  Opie is very hard to listen to in this.  Opie's turn.  Opie finishes.  The results are in.  All on the way.  You want to hear one more?  Of course I do.  All right, one more.  I want to put this on my iPod.  Just fucking work out to it.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  FU Friday in progress. 
[02:46:30]  What you got there?  I got the official stopwatch for sperm bowl 96.  That's for the secondary bet that we got going.  Yes, we're going to find out who has the higher sperm count.  The loser has to get in a car and crash into a wall with an airbag.  No way.  What?  No.  Somebody did that.  By the way, wait.  What the fuck?  Where did that come from?  And you're wrong.  The winner would be the one who crashed into the wall without an airbag.  Dude, no fucking way. 
[02:47:00]  We were sad.  Why don't I remember that?  I'm officially uncomfortable.  Because you have a concussion from crashing in a wall.  The loser.  But we goofed on that bit when it was done by another.  By a man cow?  Yeah.  And turd.  The loser had to.  That's a big risk.  We didn't actually do that, did we?  Did we take like an audio?  I really don't know.  I really don't know.  Don't put it past yourselves. 
[02:47:30]  You got up in a helicopter.  That's too easy to fake this one on the ground.  We're in an unmarked van going to an unmarked car to a discreet wall.  But it will be marked after I smash a vehicle into it.  Is it marked?  Absolutely guess.  I'm not sure.  It's an unmarked slash car with lights on it.  All right.  I really don't know.  Your guys' budget was incredible.  They just threw money away in those days, didn't they?  Flimps.  Crashed cars? 
[02:48:00]  Sure.  Just have them lying around?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Someone's suggesting...  This is horrible.  It's Jeff from New Jersey.  This bit is just like the other one we heard.  Two guys sitting in the studio playing with themselves.  To get in a car and crash into a wall with an airbag.  And the side bet...  I know this doesn't make sense to the average listener, but the side bet is whoever could  do the deed the quickest...  Whoever gets their sample the quickest, yes.  We'll get a case of beer from the other guy. 
[02:48:30]  Man, this is like high stress, though.  Well, that's why we're going for the quickest.  It's the same case of beer.  Oh, what?  It's high stress.  Very high stress.  It sure is.  But you know the weird thing is that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a giant disparity in the gifts.  First prize is a case of beer.  Second prize is you never walk again.  That was my impression of what people were supposed to sound like on the radio.  I never thought I was putting on some kind of voice, but I guess I was trying to put 
[02:49:00]  on some kind of voice.  You were speaking clear.  It was very new.  We actually jerked off, by the way, if people are wondering.  We didn't fake the jerking off thing.  Hope not.  Everything you came to work.  No, no, no.  That was...  Best, though.  Well, that's why we're going for the quickest, because we got a bunch of people with suits  trying to do business around here.  It's just a very embarrassing situation for both of us, so we figure the guy who does  it the quickest is actually winning in this situation. 
[02:49:30]  For all the fun and hijinks it is, hey, it's a little educational.  It's very educational.  We'll get to find out how he measures it and, you know, what's a good count, what's a bad  count.  Right.  You know, maybe we'll be helping some people who are having fertility problems out there,  Opie.  And here you go.  Right here is the official stopwatch.  That's it.  Why couldn't I make that sound like I didn't want to have to...  Anthony's sperm was frogs.  Why couldn't I make that sound like I was kidding that this is helping?  I don't know.  These days, whenever we say something like, oh, I think we're helping the retarded by doing 
[02:50:00]  this, you know we don't mean one fucking word of it.  I'm sitting here...  That actually sounded like, hey, and it's educational, people.  Yeah.  I'm sitting here going, will you be sarcastic for once, you fuck?  Of little pieces.  You mother hucker!  Mother hucker.  All you want is one wink.  Just...  Right.  That's all I'm...  One fucking wink.  That's all I'm listening for is like, one wink, one...  We're just fucking...  It wasn't there.  With everybody... 
[02:50:30]  No.  Not only is there no winks, but the one time where someone winks and you go, why'd you  wink?  Oh, no, no, I didn't.  There was just something in my eye.  Yeah.  That wasn't a wink.  It wasn't a wink, or it was.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Larry.  Gonna find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  What's up, Larry?  Yep.  Fucking mother...  I wanted to ask Amphan if he's got more wacky, kooky stuff for us.  Linger a lot longer.  If you don't like what you see, get the funk out. 
[02:51:00]  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Because I always...  What happened to George Burns?  All right.  Well, he sang Extreme.  Shut up.  I hate you, Jimmy.  All right.  Let's go back to this.  Here's the official stopwatch.  That's it.  Of Sperm Bowl 96.  We might have to...  That's it.  Stopwatch.  Huh?  We start when we start actually...  Or when we leave the studio.  We got to hash this out.  It's going to be kind of like an obstacle course.  You're going to start the stopwatch in the studio.  And then you got to run out?  And then the participant has to run down the hall with the little cup into our office, which 
[02:51:30]  is on the other side of the building.  So literally a couple dozen employees will have to check us out.  We get into our office, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, come running back, and we stop the watch.  Is that fair?  Yeah, but that could be a little awkward, too, man.  I can't believe it's true.  Dude, this whole...  You got to run through the halls with a cup of that?  Yes!  Dude, this whole...  What is your trip?  This whole thing is a very embarrassing thing.  I can't believe this isn't in the Olympics.  It's just unbelievable.  By the way, our office was a storage closet. 
[02:52:00]  That's what they thought of us and our wacky, kooky radio.  Full of cum and t-shirts.  Our desk would be piled up every day with new pieces of radio equipment.  With reams of paper and all that shit.  Holy mother of God.  Well, you know...  It's...  Me and Ovi are flabbergasted here.  It's one of those situations where you listen back and just go, what the...  Yeah.  I thought we were good. 
[02:52:30]  What happened?  I remember this show a little more than the other one.  The other one I barely remember.  I remember that we did something like that.  This one I remember a little more.  And my memory...  My memory was absolutely wrong.  Because I thought this was a good show.  If someone asked me...  I heard that you guys did a show called Sperm Bowl 96 or whatever.  I would have said, yeah, that was a really good show, man.  We had a great one that day.  But I remember...  I would absolutely say that.  Two other radio hosts that tried this, but they had an unofficial stopwatch. 
[02:53:00]  So they couldn't use it.  Well, the official stopwatch is...  Yes.  I mean, yeah.  Sponsored by...  Well, I mean, if you're going to use the actual footage...  You know what?  You know?  I say we do this.  Let's get it out of the way.  I believe it belongs on...  Can you do this on Free FM or no?  Free FM.  Fuck those fuckers.  Okay.  I'm going to be here full time soon anyway, right?  Hey. 
[02:53:30]  Don't fuel people's false speculation.  Earlier in this bit, you said you'll play this on TV on your show.  I guess you guys knew you weren't getting fired yet, so this bit has to be before the bra  dropping, right?  You're right.  I don't fucking know.  Well, I mean, if you put it together...  All right.  Let's play this next clip.  All right.  Sperm Bowl 96.  The only station that really rocks.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Don Newton, everyone. 
[02:54:00]  How you guys doing today?  The official judge of Sperm Bowl 96 has arrived.  He's got all his equipment and everything, man.  He's got a raincoat on, basically.  Raincoat?  I guess it's a lot...  Oh, God damn it.  You know, just in case it gets hit with a lot of cum.  You gave me way too much for that line.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm a laughing fucking hyena.  Hold on.  Do me a favor.  I'm going to reenact that moment.  I don't do...  Anthony's the brilliant impressions, but I'm going to do my...  Do you want me to just stop after that line? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll do my line and then stop.  Fucking Anthony Quivers.  Six has arrived.  He's got all his equipment and everything, man.  He's got a raincoat on, basically.  Ha ha ha!  No, you didn't!  A raincoat!  Ha ha!  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  I couldn't give it to that one, because Anthony Quivers was too fucking fast.  I'm just a chuckling douche. 
[02:55:00]  No, you're not.  You just had a few laughs.  Oh, you're having fun.  I told you!  Oh, fuck it.  God, I fucked it up.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Okay.  Fucking idiot.  I can't even do my current character anymore.  I'm so flabbergasted.  I'm a mess.  I will be depressed later today.  I fucking moved away from home for this shit.  I left my family and friends and the comfort of, like, Long Island for this? 
[02:55:30]  I'd have had seniority in the union.  You're looking at it totally the wrong way you should.  Dude, I missed Christmases with my family.  Nah, they would have been a big deal.  A bunch of shitty gifts under a fucking rotten half a tree.  This is great, because you can look back on this and go, wow, we're not these guys anyway.  That's the beauty of it.  But why bother?  God.  That's fun.  I love looking back on all the fucking stuff.  He's got a raincoat on, basically.  The stuff you did this week earlier.  Like, you want to just fucking look? 
[02:56:00]  Ha ha ha!  He put it right over that.  Ha ha ha!  He didn't get it out.  I heard it.  That was a really good one.  Yeah.  Well, you got it.  Stopped you good.  Don't get mad at me.  I don't think Anthony actually gets, like, actually angry with me.  Oh, I just want somebody else to be under the bus for a little bit.  He can't fit.  Well, boss, if you don't shut up, we'll throw you under the blimp.  Ha ha ha!  Get out of here!  That was hilarious!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, Jimmy, you fucking hoot! 
[02:56:30]  Oh, fuck.  Ha ha ha!  Someone is suggesting that we were in full Dr. Regalia.  Regalia.  And Dick Brady's leftovers from Wisconsin.  Opie, any chance we could linger lesser?  Ha ha ha!  He's got all his equipment and everything, man.  He's got a raincoat on, basically.  A raincoat.  I guess it's a lab coat, right?  Well, it is waterproof, so essentially it is.  I don't want to get anything on me.  Okay. 
[02:57:00]  I'm telling you, we're doing this for real.  People are convinced we're not actually going to do this today on the radio, but we are.  We're going to find...  You laugh like John Candy in Stripes.  Paces on this flight!  A movie on this flight!  A movie on this flight!  Ha ha ha!  The insecurity is coming through loud and clear, because I said, you know, people aren't  going to...  Aren't believing this, but we're really doing this one.  I know you guys didn't believe the other one, now that I think about it.  You didn't believe the blimp thing, did you?  But we're really going to fucking jerk our cocks until thump comes spewing out of the 
[02:57:30]  head.  Oh, no.  Well, if your audience back then is anything like now, they were doing the same thing.  Fuck!  Cock!  God.  Money.  Okay.  I'm telling you, we're doing this for real.  People are convinced we're not actually going to do this today on the radio, but we are.  We're going to find out, once and for all, who has a higher sperm count, either Anthony  or I, he has already given us our specimen cups.  Hey, wait a minute.  The seal's broken on mine.  Look at that.  Yeah, it is.  We'll get another one here.  We'll get extra ones just in case.  Where is...  Okay, the seal's good on this one. 
[02:58:00]  I'll use this one.  I don't want any...  Who knows what was in here?  It could have been tequila shots.  Okay.  So Don's here.  And he's going to count...  What were you going to drink out of the fucking cup?  Who gives a shit?  What else?  Tequila shots or...  And who gives a shit if there was anything else in the goddamn cup before you sploched in it?  Did I add anything?  Did I add anything to these fucking shows?  I mean, Opie's talking and I'm just...  Yeah!  Oh, God. 
[02:58:30]  Raincoat.  Just a repeating fucking parrot-cackling dick.  That's not true, dude.  You know how hard it is to actually fake a helicopter coming in?  Dude, I...  Shut it.  If I was...  I thought it was a helicopter.  I'm thinking, like, while that bit was happening, like, these nuts didn't tell me.  They actually went up in the air.  You would think we would have told that story to you at some point, Jim.  Very funny.  Like, oh, years ago, we actually took a blimp.  You were newer, dude.  You were just breaking yourself in.  I mean...  The reason you were there, because your awfulness kept his horrendous alive. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm way too excited to be there.  That Opie was a douche.  No, you weren't.  You gave Newton the appropriate introduction.  Like, fucking...  Like, fucking President fucking Kennedy just walked in.  Don Newton, everybody!  Who?  Oh, I would love...  Just so excited.  I would love to visit this Opie and Anthony.  This incarnation.  I used to love doing this.  I'll be honest with you. 
[02:59:30]  And just say...  It's a fucking drag every day now.  You guys stink.  Buff drink lots from D.C.  Opie.  People will believe you dropped balloons from a blimp, but they have trouble believing you  got a sperm count test.  Okay.  So Don's here.  And he's going to count these little buggers.  He's got a really fancy microscope, man.  That's...  Little buggers.  Wow.  Was Little House on the Prairie on back then? 
[03:00:00]  Uh, yeah.  Little buggers.  I didn't count these little buggers.  Here's another t-shirt for you.  Those little buggers.  People are wondering how old my fiancée was when I was doing this hack radio.  She was a little bugger.  Oh, there you go.  She had a play date with my little bugger, right?  She played in the schoolyard with my sperm because she was an egg at that... 
[03:00:30]  No, well, she was...  Twelve.  She was, uh...  Oof.  She was young.  They count these little buggers.  Yeah.  He's got a really fancy microscope, man.  That's great.  Reminds me of science class when I was in high school.  Yeah, it's from one of the docs at work.  They kind of don't know what I'm doing, so I asked to borrow a scope for a school project,  quote-unquote, snicker, snicker, and here it is.  What else did you bring?  You got some, uh...  A little bit.  What else did you bring?  You got some...  What else did you bring?  You got a microscope? 
[03:01:00]  Hey, what else did you bring?  I hope you brought a dildo to shove up my ass because I'm so excited to be here today.  Anthony, you were funny when you go.  It reminds me of science class.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a great...  That was me, again, contributing so much.  Well, it was like before when you said, uh...  Well, you know, I mean, uh, this actually could be very helpful.  Like, you're all...  You're like the all kid in the side, folks.  This does remind me, by the way.  All kid in the side.  Science is important, kids. 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  And this reminds me of one from science.  I mean...  Science class.  You do have an excuse.  Your father did make you and your brother shower together.  So...  There's no excuse for what I was doing there.  I had no fucking business being on the radio.  I had no business.  You?  Do you know in Philly, you should torture Al-Qaeda detainees with this garbage.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What else?  Come on. 
[03:02:00]  Looks like you brought a bag of tricks in.  Let's see what you got.  What else you got?  Slides from the microscope?  You sound like a girl on Dateline.  What's in the bag?  Hopefully you got something there that makes me a man.  Oh, die, old Opie.  Die!  You're dead to me.  Snicker, snicker, and here it is.  What else did you bring?  You got some...  A little normal saline.  We got some sterile pipettes.  Of course, the specimen cups.  Handy-dandy alcohol preps.  And the ever-popular counting chambers for the little bug-bumping chambers. 
[03:02:30]  What's so funny about alcohol preps?  Why am I repeating counting chambers?  Did you repeat counting chambers?  Why?  I didn't hear it.  You're like...  What's...  Fuck, what for...  Brooks.  Foster Brooks?  Foster Brooks.  Yes, he is.  He's kind of like a Foster Brooks.  He's just like coming out of drunken stupors.  Just repeating stuff.  Yeah.  Counting chamber.  Where's my vodka?  Counting chamber.  Right.  Oof. 
[03:03:00]  But you're laughing at alcohol swabs.  I know, dude.  I'm a fucking douche.  I fucking douche.  People think that I...  I'm repeating again.  People think I fake laugh now.  Well, hello.  Come a long way.  I don't laugh at alcohol fucking what?  I don't know.  Alcohol swabs.  Swabs.  This one's close.  Charlie from Ohio.  Two hacks, one cup.  Yeah.  The little bug-busters.  Counting chambers.  So after we...  Wait, do you have gloves, too?  I bought a case of them, I think. 
[03:03:30]  A case of rubber gloves.  I think I might want to use them.  Yeah, man.  This is unbelievable.  I know.  I'm definitely using them.  All right.  You got all your equipment, and Anthony and I sure have our equipment ready.  So...  Oh, wow.  No.  Yeah, because my cock is equipment.  The fact that he brought gloves was unbelievable.  It was unbelievably funny to us.  You got gloves?  Oh, my God.  That's outrageous.  I thought you were going to do this.  Son's gloves.  The fact that somebody else was preparing for this bit somewhere else. 
[03:04:00]  Why?  But you're laughing like he brought a box of fucking squirting flowers.  A box of hand buzzers when you shake.  A box of pepper chewing gum.  Whoopie cushions.  Holy shit.  You guys could go home, because I'm just going to beat up the old opie myself.  I don't need your help.  Yeah, now it's at the point where I can just listen to this.  I'm not cringing anymore.  I hate the guys that are on this tape. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, this is...  On this recording.  We're doing a Bill and Ted thing right now.  We're going back in time to fucking make fun of these fucking assholes.  Opie, can I get a ruling here?  Is Anthony happy to be there?  Fuck you.  Little two.  Cell phone dude.  You can always tell when Anthony's happy.  He's like, I, I, I, I, and then he's like...  Let me tell you something, Jimmy.  Let me tell you something.  This is just going to be unbelievable.  You can feel the euphoria that we're feeling, because we're going to be jerking off. 
[03:05:00]  Euphoria.  Euphoria.  Rubber gloves.  Fuck you.  I can hear Anthony's high cheekbones.  I'm going to have sperm bubbling out of my cock yet.  They're like, yeah, wait.  I can't.  I can't.  You look like assholes right now.  We certainly do.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[03:05:30]  That's a fucking perfect...  Perfect.  We were those two guys in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  We thought our fucking songs ruled.  Because that magic was yours.  That magic.  Those tapes.  There's magic on those tapes.  B-Rock, does it get better than this?  Yeah, it gets more disturbing, yes.  All right.  All right, cool.  Quick break.  Let's just do one break.  We're probably going to cut the first hour of today's show.  Cut the first hour.  You know, when we're just battling about the election. 
[03:06:00]  Don't forget, tonight, Friday's on Route 9.  More from Sperm Bowl 96 after this break.  Whether you like a mini-bitty, medium or enormous.

[03:06:30]  Jump around.  Opie Anthony!  All right, we're back on XAM Satellite Radio.  That's right.  Still looking back.  It's a day of looking back, I guess.  Enjoy it because I don't know when we'll be brave enough to do this again.  Although Jimmy's going to bring in his first TV appearance.  His first TV appearance on Friday night videos.  That I want to find.  Especially the never-air interview I do. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Where I'm just trying to be charming.  I just think that I'm Mr. TV.  Oh, I can't wait.  I'm a cunt.  I can't wait.  I have real stories of the Highway Patrol I'm trying to find.  Yep.  And I'm going to bring in.  You were in one of those?  Yeah, I was in one of those.  What do you play, a warehouse?  Yeah, a warehouse.  Wow.  I love warehouses.  Everything I say is a fucking softball.  It's good, man.  Everything I say is a potential home run.  A warehouse. 
[03:07:30]  Come on, now.  That's crazy.  I'm going to try to bring in Al and the Monkees, too, when I was in my hip improv group with  Dane Cook.  Oh, wow.  I'll wait until you've seen Dane's hair.  He looked like fucking all three Charlie's Angels put together.  Who was the best improver of you three?  We all sucked.  The one that left the group first.  Oh, sorry.  Okay, one bad one.  Hey.  You're going to get a cyst in your kidney. 
[03:08:00]  We're trying to understand this show from 12 years ago.  And the thing I was thinking, Anthony and I were definitely happy to be doing this radio  for people.  And it was getting a good reaction.  And it was.  I mean, I have.  I don't know how.  I don't know how either.  But the radios were good.  They were happy at the station.  I remember all that crap.  And then somewhere along the line, we found our voices because I blame Dave Douglas because  he would beat us down.  And I think he really wanted us to do truly like morning zoo type of shit. 
[03:08:30]  Like at least like this is hacky, but it's kind of edgy material that the presentation  sucks.  But to jerk off on the air, no one was doing that.  So you know what I mean?  So it was like we're kind of like have a morning zoo presentation, but our bits were kind  of quote edgy.  And Dave kept beating us down and he wanted us to do actual morning zoo bits.  And that's when the anger started getting injected into into the radio show.  And we finally found our voices like this is what we really want to fucking do. 
[03:09:00]  That's what it needed was that little pinch of anger.  There was no anger whatsoever in the shit.  Sarcasm something.  Yeah.  And we found that.  Thank God.  Because we did have like edgy stuff we thought would work on a show.  Thank God for the incompetence of Dave Dickless.  Because I read, because we went down memory lanes, the old receptionist from that station  wrote us.  I told, well, I told you, I read the note to Anthony this morning and she reminded, she 
[03:09:30]  didn't remind us, but she wrote in this little memo.  She goes, I remember you guys going into Dave Douglas's office every Monday.  So I guess we had a meeting with the program director.  That's hilarious.  Why would you ever do that?  That'll happen.  And I guess we had meetings every Monday that we were forced to have with him.  And she wrote in this note that I read in today.  She goes, I remember you guys leaving that office just fucking pissed every fucking Monday.  I never saw you guys leave that office happy once.  And then we'd go on the air and make believe we were happy.  Give a shit. 
[03:10:00]  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  We're in the middle of Sperm Bowl 1996.  Also known as Sperm Bowl 96.  The testing procedure.  I don't know if mine's ready.  This is really too much, man.  I don't know if mine's ready.  This is really too much, man.  How were you going to know when it was ready?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I'm smiling so much I can't even talk.  Let me get inside Anthony's brain.  I'm smiling on the outside because I don't want to kill myself. 
[03:10:30]  My life is driving me nuts and I don't know how to divorce her yet.  I'm just weeping and weeping.  And it's still three years before I'll get out of this marriage.  So, oh my God.  Help me, please.  You're always going to sound like you're wrapped in an air of mirth.  I don't know where the fuck that comes from.  You were just happy or lucky.  Oh, God.  But he wasn't happy.  Yeah, but you were banging nails four months before this. 
[03:11:00]  Now you're sitting in a studio.  Yeah.  Thank God for Opie's loneliness.  You would have never had a job.  You're obviously not there to contribute.  True you are.  Thank God Opie needed somebody else in the studio.  Oh, brother.  Really too much, man.  You know, when you talked about this a couple of months back, it all sounded fine and dandy.  But now that zero hours here, it's like, how the hell am I going to go into another office through a whole studio full of people and come out with everybody knowing exactly what I just did? 
[03:11:30]  And now he's got the saline solution here.  He's got test tube.  This looks very official and scientific in here.  And what's the procedure?  Basically, we're going to mix it in two mLs of saline and mix it up, let it sit for a few minutes.  I'm going to put a little bit on the counting chamber, and we're going to put it on a microscope, and the chamber itself has got marked off into squares, and we count the four squares, do a little multiplication, and tabulate the results.  You actually physically count these by eye? 
[03:12:00]  You see them actually squirming around?  Actually squirming around.  Well, what if one's hiding behind another one, man?  Well, then you just kind of...  Oh, wow.  Well, what if one sperm is, you know, fucking the other sperm in the ass, and you can't see the other sperm, man?  Hey, man.  Save me a poke.  Something must happen to him, man.  Who are you, Jim Morrison?  I'm actually enjoying the music bed.  Oh, yeah.  The never-ending fucking music bed.  That's right.  It does add something to the show, a little music behind it. 
[03:12:30]  They insisted that they have music beds to distract from the fact that you were listening to some shit.  It does.  You should add music beds to this show, like, you know.  It's a good idea.  Shut up.  A couple feedbacks.  Yeah.  It must be good.  Yeah.  This is like when you thought your dad was cool when you were young, and you found out he was a virgin until 21.  Yeah.  And then Philly Tyrant, were both of you guys still living together at this point, laying in bed at night, giggling and all proud of yourselves?  We jerked off together.  Tee hee. 
[03:13:00]  Tee hee.  Their little feet with socks on them sticking out from under their covers.  Here's, uh, some people I'm reading are suggesting I sound like this when I'm doing my smiling talking.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Not really.  Uh, the dialogue in the porno tapes was more believable.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Did you guys really live together at one point?  Uh, well, in Anthony's, uh, my mother-in-law's house.  My mother-in-law's house. 
[03:13:30]  He lasted about a month.  I stayed there over a year with his mother-in-law.  We're fucking pathetic, Bob Kelly.  If I ever see the old Opie on the street, I'm gonna fucking kick him in his cunt.  Just beat the piss out of both of them.  How you doing, future Anthony?  How's the radio business going?  Bam!  Right in the fucking face.  Right in the face with the gun you just bought.  You're like, why did he fucking punch me?  Hey, Jimmy, I gotta ask you.  You think old, uh, it's now old Opie and old Anthony, even though we're older, but, uh, 
[03:14:00]  this is the old Opie, the old Anthony.  Do you think, uh, they liked, uh, jerking off?  I think the old Opie and Anthony LOVED IT!  You do, huh?  Oh, all right.  One man.  Well, then you just kind of have to coax it out, maybe wink at it to get it to move or  something.  And don't be deceived, because I know Anthony's gonna have to.  I want to enjoy that joke.  Oh.  Oh.  Andy.  Anthony enjoyed that guy's joke a lot, huh? 
[03:14:30]  You like funny, Anthony.  You seem a little more detached from this show than the, uh, the, the air raid.  That's all I'm saying.  Maybe something was going on at home, I don't know.  I didn't find that to be a particularly good joke the guy told, but fucking Anthony acted  like you just heard fucking Pryor doing mud bones for the first time.  He's behind another one, man.  Well, then you just kind of have to coax it out, maybe wink at it to get it to move or  something.  And don't be deceived, because I know Anthony's gonna have big afros on him, man.  Oh, shit.  Hold on, you interrupted another Anthony laugh. 
[03:15:00]  Another laugh.  Shut up!  See, um, all my jokes had to end with man.  And I was trying to make a joke that Anthony's sperm would have afros on him.  Right.  Because he has curly hair.  Yeah, yeah.  He has curly hair.  Hair.  Man.  And don't be deceived, because I know Anthony is going to have big afros on him, man.  It's going to look like there's a lot in there clumped together, but that's going to be one  sperm-y, man.  Mine will be drinking a bud and smoking putts. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  And mine will be swimming all over the freaking slide like a madman.  And just so you know, Anthony, one big one does not equal like 20 little ones.  Oh, really?  I was worrying about that yesterday.  I thought maybe just one big one coming out of it.  All right.  Well, Don is here.  The official judge of Spurral 96.  Don't try to make any run.  I'm getting a little nervous, man.  The pregame show continues.  We're going to talk to Kippy Love next from P-Pan.  Why?  Why?  Wait a minute.  I'll tell you why.  Kippy Love is going to flip the coin.  This is going to take me all day now.  Kippy will be flipping the coin to see if it's Anthony or I that have to go into that little 
[03:16:00]  office first to get our little specimen.  Stay right there, man.  Well, man.  All right.  Listen, man.  Listen, man.  Ah.  Who do you sound like, man?  Who said man like that?  Hey, man.  Come on, man.  Hey, man.  Save me a poke.  No, but I can hear it.  It sounds like a...  Hey, man.  It was a girl.  It was a girl.  It was a movie or something.  It must have been a girl.  No, but I just...  It was a... 
[03:16:30]  Hey, man.  Somebody high.  He said...  You can't kill me, man.  Oh, Justine Jolie.  That's it.  God damn it.  Good call.  Not me, though.  Eric from Raleigh.  That's who it is.  Road Warrior.  Very good.  Mad Max.  So, should we continue with Sperm Bowl 96?  Yeah, we should, man.  It's like saying, should we continue breathing, man?  Man.  Well...  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  This next clip.  Anthony, what would you do to the old Anthony?  I'd walk up to him in his shithole in Ashland. 
[03:17:00]  Yep.  And I'd knock on the door.  Yes.  Some drunk would probably answer.  Get me.  Bring me to the door.  And then I would say, hey, old 1996 Anthony, how are you enjoying radio?  I'm just loving it.  It's fantastic.  I've been here for over 20 years.  I really am.  I'm digging it.  And then in the middle of that, I would curl up my fist and punch him square in the nose 
[03:17:30]  and just lay him out, bleeding on that shitty carpet that was soaked with beer and cigarette  ashes.  And tears.  And lots of tears.  Well...  And unhappiness.  In this next clip, the old Anthony.  Throw him off the balcony.  Let's call him the old Anthony now.  Decides he needs to put on a disguise because he's embarrassed.  To...  Well, for the wrong reason.  I should have put on a disguise because I was embarrassed of the show. 
[03:18:00]  Anthony's getting really nervous.  Check out the disguise that Anthony's got on now.  See, I usually wear my hat.  Right.  And the ponytail.  Right.  And today, I just let my hair down and I got sunglasses on.  This way, when this airs on our TV show, Real Rock Television, no one will recognize  me when I'm out on the streets.  You're wiping out so bad, dude.  I'm not going to get being in shawls or something.  So, a six-year-old boy just walked into that studio and I want to hear what he said.  You're wiping out so bad, dude. 
[03:18:30]  What the fuck?  Why?  Well, you were wiping out bad, dude.  This is just getting worse and worse to listen to.  And Anthony had his Superman disguise.  Like, whoa, look.  I put my hair down.  No one's going to recognize me.  I got sunglasses on and...  Fucking Clark Kent disguise.  They're going to say, hey, why is Cher jerking off?  You're wiping out so bad, dude.  I'm not going to be in shawls or something and go, hey, there's the guy that was... 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, look at him with the cucumbers over there.  He looks like a pro.  Be a man.  Come on.  Don Newton is an official lab technician.  He's got a microscope, some slides.  What else you got there, Don?  Counting chamber.  Counting chamber, a little saline.  Of course, those all-important specimen cups there, fellas.  Mine is still sealed.  Mine is still sealed.  And you got clubs, too, right?  Absolutely.  Mine's labeled Spanky.  I think that's Spanky.  And Opie's is labeled Tug.  No, mine actually says, punch the clown. 
[03:19:30]  I'm Spanky and you're Tug.  Yeah.  It had to be said twice.  I had to say it twice.  Just in case you missed it.  Because I'm going to jerk off.  If I'm Spanky and I'm Tug, you should have said, I'm awful.  And the other guy, she said, I am, too.  I don't know what to say anymore.  Yeah, this is really.  This is so bad.  Sorry. 
[03:20:00]  Are you wimping out on us?  Hey, Kenny.  Could I get something cakey?  Sure.  Not flaky.  Like a marbly, cakey, muffin-y thing?  Sure.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, could you get him?  It's called the new Marble Loaf Shotgun Blast to the Face.  I'd like the treat.  I would definitely take that one.  Thank you, my love.  Oh, this is painful.  Hurry up and just get Anthony's.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Noel in Boston.  Noel.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey. 
[03:20:30]  Good evening.  Are you the voice behind Evil Barney?  Yes, I absolutely was.  Yeah, I was just watching that on YouTube.  We got it.  Let it go.  Oh, boy.  Yes, I used to do Evil Barney, and he would.  We'll bring in some Evil Barney.  Teach the kids horrible things.  I think you have.  Where's the Evil Barney babysitter?  Oh, is that really you, Ant?  Evil Barney?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I did the Evil Barney.  Oh, boy, kids.  Do we have Evil Barney from Demented World? 
[03:21:00]  Ask G-Rock.  Do you think that's a funny one?  No, I don't.  I don't.  I'm doing Scooby-Doo on Cracked, my new character.  Do you ever notice that, like, Shaggy?  No, I didn't.  No.  I didn't notice that.  I'm going to do Casper the Unfriendly Ghost.  Ready?  Boo, cunt.  Ready?  Boo.  Ready?  Yeah.  Let's go.  Every sperm ball has the official coin toss.  Right.  So we're going to have Kippy Love.  What?  The official coin toss.  Coin.  Every sperm ball has the official coin toss. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  So we're going to have Kippy Love do the coin toss to find out who goes first.  All right.  You want me to pick one?  Yeah.  All right.  Heads.  Heads.  Heads.  Figures you'd pick heads on Sperm Bowl 96.  That's a good one.  Hey, everybody.  That's a good one.  You got him on that.  What are you going to do?  Deny it?  Make sure you tip your waitresses.  They're working really hard, though.  Was I eating cigarettes while I wasn't smoking them, too? 
[03:22:00]  It's got, like, fucking gravel.  Oh.  Firm Bowl 96.  Oh, I'm not going to pick tails.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  All right.  Touche, man.  Touche.  You got heads.  I got tails.  The phone is ringing in P-Town.  Whatever Kippy flips, all right, that person has to go first.  Don't let her talk so much.  All right.  Well, so if she goes heads, then you go first.  If she says tails, I go first. 
[03:22:30]  Deal?  The phone's ringing.  Laugh.  Hello.  It's a call.  Kippy, laugh.  I just laughed at the phone.  I really just laughed at the ringing phone.  Ring.  Ha, ha, ha.  What the fuck is wrong?  What is that?  Mescaline?  You're like Ed McMahon.  You're doing like an Ed McMahon.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  How about that fucking telephone?  Ring it.  Funniest thing I've ever heard.  It's literally ring. 
[03:23:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Certain rings can be funny.  Hello, it's Tom.  Kippy, low.  Hi, boys.  How are you?  Good, good.  We're getting a little nervous.  It's less than an hour away before we actually do the deed for Sperm Bowl 96.  Oh, I can't wait.  Now, Kippy, who are you rooting for today?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Anthony's Italian, and we're going for the higher sperm count.  And you are?  I'm a mutt. 
[03:23:30]  Ooh.  Hmm.  Come on, Kip.  Who are you pulling for?  I don't know.  I'm so fond of both of you, and it's really hard for me to make a decision.  Stop jerking around and tell us who you want.  Really?  Can I come up and measure?  No.  It's all in the delivery.  It's true.  That one was fucking...  That was delivered in a diaper wrapped up.  Tell her to stop jerking off. 
[03:24:00]  When you delivered that joke, I can actually see your hands opening and your head bobbing  to the left to the right.  For the love of God.  Stop jerking around and tell us who you want.  Really?  Can I come up and measure?  No.  No.  Please.  No.  This is ruining everything.  Okay.  I'm going to wait for the Italians.  Yeah!  I didn't want a rooting for me. 
[03:24:30]  What?  This is great.  Too bad.  Well, thanks, Kip.  By the sound of old Opie's voice, it sounds like he actually wanted.  Fucking Kip.  You love rooting for him, you faggot.  You fucking faggot.  Do you just hate old Opie?  Now I know what's...  Yes.  Now I know what is in the special weapon in my fucking closet.  It's a fucking dude.  That fucking old Opie's a fucking cocksucking faggot.  Holy shit. 
[03:25:00]  Left home for this bullshit.  Oh, fuck.  Horrid.  It's the only word I got.  Horrid.  Holy shit.  There's no excuse.  I'm not even uncomfortable anymore.  I want to punch this kid in the face.  This kid.  Why?  He just was a little overzealous.  Yelled a lot.  Fuck.  He did yell a lot.  I was on the crank 2-0.  Took the place of the cocaine.  It was healthier.  And I was just...  Well, yeah.  Well, thanks, Kip. 
[03:25:30]  He wants Anthony to win!  Shut the fuck up, Opie.  All right, Kip, you want to do the official coin toss for Sperm Bowl 96?  Uh-huh, definitely.  You are going to decide who has to do...  If I fucking cheer because Anthony goes first and I don't even know, I'm going, give me  something hit over my head.  You can't get to the...  If I cheer over a fucking coin toss...  You can't get to the old Opie through yourself, the new Opie.  How about this?  Just remember that.  Don't hurt yourself.  If you cheer, you can't be mad at yourself if he somehow laughs. 
[03:26:00]  All right, deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I'm sure I'll chuckle.  Yeah, now we can guess what the old Opie's going to do and the old Anthony's going to do.  I just know what they're going to do.  Definitely.  You are going to decide who has to do the deed first.  Okay, listen.  It's Hed's boy.  No, no, no, no!  No!  Anthony has to go first!  Son of a...  It's Hed's.  Wouldn't it be Hed's? 
[03:26:30]  I don't want to go first.  Wouldn't it be Hed's?  Wouldn't it be Hed's?  Oh, this is terrible.  Oh, come on.  Yes, it certainly is, old Anthony.  I hope he's smashing his head.  I hope he's hitting himself.  For the water bottle.  Holy crap.  I summed it up right there.  This is terrible.  Oh, my God.  Here's Opie's reaction to the coin toss.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:00]  So I was...  That cheer could be the greatest thing I've heard in five years.  That was a phenomenal one.  Let's go to the phones.  Why would it matter who fucking jerked off first?  I don't know, but there was such a joy in it.  Such joy.  Oh, this is terrible.  Oh, come on.  Come on, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  I get the after-sex smoke faster. 
[03:27:30]  Anthony, get my picture out.  Oh, no.  Put on some lace panties.  Stop it.  Stop it.  No.  Anthony, I'll talk dirty to you while you're doing it.  I'm not listening.  Anthony, I'll talk dirty to you.  I'm not listening.  Don't get me locked.  La, la, la.  My ears are plugged.  Come on, Anthony.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Lucky you.  Thank you for taking the coin, Kippy.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, fucking you.  Oh, fucking hell.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Plow through. 
[03:28:30]  Wish there was a way to do this other than taking a sample the manual way.  Anthony is going first.  I have to go first.  What is that all about?  And look at the device he has picked for Spermball 96.  Well, there's this mouth-looking thing.  What is that all about?  I have to go first.  What is that all about?  It's about you have to go first?  It's not really a big mystery that you have to figure out what it's about.  Well, what it's about is that someone has to go first, and you have to go first.  I want to grab myself, old Anthony, by his stupid ponytail, and I want to open his mouth, 
[03:29:00]  put it on the edge of the curb, and stomp him like American History X.  I hate old Anthony.  Would that be in your disguise, or would that be...  No, no, not my disguise.  How many people have...  That's just me.  How many people have, like, old audio themselves that they can listen to and get douche chills from?  Not many.  Not many.  Douche chills seems to be the worst.  Well, there's this mouth-looking thing that you're supposed to use menus to, you know...  And then there's a hand. 
[03:29:30]  It's a battery-powered, vibrating hand.  Right.  I mean, I got one of these.  Where are you going to buy one?  Dude, put a pen in it.  Yeah, you can put a pen in it.  Look, it's Bob Dole.  And Bob Dole's hand vibrates.  Bob Dole will help you.  All right, so which device are you going to use for Spermball 96?  Opie, I'm going to pass on all devices and go with good old-fashioned manual dexterity.  I think I'm going to use the southpaw stance. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, wow.  Shut up!  See, because jerking off with your left hand is funny.  Yeah, it's just hysterical.  Does anybody remember last time?  Oh, my God.  Don't worry about that.  There's plenty coming from my fucking hackling fucking mouth.  You are a fucking moron!  Apparently so.  Well, before break...  Before break, here's the big... 
[03:30:30]  I want to apologize to everybody that listened back then.  I want to apologize to everyone that believed in us.  Yeah, yeah.  We obviously let you down.  I don't know what happened.  I don't remember ever signing a contract with Satan, but I had to have.  It had to have been signed at some point.  My soul is gone. 
[03:31:00]  This is the worst radio I've ever heard.  I can say this is the worst radio I've ever heard.  No, it's not.  Who's worse?  No, the other one you played earlier.  There was some hope in our eyes, too.  Oh, Jimmy, really?  The blimp guy.  I thought you were going to say Scott and Todd or something. 
[03:31:30]  That pilot sucked.  Me and Boss just banged our heads getting that one out together.  We actually tripped.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, the waiting is...  Oh, we had an official intro.  Hey, we needed the big intro, didn't we?  Remember when we used to actually do production?  Ladies and gentlemen, the waiting is over.  It's all come down to this.  Today is the day.  No more hype.  No more jerking around. 
[03:32:00]  Today, bragging rights will go to one man.  Who will be the man with the golden gonads?  We'll find out soon as we kick off Sperm Bowl 96.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's official.  The lighting of the torch or whatever the hell they light.  It sure doesn't look like a torch, bro.  All right.  We need an up close and personal from Anthony.  Are we doing like the Olympics?  They did the up close and personal?  Yes. 
[03:32:30]  Okay.  Well, actually, Ope, you know,  I'm doing this for my grandfather  who recently passed away last year.  I know he's up there somewhere pulling for me  and I'm going to be down here pulling for him.  All right.  That's right.  Do you have an up close and personal?  Yes.  Actually, I'm going to be doing it for every kid  that has been caught in the bathroom by their mom.  Very noble.  Very noble of you.  Boy, I had a whole week to think of a witty line.  That wasn't off the cuff, people. 
[03:33:00]  That was written in advance.  Yeah.  I had a whole week and that's what I came up with.  That was the brilliance of me back in 96.  This is fucking terrible.  I can't believe I didn't get that call from Hollywood.  You know, to write for a sitcom.  How?  Holy crap.  That was not off the cuff.  That was like, all right, let's do a little up close and personal.  Think about why you're doing this.  This is major market radio. 
[03:33:30]  Afternoon, major market radio, and it sounds like fucking college radio.  Dude, if I could go-  Like bad college radio.  If I could go-  Community college.  If I could go back into a time machine, I would take Old Ope.  Old Opey.  And I'd fuck him in the mouth.  Yeah, and he'd let you.  You'd have to take the old Anthony so he could fly the time machine.  Hey, look, he's fucking him in the mouth. 
[03:34:00]  And it wouldn't be gay because I'd be angry.  Yeah, you'd be all mad.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be an angry-  Fucking your young self in the mouth.  Oh, my God.  What are you going to think about to come quick?  The leaves?  Oh, well.  That was good.  Thank you, Rich.  Any second that gets the attention off of this.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Before break, we'll get this in. 
[03:34:30]  You were checking for cameras?  Real fast, dude.  We got to get back into tunes here.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Let me do a little setup.  We now have Anthony in the jerk-off room, which was our office.  And now I'm about to check it in with him.  The jerk-off room?  No, that was called the studio.  And Anthony's very nervous that there might be cameras back in 1996.  You know how big the fucking cameras were to have to be?  Oh, wow.  You were checking for cameras?  Real fast, dude.  We got to get back into tunes here.  Is the room safe? 
[03:35:00]  I think it is.  Okay.  I'm just hoping Rocco didn't pull anything.  Well, you never know, man.  I'm going to put a blanket over myself just in case there's a hidden camera in there, man.  But we are 15 minutes away before you go into that room.  Why do I have to be first?  Hey, you lost the coin toss, brother man.  Jane's Addiction.  Next time we talk, Anthony, heads on down the hall.  See, I was a big Doris fan.  Heads on down the hall. 
[03:35:30]  I wish you'd have played the end.  Oh, Jesus.  Brother man.  That brother man just never quite took off.  Well, it became a movie, right?  Martin Lawrence, wasn't it?  Or somebody did brother man the movie?  Maybe they ripped me off.  Took off like a helicopter and landed on Vic Morrow.  When we get back, we're going to wrap this up with Anthony is off and running. 
[03:36:00]  Anthony completes.  Then it's my turn.  I complete.  And then we give you the results.  And we're back.  We were just explaining to these guys that we definitely changed before we came to New York.  Like the last year, year and a half we were in Boston, it's like night and day to what you're hearing today.  We just got mean.  Really mean.  Awful.  It all kind of started coming together.  Hey, all right.  So we're in the middle of Sperm Bowl 96 and Anthony is off and running. 
[03:36:30]  Great.  Here we go.  Take your headphones off.  This is a disgrace.  I think I'm ringing.  Yes, it is.  Pick me up.  Is that you, dude?  No, Opie.  Okay, Anthony.  I'm entirely different.  All right, Anthony is on the cell phone.  Oh, this is horrible.  Anthony is getting up.  I got my...  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Unlike our other show we did for you this morning, we were actually going to jerk off here.  Got to pull down the wall.  We're not faking the jerking off one at a time.  Unlike the first show, what do you think you were doing during that whole time? 
[03:37:00]  We are actually jerking off for this bit.  Oh, this is horrible.  Anthony is getting up.  I got my...  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  I got the key to the room.  Okay.  I need a newspaper to put over my head.  Okay.  Like a criminal leaving court.  Okay, Anthony is walking out of the studio.  Oh, what a disgrace.  Oh, I'm just great.  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  I'm running through a gauntlet of people. 
[03:37:30]  All these people are clapping.  This is horrible.  This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.  Everybody's clapping.  Anthony is walking down the hall.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  Ozone is in the studio, bro.  All right.  Where are you, Ant?  All right.  Hey, Ozone from the Ozone midget signing.  It's Ozone, man.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Come on.  Ozone.  Ozone rules.  This is the first time people are going to hear Ozone's voice on John Osterlin on our  show.  In the studio, bro.  All right.  Where are you, Ant?  All right.  I'm at the door. 
[03:38:00]  I'm opening up the door.  The door of the room.  Anybody in here?  Oh, my God.  Here is the room.  Okay.  Oh, look.  It's Cindy Crawford's calendar.  All right.  That could help.  Anthony, as soon as you're ready to go, I'm going to start the clock because, you know,  the person that finishes the soonest will win that case of beer.  All right.  Wait.  I got to find something good to use in here.  What?  Ian's with the camera in here.  I can't do this with a camera rolling.  You know what?  Ian.  Yeah.  Here comes a get out of here, dude. 
[03:38:30]  I'm sure.  Ian, get out.  Get out.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  We got Jared, our intern.  He's watching the door.  So no one, you know, walks in on Ant.  The door's shut.  Let me check if it's locked.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's locked.  All right.  I got to stop watching my hand, bro.  Good luck to you.  Are you ready?  Yep.  The official stopwatch.  Start the clock.  You're on the clock. 
[03:39:00]  Let the spanking begin.  And there's the official horn.  Are you still there, Anthony?  The official horn.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I'm praying right now for the official studio fire.  It's the official lack of irony horn.  The official carbon monoxide leak.  Oh, my God.  I can feel myself turning red. 
[03:39:30]  Let me tell you something.  I am going to go back in time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm going to find old Opie.  He's probably still living with Anthony's mother-in-law.  And I'm going to take a hatchet to his fucking ball bag so he can never reproduce.  I want the official horn.  Not just any horn.  No, it's the official horn.  It's the official brother man horn.  After the official stopwatch got started.  You certainly need a horn because this bit blows. 
[03:40:00]  The official horn, people.  Not just any horn.  See?  This wouldn't be official.  No, no, no.  It's got to be the official horn.  Oh, God.  It's this fucking horrible whistle horn.  Are you still there, Anthony?  Anthony has hung up the phone.  He is in mid-cuffing, I guess you'd have to say.  So, Anthony is in the room.  He is doing the deed as I speak.  He's up to 30 seconds and counting.  I mean, he's going to last a lot longer than that, I hope.  Okay?  As soon as Anthony is done, we cut into the music, we cut into the commercials, whatever. 
[03:40:30]  As soon as he's done, we pop right back on mic.  Even if it's a wicked cool tune, man?  Yeah, we'll just play the wicked cool tune over again.  That's all.  All right?  So, Anthony's in the room.  He's up to 45 seconds.  I don't even notice sarcasm.  He presented it to me.  He just gave it to you.  And I had to explain it like it was a real fucking question.  He did.  And he was like, he was goofing on me.  Yeah, we did a wicked good tune. 
[03:41:00]  He's like, yeah, yeah, no, we'll cut in.  No, we'll cut in.  Hey, don't you worry about it.  Don't you worry.  We'll play your wicked cool tune.  Yeah, we'll just play the wicked cool tune over again.  That's all.  All right?  So, Anthony's in the room.  He's up to 45 seconds.  I got the appropriate tune.  Good luck, brother man.  All right.  He can hear my voice right now.  Oh, look at you, Eric.  Oh, you girl.  It's Hey Masturbator.  Wow.  Yeah, but see, you missed the brilliance of me from the old days where I was like mocking  you because you had the radio on. 
[03:41:30]  Wow.  Just go home.  Really?  Just shut your radios off.  And go home.  Why bother anymore?  I want to hear more.  Why bother?  The official horn.  I know.  The official cup.  Here we go.  The official raincoat.  Do we cut back to where he's done, like the next day?  Yeah, here we go.  Here it is.  Next day.  Here it is.  The phone is ringing.  Hold on a minute here.  Good luck.  Oh, are you cracking under the pressure? 
[03:42:00]  Good luck.  Are you done?  You are going to have a tough time at this, my friend.  Are you done?  Click the stopwatch.  You're done?  Dunski.  Ah!  Oh, Dunski?  Dunski.  All right, come on back at this.  Dunski.  Dunski.  You can see that on a t-shirt.  Come on.  Dunski.  Yeah.  Dunski.  Maybe Dung-ski, because it's a shit.  Yeah.  The douche-ki. 
[03:42:30]  Dunski was fine, actually.  It was funny.  I'm not even joking.  It's like, you have to get a jerk off to say Dunski, and that's actually, you know,  that's actually silly.  Yeah, it's silly.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  That was one you shouldn't feel better.  Joe?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Listen to this old audio.  It already sounds like you had a hatchet to hit your ball bag, you old high-pitch dude.  You guys stunk.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, come on back in the studio, man.  No.  Why?  I'm embarrassed.  Dude, you really did it.  Oh, dude.  It sucked.  You came in at 11 minutes and 15 seconds.  Everyone started saying that you were cracking under the pressure, man.  Well, it's true.  You do crack under the pressure.  Terrible.  Are you coming back in or what?  No.  Can I do the rest of the show from the phone?  How much of the cup did you get filled, man? 
[03:43:30]  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, four or five, Bubba.  I can do it.  Come on.  No.  See, because I believed them.  Four or five cups were filled up.  It's not, you know.  Because I had no clue.  Sarcasm or anything.  I had no clue what sarcasm was.  I made an ass of myself.  See, everything I had to believe, you know, as the truth.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're a sweet, trusting boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was just so happy. 
[03:44:00]  All right.  I can do it.  Come on.  No, he's got to bring the cup back, man.  You've got to bring the cup back to make it official, dude.  All right.  All right.  Ian is coming down the hall with the camera.  You've got to come now, dude.  With a strife.  All right.  If you're just doing it again, Anthony has finished the first half of Sperm Bowl 96.  He clocks in at 11 minutes and 15 seconds.  Good luck.  Are you coming down the hall?  Where are you, bro?  I'm waiting for Ian.  You're waiting?  You're still in the office?  Yeah.  I don't want to come out.  You don't want to come out? 
[03:44:30]  Do I have to?  I'll be in in two seconds.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is on his way back into the studio.  Oh, back in the studio.  Yeah.  No shit.  No shit.  Jimmy Jakes writes, using ski works because the show is going downhill the minute it started.  Do you hate the old LB?  I hate these guys.  As much as I do?  I fucking hate these guys.  I would love to go up against them. 
[03:45:00]  I'd love to see that too.  Well, it's my turn.  We could fucking rip this show apart.  You'd have to be careful if you went up against them.  They might drop balloons down on your head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, would they be scary?  Two guys in suits.  I'm going to make this next segment fun.  Listen to old Opie try to sound like a man.  All right.  I already know.  I already know how this old douche used to think.  You watch.  He's going to be a man. 
[03:45:30]  This is fucking painful.  You're going to hear me trying to be a man, a rock star, and hopefully come up with another  slogan that could be on a fucking t-shirt.  Kill yourself.  That would have been one.  A one-off.  One just for you.  He's back in the studio, everyone.  All right.  The only station that really rocks. 
[03:46:00]  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Make sure you get the call letters in, you know, because that's how they teach in broadcasting  school.  All hell's breaking loose, but make sure you get the call letters in.  I just like that everything's a moment.  Like, no matter what somebody's doing.  And I just put down a soda.  He was having some pop, but he's done with it now.  We're back.  You're absolutely right.  It's like so many moments happening.  Everything was a big event.  Yeah.  Didn't matter what it was.  And then he would just say something silly like that.  Like, you know, and he put his coffee down, and you would go, yeah, coffee down. 
[03:46:30]  What?  Oh, that's right.  Sounds like an old producer of ours.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  Well, there you go.  He's back in the studio, everyone.  All right.  The only station that really rocks.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony, and it's Don Newton.  Anthony is back from his little escapade.  I was giving a sample for a scientific experiment.  Sperm Bowl 96.  Anthony officially finished in 11 minutes, 15 seconds. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Don is actually holding the specimen top.  Oh, please.  He's got the gloves on, and he's got the raincoat, so I think he's well protected.  All right.  Now he's going to put those little buggers under the microscope after we get yours.  All right.  All right.  Well, how long can that sit before it's about an hour, but it shouldn't take you that long,  should it?  I hope not.  Let me tell you something, pal.  You best do it.  The first, how long did it take me?  11 minutes, 15 seconds.  All right.  The first, I think, 10 minutes was spent unplugging the phones in there, because every 
[03:47:30]  time you try to get going, you hear, Bruce Mintman, pick up line two, Bruce line two.  All right.  All right.  Well, anyway.  All right.  What's true?  Just keep moving the show along.  Just keep moving the show along.  That's your job.  So fuck yourself.  Well, that's funny, but let's move along here, because, you know, we got to get another  tupper on.  That's right, homie.  Tupper.  And give away the tickets for Ticket Plits Thursday, but I don't want to laugh too much, 
[03:48:00]  because, you know, something's going to be dropped for the program.  Oh, fucking douche.  I would just, I'd love to contribute something.  I'm depressed.  And it took you 10 minutes to unplug phones.  See, these guys aren't even talking anymore.  No, this, everyone's drained.  Yeah.  And they should be.  We're just about done.  I'm enjoying this.  Uh, Bruce Mintman, pick up line two, Bruce line two.  All right.  Well, you did well, Ant.  Well, thank you, homie. 
[03:48:30]  Get him back down.  Have you dialed up the phone, bro?  Yeah.  Is the cell phone ringing, bro?  Oh, boy.  Are you a bro, bro?  Bro, bro, bro.  Is that it?  Is that it?  Talk, talk, talk, talk.  Hello?  Talk.  No.  Technical difficult.  Oh, it just hung up, dude.  All right.  Call back real fast.  I'll get it real quick.  Real quick.  I tell you, you have a problem, man, when you have to go in there, because it is distracting.  And then you got to run through the gauntlet of people in the hallway.  All right.  And they're patting you on the back, and you'll feel like a...  Dude, I'm ready. 
[03:49:00]  As soon as you give me that phone, man.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm tired.  It's a waste, and I want to get this up.  There it is.  All right.  Here we go.  Is that you?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Give me the phone.  Here.  Switch places.  All right.  I got the cell phone.  I got my specimen cup.  All right.  Drop watch.  When do I hit this...  Why?  What?  What?  What's the matter, Opie?  I'm just disgusted.  What'd you hear that you didn't like?  It would be so hard to be a man, a rock star. 
[03:49:30]  I'll probably be waving to the people in the hall, because I like the attention.  Oh, God.  Looking on their faces, hoping that they're liking this.  I know exactly what I'm about to do, because this is what I got rid of a long time ago.  This is why I hate this today.  Oh, listen to me be just so fucking cool.  What's up?  All right.  Stop watch.  When do I hit the stop watch? 
[03:50:00]  When you announce that you're...  Yeah, when I officially start, dude.  I'm walking down the hall.  Okay.  No one is here to greet me.  That's cool, though.  It's not, though, because, you know...  No.  Because I already...  Because I wanted them all there lining the hall.  Yeah, because even this early on, I knew people liked Anthony more than me, so, you know...  Jeez!  He got the big, like, whoa, Anthony, whoa!  And I already knew no one would be there for me.  It's because I was laugh clown laugh guy.  Ugh.  Just laugh.  And then I had to go, but that's cool, man.  You know, because I'm a rebel. 
[03:50:30]  It's all right.  I didn't really want anyone out here anyway.  How could you not like me when I was laughing all the time?  And then going home...  My life sucks.  You know what I was doing?  I closed that door, and the guy that's all happy to be there laughing, this is me.  Jacking off, crying.  Crying and jacking at the same time.  They didn't have to add salient to your sperm.  Your tears were in it.  Right.  No, it's cool that no one's there to see me jerk off.  No, it's all right.  I feel you. 
[03:51:00]  It doesn't bring up issues from when I was a kid or nothing.  Where my mom was in a fucking attic instead of paying attention to me.  Jesus Christ.  Norman Bates.  Yeah, let's...  Waka waka.  No, it's cool.  It's just like when I was playing basketball, thinking I was going to be in the NBA, and my  mom didn't show up to the game.  No, just like that.  It's cool.  Don't worry about it.  I'm used to this.  I officially started.  I'm walking down the hall.  Okay.  No one is here to greet me.  That's cool, though.  That sounds so sad.  Thank you.  No one's there to greet me. 
[03:51:30]  There you go.  They're yelling from their offices, man.  I got a procession.  Go get a burger.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, fans.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Andy, what a dick.  I got a procession.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And by the way, because we've proven all morning that we did.  We didn't understand sarcasm.  So when I said, thank you, fans, I really thought the people I worked with were fans  of the show, not co-workers that, yeah, I know.  You're lucky to have me here, people. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Brother Man t-shirts all free to you guys.  You guys will get the first batch for free.  Don't worry about it.  If you want a second one for, you know, a loved one, you're going to have to pay half  price.  You're paying for Mother Hucker t-shirts.  Right.  Thank you.  He's thanking the crowd.  All right, dude.  He is in for some pressure, man.  Oh, my God.  People are leaving work.  Hi, sir.  It's rough.  It's really rough.  Jared is opening the key to the room.  All right.  I'm in.  He's in.  Hey, dude.  Did you keep it dark in here? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  What do you think I was going to do?  All right.  That's cool.  I turned the lights out.  Of course.  All right.  You think I'm crazy?  Oh, dude.  I can't do this.  You have to now, pal.  If I back out, I look like a wimp, huh?  All right.  What are you doing?  I'm pulling my jeans down.  Wait.  Get off the phone before you go.  I'm not naked yet.  Is that door?  Ian, get the freak out of here.  Get out of here.  He's got the camera on him.  What is wrong with this camera guy?  Dude, get out of here.  Out.  He really is.  Leave.  Leave. 
[03:53:00]  Uh-oh.  All right, dude.  It is getting his testosterone level up.  I'm ready.  Are you ready, O?  All right.  I put a chair up next to the door.  All right.  You better make sure you...  Oh, because the ladies...  Whoa.  Wow.  They're going to try to bust the door down.  To see me.  Young Opie naked.  Ugh.  It's just...  It's awful.  Now it's an all-out war with old Opie.  Fuck him.  Fuck him in the ass.  It's madcap.  All right.  You better make sure you hit the power off on the telephone, 
[03:53:30]  and we're all going to be listening to you, man.  Dude, you are a pal, because I forgot about that.  All right.  You got the stopwatch?  All right.  You tell me when.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God, dude.  Don't start up before I hit this stopwatch.  I've got to tell you what's going on over here.  What?  You know what happens when you, like, go into the ocean when it's, like, 50 degrees?  Yes, I told you.  The pressure is immense.  Dude, there's nothing happening down here.  Well, I don't want to hear about it.  Now you're using up my time. 
[03:54:00]  All right.  All right.  Start the stopwatch.  Ready and...  Wait, wait.  Hit the commercials.  As soon as I'm done, I'll call back, all right?  All right, dude.  All right.  Good luck.  Bye.  See, still producing the show.  Can't be too far from producing the fucking show and being the button pusher.  Hit the commercials.  A lot of dudes on both sides.  A lot of dudes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a dude fest.  It's a dude war.  The more you say dude, the younger you appear on the air.  It's true.  Brother Elmo should make Brother Man t-shirts.  That's a goof.  Brother Man. 
[03:54:30]  We'd sell a couple, I think.  This is a fucking...  What a bevy of dudes.  All right.  We're just about done, guys.  It's horrible radio.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  I hate to do this.  I hate to interrupt in the middle of a song, but I think Opie's done, man.  Let me pick him up over here.  Dude.  Dude.  What's up?  Dude.  Is this you?  Yeah.  You sound winded.  Oh, my...  Dude, I'm not gonna have sex for at least two months, man.  What's the matter?  You chafe?  Oh, my God.  Did you chafe yourself? 
[03:55:00]  My time sucked.  This is not really acting, by the way.  I couldn't get fucking hard, and I was, like, pulling it up and, like, going like this,  trying to get something going.  And I remember, no joke, that I really fucked up my dick for a while.  What did you do?  I couldn't get hard.  You treated, like, corn on the cob?  I don't know.  Is it gay if, like, your buddy's jerking off and you just lick his palm to a wedding?  No.  No, that's not gay.  That's all.  Oh, my God.  Did you chafe yourself?  My time sucked.  It did.  You were at, let's see, 1732. 
[03:55:30]  Ah, I owe you a case of beer, man.  You sound exhausted, man.  Dude, let me tell you what's going on.  All right.  First of all, I had the station on.  Yeah.  And I'm doing the deed.  Right.  And I start getting close, right?  Then I start thinking about all our faithful listeners are listening to the same freaking  song I'm listening to right now.  See, you're getting too deep into it, you nut.  I finally turned off the radio.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you did?  Oh, you did?  Oh, you did?  Oh, you did?  Hold on.  Oh, just.  Hey, Anthony.  Just.  Hold on. 
[03:56:00]  I, what the, what?  I'll tell you what that was.  Oh, come on.  I hope you're incorrigible.  You nut.  You loon.  You crazy guy.  What were you going to say?  You fucking dumb cunt.  I don't know, but you nut, maybe not.  You bat out of hell, you?  Oh, you're a dumb bunny.  Can we hear that again?  You nut.  Oh, Anthony.  Of course.  I hope he's a jack of nipes.  All our faithful listeners are listening to the same freaking song I'm listening to right 
[03:56:30]  now.  See, you're getting too deep into it, you nut.  I finally turned off the radio, dude.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You are huffing and puffing.  Oh, dude.  What the hell are you doing?  Come on.  You know what he was getting out.  I'm walking back down the hall, dude.  Oh, you got the phone?  Okay, good.  You'll be in here any second now.  Oh, my God.  It's the pressure, though, man.  It's unbelievable.  I challenge anybody to do this live on the air.  It's almost impossible.  Because then you start thinking, oh, my God, I might totally choke and I'm not going to 
[03:57:00]  be considered a man.  Yeah, that would have been bad.  I was wondering what the hell was going on.  Oh, my God.  He's huffing about, he's going to come in here.  Let me see him.  Let me get a look at you.  Get over here.  Yeah, let me get a look at you.  Come here, you kooky.  Come here, you nut.  Let me see that cock.  Let me give you a tussle.  You talk like one of the Andrews sisters.  Get over here, you.  Let me get a look at you.  Let me see you, you.  Come here, sailor. 
[03:57:30]  He's a boogie-woogie bugle boy, and he just jerked off and chafed himself.  Let me look at you.  Get over here.  Everyone scooped Damien from Ohio.  You nut, you silly goose.  And then you got Marshall from Texas.  He writes, I love Opie keeps enabling his alcoholism with cases of beer.  I know you wonder why poor ant.  Come in here.  Let me see him.  Let me get a look at you.  Get over here.  Get over here.  Let me see you.  Let me taste that. 
[03:58:00]  Look at him.  He's sweating like a pig.  Holy mackerel.  Oh.  Is that going over here?  Yeah.  At least for once, it's a real fucking moment.  It's not this.  I actually explained something real.  What do you, what?  Here you go.  Get away.  Dude, he just threw a paper towel at me.  Get out of here.  That's just hand lotion in toilet paper, dude.  Oh.  Ah.  Look at that.  Jeez, what a measly sample.  Not bad, Opie. 
[03:58:30]  Let me show you the picture that finally did it for me.  What were you using?  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, jeez.  She's Gumby with cans.  Wow.  Dude.  I am never doing that ever again.  No.  Well, we did it already.  So, how do you feel?  I started panicking.  I'm like, there's no way I could do it.  There's no way.  I started freaking panicking.  Right when you get in there, you're convinced there is no possible way that it's going to happen.  I literally used a half a thing of hair.  Oh, we did it already.  No way. 
[03:59:00]  You're not supposed to do that.  Look at him.  He's huffing and puffing.  You won.  You won the side bet.  I won the side bet.  I had 11, 15.  It took me 11 minutes, 15 seconds to complete giving the sample.  And it took Opie 17 and a half minutes.  Right.  So, you're going to feel a little chafed, I think.  All right.  We'll talk to Don Newton next and we'll take a peek out of the microscope.  Enough about Don Newton.  I want to see what these look like.  Jesus.  What kind of superhero do you think this Don Newton is?  Don Newton character.  Who's this fucking cum-carrying cuntbag you guys are talking about like he's fucking Trump? 
[03:59:30]  Almost 18 minutes of jerking off.  What were you thinking of this bit?  All right.  Finally, the results.  And we put this to bed.  That's right.  Please say Don Newton again.  Dude.  We thought this bit.  I remember this much.  We thought this bit was so terrific.  It was time for the results.  It was a Friday.  Oh, we made everyone wait until Monday to find out who won. 
[04:00:00]  We actually did the old weekend tease.  Yeah.  We thought of that one.  Like, you know, they're going to be all over Boston and bars going.  So, who do you think?  Hey, who do you think won?  A little chatter and discussions about it.  Did you hear that show?  Wow.  Who do you think won?  Boy, I don't know, man.  I'm going to go with Opie.  I'll bet you.  I'll bet you.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  We'll do an office pool bet.  We'll do a case of beer like that.  Yeah, like they do.  Because they're so cool.  Which one of my radio show hosts has thicker loads? 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  That's what they're all thinking.  That's what they're all thinking.  Our 15-year-old male audience.  I'll bet you a white Russian.  All right.  I'll bet you a chowder.  That's right.  We were hoping our listeners would talk about our cum all weekend long.  Yeah.  Great.  So, Monday finally came upon us.  And we only have two minutes left.  No more after this.  Please.  Bear with us.  As everyone knows, on Friday, me and Anthony did the deed.  Yes.  We got a sample. 
[04:01:00]  We got a sample of spermies.  And I bet that we waited until 5.15 because I'm a fucking radio douche.  And I know that's when everybody's in their cars.  Most people are listening.  Yes.  Listening to the fucking show.  Spermies.  Don Newton, he knew the results on Friday, but the bastard made us wait until today, Monday.  And he is here to give us the results to find out.  What?  You blamed it on Don Newton.  Yeah.  That cum-carrying worm would have answered any question you asked him.  He made us wait until Monday for the results. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, because he really wanted to come back another day for this horseshit.  That fucking load-lugging weasel.  And by the way, we taped this on Friday.  Of course.  Did you?  Yeah, because we weren't going to get the guy back.  Yeah, the guy was going to come back in.  So we taped the whole thing.  You guys are, I mean, as the bit before, you guys are pros at acting.  Oh, this is awful.  Not creating situations.  What the hell is this guy's name?  Maybe you'll say it again.  I don't know.  Don Newton, he knew the results on Friday, but the bastard made us wait until today, Monday.  And he is here to give us the results to find out who has won Sperm Bowl 96. 
[04:02:00]  This is it, man.  Now, first of all, I need to know, are we both normal?  We're both normal.  You both have really normal, healthy-looking, beautiful skin.  Ah, there we go.  How are the heads on the little buggers?  They have the right shape, two of them.  They're not too round, not too sharply pointed.  All right.  The tails have got good motility.  They're swimming around.  They swim like Mark Spitz?  Like Mark Spitz.  Okay.  All right.  That's a 1972 Olympics reference.  I'm surprised you didn't say there's not a funny cell in either one of your sperms. 
[04:02:30]  I just used a 24-year-old reference.  What?  How many famous swimmers are there?  Greg Leganis.  Might as well go with the best, right, Jimmy?  Absolutely.  Think about fast swimming.  Whoa, hey.  God damn it.  Who the hell is giving these results?  Please, at one point, just mention who he is.  Okay.  How many lines are you up to?  3,400.  All right.  Mine is swimming around like Johnny Weissmuller. 
[04:03:00]  What are you just swimming around?  They swim like Mark Spitz?  Like Mark Spitz.  Okay.  All right.  I am so freaked out, man.  All right.  Are we both on the upper scale as far as sperm goes?  Pretty good.  Right around up the middle.  Right up the middle.  All right.  We're above average?  I'd say you're both average.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It wasn't that.  All right, Dom.  We are ready.  All right.  Here it is.  I counted them twice, okay?  And then I took the average of each count.  Okay.  So we'll start with Anthony since he kind of went first.  Oh, no.  Anthony has a sperm count of 3,210,000. 
[04:03:30]  Whoa.  That's pretty good.  Not bad.  Not bad.  3 million.  All of them?  And Opie went, of course, second.  And his sperm count would be...  We'll tell you tomorrow.  No, I'm just kidding.  Douchebag.  That is funny.  That would be so funny.  I know.  You just fucking...  You just do it.  Fucking 10-year tease.  And his sperm count would be 2,675,000. 
[04:04:00]  Rock!  Rock!  I am sperm man!  You can say that again.  I've made that into my life, being sperm man.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  I'm yelling at the top of my lungs, I am sperm man.  And I see another t-shirt.  I am sperm man.  A stained one.  I am sperm man! 
[04:04:30]  No!  Rock!  Dun-da-da-da!  I am sperm man!  Captain sperm.  That's it.  Hey, hey.  Wait, what was my account?  I want to thank the Academy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What was my official account?  2,675,000.  You beat me by what?  600,000?  Half a million, dude.  And I wanted you to spot me a half a mil.  I wasn't spotting you.  Wait a minute.  Look at my lifestyle.  I drink.  I smoke.  Look at you.  Everyone said that Italians have a higher sperm count.  That's right.  I want to thank my heritage.  What's in my...  Opie, come on. 
[04:05:00]  Don't be...  You're normal.  You finished second.  Yeah.  Great, I finished second.  You came in second.  Yeah, I came in second.  But not many people would go to work and give me...  What?  Wait, why'd you say I came?  Why'd you stress came?  Because cum and cumming, and if you came, is another way to put when you fucking cum,  when jism spews out of your cock.  Oh, you're nuts.  See, so I was...  Oh, you really are.  I'm just a kook. 
[04:05:30]  You are a dumb bunny.  A kooky guy.  Let me give a little...  Is that the official horn?  Uh, no.  Oh.  See, uh...  C. Murph from Pennsylvania asks, dude, is this Dunsky yet?  We're just about done.  Yeah.  Great.  I finished second.  You came in second.  Yeah, I came in second.  But not many people can go to work and do what you guys did on Friday.  That's right.  I think there are no winners or losers here today.  Everybody wins.  I think everyone wins.  Dude, shut up.  There are winners, and there are losers.  Okay.  Let's just say the losers are the listening audience. 
[04:06:00]  Thanks.  And the winners are the ones with the little doggy.  Dennis from Boston writes, this is the kind of radio that inspired some suit in Washington  to say, update, I need to shoot satellites into space so all of North America can hear  this kind of radio.  I think there are no winners or losers here today.  I think everyone wins.  Dude, shut up.  Shut up.  You don't have to jump into the car and crash into a wall to test an airbag. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, no.  That's right.  You're going to be doing that.  No.  I'm sorry.  What can I say?  We had no say over how the results came out.  All right.  Shake my hand.  No.  You didn't watch it over the weekend?  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  How did he figure that one out?  That was odd.  Just blew it right there that that was the same day. 
[04:07:00]  What's the matter?  You couldn't get Juice Newton to come back in?  Fucking hate Don.  I hope Don Newton is fucking dead wherever he is.  Did we ever go through with the bet conclusion where you had to drive a car into Walt and do  the very bit we fucking ragged on?  Where did these mental blocks come from?  Well, first of all, that bit was just one of those bits everyone was doing.  Yeah.  The fake car crash.  Oh, man. 
[04:07:30]  I don't know if we did it.  I don't remember doing it.  I don't think we did.  I think we just let that one go.  We were on to bigger and better things, I'm sure.  If we could find that, that would be pretty interesting.  I'll never be able to laugh at Garlic Buttersaw.  Not after that.  The Opie Anthony and Don Newton show.  Don Newton.  Fucking, I hope, you know what it was?  I hope he was fucking, it was the day of his daughter's wedding, and a fucking sniper's  bullet caught him with a fucking cum sample in his hand. 
[04:08:00]  And when they crossed his hands in the funeral parlor, his daughter, who got married that  day, and we looked down and sort of fucking dried jizz on his knuckle, and went, ugh.  Before we get to the line of the day.  Don Newton is a bag of shit.  Fuck Don Newton in his mouth.  Fuck him in his mouth with a fucking bat with a dick painted on it.  I despise Don Newton.  I was a half million sperm short because Don Newton swallowed him. 
[04:08:30]  He took a little sip.  Fuck.  Before line of the day, they're getting the results together.  We got this.  Bad credit?  No credit?  No job?  No down payment?  Get the fuck out!  You want a great selection on a new and used car truck or minivan?  Get the fuck out!  You want friendly service?  Service with a smile?  Get the fuck out!  That's right.  Get the fuck out! 
[04:09:00]  The Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, I'd like a new minivan, but I have dick for credit.  Get the fuck out!  When I buy a new car, I expect good service.  Get the fuck out!  Come to Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, did you hear what I said?  Get the fuck out!  Oh, that's right.  By the Fridays.  You get it?  Is that a real commercial?  Yeah, it's a real place, Jimmy.  Uh, Dan C. from Pottstown.  He writes, and 12 years later, the sperm count are the prices of your home. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, shit.  Bobby.  Looks like someone reads the newspaper.  That's awful.  Anyway.  I don't know if that's true.  I do know if it's true or not.  I was just saying that.  Won't say anything.  Yeah, we've got to make believe we're regular working class guys.  Humble and lovable.  Are we tearing down walls today?  Well, Line of the Day is brought to you by SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26th. 
[04:10:00]  SkiColorado!  It's SkiColorado!  For info on great deals on 26th world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute snow conditions.  Conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  SkiColoradoado.com.  SkiColoradoado.com.  You're a nut!  Oh, God.  Good gravy.  I can't wait to hear how many runners out there are. 
[04:10:30]  Well, the guys had 20 to pick from.  Wow.  There's nine runner-ups that they just insist need to be replayed.  And then we got the winner.  Nine runner-ups.  Sorry.  Can we get the winner today, or do we have to wait till now?  All right.  Here we go.  A runner-up line of the day.  Oh, no.  There goes another bit that's starting.  A band of brother-mans.  Now I hear laughter, and I just, I don't like it. 
[04:11:00]  Number two.  No more laughing.  I just read one of the John from Virginia.  Plot tools.  The third runner-up.  Oh, my God.  They didn't, you yelled, what was that?  It must have been a good idea.  Nobody recognized it.  The fourth runner-up.  You're feeling a little woozy.  So many slogans, so little shirt space. 
[04:11:30]  He's just playing the show again.  Jimmy's just running away with it.  The fifth runner-up.  If we die doing this, I'm going to be pissed.  You are.  You're too big idiot.  That's all right, Doug.  The sixth runner-up.  Those little buggers.  People are wondering how old my fiance was when I was doing this hack radio.  She was a little bugger. 
[04:12:00]  The seventh?  I think so.  Seventh runner-up.  Put it on a t-shirt.  Maybe you, we hate.  P-U.  You have to put it on a t-shirt.  P-U.  P-U.  The eighth runner-up.  I can say this is the worst radio I've ever heard.  No, it's not.  Who's worse?  No, the other one you played earlier.  Oh, yeah.  I could hear Voss trying to slip it in there.  Friggin' kidney cyst. 
[04:12:30]  That joke held it down a little long.  Wet chicken.  Nothing.  Wet chicken from Frunkus in New Hampshire, he writes.  You should have played that get the fuck out of your commercial earlier.  You would have saved us a lot of time and pain.  Today's show completely took away any confidence I have.  I have no confidence in anything anymore.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm a bit depressed.  I went into this like, this will be fun, and it's like, it's, I don't know, it's a  little weird.  No, I can't do anything now. 
[04:13:00]  We really thought we were good back then.  Well, you can pick yourselves up off the mat when I bring in the dog shit that I actually  passed off as standoff on national television.  At least you guys only got hurt in one market.  I passed this fucking garbage off in front of the entire country.  I feel sexy.  No.  No, you don't do that.  First of all, when are we doing that?  Tomorrow?  Friday?  I feel.  We'll try for Friday.  Hi.  Hi.  Little fun, wacky, non-threatening character.  And you did like a little guy? 
[04:13:30]  Yeah, just, you know, a little head bobbing.  And you put on a little high voice?  Yeah, I would talk weird.  Oh, I want to fuck you.  I was awful, dude.  I should have fucking grabbed whatever Don Newton was holding and drank it.  Enough about Don Newton.  We got this.  Are we done?  Don Newton.  You must have hated Don Newton.  Ah, Don Newton.  Thank you for inviting me.  On the day of your Don's wedding. 
[04:14:00]  I'm Don R. Newton.  A salute, Don Newton.  Because Don Nul says so.  I'm not coming out of some dead dog dedication.  Don Newton.  Who are you?  I'm Don Newton.  Don Newton.  Steve from Bayshore writes, 
[04:14:30]  Ant, I want that fucking cat back.  He says, you can't take Jack Jack back.  That's weird.  Not many, uh, I'll, I'll pat our, I think we should pat ourselves on our backs, though.  No one, no one is willing to do that shit.  Sure.  It's got to be said.  No.  So fucking awkward.  There's not a lot of people with that shit out there to do.  Ah, fuck you.  Hey, uh, when you said we should pat ourselves on the back, I wanted to say, with a train. 
[04:15:00]  These are just more runner-up lines of the day.  Doing them live.  Oof.  Brutal.  Someone is suggesting that I need, oh, Coke Logic, he writes, after today, Opie should  drop a place in E-Rock's hero list.  Should be third behind Hulk Hogan now.  Here's your final, uh, runner-up line of the day.  This sounds like two retards playing in the park. 
[04:15:30]  I don't know.  You love the Hawkers.  Drop the balloons.  That was a great one.  That was a doosie.  What a show today.  Yeah.  We're just about done ski, uh, here.  SkiColoradoNow.com, thank you.  Here is your line of the day.  Line of the day?  Yeah, I know, man.  This is crazy.

[04:16:30]  Wow.  I gotta say one line.  One line that should have made fucking, uh.  There's so many to choose from, though.  One line that should have made a runner-up, at least.  It was a poetic line.  Was I had so many hooks in the water.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  I had a lot of hooks in the water, man.  It was just so fucking open.  It conjured up an image.  Dude, I tore down a lot of walls, man.  I'm not even gonna joke.  I was hoping to get a fucking catchphrase going, and I figured the only way to do it 
[04:17:00]  was to throw a bunch of them out there and see which one.  Keep just pounding them.  What a hit.  A lot of walls.  You look like a guy in every fucking 80s movie sitting on the toilet after the house  is blown up.  Fucking.  Has to be an 80s movie.  That's what makes us so good.  All right, guys.  So the plugs go as follows.  Bob Kelly's going up to...  Comedy Connection, Rhode Island tonight.  And Comedy Connection, Kaloons and Saugus, Thursday night.

It's coming on February 15th?  Yeah.  Cool.  Fast Freddy from Jericho Station.  He says it all.  Jesus Christ.  Don't ever do that.  What do you do?  Bonnie stretched. 
[04:18:30]  And there's something under that shirt.  It's my stomach.  I don't know what it is.  Was that a stomach?  It's my stomach.  That's where they filmed the movie, under that t-shirt.  That really was some look.  Yeah.  Because it's the gut.  But then you got, like, your hip.  Your hips were sticking out, and your gut goes right between them.  Like, you don't have...  Your fatness doesn't go to your hips.  Leave Dolph's sweet body alone.  Dolph's sweet.  Yeah, that's who it looks like.  Hey, tomorrow we're doing cherry darts on the program.  Let's just shirt up. 
[04:19:00]  Cherry darts tomorrow.  Fuck that belly button.  Lift up, lift up.  Look at his guy fucking horny.  Look at his underwear all hanging down.  I'm like every construction worker.  Can you just say this?  Let me say something about my underwear.  Can you just say this, Bob?  But these are the jewels from the belt.  My underwear, the elastic on my underwear, says fuck it every morning.  Get away from my tits, Jake!  I swear to God.  Why don't you put the dishes where they won't fall?  I'm fucking ruining a championship belt with a fucking hammer next to stacked dishes. 
[04:19:30]  How do you not love LaMotta?  Oh.  Oh.  Sorry.  We end with this.  Fast Freddy writes, awesome show, brother man.  Crack yourself an Opweiser, brewski dudes.  Crank 2-0, you bros.  Bro, dude.  There's going to be a lot of new names on the message board.  Yeah.  A lot of new names out there.  Good luck trying to figure out what to animate today.  All right.  Any catchphrase attempts you want to throw out there? 
[04:20:00]  For the most part, I got...  I left that behind.  For the most part.  Yeah.  Linger longer, you know.  There's still...  Well, that's, you know...  Brings me back a little bit.  Some of these things do end up on your brother's shirts.  I mean...  Whipping my Wednesday was...  You know, that's a good one for us.  All right.  Let's...  Hummer Tuesday.  Let's just end this day.  Hopefully...  We got a busy show tomorrow, by the way.  Wake up tomorrow and forget how depressed we were.  I won't mention it at all. 
[04:20:30]  I hope not, too.  I would like everyone to forget.  Forgotten.  All right.  Forget what?  Everyone do that Men in Black thing tonight, please.  Absolutely.  I'm never going to remember the show.  Cherry Darts tomorrow.  Sandy Kane tomorrow.  Yeah!  Woo!  Russell.  Darts.  Darts.  The official darts.  The official cherries.  Know what we also learned today?  That Howard Stern was full of shit.  Because, thank you, people are reminding me that Howie thought we were ripping him off. 
[04:21:00]  He wants to, like...  Well...  Take credit for that?  Take credit for that load of shit.  All right.  There you go, Howie.  Russell Peters.  What is...  Who is he, Jimmy?  He's one of the biggest comics in the world, Russell.  He's...  Dan Cook of India.  But he's an Indian comedian.  And he fucking sells out literally all over the world.  You're saying he's really the biggest comic in the world?  He's one of them.  He's one of the biggest...  Yeah, he's awesome.  He's a good guy, too.  Really funny guy.  He sells...  Why don't we know him in the States?  Because the States...  He sells, like...  He has a tremendous Asian, Indian audience.  Like, he'll sell out 5,000 cedars in the States. 
[04:21:30]  Yeah.  And most people have never heard of Russell Peters.  Huh.  It's like, Dane has mainstream fame, but Russell has fame...  Throughout the world.  Everywhere.  Yeah.  He has Dane fame in Canada and a lot of other places.  So his humor doesn't translate to America?  No, it doesn't.  It does, yeah.  No, it does.  He's just one of those guys that just got famous in other countries before he came here.  Now he's getting famous here.  He's a good guy.  His audience is all fucking web-savvy.  I get how that fan went, because all the Asians...  So he talks a lot about Asians in his act. 
[04:22:00]  So they just love him, man.  All right.  And we got Adam Farrar from Rescue Me.  And Don Newton.  Don Newton.  That's right.  That douche.  And JBL.  Hilarious.  He's back in the WWE.  He's really, really good with stocks.  Extremely good.  But he's pushing another character that gives you boners or something.  Oh, my God.  He's wrestling and he's doing stocks.  Dressed like a kid?  JBL.  He should be a good guest tomorrow.  Oh, look.  It's Oliver from the Brady Bunch with a new character. 
[04:22:30]  Dude.  And we got to wait for what?  Super Agent Bob Eatman and Eric Logan?  Apparently so.  They're in an office somewhere.  They're going to give us an update.  That's all I know.  And that's the truth.  That's not some...  Whatever.  Anyway.  All right, guys.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production.  Hi, I'm Steve C. 
[04:23:00]  The Beating Heart of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Obviously, my voice is good for more than convincing children that I'm good friends with their parents.  I also volunteer my services as a part-time hostage negotiator.  Steve, it's an emergency and you're the only one who can bring these hostages back alive.  Why me?  What's the catch?  You might be responsible for the kidnapping.  You mean it can't be?  You will never catch me alive, coppers.  I am the unstoppable crime burglar.  I will blow away everyone in this room. 
[04:23:30]  Dr. Crime Burglar, this is Steve C.  Let those children go.  Please, don't rape them.  He never said anything about rape.  I don't trust you, Steve C.  You never sent me my wow sticker.  Well, you must not have sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  10019.  It was your own fault.  Now let the kids out alive.  I did all that.  Well, were you one of those assholes that just sent an empty envelope with no self-addressed stamped envelope inside? 
[04:24:00]  Sir, we have a clean shot.  Should we take it?  Yeah, shoot that bastard in the face.  You're safe now, kids.  Let's go home.  Everyone, get in the van.  But Mr. Steve, where's our parents?  They're all dead. 
[04:24:30]  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're all dead.  They're dead.  They're dead.  They're dead.  They're dead. </pre>
