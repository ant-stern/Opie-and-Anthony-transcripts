<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from WYSP's Philadelphia studios was a chaotic and sexually charged affair, heavily centered around the impending 5 PM announcement on Kid Chris's show regarding a potential format change back to rock music.  The show, featuring frequent guest Jim Norton in studio at various points,  was rife with speculation about staff firings, including the Barski show, and reminiscing about the hosts' own past firings and the often-destructive retrieval of their hard drives from previous stations like WNEW.  They extensively mocked a disliked L.A. talk show duo, John and Jeff,  and the flimsy "WYSP Talks" banner.  The upcoming Camden, New Jersey stop on their "ONA Travel Virus Comedy Tour" was also discussed.

The broadcast included several in-studio guests.  One was Michaela, a transsexual individual, whose interview with the hosts was characterized by insensitive and sexually suggestive questioning focusing on their surgeries and physical attributes, culminating in Michaela showing the hosts their genitals.  The hosts also had a studio guest Mike from FMQB.com discussing the leaked impending staff changes at WYSP. Another guest was a foot fetish enthusiast who, after a comedically contrived hurdle involving the less attractive feet of Shimmy (also Michaela), wanted to kiss a female intern’s feet.  This led to a segment involving crude humor, descriptions of bodily functions, and the eventual display of her breasts by intern Sarah after encouragement from the hosts and a promise of no photos being taken.  Sarah’s personal life was also discussed extensively.

The show received numerous calls, with listeners sharing personal anecdotes ranging from a suicide attempt to a severe ear infection requiring brain surgery. One caller's previous attendance at a show with a freeze-dried monkey was also recounted.  The hosts debated the merits of sending a provocatively dressed, possibly overweight, woman onto a Southwest Airlines flight to cause a scene, a discussion stemming from an earlier conversation about a woman removed from a Southwest flight for inappropriate attire.  This segued into a lengthy, sexually charged discussion about past workplace behavior, including "ass pinching."  A purported leaked Britney Spears phone call was deemed fake.  A pre-show discussion criticized producer Steve’s confrontational approach to interviewing someone who created a viral video possibly related to Britney Spears.

A significant portion of the show involved a spontaneous street parade in Philadelphia, largely improvised due to technical difficulties described as a “klaxon” and “bad radio alert.”  Kenny, a crew member, was sent out to interact with passersby, often with awkward and sexually suggestive encounters.  This parade, interrupted by commercial breaks featuring unspecified activities by the hosts, included interactions with various women, including Ruth, who had just finished a KYW interview.  The street parade also involved Jim Norton calling in, Club Soda Kenny interrupting with lewd comments, and the use of instruments like a harmonica and tambourine.  The parade segment was further complicated by continuing technical issues with the remote microphone and nearby construction noise.  The hosts repeatedly teased the 5 PM WYSP announcement without revealing its content.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts frequently promoted a live show at the TLA on South Street and a comedy show at the Tweeter Center, interspersed with numerous sexually suggestive comments, crude jokes, and offensive remarks.  The show concluded with a rushed wrap-up expressing concern about potential career-ending consequences for their on-air behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like, you're the I-man, I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up  that he's very, very depressed 
[00:01:00]  because his refrigerator door fell off.  It made a break for him.  Obi and Anthony.  Stupid Australians  whose national hero got killed  by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Something dramatic is about to happen. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah?  That's what I think when I hear this music.  Uh, oh, yeah?  It's the Obi and Anthony show.  That's what you're getting.  Good morning.  And the Obi and Anthony show live from Philadelphia, PA. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, we're in the, uh,  the beautiful studios of WYSP.  The 94 WYSP Talks Studio.  Right.  Kenny got to put up some paper  on the grill  and I'm wearing a sweatshirt.  It's freezing in here.  You're wearing a 94 WYSP.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  The Rock Station sweatshirt.  What?  What happened?  It must be an old one.  What's our phone number?  Brand new.  I forgot our phone number  because we're on the road.  877-212-ON-DA.  Is it really?  877-212-ON-DA.  Very good.  Jim Norton in studio as well.  Of course.  Well, uh,  we're down here in Philly  because Saturday  is the last stop  on the ONA Travel Virus Comedy Tour. 
[00:03:00]  Yes, in Camden.  In Camden,  across the river there.  Uh,  eight or nine comedians  you know and love from the show  and the ONA Village  and, uh,  you know the deal by now.  Tickets are going really,  really well.  Uh,  Virus Tour.  Would you say,  are they up to hot cake level?  Uh,  not yet.  No?  Uh,  maybe a hot blueberry muffin.  So they're going like  hot blueberry muffins.  Not like hot cakes.  But that's why we're here.  The big show's Saturday  and then we,  we, uh,  put the tour to rest  and, uh,  I think we come off the road 
[00:03:30]  for a while.  Thank Christ.  But we liked visiting  all the cities this summer.  Please don't get me wrong.  I love visiting the cities,  but please,  can I just stay home  for a little while?  I'm with you with,  thank God.  But, uh,  you know,  enough is enough.  We gotta,  I wanna see the place I bought.  Wouldn't that be nice?  I,  I remember you,  when you bought your house  and I was still in my crappy apartment.  You used to come into work and go,  man,  I would love to see my house,  but we're on the road.  Every weekend there's something going on. 
[00:04:00]  I can't wait to actually see the apartment  that I bought.  Our own, uh,  Keith,  the cop,  and, uh,  Danny,  um,  were in my house yesterday  picking me up  and we all drove down here  and, um,  in the,  on the floor,  the second you walk  in my front door,  are two giant bags  from vacation  opened up with clothes  kind of strewn about.  Mm-hmm.  I can't even, like,  yeah,  enjoy where I live 
[00:04:30]  or unpack stuff  or,  or anything.  So you're looking at me  like I'm supposed to be shocked.  No.  For this trip to Philly,  uh,  my suitcase  was right next to the front door.  I just went through it real fast.  Oh,  this is dirty underwear,  dirty socks.  Oh,  this is a dirty shirt.  The rest of it was clean.  Add a couple things to it.  Just replace some of your,  uh,  vacation stuff  and other tour stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah,  that's it.  Throw some new clothes in.  Some new undies.  So,  but, uh,  the virus show Saturday  is going to be, uh,  Yeah,  very psyched.  It's going to be huge, man. 
[00:05:00]  We can't wait.  We can't wait to end it  here in Philly.  Yeah.  Philly's like our second home  at this point.  Of course.  We've been down here  so many times.  And there's another reason,  uh,  we decided to come down here.  Oh, yeah?  Well,  we were,  you know,  we're,  I don't know,  I don't understand  what you're talking about.  There's another reason  why we're down here.  What?  Ah,  we're helping them out  with something.  You know.  Um,  I hope it's not heavy lifting  or anything.  I just don't, 
[00:05:30]  I don't like that.  I don't want to help  someone move  or anything.  Well,  you know,  there's going to be  a big announcement  down here in Philly.  Is there?  At five o'clock  on the Kid Chris show.  Whoa.  For everybody, uh,  listening on WISP.  I certainly wish  I knew about this.  Well,  it was one of the reasons  why we decided  to come down  a bit early.  We were only going to do  like one day  before the comedy show,  but, uh,  you know,  we're in on this thing  that is going to happen  today at five o'clock  that we're not supposed  to talk about. 
[00:06:00]  Even though you're wearing  a 94 WISP  The Rock Station sweatshirt.  Well,  it could be old.  Huh?  This could be one  of the older shirts.  It's a classic.  It smells brand new.  It better be.  They brought me three of them.  One of them had a yellow  stain on it.  It could have been  snot or worse.  I'm thinking  or worse.  Yeah.  And, uh,  I wanted a new one.  Yeah.  And then,  so this one's new.  And then you got  the front page  of the Philadelphia  Daily News, 
[00:06:30]  the People paper,  says WISP  brings back rock,  but we gotta ignore  that until five o'clock  because we really  Ixnay on the ock ray.  Because we really  don't know what's going on.  It's on the front page  of the paper  and they're like,  you know,  can you just help us out  and promote that.  We got a big announcement  at five o'clock today.  That's all.  Yeah.  We'll help you out.  We won't announce anything.  We show up here at YSP.  They're still wearing  the, uh,  94 WISP Talks 
[00:07:00]  t-shirts.  The official 94 WISP  Talks t-shirts.  The banner's right behind you.  The big one.  Well, let's be honest.  We're here in the YSP studio  and what Anthony  is pointing at  is a very flimsy banner.  They never,  I don't think they really  ever believed in the talk thing  because they're like,  you wrap fish in that?  Because they never even  put it in a frame.  No, it's just flapping  in the air conditioning  hurricane that's going on  in the studio.  Like someone around here  knew and they're like,  ah, it's just a matter of time.  Why, why get it framed? 
[00:07:30]  Why bother?  Why bother getting it framed?  I like the fact  that if they kept it  very basic though,  YSP Talks.  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you?  It talks.  And if the rumor's true,  they want us to go on  Kid Chris today  down here in Philly  and talk with Kid Chris  for about 20 to 30 minutes  about how The Rock  might be back here  in Philadelphia.  Seems a little odd.  Talking about how The Rock's back.  Right.  We'll do a little talk show  about how The Rock's back. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  We could be playing  some really cool rock  right now,  but we have to talk about  the fact that Rock  is coming back.  If indeed it is.  We don't know.  I don't know.  With these papers,  it could be all rumor.  Rumor and speculation.  It's everywhere.  Of course it is.  Radio secrets  are the worst kept secrets  ever, ever.  Right.  Ever.  Unless, of course,  you're in New York  and you have a John Minnelli  as a program director  and that dolt 
[00:08:30]  doesn't know it's happening,  so he starts crying  and writing bad things  about you on message boards.  And calls your show  and says, you know,  awful things to you.  Yes.  Where the day before  he was all cool  and shaking your hand.  I hate radio.  I hate radio people.  I hate the secrets  and this stupid business angle.  You know what I like?  Coming in and joking.  And having a few laughs  with your friends.  Yeah, just telling a few jokes.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, we did it in New York 
[00:09:00]  and John Minnelli  had no idea, I guess.  Yeah.  Even though the brand new van  was painted  and outside the station  and people were walking around  with, you know,  The Rock is back  and t-shirts,  but he had no idea.  He had no clue.  As the program director,  he had no clue.  He was working on  bringing Bob Grant back,  I think,  to the station.  85-year-old talker  Bob Grant  was coming back.  He is a legend.  Of course,  the old curmudgeon.  I love the guy,  but Jesus Christ.  All right, 
[00:09:30]  so we're going to ignore  the whole...  So who's the poor douches here?  That what?  I don't know.  Every station's got poor douches  when they do things  at stations.  Well,  they're saying in the paper today  down here in Philly  that...  People are saying?  That a lot of guys  got fired yesterday, so...  Did they?  God,  that's another thing about radio.  A lot of good guys  get tossed out the door.  A lot of talented guys.  Yeah.  Really talented guys.  The whole Barski show 
[00:10:00]  was let go  down here in Philly.  They're very talented guys.  I thought you meant  John and Jeff.  John and Jeff could go...  We finally got to listen  to a little more of them  this morning  on the drive-in.  I go,  Opie,  it's John and Jeff.  Is this a little too inside  for people, though?  I know.  I don't know.  We were talking about them  months ago.  If you're a faithful listener  to the show,  we've been talking about  John and Jeff off and on  for the last year,  year and a half.  Yeah.  They're god-awful.  They're a talk show  out of L.A.  We can't stand them.  We can't tell  if they're gay or pedophiles. 
[00:10:30]  I think they might be both  depending on  how you look at it.  My personal opinion  because I don't know  what the guy's lifestyle is,  but if you take trips  to Thailand...  Right.  There's only two reasons  to go to Thailand.  To bring back  huge amounts  of illegal drugs  or to have sex  with young boys.  And I don't think  he was bringing back drugs.  They just don't sound manly.  Yeah.  And they're supposed  to be talking to men.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's like the whole demo. 
[00:11:00]  They're supposed to get in there  and talk to the men  about manly things  like picking up  young Indonesian boys.  Well, the last  we left you  with John and Jeff  in New York,  they got rid  of the talk station,  the talk format,  brought back rock and roll.  And finally,  we got to say goodbye  to John and Jeff.  Yeah.  Because we were the staffs  that had to listen  to them every morning  because we're the ones  getting up effing early  hanging out at the station  and the John and Jeff show  is cranking  from every speaker.  You can't even go  to the bathroom  without listening  to John and Jeff. 
[00:11:30]  Apparently you could.  They actually,  for some reason,  I think it was  the timber  in their voice  actually reacted  with Opie's bowels.  And when he heard  John and Jeff,  he had to run  into the bathroom  and actually  go to the bathroom.  I was never more regular  in my life.  So we thought  we were done  with John and Jeff  and YSP sent  a nice limo  for us  to pick us up  this morning.  Thank you.  And the first thing  we hear 
[00:12:00]  is effing  John and Jeff  in the limo.  Yeah.  John and Jeff  in the limo.  But rumor has it  that might be  the last we hear of them.  If the rumor's true,  YSP cleans house  to rock.  I don't know  if this is true.  Where are you reading that?  On some blog?  Yeah, it's blog.  It's got to be  some guy's blog  that heard a rumor  from somebody.  A blog.  Do you have a blog, Jim?  No, I despise blogs.  I hate bloggers.  Goddamn, 
[00:12:30]  if my daughter  ever brought home  a blogger.  I'll tell you this.  Oh, sorry.  No, I don't have a daughter.  But I sure hate  the bloggers.  Don't raise  a blogger lover.  Yeah, well,  somebody at YSP  sleeps with  this guy, Dan Gross.  I'll tell you that much  because this was  supposed to be a secret  and he broke the news  like three days ago  in the Philadelphia paper.  Now, this morning  you wake up here  in Philly with this.  Dan Gross, 
[00:13:00]  YSP cleans house  to rock again.  It happened earlier  than expected,  but 94WYSP  has flipped formats  and will return  to a mix of rock  and talk.  We report exclusively  Tuesday the station  planned to do so.  It will begin  using the slogan  The Rock is Back  as early as today.  It has been two years  since the station  aired music on weekdays.  YSP fired most of  its on-air staff  yesterday after  the Barski show.  Co-host Kim Douglas  was fired,  but Paul Barski  was retained  for an off-air job. 
[00:13:30]  Those guys were  really, really good  broadcasters,  very cool guys.  They were always  nice to us.  Co-host Vinny the Crumb  will continue hosting  the YSP Eagles  pregame shows.  Matt and Huggy,  those guys were  always cool to us  over the years.  Always great guys, man.  We've known them  for almost 10 years  at this point.  Yeah.  Who were music DJs  on the station  before they hosted  a talk show  have been fired  as were Scotty and Alex.  Scotty and Alex?  Did you know them?  Another really good  talk show.  Two younger guys  that are doing  really well.  I didn't know 
[00:14:00]  those guys.  I actually were  entertained by them  the last time  we came down to Philly  we came at night  and I was listening  to Scotty and Alex.  They're pretty good, man.  That's when Twitchels  would go on.  Yeah.  And Kid Chris remains  in the afternoon  drive slot  although his producer  Brad Mabee  and crew member  Monkey Boy  have been let go.  That's not good.  If you're going to  keep Kid Chris  you've got to keep  his guys.  You've got to keep  his guys.  How do you get rid  of Monkey Boy?  How do you get rid  of Monkey Boy?  How do you sit down  Monkey Boy  and tell him he's fired?  Monkey Boy  you better sit down 
[00:14:30]  I've got some awful  news for you.  Opie and Anthony  Heard here on YSP  and XM Satellite Radio  will broadcast their  morning show  from the Old City  Studio tomorrow  and from the Fillmore  at the TLA Friday.  Yeah, the big live  broadcast tomorrow  at the TLA.  What?  Is that what we're doing?  Yeah.  I have no clue.  ONA presenter  Trailing Virus  Comedy Tour  at the Tweeter Center  on Saturday.  So there you go.  It's in the paper.  I don't know.  But the big announcement  will be at 5 o'clock  today with Kid Chris.  Yeah, so shh.  And so yeah,  keep it under your hat.  Yeah, everybody  that was just told that. 
[00:15:00]  Shh.  Yeah, everyone  can you keep a secret?  Keep it on the DL.  Keep it, yeah.  Keep it between us, okay?  If that's true,  wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  You don't know.  It's very exciting  for Philadelphia.  They're spreading rumors.  For Philly to,  you know,  I always thought  YSP should have remained,  you know,  a rock station  for the most part.  Yeah.  And I'm glad  they're finally  doing the right thing  and bringing it back  if it's true.  We like that  whole rock thing.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  We fit better  on rock stations.  For some reason.  I don't know,  YSP talks  just kind of grabs you.  Yeah, look at the flimsy  Speaking of grabs.  Look at the flimsy banner.  They're waiting outside  the studio door  to rip that thing down.  They'll have to  just put a fan on it  to watch it blow away.  I know,  but one of these,  it's hurricane velocity  coming out of that.  There's a vent blowing  on Anthony  and he's freezing  so Kenny fixes it  by hanging two pieces  of loose leaf  and taking the top  which does nothing  but directs it  more efficiently  onto Anthony. 
[00:16:00]  It's exactly it.  Oh, thank God  for this YSP.  The rock station.  The rock station sweatshirt  that must have been  printed up  on a rumor.  Yeah, well,  where are the vans hiding?  You know,  the vans are hiding  somewhere.  You think they're going  to come rolling out  with a shiny paint job?  The new wrap on it.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  A lot of people  are very excited  around here  and then I  are walking  through the halls  going,  ah,  seen it, 
[00:16:30]  done it,  been there many times.  Old veterans  of this crap,  aren't we?  Well, sure.  I remember the time  I was in Buffalo  and the station  was being taken over  by new owners.  That's what it was.  I was trying to remember  what the deal was.  New owners are even worse  than a regular format change.  And we get a memo  on like a Thursday  or a Friday  like we're going  to have a big meeting  in the conference room  on Monday.  And we heard the rumors  that it was being taken over  so we're thinking  we're finally going  to have money  for promotions  and money  to do cool things. 
[00:17:00]  Dummies.  They're finally going  to get us the new van  and maybe we all  get raises.  It's going to be great.  So all weekend  we're partying  all over Buffalo  and playing volleyball,  beach volleyball  back in the day.  All excited.  Can't wait for the meeting  on Monday, right?  So the meeting  happens on Monday.  We're all in a conference room.  They close the door  and pretty much lock it.  The owner's there  to announce  that he has sold  the station  to whoever it was.  I don't even remember anymore.  And that everyone  in the room  except for five people  are fired. 
[00:17:30]  You're fired.  And then  they open the doors  and everyone went back  to their offices  to try to get their stuff  and they had armed guards  at all the computers.  Damn!  You've just been pwned.  That's what they said.  Armed guards  at all the computers  because the new owners  wanted all the info  that were in these computers.  Yeah.  There's something  about those computers, man.  These radio stations  love taking your computers.  And I was  fresh out of college 
[00:18:00]  and didn't have much money,  wasn't making much money,  so I went right  for the prize closet.  Oh, yeah?  I was hauling boxes  of stuff out  into my Honda Accord hatchback.  There's something,  I think it has to do  with people  maybe getting upset  and threatening lawsuits  or something  when a station  does something  and people let go  or whatever the situation is.  They want your computer.  And I think it's  so they could go,  do you really want 
[00:18:30]  to go to court?  Right.  We had a forensics guy  look through your computer  and if you want,  let me tell you,  if you want to go to court,  you feel free,  but oof!  Maybe you ought  to take a look  at this.  Okay,  I'll give you money,  please.  Is that why  you grabbed the hard drive  and ran down 57th Street  as fast as I've ever  seen you run?  I did not.  When we got fired  from WNEW,  I knew not  what was on my hard drive. 
[00:19:00]  That is why  I grabbed it  and took it.  We used to get,  we used to download stuff  constantly in that office  and I knew probably  some,  you know,  bestiality was not  good to have on there.  So,  that had a go.  That had a go.  When we,  when we found out  we got fired,  they allowed us to,  well,  they didn't allow us,  I guess.  We snuck back into  the NEW studios  as CNN's reporting  on our firing  to clear out our office  and get whatever we could  and Ant left everything. 
[00:19:30]  The only thing he grabbed  was the hard drive  and just ran out  of the building.  He goes,  I'll talk to you soon.  I'm like,  where are you going?  Oh,  I gotta bury this.  I opened up that computer,  ripped the hard drive out  and then just kind of  went to the subway  and threw it on the third rail.  That was pretty much it.  Did they ask for it?  Yeah,  they did.  As a matter of fact,  they wanted all the computers  and I said,  that was my personal computer  I had brought from home  because they never gave me 
[00:20:00]  a computer over there  and I was gaming  and I needed a good system.  Well,  you were show prepping.  Yeah,  show prepping was gaming.  Which was gaming.  I talked a lot about games  so I had a game  and yeah,  so I ripped the hard drive out  and that was that  and then they wanted it back  because they wanted  all the emails  that had been going  back and forth  about the Sex for Sam thing  that got us fired.  But I said,  there's no emails on here.  What do you think?  I use this for business?  This was purely pleasure 
[00:20:30]  and you could tell  by the keyboard  you could barely  work the G and H.  But you left  some great stuff behind.  Oh,  I did.  I know.  That's all you wanted.  I left the crippled Barbie doll,  the crippled naked Barbie doll.  A lot of fun stuff  that they gave us.  All right,  well here we are.  Got to reach Sergeant Hartman doll.  Yeah.  Oh,  remember that?  I still have it.  Yeah?  Yeah,  he's sitting cross-legged  on my stupid bookcase.  You should make him sit  with his legs akimbo.  I can't,  he'll tip over. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  All right,  here we are live in Philly  at the WISP Studios.  Something exciting  is happening  at this station today.  We don't know what it is.  Boy,  we don't know.  Oh,  look who's filing in.  Who?  Well,  I'm looking at the TV  unless that's a tape  of last time we were here.  Imagine if they did that  just to F with us.  There you go.  We got fans showing up here  at YSP.  Very cool.  We got the ONA Cafe today. 
[00:21:30]  I'll tell you what's not here.  The vagina.  We got one in the middle there.  Is there any?  You sure?  I see one in the middle.  Wow.  Hello,  Miss Popular.  There she is.  Is that it?  Yeah.  So,  hey guys.  Sanjaya in the back?  Hey guys.  Or is that a chick?  Where?  Where?  Oh,  to the right?  Wow,  that does look like Sanjaya.  Hey guys,  something very exciting  is happening at YSP today.  Ah,  look at the guys.  They can't hear us.  Oh,  they can't hear us yet? 
[00:22:00]  All right,  they can't hear us yet.  I want to see you.  Good.  I want to comment on that guy  sitting in the middle.  The slouch.  We'll talk to those guys  after the break.  How's that?  We're just getting started.  We're live here in Philly  today and tomorrow.  Don't forget tomorrow  at the TLA on South Street  for everybody in the area.  We're going to open the doors  at like 5 in the morning.  We're hoping to really  pack the place  and celebrate  whatever this announcement is today  at 5 o'clock  with Kid Chris.  Indeed.  And of course,  the Virus Show on Saturday,  the last one of the tour. 
[00:22:30]  And we can't wait to do that.  Yep.  Obviously,  tickets still available  through Ticketmaster.  What?  Oh,  Kenny.  I don't know how to turn that on.  Kenny.  All right,  try that one.  Tomorrow,  free admission 21 and over.  What?  At the TLA,  our big live show.  Oh, okay.  So you're supposed to say that.  I think the people out there  figured that much out.  It wasn't like we were going to like  charge people  to see this crap.  That'd be good.  Kenny,  where's your money?  Let me tell you,  I would pay 
[00:23:00]  to view this greatness.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  live from Philly.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  live from WISP Studios  in Philadelphia.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony Show.  Live from the WISP Studio.  Kind of watching the sun  come up over the bridge here.  That's really cool, man.  Yeah.  We don't get to see that  in New York. 
[00:23:30]  Well,  we get to see  a fat,  hairy,  naked woman.  Oh, yeah.  So it's kind of a trade-off.  Kind of.  She actually kind of looks  like Ben Franklin.  So that,  it's kind of a tie-in.  You get to see  the bridge here.  You notice that girl  is getting fatter, too?  Yeah.  She bikes every day  and exercises.  She's on the exercise bike  every day,  but she continues  to gain weight.  I don't get it.  A little fatter.  I don't understand  what's going on with her.  It's the woman we watch  every morning in New York. 
[00:24:00]  We're voyeurs  and there's a building  right there.  And she's a voyeur,  obviously,  because she loves  Exhibitionist.  Yeah, she's an exhibitionist  because she loves  being naked  with the shades  completely up.  She's getting a little wide  and it looks like  she's wearing panties  all the time,  even when she's not.  It's a little...  All right.  Yee.  Hey, they're laughing.  That's a good sign.  What's up, guys?  There they are.  Hi, Jimmy. 
[00:24:30]  Hi, fella.  It's the room.  It's the room.  YSP set up  room for the fans  to kind of hang  and watch us  on a closed-circuit TV  like they're watching  an old Ali Frazier fight  for some reason.  Well, tomorrow  we'll be right  in front of the fans  when we do the big show  at the TLA  on South Street.  What's the...  How do people choose  where they want to sit?  Like the guy  sitting in front,  front and center.  What the hell 
[00:25:00]  would you do that for?  You want to be abused.  Oh, you want to be abused.  Yeah, it's like people  that sit in front  of comedy clubs.  I want to be a front.  You want to be  the ass that heckles.  How many girls we got?  We got like three,  I think, right?  There's one.  There's...  Yeah, two or three, right?  Who's that person  in the back in the orange  with that black hair?  Yeah, who are you?  Are you a girl?  Are you a girl?  Hey, it's Joe Dirt.  All right, he's 
[00:25:30]  coming right up.  Uh, male.  That's, uh...  You're male?  Yes.  Okay.  Wow.  Sorry.  You got an interesting  do there.  It's kind of like  a long football helmet.  I had it before  that Sanjaya faggot,  so please don't compare  me to him.  We're not.  It's kind of like  the Ramones.  Yeah, we're even  going back further  than that.  As far back as you 
[00:26:00]  want to go.  Like 1976.  All right, sit down,  Rod Stewart.  Yeah.  He looks like  Ronnie DeFeo  after he killed  his family in Amityville.  Oh, that's a nice  local reference  for Long Island  there, Jimmy.  Hey, you guys,  there's something  really exciting  happening at YSB.  Do you know?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's rumors  that it might turn  into a rock station again.  I don't know.  Really?  We'll find out  at 5 o'clock today.  One of the reasons  why we came down  here early 
[00:26:30]  to help YSP  with their big announcement  that we're doing  on the Kid Chris show.  And then they get  like a guy  in blue shirt.  Why aren't you  at work  or getting ready for it?  You look like  a guy that  probably works  in an office.  My boss is a huge  O&A fan.  He sent me here.  Oh, did he?  He did.  If he's a huge fan,  why isn't he here?  Because he didn't get picked.  Someone got picked?  Yeah, I got a call yesterday.  They're like,  hey, come to the studio.  I'm like, okay, sure.  Wait, wait.  What do you mean  people got picked? 
[00:27:00]  Well, here's the problem.  Radio's getting  way too organized.  When we used to come  to Philly,  it was an all-out  freaking what?  It was insane.  Remember all the people  that would show up  right outside the studio  on the sidewalk?  They were called  random people, yeah.  Now you have to go  to a website.  Ew.  And then they pick names  because they only want,  what, how many seats  are in there?  Like 40 seats  or something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, back in the day  we would have  hundreds show up.  I think because...  It was organized chaos,  but now it has to be 
[00:27:30]  completely organized.  Because they're afraid  that the building...  Right, right.  The building...  Buildings get angry  these days.  And you don't know  who it is.  It's not like a person  because then you can't  go and talk to the person  because the person  isn't mad.  The building is mad.  You always hear like,  uh-oh, you know,  the building is going  to be upset.  Right.  Oh, Kenny, yes?  Oh, God, I got to turn...  Go ahead.  You should see  all the security guards.  It's like lockdown  out there with the O&A cafe  to get through the screening  and then, you know...  Jesus. 
[00:28:00]  There was a guy  with a freeze-dried monkey  once.  Yeah.  I remember that guy.  I miss the old days  where they would just show up.  Yeah.  I remember the mom  with the baby carriage  and she just handed over  her, like,  to somebody else  so she could take care  of a listener.  Started giving treats  to a listener.  We miss those days.  Now they're all sitting  organized.  Even the chairs are organized.  You know what's really scary,  though,  if that's the case?  Then these guys  are the cream of the crop? 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  Yeah, they could pick whoever  and then...  No offense to the guys,  but they picked you guys?  None at all.  Where's the hot chicks?  Do we have one hot chick?  Yeah, where is she?  We can't see you that well  on these monitors.  It's kind of blurry.  Yeah, the monitor's blurry.  Oh, wow.  What about that one  in the foreground?  Wait, Danny is not gonna...  Nice ass.  Oh, that's Danny.  We had Danny yesterday  pulling out of my driveway.  Keith is driving.  And when you put  my lovely vehicle in reverse, 
[00:29:00]  the rear camera comes on  so you can see  where the hell  you're backing up.  So Keith starts laughing  and insists that Danny...  He goes,  Danny, could you just  pull your pants down  and stick it right  into the camera?  He wanted to see...  I'm not talking underwear either.  I'm talking just  bare...  Camera lens  to camera lens,  if you will.  Of course.  Underwear is for beginners.  Yeah.  And put it right  against the camera  and see what it looked like. 
[00:29:30]  It looks like  when you're pulling  out of the Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah, it didn't sound very...  Hold on, Keith.  Cool.  I'm still trying  to figure out the mics.  What?  He made it sound  a little gay.  Yeah.  I mean, you know...  Yeah, he didn't...  No, see, I don't...  He didn't want to  really go for it.  I think it was more funny  than that.  Yeah, that's funny.  See, you're paranoid.  I didn't even think gay  when he was telling that story.  No.  It's just funny.  It is funny.  Unless you were holding  a camera like a digital  and you said...  Yeah, they're not...  That I've never done. 
[00:30:00]  There you go.  It looks like a llama  kissed the lens.  So, these guys were chosen.  They had to, like, what?  You had to sign up  on the website  and then they picked  some names.  That's...  Oh, boy.  Why?  I don't like that.  I like the randomness  because then you get  the lunatics  and people that don't  have websites  or don't have computers.  We're not fans  of the well-behaved.  Let's just be honest.  No.  Are you guys well-behaved?  Yeah.  That guy looks like 
[00:30:30]  he could be trouble.  Is there alcohol involved?  Yeah, the guy  in the Philly shirt  looks like if he's got  a few drinks in him  he's dumping beers  over people's heads  at the game.  Hey, a fun fact  about Philly  because it is  Fun Fact Thursday.  Oh.  More beer is consumed  in Philadelphia  than any other city  in America.  That's not even...  There you go.  There you go.  There's your fun fact.  Why don't you just say  the sky is blue.  Oh, look at that  sun coming up, man.  Look at that.  How cool is that? 
[00:31:00]  It happens pretty much  once a day.  We don't see it  because the buildings  are in the way.  And speaking of buildings,  you know,  because you said that  it all comes down  to the buildings.  They're the ones  that are annoyed.  They're the ones  that don't want  to have fun.  They're building  a new studio  for us in New York  and it was supposed  to be done  two or three weeks ago.  I found out,  I think, yesterday.  Did we talk about  the dick that's  holding up construction?  There's a guy that...  There's a guy  that's in charge  of the freight elevator  and I guess you're 
[00:31:30]  supposed to make  deliveries between  like 12 noon  and 12.05.  Oh, great.  Something ridiculous  like that.  And these guys  are either a little early  or a little late.  The guy's making them  wait an entire day  just to bring materials  up to where  they're building  our new studio.  Why?  They're making no exceptions.  Why doesn't someone  just punch him in the face  and take the freight elevator?  So some of these guys  that are working  their asses off for us  to get the studio built,  they're showing up,  let's say,  I don't even know  the times,  but let's say  they're showing up  at 1.30  and you had to be there 
[00:32:00]  before 1.  These guys are now  sitting around New York  all day long,  all night,  waiting for the next chance  they could use  the freight elevator.  That's why there's  a delay on our studio.  Is that amazing?  Is there a reason  for that?  Why you can't grab  the guy by the lapels  and just smash his head  against the side  of the elevator?  The reason is  these guys are  on a power trip.  Is that the guy  with the glasses,  that douche  that sweeps up?  I'm not sure  which guy,  but they're on  a power trip.  I'm in charge  of the freight elevator.  Are you?  Great.  Good career planning. 
[00:32:30]  Did we have to do  website stuff  last time we were here?  Did they have to sign up  on the web  or they just came?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, this is what  radio has become.  You've got to  organize everything,  which just takes  all the excitement  out of doing a radio show.  They get scared.  Yeah, well.  God forbid someone  comes down  and utters something  into a microphone.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys have  anything for the show  today?  No.  Wait, someone's  raising their hand  in the back there, Danny.  I was gunshot guy  from last time.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to hang 
[00:33:00]  with gunshot guy again.  Again?  You got picked again?  Tell you the truth,  one of the most amazing  stories I've ever heard  on the radio.  The guy tries to  kill himself  and he survives, right?  Oops.  Are you doing all right, sir?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  I'm drunk, though.  You're drunk again?  I'm not.  Oh, you're not  drunk this time?  Oh, he was drunk  pretty early, yeah.  He was hammered.  He had bullet wounds  all over his body.  He was a little  delaying there.  I didn't hear him.  What?  Hot.  Yo.  Oh, hey, what's up? 
[00:33:30]  Just refresh  everyone's memory  from the last visit.  What happened to you?  Oh, yeah.  I was pretty messed up  and decided  I wanted to kill myself,  so I put a 380  to my chest  and I pulled the trigger.  That pretty much  sums it up.  And you hear bang?  Yeah.  Bang, then,  oh, God, what did I do?  And you don't die.  Yeah, it was real slow  kind of a process.  I got a problem  with the audience.  He just tells that story  and not one  oh, my God.  They don't care.  Oh, he just showed  the scar. 
[00:34:00]  He survived that.  Pretty amazing, right?  I've heard this before.  Oh, yeah, we heard it.  Do it again.  Hey, do it again.  We're going to stand high.  Is my bar pin  and stun for a minute?  Someone hand him a 380.  Did you,  I kind of forgot last time.  Were you just laying there  going,  all right,  I ought to die  any time now.  Yeah,  everything kind of went  blurry,  a little dim,  and then all of a sudden  I closed my eyes  and I realized  I wasn't dead  and I stood up  and stood up 
[00:34:30]  and then kind of  fell back down again  and it was just,  it was one of the worst  experiences ever.  Were you bleeding pretty good?  Oh, yeah,  it was pumping out.  Did they make you  clean up your own blood?  No, the funny thing was  when I came back  finally to my party.  Oh, wait, wait, wait,  hold on, sir.  Wait, what?  What did you say?  The funny thing is?  Oh, the funny thing.  Yes, hold on.  Hold on.  We like to get prepared  for funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Everyone get ready  for the funny.  I am getting  ready for funny. 
[00:35:00]  Put on those laughing hats.  You guys ready?  Are you guys ready  in there for the funny?  The funny part?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  The funny thing is  the fact that  I actually pulled out  my own catheter  after I was in the hospital.  Hey, I'm good, man.  Hey, I can't do radio gold 
[00:35:30]  twice in a row, you know?  Well, that is the funny part  of the whole thing.  I can't do it twice in a row,  you know?  I'm not drunk.  No, that's fine.  That's okay.  Hey, I'm bartending today,  so you guys should show up  and get drunk with me.  Hey, how did help  show up for you?  Ah, my roommate  busted in the room.  The question is,  why did help show up for you?  I ask myself  the same question every day.  It's a shame, isn't it?  Yeah.  All right.  Think about how many lives  could have been so much better  right now if I hadn't come here.  All right, so don't depress everybody. 
[00:36:00]  We're joking.  Anybody else?  We got a gunshot wound again.  Oh, God.  Cammy?  Cammy again.  Yes, Cammy.  Remember the guy  that had the green infection?  Oh, God damn.  He's stepping up to the mic now.  Your infection.  He had a brain operation.  How do we get this?  What?  He had a brain operation?  Yeah.  Wait, since the last time  we talked to him?  Right.  So that green, yellow pus ooze  that was coming out of his ear 
[00:36:30]  was something from a brain problem?  Yeah, that's what he said.  Holy mother of God.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is the guy  that crap was seeping out of your ear.  Dude, I can't even talk about this.  And we were putting it on spoons  and people were eating it and stuff?  Oh, God.  So you had a brain operation.  Was it an implant?  No, not quite.  It actually was an abscess infection.  It went in through the back of my skull  and went up towards my brain.  I was in hospital for about 15 days  and I was, you know,  home in bed on IV for about three months. 
[00:37:00]  Well, what exactly,  how did it get into your head?  It ate through part of my skull,  like in the back of the eardrum,  and it just traveled into the brain cavity.  What do you sleep on, a nail?  So that pus that was leaking out of your ear  was just a byproduct of this infection  that was going around your head?  Yes.  It started as an ear infection.  It went through the part of my ear  into my skull and then...  What part of your brain did it eat? 
[00:37:30]  The good part.  The part that judges good taste in radio shows.  It also ate his hair follicles.  Yes.  Yeah.  He looks like L. Ron Hubbard.  You should have an ascot on.  Damn, that's...  But yeah, now I have a big scar  on the back of my ear  that actually cut my ear off  to, you know, get the infection.  Cut out his brain, you bloody baboons!  So, what finally made you go to the doctor? 
[00:38:00]  I just couldn't sleep anymore.  My head was pounded.  I thought I had like a bunch of midgets  running around inside my head.  It was just a lot of trouble,  so finally I had to go get it checked out.  Welcome, Car Crash Comedy.  Yeah, we're doing that tomorrow.  Let's not forget.  Midgets running around his head.  So it was the pain  and not so much the oozing pus  out of your ear.  Yeah, yeah.  The oozing pus didn't bother me.  Just the pain bothered me. 
[00:38:30]  Well, the oozing pus bothered me.  Did it smell bad, the oozing pus?  Of course it did.  Yeah, yeah, very bad.  It smelled like an unclean woman.  An unclean.  You're unclean.  Oh, God.  That is terrific.  So the update,  you got the operation doing better?  Yeah, doing better.  You were the guy from...  I still can't hear out of this ear, but...  The left ear, you can't hear out of it?  No, not at all.  You're deaf out of your left ear?  Yes.  Because you let this infection go too long.  Yes.  All you needed was penicillin, right? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, antibiotics.  Absolutely.  Holy mother of God.  A drug that was invented years ago.  We all do what he does, though.  What?  We're all scared.  Not if pus is coming out of your ear.  You just hope it just goes away.  Yeah, I think it would go away after a little while.  Right.  A little while.  How long was pus dripping out of your ear, sir?  About eight months.  Eight months.  Take Tylenol.  He was the one that got...  Take Tylenol.  He was the one that got Bob Kelly puking pretty good last year.  Oh, yeah.  And that was one of the greatest times of my life last year. 
[00:39:30]  So I was just so excited about that, I didn't even care about it.  Glad we could turn your near-fatal problem into some fun for yourself.  Into some fun radio for everybody.  Uh-oh.  Yes, John Kenny.  Thanks, pussy ear guy.  He's got a stunt that I guess he wants to do on the XM side of the show.  What is it?  He wants to shave a part of his anatomy and put it on bread with, like, butter and eat it.  Why would we wait to do that?  Yeah, why would we wait?  I don't know if it was acceptable on...  It's not acceptable anywhere. 
[00:40:00]  It's not even acceptable in Thailand.  I say that's cute if he shaves like that.  But somebody...  A person's head hair or hair or whatever, armpit hair, that's not a bad thing.  Why would he eat it?  It wasn't those two parts.  I know.  Good.  All right.  Great.  All right, good.  I was saying...  Well, sit down before you...  Oh, my God.  Sit down before you pass out, okay?  He means you, Kenny.  Anybody else have anything for the show right now? 
[00:40:30]  You all good?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  I think we have a few empty seats, so I'm thinking, are there more people downstairs?  If not, I say you show up at the YSP Studios and we'll let you upstairs to check this crap out.  Be drunk and screaming and you get in faster.  The code word is...  All right, we got to take a break.  Tomorrow we're doing a live show in front of everybody at the TLA on South Street here in Philly.  We're doing a push-up contest into gross stuff.  Have we figured that out yet? 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  We did?  All right, we'll talk about it next.  It better be more exciting than the marble thing that Preston and Steve did down here in Philly.  That was great.  Oh, God.  Did you guys see that when they roll those two big marbles onto their mouth and then you realize, oh, those aren't marbles?  All right, we're live from Philly from the WISP Talks...  Talks is...  Studio.  And on the way down, Jimmy and I were just making fun of each other's, like, what we do on the radio. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, we were doing the blueberry.  The, what was the other one?  The morning show Bits...  Oh, Bitses.  And then I made Jimmy say...  Terrible.  It's terrible.  About a hundred times on the way down here.  Terrible.  Yesterday afternoon.  Well, the rally cry of YSP Talks may soon be silenced because nothing got Philadelphians excited like shouting YSP Talks.  They might as well have said, YSP breathes. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, Talks.  YSP likes breakfast.  All right, we're live from Philly.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Live from WISP in Philadelphia.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  With Jim Norton, of course. 
[00:42:30]  We're live from Philly from the WYSP studios.  We got about 30 or 40 people in a room.  Like they're waiting for jury duty or something.  Or like they're waiting at the DMV for their number to be called.  I don't think that's jury duty.  That's like the people that the juries judge.  And there's something happening down here in Philly.  One of the reasons why we came down early before our comedy show this Saturday at the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  Rumors are flying about what's happening to this fine radio station later today when Kid Chris makes the big announcement. 
[00:43:00]  All gay programming is the rumor.  Starting now.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, there he goes.  Something being taken off the wall.  Stripping down the YSP talks with flyers.  Yes.  Well, they got to make room for something new. 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  YSP whispers and jots down notes.  That's stupid.  Easy listening with W-Y-S-P.  Light FM.  94 W-Y-S-P.  Light FM.  All your light FM hits here at W-Y-S-P.  Urban.  Urban?  Let's go urban.  Country?  Hey.  Yes.  Can Americans just stop being such wishy-washy?  No.  Just little girls. 
[00:44:00]  In North Carolina, on the 6th anniversary of 9-11, students were not allowed to wear clothes with an American flag.  There's a new rule.  Like, you're not allowed to wear items in that school with flags from any country, including the U.S., I guess because this way other countries won't feel excluded.  So this girl wanted to wear a shirt, and she wasn't able to.  And the superintendent of school said that it's unfortunate, but says educators didn't want to be forced to pick and choose which flags should be permissible.  How about the flag of the country that the school is in? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  That could pretty much be the one that is allowed.  And all others are not allowed.  And then, yeah.  How about you start there?  Have your problems with the other ones and deal with that.  Oh, we have become little women.  We really are.  We're a disgusting group of fairies.  The whole country.  Just awful.  And we forget real quick, because if you think, like, the day after 9-11, six years ago, that they wouldn't allow an American flag in the school, do you think that would ever happen? 
[00:45:00]  No.  They'd be, remember all the American flags on the cars?  Well, I remember them on the side of the road.  In the gutter, yeah, after about a month or a couple of weeks, when they'd fly off the car, and the person finally just looks in the rear view and goes, ah, screw it.  I ain't even going to pick it up.  Forget it.  Yeah.  And you start yelling at people for cutting you off again.  Yeah.  Because I remember I was, I'm one of the most obnoxious drivers there are. 
[00:45:30]  And right after 9-11, I was driving, and I'd be like, oh, go ahead.  We're all in this together.  You could cut in front of me.  Go ahead.  Let's do this.  Oh, look.  The two lanes go into one.  Zipper, everyone.  Zipper.  Zipper, everyone.  We're all going to zipper.  Come on.  You go.  I go.  You go.  Come on, everybody.  We are all Americans here.  Cooperate.  That lasted like a month.  Then it was, screw you.  Honk, honk, honk.  Get out of the way.  You savage. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I still use that one.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, going with what Jimmy just reported, another hot chick kicked off a Southwest flight.  Wow.  Oh, this is another one?  And this girl is hotter than the other one.  Whoa.  Look at that.  Can you see that?  What do we got?  I know this is radio, but why don't you describe what you're looking at there, Anthony?  Holy.  What television show is this girl from?  This hot piece of ass was kicked off a Southwest flight.  She's a stripper.  She's got to be.  Yeah.  She probably did it on purpose or she could sue.  You think? 
[00:46:30]  No.  Sue everyone.  Well, we're thinking of sending a girl on a Southwest flight.  Let's do it immediately.  We're just discussing this during the break.  We want to get a girl in the hottest outfit possible.  Not something questionable.  We're talking.  It is obviously a really, really hot outfit.  But make her fat.  Let's get a...  Jimmy's always got an interesting spin to it.  Dude, let's get...  Make it a tranny.  Right.  No, no.  Let's get a fat pig into a little teeny miniskirt.  And she comes out of the bathroom in a little miniskirt. 
[00:47:00]  And they have to throw her off.  All right.  For dressing provocatively and for being a barnyard animal.  Yeah.  Sir in the blue, would you like to volunteer?  Just need a wig.  She's a brunette.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  I would guess 34 full C's if I may there, Anthony.  All right.  You can see that from that picture.  And what was she wearing?  Like this?  Was she wearing that?  She was...  It's like a pretty dress.  She kind of looked like Britney Spears.  What?  The Britney Spears look. 
[00:47:30]  I wouldn't even...  The Britney Spears look is what I'm saying.  You can't even use that anymore, though.  Why?  I am refusing to let anybody use that as anything hot anymore.  You can't say the Britney Spears...  Oh, she looks like Britney Spears or the body...  Leave her alone!  David, why is everybody getting on her?  Leave her alone!  Shut up, you poofter.  Hey, hey.  That thing is calling our show today.  Is it?  That thing will be calling our show today.  And the thing is saying that it's real. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Everyone has seen the video.  Have you guys seen the video, Britney Spears fan?  Yeah.  I heard it.  I'm crying.  You heard it on our show?  Well, here it is just in case people weren't listening yesterday.  And how f***ed does anyone out there make fun of Britney?  After all she's been through, she loves her aunt.  She went through a divorce.  She had two f***ing kids.  Her husband turned out to be a user, a cheater.  And now she's going through a custody battle. 
[00:48:30]  All you people care about is...  I love how it can't keep the voice going.  Yeah.  Going through a custody battle.  Custody battle.  The only person crying more is this kid's father.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  All right.  It is readers and making money off of her.  She's a human.  What you don't realize is that Britney's making you all this money.  And all you do is write a bunch of crap about her. 
[00:49:00]  She hasn't performed on stage in years.  Her song is called Give Me More for a reason.  Because all you people want is more, more, more, more, more.  Leave her alone.  Is that how you screamed, Jimmy, when your friend was being beat up?  Yes.  And you were running away.  And you said, leave him alone?  No, he yelled that about me.  Oh, oh, right.  He yelled it about you.  Leave him alone.  Why do I keep thinking you weren't getting beaten? 
[00:49:30]  I wasn't.  The guy just smacked the back of my head while we were running.  You were running away?  Yes, my friend and I were running from about 12 black gentlemen carrying sticks.  They either wanted to play hockey or cave our white skulls in.  You couldn't really figure it out, right?  No, I'm trying to run with my fat laces.  I deserved exactly what I got.  You're lucky she even performed for you bastards.  Leave Britney alone.  Please. 
[00:50:00]  Perez Hilton talked about professionalism and said if Britney was a professional, she would have pulled it off no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who's going through a hard time?  Leave Britney alone.  Leave Britney alone.  Please.  Leave Britney Spears alone right now. 
[00:50:30]  I mean it.  Anyone who has a problem with her, you deal with me.  Because she's not well right now.  That'll be a tough fight.  Here it comes.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  No, we don't give up.  Leave her alone.  There it is.  Leave her alone.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  So, it's very obvious to us that's fake. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  But this thing is saying that's real.  Yeah, that it was real emotion.  And Steve, I guess, talked to the thing yesterday.  Steve's got to learn how to do, like, not even pre-interviews.  Thank you, Ant.  We haven't even talked about this.  Yeah, yeah.  I know exactly what you're going to say.  Yeah.  Steve almost blew up our spot because he doesn't know how to talk to these people.  Steve's job.  Because his anger gets in the way.  Steve's job when we get guests, when we're trying to get a guest, especially, like, this  guy or one of these, like, pop culture people that'll be out of the news in, you know, 15 
[00:51:30]  minutes, your job, Steve, is to call them, kiss their ass, and treat them like they are  so special so we can bash them when we get them on the air.  You are supposed to lead them to the lion's cage.  Right.  And you started, like, the bashing process when you're on the phone with them, not even  on the air or anything.  I swear to you, at the time, as I'm in the moment, it doesn't occur to me that what I'm 
[00:52:00]  saying might be offensive.  And as it leaves the mouth, I'm like, ooh, wrong thing.  What left your mouth?  And you said wrong thing.  We're getting ready for the show.  Does it have to go game?  And Steve's explaining how the phone call went last night, and I'm rolling my eyes, and  now I knew you'd be rolling your eyes, too.  Because you were arguing with the thing.  I wasn't arguing.  I simply made one comment, and...  What was the comment?  Here we go.  I said, I asked him how he was enjoying his 15 minutes.  Great.  That's an insult. 
[00:52:30]  Like, when somebody thinks they're gaining popularity...  Right.  ...to say how you're enjoying your 15 minutes is kind of an insult.  Did you not mean it to be confrontational?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Stop.  I swear to you, it was trying to be friendly with this guy.  And then you also said something about how he was fake.  Uh, yeah.  What did you say?  What was that?  Why would the thing want to come on our show after all?  He does.  I know.  Like, what...  But now he's going to come on with us being, you know, it's going to be a confrontational  thing right from the start. 
[00:53:00]  Steve, your whole...  Instead of us, you know, guiding the way this interview goes.  Steve, your whole job behind the scenes is to make believe you work for Scott and Todd.  Everything's like, oh, wow, man.  And the guys really feel for you.  A lot of emotion came out in that video.  Yeah.  And you're supporting Britney Spears.  The guys are big Britney Spears fans.  And they're on your side, man.  They're right there with you.  That's your job.  If I thought his angle was...  If I really thought that he was legit, because going into this, I thought he was...  It doesn't matter what you think.  Right.  Seriously. 
[00:53:30]  It really doesn't.  In that situation.  Or many others.  Right.  Your whole job is to not question anything.  What did you say about him being fake?  I said, tell me about the video.  I think I asked him, tell me about the videos.  And then he told me he'd been doing it for a while.  And I said, now are these...  I said, now what did you expect the reaction to be?  Like, he said...  And then when he said...  You said something like...  I said...  Did you expect anybody to believe this?  Yeah, something...  Yeah, great.  I said something to that effect.  It was something like... 
[00:54:00]  It was something to that effect.  I don't remember the conversation.  How is that going to help our radio show?  Seriously.  Let's get into this for a minute.  How is it going to help?  If you were taping it, then it would be good.  But you're not taping it.  So now this thing is going to be on guard when...  Yeah.  I don't think so, man.  And potentially could have just hung up on you and said, well, screw you guys.  Right.  I'm gun him.  No, he didn't.  He didn't.  I know you're an angry person, but you can't...  You got to play it differently on the phone.  A way to word that might have been...  Are you surprised by the reaction where people were saying it wasn't real? 
[00:54:30]  Did that reaction surprise you?  Like this way, you're like, oh, yes, it was very real.  Yes.  Yes.  But you might not even mention the fake angle.  You might say that...  If you do, you always want them to think that you're siding with them.  Right.  And then we get to hit them with the sledgehammer.  I honestly didn't think I was saying anything...  You're going to stop right there.  You're thinking again.  I honestly didn't think.  I just have to remove the brain before...  I think...  Please.  I think so enough.  You need an ear infection.  That creeps around your head.  Someone else has to talk to these people off air. 
[00:55:00]  Because you can't help yourself.  Why did we start with the pre-interviews?  Have we always been doing that?  No, no.  It wasn't a pre-interview.  It was just trying to get the guy on the air.  Yeah.  Trying to get the guy on the phone.  Which then should just be, you know, kiss his ass.  Kiss, kiss, kiss.  No questioning.  We'll question it.  Why about us?  Say we're huge Britney Spears fans and we think she did a great job.  She looked great.  Yeah.  And blah, blah, blah.  And then he comes on like pals and then we blindside him.  Right.  I thought...  You know what?  I think...  Oh, boy.  What did you say? 
[00:55:30]  He's thinking again.  How about this?  One of the guys knows K-Fed a long time and never liked him.  You know, if you're going to throw something silly in there and then tell us we can run  with it.  Oh, yeah.  Just lay down the bread.  Every indication is that this guy said he was a comedian.  So I went into this assuming that he was a prankster.  Assuming.  Assuming.  Well, that's not your job.  What happened when we assumed?  That's not your job.  We got to hit you with bars of soap in our pillowcases.  No, we don't.  We really do.  Ow.  No.  Ow.  Nobody likes me. 
[00:56:00]  No, we don't.  You're screwing up.  Getting everyone in trouble.  When is this thing calling us?  In an hour.  In an hour from right now.  That's the big get today here in Philly?  Certainly is.  That you almost blew?  Ooh.  I did not.  I say that Steve blew this one.  Well.  All right.  He's too far away.  We should apologize.  What happened?  No, no.  We should apologize to him for Steve's line of questioning. 
[00:56:30]  Ah, very good.  I believe we should begin that by saying we don't go for that.  Yeah.  We don't go for that here on the Opie and Anthony program.  That kind of guff.  Yeah.  We don't appreciate being spoken to like that, and we think you should apologize to him on  the air at the start of the interview, and that will take that little delicious fellow  off guard, and then we can attack him.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  So the Britney thing is calling us.  But what if he doesn't even remember?  Huh?  See, this guy, this kid's doing so much press.  Oh, is he?  He barely remembers.  I had to reintroduce myself when I called him a second time. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, you didn't make a good first impression.  Yeah.  I'm amazed that the media's, you know.  They're all, he's doing phoners in Australia.  But they think this is real.  It's not real.  He's the new, like, thing.  Wait, someone thinks it's real?  Yeah, he was on Kid Chris the other day.  Yeah.  Kid Chris gets everyone before us.  He was the, the first interview that guy did was Kid Chris.  Right.  What do you see all the people, all the wackos that are going to call into the show?  Like, they all believe it.  They buy into it.  They think he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
[00:57:30]  He's a tool.  Since sliced bread?  Wow.  Wow, that is great.  You know, we've discussed it on our show.  Is sliced bread that great?  You know what?  The greatest thing since sliced bread.  That saying must have been made up, like, years ago.  When it was like, sliced bread.  Jesus Christ, this is great.  Before that, I had to slice it myself.  I was cutting it myself.  This is the greatest thing since, since fire.  Since bread itself.  That I had to cut. 
[00:58:00]  They would just sell bread in a bag of giant bread balls.  And you had to make a sandwich out of bread balls.  And it would fall all over.  And then someone said, let's slice it neatly.  Slice it?  Are you crazy?  You can't slice bread.  The Jews won't allow it.  You're a witch.  You're a witch.  A witch, I say.  All right, so getting back to Britney.  So the hot girl that has the Britney look, much hotter than Britney, got kicked off Southwest.  See, we bring it right back around.  Here's the story.  In case you're wondering why a young woman wearing this dress would completely bundle up. 
[00:58:30]  I was sitting like this on the plane.  Like a psycho.  Satara Kasim says it was not her idea that 100-degree day she flew back from Las Vegas on Southwest Airlines.  A flight attendant came up to me and asked me if I had a sweater.  And I said no, because why would I pack a sweater in that heat?  So I asked her why, and she said because I need to cover up.  And she did this.  I need to cover up.  Now, don't stop me if you've heard this before, because you have. 
[00:59:00]  Just last Friday on the Today Show, a young woman from San Diego told her story of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant  taking issue with the propriety of her attire.  This is a family airline.  You're too provocative to fly on this flight.  The way she described how she felt was exactly how I felt about the whole situation.  Amazing.  Jesus.  Amazing.  What is wrong with Southwest Airlines?  I don't know.  That they don't want...  The girl's dressed.  She's not doing the slip. 
[00:59:30]  She's got a sexy dress on.  The little whoopsie.  And she's young enough where she doesn't need a bra whatsoever.  She's got some nice-sized boobies, and, you know, she's just flying.  I would love to see the mess that has a problem with this.  Yeah.  Well, that's just it.  You know, you don't get to see what the person looks like that kicked her off the flight.  This is once they took those regulations off of the flight stews, the stews, that they  could be old bags, fat gentlemen of questionable sexuality. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, there's a rumor some of them like girls.  Then these girls are now being victimized by jealous stews that don't want to have to  look at these beautiful girls as they walk down the aisle doing their waitress job.  Because they want all the attention.  Of course they do.  They want to have the pinches from the businessmen as they're walking by. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, hey, hey.  The pinches.  When was the last time you heard the word pinch?  Who the hell's on the plane, Larry Tate?  Make it a double.  Right.  The flight attendants, they want the pinches.  They want the ass pinches.  Imagine pinching the ass of a flight attendant in this day and age.  When was that ever acceptable?  The air marshal would shoot you.  It was completely acceptable.  There was a time that you were allowed to pinch ass. 
[01:01:00]  She would just turn around, cover her mouth, and go, tee hee.  Tee hee.  You could pinch an ass years ago in the office, your secretary, hey, thanks a lot.  You did great dictation.  Wow.  And you pinch her ass.  Thanks for the documents.  And she goes, you know, oh, sir.  Right.  It was all just fun and games.  That was great.  You got to pinch an ass every once in a while.  And then some bull dyke had to stop everything.  That stupid women's lib.  Yeah, that ruined everything. 
[01:01:30]  A guy pinched an ass, and the woman said, wait a minute.  Why am I putting up with that?  It's an ongoing theme on our show, what women's lib has ruined.  Oh, the ass pinch.  Let's add it to the list, Jimmy.  You're keeping track, right?  Add it to the list.  The harmless inter-office, or when you're out, the ass pinch on the hot girl.  Thank you, toots.  And you give her a little pinch between your bent pointer finger and your thumb.  That's how you pinch her. 
[01:02:00]  And then you go.  And you flick a shekel onto her tray.  And she was happy.  Who decided a pat wasn't good enough?  They had to go with the pinch of the ass.  The old pinch.  Let's bring back the ass pinch.  E-Rock, come here.  It's Ass Pinch Thursday on the old Big Anthony Show.  Ass Pinch Thursday.  Come on, YSP.  Start making bumper stickers.  Ass Pinch.  And a good sadistic ass pinch, too.  You leave a nice black and blue mark.  Oh, a good one.  With your nail. 
[01:02:30]  There's a little crescent nail mark on her ass.  The old ass pinch.  You got a little aggressive.  Maybe that's what ruined it.  All right, we got more.  Some guy didn't understand.  You're just supposed to give it a little pinch.  Yeah, he'd pinch it so hard, and his pinky would go to the wrong place.  All right, here's the pinch.  Oh.  We got more audio on the hot chick getting kicked off the Southwest flight.  We spoke with Ms. Kassim too late to get a response from Southwest, but last week, in  response to Everett being asked to pull up her tank top and pull down her skirt, Southwest 
[01:03:00]  issued a statement that read in part, when a concern is brought to our employees' attention,  we address that situation directly with the customer involved in a discreet and professional  manner.  Kassim counters, if an airline wants to enforce a dress code, it should post some specifics.  Not just the flight attendants deciding on their own whether you're looted and offensive  or not.  Oh, the jealous flight attendants.  Yep.  That should be stated there.  Yeah, the jealous flight attendants.  That's what that's all about.  Don't worry.  Don't worry, toots.  You'll look just fine. 
[01:03:30]  Don't worry.  We'll give you an ass pinch.  Yeah, she'd get an ass pinch from me.  Don't worry, toots.  Looking good, honey.  Give me the old, all right.  Probably some animal that pinched a girl too hard and had to like take some of her ass  skin out from underneath his fingernail.  He pinched her so hard.  Just ruined everything.  She tried to run away and she was still caught between his thumb and finger and he wouldn't  let her go.  His fingers were actually touching between her ass flesh like it was an eyelid.  He had pinched her so hard. 
[01:04:00]  She had to get plastic surgery on her ass cheeks.  And ruined it all.  Enough's enough.  Uh, Steven asks for Bayshore.  You can still pinch a flight attendant, but you have to finish up with a no homo, which  will disappoint the swishy steward.  The steward.  And we got Concho Pete.  He wants to come down to the YSP Cafe.  Concho Pete?  Yeah, he had a business meeting canceled.  So come on down.  I think we have a little room in the, uh, in the, uh, wow, the exciting YSP Cafe.  Oh, the madness.  The madness is ensuing as we speak. 
[01:04:30]  Just come down.  Just come down.  We'll let you up here.  And then someone just writes, soda is the greatest.  That's it, huh?  So, well, soda is the greatest.  I mean, let's not forget.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Say no.  Forgot about that.  Say no to H2O.  Wait, why?  You can't play this today.  Why?  Because it's not, well, Wednesday.  It's not, uh, morning show bits.  Morning show, lousy morning show bits.  What was it called?  Uh, morning show bits.  Morning zoo bits.  Man, morning zoo bits.  Bits.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Morning, wait.  Can't carry it over to Thursday. 
[01:05:00]  Who bits, but now it's just a bit.  But it sucks.  That's why we played it.  This song's actually good.  Yeah, but this is part of.  No, it isn't, Jimmy.  This is part of Get a Song Stuck in the Listener's Head Thursday.  That is not a day.  I'm keeping track.  I'm fighting for this one.  People think I'm retarded.  I want to start Get a Song Stuck in the Listener's Head Thursday.  I don't know.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O. 
[01:05:30]  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Man, it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O.  Gotta go when you serve that H2O.  Oh.  Yeah.  Nuts, man.  Oosh.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're live from Philly at the YSP studio where something is going to happen today.  We don't know what.  We don't know what.  I'm looking around.  You're scaring me. 
[01:06:00]  When they came to New York a couple days ago and said, look, we want.  Oh, boy.  We're thinking about making the announcement when you guys do your live show at the TLA sometime  in the eight o'clock hour.  You and I started laughing at them like, yeah, OK, no one's going to know.  I went, har, har, hearty, har, har.  I can't believe they're going new wave with this radio station.  Yeah.  80s new wave on YSP.  People sound thrilled.  Then we all pinched each other's ass in the conference room. 
[01:06:30]  Well, something's going on.  For everybody in the Philly area, listen to Kid Chris.  He'll have the big announcement at five o'clock.  Five o'clock.  Whatever that announcement might be.  It's when it's going down.  I don't think it has anything to do with the brand new sweatshirt you're wearing.  What sweatshirt?  The Rock Station.  It says 94 WISP, The Rock Station.  That's almost as bad as saying YSP Talk.  Maybe it's all talk about geology.  It could happen.  It's a format that hasn't been talked about. 
[01:07:00]  The Rock Station.  Come on.  It's just on.  That's right.  It's programming.  It's to compete with the paper and scissor stations.  The Rock in and out opening in Philadelphia.  We're taking your call on quartz.  Well, there's a lot of geologists out there that are out of work, so this is perfect for them.  Exactly.  Just a little observation.  94 WISP, The Rock Station.  Yeah.  Huh? 
[01:07:30]  That's it?  Don't you start.  Someone came up with this, and right now they're listening going, son of a bitch.  I hope they're in.  That's Opie.  Here he goes.  I hope they didn't get a lot of money for coming up with the slogan, The Rock Station.  You know, they all sat there thinking, look, it's simple.  It's to the point.  It tells what it is.  You know, a lot of people.  What do we want to do?  Get this long-winded thing about what it is?  It's WISP, The Rock Station.  You know, a very sad day yesterday.  They fired a lot of guys.  Is it going to be THE Rock Station or The Rock Station? 
[01:08:00]  But hear me out.  Yesterday, they fired a lot of guys, so it's very sad, right?  Yeah.  But obviously, they didn't fire the guy that came up with 94 WISP, Talks.  Oh, because you think it's the same guy?  Now they got 94 WISP, The Rock Station.  The Rock Station.  94 WISP, It's Radio.  YSP, Sounds.  They should just do the sounds of silence. 
[01:08:30]  Don't make fun of it.  It's The Rock Station.  What does that mean?  It means when you think of a rock station, you're thinking of WISP, The Rock Station.  That's it.  That's right.  Just one half-black, half-white wrestler talking all day.  Not The Rock.  Oh.  My timing's off.  That wasn't for you.  That was for the whole explanation Anthony had. 
[01:09:00]  Well, I think it's good that something's coming back.  We don't know what it is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All they do is talk about that movie, that Nicolas Cage movie from Alcatraz.  Yeah.  The whole station's about Alcatraz.  You see when he shot that missile, dude?  How long would you listen to a station like that?  Forever.  The first hour would be really interesting.  And then it's like...  Like when Nicolas Cage at the end uses the flares and the plane flies. 
[01:09:30]  That was the end of the movie.  All right.  Well, a week into it, we're going to have an exclusive interview with the key grip from  that film.  The Rock.  Because it is WISP, The Rock Station.  The Rock Station.  Where we only talk about the movie The Rock.  Or all things Alcatraz.  Right.  All things...  Oh, okay.  The Rock.  Because it was called The Rock.  It's Clint Eastwood Tuesdays.  Yeah.  Giveaway trips to The Rock every weekend.  Great.  About Al Capone.  All right.  Something's happening here in Philly. 
[01:10:00]  Anything a homeless guy has used to brain a white woman on the street?  The Rock.  Of course.  There's so many ways this can go.  So, why is there a rumor that it's going to be a rock station like music?  Right.  Well, you have to listen at five to find out.  Yeah.  We've already given you four or five different circumstances that could have been completely  different than music.  All right.  There you go.  We're live from WISP.  You guys having a good time out there?  What?  Oh, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:10:30]  Oh!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show live from Philly from the WISP studio where  something is going on.  Something's happening.  Where are they hiding the station vehicles?  You know, there's a fresh paint job on those babies.  Do you think it doesn't say WISP talks on the vans anymore?  I would bet a lot of money now. 
[01:11:00]  YSP chats amicably.  People are trying to figure out what's going on here in Philly.  We got JD from Atlanta.  He's kind of interested.  It is a reason why we came down early just to kind of celebrate with YSP what they're  about to do today.  JD in Atlanta, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I bet the new van's going to have a picture of Lindsey and Gage in the ring on it.  Oh!  Punch it out.  I don't know.  YSP rocks. 
[01:11:30]  Rocks.  That'd be good.  I've seen that ring.  The van will be doing a wheelie if it's in the back of it.  Jesus, dude.  Paint it on a bus, maybe.  But it shouldn't make you happy, though.  I can't blow up anything anytime soon, man.  But that must mean we're being syndicated to Canada and London.  Yeah, Opie's going to be the one.  Now, boys, let's keep this show safe.  Oh, he's been Kenny Conservative.  Guys, don't say tush.  I laughed at that movie Blood Diamond.  I don't give a crap how they get these things. 
[01:12:00]  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared, what's up?  Gobbling people.  Who cares?  Hey, man.  I know who the new YSP The Rock afternoon drive time host is.  Who?  Reginald Denny.  That was pretty funny.  Reginald Denny.  That's right.  It could have been called YSP The Toilet as well.  The planter.  Yes.  YSP The Kick to the Face.  YSP Lock the Truck, Stupid.  I'll keep going with Reginald Denny jokes until they laugh.  Thank you.  They're too busy checking their black clothes. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, I want to say hi to the homeless guy we saw at the bus station on the way to YSP today.  Old Twitchy?  Old Twitchy.  I called him Old Twitchy.  Guy's right arm was shaking uncontrollably.  He had something going on.  He was sleeping on a park bench, but he had a comfy pillow.  What was it?  Oh, yeah.  A shoebox.  A shoebox.  He had a pillow.  It was a shoebox.  And he's just laying his head there, and his arm was twitching.  Poor bastard.  A lot of homeless guys here. 
[01:13:00]  And it's not like New York homeless are different.  They kind of hide in the shadows.  You know?  They're in little doorways that smell of urine.  And these guys, I don't know, they're kind of living the life of Riley.  They're kind of living.  They're out on the bus benches, not being riled, hassled by the cops.  They leave him alone here.  Do they?  Yeah, it looks like it.  Danny's working the O&A cafe, which is just terrific. 
[01:13:30]  I mean, look at these guys.  The madness is ensuing.  They had to get up at 4.30 for this crap.  And it's well organized.  There's still room in the cafe if you're in the area.  We'll just let you up at this point.  That's why I don't like things to be organized.  They had to go to a website, and then YSP had to pick who was going to come here.  We know how that works, too.  If you pick, like, 40 people, 20 show up.  You've got to overbook.  So you've got to pick 80.  Right.  So 40 show up?  Is that how it works mathematically?  I'm trying 50% carry the two. 
[01:14:00]  But Danny's been working the crowd, and there's a guy that's just staring at someone's feet.  Well, yeah, and I don't know who it is because, obviously, all of their submissions are anonymous,  but I was just reading through them.  And, yeah, somebody's been staring at one of the girls that works here's feet, apparently.  Someone's got a little foot fetish.  Yeah, and they would like to do things with the feet.  Is the girl hot?  I mean, you guys probably remember her from last time.  She was the intern that was here that kind of got a little mouthy.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Can we bring her in?  Yeah, sure.  She was lovely.  Let me go get her.  Look, look, look.  We got off on the wrong foot last time.  Let's see if, you know.  You're right.  I didn't like the way she addressed my friend, and then we all felt it was necessary to speak  harshly.  I know.  A lot of time has passed.  Let's just wipe the slate clean.  Absolutely.  We got off on the wrong hoof.  Let's just be nice.  I was going to say that.  I know you are.  I saw you percolating.  I really was. 
[01:15:00]  I'm teasing, of course.  She has no idea that she's getting let go today.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  Did she come up with the rock station?  Where is she?  By the way, someone's saying the phones suck.  Yeah, there's something going on.  I heard more in my right ear than I did my left ear, and I don't believe I have pus oozing  out of this one, so I think it's a technical glitch and not a brain one.  Hi.  Good morning. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  Yeah, we go way back.  No, she's cute.  You're cuter today than you were last time we saw you.  Yeah.  What happened?  You're just PMSing or something.  You seem a little taller on radio.  So what's going on?  There's nothing wrong with her.  Not at all.  What the hell were we saying?  What a bunch of idiots we are.  I just want to say, we are jerks.  No, we're not.  Yes, we are.  I forgive you.  No, I wasn't saying she wasn't being a bitch.  Exactly.  But we're like jerks.  I said I was PMSing. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  You just snapped back at me again.  I did not.  You went, I said I was PMSing.  Uh, YSP, YSP Kvetchis.  Why are you wearing the YSP Talks t-shirt?  Classic now.  And why is E-Rock taking pictures of her butt?  E-Rock?  Because it's a lot to take a picture of.  Is it big?  Is it?  It's pretty big.  What kind of underpants do you sport with a big butt?  That's nice.  Uh, non-underpants.  No, you can't.  All right.  That's nice.  Anyway, what did you ask him about me? 
[01:16:30]  I like boy shorts.  Let me see your feet.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I'm not into feet.  That's why.  Me neither.  She has damn nice feet.  Because somebody is staring at your feet.  They're well-muscled, too.  You what?  See, they're nice feet.  They really are.  But I, it does nothing for me.  All right, let me and Jimmy say.  Who is this person?  Come around this way so we can see.  Look at my feet.  Look at this.  I haven't seen them.  Did you put your foot up there so well?  I'm not into feet.  I don't have a foot fetish, but.  No, you know what?  Ugly feet will.  They're pretty ugly. 
[01:17:00]  No, no.  Those are fine.  They're fine.  Wow, your toes could pick up like sticks, though, right?  I can pick stuff up with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's weird, because usually girls that have like long toes have those ligaments and  stuff that go up and very talon-like.  But yours aren't.  I have no ligaments.  And they're like tanned?  Yeah.  See?  I've got a nice brawns going on.  And you've got red nail polish on them.  With polka dots.  Oh, they've got polka dots on them.  Right.  So they're very well taken care of, it looks like. 
[01:17:30]  Thank you.  It's still morning time.  Would you let one of these creeps lick your feet?  Aw.  Why don't you put it?  She's like, aw.  Well, who's the creep that likes her feet?  Yeah, who wants to lick my feet?  Do we have to pick out who it is?  Oh, the guy raised his hand.  Move to the microphone there, sir.  Here's a foot fetish.  Like George Clooney's going to stand up out of the middle of that crowd and say, it was  me.  We've done a lot on the foot fetish thing.  I don't get it at all.  I don't get it either.  But this guy, you've been staring at her feet?  I love feet. 
[01:18:00]  What is it about?  I don't even know what her feet look like.  And I will look.  He's not bad.  They said that you were looking at her feet.  Nice.  Yeah.  It wasn't me, but I will do it.  What about feet?  Wait, it's not even you?  No, the other guy's raising his hand like, ah, now everybody wants to.  Hey, two guys, two feet.  Wait, where's the other guy?  Bring the other guy up.  This is the guy that actually was staring at your feet.  Stay close, sir.  The other guy that came up.  This is the guy that was staring at your feet and wants to suck on him or lick on him. 
[01:18:30]  It's harmless.  It's not.  Oh, boy.  He's all right.  He's not the fat guy.  Is that the one that shot himself?  No.  That's not the guy who shot himself.  No, that's the one that should have.  Yeah.  What's your name, sir?  Ron.  And you, Lee Harvey.  That story you told about the cow?  So what's up, buddy?  You were staring at her feet?  Well, yeah, I was sitting at the end of the aisle, and her feet were on the table.  Her feet were on the table. 
[01:19:00]  I was not sitting on the job.  Kind of right in front of me.  Yeah.  Not much else to look at here.  What he wrote down?  He's just insult every other girl that's sitting in there.  He's just stating the obvious.  One of the other girls that came with guys, one came in late.  Oh, okay.  This guy wrote down, I've been staring at the cute feet of the chick working for YSP all morning long,  and I really want to suck on her toes.  Wow.  What is it about her feet, sir?  Like, what's the...  I like feet.  Try to explain the foot fetters to everybody. 
[01:19:30]  I don't get it.  I don't know how to explain it.  How long have you liked them, feet?  Since I saw my first Playboy.  You went right to the feet?  Jesus.  I think you missed the point of that magazine.  He got an issue that was run through a shredder.  He just kind of, hey, a foot.  Yeah.  That's hot.  I don't know.  When I was a kid looking at my hot teacher's feet, fourth grade. 
[01:20:00]  I heard the in-between toes looks like cleavage, and that's why maybe.  Is that...  I don't know.  That doesn't do it for me.  Okay.  Yeah.  She's got really long toes, though.  How about mommy feet?  Yeah, they're very long.  You might be into something else.  They're even.  And then, like, she doesn't have one big toe.  Oh, see.  This guy's got a whole agenda.  This guy's got, like, a whole agenda set up.  Why, why?  For feet.  No, he just does.  He said, you know, they're long.  Yeah, but they're all even.  Like, he has studied feet.  Yeah.  This guy knows what he likes about feet.  Like, a guy would like a certain type of breasts or a butt or something like that. 
[01:20:30]  This guy is thinking the same way about tootsies, right?  Right.  Well, they're even.  He just means that there's some on the left and some on the right.  Unlike Heather Mills.  Well, are you going to let this guy suck on your feet?  I just can't imagine they would taste very good.  How about this?  Well, there's other things that you wouldn't imagine taste good.  Well, you'll be respectful, right?  You won't grow up her body or do anything. 
[01:21:00]  No.  Oh, God, no.  Okay.  What does he want to do?  I'll have to ask my bosses.  Cup the heel.  Is that your technique?  Do you cup the heel and then go for the toes?  Or what do you do?  I don't really have a technique.  Yeah?  Do you like knees?  I don't be tickling or nothing.  It all depends what angle you're at.  If you're on the knees and the foot's here or you're laying in the bed and the foot's down here.  Wow, this guy is so into feet.  This guy is really into feet.  I like a pretty foot, but it's got to be part of the whole package. 
[01:21:30]  You know what I mean?  It's not like this guy looking at Playboy and going right for the feet or having a foot fetish.  But I like it with the whole package.  Like I said, I like girls completely naked.  I don't like fancy stuff on.  It could start that way.  But I need a girl to take everything off at some point.  I don't want stockings on.  A little clothing is very great.  No, no, that's cool at first.  Dude, when a girl walks in wearing some kind of nice Victoria's Secret stuff, it is sexy as hell.  But that crap's got to go.  I like naked. 
[01:22:00]  Naked.  And the feet are part of that.  Totally nude.  It's like you ever do where the legs have to kind of go up above your shoulder level?  And a lot of guys will grab ankle.  I like grabbing and putting fingers between the toes and grabbing that way.  How awful that must feel for the girl.  You don't have fingers, but put fingers between your toes.  It feels terrible. 
[01:22:30]  No one likes fingers between your toes.  I'm not talking arm wrestling with her leg.  It's like in fingertips and stuff.  And then like kind of...  Doesn't that be like holding a chimp's hand?  His feet are so weird.  I'd make a joke, but we'd get in trouble.  I was really into your story until the end there.  No, it's Scott, dude!  You took the sexiness out of it.  No, it's very sexy.  And Danny was completely agreeing. 
[01:23:00]  All right, listen.  Me and Danny.  I got the idea.  I got the idea.  This guy is really into feet.  And you really like her feet, right, sir?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not going to...  If she was a cow, I wouldn't be looking at her feet.  No, she's...  Oh, okay.  So you don't like ugly chick feet.  No, she's very cute.  Right.  And I'm thinking that he's got to do something else to get to her feet.  I agree.  Maybe play with Club Sword of Kenny's feet for a while.  Holy Jesus. 
[01:23:30]  Or E-Rock's feet.  Wait, wait.  We got another special guest maybe wants to...  Oh, yes.  Another young lady's outside.  What?  Another young lady's outside.  Bring it on!  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Where is this...  Where is this enchantress?  Bring this temptress in.  I don't know.  Does she have big feet, too?  Oh, so...  Oh, all right.  All right.  So my idea's going to work.  We just substitute this thing.  For, uh...  Wow-wee. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Yeah, real believable.  How are you?  Oh, God.  Hi.  We met you on...  How are you?  You gave us a call last week.  You're on the Kid Chris show a lot.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you got to watch that.  Why are you cursing?  You can't curse.  Hotty mouth.  Don't curse.  Put the headphones...  What do you think this is?  That's right.  You're worried about messing up your hair?  No, they slid off my hair.  Like, that's the problem?  They slid off my hair.  Oh.  There you go.  All right.  Make up the headphones. 
[01:24:30]  So, uh...  You call the Kid Chris show a lot.  You're, uh...  You're, uh...  You're, uh...  You're, uh...  Tranny?  Yes, I'm...  Are you a transvestite?  No, I'm not a transvestite.  Are you a transsexual?  I'm a transsexual.  Transformation.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  Wait, what did that run you?  What, did it run me?  Yeah, how much did you get for one of those?  How much did they get?  So far, I spent $26,000 on the face.  26 G's?  On the face?  On the face.  Yes.  Someone should be fired.  What about, uh...  Jesus. 
[01:25:00]  What about the, uh...  You know, the operation to, uh...  Take off the goods?  Well, the police are gone.  Yeah, I know.  How much does that cost?  You didn't do what a circular saw?  No, that was about $3,500.  Wait, $3,500?  Wait, we're going way too fast here, though.  What do they do to your face for $26,000?  I had the cheeks.  I had the brow bone shaved down.  I had a nose job done.  Cool.  You got any...  Well, I probably wouldn't have pictures of you when you were, you know...  Wait, you got cheek implants? 
[01:25:30]  A dude.  Well, they shave them down, yeah.  They take your...  They cut you and they pull your face down and shave you.  Oh, my...  Yeah.  Wow.  It is a dude.  It is a dude.  No.  I mean...  All right, listen.  We're running late, so you guys stay right there.  What we're going to do is we got foot fetish guy.  We got sexy intern.  What are you?  What's it?  Hi here.  I'm on the street team.  All right, you're on the street team with the sexy feet and she's cute.  And the guy wants to suck on her feet, but we're thinking the guy has to go through 
[01:26:00]  your feet, the Trinity's feet first, to get to the sexy feet.  No?  I didn't get a pedicure in the last week.  That's all right.  That makes it even better.  That makes it better.  That's fine.  All right, we'll figure it all out.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Philly at YSP.  Opie and Anthony live from WYSP in Philly.  Live from Philly, it's the Opie and Anthony show from the YSP studios. 
[01:26:30]  They're bringing in boxes of CDs.  I don't know what that means.  Oh, yeah?  What could that possibly mean?  Maybe for a prize closet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who knows?  I guess we'll find out later.  Yeah.  When Kid Chris makes the big announcement at 5 o'clock.  If you're just tuning in, we're down here in Philly for the ONA Travel and Virus Comedy  Show, the last date on the tour, Saturday at the Tweeter Center in Camden. 
[01:27:00]  Tickets still available.  And we came down early because something's happening with YSP and we want to be part  of that as well.  When are we going to find out?  Oh, boy.  At 5 o'clock today.  Wow.  I can't wait.  It has something to do with something.  I'm so curious.  Yeah.  Where's Dee Schneider?  We were in the middle of our interview with Dee.  Oh, Dee Schneider.  Where's Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Where's Dee Schneider?  Where's Jimmy?  What's your name again? 
[01:27:30]  I forgot.  We met on the radio last week or two weeks ago.  It's Michaela.  Michaela.  So your name was Michael beforehand?  Right?  Was it?  That's very good.  Yeah.  But why when you guys...  I would just completely change my name.  Thank you.  Why?  I am.  I'm in the process right now.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  Wow.  Keep that voice a little feminine.  It's like, hey, I am, you son of a bitch.  Don't make my Navy come out.  Can I sit down for a minute?  Sure.  I was never in the Navy. 
[01:28:00]  I wasn't in the seaman.  Oh.  Oh.  I get it.  That's wonderful there.  I like the Marine Bulldogs.  So you were Michael and now you're Michaela.  What?  Michaela.  Michaela.  Michaela.  Michaela.  Why not just like Tiffany?  Yeah.  Mercedes.  Like something like...  Like I would have to go with Antoinette.  Yeah.  Nah, that's just like stupid.  Yeah.  Stupid.  I mean, like, all right.  Yeah.  Anthony, Antoinette. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  It makes sense.  But I wouldn't want to be called Antoinette.  I would have went with names like...  What's wrong with like Julie?  Nah, she's...  Even if your name is like Michael.  You don't have to get something that sounds like Michael.  Yeah, but it goes with my real last name, the full version.  Well, born...  Because I'm Greek.  You're...  Of course you are.  I am Greek.  Wait, so you were born a Michael and now she needs a new... 
[01:29:00]  I'm thinking of Helen.  But there's controversy about how I was born.  Or Gertrude.  Controversy of how you were born?  Yes.  What happened?  Well, I was adopted by two great parents, but I was impacted...  Not that great.  You were what?  Believe me, he's still looking for the receipt.  So wait...  I was adopted.  Oh, you are adopted.  Oh, okay.  Yes, and he's still looking for the receipt, my poor father.  So wait, wait, wait.  You decided...  When did you realize that you were transsexual?  Well, I was like in fifth grade.  Fifth grade? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I was in fifth grade, nursery school.  Wait.  Nursery school.  They love how you talk.  Fifth grade or nursery school?  They're imitating.  That's like elementary school.  I'm sorry.  I mean, when I was five years old in nursery school...  Oh, five years old in nursery school...  Yes.  ...you kind of knew.  Well, I get people in the other room talking, you know?  Was that it?  That's right.  You were able to drink your bottle and talk at the same time?  A little nervous, you know?  Carry an extra bottle.  No hands.  Hey, was either one of your parents disappointed or whatever when you wanted to go through a 
[01:30:00]  surgery?  Was there a problem?  I mean, there's the old joke about the father being disappointed.  No.  When I saw my dad and I just like wrote...  The short version is I told my father about everything, let him read the medical reports  and all that.  He turned around and looked at me and says, well, you ain't told me anything I haven't  known in the last 30 years.  Oh, really?  No surprise there.  Well, no.  They knew I was XXY chromosome and that my boys had to be dropped.  I was impacted and...  Impacted?  Yeah, they were up...  Really?  Yeah.  They don't have any K-Opectate for that?  Yeah.  How about jumping jacks? 
[01:30:30]  More or less, the boys didn't drop into the bag, okay?  And that's basically what it was.  And they said, well, just promote boy things and give it the hormone shots and everything  should be fine.  And they told me that I was getting allergy shots when the whole time I was getting hormones  shots.  Jesus.  That's why I was a good swimmer.  I was on roids when I was like nine, you know?  Doing a 25 butterfly in 17 seconds flat.  Wait, they told you...  I wasn't in the Cheerios.  They told you it was for allergies?  Yeah.  I'm going to a children's hospital and getting an allergy shot. 
[01:31:00]  Here I'm doing roids, you know?  Nine.  Half out of my mind.  Because they were trying to get you to be what?  A boy.  A boy.  Uh-huh.  And that didn't pan out.  But you look like a boy.  Oh, son of a...  Smooth talker you are, Ope.  You have to go...  What?  Oh, my God.  That's insulting.  You're saying that she's not...  A little more surgery needs to happen.  And stop lifting weights.  You know, your arms are...  You got guy arms.  I was telling the cop outside.  I was 235 pounds three years ago.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, I was taking widge then. 
[01:31:30]  I was like trying to masculine myself, but I can't live a lie.  I was like trying to commit suicide, getting drunk out of my mind.  None of our listeners can kill themselves.  Yeah, we need every listener we can get.  What's wrong with these people?  Sit down.  I'm a suicide failure.  Look what you ended up with.  Me this morning.  No, wait.  You can't even do suicide right.  I've read many books, but I guess I didn't understand the print.  What about the breasts?  Are those naturally yours through hormones? 
[01:32:00]  My boobs?  We refer to them around here as noobs.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Do we get to check anything out?  Oh, not bad.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  I'm trying to figure that out.  What is it?  Actually, you know what?  Not bad.  It's not bad.  Not at all.  I've got to be honest.  Is that through hormones?  That's all I agree with hormones.  I didn't get implants yet.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  I want to be the guy who goes, honestly, I'm with Jimmy. 
[01:32:30]  You want to see both of them?  Of course I do.  Yeah, I've got to say.  We're propping them up, though.  That's weird that hormones.  I'm a 38 bae.  Small bae.  Just do that kind of thing.  That's a little bizarre.  Yeah.  Why?  It's like, goodbye, boys.  Hello, girls.  I've got to say, though.  Let's just say this.  I'm impressed.  Whereas it looks like a bald man with a plunger on his head.  That's kind of like the way I like them.  So I have to say very nice.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, maybe a love connection here. 
[01:33:00]  So do I look like?  No.  Do I look better than most of the trainees you've seen?  No.  I mean, I...  Not to knock you, but...  Thanks.  I'm leaving, then.  No, no, no.  You look lovely, but...  You've got a ways to go.  Let's be honest here.  I'm only...  I'm only a year and a half into it.  But you're not...  You've just got a ways to go.  So a year and a half in.  Steve, are you doing your own show in there, or what?  Yes.  He's saying, I really understand the whole thing where you're, like, really not sure about 
[01:33:30]  yourself.  I'm a woman trapped in a man's body.  It's not like that.  No?  I mean, like, everybody, like, batches trainees.  I mean, you don't understand what it's like trying to grow up, and then, you know, like  when the Sears catalog comes.  Yeah.  And it's like, you guys, they can't wait to get in, you know, they're trying to rub one  out.  Me, I'm like, you know, I wish I could wear that.  I wish I looked like her.  Really?  Yeah.  It's like, what am I supposed to do with that?  And what about sexually?  What were you attracted to?  I was only with a woman to be with a woman. 
[01:34:00]  Wait, because you kind of liked her body?  I liked her junk.  Better than I liked mine, so.  See, this is the odd thing.  She was there, but I was more into it.  Wait, so, do you like women now?  What do you like?  I've had a few friends of mine that I've known for a while.  So, you're kind of like a transvestite with lesbian tendencies.  See, you guys transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  Yeah.  Please, Anthony.  With, yeah, with lesbian tendencies.  I guess I'm going more towards the boys now, more with the girls now.  I don't do girls as much as I do with the boys now. 
[01:34:30]  Now, guys, what kind of guys?  Straight guys.  How do you get them?  These are straight guys.  No.  Straight guys.  These are straight guys that I've known, like, from growing up.  And it's like, you'd be surprised how many of them are coming out of the woodwork.  Wait a minute.  If a guy knew you growing up.  Yes.  Now, we've all had tranny indiscretions.  Can I agree with everyone in the room?  We've all had a few.  Of course we have.  Can we agree with everyone in the room?  We've all had our fun.  Minus a few.  I don't recall.  Right.  Please. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we need hypnosis, because I can't remember.  Bring that out.  Not a one.  We've all had, let's just say this.  How about you, Pat?  A bed full.  No.  Let's say this.  We've all had a garbage truck of tranny indiscretions.  I never did.  Look at that.  No, what I'm saying is, but people coming out of the woodwork who knew you as a guy,  that's a little odd.  Like, I could never picture.  How do you think I feel when I'm going down on them?  Well, that's what it sounds like, too. 
[01:35:30]  That happened.  Well, all right.  She tried to be clean.  Basically, it was, how do you think I feel when performing treats?  Right.  Yeah, that's good enough.  And you have nothing down below now, right?  The boys are gone.  I just got the little guy.  But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You've got to go to our message board.  You've got to go to the kids' show message board.  There's pictures of it.  Hold on.  Really?  There's pictures of it on the kids' show message board.  Wait, so you'll show us?  If you want me to.  Of course we do. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, yeah, if you want me to.  Look at him.  He looks like he's ready to get served a full course meal over here.  You look like you're getting prime rib or something.  So out of the three things.  Believe me, it's turkey neck.  Out of the three things that are normally where they're supposed to be, you are left  with one.  The matching pair of what we're talking about is gone.  Right.  So why?  Why not?  Like, why don't you go for the full? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, because they've got to shape that into something new.  They need everything they, they need all the skin and everything down there to make it  into, you know, why don't they do that?  Why do they remit the boys?  Because.  No, no, no.  Why haven't they finished the operation?  Because it's going to cost $20,000.  I'm trying to raise the money.  Oh, okay.  It's a financial.  Which means it's a good job where I can get a good financial pay, but.  Oh, you're not finished yet.  No, but when you.  I plan on going to Atlantic City.  But when they take the testicles away, when they take the boys away, you don't produce 
[01:37:00]  testosterone and it makes the hormones work better.  Oh, okay.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance, we're remodeling?  No, it doesn't say on the good.  I was a good one, Jimmy.  You mean like on the construction?  It was scaffolding down there.  This ride is closed.  Yeah, I got little midgets with hard hats when I go to sleep, you know what I mean?  With a jackhammer.  Show Jimmy.  Show the whole crew.  I don't care.  It's not going to surprise me.  All right.  And it's got no, um.  Oh my.  Why?  Why doesn't this?  I don't care. 
[01:37:30]  I don't care.  Why are you shy?  Wait, there's.  But it's nothing.  Oh, I see.  It looks like.  Those are going to be.  Holy jeez.  You put that.  Whoa.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Reach around, Steve.  Whoa.  Reach around, Steve.  Steve, get your face out of there, Steve.  Wait a minute.  That almost looks like something.  Wow.  Yes, it looks like.  It almost looks like something.  It looks like Greedo from Star Wars. 
[01:38:00]  But yeah, no, it's.  Somebody's going to have to open the door for me.  Wait, the door's not open yet?  No, I can't touch nothing.  No, no.  See, she's being cordial.  Oh, I don't care who cares.  Unless somebody's got a handy wipes.  I wouldn't.  No, when she said someone has to open the door for me, I'm thinking it's another operation  that needs to be done.  No, no.  That was.  That was.  I thought she'd be polite.  That was actually scientifically very interesting.  Yeah.  It was extremely interesting. 
[01:38:30]  Because there's a way.  It almost looks like.  To make.  What it's supposed to look like.  If you were.  She has devised this way of taking whatever's left and making it completely disappear and  just having whatever is left over to look like the other sex's anatomy.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what's going on.  Jimmy, what do you think?  Well, you know, it's. 
[01:39:00]  You can see she's in.  She's getting there.  But there's more work to be done.  I mean.  I thought it would look horrific.  It's.  No.  It.  It's interesting.  Yeah.  It kind of looks like.  Look, let's be honest.  The full reassignment surgery, I suppose they have to.  Whatever they have to do with the penis.  That's what they have to do.  They have to say it.  That's what they have to do.  They have to reconstruct and turn it into.  It's changing phone numbers over there.  You know.  So she is not ready. 
[01:39:30]  She's not been completely surgically altered.  But it was odd to see in that form where you're.  What it's going to be.  Yeah.  Because.  You can kind of tell where it's going.  Yeah.  It's like when you're building something and you just kind of pile it up to see what it's  going to look like.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it just falls down and stuff.  But you got to get that advanced look at what it's going to look like.  By the way, it's got to be noted.  We're all watching you pick your nose out there at the O&A Cafe.  Look at that fat guy. 
[01:40:00]  He needs a snack.  Was he eating it?  Yeah.  Was he?  Wait, no, no.  Let's go.  Fat boy.  Let me see your moves.  Let him defend yourself.  Come on, fat boy.  Let me see your moves.  Wait, the guy with the blue shirt.  Come on.  Defend yourself.  Come here.  You can defend yourself.  You're the one that's been picking your nose all morning.  We all know.  He looks like he hasn't missed a meal, Jimmy.  Everybody knows in the room.  We know in here.  Yeah.  It's when you're on camera and you're on the front row.  You probably should have been in the back row if you were going to dig in to your nose like  that.  Yum, yum.  Eat him up.  Yum.  No.  Guy in blue. 
[01:40:30]  You really have been picking.  No, I haven't.  No, dude.  Let's go to the videotape.  Do we have video?  I swear.  Hey, who in that room has noticed he's been picking his nose?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  A few people.  There you go.  A few people have noticed.  All right.  Jesus.  So, where's the foot fetish guy?  Jumped out the window.  That's very funny.  And the dummy.  He's playing his relationship on the first floor.  Foot fetish guy.  How bad do you want to get at the cute girl's feet? 
[01:41:00]  Bad.  Real bad.  Not bad.  Not that bad.  He looks like Jeffrey Dahmer.  Yeah, he has a little Jeffrey Dahmer.  Let's hope he acts like him.  Why?  So, he kills me and you laugh?  Yeah!  Wow.  Wow.  Violence.  That was a surprising reaction.  Do you expect anything else from a Philadelphia crowd?  I don't know.  Hold on, so this guy really wants to get at the cute girl's feet, and we're thinking  you've got to go through...  Michaela's feet.  Yes.  Her, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, 
[01:41:30]  Well, he doesn't know.  He's trying to be polite.  He doesn't know because she's in the middle.  You are in between right now, so...  No, I keep saying that.  I'm going to ask you, excuse me, but did you wipe?  Why?  I don't get...  Oh, it was like a...  Oh, what?  Shut it up.  Oh, no.  It.  Never mind.  Can you...  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll get that, Jim.  Yeah.  Now, being...  I had to throw one in.  Being in between, you can't, like, you can't say he or she. 
[01:42:00]  I prefer Shem.  All right, Shem.  Shem.  You can call me Shimmy.  All right.  By the way, Shem.  Booby Man has the line.  If they have to dump out, they have to dump out.  Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Uh-oh.  He was getting allergy shots because he was allergic to pussy.  I was actually fascinated by this.  Like, how come mine don't look like this?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That's...  All right.  So, uh...  Wow.  We want...  Will you allow this guy to kind of mess with your feet a little bit? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, but my feet look like I was kicking a neighbor's dog and a wall.  That's okay.  That was just your father's hopes and dreams.  That's fine.  Thanks.  Someone did an Ovi laugh in there.  I love it.  I'm sorry, but can I say something?  I mean, everybody's making fun of me in here.  I'm not making fun of me.  That's fine.  No, that's fine.  But, really?  And they call me a freak?  Look at what's on this screen.  They're all freaks in that room.  Nosepicker is...  Especially Nosepicker, especially.  I understand where you're going with this, but...  Yeah, I know.  Don't beat up on a crowd. 
[01:43:00]  You might want to look into a...  I don't...  Oh, I'm getting beat up, so I'll just keep it...  I don't know.  We got the cops outside.  Right.  I don't know if the...  You're not that bad, though.  Not at all.  Yeah, we got the coppers outside.  I think that we can have our friend in there.  It's only a foot.  To lick a man's foot, look, or a transsexual's foot, would I want to do that?  Probably not.  But, again, to get to something I really wanted, the feet of a very sexy street team girl, I  would do it.  It's not a big deal.  It's a foot.  Right.  So, you can live with it. 
[01:43:30]  It's funny.  Foot's a foot.  It's what?  Skin.  Absolutely.  A couple of toenails.  Some cheese.  So, yeah, I think you'll do it, right?  You'll do it.  Do you get to kiss that sexy girl's feet?  I think so.  There you go.  These guys told me to take one for the team, and as long as I say no homo, it's fine.  You're not having sex.  No homo makes it all good in the end.  All right.  Well, what do you want?  Should we do it out there?  In there.  Of course.  Yeah, we should do it.  We should do it in that room.  All right.  We can do it after the break.  Yes.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back.  We'll do that from in there. 
[01:44:00]  So, basically, this guy will go through...  Michaela?  I can't say your name.  You got to change it.  You get to say Shimmy.  Shimmy.  Michaela.  We'll just call him...  Michaela.  Michaela.  Ernest Borgnine.  This guy will mess with Michaela's feet.  Wait a second.  And then get to the cute girl's feet.  This guy's going to lick my feet.  Or just kiss your toes a little.  Not fat booger picker.  Not fat booger picker.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  No, don't worry.  Not brings his own snacks everywhere, guy. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I know.  I'm just reaching out for a granola bar.  I love your confidence.  I'm not going to lick the bottom of him.  Huh?  I'm not going to lick the bottom of him.  All right.  We're going to have limits.  I'm going to throw up.  What will you do with...  Oh, blue shirt's pants were white when he got here.  He's wearing green pants for the audience.  Thank you.  Very good.  It's only because he realized he has boxers.  That's a booger joke, kids.  So what is he going to do?  Lick the feet?  Lick...  Yeah.  Suck the toes.  You know, like he would do if he was enjoying a girl that he found attractive. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  And then the chaser will be the cute girl's feet.  Yes.  Right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  We'll do it next.  Live from Philly.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Live from YSP.  YSP in Philadelphia.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony live from Philly from YSP.  We got Mike from Friday Morning Quarterback in the studio. 
[01:45:30]  FMQB.com.  Hey there, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  A friend of the show.  What do you think's going on, Mike?  Here comes Mike to the microphone.  Get it?  Mike to the microphone.  Mike to the mic.  Wow.  Wow.  Now they know what we go through.  When we go to a new city, they never have it all figured out.  They all had to grab their ears.  You see that?  But the guy in the blue shirt didn't have far to go. 
[01:46:00]  Right from the nose to the ears.  Now he can't hear anything.  All right.  So you hear the rumor, Mike?  Heard the rumor.  We printed it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the Inquirer beat us, though.  Know who's the last to have a clue?  Management.  Yeah.  Because they came up to New York a couple days ago, like, all right, we want to keep this  top secret until Friday afternoon.  And I started laughing.  I'm like, there's no way.  It's already out.  Right.  It's an obvious decision, too. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  New wave.  It's amazing that Philly's going to have new wave.  New wave.  80s new wave coming to Philly.  It's just wonderful.  A lot of flock of seagulls.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Did you have sources that you found out from?  Yeah.  We have friends of, you know, we have sources around the industry.  Don't want to give anybody up for their spot.  Probably somebody who makes sweatshirts in the Philadelphia area.  Well, that's what I was telling these guys when they came to New York.  The guy that's painting the van isn't going to tell anybody. 
[01:47:00]  But this Dan Gross, obviously, is sleeping with someone at YSP.  People making the promos.  People that got let go.  So, yeah, the fire people usually, you know.  There's just too many sources to try to keep something like the secret.  Yeah.  If I got the boot, I'm not going to be like, well, I should keep the secret.  I should be a good guy.  And Anthony's not helping the secret by wearing a 94 WISP, the rock station sweatshirt.  I was cold.  But like we said earlier, the rock could be anything.  Sure. 
[01:47:30]  What is that sound effect in the background?  I hear it, too.  I hear it.  It sounds like when I play Half-Life and I trip the alarm and the guard goes, hey, you stop.  And then goes, hmm, must have been the wind.  Love video games.  All right.  Are we going to go in the other room and have some feet sucking?  That a boil.  All right.  Yes.  We are going to, this gentleman wants to suck on one of the lovely girls that work here on  her lovely feet.  Okay.  But, of course, we've got to throw a hurdle up before he can do that. 
[01:48:00]  Actually, a hymnal.  A hymnal.  Jimmy's so damn clever.  All right.  Why don't we put the show on hold and we'll be back on in seconds as we walk down the hall.  We'll be putting it on hold.  What?  Play a rock song.  What?  And for 30 seconds?  Why would we do that?  We could play something from the Ramones.  See, because they have a lot of short songs.  All right.  Here's your hold music. 
[01:48:30]  We'll be back in a second.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you. 
[01:49:00]  Thank you. 
[01:49:30]  Here's the first example of the kind of music you're going to hear on YSP.  Easy listening with YSP.  You have been picking your nose the whole time, right?  Dude, no, no, no, no, no.  You were itching it?  You were itching?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, he's saying you want you to...  I was just itching my nose, that's all.  Really?  Yeah, that's it.  So it kind of itched from above your lips into somewhere in the middle of the brain. 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  We got a nice crowd here.  So where's the foot-licking guy?  It's you, right?  Yeah, there he is.  Who does he look like?  There's a couple of people.  Richard Speck?  The shaved head.  Yeah, Jeffrey Dahmer was brought up before, but now you need...  Jack Tripper.  Jack Tripper.  All right, where's the cute intern slash street teamer?  There she is. 
[01:50:30]  There you are with the really nice feet.  Yeah, I guess.  No, they are nice feet.  She's nervous because they're all sweaty and stuff, so that's fine.  I'm a little nervous.  A little nervous, a little sweaty.  All right, sit down in the chair.  So, dude, you totally dig these feet, right?  She's very sexy.  You like those?  She's got very nice eyes.  Yes.  That's like a sexual thing to you, though, the feet?  Like, you're looking at that thinking, wow.  That's not the first thing I look at, but...  No?  No, but you got to look at her, just, you know, see if... 
[01:51:00]  And then you look at her feet and go, okay, now I'm ready to go with the feet.  I'm a big leg man.  Yeah.  And, of course, legs...  Why are you saying she's got big legs?  I understand what you mean, sir.  Birthing hips.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Birthing.  And your baby's going to be very happy with those.  Yeah.  All right, where's the shim?  She's right there.  Right there.  From the Kid Kush show.  This is the present that Kid Chris gave us today. 
[01:51:30]  I guess he hates us.  Yeah.  And you got old lady shoes on.  What are you talking about?  The brand now.  They look like old lady shoes, though.  You're looking good, girl.  Sorry.  There you go.  Looking good, girl.  This is...  You heard it here.  This is wonderful.  Okay.  Now, we haven't seen she's feet. 
[01:52:00]  I'm telling you, I look like I was kicking bricks in the backyard.  Well, let's just get a little look.  That's all right.  Her feet are pretty.  Well, let's see.  Put your foot on the floor.  Those are men's feet.  Those are fine.  Put your foot flat on the floor.  Let's see it.  It's fine.  I just need, like, a paint job.  That's fine.  It's not that bad.  A paint job.  That, uh...  Dude, what are you, um...  What are you...  Does he have a mic? 
[01:52:30]  Wait a second.  He went down the foot.  What?  They're not that bad.  Let's see.  Yeah, so what?  Why are you wiping scabs?  What is that scab?  No, don't wipe it.  Leave it alone.  That's when I got beat up.  I got beat up by some guy.  What happened?  He cleaned the street up with me.  That's what he did.  Did he beat you up?  Yeah.  Why?  Intolerant?  Because I mouthed off to his girlfriend.  Why would you do that?  Because she was bitching about me trying to, like, run into her car or something, yada, yada, yada, 
[01:53:00]  and the guy came over and punched me in the face.  Do you drink a lot?  I was drinking at the time.  Yeah, I assume you probably would be hammered.  I called her to see you next Tuesday, and he...  Ah, boy.  Uh-huh.  So you called her the A-bomb of words, and there was a problem.  Mine first.  No, see, the fun is that he gets to lick your pretty feet.  Why do you have to lick her feet after you lick her feet?  Nah, it doesn't work that way.  He has to go through the ugly feet to get to the cute feet.  You won't.  There's no transfer.  Yeah, he went Listerine himself. 
[01:53:30]  No Listerine for him.  All right.  All right.  Use this side of your tongue a little bit.  Yeah, it'll be fine.  It's only a foot.  All right, here we go.  So, uh...  No.  Feet's not.  No.  Are you ready for this, sir?  Come on over here.  This is lost.  This is making...  I don't think I'll ever be ready for this.  All right.  What are you going to do to the ugly feet?  Yeah.  I'll kiss him.  All right, kiss him.  We don't want...  We don't want this quick little thing.  We need you to work this like you work a beautiful foot. 
[01:54:00]  Grab that heel.  Grab the...  Grab it.  Hold on.  Stop wiping it.  It's fine.  They're new shoes.  My feet were sweating.  And go in and gently kiss and rub and then start licking between the toes.  Spend some time with that foot.  And when we realize you did a good job, then you get to move on to the cute feet.  Then you get to move on to a real woman's foot.  That's right.  Literally.  Well, don't be shy. 
[01:54:30]  Those...  Please.  This guy's going to cut his, like, lips and...  No, he won't.  Toenails.  What?  What's the problem?  I'm not going near the bottom of the feet.  Why not?  What's wrong?  That's not a shoe.  It's just a shoe.  It has calluses.  Shut up.  I told you I didn't get a pedicure in the last two weeks.  All right.  Chill out, man.  Come on.  They're fine.  Relax, man.  What's...  All right.  All right.  This is, like, gross to me now. 
[01:55:00]  You're not the only one.  Yeah.  Don't, uh...  I didn't expect this.  I'm sorry, Cuzz.  I didn't expect this, Cuzz.  Cuzz?  Cuzz.  Oh, wow.  It makes it even hotter.  Yeah.  Suck my feet, Cuzz.  Just pretend it's a Bruno's cheesesteak in South Philly, all right?  I like the local reference.  Yes.  But dirtier.  I can close my eyes and say no show-mo.  Come on.  Tina's a bitchy rat.  No show-mo.  No show-mo.  And, dude, dude, but you've got to treat it just as nicely as you're going to treat her feet. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, God.  So, we're talking, be very sensual.  Don't worry about all the cameras, by the way.  No one cares.  No one cares.  It's not like they'll be showing it to anybody.  Just grab Dean Wormer's wife's foot and suck away.  Love, take one for the team and be a hero, will you?  Hero.  Hero.  Hero.  There he goes. 
[01:56:00]  He's now cupping the heel, and he's licking the instep.  Put that.  Now, you don't want to lick the bottom.  Hold on.  I like the fact that you started, but I want that big toe kissed gently and tenderly.  Kiss that big toe.  It's gross.  All right.  You've got to stay there longer for the photo ops.  And then we need your tongue to go between the toes.  That's what we need. 
[01:56:30]  I'm sweating now.  So what?  Come on.  Yeah.  It's a man.  Don't lie.  Oh, good.  Get him there.  Oh, God.  I can't watch.  Suck that toe.  No.  Come on.  Keep longer.  Come on.  Get in there.  You're not going to spin.  Suck it.  There you go.  Keep going.  Suck that toe.  Suck those toes.  Dude.  Suck those toes.  Suck it.  Yeah.  Is he done?  Suck those toes.  Is he done?  Suck the rest of them. 
[01:57:00]  Just play our foot like a harmonica.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No harmonica.  It's a harmonica.  I love the reaction of the shim because now she knows how we all feel today.  Wow.  That was so wrong.  Oh, wow.  Now, sir, how did that feel?  The eyes were watering.  What's the difference?  Now, you being a foot fetish, you've had a lot of girls' feet in your mouth. 
[01:57:30]  Was there a difference?  I never had a guy's foot in my mouth.  Yeah, but what's the difference between the shim here and who you've been with?  The skin was a little drier.  The skin was drier.  And the hair.  A little hair on the knuckles.  The litter wasn't.  Jackass.  No hair on the knuckles.  And when you look up, you see testicles.  Testicles.  See?  All right. 
[01:58:00]  Everyone just got a show.  I didn't see that.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That's hysterical.  The security.  Talk to him.  Oh, bro.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, bro.  He couldn't hack it.  We just lost a six foot four security guard.  Where'd he go?  Come on.  Bring him back in here, Jimmy.  Talk to this guy.  Damn.  Hold on.  We just lost a six foot four security guard.  Why?  What happened, man?  Is he upset? 
[01:58:30]  He's not permitted?  Yeah, yeah.  I can't really talk, I bet.  Oh, okay.  They make rules for security guards.  Oh, really?  It's like, I understand that, but man.  What a reaction.  That's it.  Yeah.  What?  You want to wow?  He wants to show her boobs.  Would you guys like to see the shims?  Yeah, why don't you show everybody?  You can look her.  Oh, wow.  No, no.  Stand up.  Stand up.  All right.  Here we go.  Wow.  There you go.  Turn around and show the gang. 
[01:59:00]  That's good.  All it's missing is a tattoo of an anchor.  All right.  Now, did everybody get a look?  Did you really show?  Did you show everything before or did you just kind of show a little bit?  Because the trick you showed us was actually impressive.  Yeah, very impressive.  Yeah.  Show.  Who cares?  It's actually medical.  It's something that you're doing.  Who knew you were a puppeteer?  It was more scientific than sexual.  It's something you're doing that.  Yeah.  Why don't you give them a quick look?  I don't know what kind of guys.  Show people how you do it. 
[01:59:30]  There you go, guys.  I feel like I'm in first grade for show and tell.  All right.  I feel like you are, too, because I'm telling you to pull your...  All right.  What do I do?  Just show everybody what you showed us.  That's great.  It's like the first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  Not bad.  I feel like I'm telling you to kill your love.  Hey.  Okay. 
[02:00:00]  Hey.  That cute girl.  Why the reaction?  Come here.  Talk to Jimmy.  Come here, miss.  Yeah.  You're the...  Yeah, the cute girl.  This cute girl.  Yeah, this cute girl.  Yeah, this...  Hi.  What was the reaction she had?  She had her hands over her mouth.  I think not.  Did you ever...  What do you think of that?  I was staring at it.  What do you think?  It was...  It wasn't bad.  Being a woman...  She had to shove the penis, kind of, in.  Well, being a woman and owning one, what do you think the chances are of, you know, smacking 
[02:00:30]  that into shape with a sledgehammer and some Bondo?  It's disgusting.  It makes a lot of music, but I don't know.  You just don't know?  That is odd, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, Britney Spears looked like that when the...  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Actually, yes.  The Britney Spears.  All right.  See?  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  Now we got to give this guy the treat for going through the shim. 
[02:01:00]  That's right.  Michaela, get that skirt back up.  All right.  Well, now you get...  This is the boring part of the bit, by the way.  Now you get to...  Yeah.  Now you actually got the payoff.  Yes.  No one cares now.  No.  Take your shoe off.  I think it's nice.  He gets...  She has beautiful feet.  She actually does.  Danny, why don't you move so Keith Partridge's hair can get a picture?  I'm sweating because I'm nervous.  They're nice and nice.  They're okay. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, God.  Lift your arms up, dude.  Wow.  All right.  Who wants to lick his armpits for tickets?  I will.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Now, what do you like about the foot and the leg?  You're really rolling her pant leg up, dude.  Where are you going with this?  Exactly.  How far...  The legs are smooth.  You did?  Good.  So you like her leg?  Yep.  It's nice and smooth.  This part, right?  The bottom of her foot.  What's the matter?  Problem?  That's really nice. 
[02:02:00]  You like that?  He likes the arch.  The arch.  You like the arch.  What about the arch?  The whole foot fetish thing is when you put the two arches together.  Yeah.  Oh, and it makes...  And then you actually use the...  It looks like...  Holy jeez.  Here's what you do.  You put the arches together, and it looks like what the rest of us just like.  Oh, put...  Yeah, just take that two of them and put them together and let them see.  Let them just see it.  Yeah, put the arches together.  Look at them freaking out.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Oh.  That's a big vagina. 
[02:02:30]  She has nice arches.  He's digging that.  All right, so she put the arches together.  And it looks like you've had a lot of kids.  Once the arches are together, yeah.  Yeah.  Happy kids, right?  Happy kids, because of the big boobies.  So you want to just pick up that foot and show us how you'd work?  Oh, wow.  He grabbed it.  Oh, you animal.  Go get them, tiger.  Now he's going to lick the arch.  Oh, wow.  All right, all right.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Oh, it's not going to hurt.  It's just only a foot.  It feels good, right?  Oh, somehow he likes this a little more.  It feels good. 
[02:03:00]  It's not bad.  Thank you.  That was awesome.  I've had my...  Dude, yeah.  I took my foot longer than it hurt.  Yeah, he did.  Do it again.  It feels good, right?  I love the reaction.  Go ahead.  It's not bad.  No, no, no.  Same foot.  Same foot.  Only one foot.  Only the left foot.  It's not bad.  Hey, I had to take it.  Then you're too.  Yeah, I'll have.  Look at that.  Thank you.  You like it?  She's like, thank you.  Thank you very much.  I don't know.  I like it better when the women appreciate it.  Well, she's a little nervous.  I'm so appreciating that.  She actually likes it more than you think she does, but she's nervous.  I think it's really nice of you. 
[02:03:30]  How about this?  I'm working for you.  Would you let him on your left foot, on your left foot, just like, nothing crazy, just  like, you want to suck the toes, right?  Let's be honest.  No, how about licking under them?  You want to lick the toes?  You don't have to suck them.  Just lick them.  I can lick the top.  All right, lick the top.  He likes the top.  Lick the top.  All right.  I love the reaction.  Oh, look at that.  Lick them.  What are you doing?  You're trying to stamp, you idiot.  Awesome.  It's supposed to be sensual.  I know it is, but you're just like, ugh.  I'm getting really into it.  I like when the women, like, like this, or they're knocked out. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  I like when there's a toe tag on this.  All right.  So where's the other foot fetish guy?  Where's the other foot fetish guy?  There's another one.  Yeah, I just want to show him.  He doesn't have to do anything.  Come here.  Come here.  I just want to show him.  He doesn't have to do anything.  I just want to ask you an opinion on her feet.  Do you like her feet?  I love feet.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm more of a foot rubber than a licker.  Are you? 
[02:04:30]  How about this?  Would you let him rub your feet?  He can rub your feet.  How about this?  Could he rub your feet, though?  But he has to lick the left one first.  Oh, yeah.  He would have to rub.  Yeah.  Could he?  Why can't he be a leg fetish guy?  Why?  I think he's got a nice, smooth leg style.  You've got nice, smooth legs.  Smooth scabs.  Jeez.  All right.  It's because I walked into that TV screen on the studio.  What's the excuse for the face? 
[02:05:00]  Sorry.  It was too easy.  Uncomfortable for everybody now.  I think we have to take a break.  Are we going to continue on YSP today?  I think we are, yeah?  Yeah, we'll go for YSP.  What time is it?  Sure.  Oh, 5 to 9?  All right.  So we've got to say goodbye to some of our affiliates.  We're going to continue on YSP and on XM Satellite Radio.  All right?  Don't go anywhere.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Philly.  We'll be back in just a bit.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show live from WYSP Studios in Philadelphia.  Opie and Anthony live from Philly today.  That was pretty gross, huh?  Uh, yeah.  I think we're still on in New York.  I'm not sure.  Who knows?  I know we're on XM.  I know we're live in Philly.  Maybe live in New York.  Maybe live in Boston.  We don't know.  We have the weirdest show.  Yeah.  We don't know when we're on. 
[02:06:00]  What other radio show is on and has no idea if they're on whatever station?  The listeners know when we're on.  Well, yeah.  What just happened in there?  Well, did you guys like the foot fetish thing or what?  Yeah.  It was all right, huh?  Are there any girls in there flashing?  Yeah, what's up with that?  It's just nice to have girls around.  There's a couple.  There's a few cute girls in there today. 
[02:06:30]  They all have boyfriends, though.  Why would a single girl that's cute want to come down and hang out?  Yes, the girl in the purple.  Will you flash?  Ah, she turned around.  No, she just touched the top of her shirt.  Would you flash, miss?  Please?  You don't have to, but...  What?  What did she say?  Wait, do we have a microphone in there for her?  No, I want to go check out her cameras.  Your face isn't in it.  Don't worry.  Your face isn't in it. 
[02:07:00]  They're taunting her.  She's basically saying she would flash if they would all put down their cameras.  Hold on.  Put down your cameras, you dumbbells.  Only a pair of breasts.  That's going to happen.  Hold on, miss.  We're getting you a mic.  Don't photograph her if she doesn't want to be photographed.  Yeah, that's...  What are they laughing at?  Danny came running.  Danny came running.  All right.  All right.  Well, Danny, bring her up to the front here by the camera.  By the boy we can see her.  All right.  We are on live in New York.  That's cool.  Okay.  Thank you, Tom. 
[02:07:30]  Thanks, Tom.  Now, Danny's in the room.  He's got her...  What's your name, miss?  Sarah.  Hi, Sarah.  Is your boyfriend mad?  Are you going to do this?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Who's the guy you're with?  Oh, a single girlfriend.  Is it a friend?  I'm sorry?  Is it a friend?  I don't know.  No, I say you're with a guy.  Is it just your friend?  No, I'm by myself.  Oh, good.  I'm actually filling up.  Could you just give us a peek, if you don't mind?  Oh, could you just give them a peek?  But guys, respect to us.  Just don't take a picture. 
[02:08:00]  No, that's okay.  And here you go.  Yeah, see?  Very nice.  That's the reaction of wow every single time.  There you go.  People love it.  Very nice.  Wait.  Sweetheart.  Come on again.  What's your name?  Do over.  My name?  Yeah.  Sarah.  Sarah, how come you don't have a guy?  Why no boyfriend?  You're very lovely, a good body.  Bitch.  I don't know.  You don't know?  Do you go out a lot or no?  Not really that much.  You just stay home? 
[02:08:30]  What do you do?  I go every once in a while.  Stay home and pray in the closet with mama.  I could see your dirty pillars.  So when was the last time you had a boyfriend?  A while.  I don't know.  How old are you?  21.  Oh, wow.  Are you interested in somebody?  I like the sky.  Yeah.  Not really.  All right.  Let's. 
[02:09:00]  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's something going on here.  Let's state the obvious.  Which uncle touched you when you were younger?  Jeez, Ope.  She might not have been it.  21.  She's very cute.  No boyfriend.  It doesn't sound like she's had one for a while.  Girls?  No.  No girls.  Have you been sexually active?  I have.  Oh, okay.  I just thought maybe, you know, virgin thing going on there.  Strict upbringing?  No.  No?  Do you have a father? 
[02:09:30]  My father died.  That's okay.  So did mine.  Who cares?  Hey.  Let's drink to our dead fathers.  Okay.  She's a nice girl.  Yeah.  That could.  Want to see me make a girl cry?  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  I wouldn't do that to her.  How'd your father die?  Was it sad?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  Was it sudden?  No.  Oh, the long protracted disease?  Yeah.  What happened?  What did he have?  That's horrible.  He had a whole litany of things.  He had hepatitis C.  Oh, okay.  Was he a drug abuser?  Jesus.  Okay. 
[02:10:30]  How'd your parents die?  Was he a drug addict?  Was he a drug addict to have hep C?  No.  He drank.  Oh, he drank.  Okay.  So he got like maybe cirrhosis of the liver.  Yeah.  And other things that go along with drinking too much.  Yeah.  And all.  So you didn't really get the attention from daddy that you really needed.  And that kind of screws you up as a young woman. 
[02:11:00]  Not a good guy.  It does a little bit.  I mean, you got it.  What?  He was a good guy?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  I was just waiting.  He was that laugh again.  Was he?  Was he?  No.  Was he hammered a lot?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  What nationality are you?  Irish.  Oh, wow.  That's really busting apart those stereotypes.  Irish and what else?  Irish and what else?  I'm sorry? 
[02:11:30]  Irish and what else?  I can't hear you.  Just Irish?  Irish, French, German.  A little bit of everything.  You're European.  Yeah.  You're like white.  Yeah.  European.  Cool.  A real colonizer.  Yeah.  I just, I just, like, I'm trying to figure this out.  Because she didn't have a bad, like, father thing.  Why no boyfriend?  Let's get into this.  Yeah.  Did a guy do you wrong?  No.  I mean, no.  I have, like, a, somebody's sort of a boyfriend, but we're not really dating. 
[02:12:00]  He's a guy that will call you when he's been drinking.  No, no, no.  Just a booty call?  Uh, no.  No, no.  More than that, I guess.  You're friends with benefits?  Yeah.  He's a rapist.  What is it?  Is he married?  Married guy?  No, no.  He's not married.  Has a girlfriend, though, right?  No.  You work with him?  Nope.  We've just known each other for a long time.  Good friends. 
[02:12:30]  Through what?  School?  Uh, no.  Well, I've known him since high school.  You talk like Roland.  I'm kind of nervous.  Yeah, you're pretty nervous.  Yeah, she's very nervous.  Why are you nervous?  I don't, because I'm on the radio.  I don't know.  I kind of know what's on the spot.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We put her on the spot.  Which you should have.  I was just saying, because you're not the type of girl that shouldn't.  Like, you should have a boyfriend.  Or something.  Or you should, you know, have some relationship story. 
[02:13:00]  Uh, no.  Alright, when's the last time you banged your head on a steering wheel?  I respect that.  I'm not being disrespectful.  Um.  Yeah.  Yesterday?  Not on a steering wheel, but.  Um, what'd you, no, no.  When's the last, are you, uh, like, when's the last time you had sex?  Uh, yesterday.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Well.  With this guy?  Uh, yeah.  Oh.  Well, that is a little more than just a pal. 
[02:13:30]  Well, I mean, yeah.  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah.  Do you guys, uh, have sex a lot?  Um, not really.  Not really?  How often would you say?  Um.  Ah, jeez.  I don't know.  How did, how did, well, how did last night come about?  Just hanging out.  Yeah, well, you're just hanging out, and then all of a sudden, who makes the move?  I think it was me.  You made the move?  Yeah.  What did you do?  Yeah, what happened? 
[02:14:00]  Um.  Lay out the scene for us.  Um.  I don't know if people I know are listening.  That's all right.  It's only easy talking.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  We all have sex.  Yeah.  He was at the computer.  I just leaned over.  He was at the computer.  What was he doing?  Well, he was on the computer, and I got out of the shower.  Oh, you get out of the shower, so.  What was he looking at on the computer?  Uh, he was probably doing work.  Oh, yeah.  Doing work.  I'm sure.  Now, why were you there, and why was he there?  It's what he was looking at before you walked out of the shower. 
[02:14:30]  Exactly.  Did you hear him close the window real quick, and you heard German and a barking dog?  Just doing some work, honey.  Do you, uh, do you room together?  Um, no.  So, why was he working, and you showering in the same place?  Um, well, I hang out at his house a lot.  You hang out at his house a lot?  Yeah.  Do you have clothes there?  Um, yes.  Yeah, hanging up in the closet somewhere?  No.  So, you're kind of, this is, dude, you got a boyfriend. 
[02:15:00]  Let me inform you of something.  You have a boyfriend.  Wait.  She's trying to keep her options open.  No, I think the guy won't commit to her.  I think she probably likes him.  Is that it?  No, I kind of won't commit.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Why?  Why?  She's a whore.  Why?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why?  Um, I don't know.  Because men leave her.  They get drunk, and their livers fall out of their asses, and they leave her. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Is that what it is?  No.  You're a little afraid of building a relationship with a man,  because the most important man in your life, Daddy, left you prematurely?  No.  I just, we dated for a while.  I kind of didn't work out.  The guy or your dad?  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  Nothing.  The guy, the guy, it didn't, I can't, I can't hear any.  Good.  Well, it didn't work out with this guy.  You dated, he's your ex-boyfriend.  Mm-hmm.  And you're still friends, and you still kind of hook up once in a while. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  But the relationship didn't work out.  Uh, yeah.  Is he seeing someone else now?  No.  And you're not either?  No.  So, you get out of the shower, he's on the computer, are you in a towel, or nude?  Nude.  You're nude.  And you just kind of lean over, and what, grab his neck?  No.  Oh, you kind of lay your assets on his shoulders?  Uh, face.  Oh, his head?  His face.  That's nice. 
[02:16:30]  Like, hey, I'm trying to work here.  Pretty much, yeah.  And that got some activity going.  That's nice.  That's a hot little story.  You're very sexy.  Thank you.  You know, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, nerve-wracked kind of way.  Would you get with Jimmy if he wasn't, you know, with a girlfriend?  Yeah, what's your type?  Type?  Um, tall, like, dark hair.  So that's a no, she wouldn't.  Really? 
[02:17:00]  Tall, dark hair, like what, the security guys?  No wonder daddy's dead.  I don't necessarily have a type.  I'm a nice guy.  How old?  Are you 21?  I'm perfect.  It's like I'm a couple years older than you.  We could, uh...  Oh, good.  No one laughed at that.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  You need a father figure in your life?  No.  No?  No.  Would you just rub my hog?  But Steve could do that. 
[02:17:30]  Big bear.  Give you a buck.  A buck.  You want to make a buck?  No, thank you.  The hard way.  Do you like Frankenberry cereal?  Uh, no thanks.  What do you mean by that, Jimmy?  Just wondering.  Why would you, uh, pick that cereal?  Jimmy likes Frankenberry, and he's trying to, like, uh, get her, uh, you know, mutual interest  kind of a thing.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's what we were talking about on the way in. 
[02:18:00]  Frankenberry.  How?  But...  Enough.  You're very nice, Gerald.  Thank you very much.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hit on you.  I have a girlfriend.  I'm in love.  Someone is suggesting...  But she could be killed.  Someone is suggesting that you might be a size queen, and that's why you're holding  out for maybe something...  Something like, uh...  Different.  Like a V8 can?  No, that's not...  No?  Okay.  All right.  Anyone else have anything in there?  You have a little... 
[02:18:30]  You have a little kink to you?  Is it straight, like, you know, when, uh, when you...  And this gentleman that was on the computer last night, uh, hit the, uh, sack, uh, is  it...  Is it just straight...  Straight ahead?  Or do you got a little kink?  Will you...  Will you bite a pillow every so often?  Uh, it depends.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Are you dominant or you're submissive girl?  Yeah.  Um, that depends, too.  I don't know.  It depends on my mood.  On your mood?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at her. 
[02:19:00]  She is twitching.  Her hands are going.  She's a little nervous.  A little nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Michael J. Fox has a little tremor.  She's shaking just like him.  All right, well, you did a great job on the air.  Thank you.  I thought I sucked.  No, you didn't, Sarah.  You were nice.  You want Philly's tickets?  Uh, yeah.  How about traveling virus tickets?  I'm already going.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Take care.  Uh, VIP passes to Jimmy's dressing room?  I've got a girlfriend.  I have a girlfriend.  You can come to the meet and greet, though.  I'm sorry? 
[02:19:30]  All right.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  No, but I'm saying, do you want to come to the meet and greet?  Uh, yeah, I'd love to.  So we meet you and we greet you?  Greet you.  It's like a backstage pass.  If you've never seen a meet and greet, watch The Accused.  All right, we'll give her Philly's tickets for tonight's game.  I think we're going to the game tonight?  Yes.  Right?  Yeah, rumor has it.  That'll be cool.  After we go on Kid Chris's show for the big announcement at 5 o'clock. 
[02:20:00]  All right, anyone else with anything before we wrap up this part?  Oh, you got something to say?  She was saying something?  Oh, good.  Sarah?  I was just going to say thank you.  Oh, no problem.  And thank you, sweetheart.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Yeah.  What?  I didn't.  All right.  Sarah.  Hey, Sarah.  Sarah, you didn't answer the question.  Sarah.  Sarah, can you come back to the mic, please? 
[02:20:30]  Please.  Oh, my.  Just for a second.  I'll do it.  What was that?  I didn't hear you.  It's about to.  Just wanted to say thanks. 
[02:21:00]  Thanks for being on the show.  You were good.  You were good.  You could leave now.  Go sit down.  Unless you want to lick the guy in the blue's fingers first.  Wow.  I'm sorry, Sarah.  I'm sure you weren't picking.  You just had an itch.  It happens.  All right.  Listen, I think they're going to take us off of New York radio.  So why don't we take a break here?  Let them say goodbye to us.  And then we'll continue on XM.  And I think we're going to continue live here in Philly on YSP. 
[02:21:30]  Okay.  I think we're down to one commercial radio station in our satellite show now, I think,  if you're keeping track at home.  Who knows?  All right.  So for everybody in New York, have a good weekend.  What day is it?  Weekend.  Have a good weekend.  We'll see you tomorrow.  But have a good weekend, incidentally.  And a good life.  A lot of people start their weekends on a Thursday.  That is true.  I don't know.  We usually come down on a Friday.  But this time we're here early because of the big announcement down here in Philly.  An announcement?  Huh?  I have an idea for Fridays, man.  We should all walk out at the TLA tomorrow like rock stars playing. 
[02:22:00]  We're taking what they're giving because we're working for a living and put our fists up.  We're back!  We're back!  And we're better than ever!  And we're back!  You've got to hear Van Halen do that.  All right.  So we say goodbye to New York and we'll continue from Philly live on YSP after these messages.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:22:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Live from WISP in Philadelphia.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Philly on YSP.  And on, wow, that smell really is bad.  Wow, Jimmy.  Wow.  Stop me in my tracks.  You have really done it, Jimmy.  What happened?  I was standing up and some things happened all of a sudden. 
[02:23:00]  Jimmy, are you pushing out the fear again today?  Are you scared?  Are you scared?  I have a crush on Sarah.  Yeah.  And sometimes when I'm insecure, that's the bravery swelling up.  And all of the insecurity and terror is pushed out of me.  Well, your insecurity and terror stinks.  Yeah, it really does stink.  I wanted to talk to Sarah, but I got really nervous.  Well, here's the deal.  We're live on YSP.  We're on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a big day for YSP.  Can you guys feel the energy in the air? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's right.  I say we have a parade in the streets of Philly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who wants to have a parade today?  They want to take it out to the streets.  Well, here's the problem.  YSP, they were going to fire everybody today.  Well, it's not fire.  Don't say fire.  But they had to fire them yesterday.  Let go.  Because the big news leaked out.  Some really, really good people were let go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we'd still have to make jokes.  So let's acknowledge that there are really, really good broadcasters that are now looking for work. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  Philly was hoping that they could use those guys for another day before they fire them.  Because that's how it works.  Use them.  They use people in this business.  But they had to fire them early.  So they don't know what to do here on YSP for the rest of the day.  Until they could start the thing they're going to be doing.  They didn't have an emergency contingency plan just in case people found out.  No.  So it's us and then nobody until Kid Chris. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  And then Kid Chris makes the official announcement at 5 o'clock.  Whatever that is.  Whatever that announcement's going to be.  Well, they're changing the thing.  It's no longer 94 YSP Talks.  It's going to be YSP Teletypes.  Jimmy, but your song makes sense today.  We're back.  Oh, yeah.  They should play that as the new Van Halen.  And better than ever.  We're back.  So you guys want to have a parade or what?  I say we hit the streets of Philly and get the excitement going. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  Gay rights.  Imagine it's gay rock.  Nothing on that.  That's pretty funny.  Wait, what's going on here?  YSP.  Gay rock?  The room is the final judge.  And they hate it.  Oh, no, all the rainbows have.  They really did hate it.  No walk, remote engineer packed up and went home?  What do you mean?  How did the remote engineer pack up and go home?  What the hell is wrong with this business?  I just found out.  I just found out that the guy who was waiting for us to go into a walkover tore down and left. 
[02:25:30]  He's through.  How about they get him back?  What is he, work two hours a day?  I guess.  Get him back.  All right.  What do you, did we, we said we wanted to do this earlier, right?  This is our thing.  We want to hit the streets with a parade.  This is a big day in Philly.  I told him earlier.  And the guy that's going to like broadcast it for us went home?  Yeah, I told him earlier.  Holy God.  I said, stand by.  I'm not sure what we're doing. 
[02:26:00]  I heard them say something about wanting to go outside.  So just don't pack up yet.  And I just found out he packed up.  So hopefully right now he's on his way back unless he's dead in an accident, which should  be option number two.  So what are we going to do, Steve?  How are we going to do a parade without the guy that's going to broadcast the whole thing?  Yes.  So how much is this business?  With a bullhorn.  All right.  A bullhorn and a cell phone.  And no permit.  Huh?  What are we going to do, Kenny?  Take charge.  Kenny, Kenny, what can we do? 
[02:26:30]  I'm going to see where this guy went.  Uh-oh.  Well, you're going to have to turn that car around.  That's true.  Maybe he can fix your linty collar.  That's what we want to do.  Linty.  Kenny has a linty collar.  We want to do an impromptu parade.  And then people that are hearing us, they could join the parade.  And we'll just be, we're back better than ever.  Oh, we're going to sing Jimmy's Van Halen song?  Yes, the new Van Halen.  And then we'll have people beeping their horns.  It'll be a big day in Philly.  Yeah.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time. 
[02:27:00]  Him and Eddie back to back.  Eddie's kind of balding with half a tongue.  Slab back.  All right, just play.  I need to harmonize.  I just hope someone's taking all these clips of you singing this and makes a song out of it.  I'm sure they are.  Please.  That's another work part right there.  People out there.  Yeah, there's another chorus.  Somebody will be using their Mac and putting that together.  David Lee Roth will be wearing like those leopard pants with the bandanas tied back to back. 
[02:27:30]  They'll go like, we're back.  And their stupid backs touch.  Oh, God.  I'm so embarrassed by hearing this.  And little fat Wolfgang is playing.  Hello.  We've been through changes.  And that's when the video goes to like Wolfgang.  Oh, God.  I hate this.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, what are we going to do?  Do we have an answer yet?  They're finding out where he is and how long it's going to take him to get back and set back up.  Look, look.  Let's be real here.  Let's be real. 
[02:28:00]  Sure.  There ain't no way you're finding the guy, first of all.  Secondly, do you think he's going to be able to set up for a remote broadcast on the street in a matter of minutes?  Yeah, he had it for our walkover.  It doesn't matter.  It's a quick one.  A quick one.  Let's be honest.  Even the people here at YSP don't give a crap.  What?  They don't give a crap.  I think today's a very special day here at YSP.  Oh, boy.  It feels it, doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  I don't see any of certain banners because I ripped them down.  Okay.  I'm wearing a special sweatshirt. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Even though it's 85 in Philly, that's good.  Well, it was cold in here earlier, but Jesus Christ, I'm hot.  We want to do something for the big day here in Philly, so.  Yeah.  Where's Karen?  Karen usually knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  Karen is on a mission.  What's the mission?  Went home with the sound guy.  Yeah, it's her daughter's first day at school, so she's coming.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Wait, first day like ever?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  So who's running this place? 
[02:29:00]  No one.  Wait, I got a joke.  Looks like the inmates have taken over the asylum.  Jimmy.  Wow.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, boy.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oh, wow.  Let me, uh.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  All right.  Let me get this straight.  So no one's here.  No one's here.  The guy that would help us broadcast some kind of crazy parade went left, went home. 
[02:29:30]  So what are we going to do now?  45 minutes.  To get back and set back up.  Where is he?  New York.  He's yawning on one side of a buddy booth.  He's tapping his toe in the bathroom.  Absolutely.  Do we tell him to come back or tell him to?  Tell him to come back.  There is no way.  Come back.  Yes.  We're going to better than.  We, we, uh.  How did the changes happen? 
[02:30:00]  We've been through changes.  With boop, boop of the bass.  Oh, my.  With boop.  With boop, boop.  Jimmy's great.  All right.  So.  Oh, damn.  So the guy just decided on his own to go home.  He may have had another gig to go to.  I'm not really sure.  Karen, who's pretty much in charge, had to leave.  Right.  For her daughter's first day of school.  Kenny's playing pocket pool.  If the guy can't be here for 45 minutes, what time will it be?  Let's see.  10.15.  10.15.  10.15.  We'll round it to 10.15.  By the time he sets up, there's no way. 
[02:30:30]  According to Steve, that's being here and setting up.  Right?  Yes.  Okay.  So he can be set by 10.15.  I mean, what else?  Are we going to do a parade anyway?  That's fine.  10.15's parade.  It's prime parade time.  We all know that.  All right.  I assumed he had 45 minutes to get here.  How about we try a cell phone?  Danny, go outside and call, and let's see if we can get a cell phone to work.  Oh, boy.  Cell phones never work good.  Maybe we can be the one-man parade with Clips on Kenny.  God, I want to know what that sound is. 
[02:31:00]  Hold on.  It's driving me crazy.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Well, the guy that's in charge of that probably went home, too.  It's going, eh.  And what happened to Chris Crocker?  He's got other press to do.  We keep trying.  That is such a load of crap.  That little pansy.  The Britney Spears guy.  Stupid Britney Spears guy.  Good.  If he ever does call it, tell him to go screw.  We don't want to talk to him anymore.  We don't?  Leave Chris alone.  I believe him alone.  Wait, hold on.  Can we hear that?  Hold on.  Leave Chris alone.  You hear that? 
[02:31:30]  Hold on, sir.  We have to hear...  Wait.  We'll stop talking.  It's an echo.  What is that?  It's an alarm.  It's probably somebody in that room screwing with us.  Shut their mic off.  Okay, now let's see if we hear it.  No, there it is.  It's coming over the system.  Yeah, what is it?  It's an alarm.  It sounds like one of those...  Is it the bad radio alert?  It's a klaxon. 
[02:32:00]  It's a klaxon.  It's a bad radio alert.  94 YSP beeps.  Yeah, what is that?  Can they stop that?  And the feedback's coming in.  And you guys bragged that WISP is great.  Well...  It is great.  What?  It's going to be great again.  They got to just figure out some things.  What the hell's the problem?  They got to get people to work a little longer.  That would help.  Yeah.  Everyone abandoned ship today.  Who's here? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, I know who's here.  Who?  I have no idea.  We are?  Our crew?  They hired security guys and everyone else left.  The sound guy.  The sound guy.  No, he's gone.  Kenny, will you do a one-man parade if we get the...  All right, we got the phone.  Lunch put her in charge.  Let's say hi to Danny on the streets of Philadelphia.  Danny.  Hello, fellas.  All right.  Oh.  All right, we got Danny.  I'm on the phone.  Actually, I just witnessed the sound guy running and almost dropping all of his equipment as 
[02:33:00]  he ran upstairs.  So I think he's going to try to set up something really good.  Ah, I like that.  Hey, Kenny, can you go downstairs and be the one-man parade for a little bit?  I do what I'm told.  All right, get downstairs.  The one-man parade.  Go ahead.  All right.  What is it?  What's he got to say?  And who?  Most radio shows develop this stuff off air.  We're just going to develop it on air.  Why not?  Kenny, go outside and be the one-man parade on a cell phone.  We need the one-man band outfit, though.  The cymbals between the legs and the drums. 
[02:33:30]  Dan, can you whip that up quickly?  Sure.  What's he going to do?  Are you going to march?  Yeah.  You got to march.  Like, kick your legs up.  Not goose-stepping, but kick your knees up high.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, tomorrow it's not going to be organized like it was today.  Oh, really?  Tomorrow you can show up at the TLA on South Street for a live Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We're hoping to get a couple hundred people there.  It's going to be tough because it's early in the morning, but we got lots to give away. 
[02:34:00]  We got what?  Monday Night Football tickets to give away for the Eagles?  Eagles tickets, Phillies tickets, cash, virus tickets.  Virus meet and greet, all that stuff.  I think we got $1,000 cash we're going to give away.  Yeah, there's cash.  Yeah, so it's going to be a lot of fun.  What's the strangest thing you would do for Eagles tickets?  We're doing that tomorrow live at the TLA.  Call today and let us know what you would do or just stop by the TLA tomorrow morning.  We'll have you come up on...  Who cares about this?  All right, whatever.  But the important thing is the doors open at 5 tomorrow at the TLA and we're broadcasting live 
[02:34:30]  and we're going to be celebrating the big announcement here at YSP.  What announcement open?  Oh, well, you're going to have to wait until 5.  But I want to know what announcement.  Kid Chris, 5, and you'll find out.  It's going to be classical music.  Is that what we're with?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bach is back.  Bach?  Bach is back.  Bach's back!  The Bach station.  Yeah, the Bach station.  They just misspelt it. 
[02:35:00]  All right, Danny.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, you're still out there.  All right.  Yeah, it's pretty exciting.  People going to work and smoking cigarettes.  It's so exciting.  I really peddle them.  Hey, Kenny, why don't you get on the cell phone out there?  All right.  Yeah, Kenny's going down.  He's going to start the parade of one.  The parade of one, and then if we get the engineer to set up the stuff, then we'll go  down, then the listeners will go down, and then we'll try to get some excitement here  in Philly.  All right? 
[02:35:30]  Sorry.  I was looking at that guy.  I thought he was fiddling with himself.  Sir, will you please stop your incessant fiddling?  All right.  All right.  Good.  I'm tired of your little hands moving.  He's still doing it.  Yeah.  Sir, for the love of God.  Which guy?  The guy in the red.  His hands won't stop moving, and it's distracting.  Will you please stop your unending fiddling? 
[02:36:00]  All right, we're waiting for Kenny to get on the cell phone.  When do we have to break for Philly?  Kenny with the dry hair parade.  What time do we have to break here?  It's like a hayride.  Kenny has a haunted hayride.  I know.  He sneezes.  Just sit on his head.  He sneezes.  A pitchfork falls off his scalp.  There's a horse eating it.  Old Oats head. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  What's happening?  We're waiting for Kenny.  Seven minutes to what?  Break.  Oh, okay.  Seven minutes for what?  I thought seven minutes until something happens.  I thought seven minutes for the guy to set up?  No.  How long for the guy to set up?  45.  It's still 45.  But he's here.  Well, it was 45 minutes how many minutes ago?  But I thought 45 minutes was because he had to turn around.  We should make him set it all up and then not use it.  Minus 10, so now it's 35 minutes.  Dude, we should set it up and then not use it.  That's right.  Have him set it up. 
[02:37:00]  It can't take 35 minutes to set up.  That's like a five-minute job.  I don't know.  I've never set up one of those remote things before.  You have a couple times.  You've got to align the thing with the whoosie winky.  I don't know what you've got to do.  Kenny?  No Kenny yet.  I'm not out there yet.  This is a long way down.  Big dummy.  Is the lummox taking the elevator?  He's probably taking the stairs for some weird ex-cop reason.  Here he comes.  I don't take the elevator. 
[02:37:30]  It's dangerous.  That's where perps are.  I'm going to put Kenny on the phone.  All right.  Hang on.  All right.  Here's Kenny.  Hello?  Hi, Kenny.  Hi.  How are you doing?  All right.  Are you ready to start the one-man parade?  I'm down on this street here.  It's pretty desolate.  I was looking for somebody to annoy right off the bat.  Do you have a bullhorn?  No.  No.  I just, you know, I'm just a public nuisance.  It's just me.  Yeah.  They're all going to the window to see you.  Oh, is that what they're doing? 
[02:38:00]  I thought they were all just leaving.  I'm looking at the crowd.  All right, Kenny.  Why don't you start the one-man parade?  Yeah.  All right.  But there's nobody even on this block to see it.  There's no one on the whole block.  No.  All right.  Here's another lady in the bus stop.  Let me...  Miss?  Madam?  Toots?  Toots?  Hey, lady.  Miss?  Miss?  What?  Did you know that WISP, the radio station, broadcasts in this building? 
[02:38:30]  No, I didn't know that.  Yeah, it's a radio show.  Yes.  Do you know there's a big announcement today at 5 o'clock?  No, I didn't know that.  Do you know what the announcement is?  No, I have no idea.  Well, you'll have to listen 94.1 at 5 o'clock, all right?  Yes.  Would you parade around with me to try to draw some attention?  No, because I'm required to be up here at 10 o'clock.  Why?  To be there.  What do you got to do at 10 o'clock? 
[02:39:00]  I guide people around the Quaker meeting house.  What is that?  A Quaker meeting house?  It's a kind of a church for Quakers.  Open to tourists.  I thought it was like cereal, Quaker oats.  No, it's not.  Quaker oats has nothing to do with Quakers.  It's just a very good food.  All right.  Are you single?  No.  No?  49 years married.  Oh, God bless.  Ask her if she speaks Greek.  Come on.  Wait, my friend wants to know, do you speak Greek? 
[02:39:30]  No, I don't.  No?  Personally, I speak the international language of love.  Oh, well.  That's interesting to hear.  All right.  Let me know you're going to say it.  Madam?  Madam?  Do you know?  She said she's not interested.  Not me, but I just...  Did you know WISP broadcast out of this building here, the radio station?  No, I didn't. 
[02:40:00]  But I'm...  I don't...  I don't...  Oh, boy.  She wants nothing to...  You're busy.  Going to work?  Going to work?  Yeah.  All right, but there's a big announcement today.  Ma'am, you should get...  You should get up on current events.  All right.  Hey, sister?  Yes?  Did you know there's a big announcement today with WISP?  Yeah, why?  They're broadcasting.  Look, you see?  That's their truck.  It's...  Right now, it says 94 WISP talks, but after 5 o'clock today, that's not going to be true. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  I'm talking on the radio now.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, yeah.  And so, why is that?  Why?  There's a big announcement.  5 o'clock.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, you want to parade around with me and let everybody know?  Oh, baby.  I'm trying to have another appointment right now.  What?  What's more important than me?  My job interview. 
[02:41:00]  What kind of job are you trying to get?  Oh, it's a hospital with the environmental.  Really?  Yeah.  That sounds important.  All right.  All right.  Have a nice day, anyway.  All right.  All right.  Can I get a burger with that shake?  Oh, he is a nudge.  All right.  All right.  Here comes another guy. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Hey, brother.  What's up?  Oh, man.  Hey.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good with that.  What's going on?  Oh, yeah.  Bye.  Did you know 94 WISP at radio station?  Yes.  You know there's a big announcement?  Yes.  What's the announcement?  All right.  No.  Huh?  No comprende.  Ricky Martin.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come on.  What's up?  Don't walk out into traffic.  You're going to get hit by a car.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  That's all I could get out of that guy.  No comprende.  There's not too many people on this block.  And no one wants to walk in the parade with you.  No.  No.  Everybody's got, like, an excuse.  Like, they got something better to do.  Let me see if I can find anybody.  Oh, here comes a hot number.  Hey, miss?  Could you cross the street so I can talk to you?  No. 
[02:42:30]  Please?  Come on.  Do you know, do you listen to WISP, the radio station?  Yeah, I got satellite.  You got satellite?  Yeah.  What, XM?  What am I listening?  What are you doing?  Is this the weenie in the butt?  No, no, no.  What's your name?  Megan.  Megan?  You're very cute.  So, listen, there's a big announcement today at 5 o'clock, WISP.  Do you know what the announcement is?  No, I just said I listen to satellite. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, well.  They won't like me.  I listen to Howard.  All right, go.  Woo!  She was ugly anyway.  Ugly.  All right, let me find somebody else.  All right.  She was ugly.  It's all winded.  Ladies? 
[02:43:30]  How you doing?  I thought he just got pepper sprayed.  Nah.  Miss, did you have a nice taxi ride?  Great.  Yeah.  Did you know WISP, the radio station, is making a big announcement today?  Yes.  You did?  I did not know.  5 o'clock, there's a big announcement.  What is the announcement?  Do you know what it is?  No.  Would you like to walk around and we'll spread the word about the big announcement?  What is the announcement? 
[02:44:00]  We'll do like a parade.  What do you got a little dressed up sex like?  It's a very important Jewish holiday this morning, Rosh Hashanah, beginning of the Jewish  New Year.  And this is what starts it and ends next week with your quarter.  Hey!  Hey!  So many boys should be...  All right.  God bless.  Happy New Year.  The Jewish New Year.  That's right.  Rosh Hashanah.  Maybe that's why no one's here today.  Yeah.  Ah. 
[02:44:30]  Did you know WISP, the radio station, is making a big announcement today?  About what?  I don't know.  Did you hear about it?  No.  Yeah.  5 o'clock.  Big announcement.  Okay.  I'll look for it.  No.  Would you like to walk around now and spread the word with me?  No.  Why?  Where are you going?  I have to go to work.  What do you do for a living?  I'm an event planner.  Well, let's plan this event.  5 o'clock.  Big news.  All right?  All right.  You're very good looking.  Please spread the word with me.  Yes?  Plan this event. 
[02:45:00]  What a douche.  Um.  I don't know.  There's nobody else around.  No.  It's, uh, the, the, the town's pretty dead today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There'll be more action tomorrow on South Street.  Yeah.  South Street's kind of crazy.  What's going on on South Street tomorrow?  Uh, TLA.  Uh, Opie and Anthony will be brought.  Hey, brother.  What's up?  Do you know?  I'm talking on the radio now.  W-Y-S-P.  This is a street cleaning guy.  This is a hardworking blue collar gentleman. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You know there's a big announcement today on the radio?  About what?  W-Y-S-P.  5 o'clock.  There's a big announcement on the radio.  No, I didn't know.  No?  Uh-uh.  You want to walk around and spread the word and tell people?  W-Y-S-P.  Yeah, the radio station.  I, I'm working now.  What do you do for a living?  Explain to everybody.  I work for SEPTA.  I'm a janitor.  Yeah, but I see you.  You got the little sweeping thing and the other thing.  So explain what you do exactly.  I clean the SEPTA station. 
[02:46:00]  Like 5th Street, 2nd and Market.  Where the passengers get off and on the train.  No, I know that.  You sweep up, what do you do?  I sweep up, I clean the bathroom, I clean the cashier booths and all that stuff.  And make sure all the graffiti and all that stuff is off the platform.  You don't mind cleaning the bathrooms?  No.  That's my job.  All right.  You probably need a lot of interesting people in the bathroom.  No.  Why not?  I would.  Well, I close the door when I'm doing it.  All right.  I don't have anybody walking in on me.  All right, Dads, quit slacking off and get back to work. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  Slacking off.  How about you, hot stuff?  Did you know WYSP is making a big announcement today?  Come on, my moving sister.  You knew that.  Come on.  We're on the radio now.  I'm trying to spread the word about the big announcement.  Come on.  Where are you going to work?  All right.  She, she, she don't talk.  Yeah, she don't want to talk to you. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, I got a magnetic personality.  I'm very charming.  He does get more out of people than he should.  Do you know that the radio station is making a big announcement today?  Why are you laughing at me?  I know I'm funny looking.  Another one speechless by me.  He's laughing at you, Kenny.  It was like an old lady.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  I don't think Kenny's parade is panning out so well.  No.  No.  We might have to bring these guys down there, too.  No.  To help Kenny out.  Kenny.  The room?  Yeah, because they're falling asleep.  We've got to wake them back up.  Dozing.  All right, Kenny, we've got to take a break here on WYSP.  Okay.  And we'll figure out what we're going to do with your fine parade after the break, all right?  I hear you.  I hear you, too.  Good job.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Philly. 
[02:48:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show live from WYSP studios in Philadelphia.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Philly.  That's YSP.  WYSP.  94 YSP.  Morse codes.  Pachoo.  Pachoo.  Bet you there's a lot of lasers.  When they put the new station on the air. 
[02:48:30]  What are you talking about?  Pachoo.  Pachoo.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Pachoo.  Pachoo.  Pachoo.  All right.  And we're also here, of course, because we've got the big comedy show Saturday.  Oh, that's right.  God, I didn't even remember that.  At the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  Tickets still available.  The last show of the tour.  That's it.  I think we're going to a Phillies game tonight.  Last big blast of the season.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  It's finally coming to an end.  It's been a long summer.  It's been a great summer.  Yeah.  There's been a lot of fans all over the country.  And Saturday's the last one for a while.  Yep.  I hope a lot of people make it out there.  Ticket sales are very, very good.  Eight or nine comedians you know and love for the show.  They own a village.  What else you got going on?  Us.  Us, of course.  Us.  Us.  Hey, the O&A Cafe is leaving.  Look at this.  All right.  Those guys are leaving. 
[02:49:30]  They're going downstairs.  I think we're ready to broadcast our parade.  No way that happened that fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a go-getter.  Kind of just screwing off today because, well, YSP has nothing else to put on the air today.  Yeah.  Until Kid Chris this afternoon.  And, of course, by this point, we would have been doing breaks on horrific things.  Yeah, well.  Well, yeah.  And we figured this was better than, you know, the construction sound effects. 
[02:50:00]  We're building a new radio station.  Clank, clank, clank.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned for the big announcement.  Ew, they do that.  Stations do that.  Yeah.  They make a loop of construction sound effects and a big voice guy comes in.  At 5 o'clock today, YSP will never be the same.  We're building a new station. 
[02:50:30]  Make sure you're listening at 5 o'clock to Kid Chris for the big announcement.  We're building.  Yeah, we get it.  See, it was that or this crap.  All right.  Is the mic on downstairs?  We'll turn it on.  Let me hear something.  Oh, well.  Let's hear what we...  Well, the two guys I'd want are up here, so.  Oh.  Yeah, Kenny, get down there.  Kenny starts and then...  Oh.  When we leave the studio, we join the parade. 
[02:51:00]  Let's do it.  Oh.  I didn't know.  And all the people are down there, too, now, so...  Yeah, so this will be a little better than the Club Soda Kenny on a cell phone.  Yeah, other people that pass by will see it and go, oh, what is this event?  By the way, a lot of questions about the big broadcast tomorrow.  Tomorrow's going to be a great broadcast live from the TLA.  We got so much we have to give away and do on that show.  We got to find a comedian to open up the virus show on Saturday. 
[02:51:30]  Yep.  So we're doing Car Crash Comedy live in front of hopefully a couple hundred people.  Doors open at five, and they'll remain open because Tom and Philly's like, is there a  time limit?  No.  It is first come, first serve.  If we fill the joint, which I don't think we will at five in the morning...  That's pretty early.  That's like five, six hundred people we need.  But if we do, there would be a line, but I think you would move through the line fast.  Hey, Kenny.  One, two, one, two, three.  What was that?  We're building anew.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Wait, Eric, do the test again.  I don't like the mic.  Check, one, two.  Who's checking the mic?  Oh, it's a missing I-want-to-go-home remote guy.  Yeah, I want to go home.  How pissed is he that he had to come back?  Live it.  For us.  For this.  He wants to just play the tape of the construction.  Check, one, two.  All right, they're still checking the mic.  We hear it.  Yeah, we hear it.  Let the...  It's an engineer, though.  It's got to be perfect.  Oh, no, it doesn't.  They've got to look at the DBs and make sure it matches up. 
[02:52:30]  Let's just put the...  With the Zephyr and make sure the...  Zephyr?  What planet are we on?  That one's got to go down.  Huh?  Jimmy, go down.  All right, yeah, you go down, Jimmy.  Kenny.  Cut it out, Ant.  Not that kind.  Kenny.  Hello, this is Club Soda Kenny from the street.  Yeah.  Actually, the mic does suck.  Kenny.  Yeah, Club Soda Kenny.  I took it down the street level.  All right.  Well, your volume's a little overbearing.  That's my personality. 
[02:53:00]  Actually, it's not too bad.  Yeah, they're fixing it as they go along.  All right, keep talking, Kenny.  What's the scene down on the street?  It's pandemonium down here.  You're not going to believe it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, obviously, the announcement is spreading.  Yes.  Everybody, the ugliest guy I just saw, just walked right in front of me.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I just came down to warn you guys, too, about the training vampire on the loose, too.  Good, thanks. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, someone's saying this is worse than Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football.  Come on.  Really?  Wow.  No, no, all the fans are coming down here.  Yeah.  We're going to assemble, and we're going to parade, and we're going to spread the word.  Miss, you look very interested about what's going on.  I work here.  I work here.  Yeah?  Guys, I'm going to hold down the phone.  What do you do?  Okay.  All right.  Keeping it clean out here for O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's a nice woman.  Yeah, I like to keep it clean for O.P. and Anthony, too.  What about you, hot broads?  What's your story?  I have nothing to care.  We work here.  Yeah?  Where do you work exactly?  HRSI.  Really?  Did you know there's a big announcement today with YSP?  No, what's the announcement?  You got to listen.  Five o'clock, Kid Chris.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  Tell them to stick around if they want to see big stars.  Yeah, hey, listen, you hot broads. 
[02:54:30]  Big stars are coming down.  You want to meet them?  Not really.  Why not?  Are you spoken for?  No, I got to go back to her.  Yeah, but you got like two minutes just to meet like celebrities.  Who's the celebrity?  Say it, Kenny.  You got Opie.  Here's the reaction.  You got Anthony.  And then you got best-selling author, comedian, actor, and radio personality, Jim Norton.  Here he is making his grand entrance. 
[02:55:00]  Look at that.  Isn't he adorable?  Is this working?  Yeah, it's working.  Hold on.  Yeah.  I hear it, but where's Opie's at?  No, they're coming down now.  Hi.  Hi, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Thanks.  This sounds scratchy.  Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, it sounds terrible.  He probably doesn't have headphones.  Jimmy.  Thanks.  Jimmy.  Opie's calling you.  Jimmy.  Construction noise.  Yeah, they just started construction next door.  See, we're building a new radio station. 
[02:55:30]  I told you.  Tune in at five.  Five o'clock will be done.  Five.  That's a reconstruction.  That's a sexual operation.  They're trying to get the rest of us.  Jimmy.  All right, what are we doing?  I don't know.  This girl, she was telling me to stop staring at her.  Why?  I don't know.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  Jimmy can't hear us?  Jimmy, you can't hear O&A?  No.  No, Jimmy can't hear you.  Yeah, we might need headphones down there, too, so we can hear each other. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, no, we got headphones, but maybe they're not working properly.  For a second, I actually thought somebody was putting some sound effects up.  Huh?  For a second, I actually thought someone put up some sound effects.  There is actually this maddening construction going on.  It's perfect, though, because we're building a new station for Philly.  Tune in at five.  Five o'clock.  Five o'clock.  I'll find out what this becomes.  I'll call you boys later.  Wait.  All right.  Jimmy.  Wait, he's got technical difficulties. 
[02:56:30]  They're like doing his headphones.  I hear it in one side only.  Yeah, he only hears it in one side.  Yeah, because maybe there's a pounding in the other side.  Oh, Anthony, I can hear you now.  What the hell are they doing next door, knocking a building down?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you, Jimmy.  What's going on out there?  Oh, we're just standing here.  I can only hear through half my headphones.  Yeah.  And really not a lot.  We'd be lovely if you guys came down.  There's somebody here pushing a baby carriage.  All right.  Hey.  Where's our locations for the other people just driving around that want to join the parade? 
[02:57:00]  We're 400 Market Street.  400 Market Street.  Okay.  I will call you.  We're over here now at the Continental Building.  All right.  Should we join the parade there, Kenny?  Yeah, come on down.  All right.  Hey, are you ladies wondering what's going on?  Yeah.  Are you ladies wondering what's going on?  What do you think's going on here?  No, I listen.  I was listening to Quest Street. 
[02:57:30]  I listen to this all the time.  Oh.  Yeah.  And what do you like about listening?  I like to talk.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, who do you like to talk to?  Kid Chris.  Why is this not working?  And Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Well, Opie and Anthony are coming down now.  And Kid Chris is going to have a big announcement at 5 o'clock.  Okay.  I'll be listening.  All right.  There we go.  There's somebody.  Are you a mother-daughter team? 
[02:58:00]  Really?  All right.  This is terrible.  Any more new people showing up because of the bigger crowd down there, Kenny?  No, there's a guy.  Let me see.  Here.  Shit.  This lady, you just came down here to smoke a nice cigarette and be peaceful.  And now you're being annoyed by me, right?  No, you're not annoying me.  Really?  Not yet.  Just give it a few seconds.  Okay.  A few seconds.  All right.  Do you know superstar Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Ray girl program? 
[02:58:30]  No.  Isn't he handsome?  Somewhat.  Thank you, miss.  You're welcome.  That was very polite of you.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  No.  Wow.  We got a parade down here.  What?  Oh, there's Opie.  Does it sound this bad on the radio?  Oh, there's Opie.  Give it up for Cleveland.  Wow.  Look at all the people here.  Ooh.  Ed.  Yeah.  Did Anthony leave the studio too?  No, I'm still up here.  Come on down, you queer.  Oh, okay. 
[02:59:00]  I was waiting for Opie to get down there.  How far can we go with this?  All right.  I'm coming down.  You.  How far can we go with this?  Across the street to the bank and back.  It's all dependent.  Just go.  Go this way.  All right.  Just go.  All right.  We're going to wait for Anthony, so.  All right.  That's on the wrong frequency.  It's on the wrong frequency.  Okay.  He'll figure that out.  Kenny, how's the parade going so far?  Listen, when we parade, I want you to line up in size order.  So let's do this in an orderly fashion, size order. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, we want to do a single file parade, that's for sure.  So line up behind Patrick there.  Like a conga line.  Come on.  Yeah, let's go.  Line up behind Patrick.  This is it.  Come on, Phillies, man.  Get in there.  Go ahead.  Behind Patrick.  Yeah, the chick can get in front.  Yeah, we got to have girls up front.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hot chicks in front.  Hot chicks in front.  Yeah.  Ma'am, you're not hot.  You stay in the back of the line.  Come on.  Make room.  Make room.  Single file.  Move up a little bit.  We have to have girls up front so we don't look like a whole parade of moes. 
[03:00:00]  Only the hot chicks.  Move up a little bit.  All right.  Single file parade.  We're getting the single file parade together.  Get in the front.  Come on.  Get.  Yeah.  You stay to the back.  No, she should be up front.  She should be leading the parade.  You think so?  Well, of course.  All right.  Jimmy wants you to lead the parade.  You should be the parade marshal.  Oh, my God.  I got a headache.  That pounding of the construction going on.  That's the new station being built.  Hey, there you go.  See, YSP.  Yeah.  Big announcement.  Five o'clock.  Yeah, YSP talks. 
[03:00:30]  YSP talks.  So we got the single file.  Yeah.  Should we wait for Ann or should we just take off?  He's coming right now.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Anthony Cumia.  Let's go.  Wow, you can feel the excitement in Philly, Kenny, huh?  Let's hear it for Anthony Blackjack Cumia.  Let's hear it for Kenny's shorts. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Let's hear it for Kenny.  Boo.  All right.  Do we have signs?  Do we have...  We need instruments.  Yeah, no, we're going to make a lot of noise.  We need kazoos or something.  We got a harmonica.  Come here.  This is the ugly guy.  Have a place harmonica to start off the parade.  Yeah, we're going to be no touch.  Just play harmonica.  Okay.  I can do a rock scream if you want.  Yeah, rock scream.  Go ahead.  It's going to be rock now anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Or something like that, yeah.  Kenny.  Could you do that in the middle of the street?  Hold on.  Kick him out of the parade.  Yeah, I don't like him either.  Yeah, because he gave away the big announcement.  Kid Chris was supposed to announce that.  Yeah, take a look.  The great Kid Chris.  Yeah, go back to Kid Chris's show.  All right.  All right.  Put him in the back of the line.  He can join us.  All right.  All right.  I don't have a mic.  Oh, now I got a mic. 
[03:02:00]  Give me Kenny's.  Hi.  Thank you.  Sorry, Kenny.  All right.  All right.  Oh, you tried to take Kenny's.  I don't want to take Kenny's.  I'll share with Kenny, but as we're standing here, I'm talking, and he goes, I need your  mic.  And he just takes it.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we start the parade?  Oh, yeah.  Kenny, lead the parade.  We're just going to be like the commentators, okay?  All right.  If you're going to lead the parade, take the mic.  Listen, when we do this, we've got to do it properly, and we've got to represent.  All right?  So let's march correctly, and the cadence is O-N-A all the way. 
[03:02:30]  That's what I say.  All right.  Have a practice one.  All right.  Let's practice.  Ready?  One, two, three.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say. 
[03:03:00]  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  Is he marching?  Yeah.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  He's marching.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  Thank you.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  He is such an idiot.  O-N-A all the way.  That's what I say.  He has a gun.  Thank you, O&A, all the way.  That's what I say.  Thank you, O&A. 
[03:03:30]  All right, very good so far.  Very good so far.  Yeah, very good.  What can we add to the parade, Jimmy?  Anything?  Uh, no.  I kind of like it so far, though.  Yeah, it's really a...  I think we ought to say something about the announcement, maybe, at 5.  Okay.  Can we all talk us for faggots?  Yeah, talk us.  Well, O&A, O&A.  Yeah, beep your horn.  How about talk is for queers?  Talk is for queers. 
[03:04:00]  All right, let's practice.  Ready?  On three.  One, two, three.  Talk is for queers.  Talk is for queers.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  But wait.  Hold on, hold on.  But wait.  It doesn't have the same cadence as O&A all the way.  That's what I say.  But we, Opie, we talk.  We do a talk show.  Well, then doesn't it just make perfect sense?  What is on this mic?  I don't know.  It's like a bug.  All right. 
[03:04:30]  No, no.  There you go.  Oh, there we go.  Somebody's peeping.  Yeah, you better peep and drive away.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  O&A all the way.  How about that?  O&A all the way.  Oh.  O&A all the way.  They're not gay.  How about talk is for queers?  But that's anti-gay.  Well, how about talk is for queers unless you're listening to O&A?  Oh, how the hell are you going to do that?  All right.  I think we ought to go.  Let's cross the street.  Listen.  Let's cross the street.  Let's cross the street. 
[03:05:00]  Let's cross the street.  That's not a parade.  This is the dumbest parade I've ever been part of.  But they're loving it.  They're loving it.  Yeah.  Look at all the disruption.  All right.  Now we have crossed the street with our parade.  Now what?  Now we're on the sunny side of the street.  We got kids playing in the park over there.  We can mess with them for a little while. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, that'll be good.  You have to go to jail for that.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why half the crowd is going to cross the street.  That's right.  That's right.  Kid Chris will have the official announcement at 5 o'clock today.  I just like walking the block.  Just do a circle.  Yeah, nothing like just walking around the block with a radio show.  We really are just walking, doing nothing.  It's only good you showed it back up, sir.  Yeah, he's not happy with us. 
[03:06:00]  Is there like an adult bookstore around here or something?  Oh, that would be nice.  Oh, that would be nice.  30 of us just walking into one booth.  How about we take a...  Yeah, one quarter.  How about we go into the public restroom and I'll tap your foot?  How about we steal the city bus?  I don't think that's legal.  We're getting big trouble for that.  Let's go to the bank and do something.  Kenny, this lady wants to know what's going on.  Go interview her.  Fast.  Excuse me, ma'am.  Madam, you look interested and intrigued.  You're kidding. 
[03:06:30]  I didn't know who you were.  You don't know me?  No, but I didn't know.  Ma'am, that's Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, my name is Club Soda Kenny.  What's yours?  Excuse me.  Stop being rude.  How am I being rude?  I'm the politest and nicest guy you ever want to meet.  He's like stalking her.  All right, I don't like you either.  Oh, she didn't like her.  Talk to her, Kenny.  Eric, you can't touch people.  Keith, how you doing?  You live alone?  Can I call you? 
[03:07:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  Wow, Kenny was just trying to score.  Kenny was trying to make a date.  Yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to just be informing people about a big announcement.  I couldn't help myself.  Big announcement at 5.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Kenny, I think we need to do some kind of cheer again.  Yeah, we need something about, you know, at 5 o'clock.  Yeah! 
[03:07:30]  What do you say, Kenny?  We need another cadence thing.  You're good at that.  You're good at that.  All right.  Now this one, we're going to try it.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Ready?  On three.  One, two, three.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  All right.  We're going to do that while we march. 
[03:08:00]  This way.  Ready?  This way.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Us.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Us.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Why wouldn't you be up?  Mortified.  You just been pwned.  What does that mean?  Damn, you just been pwned.  Us.  Damn, you just been pwned.  There's a black guy on the phone.  Damn, you just been pwned.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Damn.  He has no idea.  Is this the most entertaining thing you've ever seen?  It's really good.  Yeah, it's the most entertaining thing ever.  Do you pay all these people?  No, these are big fans for the big announcement today at 5 o'clock.  Why do they win?  No, they don't win nothing.  They do.  They're big fans.  That's really strange.  Don't you listen to WISP?  No, I don't.  Well, you're not a rock and roll guy.  No.  We're bringing back The Rock to Philly. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, B.  What happened?  We're supposed to wait until 5 for the big announcement.  5 o'clock, the big announcement.  Okay.  Well, I'm happy for you.  Yeah?  If that's what you like, go for it.  What does that gentleman do for a living?  What do you do for a living?  What do you do, sir?  I'm retired.  Ah, congrats.  What do you used to do?  I'm a retired school teacher.  Really?  How old were the kids?  High school.  That's the best kind, right?  That's the only kind I could tolerate. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have kids of your own?  Yes, I do.  Are they successful?  Everybody's good?  Everybody's got a job and they're out of jail.  Nice.  God bless.  God bless.  God bless is right.  All right.  Let's move on with our parade.  All right.  This lady looks very annoyed.  No, wait.  That's the wife.  Wait.  That's the wife.  Oh, look at her running away.  She's running away, sir.  Why?  Your wife is shy.  She's very shy, yes.  Oh, she's running her the other way now.  We don't do this stuff. 
[03:10:00]  You still make a nice couple.  You from Philly?  No.  Opie.  Where are you visiting from?  Opie, you go one way.  I'll go the other.  Colorado?  We'll chase her.  They're from Colorado.  Excuse me, ma'am.  You know, the Philadelphia Phillies are playing the Colorado Rockies tonight.  They creamed them last night.  Waiting for a bus?  Yeah.  That was 10 to 0.  Just waiting for the bus, now?  Yeah.  30 to 0.  I hear you.  Come on.  It's all right.  Your wife is running away.  She's running away.  We got her to run away.  We cornered her like a rat. 
[03:10:30]  It's my birthday.  Good for you.  What's her name?  What's your name?  Lindsay Rakovich, and I have a second idea what the other announcement is.  What?  It's the premiere It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia today.  That's very true.  And I'm an extra on it, too.  But how old are you?  I'm turning 27.  All right.  Get up on here.  It's Jamie's birthday.  Get her up on here, Kenny.  Get her up.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's what?  What's your name?  Lindsay.  It's Lindsay Rakovich's birthday.  Okay.  It's Lindsay's birthday.  We're going to sing happy birthday to her. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, my God.  Yes.  All right, Kenny, you want to lead them in a happy birthday?  It's the best birthday ever.  All right.  Happy birthday to you, whore.  Happy birthday to you, whore.  Happy birthday to you, whore.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Go 94.1.  I don't have anything to shout out. 
[03:11:30]  Aren't you, aren't you, aren't you?  They're very small.  It's the core of you.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Isn't it a holiday?  It is my holiday.  Yeah, aren't you supposed to not be working or something?  What do you think I'm doing right now?  Well, you're not working?  No.  Oh, aren't you supposed to be home, like, doing something?  No, no.  How do you celebrate Rosh Hashanah?  I'm not Jewish, but everyone thinks so.  Hey, can we pinch your butt?  I'll probably use the name that I thought was a Jewish-sounding name.  Lindsay Rakovich.  I know.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Thank you.  I'm an undergraduate.  Oh, okay.  We want to bring back the pinching of the butt.  Oh, okay.  Well, here.  That's true.  Who wants to pinch your butt?  No, I know.  Like a businessman.  How about this thing?  Like a boss.  Can I pinch your butt?  Like a boss would have pinched a secretary's ass back in, like, 1960.  I like today, you know.  But we just want to pinch your butt.  What are you doing, Harry?  No.  And there's all these men here.  Well.  Here's another one.  There's one of a squirrels.  Yeah, that's another one.  How are you going to pinch them?  I mean, just outside the skirt, right?  No, we can pinch through the skirt. 
[03:12:30]  We don't need a skin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's outside.  Just like you're a secretary from 1970.  Yeah, you know how the secretary, the boss, used to go, hey, honey, and give her a little  pinch.  Yeah, I've been there tonight.  You know what I'm saying?  We call that the good old days.  All right, I'll see yours first.  All right, watch.  See?  Oh, my God.  I just saw a nipple.  Well.  Yeah.  And that used to be a guy.  That used to be a guy.  I can't.  I'm a lady.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm so boring.  All right, can we pinch your butt?  Here, I'll pinch there. 
[03:13:00]  There.  Yeah, don't fall.  All right, get lost.  I just pinched.  We're bored with you.  All right.  That's all right.  All right, let's go this way.  Oh, brother.  How's our parade going, Kenny?  Good.  Going strong.  This is the worst parade ever.  I love this parade.  Jimmy, I'd say this is a bonafide hit.  Hey, you guys want some parade music?  Oh, parade music?  Yeah, would you like some?  All right.  Maybe a little in the background.  Yeah, let's hear some parade music.  Hey, can we all get in your pickup?  Oh, that's good.  Now the back's on.  Oh, man. 
[03:13:30]  Look, we got parade music.  Now we're talking.  Yeah, now we're cooking with gas.  Now I feel like we're parading it.  How about we get in this guy's pickup?  But he's got a cover.  Oh, just jump in the front seat.  What?  Who?  Everybody?  Oh, sorry.  The guy wants to.  I'm in the middle of a broadcast.  What do you want to ask me, sir?  I just want to know if he had an iPhone.  I look like an iPhone.  Maybe I'm wrong.  That's Booger, Hector.  I know who it is, sir.  That's Booger.  So clever, Michaela.  What?  Do I have an iPhone?  Yes.  Oh, I know, I know.  But why in the middle of the broadcast?  Oh, no. 
[03:14:00]  I just saw you.  I'm a technology geek, so.  Ah.  That's the kind of...  You ever try one?  It doesn't work well with Booger smeared on your finger.  I actually don't blame them.  This doesn't sound like a broadcast.  Of course not.  They just come up and ask you questions.  All right.  Where are we going next, Kenny?  We got parade music, so this is going very well.  Um, let's see these two chicks over here.  This is not so much a parade.  Is it just an unruly mob?  Yeah, this is wilding.  Looking into start trouble.  Can we go in?  Oh, that's Fox television. 
[03:14:30]  Well, maybe we can tell them that there's a big announcement.  Hey, is there any live TV going on?  Does anyone know?  No.  It's 11 o'clock.  They have 11 o'clock news.  All right, 11 o'clock news.  We're breaking into Fox doing some live news.  Hey, ladies, how you doing?  Very good, thank you.  How are you doing?  All right, what are you doing out on the street at this hour?  We're actually meeting with the client.  Where, what is this for?  We got a big announcement today, WYSP Radio State.  I'm actually on the phone with a customer right now.  A customer? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  What are you trying to sell?  Um, full service, direct mail.  Really?  No, you look like you're very successful.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  Looks like you are, too.  Well, you're a poor judge of character.  What are, what is that, what is that?  Ask him if they want to smell my finger.  This is the big, big announcement today for WYSP.  You want to talk?  Sure, my brother's a big fan of you guys.  Oh, really?  Really?  Yep.  What does he tell you about us? 
[03:15:30]  Nothing good.  Oh.  Really?  Do you know if there's any live TV going on at Fox now?  Not that I know of, no.  11 o'clock news.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy, it's breaking up.  You want to try to sell me something?  No, I don't think you'd buy it.  What?  You're saying I look broke?  No, no, no.  You're far beyond it, that's why.  Oh, I got my mic back.  Full service direct mail.  What the hell is full service direct mail? 
[03:16:00]  How about full service something else?  What is full service direct mail?  What is that?  I just don't know what it is.  It's mail that you get in your post.  Junk mail.  There you go.  So, it's junk mail.  Oh, wait, you actually, you provide a service to companies that you'll deliver mass mailings.  That's exactly right.  Okay, but so what happens if people don't want the junk mail?  Well, then they throw it away.  So, you're a spammer.  You spam.  I don't think so. 
[03:16:30]  No spamming.  No?  Yeah, there you go.  That's it.  I'm awake.  Hello, hello?  Okay.  Do you feel that that's a little invasive, like kind of just spamming people's mailboxes?  I absolutely do.  Yeah.  Email boxes, that is.  Not mail.  Yeah, not mailboxes.  You do junk mail or email?  Perish the thought.  I think with junk mail, at least you have the option of going, you can throw it out.  And email, you need to do, you know.  Whatever makes you, whatever lets you sleep at night.  You don't do email?  I don't do email.  Boring!  Yeah, this is boring. 
[03:17:00]  We're interviewing people that do direct mail.  I know.  On the street.  That's fun, though.  You never meet them before.  Jesus H.  Michaela should ask her where she had her operation done.  Ah.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, I'm walking away from that.  Oh, my God.  Look, it's a pest control truck.  Hey, Kenny, why don't you talk to this fine gentleman?  Oh, this guy looks like a personality.  How are you, sir?  Hello. 
[03:17:30]  Hello.  Hello.  How are you doing?  All right.  What is this?  Uh, we're a church group.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love your bag.  Is that Gucci?  That's my purse.  What do you need to curse?  Oh, I live in California.  I go to all stuff out there.  That's my purse.  California?  What are you doing here?  Oh, just a minute.  I want to see the Ben Franklin court.  Yeah, his house is right across the street. 
[03:18:00]  That thing is right there.  He used to live over there.  That's what I come here for.  Sir, you have rather large glasses.  Why the large welding glasses?  Chinese Terminator.  No, no.  I live in California.  So everything is from California.  It's a sperm shield.  Oh, my.  Is that to keep the sun out of your eyes?  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Did you have surgery recently?  No, no.  I want to see this.  Have you ever enjoyed the pleasures of a younger gentleman?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yes, my wife. 
[03:18:30]  Do you prefer a smoother younger gentleman or one that has some type of hair?  Oh, I don't know.  All right.  Hair, right?  Hair?  Yeah.  Oh, I think I want to go there now.  Okay, you can go there.  Yeah.  No, have a good time for yourself.  He looks lost.  Should we take him to Ben Franklin's house?  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  All right, listen.  I want to knock on the TV station.  We got to go on live TV today.  That guy was a hoot.  Yeah.  I can't imagine that YSB has kept us on the air this long. 
[03:19:00]  I'm sure it's...  We're just doing this for our enjoyment at this point.  They got to just imagine this is some kind of stunting.  Yeah.  Like, instead of real radio, it's this crap.  At least we have music.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  We've got to break.  I hope this doesn't break.  Don't worry.  We won't harm your children.  That's not...  Yeah.  Oh, the kid's nervous.  Look at her running away.  She's running that way.  Can we get in? 
[03:19:30]  We've got an announcement to make, and we...  This is news.  This is big news.  Wait.  Big news.  Kenny.  Is it going to break up if we go inside, Mr. Engineer?  I don't know.  It's going to dump out.  All right.  I'll go in.  I'll be right out.  Go in.  Tell them this is big news.  Opie is going into the Fox News affiliate here.  He's talking to somebody at the door.  This is big news.  YSP, we've got a huge announcement to make at 5 o'clock. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Kid Chris.  We have big news, sir.  Big news.  Screw this Putin stuff.  I see they're announcing something about Putin.  Yeah.  Kicking out the government.  Yeah.  Who cares?  They're bombing.  You know, we might be bombing.  Call the tip line.  Tell them there's a big announcement.  Get the number.  What's the tip line?  Or I'm just going to ask to use the bathroom instruments. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, is that what you're going to do?  We have to call the tip line.  Tip line?  Yeah.  Why would we?  We're here to give them big news.  Yeah.  Do you think if, like, the president came up here, he'd have to call the tip line?  All right.  Who's going to go on live TV and take one for the team?  Michaela.  All right.  All right.  Go and say that you have to use the bathroom.  Come here.  Yes.  Tell them you have to use the bathroom.  And then you just wait in the stall.  And you've got to figure out where the studio is, though.  Is it right here?  Yeah, I think it is.  Like, around the street.  I think it's on the second floor or ground level. 
[03:21:00]  But I can find it real quick.  All right.  Cool.  Give me five minutes.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go.  All right.  She's going to use the bathroom.  Godspeed.  And she's going to try to get on live TV for a big announcement for live TV.  What happened?  What happened?  Someone said, good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  All right.  Call the tip line.  Well, the guy's just, you know.  Give you a tip.  He's an older gentleman.  He's just a doorman.  He doesn't know nothing.  Yeah.  He doesn't know hard-hitting news. 
[03:21:30]  Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This lady's confused over here.  Yeah.  Miss?  What, did you just come back from jogging?  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  You're in good shape.  I can tell.  Thanks.  How long did you run?  Four miles.  Yeah.  I got a car.  You got a car?  Yeah.  We're making a big announcement.  That's why this group is out here.  What are you announcing?  WYSP has a big announcement, 5 o'clock, on the Kid Chris show.  What's that going to be?  You got to listen, 5 o'clock, WYSP, 94.1.  We'll do. 
[03:22:00]  You will?  I will, yeah.  Well, you got nothing to do today?  Nothing to do.  Nothing at all.  Could you tell me?  Wow, that was a good one.  Oh, God has got a good horn, man.  Wow.  He just...  That van.  That was a guy in a van that just...  He just got poved.  We just got poved.  Oh, my God.  I got a headache now.  Thank God I have these headphones on.  Who were you just talking to on the cell phone? 
[03:22:30]  My friend.  A female or a male?  Male.  What were you talking about?  Well, I was just...  He didn't even get his...  He didn't even answer.  Was it a booty call?  No.  Why, too early?  Not at 10.30.  Really?  So, what are your plans for tonight?  I've got class in a little while.  Really?  I got no class.  No class?  Lucky you.  Get it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You got a joke to tell the crowd?  No.  Come on.  Justice.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  No sense of humor here. 
[03:23:00]  Did the he-she get thrown out?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, why are we...  Marshall, what is this?  It's just...  The Opie Anthony show.  Are we on the radio?  Hanging out together.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you're going to be famous now.  What's your name?  Claire.  Claire, you want to say a shout-out to anybody?  No.  I'm not shouting out to anyone.  You want to do some push-ups or something?  I heard that, Steve.  No?  Can you do the splits?  We have to break soon.  We're going to have to break soon.  No.  Can you do a handstand?  Can't do anything. 
[03:23:30]  Really?  Oh.  I'm in law school.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You're going to be an attorney?  Yep.  Bend over.  Let me cross-examine you.  All right.  Our parade continues.  I think YSB has to take a break, and then we'll continue the parade.  Live from the streets of Philly.  How's that?  Hey, we got a banner now.  We got, like, a flag thing.  Yeah, but that's...  Well...  And we got the harmonica.  We're good.  We're good.  We're going to continue the parade in a few minutes.  We've got to take a quick break for YSB. 
[03:24:00]  I hate the harmonica.  It's Opie and Anthony, live from Philly!  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony, live from WISB in Philly.  Oh, my...  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Holy jeez.  How long was that break?  Is it...  It's still going.  No way.  Are we on?  No.  Is it Monday?  Are we on yet?  Should be.  Is it Monday?  Wow, that... 
[03:24:30]  The virus tour was great.  We had a great time in Philly.  We're back in our New York studios  because three days had to have passed.  It has to be four or five days since we broke.  What the hell was that?  I don't hear any music.  Are we on?  I hear the music.  You really do?  So we're back on?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, we're back on the radio.  The parade continues in Philly.  Oh, you should have seen where we went  during that commercial break.  We marched to Washington. 
[03:25:00]  Wow, way to take the energy out of our parade.  Thanks, YSP.  Wow, let's go back to the studio and fall asleep.  The parade continues.  We got a tambourine now, and we got a harmonica, and...  Yes.  And...  Well, uh...  And does anyone have any coffee?  I'm falling asleep.  I'm tired.  We all stood on that street corner  for the entire length of the parade.  Ten straight minutes without moving.  We just stood there.  I have white nurse shoes on,  and we just stood there.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  All right, well...  A lot of fans came by, though,  beeping and yelling frunkus  and howling.  Out of the vehicles.  Oh, look at this.  That was nice.  Look at this little...  little...  little cult-legged whore.  Cult-legged...  Talk to Sherry O'Terry, please.  Oh, God.  Miss, can I talk to you a minute on the radio?  You certainly can.  Are you Opie or Anthony?  He's Opie.  That's Opie.  Yeah, I'm the good one.  Oh, yes, you are.  What's your name?  Ruth.  You're a big fan of the show?  I certainly am.  Yeah, what are you doing  walking down the street at this hour? 
[03:26:00]  I actually just had an interview  with KYW.  KY Jelly?  Yeah.  What do you want to do with that?  He just brought me down  to talk to you guys,  and you walked up to me.  Rob Poluski.  Hi.  God bless you.  I'm Anthony.  How are you?  Nice to meet you, Anthony.  Nice to meet you.  That's my partner.  We make a good team.  Yes, you do.  I listen to you guys all the time  when I'm in my car.  What's the favorite thing you heard?  Oh, God.  You guys just cracked me up, period.  Do you like the impressions I do  and stuff like that?  I love your impressions.  All right. 
[03:26:30]  Take your attention.  Oh, no, no.  You can't finish that one.  We're on the radio.  We're right here.  No, no.  Nobody does it like the dice man.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm the insulting one, right, ugly?  You're calling me ugly?  You're the ugly one.  Right?  Oh, B.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm just teasing.  You can't insult me.  I'm in sales.  You're hot stuff.  Thank you very much.  I know.  I know.  I know. 
[03:27:00]  I know.  Well, this was a nice vacation day.  I got an interview.  I get to talk to you guys.  Wait, wait.  Club Soda Kenny's interrupting me.  What is it, stupid?  Can we play Unzip the Zipper?  All right.  Listen.  Club Soda Kenny's a little perverted.  He wants to know if we can unzip the zipper a little.  No.  Just an inch, please.  Why?  What's going on?  Nice.  Nice.  You got to respect that.  You like that, Kenny?  I sure did, Opie.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi, Jimmy Norton. 
[03:27:30]  How you doing?  You got my book, Happy Endings?  Oh, boy.  You're a hot one.  Boy, I like to pull that zipper down.  You don't want to do that, honey.  I want to have your job.  What a fun job to have.  All right.  We heard it already.  All right.  Enough.  Enough is enough.  Wait, wait.  Kenny likes to get some attention.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  Just thought I'd do a little Van Halen for you.  Kenny, comment Kenny. 
[03:28:00]  No, G.H.  You're doing a fine job.  Well, thank you, stupid.  So what else you got to say?  It's a beautiful day in the city today, and it's wonderful to be here and to be talking  to you guys.  What exactly did you have an interview for?  For advertising sales.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  But who knows?  I might wind up working for WISP.  Do you know there's a big announcement today, 5 o'clock? 
[03:28:30]  No, I didn't.  Well, if you're trying to get a job, isn't that a smart thing you should know, maybe?  Well, now that you told me, I'll make sure that I listen.  There's something about the last letter in WISP that I really enjoy.  Give me those ribs, you.  Aren't these guys terrific?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we are.  Thank you, Kenny.  Now, go fetch me something. 
[03:29:00]  So how long have you lived in Philly?  I don't live in Philly.  Don't touch me.  Don't worry.  You know, we're doing a big show tomorrow south and forth at the TLA.  You want to come by?  We'll have a few cocktails.  I don't know.  Am I getting, like, tickets with special seats or anything?  I'll tell you what you'll get tickets for.  Club soda?  You know, G.H., it might rain at the show tomorrow. 
[03:29:30]  Thanks, bearer of bad news.  What a surprise.  He gave me some bad news.  Oh, I'm pouring my heart out to this broadhead.  You're interrupting me, Kenny, you dolt.  I'm sorry, G.H.  Here's your yogurt.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Now, go iron my shirt.  All right.  Where are my tickets?  Tomorrow morning, you come by the TLA, south and 4th Street. 
[03:30:00]  We have a few cocktails.  Then Saturday, we're doing a...  Yeah, you're an early riser.  I don't drink in the morning.  Well, you don't have to drink, but you should just go.  All right.  Looks like your parents did.  Yeah, their whole lives did.  Wait, Kenny just made a funny one, Jimmy.  What was that, Kenny?  It looks like seek drinks, G.H.  Yeah, good observations, stupid.  What else is working?  I don't want to work either.  What?  I don't want to work either.  Oh, hold on, hold on. 
[03:30:30]  We got to get this on tape.  Hold on.  Big laugh coming up.  Sir, we didn't hear you.  Since no one else is working, I don't want to work either.  I drive a cab.  I don't want to work.  I want to hang out with you guys and spread the news.  What do you mean?  Hold on.  All right.  Audio cut out.  One more time.  I want to spread the news.  I don't want to work.  We heard you, stupid.  Big laughs.  Listen, you come by our show tomorrow,  and then you come by the comedy show Saturday night at the Tweeter Center. 
[03:31:00]  I would love that.  Who's the comedy show going to be?  It's eight or nine comedians you know and love from this show.  All right.  Did I do that good, Anthony?  I...  Bucky!  All right.  Well, it's time to move on.  Yeah.  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!  I'm not boring.  No, no.  Club Soda, what now?  Wait, what's your name? 
[03:31:30]  Isn't he terrific?  Yes, they all know how terrific I am.  Are you married, Ruth?  No, I'm single, honey.  Don't get married!  Puff!  Those whores, they take half of everything.  You're right, you do.  That's why I never want to get married.  Yeah, yeah, just keep putting out.  Oh, hey, hey, be nice now.  I'm a lady.  I'd like to spend the entire evening with you.  Remind me of the time I was with a couple of trannies.  You know what I mean?  Big back on you.  Wow.  Norton's incorrigible. 
[03:32:00]  He certainly is.  Yeah.  He's lucky I'm dressed nice today.  Oh, what can I say?  Well, you got a nice lingerie under there, I bet.  Maybe.  Are those thigh-high stockings?  No, they're not.  Are those pantyhose?  Yes, they are.  Okay.  I save the thigh-highs for other occasions.  Have you taken off smooth?  Because I don't like anything.  I like girls to look like aliens.  I like a little bit of hair.  I like a girl to be totally naked. 
[03:32:30]  Hey.  Don't touch me!  There's nothing wrong with that, believe me.  All right, you got anything else interesting to say, or we got to move on?  Yeah, I got to move on myself.  But it was a pleasure, and it was wonderful to get to talk on my face.  I know it was your pleasure to meet Opie.  Now, take a walk.  Do you like the Opie Anthony?  Yeah, I really do.  Does he really listen to our show?  I have you programmed in my car.  All right, which one is what? 
[03:33:00]  See if you can remember.  Opie Anthony.  Oh, she got it right.  Yeah.  She knows.  Yeah, and don't forget little Jimmy Norton.  Of course, of course.  And the big stupid idiot, Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  He is laughable, isn't he?  Yeah, he is kind of laughable, actually.  If he had a thought in his head, it would be lonely.  The only thing next to it would be a McGuire Wookiee card.  What did you say? 
[03:33:30]  I said, now, where do I go?  Now, Opie, behave yourself.  I can't help myself.  I guess.  I tell you, you're hotter than JonBenet after the choking.  Oh, that was bad.  You know, dead kid joke.  That was bad.  That was very bad.  Of course it's bad.  I'm Jimmy Norton.  I'm incorrigible. 
[03:34:00]  And I say awful things.  He's a best-selling author.  Did you get his book, Happy Endings?  I'm terrible.  I don't think so.  What happy ending was that?  I'm awful.  Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  She's a nice woman.  Look at this.  Oh, God.  He's filling up.  Oh, let me go.  Oh, God.  I'm a mean, breasted, nothing.  Club Soda again.  What stall can I meet you in later? 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Club Soda.  All right.  Goodbye.  Okay, G.H.  Yeah, we'll get you tickets.  O and A all the way.  That's what I say.  Fetch me something.  I couldn't think of the voices.  I couldn't think of anything.  I've seen Jimmy 8,000 times.  I can't think of one thing.  I see you guys five hours.  Oh, look at this.  Look at this number.  Yuck.  Hi.  Hi.  Cloris Leachman.  Oh, that's exactly who she looks like.  Hey, Phyllis. 
[03:35:00]  All right.  I guess, what do we do now?  We go upstairs.  We can ask this lady why her hair looks like Hermes Villach's.  After the shot.  Nice.  All right.  Yeah, I guess we'll.  Well, what else do we do?  Well, we go upstairs because the batteries.  Your batteries, they're dying.  They're dying.  All right.  I guess that's what we do.  And, yeah. 
[03:35:30]  Hello, miss.  How are you?  Hi.  Here we go.  Hey, the big plug.  Will you say when Ben took the pins out of the men?  Big plug.  Big plug tomorrow.  We're going to do it.  We're going to do another live show from Philly tomorrow from the TLA on South Street.  Yes.  5 a.m.  The door's open.  We encourage everyone to show up.  You don't have to, like, go to the website or anything.  Just get your ass to the TLA tomorrow starting at 5 a.m.  We'll broadcast live.  We'll give away Eagles Monday night football tickets, Philly's tickets, $1,000 in cash.  And we're doing car crash comedy. 
[03:36:00]  So if you think you're funny enough to kick off the ONA Tribal and Virus Comedy Show on Saturday at the Tweeter Center,  come on down tomorrow and try out for that as well, okay?  Yes.  Right.  All right.  And don't forget, 5 o'clock, big announcement on the Kid Chris Show.  Oh.  What?  Yeah, a big announcement.  What the beauty is, we're going to announce that The Rock is back with Kid Chris at 5 today.  And we're going to talk about that for at least 40 minutes straight.  With music playing at the same time.  And that's going to confuse the fuck it. 
[03:36:30]  Oh.  You know, we almost made it.  Almost made it.  I certainly hope somebody's on the dumb button because you know why?  There isn't one.  Now, we're not going through home base.  Are we on the line?  You might have just ended our career.  All right.  Wow.  That fine's coming out of your bank account.  Yeah, you guys are on a delay.  Ah, good.  I hope someone knows how to use it.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:37:00]  We'll see everyone tomorrow live from Philly.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks, YSP.  Opie and Anthony, live from YSP, YSP in Philadelphia. </pre>
