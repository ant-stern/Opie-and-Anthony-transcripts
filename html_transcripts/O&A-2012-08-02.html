<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about headphones, specifically the "ENG" labeling on Jim Norton's pair, revealed to be from the show's engineering department by staffer Mars.  This segued into listener mail, detailing instances of listeners naming pets after the hosts.  The conversation then dramatically shifted to synchronized diving, which Anthony deemed a predominantly gay sport, fueled by observations of divers' mannerisms and physiques in a post-interview clip. This sparked a broader, sexually charged commentary on various Olympic sports – swimming, weightlifting, and beach volleyball – focusing on athletes' appearances and perceived sexual orientations. The hosts also criticized the perceived lack of diversity in Olympic event scheduling and NBC's control over information.  A picture of a female weightlifter with hairy armpits generated considerable laughter and crude jokes.  The discussion further encompassed Olympic drug testing, a water polo player's televised nip slip, and the high taxes levied on American Olympic medal winners. Jim Norton shared an uncomfortable anecdote about filming a homeless, footless man for a segment.  The Olympic discussion continued, interspersed with other random topics, concluding this segment.


The next segment opened with a discussion on high taxes on athletes, referencing Bruce Jenner's post-Olympic earnings. This transitioned to a caller recounting a frustrating United Airlines experience involving a cancelled flight, unreimbursed expenses due to a ticketing agent's error, and their successful use of Twitter to resolve the situation. The hosts discussed frustrations with large, uncaring organizations and their potential contribution to violence (while explicitly stating they didn't condone violence).  The conversation then moved to memories of Dave Chappelle, including a young Chappelle's appearance on David Letterman, and the late comedian Charlie Barnett, his career, and death from AIDS.  Tony Woods' comedic talent, despite his relative lack of fame, was praised. The hosts discussed a National Enquirer report about Macaulay Culkin's alleged heroin addiction and his representative's denial.  A horrific Brooklyn murder case and the parents' decision to accept a plea deal to avoid a long trial were discussed, followed by a comparison of public outrage over the killing of a Somali comedian who mocked Islam versus the reactions to jokes by other comedians. The perceived hypocrisy in selective outrage regarding free speech was analyzed, using examples like the Dane Cook and Daniel Tosh controversies.  The Chick-fil-A controversy and the debate surrounding the company’s stance on same-sex marriage were also discussed, along with whether businesses should face boycotts or closures for their owners' views, contrasted with politicians holding similar views.  The segment concluded with a preview of a Black Sabbath interview and other upcoming plans. Offensive language was frequently used throughout.


The following segment focused on a debate about the freshness of Krispy Kreme donuts and whether the "light" indicating fresh donuts was genuine.  The hosts shared their experiences, debating the ability to distinguish day-old from fresh donuts. A caller claimed the light signaled donuts made for fundraising, not in-store sales.  A bet involving TVs on the hosts' ability to differentiate fresh and day-old donuts was made. Several callers offered their opinions and experiences, including a former Krispy Kreme employee confirming the light often indicated the need to sell older stock.  The conversation then shifted to a caller's persistent "nickel song" earworm; a host's dislike of desserts; a caller's claim that microwaving donuts doesn't affect their taste; bizarre vending machine items (tuna salad, mashed potatoes and gravy, pizza); the song "Meet Me in St. Louis"; and a conflict between a host and intern Sal, regarding Sal's work ethic since being hired. The segment concluded with further donut bet discussion and the hosts' critique of donuts from a local bakery, along with a discussion of a guest's Louis Vuitton travel bag.


The final segment prominently featured a phone call with former SiriusXM employee Mark Zito.  The hosts initially didn't recognize Zito, leading to insults and jokes at his expense, centered around his perceived forgettability and his SiriusXM hat.  The conversation then turned to Sal's work ethic and personality, including jokes about his long bathroom breaks. Zito's physical ailments (a hurt ankle) were discussed, as he was calling from a doctor's office.  Numerous vulgar and offensive jokes targeting Zito, Sal, and their mothers, along with sexual innuendo, were prevalent. Zito shared a personal story about attending his crush's wedding to another man, prompting further jokes. He also discussed a past band, including international gigs, and a humiliating story involving "whiskey dick."  Music from Zito's band was briefly played and mocked. The segment concluded with continued banter about Sal, homemade versus store-bought baked goods, and the absence of a staff member, Gary, who had been on vacation for days unnoticed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, oh, hello.  New headphones. Wow.  All right. It's like Christmas morning in here, isn't it?  New headphones.  Well, I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old,  and I've never gotten used to brand new headphones.  Every pair of headphones sounds different. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know why that is.  Yeah.  Do you know why?  I think there's a...  It's like the fingerprint.  You're never going to get two put together exactly the same.  Right.  So it's going to be some little,  and depending on how sensitive the ears are,  it's going to sound a little different.  They all sound just slightly different,  even though they're the same brand.  We use Sony's.  You know what, though?  You leave them on for a few minutes,  and everything just gets back to normal.  Yeah, I'll deal with it, whatever.  These are all new?  No, mine...  Mine look new. 
[00:01:00]  I thought mine looked new.  Do yours look new, Jimmy?  No, they say Jim,  and then they say E-N-G under them.  What does that mean?  Engineering?  Right.  What?  The engineering.  Does that mean this was the engineer's headphones  and they gave them to me?  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  You want Mars in here?  I want to know what that means.  Let's solve the mystery of the E-N-G  on Jimmy's headphones.  Yeah, I want to know if that means  that they gave me the engineer's headphones.  Wait, these new headphones are allowing me  to get some of the bass out of my voice.  I feel more bassy. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Mars, what's going on with E-N-G  on Jim Norton's headphones?  Good morning, boys.  How you guys doing?  Hi, Mars.  We don't need all that shit.  What's the E-N-G?  The E-N-G is for engineering.  It just came from the engineering department.  It's brand new.  We thought we were going to keep them,  but you needed a pair.  Thank you.  And we already inscribed engineering on them.  Okay.  So we put your name on them.  Are mine new?  Yours are new.  They're about two months.  Headphones are new.  Yours is about two months old.  Where were they?  What do you mean, where were they?  Where were they?  In a box. 
[00:02:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  So why does Anthony get headphones  from a brand new box  and Jimmy has to get headphones  that have E-N-G?  They were brand new as well.  When we opened up the box,  we thought,  how about you get another brand new set?  Mars, I don't get something.  These are new today?  No, not today.  Two months ago.  Two months ago, they were new.  So two months ago, these were new,  but I've been using them for two months?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe they were two months  in engineering.  No, no, no.  Yours has been for a while.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Yeah.  But they were brand new.  I believe you.  You want a brand new pair 
[00:02:30]  out of the box without E-N-G on it?  I don't mind the E-N-G  as long as I know that it's...  He kind of minds.  He brought it up.  Well, I wanted to make sure  I wasn't using somebody else's  old greasy headphones,  but if that's why they did it,  I like gymming.  Yeah, gymming.  It sounds like what we're going to do.  We're going to go gymming today.  Who else uses these headphones?  Anybody?  No, not at all.  Nice.  I like it that way.  All three headphones.  I don't need fucking lice.  Yeah, no one else uses your headphones.  All right.  So you guys don't have to go  to different radio stations.  I go into other places,  and it's like you got to use  the old raggedy guest pair,  and it's like, you know, 
[00:03:00]  because of what we do,  I know what bums have used  this fucking...  Oh, God.  The pads are all ripped off.  Oh, dude, they're terrible.  Horrible.  Oh.  Terrible.  Anyway, um...  Got those Rathacon ear bugs.  Fucking checkups.  They put creatures in our bodies.  Hey, make sure you wish  Kevin Smith a very happy birthday today.  I just noticed...  Happy birthday.  What is it?  That Kevin Smith on Twitter?  Let's push a big birthday  tidal wave toward Kevin Smith today  from the Opie and Anthony family.  Family. 
[00:03:30]  It's weird how many people  have gotten married  because of this radio show.  Ew.  I meant to bring that up a while ago.  You see it, man.  People are like,  yeah, because of your show,  I married a fellow fan.  My marriage was destroyed  because of this show.  I'm sure a few have been destroyed  because of the show, too.  Because of your show,  my cats are named Opie and Anthony.  I got a turtle  and I named it Jim Norton  because of you guys.  A turtle named Jim Norton.  Oh, sorry, Jim. 
[00:04:00]  That's actually hilarious.  That's a very appropriate name  for a turtle.  That's pretty funny.  It's a turtle with erection difficulties  named Jim Norton.  I bought a baby elephant  and I named it E-Rocket.  Oh.  Radio show.  Thing.  Well, I think synchronized diving  is a gay sport.  I just have to say it.  A gay sport.  And I apologize to the gays.  I don't mean anything by it.  I'm not closed-minded.  But it has to be said.  There are certain things  It has to be said. 
[00:04:30]  In this world  that are predominantly gay.  Right.  Like, gay people  do it predominantly.  Not all.  There's exceptions.  But if you look at things like  We're talking about like  people in the decorative field.  Right.  You're going to get  gay fashion.  Chances are you're going to  run across a gay  before a straight.  In the fashion industry  men in fashion  Right.  Predominantly gay men  Right.  go into fashion.  And now you're saying  that perhaps  I think 
[00:05:00]  synchronized diving  we don't know it yet  but is this type  same type of gay atmosphere.  I  I  we're living in a  I should say a more  because we'll get to  the Chick-fil-A shit  A more  later.  A more open  world.  Yeah.  But I think this  synchronized diving  was a secret  for a long fucking time  where it's like  yeah this is a gay sport  but we can't tell the world  it's a gay sport  because then they're not  going to watch the Olympics.  Right.  Well they're tiny little guys.  Is this the interview?  Okay listen to this. 
[00:05:30]  It's an interview.  Huh?  Yeah go backwards.  It's an interview?  Are they Americans?  Yeah the Americans  It's them.  The Americans  pause that.  The Americans won  the bronze last night  in synchronized diving.  Okay.  And then they were  interviewed.  Okay.  And this might be  very stereotypical.  Right.  But I think a lot of people  will just understand out there.  Let's just keep an open mind  and listen to me.  Hit it.  Olympian  a male in your sport  by the name of  Greg Louganis  what does it mean to you  to be going back 
[00:06:00]  to the Olympics  for a fourth time?  Well it's an amazing feat  and it's a great feeling  but our job isn't done.  We set out for a goal  and this is just  one of the steps  that it's taken us  to get to  our goal.  So we have a lot  of training to do  and we have  London awaiting.  Christian for you  you're still very young  but you've spent  a lot of years  already working  towards this dream.  Take me inside  your heart right now  and describe to me  what this means to you.  Well my heart  is beating very fast. 
[00:06:30]  Before I felt  really calm  and collected  throughout this entire meet  but not today.  Today was tough.  It was like a struggle  for me to kind of  get my heart rate down  and try to stay calm  because I kept  thinking ahead  even when I was  doing my hurdle  on the last dive  I was like  I think this is  going to happen  I think this is  going to happen  and I had to keep  kind of bringing it  back into the plow.  And some of those nerves  kind of got ahead of me  he was gay by the way  he smiled.  Yeah they did.  Huh?  Like when he smiled  you just know  that he smiles gay.  But if you say that  people go  oh that's crazy  what do you mean  they smile gay?  He has the gay face. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  The guy was brilliant.  The guy was fucking brilliant.  He wound up being  right about everything.  Sometimes you can just  judge a book  by its cover  and it's okay.  There is a gay smile right?  Well you can sometimes  just tell.  I'm so bad.  But with people  you can just tell  not always  but more times than not  you judge the book  accurately  because we have intuition  and we have judgment skills.  Why is that bad to have?  As long as you don't  make a shitty  and you know what  they might not be.  And that has to be said too. 
[00:07:30]  And if they are  I don't give a fuck.  My point is  I think it's a gay sport.  I really do.  The second you just  start treating someone  poorly because of that  then there's a problem.  Right.  But you could point it out.  You could be like  wow there is  sort of a mannerism  or look or something  that says that  this person is this  or that or the other thing.  Yes.  And there's no exception  to him.  He's got the gay face.  Can you find that?  The gay face.  What?  You know  the gay face.  And that was  that was years ago 
[00:08:00]  when you just didn't  openly talk about  any gay issues.  But he came up  with the gay face.  The gay face.  That was a spaz  who  you should look up  some of his stuff  it's out there.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  But anyway.  Yeah it seems like  the sport  perhaps a lot of gay men  go into it.  They got tiny  regular gayness.  Well that's regular diving.  Yeah.  I'm not really sure  about regular diving.  Yeah.  But synchronized diving  I'm really suspicious  because like you brought up  yesterday  then they jump in  the little jacuzzi together 
[00:08:30]  pat each other's asses  they get real close  and whisper to each other  about you know  what they're doing  and it's just  and a man uses  a real towel  well a man could be  I'm sorry  but the tiny towels  the little tiny towel  I guess what I'm trying to say  it's all about  just showing off  which it seems like  you know  gay men might  what am I doing  there's nothing  gay men seem to show off  their bodies a little more  and you know  they're using  little washcloths  to be proud of  to dab off 
[00:09:00]  the water  oh boy  yeah swimmers build though  that's the thing  in the gay community  there's nothing  like that's the definition  of a perfect body  swimmers build  swimmers build  they call it that way  because these guys  are sure in shape  yes  and I'm starting to think  the swimming  is a deaf sport  because a lot of these  swimmers  they talk weird  after they're done  unless they have  a lot of water  in their ears  in their ears  in their ears  you gotta find 
[00:09:30]  when they won  the bronze medal  because they're  very excited  good luck finding  anything from NBC  yeah  boy they are  keeping that shit off  they're just idiots  are they keeping it  offline  yeah they're trying  we're fucking dummies  they're idiots  right  they're idiots  they're fighting it  to be territorial  they're fighting  trying to like  hold back the results  and all this stuff  because they want  yeah they want people  to watch their  rebroadcast of all this stuff  yeah I get it  so you gotta be  creative with that  because we live  in an age where  you can't hold back  information anymore 
[00:10:00]  information  maybe for the very  older demos I guess  yeah  but they're not  on the computer anyway  so who gives a fuck  still watching tube televisions  right they're  they're waiting  for the Olympic coverage  yeah  the Olympics are on  let's all gather around  and watch our program  it's supposed to be  a men's sport  but girls  just want to have fun  was playing in the  background  really  wait a minute  come on  if you can find that  Matt and Jersey  that's just  Matt  that's the one we just 
[00:10:30]  watched  oh oh I didn't  I wasn't listening to  the music in the background  okay Matt  I got  alright thank you  oh I didn't hear the  girls just want to have fun  yeah  I don't know  you're not hearing that  at football games  no probably not  yeah I didn't watch  much of the Olympics  yesterday  it's the same shit  I started getting like  yeah I was watching  going like  this is the same thing  I don't care  they're doing the  backstroke  I think if the  Olympic committee  is listening  and they certainly  aren't  no  they should like  they should move 
[00:11:00]  around the events  why shove  why shove  gymnastics and  synchronized diving  out of four nights  in a row  and then finally  get to some track  and field  how about some  variety  yeah  I think they  want to save  on money  because the  athletes  a lot of  these athletes  go home  when their  event is done  and then come  back because  they have another  week  Jesus  you know  for the  closing ceremonies  but how cool  would we have  every night  it's a completely  different sport  what have we seen  beach volleyball  synchronized diving  and swimming  events basically  swimming  and then the 
[00:11:30]  gymnastics  and gymnastics  and then all  that's going to  go away  I guess by  tomorrow  or Saturday  and then what  weightlifting  then we shove  into the whole  track and field  thing  yeah  and then that'll  get boring  because it'll  feel like the  same thing  night after  night  the javelin  when we see  the javelin  throw  oh Jesus  look at him  in their  little jacuzzi  with their  tiny tiny tiny  tiny tiny  bathing suits  they all  squatting  under one  they all have  their ass crack  showing after  their dives  pubes  whatever  it's all to  make them  more aerodynamic  right  who knows 
[00:12:00]  I don't know  why  and has anyone  figured out the  the shit that's  on their bodies  is that covering  up tattoos  oh that  those  like  some of them  are weird shaped  and they go  around like  their thigh  oh the weird  shaped ones  I guess that's  a new technology  for muscles  and stuff  yeah  where you put  the muscle  in a certain  position  what  oh yeah  man  I don't get  it  I mean  maybe someone  could call up  and explain  what do you  mean  where's the wire  when you see  that weird tape  that's in a  very strange 
[00:12:30]  design  like off their  shoulder  or something  supposedly that's  to kind of  put the muscle  in such a way  it's probably  like the  breathe right  strip  oh right  type of thing  where they're  trying to  keep the muscle  in a certain way  is it for an injury  or is it  I think so  you could use  that muscle  to the ultimate  wow  I don't know  who figured that  out  I don't know  right  I don't know  it's sports  medicine shit  I think  but I'm talking  about these  like flesh  almost fleshy  colored  almost like  a light  orangey  thing that you'll  see on the  divers bodies  I didn't notice 
[00:13:00]  they don't allow  tattoos maybe  in the Olympics  and they're covering  I've seen some  chicks with  some Olympic  tats  Olympic rings  so someone  explain that  because I  looked it up  online  they don't  explain it  muscle stability  what  muscle stability  is the black  tape-ish stuff  oh they're  frolicking  boy the way  they frolicking  and laughing  together  in their tiny  little undies  you think it's  possible that a  sport in the  Olympics more  gays would go 
[00:13:30]  toward that type  of sport  or is that  crazy to even  say  because I don't  know the  answer  well my  theory would  be these  synchronized  divers have  to spend a  fuckload of  time with each  other  they just have  to get this  all straight  and it's in an  atmosphere of  very scantily  cladness  in the water  you know  and perhaps  some people  would like to  do that more  than others 
[00:14:00]  well that was  a good one  right there  how do you  know  I don't know  because they  look exactly  like mirror  images of each  other going  I hear it's all  about the splash  though  it is all  about the splash  the splash has  to be good  right  yeah they could  be a little  off on the way  down they will  get a deduction  but it's that  splash that all  important splash  it's got to be at  the same time  same angle of  entry into the  water  and they don't  want a big  splash  Chinese kick  ass at that  sport  when the  diver just  goes like  into the  water like  that and  barely any 
[00:14:30]  splash  that's pretty  god damn  good  well I think  that's because  they have small  genitals  yeah it's not  that big cock  hanging out  smacking on the  water  if you have a  big bulge  it's going to  leave some  kind of splash  when you hit  the water  Chinese  they've been  known  some would  say  some would  say  some would  say  and I think  thus then  not the  stereotypical  big dick  people  right  thus then  there's less  of a splash  I'm thinking  because there's  less shit  that's got to  hit the water  hugs  half naked 
[00:15:00]  hugs  how much fun  is that if  you're gay  though just  to be wearing  those shorts  and hugging  another man  in those shorts  oh my god  right  I would demand  a big towel  I don't get  the tiny towels  they love the  tiny towel  I would demand  a cover up towel  smacking each other  on the butt  with it  you think they  like to just dry  and keep showing  as much area  as necessary  yes  that's what  I'm getting  at  and then they  have these  weird showers  where they  have to lean  all the way  back  you see that  move yet  you haven't 
[00:15:30]  seen that  there's a wall  of showers  I guess  right there  so they  shower  really  they're showering  what's that  move that the  swimmers do  when they get  on their knees  in front of  the pool  and just let  splash themselves  in the face  and all over  their body  they're just  like  I guess  they're trying  to get used  to the water  but that's  the worst  way to get  used  and it's  like a big  splashy thing  they do  I'm becoming  a fan  of just  jumping in  now  finally  just jump  in  instead of  the slowly  change  your body  temperature  crap  where the 
[00:16:00]  water goes  up close  to your  nipples  yeah  break surface  tension  going in  what  what's that  mean  what  I don't  know  Blimey's  telling me  this  break surface  tension  from splashing  water  break surface  tension  going in  what do you  mean  I don't know  what that  means  that seems  a little  if your  body's wet  and when  you hit  the water  it's better  yeah  I would  guess  it's a  sport  where  a hundredth  of a second  means a shitload  but why not  just get wet  shower first  I think some 
[00:16:30]  of the guys  just jump in  quick too  right  and then pop  back out  I think I've  seen that  do they  yeah  I think I've  seen that  huh  I mean  really  how much  can you get  off of that  maybe those  bubbles that  form on you  when you're  trying to go  in the pool  maybe that  cuts down  your speed  like a hundredth  of a second  could be  everything  so  what a weird  sport that  that matters  right  and then  fucking  what's her  name  Franklin  there  her dumb  little hat  came off  halfway through  and she still 
[00:17:00]  won the  goddamn  really  yeah  so it's like  why wear the  fucking dumb  little torpedo  hat  wouldn't you  just shave  your head  commit  to your sport  swimmers  and divers  and stuff  used to  shave  their head  but I  guess  they want  to look  good  they want  to look  good  for the  Wheaties  box  yeah  and they  figured  if you  just wear  those  dumb  little  fucking  use the  tape  so it  prevents  you  from  injury  again  yeah  but I  don't  get how  tape  on the  outside  of your  body  prevents  that  muscle  from  pulling  it's  like a  breathe  right  like it pulls  the muscle 
[00:17:30]  over to one  side  so it can't  really tear  on one side  and you pull  it  but it looks  like it's  on there  kind of  willy nilly  yeah  doesn't look  like it's  like batten  down to  anything  it's on in  the water  too  that's got  a fucking  hurt coming  off  oh I saw  the girls  weightlifting  holy fuck  now what  sport is  that  lesbian  I'm just  asking  could be  did you see  the hairy  armpit girl  ew  and everyone  was tweeting  Jimmy would  love her  can you find  that picture  hairy armpit  girl  yeah maybe 
[00:18:00]  it might take  a while for  me to find  it  she had  full  hairy  armpits  and she  had the  weight up  in the air  military  press it  looked like  or something  like that  wow  and she  was showing  her hairy  armpits  oh boy  if someone  has that  quickly  just tweet  it to me  op radio  please  and that  will not  be the  most disgusting  thing in the  olympics  what will be  the controversy  that nbc  aired a nip  slip  during the  fucking  water polo  water polo  and it was  that disastrous  fat  thing 
[00:18:30]  someone tweeted  me that  picture  too  oh my god  what a mess  she has a shirt  on there  oh my god  that's not a  woman  well that's why  I'm asking  who goes into  that sport  I think certain  people go into  these type  certain sports  is all I'm  saying  that's all  nothing wrong  with it  it's alright  not that there's  anything wrong  with it  let me say  hi to Eric  in Jersey  what's up  guys  that's so  funny  that you 
[00:19:00]  would start  talking about  the weight  list  because it's  so contrast  to the  guys  synchronized  swimming  those girls  are juiced  did you watch  that yesterday  well first  of all  first of all  it's not  so many pickles  in the air  what  sorry about  that  no  you go  no I said  they had so  many pickles  on their face  and hair  you know  they're juicing  yeah  but I guess  they check  for all that  shit  no  maybe some  sports  they don't  check as  much  no they  check  they have  to  my question  is do they  check all  year long 
[00:19:30]  or do they  just start  checking like  a month  before the  games start  here's what  I've heard  oh wow  the Olympic tax  thing  can you find  that too  yeah  that's a good  one  you heard  about that  I heard  if you win  a medal  they check  you almost  immediately  to see what's  in your  system  right  but before  the games  start  let's say  a month  before  are they  checking all  year long  or do they  stop like  a month  before the  Olympic start  can maybe  clean out  your system  a little  bit  I bet  they check  you  I would  assume  they're  checking  here and  there  especially 
[00:20:00]  leading up  to the  Olympics  they kind  of know  who's got  a chance  to make  the Olympic  team  so maybe  they don't  want you  fucking  screwing up  the whole  program  I say  they didn't  check  I say  we have  a juiced  Olympics  how great  would that  be  just  watching  superheroes  that would  be amazing  because you  know I'm  all for that  because I don't  know these  people I don't  give a fuck  what happens  to them  if it makes  watching the  sport cooler  I'm all in  that would be  wild to watch  it's not even  a bit  I'm being  honest  how great  would that  be  javelin gets  tossed into  the crowd  right  fucking goes 
[00:20:30]  over the  entire field  and just  impales  somebody  right  people are  actually calling  about the  medical tape  like we do  care  oh stop it  already  I think we  have enough  knowledge  right  we got it  close enough  yeah  you can't  find the  hairy armpit  lady  what's her  name do we  know  hairy armpit  McGillicuddy  it's hard  to pronounce  why  just look  her up  by the  name  is she  from a  far away  land  yeah she's  definitely  from a  far away  land  but hairy  armpits  don't just  turn me on  if the girl's  not sexy  I don't just  like pits

[00:25:30]  underwater  cam  and then I  watched the  beach volleyball  and without  the bikinis  it's not  worth watching  it really  makes you  see that  that's why  you watch  it should  be part of  the rules  the Olympics  should make  a rule  you gotta wear  bikinis on the  beach volleyball  yeah  why else  would you  watch  well you  know  for five  minutes  it's kind  of like  oh wow  she blocked  that one  oh spike  oh look at  that  and then you're  just kind  of like  meh  a sport  without a  volley  sticks 
[00:26:00]  volleyball  has no  real  volleys  hmm  it really  don't  it's a  set up  and then  point  okay  point  or a  block  and then  the other  people can't  get to it  get a  a very  slight  volley  yeah  a tiny  bit  yeah  if it goes  back and  forth like  three times  you're amazed  oh that's  almost impossible  in beach  volleyball  almost  I mean  tennis  sometimes  you get  into  I'm not  a huge  tennis fan  but when  they get  excuse me 
[00:26:30]  they get  a really  good volley  going  you're like  holy fuck  who's gonna  win this  point  yeah  look at  the girl  look at  him  he's like  a little  baby  Jerry  Seinfeld  fucking hilarious  the one where  he's playing  tennis  with Milos  and Milos  stuck  sucked  yeah  I don't  know  fucking  that's one  of my  favorite  episodes  really  hey  Jerry  what's  doing  he's trying  to impress  his girlfriend  but he  can't play  tennis  so he  was asking  Jerry to  let him 
[00:27:00]  win  so Jerry  was letting  him win  but every  time he  like Jerry  would on  purpose  miss  Milos  should be  like  look at  him  he's not  even a  real  man  he's  just bashing  him  of course  Jerry  can't  take  it  and starts  really  playing  you've  obviously  seen  every  Seinfeld  episode  multiple  times  I will  watch it  whenever  it's on  I just  can't  stop  how many  times have  you seen  individual  episode  of Seinfeld  all right  on the  average  fair enough  fair enough  probably seen  each episode  an average 
[00:27:30]  of  wow  a lot  probably  fucking  25  times  average  yes  I swear  no way  I swear  just over  the years  you sure  wow  really  you love  Seinfeld  don't you  it's just  such a  funny  fucking  show  I gotta  watch it  every  there's  certain parts  that'll just  make me laugh  every goddamn  time  the ones  that I've  seen  I'm always  impressed  structurally  how brilliant  they were  at putting  together  it's just  fucking amazing  just great 
[00:28:00]  and it's like  for years  he did it  and he does  it on  curb  yeah  he's a  fucking  bonafide  genius  yep  and a lunatic  yeah  see  this is  they're  yeah  they're  in full  suits  yeah  they're all  fucking  this is very  bothersome  by the way  I just thought  of how  Colin Quinn  would assassinate  me for saying  he's a  bonafide  genius  talking about  oh  Jesus  right  yes  bonafide  I would  get murdered  for that  justifiably  you're a  bonafide  ass  yeah  I really 
[00:28:30]  am  is he  bonafide  yeah  I'm a fool  oh  it's okay  I  I told  a guy  with  no feet  yesterday  that he  was a  legend  oh boy  he didn't  like that  what  why  I'm  working  this one  guy  for a  while  and  I'll  eventually  get video  he will  not let  me  film him  and  I've  been  working  him  a little  bit  I see  him  every  once  in  a  while  what  is  he  a  homeless  guy  yeah  he's  begging  for money  for his  diabetes  medicine  and  he's 
[00:29:00]  got  no  feet  and  they're  literally  open  wounds  and  people  walk  by  this  guy  horrified  oh  jesus  film him  anyway  yeah  what's  he  gonna  do  chase  you  down  yeah  there's  anyone  you can  you can  film at  will  I actually  got no  feet  I actually  instead of  doing like a  guerrilla filming  I want to  actually do  something with  the guy  yeah  but I  called him  a legend  yesterday  oh boy  he didn't  like that  why  and then  I told  him he  was  funny  yeah  I  really  said  you're  funny  have  you ever  tried  like  stand-up 
[00:29:30]  stand-up  would be  an amazing  feet  and  he goes  does this  look funny  to you  I'm like  I'm not  saying it's  funny that  you don't  have feet  like I  have these  open  conversations  with the  guy  I'm not  saying it's  funny that  you don't  have feet  but you're  a funny  guy  you got  a good  personality  that's  all I'm  saying  well I  don't  find  this  funny  I'm  like  I'm  not  saying  this  is  funny  I'm  saying  you  have  a  personality  and  you  are  funny  how 
[00:30:00]  you  the  conversation  had an  when  oh  well you  guys will  appreciate  this  then we  were arguing  over it  it cost me  20 bucks  yesterday  just to  hang out  and talk  to him  a little  bit  and  I gave  him 10  and  he goes  you didn't  give me  10  I'm like  now you're  lying  because I'm  not lying  you didn't  give me  that 10  I'm like  holy shit  I gave  you the  fucking  10  let's  all relax  here  right  so 
[00:30:30]  a guy  a black  guy in a  van  happened  to be  close  he was  watching  because the  conversation  was getting  a little  intense  yesterday  I almost  got to a  point  where I  could have  filmed him  and then  the guy  rolls down  his window  he goes  hey mister  I go  yeah  he goes  a guy  I tell  you  not that  it  matters  but  you  didn't  give him  the  10  you  put  it  back  in  your  wallet  I'm  like  what  and I  swear  I wasn't  trying to  fuck  with this  guy  out of  money  I  open up  my  wallet  after  insisting 
[00:31:00]  he goes  I gotta  tell you  something  he says  to me  he goes  you  you gotta  learn how  to understand  black people  I'm like  whoa  end of  conversation  this has  nothing to do  with black  and white  sorry  oh he's a  black guy  yeah but  the black  guy in the  van  goes look  man you  you weren't  doing a  black thing  with this  guy  you were  just having  a conversation  with him  he didn't  like that  you were  trying to  talk black  and you  kept saying  what  happened  to your  feats  I didn't  thought it  was racist  of you to  try to  talk in  what a  stereotypical  black way 
[00:31:30]  is  but I  go  man you're  a legend  he goes  a legend  how dare  you say  I'm a legend  why am I  a legend  this guy  just seems  confrontational  he's very  confrontational  that's why  I'm kind of  digging this  back and  forth  dude you  gotta film  him anyway  just stop  playing footloose  in front of  him  he's got  all his  toes are  completely  gone  and he  has like  a lot  of the  foot  after the  toes  is gone  and he  picks the  wound  you think  it smells  holy  fuck  man  Jesus 
[00:32:00]  Christ  that's  disgusting  and he  takes his  socks and  shoes off  because he  really wants  some sympathy  out there  I don't  blame him  obviously  do what  you gotta  do  but  why did  I bring  this up  I don't  know  why did  I bring  it up  there was  a reason  now I  forgot  but whatever  I will  get him  on video  damn  I don't  want a  confrontation  where he's  like don't  film me  yeah  tell him  go fuck  himself  because then  you can't  do anything  with that  type of  video  anyway  so  I think 
[00:32:30]  it'll cost  me about  a hundred  bucks  to film  him  yeah  we're  negotiating  do it  clandestinely  he said  $37  because that's  what he needs  for his  copay  so I was  willing to  give the  37  but as soon  as he knew  I was  willing to  give the  37  he's a  shyster  man  now he  goes  alright  I got  you for  the  37  now he's  trying to  get  50  50  and I  go no  I go  now I'm  not giving  you the  37  he goes  why  I go  because  you said  I could  film you  if I  give you  the 37  he goes  well now  it's  50  I go  well that  means 
[00:33:00]  now I'm  not giving  you the  37  it's a  whole  thing  I'm  an idiot  I'm  a nut  job  I'm sure  you could  just film  him  the news  doesn't ask  you should  just film  him  what's  he gonna  do  I'll go  back  I don't  want to  say where  he is  because I  don't want  anyone else  to get  the footless  guy  but he's  always in  the same  spot  these guys  always find  the same  spot  same  place  they got  their  territory  their  turf  but this  guy's  wow  no toes  on either  foot  wow  with just  a wide  open wound  I don't 
[00:33:30]  even know  how you  seal that  shit  because it's  too big  for I guess  the skin  to actually  come back  god  he's gotta  be dead  soon  you can't  live like  that  get some  kind of  fucking  blood  poisoning  I guess  if he had  health insurance  and all  that  I guess  you could  get some  kind of  skin graft  to cover  up the  area  I would  assume  what happened  where's  Obama  yes  chip  you usually  walk up  and go  to him  hey  I'm gonna  call you  a toe  trunk  call him  a toe  trunk  yeah 
[00:34:00]  then kick  where the  wound is  evil  fucking  just kick  where the  wound is  real hard  I think  that would  hurt him  it would  hurt to  get a  fucking  missing  toe  wound  kicked  by a  passerby  yeah  it all  started  because I  walked out  of this  place  that he  was in  front of  and I  gave him  five bucks  yeah  and I'm  like can I  film you  he goes  for five  dollars  so that's  how it  started  yeah for  five bucks 
[00:34:30]  you think  this is a  joke  freeloader  it's not a  joke  I just  want to  film you  I wasn't  even gonna  make fun  of him  I just  wanted to  get his  story on  camera  that's all  yeah  because it  was fucked  up  did he  tell you  his story  he just  has diabetes  and it's  getting worse  and he  needs you  know he  needs to  cover his  copay  but everyone  else was  giving change  and stuff  so I'm  like you  I go since  I've been  here you've  you've made  the thirty  seven dollars  his copay  he goes  my  insurance  I don't 
[00:35:00]  know I  think that's  part of the  scam too  yeah for  a copay  the only  thing that's  not a scam  is you  would have  to pay  premiums  the only  thing that's  not a scam  is the fact  that he  has no  toes  I think  everything  else is a  scam  everything  else is a  load of  shit  yeah and  then I  go I  watched you  you've  covered the  thirty seven  since I've  been here  because I  talked for  about 15  minutes  because it's  slow day  because of  the rain  they have  slow days  yeah he  entertained the  hell out of  me this is  the shit I  like just  fucking doing  I didn't get  too close  because I  really saw in 
[00:35:30]  his eyes that  he was seeing  if I could get  close enough so  he could strangle  the life out of  me he can't  really get around  very well I  would assume  he had a cane  and some shoes  he puts on  I go how do you  walk he goes on  my heels  that's how he  told me on  my heels  because he's  got heels  but no  fucking  no the rest  of his foot  is pretty  I mean there's  not much  disgusting  sticking out  from his  ankles  not much  probably half  of it I  would say  is still there  this guy ain't  going to be  around for  half the foot  and all the 
[00:36:00]  toes I know  the toes are  part of the  foot but you  know what I'm  saying you  take the toes  off and then  whatever's left  you take half  of that is  what I'm  getting at  crazy and  then he's  just sitting  there as  I'm talking  to him just  picking it  and I go  don't pick  it  now I feel  like I know  the guy  I'm like  don't pick  it  stop picking  that's fucking  terrible  the picking  it's terrible  I think out of  everything the  picking was way  worse than what  it looked like  yeah  for some reason  the picking was  my line like  oh my god  don't pick  it  it's terrible  even though  you're looking  at this open  I mean open  wound like if  you cut like a 
[00:36:30]  tree in half  and what you  would see inside  that's what  you're seeing  with this foot  gonna get  gangrene  you think  yeah  I asked him  I go you  keep that clean  he goes I  keep it clean  the street  without anything  on it  but I know  the answer  but I wanted  him to admit  it  you know  obviously  it brings  in more funds  you can't  just have it  all like  you know  all wrapped  up right  yeah  you have to  show what's  going on  and then the  people will  go holy shit  and they break  out their  wallets  because it's  kind of in  a touristy 
[00:37:00]  area  I mean the  tourists are  suckers in  New York  for all this  stuff  they just  panic and  open up their  wallets  like oh my  god make it  go away  and New Yorkers  they give the  look of  yeah nice  feet  they really  do  and they  walk away  or walk  around  so  I was just  watching some  of this  fencing  going on  the fencing  that's a  weird sport  too  it is  you should  say to them  when you see  that could be  like a geeky  sport I would  guess  like LARPers  go into  fencing  yeah 
[00:37:30]  sword play  is very  geeky  but  but someone  would call up  and go how  dare you  they're very  athletic  it's kind  of cool  I don't  know  I think  you're always  jabbing each  other in the  face  I think  I think it  would be cool  to do with  your friends  on a weekend  but to train  for your whole  life so you  can maybe  win a medal  at it  I don't see  that  but if they  had  why don't  they set  up a  fencing  like a  bowling  type of  situation  where you  go there  with your  friends  and instead  of bowling  you fence  each other  because guys  would just be 
[00:38:00]  whipping each  other with  the fucking  swords  protected  smack ass  with the  swords  you wouldn't  try fencing  smack ass  I would  try it  yeah  it kind  of looks  okay  they don't  really last  for very long  sitting there  doing like a  sword fight  thing  it's usually  just a lunge  and they  hit him  yeah I  don't I  don't even  know what  makes you  good at  it  yeah just 
[00:38:30]  jump in  and smack  the guy  it seems  like there's  a lot of  luck involved  like oh  fuck you  gotta be the  first one to  fucking touch  him with  the foil  yeah  yeah then  his helmet  lights up  yeah I  just thought  they were all  getting head  shots but it  turns out  wherever you  touch them  on the  body  yeah  then their  helmet  lights up  like rock  them sock  them robots  that'd be  cooler if  like the  part of the  body lights  up that  you hit  yeah let  us know  where you  hit him  yeah like  ball shots  and shit  yeah  all right  yeah so  that was my 
[00:39:00]  olympic  experience  last night  the beach  volleyball  drove me  nuts  no bikinis  and the  synchronized  diving  was  suspicious  yeah  I'm already  I'm already  tapping out  yeah I was  trying  but  kind of like  this is dull  dull  in a weird  way they've  become so  good at  their sport  it's just  I don't know  it's just too  almost robotic  yeah  they sort  of already  know who's  going to win  every event  yeah  really  down to a 
[00:39:30]  couple people  yeah it's  down to a  couple people  every time  they know  that going  into it  know one of  these underdogs  coming up and  doing well  I felt like  when we were  growing up with  the olympics  you saw more  underdogs  yeah  you're going to  see a few  sure  but not like  you used to  where holy  what this guy  came out of  nowhere  yeah the  the training  is so  advanced now  yeah  that I  don't think  leaves room  much room  for a true  underdog  yeah  to step  forward 
[00:40:00]  like everything  else  you got  enough money  you could  be good  at it  I was  explaining  is he  killed him  I don't know  I just fell  down  I was  explaining to  my wife  when we were  growing up  the olympics  were everything  remember you  would like  even if you  were at a  beach even  people were  just talking  about it  and yeah  and you  know we're  talking three  channels  yeah  the whole  the whole  world was  watching the  olympics at  the same  fucking time  yeah  and you  never got  results  remember like  when the  olympics were  in uh  where were 
[00:40:30]  some of the  places were  in growing  up  lake  placid  but they  held back  the the  information  unless you  made some  kind of weird  international  phone call  you were  not going  to get  the results  you know  what I mean  you couldn't  until like  yeah  so you  had to  wait  and you  knew the  event was  over  and you're  like oh  my god  did they  do it  you know  I gotta  wait for  tonight  yeah  isn't that  weird  to think  that they  were absolutely  able to still  hold back  information  to other  parts of the  world  you just get  instant info 
[00:41:00]  now  it's impossible  yeah  really is  impossible  to hold  it back  oh it  goes back  to your  point with  the nbc  trying to  you know  hold back  the results  yeah  good luck  everyone tweets  everyone tweets  and is Bob  Costas  enraging  what is it  about him  I fucking  turn him  right off  he's a smooth  ass broadcaster  but there is  something about  him I just  don't like  I just tune  him right  out  you know  yeah  what am I  gonna  I'm trying  I barely  watch the  athletes doing 
[00:41:30]  what they  do and that's  what the  olympics is  all about  not his  fucking  just ramblings  yeah why are  they showcasing  him  what does he  have to do  about the  what does he  have to do  with the  olympics  yeah  can't they  just have  a guy  like  all right  well here  here's the  fucking  volleyball  now  I know  yeah  they've  always  had  go back  to  Bob  Costas  and then  he has  to have  those  pre-produced  packages  for everything  they gotta  have the  guy that  you know  anchors  the whole  thing  no I guess  explains it  to us  I get  having the  anchor  let's go  back to  Jim  McKay  Jim  McKay 
[00:42:00]  knew how  to anchor  hey man  I'm  Jim  McKay  in here  we're  gonna go  to water  polo  now  and he  had some  real emotions  going on  yep  and they  didn't have  those  pre-packaged  pieces  for everything  nothing  does  removing  you know  when they  first hit  move me  off the  couch  when they  first hit  pool  right  when they  first hit  sports  if you  want a  real answer  they  they were  kind of  cool  yeah  they were  because it  was different  but now  they have  to do  it with  every  single 
[00:42:30]  thing  it's  overkill  not  everyone  has this  over the  top  traumatic  story  that needs  to be  told  with  powerful  music  and  slow  motion  video  right  yeah  some  people  are just  like  yeah  well  I'm here  let me  run  really  fast  Jerry  Sandusky  is very  upset  over the  NCAA  sanctions  on Penn  State  oh no  he got his  opinion on  it  he's very  upset  how did  we get  his  opinion  I don't  know  I guess  someone asked  him  I don't 
[00:43:00]  know  but he's  very  upset  I think  he's got  more to  be upset  about  nah  he don't  give a fuck  destroying  people's  lives  he don't  give a fuck  I would  assume he  knows he  got away  with murder  and this  is  for many  years  so to him  it's like  oh wow  you know  I got  another 10  15 years  in  before they  figured it  all out  Mrs. Sandusky  should be  fucking  thrown away  too  being a  blind  idiot  throw away  the key  throw away  the key  lock her up  and throw  away the key 
[00:43:30]  but it's so  stupid  what if  you had  to fucking  get in there  and get  them something  you threw  the key  away  how do  you get  in  what if  you want  to move  them to  a bad  cell  you gotta  call a  locksmith  hey we  threw away  the key  that was  irresponsible  of us  we understood  lock you  and why not  keep the key  it's not like  they have it  if you throw  the key  away  someone might  get it  to them  or you might  have a change  of mind  yourself  it's more  dangerous  to throw  the key  away  than to hold  on to it  you don't like  that expression  no it's just  how about  lock him up  and hide  the key  how about 
[00:44:00]  lock him up  and give  the key  to the guards  because they  tend to be  territorial about  it  how about  lock him up  and burn  him alive  yeah that sounds  fair like  fucking caretaker  right  gasoline in the  light bulb  I could wrap  my mind  around that  but just  throwing away  the key  who gives a  fuck  yeah because  they know  you have  a new one  made after  the guy  dies  how are you  to get  his body  out  he's gonna  lay there  and smell  yeah  damn threw  away the key  he's rotting  fuck  now what  yeah  he's shat  on the floor  we can't  clean it up  the smell  is all over  the cell house  where's the key  well you know 
[00:44:30]  what you told  me to do  with it  I've tossed  in the trash  it's in the  waste paper  basket  I hate a lot  of those  sayings  that's just  awful  throw away  the key  my  probably number  one is when  people go  well you got  your Anthony  Cumia's  Jim Norton's  and your Sam  Roberts  your Opie's  pluralizing  people's names  I fucking  hate that  what does  that mean  thank you  Kenny's  got your 
[00:45:00]  club  started  Kenny's  yeah  what does  that mean  putting you  into a little  category  yeah it's just  kind of making  a subcategory  category of  one  yeah  silly  it's dumb  that's my  number one  I think  yeah that is  a dumb one  and it's  overused too  it is  Americans who  win gold medals  what a lovely  country we live in  I guess it's  Americans and not  other countries  I guess the  other countries  depending on what  their tax codes  are  yeah other  countries have  different tax codes  certainly  Americans though  for every gold  medal  yeah  they owe  the good old 
[00:45:30]  IRS  nine thousand  fucking dollars  nine thousand  nine thousand  American and the  IRS can't look the  other way and go  you know what  this is just a nice  thing for fucking  national pride  national pride  let's let's let  this one slide  let them slide  well they get  they give them  25 G's  along with the gold  medal you get  25 grand  and that's what  they're getting  that's being  taxed  it's ridiculous  it's like  fucking  what an  embarrassing  fucking country  this is  it really is  an embarrassing  fucking country  and the sad  part is  most of these  Olympic athletes  will never make 
[00:46:00]  money off their  off their  accomplishments  it's very rare  that they get  endorsement deals  like  you hear about  guys all the  time selling  their gold medals  for a quick  few bucks  you know  $25,000 to win  a gold medal  and if you don't  get the endorsements  you spend that  like that  it's nothing  $9,000  because they got  to be amateurs  to begin with  obviously  so they can't  even really  make money  off their  sport  until they  finally say  okay  I'm done  with the  sport  well they  change that  a little bit  right  some of these 
[00:46:30]  guys can make  endorsements  after the  Olympics  like Michael  Phelps certainly  made a shitload  of money  after the Olympics  Bruce Jenner  did  but not everyone  gets that  opportunity  and then the  tax the guys  $9,000  for fucking  you know  performing  for your  country  it's embarrassing  it's an  embarrassing  thing  it's embarrassing  right  yeah  the way  they tax  us  it's beyond  me  we just  agreed to  it over  the years  and it  affects  everybody  it's easy  to go after  the rich  people  but it  affects  everybody 
[00:47:00]  you know  the government  has got to  get their  shit in  order  50%  of people  that don't  pay  anything  if I felt  like the  government  was  yeah  exactly  if I felt  like the  government  was taking  care of  their own  people  and their  own shit  then maybe  I would  understand  maybe  no you  know what  I would  probably  would  understand  believe it  or not  you got to  sit there  and watch  them spend  irresponsibly  and then they  just come  crawling back  and asking  you for  more  it's like  it's like  your  it's like  your brother  or something  is a  fucking  drug addict  and they  keep coming 
[00:47:30]  back to you  to buy  drugs  and there's  nothing you  can do  about it  you know  I understand  why  people  I'm not  talking about  this Colorado  shooter  but when  people walk  into government  offices  now I'm not  saying you  should do  that  but we've  all had  those frustrating  feelings where  it's such a  bigger entity  than you  and people  are like  well how  could they  just walk  in and start  shooting people  because the  way you're  treated  is like  you're facing  this faceless  organization  who has no 
[00:48:00]  caring about  your situation  you can't make  an impact  on them  I can't help  you sir  that's the way  we do it  sir  sir  I'm sorry  we're sorry  for your  inconvenience  sir  while you're  on the  phone  there's not  one ounce  of humanity  or connection  from them  and it's the  power to destroy  your life  in the interim  here  absolutely  so if you're  crazy  I can understand  why you think  again I'm  certainly not  encouraging people  to do that  no no no  but I mean  people are like  well how can  they realize 
[00:48:30]  they're shooting  people  because they're  not treating  you like  people  they're not  behaving like  individuals  or treating  you like  one  it literally  is like  a fucking  robot  that is just  plugged into  human beings  and spitting  out information  to you  there's no way  you can go  no but this  is what  happened  and they go  oh  you never hear  that during  a conversation  oh  your whole  thing on  twitter about  united  was infuriating  me  it was infuriating  to read  well I got  I finally did  resolve that  I gave a 
[00:49:00]  brief synopsis  of what they  my flight  got cancelled  and I'll be  very brief  with this  my flight  got cancelled  because of  weather  which is  understandable  the lady  behind the  desk at  united  hands me  a ticket  for air  canada  which is  their star  alliance  partner  so I go  there with a  ticket in my  hand  she tells me  you give  this and you  can board  the plane  I get there  there's no  flight for me  they say we're  not honoring  this  so the united  rep from  la guardia  after I paid  130 for a cab  is now arguing  with the air  canada people  saying this 
[00:49:30]  has to happen  they're saying  no  their highest  person there  refuses it  turns out  the united  lady from  newark  should have  called air  canada  because within  24 hours  I think the  airline has  the right to  refuse  passengers  okay  it was a  miscommunication  I pay  1500  for a ticket  to go  830 that  night  that's all  that's  available  so I want  united to  reimburse me  because I  paid 440  for my  original ticket  and I want to  reimburse me  this is what  it cost me  to get the  ticket  and then  united is 
[00:50:00]  saying to me  this fucking  guy in  Hawaii  this motherfucker  this customer  service rep  in Hawaii  is saying to  me  well sir  I mean  you didn't  we don't  this cocksucker  said monies  he said to me  we're not  responsible for  monies  spent on  other airlines  and I said  I understand  that if your  flight was  cancelled  and I  voluntarily  went to  LaGuardia  and couldn't  get on  but your  lady handed  me a ticket  and told 
[00:50:30]  me it was  good  so you  put me in  a position  where that  was the  only flight  available  I could have  went to  JFK and  flown American  I could have  flown Delta  I could have  waited here  for a later  flight  you did  put me  in that  position  he would  not bend  so out of  $1500  he wanted  to refund  my ticket  and give  me a $300  travel voucher  I said  why do you  want me  the customer  to eat  hundreds of  dollars  when a  direct mistake  by your  agent  did this  why would  you want  me to  eat this  money  how can 
[00:51:00]  you  in good  conscience  ask me  to eat  this  it's  ridiculous  wouldn't  bend  and he  eventually  hung up  on me  he goes  I'm going  to have  to terminate  this call  because I'm  a platinum  flyer but I'm  not a 1k  flyer and he  kept reminding  me I only  took this  as a courtesy  sir  I only took  this call  as a courtesy  which was a  way of saying  take what I  give you  yeah that's  not courtesy  when you tell  someone it's a  courtesy call  it's not  I was so  aggravated  at this  guy's  smug  and he  wasn't rude  we didn't  curse 
[00:51:30]  and I said  he was on  the phone  with me  for a while  but I said  so you're  going to  hang up  on me  and he  goes yes  I'm going  to  I have  to terminate  this call  I said  I'm not  yelling  I'm not  being rude  and then  click  he hung  up on me  and I  told him  you're  going to  lose me  over 400  or 500  bucks  whatever it  was  I said  you're  willing  to lose  me  as a  customer  so I  got on  Twitter  on a  rant  and I  was like  you know  what  okay  you want  to fuck  me for  1500  well I  will simply  tell the  truth  about what  happened  and enough  people  who have  choices 
[00:52:00]  I'm not  going to  bring down  United Airlines  but there  are people  who go  who do  we fly  you know  fuck them  it's going  to be more  than the money  they could  have reimbursed  a lot more  than the money  they cost me  you're going  to get your  1500 back  easily  in another  way  tenfold  because most  people when  they're going  somewhere for  vacation  airlines are  comparable  do you want  to fly  American  I don't  give a  shit  so that's  how you  eventually  win  and I'm  sure a few  people will  do that  for you  but I did  speak to  another rep  from  because I  called  some fan  on Twitter  sent me 
[00:52:30]  contact  information  for the  high up  so I  called  the office  left a  message  woman  called  me  the next  day  and I  explained  my whole  thing  to her  and then  she was  saying  to me  well we  didn't  twist  your arm  sir  and make  you  and I  said  again  by putting  me in  that position  under the  guise of  having an  airline ticket  you absolutely  did twist  my arm  of course  you did  and she  goes well  United would  have issued  you a ticket  the next  day  and I'm  like but  that's  I miss  why I  had to  be there  and I  could have  gone to  another  airline  I said  if it's  just a 
[00:53:00]  flight  cancellation  you're  right  but you  gave me  and she  goes well  it's not  our  responsibility  I said  you gave  me a ticket  without  calling them  like you  were supposed  to do  to confirm  that it  was in fact  a ticketed  reservation  it's not  our  responsibility  to know  the policies  of our  airline  I said  you're  saying  to me  that as  a member  of the  star  alliance  you're  in business  with Air  Canada  but it's  not your  responsibility  to know  their  policies  it's  mine  the consumer  I'm like 
[00:53:30]  you would  have me  eat that  money  when you  the air  like they  were so  intent  on being  right  and then  something  in our  and again  she wasn't  neither of  them were rude  to me  I can't  say they  were  she said  to me  hold on  a minute  like she  looked at  you back  she called  me back  15 minutes  later  sir I went  into the  records  and I'm  sorry  she said  I didn't  realize  this happened  I forget  whatever it  was  something  with the  date  change  she goes  here's  what I'm  going to  do 
[00:54:00]  they  refunded  my ticket  and gave  me a  $900  travel voucher  so I think  I was at  like $100  so I was  fine with  that  she gave  me  pretty much  what I  had asked  for  which was  just to  break even  like I  didn't want  anything  this was not  a punitive  damage  getting a  settlement  yeah I  wasn't  saying  because  the guy  when the  guy was  saying to  me  the day  before  sir I'm  offering  I'm like  you're not  doing me a  favor  I'm like  I'm not  looking for  hey you  inconvenienced  me what  can I get  I'm like  I'm not  trying to  do that  I just  want what  you cost  me  I just  want what's  mine  but she 
[00:54:30]  actually did  the right  thing and so  I was fine  with that  but when you're  dealing with a  company like  that like  when I told  that guy  I told  that guy  I'll go  on the air  and I won't  slander the  company  I'll simply  tell what  happened  and I knew  he wouldn't  care  and that's  why I said  it because I  knew he wouldn't  care  they don't  give a shit  like they  don't care  if they lose  you  and this  woman did  and she  called me  back  but when you're  dealing with a  company like  that now  imagine dealing  with the  government  who's worse  than the  because the 
[00:55:00]  airlines can  be bent  if you  call enough  people  because they  are more  customer service  oriented than the  government is  what I heard  in there  unfortunately  is  I mean  good for you  you got a  phone number  that the  average Joe  doesn't get  right  you got to  a level  where they  will get  things done  thanks to  the fan  if you could  figure out  what that  phone number  is  or if you  got the  inside track  like you  did  but the  average  people  that this  happens to  you know  the level  of phone  numbers  that you  have at 
[00:55:30]  your disposal  isn't going  to get much  done  I always  ask  as soon as  I have an  issue  I'm like  I don't  want to  talk to  you  who is the  right now  I do it  all the time  and they get  really insulted  and they try  to fight back  a little  I'm like  no I don't  want to talk  to you  you're nobody  you're nobody  who is your  superior  who is your  boss  I want to  talk to  that person  immediately  it's amazing  how they  protect the  companies  it's almost  like I  understand  protecting  the revenue  of the  company  because it  is your  job  and the  public  are greedy  pigs  I do  get that 
[00:56:00]  but the  guy the  day before  acknowledged  to me  that the  agent was  wrong  not to  call over  he goes  I can't  give you  the full  ticket  I said  by refunding  my $400  you're  acknowledging  that her  mistake  makes me  entitled  to that $400  why won't  you acknowledge  that you owe  me the money  I spent  on another  ticket to  make up  for that  mistake  it was my  only up  why is it  when it's  their mistake  they can only  give you  some of it  back  that's amazing  why do we  split the  difference  when it's  your mistake  I said to  him would 
[00:56:30]  you take  less on  your check  dude  I wasn't  even yelling  at him  I can't  get in  a hypothetical  he was a  condescending  smug dude  the woman  the next day  was much  more helpful  and the sad  part is  these people  have the same  shit happen  in their  regular lives  so they  almost should  understand  but I think  they get off  on it  you want to  shit on  somebody else  I think  they get off  on the fact  that it's  sort of a  power trip  of course  it is  but the  government  is even  worse  because the  government  is unbendable  when it comes  to that  at least  this way  they are  a customer  based 
[00:57:00]  operation  so you'll  find somebody  if you go  a little bit  higher  that does care  about your  satisfaction  I was going  to go  all the way  up to  Jeff Smizek  the president  or the vice  president  as much  as I could  I would have  gotten through  to one of them  with a letter  or an email  eventually  they'll hear you  government  doesn't give a fuck  they don't give a fuck  plus the fact  most people  wouldn't continue  like you did  you give up  along the way  because it's  just so infuriating  you're like  you know what  it's not worth  me getting sick over 
[00:57:30]  so you fucking  go oh well  you know  and you drop it  it just makes me  feel bad  like you said  because I'm lucky  I have a fan base  I can go on Twitter  and people really do  help you  because people  understand the  frustration  and they understand  that just because  you do  I do radio  or I'm a comic  doesn't mean  I don't deal  with the same  bullshit  so they want  to help  and it's almost  like they want  to help  because they know  when they deal  with it  nobody helps  them  and the fans  were great man  they really did  help me a lot  and I know  United read  those tweets  and I hope  if we discuss  it on the show  maybe there's  a little change 
[00:58:00]  maybe it helps  someone else  down the road  who knows  who knows  alright  we should break  zip lines  in New York  nice  I told you  this would happen  Zip lines  I said this  years ago  that they should  put zip lines  in New York City  it would be  a huge success  that guy from  England  looked very silly  oh that's  yeah that was  the English  man  but they shut  down major  streets in  New York City  in the summer  and I think  it's starting  this weekend  I think they do  it for the next  couple weekends  at the very least  that's wild 
[00:58:30]  and I hear  they're adding  zip lines  this year  pretty cool  I think it's  very cool  I guess we  don't have to  discuss that  anymore  because that's  all I have  I'm on eat  alright let's  eat then  I'm hungry  Serious Serious  XS  The O.P.  and Anthony  Show

[01:00:00]  he's been dead  a while  sex torture  I'm going to go  with  how long ago  was the sex  torture  22 years ago  damn  I have a nice  picture of all  of us together  I got that one  you have the four  of us  me you guys  and Rick James  back in  NAW  I'm going to  break down  all my old  celebrity pictures  from the  NAW days  boy do we  look young  we look  fucking young  holy shit  a lot of people  tell me I look  the same though 
[01:00:30]  you kind of do  no one tells you  that  I just wanted  to put a compliment  myself in there  you kind of do  though I think  because you keep  your hair the same  way  and I'm still  boyish and eager  like my eyes  I still bat my  eyes at information  well I wouldn't  say that  yes right guys  do you know  what I watched  recently the  Chappelle sketch  for Rick James  I don't know why  I got into one  of those YouTube  loops  it really is funny  man  it's one of the  best  just hearing Rick  James talk  who the fuck  is Charlie Murphy  man Rick James 
[01:01:00]  fuck that  motherfucker  and they kept  saying nigga this  nigga that  that was a  funny show  man  it really was  what lost his  mind  what the fuck  I don't know  what happened to  Dave  Jesus  you were on top  of the mountain  I was watching  his stand up  too  and again  I was probably  in a 15 minute  Chappelle loop  because again  I never watched  guys I just  would see them  in the clubs  and I watched  probably a 10  minute hunk of  him doing a gig  in 2004  recently  just great  it was great  I was an eager  boy growing up 
[01:01:30]  on Long Island  and we'd come  into the city  to go to  these TV shows  that was our  thing as a family  we went and  saw Phil Donahue  a lot  we saw  Montel Williams  a lot  Sally  Jessie  Raphael  and then we  would get the  Letterman tickets  too  and I remember  going to Letterman  I don't know  how old I was  I guess someone  could do the math  and fucking  Dave Chappelle  was a 17 year  old comic  on Letterman  and he fucking 
[01:02:00]  destroyed  I remember it  like it was  yesterday  I'm like  who is this  guy  I didn't know  who he was  yet  but he was  already famous  at 17  I guess  he was getting  there  maybe even  18  maybe  but I mean  no more  than that  his first  big one  that I  remember  was  the Arsenio  Hall show  and I believe  he dedicated  his set  to a comedian  named Charlie  Barnett  who was in  DC Cab  and you guys  remember Charlie  he died of AIDS  oh did he  yeah he was  I only worked  with him a couple  of times 
[01:02:30]  one real gig  and then once  the Boston  Comedy Club  he was  apparently cast  on SNL  and then couldn't  read or wasn't  a good reader  and then  the rumor  is that  that's how  Eddie Murphy  got it  because they  needed the  black guy  but the original  guy was supposed  to be  and Eddie Murphy  got it because  the other guy  couldn't read  or maybe they  brought in other  people  and Murphy  was brought  in for it  I mean I don't  know the full  story  but Charlie  Barnett  he was in DC  Cab  he's the guy  that was  like Irene  Cara  and he was  a street  performer 
[01:03:00]  he would be  in Washington  Square Park  and when I  watched the one  time we did  was poor  Billy's in  Jersey for  Vinny  and when he  performed he  would kind of  leave the mic  there and he  was just loud  and he was  very funny  and really  like the guy  would just stand  in the fucking  park and make  people laugh  tough gig  and I think  he kind of  discovered  Chappelle or  one of the  guys who  first saw  Tony Woods  another guy  we know  Tony  you know  Tony's a  fucking  brilliantly  funny dude  and Charlie  so he dedicated  this to Charlie 
[01:03:30]  and Arsenio  how does this  guy look  the one  Jimmy's talking  about  Charlie Barnett  he had really  big fingernails  I'm trying to  remember  I'm sure  as soon as I  see his  picture  I'll go  oh that  you know  some guys  have really  weird  long fingernails  but you know  those guys  they have  those weird  fingernails  Charlie Barnett  if I remember  had those  fingernails  let me see  him  he's dead  he died  yeah  I kind of  remember him  oh yeah  I do remember  him  put Charlie  in a DC cab  put him in  from DC cab  maybe that's  how long ago 
[01:04:00]  did he go  I want to say  mid 90s  97 maybe  98  Becky Barnett  could have been  after that  you guys  AIDS huh  yeah  he was  oh boy  that's what I  heard  at least I  hope that's  true  you just  kind of  throw it  out there  but  yeah  so Dave  when you watch  Tony Woods  you can see  some Dave  Tony and Dave  because Tony's  older  that man  that  these guys 
[01:04:30]  that have  this  like Tony  I went to  Guantanamo Bay  with him  and Jeff Ross  and that  son of a  bitch  I guess he  was in the  Navy at one  point  did 45  minutes  on the  Navy  yeah  he was just  he's a guy  that can  literally be  funny  about  anything  for as long  as he  fucking  wants  yeah  it's depressing  to watch  a guy  like Tony  Woods  who's not  as famous  as he should  be  like a lot  of people  know him  right  but Tony  Woods  should be  fucking  household  name  famous  he is a  funny fuck  they liked him 
[01:05:00]  huh  oh  because he knew  but again  you nobody  you don't want  you don't want  to go on  after Tony  on a set  like that  huh  because he's  he's a guy  who never  he looks amazing  in everything  he wears  he's one of  those guys  that can wear  he can  he can  fucking  he can wear  two turnip  bags  and he'd be  like wow  that must have  been expensive  he's just a guy  that looks good  in clothes  and has this  really weird  quiet  man  like this  DC accent  thing  that just  captivates people  and Chappelle  can do that too  Chappelle can sit 
[01:05:30]  on stage for  four hours  and you  nobody moves  it's a gift  to be able  to do that  because that's  one reason  he's so funny  is because  he can explore  every bit  of material  because he doesn't  have to rush  to a laugh  he always gets  to one  but he doesn't  have to rush  because he has  this captivating  fucking  present  you want to  listen to him  I love the comics  that you just  want to listen  to as well  you don't need  a laugh  every two minutes  and I feel like  when I'm on stage  I'm panicking  and staving off  everything I do 
[01:06:00]  is a desperate  attempt  to block  the exits  you try to  distract them  anything  to keep them  a mass exodus  from happening  that's hilarious  I'm basically  just juggling  in between thoughts  don't leave  don't leave  don't leave  hi  oh my god  hopefully they'll  see the shiny  things  get this  drag  but Dave  when you watch  him man  he's such a  unique looking  guy  he owns it  he owns that  state  Dave Chappelle  was 17  by the way  in 1990  so I guess 
[01:06:30]  I saw Letterman  in 1990  with Chappelle  if that's about  it  yeah wow  so Chappelle's  not even 40 yet  he's been doing  comedy since he was  like 15 though  he was one of  those guys  who was  22 years ago  so he's like  38, 39  years old now  39  I guess  yeah  that's it  yeah  I feel like  we've known  him our whole  lives  yeah I mean  my whole career  I've been aware  of him  right  you know  what I mean  this guy  Dave Chappelle  Dave Chappelle  38  wow  I ran into him  in the green room  at Caroline's  I almost got him  to come on the show  hey man 
[01:07:00]  hey man  knew exactly  who we were  I'm like  come on in man  everyone else  does a show  hey man  maybe I'll do that  he just stopped  in to do a set  I forgot who was  playing that  maybe  no I don't know  if it was Burr  I don't remember  whatever  it doesn't matter  but I was just  hanging in the green room  as you know  we do  all of a sudden  he walked in  because he was  looking for a little  time that night  hey man  he really does have  this  this unique  ability  to hold a crowd  to be able to do it  for that long 
[01:07:30]  yeah  he's a very good  comic man  really a great  comic actually  that's not  news breaking  by the way  I don't think  that I'm  I don't think  I'm putting people  on to this young  kid  new young  upstart  I just was  watching some  YouTube stuff  I think the point  is and then  he just goes  away like he  did  unbelievable  I don't know  why  really unbelievable  because he's got  so much  fucking talent  what a waste  I don't know  if it's his choice  I don't know  what the fuck  at this point 
[01:08:00]  Dave can do  probably still  whatever he wants  to do  he's almost  at legendary  status because  of leaving  Comedy Central  but I feel  bad for the  guys on his  show  like Charlie  who I met  casually and  don't know  but Donnell  Rollins is a  buddy of mine  and he was  Ashy Larry  on that show  and it's like  one more season  they needed  like the two  seasons were  amazing  but that third  one or a  fourth one  would have just  put it  over the top  just would have  put it over the  top  so frustrating 
[01:08:30]  for those guys  because Dave's a  made man  even though  I was like  wow  why'd you do  that  he's still  a made guy  Dave can do  whatever the  fuck Dave  wants to do  those guys  man  sorry  well that's  okay  I'm just  watching a  shitload of  black guys  get chased out  of the store  by a grandma  with a pistol  and she was  shooting too  right  yeah  granny get  your gun  yeah  see  they were  falling over  there's nothing  better than  security footage  of guys  falling over  themselves to get  away from  somebody shooting  at them  like they're  running away 
[01:09:00]  from a monster  in a horror film  great  that is  fantastic  Macaulay Culkin  is hurting  what's wrong  with Macaulay  well I mean  his reps are  denying it  but a big  story yesterday  in what  the National  Enquirer  National Enquirer  has a pretty  good track  record  there used  to be a  time where  you saw  shit in  the National  Enquirer  you're like  alright  stop making  up shit  but their  track record  is pretty damn  good and  they're basically  saying that  Macaulay Culkin  is a heroin  addict  right  and Dick  it was  what 
[01:09:30]  powerful  painkillers  I think  they said  in the  article  is that  true Sam  I don't  want to  be misquoted  well  I don't  want to  be sued  by the  Macaulay  estate  the Macaulay  Culkin  Macaulay Culkin  estate  he looks  weird  these days  well remember  that picture  that came  out  that picture  probably  came out  about a  year ago  at this  point  where they  caught him  on the  street  it's  really  you don't  see him  much  anymore  but that  picture  I think  most of  us have  seen it  by now  just looking  all like  I mean 
[01:10:00]  lack of a  better way  to say  this  cracky  yeah  it's very  fucking  druggish  like his  face  and his  body  language  moving in  on  just a  way  that  it seems  like you  wouldn't  move  like that  if you  were  kind  of  sober  anyway  they're  now saying  that it  could be  heroin  right Sam  yeah  heroin  and prescription  drugs  so pills  to the  home alone  guy  home alone  guy  another guy  that had  the world  by the  balls  but his  rep is  saying  had more  money than  he would  ever need  the report  in the  national  inquiry 
[01:10:30]  that  macaulay  calkin  is addicted  to heroin  and assorted  hallucinogenics  is not only  categorically  without merit  but is also  impossibly  and ridiculously  fictitious  we beseech  we beseech  the responsible  media  to consider  the source  and its  reputation  who's the  source  the inquirer  and who's  saying this  his reps  well his reps  aren't going  to say  well okay  you're right  we're hoping  to hold it  back  now it's  out there  that's a  pretty intense  denial though  that really  is  yeah yeah  that's what  you need  to do  though  and you  got to  sue  yeah 
[01:11:00]  if it's  not true  then you  sue  they've  lost a lot  of lawsuits  but I mean  they are right  a lot more  than they're wrong  yeah  and they know  the lawsuits  are right  around the  corner  so I think  they felt  like they  had enough  to go  with it  you know  so who  knows  the little  fucking  home alone  kid  just smacking  his face  and going  oh  where's my  hair  away  now he's  smacking  his face  trying to  find a  vein  shoot up 
[01:11:30]  in his  eyeball  yeah  he's  sitting on  the  I think  I can get  one here  man  chip  just  petered  out  petered  out  fucking  zooted  that's  what  he's  doing  home  along  getting  zooted  and what  makes  today  difference  you're  right  you're  implying  that  chip  peters  out  I'm  not  gonna  say  that  people  adore  chip  oh yeah  he's  adored  he's  adored  yeah  and he's  also  a 
[01:12:00]  windowed  ah  that's  a good  one  I know  that is  a good  one  he's  a garbage  Jesus  people are  sending Charlie  Barnett clips  maybe  Iraq can  find one  for the  break  really  when we  break again  whenever that  is  it's fine  Charlie  Barnett  ah  wow  so alright  we'll have to wait on the Macaulay Culkin thing to see how that  see if it's a lie or not that's our entertainment news  it's saying  well where the fuck has he been holy shit  six months to live is what the inquirer said  what  that's what they said  that's a bold statement 
[01:12:30]  it is  just saying you're addicted to something  and then saying he's got six  well why would they say that  six months to live  he could go at any moment  seriously  how are they phrasing that though Sam  I guarantee you they're phrasing that in a way  where six months to live is there  but they're saying a source tells us that if he continues  right  how does it say it  this is not  this is an article about the article  okay  well if you find that  just read it while I kiss your neck  I'm not going to let you kiss my neck  our court system sucks  explain this one to me 
[01:13:00]  remember the Hasidic boy last year in Brooklyn  the man who killed him  yes  dragged him up to his what  his attic or whatever  and just a horrific death  for this poor Hasidic boy  yeah  he will likely spend  the rest of his life in jail  under plea  that means they were going for the death penalty  right  sure  but the fact is  they don't use the death penalty in New York  they refuse to use the death penalty in New York  even though we have it  so what's the plea about  that's a fake plea  I have an answer for you  for real  I do 
[01:13:30]  that was at the parents request  he's got 40 years  he's 36  they say he'll probably die in jail  the parents  they said if the parents wanted the trial  they would have gone ahead with it without a plea  because they had enough  but the parents wanted to avoid  a horrible lengthy trial  where you have to hear about how he died  and I think  I was reading the thing  and they said that  you don't want to hear about your baby's wounds  because it was very very sad  oh it's horrible  I read some of that shit  they said the kid was on his way home 
[01:14:00]  they said he got lost  looking for his mother  the first time he walked alone  and this fucking cocksucker  snatched him off the street  kept him in for a day  probably sexually abusing him of course  and then panicked  and smothered him  when he realized  there was such an intense manhunt for the kid  but you're afraid of monsters  when you're young  and you're walking home  the first time he was lost  looking for his mother  and this fucking  it's like where's all this thing 
[01:14:30]  with convicts  having this  this fucking  yeah  hey convicts don't go for that  where is it  where are all these pedophiles  being killed by prisoners  right  these high profile guys  are well protected  that's part of it  and maybe it doesn't happen  like we assume  yeah where's all this chivalry in prison  so they wanted an honor  but they wanted to avoid the trial  but if you're the guy  wouldn't you go  well I have nothing to lose  I want the trial  maybe I could get this knocked down  in 25 years or something  no because  I guess his lawyer advised him against it 
[01:15:00]  I don't know  but I mean I think that there was  even something as horrific as this  they wouldn't use the death penalty for  it's just amazing  why do we even have it  just to satisfy  that's what they do now  it's like alright  we'll satisfy some people  we'll get the death penalty  in New York  but we'll never use it  that'll be our loophole  we'll never use it though  his lawyer is saying he's crazy  like his lawyer said  well too bad  I don't give a fuck  no I know  I'm just  I have emotion  I don't give a fuck 
[01:15:30]  you're crazy  you should die  who gives a fuck  you're crazy  I don't give a fuck  I don't give a fuck  of the circumstances  this innocent boy is dead  because you're a fucking monster  you should die  period  period  fucking  despicable  huh  despicable  why doesn't a convict  just lunge at his throat  with a shank or something  fucking  he's protected  but he's not  constantly away from people  well we'll see  yeah  that's the type of thing  I'd like to see happen 
[01:16:00]  yeah  oh boy  you gotta look at  he's not gonna last long  really  I bet he does  yeah  he looks like a real creep  shit  my ascetic friend  oh yeah  I always said to him  what happened to Jesus  why'd you guys reject  oh who's this  he'd send me a picture  we quit arguing  oh god  that's a big story 
[01:16:30]  today  and then you got  the Somali comedian  who made fun of Islam  yeah  what a shock  he was shot for it  dead  shocking  dead  shocking  dead  you know  it's a peaceful religion  let's just stop already  dead  and I want to hear  all the outrage  like you know  and I mentioned it on Twitter  not to quote myself  but I want to see  people  condemn Muslims  for killing a comedian  as harshly  as they would condemn  a comic  for mocking Islam  like where are 
[01:17:00]  all the politicians  today  for all these people  who would be attacking  a comic  right  where the fuck are you  yeah  not gonna happen  no there's  no one's got any courage  when it comes to that  where did this Somalian  comic do his  on the radio  where  I don't know  but I mean  he walked off the radio  he may have been a radio comic  or whatever  but he came off the air  and he was shot  by two gun men  of course  what country  we don't even know that  Somalia  Somalia  oh it was in Somalia  oh yeah  they have radio in Somalia  oh yeah 
[01:17:30]  got comedians in Somalia  they said he was a very  loved guy  but it's terrible  this guy was fucking killed  for teasing  this really radical  whatever  and they fucking  murdered him  I mean  you gotta think  he knew he was taking  a major chance  in that area  holy fuck  yeah  holy fuck  but again  nobody says anything  no not at all  but Dane Cook  oh did you hear  yeah of course you heard  Dane Cook made fun of  the shooting  Tosh did a rape joke  did you hear 
[01:18:00]  sure you did  of course  because it was all over  I just want to see  the same blogger  you fucking  cock sucking bloggers  yeah  this is what I want to see  you blogging about  this savagery  yeah  yeah let's see it  let's see it bloggers  Somalia  couldn't get enough  talking about Tosh  you couldn't get enough  talking about Tracy  you couldn't get enough  talking about  fucking Dane  now how about this  where a comic is  murdered for teasing  something  yeah  for just teasing  how many people  are hungry out there  anybody  yeah  yeah  we're starving  right  pretty hungry 
[01:18:30]  observational humor  is very different  in Somalia  yes  you ever notice  during a clitoral  circumcision  how about them  flies  how many  how many pirates  here tonight  yeah  we got  quite a few pirates  out here tonight  no real punchlines  no he's just  just delivering it away  observing like shit  that goes on there  ah poor guy  oh that's him huh  wow  he looks like Patrice  a little  yeah he does look  like a thinner Patrice  a little bit  Somali 
[01:19:00]  fuck Patrice  damn it  still haven't listened  to his voice  still  it's very difficult  I want to though  I know  it was fun  people send clips  to me all the time  like this is one of my  I just  I click on the link  I start listening  I go I can't  you can't either right  nah it's just that  I still haven't listened  to the CD  they put out  after the fact  I hear it's brilliant  I heard parts of it  people in the business  say it's brilliant  it's  he's just so fucking funny  but  Mr. P obviously  that whole thing  of  like the bummerness 
[01:19:30]  kind of outweighs  the funniness  too much  still so  not mentioned  at the Comedy Central  Comedy Awards  oh why  really  Patrice was not mentioned  this year  why  I don't know  it's  it's such an  egregious  and disgusting  miss  of course you did  elephant in the room  was for them  what the fuck's  wrong with them  what the fuck's  wrong with them  it's a disgusting  and egregious  absolute ignoring  yeah 
[01:20:00]  it's  what would be  the reasoning  there's no  my opinion  is just  you know  it's just  whatever man  they had the  Comedy Awards  they had them  yeah  Amy Schumer was there  and I guess  Rickles was there  and Chris Rock  presented something  and they don't  mention Patrice  they don't mention  Patrice  who did a special  this past year  for them  and was on  Tough Crowd  for two years  on them  and was on  shorties  watching shorties  with them  and with Patrice  it's a disgusting  and I don't care  why they're doing it 
[01:20:30]  I don't care  if it's because  they're planning  the fact that  you don't mention  this fucking  great  one of the  greats  that dies  suddenly  at your award  show  is inexcusable  don't forget  the Charles Sheen  roast  oh yeah  I forgot  Sheen  right  we forgot  about that  little show  and not a mention  of him  not a mention  not a montage  because just too  busy getting out  those awards  to put a montage  of this great comedian  they probably needed  more time for  Colbert  it's 
[01:21:00]  whatever it was  it was very funny  by the way  it's a humiliating  and embarrassing  miss by them  wow  an embarrassing  and humiliating  fucking  what's the word  I'm looking for  not a snub  a front  a snub  you gotta acknowledge  his passing  at the very least  how do you not  you got it  how did the comic  side even mention it  they were going  in a break  or something  maybe they did  maybe they  maybe they were  told not to  maybe they  did some editing  I don't know 
[01:21:30]  it's just  it's one of the  most fucking  despicable things  I've heard in a long time  was him not being mentioned  and not even a momentary  tribute being paid to him  uh oh  fucking dirtbags  white house for sale  inside the money war  but anyone could be  president in America  I was told that  as a kid  well  anyone that makes  billions of dollars  or can raise  billions of dollars  I was just thinking  how awful  it fucking is  to  that we have a president  that is just  campaigning all the time 
[01:22:00]  for the  the last couple of years  in the white house  like he's doing  something today  another big fundraiser  thing  he's just  trying to keep  the gig  yeah I don't think  that should be part  of the job  I think you should  not be allowed  to campaign  it's amazing  if you actually  have the job  you can't  how about you  got the job  let people  base their vote  on how well  you do the job  not trying to  sell people  on how good  you're going  to do  in the next  four years  maybe  and bashing  the other guy 
[01:22:30]  but in all fairness  all presidents  do it too  that's all I want  to add to the discussion  I'm not fucking  pointing  they all do  singling anyone out  maybe  maybe we give him  the last three months  leading up to an election  some period of time  but I mean  two years  to be allowed  to do it for two years  is crazy  he flew in  to New York  what two days ago  for a fundraiser  it's $40,000 a plate  yeah  and he came in  just to have the dinner  and then fly out  and going with your point  you think to yourself  what could he  have been doing  for the country 
[01:23:00]  with that period of time  no one  that block of time  no one  they don't work  none of these guys  do down there  they're all trying  to protect their asses  every single one of them  don't work  what Chick-fil-A  we were also talking  about Chick-fil-A  earlier  the gay  well  the gay  I think  most people  at this point  know that  we support  the gays  and that whole  issue  but we also 
[01:23:30]  support  people  being able  to  speak their  mind  and have  an honest  answer  on a tough  question  have an opinion  because now  people are demanding  that these  Chick-fil-A's  don't pop up  in these cities  because the guy's  not for gay marriage  we don't want  them here  I'm for gay marriage  but more importantly  I'm for a guy  being able to  answer a tough  question honestly  yeah  and then  what should happen  if everyone  just fucking  calmed the fuck  down  then if you're  gay  or you're 
[01:24:00]  for gay marriage  then it's your  choice if you want  to go to the  Chick-fil-A's  and if enough  people don't want  to they'll close  but to tell  the company  they don't have  a right to  start up their  business  because this is  how he feels  that's crazy  in America  and I don't  agree with  what the guy  said  well look at  the bears  they're doing  Ron Manuel  Menino  look where they  all stand  politically  right  the fucking  phony  left  Manuel is  such an  idiot  it's like  the nerve  that he would 
[01:24:30]  bring this up  when his  citizens are  being shot  on a daily  basis  and the  economy of  Chicago is  just a  fucking  disaster  and that's  what he  decides to  address  as he's  welcoming in  Louis Farrakhan  and the  Nation of  Islam to  help with  his fucking  crime  his gun  crime  problems  in Chicago  how about  you fucking  give the  law enforcement  a little  more of a  free reign  instead of  fucking  shitting on  them all  the time  and they  gotta make  guns illegal  in Chicago  they just 
[01:25:00]  gotta do that  oh wait  wait a minute  they gotta do  that  they are  oh that's  right  yeah  oh that's  right  we all  know that  god  but the  Chick-fil-A  thing  yeah  wow  you know  I mean  it's  it's very  simple  you don't  have to  agree with  what the  guy thinks  but you can't  shut down  his business  because he's  giving you  an honest  answer on  something  and what  do you  think  I fucking hate  he feels  that way  but you can't  shut a guy  you can't  shut businesses  down because  they think  that way  this is how  the whole  discussion 
[01:25:30]  in this country  should go  you know the guy  from Chick-fil-A  doesn't like  gay marriage  who gives a fuck  what he thinks  make me a sandwich  stupid  give me something  chickeny  give me one of them  fillets  is it going to affect  how he makes me  chicken sandwiches  no  then I don't care  and you're gonna get  the problem is  you're gonna get  people just not  speaking honestly  at all  well we're pretty  much at that  point  let's be honest  people are  petrified to  speak their  mind these  days  petrified  and for no  reason  it's not like  it's not spewing 
[01:26:00]  hate  it's an opinion  on something  if someone wants  to have an opinion  that they don't  believe gay  marriage is  truly marriage  based on the  definition of  marriage  that's their  prerogative  they could fucking  that's their right  they could believe  that  once you start  using it  to incite  hatred  or violence  towards someone  then there's a  big problem  of course  but if you just  have  that's my  opinion  then that's  fucking fine  it should be  fine 
[01:26:30]  and then let  the free  market decide  right  wow  everybody  let the free  market decide  boy no one  agrees with this  guy and they're  just not going  to Chick-fil-a  and Chick-fil-a  is out of business  there you go  right  or wow  I really support  what he's saying  and it thrives  right  but to demand  that they be  shut down  because this is  how the guy  thinks  country of  fucking  pussies  and fucking  but again  there's this  and they always  find a way  to do it  like this  Kathleen Quinn  who I don't 
[01:27:00]  like at all  on Long Island  wants the one  on NYU campus  not open  because  and their thing  is because  of their  discriminatory  views  see they always  make it look  like oh no  no no no  we're for free  speech  but it's the  discriminatory  oh  they never  just come out  with the  fucking truth  I didn't like it  you shouldn't  be able to say it  that's the  self-centered  shit that's  happening  that's it  that's what  they're saying  meanwhile  politicians  how come 
[01:27:30]  they're not  saying that  politicians  who vote  against gay  marriage  shouldn't be  allowed to be  politicians  right  why isn't  this cocksucker  Menino  or fucking  stupid  Rahm Emanuel  coming out  and saying  that  because by the  way Rahm Emanuel  Obama was  forced  into admitting  his position  on gay  marriage  so why don't  you come out  and say that  any democrat  who's against  gay marriage  is not fit  to serve  office  and should  be removed  should be removed  start with the  business you're in  yeah  there you go  it's the same 
[01:28:00]  exact thing  as some dumb  chicken place  I'm suspicious  I don't even know  if Obama's truly  for that shit  I know  I think he knows  it works in his  favor if he is  at this moment  he had to say  something  I don't know  I really don't  know  you think he's  for it  I think he is  wait why is  Rahm Emanuel  bringing Louis Farcon  he's against  gay marriage  why is he  associated with  the nation of  Islam  they're against  gay marriage  no sense  oh that's right  okay that's okay  gotcha  it's really  the hypocrisy  is amazing  and I know  we're crazy  I'll say that 
[01:28:30]  but are we  really crazy  that we're the  only ones  that talk like  this  why isn't  anyone on  these shows  and I know  we say it a lot  and I apologize  but it's worth  repeating a lot  why doesn't  anyone else  give this angle  on mainstream  news programs  in America  they don't want  to be fucking  persecuted  and fired  and you know  shunned  and get the  scarlet letter  of racism  or sexism  or homophobia  people are petrified  to talk in this 
[01:29:00]  day and age  honestly  because when you  do  this is what  happens  when you say  when you're  asked the question  hey how do you  feel about that  gay marriage thing  I'm not for it  I think a marriage  is between a man  and a woman  and say oh really  hey fuck you  you're not opening  your store here  wait what happened  how come you're  you know  how come you're  sanctioning against  me for an opinion  that you asked for  but we didn't like  what you said  I think  yeah I think  we're having a very  logical discussion  here and for some  reason you don't  hear it other places  I'm petrified  this is how we feel 
[01:29:30]  and it's another way  to look at this  but these people  are just scared  to bring it up  in this way  I love being able  to talk openly  about everything  whether it's here  twitter  fucking a conversation  I just love it  it's so freeing  to not give a fuck  right  like what people  think about you  or say  oh he's this  good  yeah  so  can you imagine  if they said to you  I'm for gay marriage  and they wanted to  not allow you  to open your business  it's like  this is what  this is why 
[01:30:00]  I always say  Americans are fraud  because we don't  like they are  at least defending  this right  because people  this is not even  about free speech  this is about  a lot of people  who just really  dislike gays so much  or showing support  for an anti-gay  but I appreciate  the fact that  people are backing  up this guy's right  but if he said  I'm for gay marriage  and then some  conservative politician  came out and said  we don't want  your store open  the outrage  and justifiable outrage  that would be disgusting  of course  of course  you're a bigot  you're this  you're that  yeah  of course  fuck  god it's fucking  irritating 
[01:30:30]  it's amazing  who cares what he thinks  I don't give a fuck  and then people say  well he donates money  to a lot of causes  that are anti-gay  okay if he's doing that  if you feel that he's  actively hurting your cause  then don't support his business  right  but you can't  you can't stop the guy  from opening business  you can't do that  it's not in America  well  this America's a little  different these days  it really is  we always say  not in America  but you think we always have  we always have  yeah we've always been  talking about that 
[01:31:00]  I think though  it's based so much  now on fear  on fear of  of what  what you're going to  be perceived as  and that  that you're going to  carry it around  like baggage  for the rest of your  career  your life  and people are  they're scared  to speak out  it's a legitimate fear  I mean  what happens to  people's careers  they fucking get fired  they're gone  they can't get rehired  all just based on an opinion  unless you're Chris Brown  and you punch a woman  in the face repeatedly 
[01:31:30]  then you're not only  allowed to sing at the Grammys  but you're allowed to sing  a couple of songs  and if you come out  against him  his dumb women fans  actually stick up  for the  for the fucking  abuser  and call you an asshole  that's kind of fun  it is fucking fun  that's one of the  more fun Twitter games  yes  I like that game  Team Breezy comes after you  watch out for Team Breezy  but Brett Ratner  said faggot  kind of joking  yeah  and was not  allowed to host the Oscars  or was asked  not to host them  Chris Brown 
[01:32:00]  repeatedly punches  his girlfriend  in the face  yeah  and again  I know it was a fight  between both of them  but then he's invited  to the grad  it's this  what drives me crazy  is the fraudulence  of selective outrage  it drives me nuts  selective outrage  yeah  that's what it is  that's a good term  ugh people  alright  I'm tired of it  phones are lit  maybe we'll get your  opinions about this  after the break  is it true in Florida  there's a few thousand  murderers they're  letting out on the street  I hope so  because there's not  enough resources  murderers being let out 
[01:32:30]  on the streets  we'll tell you why  Jerome of Florida  if you can stick  through the break  we'll go to you next  what the hell  I'm going to Chicago  today with Troy Kwan  alright  Black Sabbath  yes we are  no you're not  and I guess  there was a problem  with the rooms  we gotta share a room  what  I'm kidding  rock it bro  and we're seeing  Black Sabbath tomorrow  yes  240 something  sharing a room  today in Chicago  Troy's a 40 something  right  I think so  yeah  and I'm going in early  just because tomorrow  I have to pick up 
[01:33:00]  my credentials  and get  what  well just  you gotta  you know what I mean  otherwise you can't  get backstage  what  to interview the band  without credentials  I thought  no more pictures  no more talking  no more  yeah we heard that  yeah  but he didn't say  no more interviews  well that's true  okay  so yeah  I get to interview  Sabbath tomorrow  okay  I'm very very happy  no I'm laughing  because I just got  some info  on Troy's travel bag  why do we have  to see it 
[01:33:30]  oh no  just have him  bring it in  Troy's travel bag  needs to be seen  okay  Travis is suggesting  that we take a look  I haven't seen it  alright there's your  there's your tease  for the next segment  okay then rock em bro  Sirius XM  the Opie and Anthony show  I didn't hear it 
[01:34:00]  bunch of nines  you shit up  you said it was  got your trash  I wanna  I wanna  it's donut day  Edgar  oh right  that's why Roland's  late today I guess  he's getting donuts  for everybody  is he going to  donuts  he's getting the  flea market donuts  from the actual story  you know what I'm gonna  do to those donuts  I'm gonna look at them  I'm gonna put my ass  on them  and I'm gonna ruin them  oh nice  that would be disgusting 
[01:34:30]  hey look  go donuts  so we  we got donuts  on the way  supposedly they're  in root  and that guy  is discussing  Krispy Kreme  and their stupid  light  and I think  the light was  fake  and I think  Anthony thinks  the light was  also fake  but these idiots  are trying to  convince us  that the light  thing was  real  explain the light  thing for the  people that don't  know  real Krispy Kreme  stores  they make the  donuts in the 
[01:35:00]  stores  and so  they would  so it's Dunkin Donuts  so  Dunkin Donuts  no  Dunkin Donuts  like heat them  up or something  they don't actually  make them  they make them  in the back  there's a donut  guy  remember  no  Dunkin Donuts  doesn't make  the donuts  they just  heat them  so stop lying  Krispy Kreme  had like a  donut factory  looking thing  that you could  see through  the glass  and so  whenever they  would make  fresh donuts  a light  goes on  on the side  of the store  and that's  how you know  there's fresh  donuts  but we're 
[01:35:30]  saying they  just turn  the fucking  light on  when they  want business  number one  you could  taste the  difference  and number  two  you could  see them  being made  yeah  if you  owned a  Krispy Kreme  why would  you go  alright  well  we can't  have the  light on  until the  donuts are  fresh  that means  people aren't  going to go  into your  business  because they'll  still go in  what about  all the people  that are  passing by  and like  well  the light's  on  I don't  well  if the light  was on  I would  stop  exactly  because there  are more  people  who would  randomly  stop  I think  it's a scam  I think  you can  taste the  difference  Krispy Kreme  goes okay 
[01:36:00]  look this  light thing  it'll work  in our favor  as long as  we have  the light  on a lot  so basically  like two  in the morning  when they  know the  business is  low  guess what  light's not  on  five o'clock  in the afternoon  guess what  light is on  that doesn't  mean that  the donuts  are fresh  and no one's  checking up  on this  if you go in  with the  light on  and you get  a donut  and it's  not fresh  you're not  going back  to the store  even a donut  that's a day  it's only a  couple of  hours  then it's a  scam 
[01:36:30]  if I remember  correctly  didn't you also  get a free  donut if the  light was on  I think so  it happened  rarely  well you know  people would  yell when they  would see that  they would start  yelling fresh  donut alert  fresh donut  alert  no one ever  yelled that  terrible thing  to yell at  me  speaking of  terrible things  I had that  stupid nickel  song  all day  oh did you  really  I don't  remember  the nickel  song  I really  don't  remember  say hey 
[01:37:00]  what do  you say  give me  a nickel  say hey  what do  you say  give me  a nickel  you ever  just wake  up with  something  in your  head  what have  I ever  not  a cock  in my  head  like a  bullet wound  was fired  out of a  fucking  cock gun  stuck in  my temple  yeah  a lot of  other people  buying into  the light  thing  sorry  I'm not  buying into  it  well you  have to  go on  Krispy Kreme  I want  some old  Krispy Kreme  employers 
[01:37:30]  or employees  and they'll  let us in  on it  that light's  horse shit  most of the time  it was horse shit  you can see  them being made  and you can  taste  when a donut  is on the  conveyor belt  they put the  old donuts  on the  conveyor belt  and matter  of fact  I'll go  with this  because this  guy  Matt  goes  you get  a free  donut  with the  lighters  on  because  they're  making  them  no this  is what  they're doing  if they're  even doing  the light  thing  I bet  donuts  are getting  a little  old  so they're  like  you know  what  turn the  fucking  light on  we gotta  get rid  of some  stale  donuts  there's a  huge  difference  in taste  between a 
[01:38:00]  donut  that's  just been  made  that's  the  difference  between  going to  a  Krispy Kreme  store  and going  to  7-Eleven  and buying  Krispy Kreme  I could take  an old  donut  ready  I could  microwave  it for  10-15  seconds  you're  going to  go  holy  fuck  this  fresh  you're  buying  into  the  scam  a  microwave  donut  doesn't  taste  like  a  fresh  donut  you're  an  idiot  that's  like  microwaving  a piece  of bread  and saying  it tastes  like it's  baked  bread  it doesn't  you're  buying  in  to a 
[01:38:30]  scam  I've  presented  evidence  and you  have  not  people  all  come  you know  these  businesses  come up  with all  sorts  of ways  to try  to get  you  into  the  store  obviously  it hasn't  been  effective  because  they're  closing  stores  all the  time  narrowed  down  a  donut  to  exactly  the  time  of  day  yes  he takes  a bite  and he's  like  these  are  215  give me  two of  the 605  and I'll  have an  1110  Iraq 
[01:39:00]  a couple  things  can you  tell the  difference  between  just a  run  of the  mill  donut  and a  fresh  donut  probably  not  I don't  really  thank  you  you  have to  actually  choose  them  he just  throws  them  like a  pelican  eating  fish  sorry  how do  you get  that  incredibly  soft  body  if you're  not eating  anything  that's  bad  yeah  you never  say  I don't  eat  dessert  style  stuff  not a  hint  of a  muscle  but he  doesn't  eat 
[01:39:30]  any  dessert  it's  never  any  cakey  you don't  like  cake or  sweets  right  I don't  I eat  regular  food  and really  crappy  food  but I  don't  eat  like  dessert  style  why  you don't  like  cheesecake  I love  cheesecake  but I'm  not always  eating  cheesecake  how about  chocolate  cake  no I  don't like  chocolate  how do  you not  like  chocolate  so weird  chocolate  caramel  all that  nougat  I don't  eat  any  of that  caramel  rules  what about  an old  git  oh my  god  you're too  much  going to  break  we just  got back  we can't  do that 
[01:40:00]  trust me  I would  love to  but we  can't  do that  next time  we do  that  we're  going to  do it  holy shit  here's another  guy buying  into the  scam  you could  actually  watch  them  take  the  donuts  off  the  conveyor  belt  if I was  going  in the  business  I would  go  alright  here's  where  the  new  donuts  come  in  and  I 
[01:40:30]  with  you  you  can  tell  you  six  hours  maybe  not  a  day  but  six  hours  old  is  an  old  donut  those  crispy  cream  donuts  just melt  right in your  mouth  you know when  they're new  you 100% know when  they're brand new  there's no way  they spell  crispy cream  maybe you have 
[01:41:00]  no taste  there was another c word  you guys are saying you could tell the difference between  you could tell the difference between a donut that's a day old and made that day  without a doubt  a Krispy Kreme donut  I'll take that bet  and that's easy  we get a box of Krispy Kremes today and we get a box tomorrow and you're going to tell me the difference between the two boxes  no fucking way  a day old and fresh out of the oven  and we gotta work out the rules so you don't luck out and just  and you gotta tell me where you're gonna find fresh Krispy Kreme donuts in New York City  you have to do 
[01:41:30]  there's a Krispy Kreme  there's a brand new one on Broadway and 17th  I got hundreds  you made that out  I got hundreds of dollars I'm willing to spend on this  that's cool  I already took two of yours  I know you did  where are you gonna find fresh Krispy Kremes in Manhattan  that's up to you guys  that's the problem  the only New York stores  I got nothing to prove  in Penn Station  there used to be a lot but they closed down because of the stupid light thing  no they were too busy giving away all their donuts  wait does the bun in Penn Station make them fresh  I don't think so  I doubt it  exactly so fuck them  and this guy's saying  this woman actually 
[01:42:00]  the light just means you get a hot donut  yeah  that doesn't mean it's fresh  that's a sexual term  they could be heating it up a little bit  it's hot now  yeah  because hot now  see that proves our point right there  they can't  they can't commit and say they're fresh  because they know they're not fresh  but they put hot  hot now yeah  people are gonna think hot means fresh  if you gave somebody a free stale donut  why would they buy a dozen  because it's not stale yet  a stale donut's a few days old  no a stale donut is a huge difference  between a six hour old 
[01:42:30]  a day old  I'm gonna be stubborn on this one man  big time  well you should go to a Krispy Kreme  I'm gonna be stubborn  and find out  I guarantee you guys can't figure it out  I used to run a donut store  and if you spent ten thousand dollars  we gave you two free donut holes  just allow Edgar  how'd that business go?  not good  Roland will figure out the donut fucking bet  he'll find a place where we can get fresh donuts  two days in a row  one will sit for a day 
[01:43:00]  the other one will be brand new fresh  and I guarantee  out of three donuts  you can't guess two  wow  because you're gonna luck out on one problem  the bakery in Scarsdale  you could tell the difference  will you stop with those shitty  almost upstate New York  eateries  I know  you're fucking  in the sticks up there  those north of Yonkers dumps  that you love so much  they make them fresh  and Timmy makes a good point  almost upstate  because a lot of people  could appreciate some upstate shit  but you gotta go a little further for that  not almost upstate 
[01:43:30]  and we put them in a bag  if you eat them right then  they taste one way  if you eat them in the evening  or the next day  they taste like they've been sitting all day  I'm not listening to you Sam  that's why you're wrong  stinky bus driver in Nebraska  is gonna help me out  stinky bus driver  go ahead  he's a stinky bus driver  hey morning gentlemen  how y'all doing  alright  shit I grew up in the south  and you know  we were kids  there was a Krispy Kreme down the road  and you know  they got the light  and all that stuff  and whatever  but we'd jump in the dumpster  and pull the boxes out 
[01:44:00]  that are a day old  and they're still freaking fabulous  hell we'd eat them  to her out of our minds  dumpster diver  he didn't say they were the same  he said they were still good  he wasn't a dumpster diver  they were still in the boxes  no one's saying day old donuts  aren't good  no one says donuts suck the next day  he didn't make your point at all  that wasn't the point he made  take my bet  he just said his trash donuts  were edible  yeah of course they're edible  they're still good  they have frosting on them  take my bet  we'll bet TVs again  but you're going to have to  bring in your brand new TV  nah I'll find it  nah you should be confident  yeah so you don't have 
[01:44:30]  the confidence  well because  I'm not a millionaire  who can afford TV  that's why you are confident  class warfare  class warfare  after a bet  you're going to have two TVs  but if you're so confident  that you can do this  then the money thing  wouldn't matter  because it would be  free money for you  I have to be a lot more confident  than you do  no you don't  I took stupid bets  when I had no money  then why did I take the bets  then  it's going to be a stupid bet  on your part  to make some money  right  thank you Anthony  got to take a little risk  first you have to tell me  where the donuts are coming from  and all this 
[01:45:00]  I'm not going to take a bet  that I don't know the rules of  why don't we make them  why don't we buy a donut making oven  see if we get serious  to spring for that  in our new studio  we want a donut making oven  alright this guy worked through  his college job  his crispy cream  excuse me  probably at a college  crispy cream  or a real crispy cream  honestly I don't even know  if he's a pro or against  alright  I'm just taking his call  look you can see for yourself  I have no idea  alright  what's up Mark  what can you tell us  on this discussion here  or whatever  actually I work part time  my way through college 
[01:45:30]  at a crispy cream  breggers  yeah  right  but the thing is  with the crispy cream  is  they make donuts  to sell  for  organizations  for fundraisers  but they also sell them  at stores  and what they would do  when they would make  those donuts  that's when they would  put on the hot  fresh now sign  you would get  the donut  the donut  literally is fresh  there's no microwaves  it comes straight  from the fryer 
[01:46:00]  now this stuff  is incredibly  bad for you  it's just  fat  but it's incredibly  fresh  and it's good  it melts in your mouth  this guy's calling  hi my name is  Carl Crispy  we're believing him  look I'm  suspicious of their  business practices  but  yes  but the best still  remains that you  guys cannot tell the  difference between  a fresh donut  and a donut  that's one lousy  day old  we should take a  round trip  I bet a lot  of money 
[01:46:30]  on this one  I mean  I hate to say it  but you sound  more like Fezzy  today than  Opie  oh man  I don't know  Mr. Half-Hawked  and going full steam  and not knowing  the whole story  but I'm willing  to put my money  where my mouth is  you do  to the college point  Fezzy just babbles  about nothing  to the college point  how many hot  fresh donuts  have you had  from Krispy Kreme  oops  why the pride  dude  why the pride  you used to work 
[01:47:00]  there in college  what is your name  Michael Kreme  there he is  Michael Kreme  of the famous  Kreme family  yes  of the Kremes  this is Captain Hook's  fish and chips  what's that  you should go to  Krispy Kreme  in Syracuse  are you taking the  bet or not  of course you did  why wouldn't you  upstate  almost upstate  Syracuse  Syracuse  is technically  central New York  if it's between  Toronto and Manhattan  Sam loves a  bakery  enough ready 
[01:47:30]  if you can see  fucking mountains  you're happy  yeah  I like upstairs  you can see mountains  from Westchester  oh you can too  it's a suburb  it's 20 minutes away  oh I love Chatham  Yonkers is Westchester  what  there's some mountains  up there  DMX is from  is it a borough  no  sorry  it's next to the boroughs  BAP  sorry  New Jersey  it's some awful place  best pizza  that's in Yonkers  yeah  is it  it's at Lucas's  and Yonkers  it wouldn't be in 
[01:48:00]  fucking New York City  it's modern  the city proper  this  this next guy says  Sam's right about the light  but 20 minutes after the light  goes off  they suck  a donut sucks  20 minutes  20 minutes later  you guys are crazy  that's different  they don't suck  but there is a difference  yeah  absolutely  so maybe they go back  to the donuts  that are real old  and that's why the bet  is risky  because  you're never going to  give me fresh  out of the oven  donuts in the studio  because they would have  had to get to the studio  at Krispy Kreme  they come out of the oven  have you eaten them  fresh out of the oven  yeah  how are they 
[01:48:30]  amazing  what kind did you have  I don't care  they're not amazing  donuts are just  fair enough  Krispy Kreme remote  donuts are always just amazing  if we can get to a Krispy Kreme  I will take the bet  from Krispy Kreme  people will be riveted  to the radios  oh would that be great  will Sam enjoy his donut  or won't he  we'll find out  after we all hang ourselves  it's terrible  this idiot's trying to say  the quality drastically drops  it does  you have no idea  what you're talking about  that's dumb  you don't know  what you're talking about  it's like any other food  like if you have pizza  sitting out for an hour  it doesn't taste the same way 
[01:49:00]  it does  I'll eat the oven  yeah but you can tell  it's not  the oven  Iraq knows pizza  Iraq knows pizza  he does know  old pizza is good  of course  cold pizza  I'm not debating good  love cold pizza  does it taste the same as hot  yes  no  you're out of your mind  no  you're just making  I don't say no  but my bet is  you heat up both  you sound like a fool  you're saying microwave pizza  tastes the same as pizza  out of a pizza oven  no  you're saying we're going to  heat up both kinds of donuts  pretty close  you sound like a fool  pretty close  when you get pizza  from the place  and you open that box up 
[01:49:30]  and start eating it  it's totally  there's no other time  pizza tastes like that  no matter what you do to it  it's like anything that comes  out of an oven  what do you mean  now you're on his donut side  yeah I'm sold  Anthony guy  you're really  I'm done yeah  fresh out of the oven  pizza is a very unique flavor  he won me over  that means you just want  to move on  I get it  yeah  thanks for bringing our pizza  when you pick that up  it just drips in the hot  like oh god  my pizza is so fresh  exactly  everyone starts doing  the fresh pizza toast  you ever do that  where you take your fresh pizza  cheers  and you mash your slices together 
[01:50:00]  and you mush them like that  to all the cheeses in a pile  and then you slap each other  with the fucking red dough  no  the fresh pizza toast  Sam what do you have to say  to Eric who says  I have an erection  and he's a soldier  so these guys don't fucking lie  I don't know why  why do you have an erection  I don't know  I love talking about pizza  oh you got a boner  no it's no big deal  what time are the donuts  gonna get here  oh that's an erection  I don't know  but why do you have to  show everyone  he's fucking  got his sweatpants on 
[01:50:30]  he almost fell out of your chair  right there  you're the old front heavy  with your rod  why  I don't know  say Alice  once in a while  it bleeds in  and the next day  it bleeds in  here's a soldier  they don't lie  go ahead Eric  in Indiana  help me out  it's the only reason  I'm taking your call  I'll be honest  that's our price  yeah they bring us  about wheat gold donuts  to Camp Atterbury  for our unit  and we just throw them  in our microwave  and you can never tell  the difference  there you go  what do they call  what you wait for me  Camp what  it's not a point for you 
[01:51:00]  Camp Atterbury  in Indiana  point for me  Camp Atterbury  how do you camp at a berry  why don't you  eat them  yeah  I mean I think  I'm not sure about  like Sam  look  I was talking pizza  not donuts  you've never had  a fresh donut  because of the pizza  no  he sold me  on the pizza thing  thus thinking  that donuts  might be the same  but I'm not sure  if a microwave donut  reacts as poorly  as microwave pizza does 
[01:51:30]  have you ever  microwaved a donut  never  but I have  microwave pizza  the glaze  like drips off of it  sounds delicious  no no no  like it's off now  and it's all sticky  and shit  it's awful  I got a secret way  to reheat the donuts  what is it  I'm not saying  you know you don't  have a towel on top  stick in your ass cheeks  and jog in friction  heats it up  gives it a great taste  that's right  you fill your underpants  with donuts  and you run for a while  around Central Park  I think I went to a sauna  cinnamon copper donut  how awful would that be  yeah 
[01:52:00]  there's a bunch of  fucking leg  there's side leg hairs  like you know those  long side pubes  you get  around the side  of your thigh  decide if it wants  to be a leg hair  or a pube  yeah  it's like crystal gale hairs  in your fucking donut  smells like onions  can I have an onion hair donut  please  toss up  I did some grooming recently  skin tag on it  some grooming  yeah  shave it off  no I don't want to  shave it all off  I would look silly  shaved off  you're a hairless  little boy  yes I am  you can do that 
[01:52:30]  I have to keep it tame  but still  recognition of  that I am a man  with my  fucking cock  I have to have  a little fucking  little hat over him  a little hair hat  nothing  well that's you  I'll put the clipper on  I'll put the little  fucking attachment on it  yeah  meh meh meh  I shaved mine once  for real  all the way down  and  and then it just  starts growing in  and it hurts  cause like a fucking  like you got a porcupine  in your pants 
[01:53:00]  it just looked lonely  it just looked lonely  it just looked like  it was in the middle  of a  I don't know  a beach by itself  yeah so it's like  out in the open  no shelter  like a cactus plant  just lonely  in the middle  of fucking nothing  I felt like it  needed protection  yeah yeah  no protection  it was just out there  you want to help  with that  with that innocence  like the wolf  huffed and puffed  and blew your pubes away  right  yeah you get a mouth on it  all of a sudden  it doesn't look so lonely  point circuit point  remember we were talking  about venting machines 
[01:53:30]  yesterday  there's two venting machine  things really fast  someone sent me a picture  and hopefully Sam  could find it  cause I was lazy  and I didn't favorite  this tweet  but a guy sent me  a picture of a  venting machine  where they had a  and I gotta know  if this is real  a tuna fish kit  yeah  it's in the back office  what is it  yeah we have them here  what's a tuna fish  what the fuck is that  when the fuck  have I been living  that I haven't run  into the tuna fish kit  it's a can of tuna fish  but why are they  calling it a kit  it's called a can of tuna fish  it's got crackers with it 
[01:54:00]  yeah it's got crackers  call it cracker  so you spread the tuna fish  on the crackers  that's all it is  well we had it in our  old vending machine  I don't know if it's in  the new one that we got  two weeks ago for no reason  that's gotta be fresh  why do we got a new one  for no reason  I don't know  why do we have new  coffee machines every  oh there it is  tuna salad kit  it comes with mayo  so it's just a can of tuna  how do you open up the lid  probably got a pop top  oh just a pop top  tuna fish can  how do you drain the water  probably in a sink  you drink it  what if you're not around  it's delicious  it's just  it's lousy tuna fish  in a fucking vending machine 
[01:54:30]  that's great  they're just fancying up  by calling it a kit  but they got crackers  and mayo  yeah  you want one  they might have one  you know what  it kind of sounds good  it's a nice  tuna on crackers  it's delicious  not out of a vending machine  dude  I fold it quickly  on this one  it kind of looks good  just a can of tuna  give you a little salt  and pepper  just a little bit  no  no you probably  have to get that yourself  and then the other thing  that we never brought  to the show  because we got really busy  there's a new vending machine  that MSNBC was talking about  a few weeks back  a mashed potato 
[01:55:00]  vending machine  and gravy  oh my god  does that sound good  it just spits out  it works like the old  coffee machines  we were talking about  where you put a container  underneath  their little spout  people saying yum or yuck  potatoes come flying out of it  potato flakes  and then  and then your fucking gravy  comes on top of it  and it looks delicious  and you just  I would do that in a second  in a vending machine though  I would  it's just  I never liked any of those things  that don't come in some  closed thing  like  even the soda 
[01:55:30]  years ago  when I was a kid  they had the one  where the cup drops down  and then the syrup  and the seltzer  to make the soda  yeah  oh my god  how old are you  you're lying about your age  I swear  we're supposed to be  around the same age  you remember those  I swear to god  you come up with stuff  I'm like wow  the cup would drop down  and it would make the soda  because they'd have a bunch  of different flavors  in there  I swear to you  I don't remember this one  so they had different syrups  in the machine  but the seltzer  was just one thing  so whatever flavor 
[01:56:00]  you chose  that's the syrup  you got  Anthony I'm telling you  I don't remember that one  well child of the 80s  you remember that  I remember that  that's right  you don't remember  the cup coming down  I remember the cup  coming down  for all the shit  but not  it actually making  the soda  I don't  I don't know  you can't find  the mashed potato  I'd always have  an anxiety attack  that it was going  to overflow  like we go up to the top  and it's like  ah it's still coming out  and then it was stopping  were you amazed  were you amazed  how they figured  that shit out  right to the tippy top  fucking amazing  fucking amazing 
[01:56:30]  wow that's pretty cool  no it wasn't back  when they called it  sarsaparilla  Jesus  sarsaparilla  sometimes I make believe  I don't remember  some of the stuff  you talk about  but this one  I really don't remember  I  I really don't remember  I thought like  anybody kind of  would remember that  but  I'm sure we could get people  I do recall  a lot of things though  I do remember  a lot of things  no I'm  I'm sure it was  a real thing  I just don't remember it  like I just saw  the bumblebee thing  look at this 
[01:57:00]  oh there it is  oh  a little water down there  for that two bucks  shut up and shove  your face under there  a bowl of mashed potatoes  in a hurry  push button number three  for chicken gravy  at no extra charge  that looks like diarrhea  after a couple of minutes  it solidifies  did she say chicken gravy  no  no  no  let me say something  there are so many things  that are going to come  in fancy vending machines  like that  because of new manufacturing  of power  trust me 
[01:57:30]  in the next few years  you have all kinds of  where's his neck  I think his torso  is just superimposed  on this man  how do they keep  a machine like that clean  they don't  it's in Singapore  what do you  oh  oh is that where it is  yeah  oh  have you seen  the pizza vending machines  yeah  I've heard about them  yeah  I've heard about the pizza  how do they do that  why is it so loud  I'm waiting for  mama mia  look at this  let's pizza  is the only machine  in the world  capable of making  healthy and gently 
[01:58:00]  pizzas  using entirely  fresh ingredients  once you have chosen  your desired pizza  among the choice  available  the pizza is needed  rolled out  topped  cooked and served  starting with the water  and flour  in less than three minutes  let's pizza  offers a choice  among four different  types of flavours  that can be chosen  each time  from a wide menu  with an overall  autonomy of 90 pizzas  and I like the pizza  wow  the system of payment  accepts coins  and banknotes 
[01:58:30]  banknotes  provides change  and is compatible  with other payment systems  such as  vending keys  what the hell's  a vending key  we don't have vending keys  yeah  vending key  or other means  it's like a  fucking bum drive  what's it  eat her ass  fuck the pizza  choose from the  four flavours  of my eyes  they're sweaty  clean  needs to be shaved  they just made a doody  yes  the resulting do 
[01:59:00]  untouched by human hands  please come  press and rolled out  to create a 27 centimeter  diameter  centimeters  how big is that  that could be  fucking the size of a quarter  or a truck tire  I have no idea  I have no idea  look at the sauce  spins around  they gotta figure it out  I gotta tell you  this thing has to break  every fucking  two pizzas  you think  yes  you think there's a  out of water sign  on it  absolutely  preheating  and the topping  process begins  first the tomato 
[01:59:30]  is added  tomato  tomato  I like to fucking  dig on music playing  yeah  it's cooking  you get to watch it  in two minutes  the pizza  the pizza  is already  in the oven  and then the way  they give it to you  is you put your face  by it  and it smashes  scrawly pizza  onto your neck  I love that  a hand comes out  and just mushes  it on your neck  all I'm thinking is  imagine being  fifth online 
[02:00:00]  at this vending machine  oh man  it takes forever  hurry up over there  yeah  it puts in a little  box for you  that really looks  bad  yes  exactly  see all that  it's all fake  the pizza  is already made  they make it look  like they're making  the pizza  and then they  open that door  here's your pizza  that was made 
[02:00:30]  a long time ago  I like how they're  saying that  it's not touched  by human hands  people have rats  are probably running  around in that thing  shitting all over it  a rat shit pizza flavor  you can have  a tomato cheese  rat feces  and fly semen  if you'd like  lava duty  that's extra  we've got  bug hairs  bug eyes  and bug footprints  let's pizza  the healthy pizza  let's pizza  let's pizza  be great if she did that  and she just had a stroke  and died  she's killed her 
[02:01:00]  let's pizza  there's cupcake vending machines  now too  you see those  fresh  fresh  they cook them right in there  takes a while  to bake a cupcake  I know there's one  coming in New York  I bet you they're all  thrown in there  like gumballs  and then when you press  the button  one just rolls out  and lands on the floor  it's all sticky  cupcake craze  sprinkles  cupcake vending machine  coming to Georgetown  wow  that's pretty cool  it's a touch screen  little like a fucking  ATM  the new soda machines  are sick  they're amazing  those coke ones  yeah they got them  in like Dwayne Reed 
[02:01:30]  here in time  because you can get  like 200 different  kinds of soda  yeah  like you click  Mr. Pibb  it's all touch screen  and it's got every  coke variety  and then you click  like Mr. Pibb  but how do they  fit that much  because they  I've seen it  on a documentary  on CNBC  they have like  they look like  ink cartridges  yeah  these little flavor  things  and they're super  concentrated  and so you just  pop them in  like ink cartridges  they just have  like a lime  cartridge  so now you can  get coke lime  you know  and what does it  come out in  and then  a cup 
[02:02:00]  that you buy  a cup  right  no no no  you have the cup  I'm talking the same  thing  you have the cup  look it's a modern  take on what I said  who carries a cup  it's an athletic supporter  you buy the cup  you take it out of  your fucking pants  yeah really  we got it Jim  what if you just  walk up with a cup  well then yeah  you can get some soda  for free  technology is not  how to take the soda  out of the machine  that technology  has been there  it's a fountain drink  it'd be cool to  go up to the machine  with your own cup  yeah you could have  done that 30 years ago  it's a fountain drink  you're not breaking 
[02:02:30]  any ground  I thought that was  the important part  of the story  I don't want to  bring my own cup  the important part  is 90 as opposed  to 4 types of soda  so where do you  get the cup  that's going to  go away soon too  because  cups  bringing your own  cups  are you saying  that bowl of soda  is catching on  because I'm pushing  bowl of soda  let's buy  a bowl of soda  let's buy  stock in the  bowl of soda  cup  with a spoon  yeah  it's a really  big salad bowl 
[02:03:00]  with a smidge  of soda  at the bottom  and you drink  it mightily  like you're Caesar  what is Disney  doing  to eliminate  stealing  Disney's installing  RFID cards  in the  Ron and Fez  yes  in the soda machines  and then your cups  have them as well  so they know  if you purchase  that cup  that's tracking  you man  that's what you want  retina scanners  on your soda machines  how about we use  that for the terrorists  don't worry about  the soda  so you know  no more free soda  yeah  wow

[02:20:00]  I'm going to  change it  for an hour  well I have  a recording device  for the Sabbath  interview  I have two  backups  and then I'll  be taking a  video camera  to video  how many  mics  we bring  Mike  as soon as  we're talking  to Geezer  Ozzy  and Tony  yeah  I'm going to  try to have  all four  separately  have their  own mics  well I don't  know if  Rob will be  there but  I mean  how are you  going to  do that  there's a  machine  we have  an Adderall  machine  here  Adderall  Adderall  Adderall  and Adderall  and you can  record each  mic separately  so  so guys 
[02:20:30]  how is it  playing  you know  that's good  man  you're in  Chicago  who else  is on the  bill  they're doing  midget punching  and I have  no idea what's  happening before  Sabbath goes on  what about  you don't care  Jack White's  there  Black Keys  you gotta see 
[02:21:00]  Jack White  you know  let them have  fun  you wouldn't  go see  Jack White  and the  Black Keys  Chili Peppers  you're not  going to see  half these  I'm not going  to see anybody  but Sabbath  the Black Keys  are really good  and Jack White  you gotta see  good for Jack  the drive-ins  reunited  they're playing  oh my good god  thank goodness  you don't care  about any of these  what day is this  Afghan Whigs  it split up  for a couple days  exactly  I care about  one thing  oh boy  as the writing 
[02:21:30]  gets smaller  I guess the band  isn't as important  yeah  who's the biggest  fan of the band  red hot chili peppers  red hot cheapy pepper  the black Sabbath  is listed after  red hot chili peppers  the black keys  black Sabbath  Jack White  you gotta see  all of those  it's alphabetical order  what  Florence and the Machine  any Florence and the Machine fans  yeah they're cool  what  had to drive in  yeah  and then forget it  Avicii  Justice  Cascade  Cascade's cool  what about the shins 
[02:22:00]  Calvin Harris  Mike Snow  M83  what about Frank Ocean  Twin Shadow  oh I remember now  why I fucking  hate Lollapalooza  why  I don't like  any of these bands  Jack White  I don't hate Jack White  I don't give a fuck  about him  oh cool  I wanna go see  Sharon Von Etten  well why not  exactly  how about Blind Pilot  oh man I can see  Starslinger  this is why I fucking  hate Lollapalooza  and like Ozfest  yes  wow what's Ozfest  exactly  is it different than this 
[02:22:30]  what about fucking  wax  you're not gonna hang out  for wax  come on  gaslighting  first aid kit  they're good  followed up a little Mona  there's a bunch of  could be  right  what  you're just not into  a lot of that style  exactly  alternative rock  Lollapalooza can fucking  kiss my sweaty bag  if you don't fucking  watch Doomtree  you're an idiot  yeah why wouldn't  you watch Doomtree  that's what I say  if the Chili Peppers  were standing on this  fucking console performing  I'd go outside and shout  oh my god  come on  what's wrong with you 
[02:23:00]  give it away  give it away  give it away  now no  most motherfuckers  don't go downstairs  or terrible  it's odd that  Sabbath is playing  this though  no no  it's always  I will ask them why  because Ozfest came in  because Lollapalooza  wouldn't give Ozzy  his due  right  they wouldn't put him on  what  but it's just a  it's just a weird  I detest Lollapalooza  you're gonna see  Little Dragon though  right  there's a lot of  good bands on there  what  no  unless I'm walking  on my knees  my cock  on the floor  you know who loves 
[02:23:30]  Little Dragon  Little Dragon  I get it  yes  you know who loves him  who  Sal  really  Sal  Sal  you hate Sal right  Sal's kind of a dick  he is right  yeah  and I didn't even think so  until like I heard him  on the after show  a few times  he's incapable  of defending himself  and he just  because he's hired now  he seems to think  he's better  than other people  that might not be hired 
[02:24:00]  but the truth of the matter  is  the proof of the pudding  is in the work  and some of these interns  I see  are more go-getters  than Sal  oh  wow  I'm controversial  like the Chick-fil-A guy  you heard that  take my bags  that's me  wow  that's all I'm saying  probably right  but  just an opinion  what  ouch  Sal  what was that all about  yeah  watch him not defend himself 
[02:24:30]  just my opinion  why don't you defend yourself better  well no  I think  I think I do good work  Mark Zito  why would you allow that  well this is coming from somebody  that doesn't even know  what you do  so  how much credence  can you put in  what I say  no  I have no idea  I respect your opinion  I mean you said it  I wouldn't  no one else does  I do  thank you  put that donut  back  donuts  are for closers  you think I'm  fucking with you  I am not  fucking with you 
[02:25:00]  that's fucking great  yeah  I don't have to sit here  and listen to this  put that donut  back  so Sal  what are you saying  that Anthony's basically  saying that  interns are more  go-getters  well yeah  I don't  I don't agree with that  I think you seem  to have  found your  comfortable little niche  on a day-to-day basis  and you're happy  to be there  no need to really  go above and beyond  anymore  you're saying  you're sloughing off 
[02:25:30]  Ant  well not sloughing off  he's doing just enough  mediocre  I know  why the attitude  since you've been hired  I don't  I don't think I have  an attitude  since I've been hired  now they're both  pieces of garbage  we all see it  why not just take on  the whole room  Jesus  you certainly see  the attitude  no I don't  want to fight  with you guys  I think I do  good work  you don't even  want to fight  with Zito  what's wrong  with you  Zito fucking  ripped Zito  Zito really  ripped you apart  I heard you got  a beating  I didn't hear  the argument  Zito tore you up  Zito was doing 
[02:26:00]  fucking research  on me about  like my old band  and all  and he knew  about the  fucking panda  thing  Roland was probably  pumping him up  that was pretty good  you know what  he was prepared  for battle  I got a little  insight on this  fucking I ran  to Ronnie  outside the building  and he's like  ho ho  Zito kick  your boy's ass  and I had to  sit there like  yep  and I had to  just take it  wow  well I'm sorry  he goes  it's like when  my dad watched  that fucking  guy pin me down  and fucking  you know  start punching me 
[02:26:30]  fuck my mouth  look I don't know  Jesus Christ  that's all I gotta  say to you  don't get all  pissy eyed on me  I'm gonna start  crying  you're not a  fighting man  not really  no  but you started  you have no problem  I just started  verbally abused  because like I  said I had my  opinions about him  Zito finished it  he fucking  finished you  why'd you start  with Zito  because he's a  fucking  like I said  before  he's a wiener  I still think  he's a wiener  we call him a wiener  everyone  why a wiener  because he's just  he's just 
[02:27:00]  fuck I'm embarrassed  he's a wiener  I pray I don't  run into Ronnie again  oh  gonna be bad  right  nerds  Zito  you know how bad  it is when you  have to just go to  the person  yep  that's what I had to  say to Ronnie  yep  let me take  nothing  let me take  Zito down a couple  of notches though  too  I'll be completely  honest with you  I had no fucking  idea who he was  when I was in  the bar  he walked in  he walked up to me  he started talking  I noticed a SiriusXM 
[02:27:30]  hat  right  but I couldn't  even tell you  who the fuck  he was  until I started  going through  Twitter  after he tweeted  and I'm like  oh  oh it must be  Zito  but I said  the same thing  I went  to see  Spider-Man  I sat right  next to the kid  I didn't know  who he was  yeah  I swear to God  people think it's a bit  I don't know  who this fucking guy is  I have no idea  who he was  and if he walked in  right now  I wouldn't know  again  you know how  I got to know  Zito  I have to  what I do like  about him is  he was trying  to help us  when we were  trying to get  Roll in the  Springsteen picture  Zito was very  instrumental in 
[02:28:00]  we couldn't do it  but he did  really try  he didn't get  the picture  in the end  so fuck Zito  no but Zito  gave it an honest effort  fuck him  alright  do you think  he wore the  SiriusXM hat  hoping that you  would put  two and two together  absolutely  if somebody  comes up to me  with a SiriusXM hat  I'm going to be  thinking  that they might  work there  or I don't know  something different  than just some guy  walking up  and start talking  to me  you know  because I think  he even knew  I probably didn't  know who the fuck  he was  you already tore  Zito down  way worse than Sal 
[02:28:30]  when Zito was  cursing him out  to his face  why  just because we  don't know  who he is  well also  because Ant  said that  when we were  hanging out  at the bar  I had no idea  who he was  I had no idea  until I read  his clip  why  he was talking  about how forgettable  he was  some fucking  annoying guy  at the bar  with a hot girl  why are we supposed  to know who he is  I mean he worked  for the channel  for  doing what  I don't even know  Ron Fess's producer  I swear I don't know  that  I swear  he did it for  over a year  maybe two 
[02:29:00]  I knew that  but I never saw him  I didn't know  what he looked like  what does he do now  he took a different  position  he says  that's his  what does he actually do  he doesn't work  for the channel anymore  has no bosses  that could tell him  he needs to help  fucking Sal  he works for some  of the fine folks  up the hall  now you could do  that two man job  by yourself  motherfucker  that's what he told you  sounds like he's  perfect for those  assholes  that's right  he is  alright  good luck to him  I don't even know  who he is  but the question  remains  yeah  you know 
[02:29:30]  he may not work here  but at least he's  perfect for those  assholes  who is Sal  perfect for  I'm not really sure  yet  Sal's changed  since we hired him  it's a problem  it's a real problem  I see him take over  the board  when Iraq's got to  take one of his  giant shits  I see that's when  Sal takes over the board  and then after that  are you saying  Iraq loves doing  the mid-show  giant shit  oh does he love  he has timed it  so that every day  he can leave his post  and go take that  giant Iraq shit 
[02:30:00]  Iraq how many hours  a nice meat shit  yeah  how long can you last  before you have to  take your giant shit  of the day  well I haven't taken it yet  but you're  are you percolating  no I'm good right now  oh god  I bet you they fall out  like a giant pot  it sounds like a pot roast  being dropped out of a helicopter  you just picture the toilet  sighing when he picks the one  yeah  like oh god  that's why I was like  oh this guy  yeah there's a silent  like a cheer 
[02:30:30]  from the other toilets  no matter what's going on  in them  they're just happy  it's not him  why is Mark Zito calling  or does he just walk around  like a fucking horse  his asshole starts  unpuckering  shit just falls out  he can't help it  yeah  that's why he has  one of the houses  a big yard  he can walk around him  and make dookie  on the fucking  drop big dookies  as he's walking  he's falling on the heels  of his sneakers  yeah  he's a fucking horse bag  tied around the back  of his legs  Mark Zito  what's up  hey 
[02:31:00]  no  somebody just called me  and said  I was fucking shit  and I just wanted to see  what was going on  I'm at the doctor  right now  I didn't say anything new  oh what's wrong  A-Z-T  what do you need  what are you getting  why are you at the doctor  you did not  oh shit  see how easy that was  why are you at the doctor  Mark Zito  I'm at the doctor  because  my ankle's all fucked up  I don't know  I'm stuck in dick  I'm stuck in dick  tell him to shoot you up  with a few cc's  of personality 
[02:31:30]  why are you talking  Mark Zito  I don't know  because he's on the phone  what was thou saying  Mark Zito  hold on  hold on  hold on a second  this is the  Opie and Anthony show  this is Opie here  this is Anthony  oh he's introducing you  introducing you  yes  you know something Mark  how long  did it take you  to figure out  I didn't know  who the fuck you were  until I read  that you had tweeted  um  couple minutes  like about  through then  I honestly  when you first  walked up to me 
[02:32:00]  in the bar there  I really didn't know  who you were  why are you so  forgettable  yeah  you're a forgettable guy  that's what I said  because I really  don't know who you are  and everyone laughs  when I say this  I don't know  you didn't say it  with enough hate  it didn't stick  I don't know  I can't help it  what can I do  why don't you  stick out better  true hatred  is the glue  of insults  but I don't even  hate the kids  I don't even know  I really don't know you  why is that  Roland just threw  stuff at Sal  I don't blame him 
[02:32:30]  Sal's enraging  I'm sorry  Sal's really changed  since we hired him  yeah  that was a mistake  remember when he was  it's like when you're  I'll just edit  and it's all the other  mistakes I've made  you could be really good  in high school  but then when you go  to college  you're not good  like you're the best  senior in high school  and you're the worst  freshman in college  you were a good intern  no he was a good  high school athlete  but he can't even  play division  you know what he is  it's those players 
[02:33:00]  that are good enough  to play in the minor leagues  they call them 4A players  because they're  they're better than  triple A players  just short of  so why are they  in the majors  because they're just  not good  ah  you're nuts  Zito  4A  you called our show  that meant that  you had enough confidence  to help the show  so fucking  what do you got  I heard Sal  call me a fucking wiener  apparently he thinks  his job is to talk shit  about me  as opposed to do  actual work  oh  no work Sal  4A 
[02:33:30]  I'm gonna watch this  go down  what do you got  Sal  I do plenty of  fucking work around here  absolutely  and the other day  he was saying that  he was going to be  helping out  doing my job  for the Cleveland  sorry Chicago show  and that's clear  4A  Sam keeps putting  4A up to him  so he was making it  seem like he was  the one who was  fucking saving the show  by him  you know  by him coming  and helping me  out doing my job  well it's a two man job  I wasn't saving the show  I wasn't saving the show 
[02:34:00]  I was saving you  oh  and he didn't even have to  why would you just  take this  I'm amazed by this  he just  what is it  you can't hit the curveball  maybe  he can't hit the curveball  Sal doesn't have that  blood lust  maybe I just gotta get  more angry about it  I don't know  the show hasn't  done that to you yet  the anger and fucking  what's the meanest thing  you can say to Mark  say something mean back  because he's hitting you hard  let's go  call him a wiener again  yeah wow  why do we make fun  of people that are

[02:36:00]  the handsome one  yeah  I bet he could easily  just walk in  and put Zito in his place  oh no doubt  without a question  no doubt  alright where's that guy  not only with his boyish  good looks  but yeah  he probably's got some chops  yeah just drop his big  beautiful cock on the microphone  we'll all be stunned  into respect and silence  why is this dopey horse  dancing  how is this an Olympic sport  that's dressage  yeah  that's stupid  oh no  who are you  oh you're the kid  that made believe  you had sex with a hot chick  that's a pretty horse  fuck

[02:39:00]  to get hired  so  oh  oh  Sal say  you again  hey Zito do you wear your serious hat  so your chick remembers who you are  oh  now he wears the hat  so hopefully Anthony would go  oh  put two and two together  boo  oh god  oh my jeez  I fucking hate myself  Jimmy's head is buried in his hands  now I can't see Ronnie  everyone just feels a lot  now I can't see Ronnie  he wears that hat  so hopefully
