<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts self-deprecatingly labeling themselves the "dumbest guys in radio" and engaging in vulgar language.  The primary focus then shifted to the disappearance of Andrew Koenig, the actor known for playing "Boner" on *Growing Pains*.  Opie and Anthony speculated about a possible suicide, citing reports of Koenig giving away his possessions and exhibiting signs of depression.  Their discussion was heavily laced with crude jokes and vulgar language, including repeated references to genitalia.  A listener called in, offering additional details about Koenig's disappearance, mentioning Kirk Cameron's attempt to reach him via Twitter.  The hosts continued their vulgar banter and speculation about Koenig's fate and the state of his remains. The conversation then abruptly transitioned to a discussion of Tony Kornheiser and what the hosts considered to be an inappropriately revealing outfit worn by Hannah Storm on ESPN.  This segment, too, was characterized by vulgar descriptions of Storm's attire. No guests were present in the studio during this broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken, we are the dumbest  guys in radio.  Ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place sucks. 
[00:00:30]  There's no mistake about it, we are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  What will happen today?  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  Oh, you want me to fuck your dick?  One girl told me my balls smell like a ham and monster on wheat.  I'm going to sneak you from slow go.  This is going to be another stupid show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  As far as we're concerned.  As far as we're concerned.  Here at Sirius XM.  Satellite radio!  Day two of this rainy mess here in New York City.  Oh, I thought it was Boner Watch.  Day two, or is it day three of Boner Watch?  I think it's day three of the Boner Watch.  Day two of this awful rain in New York City.  Yeah.  It's like...  I gave up on Boner. 
[00:01:30]  It's like seven out there.  Boner is a goner.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that how you're pronouncing him dead?  I think they're just hoping to find him before the wolves don't completely...  Rip him apart.  Rip him apart.  Yeah.  Poor Boner.  Apparently, all the earmarks of suicide...  Oh, really?  He gave away a lot of stuff.  He returned things to friends, gifts they had given him.  You know, things like that. 
[00:02:00]  Which are pretty much benchmarks of, I'm going to kill myself.  If you're going to kill yourself, wouldn't you just kill yourself?  No, a lot of people kind of do this whole...  They kind of want to wrap up their life?  Yeah, wrap it up.  Wrap it up.  Give away a lot of their possessions.  Act despondent.  He was despondent.  And then he disappeared, so...  And I think he's upset that everybody's still just calling him Boner.  Poor Boner.  I don't even know his name. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, Boner.  Konig.  Yeah, whatever.  So, yeah, I guess that's a big story.  Was his sister on Larry King or something?  Oh, really?  Why would you go on Larry King if your brother is missing?  What's her name?  Engorged Clitoris?  Who is she?  I don't know.  Why am I going to try to fucking...  Boner.  Huh?  Wet pussy.  Wet pussy.  Wet pussy and Boner. 
[00:03:00]  That's terrible.  Oh, no.  Yeah?  Guys, I've got to call myself a big giant prick.  He probably should.  Shut up.  Well, good morning.  Morning.  You know what?  Oh, boy.  I'll bounce you.  Do you want the Boner story?  Yeah, the latest.  I mean, why not?  Because then we'll be up to date when they find his fucking skull. 
[00:03:30]  When they finally find his skull in the woods of fucking Vancouver.  Come on.  You'd never notice if you went a week without seeing someone from the 80s sitcom Growing Pains,  but you might notice if you were related to them.  Andrew Koenig is that missing star.  He might be...  What the hell is this?  ...happy for a missing, perhaps, suicidal gentleman?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Hey, hey, you're right.  Hey, hey, hey.  Boner.  What show is this from? 
[00:04:00]  You think his jaw dropped yet?  Wow.  Yeah.  What show is it from?  I don't know.  Sorry, you might be asking Andrew who?  He's Andrew Koenig, son of Walter Koenig, who played Chekhov on the original Star Trek.  The younger Koenig was last seen a week ago in Vancouver.  He's best known for playing a character named Boner on the 80s sitcom Growing Pains.  So Boner is missing.  His father says his son was depressed over recent business failures.  He went up there to see his friends. 
[00:04:30]  He has some very close friends up there.  And Vancouver is the place that he really felt most comfortable.  He's been depressed.  He's been depressed.  He's trying to get ahead in this business.  And he's been working at it a long time.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  He lost his Russian accent.  Oh, really?  It was Chekhov.  Yeah.  Sounds like a woman, doesn't he?  I thought it was.  It might be an older woman.  It said, I'm super saver Lillian. 
[00:05:00]  What the hell happened to Chekhov?  Damn.  He lost his accent.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Let's say hi to Pat in Staten Island.  Pat.  Pat.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Kevin from Connecticut really passed.  He writes, get out of here.  Boner was on a show called Growing Pains.  Get it?  Yeah.  Growing Pains, right?  Well, that's kind of funny. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, it is Growing Pains.  Oh, I get it.  It's the Boner.  Yeah.  All right.  Boner, Growing Pains?  Sure.  All right.  Pat, what do you got?  Yeah, Kirk Cameron, who played Mike Seaver on that show, him and Boner were good buddies.  And I saw on what you were just listening to, if you keep going, in that show, he said that  they could always work things out on the show, you know, as Mike Seaver and Boner, to get  in touch with him, they can talk it out. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, that's what Kirk Cameron put the word out for him.  He's reaching out to him.  Reaching out on Twitter?  Reaching out on Twitter?  Exactly.  Punch it out.  All right.  Well.  They might find him through Twitter, you think?  No.  No.  How do you Twitter from, you know, beyond?  From the great beyond?  I don't know.  You think it's completely over?  All right.  What's he doing?  What else would he be doing right now?  With his Eddie Vedder hair?  He went the whole route there. 
[00:06:30]  Through the hair.  Yeah.  Just walking around.  What is he, you know, walking around Canada?  No, I think not.  I think they're going to find a...  Well, it seems some animals have gotten to the body.  But if he was going to kill himself, wouldn't he keep it all nice for his family?  Because he seemed like he was giving all his stuff away and tidying up his life, right?  Yeah.  So why would you now just walk into the woods of Vancouver or wherever and just kind of do yourself in it in such a way that they might not ever find your body? 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  Oh, well.  I guess we'll, you know, we'll keep you updated on the Boner story.  I don't think there's much left there.  Just like Boner.  Kevin's now writing back.  Opie said Boner was on a show called Grown Pains.  Oh.  But that's...  Groin Pains.  Groin Pains.  It could go Groin Pains. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, maybe that's what he wrote.  Groin Pains.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  It's too early to read.  Stupid reading.  Gets me every morning.  Words.  Actually, this Tony Kornheiser, I read that story.  Did you hear what happened on ESPN?  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck?  I can't fucking insult a woman on ESPN.  I don't think we could ever go back to regular radio.  They got some rules.  Crazy ass rules.  This Tony Kornheiser, obviously trying to make a joke.  If you know anything about Tony Kornheiser, he's a little edgy and stuff. 
[00:08:00]  You know, nothing crazy, but he gets the job done.  He's not just a regular, you know, sports guy.  Right.  And I guess Hannah Storm wore, like, some kind of slutty outfit.  Yeah.  We could say it here, right?  It was some slutty outfit.  Yeah. </pre>
