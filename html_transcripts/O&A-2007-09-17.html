<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of a disastrous comedy tour van ride from Camden, NJ.  The hosts detailed a near-accident caused by their intoxicated driver, followed by a physical altercation with a pedestrian who punched their van.  This was followed by a recounting of a disastrous gambling trip to the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, where one host suffered significant monetary losses and lost his iPhone.  A lengthy call with a listener named Jimmy dominated a portion of the show, focusing on the turbulent state of his relationship and specific arguments with his girlfriend, including one that occurred before a show.  The hosts interspersed these personal anecdotes with discussions about various pop culture events, including their football picks, a guest's weight gain, video game scores, and the Emmy Awards.

The show then transitioned to a detailed discussion of O.J. Simpson's arrest for armed robbery in Las Vegas.  The hosts played audio from the robbery itself, highlighting Simpson's angry voice, and discussed the potential charges against him, including assault with a deadly weapon and robbery. They commented on Simpson's demeanor in his mugshot and speculated on his motivations, referencing his financial difficulties and the controversy surrounding Fred Goldman's book, "If I Did It." They also played a clip of Simpson’s rap song.  Other news items covered included a missed call segment concerning a confusing Jets game play, a plane crash in Thailand, the death of a disabled man from a massive bee attack, Britney Spears’ custody battle, the sale of Barry Bonds’ record-breaking home run ball, Larry King’s on-air gaffe with Denise Brown, and Sally Field’s Emmy acceptance speech.  There was also a segment on early puberty in girls.  Danny and Kenny were mentioned as being part of the show's regular staff.


The broadcast continued with a segment about the lowering age of puberty in U.S. girls, featuring a doctor as a guest.  The hosts engaged in crude, sexually suggestive humor throughout this discussion, interspersing it with their own vulgar anecdotes about puberty.  The focus then shifted to the hosts’ anxieties surrounding a potential merger between XM and Sirius radio, filled with speculation about job security, potential layoffs, and internal company politics. This segment involved much vulgar language and speculation about the impact on their show's programming and compensation. A call-in segment featured a discussion about a 5th-grade class accidentally exposed to pornography. This was followed by a phone interview with Chris Cox, a DJ from XM Channel 81, who played and discussed songs from his Eurotechno playlist, a segment also marked by the hosts' crude and sexually explicit humor. The broadcast concluded with further speculation on the XM/Sirius merger and the hosts creating sound effects mimicking the electronic music discussed earlier.  No other guests besides the doctor and Chris Cox were explicitly mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Two-controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man, I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  that he's very, very depressed  because his refrigerator door fell off. 
[00:01:00]  It made a break for him.  Obi and Anthony.  Stupid Australians  whose national hero got killed  by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Shake it up.  Oh, hi. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  We're back at home base.  Where is home base?  Uh, well, people listen all over.  So we're in your town.  Let's try to fake it.  We're in Pittsburgh.  Is that where we are?  Don't tell anyone.  And don't try to find us.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Obi and Anthony show.  Hi.  The O and A virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:00]  My God.  My God, man.  And we say goodbye to the comedy tour.  Bye-bye.  Eight, nine dates.  How many?  How many?  Dude, I lost count.  I lost track.  I have no idea.  I just know, uh, as we were all taking that final drive from the venue back to the hotel,  the van was very quiet.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  I think we're all just kind of, all right, time to go to sleep and then just get out of Dodge  and continue doing the show.  Well, that's nice because I didn't have a quiet, uh, drive back to the hotel for the  venue.  I wouldn't imagine that you, uh, you would have.  What, you heard what happened?  Not at all, but, but you had quite the crew.  No.  Oh, no, no, no.  The Philly crew went their own way.  Oh, okay.  Now, of course, we're talking about the, uh, the comedy show we had at the Tweeter Center 
[00:03:00]  in Camden, New Jersey, Saturday night.  And, uh, no, the Philly crew, they all took the, uh, limo back to Northeast.  But, um, we got in a van around two in the morning because we had like a, a little party  for the crew and everybody that was on tour with us this summer, wrapping up the comedy  tour, right?  Oh, the wrap party, right, with the, uh, the keg of, uh, light beer and the boxes of 
[00:03:30]  wine.  And, uh, a couple of cheesesteaks.  Yeah.  A couple of veggie cheesesteaks and a couple of regular cheesesteaks.  And, uh, some of those Fig Newtons.  And margaritas and the thing that said lemonade.  It was like a big cooler that you pressed.  Oh, really?  It said lemonade and it's margaritas.  Not one non-alcoholic beverage at that party.  Not one.  People were going, could I get a water?  And it was like, no, we don't, we don't have any water.  No, we don't, uh, yeah.  The budget for this tour, you know, we can't afford water at this time.  Didn't you see that elaborate set? 
[00:04:00]  We can't afford water.  Those strippers, they cost money.  Yeah.  We got the, the best of almost the best.  I'm so glad that's over.  It was great meeting fans all over the country all summer, but, uh, we're a bit crispy, a  little tired.  It was time to put that concept to bed for now.  Totally burnt.  Oh, we're working on some new ideas for next summer already, but, uh, it's way too early 
[00:04:30]  to start, uh, playing our hand, but, uh.  Way too early to start, uh, discussing ruining another summer.  Yeah, I know.  Ah, what the hell.  We just love what we do.  Yeah, it was fun.  We love hanging with the fans.  We, uh, you know, we like giving them a little extra.  Other radio shows, they just do the show.  We, uh, we try to do a little extra.  A little, a little extra.  We get out there.  And then they still bitch.  Then they'll still find something to bitch about, even though.  That happens.  Even though we don't have to go on tour all summer. 
[00:05:00]  We really don't.  Like, the amount of money we make doing it is nothing to brag about, you know?  It's not as much as the comics make.  Yeah, but our faithful.  I'm sure.  But our faithful listeners will still find something to bitch about.  I mean, we could just come in here and just do the radio show and go home.  We don't have to do book signings or comedy tours or, we don't have to do anything.  We don't have to ever appear in public again, but we choose to.  Why do we do it?  I don't know.  It's our love of the fans. 
[00:05:30]  But anyway, so, uh, after the, um, the after, after party, whatever you want to call it,  uh, we got into a van around, what, two in the morning?  Danny, close to two in the morning?  Yes, sir.  Something like that?  Yes, sir.  And, uh, we're waiting in the van and we have no driver.  Oh.  And then I noticed the driver kind of, kind of walking a little weird toward the van.  Ooh.  A little weird toward the van.  A little ziggy zaggy, was he, uh, walking?  And of course, as soon as he gets in, Kenny's like, where were you? 
[00:06:00]  Just on his case immediately.  Yeah.  And he's like, I had to get some coffee.  And I'm like, ooh, walking a little weird and has a cup of coffee.  Like, he's, he's hoping, in my mind, I'm thinking, oh, he's hoping to sober up really fast with a cup of coffee.  Right.  For the long ride back into, uh, you know, Philly to drop us off at the hotel.  So, uh, we start our drive and we're all just kind of, you know, not paying attention, talking to each other.  Kenny's like, maybe on a phone call or something.  Next thing you know, the van stops short and we all go flying forward. 
[00:06:30]  Flying forward, hitting our heads and whatever body part would hit the seat in front of you.  And Kenny's like, what the F is wrong with you?  And he goes, oh, I thought the light was red.  It was green.  Oh, boy.  He jammed on the brakes at a green light.  And then his excuse was he saw a red light ahead and I don't know.  Sure.  He kind of lost track because I guess the lights were stacked up, right?  Right, Kenny?  Is this true so far?  So far, so good, GH.  And then all of a sudden, uh, Kenny has to go, that's one strike. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  And now we're all paranoid.  Now I'm just staring at the driver like, is this guy okay to drive?  What was the second one where you basically said, dude, are you okay to drive?  Let me drive.  When we were emerging at the toll booth at the Ben Franklin Bridge and he almost collided with another truck to try to merge into the toll booth.  And I'm going like, that's strike two.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  And then he starts mouthing off at me. 
[00:07:30]  He's going, dude, it's not my fault.  What do you want from me?  I'm a good driver.  I'm this, that, and the other thing.  And I'm going, that's strike three for talking back.  Yeah.  So now he's got the unmitigated goal to say to me, I'll give you strike four because I play cricket.  Are you kidding me?  I'm thinking to myself, what do little bugs have to do with it?  But he does use a cricket line.  And then we're not laughing.  He goes, well, I thought, you know, you guys are comedians.  I thought you'd have a sense of humor. 
[00:08:00]  And we're thinking, we don't have a sense of humor right now because we're not sure if you're going to drive off the bridge into the water.  Like driving around thinking you're going to die.  Right.  That wasn't a good joke anyway.  How could you laugh at that?  Yeah.  Sucked.  And that's what sucks about, you know, going on tour for the summer.  You've got to count on people for rides in the middle of the night.  And this guy.  I wasn't in that van.  This guy, in my humble opinion, should not have been driving.  Yeah.  Right.  And then all of a sudden we're getting close to the hotel and we're on the side streets. 
[00:08:30]  And all of a sudden a guy punches the van really hard.  Yeah.  And the reason.  Why would he do that?  Because this guy almost ran him over.  Oh.  But the guy didn't know.  He almost ran him over.  So you know when someone does, like, cuts you off on a street, you'll hit their car or something?  Yeah.  They have no clue.  So the guy just keeps driving.  How many strikes does Kenny give?  What kind of ball are you playing?  Well, he plays cricket, Anthony.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then.  I say strike three. 
[00:09:00]  Usually you're out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then he waits about an hour.  He's out of a job now.  He waits a light or two and then he goes, what was that noise?  I hope I didn't hit anyone back there.  Yeah.  He had great reaction two blocks later.  It was the worst reaction time ever.  I go, the noise was that you kind of pissed off a guy and he just punched your van and  we're lucky he didn't have a gun because it's two in the morning and who else is walking  around this late?  Fire some rounds through the back window.  That's nice.  And then Kenny just gets into a whole brawl with him, like, you know, I should be driving 
[00:09:30]  blah, blah, blah.  And then the guy's like, look, dude, I don't even need this job.  Really?  I don't even need this job.  Good.  Yeah.  He probably doesn't have it, right?  So then we get back to the hotel room and we notice that we're missing all sorts of  stuff.  And what happened was when he jammed, you know, stopped short on it at a green light, all  our stuff went flying forward into the van.  So I lost a cell phone and other things.  So we start calling the cell phone and all of a sudden this idiot's like, hello? 
[00:10:00]  I'm like, this is my cell phone.  Yeah.  Can you drop it off at the hotel?  Because I can't.  I got to go to South Philly.  And that's when Kenny got.  Oh, boy.  Kenny's like, drop the cell phone off at the hotel now.  Yeah.  He's like, I got to go to South Philly.  I'll be there in 40 minutes.  I'm like, we're going to sleep.  You get back here.  Get back here with my stuff.  Why would you not rough that guy up?  You should have roughed him up.  I know.  Or goon armed him.  I hit him in the pocketbook.  Because usually. 
[00:10:30]  In the pocketbook.  You know.  You got him by his purse strings.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  When we travel, O&A, they like to spread it around.  Makes it look good.  So we generously give the celebrity tips to everybody.  Well, yes.  This guy got nothing.  Good.  I couldn't leave the van fast enough.  Couldn't leave the van fast enough.  Did he bring the phone back?  Yes.  Yes.  South Philly.  I'll be back in 40 minutes.  Yeah.  You jackass. 
[00:11:00]  But I'm calling the phone.  And I guess he just assumed that it's his phone now.  Hello.  He's like, hello.  Not who is this or anything.  He was answering like it's now his cell phone.  Yeah.  So he was quite the character who will be on the unemployment line now.  Oh, you tell him.  Yeah.  Because Mason calls.  Live Nation takes no guff.  No.  Not like that.  No.  That's dangerous guff.  Yeah.  So with you, 17 strikes and you're out.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because he plays cricket.  Yeah.  And the first thing the guy says when we get in the van, he goes, yeah, my wife called  me three hours ago and said, just leave.  You don't need this crap.  And we're like, what crap?  Crap.  What?  Your job?  Yeah.  That you have to wait around until it's time to go back to the hotel?  You had to shut up.  Yeah.  Just because he's henpecked.  He's got to take it out on us.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We didn't even say anything to the guy.  Keep it to yourself.  And then he almost gets us in two to three car accidents on the way home. 
[00:12:00]  Unbelievable.  So you told the audience at the Tweeter Center on Saturday night, but you got to tell the  fine radio audience because they're listening all over the country about your fine, fine  casino experience.  A little road trip.  Yeah.  A little road trip.  A little road trip to the Borgata there in Atlantic City.  Went there and I took some of my winnings that I've been doing because I've been doing  very well.  This tour has been very well to me in these cities that have had casinos.  Uh, and, uh, I, I took some money with me and, um, went in and, um, just lost miserably. 
[00:12:30]  Lost miserably.  Uh, and I lost my cell phone, my iPhone.  No, no, it's funny.  Uh, you, you, you mentioned that on the stage Saturday night.  Yeah.  And, uh, you gotta love Philly.  They just start cheering.  They're cheering that, uh, that they, uh, were able to pretty much take me for, uh, about,  uh, about 30, 30, 30 Gs, 30 large, 30 large. 
[00:13:00]  And so we, we, we tell the crowd this and they start applauding.  I think they gave you a standing ovation.  Standing ovation.  They're just like cheering away, man.  It wasn't even that.  It was, it was that I lost my iPhone.  Yeah.  That annoyed me more.  Cause you love your iPhone.  I'm just starting to think I'm going, ah, those numbers are in there.  And then I'm thinking, I'm trying to think of other things like, all right, I was texting.  So it keeps a record of some of your texts and thank God I erased the ones to like, you 
[00:13:30]  know, fan and Danny, uh, cause we were like joking around and stuff and, uh, having a lot  of fun.  But you know, if you read it out of context, not knowing that we were joking, it might look  a little funny, but I had erased those, but I did leave one, you know, one or two to,  uh, uh, my girlfriend.  That was probably a little embarrassing.  There's pictures on there, but none bad.  Thank God.  There were no, you know, nudes or anything. 
[00:14:00]  Not like Paris Hilton's phone.  Basically, you're saying you're one of these guys that is happy that there was a plane crash  in Thailand.  Uh, why?  I don't know.  You're sounding a little suspicious right now.  Nah, cause you start thinking these things like what's on that phone?  What's on there?  Let me think.  Hmm.  But, uh, I'm surprised you guys didn't get any phone calls cause all your numbers are  in there.  And just in case people don't, aren't familiar with the names, your pictures pop up whenever  you put the phone numbers in.  Oh, great. 
[00:14:30]  Makes it very easy for everybody.  But the latest on that one, I did get a phone call and they found my phone.  Um, so, uh, now I gotta go through some kind of rigmarole to, uh, have them ship it back.  Hope they overnight it.  Where'd they find it?  I don't know.  I haven't talked to it.  I talked to like one person, but the, their lost and found section was closed.  So he gave me the name and like a case number and all kinds of things.  It's very complicated when you lose something.  It's not like, can I just look through that?  Did it fall behind the toilet stall when you were tapping? 
[00:15:00]  When I was tapping my foot?  No, I think it got a, I think it dislodged out of that lousy case that I had.  You know, they, I had the rubber case, which is good.  It saved the iPhone from many a drop, but it wouldn't have dropped if it wasn't for the  stupid clip that it goes in.  So I'm sitting there at some point, just hemorrhaging money, uh, realizing, oh my God,  I just have a clip on my hip and my phone's gone.  So Keith looked all over, couldn't find it.  So now I'm just really depressed. 
[00:15:30]  I'm annoyed.  And, and, uh, uh, this, this witch, Kathy, the dealer, this witch just, uh, took me, just  took me, dude, five hands in a row.  I got a 20 and, and pushed cause she also had a 25 times in a row.  And then the sixth time she beat me with a 21.  I had a 26 times in a row. 
[00:16:00]  And she finally, she gives a little, little, Hey, push, push, push five times.  What's a push mean?  That means you've got the same thing the dealer has.  So it's a push to wash.  No one wins.  No one loses.  You should be happy with a push.  At least you didn't lose.  Five times in a row.  And then the sixth time she gets it anyway.  I hated Kathy.  I was wishing death on her.  And she, uh, she, uh, yeah, I got up finally realized, you know, no, I'm just getting up.  I'm leaving.  Went to another table, started doing well. 
[00:16:30]  And then they changed the dealer.  The cooler comes in.  There was no, I wasn't able to get traction.  I wasn't able to get any traction.  You can get a nice stack.  You gamblers are hilarious with your terminology.  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  I just never got traction.  Once you get a little traction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you build your pile up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you could start like making some, some, some bigger bets.  The beginning of the night is always the riskiest.  Unless you just get in there and start winning like crazy.  Uh, so I noticed my phone's gone and I'm just pissed and I get up and we're leaving. 
[00:17:00]  So I take my, my clip.  That is the reason my phone disappeared.  And I wing it.  I go F this thing.  I wing it.  And it ends up about 15 feet away in the, the payout section of a slot machine.  Like it was a great shot.  It just went like, tank, tank, tank, tank.  So I'm walking, I get about 20 feet away and some woman comes up with the clip. 
[00:17:30]  It's not even a woman that works there or anything.  Goes, excuse me, sir.  I saw you drop this and hands it to me.  And I'm looking at her in amazement.  Like when is throwing something 15 feet in anger, dropping it?  You dummy.  So I went, oh, thank you.  And just threw it into a garbage pail.  Dunce.  There you go.  Yeah.  After three pushes, you got to double down. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, just double down.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's, it's actually not, um, terminology is a little off, but I did raise the bet because  I'm like, come on.  Bad.  No, so I got beat up a little bit there.  Mm-hmm.  It happens.  You can't win them all.  I like saying that.  Ah, you're still ahead for the summer. 
[00:18:30]  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  We're just getting started.  Jimmy, how are you?  We didn't even say how to you yet.

[00:25:30]  to i gotta go i want to wish you best luck but i'm telling you you sound really bummed so i hope  you either do something about it get rid of her or because you're too nice of a guy to be bummed out  all the time thank you i'm adorable all right then yeah i'm very pinchable she likes when i talk  about being like when i say that i like my cheeks pinched pinched she likes that yeah  you pinch ouch that pinches so you got a little more so you got a little more info out of her  i haven't forgotten jimmy so and then you heard what you needed to hear and then you lose it 
[00:26:00]  well i wouldn't say i lost it i was just i was just i didn't get really really angry to her back at  the hotel like as far as um losing it because it was it was just like i was so in such a crap  mood at the venue which was at that awful after party um i'm you know i can't drink alcohol  uh so of course there's nothing non-alcoholic there and there's awful cheesesteaks and some  doodads yeah the uh wrap party uh i was just irritated so we get back to the hotel and i'm  theorizing again and uh and then she's just like well go ahead just keep making up stories you're good 
[00:26:30]  at that and uh i would have bit through my lip if it wouldn't have left a scar oh and then it got  really ugly keep making up hey go ahead keep making up stories you're good at that go ahead  make up scenarios oh no it was just just relaying that i was making my jaw go and um you know we  just this was nasty i mean we did the nasty nasty part was only a few minutes because kenny was coming  so we couldn't we didn't fight yeah because you uh you guys took off in new york late real late 
[00:27:00]  saturday night yes we left oh and uh we we left and we drove about 10 minutes over the bridge and  then she realized she forgot her computer so we had to go back oh that must have um that must have  made you happy too it wasn't far enough for me to get annoyed at uh it was just like uh i didn't i  think that was it was like whatever let's just go back for it i couldn't you know it's 15 extra  minutes so what and uh what was that and kenny dropped her off and i went home made some phone 
[00:27:30]  calls it was too late oh jesus  wow so what's gonna happen jimmy i don't know actually i don't know i mean um she's not particularly  thrilled either i don't know she's probably the same as i am just kind of numb like you love the  person but you're like yeah what are you gonna do man i can't keep i can't even just say it's her  fault it's like i fight too i just yeah whatever man they're not good in relationships i'm just not 
[00:28:00]  good this has to be record setting uh longest one probably not a long one was over two years  oh really two yeah it's not even a year yet oh okay so is this the end of it i don't know if it's  the end of it but i don't know i mean i'm not gonna call i don't expect her to no no so that  could just then it just that pretty much makes it just go away one of us will call you know i'll send 
[00:28:30]  some vicious text yeah yeah something awful you're gonna send a vicious text i mean i know myself i'll  send something nasty come get your ass out of my apartment you know right she called you an animal  yeah because you're like spitting and on the wall yeah and then it was uh we're in the truck and  kenny went to get something in the truck and uh she's in the back and i'm in the front and i'm just  staring straight ahead and i'm like i'm gonna have him just drop you off at your apartment like we're 
[00:29:00]  really mad at each other and she didn't say anything i'm like okay she's like yeah i heard you  you're just trying to engage me i'm not interested oh wow you gotta give her a little credit for that  i wanted to get out of the car that's kind of a good one that's kind of good you gotta give her  that one that is a good jab here's what was good i would i wanted to close the door gently and set  the truck on  that was exactly what i was trying to do that's horrible yes that's why you guys are meant for 
[00:29:30]  each other because she gives you good game jimmy she gives you good game damn i don't mind that but  sometimes when i'm arguing with somebody like i i would just at least like somebody who is good with  a timeline of facts and she's not very good at that like she's just she'll start arguing about  something like yeah well you do the same thing to me it's like all right well yeah i know that but  we're dealing with this now two wrongs don't make a right we're dealing with the the part where you  did it yes i mean we we deal with it severely when i do it so right right so now it's that part i'm just 
[00:30:00]  so confused how it turns so quickly jimmy because uh we we did the big live broadcast at the uh at the  tla on south street in philly uh and then by 11 in the morning we're all walking down south street  just kind of enjoying each other's company you're holding her hand and you guys look like you're just  lovey-dovey having a great little morning together yeah we had fun we had fun that night  and uh then the next uh we get a blade the next day but it was yeah it was fun it was a fun fest 
[00:30:30]  from saturday night but then it just turned like harshly yeah i mean dramatically how does it turn  does something happen does someone say one thing that is just a non-sequitur to what's been going on  typically she's better at ending a fight than i am i'm very bad at letting it go when i'm angry  i i don't know where it comes from childhood probably i don't know but it won't it's like  it just it overwhelms me i get so mad yeah um and and she's like all right she said you're sorry 
[00:31:00]  she's like look i'm sorry that was that was crappy i shouldn't have said that um you know i i was i've  stopped you know she she's i'll say that for her she's very good at coming out and going look let's  not fight i was wrong or whatever if she's right but i i just can't like no it's too late now i don't  want to hear you wrong now is it always uh a fight over something different or do you guys got  some kind of issue that you have not been able to resolve i don't know like something that keeps  coming up and you're just look you know what i mean well we all have running themes like things 
[00:31:30]  that will prop up from time to time but i i think a major part of the problem is that i can't let it go  until the anger goes away i can't like just get rid of it when i'm angry um because i'm certain  there's a part of me that i so refuse to be a doormat like i i just i if i accept your apology  and give you a hug then i'm just some cuckold i'm just some pee whipped that took it you know  what i mean and then which is kind of crazy in a relationship to think that way someone says look 
[00:32:00]  i'm sorry i screwed up you got to kind of okay you screwed up whatever so what but i can't do that  i'm really bad at that i'm very bad at it my therapist wants to know where's the anger  from what from what where's that coming from no it's an angry boy well it's from whatever it's  not from here earth what what do you mean by air does air anger you i mean the adult life it's  yeah it's issues with women i think yeah yeah you know how it is they're all awful i'm gonna bet 
[00:32:30]  i'm gonna bet by uh uh not tomorrow but by wednesday we're gonna hear that things are going okay  again it's possible i who knows we've heard this so many times i know it's up and down man up and  down i always get in these man i'm up and i'm down i'm very weird with living like i never have one  woman just serve every purpose right yeah yeah you need a cavalcade well yeah like i can't just be  like happy with one person one for sex one for fun one to be a bitch one to argue with one to talk 
[00:33:00]  two one to just cuddle with on a punch i need hogging dogs well when you have one yeah but we  only have one spoon i don't like doing that she oh she hates like i do this to annoy her like i'll  take the ice cream and i'll suck the ice cream and i'll leave half of it but a very oh yeah very  smooth that is the heart left here oh gross man yeah it really bugs her that would it's the little 
[00:33:30]  satisfying moments of a relationship you're stupid finish your rocky road  at least your cowboys won yesterday jimmy there you go i was big one for the cowboys but i heard that  later i heard that later at night i didn't watch the game and my stupid jets almost came back and won  that game yesterday with our backup quarterback oh yeah is pennington out yeah he's out how long  i think he might come back uh this week i think yeah what's your quarterback's name i don't i honestly 
[00:34:00]  don't know he did a great job isn't it some jets fan i am huh roger clemens uh something clemens  right i don't even know i don't know he looked really impressive though i just i was all tired driving  in and i'm listening to the news and i went wait a minute roger clemens is playing for the jets  what's his name travis what kellen kellen clemens right okay very good okay yeah you that was pretty  accurate yeah and then uh of course uh tiger woods won the fedex cup but i beat him yesterday oh you 
[00:34:30]  did you kicked his ass yeah tiger woods doesn't win when i play him ah when uh what course were you  playing him on i played him uh i i played him on the blue uh monster yesterday wow i played him uh  on the tpc yesterday out of boston i played uh uh the links of st andrews and st andrews  invented the game called a cough without the l  because i'm better at the mouse than he is okay i thought for a second you were playing tiger woods but 
[00:35:00]  of course you were playing i was playing tiger woods station as he was winning on tv and i'm  laughing i'm like ah look at me kick his ass look i'm kicking his ass on the computer that's where it  really matters you're kicking his ass all right how much money he's pocketing from you buying that i  just know how to take them the mouse and bring it back nicely yeah and bring it forward getting some  nice golf swings with my mouse got to get online with that start playing people all over the country i'm 
[00:35:30]  going to but i that's fun this is the first time i played tiger woods on the computer it's usually on  the psp or the playstation but so i got to get my skills back up because with the psp tiger woods  this will interest maybe a hundred people out there i was shooting in the 40s yeah like completely  ridiculous i was down to i was averaging in like the mid 50s but getting a lot of rounds in the 40s  and i finally had to get rid of the psp version like boring you mean so now it's huh the 40s like  the year surprised he was allowed to play i was shooting i was shooting like 48s which basically 
[00:36:00]  means you got to get a birdie on every hole and you got to get six eagles in one round it's it's  it's ridiculous what does that mean oh forget it jimmy i know that they're like less than you're  supposed to have for a birdie's one under what you're supposed to do for a hole and an eagle is  two under so if it's a par three you got to get a hole in one why don't they just call it  something that sounds like that's the best you can get 18 should be like the best no you're every 
[00:36:30]  golf course because you can't get a one that's a whole 560 yards long no one can drive five really  good yards if you're really good work out harder in 18 i shot at 18 how about you yeah shot at 18  i shot in 11 a couple of them bounced in one hole and then continue  i like how you simplify everything jimmy but tiger won about uh 12 million dollars yesterday  12 he wins 10 million for the fedex cup the inaugural year of the fedex cup which is like 
[00:37:00]  this playoff thing the pj's doing i don't whatever but he won so he won 10 million and then he won the  tournament for another i think uh 1.3 something like that so basically his caddy steve yeah uh makes 10  of what tiger makes so steve made well over a million dollars yesterday carrying a golf bag  basically making more money than most of the players that tiger beat yesterday  that's a 10 i believe it's 10 of uh tigers winnings does a caddy justify that i don't know 
[00:37:30]  the guy is tiger woods i don't think i think he knows what club to use i think he can look at a lie  uh and and and know how he should putt which way the greens breaking uh he's a bag carrier yeah but  i think you need to have that that guy that you know you just he's there for you you know him very  well yeah he's uh calm under pressure yeah under pressure oh oh i gotta reach in the bag and get him 
[00:38:00]  a club well these pga guys they they change caddies all the time because they're not feeling something  with their caddy a chemistry or what it's probably a luck good luck bad luck thing you know where you're  just like ah this guy ain't lucky yeah toss him toss him aside how long has this guy been with him  oh god it's a while now he he started with that walrus looking guy that did what was his name with  the the gray freaking mustache i don't remember the caddies names i forgot his name but tiger wasn't a big  fan of his uh fluff fluff was his name something like that sounds and he got rid of fluff and then he went with 
[00:38:30]  uh with uh with uh this steve guy who's an athlete in his own right in his home country of uh  wherever kiwi is there a country called kiwi you can be a kiwi yeah i know new zealand by the way uh  congratulations to who who won uh this week's picks eric no eric wait how many games rock and winner  cannot be in the same sentence how many football picks do we do every week seven yeah but i think 
[00:39:00]  it's seven yeah you went seven for seven this week that i'm not sure but uh i just know i won what  five uh for seven oh he went five for seven okay and a little controversy we're doing the football  picks every week with the staff here and everyone was nervous because my brother's now doing my picks  for me and they had nothing to be nervous about i did i i got three wins this week out of seven my  brother's picks sucked see brother elmo's picks suck because now he's uh he's playing it up he knows 
[00:39:30]  that it's in the spotlight and the pressure's on and uh he's choking he's getting cocky too because  he's mp3 uh audio files for his uh football picks he's podcasting his uh football picks and we couldn't  play him last week because we were on location but maybe this week he's doing he's doing a little  something something he's trying to take it all hollywood and he's uh choking he is choking three  out of seven elmo with board reflect 
[00:40:00]  but eroc won the football pool this week uh travis is in the lead as far as the whole season goes  and uh and there you have it how much does eroc win for uh 250 you won 250 dollars very good  and me did did you ever give back uh uh dr ian smith's money nope so give him 150 and send 100  to dr ian smith i think he owes him uh 200 right how much you owe dr ian smith oh 500 five so give  him the 250 and now you owe him 250 more and eroc i noticed you're getting fatter again what's 
[00:40:30]  happening with you oh thanks i saw you get out of your car this morning i'm like and i thought to  myself getting a bit chubby you're getting married this is the time where you got to get your body  together what was your lowest weight that you got down to 195 what are you up to now i think i'm at  200 which means get the scale which means get the scale i say you're close to 207 eroc you have to 
[00:41:00]  why i say you gotta go because people notice when you gain weight eroc here's the deal you  are getting married to a a hot number she's beautiful okay so you gotta get your this is  how it works with every guy you gotta get just yourself in shape for the marriage and the  honeymoon like you really got to work your way for the next year or you're getting down to 185 180  where people like damn he's looking good yeah and then when she gets pregnant that's when you sneak 
[00:41:30]  back in there and then gain the weight and you fall apart then no one's gonna give a crap she's  getting fat you're getting fat you're sharing haagen-dazs and one spoon no one gets fat right  before the wedding no that's when the girl starts looking at you and going you know that's where you  look at each other and you really start assessing each other going now is this really you know it could  be in the back of your head you're going is this really the right move and she's looking at you and  going you know if this is what he's doing before we're married after we're married i'm gonna be 
[00:42:00]  like with a big fat guy dead girls think that  could you get on the scale and humor us really fast steve's behind you he'll lift you up and throw  you on it if need be dan in connecticut real fast dan as eroc gets up eroc i gotta go to break so we  gotta see that you got fatter before break hurry up uh dan what's up oh he's under contract the uh  caddy for tiger woods huh he's under contract he doesn't he doesn't get ten percent uh i i read 
[00:42:30]  somewhere he gets ten percent so is that what his contract says no i don't know what his contract is  but what if his contract is he gets ten percent dummy no not at all how do you know you don't know  what his contract is wow then i i read something uh a while ago but what's this guy saying i read  that his caddy gets ten percent of what uh tiger makes on the golf course not the endorsements and  all that other crap all right we'll have to find out dan it'll be interesting to see how much he's 
[00:43:00]  making you know well how much of the strategy strategy or strategizing goes into the caddy i  don't know enough about golf as far as i'm concerned there should be one club that you're  swimming with apparently there's like eight well i was a i need a four i got a big club here i got  a nine yeah give me a two with a six handle what that means i was i was a caddy for uh 14 years and uh  i'm on the level i was caddying on i mean i was i was caddying for guys that are scratch golfers though 
[00:43:30]  they were they were shooting 70 72 every time around project and even those guys uh i and other  caddies were very important to them because you just know the lay of the land and you kind of  pay attention to what what you know those the wind and all that but i'm thinking someone like tiger  a level of tiger woods really probably doesn't need all that he's not playing on courses that he  hasn't played before either right it's like you know the guys that were playing uh at your golf course  some of them had never played there so you kind of give them a little ins and outs of the things 
[00:44:00]  but what's his caddy telling tiger well he's got that little book so he's like  last time you were here you you used a seven iron and the wind was five miles an hour well  today you're in the exact same spot but the wind is ten miles an hour okay all right that makes  some sense so he keeps got something going on he's got the little book with all the stats for  him how about carrying a laptop that would do the same thing just just hit the button and it'll tell  you yeah put the pencil behind his ear i'd love to be tiger's caddy all right look there's the hole 
[00:44:30]  you gotta get the ball in get it in hey really fast five to ten percent plus salary that's what  tiger woods's caddy gets yeah the numbers aren't aren't official you know because only tiger knows  what you know what he's paying his guy but that's that's what they're figuring out saying five to ten  plus salary plus salary so guaranteed salary like look if i turn into a hat golfer you know this year  you're still going to make some good cash yeah carrying my bag i'll bet you tiger's guy makes five  percent i bet there's a salary in case of an injury only in case if he's injured and can't play  probably get something probably makes five six hundred a game perhaps more than that ant all 
[00:45:00]  right eroc why why is your arms folded this is ridiculous huh why would the mic be on i don't  know oh oh again go ahead because this is ridiculous why is this ridiculous i'm the only one that gets  subject to this but no one else like loses the weight and then uh puffs up as much as you do you're  the only one we notice goes up and down look at us we're at the same weight what's your weight  fluctuation in in like a six month period uh i've been eating like crap haven't been to the gym i've 
[00:45:30]  gained five pounds yeah it's like i have a that's it i have a two and a half pound swing one way or the  other yeah i got pretty much it five pounds for me five pounds you go up and down all the time look at  travis well of course you're not going to weigh travis is 26 pounds every single time eight years  old sam does sam look fatter where we're my god where this would be a good bit to get sam on a  scale yeah wow sam gained uh a third of a pound even steve he's holding the camera even steve has 
[00:46:00]  been holding steady for many years i can't tell if he loses weight or gains weight he's been the same  way for steve put a few on oh boy don't tell him why but he knows he's probably from muscle don't  tell him that because big arms he looks good he is obsessed with his workouts his weight his  formulas his steroids 11 excuse the road has been just killing me all right go ahead iraq so you said  uh you're what 195 100 195 was his lightest that he was oh you say now he's saying he's 200 so i'm 
[00:46:30]  saying 210 here he goes it's on the scale i'm gonna go with 207  what was it uh it's pushing 206 there 206 yeah but you do have clothes on i think when you weighed  at 205 if i remember you were in your boxer briefs you had almost nothing so you're probably actually  lighter than that here he goes he wants to prove that he's not that heavy look at these cheeks here 
[00:47:00]  they come uh steve jimmy called you fat by the way yeah he knows you're getting a little chubby yeah  no he's he's actually right i did put on about uh 10 pounds after i got off my ridiculous bodybuilder  diet oh but i got a new diet which is even more restrictive so i should be going back down again  so back down new diet i understand tapping your foot in the old stall waiting for the old tapped  back what was that 30 seconds and i'm gay again all right  well actually that was 10 seconds that was all there goes steve 
[00:47:30]  seconds i'm gay there's steve with his restricted diet dude you got to put more e-rock clips on  foundry on opiathe.com whatever you call it i wanted to i was trying to show my girlfriend clips of eric  we were talking about him oh so she still is your girlfriend yeah yeah this was this was friday  when uh i was trying to show clips of eric when uh we talked about he got engaged i'm like yeah he got  choked up and i see sam with the video camera and i'm like all right let me go i couldn't find it  anywhere yeah it's just for sam's private collection yeah he has like hours of tape of eric that he just 
[00:48:00]  sits at home watches and laughs at all right listen we gotta take a break so uh what are you down to now  get up there with your it's the same 204 all right there you go so you've only gained 10 pounds in  the last month jesus have you been eating poorly eric uh kind of not as bad as i used to but not as

[00:55:30]  what makes me puke is hollywood they all have to wear the yankees caps because what is it hip to wear  yankees cap if you're in hollywood is that it you see it over and over again by the way we know the  emmys were last night who gives a crap your favorite show won congratulations uh well that's what i try  to watch it it's such a bore fest i was like you know what watch the emmys and be informed and and  then be on the radio the next day and no one cares or get an extra hour sleep i went for the extra 
[00:56:00]  hour sleep but i came in i said did anything exciting happen because remember back in the day award  shows there was always something cool that was happening someone would get up there without a  bra and you get to see everything or some idiot would do one-arm push-ups or i don't know you get  an indian running running out from the crowd to to do the acceptance speech for some big star yeah now  it's like nothing happens they're too scared they don't want anything uh to go off script so they get 
[00:56:30]  very scared and they dump out of people and i'm gonna guess uh entourage won something and i'm  gonna guess that uh the sopranos won something well yeah sopranos one only won one award though which  is good so well it was for what best series yeah but i mean didn't win a lot of best actor it didn't  didn't sweep it just won one no but a big one they won the big one jimmy as a gift yeah yeah all right  so the emmys were last night i mean if you want the rundown i'd go online who cares get a google 
[00:57:00]  alert really just google get a google google your emmys google emmy winners yeah and leave us alone  leave us alone because nothing really happens anymore the awards shows are the worst they were  they were such the rage a while back i used to love awards yeah like everybody talked about them uh days  before and watched them and then talked about them days after but now there's too many of them  they're they're all milk toasty nice there's no surprises left anymore even the mtv one was supposed 
[00:57:30]  to be the rebel one years ago and now it's just another piece of garbage uh well award show a bit  of controversy as far as the the vmas go that just happened a week ago yeah some of those uh live  performances weren't live oh yeah they did it days ahead of time see they're pulling the same crap  they really keep it safe keep it nice keep it expanding they're saying because of scheduling  conflicts but back in the day if there was a scheduling conflict uh joe schmo didn't get to 
[00:58:00]  perform oh well it was screw you yeah they would find somebody else that way you see some idiot like  chris novoselic throw a guitar up and crack himself on the head right right you're not gonna see that  anymore you get those fine moments but so whatever and the lip syncing is just stop it already can  anybody just sing their own crap apparently not oh it's so irritating capable of singing  so uh the big story though today is oj has officially been arrested for what i i still can't really figure 
[00:58:30]  out this what the hell he did this is so good and i don't even you couldn't even you couldn't have  expected this or planned it or if you would have said what would oj be arrested for next this would  be on the bottom of the list that i couldn't even believe it the first time i heard it i thought it  was a joke and then when i heard the uh the police got a call from a man in a hotel in vegas that said he 
[00:59:00]  had just been robbed at gunpoint and one of the people was oj simpson the cops must have just been  laughing going come on dude stop you were down at the tables you were drinking a little too much  what what are you watching tv and you think oj's in your room but no he uh apparently is a sports  memorabilia collector and uh reseller you know these guys they get sports memorabilia and they  sell it and this guy in the hotel room is one of these guys uh he had some oj stuff uh and some 
[00:59:30]  stuff that wasn't even oj related but it was football memorabilia all stuff that oj claims was his how it  was procured from oj to this guy is still a mystery so uh oj allegedly goes up with some thugs but he  just happens to be in vegas for a wedding he's a wedding he's the best man at a wedding yeah a 
[01:00:00]  wedding that's it uh that's that's real smart i was in chicago i mean vegas i cut my finger on  a poker chip who would ask oj to be their best man at a wedding stop in a second what a message  just send to your fiancee there it is yeah good point so oj and a gang of uh thugs uh go up to this  guy's room they gain entry somehow it didn't seem to be forced entry but uh they get in the room this 
[01:00:30]  is still all under investigation and alleged and uh at uh gunpoint is what this guy is saying he is  asked or told to pack up all the memorabilia exactly like it was and hand it over the guys  came in first with the guns and then the oj walked in behind him real cool you know like i got the gun  i got the guns on you and then they turn around and look here comes oj don't f with oj and oj was uh 
[01:01:00]  throwing out some expletives and um got the goods and then left and the guy called the cops how relieved  is that guy that oj came just to get his stuff just to get the stuff he didn't get the real mad oj  right he didn't get the and apparently this guy knows oj he's dealt with oj over the years so he kind  of knows him but uh now he's just really really pissed and and this now oj's been uh booked he's 
[01:01:30]  being held without bail because i believe they think he could be a flight risk based on where  that's performance where they get that idea yeah and uh i'll count he's like oh man this was my  chance at the spotlight again al al warm up the bronco i'll be ready in no time 
[01:02:00]  so he uh he's booked he's in jail and they're you know sorting out what to charge him with but  some of the charges look pretty uh you know assault with a deadly weapon robbery with a weapon i don't  believe he did it you don't believe he did he probably walked in and just got his stuff back  this is probably one of those scummy sports dealers that doesn't and probably had some oj memorabilia  that was taken but now they do have a couple of the other guys and the guns they have found these  guns and there's uh it's a casino hotel so there's surveillance tape up and down the hallways in the 
[01:02:30]  elevator so they're going through all that well we got audio from the actual robbery in the hotel  well yes we have that as well uh the possible charges robbery with use of a deadly weapon two counts  of assault with a deadly weapon conspiracy to commit robbery coercion and burglar burglary with a deadly  weapon damn you just been pwned yeah oh so uh oj has been arrested he's smiling all the way oh the 
[01:03:00]  guy cannot smile enough when he's cuffed uh oj in the can is the big headline here for the daily news  he's the happiest guy ever to be arrested oj in the can oj in the can and then i was just tapping  my foot but then you got news day going with oh jailed oh jailed they used a j for jailed oh jailed  so yeah and he's just smiling this would be my newest book if i did it see now i just go around 
[01:03:30]  committing crimes and then i write books like i didn't really do it it was charlie remember charlie  from the murder charlie bust in with the gun but if i would have i would have taken the elevator  up had two guys with guns walked in and and oj it was just like last friday yeah but i didn't do it  what were you doing iraq where's the what were you doing i was eating

[01:05:30]  is there really a rap song with oj yeah well he'll find the rap song we'll play that for  every raps when we get back because we are running late we got to do a little catch-up anyway audio  from the actual robbery in the hotel and uh oj just smiling and whistling if i only had a brain  as he's leaving the wedding out there in vegas waiting they didn't come at the wedding did they  no i don't think so no they had only arrested him what yesterday at the hotel 
[01:06:00]  one of the sometime yesterday we're staying at all right all on the way with opie and anthony  it's opie and anthony in the middle of talking about oj by the way  the on a virus spreading across america oh we had a missed call yesterday we love the the  missed calls we got a brand new one to add to the collection oh uh it was the jets game yesterday  this little play went down and then uh there was some confusion 
[01:06:30]  he's got it and down he goes at the five yard line  what's the call here now they're gonna say no he's out of bounds  now they're gonna say no he's out of bounds and then i'm gonna say it 
[01:07:00]  they never say i'm wrong no it's always someone else's problem  saying they screwed it all up wait what do they say you're the one saying it  what are they saying all right so oj's been arrested we're waiting for further info what what what  it's oj just handcuffed walking down the street on the news that's uh i know just smiling my knees 
[01:07:30]  hurt jimmy just shocked the hell out of me uh oj's 60 yes 60 years old the guy has barely aged since  94. well he's been you know i guess when you think you're going away forever for double murder  and then the next thing you know you're in a vague hotel room first class yeah second lease on life  yeah and look at who's fox's expert is old mark n-word firman good old mark gets some tv time 
[01:08:00]  today huh firman's back hey he got to help get uh skankle put away yeah one of the kennedy's  locked up wrote that right in that book about martha marxley yep good for him and he can't call  old pudding head johnny cochran either this time or uh cochran he had uh kardashian kardashian has  cancer died of cancer and esophagus cancer esophagus cancer his esophagus uh did him in and uh and  and then uh flea bailey was disbarred disbarred the dream team is uh gone so i don't know who 
[01:08:30]  oj's gonna get for this one but i think uh they haven't yet but once they levy these uh these charges  against him i think uh you'll start seeing maybe the race card being played a little bit you think  yeah goto i will see look at the look at the you ever see that the people that think oj was guilty of  murder and the people that didn't come on let's go over here yeah i think they're gonna start divvying  up again going come on this is this was a plot and a ploy to get oj uh they've been trying to get 
[01:09:00]  him for years and that's what they'll say this is gonna lead to nothing yeah it's gonna lead to  nothing did you guys see what fred goldman did with uh the book if i did it what since he's got  control of it now he made the if so freaking he used the smallest possible so it just says i did  it you look it just says i did it i mean it's like the if is like this small that's funny it's 
[01:09:30]  pretty much transparent it's like the least amount they i did it it just look there it is look at this  thing look what he turned if i did it it just says i did it oh that is good in big red letters  but the if is is hidden in the eye you see that that's where the if is now oh that's so you got  i did it in huge red letters now that fred goldman's uh it says by the golden the golden golden family 
[01:10:00]  by the way i've had enough of the outrage over this book i'm sick and tired of people who shouldn't be  pub hitler's books are published there's books on al-qaeda there's books on bin laden why shouldn't  this be put out i want to read it i want to read a why you included a couple of books in there that  well you know i had to because he's got a bad rep but you know it's like all of a sudden now people  are saying this shouldn't be it should be out how great is the if in the middle of the eye you can  barely see the if now it's just oj i did it and then it says with exclusive commentary he did it by 
[01:10:30]  the goldman family so they uh they write a little something something so it's a whole new thing  like with commentary oh yeah because i read the uh well we we read it on the air here yeah his uh  whole take on how the murder went down if he would have done what he said he didn't do but everyone  knows he did and uh we read it and uh charlie was there yeah charlie was his friend of his that he  hooked up with that saw the whole thing and uh actually was trying to calm oj down uh and oj just 
[01:11:00]  went wild and don't remember he doesn't remember what happened like he was standing there uh charlie  had the knife charlie had the knife and then the next thing he knew he was standing there with the  knife in his hand all bloody going what charlie what happened and charlie was like oh oj oh and then  they drove back to the house and charlie his imaginary friend charlie well oh i gotta read it 
[01:11:30]  with the goldman uh oh yeah they have a lot of lofts in there i'm definitely picking this up like  mystery science theater i'm sure just as many laughs i know i'm being insensitive because i like fred  goldman yeah and i don't comprehend the agony of having your summer i get all of course and having  a guy just walking around like being arrogant yeah i'm just getting tired of them and i shouldn't  be oh you're getting tired of the goldmans a little bit you're allowed a little bit it's been  it's been years and i know it's not my loved one i just as far as i was concerned ron my opinion was 
[01:12:00]  that he was banging nicole i think he was banging her and he was there and whatever i'm not might have  been which you know might have been i'm glad he hasn't let up god bless red goldman i know i agree  but he probably knows that the country's kind of getting tired of him but he doesn't give a crap he  he wants oj dead we're discussing that over the weekend again i i'm just waiting for the day that  fred goldman gets his the big c or something a diagnosis of a terminal disease and then he will  attempt to kill oj that will be oj's terminal disease too because when he realizes that his 
[01:12:30]  life is not worth living anymore i i have a strong feeling he's going to go after oj yeah  i really don't know if he just shot him so just get it over with he might you know you don't know  like but he probably thinks he's got you know his family to live for and everything now and then  uh maybe if he he gets a terminal disease he'll decide let me just end this whole saga  oj's pretty accessible yeah to a fred goldman well here's some oj uh audio i think he's leaving 
[01:13:00]  a wedding and there's reporters outside and he decided to kind of whistle uh if i had a brain  if i only had a brain this guy is awesome still all smiles okay can you tell us what happened  okay will you tell us what happens  if only had a brain you got married congratulations  who's the idiot reporter so this was are you is he whistling if i only had a brain someone's amazed in 
[01:13:30]  that clip like what when was this clip after the robbery uh had to be after the robbery that oh  yeah yeah and following and so the wedding was after the robbery yeah yeah he went to the uh wedding  okay so he flew into vegas for the wedding and then decided he needed to do a little armed robbery  while he was out there yeah i believe so okay i got to believe so the armed robbery happened on a 
[01:14:00]  friday whatever and the wedding was on a saturday and then the the reporters are now following him  and he decides he needs to do this still all smiles can you tell us what happened okay will you tell us  what happens i was thinking if only had a brain you got married you got married congratulations  that guy is a shock whistling if i only had a brain is he this stupid  i bet you they used oj's face to gain entry that's probably what his part in the robbery was 
[01:14:30]  it probably just used his face because the guy would look through the peephole and see it was him  and open the door and then the guys came in and whatever it's probably a memorabilia that was his or  yeah but he can't get it back with yeah you're not allowed to do that even if it was his but they're  saying it it wasn't his it's just out on the market he considers it his there's some things that are yours  and then they're not yours anymore but you sell them you you lose them but when i heard this i  thought he was getting his heisman trophies back uh trophies heisman trophy back or or some other 
[01:15:00]  stuff it was like autographed baseballs it was some it's like an autographed joe theisman lithograph  was it joe theisman or montana montana whatever exactly so you barely has been shinbone  like the memorabilia he went after is like who gives a crap it wasn't anything oh gee that's who gave  a crap wasn't that crazy here's the loot uh nfl hall of fame plaque worth about three to five  thousand dollars signed photo of oj with j edgar hoover righteous books j edgar hoover baseball 
[01:15:30]  signed by pete rose queen baseball signed by p rose and duke schneider uh the pete rose ball was worth  300 the duke schneider was worth 75 this is like who gives a crap stuff uh joe montana hall of fame  lithograph five hundred dollars footballs uh signed by simpson uh 200 to 500 couldn't he just  couldn't he just buy some footballs and sign them what the hell is that about and autographed 
[01:16:00]  photographs uh photographs of simpson he couldn't make and make more of those those were 200 to 700  dollars each so what's the big deal i mean if these are signed by oj i need them they oh wait a minute  i am oj five six i did quick math here the loot was worth about seven thousand dollars hey and now  he's locked up give or take a few hundred on either side for seven grand seven grand worth of crap and 
[01:16:30]  half that stuff he could have redid not good job uh here's audio of the actual uh robbery going down  kind of kind of hard to hear but you get you get to hear some key things in this  you think you can steal my yourself don't let nobody out of here  we gotta slow this down how is that recorded first of all joking i thought it was gonna be some  no this is real this isn't an oh and a bit this is the deal man how is that recorded i i can't say

[01:21:30]  buckle up what do you think they'll do though they can't up it's going to be an interesting  ride with the oj thing you know they want to throw him in jail for like life but these stupid  charges aren't going to be they'll be they'll be knocked down to some kind of simple  whatever that well i don't even know what they can knock it down to  i'm distracted because who is the the woman with the buxom bosom on large cans like wow i know

[01:24:30]  get on your knees get some of these easy transition like a sextant or an intuition so now it comes down  to just one decision i'll be going up the middle while you suckas be blessed to the 50-yard line  leaving all you behind then i can survive better hit your room watch out here just to show you all  i've been stuck with this mic as i was with the ball  welcome to the classic burger my name is melvin 
[01:25:00]  you didn't want those large fries you know what they're saying about bad foods making you bad  turn the camera  i like to make werewolf movies wow yeah i wonder if he cut ron goldman's throat because he wrote the

[01:26:00]  charge for that uh armed robbery or whatever i don't know if you guys heard anything about that or  they'll try to get them yeah i always hate when they say stuff like that i i don't pay attention  to that because it's never 35 years no and i i don't even think it'll be three years it'll probably  be some dumb probation thing in the end yeah they'll just whittle it down to nothing i don't know but  if it's an armed robbery right mandatory but he didn't have a gun on him doesn't matter if you know  he's yeah he's in there it's he's participating in an armed robbery yeah especially if he's uh doing 
[01:26:30]  all the yapping like that wow yeah give me my stuff have you ever read ezekiel 25 17  the path of the righteous man is by sect on all sides i love you honey bunny  just the murdering oj is fantastic mind if i have some of your tasty burger  is that a big kahuna burger guys just sitting there 
[01:27:00]  where's my sports memorabilia do i look like a bitch  oh finally geez i want my evan sports memorabilia now where is it  you're right mind if i wash this down with some of your tasted beverage 
[01:27:30]  where's the audio  play the audio oj with the song  one moment please one moment please great  so he just conjures up an image now by the way this audio is from tmz and uh tmz now does a tv  show so what they're doing is they gave you a little on the website and now they're saying  more on their tv show tonight smart very smart 
[01:28:00]  all right 
[01:28:30]  Alright, we'll take a break here  So Mike took it and OJ knew Mike took it  So they know who's Mike  Hey Mike, they're all in cahoots together  What do you say, Bill?  Paint each other up  Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas  And steal memorabilia from a murderer  Like OJ, like that  Like that  Let's say hi to Paul and Yonkers 
[01:29:00]  Paul, what's up?  I don't know if you guys think that OJ did it  Because he wants to get caught  You know like when people do stuff  Years ago that they killed before  Nah, he's just insane  No way, OJ is just kooky  He's kooky, wacky OJ  Armed robbery over stuff that's worth $7,000  And some of that stuff he could have got back  By just re-signing footballs and pictures  He's probably just really, really annoyed 
[01:29:30]  At having to  Like, he's got his pension  Which the Goldmans can't touch  And then every other penny he makes  Has to go to Ron Goldman  Ron Goldman's family  So that's got to really  Even though he killed them  Believe me  I don't  I'm not saying this is justified  He must feel like  Awful  That every penny he makes  Has to go to them  What's he make?  Like $300,000 a year on his pension?  Yeah, something like that  So he's making, you know, a tidy sum 
[01:30:00]  But OJ could be making millions  Millions upon millions of dollars  But he chooses not to  Because he doesn't want to give the Goldmans any money  Alright  So he does armed robberies  Allegedly  And hopes to make $7,000 here  $8,000 there  I'm a bank robber  That's what I do now  I'm OJ  Let's say hi to Chris in Houston  Chris, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey  I'm just wondering if we should call this Pulp Simpson 
[01:30:30]  Pulp Simpson?  Pulp Simpson  There you go  Well, here's the call that came into 911  I don't know you  Who is this?  Don't come here  I'm hanging up the phone  Prank caller, prank caller  See, they didn't believe it was OJ  Who would believe OJ is robbing a casino?  When I first heard that, too  I just thought  Well  Ocean's the 14 or whatever it is  But this  It's OJ  But Anthony, this clip gave him away  Right here  I am the werewolf  Why would you do that with all those cameras around? 
[01:31:00]  It's just stupid  He's  Yeah  He's not smart  I don't think he's smart  He's not good at, like, getting rid of evidence  Like, he did get off  But he did kind of leave a mess behind in 94  Right  And then here was just, like, the guys taping him  There's cameras all over  I was just in a room  I don't know what happened  Mr. Blonde went nuts  He was standing there  Bang  Bang  Bang  I mean, how old was that black girl?  20? 
[01:31:30]  See what movie you saw on the weekend  Ah  A little Tarantino fest  Yeah, sure  On the drive down  Nothing wrong with that  Yeah  Yeah  I love that one  Stupid OJ  Alright, phone number 877-212-ON-A  It's Opie and Anthony  It's Monday  Yuck 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony here  What else is going on in America?  Or what are we talking about in America?  Sort of talking about the plane crash in Thailand  But it's kind of far away  So we're not really that concerned  Oops  Killed 90 though, right?  Plane split in half  It's a bad thing for a plane to do when it lands  Yes  Yeah, a lot of  Gee, I wonder how many laptops are being confiscated  Out of the records  I know  Go through that  Why are you in Thailand? 
[01:32:30]  Why do you go there?  How's Oedipus?  Was he on the flight?  What about John and Jeff?  Are they alright?  John and Jeff  Is the porno stash going to dry up for the next few months now?  Are they going to be able to get some porn?  There are some kids in Thailand going  Right about now  Well, 90 people die  But maybe, I think hundreds of kids have been stayed  Yes  Thailand, who goes there?  Also, the tourists are flocking to the airport bathroom 
[01:33:00]  Where Larry Craig was arrested  Yeah, it's a tourist attraction now  How great is that?  How many guys are getting that picture taken with the door open?  Like tapping  Tapping your foot?  Look at me, look what I do now  Hey, I'm tapping my foot  Get some video in this  Disabled man killed by massive bee attack  I read this last night  This just sounds like something out of a horror movie  This guy, I guess, and his brother  Open up this garage door  And thousands of bees come flying out 
[01:33:30]  Were they inside going out or outside going in?  I read that too  I believe they were outside going into this garage  So the bees were nesting in there  Yeah, so they open up the garage door  And thousands of bees come out  So the one guy goes running to a neighbor's house to get help  The other guy uses a walker  So he can't move very quickly  So they get the cops and the fire department to come down  And when they arrived  They said the man was covered from head to toe in bees 
[01:34:00]  Just hanging on to his walker  And getting stung over a thousand times  Which subsequently led to his demise  And they chased the rescue workers  Yeah, yeah, they chased the rescue workers  They got, you know, the other guys in the ambulance  Well, they got the guy that got stung a thousand times  They put him in the ambulance  After they got the bees off of him  And the bees were like chasing the rescue workers  These bees just went crazy  One of the firefighters  He arrived on the scene to find a thick, dark cloud of bees 
[01:34:30]  Attacking the man  Bees  Those bees are nasty  I wonder if they were killer bees  Because most bees won't attack you like that  You know the killer bees are coming, Jimmy  Yeah, they're in New Orleans  Ever since 1980  75, I don't know  I always had a problem with the killer bees are coming  Because I thought to myself  Even as a little kid  I'm like, well  Well, they gotta be somewhere killing people already  So  Yeah, wouldn't we hear about it?  So why don't we get the news reports  On what the killer bees are doing at this very moment? 
[01:35:00]  It was some awful South American country  So we didn't hear the news  Well, they say they fly off a barge sometimes  Like that was one way that certain times  The bees may get somewhere  Is if they're traveling on a ship  It was a nest of them on a ship somehow  And then they get close to land somewhere  That's probably how they could do it  Without  Like, you know, the temperature here would kill them  The bees aren't gonna survive up here for long  It's too cold  Yeah, too seasonal  But  They go dormant when it gets cold  Yeah, they could slow down their bodies  They're like the blob  I would 
[01:35:30]  If I was standing there  And a swarm of bees came after me  I would drop dead  Right there on the spot  Well, look for water  I hate these  Look for a pool to jump in  Guy's got a walker  Where the hell's he going?  I don't know  Poor bastard  Gets me the heebie-jeebies  So  We're talking about that today  Also, Britney Spears might lose her kids  Whatever  Because of drugs  Well, she wants to flip around the orphan  K-Fan has 30% of custody  She has 70%  And she wants to reverse that 
[01:36:00]  He wants to reverse that  Really?  How does she feel?  She's offering him millions to drop the suit  Oh, okay  And finally  Barry Bonds  The record-breaking ball  Yeah  They said it would go for about a half mil  It went for $752,000  Who the hell bought it?  Anonymous?  Yeah, I don't know  But there you go  Can I tell you the two I was watching  You know how I talk about those  Those giant hornets in Japan  Those the biggest  Oh, yeah  You turned me on to those videos  They're horrible, horrible animals  But they're giant hornets  And they will kill you 
[01:36:30]  A few of them can kill you  Oh, yeah  And they attack beehives  And a bunch of them will kill 30,000 honeybees  But there's a video of a guy actually petting one  Because they don't really attack far from the nest  So this guy actually has one as a pet  What?  A pet?  Yeah, he has a pet  A pet  A giant hornet  And like they said  It's away from the nest  So it doesn't attack  They don't attack  When they're not  You know, I don't care  It's got a stinger on it  That's it  But the bee crawls out  It's on his hand 
[01:37:00]  And it's nibbling honey  Off his hand  Go to large hornet  On hand  Yeah, look  That's a  This guy's insane  He's tapping at it  Look at the size of that guy  Oh, God  The thing is coming out of its little hornet cage  He's got it in a little  He's got a  It's right by  Oh, look  His little claws are grabbing onto the finger  Oh, that's adorable  Pulling them out of the cage  Now the thing is on his finger  Look at the size of that bee  That is giant  That guy's insane 
[01:37:30]  Notice he's moving a little slow, though  Oh, you don't want to alarm it  Well, you sure don't  And now he's  Look at the size of that  It's almost as big as his thumb  As big as his thumb  Yeah, it's as long as his thumb is  And it's like  It's nibbling  Nibbling on honey that he put on his thumb  Do you know how fast I'd have to knock that off  It wouldn't even get close to me  I'd be swinging at it  There you go  I'd rather have a conventional pet  I have a cat, you know  You do? 
[01:38:00]  That Steve from Bayshore gave me  Really?  His name is Jack Jack  Off, off  Steve from Bayshore  Okay, terrific  I'd have to put that hornet on your cat's nose  No  Watch it panic  Little Jack Jack's little tender nose  It's pink  And it's wet  It would be fat and nicely stung  Because that hornet would continue stinging it  Because they don't 
[01:38:30]  They don't stop  No, sting away, pal  Mark Echo bought the baseball  Oh?  Yeah  Who's Mark Echo?  Echo  Are we supposed to know who Mark Echo is?  The guy hung up  Mark Echo  Hello, you  Sir  I think I  Yeah, we lost him  Alright  And this went down a couple days ago on Larry King  We can't get enough of Larry King  Especially when he just makes mistakes  Because he's a dottering old fool now  Yeah  And it's very hard for him to conduct interviews 
[01:39:00]  When he can't even remember who he's talking to  Well, he had an exclusive interview with Denise Simpson  Yes  Denise Simpson  Nicole's sister  But if it's Nicole's sister  Why is it Denise Simpson?  Hey, what is that?  That's a good question  So someone around here is messing up  Hey, what happened?  Denise Brown  It's Denise Brown  It's Denise Brown  Yeah, Larry King accidentally calls Denise Simpson  Nicole Simpson  Someone screwed up here  It would be Denise Brown  Denise Brown 
[01:39:30]  Larry King accidentally calls Denise Brown  The sister of Nicole Simpson  Yeah  Well, Larry called her Nicole Simpson  That's great  Here it is  This confession about how he killed Ron and Nicole  And he worked hard thinking that he was going to make millions off of it  And we snatched it right out from under him  Are you getting any money, Nicole, from this at all?  Denise, no  Denise, no  She goes real fast  Denise, no  Oh, for the love of God  You getting any money from this, Nicole? 
[01:40:00]  You money-hungry whore  Nicole?  Just put Anderson Cooper in there already  What are you waiting for, man?  We're taking a phone call now  Ron Goldman, you're on the phone  With Nicole Simpson  Hello?  Tune in tomorrow night  As we have JonBenet Ramsey  All grown up and still wearing her little cowboy hat  Larry's been in broadcasting 50 years 
[01:40:30]  He got to the big celebration  It's time to just retire, Larry  Nicole, how important was the knife to your virtual decapitation?  Was it important?  This confession about how he killed Ron and Nicole  And he worked hard thinking that he was going to make millions off of it  And we snatched it right out from under him  Are you getting any money, Nicole, from this at all?  Denise, no 
[01:41:00]  I'm not getting a dot  I'm sorry, Denise  Who's Denise?  I booked Nicole  Get my producer  Nicole, are you still dead?  What?  I've always questioned her motives  Who?  Denise  Why do you need the money in the afterlife?  Nicole?  Comment, question  Answer  Nicole, how am I talking to you without a Ouija board? 
[01:41:30]  A Ouija board?  Mike from Raleigh  Raleigh, whatever  Raleigh  Oh, and hey, hey, a-holes  I can't see the stupid hornet through the radio  Don't wait for your Marconi Award anytime soon  We're describing it, sir  We're describing it  That's why we said the size of a thumb, you idiot  And I think it has some value to a radio show  When you're talking about a video that we gave you the search for  Well, so, yeah, let me address Mr. Jackass here  It is 2007, idiot 
[01:42:00]  As far as getting a Marconi Award for radio  I think a show that uses all the technology that's out there  We use video conferencing here  We use the website  You ever hear of a website?  The World Wide Web  It was called the Information Superhighway  You at-a-touch douche  Do you understand that all of these things are now wrapped up into radio shows?  Go listen to a show that just goes on and babbles 
[01:42:30]  And has no interaction between their fans whatsoever  When we talk about something on this newfangled thing called the internet  We assume that people listening to the show have access to a computer  And can punch it up maybe later on or at work or something  If you're that out-of-touch ass, just leave the show  This isn't for you  We're doing stuff here that involves maybe some complicated infernal machines  That you don't have access to  Like that newfangled computer  Maybe we're stupid to assume that our listeners have an imagination 
[01:43:00]  So when you describe the hornet on someone's thumb  Licking little honey off the thumb  They could find  I didn't say it, I didn't say it  You kind of got close enough  Did I?  I think so  Once you pass you, it's over  It's pretty much the rule  Basically, we paint the pictures  You're visualizing at home  And everyone's okay  And then if they found that interesting  Then they use their computer  And they go look at the freaking video themselves  You dope  Yeah, the Marconi Award 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, Marconi, exactly  Because that's why we're broadcasting  We're hoping  Oh boy, I hope we get a Marconi Award someday  You don't get the show  Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish  Listen to whatever show you want  That you can just sit there  And they can talk about things  And not mention anything that you can see  On the internet  Or television  Or whatever  And why would we want the Marconi Award  When we have the prestigious Air Award?  Exactly  Mine got thrown in a fireplace 
[01:44:00]  I don't have it anymore  And I don't know where mine is  It's in a box somewhere  And then we made  We won the Air Personality of the Year Award  From Radio and Records  And it was a big record  Yes, it was  That you could display in your house  I don't know where that is either  We don't give a crap about awards, you dope  Alright, here's the  Listen to the rest of the book  Dummy  I love how Denise goes  Oh, that's okay, Larry  With a quick little laugh  This confession about how he killed  Ron and Nicole 
[01:44:30]  And he worked hard  Thinking that he was going to  Make millions off of it  And we snatched it right out  From under him  Are you getting any money, Nicole  From this at all?  Denise, no  I'm not getting a dime  I'm sorry, Denise  Forgive me  That's okay  I'm sorry, DeDot  This is the estate of Nicole  Dude, he said  He went to say  I'm sorry, DeCole  Listen  He says  He doesn't say Denise  He goes DeCole  Really?  He can't get it out of  Yeah  Really?  Oh, from this at all? 
[01:45:00]  Denise, no  I'm not getting a dime  I'm sorry, DeDot  Forgive me  That's okay  Okay, it was DeDot  DeDot  DeDot  The Aristocrats  DeDot  I just called you  Your dead sister's name  Wow  I hope CNN  You know, hangs on to him  For a few more years  Because it's getting fun now  It's really getting pathetic  I find myself  Taking a peek  At Larry King  Almost on a nightly basis  Because I'm waiting 
[01:45:30]  For these moments  Of him just screwing up  I'm sorry, DeDot  I'm sorry, DeDot  Ta-da  How are you still alive?  Mace, no  I'm not getting a dime  I'm sorry, DeDot  Forgive me  That's okay  DeDot  What does he say?  I'm sorry, DeDot  I'm sorry, DeDot  But DeDot  What does he say?  DeDot me?  Forgive me  Oh, but that's  I killed her  But I think instead of  Saying forgive  He says DeDot me  DeDot me  For DeDot  No, I'm not getting a Dodge 
[01:46:00]  I'm sorry, DeDot  Forgive me  That's okay  DeDot, forgive me  DeDot, forgive me  Ta-da  What a da-douche  Yeah, there's Larry messing up  And then we were talking about  The Emmys earlier  JFK in next week  Yeah?

Permanently brand the ball  With an asterisk  Before sending it to Cooperstown  But we were just  Discussing that off air  They would just  Rotate the ball  So you can't see the asterisk  Or  Put the ball  In a rocket ship  And launch it  Into space  Put it into outer space  Yeah  What would that do? 
[01:58:30]  I don't know  Online voting concludes  At 1159  Eastern Standard Time  On Tuesday  September 25th  Is the guy really  Going to do something?  Well let's all vote  For put it on a rocket ship  I want to see this guy  Have to put it on a rocket ship  That would be kind of cool  I guess you just get  Involved with NASA  And go hey  Can you throw this stupid thing  Put it in your shuttle  And have some guy  Just wing it out  Into space  I guess  Put him on that  Big robotic arm  So that's what he's doing  With the ball  That he just bought  For 752 
[01:59:00]  Thousand  Dollars  How cool would that be  If that's what you said  Oh no  Because it might come back  In the atmosphere  It would just burn up  Yeah  It would definitely burn up  What if you said  He wanted them to throw it  Away from the earth  Well if some guy's got a pitch  That could hit 25,000 miles an hour  No no not  Then it would  God  No even from space  See escape velocity Jim  Is 25,000 miles an hour  An object has to be propelled  Away from earth  At 25,000 miles an hour  To escape  Its gravitational pull  So if the guy threw it 
[01:59:30]  It would just come back  Eventually it would come back  Into the atmosphere  Yeah  So you'd have to send it  By throwing it  Probably the eventually  Would be really quick  Yeah it wouldn't  I don't think it would  What?  Stay in orbit that long  What?  A baseball  If you threw it  From a park?  No from the shuttle  Oh  From the space shuttle  So if you put it on a rocket ship  And you send it out  Did you say space shuttle?  Well you could do that  Put it on a rocket ship  And just send it out  Send it to the sun  Just let it burn up 
[02:00:00]  Send it to the moon  Let it crash on the moon  And just sit there  Did I hear you say space shuttle?  The shuttle  No because it is  Ringtone  Monday mania  So people want this  For a ringtone  Okay  Special endeavor  Special endeavor  There you go  Baseball  Special endeavor  There you go  There's your mania  Right there  Special endeavor  All right  So  Oh wait hold on 
[02:00:30]  Beth wants to say hi  Beth in the Bronx  Beth I hear you  Calling  Beth  Hey what's going on?  What's up Beth?  Beth  You guys are incredible  I love you to death  Thank you  Yeah  We're loved and adored  And listen to  Whoa  I'm still looking at her  I'm cracking her up  How long have you been listening?  Forever  And honestly  Ever  Like I  Beginning of time  You make my morning  I would get out and shoot people  If I didn't have you guys to listen to me  Well let's take a few days off 
[02:01:00]  You know what I hate about that?  I'm always into people  You say we make your morning  But what is it about the show  That makes your morning?  Hmm  Good question  Because I  You cracked  Click  She missed a few  Missed a few shows  Did ya?  Yeah  She must have  She was shooting people those days  When  All right  We have time to do one more thing here  Fifth graders shown porn by accident  Ooh  Aunt buys hookers for 12 year old boy 
[02:01:30]  Ah  ABC reports on early puberty  Puberty  I used to have a teacher that said  Like puberty  Yeah  And it was like  Like mature  Mature  When you start to mature  You will go through a phase called puberty  Yuck  Puberty  How long ago did you go through that?  I was scared of puberty  Puberty  I used to  Oh nevermind  Oh boy  No no  Now you got us  What you used to 
[02:02:00]  So what?  I was scared of what puberty was doing to my body  So let's  So would you pluck?  So let's just put it this way  I would make sure my body looked like it was before the puberty started  Oh my god  You didn't  You were fighting it the whole way  And  And I'm talking all areas  Did it shave under your arms?  I just  Wanted to still  Would it shave  Or would you pull them out as they grew in?  Shave  Wow  Did it shave under your arms? 
[02:02:30]  Ah  I would just make sure  I don't want to grow up  I want to be like Peter Pan  I wanted  At first I wanted to keep my body right where it was  Yeah  I didn't understand that puberty thing  Shaved under your arms though?  No I didn't say that  Oh  Honestly  No I said everywhere  Yeah  Oh meaning  I don't  Honestly I don't remember with the underarms thing  I don't remember  But other places  What about your legs? 
[02:03:00]  No no I didn't get like crazy  No  Cause like  Your legs start getting  Hairy as a kid  No I didn't get crazy  In that way  But elsewhere  Like chinny chin chin  And other places  I'm like  I just want my body how it was  Well I didn't  I was just scared  I didn't get hair on my chin  Till after I got my hair elsewhere  Well that's what I'm saying  Yeah  But I  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  I love shaving  That's sick  And then finally  It's really disturbing 
[02:03:30]  But finally then  I was you know  Ready for it  I'm like  You just accepted it  And then I let it go  And it's been grown ever since  Now it's just  Looks like Carrot Top  Wearing a prop nose  Hey  Why isn't she on our show today?  We had her on last time  And she was great for us  Our pal  Heather Graham  Why isn't she stopping by today?  Where's rolling?  She's very busy  Alright here we go 
[02:04:00]  So  Older girl  We'll do a little puberty  Before we get out of here  Girls  Reaching puberty  Earlier than ever before  One study found  Half of African American girls  And 15% of Caucasian girls  Are developing  Before the age of 8  And that is leading to  Some very real medical problems  Dr. Sandra Steingraber  Is the author of a new report  That tries to explain  Why this is all happening  Good morning doctor  Good morning  So are childhoods  Really being cut short here?  We're talking about  Puberty for girls 
[02:04:30]  At the age of 6  And 7 years old  That's happening?  Yeah  Well let me personalize that  When I was  11 and a half  My breasts first began to grow  And that was 1970  And that turns out  To be exactly average  When I took a look  Back in the data  In 1970  The average age  For breastfeeding  Of American girls  Was 11 and a half  Now it's age 10  So half of all  American girls  Begin to develop  Their breasts by age 10  But that's of all  What? 
[02:05:00]  There's a racial breakdown  And a huge difference  Like that  Where it's 50%  Of African American girls  And then 15%  Of Caucasian  What's the race  What does race  Have to do with it?  I want to know  What race  What?  Creep is doing this study  Yeah  That'd be a real goal  What's your birthday  Young lady?  Let me take a look  I'm a doctor  You're 8  Alright  Let me get out  My instruments  Let me start looking  I need to know 
[02:05:30]  Let me get my tape measure  I gotta get my pinchy  Instruments out  Whatever it's called  A micrometer  Yeah  And why do we think  That's happening?  I mean that's  Every parent's question  Why?  Why?  Well that's what I explore  In this new report  The Falling Age of Puberty  In U.S. Girls  And it turns out  That the part of the brain  The hypothalamus  That controls puberty  Responds to  A whole plethora  Of signals  Some of them  Come from the environment 
[02:06:00]  Some of them  Come from our diet  Some of them  Come from our activity levels  And our stress levels  So certainly  Childhood obesity  Is playing a big role  In the story  But so our exposure  To endocrine  Disrupting chemicals  Chemicals that actually  Are mimicking hormones  That are found  In some common  Consumer products  Such as plastics  And even in  Pesticides that we use  On some of our food  So this is also  Part of the story here  Wow  Hmm  Plastics and pesticides  Huh?  You were saying that  Before the break 
[02:06:30]  And the hormones  In the foods right?  Hormones  Johnny  Johnny's a little confused  O.P.U. Homo  Did you talk too?  I wasn't ready  For puberty  I wanted to ride  My stupid bike  For a little longer  That's what it comes down to  You say he wanted  To be a girl  Right  I didn't understand  I didn't really understand  What was going on  And I was like  Whoa  I need some time  To let this sink in  I want to ride  My little stupid bike  And buy baseball cards  For a while longer  For your brother  You're a bunch 
[02:07:00]  Of older brothers  They never explained  To you what the hell  Was going on  Oh  How could Elmo  He probably just applauded  They should have  Like my brother  Before anything  Happened to me  My brother  Was like  Oh yeah  Before you know it  This happens  And then that  And then  And then  You start  Banging  Were you psyched  For it though  Or did it scare you  At first  That's all I'm asking  I don't think  I was psyched  I was psyched for it  I kind of  I don't know  I kind of liked 
[02:07:30]  Being a kid  But  What are you gonna do  What was the option  I'm not gonna start shaving  Right  It was hard enough  Trying to get  Alone in the bathroom  For other things  Took a little while  Never mind shaving  I'm shaving mom  Oh my god  Would you freak out  I always loved the kids  That just started puberty  And they got like  Just a few  Like you know  Hairs on their chin  And they let them go  And they just look ridiculous  Just let them grow out  It looks ridiculous  Until you get  Until you can get  Some kind of patch going 
[02:08:00]  It's like  One here  One there  But they  Pluck it  And they let them go  Cause  I don't know why  I remember the first time  I smelled my own underarms  I was playing with my friend Frank  I was walking  I'm like  What is that stink  And it was me  I'm like  Oh  You're turning into a man  Boy becomes a man  Yeah  My mother yelled at me one day  That's how I found out  Cause one day  You're a kid  You can run around  You do whatever you want  And you're not gonna stink  And then  And then one day  My mother was like  Oh my god  You smell like chicken soup 
[02:08:30]  What's wrong with chicken soup  It's good if it's in chicken soup  It's not good if it's coming out  Of your armpits  Yeah  I was like  Oh  I was all embarrassed  Were you  Parents have a great way  Of embarrassing you  When you're growing up  It's like  You could have been  A little nicer about it  Did you use deodorant after that  Yeah  That next day  Or that moment  Yeah  It was just  You know  Washing up  And using deodorant  But back then  I didn't have a bunch of choices  I think I had to use  The old man's  Old spice  Or something 
[02:09:00]  Brute by Fabergé  Alright  Here's the rest of the  Puberty thing  The world is not  A happy place  For early maturing girls  As it turns out  Girls who  Go through puberty  Early are at high risk  For psychosocial problems  Such as  Anxiety and depression  And even violent  Victimization  No kidding  Ah well  That's true  We always tease this girl  Her name was Jerry  And she came in one year  After the summer was over  And man  Pow 
[02:09:30]  Wow  And this is in the 6th grade  Yeah  Just wham  Everything  All the features  She got taller  And got huge boobs  Nice shape  And as 6th grade boys  What do you do  You just laugh at her  And goof on her  Ha ha  Boobies  Look it's booby girl  You dummies  And then they have to  Walk around all ashamed  Trying to cover up  At all times  Should be hitting that  6th grade  Shouldn't be making fun of it  Could have been the guy  That was like all smooth  Going over to her  Saying it's cool  These guys are idiots 
[02:10:00]  But what do you know  In that  At 6th grade  Did you feel bad  When you saw her  Years later on  The facts of life  Ha ha  Jerry  I never felt bad for her  Because one time  When I was goofing  On her boobies  She kicked me right  In the groin  Ha ha  And put me right down  On the ground  Ha ha  That is really weird  That's stupid Jerry  If we knew what we knew now  You would have like  A field day with these girls  You'd have a harem  And the teachers  Because all your friends  Would rather be like homos  Yeah  Like it was cool to  Just hang out with your friends 
[02:10:30]  Playing chess  Yeah  When all this babbage was around you  There's girls around  All being made fun of  Because they're developing  Right  And you could be the guy  That's just like  You know the guy  But instead  You're doing skateboard tricks  With your pals  Your pals goofing on them  As they walk by  Right  Real smart kids  Goofing on how hot they are  Yeah  How dumb were we growing up  Very stupid  You know what I was just thinking  What  We could have easily done  15 minutes right there  I know 
[02:11:00]  We could have easily done  15 to 20 minutes  And look what happens  The music  Cuts off the show  The music  Oh well  Next time  Hey guys  Have a great day  If you're not joining us  Over at XM  Bye  The opiate anthony virus  Get infected  Ah  Ow 
[02:11:30]  Ow  Jimmy  Are you okay  He just slammed his head  On the microphone  He hit his head  I was putting my headphones on  And the headphones  Snap back  And hit my head  It snapped on ya  Oh I thought it was  I've hit the headphones  I mean  My head on the mic  Many times  No it just kind of  Snap back  I gotcha  Here we are  At XM Satellite Radio  Hi  We were laughing  Going how many  How many times  Do you think we can play  Ecstasy of Gold  In one morning  And get away with it  Without people just  Really getting angry 
[02:12:00]  We already play it twice  I'm thinking we can get  A third play out of it  You think three  I need to rule  By the way  We don't know  When we're going back  To XM  I want to go over there  And see the new studio  Yeah who wouldn't  What studio  Well we're supposed to go there  What September 4th  What day are we up to  The 17th  Dude  Yeah  We're two weeks past  The due date  Of our new studio  It's almost January  And take your time  Pick a date  Yeah winter's not going  To be here for at least 
[02:12:30]  Four or five more months  So just take your time  Because that's what's  Going to end up happening  No it's supposed to be June  No I know  Usually we'll come back  From suspension  But the guy will be on June  Yeah we were supposed to  Come back to a brand new studio  That's it  That's our fake suspension  That was before we left  For Philly right  Dude they  Alright the room was empty  They've just brought stuff in  Like tools and stuff  Let me see  I saw the place recently  This is from Wednesday  This is what I saw  Like a month ago  Yeah it's just  There's tools in it now  Whoa  In a ladder 
[02:13:00]  Actually it looks like  They took some of the stuff out  Since the last time I saw it  They've sold it  I'm not even kidding  Wow  I don't know  It's going to get interesting  I moved you  Stupid  You take awful pictures  What is this  It's a stadium  What's the matter with you  Oh  Alright who does this  You know how that works  I have the iPhone  I don't  Is he Stan  Stan  What  I called him Stan  Stan  You called him Stan  Sorry 
[02:13:30]  Did Kenny leave  Probably  He didn't give me an update  On my phone  What happened  Well Kenny  He knows I lost my cell phone  Yeah  In Atlantic City  My iPhone  And I gave him  All the pertinent information  That he was supposed to  Call this woman  Oh I think it's after 9  Well yeah  Call now  And get my phone back  It's got to be mailed to me  Immediately  I need it like next day  I'm missing all kinds of phone calls 
[02:14:00]  And important things  Did you just check your phone?  Text  Just call your number  I can't  I don't know how to do that  You don't even know  Your phone number  I bet you  I don't  No I do  Hey  Anyone else getting the feeling  That XM might let us go?  What  Give us the boot?  Yeah  If the merger goes through maybe  I'm being dead serious  Yeah I know  We don't really hear from anyone anymore  We don't know what goes on over there  Is Don around?  Could Don call us and tell us  What's going on with the studio?  Don on the phone  And I'm not trying to start  A silly rumor 
[02:14:30]  I know I'm good at that  But I'm seriously getting that feeling  These days  I don't think  There's less and less contact with them  Dude that's like  Do they feel like  They're getting the boot?  Dude  Like there's no business going on anymore  Calling Don about this though  Is like calling the guy that works  The french fry machine at McDonald's  About some kind of merger  Going through with McDonald's  I understand  Why would you call the french fry guy?  I used to be pretty close with Logan  I don't hear from him 
[02:15:00]  Logan's at least like the manager  Of one of the franchises  I don't hear from him much  We need Ray Kroc  He's dead  I think Logan is probably  He's preparing things  Resume possibly  Yeah  But he's getting a lot of stuff  I think they're just doing a lot of business  Over there with the justice department  It's a lot of government crap  Justice department  Here's my personal opinion  And this is only an opinion  This is not anything based on anything  Anyone's told me  Sell, sell, sell, sell  Speculation  Sell, sell, sell, sell 
[02:15:30]  By my own opinion  I believe  If the merger goes through  Which it does look like it might  Okay  And this is only based on  Whatever public information  That I have seen out there  Which means  Like the ex-head of the FCC endorsing it  Things like that  I think  Merger goes through  Mel Karmazin is the boss  They got that other guy over there  What's his name?  Scott Greenstein  Scott Greenstein 
[02:16:00]  Who kissed our ass back in the day  And told us that  We would be in a Hollywood movie  If we signed for Sirius  Signed with Sirius  Excuse me  Well  At any rate  Scott Greenstein  Remember that secret meeting  In the hotel?  Would be the Eric Logan  He's like the Logan guy  And you don't need redundancy  In this business  So Logan  Gone  Oh boy  That's where the problem starts  Wicklin  So gone  I believe  The head guy 
[02:16:30]  Nate  Gone  Because I know how  Karmazin works  Only his own people  Can't Logan  He knows Eric for years though  Logan's not a friend  He doesn't like him either  Who does?  He's still good at what he does  Logan left to go work for Fareed  And Mel doesn't like when you go away  To work for other people  Right  It takes that personally  If you fire him  And you work for someone else  Later on you might come back  Right  But if you leave  To work for someone else 
[02:17:00]  You've shown disloyalty  Right  So he doesn't hire you back  And doesn't like you  So I assume  That they'll just  You know  They want to feed Howard to everybody  Because that's his guy  We're  We would amount to  I don't know how  How it would amount to competition  But  I'll tell you one thing  And this is guaranteed  Through all kinds of  Things that happen  Contractual things  That I can't discuss  Believe me  We make more money  For XM 
[02:17:30]  Than any other channel  On their platform  By far  And  I would  Hazard to guess  More money than  Any other show on Sirius  Hands down  We're way more valuable  Than Howard  Making a lot more money  Way more valuable  For the company  Because they didn't get us  For a hundred million dollars a year  Yeah  Nowhere's near that  So we're way more valuable  Now if they can look at that  And say  Well these guys  Were bringing in some cash  That's one thing 
[02:18:00]  But if the personal stuff  Gets in the way of that  Or they have some other ideas  That don't quite  Jibe with what we want to do  Then there's going to be a problem  This is what might be  This is what  Because they might have  This is what I've heard  That they're pitching  To the FCC  Like one of the reasons  For the FCC to let it go  This is what I've read  You have to have like  Sirius's programming  And XM's programming  Like you can't screw people  Who just want to keep it  The way they have it  I don't think  Yeah  They may have one 70's channel  Or one 80's  Or one Sinatra  Or whatever  But I don't think 
[02:18:30]  That they could just  Or just throw this show out  Because what about people  Who don't want  Sirius programming  They would lose this show  And have nothing to replace it  Once the deal goes through  I don't know what I'm talking about  Then it's just a  Har har hearty  Har har on you  I understand  One of the arguments are  They don't want people  Getting screwed  They don't want people  That have XM let's say  And don't want anything  To do with Sirius  They want their service  To continue as it's been  That ain't gonna happen  Right  You're gonna get some channels  They get this  A la carte menu thing 
[02:19:00]  Where you can get  Certain amount of channels  For a certain price  That supposedly  Is gonna be lower  Than what you're paying now  And then you can choose  From other programming  Tiers  Like you do with  Cable television  You can get the basic cable  And just have basic channels  And they will have  Basic channels  Which will probably  Include things like  You know  The Decades  A rock channel  A classical music channel  Just things like that  And then you can  Add on  Other channels  Like  Our show 
[02:19:30]  And on  Sirius Howard's show  Things like that  And that's how  They'll work that out  So you think  This show will get  Screwed on the tier  On the plan  We're not gonna be  On a basic tier  I wouldn't  And again  This is just  My speculation  I can't see them  Going with that  That plan  And putting us  On a basic  Tier  Do you think  He would be  On a basic tier  No  They're gonna put  Us on  But not premium  Like last time 
[02:20:00]  Where you're paying  Full price  What it'll amount to  Is  You'll be able to  Get exactly  What you're getting now  And you'll have to  Pay  What you're paying now  But you can also  Get  The basic basic  For a lot cheaper  Than you're paying now  So you get the basic  You pay for us  A few other channels  And you wind up paying  What is it going for now  12.99  13 bucks  I haven't paid attention  In so long  I don't know  Well I have  Because I gotta pay  For my own goddamn  Subscriptions  Because I can never  Get through to anybody  To turn on my  My fucking radios 
[02:20:30]  Thank you  I have to  I send emails  Nothing gets turned on  I get frustrated  And my girlfriend's  Gotta get on the phone  And turn on  20 radios  That I pay for  For friends and relatives  So it's  Yeah like 13 bucks  Or something like that  So that'll get you  Pretty much what you're  Getting already  At XM  I don't see where  The savings is  For the company  This one singular entity  If they still have to  Keep all the switches  And lights turned on  On two buildings  Two receiver 
[02:21:00]  And transmission centers  Satellites orbiting  The planet  Units that only get  XM  Units that only get  Serious  Where is this  Savings coming from  They're gonna have to  Start firing people  I guess  That do  The 70s channel  So then  Is the 70s channel  Gonna be 70s on XM  And 70s on Sirius  Is that gonna be  The same  Program  Yeah they said  The Mel did say  That they would get rid  Of straight redundancies  Yeah  So you turn on 
[02:21:30]  XM  It's just 70s channel  And it's gonna be  The same 70s  That's playing on Sirius  From the same decade  Yeah  That's what I would guess  That's where they would  Save their money  Sure I would think so  Okay  Well  That's my personal  Take on it  Whether we  Stay or not  I don't know  I don't hear from bosses  I don't see people anymore  See people  No one cares  Well we got back  From vacation  And got into  All that trouble  That was around 
[02:22:00]  April 30th I believe  Somewhere in there  Right  That's five months ago  I feel like we've been  In a holding pattern  Ever since  Five months  Like we don't do  The walk over anymore  Which brings a great  Energy to the show  And then we bring  The fans up to the studio  And there's just  A whole excitement  That goes along with that  We've been stuck  In the studio  For five months  Yep  Five straight months  Yeah  I think it's probably  Just the fact that  They're working on a merger  And I bet  People in Sirius  Are saying the same thing  Like we're doing nothing 
[02:22:30]  Oh the heads will roll  Over there too  Oh business has just  Basically  For the most part  Stopped  Come to a screeching halt  Maybe not stopped  But it's certainly not  What it was  A mere four or five months ago  Nothing's  Nothing's  Like getting done  Except this merger  That's what they're trying  That's why you don't see  New commercials  For  XM  Or Sirius  You don't see  Any of this  Talent buying  That was going on  I saw an XM commercial  Yesterday during the golf  Did you?  Yeah it was pretty good  Was it an old one  Or a new one?  No it was pretty good too  Yeah? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah it wasn't bad  Well fuck me  Yeah  What was it?  Alright  It was during the PGA  The Tiger Woods stuff  You know cause they got golf  Yeah  It wasn't just a logo  On a screen  No no no  It was the whole  Using that  You know that  Whatever they use  Those  They  The logo  But all of a sudden  It's like a tooth  Or hair  Oh I got it  Yeah yeah yeah  I've seen that one  Yeah so  But it's a new version of that  I saw yesterday  Or I saw it for the first time  And we were supposed to get an email  From someone  Way way way way way 
[02:23:30]  Way way way up  And that never happened  That was promised to us  Like five months ago  Easily  Easily  To put our minds at ease  He'll be emailing you  Very very shortly  Oh right yeah  Remember that?  I heard about that  So  Well  I don't know  I don't know  What's gonna happen  I can tell you this much  Our studio that we were supposed to have in June  You're right Jimmy  Then we were supposed to have September 4th  And let's be honest  We were supposed to have it way before June  Years ago  Years ago  And now September 4th has come and gone 
[02:24:00]  And now it's September 17th  And Steve today said  It's gonna be two weeks  Who the hell knows  Oh yeah  Ron and Fez are sick of where they are  Ron's been threatening to not do the show anymore  They have to do it from a closet  I don't blame them  Those poor bastards are in Frank's place  Which we laughed at  Because Frank's place used to be our studio 
[02:24:30]  And then we kind of kept pushing it and pushing it  Till it was in a closet  Right  It pretty much took a walk-in closet  And put a shitload of equipment in there  So now there's nothing  You can't do anything in there  Oh it's called High Standards now  We lost Frank's place to Sirius  Like with the licensing rights for his name  Are you kidding?  Yeah  So they pretty much play the same music  It's just called something different  High Standards  I wonder what title they'll keep 
[02:25:00]  I'm just calling it Frank's place  I call it shit  I don't care  Because it bores me  Shoo-be-do-be-doo  Yuck  I don't think there's any reason  How did we lose Frank's place?  There's such brilliant lyrics like that  You got to hold your horses  Yeah  I got to tell you  The whole momentum of the channel  Has just been fucked up  In the last four or five months  Yeah  Because it was exciting  It was cool to take a break from the walkover  It was cool to take a break from moving studios  But we miss that excitement now 
[02:25:30]  You know  We should have stopped what we're doing months ago  And went back to the walk  I like when just before nine o'clock  This place is like  You know  The pits at a NASCAR race  People are coming in  And just grabbing shit  And running out the door  With laptops and CDs  And all sorts of shit  We meet the fans on the street  And there's an energy there  And then we invite them up  The whole thing  And now it's just like  We're just sitting here  How about this  We're in a holding pattern  How about this too  Let's say 
[02:26:00]  Merger goes through  You got Sirius XM  One entity  Now Sirius  We know  Has been just taking  Huge amounts of cash  To get contracts and talent  And licensing  For things like the NFL  They have that  XM has Major League Baseball  Didn't pay as much  They kind of were smarter  About their  Business dealings in some ways  And got some things for cheaper  Could you see Major League Baseball 
[02:26:30]  Sitting there and going  Well  Now we're going to be played  On two different  What amounts to two different platforms  Even though they're one company  But  We're going to be played more  And the NFL is getting  A shitload more money  Than we're getting  Go fuck yourself  We're either pulling out  Because we didn't sign on  For this  Or  Start coughing up  Huge amounts of money  Which  Cuts into the whole  Reason to merge  Which is  Save money  What about  What about real money for us 
[02:27:00]  Look that  We barely  It's kind of what I was doing  Under the guise  Because of the NFL  And that  We rarely talk about money  On this show  But you know  Howard's making  100 million a year  And Mel said  He's worth every penny  If not more  And I know  We're more valuable  Than Howard  We're making more money  We're more valuable  Than Howard  That's how it works  Where's our payday  We don't get one  Where's our payday  We don't get it  I know  Because we've always been  We're not the buddies  We're the bastards  We're the assholes  Always have  It's annoying  Only getting half the money  He's getting 
[02:27:30]  Half  My  Jimmy  We're the assheads  So  I don't know  But we're waiting  It's just a lot of questions  That I have no idea  And Don's in a meeting  About  He's just  He's just a figurehead  Anyway  He's tapping his foot  On the bathroom floor  Right now  He's good at ordering  Stickers and stuff  So what are we going to get  From him today  How come we can't get  Eric Logan on the phone  Don's in a meeting  Says he will call back  I haven't  Logan sent me  A nice gift 
[02:28:00]  On my engagement  So  I know he's still alive  What did he send you  Some money  Bottle of wine  Really nice bottle of wine  Bottle of wine  And google directions  To a tree  Google directions  That's  Because he likes to  Drive drunk  And hit stuff  Wow  Wow  Did he wrap that  New car on  Allegedly  No  No  He better not wrap  That vet up  He's a good boy now  He's a good boy now  I just like  We've all had  Our episodes  And that one  Made me laugh  He's just a good 
[02:28:30]  He's a good boy now  Elo  Eric is a  Elo is a sot  You know who you are  Elo  You're a sotabite  A sot  A sot  You know  Lot's wife  I believe  Or Noah  Was punished for drunkenness  Drunkenness  Well here's  What I want to know  When are we going to  Find out about the merger  So then maybe  The companies  Could start really  Working on their  Business again  Early December  Yeah  It's going to be  Before the year's over 
[02:29:00]  Early December  I heard late September  I heard late September  We would at least find  Know which way  This is going to go  ASAP  People in the  Justice Department  And I talk a lot  And they've indicated  To me  They said  Jimbo  Just sit tight  Alright  I read that in the paper  I don't know  So we're not moving  Into the new studio  Anytime soon  Anyone have any info  On that  Uh no  Well I think the building  Has made it harder too  Like I do believe that  Because the building 
[02:29:30]  Hates us  So guys show up  To do stuff  And those cocksuckers  In the building  Don't let them in  Well they won't let them  Use the freight out elevator  Yeah that guy said  That mousy guy  With the fucking glasses  I want to like  Open the elevator door  And just put his fat  Fucking pederast face in it  And then watch the elevator  Sever his head  And then laugh  Then they won't be able  To use the elevator  Because it would be  A police investigation  Yeah  Why there's a fucking  Severed head of a pederast  Pederast  Pederast  By the way  Can someone tell  Morgan Freeman  You're 70  Take the fucking earring out  It looks ridiculous 
[02:30:00]  Morgan can do  Whatever he wants  We get it  Another fucking  Shitty narration  Yeah  With his low key speech  Why he's doing  More narration  I don't know  I just wanted to  Assault him  Even though I like him  That stupid earring  Him and Ed Bradley  Even though  Rest his soul  Ed Bradley  Was a great journalist  But that fucking earring  Should have been removed  With a fucking  Zim-zam pedal  Poor Ed Bradley  Ed Bradley's  Dead right  He said that  Rest his soul  He was a great journalist  But that earring  Was just 
[02:30:30]  What are you doing  Idiot  What are you fucking doing  I think he went to  I think he went to the famous  Sting lute performance  Did he  Oh yeah  I got a picture with him there  Yeah we met  Ed Bradley  And he looked  Very healthy  And then all of a sudden  You hear that he had  Cancer  And he went  Well you know  God needed a journalist  That old gag  God needed someone  To jot down  And do the evening news  Shot  Did God need a sleepy kid  As well  You're commenting on the 
[02:31:00]  Oh wait  Little Portugal girl  There you go  Thank you  Oh Jesus  We don't know  That she's  Oh that case  Is wrapped up  My friend  Oh I think  They both are in on it  They're saying  They're both in  On those shenanigans  They're both doctors  They're saying  She may have died  Of too many sleeping pills  Drug overdose  An OD of sleeping pills  Because the parents  Wanted to go  And have a little party  They're on vacation  They found the woman's diary 
[02:31:30]  She's complaining  That the kid  Is too rambunctious  And having problems  Sleeping  Things like that  They wanted to go out  The kid probably was  Having a temper tantrum  They're both doctors  They give the kid  A few  You know  Drugs  Help her sleep  And she vomited  Apparently on things  And died  They put her in a trunk  And ditched her somewhere  I don't believe that  I think that they  Probably gave the kids  Little things to help them sleep  Which is probably they did 
[02:32:00]  And that's why the kids  Slept through the abduction  Because somebody did see  Somebody walking away  With a blanket  With a kid in it  Like one of the friends  Of the family  Probably the father  I don't think they killed it  I think the Portuguese police  Have bungled it  And they even said  They fucked up  And there's people  That disagree  In the police department  With what they're saying  I don't believe it at all  I don't think they killed their kid  I don't know  I didn't think OJ robbed that place  And a minute later  Obi played audio  So I really don't know anything  Of course OJ robbed that place  I don't know anything  It was Charlie took the kid  Right 
[02:32:30]  Alright  We're gonna clean up  A little bit today  Clean up  This is the  I'm too tired  I'm not mopping  What  I thought you meant  Cleaning up  What happened  I don't do windows  Smiley faces on windows  Are typical  At an elementary school  But what happened  Inside the classroom here  Is not  And it makes me sick  It makes me sick  School officials say  Some 5th graders  Saw about 15 seconds  Of pornographic images  Instead of what  The teacher intended  Well today  There was a class 
[02:33:00]  That was intending  To listen to  The theme from Star Wars  And unfortunately  A surprise occurred  Somewhere in a galaxy  A long way away  A cunt was open  And ping pong balls  Fell out of it  Come on  Tell us what the image is  We need to know  You know it had to be  Something just horrific  Luke  I am your sloppy  Party bottom  Luke  Your lightsaber  Smells like  Fish and liverwurst 
[02:33:30]  Princess Leia  You fool  Wash that pussy  That's not Chewbacca  It's like Chewbacca  Is that chewy  No I'm having my ass  Heaten  Oh I thought  That was chewy  The school sent  Letters home to parents  To let them know  What had happened  They say they're stunned 
[02:34:00]  I mean you send  Your child to school  To learn  For something like that  To happen  So I gave the man  UPS  The UPS  Here's part of the movie  This is a giant cock  Thank you  And of course parents are stunned  What parents are you going to hear  Like they were showing  Some Star Wars stuff  To your 5th grader  And a big cock  Came across the screen  And the parents are going to go  As expected  This is a giant cock  Fantastic 
[02:34:30]  Chris Cox  From LA  Cox  He works for  XM Channel 81  Oh my god  I think  Isn't Channel 81  I like to move it  Move it  I like to move it  Move it  Can we get a little taste  Of 81  Alright  What is it called  It's called like  BPM or something like that  Yeah  Hold on  What is it  BPM beats per minute  So I think  Yeah so it's that whole  Ah bop bop bop bop bop 
[02:35:00]  Ah bop bop bop bop  Wow  Do you know  I hate that music  My girlfriend said  I was such a faggot  Because I like that song  By Snap  I've got the pow  I used to like that  And she's like  Oh  Oh  Oh yeah  You didn't like  I thought that was cool  Back in the day  I actually  I actually like that  I'm a sucker  I'm a sucker  For some of that stuff  So Chris writes  You're a sucker  For that stuff  Alright  You like it 
[02:35:30]  You like it  Chris writes  When I was young  My father told me that  Pretty girls don't poop  How about that  Can we get a taste  Of what's on 81 right now  They just burp  And shit falls out of their mouth  Into a baggie  That's what his father told him  Oh  Chris is writing back  He goes  Yes  I bring the buttery beats  Oh buttery beats  To the XM Nation  Are you a DJ Chris or what  I don't know  Do they have DJs on that channel  How do you ever get in  To say anything  It's the same song  For a 20 hour straight  You can't even tell 
[02:36:00]  One song leads right into another  What had happened  They say they're stunned  I mean  You send your child  To school to learn  For something like that  To happen  Then  That's the problem  I'm just  Dumbfounded  That could actually  Get into the school  The school suspects  The porn came from  A school issued laptop  Not the DVD  The teacher put  Into the machine  One parent says  That's obvious  And apparently  Someone has been  Using the school laptop  For their personal use  It's not clear what 
[02:36:30]  If anything  Might happen  To the music teacher  The music teacher  What  They didn't even  Even hint  As to what it was  It was probably  Something  Was it just  A naked lady  Was it  A video  Was it  A still picture  Probably gaping  Gaping  That's a big thing  Now in porn  Where you fucking ass  Then you pull back  And the ass is like  It's like a mid yawn  It's yawning  It's fucking awful  It's yawning  It's a yawning asshole 
[02:37:00]  It's not used to like  Being like  Just stopped  And mid fuck  Yeah  Nothing worse  Than that gaping shit  Porn down  Takes a while  To close back up  Of course it does  It's been violated  The assholes are supposed  To open  With a tapered  Little thing coming out  Not with a fucking  Helmeted wrecking machine  Fuck it  And they pull out  Real quick  They trick the asshole  Just when the asshole  Adapts  And becomes loose  Like a  Like a nice sleeve  Like a pink  Grippy sleeve  They fucking 
[02:37:30]  Yank the cock out  And the asshole's like  Doesn't know what to do  Yeah  All those muscles  Have to contract  It's still yawning  We move slowly  It's like old curly mouth  It goes like  Well this is coming in  From Derek from Detroit  Chris Cox's show  On BPM  Is called  12 Inches of Cox  Oh  Nice title  So we got a song  A little taste  Of what you can find  On BPM  Channel 81  Here it is  What's the song called 
[02:38:00]  Oh boy  Don't worry  It'll kick in  I'm sure  It's Eurotechno  And weird shit  There you go  Oh my god  This is all they do  Amyl Nitrate  And man on man  Ass sex  This is  That's what this song's about  This is the song  Of the ass cave  Dude  Every song  Sounds like this 
[02:38:30]  I've got the skill  To request me  I've been here  For five years  Oh my fans are  Talking to me  I know you can't make it right  I'm still waiting  Oh you like that 
[02:39:00]  Don't you  Faggot  I wish I knew  I had to quit you  What the hell  Is with that voice  Oh here's Chris Cox  Hey Chris  Hey good morning boys  Chris Cox everyone  Welcome to the  O.B. and Anthony show  I've been seeing your  Feedbacks for a while now  So do you do a show  For 81  Or do you just  Kind of play the music 
[02:39:30]  For about two years now  I'm on Saturday nights  And I do  A mix show  Which I'm just like  You know  So it's just music  But I'm actually  Going to start hosting it  In about a week or so  All right  A mix show  I'm not going to lie to you  Man  Every once in a while  Well you keep talking  I don't blame you  Because I haven't been able  To talk on your show yet  Go ahead  It's your show  It's got to get a word  In edgewise  Right  Go ahead Chris  I'm just nervous 
[02:40:00]  Because I'm on the radio  No I'm just  I'm a huge fan of the show  I was about to say  Like that's it  I first was a huge fan  Of Little Jimmy's stand up  And then somebody  Turned me on to  I was never even  Listening to 202  And then somebody's like  Hey that comedian you like  Is on the show  And you got to hear it  And for about two years now  I have not gotten  Any work done  Because I'm always listening  To your fucking show  So  Well you don't need  To get any work done  You play the same song  For 20 straight hours  Yeah I know  It makes my job 
[02:40:30]  So much easier  It's great  You put something on loop  You can go hang out  In the club for a while  And you don't have to  Worry about anything  It's great  No one would even notice  What I was trying to say  Every once in a while  If I'm on a long road trip  I'll go through the XM dial  Song by song  I'll start with the  Stupid 40's channel  And go all the way  To the end  And when you get to  That weird area  In the 80's  Because there's  Three or four  Of those type stations  It's the same  Fucking song  Over and over again  I'll be honest  There's times  When I can't even 
[02:41:00]  Listen to my own station  So  I'm with you there  Because they're all  Remixed  All right  How about we do this  Ira  Could you find all these songs  This is their list  This is their  What  This is their top 10 list  Yeah this is everything  That they're running  On their channel right now  They're top 40  Oh top 40  All right start with  Number 10  Watch how they all sound  Pretty fucking similar  Let's go to number 10  Because they all have  And they make weird names  For their mixes  Like the Space Cowboy mix  The Tiesto mix 
[02:41:30]  The  Well those are usually  Like names of the DJs  Or names of the producer  That actually did them  Right right  Yeah  All right  Go ahead  You could say  The same thing  About the blues channel  Listen to the blues channel  And just about everything  Is going to sound  The same  I agree with him  Certain parameters  Of the genre  Right  Well this  I mean there's  If you're dialed  Into that sound  And into that scene  You can tell the difference  But yeah  If you're just  Kind of jumping in  From a real  Like rudimentary level 
[02:42:00]  Then yeah  It's all going to sound  Pretty much in the same area  All right  Here's an artist  Called what  Ed New  I guess  And this song is called  Put Em Up  Go  They kick in right  I know  They all start off  A little slow  And then they have  To kick in somewhere  And  Go  Just sweaty  Sweaty men 
[02:42:30]  They all have  The same  M.O.  With an H.O.  In front of them  Yeah  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  All right  Go to the next one  Go ahead and decide  Which one is  A good one of these  Now Fergie  You know  Very popular  With the  Of course  With pop music  Right  Fergie  But this is the  Space Cowboy mix  Of Glamorous  Starts down 
[02:43:00]  A little beat  And then  It'll kick in  And the bottom end  Kicks in  Usually about  10 or 15 seconds  All the time  How do you not get  Deep dicked  Enjoying this  I almost feel  My asshole  Almost feels empty  Somebody fill it  Quickly  All right  Go to the next one  Miguel Migs  I guess  Miguel Migs  So far 
[02:43:30]  The Rasmus  I threw cum in your hair  I hear  Yeah someone's saying  A little more of a Latin beat  Someone's saying  Is this the night  At the Roxbury soundtrack  Exactly  Here we go  And kick in  And  Here it comes  Here it comes  At the end of this little  What  That was unexpected  I gotta give him that  Does this kick in 
[02:44:00]  Any further  Oh boy  It's fucked  He doesn't know this song  Great  It's on your top 40  It's on your  And it's the top 10  Oh  All right  Go to the next one  Leonid  Rudenko  F  Daniella  That sounds like one  A song called  Summer Fish  All right  Here we go  XM 81  The soundtrack  Of a deep dicky  This is 
[02:44:30]  Summer Fish  Summer Fish  You love this song  How can you tell  You know  If you've been  If you've been on like  Your third day in a row  And you're waking up  On the beach  I thought he was gonna say  If you've been on your  Hands and knees  You've been on your  Third dick in a row  You've been looking the stalls  For a bit  You know  The soundtrack  This is Larry Craig's  Soundtrack  All right

[02:52:30]  When you're in a club, you'll get into us a little bit.  When we were out in Vegas, they were playing this shit at our little party we had out there during CES.  I'm talking about on the radio as you drive around.  It's fucking weird, man.  Last time I went to a club was many, many years ago.  And I told you, that's when I used to iron my pants where there was like a fucking pleat in the front.  Oh, you'd have to get the crease all tight.  And I was doing my dance and I thought guys were checking my moves out.  But I was just laughing at me, I think.  Oh, no, don't, no, no, no, Jimmy. 
[02:53:00]  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I was dancing.  Can I see some of these moves?  No, I don't remember what it was.  No, you do remember.  If we play some of that music, could you just do a couple?  No, no, no.  Was it like hip-hop-like?  No, no, no, no.  It was some move I did with my leg.  What was it?  I don't remember.  Show me sitting down so it's not as bad.  No, I'll do it.  Was it like this?  Was it like...  No, no, no.  I would like lift my leg.  Yeah, and then twist it like that way in.  Like this?  Yeah, kind of.  I don't remember. 
[02:53:30]  It was awful.  But I thought guys were checking your moves out.  Checking your moves out?  Dude, people are dying over the diarrhea noises, so we might have to play another one.  Let's try Fast Cars by Hellbent.  That's coming in like crazy.  Danny in Canada, real fast.  Danny, what's up?  Danny.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to tell you guys that if you want to enjoy this music,  you've got to pop about 10 pills of ecstasy.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, ecstasy helps.  But for the most part, you're in your car bopping to this shit.  It's a different atmosphere. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, you're not listening.  They don't play you.  You're not in a club with some girl sucking on a lollipop rubbing up against you.  You don't want to be the old guy at the club.  Let's hear Fast Cars by Hellbent.  It's going to follow the same formula.  It has a little beat.  Yeah.  This got a little aggressive early, though.  But I still think it kicks in.  Oh, Knight Rider.  There it is. 
[02:54:30]  I still say it kicks in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There it is.  There it is.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oos, oos, oos. 
[02:55:00]  Oos.  Glow stick Monday, baby.  Oos.  Oos, oos, oos.  Where are the glow sticks at?  We got one on PalTalk.  Deliver us from Eve, she knows.  Oh, she's got a glow stick.  Oh, yeah, she's glow sticking.  I've got to see that. 
[02:55:30]  Oos, oos, oos, oos, oos.  Oh, my God.  Oos, oos, oos, oos.  Oos, oos, oos, oos. 
[02:56:00]  Oos, oos, oos, oos.  Steven S. from Bayshore, top sheet of silence in his office, 
[02:56:30]  just loosening his tie and getting down.  Great. 
[02:57:00]  Oosh.  Grandmaster Anthony.  Grandmaster Anthony.  It just proves anyone can make this shit.  I'm telling you, man.  If you can make that sound so good using three stupid sound effects off the cuff,  anyone can do this shit.  I love it.  He's got a really good little connection with Jimmy there.  I've got a nice little Ozzy connection.  Always still talking.  What?  Ooh.  I actually produced the number one single for Ozzy's lovely daughter, Kelly. 
[02:57:30]  What was her single that was number one?  One Word.  It was number one for three weeks on the Billboard dance charts, like, a year, two years ago.  You produced it.  Yeah, yeah.  I produced it, yeah.  What was it called?  One Word?  Yeah, One Word.  Oh, cool, man.  Yeah.  So did we get to meet Ozzy?  Oh, we have another song ready to go here.
