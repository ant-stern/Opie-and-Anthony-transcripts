<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show began with the hosts complaining about the freezing studio temperature and a malfunctioning coffee machine.  They then interviewed Brother Joe, the frontman of a U2 tribute band, who recounted hilarious tales from their recent sold-out Mexican gigs, including their promoter's kidnapping and subsequent murder.  The conversation also covered the band's upcoming shows and international touring plans.

The main focus of the broadcast, however, shifted to a shocking incident caught on the office webcam. Opie described remotely accessing the webcam to witness several employees, including Danny and Derek, engaging in drunken, sexually explicit acts, including the exposure of their genitals and buttocks.  Danny's mother was also present and participated, with Danny holding up offensive and sexually suggestive signs about her.  The hosts graphically detailed the video footage and the ensuing struggle for webcam control between Opie at home and the office employees. Numerous listener calls followed, reacting to this explicit story.

The show then briefly discussed Osama bin Laden's declining influence, comparing him to the Iranian president, whose actions were described as being dictated by an 11th-century boy living in a well, including a desire to destroy Israel.  The hosts then delved into a discussion about violent interpretations of the Quran and a cartoon allegedly inciting violence.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured an interview with G. Gordon Liddy, along with his son Jim Liddy (a former Navy SEAL).  G. Gordon Liddy discussed his involvement in clandestine operations, including Watergate and Project Jennifer.  He shared anecdotes about prison, his *Fear Factor* appearance, and his current pursuits.  Both Liddy's discussed terrorism and preparedness, focusing on the vulnerability of ports to attack and emphasizing family preparedness plans for various types of attacks.  Jim Liddy's discussion of his career remained vague due to classified information.  The conversation also touched upon G. Gordon Liddy's lingering Watergate secrets.

Following the Liddy interview, the hosts discussed a newspaper article misrepresenting a statement by Anthony and featuring a photo of Jim Norton.  The article's author called in to clarify misunderstandings.

The show continued with a discussion of Jim Norton's comedic style, a news story about "Club Soda Kenny," a police officer facing disciplinary action for his offensive stand-up routine (including jokes about bestiality, pedophilia, and assault), and listener calls regarding Kenny and the Olympics (specifically curling).  An interview with Damien Fahey from MTV's TRL followed, touching on his experiences interviewing celebrities.  Joey Paisano, a restaurant owner and actor in *The Bunker*, was in the studio.

Later segments included conversations about a radio personality's encounters with young women at work, ethics in dating one's audience, and a discussion about a supposed "gay music" category on AOL.  A caller fell asleep on hold, prompting humorous commentary.  A mistaken call from Joey Paisano's restaurant led to a discussion about his movie, with the blind director, Joe Monks, calling in.  Fred Willard called to promote *Date Movie*, discussing his career and interactions with Jim Norton, who was also in the studio.  The hosts also discussed an ongoing feud with Scott Farrell and listener pranks targeting Farrell's show. Guests in studio during these segments included Joey Paisano, Jim Norton, and Damien Fahey.

The show concluded with a discussion of the previous night's broadcast, promoting an upcoming Paltalk karaoke session with "Dugout Doug," thanking Joey Paisano, and mentioning G. Gordon Liddy's book and Damien Fahey.  A caller, Chris, was on hold from Japan.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my sweet jeez.  With a...  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it looks so like...  Oh, it's hawk-a-tosis.  Oh, it's hawk-a-tosis.  All right, you're not gonna cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can. 
[00:04:00]  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. 
[00:04:30]  At no point were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.  Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.  What are you, a fucking moron? 
[00:05:00]  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  What?  What?  Come on, everybody!  Wake up!  Rise and shine!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  Good morning, pests.  Good morning.  Good morning to ya.  Make no mistake, this is a virus.  The ONA virus.  Spreading across America.  Yes.  Thank God it can't live in here under such frigid conditions.  Holy shit.  Like, why do we have to ask over and over and over and over again every day for the basic shit to do a radio show? 
[00:06:00]  It's every day.  Don, Wicklin, we are freezing.  We are freezing every fucking morning.  We have said this on the radio many, many, many times.  Anthony is sitting here in a ski jacket.  I'm in a parka.  And there's a granite, we have a big granite console thing here. 
[00:06:30]  You can't even touch it.  No.  It's so cold.  It's like a tomb.  Don, please.  You're doing a much better job lately, but please.  This is a problem.  Fix it.  How many times do we have to say it's a problem before it's completely fixed?  Get space heaters.  I don't give a shit.  If the building doesn't want to turn on heat until 9 o'clock in the morning, then let's get some space heaters or something in here.  This isn't just heat not being turned on.  This is air conditioning. 
[00:07:00]  Cold air being blown into this room right here.  The equipment alone would heat this place up enough where you could walk in and be warm.  There is cold air blowing out of the air conditioner.  Little Jimmy has to eat his kashi so fast or it will freeze.  His spoon will freeze in the milk.  Yeah, when the milk spills off, it actually freezes like water does when it's dripping off a gutter.  Yes.  It's cold.  What is that, Hawk?  What is that?  Space heater.  What is that, 1BTU?  I know.  I know you mean well.  What the fuck is that thing?  You actually have to insert that into your anus for it to warm up. 
[00:07:30]  It'll warm up my thumb.  That's about it.  That is the smallest space heater I've ever seen in my life.  And another thing.  We have a Starbucks machine.  Starbucks coffee is terrific.  Right.  But I bailed on the Starbucks coffee about a month ago.  What happened?  And what do I ask every morning, Anthony?  Every morning.  For Starbucks?  I ask if we can clean the Starbucks machine.  It's got to be clean?  Every morning.  Ben, is the Starbucks machine clean? 
[00:08:00]  Ben, can you find out if we can clean the Starbucks machine?  Ben, is the Starbucks machine clean?  No.  Ben, have you talked to Bruce about cleaning the Starbucks machine?  Ben, no.  Can someone clean the Starbucks machine?  Please.  And please, please, please.  This stuff is over and over and over again.  The simplest things.  Yeah.  We just want coffee that tastes good from the Starbucks machine.  And we want a studio that's heated nicely. 
[00:08:30]  That's all.  We'll do the rest.  We'll do the heavy lifting.  No problem.  We'll do it on a daily basis.  We'll have a fine show whether we're, you know, sitting and freezing with dirty coffee.  Or if we're in the middle of the Caribbean.  We don't give a shit.  Right.  We'll do the heavy lifting.  But we need people to help us out with the little things that make us happy.  Just the simple things.  Well, what is that?  The heater.  Is that the space heater?  Well, the place should be warm by 2 o'clock. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, that should be warm by June.  No kidding.  It's making a sound like, you ever watch those submarine movies when a destroyer goes overhead  and you hear the chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung.  That's the sound it's making.  Not too distracting.  No.  But at least we'll be warm.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  Brother Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  You guys wanted to stay warm.  You should have been down in Monterey, Mexico.  We just got back from there two days ago.  It's nice and hot, but everything smells like poop. 
[00:09:30]  Okay.  Wait, you're in Mexico.  Yeah.  He's traveling to Mexico now?  The 2U tribute band to U2 is traveling around the world, Opie.  We are global.  They just got back from Mexico?  Where were you in Mexico?  In one week.  We were there twice in one week.  We actually played last Sunday in Monterey, a place called Uma Bar.  It was 2,000 people pre-sold and sold out.  They think they're really seeing U2, these people. 
[00:10:00]  The Mexicans, they don't know what they're talking about.  Mexico was fucking ridiculous.  These people not only treated us like U2, but they did.  They acted as if they were standing in the presence of Mano.  How hysterical is that?  Fucking Mexicans.  It's funny, man.  It's funny as hell.  But you know what?  They bought 2,000 tickets at 150 pesos a ticket, which is roughly 15 bucks.  Those pesos, man. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Really devalued.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty horrific, man.  Did you get paid in pesos?  Actually, yes.  And I had to transfer the funds at the airport.  How many pesos do you get?  What is it?  Did they give you like 1,000 pesos?  Huh?  Yeah.  Oh, it was tens of thousands of pesos.  Get rid of the peso.  Call it something else.  Get rid of the peso.  I love some of those countries where you try to just buy something. 
[00:11:00]  It's like, that'll be 120,000.  It was absolutely ridiculous, man.  Whatever the hell it is.  You know, like Europe kind of figured it out.  Instead of having the lira and the Deutschmark and all that, they figured out the euro.  The euro.  That's close to the dollar.  You know, they kind of figured it out.  Mexico is still with their stupid, worthless peso.  I'd like to buy the ceramic hand-painted bull in Tijuana.  All right, that's 8 billion pesos.  That's 8 billion pesos. 
[00:11:30]  And then you go, oh, that's expensive.  10 bucks?  I don't want to pay that much.  8 billion?  It was so absolute crap there.  And then they give you this big deal on the plane, duty and tax free, which is a big fucking joke.  Yeah.  Everything's just so inflated that, you know, they've been knocking the duty and the tax off.  It means nothing.  It's ridiculous, man.  The money's worth nothing down there.  So where are you playing?  Tonight we're playing at a place called the Celtic House in Fiskill, New York. 
[00:12:00]  They're doing it on the 17th of the month.  They do a mini St. Paddy's Day every month.  And they're doing it tonight.  And we're actually, you know, about PBH.  We're on our way up there now.  Oh, you're doing a little radio.  Yeah, we're doing morning radio.  I have no idea what it's going to be about.  It's just me and Thomas doing a couple of acoustic tunes.  That's really cool.  What station?  WBH.  I mean, what show?  Poughkeepsie. 
[00:12:30]  I meant to say what show.  I'm sorry.  I don't know the name of the show.  I know nothing about it, except that we're on the air this morning around 9 o'clock.  All right.  Listen, we got pests in that area.  I mean, when Joe's on the radio, come on.  All right.  Help us out.  Absolutely, man.  Help us out.  We want to hear Joe doing some acoustic U2.  Yeah, we'll get the cell phone to the speaker and give us a call.  Poughkeepsie wrote a really good article about us today as well.  We'll get into that a little later.  Yeah.  Except for one little quote that pissed off Anthony.  Well.  I don't blame you, though, by the way. 
[00:13:00]  Taken out of context.  Huh?  We had some articles written on us down in Mexico, and I have no fucking idea what they say.  El gudo.  Right.  They're probably telling them how to kidnap you.  They're such a corrupt, awful place.  Be careful down there, man.  Horrid people.  That's all they do is kidnap people.  Kidnap for ransom.  Yeah.  Drugs.  The promoter that we had was kidnapped and held at gunpoint for two weeks.  They thought he was some politician's son.  And no shit, they held him for two weeks at gunpoint. 
[00:13:30]  And the guy almost died.  He was telling me that they were sticking him in the ribs with a knife.  Not enough to really hurt him, but enough to make him yell and scream.  While they had him on the phone with the people that they thought was his family.  And it wasn't his family, so the people that they were calling to get ransom from didn't give a fuck.  Yeah, go ahead.  They were like, you know, you're not my ego.  And they just kept on sticking.  This guy was screaming. 
[00:14:00]  And finally, they ended up, the guy that got kidnapped was actually very well connected with the Mexican mob.  A couple of weeks after he was kidnapped, they let him go.  And they realized it really wasn't the guy that they were trying to get extort money from his family.  And he ended up getting two pictures back from this mobster of the guys that kidnapped him with fresh holes in the front of their heads.  That's a wonderful place.  This is the shit that goes on in Mexico City, man. 
[00:14:30]  That's your promoter?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy, that's our promoter.  That's exciting.  What other country is he going to go to?  Well, actually, we're heading to Panama.  Panama, they're going to send us down to South America now, too.  We're going to Panama?  Screw the third world nations.  How about somewhere cool?  How about Yemen and Beirut?  Yeah, that would be an upgrade for you guys.  That's an encore.  We don't give a fuck, man.  They pay us right now.  Oh, my God.  Two you and Karachi. 
[00:15:00]  Really?  Dude, you two are going down to South America this year, too.  Hey, man, we're proud of you, Joe, but come on.  I mean, you're traveling the world, but...  I think we might be going to...  Your passport's got to look pretty damn scary.  Yeah, really.  I know.  Two you is the only tribute band on the terror watch list because of the places they go to.  We were stopped at a couple of customs, I think.  They'd be looking at all this electronic shit that was bringing them out like it was bombed. 
[00:15:30]  If you ever decide to play anywhere in the Middle East, you should take that picture of Mohammed  with the bomb on his head off of your drum set.  And, dude, if you ever play Indonesia, put some heroin in a guitar case and take it out  of the country.  They slap you on the wrist there.  Yeah, it's a mere slap on the wrist.  Nice.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  Well, good luck with your radio interview.  When you're there, tell them that every time they use the word instant feedback that 
[00:16:00]  they should send us a royalty check and have fun.  We'll be at the Celtic house this evening in Fishkill, New York on Main Street.  It's Main Street Plaza.  Check them out.  Big fun.  Big fun.  All right.  Brother Joe.  To you.  Joe.  Where's Joseph?  There you go.  Yeah, he's gone.  To you.  Great band.  You too.  Tribute band.  I want to congratulate him on his success.  He really deserves it, man.  We never see him anymore, by the way.  No, I know.  Family, anybody.  Every time I talk to my family, it's like, oh, where's Joe? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, I don't know.  He's in fucking Japan.  Who thought a tribute band could be so lucrative?  And they're playing what?  Every weekend?  Every weekend.  Every night?  Every night.  They're somewhere else.  They're like a real touring fucking band where they take a couple of nights off.  They're back on the road all over the country and now the world.  For some reason, U2 strikes a chord with people that even if it isn't really U2 and it's close enough, they act like it's U2. 
[00:17:00]  You know what I love about Joe's band?  They play a lot of songs that U2 stopped playing years ago, too, which makes it really cool if you're a real U2 fan.  They have a huge repertoire of all the hits and all the obscure stuff.  They can mix it up every night, you know?  Right.  Didn't Jim Laird, who was the singer, and he was a good singer, and he left, right?  He was out of the band.  It was a little friction.  The thing about tribute bands...  It was a little fallout, but Joe was so freaking talented, he just brushed that off like, 
[00:17:30]  whatever, dude.  Brush it off, get another guy.  Watch what I do now.  Watch what I do.  Here's the trouble with tribute bands, though.  And this is pretty much any band, but tribute bands it really seems to happen in.  The guys in the band hate each other.  I don't know what it is.  There's usually a couple of guys that are tight, and that's the case in a lot of the tribute bands.  Yeah.  And then some other peripheral guys that have problems, and they're constantly being changed  in and out and shifted.  It's not like, you know, a regular band that is playing their own music. 
[00:18:00]  You know, the tribute band, hey, we'll throw out the drum, we'll get a new one.  Did you see tribute yet?  Yeah, we'll get a new one.  On Showtime or whatever cable channel had it?  Unbelievable.  Can you get it on DVD?  I don't even know.  Unbelievable.  It was great.  We should start a tribute band.  One of these guys started believing he was Gene Simmons, and he burned his whole house  down, practicing blowing fire.  Isn't that wonderful?  I don't know.  It's a great, great documentary on tribute bands, if you ever see it on the old cable.  Mr. Hughes, what's up? 
[00:18:30]  Good morning, boys.  What is up?  And Angel Buns there.  I would like to request an older bit, please.  Okay.  We could do that for you, sir.  I would very much love to hear Brother Joe imitating James Taylor covering DMX.  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind and dedicate that to fucking Pharrell.  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind up in here, up in here. 
[00:19:00]  Y'all gonna make me go on out up in here, up in here.  Y'all gonna make me act a fool up in here, up in here.  Y'all gonna make me lose my cool up in here, up in here.  If I gots to bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  All you man's up in the jail before, suck my dick.  And all them other cats you run with, get done with dumb quick.  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some dumb shit?  All right.  There go the gun clip.  9-1-1 shit.  All over some dumb shit. 
[00:20:00]  Ain't that some shit?  Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club.  Cause every time you come around, it's like, what?  I just gotta get my dick sucked.  And I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking to, but I'm not him.  I ain't slim.  So watch what you do while you go. 
[00:20:30]  Find yourself very next to someone else.  And we all thought you loved yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that.  Now cause they amiss.  You shit, a nigga tried to diss you.  That's why you're laying on your back  Looking at the roof of the church  Preacher telling the truth  And you know that it hurts 
[00:21:00]  Yeah  Whoa, y'all gon' make me lose my mind  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me go on out  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me act a fool  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me lose my cool  Up in here, up in here 
[00:21:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  Up in here  Y'all gon' make me act a fool  Up in here, up in here  Up in here  Y'all don't make me lose my mind.  Y'all don't make me up in here.  Y'all don't make me go all out.  Brother Joe, everyone.  Brother Joe. 
[00:22:00]  Stop the presses, by the way.  E-Rock's eating fruit.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Are you feeling all right?  What is it?  Bacon is no longer on my list.  Very good, E-Rock.  We scare you.  Oh, yeah.  The mayo thing went away, and now the bacon thing's gone away.  No more bacon.  Good boy.  Be honest.  Is this the first time you've eaten fruit in front of us?  No, I've actually done it many times.  You just never noticed it until I stopped the bacon.  What happened? 
[00:22:30]  We never noticed because it's usually covered in mayo.  Yeah, we couldn't see it under a pork chop.  When you got home, did you find a note from your heart to cut the shit, fucko?  We were discussing cholesterol on the way home yesterday.  Jim and I were walking back to the hood, and I was telling Jim that I was feeling really  good about myself when we started talking about cholesterol.  E-Rock is what?  208?  207.  207?  27 years old?  That's a little scary.  Yeah, it's a little high for 27 years old.  For 27 years old. 
[00:23:00]  And then I was feeling really good about myself yesterday.  I'm like, well, watch the reaction from the boys when I tell them my cholesterol.  Feeling really good.  And I'm like, I'm 136.  And Anthony just laughed at that and swatted me away and said, yeah, I'm 85.  85.  That's, like, ridiculous.  Yeah, well, it's all about chicken and broccoli and water.  And club soda.  That's it.  Broccoli bugs me, though.  I love broccoli. 
[00:23:30]  It's like a little tree, and you eat the leafy part.  Yeah, you just chomp off the head.  Just chomp off the head of the broccoli.  I prefer asparagus.  Yes, grilled asparagus.  Yes.  Makes your peas stink.  I love that.  I like broccoli rabe.  I smell radio bit.  What's your favorite vegetable?  What's your favorite vegetable, everybody?  Come on, everybody.  Let's call the phones.  Hey, what's your favorite vegetable? 
[00:24:00]  Hello?  I used to like shivo.  Whoa.  Wow.  So you made something.  I was going to go old school.  That's so funny.  What's her name?  Karen Carpenter?  No.  Karen Quinlan.  Quinlan.  Oh, Karen Ann Quinlan.  Yeah.  Karen Ann Quinlan.  All right.  Let's get into the show.  Brother Joe, thanks for calling.  There's Brother Joe's song.  Anthony's taking his coat off.  That's good.  That's good.  Warming up a little bit.  Warming up a bit, finally.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Half hour into the show.  Yeah, you can turn that off.  You know what?  That little space heater did the job there, Erod.  It's hot over here.  It heated a space.  That's right.  How about that?  But it's tiny, though.  It is little.  All right.  So I want to know.  Does it say something like little giant space heater?  I love when a product has to put the word Lil on it.  I do, too.  It makes it adorable.  So I want to know what the hell happened last night with the office cam.  All right.  Well.  All I know.  I'll give you my side of this. 
[00:25:00]  Uh-huh.  I walked into work, and I saw a crew that just looked really hungover.  A crew that looked like they haven't slept.  Yeah.  Ben's like, oh, wow.  After the show, we all decide to go out and drink.  But it seemed like it went all night long.  All night long.  I guess the interns and Ben did a little of that drinking.  Had a little fun drinking.  And it ended up here at the studio and in the office. 
[00:25:30]  And I just got this email from somebody.  I don't know if I should say who it was.  But it just said, check out the office cam.  So I punch it up.  And the second it comes on, I just see a man's ass in full view, fully zoomed in, with cheeks spread and asshole just gaping.  There was gaping, male ass gaping going on in the office last night. 
[00:26:00]  An ass cave for everybody.  Ass cave, male ass gaping.  And see, I got something set up between my home computer and my computer here at work.  I can access either of them from either computer.  Totally.  So you can turn on this one, too?  No, I don't have this, the studio one.  That would be cool if you could turn that one on every once in a while.  Yeah, it's something to do with the problem with the corporate computer.  You can't load the proper software. 
[00:26:30]  Are you sure the office cam is on all the time now?  Yeah, well, sometimes it gets shut off, but I can turn it on from home.  That is, unless somebody shuts the computer here off or trips over it or vomits or pisses on it.  I don't know what they did last night, but I couldn't access it after a while.  And we were having a fight.  Like I said, I can access the computer.  So my work computer desktop shows up on my home desktop, and I can click on all the icons and work anything I want. 
[00:27:00]  I could also type in, if I log on to PalTalk under one of the names, let's say Opant1 in the office, I type in, and I'm Opant1.  I punch up my camera, and it's the camera from the office.  But I'm home typing in whatever I want.  If some drunk intern or worker is in here, and they sit down, they could type in.  All of a sudden, I'll see what they're typing before they even post it.  And then they'll hit return, and under the same name now, there's two different people posting. 
[00:27:30]  So, like I said, I log on.  I'm looking at man-ass, trying to figure out who it is.  Slowly backs away, and there I see.  Hold on.  How do you figure out whose it is?  Well, I couldn't.  I mean, come on.  I couldn't at first.  Well, it's very easy.  Danny's is a little hairier.  I would say Derek's is more supple.  I couldn't figure out whose it was.  So, what I immediately did.  You kind of stepped into something there, though. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, yeah, I did.  Because you said all you saw was man-ass.  All I saw was man-ass.  And then you were trying to figure out whose it was.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you say?  You have to have some kind of smell involved to figure out whose boy it was?  Well, sometimes.  No, so the first thing I did was click on my program called Snagit, and I framed-  You have the gayest computer ever.  It's called Snagit.  Snagit.  Snagit.  Snagit.  And I-  You're the bad boy of computing. 
[00:28:30]  I'm the bad boy of computing.  You should be called Faggot.  Faggot.  Snagit.  Snagit.  I framed-  What does a Snagit do?  Well, I clicked on it, started up, and I framed the- I clicked and dragged to pull a little  frame around the window that showed the man-ass in full video, and it captures video.  So now I'm getting live video of what's going on, so I have it for evidence.  Oh, not just photos. 
[00:29:00]  Not photos, dude.  This is video.  Ooh, he has it for evidence, Jimmy.  Oh, now I have it.  On his home computer.  Yes.  I watch it all the time.  I'm the bad boy of man-ass video.  So, yeah, the camera- well, the camera stays in the same place, but the person, the perp,  starts moving away from the camera a little, and I notice it is our own Danny.  It is Danny's ass on the camera, and there he is laughing like an idiot with his pants 
[00:29:30]  pulled down.  Like an idiot.  Like an idiot, yeah.  No, laughing.  He's a laughing idiot.  As an idiot.  So I thought he was just having a little fun, and that was pretty much it.  Moon the camera, have a few laughs, and leave.  This went on for hours.  Hours.  And not just Danny.  Danny types in. 
[00:30:00]  Now, like I said, I could see what he's typing.  For most people, in any kind of chat setup, you only see what the person has typed.  Since I'm looking in as if it's my computer, I can see what he's typing in before he hits  enter.  He's trying to type like, I'm so drunk.  And it's like, I, N, greater sign, K, U, N, C, and, apostrophe, back, back, back, erase, erase. 
[00:30:30]  It's taking him forever to type anything.  And I type, you're drunk off your ass.  He goes, oh yeah, out with Ben last night, and we were doing a little drinking.  And then out of nowhere, you want to see Derek's bag?  And this is far from closed circuit.  This is the open Opie and Anthony live room.  So there's people in it.  There's fucking hundreds of people in the room. 
[00:31:00]  Because like we have been saying lately, this experience, the Opie and Anthony experience,  just continues after we end the radio show.  So there's Derek now with his eyes are slits because he's like smiling.  He's all drunk and walks up to the camera, pulls his zipper open, and pulls his dick  and bag out, holding his cock so you can't really see it, and tea bags in front of the  camera.  So all you're seeing is his yam bag in front of the camera, and they're all laughing their 
[00:31:30]  asses off.  That is the weirdest shit.  And then more, so now the battle starts.  Because I can control the mouse from home.  They can control it from here in the studio.  So it's a big tug of war trying to get, because I'm trying to bounce them from the room.  They're trying to stop me from bouncing and shut down the program that lets me see it  from home.  So I pull down the thing, and now I'm trying to click on the control that removes any 
[00:32:00]  control they'll have of the keyboard.  Every time I click on it, they unclick it.  So it's this back and forth thing going on.  This war going on.  And I finally lose it.  I lose the battle.  I lose the picture.  I lose everything.  Meanwhile, they lose the feed to the internet.  So they have no camera right now.  About 15 minutes goes by.  I'm able to log back on.  So I log back on to the office cam to see what's going on. 
[00:32:30]  The camera slowly fades in.  They couldn't possibly have known that the camera was on or off or coming on or anything.  As it fades in, there's two asses in front of it, spread cheeks, assholes a-blazing, like  they stood there for 15 fucking minutes waiting for that camera to come back on.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, I didn't get into guest number three that was in the studio also, which is probably, 
[00:33:00]  yes, it gets sicker than this, than two men showing bag, dick, and ass to hundreds of people.  I'm watching the pad data as you talk about this.  First it said Danny is gay, and now it says Derek is gayer.  And I was holding out hope for good old Derek.  I thought he was like the normal one.  I thought he was the responsible one.  I thought he was the behind-the-scenes guy, just wants to do his job and go home, but. 
[00:33:30]  Nope.  Man, he's got the spotlight today.  Last night, you add a little booze to these guys.  Do you remember any of this?  A little booze.  A little bit.  A little booze?  What were you guys drinking?  I don't even know.  You don't even know?  You must have blacked out.  Yeah.  Because you were doing and saying shit that just was so fucking inappropriate.  That was dangerous drunk.  Yeah.  Really dangerous drunk.  Yeah.  So I'm looking, and all of a sudden, I look at the camera, I look at the feed, and there's  a woman in our office. 
[00:34:00]  And I'm like, what is going on here?  Probably not the first time there was a woman in our office.  But she didn't look like the kind of woman that these two would be bringing back for  some action or anything.  She was a little older.  Didn't seem like the type.  It seemed like the type, if you were your guy's age, and you went and got a little drunk,  you'd pick her up.  You know.  I'm trying my best not to insult the woman.  Go right ahead.  Because she was Danny's mother. 
[00:34:30]  Danny, I guess, went out drinking with his mom, came back to the office, showed his ass,  his yam bag, along with Derek, and brought his mom along.  But then the signs started getting held up in front of the camera, because people were  asking, who's the woman in there?  And he said, my mom.  My mom, she's looking for action.  She likes the big black cock, is the sign that Danny then held up about his mother, who 
[00:35:00]  was on camera.  He also held up a sign that said, I want to fuck my mother.  You did not.  Dude, what is wrong with you?  Yes, he did.  Then he said she's looking for action and big black cock, and gave out her work email address  to the hundreds of people that were on Pal Talk at the time, watching this fucking atrocity  go down in our office. 
[00:35:30]  She's hot?  Huh?  Is she hot?  Well, she's not my type.  She's not, you know.  I like, I like him a little younger, you know, than his mom.  His little brother's cute, though.  That disturbed me, too.  How did my family get involved?  The fact that his little brother-  How did your family get involved with this?  Is watching this shit.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, because he's on, he's in the room, he's watching his older brother hold up signs 
[00:36:00]  that say he wants to fuck his mother.  It was, dude, hours.  It was an hour from the time Danny posted, well, I'm out of here, till the time I think  he actually left.  And that was already over an hour into the whole thing.  And I think Derek might have passed out somewhere near the facility, in the facility.  I have no idea.  I couldn't find him.  By the time I punched the camera back up, it was all askew, pointing at something that 
[00:36:30]  meant nothing.  I did see Travis walk in.  All this debauchery is going on.  All this very gay shit is going down.  And then these two leave the camera for a few seconds.  And Travis walks in and sits down at the computer to get some work done.  Like, it was just surreal.  I don't know what the fuck goes on in this place.  And all you could see was, I know Than was somehow involved in the situation, but he 
[00:37:00]  was playing it safe.  All you could ever see was the top of his hat, because he would never be in camera.  He was skulking around, like doing a low crawl past the camera so no one could really see.  Well, he's holding on hope to be a politician still.  Yeah, you don't want these.  Just in case.  Dude, I have career-ending video if you ever want to pursue a career in politics or anything.  Anything.  But I'll hand this over to you.  I certainly don't want them. 
[00:37:30]  The phones.  A lot of pal talkers checking in that saw this last night.  Matt from Yonkers, what's up?  Hey, you guys forgot the best sign.  My mom speaks Greek.  Oh, yeah.  You held up the...  Was your mom hammered?  Probably.  I can't even tell you.  You all seemed a little drunk.  I was so hammered.  By the way, I saw her fucking with the television set.  Oh, did she really?  Oh, yeah.  She was fucking with the plasma TV in the office.  Want to check out the Olympics or something? 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  Joe from Brooklyn.  She was writing signs, handing the denny here.  That's the black cock.  Hold on, Joe.  Hold on, Joe.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Morning, guys.  Am I the only one that finds this, like, extremely disturbing?  No.  No, you're not the only guy.  You should have seen it.  We got gaping assholes.  We got ball bags.  What went on?  What do we got?  A Guys Gone Wild video going on?  Hey, man.  What went on behind us?  Here's the deal.  Your heroes have flaws.  Many, many flaws.  That's the beauty of this show.  We just throw it all at you. 
[00:38:30]  All the scars and warts.  It was a wreck.  Yeah.  So then for the rest of the night, any room I went into, I also have another program where  instead of a camera feed from Pal Talk, I could pump in any video I want, and it shows  up on the screen.  So I would go into the rooms and just replay the videos of these guys showing their ass  and ball bags in any room I went into.  That was really good when later on in the night, I was in the 1,000-person-strong O&A war 
[00:39:00]  room, and your ass and ball bag was prominently displayed.  That was the rallying cry.  That was.  Battle cry.  It was like Braveheart.  Yeah, right.  And they all lifted their kilts.  Freddie Trek from Jamaica Station on the feedback.  Oh, yeah.  You click and drag that man ass with your snag it, homo.  Yes, I snagged that ass.  Wow.  Well, here's a good question from Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up? 
[00:39:30]  Hey, any pubes on your keyboard?  No.  As a matter of fact, the second my bagel came here this morning to eat, I went to reach  for the mouse and realized they were touching their ball bag and spreading their ass cheeks  and then using the mouse to chat.  So I pretty much napalmed my desk, keyboard, and mouse with Lysol, and there it sits being  disinfected.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Iker's.  It looks like Iker's. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I was in the room at the same point Anthony was, apparently.  I didn't know it.  Yeah.  The first thing I saw when I opened up the office can was a ball sack, and I'm like,  what the hell is going on in the office?  And I waited, and it pans back, and it's Derek, and I was just, like, in shock.  And then I'm also watching the chat, and it's exactly like Anthony described.  It was, you're so wasted, and then a bunch of gibberish.  And I'm like, who are they talking to?  Yeah, it's hard to explain, because the people that were just viewing saw the name Ope Ant 
[00:40:30]  One, where every other message was coherent, because that was me replying to the first message  from Ope Ant One, which was Danny just babbling drunk, and me saying, you are fucking drunk.  So it was like a schizo.  Anyone from the outside looking in is like, why is this guy talking to himself, one drunk,  one calling him a drunk?  That is.  I didn't figure it out, so I clicked on, I thought, this is Dan's brother, and I opened 
[00:41:00]  that up, and there's a mini Danny without the facial hair, and I'm thinking, what the heck  is going on?  And the mom's in the room, too.  It was so bizarre.  Danny's whole family is involved in this program now.  Well, we got a lot of instant feedback here.  Don't forget Naked Dad.  Naked Dad, right, of course.  Axl from New York City, after he held up a sign saying, I want to fuck my mother, did  he flush his XM radio down the corner and buy a series?  You had the order all wrong.  And then Nick from Columbus, Ohio, Danny to his mom, I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[00:41:30]  And Bert from Philly, Mom, I have to move the camera now.  I've got to do this.  I've got to do this.  Russ from Philly, what's up?  Hey, I want to get Danny's mom email address.  Yeah, can you give that a email address?  Everyone else got it.  No, I probably shouldn't.  Oh, yeah, no.  It's just going to be out there.  Let's see.  He started regretting things, because then I started getting emails to my email address  going, accidentally shut down your program you used to talk between the two PCs. 
[00:42:00]  Sorry about that.  Well, I just wanted to make it abundantly clear that it wasn't me.  Yeah, it was Derek that did it.  Hey, let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, angry typing guy?  I'm all right.  Uh, yeah, Danny's starting to sound a little bit like Bad Boy Bubby.  Oh, oh.  You know, we never finished watching that Bad Boy Bubby movie. 
[00:42:30]  I watched it at home.  I got that movie yesterday off of Netflix.  Yeah.  And you're right, I started watching it, and then once he's, like, in the city and shit,  it just sort of, like, tears out.  But, oh, my God, that first, like, half hour was so sick and brutal.  What he does to that cat, and then his mom and his father.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a great, great first half hour, 45 minutes.  That's a good boy.  All right, thank you, buddy.  Well, this is a very good question from Chris in West Virginia.  Chris?  Hey, Danny, just curious if you got lucky last night with your mother. 
[00:43:00]  Well, it is West Virginia.  They need to know.  It was really, really disturbing, man.  One more.  Jim in Ohio.  Jim?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, it sounds like at nighttime they got the Brokeback Broadcasting Network going on.  No kidding.  And then, yeah, and then they, like, it isn't gay enough showing live man ass and ball bag,  but they think it's going to freak people out if they take a magazine picture of a buff man  and tape it up in front of the camera. 
[00:43:30]  After all that.  Once again, that was Derek as well.  After all that going down, live ball bag teabagging of the camera,  like a fucking model of a guy, a picture of a model guy being taped in front of the camera  is going to be shocking.  Derek's a little red.  Oh, yeah.  That's why this is a huge surprise.  So is his sack.  This is why it's a huge surprise.  It's Derek we're talking about.  He was the guy we never thought would get into this crap.  No, you expect it out of some of the other guys. 
[00:44:00]  And then Danny's trying to make an excuse that he never went to college,  so he's getting it out of his system.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He's like 32 years old or something, and he's finally living college life.  The binge drinking.  Yeah, he's going to mixers.  Right.  That's kind of what happens, though, when you don't go to college.  You know, alcoholism, incest.  Yeah.  It happens.  Homoerotic moments with your coworkers in front of a camera.  Only Derek goes, ugh, when you put it that way, ugh. 
[00:44:30]  Well, I noticed that he showed a picture of Derek bending over,  and fucking Derek is all bagged.  It's amazing.  He can't hide.  We all did notice that, Derek.  What a bag you have.  Congratulations.  It's so weird.  You know, I get in here, and people start handing me stuff in the newspapers  and, you know, stuff for the show, you know?  Yeah.  And I'm like, all right, probably Olympic stuff and probably this and that.  And they're handing over, you know, photos on paper of Derek's ball bag  going, you've got to check this thing out.  Yeah, check it out.  You can see it from every angle. 
[00:45:00]  It's like, I wanted to hit it.  Heavy bag.  The speed bag.  Yeah, working on the speed bag.  Yeah, right on.  Mark in Minnesota.  Hey, are you guys going to be, you know, making a video of all these luscious bags  and man-ass available online or anywhere?  I mean, come on, ONA hot webcam-ass.  Yeah, what are you going to do, Ant?  You got the video.  What are you going to do with it?  Um, delete it.  Maybe Steve can put up a new site.  Oh.  Rate my bag. 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  ONA workers gone wild.  Well, that webcam is on 24 hours a day now, more or less.  Hot man-on-man action.  The office cam.  The action has drastically increased on the office cam.  You just never know when it's going to pop up and what the fuck is going to happen in  front of it.  Horrid.  Can we do office cam day?  Hmm.  What will that entail?  I thought that was yesterday.  It's a very easy concept.  Maybe Don could see if we can get away with this legally. 
[00:46:00]  We, uh, we, you know, put all the shutters down or shades or whatever, lock the door,  and then it's like an open call for people to come up here and do whatever the hell they  want on the office cam.  In front of the office cam?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's good.  It's like office cam day.  Uh-oh.  That is good.  Why, uh-oh.  I just see problems.  Why?  I see-  The listeners.  I see greatness.  I do, too.  The listeners.  Don, that's your homework assignment.  That's good.  It's almost like the- 
[00:46:30]  We want to do office cam day.  You know what it is?  It's almost like a confessional for MTV.  You know how they did that with the real world?  They would have the confessional where you'd go in alone to a room in front of  the camera and either talk or do whatever you want.  That was your time.  Now, people are thinking about the obvious, you know, the sex angle, but it could be anything.  It could be anything.  You could confess shit.  You could just, uh, whatever.  Yeah.  Propose to your girl.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything goes. 
[00:47:00]  We want to do office cam day on the Open Anthony program.  Don, get that done.  Please.  That is a good one.  Like it?  Because it's wow.  How often do you have to shift so you're not sitting on your bed?  You can't get over the bag on this kid.  Yeah.  Your bag has down syndrome.  I was going to ask, is it healthy or not?  It looks normal, but it was just hanging like a big, just a big red ornament.  It was normal.  No lumps, no bumps.  Are you really 82 years old or?  How old are you?  22.  Jesus. 
[00:47:30]  Jesus.  He was holding his, he was just holding his cock and his bag was just hanging from  his hand, from the bottom of his hand in front of the camera.  And Danny likes to say he wasn't doing that, but he was, I didn't do it.  He had his ball bag out, Danny, and he's squeezing it.  Like, he's squeezing it, so it's just popping out all veiny and shoving it into the camera.  And then at one point, you just dangled your dick right in front of the camera, Danny. 
[00:48:00]  Did I really?  Yeah, you did.  Oh, boy.  You were zipping back up, and your dick just flopped in front of the camera.  Oops.  Was mom impressed?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Derek, you have your pants pulled down midway down your thighs, and your bag is hitting your  back belt loop.  Look, look at this picture.  It is hitting the back belt loop of his pants, and they're pulled halfway down.  Old taffy bag.  I could actually, on a black and white photo from a cam ten feet away, see the definition 
[00:48:30]  from ball to ball.  Yeah.  This fucking kid is really a...  It might be cold in here in the mornings, but I guess at night, very warm.  Old Reagan neck.  A nice Reagan neck bag.  A turkey bag.  Click clack.  I could not believe that that was your mom in here, too.  With all that going on, I kept saying, no way that's his mom, because he would not be  saying shit like this, but he had no problem with it. 
[00:49:00]  All right, let's go.  By the way, how fast on a black bag is the name?  Derek's bag.  Oh, boy.  Derek's bag.  Let's go to Ryan in Pennsylvania.  Ryan?  Yeah, I want to know how many mousetraps Derek could fit on his ball bag.  I think it's so huge.  We're going to have to get, I don't know, dozens.  All right.  Thanks, Ryan.  Yep.  Bye.  So, there you have it.  That's what was happening last night.  Yeah.  A lot of fun going on when we're not here, Opie.  Yeah.  What was Ben doing all this? 
[00:49:30]  Wisely, he went home.  Yeah, Ben actually went, they were drinking, they outdrank Ben last night.  Ben decided, I had enough.  Yeah.  And he went home, and these guys continued drinking.  Well, that wasn't just a beer buzz, either.  Apparently, we did a lot of shots, but.  Yeah.  Just really don't remember.  How do you get up?  How are you up this early?  I have no fucking idea.  I have no idea.  I don't know how he does it.  I gotta be.  I'm just numb right now.  I'm tired, and I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night.  Well, I know who that is.  Wow, G. Gordon Liddy.  Wow, look at that. 
[00:50:00]  I forgot we were talking to G. Gordon Liddy today.  All right.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  From that to Liddy.  Yeah, gay office cam to G. Gordon Liddy.  That's what the Opie and Anthony show is all about.  This show is.  Thanks, guys.  Guys, great job.  Thanks.  Yeah.  All right, a quick break, and we'll talk to G. Gordon Liddy next.  Go get my limo.  I've got my hurtie.  That makes me sound like a really talented comic.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Only creeps listen to this program. 
[00:50:30]  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on your laughing hat.  It's time for the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Peter in Florida. 
[00:51:00]  Peter, what's up today?  What's happening, guys?  I just want to say your show just rocks, man.  Every morning on my ride to work, I listen to it.  You guys are excellent.  And basically what I wanted to say is Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge need to lick  you guys' nutsacks.  Yeah, wow.  Look at that.  Thank you.  They can have Derricks.  They can pick the Dingle Bears. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, thanks, Peter.  We're building something pretty special over here at XM.  I appreciate that.  Thank you so much, you guys.  Take care.  All right.  It's a whole experience.  It's a whole lifestyle.  I mean, we do a show for four hours every day, and then, I don't know, and then it just  continues all night long, all weekend long.  Now we've got a bar that the pets are hanging out at and a restaurant.  So we've got G. Gordon Liddy outside the studio.  We should get him in here.  We've got him for about a half hour, Anthony.  Holy jeez.  What?  I'm just thumbing through his book, and I'm petrified. 
[00:52:00]  God, he's got a book out, Fight Back, Tackling Terrorism, Liddy Style.  You know what that involves?  Yeah, we do.  Kicking some ass.  Mr. Liddy, how are you, sir?  I'm good to go.  I'm ready to launch.  How about you?  Ready to go.  A legend.  A pleasure to meet you there.  Absolutely.  We had you on the phone once.  Yeah.  Are you still doing a show on XM?  Yes.  Okay.  Yep.  The Ask Channel.  The Ask Channel, you got a show? 
[00:52:30]  Yep.  When is that on?  Just get the plug out of the way so people can hear you, you know?  I think it's noon to three.  Yeah.  At least he's doing a real show.  Some of these guys that do their shows on XM, it's like, when do you do your show?  Well, it's a 15-minute show, and it's from 12.15 to 12.30.  Wow, that must be a piece of cake.  We talked to Dale Earnhardt Jr. yesterday.  He does a half-hour show.  Half-hour show.  We want that contract.  Yeah.  We got four hours to roll here.  He's used to moving fast. 
[00:53:00]  That's true.  G. Gordon Liddy.  Is he going to beat us up if we are bad or something?  He could.  You're a security guy?  Yeah, my security guy.  Yeah.  I guess so.  I guess so.  I guess so.  20 years as a Navy SEAL commando in 37 different countries.  Holy crap.  You did?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I know.  He's retired now.  I went to the gym on Tuesday.  Wow. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, you must have seen a little bit of action then, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I can't go into that, though.  Hey.  No problem.  It's okay.  I'm not going to ask.  We really don't need to know.  I'm not going to ask.  I don't know nothing.  It's what they call a black operative, and they're not referring to race.  Right.  Right.  No, these guys show up on time.  I'm like, these are the guys that get the job done.  Yeah.  I'm a black ninja, so we probably have something in common.  Yeah, I'm sure you're just putting the fear into him there, Opie.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  He could take you out without even moving.  I know.  You could fling his watch over there and take your head off.  He's using mind control as we speak.  Mr. Liddy.  Sir.  You got a book, Fight Back.  Correct.  Tackling terrorism Liddy style.  That's right.  Now, who is this directed at?  It's directed at the American public.  Like everybody?  Yeah.  In my view, the American public, first of all, has no idea how vulnerable.  You know, we all are.  I think we all got a pretty good idea back in 9-11. 
[00:54:30]  Well, and their memories are short because they're...  That's what I've noticed, too, and that pisses me off, by the way.  Yeah, it really does.  And the other thing is that once we alert them to all these different vulnerabilities in the book,  which, by the way, was co-authored by my son,  then we tell you, you know, you don't have to just sit there and tremble in fear.  There are things you couldn't do, and indeed, if you're a head of a family  or if you've got a company or something like that, your employees really are your family,  you're morally obligated to do things. 
[00:55:00]  And this book will tell you what you can do.  There's one whole section of it in the rear there that has to do with medical things.  Neither my son or I felt that we should be giving medical advice,  so there's a very famed doctor who wrote that section.  And that is...  What type of medical advice would you even need in a book about fighting back?  Well, if you're talking about bioterrorism, chemterrorism, all these things.  Yeah, talking about anthrax, smallpox. 
[00:55:30]  Isn't there a fine line between being able to pursue your life  and your liberty and pursuit of happiness here in this country and paranoia?  Because I was thumbing through the book a little bit,  and some of the chapters scared the shit out of me.  I was like...  Well, that...  Then we achieved our purpose.  It almost seems like a paranoia,  but if you think about it, it makes sense.  So you kind of... 
[00:56:00]  Like, I'm on the fence about the whole thing.  I could go either way.  I could skip through life with my shoelaces untied  or barricade myself in the house with a lot of weapons.  Well, one of the things you have to decide,  depending upon what the threat is,  is whether you flee or whether you do what we call shelter in place.  And if you're going to do either one of those things,  you need to be prepared to do it.  If you have to do it now and you're not prepared, it's too late.  Yeah.  Now, you think everybody in this country should have some kind of a plan? 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  And be prepared for...  And they should rehearse it.  They should rehearse it.  Rehearse it.  Yeah.  And as the neighbors just think you're kooks, right?  Well...  But they're the ones banging on that shelter door  like the Twilight Zone episode.  Let us in!  Yeah, there you go.  So they should have a plan in action  or written up and practice it?  And practice.  Well, it's just like the insurance companies  correctly advise all families to do. 
[00:57:00]  You know, it's to have some rope ladders in the house  from the second floor  and to practice fire drill.  I mean, when I was a school kid,  we used to have fire drills.  I don't know whether they do anymore  because this public school system is so screwed up,  I don't know if they can spell fire drill.  Sometimes it's better they just burn down  some of these schools anyway.  I don't think...  As long as there's nobody in them, it's all right.  The chain's on the doors.  Hillary Clinton claims that she's going to be 
[00:57:30]  really tough on terrorism.  Pretty known that you're supportive, Hillary.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the problem with Hillary is,  you know, with terrorists, you've got to find them first.  And Hillary couldn't find Monica,  so I don't know if she can find a terrorist.  And what do you think about finding the terrorists?  We always seem to get the, you know,  the number two guy and the number three guy.  What about the name players, the marquee guys? 
[00:58:00]  Where are they?  Do you agree with the way the government's handling  trying to find these guys,  or would you go about it Liddy-style a little different?  Well, first of all,  I'm not the guy who knows  how the government is doing what it's doing right now.  He is, but he can't talk about it.  I understand that.  This guy knows all.  I'm not going to ask him either.  He knows exactly where Osama is.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Shut up, because even speculating  will have us all killed. 
[00:58:30]  Or they'll make us go hunting with Dick Cheney.  How awful is it when people like me  try to have a man-to-man chat with you  about terrorism,  like just some fucking mope from Jersey?  Like, dude, what they need to do,  you want to just spit in my face?  Yeah, how many times have you had to sit there  and listen to drivel that you know is drivel  and keep your mouth shut,  maybe bite your lip a little bit,  use some of that discipline?  Often.  Yeah?  Yeah, very often.  You just hear a lot of garbage.  I will tell you, though,  there are a lot of very talented people out there 
[00:59:00]  that are looking for the key individuals,  and it's not as easy as people think,  because the area that,  if we're talking about bin Laden right now,  is similar to Colorado,  only with much less of the forestry.  And, you know, he's gotten smart  because we have lots of equipment  that we're able to track any kind of communications,  if he's using any kind of what we call Mazent,  a bunch of different types of signals.  And that got given up. 
[00:59:30]  It was reported,  and so now he's basically surrounded by very few people,  and he literally lives in caves.  Do you think it's almost good that we haven't gotten him?  Because it seems to me like with so many eyes looking for him  and him still out there,  he really doesn't have the power of communication.  He needs to pull off another 9-11 type terrorist act.  Not that we don't have plenty of other guys to worry about.  There are a lot of other people. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, but it seems to me like Osama's one of those guys  that's kind of in a stalemate position right now  where he can't, he's not quite as dangerous  as maybe some other guy who would take over for him  if we were to get him with him.  Like the president of Iran?  Exactly.  Yeah, see.  There's another lunatic.  Oh, boy.  I mean, the president of Iran,  I don't know if you're aware of it or not,  but he believes that a 5-year-old boy  who disappeared in the 11th century 
[01:00:30]  is living down at the bottom of a well that's over there.  And he sends messages to that boy  down in the bottom of the well  and he listens to what the boy tells him.  And what the boy is telling him is  that he, the imam, will come back.  They will reestablish the caliphate.  The Muslims will take over the world,  but this can only be done.  And he won't come out of the well  unless and until there is war and chaos, 
[01:01:00]  and specifically the destruction of Israel.  Yeah.  And so this guy believes  God is commanding him to destroy Israel.  And the minute he gets an atomic bomb,  this nitwit will try.  Let me ask you a question,  because this is,  I've talked to somebody about this,  and one argument that was raised  is that he's kind of doing  what Kim Jong-il is doing,  which was trying to get people to notice him  and get a relationship going.  Because why would he,  I mean, obviously he's a religious fanatic, 
[01:01:30]  but why would he play his hand  so obviously and so quickly  when he doesn't even have a bomb yet,  knowing the entire world is going to focus on him  and Israel is going to want to pay his reactions?  He's very close to achieving a bomb, first of all.  And he does not seem to be disposed  to listen to the UN  any more than anybody else listens to the UN.  Kofi Annan does not impress him.  And from his perspective,  he is being logical.  And that is,  he says,  look, 
[01:02:00]  sure,  Israel can come back  and kill millions of us,  but there are billions of us,  and the Germans didn't leave that many Jews.  So,  you know,  we can wipe out the Jews,  and we can absorb that loss,  because after all,  all of us who are going to be killed  are going to go right up  and get the 72 virgins.  He doesn't realize,  of course,  that God has a sense of humor,  and all 72 virgins  are middle-aged Roman Catholic nuns.  He doesn't know that.  All fat chicks.  The joke's on you. 
[01:02:30]  Where did the number 72 come from,  by the way?  It comes from the Quran.  Yeah,  yeah.  You know,  it's interesting,  if you look at the Quran,  it's a really bloody thing.  There's constant stuff about,  you know,  you shall hate the Jews,  you shall hate the Christians,  they are your enemy,  kill them,  slaughter them,  all this kind of stuff.  There isn't a single passage  anywhere in there  about forgiveness  or anything of that sort.  No.  It's just all bloody.  But it seems everybody  kowtows to them 
[01:03:00]  and treats that religion  as if they are this,  you know,  there are good Muslims out there  that when their whole religion  is based on this violence  and genocide.  Well,  you know,  look,  there's Catholics  that don't go to mass,  there's Protestants  that don't go to services,  there's Jews  that don't go to synagogue,  and I'm sure there's Muslims,  you know,  who don't go to the mosque  and aren't ready to,  you know,  rip the throats out of Jews.  But the fact is,  the practicing ones,  and that's,  you know,  by far the majority, 
[01:03:30]  that's their religion.  That's what they believe  God commands them to do.  Do you think the world  is kind of seeing them  for what they are?  Yeah,  when we're starting to wake up.  Yeah,  I mean,  when you have a comic  that comes out,  a cartoon that comes out  that starts violence up  like it has been  in the past week  or two weeks  or whatever it's been.  Well,  that was very contrived,  Opie.  Now,  remember,  that cartoon.  That's Anthony.  Oh,  Anthony,  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Red-haired Opie.  Red-haired Opie. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Good,  good.  Italian guy,  Anthony.  A lot of people  make that statement.  were you the one  that put the tape  on the door  over there  at the hotel?  No,  it was guys working  on the door.  I was wondering.  At any rate,  I've forgotten  what I was talking about.  The cartoon  actually came out  in like last September  and,  you know,  nothing happened  and the agitators  took those 
[01:04:30]  and then added to them,  you know,  fake cartoons  and then went around  and went to Syria  and places like that  and said,  you know,  look what the infidels  have done now  and got them all worked up.  It's really contrived.  Yeah.  Well,  you know,  they seem to be  coming out of the woodwork,  burning down  Western businesses  and I think  even stupid Europe  has to open their eyes  and see that  there is a problem here.  Well,  yeah,  I think the Spanish  realizes a problem. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah,  well,  the Spanish have,  by stupid Europe,  I mean France.  That's pretty much  what I mean.  I don't like  singling one out  but I mean France.  The experts  at preemptive surrender.  Yeah,  sometimes Germany.  I was watching  Switch Subjects  a little bit.  I was watching  The Aviator  the other day  and it led me  to do a little research  on Howard Hughes  and I never knew  there was a link  between Howard Hughes  and the Watergate break-in.  Yes.  What was,  they really didn't get into it. 
[01:05:30]  I couldn't get much info on that.  What was the deal there?  it wasn't so much  the Watergate break-in,  it was the overall  intelligence operation  and we had received  information  that Howard Hughes  had had some dealings  out there in Vegas  with a certain  newspaper publisher  and the publisher  had a safe  and the safe  had information  in it 
[01:06:00]  that would be valuable  politically to us  and would be valuable  also to Howard Hughes.  So,  I and my partner  Howard Hunt  went out  to California  and met  the top officials  representing  Hughes  and we said,  look,  we have a community  of interest here.  A community  of interest?  You know,  we have the  techniques  and mechanics 
[01:06:30]  to be able  to go into this safe  and you've got  the jet aircraft  that can,  you know,  banish us  out of the desert  and we formed  a plan  but it fell through  when either  they couldn't  make the jet available  or there was  a problem  about the jet.  so that was  what that was about.  That was pretty much  his involvement there  because I know  he was a pretty big  Nixon supporter.  Yeah,  well,  he wasn't doing it  as a Nixon supporter.  It was in his interest 
[01:07:00]  to find out  certain things  that were in that safe.  That were in that safe,  right.  Different things  but same safe.  A lot of dealings  of that sort  went on back then.  Sure.  It's still going on now?  Sure.  Yeah.  Just different  cast of characters?  Yeah,  that's about right.  Do you miss  that life?  I mean,  obviously you're  very successful now  but I mean  it seems to me  that that was  excitement,  danger,  that kind of thing.  Well,  I don't miss it  because I still  have a pretty 
[01:07:30]  exciting life.  I mean,  I ride my Harley  2,500 miles  out to Sturgis  every year.  These are Israeli  paratrooper wings  that last jumped  out of a C-130  over Israel  leading the stick  when I was 73.  I'm on Fear Factor  next May 23rd.  Error is an animal,  isn't he?  What is he going  to make you eat?  They don't do that  anymore.  They have gross  out stuff  but they don't  do the eat thing.  It's not so much  eat. 
[01:08:00]  I've seen him  as a lot of  picking up things  at your mouth  and dropping them  off.  They really did  stop the eating thing?  I'm going to Iraq  in a couple of weeks.  You are?  Go see the troops?  Yeah.  That's got to be  an inspiration.  I don't like that.  I'm not sitting  around on my ass  bored.  No, I understand  that.  It's just, it seems  to me when you're  meeting with Howard  Hughes for some  clandestine safe  break-in, that  kind of stuff, that's  the secret agent  stuff.  Well, the neat  thing about it is  now, what, 30  some odd years  later I can talk 
[01:08:30]  about it.  My son, who's  Jim over here,  who's done far  more interesting  things, he can't  talk about it.  Yeah.  It's got to be  frustrating.  He's going to have  to wait and get a  talk show and  hopefully not have  to go through  everything you  went through.  I don't think  jail is a good  thing.  When do you get  to talk about  things?  Jail was  interesting, though.  That's got to be,  I don't doubt it.  That's going to be  tough for him that  he's got all this  crazy stuff that  he's done in his  life.  He can't tell a  soul, basically.  So disciplined,  Opie.  But when can you  talk about stuff  like that?  On your deathbed?  I mean, you know, 
[01:09:00]  I think once some  of the things that I  did, some of the,  you know, their code  word, and if they  released it, the  earliest would be  25 years.  25 years.  Anything really  cool?  Just nod.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Can you say it in  pig Latin?  Yeah, they'll never  figure it out.  How impressed would  we be?  You know, I was  involved in one of  the big ones, you  know, read in by the  agency and all that  stuff.  And it subsequently  was declassified and 
[01:09:30]  released, you know,  Project Jennifer, which  was the...  Ah, I go through  that every three  months.  I write a huge  check to the ex-wife  named Jennifer.  Project Jennifer  stinks.  Well, this was the  retrieval of a Soviet  submarine from the  bottom of the sea.  Now, I think Hughes  was involved in that  too.  As a matter of fact,  he was.  Yeah.  They actually  contracted him to  build the friggin'  submersible and the  platform that was  supposed to hide the 
[01:10:00]  whole thing.  It was called the  Glomar Explorer.  Why would you guys  saying all of you  put so much trust in  a guy that kind of  was a little kooky  for such a sensitive  operation, especially  at the time,  retrieving a Soviet  submarine?  Yeah, well, he had  his peculiarities, but  he was a genius at  what he did.  And, you know, we  wouldn't tap into  that genius.  The aircraft that he  came up with, you  know, were really  remarkable. 
[01:10:30]  State of the art.  You know, when you  think of, like, in  World War II, when it  began, the most  advanced plane in the  world was the  Messerschmitt.  The Messerschmitt,  1935, it came out  of that, automatic  leading edge slats  against the stall.  Yeah, it was just  for the German  defense, as Europe  sat there going,  yeah, they've got to  defend themselves with  these friggin'  attack bombers.  Great job.  Stupid Europe, and  again, France. 
[01:11:00]  It was a remarkable  airplane, you know, and  it was years ahead of  everything, and eventually  we caught up and  exceeded, but, you  know, that German  equipment was very  good.  Now, this Operation  Jennifer, I didn't  finish that one.  Did you guys pull  that off?  Were you able to get  that sub up, or?  Well, what we did was  we put out a story that  said that we got part  of it, but we didn't  get the part that had  what we wanted.  That's the story that  we put out. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  I mean, why tell  them, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the cover?  You said you were  going after something.  Going after nodes of  nickel on the floor  of the sea.  What a ridiculous  cover story.  We need these nodes  of nickel on the bed  of the sea, and it's  right around where  the Soviet sub sank.  Captain Bly dropped  his contact lenses.  That's great.  Just amazing.  Oh, boy.  The Soviets must have  been pretty PO'd at that  one, huh? 
[01:12:00]  Well, I mean, I guess  when they, by the time  they found out, I guess  there wasn't any  Soviet Union anymore.  Wow.  Well, at the time,  they had no clue that  you guys were going  after this thing?  No, they thought that  their boat was so deep  that it was irretrievable.  Oh, that no one  could get it, right.  No one could get it.  Yeah.  Ha-ha, showed them  again.  Wow.  Was it fun having such  a great enemy like the  Soviet Union? 
[01:12:30]  I mean, and I don't mean  fun like, ha-ha,  jolly laughs.  No, no, but I'll tell  you what's important  about the distinction.  Now, the Soviets were  our enemy.  They were very clever  and some of their  technological stuff  was terrific, that the  KGB deployed and so on.  But the Soviets weren't  crazy.  They were rational.  And so, you know, you  could plan something and  say, okay, these are  rational people.  They're not going to be  stupid and not suicidal  and hell like that.  This bird over in Iran 
[01:13:00]  and some of these other  ones, they are not  rational.  They're loony tunes.  Old tactics don't work.  Well, I mean, you know,  if, you know, they're  actually sending their  16, 17-year-old sons  and daughters to go  blow themselves up.  I don't know if you've  ever seen photographs of  them, you know, the mess  that makes.  And then they think it's  great, you know.  Up there with the 72  virgins and all that  stuff. 
[01:13:30]  At least with the Soviet  Union, there was a line  of communication open.  Sure was.  But there always seemed  to be a bargaining.  We'll remove these  missiles.  You remove these.  Don't put them here.  There was a rational  conversation that kept  us from bombing each  other.  You not only had, you  know, your regular lines  of communications, you  had back-channel  communications, you know,  because they weren't  crazy.  They didn't want to get  blown up anymore.  We want to get blown  up.  But they don't seem to  care these days. 
[01:14:00]  We got totally different.  I want your opinion on  something.  The Bin Laden message  recently when he came  out and he said something  about building an  Afghanistan government  with the West.  Was that, there was  like two lines of  thinking on that.  One is that he was  like asking for some  sort of truce because  he's getting his face  kicked in.  And two, that Islam has  this weird religious  thing where before you  commit some type of a  horrific act, you have  to give your enemy some  type of a warning,  which is speculation that  he had like a suitcase  nuke.  Well, no, their religion 
[01:14:30]  says that when you  confront an infidel, an  infidel is any non-Muslim,  you know, Jew, Christian,  or anything like that, or  purported Muslim who doesn't  buy into your, you know,  radical version of  Muslim, that you have these  different options.  First, you have to offer  them conversion.  You become one of us  and you're cool.  That's going to happen. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  The next thing you offer  them is to live amongst  them as dimini is the  word.  And what that means is  you're not a slave, but  you're like a 15th class  citizen.  You don't have many rights  and everything, but we'll  let you live.  Like Iraq over here, our  producer.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Treat him like that.  And then the last thing is  if, you know, the guy  doesn't buy it, well, then  you must kill him.  You must kill him.  Wow, that's quite a drop 
[01:15:30]  off.  How many choices.  Welcome to the club.  You're a slave or you're  dead.  Your choices.  There you go.  Lovely people.  How about one more step  in between, please?  Give us one more choice.  Unbelievable.  So how, well, obviously, through  fighting back, tackling  terrorism, Liddy style, this  is pretty much our only  recourse is to defend  ourselves as best we can  from these people that can't  be bargaining.  There's a lot of things you  can do.  But, I mean, we happen to be  in a port city right now.  We're in New York.  In Baltimore and places like 
[01:16:00]  that are port cities.  Primary targets.  And, you know, there's  thousands of these  containers being unloaded  from container ships.  That's just scary stuff,  yep.  Absolute tops, 20%, have had  any kind of screening at  all.  And any one of them could  have a nuclear bomb or  contain contaminants that,  you know, could wipe out  people.  I mean, there's no sense 
[01:16:30]  of urgency about it.  The people aren't  clamoring, saying to  Congress, for heaven's  sake.  Logistically, is it feasible  to even start some kind of  an inspection program on  these things?  I mean, because the sheer  number of these things that  come into the ports are  amazing.  Jim, this is a technical  question.  Why don't you respond to  that?  Sure.  The smart thing to do is  start looking and  investigating what's going  into the containers when  they're being loaded.  And that's simple  tracking mechanisms.  Isn't that a little  difficult in some of these 
[01:17:00]  countries that we're kind  of eh with?  Well, if you want to  trade with the United  States, the largest market  in the world, you've got  some leveraging power.  All right.  So you do that.  The point is, don't let it  get close to the port.  Because if you get a nuke  into a port, besides the  nuke, you get the tidal  wave also.  So you're finished.  It's too late.  You need to start when  they're being packed.  And you need to follow  what they call the value  chain.  Every way you want to make  sure that these containers  are not being affected or  tampered with.  It seems to me that greed,  a lot of times, outweighs  security.  And if a country is faced  with the, you will not be 
[01:17:30]  able to export your goods  to the United States unless  we're able to inspect your  containers, I can't see the  United States government  saying that and losing  revenue by saying something  like that.  I mean, you have to have  the will to do it.  And it is our national  security.  I'd like to see it.  What is our government  here for?  Yeah.  Well, I'd like to see it,  but I don't see it.  The government is here to  persecute opium ants.  Well, not here on satellite  radio for now anyway, which 
[01:18:00]  thank God for that.  We've got total freedom  here.  So what did you think  bin Laden's message was?  That was what I wanted to  ask you.  No.  I think he's feeling the  pressure and he was being  consistent with his religious  beliefs.  You know, the problem is that  area of the world is, in  diplomatic terms they call it,  not responsive to a central  government. 
[01:18:30]  He's up there in warlord  territory.  Yeah.  You know, it's like there's  certain parts of Africa  where, you know, you don't  want to go, you know, you  go up in certain parts of  Africa and you say Kwanzaa and  they'll put a spear through you  immediately.  Machete you to pieces.  Yeah.  Well, the phones, we've got to  get a few of these calls on.  Larry in New Jersey, what's  up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Liddy, with what you were  talking about, the ports,  there was a big story recently 
[01:19:00]  in the Times about the six  ports that were sold to the  United Arab Emirates.  Don't you think that's going  to make it easier for them to  bring in New Jersey?  Okay.  What that's about is that  there was a company that was  a U.K.-based, a British  company.  What the company did was manage  and administer ports.  And that company was sold to a  company that operates out of the  United Arab Emirates.  And I don't think that they're 
[01:19:30]  going to, you know, the United  Arab Emirates are going to be  really stupid and try to do  something like that.  But you've got to, you know,  you've got to watch them anyway.  I mean, when President Carter gave  the Panama Canal to the  Panamanians, I don't think he  anticipated that a Chinese company,  which is a front for Chinese  intelligence, would now be  operating and controlling both 
[01:20:00]  ends of the Panama Canal.  Yeah, good move.  Good move.  Jesus.  All right, let's go to Hangman in  Wisconsin.  Hangman!  Hey, I've got a question for  G. Gordon Liddy.  Yeah.  Is it true that when you used to  go to parties that you could  actually hold a lighter under your  arm until the skin would burn?  I could, but it was not something  that I did as a party trick.  I did that once to recruit an 
[01:20:30]  agent, a female agent out of, you  know, working for the other side.  And she said, well, I'm frightened.  What happens if I get caught?  I said, well, nobody's going to know  because the only two people in the  world who will know are you and me.  You're not going to tell on  yourself and nobody can make me  or tell on you.  And she said, they can make  anybody talk.  And I said, no, they can't.  And I demonstrated it.  That's all.  Okay.  Wow.  Let's go to Shruggy. 
[01:21:00]  Shruggy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, real quickly.  Gee, I met you about 20 years ago  when you were doing your college  tour with Abby Hoffman.  Oh, yeah.  And two things I'll never forget.  One is I briefly met you on stage.  And number one, Jim, you'll like  this.  You have the most luscious blue  eyes.  But I just remember that.  I don't have blue eyes.  I don't know who you're thinking  about.  I just remember just you were  very nice.  But I just remember that I got the  least bit out of line how quickly  you could kill me.  But anyway, you told this story  about how once you kill the guy  by shoving a knife between a guy's 
[01:21:30]  shoulder, right between that skin,  that space in between the clavicle  and what you did, could you just  repeat that story?  Yeah, except I did not say that I  had killed the guy.  That's a foolish thing to do.  That's one thing.  You don't make admissions against  interest.  What I did was explain how to kill  someone that way.  If you take your finger and put it  to the side of your neck, there's a  hollow there.  You know that little hollow?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you slide a knife down there. 
[01:22:00]  You rock it this way and that way.  And the heart's sliced and, you  know, they're gone.  I've heard you a lot of time, I've  heard you being questioned about  killing and stuff.  And he never fesses up to that  because there's no statute of  limitations on killing.  Exactly right.  So he never fesses up.  The big S you see up here does not  stand for simple.  How many, though?  Just give us a little.  He's never going to fess up to that.  Mr. Liddy, fight back.  Especially on national radio, you  know.  Yeah.  Hello. 
[01:22:30]  Fight back, tackling terrorism,  Liddy style.  Kyle, one thing that your average  American can do, probably what would  you consider the most important thing  that the average American or American  family can do to protect themselves in  this day and age?  Well, I'll tell you, I'll give you one  and then we'll see if Jim has one.  He may have the same.  I mean, the first thing is you've got  to have a plan.  If you don't have a plan and something  happens, it's too late then, you know, 
[01:23:00]  to try to plan because you won't be  properly equipped or anything.  You have to have a plan.  I hate to pick it apart, but what's the  most important part of a family's plan  against a terrorist attack?  I mean...  Well, go ahead, Jim.  Well, first of all, I think is be aware  of what the attack is.  If it was a bio event, if it was a  chemical event, or if it's an explosion  or something else of that nature.  Because your plan or what you're going  to respond and how you're going to  respond depends on what the attack  was.  So should you have bio suits in your 
[01:23:30]  closet?  I mean, is that...  Where is protecting yourself and your  family and going too far where, all  right, or maybe there isn't a too far?  Well, there is.  You just have to be prudent.  But if you have a plan, if you know  it's a biological attack or it's a  chemical attack, you might want to be  sheltering in place.  And that's...  You want to have enough resources at the  house, canned foods and plenty of water  and that sort of thing until the plume  goes by and it's okay to go back out  again.  And these things will happen quickly if  that's the attack. 
[01:24:00]  So the first and most important thing is  with the plan is to understand what the  attack is and how to respond.  It's no longer a fire drill, hey, get out  of the house and go out in the front yard.  It's no longer like that.  Another thing you might prudently do is  get yourself vaccinated against smallpox.  Now, just picture this.  These guys don't care if they die.  You know, if you're willing to blow  yourself up, you're willing to let  yourself be infected with smallpox. 
[01:24:30]  Now, you are virulently contagious, but  there's no way to tell for days and days.  And you put them on a plane.  Now you infect 100 people on a plane.  Those people go out and infect those  people like that and it's just horrendous.  Yeah, when was the last time people  were inoculated?  Yeah, I mean, I was inoculated, but it  was so long ago that it's doubtful that  it would save me.  Yeah, I was as well. 
[01:25:00]  And obviously I'm much younger.  And it's no longer...  You for other reasons.  It's probably going places where, you  know, we don't inoculate them for all  kinds of stuff.  That's another story.  We could try to make them talk.  We do have mousetraps up.  Somebody kneel stuck in me.  Yeah.  But yeah, the inoculations now are no  good against the new strains.  Great.  Another thing I got to worry about.  They always goof on me around the show.  He's a germaphobe.  No, I'm the kind of batting down the  hatches at the house, kind of don't want 
[01:25:30]  to be a victim of a home invasion.  Guy, Long Island, I live out in  Nassau County and there's been a lot  of these home invasions.  I hope you've got a firearm.  I believe me, Mr. Liddy.  You'd be proud, Mr. Liddy.  I've picked up a couple of wonderful  items from Wilson Firearms, one of  which is my 12-gauge that sits next to  the bed.  And another one, a little fun down at  the range, is the AR-15, which I just  love.  The EOTech site that you guys must be  very familiar with.  Yeah.  I love the holographic site.  Remember that you need sufficient loaded 
[01:26:00]  guns in the house, placed strategically so  that the bad guys can never get between  you and the gun.  Right.  Hey, call Liddy a nut, OB, Jimmy.  Liddy has a reason to think that way.  You live on Long Island and do  impressions.  Smart ass.  She's always got to nail me.  I'm sitting here thinking, I can't even  imagine having G. Gordon Liddy as your  father.  Yeah, that's got to be something. 
[01:26:30]  Was that a crazy upbringing or what?  That was unique.  Yeah.  That was unique, yeah.  Were you ever really scared of him?  No.  When you were going through your...  No, a very loving father.  Yeah, but I mean, you know...  Just dad to him.  Get your ass out there and become a  Navy SEAL.  Yeah, that kind of must be a little bit  of pressure.  But I want to be a shark jock.  I kind of wanted to be a florist.  Actually, what he wanted to be was a  drummer.  He's got a hell of a good drum set.  Oh, really?  He's damn good at it, yeah.  Must be good at interrogations. 
[01:27:00]  Just play his head.  When did dad say the drumming thing?  It's cute, but...  Yeah.  Actually, I didn't really...  I'm looking for you to do bigger and  better things.  Actually, when I started, he was in  prison, so it didn't bother him at  all.  Yeah.  Wow.  How old were you when that  happened?  I was 11 when he went in and 17 when  he came out.  Wow.  Man, did you visit a lot?  Yeah, but he was in what, 12  different prisons?  Yeah.  I used to get thrown out of prison.  Did you?  Yeah.  I mean, it was the warden of one  prison whose father had been a  warden.  It was a maximum security prison, and 
[01:27:30]  I got transferred in there because  they said that I had shut down  another prison with a strike, you  know, by myself, which was not true  because I had to help.  At any rate, he put me immediately  in the hole and said, I will not let  this man be in the general population  of this prison.  He is far too dangerous.  And then, you know, we got a writ to  get me out of there, and he wouldn't  put me in the general population.  He transferred me again.  Yeah, they probably don't want a  guy like you spouting off to the  population.  Well, you know, it's not, you know,  but see, I knew how vulnerable 
[01:28:00]  He's probably sitting there in the  yard going, you know how easy it is  to break out of this place?  All right, people.  No, you know, but what it would be  is, you know, I got in there, and I  looked around, and I said, you know,  there's a tremendous criminal talent  pool here.  All it needs is organization and  leadership.  Yeah, and that's what they don't  want.  Not unlike the Manson thinking.  There's going to be a war, and the  blacks will take over, and then  there's going to be one white guy  to leave.  That was Manson's thought process.  All right, here's a picture that 
[01:28:30]  they might goof on me with.  Why can't a guy take a picture  proudly with some of his goods  around the house?  Those look like perfectly good  firearms.  I mean, I put out a calendar every  year with girls posing like that.  Well, you know, I just wanted to  show the guys here what I do with  the house.  It'll be part of your calendar.  Those are fun down at the range.  You go shooting down at the range.  I think you actually showed that to  these guys to keep them in line. 
[01:29:00]  You're right.  Yeah.  You've got to let them know what you  got, but not everything you got.  As a Navy SEAL, do you find that  pose intimidating?  No.  That's not the way he would.  You're going to take me out in a  second.  Perfect positioning for the purse to  hang on to.  Look at me.  That's a Dick Cheney pose right  there.  Let's go to John in Alabama.  John.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Jimmy, what's up, sweet box?  Hey, man.  G. Gordon, I had the pleasure of 
[01:29:30]  seeing you speak at Virginia  Military Institute.  Oh, yeah.  Graduation a few years ago.  And, man, you said something that  day that I swear that it's  absolutely was chilling, and it  still kind of freaks me out.  And I was hoping maybe you'd  comment on it again.  You were talking, and you said  something was when all the shit  was going down, and you said,  man, you just tell me which  street corner to stand on.  And I heard that, and it  absolutely kind of really still  kind of freaks me out.  So I don't know if you remember 
[01:30:00]  that.  Yeah, well, I remember it,  because when I'm just being  logical, now look, I had in my  head knowledge which could  you know, like within 24 hours  bring down the entire  government of the United States.  And people have been killed  for a lot less, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Now, it seemed to me that if  they decided to do that, I  certainly didn't want somebody  sticking a shotgun in the  kitchen window, and they not 
[01:30:30]  only take me out, you know,  take out my wife and some of  the kids or something like  that.  So I said, look, if you want to  go that route, just let me know,  and I'll go to some convenient  remote corner someplace.  Wow.  And I was just protecting my  family.  That's all.  Yeah.  Why didn't they kill you?  I mean, you did have this  information.  Well, I think they realized that  I would not talk.  I never did.  Well, you didn't.  And there's something hidden  somewhere.  There's something hidden 
[01:31:00]  somewhere.  What do you think?  Do you think there's still  Watergate secrets?  Are there any more secrets?  No, everything's been out,  right?  Yeah.  And I think I'm assuming  anyway, based on what I know  this way, it's out, but most  people don't know it.  Most people have no idea what  Watergate was all about.  And all the evidence and, you  know, that proves exactly what  it was all about and everything  is on file in a United States  District Court clerk's office  or anything.  But the press didn't even want 
[01:31:30]  to report it because it is not  the conventional wisdom.  Did you know who Deep Throat  was before he...  Deep Throat was and remains  a composite.  It was not...  Look at this.  Mark Felt, the one they are  claiming now, he was the guy  and everything.  If you look at the book that  they wrote, they say Deep  Throat said that they are  destroying, you know, the tapes  and so on and so forth.  Mark Felt hadn't been in the  FBI, it wasn't in the FBI for 
[01:32:00]  months before that happened.  He was no longer in a position  to have that information.  They had a whole bunch of  different people who were  giving them information and  they created what was a very  effective literary device.  You know, they lumped it all  in one, call them Deep Throat  and it worked.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Someone's got to die.  Oh, no. 
[01:32:30]  Who's calling G. Gordon Liddy?  Oh, no.  It's probably the most  innocent of calls.  More importantly, that cell phone  ring is not the tone you'd  expect to be on his phone.  It came with the device.  It came with the device.  It had a Mission Impossible  theme or something come out of  there.  Not that.  I'll put it on vibrate.  Usually only women put it on  vibrate.  Oh, boy.  Mike the Cobb.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  Mike's in the same league as  you guys, by the way.  He protects Madonna. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, uh...  True story, by the way.  Hey, Gordon.  Yeah?  I was just listening.  I tuned in late.  What's your son's background?  I was listening.  I just caught the end of it.  He's right here.  He's right here.  He was a captain of the United  States Olympic Team South one  year in the 1980s for the  Modern Pentathlon, and he was  the All-Navy Modern Pentathlon  champion, and then he was the  next time for a water polo, and  became a SEAL, volunteered for the  SEAL training, became a SEAL, and 
[01:33:30]  spent 20 years as a SEAL commando  serving in 37 different countries.  What's a pentathlon?  I mean, the modern pentathlon is  jumping horses, riding skills,  dueling with the epé, shooting, and  swimming, isn't it?  And running.  And running, yeah.  It's being a man, Jim.  Look into it.  Is checkers included?  I'd love to join.  Right now, he's the chief executive  officer of an outfit called Red Cell 
[01:34:00]  Associates, and what they do is,  for major industries, big  corporations, and what have you,  what he used to do for the  United States government, which  was test the efficiency of the  protection of national assets of  the United States all over the  world.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, it's big business right now.  Hey, old, can you get me his  information?  What's that?  Huh?  Can you guys get me his  information?  I'm kind of in the same business.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Hold on, Mike.  Sure.  Just a piece of paper?  He's on hold.  Yeah, we'll get him the info. 
[01:34:30]  We'll take care of him.  All right.  Well, G. Gordon Liddy, Fight Back,  Tackling Terrorism, the new book  out there.  Loved having you on, man.  Amen to some.  You are a legend.  Jim wrote the book, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  If you knew what he'd been doing  for 20 years, he'd be the legend.  Well, he's got time to be a legend.  Right now, you're the legend.  Sometimes it's a pain in the ass  being a legend.  Oh, tell me about it.  I know. 
[01:35:00]  You know how it is to drive  through the transgendered community?  Well.  And I never take pictures  with anybody that comes in here,  but I would love a picture  with G. Gordon Liddy.  You got it.  If you've got a camera.  Great, man.  I was hoping he'd say no.  Very good.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  And we'll continue in just a bit.  I got to say, I think Master Poe was humbled a little bit today. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  I saw the discussion going on  between G. Gordon Liddy's son, James,  and Master Poe.  They were talking out the window,  and me and Jimmy were laughing.  Like, I bet they're discussing  how they could use that CD case  to take out a village.  I go to Master Poe.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I go, you know,  just imagine how many guys 
[01:36:00]  those two have killed between themselves.  Oh.  Please.  I bet you Paul and him.  Go ahead.  Sorry, James.  I bet you they were having  a completely non-lethal discussion.  Yeah, Poe, what were you guys discussing out there?  How do you feel about a doily in the living room?  Well, I don't care for it  because it takes away from the drapes.  What was the discussion out there?  Well, he was explaining  that he traveled all over the world  and that he's trained thousands of people.  And you brought up the fact  that you did a little training yourself  down there at Quantico? 
[01:36:30]  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  Did you discuss anything  about techniques on killing people?  No, they discussed that over the air.  I think that was enough.  You tell them about the sticks  and the knives and the fighting?  No.  Dojo?  It was an honor to have him here,  to have both of them here.  And that's something?  And it was just all good.  I enjoyed it.  Does he know karate, his son?  I didn't ask him.  Of martial arts?  Probably does.  I didn't ask him.  But he was in the seals.  That guy could kill you  with a paper clip.  Special forces.  Yep.  Okay, so.  Black ops.  Yeah, so.  That's some good shit, man.  That says it all. 
[01:37:00]  Were you humble today?  Very humbled.  All right.  I'd like to hear that.  Extremely humbled.  Are you kidding?  I'd like to hear that.  Very good, Poe.  Us, gentlemen.  Back to your post.  Thank you.  Yeah, we were just discussing.  That was a thrill for us.  I got a hand to Anthony.  That was a great interview.  I love the G. Gordon Liddy, man.  I've been a fan for years.  The shit you know, though,  it sickens me.  It really is awful.  Only Anthony would know  that Howard Hughes was involved  with getting a Russian sub back  with G. Gordon Liddy.  Operation Jennifer.  Oops.  What was that?  Oops.  Operation Jennifer. 
[01:37:30]  Great.  We got to go into  Anthony's bank account  and extract thousands of dollars.  Too bad her alimony payment  wasn't in the Russian sub.  Yeah, please.  The payment?  I can think of something  better in the sub.  And then we're talking about,  can you imagine being,  you know,  G. Gordon Liddy's son?  You know that guy  wanted to play the drums  for a living.  Who doesn't want to be  in a rock band?  You know,  G. Gordon Liddy's like,  yeah, he was a good drummer.  And you got to think,  the guy, you know,  was thinking ahead,  going,  I'll be a drummer  in some great rock band  someday.  And G. Gordon Liddy's like, 
[01:38:00]  yeah, yeah, that's cute.  But, you know,  I was special ops, dude.  See, when daddy's  a secret agent,  the son doesn't  become a drummer.  Now get your ass  into the military  and start your  illustrious career.  You're not playing  the drums  unless it's on  some Iraqi's head  to get information  out of it.  Dad, I want to be  like Johnny Ware.  Oh, God.  No.  His worst nightmare, right?  The bad boy  of figure skating.  You got to think  that's G. Gordon Liddy's  worst nightmare.  Oh, well, 
[01:38:30]  thank God for G. Gordon.  It didn't turn out  that way.  That son's a badass.  Yeah.  That's some career.  20 years in the SEALs.  All the countries  he's seen,  what he must have done.  Keeping the country  safe, those guys.  It's all that secret shit.  A lot of these  congressmen,  a lot of the public,  they want to know  everything.  They want to know  everything the government's  doing.  There's a segment  that should just be  left unknown to us. 
[01:39:00]  Very valuable.  And you look at  G. Gordon Liddy's son  and you go,  all right, yeah,  do whatever you want.  I trust you.  Whatever you need to do.  He has that look like  I trust you.  He has that look like,  yeah, I don't even  need to question you.  He's going to do  the right thing  for this country.  That's right.  That's all you need to know.  That's all I need to know.  Because he was quiet.  He was very soft-spoken.  Those are the guys  that will just,  yeah,  as they're chit-chatting,  putting you in a fucking  rifle scope.  When he's sitting there,  just very quiet  and going,  yes, this is what we do.  And where was that  moment in time 
[01:39:30]  where he jammed that knife  down that guy's neck  and twisted  in a jungle somewhere  in South America?  Not only have those guys  seen some shit  and killed people,  in my opinion,  they sleep like babies.  Oh,  not a problem snoozing.  Not even a hint  of a nightmare ever.  Because they know  every single one  of those people  died for the safety  of this nation.  That's how they sleep.  All right,  let's say hi to Kelly  in New York.  Kelly.  Kelly.  Kelly?  Hi, Kelly.  What's up, Kelly? 
[01:40:00]  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I opened my paper  this morning  and there is a picture  of Lil Jimmy  on the cover.  Oh, no.  What paper?  Was it a John bust?  No, it's Times Herald Record.  The what?  Times Herald Record  in Orange County, New York.  Why am I in the  Times Herald Record?  Um, I don't know.  There's a big article  about Bill Burr.  Oh, okay.  And then, like,  it's got this huge picture  of Bill Burr  with a mousetrap next to it.  Does it really?  Yeah.  That's a little wacky, huh?  Well, that's not me.  That's Bill Burr.  There's no photo of me 
[01:40:30]  in there.  I've seen the article.  Yeah, there is.  No, this is just  the online version.  Oh.  So there might be.  Yeah, there's a picture  of you with some...  Is it a big paper up there?  Yeah.  It's the biggest one.  All right.  So we're getting  some good press.  That's in the Poughkeepsie area,  I'm assuming?  Yeah, Orange County,  Middlesbrough.  Because Bill Burr's  playing Bananas tonight  in Poughkeepsie.  Right.  And then it says  Jim Norton is playing  Comedy Works in Albany.  In Albany.  Okay.  Oh, next week.  Yeah, but let's...  Sorry, sorry.  I wasn't paying  much attention there. 
[01:41:00]  Why?  Sorry.  What happened?  Oh, a couple of people  decided they were  going to IM me  and say how boring  the interview was,  how be more funny,  tell more jokes,  and those people  not getting bounced  from the room.  Instant ban.  I've instantly banned them.  So whoever,  if you're listening now,  if you can listen,  and you IM'd me,  you will be getting  instantly banned,  which means  in 24 hours  you can't return  to the room.  Yeah.  You feeling all right?  You should take 
[01:41:30]  your temperature.  You all right?  Help me.  Insta ban.  No, don't ban them.  No, no, no.  Ban.  Absolute ban.  You know I'm not  going to look at that  and when we're working  hard over here  and interviewing a man  like G Gordon Liddy  and look at  Be More Funny  and Boring,  they instantly get banned  from the room.  They will never again  set foot in  Opie and Anthony  live on Pal Talk.  We have some people  that are dummies  that listen to this program.  Some. 
[01:42:00]  And now they will be banned.  Because there's other people  often get some feedback  going,  this shows the diversity  of the program.  Well, that's somebody  with half a brain.  I'm happy when you guys  go in different directions.  Right.  It was still funny,  Jimmy trying to be a man  in front of G Gordon's son.  That's hysterical right there.  My name was Jim  and his name was Jim.  That's where all similarity ended.  I bet you my father  would love to swap  with G Gordon.  Yeah.  Like, I'll take your kid  and you take my fat-titted  dick joke artist.  Why don't you tell him  about Operation Monster Rain? 
[01:42:30]  You slither under  an enemy porch suddenly.  There's a hoot.  There's a hoot.  You take the enemy's assets  into your mouth.  Oh, balls smell like mothballs.  I'll never forget that  when I was fucking third grade.  Callie.  Yes.  So it's a good article, huh?  Yeah, it's a really nice article  about you guys.  And then the picture  has Jim Norton  looking at this  transsexual's boobs.  Oh.  Oh, which tranny? 
[01:43:00]  What's the picture?  Which tranny?  The caption says,  Nice.  Comedian actor Jim Norton  poses with transsexual  entertainer vanity  at the Defiance films.  Oh, that was at the  porn awards.  At the, uh...  Okay, yeah, that was...  Of course it was.  Yeah, and then there's  a picture of...  It was a White House dinner.  What picture  they use of us?  Uh, the one  in front of the XM sign.  Ugh.  There's a couple of that.  Hey, could you mail us  a couple copies  of that paper?  Of course I could.  Can they give her  the address off there  so she can mail  a couple hard copies of it?  Yeah, definitely.  And the article's up  on opianantony.com. 
[01:43:30]  It really is a great article.  It's wonderful.  Thanks, Mrs.  And I gotta tell ya,  um, you know,  we have a...  We're fortunate enough  to have a lot of articles  written about us  and there's always  stuff that's wrong.  This one was almost perfect.  Almost.  I would say...  Almost.  I had a little problem.  I would say  it was 95% accurate.  95% accurate  and then the guy  made a huge mistake.  Well, there's one little thing.  I read the whole article  and it was very good.  Very accurate.  Very nice. 
[01:44:00]  See, this guy  actually did his research  and explained why  we're much, much different  than Howard Stern.  Mm-hmm.  He talks about this show  being a virus.  He's familiar with the show.  And our fans are pests.  You know, he got  a lot of stuff right.  Got the comics  comics that we get on board.  Right.  How we have fun.  Yeah.  Cringe humor.  Things like that.  But there's one little thing  I had a little problem with.  You want me to read 
[01:44:30]  the whole first paragraph?  Yeah, might as well.  When a radio show's  increasing popularity  is described as a virus,  the listeners are referred  to as pests  and the hosts have been fired  from two previous jobs  for offensive material,  well, then,  it's just another day  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony Cumia,  one half of the infamous  radio team,  described his radio show  to a guest recently.  And I quote,  I'll tell you where  the line isn't,  Cumia says.  We've made light 
[01:45:00]  of Adam Walsh's head  on this program.  Jesus Christ.  Go ahead.  You want to start  spinning that one,  please?  I really can help  this out, please.  Watch this.  The guy kind of  went against  why I said that.  I didn't say it  like that.  I said  the line isn't 
[01:45:30]  anywhere  because  there's a context  for everything.  No matter how tragic,  we've talked about  some horrid tragedies  on this show  in a comedic vein.  It's black comedy,  dark comedy.  We've discussed  other child deaths  under certain  circumstances,  in certain context.  This is  black comedy. 
[01:46:00]  it's so awful  that it comes  full circle  and through  its awfulness  and your nervousness  and the horror  of the whole thing,  the unrealness  of it,  there is humor  there to be found  somewhere  in the proper  context.  So in what context  would the  humor  Here's the follow-up  question.  I can't even say it,  of this situation.  Adam Walsh's head?  Yeah,  in what context 
[01:46:30]  would that people go,  oh, I get it.  I get it.  I need to laugh here.  You know something?  I don't know.  I don't know if it's come up.  It probably has  and we probably  have used it.  But the way  he printed it here  is like  it would come up  for any reason  and just because  it's horrible  that's why  we would use it.  There is,  believe it or not,  a context  where any horrible  thing can be used  in a comedic light.  It happens.  People,  you know,  there are people  making 9-11 jokes 
[01:47:00]  out there.  The day after it happened,  I don't think they were.  Titanic,  you know,  that was a horrible  tragedy when it happened.  Fast forward a few years,  it's a carnival ride  where little kids  slide down  a fucking rubber thing  named Titanic  much like  the horrified passengers  who bounced off  the stacks did.  Now little kids  are playing on a ride  called the Titanic.  In certain contexts,  tragedies  can become  comedy.  So you're not saying  this guy didn't 
[01:47:30]  throw anybody  into the bus,  he just kind of,  the way he wrote it  might be misconstrued.  He left out  the important part  is that I,  the way I told him  Well,  we didn't even talk  to this guy.  Yeah.  But what I was telling  a guest is  that there isn't  a line  because anything  might come up  in the right context  and find itself  as comedy  to be funny.  And I used  a very extreme  example  of that  because you couldn't  possibly find humor  in that. 
[01:48:00]  Yet,  we can't put a line  there  because under  some circumstance  somewhere,  unbeknownst to me  right now,  it may be found.  Way to head off  that follow-up question.  Way to put the  kibosh.  I would have  taken the fifth  myself.  No,  I'm hitting the stand.  Well,  the guy that wrote  the article  is on the line,  Jermaine.  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  What's up,  Jermaine?  I gotta tell you,  Bell Pepper.  Laugh, 
[01:48:30]  you fuck.  I gotta tell you,  I Google Opie and  Anthony every morning  to see what's being  written about us  and I really,  really enjoyed  your article.  Well,  I'm a fan of the show  and anything I can do  would help the program.  But Anthony,  alright,  I had to come up  with the most  horrific thing  to draw people  into the article  and because I couldn't  get an interview  with you guys,  that's what I picked.  Yeah,  we did turn down  interview requests  with good old Jermaine.  Hey,  what do,  how do you say  your first name?  Jermaine.  The goddamn Germans  got nothing to do with it. 
[01:49:00]  You look a lot taller  in the newspaper.  Yeah,  well,  that's the reason  I know it  and I mean,  I mentioned that  Opie says we're  brilliant broadcasters  and use the sarcasm.  I tried to,  you know,  explain the contact.  Wait,  let me see what you said  about brilliant broadcasters here.  Like,  when I read that,  I was like,  wow,  the guy really gets it.  Bill Burr,  good friend of the show  and regular guest  will never forget  that mousetrap segment  that they did.  That's one of those things  that when I think about it,  I have to go take a shower, 
[01:49:30]  says Burr during a phone interview.  The side of the show  that doesn't get a lot of publicity,  though,  is there's a lot of sharp,  really smart,  observational humor on there.  On a regular basis,  Opie,  Greg Hughes,  says on the air,  we're brilliant broadcasters.  A statement that he heaps  with his signature sarcasm.  Then again,  it might be true.  The duo surrounds itself  with some of the best comedians  on the planet,  all of whom are able  to survive an in-studio atmosphere  that Burr describes  as comedy boot camp.  That list runs like  a who's who of comedy.  Brian Regan,  Stephen Lynch,  Dean Cook,  Rich Voss is a who-who name. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, boy.  A who's who name.  Patrice O'Neill,  Ralphie May,  Jay Moore,  and others.  They really have a good eye  as far as the people  they've brought in,  Burr says.  I mean,  the guys they are rotating through  are pretty much  the top guys out there right now.  So you combine that  with Anthony's sense of humor  or Opie's Rain Man ability  to keep the show moving  and it just all works out.  That was a very good observation there.  Thank you.  There's other good observations  in the next paragraph.  Oh.  Oh, uh-oh.  Yeah, but we want to do 
[01:50:30]  other things on the show today,  so I figured we would just kind of...  All right,  how about we all...  All right,  why don't you read the part  that makes you look good?  Because I read the part  that made us look good.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I don't really find a part  that makes me...  All right.  Yes, you do.  The main lifeblood of the show  is comic Jim Norton.  Norton is...  Wait.  What?  It doesn't say that.  Oh.  Oh, no.  It's just...  I'm paraphrasing. 
[01:51:00]  It says...  I'll read it, Jimmy.  Chief among those comics  is Jim Norton.  Norton is the third leg  of the ONA tripod,  a daily presence  and the person  that Burr and others  occasionally fill in for.  New York Magazine  once called Norton  The Golden Child  in a new wave  of rough and tumble stand-ups.  And CringeHumor.com  touts him as  the king of the cringe style.  It's .net.  That's my only criticism.  Okay.  Norton learned the ropes  opening for Andrew Dice Clay  in his heyday  and met ONA through Dice.  Norton's humor,  which is just about 
[01:51:30]  as raunchy and offensive  as one can imagine  immediately meshed with the show.  He's been on ever since.  Norton regularly entertains  and berates listeners  with statements such as,  I hope you get into  a drunk driving accident  on New Year's Eve.  He jokes about child murder,  his penchant for properties,  all right, funny man.  All right, funny man.  What child murder  have you joked about?  The question is,  what haven't I?  Exactly.  Little Yates kids,  little JonBenet Ramsey.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Who are the other little kids?  Connor Peterson.  Connor Peterson.  Connor Peterson.  Little Lisa.  Who are the two that backed into the...  Susan Smith.  Susan Smith.  Right.  It goes on.  I think the way I fit into that show  is I'm like Cringe Light Burr says.  If I sat down with Jim Norton  and started trading stories,  I'd be done in about three stories.  Jim's a little more colorful than I am.  Let's put it that way.  So it's a really good article, Jermaine.  All right, thanks, guys.  Anthony just wishes  you would have explained  that line a little bit better.  Yeah, because it's all about the context. 
[01:52:30]  That was my point  more than saying there isn't a line  because a line can't be made  unless you explain the context of it, you know?  No, I understand,  but I was trying to be shocking.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  All right.  So, yeah, I'm coming up to Poughkeepsie  sometime in April, I think.  I mentioned that in the article.  I scooped it.  Thank you.  And Bill Burr's going to be at Bananas tonight.  Go support Bill Burr.  Yes, tonight and tomorrow, right? 
[01:53:00]  Correct.  Two tonight, two tomorrow.  Bill is a really, really funny stand-up.  It's a really long article.  It's a very good article.  It's well-written,  and I think we have it on opianethony.com.  Yes, it is.  It talks about the differences  between us and Stern.  I really appreciate that  because a lot of reporters,  they just go,  ah, shock jocks,  ah, clones,  ah, this, ah, that,  instead of doing their own research  and trying to, you know,  get to the bottom  of what we do here  on a daily basis.  So, thank you for that.  You're welcome, guys.  Keep it going.  Maybe we'll talk  before Poughkeepsie, sir. 
[01:53:30]  I think I'm going to try  to arrange that, Mr. Norton.  Bye, Mr. Norton.  Great job.  Great job.  Jermaine, one other question.  Gerald.  One person in the media  that likes us.  Yeah, and you had to do that.  You had to hang up on him.  Did you have to do that?  Yes, I had to.  We got lots of problems  in this room.  He's a good boy.  Yes.  Yeah, that was good.  It wasn't, uh,  the guy obviously  informed about the show  listens. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, hold on.  I want this guy  to kiss her ass  for a little bit.  Bill in Jersey,  what's up?  I wanted to thank you  two patriots.  You guys defending  the First Amendment  constantly,  and once again this morning  bringing on somebody  like G. Gordon Liddy  to remind us  of our patriotic duties.  I enjoyed that segment.  It was great.  I love Liddy.  Oh, absolutely.  It's not going to be  all dick jokes,  ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Punching out, guys.  Thanks.  I really enjoyed  listening to Anthony  talk to G. Gordon Liddy.  The first hour  of this show  was talking about 
[01:54:30]  our staff  showing their ball bags  in front of a camera  to hundreds of people.  So what Anthony's saying  is we got the political stuff,  we got the hotness.  We had to balance out  the program.  Yeah, to balance that out,  believe me,  we needed G. Gordon Liddy.  Once again,  a couple things.  Bill Burr,  Bananas, Poughkeepsie  tonight and tomorrow,  and also he's on  Letterman tonight.  Oh, is he doing Letterman?  He probably taped it Monday, right?  He taped it Monday,  and he's very happy  with his set. 
[01:55:00]  Bill's on Letterman tonight?  Yeah, make sure  we get a copy of that  so we can play it on Monday.  That's very cool.  And speaking of  the First Amendment  and freedom of speech,  we have a Club Soda Kenny  not really an update,  but another news report.  Oh, boy.  This one is great.  This is a First Amendment case.  I went over it  in my chambers  and decided  this is a First Amendment case.  Yeah.  I think what Kenny does  off hours on his job,  even though technically  you're on the job  24 hours a day,  is his own business. 
[01:55:30]  Didn't hurt.  I think they ought to look  to see if it affected  his job in any way,  and it did not.  Can I say I was talking  to a friend of mine  who was a First Amendment lawyer,  and we were chatting  about Kenny's case,  and she was saying  that the porn guy  who called in that day  really annoyed her  because he was ill-informed.  A regular job  may have that type of crap  where they could  throw you off for nothing.  She said,  but when you work  for the government,  there's other considerations,  so he has a better case  because he works  for the government.  I could see  if what he was doing 
[01:56:00]  was in any way  affecting his job.  Right.  But he was a very good cop.  No one argued that.  His supervisor even said  he gave 22 years of service  on the police force  and did a very good job.  So it's what he's doing  on his off hours,  not getting paid for it.  It's a verbal release.  Well, he's been suspended  without pay.  He might lose his pension.  It starts to get ugly,  I think, next week.  It's an ongoing story.  And the news is all over it. 
[01:56:30]  All over it.  Like Club Soda Kenny  becoming a star  in front of our eyes.  I'm a martyr.  And his lawyer,  I guess he's good  at what he does,  but he doesn't know  how to speak that well  to the media.  No, not one of these  flashy Johnny Cochran types?  No, he might want  to take a class.  Oh, no.  I don't even want  to spoil it for you guys.  Oh, no.  Just listen to what he says.  Oh, no.  In this clip,  there's a couple things  he got wrong.  Great.  All right, here it is. 
[01:57:00]  The latest news report  on our pal,  Club Soda Kenny.  A local police department  isn't joking  when it comes to moonlighting.  Officials say  one cop's comedy act  is no laughing matter.  He's been suspended  without pay  and could face  departmental charges.  Giovanna Derpick  joins us now  with more, Giovanna.  Brenda, for nearly 25 years,  Sergeant John Fetter  has been a cop.  And for most of that time,  he's also performed comedy  as Club Soda Kenny.  But one eight-minute  stand-up act  may wipe out  his entire career  in law enforcement.  This whole situation 
[01:57:30]  is very disheartening  to me.  This whole situation  is very disheartening  to me.  Look, I know  this is a serious thing.  I know Club Soda Kenny  listens every day  and we love the guy  and we hope it works out for him.  We adore Club Soda Kenny.  We really do.  We'll do just about  anything for him.  But you gotta laugh.  But it's just the way  he talks.  Right.  Kind of.  And the  No Laughing Matter  intro,  that's now how many?  Three or four news stories 
[01:58:00]  we've heard so far?  Yeah.  Every single one of them  has started  with that  No Laughing Matter.  I think.  They stink.  Can we go  and maybe pull  the beginnings  of all those  if it's true  that they all start  like that?  It's No Laughing Matter.  No Laughing Matter.  No Laughing Matter.  I want to hear  each one of them.  The Last Laugh.  Ugh.  Is No Laughing Matter.  Is that like  the panda story?  They always go  a pandemonium  broke out at the zoo today.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Ugh.  Die.  Here it is.  Your career  in law enforcement.  This whole situation  is very disheartening  to me.  Sergeant John Fetter's  day job as a cop  and night job  as a comedian  has come to  a disastrous collision.  And it's all  because someone  anonymously sent  an email and CD  to dozens of  West Orange leaders.  It was a recording  of a stand-up act  last December  from the Laugh Factory's  raunchy cringe humor show.  This routine  involved  different comedy acts  pertaining to 
[01:59:00]  bestiology,  pedophilia.  Bestiology.  Bestiology.  Bestiology.  Can you take that  class in high school?  That's his lawyer?  Bestiology 101.  Bestiology.  His lawyer,  Opie Hughes,  said.  Bestiology.  Last December  from the Laugh Factory's  raunchy cringe humor show. 
[01:59:30]  This routine  involved  different comedy acts  pertaining to  bestiology,  pedophilia,  and assault.  Peter Berggren  is Sergeant Fetter's  attorney.  He acknowledges that  as part of the act,  Fetter even made a joke  about rape involving  his five-year-old son.  But he says Fetter  was just giving the audience  the kind of humor  they were looking for.  He's an entertainer.  It doesn't mean  that John Fetter  believes in that.  It doesn't mean  that John Fetter  would ever commit  those kind of deeds. 
[02:00:00]  But the West Orange  Police Department  thinks his act,  joke or otherwise,  crossed the line  and slapped him  with an administrative  charge of conduct  unbecoming of an officer.  Based on the content  of that email  and the CD,  we made a decision  to suspend  Officer Fetter  immediately pending  an internal affairs  investigation.  I would call that  persecution,  vindictive persecution.  A confidential source  says Fetter's  off-color humor,  even though he was  off-duty,  cast the police department  in a negative light.  Berggren says Fetter's 
[02:00:30]  First Amendment  right to freedom  of expression  is being violated  and has damaged  the decorated officer's  reputation  and hurt his family.  It has completely  destroyed him  knowing that he's  being punished,  ostracized,  and disciplined  for committing  an act  of entertainment.  By the way,  Fetter never identified  himself as a cop  in his act.  And all this comes  just seven months  before he'd be  eligible for retirement.  He'll find out by April  if he'll be stripped  of his badge  or his pension. 
[02:01:00]  Ostracized.  Oh my god,  that lawyer.  Oh, Kenny.  I hope he's good.  I hope the guy,  like,  what is he,  no Jedi mind trick?  Get someone else  who's better spoken  like Twitchels.  This guy's a boob.  P-steology.  This guy's on  a no-R's diet.  P-steology.  This guy's an E-tod.  There's the latest  one on Kenny  as this story 
[02:01:30]  continues to grow.  Yeah,  the hearing is  next week  and we'll see  what happens.  Wow.  P-steology.  That's terrific.  Hi,  where from  are drunk?  That's a message  I'm getting  from Start Sam.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Reno.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Who's in Mississippi?  Reno,  what's up?  Not a mocho.  Just want to tell you guys  I love the show.  Jimmy,  you're great.  Oh,  thanks a lot,  man.  I appreciate the call.  But I had to 
[02:02:00]  stay up  and watch  three fucking  figure skaters  just to see  what that fag  Johnny Weir  looked like  after hearing  the replay  last night.  My wife looks at me  and he had on  more makeup  than her last night.  It was just  rough.  We called him  Johnny Queer.  Johnny Weir.  Johnny Weir.  And then in parentheses  put,  but dressed.  Well,  he's the bad boy  of figure skating.  God,  oh my God.  Did you hear  what happened  to the bad boy  of figure skating? 
[02:02:30]  What happened to him?  He missed  the bus.  Oops.  That's a rebel.  He came in,  what,  fifth place  last night?  Yeah,  yeah.  The one guy  that was actually  married  looked like  he had been  in a couple  of fights.  He actually  won the thing.  But the little  fag,  he was dressed  in the swan  outfit and the  whole bit.  It just looked  rough.  It was just  a makeup  beyond all  recognition.  Sorry, 
[02:03:00]  I'm watching  the female  curling competition.  It's really  heating up.  what excitement  is on our  television today.  How do you  fucking find  a chick  or anybody  that does  this shit?  Stop.  It's heating up,  man.  I mean,  it's anyone's  game at this point.  This is an  awful,  it's anyone's  could go  either way.  It's very  obvious.  Wow.  I'm hanging  here.  I'm hanging  on the edge.  This is just  like watching  Olympic hockey,  I gotta tell  you. 
[02:03:30]  This is just  like the  technique of  the release.  I just like  the fact that  there's two  chicks with  brooms  hustling.  That kind  of works  out.  Move.  And if they  don't get it  right at the  end,  the guy  punches him  in the eye.  Sweep,  whore,  sweep,  sweep.  Now clean  it up.  I love how  they make  the chubby  ones go down  the ice and  get the real  exercise.  They have  to race  after the  rock or  whatever the  hell you  call it and  they have  to sweep  real hard.  It's a  dish.  They're  pushing a  dish and  there's two  chicks chasing  it with a  broom.  With a  broom.  Like popcorn  was spilled.  They get  the hottest  chick to  just push  the thing  off.  That's all 
[02:04:00]  she has  to do.  And then  the chubbies  have to do  all the  work.  This sport  stinks.  I have  audio that  was sent  in.  Holy shit.  Look at  that Russian.  Look at  the Russian  chick.  There's a  girl.  What a  yeah she's  definitely got  the mongoloid  hairdo going.  I got  audio of  actual curling  audio.  Wow wait a  minute not  just a visual  but we have  audio.  Swedish curling  audio sent 
[02:04:30]  in from John  and Bashar.  Swedish.  This is not a  bit.  This is the  actual audio  from the  competition.  All right.  That happened  last night.  Listen to the  excitement.  Okay.  Now what  Cassie will  have to do is  she'll have to  run it back and  hope that she  takes that one  off the  button and  rolls the one  that she raised  out of the  rings.  There is as 
[02:05:00]  much pressure  on placing  this guard  squarely where  it should be  as there is  for a draw  of a button.  This is  going to be  a little  closer.  That is not  quite on the  12 foot but  much closer  than the last  run back  attempt that  Cassie had.  Holy shit.  Which one's a  honcho? 
[02:05:30]  That's actual  audio.  Wow.  From curling.  What excitement.  It's amazing.  How did it end?  Who cares?  Hopefully in a  fucking locked  door in a  fire.  I think they're  still playing.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think they're  still doing what  they do.  I feel bad for  the guy who gets  stuck announcing  because they  probably pick  like they get  assigned like what  events they're  going to announce.  Yeah.  Everybody's  rooting for  hockey or  fucking speed  skating.  All right.  You got  curling.  Yeah.  Great.  Let's go to  Ken in South  Carolina.  We're stalling. 
[02:06:00]  We're trying to  get that Club  Sort of Kenny  stuff for you  guys.  Ken, what's  up?  Hey, good  morning, fellas.  Hey, I just  wanted to point  out the  obvious.  Sounds like  he's got  rich boss  for a  lawyer.  Yeah, Club  Sort of  Kenny.  That is  funny.  This is a  Fifth Amendment  case.  Yes.  Why?  It's a  Thirteenth  Amendment  case.  This  prohibition  must be  repealed.  He has the  right to  bore arms.  Let's go to 
[02:06:30]  Doc in  Atlanta.  Doc, what's  up?  Good morning,  guys.  Smith, you're  from BAB.  Used to  live on  Long Island.  Wow.  Yeah, a long  time ago.  It is scary that  the United States  is in a  situation that  you're the  First Amendment  poster boys  now, and  you're going to  stand up.  I was wondering  if Larry Flint's  going to be on  the show soon,  and then when  they do the  movie about  Club Soda  Kenny, who's  going to be  cast in all  the roles.  Boy, you  sure have  spread this  out into a  whole scenario,  sir.  Let me let it 
[02:07:00]  sink in.  Way to ask a  bunch of  questions, none  which are  interesting.  Let me get  to play you.  That's the  point, Norris.  Oh, good  point.  All three  questions.  That guy was  riding on  black ice, and  he thought he  was going to  make it  through.  He was  sliding.  I didn't  see it.  It was  swerving.  It looked like  the road.  Oh, my God, I  think I'm  going to make  it without  hitting into  anything.  Larry Flint,  turn out of  that bomb.  playing club  soda, Kenny.  No, turn the  other way. 
[02:07:30]  Well, turn  into the bad  joke, sir.  We should  take a break.  I like  breaks.  What's his  next year?  I got to take  a leak.  Who?  Your pal there  from MTV.  Oh, Damien.  Damien.  We were in  acting class  together.  I had no  idea he was  on MTV.  Really?  Acting class  together?  Does he act  like you?  He's actually  good.  Well, I  think so.  Does he do  that when he  acts?  Where are you  going?  Hey, well, 
[02:08:00]  I'm the  neighbor.  Actually,  Nathaniel just  pointed and  said one more  minute.  About what?  I don't know.  I guess they're  running some  club soda.  He's running  some club soda  Kenny thing  in here.  We can stretch.  Yeah, it's  Damien Fahey  from MTV,  TRL.  He's going to  join the  program in a  few minutes  here.  Let's say  hi to Terry  in Edmonton.  Terry.  Hey, how's  it going?  Hi, Terry.  Hey, man.  Just call in  to say we  love you guys  up here in  Canada.  Listen to  you every  morning and  we love  you. 
[02:08:30]  Do you  listen illegally  or on the  new Canadian  feed?  On the  new Canadian  feed.  Except  Canada.  Nice.  Yeah, we  love you guys.  We're right  here in  Edmonton,  the home of  the world's  biggest shopping  mall.  We love our  neighbors to  the north as  the Canadians  are known to  us here in  the United  States of  America.  Neighbors to  the north.  And we love  you guys because  God help us,  if anybody  ever fucked  with us.  We got you  guys on our  side.  I love when  Canadians realize  that.  Because our  army's like  three men and 
[02:09:00]  half a bunker.  You know how  much land is up  there?  Just for the  taking.  It would have  been just for  the taking of  the rest of the  world if not for  this powerful  country right  below.  It's got to be a  few acres, I'm  thinking.  It could be a  couple more than  that, Opie.  The Russian  curling chick with  the blonde hair  isn't that bad  looking.  That's what I'm  saying.  The blonde one  is always the  hot one.  But the Russian, 
[02:09:30]  not the American  one.  Why are you guys  watching curling?  Because it's  exciting.  A Canadian is  telling us that  watching curling  is stupid.  Oh, it is  stupid.  You know what?  My neighbors are  all into it trying  to get me to go  curling.  I said, that is  the fucking  stupidest thing.  Rolling a fucking  rock.  I got to ask you  something.  Do you have to go  out to a lake to  do it?  Or are there  indoor curling  places like bowling?  There's indoor  curling places all  over the fucking  place.  Like we have  bowling down here.  They would just  say, you want to  go curling tonight?  And you'd all go 
[02:10:00]  curling?  Let's get the  girls and go  curling.  That's exactly  what it is.  Wait, let me  ask you.  When they're  doing the  with the  fucking  brooms, is  that to slow  this thing  down or speed  it up?  Both, Jimmy.  And to turn  it a little bit.  That's right.  You can turn  it.  They're messing  with the ice  shavings.  They're making  the ice more  slick in the  path of it.  So if they do  it to one side  a little more,  it'll follow  that.  Or if it's  going too fast,  then they'll brush  the ice shavings  in front of this  thing.  So it slows  it down.  Why don't they  just put the  broom and let it 
[02:10:30]  hit the broom  once with a  neighbor and I  got so fucking  drunk because  they have bars  right on the  It's just like  bowling, only  with ice and  these stupid  curling things.  It looks like  they're chasing  a miscarriage  down a slip  and slide.  And fatter  chicks than  bowling.  Dude, do you  pick out the  broom thing like  you would a  pool cue at a  pool hall?  No, you know  what's funny  about that?  What?  When you're  driving by  curling...  The way you  say about in 
[02:11:00]  Canada?  What?  About it.  When you're  driving by  curling clubs  and shit,  you see these  people with  their trunks  and they're  pulling out  these brooms  and these  fancy leather  cases.  Like a pool cue  and they put  them together.  Exactly.  They have a  Minnesota  dullard.  It's the big  one.  They're all  fucking nuts  up here.  I don't  understand.  They did a  movie about it,  The Color of  Loonies.  It's Ottawa  Fats. 
[02:11:30]  Who's going to  win the gold  in hockey?  We're a long  shot.  What are we  ranked in the  world?  Sixth going  into this?  Yeah,  something like  that.  I don't know.  Canada's got to  be favored,  right?  Well, I don't  know.  Russia's the  favorite right  now.  Are they?  Yeah.  Holy shit,  do they got a  team.  Kuwait?  Everybody,  come on.  Oh,  Canada. 
[02:12:00]  That's all I  know.  You guys  know why up  here in  Canada we  don't let  Chinese play  hockey?  Why?  Because every  time they get  in the corner  of the rink,  they'd open a  grocery store.  That's a great  Canadian joke.  Like, it  doesn't really  make sense  here, but I  can tell how  funny that's  got to be up  in Canada.  But there's no  corners in a  hockey rink.  That's right,  sir.  And the amount  of time it  would take to  get a permit  for the store,  the game would  be older.  How many 
[02:12:30]  customers can  they possibly  get?  The referee  would never  allow produce  to be brought  onto the floor.  That doesn't  make sense.  And what  about the  lawsuits?  Everyone's  slipping and  trying to  pick out their  produce.  That's right.  So it's  hockey,  curling.  What's the  third sport  you guys  watch or  play?  Football.  Canadian  football.  Canadian  football.  And lacrosse.  And lacrosse,  right.  Lacrosse is our  national sport,  actually.  Are they like  Indians that  play lacrosse?  No,  there's never  an Indian  play, 
[02:13:00]  and that's  the funny  thing.  No,  really?  Eskimos?  Nope.  Just white  guys.  There's no  Eskimos in  Canada.  That's a  misconception.  It is.  Oh,  all right.  Let me  store that.  I'm sure  you will,  Anthony.  I'm sure  you will.  Do you  know one of  the hottest?  How far  are you from  Vancouver?  I almost  slipped off my  chair.  That would  have been  hysterical.  Would you  have laughed  if I cracked  my tailbone?  Paralyzed  myself talking  to a Canadian?  Vancouver's  about an  11-hour  drive. 
[02:13:30]  Okay.  We got to  let you go  because Brother  Joe's about to  start his  interview.  We love  you guys.  We love  Canada.  And thank  you for  standing on  guard for  thee.  No problem.  Thank you.  Whatever the  fuck that  means.  Bye,  fella.  We'll do  all the  heavy lifting  and what,  they're going  to stand  and watch?  Is that  what that  means?  Leave  them  alone.  Let's  say hi  to little  brothers.  Scott in  New  York.  Scott.  Scott.  Squat.  Squat.  Squat.  We just  lost  Squat.  We just  lost our  feet.  Here's  some  Club Soda  Kenny  thing.  Sergeant  John 
[02:14:00]  Fetter  was also  a guest  on the  popular  radio  show  Opie  and  Anthony.  Right  now,  News 12  New Jersey's  Michael  Weber  reports  some of  his  material  was  no  laughing  matter.  Officials  say one  cop's  comedy act  is no  laughing  matter.  A New  Jersey  cop  and  part-time  stand-up  comic  is coming  under fire  for his  raunchy  act.  But it's  no  laughing  matter.  No  laughing  matter.  No  laughing  matter.  You  fucking  assholes.  So they  all did  the same  line.  Douche  bags. 
[02:14:30]  They're  ripping me  off.  No  laughing  matter.  Tell  them,  Fred.  Wow,  do you  think the  guy's  writing the  copy for  that going  no laughing  matter?  This is  genius.  I've got to  copyright this.  No  laughing  matter.  Great,  very funny.  Yes,  Stan?  You're just  coming in  and yeah,  yeah.  You want to  show us your  ball bag like  the rest of  the staff?  No.  Why don't you  bend over and  touch your toes,  son?  All right.  I don't know  if we're going to  get Brother Joe 
[02:15:00]  on the air.  Do they have a  live feed or  anything on the  internet?  No.  Well,  that sucks.  Well,  I got to  tinkle.  Yeah,  I got to  take a leak,  man.  Let's go  together.  Me,  you,  a couple of  men taking a  piss.  Getting to know  each other.  Why not?  So what?  Derek,  all of us.  Ben's over,  he's our  inspiration.  That fucking  hornet's nest  dangling between  his legs.  Smells like  onions.  The way it  hangs down there  after he takes  a leak,  it probably  smells like  urinal cake. 
[02:15:30]  They used to  call him the  old drain  clogger in  high school.  He's going to  drown when he's  50 because  his fucking  balls get  stuck in  that thing  in the pool.  All right,  Damien Fahey  joins the  program next  from TRL  on MTV.  Roy,  we'll talk to  him about  the gay music  thing.  That we  didn't do  yesterday.  Ooh.  It's,  what is this  called again?  This week's  gay music.  All right.  Just because  he's on MTV,  that's what I'm  getting at.  Yeah,  he's not,  no.  No. 
[02:16:00]  Times have  changed.  Our kids are  getting worse.  They won't  obey their  parents.  They just  want to  fight and  curse.  Should we  blame the  government or  blame society?  Or should we  blame the  images on TV?  No,  blame  Canada.  Blame  Canada.  With all  their beady  little eyes,  clapping heads  so full of  lies.  Blame  Canada.  Blame  Canada.  We need to  form a full  assault.  You can't  get us  off.  Don't blame 
[02:16:30]  me for my  son Stan.  He saw the  darn cartoon and  now he's off to  join the clan.  And my boy Eric  once had my  picture on his  shelf.  But now when I  see him he tells  me to fuck  myself.  Well,  blame  Canada.  Blame  Canada.  It seems that  everything's gone  wrong since Canada  came along.  Blame  Canada.  Blame  Canada.  They're not even a  real country anyway.  My son could have  been a doctor or a  lawyer, Richard True.  He said he burned a  plaque of piggy on a 
[02:17:00]  barbecue.  Should we blame the  matches?  Should we blame the  fire?  Or the doctors who  allowed him to expire?  Heck no!  Blame  Canada.  Blame  Canada.  With all the  hockey hummer  below.  And that bitch  Aunt Marie too.  Blame  Canada.  She's not  Canada.  The smoke we  must stop.  The trash we  have cashed.  The laughter  and fuck.  The sobbing  is up.  We must  play them  and cause  a fuss before  somebody thinks  to play  me.  No! 
[02:17:30]  Sore!  Are you  breathing?  Sore!  Are you  breathing?  Hey, let's go 
[02:18:00]  right to the phones  first.  Say hi to  Callie.  Callie, what's  up?  Hello, it's me  again, I got  PDAs on the  line.  Is brother  Joe talking?  Yes, he is.  Alright, cool.  Of course he  is.  Yap, yap,  yap.  I know  they covered  that.  You want  to do  that?  You want  to do  something?  Okay, is  that one  you hate  to do?  Technically,  Hendrix.  Okay, fine.  How about  it?  One, yeah,  one is good.  Yeah, two,  one.  All right.  To you!  I'm  going to  start it like  this now.  Perfect. 
[02:18:30]  I hurt  myself  today.  This signal  is traveling,  isn't it?  It's going  from radio. 
[02:19:00]  to a  receiver,  to a  phone,  to us,  to a  satellite,  back down  to you  out there.  Hey,  can't lose  much quality.  What is  this?  His brother. 
[02:19:30]  YouTube  tribute  band.  Oh.  What love  what night  with one  need  in the  night  what love  we get to  share it  leaves you  baby  don't care  for it.  did I 
[02:20:00]  disappoint you  You've been for bad days in your mouth  You act like you never had love  You want me to go without  Well, it's too late tonight  To drive the fire down into the light 
[02:20:30]  We're one, one of the things  We get to carry each other, carry each other  The whistling Joe.  Yeah.  That's Joe on guitar.  A little taste of 2U.  Does that sound like them, that song?  Oh, that's 2U?  Yeah.  And they do, they're at B.B. King's not too long ago or something like that? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  They do New Year's or something like that?  They were there when U2 was playing Madison Square Garden.  Oh, that's right.  It's ridiculous how these cover bands, these tribute bands, have taken off.  Like, my brother's in this one, and he just got back from Mexico twice.  Yeah.  He's going to, like, fucking Japan, South America.  For some reason, they really think it's U2 down there in these weird countries.  In Japan, yeah.  Yeah.  And they're willing to pay through the nose.  It's like, he started his music career wanting, like everybody else, to have a band with original 
[02:21:30]  music, tour, be a rock star.  Right.  And then he's made more money.  It's been more lucrative for him to be a goddamn U2 cover band.  But he travels around and makes money.  He has a good time.  Fuck it.  How does he do with the ladies in that whole situation?  I think when he's not going out with one, he does just fine.  Oh, okay.  But if he goes out with one, then I guess he's loyal as any guy. 
[02:22:00]  He's a faithful guy.  I get it.  I get it.  Well, yeah, because he's the guitar player, so he's got to be the edge persona.  And then the singer is the Bono guy.  And he, the chicks fucking dig him.  He looks just like Bono.  It's creepy.  Who's that?  Not your brother.  No, yeah, the singer.  The singer looks just like Bono.  It's really creepy.  Really?  Yeah.  It's really good.  I just actually just sat down with him last week.  We were at the Grammys and stuff, and I had to give him the, because we're doing the 
[02:22:30]  TRL awards.  Yeah.  And we gave him the most inspired artist awards.  So, literally, the most crazy moment in my entire, never mind career, but just life.  He walks in, and he sits down, and I go, hi.  I was really nervous, you know, the whole time.  I'm thinking, you know, days.  I'm thinking, you know, before this.  I'm like, what am I going to say to him?  How am I going to make this a perfect moment?  How do I hang out with this guy?  What do I say to hang out with this guy?  You know?  So, he comes over.  I'm like, hey, I'm Damien.  He goes, I know that.  And he comes over, and he sits down, and we just start talking about, you know, AIDS and stuff  like that.  Oh, Jesus.  All the causes. 
[02:23:00]  That's got to be so hard.  It was wild, though.  I was like, this is by far the coolest moment in my life.  How does that make you feel?  Well, did you tell him that you like, like, you listen to Anthony and stuff?  It's Joe, right?  You sound like, yeah.  Joe?  His brother, Joe.  Yeah.  That's got to, you know.  I'm on the bottom, man.  That's one of those things where I'm really bad at.  There are certain people I could not imagine sitting down and talking to.  We just had G. Gordon Liddy in.  Right.  You know, that guy can sit there.  I could talk to him for hours about things because I'm really interested in that kind  of thing, and he's talkative and stuff. 
[02:23:30]  Someone like Bono or, like, Bono would freak me out.  I wouldn't even know how to do that.  You don't feel worthy.  You know, this is like someone who, like, I mean, I'm a guy who, I'll go to Starbucks  and spend $70 on coffee a week.  This guy takes his money and goes to Africa and helps people and stuff like that.  Yeah, like, that's just it.  He's a totally selfless person, and I'm, like, completely selfish and, not completely,  but.  I'd want to tell a joke or something and be like, you're wasting time that could be spent  saving people.  Wait, wait.  I'd just tell a joke or something.  I'm just trying to get along with you all that here.  It's kind of fun. 
[02:24:00]  And he's pretty well known.  I mean.  A little bit.  A little bit, Jimmy.  He might be the biggest rock star in the world.  Worldwide.  Him or Jagger, maybe.  I mean, the guy's huge.  Yeah.  Can you toss that between those two and Eddie Vedder?  But he's one of those.  One day we had Perry Farrell, however you want to pronounce his last name, had him on  our show up in Boston.  He sat down.  I swear to you, I could have had a better conversation with that big alien that came out of the Close  Encounters ship than him.  I had not a clue what he was talking about. 
[02:24:30]  I couldn't relate to anything he was saying.  Remember when he was explaining his latest music festival?  I don't even know.  Was it still Lollapalooza?  No.  It was something after Lollapalooza.  I forgot the name of the damn thing.  And he sat down and explained to us.  And he's like, it's going to be an all-nighter.  And we're going to try to make contact with the aliens.  Dude, there were aliens involved.  There were aliens involved.  And he's talking.  I'm like, I have nothing to say to this gentleman.  Not a word.  We're just going to start bonfires after the bands get off the stage and try to communicate 
[02:25:00]  with the aliens.  Wait, was that in New York?  Because him and the whole band came in.  Well, that's when he went back to Jane's Addiction.  Then we got the whole band in.  This was in Boston.  Yeah.  He was just...  Some people, though.  Some people are out there.  Yeah.  How do you...  Because you've got to sit and interview them.  The funny thing is, too, with TRL and stuff, it's live.  Right.  So people will come...  We had those T-A-T-U girls, those Russian schoolgirls who put out that song for a long  time.  You remember those girls at all?  They dressed up like Russian schoolgirls.  Oh, yeah.  The lesbians.  The lesbians.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  The whole act was like they were lesbians.  Look at Jim's face.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  His eyes just got really big.  I saw them.  Yeah.  What the fuck were their names?  They had just the really tight white T-shirts on.  Yeah.  No bras.  And they came on and they were totally drugged out or something like that.  And you have to sit there and you have to pretend that...  Tattoo?  Somehow you're live on air.  You have to conduct an interview normally.  Do you pre-interview them or no?  Most times.  Yeah.  But it's right before they get there.  It's not like we call them four days in advance.  So they show up and the producer's like, all right, these girls are like cracked out  of their skull. 
[02:26:00]  You know, good luck out there.  Good luck.  God speak.  Yeah.  Anyone else where you're just standing there going, oh, my God, I can't believe I'm talking  to this person.  Heath Ledger was a rough one for me.  Literally like just sitting there and, you know, hey, tell us about the movie.  It's a movie about a horse and the horse is just seeking life.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, come on, dude.  Give me something.  What movie was that?  Christ, you're in a room full of neon lights and screaming kids.  You know, jump up and down.  Was it for the Brokeback or?  No, this is a while ago. 
[02:26:30]  This is a long time ago, but it was some sort of a horse or something that he rode.  It kind of could be about Brokeback.  It could have been.  It wasn't a horse.  He was riding in that seat in the tent.  I'll tell you that one.  I'll bet he wishes it was.  Oh, so he was kind of like dull.  Very boring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very boring.  So he got that too.  Anyone you wanted to punch in the face?  Just where you're like, man, I just want to smack you.  Sometimes people are like, sometimes you'll get like an actress on or something and she's 
[02:27:00]  just so, it doesn't bring anything to the table.  Yeah.  You know?  And it's like, well, then why are you here?  You know?  God, we go through that same thing.  With E-Rock.  Doesn't bring anything to the table.  We go through that same thing here.  And the bigger the star, usually the interview just stinks.  Yeah.  It's like pulling teeth, you know?  And then you got their publicist.  Yeah.  Oh, make sure you don't ask him this or that or whatever.  And then you go, you know, fuck you.  I'm going to ask anyway.  And then all of a sudden they're dragging their people out.  And they start making it.  Like it's going to be the end of the world if we ask a crazy question.  Especially at this show. 
[02:27:30]  Like at a TRL and stuff, they can say, listen, don't go near this or this or that.  Whatever.  At this show, it's like everything is fair game.  You know?  Yeah.  Well, that's the point of this show anyway.  You can't go into this.  I mean.  It's hard to keep us reined in with what we can or can't ask people.  Have you interviewed 50 Cent?  What's that?  50 Cent, you interviewed him?  Nice guy.  We flew together.  Actually down to Cancun.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We spoke for three minutes and then he hated me for four hours.  You make it sound like you booked the flights together and everything.  I said, Curtis, do you want to go first?  He said, Jim, do I ever go anything but first? 
[02:28:00]  We laughed.  We had a condition.  Yeah, he was actually very soft spoken.  I was surprised.  That's funny.  What kind of reception you get replacing?  You know, because everyone thinks of Carson when they think of TRL.  How is that stepping in?  It was tough in the beginning.  Yeah.  I used to watch, you know, I was at Northeastern in Boston working at a Top 40 station in Boston  and I was like, I'd watch the show every now and again.  I'd watch Carson.  I'd go, what is the deal?  You know, this is, I don't understand what the big deal is with this guy.  He makes it look so easy and like he's just up there and it's very relaxed and whatnot. 
[02:28:30]  But that's, I met the guy and he's a really nice guy.  And then I started doing the show and about two weeks into the show, I was like, I realized  I was terrible, you know?  And like the thing with MTV is like doing that show is it's live.  There's no editing.  You can't go back.  So for automatically you suck for like eight months and it's in front of millions of people  watching.  So it's terrible.  And they let you last eight months.  And they let you last eight months.  And it was just like you got something because, you know, most people are like, look, get rid of 
[02:29:00]  them immediately.  What kind of audition process was there?  You couldn't have just stepped in and said, hi, I'm your guy.  It was wild because there was a lady who, I worked at Kiss in Boston and there was this  lady.  Was that the job you had just before MTV?  Yeah.  That's a big step up.  Yeah.  Now I used to listen to you guys actually, like when they were, you know, in big dig  traffic and stuff, going to school and stuff like that.  So I guess it's wild.  So, yeah, no, there was some lady who worked at Kiss 108 a while ago.  She went to MTV, met one of the casting director in the cafeteria, MTV cafeteria. 
[02:29:30]  And the casting director said, hey, listen, I'm kind of casting for VJs.  If you have any leads.  And she said, well, there's this kid in Boston.  He's at Kiss 108.  She goes, I'm going to Boston next week.  Actually, I'm going to Emerson College and all that stuff.  And she said, go to Kiss 108 and check out this kid.  He might be, he might be pretty good.  He's kind of got that look.  So they came to the station.  I auditioned in the basement.  I think like during one of my history classes, I had to write out like two video intros.  So I wrote out like two video intros during one of my history classes, left the history  class a little early, auditioned.  And then for some reason, right after the audition, I kind of knew. 
[02:30:00]  I don't know what it was.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  What's a video intro?  Right out of school?  I would have no idea how to intro a video.  They basically were like, listen, pick a couple, pick a hip hop act and pick a rock act to  show diversity and just talk about it and like intro the video and say some facts about  it that you might know.  So I guess it's perfect.  Talking up a video.  I actually went on one of those auditions for VH1.  Remember that time?  See, here's the deal, by the way.  It's anybody, anybody that's in radio that doesn't look like they're from the island 
[02:30:30]  of Dr. Moreau gets, are like, it's a commodity.  Right.  People want them because they got a good voice.  Yeah.  And they have a look.  They have a good look.  Same thing, you know, Ryan Seacrest gets a great gig out of radio like that.  But other people do Reagan impressions and sit behind a fucking microphone.  I was on, I was on stage and it tells dirty jokes on a fucking stage in front of HBO.  I was intro on Stephen Lynch and Caroline's and I guess there was some kind of talent person 
[02:31:00]  in the audience.  Next thing I know, I got a call and I'm at VH1 in front of a camera, like just trying  to act like a VJ.  It was so awkward.  What were you doing?  What'd you have to do?  They would just throw like CDs at you and say, yeah, talk about, you know, back then  VH1 was really faggy.  So it's like, talk about Celine Dion.  Yeah, talk about Cher, talk about this.  It's like, I obviously bombed.  God, I would love to see that tape.  You know what?  If I could find that video, it would be great.  It would be great fun.  And I get asked to do a voiceover for a fucking Discovery Channel commercials. 
[02:31:30]  Did you really?  That's all I get.  Yeah, for the station here.  That's all I get.  Here's a intro video.  This is not an intro video.  That's all I get.  You know that 50 Cent song?  It's your birthday?  Now you can watch it.  You're hired.  Amazing.  Amazing.  You stink.  By the way, we have another celebrity in the studio today.  Our own Joey Paisano.  Hi, sweetie.  Yes.  What's up, guys?  Of Paisanos of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:32:00]  We know Joey.  We've known him for about, wow, 10 years?  No.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years?  We're up to?  Seven or eight years now, yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Has he ever asked you for a favor?  No comment.  Hasn't asked me, but I'm waiting for it.  It's coming.  I'm like G. Gordon Liddy's son.  I can't talk.  Can't talk about that right now?  I can't talk.  No.  He owns a restaurant in Little Italy, so.  Very nice.  But he's also in a movie.  What movie?  Yes.  It's a movie called The Bunker. 
[02:32:30]  Cool.  It's a snuff film.  He's in a documentary.  It's called The Veloci Pits.  Yeah, it's called The Bunker.  Yeah, it's called The Bunker.  When did you get the acting bug?  You know, one day I was just slinging the pasta, and I thought, I want to make money like you  guys.  I want to be an actor.  Let me try and do something different.  Wait, you went through proper channels for this?  No.  Or someone just, no, proper channels, stop it.  No, no, no.  I just make a phone call, and all of a sudden I'm in a movie. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Did you send a big bouquet of flowers for saying thank you?  I never knew it would be so easy, but Joey Paisano will not get that picture.  Well, when you look like you, it is easy.  We've learned that.  We've learned that.  Yeah.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  But supposedly the director is blind or something?  Yes, yeah.  It's a good friend of mine.  His name is Joe Monks.  He's blind, yes. 
[02:33:30]  And he's going to be the first blind director ever.  Wow.  What did he see that he wasn't supposed to see?  The whole shot is just fucking the upper left-hand corner of the ceiling.  God, it's perfect.  Wow.  Jimmy.  What?  The guy can't see.  How does he know?  All I would do is fuck with it.  I would just film my cop and go, what a scene.  You got to use it.  He's trying to enter it in Sundance.  Yeah, he's going to have a lot of trust there, Joey. 
[02:34:00]  A lot of trust.  Yes, a lot of trust.  Well, yeah, he's got a director of photography, I would take it.  Yes, very good DPs helping him out and stuff.  But, I mean, it was his vision.  He, you know, told us.  Well, it was, yes.  Has he been blind his whole life?  No, he wasn't recently, about two years ago.  Oh, okay.  All right, so he's got a head start.  He's got a little easier.  He's got a head start, yeah.  He knew what he wanted it to look like.  He had started this, I think, before he actually went blind.  Did he know he was going blind or was it kind of sudden? 
[02:34:30]  I think he kind of knew, yeah.  Okay.  Oof.  And what do you play?  I'll give you one guess.  Somebody that might be involved in some kind of organized-type crime.  Informant.  How did you figure that out?  Right off the bat.  It's not cold in here anymore.  No, it really isn't, man.  Oof.  Well, that's good.  Yes, yes.  I definitely want to see this.  And you were acting, right?  I was acting.  It was pretty scary. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, you know, a friend calls me up.  He's like, yeah, you know, I'm going to be shooting up in New York some scenes.  You know, do you want to be in my movie?  And you, coincidentally enough, were shooting up in New York also.  Where is it?  You make a left at that hole we dug.  All the scenes took one take.  They're all scratching their head like, I thought you told us you'd never done this before.  He's perfect.  Right.  He's perfect for the role.  Are you a good actor?  No.  No. 
[02:35:30]  Well, I haven't actually really seen any of it yet, but I can't imagine.  Do you get to speak in the movie?  What kind of lines?  Yeah, I had like...  Yeah, how many lines?  Yeah, what kind of dialogue?  Give us a line.  Give us a line from the movie.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Don't even act.  Just say one of the lines.  You don't have to act it out.  You can just say what one of the lines is.  Because I can look at them here.  I just can't get any sound.  Yeah, the trailer's up?  Yeah, the trailer's up on sightunseenpictures.com.  And you can get one of my lines from it. 
[02:36:00]  You look...  I'm looking at you.  Do I have the look?  You look exactly like you look right here.  They didn't do any makeup on your shirt.  No, no, no.  The same banana republic shirt.  The same shirt on.  You know what?  Just show up.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going to get makeup or wardrobe for this.  Just show up.  Just show up, Joey.  Yeah.  Wow, the movie's called The Bunker?  Yeah, it's going to be a big premiere in June in L.A.  And I want you guys to come out.  Ooh.  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  I've never been to an L.A. premiere. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it's fine.  Who else is in this movie?  You bastard, Jimmy.  Don't rub it in.  There's a bunch of actors.  This is an independent film.  Right.  Nobody crazy or anything like that.  You ever do any acting?  I was in...  That's how these guys met.  I met Jim when we were in acting class together.  I had no idea Damien was even on MTV.  He was like...  You have no idea...  You know which money is popular culture.  I met him in spring break about two years ago.  And it was in the blazing hot sun.  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember?  And it was right by that jacuzzi. 
[02:37:00]  And the...  Do you remember?  You don't remember that?  Was that the day I was shooting?  It was very brief.  I wonder if that was the day I was shooting.  Because if it was, it was like I had bad diarrhea.  It was the only time I got diarrhea.  I was filming a pilot.  My...  It was...  My asshole had like a conga line going through it.  I had to shoot.  It was 9.30 in the morning.  It was about 110 degrees on the beach with the lights.  And I was running in and out of the bathroom.  And I think you were going on to...  To do that.  It was a film and a live TRL.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he said was down there.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay, so I do remember.  I just didn't...  So that's where we officially...  I didn't make the connection in acting class.  He was just a nice guy and he could act. 
[02:37:30]  And, you know, we did some acting.  Yeah.  And then I found out...  Jim was one of the best...  I know he downplays it, but he was one of the best actors in the class.  And he kind of acts like this.  Yeah, I always turn my head and raise my voice when I get nervous when I act.  Remember...  There was that...  What do you mean?  It was funny because after every scene, our acting teacher was like, improvise.  You know, make up a line and stuff at the end of the scene.  And everyone's line would be like either, you know, a laugh or an expression and stuff.  And Jim's would always be, you know, Sharon, you bitch or something.  It would always be like a swear.  Remember?  Of course it would.  Karen, you whore. 
[02:38:00]  And he'd walk out and slam the door.  Yeah, you know, it's soap opera stuff.  I don't want to be a soap star.  But you were really good.  You ever...  You been in anything?  No.  No?  No.  This must tie up a lot of your time.  You know what's funny is I was actually...  MTV called me a couple weeks ago.  And they said, hey, you know that CBS show, Love Monkey?  And I'm like, yeah, it's that sitcom.  They go, how would you like to be on it?  You play yourself and you intro like it's the season finale.  And you intro this guy who comes on TRL and stuff and blah, blah, blah.  I go, that's great. 
[02:38:30]  You know, I'm thinking, hey, here's my...  At least somewhat of a toe into the pool of acting.  Come to find out the show was canceled like two days ago.  So it's never going to even...  No.  Oh, he was supposed to be like a singer or something?  A singer-songwriter I had to introduce, so...  What's the average age of the girls that show up to a TRL?  You have to be 16 or over.  Oh, you do have to be 16 or over.  So it's like...  Still dangerous, but...  Oh, it's still pretty tough.  Basically, Anthony is asking for two tickets.  If he could hook him up, he'd be very happy. 
[02:39:00]  I'm just saying, I've seen the show.  I want to give a big shout-out to my parole officer, Officer McMullen.  He wants a ticket, and he wants to know, could you talk to someone to sneak his girlfriend in?  All right.  I've just...  I've seen the show, and I know that sometimes there are some young girls there.  There are.  There are.  That's all I'm saying.  Do you ever look at any and just go, all right, this one.  Like, she's obviously 18, 19.  Like, this one I got to talk to.  It's only happened, honestly, and with other VJs, it's happened more.  But I've really, when I'm working, I've really liked to... 
[02:39:30]  For some reason, it's live, you're in the zone, whatever.  It's happened twice.  Yeah?  Twice, yeah.  Wow.  Have you gotten a rap?  It's...  You know...  Close the deal.  Of course.  He's so humble.  What that means is there's a little...  When you go backstage there, there's a little place where all the celebrities will take  their own pictures, like a little goofy three or four photo, you know, of yourself  and the people they have on the wall is sickening.  You know, everyone from Ozzy to me.  Ah!  And I'm not on the wall, but I took their pictures. 
[02:40:00]  But that would be a great place to bring a girl.  It's better than a bathroom, which is your choice.  It's not my dating pool.  You know, I don't want to date people in my audience, you know.  I just, you know, it'd be, you know, nothing against anyone.  Not ethical?  It's not ethical, yeah.  I mean, I'm sure Regis Filden doesn't pick up the broads from Ohio who are, you know,  Hey, some of those house frows are pretty hot.  See, I date only in my audience.  They're the only ones who will hate me.  All right, all right, you're funny.  Go ahead, put it in, quickly. 
[02:40:30]  They tolerate my fucking, my fat bullfrog neck.  Let's go to Ryan in Pennsylvania.  Ryan!  Ryan!  Hello.  Psst.  No, huh?  No?  Psst.  Ryan, Pennsylvania?  Psst.  I just want to say that Joey's food is excellent.  Thank you.  I was trying to help out Joey here, and Ryan is a dummy.  Hope right now he's trying to talk, but his car is upside down in a ditch,  and that sound is his wheels spinning.  Oh, shit.  Grinding to a halt.  All right, let's go to Chris in Japan.  Chris. 
[02:41:00]  Is this real?  No.  Chris.  Chris!  I think he fell asleep.  He's been on hold for 45 minutes.  You want to say that he's stationed in Japan and he's spreading the virus.  Doing a great job for us there, Chris.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's real.  That's great.  We get one of these every once in a while.  Yeah, every so often somebody's been on hold for a while and they fall asleep on the phone.  And they fall asleep.  Well, what time is it in Japan? 
[02:41:30]  It's about 45 minutes earlier.  Shut up.  No idea.  It's a little more than that, Jim.  Couple more minutes.  He's literally, that is literally him snoring.  Yeah.  Yeah, I believe it now.  Fell asleep.  How great would it be if we heard an apnea death?  Ooh.  You hear him struggling for breath and going to wake him.  Anytime I hear one of these, I think back to a problem I had many years ago.  I was going out with a girl and she was pissed off at me.  We were having an argument on the phone.  Pretty new relationship. 
[02:42:00]  I think it was like our first argument ever.  So we were still kind of, you know, in love, but we were having a little problem.  And she's going on and on about something.  And the next thing I remember is waking up.  I'm laying on my bed with the phone there, just going, making that phone off the hook noise.  And I'm like, I am in such huge fucking trouble, man.  Because not only was she pissed at me, but I just fell asleep during her conversation.  Fell asleep.  Called her back.  And it was just never, never the same. 
[02:42:30]  But what was she bitching about?  She was bitching about the fact that.  You don't pay attention or listen?  It was something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, that I wasn't listening or paying attention.  You're not giving enough.  Then I fell asleep.  Not giving enough to the relationship.  You're not giving enough to the relationship.  You don't care enough.  And then out.  Out.  But waking up and like figuring out where I was and why I was there and what the phone  was doing.  Then it all clicked.  And I'm like, I was talking to.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Oh, original argument out the window. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  How the fuck could you fall asleep on me?  Welcome to the new argument.  The new argument.  Argument mocked, too.  Well, I say we keep Chris on the line.  I don't think the phone charges are that bad.  See how long he hangs in there.  We have Joey's line from the movie.  From Japan.  Oh, nice.  Yes, we do.  From the bunker, right?  Or bunker.  Only one line?  Oh, we have a couple.  I don't know.  Let's see what this is about.  Let's.  Congressman, we find people.  That's what we do. 
[02:43:30]  Even people who don't want to be found.  Especially people who don't want to be found.  Oh, sorry.  That's audio from Joey's restaurant.  I played the wrong one.  Is that back in the rear entrance?  Wow.  In the kitchen?  That's a big mistake there.  Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy.  I was supposed to hit CD2.  I'm sorry, Joey.  No problem, boys.  No problem.  That was very good acting. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Acting.  Wink, wink.  I'm glad Poe didn't frisk me today.  No, huh?  Joey gets very insulted when Master Poe.  As well he should be.  Joey's on the up and up.  Joey goes back a long time with us.  Joe Monks might be on the phone right now.  Joe Monks.  Joe.  Hey, there.  Hey.  I'm on the A with you guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Is this him?  This is him.  This is him.  All right.  It's hard to hear you.  You're probably talking into the ear part.  Stop.  Jimmy. 
[02:44:30]  Jimmy is a son of a bitch.  You know, you get used to that after a while, though.  I'll tell you.  Where's your line, Jimmy?  There's a bunch of Joey's balls up there.  He can't remember his lines.  It's only been two weeks.  How many lines did he give Joey?  He had about six lines.  In fact, he's got one of the more important scenes in the flick.  He's, you know, I picked, you know, crooked Italian to play a crooked Italian.  Is he a bag man?  He's a bag man. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  He actually did a great job.  You know, he came in.  I know it's not what he usually does, but I wanted him because, you know, he had the look,  which I haven't seen it.  He certainly does.  He certainly does.  Was his acting what you thought it would be?  Yes, actually.  We did a number of run-throughs, and he was working with, you know, a couple of vets.  You know, they've done some TV.  They've done some low-budget indies.  And we ran through his lines probably about eight, nine times before we started doing takes. 
[02:45:30]  And then in his close-up, which these guys will probably see in the trailer.  It's a scary close-up, Joey.  I've known you for a long time.  I never want to see that face.  That's scary.  That's all I'll tell you.  That is really scary.  I'm happy to say I've never seen that face.  Wow.  Well, you want to know something about him?  He shows up and stuff like that.  The money that we throw on a table and stuff, it's, you know, your typical crappy wads of  hundreds, and Joe's pulling out full bills and stuff.  He's like, oh, you need more hundreds?  He's got the front.  He's got to bring the prop money. 
[02:46:00]  Joey brought the prop money.  I should have told him to bring a briefcase.  I mean, you could have let him go light, you know?  God damn it.  I wish we had a shovel and lime.  I got it in the trunk.  Maybe the next movie.  I'll use them again.  Yeah, you should give Joey some gigs, man.  Well, right on, Joe.  When's the movie start?  We're going to be premiering in L.A. in June.  I heard Joe invite these guys out.  We'll be sending invites out to you guys, definitely.  It's going to be June 6th. 
[02:46:30]  It's that Sunday.  We're going out there for the Fangoria Weekend of Horrors.  So we're going to have, you know, we're expecting guys from Lionsgate and New York and New Line and a bunch of guys coming out for it.  But, you know, hopefully you'll all be there.  I know Joey's coming.  He wants to rent Belushi's suite.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, Joey was telling us that.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, no, so June 6th will be out.  It's a little creepy.  We'll also be out, you know, we're going to have four-wall down in New York probably, you know, August or September.  So hopefully, you know, I'll be coming up there and stuff.  We'll get these guys out for the after party. 
[02:47:00]  Do you like how the film came out?  Yeah, yeah.  We're very pleased.  We had three...  But how do you, I mean, a serious question here, how do you judge it if you're blind?  Like...  I mean, when, like Joe said, you know, I've got people that I trust.  In fact, I come out of a background in comic books, and I've been doing comic books even since I've lost my sight.  I still actually lay out my own storyboards and stuff like that for the books with templates and stick figures the way I used to.  But I would actually go onto the set and say, listen, I want you to sit here or stand here, and I want you to, you know, this is how your blocking would go. 
[02:47:30]  And I would give them a film reference.  I've got a huge repository of, you know, film reference in my head from when I lost my sight four years ago.  So I would say, hey, you know, there's three people in a scene, the three shot.  I want you to be, like, aligned like the three shot in Jaws, you know, the Indianapolis scene.  I want you two guys sitting here, you standing in the foreground, and this is the depth of field I want.  And then you let the people around you do their job.  I imagine you're going to get a lot of attention.  We have been. 
[02:48:00]  Fangoria's been writing us up a lot.  Horrorchannel.com's been writing us up.  I've been interviewed for a couple of magazines already.  Since it's a first, you know, right now it's a curiosity.  I'm a curiosity.  And nobody probably gives a shit what the film is like because that's the story.  It's the blind guy behind it.  But I think that's going to end when the movie comes out and people will see it's not just, you know, some piece of crap.  You know, that's the goal.  That's why we brought on the guys that we brought on to do it. 
[02:48:30]  Right on.  Cool.  Well, it was nice meeting you.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  It's Joe Monks, everyone.  You came in.  From the Bunker, director of Bunker.  All right.  Talk to you guys.  All right.  So long, Joe.  There's Joe.  Let's say hi to John the Trucker.  John, what's up?  It's 12.01 a.m. tomorrow morning in Japan.  Tomorrow in Japan?  Yeah.  Actually, it's like 12.08 a.m. 
[02:49:00]  What are the lotto numbers then?  We'll play them now.  Wait, what day is it?  Who wouldn't do this?  It's February 18th, about 12.05 a.m.  It's tomorrow.  It's tomorrow.  What am I doing here?  Let's go home.  It's Saturday.  We got a glimpse of tomorrow.  This is pretty cool.  What does the future look like?  You can wake him up.  All right.  So it's tomorrow in Japan.  That's right.  And Chris is still on the line sleeping, I think.  Chris?  Chris?  Chris? 
[02:49:30]  Sounds like the phone may have fallen.  You can hear it faintly now.  Next to his shoulder.  You can hear the heavy breathing.  That is an expensive call, man.  That is an expensive call.  Can I leave him on all the way through Ron and Fez?  Oh, you can just leave it on.  Yeah, maybe Ron and Fez will get it.  He'll wake up.  Yeah, we need an outcome.  We need an outcome to Chris in Japan.  He fell asleep waiting to talk to us today.  Although, don't all the phones cut off at 11?  11.  Do they? 
[02:50:00]  No?  No, they don't.  Travis?  Oh, that's good news.  Travis actually said no.  So if they do, that's a big chance you took there.  Let's say hi to John in California.  John?  Boys, how are you this morning?  Good.  I'd just like to tell Mr. Fezano I visited New York for my first time, oh, November last,  end of last year.  And the only thing I knew when I was trying to be cool and be like a real New Yorker and  I wanted to go get a good meal and the only thing I could think was, well, ONA always  say, Fezano's on Mulberry, and that's where I went.  Best Italian dinner I've ever had in my life, bro. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  In the heart of Little Italy.  Had a great time.  Had a great bottle of wine.  You know, I'll be honest, everything about the restaurant's great, man.  That's great.  I like the summer, though.  I like going to your restaurant in the summer, though, where you can sit outside, table outside,  do a little people watching.  That's great.  End up in the gutter with a cigar hanging out of your mouth and your eyeball gone.  All right, Joe, you don't have to laugh that hard.  I remember that. 
[02:51:00]  You're scaring our guest.  We're used to him, and Damien's not.  Are you finding a lot of people coming from all over the country now?  Because it's a different audience.  Like, back in the day, we were, you know, huge in New York, so it was all New Yorkers,  but now it seems like when people come to New York, they're stopping by?  People are calling and emailing from all over the country.  I mean, I get emails from everywhere now, and driving up, just tons of people from Philly,  Boston, you know, are coming in and heard the show. 
[02:51:30]  But, yeah, it's weird when you get, like, people from Kentucky are, you know, sending  me emails saying, hey, when I get up to New York, you know, I've got to stop by, and  it's that.  Yeah, it's cool.  New audience.  New customers.  Very cool.  All right.  We're stalling, because Fred Willard's supposed to call today.  He's got a new movie out.  Oh, he's great.  Yeah.  He's great.  Really funny, man.  He's calling in a few, running 15 minutes late.  Well, the new movie's out, Date Movie?  Yeah.  That's what Judah Freeland was in that, too.  Is that the one with Eddie Griffin?  Yeah, Judah's in the trailer.  Who was in here? 
[02:52:00]  Well, um, yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, the movie's going to be, uh, don't ruin any interviews yet.  They didn't screen it for critics.  It's one of those movies.  Like, we need a Fred Willard bio.  Like, I went through.  That's great.  I went through the papers today, and there's no review to be had.  That's never a good sign for a movie.  But a lot of times, a good comedy will get shit out.  You know what I mean?  It's like, uh, a lot of times, the papers will trash a good comedy.  It'll probably number one at the box office.  If it's too childish.  It'll probably reach number one, box office. 
[02:52:30]  Every new movie does.  Fred Willard was, uh, the funniest, uh, character waiting for Guffman.  Yeah.  In that movie, where he's the actor, fucking hysterical.  And his wife.  Midnight at the Oasis.  It was great.  Yeah.  He plays the perfect tool.  And then spinal tap.  This might be him now.  Oh, it is.  It is.  Are we going to keep, uh, Chris?  Yes, yes.  From Japan on the line? 
[02:53:00]  Mr. Willard.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Well, it's a pleasure to be here.  Hi.  We also have Joey Paisano in studio, Jimmy Norton, and Damian Fahey from MTV.  Wonderful.  So you might hear a lot of different voices today.  Jimmy Norton is the comic?  Yeah, man.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Wow.  Hey.  Hold the phone.  Fred, how do you know about our own Jimmy Norton?  Is he the stand-up comic? 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, I love him.  I saw him at the Comedy Cellar in New York, and he may know my good friend T. Sean Shannon.  Oh, yeah.  I know T. Sean well.  I hate this.  He likes to be there live, and if he likes a person, he says, he's a good man, and he  always says that about you.  Yeah, he's a good man.  I really hate this, because I'm a big Fred Willard fan.  I love what you do, and the fact that you know Jimmy.  Jimmy will not leave this alone now.  Wait, let me ask.  Fred Willard, do you know Anthony from the Opie and Anthony program? 
[02:54:00]  I don't, I'm not, I'm not registering.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I know, I know the name.  A crushing blow.  Yeah, he knows the name Anthony exists.  That's great.  Well, that's all right.  I've heard of you.  You're a legend.  Yeah.  You're a legend.  Yeah, my, my legend.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm all depressed.  Thank you.  And Anthony's a huge fan of yours, Fred. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, love, love your, love your work, sir.  Well, thanks so much.  I thought Waiting for Guffman, any, any of those movies where you and your little clicky  friends get together.  Yeah.  Where no one else is included.  And you all get together.  And it's hysterically funny.  Best in show.  There's nobody on the set.  We don't even talk to the people, you know, who set the props or something.  No, you're all one little click.  We were.  You know, if someone says, can we bring you lunch?  You say, well, what do you think?  I mean, it's just people like that. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, because they're all on the outside.  And all of you, even in between scenes and everything, are all laughing with each other.  Oh, even though, if there's no joke, we sit and laugh.  Just to make everyone else feel left out.  Absolutely.  Fred, I want to be part of your little group.  How do I get involved?  Oh, it's impossible.  Well, let's see.  Why don't you fill.  Did you get the application?  Why, you got to fill out an application with references?  Go to your gasoline station and ask. 
[02:55:30]  There's a big drive on this month to get new actors.  Fill out the application.  Send it in to Chris Guest.  His home address is right there.  Yeah.  Tell him your credentials.  Yeah, Chris Guest, man.  He comes up with some great stuff.  Yes, he does.  God bless him.  I never, never a day goes by that I don't say bless Christopher Guest.  Yeah.  And Gene Levy, he's very instrumental in that, too.  Yeah.  Well, now you got a date movie? 
[02:56:00]  That's what it is, yeah.  That's what you're doing.  It's a lot broader comedy than the Chris Guest movies.  It's really an out-and-out whoops, you know.  Oh, my God, are they doing that?  But it's PG-13.  It doesn't go too far.  It's just naughty.  It's naughty in part.  Any skin?  Are we going to see any skin?  You see, oh, dear.  I only looked at, you know, I only saw it once when I was only watching myself at the time.  That's what I mean.  You see some of my skin, yeah. 
[02:56:30]  I'm going to see nude Fred Willard.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I can get you those over the internet.  All right.  But be careful.  Sometimes there's plainclothes policemen on the other end.  I'm here to see Fred Willard.  I'm here to pick him up.  We met on the internet, and the cops swoop in and say, no, you were talking to an officer.  And I hate it when they do that, but, you know, you've got to protect yourself.  Anyway, it's the kind of, you know, it's good for kind of a first or second date, because it's naughty. 
[02:57:00]  It can be, you know, a little titillating, but it's not a gross, really a gross-out movie where you might be embarrassed if you don't know your date well.  Not like a Travis Bickle first date, where you're taken to that movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that kind of thing.  Hey, Fred, I was looking at your bio.  You were in amazing, the Bob Newhart show, and what did you do on Laverne and Shirley, man?  What a career.  That was one of the best roles I ever had.  I played a guy who came to town with another guy, and we were dating Laverne and Shirley, and it turned out we were actually robbers. 
[02:57:30]  We wanted to blow a hole in the wall and rob the bank next door.  And there was a sight gag, you know, Lenny and Squiggy?  Yeah.  I said to my friend at one time, I said, it's time to go to the bathroom.  So we went into the bathroom, and we came out, and there was a huge explosion.  And David Landry, who played Squiggy, said, boy, they really had to go.  And I'll tell you, the whole week, they debated whether or not you could say that. 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  Well, it was the 50s.  Yeah, yeah.  But you were depicting the 50s, I understand.  That's right, that's right.  You couldn't say water closet, I hear, in one episode of Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, no.  And I was the one who said we couldn't say it.  That's shocking.  I remember watching Fernwood Tonight.  Do you?  Yeah, I'm actually old enough to recall Fernwood Tonight, the little spinoff from Mary Hartman. 
[02:58:30]  Exactly, yeah.  Another, you know.  And that whole click, very clicky back then.  Are there certain actors you just won't work with?  Wait a minute.  There were just two of us, Martin Mull and myself.  Well, it was a small click, but I don't remember anybody else coming in.  No, no.  We had plenty of guests.  Yeah, we had a lot of guests.  Yeah, but that was very cutting edge for back then, very risque.  Oh, yeah, yeah, it was.  In fact, it couldn't go on the air now, I don't think. 
[02:59:00]  There'd be so many protest groups calling in, you know.  Very insensitive racially to the handicapped, a lot of sexual innuendo going by.  The show was very funny.  Yeah, and both of us were dunderheads so we could get away with it, you know.  And we didn't come across as being mean-spirited.  We were just stupid.  Well, Martin kind of was mean-spirited. 
[02:59:30]  He was always very mean to you on that show, and you were always very accepting of it.  He was, you know, he'd give me the dirty looks for saying something, then he'd say something  dumber than I would say.  Yeah, I love that one.  But a date movie, okay.  Look for it.  When does it open?  Today.  Today?  I should have done your homework.  Tonight, as a matter of fact.  Tonight?  I should have done my homework.  This probably is showing right now, Anthony, as we speak.  If you guys could get over there and mention my name, get professional courtesy, and get in  and see it, and then tell your friends about it. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, can't I just go in and go, look, I was just talking to Fred Willard, and he said  I could just walk in.  It's on him.  Yeah.  And what always helps is if you get a little, you know, aggressive and say, listen, you  idiot.  That opens a lot of doors.  I'll give that a try.  You should be glad I'm very clicky, because they asked me who I wanted to talk to, and  I said, well, no one until you guys.  Yeah, right.  Thank you very much. 
[03:00:30]  It's good to be talking to someone who's clicky.  Yeah.  Will you come in studio if you're in New York?  Absolutely.  Okay, good.  I will be in New York in May and June this year, so I hope I get an invitation.  Oh, good.  I'd love to have you.  I'd love to have you in live, Fred.  Look for him.  Date movie.  Terrific.  Opening up tonight, or right now, if you want, go down there, mention Fred's name.  You get him for free.  Thank you.  Fred Willard.  Don't forget the key word.  Listen, you idiot.  Right. 
[03:01:00]  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  Nice talking to you.  Thanks, Fred.  There he goes.  Fred Willard, everyone.  He's got the life.  Yeah.  He's just himself.  People eat it up.  Yeah, the guy doesn't even have to put anything on.  He's like Vince Vaughn.  That's how he is.  Well, the thing is, guys like Fred and myself, I mean, what?  What?  What?  We're going to have to hear about that for a long time.  Dude, you don't understand.  You just get used to meeting people.  You talk.  Everybody likes him.  Everyone in the room is mentioned, and he's like, oh, Jim Norton, the comic? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, fuck.  Jimmy Norton, the now won't shut up about this comic.  Hey, Chris.  I met Fred years ago and asked, but he was very nice.  Yeah.  Shut up.  All right.  I want to see if Chris is still there.  Chris.  Chris in Japan.  Flatline.  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  He didn't hang up, though.  He's still there.  He's still there.  All right.  We'll keep him on hold.  You hanging?  I don't even hear anything Japanese in the background.  Nothing.  You might hear like some sort of a paper door opening. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Something.  Slippers or something.  Give me something Japanese.  Two small prostitutes robbing his wallet.  Little rotten feet in his back, all crunched up.  A happy ending.  Something.  Nails being done.  Are you hanging with us?  Yeah.  Cool.  Absolutely.  All right.  Cool.  More with Damien Fahey.  We'll talk about music next.  How's that?  That's cool.  Did you hear about this, like, gay music crap?  It was in the post yesterday.  What is it?  It's this week's gay music.  What is it actually gay? 
[03:02:30]  Or is it just, is it like, gay artists?  Celine Dion.  Basically, if you go to AOL, you can listen to music.  Everyone knows that now.  And there's genres.  Oh, there's a gay category.  There's a gay category.  What's this AOL you're talking about?  And you can listen to music there?  That's a little crazy.  It's the future.  A little something called the internet there, Fez.  Love that bit.  I want to steal it.  And they have the top ten gay songs of the week in the gay music category.  So we'll see what songs made the list, I guess.  Jimmy, do you know?  I certainly don't.  They're on your iPod? 
[03:03:00]  No.  Can you just play them live out of your iPod?  I have a few that belong there, though.  You have Karma Chameleon on there?  You have an ABBA song on your iPod?  No, ABBA.  I do have Karma Chameleon.  And I was listening to Africa by Toto in the cab ride over.  Jimmy, what do you got on your iPod?  I'm going to be honest.  This is terrible.  I was just in Puerto Rico, and I was lying on the beach.  And I had my iPod.  And I went to Richard Marks, and I put on Hazard.  Really?  Yeah.  Richard Marks on there?  Right into right here waiting.  I am willing to gamble and say that most people have more embarrassing shit on their iPod than 
[03:03:30]  they do music that people would deem cool.  I just think they do.  Because there's the music that you like that's cool, and then there's music that you're never  going to listen to, and it's kind of random music.  And then there's the really lame crap.  Yeah.  And I bet you're right.  I bet like 60% of the stuff is lame crap.  I think because it's so personal, and it's so yours, it's your iPod, you program it,  it's all private.  Yeah.  It's just you with your little earbuds in, listening.  You're making a good point. 
[03:04:00]  No friends are listening.  Right.  Or embarrassment.  So those guilty pleasures that people call them are fair game.  It's like being alone on the internet.  Yeah.  That's it.  No one's walking in.  I could jack it to whatever I want.  Absolutely.  And you know, I would-  Some video that might have turned up on Pal Talk last night.  Oh my God.  The oniony bag boys.  Two fucking homos.  The, um, no, 95% or 90% of my iPod is not awful stuff.  Maybe less than 10%.  Well, to who? 
[03:04:30]  To anybody?  No, but it's very consistent.  Like what?  What kind of stuff?  Yeah.  Sabbath, Kiss, Ozzy, Disturbed, Venom, Merciful Fate.  I mean, stuff that I've always liked.  I have some stuff that I might-  Occasionally a song.  All right.  I do have Jenny from the Block.  I have a few songs.  Really?  Do you really have Jenny from the Block?  Do you listen to that?  Who doesn't?  On Shuffle if it comes on.  So if you see Jim Norton walking around the streets of New York with his iPod on,  there is a slight chance that he may be listening to Jenny from the Block.  Jenny from the Block.  This is what we'll give it away. 
[03:05:00]  If I'm doing the Pulp Fiction dance, I always do that one, Jenny from the Block.  There are a couple of bad ones, you know.  I got a couple of Journey tunes on mine.  That's okay, though.  That's right.  You know what?  I feel like Journey is passable, though.  Yeah.  Soft rock.  Journey was like a rock band at some point in the early 80s.  When they first started, they were like really hard rock.  Yeah.  And then they got-  It was a rock band.  And then they fell into like-  Oh, Sherry. 
[03:05:30]  That's just Steve Perry, though.  Yeah.  That's not with Journey.  Yeah.  That's just Steve Perry solo.  So that, I got to be embarrassed.  You know, I got a Bangles song on there for a little nostalgia.  What do you have?  Which Bangles again?  Which one was it?  We can never remember.  Like an Egyptian?  No, it's not Monday.  No, it wasn't one of those.  Eternal Flame is a good one.  I have those three.  Eternal Flame.  Hazy Shade of Winter?  Yeah, I think it is Hazy Shade of Winter is on there.  Look around.  I bet the Queer Eye guys are having this exact conversation right now.  Yes.  Just sitting around, just five of them sitting around a table. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, they're embarrassed to admit they have an Aussie or a Sabbath or a Zeppelin.  Exactly.  All right.  I have Stairway to Heaven.  Why don't you just go kiss a pussy?  There's that.  There's Tom.  I got Tom Jones.  Little Tom Jones.  Like Delilah.  Is there a sex bomb?  What's great?  Sex bomb.  I think Tom Jones is cool.  Tom Jones is very cool.  He used to pull trains with his son.  Him and his son.  I hope there was a girl in the room.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Tom Jones is a cool dude, man.  Tom Jones, that's kind of cool.  My grandmother loves Tom Jones.  Whose grandmother doesn't?  They all love Tom Jones.  I saw him recently in Atlantic City, and the guy puts on this fucking show.  Yeah.  And girls, old women come up, too.  But there are girls, like, friggin' in their early 20s throwing underwear at the guys still.  Underwear, diapers, the whole gamut of them.  It doesn't matter anything.  A depend undergarment smacks them in the face.  Orthopedic shoe.  Plastic hip.  Let's say hi to Mike in Ohio.  Mike, what's up? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, I just got a question for Joey.  Okay.  We're getting ready to come to New York for the first time this July.  Can you just stop by the restaurant, or do you need to call ahead?  Or, I mean, what kind of places?  I want to go by there, because I hear about it all the time.  No, you just come on in.  We'll take care of you.  All right.  I didn't know if I need to call ahead and make reservations.  You just go through the back door, you go down some stairs, go through the kitchen, and then  Joey will be there with a table, some champagne, and Bobby Vinton will sing to you.  And they prefer a fax, actually.  If you get fax. 
[03:07:30]  I've been talking about you guys for a long time.  I've had XM for a long time.  I've been telling my wife we're going to go there.  So that's the reason we're going to New York soon.  All right.  Cool.  It's Paisanos of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Thanks, Mike.  Let's go to Donner.  Donner, what's up?  Donner.  Donner.  What's your name, bro?  Donner, guys.  Yo.  Damien.  Yo.  What's going on with this new punk music going on on MTV?  Like, panning at the disco on Fall Out Boy.  What do you think about that shit?  First of all, it shouldn't be called punk. 
[03:08:00]  No, it's like pop punk.  Pop punk is pop punk.  They should just get rid of that genre of punk.  They should get rid of it.  Yeah.  It's more of just rock.  Green Day is winning all these punk awards.  It's like Green Day is not punk anymore.  Yeah, they kind of started out as a little punky, but punk is like the Ramones.  It's like the Clash.  That's, you know, I feel like punk can't exist anymore because punk was just a total going  against the disco that was in all the manufactured music.  Then that time is kind of, I think like more sex pistols, you know, and I think even the 
[03:08:30]  Clash had too many hits to be really punk, you know, but not Green Day.  I don't know.  The thing with music is my thing is, is like I've seen like just being in entertainment  and stuff.  You see like bands come and go and stuff.  And I just, in the beginning, I was like, oh, this is, you know, Clay Aiken.  Jesus Christ, you know, get this.  But I'm like, you know, if you can make it and you're successful doing whatever you do,  more power to you.  That guy found his niche, didn't he?  He did.  He did.  And, you know, he's good at what he does.  I'll say the Marines.  The ladies love him.  Niche. 
[03:09:00]  Niche is fleshy and hairy.  He found it.  God bless him.  All right.  Pops out.  Bye.  What do you listen to when you're not doing the MTV thing?  I love U2.  I think they're great.  And I play drums.  So I love Carter from Dave Matthews Band.  I love going to check him out live.  And who else do I listen to?  I listen to old stuff too.  Like when I'm at home and I put the radio on, it's usually on like 104.3, the classic rock station. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Old Clapton, Springsteen, stuff like that.  I wish they'd mix it up a little more though.  Regular radio is so rough to listen to.  Yeah, it really is.  You really don't.  It really is.  Like Q104 here in New York.  It's, you know, man, here it is.  It's cocaine again.  They're good though.  That's like the only station I can really listen to though.  It's like everything else is, you know.  And I hate 2 for Tuesday because every time.  Oh, yeah.  Every time I will hear like a Springsteen song come out. 
[03:10:00]  I am not a Springsteen fan.  Don't like Bruce.  Sorry, Jersey.  I don't like his music.  What's your problem with Bruce?  I don't like the whole.  I just don't like his sound.  I don't like the work in class.  You don't like the storytelling.  The fucking storytelling.  Just give me a song I don't want to hear.  Then I put my Chevy in first gear.  I was headed down toward the shore.  And Wendy was with me.  All right, shut up.  Enough of the story.  All right.  Stop it.  And he just goes on and on. 
[03:10:30]  The songs take forever.  And I'm like the end of the song comes up.  Usually the shower or something.  You can't just switch the station.  And then I'm like, ah, good.  It's over.  And then.  Well, I was out one night and I got a big record deal.  Oh, no.  Another fucking ten minute.  Ten minute story about Jersey.  Pink Cadillac's a good one, though.  No, it isn't.  Pink Cadillac.  Pink Cadillac.  No.  No. 
[03:11:00]  Stop.  I'm not a big Bruce fan.  No.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm not a big Clapton fan either.  I recognize he was very good, but I'm just not a.  I like Clapton.  I just.  I get really tired of the songs that you just hear.  Like Stairway or Pool in the Rain and stuff like that.  You know, yeah.  Layless.  You don't have XM, do you?  What's that?  You don't have XM.  I don't have XM.  Yeah.  You will now.  You will now.  Really?  We will hook you up, my friend.  We're talking about Q104 on our show.  You get an XM.  That's great.  That's great. 
[03:11:30]  That's all I had to do.  That's it.  That's it.  That's great.  Easy as that.  Jim Crow likes animals in his ass.  Let's go to Arthur.  West Virginia.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  What's up?  Don't you hate Perry's?  Well, I'd just like to know her.  You all probably know my wife.  She's Torch Crimson on Pal Talk.  She's who?  Torch Crimson.  Oh, yeah.  Let me look at the one of a thousand people that are on here right now.  Torch Crimson?  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  She's usually on every morning, but I think she's asleep right now.  So I'd just like to send out a happy birthday to her.  I don't know Torch Crimson.  She was one of the women that got the attack.  Yeah.  The other night?  Attacked.  I don't know why it was.  You know something?  You really cannot convey a story.  Well, no, no.  He makes a good point.  Go ahead, sir.  What happened?  Well, I want to say hi and happy birthday to my wife.  Down in Jersey. 
[03:12:30]  See you.  See you.  I appreciate you, boys.  I'm punching out for you.  Yeah, punch out.  You're going in a...  Happy birthday to your wife.  Happy birthday, man.  Yeah.  Hope she gets balloons.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man.  What was it?  I love your show, man.  It's great, dude.  I've been listening to this since I was like in seventh grade, man.  I'm going on 21 this March.  So, anyways, man, I just wanted to say that...  Thanks for reminding us about that time thing.  What is it? 
[03:13:00]  When I was like in third grade, man, until I was like up to like eighth grade, every year  they would make us go to school and have this big-ass thing in like the gym.  And they would have Bruce Springsteen and crap, like all impersonators and shit.  It was so pathetic.  Bruce impersonators?  Yeah, they would have like flying lights and make us sing like along with some gay-ass shit.  Like, I mean, dude, it was like that one...  I went to school on Long Island.  We never had an Eddie Money impersonator come into my school.  Almost as bad as a Bono impersonator.  Yes.  Who would do that? 
[03:13:30]  A couple of Jerry Lee Lewis impersonators as teachers.  Jerry Lee Lewis.  That's what you're looking for.  Vito.  Maybe a Gary Glitter tossed in every now and again.  Computer tech.  Perhaps a Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  Actually, will children fill out of his computer?  Let's go to Vito.  Vito.  Hey, boys.  How you doing, man?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I guess that guy that called, he's that...  His wife's that girl on Pow Talk with the Chevy and one up there on her fupa, you know, 
[03:14:00]  the fat upper pussy area.  But anyway, man, fuck, I forgot why I called, man.  This guy's name's Vito?  Vito.  Vito Corleone.  You and your whole family.  I wanted to ask you, Mr. Paisano, I'm coming up New York, man.  If you can help me whack my wife, man.  Get rid of that bitch.  Uh, Joey, I guess this, uh, you can field this one.  He wants to whack his wife.  Joe, comment?  You're going to have to send that through my MySpace account, please.  Not on the air.  I want to put some cement loafers on that bitch and chuck her fat ass off the dick. 
[03:14:30]  Cement loafers.  Cement loafers.  I want to put some cement loafers on that bitch.  Cement loafers.  You might slip out of those.  They're fucking loafers.  How hard could it be even if they're cement to slip out of them?  Oh, man, she's kind of big, large woman.  She can feed on some of them fishes down there.  Maybe she choked to death or something on the bone.  Jesus.  When did it go bad for you?  I don't know, man.  About day two.  Day two?  Downhill.  What was your wedding song?  Because it all starts with the nice wedding song and then it's downhill from there. 
[03:15:00]  What was your wedding song, sir?  I sobered up on day two and said, holy shit, what happened?  Where'd this fat bitch come from?  Wow.  And how many years in are you?  About two and a half weeks.  Two and a half weeks and he's done?  Oh, my God.  And he wants her whacked?  Yeah, man, we were just in Vegas.  What took you so long?  Yeah, we were in Vegas.  It got out of hand, man, you know.  She had money.  I had nowhere to sleep.  I've never heard a guy like this with an accent like this in Vegas.  No.  It just doesn't happen.  No, you never see it.  Well, you know, we were just kind of like visiting. 
[03:15:30]  It's not like Branson, man, you know.  I mean, Mr. Branson.  Branson.  You might not know there, Mr. Total Request Live.  So you go to Branson.  Oh, wow.  What are you going to take?  Hey, you got balls, Vito.  I like that, Vito.  I'm not going to take that.  This is for you.  Well, what's this world coming to?  Hey, guys, put a sock in that hole before she gets bitten.  All right, Vito.  All right, Vito.  No, we can't help you kill your wife.  Sorry. 
[03:16:00]  Joey's helping us out with other things right now.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, Jimmy, I got a song for you.  All right.  Don't be fooled by the props that I got.  I'm just Jimmy from the block.  I like the hookers who have a cock because that's what I pay for.  Oh, fuck me.  He saw it coming.  That was great.  Oh, did he see it coming?  That was funny.  Oh, fuck me.  What line of the rap did you realize that you were buying? 
[03:16:30]  That wasn't even, I don't even think that was the beat of the song.  It was awful.  The cadence.  He went from so happy to Pesci walking through the door.  Oh, fuck me.  This must bring back a lot of memories.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Right in the face so his mother couldn't see him.  Chris still there?  Chris in Japan?  Chris.  Mau.  He still hasn't hung up.  You wake up now.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll continue with Damien Fahey from MTV.  And Joey from Paisano's and Mulberry Street. 
[03:17:00]  You on the phones.  And everyone that's calling in.  Fred Willard's personal friend, James Norton.  That's right.  Bastard.  And don't forget Bill Burr at Bananas and Poughkeepsie tonight, right?  Yes.  And also, go.  Oh, you got me so bad.  Oh, my God.  Did you guys see Dick Cheney on TV last night talking about how he gunned down that guy?  Oh, boy.  It was on television.  But I think in Cheney's favor, he won everybody over as soon as he flashed that warm Cheney sneer. 
[03:17:30]  And they said that at the ranch down there in Texas where he shot the guy, after the shooting, they had a huge roast beef dinner.  Ah.  A huge roast beef dinner.  This guy's had five heart attacks.  Why is he eating prime rib? 
[03:18:00]  What's that all about?  And a lot of people were suspicious when Cheney said he was going to go on Fox.  And they said, well, is the vice president, this is the question you heard, is the vice president going on Fox just because they're going to ask him softball questions?  That's what everybody thought.  Is he going to just go on Fox because of the softball questions?  And my response to that was, well, does the vice president shoot in the woods?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:18:30]  Greg O.P. Hughes.  Holy crap.  My brain just exploded.  Anthony Koeman.  Wrong idiot.  Bullshit.  James J. Norton.  Hi.  What a faggot.  You stay away from me, Jim Norton.  What?  Hurricane Ben.  Go, go.  It's great.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Martini Steve.  Cozy Lebanese fat fingers.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, Ray.  Shut up, Eric.  White Robin.  Robin.  I invented everything.  Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him, Fred. 
[03:19:00]  Opian Anthony.  I'm scared.  breaking news on the opium anthony program  by the way damian fahey hanging out with us he's a friend of the show  yeah you'll be hearing from him uh a lot in the coming months i think there's a place for you  i love this i love this show let's do it for a while it's nice to be here nice check him out  on trl but uh anthony's getting some news from the pal talk people uh yes i was just informed by uh 
[03:19:30]  one of the generals dug out doug frightening human being by the way i got doug uh a cease and desist  what they call a cnd has been issued uh allegedly rumors i haven't gotten confirmation but i believe  doug uh that they are no longer allowed to stream serious satellite radio content over pal talk 
[03:20:00]  which uh is directly because of what what the pests were doing of course pharrell's radio show  the guy who's drawing it the guy who said bring it on yeah the guy that said bring it on looks like  he went to his bosses and went wah wah wah cried to his bosses i can't do a show i can't take a phone  call uh oh i'll be an anthony's passer on my ass i can't do anything i got no show i can't and he  cried to his boss uh they sent out a cease and desist which is the opening salvo in a legal case 
[03:20:30]  usually means nothing because people usually cease and desist from what they were doing um uh so  apparently if anybody if anybody streams any serious content over pal talk uh they can be sued  um whatever so they're going to be closing down rooms that stream uh serious content and the only 
[03:21:00]  reason we're bringing this up is because we need a plan b uh that's the only reason doug has said a  plan b is in place not to worry people will still gather in the pal talk rooms because it's a lot of  fun to discuss the various ideas that people want to do but the stream will come from elsewhere and it  will go elsewhere and and the people will still be able to hear the show without paying for serious  satellite radio as last night one thousand people let's do a little math here one thousand people 
[03:21:30]  and i'm rounding it uh low because it was over it was about thirteen hundred people but a thousand  people were listening to serious without paying serious a fucking dime without paying them a dime  uh to listen uh how much did they lose hmm thousand subs what does that come out to that's a lot of cash  and um i guess they were a little upset by that a little insecure and they put out a cease and desist  but and how was the fight last night fight last night uh pharrell had to change his show completely 
[03:22:00]  he was staging calls he was uh planting calls people that weren't gonna blurt out opian anthony or show  references references and dumping and fucking dumping dumping out until he felt uh it was safe  he thought he had chased away the pests with his uh set up phone calls the first regular natural call  he plunked down was a pest uh the second one from that another pest they just wouldn't leave him alone 
[03:22:30]  took him out of his game completely he had to discuss uh news of the world with the hole that he's got  uh with him and uh it just didn't work out it was horrid horrific uh radio stream of unconsciousness  the pests realize they're winning right yeah they're winning this battle just because and a lot of people  were frustrated they were like oh man we can't get on the air we can't get the clips on that's not even  the point we enjoy playing the clips of you guys on there uh but the the mission here is to destroy 
[03:23:00]  his show you're doing that even when the calls don't make the air you're tying up his screener  you're keeping real calls from getting through and you're annoying the piss out of this guy and the  focus of everybody in that crew including him is on you and not letting you through it's not doing  his dumb show and it's not talking to that broad he hired it's just keeping you off the air becomes  the focus of that god awful and we found out the phone screener is now doing a scott farrell voice yeah  this is how they got through the screener they quickly figured this out the phone screener was  picking up the call and going hey farrell you're on the air and then the person on the phone would talk 
[03:23:30]  and then give away because they would uh blur it out an ona reference and the screener would hang  up guy was never on the air so they got on to him and they just had a conversation and at some point  during the conversation the screener would go all right look this isn't farrell or just hang on  we'll get you on the air uh so they were able to get pests on the air that way they got through the  screeners there's always a way to get by these screeners and the pests are geniuses at figuring this  out and it will continue pharrell edge the cnd isn't going to stop it i just did the howie math 
[03:24:00]  a thousand people listening to sirius for free equals one billion dollars in losses opie they lost a  billion dollars last night alone in revenue uh from sirius one billion that's true it's howie math  howie math we use the howie later let's say hi to dug out doug doug and these guys think that  they're good implementing operation faker where they put the screener on the phone yes to be pharrell  but we sniffed it out phillips did this and we know how much of a piece of shit phillips is 
[03:24:30]  we just adjust like the borg and we get around it doug how how funny was it when the guy from canada  called and uh i thought it was a boring canadian call about hockey and he ended it with  grr and then the very next call i'm laughing i'm howling the very next call he takes he goes i let's  go all right let's go to the call take the call from modesto when he said fucking modesto i lost my  mind he goes uh scott you're on the air scott from modesto who then uh proceeded to ask him how big his 
[03:25:00]  mouth was to fit howard's fat cock and it's here's the call right here here it is modesto can i get  can i get that guy let's go scott go ahead hey how are you i'm pretty good how are you i'm good  all right i'm just curious is your jaws hurt from sucking our dick off it does actually because he's  got a big girthy one and when i stuff it in there sometimes i get lockjaw on it then i just pass it 
[03:25:30]  over to lynn she finishes she puts mustard on it though she prefers mustard generally on hers you know  what i mean no he's got that nervous kind of trying to get through this and make it work for  himself thing but no he's losing his mind he's losing it people hey uh doug so what's the latest  uh guys you really gotta question the friendship that you guys actually had with this guy if it's  night five of the attack and he still doesn't know scott from modesto is a joke and he's still  letting on steve from yellowstone yeah i never listened to your show in the past year and a half 
[03:26:00]  he's just a dummy next call should be from the entire yates family  call him up from the tub don't worry about the pal talk thing um the pal talk was actually a really  easy way for us to get this done yeah but we've had other ways for years now we'll get we got it  all set up already yeah and one word of advice to the callers who do a great job  don't set yourself up by going hey scott just one thing i don't because a lot of times that's kind 
[03:26:30]  of a giveaway that you're about to smash him yep just do it in legitimate conversation like go dude  i'm trying to watch a flyers game and i want to know what's going on you suck ramoon in the middle  of a sentence and then watch him dump out and go hey ramones listen to the ramones i hit a dump button  and have a hole sitting next to me burst right in i also noticed that the pests have a little bit of  a problem of realizing they're on the air like scott will say you're on the air and there'll be a big  delay a big gap they're they're listening to the feed instead of the phone yeah if you're not like 
[03:27:00]  right on the spot with him uh he's gonna hang up on because he's a maverick oh he's a wild man why  is he so upset with you guys i don't understand what happened there was no reason that he went  over to sirius which like we said is fine jim brewer's over there we got no problem with brewer  love the guy uh he's never bashed our show but he felt by going over to sirius that in order to make  points over there he had to uh go on his website and just write this whole thing about how howard's  going to kick our ass uh and then he gets on the air and talks about how we suck and we're imitators 
[03:27:30]  and this comes from someone you thought was your friend which is yeah this is a guy you know we  hung out with he's a bottom feeder someone's saying that in the office today yeah he's just a bottom  feeder what he is is he's just a fucking middle-aged flop who's desperate to get a job and he's a jerk  off he's burned a lot of bridges in the business and he's burned the biggest one so good luck jerk off  good luck with the career after this one scott and uh whatever the c and d you're running he ran to  his boss uh whatever you got the cease and desist we knew that was going to happen but uh the pests 
[03:28:00]  adapt they are uh they like the aids virus well they just adapt these guys are a bunch of phonies  they say stuff like bring it on bring bring it on you got always say bring it on and then behind  the scenes they're working legally to try to figure out how to stop it so he can still do it do you have  the c and d doug uh no uh a gentleman on pal talk uh he's a pal talk admin named swift uh just  instant messaged me right before i uh messaged anthony yeah i'd love to get a hold of them yeah 
[03:28:30]  i'd love to get a look at it why don't we send it to steve so we get posted and show you how brave  scott is and the gang at the the little doggy company but guys they don't listen i mean they  don't listen to your show how would they know we were on pal talk yeah they don't listen oh they must  listen really fucking closely actually if you're gonna figure that one out isn't radio the dumbest  like business where it's i i i said this past three days it's it's like professional wrestling  is the only other job where your friend all of a sudden hits you in the face with a chair yeah 
[03:29:00]  there's no other business you're not you don't work like at the cubicle at ibm and you're typing and  stuff and like uh bob yeah we're going out uh after work for a couple of beers yeah you got that memo  that i sent over and bob bob bob bob just started beating the guy yes salt in the eyes let me tell  you something brother yeah i got that memo and it just it's all bob's fans out there yeah screw you  yeah bob is mine i own bob it's like what why is wrestling and radio the only two fucking occupations
