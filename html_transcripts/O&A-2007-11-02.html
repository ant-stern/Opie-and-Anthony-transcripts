<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a lengthy, self-referential intro boasting their status as shock jocks, followed by a discussion about expanding their already elaborate intro.  They outlined their Friday segments: "FU Friday" (listener calls),  "Point and Laugh Friday,"  "E-Rock," the possibly bi-weekly "Is Tom Alive Friday," and the new "Fart Friday" (to become "Fart Trivia").  They graphically detailed a video of a man's reaction to "Two Girls, One Cup," and mentioned a conflict with their "Drama Queen" New York City producer.

The show then transitioned to listener calls concerning the shooting death of a police officer in a Dunkin' Donuts. Corey from Philadelphia discussed the crime details and lack of arrests, touching on "stop and frisk" and the public's muted response.  Officer Anthony expressed concern over rising police killings. Ed offered a perspective on Giuliani's "stop and frisk" policy in New York.  The hosts criticized Reverend Al Sharpton's lack of attention to the Philadelphia situation.  A $1,000 contest was announced, triggered by a specific audio cue, and their security detail, "Master Poe," was discussed.  Shane, a Philadelphia police officer, called in to provide donation information for the fallen officer's family, with the hosts later correcting the phone number.  They speculated on Howard Stern's radio return.  Fireman Sean expressed appreciation for the show's support of law enforcement.

A substantial portion focused on the Dog the Bounty Hunter controversy, analyzing a leaked audio recording of him using racial slurs.  They debated the ethics of leaking private conversations and the potential fallout for Chapman and A&E.  The show promoted Jim Norton's stand-up show and further listener calls.  The death of Paul Tibbetts, the Hiroshima bomber, was also discussed, including speculation on his post-war life and whether he ate sushi.

The conversation shifted to a list of the "10 Manliest Video Games Ever," which the hosts mocked as outdated. They critiqued games like *Pro Wrestling*, *Double Dragon*, *Counter-Strike*, and the controversial *Custer's Revenge*, playing audio clips from the Angry Video Game Nerd's review.  *Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!* and *Contra* were also mentioned.  The "F.U. Line" segment followed, with a listener winning $1,000.  Anecdotes from a celebrity softball game were shared, including Jim Norton's frustration over being benched for wearing Doc Martens.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal joined the discussion, contributing to the Dog the Bounty Hunter conversation and the debate on family loyalty versus reporting criminal activity.  They discussed hypothetical actions if a family member committed a serious crime, *Custer's Revenge*, the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, and comedian Vinny Brand.

A significant portion dealt with a racist reality TV star and the ethical dilemma of continuing to air the show.  Highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes were used.  Anthonyâ€™s bizarre Super Bowl prediction system was detailed, employing offensive language and stereotypes.  Patrice O'Neal promoted his podcast, mentioning its shocking content, including a "Pittens" segment about staged kitten fights.  The hosts and O'Neal discussed Angry Video Game Nerd's reviews of Atari pornographic games, using explicit language. They promoted their upcoming stand-up shows and described an awkward trip to XM Satellite Radio studios.

Chris Jericho, promoting his book "A Lion's Tale," was a guest. He discussed his wrestling career, the writing process, being fired from his XM radio show, "The Rock of Jericho," and anecdotes from his life. The conversation included discussion of hair metal bands, playful banter with racial humor, and memories of Jericho's earlier appearance as Moon Goose McQueen. His relationship with Chris Benoit, a photo from Owen Hart's funeral in his book, and the physical and mental demands of wrestling were also covered.  He recounted wrestling with a broken arm and being held at gunpoint in Mexico.  Speculation about his WWE return, fueled by caller Sam Roberts's "2-2-2" campaign, ensued.

A later segment with Jericho focused on his wrestling career, Vince McMahon's reactions, and the impact of Chris Benoit's death. Jericho discussed book signings.  The hosts recounted graphic details of urinating together, leading to vulgar jokes.  A heated exchange between O'Neal and Norton erupted, involving insults, accusations, threats, and a woman unexpectedly stripping naked in the studio.  The argument covered Norton's personal life and family before resolving (temporarily).  A clip of a crying wrestling fan was played, followed by more wrestling discussion.  The show concluded with a final heated exchange between O'Neal and Norton, but ended on a calmer note, with caller "Sam" asking awkward questions.

The final segment featured an escalating, vulgar back-and-forth between Jericho, O'Neal, and Jimmy, involving insults about physical appearance, sexual orientation, and concentration camps.  Security was called unnecessarily, becoming a running gag.  Mistaken identity jokes, comparing Jericho to Ellen DeGeneres, were prevalent.  The discussion included Jericho's potential wrestling return, their comedic styles, and a "line of the day" segment.  The show ended with them promoting their upcoming events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 to my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going. 
[00:01:00]  They are sick, free.  So you're kind of like transvestite.  Transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've seen.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, my God.  I almost forgot.  Oh.  Personal thought.  Oh, say, can you see me by the starly lights?  For the ramparts we watch, with some gallantly gleaming. 
[00:02:00]  And the rocket's red glare, God's words bursting in air, gave proof to the light, that our flag was still there.  Oh, say, does that star-spin the banner yet wave? 
[00:02:30]  For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  It's showtime.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  Know what we've got to do in the very near future?  We've got to kind of add to the intro.  We were kind of joking about it the other day, like we want a three-hour intro.  Yeah.  That just plays, and then when the intro's over, we say, good morning and goodbye.  Yeah.  But one of these days in the very near future, we've got to try to add to what we have already  and see how long we can go before it's not interesting anymore.  Because right now, you've got that weird production that the New York City station does before we come on the air.  Before they push the on switch for the syndicated show, that is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:30]  And just let it roll.  Then it's the self-serving intro that pretty much tells the country that we're shock jocks.  And that we're the greatest shock jocks and the last shock jocks still on the radio.  And then, what, we play a little Ecstasy of Gold in there.  Mm-hmm.  And the intro, and now we've got Star Spangled Banner.  We're trying to figure out, now we've played the It's Friday clip.  I think we could stretch this out to a good 15, 20 minutes. 
[00:04:00]  Before it gets, like, stupid?  No, it's already stupid.  Right.  Well, we can stretch it out.  I don't want people turning off their radios.  I want to be able to expand it and see how far we can go before people are like,  all right, look, I've got to go to the sports station.  I'm at it with you guys.  I don't know.  Just a dumb idea to start the show today.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  It's FU Friday.  It's a Friday thing.  FU Friday.  I haven't heard any real complaints, though.  Everyone's happy.  Now we've got the FU line, and we'll sweep together a bunch of the better phone calls today,  a little later on in the program.  It's also Air Guitar Friday.  Is it time to just get rid of Air Guitar Friday?  Yeah, retire that one.  Huh?  I forgot it existed.  I know. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's why I'm bringing it up.  I guess that's a good time to get rid of it.  All right.  Air Guitar Friday for the people keeping track at home is no longer happening.  Do you remember what it was?  I don't remember what it was.  We would just, like, jam.  Yeah, we would come back from break with some cool songs, and it was just your chance to  let your freak flag fly, man.  Be a guitar god.  Be a guitar god.  Just rock. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  To just rock.  Yeah, everyone wants to just rock every once in a while.  It's also Point and Laugh Friday.  We can't get rid of that one.  No, that's a good one.  That's a staple of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the E-Rock.  Also known as...  He becomes a victim of that every show.  Yeah, the E-Rock bit.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Are we off or on for this week?  Well, he was in such bad shape last week, we decided we want to do Is Tom Alive Friday 
[00:06:00]  every other Friday.  But after the phone call last week, I'm thinking we might have to go back to doing it every week.  Yeah, he was in real bad shape.  He was all wheezing.  What's Steve doing?  I'll call...  Wait, let me guess.  Nothing.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Whatsoever.  But you're standing like awkwardly while we're trying to broadcast.  I was just listening.  I was handing you a note, but I realized it was already on the sheet in front of you.  But then the Is Tom Alive thing came up and I wanted to make sure that we had his number.  That's all.  Thank you, Steve. 
[00:06:30]  What was the note?  Is it private?  This chicken scratches you?  No, that's Dan.  Oh.  What's your note?  I don't see no note.  Oh, I threw it out because it was already on the sheet in front of you.  What does Danny's note say?  Is it help me on a gin bottle like in The Exorcist?  All right.  So, Is Tom Alive Friday, we might have to get an update today because he was really, really  in bad shape last week.  And knowing he'll either be better or worse. 
[00:07:00]  It's one or the other.  He's either going to sound better or worse.  I think with Is Tom Alive Friday, we got to play it, you know, like, I think we need  an update today.  And if he's sounding pretty good, then maybe we'll, you know, give it a couple weeks.  All right?  Okay.  So, Tom, if you're listening, you know, please give us a call today so we know you're alive.  And, of course, it's also Fart Friday.  Now, this is brand new.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Fart Friday because fart equals funny.  You know, fart and puke-ing equals funny.  Absolutely.  But it is Fart Friday.  Bobby puking is probably one of the funniest sounds I've ever heard.  I watched that video of his reaction to, let me see, Two Girls, One Cup.  Right.  That's it.  And I couldn't get enough of it.  Just kept playing it over and over again.  Yeah.  For the people that haven't checked it out yet, you really have to. 
[00:08:00]  It's up on YouTube.  It's up on our website.  It's called Two Girls, One Cup, Bob Kelly Reaction, I believe, right?  Yeah.  It is really funny.  A lot of people are making these type of videos across America, but we have the best one.  The best one.  By far.  No one's topping that.  By far the best one.  Other people just kind of hold their hand over their mouth.  They get a little gaggy.  Yeah.  But he's just retching.  Yeah.  It's really, really fun.  It gets funnier the more you watch it.  Oh, yeah.  That's why.  Every time you watch it, there's a part where it's just, you know, makes that sound. 
[00:08:30]  And the video, Two Girls, One Cup, we just can't even explain it.  No.  Literally, we can't explain it.  We'd love to.  I think you could get arrested for explaining it even in your own home.  Yeah.  It is that disgusting and wrong.  How could something so disgusting appear to be so delicious in that cup?  Are you talking about two girls?  Yes, yes.  Two girls, one cup.  It just, it really, it looks like you would just take it out to your car on a summer day. 
[00:09:00]  Like moose.  Right.  It looks like a chilled moose treat.  Like it's not freezing, but maybe it was in the fridge for a bit.  Chilled.  And you shake it and it kind of warbles in a moose-like fashion.  Delicious.  A little whipped cream on it.  Mmm.  Horrid.  Well.  Horrid.  So, Fart Friday is in effect.  And we're going to do Fart Trivia.  We should try to do Fart Trivia next Friday.  Trivia?  We should get it done. 
[00:09:30]  We've got to do Fart Trivia next Friday.  Right.  You know, but our PD.  Like Jeopardy.  Our PD here in New York has decided not to help us anymore, so we might have to take up  a collection from the listeners to get money or something for a prize.  She has indeed disappeared.  Yeah, she's teaching us.  Since we had that little altercation during one of the breaks.  Yeah, Drama Queen has decided not to help the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  Drama Queen has decided to just avoid us at all costs.  Is that like a get us back thing? 
[00:10:00]  I guess so.  Because that's worked so well in the past with you and I.  And PDs.  I think she's like playing a little game of, I'll show them.  I'll show them.  Please don't show us.  It just doesn't work.  It never works.  We don't give anything much thought and we don't care.  It's just the way to understand the personalities you're working with.  I'll show them.  Oh, I'll leave you alone. 
[00:10:30]  Let me do my line again.  You do me, Ant.  And you can do it psychotic if you like.  Let me see.  God, I keep forgetting the line.  I get it all twisted up with them.  I looked at her with clenched teeth during the break and said, leave me alone.  Do that line.  Leave me alone.  And me as the Drama Queen.  Oh, I'll leave you alone. 
[00:11:00]  The stomp.  And unfortunately, people can't see the awful walk away.  It's not a regular walk.  It's a walk with the arms flailing left and right.  I hope he's doing an awful stomping walk.  Of dejection.  I get it.  You're teaching us a lesson.  Yeah.  You're hoping we come running down the hall begging then you come back.  Go away.  It's never worked in the past. 
[00:11:30]  Who are you kidding?  So I guess we'll just take up a collection.  Yeah.  And we'll have our own prize for Fark Trivia, hopefully next Friday.  Yes.  All right.  What else did I want to say?  Let's say hi to Corey in Philly.  Corey, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, Philly?  Hey, man, man.  I'm not going to turn on FM anymore in Philly, but it needs to be said that a cop that was shot  yesterday died yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A cop got shot in the head.  Was it a Dunkin' Donuts, Corey? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, it was Dunkin' Donuts.  He walked into a...  The cop was walking in.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, the cop was walking in as the robber was attempting to take the money and then he  shot him point blank in the face.  Right away, they came back and stole his gun.  Was the cop on duty or was he just walking in off duty?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was on duty.  Well, he was responding to a call.  Wasn't the Dunkin' Donuts being held up or something?  I don't think so.  Because we were out there watching the tapes and it looked like the cop walked in the same  time that the robber did.  Oh, great. 
[00:12:30]  He might have just been stopping for coffee.  So that stupid robber, like the cop walked in and the robber knew he was there and still  robbed the store?  Yeah.  And then shot him point blank in the head.  No, he just...  He had the hood on and had his back turned towards him.  And I guess when you don't see him, actually shoot him in the face.  But he turned around and that's when he shot him in the face and then rolled out.  And then he came back and stole his gun?  Yep.  It's just scary what's going on in the city.  There were 300 murders.  Cops getting shot now.  It's just...  It's ridiculous.  Now, look...  I think this is the third police shooting in a week down there in Philly, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, he was the fourth.  The fourth?  Meanwhile, now the cops pull you over and jack you up or smash you, right?  Oh, where are the rights?  Yeah, where's the protest?  And this cop that died, he was on the force for what?  21 years, sir?  20, 25 years.  25 years on the force.  Seasoned veteran.  Oh, yeah.  And that's how he goes out.  Do they have any idea who did it?  No.  There's a...  Sorry, guys.  I'm real nervous right now.  There's a reward for like $115,000 plus other unions that are associated with the police. 
[00:13:30]  The FOP are putting money in towards it also.  Hoping that somebody will snitch on the guy.  Yeah, hopefully some fellow scum...  I can't even say it.  And are you...  He is.  We'll get the reward money.  How do you know so much about this, Corey?  I got plenty of my friends who are cops in the city.  One of them is real close.  He was partners with them back in the day.  And I don't know.  It's just scary.  I mean, if the brothers are going to kill the brothers, that's one thing. 
[00:14:00]  But when they turn around and kill the cops, you know, guys who are just out there trying  to keep us all safe, that takes it to a whole new level.  Well, what the hell are they going to do down there?  Well, we've got that new mayor coming in, Michael Nutter.  He wants to do that stop and frisk thing.  And pretty much everybody who is not doing illegal crimes has no problem with it.  But it's all the people who are up to the illegal crap are the ones that are up in arms about  it going on.  It's just a stop and frisk thing where they can just roll up to you, just stop, talk to 
[00:14:30]  you, frisk you, make sure you have no illegal guns or drugs or anything on you.  That'll probably never fly.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to go.  That'll never fly.  Isn't that what happened with you guys up in New York when Giuliani came in?  Did he do something like that?  He did a quality of life crimes thing where Rudy, you know, it was like they were just  busted pot dealers and like little softer crimes, like, you know, hookers and stuff like  that.  And they're like, why don't you concentrate on the big things?  And he was saying it's like a quality of life thing.  But I don't know if they had to stop and frisk thing.  If they did, I don't know it.  So I basically just talked for no reason. 
[00:15:00]  There seems to be a little constitutional problem there.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  If you could just stop and frisk people without cause, you know.  What they were going to do here after 9-11, it was like last year, a year ago, two years ago,  they wanted to be able to search your book bags or whatever, or your things in the train  station.  Yeah.  Because they were worried about an attack.  I don't even know if that was allowed or not.  That was a problem.  Well, we got to find this cop killer, Corey.  Absolutely.  How do you donate to the fund?  Honestly, I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I know they have a lot of the local news agencies. 
[00:15:30]  It would be like NBC10.  Right.  They probably have, you know, information to help capture the guy or, you know, donating towards  the fund.  Is there an official fund?  Because I have no problem throwing money at that.  I haven't heard anything.  If you get some info, please call us back.  Absolutely, fellas.  All right.  Yeah, you got it.  We got to find the cop killer down there in Philly.  It's ridiculous.  Don't they have, like, the surveillance tapes and all that?  They do.  They sent the tapes out to the FBI to enhance the video. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Surveillance video is the worst video.  They're getting better.  It's so bad.  But not everyone has the latest equipment.  That's the problem.  Because you see some of the surveillance videos, and you're like, wow, we've come a long way.  Cop killers usually get caught.  Cop killers usually get caught because the cops turn the place upside down.  Oh, yeah.  They will get them.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if you guys watch that show, Forensic Files, but the guy, stupidly enough, robbed the same Dunkin' Donuts back in September.  Right.  And when he did that, he took his sweater off and just left it at the scene. 
[00:16:30]  So I don't know if there's any way of getting DNA or sweat off of that to find out who he is.  Right, right.  But, yeah, this is a black guy wearing a black hood, so it's really hard to, you know, see him on the tape.  That stop-and-frisk thing, they should just hire me.  Like, I can point people out.  I'll point, you search them.  Guaranteed every time you'll find a problem.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  How are you?  I bet I can do that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hire me, Philly. 
[00:17:00]  How would you do it?  I would look around, and I would go, that guy, go ahead, frisk him.  How would you determine?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'd use a lot of different techniques that I would be able to just look and know  that there's a problem.  That's all.  You can usually tell if there's going to be some kind of problem.  Oh, my God.  How?  I don't know.  It's an instinct.  It's more instinctual than anything else. 
[00:17:30]  But I would look and go, okay, officer, I would search that guy, and then guarantee they'd  probably find something.  Do you think you actually know something they don't?  You don't think they could do the exact same thing, but they're not allowed to?  They could, but some people have a better talent with this instinct than others.  You know, some people actually have some kind of ESP, you know?  I have, like, an ESP when it comes to that.  I could just look and kind of know there's a problem there. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  What?  You're crazy, man.  Ah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Woodbridge.  Anthony, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  How you doing?  What are you doing?  I wasn't in Woodbridge.  You're Anthony from Long Island.  Right.  This is Anthony from Woodbridge.  Damn it.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey, what's going on?  From Woodbridge.  Hey.  I just want to comment, man.  We go over the numbers every night.  I'm a police officer out here. 
[00:18:30]  A cop, you idiot.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  This has to be the highest of our cops on duty that are killed in the line of duty in  a very long time.  It's getting ridiculously scary high that cops are just getting shot on duty.  And, you know, hats off to that officer's family and, you know, all the brothers out  there in Philadelphia, man.  It's rough.  Yeah, it's rough.  When people are just shooting cops on duty in uniform, that is frightening, man. 
[00:19:00]  It's jacked up, man.  You know, I thank God I'm able to come home and kiss my wife, you know, and see my kids.  And it's crazy.  Yeah.  Is there a phone that you could donate to?  I need to know.  You know what?  I haven't really heard anything.  It's, you know, if we could get contact with Philadelphia, I mean, if they need anything,  you know, they give us a call.  But, you know, we really don't hear anything.  On donations and stuff like that.  Right.  If you contact Philadelphia, they could probably give you a better explanation of what to do. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Okay.  All right, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Ed in Queens.  Tops.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ed.  I just found about what the guy from Philly was talking about with Giuliani.  Yeah.  The stop question in first care in New York.  He's actually correct.  When Giuliani did come in, there was a big surge to have cops on the show, a former police  here in New York. 
[00:20:00]  Cops go out and stop people because they had recently eliminated, at the point, the street  crime unit after the Diallo shooting.  All the numbers were low for the UF-250s, they're called, the stop question and frisk report.  So basically, there was a big surge for guys to go out there.  But what happened is, because of the racial profiling issues that were brought up, they  had a monitoring on the same UF-250s that cops were preparing.  And they actually broke them down to see who was being stopped. 
[00:20:30]  So, let me ask you a question.  This was all during the Dinkins administration, right?  Dinkins.  I mean, it started a long time ago, stopping people on the street.  No, I mean the breakdown of that unit.  Like, you said that they disbanded kind of that unit after the Diallo shooting.  That was on the Dinkins watch?  I believe it was after.  Okay.  But that's basically, you know, why the numbers were low, that they need to maintain a certain 
[00:21:00]  watermark with all these reports.  And basically, what happens is, as guys aren't stopped on the street, that means guns aren't  being taken off the street.  And once the street crime unit here in New York was disbanded, who were responsible for  collecting 90% of illegal guns in New York City off the street, basically what happened  to have an increase in shootings.  So, basically, it self-destructed itself because of the racial profiling issue, which is brought  up by the people in the street who want the criminals out there. 
[00:21:30]  And they want the drug dealers to continue because they bring in the most money in their  community, and they're the ones that support them.  So, they need to protest against the police in their own mind.  Right.  They're taking bread and butter out of their community.  So, most of the people that are against these type of things, you know, they support the  criminals.  You know what's interesting about this whole thing?  I mean, Reverend Al's community is in a complete mess down there in Philly.  But what is Reverend Al doing today? 
[00:22:00]  You know, he's all over the whole IMAS thing, because IMAS is officially coming back to radio  in a month.  Yeah, there's the problem.  Why don't you go after a real issue there, Reverend Al?  Unbelievable.  Why don't you just send your people down to Philly and have a nice protest and try to figure  out what to do down there, because it is, if you do a little reading about what's going  on in Philly, it is insane how out of control it is down there.  Well, he'll go down there when one cop hits a guy with a nightstick, and they'll cry police  brutality, and that's when they'll show up. 
[00:22:30]  They're in a no-win scenario.  They go in in force to really, like, clean up a neighborhood, and they're accused of all  kinds of crimes.  And then if they stay out of the neighborhood because, screw this, I'm not going to get  thrown in prison for my job or shot, then people are like, oh, there's no police presence.  That's why everybody's getting killed.  So, no matter what they do, they can't win.  There you go.  Reverend Al, there you go.  There's your next assignment.  Go down to Philly and try to figure out some stuff.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Leave this stupid radio crap alone.  Enough already.  Go do something real with your, quote, power.  Deal with real things.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kind of a strange way to start today, but that's fine by us, man.  Yeah, that cop did die, and we were kind of talking about that the last couple days here  on the show.  And I need to know what the fund is.  How do they do that?  I don't know.  I'm sure if you go to...  They get collections up, and if you're the guy that turns in this cop killer, you make 
[00:23:30]  some fine money.  I have no problem throwing a few bucks at that, but I don't know how to do it.  I'm sure if you Google News the situation, you'll find info.  Some kind of fun?  All right.  We'll figure that out.  We have lots to do today.  Why don't we take a quick break?  You want to play the sound that people are listening for today for the $1?  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I believe it has something to do with Poe Vember.  Yeah.  Our own Master Poe, our trained killer that kind of...  I don't know what he does, really, but he does stuff for us.  Here's what he does.  He wears an odd-looking suit jacket, and when we walk into XM, he has a fist up, and we 
[00:24:00]  bump fists, and he goes, good morning, gentlemen.  And then when you go to the restroom, Poe walks you to the bathroom because you could  be attacked in the Steinway building, walking 30 feet to the bathroom.  Yeah.  And he holds the door open for you, but it's always a dramatic thing.  He'll swashbuckle the door open.  It's like, what are you doing?  Swashbuckle it open.  You don't need to karate the door open.  I've done this before.  He kind of has a Matrix look to him, just like Ronnie B said the other day.  Yeah.  That's how he comes to Matrix. 
[00:24:30]  And then after the radio show, he walks us up the sidewalk, and what's really strange,  he is like the mayor of the sidewalk now.  People will come out of buildings and go to Master Poe.  And they go, oof.  Oof.  And Master Poe goes back to him, oof, and continues walking.  And then we go another 10 feet, and there's another, like, doorman.  Oof.  Yeah.  And then Master Poe goes, oof.  I don't know what the hell he's doing, but he's making friends everywhere.  Yeah.  It's really, really strange.  They don't know what it is either.  They just know that the kook in the leather jacket is happy when they say oof. 
[00:25:00]  And that's what they know.  They don't know why, but he says oof.  He's a sociopath.  They can see it because he doesn't blink enough.  Yeah, there you go.  Poe is nuts.  He's a strange one.  But here's what you're listening for today between 7 and 7.30.  You're the best around.  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.  There you go.  And when you hear that, be the 10th caller,  and you will win the $1,000 that we have for you today. 
[00:25:30]  Okay?  Nice.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We appreciate the listen.  We got a guy named Shane on the line.  He talked to you, Ed.  He's a cop.  Ah.  Shane, what's up, buddy? 
[00:26:00]  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  There he is.  What's up, man?  Listen, I talked to you the other day.  My buddy Jimmy gave you the phone.  Yeah.  It was in the middle of a real bad day,  and it was nice talking.  It cheered me up a little bit.  I just wanted to thank you for it.  Oh, I'm glad, man.  Yeah, that's a bitch.  Unbelievable.  What are you doing?  Like, you scouring the city?  Right now, everybody who's working or not working is out looking. 
[00:26:30]  It's just one of those things.  I mean, this was a guy that was very well-loved, very well-respected.  You know, it's just one of them things.  But if you guys wanted to throw something towards his family's fund,  you can call the Philadelphia FOP, 629-3100.  What's the area code, sir, for the rest of the country?  Oh, I'm sorry, 215.  All right, wait a minute.  So, 215. 
[00:27:00]  Go ahead.  629.  629.  3100.  And you call that number,  and they'll tell you how you can donate to the Charles Cassidy Family Memorial Trust Fund?  Yeah, that's the Philadelphia Paternal Order Police Lodge 5.  Give them a call.  They can give you all the directions.  But, like I said, I just wanted to...  I have an address, too.  I mean, and I'm sending a check, like, immediately.  So, this is definitely the right address?  901 Arch?  901 Arch Street, Philadelphia?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  That's our credit union.  I believe they're working as a clearinghouse for it.  All right.  So, if you want to send a check to the Charles Cassidy Family Memorial Trust Fund,  this is the cop that got shot, and he ended up dying yesterday down there in Philly.  It's the Charles Cassidy Family Memorial Trust Fund.  You can mail it to 901 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19107.  Or you can give them a call, well, the FOP a call, 215-629-3100.  And I'm not just talking a good game. 
[00:28:00]  I'm sending a check immediately, because this crap just should not happen ever.  Yeah, he was shot by a cockroach who was robbing a store.  Yeah.  And I hope people follow my lead.  I'll be sending a check immediately.  All right, Shane.  Hang in there, all right?  Thanks a lot, guys.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Shane from Philly, he's on the job down there.  All right.  It's kind of awkward to move on, but we're going to move on to other things today.  It is a great day to be a radio talk show host, because Fareed, who runs Citadel, hired Imus 
[00:28:30]  officially, and Imus is coming back to radio, I believe, December 3rd, a month from tomorrow.  The first guest I hear is the dog.  I have the dog on.  They're going to chat.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine?  That's very funny.  How funny would that be?  Everyone would just be staring at their radio like, what?  Their jaws drop to the ground.  Michael Richards and then the dog. 
[00:29:00]  We've got an action-packed show today, a lot of guests.  Yeah, Michael Richards, Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Let's bring in Michael Richards and then Dog the Bounty Hunter is going to come in, and  we're going to go over his phone call, and I don't see what's wrong with it.  Imagine.  See no problem with it.  And then after that, we'll have him.  Son's a spoiled little brat.  But after that, we'll have Anthony Cumia.  Anthony will come on, give his opinions on how he can just seem to point out guilty people. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's a great day to be a radio talk show host.  There's a company out there that's not scared of controversy.  So what?  A mere seven, eight months later, Imus is back on the radio.  That's really, really good news for broadcasters.  Everyone knew he'd be back.  Everyone knew he'd be back.  Come on.  I think he'd have to sit for a couple years, though.  It was Imus.  Did he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  And Reverend Al, he's going to be paying close attention to make sure Imus changed. 
[00:30:00]  And if Imus didn't change, then he's going to get his people protesting and boycotting  and calling the advertisers.  Shut up.  He's in the papers saying all this crap today while Philly's in disarray.  He'll ignore that situation down there because that's hard stuff.  That's hard stuff to try to figure out.  It's easy to go after an old white shock jock for some throwaway comment.  Yeah.  Really old white shock jock.  Right.  Really old.  He's like, Imus is pushing 70.  Calm down. 
[00:30:30]  But to actually go into some of these communities and really try to get something done, that's  too much effort.  That's too much work.  And it turns your constituency against you.  Right.  Because you're an Uncle Tom is what they call you if you actually criticize your own community  instead of taking responsibility for it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  He's a phony.  Wouldn't it be funny if Imus just went on the air and started trashing other shock jocks  and destroyed this show?  What pigs we are?  Imagine he changed so much. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like, what?  But Imus.  What slobs we are.  We were the only show that supported you all these months.  What are you doing to us?  That would be something Imus would do, by the way.  Just brings on old Black Panthers to talk about the good old days.  And why would we support a guy who doesn't come into the morning?  Why can't they put him in the afternoon drive?  He's an older gentleman.  Let him sleep a little later.  Imus, come in at like 10.  Do middays.  Well, he'll get a massive amount of people listening at first. 
[00:31:30]  And then he'll kind of calm down.  And then he'll find his audience, which is definitely different than our audience.  Yeah, for sure.  He skews slightly older than us.  Yep.  I would say a lot older.  But I don't think that's true anymore.  We do like 18 to 49.  And he does like 25 to 106.  There you go.  But yeah, I was going to go with the serious answer.  But there you go.  25 to 106.  This is why I love Fareed, too, because Curtis and Kubi, it's kind of local, but they're  here in New York.  They're the morning show.  People see him on Fox every morning. 
[00:32:00]  And they did, I think, better in the ratings than Imus did here in New York.  But Fareed is still putting him on for the national.  I love that.  Good.  Yeah, it's very smart on his.  Did you realize I didn't know what I was talking about technically when I said the national  thing, and I threw my arms up.  People can't see driving, but I'm such a dope.  I didn't know how to say platform.  You threw your arms up.  That's all you needed to do.  Yeah.  Let's go to Sean in Jersey.  Sean, what's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, boys.  How are you guys doing?  Doing well, Sean. 
[00:32:30]  All right, cool.  Hey, listen, I just caught the last half of the discussion with you guys helping out the  police and fun down there in Philly.  Just wanted to say thanks.  You guys are always behind the firemen and the cops.  I'm a fireman in Central Jersey going to work right now, and I just wanted to say thanks,  guys.  Sure, man.  Look, man, we got a lot of cop friends.  Chill out with the supporting the firemen thing, all right?  You're going to get us in a lot of trouble here.  We're like neutral.  We like both sides.  We'll allow them to fight it out during all the parades, but when it comes down to it, 
[00:33:00]  we like the firemen and we like the cops here in New York City.  And the cops are tougher because there's all these people complaining about the cops.  The firemen, I think pretty much everybody's behind.  Like, you can't be anti-firemen.  Yeah, what are your places burning down?  You know, they should let it burn.  You see, like, you know, David Berkowitz and five other firebugs standing outside booing  the firemen.  I think even the hardest of criminals are pro-firemen because nobody wants fire to burn them.  I love the old, like, TV movies or TV shows, whatever, and you got the creepy firebug looking 
[00:33:30]  at what he did as the firemen are trying to put out the fire.  Yeah, they always show up.  They have to stand there and watch.  He's in the crowd.  And you can just look and know who it is.  Yeah.  The one staring with love in his eyes.  Then they give you a close-up of the firebug and through his, you know, the reflection  in his eyes is the building burning up.  The fire.  The creepy firebug.  All right, Sean.  No, I mean, that crap's got to, it's not going to stop, unfortunately.  But, you know, you got to take notice when a cop gets shot on the job. 
[00:34:00]  We really do know a lot of cops, and they're insane to do what they do.  I know.  I don't know how they do it.  And then, you know, they have to lose their life after being on the force.  This guy was on the force for 25 years.  And blam, a bullet right to the head, pretty much point-blank range, right?  I'd be, see, I couldn't be a cop.  I'd be shooting everybody.  I would just be shooting everyone.  You want to be like that as a regular citizen? 
[00:34:30]  I would, Dirty Harry, just pull the gun out and start shooting at the first suspicion  that there might be a problem.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't know how they walk into situations and just don't start firing.  All right, Sean.  All right, boys.  Thanks.  Bucking out.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  So, yeah, good for Fareed and ABC here in New York for hiring Imus.  December 3rd.  I completely agree, man.  Hey, do we have a, is there a dog update? 
[00:35:00]  Does anybody know what's going on with dogs about him?  Yeah.  I saw him on TV today, and I didn't see what we're doing.  That number's wrong?  Yeah.  What?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my.  I hope it wasn't someone sleeping.  Sorry, guys, but why did we get that number, then?  All right, listen, you know, we're flying by the seat of our pants, but the Charles Cassidy  Family Memorial Trust Fund, that's the cop that was shot and has since died.  If you want to donate, we gave out the wrong number.  It was close, though.  2-1-5-6-2-9-3-600. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And that definitely works?  That's been called and verified.  All right, that's been verified.  All right.  2-1-5-6-2-9-30...  Did I say 3,500?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Erase your memories.  Why is this so difficult?  Erase...  Oh, no.  Okay.  Erase your memory.  Erase your memory.  Scratch out whatever you have written down.  Because the number, here it comes.  All right, here we go.  Cassidy Fund for the cop. 
[00:36:00]  Shot and killed.  2-1-5-6-2-9-3-6-100.  That's 2-1-5-6-2-9-3-6-100.  And we'll put that number and some more info up on onaradio.com as part of the show rundown that Stephen S. from Bayshore writes.  Okay?  Right.  Sorry about that.  2-1-5-6-2-9-3-6-100.  All right.  Dog the Bounty Hunter, an update on that?  Yeah, I just saw it on TV and there was words.  Whenever they show you a picture in the top left-hand corner and a bunch of words, it's normally an apology quote. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  But I just didn't see what it was.  It's never just, hi, how you doing?  You know, this guy's just stupid.  Dog the Bounty Hunter is just stupid.  He obviously throws the word around and has no problem throwing it around and all that.  But why, if you have a hit TV show, would you leave a message like this on anyone's machine?  Well, it wasn't a message.  I don't think.  I think it was his son because you kind of almost hear his son talk at the end. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, really?  Are you kidding?  I thought he left this as a message because his son wasn't there.  We'll have to listen again.  I got it right here.  You know what?  Because he does say a private phone conversation.  Yeah.  Conversation.  Wait, his son was on the line the whole time?  He was talking to his son.  Yeah, and his son was recording it and then his son sold it to the Enquirer.  Did the son cut out his part?  No.  The stuff that's not there is not sensational stuff.  Like it just, his son is saying why, you know, that's not true. 
[00:37:30]  He just let dog go off.  He let his old man just go off and hang himself.  I think on the last track that you have, you can kind of hear his son on one track.  He must have hated his father too.  This is not just this.  He must have been just really not liking his father.  This is someone who's like in love and his father wanted them to break up and that was it.  Have you guys ever watched the show?  I couldn't get into it.  No.  It was so over the top.  I've never watched it.  Yeah.  Over the top, dramatic for no real reason. 
[00:38:00]  You know it was made to look dangerous through editing or something.  Yeah.  Fat lady.  Who's afraid of a fat lady?  Yeah.  Wanted on warrants for traffic tickets or something.  Does anyone know if his son was part of the show?  Yeah.  He was.  That was part of the issue of the whole thing was to continue being on the show.  He was to ditch the girlfriend.  Right.  And then if he wanted to keep the girlfriend, Dog was like, hey, I'll get you another job,  but you can't work here because we throw the N-word around all the time.  And I am not ever, ever going to jeopardize what I worked for for 30 years, not ever, 
[00:38:30]  to lose it all because of some bleep.  Yeah.  Well, he lost it all.  Yes, he did.  I mean, A&E is kind of like having a wait-and-see type comment.  Oh, they're conducting an internal investigation.  Yeah, but we know how that goes.  And let's play the voicemail again or whatever, the conversation,  and then we'll give you your Dog the Bounty Hunter update, okay?  Yeah.  I'm not taking a chance on some bleep out here.  She's a Mexican, a whore, whatever. 
[00:39:00]  It's not because she's black.  It's because we use the word bleep sometimes here.  I'm not going to take a chance ever in life of losing everything I've worked for for 30 years  because some bleep heard us say bleep and turned us into the Enquirer magazine.  Our career is over.  I'm not taking that chance at all, never in life, never, never.  If Lisa was dating a ****, we would all say **** you, and you know that. 
[00:39:30]  It is really frightening that a private conversation,  like your professional life can be sunk by things you say in private.  It's really, and A&E is probably going to drop the show.  They have to.  They have no choice.  But you know what?  Hey, look at the stuff Snoop has said.  Look at the stuff.  It talks about gang killings, and he's a gang member,  and what does he get, an AOL time endorsement?  So it's such phoniness.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy's a douche, but it shouldn't cost you your professional life 
[00:40:00]  considering what other guys are getting endorsement deals for doing.  Mm-hmm.  It's sickening.  If Lisa brought the black guy home, you added that.  It's not that they're black.  It's none of that.  It's that we use the word ****.  We don't mean you ****, scum, ****, without a soul.  We don't mean that ****, but America would think we mean that.  Oh, jeez.  And we're not taking a chance of losing everything we got over a racial slur  because our son goes with the girl like that.  I can't do that, Tucker.  You can't expect Gary, Bonnie, Cecily, all them young kids to because I'm in love. 
[00:40:30]  You know, all those people you just named?  They all just.  Encore racist.  Those guys, like.  They're throwing the word around like crazy.  I would love to see the tattoos those guys are sporting.  American History X tattoos.  Oh, my God.  Confederate flags.  You name it, man.  Kids, because I'm in love for seven months, I **** that.  So I'll help you get another job, but you cannot work here unless you break up with her. 
[00:41:00]  And she's out of your life.  I can't handle that ****.  He's a douche.  He is.  Dog, the bounty hunter, is a douche.  That's not as bad as I'm telling you, man.  It's just scary that that's going to cost him a gig, and it's a private conversation he had with his son.  And it's like we're judging now your public thing by what you say to somebody in private.  It's frightening.  I want to know where all the privacy, advocacy rights people are.  No one's going to get behind this.  The same ones that complain when cops get too many powers to pull you over and stop you. 
[00:41:30]  No one will get behind this guy.  And the ACLU and all these people that complain about video cameras being pointed at the street.  Where are these people complaining that a guy's going to lose his gig over something he said to his kid in private?  This guy is going to be out there by himself, man.  I know.  This is some good old-fashioned, like, Stalinism or something.  It's like the kid turning in the parent like that.  We'll give you the update.  He's destroying his life.  Here's the last part of the clip that we have.  Teresa told that girl never to come by her house again because I told her the same thing.  You're going to have your wife hanging around with that girl?  You're not. 
[00:42:00]  That was the son, by the way, in the background trying to get a word in.  How many of us have heard had these conversations?  These exact conversations?  Not the subject matter, but just the conversation where you can't even get a word in edgewise.  Let me make it perfectly clear.  We've come by her house again because I told Dwayne Lee the same thing.  Hey, I'm going to have your wife hanging around with that girl.  You're not working for Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Dwayne Lee called this morning and Teresa and said we are not hanging around with that girl. 
[00:42:30]  So just like Dwayne Lee, just like you, if you hang around with that black girl, I do not want you in my house.  Because it's already been proven that you run your mouth to her.  That's it right there.  So you just let me know.  I got to go.  What are you going to do later?  Bye.  You know, I didn't hear that yesterday when we played this.  That he said it's already been proven that you run your mouth to her.  Yeah.  Hello.  Wow.  He ran right to her and said, look what I got. 
[00:43:00]  You know what it is, too?  It's like, could he have announced who he was more?  He named everybody on the show.  Yeah, it wasn't even like he could have said, hey, it wasn't me.  Somebody like imitated me.  He just knew everything.  Now, Tucker, we all know that I am the bounty hunter.  And he just kept saying the name of the show, the time slot, the producer's name.  I swear to God, I bet the mole on my shoulder that I'm a tool.  He's a bit full of himself, huh?  Naughty boy.  So we got an update on this whole story that's breaking today? 
[00:43:30]  Yes, yes.  Television bounty hunter Dwayne Dog Chapman's son taped a private conversation in which a reality star  used racial slurs repeatedly, then sold it to a tabloid for, quote, a lot of money, Chapman's lawyer said Thursday.  Now they're positioning.  Doing a little positioning, his lawyer.  I guess because of whatever level of anger he had of his father, he felt the need to express it in that manner.  Attorney Brooke Hart told the Associated Press, shows in its fifth season in one of A&E's top-rated programs. 
[00:44:00]  It has not been canceled.  But as we said before, they've suspended production on it.  Hart said that his client is not a racist and vowed never to use the word again.  Well, how is he going to go through life without saying again?  Wow, that's a desperate man right there. 
[00:44:30]  I have never seen anything that suggests he judges people by the color of their skin or racial background or anything but on their character, he said.  Dwayne lost his composure and made a very, very inappropriate remarks for which he truly regrets.  Well.  Boy, that is some spin.  Yeah, good luck.  The way he said, it's like, at the beginning of that tape, when he goes, you know, we, let me get my beep so I could do it like that. 
[00:45:00]  He goes, now, we use the word **** around here.  He said it like, hey, you know, we drive Fords around here.  Right.  We'll be bringing a Chevy around.  But it was so as a matter of fact.  Hey, we use the word **** around here.  As you're well aware.  Yeah, you know that.  We use the word around here.  Now, you're, you know.  Use the word **** around here.  Yeah, we get it.  That right there was kind of like, it's just must always, all right, what's our suspect look like?  Well, he's a ****.  No kidding, man.  No, it's just every time. 
[00:45:30]  No kidding.  And then the story afterwards when they arrest him.  Did you see the way that **** ran?  Yeah.  And we, like, maced him in the face.  And you just know it.  All right.  Well, A&E is thinking of bringing the show back in the very near future.  They should.  Why wouldn't they?  They just have to redo the theme song.  Yeah.  This is definitely worth another play.  God, am I stupid.  I see you.  I see you loading something.  Oh, good.  They should bring the show back.  I really am a fool. 
[00:46:00]  What are you?  They should bring the show back.  Hold on.  Oh, why are you loading that in?  Larry Literal again.  You're right.  That's your character.  Larry Literal.  Jimmy's new character, Larry Literal, is going to drive us all nuts.  I didn't mean to do that.  A&E is thinking of bringing the show back in the near future with a slight adjustment.  They just got to redo the theme song.  Jimmy.  I'm such a idiot. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Oops.  At the end of the theme song, what is he saying? 
[00:47:00]  Obviously not the bleep.  He's the c*** hunter.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he is.  Oh, that's very fresh.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  Who's going to win the $1,000 today, huh?  We're going to find out soon.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Officially, the contest is on. 
[00:47:30]  When will we play the sound?  Sometime between now and 7.30.  Could it be right now?  I don't think so.  Aw.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton doing a special little thing.  Yeah.  But isn't it supposed to be a surprise?  So if you announce it, it's not a surprise anymore.  I don't get it, Jimmy.  I don't get it.  MySpace has something called secret stand-up.  Shows that they do, but then they announce you.  Yeah, thank you. 
[00:48:00]  Time out.  Secret stand-up.  But here's the big announcing of the secret.  Well, maybe...  Isn't a secret supposed to be...  Don't tell anyone a secret.  Do it in secret form, at least.  All right.  Make believe you're just telling one friend.  I have a secret.  Shh.  Next Friday night, I'll be doing the only New York show I'm doing of the year.  No way.  The only one of the year.  Hold on a minute.  You're not doing it in secret form.  That's how I would tell a secret.  No, you got to be like, shh.  All right, listen. 
[00:48:30]  Shh.  And you got to look around.  Make sure you're not listening.  Okay.  Secret.  Next Friday night.  Now that's...  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Don't tell anybody.  November 9th.  What?  Keep it between us.  Okay.  I'll be performing at Caroline's Comedy Club.  Okay.  One show only.  Shh.  It's a 7 o'clock show on Friday night, November 9th.  All you have to do is bring your MySpace profile.  It's a free show.  It's free.  Free?  Meet Jimmy in the bathroom. 
[00:49:00]  Touch his foot with a wide stance.  Meet him in the bathroom for free tickets.  I'll be between stalls two and three.  Just drill a hole in between them and slip your MySpace profile.  Friday, November 9th.  Caroline's the only show I'm doing in New York for the year.  You're just idiotic.  Can you announce a secret show, please, on the OPD show today?  Like, it's so secret.  You know what it is?  I'm not famous enough.  Like, if you're Dane, they can kind of leak it through your profile.  Right, right. 
[00:49:30]  And 50,000 people will show up.  Yeah.  And they'll find it.  But I'm so languishing in mediocrity.  They go, all right, look, it's a big secret.  Give it a week of plugs, please.  It's a free show.  Plug it for a week.  Get people down there.  There you go.  So, first come, first serve for a free show.  And speaking of Jim Norton, let's say hi to Scott in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, I'm Mark.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, I checked out Jimmy's Monster Rain last night.  Oh, no.  The HBO special?  Yeah, I rented it on DVD.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  Loved it.  Thank you.  There you go.  It was good.  But I did find that to know Jim Norton is to love Jim Norton.  My wife doesn't listen to the show, and she was a little disturbed.  Oh, really?  I mean, that's kind of good, I guess.  Yeah.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  You loved it.  Your wife hated it.  Yeah, it's all right.  Straighten her out.  Okay.  Hey, a lot of things going on in the news today.  I found this very interesting.  We like to discuss God every once in a while on this show. 
[00:50:30]  The Lord.  And then a story pops up where I just think to myself,  there cannot possibly be a God.  There is no God.  I'm a man like you.  My name's Fred.  I'm just a man like you.  I love that guy from Caddyshack.  You're a man of God.  There is no God.  God.  Can we get those clips?  We imitate that guy all the time, but I want to hear the action.  Oh, we have that clip?  Do we?  No. 
[00:51:00]  There is no God.  There is no God.  There is no God.  God.  My name is Fred.  The man.  The man.  A little.  That's a doozy, Judge.  A little Opie and Anthony trivia.  I'd never heard of this before on the fine radio show,  but I was almost Frederick Wilfred Hughes III.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And then my mom stepped in and said, F that. 
[00:51:30]  Greg is fine.  Greg is fine.  Or I could have been Fred.  I'm Fred.  I'm Fred.  I'm a man like you.  Fred's an old school.  That's a man's name.  You don't really hear of Fred's anymore.  No.  No one names their kid Fred unless it's in honor of a parent or a grandparent.  Right.  Well, my good friend Stork is named Fred.  Yeah, but you call him Stork.  Uh, yeah.  True.  Works for Newsday.  He's a great guy.  Getting married soon. 
[00:52:00]  Ooh.  You know what's a name a lot of kids don't have?  The name Guy.  No one names their kid Guts has gone by the wayside.  Guy.  Just, why did one, what nerve.  That's a set.  Oh, what do you want to name him?  Guy.  Right.  So that's what he is.  By the way, uh, there's a little humor involved here.  We don't feel like discussing if there's an actual God.  It just, it's, it's just a nice bit we like to do from time to time.  So relax out there, please.  Jackass.  But there are stories that pop up and you really question if there is a God. 
[00:52:30]  And, uh, today's, uh, story is simple.  Man who dropped, uh, atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Tibbetts.  Right.  Good old Tibbetts.  Colonel Tibbetts.  He, uh, died at the ripe old age of 92.  92 years, uh, young.  This guy was responsible, I don't know if I got my number right, but close to 200,000 people.  Yeah, probably, all told, it was like 80,000 in the blast.  He's in the.  And then about 200,000 over time from radiation and, and what not.  He's in the Guinness Book of World Records. 
[00:53:00]  Well, maybe not.  I was going to say, uh, guy with the most kills, but maybe there's another guy that, uh, kind of beat  him, but, uh, he's up there.  That is amazing to think, you know, I'm pretty much responsible for 280,000 people being killed.  There was a guy walking around for, when did we drop the bomb?  Uh, 60 years ago?  I want to say.  60 and 45.  40, 40, yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just had.  45, sorry.  Uh, yeah, August.  I know we had the 60th anniversary, uh, recently, well, within the last couple of years. 
[00:53:30]  So, 62 years.  So, the guy was.  Think.  The guy was, the guy was 30, 30 years old when, uh, he dropped the bomb, right, Tibbetts?  Yeah.  And then he walked around this earth for another 62 years, just whistling a happy tune.  Fine and dandy.  Probably getting, uh, broads and, and going out and playing a round of golf with his buddies  year after year after year.  And this guy was responsible for 200,000 deaths.  It would take a few.  He stayed in the military for about another 20 years until, like, 1966, and then, uh, 
[00:54:00]  retired.  Gave a lot of interviews.  Yeah.  Which he, uh, didn't hold back anything, really.  He didn't have one regret about dropping the bomb, uh, using some colorful, what would now  be considered politically incorrect language, uh, about ending the war.  You know, he realizes that, uh, if, if the war had continued, uh, it would have been a lot  of American casualties, if we would have had to invade, uh, uh, the actual island of, uh,  Japan, you know, Tokyo and, and get into Tokyo. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It would have just, uh, would have cost a lot of lives on both sides.  So he realized he ended the war.  You know, he was pretty instrumental there in ending the war by doing what he did.  So that's how he slept at night.  Yeah.  So a lot of people think that because that happened, yeah, well, it saved a lot of lives  in the end.  Yeah.  You think this guy, I, I like to think weird crap.  You think this guy ever walked into a sushi joint?  No.  After, after the dropping of the bomb?  I don't think so. 
[00:55:00]  This, uh, there are some old school World War II soldiers that just have no forgiveness  or, or anything in their, uh, in their hearts or minds.  Sure.  I don't know if it was this guy.  I don't know if he's the same one that did, that did, uh, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but there  was a guy in the fifties, I want to say, where they brought over girls for reconstructive  surgery, uh, who were injured in the bombing and the pilot of one of the guys came out  and spoke with somebody.  Like, no, they, they, those guys, the pilots, I think were just, uh, there was some kind  of a reconciliation or whatever. 
[00:55:30]  Um, I must've been with the Nagasaki guy.  Don't remember his name.  I'm not sure.  The plane was boxcars though.  Boxcar.  Did the guy at least, uh, suffer in death and is dying?  Probably not.  Probably just breathed like.  Peacefully slid away.  Just slid away slowly.  With the birds chirping outside his window.  No burn marks.  No, his image wasn't burnt on the cement wall next to him.  His family around.  Everything was just perfect in death.  I betcha with this guy.  Just perfect. 
[00:56:00]  So keep, keep believing in your gods.  But he said.  You would think God would throw everyone a bone and go, look, this guy really doesn't  deserve to live.  Just goes to show you, God was on our side.  That's what, that's what it was.  There you go.  I like the spin there.  God gave us the atomic bomb.  There he is.  Paul Tibbetts.  He said, uh, he said, you know, Hey, I didn't, I didn't bomb Pearl Harbor.  He goes, I didn't start the war.  He goes, but I'm damn well going to end it.  That was his quote.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  It's great.  Good old codger.  Right.  Old curmudgeon with his A-bomb.  Like a third, 30 years old or something at the time.  30.  Yeah.  Like 30 right on his nose, man.  That's a hell of a 30 celebration.  What have you, what have you done at 30?  Think, think, I think out there if you're 30 years old, what have you accomplished?  This guy was flying a huge bomber during the biggest war in the history of the world.  Uh, just ending it for, for a few, uh, hundred thousand. 
[00:57:00]  He's probably up there singing happy birthday to me, blowing out candles just before he  dropped the bomb.  You know what I did for my 30th?  I went to Disney in Florida with my brother.  This guy's dropping A-bombs from the Enola Gay.  That's what I did for my 30th, which was what?  Uh, two years ago.  Yeah.  So Enola Gay, his mom's name.  It was.  Was it really?  It was what, the plane's name was Enola Gay, named after his mom.  Great name for a plane.  Enola Gay. 
[00:57:30]  That was before, you know, the word gay was what it means now, which I'm sure in hindsight  he probably was very angry.  Yeah.  What was that 80s song that had Enola Gay in it?  I forgot.  That's a nice little trivia question today.  Um, ah, whatever.  We'll, we'll play it and we'll play some silly sound effects over or something.  There's a thing on HBO On Demand about the survivors of the, uh, I think we talked  about it once about the survivors of both the bombings.  There were people that were actually fairly close to the blast radius that lived.  Still alive.  Still alive.  I mean, they're messed up.  Two-way bombs and they're still alive. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, but there's this, it wasn't as good a special as I hoped for.  It wasn't as moving as I thought.  I mean, I don't think it was shot as well as it could have been.  No, it just wasn't moving.  But it was still, no.  Yeah.  It was still very good if you have HBO On Demand.  Hey, also in the news today, well, stuff that we're finding interesting, but then I don't  think it's that interesting.  There's a thing that came out, the 10 manliest video games ever, and I looked over the list  and realized I didn't play many of those games.  Yeah, you were saying it's like a lot of old school games.  Do we have that list in front of me here? 
[00:58:30]  Like, the only one I recognized was Counter-Strike, which is the, uh, the Half-Life thing.  That's pretty good.  Uh, but the top...  Now it's all about TF2.  The top 10 manliest video games ever.  Ever.  And they don't even have a, they only have one game, only a couple games, uh, after  the year 1999.  You go with, uh, number 10 is Pro Wrestling from Nintendo?  I don't remember that game.  When did that come out?  1986?  Yeah, that was, um, like a wrestling game, but they couldn't get any actual licenses for 
[00:59:00]  real wrestlers, so everything was just a cheap knockoff of...  Generic kind of...  Yeah, like, uh, Starman was my favorite character.  Oh, no!  Oh, you played this game.  Oh, uh, religiously.  You played it too, Iraq?  Yeah.  Of course you did.  God, I don't remember this game.  And they have, like, screen caps of these games, and they're so lame, the graphics.  And I remember, like, back in the day when you just started playing video games, you  thought to yourself, wow, it could never get better than this.  This looks amazing.  It's so lifelike. 
[00:59:30]  Fast forward a decade or two, and these games look ridiculous.  Like a flesh-colored square with a head and two legs.  Yeah, you really played this too, Iraq?  Yeah, they were all block characters.  That's a little racist.  Block.  Oh.  So that was the 10th Manly's video game ever.  Speaking French.  And then you got Counter-Strike was in ninth place there, which is a great game, obviously.  Online version of Half-Life, basically, right?  Yeah, it's a little different.  But, yeah, you just go against young little smack-tards with their headsets on laughing 
[01:00:00]  at you when they kill you in their high-pitched 10-year-old voice.  I want to start a new bit where we play, like, Counter-Strike online or whatever and just  mess with the little dweebs.  That's probably a good idea.  We should do that.  Get some audio and play it on the show.  Let's hook up the headset.  Sure.  Then you got Double Dragon from Nintendo, Arcade, and Sega, 1987.  Don't know that game either.  Oh, that's classic.  Two brothers go fight some bad guys, you know, some thugs to get their girlfriend back or 
[01:00:30]  something like that.  E-Rock, you know that one, too?  Yeah, I waste a lot of money on the arcade version and the Nintendo version.  Oh.  I thought you were changing subjects on this.  It's not always about food.  Ooh, E-Rock.  Oh, no, you did.  Wow.  Correcting it.  Strikes back.  I like it.  In a harsh fashion.  Like Double Dragon.  Yeah, that was one of those games where...  Sorry, Jim.  It's okay.  Bullshit.  Sorry, I had to defend.  By the way, and the answer is OMD, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark. 
[01:01:00]  Yes, they did a song called Enoligay.  Very good.  Lewis from Butler.  Butler.  Butler.  Butler, New Jersey.  All right, and then in seventh place, like top ten manliest video games ever.  This list really is lame.  I don't even know why.  Yeah, Street Fighter II from 1991.  Street Fighter II was pretty good.  Yeah.  Sixth place was Ikaruga.  Yes.  Something like that.  What was that about?  They're just trying to be cool.  That's a really hard Dreamcast shooter. 
[01:01:30]  You're one of those things where a spaceship is going and you just shoot things coming off.  They are trying to be too cool for the room here.  This is like, picture Rolling Stone, some guy from Rolling Stone putting out the best albums ever  and picking old school obscure stuff.  Right, because they just want to be cool.  That's what he's doing, man.  Look what I remember.  I used to like these top ten lists, but yeah, something happened where you get the people  that are putting these together.  They have to have their little cool spin.  Yeah.  I'm going to be outrageous.  I'm going to put an Iggy Pop album on the top ten albums of all time. 
[01:02:00]  Well, like, where's Grand Theft Auto?  I mean, that's a...  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  Come on.  That's not on there.  You want to talk about manly games, that's right up there.  Yeah, of course.  What is the...  I mean, smashing hookers over the head with baseball bats and stuff, that's pretty manly.  Maybe that's the best...  In the video game world.  No manly.  Best comedy games, maybe.  If you release a list like that, or games most likely to induce a rod.  Yeah.  Let's run through this list.  I don't think people care, but Tecmo Bowl, what's that?  That's just a class, like one of the first football games ever. 
[01:02:30]  And then John Madden.  That must have been great.  John Madden saw that and said, I think we can do a little better than this.  That's from, see, 1988.  All these games are really old.  Metal Slug is in fourth place.  Don't know too much about that.  Then you got Custer's Revenge in third place.  Oh, apparently.  Look at the screen cap of Custer's Revenge.  Oh my God, look at the graphics are horrible.  It's 1982.  There's four colors in that, maybe.  It looks like Dig Dunk.  Remember that one?  Remember Dig Dunk?  I never played it, but in the description apparently it says it's the only game where 
[01:03:00]  you can actually assault a woman.  What?  Actually take her forcefully.  Wait, Danny's got some.  Danny.  That's the entire purpose of the game.  It's not like that's just one area of the game.  That's the whole game.  It's like Atari during the...  Whole selling point.  Yeah, during the early 80s they came out, there was a few like X-rated video games and  that was like, that was one of them.  It was Custer's Revenge.  All right.  All you did was sexually assault Native Americans.  Wait, you sexually assault this thing that's on the screen cap? 
[01:03:30]  That's supposed to be a woman?  Those are her legs.  Three pixels that are supposed to be a woman?  All right, listen.  It says had Custer's Revenge come out in the robot-heavy early 1990s, it probably would  have been called Rape Simulator 2000.  They got away with this?  Yeah, surprisingly.  Actually, the only game in the history of the interactive...  Now this list is, you know, interesting.  In the history of the interactive entertainment, to my knowledge, where the goal is to rape  a helpless woman?  That's Custer's Revenge? 
[01:04:00]  While we don't condone rape here at Arthur's Hall, arthurshall.com is the ones that put  out this list, it suddenly becomes pretty damn harmless, not to mention hilarious, once  you put in the context of an Atari 2600 video game that was released over 20 years ago.  Wow.  And that's not the only one that was sexually explicit.  There was a few other ones, too.  The Angry Video Game Nerd tackles some of these games if you want the audio.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, we haven't done Angry Video Game Nerd in a while. 
[01:04:30]  No one's coming out, though.  David Copperfield's Revenge, which is very much like Custer's.  It just takes place on Rape Island.  Rape Island.  That's the subtitle.  But listen to this.  The gameplay is simple.  You're a naked and horny General Custer with a big, fat, four-bit...  Four-bit.  Four-bit.  Yeah, they call it a four-bit...  On the far right of the screen is a naked Indian maiden tied to a steak.  But she doesn't look tied.  I know, the graphics... 
[01:05:00]  It looks like a Chinese letter.  Him standing at her legs.  It's terrible.  You know what's funny?  We don't even have a problem with the concept.  We have a problem with the awful graphics.  The graphics aren't graphic enough.  The rape isn't real enough.  Good concept, poor execution.  The goal is to have sex with her as much as possible without getting hit by the arrows  falling from the sky.  Wow.  The action button is the rape button and can be pressed once you work your way over to  the maiden to ravage her.  If you rape her for too long, you will no doubt be hit by the falling arrows. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  It's best to move away and wait for an opening to rape her some more.  Jeez.  This is insane.  Is this the actual instruction booklet?  Yes.  How did this get past everybody back in the day?  Now if you have a little blood in your video game, there's an outrage in there.  You're protesting.  No one was really looking at these things back then except the few geeks that were playing it.  Right.  I think the market for X-rated Atari games was five dudes, so it kind of went under the radar. 
[01:06:00]  You're awarded points for every thrust, of course.  And then it says, yes, this is sick and depraved, and whoever programmed this game should probably  be sent to prison.  Still, who else would have had the balls to make a game like this?  The whole concept is just insane.  Custer's Revenge just might be the most politically incorrect thing I've ever witnessed.  And that makes it manly as hell.  We're going to try to get some audio from this game after the break.  Okay.  Custer's Revenge.  And I was thinking the list didn't have Grand Theft Auto on it because maybe the list was 
[01:06:30]  being politically correct, but that threw that right out the window.  Oh, no kidding, huh?  And then you got, in second place, Manliest Video Games Ever, according to ArthursHall.com,  Mike Tyson's Punch-Out from 1987.  I remember that one.  It's a classic.  Yeah, that's a classic, obviously.  That could have been the same as the other game, actually.  Tyson's Revenge.  And Custer's could have been the same.  And the fact that the Tyson in it was 6'8", and the little white guy, he looked like Waldo  without the glasses.  He was probably two inches tall.  He was supposed to kick his ass?  How is that a fun game? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, I don't think so.  It was great.  Your goal is to get me Custer's Revenge Audio ASAP.  Danny's working out feverishly.  All right, good.  And then the number one Manliest Video Game Ever, Contra from 1988.  No clue.  Oh, it's classic.  A lot of people my age know the 30 life code by heart.  I'm sure Eric does.  What?  Like, there's a code you put in the start menu to get 30 lives, and everybody between  the ages of probably 20 to 30 right now.  You just instantly put it in. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Just, like, starting the game up.  Because you couldn't.  It was impossible.  It was almost impossible to even...  What was the game?  I don't get it.  It kind of looks Mario Brother-ish.  No, it's a shooting game.  It's a screen cap.  It's like, it's one of the first games where you could play with a buddy, too, and the  two of you run around and shoot things.  Aliens.  Shooting very primitive graphics.  Yeah.  Of things.  You and your friends sitting there with your boy legs touching.  Just sitting there with your short shorts.  A couple of teenagers with your boy legs just bumping each other accidentally. 
[01:08:00]  A little newborn foal kneecaps.  Sometimes they'd overlap.  A little smooth.  Hey, Anthony, do you have that sound clip from Contra?  Yeah.  From the game Contra.  Oh, we do.  This is actual shooting audio from the game Contra.  I actually have it.  Wait a minute.  I thought we were just looking for the stuff.  Larry literal wants to know.  Why would you say it in a way that implies that there's going to be something else?  I happen to have it.  Yeah, he does.  Okay.  This is actual audio from Contra.  Okay.  You're the best around. 
[01:08:30]  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  From the manliest video game ever, according to arthurshall.com.  Manly.  We do believe that's audio from the game Contra.  Yes, gentlemen.  I'll be playing Pose Revenge.  It's set on a video game of F.H.  Riley's.  No, not.  No.  In the parking lot.  Oh, yes.  I want to make it very clear.  You have to walk through the establishment first. 
[01:09:00]  We don't condone that activity at that fine restaurant.  Then you go out back.  Pose Revenge is he ties you to a stake and then talks to you.  And the women just start begging for Custer, Tyson, Tibbetts and his plane, anything.  But then the victim gets you back by emailing a thousand people for the next five years.  Oh, that was a little too inside.  Yeah, of course it is.  Hey, it's F.U. Friday.  Let's go to the F.U. line. 
[01:09:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, ONA, this is Matt from Chicago.  I just want to send out a big F.U. to everybody who's taking you off the radio in Chicago.  F.U.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. to the F.U. and her disgusting, shy little husband that I just had to kick the door into the hotel room and her rest.  Stop wasting my time, you f***er. 
[01:10:00]  Next message.  Hey, this is going after Britney Spears who's turned into the biggest F.U. of the universe.  F*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to the F.U. to cut me off today and I had to track down and kick his F.U. ass.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hey, you stupid little rich F.U.  You think I brought you your pizza so I can get a 30 cent tip?  You stupid bastard living in your big house, staring there, smiling at me.  F*** you.  Next time I'm going to take a big F.U. on your pizza.  Next message. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, this is Jamie.  I want to give a big F*** you to 103.1 The Buzz in West Palm Beach.  More rock?  Well, let's talk, right boys?  That's what's going to hold your number two rating spot.  I hope your ratings crash and your studio gets blown up by a drunk fuel truck driver with everyone that works for that stupid station inside.  F*** the Buzz.  Next message.  I'd like to say a big F.U. to Ronnie, my soon-to-be ex-wife for 12 f***ing years for waking up after 12 years and telling me I don't love you anymore.  Hey, F.U.  I'm such happier now with my 22-year-old f***ing girlfriend who's f***ing rules. 
[01:11:00]  I love you, Tammy.  Next message.  H-W-I-S-T.  F*** you.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Gotta tell you, another busy show today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's quickly congratulate Peter.  He won $1,000. 
[01:11:30]  Peter, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you just won $1,000 just for listening to the show.  Congratulations.  Hell yeah, dude.  I'm a loyal fan, too.  I'm not a contest pick.  Oh, I like that.  But, you know, I was listening to you guys since you were on other stations, like WNEW back in the day.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  That goes back a while.  I was at your softball game, too, with a couple of buddies of mine.  Yeah, I think we're going to try to bring back the celebrity softball game this coming summer.  Yeah, that was a couple years ago. 
[01:12:00]  It's not about the softball, by the way, for the new listeners.  We actually make believe it's a huge, like, softball game, my team versus Anthony's team,  and we get celebrities on both sides.  And then you realize after the first out, no one gives a crap about the game.  No one cares.  It's all about flashing in the stands and drinking as much beer as humanly possible.  And there's no celebrities.  That's the beauty of it.  Yeah, and there's no celebrities.  People show up and go, oh, my God, wait a minute.  These guys are considered celebrities?  Our idea of a celebrity would be out in left field.  It's Pat Duffy. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  Yeah.  When you fill up your roster with interns, you realize you have no friends in this business.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Right.  You call a lot of the guys that have done the show, and they're like, oh, I would love  to, but I, well, I'm touring Japan.  Yeah, very busy.  I forgot my sneakers that day, so I had to wear my stupid Doc Martens and my shorts, and I  played on awful Opie's team, and he sat me on the bench to start the game.  Then I really...  Opie just loads his team with ringers, and I have all the drunks, and that's what you think. 
[01:13:00]  Because you don't care.  I don't like to lose.  You had equal opportunity to pick guys, and you just don't...  I don't know ringers in softball.  You take your brother...  You get your brother's friends and stuff, and relatives, and they're ringers.  Well, yeah, I mean...  They've never made an appearance on the program, and they're friggin' on your team.  Well, yeah, my brother-in-law, Mike, had hit a few homers.  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  And brother Elmo is pretty ridiculous himself.  He played a game recently, and he was hitting them into the woods, and it was like, what 
[01:13:30]  the hell?  But you had La Machine.  La Machine stunk.  Yeah, it's great.  If someone's coming to assassinate you, but you need someone to pull a pistol, or you need  an uncomfortable fat man to stare at you, La Machine is perfect.  Something interesting came out today on this show, and we were just saying congrats to  Peter.  He won the $1,000, but I think Jimmy's still hurt that I sat him, and I didn't even realize  I sat him until right now.  I actually forgot until just now.  Why wouldn't you be, though?  It's like being picked last for anything. 
[01:14:00]  Of course.  That's why I'm a comedian.  The whole reason I was there is because I was sat and picked last my whole life, and  then what happens is I thought I arrived, and I'm picked last and sat again.  Did you feel hurt?  Oh, I almost cried.  I was so angry.  I just wanted to go home, but I had...  Is it true that Tracy Morgan played in a jockstrap before you did in your Doc Martens?  Yes.  Well, Tracy was at least famous.  I understood that.  But by then, I was on the show all the time, and I still sat there.  You know, we...  You got sat?  Every day, they update that onaradio.com.  If they could find a clip of Tracy Morgan walking out in front of 6,000 lunatics in just 
[01:14:30]  a jockstrap.  Yeah, that was a huge moment.  Can we find that video or at least some pictures of that?  That was an amazing, amazing thing that happened.  I'm sorry.  I was distracted.  Yeah, but let's get rid of Peter.  Peter, thank you, brother.  All right.  Sorry for bringing up bad memories there, Jim.  That's all right, Peter.  It had to happen.  I appreciate it.  A-Rock is the best, ma'am.  All right.  Yeah.  Today's winner from Jersey.  Peter, congratulations.  You got the $1,000. 
[01:15:00]  There you go.  What's the sound for Monday, Anthony?  Let's get that out.  Here is the sound you're listening for on Monday between 7 and 7.30 a.m. to win $1,000.  Here's the sound.  Damn.  You just been pwned.  Yes.  Okay.  That's for Povember, the month of Povember, as we are calling it.  On Monday between 7 and 7.30, you're going to hear that, and that's your cue to call to win the $1,000.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  I was just watching Dance Friday there on CW11, and there were two guys on there, and one guy was shaking his ass. 
[01:15:30]  Where was Jill Nicolini?  She was there, but then they felt like people needed to see me shaking their asses, because that's hotter than seeing Jill.  Jesus.  Are they crazy over there?  All right.  Hey, Patrice O'Neal in the studio.  Why was Norton so upset about sitting?  That's what I'm thinking about.  He wanted to play.  You want to play when you're on the show.  You want to go out and play.  What were you going to do?  Go in the outfield and spin around three times? 
[01:16:00]  I don't understand.  Yeah, you didn't give any indication you wanted to play, because you showed up with Doc Martens.  I've got to defend myself here.  There was no indication he wanted to play by his body.  I was the Joe Torrey of my team there.  You know, if all of a sudden Derek Jeter shows up in Doc Martens, he's sitting.  I'm sorry.  You weren't the Torrey.  You were the Opie Himmler.  Yes.  Yes, it wasn't about fun with Opie.  It was about loading the team up with ringers, sitting the people that are on the show, and winning the game.  And just yelling at everybody.  He should have.  He absolutely should have. 
[01:16:30]  Thank you, Patrice.  I would have started one of those Derek Jeter full-size posters.  Just a poster.  Over you.  Just him.  A pitcher there.  Intimidate the pitcher.  You don't understand.  I was a good ball player when I was younger.  I was big.  What ball, though?  Jacks.  No, I was playing.  Marbles.  Don't say anything when you move.  I resent your implication that I was a slug.  I was a good baseball player when I was young.  Yeah.  Yes.  But you spun around in the outfield three times, and the coach called you a ballerina. 
[01:17:00]  That was when I played for Young's glass service.  When I was in fifth grade or fourth grade, I was the right fielder, which is always a position of honor.  Position of honor.  Jimmy hits the ball, and he slivers wetly and slowly like a slug to first base.  Oh, but the pitcher has thrown salt on him, and he's dissolving.  He disappears.  There was a...  He stops the sizzle.  I had a nervous tick where I would spin to the right once.  This is the complete truth. 
[01:17:30]  I was doing it in the outfield.  I was spinning right to the once, and I'll never forget.  My father was there, and the coach screamed from the bench, hey, Jimmy, what are you, a  ballerina?  In front of the other team and the stand.  Embarrassing.  No, no, no.  You know, now that I think about this, there was a drastic difference between the two teams.  Oh, hell yeah.  Anthony's team, after the fourth inning, was pretty much too drunk to get out on the field.  Yep.  And I'm making my guys do calisthenics in between innings. 
[01:18:00]  We actually had to have, and this isn't a lie, this is the God's honest truth, we had  to have someone from my team go over to your dugout to steal your beer, because we were  drinking all...  We drank all ours, and you guys weren't really drinking that much.  Well, my team wasn't allowed to drink the beer.  So we had to go over there and actually make a beer run into his dugout.  I hope people realize this is more of a bit than anything.  They drank whatever they wanted, but I did take it a little more seriously than Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  They certainly did.  Hey, we were just talking about...  You know who you were?  You were the other coach from Bad News Bears.  Yes.  Oh, to stay right.  Vic Morrow.  It's Vic Morrow, right.  Slapping the courtship of Eddie's father kid in the face.  Yeah.  Jimmy missed a play, and I just marched out onto the field and grabbed the ball from him  and slapped him.  Slapped him.  But, Ope, I've been coming in studio a lot.  And he slapped me on the face, and I just laid there in just a little withered hunk.  And then a tranny runs out of the field and looks me in the face and goes,  I hope you're proud of yourself. 
[01:19:00]  Wait.  Although, no.  I didn't talk about that back then.  Yeah, Ope was treating it like...  I didn't even get that.  For a second, a tranny goes, how dare you not start treating me.  Well, there was a little takeoff on the scene that we were kind of play acting.  Wasn't it the mother that said something to Vic Morrow?  But in my...  Oh, I even seen so bad who was bad.  Oh, this is on one of those deep...  This is deep white.  Well, you can go Karate Kid and think Ope was like the sensei at the bad dojo. 
[01:19:30]  Martin Cole.  Okay, I can go with that.  You were sensei at bad dojo.  Cobra Kai.  Cobra Kai.  Cobra Kai.  That's how Ope ran his team, like Cobra Kai.  Yeah, Johnny, yeah!  And I said, get him a body bag!  But Ope, I can beat this guy.  And he said, what did he say?  Sweep the leg with your Doc Martin tooth.  And then we needed a couple runs and I didn't even realize that I was sneaking my brother into the lineup  like he was batting every fourth batting. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, it was ridiculous.  And then your pitching just stunk.  Mine?  Yeah.  Like, the catcher would throw the ball back to Ope, and Ope would immediately throw the ball back.  Like, the bat...  And I was trying to tell my guys, step out of the box.  Make him wait.  Like, and my batters would just sit there and just...  One, two, three.  It's like, ah, come on.  I go, step out.  Step out of the box.  You don't have a hitting strategy with softballs.  You do!  You don't swing at every friggin' pitch he's throwing at you every second. 
[01:20:30]  Now, was it one toss or was it three winds?  He's...  Nah, nah.  I was just throwing it inside.  I strategically was throwing it inside.  He was throwing it inside, but it was the speed between pitches.  I was handcuffing the...  He just kept, like...  He'd pitch it.  The catcher would throw it back to him, and he'd instantly throw it back at you.  All right.  It's like, step out of the box.  You know what?  I know we're heading toward winter, but game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Celebrity softball in the spring.  I still don't know anybody.  Game on.  I'm done.  Have it this winter.  It's the end of the war. 
[01:21:00]  Winter?  What do we got?  A friggin' enclosed stadium?  No, this is 80 degrees.  It's going to be 80 degrees at Christmas.  Oh, that's a good point.  Thank God.  Hey, if we can find an indoor place to play, we'll play, like, immediately.  Audio of Anthony's team as I'm pitching.  Oh, no.  See, that was backwards.  That would mean I was winning.  Anthony was pitching.  Yeah, I was hoping for the, you know, one, two, three strikes.  You're out.  Yeah.  We'll do it over again.  Never mind.  That doesn't work.  All right.  Hey, we were talking about this game, Custer's Revenge.  Did you hear us talking about it?  I was listening to that.  Wow. 
[01:21:30]  Do you remember this game?  Not at all.  Not at all.  You go way back with your gaming, right?  Yeah, I do.  I go back to where Asteroids was just a triangle, and it was just, I'm a video game guy, but  I've never heard of a rate game.  Would you play at the arcade, Asteroids?  Oh, yeah.  No, that was big, big game.  I played at a Tommy Tucker's Lounge on 25A, the old Howard Johnson's.  Wow.  That's now the post office for Centerport, Long Island.  Oh, I know I'm going very local here, but they would have those tabletop games, so you 
[01:22:00]  would have your, like, gin and tonic, whatever the hell we were drinking back then.  Played Ms. Pac-Man.  Aconoid.  Remember that, though?  It was so cool, because it was a glass table, and you could play the games while you're drinking  right there on a flat surface.  Millipede.  Missile Command.  Centipede was a good one, too.  Millipede and Centipede.  Millipede was all shooting Centipede.  Joust.  Joust.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Tempest.  What was the one that it was so, we bring this up all the time.  Avoid spikes.  We bring this up all the time, but it was a shootout game. 
[01:22:30]  It was, like, two, like, gunslingers in the Old West, and there was two cactuses that  you were able to hide behind.  Right.  On separate sides of the screen, so your guy's behind the cactus, and then you had to be  brave enough to move up or down away from the cactus to try to take your shot.  Take a shot.  Which was so ridiculous, because the game could go on forever, because the other guy could just  choose never to leave the cactus.  Yeah, and the bullet didn't go fast enough.  Which is amazing now, because you play Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, and it's like 
[01:23:00]  real, it's like you die and you have a funeral, for real.  Like, for yourself, where you just, guns with camera, they have a camera gun that you don't  have to look out, just like probably the real army, and you just can see the dude, and from  that, you know, joust, and what's the one with the blocks fitting to each other, the  famous, you know.  Oh, Tetris.  Tetris, and from that to this, but I've never heard of an Indian Rape game, that is just 
[01:23:30]  No, no.  Never heard of it.  Unbelievable.  And we're finding more of these, but I guess Atari thought there was a market for like X-rated  video games, is what it comes down to.  And one of them was this Custer's Revenge.  I never heard of it.  And we have this guy, he's not one of our guys, but he's famous on the internet.  He's called Angry Video Nerd.  And what he does is he plays these really old games and just talks about them.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  So he actually reviewed this game, Custer's Revenge.  He did.  So we got some audio of him doing just that. 
[01:24:00]  It's Angry Video Game Nerd.  You can find this guy on YouTube, just put his name in the search, and it's hours of  fun listening to this guy.  Right, Danny?  Yeah, it's actually a pretty fun watch.  The thing about the porno games is that Atari wasn't actually marketing this.  It was back, you know, in the early days of video games, there was no like licensing  there, so anybody could just produce a game for that.  Oh, for that system or whatever.  If you were an independent company, you could just make a game and sell it.  Right.  And they couldn't do anything about it.  Okay.  So this was made by an independent company?  Independent company, right.  I guess in a way they were kind of happy to have it out there because it's like, they 
[01:24:30]  didn't make enough games.  So it's like, eh, screw it.  Let people make games?  I don't think that.  Enough to be on the list of best man games?  Well, you know, these idiots that make these lists have to find some little like twist.  No one heard of Custer's Revenge until this very moment.  I've never heard of that game.  All right, let's go to the audio.  It's an angry video game nerd actually talking about the game and playing the game.  Here we go.  There's an Atari game, Custer's Revenge, where you f*** a naked chick up against a cactus. 
[01:25:00]  Nobody would believe me, but it was true.  It was a real game and it came in a nice leather case, I guess so the kids couldn't see it.  At the stores, you had to ask for it because it was either hidden behind the counter or  in the back room.  But anyway, I find the picture on the front really weird.  The girl's depicted in a realistic style where Custer is like a cartoon character and he's  way smaller than her and he's got a hairy ass.  Well, let's pop this piece of s*** in and give it a go.  I don't even need to comment.  Look at this.  Well, you're both completely naked. 
[01:25:30]  Well, maybe not completely naked.  You got a cowboy hat, a pair of boots and a scarf or an ascot.  Ascot.  So, what's happening?  I want an idiot.  This kid's hysterical, though, man.  I love his reviews.  I've seen many of his videos on YouTube.  Ascot.  So, what's happening?  There's spears dropping from the sky and you got to dodge them.  Oh, look, I got hit.  Then lightning strikes and you jump out of your boots.  So, the goal is to get over there and rape her. 
[01:26:00]  It's terrible.  I can't believe I'm playing this.  Yeah.  This is horrible.  Oh, okay, I'm watching a little bit of it.  Look at the graphics of the naked woman.  I know it's radio, but it's so lame.  And especially, can you picture, if you're going to rape somebody, can you picture something  more uncomfortable to rape them against than a cactus?  A cactus.  Well, someone's shooting arrows at you.  But you don't even know it's a cactus because the graphics suck so bad.  It looks like a green post.  Yeah.  There's no hint that it's an actual cactus except for the fact that it's green. 
[01:26:30]  It's a green lowercase l.  Right.  Right, right, right.  And you have to rape her until her tribe saves her?  No, I guess you get points for every movement you make.  Every pump?  Yeah, because then you got to avoid the arrows coming down from the sky.  If they come at you.  Oh, because they're like, oh, man.  So, the idea is that there's some dudes.  Yeah.  Because I'm thinking of how they would make it now if they remade this game.  So, it's just dudes going, oh, man, he's raping her.  It's just firing up in the air. 
[01:27:00]  Let's try our best.  Like, almost like 300 with the arrow brain down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The arrows come down on you.  And you just rape until it's over.  Until it's like, uh, wah, wah.  And then you get three rapes.  Yeah.  The graphics are so bad.  I think Dan is pointing out here that she looks like an ostrich.  She doesn't even look like her.  Wow.  All right, here's more from Angry Video Game Nerd playing Custer's Revenge.  Yeah, f***er, f***er, f***er, f***er.  That's how you score in this game.  That's funny, right?  Well, it's funny for about two minutes. 
[01:27:30]  Then it gets boring.  All you do is bang the chick, dodge the spears.  Bang the chick, dodge the spears.  You know, you got to give this guy credit.  He's under attack, and he still has the nerve to go over and screw this woman against a cactus.  I think it's a cactus.  With Atari, you really can't tell.  That's what we just said.  And in the background, the beauty.  There's, like, smoke signals coming.  You know, it's the worst smoke signals.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, look.  It's just like a white little...  But back in the day, it comes up from the horizon. 
[01:28:00]  The graphics will never get better than this.  I can't believe they figured this out.  You only know who's who by the blue cowboy hat.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  Right.  And then she has some awful headdress, but you can't tell it's a woman.  No.  And there's a little red X, which is supposed to be something.  And like Eric said, it's a little football puff of smoke coming up.  I guess it's the fire.  But back then, it wasn't about the graphics.  We didn't even say, oh, the graphics.  It was, like, just the game.  Couldn't believe you were playing.  The game was just it.  But now it's just, like... 
[01:28:30]  It's ridiculous.  All about the graphics.  Go to YouTube.  Atari crap.  Custer's revenge.  Because I'm sure ONA Radio.com is not going to be allowed to have this up there.  Why?  It's like, got to keep it safe.  Here's one more clip from Angry Video Game Nerd.  You know what bothers me?  The spears don't even come down all the way.  They, like, disappear, so it doesn't even make sense when they hit you.  But overanalyzing this game isn't even worth it.  It's nothing more than a joke.  It stirred up a lot of outrage when it came out in 1982.  Native Americans were offended. 
[01:29:00]  Women activists were offended.  Of course.  Parents were offended if their kids got a hold of this.  And I'm offended.  Because this game's a f***ing piece of s***.  He is angry.  Yeah, angry video game.  Does he ever like any games?  Everything I've reviewed, he just doesn't like.  I love these guys on the internet that find their niche.  His niche is to, like, look at these old games and play them.  Yeah.  So it's perfect.  He's not going to like any of them.  And then he just curses a lot.  Because these games are so old.  How could you possibly like them? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  That's what makes it fun.  That's his niche.  It's perfect, man.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Patrice O'Neill.  He's playing the Stress Factory in New Brunswick tonight and tomorrow night.  And you know what?  Patrice, we've got someone on the line who said you killed last night.  Rich, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say we went to see Patrice last night.  He killed.  Awesome set, dude.  Thank you.  I appreciate it, man.  Thank you, dude.  Thanks for coming last night.  Cool, man.  If you need tickets, you can dial the Stress Factory and just get them in advance.  Don't be fags. 
[01:30:00]  732-545-4242.  That's ha-ha.  But Vinny made it ha-ha because 4242 is too hard to remember.  Yes.  But ha-ha is like a laugh.  Well, ha-ha is funny.  4242 isn't funny.  Good thing he didn't name it after himself.  It would have been 732-545-zzz.  That's self-serving ass.  And then special guest Vinny Brand.  In his own club.  I can't get over that.  Vinny's only there in case there's a snowstorm and the real headliner can't make it.  Stretch the phone call.  Vinny is 55 minutes ahead of me as the emcee last night. 
[01:30:30]  And he spares no expense for anything hack.  Like a gold slide whistle.  Vinny or paper.  Or an actual guy to stand up and go, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Just to bring it up.  Hey, Vinny.  Just to bring everyone on board.  Hold on.  Just to bring everyone on board.  We're reading this commercial here in New York for the Stress Factory.  We love the place.  And Vinny's the owner.  And during the live read, he lists all the comics that are coming to his club in the near future. 
[01:31:00]  And he lists himself as coming soon to his own club.  And we can't get enough of that.  He hates.  He's there every night.  He wants to be a comic so bad, but he's just stuck in being a club owner.  Yeah.  He makes millions as a club owner, but he wants.  He goes, but geez, why don't nobody respect me in the city?  Vinny, shut up.  Like, they just don't.  And they're not.  You're a club owner.  You know what I mean?  It's just like you're never going to get somebody to actually tell you the truth about your act. 
[01:31:30]  But he's not there enough, too.  Vinny goes to the city occasionally.  You never see him.  It's like he's hanging out every night and being one of the guys.  Because he owns a million dollars.  Well, he owns.  He's a millionaire, but he has this thing where he's trying to sneak around and be a regular guy.  No one's having it.  Yeah, you can't do both, I guess, huh?  He is a funny guy, but it's just.  Yes.  It's so self-serving that he lists himself as one of the comics coming soon to his own club.  And he headlines 18 times a year.  If he didn't think that he'd get spit on for it, he would list himself as the only comic.  And other guests. 
[01:32:00]  Patrice and DiPaolo.  And a very special appearance by Vinny Brand.  Vinny Brand.  Hey, Vinny.  What are you doing?  Vinny's awful.  Oh, he really thinks he's a local hit.  Oh, he's just.  I'd like to spit in his face.  The way he, like, he'll go up and do the phone call and have all the local flavor.  Thinks he's a real popular feature.  You're not.  Oh, Vinny Brand.  Went to his house for the Super Bowl last year.  I'm never going back. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, is it awful?  You ever go to some, like, Vinny's friends are so white.  Like, they're not color white.  They're just these white people.  And I'm there.  And I'm just so disappointed.  And I said, Vinny, you know what this is like?  If I invited you over to my house and we were fighting dogs and shooting each other.  Like, you come over.  Hey, Vinny, come over to my house to eat.  And you just.  And everybody's like, what?  Playing dice.  That's how white his friends were.  Like, almost Republican convention. 
[01:33:00]  A scene out of Menace to Society.  No, a scene out of his house.  It was Wicker Man.  You felt like they're getting ready to burn me in some type of room.  Oh, right, right.  It was a weird whiteness going on.  And I was just really upset with Vinny and his choice of friends.  Were they fun people, though?  Absolutely not.  They weren't white people with problems.  They were just like, hello.  People all had sweaters that fit.  You know how white people like their clothes to fit?  And you could see the waist of the sweater. 
[01:33:30]  It didn't have enough length to blouse under.  And it was just so white, it bothered me.  I can, Vinny, I'm never coming back to your house until you get some.  Because if you.  Until you get some diversity.  Diversity.  Like, you know.  A little diversity.  You've been around the world.  You travel.  You know people.  Right.  You can't have just this whiteness.  It bothered me so bad.  I was just like, I can't ever come back.  You gotta throw in a token or two.  That's what I felt like.  It wasn't even.  You were his token to say, look, see, I'm cool. 
[01:34:00]  Token black guy.  I was really bothered by it.  My goodness, Vinny knows a Negro.  And that was for the people.  That was for the people.  Lovey, lovey, look.  And you know, they've never had any interaction with a black person.  And so that was probably very awkward because they were trying to be overly cool to you.  And it was kids there.  Who gives kids at a Super Bowl party?  Just a bunch of kids with sweaters.  Running around.  Running around.  And wives were sitting there trying to pretend to like football.  And guys were like, we're breaking off into blah, blah, blah.  You want to get into the pool? 
[01:34:30]  We're doing a football pool.  It was a football pool.  I just wanted to slap everything down.  His pretzels.  And his dumb Rocky 2 pinball machine.  Even though.  Does he have a Rocky 2 pinball machine?  Vinny is.  Oh, invite me over to that house.  Vinny is classic white in terms of.  If you're like a black kid that never went to a white house.  You know, white person doesn't.  He's.  If you don't know white people, his house is like, wow.  White people live a dream.  This house should be on top of a cloud. 
[01:35:00]  That's Vinny's life.  We really got to take a break.  Patrice O'Neill is playing Vinny's Club tonight and tomorrow.  Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Patrice O'Neill.  Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow night.  New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Not all of us.  Yeah, I know.  When you said Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill at the Stress Factory.  I'd be a hell of a lineup.  I'd be able to see a whole montage of people.  You'd get to see two great comedians and then one or two of those comedians 
[01:35:30]  pointing at Anthony and I in the audience.  Listen, we stand up and wave and get our acknowledgement.  Y'all look so funny.  It's easy.  Sit back down and have another brew.  Hey, we got lots to do here.  Just wave.  Patrice.  We were talking about Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Very interesting, man.  I don't know.  It's one of those things, you know, like the Imus thing was immediately I've learned as  I get older, I try to understand the context. 
[01:36:00]  And I think if you boil it down to what's wrong right now with us in terms of this whole  problem we're having, communicating, context has been taken away.  No one tries to figure out, all right, come on.  What did he really mean that?  Imus was trying to be funny and he messed up.  Now, Dog the Bounty Hunter is different because there's so many different angles to this,  like his privacy and the parent code and his code.  Like, this situation with Dog, it's like the chicken or the egg, man. 
[01:36:30]  It's like you got to make a choice.  Like, if my mother blew up a plane, a passenger jet, I wouldn't snitch on her.  I go, man, you can blow up a plane.  I would try to make sure no one ever found out my mother blew a plane up.  And it's real.  So the parent code is strong with me and my mother.  But, you know, with him.  That's really interesting.  What would you, you know, tell authorities about your mom?  Absolutely not.  Nothing.  I think you picked the ultimate thing there. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I tried to be as horrid as I could.  Nothing.  How about she's, you know, diddling kids or something?  No.  I would tell them for being too provocative.  But it is an interesting thing.  I would try to stop her.  I would never tell my mother.  There is an interesting thing that you brought up here.  Like, there is a family code.  It's a parent code.  It's a code.  A parent code or a brother and sister, brother to brother.  But every once in a while on the news, you see, like, family members.  You're an Obama is a famous case of a brother turning into his brother. 
[01:37:30]  So that's the question.  What would one of your family members have to do for you to actually go to the authorities  and go, man, my brother or my whatever?  Nothing for my mom's.  Very little for my sister.  I might snitch on my sister if she blew a passenger jet up.  Here's where I draw the line.  If something happened where a close relative of mine did something where if I found out  about it, I'd have a chance of going to jail, then I got a rat.  I ain't going to jail. 
[01:38:00]  Self-preservation?  I am never going to jail for anybody else.  Yeah.  Ant's got to save himself.  I got to save my own.  Very selfish.  I wouldn't take a Jesus beating for my mother.  Like, I might take a torturing, but not a Jesus beating.  Not one of those, uh, Passion of the Christ.  Yeah.  A Passion of the Christ beating.  Some of the Jesus beatings look like you can handle it.  The Passion of the Christ beating.  The old school Charlton Heston movie, Jesus beating, didn't look too bad.  You got to make it perfectly clear.  Passion of the Christ, Jesus beating.  The Mel Gibson movie beating, yeah. 
[01:38:30]  They kind of romanticized the thing.  It wasn't that bad.  It didn't look too bad.  Absolutely.  I probably wouldn't do that.  But other than that, my mother could do anything because I know when I got in trouble, my mom's  put me in the trunk of her car and sent me out of town to make sure things cooled  down.  And I just would not snitch on her, but, but dog, see, here's the thing is people, obviously  he was a mad dog at his son for dating a black woman because they like to use the N word 
[01:39:00]  around the office.  Right.  And of course, uh, the son, you know, ratted his dad out and sent the tapes to somebody  taped this conversation.  Now dog is screwed and he's going to lose his show.  But there's a value of that.  There's a value there that dog is missing.  Like he broke the, the code of accepting your kid for what he does.  He told his kid, he, he, you can't love, we are going to, you're going to, we're going  to, uh, uh, not excommunicate you from the family because you're going to marry this black 
[01:39:30]  girl or you're going to be with this black girl.  And he stopped the code right there.  And another thing, the value of being a complete racist in your own home all the time, it's  like, which, who you blame?  Do you blame dog for being this foul?  And it, and it goes down to his son because did he break the code?  And then his son broke the code?  Like it's a, it's a, it's a very touchy thing, man.  And now it's the privacy of his own home.  Now he's apologizing for things he'll say in his house. 
[01:40:00]  One question is the thing about the pride, the code with the parents.  There's one part at the end of the call where he says, you've already proven that you run  your mouth to her.  It's almost like, I'm wondering if the kid kept going to the girlfriend and saying, well,  my father and all these guys say that, like, was the kid, like he was worried the kid was  going to continually tell the girlfriend that he said this stuff and get him taught.  Context, man.  It's like, you have to get in, that's the thing, the context of the situation.  Look, man, in the privacy, the dude, at least the honest thing he was saying to his son. 
[01:40:30]  And that's the thing, see, that's the thing that's killing everybody is like, I'm talking  to my son and I talk to him.  I'm like, look, man, you know, these people, I call white people, dude, if I had a son,  you call white people, dude, now, and I'm talking to my black son and I'm going, look,  man, these crackin' blue-eyed devil scorn of the earth, man, how you going to marry  this dusty white woman?  She's a zombie.  Look it.  And then I'll show him slides of lynchings and I said, look, don't bring this white powdery 
[01:41:00]  piece of garbage into my house.  And it's still, I think I would go, I know I'm racist, but I'm not, see, I think you should  be allowed to be racist.  In your own home, especially.  Why are they trying to stop me from being, like, I don't need to like you.  He didn't say anything about, like, listen, if you marry her, I'm going to take her down  to the basement gallows that I have. 
[01:41:30]  The basement gallows.  Or the guillotine that I have.  Yeah, yeah.  Where all the other Negro heads are.  And I'm going to chop your Negro, your little neglet wife head off.  Right.  That's different.  That's, that's some other thing, but he's just in the, and he's not dog the reverend.  And he's not dog the tickler.  He is an ex-criminal who hunts down the most vicious animals with mace and his fat wife. 
[01:42:00]  He can say, he can be racial if he wants.  Notice he didn't hear gun in there.  He's not allowed to have a gun.  He can't have a gun because he's a criminal.  He's a convicted felon.  The dude has this, one of the worst ratty, uh, mullet, mullet, it's more than a mullet.  You know that guy's racist, but because he can't carry a gun, he has to use his fat wife  as a distraction.  Yeah.  His wife is just, just a mess.  A mess.  Thank you for saying it.  He sends the wife in first. 
[01:42:30]  Just, she, the people go like, oh, it's like, it's like a flashbang grenade.  Right.  He sends his wife in to stun the crowd and then the rest can rush in.  They think a talking pig has entered.  They all stare for a moment.  You know, flanks him.  And, and it's stupid to even say this because it's just not going to happen.  But A&E should continue with the show.  You aren't reading.  Wrong.  He blew it.  He's done.  He's done.  He is done.  He's so done.  I, but what, I, don't you think he should be allowed to continue?  Why not?  Just by what we were talking about.  What's wrong with corporations? 
[01:43:00]  Dude.  It ain't going to happen.  It ain't going to happen.  I understand that.  Take that out of the equation.  Do you personally feel like the show should continue?  I tell you what, no, because I don't feel bad for him because he's, I wish I didn't find out.  I.  But he's a, he's a dirty, he's a racist.  I.  And I don't feel for him.  You know what?  But I say, I say, I say he should be able to continue because that would be for, that  would be interesting TV to watch.  Yeah.  That's all.  I don't give a crap about him as a person.  It's my stupid TV.  Obi, this one is strange.  I don't give a crap about these people on TV.  This one is strange because I can, it's just, it's not a freedom of speech thing. 
[01:43:30]  It's like, it's insidious.  This is the thing that white, black people, it's almost like the Rodney King thing in  a weird way, is that black people just go, this is how they all talk.  Well, white people, white people do that too.  When we watch the news and stuff, we go, look, oh my God, why can't they just act like people  and not commit all these crimes and stuff?  See, it works both ways, but I'm not saying we're all racist and you guys are all criminals.  Yeah.  That's, it's the pretty much the, what everyone thinks. 
[01:44:00]  I'm not even talking about freedom of speech.  I'm talking about just good TV watching.  I'm like, then, wow, now this is a show I would personally check out.  And you know something, and I feel, I feel what you're saying.  They're doing that with a lot of reality shows.  They're starting to do background checks on these people.  And if they have any, anything that happened in their past, they don't want them on TV  anymore.  And those are the type of people I do want to see on reality shows.  I want to see the, these, uh, these ugly, uh, personalities on TV.  Here's a great way he could have spent this.  And if he wasn't being phony, this is another thing, dog. 
[01:44:30]  If he's listening, here's what messes everybody up.  This is what mess Michael Richards up.  Just Pee Wee Herman.  My thing is, look, I watch my girl got a kid and I, and, and this kid, Disney is as big  of a thing as I've, I've never seen anything bigger than Disney.  It's like, kids are like Disney, whatever, Raven, Simone.  And she knows every word to everything.  And I'm like, look, I couldn't take a job at Disney because I know I have the propensity  to do something wrong somewhere. 
[01:45:00]  Somehow.  I don't know how to live that life.  I'm going to do something in a movie theater.  Me and my girl are going to sneak in the bathroom and do something.  This guy knew he was a racist.  He should have spent it like this added a character that stopped him from being racist.  Like, all right, that, that Negro there, he lives there and there's a couple of spics  up the street.  A black character with him.  Somebody to go, dog, you can't say that word.  Oh, why?  Why?  I'm just calling him a name.  I'm just calling him a dirty spick. 
[01:45:30]  What is the wrong with that?  I'm going to arrest this guy.  He's going to shoot me in the face.  I can't call him a spick.  And that would have destroyed anything that they could have did to him, but he was living  a phoniness.  And it's like, he's like, don't tell people I call people.  And it's like, you go, you don't feel for him because he was being a phony.  Yeah.  He had some kind of family values thing going.  Yeah.  He blew that, man.  He's a phony.  All right.  Listen, we got to change gears a little bit because we're running out of show.  We got to do the football picks.  All right.  The Super Bowl. 
[01:46:00]  Patriots.  Yes.  The Super Bowl is being played this weekend.  Patriots.  Patriots all the way.  Oh, look at these.  Patriots.  Oh, I didn't know about that.  There may be a bit of an upsetting.  No.  Colts are at home, though.  No.  Not a chance.  Not even a chance.  I don't care what anyone says.  You can disco.  I have my method of football picks.  And we're doing that right now.  That is infallible.  Yeah.  We're doing that now.  But the Super Bowl is being played this weekend. 
[01:46:30]  Don't pay attention to that corporate event they do in late January, early February.  Well, you have to call it the big game.  The Super Bowl is this weekend with the Patriots playing the Colts.  That's the greatest game of the year.  I don't give a crap who ends up in the Super Bowl.  This is the game to watch this football season.  Bill Belichick has pictures of Peyton Manning robbing his house and tying his family up.  And he showed Teddy Bruski this.  And Teddy cried.  And then he showed Rodney Harrison the picture.  Like, can you believe Peyton Manning robbed me and tied my wife up? 
[01:47:00]  That's what he's doing right now.  An animal.  They're going to destroy them.  And you know that Brady is on track to have 60 touchdowns this year.  That's insane.  He already set his career record and we all think he's great already.  The Patriots have a problem this year.  Tony Dungy is like, you know, he's going, hey, you know, this is just us playing and this is one game.  And Bill Belichick, you don't even hear him talking because he's such a stoic idiot.  And he's just like, we're just playing. 
[01:47:30]  But he's just, he's somewhere stamping like the things that they brand horses.  He's just doing that.  I'm telling you, Patriots.  I say Patriots.  Kill them.  Even though they're away.  Football pick sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Anthony is doing my football picks today.  Here we go.  This is how he's doing.  I'm listening to this.  And you can help out, by the way.  Just bet along with me this week because it's a lock.  All right.  I am picking teams based on their names. 
[01:48:00]  Now, you might say, what?  Go ahead, say it.  What?  What?  I say you might.  I'm looking at what the names of the characters are, what they are.  And if they could, if they were put into form, could they conquer the other team's name?  So let's get an example.  I feel you right here.  Patriots.  By the way.  We have a, what?  I'm just pissed off.  I didn't, obviously the Patriots and the Colts can't play in the Super Bowl. 
[01:48:30]  I know that.  I'm just saying, this is the, this.  Did somebody question that?  Oh.  Why even point out the idiocy?  Because I just wish people would listen a little closer.  Just a little closer to the show, you idiots.  I'm just saying, this game is way, way bigger than any Super Bowl they could throw at.  You know who knows that?  Later on in the year.  800 million people out of the 802 million that are listening.  All right.  Two don't know.  All right.  Turn off the instant feedback.  Jeez.  Done.  Done for today. 
[01:49:00]  Goodbye.  Go ahead, Ian.  I'll use that big game as an example here.  You have the New England Patriots.  What have gone?  The Patriots against the Indianapolis Colts.  A horse.  Now, a horse.  You know that you've seen many Patriots riding horses.  They shoot them to eat them when they were starving.  Whatever.  They controlled this animal.  They controlled it.  But you can only shoot a bullet every 20 minutes.  Yeah, but you can shoot a horse once.  It doesn't say the New England Patriot.  Ah.  But it does.  It's also Colts. 
[01:49:30]  So there's a few Colts also.  Very clever.  But you could absolutely just slaughter Colts.  I pray your football picks.  Wait a minute.  You go undefeated this week.  This will be great.  Because you're a Patriot, that implies a state of mind and a state of living.  It doesn't mean you have a gun.  I'm also going with logos on helmets and stuff.  It's a fighting guy.  The logo is just a head.  That's a fighting guy.  The logo is a head.  He's got his oldie time.  Oh, it used to be a dude.  A bent over fruit.  I remember.  A guy that was in the center position, but he's dressed like a Patriot. 
[01:50:00]  With one of those Patriot hats on.  Triangle hats.  Yeah.  And it's Boston.  All right.  Let's move on.  Let's move on.  Because we got Patriot.  We got six more to do, so let's move on.  Patriots only Colts?  Yeah.  Now, this is the most difficult one.  And I think most controversial is the Washington Redskins against the New York Jets.  Yes.  Now, this all depends.  Here's my logic.  New York Jets.  I believe they used to play at Shea Stadium when they were first made as a team.  And that's right by LaGuardia.  Right.  So I think that's why they got the name Jets. 
[01:50:30]  Well, they used to have a jet on there as their logo.  So I'm thinking, and it's passenger jet.  Yeah.  Not like a fighter jet.  Right.  Passenger jet.  That's key.  Because I think a bunch of Indians, engines, oldie-time engines on horseback with hatchets  can completely make a plane unable to fly.  I don't think a jet could take out a bunch of engines.  Even the ones now, the Redskins now.  Yeah.  Like, they could just wreck a plane.  The ones that actually take planes. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  Passenger jet is not, doesn't have movability, really.  Like a fighter jet.  No, no.  Not a lot of mobility.  Mobility is what I meant to say.  Sorry.  And the Washington Redskins could just play a little possum.  Can I add something to this?  Exactly.  Also, the New York Jets now just suck.  Exactly.  So I'm going with the Redskins over the Jets because they suck.  No, you got to suck.  And I think Redskins can actually take their tomahawks and stuff and hack apart a jet. 
[01:51:30]  And make it novel.  And you go, oh, a jet could fly.  Well, flying a passenger jet can't hurt the Indians.  And eventually it's going to run out of gas and have to come down.  It's over, John.  And following your logic, a jet has only one move, to crash.  Yeah.  And there's going to be some Redskins that will survive that.  Exactly.  On the runway.  That is just ridiculous.  If you're driving your plane on the runway.  The Jets one is ridiculous.  It's not ridiculous.  It's not, Jimmy.  It's not because if you're on the runway driving your plane and there's a bunch of guys in a  circle going, hey, hey, hey, you run them over.  They get out of the way and wait it out. 
[01:52:00]  I'm with Jimmy.  They wait it out.  The plane runs out of gas.  They don't know.  They think it's going to make it rain and the plane will go down.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  The fact that the Redskins will go, hunger, what sting fly in air, they'll be all shocked.  But the point is you can't take them all out.  Right.  What about the guy in the teepee smoking the peace pipe?  Doesn't feel like doing a high-high-high guy.  He's stoned.  He's a drug addict.  They would think it was a giant bird.  I'm flying.  I see engines.  I see Redskins. 
[01:52:30]  We got five more to go.  Let's just go Redskins over the Jets.  Let's go.  Flying right into it.  Let's go.  All right.  Okay.  Panthers against Titans.  Yeah.  Now, a Titan is a big, like, godlike character against some Panthers.  I think I got to go with the Titan.  But that's a make-believe character.  But I know.  But that's what I say.  You bring them to life.  He's swinging Panthers by the tail and just wailing them.  All right.  It's not even affecting them.  Titans over the Panthers.  It's floral Titans.  That's what I'm doing.  Or it could be Black Panthers and they blow up with a Titan. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Still, I think the Titans get them.  The Black Panthers.  San Francisco 49ers against Atlanta Falcons.  Now, you're talking about these guys that used to pan for gold against these birds of prey.  Yeah.  But they do have guns, the 49ers.  Occasionally, they carry guns.  They did hunt birds.  I don't know if they're shooting Falcons.  No.  I'm...  What?  Yes?  Most 49ers just had colanders.  I know.  They have like a thing that's so busy and greedy with their gold.  I'm going Falcons.  They're rushing in and plucking their eyes out. 
[01:53:30]  What?  I'm going Falcons against 49ers.  Oh, no.  That...  Dude.  Oh, no.  They can pluck their eyes out.  Yeah.  All right.  They can pluck their eyes out of a guy with...  Can they?  With a pick?  He's just...  No, he's sitting there with a pick.  Yeah.  This guy's not going to hit a Falcon with a pick.  He's there panning for gold all day.  First of all...  No, I have to disagree.  You don't like this one?  A Falcon...  When you say pluck, you're talking about a scene from The Omen when the bird...  He's just going to pluck.  But a Falcon can't pluck a guy's eye out.  Talons first into his face? 
[01:54:00]  A 49er with those strong pan hands can just choke a bird.  It can flatten a Falcon's face with that colander.  All right.  You convinced me.  I'm going 49ers.  No, no.  Just take the sifter and smash that bird right in his faggoty beak.  Or hit him with the pebbles that have no gold in it.  And just take a fool's gold.  And just throw it right in his face.  I don't know.  The Falcons are very fast, very maneuverable.  All right.  What's your pick, official?  I'm sticking with my first...  Look at how very...  I'm sticking with my first instinct. 
[01:54:30]  I'm going Falcons again over the 49ers.  All right.  All right.  Falcons are at home.  Now, the Buffalo Bills against the Cincinnati Bengals.  Now, this is another controversy because a lot of people say Buffalo Bills aren't Buffaloes.  They're Buffalo Bill.  But they are Buffaloes.  But the logo is a Buffalo.  Right.  So, I'm going with the Buffaloes, but I'm not going with them.  I'm absolutely going with the Bengals.  No!  Because a Bengal tiger can beat the crap out of a Buffalo Bill.  Now, I know how the Bills have been doing. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, come on.  I like taking a peek at the Bills.  Don't do this.  Dude, I know.  But I'm going to have to go with the Bengal tiger over a Buffalo.  He gets up on the back.  He starts biting that big fat neck.  But according to how he's picking them, that's how it is, man.  It's just how it is.  It's just how you beat a Buffalo.  A Bengal tiger against a Buffalo?  He's killing them.  But a Buffalo Bill.  He would jump on his back and bite his neck and the whole thing.  That's what they do.  A Buffalo Bill is a tranny with a gun.  So, I would put a Buffalo Bill against a tiger. 
[01:55:30]  This one's easy.  Come on.  A Jaguar against a Saint?  Yeah.  I don't care if you've got God on your side.  The Jaguar's ripping your throat out.  No.  Saint is, like, godly.  And, like, I don't think they have a human form.  Yeah, they're always martyrs, Saints.  Yeah, Saint.  I'm not talking they're not Saints yet.  What?  They've got to be a Saint already?  Yeah, like, Saint Christopher was just crisp.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm talking that.  Oh, it's not like the angels.  Oh, so it's like Sir Paul. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's still Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  So, I'm just saying the Jaguar is ripping out his throat.  Oh, my God.  We already did the Patriots and Colts.  This is so ridiculous.  But it's just as good as anybody else's picks.  Exactly.  How do you pick them?  Pick this and you will win.  Texans against the Raiders.  You've got to go with the Raiders.  Pirates.  Yeah, they're pirates.  They're vicious.  I don't think their boats would work in Texas very well.  Texas would try to fight their way out of them, but the Raiders would just get them.  I think that's close, too. 
[01:56:30]  It's close.  Texas.  I don't know.  Texans.  Texans I don't see as being military Texans, though.  I just see them as Texans.  Just regular old Texans.  They're just Texans.  Stage coach.  Yeah, stage coach.  A woman washing on the washboard.  And then a bunch of pirates come in and hack them up with their sabers.  Lily and her prostitutes up on the top floor.  Yes, Jim.  Texans have guns.  All of them.  Oh, Jesus.  Everyone in Texas has a gun.  Raiders have guns, knives, poison.  And they're very, very sneaky. 
[01:57:00]  They're very sneaky.  And they also have Johnny Depp.  Yes.  And they have that flag, the Jolly Roger.  I would say Raiders.  My instinct is Raiders.  I'm going Raiders.  Hold on a minute.  Over the Texans.  All right.  Let me, Raiders over the Texans.  Write that down.  All right.  Here's my picks.  Rich from Orlando.  Thanks to Anthony, by the way.  Rich, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yep.  I want to just remind you, Ant, that this game is not being played in 1985.  The logo is an F-14 now.  That's for them trying to be cool. 
[01:57:30]  They did update their logo.  They updated it, and it's trying to be cool.  But the fact of the matter is, early on in the beginning, the inception of the name,  I don't believe they were talking about it.  I think it was just a jet.  Today.  The Dollar Sunday.  F-14 is beating a group of Redskins, by the way.  Without a doubt.  Well, yeah.  I got to say that.  An F-14 would beat a group of Redskins.  So what are you going to do?  It would wipe out an entire nation.  Are you sticking with your pick or what?  I'm still sticking with my picks because I'm picturing a big lumbering 727, 737, something 
[01:58:00]  like that, 757, and a bunch of engines just hitting it with arrows, ruining the compression.  Hitting it with arrows?  Yeah.  Oh, that skin is thin.  An arrow go right through that.  Their Rambo explosive tip arrows?  Yes.  All right, listen.  Tin foil skin, though.  We have to take a break.  We'll see how your picks do this weekend.  You watch.  I have faith.  It's a weird way to pick games, but.  No, it isn't.  We'll say the football picks.

He's playing in the Stress Factory in New Brunswick tonight and tomorrow night.  There you go.  Opie and Anthony.  When you need to know something, call Opie and Anthony.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  They will give it to you like it is.  Cell phone and PDA users send your message to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  Everything.  Went down the hall to give Tom a talking to. 
[01:59:00]  Because I guess we don't have a PD right now, so we'll go right to Tom ourselves.  That's what the PD should be doing.  Dumping out of what?  Racial slurs today?  Yeah, racial slurs that Patrice said.  The black man should be able to say whatever the hell he wants.  That's right.  That's why you got me here.  That's right.  That's why we bring him in so you get a little saucy with our language.  Old sellout letting them old say their old racial slurs. 
[01:59:30]  And that sellout's going to be at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow night.  Patrice is just amazing on the stage.  Absolutely.  You got to watch them work.  And you want to promote to what?  Patriceoneal.com?  Patriceoneal.com.  My podcast that I say everything that you guys are having trouble saying right now.  Yep.  God, I could be racist on my podcast.  You do something called what?  Patrice for president?  Yeah, I do a lot of stuff.  I do one called Pittens where I pit fight kittens.  Like Michael Vickie, but we fight kittens and then we kill the losers. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Play Pittens real quick.  I don't know.  I'll try to get it.  Someone in the office get it so we can play before we get out of here.  Now, this kitten right here, I'm telling him he won.  He won the fight.  Yeah.  But I'm going to kill him because he didn't win-win.  He didn't really win.  Yeah, he didn't really put his all into it.  He didn't put his all into the win.  Wow, dude, you know how to look like a gangster when you need to.  Oh, my God.  Look at the hoodie you got on.  Look at the little kitten.  Where did you get the little kitten? 
[02:00:30]  We got him from like, I don't even think we should stay with it, but we got him.  Oh, it's adorable.  And gave him back.  Looks like little Jack Jack.  You have to use them for your sick bit.  It's called Pittens.  It's part of your, what, video podcast?  Yeah, just right on patriceoneal.com.  But it's something that I'm really happy with and it's something that's okay, but it's  something I love.  I know her.  That's my woman.  I know.  Well, I didn't know you wanted me to say that.  Yeah, yeah.  She's part of your video podcast?  And she has to do something.  Who's doing the video work?  Look at that cleave that she's showing everybody.  For your imagination. 
[02:01:00]  And we just do it together, man.  Yeah.  Do a good job with the graphics and everything.  Thank you very much, sir.  That's very nice.  Patrice on the Alpha President is one of the people's favorite.  And there's one called Dyke Punching.  Can I say that?  Who knows?  Who knows?  But that's cool.  You went from not really having a website to it looks pretty cool, this website of yours.  Yeah, it's fun.  There's a lot of podcasts.  All right.  You know what?  We're going to take a look at that and then we'll bring you back to talk about some of  these video podcasts.  All right?  Hey, a little earlier we were talking about like porn games that were available for the 
[02:01:30]  Atari system back in the day.  Back in the, what, early to mid-80s?  Yeah.  And Angry Video Game Nerd, who we're a big fan of.  And he's a fan of ours, by the way.  He's got a WoW sticker in a lot of his YouTube videos.  It should be mentioned.  He reviewed a few more of these angry, a few more of these like porno games for the  Atari system.  Angry Video Game Nerd, more Atari porno games.  This first one is called Beat Em and Eat Em.  Let's see what this is about, according to the Angry Video Game Nerd. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  What kind of surprise do we have in here?  Beat Em and Eat Em, a girl licking an ice cream cone.  But what the f*** is the title about?  It doesn't sound pornographic.  It sounds violent, like you beat somebody up and eat em.  Oh.  I get it.  Beat Em and Eat Em.  Oh dear.  What have I gotten myself into?  All you do is move these two sluts back and forth to catch this stuff that this guy shoots  down.  Oh, yummy. 
[02:02:30]  Let's take a look at the manual.  And here it says, the object of the game is to eat em every time he beats em.  You score one point for each an a** without a miss.  But should you miss, shame on you.  You lose one turn.  After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.  While I'm watching the video, it's being played.  It's beat em and eat em.  Jeez.  This is twisted.  Girls are down below trying to catch something.  And the two girls move at the same time? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  They move exactly the same way.  You all right, Jimmy?  Did it go well?  Hey, we're fighting for every possible word for this damn radio show.  At first, Tom was like, well, this is why.  But then he's like, well, I'll listen to it.  Because I said, like, Patrice is doing a, it was a really funny racial parody.  But it wasn't like some anger thing.  Like, he's reading the paper going, do you believe the, it wasn't like that.  It was a very funny thing.  It's like, there has to be some kind of context.  Yeah.  Like you said before, context. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  It's just enraging.  Right.  That, uh.  And this is the stuff Tracy should be doing for the show, by the way.  Instead of getting, you know.  Let her do it to you.  Who cares?  You know, instead of her.  I'd rather talk to Tom anyway than just go to somebody else.  Instead of her getting insulted because we're having a little fun on the show.  It doesn't matter.  Who cares?  You know, you should be in Tom's office every day arguing and fighting for all this stuff for us.  Maybe she is.  Or maybe she just punishes us by saying, well, I'll show them.  Then show us.  Don't take, yeah, don't take what you hear on our show personally.  It's not your job as a PD to get personally insulted and hurt. 
[02:04:00]  That amazed me, by the way.  I was amazed.  All right.  Anyway, let's move on.  But it went well, Jimmy.  I mean, Tom, you know, he's working with us.  He's trying the best he can.  Tom is reasonable.  And I'm not saying that to suck up to him because he's a creepy corporate man.  But he is a reasonable guy.  And he said he'll listen to me.  He's a reasonable man.  This humongous.  We're all reasonable men.  All right, here we go.  Another game called Kaboom.  Another porno game that was available for the Atari system.  So the gameplay is basically the same sort of thing as Kaboom, except Kaboom was a great game. 
[02:04:30]  But this is just a...  Oh, okay.  This is more on Beat'em and Eat'em.  And they're comparing it to Kaboom, if you remember that game.  I don't, obviously.  Remember the name.  So the gameplay is basically the same sort of thing as Kaboom, except Kaboom was a great game.  But this is just a miserable load of...  You gotta be completely accurate to land it in their mouths.  And it uses the sound effects from Pac-Man.  Oh, God.  You'll get an extra life if you get 69 points.  That's clever, right? 
[02:05:00]  You know, there's really something wrong with this whole scene.  You gotta be a total...  ...whore to stand naked at the bottom of a building with your mouth wide open to catch...  ...from some guy...  ...on top of a roof.  What kind of sick bitches are these?  And what's the deal with this guy?  Either he has a huge...  ...or he's a dwarf.  What the f*** kind of game is this?  Funny.  This guy has found his niche, obviously.  Angry video game nerd.  We gotta get him on the show.  I've been saying that for a while.  There are guys that are trying to rip him off, too, and do their own, like, angry video game reviews. 
[02:05:30]  He's the innovator.  He found a niche.  He was able to do it and pull it off, and he's very popular.  You can tell he's authentic, too.  You can tell that's his thing.  Yeah, he knows the games.  He's not overacting or anything.  This is just how he is in his regular life.  We gotta get him on the show, please.  Have we...  Oh, we're trying?  What's the answer, man?  We've been trying since we had...  He's so famous that we can't get him on the show.  He's a fan of the show.  He's got a wow sticker in some of these videos.  Yeah, I saw that.  That are on YouTube.  Yeah.  All right, let's move on, because we're running out of show here.  Another game that was a porno game for the Atari system. 
[02:06:00]  This is Bachelorette Party and Bachelor Party.  All right, now here's one for the girls.  It's called Bachelorette Party.  Yeah, it's a whole bunch of naked dudes.  Whoa, watch out, guys.  It's some crazy bitch bouncing off the walls, and it hardly even looks like a girl.  I mean, look at this.  It could be Swamp Thing, for all I care.  The gameplay's basically like Breakout, but flipped on its side.  You control that thing on the left to catch the girl and just bang all the guys.  What a whore.  Now here's one for the guys. 
[02:06:30]  It's Bachelor Party.  It's the same exact game, except it's a dude going around having sex with a bunch of girls.  What a stud.  This one's called Gigolo.  The idea is that you're this nude woman on the streets going around breaking into random houses  where you find men to have your way with.  What?  The sounds are amazing.  Some of these are better to watch in video form, obviously, but great audio.  Moving on, this is a game called Philly Flasher. 
[02:07:00]  It always sounded like static.  Huh?  It always sounded like static, the sound effects.  Right.  Throw a fourth sound in there, maybe.  The boo-doo-doo.  Yeah.  What is that?  No sound is like that in real life.  Boo-doo-doo-doo.  It sounds like nothing.  Boo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Here's the Philly Flasher.  Now we got Philly Flasher.  Somebody please explain this one to me.  Philly Flasher? 
[02:07:30]  Like Philadelphia?  What's Philadelphia make you think of?  Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, Rocky, Cheesesteaks, a witch shooting milk at her?  Well, there's no doubt that the game could take place in any city and that the title's only  phonetic.  It might as well be Chicago...  Dallas...  The game's basically the same as Beat'em and Eat'em.  The only difference is that it's two guys drinking milk from a witch's...  This game really disturbs me, but I don't get it.  Is this supposed to be erotic?  I don't know about you, but I'm not at all turned on by some old wrinkly... 
[02:08:00]  That's nasty, man.  What sick came up with this?  What were they thinking?  The Philly Flasher, so it's a witch?  A witch, and you got a drink, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  What were they thinking?  Like, that...  Somebody actually said, I got an idea for a game.  Yeah.  And it's like, yeah, okay, get the programmers on that.  I guess it would be obviously funny before erotic, because that just sounds ridiculous. 
[02:08:30]  For like...  You know what it was?  For like two seconds, on a whim, you'd probably buy the game and go, oh, let me check this  out, and then you're like...  Oh, this sucks.  Oh, well.  Back to back, man.  Yeah.  Finally, we got Night on the Town.  Spelled with a K?  Yes, and then, uh, comma, Jungle Fever.  Now we got Night on the Town.  I suppose you're a knight, and you're on a quest for the holy ass.  That's right.  Your goal is that princess on the top of the castle.  What he wants to do with her? 
[02:09:00]  Well, take a guess.  So, as usual, the object's pretty simple.  You just grab the blocks and build the bridge, but watch out for that crazy monster, and if  the alligators get you, they bite your d*** off.  There's no point of walking because he's so damn slow, so you just gotta keep jumping  and keep in rhythm so you don't hit the monster or the alligators.  I don't have any idea what these things on their heads are.  They look like Dr. Seuss characters.  But one thing I never expected to see Dr. Seuss characters do is this. 
[02:09:30]  All right, just one more game because I've had enough.  This one is Jungle Fever.  I like to call it Jungle Fever.  Well, honestly, I don't know what to say about this one.  How did they come up with this stuff?  All right, guys, let's have a naked, big-breasted woman hanging from a helicopter shooting at  flames with a naked guy in between, and some cannibal bitches, I guess, trying to kill you.  What the f***?  The goal is to put out the flames and rescue them, and to celebrate, why not? 
[02:10:00]  There you go.  You can check out those videos on YouTube, obviously.  It's Angry Video Game Nerd.  He's entertaining.  All right.  I don't like the fresh talk.  You know, what's the sound for Monday at?  Boo-doo-doo.  This should be.  This is the sound you're listening for on Monday's Opie and Anthony show between 7 and 7.30  if you want to win $1,000.  Damn!  You've just been pwned!  And, uh...  And that's that.  And we got tonight... 
[02:10:30]  Oh, sorry.  I just wanted to say damn.  Plug gigs.  Patrice tonight at, uh, Stress Factory, uh, in New Brunswick, Vinny's Fine Establishment  in New Brunswick.  Yes.  Uh, 7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, ha, ha, revolting, but memorable, um, tonight, tomorrow, uh, Patrice,  and I'll be in Queensbury, New York, at the Saratoga Comedy Club.  The Saratoga Comedy Club?  Yes, but it's in the Sweet Basil Restaurant.  What?  I'm working on an hour of material, so I'm going into very small rooms and just going 
[02:11:00]  out and working on material.  Another special?  I don't know.  Eventually, I would like to, but people are going to come out and see me.  Oh, this is for your own ethic?  This is for your own work ethic?  I can't have...  You can share your work ethic?  That didn't bother me.  That's why I tore my tongue up.  I'll tell you why.  He's reporting he's a hard-working little Bumblebee?  I want people to know they're not going to see the same material as HBO, or they won't  come out and see me.  It's selfish.  People are going to know they're not going to come out and see me when I'm doing big gigs,  because there's the HBO stuff.  Yeah, you get to see Jimmy working on the new stuff, and it's funny. 
[02:11:30]  The reviews coming in, people are like, man, he's worked on stuff.  Jimmy's not a lazy comic.  It's only because I want people to come out and see me when I'm doing gigs.  A lazy human.  You make me sick.  Oh, I'm just doing the best I can.  Really fast, because we talked about it, we got a taste of Patrice's podcast.  Yeah, patriceoneal.com.  No, we got an actual little...  It's really quick.  We got you giving the kitten a pep talk before he goes into battle.  You won, Fluff. 
[02:12:00]  You won.  But you didn't win, win.  You could have cost me $350.16.  So next time you fight, you better win, win.  Feel me?  That's both of them.  I'm going to drown you in a cup of water.  A cup of water.  We were drowning kittens in water.  It's such a little cute, adorable kitten he's holding.  All you see is his head and his tail in my hands.  Yeah, he's...  I'm going to drown you in a cup of water.  Unbelievable.  Go to Patrice O'Neal for more of that. 
[02:12:30]  Wait, is that thing that you're doing with Dante, is that that?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, man.  Yeah, I've heard it's really funny.  That's right.  You were out of the studio for a while.  Yeah, we were talking about...  No, I didn't realize you were talking about the same thing.  No worries.  People talk about this thing you've been doing with...  Shut up, hard worker.  You bug me.  My nickname's 110% Jimmy.  My hour that I may do.  Just because I'm working hard.  I ought to smash with this orange.  Come to Queensbury and see who leaves it all on the stage in Orton.  Hey, guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday, all right? 
[02:13:00]  So long.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Talented comedian.  He's a very funny man.  Very popular comedian.  Great stand-up comedian.  Comedian.  Otto and George.

You're out of touch.  I'm out of time.  But come out of my head when you're not around.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Holy shit, are we stupid. 
[02:15:30]  This is the dumbest fucking thing we ever decided to do.  Have the walkover.  I think it's on.  I can hear me.  Yeah, we're on.  We're outside K-Rock here in New York City, walking down 57th Street toward XM Satellite Radio.  I want to tell people also, this isn't a worst of a walkover.  This is the first walkover we've done in quite some time.  And we picked the coldest day of the year.  We're a bunch of dummies.  And we're pushing this fucking embarrassing cart. 
[02:16:00]  This is fucking embarrassing.  I feel like we just landed and we're invading New York.  I think we found the first cell phone to help us with the walkover.  That is a bad movie prop.  It's awful.  It kind of looks like a wheelchair.  It's a wheelchair with, like, black fins on it that are pointed all willy-nilly in wacky directions that have no rhyme or reason.  Right now, Danny's going sterile from the radiation that they've probably given off. 
[02:16:30]  God, I wish I could have beat you motherfuckers on the elevator.  We ought to have been in XM right now.  We're just idiots.  We had the whole summer to do this.  We finally decided to do the walkover as the freaking weather has drastically changed.  I also want to thank Run for doing the walkover with us today.  Run's house.  I'm a big fan of Run's house there, Patrice.  That's a great hat if you're being shot in the Audubon ballroom.  We're walking with Clark Kent.  I have a seasonable day. 
[02:17:00]  I have a personal code where I don't discuss dressing with white people.  I'm a good dresser.  There's not one nicely dressed guy.  The worst dressers are white people.  I can't get rid of it.  You annoy me.  Actually, he looks like the black version of Perry White.  He looks Perry White.  Oh!  Where's that car crash?  That's a good one, Perry White.  Perry White doesn't dress like this, nigga.  He's got the same fucking hat.  Patrice is wearing a very old...  Why does it have to be seasonably cold? 
[02:17:30]  It's almost...  It was fucking 80 degrees and everyone was pitching.  You wish you had my Perry White hat, nigga.  That's what I'm talking about.  Exactly.  That is a Perry White hat.  It's kind of a...  I'm sticking with that line.  You're staying with it.  You're staying with that one.  Perry White, the reporter.  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm not a trench coach.  He was the...  Perry White was the head guy for Super Bowl.  The head guy, yes.  Thank you.  I need my parka.  Why are you standing here?  Let's get this show on the road.  Let's get this stupid wheelchair fucking show on the road.  I'm just going to stand behind the fruit of Islam. 
[02:18:00]  The fruit of Islam.  By the way, we want to acknowledge all the people that came out today.  Thank you, guys.  That's where you yell and scream, yes.  Red rum wore a skirt.  How fantastic.  What a trooper.  Are you running the marathon, sir?  Holy shit.  Who are you?  Oh, this guy's a horrible bore.  David?  Yes.  What?  Are you a fan?  I'm an absolute fan.  Oh, now it's fucking windy, too.  How dewy can he be?  I can give a shit about this fucking jogger guy.  I'm cold. 
[02:18:30]  That's all I care about is me being fucking cold.  It really is fucking freezing out here.  We all just got little sweatshirts on.  What happened?  It was, like, warm this morning.  It was, right?  Bastards.  All right.  All right.  This is what the walk-in is going to be.  Why are you walking with Gilbert Gottfried from Beverly Hills Cop 2?  Tell his divorce lawyer to get out of my way. 
[02:19:00]  Jeez, look at this.  Look at these mummies in New York that just, it's just, what's going on?  Nothing.  Just get on the bus.  Holy shit.  Well, it's parka time.  I'm going to have to pull out that ridiculous parka everyone makes fun of.  What are you carrying in your little duffel bag, Anthony?  I never saw you with a little duffel bag.  Medicine.  Ixnay on the Ufflday Ag Bay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Automatic weapons and pills.  Oh.  Exactly. 
[02:19:30]  He's carrying around his own pharmacy at this point.  I said, pharmacy and weapons.  Don't fuck with me.  I swear to God.  Hey, at least we're not those guys.  That sucks right there.  Yeah.  Are you taking a hole in this weather today?  I bet they don't feel cold.  They're working.  You think so?  No, that sucks.  Fellas.  They want nothing to do with us.  I want to just fucking shovel dirt. 
[02:20:00]  How mad would they be if we just started kicking the dirt on them?  All right.  Just rebury them.  What happened?  Are all these people...  Ah, shake it up.  Ah, Philly.  Man.  I'd love to hang out with everybody.  I'm freezing.  All right.  What's happening?  We'll just get everyone upstairs and do this in a warm climate.  We'll let you guys all up.  That's some pernt.  All right.  There's the first walkover in a very, very long time.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be upstairs in a moment.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:20:30]  The virus is spitting.  XM 202.  Hey, what's up?  We're here.  Still trying to get comfortable.  I don't know.  No, no.  No time.  No time for that.  Am I on?  We got...  Oh, my headphones.  There we go.  Yeah.  See, that's why we usually play a little something before...  Don't be crazy, but I'd rather hear a 10-minute bit where we're being funny and entertaining 
[02:21:00]  than that crap.  And that's just going, hello, hello.  That walkover shit.  Walkover's for the birds.  I like to say.  Well, we're going to do the walkover, what, once a week or something?  Every Friday?  Are we?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  It's up to you.  It is up to us.  The listener's bitch, but...  You know what?  I don't know.  It's not that great.  It isn't.  I don't like it at all.  I like walking with the fans and the listeners and then bringing them up here and having fun  that way.  Oh, they're fun.  But I think they're confused.  They don't think we're having people up to the studio anymore. 
[02:21:30]  They need to hear the walkover and then realize, hey, they're walking.  We'll walk.  You can come by any day.  Why wouldn't they think we have...  Check out the show.  We got the bleachers and everything.  A live audience.  Patrice, have you been in here?  Oh, yeah.  The last time you were in here, we...  Hold on.  I got to find you.  This place is magnificent.  Yeah, the last time...  I can't get over this place.  You haven't been on this side of the studio, though.  No, we sat in that chair where I almost went into a complete coma.  Oh, man.  I did once.  Very comfortable, lazy boys just sitting back.  That is ridiculous. 
[02:22:00]  You should put barbed wire and that stuff to keep pigeons from landing on the roof over there.  Yeah.  There's no need to be that comfortable.  I agree with this guy.  It's Dan from Ohio.  What a bunch of tools.  You all wait for the first morning with frost to do the walkover.  Yeah, we had all summer to do that and decided today was the day to do it.  Dumb move.  Well, not all summer.  Sweet assholes.  To be fair, over the last month or so.  It hasn't been the end of the world hot, man, so it's just like, you know...  It's good to know.  Yeah, I like that stuff.  It's good to know that God has decided not to, like, burn the earth, you know, this year. 
[02:22:30]  Global warming.  Anthony, you're a smart guy when it comes to certain things.  I give you supreme credit.  Thanos, too.  How long have we been doing heavy industry?  I don't believe in the global warming thing only just because I don't...  I think we haven't been doing heavy industry enough to destroy the earth.  I think this is just almost like an ice age climate change that we happen to be living  in the middle of.  The industrial age pretty much started at the beginning of the 1900s.  I don't think that...  I don't think this earth, because of this, because back in the day when it was just volcanoes 
[02:23:00]  and dinosaur farts, there was so much stuff going up in the air from volcanic ash that  I don't think our goofy cars could make a dent in the earth, and I just believe that...  I want to believe the global warming thing just because it's democratic and it'll go against,  you know, racist white people thinking, but I just think we're in the middle of something  like the ice age, and we're just, you know, in the middle of it.  I think we're much too self-centered as humans.  We think a little too much of ourselves.  Like, we have the power to, you know, change the weather. 
[02:23:30]  I just don't believe in it.  Depending on what we do.  I don't believe in it at all.  I don't think we do that much.  And I don't believe that a meteor, when he hits the earth, is going to destroy the entire earth.  No, it doesn't.  It just wipes out, like, makes the living conditions for us fucked up.  It doesn't hurt the planet long term.  No, I'm talking about us.  I know what you're saying.  I think you're right based on the news.  I think that whoever the...  Where the meteor hits is going to kill people in that immediate area.  I don't think it's going to be a cataclysmic destruction of life on this planet.  I have to disagree.  Did you see footage of Comet Shoemaker-Levy when it hit Jupiter? 
[02:24:00]  Jewish Comet.  Comet Shoemaker-Levy.  It made...  A dot and nothing happened.  ...impact things the size of the earth.  Those little dots were things the size of the earth.  Those clouds.  Yes.  They would have...  And they said multiple times ended life as we know it on earth and we've been hit by one of those things.  If we get hit by something bigger than earth...  No, no.  They were small.  They weren't bigger than earth.  They were small.  But they had such an impact.  The damage was bigger than earth.  Yeah.  I think I agree with Patrice, though, because I'm kind of thinking they're blowing it out 
[02:24:30]  of proportion.  Oh.  All right.  Like the news always does.  We've got a big star waiting, so we can go back to that.  And we also want to get this info out immediately.  Matt in...  Queensburg.  Oh, hello, Matt in Queensburg.  Is this Matt LaFaugh?  It sure is.  From Queensburg.  This is the famous Matt LaFaugh.  We read his instant feedback.  Is this the first time we've had you on the air?  I've been on a couple times.  I was on with John Mayer.  He sang a song for my girlfriend so she wouldn't hate me way back when. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, okay.  Sure.  But I'm calling to beg for Jimmy's help.  The tickets are sold out for the one show that I can go to, which is the early Saturday  show.  That's always sold out, but we'll make sure we get you in.  This is a big 125-seat venue.  I am finished.  I'm finished.  I'll make sure I get you.  How many do you need?  Please say 100.  I would say fuck my friends because I'm doing all the legwork here, but I guess two, I guess. 
[02:25:30]  Two I can do.  Any of your other friends, tell them just to buy tickets for the late show.  This is kind of cool.  I feel like I'm talking to a famous person.  This is the great Matt LaFaugh from Queensbury.  How do you say Queensbury?  Well, now I say it like that.  Before, in the olden days, we used to say Queensbury.  Oh, no.  But it's been updated.  I believe even on the maps, they've added some extra R's.  And they take away the U.  It's just Q-U-E-E-N-S-B, six R's, and a Y.  And the Y has that little motorhead, two dots over it. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know why they're there.  Queensbury.  Queensbury.  Now, also, I have a band gig, the late night on Saturday, which, Jimmy, I wanted you to stop by, if you'd like, after your late show.  I'd love to, but I'm not going to be able to.  Only because we're driving back that night, probably, unless somebody fucks me, and then we're staying.  Well, I can raise that, too.  So we're driving back.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  I can change the fuck part, but I know you have a girlfriend.  So what's the name of your band, buddy? 
[02:26:30]  King's English.  King's English?  Yeah.  Ah, in Queensbury.  King's English.  King's English in Queensbury.  What kind of music does the King's English perform?  Well, it's a cover band, and we do, you know.  Play the lute?  Pretty much everything.  We do, we have a lute, and we have, we do some klezmer, and it's a pretty good operation.  I know some wacky instruments.  All right.  All right.  Well, good luck to you, man, and I'm looking forward to meeting you.  Yeah, me too.  So what, I'll just be able to come up and say who I am, and they'll let me in?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And leave your information. 
[02:27:00]  I actually don't.  Yeah.  Yeah, do that.  Nah, we got to take care of Matt from Queensbury.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  We'll figure something out.  Get his name, at least, and Kenny will figure something out.  Matt Lefa.  Hey, we have an old friend stopping by.  Patrice.  No, fuck him.  What?  Hey.  Jesus, a pal.  Is he?  Is he really?  Is he really?  Let's be honest.  Is he really?  Let's talk about this.  Paperwork out there.  That is true.  I was actually hurt.  I didn't get invited to that Memorial Day party.  I would have went.  Shut up, no.  I would have.  Hello, sir.  Wow, that's what I mean. 
[02:27:30]  How are you?  Hey, dude.  Looking like an actor or something.  Like a businessman.  What the fuck are you doing?  I don't know what the hell happened.  He is beautiful right now.  What happened to Chris Jericho?  How beautiful Chris looks.  I am now Chris Jericho, famous author.  So he has to dress the part and everything?  Yes, I have to dress.  I have a monocle and an ascot and a pipe, and I sit in front of a raging fire reading  segments from my novel.  Is this a different book than you plugged on the Bronx Bunny? 
[02:28:00]  Or is this the same book?  Oh, it's the same one that just finally came out.  I've been working on it for like a year and a half.  I told you about the Bronx Bunny.  I thought that was hilarious, dude, that Bronx Bunny thing.  Bronx Bunny is this show from Ireland, and it's like these guys who have, they're like  puppeteers, and these puppets interview you.  Gotcha.  But the thing is, once you start the interview, you don't even realize there's a guy on the  floor who's like manipulating the puppets.  You actually, and they're really great.  They like really insult you, and it's just a wide open show.  It's a lot of fun.  It's kind of like this one, actually.  And you're just talking to the fucking puppet.  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:28:30]  You're getting insulted by the puppet.  It's like, hey, you fucking suck.  And it's like, shut up, puppet.  It was the best one.  He goes, the puppet goes, because Chris would be like going, you know, he would start at  something, and he'd go, yeah, you know, and then they would go, will you just answer  the fucking question?  I can't.  I just talk for hours.  Wait, can we get that audio?  I can't do it.  Will you just answer the fucking question?  I remember this now.  Yeah, we've played some segments from that show.  Let's find the one that Chris Jericho was on.  The Bronx Bunny.  The Bronx.  It's been a while, man.  Where have you been?  It has been, man.  It's fun to see you guys again. 
[02:29:00]  It's funny, because we were trying to get through, and they're like, I don't know, new  producer, old producer.  And I was like, I'm going to call Opie and Anthony, or no producer.  Yeah, we call it no producer.  I'm just going to show up outside the window and go, Opie, remember me?  Yeah, man.  I've just been working on this book, and I've been doing a couple other things, but fucking  writing a book, man.  I got to be honest, I haven't been able to read it yet.  There's so many authors coming by these days.  I got, like, they're stacking up in my house.  Because I really try to read a little before you guys come in, but I'll tell you this much.  It's called A Lion's Tale by Chris Jericho. 
[02:29:30]  And right on the front cover, Mick Foley writes, thoughtful, thorough, and laugh out loud, funny.  Jericho's book is winner.  And I've heard further from Mick that he's scared that your book is way better than his.  And I loved his book.  Well, that's the plug I'm giving you today.  Thank you.  That's all I can give you.  Well, I think this book's in the same vein as Mick's first one.  And obviously, that's kind of the top of the mountain you want to try and write that.  Because the reason why this book is a lot of fun is it's not just a book written for wrestling fans.  It's a book written for people that don't know about wrestling. 
[02:30:00]  Because it's more of the story of this dream I had from wanting to be a wrestler at eight years old,  watching wrestling with my grandma in her basement.  Forced to.  Well, I'll slow you down a second.  Who did you watch when you were eight?  AWA was from Minnesota.  Some of the guys, though.  So it was Hulk Hogan.  Okay.  When he first started before he went to WB.  And the guys like Nick Bockwinkle and Baron Von Raschke and all these wacky guys from Minneapolis.  And I watched Bugs Bunny at five.  And I watched Hockey Night in Canada at seven.  And wrestling was on in the middle.  But because my grandma was in charge of the TV, you couldn't change the channel. 
[02:30:30]  That's all there was to it.  You're watching wrestling.  So that's how I got into it right off the bat.  And then soon afterwards, I was like, I'm going to do this.  I want to be a wrestler.  Right.  I don't know how I'm going to do it.  I'm eight years old.  I'm like eight years old.  So I left home.  Yeah.  The Child League, which was really underground.  It was a sweatshop.  Finding kids.  Yeah.  So that's kind of the deal.  And this is how I followed my dream of becoming a wrestler.  But all around the world, going to Mexico and Japan and Germany and all these different places.  And not just the things that happened in the ring, but some of the things that happened outside of the ring. 
[02:31:00]  The life-threatening situations and the dangerous things that happened.  So that's the tale.  I think that's why people are digging it.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah, man.  Was it hard to write?  I'll tell you what.  I thought, well, I'm going to write this book.  I know Jimmy just wrote a book, too.  Dude.  And he just made it seem like it was easy.  Well, then he's a genius, man.  Because it took me about 18 months to write this thing.  And even crazier was that we had twins last summer.  And I have a son, too.  So my wife would be with the twins. 
[02:31:30]  I'd put my son to bed at 10.  I'd write from 10 to 3 in the morning.  Then get up with my son at 7.  And that was my schedule for like 18 months.  It was like being a radio host or something like that.  You wrote five hours a night.  That's amazing, though, to do that.  You have to kind of do that, too.  Like, just regiment yourself.  And I was never able to do that.  It's tough.  And then, you know, I'm such a control freak.  I edited it myself.  I wrote all the copy and everything.  Picked the pictures.  Picked the captions.  But once again, I think that's why it works.  Because if this is my story, I don't want anybody else writing it.  Right, right.  No one else is going to know how to do it like I can.  You're happy with the way it came out, right? 
[02:32:00]  It's exactly the way I wanted it.  It was obsessively good.  Exactly.  Because I'm obsessed with it.  I'm an idiot.  You do a good show, too, on XM, man.  Do you still do the show?  I got fired off XM.  Why?  Sorry.  They had a new program.  Way to go, Jimmy.  Way to go.  It was on Sunday nights, and you played good stuff, man.  For two years, I had the show, and then I got a new program director, and you guys  know how that works.  Wait, what show did you do?  I was on the Boneyard.  Yes.  It was called The Rock.  Best station on, next to this one.  It was called, close, man.  And what, you just played whatever you wanted?  Yeah, The Rock of Jericho, it was called, and I did it for two years. 
[02:32:30]  Two hours, man.  It was fun, but then I had a new program director.  What were your favorite hair bands growing up?  I was more of the hardest stuff.  Although Boneyard's more than hair bands.  Yeah.  That's not fair, really.  I was more of a Maiden guy, Iron Maiden.  Iron Maiden?  D.O.  and those type of guys.  How about you, Patrice?  What was your favorite hair metal band?  I knew a lot of them.  Patrice knows white stuff.  I know he does.  I know what you were doing, Chris, but he'll have an answer for you.  I'm trying to stop reading the paper.  You know what?  That's very fair of you, because I'm doing some asshole shit right now. 
[02:33:00]  The shit you were talking about, it was just bugging me.  So, let me...  He was reading the paper, man.  He was reading the sports section.  I was just seeing how many stars they gave American Gangster, and you know what?  Patrice had a great way.  You know what?  You're fucking absolutely right.  I was just disgusting.  I don't know what you know.  You have a great way of making people feel insignificant.  Right.  You're talking about, this is my life.  Once upon a time.  Yeah, he's really pouring his soul out.  That's bullshit.  Everybody's figuring out names of books. 
[02:33:30]  I'm going to call it.  So, he was going through them like, hmm, first one is Top Rope.  Your favorite hair band, Patrice.  Let's go.  Favorite hair band.  He'll have an answer for you, Chris.  I would say, um...  Sabbath.  No.  No, that wasn't a hair band.  No, that wasn't a hair band.  Who said that?  Chris would agree that Ozzy was a hack.  You would agree with that, right?  No, I can't, man.  You know, I...  I just want one guy to say it in front of Jimmy.  Hair bands were very, um, one-hit wonder-ish.  So, I can't imagine there was a... 
[02:34:00]  There was a one that was like, this hair band here got mixed in with all of it.  They were great.  It seemed like they were...  Motley Crue?  Well, there's a couple that stuck out more.  Come on, I feel the noise.  A bunch of that, man.  Ah, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.  But that's what they, you know...  It's Patrice O'Neal's favorite hitman.  I want to rock!  And Twisted.  Twisted Sister.  Come on, let's go.  I don't know any other Twisted...  Uh, uh...  Motley Crue.  You know Motley Crue.  I would, uh...  Would you...  Welcome to the Jungle!  Guns N' Roses.  Guns N' Roses.  It's hardly a one-hit wonder.  One of the greatest bands ever.  Let me tell you that.  A hit wonder, maybe?  No, no. 
[02:34:30]  Guns N' Roses.  The most knowledgeable black man on white people I've ever known in my life.  I...  Ever.  I mean, to have the reference point, to pull it, but I know these...  He knows us like one learns their enemy.  He doesn't like white stuff.  He studies white people so he can hurt us with our own information.  He's the art of war.  He uses it against us.  That's right.  Of course, he does.  He sucks a lot of war.  When it comes to Twisted Sister.  He hates all things white.  But he knows them all, yeah.  It was back...  There was a time...  I don't think we talked about before, but there was a time where you knew each other's 
[02:35:00]  music.  There was a time where, like right now, there's gotta be a bad time for white music because  I know nothing.  You don't hear it, but I was forced to listen to it growing up.  You just heard white music.  I knew R.E.M.  I knew this, that, and a third.  Now I don't know anything, but I knew Twisted Sister.  But you're kind of right, though.  There's not a lot of new bands that are really that popular that are crossing over.  I can't even think of hardly any new bands that I like recently.  White people music is dead right now. 
[02:35:30]  I hit...  You don't like...  I don't hit...  You don't like Wolf Mother.  I like Wolf Mother.  I like Avenged Sevenfold.  There's a couple bands that are pretty cool.  You know what I'm saying?  But it's not like he's saying like it was back in the day when everyone knew who Quiet  Riot was, or everyone knew who...  Let's not forget that we're talking to the lead singer, Fozzy, here.  That's right.  Absolutely.  Which I...  To this day, and this is what I'm saying, if I really was deep, deep entrenched, I would  go...  I would...  I just thought you were doing a wrestling thing.  I did not realize.  I thought it was a work.  Right.  That's right.  I just didn't realize this was a serious thing for you.  The first time I ever did ONA was when I first started Fozzy. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, you...  Fuck.  You wouldn't break character.  Doing like a Spinal Tap Blues Brothers thing where I came in as Moon Goose McQueen, which  was my alter ego.  Moon Goose.  We were calling you Mule Juice.  Mule Juice.  Mule Juice McDick.  The first time, like, you guys didn't know who I was.  I didn't know who you guys were.  It was come a long way, Chris.  It was so funny, because you guys were trying to make me break character.  I wouldn't do it.  You were busting my balls.  I was busting your balls.  The best thing was...  You guys probably remember this.  Andrew Dice Clay was there.  And Dice was...  He didn't have a clue what was going on.  He was like, well, is this guy a wrestler? 
[02:36:30]  Is he a singer?  And you guys were going, he's a wrestler.  And I'm going, I'm a singer.  He goes, listen, he says he's a singer.  He's a singer.  Give him a break.  So it was Jericho and Dice versus Opie Anthony.  Moon Goose McQueen.  What pissed us off, too, because we were huge fans of your wrestling back then, especially.  And we're like, fuck this stupid music thing.  We want to talk to Chris Jericho, the wrestler.  Just how insane was it at the time?  Because the Fozzy thing did take off, and it became, you know, this thing for a while.  There was so much going on with your character at the time.  We wanted to kind of talk about that. 
[02:37:00]  And you wouldn't even fucking break character.  I was being so pretentious.  Oh, you were.  We used to make fun of your pebbles hairdo and everything.  Everything, man.  It's so funny, though.  Now we're like, buzz.  That's what a way to start.  Oh, my God.  You got us so pissed off.  We actually were calling your hair to a cum fountain.  Right.  You guys were so mad at me.  Yeah.  It was so funny.  And can I ask you?  That was awful.  You was a heel during the time of Fozzy, right?  And so would you be, since it was a serious thing, was you upset when the crowd would boo 
[02:37:30]  you, like, because you was a heel, but you was actually doing your good music, and they  like, fuck Chris Jericho at the time?  It was tough, because, yeah, when we first started, like, it was just a total schitzel  thing.  I was doing the Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton.  Like, I was not Chris Jericho.  I was Moon Goose.  I came from Japan.  Chris Jericho was a fan of mine.  And a couple times we played live, and people would start to boo, and at the time it was  cool.  Like, this is great.  And then after a while, like, man, we really fucked ourselves, because people booed this  as, like, a heel thing.  That's a good question. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  And then when, you know, then when we took it more of a serious thing, people didn't  know if it was real, is it bullshit.  So it was kind of a weird place, because at first it was just a fun thing.  We did it just for fun, and then we started getting really good, and then we said, well,  we should try and take this a little bit further.  But because we started in such a weird way, it was hard to kind of break out of that.  But we finally ended up doing that, like you said.  Now you're doing the WWE, like, I see a lot of stuff when the WWE guys branch off into different  areas.  Like, I've seen Condemned.  Condemned was pretty good, by the way, with Steve Austin.  I enjoyed that movie.  Oh, did he really? 
[02:38:30]  I liked the movie.  That was the, he was a convict on an island or whatever.  He was a convict, and I thought that it was pretty damn good, and he didn't overdo it.  But, like, are you doing your stuff now with all this WWE thing attached?  Like, can you be just Chris Jericho by yourself?  Or no?  He hasn't wrestled in a while, but there's a heavy rumor, I mean, rumor, that he's going  back.  He ain't going back.  This dude is an actor.  He's going back.  See his muscles?  See his arms?  He's lost weight.  Freak.  Are you insane?  No, no, no, no, no.  He's in shape.  He's a regular guy in shape now.  Do you see The Rock now? 
[02:39:00]  He's a regular guy big.  He's skinny guy.  He's not wrestling big anymore.  He's regular, in shape, normal guy big now.  And that's, he's not going back to no fucking wrestling.  No.  So, even if he did, it's all about personality.  And a lot of guys have forgotten that nowadays.  Now, you, did you guys know that Patrice actually worked in the WWE?  He used to write.  He used to write there for, how long?  Like a month?  A month?  I got fired.  Seriously.  I'm not even joking.  Look, let me tell you something.  When you're in that thing, it's like you got to be in it.  And I just wasn't in it. 
[02:39:30]  And I just had to get fired.  But I loved it.  But my thing is when I met.  Did Vince McMahon fire you personally?  No.  Angry Vince?  Stephanie did.  He didn't go.  You're fired.  You're fired.  And she fired me.  And she fired me.  Patrice, I'd like to see you in my office.  She fired me eight times.  You stink.  You know, I've been going through some of your writing, and it stinks.  Let me tell you something.  You know how you're proud of something?  I'm going to write my own material.  I got a little sketch I want to run past you right about now. 
[02:40:00]  How about this one?  You write me something.  I think it sucks ass, and you're fine.  You like that sketch?  Do you like it?  He was very, he was, I told you guys that I've only had, I've only blinked slow at three  dudes in my life.  Like, where I'm just like, you're only back in tears. 
[02:40:30]  It was just, you know, what's that music?  And he was one, because it was just, his aura was magnificent.  And none of the wrestlers had that.  Like, when I was doing it, I met the wrestlers, like, hey, what's happening?  Like, Tess is as big of a human being as you can see.  But you just go, hey, how you doing?  And at that time, I didn't meet him at the time, but he was one of the big heavies.  He's like one of the guys that could ride in a jet from where they're going to the next 
[02:41:00]  day, and then everybody else had to, like, use a skateboard, or fucking be on a train.  We didn't associate with the lowly riders.  They sat in the front, and the riders were in the back with a plane, you know.  You were on Vince's plane and all that?  The riders go with Vince.  Wow.  The riders stay with Vince.  The riders don't get there on their own, because they got to write the shows.  And the thing that was great about Vince.  And they got ten wrestlers in a van piling in. 
[02:41:30]  Piling in, but it would be arena to arena.  It would be him.  But you were one of the guys that got.  The Undertaker, Stone Cold, The Rock, and maybe now Rey Mysterio might be on.  But the guy with the pituitary gland thing, he's not on.  The giant Indian who should just be removed from wrestling.  The pituitary.  That's his gimmick.  Ladies and gentlemen, weighing 500 pounds, the pituitary gland.  Where he has Rey Mysterio's legs and Kane's body. 
[02:42:00]  Kane's upper torso.  They've been trying to get the new Andre the Giant for years.  Forever.  And the giant, Big Show was him.  But I don't know what happened.  But Big Show was him.  Big Show is definitely the new Andre the Giant, I was going to say.  You were a guy that was the headliner for wrestling.  You told me about him.  Is he still the same dude?  He was like a young guy?  Yeah, a little white dude.  He's the guy.  He's like.  No way is he going to be a white dude.  He's the guy.  Because he is.  He's not a little black dude.  He can't just be a dude.  Yeah.  No.  He's a little dude. 
[02:42:30]  I'm tired of white people trying to make things colorless.  Because you can't say nigger no more.  I can still be racial.  Hey, you can say it.  We can't.  Yes, indeedy.  Yes, indeedy.  Yes, indeedy.  I like to use race to describe things.  So do we.  We're just not allowed anymore.  Yes, we can't do that.  About our balls cut off.  Right.  So you'd be in the plane riding and the big stars would be in the front of the plane.  It would be.  Going from arena to arena.  It wasn't him, but I knew who the guys was.  It would be Triple H without a question. 
[02:43:00]  And I think the pecking order is probably.  Triple H is the top of the pile because he's married to his daughter for one.  And he's just, you know, the dude.  But Undertaker, very close.  Jericho is very close.  Stone Cold, very close.  In terms of they got, because they would do, they would work every goddamn day.  But then it would be like, I would say seven guys that can get on a plane with Vince and  be comfortable.  That weren't.  I'm like, who?  It was, it was.  Who else would you say?  I didn't miss anybody.  You got them all.  You got them all.  Yeah, it's all of them. 
[02:43:30]  And the rest is.  Right.  Are they nervous around Vince?  Because I don't know.  Not dudes like him.  Dudes who can talk are not nervous around Vince.  Dudes who can do a shoot interview.  The Kurt Angles.  The guys who can talk.  You know what it is, it's just, like you said, it's a very intimidating presence when  you first start out until you have that confidence and have a little bit of leverage.  I mean, still, of course, you're still scared of him.  He's your boss.  I mean, sometimes you want to kill him.  But it's one of those things, after a while, you just got to treat him like a normal guy.  He's got so many yes men surrounding him.  He's sick of yes men. 
[02:44:00]  So you got to sometimes just tell him, you know, listen.  I didn't get a harumph out of you.  This coffee is too cold.  Yes, boss.  Yes, boss.  Thank you, sir.  What about me, boss?  Bad idea.  What about me, boss?  Hey, guys, hey, guys, hey, guys.  So that's kind of the deal with that.  And you asked me before about if I could write this book within the WWE world.  Because I took a step back and not working with the company, I was able to write the  book the way I wanted to write it.  So this is your book.  This is my book.  It's not an association.  It doesn't even talk about the WWE.  It's just my time to get there.  It took me nine years to get there.  And this is the journey to get there. 
[02:44:30]  So which is good, because if I would have written it within their system, you'd probably leave  a few.  And you would have left a few things.  I remember the day you came in in 1999.  Right.  That's right.  Good memory.  Because the whole thing was Y2...  Y2O.  Y2K.  Oh, Y2K.  No, Y2O.  Y2O.  It was the liquid version.  Y2K was the real thing.  And he was Y2J.  Right.  And they got you into a thing.  They pushed him big right away.  Because what they would do is two guys you would get pushed by. 
[02:45:00]  Where they go, okay, they trying to make him big.  One, if you fucked around with Rock, and if you fucked around with The Taker, would be  like, okay, they trying to push him in.  And they put him on with The Rock right away on a word battle with The Rock.  Rock would go, it doesn't matter what you think at that time.  And they put him in when the Y2J character came out.  That's when they was like, damn, they trying to push.  They going to push this guy big.  You know what's funny?  Trying to explain to kids nowadays, and they ask me, what does Y2J mean? 
[02:45:30]  And I have to explain, the kid's like 10.  He doesn't know what Y2K is.  So trying to explain to Y2J, you just get this blank look of, that makes no sense.  It's like, well, it doesn't really make sense, but it would if you were like over 30.  It's a great nickname if you're older.  So you got beat up by Bret Hart's dad?  You was in the basement thing?  Yeah, actually, I moved from Winnipeg to Calgary.  Well, explain the basement.  That was a dungeon.  Bret Hart's father's dungeon.  Yeah, all the Canadian guys got beat up.  They had a dungeon there, it was called.  It was basically Stu Hart's basement, and it was a small little room, it had a low-hanging 
[02:46:00]  ceiling.  It looked like the basement from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where there's these pipes  everywhere.  Is that Stu on the phone?  I hope not.  Is that Kenny's phone?  I'm sorry.  Come on!  It's live radio.  We have to be professional here.  This gets Kenny very upset.  I'm ruining the show.  He will have apology emails to everybody.  As he should, because he ruins everything he touches.  I'm sorry.  It'll never happen again.  I went home and punished myself. 
[02:46:30]  And it wasn't even a phone call, it was probably a reminder of his to think a racist  thought.  I don't want that to ever die.  Fucking Kenny, I love him.  You know what's funny?  We're talking about Calgary.  Up in Calgary, there's a friend of mine who lives up in Calgary.  His name is Speewey.  He imitates you guys, because he listens to you all the time.  But he imitates this guy right here.  Oh, Jimmy?  What are you talking about?  Sounds like a racist thought.  And I'm like, what are you talking like?  He goes, oh, I listen to opening anything all the time.  He's imitating you guys all the way up in Canada in the middle of frickin' nowhere. 
[02:47:00]  People are imitating you, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Thanks.  Jimmy's fun to imitate.  Perfect.  You lay down, have a girl shit on you.  You married?  You married, Chris?  Yes, I am.  He's got the ring on.  How does a guy, good looking dude like you, like I got a girl and I'm trying hard and  I get married and the whole thing.  Was she there during the rough times?  And you're loyal to her kind of thing?  She was there from the beginning.  Two things.  One, she wasn't a wrestling fan.  I met her in a restaurant.  Two, I met her in 98 when I was still in WCW before I even really got to the, you know, 
[02:47:30]  quote, I guess, to the big leagues, right?  So, yeah, you know right from the start that she was there.  It wasn't just some kind of a money-hungry gold digger.  Yeah, so that's kind of why I think we were able to last for a while, for as long as we  have.  And a few kids now.  Three kids?  Three kids, yes, man.  Absolutely.  We have twins, like I said, and then a four-year-old son, too.  Twins or girls, Red Boy?  Girls.  Twin girls?  And it's funny, yeah, because now, like, they're only one, but the basic human instinct catches  on where, like, one of them will be holding something and the other one will come and 
[02:48:00]  just take it for no reason.  And the other one cries and then she just drops it.  And then they're stealing from each other.  They push each other down.  And they're just babies.  They don't know what they're doing, but that's the basic human nature.  Push someone down and steal their stuff.  Yes.  You see these things.  I'm looking at the book, and there's a picture of it, obviously, in the back that you weren't  going to include, which I found very interesting that you wrote that.  And you did eventually bring it in.  Which picture?  Obviously, throughout the course of this book, Chris Benoit is a huge part of it, because 
[02:48:30]  he was a big influence on me, both professionally and personally.  I met him in 92 in Calgary, and I was a fan of his from watching him, and he was only a  couple years older than me.  So he became like a big brother and a mentor, and we traveled the world together for years.  This story ends in 1999.  It's the story of my career, like I said, from 90 to 99.  So I finished the book in May, and then in June is when all the stuff happened with him.  So I went back, and I was able to go through the book, and I wanted to see how it would 
[02:49:00]  read and how it would resonate, knowing that I talked so positively about this guy and so  many great experiences, but then it ended off in such a horrible way.  So there was a picture of him and his wife and myself and Stu Hart at Owen Hart's funeral,  Stu's son.  And I was going to take the picture out, but then I thought to take it out would be to  suggest that they never existed, and they did exist, and this time frame happened.  So I left it in there.  I thought it would be like having something with the Twin Towers and editing it out.  Right, right, right. 
[02:49:30]  Just because it ended in a bad way still doesn't mean it didn't exist.  So what I did do is I wrote a forward that just said, you know, this is the guy that  I knew between these years, because it'd be like a big black cloud hanging over this  book.  It's a very funny, humorous, comedic, positive story.  But if you didn't address the Benoit situation, I think it would really read a little bit strange.  So I was able to go through and, you know, kind of write a little thing about it.  It sounds crazy, because every time there's something awful happens, people look back  at the person or their life and go, wow, was there anything that indicated what was coming? 
[02:50:00]  You look back on your history with him, and there's nothing you can look back on that  was an indicator, right?  No, absolutely not.  Like, if I had to go somewhere, I would have left my kids with him.  Like, that's how much my best friend that I ever had in the business, and that's what  makes it even harder.  Like, I have to deal with this every day.  Like, for other, you know, I'm not saying it in a bad way, but for other people, the  big story happens, and something else happens, and two months from now, it's kind of just,  oh, yeah, I remember that, the wrestler guy.  For me, it's like every day of my life, I have to deal with it and try and figure out,  you know.  What do you think it was?  I mean, was it just a moment of rage? 
[02:50:30]  I mean, we'll never know.  We're not wired to think that way.  I mean, if you get that insane or mental problem, or it could be demon possession for all  I know.  I have no idea.  There were never signs?  Never.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So, just, you know, it's something we've got to deal with, so.  And he was, he really helped out your career over the years.  Totally.  You guys were really close.  Professionally and personally.  You were close with Eddie Guerrero, too, right?  Yeah, very much so.  And he's now gone, as well.  He actually dedicated the book to Eddie way early on.  Yeah, he, that was a, that one was maybe even harder in a different way, because it was 
[02:51:00]  such a surprise and such a shock.  And Eddie was such a sweet guy, man, just a good dude, and, you know, had a lot of great  times with him.  And just the thing about the book, I mean, there's, I wrote a thing in the back of all  the guys that are in the book that actually aren't around to check it out.  There's Owen Hart, Owen Hart, Brian Pillman.  I mean, there's tons of guys.  You know, wrestling, it kind of gets glossed over.  Unless something bad happens, no one ever really hears much about the positive side of  it.  But it's such a difficult job, because there's only a handful of people in the world that  can do it at a high level. 
[02:51:30]  But there's millions of fans that want to see it everywhere, worldwide.  So, it's very mentally and physically taxing and grueling.  It's, you know, it's a tough job.  I have to say, dude, I know, and this is the thing, it's like, I'm a wrestling fan,  and, I mean, we're not going to gloss over it, because even Vince McMahon tries to give  it something else, because they know it's not, you know, a 200-pound man punching another  200-pound man in the face is death.  Yeah.  But to watch them, what they are, and I'm not trying to marginalize it, they are stuntmen 
[02:52:00]  who can act.  So, they're falling, like, after everything, there's a guy running in a room with some dude  trying to put his dislocated, you know, back in place.  Like a chiropractor who goes, hey, what you do, I think I probably slipped a disc in my  neck, and you just see it going crack back in.  All right, tomorrow, when you're on the bus, you got to do it again.  But you give them a piece of paper that you wrote words on, and they fucking just go, all 
[02:52:30]  right, they read it, and they go, all right, let me tell you something, motherfucker.  I'm going to knock your head off.  And then they fly through the air on tables and shit.  But, and it's a respect you should have, not on the fact that, okay, we know it's not  real, you didn't really kick him in his balls when you did this shit.  But show business.  Yeah, it's show business.  But it's, it's, dudes are talented.  Yeah, but there's also.  Talented guys.  They're also taking some real shots.  Wrestling did change.  Like, I, I was watching some old wrestling, it was on cable or something, and it was beyond 
[02:53:00]  fake, where they were barely hitting each other, but the new guys, they actually do hit  each other and take some shots, not, obviously not the over-the-top moves, but they're taking  some shots.  Yeah, you can make mistakes.  There's a guy who's not walking now.  Draws.  Draws.  Mistakes.  There's, there's a story in my book from when I was in Knoxville, I, I was practicing  before the match, and I, I broke my arm, literally, like I was looking at it, and had  this weird little divot in it, so I went to the hospital, he, he said, well, you gotta  have surgery right now, and I said, well, I just have this wrestling appearance I have 
[02:53:30]  to make, and I'll just, he goes, okay, well, tomorrow at 7 a.m., you  getting surgery, so, of course, I basically snuck out of the hospital, went  back to the arena, dumbest thing, put my gear on, the promoter was all, what the  fuck did you break your arm for, and I was like, don't worry, I'm still gonna  wrestle, okay, no problem, so then I went in the ring, I wrestled this match with a  broken arm, I had aspirin in my system, I was all, like, whacked out, and I got  cut open, I was bleeding, like, you know, looked like a reject from the Carrie  movie, like a bucket of blood just dumped all over me, and on the floor with a 
[02:54:00]  broken arm bleeding everywhere, and there's this puddle of blood, and  there's, like, this total stereotypical redneck hillbilly, he's wearing, like, the  overalls with the big gut hanging out, little cowboy, like, goofy cowboy hat, and  he might as well have, like, the hay straw, and he's like, that ain't real blood, and  I was thinking, like, fuck, he goes, that ain't real blood, and he puts his finger in  it, and he, like, tastes it, and he's like, yeah, that ain't real blood, and first I'm  like, fuck, how gross are you, and how does my DNA taste, and second of all, how could 
[02:54:30]  it not be real blood, I have no shirt on, when I have a magical pump in my pants, and  I got a magical pump in my pants, all right, but, you know, it's like, is this blood just  coming from nowhere, but, I mean, that's kind of some of the stuff that you go through,  but I just love that guy just licking the blood, like, mmm, that ain't real blood, let's do it.  I don't know what real blood tastes like.  Yeah, isn't anybody you fucking hate in a business, man?  Hey, dude, you know what, man, at this level, you're just a professional, you go out there,  some guys that rub you the wrong way, but it's business, you know, it's business.  Who rubs you the wrong way? 
[02:55:00]  This guy, you know, you want to get gossip.  Okay, not who, but what type of personality rubs you the wrong way?  Guys that take themselves too seriously, and that's a good way to ask that question, Patrice,  because at this stage of the game, like I said, I had this goal and this dream that I  accomplished, I win, I'm not bitter towards anybody, some guys are assholes, fuck them,  I don't care, I'm happy, you know, I did what I wanted to do, but guys  that take themselves too seriously, especially on this job, because this is show business,  and it's comedy, man, like just, you got to have fun with it and enjoy yourself, and  you know, it's not real, so...  Do you hit them a little extra hard? 
[02:55:30]  Well, not here, but overseas, you know, like when I first started going over to Japan,  for example, being a foreign guy, they don't like having the foreign guys over there as  much, at least they didn't used to in the early 90s, so it would be a little bit more  of a fight, you know, the first guy, the first match I ever had in Japan, I worked  to wrestle this guy called Weida, and he was a kickboxer who actually wore boxing gloves  in the ring, and this was before there was MMA, it was kind of this weird mixed martial  arts wrestling company, and this dude came in, man, and he wasn't pulling anything, he  was kicking me and punching me, like I could see it in his eyes, you know, who's this little 
[02:56:00]  fucking foreign guy, so you know what, he nailed me so hard, and I was just getting  the crap kicked out of me, and there was no rules in this company, it was called FMW,  so I just went to the floor, and I grabbed a chair, and I went back in the ring, and he  turned his back on the pretty boy, and I just, I hit him in the head as hard as I  could, with the chair, with the chair, I was like, fuck this, and man, you could just  see him, he just like wilted and just fell down, and after that he was very nice, very  easy to work with afterwards, but you know, you just kind of had to, kind of had to get  yourself some space and get a little respect, same thing in Mexico too, the foreign guys 
[02:56:30]  come in, they didn't like it, it was a little more of a shoot until they knew that you could  actually work together, and then the point of the business is to work together, it's like  improv comedy, you want to work together to put on the best show, and the more you put  the other guy over, the better it is for everybody, as a guy's about to hit you with  a chair, someone yells freeze, now you hit me with a rubber chicken, I hate being such  a giddy wrestling fan, it just bothers me, but I just love it, I just, you know, I just  love, where do you, you know, yeah, where do you guys hide the razor blades, I've always 
[02:57:00]  wanted to know that, it's a magician's secret, a lot of guys have different places to put  it, but it's an art form, man, because, because they could get in the way and then cut you  when you don't want to be cut, I'm sure that's happened, I always want to know that question,  I think I know actually, they put it like on the thigh, like the scrotum covers it on  the thigh, and they can act right in there, if you cut your horn off, that's just part  of the business, man, that's just the way it goes, but your forehead looks okay, you don't  have the dusty roads head, yeah, well that was more of a set, where him and Abdullah the 
[02:57:30]  Butcher used just, you know, butter knives, the road map on the foreheads, it's just hard  to look at it, some of the guys just took, you know, yeah, they were more careful, what  am I trying to say, they were more careful, that's for sure, there was guys in Mexico,  because they would wear masks there, they're all like cultural superheroes, like comic book  heroes, their chins would be totally scarred up, like they had a beard of scars, because  only their mouths are showing, so they couldn't do it under the mask, they would do their chin 
[02:58:00]  instead, so like these guys, like totally normal face, with like this horrible goatee  of scars, that sounds like a horror movie, goatee of scars, did you plan for the future  where you're like, look man, like in your contract, it was like, I will bleed only on  pay-per-views, no, you just do it, I mean, you're smart about it, yeah, like some guys  thought it was cool, like I'm gonna get bloody, I'm hardcore, and it's like, fuck man, you  just gotta, you're gonna look stupid, like in your 50, walking around with a road map  on your forehead. Did they tell you you had to get bloody for this one, that one, or  would it just be kind of like you said, this is a good one to get bloody on? Like I said, 
[02:58:30]  it's show business, man, so it's all an elaborate show, you know, like I said, that's the most  important thing, it's like a Shakespearean morality play for the modern era, there's  a good guy, there's a bad guy, there's a confrontation, there's a denouement, and there's  a finish, and then that's kind of, if Shakespeare was alive today, he'd be writing wrestling  shows. Do you have a favorite match ever? Got a lot of them, probably WrestleMania  19, against Shawn Michaels, in Seattle, at the Enormo Dome, or whatever the hell it was  called, it was a good one, because a lot of people said it was the best match on the  show, and at WrestleMania, it's like the Super Bowl, so if you want to get out there and 
[02:59:00]  put on a show, that's the time to do it, you know, and it was just cool to be at that  level, especially all these, you know, working at a kid's birthday party when I first started  getting paid a hot dog and a glass of orange juice, to, you know, being held up on the side  of the road by a chick in Mexico City, in the middle of nowhere, I picked her up, she was  going to take me to a party, her and her brother. Held up, like, oh, Rob? Yeah, Rob.  Banditos. Yeah, she was going to take me to a party, so we're driving, yeah, it wasn't  sexy, we're driving to this party, and her and I are making out in the back, and it's 
[02:59:30]  like, this is great, this is going to be a party, and this girl's hot, and I notice  it's getting more and more desolate until we're finally, like, in the middle of nowhere,  like, dude, there's nothing. Like, Mexico City, murder capital of the world. Holy shit.  So I go, where's this party at? And the guy's like, the party is, you know, right here,  and the gun right there, man, and if you've ever seen the beginning of the James Bond  films where, like, you see those grooves on the inside of the gun? Yeah, yeah. I never  knew what that was until I actually saw the grooves on the inside of the gun sticking in  my face. A guy or, you said a girl? A guy and a girl. Oh, I thought you just got robbed  by a girl. Even worse. Yeah, yeah, right, right. Let no girl do shit to me. Bitch, put your 
[03:00:00]  little pink gun away, fight. Yeah. What is it? I'm glad you added a man to that motherfucking  shit. Yeah, it was brutal, man.  And as they're driving away, I still have the taste of this girl's lipstick on my mouth,  and I'm thinking, this bitch just robbed me, and I bought her dinner as well because I  met her in a restaurant, so I really got screwed on both accounts. But, you know, when something  like that happens, you're like, you know, I'm going to take this and use it in a positive  way because there ain't no chick that's going to rob me, and then I'm not going to make it 
[03:00:30]  as a result. So she probably has 12 kids and TJ somewhere, and I'm here, you know, with  you guys, so I win. Plug in the Lion's Tale, the book. Around the world in Hispanics, yeah. I was  showing Anthony the picture of when I was the Phoenix.  The Phoenix? Yeah, go in the color insert. I had no gigs going on, and nothing was happening  for me, so I decided I need a gimmick. I need a fancy gimmick. So what I did was I found this  Egyptian mask, and I thought, I'm going to be the Phoenix. So I got this goofy mask, and 
[03:01:00]  then I glued all these feathers on it, and then I went and bought some aluminum poles from  a hardware store and soldered them together in the shape of wings. Then I wrapped a bunch  of spandex around it and got, like, a bunch of sparkly sequins and stuff. And then, like,  I thought, like, this is it. This is going to be my ticket to the big time. So, like,  if you see, like, the picture is, like, the wings are crooked. The mask is, like, not even  pretty. It sucks. You got mangy feathers on there. It's terrible. And I didn't even have 
[03:01:30]  money for straps, so I stapled some spandex straps on to the contraption. Then I go outside  to, like, where I'm going to take pictures, I guess, like, in an open field, like, near a  forest, which apparently is where phoenixes are from. And as I'm ready to take the picture,  the wind starts blowing, and they blow the wings off my back. And then I'm chasing the  freaking wings down the field. It must have looked like a complete ass. Totally. I mean,  it looked like an ass in that picture. I sent that out as promo shots. Book Chris Jericho  as the phoenix. And they just had nothing going on, just grasping at straws. So to finally 
[03:02:00]  continue to take each step to get to where I got to, it was a long process, man, and an  embarrassing one at that. Man, yeah. You're also dressed as a liger. Super liger.  Oh, my God. Super liger. Super liger. There's a guy in Japan who's...  How did you ever make it? How did you ever make it? I ask myself that every day.  I do think that about myself on radio and stuff sometimes.  Sometimes, yeah, you look back or hear some of your old shows and go, what the hell was 
[03:02:30]  I doing? I see a picture of you as the super liger. You want to explain this one?  It can't be a great problem. This is 1997 in, what, Tokyo Dome. Wow. Okay.  Jushin Liger is a legendary guy there. He wears an outfit like that. And it's one of those  things. In Japan, people are very... It's a weird culture because something like liger  is very popular. He has horns and has a very big mask. So they're going to bring me into  New Japan, which is a big company, like the WWE of Japan, to be his evil doppelganger,  the super liger. So I had the same outfit that he had. Now, I've never wrestled in New 
[03:03:00]  Japan. I wrestled in Japan a lot, but I always wanted to go there. I was so excited. And  the first match I had was in the Tokyo Dome. 75,000 people. Huge match. Super liger. It'd  be like being, you know, like, you know, Bulk Hogan, Hogan's evil twin or something.  That level of a star. Bulk Hogan. Yeah, Bulk Hogan. So I show up there. They give me this  costume the night before the show. And it's literally like a hard spandex wetsuit. Like  I can't really move, but I'm like, okay, I'll just do my best. They give me this mask that 
[03:03:30]  the eyes are covered with red mesh. So not only can you not see through the mesh, but  it's red. So you got, you can't see a damn thing. Then the mouth holes are the size of  like a pin. So you can't breathe either and you can't see. So then I go to the Tokyo Dome  and the first thing I noticed is that all the lights above the ring are red. I have red  mesh over my eyes. All I'm seeing is red. It's like a red blur for what I can see. I had  like the stinker. We call them abortions in wrestling. It was an abortion. It was the worst  match ever. The first move I'm supposed to jump on the top rope and do this wacky 
[03:04:00]  kick fall right on my face. Now, when I fell down off the ropes, there's 75,000 Japanese  people. Now they don't say anything when they watch the matches. They study. But when  you fall down off the top rope, they all started laughing. It was like, oh, super ragasuk.  And it's just like, oh my God, this is terrible. And I can't move. And I feel like I'm like  walking in cement and the mask is just a horrible match. Bombed huge. One of the worst, most 
[03:04:30]  embarrassing experiences I've ever had. Go to the back room. I'm supposed to come back  the next month as super lager for a big three week tour. They, as I take the costume off,  they're putting it in a bag.  We're keeping it for safekeeping, please. So that was it. I was done. I bombed huge.  Liger was furious because it was his legacy. And the next month I came back as Jericho because  I'd already been booked, but they didn't want me to be super lager. But that was it. I was losing  everybody. Finally had a match, had a great match, finally. And the boss was this guy called 
[03:05:00]  Choshu. And he was in the back room. And as I walked back, he looked at me. He's like,  oh, you Chris Jericho? I said, yes. He goes, you same, same super lager? Yes. Hmm. Jericho,  good. Super lager, bad. And I say, I think super lager is dead. And he said, yes, I think so.  Good idea. So it was the debut and the retirement of super lager on the same night.  That's hilarious. I mean, God bless you. You're trying all sorts of different things.  Whatever you could do, man. Like I said, make your mark. Well, that's the thing. And you  guys know, being in show business, any form of it, you got to pick up the phone and call 
[03:05:30]  people. No one's going to call you. And LB, excuse me, if you don't think that he's  going to be an actor, look at the front cover of that book. Look at the bottom right thing  where he looks like Barry Bonds. And look at his little skinny body now. Look at his body  him. I want to be a wrestler, bad body. And his fucking fuck wrestling. I'm going to  look good. Well, I'm actually 112 pounds right now. That's actually, uh, Patrice is making  me sound like it just came out of a concentration camp or something. Like you can see that it's 
[03:06:00]  athletic, but you see that picture in the bottom, right? Chris, like, obviously you go back to  wrestling anytime and like the rumors are strong. You're going back there, whatever. If  you don't want to deal with that, it's fine. But what would you like to do? You've done  the band thing. You've done the wrestling thing. Well, I mean, I've, if it was up to  you, you're, you're, you're now an author. Do you want to be an actor? Yeah, I've done  some stuff. I was in a, I was in Android apocalypse. I won the Oscar for best movie  a couple of years. No, it was, I did a couple of movies, which are cool. I mean, I enjoyed  that experience. It's like anything else that you got to, I mean, obviously, unless you're 
[03:06:30]  like the rock and strike it, rock money. Well, and that, and that's a rare thing, you  know, to get that big so quickly, you got to work your way up. And I've done some  stuff. I did a couple of plays last year, which was a lot of fun. I enjoy, I enjoy, I  worked with the groundlings for a year, did, you know, did shows with them, which  is a great comedy troupe. Will Ferrell was a groundling and Phil Hartman, I  think too, they put out a lot of really fucking funny people. Yeah, Lisa Kudrow,  Sherry Terry, Kristen Wiig. So it was great to work with those guys. I mean, writing the  book was great. For me, I needed a break from wrestling, man. I was burned out 
[03:07:00]  mentally after 15 years, wrestling, wrestling, wrestling, wrestling. But the thing is, it's  also wrestling is show business boot camp. You learn a little bit about  everything. It really helps you to train for all types of show business. So I could go  back to wrestling and I would go back to wrestling on my own terms. Have some fun  because it really is an open book. It's an open canvas to go out there and do what  you want to do. Don't make us bring Sam in here. Would you do TNA? Hold on, hold on.  What's going on? Sam, what do you know about Chris Jericho? You mean as far as him  returning? Yeah. Well, he's a huge wrestling fan. The Save Us 2-2-2 promos that have 
[03:07:30]  been running for like a month and a half. A lot of people think that it's got to be the  the turn of Chris Jericho. We've got to call you out a little bit, Chris. Come on.  I think Sam's got one. They're very reminiscent of the Millennium Countdown that counted down  to the last year. Wow. In 1999. Sam, what is the 2-2-2?  Nobody really knows for sure. That's it. We're watching on YouTube right now.  Maybe February 22nd. First time we've ever seen this. Oh, you haven't seen this, huh, Chris? 
[03:08:00]  No, I don't know anything about this. They run these spots on all of their shows.  Wait a minute, Sam. I'm trying to see where this fucking tags into Chris Jericho. It's  exactly like the old ones from back in 1999. But like he said, it might be for some other  dude, computer man. He's a fucking guy. Like, why is this? Why would he bring his  stuff back like that? It's the 2.0 version. That's a gimmick. Computer man. 
[03:08:30]  He has a laptop in the corner. Yeah. Like I said, I would go back to wrestling on my terms.  I wouldn't give up on the stuff I've been doing. You don't want to blow up your big announcement.  I swear. Sam, give us more. Tell us, Sam. This is not convincing. You've got to say  it. Come on, man. Sam's good, though. Sam knows this shit. Make him more uncomfortable.  And stop trying to be coy. Just say what you fucking got to say. Hold on. Move the mic  away from your face. I'm going to study you as, uh, go ahead, Sam. Tell people what you 
[03:09:00]  know. If it's not Chris Jericho's return, then every single internet wrestling fan is going  to be extremely disappointed. Aside from that, on Lance Storm's website, who's another wrestling  friend of Chris Jericho, Lance Storm said that it was Chris Jericho already. Why don't you  throw some bones? You know, all these wrestlers. Here's the thing. I didn't get to know what  he did. You know why? Wait, wait. He just drank the water. He took a nervous sip. He just 
[03:09:30]  took a nervous sip. I'm not a liar. I saw that. He took a fucking nervous sip. He's nervously  sipping water. Oh, damn. Sam. Damn. I don't want to do it. God damn, Sam. You want to kick  his ass? And he's looking at Sam like, oh, of course not. Rusty-haired Negro. The thing is,  I mean, how, how, how great of you. Who is this albino giving away my information? Aborigines. 
[03:10:00]  All the sites listen to us. You might as well do the big announcement right here. I'm not  hiding anything. It's funny. The point is, how good of a deal is this for me to get all  of this free publicity? Because people are getting mad at me now. You were supposed to be back  on Raw last week. You were supposed to do the pay-per-view. I paid my money. It's like, dude,  I never said I was going to be back. And even if I was coming back, I wouldn't say anything.  I'm a magician. You have secrets. You have things you want to do. He is drinking. I think  nowadays, I would took a nervous, I have muscle milk. I'm nervous. If I drink one of  these, it's going to suck. He's drinking muscle milk. It's just for protein. It's nothing. 
[03:10:30]  Of course. Of course. But that's one of those things. I think nowadays people know everything  so quickly. You know, they can go on, on, on the internet and they, everybody finds stuff  out so quickly. When I was a wrestling fan, I didn't know shit. All I knew was what I saw  on TV and that was the magic of it. It was a lot of spoilers and speculation. Yeah, I'm sick  of that shit. I bet you are, Sam. Of course, man. Thanks, Sam. I guess we're not going  to be surprised anymore. But the thing is, everyone thinks they know, but no one really  knows for sure. And that's the way it should be. It's like going to a movie. I haven't seen 
[03:11:00]  Saw 4 yet. I don't want to know what happens. I want to see it as it unfolds on the screen.  This is the political turn. He's good at it. I'm very good at it. Sam's right. He was  dead the whole movie. Sam's probably got more. You son of a bitch. You probably got more  clues. Oh, wait. Sam's got more clues. I was looking through your garbage and you wrote  somebody. So wait till you see this 2-2-2 thing I'm doing. Go ahead, Sam. It's going to fool  everybody. Sam, I don't know anything else. I just know what I read. I don't like spoiling  things either. I like wrestling for the magic of wrestling. For the show business aspect, 
[03:11:30]  right? Sam, hello. It's Vince McMahon. You know, I heard you on the radio today blowing up  our spot. We're trying to keep it sacred and you're being a blabbermouth. I want to  hire you just so I can fire. How? It's not my information. You're fire. Chris, just so you  know a little more, WWE sent him a real belt for his birthday. A champion belt, yeah. The  real one. Really? Why is that? With the spinning thing and everything. Because he's such a huge 
[03:12:00]  fan. Are you sick or are you sick? Make a wish foundation. That's what they did.  Yeah. That's why he's talking so much. He has some little white Negro dementia that  won't allow him to shut the fuck up. He doesn't have much time left. He wants to get it all  out while he can. I feel him. Damn, that nervous sip fucked me up right there. I was rolling  Chris until he took a goddamn sip. Nervous sip. You're like Andrew Dice Clay years ago with 
[03:12:30]  the Fazi gimmick. Damn. We were letting you be, but then I'm just kidding. All right,  enough. No, honestly, I mean, everybody's asking about it. Everyone's talking about it. I've been  doing this book tour for the last week and a half and everybody wants to know. But that's the good  thing about it, man. It's the speculation of it. People are thinking. It's a surprise. It's  anticipation. Stop looking at it now. Trying to look for clues in there. See, everyone, it's like  Paul is dead of wrestling. People are finding clues. Little clues. Like I am the walrus type  of stuff. But you walk out with your book. It's going to be perfect. That's right. Hit 
[03:13:00]  some people over the head with it. Amen. Can you sign Sam's chair? Of course I can. Wow. Is  that from a match? No, that's not from a match. I went to a convention like three years ago  and decided to bring a chair. And since then, I've been bringing it. Getting it signed.  No, seriously. How did you get the belt? And why did they send you a belt? They just sent  it to me because I talk about wrestling on the show all the time. And I think they just  enjoyed the publicity. He was the only one that stood by the gimmick, the Vince getting 
[03:13:30]  blown up in the limo gimmick. Like, we went through the videotape and we're just saying,  like, Sam, look, you can see that. No, no, there's investigators on scene. Like, he was  selling it better than anybody. All right. So he's special. Yes, he's special. That's  where he got the belt. With the fake leg that falls out of the limo and just before it blows  up. Very, yeah, very subtly, but very purposely placed. The leg comes out the  leg goes in. It was hysterical. And then it said the FBI was investigating. But then  when the FBI said, hey, we got nothing to do with this, they came up with what? I think 
[03:14:00]  it was the FIC. The FIC. The Federal Investigation Commission. Center. And the guy that was the  detective, he was like all buffed up and everything. Like, he was one of the guys that wanted to  be a wrestler, but he kind of wasn't up to it yet. That used to always make me laugh.  Like, a wrestler gets hurt in the ring and then the paramedics come out and they're  ripped under their uniforms. And then all the guys got fucking huge arms.  Boy, I wonder what's going to happen with the paramedics in a minute or two here. This 
[03:14:30]  is why you have to love a wrestling fan or wrestling fans that know it is that Vince was going  with that bullshit and then Benoit happened and he just said, this shit's over. And wrestling  since now, it's back. Everybody healed. People didn't go, wait a minute. It's fucking done.  I'm done with wrestling. Oh my God. It's just like, yeah, we know, man. You can't.  Then all of a sudden you had a love child or something.  It was like fucking crazy. That's what I'm saying. It's a form of entertainment that either 
[03:15:00]  you get it or you don't. And people that get it, they understand it. They have fun with  it. But people that don't, I mean, it really is like the stepchild of entertainment, especially  in Hollywood and stuff. They're like, wrestling? What? They're a bunch of Neanderthals.  They can't actually put a sentence together. Every rapper has a movie or every rapper does  a TV show. Heaven forbid that in wrestling you go to these things and people just don't understand  it the same way. Could you not say rapper with so much venom as if you're a DJ?  You rappers. There aren't just people that get it and don't get it. There's people in  between that get lost in this void. If you could find that clip of that young gentleman in 
[03:15:30]  the stands. Oh yeah, we can play that. Can we take a leak first? Do you have to leak,  Chris? No, man. I'm cool. All right. We're going to play the crying wrestling fan. This  guy takes it a little too seriously. After the break, because we've got 10 leaks. We all like  break. Yeah, we like to take leaks together in the bathroom. I like that. Cross swords,  man. That's fun. We can do that now. We're buzzed. We've known each other for years.  We call it the last challenge. What we like doing is lining up at the urinal and holding  the guy's cock to your right. That's right. You just point it. Sometimes you have pissed 
[03:16:00]  on his leg. You just sound like Speewee. The guy imitates you. It's not Jimmy. He's imitating  you. Because I thought he was imitating Jimmy. No, he's going to say that. You hold the  cock to the right. And it wasn't the voice. It wasn't the voice. It was what you said.  Yeah, that's right. And we hold cocks not with hands. We hold them between our upper  lip and nose like funny fake mustaches. You're nestling them. That's not holy. That's nestling.  It's not fun anymore. Jimmy always takes the fun out of the homo breaks. He just made us  feel bad. He makes it so real. He made us feel dirty. I know. It just brings a personal 
[03:16:30]  touch to it that we're not comfortable with. Speaking of personal touch, let's all pee.  All right. Opie and Anthony, Chris Jericho, Patrice O'Neal. And a lot of fans on the  bleachers today. We certainly do. A few girls, too. There's some pretty girls  out there. Yes. One, two, three, five, see four chicks. Hey, anybody work in the crowd  to see if they have anything for the show today? One of these people might have something  for the show today. Chris, you never know. Okay. It'll certainly add more to it than I  did. Oh, the virus is out. Tell your friends. That's right, Opie. Shut your mouth. I love 
[03:17:00]  the homoerotic nature of the whole event. The virus made my genitals rot off. Oh, dude,  don't come near me. We're your celebrity skin cancer connection. And it was better than my  first kiss. Oh, laugh until your inner just spill out on the chair. Anthony's show. 
[03:17:30]  Is that a Chinese thing?  This is one of Chris Jericho's songs right here. Enemy by Fozzie. Are you on, Patrice?  You there? Uh, yeah. Drop something. Chris Jericho in studio. A Lion's Tale. His, uh, his  book, Around the World in Spandex. Uh, Chris Jericho. Yes. Yeah. Around the World in Spandex. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, I didn't see the, Around the World as the Super Liger. But, uh, you're doing a book  signing, Chris? We should get that info out. Does someone have it? Yeah. I don't have  it. All right. I do have it in front of me here. Where are you going to be today? At,  uh, Borders on, um, Broadway. On Broadway. Yeah, right downtown in, uh, in Manhattan  here. 100 Broadway in Manhattan at 1230. Uh, Chris will be signing copies of A Lion's  Tale. Wow. Yes. Until what time? Until they stop coming, right? That's right. That's 
[03:18:30]  right. Until everybody is satisfied. What a soldier you are. We do. Like Jimmy.  Everyone gets it signed. That's right. I have them line up and I sign 10, 12 books and  then I go back to my limousine. Yeah. That would be great. Have a huge line of people  and then just have a security guy put a cone behind the fifth guy. But that's the thing.  It really is like working at a club. Like when you have an autograph signing, sometimes you  show up and there's 600 people there. Sometimes you show up and there's six. You just never  can tell. But if there's six and you got to sit there for two hours, dude, I'm, I'm 
[03:19:00]  writing recipes in their book. Dude, we've, we've been down this road.  Was that origin records? I think we, uh, we, we put out a CD tower back in the day. It's  actually, it's 10 years ago, uh, when we were up in Boston and some of the CD signings  were all day, six to eight hours. No joke. Wow. Yeah. It was crazy. And then we did, uh,  uh, it was tower records, downtown Boston. And the line was maybe 20 people and you just  nailed it. We're sitting there like, so where are you from? Like learning everything about 
[03:19:30]  exactly. Cause you don't want the line to totally die. You're hoping people are going  to get on the back of the line before this guy leaves. That's right. It's like working  at a club. If there's no one in the club, you still want to have a line so that people  think it's happening. You know, when I was in Knoxville, when I first, when I was wrestling  there in 94, they sent us to a furniture store and there was like two first signing and the  guy paid 75 bucks each for me and my partner Lance. So we had to sit there for two  hours no matter what. And there was nobody there, but there was this little group  of kids who were standing around and they're like, we thought you were supposed to be famous  wrestlers. You guys are nobody. There's nobody here. Now go for two hours here and they're 
[03:20:00]  like, shut up kid. Get out of here. The worst is when you sign something and then five minutes  later, the same person comes back through the line. Cause I wanted to know if we could take  a picture of that one. Then you know that you're in trouble. When you start seeing the same  people, then it's kind of rough. Or they know. I was like, I noticed that the line's  really short. So I figured what the hell I'll get some other things signed. Yeah, that's  right. That's right. Yeah. There's nobody here. So I thought I'd just hang out for  a bit. Thanks buddy. I feel bad about ourselves already. Everything to the guy. Yeah, exactly. 
[03:20:30]  Everything. Sure. No, come back here. Grabbing his arm. Hey, come on. So you've been big  fans of the show, huh? Is there any way to be famous without doing this stuff? Like meaning  like you do a movie or you do your book and is there any way to just do this without doing  what he's doing? I seen you on TV. You're here. You got to, you got to promote. You got to promote  it, you know? That's the thing. Especially with something like this book. I mean, it's  your life story and you work so hard on it to get it right. You want to take it to the  streets and it really is a grassroots thing. This is just a lazy man's question because 
[03:21:00]  when I see people do publicity, it's like, right now it's amazing to me that I saw him  on TV and he has the same clothes he was on in Good Morning. I have one suit. And you're  fucking disco dancing with the lady this morning. She was hot. That was the traffic girl  too, by the way. Oh man. And then he's dancing with Jill Nicolini. Yeah, Nicolini. And he's  a nice guy too because he's not a hook of shit because he did the dance and like I'm  never going to be invited on Ellen DeGeneres again because it just, he's doing the thing 
[03:21:30]  and I'm like, you goofy bitch. They were invited on anything again. I'm just wondering is there  any way to just do something and drop it and then they go, hey man, he got a book out and  you just go, fuck all the all day signing. Get out of here. I can sleep. If you're like  A plus on the list, like, you know, 50 cent or Kanye or somebody like that, you probably  don't have to. But when your guys at my level, you know, living on the F list, you got to  do what you can to get out there and make it work. Stephen King probably doesn't have to. 
[03:22:00]  Patrice is looking at me like, come on, man. Stop your bullshit, man. Wrestling fans is like  zillions. You know what else do though? I mean, this sounds kind of really like sucking up,  but I like meeting the fans. It's fun. It's been, I mean, you guys probably have the same thing  because you're on the other side of the mic and the other side of the screen. It's fun to meet up  while some of them are rude. The fucking ones with tits, I like meeting. Don't you notice that  some people are just, some people are just rude and people just don't have manners. Yeah, yeah.  You notice that. They just, they come up and go, listen, I don't watch this shit and I don't 
[03:22:30]  even really know who you are, but will you sign this? Well, gee, thanks. Let me do you a favor  for just sticking it to me. That is the best one. It's like, dude, I don't really listen. I listened a couple times.  I'm really not a big fan. Could you just sign this? Yeah. Go fuck yourself. Exactly. Gee, thanks,  asshole. Yeah. Hey, I want to hear. I don't even know if I should talk to you anymore. Your dad was  a Ranger? Yes, he was. I didn't even know that until today, man. Yes, he was. Were you a hockey  player growing up? Yeah, I just wasn't very good, but, but I grew up actually with a son. Was he Ron 
[03:23:00]  Duguay? A little bit earlier than that. He played for the Rangers from 70 to 75. And I used to remember  sitting in the garden when I was about three and I was really mad because my dad would never look  up and wave at me when he was playing his games. And I thought, come on, dad. And he's fighting  Dave Schultz or whatever. And I'm like, dad, dad. Was he a fighter? Oh, yeah. Oh, geez.  Look at his nose. Oh, yeah. Wait, who was your dad? His bridge of his nose is in his ear. His name  was Ted Irvin. I didn't know that. Oh, Jesus. But not only that, but he also scored, too. He used 
[03:23:30]  to get 20 goals a year. He was like one of the original power forwards. Had he come around 10 years  later, he would have made millions. Are you a fan of any other sport? Uh, not, no. Water  polo. But no basketball? No. See, I want to know. Basketball? Yes. Like, you're a basketball  fan, right? I'm a sports fan. Yeah, absolutely. I guess I'm trying to find out on, in sports  terms of, like, say, basketball, football, was your father Peyton Manning or was he a, like,  a lineman? He was, no, no, no. He wasn't Peyton Manning. I'm trying to put it. How many years  did he play? He played 10 years. Oh, that's a, that's a career right there. What's the dude's 
[03:24:00]  name? Um, what's, what's, uh, Rondae's brother? Tiki Barber? Oh, not, not at that level, but  kind of someone that's that. He's like Rondae. He's Rondae. Rondae. People know the name  and, you know, kind of a great player, but not a superstar. But if you're a hockey fan,  you know your father. Whenever I come to New York, man, people still ask me, how's your  father doing? You go to the garden, it's the same security guards, you know, ushers. I  remember your father, Teddy Irvin, and it's like, how old are you, man? He's like 90? But  it was the early 70s, but people in this, in this city, in New York City, are the, like, 
[03:24:30]  they're such loyal sports fans. It's amazing. They remember everything about my dad and about  my career and everything in between. I'm an Islander fan, so. I don't know if it's worse,  like. We're supposed to hate you guys. I don't know if it's worse not knowing your father,  which I didn't, or having this, please daddy, love me, often disappointed face that he had.  Like, this is my dad, but my dad's paying me no fucking attention. Or is it better just  to be alone like shit? I don't have nobody to relate to, so I'm going to just look at 
[03:25:00]  this camera. Who my daddy? Who my fucking father? Are you my daddy? Daddy? Daddy? I don't  give a fuck. I'm going to play basketball, but this face of, oh, the constant pain on this  face. The years of toil. I've used that anger to fuel me to this day. I'm going to show you,  dad. I'm going to go in a basement of an old man and be beat to death every day. I'll teach  you a lesson. My pain is your pain. I actually played in a celebrity. Christopher Reeve used  to have a celebrity game at the garden. I played four years with it. It was great, 
[03:25:30]  but the one year I asked my dad. Oh, Jimmy. My dad can come. Don't fuck around with Chris.  He was a good dude, man. Yeah, why would I? I can see your wheels spinning. Not at all.  And you all blink off. Oh, terrible. What? Oh, my God. I think you can't. Terrible.  Everybody's going in. You know what? Christopher Reeve in a wheelchair could still kick your  ass. Not a big deal. Good for him. It was a great answer. I thought you were supposed  to be a comedian. That wasn't funny. But anyways, I have a story about it, you jackass. Don't 
[03:26:00]  interrupt my story. I can't even tell the story now. It's been built up so much. He's really  mad at me. Well, it's good. He was a friend of mine. You don't talk shit about someone's  friend like that. Yeah, well, that's true, but he was a very famous guy, and we poke fun  at it. You know, we do it. It's not that it's nice, but we do it. Ladies and gentlemen,  Jimmy gets his ass kicked. O.N.A. Right after these words. O.P. and Anthony, the hosts of  the show, your bosses. Yes. Are being respectful. Bosses. And you got across the line when I  said, don't say it. Well, I wasn't being disrespectful. Yes, you were. I was very disrespectful. 
[03:26:30]  You didn't say you were friends with him. I'll be honest with you. I was this close to being  disrespectful, but Jimmy jumped on it first. But you didn't say, first of all, you didn't  say you were friends with him. You just said you played in a tournament with him. I'm  just kidding with you, man. I was actually going to go with the, I could see your wheels  spinning when he said that. I was going to go on that. Oh, see, I threw you a softball.  See, I was going to go on that part. I would love to see him put Jimmy in some type of finishing  hole. You know what it is? Jimmy can bend at least three times. Here's the finishing 
[03:27:00]  hole, Patrice. That's it. That's the finish. That hole crown. Not punching him, because Jimmy  doesn't have any bones in his face. That whole crowd out there would have stood up  if you hit Jimmy and said, leave him alone. Please don't do that. Nobody would have helped  me. Of course not. We're not going to do that. No, no, no, no. You really are, but it's  okay. I didn't know he was a friend. My fury is over. I'm happy. I'm happy. We love each  other. And I am a comedian. You didn't think it, because it wasn't a funny line, but I am 
[03:27:30]  one. Okay. Now he feels bad. I was laughing at the awkwardness. Oh, let's shake hands on  air. There you go. Your hands are shaking fine. We're buddies here. They're okay now. That  was a little awkward. That was. You know, it was awkward. But it was beautifully awkward,  though. You got to stick up for your buds, right? I mean, that's just the way it is.  Not really. Not these guys. Not these guys. We're all scumbags. We're all scumbags. We're all  scumbags. We're a bunch of heathens in here. You should go down to the county cell and  see how these guys treat each other. We're brutal. It's amazing. We're just a bunch of  scumbags. It is amazing. We're just a bunch of scumbags. That's what we are. We fucking, 
[03:28:00]  nothing is sacred. We just kind of took this conversation and took it to a screeching halt,  didn't we? No, no, no. This is beautiful. How was your cough when you peed?  Screeching halt. Much like, no. Did you hold each other's cough when you peed? Patricia's  holding mine. It felt really nice. It's so funny to see guys change the subject. Let me tell you  something. Let me explain something about the word inappropriate, and men should not  fucking exist. Only, look, you make, you go out there, you make, you might make a mistake  where it's like it's personal to you, and I understand, but it's like to inappropriate, 
[03:28:30]  you can't have it. The only time you should be inappropriate, the word used by a man, is  like you ever had to shit, you feel like you had to shit, but you just had to pee, and you're  sitting down with your fucking dick tucked between your legs, feeling like a girl, and you're  just looking around going, you know, I feel like a bitch.  But this is inappropriate. Other than that, you should be able to, because we were talking  about earlier, it's context. You gotta try a Christopher Reeve joke, even though, it's just, 
[03:29:00]  I understand what you're saying, but you gotta, I gotta stick up with Jimmy on this one, just  because this is what we do, and it, it fell flat, and it was awful.  Yeah, but if you're gonna bomb, but it's not a joke. If you're gonna throw one out, you gotta  throw a good one. Because it's a friend, Jimmy didn't know it was a friend of his.  No, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, wait a minute, you gotta throw out a good one, that wasn't  a bad one off the cuff, it wasn't that vicious even, it was, I didn't realize it was a friend  of yours, but it was like, it wasn't that vicious, it was like. Let's play some tape  with some real vicious shit. Yeah, but I'm saying, but it wasn't done. Let's get vicious. 
[03:29:30]  You know, it was just done in the moment, and he was a very famous guy, I mean, it was,  you know. I didn't mean that, asshole, don't find it.  Look at this fucking asshole right here. Hey, we're still waiting for. He loves this,  he's not saying. He's got a big smile. Look at him, he's like a godfather.  You're talking about, you're talking about, like right now, going, hey, you know, it takes  a million years for the energy of the sun deep down to come out. Enough of this. As Jimmy's 
[03:30:00]  getting ready to get raped by Chris Jericho. And I will rape him. I will sodomize him.  Oh, he's sitting there. Look at how his fingers are together.  Well, well, well. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. They've turned on each other.  Let the animals tear each other apart. You were talking about the nervous sip from the  water glass. That says much more right there. It was an amazing moment. It was. Oh, ingenious.  Well, that will make the best of show. There's other things involved with that. That's what 
[03:30:30]  makes it amazing. So like what? Excellent. That's great. Fucking sitting there, loving  it. It just, it just, ah, whatever. What's the matter? No, something I was going to bring  up, which ties everything in, your, your mom's a quadriplegic. That's right. So that's why  he's a little sad. How funny do you think you are now, motherfucker? Wow. Now you feel  bad, don't you? I told you not to cross the line. No, but I talk about suicide. My friends  have committed suicide. It's like as a subject, you look at something like that. You don't  ever want to, but that was something that obviously hit you hard for that reason. But 
[03:31:00]  you can't, you can't look at me like I'm being a dick on purpose because I'm not. This  is very, hits very close to home, obviously. So when you went there, I was like, wow, this  is going to be interesting. That's all I'm saying. Let me tell you. My father's a quadriplegic  too. Well, he's, he's been dead for a few years. His limbs don't fucking work. But that's  funny. That's funny. That's funny. That's bullshit. You're mad at me. That's not bullshit.  It is. It wasn't very funny. I'm not offended as, as, as, as a guy who had delivered. I'm offended  as, as a comedian. That was just a bad joke. A third annual blink off was not fucking 
[03:31:30]  bad. Look at Anthony's killing. I respect his opinion. And that's what made it weird  because I'm laughing because I thought that was funny. It was funny. It's just the third  annual blink off. And what was funny about it? It's the word blink. And a blink off will  never happen. And I got Patrice and Anthony to laugh at that. Guys, this conversation is  just going nowhere. I know. You know, if you want me to continue to participate, we know  the story now. Let's just move along and have some fun and talk about cocks and stuff. 
[03:32:00]  Oh shit. Oh no. We've reached this point. Oh my God. Listen to the silence. I will close  this part of my, if had you said to me, look, this is my situation. I shouldn't have to.  There's certain things that just aren't funny. See, okay. Well then, to me, to me, I'm not  a mind reader. So if you told me that, I would have certainly been. I said, don't cross  the line. How much more do you? I said, don't say it. I can see your wheel spinning. We were  already in the middle of it. Had you set it up like that, I'm just telling you it would have  been different. Yeah. How much sugar in those muscle milks? Zero. My mother's diabetic. 
[03:32:30]  Zero. I don't want that fucking sugar. Man, people listening to this show are just getting  burnt. They're getting a buzzkill. They want to have some fun on this. Chris, they're fucking  vultures, man. Our audience are fucking vultures. Look at his smiling, grinning faces. He doesn't  like me. I know he doesn't like me. I know he's a jock. He wants to punch me. That's what  they do. I get it. Oh, no, no, no. I get it. I'm smart. I go and wire your car so when  you get downstairs. I don't have a car. Do you have a car? Yeah, no. Just wire clubs  out of Kenny. He's stupid. Wire him ticks. Oh, good. All right. I got to do a couple of 
[03:33:00]  the crap. All right. I hope he punches you in the mouth so they get some type of meat to  him. So they swell up. Like it's some Botox instead of those thin bird lips you have now.  You just never know what's going to happen on OA. Just punch him in places. Punch him  in his arms so it gets muscular. But dude, I'm not mad at you anymore. I'm over it. But  your feelings are hurt. I can tell. You're not a good psychologist. My feelings are not 
[03:33:30]  hurt. No, I'm not. But you've got a different look on your face now, though. I'm not going  to be phony about it. Don't be phony. Don't be defensive. Just move on. Jimmy can hold a  grudge like Simon Wiesenthal. I'm only irritated that he said like Simon Wiesenthal. I was  telling him I was being respectful. Had I known that situation, I would have been respectful  of it. I really would have been for anybody. But what he's saying, but I told you not to  like, that's what's bugging me is he's like, hey, I instructed you not to and you should  have known. And you should have just followed his instructions. He told you. Now fucking 
[03:34:00]  shut up. So now you want to continue this? Now you're bugged now? No, you're asking me  why am I playing? No, I'm telling you we're over it, man. You want to continue arguing about  it and disrupt the show or anything? Because I'll argue all day if you want. You just said  to me, I was done with it and you just said to me, now my feelings are hurt. I'm explaining that  they're not hurt. Okay, well then it's over. It's cool. Tell us some jokes. Give us some  wacky material. Oh no. Okay. Oh no. Oh no. You can't say that because I would almost take  the beating to get the laugh I would get. See? Oh no. Oh, this is killed. It's nothing, 
[03:34:30]  but this is not uncomfortable. It's hilarious right now. This is good radio. But human beings,  this is what I'm saying, every human being should really enjoy this because this is as real as  you. Can you imagine this? This is reality radio. It is so real right now and it's like  if this was on that shitty morning show of Julian and Sandy, it's just like, okay. That's 
[03:35:00]  how we ended up when it gets like, okay. Yeah, well, so. But look at Opie, leaning back,  hands behind his head. But my thing is, Jimmy, there's no reason to continue on with this.  You're continuing. I'm not continuing. Sure you are. I'm done. You said to me my feelings  were hurt. I was saying that you were wrong. They really weren't. Okay. That was why I had  that and I explained it. It was not a winning thing. Okay. Well, your feelings aren't hurt.  We're both bothered by something. We move on. But let's go. Yeah, there's no bothering  anymore. I'm done. We're done. It's fun times. Good times. I'm done. Good days. Good days. 
[03:35:30]  Fun times. I'm done. Holy shit, man. Wow. You just never know. Live radio, man. It's compelling.  You gotta love it. It's like the 50s. It's like the old Hollywood, man. Dean Martin. It's only  10.34. Shit. I was hoping it would be 11. This is crazy. That whole thing was like  a minute. And we can't move on. How does it happen? What do we do? This is the great  thing is, oh shit, here we go. Oh, Paul. What are you doing? This is a lot. You gotta explain 
[03:36:00]  it, Patrice. The security guards just walked into the studio. Here's the great thing about  this. This is the journey that's going to be great is finding out how to move on.  An out. Especially with the heavies behind us now. Now, let me ask you a question. The  raised ink on the bottom of the book. On the cover, yes. It's red. It's raised. That's  cold. It's cold. It's embossed. Embossed. It's embossed. And that's a special kind of printing  process. Yes, it is. It was invented in 1965 by Albert Jones. Bring Red Rum in. Red Rum's  going to get naked to try to calm everyone down. Naked? We did notice that nudity does solve 
[03:36:30]  the world's problems. That breaks the ice. We're going to attempt. That does. If there  was nudity at peace conferences, here we go. Oh, she has double piercings. Actually,  a triple piercing that we can see. Is that an explanation for her breath? Wow. Wow, there  you go. There we go. And that was just on command. The power of ONA just come in and get naked. 
[03:37:00]  You have recovered beautifully, by the way, from having a baby. You look fantastic. Oh, she  just had a kid? Yes. That's good to throw that in to really sexy it up, Jim. No, but  I'm saying, I'm complimenting her. She looks beautiful. What's with this guy? What's  the matter, Jim? What? Bring up that she has a baby. We're all looking at her real nice.  You got to bring up that she's got a baby? What's the matter with you? Everybody knows  she does. What the fuck is the matter with you? Now your fucking feelings are hurt. Why  are you on my case today, man? What the fuck? She looks good. What is going on? I can't  even be nice. What the fuck is going on, Jim? I'm telling her that she looks 
[03:37:30]  very sexy. Everybody knows she had a baby, so I'm saying she knows. Well, you didn't  know, but she knows. And he knows. Now you know, and I know, and everybody knows. McGarrity  knows it. And the thing is, when a woman has a baby, nothing, every woman is self-conscious  about her body. And I'm telling her, she looks fantastic. And I told her that before.  He's sociopathically, on a sociopathic level, focused. And he is like this, a nasty little 
[03:38:00]  man. He will not stop. What's it going to take? I'm not in a nasty mood. How far are you  going to go? The cobra clutch. Did I not tell you before that you look good? But you're using  her awful after-birth titties to make a point about the six of women's children. We know  what you're doing. I don't like what he just did, which is use this excuse to get that mean  titty joke in. Who do you think your bitches did? I didn't know she had a baby. I thought 
[03:38:30]  they were awful titties alone. He just claimed you. He set you up. He used us. He set you  up. You used us to get a mean titty joke. I feel like we're minutes away from a royal  rumble. Call more security. Help us. You know what? Don't insult Chris Jericho. I hear  Jimmy Norton got his feelings hurt. Is that what happened? Don't insult Chris Jericho. Leave  the studio master. Everybody, there's no, that's silly. What the fuck? That's kind of an insult 
[03:39:00]  to be quite honest. Oh, that the security came in? Is that why he came in? Yes! Oh,  come on, man. First of all, I'd be in big trouble before Poe got there, but it was not  necessary. Dude, come on. Chris Jericho's a professional. Come on, guys. And he's rich.  And he knows that the lawsuits... Believe me. I have no dignity problem saying that I would  be fucking... Oh, would that be great on YouTube? How funny would that be on YouTube? You pounding 
[03:39:30]  Jimmy in the face. And just him suing Chris Jericho! They do it in slow motion 20 times. It  would look like when Smith got hit in the Matrix. Your fucking cheek would just go in. Tell  your jokes now, funny boy! Norton National Wrestling, isn't it? The NNW, as he owns Heavy  Hits. He sues Chris Jericho! That's why the security came in. I just figured that out. Thank  you, Chris. No, I don't have a pot to visit or a window to throw without him. You're fired! Thanks 
[03:40:00]  to you! This is... Because we used to do... On Tough Ground, we would get into these... We all would do it. I watched  it. We would just be like, you mother... And have this quiet, you cocksucker. Did you  just... You know? And then it's like, alright, I'm gonna fucking do this to you. And then  I'm gonna do this to... It's just uncomfortable. This is... It's just... That's what we do.  It's just uncomfortable. It's just... I want it to continue. And it's just... After a while  it just gets old. But you just wanna just have this go on and on. This is a memorable show. 
[03:40:30]  And have logic on. Of course. And what's wrong with Red Rum's tits? They look like... Oh, no. I think she  looks great, man. For real. It's... No, they... Look. They look fine. I'd fuck her. I would... I mean,  it's not like my... I'm not... I'm just saying... Now she's mad. Yeah. Hey, look. And the crowd is  getting mad that everyone's turning on. And the psycho she's married to? Is he gonna be angry? 
[03:41:00]  You know, Opie is funny. Oh, he's a psycho? Let me see. Oh, he certainly is. Yeah, which one? This guy?  That guy's insane. He just looks crazy. Look at the size of that guy. He looks like the guy  that beat up fucking Linderman. I think she's hot. And he don't look like he got enough money  to sue. That's your bike. Mike. Here's the thing. This is the thing. Now, here's where  I think it's unfair in life for this. It's like, okay, I don't wanna know all the context  before... I mean, I don't wanna know the whole story before I make a titty joke. And I don't  wanna hear the whole story. You don't have to hear the whole fucking story till you go, 
[03:41:30]  I'm gonna try to make this funny. So she pulls out a little tits, and he just...  They just look like little scared things. And you just... I gotta comment on them. Without  having to fucking go, I have to now be a man with whatever. If my girl pulled out a fucking...  She had stretch marks on her ass, you know what I mean? And come in and go, Jesus, ass  looks like a road map. I don't want her to go, look at my big nigger boyfriend who's  gonna fight you. I don't wanna deal with that. But that's what he'd be thinking. I am focused  on the titty. I'm not getting into, oh, sorry, now I have to go deeper. 
[03:42:00]  into your past, like, you know, my family, I come from a family of baggy little titties.  And then I gotta hear his story. But you know how many niggas are killed? I don't wanna  hear that shit. What happened to our fun show? It's still fun! It's still fun, Chris. You  know, the best thing is, Opie, you're saying sometimes it's a grind. Like, this show, you  will remember this show. Oh, this isn't a grind today. No. This show will be remembered.  It's nothing personal. Well, that's what happens with comedy, though. It's okay until, like,  a joke gets too close to home. We talk about that on the show all the time. There's things,  you know, we joke about that personally I don't like, but I just, I sit here in silence 
[03:42:30]  and deal. That's comedy. Very broad. I learned this in college. This is all I learned in college.  Yeah. Good is good if it's good for me. Everybody's upset with what affects them.  Exactly. That is the general definition of comedy right there. You're fine with stuff  until it hits too close to home. Right. Shit. My mother can lose all her feet. But  you think I don't fuck around with diabetics? It just is what it is. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I think you're a rare, you know, a rare... You're a rare human.  Not for a comic he's not, though. I mean, as a comic, that's the way comedians think.  Nothing personal, precious. You don't have to have your murderous husband murder me.  Look at me. I shaved all my hair off and I'm gonna kill you. Don't forget.  I wanna... It's nothing personal, precious. Why no...  You could have been spectacular naked. Hold on. Why no panties, though?  I never wear underwear. It's freezing out today, though.  But how come you just... Wow. That must...  How come you came in and got naked on cue? Is this something... Do you do this quite often?  Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'm pal talk. Perfect. So she's the... In case of uncomfortable situation, 
[03:43:30]  break glass, she comes in and gets naked and everybody's cool again.  Dude. Dude. Dude.  You know what I'm saying? Dude. Come on, dude. Dude.  Like, that's the thing. Like, how would I... It's impossible to figure out.  She comes in and will strip naked in front of people she don't know.  And... But there is a psychopath with her to guard her against certain things. 
[03:44:00]  Rape.  But not the idea that I...  Right. Rape, but not...  You can't... It's impossible. You can't do it.  You can't fucking do it.  That's why everything is on...  You can joke about every fucking thing.  Everything.  And then you deal with the consequences later.  And motherfuckers don't deal with consequences in terms of being funny.  Dude, I got kicked in the mouth.  Chased home with knives for being funny.  And go, shit, I'm gonna be funny tomorrow. 
[03:44:30]  Motherfucker couldn't stab funny out of me.  You sure that was for being funny?  Or trying to be.  That's why I dropped that blonde girl off.  I told a joke and her father chased me.  Nah, that wasn't it.  It's just you have to go for it, baby.  You got to.  And Chris, this is not uncomfortable.  It really ain't.  This is a new thing.  This is the new thing.  And you got to...  And you was a heel for so long.  Dude, I'm cool with it.  I'm just discussing her breasts. 
[03:45:00]  That's what I was just curious about.  Right.  Those are fun.  But they're fun.  I like them.  See, now I want to get into a wrestling match with Chris.  Those breasts aren't fun.  In what game?  They're fun.  They're perky.  They got nipple rings.  There has to be a context to that.  They got nipple rings in them.  That's cool.  And the context is this.  I would...  In a minute.  But you just...  If it was my girl, I would go...  I would just go,  Hey, what's going on?  They just...  Because I got a deep up hand. 
[03:45:30]  But you just said...  You just said good...  Yeah.  You just said good is good if it's good for me.  Yes.  That's what it is.  That's good for me.  It's good.  Really?  Yes, I like it.  I like her.  Yeah, my hands are different.  I would have to kind of...  I would have to squeeze those and suck them through the fists.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  He's surprised he came out with that one.  And it's not even on her.  It's just... 
[03:46:00]  But the thing is, too, though...  The thing is, too, if she's going to come in and get naked, you have to deal with the consequences.  People are going to make comments.  So, I mean, it's not an insult.  You're commenting.  But she understands that.  I'm not insulting.  She understands that.  What do you think you're a brass?  I don't like them.  Well, I do like them.  I like the leg cuts.  No, they're getting bigger this year.  No, they're getting bigger this year.  And that's smart.  And get them just to fill in the space.  He's a big ball guy.  He promised me boobies.  Yeah, you should get them.  And after today, he's going to feel so bad, he's going to definitely get you boobies.  Don't go too big, though.  I know.  Just fill in the space. 
[03:46:30]  That's all you do.  Whatever that...  You know what I'm saying?  Don't...  Just fill in.  Squeeze him in his face.  You know, like a balloon.  Like a water balloon.  And then twist it.  Fucking off.  You are awful, man.  You are just an awful man.  That was a good one.  Yeah, that was a doozy.  That was a good one.  Wanna play a crying wrestling fan?  Yeah!  Oh, there we go.  Good segue.  That's nice.  That's what we were going to do before break. 
[03:47:00]  Or just after break.  Yeah, we've been waiting for that.  Oh, it's how it turns.  It was just a love fest and then...  Instantly.  Now we're trying to repair the damage.  Let's all join together in laughing at somebody retarded.  Let's see where this goes.  Because I'm sure that this gentleman you will hear from is not of sound mental state.  It's a famous clip.  Do you know this clip by Chris?  I'm not sure. 
[03:47:30]  I don't know if...  Were we looking over here?  Yeah, here we go.  Let's play this.  On E-bombs world.  Let's get the sound.  Go.  Please.  For the love of God, just play something.  Where's the sound?  Play it!  Each and every one of y'all.  For all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, dammit!  I'll be...  Make it easy, man.  Make it easy, man.  Thank y'all guys.  Y'all were awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these. 
[03:48:00]  That's not real.  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever seen that?  No!  That is legendary.  That's real?  He's a little upset about the whole wrestling thing.  That's like the Britney guy.  Britney, why?  Yeah.  That's...  Oh my gosh.  He's a little upset.  But of course, he's right in the south.  I think this ain't real blood.  It's the same type of attitude.  What needs to be said?  Thank you so much.  I don't know what he was so upset about.  He's, uh...  There you go.  Who are the wrestlers?  It's Jim Cornette in the middle. 
[03:48:30]  Looks like Terry Funk.  Hmm.  Bobby Eaton.  Wow.  Do you have the...  Sam's nodding his head in agreement.  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Chris Jericho's right.  He's correct.  Yes.  Thank you.  That's for your home personal use, isn't it?  Right.  The way you're videotaping.  Well, there'll be like a few clips online.  You can invite your little friends over for like a WrestleMania.  I don't have to.  And then go, by the way, before WrestleMania, I just want to show you a few of my home movies. 
[03:49:00]  You might enjoy Chris Jericho.  And then you'll play that and your friends will be like, wow, you're neato.  No, I'm not eight.  The rusty...  What did you call him, Patrice?  The rusty-haired...  What did you say?  The rusty-headed white little negro.  The rusty-headed little negro.  Poor Sam.  Oh.  Sam was related to Thomas Jefferson.  And he's true.  He looked up his genealogy.  Wow.  And we all know Thomas Jefferson did partake in a little...  A lot of the Jefferson part. 
[03:49:30]  It's true.  Kind of went out into the...  You sure it wasn't Joyce Jefferson?  Sherman Hesley fucked his mom in the back of the building.  That's funny.  No, that didn't happen.  Oh, okay.  We were waiting for an answer.  All right.  Do you want to ask Chris Jericho a question?  Wow, yeah.  Yeah.  Does it make you feel good to know that after, like, being gone for two years that there's  this much hype about just a possible comeback than knowing that you still have?  No.  It wouldn't make anyone feel good to know that they're wanted or appreciated in what they 
[03:50:00]  do.  I hate it.  Oh.  You're fired.  You're fired from the Than and Sam show for such a stupid question.  Go ahead.  Ask him another question.  Ask him another stupid question.  What kind of ambiguous question was that question?  Dude.  First of all, it started as a yes or no question.  Right.  Do you think it's like yes or no?  No matter what.  What a fucking shitty question. 
[03:50:30]  And then as you went into it, you took no out of the mix.  All he could say was yes.  Yes.  Ask him how big he's packing.  Something interesting like wow.  Try again.  Sam.  That's interesting.  Try again.  All right.  Who has the biggest monster in the business in terms of you just go, what the fuck?  There's a guy called Too Cold Scorpio.  Too Cold Scorpio's packing the monster wood?  Radiator hose.  That's fucking figures.  Ridiculous.  That's fucking figures.  Ridiculous.  Who is he?  He just is a funny looking black dude and funny looking black dudes just got a monster 
[03:51:00]  wood, man.  Baby arm.  Yeah.  Baby's arm holding an apple.  Holy shit.  Too Cold fucking Scorpio.  That's why he did that move.  He flipped.  Yeah.  He just would have something protecting him.  Whack.  He looking right on his balls.  Blah.  Yeah.  The momentum from the unit take him right over.  Exactly.  That's all right.  My balls get me from dying, nigga.  Gotcha.  Um.  Okay.  When I was a child, I saw something.  Go ahead.  Last week.  Would you ever allow Ralphus to return? 
[03:51:30]  Ralphus was my weird sidekick guy that he used to drive the truck around, drive the lights  and he had like no front teeth and had these spike incisors that stuck out of the side  of his teeth like punji sticks from Vietnam.  And I dressed him in a half shirt that said Jericho personal security.  And he was just this weird guy that used to just come to the ring with me as kind of  a funny thing.  He still alive?  Still alive?  I don't know where he is, man.  He started, he got weird.  He was like just a truck driver and the next thing you know the girls were talking to him  and people were chanting for him. 
[03:52:00]  I'd be getting like really big heat with the crowd.  Like, you know, you suck and then turn around and people would be cheering because Ralph  was on the other side like waving at the crowd.  And I said, you can't wave at the crowd.  We're bad guys.  But these guys, they're nice people.  They're cheering for me.  They're very friendly.  You hate them.  No, no, no.  They're really nice.  This guy just didn't get it.  So I think, I don't really know what happened to him, but he was literally a truck driver  one week.  The next week he was on TV and everyone was chanting his name.  And I really don't think he really understood what was going on.  Like he was banging broads in his truck outside of the arena. 
[03:52:30]  He would be taking flowers from girls like at ringside.  Like people just went nuts for him.  Time of his life.  Exactly.  I don't know what happened.  But I don't know what happened now.  So I guess the answer is no.  No.  Another yes.  He had to make something interesting.  I'm doing the best I guess.  Why don't you ask him what hair care products he uses?  Because his hair looks lovely.  Two hours we've been here and that's the best you got.  Give me something better man.  Not even two hours we've been here.  You're a fucking wrestling fan.  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Years.  All the stuff that's went down today.  Fun stuff.  Heavy stuff.  Everything in between.  And you ask me, do you like your fans?  If I had asked Patrice's penis question I would have been considered a gay guy.  No.  Just I'm saying.  Just so.  I don't know.  Sam.  Thank you for your question Sam.  I appreciate it.  Just ask a goddamn question that somebody wants to goddamn hear.  Like if they would ask, if they were here, you ask a question for them to do.  After your question five people turned up their radios to get the answer.  That's five people though. 
[03:53:30]  That's pretty good.  That's wonderful.  We're talking to a million.  Nothing.  Let's go.  Give him another one.  Last chance.  Ask him something interesting about your favorite wrestler that you want to know about.  Well, he is one of my favorite wrestlers.  So then ask him a favorite wrestler question.  Let's.  How about.  Poor Sam man.  Not a fucking.  Not a newborn infant question.  This is like a three year old.  Mr. Derrico.  He has to be fake with you right now.  You're making him sick.  Oh no. 
[03:54:00]  Sam.  Am I making you sick?  He's not going to say that because he knows that he's a good guy.  You ask me anything you want bro.  See what I'm saying?  Here's your last question.  And Patrice is right by the way.  Think about this Sam.  Think that a lot of wrestling message boards.  You know.  No matter what we do.  If we mention wrestling.  The boards get slammed.  Now they.  Of course with everything that's been said and stuff today.  There's going to be a lot of information on Chris Jericho on the message boards.  Congratulations.  You have the opportunity now to make a. 
[03:54:30]  Ask him a question.  That's going to end up on all these boards.  You'll be kind of like a wrestling board celebrity.  Oh wow.  But it's got to be a good question.  Yeah.  Why is that a pressure question?  I don't understand.  What the hell is the matter with you?  Did you feel slighted when I.  When you were kind of.  Pushed out of the main event scene towards the end.  I mean.  Right at the end.  Wow.  Horrible.  Wow.  You were pushed into middle cards.  How did it make your life feel shit?  Yeah.  Yikes.  That's what he was saving up for. 
[03:55:00]  Wow.  I'm saying I thought that you should have been the main event.  When you're on the road to has-been-dom.  Yeah.  Was it really rough to.  Next stop's real life.  He's making the main event now.  Yeah.  And it's just the same question he asked.  Except for now it's uncomfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, do you enjoy when you do the moon saw?  Yes, I do.  Do you enjoy when you would bump down to middle card and wrestling right before the guy who  dressed up with the green lantern?  Do you like cake? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  How do you feel to wrestle?  Yes.  How do you feel to wrestle without the TV cameras on?  How do you feel to be in the high school gymnasium?  How did it feel to wrestle on the Allentown wrestling tour?  When you went from main event to jobber before the cameras came by.  The guy who just looked like the green lantern.  Oh shit.  When you started being gang grills.  Did it bother you when all you-  Did it bother you?  Gang grills.  Oh god, did he suck?  When they made you gang grills.  When they made you put in vampire TV.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit. 
[03:56:00]  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  How did he suck when they made you put in vampire teeth with gang grills.  Here's a literal Vince story.  You're talking about Vince firing people.  Here's a Vince story.  Gang grills was a vampire guy for people that don't know.  And he had one of the coolest ring entrances, right?  He would come up from the bottom, fire, and he looked cool.  He had something that guy.  But just wrestling wise, it just wasn't there.  But he wore a shirt.  And they kind of didn't know about it anyways.  And he was wrestling and he took a bump.  And when he took a bump, his shirt came up. 
[03:56:30]  And I was sitting right by Vince.  Vince was watching the show.  And this big roll of flab came out of the shirt.  And Vince looked at it and went, ugh.  The next week, fired.  Fired.  You wanna eat like a pig?  You can live with them.  You're fired.  That's right.  Pack your stuff and get out.  You and your fat roll.  Oi!  Agh. 
[03:57:00]  Agh.  I can just picture that.  Agh.  Agh.  Agh.  That's disgusting.  You wanna represent me?  Get up!  I can't believe what a fucking mediocre nobody Sam is right now.  Just nothing.  Just stinking up the joint with these fucking questions.  Nothing!  He's got time to think now.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Just picture all the websites that are gonna have this question later today.  And then Sam asks. 
[03:57:30]  And then Sam asks.  This is great.  This is great.  Let's go.  Politically, what was it like between the differences between the WCW locker room and the WWE locker room?  Bigger cops.  Bigger cops.  That's a good question.  That's not a bad question at all.  See, there you go.  After five tries, you got one.  That's a good question.  That was a good question.  WCW was very strange.  It was very much a hierarchy.  Wherever you came in is where you stayed.  Like an Indian cast system or something along those lines.  So all the guys like the Hogan and those guys, they were kind of running the show.  And guys like myself, even though we were working hard and people were into it, 
[03:58:00]  didn't ever really get any care or respect from the office.  And that's the reason why I was able to kind of get over a little bit because nobody cared what I said.  Can I go say a promo for 30 seconds?  Yes, you can.  I'd go to the ring, say a promo, say a bunch of bullshit.  People would like it.  But no one was paying any attention to me because I was just lowly Chris Jericho.  So the politics, it's almost like they had everything but really squandered it.  It was like a millionaire who spends all his money on hookers and blow and then says,  I didn't put any way for the future.  That was WCW.  When I went to WWE, it was a whole new world. 
[03:58:30]  Everybody had an angle.  Everyone had respect.  Vince McMahon knows the name of the popcorn vendor all the way up to the world champion.  Eric Bischoff never really said anything and would kind of really be sequestered off with his guys.  It was a real high school.  Everybody sat with themselves.  It was strange.  Is Bischoff still there?  In WWE?  No, he's not.  No, I don't think he's there.  He's gone.  He's gone, yeah.  He's gone.  Coach and all these guys that are being put over as GMs and da-da-da,  is there any of them that actually make matches or like Teddy Long or anything? 
[03:59:00]  No, it's all show.  It's all show.  Yeah, it's all show.  And you should know that, Patrice.  I know that, but they do.  Like Jim Ross, when I was there, Jim Ross was a big boy.  Yeah.  Jim Ross was like-  He was the head of talent relations.  He was a big boy.  Really?  All he was on tape was the guy with the-  The announcer or whatever.  Yeah, he was like, what do you understand?  Exactly.  Oh my God, King.  Amazing.  That's what he-  But he was a big-  My God!  My God!  I tell you a guy that was an asshole when I was there, who treated me like shit, 
[03:59:30]  was the other big boy.  It was Vince and there was another motherfucker who was really the man.  Dog the Bounty Hunter?  Dog the Bounty Hunter.  And he looked at Vince when I was on the plane and went, what the fuck is this nigga doing  on the plane?  Don't let him on the plane, I like saying nigga!  Who was it?  The pilot.  Kevin Dunn.  Kevin Dunn.  Kevin Dunn.  God, he treated me like dog shit, Kevin Dunn.  Well, he's the executive producer of all the shows, so yeah, if he was treating you 
[04:00:00]  like shit, you don't have long to last there.  It was just awful.  He looked me up and he wouldn't even speak to me.  I'm like, Jesus, I'm right next to Vince.  Wow.  Yeah, he's big time.  Good job for...  That was good.  He finally got it.  Yeah, he got it.  Should we do line of the day and get the hell out of here or what?  That sounds like a plan.  Sounds good.  We were still trying to recover from the atrocities.  I think we made a full recovery.  We did.  We're doing good.  I think so.  Yeah.  We're doing good.  It's all good.  I think we're okay.  I think this is crazy.  Are you guys going to agree to disagree? 
[04:00:30]  Is that what it comes down to?  No, we're friends.  Agree to disagree?  Where's the...  Oh, God.  What does that even mean?  Agree to disagree?  Yeah.  It's a bit we do on the show, Patrice.  Of course it means nothing.  That's the point of the whole fucking thing.  I know.  We just hate when people say that, so now we do it on our show.  Oh, my God.  Look at how they usher the audience out.  I disagree.  The audience is leaving in protest.  Oh.  They usher them out so we don't have to sit here and take pictures with all of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Ask questions and they can take sides on our arguments. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, shit.  No, we just don't want them to see the bloodshed.  No witnesses.  They won't see me.  They'll just see, like, one of my shoes and my bloody sweatshirt.  Take it out.  The best part is that security was sent in.  That wasn't necessary.  It's like, come on.  It wasn't necessary.  Who makes that call?  Do you have a red button underneath Poe?  No.  It was a judge.  Was it you?  A personal judgment call.  No, believe me.  No, who fucking did that?  Poe would hear that go.  He actually told Poe not to come in here.  And he said, no, no, no, I'm going to come in here.  Poe was doing his job.  Oh, man. 
[04:01:30]  That was unnecessary.  I guarantee that was just Poe coming in to make sure.  It's my job.  That's great, though.  I mean, now we can say, remember that time when the security came in?  It was so crazy.  Poe was trying to protect me.  He didn't know if Chris was just going to smash me.  Oh, come on, man.  We're professionals, right?  I'm saying that that's what his job is.  Chris, when did you take this?  When did you take this?  I don't think he'd punch you.  I'm not saying he would, but.  Ellen?  I thought that was Chris Jericho right there.  I'm sorry about that.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's not a joke on you.  It's a joke on Ellen.  You're trying to fucking make a situation motherfucker.  No, no, no.  Not him.  You think he looks like Ellen Morris? 
[04:02:00]  It was a jerk on Ellen.  It's a joke on Ellen.  I don't have to say if you're saying I look like Ellen the Jericho.  No.  You just said you look like Ellen the Jericho.  Did he just say I look like Ellen the Jericho?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he fucking did.  He goes, when did you take this?  We all looked up and there's Ellen the Jericho on TV.  Dude, if we were watching King Kong and someone said, look, it's Patrice.  You'd go, oh, that's the joke on King Kong.  I'm just trying to.  No, that seems great.  A contest we can all appreciate. 
[04:02:30]  I apologize.  I'm Mrs. Right.  Very fair.  That's what I'm just trying to be.  What were you getting at, though?  Was that it?  He said I'm skinny.  He said I'm a lesbian.  Earlier he said I looked like I was from a concentration camp.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  It wasn't me going to Ellen, but going to Ellen.  Hey, listen.  Are you coming back to wrestling with that tutu thing?  Right.  I couldn't say anything to her.  So it was like I was saying that to her, but he was.  Ugh. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah.  I'm so lost.  So I have to.  That makes sense.  Man.  Yeah.  And I see your side.  I can't hear you go to Ellen, but he's saying that the punchline was Ellen, not Chris.  Yes.  If Ellen was sitting here and Chris was on TV and you go, hey, look, then it would have  worked.  Absolutely.  And that's where it went.  Yes.  But then we also wouldn't have had that earlier situation if it was Ellen.  It would have been a lesbian thing.  It would have been a lesbian thing.  I've completely forgotten.  Yes.  Jimmy would have blurted out some insensitive lesbian joke.  Of course. 
[04:03:30]  And she'd have kicked his ass.  Absolutely.  God damn it.  Boy, this has just been a lesbian.  This is the wild west.  It has, hasn't it?  It's just been a lesbian.  It has.  We've run the gamut.  Take your fucking hat and go to the cotton club, you motherfucker.  I know.  You see it?  Come back.  He's just like the American gangster, dude.  Yes.  Trust the bitch around and do it.  We're not leaving until we see that brother Joseph has proper medical attention.  I'm going somewhere to get a cock-a-lean right now, baby. 
[04:04:00]  Robson.  That's an amazing hat.  It's got a feather in it.  It works.  All right, Patrice.  We learned today that Chris Jericho is coming back to the WWE.  Let's not forget that.  And...  Ooh, he did not deny that.  Well, I mean, at this point, what's the point?  Wrestling sites have fun.  What's the point?  Exactly.  Why bother?  So it's a yes?  Well, you know.  I got a book tour for the next month and after that we'll see what happens.  We just beat him down.  That's going to... 
[04:04:30]  You know something, though?  At this point, he's like, oh, fuck it all.  That right there is going to scoop your great questions on the wrestling websites.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  But that's the speculation that's going on.  And I never denied or confirmed anything.  It usually means it's true, by the way.  Well, you know.  Alliance, you know, to get my truck.  Sorry.  Let's make it perfectly clear.  Chris Jericho's book is Alliance Tale Around the World in Spandex.  Getting great reviews from someone I respect a lot as far as writing goes.  Mick Foley. 
[04:05:00]  He's written some great books over the years and he writes thoughtful, thorough, and laugh  out loud funny.  Jericho's book is a winner.  And he was kind of scared that your book was funnier than his.  Well, like I said, that's the idea.  Hopefully we'll get that.  You know, come on down to...  Where am I at?  Borders?  100 Broadway in Manhattan at 1230.  You'll be there signing copies.  Come on down and insult me.  It's Insult Jericho Day.  Wow.  Are you coming back, Ever?  Jimmy's going to be dropping in for that one.  To hear...  Guys, this is fun stuff.  Yeah, it is. 
[04:05:30]  I have no problems.  I had a great time.  You know, sometimes you get into deep discussions.  This is what we do.  You know what I mean?  Jimmy, I mean, talk, brother.  Come on.  We had a deep discussion today.  Everyone has opinions.  Yes.  There's no lasting...  No, no.  Not at all.  The Mets or the Knicks?  The Mets or the Knicks?  Yeah.  Do you like basketball or baseball?  Basketball players playing baseball.  It's perfect.  Sounds like an idea.  Yes, and I'll be in Queensborough tonight at the Saratoga Comedy Club in that shithouse  Sweet Basil restaurant.  So come see me there. 
[04:06:00]  And hopefully...  That's enticing.  Come see me in the shithouse.  Hopefully you'll be funny.  Let's hope so.  To be a first.  But if you can make it, come on.  Be up there.  Saturday, early show is sold out.  So try the other three.  Wow.  732-545-HA-HA tonight and tomorrow night.  Two shows tonight with that revolting phone number and two shows tomorrow night.  The great Patrice O'Neal.  And of course, Chris is doing his book signing today at Borders 100 Broadway.  And there's going to be a line, so get there early.  You do Best Week Ever still? 
[04:06:30]  Not Best Week Ever, but we just filmed I Love the New Millennium.  And even though it's only 2007, they're already doing that.  Oh, okay.  I want to thank Quick from Harlem Nights also.  I am going to wear this hat, man.  I knew it, but it's going to happen.  I'm just going to wear my goddamn hat.  No, we learned when you wore that fucking Pink Panther shirt.  And we didn't give you any shit about it.  Right now, Oscar Madison's head is cold.  This guy came in with a Pink Panther t-shirt one day.  And we didn't give him one fucking word about it. 
[04:07:00]  Not one word.  We let him slide for whatever reason.  You know some sneaky bastards.  You know a lot of little quick from...  That is a fucking amazing reference right there.  You know something?  I wish I could sit here and take credit for that.  And there's the bell that starts the third round.  I wish I could take credit for that, but that was handed to me by Danny.  Danny.  Oh, Danny did.  Who came up with it?  Was it Danny?  Danny Googled blacks and hats.  See, that's good.  Thank you.  That's funny. 
[04:07:30]  That's the true comedy.  These fucking two.  Oh, these two.  We're going.  We're going.  Chris is a goddamn troublemaker too.  Chris is, of course.  He thinks he's slick because he's smarter than probably 98% of all the wrestlers.  They don't know when he's being an asshole.  But the thing he knows that's jabbing him is his validation of each joke.  Now, that was good.  And then I'll say something.  Chris is fully aware of what he's done.  That's all you are.  For the people out there.  This thing is still going on.  You just got to listen very closely. 
[04:08:00]  We'll have to bring the rematch back.  You got to hear the little jabs that have been going back and forth the last three minutes.  Hold on.  The great Khali doesn't know when he's doing that tour.  No, Jimmy.  Don't let Patrice stir you up, man.  No, no.  Patrice is right.  Of course.  I'm not stupid.  I don't know.  He likes that one.  He's fucking 40 years old.  He just did the bottle thing.  Let it be said that Jim's been jamming back, too.  You just got to listen really closely.  Of course.  But of course, I know that that's just what it is. 
[04:08:30]  So then if I'm like kind of shitty about something, he'll go, what?  We let it go.  What an ass!  Do you know what he is?  He's a passive-aggressive monster.  He's a passive-aggressive monster.  He's a passive-aggressive monster.  He's a guy who can fight who's passive-aggressive in his ass!  I almost made it at the door  until you figured it out on air.  I liked this show.  We were fully aware.  We just wanted it to play out  because it was fun to listen to.  At one point,  at one point,  Chris went,  now that's funny.  And Jimmy goes, 
[04:09:00]  yeah, thanks.  And makes the face like,  but it sounded like a thank you.  But if you looked at the face,  it was just like,  yeah, thank you.  You can't be able to fight  and be smarmy.  You can't be a smarmy ass  and beat somebody up  at the same time.  You have to just,  that's not telling somebody,  I want a smarmy ass.  And you love it, don't you?  You love it.  But that's why Chris Jericho's shit is great.  I love it.  Oh, that's amazing, dude.  I love when he used to do all that stuff  during his matches and all that crap.  But that's the equivalent 
[04:09:30]  of telling somebody the truth.  That is fucking genius, man.  Telling somebody the awful truth.  Like if someone has an ugly girlfriend,  they go,  hey, your girlfriend's a pig,  and then winking him  and poking him in the stomach.  I gotcha.  Just kidding, man.  Good call, man.  That's right.  Just kidding.  That's very good.  Between us, you know,  it's very good.  And I was just sitting there going,  why is he?  And I go, oh my God,  Jericho's a goddamn troublemaker.  I was feeling bad for a second.  Like, nah.  No, he absolutely is.  I'm like, he's an asshole, man.  That's hilarious.  He knows.  Mm-mm-mm.  Manipulation is my game. 
[04:10:00]  Holy shit.  He's been doing that his whole career.  That's what we do.  I know wrestling's hated you.  There's only like three that liked you.  I already know.  I just know.  Son of a bitch.  I'm going to pee my pants.  Do we have to do line of the day?  All right, it's funny.  All right, bowdogfantasy.net brings you line of the day.  It's for fantasy football fans everywhere.  Bowdogfantasy.net.  Check it out for yourself if you play some of that fantasy football.  Bowdogfantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Hart said that his client is not a racist 
[04:10:30]  and vowed never to use the word again.  Well, how is he going to go through life without saying again?  That's good.  Did you just say that's good?  No.  Thanks.  That's funny, guys.  Dear diary.  You guys should do more humor like that. 
[04:11:00]  That's nice.  I want to hang out with Chris Jericho more, man.  He's right down my alley there.  He's funny, but I didn't realize he was that funny.  I didn't realize that.  God damn it.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Good is good if it's good for me.  Yes.  That's what it is.  That's good for me.  It's good.  Yes, I like it.  Yeah, my hands are different.  I would have to kind of squeeze those  and suck them through the fist.  Jesus Christ. 
[04:11:30]  That was a good one, man.  Now that was a good one.  That was funny.  If you adopt that,  that is going to be the worst.  That's worse than a car crash to go.  Now that was a good one.  I wasn't feeling your niggership,  but that was good.  Oh, holy shit.  Oh, how the fuck is that?  It all comes crashing down.  Unbelievable.  I haven't heard a lot of your stuff, Patrice,  but that was really funny. 
[04:12:00]  I'm not a fan or anything.  You should do more of that right there.  Do a lot more of that.  That's a good one.  Do a lot more of that right there.  All right, hey,  here's another runner-up line of the day.  I'll be playing Pose Revenge.  It's set on a video game of FH Riley's.  No, not.  No.  Poe in the parking lot.  Oh, yes.  I want to make it very clear.  You have to walk through the establishment first.  We don't build that activity at that fine restaurant.  Then you go out back.  Pose Revenge is he ties you to a stake  and then talks to you.  Oh, shit. 
[04:12:30]  Swim walk.  Oh, shit.  Is this bad?  I just texted Poe to get my car and face it west.  I said, make sure it's facing west.  Do you think that's going to be a problem?  Yeah, he's got his stupid finger up in the air.  Poe, where is it?  It's in the Park of Meridian lobby.  Is Chris texting wrestling friends here?  Yeah, I have.  No, my wife just called me because I haven't called her a morning.  What'd she call you? 
[04:13:00]  She called me an idiot.  She called me not funny.  All right, here we go.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Just so you know a little more,  WWE sent him a real belt for his birthday.  A champion belt, yeah.  The real one.  Really?  Why is that?  With the spinning thing and everything.  Because he's such a huge fan.  Are you sick?  I keep talking about that.  I keep sick.  That's a great line.  That's all right.  Now, that one's good.  Now, I don't like it.  That plays off of sick children.  Because that's what they...  That is what they send sick kids.  Oh, my God.  Honestly, I'm still going at it. 
[04:13:30]  But I'm not.  I'm saying the truth.  What is he sick?  They send sick kids shit.  Oh, shit.  They really do.  That's a play off of children.  Can I say to you...  I believe it.  I can't fucking...  I got the line of the day.  No, the problem is that I got the line of the day  and I'm not even a comedian.  It's not line of the day.  Oh, shit.  Can I show you the face?  I know it's radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, play it out for everybody.  But he would not...  When that happened, when Norm just did that,  Chris's face went down as to go...  It went like a computer to go, 
[04:14:00]  how am I going to get him back?  He is competitive.  Of course.  He is awful.  Dude, you should be like that.  You're actually right.  That's what I was thinking.  He just went...  All right, good one, motherfucker.  But I can't say that.  To come back.  Holy shit.  This is one of my favorite fucking radio shows of all time.  I found out Chris Jericho is just horrendous.  And Norton is just pure... 
[04:14:30]  His whole body is a heart.  I know he's shaped like a...  He's shaped like an inside of a body, like an organ.  He's shaped like a liver.  But he's all heart.  This is better than the main event at WrestleMania.  Oh, yeah.  This has been going on for the last hour,  the little jabs ever since the moment.  Well, the main event at WrestleMania,  but not his main event,  because he's on the middle cards, right?  Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember Sam.  I remember Sam.  Sam, no!  Hey, fucking...  Yeah, that's right.  Fucking dress, sock, eyebrow,  jilch.  I worked in a battle royal on WrestleMania once. 
[04:15:00]  Sam wanted to ask this question.  Is it true that you had to write a book  because the WWE doesn't care about you anymore  and you don't need something to do?  What are you, motherfucker?  What are you, this is?  Why is this going on?  And by the way, there's fucking Opie's beauty.  I want to say something awful,  so I'll pretend so-and-so wanted to say something.  We're alerting the rules of comedy.  And look, Anthony's looking at him like,  hey, cuntface.  Wait a minute.  I did not.  Anthony's not looking at him like that.  This is the meanest show I've been on forever. 
[04:15:30]  This really is mean.  You're pretty much watching a show  just unravel in front of your eyes.  This is so mean.  A show we've built up for years  is coming apart today.  Jimmy's fucking pigged that right on the head, too.  Using somebody else.  Well, because I think Jimmy's been waiting  to get back at me  because I kind of, like,  jumped in on the Jericho thing earlier.  I think he's been waiting to give me a slam.  I just noticed it.  Jimmy has been pretending to be him  since that happened.  He's been a doppelganger of Jimmy. 
[04:16:00]  Like, he has went into another place.  Oh, my God.  But Chris is still there also,  but he's less, he's more political.  Jimmy's just, his little eyes with no eyelids  are just open.  And Chris is like,  ha, ha, ha,  I want to get this little piece of garbage.  All right.  We got to get Jericho out of here.  A lion's tail around the world in spandex.  But here is your line of the day.  Thank you, BodogFantasy.net.  Uh-oh. 
[04:16:30]  Here's...  Here comes...  Let's see who I hope this stuff.  Uh-oh.  Let's see who he's just fired.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Duck and cover.  And then you got, in second place,  manliest video games ever,  according to arthurstfall.com,  Mike Tyson's Punch-Out from 1987.  I remember that one.  That's a classic.  Yeah, that's a classic, obviously.  Yeah, I agree.  Tyson's Revenge.  The Custos could have been the same. 
[04:17:00]  Did I get line of the day?  Yeah.  Nice try, kid.  Tracks!  We learned the staff has no balls whatsoever.  No, no.  Wait, everybody leaned up like this.  Bunch of pussies.  Come on, guys.  They should absolutely fucking just made it  the most uncomfortable situation.  I actually jockeyed my chair towards the door.  He's nervous.  Jordan was back here with it.  You know what, though?  I had nothing to do with it,  and I was watching for my escape around. 
[04:17:30]  We all were looking.  All right, I think I can jump over this console.  I think he can get out in two seconds.  Hey, Chris, it was a pleasure.  I hope you come back.  I don't think you'll ever be back.  What's wrong with Steve?  He doesn't do what he normally does here.  He's sitting in those chairs.  You can't sit in those chairs.  I thought he was thinking deeply.  No.  I'm going to pee my pants.  I hate for this one in there, Ovi.  I think we did everything.  Unless you want to keep going.  I got to go.  Everyone's got to go.  We're out of here.  A Lion's Tale.  A great book.  Crip Jericho. 
[04:18:00]  Signing 100 Broadway in Manhattan at 1230 today.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see you Monday.  Thanks, man.  Hi.  My mom always tells me when bad things happen, I need to find a happy place.  Like when my Uncle Henry crawls in bed with me and kisses my neck and licks my ear, I think of Obi and Anthony.  That's my most happy place.  It's Obi and Anthony! </pre>
