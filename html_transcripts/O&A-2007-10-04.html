<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between segments.  It began with a "Phone Call Thursday" segment featuring listener calls, many unrelated.  A Perv News story about a woman raped after meeting a man online in NYC sparked a discussion about online dating safety and the dangers of meeting strangers from the internet, specifically mentioning the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  Opie's purported "sports curse" regarding his MLB playoff predictions was also a recurring theme.  The hosts extensively discussed the potential cancellation of their show in Chicago and Pittsburgh, lamenting the difficulties of their comedy talk radio format.  A caller's birthday was acknowledged, alongside a fun fact about Ramsey condoms.  A significant portion focused on vasectomies, prompted by a listener’s question to Anthony, including graphic descriptions and reactions to a YouTube video.  They addressed criticism from Cleveland's "The Maxwell Show," mocking the hosts' "good morning" greeting and their weight.  A playful argument over the word "douchebag" and FCC regulations concluded this segment.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing critique of "The Maxwell Show" and its host, along with comedian Dan Stansberry, repeatedly referred to with derogatory terms.  Audio clips from the Maxwell Show were played and dissected, mocking Stansberry's style, catchphrases ("and punt"), persona, and crew members' names.  The hosts challenged Stansberry to a comedy battle, offering to play a comedy set on their show.  Boxing promoter Don King called in, leading to a discussion about an upcoming Madison Square Garden fight, his career, his manslaughter conviction, and boxing legends.

Don King later appeared as a guest in studio, alongside Otto, Jim Norton, and Eric McMahon.  They discussed the boxing event at Madison Square Garden, detailing the fighters and their nationalities.  King shared anecdotes about his career, including his time in Zaire with Mobutu Sese Seko. The conversation touched on the hosts’ three-year anniversary on XM radio, Jim Norton's book "Happy Endings," and various personal anecdotes.  The Iron Sheik also called in.  A "What Did We Learn Today?" segment concluded this portion, featuring humorous listener takeaways.

The show extensively celebrated its three-year anniversary on XM,  with discussions on Rich Voss having another child later in life, aging, and listener anecdotes.  Audio of a former XM employee, Bruce Kelly, emotionally recounting seeing The Who perform was played and mocked. The hosts revisited the story of a listener’s girlfriend's "cum breath."  Opie's "sports curse" resurfaced after predicting a Phillies loss. A listener shared a creepy rest stop encounter, leading to graphic discussions about sexual acts among the hosts and guests. A lengthy, explicit audio clip of "Drill Dough" was played. Eric Logan called, congratulating the hosts and requesting Yankee playoff tickets. A listener recalled Bernie Goetz's agitated appearance on the show.  More listener stories, often graphic and sexual in nature, were shared. The hosts promoted upcoming shows and the excerpt ended with more "Drill Dough" and a brief, rambling call from Bernie Goetz. Chuck Liddell also made a brief congratulatory call.

A segment featured listener calls recounting humorous and shocking anecdotes, including mustard attacks, used power tools as gifts, a reference to *Fargo*'s wood chipper scene, and an argument between Opie and Anthony.  Callers shared impressions of the hosts and personalities, using vulgar language. Recurring show bits ("drill diva," "donkey sausage," "Edmund Fitzgerald") and inside jokes were referenced.  "Half a Hulk" called to discuss his upcoming surgery, prompting insensitive banter from the hosts. E-Rock's absence from a planned "E-Rocktober" show was a source of frustration. The hosts promoted upcoming live shows.  The segment contained extensive profanity and offensive language.

The broadcast concluded with an angry exchange between Opie and a caller, involving insults and profanity relating to truck drivers, drugs, and incest. The conversation devolved into name-calling and boasts about sexual exploits.  A request for the "Tony Danza" bit followed, featuring Anthony impersonating Danza in a sexually suggestive phone call with a listener, ending uncomfortably.  A brief mention of "Guitar Father" by Anthony's brother Joe, followed by a guitar solo, preceded the playing of sexually explicit voicemails from Pat O'Brien for Betsy.  The segment was abruptly cut short, concluding with comments from the hosts and producers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put 380 in my chest and a full charge.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick, freaks! 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like transvestite...  Or transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says,  pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, time to wake up. 
[00:01:30]  That's right.  Rise and shine, porcupine.  Get out of bed, sleepy head. 
[00:02:00]  I think we can do better with the rhymes than that.  Let's see.  I'd be honest with you.  Wake up, you runts.  Wake up, you runts, all you.  There you go.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Ah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this fine phone call Thursday.  Oh, I forgot. 
[00:02:30]  Well, the listeners haven't.  Maybe if I just take to it and accept it finally,  people will just go, ah, look, Anthony's accepting it.  And then kind of not do it anymore.  Phone call Thursday is stupid.  I dub it stupid.  You're just playing right into it, though, sir.  I know.  The phones are lit because of you.  The more upset I get about it, the more people want to do it.  I believe if you accept it, it'll go away in two to three weeks.  Two to three weeks?  You sound like I have a disease. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, well, accept it, it'll go away in two to three weeks.  I'm the radio doctor.  Two or three weeks.  It's also Perv News Thursday.  Hopefully we have a good one today.  We've gotten more happy Perv News than the first couple of tragic Perv Newses that we've  gotten, which I'm happy about.  It's kind of horrifying when it ends in a child death or something.  Well, I got a Perv News.  Where the hell was it?  I was just reading it. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah, really fast, really fast.  Personal story or something you read?  No, I'm reading this.  I understand people are meeting others online.  I understand that.  Oh, Opie, so many great relationships have started online.  You got a lot of dating sites.  You got a lot of people just tooling around online trying to find a little something something.  I understand that's happening out there, but this is what I don't understand.  There was an online rape.  A 21-year-old, just ring the bell when you realize what's wrong with this story. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  A 21-year-old Indianapolis woman.  That's all right, you know.  She's from Indianapolis.  She's going to be trouble.  She's 21.  She took a bus to New York.  Come on.  So far, all right.  New York's a big place.  Every movie you see, that ends badly.  New York's a big place.  Yeah.  A 21-year-old Indianapolis woman took a bus to New York to see a man she met online. 
[00:04:30]  She was raped repeatedly in his queen's apartment yesterday.  That isn't his picture on the news, is it?  Huh?  Oh, I think it might be.  They're showing the Port Authority.  Well, that's the...  Showing the Port...  Uh-oh, that guy looked like...  Looked like bad news.  Well, that's the point I'm trying to get to here.  The woman waited in the Port Authority bus terminal Tuesday.  It's a classy joint.  ...before alleged attacker David Graham, 32, showed up.  So she's 21 from Indianapolis. 
[00:05:00]  She comes to New York, and she waits at the Port Authority bus terminal...  Yeah.  ...for the guy she wanted to meet from online.  You don't want to go there if you need a bus.  Right.  That's how bad that place is.  That place is really bad.  Oh, they'll tell you, you know, we're improving it and making all sorts of changes.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, we got more cops, blah, blah, blah.  We got a Ralph Cramden statue in front that makes it look fun.  Right.  You don't even want to walk by the place.  Just walk by the place.  Stop right there.  You don't even want to walk by the place when you're across the street from the Port Authority. 
[00:05:30]  A lot of bums congregating.  Bums.  I would almost understand.  21-year-old girl comes to New York to meet a guy she met online, and she was waiting  in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.  Yeah.  I would almost understand that.  For Richard Gere to come in and sweep her off her feet.  You always got to figure out your odds and things, but this is a bad one.  She maybe should have Googled Port Authority.  Right.  Assuming she's going to find a fine catch at the Port Authority bus terminal is a little questionable. 
[00:06:00]  I'm very surprised.  Why didn't you just give us a dress and have her meet in there?  Yeah, exactly.  That's a problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's red flags all over the place.  So then Graham took her to his apartment that we just saw on the news, which just looks horrific.  That should have been another sign.  You should have just opened the door and did a tuck and roll at 30 miles an hour.  And, well, he raped and sodomized her.  Ah, the old sodomy comes into play again. 
[00:06:30]  She managed to escape to her neighbor's apartment yesterday morning and called cops.  Graham, a convicted...  Escape to a neighbor's apartment where she was again raped.  Well...  By the neighbor.  Ah, Graham, a convicted sex offender faces charges of rape, sexual misconduct, and criminal  misconduct.  Whew.  What a dummy.  That's what I'm getting at.  I'm reading this going, what were you thinking?  I don't know how many really successful internet relationships get conjured up.  It just seems very seedy, the whole internet. 
[00:07:00]  Well, the dating sites are getting a little more respectability.  What, the legit ones, like, or semi-legit, whatever, as legit as you can be?  What are they, like, match and the other ones?  Our old pal Jay met his now wife through a dating site.  Really?  Yeah.  Those are way legit now.  I figured, if I was a single guy looking for a girl on the internet, I wouldn't even go  to a legitimate, like, eHarmony or match or anything. 
[00:07:30]  I would probably go to, like, some kind of sleazy thing like Jimmy used to do back in  the day.  What, to find a potential girlfriend or just to get some action?  Not hookers, just to, like, go out and if something happens at the end of the night,  it happens, but, like, I don't know.  Wait, wait, you're confusing me, though.  Are you looking for someone that you want to spend, like, quality time with?  Are you looking for lust or love or a little of both?  Well, you don't know until you meet the person. 
[00:08:00]  You don't think there's, like, women on match.com that'll get the job done for you?  No, I think they're looking more for a relationship right off the bat.  So if I wasn't looking for a relationship, I'm just looking, like, to hang out and check  out, like, real chicks that just kind of want to hang out also.  Maybe something is made of it.  Maybe it's just sex.  You know, who knows?  I don't think you're getting that from an eHarmony or match because, you know, they tell you  you've got to fill out 80,000 different things about your personality. 
[00:08:30]  Who cares?  I have something here that needs tending to.  That's pretty much it.  I think there's a lot of goers on the legitimate dating stuff.  Unlike match and stuff and those, yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  The commercials don't make it look that way.  Of course not.  I met my soulmate.  Well, did you see the new commercial?  Is it for match.com where they're basically saying it's okay to look?  Yeah, yeah.  Because they want more traffic to their websites?  Yeah.  They're basically saying, hey. 
[00:09:00]  Even if you're in a relationship.  Right.  You're just looking, right?  Wink, wink.  Fine to look.  That's how they're getting the word out to, like, married people.  Like, yeah, you're just looking.  It's okay to look.  Match.com.  I think it's match.com.  I'm giving them a big plug today.  I'm watching these commercials going, really?  Isn't that cheating?  I see what's going on here.  They're encouraging cheating.  Why don't you just say it?  You're pretty much going into a bar or a club and meeting someone and getting to know  them a little bit, only online. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Only it's an online thing.  You're getting to know a lot about a person.  And then what happens?  A correspondent starts online.  Hey, I read your profile.  I'm into that, too.  This is great.  And then before you know it, oops.  Yeah.  You're out the door.  Well, there you go.  The perv news for today.  I mean, that's just crazy.  And if she didn't know about New York City, as soon as she pulls up to the Port Authority  bus terminal.  Actually, I'm assuming she probably took the bus right into the joint.  Oh.  As soon as you get off that bus, you realize, oh, this is not a good idea. 
[00:10:00]  And you should have got right back on the bus.  Love in the exhaust fumes.  That's what she thought she was going to find.  You know, there's a guy that helps with security.  I don't want to blow up his spot.  His job, when he's not helping us, I've mentioned a couple times on the show, this is how bad  the Port Authority is.  He has a shift at the Port Authority bus terminal to catch guys having sex in the men's room.  In the men's room, yeah.  Even with a cop that's patrolling the area, it's still a problem.  A cop, you idiot.  That's how bad this place is infested with, like, creeps. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, jeez.  Sounds like a 1930s cotton club with all the feet tapping in there in the bathroom.  They're tapping away.  Tap, tap, tap.  Shuffle ball change.  So I guess we got perv news out of the way.  Maybe we'll try to find a good perv news today.  Of course, it's Fun Fact Thursday.  And of course, I'm an idiot.  I forgot the old sweatpants.  I'm an idiot.  Oh, you're dead? 
[00:11:00]  No tent from Opie today.  Well, Than finally looks at me and goes, do you really want us to remind you?  I'm like, yeah, because we've got to get this bit out of the way.  And he did.  No, no, no.  In an email, he goes, I will remind you.  I will call you in the morning.  I'm like, yeah, you have to, because now we've got to just get the bit done.  Opie's a fan.  Yeah, could you wear your sweatpants today?  Yeah.  Because, you know, it's kind of pup tense. 
[00:11:30]  By the way, we did.  The lunatic is on the grass already.  Oh.  Got to linger longer.  Yeah, come on.  All right.  And, hey, so far, I'm doing very well in the Major League Baseball playoffs there.  I'm doing very well.  What happened?  I picked the Red Sox.  Go, Sox, go.  Yes, you did.  They beat the Angels for a zip.  All right.  All right.  I picked the Phillies.  Yes.  But that's my main team.  It is. 
[00:12:00]  Everyone knows I'm going Phillies all the way.  Of course.  They lost to the Rockies 4-2.  And people are screaming at me on instant feedback.  Oh, Jesus.  Sergeant G from Iraq.  Opie, the Phillies are a lock.  That was my quote.  The great Opie sports curse continues.  Colorado 4-2.  Phillies 2.  Oh, God.  Chris in Boston.  Hey, Opie, congratulations on getting your sports curse off to a good start.  Good job jinxing the Phillies.  Oh.  And he's in Boston.  He's not a Red Sox fan.  He's like, can you pick the Red Sox?  I did pick the Red Sox as well. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  But Phillies, your team.  And I also picked the Cubs.  Go Cubbies.  Well, they lost to the Diamondbacks 3-1.  So, I'm doing pretty well.  One out of three is not bad for me.  I don't think your heart's really into the Sox right now.  Not until, you know, probably the next round when they play the Yankees.  No, I want the Red Sox.  Yeah?  I want the Red Sox to win the American League.  All the way?  And I want the Phillies to win the National League. 
[00:13:00]  You want the Phillies pretty much to go all the way.  I'm picking the Phillies to go all the way.  All the way.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, glad to hear it.  And hopefully we'll still be on in Chicago so we can, like, talk to Chicago about their  Cubbies.  Yes.  All sorts of rumors flying that we might be off the air in Chicago.  Now, who knows?  They registered fresh.  A fresh?  One of the fresh stations?  Supposedly they registered fresh up there in Chicago.  Oh, boy. 
[00:13:30]  I don't think we fit into a fresh.  Well, we are.  We say, like, fresh things.  Oh, we're fresh.  Maybe it means that.  How great would that be?  Fresh.  Fresh radio with Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning.  Welcome to fresh.  Good morning.  You look really fat in that dress.  That's fresh.  You're being fresh.  Because they're freaking running the fresh commercials here in New York City.  It's like, it's, let's call it what it is.  It's light FM.  Yeah.  But they're trying to make it sound like it's cool light music. 
[00:14:00]  Something new and fresh.  See, I thought that was a black station when I heard fresh.  I never heard, because fresh is like a, you know.  Like funky fresh.  Yeah, I did.  I didn't even listen to the station.  No.  Fresh is taking off here in New York, and they're trying to make it sound like it's like, it's,  it's light music for cool people.  It's the same crap.  Yeah, it really isn't.  Their logo just seems easier on the eyes.  That's all I could figure.  Hey, I could see your panties sticking out of the top of your pants.  Oh, you're being fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  You're Celine Dion. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, fresh, huh?  They registered that up there?  Got a message to Shirley.  Your husband's cheating on you.  Oh, you're being so fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  Here's Barbra Streisand.  Yes.  Yuck.  So, I don't know.  I don't know what's going on in Chicago.  You don't think that they would keep this show on the air if it was like a light FM station  type thing? 
[00:15:00]  A fresh?  Yeah, maybe this would be the right mix.  I don't know.  I think we'd have to find a fresh station to be at.  Yeah, we're going to have to find a fresh station.  A fresh station.  We're looking for fresh stations in a few cities at this point.  At least format changes.  Jesus.  Yeah, we lost our Detroit affiliate.  They went all sports.  It's just the...  I don't know about that whole talk thing.  We lost Detroit this week, and we lost... 
[00:15:30]  And this is a big disappointment.  We lost Pittsburgh.  They're playing Christmas music, and they're teasing that there's going to be a new format  by Friday.  And a lot of our Pittsburgh listeners, every day on instant feedback, hoping that we're  going to be part of the new format.  Yeah.  We're not going to be.  Don't keep those hopes alive.  Enjoy the Christmas music for a couple more days.  Yeah.  Then whatever they throw in the air.  Whatever slappy and whappy and music format they go to, have fun.  The talk format is very difficult to pull off, it seems, with comedy. 
[00:16:00]  Everywhere has failed.  It works with politics for some reason, because it's kind of like background noise.  You don't have to...  Somebody else said this.  You don't have to invest in the personalities.  It's hard to invest in a bunch of shows all day, where you get to know all the players  on every show.  Yeah.  And you can't hear the same stuff joked about over and over.  You can hear the same Republican point made over and over, but the same thing...  If you're a Republican, hardcore, you'll sit there and go, yeah!  But you know what I mean?  It's like you can hear a point reiterated. 
[00:16:30]  Uh-huh.  But when you hear a joke reiterated, and we talk about the topics of the day, there's  going to be another station.  If there's a show right after us that's doing comedy, they're going to talk about what happened  in the sports today.  They're going to talk about the same crap we're talking about to a certain degree.  Yeah.  Yeah, we try to find some different stuff, but you're absolutely right.  But just the topical stuff, you can only hear joked about it so many times, and you're  like, I write already.  Yeah.  Once the joke's gone, it's gone.  It's very tough with comedy.  It's failed all over, which shows you that there's something with the format that's a little  weird.  Right.  It's a good idea, but it just doesn't work. 
[00:17:00]  Dennis D. from Jersey.  There you go.  Goodbye, Blue Sky.  All right.  We got that bit out of here today as well.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Hi, Brooklyn Ace.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Morning, guys.  How's it going today?  All right, man.  Good.  What do you got?  Just felt like calling in, saying good morning.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys know it was my birthday yesterday?  I really thought it was going to be a real call, and not this goddamn Thursday thing.  But it was his birthday yesterday.  Happy birthday, Brooklyn Ace.  Hey, thanks, bro.  I turned 41 yesterday, so.  There you go.  I'm almost caught up to Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  The big F1.  Eh, well.  All right, sir.  Hey, listen, guys.  Have a good day.  You know, maybe I'll talk to you later.  All right.  Let's go to Dennis in Boston.  Useless.  You're listening on BCN.  We're going up to BCN for their Halloween party.  We're going to have the details on our show tomorrow morning.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Dennis, what's up?  Hello.  I have a fun fact, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now, this is better.  Yes.  Okay.  The Ramsey's condom is named for Ramsey's III, the Egyptian pharaoh who had 160 children. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Why would they name a condom after someone that had that many children?  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  Well, maybe he's probably the worst example of someone who didn't have one.  If you have 160 kids, you certainly could have used one.  I don't think they really put the emphasis with condoms on the fact that they are helpful  in preventing pregnancy and disease.  I think they really want to put the emphasis on virility and this will really, boy, you'll 
[00:18:30]  be able to just with this thing on.  You know, the commercials aren't really geared toward that.  I saw one last night and it was a bunch of pigs, I guess, a bunch of pigs walking around  a bar.  Fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  That was fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  This pig's walking around a bar on some chicks and then one of the pigs goes up to a condom  machine and pulls out a condom and all of a sudden he turns into a guy and he walks  up to the bar and gives the girl like a look like, hey, I got a condom. 
[00:19:00]  And of course, they're going to be effing.  But nothing about, you know, disease or pregnancy.  They like positioning these condoms like they're going to feel better than if you weren't using  one, which now I'll say right now.  We me and my girl are in condom using phase because her pills got all screwed up because  of the prescription.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Tell me about it. 
[00:19:30]  Holy mother of God.  I haven't used one of those in so long.  Since you were 15.  Oh, and they're awful.  I mean, they're good in the fact that you're at least you're doing you're doing it, but  they just do not feel good.  They don't feel like, you know, that when you when you first start going at it, let's  say, and there's just the initial you don't get that. 
[00:20:00]  That.  Wow.  That's really good.  It's it's just not there.  It's awkward.  You're rolling.  Let me roll this down for you.  Hate him.  I got to deal with it for a month.  Really?  Yep.  Why?  Pills kick back in.  I wouldn't do it.  I have to.  Why?  Because I don't want kids. 
[00:20:30]  You don't have to have kids.  You're a great gambler.  You think I win?  Please.  Of course.  Oh, damn.  Snake eyes.  I don't want that.  So you're going to survive the month or what?  Going to have to.  Yeah.  Dude, I have to.  There's no way.  No way.  Am I having any kind of kids?  And back.  I remember some real risks back in my younger days where it was just like, I don't. 
[00:21:00]  There was a girl once and we were upstate.  Me, my brother, a bunch of friends were all upstate and we all had our girlfriends with  us.  And she had never been with a man.  And I was going to be the guy.  What a catch for her.  I was going to.  It certainly was.  It was a catch for quite a few girls back in those days.  Let me tell you.  They could all tell stories.  I am embedded in many a girl's head. 
[00:21:30]  Did she get on a bus to meet you?  Yes.  We met at the bus station.  And I'm indirectly trashing you.  You know, I know.  I don't care.  All right.  All for good radio.  Go ahead.  We're in a cabin upstate.  And I figure I need a condom for this.  So I knew some of the guys that I was with had been in relationships with these girls and  probably might have had some condoms.  So I'm searching.  But at that point, I swear to you, I did not know what a condom even looked like, like  what it came in. 
[00:22:00]  I knew it was a rubber thingy, you know, but I didn't know what it looked like in a package.  So I went into another room where another couple's in there sleeping and I'm rummaging  through their stuff on the dresser tops, on the end tables.  And I grabbed a girl's, one of the other girls' contact cases and went into the bedroom and  go, I think I got some.  And I opened it up and it's a contact lens. 
[00:22:30]  Needless to say, I couldn't use it.  I couldn't put it on.  Not only did she get pregnant, but the kid had 20-20 vision.  You couldn't put it on like a yarmulke.  Yeah, that's what I figured I did.  I figured you'd just kind of put it on like and just covered it.  And I knew it wasn't a condom at that point.  But you know what I did?  I said, ah, what the hell?  What are the odds?  Roll the dice.  That's it.  Roll the dice.  Because in that situation, your thinking is definitely impaired. 
[00:23:00]  So that was it.  That was it.  Luckily, nothing happened.  But nowadays, no.  No.  Don't want a kid.  Too much trouble for a land.  Why would it be trouble?  You'd be a great dad.  Trouble.  You would teach your kid a lot of interesting things.  I'd probably be one of the best dads in the world. 
[00:23:30]  But I'm too selfish as a person.  I like my time.  I like what I want to do when I want to do it.  If I want to run off somewhere to a casino or another resort.  Yeah, but what if you have one of those cool kids where that doesn't really interrupt that crap?  Yeah.  A cool kid.  I've seen parents out there that end up having cool kids and their life really isn't interrupted.  Oh, no.  It's interrupted from the time they come out.  Plus, you got money where you can like, you know.  For like years. 
[00:24:00]  Get people to like change those pesky diapers and stuff.  Yeah.  What am I going to have a nanny?  They can do all the dirty stuff for you.  I don't know if you want a nanny raising a kid to tell you the truth.  You got to do it yourself.  And then the fact of the matter is, it doesn't matter how cool your kid is.  That coolness ain't going to come out until the earliest, like six.  Then they might be like, wow, your kid's growing up kind of cool.  You could take them places and talk to them like maybe a human being for a few minutes before they start crying.  And then you got to stoop down and talk on their level. 
[00:24:30]  When I see fathers, I see guys my own age going, what do you want?  Yeah, that's good.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  It's like, oh, my God.  He's talking like a baby.  He's an adult talking like a baby.  Did your dad wreck it for you?  I'm trying to think.  That's what adults do, though.  He might have.  He's supposed to talk like a baby.  I don't like that.  You can't talk to an infant and go, the fourth quarter stocks are dropping.  Why not?  Because the kid's stupid.  The kid should talk like an adult at that point.  But for those five years, your life is just in limbo. 
[00:25:00]  You're done.  It's spent wiping and cleaning up crying and messes and broken bones and wondering if your  kid's got some frigging mental disease.  I understand all that.  But where does it come from?  Did your dad wreck it for you?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Maybe he did, because I kind of saw him as being imprisoned by kids.  I saw him not wanting...  I really believe this comes from somewhere, because I really think...  And a couple people are calling.  They're saying that you would be a great kid. 
[00:25:30]  My daddy had a great love for me.  Believe me.  I know that.  But I felt he was imprisoned by children, like by having a wife and kids.  He didn't want it.  He was selfish, too.  He wanted to go out west and be a cowboy.  He was young and broke, wasn't he?  There's a difference between being young and broke and being ready.  Yeah, but I have the mindset of a young, broke person.  I really do.  But you took notice of something and that planted the seed.  Maybe.  Yeah, you might be right on that one.  But, you know, so be it. 
[00:26:00]  I can't fight that.  That is something I just...  I understand.  I have a fear of children, of having children.  I like children.  I like playing with kids.  Kids love me.  Like, when I go over houses, unless they're picking their nose and wiping it on my couch,  but when I go over to people's houses and they have kids and stuff, kids love me.  I play with the kid.  I'll throw a ball around or whatever.  But the thought of having my own, oh, never.  Never.  I understand that. 
[00:26:30]  I understand that you're not going to change, but it's really interesting to see where this  comes from.  Yeah, it might be my own horrid childhood that I had as far as parenting went.  Yeah.  And you just took notice.  Yeah, I took notice.  I looked at poor, happy dad.  And your mom working her ass off to try to raise three kids.  Yeah, and then mom's got to...  Poor mom.  She's just stuck.  She's stuck.  She got to the point where she finally raised kids and in her 40s, she said, you know something?  Get the F out.  I'm having fun with my life.  You guys, I'm done with you. 
[00:27:00]  And I'm 21 years old or something to go, but mommy, you're kicking me out of the house.  I'm an adult.  And I'm just like, I don't know what to do.  Oh, grow up.  Grow up.  Went out.  I'm stealing people's Hydrox cookies in a room for rent across the hall from me because  I didn't know how to make a living for myself.  I thought you got kicked out before 21.  No, it was like 21.  That's not too bad.  It was pretty bad. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, I was living in my car.  No, I know all that.  I thought that was at 17, 18 years old.  No, I was about 21.  17, 18, I was still living with my mom.  And then it just got to the point where she said, that's it.  Get out.  I need to have some fun here and live my life.  I'm done.  And you're like, but, but, but, but, but, but.  But I have a room in this house.  But what about me?  I don't have to buy toilet paper.  I got into an apartment and realized, I got to buy this stuff. 
[00:28:00]  Shampoo.  How many times I just took soap and rubbed it in my hair.  Yeah.  All right.  We're running late.  We got to take a break.  We're going to continue with that a little bit today.  A little psychoanalysis.  No, because I'm trying to figure some of this stuff out.  Yeah.  I'm a, I'm a weirdo.  It's a new phrase, a phrase, a new phase of our relationship.  Yeah.  I want to see where some of this stuff comes from.  Yeah.  I think I know where it comes from.  I think it is.  Because I really do believe you'd be a great dad.  I think it is the early days of me. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll go to break with this.  Anthony's daycare.  I like this one.  Oh, yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You love your kids, but sometimes they can be a handful.  Kids are great when they're other people's.  Who can you trust when it comes to your young'uns?  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis is a paradise.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoyed.  And most of all, Anthony's love.  I can only hope your child turns up like little Adam Walsh without his head. 
[00:29:00]  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around.  For aesthetics.  Just listen to these happy children frolic through Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid.  And I wish him dead.  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat and say,  We love you, Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody. 
[00:29:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  This is a very interactive radio show.  You've got to know that by now.  You've got the instant feedback off our website.  You've got the pal talk.  You've got the phone.  The phone.  The stupid phone.  I think we take more phone calls than any other radio show in America.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  I think we get some of our best stuff from our listeners.  And we have no problem acknowledging that.  The phones have always been rough.  I know at radio stations.  When I was a listener trying to call in.  I hate that.  It's like, meh, meh, meh, meh.  And then you dial and dial and busy, busy.  And then you get, brrr, brrr.  You're like, oh, it's going to go through.  Meh, meh, meh.  What happened?  It was ringing and then went to a busy.  Nothing ever does that.  Well, we're kind of stuck with this phone call Thursday. 
[00:30:30]  Look at the phones.  Oh, I know.  As soon as we hang up.  And if we hang up on you on this show,  don't take it, you know, don't take it too hard.  We just got to move on because we got to try to entertain the people.  We don't have time to be polite to you.  Sometimes we just clear all phone lines to try to get something going on.  Are you saying we're fresh?  Fresh.  Fresh.  Fresh.  Yeah.  So I don't know what to do with this phone call Thursday  because now people with real stuff can't get in today.  See, that's what I was saying. 
[00:31:00]  But someone from their cell phone, Mike D from Chicago.  Cell phone?  I hid this uncomfortable cell phone.  Mike D from Chicago.  We don't know how much longer we got on WCKG.  We're being honest with our Chicago audience.  You know, that huge Opie and Anthony audience that we have in Chicago.  Yes.  Mike D from Chicago writes,  Why doesn't Anthony get a vasectomy?  Because you were talking about how...  Get off.  Well, you don't want to have kids.  Get out of here.  Wait.  Now, there's not even like a small part of your brain that would consider having a kid. 
[00:31:30]  No, I don't want a kid.  A hundred percent no effing way, right?  A hundred percent no effing way.  Girlfriend, her pills got messed up, so you have to like wrap.  Yeah.  So, why don't you get the vasectomy?  Then you never have to worry about that again.  I think mostly, there's probably a few reasons.  One of which is, I don't like any pain down there.  And I hear there is pain involved.  You got to take the frozen peas and put them there. 
[00:32:00]  I saw the operation done on one of these medical channels, and it just looks disgusting.  They cut the side, pull out this little piece of spaghetti with a probe, and snip it, and  then burn the ends.  It's a tiny little slit.  The vasectube.  And then they take tweezers, and they pull that tube out.  Yeah.  And then they chop.  And then they chop a little piece of it out.  Not even chop, snip.  They snip, snip.  The little piece is, it's, you know, about an eighth of an inch long. 
[00:32:30]  Jimmy's still confused by the peas.  No, no.  Do they, do the peas are frozen peas?  Yeah.  The frozen peas are used on.  Yeah, in a bag.  Okay.  People use that all the time when they have to ice down an area.  An area that's, you know, not a flat contour.  They discover that a bag of frozen peas are very, very good.  It gets into the nooks and crannies.  Or for icing down stuff.  Better than ice cubes.  Let me ask you, I don't know, the vein that they cut is in your testicles, right?  It's right at the top of, um, where, uh, the, uh, scrotum meets. 
[00:33:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  And there's a, uh, an incision that's made there that's about, eh, a quarter to a half  an inch at most at the top.  And then they go in with this, like, hook-like probe and pull out this white tube.  And that's the tube that delivers the baby makers, um, and then they, they, they snip  a piece out of it.  Right.  So now if, uh.  A little piece of spaghetti, it looks like.  And then they burn, they, they cauterize each end, the open end of what they've cut 
[00:33:30]  out, uh, of.  Oh, I thought they kept that just, uh, like, just a gap there.  And if you were going to get a girl pregnant, you know, your, your guys had to, like, do  an evil Knievel.  Set up a ramp across the Snake River Canyon or whatever the hell it was.  Oh, wait, they do leave it connected but burned, so it's almost like.  No, it's not connected anymore.  So what, are they just free-floating your body?  They, I, I think they're just reabsorbed into your body is what happens because they can't 
[00:34:00]  go anywhere.  But that always, I always thought that would make, cause that problem that you get when  you get, um, uh, worked up and can't finish, uh, anything, it, you get in severe pain.  Because it seems like if you have something like, if you have a vein that's being pulled  taut between two ends and you snip the middle, doesn't it seem like it would be almost like  a, like a pulled, it would just kind of go back each way, like, like window shit.  No, I don't think it's under that kind of pressure.  No, it's kind of loose.  It's just kind of loose and, yeah, it needs room to expand and contract.  If you need to know more, just look to your right, uh, YouTube. 
[00:34:30]  God bless YouTube.  Oh, there it is.  A man's vasectomy.  Yeah.  Uh, right there on YouTube.  When I was looking, they, uh, were poking needles in the old, uh, in the old hornet's  nest.  They're doing the old gag called the, we call that the brain.  That's, that's what I see on my camera.  Anytime Keith, the cop gets it when I'm not around.  Oh yeah.  I've seen Keith.  He's like, yeah, I brained Anthony.  Yeah.  That's, I'll be going through my pictures and go, Oh, Keith.  He'll let, now see, look, look at what he's doing. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, see, I don't need that.  I don't need that done.  Yeah.  But you're not going to feel that.  Oh God.  He just poked with a scissor.  You don't feel that.  I don't care.  You don't feel that.  That's a big vein.  It's all numb down there.  They didn't even cut them yet.  No, they, they, they poked it through.  Look, see, now they pull out, pull it out.  Here's the slice.  It's a very little incision.  Look, just enough to pull it out.  Here's the slice.  The slice is nothing.  You can handle that, Anthony.  Oh God.  Got a little needle in there. 
[00:35:30]  Look, all the guys in this studio right now are holding themselves.  Look at that.  I am holding.  All right.  A little more of a, a, a, a slice.  A little slice.  Looks like he's cutting a worm in half.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks like a worm.  Yeah.  That's what it looks like.  By the way, someone, Mike, Mike D is saying 10 minutes in the doctor's office.  You sissy.  Is that it?  10 minutes.  They freeze you up.  They, yeah, they, yeah.  Oh, wow.  10 minutes.  10 minutes with the mob. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, that's all.  10 minutes with the mob.  If you're a rat.  But you're knocked.  But dude.  It doesn't matter.  Dude.  It's like filling a cavity.  They numb you up.  Hello.  They numb you up and you're, you don't even know what's going on.  You're done.  When you're done.  And then when the, the, you know, the Novocaine wears off, yeah, you feel it for a little bit.  Uh-uh.  No siree, Bob.  And things look different.  Okay.  I figured they would.  That's the, I would want that.  Stuff looks different because it's, uh, yeah.  No.  Stuff looks different because there isn't an additive in there. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  That is normally involved.  No.  In, uh, uh, that.  Is it like going to the diner and if you said, uh, hey, I'd like, I'd like a glass of milk,  please.  And they bring you water instead.  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  If you were to take that glass of water and throw it on your girlfriend's back, it would  look silly.  You still want a good presentation.  Right.  You want a nice presentation.  I want a nice presentation. 
[00:37:00]  I don't want anything screwed up like that.  But would the glass of milk be fuller than the glass of water or would they be the same,  the same size?  I believe the same size, uh, uh, glass of water or milk.  Oh, that's fine.  But it just would, would freak me out, uh, seeing, uh, water being spilled everywhere.  Why?  Instead of, uh, a glass of milk being spilled.  I prefer it.  It would just like, no, why?  Why?  Because if you spill milk all over the sofa, it's a pain in the ass to clean up.  You spill water, no one notices it. 
[00:37:30]  And there goes.  Jack, Jack, take care of it.  Oh, no.  Jack, Jack.  Steve from Bayshore, give me that.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, look, he's tugging now.  He's tugging.  He's snipping the vein.  Yeah, this is all, look.  I can't even watch this.  Look.  It's no big deal.  Dude, that is not what you want to see.  And there you go.  You don't want to see anyone doing it.  What is he using?  He's using, like, wire cutters.  God, they got a, they got a follow procedure, man.  You would think this would have been done by now. 
[00:38:00]  Didn't you used to think doctors were very delicate with surgery?  Oh, man.  Where it was, like, scalpel, and then they very delicately cut things and move things  around.  They are working in there like mechanics on a car.  They're pulling, chiseling, sawing things.  All the surgeries I see on TV now, yeah, it's deeply disturbing.  Oh, they're pulling, tugging.  How rough they are.  They're very rough with their surgery.  They dab.  They constantly dab that cotton or that little golf.  Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.  It's like trying to get the little, there it goes. 
[00:38:30]  He just cut.  It's like trying to get the little bit of jelly out of a jelly jar.  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Clang, clang, clang.  I don't, I don't need any of that.  I'm not getting one of those.  It's been suggested a couple of times, but my answer is always nine.  Nine.  Well, you can have it.  The thing is, the amazing thing is that you can have it undone.  If you want to have kids someday, they can reverse the procedure.  It's not the fact that wanting to have kids.  Yeah, he doesn't want to have kids.  I don't want to have that done to me. 
[00:39:00]  It really does.  That's what it comes down to.  You don't want to have that something I don't want to have done to me.  It looks like they have a man's bald skull trapped in a vice.  Exactly.  And they're removing his brain stem.  Like above the eyebrow ridges, they just have his head closed.  Yeah.  It looks like a cancerous tumor.  It's not a tumor.  The sequel to Silence of the Lambs, and they had Ray Liotta, and they opened up his head.  Opened up the top of his head in one of the most ridiculous scenes in movie history.  Exactly. 
[00:39:30]  Way to wreck a great franchise.  The top of his head is off, and his brain is showing.  Karen, those brains are all I had.  They were going to eat them.  No, they weren't.  And then he just walks into the room with the top half of his head off.  Yeah.  I'm like, what are you doing to this great franchise?  I don't think brains have that much steadfastness to just stay there with the top of the skull off.  I think they spill out.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Ant. 
[00:40:00]  I just wanted to tell you what happens when a vasectomy goes wrong.  I had it done about 10 years ago.  Excuse me.  And the doctor's in there, and you stay awake, and he numbs the area, makes the slice.  He's cutting the vas deferens tube.  He cuts it in two different spots, cauterizes each end, puts the titanium clips so nothing, like there's nothing left of chance.  And I mean, in the long run, it's worth it, but when I was in there, I saw the smoke start coming up and the smell when he's burning the tube, and he's like, dude, don't pass out. 
[00:40:30]  I said, I'm passing out.  I'm going to be sick.  He's like, count the tiles on the ceiling.  He goes, do anything.  Just hang on.  And I said, let go of my, let go.  It felt like he's squeezing and twisting the area.  And I said, let go of it.  He goes, I'm not touching it.  And both him and the nurse both put all their hands up. 
[00:41:00]  And I said, it feels like somebody's down there squeezing it and twisting it.  And he's like, just hang on.  Don't pass out.  And let me tell you something.  It was the worst half hour of my life.  I couldn't believe the pain.  I'll tell you what.  In the long run, it's worth it, definitely.  Yeah, well, obviously they did something a little wrong.  There's a lot of people calling in saying it's no big deal.  A lot of people, a lot of my friends said they have it.  I must have went to, like, Dr. Frankenstein.  Well, you don't ever want your doctor going, dude, don't pass out. 
[00:41:30]  You never want a doctor giving a vasectomy, talking to you like he's your buddy in Nom.  Yeah, I know.  Holding your guts in.  Stay with me.  All right, thank you, sir.  Ace of spades.  Yeah, you sit in the back.  Jack of clubs.  He's throwing around death cards.  This guy's holding his groin, sitting in the back seat.  Harvey Keitel's telling him you're going to be okay.  How creepy.  Any man holding his junk can drink out of my canteen anytime.  Drink patty water.  Let's say hi to Randy.  Patty water.  In Chicago.  Randy. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Well, we're hoping we're going to be on in Chicago for a while to come.  We still haven't had a real good shot at Chicago, but we're hearing things.  We're hearing things.  Thanks.  As soon as you said that, I started panicking.  I'm like, I need to call right now because I don't want you guys to leave.  You guys are awesome, man.  Thank you.  Well, the word's going around that Fresh has been registered to this fine station you're  listening to us on, CKG.  So we don't know what that means, to be quite honest with you.  It could just be.  I don't know what it could be, actually, but we're hoping that we get to survive because 
[00:42:30]  we like Chicago.  What do you got, Randy?  Oh, I just want to clear up one thing that Anthony said.  There's no difference in the texture or what it looks like.  I've had a vasectomy, and this is like my third year, and there's no way you could tell  between water and milk.  Now, how is that possible when the stuff that is, yeah, the powdered milk, say you're using 
[00:43:00]  powdered milk, and you use water and the powdered milk.  If you take away the powdered milk, you're just going to end up with water.  How about we just get a doctor on the line instead of a listener from Chicago?  How about Dr. Steve?  Yeah, let's get a doctor on the line, and we'll answer that question.  Okay.  But Randy's saying there's no difference.  There has to be.  The man says there has to be.  There are two compositions to what we're talking about. 
[00:43:30]  When a woman gets pregnant, she supplies the egg, and the man supplies the sperm cell.  Now, the sperm cell has to travel in semen, which is excreted from the prostate, and that's  what it travels in.  It needs some kind of fluid to travel in.  If you are just taking the fluid from the prostate, it's colorless. 
[00:44:00]  The color is added in because of the population of sperm cells.  So if you take that out of the mix, it's going to be clear.  Maybe that's not the only thing that colors it.  I think it is.  But the key here is I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I know.  Let's get a doctor on the line.  I actually just looked at you and said, well, maybe it doesn't.  Like, if you would have said the sperm does not at all have anything to do with the color,  I might have said, well, maybe a part of it might.  No matter what, I would have just conjectured.  Let me also put it this way. 
[00:44:30]  There is a certain substance beforehand that men deal with that is colorless.  Alcohol?  That I'm trying to be as nice as possible here and not get dumb because we are having an  intelligent medical conversation here.  You know what I'm talking about?  Well, it's clear.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That is what you're talking about.  That is exactly the same stuff you're talking about as later on what happens when it's mixed 
[00:45:00]  with the cells that then can impregnate women.  So, if you take the cells out, it's going to look like that the whole time.  Okay.  But, don't they say that, you know, if you're with a girl and you're hooking up, that she  can't, you have to be careful the whole time through.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, in the very beginning, if you're in...  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of the cells can get through and swim around. 
[00:45:30]  They say a lot can get through.  Swim around in that.  Yeah.  Well, that's dangerous.  But it's such a small number, you don't notice any color difference.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get a doctor to answer a couple of these questions.  Also, some show in Cleveland, I don't know, trashing us, I guess.  I've looked at this guy's website.  He's dangerous.  Oh, boy.  This guy is dangerous.  We'll talk about that next.  This guy's nuts.  The funny thing is, this show, I swear to you, I've never heard of the show before in  my life.  They obviously have heard of us, so don't you kind of lose? 
[00:46:00]  Right off the bat?  Don't you lose right off the bat?  Oh, I don't know.  This guy's dangerous.  Let's not tangle with him.  Like, these guys are very aware of the Opie and Anthony show.  More fat-sos.  More fat-sos in radio.  What's wrong with you fat-sos?  We'll get into it next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  So, I guess there's a show in Cleveland that's taking a shot at us. 
[00:46:30]  Dude, don't.  Let's not deal with this guy, please.  This guy is a problem.  Could be trouble, huh?  Dude, I've heard this guy.  He's a dangerous guy, man.  One of those guys that just brings it.  He knows how to bring it?  Oh, man.  He's hardcore.  These are fun, by the way.  And if this show thinks they're going to get a lot of attention from us, nah.  Enjoy a day, maybe two days, and then you go back into obscurity. 
[00:47:00]  I love these shows because I swear to you, I've been on radio since I was 18.  I know the players in this business big time.  Yeah.  I've never heard of the Maxwell Show, and I swear to God.  Is that what they're called?  I've never heard of the Maxwell Show.  Obviously, they have heard of us because they're talking about us,  and now I'm hearing from our Cleveland listeners that they talk about us  on a regular basis.  And guess what?  It finally got to our attention.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks for talking us up. 
[00:47:30]  Steve from Chicago.  I hope you guys were kidding about your time being limited on WCKG.  I love your show and listen for about an hour a day,  Monday through Friday, on my drive into work.  You guys rock.  I wish you continued success.  Keep it up.  We're just hearing things about Chicago.  Could go either way.  That's what I'm hearing.  Could go either way.  Could we find the story about a hate mail being doled out?  Because I saw my neighborhood up there.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, we'll get to the bottom of that.  Some kind of hate mail.  It's like your return address on most of it.  I guess every day they make fun of us.  Steve Yu from Cleveland.  Thank you to our Cleveland listeners for helping us out here.  Uh, it's the middle of the afternoon and we're saying good morning.  He always says that.  See, we're a syndicated show, douchebag.  Oops, that won't get through.  Give me douchebag back!  I know, we really need that back. 
[00:48:30]  Give me that word back!  It says it all.  And it's not, um...  It just dumped out.  Give me that word back.  It has nothing to do with the FCC.  Yeah.  And it says it all.  And it's not even anything that could be thought of as sexual.  Or, or, or...  It's...  It's one of my...  It doesn't conjure an image of sexuality.  It's not titillating.  It's not...  It's not anything.  It's just what it is.  It's one of my favorite things to say when someone pisses me off.  Give me that back! 
[00:49:00]  It's a...  I want that back!  It's a hot water bottle.  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna start...  That's what it is.  I'm starting a petition.  I want that word back on our radio show.  Yeah.  Because it has nothing to do with the FCC.  We study the cases.  No one has ever been fined over that word.  Ever!  Ever.  Ever.  Give it back to me!  We really need that word.  A combination of two words, actually.  So anyway, uh...  You're listening to a syndicated morning show.  Most people know that.  And a lot of our stations, uh, pick us up...  Us up live in the morning. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  But in Cleveland, Rover does a good job in morning.  So we're on in afternoons.  Yeah, he has great radio.  So this show is making fun of us because during, uh, the replay in the afternoons in Cleveland,  every once in a while you'll hear, good morning.  Oh, well, it doesn't mean our show sucks, you idiot.  Do we do good morning every, like, second?  Is that what we're doing?  Wishing people a good morning?  We come back from break and we'll say, uh, good morning a few times.  Uh, let's, uh, say good afternoon to people.  All right, there you go.  Good afternoon.  Hey, good afternoon! 
[00:50:00]  Good afternoon.  How you doing?  How's the drive home?  And then, this is how they're making fun of us because we say good morning because we're  a syndicated radio show in morning drive for the most part, but Cleveland gets us in the  afternoons.  So does that mean that we're less funny?  Does that mean we're less entertaining?  Because yes.  Because it's a tape broadcast for Cleveland?  This is what they had to say, I guess, yesterday?  Two days ago?  E-Rock?  I really don't know.  I don't know this show. 
[00:50:30]  More fatties.  I'm learning more about it because of, uh, because of what they said.  Yeah, this was, uh, a few days ago.  All right.  They said more fattos in radio.  This is from the Maxwell Show.  More embarrassing fat people in radio.  God.  Uh, W, uh, MMS, right?  You know what really kind of, uh, upset me?  And again, I view this as a team thing.  Right.  I don't, okay, but, and dude, so does everyone.  I mean, Stan's better. 
[00:51:00]  You are the, dude, you're like one of the funniest, dude, dude, you are.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,  dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,  dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, 
[00:51:30]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do 
[00:52:00]  Do radio people have any self-control whatsoever when it comes to eating?  Do any of them?  Or is it just...  Because to be honest with you, I think the Opie and Anthony show stands,  we rock...  We're probably the thinnest radio show on the air.  I want to have a scale-off with any other radio program. 
[00:52:30]  Well, because we're not feeding an emptiness every morning.  Yeah, there's got to be something, right?  We're not feeding an insecurity every morning with, you know,  filling up that empty space with donuts.  Donuts.  Dude-da-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood.  Get me some donuts-dood-dood-dood-dood-dood.  How many times with the dude and the donuts?  Could you click the thing every time he says dude?  You might not hear what he's saying.  And I know they're smiling today probably going,  Oh, Opie and Anthony are talking about us.  Trust me, it'll be for a couple days. 
[00:53:00]  Our pest will beat the crap out of you.  Yeah, we couldn't tell you who we were talking about like a month ago.  And then you go back to obscurity.  That's how it works with our radio show.  You know what really kind of upset me?  And again, I view this as a team thing.  Right.  I don't, okay.  But, and dude, so does everyone.  I mean, Stan Zbader, you are the, dude, you're like one of the funniest, dude.  I heard you say it yesterday, and I was happy with that.  You are without a doubt.  Thank you.  Light years ahead of Jim Norton.  You're funnier. 
[00:53:30]  You are light years ahead of that guy.  And that guy should be funnier than he is, because he's a famous road comic, and he ain't  all that funny.  Right.  And neither is...  Oh, brother.  What bothers me about that, it's not even what he's saying.  It's, I don't like the false humility on the other guy.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I've been working.  I've been working hard.  Slow down a little bit, yeah.  He probably put his left hand up and shook it, and then put his head left to right.  I don't know.  Who is the guy he's talking about?  I don't know.  We don't know.  And where can I tune into his HBO special? 
[00:54:00]  We don't know.  And where can I buy his book, his best-selling book?  There's so much...  Who's the comic?  Which one?  This guy in the blue shirt.  The guy in the blue shirt all the way on the left.  Another fat slob.  Another fat nobody.  Here's some of his comedy.  I want to hear some of his stand-up.  Did you look him up?  Yeah, I can't find him.  You can't find any of his stand-up?  He's that good.  Wow.  You lying sacks of fat.  We got a comedy superstar hiding in Cleveland. 
[00:54:30]  Call Hollywood.  So much better than Jim Norton.  Call Hollywood.  So much better than selling out friggin' arena Jim Norton guy.  We got to pull him out of obscurity.  Call Hollywood.  Oh, my God.  The guy cannot possibly be serious when he's saying this.  Well, the comic didn't say it because comics usually aren't that...  We're not that stupid to say something like that.  Even if he probably secretly thinks that he probably wouldn't just come out and say it.  The false humility.  I just didn't like the false humility.  Well, it is good.  Now I've got to hear that. 
[00:55:00]  Let's hear the false humility.  It was very Gleason-ish.  Well, yeah.  All right, pal.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Look, I'm not fooling myself.  Well, down.  Light years ahead of Jim Norton.  Sorry, Eric got his hand up.  Sam just found something.  Apparently, he's never been on TV, but he's waiting for Comedy Central to call him so he can do a Gotham special.  So much better than Jim Norton.  Hey, you know what, though, man?  Dude, dude, if you...  I mean, dude, if you can get Comedy Central to call you, dude... 
[00:55:30]  I like how he interrupted one of his dudes to say dude.  Yeah.  He went like, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  You know what it is?  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  It's like when you quit smoking.  I'll guarantee you this guy went to a hypnotist and the hypnotist said, all right, you're going  to say dude every time you want to slam your fat face into the lap of the man you're talking  to because to control that compulsion, you're just going to say dude.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  The Maxwell Show.  Dude, dude, you are...  I heard you say it yesterday and I was happy about that.  You are without a doubt.  Thank you.  Light years ahead of Jim Norton.  You're funnier.  Well, I don't like that.  You are light years ahead of Jim Norton.  And that guy should be...  Well, I don't know.  Thank you, Garrity.  Wow.  I am.  Hey.  Damn Gleason.  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  You're right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Thank you, Mr. Marshall.  What a loser. 
[00:56:30]  The guy running the show.  It's just...  What a douche.  And it's coming in like crazy.  Every day they talk about how we say good morning.  And that's what they got on us.  That they're live and we're, you know, in tape delay.  I understand the local fellas.  Maybe someday you'll understand when...  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You'll never be syndicated.  So, yeah.  You'll never understand.  I'll just include it.  Light years ahead of that guy.  And that guy should be funnier than he is because he's a famous Rhodes comic and he ain't  all that funny.  Right.  And neither is Opie and neither is Anthony for the... 
[00:57:00]  They're just not that...  I mean, I guess maybe ten years ago they were great, but there's a new sheriff in town.  Ew.  There's a new sheriff?  A new sheriff in town?  Did you just end your little rant with there's a new sheriff in town?  A new sheriff in town?  I like the voice, though.  It's very genuine and not put on.  Yeah.  Private talks all the time.  Just kind of gravelly.  Yeah.  Just a tough-ass MF who showed up.  There's a new sheriff in town and he's eating all the time.  I guess there's not a lot of criminals in your town. 
[00:57:30]  Well, uh...  Not getting much exercise, are you, fatty?  Well, if...  Oh, uh...  We're not funny.  And Jimmy's not funny.  All right.  And they're the new sheriff.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  What is funny?  I want to hear some of their funny.  I would like to hear their funny.  Look, well, we got an example, of course.  You know, we're well prepared.  I mean, if you're gonna talk about our show, we're gonna take a little look at you.  Yeah.  We're gonna take a peek.  And here's something else to the Maxwell Show.  We got the bat phone right to the big guy in this company.  If you think you're that great, send your demo tape. 
[00:58:00]  I'll personally hand it over to Dan Mason.  Yeah.  You loser.  This company's looking for talent all the time.  Guess what?  You don't have it.  Well, I don't know.  He's got a very funny picture.  I like a good funny picture on his website of him with this sleep apnea thing on his face.  Yeah.  Which is just...  It's a funny picture.  Like, if you're gonna be funny, start with a funny photo of yourself.  True.  And go to his website.  What's his website?  Maxwellshow.com.  The... 
[00:58:30]  Or just...  Just Maxwellshow.  Maxwellshow.com.  Mm-hmm.  And put on your laughing hats.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Because I clicked on that picture, and I'm like, this is a funny guy.  All right.  Yeah.  Get the dude bell ready, because...  Oh, God.  This is something...  Look.  Look, we just grabbed the...  We grabbed the bit they did recently.  His crew's name...  He has a black guy named Cracker Man.  That's funny.  Cracker Man.  Wow.  It's Cracker Man, and he's black? 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's ironic.  Oh, my.  That is ironic.  That's ironic.  And the other guy's name is Dan Stansberry, which is a name meant for the Hollywood lights.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hollywood is gonna be calling Dan any day now.  Well, here you go.  You wanna...  Yes.  You wanna hear some audio from the new sheriff in town?  I would, but let's just be...  This guy's a little dangerous.  Let's just kind of go slow with it.  All right.  Here's the new sheriff.  This is the new sheriff in town.  And the comedy that is funnier than anything we do, and certainly anything. 
[00:59:30]  The unfunny, yet completely famous Jim Norton.  As in a genuine voice.  This guy doesn't put on some fat man's radio voice.  This is the way he talks.  And a little inside.  I'll tear down a wall here.  He's attempting to do one of these man's man breaks.  Ooh.  Is that it?  He's gonna talk about how he destroyed his wife last night.  Destroyed?  What do we do?  Make her listen to his show?  I'm like, dude, if we get trashed, we get trashed, but I listened to this clip, he's 
[01:00:00]  not a funny guy.  There's radio guys that just have to do these over-the-top, I'm-a-man type breaks.  No, you wanna destroy your wife.  Connor Peterson, or Scott Peterson, he destroyed his wife.  Yeah.  Here we go.  I'm gonna say Scott.  That's all right.  Stink.  Connor would have destroyed her another two weeks.  Here's the Maxwell show.  So, dude, I would like to tell you that I destroyed my wife last night. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, Maxwell, tell us about it.  You gotta pause for the high-  Yeah, the high five.  The only-  The only people that talk like this are people that didn't destroy their wife last night.  How'd you destroy your wife?  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  This is-  There's so much phoniness in this crap.  If you talk about that really in depth and talk about how much you gave it to her, you  didn't.  This reminds me of, like, Rocco. 
[01:01:00]  And you could be-  Dude!  You could very well be-  I know a lot of people that do talk like this could very well be impotent.  I mean, it's one of those things where you want it to sound like you're really being a  man, and the fact of the matter is, maybe through your weight problem, because you're  a big, fat mess, impotence has snuck its way into your underwear.  Yeah.  And you have a problem like that.  It's been known to happen.  By the way, Jason from Buffalo, you guys were funny 10 years ago? 
[01:01:30]  No.  We all heard the BAB tapes.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  10 years ago.  Cut us some slack.  Yeah, did you ever hear my stuff in the mid-90s?  I was like, hi, how are you?  I was all happy and happy-go-lucky and please love me.  All right, well, there's a lot to get to here, so get the dude bell out.  I do want to say, I know how he destroyed his wife, by the way.  Yeah.  It's when he infected her, because he likes to kneel in front of a booth with a hole  in it and open his mouth and welcome people.  That's what he should have on his forehead, a welcome sign.  So, dude, I would like to tell you that I destroyed my wife last night. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah?  Dude.  Dude, I have to be honest here and come clean by saying that for the past 15 or so years,  I've been telling a lie that I honestly believed, and the lie that I believed was that I'm old.  My sex drive just kind of dropped off the charts.  Now that I am no longer chemically altered yet, I am back with a viper-like vengeance. 
[01:02:30]  Can you pause this so I can laugh?  Wait.  This guy's good har-har-hardy har-har.  I'm guessing he's clean.  Maybe they can have, like, a bell or something so the listeners know when they're supposed  to laugh.  Yeah.  I'm back with a viper-like vengeance.  What is that?  What is he doing?  Well, he's doing...  Silence of the Lambs.  Silence of the Lambs, because he went...  I thought he was doing the viper.  I don't know.  Like a viper tongue.  Oh, maybe he was. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's probably eating.  I'm guessing he's had some sort of chemical dependency, because he said some sort of...  Ah!  Now that I'm back chemically, which maybe he switched something.  I don't know what his deal is.  But maybe that's what it is.  So maybe he's...  Who knows what he's talking about?  Yeah, who knows what he's talking about.  Hopefully it's ACT.  Dude.  So much, in fact, that I destroyed it last night.  And she spoke to the judge this morning. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Dude, and tonight, I will destroy it again, yes?  Dude.  It's the weirdest thing.  Because it's weird.  I'm not really a fan, but I've got to take what I can get.  And I haven't said that in, like, 15 years.  I mean, seriously.  Like, I've got to get to...  Okay, fine.  If this is the way it's got to be, this is the way...  By the way, this is coming in.  He destroyed his wife.  How?  Did he roll over on her?  What a...  The worst part about him, it's not that he bashed the show. 
[01:04:00]  It's his phony, hack radio voice.  Yeah.  Just talk like you talk, stupid.  Yeah, there's no...  He poked to the judge.  The judge.  There's no...  What?  There's no just conversation going on there.  The guy can't even be honest in his delivery.  It's a man's man break.  He's doing...  Radio guys do this all the time.  He's trying too hard to be the intense guy.  Yeah, you gave it to her.  Nice.  Yeah, that's good, man.  Ugh.  How'd you give it to her?  Did you take off your sleep apnea mask first?  You stupid pig. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Can't even sleep without almost killing yourself.  Dude.  Dude, if I don't have a mechanism on my face, I'm gonna die like Reggie White.  Dude.  Drop a few pounds.  You won't need that.  Or sleep on your side, idiot.  Shackass.  I gotta get to...  Okay, fine.  If this is the way it's gotta be, this is the way it's gotta be.  I am destroying it.  Good for you.  Yes.  Great.  Good for you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, dude.  Good times.  Yeah.  And she went nuts.  She woke up this morning.  She was like, did that really happen? 
[01:05:00]  I said, and punt.  Oh, yeah, dude.  What?  What?  You missed a dude.  And what?  What?  His catchphrase to end a sentence or a conversation is and punt.  P-U-N-T.  I don't believe you.  What does that mean?  Like he's done.  And...  Like, and punt.  Like you're done.  Meaning...  Like, yeah.  But if you punt, that means you didn't get the job done.  What is it?  Like...  Like...  And he has and punt t-shirts?  And stickers. 
[01:05:30]  But if you're punting, that means you didn't get the job done.  That's his catchphrase.  He uses it like...  He has a catchphrase called and punt?  He uses it like, I know what I'm talking about and you're stupid.  So and punt ends every conversation.  And punt.  Like next.  Like punch out.  No, punt.  Yeah, I know.  As in football.  That means...  He's using it as a punch out type of thing.  Yeah, but...  But it doesn't make sense.  But that means you're a loser.  Yeah.  That means four downs and you're out.  His...  I now know the lie, by the way, that he's been telling himself for 15 years. 
[01:06:00]  He somehow put and punt and he said, this is going to take off.  That's the lie you've been telling yourself.  No one thinks and punt is catchy or funny.  Only a loser with a loser mentality would come up with and punts.  Because that's like...  That means you're not winning in football.  That means you suck.  You're the and punt guy.  No one...  Yeah.  Yeah, do it.  Do it, dude.  Do it.  Say it.  Do it.  Say it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it. 
[01:06:30]  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  I got my MMS t-shirt on.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  And punt.  Thanks, dude.  Wow.  And punt.  Yeah, dude.  I got what I can't say anymore on the radio.  Did you say douche chills?  Can you say that one, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I got the douche chills.  From this, you know, DC.  Can we hear him say it again?  Because, again, the voice is so gentle. 
[01:07:00]  And punt.  And punt.  Yeah.  And she went nuts.  She woke up this morning.  She was like, did that really happen?  I said, Ant, punt.  Yeah, dude.  Why would you say that to your wife?  Why would you say it to your wife?  Instead of just saying yes or brush your teeth before I give it to you again.  If you ever really said Ant, punt to her, she would probably be like, shut up.  She would kick him in there.  Why am I with this idiot?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I'm not your stupid friends at the station.  Yeah.  I'm not the black guy who called Cracker Man. 
[01:07:30]  Cracker Man.  Just the name alone.  That is great, isn't it?  Oh, Cracker Man rules.  Yeah.  Have that black guy on your show so you can do some racial humor.  That's good.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  It's good to see you're getting over your fears, buddy.  Well, it's kind of a necessary evil right now.  I mean, this is all I got left.  You know what I have left?  One steak.  Ice cream.  Ice cream, Starbucks, and hootenanny.  Hootenanny.  That's it.  Nice.  That's it. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did he just...  No, no, no.  That didn't happen.  And punt.  That didn't just happen.  And punt.  Did that idiot refer to sex as hootenanny?  But I found a worse crime is that somebody felt obligated to laugh at it.  To repeat it and laugh at it.  Just...  Can you listen to hootenanny?  Oh, hootenanny.  He said hootenanny, and that struck somebody's funny bone.  Yeah.  Ice cream, Starbucks, and... 
[01:08:30]  Sex.  Hootenanny.  Hootenanny.  That's it.  Hootenanny.  You didn't.  Hootenanny.  You didn't.  Oh, you didn't.  You didn't.  Yeah.  Oh, it just shows your talent.  I wish I could have came up with hootenanny.  And that explains...  That explains his weight.  Ice cream, Starbucks, and probably shoving everything down his throat.  You must be quitting something.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, obviously, he's... 
[01:09:00]  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Godspeed.  Cream, Starbucks, and...  Sex.  Hootenanny.  Hootenanny.  That's it.  Nice.  That's it.  That's all I got left.  That's all you need, really.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  You're going to tell me that's all I need?  That's all I need.  You raging, whoremongering, dope fiend.  Really?  Is that all I need?  That's all you need.  I haven't seen...  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[01:09:30]  And pun.  That's a genuine laugh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh.  Jeez, why?  Why are we in this business?  Really?  Is that all I need?  That's all you need.  I haven't seen the light yet.  Nah.  Man.  Yeah, dude.  Good times.  I mean, dude, she spoke to the judge.  She got that done in, like, buck 15.  Really?  Oh, dude.  Like the blood is a pub pig again.  What?  I mean, dude, like, the, the, uh, hey, I would compare it to a car that, dude, you've been 
[01:10:00]  due for an oil change and you haven't had it.  You're, like, 6,000 miles over, dude.  The piston's just...  Now you do the flush and fill, dude.  Put some 10W40 in there, boy.  And, dude, you're rocking.  Yes.  You're good to go, huh?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think we really have to worry about the Maxwell show.  That guy is...  I, uh...  Uh, Christina from Cleveland, uh... 
[01:10:30]  I'm not seeing them as a threat.  Stansberry's an effin' fat douche.  He was at a local bar passing out bumper stickers during a Browns game two Sundays ago.  Why doesn't Jimmy pass out bumper stickers?  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy doesn't have to.  Well, I mean, uh, I would like to get a...  Maybe this Dan Stansberry, maybe this guy's a force to be wrecking you.  It's very possible.  So, I mean, a lot of the greats have come out of Cleveland.  Um, I would say let's...  If any of his stuff is around, I say we give it a listen.  In the spirit of fairness, I'm sure this kid is too.  Yeah.  And you're not, uh, listening to a bunch of wusses here. 
[01:11:00]  This is what we'll do for, uh, Dan Stansberry.  You think you're funnier than Jim Norton?  Tape any set from anywhere.  Take your best stuff.  You can do it in front of your mom, in your bathroom, in your shower,  at a comedy club, but I doubt that you're really actually, uh, a working stand-up.  You, uh, this is the challenge.  And you call their show, all right?  You think you're funnier than Jim Norton?  Send a tape in.  And I swear you got my word, we'll play it.  Uh, no more than, like, three or four minutes.  We can't spend that much time on you.  We will play it. 
[01:11:30]  And we'll play your entire set on our syndicated morning radio show.  Dude.  Dude.  All right?  You'll get way more exposure than you get on the stupid Maxwell show.  And we'll see if you're funnier than Jim Norton.  We're not going to sit here and, uh, hide.  That's, that's what we say today to Dan and the Maxwell show.  You know, we know your show's not funnier.  Let's now see if your comedian friend there is funnier than Jim Norton.  Well, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to.  And punt.  That's awful.  You know, instead of this phony radio crap, there you go. 
[01:12:00]  We challenge you now.  You think you're funnier than Jim?  Send in a set.  Thank you, Mrs. Manicotti.  And if you're not going to send in a, in a set, then shut your effing mouth.  God.  Shut your effing mouth.  Okay?  That's what we do today.  And that's why we're in the position we're in.  A syndicated morning show.  Because we don't hide behind our stupid microphone.  Appreciate it, Grogan.  I don't want to.  Get the, get the word to the Maxwell show that we want a set from Dan.  We'd love a set from Dan. 
[01:12:30]  Want a set from Dan.  And we'll play it word for word on our effing show.  Hold on.  What do you say?  Okay.  He's also, what's the MD stand for, sweetie?  Music director.  Oh, he's the music director of MS.  Oh, my God.  I feel sorry for the guy.  Oh, he's Maxwell's producer, too.  Oh, how cute.  How cute.  And co-host.  So this guy's a.  Wow.  And by the way.  Multi-faceted.  After the break.  Real people of genius.  Real people of genius.  Yep.  One of their bits.  That is a little tease.  One of their bits. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  What an original idea, first of all.  It's topical.  It's timely.  But I want to make this perfectly clear again, okay?  Because the Maxwell show, just casually saying that Jimmy's not funny, even though he's got  an HBO special that's going to set the world on fire.  That's right, dude.  And they're all brave behind these things.  Yes, dude.  So now we call you out.  You think your guy's funnier than Jim.  I don't care.  We'll give you three weeks to even train.  Three, four weeks.  We don't give a crap.  Send us a set.  And we'll play it right here on our show. 
[01:13:30]  And don't come up with some lame excuse.  We're talking to well over a million people every single day.  That's great exposure for some nobody in Cleveland.  And we'll see how funny you really are.  Good afternoon, sir.  Oh, by the way, there will be no sets sent to us.  Because they're a bunch of just...  No.  They're just full of you-know-what.  I would...  Because the radio's filled with guys like this.  All brave.  But when you call them out on it, they just run and hide and just kind of go about their  business and make believe they didn't hear this. 
[01:14:00]  And we won't edit your set.  I got to promise the guy that your set will not be edited except for any type of language  we can't play.  No, we're not going to chop you a bit to make you look stupid.  No.  Of course not.  All right.  You know, I don't want to...  Business is filled with these guys.  Bad old crow at that.  They're one-market sensations.  And in this case, this guy's not even a one-market sensation.  No, he's not even a sensation in one market.  He's not even a sensation in one market.  He's a fat slob.  I understand what he's doing.  We're the premiere show for XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:14:30]  And we're still on about 20 regular radio stations.  So bring it on, Maxwell.  Bring it on.  Have your little comedian friends send a little tape, and we'll see if he's funnier than Jim.  All right?  Punt.  Because we can babble.  You can babble.  But let's do it that way.  Let's see what he's all about.  Watch him send a set of comedic brilliance.  Some of the greatest, most cutting-edge material.  Edgy, clean, smart.  Clever.  And we play it, and he gets discovered.  And he gets a show, and I have to audition for it. 
[01:15:00]  It's called the I'm a Fat Pig Show, and Maxwell is cast.  I don't even know if Maxwell's that fat.  I just like saying that.  Maxwell's fat.  And by the way, Maxwell's in the middle, right?  Yeah.  He's a fatty.  And by the way, the reason Maxwell's not doing Morning Drive is because Bob and Tom are.  He probably trashes Rover because he's on a competing station.  I get it.  He trashes us.  Does he trash Bob and Tom?  No.  Yeah, why don't you trash Bob and Tom? 
[01:15:30]  That show blows up.  Come on.  Bob and Tom blow.  All right.  Hey, you know that you have a bunch of crap lying around your place that you don't want or need.  Some old concert t-shirts, t-shirts, CDs you'll never play, and perhaps even some gold or jewelry.

You're going to be laughing so hard. 
[01:16:30]  You're going to drive off the road.  Yeah, get to where you got to go and pull over.  Yeah, put it in park before we play this amazing bit from the Maxwell Show.  And we have a guest coming in a little bit.  Don King.  Don King today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, man.  Mmm.  Welcome.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie is sipping something and almost choking.  He's using some water to wash that down. 
[01:17:00]  What were you eating?  What type of disgusting morning food, afternoon food were you eating?  Well, we got self-control on the show, so instead of big fat donuts every morning, we try to eat, you know, healthy.  God forbid.  A little sensible.  God forbid there's a radio guy that actually stays in shape.  God forbid.  Coming up in a little bit, maybe on the next break, we have Don King who is early plugging his fights at Madison Square Garden on October 6th.  Great events.  Man, that guy's been promoting for a while, huh? 
[01:17:30]  He's amazing.  Geez.  All right.  We're in the middle of giving the Maxwell show from Cleveland a lot of attention.  And I'll say it again.  Don't get too excited, boys.  You go back into obscurity probably by tomorrow.  Not even a one-market sensation.  I guess they got a guy named Dan something.  I don't even know his last name anymore.  What is it?  But it doesn't matter.  But Maxwell, I guess, the main guy is saying that he's funnier than Jim Norton. 
[01:18:00]  Jim Norton's going to be on HBO in the very near future.  What?  October 13th.  Two weeks.  A week and a half.  Yeah.  Like nine days, right?  Yeah, I go to L.A. Sunday, so that's for the 7th.  Yeah, nine days.  And this guy is, I guess he's sitting Cleveland on fire with his comedy.  So instead of sitting here and just babbling through these microphones, we're like, all  right, we'll accept the challenge.  You think your Dan guy's funnier than Jim?  Have Dan send us one of his sets.  We don't care.  We don't care where he gets his set from. 
[01:18:30]  We'll accept any set that he thinks is really, really good.  And we'll play the whole thing in its entirety without even goofing on it.  And then everyone else gets to decide if this kid from Cleveland is funnier than Jim.  New sheriff in town.  But guess what?  We'll never get a tape from this guy because it's another radio show that just babbles through  these stupid things and they don't mean what they say.  Bunch of phonies.  Phonies and liars.  By the way, we've never lost one of these little fatzos.  We've never lost one of these radio battles. 
[01:19:00]  We've never lost.  Not a one.  Don King should be signing us.  For our battles.  We've never lost one of these.  We've duked it out.  Because we call these guys out for being the phonies they are.  Dave Wellington, our fine PD from WBCN, writes, subject Maxwell, this guy's a no talent.  He's been hounding me since my Vegas days for a gig.  He is like a poor man's grease man without the talent.  I could get more ratings from putting an ashtray in the studio than that hack. 
[01:19:30]  You hear that, Maxwell?  Now that's funny.  You hear that, Maxwell?  He'd rather just place.  Let me make this perfectly clear for the listeners.  This is what you would hear every day.  And this would get more ratings than you.  All of a sudden, the mic would be live.  And you would hear the placing of the ashtray in front of the mic.  And that's all you would hear for four hours.  And Dave's saying it would get ratings.  Way more ratings than you. 
[01:20:00]  An ashtray in front of the mic.  It's ashtray in the mornings.  I know.  This guy was pretty funny, though, man.  That break he did on the giving his wife the trainer.  When he used the voices.  Is that what he means by poor man's grease man?  Like he tries to use the little voices to enhance his stories.  Like grease did.  I was slinging lead down.  I was part of the Washington SWAT team.  Yeah.  Sling lead down.  Grease Manelli.  Grease Manelli. 
[01:20:30]  What did he call his drinking again?  What was it?  Bone dry.  I had a bone dry.  Bone dry.  I had a bone dry martini while I thought things over.  And then I grabbed my weaponry and weapons of mass destruction.  I grabbed my.  It went out.  No, it was always.  Delivering justice.  It was always like old school, though.  Like gat.  That's my gat.  My gat.  Dave continues.  So Maxwell, a guy that you sent a lot of tapes to saying you're a hack. 
[01:21:00]  And that he could get more ratings from putting an ashtray in the studio than you.  And then he writes, how many cartons of smokes does he go through in a day?  Way to grill him, boys.  All right.  We're going to have the big announcement.  We're going to Boston for their Halloween show.  We'll have the announcement on our show.  Oh, you want to hear this bit?  This is the real people of genius.  And this is a Maxwell bit.  Yeah.  All right.  Guy who trashed us saying that we're not a funny show. 
[01:21:30]  Not a funny show.  Okay.  Yeah.  New sheriff in town.  Yeah.  And this is what the sheriff is bringing.  This is the type of justice the sheriff is doling out.  Look out, people.  Here it comes.  Real people of genius.  Real people of genius.  Today we salute you, Mr. Driving Around in a Crappy Car with thousands of dollars worth of accessories on it and a loud muffler guy.  Mr. Driving Around in a Crappy Car with thousands of dollars worth of accessories on it and a loud muffler guy. 
[01:22:00]  There's so much about you that pisses me off.  I don't even know where to start.  He really is a rageaholic.  Let's start with those stupid decals you put all over your car.  For a minute there, I thought that might have been one of those high-powered Formula One race cars.  But much to my surprise, it's a Civic.  He's totally dumbfounded.  Thanks to you, Mr. Driving Around in a Crappy...  Dude, I don't know if I can get to the end of this.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  First of all, Than brings up a good point.  There are times when we do this radio show I feel uncomfortable because I know people are going somewhere else because maybe we're not on our game, right?  Yeah.  I'm feeling that right now even though we're just pointing out how awful this is.  I don't know if we can play the rest of it.  And this is like they must have been really excited to play this.  Than brings up a great point.  He says this isn't even a parody.  This is pretty much just doing one of these commercials.  Right.  Because these commercials are just...  This is what they've kind of degenerated to over the years. 
[01:23:00]  I'll admit it.  It's kind of a tired campaign.  You know?  Sorry.  I understand.  You know, I enjoy the beer.  I love it.  But the campaign itself, maybe you can move on.  Ah, they've had better ones.  They've had...  Well, when this first started, it was new, unique, kind of funny.  You know, they brought some irony to it.  Now, they're just kind of...  All right.  And this is an example of exactly what the commercials are now.  You could absolutely have the guy that voices those commercials do this line by line. 
[01:23:30]  And they would play it as a commercial.  So it's not really a parody as much as they're just doing one of these commercials.  Right.  And whatever they're doing, it's not ironic.  And it has the humor value of a mind collapse.  You're not making a point by doing that bit.  Cornball.  Thanks to you, Mr. Driving Around in a crappy car with thousands of dollars worth of accessories  on it and a loud muffler guy, your music and your stereo are loud enough for all of us. 
[01:24:00]  I ran out of breath at the end of that.  Of course you did.  Way to go, Fat Boy.  And what's with the muffler on the back of your car?  The muffler that makes the car louder.  If it was supposed to make the car louder, it'd be called a louder.  Not a muffler, you moron.  It's called a muffler, not a louder, you moron.  You.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I couldn't.  No.  No.  Stop it.  Just stop it. 
[01:24:30]  Just stop it.  Stop it.  Did they write that?  I'm just trying to get the image of them writing it and going, yeah, let's call it a louder.  Or did he just have bullet points, like put a bunch of Zs and then like a spike with louder  on it and then a bunch of Zs and then a spike with another word on it.  Whatever you were going for with that.  I don't know if it was to be ironic or if it was to parody it directly.  Whatever you were going for, it was awful and it wasn't funny. 
[01:25:00]  This is really painfully bad.  And punk.  I hate you regardless of your car.  You know why?  Because you're a white guy with brown hair and blonde highlights that are sticking up from  behind your stupid white M&M visor.  He's the real Slim Shady.  Yes, he is.  So today we salute you.  What does this mean?  What do they mean?  I love when it gets to the point where Anthony just gets angry. 
[01:25:30]  Because I don't know what they're giving, but what it means.  I love this.  It's not making sense.  I love this crap.  How, how, how, holy Jesus.  And the, the harmonies sound like the voices from the miniseries V.  Remember that one?  It's that weird double voice thing.  It's not even, it doesn't resemble the, the sound of the commercial.  And, and, and I don't know what they were talking about.  Instead of a new sheriff, how about just a funny DJ? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Do we have that in time?  Try that first.  Yeah.  How about that?  Go for that.  Steven S., he's the real Slob Shady.  Yeah, anything but Slim Shady.  He's the worst thing.  And he's, he's, he's, what he is, he's a cornball.  He's a cornball.  He's, have him out in the sun and use him for Shady.  Okay.  Today, that was hack, but I had to say it.  You're driving around in a crappy car with thousands of dollars worth of accessories on it  and a loud muffler guy.  If my daughter ever dates a guy like you, I'll kill myself. 
[01:26:30]  Well, there's hope.  How about your co-host?  Mr. Crack Man.  Or Cracker Man.  Cracker Man.  What if, what if she brings him home?  I like to make werewolf movies.  Yes.  All right, well, well.  He likes turtles.  Well, we better run scared because, oof.  Those guys are dangerous.  They're very dangerous, Jimmy.  They're on fire.  You don't want to play, uh, name that whore, do you? 
[01:27:00]  No, no.  I don't need to hear any more of this because people are just going to run away from our show.  Name that whore.  And go to that show.  Yeah, see, we're giving him too much, uh, commercial time.  Boy, people are just going to...  What you're doing is turning people onto him.  In droves.  Well, you know, that's what, uh, that's what some people will say if you do this type of radio,  but, uh, we throw them back into obscurity and then, you know, they get, they get their attention for a day or two  and then they just go away.  Is it true that Benchmark bit is what the F?  No?  Snag it for free, courtesy of the, uh, Maxwell Show. 
[01:27:30]  Time to play Who's That Whore?  Who's That Whore?  With Maxwell.  Yeah.  On 100.7 WMMS.  Man.  All right, Who's That Whore today?  He's going to...  Punt.  Matt and Barberton.  What?  I don't know.  Why did he throw a punt in there?  I don't know.  Why did he punt?  I was just subconscious telling him what to do with this bit.  And Maxwell...  Phony radio voice.  Yeah, and I'm going to bring this up.  Maxwell, who are you? 
[01:28:00]  Are you doing Rocco?  Are you doing Greaseman?  Are you doing Rocky Allen?  Like, whose voice are you trying to imitate?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Because it changes all the time.  Yeah.  It's that growly, fat guy voice.  There's a little man cow in there.  Who are you, Maxwell?  Just sitting here.  Why don't you use your own, your real voice?  Like, dude!  You obviously don't have confidence in your own voice and delivery.  Like, every bit of audio we play, it's a different voice.  This is Rocky Allen here in New York.  Shut up, Wang.  Heh heh. 
[01:28:30]  Dude!  Get back in the kitchen, Wang!  Yeah, it's Rocco!  Linger longer.  What can I tell you?  Snag it for free, courtesy of the Maxwell Show.  Time to play.  Jim.  Jim.  Maxwell's Jim.  That whore!  With Maxwell on 100.7 WMMS.  We've got you.  All right, who's that whore today?  He's going to...  Punt.  Matt and Barberton, what's up, man?  See, I know I'm going way inside here, but this is Rocky Allen. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah?  This is Rocky Allen delivery all the way.  I'll wait to stand by.  Matt, how are you?  How's it going?  I'm good, dude.  How are you?  Matt?  How are you, Matt?  Matt.  Yes, Matt.  Yeah?  Yes, how are you, Matt?  I'm good.  Are you there, Matt?  I am here.  All right, Matt, listen carefully.  Matt!  We each have our own individual dreams and goals, but we are best friends.  We grew up together, and we'll still support each other.  Hey, Matt, who's that whore there? 
[01:29:30]  Is it Beyonce?  Beyonce knows.  You nailed that whore!  Wow, dude, you got it.  Hang on the line.  Wow.  We were not expecting that.  No.  Oh, my God.  That's what he should say if a laugh came.  We were not expecting that.  Wait, wait, that's the big thing, like the funny play on words. 
[01:30:00]  Like, if you guess it, they have a pre-recorded thing that says,  You nailed that.  You nailed that whore.  Oh, I got it.  That's the way guys talk.  Yeah, nailing that whore.  Or, what, is that what they want?  And punt.  And punt.  And punt.  And punt.  And punt.  Well, I'm sure we'll address that on the other side.  And punt.  Yeah.  All right, well, there you go.  There's your attention, Maxwell. 
[01:30:30]  I guess you wanted our attention.  You got it today.  Congratulations.  But you will be back in obscurity within a day.  So, enjoy the attention from our pest today.  Yeah, the pests will have a little bit of fun with you,  knocking you around like a kitten with a little plate boy.  And don't forget, we'll be checking our emails and the snail mail every day,  waiting for that set from your funny comedian friend there.  And he's on from 3 to 7 in Cleveland.  It's maxwellshow.com, and you can contact him.  And maybe you're a fan and you want to just tell him he's great.  800-348-1007. 
[01:31:00]  And that's 3 to 7 in Cleveland.  And punt.  And punt.  I'm sure perhaps Ramon will want to call into the show.  Absolutely.  Frunkus might want to call in.  E-Rock, I'm sure.  The Nagels.  All of the Nagels will be calling in, I'm sure.  Come on.  We do have the best listeners, man.  Oh, my God.  Let's play Who's Maxwell.  Where's the other one?  That was really funny. 
[01:31:30]  Uh, how about we play Who's That Boar?  That was just awful stuff, man.  It's, it's, is it all about just pre-recorded stuff?  Like that, Who's That Whore bit?  Was nothing but, like, their pre-recorded intro and outro.  The whole meat of it was, there was nothing to it. 
[01:32:00]  Well, that's why I said Rocky Allen.  Rocky Allen, uh, sorry, Buffalo.  He's a legend up there.  He's here in New York.  And that's the type of crap he does, and there's no substance to it.  It's a bunch of production.  And then, and then it's like, it's an excuse to say, you nailed that whore.  Yeah.  Why don't you just say, you nailed that whore?  You nailed that whore.  Like, when we're doing something and we play, like, a promo for something, it's, it's a goof.  Because it's funny to goof on that stuff.  But these people, they're actually out there doing that for real.  There's no goof there. 
[01:32:30]  They can't wait to go, you nailed that whore.  Yeah.  The guys are loving this.  Guys love this kind of stuff.  All right.  We got Don King standing by.  I'm very psyched we have Don King in today.  So, by the way, we'll never get the tape from that comedian.  We won't.  The great Don King is next on the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to get right back into this.  It's Opie and Anthony and in studio, Don King, everyone.  A legend.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Why does his mic keep turning off?  What am I doing here?  You know what?  I think you got me all nervous, Don.  Oh, people.  I rarely get nervous, but I'm turning on the wrong mics and everything.  Is he on?  Yeah, now we got you.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Don King.  Opie, Opie, Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  A weekday, 6 a.m., and keeps going on and on and on and on.  Oh, believe me.  We go all the way until about 11, sometimes noon.  We don't care.  Let me tell you something.  We could use a promoter like Don King as far as his radio show goes. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  We need some promotion, my friend.  Well, you got a great radio show.  You know, yesterday, today, and tomorrow, you give the people the information that they  need to know.  When you need to know something, call Opie and Anthony.  They will give it to you like it is.  Now, you got a fight coming up at the Garden.  Faith, hope, and glory.  Yes, it is a fight that was really made by a heavenly instance because it fell apart,  a champion of the world.  He got sick.  We got a back injury. 
[01:34:00]  You know, the Russians do get a lot of back injuries, and we couldn't fight.  So then WBC, in its infinite wisdom, appointed Samuel Peter, the nightmare from Nigeria, as  his interim champion, and he's defending his crown at Madison Square Garden against Jameel  McCline, Saturday, October the 6th.  So it's truly a faith fight because Jameel is getting his fourth opportunity to fight  for the heavyweight championship.  I think I got an email from the Nigerian nightmare. 
[01:34:30]  It said, if I send my bank account number, they're going to wire $10 million over to him.  They're the best in the world.  I love those Nigerians.  Yes, you know, but you know, you never can get beat unless you have larceny.  You know, you got to have want something for nothing, and there is no free lunch, but  they do prey on those who are looking for the pie in the sky.  Yeah.  Like that.  You know, man, I want something sound on the ground while I'm around.  You know?  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  92-3 Rock.  92-3 Rock.  You're all decked out now. 
[01:35:00]  You got your red, white, and blue.  Would you get the bedazzler out there and put the studs on there?  Well, you got to look.  The first thing you got to look at them, support our troops.  That's the one thing I do every time I go on the show.  Sure.  We must support our troops.  We love them.  They're the vanguard of our nation.  The men and women wearing that uniform is the embodiment of America, and we can't forget  that.  So in so doing, we want to be able to celebrate this great nation as the greatest nation in the  world called America, and I say only in America.  And only because we got such a great military, and I'm looking forward to seeing them, supporting 
[01:35:30]  them, and wishing them well, because they put themselves in harm's way for the benefit  of Opie and Anthony and I and a free society to continue to bring you the best in information,  news, music, everything that's happening now.  Opie and Anthony has it for you.  Don, if the troops are over there just for this show, please come home immediately, because  I think it'll be great once Europe, once somebody gets a little rambunctious over there, probably 
[01:36:00]  the Germans, and just starts a problem again, and people go, oh, help us, America, please  help us.  They're all high and mighty with their Euro over there now, feeling all good about themselves,  not realizing what this great country did so that they could do what they're doing now.  So, bad mouth us.  Well, Anthony, I have to agree with you on that point, because...  Of course, Don.  If you were in Paris, and you said, uh, Paule Bouvance, they say, uh, uh, Expectancy 
[01:36:30]  Deutsch.  If the Doughboys hadn't a win over there...  Exactly.  ...and changed that.  I mean, they seem to have forgotten that, but I think Nikolai Sarkozy is a good friend.  Uh, he's gonna change it back to what it was.  Chirac was there, but he was kind of anti...  Jacques.  Yeah, Jacques.  Jacques.  You know what I mean?  So, but we didn't do that.  Jacques Strap.  Yeah, I'm doing a show in Paris on November the 10th with, um, um, John Mark Mormac and  David Haye from the UK.  So, it's gonna be a great thing over there, but with Nikolai Sarkozy, that'll be the first  on his regime, uh, he's a good friend of the mayor of, uh, Levenoir, who is, uh, Bocconi. 
[01:37:00]  When you say France, you say Bocconi, you know?  So, it's a thing that we have, uh, we have a great relationship now that they're gonna  try to change the view.  You're a world traveler.  Oh, absolutely.  And what do you like?  Sort of, uh, you're almost like a, uh, an ambassador.  Uh, you know, without portfolio, I am an ambassador for this great nation called America.  And as you were saying earlier, many people don't recognize, realize, or appreciate what  America truly does, you know what I mean?  So, they look at us as Yankee imperialists, you know what I mean? 
[01:37:30]  They look at us as gonna be the bully, but they got to understand we're fighting  for the freedom, the freedom that they enjoy, and democracy is very different, and around  the world, people wish for what we have, you know what I mean?  We're just about that, but we take it for granted, so we shouldn't do that anymore.  And you're, and it's easy for you to, uh, fly to another country and meet somebody, because  all you gotta do is stick your head out the plane window to do your hair.  Oh, Anthony, Anthony.  Oh, you did a hair joke.  Oh, I had to do a Don King hair joke.  Oh, that's why, because he's got the most recognizable hair, dude. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, Don, I apologize for that.  Oh, I hope we let him roll with it.  I had to, dude.  And punt.  And punt.  What do I know?  Don's amazing.  When We Were Kings, I think, is the greatest documentary I've ever seen.  And to take, what you did was to take money and go to Ali, where you went to form it,  and you got both signatures, and then you went to a dictator and got him to put the money  up.  I think, how?  None of those things.  The rumble in the jungle? 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  Yes.  The rumble in the jungle.  That was it.  Sammy Swart and Zaire, right?  This is a fight that I, uh, I put together.  I got one that's, and the ilk of that is coming up in January here in New York and Madison  Square Garden also, and that's Roy Jones Jr.  and, uh, and, uh, Tito Trinidad.  Viva Puerto Rico!  And that's going to be one of the kind of fights that, where the fighters want to fight  the two icons.  They don't need it, either one.  But they decided, for the public's sake, they didn't meet when it was at the peak of  their career.  But now that their icon tried, true, tested, and established, uh, fighters, legendary in 
[01:39:00]  nature, they're going to meet each other here in a pound-for-pound fight, you know,  that will be at 170 pounds at a catch weight.  And it's just going to be a tremendous evening of boxing, because I liken it to that, uh,  Rumble in the Jungle with, uh, uh, Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.  Oh, he's bringing it back around.  Yeah, he's really coming right back.  Went off-road on us there.  Do you, does it annoy you when Foreman complains?  Because Foreman complains about the ropes.  Foreman says that the ropes were made loose for Ali to kind of go back. 
[01:39:30]  Uh, and that's something he, he said in his book.  He complained a little.  Do you, did you respond to that and just say it was just...  Well, I don't know.  Well, you know, all I know is that the rope-a-dope was created then, and Foreman punched himself  out.  Whether the ropes was out in or whatever, he was swinging, and, uh, he's swinging at  Muhammad Ali.  And, uh, and then when he got tired, Muhammad Ali took advantage of that, uh, situation.  Uh, but I love George Foreman.  George Foreman is one of the greatest guys in the world.  You know, he used to be an iconoclastic, radical type of individual.  Uh, now he's just a big, sweet, jolly, brown giant, you know? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Selling his grills.  We met him with those.  Selling his grills.  He's made a fortune with those grills.  Oh, he's...  And, uh, he came up to the studio one day, and I shook his hand, and it was like somebody  took a, a London broil and just smacked it into my hand.  That guy's got a set of mitts on him.  Oh, he does.  He's a, he's a tremendous guy.  He's, this guy will always stand out with me.  He signed seven blank sheets of paper.  I don't recommend that to anyone, but George Foreman did it with me.  And we had a, he had a lawyer named Steve Bomzer, and, and we went to San Francisco 
[01:40:30]  and filled in all the papers on those, on those signatures, you know what I mean?  And we called him up and read it to him, and he lived up to every bit of it.  So, George Foreman, I applaud you.  You're a man's man.  You're a great guy.  Stand-up guy.  Great American.  George Foreman.  Don, who's, uh, the greatest fighter of all time?  Well, I'd have to say, and my time would be, uh, I didn't have him, but he was great  Sugar Ray Robinson, but for me, in the time that, that I was involved in, it would be  Muhammad Ali.  You know, Muhammad Ali was just a fantastic individual. 
[01:41:00]  He tried to emulate and imitate Ray Robinson, you know what I mean, as a heavyweight, and  Ray was a middleweight.  So, Ali was one of the fastest guys out there with the agility, the dexterity, the lateral  movement, the capability of punching going forward or backward.  I, I coined a praise for him, you know, every knee must bend, every head must bow, every  tongue must confess, thou art the greatest, the greatest of all times, Muhammad, Muhammad Ali.  And another question about that, why does the world love Muhammad Ali?  Well, you know, he wasn't always loved.  He was always scorned, you know, at first, you know, maybe because... 
[01:41:30]  Well, yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  He turned all that around, and it's nothing but love wherever he goes now.  That's the truth.  But, you know, basically, people stand up, you know, I think as Abraham Lincoln said,  one, if you're right, is a majority.  And he was right, and so he stood there, so he had to take the abuse, the misuse.  But as he continued to stand firm, you know, as David Henry, David Thoreau would say, you  know, he, he came out of it.  Now everybody loves him, and then he carries the torch.  But he stood for something.  If you don't stand for something, you don't live for nothing. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, you got to stand for something, O.P.  That's why it makes you so dynamic on this show.  You and Anthony are just, you know, incomparable.  And it makes me feel good to be sitting in your presence.  Yeah, promote us again.  Come on, Don.  Oh, man, we need a promotion.  Let's go.  We want everybody, O.P. and Anthony, to be at the Garden on Saturday night, so you  ought to come on down.  It's going to be a great fight.  We got six or seven countries.  Now, let's think about this.  This is a fight of faith, hope, and glory.  You got Andrew Gulotta.  You know, he's coming in from Poland.  Excuse me, the powerful Pole.  You got to use the nicknames there, Don.  I got to help you out here. 
[01:42:30]  Help me, O.P.  The powerful Pole Gulotta.  And then he's taking on the Irish kid.  I was at the Irish pub yesterday.  It was just so fabulous.  They were all singing songs.  You know, the Irish like to sing songs and have their little cups.  You have a little nip.  Yeah, every now and again.  Every now and again, sure.  You know what I mean?  It was just so great.  And we had a beef pie.  And it was unbelievable.  It was the owner's mother's recipe. 
[01:43:00]  It was a tremendous, deliciously, oh, I think about it now.  It was real gusto.  You know what I mean?  And then chicken pot pies and all the things that were serving them.  Hocus.  Hocus.  It was really great.  Hocus.  Yes.  And now I'm back, you know.  All right.  But anyway, we're there with Irish.  And Kevin McBride, the last man to beat Tyson.  He's called the Tyson Conqueror.  Nicknames, Don.  Tyson Conqueror, yes.  You know, and he was there.  So we got Ireland.  Then we got Australia with Kelly Meehan, the thunder from down under.  You know, he's taking on DeVarro Williams, the Colorado kid.  You know what I mean?  So you got all of these countries going in there. 
[01:43:30]  And from Australia, Ireland, a Nigerian nightmare.  And where's the Colorado kid from?  Colorado.  All right.  Thanks.  That would be great.  If he was the Nigerian, the Colorado kid.  And we need everybody to come out there because this is a real United Nations type of a car.  The aggregate of all of this is what we're trying to do is emulate the United Nations  and give them something that they can do with frivolity and enjoy and entertainment and excitement.  The United Nations should go in there and just start beating the crap out of each other. 
[01:44:00]  Probably get more done.  I'm inviting the whole Security Council to come down and be our guest because since they fight so well in the U.N.,  I think there would be an example right there in Madison Square Garden.  So the entire Security Council is invited to the fight here at Madison Square Garden while they're in session here at New York at the U.N.  Don, what do you think?  I have a question about Mike Tyson because it's like, you know, there was something about Tyson.  It's like at one point he grabbed people in a way like I think in a way Ali did where you just thought this guy could be the greatest you've ever seen. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know how you guys on the inside saw him, but the public has this fascination with him that started before it became a train wreck  when he was like, you know, Kid Dynamite, when he was just destroying everybody.  What is it about Tyson that made people?  Because I mean, I got caught up in it too.  I don't even know why I love this guy so much.  Well, I got caught up in it.  I'm still in it.  I love Mike Tyson.  I think Mike Tyson was one of the throwbacks to what the, you know, that form of manhood and fighting that you could emulate, imitate,  or you could get in there and when you're shaving, you know what I mean, instead of saying, take it off, take it all off, 
[01:45:00]  you would think that I'll knock him out like Tyson did.  He was a knockout artist, so he had an infectious smile and he could get people there and he,  big and strong as he was in talking to a little baby voice, you know what I mean, so it was just tremendous.  So he was a great gladiator.  You know, he just listened to people talking to him, whispering in his ears what made him aberrate from the norm,  and this is what happened to him.  But, you know, I have nothing but love for Mike Tyson, a lot of respect. 
[01:45:30]  I'm sorry that he did himself in like he did because it was what they call immolition, you know what I mean,  and so it was a thing that we had to deal with.  But, hey, I wish him well, whatever he does.  But, boy, was he a terrific fighter.  He had people coming from everywhere to see just what you're talking about, the excitement of that big punch.  That's what you're going to see Saturday night at the Garden.  The big punch is going to be prevalent.  Faith, hope, and glory, right?  Faith, hope, and glory, Saturday, and Masters for Garden.  Everybody, we want everybody in New York to come on down.  This is truly a melting pot of this great United States. 
[01:46:00]  Boxing back at the Garden.  You know, we're talking about fighters here.  Oscar De La Hoya.  Did you see the pictures?  He's just smiling.  We just shut up, Don Gink.  Wow.  That never happened.  We just figured out how to...  I've never seen you speechless in my life.  Oh, Anthony, Anthony.  You know what I mean?  And I'm just thinking about what a great show we're going to have.  And to thank Jim Dolan for that, because, you know, so many people to thank on this show. 
[01:46:30]  We couldn't have done it without Jim Dolan giving us a site.  Sure.  Or a guy named Ken Hirschman at Showtime.  He's one of the top executives in the world.  He's the head of a boxing over there in their program for Matt Blank.  He's a tremendous guy.  He's ingenious in his visionary powers to be able to bring the best to Showtime.  You know what I mean?  And let everybody know what it is.  What time is it?  And he would never wear a bikini.  No.  He's a visionary television executive. 
[01:47:00]  And Les Moonves, you should be very proud of him.  Hey, Don, if it had been De La Hoya, would they have called it the Rumble in Lane Bryant?  Well, you know, I was just thinking, you know, that we got this great, great card with Santos.  Viva Puerto Rico!  You got Daniel Santos that's taking on Jose Rivera.  He's bobbing and weaving.  He's unflappable.  He's very great.  All the Puerto Ricans in New York, we love you.  Tito Trillandet will be fighting here on January 19th.  But right now, Viva Puerto Rico! 
[01:47:30]  It's Daniel Santos and Jose Rivera.  If Oscar was on the bill, you'd have to change the name to Faith, Hope, and what is he wearing?  Well, back at that time, you know...  Faith, Hope, and Gloria.  Faith, Hope, and Gloryhole.  Oh, jeez.  Yes, well...  Well, uh...  You know, it's really great.  Don's going to run through everybody.  And the people that clean up at the garden.  You got to give them a hammy.  Clean up the...  Yes, yes.  Oh, you're right, Anthony, because, you know, he's telling you, right, you know, all the enclosed 
[01:48:00]  environment that are listening to Opie and Anthony this morning, he is telling you, right,  come on down to the garden on October the 6th on Saturday, because we need you.  We want you to be there, en masse, to demonstrate to the world that all around the world,  New York is the greatest city in the world, because they named it twice.  It's so good.  New York, New York.  And so, to Mayor Bloomberg, we want you there.  And we want to be able to thank everyone to help us to make this thing possible.  This fight is not made by me alone.  We're losing them.  This one is made by Ken Hersh from Showtime. 
[01:48:30]  We're losing them.  We're losing them.  Jim Dolan of New Orleans.  We're losing them.  We're losing them.  Isaiah Thomas.  And yes, Isaiah, a basketball player.  Oh, it's so great.  Throw the ball through the hoop, Isaiah.  Isaiah, I'm telling you, it's really wonderful.  Opie and Anthony 92, 3K, right?  Thank you so much.  Is there anybody, this is an odd question.  Love being promoted.  Yeah.  That's Jim Norton.  That's Jim Norton.  Will you please give Jim Norton the floor?  Jim Norton, please.  The fact that he remembered my name, nobody ever remembers my name. 
[01:49:00]  That makes me very happy that Don King knows my name.  Very famous.  What's in the name?  That would be called a rose band of the name with smelly sweet.  That's true.  That's true.  Remember the name.  The immortal bard.  The name is the most important.  Jim Norton, y'all.  Was there anybody you had to deal with?  I'm going to guess it might have been Mobutu.  Was there anybody you had to deal with that really made you nervous?  I mean, you have dealt with a lot of very interesting individuals being in the game you're in.  And you went to Zaire.  Some shady characters.  I mean, you made that happen in Zaire.  I mean, with a lot of their money. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, was he like the most frightening guy you ever dealt with?  No, on the contrary, he was very sophisticated.  You know, this guy had been educated, I guess, up there in Oxford or Cambridge or somewhere in England.  And he come out of the bush.  You know what I mean?  But he was a very talented young man.  And he had great oratory capabilities.  And he was a delight because he loved Muhammad Ali and he wanted to have this done.  But a guy named Manduga Bula is the one who really was the interceder between us. 
[01:50:00]  And he would work with us and tell us how to work with Mobutu Sese Seko.  His name was Joseph Desiree Mobutu.  And he was from the Belgian Congo.  So he wanted to take his country back, crying out for freedom, just like we do or everyone else is.  And so he had to organize all of these Nigerians.  Not Jadans.  I mean, Zawarans or whatever they are.  So he had to be able to talk to them and get them together.  And he did.  Then he went back to the native Joseph.  He dropped the name of Joseph Desiree Mobutu and took on Mobutu Sese Seko. 
[01:50:30]  You know what I mean?  So then everybody had to do the indigenous names that had to speak their language.  He gave them a sense of pride and dignity that was hitherto for not done over there.  Is it true that he actually, the story on When We Were Kings, that he rounded up all the criminals to make Zaire safe  and was randomly having prisoners killed to let you know that you're connected?  I mean, was that true or is that just the stuff?  Well, I don't know, but he did, you know, we had a crime dropping, I mean, what they call a crime rate. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  It dropped precipitously.  Okay, well.  You know what I mean?  So everybody was good, man.  Everybody was safe, you know what I mean?  Because he wanted the news to go out that Zaire was it, you know what I mean?  Yeah, that's a great movie.  And we had a movie, we had a reporter, her name was Chimpupu Wa Chimpupu.  And he would do all kinds of stuff, man, you know what I mean?  Chimpupu Wa Chimpupu.  He would, you know, censor the press.  He would send guys, he sent them over to Iceland somewhere on the way coming into Zaire. 
[01:51:30]  But he was a good guy, you know what I mean?  But he just didn't understand that you don't censor, you know, you do things straight out and report the news.  But just, again, it shows the example of how great the America is.  Right on, damn.  Support our troops, support our troops.  You've been with some interesting people.  You've had people accuse you of some very unsavory things in boxing.  Absolutely.  And I could tell just by listening to you and watching you, you never are going to out-talk Don King on a point.  It's just not going to happen.  You're amazing.  But they're always accusing you of stealing from boxers and hurting boxers. 
[01:52:00]  And what is your typical response to that?  Well, you know what, you know, you've got to always understand that you have to do like Jesus.  And he says he would out-seeing let him cast the first stone.  Judge not yet, you be judge, you know.  You know what I mean?  So in Matthew 7, 12, it says, do unto others as you would have them to do unto you.  You know, whenever you're good at whatever you do, you're always going to be accused.  The higher you go up, those who will stand on the line and do nothing, they don't want to get into the game.  They don't want to get into the chance of losing, the goal against the chance of winning. 
[01:52:30]  They don't want to take risks.  That's what I'm trying to say.  So what if you take risks and you succeed, then you're going to have people that's going to be jealous.  You know what I mean?  And I think it was Shakespeare that said, trifles light as air to the jealous, confirmation as strong as holy writ.  You know what I mean?  So you've got to understand that whatever they say, I'm still standing.  You know what I mean?  Now you've got to understand.  That's the bottom line, Anthony and Opie.  Listen, the CIA, the IRS, Interpol, you know what I mean? 
[01:53:00]  The FBI, the Polish departments.  Do you know with all the accusations that they have made against me, the allegations that they have made against me, you know, that if any of them were true, I wouldn't be sitting here on 92.3.  Oh, God, here we go.  You know what I mean?  I'd be busting rocks in that thing there.  So you've got to take it like it is.  You can't have it.  You've got to take the bitter with the sweet.  You know, I love the life I live, and I live the life I love.  You've got to say what you mean and mean what you say.  The paths of the righteous man are by sect on all sides. 
[01:53:30]  Hallelujah.  So you haven't seen the Oscar De La Hoya pictures, and you've never fixed a fight.  That's what you're saying today, right?  I can't say that I haven't seen some photographs of them.  All right.  Because Oscar's always been fighting for me.  But fix the fight, never.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Because you don't get no chance on that at all.  You know what I mean?  They would love to catch me doing anything.  I'm saying I'm accused of the Johnstown flood, the World War II, you know what I mean, Lindbergh kidnapping, you know what I mean, the Brink's job. 
[01:54:00]  Whatever it is that they can find, they will label it on me so I have a Pope-like quality of absolving that.  Now, years ago, though, you were accused, I even think convicted, of manslaughter.  Yes, I was.  You know what I mean?  Unfortunately, it was the frustrations of the ghetto expressing themselves, and I happened to get the misfortune of being instrumental in the fatality of a fellow human being.  I think that is something I've suffered deep contrition for, and to expiate for your sins, you've got to keep giving. 
[01:54:30]  You've got to keep working.  You know, if you have faith, you can cast your bread upon the water, and you'll get back cashed.  Does that still bother you, like, as a person?  If you don't have faith, you get back soggy bread.  On a daily basis, though, does that bother you?  It doesn't bother me as much as, you know, once you recognize and appreciate the fact that, you know, that you're not God, and, you know, you could be God-like in dealing with people.  You've got to be able to deal with what is real, and then you've got to justify it in an irrational, rational, whichever way you want to put it, when you didn't start it or whatever it is. 
[01:55:00]  But, you know, it's a thought, Anthony.  You know what I mean?  And you can never just really wash it away.  You've got to go out and try to do good for others, you know what I mean?  But contributing and giving, you know what I mean?  Make up for it in other ways.  Hey, how did it, but to get serious for a second, how did it feel to kill a man?  Well, you know what?  It's not a feeling of what you're going to do for a killer.  Just like when you say on Iwo Jima, how would you tell the guys over there with Batan, Corregidor, you know what I mean?  When you find people that are fighting, you know, it's the way that you look at a life and what she is, because it's three words. 
[01:55:30]  It's eros, philia, and agape.  That's the Greek words.  Eros is an affectionate love.  You know, philia is like a brother-in-law, you know what I mean, a family love, whatever.  And agape is the love of the human personality.  I may love you because you're a human being, but I may not like your ways.  Your ways may be disdain.  It may be something that would be not appropriate, you know what I mean?  But you still got to be respected for being a human personality. 
[01:56:00]  And so I think that I love all the people, you know what I mean?  And it's what John Donne said many years ago, that no man's an island in time to himself.  Every man is a member of the continent and a part of the main.  So therefore, do not sin for who the bell tolls.  The bell tolls for thee.  You know what I mean?  Yes, you know what I mean?  So I got to believe in John.  He said, every man's death diminishes me.  I'm involved with mankind.  So it felt good.  You were 13 years old.  Opie, baby!  Yeah, Opie, go, Jim, go.  Damn. 
[01:56:30]  This is, and I...  I don't want to be your third kill.  We're all right, right?  Yeah, you're all right, man.  You're all right.  The first time...  Oh, ye of little faith, get thee behind me, Satan.  A guy tried to rob one of your places, and it was ruled to justify our Bahamas side.  You were defending your place of business.  Yes.  And I think that's one thing is the reputation has gotten out.  Don King doesn't play.  Yeah.  Don't screw around with Don King.  Just deal with him in a certain way, and you'll be fine.  Don't?  Well, it could get ugly.  Well, you know, you got to think about John Paul Jones, and I think about him quite often. 
[01:57:00]  When his John Paul Jones ship was sinking and the water was over the portholes, and the  British commander yelled out to John Paul Jones, do you surrender?  Do you surrender?  And John Paul Jones retorted, I have not yet began to fight.  You know what I mean?  So you got to keep fighting for this great nation called America, and that's what I do.  You know what I mean?  Because this is the greatest country in the world, regardless of the many iniquities and  injustices that we have to suffer, and there are many.  You know what I mean?  But the fact of the matter is you must challenge America to be, to rise up to what it could 
[01:57:30]  be, one land, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, endowed by their  creator with certain inalienable rights among these, which are life, but the difference  is happening.  Well, the thief got to live, too.  He's got to understand, too.  You know what I mean?  Now, it's just a part of what he's stealing for.  Is he stealing to feed his family?  Right.  Or is he just stealing to take Opie's money?  You know what I mean?  It's a different thing.  Now, Opie has so much, he should share it.  I couldn't agree more.  Yeah.  All right, Doug, what we've been saying for years, Don. 
[01:58:00]  Not as a square garden, October 6th.  Yeah, the big plug.  We've got to take a break here.  Yes, Saturday night.  Let's hear the great Don King.  Don't take a break, but don't touch that dog, or we'll be right back.  Daddy 2-3-K rock.  And with Opie and Anthony.  But right now, the garden is in command.  Jim Dolan is calling on you.  Don King is calling on you.  Ken Hirschman is calling on you.  And America, Matt, Bloomberg, and everyone else, we are saying, this is the greatest city in the world.  Let's demonstrate that to friend and four alike around the world, so when the cameras hit you, everybody will be seen, and everybody is important.  We all are stars. 
[01:58:30]  So let's be a star at faith, hope, and glory.  October 6th, this Saturday, at Madison Square.  Very cool.  And Don, take us to break by doing a promo for the Opie and Anthony show, and the great Jim Norton.  Oh, yes.  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to take a break now, and Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, that's our coming.  He's going to keep you smiling.  And we want you to be right there when we come back, so don't touch that dog.  We'll be right back.  This is Aron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion. 
[01:59:00]  Pleasure for me today, Anthony and Opie, bring me here to New York, to I say hello to all my wrestling fans, and everybody know.  I'm the real Middle Eastern man, come to the greatest wrestling country, and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American, and also my Iranian friend. 
[01:59:30]  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to I talk to the Opie and Anthony, and pleasure for me always.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We want to play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  If you got one, 877-212-ON-A.  Kevin from Connecticut is just amazed by our Don King interview. 
[02:00:00]  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, six of the biggest balls in history.  Kevin from Connecticut, wait, did you just ask Don King how it felt to kill a man?  And did he answer you?  We're going to have to go through the tapes and see what he said.  Yeah, we're going to have to replay that maybe tomorrow or something.  Decipher it.  And figure out what questions he actually answered during that interview.  He's an amazing guy, man.  And I'm going to give the fight another plug.  It's this Saturday, October 6th at Madison Square Garden. 
[02:00:30]  Samuel Peter against Jameel McCline.  And, man, King always puts on amazing fights.  Yeah.  He has a history of putting on great, great fights.  Screw that.  He was just a great guest.  I like how he summed it up by saying, you know, all that stuff.  And he goes, hey, I'm still standing.  Yeah.  So regardless of what people accuse him of, what he has done.  That guy can take a punch right there.  Yeah.  That guy's been.  And true, like the FBI, the CIA, I don't doubt.  He was bragging about it.  He goes, look, they all looked into me.  They're trying to get him. 
[02:01:00]  I'm still standing.  They're trying to nail him.  And he's still standing.  So my favorite part of the interview is when we asked him about the Oscar De La Hoya pictures.  And he just sat there and smiled and smiled.  He was speechless for a couple of seconds.  Oh, yes.  I have an update.  Because I just walked Mr. King to his car.  Yeah.  And his comment about you guys, he goes, you got to keep it real with them because they bring it.  All right.  Yeah.  I like how you put the inflection on that too, Kenny.  Exactly.  I'm down with that.  Of course you are.  Down with syndrome. 
[02:01:30]  So you are.  I would love to see, next time, I would love to have him in again.  I want to see Don King talking up Kenny.  Oh.  I want to see Don King singing.  Good luck.  He probably would.  And Kenny.  Speechless.  Again, like when you asked him the Oscar De La Hoya question.  Wow, man.  He sat there.  That was fun.  He smiled.  And it was the first time I ever saw he had nothing to say.  Well, I don't know what his relationship to Oscar is, if it's good or bad, so I don't know  what he meant.  You know what?  But I got around that because then I'm like, all right, what you're saying is you've never seen 
[02:02:00]  Oscar De La Hoya pictures, and you've never fixed a fight.  And that's when he said, whoa, all right, hold on.  Whoa, whoa.  I may have seen some pictures, but.  I never fixed a fight.  But I never fixed a fight.  He's seen them.  He probably laughed his ass off.  Oh, come on.  Are you kidding me?  You could tell he saw them.  As soon as we asked a question, he was giggling like a little girl.  He probably shipped them lingerie anonymously.  It's like, ooh.  Right.  And we have Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Where's George?  Once again, I left him at home.  Sorry.  No, it's not.  He's ditching George at home these days. 
[02:02:30]  That's good.  It's time to kick that punk to the curb.  I know.  I'm doing a single.  Yeah.  It's radio.  Yeah.  What are you playing, Otto?  Caroline's tonight here in New York City.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  I have a little skit tonight at Caroline's.  You can follow Don King.  2 on 2.  Horrible.  Hold on.  2 on 2, 757-4100.  You're doing an interesting thing.  You're hosting.  It's kind of like your show, and you're putting on other comedians like Rick Shapiro.  Otto and George presents a night of stand-up.  All kinds of different characters.  If it's titled that, I'm going to bite your face. 
[02:03:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Otto and George presents, colon.  Who's on the show with you?  Shapiro?  Shapiro, that big Jake Oakerson, Johnny.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Big J.  Big J.  Johnny O.  And then some guy named Shuley or something like that.  Shuley.  Okay.  Shuley's a guy that sterns on his board.  He's a good guy.  All right, cool.  Tonight at Caroline's, 10 o'clock with Otto and George.  You were listening to the Don King interview.  What a great interview.  It was fun to listen to, huh?  Yeah.  Look, we're all pumped.  Yeah.  And I was nervous, man.  I'll be honest.  We try to be honest with this radio show. 
[02:03:30]  We meet a lot of famous people.  Yeah.  For the most part, it's cool, but you're not nervous.  He walked in.  I'm like, I didn't know what mic to turn on all of a sudden.  He's an intimidating guy.  Because you know who he sat with.  It's like when you watch when we were king.  He, as comfortable as he was just talking to us, he was that comfortable talking to Ali  and Foreman.  I know.  The most famous man on the planet.  He's a guy who's not intimidated.  You know what I mean?  It's like, so you kind of know that you're dealing with a guy who's, what are you going  to do?  Wow.  Yeah.  He's amazing.  Yeah.  Really interesting guy.  Does he manage boxes or he just promotes? 
[02:04:00]  Promote.  He's a promoter, man.  Really?  He's a talking machine.  He can promote anything.  He makes me want to see that fight.  And I don't know who these guys are.  Really?  And I want to see the fight.  Yeah.  I want to listen to this radio show after he promoted it like that.  I know, boys.  People are going to be let down.  Right.  Keep it real.  If he had heard this show before he came here today, he never would have done it.  Oh, never would have come in here.  He would have destroyed his reputation.  He would talk us all up and people would listen and it's a snooze fest.  I want to see him go to Cleveland and promote that awful Maxwell show.  Oh, God.  And the man doesn't even talk in his real voice.  This Maxwell, he has a funny sidekick. 
[02:04:30]  And punt.  And punt.  What is that?  That awful Cleveland guy.  It's a catchphrase.  He's got it on a t-shirt.  I had fat shows in radio.  That was funny.  Oh, they're just all.  You guys know.  You guys go on the radio tours and you sit down in front of these pigs.  I was ready to curse and then I looked at the clock.  I can't speak for every fat guy out there.  Yeah.  But I can tell you as far as radio goes and fat guys go, they're like filling up an emptiness  and insecurity.  Yeah.  Most radio guys really insecure. 
[02:05:00]  Use drugs.  The love of God.  They feed that emptiness with donuts and just overdo it with the booze and everything else.  Because you can't be seen on the radio, you don't have to be in an abysmal sight in real life,  you know?  It's true.  God damn blimps.  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  It's like you don't have to comb your hair if you're on the radio.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't comb your hair.  Packing their faces.  Yeah.  I know.  Getting hookers and pornography.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's something.  Yeah.  Yeah, but at least you addressed that.  These guys are hiding behind all their issues. 
[02:05:30]  I got to say, Kenny Michaels is a great driver.  We were making some time from the Lincoln Tunnel to here because we thought we were going to  be late and he was really making some moves.  I felt like I should be shooting at the car behind me.  Did you pat his shoulder and say, nice work, Lou?  We going to Jersey?  Maybe.  I love the explanation McCluskey gives for shattering his jaw.  I'm a little too old for my job.  I'm cranky.  I'm cranky.  Sorry.  I cracked you in the face as hard as I can. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Get out of here.  The hand motion.  Pissed off.  Circular hand motion.  Nothing better than a pissed McCluskey.  By the way, we got to acknowledge that it's three years ago today we got back on radio  after sitting out.  Right.  Was it three years since we've been on?  Three years ago today we did our first show back.  Wow.  Wow.  For XM.  I understand XM is celebrating.  Are they?  Yes.  We'll see what they have in store.  Oh, what do they have for us?  Wicklund's going to throw up on a counter so we can make little animal shapes out of it.  They have nothing planned for us.  You know, we were off the air for two years and three months, something like that, and 
[02:06:30]  that seemed like an eternity.  We've been back longer than we were off radio at this point.  We've been back for three years.  Isn't that amazing?  That took a lot longer.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey.  Wow.  We got a lot of what did you learn today.  We're trying to get this bit back on the show.  Let's go to Ginny.  White House Station.  Ginny, what's up?  Hey, you guys killed me at PNC.  And Jimmy, I pass your billboard every day.  Love your little belly, babe.  Thank you.  What I learned today is that Anthony's too much of a wussy to get the old snip snip. 
[02:07:00]  Come on, Anthony.  Ah, shut up, you bitch.  Hey.  I ain't gonna get it.  What?  She's talking to him.  Instead of and pun, you want to say something else?  And.  Yeah.  It's similar letters.  Love you.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, take a picture of my billboard.  The Monster Rain one on Exit 13 and email it.  Please.  I'd love to see it.  Yeah.  Otto, vasectomy, would you get it done?  No.  I'd sooner drop a storm window on my ball bed.  That's the point.  Exactly.  She's calling me a wimp and a wuss for not wanting to have a doctor stick scissors in there and 
[02:07:30]  do all kinds of work.  That area is sensitive.  Sometimes if it gets tapped, it hurts.  Oh, yeah.  You just brush.  Yeah.  You brush.  You go, oh, did it hurt?  Did it hit the right spot?  Did it?  I'm not sure yet.  I did.  Ow!  And then the pain decides to show up later.  Have the baby, drown it in the tub, and blame it on a black.  That's all.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, it is.  Otto, George.  Caroline's tonight.  That's something I heard in Boston.  That's some of the funny you'll hear tonight at Caroline's. 
[02:08:00]  But it's accurate.  Susan Smith does exactly what she did with the lake.  I mean, she's blaming it on a black guy.  It actually worked until she confessed it.  Let's go to Mongo, the trucker.  Mongo, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Don King does a great impression of Keanu Reeves in the Matrix when you ask  him a question.  Yeah, he doesn't really like answering questions, now does he?  Let's say how to Paul and Philly.  Go Phillies, by the way, Paul.  Let's go.  Yeah, I learned that Opie is definitely the kiss of death to any team he roots for.  He's really gunning for the Phillies. 
[02:08:30]  Listen, I did pretty well.  I went with the Red Sox.  They won.  Went with the Phillies.  They lost.  Went with the Cubs.  They lost.  One out of three is not bad for me.  There you go.  You're batting 666, buddy.  Yeah, but you're...  No, I'm batting 333.  Your heart is really with the Phillies.  I say Phillies all the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they're going to win the National League.  Red Sox win the American League.  Phillies win it all.  That's it.  And I'm not feeling the Cubs that much.  I'm just saying Cubs because we're in Chicago.  I'll be honest with that.  But I truly believe in the Red Sox and the Phillies this year. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Let's say hi to Rob from New Jersey.  Rob, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned today that Don King fixes his hair by sticking his head out of the airplane window.  Yeah.  That was really funny.  My stupid hair joke that I had to give.  Gabe in New York.  Gabe?  What did you learn?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Don King said the words Madison Square Garden more times than the Iron  Sheik.  Iron Sheik. 
[02:09:30]  Brendan, Boston.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  Today, I learned about the mystery of time zones.  Yeah.  I guess it's like morning here, but it's afternoon in Cleveland.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  Yeah, good afternoon, Cleveland.  Good afternoon, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Sonny Farrelli.  Sonny.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned today, how are you guys doing?  Hi.  What?  It's phone call Thursday.  Oh, Jesus.  What a waste.  Wow.  I came in second on Pest Poker on Sunday there, Sonny. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, hey.  Congratulations.  Where the hell were you?  Well, you know, I'm having some problems on the home front, but, you know, it's phone  call Thursday.  How are you guys?  Oh, shut up.  Good luck to you, Sonny.  You got to go.  Good luck, buddy.  So, Otto and George, Caroline's tonight at 10 o'clock.  You're going over to the other joint, right?  Yes.  OttoandGeorge.com.  Oh, you're doing the walkover now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we go to the other place now.  Okay.  Oh, you haven't seen that studio yet?  Well, no.  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah, it's ridiculous. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you to Don King.  It was just a great guest.  Yeah.  It really would be a great interview.  The fight, Samuel Peter, Jameel McCline, WBC Championship, this Saturday, October 6th  at the Garden here in New York.  Go to the box office or Ticketmaster and get tickets.  Nice work.  Thank you.  Nice work, Lou.  All right, we'll continue on XM.  Son of a.  Bitch.  You're not joining us over there.  Son of a bitch.  You're not joining us over there.  And punt.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[02:11:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Is that dramatic enough for you?  Wow.  All right.  Why does it sound different, the headphones?  Does it?  Because it will every day.  The first couple days in the new studio.  I'm very, very happy with everything.  And this is really bassy.  Yeah.  No?  People are going to think it's worse though, because we say this every day now.  No.  We've been.  It's always something with a headphone. 
[02:11:30]  I think.  All right.  Whatever.  How do you think?  I don't like this at all.  It's Opie and Anthony live at XM Satellite Radio.  Three years ago today, we did our first show for XM.  From right here, huh?  Well, it looks a little different.  It was Frank's place back then.  We hijacked Frank's place to do our first broadcast for XM.  And that guy, Buddy, is still holding out.  He's fucking up in that little teeny studio.  He is not leaving.  You gotta love that guy.  He refuses to go.  He refuses to go. 
[02:12:00]  He's like cancer.  He's just going to fucking stay until.  He's one of these guys.  What a nudge.  He's one of these guys that can't get the hint.  No one wants you here.  Go.  There's a place for you guys somewhere else in the city.  Go.  We're like that.  We're a tree growing around him.  Like Ant was talking about when you see signs and the tree is engulfing the sign.  Yeah, the tree eats a sign.  That's what we're doing to this guy.  And he refuses to leave.  Just stays here.  He's got a tiny little area way in the back.  No window. 
[02:12:30]  Nothing at this point.  And he won't go.  They have a brand new facility for him.  Why won't he go?  He's an odd little man.  He refuses to leave.  Fuck him.  The Oompa Loompa.  We're talking about three years on XM.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's going back.  It all started with him.  The Oompa Loompa.  That is really going back.  All right.  We've got a lot of people in studio.  Otto.  From Otto and George.  Caroline's tonight.  10 o'clock here in New York City.  Big show for Otto.  Yep.  Big show.  Big show.  212-757-4100.  And Jimmy brought a friend in. 
[02:13:00]  Eric.  My pal.  Eric McMahon, who I started with.  We've been friends for 17 years.  Long time.  You've had a friend that long?  It's fucking depressing, isn't it?  It is depressing.  We're an older gentleman now.  He's got gray hair.  It's like, I'm fucking 39.  It just sucks.  It's hard to avoid that at this point.  Is that bugging you, the 39 thing, Jim?  Yeah.  No.  Why would it?  Just try to say it obsessively?  Because it's the one before, you know.  Yeah.  What do I have to look forward to?  You know, big 40.  Big 4-0 around the corner.  I mean, how does it feel?  Well, you find that, but 39's a magical year because you find that, wow, I still can't 
[02:13:30]  maintain a relationship and it's still hard to achieve an erection unless I'm paying for  it.  Yeah.  So things are really fucking coming along well.  Fucking disgusting lack of progress I've made.  No progress?  None.  You're doing very well with yourself.  You should be very proud and very happy at where you are in your life.  Work is fun.  But Jimmy desires a very healthy relationship.  Yeah.  He really does.  Jimmy really wants a very healthy relationship. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, well, everyone wants something that they don't have at some point in their life.  But that's what he's been working on.  When you hit 40, I know, I thought back when I was like in my teens to what 40 would be  like, my impression of 40.  And it wasn't this.  You thought it was really old.  Then you realize to the people that are the age you were when you were thinking it, you  are fucking old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of a, yeah.  It is definitely, it's worse than 30 was as far as crossing the 30 threshold. 
[02:14:30]  40 is like parents' age.  Like when you became, you think of your parents' age.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't want, I was really bad.  I didn't want to fucking go from 12 to 13.  13 bugged me.  I wanted to like be 12 because once you're a teen, then you were like getting older.  I wanted to like Peter Pan.  I wanted to be like Peter Pan.  You know, wear tight.  Yeah.  Suck a dick.  Yeah.  Why not?  Nothing wrong with that.  It's not gay if you're wearing green. 
[02:15:00]  That's such a problem.  People have issues with turning older, man.  I, I, I'm a little weirded out by it.  My, I, I, I pointed out a lot when I talk like I'm 39, I'm 39.  It's like, I guess 40 is a little bit fucking.  Florentine told me a story, um, that, that he was hitting on some chick and she was like  24.  And she said to Jim, like, how old are you?  And he, and he's like, uh, whatever he is, 42.  And then she's like, well, what interest would you have in me?  I'm 24.  Wow.  What interest is this, this, an easy answer to that one.  Yeah.  I noticed the other day when I was going into a Starbucks, I'm getting coffee for my, uh, 
[02:15:30]  my girlfriend.  And, um, I didn't, there were, there was a gaggle of, of younger girls sitting there and I didn't  give a shit how I walked or what I was wearing or looking at like that used to make me so self  conscious walking into a place and there were some chicks there and I'd be like, Oh God,  are they going to say something?  They talking about me or something, you know?  They're making fun of me or whatever the fuck it was like something.  And I realized I don't give a shit what they think. 
[02:16:00]  And I think that, and then I wasn't sure if it was age or the fact that I'm famous and  I have more money.  I could get more bitches than I can fucking, you know, juggle.  I'm teasing of course, but it was, it was like that we have contact with so many people  or if I just don't care anymore.  It's, it's a combination of things.  Or if I'm in a relationship, you know, I've been in a relationship for years.  You don't care about anything really.  So I mean, I really am a careless, Jesus, a non-caring fucking ass.  Do you really want us to answer this?  I don't think you care about anything. 
[02:16:30]  I care about one thing.  Me.  We get it.  Me.  No, you know, Anthony is nicer than people think.  You see Anthony's little sweet moments come out.  It sounds queer, but Anthony's nice too.  He doesn't like showing a sweet moment.  I'm selfish with my like time with me.  I'm very generous when it comes to other shit.  I know that.  I like, I like having a good time.  I like other people having fun.  Things like that.  I love footing the bill for things like that.  People having fun.  But when it comes to like, I, if I just want to do something, I want to fucking do it. 
[02:17:00]  I don't care who thinks what.  If I just want to sit and fucking fuck on the, around with the computer for 10 hours straight.  That's what I want to do.  That's what I want to do.  I don't want to get something.  I don't want to clean something up.  I don't want to do.  That's why the marriage like went to shit.  Yeah.  That was one of many reasons.  Well, yeah.  To love, honor, and step over when she's loaded.  Don't beat, don't, don't beat yourself up on that one. 
[02:17:30]  No, no.  Believe me, I'm not.  That's not the reason why that marriage went by by.  Chores, you know, you're famous.  You don't do chores, right?  Do chores.  Did you have interns in your private life or is it just for the radio?  I should.  I should.  Bring them on.  I do.  I call them Mexicans.  Club Soda Kenny.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Kenny is definitely, uh.  He's basically licking my stamps at this point.  Kenny's like the Terminator, though.  Like, he'll just stand outside your door and kind of like stand sleep until you need him.  He's just a fucking.  He's on standby. 
[02:18:00]  He's a lumbering presence.  There are times.  I'm so lumbering.  Like, you know, I bought a new place and there's a lot of things that need to be done.  So I asked Kenny to, you know, watch the workers because I need to take a nap.  It's lame.  So I come home from work and I need to take my nappy.  Yeah.  And Kenny will stand there like a creep for hours.  And I'll come out after sleeping for two hours.  He's still standing in the same place.  I'm going off Jim's thought here because it is true.  Wow.  And I go, Kenny, you could sit down.  No, no, that wouldn't be professional. 
[02:18:30]  Wow.  And he just stands like a ghoul and overlooks what's going on in the apartment for hours  on end.  God.  And then I go, can I get your lunch?  No.  I'll eat after I'm done here, G.H.  G.H.  Hmm.  So.  It's creepy.  Hey, uh.  Lacky.  Did we get this from Wackbag?  I don't want message boards pissed off at us if it's more than one, but it sounds like  this is from Wackbag.  Why?  Are there any others?  Wackbag?  I don't even know.  You only can.  There's a few others that are.  Oh, yeah.  That are helping out the show.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[02:19:00]  I know.  Pop-lone AIDS?  I know of one.  Wackbag.  That's all I know.  Look, I'm putting up my Wackbag.  It's my Wackbag signal.  That's what they do.  It's gang signs for a fucking message board.  Shoot me somebody.  They really?  Yeah.  Did they actually put up a W?  That's what Snoop does.  Yeah, and that's the bad one.  What about frunkus.net?  I don't know about that one.  Steve does a good job.  I don't know this website.  I don't know what he does.  Isn't that like a Star Trek?  Is that almost like this?  No, that's a Vulcan.  Oh, that's a Vulcan.  Live long and prosper.  Live long and die screaming. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, and this is artificial pussy, but it takes two people to make.  Yeah, yeah.  And you put the hands together.  What is the one for live long and then wait five minutes to call EMS while she's fucking  at the bottom of the pool?  Which one is that?  Scotty, he pulled out his old prop communicator to call Bones.  Bones, my wife is in the pool.  Bones, doesn't work.  She's drowning.  Last bubble comes up.  Yeah.  He decides to get the phone.  Well, we got, what did we learn?  The three-year anniversary from Wank Bag. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, wow.  They've been doing this for the last, what, week or so, and we got some of the better ones.  Danny compiled the list here.  So if we read yours, pat yourself on the back, you made the list.  There you go.  What did we learn since we started?  Back at XM, anyway.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did we learn?  The three-year anniversary edition.  Jimmy is now a best-selling author.  Yes.  How is happy ending, though?  It was good.  It was five weeks on the list.  I mean, I think it's still doing okay. 
[02:20:30]  What happens in that world, though?  Then it just goes away?  Yeah, there's only 10.  There's like an X amount of spots on the 15 on the printed list.  It just goes away.  But you get pushed out.  I don't mean the best-seller list.  I'm just talking in general with the book.  Is it one of the – I don't know.  Oh, I don't know either.  Like, does a book sell real well for three or four weeks, and then it drastically drops  off, and then kind of people buy it here and there?  You balance out.  How does that work?  It depends on the support you have.  Like, I had the radio station.  I had a lot of the stuff that we did.  But I'm never going to get the support of, like, a Reader's Digest or Oprah.  There's continual pushes that will happen for a guy like Tony Dungy's book or whatever, 
[02:21:00]  you know, first black coach to win a Super Bowl.  So there's other things that will push him.  But I sold very well, and now it will just kind of even out.  Where in the bookstore is that found under comedy or humor?  In some places, it was actually in the front when you walk in, and in some places, it's  always in humor.  It's in the humor section.  Yeah, but it was in the new section, too, when you first walk in.  They get a good placement in Barnes & Noble.  Yeah, cool.  It's in every airport I've been in in the past six months.  Is it really?  Oh, it's ridiculous, yeah.  Oh, I didn't know.  No, it's right there in the middle, and they've got it all – you know, all those are 
[02:21:30]  turned sideways.  You can just see the jacket on the side.  Yours is right there laying there, happy endings.  That's disgusting.  And, Eric, you've been Jimmy's friend for 17 years.  How much does that bother you?  Let's be honest.  It was what he said about me in the book, Ope.  I know you're happy for him, but – wait, what did you say about him in the book?  I love Eric.  I said – something about – what did I say about him?  I have a doubt.  He's a nice man and a good father and a good parent, but he's a cross between John Ashcroft  and Robert Mapplethorpe, and I see him digitally raping a hitchhiker at some point. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, because – because Eric is a fucking – Eric's a very responsible, like, good guy.  He's a conservative dude, but he's a sociopath.  Like, he's a guy with that – he's like a guy that has that fucking absolute snap temper  rage, and you'd never know where to look at him.  He looks like such a gentleman, but –  No, he looks like he could star in a Lifetime movie about a guy that meets a woman and everything's  fine until he just starts punching her in the eyes, and the girlfriends have to figure 
[02:22:30]  out some way to kill him.  That's my initial impression.  Starring Markie Post.  You know what?  You know what about that book, though?  It's like all those little things that he talked about, you know, the boogers and everything  and all the – like, he wipes himself and rubs smells it, you know?  Yeah.  We went together to Voss's – when Voss first taped the HBO thing on Def Jam.  He was the first white guy to be on Def Jam.  Oh, my God.  Me and you did go to that theater.  We were in the balcony together with the only two white people.  You let everyone know that, too.  I was the first one.  Yeah, we know.  Voss is great at getting you in the balcony of things.  He fucking sucks. 
[02:23:00]  It's amazing.  It's the worst.  Dude, the Donald Trump roast, it's got to be brought up again.  Yeah.  And we'll get back to your story.  This is what we do on the show.  You'll learn.  That's all right.  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  He invites – and I – you were on the dais?  No, we were –  No, no.  I was with you guys.  And you were with us, too.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Yeah, Rich Voss is on the dais with the Donald Trump roast, and he's going to do some time,  and he wants to invite his friends.  And we were quite flattered.  He's like, I want you guys there when I roast Donald Trump.  So we get there, and we see everybody just filing into the joint.  Into the huge banquet hall. 
[02:23:30]  Like, this banquet hall could easily fit 1,000 people.  It's key to the story.  This place was massive.  Big hill in New York.  And everyone's just going straight to the tables that are on the floor in front of the stage.  We're just following the crowd like, this is really cool, you know?  We're going to meet a lot of celebrities, and we get to see our pal up close, like, roasting  Donald Trump.  Ticket guy goes, you guys are that way.  We're like, oh, okay.  We're probably on the other side of this massive banquet hall.  No, he was pointing to the elevators.  Yeah.  Oh, you're up there. 
[02:24:00]  We were up in the balcony.  I saw the pictures recently.  Donald Trump looked this big.  I know I'm making a visual, but you could barely tell it was him.  And not only was it shitty seats in the balcony, but we were behind the big screen TV that they  put up.  So we had to look over the top of that.  The obstructed view.  Yeah, completely obstructed view.  Voss is just useless.  So getting back to you guys, you're in the balcony.  So I'm in the balcony, and we're waiting for Voss to go on.  And it was on the, toward the end of the show. 
[02:24:30]  And Norton, of course, is nervously fingering his belly button and smelling it the whole  time.  We're waiting to do it.  So he's like, you know, the whole time, want to whiff, want to whiff.  And I'm like, no, get that away from me.  And then just before Voss is about to go on, he's got his finger and he goes, come on,  you got to take a whiff for good luck for Voss.  Do it for Voss.  And I go, I almost passed out.  I finally got him.  I guilted him into doing it.  So our fucking Jewish friend didn't get murdered by the fucking 2,000 blacks in the crowd.  And neither did we.  It was all obvious who we were there to see.  Dude, one of my favorite times hanging out with all the comedians was Rich Voss and a 
[02:25:00]  bunch of us in a parking lot at a train station.  So I was getting back on a train and we went around the circle smelling Rich Voss's, the  shit that's behind his ear.  The ear stuff, right, yeah.  And two guys puked.  And it was one after another.  We all took a hit.  And it was some of the funniest stuff ever.  Like this, like a salty discharge behind his ear?  Oh, you don't know?  He's got a cyst that kind of oozes and leaks.  Get out of here.  He had it taken out, though.  He had it taken out recently.  Right.  But he rubs it.  And it really is like, it's a weird stench that in nature, it repels you. 
[02:25:30]  You back up instinctively.  It's not even your...  It's dying bacteria.  Yeah.  It's like, it's an infection.  But I've seen people fall to the ground and then everyone else around just, you're laughing  so hard it hurts.  It is the worst.  And I forgot who puked.  I think it might have been Adam Farrar or somebody, but they were puking and dry heaving over  the last thing.  Remember that day you had a fucking serious unit?  You were still talking about doing a serious exam.  It was way back and it was really depressing times, man.  And boss's ear did not fucking help.  No. 
[02:26:00]  What a way to end a depressing day.  All right.  What did we learn?  Three-year anniversary.  Opie got engaged along with some other guy from the show.  Oh, right.  Blew up his spot bad that day.  Travis is a married woman and has a cat named Jack Jack, whom was given to him by Steve from  Bayshore.  People know that?  Jeez.  Bunch of busy body, nosy people.  Did they learn anything before September?  I know.  What is it?  This is all new stuff.  Yeah, but this is like our staff when they're picking the line of the day. 
[02:26:30]  They just go through the last half hour.  Last 15 minutes of the radio show.  It's easier that way.  The Than and Sam show is successful-ish.  What did we learn through your anniversary edition?  Dane discovered chocolate rain, but the world will never know.  Really?  I think so.  Danny brought chocolate rain to our show, and then it became-  Yeah, then it kind of took off.  It kind of took off from there, but I think we were the first media outlet that started  playing chocolate rain.  Oh, good train.  Rich Voss is a father again. 
[02:27:00]  What do you think about that, Eric?  You've known Rich for a while.  That's ridiculous.  I think Bonnie just totally whipped him into doing that.  I couldn't imagine having two kids that were all grown up out of diapers and all that, and  just going back to that.  What is he?  He's almost 50.  He's over 50.  He's over 50.  He's going to celebrate his 50th this summer in Connecticut, Mohegan Sun.  He's in love.  He's in love with graduation for the kid, and if he's alive, he'll be 70.  You know, just sitting there going, that's my, that's my baby. 
[02:27:30]  He'll be the same age as everybody else's grandparents.  Yeah, the grandparents will be there.  It's like, oh, so are you very happy about your grandson?  Oh, yeah, real happy.  As his teeth fall out.  But 70's not that old.  Do you hang out with any 70-year-olds?  70's not that old anymore.  All right, look.  I understand the 40 thing was the earlier.  I'm serious, though.  I'm saying 40, that's one thing, but 70.  We could take a million phone calls.  70's not that.  My dad had awful, awful health problems, and even at 74, he didn't. 
[02:28:00]  He didn't seem like he was 74 years old.  70's, you ain't a spry guy, jumping around and running.  What about your mom?  My mom's a...  She's not 70, but she's...  She should be 70, like, in 2009.  So she's...  But she's a gym rat.  Dude, I...  She's the exception to the rules.  I saw her doing karaoke and dancing for four straight hours.  She's a lunatic.  And I think she does coke.  It's still too late.  It's too late to be picking your kids up at high school parties. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  You just...  And he'll just be like an old Jew.  Hey, hey, where's my...  Let me see your report card.  Did you get promoted?  Like using old school language.  Did you get A's?  No, it's graded on a numeric system.  That way we don't really get A's.  What?  Did you pass?  How was your decorum?  Yeah.  What?  Did you get notes?  There's no parking. 
[02:29:00]  There's no parking.  Would you prefer him to be an old Scandinavian at 70?  Old Scandinavian.  Max von Sydow all of a sudden?  I'd prefer him to not make it that far.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Yeah.  Moving on with the list here.  Patrice goes to bat for the boys on Fox.  Yeah.  All these are like only a couple months old.  and makes an angry pirate joke.  One of the greatest clips.  One of the greatest Opie and Anthony clips.  Check it out on YouTube.  The pack was formed and fans will band together to help the show. 
[02:29:30]  Derek only spoke on air once this year.  How do they know that?  Wow.  The traveling virus was a success.  This is what we learned from the last three years.  Jeez, from the last three friggin' months.  Officially, the ONA show won Duty Wars.  Cock meat.  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat.  He said,  well, how about bringing up like interoculars?  Oh, wow.  Interoculars, right? 
[02:30:00]  And the, uh,  I'm absolutely crying over here.  What was his name?  Can we play some of that shit today?  Bruce.  Bruce.  Bruce Kelly.  Can you find one?  Bruce Kelly.  Bring up a Bruce.  Bruce Kelly's a crybaby.  That's my,  what did we learn for three years.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to play some of that.  Get an interocular.  Okay.  Get an example of an interocular.  I want to get his,  get his who stuff where he starts crying.  Yeah.  Cause he saw the who live.  Yeah.  What a douche.  It's a blithering idiot making everybody uncomfortable.  They ask him,  he's one of the jocks that used to work at XM.  I liked the guy.  He was great. 
[02:30:30]  I like him too,  but he's a douche.  If you go,  if you go and see the who,  he's at a,  yeah,  he's worked at XM.  He's a jock and they send him off to see the who.  And he comes back to the other jocks that are sitting there and they ask him,  Hey,  how was it?  And he goes,  well,  I saw the who.  It was absolutely amazing.  And he's crying.  I'm getting emotional here.  It's the who.  Shut up.  Well,  do we have that?  We might as well play it as we're referencing it.  All right.  He's fantastic.  Opie and E-Rock learn nothing from Anthony's divorce stories. 
[02:31:00]  Well,  apparently not.  Well,  hopefully you do.  What did we learn?  Three year anniversary.  Thank you,  Kenny.  Brought me a smoothie.  Kenny,  I forgot they were bringing us food today.  But I got you a little snack.  Oh,  but look at the big buffet that Don Wicklin got us today.  Oh,  XM and Hard Rock.  XM and Hard Rock.  Don't give Don Wicklin credit where it's not deserved.  XM and Hard Rock.  I think Don hates me at this point. 
[02:31:30]  Why?  Because I goof on him a lot and it's really harsh.  He doesn't smile at me much anymore.  I said that for XM.  I think he just walks around with a stick with a point on it,  picking up paper around the parking lot.  I don't think he liked that.  All right.  Here's Bruce Kelly crying after seeing the hoe.  This is amazing.  Go ahead,  E-Rock.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know,  the whole moment just kind of,  kind of got to me with that video. 
[02:32:00]  What does he have?  A vagina?  Douche.  This is no fake.  He even used a little boy's terminology.  No fake.  No fake.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Yeah.  Why would you fake that you're crying at the hoe?  And then you go,  ha ha,  I fooled you.  Yeah.  What?  I got to hear that again.  Is there another clip too?  Or is that the other one?  Yeah.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Yeah.  Play the longer version.  Ooh.  Because then he tries to explain why he's crying and he just buries himself.  What?  Fucking Bob O'Reilly playing?  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[02:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  Please.  Mm-hmm.  Please.  The sound of me drinking a smoothie makes for great radio.  Hmm.  What'd you get?  Egg whites?  Egg whites, yeah.  Ugh.  All right.  Egg whites smell like fucking farts.  I, I, honest to God, cut a thousand farts yesterday.  My girlfriend was fucking disgusted.  And I was wealthy.  No fake.  Oh, no fake?  Ugh.  Shooter.  All right, listen, uh, we got the short clip.  That's all we got today.  Let's play, let's play that again.  Let me hear them. 
[02:33:00]  We're gonna get into that live.  Or not.  What happened?  Clusterfuck.  Eric, what are you doing?  Clusterfuck.  E-Rock.  Are you eating potato salad off of the disc?  Well, thanks, it's all set.  All right, let's play it.  I, I'm sorry.  I'm, I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  I, you know, the whole moment just kind of, uh, um, kind of got to me with that video. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, that video.  That video.  Oh.  Oh.  Tub girl.  I think it was a montage of a girl.  All right.  Jimmy.  Well, I'm not gonna beat that, so enjoy that.  Uh, let's see, what else?  Uh, never, oh, okay, what did we learn?  Uh, the three-year edition here.  Never to let a creepy cold guy in your car at a rest stop.  There you go.  One of the great Patrice O'Neill stories.  Jimmy's girlfriend makes him smell her cum breath.  Yes.  Uh, Kenny and Roland are singing sensations. 
[02:34:00]  Funny you should mention that, because last night, uh, the lovely, the lovely deer got a batch.  And, uh, brushed her teeth immediately before our kiss is goodnight.  Oh.  You've taken a stand?  I have taken a stand.  Oh, wow.  I said, please don't make me kiss you like that again.  I will, but please don't make me.  It's violating.  Yeah.  You, you don't need that.  It leaves a numb taste in your mouth.  It's fucking awful.  It's awful.  Just pecking, even her lips had a weird, when you come to a girl's mind, they have a weird quality to their lips when you kiss them.  Even if they brush their teeth, it's like, blech. 
[02:34:30]  Secondhand jizz.  Mine, though.  Yeah, even though it's yours, but it's secondhand.  If I wanted it, I would fucking just kind of do a headstand and then go, oh.  Arc it right into your mouth.  I'm not sure.  Some guys want a girl to fucking take the load and then they kiss.  Yeah.  It's called snowballing.  Yeah, I watched the first.  What do you think that's like the first time?  If you're getting secondhanded, it's that repulsive.  Oh.  I'm sure it's awful.  That's really just passive aggressive on women's part.  Here, take this back.  I'm mixed with my spit. 
[02:35:00]  I don't mind the spit, but my own load, fucking.  All right.  I'm sorry.  You're eating it there.  Hey, we got the.  Egg whites.  We got the.  We got the longer who clip.  No fake?  Let's go to the longer who clip here.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under these.  So, you know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs  after all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control. 
[02:35:30]  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, that video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah.  That was.  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  But, uh, it was just very, I mean, you know, it's just the who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the who.  And that's it. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens,  too.  So, uh.  Through your tears.  Well.  Through your tears.  Two more to go here, uh, at Hyde Park, and the crowd.  You're like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this, you know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  Look.  And then they're bringing on Strawberry Alarm Clock.  I can't take this.  Right.  A John Cougar's coming out. 
[02:36:30]  How about the announcer?  It's amazing.  They can have their full spirit after all the years.  Yeah.  He's just trying to cover for this blubbering other adult.  Yeah.  That's the great, that's the great George Taylor Morris, uh, and he basically wanted to say,  get a hold of yourself.  Get a hold of yourself.  You know what I've seen in my broadcast career?  Get a hold of yourself.  And the English girl who went, through your tears.  She used to work here.  Her mother is the, uh, the weakest link lady.  That's her mother.  Yeah.  Through your tears.  Does she still work for the company? 
[02:37:00]  I don't even know.  She's sexy.  I saw her walking.  She left the company?  She should have looked at him and said, you are the weakest man.  All right.  There you go.  Um, also Matt from New York City, uh, instant feedback.  Fucking Pat Battle better be on the list.  The Pulp Fiction Pat Battle audio was hilarious.  Pat Battle, Pat Battle, Pat Battle, Pat Battle.  Can you find that, E-Rod?  I forgot about her.  All right.  What did we learn?  Newscaster.  The three-year anniversary edition.  Uh, where are we at? 
[02:37:30]  Okay, Jimmy's girlfriend makes him smell her cum breath.  Yeah, we know that.  Uh, Jimmy F'd an N.  Yes.  These are all from only a couple months ago.  These guys have, uh, problems with their memories here.  Yeah.  Uh, cat shovel baseball can be fun.  Opie hates cake so much that he needs to stomp it into the ground.  I mean, that's at least going back a little bit.  William loves to wear dresses and fingernail polish.  Uh, Steve from Bayshore is the king of instant feedback.  Ann can talk over the beep.  Opie is a nude model for Lindsay's art homework. 
[02:38:00]  Frunk.  Yeah.  That happened.  Uh, frunk is his Latin, meaning to frunk.  I hate your own.  Ann hates phone call Thursday.  This bit's a month old.  Come on.  Help.  I know.  Let's go a little older here.  When Jimmy was a boy, he told someone in the hallway at school to shut up.  Uh, Eric Logan is an alcoholic who thought, uh, Wiki was gay.  Speaking of which, we do have the alcoholic finally, uh, checking in with the show. 
[02:38:30]  Eric Logan, everyone.  Hi, Eric.  Happy anniversary, boys.  Thank you, Elo.  Thank you.  Elo?  Yes?  Uh, it has been a pleasure these three years working at XM Satellite Radio with you at the  helm, uh, of us, you know.  Uh, and I just want to thank you for the three years that we've, uh, we've had here.  No, you're welcome.  I'm glad you guys are here.  I'm glad you're in your new studio.  One, one more thing. 
[02:39:00]  Can I have Yankee playoff tickets?  Of course you can't, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  No, that was Anthony.  You outplayed.  Oh, Anthony?  Anthony.  Anthony?  Of course you can't, Anthony.  Well, thank you.  Eric, it's like you say.  I mean, I didn't believe you when you said that you're really running things and Nate comes  to you for counsel, but you really are running things and I'm, I'm glad that we  established that.  Want to go to the game too?  Yes.  All right.  Need some for Jimmy too.  And I need a total of four.  I've got some Mets playoff tickets, but I don't know who they're playing.  No, I'd need tickets for my, uh, my new favorite team, the Phillies. 
[02:39:30]  So.  Oh, the Phillies.  Yeah.  They look, they look hot last night.  I love the Phillies.  Opie's sports curse in full effect, man.  They just.  The curse is on.  And I know Opie's serious because you can't just, Opie can't just pick a team because  he wants them to lose and root for him.  He sincerely has to want them to win.  And he's kind of a two city guy now with his girlfriend coming from Philly.  So he really wants Philly to win and they're just going to lose now.  Anthony saw it when we were like getting a tour of the facility down there. 
[02:40:00]  It's amazing.  And I started looking around going, and I started even looking at buying a Phillies cap  and everything we were in the park just going, wow, this, this is a beautiful ballpark.  What a great day we were having there watching the game.  And, uh, Opie then, uh, called it, said Phillies all the way.  And it only means they will completely self-destruct and lose because you are the sports curse incarnate.  They're done.  They're done.  And once the, once the word of the curse gets out, somebody is going to like post your 
[02:40:30]  photo everywhere open.  They're going to run you out of town.  Yeah.  They will not like you.  No, they won't like you.  So I was put on hold and I was listening to everybody yelling at me, trying to find bits.  And it's like, well, I've lost all my luggage on my trip, but I don't have a charger.  And things like the show's off to a roaring start.  Seems like things are usual after three years.  Wait, you lost your, your luggage?  I lost a bag.  I had all my chargers in it.  So I had to go buy new chargers.  Where were you going?  From where to where?  Um, in, uh.  Oh, I actually did not see that one coming.  I didn't either. 
[02:41:00]  I was going to ask him about his luggage and losing it.  Is the FBI going to be interested on what's on his laptop?  Exactly.  I knew when you asked that question, you didn't care about the answer.  How could you?  You helped a bit there.  How could you?  Where's your chargers?  Where could that possibly go that has comedic value?  Right.  Unless you locked them in someone's cunt.  It's funny you should ask.  I was mouth-fucking an invalid and I dropped my luggage.  Hey, yeah.  The pet battle bid is five minutes long?  Yeah.  What?  I don't remember it being five minutes long.  Yeah, we did it with a whole bunch of clips. 
[02:41:30]  No, I know that.  But the Pulp Fiction one is five minutes long?  Well, we can throw together a compilation.  Quick talk.  Yeah, give it a try, E-Rock.  Grab that mic.  Okay.  It's also E-Rock-tober.  Right.  Well, we'll focus on that tomorrow.  We're going to focus on the anniversary today.  Believe me.  Yeah.  E-Rock, it's five minutes long?  It's a short Worst O segment, yeah.  What is it?  A whole, uh...  It's the compilation of all the pet battles.  All right, now I got it. 
[02:42:00]  Right?  I believe so, yeah.  Oh, I just want to hear the Pulp Fiction one that they're referencing, if we can find that.  All right.  All right, thanks.  What did we learn?  The three-year anniversary edition.  Bullhorn should never be used next to a news reporter.  There you go.  There's something that's a little older.  Blows their ears out and they'll threaten to sue you.  Arthur Chan should have kept us cool at least until the camera went off.  Mm-hmm.  Julie can't.  Actually, it's con.  Con.  Cock block the boys from getting Godsmack. 
[02:42:30]  Tom C. has gay taste in neckties.  Imus has a soundproof room just so he can say the N-word over and over.  And great minds think a lot.  That's all we got from the message board?  Yeah.  All right, a lot more coming in, though.  They sucked.  Yeah, they're not too good, right?  Just all new ones.  How about some older ones?  Let's say hi.  All right, got some old school.  Yeah, let's go to Dom on Long Island.  Dom, what's up?  Hey, Dom.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Just, I know that Opie's a lot braver than three black men going up against Bernie Goetz. 
[02:43:00]  And that was the only time it got hot in there.  Wow.  And you had a call in.  Yeah, that Bernie Goetz stuff was kind of scary.  I remember he ran out of the studio and he went for something in his bag and probably  realized that he wasn't carrying that day.  That was very frightening.  We ought to try to get him back.  Maybe he forgot who we are.  I'm hoping.  He was in a weird vibe, man.  He wouldn't come back.  We wanted him back.  He's a weirdo.  He's truly nuts.  That was good radio, then. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, he's completely nuts.  You know what's great about that bit is the old security footage we had of him running  out of the studio and running back in.  And I was definitely really scared.  I had no idea why he ran out of the studio.  He went to his bag.  He went to his bag.  And then he came back in empty-handed like, fuck!  I don't have it on me!  But he was going to give Opie the old, you look okay, and put two more in him.  Yeah.  Bernie Goetz on this show, though.  All right, guys.  Congratulations.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  They had him on like twice.  That was his second appearance or third appearance. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  I think we wanted to do a music show and stuff.  He brought his CDs in.  He was running for mayor.  Started smashing his CDs in front of him, but I didn't really smash them because I didn't  have the balls to do it, actually.  So I was smashing another CD.  And he thought I was smashing his CD, and he ran out of the studio to find something.  He went, you motherfucker!  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do we have the you motherfucker part?  He just wanted to organize his papers with total obsessive-compulsive disorder and talk  about swirls, vegetarianism.  Oh, what a wacko. 
[02:44:30]  And his papers had to be all in order, anything out of order, and he freaked out.  So Opie grabbed one of his CDs and switched it with another one and broke it.  So we thought Opie had broken one of his CDs that were part of his orderly world, and  he lost his mind.  Called him a motherfucker, stormed out, and we thought he was going to come back in with  a gun and shoot Opie, like he did those young gentlemen that wanted to borrow $5 from him  on the subway.  Well, he took us through the shootings one by one. 
[02:45:00]  It was chilling.  He took us through all four with complete honesty, and he said how it felt to pull the trigger.  I mean, he didn't fuck around, man.  Yeah.  Really painted a picture.  I love him.  Yeah.  You're not.  I just want to hold him.  But do me your fucking favorite.  Ow.  Because you're driving me crazy.  You're a killer.  You're a big shot.  Just kill.  You're a killer.  You fucked that battle?  What?  You fucked that battle.  How could you ask me a question like that?  By the way, who thought that was Pulp Fiction?  Yeah, who thought? 
[02:45:30]  Come on, raise a hand.  Right there.  It says Pulp Fiction.  Who labeled that?  Who thought?  Right there.  Right there.  It says it.  Right there.  What?  E-Rock.  Non-movie knowing.  E-Rock thought.  That was Pulp Fiction.  What a dope.  I hope this is better.  Do you know who I am?  I'm Bert Bertel.  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.  That's the godfather.  Close to Pulp Fiction.  You know, maybe if your wish list on Amazon didn't have little kiddie baby fucking cartoons 
[02:46:00]  on it and had movies that adults watch instead of SpongeBob SquarePants on your wish list  on Amazon.  No, no, no.  We've had Goodfellas.  We're getting there.  Pulp Fiction.  He doesn't know any man's movies.  I was reading Peter Falk's autobiography.  He was offered the role of Mo Green in Godfather 1, but he turned it down.  It wasn't a big enough part.  Really?  Idiot.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, why not? 
[02:46:30]  You don't buy me out.  I buy you out.  If you already had the glass eye, you could have shot it.  Right.  It would have been begun.  Yeah, it's true with the glass eye.  What the hell is this?  It's a study of message.  It means he sleeps with the fishes.  Who's Pat Battle?  Wow.  Pat Battle.  A pretty husky African-American reporter here in New York who we just loved her name.  We were obsessed with it. 
[02:47:00]  Because she looked like a Pat Battle.  You know, going into battle.  It was just the worst name a woman could have.  Pat Battle.  There was not an ounce of sexuality.  In her or the name.  Oh, she was awful.  May I help you?  Yes, Pat Battle.  Who?  Pat Battle.  Oh my God, this whole thing is wrong.  All right, well.  I'm real.  Wow.  Enough about Pat Battle.  All right, whatever.  Sorry.  Someone wanted that.  Must have hated that Pat Battle.  Someone wanted that request and we don't have it right now. 
[02:47:30]  Okay.  Tom B. from Maryland.  I learned Nazis get rides before.  Oh, right.  We did that bit.  Bill K. from Philly.  Hey, I learned Ralphie May saved the show.  Yep.  Back in the old days.  That was around Thanksgiving of 04.  We were back on radio a month.  And we almost got kicked off again.  And we almost blew it.  I fucked that chick in what now is Ron and Fessler's office with no condom.  She was so drunk.  She was ready to pass out. 
[02:48:00]  And I gave her a good deep dicking.  No, not the one who got fucked up.  Was she all dry?  No, she had a nice fat puss too.  Yeah?  A good deep dicking she got.  And I think I came on the floor.  Deep dicking.  Oh, God damn.  That was wonderful.  No fucking bag, no nothing on a table.  One of those girls was so wasted that she did try to leave the studio by walking out that window.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Wow.  And we had to retire the Jägermeister machine. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, that was the day the Jägermeister machine did come in here drunk.  We lost it.  And the wiffle ball bat became obsolete.  Yeah.  We weren't allowed to use that either.  Uh, Uncle Sully, Bob Kelly is still riding Dane Coats, uh, Dane's coattails.  All right.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  I learned that he could do something gay but remain 100% straight by saying no homo.  No homo.  I learned Jimmy makes the most annoying sounds.  Uh, someone from their cell phone.  I learned the art of the topless.  Uh, Justin from Hoboken. 
[02:49:00]  I learned that it only takes XM three years to build a studio for its biggest show.  So, Fast Freddy, we learned that Opie enjoys a scent of coffee when firemen visit.  Fucking dick.  Lindsey from Portland.  Uh, she learned right about now I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Danny, I learned that hornet stings to the ball bag.  Ooh.  Equals radio gold.  Equals radio gold, yeah.  Some of these are poorly written.  George in Philly, here's something I learned three years ago from ONA. 
[02:49:30]  If I hear another damn George Carlin bit, I will stab someone in the neck.  That's going back.  That's, see, that's old.  Reverend Dave, I learned that faggoty West Coast callers like to hear sketches on the air.  Oh, wow.  That's going back.  Yes.  Uh, Baron from Louisiana.  I learned no matter how cute your voice may appear and how, how kinky you are, fat and  annoying is fat and annoying.  Hmm.  They're making fun of D.D.  We love D.D.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh, Bill Kay, again, I learned Opie's great aunt likes a good deep dickin'. 
[02:50:00]  Tony from Tampa learned that Bubba is a cunt and if we don't like the show, we can wake  up with Whoopi, someone from their cell phone, I learned the correct way to install Vista from  Ant.  Yes.  Almost two million hits on YouTube.  Now they're coming in like crazy.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We got Otto and George, uh, well, Otto, George is, uh, at home.  Yeah.  He's feeling under the weather or something, right?  In the box.  I just didn't want to schlep the valise today.  I got to come back into the city later to do this fucking Caroline's, so. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, he's just asking about George.  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  Fucking fresh.  He's doing Caroline's tonight.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-10-100.  And, uh, Eric is doing a gig.  Uh, we talked about being 40.  It's called The Four Sides of 40, which is four comedians who are 40, I think, right?  Yeah, four sides.  We got a single, married, newlywed, and a divorcee.  Ooh.  Hey, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, Tarrytown Music Hall on, uh, Saturday night, up in, uh, by the Tappasee Bridge.  Ticketmaster? 
[02:51:00]  Tarrytownmusichall.org has everything, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh, Patty Rossborough is, uh,  like, the funniest female around.  She is really a fucking funny comic.  And, uh, Lenny Marcus and Al Ducharme's the, uh, foolishly got married at 40 years old.  Nope.  So, yeah, it's actually a good show, and, uh, Eric is a really good comic, and, um, so he's  there Saturday.  Wow, is it Caroline's tonight?  We're gonna come back.  And we're gonna continue, uh, celebrating three years at XM.  We gotta go hit the buffet now.  Look at that buffet.  It's just, it's just, uh, it's just there. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, from here, it would look like two shitty tables with not much food on it, but I'm sure  it's a lot more once we get out there.  I don't know what it is.  I wanna see how, I wanna see how the Hard Rock Cafe fucked up healthy food this time around.  Un-fucking-believin'.  Un-fucking-believable.  It's gonna be Captain Crunch grilled chicken fucking...  Yeah, it's like, great, it's, uh, grilled chicken.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, we put some Captain Crunch on it, and then we, it's like, can I just have grilled  chicken?  Right. 
[02:52:00]  What did they throw on the chicken that time?  It wasn't Captain Crunch, it was something else that was, potato chips or something.  Well, in Philly, when we asked them to find us some healthy food when we were kind of  promoting XM before we went back on the radio, they took us to, uh, uh, I forgot the name  of the joint, but we got chicken salads, and they threw, like, crab fries on them.  Yeah.  You couldn't even get to, like, the healthy stuff.  There were so many fucking fries in this healthy salad.  Yeah.  Uh, well, they're not really known for eating healthy with those cheese steaks. 
[02:52:30]  We doing Drill Dough into break?  Yeah.  So, Drill Dough was, uh, and still is, a classic bit from this program.  Still one of the top five bits we've done since, uh, coming to XM three years ago.  It's genius.  Yeah.  We love this bit.  But, uh, guys, uh, whip out your dicks, you're gonna enjoy this one.  Guy has a, uh, reciprocating, uh, saw, I think it was, or a drill.  No, it was the drill.  Obviously, Drill Dough.  Drill with a dildo on it.  And he starts working on this girl with this thing, and she, uh, hmm. 
[02:53:00]  Loves it.  And the sexiest thing is that, uh, pseudo Long Island Jersey accent that the girl has  when she wants more.  I want more.  More.  More.  Treat, treat me like a whore.  Treat me like a whore.  We eventually saw a picture of her, too, and we're not disappointed, because we like fat  pigs.  I wonder what the hell you were thinking. 
[02:53:30]  And, uh, that, that was, uh, gonna start something, but remember the guy that came  in with his own, uh, drill dough contraption?  And thank God we tried it out before we were gonna, uh, try it on a girl.  Oh, yeah.  It was a reciprocating saw, a sawzall.  And he had taken a blade and stuck it in the dildo and, like, uh, epoxied it in there.  And we, he shows up, we're like, all right.  And we were this close to trying it out on someone.  Like, maybe we should see if this works.  Like, give it a test run.  And we went, brrrr, you know, and, and got it moving. 
[02:54:00]  And before we knew it, the blade just popped through the side of the dildo.  We'd have just cut her womb out.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  So here's.  Hell of a scene.  Here's the, the famous, uh, the infamous, uh, dildo bit on, as Don King would say, the  Opie and Anthony rodeo show.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I want the drill.  You're going to have to pull it out.  Oh, please.  Should I turn it on?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, God.  I want the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Don't get me with me.  Oh, my God.  Don't get me with me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to feel the, I'm going to feel the head of the body. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, God.  Don't stop.  What's the matter?  Oh, my God.  What did I just do to you?  Treating me like a whore.  How did I do that?  By using the drill on me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck me with it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck me.

Only one orgasm?  Oh, yeah.  You promise?  Uh-huh.  I promise.  Oh, God.  Tell me when to turn it on.  Oh, God.  Turn it on, please.  Okay.  Full.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  You actually...  Oh, God.  You should stop.  Oh, my God.  Ah.  Ah.  Fuck you.  Oh, my God.  I'm so big.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Just stop.  Just stop.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.

[03:12:00]  horrified  and in hysterics  she was truly  sad  the video  is so funny  it's on  YouTube  it's not  the greatest  video  because we  learned to  make better  videos since  being here  but  because they  filmed right  into an open  window  so it's kind  of hard to  see  but what you  do see  is the camera  going around  the room  and no one  is willing  to look at  her  or talk  on the mic  because everyone  was just  couldn't breathe  that was one  of the longest  laughs ever  I had to  hide behind  the equipment  over here  I was horrified  to look at her 
[03:12:30]  it was such a  trinket like gift  she was just  trying to be nice  and she got  poker chips  thrown at her  but she was just  trying to bring  a gift that the  show would like  like oh hey  you know the show  you brought some  guy gifts  and was just  humiliated  like beat it  fatso  let's go back  to the phones  Mike in Queens  what's up Mike  the thing I  learned the most  important lesson  from your show  is never answer  the question  which way is  north  oh beautiful  that's a good  one  see that's old  let's say  hi to Matt  in New York  we don't have

[03:33:30]  what the fuck is that  Dr. Anthony Cumia  who said that  has found a way  to bring light  to the remaining days  on earth  your ass  talked to me  using a rare gift  he never knew he had  oh my god  what have I done  he'll learn to love  those he never knew existed  I think I know  what you're going for  you're going for sexy  you're coming off as whiny  ONA pictures  what a hot voice that is  and depends on their garments  I love it  present a true story  you're an ass

[03:34:30]  what  and someone said  and no one was like  festin' up  everybody was like  I didn't say anything  I go what was that  somebody talked  because I farted  just talking to your asshole  that's almost as bad  as the time I said  to my girlfriend  I love you  and she didn't hear me  and she goes  did you fart  I'm like no  you fucking castrating  awful human  I said I love you  and she wasn't being ironic  she really thought  I could have guessed her  fucking stab her  let's see  Mike learned that  the Greg and Tony show 
[03:35:00]  has Dr. Norton  with sex advice  very good  wow that goes back too  that's one of my favorite things  the jingle request 
[03:35:30]  suck my fucking cock  we should get that bit going again  that was great  we need brand new jingles  for the Opie and Anthony show  just like the two  you just heard  that Greg and Tony show  one fucking haunts me  yeah  the Tony show  the Tony show  it is creepy  that's great  let's uh  let's go to Josh in Philly  Josh  go Philly's baby  go Philly's  anniversary guys  first of all 
[03:36:00]  I learned Opie is a destroyer  alright  yes  Ed Asner  yeah  one of my worst moments  on the show  secondly  this city  with Opie and Mare  Spade  I mean street  was screwed  jeez  I missed the bell  Anthony's playing poker  why is this show  so painful for you  well Anthony's playing poker  we're all in California  at the poker tournament  and there's a lot of celebrities there  so we interviewed  Jennifer Tilly  we had a bunch of them  coming over  while Ant's in the poker tournament  me Opie and Joe Rogan  and Ed Asner was there 
[03:36:30]  from fucking  Mary Tyler Moore  and uh  well like  you know he's a legend  he's a legend  yeah  so we get him on the air  we're talking to him  and Opie's kind of  firing little snide remarks  at him  and I'm like  just trying to  I'm like the fucking  codependent wife  I'm like yeah  well you know  you know  just fucking covering up  and then Ben  our old producer  comes over  and he's like  yeah I don't know  and gesticulates somehow  and uh  and uh  and Asner goes  what did he say  and Opie goes  oh that's the signal  that he gives  when a guest has to go 
[03:37:00]  because they're boring  and my fucking  there was no covering it up  there was no amount  of laughing I could do  or go  yeah no  he just means  it was impossible  to misinterpret  and it was  and I think  Ed Asner said  he said goodbye  to me and Rogan  and he said  Opie you're a destroyer  he was fucking  not happy  you're a destroyer  of all good things  he was really miserable  he was a miserable man  a legend  did you want to hurt  his feelings  oh yeah yeah  how could you not  by saying  there's nothing  that could have been  except just hurt 
[03:37:30]  the old man  I was so fucking  mortified  because I get frustrated  like we're  in the middle of  like trying to do  a show for a lot  of people  and he's giving us  nothing  but he's Ed Asner  and then you're  getting all irritated  and like god damn it  say something  that people care about  and then I finally  couldn't help myself  anymore  it really was  even Rogan  was uncomfortable  yeah  let's go to  Keith  the trucker  Keith  yeah  hey guys  hey  I learned that  Edmund Fitzgerald  is a really long  fucking thought 
[03:38:00]  yeah we ripped  this one apart  for about  an hour and a half  one day  you know what's  interesting about  the radio show  that we were having  I remember that day  like it was yesterday  because we were having  an awful radio show  nothing was working  the chemistry sucked  people were tired  Colin Quinn came in  and he was having  an off day  and he usually  gives us good radio  and I remember going  holy shit  let's just get this show  over with  and start over tomorrow  and then the fucking  Edmund Fitzgerald 
[03:38:30]  bit happened  yeah  on a day that was  probably one of the  worst shows we've done  since coming back  wow  because I remember  it's very rare  I'll leave thinking  we had a really bad  show that day  I'm like fuck  we sucked so bad  today  but I don't remember  that anymore  for the most part  because of the  famous bit  yeah and now I  remember  because Colin  I remember he came  in and it was  real early  he decided to come  in and we were  all getting nothing  and he came back  the next day  and we all had  great shows 
[03:39:00]  yeah  because he goes  to me that night  he goes the show  has changed man  the vibe  I'm like no no  we were all tired  it was something  it was his first time  back since we had  been here  for AEW  yeah we were so off  except for that bit  that turned into gold  yeah  Jim from Philly  I learned that  bums who play guitar  will not stop  fiddling with their abs  twist turn  twist turn  make it all better  make it all better  I wanted to smack him  it was a nervous twist  every time we had  a homeless go play guitar  I missed a guy  what was his name again

[03:40:00]  already and he's like  okay okay  bling bling bling  and he'd start  playing a couple things  and then just start  fiddling with knobs  because his equipment  was fucked  we have any of that  nah that'll  that's a long one  that'll be tough  to get to right now  JP from work  I learned  E-Rock can win  $100,000  by stealing  the staff newspaper  but Opie will still  leave him behind  at the Rolling Stones  concert  oh wow  that's a good one  yeah E-Rock got ditched  somebody from New York City

[03:51:00]  I'm going  the only reason  why the surgery  got postponed  was because  my medical insurance  got all screwed up  so I had to go  see more doctors  so I go see  another doctor  tomorrow  and that should  clear everything up  for the surgeon  to schedule  the surgery  right  Jay Leno  yeah that's  a lot of you  people have said  yeah  so looking forward  to that  looking forward 
[03:51:30]  to this weekend  celebrating another  screwed up birthday  so  oh Jesus  how old are you  I'll be 33  33  isn't every birthday  at this point  a great birthday  every year  think about that  yeah you would think  that would be a good thing  oh it's always a good thing  I'm so excited  can't wait  I need to know  why the choice  of haircut  prison look  I'd go with  very long hair  I'd go with  an emo look 
[03:52:00]  yeah  I'd grow my hair long  and cover half  of my face with it  in the emo fashion  tried a long hair look  didn't like it  so just  cut everything off  everyone else did  didn't like it  yeah  that's like  there's no just  taking some  duct tape  and putting it  on your cheek  and pulling up  cause it's kinda  everything's falling  like your ear  is even lower now  than it was last time  yeah  you know  nothing I can really  do about it 
[03:52:30]  so I just  you know  bear with it  someday you're gonna  have to lift your arm  up to hear  cause the ear  will be in this  armpit  you know  I can barely hear  out of the right ear  now  so  what?  I can barely  hear out of the  right ear  now  what?  old peewee  hermit joke  awful  your calves  are looking good  though I gotta say  that  you're a fucking  walker  ah they're just  more tumors  no

I've had about  nine since I was  a kid  no no not  implants  and  any hope of  getting rid of  that?  no  no  why can't they  fix that?  realistically  no  they should be  able to  because  it will grow 
[03:53:30]  back  you know  I've seen  little kids  from other  countries  they drag  them over  here  and they  fix them  up  why can't  we fix  our own  people?  well  where the  tumor  started at  it's located  at the  back of  the head  near the  brain  and it's  basically  working its  way forward  and down  toward the  throat  so  from the  brain  to your  throat  well  back of  the head  right  why will  it grow  back?  that's one  of the things  about the  tumor  they don't  know why 
[03:54:00]  they grow  back  it's gonna  chew a tumor  it just  won't stop  stop watering  it  look at his  forehead sweating  as we interrogate  him under the  lightsaber  wait  so you  how long  did it take  to get to  this point?  last major  I had was  what 14  years ago?  see so you  should have it  removed and  then even if  it grows back  how old  you'll be  yeah just  marry a chick  and it'll be  14 years  before she  realizes the  horrible  errors she  made  holy shit  you'll have a  couple of  kids you'll  be on your  way  exactly  he always

This next bit we're hopefully going to play.  It might get cut off because of the old master computer.  It really captured the power of XM versus commercial radio.  It's a filthy, filthy voicemail left by one Pat O'Brien.  This is what the power of X is all about. 
[04:27:00]  Exactly.  Way to work the company slogan in there.  Why is this mic still on?  Oh.  My bad.  He hit it back on.  Yeah, we don't have much time, so we better just go right to the bit.
