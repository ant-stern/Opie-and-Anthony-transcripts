<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about Mondays and work, specifically an irritating wake-up call from Kenny.  They then launched into a discussion about a listener, Obi, suffering from a bizarre medical condition where his seminal fluid is vomited instead of ejaculated.  This transitioned into Anthony recounting a massive, unplanned poker game at his house resulting in a significant financial loss to an unknown woman and a brutal hangover.  The hosts reminisced about past interns, including "Pool Party Rob" (who lied extensively), Cream Pie Jones, and Pat Duffy.

A call from Carl revealed the financial downfall of Dominic Barbera, Anthony’s ex-wife’s lawyer during his divorce.  Audio clips played highlighted Barbera’s self-aggrandizing nature, and Anthony detailed Barbera’s arrogant and unprofessional conduct, including numerous anecdotes from court and Atlantic City, expressing a distinct lack of sympathy for him. The conversation returned to Anthony's costly divorce, focusing on the high legal fees and the relief he felt about not having children with his ex-wife, humorously comparing a potential life with children to that of the parents in *Natural Born Killers*.  The pre-commercial break discussion included their upcoming Halloween party, Anthony's musical tastes (and Joe Garofolo's commentary), and the difficulty of defining musical eras, particularly the 90s and 2000s.

The show continued with a deep dive into music, covering the evolution of rock, from nu-metal bands like Limp Bizkit (including a detailed account of a disastrous Limp Bizkit concert) and Linkin Park to indie rock.  They discussed various artists' careers and perceived declines, the impact of the internet on music consumption and memory, comedic timing, method acting, and their experiences working with Amy Schumer.  Music clips from Soundgarden, Collective Soul, Seven Mary Three, the Toadies ("Possum Kingdom"), the Offspring ("Smash"), Rancid, White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Kiss, and Alice in Chains were played, eliciting varied reactions and tangents. A personal anecdote about witnessing oral sex to White Zombie's music was shared, along with a comparison of Kiss and Alice in Chains' styles.  The segment concluded with a clip of Don Rickles on Letterman.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved a jingle contest, with Jim Norton and Joe DeRosa as guests.  Numerous listener submissions, many containing homophobic and derogatory lyrics targeting E-Rock and Sal, were played and critiqued.  "E-Rock Army Nigga" was a particularly popular submission.  The discussion meandered through topics such as Ed McMahon, Pablo Francisco's racial humor, the ethics of diamonds, and the hosts' preferences for older women.  Joe DeRosa promoted his web series, and the segment ended with a live, improvised recreation of Sal's "Don't get the panda angry!" production piece.

The final segment focused on the hosts' attraction to older women, sparked by browsing celebrity pictures. Graphic sexual language and descriptions were used while discussing the attractiveness of various actresses, including Goldie Hawn, Helen Mirren, Demi Moore, and many others.  The hosts debated the merits of aging women and their dating experiences with women of different ages.  The conversation included tangents on social media, Joe DeRosa’s web series, and an upcoming Peter Criss appearance.  The show concluded with plugs for the hosts’ projects and appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Woo-hoo!  Always reminds me of a little choo-choo train going down the track.  Hi, everyone! Hi!  Yes. It's the Opie and Anthony program.  And it is a wonderful, wonderful Monday-type morning. 
[00:00:30]  Which everyone just loves, don't they?  No.  Don't you love getting... What?  No.  You don't like getting out of the nice, warm bed?  Just hearing that alarm.  Meh!  And then you've got to get up right away because you already set the alarm pretty late.  Scramble and remember because it's Monday and the whole weekend you kind of got out of the whole gist of going to work.  So it takes longer to just find your shit.  I wander around in my room, in my closet and stuff.  I like... I'm a fucking retard. I don't know what I'm doing. 
[00:01:00]  Pants? Going to your head?  What is this? I don't know. It's Monday.  I forgot from Friday.  Ah, Saturday, Sunday. I didn't even wear clothes.  Great!  And then on Monday, you just all confoozid.  I was confoozid.  It's never my alarm. It's always... This is what I always hear.  Oh.  Good morning.  Kenny wakes me with a phone call.  Yeah, I have the alarm and Kenny.  And I'm still trying to figure out which one is more annoying when it goes off.  Meh!  Or hi. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  No, it's not.  I hear that phone ring and I just look at it and I know death is calling.  Do you have a picture on your phone that comes up with Kenny's face?  No, it's my home phone.  Oh, it... Oh!  You still have one of those?  Yeah, yeah.  My cell phone is off at night.  It never rings.  Yeah?  I have to... It will just light up a little bit.  Yeah.  But the cell phone, the text message would keep me up on that.  Oh, see, I turn on my phone.  I leave it on and then I got Kenny calls. 
[00:02:00]  So when I pick the phone up, the first face I see every morning is that of Kenny.  That delightful face.  And of course, I wouldn't have just picked any picture.  It's kind of a funny, you know, goofy Kenny picture.  So I look at that and then I hear,  Hi! Everything okay? You up?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Then I proceed to fall right back to sleep.  It's awful.  It's so terrible.  I hate it.  Why couldn't they just shift this whole work thing to like 1, 2 a.m. or something like that? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it really blows.  Yeah.  I'd never get used to it.  Never.  In seven years, I haven't gotten used to it.  No.  Once you get here, it's, you know, pretty cake.  But that waking up thing, I don't care where you're going.  You know?  I guess it doesn't really matter what your job is.  You can have a job fucking just, you know, looking at beautiful vaginas all day.  And it was still like, oh, gotta get up early.  Look at those vaginas.  Yeah.  You just find something to complain about?  Yes, always.  They're not going to be shaved. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, boy.  I hate the sounds of those jeans getting pulled off.  Yuck.  Something would bother you.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So it's Monday.  Hi.  Obi, I guess.  What?  Another procedure?  Yes.  I forgot.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Poor guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  You know what it is?  I have no clue this time around.  It's a really weird, it's an intestinal tract thing.  Oh.  Where you just, you're vomiting cum. 
[00:03:30]  What?  And it's a weird, it's a weird seminal fluid thing.  Like your semen doesn't go to your testicles.  Oh, it's his own.  His own, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  But it's a, yeah, no, he's not, he's not doing anything.  All right.  But what happens is the wiring gets mixed up.  Yeah.  And it goes into the abdomen and the body vomits it up instead of ejaculating.  Wow.  Yes.  That sounds terrible.  And I've never heard of that before.  Yeah, it's a really weird one.  He's been talking about it off the air.  He's been very depressed.  Oh.  Whenever he masturbates, his dick burps.  So they have to fix the wiring. 
[00:04:00]  So the cum comes out that way.  Oh, okay.  Well, I hope they fix that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Figure that whole thing out.  I think it comes from nodding your stomach up.  The wiring gets all mixed up.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  We'll have to get a little status report on how he's doing there.  Godspeed.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a poker game over my house on Friday.  I'm Mr. Yeah, sure, sure, yeah, sure.  Because my brother was like, hey, how about we get a poker game together at your house? 
[00:04:30]  And I'll call up some of the guys that have been over your house before for poker games.  I'm like, okay.  That's not a problem.  Well, Joe called them, and I guess they called people too.  And I had a house full of people on Friday.  I was expecting a few people for a poker game.  It was packed.  Packed house.  Any girls?  Like girlfriends and wives with small players.  Boo!  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  But it was just a mob. 
[00:05:00]  And people, I just had no clue who they were.  In your house?  Yeah.  Oh, I can not.  Oh, it's scary.  But you have like an open, that's your open invite thing.  Well, yeah, maybe the open invite.  Well, I say open invite to the people I know.  Oh.  But then they plus one the shit out of me.  Oh, I see.  You know?  And then the plus ones now the next time.  They're like, why was there last time?  I was there.  I'm good.  Now I'm the guest.  Now I'm in.  I'm in.  So what?  No, nothing missing.  It was actually good.  They were all pretty good.  But that's also why, you know, especially for the beginning of it, you just got to, that's 
[00:05:30]  why you walk around with the gun on your hip.  That way, the second they come in, it's like, hey, nice to meet you.  And they're in your house.  It's like, all right, now maybe they won't case the joint because they know this might  be a problem if they come in and try to do any shenanigans.  You know, it's just my way of telling them, hi, you're welcome, but touch anything and  I'll shoot you.  Yeah.  The American way.  And yeah, so it was a fucking mob scene and I lost. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't win.  You did?  Some girl took me out of the game.  Did you know who she was?  I don't think so.  So she came into your house and did take all your money.  Yeah, well.  But she just had permission.  She had permission.  Yeah.  She's playing the game.  But I got so fucking snotted.  I was drinking a lot of vodka and I wound up waking up.  First of all, I didn't even go to bed until the next morning. 
[00:06:30]  Last thing I really have a fond memory of is sitting on the couch with like-minded drunks  laughing our asses up at the honeymooners.  I saw your tweet about to watch the greatest show ever.  Yeah.  And I knew what it would be, but it was a picture of the honeymooners.  Yeah, that was it.  I had a feeling you weren't just waking up.  I don't think, Anna, this is not before the jog show.  No.  No, it wasn't.  And then, um, yeah, also that night was like a jacuzzi. 
[00:07:00]  The jacuzzi got fired up for the first time in a while because it's been kind of cold.  It was kind of cold.  Well, not cold enough, my friend.  The latter half of October.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Jacuzzi got fired up.  All in the jacuzzi.  Why not?  And then, uh, and then I woke up the next, uh, day.  I woke up, but I stayed in bed and I just kind of on and off slept through.  See, that's something, Jimmy, you can't even appreciate.  I feel sorry for you in a way.  You don't know what it's like to wake up with a throbbing headache. 
[00:07:30]  Uh, the feeling that you're going to vomit, uh, not being able to eat and just praying for more sleep.  I knew that feeling.  And then I moved my mirror away from the bed and I now feel it in the way I'm brushing my teeth.  It was, uh, it was, uh, it was, uh, it was bad.  It was, uh, very bad hangover.  And, uh, I wound up getting out of bed at about 9 p.m.  Wow.  9 p.m.  I decided it's time to get out of bed.  Did you puke?  No, no, it was pretty good. 
[00:08:00]  Because, uh, I stayed in bed.  And then it was that on again, off again, just losing time through sleep like a fucking UFO took me away.  And I'm just looking, it's like, okay, it's, it's like, uh, 11 a.m.  And then all of a sudden, hey, it's, it's 2 p.m.  Now, like, 3.30.  You're just kind of up and asleep, writhing around in your own sweat and your booze sweat.  And, uh, yeah, yeah, then 9 o'clock I was like, all right, I think I'm ready to face the day.  What do you do when you get up and you feel like that?  Like, what's the first, what, will you eat crackers or something or have some ginger ale? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, no, I was, uh, I was, uh, nice cold water, a little soup.  Yeah, that's good.  Something like that.  And, uh, and then, like, grapes.  Something wet and cold.  Like my fucking forehead.  Do you ever think to yourself, I just wasted my, I lost my Saturday.  Like, don't you ever miss, you know what, though?  Having twice as much fun Friday, half as much fun Saturday.  I understand.  It evens out.  It balances out.  It totally balances itself out.  So if you have a wonderful Friday night, you're okay losing Saturday. 
[00:09:00]  I didn't mind at all.  It was a fun Friday night.  Yeah.  Drinking shenanigans, poker, big party, fucking jacuzzi, shit like that.  And then, uh, Saturday, eh, from 9 p.m. till about, I guess, 5 a.m. I stayed awake.  Watched some movies and stuff.  Oh, okay.  It was cool.  Chill.  Yeah, it was totally chill.  I liked it.  I threw one party when I was in college.  Woo!  That's it.  And I locked, uh, all, we locked all our extra toilet paper and food into our bedroom so nobody 
[00:09:30]  took it.  Is that what you were worried about?  And then nobody showed up anyway.  Oh.  Oh, no.  What are you, an intern?  We were playing video games, waiting for people to come, and then we realized there's  like 1 o'clock in the morning.  We're like, I don't think anybody can come to this.  Oh, no one showed up.  Yeah, but we didn't do a very good job of inviting people either.  We were very lazy.  What, did you just think it?  I don't know.  No one showed up?  Wait, what happened to that intern?  Remember the guy?  Yeah, what?  He threw his party.  Oh, pool party Rob? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Pool party Rob.  He's a good dude.  You don't know what I mean?  His internship ended.  I didn't know that.  And then, but his last week he had invited Opie to do that golfing thing.  Right.  Opie told me this weekend he never invited Opie golfing.  No, he never called him.  He blew him off.  I remember that.  Yeah, that was a while ago and he never called him.  Never just disappeared.  I guess he hasn't been in touch with anybody, huh?  No.  He left this internship running.  Right.  Tail between legs.  Why?  That was funny, but he was memorable.  I mean, I haven't thought of him since then, but I mean, he was, uh, it was 
[00:10:30]  an event.  It was something.  Yeah.  I guess.  But he's probably not used to, cause we, he was a liar and we totally, we were obviously  the only people that have ever kind of questioned him.  Exposed him.  Especially to that level.  Cause we talked to him for like two hours straight until, cause that's when it started  getting weird.  Yeah.  And I don't think he's ever been questioned on that level with, with the things that  he provides as facts.  He wasn't questioned.  That was an interrogation.  Yeah.  That is, uh, second to only a professional, uh, police officers. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Uh, this guy was exposed and I don't think he liked that at all.  That's why I think he went running because he's probably got a lot of lies.  He didn't want to be exposed.  That he's built over the years.  Knew the longer he spent here, the more we were going to just fucking, I was going to  say it, but chisel away at it.  Let's say.  That's exactly right.  Chisel away at his lies.  Yes, that's exactly right, but he's just not used to being so exposed. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long ago did he leave?  I forgot.  He was a summer guy.  He was probably gone end of August.  He went back to school in Pennsylvania, unless he was lying about that.  I'll meet guys sometimes.  I met someone recently who's driving and I used a car service somewhere.  He goes, oh yeah, I interned for you, but I didn't remember him.  Oh, that's every intern.  Was it Joe?  I don't remember.  I know he drives.  I don't remember this.  He's a nice dude.  Yes, he was very good.  Don't remember their names.  That's who I'm thinking of. 
[00:12:00]  Don't remember their faces.  Don't remember what they did or didn't do.  No.  I don't care.  Even we don't.  And we spend, you know.  And you have to deal with them.  Yeah.  Every day.  Like, we'll go back sometimes.  Hey, you remember this guy?  And I'll be like, I have no idea who you're talking about.  But that's, yeah, because there's a handful that we remember.  But even like Rob, who had that two hour bid or whatever on the air, like, I never  think, I never remember him.  Yeah.  Like, aside from, you know, David and Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie.  You know, I don't really remember him.  Cream Pie was great.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy, of course. 
[00:12:30]  Paul, I remember for some reason.  I don't know why I always remember him, but I just do.  He worked for us for a little while.  Well, he was here for a while.  That's why.  Okay.  Him I think of.  Yeah.  But yeah, Pat Duffy, Cream Pie, and fucking David.  David.  Those are the top three that, I mean, unbeatable.  Unbeatable.  Exactly.  Because you don't remember any of the normal ones.  I'm still friendly with Rachel.  You remember her?  Our one female intern ever.  Renee?  Renee, I'm sorry.  Renee. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, she was here.  Oh, was she?  Not too long ago.  Yeah.  I think she's trying to get a job still.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She'll always update me like once every few months I'll hear from her.  Yeah.  I was up here looking for work.  I'm like, okay.  I'm like, okay.  Still won't sleep with me?  No.  Oh.  Zero vibes.  This is nice.  Next party is Saturday.  This coming Saturday, I've invited all of you people.  I can't come.  I'll be in Philly.  Oh, man.  It's a big Halloween bash. 
[00:13:30]  What?  Oh, is that Saturday?  The big Halloween bash is Saturday.  When is Halloween?  Eastside Dave will be attending.  Uh-oh.  So I think, yeah, that should be a show in itself.  Yeah.  He said he texted me a thousand times over the weekend telling me he's laying off drinking  until the party.  Just, he's going to save himself so that when the party is going on, he can just get completely  trapped.  I'm bummed.  I'm missing your Halloween.  I was just thinking, I can't wait to go to Ann's Halloween party. 
[00:14:00]  It's going to be a biggie, too.  Of course it will.  A lot of people.  A lot of people showing up for this one.  God damn it.  Oh, damn.  Jimmy.  I like when Jimmy shows up.  He showed up as Uncle Paul once.  That's who I was going to be this year.  Great.  I was going to be Uncle Paul.  Oh, shave the top of your head.  Yeah.  Jimmy gets the horseshoe bald head thing going, and Uncle Paul, and he just harasses the girls.  It's wonderful.  I love doing that.  Fuck.  I can't cancel Philly.  Oh, man.  Are you going to do a costume?  I don't know what I'm going to be.  I don't have anything figured out yet. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  You going?  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't know about it until just now, though.  Oh, I've told everybody.  Where have you been?  I guess I wasn't in the room.  I should have drawn up some invitations.  Yeah.  Your mom could help you?  Yes.  Terrible.  Yuck.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Actually, Carl, on line one, I wanted to talk about this.  I got wind of this over the weekend.  What's going on?  Hi, Carl.  What's up? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, I'm a fat, bloated attorney, but now I'm nothing more than a shriveled-up, penniless,  skinny piece of shit.  Wow.  All right.  Right on the money.  An invitation.  I read the article.  The first thing I thought about was Anthony.  I said, oh, good.  This fat fuck, now he's got no money.  I'm addicted to Vicodin.  So I thought you'd get a little out of that.  Yeah, he's trying to get sympathy, I think.  Good luck.  I'm going to guess it's Dominic Barber.  Dominic Barber.  Good.  The attorney who represented my wife. 
[00:15:30]  He apparently is broke, lost his houses, and is now staying with friends, and occasionally  he was, I guess, in the Garden City Hotel for a little while through friends and former  clients that gave him a little bit of money to stay there, but now he's staying with a  friend.  By people living, yeah, former clients that are probably living off other people's fucking  earnings.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, yeah, you want to take some.  I didn't earn this either.  Yep.  He's been suspended as far as his law practice goes. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  And they're looking into even more charges against him for misappropriation of funds, and  I guess he's got a contempt charge against him also.  He didn't pay attention to a restraining order against one of his wives.  He contacted her, so they're looking into that.  He had this big house out on Eastern Long Island, right by the water, and it's in foreclosure,  and they have pictures of it.  It's just a mess. 
[00:16:30]  All of his shit's everywhere.  There's like a coffee cup on the table with a B on it, Barbara, and like all this shit  there.  There's this big.  B is for bum.  For bum.  You are a bum.  Oh, you got.  You want to hear him talking about himself in the third person?  Please.  Before you play it, let me say, from what I've gotten from the article, this guy wants it  to sound like, you know, he found himself.  He's apparently born again.  And he realizes how stupid he was. 
[00:17:00]  But in the same article, the guy talks about how he popped in a video of when he was on  TV and looked at it like longingly.  And he's still a self-centered schmuck.  I mean, he wants to be famous.  I barely played this.  I just previewed it just to make sure it was the right clip, you know?  Yeah.  And he spoke for, I don't know, four seconds, and I was already like, this guy's a fucking  asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  It says, Dominic Barbera, from brash to broke, sees comeback.  I'm really looking just to be happy, to be able to enjoy. 
[00:17:30]  You know, Dominic never really was happy.  He had five homes.  But if you ever sat down to him and said, are you happy?  He'd say, no.  I was obese.  I was so fat that I wore 62 size pants.  You rocked, turn your mic off.  I wore 37, and I'm having a baby soon.  I would have lost.  I just laughed over it.  By the way, folks, that's not your rock.  That's Dominic.  Dominic, still chatting. 
[00:18:00]  It's hilarious.  So I would have lost a total of 160 pounds.  I invented something with a doctor, which is a supplement called Fat No More.  I'm doing this to help people, because I know how miserable I was at 135 pounds.  He's so full of shit.  From the addiction to food, spending, from wanting to kill myself, I want to have a new  life.  I know how good I feel when I walk and how I feel about myself. 
[00:18:30]  I want to give this to people.  I want to give it to them.  Unfortunately, it's not AIDS.  Yeah, it's hard not to hate him, because he's a divorce lawyer, and those guys just are typically  scummy.  This guy got what is called a comeuppance.  Yeah.  He was what a prick this guy was.  He was so condescending to everybody, in love with himself, with fame, and just would do 
[00:19:00]  anything to hold on to it.  And not an honorable man.  Do you give yourself a quick yes, like every time there's something in the paper?  Oh, yes.  I was just watching that video.  There's something that just snaps in the back of your head.  Yes.  Yeah.  I saw the pictures of his house, and I was like, I just want to buy it.  I just want to buy it from the bank, and just fucking burn it down.  I don't even know. 
[00:19:30]  It's in foreclosure.  You want to buy it, and then just use every room as an open-air toilet.  He spent $4 million on a house, and he's just been, for the last, spent three years piling  up duty on the floor in every room.  He's like an east side of Detroit house, where they just ditch bodies there.  Yeah, you just have a big sign in this expressway bathroom, and let everybody take dumps on  the floor and tinkle.  Fucking terrible.  Yeah.  It's Shelter Island, is it?  Yeah.  Can you, like, somebody who makes their living busting people's balls, and making sure that 
[00:20:00]  everything is in order, and if it's not, they try to take everything, to not be double-checking  yourself.  Did he lose any divorce?  What happened to him?  Well, a lot of his money went into his own divorces.  How many marriages?  I think four.  What an idiot.  Something like four fucking marriages?  But also, he, I guess he just blew through a lot of fucking money.  He said he was driving Bentleys, and parking him illegally, because I just thought I could. 
[00:20:30]  I was that kind of guy.  He's a real fool.  He makes a living making sure that people kind of live up to the consequences of their  actions or whatever, and, like, every single consequence you could possibly imagine.  And he's, like, he is unaware that he's a person, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  You know what?  But he was on Stern's show for forever.  Is he still going on or no?  I get it.  He actually said he's going to try selling this fat no more, which, by the way, I thought 
[00:21:00]  he had a fucking lap band put in and didn't lose the weight with fucking drugs.  Did he?  Wow, that's what I heard.  Oh.  And then he's talking about how he's going to sell this fucking amphetamine, and that  his friend Howard's going to let him promote it on his show.  Really?  Didn't we have a problem when comedians wanted to talk about their gigs on the show at one  point without them, you know, getting paid for it? 
[00:21:30]  Dominic's just going to come in and start doing commercials for his fat no more product?  That's a different universe.  It certainly is.  He still thinks he's not on the same level as people.  Yes.  He's full of shit when he says, you know, oh, I hit bottom, and I realize now what an  ass I was.  You know, like when he said Dominic was never happy?  Anybody that talks about themselves.  Jim hates that.  Jimmy really likes you.  Yeah.  Yeah, but see, when Jim does it, it's actually one of his other personalities talking, so 
[00:22:00]  it's valid.  Chipper.  Jerry doesn't like that.  Jerry who?  I don't want to say it.  Right.  So, yeah, he really is a tool, this guy.  Yeah, and it's so hard not to revel in someone's misfortune when they've been such an insufferable  prick.  But do you try?  Do you actually try not to revel in it?  You know what the answer would be?  No, I don't even try. 
[00:22:30]  That's why it's difficult, because you enjoy it.  But, dude, I'm reveling in it, and it's just for you.  Like, he didn't do anything to me, and I'm happy to see him suffer because he was fucking  shitty to you.  So, as person A looking at person B going through shit, there's a part of you that doesn't want  to revel in it because there but for the grace of God go I, as they say.  Sure.  But, as Anthony Cumia looking at Dominic Barbara, I can't help but just hope it gets, oh, so 
[00:23:00]  much worse for him because he's fucking...  It's like, I like to see him, you know, in his little failures like this because of what  happened with you guys.  But, at the same time, it's more so, like, not the divorce, but the fact that he came  up to you afterwards and tried to be nice.  Oh, yeah.  Like, that was the part that bugged me more so than, like, you know, if he's representing  your ex-wife or whatever, that's just...  He's doing his job or whatever.  But to come up after the fact, like, eh, Anthony, that was like, holy fuck, what an asshole.  To me, it transcended just strictly business. 
[00:23:30]  The guy took pleasure in taunting the people that he was up against.  And with me, it was every time I was in the court building, he would show up and just  be like, Anthony, hey, how are you?  Hey, like, it was...  And he knew what he was doing.  Yeah, I remember there was some...  This isn't fucking...  There was some running in Atlantic City.  Atlantic City, too.  I was eating at one of the restaurants there or some shit, and he was walking by and he  goes, hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  I was just like, Dominic, I'm eating. 
[00:24:00]  Could you fucking just leave?  I just don't understand how he expects your response to be pleasant.  He's like, oh, what's the matter?  What's the matter?  Lots of money.  Is he such a...  Or are divorce attorneys just such vultures that to them it's nothing personal?  Like, to them, is it like almost like the way radio guys look at a market?  Like, hey, you were on in the afternoons in Philly, now we're in the afternoon and you're  in the morning.  Like, it's not personal.  So, that's how I think lawyers can be such fucking vultures because they can look at 
[00:24:30]  it like that.  Psychotic.  For them to not know that the layman cannot stand you is a little, you know, a little out  there.  But it was a tactic of his.  Oh, it was.  Yeah.  He knew it was just an awful fucking, like, fuck you thing to do.  In the court, he'd always be like, yeah, do an impression of me.  Go ahead.  And then he'd turn to other people, listen to this, let...  Would you do it?  No!  I'd be like, I'm not a performing seal here for you, Dominic.  Yeah.  Get to the fucking point. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, he's sociopathic.  Any lawyer, if you're a lawyer, and a lot of lawyers are like that, but any lawyer who  doesn't think that their actions have consequences...  Yeah.  ...is that you're a lawyer.  Yeah.  You know consequences of actions.  Exactly.  I mean, he knew the case as good as anyone, as far as my wife, what she did or didn't  have to do with my career, and instead of, you know, and I know it's his job to do that. 
[00:25:30]  I'm not that stupid.  I know it's his job.  But then don't turn around like you're just doing your job to me.  Yeah.  I know you knew that she didn't have anything to do with where I ended up in radio, yet  you preached the fact that she should be a partner in this, and, you know, and I was  just like, you're a fucking prick.  You're lying about the impact she had on my career, and it's costing me a lot of fucking  money, and he made a lot of money from it.  They have the ability, and they are just doing their jobs, but this is why they're hateable 
[00:26:00]  lawyers, because they have the ability to turn off or to ignore that part of them where  they know something is garbage or dishonest.  And it's like, you know, much more serious case.  You look at prosecutors and how when a case, when they deep down know in their guts, wow,  this was a bad conviction, they still fight it because they don't want to lose their conviction.  When they want to block evidence that's obvious and will exonerate somebody, and they don't, 
[00:26:30]  and they try their best to keep it out.  Why would you do that?  Isn't the job supposed to be to find the truth?  I know that's kind of silly, but yeah, to then fight to keep that out, it's a scumbaggy  thing to do.  There was a guy who was, this is off the subject, but it's kind of about being going to jail.  Did you read the one, this guy turned himself in for, he licked the vagina of a four-month-old  baby, like he was watching porn? 
[00:27:00]  Jesus.  I got Twittered this.  He was like 25, this guy, and he turned himself in in like Kansas City, I think it was.  And he got life in prison.  Wow.  Which I was, I thought that was kind of harsh because he turned himself in.  Why did he turn himself in?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because he's dumb.  But no, that's not to do with lawyers really, but this guy turned himself in and he just,  it's not like he fucked the kid, which I don't mean to differentiate between, but I mean, 
[00:27:30]  you know.  He was watching porno and what motivation to do that?  I don't know.  There's something deep and psychological, but doesn't that kind of, isn't that kind of a  deterrent from other people?  Maybe not.  Because if you confess murder, you go to jail for murder.  You know what?  If you confess rape, you go to jail for rape.  Yeah.  That's true.  What a dunce.  What a ghoul.  Wow.  That is bad.  Yeah.  It's just lawyers and people, especially like Dominic, I had firsthand contact with like 
[00:28:00]  that.  Yeah.  And he was always more interested in what he was doing outside of the law firm.  He'd be talking to the judge and other attorneys about his TV show that he had going on and  his appearances on radio and all that shit.  And meanwhile, you know, my fucking life is hanging in the balance as far as, you know,  finance is going.  He's sitting in a courtroom with zero empathy for you to the point where he's taking your  money and then asking you to do impressions. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  And then now he's putting out videos where it's like, don't you people care whether or  not I'm happy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you're going to like, you're going to sit there and be like, oh, I hope Dominic is  feeling happy.  How insane is that?  Just a narcissist.  That's all.  Yeah.  He's a typical fucking narcissist.  He honestly thinks people will watch that and go like, oh, he wasn't happy.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Oh, man.  He really needs to be happy.  He's done so much for people.  Yeah.  Fuck off.  Well, he's suffering. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  And you think you think he'd have ironclad fucking prenups?  Oh, no.  Of course.  He's constantly.  And he's about to get married again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's got another fiancee.  What a dummy.  Who, um, talk about somebody who doesn't understand consequences, right?  You're going to get married for the fourth time.  What's wrong with you?  Keeps repeating the same mistake over and over again.  I remember his last, I'm pretty sure it was his last wife, if it wasn't the one before  that, but his last wife was his law firm, like worked at his law firm, whether she was  a partner or not.  But I remember when she used to come wheeling in with the little fucking hand truck full of 
[00:29:30]  those lawyer cardboard file boxes stacked up, and it was my fucking case.  And they'd come wheeling in, and every box I'm looking at, I'm thinking, how much fucking  money that shit cost me?  Yeah.  Because, like, that, I was paying for all that shit.  All that shit.  Here, could you fuck me, and I'll buy the dildo.  That's pretty much what the fuck it was.  How do you justify that?  And I'll pay for a fresh one each time. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  I'll bet you half of those boxes have nonsense in them.  And I'll bet you it's an intimidation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, sometimes when profilers want to catch a serial killer, they line up evidence in  the room when they sit them down.  They have such a mountain of images and stuff that it just overwhelms them, and I bet you  that that's what that is.  My sister used to have to do some shit at work.  She was in retail and stuff, and she would bust the people for stealing on the job and  have to confront them, and she would have a folder with papers in it, and she'd sit them 
[00:30:30]  down and talk and put the folder on the table.  And when she talked about what they did and how they got caught, she would tap on the  folder, like, the info's right here, without saying the info's right here, but the people  would look at the folder and think, God, there's a mountain of evidence against me that must have  been on this book.  What evidence could there be that just happened?  No, it was the cases that would build up.  Not just like I caught you shoplifting.  It was like loss prevention, where they'd have cameras, and they'd have, like, receipts 
[00:31:00]  and evidence, and then finally confront the person after they put a little case together.  But they would actually have a case together, wouldn't they?  Yeah, but sometimes they wouldn't have that evidence they would need, or that much evidence.  They knew something was amiss.  But then Donna would just go in there with the dumb folder, her empty folder, and of  course they would goof on her about the empty folder.  Call it stupid, but I guess she caught people with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, those boxes probably were fucking empty. 
[00:31:30]  Half of them.  Intimidated.  And then my lawyer, what a prize he was.  He'd come in with, like, I used to come into fucking history class.  You got a pencil and paper?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  Oh, my discount lawyer.  Oh, God.  You have to rip him out of page.  The spiral notebook things are still on the side of it, because you ripped him out of  page from your notebook.  What is this?  Oh, sorry.  This was Dominic and Our.  Back in 2000 or whatever it was.  It was him, his fucking paralegals would make a certain amount, his assistants would make 
[00:32:00]  a certain amount.  It was terrible.  Did you pay more than $40,000 for her lawyer?  Do you think total?  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  More importantly, who was more expensive?  Her lawyer that you paid for or your personal attorney?  I paid so much more to have her lawyer fuck me than I paid to stop being fucked.  Oh.  Yes.  That was a terrible investment. 
[00:32:30]  It was.  That was the wrong way to use money.  Why'd you get her a good lawyer, Ant?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  There should...  I don't understand how that works.  You definitely should have traded lawyers at some point, if you're paying for both  of them.  I immediately...  The second this thing was even conceived of, the first thing they did in court was decide  how much I had to give her every month.  How much I just had to give her.  And that was a figure.  A dollar amount, which was a lot.  And above and beyond that, I still had to pay for her lawyer? 
[00:33:00]  Like, shouldn't it come out...  Now she's making...  That's her income.  She should have to spend that on her lawyer.  But now I got to pay also the lawyer.  It doesn't make sense at all.  Could you have fought that?  I mean, it would have cost you more to fight it, though.  Of course I could have fought it until it went to trial and everything.  It went so long.  And it was taking up so much of my time, energy, sanity, health, and money that I just decided  I have to stop this and settle out.  How happy were you that you had faked orgasms and not had any kids? 
[00:33:30]  Genius.  I loved it that I never had that child she wanted oh so badly.  You would have owed a lot more money in everything the kid needed.  I'd still be, like, with her at some point.  When did she want the kid?  Like, what year?  Early 90s.  So that kid would be...  20?  Oh, shit.  You'd see her at all the events, though.  Like, everything that was...  The graduations.  The fucking wedding someday.  Oh, I would have to fucking actually have an interaction. 
[00:34:00]  You'd be talking to your kid and he'd be like, oh, mom was saying that...  Could you help mom out?  Oh, no!  Would you have it, like, every other weekend?  Like, that's going to affect compound parties and stuff.  I would have to do that.  You'd be like, how come mom is so mad at you for blah, blah, blah, and you'd be still...  Still dealing with it.  Yeah, say, look, I said...  Yeah, Fishman's right.  The kid would be at my fucking house all the time.  Yeah.  I want to go to this Donnie Darko universe and check this out. 
[00:34:30]  It would be pretty fun.  That would have been like...  Oh, that would stink.  Yeah, hey, dad.  Hey, mom, how come dad always refers to you as the cunt when he was age?  Mama, what's a cunt?  Oh, yeah.  I could hear the stories like, oh, yeah, dad.  I'd be like, oh, so how's your mother doing?  She came in last night.  It was pretty loud.  Kind of bumping into things.  Did you ever think that if you didn't get divorced and this radio thing didn't happen, you would  just be the parents from Natural Born Killers? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to come up there later to see how clean you are.  Oh, Rodney.  That was a great Rodney role.  That was amazing.  Go upstairs and get clean for daddy.  It was so creepy.  Oh, that was really bad.  I don't know what I'd be doing.  It would suck, though.  It would have sucked to have to still have been, have any contact with that woman whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  I've just heard little inklings in the past fucking forever that let me know, like, 
[00:35:30]  kind of what she's doing at a moment's notice.  Last thing I heard was someone said, yeah, I saw her coming out of a bar and hopping on  the back of some biker's bike and speeding off.  I'm like, great.  That's all right.  Did you immediately put your fingers in your ears and start going, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la?  Were you jealous?  Yeah.  That's my girl.  Yeah.  What are you doing, huh?  My aunt went home and beat off to it like a couple of times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I beat off to the idea of the bike getting hit by a tractor trailer. 
[00:36:00]  Just, ugh, just awfulness.  I can't believe, though, that you had that, you had to pay that much money and there weren't  even any kids.  No kids, no house, there was no, there was no property, there was nothing but Dominic  Barbara saying that I had future potential earnings of millions upon millions of dollars.  It's a terrible scenario to receive a nice compliment.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It, it was so bad sitting there and hearing him just going off about what she did and 
[00:36:30]  how she nurtured my career.  Just how they did, but she could take that money and not have to pay you back that 40  grand or whatever it was.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How do people get away with that?  You're right.  It's all a fucking, it's a system.  It's A and B and C and there's no, you thought it was going to be all like arguing real points,  right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I know.  May the best man win.  The delusions you have because of television of what it's supposed to be, like, oh, they 
[00:37:00]  argue about it and I'm like, I know this, it's great.  The divorce proceedings started before I signed a big contract.  I was making okay money at WNEW, but nowhere near with the next contract I had signed.  So she wasn't even with me during the time I signed that contract, but they pushed this  future potential earning shit at me and how that's an, that is an equity just as property 
[00:37:30]  is and everything else.  That's a thing.  That's a marital asset that they can split up.  The idea that perhaps it's like, and in radio, stop it.  It could be over in a second by saying fucking, you know, the, the, the, go have sex in the  church.  But why do they say that potential earnings is guaranteed earnings?  Exactly.  That was, that was my lawyer's argument.  Maybe he brought the paper with him that set it on it.  You should have sabotaged your career just to spite her. 
[00:38:00]  It, well, and you did get called out on cheating and went to a private room to settle.  Well, that did kind of happen.  My first fucking five minutes on the stand during the beginning of the whole thing, I  was just like, all right, this is it.  I've had it.  Settle, settle.  Let's talk.  Like, like, even though, like, in that situation, the fact that she was involved with it for  a while.  I know.  I think, I think that would bode well for you.  The worst part, though, was the fact that the postponements and Dominic, what he would 
[00:38:30]  do is we'd set a court date, I'd have to, like, whatever, drop everything to be there, and  I'd go there, and then he'd walk up and postpone it for another three months.  And then I'd be like, I thought today was going to be like, we're going to start, and things  are going to get going, and just wore me down.  They do, that's why they do it.  It went years.  And then my dumb lawyer trying to go to the judge and just say, look, what the fuck are 
[00:39:00]  you doing?  Let's get this shit moving.  Oh, well, well, thanks.  And they just, most of it wasn't even arguing the case or the marriage or anything.  It was just arguing, like, when we would come back, under what circumstances, who had  to be, it was, it had nothing to do with the actual meat of the whole thing.  And years were going by, and I was just spending so much money for her lawyer, my lawyer, all  this bullshit that I, finally, when I hit the stand and he was like, what's the date of 
[00:39:30]  your anniversary?  And I was like, ah, well, I don't know.  It was March 19th?  And it was like, oh, it was May 19th.  It's like, oh, March was Swallow's Day in Capistrano.  Of course.  That was a much more important day than my fucking marriage.  So, and then he started bringing up other things, and I see the New York Post and Daily  News are in the little gallery, and they're jotting stuff down.  I'm just like, I've had it.  So I took her into one of the fucking chat rooms there and told her, you know, I want to 
[00:40:00]  settle this.  Be realistic.  But then you had a terrible lawyer, so it's like...  Exactly.  So the settlement was even a fucking disaster.  Whatever they wanted.  How long after that did you settle?  When you brought her into that room, how long did it take?  Another fucking couple of months.  Oh, really?  To settle it?  Terrible, yes.  Because they just kept trying to get more.  Do you know what my lawyer's big win was for me?  What?  That if I died, I still didn't have to pay her. 
[00:40:30]  They wanted that.  They wanted it in a settlement that said, if I died, my estate would still have to pay  her out.  So your lawyer goes to you, don't worry, though.  If you die...  I'm on this.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  You're good.  You're good.  You're right, though, about the movies and everything, because I assume that literally  you leave the courtroom and you go into the room to settle, and then that's the last day.  You're done.  That day, you settle.  Nope.  They go, oh, we're going to settle, and then there's some kind of agreement to settle, 
[00:41:00]  settle, and then you go through all the shit that, what do you want as far as the settlement  goes?  Because it's not just money.  There's other shit as far as...  And then there was like, what you can talk about, what you can't talk about, what this  disparaging remarks, this, that, all kinds of horse shit.  Oh, wow.  Yep.  Oh, you're done with it.  Oh, am I done with it?  You're done with it, and they're both broke.  That's why...  How great is that, though?  All you're doing is fucking living in a great house in a jacuzzi, there's always fucking 
[00:41:30]  broads in it.  I revel.  Fast forward.  It's the end of October, and you're in a jacuzzi with chicks, and Dominic Barbera is  on Newsday.  Is at the Garden City Hotel.  Explaining that he wasn't happy, Dominic wasn't happy.  No more fat pills, or whatever the fuck it's called.  The ex is hopping on the back of some Hells Angels bike.  Yeah.  Great.  You're absolutely right.  Okay.  You're just sitting there playing poker.  I love that.  Bang chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was terrible. 
[00:42:00]  Fucking waving that big cock around.  Yeah.  In every room in the house.  Every room in the house.  Is that what I do?  People tripping over it.  Yeah.  I love the perception of my house.  I remember one time I went into Ann's house, and I was like, why do you have that fucking  50 cal on the table?  It was just this big cock laying there in between the hors d'oeuvres.  People didn't even notice it after a while.  I wish I remembered that.  Yeah.  You were drinking.  Oh, well, that explains it.  You want to eat something?  Yeah.  I'm so bummed I'm missing your fucking Halloween party.  I want you to go. 
[00:42:30]  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's going to be a big one.  Fuck.  Just like your penis.  Yeah.  Wednesday's actually Halloween?  Not this Wednesday.  Yeah, next Wednesday.  I like doing the before, because after Halloween, you can't have a Halloween.  It's a rip-off.  It's like having a Christmas party on New Year's.  Who the fuck's going to do that?  It's like once it's done, and there's no anticipation to it, it's silly.  So you've got to have it the weekend before Halloween.  Plus it's November.  You go to a Halloween party in November.  Yeah.  Now it's Thanksgiving?  It's Thanksgiving.  You start thinking turkey. 
[00:43:00]  Like, I like to put the turkey things up.  The day after Halloween, the skeletons and the goblins come down, and the turkey goes up.  The turkey comes up.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  The cornucopia I put out.  What's that?  That's that little horn with all the stuff falling out of it.  Is that what that's called?  A cornucopia.  Yeah.  Yeah, the horn.  I thought it was a horn with pubes.  It's the horn of plenty, they call it. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know why, but as a kid, it always reminded me of vomit.  Cornucopia?  Yeah, cornucopia is reminding me of vomit.  It's like a mouth throwing stuff up.  It kind of is.  But I'm talking like as a real little kid, like six years old.  That food hasn't been digested.  It's just reminding me of vomit.  Sometimes.  Your vomit isn't digested.  That's true.  What an awful basket.  The thing, the implications is someone brought a basket over and just put it down and all  the shit fell out of it.  But that stuff won't even fit in the basket.  No.  So how do they get it into the house?  That basket is so full.  It's full and it's stupid stuff. 
[00:44:00]  Like you could eat the grapes right there, but we can take a bite into the gourd.  And then that stupid corn that you can't eat, just hang it on your door.  The fuck is that shit?  Yeah, horn of plenty stinks.  Horn of plenty?  Horn of plenty.  Cornucopia.  I've never heard that.  Yeah, I remember that as a kid.  Oh.  Big fucking mouth vomiting.  All right.  All right.  Well, take a break. 
[00:44:30]  Take a break.  And get some neat.  And by the way, at the Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa show, the cheat show, I heard Colin, I didn't  hear it, but Colin Quinn, because I guess Bob and DeRosa did a thing before on stage, and  Colin Quinn said they were King Kong Bundy and Rachel Maddow.  Fucking greatest description of two idiots I've ever heard.  Oh, that was fucking great. 
[00:45:00]  I'm like, oh God, that must have fucking slayed.  Yes.  All right.  Oh, man.  Colin's great.  I think Joe's popping in.  Yes, let me think of it.  DeRosa.  He'll be popping in.  Do we have any Jocktober today, you think?  I'm working on something.  So Jocktober's taking a bit of a hiatus.  Right.  I got no problem.  I got no problem with that.  There's a show I have to listen to for a few days in a row.  Oh.  Do we have some jingles?  Yes, we can have some new jingles.  Oh, some jingles.  It's getting a lot of Iraq Army tweets over the weekend. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I noticed that.  I got a lot of those.  Iraq Army nigga.  Yeah, yeah.  And we're in a whole bunch of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll take a break.  We'll be right back.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The Opie Realtor Show. 
[00:46:00]  Let's see.  Is it?  Ah.  Yeah.  Now the big thing is see if you rock puts the full song on or just the loop.  I like the full song.  So you're searching for an angel.  Someone who can make you home.  Right now.  Who's this?  Stabbing Westward?  Is it?  Yeah.  I think it's Stabbing Westward, yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Stabbing Westward.  Stabbing Westward.  They're one of those 90s.  Sounds like Stabbing Assholes, these queers.  Ah, come on.  This is good.  Oh, jeez.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Joe Garoso joining us to just insult my musical taste.  I fit right into that 90s musical crutch.  It just doesn't even sound like 90s music.  It's like, oh, that just sounds like a good rock and roll song.  Yeah.  And then everybody else has to be like, no.  That's like incredibly dated music.  That's really 90s.  What are you going to do, though?  That just sounds like rock to me. 
[00:47:00]  This is just rocking.  It sounds like a good old-fashioned, wholesome song.  Doesn't everybody sing through a megaphone?  Exactly.  The megaphone sound on the vocals.  That's timeless, isn't it?  That was big in the 90s.  A lot of bands where the singer, you know, was a special song.  Yeah, he'd pull out the megaphone.  Here we go.  Here comes Cracker Man.  I am.  I'm smiling.  Keep me doing it.  Yeah.  I am a number one. 
[00:47:30]  I'm going to give you me a good night nightmare.  Yeah.  I am a number one.  That sounds very 90s.  He does it in this one, too.  Gotta get away.  Gotta get away.  Who's this?  Stonehenge.  Stonehenge.  Yeah.  Another bullhorn song.  That was all big.  Yeah.  Something about the music from the 90s, like everything from the 90s, all of a sudden 
[00:48:00]  just became, like, dated somewhere in the 2000s.  That's what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Same thing as the 80s.  I understand, but you don't know exactly, you don't know exactly when it happened.  I understand, but you can't really pinpoint it when it all of a sudden, because I notice  I'm watching, like, some 90s indie movies.  It's like, this shit just ain't, like, all cool anymore.  I don't think it's something that you could pinpoint.  It's, it's, I think it's personally for everyone. 
[00:48:30]  Like, I noticed it when, like, when I'd be driving around with, like, girlfriends and  I'm rocking and they're just like, what is this old man rocking out to?  And I'm like, oh shit, this isn't cool anymore.  So you don't even personally, like, hear it?  Like, you don't hear it yourself?  What, like, the age of it?  Right.  No.  Wow.  This is awesome.  I'll listen to this every day for the rest of my life.  Try driving around with a 21-year-old listening to the Ramones.  You've never seen a pussy dry up faster.  I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting for this music to, like, come back to be retro so it  could be cool again, because then I'm like, yeah, fuck it, all right, it's not double 
[00:49:00]  pilots.  It is, though, it's like, it's like when milk goes bad, though.  You're like, it was good, Tuesday, fine.  Well, when, when did it go bad?  When did it go bad?  And then some people can smell it and go, eh, it's still okay.  Yeah.  And drink it.  And other people, it's like, that's disgusting.  It's fine for cereal.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, see, it's kind of a...  Yeah, if you like it too long, then you're like the dad that drinks it after the date.  It's fine, what's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You don't understand good stuff. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I wasted it.  What is it, what is, what is 2000 to 2010?  What's, like, you know 80s music, you know 90s music, what's, what's that?  You can't define a decade until enough of it goes by.  It's so hard to do.  Like, no one really knew the 80s looked silly with the fucking shoulder pads and the wacky  hair and stuff until into the 90s.  Do you think that the last of rock, like, what, the period that you're trying to describe,  like, from 2000 to 2010, would you say, like, new, new metal, you know, that kind of genre, 
[00:50:00]  like, new metal and, like, pop rock?  Like, like, so you want to be a rock superstar kind of shit?  Was that what took over?  I don't know.  Auto-tuning was very big.  I think in the early 2000s, like, the first decade of the 2000s is mainly, like, pop, boy  band, bubblegum stuff.  Yeah.  Well, I was focusing more, like, on the rock area, but yeah, you're right.  But that's, that's every decade.  Like, even, you know, you had fucking, uh, what's some of the fucking, uh, the new kids  and shit, the new kids on the block. 
[00:50:30]  Like, there's always the boy bands.  Menudo in the fucking 80s.  So, like, what's the rock of the...  Like, the rock shit, what, what, what, like, defines the music of the 90s was grunge, right?  Yeah.  80s was hairband fucking shit.  Probably rap rock.  Then...  Linkin Park.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was saying.  That's still, like, late 90s, though, man.  I swear, you won't get a true vision of what the 2000s were until well into, like, like,  maybe 2014, around there, you'll start realizing, hey, remember the... 
[00:51:00]  The fucking 2000s.  Maybe it was, maybe it was the decade of the mashup.  The mashup.  Not, not, not the morning mashup.  The actual, the actual song mashup.  The morning mashup.  They had 40 minutes this year.  You always, like, yeah, maybe when you look back and you realize something's kind of douchey  and feels old, that's when, that's when it's defined.  Then you're stuck on, right, right.  Uh, uh, uh.  Well, the 2000, the first 10 years were, it is mashup very, it's very, like, there was a  lot of, like, retro stuff.  There was, like, there was, like, the boy band comeback thing. 
[00:51:30]  From the, from the 80s again.  Yeah.  And then.  Rock ramp.  Like, but also, like, Matchbox 20 and all that stuff was, that's, right?  Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Kid Rock.  Right.  The Limp Bizkit was in the 90s, too, though.  That's considered more of a...  I think the Limp Bizkit was set, but it was just the late 90s and then it bled over into  the early 2000s.  Yeah?  I definitely think that that's going to be, like, a first decade 2000s.  I, I know.  I think I know what this era is.  It's just one of those days. 
[00:52:00]  Ugh.  These guys are the fucking worst.  They were awesome for a second.  They were awesome for a second.  They were for a second.  For a second.  Okay.  They were like, like, Limp Bizkit was like, holy shit, this is an awesome band.  You're right.  And then it was like, you know what?  When did Fred Durst become a tool?  Was it when his naked dick pictures came out?  No, it was way before that.  Oh, it was.  Okay.  I think it was when, when, when Nookie became, like, this big hit.  You know, he did it all for that, though.  Yeah.  So you could take Nookie.  I did it all for Nookie?  How does that go? 
[00:52:30]  I don't remember that one.  The Nookie.  That was the, I think that was the turning point.  I did it all for the Nookie.  He doesn't say that.  Yes.  That's the hook.  Come on.  That's the big hook.  So you could take that cookie.  This is probably the biggest song they had.  It's digging up your head.  Come on.  Oh, God.  I saw these guys get booed off stage in Philly.  Really?  Yeah, they opened up for Faith No More.  They got booed off stage.  Damn.  They were opening up for Faith No More.  Before anybody knew who they were.  And he goes.  They got booed before, like, before they were famous?  Nobody knew who they were.  And Roddy Bottom, the keyboard player for Faith No More, is gay. 
[00:53:00]  And everybody was booing Limp Bizkit because they were like, you guys, this sucks.  Like, this fucking sucks.  And three songs in Fred Durst goes, hey, I saw the gay rights table in the back of the room.  I didn't invite you dick-sucking faggots to my show.  Oh, hey.  And the whole audience booed them off stage.  They smashed their equipment.  And I was like, these guys are going nowhere.  And then literally three months later, MTV Beach House.  Yeah.  One of those days is a good song.  This is fucking horrendous. 
[00:53:30]  Wait till the hook comes.  This rap shit stinks.  This was like the rock rap shit.  Yeah.  This was huge.  Eminem's the only one that can do it without being a fucking complete rash.  He's more rap.  That's what I'm saying.  This rock rap with it, it played their instruments.  And it was a rock fucking rock music, but the vocal was rappy.  Here it comes.  I did it all for the nookie.  Oh, the nookie.  This fucking shit stinks.  I never heard this. 
[00:54:00]  You never heard this?  The parrots.  No.  I probably shut my ears off.  I do this thing when I have songs on them.  I don't like it.  I fold my ears down and staple them.  That's probably what I did when this was on.  Did you ever hear their cover of Faith?  No.  By George Michael.  Did you like that one, Joe Garosa?  Their first big single.  Can you play that?  Yeah, good fucking.  But Faith made him famous.  Yeah.  It's the worst.  Faith is such a great song.  Yeah.  I loved it.  When this song came out, I liked it. 
[00:54:30]  Come on.  I did.  At first.  At first, I liked it.  It was just like, oh, they're covering Faith, because I remembered it as a kid.  And I'm like, how are you going to make this fucking song rock?  And then when they started screaming.  I mean, it didn't really.  In hindsight, it didn't really.  They were screaming on this one.  But for the time, it was like, all right, that rocks.  It was awesome for a minute.  For a second.  So far, this is okay.  Oh, wait till the heavy part kicks in.  I liked it.  Because it's got a rock.  You know, I'm looking at the top ten songs from 2000 to 2009.  Oh, okay.  And you can really see a progression here. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It totally goes from the early 2000s.  The first part of the decade was really like, I'll call it iPod rock.  Like indie rock.  And guys that were getting big.  Like Frans Ferdinand.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking, oh, hang on.  We got to wait for the hook here.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  I'm showing you that door.  Run.  Gonna have faith.  Gonna have faith.  Gonna have faith.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm in the mosh pit.  I'm in the pit. 
[00:55:30]  It's not fucking pit.  It's okay, except for that screaming part.  Yeah.  I love this when it came out.  When does it start?  The same thing with 2000s, right?  Isn't that the same thing with Rape?  I think they were late 90s or early 2000s.  What about Jimmy just said?  It's okay, except for that screaming part.  I see Linkin Park.  It's terrible.  They still had a top 10 song in 2000.  Who did?  So Linkin Park.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it did still carry over a bit.  Oh, in the end.  I never liked them either.  Outkast.  What do we got? 
[00:56:00]  Fucking Coldplay.  But you got bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes.  These guys are making the top 10 on the list.  But then you start getting into the later half.  And you guys, you got like Amy Winehouse, Norse Barkley, Justin Timberlake, T.I., Beyonce,  Shakira.  And the only thing even close to rock is Muse.  Wow, look at that.  You're right.  I mean, Red Hot Chili Peppers is always going to have a big song if they put an album out.  So I don't even count that.  This decade.  No, I really do.  The more I was thinking about it, I think it is the indie rock decade. 
[00:56:30]  Because now, in the last four years, it's been a lot of, like, the computer rock stuff.  And the early, you know, Kings of Leon.  Okay.  You know, that sort of thing was really, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, that stuff was all really big.  Yeah, that's true.  I think that'll be the defining.  That stuff and the Beyonce stuff.  And I don't see any more, like, the indie rock thing.  Even that's coming to a crawl.  Because, obviously, it's not, you know, they're not really, those kinds of songs aren't showing up in the top 10s anymore.  So, I guess rock is just really seriously over now. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, there's three people.  Now it's all, look at the last year's, like, fucking Lady Gaga's just, like, dominating the list.  I got a feeling.  Black Eyed Peas.  Boom Boom Pal.  Black Eyed Peas.  Empire State of Mind.  Jay-Z.  My Girls.  Animal.  I don't even know what that is, actually.  Animal Collective.  While You Wait for the Others.  Grizzly Bear.  Sexy Bitch.  David Guetta.  Grizzly Bear is indie rock.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  I don't know a lot of that.  I mean, I know the bands, but what about, I'm talking about the rock.  The rock is still, because they said it was dead, like, you always say the rock is dead. 
[00:57:30]  Every group, every, like, decade you hear, like, rock is not.  Yeah.  But then, like, when you look back, you're like, oh, yeah, that was just a weird form.  Well, it goes through little phases.  Yeah.  It's in a.  Strange place.  Downturn right now, but it's not dead.  And the heroes, and the heroes of rock and roll right now are basically the kings of grunge from the 90s.  Yeah.  Dave Grohl.  Dave Grohl, Green Day.  Jack White.  Yeah.  I think what, always when they say the rock is dead thing, it's like, and this does seem to keep happening worse and worse every decade. 
[00:58:00]  Even with the rap rock stuff, it's like, the teeth just keep getting taken out of it.  Like, indie rock is still out there, but it's very, like, emotional and sort of pussified.  That started happening in the late 90s with emo music and, like, Dashboard Conventional and all that stuff.  And even with the rap rock, none of it really had any real teeth.  It just sounded like a guy doing what he thought the idea of tough was.  Of him being angry man.  Meanwhile, it's like, yeah, you know.  But, like, you know, stuff like Metallica and, you know what I mean, like, real, like, fucking, like, you know, Motorhead, stuff like that. 
[00:58:30]  Like, that doesn't exist anymore.  Like, the guy with the bottle of whiskey, chain smoking, I don't give a fuck, I'm going to say whatever I want.  Fuck the Grammys, whatever.  Yeah.  You know, like, I don't know.  It just doesn't seem like he has any nuts to it anymore.  That's either absolutely true or you're old.  Oh, boy.  That's, like, that's pretty much it.  It's harder to find.  Is it?  It's harder to find.  You can't, like, make old music sound like, this was great and now it doesn't have this without sounding old. 
[00:59:00]  You know some music is old when you're fucking a girl, and I only fuck younger girls, and they're talking about, well, you were there, and they talk about, I don't know who that band is, and you're like, really?  Like, am I that much fucking older?  Like, that's how much music has changed.  You talk about someone from 98 or whatever, they're like, no, I don't.  I'm like, 98.  Or whatever, you know.  2007.  You know what, though?  I don't think, I don't think that's always a product of age, though. 
[00:59:30]  I think that's got a lot to do with the information, the information fucking influx that's going on right now.  And the fact that I sleep with girls with Down syndrome.  That's probably, that also contributes to it.  It's not just the music.  They don't understand anything.  Yeah.  When I say, when they say, what song is that?  I'm like, it's just people banging two pots together, and that's not music.  My favorite song comes out of a music box. 
[01:00:00]  But fucking, people can't remember shit from 10 fucking minutes ago.  You know what I mean?  Like, they don't remember yesterday, let alone, I meet comedians now, young comedians, that don't know who, like, George Corlin is and stuff.  Wow, that's fucking weird.  No, not young comedians.  I swear to you.  I swear to you, dude.  I'm not lying.  How long ago did Corlin die?  2008.  2008?  I mean, young comedians now that go, Bob Newhart, who is? 
[01:00:30]  Newhart I can understand, but only because he's not, Corlin was a prolific stand-up until he died, and he's much more of a legend in stand-up than Newhart.  Newhart's a TV legend, really.  But wow, to not know Corlin is a comic.  Yeah, that's something.  Must be awful comics.  But I think it's also just being a product of, you know, when you're looking at something brand new every five minutes for the last five fucking years, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, knowing stuff from 1970-whatever, I mean, it's just, it's so fucking fleeting at this point. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, but I never saw Mom's Mabley live, but I fucking know who she is.  Like, Clockwork Orange was made when I was three, and I knew what it was when I was fucking 14.  Yeah, but you didn't grow up, my point is you didn't grow up with the internet, though.  Yes, I did.  It's a really weird thing.  I had it.  No one else did.  There was a secret in your house.  I would say, I'm going online now, and I'd be like, what do you mean?  I'd be like, you'll know.  That's true.  Yeah, I think it's because of the internet.  Maybe it's a big part.  People learn and process stuff faster and get rid of it faster. 
[01:01:30]  It is amazing when you think about what you used to have to go through before the internet.  I mean, just not knowing things.  Just not knowing it.  And no way to get that information at all, unless, like, the library was open and you felt so inclined to go.  So, like, it was, now, like, trivial information, you used to just wonder what it was.  You wouldn't go to the library to find out who was in a certain movie or something.  Now you just, bah, it's easy.  Trivial.  But you know what else, too?  You always blame the, you always are who you are, I guess, too, to contradict what I just said. 
[01:02:00]  I always blame the, you know, I blame the internet now.  I go, I fucking can't retain any goddamn information that's coming at me too fast.  When the internet wasn't around, I would be like, I guess I'll never know that because I'm not going to go to the library right now.  Yeah, so instead of knowing it, it's the same thing, but now you just don't know it.  Like, that's what it would be.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Because if you wanted to, you could use the internet to look up all the information on these old, you know, comedians or musicians or whatever. 
[01:02:30]  If you were so inclined to have that information.  If you were so inclined, Sam.  If you had the inclination.  Many obviously do not.  Many do not.  It's terrible.  Yeah, friends would have encyclopedias over their house, and sometimes you'd just grab one.  You'd have to go over to their house to do a project because you didn't have a set of encyclopedias.  Because they had encyclopedias.  So they did.  So you'd have to go over.  Hey, can I come over to your house and use your encyclopedias?  M, let me see.  Mesopotamia.  Let me see. 
[01:03:00]  You're missing M.  Oh, yeah.  M's gone.  Fuck.  Or right at the beginnings of the internet when they would give you like a whole encyclopedia on a CD-ROM.  Well, I remember when my dad brought home Encarta.  Yeah, Encarta.  That sucked so bad.  And I was like, oh, shit.  I got everything right here on a computer?  What was that?  I remember that.  It had like four discs.  So you had to put in different discs for the letters.  Right.  But it was an encyclopedia on CD-ROM.  So it was the first time all this information could be on your computer.  That's if Obama's standing next to Jimmy Carter. 
[01:03:30]  Remember when you'd go to a library?  Jesus.  What did you call it?  Encarta.  It was designed for Windows 95.  I used it on a Mac, though.  Jesus Christ.  On a Mac?  What are you, crazy back then?  I never had this thing.  I never had Encarta.  Come on.  Or would you be like...  Just got it easy.  But it would be like, we only bought up to L.  Yeah, yeah.  Then we defaulted on our fucking encyclopedias.  Dad didn't pay. 
[01:04:00]  It was like Columbia House.  Yeah.  Because they would.  They'd send you like a certain amount of encyclopedias over time, and you'd have to pay for it.  So, yeah, you'd get to like fucking...  We never made it past the introductory A, B.  Oh, God.  And if you went to...  I knew everything about aardvarks.  Apples.  Yes.  That's good.  Why don't I just take a funny word and then say apples?  Fucking zilch.  We should get to D, and I can do double punchlines.  Go to R for ruined jokes. 
[01:04:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Have you guys seen what Windows 8 looks like yet?  No.  What does it look like?  It's pretty terrible.  Of course it is.  If you ask most people.  Windows is horrid.  Terrible.  What's the deal with Windows?  What's the deal with...  They're trying to make it look like a tablet.  It's actually...  It was built for a tablet.  Whoa.  It looks very cartoony.  Where'd it go?  There we go.  Is that it?  Yeah.  That's fucking...  And they're just trying to make it look like apps and icons.  They're trying to do the Mac thing, because that's the format they have on the Windows phone. 
[01:05:00]  That's how the Windows phone is set up.  Yes.  They want you...  They want everything to look the same.  So they want the phone.  They want the consoles.  And they want the...  I just don't...  I just can't...  I don't like Windows anymore.  I hate the ball of my Mac all the time.  If I could just use Windows XP forever and ever, I'll do that.  XP was one of the best operating systems ever.  It's stable.  It doesn't crash.  I don't have problems.  And it works.  I love XP.  Can't you just use that or no?  Yeah.  After a while.  Sometimes you go, oh, I'm really falling behind the curve.  I really feel like an old person, because everybody's using all these new operating systems. 
[01:05:30]  And here I am with my 10, 15-year-old Windows XP.  So then you go and try to upgrade to something new, and you try to work it, and you go, this  really doesn't work.  It works less than it used to work.  And he's listening to Collective Soul on Windows XP.  Yes, but you know what?  I have become cumbersome.  You know what?  And cumbersome rules?  Yeah, of course.  That song stinks.  I don't know cumbersome.  You rock?  With a C, not a K. 
[01:06:00]  But you know what?  My PC won't crash.  Yeah.  Windows XP.  And I'm rocking really hard at the same time.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out why his Napster won't connect.  Damn.  Napster?  I'm using Kaza.  Oh, yeah.  This song's okay.  Yeah.  See, this still just sounds like music to me.  This is just rock.  This is just a good rock song.  This is very dangerous.  You don't like this?  I'm in the minority today.  No, I never liked it.  Because it came out after Pearl Jam and Stone Devil Pilots, and it was another guy trying to 
[01:06:30]  sound Eddie Vedder-ish to me, so I didn't like it.  Do you like Pearl Jam and Stone Devil Pilots?  Yes.  I don't.  I like Pearl...  You don't like Pearl Jam?  No.  Really?  Detest them.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, I fucked up.  It doesn't get me.  Stone Devil Pilots are like the first two albums.  After that, it's done.  You don't like to test them?  No.  No.  That's a pick.  No?  Who do you like from the 90s?  Do you like Soundgarden?  They're okay, but...  Yeah, but are you biased with Stone Devil Pilots because you hate What's-His-Face so much?  Like, if you could just take the personal feelings away, could you get into it? 
[01:07:00]  I like a lot of the music from the 90s.  I think the musicians were good, but I don't like a lot of the singing.  Like, I just don't like that style.  I'm not saying that they stink.  I just don't like it.  Like, Nirvana kind of grew on me after...  Opie actually fucking forced Nirvana onto me, and I was like, yeah, they're all good.  It was so nice, though, to get away from nothing but that high-pitched, girly, falsetto  singing of the 80s.  Right.  Like, if you were in a cover band in the 80s, you were fucked if you couldn't sing that 
[01:07:30]  high.  Right.  You could just...  When the 90s rolled around and you got some of the grunge bands that were coming out, it  was like, oh, finally, I could go out there and sing fucking new songs.  Right.  Just that birch.  And if your voice cracked, it was cool.  Yeah, it was fine.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Play a Soundgarden song.  I mean, I know them, but...  Oh, my God.  The whole 90s.  Black Hole Sun was their big hit.  I just didn't give a fuck about music in the 90s.  I listened to fucking Sabbath on my cassette player going to do gigs.  Everybody else could fucking eat my ass.  I didn't want to hear it. 
[01:08:00]  Fucking Jimmy just listening to a band from the 70s.  Give me a live, too.  I'll put that on and fucking drive to this fucking college for 300 bucks.  This is a crappy Soundgarden song.  But it was the big hit.  If Jimmy knows a song, it'll be this one.  That's why I decided.  We go through this break once every, say, three weeks.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, me not knowing.  But I really don't know it.  Oh, yeah, I've heard this.  Yeah, you know this.  I like that Jim, he skipped 90s rock, but then he decided it was time to start getting  current with music when Lady Gaga came out. 
[01:08:30]  I love her.  Fucking Katy Perry.  I don't like Katy Perry.  Oh, no?  She's okay.  You like her hits?  Yeah.  Like her lick of...  I saw John Mayer recently.  I kissed his lips just to have gotten to her breasts.  He fucking...  He was railing some popular women, wasn't he?  Didn't he fuck...  What's her name for his friends?  Aniston.  Jennifer Aniston?  He's a fucking machine, the guy.  Taylor Swift?  Taylor Swift?  Did he date Taylor Swift?  No way! 
[01:09:00]  Shut the fuck up.  He was with Taylor Swift?  He's got to be all cock, because he's a big, tall guy.  He's got to have a fuck.  He's got to be packing nine.  That's probably what it is.  He probably ruins them.  Jesus Christ.  This motherfucker.  Yeah.  This motherfucker.  John Mayer...  Kristen Stewart?  Well, no.  What?  No, no, no.  They were just saying that they were at Katy Perry's birthday party.  Oh!  But Katy Perry and John Mayer are an item.  Now they are?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know he's probably banging her better than fucking Russell did.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah, he's probably putting that deep soul dick into her. 
[01:09:30]  A fucking...  A pained musical dicking, and he can't sing for a while because his throat's healing.  So he's probably taking it all out on her.  The best cocksmith in music, I think, might have to be John Mayer.  It's either John Mayer or Adam Duritz.  I don't know who.  John Mayer is fucking...  Yeah, Duritz is a fucking...  He's an animal.  Who does he bang, though?  Who does George bang?  He fucked, like, half of the girls from Friends, like, in a row.  Really?  Yeah, and right when they broke, like, right when it was, like, they were the It Girls.  Really?  What songs does he sing?  Counting Crows.  It's more emo.  It's very light.  Mr. Jones.  Mr. Jones and me. 
[01:10:00]  I hate that.  Oh, that song is okay.  I like that.  I hated that band.  You know what else I hated for?  Another fucking Crows.  Black Crows.  Hate the Black Crows.  No, you can't hate the Black Crows.  La, la, la, la, la.  You can't hate the Black Crows.  Hate the Black Crows.  They're right up your fucking gun shooting alley.  They're so not.  Let me hear Black Crows.  I need a Rambo D.  Shut up.  I hate the Black Crows.  I want to hear that.  What's the guy's name?  Play some Black Crows.  Who's thanks for them?  Chris? 
[01:10:30]  Chris Robinson.  Chris Robinson.  He was banging out.  It has to be.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, do I fucking hate this.  Try to keep it over my head.  It's some kind of.  70s-ish sound.  Trying to.  Stones want to be a little bit.  I like the Black Crows.  I mean, some of the style.  I don't know all of them. 
[01:11:00]  Come on, man.  You don't feel this, man.  No.  I was in two bands with that word,  Crows in it.  Oh, there's plenty of those.  Baby, baby, why can't you sit still?  Oh, dear Blackbird, I'm on your window seat.  Sounds like Dylan.  You don't like that he says window seal?  See?  Yeah, he's a very effective voice on this guy.  I don't think this is terrible.  It's MSNBC shit. 
[01:11:30]  He's wearing an Obama shirt.  Sorry.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of this music here.  No.  This is their cover of the Otis Redding song.  No, it's a cover of Hard to Hear.  This is like their first big hit.  Oh, I heard it.  Yeah.  I didn't know this was...  Whose music is that?  No, no, no.  What's the Otis Redding song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they got better after these two albums.  Amorica was their third album,  and that's like their best album. 
[01:12:00]  And that's when they became cultish.  Or cult-hiddish.  It's terrible.  I didn't know this was them.  That part makes me squirm a little bit,  but, you know, I don't...  I hate it.  It's better than cumbersome.  Nah, this is too...  How does cumbersome go? 
[01:12:30]  Bluesy-oriented.  Did we hear that already?  That's when they were just playing.  Again, though, it's pretty sweet.  You just listened to it.  It's pretty sweet.  Remember this from 15 minutes ago?  Yeah, from 15 minutes ago.  Now we're doing the break every 15 minutes.  This is not familiar.  Iroh, play the shit part where he goes,  too wrong or too right.  Too black or too white.  That's my favorite part.  The shit part, he calls it.  The shit part.  We just listened to this?  Yeah.  What the fuck was I doing? 
[01:13:00]  It's every 90s song, by the way.  You were listening to Sabbath in your head.  Yes, I was.  You had the honest cassette player.  The cassette player, and everyone else could eat your ass.  I'm hearing Sweet Leaf right now.  I don't know what you're listening to.  Come on, this is good.  Right?  You like this?  I did it.  Oh, yeah.  Scrake that chord, man.  You fucking creep.  Oh, this is collective soul.  This is Seven Mary Three.  No, Seven Mary Three. 
[01:13:30]  Really?  Seven Mary Three, by the way, was a reference from Chips.  What's that?  Fuck.  Seven Mary Three, yes.  I think it was Poncha's fucking call number.  Yeah, it was one of those, I guess, Seven Mary Three.  This doesn't sound at all current, by the way.  It's kind of what?  This is not even sort of current.  This song is from, like, 2003.  No.  Come on, man.  It's not even kind of current.  Why did I say that?  No.  It's like...  2003?  No.  No, this is basically 1994. 
[01:14:00]  Or 1995.  You lied by ten years, and I didn't know it.  You just cranked this up.  Let's go see that new Winona Ryder movie.  Old man Danny thinks that 2003, ten years ago, is current.  Look, other people are searching it out.  It's the second thing.  It's Seven Mary Three, and then the next thing is cumbersome.  Because they're not putting out new music.  Other people want to hear it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Too heavy, too light.  Too black, too white.  Too wrong, too right.  Yeah.  I can't look at Joe now.  It fucking sucks. 
[01:14:30]  Is that it, do you see?  It sucks.  Too rich or too porky.  Too rich or too porky.  He's on his stool, stomping his feet.  Oh, God, it fucking sucks.  He's saying something, though.  He's saying something.  Oh, yeah, and Water's Edge.  I like that song, too.  Water's Edge is a big song.  You know what a great 90s song is?  Possum Kingdom.  I'm just going to say that.  Of course you are.  I was just going to say that.  Of course you are.  Yes.  That's awesome that you just said that.  Fucking Toadies Possum Kingdom. 
[01:15:00]  Great 90s song is fucking Computer God.  I.  I is a great fucking song from 95.  Who does that?  Sabbath with Theo.  He's a humanizer.  This is not that, D-Rock.  This is great.  This is my iPhone.  Possum Kingdom, man.  Really?  This is a great tune.  Pretty miser.  I can't hear that.  What should I listen to, Sam?  Absolutely.  Jay-Z.  I'm right back in AF Studios doing this fucking place.  I remember fucking sitting there very vividly.  I don't know why this song's so much. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  I mean, we use it as a rejoinder.  Oh, that's how I mean.  I know it from here.  I always hate when I know something, but it's from here.  The song had a little bit of a rebirth in the last couple of, well, I guess the last  like four or five years.  It still gets played.  It was on like the Guitar Hero 2 game soundtrack, so it kind of blew up for another generation  a little bit.  Because they got to play all the time.  I'll not be a gentleman.  Oh.  Come on.  This is good shit.  No.  Don't dig this.  No.  I like that they did a big single and it wasn't in 4-4. 
[01:16:00]  I thought that was actually very impressive that somebody got away with it.  Come on.  It's great.  No.  Jim just goes, ah.  Who sings this?  The Toadies.  The Toadies.  They didn't have many hits.  But you know what's weird?  This is their only song like this.  All the rest of their stuff is very like fast and like punk.  Yeah.  Punk sort of.  No.  No one else knows that either.  I'm not a 90s music fan.  90s was the big fucking resurgence in rock.  I respect that.  I like Nirvana, but even them I took 12 years to like. 
[01:16:30]  And I started liking them in probably 2000s.  I only listened to three bands in the 90s.  Cobain's brains were gone for six years before I started to enjoy it.  It was brainless for six years.  What did you listen to in the 90s, Sam?  Only albums I listened to.  Smash by The Offspring all the time.  That album is awesome.  Remember The Offspring?  Is that a good song?  Ripping off every other band.  Well, every song they had.  Their big single was Come Out and Play.  Yeah.  You know that song.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy, you've got to know that song.  Jimmy knows every song he says he doesn't know.  You know this song.  Keep Em Separate.  Yeah, I love this.  I fucking love this song when it came out.  This is one of the few albums I listen to over and over again.  Driving scene in every 90s fucking indie movie.  I still put this album on.  This album is still solid.  Their first two albums, their album before this is great, too.  Admission.  Who is this?  Everything after this is pretty terrible, though.  They get real shitty real quick. 
[01:17:30]  They became like a goof band.  Yeah, this sound's kind of old.  It's like, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I listen to the 90s?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I listen to an Out Come the Wolves Rancid album.  Yeah, but Let's Go is the great Rancid album.  The one before Out Come the Wolves.  Out Come the Wolves had all those singles.  That's how I mean.  I didn't know anything about punk music.  And then White Zombie.  I never liked White Zombie.  I like Rob Zombie, but I never liked White Zombie.  I don't like his music.  I loved White Zombie from when I was in like sixth grade.  What's a big song from White Zombie?  Because I know Rob Zombie's stuff much more than theirs. 
[01:18:00]  More Human Than Human is the big song.  Ah, more Human Than Human.  And Thunder Kiss 65, too, right?  Thunder Kiss 65.  Supercharger Heaven.  I don't know that one.  I told you.  I watched a girl suck her boyfriend's dick to White Zombie music when I was doing a  fucking gig in Lancaster in like 93.  You don't know what song it was?  No.  I was too busy fucking obsessing over her juicy ass.  Come on. 
[01:18:30]  It's chivalrous.  He's got his own sound though, Zombie, man.  It's fucking zombie rules.  Yeah, I like them too.  What a bunch of fucking assholes.  Yeah!  Fuck you, yeah!  Fucking rocking now.  I mixed up White Zombie with Rob Zombie.  Yeah!  When this song came out, I was still in high school.  I was at home with my mom's, and I had the flu, like 102 fever flu, and I was on the  couch in a fucking daze, and I had MTV on back when they used to play videos. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And this, every fucking hour, I was just in like some hallucinogenic flu state.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I am the crowd.  Yeah!  Amazing.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Sounds like, sounds like Stone Cold Steve Austin singing a song.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  This fucking kicks ass. 
[01:19:30]  Come on.  Yeah, Rob Zombie is fucking good, man.  Actually, he sounds like Macho Man.  That's what I was thinking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's, it's, he's too solid.  What's his last name for real?  I mean.  Rob Cummings?  Vampire.  Zombie isn't his name?  Yeah.  That would have been coincidental.  He was kidding, calling himself Rob Monster.  Yeah, but it's spelled with an X.  Rob Monster.  Oh, that would be very scary, indeed.  Yes, it would.  Rob Zombie, what is he running around like a dead person?  Can you, can we hear Thunderkiss 65? 
[01:20:00]  Well, that's the one, man.  Try Supercharger Heaven.  I'll bet you know Supercharger Heaven.  I'll only hear Thunderkiss.  We all hear Thunderkiss.  Yeah, where the hell are you?  Thunderlips in the flesh, baby.  This is a great fucking, this, this riff is awesome.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Fucking zombie riffs rule.  They really do.  Come on.  Talk about rock.  Sometimes they take a minute to get started.  Yeah, they do.  You gotta go through it as little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went through a period where I was, uh. 
[01:20:30]  This isn't Thunderkiss.  Went through your period.  This is Supercharger Heaven.  Good one.  He rocked one with me instead of the room.  Good one, He rocked.  I was trying to find, uh, every, like, movie drop that's in his songs.  Yeah.  Like, I was trying to find every movie.  I haven't found every single one, but, like, because I used to freak out when I'd be watching  an old horror movie and, like, the line from the beginning of this would be in it.  Oh, and then you'd be like, ah.  Like, holy shit, that's in the song.  Play Thunderkiss, you fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the one. 
[01:21:00]  This is part of, like, that, the Manson explosion stuff.  And DCW used to use this as their beginning theme, and I was like, really?  It's awesome.  It's wrestling and white zombie.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Would you?  See, you just finally, you're admitting that the 90s was the best ever.  This part.  Just jizzing all over his pants.  Great music.  Great wrestling.  Yeah.  The 90s.  The wrestling was good in the 90s.  Oh, Marilyn Manson I like a lot.  Marilyn Manson?  Yeah.  Nah, nah, nah.  One of the best live shows I've ever seen in my life was Marilyn Manson. 
[01:21:30]  And I'm not into his albums.  Yeah.  Ron Zombie's a really good live, too.  I've seen Zombie 30 times, opening for Ozzy on OzFest.  Oh, right.  I've seen him many fucking times.  He's great, right?  Yeah, he is.  He's good shit, man.  Very theatrical.  Yeah.  And then, of course, 90s, of course, Alice in Chains.  Alice in Chains.  I've really been turned...  About a year ago, I was on the fence about Alice in Chains.  Yeah.  And after the pressures of you guys and some other people, I've really turned around. 
[01:22:00]  I really love them now.  Yeah, they're fucking great.  That was a definitive 90s band.  Rain When I Die is...  Yeah.  I mean, it could be a contender for the greatest song ever.  Wow.  What song?  That's a bold statement.  Rain When I Die by Alice in Chains.  I'm probably going to disagree with you, but let's hear it.  You have your own ideas?  Yeah.  They're not even one of my favorite bands, but this song, the fucking...  When it hits the first chorus, you're just like, holy shit. 
[01:22:30]  It's fucking devil music.  After I started listening to White Zombie, I was like, Jim, I refuse to listen to other bands.  Like, I couldn't appreciate any bands ever.  That's...  Zombie was your fucking...  Sabbath.  Yeah, yeah.  I was not paying attention to any Alice in Chains, any Soundgarden.  Damn!  I got to...  I'm going to turn my phones up for this shit.  It's got a long...  You got to get through this part, Jim.  Hold on.  It's all right.  I got to get through the beginning.  So disgusting. 
[01:23:00]  No, I'm not...  I don't hate Alice in Chains.  I mean, I like this stuff.  They're just fucking jamming here.  They didn't realize the rest of the world wasn't on heroin.  Right there.  Exactly.  This is fucking heroin music right here.  Yeah.  It's got this part.  Man.  Then it breaks into the main riff. 
[01:23:30]  Maybe I was feeling it.  You know what?  Not one of my favorites as far as Alice in Chains.  It's like, I think it's going to rain.  I like so many other ones that I like.  And I...  I mean, it's not one of my favorites.  You know where this comes from, this song.  I like the hits.  This is...  I won't say it's direct.  Uh-huh.  Getaway by Kiss.  It's off their second album.  Oh, my God.  Written by A.S.  Really.  Everything always comes back to either Kiss or fucking Sabbath. 
[01:24:00]  Getaway by Kiss.  It's fucking...  You got it, E. Rock?  E. Rock's got it.  Yeah, the chorus.  Great voice.  Yeah?  All right.  Let's...  Let's hear.  How we doing, everybody?  I want you to put your hands together.  It's labeled for Jim Norton use only in the last...  Is it for your show? 
[01:24:30]  Why?  Nobody else is playing this.  Oh.  This is Getaway?  By Kiss, yes.  Sell by Peter.  Hey, where'd Joe Scarborough buy that?  Getaway to leave me so proud.  But wait, you think this sounds like the Alice in Chains song?  No, I just want to hear it.  I lied.  You like this song?  I do. 
[01:25:00]  I love this song.  It sounds nothing like it.  No, no, no.  I know.  Just wanted to hear it.  Yeah.  You like this?  I love it.  It sounds so thin.  It's old.  It's like he's 73.  73?  This is fucking Kiss' second album, I think.  This is a Kiss song no one knows.  I know.  I'm not a big Kiss fan, but I feel like I'm missing something.  I feel like I should be, but I'm not. 
[01:25:30]  When I went to the Kiss show, I realized how little I actually know from Kiss.  I knew like two of their hits, and then everything else was like, I don't know what this is.  You know fucking Detroit Rock City.  Yeah, that was one.  I want to rock and roll all night.  Party every day.  That's not their best song, though.  Strutter.  No, not really.  What?  That's a good song.  I hate myself for loving you.  Play Deuce off a life.  Bad medicine.  You don't know Deuce.  Living on a prayer.  No, that's not going to be.  I'm just kidding.  Wait a minute. 
[01:26:00]  You don't know Deuce by Kiss?  No.  I don't know a lot of Kiss.  I don't.  In the 70s, I wasn't Kiss.  I was more fucking Peter Frampton in Boston.  Oh, fucking Jesus.  Wow.  Peter Frampton.  Wow.  You don't know Deuce?  No.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  You never heard this?  This isn't really... 
[01:26:30]  Maybe I'll know it when the vocals kick in, right?  I know.  I know it already.  I have no idea what this is.  Wow.  I would have known it was Kiss just from kind of the sound.  I wouldn't have.  But I don't know.  Yeah, this could have probably been 20 other bands.  Wow.  No.  No, I was fucking...  This sounds like Deep Purple to me.  It comes alive, does it?  A little bit. 
[01:27:00]  You like Deep Purple, boys?  I don't really listen to them.  Ant loves them.  It's a classic.  Yeah.  I like what I've heard, but...  What, Deep Purple?  Oh.  Crazy shit.  Space trucking?  Yeah.  Fucking...  That was some heavy stuff.  Burn?  Hey.  Oh, fuck.  And did you ever get to see them live?  No, I would go now to see them if I...  Yeah?  If they still tour...  It's just like the drummer and the singer now.  But that's not even...  Yeah.  It's like the heartbreaking thing to see bands like that tour now. 
[01:27:30]  I went to see Blois the Cult, and that was years ago.  And they were in a place where, while they were playing, I could just lean over to who  I was with and be like,  Hey.  Hey.  What do you think they sound like?  It was all low, and...  That's like...  It's like the difference between Rush and Yes.  Like, they're all in their 50s at this point.  And, like, Rush is still...  You know, Neil Peart's the second drummer, but it's Rush.  It's still the three guys.  And they still...  Their new album is, like, one of the best albums I've ever done. 
[01:28:00]  They just rip.  And then you go see Yes, and they're all wearing these, like, flowing robes.  And it's like...  There's, like, one of the original members in the band.  They're like,  We're just gonna focus on the stuff after Owner of a Lonely Heart.  You're like,  No, no, no.  Don't do that.  What?  Yeah, but Yes had never had a consistent lineup at all.  Like, they went through people, like people go...  Like, the guys go through girlfriends do.  They sound so fucking...  They don't do yours.  It's no disgrace.  Oh, dude.  I watched a live concert DVD of theirs once, one night.  Yeah.  And I was just sitting there the whole time because I wanted to hear stuff off of Close 
[01:28:30]  to the Edge and Fragile and all that stuff.  Uh-huh.  And I waited and waited for Roundabout, and they did an acoustic blues version of Roundabout.  I almost threw a fucking wrench through my TV set.  That's so fucking presumptuous.  The lead singer would get there the day before, I think John Anderson's name is, and sleep  on the stage when he could overnight in a tent.  Asshole.  He's just one of those guys.  An tent.  Weird guy.  What a dick.  That's like when you hear the stories about Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and they say  that Sean Penn slept on set so he could inhabit the role of Spicoli. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  Look, he was really good in that movie at all, but I mean, for Christ's sake.  No, but I know this is true.  No, no.  I'm saying it's...  What, he really did it?  No, yeah.  I'm not making that up.  I was agreeing.  He would?  Did you make your thing up?  No.  Oh, yeah, we're both telling the truth.  Fuck it, he would really sleep on the set.  Yeah, they said he would put a hammock on the set, because that's what Spicoli would do.  Oh, boy.  But it worked for him.  Oh, just act.  He's so good.  Don't try to become the person. 
[01:29:30]  Did you ever watch the Doors DVD?  The bonus feature is Oliver Stone's talking about how brilliant Val Kilmer was, and he goes,  he goes, Val insisted that he be called Jim starting two weeks into rehearsals.  I hate that shit.  Here's the best part.  Actors.  He goes, we send a memo out letting the cast and crew know they were only allowed to refer  to Val as Jim, and they're going through interviews with everybody, and they're all going, he was  so brilliant, and he was just in habit of the role.  They get to Frank Whaley, and Frank Whaley goes, yeah, I remember getting that memo. 
[01:30:00]  It said we were only allowed to refer to him as Jim.  From that point on, I only referred to Val as asshole.  And he goes, it helped my performance.  He didn't like him?  Yeah, he just, that's literally the whole clip.  He doesn't get into any more.  But I just love that he said that.  I hear he's a real jerk-off.  I've never met him, but I hear he's a twat.  Val's giant now.  I think on one of the Fast Times documentaries or something, they said Sean Penn did that  too.  You had to call him Spicoli or Jeff or whatever on set.  I give credit to it in hindsight.  Like, hearing about it makes you go, what a douche. 
[01:30:30]  But when you see what Sean Penn did, or what Val Kilmer did in that, it's like, God, it  worked.  Because they were fucking amazing.  When you're that good at something, it's like, whatever it takes.  Yeah.  I don't know, dude.  You think it really takes that?  Some of them are method weird actors, dude.  They could just get on in front of a camera without all that horse shit and still be  able to just act.  I think to reach that sort of legendary status like Sean Penn has.  You've got to be a dick bag.  Yeah, you've got to be a Salvador douche bag where you're going to put everybody. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, look, Richard Pryor, arguably the greatest comedian that ever lived, was probably  a fucking nightmare to be around as a human being.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, oh, he's doing coke again.  He's fucking his fucking assist.  Whatever shit he was.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, but you go, ah, look at the work.  He does good.  That special's really funny.  Right, right.  Louis tells a story about when he worked for Conan.  He had to do something, I think, with Martin Sheen.  And they had to talk to him on the phone about a sketch they were going to do when Sheen was 
[01:31:30]  on Conan.  And he said he was doing some play where he was playing either General Lee or one of those  guys from the Civil War.  And he said when he talked to Martin Sheen on the phone, I guess it was in between takes,  but he was talking like that.  Well, I would like to know.  That's what he does.  I think it's, what was that sequel to that?  Martin Sheen was playing Foghorn Leghorn.  I'll see, I'll see.  I did a very bad impression.  I keep hitting him and you keep missing him, son.  The boy's about as sharp as a sack of bowling balls. 
[01:32:00]  Sack of wet mice was always funny.  Sack of wet mice.  Because they're not sharp at all.  No.  That was, I think he was doing that, that Gettysburg sequel.  Oh, maybe, yeah.  Wasn't he?  Yeah.  He was like filming, I don't know.  Yeah.  I'll see, I'll see.  Was he really?  I was, no.  But he was talking like he was General Lee or whoever he was playing.  That's so weird.  Actors are fucking weirdos.  To get out of that character, like to get the, once you have a fucking, a speech pattern  down, it might be hard to break it and then get back into it ten minutes later. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Acting's fucking hard, man.  Louie Bean.  Exactly.  Ah, maybe he's just in character all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's like weird when you see, I was watching a blooper reel on a DVD last night  and they're like in the scene and then the actor, like they're in the cadence of the  scene, like, okay, we're going to, and then he goes, ah, shit, that wasn't the line.  I fucked it up.  Okay, let's do it again.  And it's funny.  Oh, he stays in it.  Yeah, but yeah, as I was watching, I was like, oh, he's not, I don't think he's doing 
[01:33:00]  that'd be funny.  I think he's just like in like the, the emotion of the scene and he doesn't want to jump out  of it and start laughing.  That doesn't sound hilarious.  Like fucking Burt Reynolds bloopers.  Cannonball run when Dom DeLuise is going.  The greatest.  Yeah.  The greatest.  Oh, look, he put his finger in a busboy's hiney.  Oh, look, he's sucking a young man's dick.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  He's grabbing his chest and he's fucking humped over in the fucking back of the semi. 
[01:33:30]  This is the greatest.  They just slap at each other in the face.  Turn that up a little bit.  That's the end of Hannibal Runs?  Yeah.  Okay.  We're good.  Wait a minute.  I got something.  No, this will help.  No, I'm not going to hit you.  No.  I'm not going to hit you.  I'm not going to hit you.  Listen to me.  I'm not going to hit you.  Watch, watch.  Oh. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm ready now.  Here we go.  He was smacking him in the face.  Look at this.  He gets right here.  He's like a laughing.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I spit a gun.  I'm ready.  We're off.  Where's he going to sit?  Where's he going to sit? 
[01:34:30]  I want you not to interfere in my affairs.  Steven, put that away.  Excuse me.  That's all right.  I'll have to do anything.  Yeah.  You see, even in the deepest...  Dude.  I know what we're doing.  What is this?  The fucking blooper hour?  Yeah.  What are we, fucking blooper city?  What are we, fucking blooper incorporated?  Blooper.com?  That fucking scene, when they're outside of the ambulance, and they have that crazy doctor  on the inside, and the cop goes, I rewind it over and over, where the cop goes, if you 
[01:35:00]  got to get her to the hospital so urgently, how come you're driving and not flying?  And Tom Telly goes, I don't know.  Which is to drive us?  Ask the doctor.  No.  But he has that realization of how crazy that fucking doctor is.  He's suffering from delirious germinimum.  Oh, and he says he's a proctologist, and he runs his finger under the guy's nose?  Yeah.  Ah, it's funny stuff.  Do you know when I had a laugh like that, when me and Bobby Kelly, we were doing Amy  Schumer's pilot, and we played the fucking creepy massage therapist, and it was the next 
[01:35:30]  to the last thing we were shooting, and Amy has to walk into the counter, and me and  Bob pop up from the sides as the creepy therapist, and we fucking couldn't get through it  without laughing.  Couldn't stop laughing.  Dude, it was one of those things where I'm like, I'm going to ruin this fucking show.  Because it gets to a point where I'm like, all right, I'm not enjoying this anymore.  I'm literally...  But you can't stop.  I couldn't look at her.  Yeah.  Every time we saw her, it was just, yeah, you can't stop. 
[01:36:00]  I was watching some of the fucking old Dean Martin roasts, seeing Dean Martin and Sammy  Davis Jr.  Don Rickles would come up and just say horrible things about black people, and it was on regular  television.  It was on just like fucking NBC would have it on, like, and tonight, the Dean Martin roasts,  and then he'd just get up there and say colored, and he turned to Nipsey Russell at one point,  because Nipsey Russell started saying something while he was, while Rickles was talking, and 
[01:36:30]  he goes, leave it to the spade to keep interrupting.  Jesus Christ.  It was regular television.  And then he goes, you call me spade one more time, I'll come over your house.  He goes, all I got to do is start tap dancing.  Like, they were just making more racist jokes.  Dude, he was on Letterman like three years ago with Denzel Washington, and Denzel Washington  wanted to stay out while Rickles was on. 
[01:37:00]  Rickles comes on, sits down, and he goes, what are you doing here?  Are you going to sweep up?  He just doesn't know or care.  And he, Rickles is one of the few made men who can literally say anything, and you can't  get angry at him because it's like, it's Rickles.  You can't, he's one of the few guys that is almost beyond criticism.  He kissed Sammy, and then he goes, did, he starts wiping his lip and goes, did any come  off?  Jesus Christ.  Like, it's just this old school.  Can you find Rickles on Letterman, Danny? 
[01:37:30]  Because I think there was one thing he did which was very funny.  So he was interacting with some black guy in the band.  It's from like 82 or 83.  Yeah, there's probably quite a few appearances of him on that.  Let me see.  I'll see.  Is it on Letterman?  Yeah, in the, uh, try part one of two right there.  That's old.  You think that might be him?  Yeah.  This is old school.  Oh my God, that is old.  Look at how fucking, I think he might be right, too.  How old he is.  Yeah, go back to that.  That's a black guy.  That might be it.  Oh boy.  I think it is.  Oh, a black guy. 
[01:38:00]  You don't have to, you don't have to play all things.  Right?  Turn it up.  Have a nice, uh, weekend.  Um, I had a lovely time here in the city.  The weather was swell, but I, I, uh, I'm very excited about having, uh, this next gentleman  on our program.  As I mentioned at the top of the show, he never fails to make me laugh.  He will be appearing at the Westbury Music Fair right here in New York beginning September  28th through October 2nd.  Damn.  Uh, truly one of the funniest men in the world.  Please welcome Don Rickles.  This has got to be, what, 85, baby?  Wow. 
[01:38:30]  Is there even a full band with, or is there?  Well, yeah, I guess, because it's the band.  Oh, fuck.  No music for him to come out to?  Yeah.  This is weird.  This is old school, man.  The chairs look like they got him from the cafeteria.  Yeah, this isn't Davis, the, the cutting edge guy.  No.  You look great.  We've got a real laid-back crowd here.  No, no.  They're all sitting there with grenades and guns.  They're happy to see you. 
[01:39:00]  We get a, we get a good group and, uh.  You should do.  And I, I've never been on your show.  I've been with you in, once in Los Angeles.  Right.  Johnny Carson when you were, you remember him?  Yeah.  Uh.  Oops.  Ed McMahon, who you're going to have on tomorrow night.  I'm here tomorrow, sure.  I just saw him today.  We had a drink together.  And he, he was, runs in front of Johnny's car and checks for grenades.  And that's, that's his whole life.  Johnny Carson.  Paul, have yourself committed.  That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said. 
[01:39:30]  Awfully nice guy, but there's a new thing out called food.  The black kid's sitting there going, what's he making fun of him for?  The black kid.  What's he making fun of him?  Don, that's, uh, that's, uh, Hiram Bullock.  Hiram Bullock?  Hiram Bullock, yeah, that's a black guy.  Hiram Bullock.  They give themselves those funny names so to stump the cops.  Jesus Christ.  That's your name, boy.  Hiram Bullock, now go. 
[01:40:00]  There.  Boy.  Jay's not laughing.  I kid you, Hiram.  You're black and I'm white.  That's the brakes.  Oh, my God.  Is he laughing?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's, it's one of the greatest lines ever.  Because he puts his arms up.  That's the brakes.  That's the brakes.  You're black and white.  Boy, you, uh, certainly, certainly can't get away with that, dude.  Jesus Christ.  Is there some guy going on Letterman now and doing that? 
[01:40:30]  I was just watching, I was just watching Pablo Francisco's new special last night,  and he does this whole thing in the middle of it where he's just like, he's like, he  just starts going, ah, yeah, man.  He's like, that's my black voice.  That's my project's voice.  And I was like, Jesus Christ.  Why was it totally out of context?  Dude, out of context?  He just starts doing, that's my, that's my black project scary voice.  Like, he, like, every time he tried to justify the voice, he put a worse word on it.  Like, uh, but I was just like, but I'm not comparing it to this.  I just was, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, who gives a shit?  It's a fucking stupid point that I made.  Sorry.  Thanks, Joe.  Now it's a good time for a break, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  We'll, uh, we'll, uh, come back.  Oh, maybe some jingles.  Yeah, we got jingles.  I know we got some of them jingles.  We got a jingle contest going on here.  Oh, look out.  And, uh, you know, it gives the, uh, audience an opportunity to send in some of the shit  that they make and, uh, show how, how talented we are because it really shows how untalented,  uh, everyone else is. 
[01:41:30]  But some of you can get $2,000 from IHateStevenSinger.com.  Call them, call them, how much?  Clams.  2,000 clams.  2,000 clams from, uh, Steven Singer?  2,000 schmackers.  That motherfucker really does come up with the cash for this, uh, program.  Smells a lot of diamonds.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  I think so.  I'm thinking some, uh, fucking, uh, secret, uh, shit.  Drug front.  Something like that.  Blood diamonds.  He might be selling.  Does he sell blood diamonds?  I don't think so.  I might sell drugs.  I don't think he sells blood diamonds.  The ones he smuggles with his anus are called blood diamonds. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, it's fucking banks, man.  I don't fucking, I don't support that diamond shit.  If I get engaged, I'm not buying a fucking diamond.  I'm not doing it.  That's Bill Burr.  Yeah, I'll get a ruby.  Ah, shit, it's good.  It's a cooler fucking color.  I'll get a ruby.  That's pretty good.  Ah, fucking, what a psychopath he is.  Yeah.  Love Bill.  You don't say.  Yeah.  Ah, really.  I will take a break.  Uh, Dr. Gay just came in with something. 
[01:42:30]  What do you got?  Jingles.  Oh, the jingles.  Oh, I know one.  Mr. Jingles.  Yeah.  Uh, yes.  Oh.  Jerry Shepard.  Oh, boy.  Jerry Shepard.  Thanks.  It ruined your day?  All day.  Good.  It'll tend to do that.  Uh, well.  These are by the titles?  Yeah.  It looks like we're going to have some fun ones today.  Give me an example of one title.  Uh, should I go with track seven, I guess?  Sal's a faggot.  Oh, right.  Wow.  I like the Sal of that one. 
[01:43:00]  The whole staff submitted a song.  All right.  Uh, be right there.  Back as they say.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O'Brien Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  Ooh.  We're back.  Hi.  How's everyone doing today?  I'm good.  Pleasant, I hope.  I was talking to the audience, Joe.  Oh, sorry.

[01:45:30]  I think they will.  People like the Joe DeRosa.  Thanks to you guys.  I think they like the Joe DeRosa.  So I want to get into some of the jingles that the audience has so lovingly put together  and sent to Dr. Gay.  Hey.  Oh, he's in here.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  You can get the jingles in at obianthony at seriousx.com.  Did I miss that Botox?  Or does he just put weight on because of his medicine?  Oh, yeah.  His cheeks look a little plump, don't they?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Big fat cowboy now. 
[01:46:00]  Actually, my voice is like this now.  I don't even sound like I'm his no more.  He's got those Nixon cheeks.  More Scotchianity.  Oh, boy.  No, no.  There's a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Why do you say there's a tree on my house?  It's I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a floor on my house.  Fucking cocksucker.  Thanks.  Thanks, Chip.  Wasn't good. 
[01:46:30]  Thanks, Chip.  Before we play the new jingles,  do you want to hear the one  that everybody seems to be so obsessed with?  Yes.  The one that everyone was raving about  over the weekend.  It was being tweeted.  Edgar.  It was being tweeted relentlessly.  Yeah.  Unbelievable, the anger people have for E-Rock.  Yeah, this one's kind of big.  It's not a jingle.  I don't want to call it a jingle contest.  They're fucking songs people are sending them, 
[01:47:00]  but this is one about E-Rock.  The Arby and Anthony show.  There's lots of laughs to be hiding.  I thought it was the other one. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I guess we were on different wavelengths.  Yep.  I thought you were going to play the fucking  E-Rock fucking.  I'll play the real one  that people are actually talking about.  Not yours, Edgar.  Shut up.  Feet up on the board like I run a show.  Pogie in my mouth, poogie in my mouth.  E-Rock, army nigga.  E-Rock, army nigga.  E-Rock, E-Rock.  Fat boy in his seat,  bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup. 
[01:48:00]  E-Rock, E-Rock army nigga.  It's great.  I love that one.  Hokey's in my mouth.  Bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  I love it.  E-Rock, you like that one, right?  I love that one.  Where's Sal today?  Sal's here.  Okay.  He's with fucking Manny.  Every time.  Every fucking time.  That makes me happy. 
[01:48:30]  God.  He's with Manny.  I've got enough of Platoon.  Is there one praising Sal?  There is one.  There's one about Sal.  There's a few that I think Jim will enjoy.  And then there's some ones that are specifically not good.  Ah.  Mix them up.  Okay.  All right.  Well, why don't we start with this?  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton too.  Ah, you know what?  Fuck this.  Oh.  That was Kevin's attempt.  Petered out right there. 
[01:49:00]  Simplicity never heard.  That would be okay if he sang it.  Mm-hmm.  If he sang it.  Yeah.  If it was very nice, well produced, and just gave up.  And took the language out and said, fudge this.  Exactly.  Because you've got nowhere to go.  That's it.  He starts down.  Where do you go?  You don't go down from down.  You go down from up.  Very good.  That's right.  This is comedy.  That's what I think too.  I agree.  Dr. Gay?  That's a take on superhero Jim.  Right.  Okay.  That makes sense now.  It didn't work.  No.  He didn't really put it across very well. 
[01:49:30]  No, he didn't know.  No.  No.  All right.  So let's see if we like this one a little bit better.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tetley Comedy Variety Hour.  Bill had been howling for hours and hours.  B-I-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  We all are going to have a really great time.  Why are you playing these so loud?  I know.  They're fucking blasting.  Because they're different levels. 
[01:50:00]  So the last one was loud.  What video game was that Super Mario World?  That's right.  That's right.  I thought I knew it.  That's Super Nintendo.  Oh, really?  That's absolutely Super Nintendo.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  It's supposed to be B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tetley.  Yeah.  He couldn't do that, though.  He didn't drag out the Y.  But it's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ride those levels.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  It's too loud.  I have to take the headphones halfway off my ears when he's doing that.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  What are we?  Regula commercials?  Wrong reference, guy.  You want another Bill Tetley? 
[01:50:30]  Uh, sure.  Why not?  Live from the 10 Sheckler Emporium in beautiful Branson, Missouri, it's the Bill Tetley Variety Hour!  Tonight's guest, children's entertainer Paul Hargis, comedian Lyle Chipperson, magician Jerry Houdini Sheppardini,  and the music of Sick F.N. Puppies.  And here's your host, B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley! 
[01:51:00]  Woo!  It's just the beginning of a talk show or something.  Sounds like a really good show, but...  Yeah, it does.  It does sound star-studded, too.  What dumb guests?  Like, who would invite Uncle Paul on as a talk show guest?  Yeah, what could he possibly have?  So, uh, you molest children.  No, I don't!  We'll be right back.  What dumb listener produces, like, the opening of a talk show for a jingle. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, that wasn't even a jingle at all.  He really broke the production budget on that one, too.  What the fuck was he?  Recorded a phone.  He had a boombox.  Joe, you think that's bad.  Oh, really?  There's some bad ones?  Really?  Let's see if I'm...  I have a folder on my computer.  Not good.  It's about 200 entries.  Wow.  I love it.  This is one of the not good entries.  That last one we heard didn't qualify as not good.  This does.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:52:00]  We know.  He rocks fat.  He has more chins than Chinatown.  He likes to look at bikini pics while he's at work.  He should die in a hole.  But he would not fit because he's so fat.  We all know.  You rock on me, nigga. 
[01:52:30]  That one was amazing.  The writing was not bad on that one.  That's pretty good.  He should die in a hole, but he wouldn't fit because he's so fat.  That's just mean-spirited.  Yeah, you're right.  Take it back.  I didn't like that.  Poor Chubbsy.  Let's get one with a little more music.  Okay, this one should pep us up a little bit.  All right.  Hopefully.  I like the radio.  Yes, indeed I do.  I like Goffi and Anthony. 
[01:53:00]  How about you?  Oh, wow.  That's a little more peppy.  That was good.  When did I say that?  That was when you were trying your jingle out that you had thought of.  And he grabbed it and fucking used it.  It works.  Damn, he's ripping you off.  Hoo-hoo.  Yeah.  I'm going to do another bad one.  Please.  Okay.  Love the bad ones.  This is a not good one.  Oh, come on.  Now, Travis, how did you convert that from one of those little old answering machine tapes? 
[01:53:30]  Oh, see, that's the thing I didn't. 
[01:54:00]  That sounded like it was literally recorded when that song was popular.  He was trying for a suck my fucking cock.  Yeah, that's one thing that you'll notice.  Probably not because I don't bring a lot of them in.  A lot of people want to reference the same things that Coke Float guy did with Eric.  Yeah.  And a lot of guys want to try and create the next suck my fucking cock.  Can't do it.  It just doesn't work.  That's a one in a million shot right there. 
[01:54:30]  We should have that one cleaned up, though.  Oh, really?  You don't like it?  No need for the dirty talk.  Grandma Jim.  Yeah.  Auntie Jim.  Yeah.  Do you still do Valley Girl, Jim?  Oh, God.  Thanks.  Why would you ask?  I haven't in a while.  We haven't heard it.  Wow.  Oh, man.  God.  Why would you bring it up?  These are so gruddy, these songs.  Oh.  I'd love doing Valley Girl, Jim. 
[01:55:00]  Thanks.  Everybody loves it.  No, nobody.  Thanks a lot there.  It's annoying.  It's not even timely.  It doesn't make any sense on any level.  I like it.  All right.  This one is Untitled by David.  Let's give it a title, then.  Fuck.  No.  Ah, shit.  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Opie and Anthony Jingle. 
[01:55:30]  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Holy shit.  Opie and Anthony Jingle.  Oh, God.  I like it on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh.  He ruined it at the end.  That's what ruined it?  Yeah.  Did you notice the ironic self-reflexivity of the whole thing?  I noticed that.  It was terrible.  I kind of felt like he picked it up at the end.  I felt like when he went, oh, Satellite Radio, I felt like I was like, oh, that actually, 
[01:56:00]  I think could actually work as a little...  No.  No?  All right.  It's terrible.  I never want to hear it again.  He's a loser.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here is one sent in by Ryan.  Ryan.  Did you get turned on when you heard Frankus?  You turned me on.  Yeah.  Frankus.  Ew.  Did you get turned on when you heard Frankus?  My sexiest panties.  My package was perfect. 
[01:56:30]  Ooh.  Fill it up a little bit.  That's nice.  Yeah, look at the LB's package.  Did you get turned on when you heard Frankus?  Ew.  Why am I leaking clear stuff?  Where did the yucky glue come from?  This is the gayest thing I've ever allowed someone to do to me.  Oh.  It was more a production piece, but that's fine.  It's lacking direction a little bit.  Yeah, I don't disagree, Sam.  It lacks direction.  If an intern turned that in, we might be like, oh, look, he's trying.  Right.  Say, all right.  Yeah, if Sal turned it in, it would be like an amazing piece of production. 
[01:57:00]  If Sal turned it in?  Because Sal is so bad.  Well, you remember how bad Sal's production piece was, right?  It was the worst.  Did he ever do a production piece?  He did a thing about, I think it was Roland?  Oh, something about Roland getting mad.  Don't get the panda angry!  Terrible.  That still makes me sick.  I cringe.  It's humiliating. 
[01:57:30]  I'm not even joking.  No.  It's so bad.  His try at sounding mad and like...  It's a lion at the end of the piece.  It's a lion at the end of the piece.  But him trying to have a booming voice in that, and it's just thinness and shit.  It gives me the same feeling I get when I hear like a 40-year-old white woman be like,  Oh, you go, girlfriend.  It gives you the savings.  The urge to rape. 
[01:58:00]  Reminds me of Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf.  Where he's like, Give me a keg of beer.  Does anybody remember that movie at all?  No.  But that's actually intimidating.  He gets the keg of beer.  He sure does.  He does.  Sal thought he was going to be one of those production behind the scenes, but he uses  his own voice, so he has a little in front of the camera stuff, too.  He thought me and Opie were going to be fighting who gets that on our soundboards.  Right, right.  He thought it was like, No, I get that. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, come on, man.  When Roland gets mad, I want to hit that.  He was thinking, Don't get the panda angry!  I like the growl at the end.  Watch, watch.  Make it a little longer.  Yeah.  He's thinking a lot of production guys, like they have to find voiceover people to fill  in their vision.  Yeah.  But he's the total package.  He's the guy.  He can handle that.  I like the explosion.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, that's great.  And then the panda becomes a lion.  Yeah.  Don't get the panda angry!  Don't get the panda angry!  Oh, God.  Fuck yourself.  Joe!  Joe can't take it.  You hate it, right, Joe?  The production piece?  It makes me fucking sick.  Maybe the explosion turns the panda into a lion.  That's just silly. 
[01:59:30]  That's the face.  That's the face you make during the production piece.  That that old guy is making.  Oh, oh.  Go back.  Let's hear it.  Give me a keg of beer.  Yeah, but the people who made that movie at least...  He's like, I can't believe you turned that into a radio show.  And he runs away terrified.  You know what Sal's production piece should have been?  What?  I'm a pepeed-haired cunt.  Pepeed-haired cunt.  I'm a pepeed-haired cunt. 
[02:00:00]  See, I've learned not to laugh over things like that, so they'll be isolated well for later.  I mean...  Oh, shit.  I saw your hand writing that down.  While we're talking about Sal, one of the listeners also created a production piece.  If we wanted to do...  Should we take a listen?  I hope it's not negative.  Please.  I haven't heard it, so I'm assuming it's positive.  Right? 
[02:00:30]  Sal's a faggot, choking a dick.  Sal's a faggot, opening up the radio show.  Did you guys hear that?  Excellent.  Oh, my God.  You liked it, Jim.  That was awesome.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Should I play it?  You should.  Play it one more time in case you guys...  Because Danny laughed a little bit.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Sal's a faggot, choking a dick. 
[02:01:00]  Sal's a faggot, opening up the radio show.  Oh, I'm Jim.  And Jim.  You got the names of Sal's a faggot.  You guys can choke on a dick.  How come people can't find good ways to record their voice?  Can you hear the music?  Like, whatever he's doing in the background.  It sounded like the TV was on.  Yeah.  I didn't even hear it.  I just thought I just heard him.  It sounded like he left the TV on.  Yeah, no.  There was, like, a little music playing in the background.  He's singing to.  Yeah.  I mean, how many millions of iPhones have been sold, right?  Yeah.  My iPhone records pretty okay. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  That sounds like a kid who's trying for his parents not to hear him.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, he's really, like, swallowing the song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's it.  I really want to record this Sal's a faggot song, but Mom's in the other room.  Yeah, exactly.  When they cry into your nipple.  Sam, maybe if you can play it again, maybe we can try and figure out what song's playing in the background.  Oh, that's a great call, Travis.  Let me just, like, pump up the volume a little bit. 
[02:02:00]  Sal's a faggot choking a dick.  Sal's a faggot opening up in the radio show.  I'm going to guess Terrence Trent Darby.  Ah, yeah.  E-Rock, do you like that jingle?  That's better than E-Rock Army, nigga.  You love it.  Come on, man.  That one's great.  Sal, did Sal like it?  Yeah, where's, I don't know.  Where is he?  I guess he's in the back.  Aw.  What's he doing?  He's on the phones.  Touch it in the back.  What's he doing besides ignoring your orders? 
[02:02:30]  Fucking, you rule with a velvet fist, asshole.  We know he's not making good production.  Yeah, exactly.  Here he is, sauntering up the hall.  Take your time, Sal.  Exactly.  The beat, you rule with a velvet fist was hilarious, and then just to pause, asshole.  Just to push it over the top, mean.  Sal, were you imagining with Don't Get the Panda Angry that me and Opie were going to be 
[02:03:00]  fighting over who gets it on our soundboard?  I was listening in the back.  Were you fantasizing about, like, this is going to be a good one?  Here's a question.  It was horrible.  Did the explosion wake up the line who was sleeping next to the panda?  That's why he was so angry.  Right.  Is that what happened?  Yeah, it happened in a zoo.  That's what happened.  Now, Sal, you have not heard the jingle that was just...  I heard it the four times you just played it.  Since he hasn't heard it, right.  Let's give it a listen since you haven't heard it just yet.  Make sure you got headphones on. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, Sal needs headphones.  We're going to have to play it again.  Sal's a baggy.  Choking a dick, Sal's a baggy.  I can't have a radio show.  And Jim.  And Jim.  I like that.  And Jim at the end is really good.  And Jim.  Thoughts, questions, comments?  I'm flattered that someone actually take the time to put something together about me.  It was so accurate.  It was awful.  It was so accurate.  Sal, how does it make you feel that this half-assed, fucking five-second effort of 
[02:04:00]  a jingle has brought more joy to this radio show than the thing you took hours to make?  No, clearly it didn't take me hours to put that horse shit in.  Oh, come on.  That's a lie.  Don't try to play it.  No, really.  Don't insult it.  How long did it take you?  It probably took me 15 minutes.  Bullshit.  That thing is slickly produced.  I'll tell you that.  It's very well produced.  You're saying it's slickly produced two minutes ago.  You're saying how awful it is.  No.  Terrible.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's crying out over here.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  No, Sal.  It's not funny.  It's not funny at all.  But it's very well produced, though.  There's a difference.  Look, fucking, you know, Shania Twain records are well produced.  They stink.  Right.  But they're well produced.  You know what I mean?  So you're saying I'm a good producer, then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're the first to say that.  Just not a good writer, is it?  No, I don't disagree.  I mean, you might be a good writer.  I don't know.  A panda voice live.  Oh, a panda voice.  No, could you do that live?  Maybe it will sound better in person.  You're right, Jim.  No, I'm not doing that.  Come on. 
[02:05:00]  He gets in on here.  Come on.  He said do it.  All right.  All right.  Just get in the zone.  You're in your production studio, you know, when none of us are here.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, I just had a brilliant idea for the show.  You thought it was good when you did it.  Much like a breathalyzer.  Don't do it wrong the first time or just make you do it again.  Fucking Sam Coppola over there.  Here's what we're looking for.  So think about it.  Not like we haven't heard it yet.  Go back to that place.  Yeah.  You're killing me, Jim.  Roland just got angry. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, do it.  And so you're like, oh, wait till I hear this.  I can finally add something.  And here's what it sounds like.  I'm not doing it.  Do it.  Do it.  This is awful.  So you've got to do it.  Let's do it.  And it sounds a little like this.  Go.  Don't get the panda.  No, no, no, no.  That's the same emotion.  Wait, wait.  You know what the problem is?  It sounded a little like it.  I got to hear it again.  He doesn't remember.  Sam, I already saw you going with the fucking joke.  He doesn't remember.  Don't get the panda angry. 
[02:06:00]  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Wait for the line.  Wait for the line.  Yeah.  Give it 45 minutes.  Go to lunch and come back when the line stops roaring.  Sal, which of those voices was your real voice?  The deep one or the high one?  Yeah.  I pitched them down.  See, you're a good producer.  You know what?  You're speaking the lingo over here.  The lingo.  You pitched it down.  You're great.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go, Sal.  Come on.  Go ahead.  Let her rip. 
[02:06:30]  Let's hear it.  Don't get the panda angry.  There you go.  You happy now?  Look, look.  It's awful.  I fucking hate myself for being here.  You like that?  My dick just went up inside my body.  Why did you point your arm?  Because the hair came up on my arm.  I got like.  You didn't like it?  Like goose bump chill, like bad way.  Can we hear that?  Can we hear that?  The live version that we just heard?  The reviews are already coming in for the live version.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Sounds of baggage.  Choking the dick.  Sounds of baggage.  Open asking radio show.  All right.  So we'll call them mixed right now.  Mixed reviews.  Mixed reviews.  Yeah.  That was good, Sal.  It was pretty good.  Thanks, Sal.  Come on.  You did it.  I did it.  I played along with it.  See?  I want to hear the new version.  E-Rod, do you have that?  Here we go.  Here's the new version.  Joke on a dick.  Oh.  Don't get the panda angry. 
[02:07:30]  It's awful.  Can you add this?  Let's do it all live.  Let's do it.  Okay.  Play that.  But who's going to be the explosion?  Can I be the explosion?  All right.  Jimmy's the explosion.  You be the lion, and I'll be the growl lion at the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Two part.  I got you.  I got you.  Okay.  You'll taper off, and I'll take over.  All right.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:08:00]  Don't.  Oh, wait.  Somebody's got to be secondary Sal voice, too.  The high one?  Somebody's got to do the low one.  Maybe I'll do low Sal.  Wait.  Sal should pitch himself down.  Yeah.  We have his audio normal.  You're right here.  Sal can pitch.  So you could do it your own voice.  Add a little bass to it.  Double it.  Double it.  All right.  A little bass, though.  A little bass.  This is called on the fly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  All right.  What are you playing it for?  Well, he's got to play that. 
[02:08:30]  He's doubling his vocal.  Just to double it.  But E-Rock, you've got to count us off.  This is killing me.  Yeah.  Maybe like this is killing me.  E-Rock would be the worst guy in a band ever if you just start playing.  Wait, wait.  There needs to be a cue.  I don't like him doubling it.  I like it without the stuff in the back.  Yeah, thank you.  It's awful.  It's a bad idea.  I don't like him doubling it.  Okay.  You just do it live.  Do it live.  Do the real verse live.  Don't you play it, E-Rock.  Okay.  Let him just do it live. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  You're the explosion, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You're the lion.  I'll be the tapering growl.  Okay.  All right.  I'll be the tapering growl.  All right.  Don't get the panda angry.  So long.  That was great.  That was perfect.  I think that was it.  That was really good. 
[02:09:30]  We nailed it.  Yeah.  That was really good.  Sal, you stink.  I know.  That was terrible.  That's more production than the talents done in five years.  Sal, the baggy, choking a dick.  Sal, the five years.  The radio show.  Oh, shit.  Sam, give me a hard time?  I mean, I think what you said about making me do it live is more embarrassing than that.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Got it.  Can we hear it? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, let's hear what it sounded like now that we're going to.  Let's listen.  See if we nailed it.  Because maybe the live version is better than the studio version.  Yeah, maybe it's just, you know.  You never know.  Right, right.  You're a comment.  What are you doing?  Nice.  Wiping mayonnaise off his fingers.  Oh.  His lips.  Licking his finger.  Licking his finger.  Greasy palms.  He's fucking, what a terrible criminal he'd be.  They'd find his fingerprints on water. 
[02:10:30]  Greasy fingers.  Just this rainbow-y fucking fingerprint.  Floating.  The grease.  There's fudge all over the vault.  Over the vault door.  Yes.  Salt and vinegar everywhere.  Someone was munchy launching fucking salt and vinegar chips as they tried to pick this lock.  What's that?  He loves salt and vinegar chips.  What's that?  Do you like them, Iraq?  He loves them.  Oh, yeah.  They are good.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the bank would have to put that ink thing in the bills. 
[02:11:00]  Just look for bills that have Dorito cheese all over them.  That's you, snack boy.  You got it, Iraq?  Yep.  All right.  Let's hear our production piece.  Don't get the panda angry!  That's such a good purr.  That's really good.  It's better than the original. 
[02:11:30]  I just don't like Sal laughing at it, though.  Yeah.  Maybe we need to do it again.  Do you think we should do it one more time?  Yeah, I think so.  You can't laugh, Sal.  No laughing.  No laughing.  This one's going to be the keeper.  That was the dry run-up.  This is the one that's going to get on Ope's replay.  Well, unless Anthony gets it first.  I'm going to fight for it.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  Every time Roland comes in, it'll be just a laugh waiting to happen.  Thanks to Sally.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Sal.  All right.  Don't get the panda angry! 
[02:12:00]  Don't get the panda angry!  Please, can we hear that? 
[02:12:30]  In my ears, that sounded like it could be the one.  Yeah, that sounded like the one.  The roar was a little short at the end, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can improve on that, other than that.  Come on.  That's fucking great.  That was awesome.  Iraq, what is the whole thing Iraq's got to go through to get the clip?  Come on, you bum.  Is it like...  No.  It's on a delay, so it just takes a little bit.  Oh.  It's already.  Oh!  Here we go.  Don't get the panda angry! 
[02:13:00]  Oh, shit, dude.  Perfect.  That was good.  That's perfect.  Nailed it that time.  And I feel like the live growl sounds slightly like there's a feasible possibility that it 
[02:13:30]  could be a panda, as opposed to...  That's true!  Yeah.  Yeah.  The original production.  You know, like Sal's...  Get the panda angry!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  I'm sure we did.  There's plenty of other...  I guess there's other Sal jingles that are coming in, too. 
[02:14:00]  Are there any more, Dr. Gay?  Yeah.  I felt that was the best one, but I mean, look...  That is a good one.  I'm not the talent, so if you guys want me to burn them onto a CD and you want to listen  to them, that's up to you.  We should always have them available, anyway.  Yeah.  That's a good point, Ant.  I mean, I can't disagree there.  And it's really not fair to the listeners to not let their voices be heard.  Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, they did put a lot of time and effort into these.  Especially this guy.  Let me just take my headphones off and maybe I'll just bring you a new CD.  No one's so sad.  Come on.  I'm not sad.  This is fun.  A couple more Sal ones.  All right.  All right.  It's a good time.  That was good. 
[02:14:30]  Any more jingles that we want to get to today?  There is...  Good competition.  $2,000 from Steven Singer Jewelers for the winner, which will be chosen through no criteria  whatsoever by who?  Us, I guess.  Us?  Uses?  Yeah.  And you can email the entries to opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yeah.  Obviously, there's still a lot of room to find a winner.  So, keep them entries coming.  Real quick.  Yeah.  You said you have one more?  Yeah.  After that, Jim was out on Friday.  I don't know if there's any from Friday that we might want to play for Jim. 
[02:15:00]  Just three.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh!  Look at you guys.  Are you on the same page?  Oh, totally.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're on the same page?  Yeah.  I'm on the page 200.  Good one, Chip.  Goddamn, that was funny.  I know.  Yeah, there's two, actually, from Friday.  From Friday?  That we'll play it.  I don't remember.  Friday's your favorite day of the week, right, Valley Girl?  Oh, my God.  I like the weekend.  Jesus, Joe. 
[02:15:30]  Jesus, Joe.  Friday's party night, right?  Sure is.  Gotta go out and get some drinks.  My friends.  Matter of fact, let's do Fridays first.  Yeah.  Friday.  Friday.  All right.  Oof.  Oof.  You don't like Valley Jim?  No.  Oh, I hate Valley Jim.  This is another E-Rock jingle.  Oh, right.  But we didn't get the reference to why the music was playing in it until, like, on the 
[02:16:00]  after show or something.  Is this the Christmas one?  No.  Piggy boy, piggy boy, piggy boy rock.  I don't think that's the one, no.  Sorry.  So see if you can figure out, Jim, why this music is playing.  All right.  Eric is a dummy.  Stole some pictures from O.D.  He has a child's mentality. 
[02:16:30]  Can't go an hour without E.T.  Some think he rock his brain less.  I say retarded at best.  Now go to break, you dirty hooped fat fuck.  Go to break so he can have his fifth lunch. 
[02:17:00]  So what?  Have his fifth lunch, I think.  So he can have his fifth lunch.  E-Rock, you should do a reboot of MASH called Mashed Potatoes.  Oh.  No.  No.  4077 pounds.  Obviously, that was...  Did we do this break already, E-Rock?  No.  No.  That's right.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's why.  Of course.  Jimmy would always interrupt him with the MASH music.  E-Rock sitcom would take place during the Korean buffet. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, and he'd eat a bunch of fucking dogs or something.  Fucking puke them out of the shit of them.  Oh, boy.  That's a little extreme, Chip.  God, Chip.  This was the other one that we forgot about it, but this was the only one.  E-Rock Army and this one are, I think, the two runaway favorites.  Yeah.  So this one is called Radio Wizard.  Oh, right.  Yeah, this was a big one.  Ever since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bald. 
[02:18:00]  His venison stinks, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him a question's like talking to a wall.  That egg-headed dummy doesn't like the show at all.  He's the radio wizard but doesn't know shit. 
[02:18:30]  The radio wizard is such a stupid twit.  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would.  So it's Radio Wizard.  I like Radio Wizard.  That was funny.  Radio Wizard is a good one.  Now, the last one for today is a new one.  Ooh.  It's brand new.  Excuse me. 
[02:19:00]  It's in the not good section.  Yeah.  And it is significantly longer than any of the generals we played today.  Did someone decide to go the whole limit?  Yeah.  The 90-second fucking...  Oh, no.  Come on.  This one clocks in at 56 seconds.  Why?  Why?  So, uh...  But, Travis, you know, I mean, we enjoyed the, uh...  E-Rock is fat that was in the not good section.  So maybe he's wrong.  Maybe this is indeed good.  Okay.  It was sent in by Keith.  It's called Behind the Scenes.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW so you can talk to E-Rock, the overweight cow. 
[02:19:30]  Play What Did You Learn to Tell What You Know by asking for Sam on the after show.  He's usually hanging with Roland and Quan.  One of them mumbles.  The other's Don Juan.  Then there's Danny.  He's pretty fucking funny.  Acts like Ant but without the money.  And Travis, too.  I don't know much about him.  What the fuck does he do?  Ask poor Mars if you need engineer advice. 
[02:20:00]  No matter what he'll charge you, he'll say,  That's a good place!  And in turn, Sal, what can I say?  He lies a lot and pretends he's not gay.  Let's not forget about Club Soda Kenny.  He's more than just a limo driver.  He counts every penny.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW so you can talk behind the scenes right fucking now.  I was crazed, everybody.  Thank you.  That was one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life. 
[02:20:30]  That was terrible.  Horrid.  I never want to hear that again.  That is terrible.  I think we're going to play a bunch of times on the after show.  What's his name?  He should be exposed.  His name is Keith Leckie.  That's actually good.  That's like when someone tells your mom to write a rap song.  That's the kind of cadence it would follow.  And then there's Danny.  I'm your mom and I'm here to say.  Oh my God.  That was so bad.  Really, really, really bad.  Wow. 
[02:21:00]  People are going to have to cleanse that off their palate.  That really sucks.  Yeah.  I like that one.  You did, Jim?  Yep.  I didn't like, too, that he only insulted E-Rock.  Everybody else got off pretty easy in that.  You listened closely enough?  I listened to all the lyrics.  Yeah.  Terrible.  I didn't like that E-Rock was the only one that caught a fucking insult and everybody else  got off.  I think that stinks.  Why don't we cleanse the palate with some Sal jingles?  Some Sal jingles that have just been run in. 
[02:21:30]  And that will hopefully bring down your angst about only E-Rock getting shots taken at him.  Why?  Oh, because these are Sal insulters.  I thought you meant these were things Sal made.  No, no, no, no.  These are both by the same guy.  Which would be potentially more insulting to his character than jingles about him.  Well, these were both made by Scott.  Both of them.  So he really...  These were both made by Scott.  Yeah.  The first one is called Salamander, the Hipster. 
[02:22:00]  Salamander, the hipster queer.  No one knows what he's doing here.  He don't do his job, but that's a fact.  He only picks on E-Rock.  I think that was great.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, it had a nice beat.  A little salamander sound.  That sucked.  Okay.  I liked it.  You liked it, Joe.  I thought it was pretty grody.  I don't even know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.  Like a Bobby McFerrin thing going on.  Grody's bad.  Yeah, Bobby McFerrin.  Not insulting enough to Salamander. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, it should be Bobby Mc...  Okay.  I fucking...  Joe, why did you fucking even mention that?  Jimmy hasn't done that in so long.  For exactly this reason.  Everyone's got their Jimmy characters that they can't stand or their girlfriends hate or something.  That fucking Valley Gym, I hate it.  I'm not just saying this.  I know you hate...  It's really my favorite character.  I love it.  That's right.  It makes me laugh really hard.  No.  And then the fact that it disgusts you is just a bonus. 
[02:23:00]  Why don't you go to clue school and get one?  There's no such thing as clue school.  It's terrible.  It's just...  And the voice, like, makes me cringe.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Why don't you put on a winter coat or something?  What the fuck?  You're shivering.  None of Jim's wit is given to any of Jim's characters.  No, no.  Jimmy keeps that wit that he has away from all the characters. 
[02:23:30]  He's selfish with it.  I don't think he wants...  He doesn't want the characters to kill too hard.  Yeah.  I don't kill anything.  I don't eat meat.  Oh.  What the hell?  You eat meat.  Do you want to hear the last jingle of the day?  I'd rather not.  What do you want to do, Valley Jim?  It's like getting hit in the ears or something.  This one is called Sal the Pussy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Sal's a faggot.  Going on with the animal theme, I guess.  Right.  Okay.  The only pussy in Williamsburg is Sal. 
[02:24:00]  Don't make the hands up angry.  Just don't do it.  Just stop.  That's great.  That's pretty funny.  That was a good one. 
[02:24:30]  And then Gay Sal's voice going, just stop it.  That was good.  I just applaud him for being able to make something and hand it in and have it sound like okay.  Like the recording was okay.  I was able to understand what you were saying.  Yeah, exactly.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  I think E-Rock Army and Radio Wizard are still in the top two.  Yeah, those are hits.  Yeah, I hadn't heard that.  I was off.  I was out last week.  But that E-Rock Army.  How is that not going to win the whole thing?  I don't know. 
[02:25:00]  It's really good.  Oh, and Sal's a faggot.  That's not in the top five.  That's got to be in the top three, right?  No?  It'd be in my book.  I want to hear Coke floats in my cup again.  We just play these over and over again.  Yeah, but we got a new audience like every 15 minutes.  We played that at least 25 minutes ago.  Big turnover.  Feet up on the floor like I run the show.  Hoagies in my mouth.  Hoagies in my mouth.  E-Rock Army niggas. 
[02:25:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock Army niggas.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Fat boy in the seat.  Bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  I like it because you know what?  He knows to just cut it like quick.  It's a jingle.  It needs to be quick and catchy.  It's not something that you need the whole 90 second time limit for.  Yeah.  Get in, get out, make everyone laugh.  Yeah, he could have gone a second verse or something, but he chose not to.  No.  Glad.  Oh, no. 
[02:26:00]  One of my favorite parts of that is that he does the whole, like, second line in one breath.  He doesn't breathe before he says it, Jim.  He squeezes it in on the same breath.  Yeah.  That's impressive.  Also, that his snap is 50 decibels louder than anything else in the song.  Oh, he's terrible.  That was entertaining. 
[02:26:30]  Another batch that came in, like I said, $2,000 first prize from Steven Singer Jewelers.  What's that email address?  Obi Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  You know what's funny?  I like how we have to have, like, a category, a column for good and a column for bad.  Yeah.  Because I remember, like, when this kind of thing would happen back in the day and you'd air them  and then people would get upset and be like, well, how come that one's good?  Mine's better than that.  Yeah, yeah.  They get all fucking nasty about it.  And then you had to have, like, a winners and losers bracket.  It's like, okay, well, here's the ones that are good, that are good, and here's the one  that are good because they suck. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  That they're good.  Yes.  But there are.  There are bad and good ones.  But now everybody's happy because now no one complains.  Yeah.  That's great.  What the hell is that?  Oh, it looked like Colin.  Colin with cancer.  Yeah.  Get up this morning.  Yeah, well.  Fox News.  What are you going to do?  I have to tinkle.  Yeah, let's take a break, and we'll be back with more shenanigans and hijinks.  Don't get the panda angry! 
[02:27:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Whatever.  Whatever.  We were discussing certain things during the break. 
[02:28:00]  It was kind of interesting.  Oh, sure.  I won't say freakish or anything or sick or anything.  I would.  Joe DeRosa is looking for a certain type of girl, I guess.  I like older women.  But it's not a...  You know, we've talked about it a lot on here.  But I like...  Everybody's going up at me.  No, no, no.  How old are you?  35.  All right.  An older woman for you would be...  50.  A 38, 40-year-old woman is an older woman than you.  Technically older.  That's not... 
[02:28:30]  You know what I mean.  That's not a...  That's horrible.  I want to have sex.  You're disgusted, Jim.  I fucking can't comprehend it.  How old of a woman...  Now, you're completely...  You can't come without white shoes up in the air?  Sorry.  How old of a woman is like...  If you could fantasize about any age woman,  how old of a woman would you be looking for?  55, 60.  55 or 60-year-old woman, you want to...  But like a hot 55...  I wouldn't even be friends with one of them. 
[02:29:00]  I loved your show.  Really?  Fuck you.  But in this day and age,  55, 60 is a very different story  from what it was 10 years ago.  Yes.  10 years older.  Yeah, exactly.  They were fucking 45, 50.  Now they're 55, 60.  Gross to grosser.  Now, what is it?  What is it about that?  What attracts you to a woman of that age?  I don't know.  I just like older women.  I've always...  Ever since I was a very young kid,  I always did the teacher fantasy, 
[02:29:30]  all that stuff.  That's fine, but...  Something went on.  Just to suck their big, smelly lamp...  Oh, yuck.  A lot of them have fake tits.  What?  A lot of them have fake tits,  so their tits are...  Yeah, because the real ones have been...  You're telling me...  You're telling me...  Yeah, yeah.  You're telling me right now,  you wouldn't fuck Raquel Welch or somebody like...  You wouldn't fuck her?  She's 70.  No.  I might just...  She's 70.  You wouldn't have fucked her at 60.  She was smoking.  Again, because...  No.  But she's a one in a million rarity. 
[02:30:00]  But that's...  I'm saying that kind of vibe.  I'm not saying I want to fuck some goddamn...  You know...  If I could...  If I was good with references or riffing,  I could think of something right now.  After Rula Lenska?  Ah, Rula Lenska.  Yeah, I'm not saying I want to fuck Bea Arthur.  You know what I mean?  Like, you know, or like that.  I'm saying, like, I want to fuck, like,  a sexy older woman.  It turns me on.  You know, for me, an older woman...  If she's pushing 30, I'm like,  you'll be lucky if I stick this in you. 
[02:30:30]  Fucking 55.  I wouldn't even give them a ride home.  I get younger sometimes, but I can't...  They annoy the fuck out of me after a while,  and I can't do it.  You know what I want?  A young chick, like 25...  Between 25 and 30,  with a fucking giant meat pussy.  That's all I want.  A fucking...  Like, the type of...  What about Charo?  Mr. Charo.  Would you fuck Charo?  Coochie Coochie Coochie Coochie?  No, I never...  I don't think Charo was hot  even when she was young.  She never did it for me.  I fuck her dead body.  She's dead?  You like Charo?  She's not dead.  No, she's not dead,  but I don't know. 
[02:31:00]  There's something sexy about her.  No, I wouldn't.  As old as she even is now,  there's something sexy about her.  How about Zha Zha?  Would you lift her remaining leg  and stick it in her?  I don't know why.  I don't know what it is.  No, you know there's no firmness,  there's no elasticity  or firmness in that body.  But these days,  that's not true anymore.  No, it is.  It's basic chemistry.  That's not true anymore.  Talking the moisture  is fucking leaving their body  like the salt-sucking monster  on Star Trek.  Look up fucking...  Of course,  I'm drawing a goddamn blank right now, 
[02:31:30]  but dude,  that chick that hosts this show  that's always on?  Which one?  The morning news show,  that blonde,  morning coffee,  the short head one?  Oh, you like that fucking...  On Morning Joe?  Yeah, or Morning Joe.  That fucking dick in the mud,  Tweety Bird bitch.  I'm not saying she sounds like  a lot of fun to hang out with,  but I'm saying she turns me on.  She's probably a good fuck,  because she's such an uptight cunt  that she is probably a fuck.  She probably can't get enough  dick in her ass.  Mika.  Yeah, she stinks.  No, I'd bang her.  Other people like her.  The second search is Mika, 
[02:32:00]  whatever her last name is,  Legs.  Legs.  Yeah, she's fuckable.  Bikini hot feet.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  Jesus.  What a fucking bore  she is on TV.  Totally.  Who's like an older...  Goldie Hawn?  I'd fuck Susan Sarandon.  Oh, God.  Absolutely.  Yuck.  Oh, God.  Absolutely.  She stinks.  Old golf ball-eyed  Susan Sarandon.  You'd fucking bang her now?  You'd bang her now?  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  I...  Yes, why is that so...  You know what?  Even if you're not into it,  why are you so offended by that?  Why does that bother you so much?  Do I pass judgment on you  and the way you conduct...  Yes, every day.  I'd rather fuck Chris Sarandon.  You got a good point.  Look at her.  Oh, I'd love to.  Oh, my God.  That's a grandma looking...  Let me see her face.  I think she's hot.  I don't care.  She's fucking horrible.  She's not hot.  She looks like Robert Plant.  The big fucking fat, round face, 
[02:33:00]  that wispy, curly, shitty hair.  She really does.  What about...  Oh, boy.  You're just...  Slums get hotter as they older.  Yeah, but I forgot to specify female,  so I'm getting pictures of Tom Cruise.  15 hot celebrities with even hotter moms.  I would have banged Goldie Hawn circa  the fucking Baxter girl.  What was that movie they did  where they were the banger sisters?  Oh, that?  I would have banged her in that movie.  Would you have eaten her ass  after Private Benjamin  where it seems like old times?  I would have.  Who else do you want to fuck?  Donald Pleasance? 
[02:33:30]  It's terrible.  Oh, Helen Mirren in two seconds.  Helen Mirren's too old, but she's...  Look at that.  You wouldn't fuck her, Jim?  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Helen Mirren is a rare case, maybe,  but there's no way that feels  as good as it looks.  Demi Moore.  Yeah, Demi Moore, yes.  Demi Moore's 50.  You wouldn't fuck her?  Yeah, but she's Hollywood 50, man.  That's a lot of work, 50.  But what I'm saying is  the average woman now  can be almost Hollywood 50.  No, because you're going to end up 
[02:34:00]  with a 55-year-old disaster.  You're talking about all this,  but when you bed that 55-year-old woman,  it ain't going to be Helen Mirren.  It ain't going to be Demi Moore.  It's going to be some fucking old bat  that you find in some gin mill.  You really just like to take a guy's dreams  down to the fucking ground, don't you?  I'm sorry, Helen.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Let me see.  Who's that?  I love her, at least from the small picture.  Oh, no.  Click on it.  Who is that?  It looks like, what's her name  from the shit yogurt commercial?  Jamie Lee Curtis. 
[02:34:30]  I'd still fuck Jamie Lee Curtis.  Only because she has a big, meaty pussy.  I've always thought that about her.  I wouldn't have sex with her now  because she crossed over,  and she looks...  Yeah, yeah, she looks...  She looks, like, lesbian-ish.  Yes, with the short hair.  Because the short gray hair.  Short gray hair.  Yeah, she kind of went  the Kelly McGillis route.  Oh, Kelly McGillis, a disaster.  Jamie Lee looks better than Kelly McGillis,  but she went that same route of, like,  I'm just going to turn in  the sexy card completely.  I give up. 
[02:35:00]  Click on that, please.  Oh, shit.  That's disgusting.  What is that?  You like that?  Jesus.  What about that mess from...  What about that mess Samantha  from Sex and the City?  She never turned me on.  Even when she was young,  she didn't do it for her.  But Sarah Jessica Parker  in a fucking heartbeat.  She's okay.  The Charlotte Epsa-fucking-Litley,  the black-haired one.  How about Rue McClanahan  from The Golden Girls?  The saucy one.  No.  The one I was talking about  in the break?  Betty White?  No, no, no.  The one I was talking about 
[02:35:30]  looked just like Sarah Jessica Parker.  By the way, yeah.  I love Sarah Jessica Parker.  No.  I mean, I reckon...  Why the judgment?  I don't get it.  I don't judge you.  I'm happy if you do it,  but I don't get it.  That's true.  It's no judging.  I guess we're just  pouring our own taste  onto you and thinking.  I know.  You wouldn't fuck  Kim Cattrall and Mannequin?  I'm not saying I wouldn't.  She just never really  turned me on.  There's something about her  she just never...  I recognize that she's attractive.  She just doesn't turn me on.  She's not my... 
[02:36:00]  But she seems like  a cool motherfucker.  Oh, yeah?  I've seen her in interviews  and stuff.  She's really fucking...  You know who's  an old lady  who I probably still bang now?  Who's that?  Nancy Reagan?  From fucking...  Look who's talking  and cheers.  I can't think of her name.  Kirstie Alley.  Don Travolta?  Kirstie.  Big fat pig.  Jesus.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know.  Something about her look like...  I know she's a big fat  old lady now,  but something about her  is still sexy.  That's if you want to go old  and pigging at the same time.  Lisa Kudrow?  I'd bang Lisa Kudrow. 
[02:36:30]  She's probably pushing 50  at this point.  Yeah.  Gotta be.  I'd probably just eat her ass  and praise the comeback.  How much I love that show.  Oh, that's an old pick.  Come on.  That's from January.  Sorry, I'd probably still have it.  She's up big again, though.  She up big again.  Kirstie, she probably has great tits.  Shelly Long?  I'd fuck Shelly Long right now.  Look up Shelly's got a...  I haven't seen her in years on anything.  Rhea Perlman's single.  I'd rather fuck Danny DeVito.  That's mean.  Why'd I say that?  I'm a big fan of hers.  Look, I'd bang her in a second. 
[02:37:00]  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I just can't...  No, not in that one.  Well, that's what she looks like now.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I'm sorry, Dan.  Who is that?  Diane Keaton?  No, I'd fuck her.  Would you fuck Diane Keaton?  I would have up to and including  something's gotta give  after that  when she got a little too old.  Up to and including.  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.  How could you...  I can't look at this motherly thing.  No.  This grandma-looking women  and think anything sexual about them. 
[02:37:30]  They make noise when they kiss you.  Mwah.  Mwah.  It all smells like powder  and fucking...  Like some kind of fucking shit  they need to put on themselves.  Goldie fucked her face up.  Goldie'd still be cute  if she didn't fuck her face up  with all the plastic surgery,  you bird.  Oh, no.  No.  She really...  God damn, she's had too much surgery.  Doughy ass.  Who the fuck wants that?  No one.  It's like fucking holding a big pillow.  Go away.  Buzz off, lady.  Buzz off?  Scram.  It's used all terms. 
[02:38:00]  Buzz off.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  That is not Goldie Hawn.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  But she's had surgery  and then she let...  If you get surgery once,  you've got to stay on top of it  or else that starts to happen.  Holy shit.  How old is she?  Yeah, she doesn't look good.  She's got to be seven.  She looks like Mark Hamill.  Poor old shit.  It looks like a fucking...  A mask.  That looks like something you see  in a fucking...  Yoda.  A makeup artist's room.  Yes.  Look up...  Look up...  What's her face?  Who's the chick from fucking... 
[02:38:30]  Damn, dude.  Who's the chick from...  Oh, Meg Ryan?  Oh, Sharon Stone.  Sharon Stone.  No, Meg Ryan looks terrible.  Sharon Stone.  I fucked Shannon Tweed.  I still fucked.  Oh, God.  Shannon Tweed is 50 years old.  Stop it.  I fucked, yes.  She's sexy.  Stop it.  I would fuck Sharon Tweed, man.  You can't.  You can't.  Stop.  And don't give me one of those pictures  through the Vaseline lens.  Right there.  You wouldn't fuck this lady.  No.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She looks like someone's fucking grandmother.  Stop it.  Oh, stop it.  She's a grandma. 
[02:39:00]  Look.  Oh, stop it.  You stop it.  I'd fuck her.  Stop it, aunt.  You're as perverted on the other end  of the spectrum as I am.  Exactly.  And I do not judge you.  You both like him in diapers  just for different reasons.  Look up Sharon Stone.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  What's her face?  In two seconds.  Chrissy for Three's Company.  No, I saw her recently.  First of all, A, she's a cunt.  She didn't want to take pictures  with anybody.  Suzanne Somers is a flat-assed cunt. 
[02:39:30]  Flat-assed?  Yeah.  She didn't want to take photos  with anybody.  She's a cunt and an old lady.  All right.  Sharon Stone.  Still?  Eps-a-fucking-lutely.  Who's that chick?  The blonde.  Where?  Which?  In the yellow dress.  She's from some soap operas.  Oh, Morgan Fairchild.  Oh, Morgan Fairchild.  Yeah, Morgan Fairchild still looks great.  Really?  It's a lot of makeup, but...  Yeah, it's just... 
[02:40:00]  There's one thing,  a Hollywood glamour photo like that,  and then them laying down there  on the bed or the couch  with nothing on,  and it would have to be  like fucking...  Look, this is a page  designed for me and Ant.  Here's mine.  It scrolls out.  The title of this thread  that we found was  oldest woman you'd be willing  to fuck.  Right.  So then there's this.  Here's Ant's section.  Somebody put a fucking  eight-year-old on there  and some shit.  Fucking guys. 
[02:40:30]  Dude, Ant,  I'm telling you,  I texted you this a while ago.  Oh, yeah.  Gina Davis used to be fucking hot.  She's not hot at all.  She's here today, actually.  Is she really?  Yeah, let me see a picture of her.  I never found her hot either, though.  She was.  She never did it for me.  Oh, you know what she was hot in?  Too tall.  Who else do you like?  Gina Lola Brigida?  She's fucking hot.  That Gina Lola Brigida.  Who's Gina Lola Brigida?  Some ancient fucking actress.  Dude, I texted you this before.  We gotta...  I'm telling you,  we gotta go to bars  and find moms and daughters 
[02:41:00]  that hang out with each other.  Oh, my God.  What a twisted man you are.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with that?  That's kind of sick.  You're grody.  Why is that sick?  Let's say we gotta fuck them  at the same time  in the same room, you creep.  I'm just saying,  we could kill.  We could kill.  We'll mop up that market.  We kill?  What mothers and daughters  go out and want to have sex?  I know.  Look for older...  Father's funeral, sir.  They're both grief-stricken. 
[02:41:30]  The judgment's off.  Oh, God damn.  I never found Gina Davis hot.  Dude, she's fucking hot, man.  How are you not seeing  these pictures?  I never found her hot, man.  Let me get a good one.  She just did...  She's got that model thing  where she's real tall.  I just don't...  I don't know.  It's not my thing.  I don't think she's ugly.  I just...  She just doesn't turn me on.  I never thought  she was incredibly sexy,  but in a league of...  Dude, she looked really good.  Like, she just looked really good.  She's pretty.  She just doesn't do it for you. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, she's fucking hot.  What time is she here?  I'm gonna go kiss her.  Listen, her and the other one  in that fucking flick.  The little sister, too.  Ugh.  I forgot her name.  Lori Petty?  Lori Petty.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Find some Lori Petty.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you go outside  and look at a rat?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, she looks...  Things have changed since 1994.  She looks terrible.  She never was hot.  She was never hot.  She was cute in that movie.  Look, she's a cute little girl.  Yeah, she's fucking adorable, Danny.  She's Gina Davis' little sister. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Joe, now you're passing judgment.  Well, yeah, because I'm getting kicked around,  so I gotta throw it on somebody else  for a little while.  Well, no, look.  I will agree with you.  She looks awful.  She looks like she was in the fucking  secret of NIMH.  She does not look good now.  Maybe 20-something years ago.  She looked okay.  She stinks.  Joe, just because you like  Uncle Junior in a wig.  He was the only one who was fucking  he couldn't jerk off anymore  when the mom died after season two. 
[02:43:00]  All right, Lori Petty looks good there.  All right, yeah, yeah.  All right, she had a little vibe going on.  All right, I was wrong.  Little bet.  Little bet.  Dice, would you fuck Lori Petty?  I ain't right in a race hole.  Hey, come here.  Hey, a cock of your own.  Oh, let me glue shut those baby blues.  Gush, gush. 
[02:43:30]  Shit, she looks really hot there  with that fucking...  Yeah, she looks like fucking Katy Perry there.  What?  She's got those big eyes,  making that face.  Oh, she looks really hot there.  Go down to that one.  Is she naked?  Or she looks old  with fucking gray hair.  Yeah, who else do you like?  Kim Carnes?  Kim Carnes.  Kim Carnes.  This lady.  You wouldn't bang this lady  on Fox right now.  The blonde.  Well, she's one of those Fox-like news girls.  But that's my...  But she's like 50. 
[02:44:00]  This is my point.  She ain't no 50, by the way.  I want to fuck...  You want to fuck Edie Falco?  No, I don't find Edie Falco hot.  I want to fuck a hot, older woman like that.  She ain't 50.  Well, what is she?  45?  I bet she's early 40s.  I don't know, dude.  When you say 55, 60,  that's fucking like crazy.  All right, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit.  No, you're not,  because you thought about it,  and that's where your fantasy lies.  Why are you going to throw me out on a bus like this?  Fucking old handicap bus. 
[02:44:30]  Throwing you under the wheelchair.  How about Greta Van Susteren?  Yeah.  Do you like Greta?  Here's the thing.  Nice, sexy name like Greta.  Awkward kisses.  Do any older women listen to the show?  No.  None, right?  About women.  By at all.  Yeah, that's a good point.  No, I don't think they do.  There you go.  Look at Grandma.  Oh, Joe, pick one off that page.  Mary Tyler Moore.  That isn't famous.  Third row, right.  Helen Mirren at the end on the red.  Helen Mirren, top right. 
[02:45:00]  Absolutely.  Mary Tyler Moore in that picture.  Mary Tyler Moore.  Absolutely.  You told me to pick one off the page.  What do you want from me?  I'm doing my best here.  What are you throwing at me?  Right there.  Fucking, what's her face?  Bernadette Peters.  Absolutely.  Bernadette Peters.  Yeah, there you go.  Fucking ingenue of Broadway.  You know what we should really be looking at?  What?  We should be looking at like 60-year-old women and then mug shots because those are the real  60-year-old women.  That's what they look like the next morning without the makeup. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  This is an accurate depiction.  It is.  That old lady kiss.  There you go.  Your charm bracelet's rattling.  Well, no.  She's gross.  I wouldn't have sex with her.  Come on, honey.  Show me what you got.  What about Laura here?  No.  I think these are dregs of society.  The hair's like straw.  It lost every bit of that youthful, silky vibrance.  Yeah, but these are real women.  Oh, shut up.  You just want to fuck girls or something.  Use baby shampoo. 
[02:46:00]  No.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nice little fucking Johnsons in your eye.  Yeah, who wants tears in it?  Who wants tears?  No more tears.  No more tears.  From me.  If you...  If you...  If you...  If you...  If you...  Jesus.  What's the matter with you?  How about Cheryl Ladd now?  Let's see.  And Cheryl...  Let's look at all the Charlie's Angels except for old ass cancer.  Oh, Jesus.  What? 
[02:46:30]  She's dead when you're not...  Almighty.  Was you a fuck pharaoh on her side?  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, I'd fuck Cheryl Ladd now.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  Without a fucking doubt.  Yeah?  Not bad.  Yeah, I can't...  All right.  I can't find a terrible picture.  I'm not passing judgment.  This...  That's all I'm doing.  There's a...  Oh, forget it.  I don't have to go for the older chicks.  No, no.  Cheryl Ladd...  And they're all entitled, too.  Look at her. 
[02:47:00]  Chicks in their 30s and 40s...  I should say late 30s.  They want you to pick them up.  They're the fucking worst.  You're right.  They're not as giving as 22-year-olds.  I'm telling you.  Try getting a naked picture from someone that fucking...  Who's 35 or 36.  Ah, you know, you gotta take me out to...  Hello?  Hello?  It's...  Click.  Fuck you.  Class of 86.  Fuck you.  She thinks her hearing's going.  You just hung up on her, though.  Oh, it just annoys me.  Um, no, but come on, dude. 
[02:47:30]  You can say that about...  You can say that about young chicks, too.  You gotta take them out.  You gotta fucking...  You could say that older women are...  There's no bullshit.  There's no games.  There's a lot of bullshit.  I've tried with older women recently.  They're all bullshit.  There's a lot more bullshit than younger women.  But there's a lot of bullshit with younger chicks, too.  Not the same type of bullshit, and it's tolerable bullshit.  Because it's young pussy.  Depending on what you're willing to put up with.  You know what I mean?  Look.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Okay?  Okay?  I'm in.  Hear me out.  I'm with you.  Just hear me out for a second. 
[02:48:00]  I'm with you, Joe.  With a younger chick, you gotta deal with this type of bullshit.  We were supposed to hang out, and then she fucking flaked.  We're gonna hang out, but she's upset that I don't wanna go do karaoke with her and her  friends first.  We're supposed to hang out, but she's too fucking drunk, and she's being annoying.  That's bullshit with a younger chick.  Now, is it tolerable?  Well, it depends on what your tolerance level is for stuff like that.  With an older chick, there's a different series set for bullshit.  But, if you're willing to deal with, uh, you know, she wants to be fucking taken to 
[02:48:30]  dinner, or she wants to-  You see what I'm saying?  It's just different-  Older women are fucking flakes.  They cancel.  They suck.  That's not true.  It is.  Older women are way more into accountability than younger chicks.  I think.  I can't stand them.  This is-  I'm gonna lose this argument.  It's not an argument, though.  It's just a taste thing, you know.  But nobody-  This is a losing debate here.  No, a lot of guys agree with you.  Marissa Tomei.  Marissa Tomei.  Marissa Tomei.  She might be the winner.  Yeah.  Because she's like 47, and she looks really, really good. 
[02:49:00]  She's fucking amazing.  And she's a woman.  She's a real woman who's lived and has thoughts.  One of the new mics coming in.  That whole story is bullshit.  Oh, come on.  Are you talking about, well, she's got those experiences.  It's a-  Ah.  It'll just run through the mill at that age.  Yeah.  Oh, giving up on every bit of fucking happiness and fantasy and fucking imagination.  It all comes down to the realism that the womb is drying up.  I like how you talk about pussy like you're Walt Disney right now. 
[02:49:30]  Would you bang, uh, Bailey J?  Oh, in a second.  Oh, God.  I've come to the decision that I would, if I hooked up with Bailey J, I would absolutely  suck her dick.  Wow.  I finally have come to, like, the conclusion of that.  You would.  It took me a long time to figure it out, but I would.  Everyone else figured it out immediately.  Yeah, yeah.  We all had you pegged on that one.  Now-  Stephanie might be the hottest mom that there ever was.  She's retarded hot.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  How old is she? 
[02:50:00]  She's, like, 42 or 3.  I thought she was younger.  So you'd fucking just latch your mouth around that fat man's cock.  Yeah, but just her, though.  I don't want to do that with any other tranny.  Like, we've been down this road.  Oh, the old dirt road.  I'll say.  When's the new Mike's coming in, by the way?  Rob said Monday.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Michelle Pfeiffer.  Totally.  Oh, God.  Lookit, she's like a grandma.  I wouldn't fuck her after Scarface.  Look at those tees on Geena Davis. 
[02:50:30]  Let me see, let me see, you know.  You wouldn't fuck Michelle Pfeiffer after Scarface?  I'm kidding.  I'd fuck her at Hollywood Nights first.  Witches of Eastwick?  She's fucking really hot.  Yeah, I remember.  She was good in that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was pretty.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  Come back from the bathroom after a nice activity of shit.  Hi, Joe.  There is nothing worse than watching Jamie Lee Curtis push fucking regularity on TV. 
[02:51:00]  It's all about taking a good dump with her.  Look, Heather Locklear in a fucking New York Minute.  That age is not correct, so this is four years ago, so you could add four to every number  that you see.  Okay.  So she's 51.  Okay.  Yes.  Taliyana total.  Taliyana's only 46?  Oh, no, 46.  That's, yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Patricia Arquette got fat, but I would fuck her.  Not there.  She got big, though, man.  If you watch her on Medium, she's a little big.  Courtney Cox, definitely.  I've never seen Medium. 
[02:51:30]  Hollywood chicks are the wrong.  Gina Gershon, is that her?  Who's that?  Who's that right there?  Right there with the fucking light blue.  Kelly Hugh?  Kelly Hugh.  I'd fuck her.  Oh, yeah.  Michelle Files.  Absolutely.  There you go.  Lucy Lawless.  Yeah, look, you'll find some hot chicks in that age group, but basically.  Jennifer Tilly, yeah.  Jennifer Tilly?  Of course I'd suck her tits.  She's fat now, right?  Jennifer Tilly's fat?  Well, I think she's always all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  Up and down. 
[02:52:00]  She's one of those fat teeters.  She's like Britney Spears, where you're like, if it's right on point, it's on point, but  it could explode at any minute.  Is that the high limit?  Is that riding the high limit all the time?  Yeah, it's like right there.  Just at the high tolerance.  She looks great, man.  I don't know.  That dress hides a lot.  Who's that?  I'll tell her.  So you can tell here.  There's not a lot of fat here.  Yeah.  This isn't all fat.  You know what would make a much more honest assessment of these women?  If there were nude pictures of them.  Because you're looking at them at their fucking ultimate best. 
[02:52:30]  Dressed with all the fucking gear they need to hold everything up and cinch it down and  tie it back.  With their Spanx on.  Right.  How would you like it if the young ladies that you date looked at you with this sort  of discrimination?  I'm sure most do.  Hey, why the fuck do you think, like today, I'll be swinging kettlebells with my trainer?  Right.  That's what these girls are doing.  With women, it's different, my friend.  They fall apart real fucking quick.  And it's a provider. 
[02:53:00]  Imagine, now how many of them would fuck in if he was broke and not famous?  What you provide is fucking, and provides what a man's supposed to provide at that age,  what a woman is not able to provide at that age, which is her looks.  But these women could provide those things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not saying that they don't like you, but you know what I mean.  There's an extreme double standard on men and women.  Men is providing.  We have to provide if we can give them a comfortable life.  That's what they look for in us.  They look for different shit. 
[02:53:30]  Women you call old, men get distinguished.  Yes.  Yeah.  If you were broke.  Yeah.  If you were fucking broke.  Right.  And you wanted to bang chicks in their 20s, I'm sure you still would.  Right?  Jesus.  What?  Right?  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  How would you like it if they go, ew, gross.  You have no imagination at your age.  You got no vision.  Eh.  All right.  Well, maybe when you reach fucking 60, you could get some sick fetish bitch that'll fuck  you. 
[02:54:00]  But do you understand?  Do you see my point?  Women don't look at it that way.  Women look at older guys differently.  Are you saying you date sick fetish bitches?  No, I'm saying you're a sick fetish guy.  And when you reach 65, some woman, some girl's going to want to fuck you.  And she'll be as twisted as you are right now.  Hey, glass houses, aunt.  Glass houses.  That's all I'm going to say.  We're just lopping stones over here, aren't we?  But no, it's realistic.  Men, as we get older, younger chicks will fuck us.  I'm not insulting you.  You are insulting him.  Am I insulting him?  No. 
[02:54:30]  I'm just trying to make the point of, you know, if the shoe was on the other, you  know, what's the thing?  If you want the painted shoes on the other, the cane is in the other hand.  Exactly.  The hurry cane.  Ah, fuck it.  Look, I just like older chicks.  Oh, yeah.  If there's any older women listening right now, drop me a line.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, get on your fucking jitterbug and fucking text.  Oh, can you text on the jitterbug with the giant buttons so they can just dial 911 in 
[02:55:00]  their speed dial?  Ah, Jesus.  You're a fucking cocksucker.  You know that?  That's great.  God damn it.  Listen.  That's fucking nice.  Imagine you take her to a fucking wedding.  You got to do that wheelchair dance with her.  She's in her hover round.  Oh, God.  Everybody thinks she's the greeter.  Yeah.  Great.  You're fucking Captain Christopher Pike. 
[02:55:30]  Listen, older ladies.  Look what Ashton Kutcher did.  He had an older lady fetish and then Demi Moorhead's 50 and he's like, what am I doing?  And he gets Mila Kunis.  Oh, man.  Ah.  See?  See that?  What happened?  I'm not a big Mila Kunis fan.  No, she doesn't have much of an ass on her.  She doesn't.  And she...  She what?  You know, I'm trying not to be insulting for no reason, but she looks...  She just looks to me like one of those chicks where, like, if you're super all up, she looks 
[02:56:00]  great, but I just feel like in the morning she's nowhere near that fucking high.  Really?  Let me see.  She just strikes me as that kind of chick.  I don't know why.  There's just something about her.  Oh, no makeup.  Yeah.  Let's look.  Let's see.  Mila Kunis, no makeup.  See?  She's got kind of a weird head.  Yeah.  Let me see.  See?  Let's get a full...  You know.  I think for no makeup, you could do a lot worse.  Yeah.  I'm not saying she's awful.  I'm just saying, like, when people go and she's the hottest girl in the world, it's like, 
[02:56:30]  come on, guys.  She's not.  There's...  Dude, I saw her on, like, Family Guy Live where they just do, like, two hours of Family  Guy on a stage.  I couldn't take my eyes off her.  Like, she was really beautiful and she was very sexy, but I knew deep down, like, it's all  which is funny.  I'm just going to keep throwing things at the wall until somebody agrees with something  I say.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking...  Ah, and some of those days...  I'll suck Bailey J's dick.  I'll suck it, too.  There you go.  Everyone's on board there, Joe. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, I'm in the corner with a cock in my mouth jerking off to a fucking geriatric magazine.  You lost me at geriatric.  Ah, shit.  Well, I don't know.  It's just...  You know, but dude, look at the jump.  That's the picture that ruined it for me forever.  Yeah, look.  That's the picture that ruined it for me forever.  She's got no ass.  She's got no boobs.  She's real tiny.  And she looks like she would have that weird Indian girl skin up around her legs and vagina. 
[02:57:30]  Do you know what I'm talking about?  That weird blotchy...  Like, why is there, like, white spots up here?  Do you know what I'm talking about?  I thought you were going to mention, like, maybe hair above her, the small of her back.  Oh, she looks like...  Yeah.  She looks like she needs to have waxings done daily.  But look at her there.  She's smoking there.  Look at her face there, to the other picture.  Let me see the ass on that.  Hmm. 
[02:58:00]  Nothing.  It's just flat.  I mean, look.  She obviously has two chunks of flesh that make up something called an ass.  But that's nothing impressive that I want to...  I'm never calling my friends going, you gotta see this.  Not for the ass.  That's part of it.  That's part of it.  She looks like the kind of girl you'd fuck at, like, a fucking festival where you camp out.  She's got, like, a real flip-flops.  Really?  Not like a hippie girl kind of a thing?  Do you know what I'm saying?  I don't think so.  Not her.  I know the type you're talking about. 
[02:58:30]  But, um...  I don't know.  Oh.  That's where we go.  Well, what's that?  All right.  What's that?  I guess those are, what, Maxim pictures or something?  Yeah, something like that.  But she won, like, GQ's, like, sexiest...  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  She is not this...  Bitch of all time, motherfucker or some shit.  I don't know.  There's no...  Jessica Biel blows her out of the fucking water.  Jessica Biel is retarded hot.  Scarlett Johansson is the sexiest woman in Hollywood.  Scarlett Johansson.  Very sexy. 
[02:59:00]  But also, but another fat teeterer.  Give her another 30 years, maybe.  Right, Joe?  She's another...  I don't like how she stands up so straight.  Yeah, that's...  Let time do some work on her spine, then I'm fucking it.  That's right.  I like a girl that can wash down her Boniva with whiskey.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Those are the pictures.  That's a fucking ass.  Yeah, that's a great ass. 
[02:59:30]  God.  Jim, would you take your face and prop it right in that?  Just fucking spread the cheeks apart and just stick your fucking nose in there?  I would try to live inside of it.  Yes, I would.  All right.  That's all your testimony.  Would you go...  I was sitting out of my own business with her father.  She's hot, man.  She's hot, but I burn out on her. 
[03:00:00]  Because, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was everywhere all the time.  She wasn't concealed enough.  And now it's like, all right.  A little overexposed?  It's like seeing, you know, yeah.  It's like after you see a porn star too many times, you're like, all right.  It doesn't turn me on anymore.  As opposed to Susan Sarandon, who's been hidden.  Yeah, what the fuck?  But you know what I mean.  We've seen a lot of sexy...  Pull up Jessica Biel, man.  Jessica Biel.  The hottest. 
[03:00:30]  The most retarded body ever.  I left ass in there.  You're feeling Jessica Biel?  Yeah, well, look at her fucking body, dude.  Yeah, you're right.  Look at that right there, dude.  She is fucking retarded.  Let's see.  Let's see.  It's a little...  What's going on there?  With that fucking...  Oh, okay.  Well, you know what?  Oh, who's that one that was dating that Jamie Kennedy dude?  Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Yeah.  No, no. 
[03:01:00]  Maybe like...  She's not...  What happened?  Ten years ago.  Ten years ago.  Yeah.  Maybe party five years.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  You got to put...  Oh, now?  Oh, boy.  They can...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, look at this, though, dude.  Go to that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that guy has Jennifer Love Hewitt, but he's got that one.  Look at her.  Oh, God.  What the fuck happened to her?  She's got one of those problem bodies.  She's squat and thick, and you can't be short and thick. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, boy.  You got to have a little height on you if you're going to be thick.  Oh, man.  You don't like her brontosaurus legs?  Brontosaurus.  Yeah.  Fucking...  I have peanut butter in my back.  Her fucking eye-roll cigars legs.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a problem there, but...  They don't look like her.  These are old pictures, too.  Like, if she...  She doesn't have to do a lot to clean up very well.  But she's too short to be that thick, dude.  You can't be that short and that thick.  It goes to shit.  I think she's got to, uh...  Yeah.  It's more like Jennifer like Hewitt. 
[03:02:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's 2007, so...  You know, I'm hoping...  I'm...  I'm going for improvements.  Oh, she fucking went to the beach like that.  She doesn't give a fuck.  You know?  She's already on the fucking horse whisperer.  She doesn't give a care.  Hmm?  I bet she does care.  I don't like that.  I gotta fix my prick.  Come on, she looks good.  What are you doing?  You getting a little excited?  No, my helmet was getting pushed inside.  You know when the head gets shoved inside the tube? 
[03:02:30]  Because it's pressing against your pants the wrong way?  No.  No.  That's like a little dick thing that happens.  Yeah.  I didn't say I had a fucking horse cock over here.  I'm just...  Oof.  Yeah, my...  The head of my penis sometimes gets pushed inside the shaft.  What?  You know what's very uncomfortable?  When your ball bag...  I wear tighties.  When your ball bag comes out the side of your leg of your tighties a little bit, and you  got to walk around, you're trying to fix it.  You ever have them come out in a pant leg when the elastic isn't very good? 
[03:03:00]  You know what?  No.  You know what?  No.  I haven't.  How does it feel to get disagreed with?  I don't like it very much, John.  No, it doesn't feel very nice coming from a pal, does it?  I don't think I like it very much.  What is she wearing there?  Oh, just something...  Jennifer loves you.  She looks great there.  She's wearing like plastic wrap or something.  And this is recent.  This is from earlier.  There she shaved up a little.  All right.  Then she dropped weight.  She must have been going through a time or something.  She was going through a time.  Yeah, that time was called fucking Jamie Kennedy. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, man.  Want to hear an amazing tweet from Colin Quinn?  Oh, Colin.  Tebow has officially trademarked the Tebow move.  I did the same with my I don't give a care shrug and my kiss my grits point to the butt.  Terrible.  Is he a Nancy on that Twitter?  I'm sure he'll get a bunch of answers from people that think he's an idiot.  Not funny anymore.  Hey, Colin, why don't you give it up? 
[03:04:00]  People that don't understand.  Don't get what he's doing.  Kiss my grits.  Kiss my grits point.  Ass point.  That's hilarious.  That's great.  I stopped reading the mentions.  I won't read my mentions anymore.  Why?  What happened?  Because I'm sick of it.  I don't care anymore.  I don't want to hear every fifth or tenth person going, fuck you.  I'm just sick of it.  Every second person.  Yeah, I don't want to do it anymore.  So how do you know who's responding to your tweets? 
[03:04:30]  I don't give a fuck.  You don't give a care?  I don't give a fuck if you respond.  People that say nice things, I appreciate it.  Thank you.  But the cunt's ruined it, and that's it.  I don't care.  I'm using it to tweet out fucking dates.  If people don't want to follow me because of that, I don't give a fuck.  And to get some old bruds.  No.  No?  You don't want to get some old bruds?  I changed my Facebook page over to just a like page.  I'm done.  Yeah?  I'm done.  I don't want to do it.  I hate it.  I can't fucking stand this shit. 
[03:05:00]  You're done with fucking social media.  Why do I have to be fucking friends with people that want to tell me I'm a fucking asshole?  It's like I don't care anymore.  You know what?  You're all right about that.  I'll agree with you.  Look at that.  They are a bunch of assholes.  Yeah.  It's, you know, and there's cool people out there, too, but it's, you know, it's just,  it's annoying.  If you want to get in touch with me, they'll figure it out, you know?  But, uh...  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, uh...  That's pretty bold in this day and age.  Oh, speaking of plugs. 
[03:05:30]  Most people don't do that.  Oh, yes.  My web series comes out today, Jim.  Yes, it does.  You were in an episode of it.  I was, and I was kind of happy with how it came out.  Kind of happy?  Well, I hate watching myself more than I do.  Oh, why?  You're great at it, dude.  It came out good, but it was, you know, I just don't like watching myself.  Jimmy's very good on film.  He was great.  He was fucking great, and it's funny, and I thank you again.  I would have redone it.  No, you didn't need to redo it.  No, it was Jimmy.  I'm just saying.  Come on, it was great.  He said that like four times on set.  He goes, if you need to reshoot anything, I'll come right down and do it. 
[03:06:00]  I was really touched that he was like that committed to it, you know?  Bill Burr and Opie did a good episode.  Anthony did an episode.  Yeah.  Who else did it?  Bonnie.  Bonnie McFarlane's in one.  Bonnie.  And then some other people.  Carmine Famiglietti, who was in that movie Pounds, he was actually, he did something for  you guys years and years ago, and he said they did some song and you guys trashed him,  but he.  What, that's 600 in Iraq?  He's, I'm sorry, I thought it was, you're right, you're right, you're right, he gave 
[03:06:30]  me the fucking thumbs down and he's right.  Yeah.  But there, anyway, what are we waiting for on youtube.com slash thewarnersound?  Please watch it.  Yes.  Watch them.  They're very good.  And we also, I have to plug dates too.  Well, we have some production, I mean.  Yeah, because the jingle contest is still going on.  Oh, right, yes.  You can send stuff to obanthony at siriusxm.com.  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, if you like 
[03:07:00]  grody jokes.  Oh, fuck.  It's the best character.  It's so annoying, man.  It's the best one.  Oh, is that a bad?  Is that terrible?  Yes.  It's absolutely terrible.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  You like it?  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, if you like  grody jokes. 
[03:07:30]  Jokes?  It's good.  I hate what you do with your voice.  It's very good.  No.  I love it.  I think it's a great fucking character.  It's god-awful.  Yeah, that's fucking terrible.  This weekend, I'll be in Philly.  What am I?  A cheesesteak or something?  Oh.  Cheesesteak.  Everything sold out except for the late show Thursday and Sunday, if you want to come  have a Sunday.  And then, Friday, November 9th, I'll be in Toronto at the Dark Comedy Festival. 
[03:08:00]  Like, hello, get some lights.  And then, November 15th through 17th, I'll be in Addison.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you just add a daughter or something?  That's Valley Chip.  Well, it's something like Oscar Addison from The Odd People.  They're different, you cocksucker.  It's Oscar Addison played, but Jack Klugman. 
[03:08:30]  Is that it for that?  I know we got, oh, the presidential debates tonight.  So, if you want, go to Ustream.com.  Pop in a compound.  Vice or presidential?  Presidential.  Another one?  Yes.  It's the last one about foreign policy.  Ustream.com.  Pop a compound in the search engine.  And I'll be there at, like, 9 o'clock and do a simulcast of said debate.  Big show tomorrow.  Yes.

Oh, I forgot about that.  Peter Criss.  No, you didn't.  No, of course not.  I'm obsessed.  It's all I'm thinking of.  Of course you are.  I fucking, I turned down Leno for tomorrow.  What?  They offered, I was supposed to do Leno, uh, Thursday, but they had a scheduling conflict  and they're like, could you do it Tuesday?  Who's the bigger deal for you, Peter Criss or the big show? 
[03:09:30]  Uh.  Um.  Uh, Peter.  Well.  I couldn't even think I had to answer this.  You're not sure?  His books.  I know, I know, of course, I'm going to praise it.  It's the most revealing fucking rock biography I've ever read.  Some of the stuff he says in there is absolutely not going to make the other guys happy.  Really?  Yeah.  It's great.  I can't wait to hear his take on some of this Gene Simmons stuff, seeing as how I really  am not a fan of Gene Simmons. 
[03:10:00]  Well, I think you and Pete will have a lot in common.  Oh, righty.  That sounds good.  Yeah.  He dishes the dirt.  Yeah.  I like a good dirt disher when it comes to that.  I don't like these books where they're all coy.  I like when they come right out and slam people.  He didn't care.  That's right.  Where's Gene?  I want to get a picture of Gene Davis.  Yeah.  Where is she?  Yeah.  After we just trashed her.  We didn't trash her.  I didn't.  No.  I don't think we trashed her.  She wasn't so random.  We trashed.  Yeah.  She reminds me of this.  She's like the same type.  Yeah.  I have a little fucking respect. 
[03:10:30]  Bunch of old ladies.  Hey.  Yeah.  My friend went to jail for giving oral sex.  What?  In Kansas.  They're interfering with people's relationships.  Marriages.  Oh, God.  She was asking for it.  My friend gives her oral sex.  No.  Sure.  Sure.  And he goes to jail because everybody's so bigoted.  Yeah, that's true.  That's disgusting.  When did that happen? 
[03:11:00]  I know.  It gave him life.  That is disgusting.  No, it's the act that's disgusting.  Mind your business.  What's wrong with that?  It's terrible.  Well, he was giving oral to a four-month-old girl.  And he was, what, 25?  Yeah, he's a good boy.  What the fuck, man?  He's spreading joy.  Horrible.  He's spreading joy.  And those killjoys gave him jail.  How do you fucking...  They gave him life.  This is the problem.  How do you what?  How do you do that?  No. 
[03:11:30]  You got it.  The hard part is the legs are always...  No, no, no.  I didn't even ask.  The legs are always kicking in your ears.  I was going to have to fall.  Oh, boy.  Don't...  It's...  You ever get kicked in the ear with a...  You ever get...  You ever get kicked in the ear with a baby?  It'll pop your eardrum. 
[03:12:00]  That little baby heels.  They're a lot stronger than they think.  I got that bad guy.  Ow!  You just kicked me in both my ears at the same time.  Bad boy slash girl.  Fucking A.  Gina Davis just walked by.  Oh, she did.  Oh, there she goes.  She go that way?  Is she going to the gay channel?  I believe so.  It looks that way.  We're going into the gay zone. 
[03:12:30]  The Fly is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Oh, I forgot she was in that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a good one.  I want to get her.  Her gold blue.  Her run the fly.  Yes.  Oh, we're creepy.  So creepy, man.  Yeah.  You know?  He does a great job in that way.  Oh, a fly got into the telepod.  Fucking creep.  They hire him.  They go, just be Jeff Goldblum.  Yeah, yeah.  You're Jeff Goldblum.  Go.  Just do.  Jeff, just act like yourself.  He's always Jeff Goldblum. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  He didn't even know they were...  He didn't even know what the plot of the movie was.  Just be yourself.  Why do we got to keep talking about flies the whole time?  Just be yourself.  Oh, he's so creepy.  I love him, man.  I fucking love him.  Wasn't this everybody's favorite part of Jurassic Park?  When Jeff Goldblum is just lounging with his shirt off for no apparent reason?  Oh, with his shirt open?  And yeah, yeah.  I didn't like that part.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, I did.  It was my favorite.  He's a good looking dude, man.  Literal, Jimmy.  He old enough for you?  He is.  So would you suck his cock, too? 
[03:13:30]  Eh, you know.  Put a wig on, baby.  Fucking, it's Joe DeRozoon when he gets old.  I look like Young Goldblum.  Mess space.  Well, what a great time I've had today.  Joe DeRozoon, thanks so much for popping in.  Thanks for having me, guys.  It was a lot of fun per usual.  I had a nice time.  Of course, Young Sam, thank you.  Stay tuned for the after show made of shit.

Dr. Gay, Johnny, on the spot with his, um, a what?  With his, uh, uh, disc of...  It's Travis Gay, MD.  Travis Gay, MD.  I like that.  And, of course, uh, the guy on the board. 
[03:14:30]  What's the matter, Chipper?  Oh, my God.  Roland's got a police shirt or something.  What are you, going to jail or something?  Oh, no, it's the band Police.  Oh.  What is that?  Valley Chip?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He nodded his head in sheer excitement.  Yeah, it's Valley Chip.  I hate Valley Chip, too.  Believe me.  Yeah?  Well, you should go hate something else or something.
