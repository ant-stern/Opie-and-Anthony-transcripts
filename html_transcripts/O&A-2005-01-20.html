<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely characterized by vulgarity, offensive humor, and frequent digressions.  The show opened with Jimmy Norton expressing extreme anger and using highly offensive language about his mistreatment by the Gotham Comedy Club, which denied him stage time for a “bringer show.”  He detailed his resentment with explicit descriptions of his alleged "sexual addiction."  This led to a discussion about the upcoming, and highly unwelcome, work trip to Washington D.C., including mandatory sensitivity training specifically designed for Norton, which the hosts viewed with considerable skepticism and disdain.  A new intern, Noah, dressed in a suit, became a recurring target of mockery due to his formal attire and professional demeanor, with the hosts and staff making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive jokes about his appearance and behavior.

The show then delved into commentary on American Idol auditions, focusing on the contestants' singing abilities (or lack thereof), personalities, and physical appearances, often using highly derogatory and offensive terms.  Specific contestants highlighted, with offensive descriptions, included Joe ("a package"), Justin Smith (whose performance prompted a desire for Ike Turner to "rape him on a console"), Adam and Dirk (portrayed as gay lovers), and a Michael Jackson impersonator. The hosts analyzed their performances and personalities, frequently interrupting themselves with listener calls, and criticizing Simon Cowell's judging style.  A bizarre tangent involved a seven-year-old boy wiping a booger on Anthony's couch, sparking a conversation about booger-eating habits.  Crude and offensive language was pervasive throughout this segment.

Later, the show featured a discussion about Ashley Simpson's singing ability and the hosts' perceived lack of skill, alongside feedback received from advertising executive Donnie Deutsch via their website.  This led to Deutsch being brought into the studio.  A significant portion was dedicated to Deutsch's upcoming CNBC show, "The Big Idea," and an account of their difficult interview with Chevy Chase, including Chase's admission to leaving Saturday Night Live for a woman and an anecdote about encountering a transgender person during the interview.  The hosts also advertised a fictitious, offensive daycare run by Anthony, filled with dark humor about hating children.  They further discussed their experiences with XM radio, marketing strategies (or lack thereof), and compared their success (or lack thereof) to Howard Stern's on Sirius.  Deutsch offered marketing advice, suggesting a campaign highlighting attempts to suppress the show.  This segment also involved an interview with Deutsch’s attractive assistant, Stephanie, further ribbing of intern Noah, and Deutsch sharing insights on his wealth, success, and relationships.

A subsequent segment compared the contrasting styles of two interns—one formally dressed, the other in a Metallica shirt—and their perceived attractiveness.  This transitioned into a discussion about male grooming, followed by an anecdote about Anthony exposing himself to women after a male strip show.  Donnie Deutsch made a guest appearance again, followed by more commentary on his attractive assistant.  A significant portion involved a hostile and extremely offensive rant aimed at a Canadian caller, replete with homophobic and nationalistic slurs. This was followed by a discussion of the mandatory sensitivity training, particularly Norton's resistance, which was later revealed to be an elaborate prank by Eric Logan and Ben Sparks.  Audio clips from Pat from Munaki, interspersed with further discussion of the Boston dirty bomb hoax and updates (or lack thereof) from the producers’ drunk "Boston friends," concluded this segment, along with more ribbing of Norton and an update on intern Noah's height and weight.

The broadcast concluded with extensive riffing on Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's press conference regarding the dirty bomb threat, mocking his speech and recounting a past prank involving falsely reporting his death.  The focus shifted back to Noah, with the hosts making numerous sexually suggestive remarks and jokes, discussing potential dates for him, including a black woman.  A "Guess What's in My Pants" segment involved a female caller describing her pubic hair using phone sounds. The show also included plugs for Dean Edwards' stand-up show and further mentions of Donnie Deutsch and his CNBC show.  Throughout, the tone remained highly sexually charged, vulgar, and irreverent.

[00:31:00]  get up in the morning to put on a uh three-piece suit oh put on a suit it's like i i know it takes me  forever just to get dressed in the winter you know you got to put everything on all the stupid layers  i'm all tired it takes forever well people got some uh opinions about the new intern already jim  from massachusetts go ahead jim hey guys what's going on hey i smell something and it's not an  intern's breath that new guy he's a mole he's an xm plant sent there to keep an eye on little jimmy 
[00:31:30]  no they even xm wouldn't be dumb enough to to make them dress like that and come in here  yeah if they were going to have a plant in here it would be i don't know somebody that would fit in  yeah that's not like a sore thumb like fan yeah yeah he'd be the perfect plan then you're not as  conspicuous i don't know i'm punching on i just wanted to let that one in guys you guys rock well  are you searching for the terrorists up there in massachusetts i just could be me and tom manino  we're actually going to power all about you and they go out to the terrorists yeah we got to get the 
[00:32:00]  audio of uh the mayor of boston talking about the terrorist alert up there manino we're looking  we've got information that there's a dirty bomb a dirty bomb shut up your mumble mouth fat-tongued  mongoloid is jackass a dirty bomb the police and fire department the police and fire department have  been notified that there is a chance that a dirty bomb oh i was listening to him mumble on the news 
[00:32:30]  last night can we get the audio of him because we're looking for four zipper heads with a dirty bomb  ben's like you know what when they find these four um what asian people i guess four different people  i thought it was the same guy four times they're never gonna find them what's the delivery system for  the dirty bomb a bike with a basket on the front that guy in the middle drew my picture on broadway 
[00:33:00]  well the front page of the post wanted fbi hunts dirty bomb terrorists up there in boston it's four  chinese nationals described as possible terrorist suspects who passed through new york are being  hunted in connection with a potential dirty bomb attack in boston the fbi said yesterday the boston  hurl reported that the chinese were involved with two iraqis but boston mayor thomas menino  said he had no information about that i have no information about anything 
[00:33:30]  why don't they just call up ben well i'm sure he knows everything about the situation i know ben's  hard at work in the office that's what he does these days but he has to come in here because  he was losing his mind we got in and he's like just you hear what's going on in boston  you you know what when they find these four they're gonna kill him his friends have already been  calling him his friends have already called up uh ben and the the little gossip circle is going  already and ben uh he knows everything so he probably knows where these people are  what do you think the dirty bomb is gonna be it's gonna be an m80 wrapped up in ben's underwear 
[00:34:00]  yeah but he's already gossiping back there in the office about this oh he's gossiping wondering  how the pats fit into this whole thing brady was doing coke one of those guys and then  psycho 10k i mean there's two iraqis yeah but uh these guys better not show up in saudi  it can be funny if ben's in boston and then they can pull down his trousers because they think he's  smuggling a dirty bomb in the front of his jeans that couldn't be real son the bomb the iraqis and 
[00:34:30]  all the asians ben what's going on with the dirty bomb those four gooks you know they're dead  i already got friends up in boston like i hope we find him before the cops they've already called  you yeah now that friend's up all night hunting for him you know they're all drunk i'm like guys  come on it's still up drunk friends are hunting hunting the asians psycho tim is uh leading the  search for the ford thanks boston is so self-sufficient it's hilarious they don't need 
[00:35:00]  anything like they're already hunting for him don't send any fbi no one from washington  we got it covered up here i can't even listen to ben anymore because jim does such a great job  with the impression that it is so funny when he comes in here now you you've nailed it it's  hysterical one thing you need to do is how he you know he claps his hands as he does his gossip too  don't don't don't maybe that's why i'm going nowhere in show business my two best impressions are  steve c and ben sparks maybe i should work on nicholson or iggy from taxi 
[00:35:30]  oh my god he is priceless dude they're already hunting tomorrow oh and they're all drunk hunting  for him of course they are well i mean uh you know four chinese people are gonna stick out like a sore  thumb in boston especially in the metropolitan area that's true if they stay out of their area where is  the asian area oh my god they're so segregated that the that chinatown and and boston all right  it's behind that brand new ritz carlton there yeah it is literally like two blocks by two blocks now 
[00:36:00]  postage stamp pretty much pushing them out yeah isn't it by what the uh where is it by the north end or  uh no you know the ritz carlton there the new one yeah i'm not sure where that is bcn uh  remember remember opie i drove a lot in boston so i have no clue where anything is with your stupid  wagon wheel roads oh yeah well um going backwards a little bit anthony you know we have the new 
[00:36:30]  intern noah and his three-piece suit his expensive three-piece suit and his expensive shoes and  nyu student yeah to be honest with you man i i didn't have a three-piece suit growing up i had  nothing hope he's got an open window in his dorm i had absolutely nyu he's on a high floor  look to see him sprawled out in that suit on the sidewalk 
[00:37:00]  well um danny walked in daddy's disappointment leaking into the gutter  danny and uh wow wow they said my mousy voice will never sell advertising  geronimo so danny and uh nathaniel walked in and they uh they have audio of uh  of them uh welcoming the new intern aboard here to the opium anthony program so let's go to the audio  do it 
[00:37:30]  danny really hits him here  remember it's just a bad drink that boy 
[00:38:00]  and now we have audio of noah no are you all right  thinking of that jelly donut in his foot locker how delicious it is  and now we have audio of noah no are you all right 
[00:38:30]  oh look at this i like the fact i don't have to ask young tony perkins for my change  there he is  new intern getting a lot of attention while the other guys just work their balls off behind the  scenes they're just loving this we should change their names actually  yeah now it's not danny nathaniel it's intern one and intern two 
[00:39:00]  featuring our our new intern noah featuring noah and his snazzy attire  i like that i actually got changed back from my money that i gave noah  i like that too it's a rare thing that happens  noah and look at that fan is like throwing his hands up in the air  what what i don't know how many cab rides i've paid for  danny nathaniel are now the backup singers to noah  they sure are  backup singers  i like the fact this kid's out here hustling and number one and number two are just kind of standing in there 
[00:39:30]  oh yeah  all right so the dirty bomb anthony  dirty bomb  yeah so thomas veneno is on top of the situation up there in boston so we're all safe  this is ridiculous  and it just goes to show you i don't know what i'm talking about  because yesterday i was saying uh boy you notice there's no terrorist threats or anything happening in the news  and then uh  this whole thing happens but this is crap  this is another false alarm  it turns out  it was some guy in mexico  that said look i i was paid to smuggle 
[00:40:00]  two iraqis and four asians across the mexican border  they said that some materials  are going to be crossing the border too  a little later on  it's going to go through new york  and up into boston  now if you're a terrorist  and you're transporting a dirty bomb  why would you take it through the pinnacle of the free world new york  the the the biggest you know  city uh... in the country 
[00:40:30]  and why would you then take it through there  to go to boston  and no offense to the rest of the country we're paying a little more attention to this type of thing than everyone else  because what happened to us  yeah yeah  you know you if you get it into new york you blow it up in new york is what you do  you don't take it to boston  and then where are the iraqis  he's got the four pictures of these asians  here's what happened  this guy smuggled these four asian guys across the mexican border  they stiffed them  and he's pissed  so he calls up and says  ah  uh these terrorists crossed the border 
[00:41:00]  i got info i got their pictures go get them  because now he's pissed off that they stiffed the guy  who ever heard of chinese terrorists  it doesn't happen  no they're tellists  they're  it doesn't happen  tellists  and women too  there's like women in there  that's what i was going to say  i couldn't tell if they were women or men  and that's not even a joke  they got the four pictures on the cover of the new york post 
[00:41:30]  and you can't tell  they're bound for restaurant delivery and a yankee cranky shop  that's where they're ending up  not in boston  with a dirty bomb  there's another story about um uh chinese or asian uh delivery guys  or at least one in particular  that got the the crap beat out of them  because  because uh one of these apartments  i i don't know uh exactly where in new york  he was delivering the menus  right  and they kept telling this guy stop with the menu stop stop  you don't understand  it's a major hassle if you  it really is a major hassle 
[00:42:00]  annoying  all right  what do you call it an annoyance  how many little pieces of paper slid under your door  yeah  from restaurants  i catch them doing it  menus  i mean yeah  you  you go up to your apartment door  and there's just menus all over the place  and they just keep coming and coming and coming and coming  and uh  one uh building  had enough  and they just beat the crap out of the guy  because i guess they told him a few times  you know stop with the menus  but  i don't even think the kid knew uh english  and then  yeah  one you know  like the other day  they beat him up  and then like the super or somebody got involved 
[00:42:30]  they held him down  and just beating the crap out  the super too  something like that  we gotta get the  you know  we try to keep the details pretty accurate here  so i'll get the  we'll get the story  but yeah  there's a gang going around new york  i heard on winds this morning  that they uh  there's a gang roving around with baseball bats  that are just beating up asian delivery guys  no really  riding around  yeah  why  i don't know  are they dressed like the yankees with kiss makeup on  the furies  the furies  very good  wow  just beat him with bats 
[00:43:00]  very good  sorry about that four asians  i hear your wonton soup didn't make it to your destination  sorry about that  valerie  what was her name  valerie von valkenberg or something  from too close for comfort  wasn't she in too close for comfort  i think she was in uh  where in the world is carmen's san diego  no she's in a sitcom too  was she  i might have been too close for comfort  yeah  i'd be wrong  yeah  dirty feet  all right  let's go to the phones here  ron the trucker wants in 
[00:43:30]  hey ron what's up  hey how you doing this morning fellas  pretty good ron  pretty good  hey what the fuck is with this new intern  he's got a fucking audience of truck drivers and jack offs  he's in there with a fucking suit  you guys need to tear him up  send his ass back to philly with his daddy  yeah it's a little weird  we're not gonna lie to you  it's a little strange  but he is working  he's not just sitting here  no  he's very efficient  he got jimmy's order down perfectly  and jimmy has a very complicated order every morning  the food he needs 
[00:44:00]  the water  the cereal  i mean it's a mess  he's set up  he needs utensils  like most people don't need utensils in this place  you get something  you open up the foil  and shove it in your mouth  but uh jimmy's like  you gotta get a knife  yeah he needs all sorts of things  and the guy got the order right perfectly right  yeah all i need now is a new sinuses  and a little self-esteem  you know he could whip those up for me  i think nathaniel  it took him about six to eight times  before he got your order right  he doesn't care about my order  i come back to bagels on the floor  right  he steps on it 
[00:44:30]  there's a mealy apple  i think this kid  brings me an apple  that i can throw through a brick wall  i think this kid brings me an apple  that's so crisp  i lose a tooth fighting it  thanks to nathaniel  who just takes applesauce  and wraps it in red paper  and hands it to me  it's like a prostate  how am i supposed to enjoy that every morning  yeah you know what  i'm starting to like the new intern  starting to like him  he's a go-getter  he's a go-getter  what they call it  he pays attention to detail  he's sure he's meticulous 
[00:45:00]  meticulous  meticulous boy  meticulous  very meticulous  what a kid  alright let's go to pete  pete  pete  morning shit dick  good morning  we haven't played that in a while  maybe we'll throw that on  going into break  go ahead pete  i was wondering if you guys  are going to go visit  john's hog  beauty salon  before you guys go to washington  on monday  john's hog  it's john's a hog  i haven't been there a while  punch it out  no i won't be going to john's hog 
[00:45:30]  that's where i go  to get my head done  yeah we should all go to washington  in three-piece suits  yeah  yeah that'll happen  we'll attend all our stupid meetings  in suits  jim in staten island  just like them  hey jim  hey what's up guys  what's up  oh it's good  i just want to let you know  that i was on online  with bernie getz last night  you were  yeah i was  i am i am the bernie pie  and i told him he had a great  music selection  last week  and what did he say to you  uh he was just  he was saying okay 
[00:46:00]  he wasn't really  responding  and at the end i said  i just want to say hello  i wish you a great  upcoming black history month  punch it out guys  all right  yeah what is it  berniepie at aol.com  if you want to talk to the  subway vigilante  subway vigilante  bernie getz  will he be coming in here  soon again  you know what pisses me off  sometimes you think you're  chatting with him  and it's his squirrel  you know  that's annoying  i typed in a few things  and it just said  stop  stop  it was screeching 
[00:46:30]  stop  all right  man beaten by  building super  and a resident  after putting  restaurant leaflets  in their  harlem complex  anthony  harlem  yeah it happened in harlem  beating up an asian guy  chen zhen ping  hi  chen zhen ping  wanted to deliver menus  to the stately harlem co-op  niam shala told him to get lost  by the time it was over  ping 23 a chinese immigrant  had been beaten  and shala the building  superintendent  and another man 
[00:47:00]  a psychiatrist  who lives in the building  really  uh  we're  kind of upper crusty place  we're under arrest  for felony assault  good  the monday afternoon  confrontation at a harlem  apartment building  crystallized the tensions  that often exist  between buildings  opposed to advertising  and restaurants  whose profitability  depends on a healthy  takeout business  yeah they're just  they're out of control  with these menus  yeah but you know something  if you're ordering  from the place  you can't fault them  for leaving the menus  yeah  well they usually just  leave it in the bag  of food that you buy  yeah but you know 
[00:47:30]  here's what they do  if you're in an apartment  building  uh  in your apartment  they deliver to that  apartment  then they slip the menus  under the doors  of the whole floor  that they're delivering to  right  so people that never  deliver get these menus  slid under their doors  too  these guys have  awful lives man  it's like  i know  a chinese guy  who's delivering food  has a great life  he's making no money  he's probably sharing  a room with six people  leave him alone  highlight was the boat  ride in the shipping  container over  the highlight of his life  and now uh  you're giving him 
[00:48:00]  beating him up for menus  the only good thing is  if he wants to do comedy  he can just show up  at gotham with four friends  and they'll throw him  right on  he's bitter about that  one  fire in the entrance  piled up at the door  it's getting uglier  on the instant feedback  fast freddy from  jamaica station  wants to you know  call noah  and the other interns  lovely noah  and the internets  internets  very uh  cute  you know  i i'm almost tempted  to have something drafted

[00:57:00]  Artie in Jersey  what's going on Artie  what is wrong  with the phones  today  are you guys  asleep today  a little slow  are you guys  asleep today  on the phones  no I'm awake  ok why aren't you  talking  this is literally  the 5th or 6th  phone call we've  taken  I mean we love  talking to the  listeners and  allowing you guys  to participate  but man you guys 
[00:57:30]  are real slow  today on the phones  let's go  I'm ready to go  then go  we've wasted  30 seconds already  you haven't said  anything  I just want to  ask Jimmy  how come he's  got a audition  he's so good  why do you have  to do 5 or 10  minutes  in a regular  comedy club  to go on  the tonight show  this guy's informed  about how things  work  yeah tonight show  I mean look  if you got  Seinfeld credibility  they'll just  put you on  but the fact is  they're very cool  with the material  but they have to  see it first  because everybody's  so frightened of 
[00:58:00]  the FCC  and you have to  be careful  and you also  have to make sure  because networks  have standards  and practices  so they want  to make sure  that you're not  going to say  anything disgusting  and also that  the material  will work on the  show  it's actually  a process  that's fine  you know  if you're  Chris Rock  or Chappelle  you know  whatever  you don't  have to do  that  but on my  level  you do  why don't  you just  go down  to the  tonight show  offices  give the  woman the  tape  and just  sit and  wait  wait for  Jay to  come out  because maybe  you spoke  to him  maybe you  spoke to  him in a  limo  I made  Jay laugh  one time 
[00:58:30]  though  because I  said here's  my pride  and joy  and I gave  him a little  card  and I had a  picture of  pride and joy  on it  you know  I'll wait  I'll wait  alright thanks  guys  thanks for the  compliment  that was very nice  feeling cork  dude  De Niro  in that movie  captured awkwardness  and uncomfortability  it was so good  why didn't I say  that when I met  him  this is De Niro  I'm a comedian  that was the  greatest capture  of a comic  psychosis I've  ever seen  why didn't I  say that  instead of  tapping his  arm  Bob  Bob 
[00:59:00]  he called  him Bob  I figured  he's so famous  he'd think  he knew me  right  like he meets  so many people  somewhere  he's calling  me Bob  he knew that  Bob was short  for Robert  it must be  related  this idiot's  calling me  Bob  whizzy  my little  girl  girl scout  fingers  tapping  a man's  arm  tap tap  tap  tap  Bob  I can't  talk right  now  I'm going  to Gotham  you are so  miserable  I know  I feel bad  for Jimmy  today  hang in there 
[00:59:30]  buddy  hang in there  want to talk  about American  Idol Anthony  let's get that  audio  we'll just  figure it out  yeah there's  just a lot  of people  checking out  this show  I don't know  it's kind of  fun but  I'm not  going to  I'm not  going to  I like it  I'm not  going to  make it to  the end  of this  show  no  no way  I like  the show  I'm taking a  peek  because you  know  a lot of  our listeners  are watching  this thing  so maybe we  can goof  on it a bit  but I don't  know  when it starts  getting into  the serious  competition  it's a bore  fest to me  some of the 
[01:00:00]  shows blow  when they do  those theme  shows where  it's you  know all  Broadway  tunes  I'm out  out and  Z  I kind of  like the  preliminaries  and then when  they finish  it up at  the end  you gotta  watch  see who  won  see who's  getting  booted  Steve you  left an  eighth of an  inch of hair  under your  neck  did I  I thought  you did it  on purpose  oh it's a  mistake  you never  know it's  no it's not  a mistake  this thing  under your 
[01:00:30]  neck  every day  Steve comes in  with a new  look  we have a  bunch of  neurotic freaks  around here  and I know  I'm neurotic  as hell  I'm not  saying I'm  better than  anyone else  around here  but Steve  changes his  look every  morning  he has  something  different  going on  and then  we got  an intern  that's walking  around in  like a  two thousand  dollar  freaking  three piece  suit  that's a  little odd  though  I mean  you purposely  kept just a  tiny little  bit of hair  yes you did  dude you know  it's there  no I'm  I'm trying to  do the  goatee again 
[01:01:00]  but I mean  no this  thing  I'll have to  look at the  hair  oh my god  don't even  make believe  that you missed  a spot  boyish and young  that face  yeah exactly  I've got a  freaking baby  Huey face  I didn't  I don't like  you have a  sweet face  you left this  little thing  down here  where'd you get  that idea  from  yeah  little thing  it's a little  tuft  oh you know  what I didn't  want to get rid  of the whole  stripe  I wanted  the outline  of the stripe  to be there  so I left  a little bit  of it  he studies  his face  in the mirror  and says 
[01:01:30]  what can I  do to it  next  you're one  step away  from body  modification  you're an odd  guy  I'm covered  in tattoos  I'm one  step away  from body  modification  I don't mean  that type  of stuff  I'm talking  tattoos are  one thing  but I mean  like where  they actually  will cut  themselves open  and pierce  in a weird  way  no I'm not  into that  I mean I'll  admit I fucking  hate myself  but you know  and I change  myself quite  frankly  if they and I  hang out with a  bunch of people  that hate  themselves  I guess we  should tell  our listeners  that I forgot  about that one  self-loathing  mess and that's  where all this  modification of 
[01:02:00]  appearance  comes from  but  remember the old  days it was  just you and  I  we didn't have  to deal with  all this  and we were  the nuttiest  people  me and you  slammed the  door  we did our  little radio  show  now we got  all these  neurotic freaks  that are worse  than us around  here  a collection  of zilches  you've surrounded  yourself with  a winner in  the bunch  it used to be  just Ant and  I  we've been  doing this  for ten  years  it was just  you and I  buddy  me and you  would produce  the show  we would edit  our bit  we would do  everything  ourselves  now we got 
[01:02:30]  I can't even  count how many  people around  here working  on the show  now  I remember  taking home  production pieces  to my home  computer and  putting together  stuff for the  show  yeah  I had little  clips of the  announcer going  you know  Opie and  Anthony  Opie Anthony  and I'd take  movie clips  and put them  together and  come in the  next day with  tapes and we'd  put them on  cart and use  them that's how  it was just  me and Opie  commercials that  you heard on  our show we  recorded them in  the studio 
[01:03:00]  we did  commercials for  car dealerships  everything  porn shops  and hedge  shops up  in Boston  and yeah  it did  everything  but now  look at  our staff  Opie  look at  what 10  years in  the business  has gotten  us  our staff  of self  hating  kooks  we added  Jim Norton  who any  day could  throw himself  out a window  yeah  we don't  know  no joke  I mean  it could  happen  any day  any day  this really  is a collection  of atrocities  the best way  to feel  better about  yourself  though  is surround  yourself  with people  that feel 
[01:03:30]  worse about  themselves  than you do  that is  kind of a  good point  I wouldn't  mind it  as much  if you  weren't  wearing a  long sleeve  shirt that  didn't come  past your  belt  self hating  Steve  with his  magna doodle  face  Steve's like  I hate myself  so much  I dry my  shirts for  four hours  it's just  getting stranger  and stranger  around here  man  it really  is  oh god  you've got  Ben in the  office  he's just 
[01:04:00]  herking and  jerking  as we do  a radio show  I mean I  can see his  little head  way over  there and  it's just  moving back  and forth  of course  it is  that stupid  Jack Torrance  hairdo he has  he's trying to  type but his  fingers keep  moving  so he's like  dear  he moves  like the  woman walking  out of the  TV set  in the ring  except he  sweats more  his hair is 
[01:04:30]  wetter  I almost  said he  sweats less  that would  have been  silly  oh my god  it's just  a mess  of characters  but we  love them  Steve  what is  going on  here  now I  can't  figure out  where you  want me  to go  with this  well you  said go  and highlight  a bunch  so I  highlighted  a bunch  of the  choice  ones  we just  want to  play  just a few  clips  from American  Idol  but the  problem is  if we're  going to  play Joe  we've got  to play  all of Joe  no  right  okay  that's fine  that's fine  Eric came in  and actually  told me that 
[01:05:00]  but by the time  I actually  picked up the  highlighter  to start  marking  things  he said  quick get  in there  with the  list  so you  want to  re-highlight  it takes  two things  I'll highlight  the entire  segment of the  person you  re-highlight  all right  you re-highlight  and we'll  just stall  here  re-highlight  and we'll  play some  American  Idol  audio  Tony from  Reno  hey  wow is there  a delay  on the phone  hey what's  wrong with  Norton  today man  it sounds  like he  had a bad 
[01:05:30]  delay last  night  no  well yeah  kind of  you know  I get to  these places  where I don't  sleep  I've been  sleeping for  three hours  a day  two hours  a day  and you know  just behaving  like a  chemical abuse  Norton  no no no  I don't do  any chemicals  at all  no no  I'm completely  sober since  February  I kind of  thought maybe  there was a  chemical problem  there when you  start going  off on  California  California  loves this  show very  much  when did I  go off on  California  when did I  go off on  California  listen to  your tape 
[01:06:00]  listen to your  tape  in fact  Opie even  said hey  you don't  want to  take on  California  wow  did I  what  did I  make fun  of LA  did I  trash LA  for show  no actually  you said  there's no  funny people  coming out  of here  did you  ever try  the comedy  shop  down in  Hollywood  no there's  no such  place  down there  sir there's  no such  place  as the  comedy  shop  dude  wait  I'll explain  oh my god  you have the  timing of a  stroke on  Christmas Eve  what I'm  saying is this  not that 
[01:06:30]  there's no  funny people  in LA  most of the  funny guys  who are in  LA come from  other places  because LA  I hope you  drop dead  no they go  there because  that is the  epicenter of  show business  but the fact  there's no  there's nothing  going on  that's good  down there  that you're  saying  I mean  when you  said you  wanted to  take on  California  I mean  heck I  may be not  the greatest  representative  on the  planet  but man  you sure  aren't the  greatest  representative  you know  sir  I hope  you're  honeymoon  in  Indonesia  you are  you just  keep  I'm trying 
[01:07:00]  to explain  to you  you turned  up fat  and bloated  too  but you're  already there  oh you're  very sharp  are you called  to defend  California  are you a  wannabe  in show  business  dude  is that  your problem  no not at  all  I'm just  an average  Joe  you're an  average  Joe  what kind  of an  ass  says that  you're an  average  Joe  are you  is that  what you  are  just a  regular  fella  exactly  hang up  again  another  faggot  coward  why  are the  listeners  if you're  going to  call up  and say  why do  you hang  up 
[01:07:30]  god almighty  I hate  air time  you can  say what  you want  because  they're  already  limited  tank  runs  out  of  gas  real  quick  hammering  idiot  how come  when Jimmy  is having  a little  bit of a  down day  these people  have to call  up and rag  him  because they  think they're  going to win  none of you  are going to  win  well Anthony  because I'm  a troublemaker  put them all  through  let them all  come through  was that a 
[01:08:00]  set up  well no  it's not a  set up  but I see  what's going  on on the  phones  good let  him call  let's rile  up Jimmy  let him  call  I hope  you cancel  your XM  subscription  wow  you don't  want that  I don't  care  let him  let him  let him  hey hey  hey Jimmy  that's a little  harsh  alright then  pass it on  to someone  keep paying  the bill  but pass it  on to someone  let me amend  that  alright  American Idol  Anthony  yes  I watched it  last night  I liked  what did it  start out with  those three  blonde chicks 
[01:08:30]  all the triplets  did you see  that  you know what  I did not  three blonde chicks  come up  they're triplets  and they're  dressed in their  party dresses  whatever the hell  they were wearing  and Simon just  tells them right out  you know  you're all  overweight  and they're like  oh well  we know  kind of acknowledged  it trying to diffuse  it but you could  tell they were  pretty embarrassed  I don't understand  though why  when  like you get  like three white  chicks come out  and they're  overweight  and Simon 
[01:09:00]  jumps on them  says something  about it  but then if  like a black  chick comes out  and she's  really big  they don't say  anything about  her weight  like it's kind  of an Aretha  thing you know  like that's fine  because Aretha's  fat  no it's because  Simon  Jim brought it up  yesterday  he's a wimp  when it comes  down to it  yeah  he really is  he goes after  the easy targets  yeah  most of them  are easy targets  obviously  but  yeah why  isn't he  telling the  big fat  black chick  she's fat  how about  Reuben Stoddard  he's not exactly 
[01:09:30]  smelt  yeah exactly  he made it  all the way  through  and actually  won  yeah  see Anthony  like Simon  I hate  I've hated him  since day one  I hate  I just like it  because he's  blatantly honest  with these people  yeah but he's  also predictable  but it's  predictability  like if someone  sucks  and comes up  and stinks  sometimes you'll  have  what's his name  there Randy  say  well I'm kind  of on the fence  and you know  it's a no  you know it's a no  and then they go  to Simon  and he just goes  no  absolutely not 
[01:10:00]  but I think  he plays his role  because everyone  is expecting him  to just hate  everybody  but he doesn't  and then he tells  people that  they're very good  that they're very good  and then he's  over the top  at times  where you're like  alright  relax  calm down  I don't know  I'm not buying it  is what I'm saying  really  yeah I think  you know  he was a very  honest guy  when this whole  thing started  but now  with all the  press  and he goes  on Regis  and everyone's  like oh Simon  now he's really  playing up to  what he has  become 
[01:10:30]  in my opinion  I just see it  as it is  if someone walks  up there  and they stink  on ice  he just says  you know  no you're awful  you have no  business  pursuing music  yeah  blatantly honest  yeah I don't  mind that  it's just  like but again  he'll attack  certain people  not the other  he'll attack  differently  that's what  irritates me  soft targets  alright  I guess we got  some audio  of Justin  Justin Smith  which one was he  Justin  Steve wrote 
[01:11:00]  very gay  oh really  so I don't know  a lot of the guys  come just  sauntering into  that audition  hall  and you could just  before they say a word  you're like oh boy  here he is  oh boy  and then they're like  hi  hi Simon  I hope you like  me  alright let's  take a listen  to Justin  well I found a good  job in the city  working for the men  every night and day  and I haven't lost 
[01:11:30]  one minute  to see  I was worrying  about things  you might have been  a big wheel  keep on turning  a primary  keep on burning  and we rolling  rolling  rolling on the river  and we rolling  rolling  rolling on the river  what is it 
[01:12:00]  with this song  yeah a lot of people  were doing that  hearing that  I really want  Ike Turner  to rape him  on a console  a lot of people  were doing it  to the rolling  on the river  and they were  just awful  here's a little more  I don't know  I just love to dance  and I just  picked the sound  that came to mind  everyone keeps  choosing that  bloody soul  okay  last a good job  in the city 
[01:12:30]  working for the men  every night and day  never lost  in the  oh I'm sorry  sorry  Ike Turner  should punch you  in the face  never did I lose  one minute of sleep  cause I was worried  about the way  things might have been  beating with Tina  oh I'll never keep on  burning  and we're rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling 
[01:13:00]  rolling  on the river  rolling  on the river  yuck  do but  she's  rolling  rolling  rolling  rolling  I don't like music anymore.  Hey, that's funny.  You're just kind of sitting there just disgusted.  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap for hours on end. 
[01:13:30]  But see, wrong.  Fine.  They're not disgusted, and they're not sitting there for hours on end.  The TV show makes it look like they're seeing every single person.  No, no, I know that.  They've got all their minions out there going, okay, you find the really good singers, you find the really bad singers, and bring them to us.  And we'll tape a few hours here and there, and that's it.  I mean, it's set up where it looks like these people are lined up for miles, and they're just sitting there for days on end. 
[01:14:00]  Every one of them.  I guarantee they taped maybe 20, 30 hours, maybe.  Tops.  And that's over a couple-week period.  All the work's being done by the producers.  Like, it's no surprise when someone is singing really awful.  That's a setup by the producers.  Yeah, they know.  Today we're going to be taping all the really awful singers.  So they're prepared.  They know exactly who's going through that door.  Yeah, they know.  There's no surprises when they walk in there. 
[01:14:30]  They tell them, you know, all right, here's a bad one.  All right, this chick's really good.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, here's the last thing about Justin.  I'm going to come in with my personality that I have, and I'm going out doing my best that I can, trying to succeed.  Get Jimmy Hits food.  And hopefully it never fails me yet, so I'm going to come out and win this.  What does succeed mean?  He's leaving the union?  Made sense to me.  He's going to succeed.  He's succeeding.  No.  All right, let's do that.  They are so confident.  I love the confidence, the overconfidence when they leave that audition studio after they've been told they stink, 
[01:15:00]  and they start talking to the camera about how they're going to move on.  And, no, don't worry, you'll see me again.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Half these people that they're showing on TV anyway, they don't even prepare for their, quote, audition.  Looks like they're just winging it.  If you know you're going to be on American Idol, wouldn't you spend a lot of time practicing your craft?  A lot of them are crazy.  It's like crazy people.  Yeah.  Real, live, crazy people. 
[01:15:30]  I agree with you on that.  Let's say hi to Sean in Jersey.  Sean?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Sprinkle Nips.  Hi, how are you?  I'm good.  The best thing about last night was that overconfident piece of shit that had, he was like a cruise ship singer.  Oh, man, yeah.  With the fake teeth and the fake tan.  And he comes with a whole entourage of his family with posters and banners saying, go, go, go.  Yeah, his name was Joe.  He brought his whole family, his friends.  They had a banner that said, go, Joe, go.  Oh, he had a whole entourage with him.  And he thought he had, like, the looks, the million-dollar smile. 
[01:16:00]  He's been in the business.  I'm the package.  He goes, I am the package.  Yeah, I'm the package.  Comes in all overconfident.  And he was mediocre at best.  And, you know, they let him know it.  Do we have him?  I think so.  He was really bothered.  I've got sunshine on a cloudy day.  When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May.  The whole smiling as he's singing.  Well, I guess you'd say, what can make me feel this way? 
[01:16:30]  My girl, talking about my girl.  My girl, I've got so much, honey.  The bees and the me.  Okay.  He's not awful.  No, no.  He's just there.  And his look and attitude actually hurt him, I think.  Like, he thought he had the whole package.  And I think it hurt him.  I think his voice was probably good enough to squeak through to the next round. 
[01:17:00]  You know, if he had a different look and his attitude was a little better.  But he was so cocky coming in there that I think they were like, you know something?  No, not good enough for your cockiness.  What did you think?  I thought it reminded me of one of those terrible entertainment shows you'd have in the 1970s  where somebody would do a dance, a joke, and then end the act with a song, 
[01:17:30]  which is exactly what you are, which is a cruise ship singer.  I am not a cruise ship singer.  He wasn't that bad.  You know what?  I'm sorry.  I am not a cruise ship singer.  I've only done one.  And they made me sing Broadway stuff.  And I came in here and gave you my heart and soul.  And I will sing something else.  So does everyone.  I don't think so.  I thoroughly disagree with you.  And I'll tell you why.  Because the people that have gone through these past years have been able to do one thing,  particularly last year.  And I know that I can sing more than one genre.  I have the story.  I look the part.  You need to let me sing something else. 
[01:18:00]  And you need to put me through.  I promise you.  What's that look for?  You and I are going to have a problem if you carry on like this.  Why are you saying?  Because you are becoming obnoxious.  I don't want to be obnoxious.  I don't think this is what we're looking for.  What are you looking for?  Not you.  So you're not going to even try and give me a chance?  I just want to get on the show.  Come on.  You're on the show, but you didn't make it.  Okay.  Not good enough.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See, his attitude was really like not... 
[01:18:30]  You got to kiss their ass a little bit.  He was selling himself pretty good, though.  I don't know.  He was selling himself like he was the thing.  And, you know, he was mediocre.  A guy like that you want to see get smashed because he's a bull.  Right.  Yeah.  I did.  I wanted to see him just fail.  A toothy fool.  America was watching going, oh, just fail.  Just fail.  A little bit more from Joe.  Your name is?  My name's Joe.  Shane.  And why are you here? 
[01:19:00]  I'm here because I believe I'm really talented, and I think I have the whole package, and I'm ready to sing for you.  What do you do for a living?  Oh, my gosh.  What haven't I done?  That's a good answer for that.  Let's see.  I've been a television news reporter in a small station in Texas.  Go K-10.  Yeah.  I sang on a cruise ship.  Now, I train people to go out on cruise ships, but probably not anymore.  You're a professional, then.  You're a professional.  I like that.  Well, a little bit.  I don't do any of it anymore. 
[01:19:30]  I just get everybody ready to go.  Good.  Off you go.  He was all smiling, and that lady die laughing, nervous laughing at everything.  It was just awful.  There's nothing worse than somebody trying to put on phony charm.  Yep.  Gosh, what haven't I done?  Gosh, what haven't I done?  Phony charm.  You got a Mouseketeer, stupid.  That's awful.  Yeah, let's say hi to Juliana.  Hi.  How you been?  Hey.  Hi.  Hello.  No, the simple fact is this guy might be able to find four other guys to get together 
[01:20:00]  and put together a nice little shitty boy band, like, you know, the Backstreet Boys or something.  Yeah, that's what he can do.  He was awful.  It was awful.  It's just an obnoxious, like, and as he was singing, you obviously can't tell from just  the audio, but as he's singing, and like we said, his voice isn't bad, but as he's singing,  he had that big fake smile on, and he's doing, like, hand movements and looking right at the judges, like, with that dopey smile. 
[01:20:30]  And I'm sure that just bugged him.  Yeah.  That's why they threw him out of there.  And when they turn around as they're walking out and take that last look at the judges, like, hoping that they're going to go,  No, we're kidding.  Come back.  It never happens.  It just ain't, it never happens, yeah.  All right, Anthony, I think this is where I got bored.  What's the story of Adam and Dirk?  Adam and Dirk.  Two total dorks.  Yeah.  Complete dorks. 
[01:21:00]  One of them was fat.  The other one was kind of fat, too, but, you know, glasses, bad, like, retard teeth, retard hair, all greasy, unshowered.  I think the thing to do this year is to try to be the next William Hung, right?  Well, a couple of them are trying that move, yeah.  But they sparked up this close friendship during the audition process,  and they were being portrayed as, like, gay lovers by American Idol.  That's pretty funny. 
[01:21:30]  They just kept showing them touching each other and patting each other on the back and consoling each other and doing,  they tried to do some jive handshake and they couldn't even do it right.  They're missing with their hands, like, complete beat-them-up-in-the-hallway dorks.  Who's this, Scotty and Dirk?  Scotty and Dirk.  Yeah.  All right, well, here's audio of them meeting.  I just met Dirk on, I believe, Monday, and he's a really good guy, and I think he's going to make it, 
[01:22:00]  and I think it'd be really cool if I was at the finale with him.  I am the next American Idol because I can appeal to America.  I can appeal to the audience, and I'm a really good singer.  I have really one of the coolest personalities you'll ever meet.  If you ever find out about Adam, you'll always find out that, you know, Adam's a really cool person to be with.  Yeah, I had to agree with Adam.  He is a totally cool guy.  I met him on Monday, and, you know, I'm known as the comedian, and I like putting smiles on people's faces,  and he's one of the people I like putting smiles on.  He's going to be playing in Gotham tonight, by the way. 
[01:22:30]  I think the judges will see an awesome performance by me.  You know, I have the little voice going, a little hand movement, and maybe a little movement also with my legs.  My friends say, Dirk, you're doing a great job. Keep it up. Good luck. Don't get too nervous. Concentrate hard, and don't be the next William Hung.  It's a little rough.  Yeah, these two were really bad.  All right, well, let's see how bad they...  Can I kiss you? 
[01:23:00]  They are.  This is Dirk singing.  Like a stupid tossed out of the ocean. We get caught up swimming in the motion. Hearts were sailing. Lovers on the right track. Got out so far that they can't, we, we can't get back. You got to reach out. Take hold of my hand. You got to reach out till you're safe on the land.  I think this kid was retarded, by the way.  You got to hold on, baby, never give up. You got to reach out for when you're caught in the current of love. 
[01:23:30]  Okay, man.  Is that the Baywatch theme?  He's singing the David Hasselhoff song. It was David Hasselhoff made it famous, I guess, in Germany, where he's so huge.  All right.  And the kid was a big David Hasselhoff fan. And like I said, I think he was retarded.  Was that a goofy thing to put on?  No, the kid has a little wrong in the head.  They are exploiting so many mentally disturbed people on this show. 
[01:24:00]  And for some reason that, oh, is this it?  Yeah.  This is just as bad.  This guy's retarded, too, by the way.  Exactly.  Think of those stupid Nazis enjoy this.  Oh, they love it.  Awful country.  All right, let's go to Mike from Brooklyn. Mike.  He actually had a song called The Night Rider, where he'd come out on stage on top of a black kit car in his black leather and start singing. 
[01:24:30]  And the Nazis are just going crazy for him.  Going nuts.  They really are easily immune.  Oh, completely.  All right, go ahead, Mike.  Yes, sir.  How about that?  That's all right.  Didn't Dirk look just like Private Pyle from Full Metal Jack?  He did.  Big fat head.  He did.  He looked like Private Pyle.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Very good.  Good call.  I bet he didn't end his American Idol session the same way.  Here's some Dirk comments.  Okay.  Yo, man.  I want to ask you a question and look me in the eyes.  Was that a serious audition? 
[01:25:00]  I put 100% in everything I do, Simon.  Nobody chooses that song seriously to sing on American Idol.  Come on.  He actually sounded almost as good as David Hasselhoff.  Thank you, Randy.  All right, yeah.  And he said thank you like it was a compliment.  Thank you.  Yeah, they're really exploiting the mentally disturbed people on this show.  But there's no outcry about it.  People are entertained.  Once again, as the producers of the show, they're like, this whole William Hunk thing  took off last year, so let's exploit that.  Trying to make another one. 
[01:25:30]  Let's throw a bunch of William Hunk potentials out there.  The audience will eat it up, and then we'll eventually get to the actual show.  No one's not William Hunk.  I'm finding someone with talent.  Because obviously these people have no talent.  And the first couple seasons of the show, this was only a small part of the show, remember?  Yeah, they really went.  Here's all the real bad auditions.  There's a quick montage.  There's bye, but they're really focusing on this early on in the show this year.  Yeah.  Here's his buddy, Adam.  Adam Pratt, come on in, man.  Hey, guys.  What's going down, Doc? 
[01:26:00]  What's up, baby?  What's going down?  Would you stand up here right on the tee, man?  20 years old from Hoffman Estates.  I just turned 21 Tuesday.  Oh, congrats.  And I have had the best 21st birthday ever.  You did?  I did the best Simon Cowell impression.  I'll do it.  That was absolutely the worst performance ever.  There's nothing special about you at all.  Simon, what do you say, man?  Oh, wonderful.  It actually wasn't that bad.  Wonderful.  It was done in his own voice, though, with, like, a Simon Cowell inflection on the voice. 
[01:26:30]  Pretty much just used his own retarded voice.  I like impressions.  Like, I think maybe Nathaniel and Danny should do an impression of Noah, put on some suits  and get to work.  Here's Adam singing Richard Marks.  What are you going to sing?  This I Promise You by Richard Marks, but performed by NSYNC.  Okay, go for it.  What?  When the visions around you brings tears to your eyes 
[01:27:00]  And all that surrounds you  Are secrets and lies  I'll be your strength  I'll give you hope  Keeping your faith when it's gone  The one you should call  Was standing here all along  Wow, hopes and dreams loaded into the car crusher  Here we go  Dog, man, I'm sorry 
[01:27:30]  They were laughing at him, yeah  Simon, what do you think?  Tell me, Adam, just in case I'm losing the plot here  Why would America watch if you're on American Idol?  Because of my singing ability, I  No, really  Seriously  Seriously  Come on  Can I do another song?  No  No  So  Do I finish the song or 
[01:28:00]  No  Wow, he really believes he has  He thought  When they showed him before he went in  He thought he was going to be the next American Idol  These people go in there  With their little dreams  And you know, like, as he's sleeping at night  He's rolling the fantasies in his head  Playing it out  And our winner is  You know, and they're hearing their name being blurted out  Playing it over and over in their heads again  What is it going to be like when I'm in, like, the fifth round? 
[01:28:30]  And what kind of little video vignettes are they going to put me through?  And just, like, making the whole fantasy play out  Right to the end of the show and beyond  In his head  And where does it end?  One half of a song in front of the judges  And you're crushed  And now  Done  Adam and Dirk have to say goodbye  Yeah, and again, played it up really homo  Their moment of fame is over 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  And they played the sappy music  They're the gayest song ever  As these two said goodbye to each other  They met during the audition process  AIDS benefits song, right?  They really thought I was good, but  I guess if it's too good to be true, it probably is  I tried  And  I have no regrets  And  I don't  I don't know what to say or do now  Even though I didn't make it, we'll still definitely be friends  We'll still  We'll still be friends  All right, thanks a lot 
[01:29:30]  I hate that corny applause  Because he went up there and tried  Gave it his all  Gave it his all  They show the door  And then the door opens up  And of course the loser walks out  And now the people are eagerly awaiting the results  Right  And they kind of throw their arms up in the air  And do that little  Little Paul from Munaki face  Or Pat from Munaki  Paul  Pat from Munaki  Pat from Munaki face  Kind of  I tried  I gave it a shot  And then  Everyone out  And everyone out  It feels like they have to applaud 
[01:30:00]  Because they gave  They didn't  They weren't even supposed to be  Well, I tried  What are you going to do?  They weren't even supposed to be in the game  They weren't even supposed to be in the game  His big straight arms  A little face  Trying to be charming  Fat Colonel Kurtz face  Like a fire and egg at it  A face that's only entertaining when vomit's coming out of it  Exactly  Did you say vomit? 
[01:30:30]  There he is  Oh, I'm vomiting  There he is  The winner of the eggnog drinking contest  Eggnog pouring out of that fat skull  My fight  It's your fight  It's your fight  It's my fight  Well, whatever  It's our fight  It's all our fight  I'm from Munaki  Appley-cheeked ass  I do like him, though 
[01:31:00]  I don't want to like him  But I don't like him  Don't Munaki it  The funniest part was when he had like 40 car crashes in a row  And he couldn't hear because he'd have headphones on  Yeah, and he just kept trying  And I would look at him  And then I would just look over an ant's finger  And I would just see it go  And I knew  There's another  Crash me again  Dolt  Lonely diabetic  Jesus 
[01:31:30]  He's a faithful listener of the program  I like him very much  But he's diabetic  And he did 50 double shots of eggnog  Nut  We should have cut his legs off on principle  Shoved him down the elevator shaft  What do you guys think of that stupid applause  Because, you know, they went up there  It's useless  It's more people just patronizing people  Yeah, that's exactly what it is  You're going to see your friend in a comedy club  You're just all clapping 
[01:32:00]  And they're like, hey, did good  I mean, they weren't  You're funny  They weren't supposed to be in the game to begin with  You know, it's kind of like the New York City Marathon  These people walk the whole thing  Anyone can walk 26 miles  And they walk the whole thing  I don't know how long it is  And they get, you know, this just amazing applause  As they, you know, cross the finish line  I don't get it  Bravery and courage  Where's the bravery?  There is none  Alright, let's say hi to Steve on Long Island  We're just about done with this, by the way  Steve, what's up? 
[01:32:30]  Hey, Steve  Steve?  Oh, he's got a cell phone  He's got one of those  Crap it out  He wants to talk about the teenage Michael Jackson kid  Or chick, or whatever it was  Another annoying, overconfident  This little chick who looks like a little boy  Comes running into the audition studio  Singing some Michael Jackson crap  With a Michael Jackson hat  Michael Jackson moves  Trying the Michael Jackson voice 
[01:33:00]  And, you know, everybody's supposed to be impressed by this  She seemed pretty talented  Eh, like a Michael Jackson cover act  Talented, you know?  It's like, eh  One-trick pony kind of thing  Yeah  Alright, here's the clip  It's, uh, I think it's Jeremy  She's going to Hollywood  Angel's going to Hollywood  And I'm next  I'm going with her  No  I'm going with her  And we're going to have some  Which one is that?  That's the music student  Oh, okay  Yeah  Did Steve misnumber those? 
[01:33:30]  No  It might be this one  Let's try this one  Alright  This might be the 16-year-old chick  That wants to be Michael Jackson  I'm going to give you my own  Until I fall  I ain't breaking the law  And my music is alive  And I die for the cause  You can already see  That the haters lost  Gotta pay to be the boss now  Now I'm spitting out my thoughts now  It's a new generation  Why we got to live in a day  To the hatred  I don't know about you  But I've been patient  We didn't mean the slaves  In a vacant place  All because of the colour  Of a melancholy face  Hello  You and I 
[01:34:00]  Must make a pact  We must bring  Salvation back  Where there is love  I'll be there  I'll be there  Alright  Alright  Alright  Alright  That sounded like a fidget  I'll be there  So they didn't know  What to do with this chick  No 
[01:34:30]  I thought it was a dude  But it's a chick  Shouldn't have made it through  Doesn't have the look  It's like  It looked like a little boy  I keep saying he too  Because there was nothing  Girl-like about it  And the voice  Is this chipmunk-like  Michael Jackson impression  Didn't work  And Simon again  Is being honest  And the other two  Are you know  I see some talent there  No you don't  Paul Abdul had to lie  All those years  And that awful marriage  No it's a good movie 
[01:35:00]  You sound like  You know when you put helium  From a balloon  And you swallow it  That's honestly  What you sound like  Like the chipmunks almost  Yeah but I mean  It's extraordinary  Thank you  She's unique  It's different  I like her  Definitely unique  I mean you got talent  I mean you're definitely  A great entertainer  And all that  I actually loved  What you walked in here  Doing more than  I love that  See that's my originality  Randy yes or no  Randy yes or no  Yes

[01:36:00]  There's no versatility there  Once they start doing the show  They try to throw in  You know you got to do  Like country song  And then you have to do  A rock type thing  Or a pop thing  And then you got to do  Broadway  I'm starting to think  You're an expert  At this program  I am an absolute expert  I'm starting to think  You're obsessed with  This American Idol  I've watched every single  Show of every season  This was supposed to be  A little goof segment  On our show  But you're like  I have watched every show  You've got the ins and outs  Of this damn  Of every season  This show  I'll be being in the 
[01:36:30]  Music business  Before I got into radio  The music biz  As lead singer  Of the hit pop band  Rotgut  I know  You guys were huge  In Yugoslavia  I think  We were big  Yes very big  In Yugoslavia  I believe we had  A release there  Yeah  And some parts of  Some corners of  Toronto  I never got that  About music  A band that just  Absolutely stinks  In the states  Is like huge  In some obscure  Obscure little city 
[01:37:00]  In Japan  Or something  Dude we're huge  In Vienna  How many times  Have you heard  Local bands  From Long Island  Were like  Hey man  We're going on  Another Japanese tour  Going to Japan  I'm like what  You can't even  Sell out  My father's place  Yeah  Yeah they couldn't  Sell out  A dive dump club  Out on Long Island  But they're huge  In Japan  For some reason  But Japan  They flock  They flock  They love it over there  It's amazing  Blue jeans  Alright here's  So then they picked  This Michael Jackson  Wannabe  And  It was awful 
[01:37:30]  By the way  Awful  And  The mom  Just goes  Off  Thank you guys  Thank you guys  Cat  Cat  This  This is AC  Baby  Simon was an  I'm going to say it  I'm going to say it  On camera  But Randy  And Paula  Knew  That I had  Something unique  About myself  And I'm going  To Hollywood  I'm going to Hollywood  But her mom  Had some  And obviously  Modesty runs  In the family  She's going  Straight to the top 
[01:38:00]  And I guarantee  She's going to make it  To be the next  American Idol  And sell more records  Than any other  American Idol  That you've had  In the history  Worldwide  Believe that  Oh man  I can't wait  To watch  Her get booted  Now I can't wait  Now I see the  Mother's disappointment  Yeah  That big  Shirley Hempel  Looking mother  That came trotting out  Looked like she  Eight star Jones  Big fat mother  Comes out there  Just hoping  Now the fantasies 
[01:38:30]  Are playing out  In her head  I'm going to get  My hearted  I'm going to have  A limousine  Bling bling  Awesome bling  She's picturing  It all now  Ice  Yeah  And plenty of paper  Next round  Bye bye  I guarantee  That one will be  Off next round  I'm an expert  On the show  Now I get a watch  I'm not happy  About this  She'll be gone  I don't know  When the audition  Process ends  And they start  That next round  But in Hollywood  Where was that  Audition stuff  That was  St. Louis 
[01:39:00]  St. Louis  St. Louis  St. Louis  St. Louis  Missouri  Alright finally  And then we'll  Move on here  Is there one  Good one you have  I want to hear  One good one  Yeah one that  Could actually sing  Like I've heard  Ruben sing  Like since he's won  I mean he obviously  Honestly  He's really good  I mean  They had this  Hot piece of ass  She's a farmer  That helps her father  Like he raises cows  Or whatever  And she has to milk  The cows and stuff  Farmer's daughter  Farmer's daughter  Blonde  You just know  What evilness  Happens on that farm  A little  She's probably  Eating a little  Too much dairy  So she's a little  A little chubby 
[01:39:30]  But they'll  Get her on a treadmill  And get her in shape  And so she walks out  I think it's going to be  Just a disaster  Because she's from  The middle of nowhere  And all of a sudden  She had like a voice  Of an angel  She was really good  I hear she's going to  Bring her critters with her  When she goes to Hollywood  Can I take my critters with me  What the hell is a critter  Do you have her  Steve's running together  Uncle Jed  She's going to be  An American Idol  Thanks Jimmy  For extending this  Wonderful segment  I mean we hear a lot  Of the bad ones

[01:46:30]  Like making little breasts  With his big fat chubby hands  You know  He's like watching  A morph of Ben  And the Three Stooges  Awful noises  And twi-  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  Shep was doing coke  With Tom Brady  Why always Tom Brady  Cause he's the hero  Of Boston 
[01:47:00]  I understand  I understand  Dude  Lawyer Malloy  Tried to get into  One of my father's restaurants  He wouldn't even let him in  Cause  Dude  Spread out  Yeah  What was the one from earlier  Cause people are just  Tuning in man  They're trying to get these  Four Chinese nationalists  They're looking for the  Dirty bomb  And Ben  Ben's dumb drunk friends  Are out looking for him  If he thinks that's news  Four Alkies  Four Mick Alkies  From Salvi  Drunk driving around  Boston killing innocent people  Looking for the terrorists 
[01:47:30]  Looking for Ford delivery men  Zully I think I saw him  Ben was dead serious though  He's like  My friends are drunk  And they're out looking  For the terrorists  They're out looking for him  He's like  They better hope the police  Find him first  They better hope the police  Find him first  Because if some of my friends  Find him  They're dead  Right now the crack terror  Hunting squad is vomiting  Behind a Denny's somewhere  You and your idiot friends  Have to upchuck 
[01:48:00]  By the dumpster  Turn your Boston Red Sox hat  Backwards so you don't  Get any on the bill  Oh that's hilarious  Bunch of asses  Bunch of terrorists  Great  Don't they catch him  They're not going to do anything  But hide  What are they going to do  Don't  Sitting there ordering  Chinese food  Looking at every delivery guy  I think that's him dude  I think that's him dude  If they saw all four of them  They'd probably ask for  Mustard and duck sauce  To take their cowardly 
[01:48:30]  White selves  Back to their nice  Large homes  Ben's friends stink  Screw it  Let's go to the vineyard  Don't  Don't  It's my favorite thing  On the show  I don't know why  There's a little gossip  Love that gossipy little unkempt head  But he always has something  It's amazing  It all goes back to Boston  He knows everything about Boston  But it all goes back to Boston  This guy is tied into Boston 
[01:49:00]  And I wish people could see  What you see  What we could see  Is when you look through our glass  You see all through the office  All the dead weight  All the dead weight  And then you just see the glass  For our inner office  Where we go  Which is like 35 feet away  Yeah  And just Ben's big  Misshapen  Messy haired head  Facing away  Into a computer monitor  Hurking and jerking  Like crazy  Yeah  Occasionally just going left  For no reason  Coming back  I'd hate to sit behind him  In a movie theater 
[01:49:30]  He's just getting the latest  Boston gossip  That's all  He's not producing the radio show  He's just getting the latest  Boston gossip  And he doesn't read articles  He just clicks on them  And he zips  And he highlights them  With blue  And then goes to the next one  And then goes to the next one  Highlights it  All the time  Looking like the office  Is a train  And his head is just  Bobbing back and forth  On it  He is well connected  Though man  He does know a lot of things  Every party  He knows  He can get in  Everywhere  Half the stuff that ends up 
[01:50:00]  In the gossip columns  In the post and stuff  He already knew  He tells us like  The weeks  You know not weeks  Whatever  Days  Oh yeah  And the section in the paper  Where it goes  We hear that some  Famous person  Yeah the blind box  Was out last night  With you know  Because they can't  Mention the name  Or else they might get sued  To Ben  That's like  People that sit there  And do like the crypto quote  Or crossword puzzle  To Ben just opens it up  And goes  Oh I know who that is  That that that  Yeah most people will guess  Like oh  He doesn't guess  He knows 
[01:50:30]  Oh that's Ben Affleck  I know who that is  That's Ben Affleck  Ben Affleck  My friend told me  Yeah  When he was hunting  That terrorist Chinese  Alright you want an example  He pops up through a hole  In the ground  And Bill Murray hunts him  And tries to blow him up  Ben's sitting down  Getting a shoe shine  And the shoe shine guy  Going  Psst Ben  I got some inside info  Word on the street  Ah thanks dude  Well you want an example  Of one of these people  That audition  That's good 
[01:51:00]  I guess this is the farmer  The farmer's daughter  That's really hot  That we were talking about  It's Carrie Underwood  Life on the farm  Is pretty simple  Whenever my dad  Needs help in the mornings  I'll get up real early  And help him go feed the cows  Or put out hay  Or I've never gotten  To experience a lot of things  That a lot of other people have  I've never gotten  To travel far at all  Never flown at all  I want to go to Hollywood  Really bad  So now I'm thinking  I did see this part  I'm thinking  Wow this girl's really hot  She's from a little farm  In the middle of nowhere  Like we said  A little chubby whatever 
[01:51:30]  But not too bad right  Not even close to being  Oh no no no  Chubby  You can just tell  She needs to be toned up a little  Just being very picky  Obviously  If she's trying to  Maybe become the next  Jessica Simpson  Perhaps her mom  Can call her up  And say  Ah you know  There's a gym downstairs  Maybe  You can work out  A little bit  So then  Wow  Meet some nice people  Replace cows with steers  So I'm thinking  As I'm watching this  Oh man  This is a set up  This girl's going to be  Absolutely awful 
[01:52:00]  Hot piece of ass  From the middle of nowhere  I mean  How could she possibly  Learn how to sing well  You know  Right  She's too busy on the farm  And this is her singing  Lay down with me  Tell me no lies  Just hold me close  Don't patronize  Don't patronize  Don't patronize 
[01:52:30]  Cause I can't make you love me  If you don't  She sings this to daddy  You can't make your heart feel  Something that it won't  Here in the dark  Okay, that was very good.  Yeah.  Very good, Carrie.  Thank you.  Very good.  Thank you.  Yeah, great.  Yeah, even Simon went right forward.  Wow, very good.  Now, definitely not my cup of tea, you know, 
[01:53:00]  but I could tell that that's what they're looking for.  Dude, you're taking the show a little too seriously.  I don't, I'm not.  You sit home with your popcorn and...  Oh, yes.  And yell at the TV.  I yell at the TV.  I do.  Do you have a little score sheet that you...  Little score sheet I jot down.  I take notes on each contestant  and I see how it turns out later.  No, I don't.  Did you find the booger?  No, I didn't.  And we are...  Who wiped the booger on your couch?  I was online.  I was online yesterday looking at furniture. 
[01:53:30]  That's one booger.  I'm getting a new couch.  That's one.  I can't get past it.  That's one booger.  Um, my girlfriend's, uh, sister's, um, son.  How old is he?  Were you here yesterday?  Seven.  I didn't hear that part, but I...  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy wasn't here.  Oh, you were late.  Oh, yeah.  I missed that at the very beginning.  Oh, my God.  It was hilarious.  He's going to throw a couch away because...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  Our house guests that were there for a couple of days, they're gone now.  Um, the, the son, uh, was with the father and everybody else was out shopping. 
[01:54:00]  I was, I was home, so we decided to watch a movie.  Sat on our, our couch.  My, my big, you know, modular couch.  And, um, the kid, uh, uh, was, was doing something with his hands.  His father saw him and said, what are you doing?  And, and, and he goes, picking my nose.  And he goes, and then I hear the father go, did, did you just wipe a booger on Anthony's  couch?  And the kid goes, yep.  And he goes, well, find it.  And now the kid's looking around and he goes, I can't, I can't. 
[01:54:30]  So now I'm like, and I'm just sitting there in shock.  I'm just like, oh my God, I'm in shock.  And, uh, I'm not looking for it.  So as far as I'm concerned, it's still in there.  It could stay in there.  I have a lovely big couch in front of my huge big screen television.  And me and my girlfriend sat on opposite sides of the room on our computer chairs last night  watching television because I will not now sit on the, the booger couch. 
[01:55:00]  You'll find it.  What you'll do is you'll doze off on the couch and you'll have, you'll taste a little salty  treat.  You know, he hates this.  You know me with snot.  Snot is probably the worst, aside from, you know, crap, snot is probably the worst bodily  fluid that could come out of a person's body to me as far as I'm concerned.  He'll fall asleep on the couch and wake up and he'll think that he has a raisin stuck  to the side of his face.  Or a De Niro mole.  He'll do the raging bull impressions and then eat it and go, wait a minute. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, stop it.  Yeah.  So we sat in our respective computer chairs because the booger couch now has got to go.  The couch has got to go.  The kid may not have even wiped it on the couch.  He may have had nothing on his finger and just said that to his dad.  There really may be nothing there.  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  There may be nothing there.  The couch has got to go.  Can't he just clean it?  No.  Clean the upholstery?  Couch has got to go. 
[01:56:00]  I cannot get this clean.  He's not kidding.  It is there.  It has been booger-fied.  Yeah, taste that delicious booger flavor.  Yeah, I cannot now sit on booger couch.  Really?  What are you doing?  I had a booger, actually.  You're picking your nose and where are you?  Stop it.  Don't even...  Jesus Christ.  What did you just do?  Oh, wow.  Did you just put that in your mouth?  Yes, he did.  That bothered me, too.  Look.  Wow. 
[01:56:30]  It's weird.  It's got like a salty, odd flavor and there's a hair in it.  I cannot understand you people.  What?  I cannot understand you people that do that.  I won't know you're a little faster with my food.  You've never eaten a booger.  Never in my life.  Never?  Have I...  It's like saying you've never eaten a log out of your pants.  Dude, we could...  Yeah, I would question that.  Dude, we could take a survey right now and I guarantee 90% of the audience has eaten  a booger.  Within the last 10 minutes.  90%? 
[01:57:00]  Guarantee.  No audience?  Yeah.  No effing way in the world.  I'm not saying on a regular basis, but I guarantee...  No.  You're not going to find many people that have not.  No.  Take a survey right now.  Take a survey in this room.  Jim?  Of course.  Raise your hand, and you interns and suited fellows also, who has shoved boogers in their  mouth and eaten them?  Everyone's raised their hands.  Raise your hand.  One, two in that room.  Most of them are raised their hands.  Two in that room.  How many here?  One.  Two in this room.  Nagel, never?  Nope. 
[01:57:30]  Four out of...  Big Kev?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Of course you have.  Disgusting.  Almost all the guys have...  Put your hand up, Steve.  Steve.  Of course Steve has.  Yeah.  It was a sweet booger.  Very sweet.  Very cozy.  Out of his cozy face.  Back to the audio.  So, here's the comments about Carrie, the farm girl.  Who's your favorite singer?  Who do you love?  Actually, Martina McBride.  Yeah, I could hear a little bit of that.  Yeah, very good.  I was saying to someone the other day, I'm surprised that we haven't found a good country 
[01:58:00]  singer in this competition yet.  I think you're very good.  Thank you.  I think you should stay good at what you're doing as well.  Randy?  I think you're excellent, too.  I would work a little bit more on the emotion and the stage presence, just a little bit,  because you've got it vocally.  I mean, you can do your thing.  You work it out.  Right off the farm, you know?  Definitely.  Paula?  Yes?  Carrie, you're through to the next round.  Welcome to Hollywood, girl.  Well done.  Yeah, girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's going.  She's going far, I believe.  I have her picked on my little list at home.  I'll bet you she sings even better with her face in a pillow and whiskey being breathed 
[01:58:30]  into her face from the side.  Getting a rash on her neck from whiskers that haven't been shaved in a couple of days.  Maybe one of dad's friends who helps around the farm.  Sing it, sing it, sing it again, sweetheart.  Sing it.  I can make you love me.  With that rough whiskery scratch. 
[01:59:00]  Where she sings ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch to the Rudolph the Red-Nosed  Reindeer thing.  Oh, I don't have that anymore, unfortunately.  Awful.  All right, so.  Oh, you got it somewhere?  It doesn't matter.  The moment's passed.  What's the, uh...  We got someone from opianthony.net checking in on the instant feedback.  Another fine message board.  And, uh...  Oh. 
[01:59:30]  I didn't know who that was.  I thought it was just a fan, but it's Donnie Doight.  Donnie Doight.  She's waving at me.  I'm like, how do I know this guy?  I'm like, well, maybe because he interviewed you on TV two days ago, you idiot.  Is that him right there?  Yeah, well, he's out of his, uh...  He's out of his interview clothes, so I didn't recognize him.  Very handsome.  Well, we'll get him in here next.  Uh, yeah, so he writes,  Dudes, Ashley Simpson is exactly like all the rejects from American Idol.  Mm-hmm.  Her whole life, everyone has told her she could sing  because they don't want to hurt the sweet little girl's feelings,  so she thinks she's really good.  Eh. 
[02:00:00]  It's true.  Wrong.  But at least she's, uh...  She handles rejections up well.  All right, we'll get into that next.  Yeah, Bob Kelly, like, emailed me what she said in one of the papers about her orange bowl appearance.  Was he crying for her?  Even...  Tear-stained little monitor.  Even Bob Kelly wasn't crying for Ashley Simpson, so...  Look at our intern schmoozing with Donnie Deutsch.  Donnie, like, huge Madison Avenue guy.  This guy made a fortune on Madison Avenue.  Oh, he's advertising, right?  Very big, like, go-getter. 
[02:00:30]  This guy is the man.  And now our intern in the suit is going over there and trying to impress him.  Does he understand marketing?  Oh, yeah.  And billboards?  Oh, yeah, we can talk to him about it.  This is the guy we liked.  I'm very happy he's here.  Yeah, we'll talk to Donnie Deutsch next.  Excellent.  He's a very interesting man.  What's going on, Ben?  Nothing.  Why are you laughing?  Where do your friends have the Asians?  No, I just tried calling them because you guys are talking about them.  Oh, they're running around, you know?  They're running around?  Can somebody tell Lisa Loeb glasses that his dumb friends are not going to find anybody? 
[02:01:00]  I also noticed that Ben has decided to grow his sideburns a little longer.  Really?  Yeah, he's adding a little.  Have you added another level onto him?  Look, look.  I messed him up the other day when I was shaving.  Did you?  Why are you growing your sideburns?  Are they remaking Who'll Stop the Rain?  Wow!  That's brilliant, Ben.  Awful to him.  What did he say?  I love him, though.  He scrams his head.  He goes, I'm not going to win.  And he just walks out the door. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, he knows.  But I love Ben.  He's one of my favorite people.  He is really, really fun.  He looks like an English historian with that fake hair.  Ben is a mess on so many levels, but you can't not like Ben.  Isn't he great?  Like, if we do go down to Washington, if we don't have our Nor'easter, I am so looking  forward to hanging out in the hotel bar with Ben.  Like, he's just fun to hang out with.  Never.  I almost said never a dull moment, but that's the way it is.  He's always got something to talk about, and he's usually pretty accurate.  Yeah, of course he does.  Although sometimes he's not. 
[02:02:00]  We're staying at that, are we staying at that cool hotel?  Nice.  The Rouge, yeah.  That's good.  Announce it to everybody.  I say the cool hotel, so I'm not saying the name.  Ben knows exactly what I'm saying.  You just announced the name.  What an idiot.  Eric wonders why he doesn't get to go to New Orleans.  You know, stuff like that.  And Ben's hand goes up.  He's exasperated.  I wish Pat were here to alleviate the tension.  Yeah, why'd you give him the room number?  Yes, Ben?  And I think we're going to get Elo on, too, to talk about our schedule. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great.  That's mini Elo.  Mini Elo.  They're sending Jim a packet of human resources stuff to read.  Are they really?  A packet?  Cool.  How heavy is it?  I'm wondering how far I'll be able to throw it unopened.  All right, we have lots of shows still to do, so let's step aside, and we'll get Donnie  Deutsch in here next.  You love your kids, but sometimes they can be a handful.  Kids are great when they're other people.  Who can you trust when it comes to your young'uns?  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis is a paradise. 
[02:03:00]  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoying.  And most of all, Anthony's love.  I can only hope your child turns up like little Adam Walsh without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around for aesthetics.  Just listen to these happy children frolic through Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid, and I wish him dead. 
[02:03:30]  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat and say...  We love you, Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony's show.  XM 202.  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  O.P. and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony's show.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony's show.  All in all your gender. 
[02:04:00]  Never make it so long.  All in all your gender.  Now we're breaking the war.  All in all your gender.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  It's the O.P. and Anthony virus spreading across America.  And by the way, if you stick around until the end of the show, Eric will be giving out our home addresses and phone numbers. 
[02:04:30]  Don't make him cry again.  Doesn't Eric cry?  Does he care?  He's been known to cry.  When did you cry?  When?  He's not crying.  He's a seasoned vet.  He's been in this business since he was eight years old.  Guy threw a basketball in the back of his head.  Go ahead, squirt.  Yeah, we haven't even really got into Eric's resume.  It's absolutely amazing.  I found out, what, you're only 26, 27 years old?  And he's been working, he's worked at every radio station that we mentioned.  He worked with Alan Freed when he was an infant. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  He was crawling around the studio getting him platters.  He was Marconi's intern.  I told Orson, it's a bad idea.  People are going to take it seriously.  He's a veteran at 26, though.  He's worked for all the assholes in this business in the background.  Orson, you ready for the hoax?  Thank you, idiot.  Thank you, moron.  That's funny. 
[02:05:30]  Rebecca.  Crispy crumb croning.  Goddamn, Pat.  She was here right now.  You've got to love him.  Rebecca, can you hold on for a few more minutes?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Yeah, don't go anywhere, Rebecca.  She sounds very cute, too.  Her name's Rebecca.  She's from North Carolina.  And she wants to play GWIMP.  Gwimp.  She wants to play Gwimp today.  We have to get Donnie in here, man.  Yes, we do.  Big TV star sitting out there staring at us. 
[02:06:00]  That guy's a mover and shaker who can't just sit around waiting.  Time is money.  There he is.  Donnie Deutsch.  Look at this guy.  The Big Idea.  Brand new TV show on CNBC.  Rich, he's in shape.  Taking the place of the John McEnroe show, Anthony.  Low bar.  There you go.  Yeah, there you go.  Do you want to put these things on?  It makes it easier to hear, like, call.  You don't want to mess up that hair of yours.  You don't have to.  As long as you get perfect hair and everything.  Well, you guys got a great gig right in the city here. 
[02:06:30]  I've got to do my show out in Jersey.  Yeah, I don't get that.  CNBC's compound is in the middle of, like, nowhere in Jersey.  It's in Jersey.  Probably the rent is lower.  It's cheaper.  Yeah, but it's a pain in the ass to get guests, I would assume.  Yeah, but no, no.  We're getting there.  We're coming out there.  We've got you guys out there.  Right over the GWB.  Like I said, you're paying in the ass getting guests.  If you had to get us.  Those headphones are the worst.  People just can't figure them out.  He's got, like, a real Steve McQueen vibe to them.  Yeah.  Oh, man, I like that.  A young Steve McQueen, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  A young Steve McQueen as opposed to a dead Steve McQueen. 
[02:07:00]  Didn't work.  Didn't work again.  Didn't work again, right?  There you go.  We've got to make these little...  Kev, fix those, or I'm going to kick you out of the room.  Fix those.  Hey, congratulations on the gig, guys.  I mean, XMN.  Thanks, yeah.  This is, like, nationwide, the future radio.  Pretty psyched.  It's big-time stuff.  Let's get it.  Pretty psyched.  Here we go.  Good.  All right.  All right.  So it's Donnie Deutsch.  Yes, sir.  He's on...  Well, the show's debuts Monday, I guess.  Monday, yes, sir.  Next week, we've got a lot of good guests, man.  We've got Pierce Brosnan, Robert Redford, Dennis Leary, Michael J. Fox, John Leguizamo, 
[02:07:30]  Chevy Chase.  David J. Rimmer, Chevy Chase.  These guys.  We've got a lot of good guys.  We were there for the Chevy interview.  Yeah, we talked about our experience.  Yeah, what was your net taking of it?  What we were getting from it, because it was us and then those two very attractive girls  that wrote that book.  Yes, the Nanny Diary.  Yeah.  Yes.  They were in there.  And we were kind of talking about Chevy's interview, and one of the girls had turned to  us and said, I hope Donnie doesn't take this out on you when you guys don't know. 
[02:08:00]  Chevy is a little quirky, I guess you would say.  A little quirky.  I would think a little hard to work with.  Yes.  It's very difficult to get anything out of him.  And you're figuring he's a comedian, you know?  And it will be a light, fun, airy interview.  Anything but airy.  Well, he got kind of pissed at me, because I said to him, I said, you know, you took a  lot of crap when you...  What words can I...  You can say it whenever you want.  Anything flies here.  Okay, there you go.  So you took a lot of crap from leaving Saturday Night Live after a year, and I said, I know 
[02:08:30]  it was a great move.  Great career move.  Breakout star.  If I didn't leave because of career moves, I left because of a woman in L.A.  I wanted to say, if you left Saturday Night Live because of a woman, pal, you've got  a bigger problem.  That's what we were saying in the dressing room.  It didn't make him look any better.  Why would you say that?  Okay.  A chick.  I left for a chick.  I left the greatest gig in the history of television and comedy because I was...  So you're pretty much telling everyone you're a pussy whip, more than anyone has ever been  pussy whipped before.  He got it completely backwards.  If you had said to him, hey, I heard you left SNL for a chick in California, it's like, 
[02:09:00]  no, I left for my career.  Yeah, man, please.  You know, I'll play with Goldie Hawn, the whole thing.  Can you imagine?  I mean, we all grew up watching that show.  He was huge and he left the show for a girl that wouldn't move to New York.  And where is she now?  That's what he says.  I don't know what...  The girl's with Bill Murray now.  You know, there you go.  I don't know what to buy from him, you know, what to believe or anything.  Because then he said, you asked him about what he's been doing lately and, you know,  you said something like, quite frankly, you know, you haven't been in the forefront.  It wasn't an insult or a dig, but it was the fact that he really hasn't done anything.  And he goes, I've been retired for nine years. 
[02:09:30]  Like, I retired.  And I was thinking, I was waiting for one of his dry jokes about it, but he was dead serious  that he said he was retired.  Yeah, well, I met that guy.  I did that celebrity poker show.  Right.  And he was there.  And literally, he didn't know how to play cards.  I mean, it was literally like taking a guy off the street who had, forget, not even Texas  Holder, I don't know if he was in poker.  And it was interesting.  I saw that episode, and he was, he kind of was doing well, wasn't he?  Well, he got blown out pretty early, but I shouldn't brag because I was Doogie Howser's 
[02:10:00]  bitch on that show.  I mean, imagine losing to Doogie Howser.  Doogie Howser's now cool, though.  Doogie wasn't doing too bad, though.  I know.  Doogie won.  Yeah.  He won.  He took me out, man.  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't mind losing to, like, you know, like Pierce Brosnan or some cool dude  or something.  You know, lose to Doogie Howser, man.  It'd be like losing a rerun or somebody.  You've got to go watch Harry and Kumar because Doogie is now cool.  Oh, he's cool.  Is Doogie cool?  Yeah.  He played himself in the movie where he's, like, doing, you know, coke off strippers' butts  and stuff.  Now, that movie should have done better. 
[02:10:30]  Why didn't that movie?  That was a funny, funny movie.  I haven't seen it yet.  Nothing at the box.  I know.  It had some moments.  Yeah.  It had some moments.  That's about it.  What do you think of Chevy's pink sweater?  I thought the pink sweater with the black zip-up turtleneck motif underneath was a rather interesting  fashion faux pas.  A glamour don't.  We were saying the other day, because one of your producers had a problem with the...  Was that what you were wearing?  No, no, no.  Okay.  I was wearing a gray shirt, and it was light gray.  It wasn't dark gray.  I knew it would show up on black. 
[02:11:00]  It wasn't a problem, and it ended up not being a problem, as I could assume.  No, you guys look good.  But I was thinking it would be funny if I could get Chevy's pink sweater if it would  have aired on the same day, and just walked out.  And Chevy comes out, and then our segment, and I'm wearing the same pink sweater as Chevy.  Did you guys end up in the green room together at all, or are they separated?  No, they separated.  That was a bad joke.  It was Chevy and everyone else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Honestly, if you guys were in there with him, right, what would you guys have gone out  with?  I don't know.  We were in the hair and makeup room with him, and he walked in with blinders on. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, didn't look, didn't say, you know, how you doing, nothing.  I mean, and I didn't want to say anything to him, because the guy comes off as being  very bitter for some reason.  Well, you know, you're doing them Affleck duck commercials now.  Yeah, that might.  And you were, you know, you were in National Lampoon's vacation.  I have an important question, though.  Who was the tranny that they said was there?  They said there was a hot tranny.  Yeah, I was there.  Yeah, she's got a show in Chelsea.  Is it she? 
[02:12:00]  He.  I got confused with that, because I got, I'm looking at it.  It was really weird.  She came out.  He, she came out.  And she was hot.  And I'm looking at her, and I'm going, like, she's kind of hot, so I'm going, am I off  here?  Because I think this chick, who used to be a guy.  I was checking out her ass as she was going to makeup, and I convinced her it was a girl,  until your producer told us.  And then Ann's like, ha, ha, you're looking at a dude's ass.  You're looking at a guy's ass.  Well, I said to her, I said, do you ever, like, make dudes out, where you'll pick up a guy,  and he does you, and then all of a sudden you say, you know, guess what? 
[02:12:30]  Hey, I'm a teamster.  You know what I mean?  And, uh, no, she says she comes clean with people, and she said, I asked her about the  parts, and she said, I'm complete.  So I'm assuming that, you know, the wiener went away.  Oh, complete woman?  Oh, she's post-op.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's got the whole thing.  She's got a, you know, Johnson's gone, and the virgin is there.  Yeah.  That's kind of interesting.  And I kept saying, this is the great part.  I said to her, tell me, okay, you're in the schoolyard, five years old.  Is there anything different going on in your head?  And she goes, no, I'm just, or he, I'm just like everybody else. 
[02:13:00]  I said, come on.  Well, somewhere along the line, all of a sudden, you know, you want to take your genitals out.  Yeah.  It's not like you're playing dodgeball with everybody else.  Something's going amiss here.  Something.  Well, she was sweet.  She was nice.  I mean, it was like, but that's, that's me.  Where's the line?  Where is the place where you're like, all right, I got to get rid of this thing?  That's out there.  That's out there.  This is just annoying me.  Where do you go from being gay to all of a sudden your boyfriend's robbing a bank in Brooklyn  to pay for your sex-shake operation?  Hey, remember that guy's name? 
[02:13:30]  Leon Shermer in the movie.  Wow.  Real name was Ernest Aaron.  And his career has taken off since then, hasn't it?  Oh, he's dead.  Died of AIDS.  Did he really?  Did he?  Aaron became a woman and died of AIDS.  Talk about method acting, huh?  Wow.  He became a woman, died of AIDS while Sonny.  Oh, wow, that's sad.  That's too bad.  How about that?  Oh, yeah, they weren't exactly a healthy couple.  I love the fat wife.  The fat wife, yeah.  She was pretty special.  He says, you pig, get on the ride.  I love it.  Oh, that's great.  So, the big idea, what is it about?  It was kind of weird to be there because we were there only recently for the John McEnroe show. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  It was completely different.  You walk in, there's a live audience.  It's John McEnroe hitting tennis balls into Steve-O's ass.  It was like deja vu because we're in the same dressing room, same makeup lady.  All those people are still there.  Right.  And then we go into the studio area and obviously you guys hosed it down and said, get rid of all this crap and we're going to do a whole different thing.  Yeah.  I mean, my show is just, my show had been a weekly show every night, Sunday nights.  And it's just kind of like a cool, you know, if you look at all the long form talk shows on TV, you got, you got Larry King, you got Charlie Rose. 
[02:14:30]  We're just trying to do like a kind of younger, hip-a version of that.  Just one-on-one, just like you guys came on and we weren't doing, you weren't doing your bits.  You were just talking about your life and about, you know, and all the stuff you went through and the stuff with Stern.  And I think people like that stuff and there's no form on TV for, to me, the young people today, whether they're actors, artists, athletes, whether to come on and talk, just as guys or women and whatnot, not come on and just pitch their next movie.  It was kind of refreshing because I was surprised all of a sudden you said, yeah, I like watching porn.  Yeah.  I didn't think Donnie Deutsch was going to say that. 
[02:15:00]  Well, that's my point.  And especially to us, I'm like, oh, okay, we can hang with this guy.  Well, if you think about...  Definitely some honesty there.  Well, that's it.  If you think about TV, you have anything that is all smart.  It's like, guys, you know, middle-aged white guys talking like this and about school vouchers and things like that.  And then you get entertainment TV versus, like, bring them together.  If we went out for dinner, we might talk about some smart stuff.  We might talk about politics and Bush.  And then you'd go, look at our hot babe over there.  And I just want to bring it all together.  That's who human beings are.  That's who we are.  It's the philosophy of this very program.  That's kind of our show.  And it's not...  It's interesting. 
[02:15:30]  It's not...  It's not that complicated, man.  I don't know why people make me mean...  Shh, don't tell anyone.  More people will do this.  It is.  It's just the stuff that people like to talk about at dinner.  It's just the stuff.  Because we've been on Bill O'Reilly and, you know...  He's a thug, man.  Very serious.  As soon as that story came out with the dildos and the producer, we're like, we've had this guy, you know, figured out a long time ago.  But, you know, he comes and...  There's no honesty in that program whatsoever.  Yeah, he's a thug.  We're going to do a segment on my show called O'Reilly Sucks Every Night.  And it's just so...  But, you know, the thing I like about that guy, I don't care about your politics. 
[02:16:00]  You know, whatever way you go, man.  I mean, he's obviously not a stupid guy, but if he disagrees with something that somebody's doing, he'll say...  For instance, I went on, I was defending Jenna Jameson because she was endorsing pony in an ad, okay?  And he was like, you know, that's porn, endorsing, you know, and puts up every store, Sears, Pennies.  And if you go to any of these stores because they carry these pony sneakers, it's like terrorism.  It's like a form of like, you know, and like, screw you, man.  It's intimidation.  Yeah, and it's just, you know, and the guy's a thug.  He's a bully. 
[02:16:30]  He's a bully, and I'm taking him down.  And he's a hypocrite.  And here's the beautiful thing.  I co-hosted the Porn Awards with her over in 2004.  Right.  And we talked about O'Reilly, and she said that after she did this segment where he was, ah, he asked her for some free porn.  He's like, hey, look, I've never seen one of your movies.  Oh, Jenna said the same thing to me.  She, like, but, like, harassed her.  Like, I want, like, you know, eight copies and this and that and, you know, the whole phone thing and, you know, I mean...  That's one of the pitfalls of being that type of host on that type of show is, you know, if all of a sudden we're caught watching porn, people just, ah, it's O.P. and Anthony watching porn. 
[02:17:00]  It's expected, yeah.  If we're making, you know, sexual phone calls to employees and saying how we want to loofer them in the shower.  Right.  Ah, people go, ah, it's O&A.  Sex and the church guys.  Screw it.  You know, but you're, if you put yourself up on that pedestal, you really got to watch.  You got to watch what you're doing.  When you talk about O.P. and Anthony watching porn, I had the CEO of Vivid Entertainment on my show once who makes the biggest, you know, the biggest porn production company.  He said, you know, there were 800 million porn videos sold last year. 
[02:17:30]  It's not 800 guys buying a million each.  Right, right.  I mean, there's a lot of people obviously watching porn, you know.  It's part of life, man.  It is what it is.  People don't like to see that, though.  They like to think we're these, you know, superhuman beings that don't need that anymore.  And if they don't agree with it, they want it taken away from everybody.  Yeah.  You know?  I'm surprised you guys weren't invited to another one.  Yeah.  I'm really shocked you guys weren't part of that.  Last night there was that black tie and boots ball.  Black tie and boots.  Yeah.  That was it.  Did you guys happen to see the picture a couple weeks ago in the post? 
[02:18:00]  The only black things at that are the ties.  Believe me.  Because what self-respecting black guy is going to the black tie and boots party?  Did you guys see a picture?  There was a photo of the Bush family, the whole clan.  And they were all in black tie.  And George Jr., the president, I'm not making this up, this was in the post, was in black  tie and black cowboy boots and a presidential emblem seal on the cowboy boots.  On the front of his cowboy boots.  Now, I have a few questions.  Number one, whose job is it at the White House?  And are we paying for somebody to sit there?  And who's it like, okay, you know what?  You, you're the one who's in charge of putting the seal on Bush's boots, okay? 
[02:18:30]  I mean, it's just like, where does that come from?  The presidential seal.  Big, gaudy boots, man.  Isn't that awful?  Oh, Jesus.  We were talking about his daughters this morning.  Yeah, yeah.  His daughter's very attractive.  Oh, they're great.  That's, to me, the thing, and I'm a Democrat, and the thing that I saw about the Bushes,  when I saw those daughters for the first time, that gave me hope that they're, because they're  normal girls, they seem like normal girls, and you go, okay, well, maybe they're normal  parents, and...  Yeah, they like going out, having a little drink or two.  I mean, yeah, you know what you say, because I always judge people by, you know, how they raise 
[02:19:00]  their kids, and they look like the kind of girls anybody would have, and, you know,  not perfect, but cute and normal and everything, and I actually gave you hope about Mr. Bush.  And that went away.  Yeah.  The daughters are great, though.  I always had a picture in the paper this morning, and one of them looks just like the mother,  and one looks like the father.  One looks like George.  And you've got to know, they're dating, they're of age where they're probably, I don't know  their lives, but sexually active.  It's just got to be odd for the guy that's with the one that looks like George W. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, you're feeling the pleasure of a sexual encounter, and you're looking at the  president's face.  It just kind of, you know, and I know some Democrats would probably want to flip her over  at that point.  Give her the old get back at.  The old get back at.  That's good.  You know.  Oh, man.  Visually, it was a little odd for me.  Switching subjects, you know, I'd like to offer up my services to you guys as, you know,  a marketing guy, and I don't know what the Opie and Anthony marketing strategy is, if 
[02:20:00]  I can help out with any ads.  Well, your background is huge.  His background is huge on Madison Avenue.  Yeah, yeah.  I built an ad agency.  We've got a great firm called Deutsch.  We've done, you know, great commercials with clients, you know, great corporate clients,  and so I'm here with my services available of you guys, you know, in terms of strategic  positioning or ad campaigns.  One came to mind for me, you know, Opie and Anthony, chicks dig them, guys want to be  them.  I mean, you know, it's kind of a, I like that, look at that.  I like that slogan. 
[02:20:30]  That's more work than XM's done in a year.  Well, Jimmy will explain the marketing that has been done for the Opie and Anthony program  I don't know if we actually need help, but there's actually a campaign going on.  If you drive through Philly, and you make a left on South Street, and you look at the  stop sign, there's actually a wow sticker.  I mean, things are moving along well, and if you call and you request the show, they won't  deny that it's on XM.  So we're really under the radar of guerrilla marketing.  Not even any guerrilla marketing.  We suggested that.  All kidding aside, we are so frustrated. 
[02:21:00]  I mean, there's been little to none as far as the marketing goes.  And, you know, we're getting invited to go on some of these big shows, and they're just  assuming that's going to put the show over the top.  I would think, honestly, if I'm in charge of XM, obviously what Sirius has done brilliantly  with Stern, they're using him to say, wow, and you guys are a franchise, and it's a statement.  Forget about, obviously, they're going to get your listeners to buy XM, but it's a statement  because, obviously, satellite radio is a future radio.  It's what cable TV was 20 years ago and 30 years ago. 
[02:21:30]  So, strategically, I would use you guys, you know, the same way if you're selling Chevrolet,  you use the Corvette to sell it.  It's the badge.  So you guys have the badge of the brand because you guys are the most well-known thing they have,  and obviously you have a tremendous following, so I'm surprised they wouldn't use you guys  more.  Yeah.  They're just kind of hiding us.  I mean, we're still on a premium channel, which is at this, it's a joke at this point.  It really is.  I mean, we've proven ourselves that we don't have horns, you know?  Yeah.  We have this reputation after the Sex for Sam thing, so I understand why the company and  the car dealers, you know, were a little nervous to have us on their platform, but we've 
[02:22:00]  proven ourselves in the first three or four months that we're not going to do anything  that insane.  Yeah, but even from the car dealer's point of view, even if you guys, whatever you guys are going  to do, it's not like the car dealer is endorsing you guys.  He's selling a Mitsubishi or a Pontiac or something.  You happen to be one channel on this, so I think the world's going to find itself.  You know, what I've always found, and I've done a lot of talking about the whole FCC  thing and indecency thing, and in the end, the people vote.  And, you know, for instance, the product that you guys sell, people want, and it's going 
[02:22:30]  to find its way.  And that's the way that line tends to get adjusted.  So, we're going through a little bit of a backlash time now, and those, it always has  its way of, I feel, finding the middle, because the dollars rule.  And, for instance, if you guys have the following that you have, that voice will eventually come  out, and that's the real arbiter at the end of the day.  What type of marketing would you do for this show?  Like, if you, would you do billboards?  Like, what would be the best way to present this show to the general population? 
[02:23:00]  Interesting with you guys, I mean, obviously, TV is still the most powerful medium, but  with you guys, because your audience is obviously very young, and for the first time last year,  they've done surveys that young people are spending more time on the net than TV.  It's the first time ever.  So, I would just do a lot of really crazy stuff on the net, you know, a lot of blog-type  stuff, real underground stuff, and make it a movement, and almost create a movement,  and the whole campaign would be about people don't want you.  People are trying to keep opening anything away from you.  Right.  You know, stop the people who are stopping us kind of thing, and this kind of reverse, 
[02:23:30]  almost fun political campaign of, you know, we want an Anthony opening, and basically have  deprived viewers from all over the country saying, you know, people are not giving me my  opening to Anthony, and I want it, and a really fun, silly kind of thing.  Are you going to bill us for this?  No, this is a complication.  I walk around the streets now going, you know, just give it in marketing advice.  I just like the way you two sneaks try to get free advice.  I know.  Interview them.  How would you advertise?  Next guest from the CPA firm.  You know, we had some smart lawyers coming in. 
[02:24:00]  We had a pen and pen in our head.  Who should we contact in the internet?  We have some guys coming with actuarial tables tomorrow.  What?  I have a question.  What is, if you had to pick one, what would you say is the most brilliant ad campaign you've  seen for any product?  Of all time or recently?  Yeah, of all time.  Either you would look at it and just go, that is the zenith.  I think overall, the Nike work, what they've done for the brand overall, it's not one commercial,  but you just think about where they've positioned that brand is, you know, in terms of just do 
[02:24:30]  it and just the whole essence of that brand, I think is great.  I think the iTunes work recently, the iPod stuff.  Oh, that stuff is hot.  Right on the money.  Definitely.  I think a commercial we did last year for Coors, Wingman, is a really cool spot.  Oh, yeah.  That was very good.  That came from your office?  Yeah, that was our agency.  No kidding.  Our LA office.  Dude, he's a big star.  I know.  We've got big clients, man.  It's just so I think that there's always a lot of fresh work out there, but I actually  think overall, advertising has suffered recently as far as creativity because 
[02:25:00]  I just think as the economy has been tough the last few years, clients tend to hunker  down and say, okay, no more of that creative stuff.  Let's just, you know, hard sell, hard sell.  Yeah, push the product and that thing.  That's it.  You can understand that, but it goes away.  What about Mickey Rooney's ass?  Yeah, thank God we're not going to be seeing that on the Super Bowl.  You know what I mean?  I don't, I want to be in that room.  I always wonder when I watch commercials, I would pay attention.  They obviously banned that commercial from the Super Bowl.  Seven guys, 15 people sitting around, you know, what should we do?  You know, should we get, you know, Beyonce singing? 
[02:25:30]  I got it.  Mickey Rooney's ass.  The guy's high-fiving each other.  That's it.  That's brilliant.  Brilliant.  Which, that's a campaign I love.  That Guinness, you know, the guys are brilliant.  Brilliant.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a really cool campaign.  You got any commercials showing up in the Super Bowl?  No, you know, last five years we've been on the Super Bowl.  This year, we're not on the Super Bowl.  No.  It just kind of worked out that way.  But I actually think the Super Bowl is when advertisers act their stupidest.  For some reason, it's gotten to the point of, and last year was indicative of that.  We had farting horses.  Right.  You know, guys biting crotches. 
[02:26:00]  And for some reason, that day, advertisers say, okay, we've got to be more stupid and  silly and outrageous.  And they end up doing commercials.  Oh, we understand that, right?  Not that you guys would have any reference points.  Honestly, I thought the commercials last year were a lot of fun.  They really were.  I actually think a lot of them missed because you end up doing it.  If I said to you, okay, there was a commercial about it.  I'm just saying a lot of fun.  You don't even, you can't attach the product.  No, that's what my dad used to say all the time.  Right, that's true.  It's like, well, the dog biting the guy in the crotch, what was the product?  Honestly, I have no idea.  I would guess Budweiser because they did a lot of spots, but I don't know. 
[02:26:30]  But like, even if I say like, you know, the what's up commercial, and you go, okay,  well, it's funny, but you can't even attach it to the beer.  And I think that's what's missing with a lot of commercial, and that's the problem.  Where's the Beef was a great one.  Who was that for?  Yeah, where's the beef, where's the beef?  Clara Pella, where's the beef?  That was a well-known, actually, what advertising works best is when it gets into lexicon,  and Mondale used that in his successful presidential book.  What's the lexicon mean?  Into the everyday culture.  No, no, I know, but neither one of them understood. 
[02:27:00]  You ass.  Dude, we were nodding our heads.  We can fake it.  Now, have you guys...  I drive a lexicon.  We don't like people who think that we're actually intelligent.  Now, how did you, how's things going?  We're doing a good job of hiding that, then.  Since you guys have done the XM thing, have they been trying to curtail you in any of your...  No, not at all.  No.  So you're just freewheeling now.  They've been really cool.  Any restrictions we put on the show have been, from us, just thinking, you know,  we'll calm that down a little bit, try to cover this angle a little more. 
[02:27:30]  Or, we're still feeling it out.  Yeah.  You know, we're trying to figure out what it's all about.  The show's always grown, also.  If you look at what we did in Boston, years ago, when we first got together, it's completely  different than what we were doing at WNEW on broadcast radio.  So, and now, this is just another evolution of what the show was morphing into anyway, you  know?  Well, it's interesting.  Do you guys find, you're not 25 years old, you're still young guys, but you're not kids,  you're not out of college. 
[02:28:00]  I find that as an ad guy, as a creative guy over the years, the work that I've been involved  in mirrors kind of where I am in life, that I'm, like it or not, I'm just less crazy now  than when I was 26 years old, and the work reflects that.  So, do you guys find now that you're, you know, around 40, whatever it is, versus 27,  you're just naturally doing different stuff?  Yeah, you know.  No, we're still assholes.  Yeah, we're still complete asses.  No, you do, you do wind up doing different stuff.  I don't know if it's so much more, you know, calming down or anything.  It's just, yeah, I'm not up till all hours drinking at four in the morning, but I think 
[02:28:30]  that's more because I have to get up early than me calming down.  So, yeah, you do notice your sensibilities kind of change a little bit, and what you find,  not even so much, I still find the most immature things funny.  Though, I'm wondering if I'll ever grow out of that.  No, no, no, hopefully not.  You know, and seeing when a girl comes in here and takes her shirt off, and, you know,  her lovely bosoms flop out of that bra, it still gives you that thrill, you know? 
[02:29:00]  Not that that's going to happen, but did you guys see one of my beautiful assistants, Stephanie?  I was wondering who that was.  Stephanie?  Gorgeous.  Stephanie?  Yeah, there's a little delay.  There's a delay, so in about 10 seconds you'll see her go, what?  What?  Oh, what?  And there's my publicist touching it.  Leave her alone.  Stephanie, I was just telling them how beautiful you are out there.  Now she's waving, see?  Now she's waving.  There's Adam also.  Everybody's here.  She has a Heather Locklear look to her.  She's cute, isn't she?  She's very, very good at what she does.  She's single?  Does she have a gentleman friend?  No.  Guys out there, she's single. 
[02:29:30]  No guys in here.  Yeah, she's single.  I'm lonely.  He's got eyes, Don.  Donnie's got eyes, Jimmy.  She's going to turn around.  She's waving to her.  Oh, I thought you wanted her to turn around.  She's like a 10.  She's adorable.  She's adorable.  Can we call her in?  We're not allowed to do that.  Yeah, you can bring her in.  Steph, come on in.  You can knock on the window there, Jimmy.  Come on in.  Oh, my God.  Come on in.  That face of horror she just put on.  Into the lies.  Oh, she's not happy.  Come on in.  I can't help it.  They were looking out there, and they said, who's that beautiful girl? 
[02:30:00]  Come sit.  Share the seat.  There you go.  Share the seat.  How are you doing?  What's going on here?  Hey, how are you?  You're Donnie's assistant?  Yes.  Glorified position.  Now, I don't know what your background is as far as relationships go, Donnie.  Purely business.  She's got a few assistants that help run everything, and she's one of the top ones.  You're going to have to share that mic.  I don't think I can hear you very well.  Yeah, get closer to her, Donnie.  Yeah.  There you go.  You know you want to.  She's terrific.  She's actually a former runner-up Miss Arkansas. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  He hasn't made any phone calls offering to loof for you in the shower.  Or, no, nothing like O'Reilly?  Not yet.  Thank goodness.  Wow.  Yeah, very, very attractive.  You have a Heather Locklear quality to you.  Oh, thank you.  Have you ever heard of that?  Have you ever heard of that?  You're beautiful.  No.  No, I haven't.  Wow.  It's more of a Ruth Buzzy thing.  Ruth Buzzy?  Wow.  All you Ruth Buzzy fans have.  I met her on a plane and got an autograph.  I don't know who that is, and that's probably for the best.  Wait, her face or her voice?  I'm kidding.  Of course he's kidding, Opie. 
[02:31:00]  Well, I wasn't sure.  Whatever.  Okay.  What's the day like with Donnie?  A little difficult?  You know, it's crazy.  We're at the ad agency, and then we're at CNBC, and Donnie has a book coming out, so I'm  kind of a jack of all trades.  I do whatever he needs me to do.  Yeah.  To an extent.  To an extent, of course.  But it's kind of odd that you would get a guy that's in one business, like the whole  Madison Avenue thing, and then also television.  You know, it's like two completely different animals, and you've got to hold this whole  thing together?  Yeah.  I've got to keep him organized. 
[02:31:30]  I've got to keep that calendar together, keep him on time, keep him as organized as  he can be, because he's a busy man.  He has a lot going on.  He certainly does.  I've never heard her say such nice things about me.  Really?  She's talking like she literally abuses me during the day.  It's just, it's really...  He warrants it, though, right?  You can tell.  She just found his bank statement.  You have a very lovely smile.  Yeah.  Thank you.  He's talking to Donnie.  Jimmy got so reserved.  He just...  Well, Jimmy...  Oh, he gets all shy. 
[02:32:00]  She's a nice girl.  Well, Jimmy gets awkward around really pretty girls.  Jimmy's got this thing going.  He doesn't have much hair on his body, and he gets self-conscious about it.  No, chicks like that.  No, look, yeah.  Look, look.  There's no hair.  It's very wispy.  It's a couple of wispy hairs.  Chicks dig that.  Feel how wispy the hair is.  Jimmy, would you let her just touch your arm?  Sorry.  What a complete ass.  That's interesting.  That's a hair...  I haven't seen too many hair on his arm.  It is very hair off.  I should be walking out of a spaceship with my body. 
[02:32:30]  I'm a disgrace.  What is Private Pyle doing in here with a camera?  Oof.  What?  You really are getting a Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket look to you.  You're an odd guy.  That's Martini Stevie.  He works for us, and he's absolutely insane at this point.  I actually had the guy, Vincent D'Onofrio, on my show who played...  Pyle.  ...who was the single worst interview I have had.  Really?  Really?  Talking to Mike, they're going nuts.  He would never...  I had the guy who played that character, Vincent D'Onofrio, on my show.  Great actor.  Bad interview, though. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  Difficult?  Or just...  Head down kind of thing?  Can't get anything out of him?  Yeah, nothing.  How were we?  Were we kind of average?  What?  A blowout?  It was a great interview.  Wow, look at that.  And the CNBC guys were worried the lawyers didn't want to have you on because you guys  were going to have to beep everything and blah, blah, blah.  Isn't that weird?  We had the worst reputation.  But they have to go, wow, that was great, man.  And they were just great.  I mean, it was really...  My family doesn't even get it.  They put me on seven-second delay at Thanksgiving.  They think I'm just going to...  Hey, Grandma, where's that effing turkey?  But here's the thing. 
[02:33:30]  Here's what's not surprising.  Yeah, you guys do bits.  You're human beings outside of here.  Where you can have discussions about life and women.  Wow.  And you actually understand that.  That's the first time I've ever heard that.  You don't walk on the street farting and cursing.  I mean, this is not tough to figure out, you know?  So when is our interview airing?  Sometime the next couple of weeks.  They kind of slot stuff in.  We'll give you guys a heads up.  Will you let us know?  Yeah, I'll send you a tape, too.  Thank you.  All right.  Don, I have an advertising question for you.  Like, our friend Steve here wants to get into the business.  What would he be good at advertising besides apartments in Chelsea? 
[02:34:00]  What would he be good at in the business?  Yeah, because he's got his own vibe, his own look.  Looks like a mailroom kind of guy, you know?  Ooh.  A mailroom?  Well, you know.  M-A-L-E room.  Dude, when is that hair going to grow in?  I just decided that it's just horrific.  Now, can you be straight with that hair?  There you go.  Yeah, what do you think is going on, Donnie?  He had to come in and dye his hair blonde like that.  Well, the young kids today who like the rock and roll, I hear they do that a lot. 
[02:34:30]  So I don't know.  That's not necessarily, you know, that's kind of like a wacky, crazy, you know, let's pile  in a phone booth kind of thing.  Yeah, it was an impulsive move, and I've been regretting it ever since the five seconds  after I took the bag with the solution off my head.  Yeah, I'm waiting for it to grow in.  Our Bud Dwyer made a better impulsive move.  Our office is in Chelsea.  And you'd be very popular walking down the street with that haircut.  And you're not regretting it because you would have just shaved it all off.  I'm waiting for the little specks of brown to grow back in. 
[02:35:00]  He's holding the dye out.  Now get back.  Someone's going to get hurt.  Don't dye your hair, Bud.  Don't dye your hair.  Don't feel bad.  A lot of people think Donnie's gay.  Really?  They actually just assume that he is.  They're like, oh, you're...  Well, I get some...  Here's the thing.  This is amazing.  Because he's a good-looking guy and he's in shape.  In shape, yeah.  Exactly it.  That's what happens.  This is the baby teeth.  If you're in shape, people automatically...  And you dress not like a complete idiot.  People assume that.  I kind of crack up at it.  I kind of like it.  That means I'm a good-looking guy.  There you go.  That's it.  Believe me, a lot of guys feel bad when gay guys don't come on to them. 
[02:35:30]  Well, I don't want them to come on to me.  I do.  I don't want to be on everybody's dance call.  It's not that kind of thing, you know.  If you're not biting a pillow by midnight, you're feeling a little bad about yourself.  That's what I've noticed.  Very good, Steve.  Isn't that funny?  The highlighter is the same color as his head.  It's like he highlighted his whole head.  Talk about this, guys.  But you obviously like it.  You could get rid of it.  Like in a day.  I'm getting rid of it. 
[02:36:00]  If you want to see how to get rid of it, watch Full Metal Jacket 25 minutes in.  It's a fine way to fix that hairdo.  Sit on the toilet.  He comes in with a new look every day, Donnie.  We love you a long, long time.  Every day.  Do you really have $200 million in the bank?  Wow.  Yeah, more than that, actually, probably, you know.  That's nice.  Is he for real?  Well, it says, Donnie Deutsch, the last of the Masson Avenue, Wildman, has got a $200 million bank account. 
[02:36:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, we sold our company a few years ago, got a big payday, and a kid from Queens made good, you know.  It's just proof you don't have to be smart to make a lot of money.  That's fantastic, man.  What was the biggest purchase you ever did?  Just like, I'm doing great with my career and my life.  I'm going to go out and splurge.  I'm not a big toys guy.  It's interesting.  My accountant, he kept saying to me, like, a year after.  I saw the agency had this big windfall.  People keep asking me, what is Donnie doing with that money?  Nothing.  I mean, it's nothing.  It's interesting. 
[02:37:00]  I used to do advertising for Publishers Clearinghouse, you know, the Prize Patrol and really $10 million.  And they did it.  They always stayed in touch with all the people that won the $10 million prize.  And the only people that ended up happy were the people that kept their lives the same.  They kept working.  Maybe they obviously took their kids from college.  The people that all screwed up their lives.  The people that said, okay, I'm not working anymore and this and that.  I'm going to do this and that.  And so nothing's changed.  I mean, it's, you know, there's just, there's one luxury I find about having a lot of money.  It's that you don't worry about money anymore, which is a big one.  Because in life, there's family and there's love and there's health and money. 
[02:37:30]  And that's what you worry about.  And hot chicks.  You take it off the table.  Other than that.  Do you ever get shot down by girls?  I would just carry a copy of my bank statement.  If a girl just said no, I'd go, ha ha, stupid.  I'd walk away from her.  Well, I do get from time to time, like girls that I dated in my early 20s and stuff like that,  they'll go like, Jesus, I was such an idiot in terms of what not.  But, yeah, money does, it's interesting.  I have this discussion.  I'm happily married.  I have a beautiful wife.  Oh, you're married?  Yeah, beautiful wife. 
[02:38:00]  Beautiful assistant.  You know, it's kind of a theme here.  And I often say to her, not that she's not in love with me, but if I met her, maybe I was a schoolteacher,  she might not have fallen in love with me.  It's part of who you are is your success and your power and stature.  It does become who you are, part of who you are.  You don't want something to be with you just because of that.  But, no, would she be in love with me?  Probably not.  That doesn't mean she's not in love with me and she didn't fall in love with me for other reasons.  That's how Jim thinks.  I'm a stand-up comic for one reason.  The drunk chick at the end of the night, hopefully in the car, that found me slightly amusing, 
[02:38:30]  and it will overlook my misshapen torso.  Right.  Believe me, yeah.  You know, it's like, I'm only doing this because you're fighting.  Please, before you're fighting.  Thank you.  I have a theory with everything, and I talked to Trump about this.  I have a book coming out, actually, and one of the chapters is it's all about women.  Everything we do in life, guys, is at the end of the day to get women.  Wow.  Everything we do is to make us more attractive.  And, like, what's the point of how...  You nailed it.  And it's not about money or a good career.  Even the guy that's working in a garage, I mean, the same freaking thing, at the end 
[02:39:00]  of the day.  It's about, how do you get the chicks, man?  Very Freudian, actually.  Freudian, you know, it's about the whole sexual...  I really believe that.  Everything we do is done, so somehow we are more attractive to the same-sex, opposite-sex,  whatever your persuasion.  I think it's very primal and very raw.  That's all animals.  We're all animals.  That's it, man.  I think cavemen wanted the shiniest stick that could beat up the other caveman, so he could  get the hot cavewoman.  Maybe the whitest hair on your head.  Yeah, exactly.  With the yellowest, highlighted-like color hair on your head, maybe that gets the women. 
[02:39:30]  Maybe you live by the airport, and if there's a power outage, you want planes to be able  to land so you can stand there with that awful blonde thing on your skull.  Poor Steve, man.  He's the worst.  He is probably dying it in the studio right now.  Did you see our intern out there?  Yeah, I love...  This is the world upside down.  You go, oh, you guys dress, t-shirts, jeans, and you got the intern in the goddamn suit,  man.  The intern, he's pretty new.  Okay.  Guy Noah.  New kid here.  Oh, good Noah.  And he is a go-getter.  This kid's coming in as an intern on this show in this suit. 
[02:40:00]  Look at him.  He looks like he's working at a law firm.  Noah, what was the thinking when you got up in the morning and you said, okay, I'm going  to put on this nice, you know...  It's a really nice suit, right?  It is a nice suit.  Anthony and I wouldn't know.  He's got, by the way, he's got that little Gucci belt thing working there.  Yeah.  Look at that.  A Gucci belt.  Gucci belt.  He definitely comes from some cash.  Noah, what's the thought on the suit?  Because I package people, marketing, everything like that.  So what was the thing?  Because you're branding yourself, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  So what statement were you trying to make? 
[02:40:30]  I guess I'm trying to make good impression.  But I would argue if I was managing your career, I'd say, okay, you want to fit in.  Basic thing.  For instance, if I go to work, I'm going to work at a bad example.  I go to work in a gas station and I want to fit in.  I'm probably putting on some overalls and grease.  I'm not showing up in a Gucci belt.  So I could use the same logic here that you want to fit in.  So why are you dressed like that?  I like to stand out.  Good answer.  Oh, so he's making a...  Good answer.  It's not only, look, I'm a professional and I'm willing to dress the part, but I want the 
[02:41:00]  attention focused on me a little more.  Exactly.  Show him the shoes.  Noah.  Okay.  Let's get the Brunos.  Bruno.  Bruno Molle shoes.  Yeah, he's working.  He's an intern.  Definitely working.  I'm assuming the intern pay scales are not huge here.  So there's probably some other income streams coming in.  What does your dad do?  My dad, he runs a truck dealership in Philadelphia.  Truck dealership.  He's got a lot of money.  Oh, he owns it.  Holy crap.  There's not like a crooked nose thing there, is it? 
[02:41:30]  No, a nice Jewish boy.  No, obviously not.  Hey, Donnie, do you read body language?  Yeah.  Here's another one of our interns.  Here's the other end of the spectrum.  I know his arms folded.  He's in his Metallica shirt and winter hat that has the Metallica logo.  What is he trying to say?  He's in a three-piece suit I haven't shaved in a week.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, if these two guys go out and they're looking for chicks, he's getting laid.  Yeah, that's obvious.  Depends on where they go.  If they go to a bar on Wall Street, Noah's picking up. 
[02:42:00]  That's a good point.  He's getting booted.  No offense, Danny.  I mean, you had great cheeks, but he's a much better dress.  I never say I dress like this every day.  Wait, you showed up in a, what was it, a velvet coat the first time?  Yeah, a velvet blazer.  Guys, we have an in-house focus group here.  Why don't we ask Princess Stephanie, two guys, because you're a similar age, you guys are  late 20s or something?  Mid.  Give a take.  21.  So you're in a bar.  Let's say it's an open bar where all types come in.  And these two guys...  Like the Mos Eisley Space Base Bar. 
[02:42:30]  These two guys kind of come up to you.  And they're both good-looking young dudes and whatnot.  And he's got kind of the biker, the Colin Farrell knit hat pulled down.  And here we got the Gucci belt.  Which way are you going?  Girls always like the bad boys.  I think I would have to go, you know, with my man here.  Yes.  In the Metallica shirt.  Honestly, I don't think he'd be interested anyway if you went for him.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  Some accusations being made.  He's going around the studio.  I think Danny definitely has a problem with new intern, Noah. 
[02:43:00]  Aw, don't judge a man by his Gucci belt now.  That's right.  You can't judge a guy by his knee pads.  That's a sharp, Noah.  The jealous man.  The jealous man.  And that's what straight guys do when they can't compete with, like, a slick dude.  Aw, he's gay.  Any guys who's like, aw, he's gay.  Don't take that man.  Let me see your hands.  Put your hands.  Look at his nails.  They're nicely clipped.  Well, I will say one thing, though.  I was with a friend's daughter the other night.  She's 18.  We're off at dinner.  And she was talking about her boyfriend.  And the mother was making jokes that she thinks the boyfriends may be gay. 
[02:43:30]  And I said, well, why does your mom think that?  She says, well, he waxes his eyebrows.  I said, ding, ding, we have a winner.  I mean, you're waxing your eyebrows, man.  That's the telltale side.  Not necessarily manicure, but that, to me, pretty much is.  A lot of the guys picked up on that metrosexual thing, where they feel now it's fine to do  a lot of things that only gay guys did, to look better as a heterosexual guy.  Like Anthony doesn't shave his package.  Anthony doesn't shave his package.  No.  What you do? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, we went over this.  I keep it clean down there.  That's a generational thing.  Jesus.  The young guys today, that grooming, the general grooming.  Do you trim it?  I trim with scissors.  I don't shave.  I don't have to shave.  A little trim.  Yeah, there have been trims done, of course.  There have been trims done.  There's been trims done, but you're not getting the razor out and going down to skin in any  area.  Anthony's also packing.  But it doesn't look like a 70s porno.  That's how you guys, you know. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  We had a, well, it happened in north of Massachusetts, north of Boston that one day.  Boston somewhere.  Boy, I see.  That was our younger days.  I didn't see it, and I didn't want to see it, but it was just a reaction that the  girls gave when...  Girls were walking out of a bar.  Anthony was behind this van showing everybody.  A bunch of girls walked out of a bar that was having a male strip show happen inside  of it.  Hold on.  We were doing a gig.  Explain a little further.  Okay.  Thank you.  I was saying, we were doing a gig at the bar next door.  Well, it was like a mall of bars.  It was a weird concept they had up there.  It doesn't need a huge explanation of the parking lot size and everything else, so I'm 
[02:45:00]  just running through it pretty quickly.  Okay.  It was a bar we were doing a gig at.  Next door, bar, girls in it, watching guys dance.  They all come out, and they're all frothed up, and there's no guys.  They don't leave with them.  So a bunch of these girls leave, go into the parking lot.  We're in the parking lot, and with their inimitable Boston accents, the girls went,  show us your cock.  We didn't know what they were saying.  We thought there was a car?  We thought there was a car? 
[02:45:30]  What?  And we're walking by.  Yeah, mine's parked over there.  Yeah, cock.  So we had had a few, and we wanted to make a trade-off.  Go, yeah, show me yours.  I'll show you mine.  All of a sudden, we turned into six-year-olds in the backyard, in the shed, yeah, playing doctor.  Not turned into, they were.  Yes, it was a little inappropriate.  Her name was Jean Bonnet, okay?  And we walked out, and they were impressed.  Yeah, yeah, and then it was, you know, the zip, and Opie was around the other side of the van. 
[02:46:00]  I was in the front of the van talking to a couple of girls, and Anthony goes, you want to see it?  You want to see it?  All right.  So he walks to the back of the van with about four or five.  I mean, there was, I don't know, at least ten of them.  And all I hear from the front of the van is, wow!  It was a lucky, it was all a timing issue.  It was all timing.  There was no shrinkage, in other words.  Yeah, there was no shrinkage, and perhaps it was even starting to think forward at me going to be seeing her parts.  Well, she was also really drunk, so you could have, like, stuck a Heineken bottle just coming out of your shorts. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, right.  So, ooh, it's green.  And Ben, when it went over, they would have been like, what's he doing?  He's drinking out of it.  So I went into panic mode, because I know they're coming after me now.  Right.  You know, because that's what it was all about.  I'm like, oh, my God.  So I'm like, I'm working the area.  I'm like, I'm in.  And they came, you know, toward me.  I'm like, I have nothing going on.  I'm a shower.  No, I'm not a shower.  I'm a grower.  He backed out.  I backed out.  Really?  I'm out of it.  Yeah.  Dude, I was very disappointed.  I was, like, hung like an acorn at that moment. 
[02:47:00]  There was nothing going on.  The girls were very disappointed.  So I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, and then they, yeah, then the girl that was getting married, that slob, she lifted  up something and everything fell toward earth.  Yeah.  It wasn't a fair trade-off.  No, not at all.  I didn't get the better part of that deal, that's for sure.  Hey, guys, I'm going to jump out.  I've got to go to work.  Yeah, you're a busy guy.  We understand.  I appreciate you having me on.  I forgot we were doing a radio show.  I thought we were just hanging out.  I want to get you guys on the show again, right?  Really?  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Were you just saying that? 
[02:47:30]  Well, because we didn't really piss off the lawyers, so we've got to get you back in.  Now I feel a little disappointed.  Yeah, we didn't annoy the lawyers.  Yeah, we'll get it back.  But hey, guys, congratulations.  Continued success on the show, man.  Thank you, Donnie.  It was great.  The big idea starts Monday on CNBC.  10 o'clock.  I think it's going to be a good show, man.  Thanks, guys.  I really do.  Check it out.  Rock and roll.  All right, and goodbye to the beautiful assistant.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, go take a picture, Jimmy.  Good time, guys.  I'm going to get my camera to get a show again.  All right.  There he goes, Donnie Deutsch.  Take it easy, man.  We're going to walk to make more money.  I love that guy.  He's all right. 
[02:48:00]  He was fun, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  He's just one of those, you know, the term would be a man's man.  Look at his assistant.  You bend down and pick that up.  She turned around right when we were gawking at her.  I know.  And then you got to give her the awkward smile and wave.  Danny, drop something in front of her.  What's she going to do?  No, it's too late now.  Drop something in front of her.  You're hog.  She put her coat on, so it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  All right.  Why don't we take a little break? 
[02:48:30]  Jimmy's taking pictures.  Is he taking pictures with the girl, too?  No.  There you go.  No.  He just wants a celebrity photo.  Yeah.  Ben, here's your chance to abuse him.  He's not in here.  Well, he's just funny.  He's like, I've got to get my camera.  He loves taking pictures with people.  Take a picture with the blonde, too, Jimmy.  No?  No?  All right.  No.  She's not famous.  All right.  We've got to stop getting him against that.  We've got to start taking him this way.  Hey, talk into the microphone, genius.  Oh, sorry.  Wow.  Wow.  You've got some confidence right now. 
[02:49:00]  You really smashed my fat face.  I like you.  I like you, Ben.  You've got balls.  This is for you, huh?  Wow.  Very good.  You're going to take that, Jimmy.  Don't we have that clip today?  Gossip.  This whole family's gossips.  I'm a helmet.  I'm a helmet, not an anteater, by the way.  People are asking.  Very good.  We've got to stop taking the pictures facing the window because they come out a little bit lighter.  I said that a long time ago.  I'm not disagreeing.  Okay.  Hence the shades. 
[02:49:30]  Rob?  Rob?  Did you hear the breathing?  Oh, who?  I'm John Merrick, the producer?  I was sitting here.  I just wanted everyone to be quiet for a second.  And Ben is...  Oh, that was you?  That was Ben.  Was I?  Yeah.  You were breathing so loud.  Oh, I thought that was the caller.  Hello, my name is Ben Sparks.  I'm very pleased to meet you.  What's up, Rob?  I'm not an animal.  I'm a herky-toky. 
[02:50:00]  Go ahead, Rob.  What's up?  Hey.  You guys are great.  Thanks.  Thank you, sir.  We're great, unless we're taking phone calls.  Glad to hear the show.  Thanks, man.  Anything else?  Hopi?  Yeah.  Hopes?  Yeah.  Got to ask you a question, man.  Go ahead.  Did you, um...  Oh, my God.  Hopi?  Yeah.  My cell phone's terrible.  I'm going to call you tomorrow.  He's right here.  He can hear you.  Go, Rob.  Go.  Ask.  I love your show, and I thought Donnie was going to be a bomb. 
[02:50:30]  Great guest.  Good call.  He was a lot of fun.  I want him back, man.  The guy's really intelligent and gets how this...  I know you should.  When you bring somebody on, it's a good call.  I really enjoyed it.  You should be listening.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Thank you, sir.  No, Donnie gets what this is all about.  That was a lot of fun.  He's one of those guys that can sit down and just hang out.  See, I like that.  I like when we get in that mode with guests where you forget you're even on the radio,  you're just hanging and talking and just...  $200 million. 
[02:51:00]  $200 million.  Yeah, but he casually goes, I think it's even more than that.  Can you imagine?  Of course.  He's making interest every second on that.  His assistant is so hot.  Yeah.  What would I have to...  Where would I take her?  Oh.  She hangs out with a guy who's worth almost a quarter billion.  Anywhere.  You know his life is private jets, cruise ships that he just books for him and just his  party in the Mediterranean.  Let's get buddy-buddy with the guy.  We should.  Believe me, you think I don't want some help on this mortgage I'm working on?  Donnie, please. 
[02:51:30]  Give me a bag of shells for him.  Papamunaki never called in.  Dude, I got...  Well, we got a leak.  Where are you going?  Well, leak.  Yeah, leak.  I was leaking from my mouth a bunch of eggnog.  What?  Oh, mother crap.  Are you referring to puke, Anthony?  A little puke.  Oh.  Eggnoggy.  Wait a minute. 
[02:52:00]  Before we go to break, where's our producer Ben Sparks?  Where's the herky-jerky man?  Look for the bobbing yellow head.  We should make him paint his head yellow just so he's like one of those little things.  It's Ben.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hurricane Ben.  Love it.  Sugar.  It's Ben.  Ben.  Are we going to get tickets to the Super Bowl for one of our fine listeners?  That's something we just have to do.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Because we have to bring back the chowder contest.  Ah, chowder.  I'm sure Pat will show up for that.  We need another puking contest for a trip to the Super Bowl.  That should be a no-brainer for a big company like XM, no?  Ha ha.  Clam chowder.  Seafood.  Seafood, eat food.  Super Bowl of chowder.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  In the groove.  Opie and Anthony.  Do some pushups, fatty.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:53:00]  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  That's O.B. and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  XM 202.  Damn it, we wanted that audio.  We never got that audio? 
[02:53:30]  Of the dirty bomb?  Our old pal, Mayor Menino, talking about the dirty bomb in Massachusetts.  There were reports of a dirty bomb.  What an ass.  Ben's friends still searching for the terrorists.  Thank God they are on the job.  Well, get them coax.  The A-team for alcoholics.  We need one more update from Ben.  And I'm sure he's in constant contact with his Boston friends. 
[02:54:00]  Let's see if they're getting close to the Chinese terrorists and the dirty bomb.  Oh, he's instant messaging people and herking and jerking, clapping.  Let's go to Toronto today.  Rick, what's up?  Oh, Jimmy.  Rick.  Can you give it up and just go home?  Did you have a Steve alarm go off in the house last night?  You just couldn't cut the grade today?  What's the problem with Jimmy?  Jimmy just had a killer line just now.  Jimmy's been cracking me up all day. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, he's been putting me to sleep all day.  I have to keep slapping myself in the face to wake up to catch these guys.  Now, you know who you want to slap in the face is your mother for raising you in such  a faggotty, no-military-having country, you Canadian jizzbucket.  Your country stinks.  You're second to the United States and you're wannabes.  All you do is let towers from the military flood in.  You produce nothing.  You have shitty medical care.  Your whole country is garbage, except for Paul and Carla.  Except for Paul and Carla.  I know you don't know who they are, stupid. 
[02:55:00]  You dumb, faggoty, Midwestern accent.  About and house.  Go home.  About and house.  Go home.  Home.  Go home.  I'm not kidding, man.  I'm serious.  I know you're not kidding, and I don't care.  You're a sharp-dressed intern that would be glad to take your place today.  How does it feel, faggot, that you can't even get XM legally because you're stupid?  The FCC and your garbage, second-to-us country won't allow this type of programming.  How does that feel, that you have to illegally get XM satellite radio, you jizzbucket in a 
[02:55:30]  second-rate nation?  No, you gave us no help in the Iraq war.  Your country is worthless.  You're worthless.  You're a nation of cowards.  I wouldn't have.  Of course you wouldn't have.  You're a nation of cowards.  You want to ride the back of the United States and not help us like men when we need you.  Oh, please.  That's good.  What are you, a fat girl in 1988?  Oh, please.  Is that the best you can do to defend your country, faggot bunch of cowards?  Didn't help us when we needed, and you wanted part in the Reconstruction. 
[02:56:00]  Well, we don't want nothing to do with the Reconstruction.  Yes, you did, stupid.  That's not Halliburton.  Halliburton's got it all tied up, buddy.  Oh, really?  Really?  Halliburton?  What do you know about Halliburton?  Your faggoty prime minister was begging for help.  They wanted to be involved with the Reconstruction, and we said no.  Oh, please.  You said no.  Stop saying police again, fat chick in the 80s.  That's great, man.  Stop saying police.  Come back in tomorrow, maybe you've got something for a change.  The only thing you have in Toronto is a big needle, which your mother should squat thrust  over.  That's what your whole city is known for.  A bunch of bikes. 
[02:56:30]  Of course he hung up.  Of course he hung up.  Ugh.  You know, I'm starting to agree with Washington.  I think he needs some sensitivity training.  My God.  Ugh, just a Canadian.  Ugh.  Jimmy, don't forget, the agenda's right here when we go to Washington.  Oh, a boat.  Go a boat.  Tuesday, 1.30 to 4.30.  Human resources, sensitivity training for a little Jimmy Norton.  Not happening.  It's right there, dude.  Not happening.  It's part of the agenda. 
[02:57:00]  Really?  Well, there's going to be a little fire set at the complex, and as we all run out, I'll  just run to the train station.  Maybe I'll take a train to Canada.  Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Yuck.  Dude, Eric Logan.  Pat from Canada.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, oh.  House.  Eh, eh, house.  Dude, Eric Logan set up the agenda, and he feels like you need sensitivity training.  Sexual harassment, human resources.  Sexual harassment?  Who do I harass?  Yeah, who is he harassed?  No, you haven't harassed anyone, but you've got to watch the films and stuff.  Not watch them.  Films?  Yeah, the films. 
[02:57:30]  Not watch them.  Huh?  Well.  Nope.  Politically correct drivel.  Again, that's the type of stuff that, in Canada, you can't even have, like,  erasist programming.  They edit the content, and I mean not as far as language, but as far as you can't  make fun of certain things, because they are borderline communists.  Right.  They are socialists, and they're borderline communists.  It's a garbage country.  Would have been taken over by someone if we weren't sitting just to the south for years.  Dude, they make me nauseous on such a base level, I can't tell you.  What an easy target Canada would be if we weren't sitting here. 
[02:58:00]  Dude, a little-known fact, we owned Montreal.  It was part of America for, like, a day.  And then, we didn't want it.  This is what I hate about those-  We didn't want it.  Who wants it?  Did you know that?  That it was part of the United States a long time ago?  At some point.  But we just give it back to them?  Pretty much.  Yeah, they all sound like homos.  Take it.  Take it.  Frozen Tundra.  I've done the Montreal Comedy Festival a couple times, and I do the Nasty Show, and  it sells out.  600 C Theater.  13 shows sell out.  They've got a great sense of humor up there. 
[02:58:30]  Because they're starved for any type of entertainment that's a little edgy.  Yep.  They're repressed.  Dude, I went there a couple times, too, and they're a great audience for comedy.  Yeah, they stink.  And their strip clubs are overrated.  And every chick down there stinks.  All right, now you're getting crazy.  No, I'm not.  I believe it.  The women of Montreal are beautiful.  Overrated.  Overrated.  No way.  I think they're hotter than a lot of the women you see walking around New York City.  Nah.  Definitely.  So, what are we going to say to Elo about these meetings and the agenda?  That we're not going.  Yeah, why even acknowledge it?  Just don't do it. 
[02:59:00]  We say that we're not going.  But they have a whole schedule.  People are going to be sitting in conference rooms waiting for us to show up.  Let them sit.  Let them sit.  Yep.  Unless we all want to draw straws and the one that loses has to go and represent the entire show.  But it ain't going to be me.  I'll tell you one thing.  In-room movies, room service.  That's who I'm meeting with.  I'm meeting with the wonderful person at the door with the cart.  Then why are we going there?  We have to go down there.  Room service.  We have to go down there and kind of like, you know.  I'll have a meeting right after this show.  We have to get some face time with some of these people. 
[02:59:30]  I won't have synergy or face time.  Yeah.  I'm having a meeting after the show with a couple of people that are very involved with  the future of this program.  Anyone else?  Bye.  See ya.  Well, Army wants in on this really fast.  Army the trucker.  Go ahead, Army.  Yeah.  Consensitivity for others.  Consideration for others.  Training.  Give me a break.  Oh.  What kind of garbage is this?  I'll tell you what, it's...  This stuff is weakening our country.  It's making us a country of pussies. 
[03:00:00]  I don't think so, man.  Dude, it's more thought policing by the left.  Yep.  That's all.  It's more thought...  And again, if you're sexually harassing somebody at work, you should be fired.  But don't try to cut me off with the past.  I was raised, right?  Well, it's corporate BS that they want us to go through.  Because these corporate scumbags have been protecting people who make money for the company,  who sexually harass their secretaries, so they protect the guys that make the money.  All right, man.  They protect these guys, and then they make the rest of the people in the corporation suffer  because they got sued because they overprotected the guys that they should have fired. 
[03:00:30]  Well, dude, I don't want to deal with the whole ELO thing.  Someone else has got to deal with the phone call saying that...  I'll deal with it.  Not going.  Click.  That this agenda is way out of hand.  Yep.  Well, I don't really care about the sensitivity of training because I don't see Anthony and  my name next to that part of this agenda.  No, I just see us on Monday with 19 hours of meetings.  All the way to 9.30 at night.  That ain't happening.  We'll cut a few of these things out, but, you know, we will get some face time with some 
[03:01:00]  of the people down there and, you know, and talk about how to make this show better.  I'm drooling on my pillow by 9.30.  Yeah.  I will not be sitting in a meeting or having dinner or talking to institutional investors  or automotive people.  All right.  Context of show in automobile.  Let's say hi to ELO.  It's ELO.  Eric?  How are you?  Hi, Eric.  How are you doing, Eric?  Mr. Logan, how are you?  Jimmy?  Pleasure to speak with you. 
[03:01:30]  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm tired, actually.  I'm very quiet.  Listen, I wanted to just, you know, let you know that I really appreciate all the help  you've given us.  We actually are applying for our Canadian license as we speak with the Canadian government.  Are you really?  Yes.  Ah, please.  Good.  You'll get it.  No, I think, you know, I think, you know, the last 15 minutes will go a long way in communicating  our support for the Canadians and, you know, how we can be in business with them.  Hence the sensitivity.  I apologize.  I wasn't being very sensitive.  Yeah, I mean, that's the 1.30 on Tuesday, so. 
[03:02:00]  1.30 on Tuesday, meeting with Canadians.  Yes.  Yeah, actually.  I'm coming with a make-believe jersey on.  If you don't mind, I'm going to extract the HR sensitivity training.  I'm just going to put Canadian sensitivity training.  I have to apologize to the prime minister, but I have to do it through a hole in a buddy  booth.  That stupid country stinks.  So, Eric, obviously, Norton has a little problem meeting with human resources and talking  about sexual harassment and sensitivity training.  I don't know.  I mean, it's just really, honestly, just company policy.  I mean, everybody has to go through it. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, you don't have to be involved.  You can just sit there and watch the videos, and there's a little test at the end of it  that you have to fill out.  A test?  You saw it, and you have to kind of, it's kind of a quiz, and they have some questions on  there that says things to the effect of, you know, it's like, you know, if somebody approached  you in the hallway and said this.  Scenarios.  I can't tell you what the questions are, obviously, but I mean, it's, you know, you get the point.  You have to kind of test out of the class because for people who don't, they have to go  back through it again because it's something that, you know, corporate America makes us do. 
[03:03:00]  Well, here's how you know I'm doing the test.  After the video of the sexual harassment, you guys can turn the lights on, and when you  see a powerful tent in the front of my pants, you'll know I passed.  Well, I...  Okay, and the answer to every question is throw her against the wall and take what's yours.  I'm sure we can work that out.  So, can we cut down...  By the way, guys, I apologize on the agenda, too.  5.30, I had checked in.  You guys are getting here on Sunday, so that was a typo on my behalf.  I apologize. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah, I was wondering about that.  And also, how come...  And I'm not trying to throw my friends in the barrel, but none of the other guys had to  go through sensitivity training.  Well, we sort of...  They did.  They came down.  I don't know where you were.  I think you were on the road or something before the show started.  I know we talked to Human Resources for a little while.  I sat in hours of meetings when we were down there.  I don't even know what they were for.  Are you telling me I actually sat through that?  I was passed out completely in the meeting.  I was...  I was...  Was that the one in the big conference room?  That was the one in the big conference room, yes.  Well...  There's no way I'm sitting in a three-hour meeting with a woman from the human... 
[03:04:00]  I can't have...  Who am I going to sexually harass?  It's all guys up here.  Well, Jimmy, I mean, look.  I mean, it's...  It's all different for three hours.  I mean, you just need to calm down.  That's what you need to do.  I'm very calm.  No, you're not.  You're out of your mind.  Am I going to look at the mule of the guy who runs the Broadway channel in the restroom?  What am I going to do?  Jimmy, it's...  I'm being sensitive.  Jimmy, it's only three hours at the most.  I mean, again, you know, I will cut some of the stuff out.  I may try to get you out of here by 4, and you can catch the 410, and you can be back  in New York by 7, 730.  Can't happen.  Well, what can happen, though, is she can come here. 
[03:04:30]  She's more than welcome to come here and follow me around while I do my spots and wait in the  car for me, and then I can talk to her as I'm driving from the cellar to stay up in New York.  All right, well, you know what, Jimmy?  We should talk offline, because, I mean, you and I really have to hammer this out.  I mean, this is just...  I mean, it's something that has to happen.  I mean, everybody goes through this.  Not happening.  It's got to happen.  Can't happen.  Why not?  Because I don't subscribe to it.  I think it's more thought policing, and I think that the guilty should be fired immediately,  and I'm guilty of nothing, and I don't sexually harass people. 
[03:05:00]  I'm a pig on the air, and I'm a pig off the air, but not in the office.  I ignore everybody in the office.  What's the whole sensitivity training as far as Norton goes?  Well, I mean, really what it is is just to kind of understand where personal boundaries  are and what's considered over the line, and it's not as much about content on the show.  It's just behavior in the corporate workplace, and since we want to get you guys more integrated  down here, as you know, Jimmy, and bring it down, we just need to make sure we're really  clear about where the lines are.  I mean, we've had people go through this, and we're launching the Baseball Channel, and 
[03:05:30]  we're putting our baseball athletes, you know, Kevin Kennedy's going through this, and we're  all going to do it.  Are they going to sit down for sensitivity training?  Of course.  So people know that they shouldn't shoot steroids and then be a hero to children?  Maybe they could sit in a meeting with him.  Me and Giambi could sit there and chit-chat for a little while.  And I'll tell you where the line is.  It's right under my belt, and it's in the form of a zipper, and I'll take it out and show  any gal who wants to see it.  I mean, you're making my point, Jim.  I mean, I understand your angst about this, but... 
[03:06:00]  It's not even angst.  I'm a gentleman off the air.  Of course he is.  I treat people respectfully, and I will not be put through any type of silly corporate  training when I've done nothing to merit it except be a fine fellow.  I just want to be able to tape this meeting and throw it on the air.  There's no way I'm leaving after everybody else.  It's an impossibility.  I don't know.  I mean, we can tape it, Opie.  I mean, it's a great idea.  I mean, it'd probably be a good thing for everybody to kind of understand.  I mean, it's not as bad as you think it is.  It really is not.  It's horrendous on every level.  I'm giving up two nights of stand-up to be down there to begin with, which I can't afford 
[03:06:30]  to because I'm trying to make a tape for The Tonight Show.  I'm not going to give up three more hours, get on a train later, and then come home by  myself like an ass because I was talking to some lady who's got shorter hair than most  ladies should in human resources.  Well, you know, you guys can discuss this, but I have a problem with the number of meetings  that we're in.  Well, listen, and also just understand something. 
[03:07:00]  I know I got a message from Ben about the Ram dinner that night with the 15 people.  Everybody who's coming, even though it says 30 people, it's broken out into markets.  So we will have, you know, that'll be done within two hours for sure.  You do understand you're saying the word hours.  Yeah.  No, I know.  You have 60 minutes.  So it's like 120, possibly 140, 145 minutes if you want to go by the minute.  I just thought we'd just do hours.  Will you go to that, Jimmy?  Yeah, dinner.  Of course.  I'll eat.  And then maybe we could cover the sensitivity training.  Maybe I could just stand naked and Gloria Allred could come in and point at my genitals 
[03:07:30]  and go dirty, dirty, dirty.  Could happen.  Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  You know I love you, right?  And it's very mutual.  I mean, seriously.  You know I love you.  Yes, and I'm very fond of you.  Okay.  And you know that there's no way in hell I'd make you sit through three hours of sensitivity training.  No, of course not, because I'll be on the train or I'll be in New York.  I'll be in New York.  Opie, you can tell him.  He so got you.  Ah! 
[03:08:00]  Oh.  He so got you.  Oh.  I sat in my office yesterday.  Oh.  And we, and because, because Jimmy was like, what are we doing?  What are we doing?  What the hell?  I'll make an agenda.  We so got him.  Oh, my God.  You, do you, do you know, and I'm going to be really honest with you, I was, at first  I'm like, this is a joke.  I was, I was sure it was a joke.  I'm walking home yesterday and I'm like, this is not a joke.  This is, because corporate America is so, you, I got to, God, damn it. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, you really nailed me.  Bravo, Elo.  When I put, when I put break and I put free time on there, I said, I screwed up.  I said, they're going to see right there.  We got the, we got the king, man.  We got the king.  But that was, it was, that was so, well, I really, and the explanation, what you were  just saying on the thing, I mean, I didn't want to yell at you because, A, I like you,  but, you know, more importantly, you can fire me.  You're my boss.  But I'm like, this son of a bitch is really going to put me through this. 
[03:09:00]  Wow.  You know, I'd love nothing more to get the tapes and just go through it with this.  Oh, yeah.  That would be, I mean, I actually would be a great thing.  Honestly, here's the deal.  When this came in yesterday from Ben, Ben was in on the gag with Elo.  I was had.  I was definitely had all day yesterday.  I was had.  Anthony was had.  And then Ben let me in on it last night.  And then I started feeling guilty because I know how Norton obsesses about things.  I'm like, this is a fun gag, and we'll get him bad.  We'll smash him really good. 
[03:09:30]  But I know he'll spend all night.  That's probably why he didn't sleep, by the way, if I know you a little bit.  I heard you say that this morning.  I felt really bad.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Elo, I guarantee you obsessed about this all day long.  I thought about it yesterday.  I didn't think about it at night.  I was too depressed about my sexual addiction.  But you got me, and I deserved it because I'm a creep.  But I'm like, this is about things I've said on the show.  They're worried I'm going to do something in the office.  You really nailed my stupid, fat face.  Good one.  Oh, that was a good one.  And herky-jerky Ben got your back because he was in on it from the beginning.  Bravo, Elo. 
[03:10:00]  This was a good one.  I had to do something.  You really got to be fun.  You guys come down here.  I promise you there's no hours of meetings.  We're going to have a great time and do a couple things and get you guys out of here.  That was brilliantly.  The break things were, that was the only error because the other stuff was so brilliantly worded.  It was hysterical.  It was 15 minutes for free time.  And the cat yesterday was like, because you were asking whether you could take your dump,  and the guy was like, hey, lighten up.  You got two 15 minutes for free time.  Were you guys just all sitting around in Washington just laughing hysterically in an office somewhere 
[03:10:30]  as we're losing our minds up here?  Actually, you know, the funny part about the whole ram dinner, I mean, there is no ram dinner.  I mean, the dinner is going to be us jerking off at an Irish pub getting hammered.  I mean, that's what it's going to be.  Right, right.  Son of a bitch.  But anyway, so Brian Shea and Dan Murphy and all the guys that run all the circuit cities  and best buys and clients, all the rams, which are the regional area managers all across the  country, all were listening to the show.  They all called him in a fit of rage and panic yesterday going, what are we presenting? 
[03:11:00]  We didn't even know we had to be here.  So they had no idea either.  Got those dim wits, too.  I think Anthony was suspicious the whole time.  No, I was suspicious at first, not even at first, not at first, at first I bought it.  Then as I looked at it more, I'm like, there's no way this could be real.  And then as I remembered some of the stuff that's gone on in the corporate world, I was  like, oh my God, this is true.  So yeah, I was completely gotten.  Do you know what helped sell me?  And it was a little thing.  It was when I said you text messaged him and said, oh, stop being babies.  It's one day at work. 
[03:11:30]  And that was such, yesterday you said he said that on the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was such a boss thing to say.  Oh, no, that was just one day, guys.  Right, right.  That was a listener, actually.  I thought it was Eric Logan.  Oh, no, no, no.  For some reason, I misinterpreted that as Logan.  And that solved it.  No, because I didn't know until last night when I was getting ready to crash.  Yeah, Opie figured that and called me.  Well, no.  At 8.30, right?  My text message was, I hate your guts.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  I go, we're never gotten.  And then I'm like, well, we won't tell Jim because we'll have fun tomorrow with this. 
[03:12:00]  That is really funny.  Hey, by the way, what is institutional shareholder?  Yeah, shareholder.  But, you know, basically, Joe Utenauer, who's our CFO, you know, manages all the big funds  like Legg Mason and T. Roy Price and all those folks that actually have a large amount of  stock in the company.  So, they often ask questions about where we're going and stuff.  So, it's not unusual for us to do, you know, investor meetings and stuff like that.  Ah, there's the memo.  The schedule being ripped up. 
[03:12:30]  Very good, Eric.  Yeah.  That was very good.  That was written up.  Those little things were written up so well.  That was, because it's like, we're not dumb.  And it's like, God damn it, this is for real.  We thought it was a goof and then like, no, this is real.  It was worded the way they actually word things.  But, I mean, that would be, honestly, I mean, the thing about it is that that would not be  an uncommon day at XM.  Right.  That's why it sold so well is because I looked at it going, no, this is what they deal with  on a daily basis.  Yeah.  I mean, it's meetings and meetings and meetings.  And, yeah, I mean, it's what it is. 
[03:13:00]  And I think Opie said it with XM, you know, extreme meetings.  Right.  Well, have you been listening to the show?  Our new intern came in today with a $2,000 three-piece suit.  Yeah.  What is the story with that?  We're calling him Mini Low.  And a Gucci belt.  Mini Low.  Yeah.  He's Mr. Little Business Guy.  Well, what size is he?  Because I'm exploding out of my suits.  I'm gaining weight at a blistering pace.  And I can send him some of my old suits.  He's a diminutive little fellow.  Oh, cool.  Let's see if we can.  All right, guys. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  All right, Eric.  Good one, man.  You guys have a good day.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Bye, Eric.  I love that.  So happy with himself that he got us.  He really, really got us.  You should have saw your face when we were telling you.  Nailed.  Priceless.  We should have freaking videotaped that.  Because he kind of was like, and I talk to him very comfortably.  He's a really good guy.  But in that moment, he's kind of in boss mode.  When he said, we'll talk about this offline, I was like, oh, no, Jimmy's going to have  to sit through this meeting on the phone now about the meeting.  Offline.  It's like, uh-oh.  That was good. 
[03:14:00]  That you're really, you're rarely gotten.  Yeah.  I got to respect that.  That was a good one.  Noah is 5'5".  Ugh.  Ugh.  He's 5'5"?  Jesus.  Looks like he got the short end of the stick.  Oh, my God.  I eat a sandwich that tall.  How much does he weigh?  He can't weigh more than $1.20, man. 
[03:14:30]  I don't want him in here.  Yeah, bring him in.  I think this kid's going to shine.  Danny's getting more and more pissed off by the mall.  He'll hang in there and so'll Babe Ruth, that stupid Yankee hat.  Noah, how much do you weigh, Noah?  I weigh about $1.25.  $1.25.  One and a quarter.  I'm surprised you didn't shave, though.  You're such a neat little diminutive man.  Maybe he did, and he's got that thing where he just grows a beard like in two seconds.  No, it's just a look.  Oh, look at him.  That's a look.  It's a rugged look.  That's four months of growth for him.  Yeah, you're right. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Thanks, Noah.  All right.  Beat it.  No problem.  All right.  Thank you.  Where's the Pat audio?  I want Pat audio.  We'll get it for tomorrow.  It'll take some time.  Oh, really?  Shannon.  What does a cow say from my neighborhood?  Moo-nocky.  Well, I'll tell you what a cow says from that neighborhood.  Sure, I'll have more eggnog.  It's too bad for all the new listeners, but that was one of the benchmark shows, our eggnog drinking contest.  A lot of these questions, by the way, because people are like, man, sometimes you guys, 
[03:15:30]  they're way too inside.  You go to whackbag.com, opianthony.net.  These guys are, you know, hardcore fans of the show, and they'll answer any of your questions.  Oh, find out yourself.  All right.  Shannon from Toronto.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Uh-oh.  Shannon?  I want to just defend my country.  I love you guys.  I love you guys since WDUF when you were on.  We got you guys over the border, and I just want to let Norton know that Canada loves Jim Norton.  Dude, I love Canada.  I was just annoyed. 
[03:16:00]  I love you, Anthony, and we can't wait.  I got the XM radio, like you said.  I got it illegally because they don't sell them here, and what can you do?  But as soon as you guys come across the border, the ONA Army is going to go in full force on this side of the border.  We love you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Shannon.  We love Canada, and now I feel all bad.  Here you go.  I've always enjoyed Canada myself.  So did I, but what are you going to do?  Tell that one caller who was trashing me, you live in a fine nation with hot chicks?  I had to smash them.  Of course you did.  Was I going to be a gentleman?  I love the Montreal Festival, sir.  Thanks for telling me I suck. 
[03:16:30]  I love your homeland.  It's you I don't really enjoy, sir.  Yeah, exactly.  Toronto's just a weird city.  They're living like it's 1962.  The fashions, and I mean, it's weird.  Is there a wall around Toronto with elders inside that put on red suits?  No?  No?  I thought maybe they were living in the past.  All right.  We'll take a very quick break, and then we're going to say hi to Dean Edwards, who's playing  Carolines this weekend.  He's back.  Oh!  And what about Ralphie Mae?  We've got to get the Ashley Simpson story out of him. 
[03:17:00]  What time did he start breakfast?  Six?  It should be.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good, but I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks. 
[03:17:30]  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  What is this?  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die against the divas.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[03:18:00]  M202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Give me film.  Give me fire.  Give me that one.  Shut it up.  All right.  That was a break.  I know.  How fast was that?  Are you insane?  Hey, let's say hi to Dean Edwards.  Get him in here.  Ben, we're going to need one more update from your drunk Boston friends about the search for 
[03:18:30]  the Chinese terrorist and the dirty bomb.  Dean Edwards is playing Caroline's this weekend, I do believe.  Right, Dean?  Yes, sir.  Looking all good in his Puma gear, man.  He's a handsome fellow.  It bugs me.  I'll say.  It's not my fault.  It's my wife's.  Oh, she dresses you?  Yes.  Did she put your clothes out in the morning?  No.  No?  It's not that bad yet, but I'm only been married a year.  Am I on?  Is this on?  Yes.  This is what we do. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, I'm sitting here chewing eggs and peaches.  We do the same thing.  We just eat on mic.  It pisses people off.  My bad.  Canada.  It's so funny.  People do hate that, too.  They do.  They hate the eating thing.  Are you?  Well, yeah.  We have no breaks.  What are we going to do?  Not eat?  I know.  Why am I talking like an old Jewish man?  What are we going to do?  Not eat?  What are we going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are we going to do?  Again, he told me to be him here.  I'm essential to the war effort.  What was? 
[03:19:30]  Yo, I saw on this list one-armed old man who was just trying to shovel on his way, and the guards  they were on a truckload somewhere, and again, I know this is a comedy show, so forgive  me, and this is funny, though, and they're on their way somewhere, and the German guards  pull them over, and they go, everybody is shoveling!  They make all these poor Jews shovel, and the one old man with one arm is trying to shovel  with one arm, and the guards laugh at him, and he knows he's about to be shot, and he  goes, I'm essential to the war effort, and they shoot him, because he wasn't. 
[03:20:00]  He was a one-armed shoveler, and it's awful, and it's very sad, and the fact that I'm  saying it, and you're laughing hysterically, and I want to laugh.  Now, was he doing it as a joke, as a last joke before he dies, because that would be  funny if he turns around and goes, I'm essential to the war effort, joking about his one-armed,  huh, I'm essential to the war effort, huh, I'm going to die anyway, so why not go out  with a bag?  No, he wasn't trying to be funny.  I'm essential, eh, well.  That's so bad.  He actually thought he was, because he was doing some job. 
[03:20:30]  And Oscar Schindler, I think, had him doing with one arm, and he was, ah.  Yeah.  Now, Dean, you were going to say something.  Was it about Canada and Jimmy?  Yeah, no, I was trying to figure out what was going on.  Did you guys get him?  I heard you say.  Oh, the whole corporate thing.  Yeah, we've got to go to Washington Broadcast Live for two days from the XM compound, and  they want us to, you know, have some more synergy with them down there.  So we got a lot of corporate meetings, and they put together an agenda, and we got Jimmy 
[03:21:00]  really bad, because they want him to sit through, like, sensitivity training for a few hours.  I don't like the language, the XM compound and an agenda.  And synergy.  Oh, I know.  I know.  It sounds like a cult, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a cult.  It's Waco, part two.  Yeah.  Bring your Nikes.  Yeah, we all castrate ourselves and go to the spaceship.  Our programming director is Marshall Whiteapple.  Marshall Whiteapple.  Marshall Whiteapple.  Wow.  I don't know how you remember these names, man. 
[03:21:30]  Because I'm garbage.  I can't remember not to pay a woman for sex, though, and find some real love and intimacy,  can I?  Fat-breasted, lonely zilch.  What were you calling the dude?  You were calling a fat 80s woman?  Oh, because what was he saying?  He was going police.  Jesus, dude.  He used Center Square in 1976.  What is that?  He was like B. Arthur with leg warmers on.  Police.  I bet he put his hand up.  Police.  Even though he was on the phone, he put his hand up.  Police.  I was just worried.  I'm like, this guy might tell me to get a life. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  I hit you with that.  That would have shown you.  Hey, we got some examples of Pat from Menaki.  Oh.  To let people in on the gas.  By the way, to explain to new listeners and to Dean.  And to Dean, who's playing Carolines all weekend long, by the way.  Yes, he is.  We had a contest to give away my five.  I hope we could drink the most eggnog.  And this guy is a bit overweight for a planetary thing.  And he drank, what, 50 double shots of eggnog and then something like that.  But he has a lot of, he's a funny guy and he told a lot of jokes.  He was the last to throw up and this is how it sounded when he finally released the eggnog. 
[03:22:30]  This is really him.  How's eggnog chunky?  Why is there feta cheese in his eggnog?  Pieces of his spleen from the looks of him throwing up.  It was awful.  It was a license plate and a few other things.  A little Kittner boy.  He was just power booting.  Robert Shaw's leg. 
[03:23:00]  Let's drink to your bad joke.  Not only did he.  He rubble, that's what it was.  Gurgle, gurgle.  But he was cool under pressure, though.  He's like, you know what?  I better throw up.  And he puts his, he was diabetic.  And Ope is just like, go ahead, more.  I'm like, it's obsessive.  You're killing him, but it's good.  It's a good gag.  Yeah.  So in between drinking all this eggnog, he was throwing out really bad one-liners.  Oh, okay. 
[03:23:30]  So, and then these guys have been imitating him all morning long.  He's one of these jolly fat guys who's constantly trying to get acceptance by making these jokes,  and they just never work.  They're really bad.  And so he tells them, and he'll add like a, kind of facial expression.  You know, like the.  Very, very bossy.  Jolly red cheek.  Very rich fat guy.  Yeah.  You know how to.  He's like Voss with more dignity. 
[03:24:00]  But he has, here's the thing with Pat.  I think it's rosacea.  Yeah, so his cheeks are so red and rosy.  Which I now think is from him doing jokes and people going, look, I'm done listening to your jokes.  Shut up.  Shut up, stupid.  But we really like Pat.  I know we don't sound like we do, but we really like him.  Do you have a couple of clips of him?  I've been dining here.  All right, let's listen.  Here's Pat.  She spilled my eggnog.  Just every minute.  Whoa.  Joking about the PSA.  Piling up my thing.  Doing a little PSA joke. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  And we had, you know, goofed on the PSA like 20 times before he did it.  So it was like he was fifth in line with the same joke.  Here's another example.  Oh, really?  I'm just starting.  No, just starting to drink.  Right, right.  That's really a tough one.  Just starting.  Just starting to drink.  That'll be your old week.  Pizzas.  Yeah, he's got a John Candy quality to him.  No, he does.  Well, yeah, without any humor.  Right, exactly.  John Candy now. 
[03:25:00]  With a touch of Mr. Magoo.  He has a John Candy humor from JFK.  You got the right ta-ta, but the wrong ho-ho.  Vomit.  Good day to you, sir.  Here's another example.  More!  More!  What?  Screaming more, yeah.  More eggnog.  Oh, yeah.  And then one more?  I'm thinking, can't wait for breakfast. 
[03:25:30]  I'm thinking, it's like, oh, what's he thinking?  He's full?  He's had enough eggnog?  He's been drinking a lot?  What?  I have breakfast.  I really wish he was here.  What a jolly old...  Where's he from?  He's from up here?  From Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Munaki.  Miyaki?  Munaki.  He lives in a...  Which is kind of like Bukkake.  Having that on your face is more pleasant than listening to those lines.  Oh, I have. 
[03:26:00]  Another one.  Liner.  Oh, Bat from Munaki.  You've done it again.  Oh, hey.  Anthony, shifting gears, we've been talking about Mayor Menino from Boston.  Have you heard this story yet, Dean?  No, no, no.  There's the front page of the Post.  We're looking for four Chinese nationals.  Me need no more eggnog. 
[03:26:30]  It's a big story.  There may be a dirty bomb somewhere in the United States.  A dirty bomb?  That'd be Pat telling jokes in the mud.  They're Chinese?  I won't be ordering any Japanese food.  Dean gets it.  I love it.  Oh, my goo.  Oh, my goo.  Miyaki.  So, where's Ben?  We've got to get to the last update. 
[03:27:00]  Ben, one of our producers, Dean, he's from Boston, and he knows everything that's going  on in Boston.  And this morning, the story broke.  It's on the front page of the paper.  We're looking for the dirty bomb.  These four Chinese people.  Yes.  And Ben's in the back office going that his friends are already looking for the terrorists  in the Boston area.  Yeah.  And his drunk friends are already looking for these people.  His drunk, racist friends in Boston are out like in a mob looking for Asians to beat  up now.  This is an old school mob.  They have pitchforks and burns.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  That's how they are up there.  Nice.  Go get them.  Come on.  So, Ben, what is the...  What's the update?  What's the update?  I think they're passed out.  I just tried calling them.  Of course they are.  A bunch of drunks.  So, they're very effective.  Yeah.  I just tried to call them to get them on the air and no answer.  They're totally shit-faced.  Of course they are.  Let's beat them up, dude.  Let's get the baseball bats.  So, yeah.  Ben's like, if they find these four, they're going to be dead before the FBI gets to them.  No, they won't.  They'll fall asleep.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:28:00]  We're going to...  Hold on.  Let me take them now.  Delta Force are all passed out with cartoons playing in the background.  Drunken Northeastern sots.  Yeah, we'll get them tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  We'll get them tomorrow.  Go Pats.  So, we got...  Shut up.  We got a couple clips from Menino's press conference, Anthony.  All right.  Three short clips.  All that mumbles.  I've asked our public safety agencies to take appropriate measures to heighten awareness.  To heighten awareness of the dirty bomb.  There's a dirty bomb in our fine city. 
[03:28:30]  Shut up.  This guy, is it true he's not running again?  I think this is it for the...  Finally.  Finally.  The good old mayor of Boston.  Give someone else a shot.  How many years has he been in?  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  We left...  It's like a pope.  Forever.  Forever.  We left almost seven years ago.  And he was the mayor then.  Seven years.  Seven years.  So, here's another clip from Mayor Menino.  We have information from one single enormous source.  One single enormous source. 
[03:29:00]  Pat from Menonci.  There it is.  We are.  Wait, there's a dirty bomb.  Headed from Boston.  Terrorism.  Watch it.  Terrorist coming.  It's called terrorism, not terrorism.  He's the worst public speaker.  He's the worst.  God, that's funny.  One enormous source.  One enormous source.  What, your tongue?  That big fat piece of meat you can't keep in your mouth?  Your stuttering, muttering prick-yaya. 
[03:29:30]  Stuttering, muttering prick-yaya.  One more click here.  Oh.  You know, the problem we have is there's a lot of misinformation out there.  There's been no issue to me from any authorities about dirty bombs or LNG tankers.  I think we should go with the facts.  Is he reading?  Is someone handing him Post-its as he reads?  It sounds like it.  I couldn't understand.  What was that word he said at the beginning of that?  We can play it again. 
[03:30:00]  We've been goofing on this guy, Dean, forever.  We've come to the conclusion he just has a really oversized, thick tongue.  He's the guy that got inspired from our radio job up in Boston, by the way.  Oh, really?  We had inadvertently announced that he had died in a car wreck up in Boston on April Fool's.  Why would he take that?  He took it a little personally.  It could have been blown over, but he made a huge stink about it.  Got on the news.  Was talking about how awful we were and how we needed to be fired or else the station was going to pay.  So they threw us out. 
[03:30:30]  Threw us out of Boston, Mass.  What's that word he says?  The problem we have is there's a lot of misinformation out there.  There's been no issue to me from any authorities about dirty bombs or LNG tankers.  I think we should go with the facts.  He's probably said there's been nothing issued to me or something.  Is it issue or he was asking a question?  It's true.  I just want to assure the public that Ben's drunken friends are out in Foss looking for these terrorists with a dirty bomb. 
[03:31:00]  And for some reason, Chester has been kicked in the liver and we think the terrorists are responsible.  Don't you feel safer knowing he's on top of things up there?  Jesus Christ, no wonder those...  You sound like him.  I know.  I can't even talk now.  I suck.  His tongue is infected.  He's saying no wonder the terrorists came out of the airport up there, Logan, and crashed their planes there.  They're just walking into that place. 
[03:31:30]  I wouldn't be surprised if they are headed there with a dirty bomb.  Nathaniel put this little post-it here five minutes after we were talking about it, but I think it was still a lot of time.  He said, the big source, Ben's Bulge.  Ah!  That was Nathaniel.  Wow.  Now, from now on, the only intern that is allowed to bring post-its into me is Noah.  Noah.  You're going to get this kid killed.  Noah looked good, man. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, he's dressed.  But he's our intern.  Look at how we dress and our intern is outdressing us.  When I first walked in, like, I tried not to, and I said, why?  Yeah.  Well, I said, are you just sitting in?  Do you own XM, perhaps?  Here's the thing.  That's the boy I like.  Look back there.  They look like all the guys that were murdered and bullied.  Well, there was only one guy murdered and bullied.  They were the ones that killed him.  Maybe I should...  Oh!  Oh, wow.  That's just stinky.  I just... 
[03:32:30]  Look at Noah's modeling.  Do you see his hands?  Look at how he's standing.  Hands on hips.  Is this JT Penny look or what, man?  He should be throwing a football.  Everything he's doing is stylish, man.  He just turned away, wiped his nose smoothly.  What kind of watch is that, son?  A diesel watch.  A diesel watch.  Diesel.  Dude is stylish.  He's got a nice suit for the little diesel watch to show the girls.  He has to have a contest.  Who wants to date Noah?  I win.  What kind of watches do you like? 
[03:33:00]  Diesel do.  Or don't.  Well...  I like to watch a mirror when I'm eating.  Breakfast!  Hey, watch.  Watch the puke come out of my mouth.  Little fat fingers in his throat.  What?  Why are you dragging this kid out?  I like him.  You want to drag one of them to do some things with this kid's things?  So, why is he on mic? 
[03:33:30]  I don't know.  He's got the headphones on and everything.  You're really ready to go, aren't you, son?  He's ready to go.  Why don't you just push Anthony over a little bit and start...  He's always prepared.  His subliminal egos, I've been waiting for this moment forever.  Opie and Anthony, I will overthrow you!  Say something stupid.  Sound effects.  I don't have much to say.  You're a broadcast major.  Say something.  Say something.  Is he really?  What did you learn?  I'll take you up on the offer on that dating thing.  Oh, not me.  I'm married, man. 
[03:34:00]  Easy.  Easy.  No, you said for people to...  Oh, I don't know.  Shoot, look at that.  I'm here for 30 minutes, man.  What, you want to go out on a date?  Sure.  Yeah?  I mean, he brought up the offer.  I thought it was a good idea.  What type of chick do you admire?  Um...  You like to go biddies, man?  You like to take old biddies?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let's ask a question.  Too much like Jim, huh?  How far...  Do we have...  Well, excuse me.  Hold on. 
[03:34:30]  I want to know if young Danny just implied that I have fat titties.  He really did.  I really hurt, Danny.  He's getting a little too confident, I think.  I know.  He just did.  Hand in his pockets, unshaven, looking good, goddammit.  All right.  I was wondering if maybe Tracy Morgan was in studio today.  I don't know if he is.  Yo, I want Noah to go on a date with a black woman.  No, you need some black in you.  I want a black woman to sodomize him.  Or be sodomized.  You can be the sodomy or the sodomer.  But do the sodomy, not the rod of me. 
[03:35:00]  I think I'll pass on that.  Listen.  Listen.  We're going to find you a date.  We need to bring you to some of them strip clubs up in the Bronx.  Like the goat.  The goat was old school.  That's where you could, you know, walk in, tip a girl a dollar, and stick a pinky in a  boot shoe.  That's the chocolate starfish.  Am I dressed right for that?  You're dressed however you want to dress.  You're effervescent, Noah.  Don't ever let them tell you any different. 
[03:35:30]  Flying high, sky stratosphere over LaGuardia.  Because I don't like JFK.  He's got Tracy's eyes.  That's Tracy's target, man.  That's really scary, man.  That's funny.  You're awesome.  Noah, I love you.  Thank you.  I love you.  I appreciate it.  Dude, Tracy will stare at you until you feel uncomfortable.  Yeah.  First time, I love you.  Five minutes later, you've walked away.  You're across the room.  He's still looking at you, mouthing. 
[03:36:00]  Dude, we had a celebrity softball game, and Tracy Morgan showed up at Jim Brewer, and Tracy  decided to get completely, well, not completely naked.  Did he have a jockstrap on?  He had, like, a small bikini underwear.  Really tiny underwear, and just walks out onto the field.  That's it.  That's it, with his big gut hanging out, and he just didn't care.  Tracy has no shame.  Oh, he's got stretch marks down his side and everything.  We had 6,000 people there.  I'm like, this guy's got balls.  Tracy does not care, baby.  And then he wanted to take us all on a field trip through Harlem or the Bronx or whatever. 
[03:36:30]  We've got to see where I used to live.  He's my old stomping crown.  There goes Welfare Fred, man.  He's awesome.  He hangs out.  He's there from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.  He works a 12-hour ship.  Then crackhead Susie comes out and takes over.  I love her, too.  Spectacular.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I don't care what anybody says.  I love O&A. 
[03:37:00]  Noah, anything?  You want to be a broadcast journalist?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  How do you deal with someone?  Noah, how would you deal with someone like if Tracy came in and he's like, Noah, someone's  popping.  Popping.  We're ready to do an interview.  Let's go.  Come on.  I got 10 minutes.  What would I say?  Quicker.  What would I say?  Yes.  Take your hand off your hip.  Yeah.  He'd call his dad and have him do it.  Wow.  Danny just doesn't like Noah.  He's a little teapot, short and stout. 
[03:37:30]  There is his hand on the tricep.  Look at both the same.  Zip and here goes his mouth.  He's like the bizarro version of Noah.  He's like the clean cut versus the evil version.  Yeah.  He's got the evil goatee, too, right?  Damn it.  I missed something good.  I know.  I missed something really good.  Damn it.  I hate that.  Listen on the replay.  I will.  Very funny, Jimmy.  All right.  Noah, you got nothing.  Nothing.  Now he's standing like Nixon.  He's got his arms crossed in his suit.  I am not a homer. 
[03:38:00]  He's a young Republican.  Look at him.  Not a Republican.  You didn't have no way.  And Liddy pulled my fly dog.  And then he zipped it up.  All right, Noah.  Thank you, Noah.  You're welcome.  Very good.  When are you coming in next?  I come in on Monday.  You can be whatever you want, kid.  You got pizzazz.  Thank you.  What year are you in in school?  I'm a senior.  A senior at NYU.  Graduating. 
[03:38:30]  You've been there for the whole time?  Four years.  So you're ready to graduate now.  You've learned everything you're pretty much going to learn.  I don't think I've learned too much.  No?  Nah.  They didn't teach you about broadcasting?  Nah, not much.  No?  But I hope they don't hear this.  Noah, not good to say when you're interning here.  Did you see the Olsen twins at NYU?  I have not seen them.  Did you see anyone jump from the roofs?  Know anyone that jumped?  Ooh, I didn't know anybody, but I heard a lot about it.  Wow, you're going more in this business, kid.  Yeah, do you ever look out the window and see an expressionless face falling by you with a math book? 
[03:39:00]  I don't think I want to see that.  No Asian person plummeting from the roof?  Thrown off by some drunk Boston friends?  Why is your face all red?  What's the matter?  Don't be nervous.  We're all just joking.  Eh, we're just having fun.  A bunch of men checking you out in a suit.  Yo, is that the Subaru logo on your belt?  That's Gucci.  That's Gucci, bro.  That's Gucci, yo.  Come on.  Hey, babe. 
[03:39:30]  My bad.  I wear Sean John.  That's it.  Doesn't it look like the Subaru logo?  That's hilarious.  I'm not a walking car ad.  There you go.  You look very comfortable.  Thank you.  As he poses like Superman.  Here is my handle.  Here is my...  Oh, I'm a sugar bowl.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, great.  Thanks.  All right.  There you go.  As Eric's waving him off. 
[03:40:00]  All right.  Danny, get the door for Noah, please.  Wow.  You're going to get this kid beat up.  Oh, shit.  The wrestling interns are the real deal, man.  That is hilarious.  Are we going to ever do that?  Yeah.  I don't know if we have time now.  Yeah.  What?  We want to play Guess What's in My Pants.  She's been sitting there so long.  You want to do a speed Guess What's in My Pants?  We'll do it real quick.  Hey, Rebecca from North Carolina.  Yeah.  Rebecca, hi.  How old are you?  19.  What do you look like? 
[03:40:30]  Well, I've got auburn hair, green eyes.  I'm about 5'4".  You're from North Carolina.  Actually, I'm from Virginia.  All right.  Great.  How much do you weigh?  About 120.  120?  Are you in your car?  No, actually.  I'm with my fiancee in a tractor trailer.  All right.  And what are you wearing today?  Right now, I'm not wearing a damn thing.  Not wearing a damn thing.  We enjoy that.  Okay.  We're going to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Here are the rules to the game.  You take the phone. 
[03:41:00]  You rub it on the most intimate of areas.  Right?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  And you will rub it up and down, side to side, in a circular fashion.  We will then, based on the sounds we hear, try to decide what type of hairstyle you have.  Is it the regular standard issue girl triangle?  Is it a landing strip, or mohawk as we like to call it?  Is it the Hitler mustache, which is, well, a Hitler mustache?  Or is it the clean-shaved, wood floor, JonBenet Ramsey, or as we like to call it, the Conor Peterson armpit? 
[03:41:30]  Don't tell us.  Don't give us any hints or clues or anything until we ask, what's in your pants?  Okay, Rebecca, you understand the rules?  Yeah.  Here's the theme song.  Hit it.  That is the edited version of the song.  Rebecca, if you will, please, in an up-and-down fashion, let's listen closely.  All right.  All right.  Please, side to side. 
[03:42:00]  And now circular motion.  Okay, my guess is wood floor, Opie.  Come on, Opie.  I'm sorry.  I'll just...  Landing strip.  Landing strip?  Clean-shaven.  Clean-shaven wood floor?  I'm going to guess inside of a cat box by those noises.  No, I'm going to go with a mohawk.  Mohawk?  One more guess from Tracy Morgan.  Yo, I think she's...  I love her labia.  I love everything she's holding down there.  Chris Rock?  Will Chris Rock guess?  She's naked! 
[03:42:30]  Anybody else want to guess that lives in your head?  Denzel Washington would say she is clean-shaven.  All right.  I'm going to say a little kitty cat in there.  Rebecca, what is in your pants?  A landing strip.  Jimmy Norton said mohawk.  Rebecca, thank you so much for playing Gus with my pants.  Cue the music. 
[03:43:00]  My pants.  I can't believe we got that off so fast.  It's like under a minute.  That was a quick one.  It was a steamer.  Oh, and look at that.  We got to give out plugs.  Got to give out plugs.  Yes.  I will be...  No, I'm kidding.  Dean Edwards tonight.  Tonight, you Sunday.  At Caroline's.  212-757-4100, right?  4100, yes.  Or carolines.com.  If you want to check out some of my stuff I've done, check out deenedwards.net.  Let me know what you think, man.  Very funny stand-up comic.  Brilliant impressionist. 
[03:43:30]  Who you work with, do you know?  Mark Theobald and Harris Dane.  And Pat from Monarchy.  Okay, perhaps...  And Pat's going to make an appearance.  Dean is handsome, and he has perhaps the two ugliest openers on the planet.  Mark Theobald looks like something that swims around the Titanic wreckage that they can  only see with infrared lighting.  Wow!  Whether you see Mark Theobald...  Just go to the show, and you're going to love Harris if you've ever...  He's CJ from The Soldier Story.  Oh, God, that movie is great. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, that's funny.  That's a good show, though, man.  Yeah, it should be hot.  We did our thing last night.  We have four more shows.  It's going to be hot.  Caroline's on Broadway, deenedwards.net.  Check it out, man.  It's going to be hot.  Take fun.  I'll be opening my mouth.  Oh, oh!  Well, you know, because I'm...  Good guy.  I also want to thank Donnie Deutsch for stopping in today. 
[03:44:30]  He was great for us.  Yes.  We want to make him a regular.  His new show debuts on CNBC this coming Monday.  Monday.  It's called The Big Idea, and we're going to be on I don't know when yet.  They haven't really scheduled our interview yet.  10 p.m. is on, right?  I believe so.  I think he's going to do all right with that.  Check it out.  And, Noah, thanks for all the fodder today.  Yes.  Very good.  Noah, you're hilarious.  Hilarious.  I love you.  We look forward to your next outfit on Monday.  You want to get on the mic for a second?  I want to ask you.
