<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from the World Poker Tour Invitational at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles was a chaotic and highly irreverent affair, plagued by technical difficulties throughout.  The broadcast began with the hosts recounting their tumultuous arrival in Los Angeles, including getting lost in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood amidst heavy rain and mudslides, and noting a recent tiger sighting in the hills (which was subsequently shot).  The show's location was described as a somewhat seedy area with unusual gambling regulations, allowing strip clubs but prohibiting traditional casino games.

Significant technical issues, particularly with Anthony's headset and Jim Norton's microphone, were a recurring theme.  Despite these problems,  the show featured a star-studded lineup.  Impromptu interviews included Rich Voss (a writer for Chris Rock), who excitedly announced his recent unconventional engagement, and Deacon Jones (former NFL player), whose appearances were marked by nervousness, irritation at the technical issues, and increasingly vulgar boasts about his sexual prowess and penis size, ultimately culminating in a near-genital exposure and his departure from the show.  Kelly Packard (actress from *Baywatch* and *Ripley's Believe It or Not*) discussed her poker skills and compared them to her acting career.  David Stein from World Poker Radio discussed the evolution of televised poker, and Rossi Morreale from *Junkyard Mega Wars* made a brief appearance.  The hosts also spoke at length with Ed Asner, who engaged in a heated, expletive-laden exchange before leaving.  Dean Cain also appeared, discussing his career and poker experiences.  A lengthy conversation with professional poker player Daniel Negraneau included details of his career, recent $4.5 million win, and recent breakup.  Jennifer Tilly also joined the show during a break from the tournament.

The hosts spent considerable time discussing Anthony Cumia's participation in the poker tournament, focusing on his anxiety and his self-described strategy ("check, fold, and drink").  Their commentary was often punctuated by crude jokes and off-color tangents about the attractive women present and the unusual bulge of one player.   The show included numerous celebrity guests or mentions, including Joe Rogan (who called in and recounted a story about Doug Stanhope's DMT experience and played a recording of a song by "Gangsta Fag"),  Rob Schneider, Mina Suvari, Sean Fanning, Skeet Ulrich, James Woods, Ray Romano, Gabe Kaplan, Brad Garrett, Ed Asner, Jennifer Tilly, Jon Favreau (who briefly discussed Colin Quinn’s poker skills), Macaulay Culkin, Lou Diamond Phillips, members of No Doubt, Vince Van Patten, Cameron Manheim, and a Stephen Lynch song about "Special Ed" was played. The hosts frequently digressed into discussions of other celebrities, pornography (including a planned golden shower scene), and extreme body modification.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion about the state of modern comedy compared to older sitcoms like *Sanford and Son* and *All in the Family*, and an extensive discussion about the 2004 Democratic primary and Howard Dean's infamous scream.  A heated debate about joke-stealing in the comedy world was sparked by Jim Norton's encounter with Buddy Hackett.  Other topics included the declining health of Muhammad Ali (discussed with insensitive humor), a description of Joe Rogan being choked out by Tito Ortiz in 12 seconds, a detailed comparison of various martial arts styles, and a concluding segment on a sneaker riot reported in the New York Post.  Throughout the show, the hosts' frequent use of profanity and sexually suggestive comments was a constant element.  The show concluded with the hosts making plans for their post-broadcast activities and referencing Richard Pryor.

But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  All right.  Take your time.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  How long is this song?  How long is this song?  It's an instrumental.  I think we're broadcasting live at this point, though.  I'm not really sure.  We're trying to get Anthony with a headset.  We're trying to get the prima donna his headset.  See, he can't talk back, so we can say whatever the hell we want.  Anthony's trying to talk, but we can't hear him yet.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus spreading across America, and we have gone west.  We are in Los Angeles, somewhere in the ghetto at the World Poker Tournament. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, is that getting better?  I don't hear you.  Yeah, I don't hear him at all.  Not in my headset.  All right.  Everyone is panicking behind the scenes.  Everyone is completely panicking.  What happened?  Norton is freaking out.  Well, it's the Opie program.  Going back to the old days.  I'm going to spin some two-furs.  There we go.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you? 
[00:06:00]  I had to take Jimmy's mic.  Welcome to the broadcast.  Well, yes.  It smells like urine.  It's not Norton and Friends or anything like that.  I don't know what happened.  There's a massive wire.  This is good.  When you actually go on the air, five minutes before we went on, we were all just like hanging  out and scrambling around.  We didn't even check anything.  We should have been here hours early making sure everything's at worst, but of course not.  I'm getting attacked by the wires.  I'm going to get choked out here.  There is a hell of a spiderweb behind your head of just wires, headphones and microphones 
[00:06:30]  and everything else, but apparently we're on the air.  And Jimmy's not, and Jimmy's losing his mind.  We're here at the World Poker Tour Invitational at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles.  Yeah.  And I just registered, Opie.  I know.  You look very nervous today, I've got to tell you.  I'm a little nerve-wracked.  I've known Anthony for about ten years, and you look very nervous.  Well, that's my strategy.  People are going to go, ooh, what a poker face he's got.  It's called Scared Shitless.  That's the look he's got, and I'm going with it.  I'm sticking with it. 
[00:07:00]  I think you thought it was no big deal until we got here and realized, oh my God, look at  all these lights.  I mean, there's TV lights, there's TV cameras, there's paparazzi, there's a red carpet.  Well, it's set up.  There's a celebrity list that has at least 50 to 60 names on it.  There's like, how many tables out there?  20, 30 tables?  Yeah, there's about 30 or so.  We can't hear you, Kenny.  We're still setting up microphones.  I'm going to be pretty close to us right there.  I'm table 14, which is very close to where we're broadcasting over here. 
[00:07:30]  We're broadcasting.  If you ever watch the World Poker Tour, they have the final table set up.  Of course, no one's going to be playing on it today because all the preliminaries go  on today, but all the cameras are around it.  It's just like I see it on TV and everything.  We're broadcasting from right in front of the final table.  And then beyond the final table on the other side is like a ballroom, and it's just full  of about, yeah, 30 or 40 poker tables, of which I'm at table 14.  Do you know who else is at your table?  Not yet. 
[00:08:00]  I have no idea who's at my table yet.  I'm hoping it's people that are very bad at poker.  That would be very good for me.  But with my luck, Doyle Brunson will sit down there, and I'll be done in a matter of minutes.  Oh, look who just walked in, Rich Voss.  Hey, Rich, how are you?  Wow, the celebrities are rolling in now.  If only we had microphones to put on so we could hear them speak.  Wow, we have the best booker in the business.  Rich Voss has arrived for his exclusive interview with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:08:30]  The first celebrity we gaze at is Voss.  Voss.  Anyway, so, yeah, I mean, this casino's in the middle of the ghetto.  I don't know.  Is it?  Huh?  Should we be saying that?  Well, it's in the ghetto, right?  It's right off the I-5 freeway.  Hey, man, if you're going to build a casino, wouldn't you find the cheap real estate?  Well, true.  All right.  Well, you know, Atlantic City, by the way, Opie, is built in a very bad part of town. 
[00:09:00]  Atlantic City, the casinos are built in a very bad part of town.  But once you're there, it's fine.  You're in your own little land.  And that's what this is.  You know, it's a lovely casino.  Who knows what's going on outside the building?  Who really cares?  Well, we kind of knew what was going on outside the building.  Because on the way from the Sofitel, we got lost.  Yeah.  And we decided to just pull over.  Look at Ben panicking because I mentioned the hotel we're at in Los Angeles.  Yeah.  Because, man, they're going to just be beating down our door to meet us. 
[00:09:30]  Ben's just freaking out.  I wish we had microphones to get everyone else on.  We will eventually.  I know.  Hopefully we will.  So we pull off the highway and we take an exit ramp.  And all of a sudden, we're at like a bodega.  And Kenny jumps out of the van to ask for directions.  And I'm like, are you insane?  Did you guys notice like two miles back that everything changed into Spanish?  All of a sudden, there was no English language signs anywhere to be found.  The billboards were in Spanish.  All the storefronts were in Spanish.  And that's when we figured maybe we were lost.  Maybe.  And, yeah, Kenny pulled in. 
[00:10:00]  Kenny's our driver now, too.  Yeah.  What happened to that?  Didn't we used to have like a van with a driver that would pick us up?  Why is Kenny driving us around?  He's our chauffeur.  He, I don't know.  He pretty much rented the van.  He's got like a sporty suit on and everything.  He looks very professional.  He's our driver, our security.  It was quite an adventure to get over here.  But Los Angeles, man, they're talking about this rain like, I don't know.  Dude, it's all they talk about on the news.  I'm trying to watch the news. 
[00:10:30]  Like Armageddon hit or something.  Yeah, I'm trying to watch the news.  And all they're talking about is this goddamn rain and the mudslides.  And they keep showing that poor statue that fell off the back patio that was hanging over a cliff.  And the mud runs off from the mountain.  And you just see this patio and some guy's big statue collapsing.  I've seen that 800 times.  It's just weird because our old pal Jay now lives out here.  And I was hanging out with Jay a little bit last night.  Jay from Framingham, not Jay Moore.  No, not Jay Moore.  Jay from Framingham. 
[00:11:00]  And a bunch of us went out.  And he's like, look, man, when you're from the East Coast, this is just regular weather.  It's no big deal.  But he's saying that the locals out here are just losing their minds with the rain and the mudslides.  It's rain.  It's not a hurricane.  It's not a tornado.  It's not some weird weather event that never happens.  These people are freaking out over rain.  I understand mudslides and stuff like that.  But it's rain.  This is the third rainiest season on record for out here.  And the rainy season goes all the way to June. 
[00:11:30]  They're up to, I think, something like 33 to 34 inches for the season.  The record, the all-time record is 38.  That's ever, ever all-time record.  And they've got, what, like four months left in the season.  And then there's this huge rock that's just, you know.  I saw that clip, yeah.  Oh, you saw that?  It's just, it's ready to go.  It's right over the PCH, right outside Malibu.  Pacific Coast Highway for those people that don't live here, Opie.  Well, I consider this, like, almost my second home.  I love it out here.  And it's just kind of teetering and ready to go. 
[00:12:00]  And the locals are losing their minds because that's the only way to get to their homes.  Yeah, pretty much close the road.  Yeah, they're not allowing the locals to drive on PCH in that area.  And then did you see the tiger?  The news was just full of crazy stuff this morning.  This is California.  It's the oddest place to ever live.  There's stuff going on here between, you know, earthquakes, fires, mudslides.  And then you've got to worry about tigers.  It was a tiger roaming around.  But they killed it, right?  Yeah.  They shot it this morning.  Whose tiger was it?  They don't know where it came from. 
[00:12:30]  It was just wandering around in the hills.  It had been out there.  They've had reports of it since, I guess, mid-February.  Yeah.  And it's a full-grown, huge tiger.  Wait, they've had reports for almost a month?  Yeah, that they've been seeing this thing around.  Okay, and they finally found it, and they decided, well, we've got to kill it.  Well, they said, why didn't they tranquilize it and stuff?  And one of the spokesmen said, well, it was heading toward a populated area,  and we were afraid if we shot it with a tranquilizer that it might run off and injure some people. 
[00:13:00]  But you know damn well these good old boys are just like, when am I going to get an opportunity to shoot a tiger?  Right, right, right.  How many guys get an opportunity to shoot a full-sized, like, Bengal tiger?  Well, because they have the mountain lions out here.  Yeah, plenty of those.  You read about people bicycling in the hills, and they wind up getting ripped to shreds.  Did I ever tell you my mountain lion story?  It's really no big deal, but when I come out here, I do a lot of hiking.  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of old fire roads.  Sure.  You know, they're roads where the fire could get up into the hills to put out the brush fires and all. 
[00:13:30]  So they have these special fire roads where they go up, and you go up into the mountains and stuff,  and there's a lot of hikers, day hikers, will hike these fire roads.  And I didn't notice on the way in, but I noticed on the way out after doing like a two, three-hour day hike last time I was out here,  huge sign, beware of mountain lions, do not walk alone in this area.  Mountain lions.  But that's what I see on the way out.  I'm like, oh, my God, are you kidding me?  And you're just trotting around up there, dopey New Yorker. 
[00:14:00]  You go around these weird, you know, these kind of corners and stuff, and, you know,  a mountain lion could perfectly be, you know, perched up above you and just jump down and pounce.  Come out of the brush and kill you.  It's amazing, California.  It's the weirdest goddamn place to live or to visit because there's just so many bizarre things going on.  You know, what do you got in New York?  The occasional homeless guy that whacks you over the head with a cobblestone.  You got maybe a homeboy.  He'll try to rob you and shoot you.  Right.  Stuff like that.  You know, normal news.  Out here, it's just bizarre. 
[00:14:30]  A huge Bengal tiger was shot today as half a house rolls down a hillside.  Yeah, they're just talking about these houses.  Well, lucky enough, he only lost half his house this time around.  Yeah, the mudslides are everywhere, but it's sunny today, and I guess that's it for the rain.  We brought the sunshine out with us, Opie, didn't we?  Even though our forecasters that are part of the ONA crew are like,  no, dude, it's going to rain the whole time we're here.  It's going to suck, blah, blah, blah.  It's beautiful out today.  It's like 60 degrees and sunny.  Well, did Steve give you the forecast?  Because perhaps it was the same forecast he gave for Newark Airport with the massive delays, as he put it. 
[00:15:00]  Before we left, Steve said, I'm hearing massive delays at Newark Airport because we had the snow the day before,  and I guess they had canceled some flights.  We walked into Newark, and it was a ghost town airport.  There was nobody there but us.  It was one of the easiest flights to ever take.  Yeah, so we were laughing at Steve at his massive delay report at the airport. 
[00:15:30]  Man.  And the weather, the same thing, yeah.  Oh, it's going to rain the whole time we're there.  Nice and sunny this morning.  Yeah.  Finally done with it.  Beautiful.  They're still trying to get a microphone for Jim Norton.  Are you kidding?  We've been going this long.  We can't get one more microphone?  Norton's livid.  Norton is livid.  He's cursing his ass off.  I saw they had asked Norton to check a mic, and we were in the middle of a conversation a couple of minutes ago,  and Norton looks like, they're talking.  Like, I can't, but it would be funny if you just started going, check one, two, check, check, as we're doing our show. 
[00:16:00]  And we can't share microphones because we've got these stupid headsets on.  The wacky headset mics.  What, like we're at the, you know, a PGA event or something?  Yeah.  And, you know, I don't want Norton that close to me.  I think they give us these when it's going to be a little noisy because I take it, with this room filling up with 50 or so tables full of poker players,  it's not going to be quiet out there.  We're not exactly in the room.  We're not close to the tables.  How far away would you say we are? 
[00:16:30]  30 feet.  30 feet.  30 feet from your table, and then there's like, you know, two more tables beyond that.  It's like a whole ballroom.  It's like three or four rows, I guess.  Although we're not in the middle of it, you're definitely going to hear some noise.  So I guess that's why they gave us these.  I didn't expect this.  I mean, this is really, really cool.  Are we getting video and pictures of this?  You never watched it on TV?  I take a peek here and there.  Like, you mentioned this Doyle character.  I don't know who Doyle is.  Doyle Brunson.  I have no idea.  No clue.  He's one of the old-timers, pro, you know, been in it for years and years.  But what's odd about this whole thing, like the World Poker Tour, 
[00:17:00]  up until just a couple of years ago, this stuff was going on,  but it didn't have this hoopla to it.  I mean, they had maybe 30 players would register for these things up until just a few years ago,  before they started putting it on TV.  You get 30 players come in for maybe a $5,000 buy-in, stuff like that.  Now, you know, you're getting hundreds of players at $25,000 a pop to come in here and play poker in these tournaments. 
[00:17:30]  And it just really started taking off when they started doing these shows and televising it  and getting it on television like this.  And now, you know, you walk in and you see this hoopla,  and you wonder how somebody like Doyle Brunson, who, you know, was playing in the friggin' 40s, you know,  feels about stuff like this.  You know, I'd love to ask him that, if we get him at the table, you know,  how it's changed over the years and how he feels about all this pomp and circumstance.  Now, look at the lights and the set that they have and the cameras and everything.  Yeah, they're getting the TV lights on again, so it's going to be great. 
[00:18:00]  So what's going to be your strategy, Anthony?  I've said it before, my strategy, I don't know if it's going to work or not, is to hang.  Well, I'm doing what I do.  When we first sat down, you were like, oh, my God.  I'm doing what I do.  It's starting to become a little overwhelming.  Radio.  Radio.  Is that your phone going, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  I turned off my radio.  Or the trio.  Someone's phone is making noise every so often.  Yeah, whatever.  And, yeah, when I sat down, you know, I get a little nervous just thinking of this.  I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to have to play poker with these people.  But, yeah, I've relaxed a little bit. 
[00:18:30]  You're going to be in the same boat as most of these people, though.  I don't know.  Because how many professionals could there possibly be in here?  Not really.  No, not the professionals.  But a lot of these celebrities spend a lot of time playing poker, man.  They have nothing better to do, right?  Nothing better to do.  So, yeah, they're going to be out there.  I don't know.  I'm not so much nervous.  It's not like it's my money, you know?  I'm not gambling away my money.  I just would like to be able to hang out in there for a little while longer than just,  you know, five minutes and then I'm gone.  My strategy, I've said it before, is to kind of lay back a little bit. 
[00:19:00]  I'll play the good hands.  But for the most part, at the beginning, when the blinds are still pretty low, I'm not going  to take too many chances.  I'm going to see if the table I'm at, if some of the hard, heavy hitters at the table can  thin out the crowd a little bit, take out a few people.  I'll sit back.  You know, like I said, play the good hands, but watch a little bit.  And then, you know, as I get the good cards, play into those.  Are we going to have, like, some kind of hand signals or something?  Well, you're going to be able to see me.  I'm going to be able to see you.  And hopefully, you'll be able to face me. 
[00:19:30]  That'll be kind of cool.  If I point to myself and put up my middle finger, that's universal sign for I'm fucked.  Which should pretty much, it's a clear signal.  It's concise.  It's not confusing.  Like, it's not, don't confuse it with I'm number one, Opie.  You know, it's going to be, you've got a pretty clear view of me.  At this point, you and I know each other's mannerisms.  So, if you're facing me, I'll be able to tell everyone exactly what's going on in your head.  Exactly.  Yes, just by my expressions. 
[00:20:00]  You will know if I'm winning or losing.  Yeah, you'll be rolling your eyes.  Horribly.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to try.  Because you're not going to be giving me subtle, obvious signals, obviously.  I'm going to actually be reading your face from 30 feet away, and I guarantee I'll nail it.  Well, I'm going to try to keep a real poker face on.  And for the people that watch, you've seen people like Phil Ivey is one of those that's just a pro at not showing anything.  This guy can sit there with the best hand or the biggest bluff, and he will have the same face. 
[00:20:30]  Even after the hand's over and he won, he won't let on that he was bluffing or he had the good hand and give the other guy the satisfaction.  It is just stone face.  And I'm hoping fear will give that talent to me.  See, that's why I can't play poker.  We were discussing this last night at dinner.  I'm the guy, like, first of all, my pride would get in the way.  If someone keeps raising me, I'm like, screw that, man.  I'm in.  I'm in.  I'm in.  And then I would also, this is why I would not be able to play poker in the end when the bed is over and that hand is over or whatever. 
[00:21:00]  I would have to see what the guy had.  It would drive me absolutely nuts, not knowing if he was bluffing or if he had whatever, you know, the straight or the, you know.  It will drive you crazy.  But with these television shows, up until a few years ago, you never knew what was going on.  But now with the cameras that they have on the table, they show what everybody's hold cards are.  So a lot of these guys, they don't know immediately what they had.  But, you know, a month later when these shows air, they get to watch. 
[00:21:30]  And I would love to see what these guys' reactions are when they're sitting there and realize, you know,  the guy was sitting there with a great hand and he folded because this guy was just screwing with him.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's got to be fun to watch these people at home watching these tapes.  There's the spotlight.  They're now testing the spotlight, Anthony.  Ooh.  Are we ever going to get Jim Norton on and Ben and Steve?  We have a lot to talk about.  Actually, anybody else but just Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I mean, Anthony and I.  It's like the old days, though.  I know.  We're sick of looking at each other.  So it's always good to have a third person in the mix. 
[00:22:00]  Somebody we can just turn to and maybe address.  Yeah.  Hello, stupid.  Yeah, Ben, on the way over here, there's a local morning show.  They've done quite well for themselves over the years, Kevin and Bean in Los Angeles.  And Ben's, like, telling the story how these guys don't even broadcast from the same studio anymore.  Really?  Yeah, because one of the guys has, you know, personal problems with whatever.  And so I think he's in Seattle.  Do they not like each other?  No.  I mean, there was rumors for a while that they didn't like each other.  But, no, I think it's actually a legitimate thing. 
[00:22:30]  So the one guy does the show from his home in Seattle, and the other guy does it from Los Angeles.  And they just have TV screens to look at each other.  And Ben's telling us, like, can you imagine doing a radio show like that?  I'm like, Ben, Aunt and I are about two years away from doing it exactly like that.  How you doing, oh, man?  Hey, man.  Scratching yourself.  You get to just walk around.  What is it, at their house or something?  Yeah, that's the cool part.  The guy, I guess, has breakfast and coffee, goes downstairs to some kind of studio they built for him, and he's ready to go. 
[00:23:00]  I know the reason, Ben.  I just didn't want to say it.  So you can, like, walk around with a wireless headset, Mike, and pretty much just go about your day and do the radio show.  That's amazing.  They do it every day, and they pull it off.  They're still pretty popular out here.  That is amazing.  In Los Angeles.  How the hell does that work?  So what's going on with the mics?  Nothing?  Yeah.  Any ETA on when we'll have or what it is?  We're going to have to take a break, and then we're going to be able to.  It should be fixed by the time we get back from a break.  Should we take a long break?  How many guest mics will we have once Jimmy has a mic? 
[00:23:30]  Jimmy is living.  Two guest mics?  Jimmy's living.  I love this because I used to be the guy.  I just don't care anymore.  Yeah.  And I really mean I don't care anymore.  I don't care.  Because you throw a lot of energy out there, and you show passion, and you don't have any  of that passion being shown back to you.  So you're like, all right, well, why should I care then?  But Jim has taken it up, taken up the cause.  I'd say he's steamed.  He's a little steamed.  Jim has taken up the cause.  He's like how I used to be. 
[00:24:00]  I just can't be bothered anymore.  If no one else is going to care and show the passion back, then all right, I'll just call  it in every day.  He's hot under the collar.  Jimmy wants to freaking strangle someone at this point.  We have no other mic that works, right?  It's just our two mics?  All right.  All right.  So does Eric have a nice long sweeper or something that we can play?  A sweeper.  A long sweeper.  Boy, that'll give us an extra eight seconds.  I know.  I know.  So this is what's going to happen.  Anthony's doing the show until about, what time zone are we in?  I guess, what? 
[00:24:30]  Two o'clock Pacific.  Two o'clock Pacific?  So that'll be five o'clock Eastern.  Okay, five o'clock Eastern and two o'clock, okay, I got it, two o'clock Pacific.  Anthony will be doing the show, and then he's got to get to his table and play some poker.  Right.  We'll be getting some kind of updates through Ben or somebody who's going to be a runner,  because I hear that we could go over there, kind of?  Yeah, one guy is going to be able to go over there, probably Ben, and get updates, constant  updates.  All right.  And through hand signals or facial expressions, you'll be able to look at me.  I might be able to turn around if I'm not facing you. 
[00:25:00]  Hopefully, I'll be facing you.  So, Kenny, maybe you can find out where seat number one is at table 14 and see if it's  facing us or away from us.  Yeah, Kenny's running over there right now.  That's good.  Kenny's going to check that out.  All right.  And then we've got some celebrities that hopefully will be stopping by the show to help us out.  I hear Joe Rogan's doing the show with us today.  Yeah, Rogan's going to show up.  You know what?  We've got to get the end of the Rogan story.  We talk about how this show is a bunch of little, like, storylines.  And some we complete in one day, and others they go on for a month, and then you finally  get the end of the story. 
[00:25:30]  You get the money shot.  That pay off.  He's got to tell a story of, what's his name, Doug Stanhope and that whacked-out drug they  were trying.  Remember?  The story was getting really good, and then we ran out of show.  So, Rogan's stopping by.  He'll finally tell us what happened with that.  Rich Voss is here with his lovely fiancée.  Bonnie.  And who else is stopping by, definitely.  There was one more person who told me.  Whatever.  And then we've got a whole list of people that...  A list of celebrities.  Some of them pretty heavy hitters in the poker world, and you wouldn't really know it.  You know that goddamn, what's her name, Mina Suvari? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  That alien-headed-looking girl from what movie?  American Beauty, American Pie.  She's a pretty good poker player.  Really?  Yeah.  And who would figure that?  You know, you sit at a table with her, and you figure...  Rob Schneider.  Rob Schneider's here.  Sarah Gilbert.  Sean Fanning from Napster, the Napster founder.  Screech is here, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus.  And then you get, like, James Woods, you know?  Is he here?  I saw...  I didn't see it on the list, but I heard who's Diamond Phillips.  We saw him walking around.  I'm sorry. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, James Woods, there he is.  I saw...  I thought this said Screech.  It's actually Skeet Ulrich.  Oh.  Scream.  That's a little...  Oh, Kenny, will I be facing?  Yes, you are sitting right next to the dealer facing our broadcast table.  Oh, perfect.  Okay, so I am facing the table.  Very good.  Ray Romano's going to be in the room.  Gabe Kaplan, who's a great poker player, Anthony.  Gabe Kaplan?  Mr. Cotter?  I know, he's a great poker player.  Yeah, he plays a lot.  Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond.  He's going to be in the house.  Who else?  Just looking real fast.  Dean Cain.  Ed Asner.  The hairy beast will be here. 
[00:27:00]  Jennifer Tilly.  James Woods.  Jon Favreau.  He plays a lot of poker, too.  Mac Culkin.  Better known as Macaulay.  Macaulay Culkin.  Culkin, but they call him now Mac.  I guess that's his poker name.  Lou Diamond Phillips.  We already saw him walking around and wandering around.  He's got something to do with this.  Does he?  I'm not sure, but he was...  We saw him walking around, and he was barking out orders like some kind of director.  Okay.  So I think either that or he's really a prima donna.  Rodney Peet, former NFL player, of course.  And now the list goes on and on. 
[00:27:30]  Paulie Adams from No Doubt.  Yeah, right on.  Adrian Young from No Doubt.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll try to get Jim Norton on the program.  It would be nice to get Norton involved with the program today.  Jim Norton did something very nice for Martini Steve.  We'll talk about that.  Oh, that's right.  His little birthday present.  After the break, and I guess...  No, it's not what you think, you perverts.  As we go to break, it's Stephen Lynch singing a little bit special on the Opie and Anthony program.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend. 
[00:28:00]  Ed was kind, with good intent, but just a little different.  Oh, special Ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special. 
[00:28:30]  We'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier heat, heat, heat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a tree.  Oh, special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed. 
[00:29:00]  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran headfirst in two walls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike. 
[00:29:30]  And if I love a girl, who cares who you like?  It's special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit.  I thought college life was great. 
[00:30:00]  Ed could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner special.  Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit.  Just a little bit. 
[00:30:30]  One day talking to special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew  that special Ed just made me special too.  My shoes hurt.  Now I laugh as I count bugs.  I give strangers great big hugs. 
[00:31:00]  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Just a little bit special. 
[00:31:30]  That fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special.  Don't laugh at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Don't laugh at me. 
[00:32:00]  Don't laugh at me.  Don't laugh at me.  Holy ass.  That's a clip I've never heard before.  Was that Julia Louis?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Don't laugh at me.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on W...  Oh, no.  On XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:32:30]  Hello.  My name is Elaine, and I'll be your tour guide to South Central Los Angeles.  Do you have any difference between hookers and actresses?  Okay.  You want to fill me in?  Hookers get paid more.  That's what the bottom line is.  It's a bunch of geeks and a bunch of porn stars in the same place at the same time.  Hot young men pointing at each other.  Getting educated every minute.  Like someone making grilled cheese with an iron.  Stupid criminal.  Holy crap.  Say goodbye to your T-shows, everyone.  Live from Los Angeles. 
[00:33:00]  Just pummel them with nightsticks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all the voices.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I mean, I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin. 
[00:33:30]  Fix it, fix it.  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back hook it.  Nice head, dick.  Back.  Bagot.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back hook it.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Yes, who's back?  Yes, who's back?  Back, back, back, back again.  Yes, who's back?  I'm afraid.  Oh, gosh.  Yes, who's back? 
[00:34:00]  Yes, who's back?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Burn it all up.  Burn it all up.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's that all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  Now, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little hope.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little hope.  Because it feels so empty without me. 
[00:34:30]  In and out.  Okay, carton.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, wow.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  Still more talking.  I have never seen Jim look more disgusted than my wife.  And I've seen him look disgusted before. 
[00:35:00]  I hope our microphones are on.  They are?  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  We're in Los Angeles at the Commerce Casino in, yeah, Los Angeles.  Kind of in the ghetto.  It's off the interstate.  It's off the beaten path.  It's on the other side of the tracks.  We're at the World Poker Tour, and Anthony's going to be playing in about an hour and a half, it looks like.  Oh, yeah.  And then Jimmy and I will do the rest of the program, and we'll be watching Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  He's right over there, table 14.  It's only about 25, 30 feet right in front of us.  He's going to be facing our broadcast center, so it should be very exciting to see how he's doing by just reading his facial expressions.  One of fear.  That's pretty much the only facial expression you're going to see out of me.  And they're setting up the other tables.  Look at those guys.  They're getting all the other tables ready.  A lot of work going on here.  And I think at this point we have Jim Norton joining the program.  Yeah.  Is that good?  Is it fixed?  Oh, there's Jimmy. 
[00:36:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  All right.  38 minutes.  All right.  Cool.  I had a nice little break there.  There we go.  That's perfect.  Oh, boy.  Don't mess with my headphone.  No, no, no.  I'm just trying to fix mine.  I'm sure I'll cut something out by doing that.  You were a little angry.  You ever see how De Niro treated his date in Cape Fear?  That's what I want to start doing to people.  Just punching them in my bed and biting pieces of their face and spitting it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a little long.  Cranky.  Yeah.  That was a little long.  This is the last road trip I'm doing. 
[00:36:30]  I don't want to do this anymore.  For what?  Remember when we used to be like this, Opie?  Yeah.  Now I just go with the flow now.  And we're like, eh, screw it.  We're beaten dogs.  I was going to say we're like the beaten horses.  You know, you see those wild horses.  Oh, that's Jimmy.  Yeah.  No one could calm them.  You know, they ride them and the horses just buck them off.  Yep.  They don't want to listen to authority and be hooked in.  And snorting all the time out of the nose.  Right.  And beaten.  And then finally have a saddle thrown over the back of them.  They don't want that. 
[00:37:00]  Guess what?  You're looking at it and I.  We're two old horses now.  We're just big ass saddles on our back.  And we're like, eh.  They feed us every day.  We get food.  We get water.  It would be cool to run wild and fuck other horses.  I remember the old days running wild.  Right.  Now it's like, ah.  They bring us inside when it's raining.  And there's Jimmy trying to knock the stall down so he can get out.  He doesn't realize how futile it is. 
[00:37:30]  So what's up, Jimmy?  Oh, I'm good, man.  Yeah.  It's good to be here.  Just kind of standing around like an idiot.  I'm just so cranky.  Yeah, well, and we wanted you in on the first break, but.  Ah, that didn't happen.  Well, we can't share microphones because we have these headsets on and it would just be  very creepy and weird if we were, you know, wearing the same headset as we try to do a  radio show.  You know, Jimmy, what you could have done to broadcast during that first break was to  just ask Opie if you could smell his breath.  And then while he was doing it, talk. 
[00:38:00]  And what you'd be doing is broadcasting through his mic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we got the extra mic working?  Well, Ben, why don't you pick that up, man?  Good.  I want to wish you.  When it rains, it pours, right?  We got one mic.  We got them all.  I can't hear you.  No, I can't hear you, Ben.  That's good.  There you are.  What?  Yeah, cool.  Steve can hear you, so you can broadcast to Steve.  Yeah.  Good.  Wait.  Hey, Ben, it's this mic.  This mic's live.  Here you go.  That one is over-modulating like crazy, so keep it away a little bit.  Yeah, don't kiss that mic.  Keep it about, I'd call it about six inches away. 
[00:38:30]  Who's this?  Oh, my God.  Deacon Jones, my friend.  Deacon Jones, man.  Deacon Jones.  What's up, Deacon Jones?  What's what I'm doing, Deacon?  Look at your bling-bling, bro.  Hold this.  Hold this.  That's probably why you didn't know it.  Of course I'm going to get it.  Deacon, you have to talk to this.  Yeah, give Deacon Jones this mic.  Deacon Jones.  How long, Mr. Jones?  How are you?  I'm glad to be here.  You guys are interested in getting your ratings up, huh?  Yeah, can I have a picture with you?  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's not even waiting any longer to take pictures.  Jimmy's not even.  You think I want to be talking about with you? 
[00:39:00]  Stand up.  Oh, I am really.  Stand up, Edel.  He's all just noticed.  Hurry up, Ben, before he hurts me.  Maybe it's better that Jimmy doesn't have a microphone.  He's already.  Thanks.  That guy, TJ, is the one.  Deacon Jones.  Deacon Jones.  Sit on down, man.  Thank you very much, guys.  I got to say one of my favorites.  Hey, is that a Super Bowl ring?  No, that's a Hall of Fame ring.  Can I see it?  Come on, that's even better.  Thank you.  This is number 113.  Look at the size of that.  OB, get back here.  Where are you going?  He's running off with his ring. 
[00:39:30]  There you go.  You're going to need a better head start than that.  I try to take off with Deacon Jones' Hall of Fame ring.  Look at the size of that thing.  Put it on.  I can put this around my penis, I think.  Jesus.  If you were that lucky.  And I'm not that small, but this will put it around my damn dick.  Wow.  I lost weight.  I had to put a filter in it, you know, to compensate for it.  How much weight did you lose, Deacon?  105 pounds.  That's awesome.  105?  Yeah.  Wow.  I had to. 
[00:40:00]  I did it over a five-year period.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had to.  I was having some problems physically.  Oh, there you go.  Here's your beer.  The lower back.  The blonde.  The lower back.  Nice.  What do you think of that, Deacon?  Thank you, Jesus.  Wow.  Thank you, Jesus.  Look at the girl that just brought Deacon over here.  All I can do now is look.  You know, I can't do nothing by my eyes.  I can always look.  You can always look.  That's right.  Absolutely.  Yeah, but, you know, back to the weight thing, you know.  Who was asking about your weight?  I'm 66 years old. 
[00:40:30]  And, you know, when you're 66 and you survive 14 years in the NFL.  Yeah.  You know, although I didn't get no operations or anything, you know, you still.  You know, I was zoomed up to about 320 pounds when I left the game.  Wow.  Because I didn't do anything.  And then, you know, the old blood pressure ran up.  And then, you know, the old physical problems started to come in.  And I was very lucky.  I didn't have no injury.  So, I didn't have no problem there.  But the lower back is a standard injury for linemen.  And, boy, I had a 54-inch waistline.  And I just could not even walk up a flight of stairs. 
[00:41:00]  So, I had to do something about it.  Now, I got a 35-inch waistline and my phone keeps ringing.  Yeah, it keeps on happening.  It's great.  One more now.  Well, how tall are you?  6'5".  6'5".  How much do you weigh?  I weigh about 225.  But you used to weigh like 350?  Well, no, no.  No, no, no.  I said when I retired from the game, I played at 275.  Oh, okay, okay.  When I retired, I went up.  Then you ballooned up after that.  Right, right.  Right on.  Because I quit exercising.  Uh-huh.  My check stopped.  I stopped all football activity.  Yeah.  Were the guys doing the steroids back in your day?  Oh, what is a steroid? 
[00:41:30]  I still can't identify.  He doesn't know.  What's a steroid?  Oh, that ain't nothing but garbage, man.  I mean, you know what?  I'll give you all the steroids you want.  You give me my 1967 legs back, and I'll give you a bottle of that stuff.  Let's see if it works.  You know what I'm saying?  Because there ain't nothing work I've ever seen but hard work and dedication.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You understand?  All the steroid users probably ended up working harder.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's it, huh?  But I mean, if you can make men and make bad averages like they say they can, then there  would be a hell of a lot more guys outside the bar playing instead of sitting in the 
[00:42:00]  bar bullshitting.  So you don't believe in that steroid thing at all?  You don't believe in none of that garbage.  I think a man has to be a man.  All right.  I mean, you know, the press has built up a lot of things about that.  Well, you got to.  But, I mean, the baseball players, they've been doing the steroids.  They might make your body look a different way.  Right.  But if you ain't got eye-hand coordination, you ain't going to hit that curveball and you  ain't going to hit that fastball.  That's what Barry Bonds was saying last night.  It's a fact.  It is a fact.  And he was saying on one of these shows last night.  But the fact is, yeah, you need the eye-hand coordination to hit the baseball, but because 
[00:42:30]  of the steroids, you're hitting it another 20, 30 feet probably, right?  Well, I mean, you know, that's just like saying if you gave a football player steroids, you  know, and, you know, I'm sure that some of those guys have been taking them too.  I mean, I don't know.  Don't quote me on that.  No.  I don't know.  But I'd be sure in all sports there's some problem with some kind of a drug, okay?  And they call them enhancement.  What is it?  Human growth hormones, all that stuff.  All that garbage.  You know, it might make your body develop or overdevelop. 
[00:43:00]  But what does it do for your football game or your baseball game?  That's what the question is.  You still need the talent, right?  You still need the talent and you still need eye-hand coordination.  And it's like if you've got a lineman, you can give him all the steroids you want.  If he's got slow feet, he ain't going to be no lineman.  Right.  Sure.  Okay.  As simple as that.  And I want to know where the cutoff is.  I want to know where it makes you hit 75 home runs at and where it doesn't.  Why can't you pick up the bat then and take steroids and hit 77 home runs?  Yeah, right.  I don't understand that.  That's what I always try to tell him. 
[00:43:30]  And he's always saying that the steroids make them better players.  And I'm like, no, because it doesn't help with your actual skill.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't do anything for your actual skill.  I told you that.  Look at my muscles.  I'm on the steroids.  Put your arm down, man.  Put your arm down.  Somebody see you.  Somebody see you.  You got his arms up.  Hey, my breakfast was bigger than that.  And I'm going to die.  God damn.  I just got to sit here and take it because he's a monster.  He's nailing you.  He's nailing you. 
[00:44:00]  So are you playing today?  Am I playing today?  I don't know.  I'm going to win today.  You're going to win.  I didn't come here to play.  I could have gave me a last night and played.  You play a lot of poker?  All my life.  Really?  I play some form of poker.  You play hold of Malatham?  I made a living on certain guys.  Really?  I didn't get the big money, but I got it from certain quarterbacks playing.  See, he's one of the dangerous guys out there.  He's going to be dangerous out there.  I hope they don't let me deal.  No.  Because if I deal, I will never lose.  Oh, bottom of the deck, stuff like that? 
[00:44:30]  No, I didn't say that.  Of course you didn't say that.  Anthony said it.  He said it, not me.  You know, the hair slap might be illegal in pro football, but it ain't illegal in this casino.  Have you been in any tournaments before?  Any poker tournaments?  No, this is my first time.  I'm kind of retired.  I don't make too many appearances.  I like poker because, you know, I got some friends of mine who, a couple years ago, we started playing Texas Hold'em. 
[00:45:00]  It's a fun game, and I played a couple golf to them, and Marcus Allen has a game, you know, at his tournament.  Are you a golfer?  Oh, yeah.  I'm an athlete.  Oh.  That might be a little bit strange to you.  Okay, but I'm an athlete.  I'm actually very athletic myself.  I drink, I smoke, and I go out with girls.  Is this guy on the show?  Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.  Why y'all got him standing all the way over there from you?  Has he got some kind of disease? 
[00:45:30]  No, you do know him.  Well, look at him.  I mean, can't you figure it out?  He say, I stink.  His shirt say, I stink.  If anybody put that on their shirt, I kind of question that.  The guy say, I stink.  No wonder y'all got him over there.  I was actually standing there, but you moved me over, and I was going to move.  But look at what they got you here.  They got you away from the group.  Well, no, I was standing right there, and you just stepped in, and I moved.  Oh, I pulled you over here.  You kind of threatened me just by looking at me, and I left.  I threatened everybody.  What was I going to do?  I threatened everybody.  That's my job.  You're a big man.  I know it.  It ain't the size of the sea that make the ship sink. 
[00:46:00]  It's the rock and motion of the ocean.  That means you have a small penis.  No.  What the hell?  How did you get that out of that, Opie?  How did you get that out of that?  Why would you think of being a little bit?  Evidently, you ain't heard about the myth.  Wait, what happened?  No, I've heard about the myth.  Well, trust me, I started it.  Wait, what did he say then?  I thought he was saying that that's the...  No, man.  How did you say that again so I could try to figure out what he was saying?  Is this show authorized?  Is it actually on the air?  Are we actually on the air?  Are we just talking locally here? 
[00:46:30]  This is actually being fed into a tape recorder.  We're just going to play for our friends later.  Oh, good.  Then we cut him out.  Then we cut him out.  Yeah, you got tricked, man.  This isn't being broadcast anywhere.  And you watch it.  You see now how good I am.  Yeah.  Watch your ratings change anyway.  Deacon's all right, bro.  He's all right.  I like Deacon.  One of my favorite Odd Couple episodes with Deacon Jones in it.  Oh, thank you.  Remember that one?  He was doing a film in the commercial, right?  We did that in 1969.  69.  69, and they still play it.  That residuals is that residuals. 
[00:47:00]  You get a check from that?  To this day.  Isn't that something?  Checks for 10 cents?  No.  The residuals weren't that great back then.  I started not much hiding that.  What was the shaving cream?  What was it?  Back then?  Back then in 1969.  Where were you born?  I was born in the 60s.  What year in the 60s?  Right around there.  It would take a couple years.  No, no.  Give me your actual date.  Give Mr. Jones your age.  How old do you think I am?  Don't ask me that question.  I mean, we on the air.  Can't you give it up?  Are you embarrassed about it?  No, I was born in 65. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, I got jockstraps older than you.  I still got jockstraps.  It's unwashed, man.  Right off the field, right in my trophy case.  All I'm trying to say is when you were in a sitcom back in the...  But you've been in 65.  You can't say nothing to my presence.  No.  You're supposed to raise your hand and ask permission.  We have studied TV shows.  No, you haven't.  And we have friends that were on old sitcoms.  This is the only point I'm trying to make.  They didn't have the residual thing happen like they do today.  The guys from Seinfeld are going to be making just boatloads of money for the rest of their lives 
[00:48:00]  because they had a much better deal as far as the residuals go.  The football players.  No, I know.  You know what my first contract was?  How much?  $7,500.  So what?  $7,500 in 1961.  Five years before you were born.  Righteous bucks.  That's a mere bag of show.  Yeah, but gas was 25 cents a gallon.  Right.  Okay.  You know what?  I could go out in the Hollywood highest-priced restaurant and wouldn't spend $75. 
[00:48:30]  Can you do that now?  Yeah, he does.  So you need more money than I did.  Yeah, he's stupid.  And plus, I'm not bothering Deacon.  And furthermore, I'm retired, I said, so I got most of mine.  He has a pension coming in.  He saved it.  Stop fucking with the residual money.  I'm sorry about that, Mr. Deacon.  That's all right.  He's going to call me on my 69 residual money.  I don't like it.  He's calling you old and saying you're broke.  I don't like it.  Oh, my God.  Look at him selling you down the river.  Yeah, you own your case, man.  Deacon, he's throwing you under a bus, Opie.  You can knock him down any time you want.  No, he's working for me. 
[00:49:00]  I see that.  I don't like that.  I'll get him back, though.  No problem.  Well, I hope I'm not at Deacon's table.  What table are you starting at?  Number seven.  Number seven?  I'm at 14, so I'm playing, too.  Anthony's playing.  I'm leaving the program.  You ain't going to be here very long, so don't leave your seat.  I'm not.  You'll be back over here in a few minutes.  I'm going to phone it in.  I'm at table 14.  Right across the way.  So at least I don't have to play against Deacon, who I know is a good poker player.  Oh, you planning on getting out in the first round?  Do you want to play against me?  I don't know. 
[00:49:30]  You're not sure about yourself?  This is my first tournament also, so, you know.  First tournament?  It's one of these things that...  You've got to have some guts, man.  Some intestinal fortitude.  I've got some intestinal something.  I think I caught it from Wolfe.  I can't see what's going to upset me.  All these people, nothing but people.  I'm a master of people.  All right.  You know.  But what about...  You give me some cards, you've got a problem.  You've got a good poker face?  Oh, poker face.  Yeah.  Remember who I used to stare at?  Well, okay.  You don't want to look into my eyes. 
[00:50:00]  That's true.  No one ever did want to look into Deacon's eyes.  I asked for my offensive lineman about looking in my eyes.  Okay.  You'll look away, son.  Intimidating.  You'll keep the sunglasses on?  Oh, wait till I get through with that writer who wrote that bad article about me this morning.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What was this about?  What paper is he writes for the second?  He writes on the second page of the Times.  What did he say?  Los Angeles Times?  All right.  It's on the second page.  You know, I don't give him...  Who could possibly say something bad about Deacon Jones?  Let's see what they said about Deacon Jones in the paper.  Where are we going?  Turn to the sports section.  Sports section. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, you're a sports guy?  What, do you think he's going to be in politics section?  I thought...  What do you think he's going to be in politics section?  I hope he's looking at world events like they're sending Deacon over to Iraq.  Wait, you were over in Fallujah?  What happened?  I was in Iraq in March.  You were over there.  All right.  Let's see.  I was over there for a week.  I'll have no problem reading this.  Oh, there's a whole thing on...  You're going to put their guns down when I woke up.  There's a whole thing on...  Are you Rosie Greer?  No, you're not Rosie.  Where are you?  What do you want to smack?  He's going to smack you when they head.  That's why I'm not looking up as I bravely say that.  Somebody come and read this for him. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  What do you want me to say?  I don't want you to say nothing.  Well, where's the bad part?  Read the article.  I don't know where the bad part is.  Read the article.  You want me to read the whole article?  Look for his name.  It's got to be highlighted somewhere, right?  The whole article is on me.  I don't know what the hell you're looking for.  It seems that David Jones fancies himself a car shark playing host to a game of poker.  Did you say David Jones?  Yeah.  That's my real name.  That's his real name.  Oh, I didn't know that.  David Deacon Jones.  No, no.  I thought it was Deacon.  You've been living on the rock.  No, I don't know.  He just knows you as Deacon.  I call you Mr. Jones.  He knows you as Deacon.  We know you as David. 
[00:51:30]  Respect.  I know him as David.  We go way back.  It seems that David Jones fancies himself a car shark playing host to a game of poker at  his home every Saturday night.  And while it's my civic duty to pass that address on to the local vice squad, I find it amusing  that David, who prefers to be called Deacon, is about to feel what it's like to be sacked.  Uh-oh.  That's all he said about you.  Anybody who had any experiment with me would never write that in a paper, would they?  Has he ever played cards with you?  No.  This guy, he is a young.  He covered the Dodgers.  Yeah.  This guy, he writes on the second page. 
[00:52:00]  You know, first of all, if I had known he was a second page writer, he wouldn't have  the article.  Because I don't deal with nothing but front page stuff, okay?  I hear you.  This guy's on the second page, and he's proud of it.  Well, he didn't really say anything that bad.  He's saying that he's going to, uh...  But he didn't say anything good enough.  Do you see Mr. Jones on that one time?  Exactly.  That's true.  Mr. Jones.  Mr. Jones.  Mr. Deacon Jones.  Did he turn me in to the police and say I won a poker game every Saturday night?  He did.  He certainly did.  Well, what's your address?  You couldn't get to me, man.  I live behind gates. 
[00:52:30]  You can't get to me.  You can't get to me.  Cops can't get to me, unless I live in.  Oh, damn.  Well, that's not that bad.  That's great.  See, that's how you think.  It's really not that bad.  Actually, I use a baseball writer writing about me.  I question that.  Well, you know about poker anyway, right?  Baseball writer.  Get out of here, man.  You know, we take more money from the Times guy.  We don't want to be responsible for them getting the expense account.  Right.  You know what I take away from that is he had no idea that you were called Deacon in your  playing days.  Because he's just a young kid, probably. 
[00:53:00]  He's your age.  Yeah, but I know Deacon Jones.  Everyone knew him.  Everyone knows Deacon Jones.  Who doesn't know Deacon Jones?  Hall of Famer?  I think you went in in, what, 1980, around there?  My first year of eligibility.  1980, right?  See?  I know my stuff.  That was a good guess.  There you go, O.  Yeah.  How'd you read that?  That guy sounds like a second-page faggot, and I don't like the fact that he wrote that  about you.  You wait till you get down here.  You'll watch how I deal with that.  All right.  You'll be here.  Well, we'll let Deacon go unless you want to hang out, but we're going to take a break  or something.  Deacon, thank you so much for hanging out. 
[00:53:30]  I'm looking forward to seeing you play a little poker out there.  You ain't going to have a chance to see me.  Oh, I'm going to be gone before.  You do seem much more nervous than he does.  He seems much more confident.  He's Deacon Jones.  All right, let's come down, man.  Look at the sweat coming off his head.  He's very nervous.  I danced every week with more thousands and millions of people.  Right.  Right.  That's true.  Deacon's very nervous.  He does sweat like Ben, but he's got a lot of sweat going on.  What do you think I'm going to do with this little crowd?  Really?  All right.  I might leave because I ain't up in the crowd.  You like ice cream, Doc?  Deacon, you're going to have to give up your microphone because we have a big star here  waiting to talk to us.  You ever see Rich Voss? 
[00:54:00]  That's a huge star.  Uh-oh.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Take it easy, Deacon.  Take it easy.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  He must mean something to somebody.  I never heard of the name.  I got it.  But I'm going to look it up when I get home.  Oh, damn.  I really did not know.  He was a star, you said?  Yeah.  In his own mind, Deacon.  In his own mind.  Oh, one of those guys.  Come on, sit down, big guy.  Let me hear you interview. 
[00:54:30]  Let me hear you interview.  Well, why you got the press thing on?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Wait, give Deacon the microphone.  Yeah, don't take Deacon's beer.  What are you, insane?  Yeah.  Ben?  Guys, guys.  Just move the water.  Guys, you can't hear me.  Let's sell Boston.  Are you with these guys?  Deacon.  He was...  Are you embarrassed, Dutch?  Deacon, Deacon.  He was off to the side getting all pissed off that we weren't getting him on the show fast  enough.  He's like, who is this Deacon guy?  I don't know who the hell he is.  I got things to do, places to be. 
[00:55:00]  I thought he was Lou Rawls.  I've been called that before.  My lady, though.  Hold on.  We might want to give Rich Voss a mic.  Lou Rawls is very talented.  All right, hold on.  Let's get Rich Voss a mic.  Do a nice big business, buddy.  What's that buzzing frigging...  You know what that is?  It's a phone ringing, sir.  Don't...  Whose phone is that?  Everyone turn off their phones.  How long have y'all been on the air, man?  How long has it seemed like?  We can't hear you.  We can't hear you, Voss. 
[00:55:30]  I'll tell you what.  Anybody can get a radio show.  I'm putting my beard in right now.  I want to get on satellite.  I might replace you guys.  Well, we thought it would be fun to have a little interaction between Deacon and Rich,  but I don't think the mic's working.  That's fine.  It's not working.  It's not working.  We'll work on that.  All right.  No, Deacon, thank you so much.  Deacon, thanks, man.  And the best of luck out there on the floor.  What are you saying, Voss?  Who the hell is this guy?  That's Rich Voss.  Big star.  Big star.  He's writing for Chris Rock.  He's writing for Chris Rock.  He's writing for Chris Rock in the Oscars, and he's the world's tallest midget. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, man.  You ought to clean that act up.  That's some of the worst language I ever heard in my life.  You and Chris Rock?  Uh-oh.  What's that mean?  Wait, I'm thinking of what you're writing.  I'm writing for the Oscars now, but what are you talking about his language?  Oh, you don't like Chris Rock?  You know, I didn't say I didn't like Chris Rock, but his language stinks.  How are you going to get me beat up over the Oscars?  Yeah, why are you doing it?  Rich, why are you writing stuff?  There's a white guy writing.  I know.  Wait, Deacon.  You got a white guy writing for me.  You're writing all that old bad language.  That's what I said.  It makes him look bad.  Hold on, Deacon.  He can look bad. 
[00:56:30]  Deacon, you know that famous bit that Chris Rock does about, you know, it was Rich Voss.  Get the hell out of here.  Get the hell out of here.  Look at how scared Rich is.  He's all red and steel.  You know the bit.  Deacon, you know the bit.  Yeah, he's standing up.  Believe it or not.  That's a great bit.  I don't want to take credit for it.  Oh, sure.  That's all.  You tell Chris to keep on pushing because I like his stuff. 
[00:57:00]  There you go.  I like his stuff.  And that academy is dull as hell anyway.  They need some activity.  I think I'm going to put my bid in to host the sucker next year.  I think it's bad now.  You wait.  All right.  Then he's going to turn into the source of words.  Deacon Jones.  Deacon Jones, everyone.  Fantastic, man.  Thank you.  Who knew?  Who knew that Deacon could do radio, man?  That was hilarious.  Thank you, Deacon.  Where the hell is your money?  Yeah, who handles the money?  That's who I want to do.  Oh, who handles it?  No one.  All right.  He's just bowing.  I know.  We just do this.  Then you've got to give him a microphone if he's going to keep talking. 
[00:57:30]  There you go.  All right.  He's gone.  Deacon.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All righty.  Deacon was a lot of fun.  Deacon Jones rocked.  Absolutely rocked.  So, all right.  We're at the World Poker Tournament.  World Poker Tour.  Tour.  I'm sorry.  I keep saying tournament.  It's the Invitational.  World Poker Tour.  I'm sorry.  Well, we've got a little NFL thing as we go to break.  It will continue.  Stay there.  It's coming to the Gay Channel.  What is up?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up. 
[00:58:00]  Whittier Hall's John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning.  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairies.  Just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz. 
[00:58:30]  That was the right one.  That one didn't cover, didn't cover, didn't cover.  And finally, they threw it out of there.  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old beaten lob.  Oh, what a meal those guys are having.  They look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts...  You push, you push, you push...  ...get gay per view today.  You just rode him backwards.  You just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle. 
[00:59:00]  The second annual male group orgy competition on gay per view.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Floyd, yeah.  He's going to fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  Broadcasting conversation from a locker room.  Everybody was drunk and having sex and shooting guns.  I'm thrilled, I'm excited, I'm ecstatic.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California.  Be happy, be sad, be broke. 
[00:59:30]  El virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Live from Los Angeles, California.  Live from L.A.  Where the hell are we again at the Commerce Casino? 
[01:00:00]  Thank you, Anthony.  And we're here for what?  The World Poker Tour Invitational.  And you're going to be playing with these animals soon?  Yes, I will be right there at table 14 when this thing kicks off.  They're saying about 2 o'clock Pacific.  So that's 5 o'clock Eastern that the festivities should be getting underway.  But...  No way.  There's no one even in here yet.  They said it might be a little later than that.  Hey, we lost Jim Norton. 
[01:00:30]  Norton's running around.  And we asked, what is he doing?  And Ben goes, he's looking for celebrities to take his picture with.  Did you get any?  There's nobody here yet.  There's no one here yet.  Let me explain, Jim Norton.  His third priority when we're on the road is to do the radio show.  His first priority is to get laid.  So he's probably already combed the whole area to make sure there's no strippers or whores around.  And then his second priority is to get his celebrity photos.  And then the third priority, if he has any time left and he's feeling it, he'll do the actual radio show.  That's not true.  You guys are definitely second behind the celebrity photos. 
[01:01:00]  Dude, you ran off to get pictures done.  But there was no one out there.  But Steve walked over and goes, oh my God, there are some celebrities outside.  And I walked out.  Yes, you did.  It was either you or Ben.  All right, get the microphone.  So Deacon Jones was hilarious, huh?  He was very funny.  God damn, was that good.  And we set up Rich Voss great.  I thought Rich Voss was going to get his face smashed.  I didn't write that.  I was selling you down the river.  Like, yeah, I know.  He always says that about steroids.  Anything that...  I know.  He was selling you down the river.  Voss, you could see his heart went up into his throat.  Because Deacon Jones couldn't believe, first of all, that Rich Voss was standing. 
[01:01:30]  He towered over him.  Yeah.  Deacon, he said, what, 6'5", 6'6".  Voss's top's 5'3 1⁄2".  See his hands?  Yeah.  His hands are like huge.  His hands were as big as my whole hand.  And meat fist.  Yeah, so.  Anyway, where did Voss go?  He went outside.  We were going to go out there and take some celebrity pics, but there were none.  There was no one out there.  You went out there to get pictures with celebrities?  Of course.  He went out there trying to be a celebrity so people would take pictures with him, and  it's just not panning him.  No one recognizes him anywhere.  No, of course not.  No, he's leaning up against the wall hoping someone will come up to him and say, hey, can  I have my picture taken with you?  He's trying to tell me that Vince Vaughn recognized him last night. 
[01:02:00]  No, he didn't.  He's actually trying to tell me that Vince Vaughn recognized him, came over and shook his  hand.  He probably mixed him up with some Puerto Rican he met one time.  Like, oh yeah, didn't I meet you one down in the barrio?  All right.  Well, I think we got all the microphones finally working and everything is rocking and rolling.  Oh, we got the other one?  That one works now?  Yeah, I guess it works now.  Okay.  I got to give props to little Jimmy Norton.  We were flying out of Newark yesterday to L.A., and all of a sudden I'm walking through  the first class section, and all of a sudden I see Jimmy grabbing all his bags and going 
[01:02:30]  back with the rowers, as we like to call them.  The rowers and coach.  And I go, Jimmy, where are you going?  He goes, oh, dude, it's Steve's birthday.  I'm giving him my first class seat.  I thought that was cool as hell.  Well, you weren't there for the debate that went on in his head for about an hour.  Oh, really?  Of course.  He's pacing in first class, pacing.  I'm just sitting there, and he keeps going, should I, you know, I kind of want to, you  know, for his birthday, I'll switch seats with him so he's up in first class.  And I'm like, you're a better man than I. 
[01:03:00]  What was business first, which is much bigger seats?  Well, yeah, because Kenny.  This first class section was ridiculous huge.  Well, it had the sleeper seats, and Kenny's like, wow, Norton would never give up a sleeper  seat ever.  Sleeper seat and dinner was just, dude, they pass around a menu on Continental.  A menu that you choose what you want from it, and it's like a restaurant menu.  There was one of those in Coach, too, but it was a picture of the sandwich, or an arrow  pointing at the toilet, saying you have two choices. 
[01:03:30]  You eat this, or you go scoop out of that and munch down.  I felt so, not bad for Jimmy, because he put himself in that situation.  It's a very honorable thing to do, very nice for Steve's birthday.  So I figured I'd do something for him, and when my ice cream sundae came, I figured I'd  walk it back there to Jimmy.  So I come back, and I look at Jimmy.  He's got his laptop out, but the seat in front of his is pushed so far back that he can't  look at the screen, because it's angled downward, the screen of his laptop. 
[01:04:00]  He almost needed a mirror to reflect what was being seen from down.  Yeah, it was the worst seat I've ever seen on a plane.  And what happened was, we were all eating something in Gallagher's Steakhouse, just having  a little appetizer before the flight, and Ben was kind of joking.  He goes, oh, it's Steve's birthday.  You give him your seat.  Like, it's a joke.  And I started to think, wow, why don't I?  It is his birthday.  And the whole time, I'm like, yeah, maybe I'm going to do that.  And I get on, and I see how big the seats are.  And I'm like, Jesus, we're not that close.  I mean, it's his birthday, but, you know, fuck him.  It wasn't just, you know, it was totally unexpected. 
[01:04:30]  I was sat, I was all the way back in row 35, just getting myself configured, and Jimmy comes  back, takes a look at the area, says hello, then walks back.  Well, I was just seeing the seats, how big they were.  I was doing a survey.  And I'm such an ass.  I'm thinking that you might have went back to say something to Steve, and you saw that  he was going to be sitting next to a really hot piece of ass, and that's why he did it.  Oh, some type of...  Yeah, I never thought that he actually did it, because he had a good heart.  And I, you know, I was so annoyed, because I kept trying to find a way out of it.  Like, I would have been guilty the whole flight, so I asked the flight attendant.  I'm like, is it okay if I switch my friend and coach? 
[01:05:00]  I was hoping she'd say, no, no, no, F.A. regulations won't allow that, but then she's  like, yeah, and I'm like, ah, fuck.  I keep hoping something will happen that we're not allowed to make the switch.  Oh, turn that off.  Well, we're trying to get messages from Eric, too, so that doesn't really work, though.  Ben, hold on to that.  Yeah, Ben.  Those damn trios make such a noise.  So then I ended up sitting in your seat, and I saw that you left behind some kind of monster  or whatever, the Metallica.  I want to see that so bad, and I'm like, ah, do I go all the way back and give it to  him, or make believe I never saw it, and then pop it in my DVD player. 
[01:05:30]  I'm glad you gave it to me, because I would have had absolutely nothing to do.  And poor Kenny, who is also 6'5", is crammed into the...  Also 6'5", like you're what?  No, with Deacon Jones, I was saying.  Also, Kenny's about the same height.  Yeah.  And he's crammed into a little...  I love Continental, but you've got to get bigger seats.  Yeah, you can coach.  You have to get bigger seats back there.  Well, you know what it is?  They squish coach to make that first class section that much bigger.  And you know what?  You've got to take the hit and lose one row.  You have to lose one row.  Look at you, gunning for the poor people in the back.  For the apes.  I mean, not even people, really.  They're just pretty much talking chimps. 
[01:06:00]  Ballast.  Yeah.  And I was watching a little bit of that Grunge movie on the plane.  Oh, my God, is that movie scary.  On those little screens and the really bad, you know, headphones they give you.  I'm just imagining on my system at home how crazy that movie would be.  The most startling movie you'll ever see.  I had seen it before, and I was looking across the aisle at Anthony, who was watching it,  just waiting to see if he jumped at all those token scary moments.  And he got so jumpy.  Oh, it was very scary.  And you should have...  Kenny was so annoying to the woman next to him. 
[01:06:30]  This big fat cell was sitting in between him and Ben.  And Ben, of course, three minutes into the flight, his Mount Rushmore head tilts to the left,  and he's asleep.  And Kenny is just talking to the girl on his right, and he's just annoying her.  Where are you from?  And she's like, oh, I'm from Poughkeepsie.  He's like, you live on a farm?  He was the most annoying man.  Very good.  We have a guest.  Yes.  Who?  Kelly Packard, right?  From Baywatch?  Yes.  I recognize her.  Yes.  Of course.  Why don't we have an additional seat?  Yeah, why don't we get a seat for the guest?  Let's get a seat for a guest. 
[01:07:00]  Here, Miss, take my seat.  Jimmy, that's very nice of you.  Give her the comfier of the two seats.  Yeah, why don't you take that one?  I'll take the hard one.  That's very generous of you, Jimmy.  I was actually putting it right here.  All right.  Hi, Kelly.  Hello.  He's dirty.  Kelly Packard from Baywatch.  Of course.  And also, what was that other show you were on?  Uh-oh.  Ripley's.  Ripley's, that's right.  Okay, and I thought, right, right on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I like the Ripley's, believe it or not.  I haven't seen the new version, though.  I used to watch the old version. 
[01:07:30]  The old version with Jack Palance?  Jack Palance.  Yeah.  That was it.  That's a good time.  Maybe he'd be like, believe it or not.  Or not.  Yeah.  I always tried to squeeze that into that.  Kelly, please don't do that.  Yeah.  It doesn't work.  You need to be Jack Palance for that one.  But, man, watching Ripley's, I remember it was one of those.  It was pretty much the first show you couldn't eat while you were watching TV.  Now, you know, with all the reality shows and stuff.  Yeah, now it's nothing.  Yeah, like Fear Factor and stuff.  It's nothing.  But back then, I could not watch that show and eat at the same time because some of the  eating things, you know, they come out with people, you know.  My favorite, well, the only one that really got to me, my stomach, was a guy that ate 
[01:08:00]  things and then stuck a vacuum down his esophagus and vacuumed it back up.  That was the only one that got to me.  The hanging from their flesh, all the other things I saw, that was nothing.  Yeah.  This guy.  Yeah, they come out and do weird things to their body too, like hanging themselves.  Yeah, I love that.  What was the one guy that was on?  He had this weird oil behind his ear and he'd rub it and he'd smell it and people would  get nauseous.  Rich Voss, I think his name was.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  I remember reading it in the book, you know, all those books that would come out that were 
[01:08:30]  pleased, believe it or not.  Very entertaining.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Baywatch, of course.  Yeah, Baywatch.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  But here I am playing poker.  And now poker.  Are you a poker player?  I am.  You know, I don't tell anyone I'm going to play the card, like, what am I doing?  But yeah.  Is that your strategy?  That's my strategy.  Yeah.  It'll work.  Do you play a lot of poker?  I've never done professional, but yes, I've been playing since I was five.  Since you were five?  Yeah.  My dad taught me really young.  Anthony's playing too, so.  I know.  Yeah, I'm going to be out there.  Are you?  Yeah.  I don't expect much out of myself, but hopefully I'll surprise myself. 
[01:09:00]  It's going to be fun.  But now, I've been playing poker, too, for my whole life, but Hold'em's been around forever.  But as far as being very popular, it's only been recent.  It's only been recent, yeah.  Have you played Hold'em for a long time?  That's been more recent.  Yeah.  I've been dying to get, like, this huge hit show so I can be on Celebrity Poker Showdown.  How pathetic is that?  But here I am doing this instead.  You don't need a big hit show because Colin Quinn was on it.  So believe me.  I'm just kidding.  If Colin's on, you're like, wait, I'm bigger than that guy.  Colin, it upsets you that some people get on there. 
[01:09:30]  It's like, Donny Deutsch.  I mean, he's a nice enough guy, but Jesus.  Come on.  Celebrity poker.  I'm excited to do this.  Yeah.  Do you usually do well when you play?  You know, I do.  When I'm amongst my friends, celebrities or not, I usually take the night.  What's the strategy?  Again, I'm going to play under the radar.  They are, and I think that's going to get me farther than I'm hoping it will because  otherwise I play pretty fierce, but I think today I'm going to play more conservative  and just try to get as far as I can at first and save the fierceness for the end.  Do you think you're a good bluffer? 
[01:10:00]  I'm a great bluffer.  Are you really?  All poker is is acting and luck.  There's a little skill, but it's really, if you think about it, a lot of acting.  Yeah.  So I can call the bluffers out on, like, Poker Showdown or whatever in a heartbeat.  Wow.  That's tough.  See, another tough one.  When I get nervous, I get beet red all down my chest, so turtleneck.  Had to wear it.  Look at that.  She's thinking ahead with her clothing.  Yeah, she's going to be that or a scarf, and I thought that would look ridiculous.  You don't have any tells, though, as far as, you know, you just keep it.  My husband may think he knows my tells, but he doesn't. 
[01:10:30]  He's told you you have tells?  Yeah.  Try to keep you from doing them?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know what table you're at?  I am.  I'm at 21.  21?  C8.  Okay.  So 21, lucky blackjack.  I'm at 14, so I don't have to.  We can wave.  Yeah, we can wave and stuff, and if we get lucky.  Maybe we'll meet up at a table.  Perhaps later at a table.  Any advice to Anthony?  Because this is his first.  My first tournament.  Oh, it was your first tournament?  Yeah.  Play under the radar like me.  I think it's going to get us far.  That's what I figured I was going to do.  Yeah.  I figured maybe I'll let some of the predators really knock out some of the people that are  being silly.  Yeah, exactly.  And then sit back, and then, you know, play some good cards. 
[01:11:00]  That's exactly right.  And obviously, I mean, if you get lucky cards, play them, and play them to the fullest.  Right, right.  Do you think they're going to underestimate you because you're a woman?  They absolutely are.  You know something?  And I'm prepared for that.  I've watched a lot of the tournaments on TV, and the women do very, very well.  They do.  They do.  And it's amazing.  A lot of the times watching the celebrity poker, you watch these people walk away, and  there's the girl at the table.  That's right.  Because they get distracted.  No, because guys are so visual.  You're also...  It can't possibly be that they're good poker players.  I know that's a bad thing to say, but I'm just thinking, like, in my stupid brain, I'd 
[01:11:30]  be like, oh, screw the game.  Look how hard she is.  This should be your talent.  Maybe I should work that way.  Every time you have a good hand, you flash, and the other retards will just drop those cards  on the table.  You can see what they have.  I can see them all.  That's classic.  There you go.  Do you have a gimmick or any...  I mean, some of these guys have the gimmick.  You don't play the gimmick angle?  No.  The Unabomber, you know, he's got the hood.  I thought about, you know, I thought about being silly today and doing something like that,  but then I just...  I'm going to just play. 
[01:12:00]  I'm just going to play, and that'll make me even look more like I don't know what I'm  doing, you know?  You know who's a good player?  What's her name from American Pie?  Elizabeth.  Shannon Elizabeth.  Shannon Elizabeth.  Yes, I've watched her play here.  She's good.  I watched her, but she is really goofy.  Really?  She was lighting sage and letting it smoke around her to cleanse her area.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  But she's so attractive that it didn't matter.  I should have asked about that.  You know, if she wasn't that attractive, people would have gone over and go, hey, kook.  Sit down.  You know, there's probably fire codes she's breaking, but everyone's just like, oh, 
[01:12:30]  she's adorable.  Let her burn the place down.  We don't care.  Kathy Baselet says that an attacker with a fire extinguisher.  I love it.  You fat pig, you're going to kill us all.  Oh, you're terrible, Jimmy.  Oh, well, hopefully we'll see you at a finals table.  Yeah, Mina Savari.  She's very good at overall.  Yeah, is she good, too?  Yeah.  I've seen her play.  All right.  I think the girls are just going to dominate today.  Some of the girls are very ruthless.  We'll have to wait and see.  We're hoping Anthony could survive a little of the way. 
[01:13:00]  You know something?  If I make it through the first table, I'll be very pleased with myself and very surprised  because I'm just, you know, you never want to be that first one out.  I know.  Not only at the table, but imagine the first guy out in the whole tournament.  I don't want to be that guy.  If that happens, I'll just, I'll have to, because I'm a poor loser.  I really am.  I think I'll be pissed if they deal me like pocket aces the first hand because I'm like,  I've got to play them.  Yeah.  You know?  I want to get like a seven deuce offsuit.  You can go all in right away if you have pocket aces.  That's just it.  Now, what do you do? 
[01:13:30]  I wouldn't.  It's the first hand.  The first hand.  Don't.  I know.  Because I don't want to go out on the first hand.  Right.  So you're going to take a beautiful hand and just waste it.  Yep.  Or slow play it, maybe.  See, I can't play poker.  I would have to.  You would just go all in.  You wouldn't have to.  Oh, wow.  That's why I'm hoping for a lot of bad offsuits and just, you know, oh, oh, oh, all right.  I'm in looking around the room to see if anybody's walking away.  All right.  I won't be the first guy.  What season of Baywatch?  I did season seven and eight.  So right after Pam left, Carmen Electra's first year, it was her and I. 
[01:14:00]  I don't watch Baywatch, but a friend of mine watched it.  He said like the Carmen Electra years were really good.  And I'm like, you think so?  And he's like, mm.  Yeah.  Well, it had her on it.  Wouldn't they be good?  No, they were very good.  The best years, I think.  Well, when I was on it.  Okay.  No, he liked it better.  It actually progressively got better.  I agree.  But I hadn't seen it.  I have to agree.  Can I, it's a little weird, but this is Jim Norton.  He does a show with us, obviously.  He's a pretty famous comic.  Hi.  Hi.  And things like that.  But there's something about his body that just drives us nuts. 
[01:14:30]  Do you mind, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  It's embarrassing.  It's just his arm.  He doesn't have much hair on his arm.  Look at it.  Look how hairless.  Look how hairless it is.  Look how hairless it is.  Now, do you wax?  No, I don't have to.  That's just naturally wax.  I'm just a hairless lad.  Yeah, I've always been that way.  Yeah.  Very popular with the camp counselors.  He's like a little, he's like the popping fresh dough boy.  He's just hairless.  You're poking and goes, hee, hee, hee.  Nothing wrong with that. 
[01:15:00]  All right, Kelly.  Good luck to you today, man.  Thank you.  Kelly, thanks for stopping by.  Good luck.  Thanks a lot.  I need it.  I have a picture with you on the floor.  Of course, Ken.  All right.  There she goes.  Kelly Packard, Anthony.  We're going to go right to David Stein, World Poker Radio.  Does the World Poker Radio, Anthony?  Here he is.  Fellas.  Hey, David.  How are you doing, man?  I'm doing great.  Good luck.  Nice to be here.  This is kind of exciting.  I've got to tell you, I didn't expect this.  I have no idea.  I take a peek every once in a while, but the setup is amazing here.  I'm a huge fan.  You know, it's always watching all the tournaments.  I hooked up with the tour just to see Shauna Hyatt. 
[01:15:30]  So, you know, it has nothing to do with the cards.  Yep.  Saw her by the front door before.  Did you see her, have you seen her Playboy layout?  Get out of here, really?  Yeah.  When she was 19.  Stop it.  And I don't want to give away her age right now, but it's been a couple of years.  She looks better now than she did at 19.  Well, yeah.  I'm going to have to check that out now.  I thought we'd start out with chicks.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton is funny.  That guy's a flat-out funny guy.  Isn't he?  Yes.  We love little Jimmy here on the program. 
[01:16:00]  And he's got more hair than me, so.  Well, not really, man.  He keeps it tight.  Maybe on his head, but the rest of his body has nothing.  Pretty hairless.  I really am a mess.  I don't want to know why you know that, but go ahead.  I'm walking off a spaceship in a Spielberg movie.  Smooth and nothing.  Actually, I helped him out a little bit with one of his comedy CDs, and I'll tell you why.  Because we went to this photo shoot where he had to get just in his tighty-whities and pull them up as high as he possibly could, and he's completely naked.  Like a wedgie?  Yeah, just completely up, almost up to his nipples, and that's some of the photos that are inside his CD. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, that's just a visual that I was hoping to get to.  Thank you.  Just to wreck that hot visual you gave us with the hot chicks.  Yeah.  So, are there any celebrities out there?  Yeah, there are quite a few.  Oh, who's out there?  I saw Norm MacDonald.  Okay.  And I was digging listening to Norm MacDonald talk.  I think we're going to get Norm on the show.  Okay, cool.  I want to see who's out there.  We're going to have Norm in a few minutes, I think.  So, is it going to be between you and me to see who gets up out of the tournament first?  I don't know.  What table are you at? 
[01:17:00]  I'm at table two.  Table two?  I'm at table two.  I'm at 14.  Yeah, how confident are you?  I was listening to you talk to the hot chick about the pocket aces.  I don't know what happens if you get out.  What do you do?  First hand, first deal, boom, you get a great hand.  I'm going to slow play it.  You're going to slow play it.  Yeah.  Not because you think you should, but because you think, I don't want to be out.  Exactly.  Although, you could double up right there.  It would be embarrassing for the World PokerCore Radio guy to be out on the first hand.  Right, exactly.  Imagine the pressure that would be off of you, though, if you could double up on that first 
[01:17:30]  hand.  You could sit back and caroose for a while, you know?  Or knock everybody at the table out.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Start pressuring them a little bit with your big stack.  It might be the right strategy, but like you said, I think it would be more of a slow  play just out of fear that you're going to screw up.  Somebody's holding a, you know, maybe somebody else.  It's very nerve-wracking going into this tournament.  Well, especially for a stalker like me.  Yeah.  Because there's so many potential victims. 
[01:18:00]  Have you ever done tournament playing?  I played in one tournament, I played in one tournament, and crapped in my pants.  Did you?  Yeah.  That's definitely a tell.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm learning the terminology myself.  I think that's a tell.  Does he blink his nose?  He fills his socks with shit.  Anthony, I mean, you don't have high expectations, though.  You just don't want to be the first guy out.  I just don't want to be the first out.  You know what?  Probably the worst thing that could happen is if I do well and start, you know, working 
[01:18:30]  your way up.  You get through the first table.  If you can knock out one table, then you start thinking in your head, hey, maybe I can do  this.  Oh, it's like making the turn in golf, even.  Right, right.  Hey, I'm going to shoot the course record.  Yeah, and then you fall apart.  Is there a pro at every table, though?  Or how is this working?  I don't know how they're working.  I don't know how it's spread out, but generally, at something like this, they would spread the pros  out.  Yeah, but I don't think there's that many pros for how many tables they got at the first  table.  I think the first round, there's going to be some saps out there and some people that know 
[01:19:00]  how to play poker, you know, moderately.  How do you think you do?  Do you usually do well when you're playing?  You know, it's really something that I'm not really going to talk about right now.  Oh, keeping it close to the best.  A little poker face there.  I'm going to kick everybody's ass.  There you go.  Confidence.  That's how I'm going to go out.  Do you play online at all?  Oh, no, that's scary.  Yeah.  I've done that.  Yeah.  I've done that.  But you know, a really interesting thing, and we did one of our poker features for World  Poker Tour Radio on this, a lot of guys are playing online, and they're sitting there 
[01:19:30]  going through two packs of cigarettes.  They think they're hot crap, and all of a sudden, they come to a tournament, especially  in California, where you can't smoke, and they're out in the first round.  Ah, because they're just doing it for a cigarette.  Absolutely.  Distracts them.  Playing online is completely different.  You know, guys are touching themselves at home, and it's not that I haven't done that  at a tournament here.  Porn in another window on your computer.  In a real tournament, you can't just close the box for a minute, jack off the donkey porn,  and then go back up. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  The key to tournament play is, for guys like you and me, that don't play professionally,  is, and I'll go back to the golf analogy, don't have too many thoughts in your head.  When you go out to the driving range, you've got 17 different swing thoughts.  When you get out to the course, two swing thoughts.  So go out there with just one or two strategies, and if they work, they work.  If you get some cards, terrific.  That's it.  Right on.  Well, we've got to take a quick break.  You're going to be around the area, so...  I'm going to be around the area, and I might be standing up from those tables faster than  you might think. 
[01:20:30]  Very nice.  Oh, look who's next, Anthony.  Yes.  The founder of the World Poker Tour.  Yes.  After the break, it's the Opie and Anthony program, live from Los Angeles.  Nice.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  What are you talking about?  I sit here, I make some asinine comments, and I check the computer.  And you're a good squeezer.  Yeah.  It is insane. 
[01:21:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello, hello, hello.  Man, please don't let it go.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  So, chill.  Give me something.  I can see you.  Feel you.  Yeah.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program, live from Los Angeles with the whole gang. 
[01:21:30]  Anthony's going to be playing in the door in a few minutes here.  Well, I guess they're saying 2 o'clock, but that's not going to be the case, right?  Who are we kidding?  Come on.  This is television.  It never starts on time.  Of course not.  What time do you think I'll be kicking off?  6, 7 o'clock tonight.  We should get started.  It'll happen right around soon.  We'll be 2 o'clock.  Yeah.  All right.  Very cool.  We're talking to Steve, founder of the World Poker Tour.  I was going to say your last name, but I probably would butcher it.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Go ahead.  Steve Lipscomb.  That's perfect.  Dear God.  Well butchered.  I got one right.  Okay, stop.  Thanks for the program.  Well butchered.  Yeah.  He's the founder of the World Poker Tour.  And that sounds like it would be something easy to do in hindsight.  But really, years ago, nobody sat around and watched other people play poker.  Look, it had been on television for years and nobody watched it.  No one remembers that.  It was uninteresting to watch.  It was like watching paint dry.  And basically, 2001, the poker industry was in decline, if you can believe it. 
[01:22:30]  People were still playing at home, but they were closing card rooms all across the country.  Now these televised events, how many people would actually show up to play at these things?  Foxwoods, I'll give you an example.  One that we just had this year, the year before we did it, their $10,000 event had 34 people in it.  We had 674 this year.  Wow.  So that's nearly $7 million in prize money, almost as much as we did our whole first season.  Well, what changed?  The World Poker Tour.  Literally. 
[01:23:00]  What we did in eight months of editing our first show is created, invented a formula that made this interesting television.  I mean, you guys know media is what it's about.  So whether it's radio or television, television is a powerful thing.  So what it's done is kind of into people's homes now.  This is a great spectator sport.  And now people are flooding into the casinos to play.  Well, seeing those whole cards, that's huge.  And that's us.  You know, the first time that was ever done on U.S. television, we did it.  And even more important than that, now you graphically, you watch it play. 
[01:23:30]  So, you know, once upon a time, if you watch, believe me, if you or I watched the way that poker was done before,  and you tried to turn the sound off, forget it.  Because I had to describe everything to you.  I had to say, okay, this is really an interesting hand.  And let me tell you why it's an interesting hand.  Why it's interesting.  I'm going to come in right now.  Oh, isn't that exciting?  But now, basically, you can follow with the graphics what people are doing.  And you go through airports, you see this stuff on mute, and you can follow what's going on.  Right, right.  And basketball, you could do that anyway, right?  Basketball, football, all those sports.  A guy's got a ball, it's going in the hoop or it's not. 
[01:24:00]  Poker's got a lot more, right?  Now, how do these superstars, you know, the names, how are they reacting to the popularity?  Because for years, I mean, these guys are schlepping around, eking out a living, playing poker.  And now it's not even about their winnings and their purses.  These guys are getting endorsement deals.  These guys are, they're rock stars now walking around.  How are they handling the whole situation?  Like every celebrity, they're awful.  They're taller.  I can't say.  Are you kidding me?  Who are you kidding?  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:30]  You know how you used to be?  Take a poker player and make him a celeb and see what you get.  Yeah, I've got to tell you, really, when we started the World Poker Tour and before we started hitting Wednesday nights on the Travel Channel in prime time,  these guys literally were the black sheep to their family.  At our first final table at Bellagio, two of the six finalists hadn't told their families what they did for a living.  Think about that.  Sure.  The six.  Now, literally, these guys are walking through airports.  They can't make it through because they have to sign autographs.  And there they hit the family reunion.  So the change in two years is phenomenal. 
[01:25:00]  It used to be, you know, they were the scourge.  They were, you know, no one made a living playing poker.  You do what for a living?  Now, you know, you do talk shows, et cetera, and the calls that you get from people are saying,  now, you know, how can I get into being a professional poker player?  It's this kind of new American dream is somebody's going to come on the World Poker Tour and be one of our, this season,  17 millionaires that we're going to make.  17 millionaires with $70 to $90 million of prize money.  I mean, it's the first sport ever that you or I can go play in. 
[01:25:30]  You're going to do it today for guys.  I know.  That's why it's one of those dream come true things.  This is, I've been watching for years, you know, for the past couple of years anyway.  And who's able to then step out on the field and actually play on the same playing field as these guys?  And who'd care to?  Like, if you and I could step on the all-star game, if last week at the NBA they would have let us stand on the court.  That was my sport growing up.  We wouldn't want to.  I can't even imagine this all saying, hey, shooting hoops with LeBron James. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I could hang on there.  Get out there.  Go ahead.  But here's the difference.  It would be utterly embarrassing.  Like, if they let me on the court, I'd probably go just because I couldn't help myself, right?  But I would be utterly embarrassed.  When you play there today, you've got a legitimate shot.  And every time the World Poker Tour airs, you know, on Wednesday night, every time you watch it, you've got the Cinderella story.  You've got somebody that's been playing for two months and has been playing.  They come in and play against the biggest players in the world, and they've actually got a shot and make it to the final table.  I've seen a couple of people at the final table that are just amateurs, you know, coming up.  They got a little luck, and they're sitting there with the superstars. 
[01:26:30]  And we structured this for you, brother.  Today it's a fast structure, which means all those guys will piss and moan  because they're not happy with the fact that it goes fast.  But people who haven't been playing in a long time have a shot because it's going to happen pretty quickly.  And Anthony just doesn't want to be the first guy out today.  That's pretty much all, right?  I'm hoping.  You're pretty much destined to go out first, then.  Yeah, I know.  You're as good as gone.  He was telling us just before we went back on air here that Norm Macdonald was the first guy out last year.  Yeah, he's really proud of that.  When you talk to him later, I'm sure you're going to hear it.  Yeah, he's coming in in a few minutes here, hopefully. 
[01:27:00]  He'll be on the show, but he was the first guy out last year.  Yeah, and, you know, he'll tell you the story.  It's the classic is nobody, no poker player in the world who would have played it any differently than him.  He had King, second best hand, and literally right at the beginning.  And the other guy brought him in, and he was up against aces, and the aces held up.  See?  You know, you get one of those hands.  As simple as it goes, yeah.  That's why I'm hoping to get a seven-deuce offsuit.  You don't want to know.  I just can push it away.  Here's the advice, right?  You've got the beginning is for the first two hours, you do not have to play a frigging hand.  You don't have to touch your cards. 
[01:27:30]  And so remember, you want to just trap the other guy, and you'll be fine.  There you go.  You'll be fine.  And that was pretty much my strategy.  I want to sit back.  I want to, you know, let some of the predators knock out some of the people that are being a little overzealous.  And then I'll get in.  I'll learn a little something.  I'll play some only the really good hands.  Yeah, he's going out first.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Look at me talking smack.  He's pretty much gone.  That's it.  He started the broadcast really nervous.  I see his confidence level slowly returning.  Believe me, it's not a confidence level.  I'm going to be screaming, I'm king of the world standing under your chair. 
[01:28:00]  Can you drink out there, too?  Can I drink?  I can drink anywhere I go.  But, I mean, are the players allowed to drink?  Absolutely.  Okay.  Absolutely.  No, I'm going to keep it too much.  It's even encouraged.  But, you know, to tell you the truth, in poker, it's one of those kinds of things where usually people don't.  And what you'll see almost everybody drinking will be water.  Yep.  Or club soda.  People are just, or club soda, simply because you want to keep your wits about you.  This is no limit Texas Hold'em, man.  Should Anthony have a gimmick?  He should.  You know, I think we should give him one.  A gimmick.  I don't want a gimmick.  I love the gimmick. 
[01:28:30]  We spent the last two weeks off and on on the radio show trying to, you know, find a gimmick for anything.  Like, I will not have a gimmick.  Some kind of silly little thing.  No, I got it.  You could do a Rain Man thing.  Just, like, repeat everything when you come because they're going to think you're insane.  And you've got an advantage.  What was the silliest gimmick you've seen over the years?  I won't tell you the silliest.  I'll tell you the most successful, and it may be the silliest.  The guy, Phil Locke, who is the Unabomber.  Unabomber.  You know, which, by the way, we get lots of flack for.  But he was on one show, and because of his look, he's instant career. 
[01:29:00]  I mean, the guy from that is wandering around.  Does he walk around like that?  And only when he's at, look, he's a nice, good-looking young man.  But all of a sudden, the poker comes on.  He puts his little thing.  And I swear, you know he's going to be in video games before we know him.  Yeah.  And he's a lunatic.  He's insane at the table.  While he was at the table, he came in dodging like he was boxing.  So he knew.  He knew what he was doing.  I am such a newbie at this, but I know who he is.  So you know who he is. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See?  You ever goof on Vince Van Patten about some of his bad 80s and 70s movies?  Oh, my God.  I don't have to.  He goofs on himself.  Does he?  Vince Van Patten is an absolutely fantastic part of what we've done.  I mean, he, from the very beginning, he and Mike Sexton kind of helped us transform the  game so you could understand it.  And there's fun.  We have so much fun doing what we do.  So I give him a tough time, but he's a real pro.  They're actually playing in the...  Yeah, because we got really no worries that they're going to make it to the end. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, because I'm going to say, you know, final table, who's going to host the show?  But no worries about that.  It'll be you with me.  All right.  We'll be out there.  We'll see what we can do.  See, I'm not much of a poker player.  My friend is like a big poker player and he watches it.  And we were talking about tells.  And he said, man, if you have a tell...  That's...  Exactly.  I mean, you know?  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  If he's got a tell...  Yeah.  Here's the scary thing, though.  When you're sitting at the table, you actually, against the great players, you feel exposed. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  One time I felt this sitting with Scotty Winner, where he heads up at the end of a tournament,  just me and him.  And it didn't matter.  I could have handed my chips to him.  I may as well have taken off my clothes off, just given it up, and just said, sure.  Because these guys, they're not just reading your mind.  They're reading your frigging soul.  And I didn't even think I had one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, Steve.  Well, I'm hoping, like I said, not to be the first guy out.  Yes.  Wish me luck.  You won't.  Good luck.  You'll be there.  All right?  Final table.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it. 
[01:31:00]  Thank you.  We're going to move right on.  I mean, the celebrities are, like, just piling up now, Anthony.  I think we've got Rossi Morreale from Junkyard Mega Wars.  Junkyard Mega Wars.  Rossi, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's shaking?  There he is.  Oh, B.  I've seen this guy.  How you doing, man?  Are you here?  Are you playing today?  Jim, how are you doing?  Yes, I am.  You just gave me a sweaty handshake, man.  Are you getting all nervous?  It's a drink, and it's a little wet.  You know, you guys are so intimidating.  Sure are we.  Look at that.  Plus, I saw Jim's routine last year with Jim Florentine in New York.  Oh, where'd you come? 
[01:31:30]  The cellar?  It might have been the cellar.  It might have been.  A routine at a club or them banging a chick?  No, no, no.  It was an interesting routine, to say the least.  Was it me trying to get an erection while Jim banged a girl like a porn star on the next bed?  I think that was disgust.  I missed that one.  That was later in the show.  Oh, dude, you want to feel like a failure.  Watch him bang a girl while you're sitting there with a noodle hanging.  Awful.  Like a mealworm.  I'm going to have to pass on that, Jim.  Thanks for the offer.  Sounds like a good time.  Yeah, he just told that story on the air last week.  He gets naked with his friends all the time.  Anthony and I don't get it. 
[01:32:00]  Apparently.  We've known each other for 10 years, and we haven't been naked in front of each other.  But Jim, it's no problem with him and his boys.  Hey, what table are you at?  Table 23, I believe.  Oh, okay.  I want to seat two.  14 over here.  I'm hoping not to.  How are you feeling?  Let's talk about you.  How are you feeling about playing this thing?  You know something?  Because I've seen this before, I haven't played in it.  I'm not feeling confident.  I don't have any reason to really feel like I'm going to be the first guy out.  But it's poker, man.  I haven't played in any tournaments. 
[01:32:30]  You?  Yeah, I played in this last year.  Oh, you did?  It was my second opponent.  Oh, veteran then.  I played for like four or five hours.  Put out a Richard Karn in like the sixth hand.  Did you?  Yeah.  What finally knocked you out?  He was pissed.  Big blind.  King six.  Holding.  I check.  Ace, king, six.  Comes up in the flop.  This guy is holding aces, which I'm assuming, you know.  Yeah.  Which is great because I'm sitting there with two pair.  Right.  He checks.  I raise.  He goes all in.  I call.  Turn over mine.  He's like, wow, good hand.  Gets up to lead.  I'm just sitting at the chip leader. 
[01:33:00]  Son of a bitch.  He was jerking you.  No, no.  He turns over ace, queen.  I'm like, nice hand.  Next card, seven.  Next card, seven.  His aces and sevens beat my kings and sevens now.  And so I'm gone.  I was like, mother.  So, you know.  What the hell is that?  I had a good time.  You got to turn the trio off.  Get that trio away from here.  I'm going to smash it.  I'm going to smash that thing.  I don't even know if it's that one.  Thank you, Angel Face.  Sorry about that.  You guys are so high tech.  I know.  How many phones?  Whose phone is this?  I know.  I've got to get.  What's going on?  I mean, phones all over.  How much stuff do you guys have around here? 
[01:33:30]  That trio cannot be at this table.  I swear I will smash it.  Thank you, Kenny.  You're welcome.  Starbucks.  Thanks.  You've only been to one tournament before?  Yeah.  I mean, I've got a home game.  I'm playing with all my boys.  I have a philosophy.  Check, fold, and drink.  Why does he get the corona?  Check, fold, and drink.  There you go.  Until you've got something real good.  Yeah.  The way I see it, just stay as long as you can.  You have a better opportunity.  That's what I'm figuring.  You know?  That's it.  Stay there.  Hang out.  Wait for the really good hands.  And hope you're not like Norm Macdonald, which we just heard.  He was knocked out first guy. 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  Knocked out last year.  And they announce it.  Yeah.  Oh, they do?  Which is the, and then you do a big interview, and everyone's watching.  That's where it gets embarrassing.  Dude, if you get knocked out first, you've got to just, you've got to circle, you've just  got to circle all the other tables for us.  And not only get naked in front of your friends, in front of all these people.  Yeah.  And I think that's a big punishment.  Fantastic.  See, I'm not a big poker player, but I've heard, this is true, I get nervous playing,  but my friend plays at home, and he said, when you get into a situation where there  are other people, I mean, you just have to think.  Yeah, it becomes, uh, thinking is key.  I mean, like, it's good, because, I know, I don't know a lot about poker, and I know 
[01:34:30]  that, but he's saying that the setup is going to be very different than at home because  of the cameras and the fact that there's, um, you know, like, all that stuff.  Um, see, I try to, I try to pretend like it's not that, and it is a home game, and I  choose not to think, and like I said, check, fold, and drink.  There you go.  Because it makes it easier, you know?  If you just have, I mean, you have phones, I, I, I, it's almost got so serious, and I got  the glasses and the hat, and I'm, I'm over there cracking up and joking and talking  while they're trying to think.  I mean, it's poker.  It's like bowling.  You don't bowl sober.  You don't golf sober.  I wouldn't play poker sober.  It makes no sense.  Just don't get that serious about it.  You don't have to wear a shirt with your name. 
[01:35:00]  You don't have to go bowl.  You just go out there, you drink your beers, you hunk a ball.  So by showtime, you're going to be blitzed.  Well, we'll keep it, we'll keep it a little bit, you know, calm for a while, but I mean,  I'm not going to sit there, you know, every card and think, oh my gosh, and the  percentages.  I'm going to be like, oh, I've got aces.  You probably don't.  I'm going all in.  If I lose, great.  If not, I'm in, you know?  Well, Anthony said that if he had two aces up, he probably would want to go all in,  but he's afraid that somebody else would wind up, like, trumping that.  Do you think that if you had, like, a really good hand at first hand?  First hand, I mean.  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  First hand.  All in.  What do you do?  Or would you try not to, because, like, what happens if the other guy gets something like 
[01:35:30]  that, and all of a sudden, you're going to be like.  You pull those cards up, you see two aces.  What do you do, man?  I will say, going in, you definitely don't want to put all your chips at risk.  I mean, because you want to hang around.  I mean, that's the whole point of being in.  I'm looking for some crappy hands the first few.  Push it in.  Man, you get aces.  You've got to play them.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Good luck with that.  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  Like, Norm.  I've never won with pocket aces.  Ever.  I know.  I know.  I mean, it's always two pair. 
[01:36:00]  Always something.  Norm got knocked out with kings last year.  He had two kings.  First hand.  And the guy had aces, man.  But what are you going to do?  Not play your kings?  Exactly.  Come on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  First hand.  Hey.  Norm again.  If it happens, Tim, what's you?  You did, and then we'll discuss that.  Exactly.  But as far as a pre-plan, yeah, no idea.  I would say drink.  Drink.  I like his strategy.  Definitely.  I'm going to have to hit on that one.  Do you know who else at your table?  I have no idea.  Okay. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  I probably wouldn't anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rossi, good luck to you, brother.  Good luck.  Appreciate it.  Enjoy that, Corona.  Get ready.  Good to see you, man.  A little junkyard mega wars?  Yeah.  You know, yeah, and whatever.  There's a lot of little stuff going on.  Just see it.  Check it out.  If not, whatever.  Whatever.  Fellas, you guys have a good day.  Good luck to you, man.  Yeah.  Appreciate it.  Do you mind if the guy with the big bulge takes a photo of us?  Look at the front of his pants.  Yeah, look at that.  He's smuggling a bowling ball.  There's a Haitian family in there.  He had to check that at the airport.  Thanks.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Take care, brother.  There you go.  Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan from Fear Factor.  Rogan, how you been, man?  All right.  What's up, Joe?  What's up, Joe?  See you, man?  Oh, man.  I don't play cards.  I just came here for you guys.  You don't play poker?  No, I don't play any games.  Yeah, welcome to the club.  I used to play Quake online.  I was addicted.  Quake?  I get really addicted to games.  I used to play pool like 10 hours a day.  Yeah.  I got addicted to that, so.  I don't have the personality for poker.  I would have to be all in all the time.  I'd be out so fast.  As everyone says, that works every time but one. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, I understand.  Going all in.  So, Joe, it's really funny.  You've made one appearance on our new show so far.  You remember what happened at the end of the show.  The sound cut out.  You were telling the story about Doug Stanhope.  Yeah, Doug Stanhope almost dying.  I probably had a point.  Somewhere in there, right?  No, but here's the deal.  You've got to finish the story because the message boards have gone crazy.  People are wondering what was the end of that story.  Oh, okay.  Because you remember, like, we had to tell you what happened.  When last we left, Doug.  I don't know what the funny part of it was. 
[01:38:00]  Well, just give the full points.  I thought Doug was dead.  Right.  What was the drug?  It's called DMT.  There you go.  It's dimethyltryptamine, and it's actually produced by your pineal gland.  It's like the most powerful psychedelic known to man.  How powerful?  You know that?  It's like if you've ever done acid or you've ever done mushrooms, it's that times like 100,000.  It's like being shot through a can into the center of the universe.  It's the craziest feeling ever.  And when you come out of it, you really, like, understand everything.  And it only lasts for, like, a few minutes where you really feel like you understand everything. 
[01:38:30]  And then your ego grabs a hold of you, and you start redefining your environment and everything again.  But during that experience, while it's going on, you really understand everything.  You're not afraid of death.  You're not afraid of life.  You understand that it all just cycles together.  You're a part of everything.  You feel connected to the air and the fucking table and glasses.  It's the most insane and most enlightened experience.  And Doug almost fucking...  We're talking to Herman Hess all of a sudden.  So Doug is lying on the couch, and I give it to Doug.  And Doug's body is a fucking dumpster.  I love Doug.  Doug smokes as many cigarettes as he can get. 
[01:39:00]  He's like, he doesn't count.  He's like, oh, I need to fuck another pack.  It's not like, oh, I'm trying to cut back.  It's like, can I get another cigarette in my mouth?  Oh, there's a cigarette.  Let me like that.  There's a beer.  Oh, that's another beer.  You've had 18.  Oh, it's another beer.  Look, there's a beer right there.  I'll just drink it.  He doesn't worry at all.  And he's taken this shit.  And I've seen a bunch of people do it.  But I've never seen anybody react like Doug.  Doug started moaning and drool was coming out of his mouth.  He's going, ooh.  I'm going, fuck, he's dead.  And then I'm like, shit, he's so funny. 
[01:39:30]  And then I'm like, shit, what am I going to do with the body?  Because I'm not telling people...  All this racing through your head, yeah.  I gave Doug dimethyltriptamine and he died on my fucking couch.  No, I'm digging a hole in the woods.  He would appreciate that.  I mean, if that was me, if I died at his house, I'd expect him to do the same.  Don't fucking tell the cops he killed me.  Just bury me.  I'm dead.  You fucked up.  It's over, right?  Let's get rid of me.  I died enlightened.  Anyway, he came out of it.  And then he bought it.  Now he does it all the time.  No, he's addicted.  He's like, we need to experiment more with this.  Is it like a drug or does it just tap into that part of you that makes your body creative? 
[01:40:00]  It's forcing that chemical into your brain.  But it's a natural chemical that exists in your brain.  And they think it's responsible for all these alien abduction experiences that people have.  That what they are is actually DMT spikes.  Oh, wow.  And that it happens because they all happen during dream time.  They all happen while you're asleep.  And they happen.  A lot of them are very similar stories.  And there's a guy named Rick Strassman.  He wrote a book called The Spirit Molecule.  And it's all on DMT.  And he was the only man to ever conduct a bunch of clinical, you know, all these different tests and experiments on DMT where they shot it intramuscularly. 
[01:40:30]  They made people smoke it.  All these different ways you can eat it if you eat it with an MAO inhibitor.  You know, and they did all these different types of experiments with DMT.  And they had very similar experiences to people who had alien abduction experiences.  So he believes, as crazy as it sounds, that what DMT is really is it's a portal to another dimension that it tunes you into another frequency.  Because the people share experiences.  Yeah.  That's the craziest thing.  I know that sounds nuts.  But people, if we all did DMT together, we would see the same shit. 
[01:41:00]  We'd be like, dude, what the fuck is that?  Really?  There's a guy talking to us.  There's this little, you ever heard of Terrence McKenna?  Do you know what Terrence McKenna is?  No.  No.  A brilliant guy who was a, you know, what you'd call a psychonaut.  You know, one of those Timothy Leary type guys who just lived his whole life tripping and learning from the experiences and writing books about it and talking about the benefits of mushrooms.  And he actually believes that mushrooms and psilocybin and hallucinogenics in general were responsible for human evolution.  And he's got, like, scientific points to it.  Like, psilocybin in low doses actually increases visual acuity and it makes you hornier. 
[01:41:30]  And that would make, like, a more successful predator.  And he's got all these different, it's fascinating, fascinating shit.  But it's all about, you know, all these stories and all.  It's all about, like, losing the ego through the psychedelic experience.  Wow.  Jesus.  That's out there.  It's heavy, dude.  Once you start doing it, dude, it's really heavy.  And you know what?  It doesn't make you stupid.  You don't feel like shit.  You wake up in the morning, you're not hungover, and you look at everything differently.  I don't recommend it for everybody.  It's not for idiots. 
[01:42:00]  Why don't we do it and do a radio show?  That actually sounded like a rousing endorsement.  Listen, I brought something in just for you guys.  This is just for you guys.  I got this a long time ago, and I saved it, and I brought it in just for you guys, because  you're the only ones who can play it, because it's XM radio.  This is a hardcore gangster rapper called Gangsta Fag.  All right.  Look at this.  Check this out.  It's a guy who talks about sucking my man's dick and no fucking niggas in the ass.  Get out of here.  Oh, he's the guy in L.A.  Oh, wow.  Dude.  It's phenomenal.  It's phenomenal.  Wait, we got a... 
[01:42:30]  Look at it.  He wants it.  Look at it.  He's doing a lot and up the ass.  Dude, the cover is a hardcore...  Folks at home, playing at home.  He's a hardcore black, thugged-out rapper.  A big, muscular dude.  And he's got a gold chain on it.  It says Gangsta Fag.  Yeah, it's gangsta.  It's gangstafag.com, because our listeners...  No, but he doesn't have a website.  He doesn't exist.  I've tried to find this guy, because I wanted to put it on my website, but I didn't want  to get sued.  But I figured, you know what?  Even better than that, let's just play it on the fucking radio.  How perfect would that be?  We'll play it when we get back on Monday.  And I'm going to put it up on... 
[01:43:00]  My website's JoeRogan.net.  I'm going to put it up tonight, so people can download it from my website.  But it's some of the funniest shit I've ever heard in my life.  It's just how rappers brag about fucking chicks.  This guy brags about fucking dudes.  It's phenomenal.  But it's good.  He's like a good rapper.  It's fucking awesome.  He wants it.  Twisted Life, Closet, Eminem, and The Fag.  Yeah, it's like...  He goes, run from the faggots, run from the faggots.  I guess you're picking one fucking fag to fuck with.  It's all about gay bashing.  And him and his boys go after some guy for gay bashing. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  Dude, it's awesome.  You're a little too excited.  It's hysterical.  We'll check it out on Monday.  Dude, it's hysterical.  Joe Rogan digging on gangsta fag.  You're going to cry when you do it.  Seriously.  Check it out.  It's very funny.  Look who's here.  Jon Favreau.  What's up, Jon?  Hey, look what you stepped into.  I don't think Jon wants to sit down with us anymore.  This must be satellite.  Yes, yes.  Satellite radio.  It is indeed satellite radio.  So these are the guys that you would wear on your shirt all the time on Colin's show,  right?  Yes, these are the two guys.  How much did you pay him for all those plugs? 
[01:44:00]  He's on the show now, so he gets paid.  He's full-time now.  That was his golden parachute?  It's kind of incestuous.  The more these guys get bigger, the more my shitty gays get plugged.  It all kind of worked out.  So it was a financial gain for me to do.  Let me just say, I loved that show.  The first two acts every night, I would TiVo that thing.  I'd watch Colin's show all the time.  I really, really liked it.  Sorry to see it go.  Yeah.  All kidding aside.  You were always very, very funny.  Oh, thank you.  Colin was very good.  Did you see Colin play poker?  He played in that celebrity poker.  No, did he?  He actually played some of the worst poker I've ever seen in my life and won. 
[01:44:30]  And won for the night.  Well, that's it.  That's a good part about poker.  He was calling everything, and he was playing with like 5-3.  You know, 5-3.  He didn't care, and he's raised, and he wound up winning the whole thing.  His ignorance was his greatest strength.  It certainly was.  Yeah, they were making fun of him.  We had the audio.  They were making fun of him.  They were just trashing him.  I know.  How do you like that, though?  See, that's the thing.  I'm at the point where I know enough to get me in trouble.  Really?  Where they can put me on a hand.  I've seen you play a few times.  I know enough that the pros could just tear me to shreds. 
[01:45:00]  What do you think of your chances out there?  Oh, horrible.  Really?  I just don't want to make a mistake, honestly.  I like it so much, though.  It's so much fun.  It's a lot of fun.  This is the best one of them all, too.  Yeah.  Half the table is fish, and half the table are, you know, sharks.  Right, right.  So you get to watch.  So it's like a strip club.  It's like a bunch of dudes.  Watch is like prey and predators.  Who's the guy that's going to buy the check of the champagne?  Do you find in this setting that because... 
[01:45:30]  And I'm a blonde in a miniskirt.  I don't play much poker, but I've heard that in this setting, my friend said that the dynamics  are so different just because of everything.  It's true.  Oh, we don't laugh.  I'm trying to do it.  I know what you mean.  I know the essence of what you're asking.  He's my favorite.  This one's not so bad, but I lucked into a seat at the finals at the Bellagio for like  a 25 grand buy-in with all the big boys, and I swear it was like the first day in jail.  Really?  You just didn't want to make any eye contact. 
[01:46:00]  You didn't want to drop the soap.  You just wanted to mind your own business, and you know...  How'd you do?  I slipped in the shower.  I did good until I did the cardinal sin.  I folded and showed my hand.  Why would you do that?  Because I wanted to show them I was folding a strong hand that I was playing tight to  set them up.  Any information you give them, it goes right in the back computer, and right after that,  they all came after me.  All came after me.  But I hung in there for a full day.  You did?  Yeah.  With all the big boys, with like T.J.  Cloutier and Ron Rose and Dewey Tomko, these big guys, and it was really great to be there 
[01:46:30]  and watch them play and see how they did it.  But it's literally like playing with both of your cards facing up.  Right, right.  They just know.  Look right through you.  But I'm such a fan.  It's like, you know, would you play in Wimbledon against, you know, Agassi?  Sure you would.  Exactly, yeah.  Anyone but Arthur Ashe.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy?  So what's the name of your name?  We'll play with no high five at the end.  What a despicable human being you are, man. 
[01:47:00]  Was that question just a long setup for that joke?  Everything in life is a long setup for that joke.  Let me run with the line.  Let us come back.  Like a sailfish.  You know, we should take a quick break because we don't know what's going on out there.  We've got to get Anthony to his table.  Oh, really?  John, what table are you at?  What table are you at?  Seven.  Seven?  Seat seven tables.  You're going to be playing with...  Baywatch girl.  No, I think Deacon Jones.  Oh, Deacon Jones?  Deacon Jones.  Oh, Deacon Jones?  Yeah.  Was Deacon Jones lucky seven, I think?  I think he was.  He's very intimidating.  Yeah, he's a scary cat. 
[01:47:30]  He says he's good.  Does he spit on the cards or was that Nitschke?  Nitschke spit on the ball.  I don't know.  Wasn't it Butkus?  Butkus, that's right.  That was spit on the ball?  That was spit on the ball.  I'm not sure.  All right.  Just keep bringing up his odd couple appearance back at Deacon Jones.  Remember that one when he was an odd couple making the commercial with Oscar Madison  about the shaving cream?  That's right.  I remember.  That was a good one.  You just dated yourself.  I certainly did.  Who doesn't remember watching the odd couple?  Like it's never been rerun.  Yeah, I saw it first run.  It's like...  Yeah.  That was it. 
[01:48:00]  I want to remember your show of shows.  It was fantastic.  We're going to step aside.  Rogan's going to help us out with the rest of the show because Anthony's going to be  playing poker.  I don't know if you're starting at two or not.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be two.  We'll see.  Huh?  I got to say good luck to Anthony.  That's right.  I got to go?  Good luck, Anthony.  Five minutes.  Good luck, Anthony.  Thank you.  I hope it won't be like that Ernie Kovacs.  Yeah, I know.  I'll be right back.  Good luck, Anthony.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from Los Angeles.  A quick break.  It will continue.  Joe Rogan is here.  Also, we'll say hi to Rich Vosnick.  Stay there.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:48:30]  What did you say?  Ladies and gentlemen, sit down and put on your laughing hats because here comes a home run.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, now.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  It's psychotic.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yay.  Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202. 
[01:49:00]  He can destroy.  He can destroy.  And we're back with the Opie program because it's all about me.  Live from Los Angeles. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, we're broadcasting from the World Poker Tour.  Anthony has left the broadcast center.  Oh, no.  Ant.  Ant, jump on for a second.  Oh, no.  Look.  Wow.  Look at Anthony.  Anthony getting the special treatment.  They're ready to escort him.  They're ready to escort him.  Just say something real fast.  Any final thoughts, Anthony?  I'm going to try my best.  Wait, wait.  Now the mic's on.  Go ahead.  I'm going to try my best and hope I do well.  Make the people back home proud.  You're just peeing next to Ed Asner.  I was.  Really?  I went, Lou, nice hog, Lou. 
[01:50:00]  Lou, that's a beautiful hog, Lou.  Yeah, I was peeing next to Ed Asner.  That's great.  There he is.  That doesn't happen every day, huh?  I've got to go to my table, though.  Yeah, Club City Kenny's right there.  And you've got Vince Van Patten showing up over here.  I see Vince.  There he is.  Right next to you.  Hey, Vince.  Vince, you can take this microphone.  I'm going to go play.  This is a good meeting.  Good to meet you.  Good to see you.  Yeah, this is a cluster F of a radio program.  Joe Rogan from Fear Factor.  How are you, man? 
[01:50:30]  How you doing?  Opie, how are you, buddy?  Kenny's escorting Anthony to Table 14.  You think Anthony's going to do well, Joe?  I have no idea.  I know nothing about cards.  Yeah, I'm with you.  So maybe we could get something from Vince here.  Because I would be out first, no problem.  I don't have the personality for cards.  Yeah, I don't get it.  It's just a little piece of paper with numbers on it.  I don't care.  Vince is like, oh, wow, that's great.  We'll use that on the TV show.  No, I would have to know what the other guy is.  Are you going to play, Joe?  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:51:00]  Just lift the mic up just a little bit.  Oh, are we on?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  This is what we do.  What are you guys doing?  A radio show?  Yeah, we just, this is what we do.  We just goof on each other and talk about how hot half these girls are that are walking  around.  It's very hot.  And that's about it.  That's right.  It's going to be great.  No, poker, you have to be very patient.  You've got to wait for cards.  But you've got to be, you have to have a peripheral.  You have to be able to see at the table everyone what they're doing without them seeing you  doing that.  That's why a lot of guys wear glasses.  So that's the big part of the game. 
[01:51:30]  It's winning, like psychological warfare.  It is.  And you know what?  It is truly playing players and not your cards.  I don't care what I get.  I want to understand what you have.  Because if I don't think you have anything, I'm going to win that pot.  I'm going to take pots that aren't mine.  That's the essence of poker, good poker.  See, that's the problem.  I would just keep...  You've got no patience.  Yeah, no patience.  And I don't want that guy to get the upper hand on me.  So even if I have a bad hand and he keeps raising the pot, I'm in every time.  Because I can't let someone do that to me.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of a sucker play. 
[01:52:00]  You want action.  Oh, I know it is.  Players want to play and they get excited.  I'm broadcasting Anthony's out there because he has the patience for this.  And he understands the game a little bit more.  Nice.  I don't know.  Jim Norton has joined the broadcast.  Hi, I'm Vince Van Fatton.  Nice to meet you.  Good to see you.  And a big celebrity here, Rich Voss.  Hi, how are you doing?  Hey, it's Vince.  How's it going?  Great.  What's up, Rich?  Well, we just took a picture for him with James Wood.  Oh, really?  Oh.  And then when I went to get one, James Wood ran like somebody yelled, fire.  Probably because you don't know his name is James Woods.  Whatever. 
[01:52:30]  I...  All right, Woods, Woods.  Did you see Tiger Wood outside too?  You're breathing really heavy.  Did you run back to the table or something?  Yeah, we had to squeeze through the door.  Yeah.  Tight squeeze.  I don't know how he made it.  Back off the mic a little bit.  You're driving people nuts.  We had to squeeze through the door.  Are you trying to say he's fat?  No, I wouldn't say.  He looks good, doesn't he?  Thanks.  You know, for the last half an hour, I've been going over in my head how I could have got  Deacon Jones.  But if I only had the ad-lib skills on the mic when I had the chance... 
[01:53:00]  You had him with Lou Rawls.  I had him with Lou Rawls, but no money.  He trounced all of us.  Don't feel bad.  He trounced him.  He smashed all of us.  He's very funny.  And I set you up good.  Yeah.  Deacon Jones, you know, the NFL, well, the Hall of Famer there, the linebacker, he found  out that Rich is writing for Chris Rock for the Oscars, and Deacon goes, Chris Rock?  I don't like Chris Rock, blah, blah, blah.  So I go, well, you know that bit about, you know, the blacks?  And I told Deacon that Rich wrote that bit, and Deacon was ready to just kill you.  I know.  I saw your heart go up to your throat. 
[01:53:30]  I was nervous because I don't want people to think that I wrote that bit.  That's a classic bit of his.  You can't go, you know, whatever.  No, but I was going with the racist angle, because it looks like he didn't like that bit  because it makes fun of, you know, quote his people.  You don't want people to think you wrote that great bit, but you're happy to let them know  you wrote your act?  You had to open your eyes and prepare for that.  Don't turn to the phone.  Well, you know, I'm the host of this whole thing. 
[01:54:00]  I'm the World Poker Tour.  And you're playing, too, right?  I'll be playing today, but usually I don't get to play.  But also, I think I was supposed to talk about the boot camp that we're doing,  the World Poker Tour boot camp coming out next month that I'll be doing.  I'll be the, you know, sort of the drill captain of the boot camp, WPT boot camp,  which will make players supposedly great poker players.  That's what we're doing.  That's what I'm doing today.  I'm going to be playing in the event as well.  But how do you make someone a great poker player?  You either have it or don't, right?  Well, you can.  The acting skills and the gimmick. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Do you teach gimmicks?  Yeah, you do.  There's so many elements to becoming a very good poker player.  You can't learn it in two days, but we're going to try to teach people as much as we can.  Okay.  And this event's going to be great.  Celebrities going against the best poker pros in the world.  Celebrities for the first time, unlike golf, you know, celebrity events and tennis events,  where they don't get that very, they don't get excited.  They truly get excited playing with the best players in the world.  Let me ask you, I don't really play poker, but do you think that this, 
[01:55:00]  my friend was telling me that this whole thing here is very different,  because he's like, man, just the attitudes and this, like the whole vibe here.  Well, you know, I think the poker pros want to win it.  I mean, there's real money going at stake here.  I think it's $150,000, $250,000 to win it.  So the pros want to win this.  They're hungry.  And the celebrities would love to win it and put it to the charities. 
[01:55:30]  There's a charity they're playing for, right?  When they were trying to get celebrities, do you think,  picking the week of the Oscars was a bad week, you know?  No, you know, all the celebrities, they love to play it.  I think we've got a great bunch out there, you know?  I saw the lady from the practice.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, Cameron Manheim.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, she's out there?  Oh, wow.  We've got to let you go.  Don't you have to get to your table?  I'll get out there.  Nice to see you guys.  When you get knocked out, come on back and say hi to us.  Wait, I want to get a picture with you.  Nice to meet you, man.  Well, get your picture now.  Sorry, buddy.  Ben, head to Ben. 
[01:56:00]  That's the most uncomfortable thing ever.  So much kills me.  What's up, Rich?  Nothing.  Just walking around here.  Oh, I see Anthony.  Anthony is already freaked out.  I can tell.  What's your big deal?  Hi, Anthony!  Anthony!  That's all embarrassing.  Look, hi!  Here's retard friends yelling from the car.  Yeah, we're about 30 feet away.  Good luck on the date.  Luke Ossett Jr. is making him do leg lifts on a roof, and we're mooning him as the boat 
[01:56:30]  goes by.  Anthony just gave the universal sign of done.  He just did that.  What's your big deal?  Across the neck.  He recognized one of the pros is right there, right?  Pro?  Pro right there?  He's nervous, doesn't he?  Yeah.  He's losing his mind.  He's playing poker.  How could you be nervous?  I don't get it.  Because he's playing against pros, and he's being...  What's the big deal?  You get cards dealt to you.  If they're good, you win.  He's pointing to that guy that has his back turned to us, going, I'm so done. 
[01:57:00]  So, obviously, he's been thrown on a table that has a real pro, so...  I think Anthony will be back in the broadcast in 10 minutes.  They're about to begin.  Kenny, what's up?  Club Soda Kenny.  Anthony's sitting with a poker pro called Men the Master.  Yeah, back down a little bit.  Men the Master?  What is his name?  He's sitting with a pro called Men the Master.  That's the club Norton was in the other night.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Now, Club Soda Kenny has escorted Anthony to the table. 
[01:57:30]  What was the vibe?  Is he feeling it?  He's getting nervous?  I tried to psych him up a little bit.  Oh, wait.  Ben wants in.  Men the Master?  Men the Master.  He's like, I'm dead.  He's the best.  He's sitting right across from Anthony, too.  The guy in the black leather jacket?  Yeah, there he is.  Men the Master.  Oh, my God.  One of the Asian pros is at his table.  Oh, great.  You'll never read it.  I don't know how you can play blank stare.  You can't tell if he's happy or crying.  How can you play poker without smoking a cigarette?  If you're a smoker, that's half the game. 
[01:58:00]  You don't let them smoke in here?  No.  How do you play?  It's so weak.  One of the guys we had on the program said that's the difference between playing online  and, you know, in one of these atmospheres.  You can't smoke during these tournaments, and some of these people freak out because  they need a cigarette.  Do most of these guys spend their time playing online?  This guy who's supposed to sit down with Anthony, he's so good, he's not even sitting yet.  What would it be?  He's talking to his friend, the Asian guy?  Yeah.  So most of these guys, they play online?  Is that how they get their action in?  They practice online?  You guys probably play in Vegas, I'm guessing. 
[01:58:30]  Most of the pros, right?  You can make a lot of money online, apparently, right?  You can put up your credit card, and it's illegal gambling.  Yeah, Anthony plays online a little bit here and there, but the real players don't play online.  No, they don't?  No, they're too busy, like, going all over the world to enter these tournaments.  I wouldn't trust online, though, because you never know if the computer is just generating  and beating everybody.  I wouldn't trust that.  I like to play with people.  Can it do that?  I'm sure it could.  Online, if you're playing just like a slot machine.  You know, slot machines are not accurate.  Yeah, but those things are...  So I guess, like, the server would have to be rigged. 
[01:59:00]  Somebody in the middle would have to rig it, and they would decide who would...  Sure.  I've got to break in here, because, you know, I've known Anthony for 10 years.  He is out of his mind nervous right now.  He's, like, doing this with his hands and what?  Oh, look at him.  Just say it, Ben.  The other people that are at Anthony's table.  We found Anthony's gimmick, by the way.  Just shake like a girl.  He's finished.  Cameron Mannheim from The Practice is at Anthony's table.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, cool.  And some guy...  The one that looks like Lithgow from Garp.  And Eric Palladino?  Which one is Eric Palladino? 
[01:59:30]  Green.  He's wearing the green.  Oh, from ER, right?  He's got...  It looks like he's listening to his walk on the nightclub.  I've got a couple celebrities at each table.  Wait, where's...  Where's, like, Gabe Kaplan?  Where's Ed Asner?  Did you hear that Anthony peed right next to Ed Asner in the bathroom?  Oh, he's here?  Yeah.  Where is he?  Anthony's...  I want to ask Anthony if you saw Ed Asner's hog.  He said, yeah, it hung to the left.  All right, well...  Anthony is giving us a look like...  Save my seat, boys.  I'll be back in a few minutes.  That'd be funny to get knocked out. 
[02:00:00]  I know.  Ben, what's going on?  He just...  It's funny looking over there because the min, the master, is just standing there looking  at him.  Are you going to go in and stand around the table if you're not playing?  Yeah, well, Ben's going to be our runner.  He's going to go back and forth.  And look at people's cards and stuff.  Yeah, can you give Anthony a little help there?  Yeah, I don't think we can do that.  All right.  I don't have a clue.  I don't...  You know, it's funny because Anthony watches a lot of the poker on TV.  He knows all the professionals.  I couldn't...  I wouldn't recognize one of the...  Dude, I don't give a fuck about those cards.  Look at that chick.  The chick who's got her shirt hanging over her sleeves to give you the impression that 
[02:00:30]  she's sort of undressing.  She's walking around with her shirt hanging off her elbows just so you could just think  about ripping her fucking dress out and fucking the shit out of her.  That's why she's walking like that.  Dirty little bitch.  She's putting that fucking scent out.  She's the hottest chick in the room and she fucking knows it.  So what does she do?  She takes her shirt halfway off and lets it dangle around her elbows and walks with her  tits gently bouncing around.  Little skirt on, hugging and kissing everybody.  Fuck yeah!  All right.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[02:01:00]  Is that a tranny?  Oh, come on.  Is that a tranny?  Listen, I smell pussy from here.  That's not a tranny.  Yes, Kenny?  You should see the Adam's apple on that thing.  Oh, really?  Oh, well, from the back.  It's not gay if you can't tell from the back.  Yeah, screw this poker thing.  Let's just start pointing out hot chicks.  That chick's fucking hot, dude.  Where'd she go?  I haven't jerked off in two days.  I got a buildup.  I think they have started the games.  Where's Ed Asner?  I don't know.  He's out there.  He's a prostate thing.  Saving an animal out from him.  Comes out slow and it squirts. 
[02:01:30]  All right, I'm trying to read Anthony right now.  Like a dog with a boner.  The cards have been dealt it.  He's already shaking his head.  Did anyone else see him just shake his head?  Yeah.  What does that mean when he gets up and walks away from the table?  Is that a good sign?  He shook his head and then he kind of acknowledged the mean guy.  What's his name?  Min the Master.  What?  Min the Master.  I don't know.  The guy with the glasses he's kind of thrown with.  That's the guy from E.R.  That's the guy with the iPod thing in his ears?  Yeah, and the sunglasses.  He's got a big old beer.  There you go.  I don't know why Anthony doesn't have a beer. 
[02:02:00]  He's taking this a little too seriously, I think.  He does.  He does have a beer?  All right.  Who is Scott Baio at?  Scott Baio is here?  No, I just feel it.  I just feel it.  There's some really good people here tonight.  What do they have?  Is it Mimi Rogers here?  I don't know.  Mimi Rogers.  Mimi.  Mimi.  Mimi Rogers.  Yeah, I guess so.  Mac Culkin.  Macaulay Culkin.  I'm glad you could ask him at Michael Jackson.  He ain't coming over here, right, Ben?  Huh?  Where is he?  I can't even see him.  Are we going to get more of these celebrities after they get him?  How old is Macaulay Culkin now? 
[02:02:30]  Like 15, I think.  Why wouldn't he be on?  Can we get some of these guys over after they get knocked out?  Yeah, as soon as people get knocked out, they're coming our way.  How do you know they're coming our way?  That's the plan, anyway.  Do they have to put their own money up for this?  No.  I don't know.  Oh, it's charity.  Yeah, we didn't have to.  I think XM threw in the $25,000 entry fee.  Sure.  I was talking to Joe, you know, while we were in break.  He has a flotation tank, and I want to get one of these from my apartment.  What's it do?  Have you ever floated before?  No.  You would try it.  No.  You wouldn't try the float? 
[02:03:00]  It's a sensory deprivation tank.  It's claustrophobic, though.  It's a gigantic tank of water that has, it's got like 800 pounds of salt in it, and so you float,  and the temperature of the water is the same temperature as the skin.  It's 93.5 degrees, and it's total silence, total darkness, and you float in there, and all the senses are gone.  You don't see anything, feel anything, touch a thing, no sense of distance, and your mind starts just going into crazy places.  It's the wildest experience you'll ever have in your life.  It's like a psychedelic experience without taking any drugs.  How long do you have to stay in there for?  As long as you want.  You know, I go in there for a couple hours at a time. 
[02:03:30]  Is it for relaxation?  It's for everything.  Relaxation, it gives you a much more objective look at life than I think you ever possibly can have just walking around.  And your mind is always dealing with shit.  You're always dealing with noise and people talking to you and what everyone needs and sounds and touch,  and when you're in that tank, all that shit's gone.  Your mind is like on hyperspeed because your mind doesn't have to deal with any sensory input,  so it's just it opens up like you can think so much clearer.  It's phenomenal.  It's the most phenomenal physical experience you can have. 
[02:04:00]  It's like floating through the universe.  Yeah, you just float.  I did it once when I was working in Rochester.  It's amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  The first time, you don't get the hang of it.  You've got to do it a bunch of times to relax and get comfortable.  You get freaked out.  Yeah.  You're so freaked out because it's completely dark,  and after a while, you really feel like you're just floating in space.  Well, not only that, you have to learn how to manage your mind because your mind starts doing busy work.  You'll start going, God damn, I've got a fucking itch on my nose,  but you don't have an itch on your nose.  It's just your mind can't believe you're not doing anything,  so your mind wants you to start doing shit.  So you're like, fuck, I want to itch my balls. 
[02:04:30]  But if you itch yourself and you're totally naked, the water is very salty.  So any place you touch is not a good idea because you'll start feeling that it's itchy and salty,  so you've got to just chill.  So it takes a few times to get used to just chilling.  You don't start freaking from it, do you?  You don't start like all weirding out?  No.  I go in there really fucking high.  I smoke like four or five hits of like sick chronic and get in there.  It's the wildest experience ever.  It's literally like you cease to exist. 
[02:05:00]  Is that wild?  Yeah.  You just feel that way every day.  Would you do that or what?  I don't know.  I don't like Rich's hurtful comment.  What did you say?  I don't know.  He just ceased to exist every day.  Rich is implying that I kind of live in one of those soul-filled things  with my fat tits just bobbing around in cyberspace somewhere.  Meaning nothing to anybody.  I mean, that's kind of what he was saying, I think.  Can you pump in some music, too?  You can if you want.  I don't.  A little Dark Side of the Moon or something?  It has speakers installed in it.  You know, they're underneath the water.  I would imagine you'd have to pick the right music, though.  Yeah, you know what?  You don't want to do that. 
[02:05:30]  You don't want to have any input, man.  You just want to just do it.  We could do it together, can't we?  Yeah, just two men sitting in there getting salty.  What's going on at Club Soda County?  Another pro just sat down at Anthony's table.  The female, Annie Duke in that pink shirt with the gray sleeves.  Oh, cool.  She won, like, the high-low game of the poker thing.  So getting beat by a chick in poker is a lot like getting beat by a chick in pool.  You don't really want that to happen, right?  I just saw Jennifer Kelly just walked in, Brad Garrett, Ray Romano.  Romano?  Yeah, Ray Romano. 
[02:06:00]  Who's that?  I don't know.  He's on that show.  What show?  I don't know.  Everybody loves Romano.  All right.  Have they started dealing the cards?  Yeah, they're playing.  Anthony's being very conservative from what I could see.  What is he doing?  Is he doing anything?  He's got to know when to hold them.  Know when to fold them.  No, dude.  Hey, jump the mic and walk away.  He knows that's awful.  Will we get any celebrities over here?  I know when to punch out.  And slam the mic down. 
[02:06:30]  I want some pictures.  Huh?  We'll get the pictures later after the radio show.  He's the biggest celebrity here.  I want Ed Asner, dude.  He goes to Mary Tyler Moore.  That's all you care about?  Dude, I'm so worthless when there's celebrities around.  I just get pictures.  You know what?  We haven't talked about it.  You were supposed to direct a porno last night.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A scene.  There was a golden shower scene I was going to direct.  Really?  Yeah, the chick didn't show up because she has to get up this morning.  She's a day job, which is nice.  Phenomenal.  That guy?  You sell your life to pornography, but you're responsible enough to wake up on time for work.  So she couldn't do the shoot? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  How much sleep does she need?  Well, she does some kind of a day job.  She was going to do a pussy pump, which is that thing they rack around their vagina,  and they pump it up, and they leave it, and it looks like it's really swollen.  Have you seen this thing yet?  We're at the Porn Awards in Vegas.  It's disgusting.  It makes the vag just really overly puffy.  Not in a good way.  It's the whole area.  I can't even explain.  It sucks it out.  Yeah, it's a suction cup.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's suction everything outward, kind of, and it just explodes like an exploding onion,  basically.  You get it to teach you about that.  Yeah.  Huh? 
[02:07:30]  Where's the fun in that?  I don't know.  It looks like Schwarzenegger's face.  Remember when his mask came off in Total Recall for a second and his face started to  blow up?  That's exactly what it looks like.  They're running out of things.  What it is, Joe, is they're running out of things to do in porno.  So it's like, all right, well, let's put a pump on a vag.  Let's see what that does.  And then they take pictures of the girl with their vages puffed up.  I don't get it myself.  Have you ever seen those guys online that shoot saline into their nuts?  You ever seen that?  No.  They fill their nuts up with saline.  They pump their balls up with saline.  Yeah, they tie their balls off at the end. 
[02:08:00]  I'm not bullshitting.  And then they fucking stick a needle in it and they pump their nuts up with salt water.  So if your friend's contact is dry, you jerk off in his eye?  As long as it's through a filter.  You know, there's a lot of people online that do extreme body morphing.  There's a site called, I think it's bme.org, and it's all about extreme, or it might be  bme.com, but it's all extreme body modifications, like guys who split their cock down the middle.  I've seen that one. 
[02:08:30]  Pat through the inside and put all these weird studs in it.  Oh, awful.  I saw one recently where a guy cut his dick off, cut the head of his cock off.  He did it with a rubber band.  He tied it down with a rubber band, and he slices, and he did pictures of every step  of the way.  I've seen that.  I've seen it.  He cut his finger off, too.  The guy missing a finger.  It's a sickness.  One guy cut his fucking hand off.  He built a guillotine.  He built a custom-made home guillotine.  He cut his own fucking hand off.  No.  Yes.  He's got photos of it online.  He's got photos of the guillotine.  Where's his website?  I don't know what his website is, but I actually wrote something about it on my website. 
[02:09:00]  It was like three or four years ago I read about it.  I know where you can see those pictures.  If you go to eatabullet.com, there's a whole bunch of them up.  Just check on the calendar, so you'll know where the...  Isn't there information being given out at the Houston Improv?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to talk about that, though.  This weekend, if you're down there, just come to the show.  If not, it's all right.  He's flying out tomorrow.  Yes, Club Sutter County, back at the table here.  No, I just heard you speaking about cutting dicks off.  Yeah, yeah.  He had to jump in.  You got a story?  Do you know why Jewish women like their men circumcised?  Why?  They like one-third off.  Oh. 
[02:09:30]  I just want to say, what a great comedy show this would be with Rich Foss, Jim Norton,  and Mr. Joe Rogan.  I saw Joe.  I told him on the air at the Comedy Store.  I absolutely loved his act, man.  Absolutely.  Are you going to be doing the Comedy Store in the next couple of days?  No, this weekend I'm at the Irvine Improv.  Okay.  Improv in Irvine.  So if anyone's in Orange County, hit on down there.  Anthony's still in the game.  Not for a while.  I don't know.  Anthony's still hanging in there.  Well, he probably just anteed and folded.  He's doing well. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, he really is.  He'll get in the hang of it, though.  I see people playing games like this, and I totally get how I could get sucked into it.  I used to play Quake, Quake 3, you know, the video game.  I used to play online literally eight to ten hours a day.  Dude, I was obsessed.  I could gamble, and I would love to do this stuff.  I mean, how hard could it be?  I used to play pool before that.  I used to be obsessed with that when I lived in New York.  You know, my gaming got very, very involved, and recently I took a drastic step backwards.  I'm playing solitaire on my trio.  I won't play anything on my phone. 
[02:10:30]  That's why I drive online.  It's on my trio when I fly and stuff, and I have to play until I finally beat the game.  It's like a whole OCD thing that happens, and it's not even about having fun anymore.  It's like just keep playing, keep playing until I finally beat the game, and then I can finally put my trio down.  Yeah, I've given up on games pretty much.  I used to play chess on my Palm Pilot on planes.  Me too.  Did you hear my chess story?  It gets obsessive, though.  My chess story, I used to play chess growing up and stuff, and recently I started playing online through AOL or something,  and I started kicking ass, having a lot of fun, feeling like I still have the skills, right? 
[02:11:00]  And then I'm playing this guy, and all of a sudden he goes, how old are you?  And I'm like, well, how old are you?  And the person writes, I'm eight.  I swear to God.  I felt like such a creep.  I'm like, well, I'm 17.  I couldn't even fess up to my age, and then I finished that game, and I haven't played since.  I'm like, you didn't write that.  What are you wearing?  Yeah, right.  I really thought I was playing against, like, you know, 30-year-old.  Is your mommy home? 
[02:11:30]  Are you a big boy?  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  Yeah, I was so innocent, but then all of a sudden you start feeling like a pedophile and crap.  I thought I was playing against, like, guys in their 30s.  I'm playing against an eight-year-old feeling good about myself because I'm smashing them.  I did that bit on stage about checkers about six months ago, so.  What is it?  About me playing online.  I beat the kid.  I go, do you want to play again?  He goes, I can't.  The babysitter said lights out.  So it's basically the same story, but I had a bit.  Well, you do listen to the radio show religiously, so I'm thinking you might have ripped me off.  No, I did it before you guys got back on the air. 
[02:12:00]  I noticed you were playing checkers.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I can't play chefs.  I don't know the game.  So getting back to you, are you directing the thing tonight?  If she shows up, we're going to have to make it a little earlier.  It's in L.A.?  Yeah, well, they're going to do it in the hotel room.  Who's producing it?  Kick-Ass Productions.  Kick-Ass Productions.  Yeah.  I know so many 4-0 stars now.  I was on the way over here.  I was talking to Stephen St. Croix.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's for sure.  He's a great guy.  And he did a show called, two videos called Rear Factor, where he plays me. 
[02:12:30]  It's fucking phenomenal.  And I was talking to him on the phone, and then I'm realizing, I talk to Ron Jeremy all  the time.  I know Jenna James.  And I'm like, how weird is this?  You know, how strange is it that you know all these fucking porn stars?  Did it trip you out?  I pulled a train with Ron.  It was me and him and a girl, and Dennis Hop took pictures.  Dennis Hop took pictures and showed it to me.  Oh, you saw the pictures?  Yeah, he's bringing it around to everybody.  I'm like, yeah, keep me away from your whores, you fucking big mouth.  Oh, I don't mind, too.  I know you don't mind.  She's great in those, too.  It's such a deceptive angle.  She's like holding it like it's the fattest cock she's ever seen. 
[02:13:00]  Well, good work, Hubble.  Hubble!  And yeah, Ben's back at the table.  That's funny, man.  Good work, Hubble!  Go ahead, Ben.  Anthony said he's folding a lot.  He's just folding a lot?  Yeah.  Are you talking to him?  Are you able to go right up to him?  Yeah, I can go right up to him.  So what's going on at that table?  Any action at all?  I see they've got a camera guy there kind of filming the table as we speak.  Yeah, they're just playing away.  How are you going to get people over here after they lose it?  They're going to go that way, right? 
[02:13:30]  Nah, we'll figure it out.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Look, I'm just saying, Jennifer Tilly.  How many hands has he played?  I don't know that.  I don't know that.  The one girl.  The bad-looking girl.  Dude, this is the most hot chicks that have ever been in commerce ever.  In this place, yeah.  In one point and one time.  Yeah, this casino is a little strange.  Well, Joe said that.  You know, we're very happy to be at this casino.  No, not the casino.  So, Joe, just commerce in general.  You could talk for all of us if you like.  We were kind of scared about the ride over here.  It's top shelf.  We're in this van. 
[02:14:00]  It's like going on a fucking bamboo boat through NAMM.  Just trying to make your way through the fucking casino.  I'm like, where the hell?  There's a lot of hungry-looking dudes out there, too.  I've been to L.A., I don't know, about a dozen times.  I'm like, I've never seen this part out of here.  Yeah.  And then, also, we got lost.  Club Sotomayor is driving the bus, and we pull off the highway, and next thing you know,  everything is now in Spanish, and he decides he's going to jump out and ask for directions.  I'm like, good luck.  Yeah, when do we ride into an Edward James Alamos film? 
[02:14:30]  It's like 70% of it looks like Vietnamese and Cambodian.  I don't know how they even call these casinos.  There's no crap tables or slot machines.  It's so weird.  It's one of those weird gray areas.  Like, you can't have whorehouses, but you can have strip clubs that give you naked lap dances,  and girls rub their dicks with their ass.  It's like, okay, you're saving the world.  Why is this allowed to happen, this casino?  It doesn't make any sense.  I don't know.  There's shit you can't do.  You can't have slot machines.  You can't have certain things.  It's like it's not totally a casino.  It's just poker, and I think, what, is there a blackjack here, too? 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  They have weird games like Pi Gow and shit.  Oh, yeah.  I just want to keep waving at him like a fag and embarrassing him in front of his new poker friends.  It's actually quite boring to watch.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cards.  No, I understand, but there's no real action going on.  No one's really talking with each other.  I want to see a punch speed in front of him.  That would be nice.  Or James Woods hit somebody with his cock.  He has a big one.  A legendarily huge.  He has a rumor.  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  That was the showstopper right there.  Big cock? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, big.  Hello, my name is Elaine, and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles.  Do you know the difference between hookers and actresses?  Okay, you want to fill me in?  Hookers get paid more.  That's what the bottom line is.  It's a bunch of geeks and a bunch of porn stars in the same place at the same time.  Hot young men pointing at each other.  Getting educated every minute.  By someone making grilled cheese with an iron, stupid criminal.  Holy crap.  Say goodbye to your T-shows, everyone. 
[02:16:00]  Live from Los Angeles.  Just pummel them with nightsticks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I have a yelling parent still growing up until they got divorced and it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it.  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone. 
[02:16:30]  And you're sitting there horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out of this.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, and the horrified kids.  Did dad actually leave?  After the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep.  Because the yelling would stop.  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Son of a bitch.  Shut up.  Come in here.  Shut up.  That way.  That's it. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, God.  He's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know?  And then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd hear, like,  And then you'd hear from the kids room.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, 
[02:17:30]  We got, you know, called into the room,  And Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know,  And I want you to know it has nothing to do with you,  We're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long  And really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  That's a fucking asshole.  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much 
[02:18:00]  And didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  No way!  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  From the War of the Koreans.  You've got to be, you're going to just sit there  Disgusted, having to listen to this crap.  Watch them run. 
[02:18:30]  Watch them crawl.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Hold them bait.  Yeah, them spatial, hold them baits.  Watch them lay.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's a dive-in.  All right, are we back? 
[02:19:00]  Had a slight little technical problem there, but it's the OP program today.  I'll take advantage of this.  Now, it's OP and Anthony.  We're live in Los Angeles at the World Poker Tour.  Anthony's at Table 14, playing with a couple pros, a couple celebrities, a couple other fishes, I guess.  I'm starting to learn the terminology here.  I don't really care, to be honest with you.  I'm just making believe I care for the program. 
[02:19:30]  But Club Star to Kenny ran over all excited because there was an all-in at his table.  At Anthony's table, but I got more updating news.  Big talking Deacon Jones is out already.  No.  He's one of the first guys out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to count, and he put all his money in.  I tried to get him over here.  He goes, no, those guys are going to rat on me.  Well, you've got to get him over here.  He was talking smack.  Why doesn't he like Chris Rock?  He's got, like, two cocktails in his hands.  He's, like, talking to blondes.  He ain't coming over here.  Hey, Rich, why don't you shut up while Club Star to Kenny's talking?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Pay attention.  It was the language?  That's what he doesn't like, the language?  I'm sorry.  Mr. Rowe's going to ask me a question.  I'm sorry.  And Club Star to Kenny was talking.  He doesn't like the language.  Does that kill you?  Well, Deacon Jones is pissed off at this guy in the Los Angeles Times  because, basically, he trashed Deacon as being a really bad poker player.  So, Deacon was talking smack, and it turns out he is one of the first guys out today.  Deacon stinks.  He really does.  Denial ain't just a ribbon, Africa.  And we were trying to get him back on the show, but that ain't happening. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, boy, he gets smashed quickly.  And then there was an all-in on Anthony's table.  I don't know what happened.  I don't think Anthony went in on that.  Anthony looks comfortable.  Yeah.  He's starting to relax a little bit.  He knows we're talking about him right now.  He's just kind of nodding his head.  He's got a big, shitty grin.  Look at him.  I wish we had, like, some special, like, signs.  What?  Oh.  Now he's hanging in there, though.  All right.  We got Rich Voss at the Broadcast Center here.  He brought his lovely fiancée, Rich.  Rich.  Yeah.  Rich got engaged. 
[02:21:00]  Barlin.  Rich got engaged.  Well, you laugh.  Look at the beautiful rock on her head.  She's a very attractive lady.  She's beautiful.  Very funny, too.  Very funny.  A great writer.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I'm a lucky man.  All right.  You're a really romantic guy, too, the way you did it.  That was really nice.  Yeah.  I took her to the diner.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell Joe how you did this whole thing?  She flew in from L.A.  Yeah.  She flew in from L.A.  To Jersey.  I knew my friend was Sunday night, right before Valentine's Day.  And I knew my friend was selling a ring from, because his engagement fell apart. 
[02:21:30]  So he saw.  So I went to a, I was at a 12-step meeting, and I saw him there on Sunday night before going  to the airport.  I saw, did you still have the ring?  Because I was planning on getting it anyhow.  Sure.  Right.  So he had it.  So we ran to his house, and I went back to my house and got the cash, you know, because  I keep that kind of money around.  I headline.  And, uh.  Yeah, well, $500.  A lot of people have that around.  So I got the ring, and I picked her up to the airport, took her to the diner, had some,  you know, some turkey burgers or whatever. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Then I checked into a Best Western Hotel, and I, you know.  Busted out the ring.  Yeah, but I already bought her diamond earrings, and I wanted to return those.  I figured, since I got the ring, why should I give her both?  Well, like an idiot, I gave her both.  That is really cool, though, that you didn't go to a store and pick it out.  You just got it from a friend in a 12-step program.  It was probably relapsing.  It needs the money to get high.  It's all right.  So here, let me have the ring you bought for your fiancé.  That's nice.  Very spiritual.  We got it appraised, man.  It's unbelievable.  Really?  Yeah, I'm very happy.  Very happy with the appraisal.  You really are a juice squared.  Do you know that? 
[02:22:30]  I'm telling you.  Yes, I am.  Bought it from a friend, then had it appraised.  I know you.  You murderer.  I just got a note from Ben.  What's going on, Ben?  Anthony continues to fold.  He's just folding every hand, huh?  Yeah.  I can't wait to get the inside scoop on this whole thing from him.  Deacon's just getting hammered.  He's shit-faced.  No, he's talking to blondes.  We can't get Deacon back over here?  Maybe when he finishes his couple drinks, we'll work on him a little bit.  Is he knocked out already?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you listening?  Yeah, but I don't know if it was real.  You know, it could have been somebody else that looked like him. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, no, he didn't.  That's true.  Scatman Brothers might have gotten knocked out.  Who knows the difference?  Yeah.  He didn't go there.  Or Lou Rawls, like you said earlier.  Yeah, he looks like a lot of people, you know.  The best part of Deacon coming over here is Jim's like,  who the hell is this guy?  And he heard Jim say that.  That's half the reason he was attacking.  You're like, who the hell is this guy when he first talked to him?  Something like that.  You didn't recognize Deacon Jones?  No.  I don't.  You know that.  I don't even really know who Deacon Jones is.  I've just been playing along.  Just a big football player.  From the Rams.  A fearsome person.  I don't watch football.  I knew his name because he's a legendary player, 
[02:23:30]  but I would never have known the face.  You can't be bothered with football?  I don't like football.  Why?  I really only watch fighting.  I watch, like, the UFC, ultimate fighting and boxing.  That's the only thing I watch.  You know, I get bored with sports.  To me, the only thing that matters, like, the score and everything,  it doesn't mean anything.  Like, a ball goes into a hole, that doesn't mean anything.  To me, it's like a guy dropping a cell phone.  But if a guy beats a guy's ass, that's exciting.  I'll tell you one thing, you know, I don't know.  I finally found my line because I was into the UFC for a little while,  checking that out.  Oh, man, what they do. 
[02:24:00]  When the guy's just in that position,  they're just using their elbow and the guy's nose and face.  I'm like, I'm done.  I do all the color commentary for the UFC.  You do a great job, by the way.  I bought one of those things.  I didn't even know you did it until I heard it.  You're really like, what an animal, man.  You know everything about it.  It was really interesting to watch.  Thanks, man.  I've done martial arts since I was a little kid.  That's what I used to do before I was a comedian.  I used to teach Taekwondo.  I taught at Boston University.  I used to have my own school.  And I used to kickbox.  But you took other stuff.  I mean, Taekwondo was years ago.  I do jiu-jitsu now.  Yeah, I've been doing jiu-jitsu since 1996.  You ever do ultimate fighting, though?  No. 
[02:24:30]  Fighting is something that, first of all,  even if you win, you're still going to the hospital.  You're getting bashed up.  You're going to get hurt.  Your face is getting smashed.  And you have to be completely, totally committed to doing that.  And I don't want to hurt anybody.  I don't want to do it.  I just like watching it now.  Frank Shamrock, would you be nervous about fighting him?  Hell yeah.  He's a psycho.  Didn't you say one of those celebrities were kind of like bull?  What's that?  One of the karate celebrities were kind of like a fro?  Yeah, but these are guys who fight.  None of these guys are frauds.  These are all the guys that fight in the octagon.  They fight in the UFC. 
[02:25:00]  We're getting an update from Club Soda Kenny.  No, I just spotted Macaulay Culkin.  I'm trying to catch his attention so we can talk to him about Michael Jackson.  Talk to him about anything.  Where is he?  How fascinating would it be to talk to him?  I don't know.  He's over there with a super green hat on.  Ooh, that would be fascinating to talk to him.  So I'm keeping my eye on him.  Does he still look like he did when he was young?  I don't know.  I just saw the back of his head, probably what Michael saw also.  Thanks, Kenny.  Captain Obvious.  He's feeling.  Is Chagall the real deal?  Oh, who knows?  Probably not.  Even if he was, the martial art that he does is Aikido. 
[02:25:30]  Before the Ultimate Fighting Championship came around, there was a lot of confusion as  to what was really effective.  People who did karate, they thought their style was the most effective.  People who did judo thought their style.  Everybody thought what they were practicing was the most effective.  But really, it's little pieces and percentages of all of them mixed together.  And that's what it is now.  It's mixed martial arts.  And when the Ultimate Fighting Championship came along, they said, look, let's find out  what's better.  Let's put everybody in a cage.  And you know, you have a grand prize and the best guy wins it.  And we found out a lot of stuff that people have been practicing for thousands of years 
[02:26:00]  was almost totally fucking useless.  In a real fight situation.  And that's what fighting is.  That's what martial arts is supposed to be about.  It's supposed to be martial.  It's supposed to be about war, about combat with your body.  And there's a huge percentage of it that's just completely fucking useless.  And they didn't figure that out.  So, you know, what, is Seagal good at Aikido?  Yeah.  Is Aikido good as a martial art?  No.  No.  It's a transference of energy martial art.  It's like a guy commits to you and you throw him on the ground.  I mean, basically, the idea was Aikido was invented so that if a guy has a sword and 
[02:26:30]  he loses his sword in combat, he can defend himself against another guy with a sword.  Where the guy commits to you, you use his energy against him.  But that doesn't work against a guy who has had a fight to fucking strangle you.  You know, you use my energy.  I just got to get a hold of you.  All a guy has to do is get a hold of you.  Get a hold of you, control your body, and choke you unconscious.  Aikido is good, I think.  If Kelly LeBrock comes at you too hard, you want to smash your head into a wall.  Or smash your cock into her mouth.  We had Tito on the show.  Tito Ortiz.  Oh, yeah?  And, you know, I...  Yeah, get Steve over here, bro.  Oh, that's when he choked that guy out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's when I choked about that. 
[02:27:00]  I listen to our show a lot.  Well, you know what, dude?  I heard about it from the UFC.  I couldn't listen because I was living in L.A.  Oh, okay.  But I heard about it.  Steve.  Yeah.  You know, Joe does the UFC and all that.  Yeah.  And Tito choked you?  Yeah, like in like 12 seconds, I was out.  Tito's a bad motherfucker.  But I bowed to Steve that he even took him on.  Yeah, I was...  I mean, you grappled with him for real?  I was a good 140 pounds heavier, too.  Oh, 140 pounds heavier.  Steve agrees to let Tito go at it with him.  It was right before a big fight, right?  Yeah, he was in town promoting the fight, and Tito's like, yeah.  And we're like, Tito, seriously, you know, Steve's a bouncer and stuff. 
[02:27:30]  He sort of can handle himself.  Go for it.  Just don't, you know, just don't, you know, kill him.  Right.  Right.  And it was freaking scary how fast he got you out.  He's a brutally strong dude.  Very.  Very strong.  And he's, you know, a professional fighter.  You know, the guy trains five hours a day.  He's legendary for his conditioning.  Within like 10 seconds, he was on my back and had me in a sleeper hold.  And you could feel just the air leaving.  And before I went unconscious, I just tapped, and that was it.  Tough motherfucker.  Really?  And you know what?  He's not even the best. 
[02:28:00]  How crazy is that?  He was for a while, right?  His ass.  Randy Couture just beat him.  Chuck Liddell just knocked him out in the first round.  Or second round, excuse me.  Isn't it being banned?  I mean, it's amazing.  It's amazing.  Is the UFC still being banned in some places?  No.  No.  It's just got passed in California.  And it's legal in Nevada.  Nevada State Athletic Commission.  Legal in Jersey.  Legal in a bunch of places.  But I've been doing it.  I've been doing the commentary or doing Interviewing the Fighters since like 96.  We used to have to go to like Doton, Alabama and weird fucking places because that  was the only place that would allow us to do the shows.  But now there's a TV show on Spike TV called The Ultimate Fighter. 
[02:28:30]  And that thing's getting fucking huge ratings.  It's like two million people a week are watching it, which for Spike is fucking phenomenal.  And so the pay-per-view numbers are growing.  It's a growing sport.  But once you go see it, it's the most fucking exciting thing you'll ever see.  Because it's really, it's human nature broken down to the basic element.  Two men trying to dominate each other.  You know, when a guy slam dunks a ball in a guy's face, you know, ooh, what he's trying  to say is, I just beat your ass.  But the guy at least can walk away and go, yeah, man, this is a fight.  I'll kick your fucking ass.  See, that's what fighting is. 
[02:29:00]  In a fight, there is no, like you can't get your ass kicked and go, yeah, well, I could  fucking slam dunk a basketball on you.  Because nobody cares.  You just get your ass kicked.  It's a definitive ending of all male combat, of all male competition.  Do boxers enter it?  Do boxers go in?  They do, but they get tackled and taken to their back.  You have to know how to grapple.  You have to.  I mean, boxing's very important.  A lot of guys who are fighting in the UFC are actually pro boxers.  And they do really well.  Because they know other things.  It's like, there's a guy named Chris Lytle who's one of the top guys at 170, and he's  a professional boxer as well.  He does both. 
[02:29:30]  But it's a fucking crazy sport, man.  But it's so much fun to watch.  It's so much fun.  I watched a few, and then I couldn't handle it anymore.  I just could not handle it.  I just have a couple of beers.  Yeah, I know.  I shouldn't be such a wimp.  Enjoy it.  It's exciting.  I was pretty much able to watch anything, but that was finally when I said, I'm done.  Look, it's safer than boxing.  Done.  Boxers are much more dangerous.  They take much more shots, and they don't have as many options.  When you're boxing, if you get hit, you're not even allowed to clinch.  You're not even allowed to hang on.  You get penalized for that.  You can get disqualified for that. 
[02:30:00]  But with the UFC, that's what it's all about.  It's like using the best tool for the best situation.  If you get hit with a punch, try to take the guy down.  If the guy's dominating you on the ground, get to your feet.  You know, it's a strategy.  It's chess with your body.  Who's the best guy in the world right now, do you think?  There's no best guy.  There's a bunch of really good guys.  Most of the really good guys, you know, like Tito is a really good guy.  Randy Couture, there's a guy named Vanderlei Silva is probably one of the best pound-for-pound guys.  He's from Brazil.  There's a guy named BJ Penn.  There's a guy from Hawaii who's a bad motherfucker.  He's phenomenal. 
[02:30:30]  There's a bunch of really, really tough guys, and there's not that much money in it.  I mean, the top guys make like a couple hundred thousand dollars for a really big fight.  I mean, for boxing, that's shit.  You can't get Roy Jones to fucking piss in a cup for $200,000, you know, and you're going  to get these guys to train for six weeks, weigh in, take drug tests, you know, all that shit.  I mean, it's the sacrifice they put their body through.  I mean, Tito, that motherfucker goes to Big Bear, and he's up there for six weeks just  running in the mountains at 10,000 elevation, pulling fucking people on bicycles behind him, 
[02:31:00]  you know, and wrestling for fucking hours and hours at a time and punching and kickboxing.  They're just animals.  They're fucking, but you know what, dude?  When they're there, when they're competing, it's the most exciting thing in the world.  When two of the best guys at fighting, when you see two guys that are fighting for the  UFC heavyweight title or the UFC middleweight title, those are the toughest motherfuckers  in the world, period.  There's no one better than them at that level.  See, I'd rather see, to see how tough they are, because they're both so good, it's fairly  even.  I'd rather see one of them just beating up a scrub. 
[02:31:30]  Then you get the real difference.  It's like, see some regular civilian just getting his teeth kicked in.  Well, that's what the old UFCs were.  That's what UFC 1, UFC 2, there was a lot of guys who were fucking karate masters, a lot  of guys who took a lot of bullshit martial arts, and those guys thought they knew what  they were doing.  They got in there with, like, Hoist Gracie, and they just got strangled like a little  bitch, like, instantly, like, toyed with.  We got to break in here.  Club Soto County?  No, I just wanted to say, did anybody notice how ripped Joe Rogan is?  Yeah, he's the worst guy.  I saw his photo layout.  I almost quit comedy and just left the fucking city. 
[02:32:00]  It was embarrassing.  Yeah, no, he's a serious dude, too, a martial artist and everything.  His washboard abs?  Yeah.  It's depressing.  It doesn't make any sense.  You're not supposed to do that if you're a comedian.  It's really a violation of all comedy rules.  It's really stupid.  It goes with your good looks, though.  It's stupid in my part to fucking pose for this.  Now, after I did, I'm like, ooh, this is really not a good movie.  Well, Joe is an odd combination.  He's actually a comedian that has self-esteem and gets laid.  It's a very odd thing to watch, and a good comic.  But when you say, like...  That's the one thing I learned hanging out with you guys, yeah, low self-esteem and just,  yeah, banging hookers whenever you can. 
[02:32:30]  Hold on, Ben is just laughing about something.  So I just talked to Deacon, who's coming back in to me.  He's outside smoking.  All he could talk about is Jim.  He's like, that guy looks like the type of guy that kills families.  He's a sick fuck.  That's all he's talking about.  Give him the stare when he comes back.  Give him the...  He's like, something's really wrong with that guy.  He's like, the little one, the little chubby one that's bald.  And you know, the worst part of that, I don't mind if he thinks I kill families, but did  he have to call me fat?  That's the most hurtful part of that description. 
[02:33:00]  He's coming back.  He's smoking a couple of seers.  The pedophile with the weak chin.  Oh, it was funny.  All he's talking about is you.  And Deacon will be drunk, too, so...  Hey, boss, you still writing for the Oscars, or...?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Dude, I've been watching Chris Rock do that shit at the comedy store.  How funny is it?  Funny, funny, funny shit.  If he does that set at the Oscars, he's going to fucking destroy.  It's so funny.  It's so...  You know, I mean...  The funniest...  Give me one of his lines, man.  Oh, he's doing all...  No, no, no, no, no, never.  Never.  I don't want...  No, no, never.  Give me a little taste, Joe. 
[02:33:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Tune in Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday!  Yeah, but you know what?  Give us one of the jokes that you know he just won't use, because there's no way that  all his material is going to make a...  No, I can't.  I don't want to do that.  You know, it's just really funny shit on Alexander about how he was for gay marriages until he saw  Alexander.  It's fucking...  And I'm not even doing it justice, because I don't remember exactly...  I mean, it's a long bit, but it's fucking phenomenal.  He's got some really funny stuff.  Really funny shit. 
[02:34:00]  It's about time they got somebody with balls to host the event.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This Billy Crystal shit.  Who wants to song and dance?  I always like those...  They're so irrelevant.  But sometimes, you've got to give him credit.  He'll put himself in the movie, and you'll be like, oh, that's Billy in the movie.  And it's really...  It's always funny.  I'll tell you, Steve Martin was funny when he did it.  He did some edgy stuff.  He was great.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Steve Martin was good.  They need someone who's going to do stand-up.  That's how I look at it.  There's a weird thing that happens with comics.  I mean, Steve Martin, at one point in time, was probably one of the funniest guys ever.  But then, you know, a lot of them just kind of drift off into a bad spot. 
[02:34:30]  Club Setter County?  Eric Palladino.  He's a doctor on the OR.  He was on Anthony's table.  He just got knocked out.  Wait, Anthony beat him, sort of?  Cameron Manor.  Oh, and her show's canceled.  Couldn't get her off Ace Jack.  Couldn't get her off Ace Jack.  Were you the dude that was playing with the shades on, drinking the beer with the iPod on?  Yeah, that was me.  Dude, what were you listening to?  I was listening to it.  Which point?  I was probably listening to Foo Fighters.  Oh, okay.  No, right at the beginning, you were cranking something out of your iPod.  Oh, no, I was listening to, um, oh, fuck. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, shit.  You're last week.  It's satellite radio.  Oh, fuck this shit.  Fucking motherfucker.  Let him fly, man.  Let him fly.  So, yeah, the guy I do the radio show with was to your right there.  He's still hanging in there.  With the black hat?  Oh, yeah.  He's a prick.  He's a prick.  He's just a prick.  You are a prick.  He just gave Anthony the finger.  Anthony's, I hear his strategy.  He's just folding a lot at that table, right?  Yeah, he's folding a lot.  He's not really doing much?  I was playing tight up until I ran into the Cameron Manhunt. 
[02:35:30]  Wow, Cameron Manhunt can play poker, huh?  She took you down, huh?  I don't know.  That's debatable.  I think the pros...  She got lucky?  Well, no, she had a jacked-out pair, but there was a straight out there, one card off the straight.  The problem is, you can't bluff out a celebrity.  So, are you like a serious player?  I just won my first tournament Monday night at Hustler.  Wow.  The Hustler tournament.  So, you know who that master guy is?  You know who that guy is?  He's a famous guy?  Yeah, he's pretty good.  I took out Phil Helmuth last night at a tournament.  Is he a big guy? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, really?  We don't know anything about cards.  We're just sitting here, just goofing off.  Just hanging out.  Yeah, we don't know anything.  $25,000, isn't that kind of a lot to go that quick?  $25,000, what would he bet in?  $5,000, $10,000?  Yeah, was it your $25,000?  No, it was $10,000 you start out with.  Oh, I took $25,000.  You start out with, yeah.  $10,000.  Yeah, and then I was up to like $12,000, and unfortunately, I played a little too aggressive.  Too aggressive.  So you've played in tournaments before.  I've never played in a tournament, but a friend of mine plays a lot of poker.  From the beginning.  And he was saying that a lot of times aggression in a certain situation is just something that 
[02:36:30]  like, eh.  It works.  Put it this way.  If I played that way, right, if I played the hand against a pro, they would have folded.  Because it was, oh, I see.  The camera has a jack.  I'm sticking with a jack.  So you played too good.  That's what I think.  I like the way you put it.  Yes.  I will say yes.  You played the right way, and she played the wrong way, and she got lucky.  I don't think she's going to win.  Do you think that the camera...  But I'm bitter right now, and I'm angry, so I wouldn't trust anything I say. 
[02:37:00]  Do you think that the camera and the lights just contribute to what's like the whole thing?  I think if you're looking at it as far as lights go, yes.  It would be awesome that people answer him.  Do you think that fan should have won season one?  Who?  This actor character doesn't have the light.  I think Bea Arthur has a better chance this year.  Big star here.  He doesn't know that Jim's goofing on.  No.  Not at all.  Big star right to your right, Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  How you doing?  How's it going?  He was on Last Comic Standing.  Last Comic Standing.  One in three.  I knew that was you. 
[02:37:30]  And my friend, oh my God, I'm totally blanking right now.  Dan Cutworth and Dan produced that show.  Ben Sparks?  Dan produced Last Comic Standing.  Dan and I can't believe I'm blanking out.  Dan and Jane.  Jane.  Yeah, I was only on for one thing when I got in a big argument with, what the fuck's his name,  the old dude that died.  Oh, with Hackett.  Yeah, Buddy Hackett.  Buddy Hackett was supporting hacks.  You got in an argument with Buddy Hackett?  Huge, huge argument with Buddy Hackett.  About what?  It was a guy who was stealing materials.  This guy fucking Ant. 
[02:38:00]  Rogan calls out hacks.  I like Rogan, man.  He calls out hacks.  Wait a second.  How bad does it suck?  Hold on.  As a comic.  Jim, you know I'm a fucking huge fan of your act.  I think you're hysterical.  How bad is it when you see guys biting off your shit?  It's just awful.  It's the worst feeling in the world.  When you spend all that time constructing a bit, writing it out, testing it on stage,  tweaking it.  And some fucking cockless douchebag goes and steals it.  Well, this guy Ant goes on fucking TV, and he's in front of this crowd, and he's doing  old George Carlin shit.  He's doing shit that's from a movie.  He did some hack jokes from the movie Boiler Room, that apparently at one point in time 
[02:38:30]  was Jim David's bit.  It was a gay joke.  It was, you know, the guy says to him, yeah, they should put your people on the line.  They did.  It's called Manhattan.  That's Jim David's joke.  Exactly.  Jim David's joke.  So he did this, and I said, look, I said, Ant, I said, you got great energy.  I said, you know, you're a very likable guy.  You're obviously very talented, very funny.  I saw this.  I remember what you're talking about.  I've heard all those jokes.  I've heard a bunch of them.  Yeah.  So fucking Monique is sitting next to me.  She's going, well, you made it y'all, sugar.  You made that material y'all.  And I'm like, what the fuck are you guys talking about?  And then, buddy, I go, comedy is supposed to be your thoughts. 
[02:39:00]  This is what you see, and this is what makes you funny.  And Buddy Hack goes, you're a fucking asshole.  You know, that guy, I never heard those bits, and you fucking did this.  And then he died like two weeks later.  And it was really funny because at that moment, while it was happening,  while it was happening, that moment, I was like, should I yell at this old cocksucker?  And then I'm like, you know what?  No, I shouldn't.  You know what?  Fuck him.  Let this happen.  If he was a hack or supports hacks, that's fine.  That's fine.  Fuck him, let him die, is what you said.  He died two weeks later.  But I was like, fuck, if I yelled at him right there, I went, fuck you, who are you yelling 
[02:39:30]  at, cocksucker?  If that happened, and I pushed him right over the edge, I could have killed him on TV.  It was an excellent career move that I backed off at that moment.  That would have been in your promo tapes of the show at the Improvs on the road.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  June 22nd through 25th.  I just, you know, I always love it when old people think it's okay that they act like fucking  assholes.  Like, you were an asshole when you were 20.  If you were 20 and you were talking to me like that, I'd smack you in the fucking head.  But because you're 80, like, it's okay. 
[02:40:00]  It's like understood that I'm not going to do anything.  Go ahead, Rich.  The old comics stole from each other anyhow back in the day, so they figured that's how  it goes now.  Well, that's why he's being defensive.  You know, he's just, he's defending himself.  Hold on, hold on.  Back in the day, it was acceptable?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They would take each other's stuff, you know.  Those guys.  Not all of them, no.  Even back in the day, not all of them.  They're just, you know, it was just more common because they didn't have mass media.  There wasn't television.  There wasn't radio.  Nobody knew.  And see you do it somewhere.  Yeah.  You just got to take it.  You could just take it.  You could take a guy's act.  I mean, there's a lot of guys that was their whole act. 
[02:40:30]  It's like, you know, this is where it's TV business.  It's where it makes no sense.  It's TV business.  It's the deep inside of Hollywood.  Thanks, Dan.  Don Carleone had a better job.  The motion picture business.  Shut up.  Here's the thing.  Someone like Ann, who is talentless, is hosting a show on VH1.  Is he?  Well, you know what?  Here's the thing.  He's not talentless.  He's not talentless.  Who?  He just, he's, no, I don't think he's talentless.  I think he's a very good performer.  He's a very entertaining guy.  He's got a lot of energy.  He commits to what he does.  He just doesn't, he's not smart enough to write jokes. 
[02:41:00]  So he takes other people's shit and does it.  And I can't respect that.  But I do think that he's a talented guy.  I just think he's going about it the wrong way.  And a lot of guys, when they start out as open mic, I've seen it many times, guys like  bite a little.  And I remember early in my career, I sounded like other guys.  I'd tell a joke and I'd go, ooh, that sounded like fucking Rich Jenny.  Or that sounded like, you know, it's part of the process of growing.  But the guys who make the big mistake to go off the wrong path is when you start stealing.  And it's very tempting.  It's very tempting.  You're in some fucking bar in Pittsfield, New York, you know, in the middle of nowhere. 
[02:41:30]  And, you know, the fucking crowd is...  You're like, I know some jokes that will get a laugh.  Because right now my fucking act, my miserable act is bombing.  Are you listening to this, Norton?  Yeah.  It's different if I steal, though, because I smile after I say it.  Wink.  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  You're so lovable, sir.  I always credit, like a friend of mine once said, and I'll just do the joke and people always enjoy it.  So, you know, like him hosting a show or something like that, maybe he'd be good at it.  Maybe that's what he, you know, maybe that's what he's supposed to do.  But he's not a fucking comic.  All right.  Do we have an Anthony update? 
[02:42:00]  Anybody?  He's hanging in there, though.  A lot of guys are getting kicked out.  Were you surprised you got knocked out so fast?  Yeah.  You really wanted to...  I realized you've been there for a while.  I'd love playing the game.  At least be able to order another beer, right?  Another beer and, you know, check out the French girl sitting next to Annie.  Did you go all in?  So many hot chicks here.  Yeah.  How many hot chicks?  This is the most hot chicks ever in commerce.  I'm pretty sure that my fiancee does not get satellite radio.  So, yeah, there's a lot of baggable broads here.  A lot of baggable broads.  That's so true because my girlfriend doesn't have it either. 
[02:42:30]  I'll just talk freely.  Go ahead, Ben.  He beats Annie Duke.  He beat Annie Duke in one of the rounds.  Yeah.  So she's the former champion.  Are we talking about the prick?  Yeah.  Okay.  You really don't like Anthony.  Why?  Anthony beat a pro?  He beat the female prick.  I'm just trying to start shit, you know?  I don't like him because there was a bad energy there.  He gave me a dirty look, and he's telling me to, you know, fuck myself.  What?  What's that?  Another guy just beat the dust at Anthony's table.  Anthony's hanging in there strong. 
[02:43:00]  So we had to see two guys at his table so far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure he was nervous.  Yes.  It started out with like 11.  It's down to 8.  You're getting people to come over.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time because Rich Voss doesn't know how to fucking listen.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What were you saying, Kenny?  No, another guy just beat the dust at Anthony's table.  So Anthony's hanging in there.  Yeah.  He's got the nervous leg shake going now.  Does he?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's doing good.  Well, because now he's at the table with two pros.  How many people left at his table?  They're like all.  He's with like all pros and that lawyer who I want to bend over to cross-examine. 
[02:43:30]  You want to bend over Cameron Mannheim?  Why not?  What is wrong with you?  Whoa.  He did lose a lot of weight, but.  No, that's disturbing, dude.  No.  No, I'm happy now.  I got to go and cry.  But I do got a question for the doctor here.  Oh, you got a question?  I'm no longer on that show.  I'm doing Steven Bochco's new series for FX called Over There.  It's about the Iraq War.  Oh, nice.  And I play a sergeant in the squad.  So you're a doctor, right?  I was a doctor on TV.  Is it bad if you've got a lump on your balls?  It is if the balls are in your mouth. 
[02:44:00]  True.  You got a good point.  That's what he went to medical school for.  Yeah.  How many people ask you medical crap because they saw you on the show?  That's fine.  You know, I mean, not really.  I mean, I don't really know.  CBC, Chem 20, type across the floor, cross table, C-spine, chest, and pelvis, order of  it.  We'll pick up the pace in 10 minutes.  Spatial up, chest tube, poly, NG, and flame films in 15 minutes.  It'll either be in CT or the OR, then I'm in Doris Seal.  I do that, and then I'm in.  Nice.  But an actor is more impressive.  That's Trump's doctor, right?  An actor is more impressive.  I don't think it does. 
[02:44:30]  Fake doctor is better than a real doctor.  How funny is that?  If there's no recognition going on, if they don't recognize you from something and you say you're  an actor, that's like the worst thing.  I think it's a horrible thing to say.  Well, no, if they say, well, what have you been on?  You go, I'm on ER, bitch.  Yeah, but if you've got to go to that, you kind of feel like an idiot.  Yeah, but you know what, dude?  As long as you're not bragging about it, you just go, well, I'm on ER.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got to downplay it.  That's how I met my future fiancée.  Do you ever tell a chick that that's not what you do?  Do you ever lie to them? 
[02:45:00]  No.  Just to see how they react?  Tell them that you're a loser?  Well, no.  What I do do is when it's like someone that sees me and recognizes me, and it's like someone that  you know is going to be, like, in your face, and they're like, I know you, right?  Right.  I go, no.  No.  Right.  I do that all the time.  I go, I get that all the time.  I just look like that guy.  You know what I say?  If they say that, I'm like, yeah, you might have seen me on a Megan's Law pamphlet.  I just moved into the neighborhood.  So welcome to the neighborhood.  I used to tell chicks that I work for my father's insurance company.  That was my standard MO.  I say I work for my father's insurance company, and if it got worse, I would say not only did 
[02:45:30]  that, I'm living with my parents.  I live in the basement, but I have my own entrance.  Right.  You know, I'm just trying to save up enough money to get a house.  That's great.  That's right.  I would always say that.  I would always say that, because you'll find out, like, how mean chicks can be.  Yeah.  If a chick doesn't know that you're reasonably successful, whatever you do, they will treat  you like fucking shit.  If they find out you have, like, a regular job, like you're some fucking bartender somewhere,  and you don't have any aspirations, like, whoa, some girls would be fucking vicious, man.  Dude, do you know how awful it is, though?  Like, when I give them my...  If a guy, if the chick has, I'm sorry, if the chick has no aspirations, it's fine if 
[02:46:00]  she's hot.  A girl can be working at fucking Taco Bell.  If she's hot, I'll ask her.  I don't even have any shoes.  I'll buy a shoes.  Let's reverse that for a second.  Let's reverse it and say she's not hot, and she has no aspirations.  Then we could be vicious as well.  Understood, gentlemen?  If she's fat, I don't care what she does for a living.  If she gets prostate cancer, I'll still kick her down the stairs, even though it's impossible  for a woman.  Good improv, stupid.  Guys don't even care.  Guys don't even care a little bit.  You could be a multi-millionaire and a chick could be just totally broke, and you don't 
[02:46:30]  give a fuck.  I don't even have a cell phone.  Tell me what time to knock on your door.  Let's do this.  Let's do this.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, okay.  And we'll check in.  Gentlemen, it was very nice meeting all of you guys.  A pleasure, bro.  Nice to meet you, too, man.  All right.  And, yeah, we'll be back from the World Poker Tour.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from Los Angeles.  Broadcasting, conversation from the locker room.  Everybody was drunk and having sex and shooting guns.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California.  Be happy, be sad, be broke. 
[02:47:00]  El virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  And Anthony XM202.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program live from Los Angeles.  Joe Rogan sitting in for Anthony, doing a great job.  Anthony's at table 14. 
[02:47:30]  And we're looking at the sneaker riot.  What the fuck?  Yeah, that's on the front page of the New York Post.  Dude, at this point, I'm just praying for the fucking aliens to land.  There's a sneaker riot.  A new Nike came out, and they have a riot of people trying to buy this new Nike.  Isn't that amazing?  It's not like it's a cure for cancer or a big dick pill.  It's a fucking sneaker.  And we joke about this all the time.  With everything going on in the world, that's the most important story.  That it has to be on the front page of the New York paper, you know?  Yeah, but they're just losing their minds trying to get their hands on the latest Nike.  And it doesn't even look that cool. 
[02:48:00]  No, it looks stupid.  It looks like the same shit.  Right?  It looks like the same shit.  I don't understand.  What does it do?  I don't know.  I mean, yeah, I don't know.  But the boys in the hood, they understand why it's so freaking cool.  To me, I'm like, yeah, it's a sneaker.  That's what I never understand when they have that show.  You ever watch that show, Cribs?  Of course.  They go in these guys' houses.  They're fucking insane houses, giant multimedia centers, and huge basketball courts.  And then the sneaker collection.  Yeah.  Everybody's got a sneaker collection.  I'm like, what the fuck am I missing?  And they only wear them like once, twice maybe, because then there's like a little scuff on it. 
[02:48:30]  Like, ah, I can't wear those anymore.  Well, that's one of the cool things about being a celebrity is you get free shit.  Like, I get a lot of free shit from Nike.  Like, I call up Nike.  I can call her up and go, hey, I need some new shit.  And they just send me a giant fucking box of sneakers.  I must have like 30 or 40 sneakers at home.  What size are you, bro?  11.  All right.  Give them up.  I think you can get them, too.  I think you can get them, too.  I'll hook you up with a lady.  But, you know.  I don't know.  Anthony and I, we just don't go down that road for some reason.  Yeah, I don't either.  I would love to get free shit, but I don't even know how to go about doing it.  You've got to get a publicist can do everything for you. 
[02:49:00]  But I've been with a Nike lady forever.  Yeah.  All right.  It's a nice deal.  So, Martini Steve is, do you have an update, Steve?  Why?  Travel Mike.  What's the update?  Sweetie.  I don't know.  He ran to the table panicking.  No, it's not a panic.  It's Kenny got Ed Asner to come over.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Good.  Here he comes.  Here we go.  Holy shit.  Lou Grant, baby.  Holy shit.  Lou Grant.  How do you like that?  He has no idea what show he's going on.  I guarantee that.  Oh, wow.  Have a seat.  Mr. Asner.  Hello, Mr. Asner.  Fine. 
[02:49:30]  Fine.  Mr. Asner.  No, I said mine.  Oh, okay.  I thought you said, yeah, fine.  I'm not that overcome.  I'm Opie.  Joe Rogan from Fear Factory.  How are you doing?  Pleasure to meet you.  Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing.  How are you doing?  And Jim Norton.  I loved you in JFK.  Thank you, Jim.  I loved you in a lot of things.  I actually recently watched a documentary that you narrated on the drug war in Columbia.  It was really good.  Yeah, it was a nice piece.  Really, really good.  Really fascinating.  So, Ed, what happened? 
[02:50:00]  You got knocked out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You fall asleep.  You got tired?  I had it.  You fell asleep?  No.  You just got bored out there?  Figuratively.  Yeah.  Figuratively.  Why?  You just got bored?  The table was like, not much action at the table?  And I didn't play well.  Yeah.  I think, isn't that the bottom line?  I didn't play well.  Yeah.  Do you play all the time?  No.  I play straight poker.  Seven, seven, and five.  And I'm still new to Texas Holdings. 
[02:50:30]  It's a great game.  It's taken over the country, though.  I know.  It's a contest of smelling the shorts on the other players.  Yeah.  Excellent way of putting that.  I know.  I never thought Texas Holdings could be hot.  I don't mean that.  I didn't mean that sexually.  Oh, I know.  Don't we mean everything sexually, really?  I used to.  A lot of people feel like, I'm not a big poker player. 
[02:51:00]  My friend loves poker.  Do you feel that in a tournament setting, the cameras and the lights kind of make the whole thing just like, you know, boom?  Make it?  What does boom mean?  Like, just the whole, like, the intensity of the whole thing because of the cameras and lights might set it up differently than, like, under other things.  I really don't.  I mean, I am very, I don't think I'm that much more excited.  Yeah?  What's that?  No, you're trying to kick the mic.  I don't think I'm that much more excited than if I were playing in a high-stakes game in a house. 
[02:51:30]  In this particular game, starting out, of course, I'm very relieved that it's not my money that I'm playing with.  Were you the first to go at your table?  Yeah.  Kind of embarrassing, huh?  What's your name?  Remember, Anthony.  He hates the punk.  You're not a saint, are you?  No, you figured that out right off the bat.  And you never will be. 
[02:52:00]  No, no.  And I don't claim to be, yeah, no.  No, but then, but then.  Well, what do you want us to ask?  The first, the first charging up the hill to take the hill who gets killed is not necessarily a loser.  I didn't say you were a loser.  Yes, you did.  You implied this much.  Look, you know what?  I'm smart.  You didn't.  No, he didn't piss me off.  No, I'm smart.  I don't like, I don't like that implication at all.  I don't like that implication.  I can't believe you're doing that.  He's trying to show that he's better than I am.  I don't like that at all.  He really is. 
[02:52:30]  No, I mean, you survived 20 minutes.  That's not bad.  20 minutes.  Once again, he's belittling me.  Unbelievable.  Disrespect.  I don't do that.  He sounds like a drug lord to me.  He looks like it, too.  I couldn't sit at these tables.  No?  No, the guy I do the radio show with, he was brave enough to get in there.  I'm not claiming to be brave enough.  But he wouldn't give you the money?  No, they know he was better for this than I.  I'm good at just being a jerk.  I don't know. 
[02:53:00]  Don't backtrack.  Please.  Okay, go ahead.  Let's move on.  Let's move on a little bit, please.  Backtrack.  Is there an awkward feeling?  Not at all.  I just don't like the fact that you implied that about Mr. Asner.  He's here to help out with the radio show.  How dare you?  Well, there's still three, four hundred pounds still playing.  Let's see.  He made me a loser.  And then he called himself a jerk.  Now, does that equate?  Well, I didn't say you were a loser.  Yes, you did.  No, no, no.  Yes, you did.  No.  Oh, no.  Where are we going with this? 
[02:53:30]  Where's the car crash now when you need it?  Look at the sweat coming off my head.  I'm usually pretty good at this, but I'm losing this one.  Do you think that in this day and age that I would condemn you?  I mean, I've had to deal with people like Sean Hannity.  Sean's a good friend of ours.  Is he?  Yeah.  I don't agree with his politics, but he's a good friend of ours.  Why?  We were on his show a few times.  He's no conservative.  I don't like conservatives at all.  What's your opinion of him?  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:00]  Sean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I think he's a mannequin.  What's a mannequin?  That's a big word for me.  You don't know what a mannequin is?  I think he's a mannequin mannequin.  He's very stiff.  Right.  Oh, no.  He's not stiff, but he's too pretty.  He really is too.  He really should be modeling clothes.  Yeah.  He doesn't belong on TV.  Give me some point of view.  He really doesn't belong on TV.  Only ugly people should be on TV, right?  I think, you know, Sean is very good in this day and age because he has such a warped political 
[02:54:30]  ideology that seems to be going very well right now.  Big Bush supporter.  Yeah.  You know, so I'm, you know.  You're the biggest dick.  No, I'm not.  Hannity is like that.  He's absolutely right.  Hannity is a very, very conservative pundit.  Well, you weren't aware of that, Anthony?  No, I'm, uh-huh.  That's not really Anthony.  That's Opie.  He's lying.  What's his name?  His real name is Opie.  Opie.  I see.  Anthony's playing cards.  I see.  I can't let this happen.  The great Asner.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ed, can I ask you a question? 
[02:55:00]  Do you feel like you were on one of the-  Where is this radio show heard?  This is XM.  All over the country.  All over the country.  All over the country.  This casino.  I have a question.  Have you ever heard the Banana Phone?  No.  It's a great song.  We'll play it going in a break or something.  You were on one of the greatest shows in history.  One of the greatest comedies to ever be on television.  Do you feel that, like, what do you think about the comedy today?  Do you think it's watered down on television, what they're passing off as comedy?  How do you feel about the comedies that are on now?  I'm a friend.  I love Curb Your Enthusiast.  Yeah.  Great show.  That's my favorite show.  I like that a lot. 
[02:55:30]  That a feel factor.  I don't watch.  I don't watch that either.  But, unfortunately, I don't watch the others.  What do you like?  I don't like Mary Kyla Moore.  I like Action.  Who do you know?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You look back at the old shows like Sanford and Son, All in the Family.  There was so much better.  There was so much better.  The sitcoms were so much better.  But, Mary, tell me why.  Everybody in the show got their own spin-off show.  Everybody.  From Weatherman, Gordon.  They all had their own show.  That's how good it was.  It was a great fucking show. 
[02:56:00]  That was a great observation.  You didn't know that?  Everyone.  Of course I did.  No, you didn't.  You can say fuck on it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's totally uncensored.  It's phenomenal.  Who do you want to curse out first?  Well, let's see.  Did we cover Hannity all the way?  Okay.  Who's left?  Rush Limbaugh.  Oh, well.  The Herman Goering of radio.  Nice.  No, I don't have any. 
[02:56:30]  But Kerry just didn't have a shot.  He didn't stand up for anything during the election.  Well, he did tend to self-destruct, didn't he?  I mean, I was rooting for him.  The weirdest thing to me was how everybody just threw Dean down the sewer after that one  crazy speech.  But it wasn't crazy.  You don't even know what happened there, do you?  I do.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't know.  Can I show my knowledge?  What did you know?  He was yelling because he couldn't be heard.  That's all. 
[02:57:00]  But do you understand that they gave him a microphone?  Right.  Which the media uses to block out exterior noises.  It's called a unidirectional.  Whatever.  Oh, so the crowd was going crazy.  Yeah, the crowd was going crazy.  And he was trying to shout so he could be heard to the crowd.  The microphone cut out the crowd noises so that he sounded like a lunatic on the microphone.  Why do you think they kept looping it and showing it on...  Because it's Republican media.  No, no.  Republican-controlled media absolutely sold him down the river. 
[02:57:30]  Maybe it was because the Clintons wanted Hillary to...  Oh, my God.  They didn't want him to...  No.  No, listen.  I think everybody's wrong.  I think it was the most sensational thing to talk about.  I mean, look, it was fucking ridiculous.  I don't think there was any conspiracy.  I think if you watch that tape, it's fucking hysterical.  The guy screaming,  Hey, we're going to go to Washington!  And you're like, whoa, this guy wants to be president?  He's out of his fucking mind.  At that point, it didn't matter why it...  Yeah, you've got to run with that.  It happened.  They had to run with it.  But, yeah, that's exactly what happened.  The crowd was really into what he was saying.  It was insane. 
[02:58:00]  But you didn't get to hear the crowd.  He sounded like a maniac.  But from the very beginning, the Republicans were spreading the story when Dean was doing...  Started out doing well in Iowa that they couldn't wait for him to gain the nomination because they knew they could beat him.  They spread that story.  The Democrats bought it hook, line, and sinker, which is why they so fell easily into the trap of going to Kerry in Iowa.  There you go.  And I do think the Republican media kind of sold him down after that. 
[02:58:30]  They kept showing it because, you know, like ABC, CBS, they're all very, very conservative.  And they definitely, you know, Dan Rather, they're all very conservative.  And they did attack him and kind of throw him to the wolves like that.  Yeah, well, you know, thank God he became...  He did win the head of the DNC.  You trying to get rid of me?  Yes, sort of.  What are you doing, Ben?  Ben, what are you doing?  We're making sign language.  What's the sign language?  Ed, that's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring. 
[02:59:00]  And that was the sign that...  What the fuck?  ...that he usually gives.  More disrespecting.  Well, I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was...  Yeah, Ben.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Be sure that he's not in there. 
[02:59:30]  I know.  He does this all the time.  I hope he helps.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He is a...  He is a...  He's a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  Destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He built nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Sven-Galala.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Kenny, yes?  We got Superman.  Yeah, I know.  Where's Norton going and where's Voss going?  Oh, you're getting photos and stuff? 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Thank you, Ed Asner.  What is this?  Yeah, well, sit him down there.  Everyone is getting pictures with Ed Asner.  Dude, you went after Ed Asner.  I didn't go after him.  Oh, my God.  You so hurt him.  We were just having fun.  I think he was really upset.  I guess he didn't really get our sense of humor.  No.  The goof.  It's hard for people to get the goof, dude.  Actually, he's a legend, and I loved Mary Talbot more growing up. 
[03:00:30]  A lot of the old guys don't get the goof.  They don't want to.  Come on.  But I can't be something of that.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  Oh, it was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started sweating.  No, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you, they said.  No, fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, that's phenomenal.  We'll never have lunch in this time again.  Never have lunch in this time.  Wait, get him on mic.  Get him on mic.  He's like cursing me out and stuff as he's walking away.  I don't know if I hate Oprah or if he's my hero.  Oh, I didn't give a fuck.  Dude, what's up, man?  How you doing, man?  Jim.  I've seen you on Last Comic Standing.  Oh, thanks.  You could have won that thing.  Thank you.  A lot of people said that.  Not that I should have won, but I should have kept going, but I had a contract that I saw.  Dude, phenomenal tonight show set.  I saw you on there, too.  Thank you.  Jim, phenomenal tonight show set. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, thank you, Joe.  I heard it.  I didn't see it.  I heard it on the radio.  Fucking phenomenal.  Oh, thanks, man.  Really funny shit.  I was laughing my ass off.  Thanks, buddy.  The body of a scallop.  I remember her.  Oh, my God.  That was awesome.  Listen, I just got a bear hug from Ed Ashton.  Ed Ashton's fucking strong, dude.  We made good.  I know.  Dude, I'm usually pretty good at that.  I was sweating so freaking bad.  He was looking right through me.  Do you understand?  He was looking right through me.  Dude, you want to talk about a poker face.  I usually have a great poker face.  I just can't play cards.  He got to me.  I agreed that the media was conservative. 
[03:02:00]  Do you know what a liar and a whore I did?  That's why I always said that.  I hate the left.  I thought you were just playing with him.  I called you out on that, and you sold me down the river.  Oh, boy, did I.  Big time.  That was a lot of fun.  He was great.  He was about that one, man.  Oh, he was great.  I was uncomfortable sitting here next to me.  I was really...  I go...  When I go...  That's the sign Ben gives when the guests are really boring.  Oh, my God.  All you guys just look straight down at the floor.  Who's the guy he's talking to?  It's a very new show.  I'm getting... 
[03:02:30]  What's that?  I don't even know who you are.  I'm not going to lie.  What's up, buddy?  You know.  What's the note?  Yeah, well, can you read that, Joe?  Ben's like, I gave you the note.  Daniel...  No, you're a professional...  You're a pro...  Negraño.  Negraño.  Yeah.  And you're a pro poker player.  You're a professional poker player.  A poker player?  And you got knocked out?  Yeah.  What happened?  Damn.  Talk right into the mic there.  I was just goofing around, pretty much.  I take this thing very lightly.  It's kind of fun.  Dude, this is Ed Norton in that fucking movie.  I get that a lot.  Seriously.  I get that a ton.  He's a pro poker player, and he sounds like it. 
[03:03:00]  What was that, Rounders?  Is that what it was?  That was Rounders.  So that's what you do, dude.  You play poker professionally.  That's it.  You look like a young guy.  How old are you?  30 years old.  And you play poker professionally.  What a fucking cool job that is.  And what celebrity beat you today?  I didn't lose to a celebrity.  I don't even know who I lost to.  Some random dude I'd never seen before.  Really?  Yeah.  I was, like I said, just goofing around, having fun.  Wow.  A pro's out, and Anthony's still out there playing.  That's not too shabby.  That is.  That's pretty impressive.  How much money have you won playing poker?  I've won more than anybody else in tournament poker.  Last year, I won about $4.5 million.  Holy shit! 
[03:03:30]  Oh my God.  Holy shit!  Are you kidding?  Holy fucking shit.  So you won $4.5 million playing cards?  Last year, I did.  Yes.  Last year.  Last year, he said.  When he said I was just fooling around out there, I'm like, now I believe it.  He's like, ah.  Dude, you're a pro poker player.  Wow.  How many years have you been doing this?  I started playing when I was about 17, 18 years old.  And how long pro?  How long have you been playing?  I guess when I was 18.  I mean, I didn't have a real job.  I worked as a telemarketer for a day, and that wasn't me.  Holy shit.  I don't like people telling me what to do.  $4.5 million. 
[03:04:00]  What do you think, all told, you've made?  Well, in tournaments, I'm the winningest tournament poker player in the history of poker.  That's like $7 or $8 million.  God damn!  Overall, I don't know, with cash games and stuff, I figure like $12 million.  So basically, you just weren't in.  Fuck!  You won millions of dollars in cash games?  Like in crazy hotel rooms and shit?  Mostly casinos.  No, that's like back in the old days.  Poker's evolved now.  Has that ever happened, though?  Do you ever have some crazy basement game with a bunch of hoodlums?  And you talk to a guy like Doyle Brunson, he'll tell you a lot of stories like that.  But I've been robbed before.  Really?  Back in the day. 
[03:04:30]  Back in the day in Toronto.  What happened?  Well, I just got robbed by a couple guys in an elevator.  They were cool, though.  You know, they didn't beat me up or nothing.  They just took the money.  Is this Canadian money you're talking about?  That was Canadian money back then.  That's crazy.  When you go, after you're done playing poker, do you ever go shoot crafts or something for  excitement, for real excitement?  Not really.  When I moved to Vegas, I knew it was pretty important that I had to like stick to poker.  That's it?  Wow.  Poker.  Yeah.  So you treat it like a career.  He goes right to the bank.  Right to the bank with cash.  You just treat it like a career, right?  It is a real job.  Do you read books on it and practice?  I write books.  I don't read them.  You write books? 
[03:05:00]  No, I've read a bunch of them, but I don't really think there's a lot of books out there  right now that are really going to teach you what you need to know.  Do you practice or do you just play?  I mean, do you like go over strategy?  Like how do you, what do you do?  I did that when I was learning and stuff and I was getting better.  But at this point, there's not much left for me to like learn from that kind of stuff.  So basically your whole job is just playing cards, period.  Yeah.  No preparation, just play cards.  What's the coolest thing you've bought?  Coolest thing I bought?  Yeah, because I mean, you're like us.  You didn't have money growing up at first, right?  No, no.  And then all of a sudden you realize you could play this poker and you're doing so well. 
[03:05:30]  What was that one?  I guess it would be the Lexus SC430 convertible.  Which is a fun car.  It's good for Vegas.  You get the top down.  Paid cash, right?  I did too.  They were freaked out.  I actually brought like $80,000 in cash and they like counted out one by one.  Like 100 by 100.  I'm like, we've never had this before.  This is new for us.  That's a little understated too for a guy that's that rich.  I would think he'd be trolling around in a Ferrari or something.  No, I like that car.  It's a fun car.  Have you seen it?  It's a fun car.  He's trying to defend his ride.  Yeah.  It's a pimp ride. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, he's trying to defend his whip.  And you were the Toyota Poker Player of the Year?  I was the ESPN Toyota Player of the Year, World Poker Tour Player of the Year, Card Player of the Year, Champion Player of the Year.  Put a Player of the Year.  I was it.  Norton's a big, big fan of poker.  I just get too intimidated.  And I'm not a good player.  Here we go.  A friend of mine wanted to become a pro.  And do you think that a guy who wants to, I mean, look, he plays.  I just kind of enjoy it.  But do you think that a guy who wants to become a pro, I mean, the whole setup out here is just kind of geared towards, like, you know, just making it kind of, like, happen and all that stuff, like, from. 
[03:06:30]  What are you talking about?  Thank you.  Oh.  What in the world is this guy talking about?  Gotcha.  It's all about making it happen.  Making what happen?  He's taught you.  Becoming a pro.  Ha, ha.  He got you.  What I'm saying is to make it happen, being a pro, you're a pro.  And it's a lot different than, like, when someone's an amateur playing amateur poker.  So what I'm saying is the lights and the camera kind of what makes the whole game.  The whole pro thing, I mean, people throw that term around, like, a pro.  What's the difference between a pro and an amateur?  That's what I'm trying to do.  It's kind of silly, because when I was 23 years old, and people said, well, what do you do for a living? 
[03:07:00]  I said, nothing.  What do you have to play cards?  I said, well, wasn't I a pro?  I mean, I didn't know I was a pro, but I guess I was.  Anybody can call themselves a pro and suck at poker.  Or, you know, if you don't have a job and you're a bum, say I'm a pro, pretty much.  Very interesting.  Cool.  Yeah.  No shit.  So do you have poker groupies?  Poker groupies.  Well, I was engaged, but I'm no longer, for the last three days.  Good for you.  That's a yes.  Good for you.  Good for you.  The last three days.  Shut up, Bridgewater.  Three days ago, yeah.  Wait, there's a story here.  There's a story here.  There's a story here.  Three days ago, he called it quits with the kid. 
[03:07:30]  Nice.  What happened?  Well, we basically didn't.  Everything was good.  We got along great, except for a couple minor things, you know, politics, religion, and the way  to raise our kids, so, yeah, just a couple things.  Those are a little big.  Who's the religious one?  Well, I mean, we just did philosophies about, you know, our approach and things like that.  Who did him start with religion?  Who's, uh, Joe's religion?  She's a lot more conservative than I was.  Oh, yeah.  A little, you know, on certain issues.  Yeah.  She wanted to raise the kids in, like, some sort of religious school.  Well, I got this thing.  My dad, when I was 17 years old, I'd sit out in the pool when I was 17, and we'd have 
[03:08:00]  a drink, we'd have a glass of wine.  And she's like, but that's illegal.  I'm like, I'm not letting the government raise my kids.  Oh, my God.  I was like, exactly, right?  And I'm like, you're kidding me, right?  She said, well, we don't want to have alcohol in the house.  I'm like, whose house?  My house?  I don't think the house.  The house that I'm paying for?  Was she really hot?  She was cute.  Now, do you think now you broke up with her, you just think about other dudes just gorilla  fucking her?  Does that want you?  That's what I always think of.  I'm being honest.  Whenever I break up with a chick, the first thing I think of is some other guy fucking  stuffing her into the corner of a couch, just fucking slamming it, coming in her 
[03:08:30]  face.  That's all I ever think about.  I think about her liking it.  I think, shit.  I just let her go.  And then that's the worst thing that could ever happen to you, is you break up with a  really hot chick, and then during the soft period where it hasn't hardened, some other  guy just...  There's a book called Arousal you should read.  It's plain what that's all about.  It's honest.  It's just natural male chimpanzee instincts.  I'm so enjoying that.  Come on, man.  It doesn't bother you, the idea of some other guy fucking the shit out of her?  Not really.  Her loving it, her worshiping some other guy's cock. 
[03:09:00]  This is the woman that you love, and she's just got her tongue out, and she's rubbing  her tongue out, and she's coming in her face and closing her eyes, it's dripping off  her fake eyelashes.  That doesn't bother you.  It bothers me, and I don't even know you.  One other thing, the guy's black.  It bothers me.  And you're not spanking it to that thought?  What's wrong with you?  All right.  Well, Daniel, thank you.  It was a pleasure.  You got it, guys.  Dude, that's a very interesting job, man.  Congrats for having the balls to pursue it.  Thanks, man.  Seriously, that's cool.  Appreciate it, guys.  4.5 million. 
[03:09:30]  Very impressive.  That's awesome, man.  That's fucking awesome.  Did you get the ring back?  Did you get the ring back?  The ring back?  We're in a discussion over the logistics of that kind of stuff.  Fuck her.  Let her keep the ring.  Rot with it.  All right.  Take that thing.  There he goes.  Take it to heaven with you.  Good job, buddy.  Take it to Valhalla.  And there's Jim getting more of his celebrity photos.  Eatabullet.com t-shirt on.  It's just a whore.  Or I stink in an eatabullet.com t-shirt.  Oh, did he really?  Oh, that's awesome.  That's awesome. 
[03:10:00]  I got to tell you guys, man.  This is pretty impressive.  Anthony's still out there.  Thanks.  You know, we're too.  Anthony's a bad motherfucker.  One of the best got knocked out, and Anthony's still at his table.  He's down to like six people over there.  Yeah, something like that.  Dean Cain, Superman's in the house.  What's up, man?  How you doing, buddy?  I got knocked out like everybody else.  I guess you can just come over here, huh?  What's going on?  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Hi, Dean.  Jim from New Jersey.  Ben's handing me a note.  Dean Cain is here.  I went to school in New Jersey, man.  Where about?  Princeton.  Oh, that's a little north of me.  I'm from North Project.  I was born in Newark.  Oh, really?  All right, cool.  Without New Jersey, none of us would be here.  Plainfield.  Wow.  I'm from Plainfield. 
[03:10:30]  Wait, so that guy's in the audience.  The poker man got knocked out?  Yeah, yeah.  He got knocked out.  He made $4.5 million last year playing poker.  And he's out of this tournament.  Yeah.  Yeah, he said.  What did he say?  He said he was just fucking around.  Yeah, he was just fucking around today.  He wasn't feeling it.  He didn't feel like going through the whole process, I think.  I was doing the same thing.  Plus, he lost his chick.  He lost his chick three days ago, so he's all broken up.  Yeah, his mind's somewhere else.  Oh, wow.  He should be drinking.  He's trying to get his ring back.  What finally knocked you out?  I mean, what kind of hand did you have?  I actually had two pair with an ace kicker.  So I actually was in good shape. 
[03:11:00]  The guy flopped a five on the river to give him a straight.  Oh, wow.  So I was in good shape.  And I started learning poker last night at midnight.  My buddy was teaching me.  So we played from midnight to three.  I had three McAllen rocks.  I woke up with a little bit of a headache.  And I'm dreaming about cards.  So I thought, you know, I'm like, all right, I'm going to be good today.  And then we got into this.  Were you the first out at your table?  Yeah, first out at my table.  But I also, at that time, I had already amassed the most chips at the table. 
[03:11:30]  Myself and this other guy had quietly.  And we went head-to-head.  And he, listen, when we shook hands, he's like, all right, great.  We shook hands.  His hand was soaking wet.  Really?  As nervous as could be.  And he's one of these, you know, pro guys.  Maybe he's just one of those sweaty, awful people.  He could be that.  He could, but I don't think so.  He was one of those guys who looked very, very serious about this game.  Some people just perspire a lot, though.  They're just disgusted.  They transfer the duck virus and they shake your hand.  No, your duck virus.  My hands are very dry.  Very dry.  That's the new virus you got to worry about, the duck virus.  Yeah, it's over in Asia or something like that. 
[03:12:00]  Now they're saying that the flies are infected people.  That's good.  Yes, great.  That's wonderful.  Another thing to be excited about.  How long has your show been on?  Which show?  Aren't you playing Superman?  Yeah, I did that 10 years ago.  I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  Are you serious?  It's all right, man.  I don't watch TV.  I don't know.  Don't worry about it.  It's all right.  That's all right.  See his shirt over there, the flaming ass?  Yeah.  I have nothing to do with it.  Oh, not anymore?  Okay.  No, that's a while ago.  Does it bother you that there's sort of like a curse that's attached to all the supermen?  It's kind of a weird thing, though, really, right? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, but it's like, you know, everybody who's ever, you know, president of the United States,  except for like six guys, they're all dead.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, but they're old.  Yeah, exactly.  I know, I know.  I'm not trying to freak you out.  No.  It sounds like it freaks you out a little bit.  No.  It sounds like it freaks you out a little bit.  Come on.  Come on.  One guy killed himself.  The other guy got paralyzed.  I mean.  But there was another guy before that.  There was another guy before that.  Kirk Allen.  What happened to him?  He'd be like 96 years old.  Oh, okay.  Well, there you go.  That's my tough car.  That's my five on the board.  Two for four.  But Dean went back in history to make sure.  Okay, look.  There was a guy.  What, the 1946 cereals?  Wait a minute. 
[03:13:00]  What is this?  Is it maybe that when a new superman comes along, that's when the old one gets all fucked up?  You know what?  Maybe that's what it is.  That may be the case.  Because when you came along.  Yes.  And now there's a new one that's going to.  Ooh, jeez.  You're the only guy to ever put that together.  Fuck, dude.  If I was you, I'd wear one of those big rubber crash collars.  Just walk around.  I wear a helmet at home.  That might be a good move.  I have to ask you this.  How many chicks banged you just because of that role?  They had to want to bang you because of that.  Well, you're going to have to ask the chicks that.  Because I figured they wanted to do that sort of business because I was charming and I went to school in New Jersey. 
[03:13:30]  That's what I was kind of hoping.  I really didn't do it.  That gives me hope then, if that works.  Because I went to school in New Jersey and I still have to hand over 300 after.  Come on, it was only a little golden shower.  Yeah, Jim's into something a little different, Dean.  300 for a golden shower.  Yeah, really.  It's awful.  They don't do full service.  Full service.  Yeah.  So do you feel like playing on it?  Because I never played in a tournament of any kind.  I get too nervous.  Shut up. 
[03:14:00]  Do you feel that playing in a setting like this is conducive with getting knocked out?  Or is it like one of those things that you just have to kind of like, you know, go, well, this is what's going to happen.  You know, whatever.  I don't know.  I mean, I've never played before.  I don't have a concept.  I have no idea what's going on here.  It would throw me all these people.  I didn't care.  I don't know.  I mean, I was the guy.  Like I said, the guy was very nervous.  His hand was all sweaty.  It was very important to him to be in.  I was having a good time.  All right.  I just picked my mom up from the airport.  There's my mom over there.  She's sitting there.  Hi, Mom.  Hello.  She's reading poker players.  She's reading poker players. 
[03:14:30]  I picked her up from the airport.  She doesn't want me to stay very long.  Okay.  So I figured I'd bet early and see what happens.  Were you playing for charity?  Yes.  What charity?  Can you say?  I was playing for basically a boys and girls club.  It's called the Malibu Foundation for Youth and Family.  I grew up in Malibu, California.  Okay.  So if you get knocked out, they don't get any money, or do they still get sucked?  Well, I donate money to them anyway.  You know what?  I've got to go ask people that.  That's a good question.  It's kind of depressing.  They're sitting there hungry or whatever.  I hope you can do well.  Well, you know, the kids in Malibu are so underprivileged, right?  That's what they always say.  That's a joke.  But the reality is, you know, it's a good place.  There are a lot of kids out there who need someplace to go after school, and it's a great situation. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Well, Dean, thanks for stopping by.  Thanks so much, man.  We're going to take a break here.  Dean Cain.  It's the Opian Anthony program live from what?  Oh, yeah, we're going to play Bananaphone at the break?  Yes.  Yeah, why don't we do the Bananaphone, and we'll continue with the Opian Anthony program live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone. 
[03:15:30]  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, bananaphone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone.  Ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping, banana phone 
[03:16:00]  It's no baloney, it ain't a phony  My cellular, banana phone  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  What are you talking about?  I sit here, I make some asinine comments, and I check the computer 
[03:16:30]  And you're a good squeezer  It is insane  The Opie and Anthony Show  Life in corporate America can be a grind  All they do is they remove the humor from everything  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem  I'm standing here with this erection  I'm feeling silly  You're gonna need some sound advice  Talk less and suck more  From a qualified professional  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts  New from the Hiv Corporation 
[03:17:00]  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook  Sensitivity training, maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in  And they can tickle my bag a little  And I can go, ooh, very sensitive area  And then they can leave  Jim will help you construct a business plan  Greed is good  He'll guide you through the hiring process  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed  He's also a whiz at customer relations  Here's what you do, stupid  When they complain, you go, click  You take the phone  Click  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations 
[03:17:30]  You send them to training to not have those big kids showing during the workday  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships  I killed my wife with a hammer  And he'll also assist with time management  130, Human Resources attempts to talk about sensitivity training  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves  As he walks outdoor  Ha ha! 
[03:18:00]  End of meeting  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook  Order today  Meeting adjourned  All right  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program  Broadcasting live from the World Poker Tour  In Los Angeles, California  Believe it or not, Anthony is hanging in there  Yes, he is  Very impressive  Club Soda Kenny, though, during the break said that his chips are dwindling 
[03:18:30]  Right, Steve?  What, is he down his last few now?  We don't have your mic on  Can we get his mic on?  Ben  Thank you  What's going on?  He's down to his last few chips, but he is hanging in there  He just, but from what I'm hearing, a really, really, really big time pro who won the last  What?  What?  No, it's Ben  Ben with the herky  Oh  Ben didn't do anything  Yes, he does  Oh, okay  What were you going to say, Steve? 
[03:19:00]  He's hanging in there just fine, except he's dwindling  His chips are dwindling  And he's at a table with all pros and Cameron Manheim  And he's looking like he's not  Cameron Manheim knows how to play poker, huh?  Yeah  Yeah, that's pretty obvious  He's hanging in there  All right  Where did Ed Asner go?  I'm obsessed with Ed Asner now  How can you not be?  Kenny's been looking at the celebrities, seeing who's kicked out  Yeah, here comes Kenny  Kenny's been grabbing a lot of guests for us  Good job  Anthony's pile is dwindling, I'm sad to say  Yeah  He's against pros, I mean, you know 
[03:19:30]  Yeah  He's amazing  He's still there  He looks like he's having fun, though  Well, he's finally looking very relaxed  Yeah  He just didn't want to be the first guy kicked out today  Right, right  No, he's doing a respectable job  Because in the end, no one's going to care as long as he wasn't the first guy out  Yeah  Because he's not going to be at this table tomorrow  Yeah  That's the table to be at, Joe, right there  And I want to thank Mr. Rogan for picking up the slack  For the radio show  He's doing a fine job  I'll say  Everyone loves Joe Rogan  Joe kicked ass today 
[03:20:00]  Yes, he did  He always does  He sure did  Thank you, Kenny  Well, we got more people, Steve?  No, I just  What, Steve?  That men, the master guy  Anthony just trounced him  He folded and Anthony's got a big pile of chips in front of him now  Wow  Anthony's making a fucking comeback  A huge comeback  And there's a lot of action at his table  The camera crews are over there right now  Look, Kenny's rushing back  Kenny's rushing back, yes?  Anthony just cashed in  He beat Min the master  Wow  He's like back in there  Is Min still in, though?  Yeah, yeah, but he made him fold 
[03:20:30]  He made the master fold  Yeah, yeah  So now he's got chips  All right, good  Can you imagine if Anthony actually does make it to this table?  That would rock  That would be fantastic  Well, we were talking to one of the guys  And they say it is possible that, you know, every once in a while  You get some kind of, you know, long shot that goes a long way  I don't know  Maybe we're underestimating how good Anthony actually is  I agree  Anthony actually is a very smart guy  He's very smart  He's incredibly smart  And, you know, he downplays it  But I think he knows what he's doing  Anybody that can do a Tony Dan's impression  That's good 
[03:21:00]  You can't underestimate him  You know, Tony Dan's is on to us now  We haven't been able to work that line in about two or three months  That's too bad  That was one of the funniest fucking things I've ever heard in my life  What's up, Voss?  I just got Morgan Freeman coming in  Where is he?  Please  Are you serious?  No  We're trying to get Deacon Jones back  He's outside drinking like a maniac on the patio  Is he really?  Smoking  Smoking and drinking  Yeah  We have no more celebs  I don't think we have any more celebs  Where's LeVar Burton?  I want to get him  Just tell him to come over here 
[03:21:30]  Jim's got extra memory sticks  I know, Jim, after the broadcast  You'll get all your celebrity photos  You don't have to ask LeVar Burton  You just have to tell him  You know, that old role will come back and he'll walk over  I said, get over here, boy  No  Well, he was in the movie  That's a long time ago  All right, well  We were hoping to get Anthony  Before the end of the broadcast  But he made a huge comeback  And I think he's going to be playing for a while  How long do they play  Until it gets down to the last table here?  The eight spots?  Is that what happens?  Yeah  So Anthony can be here for a few more hours easily  They're all pointing at somebody over there 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, but don't they take a break?  Don't they come back tomorrow?  Is it an elimination?  I think tomorrow is the big, you know  Where they broadcast the finals right there in front of us  They've got the cameras and everything set up  So if Anthony wins all this money  Does he have to donate it to a charity?  Yeah, what happens with Anthony's money?  Look, Anthony's  He's giving us  Yeah, he's getting a little more cocky  He just gave us a thumbs up  From table 14  I knew he would last  Yes  Quite a while  I might not have been real funny  But I had a lot of good questions today 
[03:22:30]  Terrific  What are you talking about?  I really didn't like that one  He's assessing himself  I might not have been funny  But I feel like I had some good questions  He does this every time  He goes on all the message boards  One stupid person will trash him  And then he can't sleep  Do you like talking shit on the internet?  I love talking shit on message boards  It's one of my funniest things  Oh, I love it  I love getting little flame wars with people  I can't be bothering  Oh, I love it  Wait, I love it  Ten minute break  So Anthony will be able to come over  Ten minute break?  Nice  Here he's up  Oh, he's up  Oh, this is great  This is perfect timing  I want to go get some celebrity pictures  Perfect timing  Because this show is dying right now 
[03:23:00]  We gave all the energy we had  Now we can get Anthony  A little update from Anthony  He's walking back to the table  Perfect time for him to walk back  Anthony hanging in there  He just had a great hit  Hanging tough  Anthony  Hello, people  Hello  Beef master men  Or whatever the fuck that guy is  Yeah, what happened  And the master  Yeah, what happened  Because Kenny came running back  And said that you took him  Yes, I certainly did  I took him silly  Did you really?  It was a big pile of chips though  Nothing real  It wasn't bad 
[03:23:30]  It was nothing out of the ordinary though  Look how close he is  This is the same guy that  This is the same guy that we sent off  To swim with the Sharks  What's her name?  Cameron Manheim over there?  Yeah  She's playing at your table  She's good, right?  She's killing  She's knocked off like  You talked to one of the guys  That she knocked off  The ER guy  Yeah, the ER guy  Is she really good?  Apparently so  She's got a huge stack of chips  She's like the chip leader there  Wow  And I'm sitting there  It's like they put me at a goddamn pro table  They're all like  Everyone I'm looking at is pros 
[03:24:00]  And then a couple of guys leave  So the seats are empty  Who comes over?  Fucking Phil Gordon  Who's just like  You know  A legend  Great  Great player  Sits down  And now he's right next to me  So you can just join in?  You can go to other tables?  Yeah, I guess some tables  Some tables go out  Yeah  As some tables go out  They fill the spaces at other tables?  Oh wow  Yeah, some people  You know  If the table runs out  You know  They kill everybody  We looked at you  When you first started  And I'm like  You're like freaking out  I could tell there were big names  At your table 
[03:24:30]  Like what?  I don't know  Huge  Just huge names  Oh what's going on?  What do you think's going on?

[03:25:00]  It's okay  Because this is satellite radio  Alright I'm just hanging in there  But the aunties  They just started with the aunties  And you know  When the aunties kick in  That's time to start stealing  So I'm  I'm stealing my nerve  To start stealing  The problem is  Everyone else is trying to steal  The aunties before me  Yeah  So  What does that mean?  It's when  There's a pot in there  There's money in the pot  And you have nothing  And you bet like $5,000  You bet big  Hoping everyone else  Is going to fold  And it was like  Oh look  The girly girl has pocket aces  And then they all fold 
[03:25:30]  And then you take all the money  In the pot  That hasn't happened yet  But you get these pros  That look right through you  And go  You're so full of shit  That's right  And then pop down  My very first hand though  I sat down  I got quad tens  I slow played it  Which means  I really got  Hardly any money at all  Yeah  Wait a minute  I was like  I have a monster hand  I better start checking  Are we speaking a foreign language?  Wow  Quad tens  Poker language  Are you a serious poker player?  No not really  But my boyfriend is  So he yells at me  Like once  I fell to two people 
[03:26:00]  And he was like  That's the most bonehead play  I ever saw in my life  So  That's not very supportive  Well you know  He knows everything  He's taught me everything  He knows  But I've only absorbed  About 20% of it  Now I'm not a very good  Poker player  Yes  A friend of mine played  Do you feel  Do you feel  That the whole  Like lights  And atmosphere  Kind of contributes  And makes things  Like really  Like you know  The way it kind of  Comes out  Makes the lights  And atmosphere  Makes it kind of  The way it comes out  Like the whole  The whole  The whole like  Pressure of the cameras  And stuff like that 
[03:26:30]  Oh you mean  It makes people  Behave in different ways  Yes I've seen people  Behave more crazy  When they get to  The final table  And then they start  Doing like talking stuff  Like performing  For the camera  Right  I'm always the same person  Whether the camera's  On or off  But usually  The camera's on  It takes a lot of people  Out of their game  And my friend  Used to play a lot  And he said  That you'd be amazed  How many times  People just like  You know  Well a lot of my friends  Who are the pros  They say  One of the difficulties  Is everyone watches  It on TV now  So now they'll go  Like Gus Hanson  I'll go to the casino

[03:31:30]  Has a  Nice little  He's doing great  There we go  Got a nice little  Spring to your step  That's better  I took a leak  I've been drinking water  Over there  Dude how psyched were you  That you weren't the first  To pick it up on the table  I've taken a couple of pots  I'm folding a lot  I'm not really taking  Oh we're getting updates  And you were playing  Very conservative  You know just  Folding a lot  Whatever I've played  I've won  So I'm being conservative  Are you up?  Yeah 
[03:32:00]  Well you just made a big comeback  The thing is it's hard to be up  When you're being conservative  Because you've got to keep  Putting in the blinds  And now there's an ante  That also has to be put in  In the blind bets  Which go up every so often  But as long as I keep  Winning a few hands  And keeping even  And not really  Spending the pile  Paying for blinds  I wait for those good hands  And then hit them  Are you feeling comfortable?  Yeah  Much more than I was  When I sat down  Cameron's the one  That I've got to worry about  Wow that's crazy  Cameron Manheim  I know  Cameron Manheim is like  Taking pots off of 
[03:32:30]  Phil Gordon and shit  It's ridiculous  But that's the game  You know  You've got to wait  For the good cards  She's had some good ones  She's got some balls  She goes all in  You know  She calls bets  That are all in bets  Deacon Jones was one  Of the first people out  Was he?  After being all cocky  And wait till you listen  To the replay  Of this mess of a radio show  We had Ed Asner on  We had Ed Asner on  I saw Ed Asner  I was  Opie attacked Ed Asner  Guess who pissed him off?  You  No  Who?  Opie  Who else would piss him off?  Opie  Who else would say  That's the signal we get 
[03:33:00]  When our guest is being  Too boring  Who else would say that?  You did not  In front of a Hollywood legend  What did he say?  He wanted to kill me  He called me the destroyer  And when I said  I was getting a picture  Over there  And we sold Ope  Down the river  What a creep he is  And how we love  Mary Tyler  And I'm getting a picture  With him  I'm like  I just love your work  And he goes  Oh you guys are great  Get rid of that  Fucking wasp  Very good  Listen on the replay  It was very uncomfortable  You don't have to listen  To this show  And then you're interviewing  People  It's fun  Yeah 
[03:33:30]  People coming out  With card players  And stuff  Coming over  The one guy  I don't know who he was  But he's like  I saw him  Over here  Yeah that dude  We don't know  None of us know  Was he cool though?  He was real cool  Real cool  Smart guy  The only one  Who didn't fall  For Norton's shit  Yeah good  Yeah I'm asking  One of my questions  He's like  What are you talking about?  That's very funny man  It was awesome  He was a slick character  I think I made  Four and a half million  Last year  Four and a half mil  Man playing  Friggin poker  The problem is  We're wrecking Norton's gag  Because we can't stop  Lennon  Uh oh  Here she is  Here she is  You're the killer 
[03:34:00]  Have you been watching?  Yeah  No Anthony's at your table  This is my show  So I'm playing with you  And I'm telling him  How you're tearing it up  That's right I am  You should be afraid  Be very afraid  I know I'm still playing  So I'm not going to get  Any real strategy out of you  But is this a lot of skill  Or are you getting good cards out there?  Here's the deal  Yeah  I have a date tonight  So I don't give a shit  Oh really?  That's the only way  It's the way to get an audition  So you're just playing like  It's when you want a part  You kind of not care  Yeah  And when you're playing with the pros  You got to not care  You're taking hands off of pros out there 
[03:34:30]  Like you're one of the pros  I don't know  I don't know  Something's hitting today  Yeah  It doesn't make any sense to me  Obviously  I have been studying  I've been watching the pros  Yep  I've been watching the  Everybody on television  TiVo-ing all the poker channels  And reading some books  So you're surprised?  You seem to be like a buddy  I am a little surprised  I'm surprised I'm doing so well  You seem to be a little palsy  With Phil Gordon  What's going on there?  Well what happened was  This is sad  And I can't believe I'm repeating it 
[03:35:00]  Because it is very detrimental  To my career  But I was playing on the  Celebrity Poker Showdown  And one of my strategies was  I wasn't going to keep looking  At my cards  Because I think it's a sign of weakness  Right  That you can't remember  Two goddamn cards, right?  Yeah  So I had a king and a seven  A king of hearts  And a seven of some  Offsuit  And you know  The flop comes off  King of diamonds  You know  Four of diamonds  Three of diamonds  And I'm thinking  Oh my god  I got this pair of kings  And he's betting  My opponent's betting and betting 
[03:35:30]  And I'm thinking  He's got the flush  And I keep asking him  Do you got the flush?  Just tell me if you have the flush  Tell me now  This is a friendly game  Just tell me if you have the flush  And he's like  I don't have the flush  I promise  And I'm like  He's got a straight  That's what he has  He has a straight  And so  Even though I have these great kings  I fold my hand  He shows me his straight  And I'm like  Great  Great call on my part  Then I watch it  On TV  And that king in the hall  Was a king of diamonds  And I had the king high flush  So Phil  Has just been  Kicking my ass all day  About how I folded 
[03:36:00]  A king high flush  To a straight  Anthony's got to go back  We've got to go back  We've got to go back  I've got to go get all of Anthony's money now  Here we go  Here we go  I'm kicking ass  All right Anthony  We're going to have to find out  How Anthony does tomorrow  On the program  It's a very good  It's a cliffhanger  He's such a sick fuck  Look at him  That face  God damn  Was that her B.O.?  I don't know  I didn't smell it  Oh man  That was awful  Really? 
[03:36:30]  Absolutely awful  I didn't want to say anything  Because Anthony would kill me  Because they're at the same table  I was dying to go for that  Really?  I was dying to go for that  That's Jim  Jim  Now they're  Hold on  Get her on mic  Wow  Wow  She loves Jim's comedy  She loves your comedy Jim  Is that what she was saying?  No she didn't say both  Yeah she did like Rich too  Oh she did like you too  That's good  The one celebrity that recognized him  He looks like Cass Elliot  OP said she had B.O. 
[03:37:00]  Did she have B.O.?  Anyone else smell the B.O.?  Did not notice it  And I didn't want to do that to Anthony  Because he would kill me  Because they're at the same table  That would have been an easy target  First of all  She recognized me  She was nice  I would never say anything bad about her  Who would smell the B.O.?  Who cares?  He's under a lot of pressure  Playing black  Poker  Poker  What did Romano say?  I saw you talking to Ray Romano  Ray said  If you lose  Do you have to come over here  I go yeah  He goes  Well that will give me more incentive to win  Brad Garrett  We saw him walk by  Yeah  We've got a lot of the big stars though 
[03:37:30]  Who haven't we gotten  Besides Macaulay Culkin Ken?  We did pretty well today  I'm trying to get that little creep  What about Deacon Jones?  We've got to end the show with Deacon  We only have like 4 or 5 minutes left in the show  He's probably doing an episode of Cops right now  He's that hammered?  Yeah  He's on the patio  Is he?  He's out of his mind  Alright what were you going to say?  No I tried to get Brad Garrett and Ray Romano  But they wanted to go to the bathroom instead 
[03:38:00]  Okay  Alright they're getting  So you couldn't get Romano or Brad Garrett?  Nah  Alright  I'm trying though  Maybe we'll eat later  Have something with Parmesan cheese on it  Alright thanks  I am hungry  Alright well  You and your wrong word  Egg sense  While I was ahead on that one  They have begun dealing the cards again  Fourth time's the charm  Anthony's back in  What are we going to do tonight?  You're going to direct the porno right?  I'm probably going to direct the porno  The golden shower thing  Joe's going to either beat someone up  Or float somewhere 
[03:38:30]  Do a little floating right?  Woody  I think Master Poe's going to come to  My buddy's jiu-jitsu class  Oh really?  Yeah  I'm going to come train with Master Poe  I think I want to hit the comedy store tonight  Is it good night?  Wednesday night over there?  Sometimes  It all depends  Has Pryor been in there at all Joe?  Or no?  All the time  No  You know when I first started doing the comedy store  When I was there for like a couple of years  I used to have to follow him  And he's one of my heroes  Just like you  Yeah yeah yeah  You know he's totally one of my heroes  I mean I remember when I was a kid  The first time I ever thought about doing stand-up  I saw live in the Sunset Strip  In the movie theater  And I remember being in the movie theater 
[03:39:00]  Thinking  I have never seen a fucking movie  That's this funny before  And it's just a guy talking  And the whole movie theater  Was just falling out laughing  So to see him you know  In a wheelchair  It's so hard to watch  Although if life was fair  He would have died in 1974  The way he was doing dope  And dry  I figured he'd be on borrowed time  For 30 years anyway  The way he partied  So  Yeah no absolutely  Well one of these celebrity shows  Showed him on a movie set or something  Where he's not even talking anymore  Yeah his jaw is wide open  That killed me  Absolutely killed me  They say he's alive inside  They always say that  About Muhammad Ali too 
[03:39:30]  Oh you look inside his eyes  He's alive in there  Like what the fuck are you talking about  Yeah he's totally with it  He just can't communicate anymore  Yeah  Great  That's how I want to be  It's amazing that you see a guy like Ali especially  And that nobody just goes  Hey you know  Maybe people shouldn't be punching each other in the head  This is perfect  This is perfect  He's drunk now too  What happened Deacon  Well I came back because  You know the guy came  But it looks kind of bad  But the girl came  And I you know

[03:40:30]  If a guy has a big hand  You're looking at your thing  Sometimes you just got to go  You know what  I mean whatever  You know  Well you know  Unless you are one of those people  Who can tell  Who can look somebody in the eye  And tell what they got  Under them cards  What is your betting  You're betting on your hand  Okay  If you're bluffing  If you're bluffing  You're bluffing simply because  You think you got a higher hand  Than he has  Yeah  You know not necessarily a pair  Should you be giving us advice  At this point though  No  Aren't you the first one out  I don't give nobody advice  When I'm the first guy out
