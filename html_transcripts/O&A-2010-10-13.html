<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of the mainstream media's coverage of the Chilean mining rescue. Opie and Anthony repeatedly mocked the perceived melodrama, focusing on crude jokes about the miners' bodily functions, potential sexual activity underground, and their imagined post-rescue media gimmicks (e.g., emerging naked). They compared the miners' post-rescue health concerns to MRI machines and other uncomfortable situations. Kenny, a frequent listener, was mentioned as having watched the entire rescue overnight, and a caller, Greg from D.C., shared a rumor about Kenny being hired by the Chilean government to deliver death notices.  The hosts also derided *Teen Mom* and Jesse Ventura's appearance on Larry King Live, focusing on Ventura's conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination and Lyme disease.  This segment also included a pre-recorded "Under the Gun" roast of Sam Roberts, filled with vulgar insults.

Following a break, the show discussed a possible Chris Robinson (The Black Crowes) sighting on Jimmy Norton’s flight to Los Angeles, followed by satirical commentary on Jimmy’s appearance on Jay Leno. Jim Norton joined as a guest co-host. A thank-you letter from a former intern, Dustin, prompted further raunchy jokes.  The hosts then discussed a hockey player's obscene gesture and related videos, followed by vulgar commentary on a band's freeway shutdown publicity stunt.  Further discussion of the rescued miners was interspersed with personal anecdotes involving Sam’s family and a promotion for "Jocktober," a segment critiquing a Roanoke, Virginia radio show.  The hosts debated their handling of a tweet about Seth Green's wife's nude photos, readily available online.  The segment also included discussion of Gavin Rosdale’s admission of a past gay affair and the hockey player's fine.

The next segment began with a discussion about changing trick-or-treating time, quickly transitioning to a lengthy discussion of a 1976 Paul Lynde Halloween special, including speculation about Lynde's death and sexuality.  Audio clips from the special were played. Monica, a female friend, made brief, largely unintelligible contributions.  The hosts then made sexually graphic jokes about Lady Gaga's perfume, "Monster," and responded to a listener expressing disbelief in the show's legitimacy.  Further sexually explicit jokes followed a discussion of George Michael's release from prison and past legal troubles.  A caller claimed to have solved the JFK assassination.  The show then shifted to a discussion about Coca-Cola in glass bottles, featuring vulgar and sexually suggestive jokes and a story about a grandmother hoarding glass Coke bottles.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a "Hoarders" episode featuring a Darth Tater toy, a listener call, comments on Marlo Thomas's aging, a caller's anxiety over NYC imagery in TV intros, and a call from Bob Saget. Saget recounted a plane ride incident involving cowbells and unruly children, and discussed his upcoming stand-up shows and a new A&E series.

The final segment featured Bob Saget as a guest. He discussed his new A&E show about Hunter S. Thompson, his difficulties opening a Coke bottle, and uniquely-designed Asian soda bottles.  He recounted stories of less-than-ideal performance venues, including graphic descriptions of unattractive strippers and a particularly unattractive political candidate.  Further off-color discussions of sexual anatomy and bodily functions followed.  The conversation shifted to Jim Norton’s upcoming appearances at Foxwoods, including details about his accommodations and expectations of debauchery.  Norton shared a story about comedian Dice at a steakhouse.  The segment included discussions of Saget’s upcoming weddings, Norton's appearances on "The Metal Show," and humorous anecdotes about the "Jaegermeister Music Tour" featuring Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer, which included flying beer bottles and disgruntled audience members.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Are you watching this minor shit?  Oh, I can't get enough. 
[00:01:00]  This is when.  I can't get enough.  This is when mainstream media, because I guess we are part of the media, technically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is when mainstream media shows that they're completely retarded.  That they're completely retarded.  Oh, I thought you meant the barely legal site.  Oh, the minor stuff.  Oh, minor.  Oh, no.  See, I figured I'd get that joke out of the way immediately.  Now everyone can leave it alone.  Be more funny.  This is going great. 
[00:01:30]  Because obviously we get the joke.  We know.  Okay, terrific.  I was only joking.  That's funny.  Funny.  I'm funny.  Actually, it's a good line.  That's funny.  This is when the media shows that they're just completely retarded.  Yeah.  Because you've got a lot of these newsreaders.  They're just newsreaders.  They certainly are.  And all of a sudden they have to go off script.  Like, oh my God, we're going live for 48 straight hours.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I might have to say something. 
[00:02:00]  I might have to think of something to say.  Yeah, because it's a story that's unfolding over hours and hours and days.  What have we heard?  We've only been watching The Rescue for the last 10 minutes.  Because I decided, you know what?  I'm going to go to bed.  Yeah.  This is going to take three fucking days to get these fucks out of a hole.  They got eight of them up.  Eight and how many are down there again?  60 or something?  I think there's 125 or 30.  Right, right.  They just rescued one minor and the newsreader that had a think on her feet. 
[00:02:30]  She goes, he's on a cell phone.  Yeah, yeah.  He's on a cell phone.  Look, he's on a cell phone.  It's like, wow, yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  He might want to call some people.  Maybe there's some people to call.  And maybe it's not 1980.  Right.  He's like on a phone without a wire.  It's a miracle.  You're not going to believe this.  He's calling his mom.  I mean, obviously, there's not a lot of people around here.  Because every time they rescue a minor, you hear like a little...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You hear the same sound we heard at our last live broadcast. 
[00:03:00]  Anyway.  It's like the Jerry Lewis telethon, though.  You want to be one of them primetime guys.  Of course you do.  You don't want to be the guy that goes on at fucking three in the morning.  Right.  You want to be Paul Anka.  Yeah.  You know?  You want to get up there when the crowds are there.  And they're also announcing these minors like they're announcing the starting lineup for  the next Super Bowl.  Yeah.  The next minor to be rescued is the oldest minor down in the hole.  He's 63 years old. 
[00:03:30]  His name is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's take a look at his stats.  He's been mining since he was 20 years old.  And he is actually in the majors as far as minors go.  Right.  What?  Did you say that?  It's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  That little contraption they made, though, pretty impressive.  I always just think of Chili as those commercials where you got to give money for the little kids.  Oh, yeah.  They look like, you know.  The hair-lipped kids?  Yeah, the hair-lipped kids.  Is it the hair-lipped kids? 
[00:04:00]  And then the little kids that are wearing, like, the derbies.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, the kids that are wearing the derbies, and they're living in those huts by the water.  That just looks really fucking bad and shit.  Llamas?  Yeah, some llamas.  Llamas down there.  Things like that.  We should learn about Chili today.  Well, I think I've learned, like, wow, they could kind of figure out how to dig a pretty deep fucking hole  and put a torpedo in it and get them Chili-ians in there.  How deep could it be?  20, 25 feet?  Come on.  I hear it's about 30, 40 feet.  30 or 40 feet?  Wow.  Very, very deep.  Very deep hole. 
[00:04:30]  And Kenny's been watching all night.  We should get Kenny in here.  Oh, boy.  What is with Kenny?  This is the type of TV he loves.  He's waiting for a disaster so he can go, did you hear what happened?  Any type of TV where it goes at a snail's pace, he loves.  I'm like, it's going to take how long for the time to get out of here?  I'm going to bed.  But Kenny says it's like being in an MRI machine.  Oh, really?  Very claustrophobic.  You said it, too.  I thought you got out and the doctor told you, like, your cartilage was bad in your knee. 
[00:05:00]  It's exactly like an MRI machine.  Boy, that's claustrophobic, man.  You get into that little tube and what?  You just got to...  You can't move, really.  Yeah, you're like, you're just fucking hands at your side.  You can't move.  It takes 15 minutes, I guess, to get up, to get up through the hole.  They pull you up at a pretty quick clip.  They sure do.  It's about, I think they said 2,000 feet.  2,000 feet.  2,000 feet down. 
[00:05:30]  So that's...  Not in a straight line either.  Oh, really?  They're kind of going on the side, and then it makes a turn.  Oh, very cool.  It's like the fucking wacky elevator Bugs Bunny used to take up to the surface.  Well, it's about time we have elevators like that.  When I was a kid, I'm like, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I want the wacky elevators.  Wacky Vader.  Get me right to my desk.  Kevin from Connecticut.  They just rescued.  Ready for this, Anthony?  Yes.  Kenny fucking Powers.  Wow.  Thank God they got him out of there.  All I can think of also is how the stench that's got to be coming out of that fucking hole. 
[00:06:00]  Sure.  You got about 33 miners down there.  Sure.  They've been down there for a couple of months.  There's no showers down there.  They were rationing water and everything.  It's not like they had water to, you know, maybe, yeah, I'm going to take a nice long shower.  Is that okay with you guys?  Sure.  Well, yeah.  And where are they dumping?  Another thing.  This is what the newsreaders could get into.  Where are they dumping? 
[00:06:30]  Now, I think they were able to get down.  There's a couple of levels.  They went up to, like, the highest level they could before one of the cave-ins were there.  Okay.  So they probably had to walk down a little further for the dump.  Right.  To take the...  But 33 guys, two months worth of dumps.  Oh, boy.  That must be a giant pile of fucking miner, Chilean miner dump.  They better have a leader down there.  Yeah.  Because if they don't have some kind of leader, you know everyone is just dumping willy-nilly.  Oh, everywhere.  They need someone to yell.  It's everywhere.  No.  No. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Set up a dump area.  Kenny, you have any facts on the rescue?  Because you were watching all night.  Mierda.  What is it?  What?  Mierda.  Mierda.  No mierda.  What's mierda?  Shit.  Oh.  Nice.  No mierda aquí.  Nice.  Kenny, what do you got on the big rescue?  I only have hearsay, G.A.  Hearsay?  We like hearsays.  Well, we know you're not in Chile talking to the people directly.  Unless that guy was on the cell phone to you. 
[00:07:30]  No.  Do you understand espanol?  What do you got on the hearsay?  Mi poquito.  Mi poquito.  Ethan, no.  You big goon.  Look at you.  You giant.  So what do you got as far as hearsay goes?  I just heard, like, two things that, you know, like, at the rescue site, like, people  are gathering to, like, pray and, like, cheer on or whatever.  And, like, one guy had his wife and his girlfriend there. 
[00:08:00]  Oops.  And, like, they found out they were there for the same guy.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's not too good.  That happened when I was living in Huntington.  Yep.  You didn't have to be deep in a hole for that shit to happen, right?  It helped.  Actually, you were deep in a hole.  What am I saying?  Of course you were.  Yes, it helped a lot.  But what else you got as hearsay?  And the second thing I heard is that they're all fighting who's going to be the last person  out.  Well, because that's going to be the famous guy. 
[00:08:30]  That's the stupidest guy.  The 63-year-old that they're going to pull out next, who cares about him in the end?  It's going to be all about the last guy.  The last guy out.  That's going to be the picture on Time Magazine.  That's the record, by the way, of the person that's been down in a mine disaster the longest  before being rescued will be this guy.  Right.  The last guy.  So they want, you know, who doesn't want to be that guy?  The first guy, I think, and the last guy.  In between guys?  You're just in between guys.  Yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't they just, like, kind of cover up the hole and just kind of walk away? 
[00:09:00]  We've got enough people on this planet.  Holy shit.  That's, as a matter of fact, though, that's what the Chinese and the Russians do.  Oh, really?  Yeah, this is pretty fucking amazing that they're actually rescuing miners.  Because when a mine collapse happens in China, they just like, oh, yeah, everything good  here.  It's kind of like, yeah.  It's like everything, and they just bury them, fuck it.  I picture that scene from Caddyshack when Bill Murray puts the golf bag down after the  lightning strike and just kind of saunters off, like, I don't think anyone's going to  notice.  Look around. 
[00:09:30]  Hopefully no one saw.  That's what these guys do.  They bury up the hole and just kind of saunter off.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Opie brought up a point that they have to be taken on a 10-minute helicopter ride  to a medical center.  And I said, how funny would it be if the helicopter crashed?  Oh, shit.  How great would that be?  That would prove, by the way, there is a God, because then God could yell and scream,  look, I wanted these people dead, I told you.  I was trying to kill them.  You guys got in the way.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  Ah!  Did you talk about being in that little tube, being hoisted out?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I made your MRI comment, but maybe you could do better with that for me.  The giant dildo.  Looks like they're in a big dildo.  I look at it as a tampon.  A tampon?  A little tampon they're pulling out.  Going down there, pulling out some Chileans.  They should goof on the last guy, since they were all fighting to be last.  And go like, ha, ha, ha.  Like, stop it halfway and go, uh-oh.  Twilight's on there.  Uh-oh.  We can't get it out.  Yeah, just leave you down there.  Halfway up, so you're totally... 
[00:10:30]  You've got to do the math.  You've got to be saved in prime time.  It's kind of like when you have a good tweet.  You don't do it in the middle of the night.  You kind of wait and go, you know what?  A lot of people on their phones right about now, I'm going to send out my best tweet of the day.  Same with this minor shit.  You do your math down there and go, wait, I think I've got to be...  What time is it?  I've got to...  All right.  I think I can make the 6 o'clock news if I'm the 10th guy rescued.  And then, yeah.  The 12th guy rescued.  Yeah, you want prime time.  Yeah.  Who's this lunatic?  Psychological damage done by being underground for so long. 
[00:11:00]  This is Rashad just a while ago as one of the miners emerged.  A total of eight.  Psychological damage.  I dream for this shit.  You've got a story to tell for the rest of your life.  What's the psychological damage?  They've spent two months, 33 guys, and what amounts to the man cave.  All right, well.  They're hanging out in the man cave.  You think everyone was blowing each other, thinking they were going to die? 
[00:11:30]  Could you imagine that shit?  It's like, look, we've got to get off here.  I don't want to do this.  It's not gay if you're running out of air.  Yes.  We're going to die, and I really would like some sexual contact.  You think it's very awkward above ground now because they all know what's really going on down there?  They all look at each other.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  I thought I was going to die, man.  You know, we did some things down there we really don't want to talk about. 
[00:12:00]  It was to stay alive.  What, like food rationing?  What are you talking about?  Nah, I blew like ten guys.  All right?  All right?  I really thought it was my last day on earth.  Fuck.  Ah, shit.  How funny would that be?  That would be fucked.  Hey, man.  I don't want to come up.  You do some crazy shit if you think you're going to die.  Remember that crash where they were eating each other?  Alive, yes. 
[00:12:30]  They didn't think they were actually going to live past that.  No.  They were hoping, but I mean, realistically, they thought they were all going to die.  Yeah, they were eating people to stay alive.  Now those guys have to walk around knowing they fucking ate their pals to survive.  You know what it is, though?  It's not even that you ate your pals to survive.  It's the last bit of human meat you ate right before the chopper came.  Yeah.  And he went like, I didn't have to eat that.  Oh, that is a good point.  That didn't help me live because they got fucking burgers up there or some shit. 
[00:13:00]  The calf that you digested two days earlier.  Yeah.  Of course you needed that.  Yeah, yeah.  But I could have held off a little bit.  But the big piece of ass meat right as the helicopter's landing was a little too much.  You're still chewing, and when you're hearing, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.  Yeah.  Oh, those rotor blades.  Oh, fuck.  I see a glimmer of like a windshield.  You're chewing on a scrotum like it's beef jerky.  It's the last thing that's left.  Right.  The last part is you pop a ball in your mouth, a frozen nut in your mouth. 
[00:13:30]  You think the owner of this mine is going to dock these guys' pay and shit?  For napping on the job.  Take away all their vacation time.  Yeah.  Their sick days.  They weren't doing any mining.  How does that shit work?  I don't know.  Does Sirius own them?  Yeah.  That's true.  These miners being underground for 69 days and then being rescued today as we're watching  the rescue effort underway.  And we can tell you, from what we've seen so far, Dr. Suttonaprik joins us.  Doctor, they appear on the surface to be healthy.  In fact, they're pumped up. 
[00:14:00]  They're great.  They're waving their hands.  They appear to be.  But appearances obviously can be deceiving.  Yeah.  I know.  They're almost celebrating down there, which is great.  Oh, yeah.  There are a lot of physical concerns for them.  You think about my biggest concern, and what's amazing to me, is the concept of having a panic  attack that more of them have.  You think about if you've ever had an MRI.  They're minors.  They're not going to have panic attacks.  They're dudes.  They're fucking, and they're minors.  It's not like somebody that works in an office is put in a tube that's barely as big as you  are and dragged 2,000 feet underground. 
[00:14:30]  Decompression sickness, nausea, muscle cramps, blood clots, vitamin D deficiency.  What are they all having their periods?  That's what it sounds like.  They need a little fucking mitle.  They need a little water.  That's all.  Uh, but they're used, they're minors.  They're used to being in enclosed places, underground.  They, I don't understand what this is.  The excitement, anxiety, the excitement that you're fucking going to be rescued has got 
[00:15:00]  to be bigger than the, uh, the anxiety.  And they knew they were going to be rescued, what?  A while ago, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They fucking told them, look at, everyone's coming up with these fucking Roy Orbison glasses  on, though.  I guess they don't want the, the light hurting their eyes.  Imagine.  There's a big spotlight waiting for them.  The second they come out, you put a Klieg light on their face.  Watch them scream.  The joke's on you.  Wow.  Panic attacks, uh, psychological post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep cycle disruption, and 
[00:15:30]  depression.  That's everything morning radio gives you, by the way.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Yes, Sam.  Wow.  What do you got there, Sam?  Uh, sorry, my eyes aren't what they used to be.  Um.  What?  That's our pad data.  Oh, no.  What does the pad data say?  Minors rescue.  Minors?  Yeah, the, the, the, the young, young people are being rescued on our, on our fucking pad  data.  Aw. 
[00:16:00]  Minors.  Minors.  Oh, boy.  Who, who's responsible for that?  This is on the board today.  Oh, erec.  E.  E.  Whoops.  E-rec.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  That's good.  Oh, oh, this is very good.  Uh, let's say hi to Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Good morning.  B-b-b-boy.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes.  Yes.  Can you hear me?  Yes, speak.  Greg, come on, man.  Let's go.  Speak.  I apologize. 
[00:16:30]  Gentlemen, I heard on CNN this morning that Kenny has actually been employed by the Chilean government to give out the death notices.  Hola, mi amo es Kenny.  Cruz esposo es muerto.  Adios.  He would love the job.  I love the adios.  He would love the fucking job.  Anyone die down there?  Nah.  Wow, this is pretty impressive. 
[00:17:00]  They all pulled through.  Oh, now they're talking with one of them?  Where?  Oh, that's on that station.  We can't get that station.  He's still wearing the...  They're wearing the glasses.  The Ray Charles glasses.  It's Ray Charles...  Stevie Wonder.  Stevie Wonder glasses.  And the old black blues musician.  Mario Sapulvida.  Oh, they named a boulevard after him in California.  Wah-ha-ha.  Rescued Chilean minor.  I'm not minor. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, what are they?  25 left?  25 left down there.  So that's going to take days.  Yeah, that's what they said.  It's going to take quite a while.  Not days.  Maybe two days at this point.  Yeah, it takes 15 minutes up, 15 minutes down, but it does...  They do have some fucking, you know, in-between time.  Can you imagine you're the last guy?  Yeah.  This is talking to the people that get freaked out by stuff.  You're the last guy, right?  And all of a sudden you realize the capsule's going away for the last time because they 
[00:18:00]  think they got everybody.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Wow.  The lights go out.  Couldn't you climb out of that hole, though?  That would be a hell of a climb.  What would you do?  You can't do it with your hands?  What are you, Spider-Man?  What the fuck?  Why not?  You would need some...  I don't think being underground for two months on rations, you would have the strength  to crawl 2,000 feet up a tube.  They had food down there?  Very smoothly.  I like tuna.  They used, like...  They rationed out a couple little ounces of tuna and some water.  What if guy...  Like a half a cup of water a day. 
[00:18:30]  So you need a leader down there.  Oh, yeah.  No leader.  And you know everyone's just...  Anarchy.  Eating, feasting.  I'm sure it was just like the movies where there's the one asshole guy, the one guy  that's trying to be the leader.  Where the other guy that's just saying, fuck it, we're all doomed.  You know.  You think there were two camps and it's kind of like the Poseidon Adventure?  No, you're going the wrong way.  Or fucking...  They bump into the others like Lost.  Oh, very good.  Oh, that'd be good.  A whole story's made.  I see movie, though. 
[00:19:00]  I see movie.  No one's going to watch this movie.  It's going to have to have subtitles.  Who's going to watch a movie with subtitles?  Nah, like Alive.  Alive, they just figured, fuck it.  And make believe they all spoke English?  Let's put Ethan Hawke in it.  Yeah, that's true.  Was he in that?  We're pompous assholes.  We're just like, make it our movie.  Fuck it.  Yeah, fuck everyone else.  We speak English, so make them all speak English now.  Make it our movie.  There's another movie.  Oh, coal miners covered.  You rules.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, there was that other movie about the submarine that got the Enigma machine.  Old school? 
[00:19:30]  Gray Lady Down?  No, no, no.  It was a relatively new one.  Oh, okay.  A number.  Something like that.  It'll pop up, I'm sure.  Oh.  You 571?  Okay.  And it was English.  There were English guys that got that.  And then they fucking put fucking Americans in there.  And yeah, we did it.  Well, good news, Anthony.  While we went to bed, Bill the trucker stayed up all night to watch this horseshit. 
[00:20:00]  Bill, what do you got, buddy?  No, I didn't stay up all night to watch the horseshit.  Oh, you've been up all night?  Yeah, I drive on the road all night.  I've been listening.  They were trapped for 17 days before they found them and had to survive on like a couple cans of peaches and tuna fish.  Peaches are delicious.  Yeah, I would eat peaches all night.  I'd eat peaches all day if I had to.  Imagine the shits coming out of them, though.  No kidding.  Canned peaches and tuna. 
[00:20:30]  This guy looks very, very energetic.  It looks like he was well-fed down there.  He's fine.  What the fuck do they have down there?  A restaurant?  He's leading a chant.  Holy shit.  After 17 days, they had a supply line going down to them.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, so they were sending notes and they were signing souvenirs weeks ago and sending them up.  If I was down there, I would suffocate everyone in their sleep so I'm the last survivor.  Like, I don't know what happened out here, man. 
[00:21:00]  It must have been a gas leak.  Oh, the farts.  You never want to be one of many in this situation.  No, you want to be the only guy.  You want to be one of few.  Well, they set up a virtual village.  They're saying that the last one coming out is going to be the foreman who was kind of running the whole show.  That kind of fucked up this whole thing.  That's good.  The guy that caused the cave-in?  Yeah, great.  Exactly right.  The guy that caused the chaos to begin with is to be the hero at the end.  And the mining company that owned the mine went out of business two days after the collapse. 
[00:21:30]  Whoops.  They just backed it up and left.  No pay for that.  Oh, my God.  What a wreck that is.  Oh, the yellow sheets are out.  Oh, boy.  You never want to see yellow sheets.  This is what sucks about doing morning radio.  We talk about this a lot.  And maybe we should do this break later in the morning.  But every morning, you see where all the drunk drivers fucking crashed and died.  They never talk about this later on in the day.  Every morning, there's some horrific crash they're cleaning up for the commuters. 
[00:22:00]  I almost got wiped out this morning.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding you.  It's all drunks out there.  We've been in two fender benders, and I live five minutes from this damn joint.  I was on the expressway right before fucking Van Damme Street there.  And I'm boogying down the left lane.  A guy goes from the middle lane, and I mean comes over on me.  Not in front of me.  I'm right next to him.  And he starts coming over right on me.  Yeah.  I had to jam on the fucking brakes, and I was doing like 80.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  And then he just gets in front of me, passes a car, and goes back in his lane like nothing happened.  And all I saw from behind when he was in front of me was a yarmulke on the back of his head.  Oh, boy.  The shit I was yelling out could have been used in a 1938 propaganda film.  But it doesn't count if you're saying it to yourself.  You've got to open that window.  And then get some things done.  No, no, no.  That's what I'm saying.  If it's in your own vehicle, what the fuck?  No one hears it. 
[00:23:00]  And the guy almost killed me, the motherfucker.  Yeah, that's scary out there.  Came right over on me.  I jammed on the brakes, had to do the little thing with the fucking wheel, because I started  going a little sideways.  Right.  And wow, as I'm mad.  I think 6 a.m. is the cutoff.  Most of the drunks are home at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  I get the tail end of the guys that really wanted to tie it on.  Right.  Went to the after hours club.  Right, exactly.  Fuck wad.  Hey, and we got some coal miners coverage.  Coal miners coverage. 
[00:23:30]  The weather in the mine is going to be dark and a little damp.  Because like we said, to start the show, hold on.  We've been waiting so long.  Fox 5's John Huddy has been monitoring the events as they unfold this morning.  He is in the Fox 5 web room with more.  Good morning, John.  Good morning.  Well, actually, I'm still in the newsroom.  I'll be in the web room in about 30 minutes.  Okay.  We're talking about, let me show you real quick the headlines already.  This is in the New York Post.  The first miner miracle. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know if you could see that.  This was the second miner, Mario Sepulveda, to be brought up.  He's already being called a rock star because after getting out of the capsule,  he led the crowd in cheers after embracing, obviously, family and friends.  You've got to have a gimmick to be rescued.  He's famous.  He handed out rocks, if you can believe it, to some of his rescuers.  Very exciting.  The ninth miner who we're waiting on is also the oldest one in the groups.  Isn't this unbelievable?  Dude, he's the famous one because he got a gimmick.  Yeah, you've got to have a gimmick.  Oh, what do you do?  You come out completely naked. 
[00:24:30]  That would be...  You just come up with your big Chilean uncliffed cock hanging out.  Looking like an anteater's attached to you.  He's like, well, here's the...  And he's naked!  With a crowd is cheering, he's naked!  You can't just be the guy that comes up, gets out.  Why do these guys look like...  This guy looks like Ramirez was his name, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the serial killer.  The serial killer?  He looks like Ramirez.  Maybe we should have kept that one down there. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they all got mullets.  The first miner.  This is really emotional.  All of us even here in the newsroom...  It's not emotional.  It's only emotional for the...  I got a little choked up.  Why are you getting choked up?  You don't know these people.  As he reached the surface late last night, his son, who was breaking down in tears, and  then moments later, reuniting with his dad, bringing to an end the 69-day reveal for him.  Now, all of this started when 700,000 tons of rocks collapsed August 5th.  700,000 tons, sealing the men in the lower reaches of the gold...  Oh, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:25:30]  It's a gold mine?  Blah, blah, blah.  I'd have fucking been picking a few rocks up.  Nuggets up, right?  Yeah, a few nuggets, as they say.  Put some nuggets in your back pocket.  Well, Sam is all over the place, and the rest of the guys just trying to find these newsreaders.  Team coverage.  We have team coverage.  Well, it's different with us.  We like to expose the media for being completely retarded when they have to go live.  Morons.  Here we go.  And they...  There he goes. 
[00:26:00]  That's Claudio Yanez, again, stepping out, being helped by rescuers, embracing his wife.  34 years old, and apparently one of the things that happened while he was underground is that  his girlfriend, this could be her right here, sent down a note proposing to him.  We don't know if he accepted or not, but there he is in the arms of a loved one.  Something tells me that might be a yes there somewhere.  He obviously accepted, because if he wasn't going to accept, he would have just stayed down  in the ground.  Why don't you go next? 
[00:26:30]  I'm going to hang out down here for a little bit.  I think I'd rather live with the bats.  You sent a note down?  I didn't get a note?  I didn't see no note.  A note?  I didn't see a note.  Well, then you got another one here.  There are so many stories already that are unfolding.  You know, earlier we showed that first minor to be rescued, embracing his son.  Obviously, a very emotional scene.  These guys never expected, obviously, to be trapped down there for 69 days. 
[00:27:00]  And again...  This guy's on a cell phone, it looks like.  He's on a cell phone.  Yeah.  He's getting a call already.  It's like he's giving a throne a little peace on there, too.  And again...  Did you hear the newsreader?  He was so excited.  He's on a cell phone.  He's on a cell phone.  Can you believe it?  He's been stuck underground for two fucking three months, whatever it is.  And he comes up, and he's on a cell phone.  Cell phone, everybody.  Yeah.  That's how we communicate.  That would probably be the first thing every one of these guys wants to do, you idiots. 
[00:27:30]  Can I have a cell phone, please?  Right.  I think I have a few people I want to talk to.  Holy shit.  I didn't get cell service down there.  What an idiot.  He's on a cell phone.  Steve from Bayshore saying, there's a man in the water.  There's a man in the water.  It's the same shit.  Let's see what ABC did so far with this crap.  I can hear the cheers and the songs and the screams.  That's how we really know when something's about to happen, because they start chanting  and singing.  It's the most incredible thing. 
[00:28:00]  There's nothing incredible about that.  Wow, that's incredible.  Whose ass is that?  Is that Leanne Rimes' ass?  God damn, she looks good.  How does she look good?  I love how she's bent all the way over, and the headline is, Leanne Rimes will make a  great mom.  She's bent over at the waist, not one bend at the knee.  Right.  A great mom.  I wonder why that is.  Wow.  Look at this.  Is she good looking?  I don't even know.  Can we see her face?  She's a little wacky.  She is, right?  She's got a nice ass, though.  Yeah, you've got to give her that. 
[00:28:30]  So what were they saying here?  They're singing and stuff?  Because they start chanting and singing.  It's the most incredible thing, and everybody here has been glued to this rescue operation.  It doesn't matter whether it was the first man out, the eighth man out, or, of course,  the 33rd man out.  Everyone is sticking around, and they're so excited to welcome these men out of the darkness  and into the light and into the arms of their family.  It's chilly.  What else have they got to do?  And they're not sticking around for the middle people.  No, no.  It's kind of like when you watch a road race or the New York City Marathon. 
[00:29:00]  You're like, wow, there's the winner.  And then you watch a few more, and then about 10 minutes in, you're like, this guy is in  what?  328th place.  He gives a shit.  Let's go get a cup of coffee.  So you see the first few and the last guy.  All the guys in the middle are going to get fucked.  The guy throwing up the fucking gang signs when he came up to everybody, he's going to  be the most famous one, though.  The one that had the gimmick?  Yeah, he had the gimmick.  I like your thought that one of these guys should come out completely naked. 
[00:29:30]  Completely naked.  Just opening up their butt cheeks.  That's the first thing they see is him spreading his ass cheeks open.  He's in, like, backwards, so his ass is facing out the little grill.  Ah, shit.  And finally, Anthony, we're going to have more of these clips.  The news just doing what they do horribly.  Yeah.  Report.  TV.  Sony's sleek.  All right.  The CW thinks being in a small tube for 15 minutes is tough for people who just spent 
[00:30:00]  69 days trapped underground.  But just to give, I mean, you know, perspective as to this capsule and how wide the shaft was,  is it just as big as a wheel?  They were saying a...  Yeah, it's 28 inches wide.  In fact, I don't even think we should call it wide.  I think we should call it narrow.  Narrow, yes.  It's 28 inches wide.  That's my shoulders.  I'm not some huge guy here.  Wide shaft.  But, look, my shoulders are about 26 inches, I'm told. 
[00:30:30]  So add another two inches, that's it.  That's it.  And you're in that for 16 minutes, just standing there.  You slowly get lifted up, and, well, you can see there, that is the result.  What is the result?  Freedom?  Freedom.  Maybe you'll put up with fucking being in a confined spot if the end result is you're  free from a mind collapse.  Why is our coverage always better?  I don't know.  When it comes to these live events.  Is that it?  Are they loading in the other guy? 
[00:31:00]  Actually, we'll be moving on like a webcam down there.  That's right.  Yeah, you can see that capsule right there.  Are you digging the Kim Kardashian fucking pictures?  I'm not at all, man.  What, the silvery ones?  Usually when you get to see a girl naked, you're like, you're all in, but there's...  Don't paint her up.  I don't know, man.  What do you say we paint each other up, me and you, Paul?  I mean, the silver paint?  What do you think?  I'm not digging on the silver paint at all.  You're not, right?  If you're going to be naked, be naked.  Stop with the paint.  I don't like when girls paint tuxedos on themselves.  It's another...  It's like, oh, look, they're naked, but it's a tuxedo. 
[00:31:30]  It looks like a girl in a tight tuxedo.  It's another gimmick for a girl that doesn't have a brain.  Yeah.  These women that are famous for nothing.  Paint a tuxedo on themselves.  They have to do shit like this because they don't have a brain.  Huh?  One of the guys should paint a tuxedo on themselves.  Oh, that would be good.  Be naked, paint a tuxedo.  That would be wonderful.  You'd be the guy.  They all try to outdo themselves.  One guy should come up doing a headstand.  Just go, put me in the tube upside down.  Just do it. 
[00:32:00]  They're going to laugh their balls off when they see my feet come up first.  As he has a stroke halfway up.  Jesus Christ.  Enough of these minors.  Boy, are we fucking...  Boy, are we strapped for stories in the news, I guess.  Nothing happening here?  No, I understand it's a big story, but just how they report it is ridiculous.  I don't know how they're supposed to report it, I guess.  Let me say hi to Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Hi.  In Brooklyn.  Hey.  Anthony in Brooklyn.  What up?  Good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  I got a question.  What does Jesse Ventura think about this whole situation?  Obviously, government conspirators caused the collapse.  What reasons?  I don't know.  I'm not privy to that.  I tried to get into the mine, and I'm a former governor.  And they wouldn't let me in.  I was a fighter.  A Navy SEAL. 
[00:33:00]  I tried swimming through the rock to get to them, but they wouldn't allow me.  What an ass.  He was on Larry King last night.  Oh, God.  Why do you think I took that call?  It segs right into Larry King and Jesse Ventura talking last night.  His dismissive laugh is the best thing, where it's like, well, you can believe what you want.  I know I was on the inside.  It's like, what? 
[00:33:30]  He's quickly becoming a joke for everybody now.  He is a complete joke.  I think we were early on this one, but I think the masses are starting to go, what is up with this guy?  He will never do our show again, by the way.  We've tried.  We've tried to smooth things over a little bit.  Because he's scaredy-cat.  He's scared of Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton, who I believe is a guest on our show today.  Jimmy Norton will be a guest on our show.  We've got a guest.  Has that been confirmed?  Now that he's all about Hollywood, he got us a great fucking plug again last night on Leno. 
[00:34:00]  Again.  Again.  Again.  Yeah, he should be here within the hour for the first time in, I think, a month or so.  Yeah.  Been a while.  He was house hunting out there in L.A.  If you think those are the same miners that went down that are coming up, well, you can believe that.  Those people were killed, summarily killed, and imposters were put in their place from one of the flights from 9-11. 
[00:34:30]  What, Jesse?  Exactly.  What?  You know, it's not too far off.  Here's Jesse Ventura on Larry King last night.  Some of the highlights.  Are you enjoying doing that show, Jesse?  I really like it, Larry, because, first of all, I love to attack our government, you know?  I know.  It's an unending thing.  You get a tremendous amount of stories, and it keeps me vim and vigor, and, you know, I like to seek the truth.  And I think that my government's lied to me so often that this is a show that allows me to do that. 
[00:35:00]  Where is Plum Island?  Plum Island is...  He is the best.  Why does he have to retire?  Where is Plum Island?  I love plums when they turn them into prunes.  Where is...  Where is Plum Island?  This guy used to be a great interviewer, too.  People used to study Larry King's interviewing style.  Jesse...  And now he's just a dolt. 
[00:35:30]  Tell us about Plum Island.  Is it near Peach Peninsula?  Comment.  How's me to do that?  Where is Plum Island?  Plum Island is located right on the end of Long Island, and the unique thing about it is, Larry, it's a biological testing area that was created by a guy named Eric Traub, who was a Nazi right under Himmler and the SS.  Oh, sorry.  And his specialty was creating biological warfare using wood ticks and mosquitoes, and that's the big conspiracy here, because Lyme disease, the first recorded case was in Lyme, Connecticut, which is right across the water from Plum Island. 
[00:36:00]  And imagine this, they're doing this type of research there, this type of danger, and they're 80 miles from Boston and 75 miles from downtown New York.  The most populated area in our country, Larry.  Wow.  Larry's just like, hmm.  Wow.  By the way...  It's amazing. 
[00:36:30]  By the way, what a coincidence that Lyme disease started in Lyme, Connecticut.  Isn't that a coincidence?  Ba-dum-poosh.  That's weird when that happens.  By the way, online feed, fuck it up again for the boys down the hall.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Well, they asked me, well, let us know when it's happening so we can figure this out.  It's happening right the F now.  It's chemical, biological weapons.  A guy that was a Nazi actually started the... 
[00:37:00]  By the way, we brought over fucking Nazis after the war because they were brilliant fucking engineers and brilliant minds.  Scientists.  They were great scientists.  If it still came over, we wouldn't have a fucking space program if it wasn't for the German scientists that were brought over.  I like your thought, but you said, by the way, wrong.  By the way.  Hey, you got it.  Yes, Von Braun.  Von Braun was a German scientist. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  And?  Werner Von Braun.  All right, Jesse, shut up.  Fix your fucking radio, man.  People are getting mad.  Man!  Right in the middle of you talking about that guy getting, you know, cutting you off.  It went to something else.  See?  It's a conspiracy.  Yeah, they don't want you to hear the good stuff.  Larry.  Here's Jesse talking about the JFK conspiracy episode.  Is that what you're saying?  Well, I was just going to say they let me do JFK this year, Larry, and everybody asks me what I can bring new to the John F. Kennedy murder. 
[00:38:00]  How about an audio, visual, and written confession?  That's what you'll hear this year.  Ha, ha, ha, Jesse, shut up.  Wow.  Wow.  That's all Larry's saying.  Wow.  Wow.  Know what Larry's doing right there?  We all do it, too.  When you're in the middle of a conversation and you realize, holy shit, I don't know what this person was just saying to me.  He's a nut.  And they're looking at you for a reaction, so you say something like, wow, and hope that covers it? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  That's what Larry's doing there.  Well, written video confession on a show, right?  This is something that couldn't be uncovered through decades, decades of all kinds of conspiracy theories and everything, but it's going to be on Jesse's show.  Wow.  And who's confessing to what?  Wow.  I never said it was confessing to the JFK assassination. 
[00:39:00]  It's confessing to shoplifting baseball cards at the stationery.  What?  Wow.  Wow.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Jesse wants to abolish both political parties, and he's got cute nicknames for them, too.  The last clip from last night for now.  My view is we've got to get rid of both of these parties.  I now stand for the abolishment of the Democrats and Republicans.  Don't put them on ballots.  Just put names on there. 
[00:39:30]  But I don't imagine you're in favor of the Tea Party.  No, not really, because I think that they're just an extension of the Republicans.  Again, Larry, I don't support the third party movement anymore, because to me, the system is so corrupt that any third party that's going to enter and be competitive within this system is going to have to corrupt itself.  Well, it's already a two-headed monster.  Why would we need a three-headed monster?  Let's abolish political parties.  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams all stood for that, so I've got pretty good people standing behind me. 
[00:40:00]  I don't believe the Constitution mentions parties, does it?  I don't believe it does, either.  I think this is something that came later, and I like to refer to them as the Democrips and the Rebloodlicans, Larry.  And let's have no gangs in government.  Let's start cleaning out our government and the gangs that run it.  Rebloodlicans, Democrips, I think a third party would just become part of a three-headed monster, and that's the fourth show in my series. 
[00:40:30]  There's supposed to be one in the East River.  However, I'll be going to New York looking for the three-headed monster, Larry.  Who are you bringing with you?  Goldust?  Goldust is coming with me.  The blue meanie?  Any wrestler that's still alive. 
[00:41:00]  Look into that conspiracy, Jesse.  Why are the wrestlers dying at an alarming rate?  Oh, the sitch got kicked off dancing with the stars.  How did that happen?  Was he not good?  No, that sucks.  Back to the, what, mushroom?  I guess.  Is that what they call it?  The smush room?  Back to spreading his herpes.  Whatever the hell he's got.  You think he's got something?  I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  He's got a lot of action.  A lot of action.  He's got a lot of that action going on.  I haven't watched one episode of that God fucking show.  God bless you, man.  I don't know how you avoid it.  It's everywhere.  Yeah, and I was watching a little MTV last night.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was watching that Teen Mom.  I watched a little Teen Mom.  Oh, God.  That fucking couple, the Brace Face one and the other kid that gave the baby away.  Yeah.  Enough already.  It's infuriating.  Enough already.  I want to clunk their heads together, these dum-dums. 
[00:42:00]  Teen Mom rules.  And you know the fucking couple that adopted the baby is like, oh, fuck, these white trash  fucking idiots are coming to visit.  Right.  And they got the cameras rolling.  The cameras are going.  They're fucking snapping pictures.  You think they're regretting adopting that one?  Yes!  They could have adopted someone else's kid, and there wouldn't have been any cameras.  Never would have had that.  Or a whiny teenage couple.  Whiny teenage couple.  And they're like, well, she's got braces, so she's talking like this on her braces. 
[00:42:30]  We made a scrapbook for Carly, and I hope that someday she can look at it and know who  her parents were.  And that shit's right in the garbage, like fucking that Schmidt movie.  Yes.  That fucking, oh, this is beautiful.  This is beautiful.  Thank you so much.  Oh, Carly's going to enjoy this right in the dumpster.  She sounds a little like Lou Holtz from yesterday.  Like Lou Holtz. 
[00:43:00]  Teen Mom Lou Holtz.  She's one of those braces forever.  The kid looks like fucking Justin Bieber, and they're laying down like, you look and go,  they fucked?  How great would it be if they gave away a Justin Bieber?  They're dirt poor, white trash shit.  Yeah, and they gave away a fucking...  And they gave away their meal ticket.  A moneymaker.  That's why you kids, you can't give away your babies.  You never know.  You might have the next fucking Justin Bieber to take care of you for the rest of your  life.  All they do is sit there and think, I'm so happy we made the right decision. 
[00:43:30]  We made the right decision to give away our baby because we couldn't raise it.  Yeah, I know.  We couldn't really raise the baby.  That's the boy, by the way.  Like, yeah, we couldn't raise him.  Oh, it's good.  And she's with such a good family.  I know.  Did you see how happy she looks?  And you just sit there and go, shut up about it.  They got tattoos of the baby's name.  And you know, the couple is just like, how do we get this white trash couple out of our  lives?  You know, I don't... 
[00:44:00]  Why am I so angry?  I'm a few episodes behind.  Do they want the baby back?  No.  Or they just want to keep visiting it?  No, they want to keep visiting it.  Why aren't the new parents just saying, get the fuck away?  I don't know.  I guess they ought to sign something.  Maybe because MTV purposes, it just makes good TV.  Maybe.  But it was a year, I think, before they actually saw it again or something.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Ecstasy of Gold is now replaying for everybody that's listening online.  It's a great little song if you're online.  Sure.  The show just restarted. 
[00:44:30]  These guys can't figure it out, though.  They just can't figure out what's going on with the online feed.  I'd like to listen to it and see how we did.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I think we had a solid...  Why don't we do that?  I think we had a solid first hour.  Jesus Christ, man.  Solid.  Un-fucking-believable.  Yeah, so Teen Mom was good.  Yeah, Teen Mom, and then I watched the show on After It, which was You Don't Know Me or  Do You Know Me or Can You Get to Know Me or whatever the fuck it was.  Some high school, right, they have this challenge day, and what they do is they get a bunch of 
[00:45:00]  kids together in the auditorium or the gym or whatever the fuck it is, and they talk  to each other about bullying, and they had a jock, and they had a student council, and  they had a choir, a girl that was in choir, and they had an emo girl, and it was like  this total rip-off of Breakfast Club.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they tried to make it seem like that.  One of everything, whatever.  And the best was they had this girl, and she was a cute little kid. 
[00:45:30]  Like, it felt bad for her and shit.  She had, like, another one with braces and blonde hair.  And then the bully girls, they were following, like, the girl around with the camera, and  the bully girl started calling her Joe Dirt.  And she starts crying.  I'm roaring.  That's hilarious.  Roaring, laughing.  She goes, they call me Joe Dirt, and I just don't want to go to school anymore. 
[00:46:00]  I want to go back to high school, because I would do so much better defending myself  at this point.  I actually felt sorry for her.  I would rock the hallways.  It was so...  Oh, you do.  I would rock the hallways.  I think that sometimes it's like, you would be the fucking, just shit.  Oh, fuck yeah, I would be.  Like, shut.  Just turn around and go, shut the fuck up.  Oh, I would rock.  Is that supposed to bother me?  I took a lot of shit, like, just about everyone listening.  And then you got to sit there and go, like...  Not anymore now.  You skulk away sometimes.  It's just... 
[00:46:30]  Punch your locker, because you can't punch the person.  She talked about the time the popular kids took her, turned her upside down, and threw  her in a garbage pail.  I'm rolling.  I'm rolling.  I'm rolling.  It was great.  Why?  That's funny.  I'm sorry.  It is.  It's just funny.  I know it's wrong.  It is.  Because people ask me, you know, do I realize some of the things I do is wrong?  And I go, no, not really.  Because I'm doing it for entertainment purposes.  Yeah.  That's my excuse when I'm walking around in my real life. 
[00:47:00]  It's a job.  I know it's wrong, but it's also really fucking funny.  They had the class clown kid, and he shows up, and they talk to him beforehand, and he's  like, yeah, it's going to be whatever.  And he's like the first one to start.  My parents!  I never got the approval of this!  It's like, Jesus Christ, dude.  Calm down.  Let the fucking thing start already.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Good TV.  You know what?  It was great fucking just bullshit.  I went old school.  I'm trying to catch up with Always Sunny in Philadelphia, man.  That show is fucking great.  Yeah, it's a funny fucking show.  Third season, halfway through it.  That's a funny fucking show right there.  Is season four on DVD or on Netflix?  Because that's where I'm going to stop my watching.  Because I refuse to watch a new season until I'm caught up.  Four has been out for a while.  Five just came out a couple weeks ago.  Oh, wait.  They're up to six?  Yeah.  This is the sixth season.  Oh, so I've got to get four and five still. 
[00:48:00]  I'm pretty sure.  Yeah.  I think I'm right.  Damn.  Fuck.  Last night's episode was the white rap dude that they thought was retarded.  Oh, yeah.  That's one of my favorites.  That's one of my favorites.  And then they start a band and they're kind of like doing a little Dylan action.  A little sort of like Jethro Tull.  And then they decide to go with the 80s fucking weird band.  That's the Dayman episode.  Yeah.  With the Dayman lyrics.  What was the Dayman lyrics again?  Oh, wow.  Something about fucking martial arts.  Dayman.  Fighter of the Nightman.  Yeah.  Champion of the Sun.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, very good. 
[00:48:30]  Master of karate and friendship for everyone.  Everybody knows this.  There you go.  Very good.  Everybody knows this.  Fucking Danny knows.  Justin, I want to break in right now.  The Ninth of Mine of Mario Gomez has been rescued.  You know, everybody was concerned they haven't seen light for 69 days.  That's why he's wearing the sunglasses.  They have them all wearing sunglasses.  Oh, thank you for letting us know.  They're worried about their eyes.  Great moment for the world.  Particularly chilly.  They're very proud.  And everybody was concerned.  You know, there might be some anxiety issues.  Oh, right with the anxiety.  It's like a 45 minute or right up to the surface. 
[00:49:00]  45 minutes.  It's very confined.  The booth, a special capsule.  I think they call it the Phoenix Capsule.  And he'll be taken to the hospital, we believe, very soon.  All these guys have some issues.  And there may even be some post-traumatic stress to cope with.  But for now, celebrations and hope that...  They just got a vacation stop.  You want to talk about anxiety?  That's going to work every fucking day.  And how much of a rush were they in if they painted the capsule?  Oh, they did?  Yeah, there's like...  The flag is on it.  Oh, nice.  It says... 
[00:49:30]  It has the name on it.  They painted it like the Chilean colors and stuff.  Wouldn't you think it would just be like metal?  By the way, going with your gimmick?  Yeah.  63-year-old guy?  Had nothing, so...  He had nothing.  He's going to be nothing.  We're going to forget about him very quickly.  He held up a fucking Chilean flag that was signed by everybody.  Right in front of his face, dummy.  Yeah.  He doesn't know how to work this.  I guess he's hugging somebody, his daughter.  You don't hold the flag right in front of your face?  No, you wave it around.  You wave it around, make sure they get a picture of the flag and your face.  Not many people there right now. 
[00:50:00]  A little early in the morning.  It's a who-gives-a-shit moment for him.  We'll be following this all morning long at 7.02.  Oh, God!  Look what he came up to.  Is he making out with his foreman?  Holy shit.  Is that one of the Pointer sisters?  She is gruesome.  Wow, is she brutal.  Oh, who's the blonde, though?  Pretty spectacular images.  Yes, very impressive.  And, wow, just the whole thought.  What's he doing?  69 days down in the hole.  But that's coming to a close.  That's great news. 
[00:50:30]  Weather-wise, hey, we're looking pretty good out there.  Prep Burger!  30 days in the hole!  Oh, very good.  Get on it, boys.  Get on it.  Prep Burger.  Song parody.  Morning Radio needs your 30 days in a hole song parody.  Even though it was what?  How many days?  60, 70, 70.  You like that Humble Pie song?  No, not a big fan.  Of that song?  Yeah, not that fan.  Not a big fan of that song.  That's too bad.  He got on his knees.  I guess he was praying for a little while. 
[00:51:00]  Got up.  He's waving his arms.  He's trying to work it, but he's a middle.  He's a middle.  Yeah, he's not the fucking headliner.  This guy's not a headliner.  He's not the MC.  Nah.  He's just the middle that we all forget.  Why are you letting the 63-year-old up early?  Just in case this thing breaks down.  You know, you've got to save the young.  Yeah.  Leave the old guy down there.  He's 9 of 33.  He lived his life.  This story needs one glitch.  Well, that's why they're...  We need a glitch. 
[00:51:30]  That's why they're going live.  I know.  Do people realize that?  Exactly.  They're only going live hoping for the glitch.  Like one of these guys comes out dead, or the thing breaks...  Or the thing breaks down in the middle of one of the rescues.  That's the only fucking reason they're going live with this all morning.  For the glitch.  You're right.  What was the Arnold movie with the fucking game show?  Running Man.  Running Man.  Right.  Running Man.  The cable snaps.  You turn into fucking Running Man.  Just plummeting through that pipe in that little fucking tube. 
[00:52:00]  Tron.  A little Tron action.  Or it could be some Tron action.  A little Tron.  They lay the old guy down in a stretcher.  They're giving him some oxygen.  Covering him with a little fucking horse blanket.  Yeah.  That has fleas.  I'm sure.  Now he'll go to one of the worst hospitals in the world, probably.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  He's probably going, Estados Unidos, por favor.  All of a sudden, they're just amputating his limbs.  Yeah.  For no reason.  No real reason.  Si. 
[00:52:30]  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  Yes.  I got to eat.  Watching these miners that have been down in a hole for months.  It's making me hungry.  You know, we're going to go to break with, I think Troy came up with a little bit that's  going to have some legs.  Yes.  A bit called Under the Gun.  Under the Gun.  Yeah.  We'll just play it going into break over here.  Check this out.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Under the Gun.  The verbal annihilation of one Opie and Anthony show member.  Today, primetime, Sam Roberts. 
[00:53:00]  I'm Sam Roberts.  Die, Sam, die.  Oh, my head is covered in pubes.  Sam loves black dick.  You should get a job on WPU.  I want you to jump off the George Washington Bridge.  Drown Sam in period blood.  You suck and you're a tardy.  Set Sam's hair on fire.  You sound like a progeria kid.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Oh, God.  What are you, in fucking junior high?  You stink, Sam.  Who else will feel the wrath? 
[00:53:30]  Find out on the next Under the Gun.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show on the fire at SiriusXM.  For the minors. 
[00:54:00]  For the minors.  I don't know how many days it was, but a little humble pie for everybody.  Always thought the Black Crows should redo this song.  Just a dumb little thought I always had in my mind for many, many years.  I should have mentioned it to Chris on the aircraft.  You had Chris Robinson on your plane on the way in?  Jimmy?  He was in the seat.  I was in the middle seat, and he was one seat over with his girlfriend or whatever.  Yeah.  And they had a baby.  The baby was very quiet, though.  It was nice.  How old is the baby?  Infant.  Like, you know.  Probably in touch the bitch. 
[00:54:30]  I wonder if...  Because we don't see Chris Robinson out and about anymore, ever since him and Kate Hudson  broke up.  Kate Hudson and him have a kid together, and now you're trying to say, maybe this is breaking  news, that he has a kid with somebody else now.  Oh!  It has to be.  I think it's him.  Do people know that?  Or is he trying to keep that under wraps?  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything about him having another kid.  Can you make up a picture?  I think it was Chris Robinson.  He has, like, a little tattoo.  I will laugh so hard when you go, oh, it wasn't Chris Robinson. 
[00:55:00]  I know he was somebody famous, because the flight attendant was talking to him, talking  about some show that he was doing.  He looked like that?  Yeah, he was skinnier than that.  I'm almost 100% sure.  Let me see his tattoos if he has anything on his hand.  Hand tattoos.  Like, um...  Yeah, that was him.  It was him.  Really?  Yep, I recognize his tattoos.  He has, uh...  The flight attendant was talking to him, saying, like, such and such, when you did that gig  that one time, that show, whatever, he goes, yeah, it was Phil Lesh and a couple...  Like, I knew he was a singer, and I thought it was him. 
[00:55:30]  All right, Jimmy.  You think you've talked enough this week?  I know.  I really...  I like to talk.  It's all excited.  Jimmy's back.  From his big L.A. trip.  It was too long.  I can't be in L.A. that long.  It was just the logistics of it.  Oh, God forbid you're in L.A. that long, you know, with the hustle and bustle and doing  Leno and stuff.  Dino's back!  Right.  Everybody, Dino's back!  Barney, Dino's back!  I gotta play the Jay Leno intro from last night.  Oh, yes.  Because it's laughable at this point. 
[00:56:00]  We all know why he's doing it.  He loves the show.  We know he loves the show, but we also know why he's doing it.  We gotta be honest.  Honestly, first thing he said to me when I sat down in the dressing room, he goes, hey,  how's the guy's doing?  No one has contracts.  You guys all signed up.  He really, the first thing he asked was if everybody was signed up and we were cool.  That is literally the first thing he said to me.  Well, we're signed up.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, you gotta be quiet.  But he is aware.  I think he's got a little mad that we're talking about how we got fucked.  Sorry.  What's this we shit? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, Anthony has completely separated himself from me.  Anthony has completely separated himself.  He's not going down with this ship this time.  The new symbol's going to be O.P. and Anthony.  It's going to be an O with a bridge next to it and an A.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That's fine.  I'll take my shipping.  We love having the next guy on.  He's the co-host of the O.P. and Anthony radio show.  The number one radio program in the history of satellite radio.  Please welcome Jim Norton.  Jim, come on out.  Fucking Leno.  That's hysterical. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, he's great.  Leno knows how to play.  Yeah.  That's why I love the guy.  Fucking guy.  In the history.  So how many miners have we rescued?  Up to eight or nine?  Yeah, we did all those jokes as we started.  You didn't know, though.  You were on a flight.  Yeah, they're rescuing miners.  I wonder if Uncle Paul's at the top of the hole there.  He called him to help out.  Yeah.  By the way, we got a very moving letter from an intern. 
[00:57:30]  Yes, we did.  Dustin.  Yes.  It's moving from my hand to the garbage.  Gordon Gekko was happier to get birthday cards in the original Wall Street.  Anthony was to get his...  What's wrong with you?  Ah, fuck him.  Why fuck him?  He was an intern on a show.  I never even know their names.  It turns out this is going to be one of the highlights of his entire life,  and you can't appreciate a little thank you note from him?  Watch this.  That's what I usually do.  Why are we changing roles?  No, because this is what I do with this. 
[00:58:00]  Listen.  There's all your happy to fucking have done this.  It's not just a thank you note.  Feel the paper.  It's very thick.  It's like a wedding invitation kind of a thing.  It's very thick.  He went all out with his thank you cards.  Oh, my God.  Thank you so much for...  I never got a thank you card from an intern.  There's a reason.  I don't want one.  Yeah, because you don't even acknowledge them.  I don't know their names.  They come in.  They leave.  They're like fucking replacements in the nom.  I got one.  Hello, Jimmy. 
[00:58:30]  I had a great time interning for the show over the last six months, during which time I saw  and heard many funny things.  The best, though, was when my friend and I got VIP comps to see you at Caroline's on Broadway.  This is the best part.  Oh, God.  He's a good boy.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  A freebie.  I look forward to your return to Newport, Kentucky.  That makes one of us.  To the funny bone.  Oh, yeah.  That's actually, I think, the Cincinnati funny bone it's considered, because it's right in  the border.  Is that him?  If you're ever stuck in Cincinnati, oh, I was right.  Look me up. 
[00:59:00]  I know both of the fun things to do here regards Dustin.  Like, he was joking, but here's why I'm happy.  What?  Because he fucked up, because he wrote it in his stupid handwriting.  And he went to write both of the fun things.  But he wrote both of the things, and he had to put that little carrot.  He had the same one I had to do to mine, too.  He had to squeeze the word in.  Pop his picture up.  Oh, he probably did that as part of the joke.  I have no idea who that is.  Yeah, you do.  He shaved his head during his internship.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Let me look. 
[00:59:30]  I'm trying to picture him with a shaved head.  Can we Photoshop it?  No, I have.  He shaved his head.  And not only that.  Did he shave his beard or anything?  He got a huge Opie and Anthony tattoo while he was here.  Really?  That we didn't.  And he was hoping that would mean we'd bring him in and talk about it.  We never did.  He's got a huge...  You never brought him in and talk about a tattoo?  I don't know this guy.  He went as far as to get an Opie and Anthony tattoo.  Sorry.  And he would roll up his sleeve and stuff, hoping we would notice it, so then we'd bring him in.  I wish you the best, but... 
[01:00:00]  Mine says, hi, Opie.  Thank you so much for allowing me to intern for your show.  It was an amazingly surreal experience.  My only regret is that you and Jimmy weren't present for my time on the air.  And you don't remember this guy?  You did radio with him one day when me and Jimmy were out.  Alone?  Yeah.  I guess so.  With Patrice.  It says, but Patrice really stood up and made the occasion special for me.  I hope to enjoy the O&A show for years to come.  If you're ever in Cincinnati, what'd you get? 
[01:00:30]  What's your...  Cincinnati?  No.  If you're ever in Cincinnati, what did he say?  Oh, call him up.  We'll go shooting.  And what did he say for you, Jimmy?  If you're ever in Cincinnati, look me up.  I know both of the fun things to do here.  And he put fun with the little arrow of the carriage.  Well, for me, it's if you're ever in Cincinnati, try Montgomery Inn.  Best ribs in the world.  Best regards, Dustin.  I don't like ribs.  I hate ribs.  I'm not a rib guy.  I'm not a rib guy.  Ribs are great.  You like the ribs? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I liked our sponsor there, Carson's.  Oh, actually, they would send some good stuff from time to time.  Hells yeah.  I forgot about that, yeah.  Are they still advertising?  I hope they are.  They do.  They come back every so often.  I think we did a good job for them.  They come back every so often.  I throw a couple of racks of those on that goddamn barbecue.  Even though they're cooked already, you put them on the barbecue to heat them up?  Holy shit.  Oh, the cable just broke.  These miners are fucked.  Cable broke.  Let's start twittering.  What?  The cable broke. 
[01:01:30]  Look.  How are they supposed to watch all their favorite television programs that know cable television?  Hey, I already forgot his name.  The Islander there with the blowjob gesture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was Neski.  Yeah, we were yelling and screaming yesterday, and I said they're going to have to suspend this guy.  I was definitely off, and I figured I would be, but he's going to get two games.  Two games suspension?  For doing the blowjob fucking gesture.  Two games is...  To one of the biggest assholes in the entire league, and I say that in a nice way, because 
[01:02:00]  I would love an Avery on the Islanders.  Two games is enough to say no, no, no, but not enough to where the press has to pick up  on it to the point where they have to explain what he did.  Yeah.  That's perfect, then.  And I want to thank all the hockey fans on Twitter yesterday, because they were sending  me videos of the blowjob gesture as part of hockey, Anthony.  Because you've got the stick, so it's very easy to work the shaft and then do the mouth thing. 
[01:02:30]  Although baseball players don't really use it, and they have the bat, but they don't all have a bat.  So I guess you've got to be mad with the bat in order to do it.  Everybody on hockey, you've got to stick, so you can always do the blowjob thing.  Right, right, right.  Oh, I forgot.  There was another video I forgot to tell you about.  Danny, maybe you can find it.  I'm sorry.  It might be a little rough.  There's a guy in the stands that's taunting a player with the best blowjob gesture ever.  And it's hockey again.  Is that a part of hockey we just never picked up on? 
[01:03:00]  I'm starting to think it is.  Damn.  All right, fuck, you've got to save these links so it's easier to find.  Hockey fan taunt?  This might be it.  That could be it.  Yeah, this might be it.  Chicago gets them.  Milwaukee?  Oh, yeah, this might be it.  How about that?  They're against the glass.  That's the glass.  Breaking them up.  Send me that link. 
[01:03:30]  I've got to tweet that, please.  He was doing the round and round in the mouth.  That could be the best one ever.  That is a great one.  It was a guy in the stands.  Not only was he doing the round and round, he was also doing the tongue cheek poke.  Yeah, tongue cheek, so when you're moving, the tongue makes it look like the head of  the dick is pushing the cheek out.  Yeah.  So he really is a pro.  It was a big sports story, Jimmy.  That's hysterical.  Yeah, the hockey player.  Yeah, the hockey player.  He gets two games suspension. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  I thought it would be more.  I really did.  But I guess you can't, like you're saying that, make a huge deal about it.  Yeah.  You kind of want it to just go away, right?  They certainly do.  Yeah.  It's very hard to cover.  Very hard to say what he did without bringing up oral sex.  Oh, horrible things like that.  When you were out in L.A., did you see the, I guess it was yesterday, did you see the  band closing down the L.A. freeway?  It's a huge story today.  I'm on the 101, I think.  I'm aware of it, but I didn't see it.  Oh, it's Jimmy, Jimmy Know-It-All. 
[01:04:30]  It's Jimmy Know-It-All.  I had a 101.  He was on.  What road is?  Yeah, I was in the bus business with his father.  Michael parked the bus here.  Yeah.  It was a publicity stunt.  They said to raise awareness about child homelessness.  Get out of here.  But it's not.  It's about the band.  Of course it's about the band.  The bus driver took their keys and left.  Ugh.  I can't wait for the lawsuits to fly in.  And the bus is.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The bus is where your father's bus is. 
[01:05:00]  The bus had to be towed off the freeway.  So they stop the bus, the bus driver walks away with the keys, and then the band plays on  top of the bus?  I think they blocked the fucking lanes.  They turned it over three lanes.  You've got to love this, then.  Fucking assholes.  Someone, you know how mad people must have been?  Yes.  People fucking, uh, the lawsuits are going to come in.  Is the band good?  I don't know.  It's, uh, the band's called Imperial Star.  Everyone's talking about them, though.  Here's the song that they did live, I think.  It's called Traffic Jam 101. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, really?  We'll play a little piece.  Oh, my God.  See, I don't mind when, like, U2 does this or some of those other bands.  Uh, the Beatles did it once, right, on top of their recording studio.  They have some kind of message on there, too, about homeless children or some shite.  They had to. 
[01:06:00]  It's really about them.  Of course it's about them.  But they had to put a message about kids so people didn't shoot them.  That would be fair enough, right?  Oh, God.  There's nothing going on there.  Pendulum is swinging back the other way on the freeway.  Yuck.  Look at these dummies.  Get out of the road.  Officers came charging to the scene to assist the California Highway Patrol. 
[01:06:30]  Even after the order is given to move, the three guys keep on singing.  I think it's a nuisance.  Yeah, I mean, it gets their point across, I guess, maybe, because they're getting coverage,  but it's a nuisance.  This is how an independent music label decided to publicize what it calls  the ongoing problem of homelessness among children.  Channel 4 spoke with a representative from the independent label behind it,  Imperial Stars, earlier today.  He says all proceeds from the song they're singing will go toward housing and feeding children.  He denies the stunt was an attempt to shoot a music video 
[01:07:00]  or even publicize the song itself.  Now tell that to the thousands of people in that traffic jam.  Hopefully they can get their activist stuff out, you know,  in a different way than this.  You know, this is kind of sad.  The whole thing finally ended when police arrested the three men  and took them away in handcuffs.  The charges?  Beaten them.  Not clear yet.  Suffice it to say, the cops intend to make sure others don't try stunts like this.  Nah, they can't really charge them with much. 
[01:07:30]  They should have just beat them.  A little something, but yeah, they should have beat them, made an example out of them.  I would always sing for kids to band.  I would sing, Tora, Laura, Laura.  Ew!  Creep.  Yikes.  That's a publicity stunt for the band, man.  Yeah, of course it is.  It has nothing to do with kids being homeless.  Lamos.  But you know what?  Good for them.  They figured it out.  Everyone's talking about them now.  I don't think their music will back up their publicity, though.  I don't think so.  Gotta make sure your shit backs up your publicity, right? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, that song's dumb.  Can't have a shitty band and then do something like that.  Then you're gonna go away quickly.  Fuck them.  Without reaping the benefits.  Wish I'd fucking track the trailer full of fuel would have just broadsided that truck.  How about an ambulance?  I mean, you could get by.  I don't think they had all lanes blocked.  Just a couple lanes.  Oh, really?  But that makes it easy for everybody when there's one lane for everybody.  Yeah, what if there was an ambulance trying to get somewhere, emergency vehicle?  Or a woman trying to give, a woman who is, you know, like having, going to labor pains 
[01:08:30]  or something.  Yeah.  I guarantee these guys are gonna get sued by a shitload of people for being late.  Sure.  You wanna do a little jock-tober, Ant?  I love the jock-tober.  I mean, we're all about the minors.  Yes.  We're waiting for the next guy to come up.  We're waiting for him.  And hopefully the next guy will have a gimmick.  Yeah.  How long does it take to get them up?  We heard 15.  We heard 45.  I don't know.  But they were saying they were gonna be there until Christmas.  So they're actually up sooner than they expected. 
[01:09:00]  A lot sooner.  Yeah.  All the fucking...  You know how bad these guys are?  They're lucky to be alive.  I mean...  Yeah.  I don't know.  Fucking 60 days on a mine?  Yeah, that is kind of fucking amazing.  Dude, these guys should have been dead.  Especially chilly.  Because it's like, you know...  We had the thought that they were all blowing each other because they thought they were gonna die.  And now they have to come up to the surface.  They just want some kind of sexual contact before you die.  And then they get rescued and they're just walking around like...  You know, one guy will have to tell the world in a book what really happened down in the hole. 
[01:09:30]  You know, a lot of times you're in a situation that many people don't understand.  Hey, Sambo.  Sambo?  Oh, oh, Sam.  I called you Sambo right in front of your parents.  I don't know if they like that.  My dad calls me Sambo.  Does he?  I didn't realize the racial undertone...  Just don't call you late for supper.  That's right.  My kid was being held by Sam's father. 
[01:10:00]  What?  And Sam's father still has the handlebar mustache.  And my kid is definitely my kid.  Fucking was ripping at the mustache.  Was he trying to pull it out?  He was trying to rip it off his head.  He was trying to pull the fucking handlebar.  The only one in the room with any sense.  Jesus.  I'm like, yep, this is my son.  All right.  Right in front of everyone.  He don't give a shit what anyone's thinking.  And he's just trying to rip the fucking handlebar off Sam's father's face. 
[01:10:30]  We had to remove him.  Yeah, we did.  He's a good boy.  Who, my dad?  Yeah, your dad's all right.  A good boy, your dad?  I learned how old he is.  He's doing something right, man.  That buttermilk and...  Sardine and onion sandwiches.  It's keeping him looking young.  It's the raw potatoes.  I don't even want to give out his age,  but I would have guessed 10 years younger than what he is.  Are you flirting?  I think it's the sardine one.  Oh, he's a little smitten.  Actually, all right.  You want to get into this, I think? 
[01:11:00]  With that sardine breath for kisses.  Yeah.  He's got little crackers in his mustache.  Sam started this.  Your mom, Bobby.  Uh-oh.  Bobby's all right.  You think so?  Yeah, she's all right.  She takes care of herself.  She sure does, Sam.  She fries up chicken.  She's, I mean...  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck's going on inside your parents,  but outside they look a lot younger than they are.  I think they're both in good health.  They haven't had any major inner issues.  What's Jocktober about there, Sambo?  Well, this morning we're traveling to Roanoke, Virginia. 
[01:11:30]  Roanoke, Virginia?  Hey, we didn't play the intro yet.  Then never mind.  Let me pull my headphones off.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to remember this for deafness.  Go, E-Rock!  It's Jocktober.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Come on, guys.  Thank you!  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God!  I can't believe it! 
[01:12:00]  Yes!  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  We're going to where, Sam?  Roanoke, Virginia.  Okay.  And we're going to be listening to your number one station for today's hit music, K92 and  the Morning Thang.  Morning Thang?  Morning Thang.  No, no, no.  Morning Thang.  Thang.  Why are you saying it weird?  Spelled T-H-A-N-G.  Thang.  That's how they say it.  Morning Thang.  Morning Thang.  With Danny and Zach, and of course, not mentioned in the title of the show, their pal, Monica. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, God.  Jimmy, you've missed some great Jocktobers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This has been a winner of a month.  Yeah.  You would have had fun with yesterday's.  The four-word weekend.  Yeah, four-word weekend.  Yeah, you missed the four-word weekend.  And don't forget about the marriage report card.  And the marriage report card.  You missed that yesterday.  The hosts were married.  They were actually married this time.  They gave each other letter grades on how they were doing as a spouse.  Yeah.  Did he ever just a C for being who she is? 
[01:13:00]  I don't think we made that joke.  Fuck.  I wanted a sister's.  Yeah, yo.  Oh, we got a sister?  Monica is indeed.  Monica is a sister.  And what are the other two guys?  They're white men.  Yeah, they are.  White men.  They're white.  Oh, God.  They got to work from five to ten?  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Well, I mean.  Who's their agent?  I remember when we used to have to work five hours.  Christ on a pony.  They're also playing the hits and milking these call and break. 
[01:13:30]  Like, you guys get frustrated because you have to fill four or before five hours with  creative, funny material.  Yeah.  It would be easier if you guys took that pressure off yourself and just said, just material.  Fuck.  Look.  It doesn't have to be creative or funny as long as it's just there.  It's words.  All right.  As long as you're just saying things.  That's good.  Let's play a George Carlin bit or something.  Right.  Something like that.  We'll play some Black Crows in honor of Jimmy's playing with Chris Robinson. 
[01:14:00]  Wow.  Why not?  You're going way back.  House of Blues.  House of Blues.  And then come back and you just do what they do on the news.  Like, yeah, surprise that minors are on their phones.  We should catch up, Jimmy.  He hasn't been here in a week.  Anthony now does a terrific Lou Holtz impression.  But I have to hear it again to do it again.  And we're all about just trying to talk like Ira.  Yeah, you can't not talk like Ira.  What else happened in the last week?  It's a lot of fun to talk like Ira. 
[01:14:30]  I love Ira.  He said the other day, he was like, I'd like to come back in on your show.  Just not on a Friday.  He says he needs a new day.  I need a new day.  A new audience for Ira.  So we've been calling him and I guess his voicemail picks up.  But his voicemail announces that you've reached the weatherman.  The weatherman.  Reached.  A few people are saying that we beat the shit out of Ira.  Yeah, we did. 
[01:15:00]  There was a CBS protest when CBS was going off the air a few years ago.  And Ira is a big CBS FM fan.  And I guess we talked to him when we have no idea.  That was intern Sam's first man on the street bit.  So we're trying to find the audio.  But I guess we beat up our pal Ira.  Yeah, we'll find it.  All right, let's do it.  I have a question.  What happened?  Wasn't there something with a guest that had a problem too?  Oh, yes.  Afterwards, thought something was...  I don't know if it's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is it all fixed?  Yeah.  It's fixed?  What was it?  What happened? 
[01:15:30]  Obi's rubbing his face like, you know how you rub your face and you're like, I don't  want to even want to deal with it.  Because I was just trying to be a good guy yesterday.  I don't know if I...  What?  Well, I...  What?  I removed something from my Twitter and apologized.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  And I apologized.  Was it every Twitter and to everybody?  Yeah.  But it seemed like what I tweeted was fine because it was everywhere. 
[01:16:00]  But for some reason, it wasn't fine.  Oh, that was the problem.  Yeah, because...  All right.  Quote, stolen photos.  Really?  I didn't know.  And the publicist is up our ass.  Like, I thought you guys were friends with him.  I'm like, we are friends.  We didn't know.  If this thing is everywhere, who are we to not tweet it?  Oh, TJ.  But when people catch it.  Oh, you can't see.  I could say.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to do the right thing for once in my stupid career.  No, but I'm not trying to start a thing. 
[01:16:30]  I'm just trying to...  Yeah, it was...  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you wrote it already?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it looked like...  If you just...  I don't...  But...  I don't know.  E-Rock, what happened?  E-Rock's in the booth.  He, uh...  The publicist was fucking really mad and livid, though.  Yeah, she's...  Wow.  She's like, that's what he gets for doing your show, the only radio show he chose to do 
[01:17:00]  because he thought you guys were friends?  Yeah, he, uh...  He was following your Twitter shortly after he left.  Oh!  And, uh...  But it's everywhere!  Both, uh...  Him and his wife saw it and were really upset, so they called screaming at the publicist,  saying, how did you do this to us?  It's everywhere.  And he started it by saying how hot his wife was.  I know, that was the odd thing, but...  Which made us like, you know...  Didn't he say, you gotta check out how hot my wife is?  He said, check out the video. 
[01:17:30]  So if we're gonna check out how hot your wife is, we're gonna check it out.  And then if we find something that seems to be everywhere and seems to be something that he and his wife are fine with, then...  Maybe it was sanctioned.  These are like...  And these aren't like candid shots that were taken through a keyhole.  Right.  These are modeling shots.  He's very pretty.  But now I'm hearing...  Those are the ones you Twittered that he got made at?  Now I'm hearing the shots were stolen, but they're everywhere.  So, uh, I...  Ah, whatever.  What, is she Asian or something else?  She's a combination?  We didn't do it on purpose. 
[01:18:00]  We really thought this was fine to do.  If you just put in her name without any keywords, just her name...  They don't even give her name out.  In images.  She's naked on the first page.  Right, right.  First page.  I know.  I know.  So why are they having a problem with what I did?  It seemed obvious that she had no problem with this.  Well, apparently I was told that they were a private shoot and they were stolen.  That's...  And put online.  Come on.  I mean, how is anybody supposed to know that?  That's exactly what I told her.  And I...  Thank you.  She was complaining.  She goes, well, you hosted it on your website.  I'm like, we don't have a website.  We don't have a website. 
[01:18:30]  We're not doing anything with these.  We just tweeted it quickly.  Eh, we're assholes.  Look, it's everywhere.  What do you want?  And it's everywhere.  I know.  This wasn't some weird hidden site that you got to try to figure out.  No.  It's the easiest search you could do.  Wow.  She's fucking...  That looks good right there.  Did you get back to them yesterday?  Now we're just doing the same thing.  We're just like, oh, wow.  Check out.  Yeah.  I got back.  I said, you know, he posted a retraction on his Twitter.  And she goes, thanks.  And then hung up the phone.  Oh, God. 
[01:19:00]  I'll put the link up for everybody.  Oh, shit.  Fuck that.  I did the right thing.  And you know what?  We explained ourselves.  Go back on that one, Daniel.  We had no fucking idea that we were doing anything wrong.  When he started and said, my wife is really hot.  You got to check this out.  Oh, whatever.  And then you look a little deeper and you realize, wow.  You don't come to a radio station and treat a man like Seth Green like that.  What the fuck?  Really?  Get Seth Green on the phone.  Get him on the phone.  I didn't give a shit.  We weren't saying the name.  Get him on the phone. 
[01:19:30]  It's Seth Green.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Of course.  I think everyone figured it out.  I literally read in the emails going back and forth.  I was like, what happened?  I didn't know.  We had a good appearance with the guy.  And then as he's leaving, he's like, you got to check out my wife.  Like, he wanted to brag how hot she is.  So then we did a barely.  We didn't have to do much of anything to search to find what I ended up tweeting.  And I'm assuming if it's everywhere, then why would they have a problem with that?  I don't get it.  If you know her name, you can see her naked. 
[01:20:00]  Put it that way.  It's extremely easy and it's not hard.  It's one of the first Google images that come up.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And so they're mad at me?  Why?  Maybe because you were another outlet for it.  I'm just playing the devil's advocate.  Dude, it's everywhere.  Yeah.  Why would I do that?  Because it's the devil's advocate.  And he's short.  Oh, see, now you're going to cause problems.  I thought that was the problem because we made a couple quick little short jokes.  But, you know, that's what we do to our friends. 
[01:20:30]  We beat them up a little bit.  Yeah, he needs a win.  And even if you put in...  Make him taller.  If you put in Seth Green wife, she comes up naked on the first day.  Wow.  Okay, it's not hard.  So why are they mad at me?  Seriously.  Get them on the phone.  My only guess would be, did they think that you knew that they were...  Jimmy, I had no idea.  We had no idea about this.  We had a nice time with Seth Green.  And he was the one.  I don't even know if it was on the air.  But I think as soon as we went to break, wasn't it?  He goes, you guys got to check out how hot my wife is. 
[01:21:00]  And we're all awkward.  Like, okay.  So then he shows us a video she's in.  And we're like, wow, yeah, she's really hot.  And then, of course, Danny knows what he's doing with the computer.  He just does one little type.  So it was Danny's fault.  One little search.  And it was everywhere.  And then I said...  Oh, now I see.  And then I said, let's tweet this.  It's Danny's fault.  That's how it went down.  It's not a pay site.  It's nothing.  It's just everywhere.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Danny.  And they go, we thought, you know, he thought you guys were friends. 
[01:21:30]  I'm like, we are friends.  The publicist was really cool about it, though, E-Rock.  Oh, where's E-Rock?  Oh, boy.  Who's this guy?  One of the miners that was rescued?  There's Troy.  Troy also spelled on the phone screen.  Troy also spelled miners.  M-I-N-O-R-S.  After E-Rock.  Tell Troy he's dressed like fucking Perry's father in The Wanderers.  Oh, wow.  It's a stupid outfit.  Swinging.  Swinging the guy around.  Exactly.  Big people up.  Yeah, he'd be swinging a ducky boy in that outfit. 
[01:22:00]  Ducky boy.  He has a t-shirt, and it's like a cream-colored shirt over it, buttoned down.  What's the guy's name?  I forget his name.  Yeah, he was a prick, wasn't he?  Oh, was he a big pig?  E-Rock, what do we got?  Well, it's too early out on the West Coast.  I left the...  But she hung up on you after you told her that I did the right thing?  Yeah, explain to her.  And she goes, okay, thanks, and then hung up.  Do you think she maybe said thanks, and they said...  Did she say goodbye?  Whatever.  I've been told this by other people that this lady...  This is her only or main client, and she's a bit of a drama queen. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Were you nasty?  No, in fact, I was...  Were you cranky because you were hungry?  No.  I made sure to call after a nice, hearty meal.  Very good.  His stomach was growling, and she thought he was yelling at her.  Oh, damn, Sam.  After some comfort food?  Yeah.  What's your comfort food of choice, E-Rock?  Oh, God.  Cow.  You know what it is.  There's several.  Wait, which one? 
[01:23:00]  Sandwiches.  Oh, yeah.  Sandwiches.  That's not a comfort food, though.  E-Rock knows.  Well, there's a few.  Snyder's pretzels.  Those are good.  Yeah.  Give us all the low calorie stuff.  See, there you go.  Now you're talking comfort food.  Chef Boyardee's.  Chef Boyardee.  Well, they make a lot of products.  What type of Chef Boyardee?  You like the raviolis?  Love the raviolis.  I'll still eat that shit.  Mini raviolis are good.  Yeah.  The lasagna.  And spaghetti and meatballs. 
[01:23:30]  Eric likes to carbo-load.  Right, before a marathon.  And you gave up on the trainer and everything, huh?  Of eating.  No, as I said before, she left.  She left you.  And there are no other trainers.  Oh, my God.  She abandoned us.  Seth said that on the air.  You want to see my wife.  Yeah, yeah.  So he wanted everyone to know how hot his wife was.  But apparently not.  Sorry we took it a little too far.  Not too hot.  What was originally weird is in the first email, she stated that they were upset with comments 
[01:24:00]  made after he left.  So I reviewed the audio to see what was said.  What did we say?  Well, first you were saying that Seth thought Joe DeRosa was gay because he was hitting on  him.  Then you were talking that he may have a bit of a Napoleon complex, to which Opie said,  yes, because you can still sit down and pat him on the head as he walks by.  So you made...  All right.  Perhaps now we're getting to the bottom of things.  So you made fun of him.  And then talked about how... 
[01:24:30]  I'm a dick.  Then talked about how...  Perhaps now we're getting to the...  Basically what I said is I could sit in my seat and as he walks by...  Pat him on the head.  Yeah.  I don't think men like hearing that.  That's funny, though.  That's some good nature of writing.  That's a funny...  Yeah, dude.  That's a short joke.  Of course.  That's not bad.  No.  What else do we know?  That's like saying...  That's a joke about Patrice stepping on your foot.  It's like, who cares?  He's got to know he's of short stature.  He's a little fella.  Yes.  What else did we do?  Then you brought up about how he talked about showing the video with his wife when we went to 
[01:25:00]  break.  He said, I don't want to...  Let me brag for a little bit and show you my wife.  That's what it was.  Let me brag for a little bit.  Well, it was...  I don't know.  I mean, there's a lot of guys, including myself, you know, you're proud of your girl, your wife,  whatever, but it's kind of awkward to go, hey, how did he say it?  He said, El, before I go, if you allow me to indulge and brag for a little bit, let  me show you a video of my wife.  Yeah, and then we all had to have...  You know, he needed all of our complete attention so he could show how hot his wife was. 
[01:25:30]  It was so weird.  Yeah.  Right?  It was fucking weird, dude.  It was a little strange.  It was.  What if we're not into that type?  Although we were.  I mean, she's smoking, but...  Yeah.  And then the fourth thing was Colin Cain said that her ass was a bit high and that maybe  we should start a website where we tell Seth's naked wife what to do.  Oh, so it's Colin Cain's...  That's probably why the publicist thought website, though, because he said website, you know,  whatever.  But we took back the asses a little high. 
[01:26:00]  We realized it was because she was walking up a flight of stairs, so her ass looked a  little weird.  It was just one picture.  But when I got her...  Turns out she has an amazing ass.  When I got her on the phone, it had nothing to do with the show at all.  It was all dealing with Ope's Twitter.  My Twitter again.  It was a little late, but...  Yeah.  Damn it.  All right.  Mac and cheese there, E-Rock.  Oh, not in a long time, though.  That's a comfort food, though, sir.  Why don't you get another trainer? 
[01:26:30]  I could do that.  He's done.  I'm just asking.  You're done.  I mean, there's...  You've decided to live the rest of your life as a fat guy.  All right, Jerry.  What happened?  He was going to...  What happened?  He was going to go.  He's just going to be a trainer.  Why doesn't he get another trainer?  Oh, like SeaWorld or something?  I was thinking more like that elephant that steps on the stool.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All four feet.  That's amazing.  Let me go to Rice in Reno.  Rice.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  It's hot in here. 
[01:27:00]  Fuck.  Your hockey player got just fined $80,000.  80 grand for a fucking blowjob gesture?  80?  I've been watching ESPN while I listen to you guys, and that's what they said.  80 or 8?  80.  8-0.  0-0-0.  I don't think that guy makes a lot of money, man.  That's the biggest show.  80,000 would be a huge hit for him.  That's fucking crazy.  Come on.  Easy.  They gave him a two-game suspension, and now they're going with $80,000.  Can you find that, Danny?  And I would love to know what this guy makes a year. 
[01:27:30]  That's got to be a huge hit for him.  That's what they have on the screen.  80 or 8,000?  8-0.  80.  $80,000.  If it's true, it must have just hit because I'm not pulling it up.  Wow, that's bullshit.  I guess they're going to take the blowjob gesture out of hockey, too, now.  Punch it out, guys.  Fuck.  All right.  Why don't we break in?  Then we'll do Jack-tober right after the break.  I want to hear some Jack-tober.  We're going to do Jack-tober.  What?  Does that mean we get to hear the intro again? 
[01:28:00]  Nah, nah, nah.  Come on.  What are we breaking now?  No, it blows out Anthony's ears.  Nah, I got it.  As long as I can do this.  So maybe?  Sit there with my tinnitus all fucking night from these goddamn...  So were we wrong with the Seth Green thing?  I'm really confused by this one.  I am, too, still.  I'm really confused.  He brings up how hot his wife is, and then Danny does a very basic search, and what I  tweeted is everywhere.  I'm going to default, based on previous circumstance, that yes, we were indeed wrong. 
[01:28:30]  Just based on past performance.  Well, that's why I tried to do the right thing yesterday.  I removed the link, and I put a little public apology out there, without getting into details,  and now we gave all the details out on the show.  But yesterday, I kept it very vague, where people were like, what is this about?  I'm like, he knows.  Yeah.  But it was kind of like, it was a way of doing a public apology, because I don't have his  fucking number.  Eh, come on.  Chapman said I'm sorry, too.  And if we are friends, why don't we have each other's numbers?  Anthony?  Oh, what's that? 
[01:29:00]  Yes?  Huh?  What?  Uh, wow, Danny makes a valid point here.  He says, uh, that fucking kid rips people apart on Robot Chicken.  What a cock.  Are those your words, or?  Uh, no, I was reading from the, uh, thoughts of Danny Ross.  Oh, okay.  Danny Ross.  Danny Ross says, that fucking kid rips people apart on Robot Chicken.  Robot Chicken.  What a cock. 
[01:29:30]  Robot Chicken.  Well, he does.  That guy, he, look, he owes a lot of his success to that show.  I mean, he does what he does on Family Guy, and that's great.  But, you know, Robot Chicken is a, is a, is a really popular show on Adult Swim.  I'm a huge fan of Robot Chicken, by the way.  I like, I like, uh, him in Robot Chicken more than I like, uh, the Family Guy.  It's a good show.  At least Family Guy doesn't make fun of anybody, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  See?  Family Guy doesn't make fun of anybody.  He's involved in, oh, that's right.  What about, um...  I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's the publicist. 
[01:30:00]  What about the River movie, without the paddle?  Man, a lot of money, dude.  Wait a minute.  Let me say hi to Dave in Columbia.  Dave.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hi.  Um, this morning, when I was watching ESPN, they said that, uh, the $80,000 is what he's  going to lose in the two game checks that he's not going to get.  Oh.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah, that's what I'm seeing here.  But let me ask, uh, let me ask you this.  Uh, how does this work?  I need a sports guy.  Like, when you get suspended, it's suspended without pay?  Or can the team decide to continue paying you because they think, uh, their player got fucked 
[01:30:30]  by the league?  I bet they could do whatever they want.  Yeah.  No, that's a good, that's a good question for, can you go down the hall and ask, uh,  home ice on right now?  Uh.  Home what?  Home ice is not on yet.  I don't think that's the name of the show.  You're going to have to apologize again.  No, that's my show and I'm skating.  Is that what he's doing now?  Yeah, it's a figure skate.  You're a team owner.  One of your players gets, uh, suspended by the league.  Uh-huh.  But you're thinking, like, that's a bullshit thing to suspend him for, so we're going to still 
[01:31:00]  pay you.  Yeah.  Is that possible?  Or does the league say, no, if we throw down a suspension, you're not allowed to pay the  guy?  Maybe under the table.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're an owner, you know, you just, hey, the guy, you know.  You write him an appearance check.  You like the gesture.  You thought it was a good thing.  You know, you give the guy maybe a boat.  Dude, it was hilarious and this is how far I'll take it, man.  If the Rangers did that to my Islanders, I would still be supporting the Ranger player.  Uh-huh.  I absolutely would, because I like that shit in sports. 
[01:31:30]  I love the taunting and the bullshit.  It's fun.  Oh, I'm going to tweet the fan doing the blowjob gesture, too.  Oh, boy.  The fan's going to fucking be like, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  Call up E-Rock, the fan's little agent, manager, whatever.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Everyone's saying, because he's suspended, it's going to cost him $80,000.  But I want to know if the team could still pay him.  That's the question today.  All right, we'll figure it out after the break. 
[01:32:00]  Jack-tober next, Anthony.  Yes.  All the Anthony show from the virus, Sirius XM.  I don't want to come back down from this cloud.  You're taking me all this, all this time.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  I know why we're playing this.  Gavin Rosdale.  What about him?  Birthday.  Did a little gay back in the 80s.  What?  A little gay.  A little gay?  Admits to long-rumored gay affair in the 80s.  With who?  I don't know.  I'm trying to find the story.  I didn't know we were going to do this.  My goodness.  Comes off as a little effeminate.  We interviewed him.  I guess he got over it. 
[01:33:00]  We interviewed him.  Yes, we did.  Fucking women love this guy.  They certainly do.  Remember the Bush concert?  Yes.  When we were working up there in Boston.  And you couldn't even hear the songs because they just screamed.  It was when Bush was huge.  Girls just screamed the entire time.  Gavin Rosdale regrets admitting to 1980s gay affair with pop singer Marilyn in Details Magazine.  Let's take a look at this.  Marilyn. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah?  A source close to Gavin Rosdale tells us he's seriously regretting going on the record with Details Magazine about his 1980s affair with gender-bending pop singer Marilyn.  Peter Robinson, I guess, is his real name.  What?  In part because he then had to come clean with his wife.  Oh, jeez.  By the way...  Rosdale was 17 years old.  One-time experimentation.  Oh, oh, oh, 17 and just, oh. 
[01:34:00]  Pleaded for the magazine not to print this, but they said, fuck you.  Ah, ha, ha.  It was one time, one time only.  Gwen.  Has Iraq called Gavin to apologize or...  Whoa, look at that.  Jimmy?  Anything?  Oh, Marilyn.  Jimmy goes, oh, Marilyn.  Oh, Marilyn.  Wow.  All right.  I love the open chest. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, you fucked me hard.  Gwen didn't know that Gavin and Marilyn were actually involved.  Gavin was always...  Gavin always said before that they were just friends, and that's what she believed until Gavin had to tell her because of the interview.  Really good friend.  Boy George first wrote about Rosdale and Marilyn in his 1995 book, Take It Like a Man.  Oh, fuck.  What a rat.  Ratted Gavin out?  Fucking what?  Take It Like a Man.  Fucking Boy George rules.  Nice titles. 
[01:35:00]  Remember when he kind of wanted to keep it vague?  Not anymore.  He wrote a book called Take It Like a Man.  Take It Like a Man.  Bite the Pillow was his follow-up.  At the time, both men denied the relationship, but last year, Marilyn told InTouch magazine that he and Rosdale had been involved for five years.  For five years?  Five years.  What the fuck?  So, there's still something going on there because Rosdale said one time, one time only.  Marilyn also said that because Rosdale's band Bush was just becoming successful in America at the time, Boy George's allegations were hitting the press. 
[01:35:30]  I agreed to lie against every grain of my being.  So, there you go.  Wow.  There you go.  That's it, huh?  A bit of the gee.  All right.  Well, come there.  There you go, Gavin.  We're Sam.  We're ready for Jocktober.  We cleared the field.  Tenth minor rescued, by the way.  Ah, we're up to ten.  And came up with something great first out of the show.  You've got to have some kind of gimmick when you get out of that hole. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, or else you're just another one of the crowd down there.  There's too many people.  Right.  How many are there?  Thirty-three?  Thirty-three.  And they're kind of fighting to see who could be last.  This is the guy that came up and started chanting and got the crowd going.  He comes out of the hole like he's just fucking been working out.  Guy's sitting down there on rations, and he's waving flags and fucking...  And now he's like the big guy.  Yeah, because he had a gimmick.  He's the popular minor?  Yeah.  I want one minor just to come out and go, 
[01:36:30]  I can't believe what those faggots are still doing down there.  Those cocksucking faggots are trying to stay and get one more cocksuck in.  They're fighting it out.  They're sending other people ahead of them so they can get a cocksucking in.  It's a cocksucker's paradise down there.  I think you'd be the big guy.  I think you'd be the number one minor.  Cement the hole in.  Let those faggots just suck each other's cocks forever.  They don't care if they die down there. 
[01:37:00]  They say as long as they die with a cock in their mouth, they're living.  They turn down the food.  They're living on jizz.  It's all come.  Just tell the media it's a terrorist cell.  They're planning down there.  There you go.  They're planning something horrible.  Yeah, just cover up the hole now.  Sam.  Yes.  We're ready for jocktober, finally.  Yay.  Can you refresh our memories?  We're going where and who and what do they do?  Sam.  Well.  Sam.  Sam.  Samwise Gamshi.  That's not my name. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  Sam, go ahead.  Go, Sam.  We're headed to Roanoke, Virginia.  Ah.  For the morning thang with Danny and Zach on the K92 morning show.  Now, here's what I don't care.  Morning thang.  It's called the morning thang.  Now, the thang thang.  I think you guys say it that way.  Morning thang.  Morning thang.  The thang thang is an urban thing, right?  I mean, yeah.  Yes.  Well, it's two white guys, though.  But it's two white guys and just suburban white guys.  Just the girl is black.  Monica.  So, how did she get the whole thang thang? 
[01:38:00]  Well, you've got to spice it up for the kids, too.  She's a big one.  It's the number one.  She's a big one.  Yeah.  Well, come on.  It's the number one for today's hit music.  There's a problem in the community with obesity.  Well, you know.  I read that.  When you've got to eat fried chicken every day, right?  You don't have to.  Yeah, you do.  Have a carrot.  Have a carrot.  It's all the fast food restaurants opening up and it's easy and it's cheese.  The two-story fast food restaurants.  We were talking to Patrice about that yesterday.  Two-story fast food restaurants.  Two-story McDonald's. 
[01:38:30]  The two-story KFCs.  Dunkin' Donuts, I believe, was cited.  It's like, why is that?  In the hood, they've got like the two-story fast food places.  Because there's got to be a place to eat where you're not going to be hassled by the ruffians  who come in.  That's what Patrice said.  How do you know that?  Why else would they?  That is exactly what Patrice said.  That's very good.  Because that's the answer.  Because they send the people up to eat so that way you can come in and buy your food without  feeling like you're going to be fucking fucked up or something.  And the meetings go on upstairs, I thought.  Yeah.  You know, the meetings.  I understand the hood.  Yeah, yeah.  You do understand the hood.  Jimmy understands the hood. 
[01:39:00]  He must have heard yesterday's show.  No.  Were you listening to us?  No.  Instead of this dribble.  I was at the Jay Leno program.  He goes, no.  No.  I can't wait to watch you on Leno.  I DVR'd that shit.  I'll watch today when I get home.  It's very funny.  And I still got to do the board to death on Showtime.  Yeah.  I got that DVR'd.  HBO.  Yeah.  That's not a Showtime show.  I apologize, Jimmy.  No.  I mentioned it in DVR the wrong thing.  But we couldn't find it on HBO.  Then we assumed it was on Showtime. 
[01:39:30]  HBO.  HBO.  Oh, no.  It's HBO.  Oh, my God.  It's HBO.  Did I just DVR Showtime for no reason?  I'd better have that thing.  It's online.  You can get it.  All right.  I'll find it, Jimmy.  The gang talks about trick-or-treating being moved to a different day.  Why is trick-or-treating being moved to a different day?  Well, trick-or-treating, Halloween is on a Sunday this year.  Uh-huh.  And so people are saying on a school night.  And on the Lord's Day?  How long are fucking kids staying out trick-or-treating? 
[01:40:00]  I mean...  Oh, wait.  They do not bring up on the Lord's Sunday.  I mean, there are religious things thrown in here and there.  It's Roanoke.  It is Roanoke.  So, uh...  And that's the debate.  Monica, their female pal, makes her presence known.  Yay.  That means it's going to be horrendous.  I mean, just...  As you're listening to the clip, just pay attention to every time Monica contributes and how much...  Okay.  ...she brings.  Right.  Here we go.  The morning thing.  Should a local community... 
[01:40:30]  Ow.  Township...  Shut a...  Shut a local community...  Township...  Shut a local...  No.  The fuck?  Why is he talking like that?  Use your regular voice.  We taught you guys that less than years ago.  God.  You don't think that's his normal speaking voice?  No.  No.  Should a local community...  Township...  Village...  Change the time that kids trick-or-treat? 
[01:41:00]  Lame.  I mean, should they move it since it's on Sunday?  Well, it's Saturday, it's right there, and why not move it back to Saturday?  It seems more convenient.  Well, because Saturday's not Halloween, Saturday's the 30th, it's just the day before Halloween.  Well, it's not Halloween.  A lot of kids, maybe they go back for Bible study in the evening, why not move it back?  Oh, they do.  So it's more convenient.  There's a lot of kids...  There's a little Paul Lynn in there, too.  There's a little G.  You hear that Paul Lynn?  There's a little G sound.  That's for the old-timers.  You hear a little Paul Lynn.  Samantha...  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Santa Square...  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  A mobile nitrate for the win.

[01:56:00]  to them  I remember not liking it  I remember not liking it  I thought it was mean spirited  it's so funny  little Jimmy was mad  at Paul Lynn  I didn't like that  Paul Lynn made fun of Gene  Paul Lynn was ahead  of his time  yeah those guys  will find it  she's a dick  so we're doing  Jacktober  Danny and Zach  Roanoke  Virginia  the morning thang  on K92  with Monica  alright let's get back  to this  we'll start over  cause the guy  sounded a little like  Paul Lynn  hence the last  20 minutes of the radio  should a local community 
[01:56:30]  township  village  change the time  that kids trick or treat  I mean should they move it  since it's on Sunday  well Saturday's right there  and why not move it back  to Saturday  it seems more convenient  because Saturday's not Halloween  Saturday's the 30th  it's just the day before Halloween  a lot of kids  maybe they go back  for Bible study  in the evening  why not move it back  so it's more convenient  move trick or treat  and yeah the evening  Bible study  that's important  so it's Sunday  so what about Monday  next year 
[01:57:00]  when it's Monday  do we move it again  back to Saturday  because children today  are wimps  and they can't stay up  on a school day  children today  are wimps  I'll tell you what happens  when you move it  cause my town did  for many years  and then they finally  had an aha moment  and stopped changing it  for a reason  so I'm gonna  this is gonna  I can't believe  nobody thought about  this around here  it's like an epiphany  it's like an awakening  in just a minute  no it's not  wait I know what  Sam's getting at though  did you hear Monica  she was terrific  in that break  no break  there was nothing 
[01:57:30]  many ahas  uh huh  yeah  Saturday  what are they talking about  yeah what the fuck  are they talking about  they're just moving  trick or treating  there's a town  that wants to move  trick or treating  from Sunday  October 31st  to Saturday  October 30th  Jesus shit  you guys wouldn't  talk about something  like that  wouldn't  wouldn't you just  wouldn't you just do that  and then on Sunday  find somewhere  where they're doing  the regular trick or treat  and then you get  two days of trick or treating 
[01:58:00]  so what's the big deal  about this whole fucking thing  the kids don't even  trick or treat anymore  it's not safe  you get razor blades  in those apples  you gotta watch out  yeah yeah  and the poison  actually fucking  child molesters  it's like Paul Lind  god  uh  the debate  heats up  Monica's contributions  continue to light  airwaves on fire  this is when things  really start getting  like  to a fever pitch  like whoa  right  the thing is  is  and this is the epiphany  and my town 
[01:58:30]  went through this  because they would  just without even thinking  it was just the tradition  in my town  they would move  trick or treating  to Friday or Saturday  so that it wouldn't  interfere with school  and then they realized  our property  is getting torn up  by high schoolers  our whole  this whole thing  with moving  trick or treating  to that night  all it did  was move  the vandalism  to a night  when the kids  could be out later  right exactly  it was almost like  they wanted to move  Halloween  to not on a Friday  or Saturday  because then the kids  would have to be  home  getting ready 
[01:59:00]  for school  because when it's  on like a Saturday  they go buck wild  you got these kids  ogre talking  and all that stuff  and you have other kids  that are just out  too late anyway  you have tiny kids  out 8, 9 o'clock  still banging on your door  this is why  it should be  on Sunday  I'm with you  start moving it  when it is Saturday  Sunday is the best day  I'll tell you why  that's the best day  because you've gotten  the message  holy fuck  in the morning  so you're less likely  to go out  and do horrible things  after sitting in that pew  in the morning  so it's actually 
[01:59:30]  a good thing  you're not going  to fucking church  there's nothing  going on there  who listens to this  really  she's good  it's the number one  for today's hit music  it's number one  it is  it's the number one  hit music station  in Roanoke, Virginia  this shit is number one  that's right  what happened to radio  sure  the morning thing  mhm  mhm  that's all she contributed  by the way  that was good though  you needed that  yeah  guys they continue  with the Hollywood dirt  yeah you gotta get  some Hollywood dirt  dish the dirt  very good  very good  okay now we're gonna get 
[02:00:00]  some action  they talk about Lady Gaga's  Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga's upcoming perfume  and go a little too far  with the jokes in  there are  you guys know  a little too far  from being on the radio  that sometimes  you're on the air  and you get a little  carried away with your punchlines  and you say something  and you're like  oh  did I go a little far  I hope someone's there  to reel them in  what's that perfume smelling  it's probably like  armpit and liquid shit  with a big clit  topped fucking bottle  clit  let's say hi to Lee 
[02:00:30]  in Connecticut  Lee  yeah I gotta call bullshit  on this guys  there's no way  this is a real radio program  obviously  you ran out of this  you're making up  your own stuff  I for one  don't appreciate it  yeah no shit  it's amazing  that people are listening  to this  you can go online  11th minor was just rescued  and once again  no presentation  by the minor  nothing  as they pulled them out  they're losing their heat  they're losing their  they really are  their zest  for life  let's do the Hollywood dirt here  the celebs you crave 
[02:01:00]  the sleaze you need  Danny and Zach's  Hollywood Dirt Alert  Lady Gaga  she has a perfume  coming out in 2012  yeah  and she finally named it  and it's gonna be called  Monster  Monster  and no one knows  what it smells like yet  what do you think  it smells like  I don't know  2012  it's like two years away  uh huh  you can't wait that long  no we need to smell  the cheese now  I think it smells  like a Gorgonzola  that's my guess  poor Gaga  poor Gaga 
[02:01:30]  oh poor Gaga  Gorgonzola  Gorgonzola like cheese  in her labia flaps  Anthony  did he mean  cheese pouring out  whatever Gash  don't get ugly  you should have said it  what are they doing  I don't know  it just makes you angry  this does  this is the most  angering  fucking Jocktober  I've ever been  party to  yeah  this whole month  right  it's everyone  has been  fucking infuriating  I like this  this is because  our show 
[02:02:00]  I'll say  it doesn't get  any respect  because we're lumped in  with all this  other horse shit  we're lumped in  to the radio  fucking genre  yeah  the DJs  this is why  no one wants  no real celebrities  want to do radio shows  why would they  this is horrid  the morning thing  they would do the  morning thing  if they were in  Roanoke  good news  more Hollywood dirt  everyone  singer George Michael  a free man  he was released  from prison yesterday  he had four weeks  in jail 
[02:02:30]  he has crashed  his car  under the influence  of drugs and alcohol  I think at least  four times  four times  oh yeah  at least  and then he's had  the bathroom incident  I think he was drunk  in a public park  or something  and high on drugs  another time  out of his mind  this one  he mowed down  one of those  little photo booths  with his car  oh they still have  those in Europe  he was high  on prescription drugs  and marijuana  how fatty  says he wants to say  thank you for everybody  who has supported me  in there  it was quite inspirational

[02:03:30]  would then start  making jokes  about George Michael  they instead say  I like him  he's cool  he's cool  because you gotta be  nice to everyone  that's the culture  out there  well George Michael  we can learn  from these people  he's cool  he likes to  he's cool  he's cool  because he's  blowing guys  behind their shrubs  yeah exactly  he's got pine cone  needles on his knees  parking rides  fucking in the bushes  sucking cock  he's got Lyme disease  on his ball back  he's cool  he's gotta check  for ticks  on his taint 
[02:04:00]  pulling him out  because he needs  the cock so bad  you're Lyme Connecticut  by the way  stop  asshole  yeah  do you really think  yes  yes  I do  well  if  if  if that's the line  you're believing  I'm not  I was on the inside  just to make sure  it's cool  you nailed it  you got that nailed  oh it's just  because I've been watching  him  he's so annoying 
[02:04:30]  alright  what's going on  in women's dressing rooms  by the way  they won't let me inside  and I'm a former governor  you're not allowed in there  why  yeah  we'll try to get in  what  he's trying to get to Plum Island  you're not allowed there  are you running out  is he running out of conspiracies  he's so running out  if he's doing the Kennedy thing  stop it  is he doing Kennedy finally  yes  oh you didn't hear the clip  oh he's got  for Jimmy  oh forget about it  we'll get back to Jack Tolber 
[02:05:00]  in a second  oh yeah  he was on Larry King  last night  I don't know enough  to argue certain  like I can't  I'm still  like reading about  but a guy like  Bugliosi  who wrote that book  would maul him  in a debate  if you think so  did he ever serve  in the service  he would maul him  no thank you  thank you for your service  asshole  fuck  is that what we're saying  I was just going to say  they let me do JFK  this year Larry 
[02:05:30]  and everybody asked me  what I can bring new  to the John F. Kennedy murder  how about an audio  visual  and written confession  that's what you'll hear  this year  wow  wow  by the way  Larry's answer is great  wow  you know  he thanked me  for my service  that's the way  a real patriot  does things  you tease it  on a television show  on cable  when you've solved  the murder  of a president  that's the way 
[02:06:00]  you handle it  and you've got  the world watching  unlike his TV show  audio, visual  and written confession  what a great point  tell the world  right there  way bigger than  your dumb show  it's not about  the ratings  it's about  solving the murder  that you feel  was unsolved  you won't believe  what you don't  know  that I told you  that you might  know  what's the line  back to jocktober  the K92  morning thing  with Danny 
[02:06:30]  and Zach  in Roanoke  Virginia  featuring the  whole Monica  they do  what  oh  they bring up  the original  creative topic  of things  we used  to like  things  we used  to like  and they  talk about  coking  glass bottles  do you do that  when you're alone  do you just say  things like  I can't help  but talk like  Ira always  like if you'll say  like if you're alone  will you just go  I'm going to get  a drink 
[02:07:00]  yeah  I think I'm  going to hit  the basement  and grab  something from  the tap  he was supposed  to be in today  but we can't get  a hold of him  he wants a new  day  he doesn't want  to come in  on Friday  I gotta spread  it around  I don't know  what made me  think about  this yesterday  but as you  get older  there are certain  things you can't  buy anymore  and certain  things you can't  see  and you get  nostalgic  and you miss  them  774-92FM  toll free 
[02:07:30]  800-468-92FM  I have  an addiction  to Coca-Cola  out of the glass  bottle  that's not  addiction  you asshole  it's a preference  and you can  get it  dope  they do  sell them  he's acting  like it's  the Dead Sea  Scrolls  it's a coconut  bottle you  faggot  buy it and  drink it and  shut up  then cram the  bottle in your  tuchus  pretend it's a  wiener  put the bottle  on the fucking  floor  and just sit  on it  until it  disappears  until it 
[02:08:00]  makes that  sound  until the  label disappears  until you  bend over  and there's  nothing but  the bottom  of the bottle  highlighting  your colon  it's like a  Mengele fucking  experiment  of the glass  bottle  I love it  it tastes so  much better  and you can  kind of find  it some places  I mean even  Kroger has it  but it's so  expensive  it's $5  for little  8 ounces  yeah but you  only get like  4 of them  too  is it even a  6 pack  no it's a 6 pack  but it's a 6 pack  and they're little 
[02:08:30]  they're half the  size of the  cans so it is  it's like a  3 pack  well a can is  12 but  the can's like  16  I think the  can is 16  wow  the point is  you're right  though  it does taste  better in the  glass bottles  it does taste  better in the  glass bottle  can I tell you  something  I'm getting  off diet coke  because I finally  listened to Patrice  about aspartame  oh my god  but I will say  diet coke in a can  tastes better than  diet coke in a  bottle  guys we could  have this debate  for hours  let's go  let's go  but the thing is  he's right  a can is not  16 ounces 
[02:09:00]  it's just 12  that is true  what  you ever drink a  tab out of a  guy's asshole  you ever pour  a shasta  into a guy's  foreskin  and then suck  it out like  that frozen  ice treat  I love a  shasta out of  a foreskin  oh yeah  that's nice  should we stop  it here  I don't think  so because  I don't think  so  well we could  but then nobody  would have the  answers about  the coca cola  and glass  bottles 
[02:09:30]  I mean you  gotta keep  talking about  coke and  glass bottles  ah  because they're  not done  with that yet  no no no  it says either  Danny or Zach  tells a captivating  tale about his  crazy  because that's  how you spelled  it grandma  yeah but  could you send  an intern out  to get me  a coke and  a glass bottle  yeah I could  I really would  like one  now that they're  talking about it  send an intern out  see if he can  even get me one  but they're  so they're  impossible to get  tell him to go  to Kroger's  go to Kroger's  where's Kroger's  here in Manhattan 
[02:10:00]  they're resourceful  they'll find one  no the crazy  grandma story  has to do  with coking  glass bottles  what  what do you  guys think  it could be  um  I  uh  ooh  she fucking  saved her  uterus in it  when it fell  out  come on  she's a  hoarder  she has a  pickled punk  in a coke  it would have  been his  would have  been his  uncle  had grandpa  not gotten  drunk and 
[02:10:30]  put a fucking  horseshoe in  grandma's belly  is now a  pickled punk  in a coke  bottle  that she  would yell  at when  she was  drunk  could be  that  I'm going  for that  yes  maybe  um  uh  maybe she  was clocked  in the head  with a glass  bottle and  boo radley  mouth fucked  her  did she  have to  tampen the  remains of a  trip to  Sloan Kettering  no 
[02:11:00]  these guys  are mean  I'm just  trying to  think  his grandmother  in a coke  bottle  what's the  story  I don't  I know  they call  her a  because she  has a  she was able  to hide a  giant plastic  one in her  vagina  so her nickname  was two  liter  bessie  that's a  huge bottle  that isn't  it  no  you guys  are all  incorrect  so far  I know  the answer  her husband  knew that  she had  been bedding  in negro  because there  was a coke  bottle on the 
[02:11:30]  nightstand  and she  didn't drink  it  no no  but he  knew that  negro  gardener  used to  love coke  in a  bottle  and there  was a  newport  in the  ashtray  and her  pussy  was broken  open  one of her  pussy lips  was in the  foyer  Sam that's  gotta be it  was her  nah  you got it  yeah  her last name  was Arbuckle  nice  yeah 
[02:12:00]  that's  Domino  or something  that too  and I  remember  when  I thought  my aunt  was crazy  at the time  when they  were making  the change  over to  the plastic  bottles  my aunt  hoarded  the glass  bottles  and they  had one  of those  really old  soda machines  and they  do the  one bottle  at a time  and it's  got the  bottle  open on  the side  and I  thought  she was  kind  of  nutty  for having  this  but I  remember  going back  like eight  years later  and she  still had  the coke  in a  bottle  and it  was still  so  it was  just  different  it was  fresher  it was  different  it had  different 
[02:12:30]  flavors  there's  something  about it  in the glass  that makes  it better  and I  think the  can  is fine  but the  plastic  bottle  especially  compared  to the  glass  forget it  there's  no comparison  no comparison  and there  were her  feces in  plastic bags  lining the  staircase  and stacks  of stuffed  animals  and stemware  and then she  took some  bottles of  her fingers  and taunted  the warriors  Sam you gotta  get a montage  of the hole  of this hole  yeah for after  the break  everything she  says  she hasn't 
[02:13:00]  said anything  yet  uh-huh  did she have  a Darth  Tater  you missed  the Darth  Tater too  Jim  who's Darth  Tater  there is a  new hoarders  that I  implore you  ladies and  gentlemen  I implore you  you have to  see this  it is the  most annoying  hoarders I've  ever seen  in my life  this woman  they were  throwing shit  out  and she  sees  a box  in the  truck  and runs  and fucking  grabs it 
[02:13:30]  and then  uh  goes  look what  they wanted  to throw  away  and she's  moving the  box so you  can't see it  and the camera  zooms in  on it and  she shows  it  and it's  that  Darth  Tater  it's a  Mr.  Potato Head  version of  Darth Vader  called Darth  Tater  and she  starts  holding it  to the  camera  and making  a face  like  like  to the  audience  almost  like  can you  believe  they were  gonna throw  this out  I hate  Darth Tater  I hate 
[02:14:00]  the hoarders  looks like  E-Rock is a  boy on  Halloween  because of  the ballet  comfort  food  because of  the  Tater's  big and  rastic  oh that's  funny  that is  funny  Darth  Tater  let me go to  Tater  were you  yelling at  the TV  alone  I was  screaming  you almost  shot the  TV  I said I  was gonna  pull an  Elvis  I came so  close to  pulling an  Elvis  I wanted  to shoot  the TV  were you  alone  watching it  yes  I was mad  I was sitting  there going  Darth  Tater  let's go

[02:15:00]  importantly  CNN has  a replica  capsule  so did  Fox  they had  one  but it  was  actually  just like  it  Fox  News  has one  right across  the street  from us  yes they do  can you go  in it to see  what it's like  what is it a  ride already  the reporter  was in it  but I mean  it's right  across the street  from our  building  that's what  that thing  is I saw  that a while  ago  the yellow  thing  that isn't  it though  no  that's a dumb  one  he's pretending  he's gonna be  in a bank  and they're 
[02:15:30]  gonna just  shoot him  in a vacuum  tube  the Fox  News one  is better  who cares  look  you can  handle that  that's nothing  the prop  department  made that  in like  what happened  to Marlo  Thomas's  mouth  oh my  Jesus  she's  had some  work  oh she's  married to  Phil Donahue  that's right  for years  for years  yeah she went  on the show  once and they  fell in love  it's just so  much fun  to do  I'm almost  there  it was love  at first

[02:30:00]  video of it  well you should have  complained too  yeah we did  but they wouldn't  they wouldn't ask  them to sit down  and they would stand  and hold the babies  and shake them  with the cowbell  so it was kind of like  they should have shaken  them real hard  that makes them  shut up  wait the fucking airline  wouldn't ask them  to sit down  no I don't know  I don't know what  airline it was  it was like Walgreens  how'd they get on  with a fucking cowbell  isn't that a weapon  I don't know  I could totally kill  someone with a cowbell  we were in first class  once Bob said  we had a crying baby  or kid  and the mother 
[02:30:30]  the mother decided  to take care of the  situation by not  giving the kid candy  right  because the kid was  crying because he  wanted candy  oh you were on that  flight  and then the mother's  like no  no no  it's like  you gotta throw  your household rules  out  on a fucking plane  because all she had to do  was give the kid candy  and the kid would have  shut up  and we would have  been able to all  go back to sleep  but she decided  she needed to be a parent  at that moment  and refused the kid candy  so he continues screaming  for another hour or two  well it's amazing  you see the different 
[02:31:00]  parenting skills  because they let them  run wild up and down  the aisle  and like a little boy  was in the bathroom  literally by himself  for like 20 minutes  so I'm like  what is he doing  drugs  I didn't know  he's like  one and a half  they're screaming  they're standing  and they disrespected  everybody  but  great if he flushed  himself down the toilet  and went plummeting  down into Cleveland  it's wrong that I  frozen  one of them probably  Jesus pops  one of the moms  the moms seemed  right to me  nice  I was with my woman  and it was 
[02:31:30]  it was really upsetting  are you  are you still  with the same woman  I am  I am  congratulations  to Mr. Bob Saget  you guys turned  very officious  and sophisticated  when you  are  well I  I went out to  dinner with Bob Saget  and his girl  who he's still with  no that's a different  no that would be  oh that's what  I'm talking about  oh B  how awkward  you've just made things  that was four years ago  that was four  four girls ago 
[02:32:00]  four years ago  no no that was  one back  oh one back  oh one back  okay  not  Jimmy Stewart  on that one  I don't know  what happened  how about yourself  are you still  I'm married  and I am now  a father  how is that  I love it  do you want me  to get you guys  a cowbell  yeah for flights  I mean we're  starting to talk  about you know  the first flight  with the kid  to be honest with you  because vacation  will be around  what the holidays  a little after  so I'm debating  what do I do  do I take a chance 
[02:32:30]  there Bob Saget  what do I do  I think you get  them crated  like an animal  you know  they can breathe  down there  they say the air  is better down there  it is  it's cleaner  I actually have  I have children  from my previous  marriage  from the 20's  and the kids  that I have  you hold them  when they're like that  you don't let them  run around  and that's actually  the only thing  I said on this  flight to the lady  was you know  I don't mind  she came over  and apologized to us  and said let me  buy you all drinks  in first class 
[02:33:00]  in first class  but at least  that's all I asked  for at least  she acknowledged  that her kid  was a problem  there's a lot  of parents out there  the kid screams  bloody murder  and they don't  even acknowledge it  and just expect  you to deal with it  and the apology  was like five hours in  so it was  oh great  that's not an apology  then sir  at this point  it gets to the old  there is no other hand  kind of attitude  but you don't  you gotta hold  your kid  is all I'm thinking  they can scream  but at least  teach them 
[02:33:30]  the new confines  of the smaller  place with people  in it  sure  I cannot  how is it  having this baby  sleeping through  the night  was starting  to get up  a little bit  more now  five months  old already  that went fast  asking for the car  keys  asking for the car  keys  five months  old  the son  oh wow  Jim  yeah  and you guys  are still going  strong  which is  oh yeah  yeah  things are good  very happy  that's amazing  I'd love to  take a flight  with you guys  sometime  oh sure  that's all I do 
[02:34:00]  that's all Bob does  he just flies around  with various people  yeah I'm gonna give my kids  like big fucking symbols  though  yeah  yeah oh so you get like  the big crash symbols  just smash them together  the symbol hat  and then you put it  on the other child  and then you can just  bang their heads together  teach them how to  use one of those things  at the football games  you know  those horns  or the vuvuzella  yeah  give everybody  the batting foam  things 
[02:34:30]  right  now Bob  you're gonna be where  man  why are you calling us  I got two things  one of them  will be your house  tonight  ah  you can come over  come on over  I'm in Long Island  on  I'm at  you know where I'm at  no honestly  I mean  when you said two things  I only have  I'm at the Wellmont Theater  in Montclair, New Jersey  yeah that's Friday  I got that one  and then on Saturday  I'm at the Tilly Center  of Performing Arts  in Brookville, New York  do we know that theater

[02:35:30]  it's called Strange Days  and I went and studied  subcultures that seemed  I kind of did a comedy documentary  I'm calling it  cockumentary  and it's me  I went on the road  with a biker gang  in a sidecar  from Nashville  to Daytona  for one of them  wow  and I went and looked  for Bigfoot  in the Pacific Northwest  with a bunch of guys  they're called  Squatchers  you know  and I joined a frat  in Cornell  and I went with Jeff Ross  to kind of retrace  Hunter Thompson's  you know  fear and loathing  we were in a Cadillac 
[02:36:00]  we went to the mid 400  where he dropped acid  supposedly  oh right on  so it's like a lot  of subculture stuff  that's me  in that environment  it's been a week there  we shot 60 hours  each episode  and we're just doing  post on them now  so it'll be on soon  and it's  it's really  it's kind of in between  me being  a person that's  acceptable  to people  to watch me  on television  and then the  filthy one  that you know  you have to have  a taste for  you guys still there  yes  Jimmy's trying to  open up a bottle 
[02:36:30]  of coke  struggle trying to  open a pop top  thing with  the desk bell  and he's doing it  Anthony just did it  I don't know how to do it  you just grab it  by the neck  but you gotta use  your finger as leverage  and pop it up  from the front  that unusual  Asian bottle  upside down  huh  do you know  the Asian bottle  that has like  a very thick marble  in the top of it  no no  Jimmy  no I don't  Jimmy is  yeah like that  okay  now go  come on

[02:38:00]  it is in the Tilly Center  it's in Brookville New York  it's a CW Post venue  yeah yeah  that's right  oh right  so I'm just trying to  help you out there Bob  and the place looks beautiful  that's a nice place  my brother played there  yeah it looks  it looks great  you're going to love it there  yes  he won't compare it  to the dates  we all did together  I know  we got to try to figure  that out again  oh please  backstage  there's nothing like that  those are  those are  gone days  my friend  women stripping  behind the curtain 
[02:38:30]  right before you walk on  oh yeah  a little distraction  there was so no pussy  to be had on those gigs  it was fucking awful  I've never seen you  hired strippers  with no pussies  no pussy  they might as well  not have had them  they might as well  have had fucking  blocked out  bleeped out pussies  yeah but  Jim they had to dance  I mean  someone's got to do  the hard lifting  yeah but  it's heavy lifting  it was Patrice O'Neill  it's heavy lifting  nah the uh  the strippers  were not coughing up  any drawers 
[02:39:00]  that was depressing times  yeah that was  a little fuck  you know  well  the strippers  we had prudes  it still took me back  to a kinder sweeter time  when Otto and George  was getting ready  to go on  and there's strippers  I just felt like  I was in 1910  that was really good man  the stage was horrible  those fucking  spooky doors  there was a black cat  and I said to my agent  what the fuck  are you doing  what's this Halloween  yeah yeah  there was  the stage  do we have any pictures  of the virus stage  there was like  the silhouette  of a black cat 
[02:39:30]  ew  that sucked  honestly  no matter what  center we played  the couches were just like  porn people  wouldn't sit on them  while they're waiting  to fuck each other  look we didn't have  much of a budget  cum stain  fucking couches  what was the spooky  the spooky house theme  oh  the black cat guys  why was that  it's terrible  is what it was  it was cheap  I guess  to put together  that's exactly  how about just a plain wall  yeah  just fucking put a wall up  who cares  and the police tape 
[02:40:00]  keep out  look out  danger going on here  danger  but there was so much energy  when the stage managers  were sending you out  you would think you were out  in like ancient Rome  it was like the most major gig  in the world  those people were more civilized  than our crowd  Jesus Christ  the Coliseum  always nice in the daytime  when the gig starts  and no matter who's on stage  people can tell them  that they're shit  yeah that did happen  and then the performer  has the sun in their eyes  that was always fun 
[02:40:30]  right Bob  well I'm excited  I'm also on tour  so I'll be around  yeah please come in  and do this properly  hang for the whole morning  we'll get some laughs in  you know  as long as we're looking around  I got a new tape  five girls and a thimble  oh nice  that's tight  that's what it is  by the way  that A&E show  sounds really  really good  what did you learn  with the Bigfoot guys  anything  well you know  they're just out there  having fun  and there's a lot of  I would imagine  smoking going on  you know  they're out in the middle 
[02:41:00]  of the woods  at one in the morning  looking for Sasquatch  and you weren't convinced  right  it's all bullshit  I gotta be honest  the first couple days  I was emailing my kids  like a moron  he's real  I'm gonna see him  I know  I'm not giving it away  but  mom he exists  and when I see him  it's gonna be amazing  and my whole premise  was that if he's got  big feet  he's got a small dick  that's what I was thinking  so he was like  that's why he's hiding  that's more of an awkward  name though for him  to call him  yeah I think I saw 
[02:41:30]  small dick  it's better to say  Bigfoot  well a lot of guys  have big feet  small dicks  we're looking at  a picture of the stage  I gotta tell you  I did a lot of  high school plays  and we had better sets  in high school  dude there's one  where it's a door  it's a fake looking door  and it says  keep out  with red letters  ooh  danger going on  it dude  like Pippin took a shit  it really is horrible  ONA  ONA 
[02:42:00]  and what  baby blue  big baby blue letters  big baby blue letters  police tape  all the smoke  that was coming out  oh god  the shivings  yeah yeah  there was  and then there were  losers on the couches  that were already  stained from bad stuff  yeah  some winners  got to sit on the couches  on stage  and they decided that  because they were  sitting on the couches  they needed to attack  the performers  in some cities  yeah that was really lovely  that was smart  on our part  they were escorted  the people are in  the VIP section 
[02:42:30]  and they're the first  piece of the person  that the guard  just grabs  and they're on that  like meth  physical  freaking out mode  meth  meth mode  and they just  grabbed them  and dragged them off  and it's like  that guy was  like three feet  from me  and we asked you guys  to make sure  that the performers  could be murdered  immediately  all the velvet ropes  Jimmy  you forgot about  the velvet ropes  keep out  spooky danger  keep out  it was two years  wasn't it  that I went out  yes you did 
[02:43:00]  yeah we did  I think we did four  I think we did about four  it was like an army tour  maybe three  I'm not sure now  everybody loved it  I see people all the time  and a couple of them  can still talk  and function  yeah  and they went in  out trapping themselves  they remind me  of the virus  and then one guy  said I saw you  on the virus  but he just  many thought  I was dying  yeah  I misunderstood him  well it's a good thing  he saw you though  because the door said  keep out  danger  police tape  danger

[03:02:00]  flaccid his mule  flaccid is the same  size as mine at this  point does he have a  bigger mule than  brett farve  hope so close close  huh damn jim how  how small would you i  mean when you're gonna  take pictures of your  fucking mule on a cell  phone you do a photo  shoot yeah you know  what i mean you do  90 shots before you get  the right you look at  all the proofs exactly  you go back no i don't  like this one this  but my friend chuck  mcganelli is a comic  he has a huge dick he  had a picture on his 
[03:02:30]  phone i said chuck  forward me that  picture your dick so i  would just forward that  to chick  does chuck have a big  dick a huge yeah  every time we go into  a bar and he'd have  it on his phone we  pull it out excuse me  go for the girls up  um have you seen my  friend and we just show  his mule how what's  he packing he's packing  like nine jesus is he  really yeah he's got  like veins in it it's  fucking aorta running  very impressive it's a  work of art but isn't 
[03:03:00]  it broken chuck's got a  broken dick yeah he  does but it was this  was before it was  broken so it was nice  and straight is it  better now they get it  fixed no it's still  broke how do you fix  that hit some girl's  sternum with it that's  a breastbone pound it  away at some chick i  think he hit a dire  i don't know so wait  so his dick actually  broke can it get fully  hard he can get fully  hard but it bends to  the left right like a  fucking boomerang once  it gets hard looks like  a lizard whose tail came  off and grew back all  crooked i was into 
[03:03:30]  reptiles as a kid  of course you were  now you have the  emotional fucking range  of one  couldn't think of  range  hey florentine you're  all about uh killing  brett farve aren't you  i fucking hate him he  deserves everything he  gets but you know what  the commissioner's not  going to do anything to  him because he's royalty  to the nfl yeah yeah no  shit  brett farve i love  brett farve you know  brett's just being brett  like manny being manny  so i'm curious to see 
[03:04:00]  once this chick comes  out and says yeah he  did this and there's  proof if he does is  he gonna suspend farve  because then that  ruins his streak  executive game streak  but it has nothing to  fucking do with uh  football like when  when did this start  where what these guys  are doing off the field  matters who started  that shit  no it is it is pretty  lame but i hate him so  i'm glad for it i mean  yeah you can't send your  dick to another chick  come in come on i'd  fucking i'd be in jail  you gotta think half  the nfl is doing that  they just haven't  gotten caught right 
[03:04:30]  well people are bringing  up the fact that it is  it was an inter kind of  you know because she  worked for the jets he  worked for the jets it's  a intercompany thing  because it's human they  have human resources in  the nfl i'm certain they  fucking do shit i'm  certain bad enough it's  part of radio but uh but  i i think jim's right  they won't do anything to  him he's fucking royalty  royalty i mean seriously  i mean is his farm  streak gonna end because  of his suspension yeah  yeah the commissioner's  gonna want to do so  what they'll do i  guarantee the commission 
[03:05:00]  is gonna drag it out to  like right at the end of  the season right and  he'll suspend far two  games and a far will say  i'm gonna retire so he'll  never get the suspension  i see yeah perfect yeah  i'm not a big bread  far fan but nothing  should happen to the  guy wait jim how many  games he played in a  row has he ever missed  one no 289 in a row i  didn't miss a game wow  fuck in the nfl that's  crazy and for that  how old i know so he's  that that's why the  commissioner's gotta you  know he doesn't know  what to do yeah they  can't fuck they can't do  it over that like come 
[03:05:30]  on yeah but you know  all those fucking women's  groups are gonna come  out if he's you know it's  sexual i mean it's the  bottom line it is sexual  harassment you know against  employees and plus the two  masseuses women's groups  never come out for chicks  that have big tits like  that and fucking look old  juicy they come out for  dikey looking fucking  messes that got their ass  pinched in an office you're  right yeah that's true  yeah i got a twitter from  you did you go bowling  with fucking anthrax and  slayer anthrax megadeth and
