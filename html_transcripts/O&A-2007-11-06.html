<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts declaring themselves "radio shock jocks" and launching into their usual mix of recurring segments.  "Rock Scream Tuesday" featured 80s New Wave music, while "Makeup Stuff Tuesday" involved the creation and dissemination of fabricated news stories.  Listeners participated in crafting these false reports, resulting in a phony story about Tom Brady's NFL suspension due to an unspecified reason and a ludicrous tale of Pat Sajak's car accident.  The segment "Is E-Rock Alive Tuesday?" included exaggerated, comedically bad voice impersonations of a co-worker, whose health was the (joking) subject of the segment.  A discussion about staph infections, athletic supporters, and the perils of over-sanitizing followed.  The hosts then expressed vehement dislike for Zoe Koplowitz, a woman with MS who participates in the New York City Marathon, focusing on negative commentary about her appearance and accusing her of attention-seeking. This was contrasted with their perceived lack of media attention towards other, allegedly more deserving, marathon runners, including a critical commentary on Katie Holmes' participation for breaking the rules by using an iPod.  A Brian Regan bit about fake bird sounds on a golf broadcast was played. The fabricated Tom Brady and Pat Sajak stories were revisited at the broadcast's close.

The show continued with further discussion of Zoe Koplowitz and her marathon participation, comparing her unfavorably to other runners.  This transitioned into a discussion of Oprah Winfrey's failed African girls' school, focusing on allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation, and the broader challenges of imposing Western ideals on different cultures. The difficulties of operating a school in a region rife with disease, rape, and genocide were mentioned.  A significant portion focused on listener reactions to the "Two Girls, One Cup" video, playing audio clips of shocked, disgusted, amused, and even vomiting responses from various people including comedian Robert Kelly and a group of six women.  The hosts commented on the video's viral nature and the entertainment value found in observing others’ reactions.  The NFL's suspension of Tom Brady (initially based on an AP story) and Britney Spears' new album were mentioned as news items, alongside a winning caller receiving $1,000. Tyra Banks' show on the vagina was heavily criticized, with particular attention given to a vulva puppet.  The "sound of the day" was chosen as "How'd your parents die?",  and a guest, Roland, contributed to a discussion of the Hollywood writer's strike.

A later segment began with a discussion of baseball manager uniforms, immediately segueing into another scathing critique of Zoe Koplowitz, employing derogatory language.  A graphic and vulgar description of a slaughterhouse followed, transitioning to further discussion of Tom Brady's potential suspension and a critique of contemporary television.  Extensive audio clips and discussion of the Tyra Banks segment on female anatomy, featuring the large vulva puppet, dominated a portion of the broadcast.   The hosts then discussed individuals with unusual medical conditions – conjoined twins (Reba and Laurie Chappelle), a person with extra limbs, and an armless golfer –  using highly offensive and dehumanizing language.  Callers Rob (Jersey), Cheryl (Boston), Brandon (Atlanta), Brian (Massachusetts), and Mike (Missouri) contributed to the conversation at various points.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of the Brady suspension and further off-color jokes.

The next segment centered around Tom Brady's steroid-related suspension and a detailed, highly graphic, and sexually explicit discussion about the conjoined twins Reba and Laurie Chappelle, including audio clips of the twins themselves.  DL Hughley joined the show in studio.  The conversation shifted to Hughley's HBO special, a New Jersey intern’s alleged necrophilia, and the hosts' and Hughley's strong reactions to the "Two Girls, One Cup" video.  Discussions of race relations in America (in the context of the 1992 Los Angeles riots), with Hughley sharing personal anecdotes, and the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls (and allegations of impropriety) ensued.  Other topics included a multi-limbed baby from India, Dog the Bounty Hunter, and the upcoming presidential election.

The final segment focused heavily on New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevy's sexual activities, featuring graphic descriptions and sexually explicit commentary from the hosts and D.L. Hughley.  A comparison between discrimination faced by gay people and Black people sparked a debate.  A significant portion detailed a video (possibly from Lemonparty.org) of older men engaging in sexual acts, along with reactions to it.  Further discussions involved bizarre internet pornography, including "two girls, one cup," animal sex, and audio clips (allegedly) of a chicken and a duck engaging in sexual activity.  D.L. Hughley expressed discomfort at points.  The segment concluded with Hughley promoting his appearances and the hosts wrapping up the show, punctuated by one host's complaints about something falling on his foot.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock shots.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Sock show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put 380 in my chest and a full church.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going. 
[00:01:00]  They are sick, freak.  So you're kind of like transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst.  The worst show I've ever seen.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  There it is.  Always a little delay every morning.  There's a slight delay.  No biggie.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, too.  This old gag.  Hmm.  What, ah, what special events do we have today? 
[00:02:00]  Today, it's, ah, Rock Scream Tuesday.  Yeah, we haven't taken a Rock Scream in a while.  Which might be...  It's time to get rid of that.  What?  Um, 80s New Wave Tuesday.  Eh, eh.  Listen to the 80s channel sometimes.  Um, and now we get rid of that.  Why would you get rid of our themes?  I'm a Tuesday.  I'm like, you don't get rid of that.  Far away phone call Tuesday.  What?  What?  Arizona?  No, we had Korea, Australia, Ireland.  Makeup Stuff Tuesday. 
[00:02:30]  We should get rid of all this stuff.  Hmm?  I'm making...  See, I was just making all that up.  Oh.  Because it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  See, that's the one that we need to kind of develop.  Yeah.  Makeup Stuff Tuesday could be a great bit.  Of course.  But we need the help of the listeners.  Yes.  We just want to make something up every Tuesday and see if we can get some rumors going.  Nothing that'll get us fired.  Well, of course.  You understand.  All we have to do is, uh, you know, you take a call. 
[00:03:00]  Somebody makes something up later on in the show.  Right.  Because right now, a lot of people aren't awake.  That'll be awake later.  So if you're listening early, you're in on the gag.  You're in on the gag.  And that way, when someone makes up something stupid and people call and go, really?  I didn't know about that.  Well, it started off great.  We did the whole Van Halen cancel their tour.  And everyone believed it.  And it started getting blogged everywhere.  And then people got really mad at us that we started this rumor.  Yeah.  But that's how we started Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  It worked out perfectly for us. 
[00:03:30]  Certainly did.  And don't forget 80s New Wave Tuesday.  It's a classic.  It really is.  Because you get things like this.  We can dance if we want to.  You can leave your friends behind.  Because if your friends don't dance.  And if they don't dance well, they're no friends of mine.  To have no friends.  Huh?  You have no friends.  You don't like that one?  No.  Actually, it was pretty good.  Say these New Wave Tuesday.  You want more better than you are for me? 
[00:04:00]  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  A house in the middle of our street.  A house in the middle of our street.  Don't you want me, baby?  Don't you want me?  Oh.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the LPN Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Does it have to be?  We don't even know what to do with that.  We just like the guys to sing some crazy, wacky 80s New Wave songs every week.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's why we do that.  We don't want people who can really sing, obviously.  No.  That's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  So it's sort of social.  Demented and sad, but social.  We can dance if we want to.  You can leave your friends behind.  What's happening in the hostel? 
[00:05:00]  I remember that.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  A little plus one.  And we danced.  Spent the way for our moment by chance.  And we danced.  And danced.  And danced.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the LPN Anthony Show.  That voice hits me like a hammer.  It really is horrible.  Leave him alone.  I love when he does that voice.  I'd say it doesn't come in handy for a voiceover, but. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I don't know.  It's just kind of.  Maybe he has lung cancer.  Whoa.  Oh.  Is E-Rock Alive Tuesday?  Hey.  There was a promo made.  What?  He has some kind of problems.  I know we got a little ADD right now.  Don't worry.  We'll smooth everything out and we'll be rocking for you.  But last week.  Don't worry.  This isn't going to be a weekly thing.  I'm sure E-Rock's going to be fine.  But as a joke, a little take off on, is Tom Alive Friday? 
[00:06:00]  E-Rock last Tuesday kind of admitted to us that he's got some things happening.  Some numbness.  He's out of breath a little bit.  He's going through all sorts of tests.  So then Tim jokingly did a spoof on, is Tom Alive Friday with this.  Is E-Rock Alive Tuesday?  Oh no, he could be dying.  Maybe it's the big C.  Is E-Rock alive?  Diabetes?  Narcolepsy.  Maybe a sleep apnea. 
[00:06:30]  Is E-Rock dying?  And I'm going to get down with the sickness.  And I'm going to get down with the sickness.  It's a coronary.  His arteries are clogged.  It's all that garlic butter sauce.  His arteries are clogged with mannates.  It's his nervous system.  Could he be dying?  I think he just forgets to breathe.  It's crazy, don't you know?  It's E-Rock Alive Tuesday.  How can you not like those voices, Jimmy? 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  They go right through you?  It's like a flaming arrow through my chest.  It really is.  Yeah.  Well, I want him to continue because it's too funny.  I walk down the hall and I just imitate Tim doing those voices now.  Yeah.  Oh, we got to go work somewhere else now.  Tim's not doing that to be ironic.  He really thinks those are good.  They are good, though.  I can't get enough of it.  I mean, he thinks that's quality.  He thinks that that's really cool.  Yeah.  It's a really good production.  And I'm with him. 
[00:07:30]  I'm with him, especially when he gets the whole group of characters that live in his head  together.  Like they're just a little coffee clutch, like just chatting about something.  Yapping.  E-Rock, you feeling better?  No, not really.  Did you get your tests back?  No.  Why?  They haven't called.  How long does this take?  Don't know.  Why don't you call them?  I got to go for my sleep study on Saturday.  Oh, God. 
[00:08:00]  What do they do for a sleep study?  And first of all, how are we going to do our show when they're here?  Oh, I get it.  What do you get, E-Rock?  What do you get?  Yeah, what is it?  Yeah, what do you get?  What was the joke?  Must be sleeping because I'm working.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you today?  Yeah, you sound a little sleepy.  You really do sound like...  I'm having some throat problems.  What?  Yeah.  What's the matter? 
[00:08:30]  What the hell is wrong with you?  Swallow batch?  No, it's a bit swollen.  Ooh, you might have that old...  That strep thing.  Uh-oh.  You got that infection, that antibiotic-proof infection?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The staph thing?  Spreads.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  You got a sweaty jock laying around your apartment?  That's how you get the staph.  From the sweaty jock?  Yeah.  Tell the mothers out there, watch out for the sweaty jocks in your schools.  Not even a jockstrap just has a sweaty jock from school. 
[00:09:00]  How you doing?  If your kid has one of those sweaty jocks just hanging and sweating and tripping, get  rid of it.  It's causing staph.  Would kids leave that laying around for their moms?  Look, I don't have kids, you know, but my sister does, my brothers do, and they're  freaked out a little bit about the staph thing because it's popping up in all the  schools, and I read a little about it.  The beauty of doing a radio show, you don't have to read a lot about things, you just  read a little bit to be informed. 
[00:09:30]  And what I know about that is it's caused by a sweaty jock.  That's all I know.  A sweaty jock hanging in a locker room is causing the staph.  Like, I would guess if you're in school and you got a sweaty jock, you got to bring it  home to mommy to wash.  I played sports.  Kind of disgusting.  My entire life, and I remember the first time a coach came up to the team and handed  out the jocks, kind of like in the Bad News Bears.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  And I had nothing at that age, so I'm like, what am I going to do with this?  Don't need it.  It's just so embarrassing.  It's like you're wearing a big diaper.  And then, yeah, looks like you're, yeah.  Then your mom and dad would be like, can you put your jock on today?  Stop.  And you just want to still be a little kid, so I never put my jock on.  Because it's just, it's a focal point right there.  Yeah.  Like, there's nothing else to it.  Even underwear or briefs or boxers has like an elastic band that goes around your waist 
[00:10:30]  and maybe around your legs.  It's got side panels to it or something.  And that's just like, here it is.  Here's your jock.  Wash this, mom.  My junk's been in it all day.  I just did not like wearing the jock.  It's disgusting.  I'll take a hit to the, you know, to the sensitive area every once in a while.  If I have to.  I just never liked the, it was just awkward.  My coach used to test you with a bat.  Very light, not hard.  Wow. 
[00:11:00]  See, that's.  A little tap with a bat.  If you knew it was coming, so you'd have to wear it.  Yeah, but.  Wow.  What if someone wasn't?  Yeah.  They wouldn't let you test it.  They'd go, all right, forget it.  I'm not wearing it.  And then he would ask you to go back in the locker room and he would help you put your  jock on.  Get your jock back on.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  So to the parents out there, watch out for the sweaty jocks.  Yeah.  You don't want to get.  Because of staff.  You don't want to get the staff.  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, Brian. 
[00:11:30]  Make up some stuff Tuesday.  Tom Brady has been suspended for eight games for testing positive for steroids and two  forms of human growth hormone.  Ah.  Ah, look at that.  Six games.  Yeah, eight's a little much.  Yeah, eight's a little too much.  Maybe we got to do like four to six games.  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's not a bad one.  Bad to go.  That's like good enough where people.  We got a lot of people.  People could believe it.  We got a lot of people listening in Boston now.  Yeah.  So you're in on the gag. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Hey, I like this, Brian.  When should we break that one?  Seven o'clock.  Seven o'clock?  Brian, can you call?  Well, no, no.  You can't call at this point because we now have to make it sound like, wow, you know,  been talking about this all morning.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Tom Brady.  Look, we're working out on the air.  Let's see if this is believable.  Tom Brady suspended for how many you think?  How many games?  I'd say five games for, and I know the temptation is to do an even number, but I would say five 
[00:12:30]  games for-  Because when people make stuff up, they always go with an even number.  You're right.  Human growth hormones.  Yeah.  I like that.  Human growth hormones.  That's so vague.  Human growth hormones.  It's very vague.  That's positive.  It could be anything.  It's like orange juice, I think, is considered that.  And horse tranquilizer.  Yeah, right.  Anywhere in between.  It runs the gamut.  All right.  Wait, human growth hormones?  Yes, human growth hormones.  Human-  And we're certain steroids, whatever you want.  No, let's just go with it.  I like it.  Let's see.  Who's going to believe Brady's on steroids?  Nobody. 
[00:13:00]  That's what's coming in over here.  Suspended for-  Yeah, you watch what happens.  You watch.  You watch.  This is the beauty.  See, we're talking to a lot of faithful listeners.  They will listen to all three hours of this show.  Right.  We're going to get the people that are waking up at seven.  Yeah.  You watch.  That'll teach them.  Suspended for five games for testing positive for-  I would say human growth hormones, yeah.  But testing positive?  Yeah.  I'm writing a press release.  Yes.  Yeah.  Suspended for five games for testing positive-  Testing positive. 
[00:13:30]  Testing positive for human growth hormones.  Hormones.  Is it wrong for us to make fun of Pat Sajak's car accident?  What happened?  What happened?  We made that up.  That's good.  That's what-  Oh my God.  See, you got us.  All right, let's do a little trickery.  We'll throw both of those out there.  Pat Sajak.  That's like, who cares, first of all?  That's the beauty of it.  You have to do this.  Pat Sajak, you can't not love him, was arrested with a duffel bag full of pornography from Thailand 
[00:14:00]  drunk driving.  That can't be.  Putting in Cincinnati's red hat.  He got into an accident and pornography and cocaine poured out of his trunk.  What happened to Pat Sajak in the car accident?  He lost all of his teeth.  And, uh, well, no, wait.  He, uh, he's, he's, he was de-limbed.  Yeah, yeah.  Something about, they're still trying, we're trying to get news if he, or they're trying 
[00:14:30]  to reattach his leg.  He's in surgery.  Pat Sajak, car accident.  He lost one, and the other one they're trying to reattach.  Yeah.  And he's quoted as saying, I just want to hop once more.  I'm getting the quote.  Pat Sajak, car accident, trying to save the leg.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Gotta keep it vague.  They're, uh, trying to save the leg.  Trying to save the leg.  And, uh.  See, this make stuff up Tuesday can be good every week.  How they're gonna, uh.  The leg.  Okay, good.  How this is gonna affect his career on Wheel of Fortune. 
[00:15:00]  All right, so, so we got sports, we got entertainment.  I think we really, uh, throw some trickery out there.  We need just a basic news story now.  Like, um.  Well, someone's suggesting Hillary drops out of the presidential race.  That's, that's too crazy.  I will say that for next week.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Brian, good job.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right, hey, Chris in Boston's gonna help us out.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, not much.  I just wanted to add, uh, if you're gonna go with the Brady thing, you gotta, you gotta  word it right, you know.  They always write in the paper, you know, that someone's been, uh, suspended, you know, 
[00:15:30]  for violating the substance abuse policy.  Suspended for, uh, five games.  Violating the substance abuse policy.  I like that.  Violating substance abuse policy.  By taking human growth hormones.  Possibly, yes.  Possibly tied to the use of human growth hormones, because we gotta throw that in.  Yeah.  Dan, can you write this out as a...  That's a good one.  As a story.  They're pretty vague, but, you know, they always throw in their, you know, substance 
[00:16:00]  abuse policy or, you know, some other form.  And see, you know, you gotta make it sound right.  That's all.  See, for all the people that, you know, wake up early with us, you're in on this.  Like, a lot of people, they're big fans of the show, but they're lazy.  Their alarms go off at seven.  They're not even listening to us now.  And then we hit them hard with the Pat Sajak car accident.  We hit them hard with the Tom Brady thing.  Yeah.  And we hit them hard with maybe one other story.  And out of these three, they're gonna believe one of them, big time.  Yep.  And one will take off.  You confuse them a little bit.  And then we're gonna throw some real news in there as well. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Like the space shuttle coming back to Earth tomorrow.  You know, you throw a little at it.  The real news in the Oprah running a brothel in Africa.  Yeah.  Oprah Winfrey's Bunny Ranch over there in Africa.  God almighty, Oprah.  All right, hold on.  It's such a sexy school.  Hold on.  They're helping us with our story.  Vinny and Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, if you do the Brady story.  The rule is, it's the first time offense is automatically four games.  And like the previous guy said, it's gonna be pretty vague. 
[00:17:00]  They will not get into details on what the exact violation is.  But it's automatic four-game suspension.  Okay, four games.  All right, make sure you write automatic four-game suspension for first offense there, Thane.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Fit that in somehow.  Okay.  See that?  Sorry, we can't go with the odd number, Jim.  You gotta go with the realism.  Yeah, because that'll, you know, there's some sports fans out there go,  Ah, this is BS.  Yes, everyone knows it's four games, not five games.  No comments yet from any people.  That'll be a little...  No, the key to this is...  Yeah, keep it vague.  This is all we know at this time. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  It's very new.  It's developing.  Yep.  It's developing as you wake up.  Yeah.  See, it's the first thing you hear and you go, what?  What?  You know how that goes.  You wake up and you go, Robert Goulet died.  Huh?  It just hits you like, what?  The news of the day.  What happened while you were snoozing?  You don't even care about Robert Goulet, but they hit you between the eyes and you have  to be affected for a minute or two.  That's how it works.  Robert Goulet died?  What?  Mula?  The fabulous Mula died? 
[00:18:00]  She's dead?  Which is true, by the way.  You can look that up for yourself, but the first lady of wrestling, and I think they  used the term lady very loosely.  First lady of wrestling.  84, she died.  The fabulous Mula.  Yeah.  What'd she die of?  Huh?  Old age or...  Oh, wait.  It's now...  Had to be.  She was friggin' ancient.  Jeff in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Has the hotline from BCN rang because they have a quote-unquote flagship station for the  past, so just a word of warning.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Is the Tom Brady story going to get us in trouble?  Well, BCN does carry the past game.  And we're being hurt on that fine station.  It's our segment.  We're admitting now that it's a pack of lies before we do it.  It makes stuff up.  Of course it's not.  We're not even saying allegedly.  This is complete fabrication.  We are lying.  It's drivel.  We're making this up.  We're wishing it was true.  So we're okay with this?  Of course.  All right.  What's BCN going to do about it?  All right.  No need to get panties in a twist.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  McLean in Tennessee. 
[00:19:00]  What's up, McLean?  Hey, Opie.  Don't be taking this staph infection rightly, man.  I've been fighting this thing for three months.  I'm a deputy sheriff here in Tennessee.  And it starts out like a spider bite or a little bump on you.  I've been fighting for three months.  And it sucks.  I've been through four or five antibiotic shots.  I've been through two rounds of antibiotics.  You got a sweaty jock?  Yeah.  We just...  Huh?  It's not duty issues.  No sweaty jock for me, guys.  Would you touch a nasty perp? 
[00:19:30]  Well, you know, that's the only way I could have picked this thing up because none of my  friends that I hang out with, nobody has that.  And I come down with this thing.  That's the only way I could have got it.  One of these maggots I deal with.  Well, let's make it perfectly clear.  I'm not making fun of it.  All I know is you get it from a sweaty jock.  Maybe there's other ways to get it.  But they're saying this started in like...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What are you...  What is that lady pulling out of the side of her face?  Iraq!  Jesus!  Darcy's spider bite. 
[00:20:00]  Look that up on you.  There's your video of the day.  Okay, I'm going to throw the F up.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He does the show rundowns.  Don't forget to put Darcy's spider bite, the video, up on onaradio.com.  Is that real?  As part of your show rundown.  There's your video of the day.  Why do you go with that?  Fake.  It's fake.  Fake.  It's fake.  Nope.  It's real.  Well, I'm getting reports that it's fake.  It's not fake.  Her boyfriend...  There's a similar video of her boyfriend doing a much worse one.  That looks like makeup. 
[00:20:30]  Nope.  It's real.  What do you mean?  What do you mean the boyfriend's doing a much worse?  Dude, that looks like makeup.  You've got spider bites and they're both doing these nasty pus extractions from their face.  Right, so it's fake.  Yeah, why would both of them have the same spider bites?  It's fake.  I'm saying it's fake.  Of course it's fake.  I need fakeness there.  They've both got spiders living in their face?  Yeah.  Does that make sense?  Come on, Steve.  Steve.  All right, now...  Steve.  What?  It doesn't have a foundry watermark on it either.  I know.  We'll get to work.  It's called Darcy's spider bite.  All right, it might be fake, it might be real. 
[00:21:00]  Whatever.  It was disgusting.  The ball constrictor on her cheek.  Yeah.  It was a pus wound.  All right, thank you, sir.  So wait, a little spider bite is how this infection starts, the staph thing starts?  Huh?  It looks like a little...  It looks like a little...  It could look like a little, um...  A little spider bite.  A little itchy thing on your hand or something.  My girlfriend has a teeny little bump on her neck.  Teeny.  She's a little blemish, but she's had it for a couple weeks, but it doesn't itch.  No, if it's a couple weeks, then...  Okay.  That just could be skin cancer.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:21:30]  Well, that's what we're rooting for.  We were laughing about it.  No joke.  You should be screened for skin cancer.  Tom Chiasano, he thinks I hate him, but I don't hate the guy.  He was the one that made me go and get tested.  And I feel much better now.  Hmm.  And I'm going to get tested every six months.  Nice.  Add moles removed.  Add mole removal.  Yeah.  Off as a Tom, yeah.  Should I have this removed?  On the back of my arm, I have this little...  Oh, boy, should you.  Oh, that's nothing.  It's not a little oval thing?  Is it changing shapes?  I don't know.  Not as we speak.  Is it itchy?  Not as we speak.  That'd be unique. 
[00:22:00]  Is it changing colors?  Is it itchy?  Does it change shape?  No, I don't think so.  Some things to look out for.  There you go.  Really?  Yeah.  I think it's okay.  I had moles removed just for beauty's sake.  Oh, I had a...  I'm going to have a couple added.  I want to be moley.  I want to be like in the 1700s.  Just pop one of those moles on your face with a wig.  I want to have skin tags added, like fat people get on their upper shoulders.  I want to get fat person's skin tags added to my cheeks and stomach to give me texture. 
[00:22:30]  You guys remember.  I walked in here.  It looked like I had dart wounds.  Yeah, yeah.  I had a bunch of moles removed.  Wasn't that when we just started back on regular radio and you were in the paper every day  and you had all these little...  No, no.  Thanks for thinking.  Band-Aids.  That's what I looked like.  No, no, but look.  I waited.  There were a few Band-Aids on you.  No, I waited for all the press to subside.  What was going on that we had that?  Because you had them and you were like, well, we're doing all this press.  I got these stupid Band-Aids on you.  There was some press going on.  Yes.  I can't remember for what.  Oh, it was...  Well, as you want to bring it up, it was when we got in a little trouble and got suspended 
[00:23:00]  from the other...  Oh, right.  Okay.  I thought we were in the clear because I'm like, okay, the press is over.  We're back to regular radio.  No one cares anymore.  They all did their story, so it's safe to do a little mole removal.  And my face looked like I got hit by a bunch of darts in my neck and my chest and everywhere  else.  And then, yeah, we got in deep trouble and we had camera crews following us around for  a week straight.  That's right.  That was lovely.  That's right.  I was just saying...  Wonderful.  Cut myself shaving.  All right.  So you don't know how you got your staph infection there, McLean, huh? 
[00:23:30]  No, I'm not.  I've got one on my arm right now.  Looks like somebody took a melon ball, a little melon ball spoon and scooped about a  quarter to my skin and just took a big chunk out right now.  It's about a quarter, maybe half inch deep, and it just won't heal.  It's a bear.  I'm telling you.  And I'm really clean.  I Purell about 15 times a night.  Oh, my God.  That's why you got it.  I was talking to my brother who's a scientist.  He said the staph infection crap is happening because the scientists have been saying for over 
[00:24:00]  10 years, do not use that crap.  Or if you do, don't overdo it because what you're doing is killing bad bacteria and good  bacteria.  Yep.  I know, but when you deal with these guys, these maggots, these scummy guys, and you  don't know what they've got, they've got stuff creeping and crawling.  You can't just not sanitize yourself.  You've got to do something.  Like what, though?  You've got to use that stuff very sparingly.  Yep.  They say they do have reports out there.  Use that stuff too much.  But you're doing yourself, you're putting yourself in danger because you're getting 
[00:24:30]  rid of the good bacteria that fights off some of these other bad bacterias like a staph  infection, possibly.  I use it after shaking 30 or 50 or 100 hands at a gig, like in between shows, I'll pee  a little bit.  That's it.  Yeah, but if this guy's, how many times a day?  Probably, and I work a 12-hour shift, and you've got to deal with so many people.  I probably use it at least 12, 15 times a night.  There you go.  In between hand washing.  But you can't just, you can't touch all these people and then not sanitize. 
[00:25:00]  You've got to, you know?  Yes, you can, sir.  Sanitize.  You have OCD.  I think that's OCD.  Like if they didn't have Purell, you'd be washing your hands compulsively.  Yeah.  Like my old manager in the department store, who I didn't realize had so many problems  that just needed to be washed away.  So many problems that just needed to be cleaned away and taken care of.  That's what that is.  All right, bro.  Well, good luck with the staph infection.  That sucks.  All right, guys.  Take care, bro.  All right, man.  Yeah, watch out for the sweaty jocks.  And watch out for the hand sanitizer. 
[00:25:30]  Don't overuse that crap.  See, we'll teach people.  You can just wash your hands, like, occasionally.  Yeah.  All right.  Look at Joe Torre in his Dodger uniform.  Nothing wrong with that.  Go.  I like to see the guy doing okay.  Good riddance.  I like to see that he's going to be just fine.  And he took Don Mattingly.  It doesn't even fit.  Huh?  Too tight.  It is.  Why is he wearing the uniform?  Because he's going to go out and bat the ball around him a little bit.  I know.  Just stop.  I love Mattingly.  Great Yankee. 
[00:26:00]  But he does look kind of retarded.  Retarded.  Donnie Baseball.  Great player.  Believe me.  Donnie Baseball.  That name was atrocious.  Well, on my paper route, the first time I ever heard of Mattingly, there was a woman I  was desperate to sleep with when I would deliver papers, and I always thought she was flirting  with me, because she would wear her robe open a little bit.  Ooh.  Yeah.  How about that?  Yeah.  And I would file her on the Rolodex and go right home.  Ooh.  Look at that.  I would imagine you would.  And she talked about Donnie Baseball.  Yeah.  All right.  Is it 160 or 150 in here? 
[00:26:30]  I can't tell.  It's really hot.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to figure out the heat.  We're going to get into some other things.  Phones are lit.  Do people know the sound they have to listen for between 7 and 7.30?  I think you got it over there.  Oh, my God.  This will take a while.  You know, I don't know why we're doing this.  You should know this by now, but we'll throw you a bone today.  This is the sound you're looking for if you want to win $1,000 between 7 and 7.30.  Hit!  This is brought to you by Povember.  O&A Buddy Rock!  That will be your cue starting at 7. 
[00:27:00]  Anytime between 7 and 7.30 when you hear that, to call 877-212-O&A to win the $1,000  that is up for grabs today on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look at Jay Leno, a stand-up guy.  They're talking to him on the news right now.  I'm sure it was taped yesterday, but he's on line with the Riders.  Big Riders strike, huh?  And hitting Hollywood hard.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  And Leno went out there and gave what?  His Riders Krispy Kreme donuts?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What a guy.  Yep.  None of these guys are going to, I don't think, cross the line, quote-unquote.  And Tina Fey here in New York is on strike as well, and we were just talking in the break.  She said she identifies herself as a writer first.  And I guess they want, I probably should know more about this than I do, but they want DVD  and internet money.  Yeah.  Residuals.  This is going to take a long time, I think, because that's impossible to figure out. 
[00:28:00]  Impossible.  It's impossible.  I know I've watched TV shows on my computer.  Like, I watched Lost, like the last season, exclusively through iTunes.  Yep.  Just downloaded it because I missed the season.  I didn't want to wait for any DVDs to come out, so I watched it all on my computer.  And I guess there's a problem with revenue as far as that goes.  Well, it says...  Well, yeah, because every time you download an episode of Lost, what is it, ABC? 
[00:28:30]  I don't know what...  Yeah.  ABC has Lost, right?  So ABC is getting some cashola.  Yeah, and I don't know.  But that wasn't part of the deal that the rumble is that.  Yeah.  Well, it says right here, Hollywood unions have long regretted their decision in the 80s  to accept a tiny percentage of home video sales, thinking that technology was untested.  The guild has vowed not to make that mistake again.  So they accepted just a very apparently a low percentage.  Because they didn't think DVDs were going to take off like they did.  They didn't know where it was going.  Home video wasn't as big in the 80s, obviously, to where it is now. 
[00:29:00]  And it's amazing how, like, the writers...  Without the writers, you don't have anything.  You really don't.  I mean, there's no shows.  There's nothing if it's not written.  And they just don't want to give them their piece.  They don't want to give them their money.  Well, now they're screwed.  They're going to have to in the end.  Yeah, I hope so.  And what was I going to say about that?  Oh, I was just reading an article about online viewing over the weekend.  And this is the year that all the networks woke up and put all their shows,  not all of them, but most of their shows online now. 
[00:29:30]  They finally woke up and realized we live in a world now where people are going to watch  their favorite show when they want to watch.  In a world.  But networks have been fighting this forever.  Like, they're trying to figure out how to get rid of the DVR and this and that.  And finally, they're embracing it.  And, you know, the networks are putting their shows online for you to view.  Finally.  You know?  Yeah.  It is convenient.  What sucks...  Remember we were talking about, you know, how is TV going to survive with the DVR movement 
[00:30:00]  where you can just fast forward through commercials?  Boy, did they figure that out or what?  Which thing are they doing?  Because I've noticed a couple, yeah.  Just all the...  You're trying to watch your favorite show and all of a sudden, like, some creature appears  at the bottom of the screen and does a twist and a move.  Roar!  Oh, God.  That's why they're doing that.  You know?  To plug their...  So annoying.  The screen is being filled up now because they know everyone's DVRing and fast forwarding.  So this is their way around it.  Where now, I think, I read an article that now, like, they're promoting movies during 
[00:30:30]  your favorite TV show.  I forgot what movie it was.  Maybe it was American Gangster or something like that.  I'm not sure.  Maybe someone can help me out.  But a very popular show.  All of a sudden, there was one of those pop-ups on the screen as you're watching your show  for American Gangster.  That's what it is.  It's a pop-up ad.  I also...  By the way, it might also be so you don't tape those because they want to make DVD money  on their shows.  So, like, you don't want to tape the imperfect copies of these stupid ads in the corner.  So you still go out and get the DVD of, like, Taxi or whatever it is.  But it's forcing people to now get their shows online because they do get a nice copy. 
[00:31:00]  You could watch Lost without some crazy pop-up happening in the corner.  I never minded the subtle ones with the logo that popped up, you know, softly and faded  out.  Now, sometimes stuff happens and you don't know what the hell it is.  Like, I've been watching...  You'd be watching a show on Fox or something and you'll just hear...  And a NASCAR goes across the bottom of the screen.  That's what I mean.  Those are the ones that drive me nuts. 
[00:31:30]  And they scare you.  They pop out of nowhere.  Because it's like a real sensitive or slow scene or whatever and all of a sudden...  NASCAR!  And just drives off.  It's a little dumb cartoon.  So we got the Rider Strike.  That is in full effect.  Yeah, I don't know exactly.  Obviously, it's not going to affect this show.  No, no, no.  No writing going on here.  What the hell is writing?  Who knows how to write around here?  All right. 
[00:32:00]  Talk to them.  I hope they get right.  The crowd noise thing is really interesting.  This is coming in today.  The big Pats-Colts game was huge.  Was huge on Sunday.  It did an amazing rating.  Obviously, the Pats still undefeated.  It was a great game.  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, a little controversy.  They're trying to figure out if the Colts were pumping in extra crowd noise in the stadium to try to mess up the Pats, obviously, because the Colts are at home.  But CBS is saying that they were pumping in the extra crowd noise. 
[00:32:30]  To make it sound, what, more exciting so people will watch?  Why was CBS pumping in crowd noise?  They pump it into their telecast, supposedly.  Why?  I guess to make it sound more exciting.  I don't want that.  We're on a laugh track.  We're on a laugh track.  You're doing your sitcoms.  But the NFL looked into it, and they're satisfied that the Colts didn't actually pump in extra crowd noise in the stadium itself, and that this was a CBS issue where they just add crowd noise to make it more exciting as you're watching from home. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I didn't realize they were doing this, but I guess this is a regular thing that they do with the football game.  God, that irritates me so much.  Why?  How much entertainment?  It's a production, you know?  But how much stimulation do we need?  Like, it's not enough to watch the game.  We have to feel like the crowd is swelling.  I don't care what the crowd is shooting themselves.  You know what it is, too?  It's so the announcer.  I think it gives the opportunity for the announcer to really, like, yell. 
[00:33:30]  Because if you hear him, he's like, and wait, there they are at the five-yard line.  And if the crowd is just kind of, he'd be talking, and it wouldn't be as exciting.  Well, the crowd isn't mic'd well.  Like, we have an example.  We have CBS here pumping in crowd noise for the big game that was this Sunday, and then  the CD skips, or whatever they were using to pump in the crowd noise skips.  You'll hear it go, and right after that, because they have to turn that off, you hear what the  actual crowd sounds like.  It'll go by really fast for, like, a second, but listen closely. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, it's a lot lower.  And it's kind of pathetic, because it was such an exciting game, but this is how the crowd  is picked up for the broadcast if they're not pumping in extra noise.  It's about like baseball.  Good pitching beats good hitting.  And when you play defenses that are quality, like the Patriots and the Colts, hard to just  put up.  Hard to put up.  That sounds like an amazing crowd, right?  Oh, huge.  And that's right.  That was a good point.  Hard to put up.  You can see him raising a little bit.  Yeah, he's got to, like, sound excited and loud. 
[00:34:30]  Because that's being pumped into his earpiece or whatever.  Stupid jocks.  Listen for when it skips.  Good numbers, but there is some good hitting out there.  Yeah, there's a lot of that going on.  Most of it coming from this Colts defense.  We start the fourth.  Jim Nance with Bill Simms.  The second and 11 for New England.  And Moss, open on the slant.  Down to the Colts.  See, that was the crowd.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[00:35:00]  The extra crowd CD or whatever, skipping.  And then, listen, it's going to stop in a second here.  Listen how lame the crowd actually is.  And Moss, open on the slant.  Down to the Colts, 42.  13-10 games starting this final quarter.  There's nothing that's sounding like a B.  Right.  And before that, it was...  That's why they do it, Jimmy.  It's annoying.  They have to enhance it because the reality is, from the broadcast booth...  It would sound like golf. 
[00:35:30]  While we're here, the team is at the 40-yard line.  I think that's kind of interesting.  Let's go back to it.  The second and 11 for New England.  They're pumping that in.  Listen to that.  CD skips.  And Moss, open on the slant.  Down to the Colts, 42.  13-10 games starting this final quarter.  And it's just nothing.  And then he lowered his voice.  Yeah.  Then it was just nothing.  Just another way of just making something phony.  It's like, I don't need that when I watch football.  I've never went to watch a game and went, well, the crowd's not pepped up. 
[00:36:00]  I better go home.  Yeah.  Just watch it.  When something is really happening and the crowd goes wild, that makes it that much better.  You ever see, especially in baseball, when you're talking like a clutch play and the crowd is standing and going crazy?  That's exciting.  Yeah.  And I think they're trying to fake that just to get people pumped up about the game.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  What disgusts me about it is it's the same as a laugh track. 
[00:36:30]  It's gross.  It is, we're going to tell you what the reaction should be.  How about just allowing a natural reaction from whatever it is you're showing?  How about you don't put laugh tracks in sitcoms or crowd swelling noises?  Let people just react how they're reacting.  We don't need that to enjoy the game.  We've had fun with that over the years where we play the laugh tracks after really bad jokes.  I mean, actual TV shows.  Why would a crowd laugh this hard over this dumb line?  They wouldn't. 
[00:37:00]  Here's the official explanation.  The Colts contend the debate about the decibel level in the RCA Dome is merely noise, and now they have the NFL taking their side.  A day after some unusual sounds were heard during the Colts-Patriots broadcast, that's what we just played for you guys,  the NFL issued a statement saying what sounded like simulated crowd noise was actually created by the CBS production crew, not the Colts.  So that wasn't being heard in the stadium, just on the broadcast.  CBS has informed us that the unusual audio moment heard by fans during the game was the result of tape feedback in the CBS production truck 
[00:37:30]  and was isolated to the CBS broadcast.  It was in no way related to any sound within the stadium and could not be heard in the stadium itself.  What, the giant crowd swell couldn't be heard in the stadium?  Then why are we hearing it at home?  Yeah.  Yeah, then why are we hearing it at home?  Why don't you just dub over the referee when he's talking and make him say funny things like America's Funniest Home Video?  Yeah, and put in sound effects like boing when someone gets hit.  It's just another way that Americans just need things spoon-fed to them. 
[00:38:00]  It's annoying.  Bunch of dopes.  Need hyper-stimulation.  This is a good, I remember this.  Duncan, Rhode Island, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I don't know if you remember a couple years back, CBS got caught piping in bird chirps on golf broadcast as well.  Yeah, that was a big story during golf.  That's a good Brian Regan bit, too.  You know how they got caught?  So you watch?  That's not me, or he sued?  Well, sorry.  The golf.  I didn't really need an answer. 
[00:38:30]  I was just going for a set up there.  I know, but I could have used some crowd noise pumped in after my awful joke.  Oh, wait, hold on.  Say it again, Jimmy.  What?  How did they know?  Did the bird sue?  Wow, you're killing.  Jimmy, you're killing on the show.  I stand corrected.  I like it.  See, that was funny, too, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I'll bet the bird got a lawyer.  Uh-oh.  Is that being piped? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, no.  Jimmy, you phony.  I know.  People were really laughing, guys.  I saw their faces.  How they got caught.  So they got bird noises during a golf telecast, whatever.  Some bird enthusiast, like watching from some out-of-the-way place, recognized the bird sound  and said that it's impossible that this bird actually lives in this location where the golf  tournament was going on.  It's impossible.  And then all of a sudden went on his computer and started angrily typing. 
[00:39:30]  How dare you?  He knew the bird call was not indigenous.  Indigenous.  That's what I was looking for.  Right.  To that golf course.  Right, right.  Come on.  We got the Brian Regan bit.  We should play this going in.  Imagine your whole thing is taken down by a bird enthusiast.  He kind of likes birds and golf.  What a fun hang he must be.  When I was watching golf, I noticed my other hobby, bird enthusiasm. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Signed, T. Chiasano.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Tom likes birds and golf.  Tom probably called in.  Tom's a different case, though.  I mean, he's like a...  Oh, God.  Oh, it's hard to fall asleep, everybody.  Yes, Tom.  Yes, Tom.  Here's one of the issues with football.  Yeah.  Is the companies are afraid to wire the crowds now.  They used to have these mics sitting down in the crowd.  Because they were causing the crowd noise. 
[00:40:30]  Of course, they're worried about picking up ambient cursing.  Oh.  Well, you know something?  That makes a lot more sense.  I don't like it at all.  I think it's stupid.  But at least it makes more sense.  But back in the day...  They're not liking the crowd.  Not like they used to.  You kind of would hear that.  I kind of remember.  Back in the day, it would be hilarious.  And the announcer would have...  You'd have to make like it didn't happen.  Oh, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.  That's true.  Wow.  Yeah, you don't hear that anymore.  Okay, so...  So every football game you watch on TV, for the most part, that...  Is it all piped in, then? 
[00:41:00]  Most of it.  No, I don't think so, but it's just...  No, no, but a big percentage, because we just heard what happens when the CD stopped,  and it was very low in the background.  No, no, no, no, no.  Most of the sounds you hear, crowd-wise, when you watch a game, is pumped in now.  All right, that makes sense.  And I do like birds, and I do like golf.  I don't...  Birds, I enjoy more than golf.  I just...  Why do you like birds?  Yeah.  They just kind of look at you.  They dinosaurs.  They hate you.  I don't know.  Believe me, 3 million years ago, they just would have pecked at your face. 
[00:41:30]  Right, eating you.  They're not nice.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you, Tom?  Little dinosaurs in your house.  So, would you recognize the sound of a bird that wasn't indigenous to your golf course?  No.  All right.  No?  Anytime you say...  There's hope for you.  That bird sound is not indigenous with, a gunshot should just be me out.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That's funny.  Thank you, Tom.  So they had to fess up because of some nerd?  Yeah.  That they... 
[00:42:00]  I think Brian Reagan talks about this in this bit.  He's going to be part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Well, that's starting out quite in a couple days.  Tom notices people from certain economic groups that aren't indigenous to his golf course.  Oh, boy, does he.  Doesn't want to openly admit it, but he notices.  It's right.  It's like they pump in white people talking.  It doesn't sound like they mix.  Ground out all those black and Spanish voices with a, hey, how are you?  Good game?  All right.  Here we go.  We'll go to break with a Brian Regan bit.  Brian. 
[00:42:30]  It's quick.  I think it's pretty much what we were just talking about.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I like watching golf on TV.  And I read recently, this is true, NBC Sports, on their golf telecast, they got caught putting  in bird noises for ambiance.  Birds aren't even there.  And a bird lover called him on it because he was hearing a bird that was not indigenous  to where the tournament was being held.  Wow.  Can you imagine being the guy who had to field that phone call? 
[00:43:00]  Uh, yeah, sports department.  Uh, yeah, hi.  Listen, uh, does this sound right to you?  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  No, that don't.  Um, I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah, apparently you don't.  Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to believe the blue-breasted whippoorwillow has decided to alter its annual 
[00:43:30]  migratory route to enjoy a little golf.  Whistling.  Whistling.  What?  Maybe for that region you should try...  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Okay.  I get it.  I got one.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling. 
[00:44:00]  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  Whistling.  You have to admire that guy.  You have to admire him. You're not going to slip a chirp past him.  What the hell was that?  Please tell me I did not just hear that.  Please, please tell me this is not happening to me today.  I wish he would have handled it differently.  I wish instead of calling, he would have snuck in there late at night,  pulled out that bird tape, you know, stuck in another animal track. 
[00:44:30]  No one would even know until it's going out live.  Ernie Ells is looking at about a 10-foot putt here.  This is a downhill putt.  It's going to break a little bit to his left. 
[00:45:00]  Man, he is focused!  Ah, good morning.  Contest is on between now and 7.30.  I hope you know what to do.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  What is America talking about today, Anthony?  Well, this one, huge news for Boston, especially.  New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady suspended four games 
[00:45:30]  for violating the NFL's steroid and related substance policy,  according to reports on ESPN.com.  That's giant.  Undefeated, suspended four games.  Citing an anonymous source, ESPN is reporting that Brady's positive test  resulted from taking supplements.  His A sample came back positive last week,  and per the drug policy, Brady exercised the right to have his B sample tested  on Monday.  A league source told ESPN that Brady's likely to appeal the suspension, 
[00:46:00]  but yeah, this one just coming in.  Tom Brady suspended for four games in the middle of one of their best seasons.  Undefeated season.  Undefeated.  Unbelievable.  As soon as we get more info, we'll pass that along to you.  Also, out of Hollywood, Pat Sajak, car accident.  Yeah, looking...  That's all we know so far.  They are saying they're trying to save his leg.  Looking a little more grim as they get more news in.  I guess he's in surgery right now, and they're trying to save his leg. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  As opposed to just getting him a chair in that stupid show.  You don't like that show anymore, Jimmy?  I like it.  I like how Vanna just kind of, like, touches letters now.  She doesn't even turn them over.  Yeah.  Her job has been taken away, but she still stands there looking all goofy.  And yet, a true hero like Zoe Coplitz is being...  What?  Zoe Coplitz.  What?  Just...  I'm sorry, Coplowitz.  Coplowitz.  Oh, yeah.  The marathon... 
[00:47:00]  Coplowitz.  I think they know Zoe in Boston as well, for all the people listening on BCN, because  I think she runs the Boston...  Runs.  I think she slowly walks the Boston Marathon as well.  New York City Marathon, of course, ended about two and a half days ago.  Oh, but not for Zoe.  No.  Not for Zoe.  You go, Zoe.  You go, girl.  You bring us all up.  She, uh...  Can I get some officer and gentleman for Zoe?  Her time was 28 hours, 45 minutes. 
[00:47:30]  What?  She has MS.  She has MS.  And, uh...  This is her 20th New York City Marathon, by the way.  Yeah, correct.  Can I just jump in here?  Yes.  Jimmy and I were talking about this during the break.  We both hate Zoe Coplitz.  And there's no reason to hate her.  She has MS.  Of course.  She's got crutches.  And every year, she decides that she's going to be the last person across the finish line 
[00:48:00]  at the New York City Marathon.  They actually have to keep the finish line up a good day and a half, more than they want  to, because Zoe is still on the course.  Just so she can be last.  And I know it's wrong to hate someone with MS.  I understand that.  But I can't help it.  I hate this woman.  I'll tell you why.  Because she has a fat head.  There's something about her head.  It's just...  It's enraging.  It's her head.  Big Fred Flintstone head.  And she's a slowpoke.  I don't like... 
[00:48:30]  A slowpoke.  No one likes a slowpoke.  I think she's an attention seeker.  And that's why it bothers me.  You see these inspirational stories during sporting events where, you know, the guy that  lost both his legs.  I guarantee there was a guy in the New York City Marathon, lost both his legs fighting  for this country in Iraq, and you don't see that in the paper today.  Zoe gets all the attention.  I think that's why it bothers me.  I think if you do it one time, you got the MS, and you decide, you know, I'm going to do 
[00:49:00]  something special.  I'm going to walk the New York City Marathon.  Should be an inspiration for a lot of people that have MS out there.  I'm with you.  I'm still with you right there.  But year after year after year, I have no doubt in my mind that she is probably slowing  down during the race because she knows there's people behind her.  Because she has to be last to get that attention.  Congratulations, Zoe.  You lost again.  Congratulations.  What I would rather read about the guys, you know, that, you know, two fake legs running  the New York City Marathon, you know, something horrific happened to them over in Iraq and 
[00:49:30]  decide this is what I'm going to do to show people what you can accomplish with the fake  limbs and stuff, even after a horrific tragedy.  Stupid Zoe.  I don't like this woman, and I know it is just not PC, but she bothers me every year.  I saw her on the news, and the newscasters, they make believe they don't even know the  woman.  You know who she is.  You know this happens every year.  Why doesn't someone do a story on the fact that she does this every year?  Here's why I hate her. 
[00:50:00]  I just figured it out.  She looks like the lady in planes, trains, and automobiles who worked at the auto counter.  Oh, Murray, you're a stench.  She's on the phone as Steve Martin is trying to, like, get a flight, right?  Yeah, you can't like her face.  God, she looks just like her.  She looks like three different Chris Farley characters with that face and that dumb, awful  wig do.  And she looks like she should twist her ears and take her head off, and Arnold Schwarzenegger  should be under there. 
[00:50:30]  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  How long did it take to run the marathon?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Let's go to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey, Brian.  My aunt has MS, and it's not going to go the way you think it is.  I believe you should hate this woman, because I remember as a little pinch.  Wait, wait, wait.  Time out.  You got me good, because it says mom has MS.  Opie is wrong about hating this woman.  Well, no, no.  You should hate this woman, is what I'm saying. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, okay.  Before I called, you said, you know, you shouldn't hate this woman, but you do, you know?  My aunt has MS.  When we were younger, my mother used to let her drive us around.  It was insane.  I don't know how she even drove.  She didn't have those controls on the steering wheel or nothing like that.  She used to just pick up her knee and put it on the gas pedal.  It was insane.  I thought we were going to all die.  You know?  I mean, and my aunt is just a...  I don't know if you can still use this word.  Do she?  Yeah, do she can.  Yeah.  And especially for your aunt.  She can always slow down and hit the brakes if something really slow is moving. 
[00:51:30]  Like if a yak was on its hands and knees crawling, she could avoid it.  Hands?  Yak hands?  Yes.  Look, I'll be the first...  Delicacy.  I'll be the first to admit that this is wrong to hate a woman like this, but I just do.  We don't mind showing you the ugly side of our personalities on this radio show.  She bothers me every year with her crutches, you know, going across the finish line two  days after everybody else.  And she gets more attention than guys that have real stories out there. 
[00:52:00]  Guys and girls that have real stories out there.  I know who she looks like.  Okay.  E-Rock.  I believe you.  Zoe looks like E-Rock with different hair.  Look at him behind.  Like Mr. Potato Head.  Oh my God, yeah.  The same blue eyes.  Look up, E-Rock.  Let me see those baby blues.  That's who she looks like.  She bothers us because she looks like E-Rock and she's faster.  She's Z-Rock.  One last thing, guys.  I guess she's doing her job, though, because I was watching the news yesterday and they're  like, and we'll tell you who was the last to finish the New York City Marathon. 
[00:52:30]  And I went to myself, Zoe.  I wish.  Zoe again.  I wish somebody would just wait and be slower than her.  Well, I guarantee she slows down because her thing is to be last every year.  And if it's your thing to be last every year, then are you really doing anything that special?  Well, who could be slower, really?  I mean, who, like, unless it's so obvious, she's putting along at 0.9 miles an hour.  They also showed Katie Holmes because they made a big deal about Katie Holmes, you know,  running the New York City Marathon.  They got footage of her using an iPod or some kind of iPod device, which is illegal now. 
[00:53:00]  They banned the using of iPods and earbuds to listen to music during the New York City Marathon.  But she was allowed to do it.  Why?  What was the reasoning behind that?  Because I guess it takes away from it being a sport where you're just kind of out for a  leisurely stroll.  This is supposed to be like an athletic competition.  Yeah, well, there's a lot of Kenyans.  Yeah, I mean, why do they care?  Maybe she, for her, they don't want to be bothered with people talking to her because 
[00:53:30]  they'd be bothering her.  And the other thing, because they made a big deal about her running the thing because  she's famous, she was, they have footage of her walking.  Yeah.  As soon as you start walking more than a couple hundred yards during a marathon, they should  kick you off the course.  Kick you off.  They should.  I was a runner back in the day.  There's a lot of real runners that train their asses off.  They're not getting the attention of, like Katie Holmes did, they're not getting the attention  of Zoe.  You know, you got our boys that I guaranteed were running with fake limbs.  Where are their inspirational stories?  I'd rather read about that. 
[00:54:00]  I know it's wrong to hate some lady that's just, no, it's not, it's right.  Crutching her way year after year across the freaking finish line.  Love you guys.  Love you.  She does it in under a day.  I'll respect her.  She said she shaved a half hour off of last year's time.  How have you dropped 20 pounds?  It's amazing.  MS, it stands for my snacks.  She can't stop shoveling them in her fat face.  For someone that's, quote, run 20 New York City marathons, boy.  She looks awful.  Is that the only movement she does all year? 
[00:54:30]  She sits in a chair and eats all year and then just gets up and walks for 28 hours and  then sits back down.  That's what her name was.  Edie McClurg.  Yeah.  Oh, that's it.  Edie, yes.  She's got the big Edie McClurg head.  Can we get that clip from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  Yeah, that's her.  Now that we've talked about it.  Hey, Nick, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, thanks, Nick.  Yeah, you guys got to be pulling my leg about this Tom Brady thing.  We just read the AP story.  We're going to have more as the morning goes on here.  All we know is Tom Brady suspended for four games by the NFL, and when we get more info, 
[00:55:00]  we'll pass it along to you guys.  And the only leg we're pulling is Zoe's.  Yeah.  We're going to pull that twisted, useless appendage.  Turnip.  In other news, this Oprah thing, I've got to be honest, I'm not following the Oprah thing.  I hear it's pretty ugly.  Oh, boy.  What do we got on Oprah?  Well, Oprah, you know how wonderful, like, ridiculously rich people are.  They love helping out the world, and they do that with this American mindset that just 
[00:55:30]  doesn't work in other parts of the world.  People love to think we're all the same all over the world.  We're just people.  We're all the same like a commercial for a Benetton ad or something.  No, we're not.  We're just not.  But so Oprah decides she's going to go over to Africa and build a school for underprivileged  girls.  It sounds great.  It's a great, you know, on the outside, it sounds like a fantastic idea. 
[00:56:00]  She's got a lot of money.  She does a lot of good things with her money.  Yes.  So she can go over there and build a school for these girls.  Yeah.  She does that, hops on her plane, and gets the F back to the United States of America.  You know, the nice place.  And she delegates responsibility for these girls who, quite frankly, she's responsible  for now.  You can't just make the Oprah Winfrey school, give a bunch of money, and then delegate responsibility. 
[00:56:30]  You're still like the head muckety-muck.  Well, she does.  She gets these head mistresses in there and teachers and whatnot.  And apparently, they were selling the girls for sex.  That's unbelievable.  And abusing them physically, just having people come in to, you know, have sex with them  for money, violence. 
[00:57:00]  Why would they pick those girls, by the way?  I don't know.  I guess it was a good scam for the head mistress and some of the people to make some money.  What they did was they built this place almost like a fortress.  They built a lot of very high security, big high walls.  They didn't want people because rape of young women is running rampant in Africa.  So in South Africa, where the school's built.  So they decided to build this really secure school. 
[00:57:30]  Then the parents of these girls noticed, hey, I can't get in to see my kids.  Like, I go to the school and they're running through a bunch of security and sometimes I  can't even get in.  They turn me away.  So they started investigating this and they turn up the fact that these girls are being  sexually abused from within these huge walls in security.  It's like a prison in there.  You would think this would be the safest place in Africa.  The girls told Oprah that they were told when she showed up, when Oprah would show up for 
[00:58:00]  a visit, to smile, never complain, and just talk very nicely of everybody that worked  there and the place in general.  Oprah said she's devastated because she had been a victim of sexual abuse when she was  younger.  So I don't know.  What's the difference between this and backing a clothing company that uses child labor?  Well, probably the intent.  I mean...  Yeah, the intent is sometimes people have good intent and things go bad and they wind up 
[00:58:30]  losing their jobs and everything else.  Well, do you profit?  She probably doesn't profit from this either.  I mean, I got to give it to Oprah.  You know something?  Oprah doesn't need to profit financially from anything anymore.  But there is an upside to it.  There is a great publicity side to this.  I'm not saying she's doing this with any other motive than to be nice, but she can't be as  stupid and naive as some of these Hollywood idiots are in thinking that you can go to a 
[00:59:00]  place like Africa and set up something that is in a place that is being ravaged by disease  and rape and think you're just going to set it up and it's going to be like it's somewhere  in the United States that you can just leave and everything's going to be fine.  It doesn't work that way.  I like your intelligence, but you went by disease and rape.  Disease and rape.  That's a drastic drop off.  You know what?  That's pretty much what the problems are over there in Africa. 
[00:59:30]  You know, like heart...  A little genocide thrown in.  Heart disease in America is a biggie, but in Africa it's disease or rape.  I'm not talking like heart disease or anything like that.  I'm talking wacky diseases that can't even get out of Africa.  The Ebola virus.  They kill you so fast they can't even spread.  Yeah.  That's terrible, though.  I mean, she tries to set up a...  A nice thing.  Yeah, man.  People are just such animals.  Ends up the bunny ranch.  They could have done that here, but it's probably harder to suppress information here than it  is in the United States.  She could have absolutely done it here, but she decided, being naive and silly, that she 
[01:00:00]  can go to a country...  You can't go to a third world country like that and set something up like that and then just...  It's not that she was being silly.  She was bringing attention to an area that desperately needs help.  That was her intention.  But people have said that there's a lot of people in America that could have used that  help in a lot of communities all over America.  When I say it could have happened here, I don't mean that she could have been in the school.  I mean the sexual scandal.  That kind of stuff does happen here, just not on that scale, because information gets 
[01:00:30]  out too fast.  Yeah.  And also there, for the most part, let's say, yeah, things slip through, but for the  most part, there are safety things in place here that kind of are at least there to try  to protect the kids from something, from predators.  But over there, I mean, and she said everybody was run through a rigorous investigation.  What kind of investigation can they have over there that is really going to expose people  for what their backgrounds are? 
[01:01:00]  There's so much corruption going on over there.  A lot of times, like what was happening in Somalia, that we're flying food in.  The Red Cross and UN is flying food in like crazy, and people are going, why are they  still starving?  Because the warlords would grab all the food, sell it to make money, and not give any to  the people that are starving.  It's just, it's a whole nother...  At least they're trying.  It's a whole nother world over there.  You can't do it the way that she thinks it can be done. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  It can't happen that way.  She's saying this is the worst thing that has ever happened to her in her life, by the  way.  She's pretty distraught, to the point where she gave out cell phones to all the students  over there.  Yeah, she said that.  All the girls at the school now have cell phones with the direct number to Oprah Winfrey.  So if she wants, you know, if the girl's getting abused or feels that she's being threatened,  she can call up Oprah immediately.  That's right.  And in 26 or 27 hours, Oprah can be there. 
[01:02:00]  Yes, that won't be annoying to get calls all hours.  I'll enjoy dinner.  All right, I get it.  Oprah, I can't do my homework.  Yes, my pencil broke.  All right, could you leave me alone?  She's going to have, like, people fielding the calls.  But to me, it's like that's at least the way she's doing it is a real humanitarian way  to do it.  It's like when the U.S. government helps out, it's usually...  It's like they'll help out whoever's, like, the government that's kind of helping us.  It's like we're against dictators.  Yeah.  It's, you know, Pakistan, where the guy is pro-U.S. 
[01:02:30]  Well, yeah.  Poor dictators.  Forced to die when he's helping us and against them when he's not.  I just think that people like Oprah and Barbra Streisand and just, they're naive about the  world.  They think the world is just one place where everyone's this.  You know, they get this drilled in their head that everyone's the same.  You know, we're all just people under the skin and we're all this.  And, you know, just because you're raised in a different place, in different culture, 
[01:03:00]  doesn't mean we don't all enjoy laughter and children and having...  And that's just such a crock of crap.  There are places on this world that have absolutely no respect for human life, dignity, women,  children.  And that's the way it is.  And no amount of money you pour in or our pompous Western philosophies are going to stop that. 
[01:03:30]  You're just going to pump money in and these people are going to be just as vicious and animalistic  as they have been.  It's the way it is.  That's the world.  Sorry.  Oh, well, thank you.  I was not expecting the slow clap, but I always enjoy getting the slow clap.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I will be running for president of the United States of America. 
[01:04:00]  Gak, gak, gak, gak, gak, gak, gak, gak, gak.  A little reality.  That's all I'm asking these people to have.  A little reality.  Rod Paul for president.  I'm not being cynical.  I'm being a realist.  But the thing is, what can you do there?  You can't do anything.  There's places on this earth where you can't do anything.  You have to let it play out.  You just got to let it play out.  Like a good game of Monopoly.  Disease, like AIDS, genocide, civil war, rape, the killing of males. 
[01:04:30]  Can I add one?  Yes?  Ooga booga.  Ooga booga.  That too.  That is what this world has been about since people have first been here.  There are going to be pockets like that on the world.  And it's part of the grand plan.  Some people just live better than others.  In a few thousand years, who knows?  The United States might be a crap hole and we'll be go vacationing in South Africa. 
[01:05:00]  So what's the list again?  Genocide?  Yes.  Genocide.  Disease, like AIDS.  Spoiled fruit.  Rape.  Rape.  And ooga booga.  And ooga booga.  Yeah.  And that's staph infection from the jock straps.  And yeah, watch out for sweaty jocks.  Hey, let's say hi to Marjorie from Westchester.  Marjorie.  Hello.  Hi, Marjorie.  What's up?  Not much.  I'm on my way to work right now. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  And I was calling because I thought I heard the sound of the day.  Oh, yeah.  What was the sound of the day today?  I believe it was Opie and Anthony.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  I'm yelling wrong.  Wait, what?  Hold on a minute.  Let me...  Uh...  All right.  Hold on a minute.  I wasn't...  Okay.  Oh.  Bam.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  That had a...  That had a hurt.  Too bad you didn't know the actual sound. 
[01:06:00]  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Mikey.  How are you, buddy?  How are you?  All right.  So I guess that's not the sound then, huh?  What did you think the sound was?  All right.  Uh...  I love you guys.  I love you.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Uh, Brooks in Maryland.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  I thought I heard the sound too.  The sound too.  What was the sound of the day?  Uh, it sounded like, hey, you guys.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass. 
[01:06:30]  Uh, Robert Yonkers.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What's going on, Robert?  Hey, I heard the sound of the day yesterday morning and last night.  Yeah.  And?  Well, it's O&A Party Rock.  Wait, what is it?  O&A Party Rock.  Oh, you mean this?  O&A Party Rock!  So you didn't do it right.  Yeah.  When you hear that, you got to be the 10th caller.  Oh. 
[01:07:00]  So you better, oh, listen to that.  Oh.  He realizes what just happened.  Sorry.  He's one of ours, I can tell.  That's sad.  Robert, I can tell you're one of ours.  I'm sorry, man, to do that.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  I really am.  All right.  On the way, we got more reactions to Two Girls, One Cup.  We'll explain after the break for the newbies, including Bob Kelly's reaction and a one from 
[01:07:30]  six girls.  Six girls reacting to that unbelievable video.  And then we got Tyra talking about the thing.  You could say it.  The thing.  The vagina.  She did a whole show on this.  Yeah.  We've been waiting for this for about a week.  We can't wait to play some of this audio.  I don't know the context of it.  Like, why is she doing this?  Her audience are women, and they obviously are pretty familiar with it.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:08:00]  All I saw in the office, I just saw, yeah.  It was a tape, right?  It was a tape of the show, and there was a puppet, a vagina puppet that a woman was using  on her hand as Sam was editing the sound.  And I saw the video, and she had a puppet of one.  What was the puppet saying?  If I didn't exist, men would never talk to you.  What's the use?  We'll have to see.  I'm stupid.  All right.  It's also 80s, new wave, Tuesday. 
[01:08:30]  It's 80s, new wave, Tuesday.  Come on, love, let it go for me.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.  Our house in the middle of our street.  Our house in the middle of our street.  Don't you want me, baby? 
[01:09:00]  Don't you want me?  Oh.  It's 80s, new wave, Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, it's Opie and Anthony.  Let's go right to Eric in...  Looks like New Hampshire.  Eric, what's up, buddy?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Congratulations.  You won that $1,000.  I am ecstatic.  Thank you very much.  It does pay to linger longer.  Linger longer.  Are you listening on BCN or what?  Yes, I am. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, cool.  We're getting a lot of Boston winners.  What do you do in New Hampshire?  I sell software.  Oh.  I'm a phone monkey.  Exciting.  Stop.  Not so much.  Really?  Bore.  Yeah.  Eric, you now have $1,000 to go out and bore people with.  What are you going to do with $1,000?  I'm going to be nigger rich and blow it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  That's, uh...  Oh, well.  Oh, boy. 
[01:10:00]  I'm sure that, uh, didn't, uh...  Oh, boy.  Turn off the music.  Oh, boy.  My mom used to say that to me all the time.  Yeah.  And then I grew up and realized that's not a politically correct term.  Uh, it's, it's a politically incorrect term for when you have, uh, some money, some extra  money in your pocket.  Instead of putting it away in the bank and stuff, you spend it.  And it's being called a certain type of rich that he just used, uh, the, the name of.  And, uh, Eric, oh, you knew that wasn't, uh, very nice. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I knew.  I just got so excited.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Oh, did I hear that around the house, though, growing up all the time.  All right.  Oh.  Really?  Always.  You know, what am I supposed to do also?  You're a kid, and the second your birthday rolls around, you start getting, uh, cards with  ten bucks in it, five bucks in it.  And then, but what do they want you to do?  Start, like, investing in stock at seven years old? 
[01:11:00]  You want to grab the money and go out and just kind of blow it on candy and toys.  Trying to get more on the Brady, uh, suspension thing.  When we have it, we'll, uh, pass it along to you guys.  Suspended for four games.  That's, uh, what we're hearing today.  Um, hey, uh, the reaction to the two girls, one cup video is just exploding.  Yeah.  Well, well, so is the video for the newbies out there.  There's a video out there.  There's a lot of gross videos out there, but for some reason, this two girls, one cup  is all the rage on the internet. 
[01:11:30]  Not because it's something you want to watch it.  The, the rage is in people, uh, videotaping themselves watching this horrific video.  And then the reaction you get from people that, uh, watch this for the first time.  Cause it's so disturbing to watch that, uh, it's fun to watch people watching it.  Right.  And you usually get like innocent people to watch it.  Like we got, uh, six girls reacting to two girls, one cup.  And we also, we should play, uh, Robert Kelly real fast. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  We showed Robert Kelly, two girls, one cup.  This, uh, very, very disturbing video.  And this was, uh, his reaction.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, mom.  Don't, don't turn away.  Wait, mom.  You're not a fan of Carvel, are you there, mom?  Yeah.  I can't get enough of that.  The video's up on our websites. 
[01:12:30]  Uh, we got more, more from Robert Kelly as he's watching two girls, one cup.  He wasn't looking close enough.  Yeah, Bob, Bob.  Wait.  Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Help me here, man.  Man.  How could you pay to get somebody to do that?  How could you not?  He was, uh, deeply.  And we got one more from Robert Kelly watching two girls, one cup.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  Nobody's talking.  Oh, my God.  He's talking around again.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  You gotta, you gotta put the bucket underneath the screen.  He's too much, man.  I love it.  And it's truly not about the actual video anymore.  No.  It's about the reactions, uh, that, that people have watching this horrific video.  Yeah.  If you need to, uh, you know, do a search for yourself, just throw two girls, one cup into  the search engine.  Uh, this one is really funny, too. 
[01:13:30]  You got six, uh, relatively innocent girls watching the video for the first time, and this  is what happened.  This is really disgusting.  Okay, you ready?  Okay, you can press click.  Yeah.  I'm scared now.  It's like a...  I knew it was going to start off like...  Yeah, brown.  Shut the f*** up.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  That's not real.  That's definitely... 
[01:14:00]  Oh!  What country are they from?  Oh, my God.  That was like a delicate tape for that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I almost just barfed.  No!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Damn you.  She just barfed.  I just didn't see the rest.  Ew, ew, ew, ew. 
[01:14:30]  How about...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I just barfed.  Did she barfed?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing, Dad?  Ah, I hope he caught that.  They missed one?  Yeah, he certainly did.  Ah!  Make sure you got that down the hall there.  I'm sure he got it down the hall.  Everyone else.  You gotta be careful with that.  How do you miss the F word? 
[01:15:00]  It's just beyond me.  Well, we got a guy that knows what he's doing down the hall, so...  But it's still just beyond me.  I don't know.  It's like there's context, and then there's just blatant, like, someone wasn't listening.  What happened?  Who cut that up?  What's up?  Who cut that up?  Who cut it?  Who cut it up?  We know he got the dump.  Who cut it up?  Danny?  I cut it up, and I played it for Jiven.  And he didn't hear it either? 
[01:15:30]  All right.  Well, there you go.  He just saved our lives.  Thank you.  Thank you down the hall.  I was gonna hit...  Why didn't I hit it?  Why am I so friggin', like, tentative on the dump button?  It's right in front of my face, and I went like...  I think you're right.  Hit the button.  What happened?  What a fruit.  I don't know.  My mic got cut off.  What a tragedy.  Hit the damn button.  I was too busy looking at your beauty marks, and I got all confused.  I have a lot of those.  I'm covered in beauty marks. 
[01:16:00]  I want to have one, like a big port wine stain.  Look, it's my beauty mark.  It's a beauty mark.  Bernie in Boston.  What's up, Bernie?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Bernie.  How's Phil?  Bernie and Phil.  Never heard that one before.  Of course not.  Heard the reports about Brady getting suspended for four games.  What did you guys hear about that?  A whole bunch of stuff.  ESPN.com was reporting...  Citing an anonymous source, ESPN reporting that Brady's positive test results resulted from taking some supplements. 
[01:16:30]  His A sample came back positive last week.  Per the drug policy, Brady exercised the right to have his B sample tested on Monday, and as of now, looks like a four-game suspension.  It's some kind of...  ESPN.com?  Yeah, that's what...  That's what the reports said, but who knows because of that.  It's some kind of substance policy suspension.  They're not getting into...  No details, though.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rich in D.C.  Rich, what's up?  Dude, you guys got to stop playing that video or referencing it or just drop it. 
[01:17:00]  I almost puked on my suit.  I'm driving to a job interview.  I blacked out last night.  I can't do this anymore.  Puked on his suit, huh?  Well, the two girls, one cup, it's a phenomenon.  It's an internet phenomenon.  And it's not about just having the video.  No one gives a crap about posting that video anymore.  They give a crap about posting reactions to that video.  Reactions are giving me a reaction, guys.  You got to love those six girls, though.  That was the best one I've seen so far.  Holy Christ. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's go to Jay in Bayonne.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, Jay.  Dude, I almost puked when I watched that video the other day.  I was looking at that thing.  I was like, I cannot believe they posted something like this.  And I'm like, and I was going to let my wife watch it.  But I said, nah, she'll gag too.  I was gagging all over the place.  Well, if you let your wife watch it, videotape her watching it.  Oh, yeah.  I'll send it in.  Yeah, do that.  Yeah, send it in.  We'll play the better ones.  But you got to get to people that have never seen the video.  Yeah.  Because we can tell bad acting. 
[01:18:00]  And not your dopey buddies that'll just laugh.  It's also about sharing.  And my friends are saying.  Yeah.  And my friends are saying, let your kids watch it.  I'm like, yeah, I'm sick.  And I'm going to let my kids get sick.  Nah, you better not let your kids.  Oh.  That would be bad parenting.  Unless your kid is 30 years old.  And the beautiful thing is that is about sharing that video.  See, there's two girls with one cup.  Now, a lot of times people fight over that cup.  Uh-huh.  Not these two girls.  No, sharing is caring.  Whole bunch of moose.  Let's just eat the moose together. 
[01:18:30]  And then you gargle with it.  I'll gargle with it.  Everybody throws up and laughs about it.  It's sexy.  It's fun.  It teaches a lesson.  There's two girls.  There's one cup.  Well, let's take lemons and make lemonade.  Well, I'm confused.  Whatever comes from the other side.  There must be something wrong with the moose then if they're throwing up.  Because moose is very, very tasty.  Now, but moose like that is what happens is when you French kiss with two mouths full of moose.  Yeah.  And one person goes and pushes the moose back up.  Oh.  It's only natural that somebody should get sick.  And if you're going to throw up, by golly, do it right back on the moose. 
[01:19:00]  Don't waste any.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Anthony, what was the other name of the website that was reporting the Brady stuff?  You said ESPN.  I can't find anything up there.  Also, myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  Oh.  It was a whole exclusive on the Tom Brady incident.  Jimmy, everyone's trying to get their Tom Brady news right now.  All I'm saying is it's being reported by ESPN.com.  I don't know where it is on that site, if it's up yet, but that's all. 
[01:19:30]  We have like three sentences here that we got.  That's it.  Chris in Toronto, what's up?  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Hey, Chris.  If Brady gets suspended, is that automatic?  Or is that, even if he appeals, doesn't he, is it still automatic?  Sorry?  It's retroactive.  They actually have to suspend him for the last four games.  Who knows?  We don't know much.  They got a bye week anyway, right?  We told you everything we know.  Right.  So, four-game suspension. 
[01:20:00]  Jesus.  We got Tyra.  Yeah, we should play a little of this today.  Tyra.  We've been looking forward to this show for a while.  We heard the promos, that Tyra was going to talk about the vagina.  Yeah.  She's doing a whole show on it.  And, of course, her audience, all women.  And I don't know what they don't know about it, that she's got to do a whole show about it.  And I like how she thinks it's this taboo subject.  Yeah.  All you see is commercials for, like, feminine hygiene products. 
[01:20:30]  That's all you hear about on television.  Yeah.  It's not this taboo thing.  Yeah, she prefaces this whole thing by saying how mysterious it is.  And kind of, we're going to go into uncharted territory.  What?  No, you're not.  Exactly.  The phones are lit.  What a faker.  When we have more Brady info, we'll give it to you.  Why am I so aggravated today?  Huh?  Why am I so aggravated today?  I'm yelling.  I see it in your face.  Every day, I mean, everything I'm talking about, I wind up going like this. 
[01:21:00]  You're becoming a curmudgeon, a cranky old man.  Just stop it.  Yeah, what's wrong, Anthony?  I'm not cranky.  Yeah, you're a bit cranky.  You're just going to be an awful old man.  You're going to be the type that's like, fat.  You're not even going to know why you're saying it.  Am I going to shake my fist at people?  Yes.  Fat.  Yeah, I'm cranked.  I'm like, ugh.  If you had a port wine stain on half your face, wouldn't you just have the rest of your  face dyed?  And have your lighting adjusted in the house?  Comment?  Comment?  Anyone?  Have like ultraviolet lights so you look regular or whatever? 
[01:21:30]  I would just keep turning sideways like I'm looking at something.  Always.  Like, just constantly.  That wouldn't work.  Did you see my beauty mark?  Yeah, why are you cranky today?  I don't know.  I'm not, I'm just like everything, I noticed like everything I'm commenting on, I'm just  kind of raising my voice and yelling it.  I just noticed that.  Still hungover from Atlantic City?  No, not at all.  You all right?  Yeah, fine.  All right, well, here's Tyra.  We can't get enough of Tyra. 
[01:22:00]  We think she's what?  A dope.  Yeah.  Getting fat.  Phony.  Yeah, phony.  Tall with a wig.  Mm-hmm.  Hair that's not hers.  Right.  Untalented.  Good.  Devoid of anything but the vagina that she speaks of.  Narcissistic.  Yes.  Gigantic, far-headed.  She makes it all about herself in the end.  Her head, she looks like an attractive version of the Predator without his helmet.  That stupid big forehead. 
[01:22:30]  We get it.  You're bald.  She's doing a subject on the Predator's mouth.  Steve, Boston, what's up?  Hey, not much.  Hey, Steve.  How's it going, guys?  We're all right, man.  Good.  Yeah, I was just saying about the Brady thing, you know?  I can't believe you'd do that until a perfect season.  And how it really screws us is the fans.  Well, it's a weird year for the Pats.  You've got the cheating thing in the beginning of the year.  You've got this Brady thing breaking as we speak. 
[01:23:00]  And that's what I'm thinking is probably because they got away with the alleged whatever it is,  cheating, whether all the other teams were doing it, taping from the sidelines, whatever.  But I think this might be their way behind the scenes of going, okay, they got away with that.  We're going to get them on something else.  Yeah.  So four-game suspension.  Oof.  If that doesn't...  Well, that's what people are saying.  Take the wind out of their sails.  People are saying.  Take the cake.  Or the cake.  Let's get into the Tyra thing.  So here's Tyra's big introduction to the vagina show. 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  Many people felt and actually still feel that a woman's most private part of her body should be just that.  Private.  Well, yeah.  But what is everybody?  What if she want to be nude and walk on her hands forever?  Nothing?  You want...  Yeah.  You want it to walk around with party favors?  Every time she sneezes, you hear...  Yeah.  It has to be private.  We're like a civilized nation here.  What do you expect?  Exactly. 
[01:24:00]  You want them to wear it on their sleeve?  Look, Anthony's still mad.  No, no, I'm not.  Honey, why are you mad?  Why are you mad?  I'm really not.  Are you hurt?  No, I don't think you're mad.  No, I just noticed I'm yelling.  I know you're yelling again.  As you say, you're not...  So I'm not mad.  I don't think you're mad.  I was just...  I'm yelling.  I don't think you're mad at anything.  You're just aggravated today.  I'm yelling.  And I have no idea why I'm yelling.  All right.  Just going to speak in a nice radio voice. 
[01:24:30]  There you go.  Here it is.  All right.  Let's go back to Tyra.  That.  Private.  But what is everybody so afraid of?  It's just a vagina.  She sounds like Francine.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You know why?  Because she never really developed.  I think she stopped developing as a human being at around 15 or 16.  So you're saying she's slightly retarded?  I don't think she's slightly retarded, but I think she's...  I'm being serious, actually.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, you could go with the retarded joke, but what I'm... 
[01:25:00]  Well, it's not really a joke.  I think after...  Being retarded.  I think because she's been handed everything her entire life and she was a hot piece of  acid, like, I think they recruited her at, like, 16 or 17, something like that.  Yeah.  I think that she never developed anymore.  She's just...  She's stuck at being a 16 or 17-year-old.  She's immature.  No, that's retarded.  She's talking about the vagina like a little girl would.  Like a kid would.  Yeah.  She's uncomfortable.  She's immature.  She can't handle adult subject matter yet.  Listen, with that thought...  And what's with the chuckling of the audience, too? 
[01:25:30]  Because it's a bunch of...  Tee-hee.  It's a bunch of hens.  It's a vagina.  Every woman has one.  And there's all kind of commercials out there for men to help their sexual performance.  She does good voices.  All the time, right?  She does voices because she's uncomfortable talking about this because she is immature.  She's also talented, though.  And anyone that could do that many voices...  I thought it was a whole committee of people.  That was all just tiring.  It was just her. 
[01:26:00]  Maybe she can make a promo.  I don't know if she's talented enough.  Uh, maybe she just is retarded.  Yeah, I think she's retarded.  I don't like Tyra.  Tyra talks about a vagina.  Jim hates Tim's voices.  I want to remove Tim's larynx.  I love him, man.  Throw it somewhere.  He can't find it.  And he's got a new one?  And his hairdo.  I want to take his retarded boy wig and his larynx and hide them. 
[01:26:30]  In a cubby hole.  Here's Tim's latest creation for 80's New Wave Tuesday.  That's 80's New Wave Tuesday!  A week without you  Thought I'd forget  Two weeks without you  And I still haven't gotten over you yet  Big sanctions  Well, I ever wanted  Vacation 
[01:27:00]  Had us to get away  Vacation  Meant to be spent alone  You cannot die in the cloud  She drives me crazy  Like no one else  She drives me crazy  And I can help  Here comes Kenny  Come on, Kenny  Bring it home  To play poo  Baby  I don't care if Monday's blue 
[01:27:30]  Tuesday's gray  And Wednesday too  Thursday  I don't care about you  It's Friday  I'm in love  Saturday's New Wave Tuesday  On the O.B. and Anthony show  No  Well, that just came in  I love that  We don't know what to do with it  But the promos are good  Throw it out  No  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday  Shit  I did like Kenny's part, though 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  Alright  A.B. love  Love  Here's more Tyra  Opening up the vagina show  Sexual performance  We see those all the time, right?  That's Tyra  But it's taboo for a woman  To just talk about her female health  No, it isn't  No, it's not  Since when?  And I think it's time  That women have a common language  That they can speak about publicly  It's time for  A vagina dialogue  Woo!  Woo!  And that's how  And they start clapping 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  And to show you how taboo it is  There's something called  The vagina monologues  Monologues  It's not about  It's not a big secret, Tyra  It's not 1953  Yeah  No one's amazed that you have one  No one is amazed by it  What?  It does what?  Since birth  Most people know how it works  Yes  All the working parts  Well, um  Products for it are advertised constantly  You can't walk to a farm  There's a whole aisle  Dedicated to it  Well, here's  What are you going to hear after the break? 
[01:29:00]  Tyra embarrasses a girl  Who has never looked at her own  You know what?  Brings her up on stage  And humiliates her  With a doctor present  Very good  Tyra Kinsey  Doctor Tyra Kinsey  You got a girl  With a heavy flow  That is disgust  Are you allowed to say that?  I don't know  Are you allowed to?  Yes  I don't know  Are you allowed to say what I'm saying?  We're trying to handle this  With a little decorum  Well, I'm being very careful  I don't know 
[01:29:30]  And then you got  Tyra's four-pronged attack  Of the cramp  And then the final question  She explores  Does that area  Look and  Well, how can I say it?  It'll look different after birth  Oh, okay  Yeah, well  The body goes through changes  The stomach everywhere  Certainly  All right  All on the way  With the Opie and Anthony show  Oh, what's the sound for tomorrow?  Oh, Christ on a pony  I don't have it  Well, these people are waiting 
[01:30:00]  For the sound  They have to listen for  Between 7 and 7.30  They want to come back  We don't have to  So we can think about it  In the break  But Jimmy, why don't you pick a sound?

[01:33:00]  I don't even know  It's Opie and Anthony  We're in the middle of the tyrant thing  The tyrant thing  Also Danny ran something in  It's kind of funny  It's kind of quick  A nervous cop  Is frisking  Some dude  And then kind of  Asked him  What's this  And then  The perp had to tell him  What it was  And 
[01:33:30]  That's your penis  Alright  Sorry about that  Sorry about that  Oh god  Yuck  What's that 
[01:34:00]  At least he apologized  Yeah  God the guy must have  You know  The guy's used to it  Probably very proud  Imagine the cop  You lucky fella  He's probably thinking to himself  That's uh  Really  Searching the guy's socks  For an extra pistol  Right  Wow  Wow  You're a lucky fella there sir  Alright  In other news  You know  Cause we try to  Try to be informed  Britney Spears  Blackout number one  Does anyone care  I think it's terrific 
[01:34:30]  Her album's number one  Sold 325,000  The Hollywood writer's strike  We talked about that  This is gonna get ugly huh  This is how  Roland just walked in  And was telling us  Wow everyone is just  Walking off set  You know as the hours  Go by here  I don't understand  What the big companies  Have to gain  It's almost like  They say they could  Lose over a billion dollars  And they still don't  Want to give them  What they want  It's  It's  It's mind boggling  And I think that  The writers want  I don't know what  Percentage they want  But it's like  How can you expect  To not give a percentage 
[01:35:00]  To the people  That wrote it  Yeah Roland  What do you know  On the writer's strike  Um  It could be  Short or it could be  Pretty long  Like months  It could be what  It could be short  Like a few weeks  Or it could be  45 months  No it could be short  But what I'm saying  Is  So it could be short  Or long  Long  But I'm saying  What is exactly  That they want  It's between  In and out  All these  Um  Distribution  Of like  If it's on iTunes  Or if it's on  Like audible.com  How much do they get  Audible.com  Audible  You have the weirdest  Accent  I know  And also  They want  Some of them 
[01:35:30]  Want the reality show  Writers to become  WGA members  So when they do  Strike  If they strike again  Everybody strikes  Not just  Them  Oh cause the reality show  They're a little bit worried  Yeah  They're not WGA huh  No  Yeah cause that's everyone  They're freelance  Well are they  The only problem I have  With unions when they strike  Maybe they will do this  Will they just put them  Cause I remember  A friend of mine  When there was  Some kind of a  SAG strike years ago  Went into audition  I think it was either  SAG or after  I don't remember  What strike it was  And there's people  Picketing  And they're like  Don't cross the line 
[01:36:00]  To audition  And he goes  Okay I'm not a member  Of the union  Make me a member  Of the union right now  And I will not do  This audition  Let me join the union  And I'll join  And I will not do  Auditions  They're like  Well we can't do it  He's like  Well then why  Wouldn't I go on  This audition  It's like  Either make me  A member right now  And I will honor  What you're doing  So that's  Hopefully they'll  Do it like that  Yeah cause in 88  Johnny Carson was like  The only late night show  That ever went on the air  During the strike  Cause he was powerful  Now there's not really  That one show  That has that much power  Did he go on  During the strike  Yeah  Oh his writers  Must have loved him for that 
[01:36:30]  Yeah well but nobody  Said anything to him  Cause he had all that power  Johnny Carson yeah  Doesn't matter  It's like he's still  Got guys  I mean he can always  Replace the writers  Well like Letterman  Technically owns his show  And his studio  But he's not going on air yet  Is he gonna support the strike  Yeah  That's why  I think the biggest  Problem with this is  We know how it is  To deal with  Internet  And companies  That don't really  Understand it fully  And the money  That's involved  It takes so long  To even hammer out  A deal  Like the writers 
[01:37:00]  Want a piece of the  Internet and DVD  But to even get  Started on that  To negotiate something  Even if they agreed  In principle on something  Just the paperwork  The logistics  To figure that out  Will take so long  Well couldn't they go back  To work on good faith  Like if they got  Oh yeah  Maybe  But I mean  Ellen walked out yesterday  So  Did she dance out  No  Yeah  She should be dancing  Out of her  Dancing on the picket line  Yeah John Stewart's 
[01:37:30]  Paid two weeks  For his staff  Out of his pocket now  What a guy  What do you mean  He paid them two weeks  He's paying them  Out their salary  Out of his pocket  For the next two weeks  Are they working  Isn't there a fund  Or something  Oh they are striking  Isn't there a strike fund  When you belong to a union  Like you strike  And you get paid  For a certain amount  You gotta be good  To your writers  I don't even know  I think someone said that  When you look at the honeymoon  It was like  The writing was so brilliant  I mean that's what makes  The show either stand up  Or not it's how  The actors yeah  But without the lines  Yeah  The network should just  Force these shows 
[01:38:00]  To continue production  Without writers  Yeah  How much fun  Would that be to watch  Screw reality  In reality shows  You get like  Just a brilliant show  Like The Office  Or whatever  And just  Just make them  Just make them do something  That would be hilarious  Wow  Lenny was funny yesterday  He was passing out donuts  And there's chemical around him  He goes  I'm not funny  I need my writers back  I'm not funny  I need my writers back  Yeah you have to  You can't screw the writers  Lenny was just  Such a cool guy 
[01:38:30]  You could just tell  But they all know  Because they have to  Pump out so much material  Right  You know  It's like these guys  Are writing him like  You know  Six minutes a night  That's a lot  That's 30 minutes  Of network friendly material  A week  That's a lot  Plus the sketches  And all that crap  Sure  Alright Roland  Thanks for  Roland's a liar  No  Thanks Roland  What then  What then  The update on the  John Stewart thing  Is that that was denied  By his rep  Oh really  So you're just  Spreading rumors  What else Roland  Roland 
[01:39:00]  I heard some of the  Writers have surfed down  The wreckage  Of the building  And ended up  Fine  It's not nice to  Start rumors  You know that  I know  It wasn't a rumor  You had the wrong  Information  You sound like  A real  You're making people  Panic for no reason  It was a rumor  Get ready down  With the dump  You sound like  A horse's patoot  Hope they got that  Down the hall  That's the great Roland  Who's featured in  The 80's new wave  Promos that  That Tim make  So what would you  Little maniacs 
[01:39:30]  Like to do first  Let's say  There's no way  I'm doing  That goddamn voice  Science  She blinded me  What's science  Oh  And she filled me  My energy  Bueller  Bueller  Shoot that poison arrow  To my heart  Shoot that poison arrow  Shoot that poison arrow  To my heart  Shoot that poison arrow  Do you take drugs Danny? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah we can  Good  Who can it be now?  Who can it be now?  Who can it be now?  Who can it be now?  It's 80's new wave Tuesday  On the LB and Anthony show  You know every Tuesday  We usually play  One maybe two of those  But I discovered  That Jimmy really hates  Tim's voice in those promos  So now I can't help  But play all of them 
[01:40:30]  Gotta keep playing  I just love  When Jimmy goes  I want that minute  Of my life back  It's 80's new wave Tuesday  I'm gonna join  Tim's little pack of voices  I decided  That would be pretty good  Because you actually  Do that one pretty well  It's 80's  Well now I can't  So to go into production  And be part of it  It's 80's new wave Tuesday  And then we can go  Wait a minute  That was Opie doing that one  But I like the other voice  So why are they doing  80's new wave Tuesday  Maybe because they 
[01:41:00]  Didn't prepare  For their radio show  It's a nail through my hand  It is really bad  That's why we have to play  All of them today  The crucifixion nail  Through my hand  Alright  We gave you the Brady thing  We gave you the Britney thing  We gave you the writer's thing  Christina Aguilera  Finally confirming  She's pregnant  Finally  Who didn't know this  Did you see her belly  Yeah she's six months  Pregnant  Something like that  And she's finally admitting  Okay I'm not getting fat  I am pregnant  Yeah  Prego 
[01:41:30]  And then you got  Joe Torre looking weird  In his Dodgers  Manager's uniform  It was much too small for him  And then you got  Ah the Steelers beat the Ravens  Last night 38-7  Whatever  What else is going on  Older men  Older men look weird  In sports uniforms  They should never be forced  To wear the uniform  Of the team  No  You don't look  In football  They don't make them  Dress up with shoulder pads  It would be hysterical  Send him in  You look dumb Joe  You're a 70 year old man  Don't wear the uniform  You have to be an older gentleman  In a sweater  Even like a younger guy  Coaching a baseball team 
[01:42:00]  Just looks weird  Because you know  He's not going in there  Ever  I wonder how that all started  How the tradition started  Where baseball managers  Have to wear the uniform  Because like you said  At some point they played  You don't have like  Isaiah Thomas  In like you know  In the same uniform  As the rest of the Knicks  No  It would just look silly  They wear a suit  They wear a suit  Like gentlemen  And the guy on the sidelines  The football coach  Wears his thing  But then again  They're coaches  In baseball  It's a manager  He's managing things 
[01:42:30]  So let's find out  Why that started  Somebody decided  That's the thing to do  And it's now tradition  So they're not going to  You know  Let me think  Let me think about this  Yeah  In other sports  Do they ever go out  Onto the field  Or the court  Not  Nah  Not really  Alright  There you go  That's what I'm saying  In baseball  They walk out  To the mound  To the mound  They walk out  And talk to the  Various umps 
[01:43:00]  They're on the field  In other sports  When you go out  Onto the field  Or whatever  You're going to get  Technical for the most part  When you're running out there  Yeah you don't see like  You don't see like  A coach  Of a football team  Out there  Midfield  God man  You're pretty smart  You know  And then  Basketball  Do they go out  Onto the court  In basketball  No  And then hockey  No  They run up and down  The sidelines  Stays in the box  Yeah no hockey  He can't go out there  He's going to wear  Shoes  He's going to slip  So that's the only thing  I could 
[01:43:30]  Alright we're going to  Try to find out  The answer to that  Hey I want to  Give one of our  Buddies a plug  Sean Hannity  E-Rock  Wake up  You're the one  Who told me this  Son of a bitch  What  You're getting what  No I had some stuff  Written down  Sean Hannity  How did you know  I was going to say  Sean Hannity  I was looking at  Something else  Obviously you were  Thank you  Some other stuff  I had here  What were you looking at  Yeah what were you  Reading on  Just tell us  Right now what  I had Rob Barlin  Information  I have my  Alright I don't know 
[01:44:00]  Why  Alright  What else  Alright go ahead  So Sean Hannity  Is going to have  Dog the Bounty Hunter  On when  I believe on his  Radio show today  At 3 o'clock  Radio show  Why not the TV  I think it's going  He does both  He does the radio  And then the TV  Is this going to be  An apology fest  Or what  What do you think  What do you predict  Oh yeah  He's just going to be  A babbling ass  He's our friend though  Why would you say that  No no  Oh you scared me  And then he's going to be  And Larry King  Tomorrow  That's going to be  Terrific  That'll be good  For our show  The dog is here 
[01:44:30]  Dog the Bounty Hunter  I like your hairdo  Is that something new  Yes  Is that a mallet  The mallet  They call it  The mallet  He needs one over his head  So why do you hate  Eggnog  Larry  Give me a turn  Let's say hi to Rob  In Jersey  Rob what's up  Hey what's up  I know why  The managers  Of baseball teams  Wear uniforms  Alright 
[01:45:00]  Back in ye  Olden days  There used to be  A lot of player managers  So they had to be  In uniform  In case they were  Actually called  On to the field  To play  Didn't Pete Rose  Do that at one point  Yeah Rose was a player  You bet  He was a player manager  It was just a gamble  The team took  Alright  You know  Thank you for that  Answer Rob  I guess we didn't  Really need to know  But  I was curious  We like to inform people  Jimmy was very emotional  When Zoe crossed  The finish line  At the New York City Marathon  We talked about this earlier 
[01:45:30]  I was  Because she has a perm  Like John Candy  Every  And planes  Trains and automobiles  Every year  She has to be last  She has MS  And this is her  20th marathon  And she finished last  Again  Again  And the news  Is going to report  Like they don't know  This person  They know this person  She does this every year  The winning time  Of the New York City Marathon  Was not the two hours  Nine minutes  Of the first finisher  It was 28 hours  And 45 minutes  Why?  Because that is when  Zoe Koplowitz finished 
[01:46:00]  The last person  Across the line  But she should be  Taken first  Because Zoe has MS  And was walking  With crutches  The entire time  She's completed  This journey  20 straight years  She is a champion  By any measure  No she's not  She lost  And she's an attention seeker  Why don't you just  Please admit that  There are guys  With real stories  And women  With real stories  That ran that race  And you don't get  To see them  On the news  Year after year  After year  Because guess what  They're not looking  Behind them to see  Oh someone's slower  Than me  I better slow down  Someone that finishes 
[01:46:30]  The race  Every year  Last  That means  They have it  In their head  I gotta do some things  To make sure  I'm last every year  I'm sorry  She looks like  A fat Nathan Lane  And I don't like  Her face  Zoe's face  Gives me the willies  Yeah  Zoe  That's right  I'm picking on MS Zoe  What is she gonna do  About it  Nothing  I know it's not  Popular to say  This stuff  But it just  Bothers me  Everyone hates her  I know there were  Guys that ran the race  With two artificial legs  Where's their attention 
[01:47:00]  They didn't like  Make sure they're last  So then the news  Would cover them  You want more Tyra  Or what  I don't know  Now I'm mad like Anthony  Or what  Why are you yelling  I don't know  I just don't know  It's just everybody  Start yelling  About nothing  I think because  Zoe bothers us  We hate Zoe  We want Zoe to fall down  That's why  That's why  This show's different though  We take you inside  This stuff  Like think about Zoe 
[01:47:30]  Right  She is doing  She's doing the  New York City Marathon  Think about it  For a second  If she comes in  Second to last  No attention  So she's sitting there  Walking on the course  Looking behind her  To make sure  She's still last  And there's probably  People that are even slower  Now she's gotta slow down  And start itching her leg  And adjusting this and that  Just to get back  Into last place  And that  Must have felt like  A slaughterhouse  When she crossed  That finish line  Yeek  And people would say 
[01:48:00]  So what  And they're probably right  But uh  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  That was a bit nasty  But fun  Alright we'll play this  As we go to break  And we'll do some Tyra's  Before we get out of here  For today  The slaughterhouse  Smells so bad  It's probably the worst  Thing ever  Death  Blood  Rotting  Awful  Fear  Confusion 
[01:48:30]  Dumb animal heads  Turning left and right  What's happening  Why is my head  In this  Contraption  With a razor coming up  Uh oh  Big dopes  Animals are dopes  What do you think's  Happening  Idiot  Becoming a steak  Yeah we're petting you  With this knife  You moron  Stupid sheep  They just hang upside down  They dip me in something  It looks like hot water  Uh oh  How dumb are chickens 
[01:49:00]  Why don't they just  All attack the guy  Chickens suck  They can't  They don't  They just kind of  Let the guys  Pick them up by their feet  And stick them on their thing  They're like  I guess it's my turn  Just a ride  It's a fun ride  Called the rip you apart  And then boil you alive  Cause humans like chickens  Cause you're tasty  You're a fat body  They all watch their pals  Just go off  They do  And they follow suit  And they think it's gonna be  Different for them  Yeah the cow 
[01:49:30]  That's right behind the one  With his head in the thing  That the razor blade  Comes up and slits his throat  He just goes  Well maybe it's different  This time  Yeah maybe  They're cutting his throat  But they're just fitting me  For a tie  Stupid  His friend turns around  Hey Murray  My throat is cut  And then Murray's like  Well that's not why I'm here  I have a wedding to go to  Maybe they think 
[01:50:00]  They're getting turtlenecks  To hide that thing  Yeah they're gonna get  Turtlenecks  Or maybe  Perhaps  Perhaps a little  A little tuck on the neck  A little tuck  Jimmy you make a great point  You think all that  You think all that  Clucking would mean something  That they could  Cluck a  Communicate  Or a strategy to each other  Maybe they could start  Communicating with that  Clucking  And go  Hey this is not a good scene  Let's try to do something  But no they don't  Here comes the next one 
[01:50:30]  It's not gonna be me  Just the  I'm a cute one  No  It's just funny to watch chickens  When they grab them by the feet  And they roughly stick them  Into that thing  And then they haul them off  And every chicken  Sees it happening  And instead of rebelling  Or running for the door  They just kind of  Fall all over each other  Going  It's like do you wonder  Why we'd kill you  Even if you weren't delicious  We'd kill you  Those are idiots  Listen to that sound  Yeah  And the chickens are upside down 
[01:51:00]  Going in a circle  And they're getting  They're getting like  Dipped in hot  Awful water  And have their feathers removed  And they come around  And the other chickens  See them featherless  With no heads  And they're like  Wow this is great  They must be getting  New better feathers 
[01:51:30]  Better feathers  They probably took them off  To give them  Better warmer feathers  Stupid asses  They're all getting  They're all getting  They're all getting  Snuggly winter coats  They're just waiting  For them to be fitted  Do you think  Do you think veal  You think animals  That become veal  Just kind of feel lazy  Like they see  All their friends playing  And they're like  We can't move at all  They just gotta kind of  Sit here like dummies  And they don't  They don't care  No  That's all they do  That's why I don't  That's why I eat veal  Constantly  Yeah  Load up on it  Those animals are lazy 
[01:52:00]  Hey uh  Wow Jimmy  That is hilarious  Caroline Friday  7 o'clock show  Yes  I'm being fitted  For a tie  My tuxedo's  A bit tight  What do you think  He thinks  The second  He realizes  He's not being fitted  For a tie  God no  As soon as  As soon as like  He gets  Gets there  And he realizes  That the man  Isn't pulling off  His bloody gloves  And putting fabric  Around his neck 
[01:52:30]  He's expecting  A fabric  To be looped  Around his head  But instead  It's that metal  Clamp  And then he sees  The razor  He's like  Ah nerds  They got me  And the next cow  Looks at him  And just goes  Okay where's my hat  Where's my hat  They're just  Tucking this neck a bit  I'm having a little  Lipo down on the neck  So I look younger  For the photo  Those  Those murderous gloves  The murderous rubber gloves  Of the slaughterhouse employee  Yeah  Play that  Play that for everybody 
[01:53:00]  Here we go  You're  What's  What's  At  A  What's  That  Is  What do you  Have  gan  Me د  We'll be right back. 
[01:53:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:54:00]  Sorry, I got caught in a tuna net.  Back to Zoe.  We play this song as we go to break for that thing.  Big dumb Zoe. 
[01:54:30]  There should be a bunch of Zoes walking into a slaughterhouse.  They think they're getting a medal.  Oh, look, they must be fitting me for a medal.  So they just take her crutches and put her head inside of a contraption.  And she's like, oh, no, this is not a reward.  This is a punishment for tying up traffic again.  Yeah.  But first, it's Cheryl in Boston.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm not on the radio.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, you are, Cheryl.  What's up?  That's how it works.  Come on.  I just called BCN in Boston because the gentleman just walked into our office and he's got everybody 
[01:55:00]  up in arms saying that he just heard on the radio that Brady was suspended for four games.  Yes.  Yeah.  Based on.  What?  Go ahead.  Sorry.  A blood test.  Yeah, something within it.  We don't understand.  We're reporting this like everyone else and we're just waiting for more info.  So his A sample came back positive last week.  And per the drug policy, Brady exercised the right to have his B sample tested on Monday.  I don't even know what that means, but what do they give you two tests? 
[01:55:30]  A leak source told ESPN that Brady's likely to appeal his four-game suspension.  That's all we know.  We're waiting like everyone else.  Four-game suspension, some kind of substance thing.  All right.  For Zoe.  Cheryl took us off track there.  For Zoe.  One after the other, that fat, curly-headed head, just right in a nice strap of metal.  Where they hang her upside down like they do the sheep.  Yeah, they hang sheep upside down and they strip them naked and then they cut their throats 
[01:56:00]  like lamb.  And they're all just hang back.  Their throats bleeding.  How embarrassing.  Not only is your throat cut, but you got to look at your friend.  You're like, what happened?  I don't know.  You told me to come here.  Well, speaking of which, I'm pal-talked.  They got it.  Before the chicken walks into the room, today I become a made man.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Bleeding into their own mouths and faces.  Stupid ass.  I thought I was going to be a made man. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Look what they're doing to me.  You know what?  I hear they're cutting throats in there.  But maybe they're going to throw you a birthday party.  Oh, no.  They're going to kill me.  Yeah, that's what they all think.  A party for me?  They think it's all their friends coming to honor them like at a roast.  All right.  We're rolling.  We're rolling to a break here.  What's the sound for tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30?  I believe it was this. 
[01:57:00]  Hold on.  And by the way, if a day goes by and you don't know the sound that you have to listen for,  all you have to do is go to onaradio.com.  We have the sound right there on the front page.  All right.  Here's tomorrow's sound.  How'd your parents die?  When you hear that, between 7 and 7.30, the 10th caller will win.  $1,000, courtesy of Opie and Anthony.  Stephen Lynch, before the break.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics. 
[01:57:30]  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy!  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  You're trying to take pity.  And I know full well 
[01:58:00]  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics  Take it quirky!  At the Special Olympics  Oh, you're so sing pretty 
[01:58:30]  You can sing at my wedding when I get married  Someone's got a mouthful  Water  Hi, welcome back  It ain't me and I am  Hope you and Anthony show  You're yelling again  Oh  There we go  Nothing 
[01:59:00]  I was yelling  There's no need for it  Let's keep this  Hold a civil tongue  Right  We don't know anything else on the Brady situation  We know as much as everybody else  I guess we'll find out more during the press conference at 9.30  I know BCN's covering it  Yeah  Apparently a four-game suspension 
[01:59:30]  Really all we know  It's Opie and Anthony  Carpoolers  Huh?  Just reading something about this guy from Carpoolers  What's that?  I didn't really read it  I'm just looking at the picture  Oh, screw Carpoolers  And it's just  You know, I'm kind of bummed  The Rider Strike is going to, you know  It's going to take Caveman off  Was that still on?  I think so  Was it?  I hear they've been losing viewers  I actually have not watched this 
[02:00:00]  Losing? They never got them  Well, they started  I think people watched to see if it would be a train wreck  When they first  Yeah  You know  Last night  Last night there was like nothing on television  At all  Like as far as the movies go  I went through  Like every single  HBO  The movie's on demand  Just going through it  And it's just crap, crap  Garbage, nothing  And during that whole time  In the little square  You know how you can  You get the little picture in picture  For the guide  And you're going through the guide  Looking for something  But there's something else on 
[02:00:30]  In the corner  It was  I don't know  Channel 4  Channel 7  I don't even know  It might have been Channel 2  With a sitcom on  Your standard  2007  A sitcom  It was so bad  I was getting so frustrated  That I couldn't find something to watch  Not because I couldn't find something to watch  But because I couldn't turn off  This god awful crap  I wanted to hit anything  Just to get it off  The most unfunny  Fake garbage 
[02:01:00]  Like  Like  I was watching  Thinking  Nope  Nobody  Talks like this  That's what they want  That's what people want  Nobody talks like this  In real life  It's not a real  Life situation  What show?  I don't even know what it was  But it was  A couple was at a house  And they were investigating  Not as investigators  Just as a couple  What had happened  With two of their friends  And the guy's acting like  Now don't touch any evidence  Don't  Ha ha ha  Can laughs 
[02:01:30]  Like he goes into  Playing a police type character  Thing  But he's not a cop  And his wife doesn't say  What are you doing  Yeah yeah  And he's like  If we look over here  We can see that  And I'm watching  People don't do this  That's what people want  They want a big set  A big overly dressed set  Canned laughter  And just cute  Artificial life  Yeah  Hey  We gotta get some of this  Tyra audio  Before we  You know  End this side of the show  Tyra was talking about 
[02:02:00]  The vagina  We could say that  And  This is where she brings up  A girl on stage  To  To  To what  Well I guess the audio  Yeah the audio  Explain it  Alright  Okay who  Has never  Been brave enough  In this room here  To sneak a peek  And check out  What's going on  You  One of our ladies  In our round here  Stand on up  Come over here  What's your name  Stand here  Give her a hand 
[02:02:30]  If she's just brave enough  To do this  Brave  Lana  Lana  So why have you never  Looked  Just another body part  Oh  Well I'm  Part of it  I'm scared  And then  I pay the doctor  To do that  Like that  That's why I did  That's why I never  Did it  You paid the jockey to do that  Okay  Okay  That's cute  You paid the jockey  Alright  And I understand  For the audience  They handed out prizes  Everyone got a pair 
[02:03:00]  Of mirrored shoes  So they'd never  Have to  They've never  Looked at their own  Vagina again  Idiots  We don't have  One of these things  But is it  Is it normal  For women  Not to look at it ever  I gather  I've heard that before  Really  Like some women  Are completely  You know  Embarrassed  I guess by  I don't know why  I think guys  Kind of dig them  I think you have to  Worry about it  But yeah  Yeah some girls  Are very embarrassed  Well Tyra takes it  A little further  With this  Embarrassed girl 
[02:03:30]  Alright so  I see that Dr. Debbie  Has brought a little prop  Here to help us  Better understand  Our anatomy  Down there  And  Especially if you're  Checking yourselves  For the first time  We need to know  What we're seeing  So why don't you  Walk us through this  Sure  Walk us through  Well  Lana  Pay attention  Okay  And this is what  I brought with me  This is the  Wondrous vulva puppet  Which is  You know  It's a little  A what  I don't know  A what  Can we see what  This thing  Looks like 
[02:04:00]  I mean puppets  You know  I hope it  Has  I'll tell you  What it looks like  The thing that  Robert Redford  Has on his head  On Good Morning America  He has gray sideburns  And a red JFK wig  I want to take off  His wig in Dealey Plaza  That is an awful  What are you doing  This  You're 70 years old  That's the hair  Of a 30 year old man  This is what we talk  About Jimmy  Like it's okay  To dye your hair  But then it gets  To an age  Where you have to  Give up on it  Because it just  Looks downright creepy 
[02:04:30]  That couldn't be  His hair  Hair  It couldn't be  His hair  No  Maybe it is  His hair  Absolutely not  And he's still  Dying it  The red  Wow that's what  I'm going to look like  That's a wig  No that is  Yeah  That's got to be  Look at it  You can't even tell  If it's on right  Or sideways  It's  It's a Lego person  The front of it  Is hitting his glasses  He wouldn't have  A forehead  That's hair growing  Out of his forehead  Well  I guess  It's atrocious  He didn't want to  Lose his trademark  Red hair I guess 
[02:05:00]  Now look at that  That looks a little different  Well because that's makeup  Yeah makeup  Makeup  They do good in the movies  When they do that  Yeah  Makeup and lighting  And all that  Stupid gray sideburns  Stop trying to be  A distinguished gentleman  Just go bald like Sean Connery  And wave at everyone  Hi I'm a doddering idiot  I was the natural  Now I need diapers  I like Redford by the way  I could hear that  Good actor  Hey the video is called  Tyra Banks helps women 
[02:05:30]  Learn what's up  Down there  And  And there's the puppet  It's giant  The puppet is giant  The puppet's huge  And  I don't know  What it's supposed to do  Like  I understand  When you're dealing  With children  You bring out puppets  So that you can  Teach them things  What the hell  Are they thinking  With this thing  My observation  Is simple  The top of the puppet  On the head of the puppet  It looks like  It's a ribbon  Yeah 
[02:06:00]  There's like a ribbon  Is that supposed to be  A ribbon or something else  I have no idea  The puppet makes no sense  Alright back to the audio  All the puppet  Which is  You know  It's a little silly  Because of course  We don't really have  Velvet and satin  And little flowers  Down there  So when you do  Look down there  You know  Don't be surprised  If you don't find this  I'm so happy  That you have this  Because it really  It makes it cute  And sweet  And not scary  Right  It's like a stuffed animal  That is scary  Who's scared  The puppet looks like 
[02:06:30]  A Hershey's Kiss  That has been attacked  By a machete wielding maniac  That's what the puppet  Looks like  That's a perfect  That glanced  A single blow  With the machete  It looks like  The cow's back  In Apocalypse Now  In the last season  Oh god  That's what it looks like  They teach young men  To drop fire on people  And they're hacking up  A cow on the outside  If you've seen  The end of Apocalypse Now  I realize  It's a 30 year old reference  No that's fantastic

[02:31:00]  Completely ridiculous  So  And then the one guy  Got a hit  Yeah  And the catcher  Now has to tag along  With them as they  Look like a fiddler crab  Going to a first base  A fiddler crab  Why do you not play baseball  First of all  What if the guy  At the plate  Fucking has to steal home  The catcher knows  What he's doing  I know  You tag yourself out  Who wins  Plus you can know  What signals you're calling  Because it's part of your body  That's calling them  What a fucking scam  They have going on  They'll probably make  Millions in baseball  Fucking cheaters

[02:33:00]  The one guy  Did get a base hand  But then the normal brother  Threw it to first base  And the catcher was  Covering first base  Of course he was  He was being led to it  Because he's running  With his brother  There's no way  He can't get out  They go to the beach  And instead of building  A sand castle  They just go under the sand  And nip at people's feet  When they walk by  Can you remove your children  They're nipping at  My children's toes  Will you tell them  To stop nipping  At everybody's tootsies

[02:35:00]  He was known  For doing this  Who was the other guy  Also that had to  Take the mitt off  And stick it under his arm  That was Jim Abbott  Jim Abbott was amazing though  Because he threw a no hitter  And he would pitch  He would throw the ball  I think he was left  He would throw the ball  And in his delivery  With the glove  Tucked under his arm  He would release the ball  And then scoop his arm up  Grab his mitt  And he could field  And take the ball out  And throw it  But Jim Abbott was like  A legitimate pitcher  That was ridiculous  To watch him catch the ball  Flipping into his hand 
[02:35:30]  Like get rid of the glove  He still got the ball  And he could throw the ball  And he could pitch  Oh fuck you do that  He was a real pitcher  Every time you struck out  Against him  On the way back to the dugout  You had to say  A guy with one arm  Just got me out  And I'm fucking disgusted  I would have just  Hit line drives at him  Let's see how fast you are now  Let's see how fucking fast you are  He's on the mound  And you just  Pound in line drives at him  You're no patty cakes  Motherfucker  Let's see how fast you are now  Couldn't do a push up  At gunpoint  Huh  Clap hands  Till daddy gets home

[03:04:00]  A lot of married men going to jail  And his girlfriend will start putting two and two together  That's why your dick always smelled  You had dirt on your shoes  I knew it  How come everybody at the morgue calls you Quincy?

[03:11:00]  It probably happened  While she was on the phone  She was talking to one of her friends  Like just tickling her ass  And she was like  My whole hand is in my ass  And it doesn't hurt  I'm my own Caligula movie  It's me  By myself  Name of the set  And the people of Rome  The old fistful of large  Fist of fury  Oh my god  That's the most disgusting thing  I've ever seen  That is still me  Isn't it  I'm a pretty freaky dude  I could never  Well we won't show you  A shit hat then  Oh  What's a shit hat  Tub girl  Shit hat 
[03:11:30]  Where do y'all find these things  Ah the internet  You know that thing  That was invented  So college professors  Can exchange ideas  Over great distances  Doctors can work together  Yeah doctors can work together  Across the world  To solve diseases  To cure diseases  From like  Very convenient  You're in New York  One guy's in LA  I'm in New Delhi  A doctor can send pictures  Of a patient  And uh  Or you could send  A girl shitting into a cup  And another one eating it  Oh  Well  Whatever works for you  There you go  Oh my goodness gracious  That is

[03:12:30]  Imagine that  In front of 10,000 people  Oh man  Tapping in  A liberal guilt  Oh that would have  Been good  People would have  Lost their minds  In searches  Bruce what's up  Hey guys  I just want to tell you  DL is hilarious  Last time he was  On your show  I was watching  Fox News  In the middle of the night  And he was on  The Red Eye show  And he was great  I was just wondering  What Fox thought  Of the way  DL was talking  I can't believe  They let him get away  With what he was saying  Oh I can 
[03:13:00]  Yeah baby  I don't know  I didn't watch it  I figure Bill O'Reilly  Can say what he says  I can say whatever  Say whatever you want  They're pretty good  Because it's 2 o'clock  In the morning  They air that show  So like they're pretty  They're pretty okay  With content  They're not babies  On Fox about  Yeah but you know  It's funny to me  When the content  Like this  Like people are just  Every time we  I come on here  It's always  Like Dog the Bounty Hunter  Oh yeah  Horrible  Yeah but he's the first dog  That ever killed itself  Ain't it  But can you imagine  How good the sex was  With that sister  That the son 
[03:13:30]  Turned her hand  You gotta turn your father  Oh man yeah right  Dad you have to understand  Sharnisa can make  Her ass clap  You gotta have to  Turn her hand  That's an angle  We didn't think about  That's very funny  Oh man  Yeah the son  Turning his dad  Turn your own father in  15 grand I heard he got  I heard he got 15 grand  15 thousand  But wasn't he on the show  With him  Yeah  So he fucked himself up  For 15 grand  Yeah  He obviously just hated  His father's guts  That was just a way  To stick it to dogs  But when a dude  Wear a mullet  Don't you expect him  To say nigga  Of course 
[03:14:00]  Like if you got a gun  A badge and a mullet  Nigga is the first thing  You say right  That's pretty much  Well he has no gun  That's pretty much it  He has no gun  Well he has mace  Yeah people are surprised  He's a felon  That he's chasing  And he chasing other felons  Without a gun  He has no gun  I didn't know  He didn't have a gun  No one was surprised though  I mean when I heard the tape  I'm like yeah so  I'm glad they don't  You know what the thing about  Yeah when a white dude  Say nigga  And they make the news  We are right  We're in the wrong society  This guy had it written  All over him  I don't know  Not like you know  Some politician  Where it's like  Oh wow  That slipped out  Did you hear what 
[03:14:30]  Lieberman said  Jesus Christ  Yeah yeah exactly  Nothing like that  But  Every day I'm sure  The dog was just  Blurting that out  And he said  I don't want her to think  The whole tape was  I said  And I don't want her  To ruin my whole career  And how it's like  It'll never happen  Never happen  As it's happening  He's saying that  And he's quoting like  Martin Luther King  Saying it's the content  Of her character  He has to use the content  Of her character  But the thing I don't get  Is like  All of us say stuff  That we hope nobody  Hears us say  Yeah  That if we're made public 
[03:15:00]  We would look like  The worst people in history  Yep  Like if my son  Came home with a white woman  My wife would have  Something to say about it  She wouldn't just  She wouldn't just  Would be congratulations  I'd say congratulations  You know what's interesting  About that  She would man  She'd say something  Like I want to be there  When my son knocks off  His first white woman  That's a joy for me  But see  You know what's interesting  And you bring up a good point  It does work both ways  Yeah  Like black  Like parents  Aren't  Some  You can't talk for everybody 
[03:15:30]  They're not happy  When their son or daughter  Brings home someone white  If I dated  My mother used to say  I'm not lying  If she can't use our comb  Don't bring her home  No way  I am not  I shit you not  No way  And I'm not like  I'm not advocating anybody  But I think that  You know  Here's the deal  We all say bullshit  Let's at least  Stop being shocked  Right  When somebody says  Some shit that you  Feign surprise at  Yeah  Like the fact that  A dude that runs  People down  Chases felons 
[03:16:00]  Of course he uses that word  Of course he does  Man word  I just don't get it  It's frightening  That your private conversations  Even though the guy's  Obviously a horse's ass  But it's frightening  That your private conversations  Can sink you  I guess  But it hasn't always been that way  Maybe it has been  No  I mean if they caught you  On tape saying something  Or if you were caught  Yeah  But that's because  We're such a voyeuristic society now  That everybody  Like it's shit  That I shouldn't know about you  Like  Can I hate people  From the privacy of my own home  Apparently not  You gotta  You gotta watch  That people aren't taping you  But the idea that 
[03:16:30]  Now all of a sudden  There is one way  That we're supposed to act  And that  You know  And I'm not  And honestly  I'm not advocating  Everybody go out  And say whatever they  You know  But I think that  There's so much anger now  Because people feel like  They can't even have  An honest to goodness  Reactions  Yeah  Like I  You know  I think censorship is bad  But I think self-censorship  Is the fucking worst  Like I better not say this  Because  But I think that  That's why we so like  So fucking fragmented  As a society  Because everybody goes  Well if I say  This they'll think this 
[03:17:00]  Yeah  The more we try to  Protect everybody  Against what we're saying  The more fragmented  The whole country becomes  So I just  Like  It's some shit that happens  Like  Two months ago  There were  Eleven coal miners  That were trapped  In a coal mine  In what  Virginia  No it was Utah  Utah  Right right right  And they couldn't get them out  And two weeks ago  3500 gold miners  Were trapped in a gold mine  In Johannesburg  South Africa  Every one of them  Black people got out  Because black people  Ain't waiting for help  This is Africa  They will never come 
[03:17:30]  Dig  And I see Ellen  On TV crying about a dog  And it just  And not even a dog  That ain't  That's dead  It's a dog that ain't  Living with her hairdresser  Anymore  Right right  The only time black people  Cry over a dog  Is when it comes in last  I just bet on this  Motherfucker  And you could kill  A person for you  Like you know  You could kill a person  For you  Like OJ's at home  Going damn  I'm glad I didn't  Kill a dog  But when you go  Around the world  Dogs are not 
[03:18:00]  As revered  As you go  To the third world  You go to China  They ain't walking  No fucking dog  Because you don't  Walk food  Yeah  You would never  See a black dude  Walking a chicken  Like come on  Two piece  You and Biscuit  Get in the car  That shit just  Ain't  So I just  I think that we  Have a warped  Kind of  Perception of  What's important  We're pretty  Self important  Over here  Is what it is  We have a world  Series with just  Us in it  Yeah  Yeah  World  Well  Canada  Sometimes  Fuck Ecuador  We'll do it  On our own  We don't need 
[03:18:30]  I always found  That funny  Growing up  Yeah  How pompous  Are we  The world  Championship  I want to see  What Poland has  I want to see  What team they  Could get on the  Field  Before I  Decide that  We're the world  Series  In Poland  The guy's  Pitching a football  They can't  Figure out that  Baseball over there  Though  Russia and  Poland  And a few  Of those  Of course they can  It's fucking cold  Ten months out of the year  Yeah they just can't  Figure it out though  Two weeks of practice  Then it's winter again  And you know  You're taking that  Pompous thing a little  Further with sports 
[03:19:00]  And then you got  Hockey  The NHL  Hockey is obviously  All about Canada  So what do we do  We take all their  Great players  Bring them to America  Make it seem like  We are this great  Nation of hockey players  We got like five  In the NHL  And now Gretzky  We made him American  Yeah exactly  Whatever we  We were  We were just like  You remember  I was reading a story  That the  I think one of the  CEOs  Of one of the companies  I think it was  The Chinese toy company  That was  That was  I don't know if it was 
[03:19:30]  I don't want to get it wrong  Because you know  Your listeners  Getting on the internet  Check shit out  You defended the  But  He  Was involved  In the tainted  The mercury tainted  Toys  Oh the lead  Yeah  And he killed himself  You know in China  You never know  And he was the CEO  Who was disgraced  And he killed himself  Like when we  When our CEOs  Kill their  Or are disgraced  And do something  Fucked up  They get a buyout package  And  Yeah they leave  Yeah they get to leave 
[03:20:00]  With like this  Golden parachute  Yeah  An appointment to the  Bush administration  And this guy was  Dishonored  And killed himself  What happened to the guy  From Tyco  He was in big trouble  Dennis something  He went to jail  Didn't he  Oh was he in jail  Oh yeah  He was in fucking  Hot water  He's in jail  Like in this  Hot water  A little more trouble  Than that  Dick up your ass  Isn't quite hot water  That's what he used  To wash away the shame  Hey DL  What's your take  On the Oprah thing 
[03:20:30]  You following this story  The Oprah school thing  Yeah  And what were they doing  They were prosecuting  Yeah they were  Kind of selling  The girls in the school  For  I think they finally have  Some cash  Yeah  A nice  Life path  Yeah this is like  You know  Oprah  Pulled all this money  To build this school  All kinds of security  Around it  And stuff  And yeah  She's running  She's running  The fucking  Bunny ranch  Of Africa  I came in to learn  Well now you're gonna  Learn about dick girl  That's what you're gonna  Learn about  Yeah  That's your lesson  Oprah didn't pay attention 
[03:21:00]  Though she didn't even  Care about the velvet  Curtains and the red lights  Why are there beds  Instead of desks  Long story  It's cultural  Reading, writing  And rim jobs  That's so horrible  That um  No so  Then she gave him her  She gave him her  She gave him cell phones  Right  Yeah that's what she said  So now you can  You can fuck one of the kids  And have Oprah listen  That's horrible  That's horrible  Oprah  Listen to this  Oh that's horrible 
[03:21:30]  Oh that's horrible  So she was like  Freaked out  Cause she put all the  Security up  Because  It's not  That there's a lot of  Rape that goes on  Over there  In South Africa  With these young girls  So she built this  Big  Walls around the place  Like a compound  And locked them in  Locked them in  And then hires  You know  Fucking  But that's just us  Like we always think  Like in America  We think that  If we throw money  At something  Or we make it  Better than ever  That the people 
[03:22:00]  That the things  Will be better  Like I was just reading  I was watching 60 Minutes  And they had this thing  Called Plumpy Nut  They made this  Peanut butter  Not the  Like you guys  But they made  This peanut butter  Out of  That peanut butter  Sorry  It's already  Discussing to me  But they made  This peanut butter  And they put  This multi  Doctors Without Borders  Did it  And they put  This powdered milk  And multivitamin  And it's saving  Starving kids  All over the world  I mean  It's stopping  Starving  They believe  They can stop  Starvation  It's easy to store  Peanuts are plentiful  So it can really  Stop kids from  Dying of starvation 
[03:22:30]  And the first question  A western media  Person asked  Well aren't they  Allergic to peanuts  No bitch  They're allergic to hunger  You're only allergic to food  When you got some  Like you've never seen  Black people  With like food  Like we don't like  With eating disorders  Yeah yeah  Anorexia  Like Nicole Richie  She got half of her  Yeah that's just half  You know the black  Half of her  Want a sandwich  Like a mother  God damn  Yeah that  Freaking anorexia man  It's just  Skinny white chicks 
[03:23:00]  We uh  Carlin had the  Greatest line about that  He's like  What an American disease  Rich cunts don't  Want to eat  Fuck them  Right right right  I've invented a lot  Of stuff since  We were growing up  Yeah  We didn't have  Peanut allergies  When we were growing up  No no no  My publicist has that  She can't  If you open a bag  Of peanuts  She has to clear  The whole thing  She can't  So let's uh  Check it out  I'm sorry about  My language  I apologize  Oh Jimmy  No they are man  We got shit 
[03:23:30]  That like  Now bipolar  Like you could never  Tell my mother  I'm bipolar  I got two personalities  Well both you  Motherfuckers go  Clean that room  Better not take  The longest  There's two of you  Jimmy's line on OCD  What was it  Like now  Everyone has OCD  But back in the day  It was  I was called  Could you not do that  You look like an asshole  And that's all it was  It wasn't a disease  It wasn't a medication  For that  You were just told  To stop  Cut the shit  You washed your hands  30 times already  He molested you  It's over  You're 28 
[03:24:00]  Move on  Get over  And everything  That was their whole answer  Like I remember  Like parents are so  Protective of their kids  Like don't touch that stove  Like my mother  Used to go touch it  Now you know  Not to do that  That way you learned  Yeah  So I just  You gotta smoke a joint  With your kid  Right deal  You know what  I would rather  Him do it with me  And that's really  All I have right there  I don't really have  The parable  You should learn from  You're a different dad  I mean you're like  A comedian

[03:25:30]  The street at this point  What an asshole  I watched that  I watched that  Like a thousand times  When that happened  And all I was doing is  Why is this motherfucker  Even getting out of the truck  That's what I thought  Hit the gas  You dope  They renamed that  That intersection  It's called  Lock the door  In  The fucking  Reginald  Open the door  Can I help you  Yeah  Could you just  Head first  He peeks his head  Out the door  Could you just  Clobber me with something  There's a little  Toilet on me  Well you black people  Are sure angry  What the fuck  Well then maybe 
[03:26:00]  I could help  I remember when  They were  When they were  Riding  And everybody  Was putting  Black owned  On their business  Yeah yeah  Even Korean people  This a black owned  No  You don't spell  Blacker  What is that  There's no R in black  Brack owned  This is  Brack owned  I promise  It said that  So were you there  When it happened  I was actually there  But I wasn't  Like  I was in  Marina Del Rey  Buying a suit  And the dude  That was selling me  The suit  Said you're not 
[03:26:30]  Angry are you  And I'm like  What are you  Talking about  And they found  They found those  People  The cops  Not guilty  And I said  I better get home  He said you better  I'm closing up  Right now  It was the funnest  Time I've ever had  In my life  And I mean that  Sincerely  Really  Why Red  I felt so safe  At that time  Right there  I was living in  South Central  At the time  I didn't have to  Worry about the police  And I didn't have to  Worry about gang members  It was  It was  It was the safest  Time I ever felt  Everyone was together  Why no gang members 
[03:27:00]  Because there was  A unity  And just being  Pissed off at the cops  Yes  It was  It was just busy  All at one time  And it was amazing  For about  I was  That was when I had  Just became  An American gladiator  I had just joined  The national tour  So I wasn't even  A TV gladiator then  I got to come home  For three days  And the riots broke out  While I was home  So I got to  You should have  Put your uniform on  And run out in the streets  And get raped  What did you say  And demand an order  Civil order  I'm a gladiator  I'm a gladiator  He was a motherfucker  With his pipe 
[03:27:30]  He got some fucking  Two by four over the head  Running around in his singlet  And it was so funny  Because it was black  And Mexicans  Just looting  I didn't call it looting  I called it damn  I always wanted this TV  But you could get shit  That you couldn't get before  Like it was like  It was like  Flushed with  Hey man  Brand new shit  You can have  Why do you guys  That's bad  But why  What is it with you people  That makes the  No I didn't mean it like that 
[03:28:00]  But like  Why burn down your own neighborhood  Is what I meant to say  You know what  I don't get that  When I was  Honestly  When I was a kid  And you got to consider  That was what  15  12 years ago  It was 1992  So  Dude  But now I'm ever  Carrying the fucking one  15 years ago  But it was 15 years ago  15 years younger  You're angry  You don't understand  You really don't get  And I think a lot of people  When I was growing up  I didn't get  That that was  That I was hurting myself  So I think that  In retrospect  You go wow  I'm hurting myself 
[03:28:30]  But then  You would just anger  And just like  They always say  That you always hurt  The one you're closest to  And I think it's the same  Kind of dynamic  So  But now that I'm older  Even though I probably  Would just  Get just as angry  I think that  Like when black people  Get angry  We burn  You know  Shit happens  You know  But when white people  Get angry  They  They get on the  Internet  And make laws  The stuff that they  Burned up  Was in the neighborhood  But it wasn't theirs  So they felt like  They were just  You know  There's a lot of stuff  Building up back there  Remember Latasha Harley 
[03:29:00]  Latasha Harley  Grocery store owner  The cops had killed  A guy at the park  After he threw the gun  In the water  Then they shot him  So it was a lot of  Stuff going on  And it was in the neighborhood  But it wasn't their stuff  They didn't look at it  As their stuff  So that's what  Yeah but it still  At the end of the day  You didn't have nowhere to live  Like it was just  It was  It was  It was so  Like and now I live  The places we live  Like I was just in  New Orleans  I was doing the gig  In New Orleans  And it was the saddest thing  Because a lot of those  You go to those places 
[03:29:30]  And it's ten people  It's one person  For every few blocks  Living in a trailer  In front of their house  But when the fire started  By my house  You know in California  FEMA trucks were there  And I was like  Man  But I'm glad y'all here  So  I was really like  Fucked up  Because I was like  Man  If I had just stayed  In that same kind of situation  That it would have  I would have been  You know  Like so I can always understand  It was  We did a whole thing  I was weird  Oh how the Qualcomm stadium  Was it  Well  Is that the one 
[03:30:00]  Yeah it was like  Fucking circus music  Oh man  Kids and clowns  Yeah they had like  They were giving massages  To people  Yeah people went on purpose  Pancake breakfast  Yeah  Heading out caviar  Fans were playing  Here's some marshmallow  To stick  Go by the fire  Shit I set my dinner  On fire  So I can get a free dinner  Yeah  But it was  A whole different experience  And it makes you  That kind of stuff  Is to me  What makes people so angry  Because there's such  A disparity  You know  Disparity  Between just having  You know 
[03:30:30]  Being fortunate enough  To have your circumstances  Be different  And being poor  I think it's  Yeah it's  I honestly do think  It's rich and poor  More so than it is  Race  Actually I believe you're right  Because if you rich  And you  Like black people  Rich and poor  Is the same thing  There's a certain amount  Of bullshit you gotta take  Even when you're rich and black  But if you're a broke white dude  That is so fucked up  That is really  That's worse to be  I remember being  One of those  It sucks 
[03:31:00]  Like you're just a nigga  Without a tan  It is  It is so horrible  To go  I look like the people  That run these companies  But I can't get a job  Oh  Oh that's  I'm telling you  I  It is really rich and poor  But in this country  We don't like  We just don't like  We think  If you poor  And you did it  We go  You know  If you poor  Like this whole border thing  It isn't  That people  Worry about security  We worry about  The Canadian border 
[03:31:30]  Instead we don't want  A bunch of poor  Brown people  Flooding our borders  Yeah  That's it  We got enough  Black people  You ever been up  To Canada  It's very easy  To get into this country  Absolutely  They don't have  Those fences  And guards  They have a few bridges  That they watch  And that's about it  That's it  I've taken some  Back roads into Canada  And back  And there's just  One guy  At a little tower  I was in Buffalo  Go to Fort Erie  To hang the fuck  Out of strip joints  And you could just  Drive across  You don't see  Like gangs  Like the Canadian Kings 
[03:32:00]  Though  Coming into your  No I'm not  That's pretty much  Why I think  I understand what  He's saying though  If we're worried  About like tourists  And all that  They're not being honest  Right  The honesty there  Is they don't want  A bunch of Mexicans  Coming into the country  Wait no  Pick up fruit and leave  Right right  I'll tell you  Hold on  They want Mexicans  To come in  They just  They have a number  In their heads though  They do  They do  I'm not  I'm not kidding  Absolutely  The old gag  Who else is going to  Do that type of work  But that is truly  The mentality of this country 
[03:32:30]  I ain't doing that shit  Well they will  And my thing is this  Then it gets up to a number  Like alright stop  We gotta slow this down  But everybody  Has been the exploited  Like first  It was black people  Then it was Irish  Then it was you know  Italians  Then it was Chinese  I mean we've exploited  Kind of every  The Indians  They just wouldn't work  They're like fuck this  It's my land  I ain't doing none of this shit  Right  Alright  We'll have to kill you all  I'm sorry  I'm the fuck out of here  Here's an anthrax blanket  Silly goose  If you won't be exploited  You gotta die  Sorry  One Hachu 
[03:33:00]  Took them all out  Who'd have thought  That carefully disguised blanket  The Mexicans  The one problem  People have with immigration  With Mexicans  Like the resentment  That most people get  Is when you feel  People like  Won't assimilate  Into the culture  That's the only annoying  Yeah Canadians  Are pretty much  Americans  They come in  You have a little Italy  You have a Chinatown  You have a little Poli  You know  And nobody has to assimilate  Like people that are brown  But when you be able  When you call on the phone  It doesn't say  If you're Italian 
[03:33:30]  Press one  Now I understand  That's a business decision  That that's not  Right  Okay  But you don't have like  Tele-Italian  Or Italian  I think that's what it is  I'm not saying it's bad  That a Spanish radio station  But I think when you see  The culture changing  And the language changing  And people refusing  To at least speak English  Or try to speak English  That's where resentment comes  It has nothing to do  With anything else  But honestly  I think that that's a well  Kind of rounded view of it  But when you go to  A lot of places in the south  And the you know  The deep midwest 
[03:34:00]  And shit like that  They just hate brown people  They fucking just hate them  I'm not even trying to be funny  It's not a well intended argument  It's I don't want  These motherfuckers here  And that's  So I can get  But I would actually  Respect the argument  I wouldn't agree with it  But I would respect the argument  More if they just said  We don't want a bunch of  Poor brown people  Coming and becoming  A political power  And then changing the way  We do shit  We don't want that to happen  We don't want  Mount Rushmore  To have Paco and Lionel 
[03:34:30]  Say that  But like  They tell you shit  That is so ironic to me  Like they'll say  You know  In this country  Anybody can grow up  And be president  But out of the 40's  Some that have been president  They all have been  Riz White too  So I don't  There was a Catholic though  There you go  Rebel  Kind of eked in there  You know Mayor Bloomberg  Is thinking about  Entering the race in March  He's too mousy  But he's saying  That he would throw  And he's Jewish  But he said he would throw  A billion dollars  At his campaign 
[03:35:00]  Yeah that'd get it done  That's a waste of a billion bucks  That'd get it done  He said he would throw  A billion dollars  At his campaign  If he ran for president  I kind of liked  So he would buy  He would buy the election  But doesn't everybody  He's not as  He's not as much  Of a  He's not as much  Of a  He did too  Party lines  I think the rest of them are  Because he has his own money  Well it's pretty interesting though  That you've got a guy  That could afford  To throw a billion dollars at it  And he's thinking of doing  Just that  I'll tell you who I'm  I wonder how that would play out  It's just  Money is all about  Like  To me 
[03:35:30]  Like we got a Mormon  A black dude  And I said this on the special  A Mormon black dude  And a woman  It does sound like  I'm gonna get ready  To tell a fucking bar joke  Like  But  But  Like in California  Who would have thought  That a governor  That used to be  The Terminator  Would actually be a good  He's a pretty good governor  Who would think  That in Jersey  A governor  That used to be a governor  Would be fucking  Drilling holes  In between stalls  Fucking  Peeking  Guys  Whacking their bags  Yeah man  Did you  You talking about  Jim McGreevy  Yeah  Did you see his wife 
[03:36:00]  Standing next to him  Like  My husband sucks dick  Yeah  And she was shocked  Of course she was  She was shell shocked  She's like  This motherfucker  Trags me out here  For this  Right  I thought it was gonna be  A whole thing on  He's a dick sucking  American  What  Wow  You know  And I don't even like  I actually only  The only thing  I'm pretty like  Level headed  I just don't like  When gay people  Compare being gay  To being black  Like  Like  The discrimination  There's a whole bunch  The difference between  Taking dick and picking cotton  Is all I'm saying to you  Like  Like 
[03:36:30]  Like  Your impression  And my impression  Although  You know  Probably have some similarities  Yeah  Ours is a little deeply  More deeply entrenched  Is what I'm saying  We got a couple of hundred years  Of bullshit  So I just  But I don't knock  Nobody's bullshit  But it's just so funny to me  When I see  The  The  The people  Like everybody  When they're the  Downton of society  Everybody says they're black  Like  Well you gotta compare  Well cause you gotta compare  To the one that  You know  Gets the most attention  When there's a problem  Like if there's a 
[03:37:00]  You know  Like a  Problem with  What's his name  Sharpton  No no  Rodney King  You get a Rodney King situation  Who's Rodney King  Oh  You get a Rodney King situation  That's gonna  That was huge news  It started the whole ball rolling  With the riots and everything  So  If you're a group  That wants to seem persecuted  You wanna be able to get  That kind of reaction  Yeah  So you know  It's not gonna work  You're not gonna be able to go  Oh you know  We're just like black people  We  Dairy farmers are the black people  Of alcohol  Can I say how 
[03:37:30]  McGreevy's wife's pussy  Has gotta be the laughing stock  Of all the genders  Other pussies in the locker room  Like while the humans communicate  The other pussies must just look at it  And go  What the fuck were you thinking  Thanks for nothing  Embarrassed us  How low are your miles  Oh  Her vagina was just  All fucking pantied up  And unshaven  I would love to be a fly  On a friggin wall  When she would come out  Of the bathroom  And a little nighty  Honey  And he's 
[03:38:00]  Oh my god  He's sleeping  He's saying yuck  Under his breath  Yeah but you know  Have you ever noticed  The wives  Like  Like even though  Couldn't you have  Anal sex with the wife  You could actually  It's all about  The reach around  There's nothing there  You'd be a good counselor  For that shit  You know what I mean  Just fuck her in the ass  If you're gay  But if he's a big bottom  Here's the thing  She made the strap on  But maybe the strap on  Loses something  I don't know  But maybe he was a big bottom 
[03:38:30]  McGreevy seems like a big bottom  He seems like he likes  Sloppy party bottom  He'd probably like to be  Fucked in the ass  And wave his hands  In fairy fashion  He'd probably like to  Wave them like a fairy  While he was being fucked  Because he's a powerful guy  He's a governor  He had to be a bottom  Pound me  Who was that guy's name  Golan Sippel  Or whatever the guy  That was fucking  Deep dicking him  I bet you  That the other guy  Was a cop  Yeah  Oh my god  You motherfuckers man  I'm so glad  That this has got to be 
[03:39:00]  Illegal some way  Yeah it probably is  I'm sure you can't  I'm sorry I'm not  As active this morning  You can't broadcast this shit  Right  And it actually was shit  We broadcasted it  I'm serious  Literally  Don't make us  Play that again  No  Please  Please don't  I don't want to see it  Just coming back  I do not want to  Fucking see that again  It was kind of funny though  It is funny  And you kind of  Will want to sneak  Another peek at it  At some point  You get desensitized to it  Just to see their reaction  Yeah  Yeah and that's it  To see everybody else's reaction 
[03:39:30]  You gotta do that  It was the most incredible video  I've ever seen  We've told our listeners  Please  If you're gonna watch it  With someone new  Grab a camcorder  And just put the camcorder  On the person that's watching  Because some of that shit  Is so god damn funny  To watch someone's reaction  And just being disgusted  I actually couldn't  Show that to anybody  Because  Like Red  He gets a pass  For that shit  Because everybody thinks  He's like a weird dude  Anyway  He gets a pass  The weirdest shit  In the world  But if I show  Two people shitting 
[03:40:00]  They would wonder  Where I've been  What the fuck  Are you doing  I've seen shit like that  Like Red is like  He just all kind of  Did you go to Thailand  On vacation or something  I don't know  What the fuck  You can't take that shit  Back to the community for us  No  You know  Black culture always winds up  Being adopted by white culture  You know  Dancing  Clothing  Music  Why can't we send something like  Why can't we give you  Two girls  Two girls  One cup  One cup  Shit videos  We want that  To be the white representation 
[03:40:30]  Black people give us the blues  Which became rock and roll  Here's two girls  In one cup  Just shitting  And eating it  Please  As our gift  That's the Brazilians though  That's not white people  That's the Brazilians  The Brazilians like that shit  Absolutely  Yes they do  That's the Brazilian video  The fuck is up in Brazil  Is that Brazilian  Yeah  What's going on in Brazil  I think because the poverty level  Is so high  They get girls to do  The most vile shit for money  For some  They're very poor  Really  Cheap money  And they're naughty  They're very naughty too  Maybe from the  Influx of German people  That were over there  At a certain time too 
[03:41:00]  Maybe  Good point  The Germans  The Germans came over  After World War 2  To kind of  You know  Beat it  Kind of skip that hanging  Why can't they just have  Nice diets  Huh  Why can't they just have  Nice diets  I don't know  Why does it always have to be  That shit doesn't taste good  Maybe there's something  Going on in the food  Something that happens  In your body  Which is just foul shit  It's unfortunate  Yeah  It's unfortunate  Like I could never  Honestly  It's the bad bacteria  I could never  I mean  And I'm not approved  By any stretch of that  Like I like  Pretty freaky shit  Yeah yeah 
[03:41:30]  I could never even imagine  No  Fucking somebody  That ate a pile of shit  I couldn't  I mean  It's beyond even having to say that  And then with  D-D-D-D-D  You ever licking ass?

[03:45:30]  No one's blowing him  No one's helping him out  Marv you've left your bridge  On my nuts  You should've  Oh man  Oh that is just  Get that shit off of there  I swear to god  I was on a plane  And I have a Mac  So when you flip through  Certain things  To find a screensaver  It opens them automatically  And I was on a small plane  With Kenny  And I opened up that picture  Because I have it on my computer  And fuck it  The whole screen became  Lemonparty.org  And there was a guy  About three rows back  I think he was like an ONA fan  And he was laughing 
[03:46:00]  Because he saw  I was really fucking  You know  And I gotta tell you something  Like I've never seen  Like a whole hour of you  And I always thought  You're a pretty funny guy  But the level of your depravity  The sheer  How does he think of the  Like I'm an open dude  But I can't  I go  I don't even know  How he  If you weren't a comedian  You would be some  Yeah  Serial killer  I promise  He knows more about serial killers  Than anyone I know  And it's just like  It'll allow you into going  That's pretty normal  But then you go

[03:47:30]  To raise a stubble  You'll tear your penis  Yeah that stubble is bad  Not that I know  Not that I know  No no  She's got to wax  Or shave  I like it all  I mean I shave everything  So I would like her to  You shave everything  Everything  But I'm not hair  My pubic hair draws in straight  Like a Chinese man's head  You fucking idiot  You weirdo  My pubic hair sucks  I just  Man I just didn't know  That people did shit  I'm totally shaved  Girls like it too  Because it's clean  And it makes you think  Like a little bigger  I'll take whatever I can get  Can you imagine  I wish I would come home 
[03:48:00]  And have you  I woke up the guy  In the corner finally  No he's  No he's  Diabetes mess  And kicking in  He's alright  If I came home  I swear to god  This would happen  If I came home  With my pubic hair shaved  My wife would swear  I got crabs  Crabs yeah  She would swear to god  I've been fucking around  I got crabs  But that's because  It would be not normal for you  Because it's not your  You know what I mean  But I was always  For the last couple years I guess  Yeah  I did when I was 15  I didn't like it  Because it hurt growing back  Trying to jerk off  On a cloth  I had to put a washcloth  Down and jerk off  On it  Yeah that's the only time 
[03:48:30]  I've ever did that  Is like I was  Oh man you are  A sick motherfucker  It's true  You know what I want to do  I got to see your computer  I got to see the shit  You have  You could  He's got it in lockdown  He's going to the FBI  No I have nothing  Nothing illegal  I don't have any kid stuff  Because that's never been my thing  And I have  I don't think I have any  Animal fucking  Except for the one guy in Seattle  Who got killed by getting fucked by the horse  Yeah  That one you have to  You have to  It's mandatory 
[03:49:00]  How come we don't know this stuff  Ray  What is the guy in Seattle  It made the Associated Press  There's a documentary on this guy  He was getting fucked by a horse  There was a farm  On purpose?  Oh yeah  It wasn't an accident  There was a farm  The horse came in  Fuck the sugar cubes  Come here  He was picking up oats  And the horse took advantage  Right  But real fast  There was a farm  Where people could go  And have sex with the animals  Do we have that?  That was the whole purpose  Of the farm  Was it in Tijuana?  No it's in Seattle  Seattle, Washington  Seattle, Washington  And the guy took a horse dick  Bunch of hippies up there 
[03:49:30]  And the guy  What happened was  There was a guy holding  The horse dick  His whole job was to make sure  That this guy only took X amount  Because the human body  Can only handle so much  So the guy  He had to pay the dick out there  Just a little bit of dick  That's all you get  And the guy moved his hands  And the horse pushed all the way in  And that's all they show  Is that the horse comes  But it turns out the guy did die  The guy had to take him  To the hospital  And the guy died  He was killed  Can you explain that  At the hospital man?  Can you imagine your son  Get killed  From getting fucked to death  By a horse?  I know  You probably don't need  To explain it 
[03:50:00]  It's probably obvious  His asshole's this big  And he's got hay in his hair  They probably just know  What happened  You would have to throw away  The Little League trophies  Immediately  If that's the way he went  You're not saving  No Little League trophies  At this point  Pictures  All the pictures get burned  Yeah  What happened to your son?  Long story  He moved  You want to hear a chicken  You want to hear a chicken  Having sex?

What does she have  Four arms  She had eight limbs  Two arms  The upper part's normal 
[03:59:30]  And then the lower half  Is kind of a parasitic twin  And then she doesn't  See how many legs at all  One leg is propped up  She almost like  Thought she was cool  She's like propped  Her arms with her leg  I think she's got  One normal leg  And the other one  Probably needs work  Like one of the creatures  Of a SpongeBob SquarePants  Yeah  Oh my god  The legs look like  That piece you get  In the  When you order  A calamari  Yeah  That isn't good  The piece nobody wants  The piece that no one wants  That's what the legs look like  The legs on it  Are discolored  Come on  I want the nice rings 
[04:00:00]  With the breading on it  I don't want that fucking thing  I don't know what that is  I don't want to eat anything  That I can tell what it was  When it was alive  I like things in pieces  And cubes  I don't want the personality on it  Handy cubes  A fucking head  I don't want a head  Or a cocked shoulder  You know  Or a pointing fucking finger  An accusing finger  I don't want to eat anything  That I know what it was  When it was alive  That's a good rule to follow 
[04:00:30]  Yep  You can't  Man  I don't think  I'm going to come back  Ever been served a fish  That is still a fish  It looks like it  With the tail  And the freaking face  Absolutely  It's creepy  Cut the head off  Not on my head  Actually  Nah  That doesn't bother me  Really?  The fish head and all?  We don't relate to fish at all  That's why  No  That's stupid  They just swim  Goldfish  I told you the fucking funniest thing  Is the massage parlor I go to  They're legit  And then  The fact that he would look at me 
[04:01:00]  I know  They're legit  That's what happened  Now this actually happened to me  A friend of mine who was an LAPD officer  He calls me  He goes  You know that place you go to  On Devin  I shouldn't say the street  But it's closed now  And he goes  Look at this motherfucker  Here on Jerry Springer  They closed it  And  They  So I go  And I watch the news  And the girls  That I used to see  Are walking out  And I sure  I miss May Lee so much  I just watched him  Leading him out  Oh she was so special 
[04:01:30]  I can't even run her down  So if anybody knows her  Please  Have her call me  She was a nimble woman  Let me say that  Really?  Yeah very nimble  But it wasn't  Red has a story  But he's married to your sister  So he's out  He's out on this one  Yeah you're right  You can't tell me that story  He can only tell you stories  He's heard  Right  And he hears a laugh  I'm afraid of mine  Right  This fucking massage parlor  They have a fish tank  It's a little fish tank  And these fucking  Rotten people  Put giant fish  In this little fish  And it's really funny 
[04:02:00]  Just to watch these  Dumb fish  Just kind of bumping  Into each other  And like  Just meeting in the middle  And going  Alright I'll go back here  And they're turning around  They're just a bunch of  Dumb fucks  But they can't kill themselves  Because they have no hands  It's the projects for fish  The projects  That's exactly what it is  They're all crammed in there  They feel ridiculous  They're hoping one day  There's something  Past the glass  Every day they try  They keep bumping  Their dumb fish faces  On it like  Shit  Alright  Here's another  Runner up line of the day 
[04:02:30]  Probably people  That are even slower  Now she's got to slow down  And start itching her leg  And adjusting this and that  Just to get back  Into last place  Pants must have  Smelt like a slaughterhouse  That's how she crossed  That finish line  Yeek  That really made me laugh  We were talking about  The last runner  In the New York City  Marathon  She finally crossed the line  28 hours  Every year she does it  For attention  She always finishes last  On purpose  28 hours  Yeah she's just very slow 
[04:03:00]  And they  Your newborn child  Could do better  God damn  I could have crawled  Exactly  Yeah  We said exactly that  But she gets attention  Every year for being last  And she knows  That's her whole deal  What does she stop  Eat  She slows down  If she knows people  Are being slower than her  So we hate it  Because she's  Getting some attention  Is she fit  No  Not at all  Maybe she's doing  The best she can  She's built like  John Goodman  Kind of fat  And irritating  Stupid curly hair  You'll hate her on site  Believe me 
[04:03:30]  Bodogfantasy.net  Brings you  The line of the day  Oh my god  Here  Comes  The line of the day  The line of the day  The line of the day  The line of the day  Stupid  His friend turns around  Hey Murray  My throat is cut  And then Murray's like  Well that's not why I'm here  I have a wedding to go to  Even out of context 
[04:04:00]  That's hilarious  Jimmy's cow material  Even I don't even understand  See we don't like to explain  The line of the day  For the most part  We try not to  I was just talking about  How stupid cows are  And how animals go to  The slaughter line  One after the other  Without questioning it  And one cow  Sees his friend  Get his throat cut  And then doesn't run  He just stands there  Like something's gonna be different  You fucking assholes  They deserve it  Why even put him  And just cut that throat  To the middle of the field 
[04:04:30]  And then move  I think  And then I want it cubed  That's what I want  I don't want to  Yeah definitely  Any recognizable part  Alright so  DL Town Hall Saturday  Thank you man  I've had a wonderful time  As always man  Very cool man  Yeah Ticketmaster  Town Hall's a great venue  It's a great show  If you guys get bored  You want to come back  You're in town all week right  Absolutely  Come on back if you want  No pressure  But Fred decided to be back  We leave tomorrow  We leave today  More video  I got more  We could have had more
