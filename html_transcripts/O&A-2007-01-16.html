<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with chaotic banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, who introduced himself as a "naked whore."  Early discussion included a darkly humorous reference to an "insurance-covered rape" and a cynical assessment of the Golden Globe Awards, focusing on the predictable winners like Martin Scorsese, Helen Mirren (for *The Queen*), and Forrest Whitaker.  The hosts provided commentary on these winners' careers and speculated on the reasons for their awards, intertwined with detailed discussion of *The Queen*'s plot and their critical opinions.  Further film discussion encompassed *Borat*, *Dreamgirls*, *The Last King of Scotland*, and *Jackass 2*, with accompanying irreverent comments and a debate on the merits of sequels.  Television shows like *Grey's Anatomy*, *Gilmore Girls*, and *30 Rock* were also analyzed, with humorous disagreements.  A listener, Todd, called in to complain about being forced to watch "chick shows" by his girlfriend, leading to a humorous discussion about his perceived loss of masculinity and DVR struggles.

The show then shifted to other topics: Fidel Castro's failing health (compared to a mangy dog); Ryan Seacrest's perceived attempts to appear heterosexual; a graphic anecdote about the death of Saddam Hussein's half-brother; and a YouTube video of an intoxicated Paula Abdul. Opie shared a childhood story about defacing a valuable baseball card, leading to a personal revelation about recurring behavioral patterns. This transitioned to a caller, Phillip, recounting his brother trading a Babe Ruth card for fake Oakleys, sparking a discussion on the value of rare baseball cards, notably the Honus Wagner card.  Opie further elaborated on his childhood card-defacing incident.

This segued into a segment where Opie, Anthony, and guest Bill Burr shared stories about acquaintances involved in crimes, ranging from robberies to murder.  Anthony recounted the death of a friend involved in a Long Island crime spree; another friend, Jimmy, shared a less violent story. Opie detailed a shocking murder-suicide in his former childhood home, including the deaths of two children in his old bedroom. Burr described a high school classmate who bludgeoned a freshman to death.  The conversation then pivoted to David Caruso's acting on *CSI: Miami*, illustrated with audio clips highlighting his perceived poor delivery.  The hosts discussed the "Hold your Wii for a Wii" radio contest that resulted in a listener's death from water intoxication, exploring the potential legal ramifications for the radio station. A nurse caller offered medical input on water intoxication.

The next segment started with a sexually suggestive anecdote about a nurse nicknamed "Nurse Heather," followed by a discussion of the death of Jennifer Strange, a contestant on a competing radio station's contest.  A statement from the station's management announcing the morning show's suspension was played, and the hosts speculated on potential lawsuits.  This transitioned into a humorous exchange with a caller, Phil, about Anthony's perceived know-it-all attitude. The show then covered a news story about near-misses on slot machines, leading to a discussion of casino cheating methods.  Further discussion included more audio clips of the intoxicated Paula Abdul, speculation about the cause of her slurred speech, a case of missing Missouri boys and their kidnapper, and a revisit of the hosts' early, intoxicated radio work, including their very first show.  The broadcast concluded with a description of their daily "walkover" to their next broadcast location, including humorous banter and a physical altercation outside the studio. A "dump report" revealed Anthony received an FCC violation for an inappropriate joke.

A segment featured the hosts listening to a 1994 recording of one of their early shows with guests Joe and Anthony from the band Rotgut.  Opie expressed significant discomfort with his younger self's performance, describing himself negatively.  The segment included portions of the old show, punctuated by their reactions, arguments, laughter, and the playing of several songs, including a Rotgut parody about O.J. Simpson.  A caller, Mickey J. from Montauk, briefly participated.  Opie and Anthony's increasing discomfort led them to question continuing to play the old recording.

The final segment covered various interconnected topics:  their early career, including a situation involving plagiarism by a morning DJ at BAB; reminiscing about radio personality Jerry Mortier and his "Jerry's Gin Joint" segment;  criticism of a Fox 5 News *American Idol* spoof featuring Mike Woods, frequently using the term "douche"; listener calls, one asking for Yogi Bear's pal's name and another about women's attraction to Italian men; a discussion about a colleague's illness (possibly Tom); overwhelmingly negative listener feedback; discussion of a listener's MySpace email and Bill Burrâ€™s DC Improv performance; audio clips of poorly performed celebrity songs (specifically Telly Savalas); negative comments about Rachel Ray; listener feedback, including a listener's anecdote about a rally supporting the show; review of listener-submitted pictures of Travis, a show employee, leading to discussion of his appearance and past involvement in a cult; continued commentary on listener feedback; discussion of a cereal; and comments on XM radio music.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the "line of the day" and sponsors.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  Ovi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance. 
[00:00:30]  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  But with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you 
[00:01:00]  for the shock of...  My baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story 
[00:01:30]  never before told on the screen.  Oh.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Ovi and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Oh, you're going to have to wait for that one.  I'm sorry.  But you're going to have to wait.  Please tell me there's more of that.  Oh, there's about 14 clips.  But you're going to have to wait.  My baby is black.  Wow.  You're going to have to wait just a little bit.  But we'll get to that. 
[00:02:00]  That's good.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We're sitting around here.  There's so much going on.  Fidel Castro is pretty much dying.  What?  He looks fine.  They're showing him on TV.  They said he's had three operations and he's not looking good.  He's gravely ill.  Doesn't he look like one of those mangy dogs around someone's house that you know that  you just look at and go, oh, that dog's life is about over.  The dog...  The patches are gone.  It just stinks. 
[00:02:30]  You can shampoo the dog as many times as you want, but it just still looks like it's not  clean.  And it's beyond even shampooing.  You can't do it because the vet said its skin is too sensitive.  Big clumps of hair missing scabs on it.  He also looks like one of those old monkeys in the zoo.  Yeah, the old chimpanzee.  Not the cute little one in the engineer outfit with the little toot toot hat on.  You know, the old one.  Turn gray a little bit.  The hair gets a little longer.  Yeah, and the caretakers...  A little mangier.  The caretakers are all just like, he's been here the longest and he's settled down now. 
[00:03:00]  He's mellowed with age.  Oh, there it is.  The Castro Death Watch.  Oh, and now it looks like it's just a matter of time.  So that's going on.  Then you got the Golden Globes.  And I was telling Jimmy just before the show, I personally watch these award shows thinking  I need to watch it for our radio show.  I need to know who's winning all these dopey awards so we can be informed and do a whole 
[00:03:30]  like Golden Globes wrap up on our show.  That's what like the two guys and the whole show do.  They sit, watch.  Well, part of our show we want to feel informed.  Yeah.  But then I sit here and go, who gives a crap?  No one.  Nothing happens on these shows anymore.  Nothing.  It used to be unpredictable when these award shows first started.  Now they're all scared that someone might throw out a curse word.  So they just shut up.  They put them on a huge delay. 
[00:04:00]  They make sure everybody's like prompted as to what to say.  So they stick to their stupid teleprompter and nothing happens.  No excitement.  Scorsese won, I guess.  Did he win?  Yeah.  Yeah, Scorsese won something.  I don't know.  But that doesn't mean anything.  Or did he win?  They keep saying, could it be a prelude to the Oscar?  No, it won't be.  They'll shun him again.  The genius that has put out such great movies and just been crapped on for years. 
[00:04:30]  I think finally they're going to give him something.  No, I don't think so.  He should get something.  He's old enough now where they just got to do the pity award.  You know what, though?  Departed, good movie.  I liked it.  It's all short, though, right?  But it's not the one he should get the Oscar for.  For the love of God, look at the other great movies.  Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull.  He should have won for Raging Bull.  Yeah, I mean, those were brilliantly directed movies.  And what, just because they feel he's due, they'll give him an Oscar for a movie that isn't quite up to par on those? 
[00:05:00]  Not even feels that he's due.  It's just that he's now older.  Yeah.  It's hard to bring him out and give him his stupid Oscar.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Like, he's just, he's due.  He's got all these golden globes.  We were talking about it in the office, too.  He's probably got, like, Mantle with the golden globes on it and the People's Choice Awards and the big Kids' Choice surfboard in the corner and all that crap. 
[00:05:30]  The golden popcorn thing.  The big golden MTV popcorn thing and just looks at him and just spits on him.  He looks at the shelf and goes, what's missing?  Hmm.  The only one that matters!  The second his hand gets on an Oscar, those pieces of crap are just going to be boxed up or thrown.  Yeah, he's just going to do that.  We did not clean it up!  Just leave it on the floor.  Make them doorstops and paperweights. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, well.  So, I don't know.  We got all the winners, but watch.  Best picture.  Babble.  Babble.  I heard it was good.  Not much of a reaction.  Didn't see it.  Because it's like, who cares?  All right.  Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt's movie, I guess.  It's like a, what do they call that cast?  A ensemble.  Ensemble.  I was going to say composite cast.  I'm a little sleepy today.  Sketch of a cast they made.  Yeah.  It's a composite.  Who is this actor? 
[00:06:30]  Looks familiar, but the eyes.  Can you change the eyes?  And then best actress drama, Helen Mirren for The Queen.  I saw The Queen on the plane.  Actually, we haven't even talked about this.  You and Lindsay were kind of bonding across the aisle.  Yes.  Because you were watching The Queen.  Your chick was asleep.  Lindsay was watching The Queen.  And her chick was asleep, me.  And what did you think of The Queen? 
[00:07:00]  It was pretty good.  See, I thought it was a period piece, but it's a movie about Lady Di?  Yeah, it's about when Lady Di, the Queen Lady Di, or the Princess Di, not the drunk, babbling ass that's on this program occasionally.  Oh, right, right.  When Princess Diana died and how the royal family reacted to it as opposed to how the newly elected Tony Blair reacted to it.  And apparently, based on this movie, Tony Blair kind of bailed the royal family out. 
[00:07:30]  If it wasn't for him, they were hating the way the royal family was just not saying a word about Princess Di's death.  They were clueless.  Princess Di's death.  They were clueless as to how to work it.  As far as how famous she was and how loved she was by the people.  They looked at it like, hey, this bitch ran off.  You know, she's not the princess of Wales anymore.  So why should the royal family give her any tribute in her death? 
[00:08:00]  And they're looking around and don't realize, like, everyone in the world is freaking out that this woman's dead.  And they're not saying anything.  And they're not saying a peep.  And the Queen, whoever, what's the actress's name?  Helen Mirren.  I'm sure she's a dame.  Gotta give her credit, man.  She pulled it off.  The cold, just, bleh, the Queen, just an awful old bitty.  And the guy that played Tony Blair did a good job, too.  I thought it was a good movie. 
[00:08:30]  Lindsay was telling me that, Tony.  Not one I would have.  Believe me, if I wasn't trapped a couple of miles up in an aluminum tube watching this, I probably would have opted out.  They gotta get better movies on the flights.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  It's, oh, we've flown so much in the last year, and there's never a movie I want to watch.  Yeah, it's not.  They never announce the movie, and you go, oh, my God, this is great.  Thank God.  Let me get my headphones out.  It's just not.  Let me get my earbuds.  Yeah, the earbuds.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:00]  Headphones, please.  I don't want to miss the beginning.  Right.  It's side splitters.  It's always some crap.  I went on a flight one time, and there's a guy, they were watching one of the Jackie Chan movies with, what was the movies he did?  The cop movies?  Oh, the ones with, what's his name?  Yeah, Rush Hour.  I didn't have my headphones on.  I just saw this guy watching, and I hear him laughing loudly at every little sight gag, and I wanted to open the plane door and pull him out.  Kick him in the ass and watch him plummet to his death. 
[00:09:30]  Confused with his headphones still on.  I just thought, hey, what happened?  I was just watching a movie.  Yeah, it's just the worst movies.  So, thumbs up or down on The Queen?  I give it a thumbs up.  Really?  Yeah, I thought it was good.  I heard.  You have no way out of where you are, and it's on, and that's the only bit of entertainment.  Or, if there's a baby crying behind you, and you want to muffle the noise, I recommend The Queen. 
[00:10:00]  I heard there's a weird scene where Tony Blair's in his flat, wearing just like a soccer jersey or something, like a regular guy, and he's like the prime minister.  Just elected prime minister, and he's got like a soccer jersey on that says Blair on the back.  Oh, yeah, that's what it was, Blair.  He's a young guy, you know?  Name on the back.  Yeah, he's a young guy, and especially then, newly elected, and he was going in for his first meeting with the Queen, and they're telling him the protocol and how you're supposed to bow and do this, and sits in front of her, and he's a little nervous. 
[00:10:30]  And she talks about how many prime ministers she's sat in front of, and it just intimidates him more.  And then later on, he starts really pressuring the Queen and the royal family through her contacts, like, hey, you idiots have to realize you've got to do something, or you're going to lose the English people.  They were turning on the royal family at that point, and then she came out and placed flowers.  They were talking about all the flowers in front of the palace. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  How people, remember how deep all those flowers were?  It was at least, what, 20 feet away from the fence?  And she just goes, oh, have them removed.  And then someone goes, well, perhaps we should use the rear entrance for the time being.  And she's just, whatever, you know, just, she was just like ready to just bulldoze all people's hearts and love, and it's great. 
[00:11:30]  You've got to love that.  Out of touch, old bitty.  You've got to love that.  Now I think I might want to see this stupid movie.  Yeah, you should see it.  I had no desire whatsoever, but.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  All right.  Then you got, well, I told you guys about The Last King of Scotland.  Have you guys seen it yet?  No.  I haven't seen that one.  It's a movie about Idi Amin, and Forrest Whitaker won Best Actor in a Drama Last.  By the way, I've got to put out a, I haven't seen that one yet.  I haven't seen that one yet.  I've got a copy.  I mean.  I do. 
[00:12:00]  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Careful.  No, dude, we're in a position with our careers.  We've got screener copies now.  I'm not copying anything or passing it on.  We get screener copies.  We're part of the academy.  I know.  When the little thing flashes across the bottom, I pay attention to it.  We copy them and sell them on the walkover.  Right.  We should do that.  We should get just the big, like, the big bags they carry around and just sell bootlegged videos. 
[00:12:30]  One of these days, we should just go on the street as those Nigerians with stuff to sell.  Watchies, watchies, watchies.  It's amazing.  All right.  So, Forrest Whitaker, I think, is going to, ah, whatever.  Who cares what I think about this crap?  I'm not even going to finish that sentence.  I just went off about the queen.  I know.  Best picture, musical, or comedy, Dreamgirls.  All right, moving on.  Not quite in the demo for that, I don't think.  I should be shot for this, but Eddie Murphy looks really good. 
[00:13:00]  I watched his acceptance speech, and I actually said to somebody at the bar, he looks really good.  I realize I'm a fat girl.  He looks like he's always looked.  Yeah, that's kind of creepy.  What the hell is going on?  Well, they say black don't crack, so.  Dude.  Oh, you've never heard that?  The plan?  You've never heard that?  Of course I've heard it.  I'm kidding.  We're just not supposed to say it.  Jeez.  It's Christmas dinner.  What's wrong with you?  They don't mind that stereotype, right?  They don't.  Apparently, there's something in that melanin. 
[00:13:30]  And, uh.  You're from aging or something.  And I was reading in one of the papers today that, uh, what's her name?  The lead in Dreamgirls is making American Idol look bad because she's an American Idol reject.  Oh, and she won Best Supporting Actress.  She won.  They're saying she's going to win an Oscar.  This is one of the biggest movies in years.  And American Idol said, ugh, away with you.  She was, uh, yeah, the American people didn't deem her worthy.  Jennifer Hudson.  Thank you, uh, E-Rock. 
[00:14:00]  And who did she lose out to?  Fantasia.  Fantasia.  Who they can't even make a goddamn TV movie about.  It's better to not win American Idol.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, it starts tonight with the dumb audition.  You do better, um, as a runner-up or just somebody with a little bit of talent.  Yeah.  All right.  Enough about Dreamgirls.  I'm sick of hearing, one night only, one night only.  Keep singing.  I'll do the, uh, Axl Rose version.  Dancing.  Uh, Best, uh, we don't have to go through all these, but Best Actress, uh, Comedy, Meryl Streep, 
[00:14:30]  The Devil Wears Prada.  I will never see that movie.  Best Actor, Comedy, Borat, of course.  Uh, Sasha Baron Cohen won that.  He wasn't going to be nominated for anything.  Like, people thought he wouldn't win any, any kind of award.  Really?  Acting, yeah.  Yeah, he won for Best Comedy.  He wasn't acting?  Uh, Best Supporting Actress.  All that doesn't, well, Dreamgirls.  He's giving a cacta.  Jennifer Hudson won for, uh, Best Supporting Actor.  Eddie Murphy, Best Supporting Actor for Dreamgirls.  Yeah, uh, Martin Scorsese won for The Departed. 
[00:15:00]  Uh, we knew that, right?  Best Director.  And then it gets down to all these who-gives-a-crap categories.  I like Borat, but, um, I, I wish I would have seen it sooner.  Why?  I saw it after too much hype.  Too much hype and too much exposure.  It didn't live up to the hype?  Nah, it didn't live up to the hype and too much exposure.  There were some really funny moments in it and stuff, but, uh, you know, I had seen the  character so much.  I mean, they, they, they were parading him around everywhere doing that.  So it kind of like took away from it.  Yeah.  It's still funny. 
[00:15:30]  The best part, I think, is when, um, they have to stay with the Jewish family.  God damn, is that funny?  And he's convinced that Jews can shape-shift.  And, and in the middle of the night, it's like a bed and breakfast thing almost.  And they're upstairs.  With an old Jewish couple.  An old Jewish couple.  And he's talking about, they're just sitting on the bed horrified.  And a couple of cockroaches come under the door.  And he said that they had shape-shifted into cockroaches.  And they're trying to distract the cockroaches by throwing money at the cockroaches. 
[00:16:00]  As they run out of the place in horror.  He's a funny dude, bro.  He's a funny dude.  The way he was bashing the Jews.  You know, um, uh, you know what movie I haven't seen?  And I, I said to myself, why haven't you seen this movie yet?  What is wrong with you?  And it was on in the hotel in Vegas.  And when we were out in LA.  I still haven't seen Jackass 2.  Oh yeah, you gotta see that.  It's made for me.  And I still haven't seen this stupid movie.  Stupid, stupid fun.  But I don't know why.  Every once in a while there's a movie that comes out. 
[00:16:30]  And I just, I'm like, that's what I want.  I gotta be first online.  And then six months later I'm still going to myself, why aren't you seeing that movie?  Because when there's a two after something, it normally sucks.  That's why you didn't want to see it.  There's an intake that goes, ugh, that's not gonna be good.  Yeah.  They came, they, they, they definitely, uh, pulled it off though.  So there, there are some parts though that I think are a little staged, which kind of  like, yeah, but the, the stuff, just the blatant pain they inflict on each other.  The best part is the doorbell with the, the big inflatable, it's almost like an airbag 
[00:17:00]  that comes out and punches people in the face.  Oh my God.  They ring the bell and boom, they just get knocked out.  Very, uh, very funny movie.  I don't know why you didn't see it.  Especially when it's on in the hotel.  Yeah, I don't get that.  I gotta, uh, check that out.  Golden Globes, TV, Do We Care, Best Series, Grey's Anatomy.  None of us do, uh, watch that.  Who watches that?  My chick watches that.  Who watches it?  My chick watches it every single episode. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Is that a medical show?  Uh, yeah.  Another medical show.  Well, poof.  Heebie-jeebies.  Making, like, ER look, uh, very old and dated.  Don't watch it.  It is.  And they got all that moody music.  I hear moody music.  That's all I hear.  Because as soon as she turns that on, I'm like, oh, time to get my PSP in Luminous 2.  Done.  Time to play another two hours of Luminous 2.  Gazing at me into a series about a rest area.  It's that.  She watches the Gilmore Girls, and I'm like, ah, so out. 
[00:18:00]  So out.  Time to go do something.  The Gilmore Girls?  Exactly.  What is that even about?  I don't know.  It's not like.  You sat through and watched an episode with her.  Don't say you haven't.  I watch Supernatural, okay?  Because my chick watches it.  I've seen episodes.  Yeah, but it's.  I don't make sure I catch it, but, you know.  But Supernatural sounds like a TV show you'd be into.  There's a couple, like, it's, the thing is, it's very X-Files-ish, but it's, you know, 
[00:18:30]  with two hot guys.  So it's, eh.  I think I'm right.  You can't sit through the hotness?  I can't.  I get so frustrated.  They're right there on my TV screen, yet I can't touch them.  But you do sit sometimes and watch these dopey shows with your chick, because, you know,  they're watching it.  They're on.  You're in bed or something.  You're hanging out in the living room, wherever the TV is, and they watch it, and you watch 
[00:19:00]  an episode.  Gilmore Girls.  Fruity show.  I have taken a peek at Gilmore Girls.  All right.  What's it about?  I don't know.  It's something about ice society.  What's Gilmore?  Is that their name?  Where they live?  Like, this is how far off I am.  I think the Gilmore Girls.  You know about the Gilmore Girls?  Who's raising their hand?  Ah, one of the interns.  I'd look shocked now.  That's Craig.  Looks like a deer in headlights.  Is Craig is your name?  I don't even know.  He gets my breakfast all the time.  He brings a lot of great stuff for the show.  I don't know the names, unless they're wearing tags. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, what's up, Craig?  What's the Gilmore Girls about?  It's about a single mom.  Single mom and a daughter.  And what do they do?  Bring home guys?  No, do women's stuff.  Do women's stuff.  Read tampon directions, things like that.  Love it already.  Shop and have abortions.  I love it.  He's seen the show, and he can't even tell you.  I think it's about high society, or some lady runs a house for debutante wannabes. 
[00:20:00]  Get out of here.  That's my guess.  No?  And I've seen the show about four or five times.  Four or five times now you've seen it.  Not the whole show, but just a piece.  Excuse me, if I may read back what you said earlier, I have never seen the program.  Do you admit to saying this?  Now four or five times.  Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.  I've looked up a few times, but I don't really...  You've looked up a few times?  I don't really...  From what?  Your knitting?  Packet?  Let's get a chick on the stupid phone. 
[00:20:30]  Why get a chick when we got one on mic?  It went from...  I took a peek to the DVD extras were not what I expected.  All right.  All right.  I don't know, though.  I think it's some lady that runs some kind of house.  Uh-huh.  And the girls that are fortunate enough to live in this house are called the Gilmore Girls,  and they're kind of like debutantes, high society type of people.  All of a sudden, you know a lot about this.  But I pray I'm wrong.  Somebody says, catch the Gilmore Girls tonight at 8 p.m. on The CW. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  I didn't know.  I had nary a clue what the Gilmore Girls were about.  Although I do know, Sebastian Bach walked on the plane, first class.  Everybody was looking at him on my flight.  I think it was back from L.A.  Yeah.  And he was wearing a Gilmore Girls backpack.  And I looked, and I went to my girlfriend.  I go, only...  There are very few people that could get away with that, and Sebastian Bach is one of them. 
[00:21:30]  He's just a rocker.  You know, he's just banged his way through his career.  And could you imagine walking on a plane with a Gilmore Girls backpack?  Yeah.  This male stewardess would call you a fag.  All right.  Well, Joe watches the Gilmore Girls.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Do I have the plot of the show right?  The plot is the mom is she's like a single mom who comes from a really rich family. 
[00:22:00]  And her mom is always on her case because she's all hip.  And the granddaughter is always in conflict with the mother because she doesn't know whether  or not she should be all high society with the grandmother or, you know, think free and modern like her mom.  I watched one episode.  Wait, so there's no debutantes?  I couldn't stop watching it.  I got hooked on it.  I don't even know how it happened.  No.  No, man. 
[00:22:30]  I lost my manhood to this show.  I don't know what happened.  So there's no debutantes and they're not living among a bunch of other girls called the Gilmore Girls?  No.  Wow.  The daughter.  Wow.  The daughter lives with the grandmother.  I guess the Gilmore Girls are the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter, right?  The mother and the daughter.  Well, what about the...  The grandmother is like a real biatch and she's always trying to make everybody live like rich people.  And that's the conflict in the show.  Sebastian Bach is on Gilmore Girls.  Is he on it? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Someone is telling us that.  Sheep Lover on XM, calling from New Jersey or whatever.  Opie is way off on Gilmore Girls.  It's about a mother and daughter who are best friends.  That's the short explanation.  And Sebastian Bach is on Gilmore Girls.  Wait, what's Opie handing me?  I didn't hand you that.  You can go to the CW website and purchase the outfits, accessories they wear on each episode?  Really, Opie?  They sit on...  You can't get away with that anymore.  Every morning we're broadcast on Pal Talk.  Damn you, Pal Talk. 
[00:23:30]  Damn you.  No one saw me hand you anything.  I even shuffled papers to make it look more real.  All right, let's get through this crap.  So then Best Actress, The Closer with Kira Sedgwick.  I don't watch that show.  Best Actor.  You know me, Dead Set Against Medical Shows.  I get what they call the heebie-jeebies.  I feel faint sometimes when they talk about your guts and things that are wrong with them. 
[00:24:00]  I hate it.  So I never watched ER or anything like that.  I was always a NYPD blue guy.  You know, cop shows, things like that.  But I watched a couple episodes of House and didn't give me heebie-jeebies.  It just made me laugh my ass off.  Because it's exactly how we goof on it.  This stupid house and some wacky disease comes in.  Which, by the way, none of them ever seem concerned with catching anything.  They have no idea what it is, how it's spread, if it's airborne or touch or saliva. 
[00:24:30]  And they're just trotting around like there's no problem.  Wouldn't you be in a space suit if you had to deal with some of these people that are bleeding from every orifice and shaking?  They're immune.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, you're a doctor.  You're immune to everything.  And then the House goes with these wacky diagnoses.  He'd be sued for malpractice every episode.  So it's so ridiculous that I wound up not getting the heebie-jeebies.  And it wasn't, you know, bad to watch.  It was kind of funny. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Oh, but he won again.  They love him.  I've never seen an episode.  But love the House.  Ugly Betty won for best comedy.  Aww.  She's hot, too.  She's not a bad-looking girl.  She's what they call funny-looking cute.  It's like funny-looking cute and the braces and stuff and the glasses and she's all kind of...  Well, they ugly her up.  They throw the glasses on, the braces and...  If they had any courage, they would have gotten a real slob for that part. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, we've talked about that in the past.  You don't get a girl that's funny-looking cute.  How do you tell a girl that's the movie, the show she's starring in, though?  Like, you got the part.  What's it called?  Ah.  Um.  Not as attractive as some other girl's Betty.  And I guess that's it.  The rest of the stuff is who cares.  Oh, no, no, no.  Best Actor Comedy.  Alec Baldwin.  30 Rock.  Do you guys watch 30 Rock yet?  Uh, no.  The show is hilarious.  Alec Baldwin is hilarious. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Tracy Morgan is hilarious.  Tina Fey.  She's a good writer.  A really good writer.  I guess this is her little baby, but her acting stinks.  Yeah.  But the rest of the guys are great.  Their acting is great.  And the show is great.  The writing's really good.  Is it about SNL or another sketch show?  It's SNL, basically.  Actually, what's his name there?  The big guy with the gray hair.  You know, he's part of that project. 
[00:26:30]  Lorne Michaels.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Oh.  He's part of that whole 30 Rock thing.  Who's supposed to be like him in Alec Baldwin?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  I have watched that.  And he's secretly dating Connelisa Rice on the show.  It's hilarious.  He's taking phone calls from her and he has to quickly, like, hang up.  That's kind of funny.  And, oh, yeah, Judah Freelander's on the show.  He's one of, like, the writers, so he's hanging out around the table coming up with skits.  But all of a sudden, as, you know, the show's going, you'll hear in the background what the next skit is for this 30 Rock, 
[00:27:00]  and it's just some ridiculous thing you would, you know, see on SNL or something.  Yeah.  And you almost want to see the skit because it sounds like it could be cool.  I don't have a good example, but whatever.  I'm going to have to do a DVR of that.  No, check out 30 Rock.  Watch nothing live anymore.  It's definitely cool.  Todd in Pittsburgh, stay right there.  He says, girlfriend forces me to watch all those girl shows.  All right.  See, we're not alone, man.  You're at home.  It's the middle of the winter, and you've got to share the TV. 
[00:27:30]  It's kind of how I became familiar.  Familiar.  With what?  With a certain show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Oh, boy.  Familiar with it.  Not must see, not catch every episode, not know everything,  but I would be known to sit down and perhaps catch an episode while I felt a tingling in my vagina.  On Sunday, there was some great football on, and I'm in the middle of watching, you know, all the games. 
[00:28:00]  Man up.  Go ahead.  No, it's not even that.  I'm not trying to, you know, go down that road, but all of a sudden, Lindsay's like, ah, football.  Oh, God, yeah, you know, you know the deal.  I'm talking to a million guys right now that have been through this.  I go, Gilmore Girls.  Oh.  Tit for tat, my friend.  That's right.  I hear you.  Even Steven.  Yes.  You want your girl to react to football, though.  You don't want a dikey girlfriend.  Like, ah, the Cowboys defense hasn't been the same.  Right, exactly. 
[00:28:30]  Exactly.  Knows more than you do.  Just emasculates you with her sports knowledge.  Jimmy makes a great point.  Yeah, you want them to be kind of like, maybe sort of interested, but not like, you know.  You want them to ask questions that you can answer, you know, about sports.  Oh, that?  Let me tell you about offsides.  Come on.  You don't want to correct me.  They should run here.  Shut up, you queer.  What do you know?  Obviously, they got a pass. 
[00:29:00]  What?  Yeah, that's definitely the girl you don't want.  God, Jimmy, that's a great point.  A few more girls watching, girl.  All right, just getting started.  Don't forget, a little later this morning.  Nothing you have ever seen before, and nothing you have ever heard before, will prepare you  for the shock of My Baby is Black.  Starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. 
[00:29:30]  The motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, old story never  before told on the screen.  Yes.  Yes.  Never before told on the screen.  We got 15 of those clips.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Oh, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:30:00]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We haven't talked to Pittsburgh in a while.  Let's say hi to Todd.  What's up, Todd?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey, Todd.  Yeah, so since I moved in with my girlfriend about six months ago, I have been inundated  and forced to watch all these chick shows, and I've completely lost my whole physical 
[00:30:30]  manhood as far as the TV goes.  What shows you got to watch?  The Gilmore Girls, The Desperate Housewives, What About Brian, Brothers and Sisters.  What About Brian?  What About Brian?  I couldn't even, if my life depended on it, I couldn't even tell you what that's about.  I couldn't tell you if it's a drama or a comedy.  I couldn't tell you who's in it.  I couldn't tell you what network it's on.  The sad part is, because of all this crap, I can pretty much tell you the plot of all 
[00:31:00]  these shows, and I have a fairly good idea of what's going on now.  What About Brian is on ABC, and I think it's 10 o'clock on Sunday nights, maybe, or Monday  nights.  I forget which one.  Welcome to the What About Brian guide at TV.com.  In its second season, this one-hour drama is loaded with stars, and then they name the  stars.  No, it's more of a comedy, but it's still for the stars.  A group of friends.  He's the last single guy in his group of friends.  Three couples at different stages who live in Los Angeles. 
[00:31:30]  Who plays Brian?  They are excited for Brian to join their club as married people.  Couple number one, his best friend Adam, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Sounds great.  Who plays Brian?  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  Some guy named Barry Watson.  So it's not even like a star?  No.  Okay.  I get to watch The 7th Heaven, The O.C., Reba, Extreme Makeover Home Edition.  Reba!  Reba! 
[00:32:00]  Dude, you gotta reclaim your masculinity.  You know you're a poo-ha, and you're whipped, right?  No, that's the worst part.  Dude, you're whipped.  I'll tell you why.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll tell you why you're whipped.  You named so many shows, there's no time to watch one lousy guy show.  That's every...  Again, I admit it, I swear to God, there's two shows that I take a peek at because, you  know...  Oh, now there's two.  Well, Grey's Anatomy because of the music's in the background, all emotional, you know. 
[00:32:30]  And the Gilmore Girls, I think that's about it.  The other shows, we are in agreement.  The Office, My Name is Earl, 30 Rock.  I have no problem watching those shows.  I still watch all those.  The worst part is I have to videotape those with an actual VCR and then go back and watch  them after she goes to bed.  I go to bed at like 3 o'clock every morning just so I can stay up and watch all these crap.  See?  Be kind.  Rewind.  Jesus.  It's in 1985?  Yeah, that proves it, though. 
[00:33:00]  You just listed 10 or 12 chick shows.  Yeah, the DVR's killing me because whatever she can't watch, it's not the same time she  she DVRs and watches the next stage.  Listen how whipped he is.  He's got a DVR.  But he's got to tape stuff on a VCR that he wants to watch because the DVR's full of  her crap.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not allowed to touch the DVR.  Forget about it.  Oh, the DVR world is great.  But sometimes you get stuck where, like, Gilmore Girls is taping and then another chick show  and you're sitting there like, you mean this show will begin taping in two minutes? 
[00:33:30]  You're like, oh, no.  I've got to sacrifice something.  I mean, you're taping two chick shows right now so I can't change the channel to watch  something else?  No.  Yeah, I mean, I watch a ton of Discovery and I just have to videotape it all and watch  it when I can.  Sometimes, you know, late at night, be watching something.  Say I'm watching Aliens, watching a movie, and the DVR will go, in two minutes, something  will start taping and I'll be like, all right, we'll just cancel that show.  And then you play the, I don't know what happened. 
[00:34:00]  It's like, oh, this damn DVR.  It just must have screwed up.  We've got to call the cable company.  I don't understand.  Oh, cable vision.  I've done that.  She might be.  I'm not going to stop watching my movie.  I've done that.  She might not be, you know, in the house and all of a sudden I'm like, no one's looking  like, cancel.  Yeah.  I'm a real man.  Baby, I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:34:30]  I only did it once.  And I know it was a rerun.  That's the only reason I did it.  I tuned in first.  I wouldn't even think about it.  I'd get killed.  Dude, you're a bastard.  I feel bad for you, man.  Yeah, we get in huge fights about it all the time.  And I got in a fight about it last night.  I just got to watch the red carpet, Golden Globes of Ryan Seacrest for a couple hours,  and then the Golden Globes themselves.  And it's like.  Well, who else saw Ryan Seacrest last night acting like he likes women?  I mean, come on.  I mean, this is my opinion, obviously.  I have no effing idea. 
[00:35:00]  But, you know, he was trying.  Ah, rumors have been thrown around.  He was trying a little too hard to tell everyone how hot Jessica Biel is.  Whoa, wow.  Really going out on a limb there.  Yeah.  Is she hot?  I never noticed.  I really never noticed.  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where she's running around in a little T-shirt.  And one of the chicks during the red carpet ceremonies was kind of hinting, like, you know,  about some actor and how, you know, cute he is, whatever.  And Ryan actually went, oh, I don't go that way. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, when you have to just blatantly.  That's what I was saying.  Say it like that.  How do you make a joke about it?  Right.  They were kind of, obviously she was just joking.  No, go that way.  I'm not gay.  Oh, my God, no.  America.  Is America reading my mind all of a sudden?  Hey, Murphy looks good.  I wouldn't know.  I didn't acknowledge him.  I was looking at the chick.  Looks good.  Watch.  Jimmy, that's exactly what was going on.  Yeah.  Exactly like that.  So, you know, it just looked like he was trying a little too hard as I was watching the red carpet crap. 
[00:36:00]  Abel from Harlem says it all.  Reba is about as funny as the video of Saddam's half-brother getting decapitated.  I want to see that.  Thank you, Todd.  We're done with you.  How come we got the boring Saddam video with the guy with the cell phone.  Boring.  Twitchy.  You've seen on YouTube the video of Saddam in the body bag, right?  Yeah.  With the stuff kind of, you know, coming out of his neck like roadkill.  Yeah, well. 
[00:36:30]  I didn't see that.  But it's not like, you know, the hanging video itself.  Jimmy's screen's on on.  Doesn't compare with his half-brother's head popping off like a champagne cork from what I hear.  Well, now that.  Oh, they hung him and gave him a little too much rope.  And they were hanging him and the other guy that was also found guilty side by side.  They both go through the trap door.  One guy hangs, his neck breaks.  And Saddam's half-brother, they didn't do the weight-to-rope ratio properly enough. 
[00:37:00]  And his head ripped right off his body.  They said his body hit the ground.  And it was just a headless body with a big pool of blood where the head should be.  And his head landed in the bag still that was over his head 15 feet away.  Wow.  Are you kidding?  It just popped right off.  And then bounced across the room?  Yeah.  When you yank a head off like that, it's going to go flying.  Did it have cartoon blood where the blood was just kind of spurred from where the head used to be?  And his hands were moving back and forth. 
[00:37:30]  Ah.  No, I think he just laid there bleeding.  That was pretty much it.  You got to admit that's probably a pretty quick death when your head pops off.  Yeah.  You get ripped.  Not even cut.  It was ripped from his body.  Oh.  The guy who tied the rope tries to overcompensate for a screw-up by singing Auld Lang Syne.  Come on, everybody.  A little single arm.  Come on.  99 bottles of beer on the wall.  It happens. 
[00:38:00]  This isn't an exact science.  Let's go to Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys saw the latest Paula Abdul video on YouTube.  The latest Paula Abdul video?  Yeah, she was drunk in that interview.  Yes, very, very drunk.  We're a little distracted because we found the Saddam Hussein YouTube video of him in a body bag.  Oh, that's where the noose kind of cut into his jawbone a little bit.  But, boy, how could he turn his head like that to the side? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  It looked like he's sleeping on a posturepedic mattress.  His head was perfectly, completely sideways looking over his shoulder.  Like only he could hear someone going, psst, psst, psst.  Watch, psst.  Ryan.  Savage, man.  The Paula Abdul interview?  Yeah, we got that.  Okay.  I just wanted to see if you guys got it because it's probably the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  You really think it's that good, huh? 
[00:39:00]  It's pretty funny, yes.  All right.  Yeah, Paula Abdul sounding drunk on Fox 13 Seattle.  This is on YouTube.  Of course, American Idol starts up again tonight.  She'll dry out for the first few episodes.  You really think she's got a problem?  They're saying that she was really tired.  She was doing a million interviews.  Stop with the tired exhaustion.  Jet lag.  Jet lag.  They pull every excuse out.  When everyone I've ever known in my life that has been drunk, I've looked at and known they're drunk or on drugs or something. 
[00:39:30]  It's never, you know, I look at my buddies after a night of drinking and one of them goes, holy jeez am I jet lagged.  Wow.  I think I'm suffering from exhaustion.  No, you're not.  I just saw you drink five pitchers of beer.  You're drunk.  No one ever fesses up to it.  They got their people running block for them.  You know, these people, they party.  And Paul Abdul, apparently, from what I've read, had some kind of issues with pills at one point in her life. 
[00:40:00]  And it seems to me maybe she dries out before the show, does a few episodes, and then slowly turns back in.  You are an inspiration to this young people in this country.  I just think you're wonderful.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  You're wonderful.  Your voice is singing like an angel.  And then everybody else is like, what the hell is she talking about? 
[00:40:30]  What is wrong?  What's wrong with Paula?  Well, we can play the audio when we get back, and then we can decide, I guess.  That's a quickie.  I think they like it because it makes her interesting.  Because Simon's the only interesting one out of the three, and all of a sudden, all right, he's the black guy's talking, the chick's talking, get to the funny guy.  At least something about her now, you're like, all right, let's just watch it.  You never know.  You really never know on any given night if she's going to be, or at least look like, she's under the influence of something.  And you could tell her eyes get like half-masked, and she kind of slurs the words around a little bit and gets very chatty with everybody and what she's saying. 
[00:41:00]  And then some nights, she's, you know, barely says two words, her eyes are all big, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed.  Right.  Well, we'll play the audio after the break really fast because the Death Watch is on.  Fidel Castro, he's not looking too good.  Oh, he looked bad.  And they're showing like a montage of the young, tough, scary.  A what?  You got to say it.  I said it already. 
[00:41:30]  Where were you?  He's telling me I got to say it again because he missed his cue.  Am I wrong?  Am I wrong?  The guy missed his cue.  So he's looking at me like you got to say it again so I can do my part.  That should be a reflex with you.  Yeah.  You rock.  I didn't want to interrupt.  No, you just do it.  You have two jobs on this show to go, mention, and to hit a few buttons.  That's your gig.  See, that's easy.  That's all you have to do on a daily basis is push buttons and go, monkey. 
[00:42:00]  So if someone says montage, montage.  Oh, God.  I want to start like slowly getting mad at him for doing it now.  Like, but slowly phase it in so he's very confused as to what to do.  Can we work the word montage into the show about 100 times today?  Montage.  So every time we say montage, we want E-Rock to say montage because that's his gig.  That and pushing buttons.  Then you'll be doing it like about something really serious where you don't want it and 
[00:42:30]  the dummy will just chime in and you'll throw your hot coffee on him.  Cup and all.  God, on TV they're showing a montage of missing children.  I don't think that was very appropriate.  Yeah, E-Rock, what the hell?  You got to know when to use the montage thing.  Anyway, they were showing.  Yeah, exactly.  They were showing a montage.  I missed that one too.  Of Fidel Castro on TV, the young, tough, scary Fidel Castro. 
[00:43:00]  Always in his uniform.  And like the observation you made today, now he's in an old person's track suit.  He's in the track suit like the old folks wear where they got the walker with the tennis  balls on the front of them.  And he's trying to look like he's in shape, so he's doing some kind of jogging move with  his hands, but his feet are just barely shuffling on the floor and he's got to weigh 90 pounds.  When he was really sick, remember when they said he was on death's door a few months ago?  He was the picture of health compared to what he is now. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  He's lost even more weight.  He's got a little mohawk thing going because his hair is like falling out.  His beard just, ugh.  Just mangy.  I don't know what happened there.  It's really, really not looking good for him.  His beard looks like your 18-year-old dog.  Just a little mangy and unkempt.  Yeah.  But we bring up Fidel Castro because Jimmy's got a story, someone he knows.  This is one of the most amazing things ever.  Oh, it's tragic. 
[00:44:00]  It's too much pressure now.  Now it's amazing.  No, well.  A barrel through him.  He flew to Cuba without a plane.  No, we know this guy that gets to go to Cuba and he had food.  Lunch or dinner with Fidel Castro a few times?  My manager went to Cuba a few times and he knows people that know Fidel and he took a  bunch of people to dinner and he actually got to introduce them all to Fidel.  Pretty impressive.  Very impressive, yeah.  My manager's a weird guy.  He goes to Africa by himself.  He's a creepy arms dealer. 
[00:44:30]  I know that.  And he actually, Fidel gave him.  No, we got to get into the Johnson stories one day.  Yeah.  He shows us pictures where he's in like Nigeria or West Africa.  It's one of the scary parts of Africa.  I don't know.  Does he hunt?  Huh?  No.  No, he doesn't go.  He doesn't big game hunt.  He just goes to Africa.  That's like people that go to Thailand or Cambodia.  You know they're going there to have sex with youngsters.  That's like that area of the world.  If you're going to Africa and you have no, is he a white guy? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  If you're a white guy and you're going to Africa, you're selling guns to various factions.  So they got pictures of him.  Exactly.  Pictures of him on the side of the road as they're bringing the, you know, a parade of the new  King in the background.  Yeah.  Kind of like if you've seen Last King of Scotland, you know, it's the area is not stable whatsoever.  And there he is on vacation as they're bringing the new West African and what have you leader  through.  Oh, he's in it.  And everyone around him has guns. 
[00:45:30]  It's, you know, that type of scene.  And then he went to Timbuktu and just goes to really a place.  Yes.  Yes.  He goes to all these strange places and it's like, you're nuts.  He's zealic.  My manager is zealic.  Wow.  He just shows up in these odd places and nothing happens to him.  That's, that's cool.  He had a, he had a meeting with Fidel Castro.  They had a dinner and Fidel did something which he really didn't do anymore.  He signed a box of cigars.  It was sodomy.  Rarely do this anymore, but like you for old times sake. 
[00:46:00]  But he, he gave Jonathan a box of cigars, Cuban cigars, and he signed the box or the,  probably the, probably the box, right?  Oh, he signed the box, yeah.  A signed box of Cuban cigars by Fidel Castro, especially after he died.  Completely priceless.  I was going to say, one of the most amazing things you could collect as, as a collector.  I can't think of other things you could actually get.  And, um, he was storing them in my other manager, David's, uh, uh, cigar humidor. 
[00:46:30]  Humidor.  In his office in Los Angeles.  Yeah.  David on the road would have his assistant send him some cigars.  And he'd say, I need some cigars for a meeting tonight.  Could you send me some?  And his assistant would run in, go to the humidor.  Not touch the Jonathan box most times.  Oh, no.  But one time she.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Opened the box.  End, end.  Does he still have the signed box at least?  See, that would be a good thing, but she didn't know it was a signed Castro box.  So after she sent the cigars out, she threw the box away.  Oh, my God.  Threw the box away. 
[00:47:00]  Can you imagine?  She threw a signed Castro box of cigars.  That's.  Eh, you get another one.  There's collectors out there crying right now.  It's gotta be easy.  Well, Jimmy's, uh, you know, a collector of all those, you know, that type of stuff.  Would that just drive you nuts?  My manager told me at the, uh, at Comic Relief, and I could see it affects him.  I can't even tease him about it.  You never get over something like that.  No, he just blinks harder.  It just, it affects him badly.  Like, there's something that's kind of life-changing for him.  So, uh, where was her body placed?  He can't even mention it to her.  You gotta just put her in a 55-gallon drum and throw it into the ocean. 
[00:47:30]  I, uh, I collected baseball cards growing up, and, uh, I had a Don Larson card of the  year.  He pitched, uh, pitched the perfect game in the World Series, so this card was worth  a lot of money.  It was, like, from the, whatever, what, the 50s, whatever.  And I brought it to school for, like, kind of show and tell.  And it was one of these cards that I just, I would not depart.  I would just keep it at home in a box in plastic.  It was one of those things.  And I brought it in to show everyone to kind of brag, like, look what I got. 
[00:48:00]  Very proud.  Show and tell.  And there was just, just this, like, greaser, just this kid that had long hair before anyone  else had long hair.  And he was wearing the leather jacket.  As he's sitting next to me, he goes, oh, let me see that card.  I'm, I'm stupid, like...  Uh-oh, this is where it came from.  I'm stupid Greg Hughes thinking, okay, I'm gonna share.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna show him the card.  Maybe we can become friends.  This is where your bit came from.  What?  You do this to everybody.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  We're getting into something today. 
[00:48:30]  What did he do?  He, uh...  Wow, you're getting into something today.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you just made a breakthrough.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, my God.  I know what's gonna happen here.  I think you're making a breakthrough, and I'm not even kidding.  Holy crap.  That was very important to you.  He pulls it out.  This card was priceless.  Don Larson, you know, the year he pitched the perfect game, pulls it out of the plastic, 
[00:49:00]  and before I could even blink, takes a pen and goes...  Scribbles all over his face, making the card useless.  Useless.  Worthless.  I proceeded to cry.  Oh, no.  Oh, how embarrassing.  I proceeded to cry.  And then destroy everything that anybody feels is of any value to them.  Let me see that.  Dude, I'm sweating.  I think you made a breakthrough. 
[00:49:30]  I'm not even kidding.  I'm sitting here...  That is something.  ...eating up.  It's just sounding...  As you're telling it, I'm like, I've seen this.  Wait a minute.  I know this sounds familiar.  Oh, yeah.  I watch Opie do it.  Holy crap.  I'm heating up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like a little kid again right now.  You're red, dude.  You're right back there again.  Oh, wow.  With his little baseball card and the little greasy-haired kid.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  Maybe you should deal with that. 
[00:50:00]  You should get a Don Larson card for yourself.  Yeah.  Treat yourself to a Don Larson card that same year.  I think everything would be right with the world if I just got the Don Larson card from  the year he pitched the perfect game.  A listener will send one in.  They're good with stuff like that, sending valuable things.  I can't tell you how many pieces of Nazi memorabilia I have sent to me by the listeners.  Everyone's like, on instant feedback, holy ass, the origin of Opie.  Yeah.  There it is.  You know, years go by.  Years go by, and these revelations just pop out. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  I never even thought about it that way, but you might be right.  Because there's something very real when I do that, by the way.  A lot of people go, oh, it's a bit for the radio.  Yeah, whatever.  Joe, believe what you have to.  Joe from Jersey makes a good point.  Yeah, well, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  What's up, O.N.A.?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, while you were crying, did you say, I earned that?  Oh, no.  What are you?  I earned that baseball card.  What?  Oh, no.  I got that. 
[00:51:00]  For the new listeners, go to YouTube and just throw Cake Stomp, Opie and Anthony, into  the search, and we'll catch you up on that little story.  Hand him the card and go, treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  All right.  The Paul Abdul audio is ready to go.  We'll do that after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  O&A, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The Lummy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony Show  at 866-313-FREE.  Hello?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Virus.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:52:00]  We like to call it a virus.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We also like to call it the iShow.  But you have no idea what we're talking about because you had the day off yesterday, so you  didn't hear yesterday's show.  So, go screw.  We're waiting for the cease and desist, but it hasn't shown up yet, so we're still going  with iShow.  iShow.  iOpie, iAnthony, and iNorton.  Right.  Let's say hi to Phillip in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Phillip, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:52:30]  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  All right, man.  I just got my WOW sticker yesterday, and it's posted up on the truck, man.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate that.  Tomorrow's whipping out Wednesday.  Happy hunting.  All right, what do you got?  Tomorrow.  Man, when I was 13 years old, I had an 8-year-old little brother.  My grandfather had given me a Babe Ruth baseball card.  You had a Babe Ruth baseball card in your possession?  When I was 13, man.  How old are you now?  God, I'm dying.  It's kind of rare.  I'm 33 now.  What's the rarest baseball card again?  Honus Wagner.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Gretzky owns a copy with someone. 
[00:53:00]  Of course he does.  It's worth what?  A couple hundred thousand dollars or something like that?  Maybe even more than that.  That's a bit more than that.  Honus Wagner had a card out, and it was being given out in cigarettes, and so he had his yanked  out of the cigarette packs because he didn't want children buying cigarettes to get his  card.  What year was that?  That was 1911.  I want to guess.  How the hell did he know cigarettes were bad?  He was the first guy?  He was the guy.  He was the guy.  Because people are still saying, we didn't know in our time.  How old are you?  All right, so you had a Babe Ruth card at 13. 
[00:53:30]  What happened to it?  Obviously something tragic.  Yeah, my brother decided he wanted to trade it for a fake pair of Oakleys from my neighbor.  Fake pair of Oakleys.  And he still hasn't lived it down.  Oh, wow.  You can beat him senseless.  Well, anyways, guys, I appreciate the phone.  Hold on, dude.  You're wonderful.  Go.  I have a question for you.  I'm 38.  You're 33, so that means in the 70s you kind of had a Babe Ruth card.  Do you think that maybe he gave you kind of a bootleg one, or was it a real one?  No, it came from my grandfather. 
[00:54:00]  It was an original one.  Oh, grandpa.  Do you know where that card is right now?  No, I don't have a clue.  Oh, wow.  Some collector's mouse.  I would love a Babe Ruth baseball card.  Oh, man, wouldn't you?  All my bills would be paid for her.  All right.  Thank you, Phillip.  Bye.  Yeah, well, the Don Larson card back in the day.  Don Larson.  That's where it all comes from.  Opium is Don Larson card with that little bastard who drew on.  I was a very, very innocent kid growing up.  I never did anything wrong. 
[00:54:30]  I always followed curfew.  I was a straight-A student.  And I kind of got bored with school by the time I was a senior.  I knew it was just a bunch of horse crap and decided to, like, you know, go away.  I knew I was going to do radio when I was, like, 12 years old.  Yeah.  So then I realized, school, stupid school, I'm going to start having more fun.  But before then, I really was the perfect kid for mommy and daddy.  Wanted to show off his card.  And I collected baseball cards.  And somehow we got this Don Larson card. 
[00:55:00]  What is it worth now?  Because it's starting to come in.  It's only worth, like, $30.  That's probably a crappy one.  It's got to be Jim Mint.  Maybe it's a crappy one.  Jim Mint 10.  We're looking on eBay, $30.  Jim Mint 10 condition, Don Larson.  We're talking a Jim Mint 10, Don Larson card.  Look at this.  Let me take it out of the package for you and hold it up to get the camera over here.  Don Larson, people. 
[00:55:30]  Jim Mint 10.  Just look at the detail of this card.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  He's putting pen on it.  This mother is putting pen.  On my Don Larson card, Don Larson with a pen mark went from $10,000 Gen Mint 10 to a piece of s**t.  That was a very sad day.  Don Larson. 
[00:56:00]  I rarely took that card out of the plastic.  Keep it in the plastic.  Of course you've got to keep it in the plastic.  Now we're selling it as an autographed Don Larson card.  Not autographed by Don Larson.  Autographed by some scumbag s**t-head little kid that sat next to Opie.  He was the type of kid you just know.  I have no doubt in my mind he's in prison somewhere for something really awful.  Got to be.  Like you just knew at that age even that this kid had no hope. 
[00:56:30]  He raped Don Larson.  With a pen.  We all had those kids in school.  Oops, that didn't make it through.  You get that, Al?  Oh, Al.  Quick, Al, dump out.  Dump out of the pen remarks.  We all had those kids growing up, though.  You looked at them even at an early age, and you just knew eventually they just would be in prison for something horrific.  Trouble.  What's the worst thing someone did that you know about? 
[00:57:00]  I told the story.  From school.  I don't want to say his name anymore, but I told the story.  He signed my yearbook and all that.  There was a crime spree going on on Long Island.  Meh.  Meh.  Opie from the 50s.  Yeah.  A crime spree.  Opie's playmates are on the running board.  They're cars with Tommy guns.  Crime spree.  This is a good story.  Why don't we take turns?  Does everyone have a story?  I got one.  Oh, I got a Lulu.  You got a Lulu. 
[00:57:30]  Jimmy, you got one?  I think so, yeah.  All right.  Kid, you know.  Who wants to make bets on which one is worse?  What do you mean?  A guy you went to school with who had a story.  But you got to kind of.  It's not just a guy.  You had to kind of know him.  It's got to be someone you knew.  Yeah.  That you hung out with in some capacity in school.  Right.  Whether it can't just be someone that was in the school the same year you were.  See, my story, I got proof.  I could bring in my yearbook.  He signed the yearbook.  We used to hang in the lunchroom here and there.  We, I wouldn't say we were like close friends. 
[00:58:00]  But certainly we were friendly with each other on a, on a regular basis during school and hung out at a party here and there.  Maybe if I saw him at a party, we'd hang for a little bit.  Okay.  That type of thing.  It wasn't like we were best friends or anything.  I'm not trying to make it bigger than it is.  Okay.  Well, there was a, there was a crime spree on Long Island and what was going on on Long Island, guys would follow really expensive cars home.  Ah, this old gag.  Right.  All right, so basically what they would do is they would drive the Long Island Expressway and they would see a really nice car. 
[00:58:30]  They would follow that car home knowing it was going up into the North Shore where the really nice houses are and the mansions and stuff.  And it's also pretty desolate because all of a sudden they're pulling into one of these huge houses with a lot of acreage.  Piece of crap car follows me long enough, I won't go home.  Oh, really?  I'll make a few twists and turns just to be safe.  And this has been going on for years.  Every once in a while you'll hear about one of these stories. 
[00:59:00]  So, and then basically they would rob the person in their driveway.  And it would be, for the most part, you know, it sucks for the homeowner.  He gets robbed in his driveway, but there was no real violence involved.  Violence.  So this kid I knew back in the day, you know, fast forward a bunch of years, he's one of these guys following the car's home.  He gets to the driveway and they're about to rob the guy.  And this guy pulls out a gun and blam!  The homeowner pulls out a gun.  Yes.  And pops the kid I used to know in the back of the head. 
[00:59:30]  I've told this story before.  So then he had an accomplice or whatever.  So the driver takes the kid I used to know in the car with him, gets the hell out of that area, ends up, obviously the kid I knew was dying.  He freaking parks the car, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, in the back of the Walt Whitman Mall and left him to die.  And they found this kid I used to know dead in this car with a gunshot wound to the head. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  That ain't bad.  Not bad.  What?  You could beat that?  Not bad.  This is like the Jaws scar thing.  Yeah, well.  I have the Indianapolis story.  So, Jimmy?  Mine is not that good, to be honest.  It's not even that in-depth.  It was just a kid I knew named Kelly.  I don't remember his last name.  I don't remember.  I did know him, though, and I was friendly with him.  He was a year younger than me.  And a couple years after high school, he was robbing somebody with a shotgun in New Jersey. 
[01:00:30]  And he shot at one person, and he killed one of those beloved older gentlemen in the neighborhood.  Like, he was loved by all, never did anything but give children nollipops.  He was like one of those old guys that we love.  And this guy, Kelly, killed him by accident and went to prison for like 30 years.  That's not much of a story.  Just, you know, it was awful.  That's pretty horrible.  Yeah, I'm really downplaying an old man's death because there's no punchline to him.  It wasn't that bad.  The guy was old anyway.  Because we still got to make it good for radio.  Nah, it's no big deal.  He just lost his life.  The shallow dope I am. 
[01:01:00]  Well, it's true, though.  I lived in Huntington in what's called the ELs.  All the street names.  Oh, damn it.  You do have a better story.  With the EL.  Started with the EL.  El Dorado, El Wynn, Elwood.  You know, all these streets with the ELs.  And I had a friend that lived at the corner.  Wait, you're not telling the story about...  Beauty's Hill burning down?  Oh, no.  You're not telling that story?  No, that's even a good one. 
[01:01:30]  But, no, this one surpasses that.  The other story is when I lived behind Fred's Diner in Elwood, Northport.  We moved out of the house we lived in for many years, grew up in.  And, I mean, this is the house I have the memories in of, you know, Christmases as a kid kind of thing.  So, you got the 8mm Christmas videos and all that.  Yeah.  And I lived there.  We lived there.  It was like the longest we'd ever lived in a house.  So, I kind of, like, grew up in that house to the point where I was driving, had a car, you know, from the time you're a kid playing with toys and driving and stuff. 
[01:02:00]  And, really, you know, you grow attached to a house like that, very close, my brother and sister and my mom and everything.  And I had, you know, good times in that house.  I remember making snowmen in the front yard and everything.  And we move out.  The landlord or something raised a rent and we moved somewhere else and sold the house.  A nice family moved in.  A father with his two kids, a boy and a girl, moved in. 
[01:02:30]  And that was that.  So, a few months later, thumbing through the paper, there's a photo of our house.  Aww.  My house is, like, a big photo and a picture of the family that moved in there.  After you.  After us, yes.  Did you ever see this family?  No, no.  Never saw them.  Not even when the transaction was going on where maybe you played with the kids in the yard, like, yeah, we're leaving and you guys are coming in.  There was no real.  No.  Okay.  Nothing like that.  So, there was no thing.  So, it doesn't qualify for this story. 
[01:03:00]  But, apparently, the kids came home from school like they did on any given day.  And dad was at the door when they walked in and greeted his children with two rounds from a 38 to the head of his little kids where they proceeded to die on our nice linoleum floor that we had installed.  Oh, my God.  Before he went into the bedroom that me and my brother shared for many years, hanging up various rock posters at the beginning. 
[01:03:30]  And maybe talking about each other's dreams.  Yeah, dreams and things like that.  What you want to do as an adult.  What we want to do.  Where Joe practiced his guitar.  Yeah.  Yeah, things like that.  And blew his brains out right there in our room.  That's terrific.  Pretty much put a damper on all our fond memories of, I believe it was Two Barry Place in Huntington.  Remember that time you broke that dish where the brain splatter was found? 
[01:04:00]  No, no, no, by where the foot was being positioned.  Just a tragic end to some lovely memories at that house.  But that isn't the story.  That's not the story.  No, this happened a few years maybe after that.  I'd moved around a lot, moved in and out of that same area a couple of times.  So I was friends with kids in kindergarten and then left and came back in sixth grade and was friends with them again. 
[01:04:30]  But they had started changing a little bit and you could tell who was going to be good and who was going to be bad.  In kindergarten, everybody, you know, you're just kindergarten kids.  Oh, my God.  He knew Charlie Manson.  At that age.  Anthony knew Charlie Manson.  No.  This was in New York again, still Huntington.  All right.  So a good friend of mine in kindergarten used to walk around the block and go to his house and his mom would make us, you know, cocoa and sandwiches and we'd play with toys and stuff like that. 
[01:05:00]  Knew him very well.  He was my best friend in kindergarten.  I left, came back.  He had started like by the seventh grade getting into like smoking pot and drinking a little bit and I wasn't into that.  I was a pretty straight-laced kid and hanging out with the wrong crowd.  But I hung out with him occasionally because he was my best friend in kindergarten.  So I kind of hung out with this bad crowd but kind of stayed away a little bit.  So again, I leave.  I go out to California, come back.  And now these guys, I see them in high school. 
[01:05:30]  So I saw them in kindergarten, sixth grade and high school and just watched them deteriorate until like now they're just drug fiends.  So one of these kids, I'll just use first names, Michael, decides to rob my kindergarten friend his mom's house.  He goes in to rob the house.  The mom is home.  So he rapes the mother, strangles her to death and burns the house down to cover his tracks. 
[01:06:00]  And this was a guy that hung out with the kid, with the son.  He was like friends with the kid that hung out.  He killed, raped and killed the mother and burnt the house down.  Because the mother knew who he was.  Because the mother knew.  Yeah, would have identified him.  I guess he expected she wasn't going to be home or something like that.  And he, you know, last I heard was off in prison where I guess he'll be forever. 
[01:06:30]  And you knew this kid pretty well.  Oh, I knew all of them.  Like really well.  They used to run around robbing houses.  Like they were always with stereos trying to sell them and stuff.  But they were known to go to like the car dealerships and break the window and get the keys and go joyride and burn the cars when they're done like that.  And it just ended with this awful rape, murder, arson thing.  I was like, wow.  Glad I stayed away from those guys.  But yeah, none knew him.  All right.  Hung out with him. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  You win.  That was a good one.  You win.  Jesus.  Your story had everything.  It was humor, sex appeal.  I know.  It would make a great Lifetime movie.  Starring Markie Post as the mother.  I was trying to remember her name.  Anyone from an 80s sitcom.  Hey, we're using Google Earth to see where 2 Burr Avenue in Northport is.  Yeah, it's B-A-R-R-E, I think.  B-U-R-R-E. 
[01:07:30]  B-A-R-R-E.  B-A-R-E.  Something like that.  Our bus stop was a bar.  It was an actual bar on the corner.  Of course it was.  It was by Fred Steiner.  All right.  We got to step aside.  I think Bill Burr is stopping in to say hi today.  We got an update on the radio show that killed one of their listeners.  We got to get to the Paul Abdul audio.  My baby is black.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got to hear my baby is black.  Not enough hours in the day today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:08:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, it's the Musical Adventure Hour,  where you'll hear one ONA staff member pick the songs while the rest of the staff picks  them apart.  On this week's Musical Adventure Hour.  Travis.  Oh, is this a promo?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It sounds like it's a promo.  No.  Oh, he's a fucking idiot.  Oh, he's such a fucking idiot.  Also, a new round of When the Mics Are Off, this weekend on XM202. 
[01:08:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God, man.  Tell a friend, will you?  We could use the help.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Bill Barron Studio stopping by.  And Anthony just told a great story.  It's pretty creepy.  I'm sitting here all like, yeah, shit, top this.  And you topped it.  It was pretty creepy.  It involved, you know, someone I used to know going into the house of another guy I used 
[01:09:00]  to know.  And they knew each other.  They were very close friends.  The guy went in, said he was going in to rob the house.  The mother was home.  He raped the mother, strangled her, killed her.  And then burnt the house down to try to cover up what he did.  And we were just talking about, when do you realize, wow, I'm in pretty deep here.  Like, the robbery.  If you just went in, robbed, and she wasn't home, and you were left with the stereo or whatever  you left with.  You're like, yeah, I need some drug money, whatever. 
[01:09:30]  You're in trouble.  Your friend that you knew that robbed is going to kick your ass.  Yeah.  You go to juvie, whatever it is.  You know, you're that.  But when do you reach the point where it's like.  Basically, you're saying your intention wasn't to, you know, probably even rape her and strangle  her and set the, you didn't go in with that.  It probably starts off like, dude, we'll get like 50 bucks.  We'll get a keg.  Yeah.  We'll go down to the beach, you know.  Bottom line, you get suspended.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Whatever.  Whatever happens.  And then you're like standing over the raped, murdered body of your friend going, I'm pot 
[01:10:00]  committed here.  I really.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  I'm pot committed.  I know my hand doesn't look that good, but I already got too much in the pot.  What the hell?  I'm a good bluffer.  I got to hope they fold.  What about the kid outside sitting in the car going, gee, it's really taking a lot of  time.  And all of a sudden, the other dude comes running out like buckling up his pants and there's  smoke.  Quiling out going, I'm going to guess something else happened in there. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  With no stereo?  What happens?  He's got no goods on him.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit the guy.  Leave the lights off.  Leave the lights off.  How sloppy are you with evidence that they find it through a burned house?  I know.  How bad of a criminal are you?  Well, apparently when you go into a house to burn it down or your intent is not to burn  it down and then you spontaneously have to burn a house down.  It's a lot harder than you think, I guess.  You can't just put a match to something, especially when some murdered, raped woman is laying there. 
[01:11:00]  A time is of the essence, I'm sure.  It's not like you have gasoline and I think he just threw a match in something and thought  it was going to, you know, burn up the whole house.  And then you got to act cool in school the next day.  Oh, God.  Hey, do you hear what happened?  I hear?  What are you talking about here?  Oh, yeah.  Tragic.  His friends are all giving him crap at lunchtime.  Look at you, Mike.  It was the last time you got laid.  Ah, well.  Well, it's funny you say that.  You smell like smoke. 
[01:11:30]  Smoke?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I just smoked before I came in.  What, pine?  That's where you got to fix things a little bit.  Like, you got to try to make the scene something so it looks natural.  Like, prop the mother up smiling with a cigar.  It'll look like some kind of odd accident.  Leave the prices right on television.  Something tells me this wasn't of her own doing.  No, but, you know, no matter what you do, they somehow always find the cause. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  No matter how much you burn.  You could start a fire with a piece of paper and a match.  Now, doesn't that just, like, burn up?  Yeah.  You could burn down a skyscraper and some fireman will come walking out with, like, the spiral  from, like, the loose leaf.  Yeah.  Well, it was obviously this piece of paper and this match.  I never got that.  We found some fried semen to get out and we realized that there was some sort of...  We were able to obtain some DNA from this barbecued batch and it matches. 
[01:12:30]  You could tell by the angry look on the...  Can I use the word semen?  No, not really.  I'm sure Al's having fun with that down the hall.  It's all in the context.  Who knows?  But you have a story, Bill, you were saying in the green room?  Everyone's got one of these.  I really should have opened for Anthony's.  I really thought I had the one, but I turned in and I could see in his face that he was  going to top me.  It had all the features.  The second he said he had a Lulu.  Yeah.  A Lulu. 
[01:13:00]  I got a Lulu.  Norton, I got a Lulu.  And he was confident because he passed up.  Go ahead, you tell your little story.  Go ahead.  Tell yours.  I try to give my story a little more oof at that point.  I'm like, oh, boy.  I got to do something here.  Oh, someone ended up dead in your story?  That's cute.  Yeah, that's what you basically said in my story and Jimmy's story.  And then you told your Lulu.  What?  No rape?  An arson?  No arson?  You usually figure if you got a body in your story that... 
[01:13:30]  It's good enough.  Yeah, you can go on last.  It's good enough.  All right.  Well, here's my story.  There was some kid when I was a senior.  There was this kid who was a freshman.  And he invited some kid out into the woods.  And they go out in the woods.  It was snowing out or whatever.  It had snowed.  And he's behind the kid.  He started walking in his tracks without the kid knowing.  And he just took out a bat and just bludgeoned this kid to death.  Oh, all right.  And he goes to school the next day.  And I don't know.  After a couple of days, he had a couple other friends. 
[01:14:00]  Took them out there individually.  Showed them the body.  And said, if you guys say anything, I'm going to kill you.  So these kids were just sitting, I guess, freaking out.  What a frigging lunatic.  The body was just hanging out in the woods rotting?  Yeah.  It was kind of cold, I bet.  It was brutal, man.  And then when they finally end up finding him, you know, as usual.  Was one of those boys Little Billy Burr?  No.  Oh, okay.  No, he wasn't.  No, if it wasn't, I'd be like, I can top your story, buddy.  I know.  That would top it.  I was there. 
[01:14:30]  There was a guy with the bats.  Now that tops it.  Called the authorities.  They ratted me out.  I was 32.  Just putting my life back together, guys.  No, and then they caught him.  He had like a hit list that involved a couple kids that he showed the body and like a teacher.  Wow.  Maybe it was like failing history or something.  Ah, well, then he had a reason.  Yeah.  Is the kid still in jail?  I actually saw something on TV recently where I think he was trying to get out. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know if he did, but they sent him to real jail.  They didn't send him like, because he was young.  He was a freshman, but they were like, just the way he did it, they were like, I don't  like this.  No hope for this guy.  Well, Frank, I predict a swing and a miss.  CSI Miami, we're fixated with the awful acting of David Caruso.  Yeah.  Fixated on it.  I saw one last night, right before I was going to sleep. 
[01:15:30]  I roll over to lay down.  I roll over to go to sleep.  And my girlfriend goes, no, wait.  I'm like, what?  She goes, CSI Miami, the beginning.  So we hit it.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And there's this big gunfight at this pool party thing that's going on.  And someone's shot.  And then they find another body in the pool.  And David Caruso walks over.  And Frank is with him, of course, his partner guy, whatever it is.  And he goes, well, it looks like they got away with some trinkets. 
[01:16:00]  And David Caruso goes, but they won't get away with murder.  And then the beginning music starts.  Is that the music we use?  The scream from, yeah.  The hood.  And then the music and the credits.  And of course, right when he delivers the worst line ever written, every time, in the worst way,  he either puts on or takes off his sunglasses and walks out of the frame.  Exit stage left, even. 
[01:16:30]  He's like, da-da-da-da-da.  Like an old vaudevillian.  You know.  And, you know, a bum came up to me the other day and said, yeah, I'm not a bite in weeks.  What did you do?  I bit him.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Exit stage left.  They love me.  They're screaming.  You know, now we've got to play for Bill.  We can't get enough of this.  I've got to play at least one.  I hope this isn't getting old for people out there.  We just can't get enough of this.  The video.  Da-da-da-da.  Take my wife. 
[01:17:00]  Please.  Da-da-da-da.  Exit stage right, even.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Exit.  You've got to see him walk off.  It is so bad.  It's on YouTube.  It's called David Caruso One-Liners.  There's a whole montage of this on YouTube that people are viewing like crazy.  But we've got just a little taste here of the audio portion. 
[01:17:30]  Prince said she came down to drink mojitas and ketchup sun.  But it looks like something caught her.  That's not a joke.  Yes.  That's been all of our reaction.  It's not a joke.  That's David Caruso acting.  And now you might think, has he always sucked this badly?  It's the hottest show on TV, too.  It's the hottest show on television.  I don't remember on NYPD Blue him being such a crappy actor. 
[01:18:00]  But now, every line is delivered.  And then the glasses go on like that.  I think he can't remember his lines.  He probably has like the last half of his lines.  In the glasses?  Wow.  He's got some vision.  I've got to hold a newspaper ten feet away to read it.  No, you just kind of glance.  Oh, as he's bringing it up.  Yeah.  That's why you're Bill Burr.  Let's get back to the montage.  He's reading his lines. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, that's bad.  He delivers lines like he's doing.  He's doing a Sanka commercial.  That's a Sanka commercial.  I know.  Former athlete, no acting trainer.  Yeah.  Hi.  It's delicious.  We died hours before this accident ever happened.  So our accident is not an accident at all.  That doesn't even mean anything.  It doesn't have to. 
[01:19:00]  Sometimes it at least has some kind of silly rhyme to it or reason.  It doesn't have to.  It's kind of a pun.  That meant nothing.  It sounds like they should go into like a song.  Yeah, they go.  Sometimes an accident isn't an accident.  Ba-dum-bum-bum.  Sometimes an accident isn't an accident.  Ba-dum-bum-bum-ba-dum.  All the other cops start dancing in unison.  Don't try to be safe.  Try to be safe.  Spilled that orange juice. 
[01:19:30]  Guy with the drum.  Well, you spilled your orange juice.  This looks like you're in a bit of a sticky situation.  Bill's covered in orange juice.  Hey, we got to go to Melanie in Cleveland.  Hey, by the way, a lot of people have stories about people they knew growing up and something  horrific happened.  Yeah, we'll get back to that.  Don't go anywhere.  This show is always ongoing, so maybe call tomorrow with those stories because we got  to move on a little bit. 
[01:20:00]  We're on the CSI David Caruso kick.  But just because the bit ends for now, it doesn't mean it's over.  So, you know, call tomorrow when you know the show is just dying a slow death.  You can actually help us out with your dumb stories.  I want Gary from Jersey to call.  All right.  Do you want to go to him first?  Let's just hear him, his story.  All right.  But Melanie, real fast.  And were you just, like, completely taken with Caruso's horrific acting? 
[01:20:30]  I love the glasses, the bad line, the walk off out of the shot.  It's like clockwork.  Every single one.  How is this?  I had no idea.  And it's the number one show.  No idea until someone turned us on to that.  Well, Anthony turned us on to this YouTube video.  We don't know, I guess.  Is that through the whole show that he's like that?  Every show starts like that. 
[01:21:00]  And does he do it during the show as well?  Yeah, that's his character.  It's horrible.  Well, Frank, it looks like I'm a douchebag.  All right, Melanie.  Yeah, a lot of people are checking it out now.  All right, you want to get Gary's story on before we move on.  Gary from Jersey.  I love hearing hatchet.  Yeah.  Gary?  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning.  Just real quick, I'm going to get short.  I went to school with this kid. 
[01:21:30]  And in school, you sort of knew he was a little bit off because he would walk through the halls  and growl and bark at people.  That guy.  That's a sign.  Yeah.  You know, it would be like the teachers would lock the doors and call the office and say,  you know, Dwayne's out again.  But a couple years later, after I graduated, I read in the paper that he took a hatchet to  his father and, like, planted it in his chest. 
[01:22:00]  Some call it a hatchet.  I call it a swing blade.  A swing blade.  Some call it a connoisseur blade.  That would have been a better story if he actually killed him like a dog would kill someone.  You know, like if he just bit him and then went on a fire hydrant.  He growled, barked at the police.  He mauled his dad to death.  Sorry.  When we were kids, the stories would go around about this kid that he would take, you know,  dogs and cats and bury them in his backyard and run them over with a pill. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, that old gag.  That's the first sign right there.  Well, but we always thought that, you know, it was, oh, yeah, that's a story.  But if I remember correctly, in the paper, they alluded to animal cruelty as a child.  Yeah.  I knew a kid when I was growing up in East Islip, this was East Islip.  And we were right by Heckscher State Park is over there.  And we used to go in there and there were frogs.  And there were actually like amphibians, like besides frogs, like newts and lizards and stuff like that. 
[01:23:00]  It was like the prehistoric days when I was a kid.  I'm just thinking, like, you don't see, you don't see, like, you used to be able to drive on Long Island  and there'd be a big snapping turtle in the road.  Right.  You just don't see that crap anymore.  Anthony was a kid that was like flamingos.  Ah, that's where Sunrise Highway is now.  I had my slingshot and I was trying to kill a pelican. 
[01:23:30]  A pelican.  You know, guys, when I was growing up, I used to see woolly mammoths.  Yeah, it was a mammoth walking up.  There was like an assortment of wildlife and ferns.  Ah, the chemicals took care of all that.  Like big ferns and things.  I know.  Took care of all that crap.  And just development and stuff like that.  But there were just frogs everywhere.  And there was a kid.  Oh, there's a theory about the frogs, by the way.  What happened?  They're going back to their planet.  Frogs are aliens too, like cats.  Yeah, because Earth is doomed and the frogs are leaving.  They're the first to leave. 
[01:24:00]  Well, perhaps they could have helped out their little pals back when I was a kid because  a friend I had, or not a friend, an acquaintance that lived on the street, would take these  frogs, collect them up, bring them to our street, Country Village Lane, you could look  that up, and throw the frogs as high up in the air as he could.  He would pop fly like a pop fly, but throw them and watch them just plummet into the street  and hit the street.  And you wonder why the frogs are leaving. 
[01:24:30]  They're highly intelligent, and they don't want some dopey kid playing frog baseball with  them.  It was so cruel.  But he was like a bully kind of kid, so you couldn't tell him.  That really was an underground sport that everybody played with, and it was never on TV.  Frog baseball, I think it was just a natural...  Yeah, Beavis and Butthead brought everyone's attention.  It was always like the kind of twisted kid, though.  I never played that.  I felt bad.  I never hit a frog with a baseball bat.  Does it feel bad when you inadvertently kill an animal or something?  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  I don't think I ever did that.  No?  I mean, I teased the hell out of my dog until it became a psycho, but...  He was alive.  You could tease him until they're psychologically a mess.  Well, that's normal, dude.  Of course.  Everyone does that.  How was your teasing?  Every time he ran over for the peanut butter, you zip your pants back up?  No, I don't know.  We were just...  We didn't know.  We were kind of all left alone, me and my brothers, and I don't know.  It was a really...  There was too many guys in the house, so everyone was just, you know, always beating the crap  out of each other, so just naturally filtered down to the dog. 
[01:25:30]  The dog had to take the crap for everybody.  We started off playing this game called the glove game.  You take a look at...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  A gardening glove.  Sort of started mushing him in the face, and he started biting hard, and then it started  to hurt, at which point we moved on to like a hockey stick.  Just started jabbing him.  Like, if you're going for the puck in the corner, you know, you don't want the face  off, you know?  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So then what ended up happening was at some point he learned how to do that bite where 
[01:26:00]  you shake your head like...  Yeah.  Which we all thought was hilarious.  The famous dog bite.  Those are great.  Yeah.  We all thought it was hilarious until he started biting us like that.  We were young.  We were all like, you know, fourth, fifth grade.  He ended up biting me in the face.  I had to get like stitches.  He grabbed onto my face.  Oh, Jesus.  Because he was eating, and I was messing with him, going, I'm going to get you food.  And he probably just...  Oh, did he show you?  Yeah.  Little West Highland Terrier.  Just two of his, like, canines, like right under my eye. 
[01:26:30]  I almost lost my eye.  Right under my eye.  Aren't they all canines in him?  Yeah.  And then they also had, like, part of it was like inside my mouth.  Oh, he really got a hold on you.  Oh, yeah.  And then shook.  Oh, yeah.  It was one of those deals, like, I was going to the Marigold, and I know I'm deformed.  I felt like...  But it turned out just to be, like, puncture wounds.  I so, like, somehow...  You could have ripped your cheek right off.  Yeah, like, I was all bruised, but it was just really, like...  They were like, you know, one-stitch, two-stitch cuts.  Or if you nailed your eye, like, right now, you'd be sitting with a patch on your eye.  Like it was the 1800s.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Arr.  You're twisted, Bill.  I'm Bill Barr.  Yeah, Barr.  Yeah, but the funny thing is, we didn't get rid of the dog, either.  We just kept...  Why should you?  You guys are the ones...  It wasn't the dog's fault.  Oh, and he bit everybody I knew.  Every one of my friends.  It was like...  The dog was insane.  Like, if you walked into the house and you weren't a member of the family, without question,  without thinking, the second you came in, he just charged you, grabbed your leg. 
[01:27:30]  You know what I cannot friggin' stand about people that own dogs like that?  Is the fact that when you go over their house and they're like, oh, no, he's okay.  Just don't show fear and put your hand out in a certain...  Like, there's this protocol you have to go through so you don't get mauled by the dog.  And as soon as they say, don't show fear, the first thing you're showing is fear.  You're scared crap.  Yeah, because you're like, what is this dog going to do to me?  And it's your friend's dog, so you don't have the ability to fight back.  Like, if I get bit by the dog, I would punch it in the face, like, as hard as I could. 
[01:28:00]  But then they'd be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's how he shows affection.  What's wrong with you?  You know, so I'm warning everybody with a dog that if I'm ever over your house and your  dog bites me, I will punch it in the face and then probably punch you and your wife  and then rape her and burn the house down.  Let's finish the David Caruso montage for Bill Burr and the other people out there that  haven't heard it yet.  You mean IRS?  So that makes this a seizure kit and Mr. Whitley a liar. 
[01:28:30]  Murder multiplied by 15 years.  So we have a victim that started the weekend, big man on campus, and ended it dead on arrival.  The victim of the blast.  Or the cause of it.  And the glasses are coming on and off.  On the contrary, there's a chance this girl is alive and we are going to find her. 
[01:29:00]  What kind of acting is that?  Bill might be onto something.  With that pause, he just forgot his line.  Either that.  Just forgot his line.  Either that or that's the 50th take and he's trying to figure out how to make that line,  that awful writing good.  Yeah.  Right as he delivers it, he's just walking off to choke somebody.  Choke the writing staff.  There you go.  I like that story that guy had about a hatchet. 
[01:29:30]  What exactly is the use of a hatchet other than a murder?  I've never heard it.  These days, in this day and age, it's a short-handle axe.  Yeah, back in the Pilgrim days.  It's like an axe version.  I'm sure it was used for something.  It's an axe version of a pistol, is what it is.  Like, where an axe is a rifle, the hatchet would be the pistol.  So you could carry it, conceal it.  The sawed-off axe.  And just hack into someone's chest or head or back.  Just in case someday you've got to murder somebody. 
[01:30:00]  You're right.  I mean, if you work at the hatchet factory, you've got to be thinking like 60% of the hatchets you're making.  Are going to be used in a murder.  End up in the back of somebody's head.  What is this used for?  Splitting wood for the wood-burning Franklin stove?  Or just thrusting into someone's spine?  Occasionally, you'll get some guy who's like a Revolutionary War reenactor.  Yeah.  He needs, look, I need a hatchet to complete the look.  But he dulls down the blade, you know.  Yeah.  You don't want to hurt anybody.  You don't want to hurt anybody when you're running around with other men in a field on Sunday. 
[01:30:30]  Mustets.  Doing two damage, two damage.  Muskets.  Muskets and crap.  Ugh.  Reenactments.  Hatch.  Hatch.  A hatchet.  Yeah.  It's not like Lizzie Borden used a hatchet and killed her parents.  Made the hatchet like synonymous with murder.  No.  Lizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks.  When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41.  That's right.  I remember that little cute little rhyme that they used to tell us as kids.  There was no hatchet is what Jimmy's getting at, Anthony.  There was an axe.  There was an axe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was a hatchet.  No, Lizzie Borden took a hatchet, gave her mother 40 what's? 
[01:31:00]  Watchets.  Yeah.  I think they changed it because it rhymed.  That's a Caruso line.  I think people are getting sick of the Caruso bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And your doctor's handwriting could be a prescription for death.  What their penmanship has to do with your health.  Gee.  All right.  That's a news tease.  That's a terrorizing news tease. 
[01:31:30]  But I guess you could figure it out.  Well, have you ever taken the script to the pharmacy and they'll actually go,  well, I think, you know, I think you need some, I'm not really sure, but it's either Vicodin  or Cyanide.  I'll just pick one.  Take them.  If you feel better, just keep taking it.  If I talked, you wrote aspirin.  He thought he wrote arsenic.  Yeah.  Well, I think this is arsenic.  You're supposed to take it.  You ever have a pharmacist that's not really sure, so they start asking you for the symptoms 
[01:32:00]  you have so they can figure it out on the spot?  Oh, yeah.  I'm not talking to a pharmacist.  Pharmacist gives me whatever prescription it is.  I sign and leave.  Not a word is exchanged.  You know how to work the little thing.  So I like when they reach over like they're helping you.  Beep, beep.  Pushing the thing.  It's like, no, it says next.  It says sign here.  And then it says enter.  I don't need you reaching over helping me.  I don't like how they wear like the white lab coats like they actually went to medical  school.  Exactly. 
[01:32:30]  I could be doing brain surgery, but I decided to work at the back of it.  CVS.  Yeah.  I decided to get the skilled job of taking pills from this bottle, putting them in this  bottle, and then giving them to you and hoping I don't screw something up in between.  You ever sit there and go, why is that taking an hour?  Taking forever.  You just nailed it.  You just simplified their job.  It's take the pills from the really big jar and put it in my tiny little pill bub.  And they ain't moving.  They ain't moving.  Why does that take an hour? 
[01:33:00]  Why does that take an hour?  You're counting.  There's 38 old ladies in front of you.  You got the pills.  It's 100 pills in one of these.  10 of them got to go in here.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Cap on.  Label on.  Done.  Time.  What is it?  You're done.  It's prescription rodeo.  But it takes forever.  And yeah, I will say it's not always their fault.  There's always an old person that goes, prescription for Johnson.  I got hematose.  I got hematose. 
[01:33:30]  And they never have it.  And it's like, I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson.  Your insurance wasn't covering this brand.  So they gave a generic brand.  What is that?  I've got to call my doctor.  Give me the phone.  And they're on the phone.  And you're waiting.  And you just want to kill this woman with a walker.  And you just want your herpy medicine.  With her four-pronged cane.  Dude, that's the best.  You got to get those guys, when you're saying time, you got to get those black dudes who  play chess down in Washington Square Park.  Oh, yeah.  You know how they play at 90 miles an hour? 
[01:34:00]  With a clock.  Yeah, they're the ones who should do the prescription.  Yeah, time.  Just put the pills in the bottle, slap the label on, and hand it to me.  And your doctor's handwriting could be a prescription for death.  What their penmanship has to do with your health.  How about this?  If he signs it, Kevorkian.  All right.  Well, do we need to know how that ends?  We all know doctors have bad penmanship.  Stan's going to beat you with a hockey stick. 
[01:34:30]  Why?  What happened?  Looks like Bill beat his dog.  Why?  What happened?  I didn't.  It was, you know.  I know.  It was a two-minute minor.  It was like a little taunt.  It was a two-minute minor.  Was that a two-minute minor?  Yeah.  It wasn't a misconduct.  Bill, are we promoting anything today?  Yeah, I'm at the D.C. Improv.  D.C., obviously.  And this week and next week, I'm at the Punchline in Atlanta.  Well, say hi to D.C.  We're on WJFK.  Yes, we are.  Hello, District of Columbia.  All right, very good.  Fine district it is.  Yes, it is.  And hopefully, by the end of the show, we'll get into this. 
[01:35:00]  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you for the shock of...  My baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never before told on the screen.  Hopefully, after the break.  I've got to hear the rest of that. 
[01:35:30]  Hopefully, after the break.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, it's the Voss and Bonnie Show.  Three hours of America's funniest comedian and her husband, Rich Voss.  Saturday night from 9 p.m. to midnight on XM 202, The Virus. 
[01:36:00]  3, 2, 1, O.P. and Anthony XM 202.  Very busy morning on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yesterday, when we were doing our show that no one heard because everyone had the day off.  Except for the XMers.  The XMers heard the show yesterday.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  I see where this is going.  Monsters!  Monsters!  Maybe Bill doesn't know about this.  Jimmy does, of course.  We do, of course.  A radio show killed a listener.  Come on.  It was hilarious!  Monsters!  Monsters!  Hey, this is pretty cool.  Radio show.  Basically, they did this contest.  Hold your Wii for a Wii. 
[01:37:00]  Hold your Wii for a Wii.  You know, the Wii WII, the gaming system.  Oh.  So, hold your Wii for a Wii.  They made their contestants drink a bunch of water without allowing them a break.  Uh, and then, uh, whoever could hold it the longest would win the Wii gaming system.  And, um, the woman that came in second went home.  Uh, she was supposed to go to work, I guess, and called in sick and said she was, uh, uh, had a bad headache, a migraine. 
[01:37:30]  And she was crying and decided to go to bed.  Uh, and that's where they found her.  Dead in the bed.  Water.  You are horrible.  Water intoxication.  Water intoxication, yeah.  Yeah.  Which is very rare, by the way.  I saw a kid, uh, a frat, frat kid.  It's always frat kids, yeah.  They make them drink a lot of water because they're stupid and don't realize.  Yeah, if they just let them do alcohol.  It's just water, yeah.  Passed out.  You puke, you pass out.  How do the waterhead kids from high school survive, then? 
[01:38:00]  Uh, it was in their head.  It's okay if it's in your head?  It's actually waterheads.  They don't have water in their heads.  They're called waterheads.  I've heard you call them waterheads.  The medical term is waterheads.  Yeah, whenever they had agreed with you, you could hear it sloshing around.  I've heard waterheads.  It's like you're moving a fish tank up the steps.  What's the matter?  My son's laughing.  I've heard of water on the brain. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  But, uh, you don't walk around with that.  Well, we were talking about this show yesterday, the morning rave out there in Sacramento.  And they are so fired.  We said that yesterday, that they're not just fired, they're so fired.  Completely fired.  Completely fired, no doubt in our minds.  I was wrong, by the way.  I didn't think, I'm like, no, they won't.  And you were completely right.  What year are you living in?  You can't kill a listener.  Yeah.  You just can't.  It's really, out of all the rules in the book, uh, language, fines, um, personal things, 
[01:39:00]  even, some type of, you know, uh, lifestyle, your own lifestyle issues.  Just play it out.  You kill a listener, they, they let you slide, they don't fire you, and you're back on the  show Monday going, so let's do Battle of the Sexes.  And Tuesday, we'll do our Looney Tunes Tuesday bit.  How do you go back in, especially this show, where it's, uh, it's described as topics of,  uh, discussion on the show, uh, have ranged from ghost sightings to celebrity gossip.  The show has a Confession Wednesday call-in segment and airs song parodies. 
[01:39:30]  Airs song parodies.  Oh, and kills, uh, listeners.  Oh, and every once in a while, we'll kill one of you.  I just realized.  Who will we kill next?  I just realized.  It's your morning zoo.  I just realized how safe the show is, because all your bits, the bit is watching whatever  they were ingested somehow coming back out.  Puking is a big part of saving the lives of our listeners. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Right.  You think it's just entertainment, and we laugh hysterical whenever people are doing it.  We're saving lives, people.  That's right.  Worders.  Mm-hmm.  Well, uh.  Did we talk about all this stuff here?  All this highlighted crap?  Uh, the morning rave, blah, blah, blah, taken off the air indefinitely, uh, according to  executives at the end, for a, uh, as they go through this internal investigation.  Ah, we've been through two of those before. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  We've been through two internal investigations.  Um, they both end in the firing of you.  What the internal investigation is for?  They're trying to find out who else to fire.  They try to figure out who else is involved.  God, we're experts.  So they can fire them, too.  It has nothing.  They will tell you during this that this is to, you know, try to get the information out  so we can get you back on the air.  But that's not what it is.  You're already fired.  They know it.  You should know it.  But you don't.  You're gone.  You're holding out hope.  You're dead man walking. 
[01:41:00]  You're holding out hope that maybe you'll skate.  But what they want are names.  They want to know if the PD knew about it.  They want to know marketing.  Who in sales knew about this.  All that so they could just wipe everybody out.  The show's DJs will not be heard until the investigation is complete.  Jennifer Strange, 28, drank nearly two gallons of water over three hours. 
[01:41:30]  That, according to a contestant who drank one fewer bottle of water.  Okay.  That one bottle put her over the edge, I guess.  What exactly, when you die of water and toxication, what is going on there?  Well, your brain cells happens in your brain.  They're surrounded by a membrane with various chemicals in there.  Why are you saying this to me like I'm five?  Because it's like Mr. Wizard.  Oh, okay.  You always talk like this. 
[01:42:00]  You're surrounded by a membrane.  Membrane.  And I'm supposed to jump in with them and be like, membrane?  And the liquid.  I colored one of those.  How do you spell membrane?  It's a very, very sensitive mixture that keeps us going with the liquid.  There's got to be the right amount of sodium and potassium and electrolytes and all this  little crap that's around these cells keeps the cell alive and keeps it the right size.  When you drink too much water, all that other stuff gets diluted.  The cell starts absorbing the water and gets swollen. 
[01:42:30]  And when you swell up one cell, that's no big deal.  Swell up a whole brain full.  Oh, your brain's in there just packed inside your skull.  It can't go anywhere but out your ears.  At that point, people are getting fired.  Yeah.  So, right then.  Frats are closing.  It's over, Johnny.  Can they do anything?  Like, if you know, all right, I got, this is the water sickness thing.  Can they go in there with a needle and at least drain your head or do something? 
[01:43:00]  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah.  They can relieve the pressure.  I would think.  Maybe not with the water.  I don't know.  I don't know on a cellular level.  Well, when you're bleeding.  If they could do that.  Internally and the blood starts filling up in your skull, you could.  Yeah, but I don't know.  You can relieve that, but I don't know with water.  It's not like water is surrounding your head.  I got a mic in front of me, Bill.  I'm an expert.  We have to go back to Opie there for a second.  Just completely making up.  He started looking around the room halfway through the center. 
[01:43:30]  And he goes, oh, yeah, they can drain your brain because, and I started laughing.  Then he immediately goes, yeah, because people have had pressure in their brain.  He turns it into like some sort of like blood clot thing.  Like it's water just sloshing in your head.  He was just talking about brain.  Dude, I realized when I started that sentence that I was like, I have no F in it.  It's a cellular level.  But people expect me to be an expert because I got a microphone in front of me.  They do have water on the brain.  Say something stupid.  There is something called water on the brain.  And they take a tube and drill a hole in your head and put the tube from your head down 
[01:44:00]  your neck into your heart.  And the water drips out of your head and is recirculated through your body.  What is that called again?  It's called the Frankenstein procedure.  Who the hell thinks this crap up?  The dwarfs got to get that procedure.  It's water on the brain.  I know that much.  It's called a shunt.  But I think.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Good one.  Are you kidding?  It's a shunt.  I think.  I watch a little people, big world.  I know all about this stuff.  I thought that was a short woman who was misbehaving. 
[01:44:30]  Anyway.  I think to take care of the water intoxication thing, I don't know.  I'm speculating.  But I think if they replace some of those things that are being diluted out, sodium and electrolytes  and potassium, that might pull you through.  I don't know, though.  I'm just assuming that they would have the capability to do that. 
[01:45:00]  They would have to suck the brain cells out and sort of wring them out.  Wring them out.  One at a time.  Readject them back in.  Put them back.  That's what Opie was trying to ask.  Well, we got a nurse.  We got Nurse Heather.  Nurse?  Is this Nurse Heather from Pal Talk?  Yes.  Nurse Heather.  All right.  Nurse Heather, what's up?  Hi.  They use a hypertonic IV solution.  Oh, and what does that do?  It sucks the water back out of the cells and helps them dehydrate a little bit.  Ah.  How do you do it?  I don't know.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  Way to head.  She's a nurse.  All right.  That's all I got.  What do you have, a friend who does it?  She's a nurse.  She watches the doctors do it.  Exactly.  I don't really do anything.  She doesn't do anything.  She just changes bedpans.  She hands them the stuff.  Scalpel.  She's not like a real nurse.  She's like a porno nurse.  I know, right.  Nurse Heather.  Yeah.  And a little candy striper outfit.  Tee-hee.  Tee-hee.  All I know about is.  She reads nurse for dummies just so she knows a little bit to keep you in the game. 
[01:46:00]  All she knows about is enemas.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, nurse Heather.  What do you do?  I cut myself.  Can I get a stitch or something?  No enema.  So can we get the statement from the station from Sacramento there?  Can you get that back up there, E-Rock?  Please.  So this is John Geary, vice president and general manager of 107.9 The End.  All of you are probably aware of the tragic death of a contestant, Jennifer Strange, following  her participation in a contest on the morning rave last Friday. 
[01:46:30]  First and foremost.  He's heard here, 6 a.m. to 10.  He didn't throw a plug in there.  First and foremost.  Sponsored by.  Is this on a loop on the station when you tune the station in?  First and foremost, our thoughts and sympathies go out to Jennifer's family and loved ones.  I also want to assure you that the circumstances regarding this matter are being examined as  thoroughly as possible.  We are doing everything we can to deal with this difficult situation in a manner that is  both respectful and responsible. 
[01:47:00]  In the interim, the morning rave is off the air indefinitely.  Thank you.  John Geary, vice president and general manager.  Fired.  So fired.  Fired by Friday.  Wow.  Trying to hose down the studio and get the next Slappy and Wappy show in and make believe  this other show never existed.  That's how it works in radio.  Goodbye.  Were they highly rated?  I mean, were they like a really popular show?  I don't know.  Really?  I really don't know.  That's a good question.  People were on the floor with their teeth chattering and pale in a sickened state. 
[01:47:30]  DJ Trish told a caller, a caller said that one of the contestants sounded like she was  going to die.  I felt like I was going to die, Myers said.  They were not concerned about our health being at risk.  You know what that is right there?  That line, that means I'm going to pile on the lawsuit.  Oh, the lawsuit.  Yeah, because now everybody that was in the contest that didn't die is also going to sue.  I've suffered from blurred vision. 
[01:48:00]  I can't drink water anymore.  Cold in the extremities.  I can't hug my children.  That's right there.  That's worth at least 30 grand.  Yeah.  30 grand a kid.  She was sick.  She looked pale.  Her eyes were super watery, of course.  And everyone was really nauseous.  Why don't you just throw up the water?  Yeah, just stop.  But, I mean, why wouldn't your body just start throwing up the water?  I think it gets absorbed so quickly.  It's too late. 
[01:48:30]  CSI Miami.  Looks like they got in a little over their heads.  That feels a board with the David Caruso bit officially.  Well, Frank, water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.  What?  See, perfect.  It doesn't make any sense.  Of course.  Phil in Atlanta, what's up?  I'm just tired of Anthony being a show-off, know-it-all.  I know.  Dude, we get it.  You stay home and watch The Learning Channel nine hours a day. 
[01:49:00]  I love you, Phil.  I got to agree with you, Phil.  I'm sick of me.  Did you notice how without even taking a breath when Bill asked about the water poisoning thing,  Anthony went, well, the cells in the head.  Phil, I understand I get tired of me a lot of times, too.  That was a perfect phone call, by the way.  But you're out.  He's gone.  He's done.  No, we all see it, but we're too scared to tell you.  What can I do?  Enough.  I have to spread my knowledge. 
[01:49:30]  Stupid intelligence.  Keep it to yourself.  You have to.  And I say when I'm speculating.  The second I asked the question, I did look right at you.  Well, I was never a doctor, but I...  I should have asked Opie just to see that look on his face again.  I take pride in being not know-it-all.  Not know-it-all.  I'm not know-it-all.  Well, Anthony is smart in comparison to us.  It's like, when you have two other dummies you're working with.  It's like my girlfriend did this thing yesterday, and I caught her.  We were walking, and she just didn't know it, but she knew I was dumber than she was. 
[01:50:00]  She's like, what kind of food is in that place?  Is that Malaysian?  And I'm like, I don't know.  She goes, yeah, it is.  And I'm like, you bitch, you just asked me.  If I would have said, no, it's not, you would have went, oh, okay, I thought it was.  But because I'm dumber than her, she all of a sudden...  Called you out.  Yeah.  Made you look stupid.  Yeah.  Like, acknowledge that that's exactly what it was.  Yeah.  She didn't know what she was talking about.  All right.  Hey, this is just a dumb quickie, but I like the writing in this story.  I tried to work on my intelligence by reading a lot of newspapers every morning before the show.  Ah.  And I found this in the Philadelphia Inquirer today. 
[01:50:30]  There's a fine new casino down there in the Philly area.  And the headline is, why you won't get rich from slots.  Oh, the slots.  Because the casino wants to make money?  Yeah.  But the first paragraph is kind of funny just in the writing.  Jury, last name I can't pronounce, that sounds Polish.  Pressed a button and watched the three wheels spin.  The seductive lights of the slot machine reflected in her eyeglasses as she sat in an orange-padded chair.  I'm gonna win. 
[01:51:00]  The first wheel stopped spinning, displaying the image of a purple bar.  Oh, purple bar.  Then the second wheel stopped.  Another purple bar.  Jackpot.  And the third wheel?  Here it comes.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  A blank.  Of course.  But tantalizingly, just one space away, she saw the third bar she needed.  Gee.  And then she says, if that bar had come down here, I would have won something.  She said last week in her first visit to the new slots parlor at Philadelphia Park Casino. 
[01:51:30]  Close, but no cigar.  It's like it ran out of gas.  No.  She has no clue that these dumb slot machines are programmed to make a near-miss so you play long.  That's how it works.  Yeah, they want it to look like you're getting so close to winning.  Oh, if it just would have clicked one more time, I'd have won.  Yeah, it says right here, maybe not.  Sure, it looked as if the third wheel just ran out of gas when it got close to the winning symbol,  but in reality it stopped there because an internal computer told it to,  a result randomly determined when she pressed a button before the wheel started spinning. 
[01:52:00]  They are doing that to make you play longer.  That's where they make, I heard they make most of their money.  Slot machines.  Oh, yeah.  I remember learning that when I never talked to anybody in that business.  Right, Bill.  Slot machines.  I just realized that was just a rumor I heard from other comedians.  But see, we finally admitted on this show, we feel like we're experts because we've got a microphone in front of us.  Dude, I do that walking down the street. 
[01:52:30]  I'll just be talking to somebody and I'm constantly just throwing out crap.  It was just never read it, never proven.  I'm so glad the...  I go with my gut.  The slot machines are tamed down now in the casinos.  They've really tamed it down.  They used to...  You're trying to play cards or something and it's just nothing but slot machine noises.  Turn the volume way down.  You ever see a show on, I think it was the Learning Channel.  Oh, boy.  Here he goes. 
[01:53:00]  No, it was a pretty cool thing.  This is called Make Believe You're As Smart As Anthony.  No, no.  It has nothing to do with it.  Watch.  I'll nod and everything.  It has nothing to do with that.  It was an entertaining show.  It was guys that beat slot machines.  Guy worked for a slot machine company, figured out how to put a chip in to certain machines  that he would maintain.  He'd go around and change the chip.  And you'd have to go through this complicated code of how many coins you put in and how many 
[01:53:30]  times you pulled the lever before there was a jackpot and which buttons you pushed.  So if you were just somebody, you could play the machine and it's going to pay off like  normal.  But he knew to go in there or his accomplices, put in like two coins, pull it once, put in  one coin, pull it, put in three, pull it.  And then when you put in like four, if you did it in that order, it would pay out.  All right.  Here we go.  Absolutely brilliant, right?  Yeah.  This is the question I got for you.  How do you ever get caught? 
[01:54:00]  He got caught.  How do you get caught if you're that brilliant to come up with something like that?  I believe it always turns into greed.  Greed always gets these guys.  The two guys are arguing like, look, dude.  They noticed these machines were paying out too much.  And instead of moving on to another machine or something, they looked at the cameras,  noticed it was kind of the same guys going over to the same machines that were paying out.  There was another guy, brilliant, that actually.  They walked away with like, you know, 10 pails of quarters. 
[01:54:30]  Huge.  Yeah.  Big buckets full.  There was a guy that counterfeited the coins that went into slot machines, these giant tokens  from casinos, counterfeited them, bought like, sold everything to buy these etching machines  for the right metal.  He went to metallurgy and had one of the coins analyzed and got the right composition.  Went through all this.  Had thousands of these things made up. 
[01:55:00]  Would go with trunk loads to Atlantic City into the casinos and would sit and play a little  bit.  And then he'd just take these buckets and go and have them exchange for cash.  And they would weigh them.  And then he'd get the cash.  Brilliant.  And again, greed wound up getting this guy.  Yeah.  Was that the one that was doing business in the parking lot or something like that?  He had to get caught.  He would pull up and have like boxes full of these coins and take the big buckets they  give you, fill them up, go back inside, play for a little. 
[01:55:30]  And then they kind of noticed again, somebody noticed a problem with the coins.  There were too many coins when they would count the coins after a while.  And he kept going to the same casinos over and over.  If he spread it around a little, it wouldn't matter.  But they're noticing, holy Jesus, there's $100,000 more coins than we started with.  So that's stupidity.  Yeah.  I saw a guy one time on one of those cop shows.  I forget.  It was either those years ago.  So it was either pay phones or parking meters. 
[01:56:00]  He figured out how to pick this lock, which was allegedly unpickable.  And it was greed.  If he just used it to supplement his income, move up from the Camaro Berlinetta up to the  IROC Z.  That's a problem everyone makes.  That's what he did.  No, he goes out.  He gets like some flashy cars.  And he was going all around.  Rather than just doing like, I don't know.  I mean, how many parking meters are there?  Whatever.  You hit 30 of them out of the whole city.  We got a little bit of a problem. 
[01:56:30]  This guy hit like $1,000.  And then he started going from different city to different city.  And I don't know.  He was paying his hotel bills in quarters.  And they ended up catching him.  Just something stupid like that.  Yeah.  Guys, fans telling me, he just got caught using sleeve cams at card tables.  What the hell is a sleeve cam?  Put little cameras, I guess, spy cameras up the sleeve?  Yeah.  And they had, it was somehow being fed to some guy in a van in the parking lot.  And he'd slow down the tape and see what everybody was getting dealt. 
[01:57:00]  So.  Wow.  Wow.  Chiefs are brilliant.  Yeah.  But they, they got undone by greed.  They won like 10 out of 44 hands or something.  Like, which is way better than you should be doing.  Just bring the ratio down.  That moment, all of a sudden there's somebody with a shaved head standing right behind you.  Yeah.  And you're like, okay, guys, abort, abort.  Sir, do you mind coming with me?  You get that casino treatment.  What?  What took them off as he's wearing a wizard robe with a giant hanging sleeve with a camera 
[01:57:30]  strapped with an arm?  1980s camcorder.  With a big video cassette.  He's pointing at the dealer the entire time he's dealing.  Come on, give me a winner.  I love this guy.  I'm loving this guy.  Just won't stop pointing at him.  His sleeve.  Bing, bing.  Battery low.  Battery low.  Even when you're at a blackjack table and you're doing absolutely nothing wrong and  you see those pit bosses coming around just to take a look, don't you start feeling completely 
[01:58:00]  paranoid?  I didn't do anything.  Even though you know you're not doing anything?  I do that when I've made a few just lucky bets where I bet big and hit and then I bet  real small and I lose.  And you do that a few times in a row and it's just pure luck.  And you're sitting there like, oh, it's good to think I'm counting cards.  I've seen those guys.  I was at a crap table one time and this guy just, he just kept hitting or whatever and  all of a sudden right in the middle, two guys, shaved heads come over and they just  take the dice and they put new dice in and everybody's going, oh, come on, come on. 
[01:58:30]  And the very next time the guy throws a dice and they lose.  And it's like, how do I know your dice aren't rigged?  Yeah.  Right.  Let's keep it moving, buddy.  Hey, someone is saying this show is called Masterminds?  It's an actual show?  Yeah.  Oh, I got to start checking that out.  Yeah.  And it's on where again?  Learning channel?  One of those channels, discovery, learning, blah, blah, blah.  Masterminds, did they show a bunch of people who got caught?  Yeah, I know.  Well, almost Masterminds.  Just short of Masterminds.  And I think Tim on line eight, I saw that one too, but I don't remember exactly how he 
[01:59:00]  did it.  One at Kino.  Yeah, Tim, go ahead.  How did that one work?  Tim?  I saw that show on Masterminds.  Well, that guy that rigged the machine, he ended up figuring out how to rig the Poinko.  I think it's called Poinko.  It's like bingo, but it's like a billion numbers.  Yeah, it's like it's Kino.  And well, he figured out how the code worked in that machine and figured out the random  number generation.  He figured this out, that you could, the random number generator that ran this Kino 
[01:59:30]  game, you know, you pick a certain amount of numbers, it pops up.  He figured out what the next set of numbers was going to be based on this program.  So he's upstairs in the hotel room watching it, and he's got an accomplice downstairs  filling out the Kino forms and sending him in.  And bigger than crap, there it is.  He's watching it on the hotel television.  All of his numbers come up, and they won, but they were caught because the guy's ID 
[02:00:00]  was screwed up.  Something was wrong with his accomplice's ID.  Like, it was that stupid.  Some dumb thing.  Could you please come with me up to the room where the guy is sitting with computer equipment  and he's up in the hotel room with, like, computer equipment and ribbon wires going to  the TV.  Yeah, but you're getting off so much easier now that the mob isn't involved, you know? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, I know.  Back in the day, you'd go down in the basement, Joe Pesci'd take out that hammer.  Oh, yeah.  You made me pop out your eye for this.  We've got to step aside for a bit.  Ah, damn.  We've got the Paula Abdul audio, too.  We tease a lot of things.  We've got to do something.  We've got to do something after the break.  One thing we tease, we've got to do.  We've got to do one of these things.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony! 
[02:01:00]  We're back.  Opie's choking.  Wow.  You put too much food in your mouth at one time.  Because we start babbling during the commercial break, and then I realize, oh, my God, I haven't  eaten yet.  So then you start shoving food down your throat.  By the way, my egg white sandwich today, a lot of eggshells.  Oh, get out of here.  A lot of crunching in my egg sandwich today.  Couldn't even eat it if that was the case.  Why?  It's probably a light bulb. 
[02:01:30]  An eggshell?  Yeah, it might as well be.  Oh, eggshells.  What kind of savage is making breakfast?  He gets eggshells in there.  We haven't talked about the Missouri missing boys yet.  We haven't played the Paul Abdul thing yet.  I want to hear that.  The Paul Abdul?  Yeah.  She's maybe back on whatever.  The pills?  I've heard rumor.  Someone's yelling at us on the phone.  Booze.  They went away, but they're like, she has a condition. 
[02:02:00]  That's why.  What's the condition?  I don't know.  They went away.  Because she was really a wreck at the end of one season of American Idol.  Then the beginning of the next one, it seems like they told her to slap her crap together  and sober up.  And then she was fine.  And then slowly you watched her kind of degenerate back into, you are an inspiration to the people.  Your voice is just amazing.  She's actually talking to the hallucination. 
[02:02:30]  There's no one there yet.  Anne had a great point.  We haven't started the auditions yet, drunkard.  Anne had a great point earlier.  Because, you know, Paul's people are claiming that she had jet lag.  She's tired because she's doing a million interviews because Idol starts up again tonight.  And that goes with all of them.  Yeah.  Lindsay Lohan.  It's the same thing.  Oh, she's exhaustion from the heat on the set.  There should be a chart, like the excuse, what drug it is.  Jet lag.  Okay, that's amphetamine.  Jet lag. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Exhaustion from work.  That's Vicodin.  It's been a little hyper lately.  Cocaine.  This is just plain drunk.  The light, the heat from the lights on the set.  She was drunk.  She was dehydrated.  I've never in all the years I've known my friends and stuff, I've been around, I've seen  drunk people, I've seen people on drugs, and not once have I gone, are you exhausted? 
[02:03:30]  You have jet lag, don't you?  I bet you have jet lag.  No, you're drunk.  You're driving drunk and you're driving car into a tree and the cop comes up.  You've been drinking tonight?  Nah, it's got a little jet lag.  Oh, jet lag.  Again, I've been on the set for hours, exhaustion set in.  Doing Shakespeare in the park, man.  Yeah.  I was filming the Gilmore Girls earlier.  Oh.  Too many hours.  All right, here we go.  Here's Paula Abdul.  Yeah, let's hear. 
[02:04:00]  You decide if it's jet lag or some form of pills or alcohol.  Good morning, Paula Abdul, live in New York City.  Good morning, everybody.  She can hear us.  So far, no problem.  A nice, peppy good morning.  I want to stop the table.  Let's play.  When do you think?  People start noticing?  Yeah, exactly.  Tell us, what are you looking forward to this season?  How about a lot of you coming in?  It's a wild party where you are. 
[02:04:30]  Right there.  Yeah.  No, but that could have been, that could have been, she's trying to be funny.  And not be.  Because she quickly got back on track.  But she was trying to be funny and she was incoherent.  I couldn't understand.  A lot of you coming.  What was her answer?  Come on.  By the way.  It's ridiculous.  You can't be wasted and have that many pronouns in a sentence.  What did she say?  I got to hear it again.  Because it didn't make sense, I don't think.  I thought that I'm looking forward to a lot of you being here. 
[02:05:00]  A lot of you coming in.  Coming in.  Because you guys have been so crazy.  Like, this show's like a party.  You know, she was hearing it.  How about a lot of you coming in?  It's a wild party where you are.  Yeah, that's what we hear.  We hear that Simon has actually said that this had some of the worst singers that he's ever heard.  What did you think of the singers in Seattle?  Well, I have to agree with Simon.  Oh, no.  Paula.  Oh.  Hey, you know what? 
[02:05:30]  It is what it is.  And it was brilliant.  It is what it is.  Wow.  She's getting like, whatever high she has is that philosophical one.  She's about ready to tell everybody there that she loves them.  Yeah.  You guys are the best.  I'm going to be an optimist.  I'm going to say a little jet lag.  A little too many interviews.  Jet lag.  Faking the energy because she's done about a hundred of these.  Sounds like a...  They sat her in a studio and then they threw her on all these morning shows across America. 
[02:06:00]  You think?  I'm holding out a little hope.  I'm going with tennis elbow.  Tennis elbow.  Oh, he's causing a slurred speech.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a combination.  Maybe she had jet lag and then dropped her face into a bag of Coke like Starfish.  So technically, it was jet lag.  Right.  Here's the condition.  It's Steve from Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hey, not much.  Yeah, Paula, she's got the RSD according to last season when she was nodding out. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, what's RSD?  It's reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  Now they call it complex regional pain syndrome.  I got it after a car accident and I had to have surgeries in my wrist and ankle.  What is it?  What happens is your nervous system constantly, the nerve endings constantly overfire the pain  signal.  It never stops. 
[02:07:00]  So I've been on Oxy, cotton 40 milligrams a couple times a day plus...  Sounds like a made-up disease to get good drugs.  No kidding.  That sounds like you hurt your wrist and your ankle, like, for life in a car accident.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are you blaming your nerves?  And I don't believe you because...  You're blaming your nerves.  You should be blaming your driving.  I don't believe this guy.  He's been on the air for exactly a minute and not one time did he go, ah!  Yeah.  Ow!  You know the feeling you get when the freaking nerve fires?  Not one time.  Or at least with your attitude, you'd be angry all the time. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm definitely angry all the time.  I carry a weapon, too.  Anthony would love that.  Oh, boy.  Nice.  Steve, I didn't mean no harm.  Didn't mean any harm whatsoever.  There you go, guys.  I'll be stalking you.  But, Anthony, you can appreciate this.  They tracked it back to the Civil War days when the guys were getting shot in the legs.  And they were having, you know, dig around there to get that 40-cal, you know, ball out of the legs and whatnot.  Yeah.  Guys were filling their boots up with water because what RSD does, you feel in the extremity, hot and cold sensation, both at the same time. 
[02:08:00]  That sounds like restless leg syndrome.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Another made-up disease.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  For the hell to restless leg.  You ever see the commercial for that?  Do you have the feeling that your legs just have to move at night?  Especially when you try to sleep?  You might have restless leg syndrome.  What the hell is it?  Do you accidentally boot your wife in the ass during a nap? 
[02:08:30]  Do you just collapse while you're walking?  My legs are suffering from jet lag.  Like that's something you'd ignore.  You know what?  That does happen.  Restless leg syndrome.  And then they show some people kind of like, you know, get all mad because their legs won't stay still.  Just hold your legs still.  Where was this disease back in like 1975?  Isn't it shaky leg syndrome or something like that?  Are they talking about that?  It's called being, it's Dr. Than.  It's called being antsy. 
[02:09:00]  You've got a case of the antsy.  Thank you for your diagnosis, Dr. Than.  All right.  Let's get back to the audio.  Paul Abdul.  Let's see if she sounds a little worse here.  So far, I'm holding out hope.  I'm thinking jet lag, too many interviews.  This show has turned into a flat-out star maker, seven or eight of last season's alums, pulling record deals.  How do you think Idol has changed the face of pop music?  Well, let's put you this way.  When the show started, the record industry said, this show is going to ruin the music industry. 
[02:09:30]  And the record industry was already kind of upside down.  But now, we are legitimate, and we're churning out mega, mega stars.  And it's a show that actually, you see great things happen to these kids.  And I love it.  And I think that it's going to be around for a while.  She should have bailed like nine times in that.  Oh, man, right?  I wanted her to stop.  Like, just stop.  No more. 
[02:10:00]  They said we were going to ruin the record industry.  The record industry?  She has a problem with her S's.  She slurs her S's.  And we're going to be around.  Let me get out on a limb here.  American Idol's popular.  I see high ratings.  She keeps winding down.  And that's why it's a great show.  Because when we do the show, you're like, oh, you were out of it.  Oh, you were done.  There was a chance for a period.  Not a comma.  Because we're making stars, and we're pumping out stars. 
[02:10:30]  Like, last season, we had this good.  Oh, no.  Not last season.  Yeah, and speaking of great things happening to people, an old buddy of yours, William Hung,  he's coming on our show tomorrow morning.  You're kidding.  Yeah, he is.  He'll be here tomorrow.  And he seems like a really nice guy.  When he auditioned for you, did you have any idea that he was going to become such a cult star?  You know what?  I thought that this kid is going to, if anything, prove that he has so much, a tremendous amount of heart. 
[02:11:00]  And he's got drive, and he's a smart kid.  And boy, did we see how smart he actually really is.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, there's something going on.  That's RSD, or is that...  Well, someone is really mad.  RSD is not a joke.  It's Momo.  Faithful listener of the show. 
[02:11:30]  What's up, Momo?  RLS.  You're getting the wrong restless leg.  Yes, Momo?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Restless leg is not a joke.  I've got it.  And I know...  Is it shaking right now?  It's actually worse when you're tired.  Like, I know when I'm getting tired, if my leg starts, I can't stall him.  Where was this disease even back in, like, five years ago?  I had it.  I've had it for a long, long time.  I just never knew what it was.  And then I finally started taking an anti-feasure medicine for another condition, and it stopped 
[02:12:00]  almost.  Yeah, we've invented way too many diseases.  So many.  Well, it's true.  It's a legitimate disease.  Ah, shut up.  Tough it up.  Throw some warm milk on your legs and go to sleep.  All right, guys.  See you later.  All right.  I'm going to strap it, tie it down, and get a good night's sleep.  What?  Am I an idiot?  Doesn't a disease have to be, like, fatal? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, I would think.  You know what I mean?  Your leg shakes.  You got shaky legs.  You know what I mean?  When God was putting you together, somebody distracted you, you forgot a washer.  You crossed a little.  You forgot a washer.  You threw a couple of nuts.  Something a little loose in your transmission.  Insulation rubbed off on a wire.  Yeah.  It could be worse.  He's like a Pinto.  He's like from that line.  Yeah.  From that line.  Ah, just discontinue that model.  People want to play Guess What Pill Paul Abdul is on.  Matt in North Carolina, what's up?  Yeah, she used to sound like me when I'd take Adderall on set for, like, two or three 
[02:13:00]  days.  Yeah.  It just takes a toll on your mind, and you just, like, you can't form sentences.  It's just hard to talk.  Hmm.  I'd like you.  I'd just be, like, strung out on, like, Adderall, you know, just, like, overdose and take it,  like, twice, three times as much as my dosage.  His call has done the same thing to us.  Yeah, wow.  I'm at a loss.  I don't know what to say.  I can't make a sentence.  All right.  Listen, Big Duties Jay from Jersey says it all on the Instagram. 
[02:13:30]  From Jersey?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I didn't want to confuse him with the other one.  There's a Big Duties Jay in Kansas, of course.  This bit is okay.  Just update it.  Hold on.  This bit is okay.  But your baby is black would have been much better.  Well, we had to make a decision there.  We had to make a split-second decision.  And Idol starts tonight.  Your baby's black doesn't start tonight, sir.  You know something?  I've heard a lot of people on message boards and other things say,  you know, I liked the way the show was when you guys were on N.E.W. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  You just got a taste of it.  OPT's something the entire show, and you never heard it.  Remember that?  And you're not going to be able to help yourself.  You're going to have to tune in tomorrow.  That's my brilliance.  There you go.  That's my brilliance.  There's a blast from the past.  I dare you to go, you know what?  Screw those guys.  I'm not listening tomorrow to find out what maybe it's Michael about.  You've got to hear it.  Yeah, I double dare you.  Somewhere in your subconscious, you're going to be like,  I've got to tune that show in again. 
[02:14:30]  Sometimes it went on for a week.  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before  will prepare you for the shock of...  My baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story  never before told on the screen. 
[02:15:00]  That baby didn't sound black.  Crying.  Sorry, I was trying to play a sound effect, and it didn't work.  It didn't work.  Oops.  I wonder why.  I could tease the second clip.  The second clip of My Baby is Black from 1961.  Class watching an educational film.  Social workers talk about civilizing black kids.  All right.  Let's give it a listen.  I'm open-minded. 
[02:15:30]  That's the end of the show music.  Hey, man.  That just starts on its own.  I don't know what to tell you.  Damn.  I was about to play track two.  See, we really tried to get to it.  You're not going to listen tomorrow, right?  I dare you.  Try not to listen tomorrow.  I dare you.  Tell your friends not to listen tomorrow.  And tell them why they shouldn't listen tomorrow.  I dare you.  You know what? 
[02:16:00]  I'm going to listen tomorrow as I'm packing my suitcase  on my way to go to Washington, D.C.  to the improv this weekend.  Really?  Yes.  Are you going to be there?  Yeah, I'm going to be checking out some of the monuments.  Yeah.  Telling some jokes out at the club.  Some jokes.  And BillBurr.com?  Yep.  MySpace.com slash BillBurr.  Norton?  Chicago this weekend.  I get to see Steve Dahl on Friday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're doing Dahl's show?  Yeah, Friday afternoon.  Tell them we said hi.  Nice.  Absolutely.  Checking in.  All right, guys.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, my friend.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hey, we're here.  He's a complete fuck.  Sorry.  Oh. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Way, we're on.  Come on.  Teasing, of course.  I'm still not set to do this walkover today.  We were chit-chatting.  What are you called?  No.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I know.  I was waiting for somebody.  I know.  You come out of that revolving.  How you doing, pal?  He's just putting his arm around me all tenderly.  You're getting that stainless steel all nice and clean?  How you doing?  Good.  All right.  Oh, excuse me, miss.  Hi.  That guy's one of the good guys, by the way.  Yeah, we like him.  He says hi every day to us.  He's a good boy.  He's a good guy.  He's polishing the stainless steel on the building that only goes up 80 floors.  He's polishing the bottom like two feet of it. 
[02:17:30]  What the hell?  You know what I always think when I see a guy like that?  I'm like, what did he want to be when he was growing up?  Not the guy that polishes the stainless steel building.  I want to be an astronaut.  But we like this guy.  Huh?  But we like this guy.  No, we do like this guy.  He was shitting all over his job.  Dude, that guy is polishing, but he's happy as hell doing it.  But you know what else?  He's got to, like, he didn't make the decision to do that.  A boss told him to polish the building.  How you polish a fucking building?  Who did he piss off?  He must have forgot to empty the, uh, what are we looking at? 
[02:18:00]  I can't say it on the air, but I want to make Anthony laugh.  It was the, um, of the line.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys talk for a second.  Hey, Jimmy, how are you?  Talk, cover the noise.  Talk, cover the noise.  I don't know, he's saying something that's secret.  That was cruel.  Cruel, but hysterical.  Sometimes you just got to be a private joke.  I think I figured it out.  Oh, you figured it out?  Yeah, okay.  I was going to tell you, too, but they were telling you, I think I figured it out.  All right, good.  Sorry, sometimes the walkover's private. 
[02:18:30]  I know, I don't even get it, it's so private.  That's the beauty of me.  My jokes are funny off air.  We saw, we saw, um.  Why is, whose mic sucks?  Mine is, uh, but it could just be the, um, headphone thing.  Mine is going, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Yeah, it's going to, shh, shh.  Mine is going to be doing that, too, Jimmy.  That was a great impression.  The closer we get to battle, let's just keep walking.  I don't do voices, I do malfunctions.  Ah, all right. 
[02:19:00]  We got to check these mics.  I think there's some atmospheric disturbance.  So, Jimmy, where are you working in Chicago this weekend?  What's that?  Where are you working in Chicago this weekend?  Zanies.  Zanies.  It's going to be crazy.  It's going to be crazy.  Zanies.  It's cold in New York.  Chicago is going to suck.  It's, uh, 21 degrees, light snow today in Chicago.  Oh, brr.  I'm, I'm the rain man when it comes to that crap.  It's a beautiful day out, huh, guys?  It stinks.  It's going to get colder, too, by the way, here in New York City. 
[02:19:30]  Uh, we started off with a temperature of about 55 degrees.  It's going to be dipping down into 30s tonight.  We're looking for 20s in the suburbs.  Anthony, can you tell us about the weather?  You better get out your earmuffs this weekend.  Lows in the six, six digits.  Six digits.  Lows in the six.  I was going to say 16 degrees, and I had backed myself in.  Lows in the six.  Lows in the six digits.  He's doing fucking weather from Mercury.  Oh, classic.  I stink on the walkover.  It's going to be a chilly 4,200,000. 
[02:20:00]  I only had it in the thousands.  Ah, that only went out to, like, 4 million people, right?  Ah, don't worry about it.  No big deal.  No one's listening.  It's not like it gets replayed four times, either.  Hey, Anthony, you ever want to drive through Manhattan and shoot those old-fashioned water  towers on top of the old buildings there?  Yeah, watch them all leak out or explode.  Live out some sort of Clint Eastwood fantasy?  Ah, that would be nice.  Fun.  Why do they still have those?  Like, it's 2007, and there's wooden water towers like Petticoat Junction. 
[02:20:30]  What the fuck is going on?  Like we're pulling into Clarksville?  Yeah.  It's 2007.  There should be some futuristic thing.  I want to...  Wooden water tanks.  I want to thank the two regulars for doing the walkover today.  Everyone else stayed home because it's a little cold out.  Everyone else, go screw.  You babies.  It's 60 degrees.  We've got 100 people out here that wants to get freezing.  Check out the show.  I didn't like that guy sticking his head out of the DHL van like he was in a Bjork video. 
[02:21:00]  Damn good recall.  All right.  Are we done or no?  Yeah.  I think so.  We have to walk up the steps.  So they should go to break right now.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  We want to congratulate Anthony.  This is a very rare thing that happens on the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, the first show is heard on regular radio and the first half of the show, I should say.  And, you know, they've got to keep it FCC-friendly.  But you here at XM get the uncensored version of the show. 
[02:26:00]  Chapter for the curse words.  But it's kind of fun to take a look at the dump report from time to time, and this is very rare.  One dump, and it was by our pal Anthony, the responsible one on the Opie and Anthony show.  But I called it right when I called it right when I said it, right when I said it, I said, ah, they're going to dump that.  And they might be learning over there.  We were just discussing this just before we turned the mics on.  They allowed semen to go through.  They allowed fried semen to go through.  They didn't dump on semen.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Well, Al didn't because they didn't dump semen.  It's a food reference.  It's delicious.  So, you know, maybe they're listening over there because it doesn't have egg whites or shells in it.  Shit.  Yeah, all right.  Well, one dump today.  Anthony, 7.13 a.m., raped Don Larson with a pen.  Yeah.  I didn't do that.  I was just talking about it.  You can't even talk about it.  Well, it was in two of them.  I said he raped Don Larson, and you said with a pen. 
[02:27:00]  With a pen.  It was in context.  And then, right, I know you could talk about rape.  You just can't say raped with something.  And I said it.  Let's say hi to Chris in Florida.  Al dumped.  Chris, what's up?  Hello.  Hey there, Chris.  You're outside?  Yeah, I was outside.  I was wondering if I'd come up and watch the show.  Considering you're the only listener that showed up for the walk, I don't count those other two guys that are there every day.  What?  Walkie-talkie man was out here.  See, even you know that walkie-talkie man is outside every day. 
[02:27:30]  What is that?  Is it a ham radio?  Are we on a ham radio channel as well?  We're on everything else.  He was playing something off the antennas.  Has anyone asked that guy what that thing is?  Why don't you come upstairs and do what you do best and just watch and listen instead of yapping over us talking?  We're getting into maybe a possible bit here.  Does anyone know what that guy does with that walkie-talkie every day?  Have we asked him?  No.  Yeah, I know.  Dan, you know?  Oh, Dan.  Yeah, he basically picks up the... 
[02:28:00]  Because we send out a wireless signal back and forth from the mics on the street.  So he's picking up the actual signal that the mics send out.  Holy shit.  So that fucking guy doesn't listen on Free FM, doesn't listen on XM.  He catches the show on the walkover through his...  Through a frequency.  Through a frequency on his ham radio.  Not only that, doesn't that mean he can hear it the second we start talking?  Oh, that is...  There's some...  Well, what's the problem?  Oh, Danny Amar's gonna duke it out. 
[02:28:30]  Kick his ass.  Oh, there's like some...  Wow, what happened?  There's probably some kind of issue.  Hands are up.  Brisk walk away.  It's probably not supposed to be said, but I bet there's some kind of a broadcast issue.  Why?  We don't know that guy.  It's like pirate.  It's all good, Mars?  Are you gonna beat anyone up?  That was actually nothing to do with what we were talking about.  That was like a thing between two men that had had like a sexual encounter.  Yeah.  He didn't like the way Danny was looking at us.  What happened?  Oh, secrets. 
[02:29:00]  How could you possibly get in trouble for that?  There it is.  A lot of whispering.  A lot of whispering.  We don't know what you're talking about.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  Billy, your microphone's off.  All right.  I know.  Bill's microphone is off.  Hello, Bill.  Hello.  Oh, there he is.  I was gonna say, damn, I was doing great over there.  I know nothing.  Some type of, yeah, issue.  Danny got a little defensive.  Yeah, but then Danny calmed down.  And now I don't even remember what we were talking about.  Is it this?  I don't know.  They cut out my brain. 
[02:29:30]  C.  C.  Yeah, C.  C-scar in my brain.  C.C.  C.Rider.  C.C.  C.Rider.  Fuck.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Fantastic.  Clit.  Cunt.  I know nothing.  Nice to be in the military.  C.Rider.  C.Rider.  C.Rider.  C.Rider.  Someone is asking, well.  And by the way, Danny didn't calm down.  Danny realized that Mars trains under Poe and would kick his stupid teeth out. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, I know.  Danny just realized, oh, I'm gonna get my fucking ass better.  Yeah, Mars would do that just to impress Poe.  Yeah.  Not because he needed to, to defend himself or anything like that.  Eric in Rochester, what's up?  The home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Eric?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you today?  Good.  Hey, quick question.  And I'm looking at my XM display here, and it says I-O-P and I-Anthony.  You didn't listen to the show yesterday.  Well, excuse me for working.  He told you. 
[02:30:30]  In 1945 vernacular.  Such an old man response.  Good point.  Well, excuse me for living.  Good point, Eric.  Good point.  His whole response, I don't have a comeback for that one.  I bet he shook his fist, too.  Sometimes you gotta realize when you're beat, you got me today.  Gotta give it up.  Most of the time, listeners get freaked out if you give him shit, and they back off.  That dude just yelled at you like you weren't as little there.  He's still there.  Excuse me for working.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Eric, we're taking a page out of Apple.  Apple.  We're doing this until the cease and desist comes in.  Everything with that lowercase i in front of it, iPod, iMacs, now the iPhone coming out.  Everything like that is very popular with people.  It's very big.  A lot of people want them.  A lot of people get them.  So we figured we're gonna be I-O-P, I-Anthony, I-Jim, and it's gonna be the I-O-P and Anthony  show, the iVirus, here on IXM. 
[02:31:30]  And we're getting painted white today, by the way.  Yes.  I know we're white, but you gotta get the real white.  That real nice, yeah.  Actually, that's the old version.  Black white.  There is a problem, though.  My corneas are easily scratched.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Cut it out.  I actually missed that one.  It just is.  Oh, and you won't hear it again.  No, no, no.  I was actually-  I don't care.  I don't care.  Wait, I don't get it.  It would have killed it.  I'll explain it, but I won't do it again.  I will acknowledge that you're explaining it not to get crashed again. 
[02:32:00]  There's a very big problem with the iPods, that the display gets scratched.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Oh, you think I like E-Y-E?  Wow.  No.  I was just some type of display.  Yeah.  It was horrific.  Probably only second to my white shorts line of 1999.  You even remember the year.  You gotta stay away from white jokes.  Hey, good idea. 
[02:32:30]  So it's anything that has to do with-  Black jokes is all you're gonna hear from me.  There you go.  You redeemed yourself.  Yes, Jimmy.  You were reading the paper.  Oh, no.  I was just saying that's why I didn't hear the line, so I was just reading it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I just didn't hear the line.  I was like, I wasn't even trying to-  That's an obscure reference.  You're making a blow today, Jim.  You're wrapped up in a pun.  Yeah.  No, well, the Missouri boys, we think that is just downright creepy.  The guy kidnaps one kid for how many years?  Four years.  Four years?  Four years, and he was allowed to go to friends' houses, play outside, go on camping trips.  On the computer? 
[02:33:00]  He was allowed on the computer.  Yeah, how about help?  And his parents never gave up hope of finding this kid.  Yeah.  And then the creep kidnaps a new one, and then the case was broken wide open.  Yeah, he needed something a little younger.  The second kid was like, hey, why don't we just leave?  It's getting a little older.  Well, you know what?  Maybe he was starting to give him shit.  No, it's like getting a new pair of sneakers.  You know, you love the old sneakers, but they're getting old.  Now, look at the picture of the-  Smell.  You gotta get a new pair.  Look at the picture of the old kid. 
[02:33:30]  See, he's growing little sideburns in like that.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  He's got a hit song out right now.  You need hairless.  Well, yeah, he's getting to that age where you can almost be able to beat up your dad.  Yeah, and you know, if he had a problem, he'd kick the crap out of him.  So I was going with a John Mayer joke, but he didn't allow me to finish.  Oh.  I said, I hit song out because, you know.  And then I was going to bring it on home and say the guy looks like a very young John Mayer.  He really does.  I was thinking, give him the little round glasses and a magic wand, and he would look exactly 
[02:34:00]  like little Harry Potter.  Dude, look at it.  On occasion when he was out with his best friend, Tony, cops picked him up, but they  either dropped the pair off or let them go.  Yeah.  He's in the custody of the police at some point, and they return.  Yeah.  They're out a little too late at night.  The cops see that.  They pick him up and go, what the hell are you boys doing?  Making sure everything's cool.  And the kid is actually going-  Kidnap her, please.  Yeah.  The kid is actually saying, I live over here.  And then the cops dropped him home again.  Apparently. 
[02:34:30]  That's where they always start bringing up, like, being brainwashed and stuff.  But I don't know.  You're a bit of a moron.  It can happen.  Colleen Stan was brainwashed.  She was kidnapped by adults.  They kept her for seven years.  And they actually kept her in a coffin under the bed.  It was the worst story you've ever read.  And they convinced her that they were slave traders and that if she came forward, the police  were involved.  And they brainwashed her for so long.  So, eventually, they started letting- she actually went back to visit her family and  then came back to the kidnapper.  To the coffin?  Yeah.  They really- they convinced her that they were slave traders and her family would be killed. 
[02:35:00]  And she bought it.  It was like an ordeal.  Did they use her for sacks?  Oh, did they?  Oh, yeah.  Boy, did they.  Really dirty.  That's always good.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Massachusetts.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, did you guys hear that the one that was kidnapped for four years, he actually got to  use the internet and would post messages to his family's website that they created so that  he could- you know, they created to look for him.  So, he actually posted messages underneath his real first name and the guy who kidnapped  him, Delvin or something like that, as his last name and said, like, how long are you 
[02:35:30]  going to look for your boy and all this other stuff?  It was pretty freaky.  See, there's something going on where I think there was some problems with this kid and  his family before he got kidnapped or ran off or whatever the hell they're going to call  this.  He probably knew the old guy.  He probably knew the guy.  Yeah, he probably knew him.  There's something else going on here.  And kind of just, you know, didn't want to deal with the family anymore.  What was he, 11?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of a weird age, you know?  You think your parents are assholes and you leave and all of a sudden you got this guy 
[02:36:00]  who's, you know, hooks you up, he gets your bike, sucks your dick, whatever the fuck,  you know, you want.  And maybe the guy was kind of fascinated with him.  Let's just smoke a little pot.  He probably knew the old guy, the old creepy dude from the neighborhood or whatever and  then fucking, he just lived with him.  He didn't kidnap him.  You don't think he kidnapped him?  No.  There's going to be more that comes out with this story.  No, because the kid had too much freedom too soon.  You don't give a young kid that freedom at that age.  He's posting.  It just doesn't happen.  Who knows? 
[02:36:30]  Mr. Devlin may have given quite a blowjob.  Maybe you pass that up.  Never know.  Here for socks.  Sorry, I was distracted because I couldn't hang up the phone.  Jeff in Wyoming.  Jeff?  Yeah, I listen mostly through audible.com.  And I was listening to a show from about a year ago last night.  And you guys started to play your first show together and you never got around to that again.  Good for you.  Fucking nice call.  You know, Anthony took my only copy.  You'll never hear it. 
[02:37:00]  You'll never see it.  Well, it was good, the part we heard.  Did you really take it?  Because I can't find it anymore.  It was so completely bad that I took it.  I scored the disc and snapped it into eight pizza slice-like pieces.  Dropped them all off in different trash bins.  Yeah, yeah.  I did that so it could not be recovered.  You don't think E-Rock has another copy ready to go?  I know he does.  I thought if I said pizza it would kind of distract him.  Mayonnaise.  Hey, can we hear like a couple of minutes of that?  No. 
[02:37:30]  I like the fact that you sound so young and Anthony sounds so happy.  We got to play one day.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Exactly.  We got to play one day.  And we got to do it right.  We got to invite the guys in and we just got to sit back and just take it.  I don't want to.  We have to sit back and take it.  Even if we have to look out the window and not look these guys in the eye.  You get embarrassed when you hear that?  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  It's the first show we ever did.  Dude, that show got us a job.  I was, well, maybe the subsequent shows got us a job. 
[02:38:00]  No.  That show got me in the door to do more shows with you.  What you don't understand is when we realized that we weren't staying at BAB and we were moving  on together, I got most of the bits for the demo that I sent out from that first show.  I was hammered.  And the radio community was just blown away.  He used to do 7 to midnight and I was in a band.  So I would come in at 7 o'clock at night. 
[02:38:30]  I'd already worked, gone to the ex-wife's bar where she was tending bar, drank, used to  drink when I drove everywhere.  I never drove anywhere without a bottle of beer right between my legs, driving, just  drinking the whole time.  And then at the studio, more drinking and just hammered.  And I could hear it in myself.  Like I hear, oh, I'm fucking, I'm just hammered.  I'm all happy to be there.  I'm laughing at everything a little too much. 
[02:39:00]  You know, it's like, yeah.  Yeah, I was, that's great how some people.  I'm touching some slack.  It was 12 years ago.  Some people are able to look at stuff that they did in the beginning and laugh at it.  Like I won't, I have tapes of me when I first started.  I'll do a standup.  I will not look at it.  Never, right?  I was dating this girl one time.  She goes, I want to see it.  She kept bugging me.  I go, fine, you want to see it?  Here it is.  And I left.  I went, I went to the-  Everyone else wants to see or hear it.  I went to the store.  I went to the store.  I had, or maybe I went to the other room. 
[02:39:30]  I can't remember.  Remember the second?  First of all, she saw me going over my big, like, red afro.  And she just, like, just immediately put her hands up to her mouth.  Oh, my God.  Like a horror movie.  I think my first joke is a pun.  I can't remember.  It's five of the worst.  Did you bring it in?  Never.  Yes, I brought mine in from 93.  Three years in the business.  We got to explain.  Yes, when we were at NAW, we used to do this bitch.  I think Jimmy starred it where you bring in, and this is where we're leading to our first  show, but we had all these guys bring in their early material, and it was brutal. 
[02:40:00]  The best one ever was Voss.  Voss is great.  The stuff is so, like, dated also, that, like, that stupid George Burns thing.  It was like George Burns' 100th birthday was coming up or something, so he was in the  news a lot.  And then it was a song that was being played on the radio all ad nauseum, like, every two  seconds, Get the Funk Out was being played.  So I did George Burns singing Get the Funk Out. 
[02:40:30]  How great is that?  We got to replay that.  And it's horrible.  Like, now I hear it and just can't.  I want to bite the microphone and anything around me, my own half.  I want to punch myself.  But that's why we got to set a day aside, and we have to just do it and let these guys  go.  Okay.  How about Friday?  This Friday?  No, no.  2028.  I can't listen to it.  How about you take the day off that day? 
[02:41:00]  It's impossible.  I could sit through it.  I could sit through it.  I know it's going to be brutal, but I could sit through it.  There are days where even this show, like a replay comes on, and it'll be on.  And I go, could you, I'll go to my girlfriend, I'll go, could you shut me off?  I cannot listen to another word out of my mouth.  I just get sick of me.  That had me this weekend.  I was actually walking to my hotel room, and it was the weirdest thing.  I dropped off my bags, and I was going back out to meet these people at this bar, and 
[02:41:30]  I'm hearing my voice as I'm having the door open.  I thought maybe sometimes I accidentally hit the recorder for my set, and that was on,  and I'm thinking it's not on.  It was somebody literally watching Comedy Central, and the next hotel room, and I'm hearing  my stupid voice, and I'm going, in the next room?  And I'm literally going like, you should have knocked on the door and said, could you turn  that shit down?  I was thinking in my head, stop yelling.  Do you have to yell every joke?  You're awful.  That's all I was thinking.  I literally, I started humming like an idiot. 
[02:42:00]  I tried to drown it out as I went down to get to the elevator.  You should have knocked on that door and freaked them out, man.  That would have been great.  Just knock on their door.  Oh, that would have been funny.  And freaked them out.  Can you shut that shit up?  They would tell that story for the rest of their lives.  Oh, yeah.  We were watching, and then the guy knocked on the door and go, can you turn down your  fucking TV and see if he even figures it out?  Then you realize it's the wrong room when you get your fucking throat cut.  He's watching porno.  I also wanted to leave before I heard somebody moaning, like, this guy sucks.  Oh, yeah, see?  That's another thing.  All he's doing is yelling. 
[02:42:30]  I can't, I'm like that.  I can't listen to it subjectively.  I can't just, I hear every little inflection, every line, every little pause, everything I hear.  You also, you also do, huh?  Why do you, you gotta do this.  Long Island's Best Rock, WBAB, Soul Asylum.  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from R.E.M. 
[02:43:00]  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  As you do the nighttime attitude, it's Opie aboard.  Thanks for checking out the program tonight.  And we got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  We got my pals.  I was way too nice.  My delivery is way too, hey, I'm your friend.  I don't want to.  I'm being edgy, but I'm also your friend.  Look, Anthony is coming up.  A lot of people agree like that, Anthony.  We always get to this point, and then we really can't go much further. 
[02:43:30]  I can't go much further between on board, and I'm fucking, like, Opie's running a pirate ship.  Thanks for coming on board, and I'm fucking, yeah, I'm just like, yeah.  He's like Paula Abdul.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, come on, I'm too fucking happy to be there.  This time around, we're only 28 seconds in.  Let's try to get to a minute.  No, not a minute.  No. 
[02:44:00]  At least try.  No.  Just tell me when you have to punch out.  I'm punching out.  No.  Tap.  No, no, no.  You got to stop when you tap.  All right, here we go.  Let's at least try to get to a complete minute.  He took his headphones off.  His 28 seconds.  His headphones are off.  He's covering himself with a coat.  Can I make some phone calls and conduct business during this segment?  Joe and Anthony from Rotgut, live in the studio.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Good, man.  Just in case people don't know who you are yet.  Yeah, well, that happens all the time. 
[02:44:30]  The famous authors of Gun Electric Shock OJ, which you're going to do live on the show  tonight.  That's right.  And you're going to do other ditties.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff, Ovi.  What's wrong with that?  That's a funny way to answer.  Shut the fuck up.  Anthony, that's good.  Shut it off.  I can't tell you.  He sounds like somebody doing a bad impression of George Carlin doing the wacky radio guy.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony, that was good.  By the way, this is no fucking bit.  He really is uncomfortable in his skin right now. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, I can't take this.  I know exactly what happened.  No, I can't do it.  I know what it's going through.  I'm not the kind of guy that can do this.  I can't do roasts.  I can't, like, be roast.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm getting major douche chills, but I'm, like, I'm dealing.  It's worse than douche chills, but with something deep-seated, I can't deal with it.  And you know what it is?  I'll freak out.  You're bringing on the humiliation now, because I'm not even thinking about making fun of Opie,  because you're underneath your coat right now.  But I can't.  You see?  Because there's a lot to make fun of me about.  Wait. 
[02:45:30]  No.  All you got to do is just admit.  I said ditties.  I said soul asylum, of course.  I'm your frequently neighborhood DJ.  Now Jim's going to pull his phony it's okay shit.  All right, here it comes.  Don't be such geese.  Opie made a good point.  He goes, we got a rocket here tonight, and Anthony went, that's right, Opie.  I think it's important to agree.  Listen, let's try.  You know what?  You're right.  You start to hear the chemistry between the two of them.  He was great.  That's where the chemistry began.  Right there. 
[02:46:00]  Right there.  Did you play that again?  Because I don't think I heard that.  I don't think I heard that.  I can't go backwards.  I usually go backwards with these things.  I can't.  Look, he's covered himself in it.  But that's where the chemistry began.  This is the first time we're on mic together, live in his studio.  Let's try, Anthony.  Oh, if there are aliens, please beam me up to a ship.  I don't want to be on this planet right now.  Dude, honestly.  Shut up.  How will he know you agree with him if you don't tell him?  That's right.  Opie, it's Opie.  You were correct.  All right, let's try to get to two minutes. 
[02:46:30]  No.  Let's try to get to two minutes.  I will say this.  I had a Friday night video.  It was my first TV spot recently, and I was trying to play it for my girlfriend.  Yeah.  I got through 30 seconds of it because I was a high-energy guy, and I was coming out like  the nervous, quirky guy, and I rubbed my head, and I went, how you doing?  I feel sexy.  And it was like this joke about how I'm not sexy, and I had to stop it.  Is the audio good?  It's from television. 
[02:47:00]  It's really clear.  Can you bring it in?  Is it good?  No.  Is it clear as a bell?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Can you bring it in?  Yeah, of course I will.  Yes.  This text from my sister Dawn Simple, ew.  My fucking sister just texted me E-W-W-W.  All right, let's try to get to two minutes today.  The last time we did this, I think we got about a minute in.  That was a misspell.  She was trying to write aww, A with a bunch of W.  No.  We're at 50 seconds in. 
[02:47:30]  She smells this stink.  We're at 50 seconds in.  Look, look, look.  And this first bit is 16 minutes, by the way.  16 minutes.  Can't the defense have a few words?  I hadn't done radio.  I was in a band.  You could never tell, though.  You were so mad.  Shut up.  This is me, after a few beers, trying to make some type of impression on the great Opie. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Who, at that point, was a radio.  You know, you had a radio career going for yourself.  And I would have loved to have gotten into radio.  I hate to say this, but at this point, counting college radio, I've been doing it a decade, so I have no excuses.  I wanted to do radio.  I was so nervous and so, like, wanting to have Opie go, oh, my God, this is great, because I knew this was my only foot in the fucking door.  I got lightning in a bottle.  So I was so overdoing things. 
[02:48:30]  Look, you know what, though?  That's exactly what happened that day.  I thought it was great, and, you know, it's dated now, of course, but as far as, like, two guys doing a show, there was, like, major potential there, and we've been writing it ever since.  I'm not going to be able to make it past George Burns.  All right, let's get it to two minutes here.  Don't get the funk out.  We're 49 seconds in.  Bill just winced.  Bill just visibly winced at me. 
[02:49:00]  Because I know what you're going through.  That's the funny thing about this fucking business is by the time everybody sees you, you know what you're doing, but there's no class on how to learn, how to do radio.  They'll teach them, and they'll take your money, but people will send you emails all the time.  Hey, I'm starting out doing stand-up.  You got any tips?  And it's just like the old school dad teaching you how to swim.  They just throw you in the deep end.  You're like, ah!  Sink or swim, you little fuck.  This is what I say.  Anyway, you're suffering, Anthony, but I think we're going to do this until you definitely can't take any more. 
[02:49:30]  I know this.  I'm there, man.  You're almost there.  This is so hard.  All right, back to the tape.  49 seconds in.  Don't look at me, Billy.  Just rip the band-aid off.  Just rip it off, man.  Just sit here.  I'm trying.  Here we go.  I'm trying to man up over here.  Let's move a little further in.  We're a little bitter.  We gave Eddie Vedder the idea to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what someone just said.  You know, they heard Pearl Jam's version of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, and they were expecting to hear the OJ version. 
[02:50:00]  He sounded like he was heavily sedated.  All right.  All right.  I need a ruling.  I started a new bit yesterday.  All right.  I'm out.  No, no, no, no, no.  Come on.  No, I'm out.  We'll give you a ruling?  Isn't this fucking hard?  I'll be honest.  Now I'm out.  Come on, Opie.  Opie.  I want to hear some of your old stuff.  I want to hear some of your old stuff.  No, dude.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Come out.  Come out.  It was fun, but it's not fun. 
[02:50:30]  There's five people in here.  Oh, wow, Bill.  I wonder what they're going to vote.  We're going to take a vote.  Come on.  It's America.  Stan, sit your face.  Oh, please.  You know how she's going to vote.  Oh, boy.  I'm so out.  I need to.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  I took a couple.  Opie, just take one.  This is so horrible.  Oh, what is that, Iraq?  Well, you guys do an Electric Shock OJ live.  Oh, Jesus.  What was the bit?  Because I would be willing to give a ruling.  I think it's fair.  This is radio history.  You can't deny me.  Oh, and it's fair.  It should remain. 
[02:51:00]  Like fucking Pompeii, buried in volcanic ash.  Come on.  It's horrible.  Opie, come on.  It's too dated.  Oh, my God.  I'm too happy to be there.  Opie's doing his radio show like.  Look.  I never deny that I did some hacky stuff.  All right.  Opie's not even looking at anybody.  Look at him.  He's staring at his fucking cereal like the Rain Man.  I had to listen to a boss back in the day because I had no choice.  This is so difficult. 
[02:51:30]  Blaming the audience.  Let it be known we haven't listened to a boss in over ten years.  This is.  I can't.  I can't deal.  Holy shit.  Holy.  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity Death Watch.  Right.  Yep.  All right.  You might have heard this last night.  Monday, Jessica Tandy, the old broad from Driving Miss Daisy died.  Stop smiling, Stan.  I'll take that contract.  How old is it?  It's 85.  Oh, please.  Anyways, I don't know about you, but I've always been under the. 
[02:52:00]  Celebrities die in threes, basically.  Always.  Always, right?  So it's the Celebrity Death Watch.  I guarantee two more prominent celebrities will die before October 1st.  I can't.  Dude, maybe it's a hacky bag.  That's not awful, though.  It's like you were just a local guy.  That, honestly, not that bad.  A Celebrity Death Watch.  I know.  I was actually enjoying it.  I'm wondering who the celebrity.  Shut up, you lying cunt.  No.  You're not.  Dude, honestly.  I'm telling you, honestly.  Like, the part that I think is really, like, the type that I would feel like a dick about 
[02:52:30]  is, like, okay, open it.  Like that.  All right, yeah.  But a Celebrity Death Watch.  Stop it.  Don't rub it in.  Not that bad.  It's extremely painful.  Some of it will be, but that.  Will be.  I honestly didn't think that part was that bad.  I'm going to be a dick.  No, I'm telling you.  You know me well if you don't mean sarcastic.  I'm really not.  Believe me, I'm sure plenty of this is horrid.  I still have a little.  I can't listen to one thing I say.  I'm barely hanging in there.  I'll be honest.  I'm on the ledge.  I got my fingernails. 
[02:53:00]  I can hear just a little more.  I fell.  I fell already.  A little bit.  I can't listen to one word out of my fucking mouth.  Not one word.  You're that chicken cliffhanger at the beginning.  Oh.  You just let go.  Yeah, I just let go.  I can't listen to one word without cringing.  I'm too happy to be there.  Before October 1st.  So we're just waiting and watching.  George Burns in the hospital the other day.  It was a close call.  Very close call.  But he got out of it.  98 years old.  He has like his brain is swelling.  He pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see. 
[02:53:30]  I'm out.  No, no.  Why?  That dude.  Are you looking at him?  Thank God the FCC wasn't listening.  Oh, no.  Such a harsh reaction.  Oh, no.  I was like, darn.  I was like, darn.  Darn.  Darn.  Jimmy, I'm just saying that Jimmy is picking up on all this.  Fucker.  Dude.  I'm just saying Jimmy's picking up on this.  Fine.  Fine.  And he's being the fuck about it.  Fine.  I'll.  We've got to play this on the other side.  No.  Darn.  Fine.  This is hard.  Darn should be a sound effect. 
[02:54:00]  Fine.  I'll rewind.  Darn.  But now I continue the tape.  No.  Because I'm going to stop right there.  I'm with you.  You weren't with me.  You jumped off.  I'm with you.  Opie.  Live long and prosper.  I'm with you.  He wasn't with you, Opie.  Shut up.  Totally wasn't.  What a dick.  I played the whole tape.  This is eight years old.  He has like, his brain is swelling.  And he pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see George Burr.  I can't.  How'd you guys land a job?  Like, weren't they afraid you'd get thrown off the air for language? 
[02:54:30]  Hey.  Did you throw your fist to the side?  Like, darn.  Gee willikers.  Boy.  You really were, Opie.  Came a long way from, yeah, I said fuck on the air, and I'll say it again.  Yeah, there you go.  That's when I was tough.  Dude, from darn to us.  That's a great question, by the way.  Speaking of faggots, we have calling in today.  Well, yeah.  Jesus, quite a progression.  Exactly.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I'm sweating.  Wow.  This just is beyond.  I know.  I'm all fucking sweaty hot now. 
[02:55:00]  Listen to this.  It's not even that bad, guys.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm telling you, it's not horrid.  It's just because you're in on the tape.  You feel it that way.  Yeah.  Yes.  But it's not.  Exactly is what I'm trying to say.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  It's not that bad.  Oh, I want to reach back and talk.  Of all the things I could do with a time machine, kill Hitler, you know what I'm saying?  No, I would go back to this ass on the radio and slap him silly and say, knock it off. 
[02:55:30]  Stop being so happy to fucking be here.  Here's the deal.  We've attempted this bit, I don't know, four or five times.  We've never gotten past George Burns singing Get the Funk Out.  I can't.  Let's try to at least get past that part of the tape.  It's so bad.  He pulled out.  He pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see George Burns singing that extreme song.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out. 
[02:56:00]  But he never does that.  Very good.  Maybe now after he's bopped on the head.  But I need a ruling.  I got an obituary.  Patrick O'Neill, 66.  People are going, Patrick who?  Now, I said it has to be a prominent celebrity.  This guy was in Stepford Wives, 1975.  What do you think?  It's on the fence.  Is he prominent?  Let me see, Joe.  What do you think?  I rule nay.  I rule nay.  All right.  So it's still one with two celebrities to go.  Two weeks from now.  Two to go.  Two to go. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  Well, we're going to debut real.  That was a great bit.  I can't.  It was a great bit.  You got past the George Burns thing, and it's actually just you guys, you're just talking.  No, no.  You guys got past it.  Yeah, I didn't get past it.  I'm still dealing with it right now.  I'm not past it.  Why did I care if George Burns sang Extreme?  The key is that you understood that a lot of people were curious.  No one wanted to hear that.  No, it made sense, because he's George Burns. 
[02:57:00]  Should I recreate the one?  I couldn't possibly.  Come on.  You fucking ass.  Couldn't get the song wrong this time, shithead.  Why wouldn't George Burns sing this?  Now that I think about it.  I thought it was really embarrassing.  I actually bought this tape and thought it was a good song, but it was out. 
[02:57:30]  Did you?  When did you buy it and where?  I don't know.  We're always going through your life when that happened.  Stop changing the subject.  I still want to try to fight our way out of this.  We'll fight our way out of this.  You got to a bad part, and what else is going to happen, and we can move on.  We should take a break, really.  You're in a decent part now.  I have incredible stamina today.  I don't know about you.  You feel great.  This is the first one.  What about XM?  You don't have to take breaks, and you can just fall.  That's too much.  You're like 45 minutes.  I got to pee.  This is the furthest we've ever gotten with the tape. 
[02:58:00]  Unless there's something horrible coming up.  Travis has a faggy picture holding a cat.  What?  I don't know.  I'm throwing out anything I can.  Shit.  Get the pic out.  Got emailed.  All right, you ass.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Rodgut.  About the Cuban refugees.  Right.  There was a...  What is wrong with this?  I say there's a very top goal.  Here's what's wrong with it.  Because Fidel Castro, there's a catwalk.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  What's wrong with this?  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I shut the fuck up for a minute?  Can I just let you talk without...  No.  There's a mic in front of me.  I couldn't shut up for two fucking seconds.  I had to agree with everything.  But Anthony, weren't you like excited to like beginning of fulfilling a dream?  Yeah, obviously.  That's the point that's so embarrassing is that I was put in this position where I could 
[02:59:00]  have been like cool and collected and done radio with an established radio show.  You know what?  But I was like a fucking giddy fucking little girl in there laughing and yucking it up.  See...  Oh, I'm disgusted with that audio.  Most radio guys...  I kind of liked it.  Here's the problem, man.  Shut up.  Here's the problem.  Most guys...  See those tapes.  Most guys didn't save their radio shows. 
[02:59:30]  I just happened to save everything.  Why did you save this?  Because I knew.  I just knew.  This should have been flung out the window.  He knew you guys were going to be great.  And, you know, a lot of those old Tonight shows don't even exist anymore.  So the fact that they have this...  They taped them, right?  Yeah.  Well, these actually are on kinescope.  You want...  I got my college radio tapes.  I'll bring those in.  No problem.  Now that I could listen to.  Yeah, but you have to bring something in.  You have to bring something in.  Jimmy, you have to bring something in. 
[03:00:00]  I have very embarrassing songs.  Sam and Sam will just play your show you did two weeks ago.  I have very embarrassing, sappy, 80s-type songs that me and my brother wrote.  All right.  That are really bad.  Really incredibly bad.  Why don't we have one of those...  Deuce Chill shows.  Yeah, we'll go rewind or whatever you want to call it.  And we'll rewind.  Oof.  All right.  Let's see if we can get a little further in the pit here.  Yeah.  Oof is right.  I'll take a minute.  We've never been on that one.  All right, listen to this song that these guys came up with. 
[03:00:30]  And with Fidel Castro dying any day, it's very topical to me.  Oh, is it?  12 years later.  How about the Cuban refugees?  Right.  There was a...  Billy Joel made a tribute to the Baymen.  Right.  And we figured, you know, why not go to the other southern half of the states and make  a little tribute to the Cuban boat people?  Let's check it out on the Nighttime Attitude.  I think it just goes in and out.  The whole song.  Of course, you're playing for a parody. 
[03:01:00]  And I hope I can roll very fast.  I've been out for about 15 minutes.  And the water is up to my ass.  Didn't see that coming.  I'm leaving Cuba like my brother did before.  Him and his family sailing on the bathroom door. 
[03:01:30]  My poor dead cousin was too dumb to build a boat.  He learned the hard way that a Buick doesn't float.  Now I sail on a cheese enchilada.  And the water is up to my neck.  But the one thought that keeps us on the wing is of cashing our first welfare check. 
[03:02:00]  It's not fair, dude.  We're leaving Castro not because he's to be feared.  We're just embarrassed by El Presidente's fear.  That hairy madness.  You know he must have light.  My mother's beard's long, but at least she keeps it nice.  It's not bad at all, man. 
[03:02:30]  It's dated.  What are you going to do?  It's not much, but it's all that I've got.  How I wish I was Ricky Ricardo.  Because his drum would seem just like a yacht.  Babaloo.  Oh, you've got to love that. 
[03:03:00]  Don't open the paper and start reading it during one of my parodies, motherfucker.  I just dump water on Pilsk's newspaper.  That, um, the only, maybe if you did that now, there might be one or two lines you would  make a little better.  But that was good, man.  I mean, I'd love to trash you.  Thank you. 
[03:03:30]  Fucking, there was, uh, what was one line?  It was really, oh, on the bathroom door.  It was good.  Oh, yeah.  Buick doesn't float.  Back in the old, uh, strong party writing day.  Let's say hi to Rude Dog.  We've never gotten this far in the tape.  We're five minutes in.  Uh, Rude Dog, what's up?  The nighttime attitude?  Ugh.  Cocksuckers.  You have a fun thing.  Hold it.  Cocksuckers.  Yeah, well.  You're bored.  All right.  It's not helping the heat issue.  Well, the nighttime attitude turned into the O&A virus.  See, it had to start somewhere.  Rob in Iowa, what's up? 
[03:04:00]  Thank you.  It had to start somewhere for the love of fuck.  They didn't just start building fucking skyscrapers, you asses.  You don't stop with the, you start with the top floor.  Exactly.  That's what everybody's saying.  So, you know, keep playing the tape.  The basement's usually a very ugly place.  Right.  You gotta start somewhere.  Foundations, dirt and cement.  Yeah, you, look at the.  You gotta get pretty windows in chrome.  Dirt, cement, and song parodies.  Look at the first computer.  Look at, uh, look at, uh, the old Discman is now the tiny little shuffle that iPod has. 
[03:04:30]  So you gotta start somewhere.  Thank you.  Uh, the creativity was there, though.  Right?  I, uh, Rob in Iowa, what's up?  See it.  Yeah, I just wonder where I can order some rock gut music.  Actually, Joe's still, uh, peddling rock gut stuff, right?  Of course.  I don't know where.  Ant doesn't even know where.  Joe's in Vegas, uh, I think at the Mirage for a month, all month long.  Doing U2?  Yeah.  Are they staying at the Mirage?  I think so.  Jesus.  I know. 
[03:05:00]  Apparently, if you can't get U2, you get my brother.  That's, can we book U2?  No, they're busy.  Get me, Joe.  And the amazing thing is, he has a new Bono every week.  Yeah.  And he still pulls it off somehow.  That's it.  All right.  Uh, so far, not bad.  So why don't we continue?  There's one thing.  I will be completely honest.  As soon as it happens, because I know it will happen, I am completely out, and you're going  to have to fight me to push play again.  I know what you mean.  I'm not even kidding.  I know what you mean.  You will have to physically fight me, sit on me, and then hit play again. 
[03:05:30]  Ah.  Because that will be it for me.  That will be it for me.  It really hasn't been that bad.  So far, I'm all right.  No, I'm not.  But there's one thing he knows.  I think Jimmy knows.  I don't know.  No, you do know, Joe.  This is the kind of radio I would have listened to back then.  Shut up.  I'm telling you, there's one thing, and it's coming, and when it does, I'm done.  I know when you're punching out.  Done.  There's no explanation.  I have explained it, but...  My phone is going off like crazy. 
[03:06:00]  Another text.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Oh, it's dawn again.  All right.  Ah, okay.  Ugh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Imperial.  Remember that.  Maybe it's a song or something?  Don't be so cryptic, Dawn, you dummy.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's, uh...  Yeah, I'm lashing out.  I love that.  Rock God on the nighttime attitude.  And on the eighth day... 
[03:06:30]  St. John's.  Founded by the Vincentian community in 1870.  Long Island's best rock, WBAB.  Hold his eyes up.  Oh, we're live.  102.3 WBAB.  Oh, Long Island.  It's Opie and the nighttime attitude.  All right.  All right.  I got through that.  It's bad.  I get it, but I'm all right.  Well, it sounded like you were going to say live in Long Island, and you just, you, like, 
[03:07:00]  tripped the words.  Yeah.  Well, duh.  My stammering started way back then.  Who are you kidding?  It's fine.  Holy crap.  So, there's something with my blood pressure.  Oh, Long Island.  It's Opie and the nighttime attitude.  Squeeze, of course, and Tempted.  Sending that out to Sally in Levittown, faithful listener of the program.  Oh, you just have to do it.  My choice, Opie.  I'm out of my mind tonight, because I got Joe and Anthony from Rotgut, and these guys  are...  That would be us.  You guys are mental.  That's right.  But thanks for stopping on by.  I appreciate it.  No problem. 
[03:07:30]  Anytime.  We're glad to do it.  Why am I talking like that?  Because he's crazy.  Why am I doing that?  You're nutty.  Why am I...  Just fucking talk, you dumb fuck.  Why?  But it was funnier to go, Annie...  Can you play that again?  Like, his delivery was impressive.  Timmy, we're going to get your first appearance on this show.  Dude, my...  I came in...  There's nothing you'll do.  If you blew each other on air, it wouldn't be as embarrassing as my 1993 tape that I played,  How I Did It, where I was the high-energy, please-love-me guy. 
[03:08:00]  I want to hear it.  That went to the core of who I was.  This is just newness and nervousness.  That's funny.  That was your most honest stuff was when you first went on stage.  Jimmy, will you bring it in tomorrow?  I'll bring in my better one, which is the Friday night videos one, because the audio is  clear.  Yeah, let's get it clear.  Yeah, of course.  I have it on DVD.  All right.  All right.  If you agree with that...  Oh, Joe's at the Imperial.  Oh, that's what it was.  The Imperial.  No problem.  Anytime.  We're glad to do it.  Pizza DeLuso, Comac.  Oh, gee.  That would be Cliff.  Yeah, no.  That would be Cliff, Joe, and Greg.  Oh, come on, Joe.  All we have to do is say it ten times, and we get it. 
[03:08:30]  Joe is the king of the plug from day one.  Day one, Joe would just plug everything.  So, apparently, if he said Pizza DeLuso ten times, they were going to bring a pizza bar.  So, yeah.  And I was always kind of a little embarrassed by that whole aspect.  I thought, perhaps, you know, as I'm trying to latch on to a radio career here, doing my great, great material, that maybe just plugging to get a free pizza, that wasn't the time nor place. 
[03:09:00]  Let's say hi to Madonna, Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, who's playing at Sundance this weekend, boys?  You know.  I don't know what happened to the phone there.  I got something.  On Mars, the phones, they exploded.  I really don't know.  I got to say, though, I mean, ten plugs for a free pie.  I mean, that Joe, what a negotiator.  Yeah, really?  Christ.  Really?  What's up?  Eight minutes of airtime.  How much was a pie in 94?  Jesus.  $6.95?  Right.  He plugged for a $7 food item. 
[03:09:30]  The movie was four bucks.  Jesus.  Sixty cents off the bill for each plug.  Say it ten times, and we get a free pizza.  Are you serious?  They deliver it.  They're going to deliver it right here.  All right, do it real fast.  Go.  Guys, that would be pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso, pizza de Lusso,  pizza de Lusso.  That's five, six.  Pizza de Lusso, seven.  I said it, too.  Pizza de Lusso.  Oh, so that's ten.  We're up to 12.  That's a fine and a half.  All right, all right.  So, Joe, Cliff, get in your van and start down here.  I want one with everything on it.  That's great.  My boss is going to love that one.  That was about $1,000 worth of advertisement. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too.  Oh, no.  Dude, I'm a Kinison fan.  You didn't tell me he showed up.  All right.  You guys were getting a big guess back then?  All right.  Hold on.  I have to leave.  I really.  Dude, a celebrity came in.  This is the second time in a week that Anthony co-host is walking off of a program on 202.  You know what?  I got to admit, Anthony, I'm not being a dick, but this is actually, on a lot of levels, 
[03:10:30]  really cool to listen to.  Yeah?  This is where you start out.  Yeah, sure.  Try to keep me in the room.  Try your best.  You could bring in a lot of a douche coupe to fucking sit on my face, and I would still  get up and leave.  Anthony.  I can't listen.  I love Sam Kinison.  There's got to be a rule where you can't leave.  That's why I'm leaving.  Opie, there's got to be a rule where you can't leave.  How can you have douche chills if you leave?  Hey, he's got this on out there. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, he's got 50%.  What can I tell you?  I can fucking leave.  He's got 50%.  What can I tell you?  I'm leaving.  It's, uh...  That's fine.  I'm going to actually take a leak, I think.  Sam Kinison, everybody.  Keep it going for Sam Kinison.  Walk around.  I might go downstairs and get some air.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too.  Hey, old man.  How you doing, Ben?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we're hanging out with the guys tonight.  That's a good impression, Anthony.  Where you going?  It's not bad Kinison.  Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  He's walking down the hall, and he's mic'd by E-Rock. 
[03:11:30]  By the way, this is no bit.  Get away.  Don't look at me.  He's in the bathroom now.  I'm going to take a piss.  Nope.  No one will laugh.  This seriously, honestly, is one of the, I think as an entertainer, is one of the toughest  things you could do is just bring out, like after you've achieved the level of success  and then bring out just when you sucked and just totally take away that whole illusion 
[03:12:00]  that you were always good.  It's fucking brutal.  It's no joke.  But the thing is, is he's not that bad.  That Sam sounded good.  You know who loves listening to their old stuff?  People that have failed in entertainment.  They love yanking out the tapes and the videos and showing their friends, like, yeah, look  what I did, and they show old stand-up because they never got better.  Or Bob Kelly, in his case, who's just doing the same jokes.  Most people really get the deuce chills, though, every time they look at their old stuff. 
[03:12:30]  You're kind of supposed to.  You want to hear the Sam Kinison while he's in the back?  Yeah, it wasn't a bad Kinison.  Yeah, tonight, too.  Sam.  Hey, old man.  How you doing, bud?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we're hanging out with the guys tonight, having a good time.  From Rod Cut?  Yeah, I'm hoping that pizza comes down.  I'm losing a little weight being dead.  Hey, Sam, what do you think of O.J. Simpson?  Guilty as sin.  I was talking to Nicole and her waiter friend.  Yeah, she said he came up, looked pretty angry, stuck a knife in her. 
[03:13:00]  You know, the whole deal.  Okay.  Very good.  But speaking of which, I think it's time to do Gun Electric Shock O.J. live on the night.  Okay, that goes like that.  Let's get right to my time attitude.  It's Rod Cut.  Check this out.  Popeye Kinison.  All right.  He said Popeye Kinison.  And cut.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you do?  Whoa, whoa.  What are you doing?  That you were worried about.  You do something you said.  Honestly, we're seven minutes in.  All right.  Well, that's going to have to wait for another time.  Did you do something bad?  We got to the point, the guys got to remember, we got seven minutes in, finally. 
[03:13:30]  Right after Kinison.  And right after Kinison, they're about to play Gun Electric Shock O.J. live, which is  not bad whatsoever.  That was the song that brought Anthony to my attention.  I started playing the song, then this is their first visit on the show.  What was it about his first time in there, seriously, that made you think?  His voices and just how quick he was.  It was amazing how quick he was.  You know, when you're a radio guy, you're always hoping to find someone you can bounce  off of.  And whatever we were talking about, he had something to say about it. 
[03:14:00]  Well, I didn't know about his thing back then.  So he was still in the band with Joe?  Yeah.  And he was a tin knocker and all that.  Yeah.  So did Joe know that he actually wanted to get into radio?  Joe was the one that kind of pushed it.  Joe was the one that would show up at the back door at BAB banging on the door.  I'm like, oh, it's this Joe guy again.  Joe was plugging the band constantly.  Just pushing hard.  And you might want to play this on the show.  And unlike the Godsmack debauchery, I actually listened to the stuff and went, holy shit, 
[03:14:30]  is this stuff good?  They were great at song parties.  What happened to Godsmack gave you a tape way back in the day and he didn't listen?  I threw it in a river.  Threw it out the window.  So he was a friend of our show.  He would come on a lot.  Oops.  And he was doing some kind of drum, what is it called?  Solo?  No, like a, what's the word?  Circle?  Snare drum.  Bass drum.  Seminar.  I had it.  Like a seminar, like a clinic.  A drum clinic.  And we broadcasted live because there was a big client up there at one of the music stores. 
[03:15:00]  Yes, we did.  Yeah.  And then...  And then...  It's going to be like the old Anthony.  And then, yeah, he's like, hey, there's my new project.  And he gave us a disc.  He gave everybody in Boston a disc.  A disc, yeah.  At that point, we were...  So, at that point, we were...  Dick.  We listened to so many band tapes.  It's like, no one is going to give us anything that's worth listening to at this point.  So my friend was in the car with me.  I said, dude, roll down the window.  And I actually threw it into the...  I think it's called the Connecticut River, officially, that goes through Boston. 
[03:15:30]  Uh-huh.  And threw it.  And then, that same tape was given to another jock at AAF.  And he basically broke the band.  And every article that was written about Godsmack for the first three years, they mention this guy.  They mention this guy as the guy that broke the band.  Because one day, he just decided...  The story goes, I don't know how true it is.  He decided to play it on his own.  You know, this...  Yeah.  Was it Rocco?  Yeah, it was Rocco.  Yeah, dude.  All right, Ant, we're seven minutes in.  You're playing Gun Electric Shock OJ Live. 
[03:16:00]  You want to hear that, or you want to bail?  I don't...  You know something?  I don't get it over with.  I did not want to hear the Sam Kinison.  So you're all right with that?  I'm glad I wasn't in the room.  All right, you're all right with that?  Because it's awful.  It was like...  It was like just set up, and hey, look who's in the studio.  And then I...  You know, I had to do it.  I wanted to, you know, perform.  It was kind of throwing a...  Like a fish...  Yeah, it was a performing seal.  So I had to do it.  But there really wasn't any context to it.  And it's just embarrassing. 
[03:16:30]  The fun part of that was the beginning when you went,  uh, yeah, hi, Opie.  Like you said hi to Opie as Sam.  All right.  You know something, Jimmy?  Why?  I was saying that was the fun part.  Yeah.  I love Jimmy.  There's a few people saying that, you know, this stuff is better than most shows on radio  today.  Oh, shut up.  Who is calling the deaf?  This is awful.  Fucking awful. 
[03:17:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  I think O'Darn...  I'm a fucking idiot.  O'Darn is a funny clip to have, like, in the box.  All right.  I do.  You should hit that sometime.  It's actually a silly one to have.  It's silly.  Nothing is worse than shut up as a one-second sound clip.  Yeah, but we don't really have that.  See, it's the authentic take.  Yeah, if you actually had that moment of embarrassment.  All right.  Why don't we, um...  You want to hear Gun Electric Shock OJ live?  This is the song that...  Any time.  This was live, huh?  This is live, and this is... 
[03:17:30]  Ooh.  This is the reason we do a show to this day.  Oh, we got to hear this.  This was back when, uh...  This is the song we talk about in articles from time to time.  OJ, of course, we know what OJ did, and before his trial, though, everybody knew he was guilty  and assumed that he'd be put to death, death penalty, and that's what the song was kind  of about, and, uh, yeah, in hindsight, this song really dated.  And you've taken a beating.  I've been relatively unscathed here, except for a darn in the nighttime attitude and a couple 
[03:18:00]  of dumb things, but I do have a motive here.  I'm trying to get to the point that will completely make me leave, and that douche.  Well, that'll probably come with an end of a phone call or something like that.  And I think we're heading toward a phone call, too.  I'm not really sure.  I'm heading toward disaster.  So here's Rockett doing an Electric Shock OJ live back in 94.  Joe Sperry.  Good guitar work.  I'm sitting in Los Angeles jail 
[03:18:30]  And that judge won't let me post my bill  Now this could be the end of me  Cause California's got that death penalty  They gone Electric Shock OJ  Cook my behind like a chicken croquet  Ooh  They gone Electric Shock OJ 
[03:19:00]  Toast my behind  Toast my behind  Nicole, I really loved that girl  But she had the worst luck in the world  I was only cleaning my knife  I accidentally stabbed her 36 times  They gone Electric Shock OJ 
[03:19:30]  Cook my behind  Like a cherry flambe  Ooh  They gone Electric Shock OJ  Toast my behind  Looks like I'm a guilty man  Love lots of women  Now I'm gonna have to love my hand  But what's worse  Will make me flip my lid 
[03:20:00]  I hear Michael Jackson is watching my kids  Why don't they cut me some slack  I'm an athlete, movie star, and I'm black  Whilst lawyers argue over my hair  Why don't they be warming up  That electric coach, yeah  Ooh  They gone Electric Shock OJ  Cook my behind 
[03:20:30]  Like a flounder fillet  Ooh  They gone Electric Shock OJ  Across my behind  That hurts  Give me a call  Give me, give me the hell out of here  I was in Chicago, I swear  I wasn't even the other girl  They gone Electric Shock OJ 
[03:21:00]  Boy, I do that whistle better than any better  Bravo  That's good improv  That was not written by a professional comic  That was a slower version of the song, by the way  Now  You slowed it down slightly  Well, of course  It really wasn't that bad, Ant  Well, you know  The shocking sound  Back in 1994  It was topical  It was very topical 
[03:21:30]  Come on  I really want to get to a phone call  It's not bad, dude  I mean, it's like  The guitar work is actually really impressive  And it's like  It's not what  Joe can play anything  He's great  Joe's an amazing guitarist  Anything  He's amazing  I will start banning critics on PalTalk  Here, first of all  Just as like a warning  I'm just firing a random shot  Boom, you're bounced 
[03:22:00]  Look at that  Just somebody out of nowhere  So I wheeled my iron fist  What kind of critics?  What are they criticizing?  It was written by  Shut up  No, written by a guy who was not a professional comic  You were a guy who just fucking  Had a knocking tin  And you wrote  Thanks for your sympathy  But that's true, though  Like, I was doing comedy  For three  I was on television when I did what I did  You were just a guy with his brother  Who fucking wound up blowing up into a radio star  I was on television  I was in comedy  He's helping me 
[03:22:30]  But it's the truth  Believe me  There's nothing I want more than to trash you  But it's not accurate  I want to  Let's see if we can move on here  I want to get out of this  We're almost there  No  Not that bad, Anthony  Keep playing it  Hey, Joe  I think you did whistle better than me  We're hanging out with Rod Gut on the Nighttime Attitude  They got a song about the guy that crashed into the White House  Oh, that kook  That we're going to debut in a few that you're going to love  And if you've got something to add to the program tonight  Give us a call  955-WBA-Bay 
[03:23:00]  What does he's going to make it  True  102% Long Island  We're WBA  That's more than 100%  That's a lot of Long Island folks  Well, there's a small 2% no one talks about  I figured I'd  A small little town in the middle of Long Island  That doesn't get any attention  What's even better is the awful music you're coming out of  Into that crap  This is unbearable, dude 
[03:23:30]  Look how red you are  You're totally red  I'm fucking sweating  I am sweating  I can't sit through this  102%  102%  Yeah  Look how red you are  And it was a home of rock and roll  I worked for three homes of rock and roll over the years  Nighttime Attitude  I worked for  I think I worked for two stations named after animals  And one station that really rocks  955-WBA-Bay

[03:33:30]  And lesbians  Instead of Lebanese  Alright  That's on the way  What about  Do we have Mike Woods  Is there anything there or no?  That's the one I was handing out  The last tease  Fox 5 did an American Idol spoof  With our favorite weather guy  Mike Woods  And with American Idol starting tonight  This is supposedly really  Really douche chilly  We'll get into that as well  Time to take some leaks boys  Ah  Pressure  It's awful  Lopey and Anthony  These guys thrash  Hard  Come on 
[03:34:00]  No  We'll be right back 
[03:34:30]  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Ant was making a good point about the first show we played a little bit.  It's the first we've gotten into that tape, 12 minutes in.  And Ant reminded everyone during the break that you've got to remember,  I wasn't doing radio yet.  I was a guest on the show, and then the next day I was back in an attic,  was banging away.  You were a disc jockey who was trying to carve something original. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, I was trying to move forward.  Yeah, you were trying to hone a craft.  And I was a construction worker on a one-day guest shot on your show  because I wrote a wacky fucking song about OJ.  Jesus Christ.  And that turns into this empire.  What the fuck?  Holy fucking, how did that happen?  And then there's a morning guy.  We'll let him slide today because he is kind of a friend of the show. 
[03:35:30]  But he was the morning guy back then at BAB.  And he started playing the stuff Ant and I were doing at night  and trying to make believe it was his stuff.  And there's Ant hearing his own voice on BAB from a really hot attic.  From an attic or a rooftop somewhere.  The guy would play one of the song parries or whatever, one of the voices Ant did the night before.  Just play it like, hey, we got Sam Kinison on the phone or whatever.  I hope not.  Or whatever.  Yeah, I'm just trying to get an example. 
[03:36:00]  And just make believe it was connected to his show.  Yeah.  And never said, you know, this was Anthony from, you know, last night or any of that crap.  Then they offered me your job.  Then they offered me, yeah.  When we got a job to go to Boston, we finally, you know, got the call.  The deal was I'm hiring you and Anthony to do afternoon drive at AAF.  I was thrilled.  That was your job.  It's a fucking gig.  I'm in radio.  And then they came up to me and said, look, you know, if Opie goes up to Boston, that's fine and all. 
[03:36:30]  He's like, no, it's me and Opie going up to Boston.  Yeah, we know.  We know.  But, you know, he could still go.  He does radio, knows his job.  He could go up there and he'll do fine.  This is why this business stinks.  He'll do fine.  But we would like you to take over his shift down here.  You stay at BAB from 7 to midnight.  Which would have fucked my whole fucking career up, by the way.  It would have fucked everything up.  First of all, I'd have failed miserably because I didn't know how to do radio, obviously, especially alone. 
[03:37:00]  You'd have been drunk, just goofing off with your friends, playing fucking guitar.  Missing breaks.  Not only that, who in that place wouldn't have fucking hated me?  I'd just come trotting in.  I need a board op because I don't even know what the fucking thing looks like.  And there's some asshole who's been eking out weekends for fucking ever that would like to a little step up.  And I step in there.  Hi, I'm the new night guy.  You know, they would have killed me.  I'd have been assassinated.  A butt tall in your hand.  Yeah.  Hey, fuck it.  I'm drinking.  And Ope would have been up in Boston.  And I would have been up because I would have lost the following I did build up at the time. 
[03:37:30]  It just would have been a clusterfuck.  But that's why radio stinks in the end.  Instead of BAB giving us afternoons there and seeing what would have happened.  What is the whole mindset there?  Hey, why pay two when we can only pay one?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like that?  Why would they, if it was working between the two of you, why wouldn't they move us up to afternoons?  BAB was one of these stations that I was the first hire, first full-time hire in like a decade.  You know, they didn't change shit. 
[03:38:00]  It was the type of place DJs basically died there, basically.  So I was like the first full-time hire for many, many, many years.  And now it was like that was dramatic enough, changing the lineup.  But now to take this show and move it into one of the big time slots, like Afternoon Drive or Moorings,  they're like, what are you, insane?  We can't do that.  We don't know how that would work.  There's not a chart for that.  There's no chart for that.  We're afraid.  It was in afternoons.  Like, was it a show or was it just music? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, it was a show that was doing well.  Who was it?  Ralph?  No, Ralph was doing Middays, I believe, back then.  Right.  It was either Roger or Jerry Mortier.  I think they were splitting the shit.  Jerry's gin joint.  Which was a very, very creative show.  Very popular, creative show I used to listen to on Friday.  He would make believe he's in a bar every Friday for a happy hour,  like he's doing a live broadcast from a fucking bar.  With sound effects and everything.  And you'd swear he was in a fucking bar.  And I was radio savvy, because I got into this very young.  I believed that he was at a bar. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, I thought it was.  Simple as that.  He's like, hey, we're over by the pool table now.  And you'd hear like, people shooting pool.  He was in a cold studio by himself, making believe he was in a bar broadcasting.  Sound effects, jukebox, make believe party.  Making believe girls were dancing on the bar, and he just had all the sound effects perfect.  He fucking made a party.  He's sitting there alone, and it was a fucking bar that you listened to and went,  I fucking want to be there.  I want to fucking be at this party going on in this bar.  And then, you know, the station would get phone calls every Friday. 
[03:39:30]  Where is this?  Where is it?  Because he would explain where it is, sort of, like, we're in, like, the outskirts of  Babylon on, you know, just off 347 near.  So it was like, hey, if you're by, stop in, because we're having a great time here.  Or, you know, get here soon, because they're not going to let any more people in the night  after another 10, 15 minutes.  It was always, like, beer popping.  Big enough where it could be possible.  Beer popping.  Yeah, he'd be like, right, we're buying beers.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  Give me three. 
[03:40:00]  And you're like, action over at the dartboard.  Right.  Like, holy shit, there's a fucking party going on.  Why aren't we there?  And it was just some guy in a studio alone just hitting pushing buttons and crumpling up  paper in front of the microphone.  Yeah.  Pushing buttons and just talking over sound effects and crowd noises.  It was great.  That was a bummer when I started working there and I realized that it really, where's Jerry's  gin joint?  I walked in one day and it was so depressing.  Just sitting there in a cold studio.  I'm like, holy shit, you're like, you're doing happy hour every Friday.  Wait, now, is this guy doing a regular show and then every Friday do that? 
[03:40:30]  Or that was his only gig?  I don't want to hear an air check.  I think he would do a regular show and then Friday.  I would love to hear an air check.  Friday afternoon happy hour.  He's got a good gig here in New York.  He does Q104 still.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's got air check.  I hear him every once in a while.  I actually heard him over the weekend doing a show.  Yeah, that was something.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Creative for the time especially.  Hey, man, does Tom like us sick?  Someone said he's really sick.  Is that true or no one knows?  No.  God hope so.  Come on.  God hope so. 
[03:41:00]  You're not going to get a darn from me today.  Unless someone says no, he's not.  Yeah, exactly.  He's not on out here, is he?  No.  I'd say he was sick.  I don't know.  I do the same show.  Every day.  Every day.  Tom like us.  One topic per hour.  I'm Tom like us.  Go to the phones.  Bob from a car phone.  Let's talk about girls with yeast infections today for the next hour.  Talk about the topics. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Oh, shut up.  Why is it that girls like guys that are Italian?  What is it?  He actually went off on that one day.  Why is it like the tall, dark, and handsome guys are the guys that are...  What?  What?  You bitches.  Like us 101.  Teach you how to hate women.  Hit them with a U-log during Christmas and throw her in the fireplace.  Allegedly.  What?  Even though the police have a report. 
[03:42:00]  There must be some ghost sightings out there because all over Instant Feedback, they're just  writing boo a million times in a row.  Oh, really?  Like boo, boo, boo, boo?  Yeah, there's like boo, boo, boo.  How do you know it's that tone?  Like can't it be spoken lower?  Like boo, boo.  Or maybe even higher. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know, man.  Yeah, like boo, boo, boo.  And then Jim from New Brunswick.  Like, hey, what's Yogi Bear's little pal's name?  You queer.  Thank you, Jim.  Always a pleasure.  It was memorable.  All right, here we go.  Fox 5 Morning News does American Idol impressions.  This is with Mike Wood.  Ah, Mike Wood.  Mike Woods.  I think it's Mike Wood.  Bill Burr playing the DC Improv this weekend. 
[03:43:00]  That's right.  Have you been there before?  It's a good reminder.  Yes, it's a wonderful room.  And it's got a nice wide alley to make it to the stage.  It's wonderful construction.  I've never been there.  Oh, you've never been there?  Is that a problem?  Oh, I thought you've been there.  Jim, which one did you play back in the day?  The way they designed it is the green room is in the back, and then there's the stage.  Oh, shit.  And I guess to just, you know, keep the performers being able to get to the stage quickly,  they put a curtain along the side of the wall and then the front part of the wall that 
[03:43:30]  leads to the stage that is maybe, I don't know, about six inches wide.  And as you walk through, you're literally bumping the asses of the customers as you walk up.  And the weirdest thing ever is when you get off stage, you walk, what is it, you already  told this story?  No.  I've never been there.  When you go to get off the stage, why do you feel like I'm the douche right now?  You're not.  Oh, God forbid you're the douche for once.  Yeah, Jesus, Sam.  Maybe because we were, you've been looking at people that felt like they were the douche  for about an hour and a half.  We still got the...  No, I just sensed a laugh that was...  We still haven't gotten the douche out of our faces. 
[03:44:00]  That's what we're seeing.  Oh, I'm kind of fascinated by the way they set this...  So anyway, so when you get off stage and people enjoyed your set, you're walking, it's  like a haunted house, you're walking along this black curtain and these arms are kind of  pushing through, grabbing at you.  Grabbing at you through material.  And then also, they kind of figure out after the first two performers that that's where  you walk through.  So as they're introducing you, people on the other side of the curtain, you can't say,  have a good show, Bill.  Giving you a pep talk.  What a dopey way to do that.  It's really freaky.  Somebody reached through and like, I don't know. 
[03:44:30]  Stole your wallet?  You know, like, kind of like, squeezed my shoulder and it was just, it was fucking freaky.  These faceless hands just coming and groping you.  Yeah, it was awful.  Now I have the ONA for, I'm just waiting for you to punch back through the curtain.  That's something you would do.  Just like, pop some dude.  Knock it off!  I'm more the inanimate object guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, let's do the Fox 5 Morning News Does American Idol Impressions.  Please.  Simon, Randy, and Paula get ready for the next contestant.  This is Mike Woods as Randy. 
[03:45:00]  The blonde broad who put on a, a, a, a black wig, a dark wig, right.  To be Paula.  And then some other dude.  Joella?  Joiella?  Mark Joiella.  Mark Joiella.  Keeping it local for the New Yorkers.  Mark Joiella.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm doing, uh...  They're the same douches you have in your city, just with different names.  Believe me.  They look the same.  They act the same.  They're news douches.  All right.  I'm gonna...  I'm scared to go to this phone call. 
[03:45:30]  Uh...  I...  Jim from New Hampshire?  Uh, Jim?  Hey, Jim.  Jim?  Jim.  Jimmy.  Jim, you're on the air.  Whoever from New Hampshire.  Say hi.  Speak.  Everyone on the phone.  Just say, hey, how you doing?  What a douchebag.  All right.  Good.  Damn it.  I wanted to hear that.  I don't know what that was.  I don't remember.  I'm being completely honest.  I don't know if I used to say that.  He's saying I used to say, uh...  We're doing the hang and bang? 
[03:46:00]  No.  Wasn't that what we used to goof on?  I hope so.  I don't remember.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Oh, yeah.  What was that?  All right.  Here we go.  And that looks like Randy, Paula, and Simon hanging out waiting for the next, uh...  The next victim.  I was almost fooled.  You can barely tell the difference.  You guys...  Exactly.  You guys are looking good.  Looking real good.  Simon is grumpy already, but we gotta tell you, we love New York City.  It is the city where dreams come true.  You can be all that you want to be. 
[03:46:30]  Paula, Paula, Paula, please.  If cliches were crimes, you'd be headed up the river already.  Oh, come on, dog.  You're always in such a bad mood.  I'm falling.  Mike just goes, oh, come on, dog.  And then nothing.  All nervously.  Oh.  Wasn't sure if it was the right time.  I figured he would give it a shot.  He has the worst improv.  It's like, no, no feel for it or whatever.  He just knows he has to say that line somewhere in there.  And he opens with the catchphrase.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  What an asshole.  Put that in the middle somewhere.  Kicking up this guy.  You should at least say hello to Simon in the voice.  You're always in such a bad mood.  I'm falling.  What's wrong with you?  I'm falling.  She's horrible.  You can't find a different colored shirt?  Oh, poor Mike.  That's Mike again.  Poor Mike.  He's a weather guy.  Why are they putting him in these situations?  Oh, wait.  I got to back up to come on, dog.  And then he tries to do a little better.  He couldn't ask him.  But he's terrible. 
[03:47:30]  He can't.  When Shays were crimes, he'd be headed up the river already.  Oh, come on, dog.  You're always in such a bad mood.  I'm falling.  What's wrong with you?  I'm falling.  She's horrible.  You can't find a different colored shirt?  It's all you got.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  They both punched out.  Oh, Jesus.  They're in the bit with him, and they punched out.  Well, they couldn't believe it was done.  They're like, that was the punchline?  Please be appalled.  This was like douche chills in real time.  Oh, this is horrible. 
[03:48:00]  Play that part again.  Maybe something could kill that.  Oh, come on, dog.  You're always in such a bad mood.  I'm falling.  What's wrong with you?  I'm falling.  She's horrible.  You can't find a different colored shirt?  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know where to go.  I'm falling.  What's wrong with you?  I'm falling.  She's horrible.  You can't find a different colored shirt?  That's all you got is a black t-shirt.  Randy, you look fabulous, darling. 
[03:48:30]  You've been working out so much.  Yeah, well, I trimmed up a little bit, you know, a little tired.  Did you?  Me and the dog pound.  Well.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting more douche chills.  Wow.  Wow.  What a moment-ruiner he is.  Could you stop playing this and put on my Sam Kinison?  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Wow.  He, like, waits to the moment when the exact right time to say it.  Then he waits to the moment where it's so bad, it's funny. 
[03:49:00]  And then he waits to the moment.  It just doesn't even make sense.  It's like he's calling in long distance.  Holy cow.  Jesus.  This is on, like, TV in New York.  You actually, you want to hug him.  I wouldn't even tease him.  I would just hug him if I saw him.  You know there's a guy in, like, Iowa doing the weather, hoping he gets a shot at New York weather someday?  And this is the guy in the way.  And this is the dope that's sitting in the seat. 
[03:49:30]  Doing shtick.  Oh, wow.  Now, you know what's funny is the three of them will probably not even have a problem watching this tape at their Christmas party at the end of the year.  No, they'll all laugh.  Just laughing and high-fiving.  Yeah.  High-fiving.  This is the greatest thing ever.  Mike has to know, though.  He has to know he stinks.  He can't not know.  He's too nervous.  He's got to know that we make fun of him.  And I think that gets to his head.  Of course it does.  You can't wear the right...  Different kind of shirt.  You, like, change his midstream.  He trips up everything.  And this is every morning when they go to him and try to carry on a conversation about something to then segue into the weather. 
[03:50:00]  He cannot carry on a conversation about anything.  It's got to go to the weather.  And then when he finally goes, let's go to the temperatures.  You see, he physically goes, oh, God, okay.  I'm in my safe area.  Yeah, I'm in my safe zone.  I'm just giving numbers on a map.  56 on Long Island.  It's 58 in New York City.  He's comfortable.  But then she asks him something like, Mike, I see you're out there. 
[03:50:30]  Where are you?  I see a park behind you.  Park, park, bench.  Benches at the park.  Pidgey, good.  Back tee.  No ability to improv whatsoever.  We think it's more subtle.  We don't know.  But it makes us laugh every morning.  Every morning we tune in to him.  He's horrid.  Well, if you want to see really bad douche chills, I was on the Internet the other night  and I was looking up some obscure bands and somehow ended up coming across an album that 
[03:51:00]  Telly Savalas made.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard some of that.  It is really bad.  I looked up the Ted Heath Orchestra.  Why?  Because it was an album my dad had.  He had just weird, obscure stuff.  And I was thinking, do people actually have this stuff, right?  So I looked up that and I ended up getting on this site that just ended up having like,  it was a tribute to horrific albums.  Oh, Shatner on there, of course.  The Beatles Orchestra was like, they were like this big band out of England and they did 
[03:51:30]  all covers of Benny Goodman stuff and they sold a lot of records.  And then when rock music came in, they tried to do big band versions of like Beatles songs,  dude.  And it was horrific.  Horrifics.  But then what they did, they just had links to more horrific stuff.  And they went to like, you know, Boo Berry, Frankenberry, and Count Chocula did like a disco song.  It was unbelievable.  All right, we got to get this stuff.  Are you shitting me?  Sounds great.  Then Telly Savalas, who can't sing, admittedly can't sing. 
[03:52:00]  On the album cover, he or something says it in the liner.  It's all spoken word over music.  Yeah.  So he just talks.  Yeah, I don't want to ruin it.  Can you find it?  Because I don't want to.  I'm looking.  It's really bad.  I got a tape of the Dinah Shore show, Celebrities Sing.  And it's only clips of celebrities coming on and singing songs.  Like Herve Villachez was up there singing. 
[03:52:30]  Didn't he have a mustache?  Yeah.  Herve?  Yeah, what did he say?  Herve.  And one of them was Telly Savalas doing a song.  And it's just awful.  What did Herve sing?  I don't know.  That's right.  I said, hey, man, nice shot.  What a good shot.  Let's get that stuff on the show.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  Hey, uh. 
[03:53:00]  Completely changing gears because it's happening right as we speak.  Yes.  Thumbs up or down, Rachel Ray?  Uh, down.  I say down, too.  What is she?  Isn't Jay Moore?  What is she?  Rachel Ray?  I don't know.  What does she do?  She's the new, like, cooking chick on TV.  Jay Moore?  I don't know if he did our show.  Perhaps we could ask him.  He doesn't want to do our show anymore.  A little too early, maybe.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Um, he's aligned himself with another program.  Yeah.  Another show is, uh, Jay Moore's new favorite show to go on, and Jay Moore is a new friend 
[03:53:30]  of that show.  Uh.  A show that will remain nameless.  Nameless.  We won't acknowledge them anytime soon.  Nope.  No more kudos to that program.  Good luck, fuckos.  That's right.  Just for the record, I used to, as a reference, sort of let you know, I was ahead of the curve  on the Rachel Ray thing, and you guys, I got a car crash, I believe.  I got completely crashed. 
[03:54:00]  There you go.  Wait, for what?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Oh.  I'm just saying, I knew this bitch was going to be big.  That's all.  Well, she kind of is, around my hips.  I mean, that's what I don't get.  A lot of people think she's really hot.  It's actually, she's like, she's got like a pear body.  What is she doing?  A cooking show?  Yeah.  Or is this just a part of her show?  Oh, she is.  And her left boob is definitely smaller than her right.  Oh, fuck.  That's not good.  A lot smaller.  Well, uh.  Nah.  Yeah, that one right there, right? 
[03:54:30]  In general, women have a smaller boob.  One boob is slightly smaller because something to do with the heart pumping more blood to  that side of the chest.  Wait, I wait to see that look on your face again, Opie.  That is not.  That's the reason.  That cannot be the reason.  That's the reason girls have one boob larger than the other.  Well, sometimes.  One blood being pumped to that boob.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes it's the other boob.  That's the best part.  Watching Opie lose confidence in what he's.  Oh, you found it.  See, the reason is.  I got away with this for years, you fucker. 
[03:55:00]  I hate you.  I'm sorry, man.  You blow up everything.  You ruin everything that's good about this show.  Hey, you know.  That's a good job here.  YouTube.  Grab bag.  Celebrity music video crossovers.  Can we get some of this stuff for tomorrow?  Because we're running out of show today.  Where's Telly?  Is that it?  Was that the website?  You got Telly?  Oh, that could be good.  Where's Telly?  Oh, there it is.  That's the one.  That's Telly.  All right, let's get someone else for tomorrow.  Okay.  We'll do a little thing tomorrow.  God, we can't hear a little piece of it.  Of what?  Which one?  Telly?  That one right down there.  You got Telly?  Telly.  They're all horrific.  Bill's got Telly.  I have him on the Dinosaur show. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, okay.  Let's hear a little Telly.  Oh, no.  You want to hear the album.  This is long.  Telly Savalas.  It is the album.  He lip-synced.  The Hammer Dancer's Dream of Delight.  He couldn't even lip-sync.  We have a new album called, interestingly enough, Telly.  Telly.  And there's some beautiful moments in this album.  One of my particular likes is what Telly's going to do now.  It's called If.  Telly Savalas and his new album.  He lip-synced to this.  He couldn't even do his spoken words live. 
[03:56:00]  And he was all off because it's hard to do.  You're talking.  You're not singing to a rhythm.  Smallsy intro.  I love you, baby.  If a picture paints a thousand words...  Oh, is this the bread song, If?  Yeah.  Then why can't I paint you?  It just sucks. 
[03:56:30]  The words will never show.  How did they get away with this shit?  The you I've come to know.  David Caruso album.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And if a face...  And if a face...  Could launch a thousand ships...  Then where am I to go?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...  There's no one home.  But you... 
[03:57:00]  You're all that's left me too.  you keep anticipating  you start singing  and when  my love  back around  singing  for life is running dry  you come  you come and pour yourself  on me  who would fucking  play or buy this 
[03:57:30]  drivel  he said he goes  I can't make a mistake  because I'm not a singer  and they're like  why did they ask you to do this  and he goes  why did you do this  and he goes  because they asked me to  I couldn't get mad at that  turn down the money  I couldn't get mad at that  how are you going to fault them  here's a boatload of fucking cash  just talk your way through  these fucking popular songs  you got to hear them do the  is it the Isley Brothers  you never close your eyes anymore 
[03:58:00]  really  oh yeah  it's kind of relaxing  but it's not awful  because he's not singing  yeah  I want to hear the stopwatches  you got to hear the one  where he starts singing  yeah we'll try to find another one  we'll get some of these on tomorrow  let's get them on tomorrow  yeah  is he dead or no  he's dead  oh yeah  I'm dead baby  I caddied for him once  you could go into your kid  did you really  because that was part of the  kiddison impression  that's right  he uh  see  a little bit  you did get something

[04:09:00]  he had a funny line  and he fucked it  all up  it was  the first show  is Anthony's  kryptonite  which is true  I lose all power  to do anything  I have to leave  the situation  and he wrote that  or he said that  because apparently  that's what Travis wrote  and then he comes out  with that  first show  get your head  to leave  the thing  punch it out  you ass head  I hope you're as  embarrassed with your  call as I was 
[04:09:30]  during that whole  segment  douche  we didn't talk  about Travis's  picture from  10 years ago  it's adorable  we're gonna bring  that up  then we gotta  also bring up  Danny  why  did you know  that when  we got fired  from NEW  W and they were  doing a news story  on it  oh yeah  Danny was one  of our supporters  yeah there was  a little rally  with his Yoko Ono  glasses halfway down  and they were  interviewing people  in the crowd  and they put the mic  and Danny 
[04:10:00]  and there he was  sticking up for the show  good for him  and coming up  with probably  one of the most  original lines  to defend this program  that I've ever heard  tell you the truth  oh you got it  he has it as a ringtone  on his phone  he enjoys it so much  Sam this fucking  sadistic pox sucker  he loves torturing  anybody in this place  hold on  Travis is not off the hook  though  because when we came  back to radio  this proves you  the listener 
[04:10:30]  could work for this  show someday  yeah  we did our press  comment at the  Hard Rock Cafe  for XM  and I decided  it was such a great  day and moment  I'm taking pictures  from the stage  and I looked at  those pictures  about a year  a year ago  yeah  and there's Travis  as a fucking  serial killer  in the audience  just staring at us  on stage  everyone that fucking  works for us  was there  that day  Van was there  yeah  really?  yeah  I was there  but I brought  business cards  Van gave me  a business card  and I was like 
[04:11:00]  yeah I'll pass  this right along  boom  I just throw it  as garbage  but Travis  has the creepiest look  he's just staring  at us on the stage  from the audience  but then my brother  pushed you  said you were  a good shit  I just concentrated  on the shit part  at the beginning  and threw your card away  we got Danny though  we got Danny's thing  this is what he said  as they  they did like  an impromptu rally  we had nothing  to do with it  and I don't know  there weren't a lot  of people that showed up  but enough  and Danny was interviewed 
[04:11:30]  by Fox 5  and this is what he said  very original defense  for the show  thank you  it's just a sexist show  not at all  we're in  the ONA show  is an equal opportunity  offender  good lord  okay terrific  that's funny 
[04:12:00]  I'm funny  did you see that jerk  you dumb asshole

[04:13:00]  shut up  shut up  stop whining  quiet  so to speak  literally  I'm about to strangle you  out of your own consciousness  alright what else you got there  well  I was going to say  where it takes for nothing  really wow  did you notice right before 
[04:13:30]  surprise we had to take  two years off  I mean  can't understand it  right before he said  Opie and Anthony  he almost said  we're  equal opportunity  and then he stopped himself  and said  Opie  well  a little foreshadowing  there my friend  huh  it was either that  or he was going to kill  one of us  I have to change my shirt  I'm sweating  a lot of douche chills  for that evening  wow  we could all be honest  about that  alright  and Travis's picture  there's a picture  of Travis  um  that was sent  to me

[04:18:30]  on my cell phone  so you know  in an airport  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  over and over again  I'm there  over and over again  I'm with you  I could do it all day  don't even challenge me  they long over and over again and again at what point does the voice say okay this is the last  game that's a really good question there's never a last game that's the problem like i have to  fight it oh my god i'm aware that i'm doing it all right i gotta stop oh really i have to fight 
[04:19:00]  it i finally have to like try as i'm playing a game i'm trying to get my mind interested in  something else anything else so i could like go oh wait yeah i really need to pay the your vision  pay my rent yeah you know something and i went around all day like like where i can't move my  eyes without things spinning around from playing fucking uh the hell am i playing now i don't even  remember but a splinter cell double agent by the way we have segment to our after show meeting here 
[04:19:30]  this is just us battling this is wear a raincoat when you play it with a fedora yeah it's exactly  what i do how did you know i need help with a bit fedora the listeners could possibly help um  jimmy you go to starbucks a lot maybe you could help so i'm in starbucks for two hours and i was  listening to the crap they play over the loudspeaker and it's all women feeling strange about their  feelings and other women can relate because they're all know how to cry and fuck is that and 
[04:20:00]  and she has to go off and find herself type music what isn't it xm yeah yeah it is xm yeah oh xm  that's crappy you're talking about is xm god forbid we say xm actually has crappy channels too yes we  all know that the tampon channel but i want to get a list of these songs together because when you  really start listening to lyrics of some of these songs it's ridiculous well can we get that off of  relationships breaking up and one person understanding that the other person has to 
[04:20:30]  go find themselves oh man stop it's like no man they they get the hatchet didn't work out  come around to the hatchet but i'm on to something but it's not quite there so i need maybe people to  maybe call in tomorrow with suggestions of of songs that kind of follow that uh criteria  because they're ridiculous when you start listening to these songs  are hatchets made in sweatshops and if they are why wouldn't you just kill your boss  yeah they have to be happy employees at the hatchet factory like how bad are the rest of the 
[04:21:00]  people because at this point everything is made like fucking taiwan you know they're not paying  them yeah beating them with with like a wet dress shirt that they just sewed together so i think a  lot of hatchets probably made in china you'd probably make 25 an hour if you're making hatchets  that's probably a job keep the employees happy they actually do hit each other in the eye with  them and just no one notices maybe one last people in the room oh his eyes have shot  all right let's go yeah out out tim z open we're not part of regular radio you fuckhead
