<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie solo, due to Anthony's severe illness.  Listeners flooded the show with calls and faxes, expressing both concern and, in some cases, mocking Anthony's condition. Opie mentioned Stephen Lynch's controversial appearance the previous day, highlighting a song so problematic it would never be played again.  Ralph Ditorre filled in as co-host for portions of the show.  A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to listener requests for classic Opie and Anthony bits, including  "100 grand," "Tourette's Whorehouse," "Old Bill crossing the street," "The Duck Job," "The Gerbil Song," and the now-unavailable "Priest Song."

Throughout the show, frequent phone calls connected Opie with a progressively worse Anthony, detailing his self-medication with various cold remedies.  Musical discussion included Metallica's upcoming performance with the San Francisco Symphony and banter about other artists and songs.  A Priceline.com advertisement was read, featuring a heavily medicated Anthony. Opie shared an anecdote about a three-flusher toilet malfunction at his sister-in-law's birthday party.  The hosts teased a Super Bowl prank call to a funeral home for later in the broadcast.

Other segments included discussion of the Mike Brady bit (Anthony's theory about Mike Brady's secret activities under the stairs), a crude Popeye bit incorporating the word "pusky," and Anthony's delirious commentary, fueled by cold medicine, on various TV shows and commercials.  The show promoted a Super Bowl contest offering a Sony Web TV and a Miami trip as prizes, and touched upon the topic of cable modem speeds.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  U-2 playing with Bruce Braysteen and Willie Nelson.  April 6th, Hammerstein Ballroom.  Ticket info to come right here at NEW.  That's the tribute to Johnny Cash that they are putting together.  Good afternoon, it's Opie, Flying Solo.  My buddy, my pal, who sits across from me, is home very, very sick.  If you're a faithful listener to the show, you probably heard it in his voice yesterday.  Funniest man alive, had to take a day off on me. 
[00:00:30]  And a lot of people are faxing in Anthony, because I know Anthony's listening.  We're going to call him once an hour to see how he's doing.  But Hoover writes, tell Anthony to have some Trania.  It'll straighten him right up.  And this one's really good from Johnny.  You know, it's never safe around the Opie and Anthony show.  Even when we're down and out and sick, you guys will still abuse us.  That's what we like about you guys.  Because I'm suffering from a fever myself here.  But Johnny writes, hey, Ope, tell Ake to take off his skirt and get back to work. 
[00:01:00]  Ask him if he's wearing feety pajamas.  Ask him, did Snooki, a.k.a. the wife, rub Vicks on his chest and pillow?  I hated when my mom did this.  Did Ake take his temperature rectally?  And by the way, play the 100 grand call.  We are going to play your favorite Opie and Anthony bits today, by the way.  If you want to give us a call, Rick's working the phones.  212-757-1027.  But I'll put this aside and we'll ask Anthony all these fine questions, Johnny.  So thanks for checking in.  Well, if you were listening yesterday, we had our buddy, our pal, Stephen Lynch. 
[00:01:30]  He's going to be huge.  I'm telling you right now, he's going to be just incredibly big.  And he came in to do some songs.  And I think I can play this one.  1027-WNAW, the rock of New York, Metallica.  From Garage Inc., turn the page.  It's Opie playing solo today.  Anthony, a very, very sick man.  We're going to be checking in with him in a little bit.  We'll bust his balls.  We're going to call him every hour today, even though he's trying to get some rashes. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, that's it.  And in the studio helping me out today.  Because I'm just not used to doing a radio show by myself.  It's been many, many years.  And it's kind of strange being in.  Ralph, I don't know how you do it.  By yourself?  Yeah, Ralph's in here by himself.  And he just stares at a blank wall and acts like he's talking to you guys, the listeners.  I get the privilege of at least talking to Anthony.  You know what I mean?  It's the old theater of the mind.  I get to use it all the time.  Yeah, but, you know, if you're at home right now, try to talk to yourself and make believe you're having a conversation with someone.  It's not easy to do. 
[00:02:30]  I got the phone calls, though.  People, lots of nice people on the phones.  You're happy.  So that helps.  All right.  What do you got on Metallica?  Because you're the music man.  Ralph knows everything.  I listen to your show and I get scared.  What do you know about all these bands?  What do you got on Metallica?  Give me anything.  They're playing in San Francisco with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in the middle of April, something like that.  They're going to record it.  If it comes out good, they're going to put it out.  If it doesn't, bootlegs.  Bootlegs for everyone.  Do you think there's going to be a mosh pit there? 
[00:03:00]  Can you imagine?  They were talking about they'll come out in black tie and make the orchestra wear black leather.  Yeah.  At least Michael Kamen should come out in black leather.  He's going to be conducting.  Very good.  Yeah.  All right.  Also today on the show, you could request your favorite Opie and Anthony bits.  We'd like to do this from time to time.  It's a perfect day considering half the team's not here.  Do you got a favorite Opie and Anthony bits?  You got anything by Yoshi.  You want to hear some Yoshi?  Like the guys on the phone.  Hey, I'll hear anything by that band.  Yeah.  Anything by Yoshi.  Anything by Yoshi?  Okay.  Rick, what are they requesting so far? 
[00:03:30]  All right.  So far, let's see.  Three requests for the 100 grand.  Mm-hmm.  We've got a few requests for the Tourette's Whorehouse call off the Demented World.  Okay.  Lullaby.  Stephen Lynch.  Yes, very good.  Old Bill.  Old Bill crossing the street.  Crossing the street.  Okay.  Bunch of requests for that.  All right.  The Duck Job.  All right.  Donald Duck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Gerbil Song, another Stephen Lynch favorite.  Okay.  And a new one to the list.  What?  I expect the area to run down here any moment.  The Priest Song. 
[00:04:00]  You know, didn't they erase that?  I mean, isn't that like out of the studio altogether?  Yeah, we don't have a copy of that anymore.  See, there are things we do on our show that we will only do once, so it's good to boot,  you know, tape the show from time to time.  If you've got a copy of the Priest Song, you've got a very special moment from the Opie and Anthony  show.  Make your own bootlegs.  Yeah, so you can make your own bootleg and pass it around on the internet or whatever.  Well, we can play the 100 grand call real fast.  We get so many calls for this damn thing.  It's a track off for a Demented World CD.  You ever hear this, Ralph?  I'm not sure. 
[00:04:30]  Is this when you call somebody and tell them they won 100 grand?  Well, no, it went on the radio and just said that we were going to give away 100 grand.  Never said money, just said 100 grand, giving away 100 grand, coming up next hour, 100  grand.  You're giving away...  No.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Guns N' Roses, Paradise City, and Matchbox 20 before  that with Long Day.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  And Anthony.  There he is.  Hi.  And Ralph the Tour is sitting in trying to help me out a little bit, Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  How are you?  Thanks, Ralph.  No problem, man.  That's mighty mighty.  I can't sit in your chair, though.  I'm the next one over.  I wouldn't use that mic anyway.  Infected.  That's one of the reasons.  Bubonic Plague.  Yeah, Anthony, it's kind of strange.  It's like no one is sitting in your seat.  Your microphone is just kind of hanging there.  It's infected.  Did you ever see the Leonard Skinner tribute band?  That's what it's like.  They play Freebird just for the mic.  Yeah, there's a spotlight on your microphone.  There's just a spotlight on your microphone, and your Sam Adams hat is just kind of hanging 
[00:05:30]  from the microphone.  I've done it.  We've got a laptop set up, too.  Yeah, we've got just...  Yeah, it's a fake laptop, but...  In memoriam.  It's almost like you're there.  It's kind of strange.  There's your little bell.  Great.  Thank you.  So how are you feeling, man?  Oh, good.  Rocky Balboa just beat the crap out of Clubber Lang.  Yeah, okay.  I could buy 25 Beanie Babies that are sure to go up in value.  And Judge Judy is really pissed. 
[00:06:00]  So my day is just great.  And there's no Brady Bunch reruns on?  No.  What's on Nickelodeon?  Nickelodeon's got some stupid cartoon like Doug on or something.  Yeah.  Hey, I like Doug.  It's a fag cartoon.  Yeah, Doug blows.  I never said I was hip.  You've got a Warner Brothers cartoon where they hit each other with sledgehammers.  Of course.  Oh, how are you holding up there?  Hold down the fort?  Barely.  I'm just not used to doing a radio show by myself. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of strange.  Oh, Johnny sent the facts.  I've got to ask you a couple questions.  All right.  Hey, Ak, take off your skirt and get back to work.  Ask.  Ask him if he's wearing feety pajamas.  No, actually, I'm in the sweats.  Okay.  Yeah.  Did Snooki, aka The Wife, rub Vicks on your chest and pillow?  No, Vicks.  I hate that stuff.  All right.  He said he hated when his mom did that to him.  Yeah.  And everyone wants to know if you took your temperature rectally. 
[00:07:00]  You're a dirty boy.  I'm a dirty boy.  I can't even do any voices.  It just blows, man.  It just blows.  Well, that's why we're having the listeners call up with their favorite opiate Anthony bits,  and we're going to play some of them today.  All right.  This Theraflu is like heroin.  Is it really?  Oh, my God.  They should just give you works with it. 
[00:07:30]  Like, tie off, boot up.  Just mainline the stuff.  Oh, I'm a mess.  All right.  Well, can you stick around for the price line read, Ant?  I wouldn't have it any other way.  You're going to try it?  Captain Kirk with Larry Johnson.  Oh, God.  This is bad.  All the characters called in sick today, too.  It's just strange when that happens.  It's like, okay, well, Anthony's sick, but at least, you know, Yoshi's not sick, and Dice won't be sick,  and William Shatner, and everyone called in sick.  It's kind of strange. 
[00:08:00]  I don't get that.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  All right.  Well, stick around and do the price line read with me.  Okay.  And everyone is requesting the Popeye bit.  We're going to play one of them today.  Oh, I'll get to hear what I used to sound like.  Yeah.  I think we'll play the one from Tuesday, late in the show.  All right, Anthony, you still there?  Anthony.  What?  Anthony.  Turn down your radio.  We're in delay.  Hello?  Anthony.  Oh, I'll be. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Anthony.  What do I...  Oh, oh, the...  Oh.  Delay, delay.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi.  Long time listener, first time caller.  It must be the NyQuil.  Turn down your radio.  You ass.  That's me.  That old gag.  That old ploy.  That old ruse.  All right, it's Priceline.com, Anthony.  Oh, I wish Priceline had, like, voice boxes.  If I could name my own price for a new voice box.  That would be nice. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Well, you can name your own price for a hotel room.  Huh?  But you're not going to be going away in the near future, are you, Anthony?  No, I have my own little hotel room set up here.  Yes, okay.  Well, if you're going away in the near future, you need a hotel room, you need a flight, give  Priceline.com a call, 1-800-Priceline, and they will match your price.  You call them, you tell them, I want to pay this much for a damn hotel room, and they  get back to you, and they take care of you.  Why wouldn't you take advantage of this?  And if you use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night, Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, great.  I'll use it tonight.  Yeah.  Sure you will.  So, if you're on the internet, give Priceline.com a try, www.priceline.com, or you can give  them a call, 1-800-Priceline, all right?  All right.  Anything else to say about Priceline, Anthony, or?  No, not right now.  I have to medicate.  All right.  I need more dope.  What's the next medication you're going to put into your system?  Well, what time is it?  Let's see, 425.  I think I have to take some aerobitussin. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that should be fun.  And then, yeah, I'm coming up on having to take some more Theraflu.  Oof.  Are you mixing your cold medicines?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I am mixing, matching.  I'm having some kind of reaction where I'm growing fins, I think, at this point.  Are you making your own version of the Long Island iced tea?  Yeah, with over-the-counter drugs.  Yeah, right on, man.  All right, we're going to check in with you, 515.  I'll be listening.  Because everyone really cares about you.  I bet.  I've heard the faxes that you've been reading. 
[00:10:30]  They just want to abuse you so badly.  I know.  All right, man.  Give me a break.  Hang in there, all right?  All right.  All right.  It's after that, everyone.  Buddy's man alive.  Sick home.  Home sick, I should say.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Bad Company.  With Bad Company.  Off the CD.  Bad Company.  Very nice.  Very original.  It's Opie and Ralph Datorre hanging with me for a little while.  Hello there.  I think he's going to be bailing out.  I see you've got your train schedule in front of you.  Yeah, I took the train schedule out. 
[00:11:00]  You know, honey, I won't be on the 404.  Okay.  I don't know.  I'm looking at where I'm going to go now.  I'll figure it out later.  You should do the whole show with me today.  I'm shorthanded.  Yeah.  I'll call Mrs. T, see if she's got any plans for me today.  Okay.  And if I don't have to be anywhere at any specific time.  Now the Super Bowl winning starts tomorrow, huh?  I'm very excited about that.  Now, I don't pay attention in the meetings around here, so what's going on with that?  They tell people to call.  Yeah.  They call.  Okay.  They win a web TV.  Okay. 
[00:11:30]  From Sony.  All right.  All right.  And then they'll be in the drawing for the trip to Miami?  Right.  Wow.  So you win a web TV to start, which is great.  Okay.  And then if you get the grand prize, boom, you're in Miami.  And we're doing this all weekend long?  Mm-hmm.  Starting tomorrow with Steve Mason?  Absolutely.  At 9 a.m., I would assume, somewhere around there?  It's a good ballpark.  Well, actually, it gets off the air at 9, so.  What?  He does.  Hummer Queen?  Okay.  So keep listening for details.  Is she on Priceline now? 
[00:12:00]  Hummer Queen?  Yeah.  No?  Okay.  Name your own price for a Hummer?  Now, that's what I want to see Priceline.com get into.  Well, they do the flights, right?  Yeah.  They do the hotel rooms.  They're doing mortgages now.  They're doing mortgages now.  Home equity, all kinds of stuff.  Name your own price for a Hummer.  Now, that's a commercial we could really support.  We don't want the people from Priceline.com mad at us.  They know we're just teasing.  We love those guys.  All right. 
[00:12:30]  Anthony, homesick.  We're going to be talking to him again.  But we are playing your favorite Opie and Anthony Bits today.  If you got one, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Or you could fax us.  212-957-WNEW.  We're going to play another song from Stephen Lynch.  He was in yesterday with a whole batch of brand new songs.  One of them got us in a lot of trouble.  If you got the pre-song, you got gold in your hand because you'll never hear that again.  Every once in a while, you'll tune in our show and you'll hear something once. 
[00:13:00]  That's one of those that you'll never hear again.  So, you got a bootleg.  You got something special in your hands, okay?  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York.  The latest from Collective Soul off their CD dosage.  That is a run.  You could also find that off the Varsity Blues soundtrack.  Those guys sounded great on Ralph the Torres Show the other day.  I think they're coming to town soon.  We'll have some dates for you.  If you've never seen Collective Soul in concert, check them out.  They're very, very good.  It's Opie flying solo today.  Very strange.  I'm sitting here in the studio by myself. 
[00:13:30]  Ralph the Torres was helping me out for a little while, but he went upstairs to take a crunch.  Is he coming back?  No, we'll find out how his crunch was.  Come on, Ralph.  Come on, Ralph.  Doesn't even know we were talking about his crunch.  How was it?  That was what?  Your crunch.  Oh, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got to tell you a story.  All right, go ahead.  You know, last night, that was my sister-in-law's birthday.  Uh-huh.  And she took us all out for Mexican food for her birthday. 
[00:14:00]  Happy belated birthday, Auntie.  And, you know, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food for obvious reasons.  Yeah.  You've heard of a two-flusher, right?  Yeah.  That's when it doesn't all go down the first time?  Uh-huh.  This was a three-flusher.  You had the green apple splatters?  You know, the funny part is, you know, we have the co-ed bathroom here on this level.  I went upstairs.  Well, you're relatively new to NAW.  You know what that bathroom's all about right there, right?  The co-ed bathroom?  Yeah.  No, I don't.  What?  You're not allowed to crunch in that bathroom. 
[00:14:30]  Well, I never have.  Okay.  All right.  So my conscience is clear.  All right, because when Anthony and I had Willie Nelson in, in the imaginary ballroom,  one of, like, the tech guys, he crunched in that bathroom, and the smell was brutal.  That's not fair.  So that room is just for just kind of taking a quick leap.  But stinking up upstairs is okay.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah, because that's a sales area.  Who cares about them?  Who else goes up in there?  Everybody.  Wins?  Yeah.  Everybody crunches upstairs.  You're not allowed to crunch in that bathroom outside the studio. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I feel sorry there's tile falling off the wall.  I feel sorry for whoever goes in there next.  Really?  Right on, man.  All right, we're hanging.  We're doing, like, the best of Opie and Anthony today, because Anthony's homesick.  We're going to get him on the phone in a little bit.  He'll be incoherent.  It's fun, though.  Mainline of NyQuil.  Yeah, because every time we call him, he just gets more and more out of it.  It's kind of fun to just listen to him.  So on the way, we're going to play the Popeye bit, talking about Pusky.  And I think I'm going to break one out from the archives.  Because the Super Bowl is around the corner. 
[00:15:30]  We did a couple of Super Bowl pranks that are really funny that no one has ever heard.  We've got to give the people some new material today.  So we called a funeral parlor and said that someone in our family died, and it was their  dream to watch the Super Bowl, and, you know, we needed him to come over and prop the body  up so he could watch the game.  You've got to stick around and hear this.  I'll break one out of the archives that you're not going to believe.  All right?  But right now, we're getting a lot of requests for our old bits and a bunch of calls for the  Mike Brady bit. 
[00:16:00]  Did you hear the Mike Brady bit?  Refresh my memory.  Okay, Anthony was convinced that Mike Brady spent a lot of his time under the stairs at  the Brady Bunch house, because you could see right through the stairs.  No, I missed this.  So Anthony was convinced that Mike Brady was a dirty boy.  He's a dirty boy.  It just sounds like it.  So he thought, you know, he spent the time just looking at the girls go up and down the  stairs.  The Rack of New York, 1027 WNEW, Thin Lizzy, Jailbreak, and the latest from Everlast.  Before that, what it's like from the CD, Whitey Ford Sings the Blues. 
[00:16:30]  Ralph, have you heard the rest of that album yet?  Pits and Pieces, yeah.  Is it as good as that song, or?  It's a little more up-tempo.  Is it?  Well, isn't he the lead singer of one of those, who was he the lead singer of?  Maybe one of our listeners could help us out.  Like a hardcore metal band or something.  Yeah, kind of thrashy.  A thrash band.  Well, it's Ope Flying Solo, my buddy, my pal, my partner in crime.  How you doing?  Is on the phone.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Anthony is sick at home. 
[00:17:00]  It's just, wait a minute, I've got to take my little medicine here, wait a minute.  How's the pain, by the way?  That's right.  That stuff is horrible.  What are you taking this hour?  More Robitussin.  Oof, yeah.  The quill's not working for you?  I can't take the quill till later.  Why?  I'd pass out.  That stuff knocks you out.  Yeah, but the listeners want you to do the quill and then try to do the show with me.  Yeah, good luck.  Maybe I'll do that for the next break. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  I'll take some quill.  All right, what's on TV?  Anything good?  Well, I was just watching CBS News, and they had a great call on tape of some cops beating the  crap out of some guy.  That's always fun.  Yeah.  Other than that, boy, there is nothing on television.  This just sucks.  I've got to get back in there.  Well, don't you have the Cartoon Network?  They play crap.  What do you mean?  With the good cartoons.  Well, what cartoon are they playing?  I don't know, some of that new stuff where, like, the whole body is stiff and just the  mouth moves. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's a lousy animation.  Not the best animation in the world.  Oh, it's terrible.  Well, Anthony, I got the Popeye bit all queued up here.  Oh.  This is what started you down the road to sickness, I believe.  You think this is what ruined my throat?  Yeah, because you hinted that in the middle of this Popeye thing.  I was feeling a little scratchy that day.  Yes.  Well, it all started when I asked Popeye if he was a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer  Club.  Right.  And Popeye went off. 
[00:18:30]  Olive's is pretty good with me, member.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What does olives and a submarine have in common?  Um.  What, Popeye?  They're both full of semen.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  That's an old nautical joke.  Oh.  I tell it while I'm on the boats.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  This is Pusky.  Oh, Pusky.  It looks like the sea hag.  Ellis, eat a burger, for Christ's sake. 
[00:20:00]  I can't even grab your ass.  You ain't gots gonna ask.  Oh, Ellis, how about a little hygiene?  I'm a sailor man.  I know what low tide smells like.  Something ensernating from the Pusky. 
[00:20:30]  Where's Wimpy?  Oh, yeah, you think Wimpy's a homo, right?  Wimpy's a flameskin, homes go sexual.  Always lookskin' for free meat. 
[00:21:00]  That's right.  Now I'll open the cans of spinach and makes me member grow.  I keep doing this.  I'm not gonna be able to talk tomorrow.  You haven't noticed I have a sore throat.  All right, well, I guess Popeye is a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[00:21:30]  Of course.  That's something everyone wanted to know today.  But I have to reciprocate.  Sometimes I burn Olive's Pusky with my pipe.  Because I never takes it out of me mouth.  Why do you think that one eye pops out?  It's the fumes. 
[00:22:00]  Olive does a great trick with her Pusky.  Yeah, what is that?  Watch, watch.  Come here, Olive.  Let me take me pipes out of me mouth.  Put it here.  Down by the Pusky.  Okay, go, Olive.  Look, she blows the pipe.  It's a magical Pusky.  You can't say that word on the radio, man.  Pusky, Pusky, Pusky.  Come on. 
[00:22:30]  I never heard any rules against the word Pusky.  Wow, right.  All right.  Well, I guess we got the answer to our question. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm a Chatska member.  And there you have it from Tuesday night, man.  Anthony, you still there?  Oh.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Hey.  You still there?  Yeah.  There's a piece of you in your better days, man.  All right.  All right.  We'll check in with you at 6, right?  You do that.  A little after 6?  All right, man.  All right.  I hope you feel better. 
[00:23:30]  So do I.  Okay.  All right.  Later, bro.  Later.  On the way, we got Jane's Addiction, The Who, the new band, Indigenous, and we got the  answer to our question.  The lead singer of Everlast was from House of Pain.  That's right.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW with The Who and the band, Indigenous, before that, Now  That You're Gone.  It's Opie flying solo today.  Not feeling that great myself, but I'm feeling much better than Anthony.  If you've been listening to the radio, he's very sick at home.  I think you started this sickness, Ralph. 
[00:24:00]  Ralph, the tour, is sitting in today helping us out.  I was somewhere in the middle.  I still got it, actually.  Well, someone started the sickness around here.  You want to blame Carol?  Well, Carol's been out for three or four days now.  Matt Devote's been sick.  You had it for a while.  Anthony's got it.  Roger in marketing's got it.  We're running around disinfecting the studio all the time.  Well, look what I brought in here.  I feel like Howard Hughes, man.  I got my hand soap.  The antibacterial stuff that just kind of disappears.  Yep.  And I got the heavy-duty Lysol.  Do it in the mic.  No, put it in the mic. 
[00:24:30]  Don't spray me.  I'm spraying it at you, man.  What?  Drusty.  Yeah, but it's going to keep us healthy, hopefully.  Got to keep the germs out of here.  It sprays so much I can taste it.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  It's funny.  Anthony usually sits over there.  And we said this earlier.  We got his whole microphone set up.  And if you ever saw the Leonard Skinner tribute show, everyone saw that, right?  We just need a spotlight.  Yeah.  Now, what was the brother?  What was his name again?  Not the one that died. 
[00:25:00]  The one that took over for...  Johnny Van Zandt.  Johnny Van Zandt took over.  Took over for Ronnie Van Zandt.  For Ronnie, right.  Well, Johnny sings all the Leonard Skinner songs.  Every single one of them, except one.  And then at the end of the show, they say there's only one guy that can sing this next song.  And he's no longer with us.  They do Free Bird.  And they do Free Bird instrumentally.  And they have a spotlight on the mic stand.  And they just do an instrumental version of the song.  You get goosebumps.  First time I saw that, it freaked me out.  Anyway, with that said, that's what we got happening over here with Anthony's microphone. 
[00:25:30]  We got like a cheap laptop set up because Anthony brought his home.  We got his microphone with a Sam Adams hat just kind of draped over the microphone.  And a spotlight just waiting for his return, which might be tomorrow.  He's just sick.  He's not gone.  No, he's not gone.  Come on.  No, but, you know.  He set up that image.  No, no, he's not gone.  I just hope I'm in here tomorrow with him.  That'll be funny.  I'll be sick tomorrow and he'll be here.  So, Stephen Lynch was in yesterday once again.  And if you got a copy of the pre-song, consider yourself lucky because we can't play that ever, 
[00:26:00]  ever, ever again.  That's a go-in.  There's about 10 bits we've done here in New York that we can never, ever, ever play again.  And that's one of them.  So, if you got a copy, you know, consider yourself special.  But I think we're allowed to play this one again.  The kitten song?  Which one is it?  He sang a song about kittens?  Yeah.  A cute little ditty about kittens.  Is it anti-cats?  Oh, I don't think so.  Because I'm not a big fan.  No.  Myself.  Personally, I think Stephen Lynch loves cats, Ralph. 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  You can tell by this song.  Oh, it's here.  All right.  Also, on the way, we're going to break out a bit from the archives that you've never,  ever heard.  All right?  It's a Super Bowl prank we did because we're giving away that trip to the Super Bowl.  Mm-hmm.  Starting tomorrow.  It's unbelievable.  1027 WNNW, The Rock of New York, Billy Idol, White Wedding.  And the wedding singer making Billy Idol pretty huge these days.  Had that fine cameo on the airplane with Adam Sandler.  Quadrafinia helped, too.  Who?  Quadrafinia. 
[00:27:00]  Quadrafinia, that's right.  What is he doing with Quadrafinia?  He was the bellboy.  The bellboy, that's right.  Bellboy.  Got Ralph Dettore in the studio helping me out.  Anthony, home.  I'm having a fun time.  Homesick.  It's cool.  I feel like it's bringing a kid to work day, and I'm the kid.  You're supervising me.  You're making sure I don't cross the line today.  No, I think you're taking care of that yourself.  We're doing okay.  Especially yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  Yikes.  You think that's why he's pretending he's sick?  Anthony? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he's scared to come in.  Well, I told Anthony earlier when I talked to him at 320 that he picked a perfect day not  to come in today because the boss, Gary, had a stack of messages from people that were  complaining about yesterday's show.  So I had to take the heat by myself today.  It wasn't fun.  I feel sorry for you.  Well, the boss had to spend two, two and a half hours just calling back all these people  that complained about our show yesterday.  Well, you didn't know.  Well, Stephen Lynch was in, and he sung a song about a priest. 
[00:28:00]  A nasty song.  That is going to get a lot of people in a lot of trouble.  Yikes.  I think we survived this one.  All right.  Well, we got the Super Bowl trip.  We're going to start doing that tomorrow, Ralph.  Absolutely.  We don't know exactly when the winning starts.  It's not on my little sheet here.  But all weekend long, you got that chance to win the trip to go to Miami for the Super  Bowl.  And you qualify by winning a Sony Web TV courtesy of the Bud Bowl.  Yeah, that's pretty neat.  And then you got your chance to go to the game.  Now, what was Anthony talking about yesterday with this whole modem thing he's got? 
[00:28:30]  The cable modem?  The cable modem, yeah.  That's not for Web TV.  That's for an actual just regular computer, right?  Just to be faster and things?  I believe you could use the cable modem for both.  Your TV and Web TV and the computer.  Yeah, I got to admit, I don't know what it's all about, so.  You don't know what a cable modem is all about?  No, I don't.  Seriously?  No, seriously.  Well, do you have the Internet at home?  You don't have a computer at home, Ralph?  It's $19.99.  You know what the deal is?  I have one of the original. 
[00:29:00]  I have a 386, which is a doorstop now.  Oof.  You know, I bought a computer, whatever, 10 years ago.  Yeah.  And never updated.  Oh, you've got to get into the 90s.  Yeah, no, it's a joke.  It is.  The cable modem, I mean, you use the computers around here.  Yeah, no, I mean, I'm computer savvy.  All right, so, all right, here's the deal.  When you go to a website, all right, with the station computers, it takes a while for your page to load, right?  Yeah, especially Pedro out of here, this one.  Exactly, so you go to the WNEW website, and you have to wait for the home page to pop up. 
[00:29:30]  With a cable modem, it's instant.  I like that.  You want to, you know.  It's a gratification.  Yeah, you type in an address, and poof, it's there.  It is so fast.  That's a beautiful thing.  Are we going to get them here?  Are they available?  You have to wait?  What's the deal?  The funny thing is, we've got the T1 lines here, and the T1 lines are really, really fast, but the cable modem makes the T1 lines look silly.  And that's just the, you know, the way of the future right there.  I'll just get it all at once.  You should?  Yeah, they'll come, they'll drive a big truck to the house, and just, boom. 
[00:30:00]  And set yourself up?  I'll be ready, and then you'll never see me again.  All right, so we've got the trip for the Super Bowl.  All weekend long, you get a chance to qualify by winning the Sony Web TV, courtesy of the Bud Bowl.  And then, I believe, if it works like other things we've done around here, Steve Mason, on Monday, will take all the weekend winners and pick a grand prize winner for the trip.  Who do you think you're going to win the Bud Bowl this year?  Who cares?  Who cares?  That is so dumb.  Don't say, they're giving us only sweat TVs to give away.  You say, who cares?  I happen to like Bud.  Anthony loves Bud.  I love Bud.  I like Bud Dry, but they don't make it anymore. 
[00:30:30]  I didn't even know they were doing the Bud Bowl this year.  They are?  They always do.  You know they're doing a seven-hour pregame for the Super Bowl this year?  Why?  I don't know.  Last year, it was two hours and 40 minutes.  This year, it's seven hours long.  Who do they think they are?  Clinton?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, those bitches.  Don't even get me started with that.  Okay.  But speaking of the Super Bowl, I broke out a bit from the Opie and Anthony archives.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York with Train.  That's a song called Free.  It's Opie hanging with Ralph Dutore today.  Anthony taking a sick day.  I know.  He'll hopefully be back with moi tomorrow. 
[00:31:00]  I like that tune.  For FU Friday.  Yeah, it has like a southern feel to it, right?  Absolutely.  Sounds like Marshall Tucker a little bit.  Yeah.  Just a tiny bit.  I got that same thing the first time I heard it, but they're from Frisco.  They're from Frisco?  Yeah, from Frisco.  They sound like they should be from down south a little bit.  San Francisco.  Southern fried rock, you know?  Maybe the vocalist is.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  We've got to find out more.  We'll get them here.  Bring them to town.  You had Collective Soul this week.  That was fun.  Those guys are really, really cool.  They're very shy.  Yeah.  I warned you, didn't I?  You're really shy, man.  I warned you, Ed.  Like, so Ed. 
[00:31:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, Ed, the lead singer.  Yes.  Doesn't like to really talk.  Yes, that's true.  He doesn't have an attitude, though.  No, not at all.  He just is really shy.  But that's, you know, an interviewer's nightmare.  Mm-hmm.  You get yes and no answers.  I was like, no, come on, talk.  Yeah, yeah.  Say something.  Because you sit there and you...  Run out of questions.  Yeah.  And you do your research and you ask us some nice questions and you get, yeah, I guess.  No, it just looked good.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's their touring plans, Collective Soul?  Because I really like those guys a lot.  Well, I think March, he said March 6th, they're playing somewhere in either Canada or New England. 
[00:32:00]  But when are they going to be down here in New York?  They don't know.  They said sometime before the end of the year.  Okay.  They'll be playing in New York.  All right.  So, that's a pretty big space.  Cool.  Well, I want to thank Ralph for hanging with me today.  My pleasure.  Because I used to do radio by myself and it kind of got...  That was a long time ago.  That was a long time ago.  I haven't done solo radio in four years and now I don't know how people do it.  I don't know how, Ralph, you sit here.  You're on from 12 to 3.  Yeah.  You sit here.  You stare at that wall and you act like... 
[00:32:30]  I hardly stare at the wall.  Well, you know what I mean.  You're looking around and you're getting your show together, but...  You know, you're feeding the fantasy that everybody thinks a DJ just sits around and plays  music.  You know, Ralph works his butt off.  And listens to music, you know.  Yeah.  I don't sit around and, you know, read the paper.  But what I'm trying to explain to the people listening right now, it's not easy just to  be in a room by yourself with a microphone on and talk to imaginary people.  See, when Anthony and I do the show, we can interact with each other.  Yeah.  But when you're a jock by yourself in a room, it's kind of strange.  You don't know who you're really talking to.  Absolutely. 
[00:33:00]  And you don't have that feedback and you can play off anybody.  There's nobody to play off of.  And that's why I begged you to stay with me today because I just can't imagine doing  it anyway.  It has been too long.  Yeah.  You know?  This is fun for me too.  Cool.  I like doing this.  And you're helping me out with my music knowledge, which is...  Yeah, you're pretty good.  Which I need help on.  Especially these bands like Tree.  But we've been asking everyone to call in with their favorite Opie and Anthony bits.  Taking a trip down memory lane today.  And we had a bunch of calls for some of the telemarketer calls we've done in the past. 
[00:33:30]  What are these?  Do you listen to our show, Ralph?  Occasionally.  I feel like we shouldn't even be playing these bits because we've played them so much.  But now that...  I've missed quite a few, I'm sure.  Obviously.  Well, at home, I'm very bored before the show.  And the telemarketers, we all hate telemarketers, right?  They call it the wrong time.  You're trying to...  Usually during dinner.  Usually during dinner or whatever.  Just at the worst time.  You can't get them off the phone.  And you beg to get off their list.  And they keep harassing you.  So I turn the tide.  And I mess with them now.  And I record them at home. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  Allman Brothers.  Statesboro Blues.  And NEW proudly presents the Allman Brothers band at the Beacon March 4th.  Yeah.  And 11th.  In addition, NEW presents Johnny Lang at the Hammerstein Ballroom March 10th.  We've got to get him into the imaginary ballroom once again.  You know, it's a good thing you didn't become a musician.  What?  By the way.  Anthony makes fun of that all the time.  Spazzo drumming.  What was that?  I used to be a drummer.  Corky on drums, man.  I was drumming along pretty well.  You should hear me sing. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, God, no.  Anthony's trying to record me singing.  Because when the songs are playing, I just start screaming and singing along thinking I sound good.  And you should see everyone's faces in here.  I can imagine.  It's like when you blow the dog whistle and the dog's head kind of turns sideways and stuff.  That's the face Anthony makes as I'm singing.  I'm like, what?  I'm just singing along, having fun here.  Oh, we got Anthony on the line?  Is he on the line?  Is he totally nonsensical here?  Anthony.  Hey.  What's up? 
[00:35:00]  It's kicking in, huh?  Huh?  Is it kicking in?  It's like...  Is that...  Yeah, it's like...  He's there.  I took the quill.  I'm very fuzzy.  Oh, you took the quill.  Right about now.  I took the NyQuil.  Okay.  Have you eaten anything today other than liquid medicine?  No, that's it.  Just drugs.  Over-the-counter drugs, man.  You combine these things right, you don't need crack.  That's great.  You just got to get the right formula.  Now, what is the right formula? 
[00:35:30]  I'm sure of you.  You need a couple of Thera-Flu tablets.  Okay.  And then you need some Robitussin.  Mm-hmm.  Two jiggers of Robitussin.  Two shots.  Yeah, two shots.  A shot of quill.  Okay.  And some Excedrin.  And put a little jack in it, and you're set.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  So what have you been doing?  I'm watching a lot of television.  And there's nothing on, right?  Yeah.  I got to say, the Nintendo Battle Tanks commercial with the goof on the snuggles, the bear thing, 
[00:36:00]  it's hysterical.  If you happen to catch that.  You probably find everything hysterical at this point.  Yeah, everything is kind of funny.  How many times have you seen that commercial, I'm not my father's daughter, for that movie, Elizabeth or whatever?  I'm sick of that commercial.  Speaking of movie, dude.  Huh?  There's a movie coming out.  I just saw the ad for it today.  Yeah.  With Juliette Lewis.  Yeah.  Called The Other Sister.  Uh-huh.  She's a retard marrying a guy retard. 
[00:36:30]  And it's the whole thing with the parents wondering if they should get married.  Yeah.  And there's like retard sex.  And it looks like a scurrying.  I was roaring just at the appetizer for it.  Oh, that's classic.  So then they're doing this typical voice.  I beg, I beg.  I was dying.  They totally were doing that.  Wait until you see this commercial.  You'll die last.  I haven't seen the commercial yet.  It's great.  It must be really funny under the influence of Quill, too. 
[00:37:00]  Everything.  And then I was watching Some Kind of Wonderful, that movie with Jennifer Connelly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's a dirty girl.  I was going to say, you'd be the dirty boy.  And, yeah, that's about it.  Other than that, I'm sitting here, fever.  You get fever sack.  You know, fever sack?  Fever sack.  Fever sack?  Yeah, like your whole body's hot, so it does everything it can to cool down. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  It's like your sack.  It's like Turkish taffy.  And you got no drive.  You got no drive, right?  No.  No drive.  I'm done.  You're done, Ski.  I'm done, man.  Looks like I'm going solo tomorrow as well, huh?  I'll see.  Come on.  Be a trooper.  Come in.  You should see what the listeners are writing about, too.  Are they cruel?  Yeah, they're real cruel.  Bastards.  That's okay.  I'll get them all back.  That's right.  One at a time.  But that's okay.  We're fair game, just like everything else.  That's how it works. 
[00:38:00]  How's the controversy with the song?  Oh, the pre-song?  Yes.  Snicker in the background.  Why are you laughing?  Dude, it's not looking good for the boys.  No laughing.  What's the deal?  I think the Cardinal's involved.  The Cardinal?  Yeah.  The baseball team?  The football team?  The Cardinal?  What?  Leave it there.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, we've got to thank Stephen Lynch for getting us in trouble.  Yeah, like we weren't doing a good enough job by ourselves.  I know.  We need Stephen Lynch to help us.  Yeah, he had to push us right over the edge, man. 
[00:38:30]  He is the Antichrist.  Yes.  We had nothing to do with that song yesterday.  Oh, of course not.  We just gave the forum to broadcast it to a million people.  The best line yesterday, Anthony, after he did the pre-song, and it was obvious that  we were going to hell.  Yeah.  You'd come on the air and go, the O.P. and Anthony show has been removed from the airwaves.  Could be a prophecy.  Yeah.  Wouldn't be the first time, right, bro?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, get better. 
[00:39:00]  I wasn't even going to call you this hour.  I figured we'd let you slide, but...  Well, I was getting a little pumped.  I'm listening.  I'm getting up.  Oh, yeah.  Like, we're just rocking without you.  I'm sitting there.  It's just a different show without you, man.  And I switched back because I was listening to Rocky Allen, and...  One of his last shows.  I know.  Is he doing knuckleheads in the news today, Anthony?  I wasn't listening to that.  No, I'm kidding.  All right.  All right, man.  All righty.  We'll see you tomorrow.  For F.U. Friday. 
[00:39:30]  Thanks for hanging, Ralph.  My pleasure.  Feel better, man.  Is he the man or what, bro?  What?  He's the man, right?  He is.  All right, cool.  Kick ass.  All right, I'll talk to you.  There's our pal, right?  Poor Anthony.  He just sounds like crap.  Yeah, if you've got a fever, stay home.  Yes.  That'll just reinfect everybody.  We'll go around the cycle again.  Well, Gary got mad at me because I said...  I come in, I go, Anthony is just...  He's not happening.  This is the first time Anthony's been sick in four and a half years of us working together.  And I said, and I don't feel good either.  I got a fever. 
[00:40:00]  My eyeballs feel like they're going to pop out.  You know that when you get the eyeballs burning and stuff?  And he goes, dude, what are you doing here?  We would have put Tony Pig on the air.  Right.  I'm like, I don't know.  I want to come in a little too, right?  Yeah.  I said, I want to come in, man.  We're troopers.  We don't have a life when we're not on the radio.  So this is much better than staying home sick. </pre>
