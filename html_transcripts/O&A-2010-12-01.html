<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed and humorous recounting of the previous day's visit from Ozzy Osbourne.  Comedian Jim Norton, present in the studio, gifted Ozzy an 18-pound collection of Beatles books, resulting in much comedic awkwardness.  The hosts and Norton dissected a video of the event, focusing on Ozzy's non-committal reaction and eventual forgetting of the massive gift, which was later retrieved by Ozzy's representative, who only took Ozzy's favorite mug.  Ozzy's apparent off-air fascination with Wendy Williams' breasts was also mentioned.  The segment also touched upon upcoming guests, including Kevin Smith and Bob Saget, a fake news story about a TSA pat-down, the Jets-Patriots game, and Jim Norton's cluttered apartment filled with celebrity memorabilia. Norton also shared anecdotes about his childhood, including his family's unconventional and potentially dangerous garbage disposal methods.  Anthony described his mother's trash-burning habits.


The show continued with a discussion of the hosts' childhood memories and contrasting approaches to fire-starting.  This transitioned into a recurring humorous theme of a song with repetitive "la la la la" lyrics that Anthony loved and Opie hated, partially recreated and mocked throughout the broadcast.  The hosts and later guests discussed their respective families, holiday traditions, and difficult family dynamics, with Anthony sharing anecdotes about his mother's emotional struggles during the holidays and Opie detailing his dysfunctional family, using offensive language to describe his grandmother.  The conversation also included sexually explicit discussions about the hosts' personal preferences. A listener-submitted "la la la la" Christmas song by "Sherwin Sleeves" became a recurring joke, amplified by a call from Sherwin Sleeves himself.

The announcement of Sam's engagement led to a humorous exchange about his proposal—an unconventional event during a family Thanksgiving photo—the engagement ring, and the jeweler, Stephen Singer, who was relentlessly mocked.  Sam's mother, Bobby, called in to share her perspective on the proposal.  The conversation included details about the proposal, the family's reaction, and the father’s celebratory Dom Pérignon opening.  Charles Barkley's comment about Michael Jordan's mustache was also briefly discussed.

Sam further recounted the unconventional proposal, detailing his fiancée Jess's initial shock and the family's diverse reactions.  Bob Saget joined the show, discussing his new A&E show, "Strange Days," and anecdotes from filming, including his experiences with biker gangs and a Bigfoot search.  The conversation frequently devolved into off-color humor, including sexually explicit discussions and graphic anecdotes. Bob Kelly also appeared as a guest.  This segment heavily featured sexually explicit and offensive descriptions of genitalia, focusing on the hosts' and Bob Saget's preferences and reactions to various images.  The discussion briefly touched on Saget's "Strange Days" show,  a description of Magic Bob's lengthy and unexpected magic performance (including his assistant’s reluctance to remove his shirt), Bob Saget's appearance on *The View*, an incident with Susan Boyle, and the WikiLeaks founder and allegations against him.

The show then shifted to a conversation about the Spider-Man musical, focusing on Kevin Smith's humorous commentary and the generally negative critical reception.  Bob Saget called in again, reminiscing about his time as a warm-up comedian for *Bosom Buddies*. The conversation then shifted to the Spider-Man franchise, the upcoming reboot, and Sony's reasons for retaining control.  Jim Norton shared anecdotes from his involvement in the Spider-Man movie franchise. Kevin Smith promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.  The hosts discussed their frustrations with their hockey teams, their dislike of sports radio, and frequently used vulgar language.  The show concluded with promotion of Bob Saget's and Jim Norton's shows, including a sold-out show at the Borgata.  A pre-recorded "one question" interview with David Hasselhoff revealed he was wearing a black shirt.  Magic Bob's earlier appearance was mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  It's a fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dreams  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't even want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Can you just laugh off of the watching radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Yeah  Good morning  I haven't stopped laughing in 20 hours 
[00:01:00]  No, no  Were we on when that happened or no?  No, no, no  We were off  No, we were off when that's the final  There's more to the Jim Norton, Ozzy Osbourne, 18 pounds of birthday gifts saga  The final indignation, is it?  Well, I remember  Yesterday I walked out here just laughing like an idiot down the hall 
[00:01:30]  All the way home  Just laughing to myself  And then Anthony caught up with me  And told me that more stuff happened after I left  Which I can't imagine how more stuff happened  It was, oh, just tragic  I guess we've got to back up just slightly for maybe the people that missed yesterday's show  If you missed yesterday's show  Or maybe some of the newbies  Just really  Kill yourself  A quick recap anyway, right?  Yeah, yeah  Ozzy Osbourne came in here yesterday  And we love Ozzy 
[00:02:00]  Yeah  Jimmy has turned us on to Ozzy  I grew up with a little Black Sabbath  And then I veered off and became a Zeppelin fan  There was a time where it was either going to be Sabbath or Zeppelin  I went Zeppelin  Jimmy went all in with Sabbath  But always liked Ozzy over the years  Yeah, yeah  But because of Jimmy, really started liking Ozzy  Because he started doing our show a lot  And he's really a cool fucking guy  That guy is the definitive rock star of, like, decades  Yeah  And he, you know  I don't know 
[00:02:30]  I just got to say  We talk to a lot of A-list celebrities  Ozzy's the type of guy  You really feel like he's having a really good time on our show  Or he's the greatest actor ever  And could care less and just knows how to work it  Yeah  But it really seems genuine  And he's having a good time when he's in here  And he's funny as all hell, man  Yeah, that guy is a funny dude  Yeah  I loved yesterday  I really did  He was  That was fantastic  He was laughing through a lot of it  He was  I was just so happy  He was 
[00:03:00]  He was laughing  He was leaning on Jimmy  Oh, yeah  He was, like, patting his arm and stuff  Sure  It was good, like, two pals  He slapped me in the head  Yeah  To mimic jerking off  So we found out before Ozzy came in  That it's his birthday  Or tomorrow or Friday  The third, yeah  And Jimmy decided he needed to get Ozzy some birthday gifts  This is the quick recap  If you did not hear this  Please listen this weekend to this fine channel  Oh, yeah  When we do the best of the week  Because it'll probably be number one  That's probably  Because there was an hour  Where we were talking about the birthday gifts that Jimmy got 
[00:03:30]  And if they were appropriate gifts for Ozzy  And we just knew it wasn't going to go well  I don't know why  But we all knew it  We look at our adorable Jimmy  Just all full of goodness and happiness  And sweetness  And sweetness, yes  Certainly a sweet boy in there  His hero was coming in  He couldn't really decide which book to get Ozzy  So we got them all  And we weighed it  It was 18 pounds of books 
[00:04:00]  Four different books on the Beatles  Totaled 18 pounds  18 pounds  And then the tragedy started rolling out  When we realized one of the books was 10 years old  And that he probably had it at that point  Which he did  I get the hiccups again  From laughing  And then it just cascaded  Don't forget the part where then Jimmy  Wasn't sure of himself anymore  And he wanted to bail on the whole thing  And not give Ozzy the birthday gifts  And then me and you were like  You have to  At least for the radio at this point 
[00:04:30]  You have to do this  Before Ozzy even got here  There was the whole story of  Should he, shouldn't he  He was  He didn't know quite what to do  Very nervous about the whole thing  Because I didn't want Ozzy  Ozzy  I know he knows me now  I don't want the guy to think I'm a dick  I want him to like me  I don't want him to think that I'm a fucking creep  An obsessive idiot  Who goes on a third date  And buys a diamond engagement ring  Yes  Every kiss begins with Kate  That's exactly what it's like 
[00:05:00]  Oh yeah  Jimmy went to Jared  Exactly  So it started unraveling  Even before Ozzy got here  And then  And then through the whole interview  There's a pile of books all wrapped  Awkwardly in front of Jimmy  All wrapped  Yeah they were wrapped  They weren't just kind of  They didn't just  You didn't just bring them in a bag  They were wrapped  He also had his giant poster  It didn't even qualify as a photograph 
[00:05:30]  That he wanted to get signed  Yeah  He blew this thing into poster size  I had to  It was my only picture  Ozzy's like smiling with me  So I had to blow that one up  It was good  How big was the picture again?  13 by 21  13 by 21  It is the good size for a photo  Where are you going to put that?  I think the biggest picture I got in my house  Is like an 8 by 10  8 by 10 is about that  Maybe a little bigger  Dude I always liked that  But I have a couple pictures  Like that one 
[00:06:00]  And there's one more  I have a good picture of me and Lemmy together  Which was blown up in laminate  There's some stuff that's bigger  Honestly  I would love to beat you up about that  But when I come over to your place  You got some cool ass pictures  It's cool as fuck  The thing is  It all adds in to the whole thing  It doesn't look like an adult's apartment  No  But it still looks cool  Dude I was thinking that last night  Because I was hanging something  Once in a while I would switch photos around  Unfortunately it wasn't yourself  Believe me my girlfriend thought the same thing  She's like you sure you don't want a rope and a stool to go up 
[00:06:30]  You don't have any beams in your apartment  Oh well  I was  I was  I was hanging this  This Ozzy thing I have  And I just like  Like this  It's signed by Randy Rhodes  It's like a really hard to get  Thing that Florentine gave me years ago  I love it  And I'm like this is not  A 42 year old man's apartment  I just didn't feel  And I'm standing at my little Lemmy figure  I have like a little Lemmy figure  He's holding a guitar  And it had fallen over  And his little arm fell off  My little Lemmy arm fell off  So I had 
[00:07:00]  And the microphone broke  So I'm like just readjusting it  And you know  It's on top of my Dallas Cowboys football  And next  And next to my Ace Freely doll  It really is  That's fantastic  But I can't put it over here  Because that's where all my signed baseballs are  I'm like this is not a grown-up's place  Little children's  Oh yeah  This is the Lemmy doll right there  Eventually you're going to need  You're going to need a big house  I do  Does it come with a sugar pop  On the side of his face  Yeah 
[00:07:30]  His little right arm fell off  The poor fella  Aw  Poor Lemmy  Poor Lemmy  Yeah  I mean  Your fans would love to walk through your place  It is  It's like a museum type  I mean I wonder if somehow  You could like display that somewhere  For a week or so  You would do well  A gallery showing  I'm serious  I don't know how expensive that would be  But maybe if you do it in Jersey or something  Get out of Manhattan  I've thought of it  But it would have to be obviously  With funny  It would have to be something for people to see  Like  I would have to write funny stuff with it 
[00:08:00]  It would have to be  Yeah  A story behind the picture  There's a way to do it though  Yeah  Maybe an audio tour  Yeah  With little Jimmy explaining everything  It would have to just be photos  But I don't know if I have enough of them yet to do that  To justify  An event  An event  That goes with it  Yeah  Well anyway  With Ozzy and the presents and the books  And everything that went on yesterday  I had a great interview with Ozzy  Yeah  And we all knew that eventually 
[00:08:30]  It was going to lead to the present  Sitting in front of Jimmy  And Ozzy unwrapped him  He was very gracious  He had said that he did have the anthology book  The giant one  The giant one  The expensive one  The expensive one  Jimmy then gave Ozzy  And in the video  When you give him the card  I didn't even realize how mushy you were  It was like giving  That wasn't that mushy though  No, no  You know something?  As I was watching live  Sitting here  It didn't come off as mushy or anything 
[00:09:00]  Right  But watching it on video  It comes off  A little bit  Boyfriend, girlfriend  Oh no  First Valentine's Day card  Oh yeah  Absolutely  Shooting your high  Awkwardness  Yeah, yeah  It's a little awkward  Know why?  Because the card wasn't on top of the presents  No, no, no  So then it would have just been part of the gift  He pulled it out  And I know why he did it  And tell me if I'm wrong  You were feeling pretty good about the whole thing  And how it went down  I went, you know what?  Feeling pretty good about Ozzy's books  La, la, la, shut up 
[00:09:30]  You weren't sure if you wanted to give him the card  But then it went so well  When he was opening the gift  You're like, yeah, what the hell  I'm going to give him the card too  And you pulled it out of your jacket  Or your pocket  Or whatever  You're right  I had actually signed it  Because again, the only reason I had that  Was they just  They handed it to you  And I didn't  I told you my chick yelled at me  Don't write it in the book  She's like, it's not about you forever  It's not about you  You could have put that just on the wrapped gifts  That's part of the thing  But at one point  I was so doubting  I was going to go through with this  I'm like, I can't do it  And that was from you guys 
[00:10:00]  Not him  Him I knew I would give the card to  But I'm like, I can't  I hadn't written anything in it  That was like, you mean so much to me  It was nothing douchey like that  It was just a nice little sentiment  And it was happy birthday  Whoa, slow down  A little douchey  You think so?  A little douchey  You said he was bigger than the Beatles  But I was kind of a goof  Because I'm a fan  But they're all Beatles books  So that's why I tied it  I'm like, the Beatles were great  Second only to you  Happy birthday, Jim  Second only to you  But it's like, it's  Love your Jim 
[00:10:30]  But I didn't say that  Love your grandson, Frank  I drew him a picture  Slightly douchey  Maybe  Slightly  But it literally was only because  There were Beatle books  And I was purposely not writing anything  Like, hey, thanks for 30  I was purposely not trying to put anything  That would be anything other than a little whatever  You know what the awkwardness comes from  And we've all been in this situation  I've been in it  We've goofed on it many times  When you have a fan  When you're a fan  Right  A legitimate fan  Of a guest that comes in here 
[00:11:00]  You get this giddiness that goes on  Yes  I am totally guilty of the same thing  All of us are  Shawnee Smith  I was a fucking babbling idiot with her  Yeah, I know  She's a fuckable chick  This is a 62-year-old gentleman  Your example's not good, Anthony  You were trying to get your dick in our hole  I was just trying to make an analogy  A little example of how we do get a little starstruck with some people  Yeah  And you do with Ozzy  Very  Which is fine  The thing is, the card, the way you gave it to him 
[00:11:30]  If you watch the video  And by the way, the listeners, viewers of that video  Have dissected it like this Bruder film  Oh, thank God  They are going frame by frame  Are they really?  They're talking about facial expressions  They're talking about  Like, what did Jimmy  What was he feeling during frame 362?  Oh, that's hilarious  Oh, they are  There's one frame that says it all  Because you were laughing hard like me and Ant were  And then you turn to look at the GIFs  And there's a serious look on your face 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah  There's one second  It's when I come close to the camera, right?  It's one frame  You're looking at the books  And the books are there  Maybe a split second  And then you go back to laughing  But there's a moment where you look like  Holy shit  Split second  He didn't take the books  Oh, it was  I so tried to  I'll tell you what happened with the  Well, do we tell people what happened?  Like, what  No, no, we didn't tell them  You were doing a live read  Indignity  We ended the show  Yeah  Yeah  And the fuck  Do we go back on the air at all or no?  The whole thing was on the air  I thought it wasn't 
[00:12:30]  Because technically  Technically we didn't end the show  Right, after the read  All of that was on the air  So usually Anthony does the live read  After we step away  But because we were so late  Even though the show ended  Ant went into live reading mode  And you and Ozzy were talking about  Talking on TV  Doing stand-up  Yeah, and also you were looking at TV  Looking at Wendy Williams  Giant tits  I took that part out of the video  Because I wasn't sure his wife would appreciate  That Ozzy was really into Wendy Williams' tits  But we  Wait, so he  Oh, because I remember I was 
[00:13:00]  The people knew that  Yeah, they heard all that  I was so glad they actually did  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  All that was in it  And then I heard Opie laughing  And say there it is  And say there it is  Then he just found it  I'm still talking about something  Because I don't know what's going on  And then when I looked  And saw the pile of books  And Ozzy was gone  Well, from my  I lost my mind  No, from my perspective  I'm like  The whole time I'm thinking  Is Ozzy going to take the books  Or is one of his guys  Going to come in here  And take the books  So when the show ended 
[00:13:30]  You started live read mode  Yeah  I zoomed in on Ozzy  And Jimmy  And then I'm looking at  I'm looking at  There's the look  You gotta  See that's  You gotta tweet that, Jimmy  No, because it really is  I have to say  It's in between  It's like  When one fat face  Is melding into another fat face  It does look like  You're looking down  Going like  But I really wasn't  No, I know  I'll be very honest  Yeah, because the very next frame  You're just smiling  Like happy Jimmy  Yeah  So I zoomed in on Ozzy 
[00:14:00]  And Jimmy and his aunt  Is doing the live read  And out of the corner of my eyes  I'm kind of filming  I'm looking at the fucking books  And I'm like  I don't think he's fucking  Taking these things  Yeah  And then I was trying  To get aunt's attention  Because aunt was laughing at Jimmy  About how  I was just laughing at the whole thing  How he was just being fanboy  And I'm like  Fuck that  You're not going to believe  What's going on right now  How they had to drag Ozzy  Out of here  Right  Because he was late for things  And you and Ozzy were talking  And I was laughing at that  And then once  I saw that stack of books  Sitting exactly where  Ozzy had placed them down 
[00:14:30]  After he unwrapped them  I lost my fucking mind laughing  I mean  It was the saddest  Little boy moment  I'd ever seen  It really was  He had to go though  He had to go to  Here's what happened  You tell us  How you got to sleep  Last night  Well Travis  Did you sleep last night?  Not really  But I mean  I can't wait to hear  What your girl said  About this whole thing  Dude she just hugged me  I can't wait  Really?  She was like  Oh  Oh that is so sweet  And I'm like 
[00:15:00]  Don't  And then we watched the video  And I was  I was really great  Yeah yeah  And then she was  She just kept hugging me  She's like  Oh  That is very sweet  And I'm like  But I don't feel sad  I really didn't  Because what happened was  After it was done  The pile of books  Sad  The pile of gift  As it were  18 pounds of books  Yes  The almost 20 pounds of gift  I literally  If I had gotten him  Two nine pound bricks  But Ozzy  Went to pick them up 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  He went to take them  And I told him to leave them  He went to pick them up  Like he grabbed them  He didn't run out  It's like normally  When an interview is done  You would just  Alright guys  But he actually  Was just standing there  Well people had said  That you completely  Sabotaged your own gift giving  By talking to Ozzy  I did  But he went  He went to grab them  I'm like  We'll get Tony to grab them  Because Tony's his guy  But that's all I needed  Was for fucking Ozzy  Just to take these  And have one of them  Fall off and smash  His fucking 
[00:16:00]  The top of his foot bone  And break his toe  And have to cancel  Two shows because of me  I just  I didn't want  You know  It's like  Oh my god  But the guys  There's fucking ten guys  Let them do it  Sure  Oh my god  So he left it there  And then he just  Started talking to me  And he's like  What time do you get up  For this  And I'm like  Five  And I do comedy at night  And he's like  You're doing comedy at night  Like on weeknights  And we're just  We're just chatting  And he's not leaving  He's just hanging  And then he looks up  At Wendy Williams on TV  And he goes  Who's that  Look at her tits  He sits up at Wendy  So me and Ozzy  Just looking at Wendy Williams' tits  I'm like  That's Wendy Williams  Who is she 
[00:16:30]  I'm like  Well she's  A radio chick  And then the door had opened  And Mike from Sony  Literally he just had to  I heard he had to go  Right to Fuse  From here  He had to go to Fuse  And then the president of Sony  Was presenting him  With something  So he had a hard out  Did he leave that too  No I'm sure he didn't  And then the book's  Just sat there  Yeah and then he left  Oh my god  And then his  But that's why  I wasn't sad  Because normally  Of course I would have  Felt like a douche  Yeah  But I didn't 
[00:17:00]  I knew what happened  And Ozzy's a little  Forgetful sometimes  Could be sure  He referred to Jon Stewart  And Stephen Colbert  As those guys  Those guys  And we were supposed to know  Those guys who did that thing  From those guys  But Ozzy left his mug here  Yes  Wait before you get to that  Really fast  That's the big story  Just be  So Ozzy's long gone  Yes  We're laughing our asses off  And just when you think that  It couldn't get any better  Roland pops his head in  Because a lot of people are saying  What did Roland say  And I actually put  That was great  By the way that you put that 
[00:17:30]  I put that on the  So you know exactly what Roland said  If you look at the video  But Roland peeks his head in  And in perfect timing  Goes  He wants the books  And Jimmy goes  No he doesn't  And then Roland goes  I know  Yeah  But he got me  There was a glimmer of hope  Because Roland goes  He wants his books  He wants his books  It was a kill shot  And you turn around like  No he doesn't  Like hoping  Like hoping that he did  And Roland without missing a beat  Just goes  Perfect timing  You're right  Roland goes  I know 
[00:18:00]  He got me so good  Because I'll be  No he doesn't  It was almost like  Hey that chick wants to fuck you  No she doesn't  Like really  Really  But here would have been  The honest moment  Say  If emotionally I was being honest  Say he wants  He asks for the books  Ozzy asks for the books  I'm so happy  Because I really felt bad  For a second  No  So that's where the video ends  And you can check it out  On the YouTube channel  OP Radio  Now the big thing is 
[00:18:30]  It wasn't a complete loss  For Jimmy  Right  Because Ozzy  Most people just come in here  And drink water out of the bottles  Or they have styrofoam cups  Or coffee cups  Or whatever  Ozzy came in with this  Lovely ceramic  Christmas mug  Christmas mug  I thought we gave him that  That he was drinking out of  That's his mug  And Jimmy looked at that  Like the last bastion of hope  In this whole  Grim situation  Of gift giving  The Holy Grail had been left here  Yes the Holy Grail 
[00:19:00]  As it were  He had like soda  Or something in it  I didn't see what was in it  Uh huh  Maybe some tea or something  Tea right  It might have been tea  Yeah and it was sitting right there  It was Ozzy's mug  I could see  Jimmy was just thinking  Like he's taking it home  And he even said  I'm going to take this with me  Use it at home  Yeah  I'm going to wash it out  And drink out of it  It's like this  This will be Ozzy's mug  Great piece of memorabilia  Right next to the 18 pounds  Of books by the way  Yes  Within minutes  Of him  Kind of having that glimmer of hope  That something good came out of this whole disaster 
[00:19:30]  Of Ozzy's birthday  When the laughter died down  Jimmy was like  I got his mug  I'm not ready to leave  I'm taking this home  And drinking coffee  Exactly  Immediately  The door opens  A gentleman walks in  From Ozzy's camp  From Ozzy's camp  To get the books I guess  And yeah yeah  We were thinking  Oh maybe the books  And he goes  Um  I need the mug  That Ozzy left here  It's his favorite mug  And he doesn't drink out of anything else  So I gotta take the mug  Yeah it was  It was Liam 
[00:20:00]  He came in  He goes  He has to have that mug  I think that one of his guys  Realized  Ozzy probably has to  Where's my mug  Yeah yeah  He didn't even say  The books  Why didn't one of the guys  Realize that  The guy didn't say  Can I have the books  And the mug  He came back specifically  For the mug  And grabbed the mug  And left  And everyone was shell shocked  Because it happened so fast  The guy just came in  That we even  No one remembered to go  Hey how about you  Take the books back to Ozzy  So he left  With the mug  Still leaving the books behind  Oh my god 
[00:20:30]  And uh  So there was Jim  With the stack of books  He had bought  And no mug  Just no mug  They took the mug  They did take the  Take that  What's it  Take the mug  Take the mug  So um  Where are the books now  I don't know  They're here  But believe me  Because someone said  Please tell me  Jimmy had to walk home  With the books  Oh god  Imagine the  20 pounds of books  Under his arm  As he's trying to  Hail a cab in the rain  They're getting wet  And ruined  Ruined  They're ruined  I was 
[00:21:00]  The books are still  On site  The books are here  Those are very  Very famous books  I believe they're here  For the next time  Ozzy does come in  Do you think  He doesn't visit  Very often  No  They're six months  So it'll be a while  But do you think  He's getting away with that  Do you think  That he will not  Someday have that  On his coffee table  But he was  He was very nice about it  Oh he certainly was  Watch your mail  To his house  Out there in  Beverly Hills  Ship 20 pounds of books  I actually got  It's funny  Because I had emailed  Sharon last week 
[00:21:30]  To ask her something  Because I do the  Boneyard show  I wanted to ask  Something about this  Re-release of  Blizzard and  Whatever  And I finally  Heard back from her  Last night  So I had to  Email her  She was like  I hope things  Went well with Ozzy  Today  Fantastic  Couldn't have went  Better  You didn't bring up  The books  Oh I did  It was funny  Oh god  That is great  I did  Yeah  I did  It's just  Watching the video  Though  I watched it  A few times  God damn  Did you retweet

[00:22:30]  The mini  It's really hard  Not to eat  Deliciousness  Everywhere  It's so hard  But anyway  For anyone that watches the video  I know I'm a fat pig  Please  I know  They have to just  Dissect everything  I don't know  If they said anything  I didn't read any comments  I might not want to read the comments  Oh I don't care  I'm just arguing  I wouldn't be offended  Because they're right  I know when I put on  But I put on 10 pounds  I know it  It's got to go  But that's the only part  I was embarrassed about  I was watching  You look the same to me  But I just watch  But then again  I'm not gay  Like have these fucking guys 
[00:23:00]  That have to comment  On our appearance  All the time  Dude I'm so pale  That any weight I put on  Is noticeable  Because you can't see  Any structured definition  Separating things  I look like a flesh stalk  Like my eyes  Look like an extension  Of my stomach and chest  Anyway sorry  So you wrote Sharon  About the books  Oh yeah I just told her  It happened  But I was  It was very  I wrote to her  I won't read the whole thing  But I said  Ozzy was great as always  We had a lot of good laughs  For his birthday  I bought him  Four hardcover Beatles photos  Which totaled 18 pounds 
[00:23:30]  And I put them in capital letters  Did you write photos?  Photo books  Oh okay  I bought him  Four hardcover Beatle photo books  And I wrote  I'm a true horse's ass  He was rushed out  To make it to a fuse interview  So he wound up  Leaving them on the counter  In studio  Which was a hilarious  Ending to the show  Me and my stupid  Giant pile of books  Stupid giant pile  I wrote that to you  I said he really seemed  To enjoy himself today  It was one of the most  Fun times of having  And that's why I'm going  Because she asked  If I was going  To one of the shows  But yeah 
[00:24:00]  It was a very funny ending  It really honestly  I had so much fun yesterday  It was unbelievable  And sitting next to him  Like that  I know  We've interviewed enough people  And I've talked to him enough  He really had a good time  Yeah  And I know he enjoyed it  And he was laughing  Through most of the interviews  He wasn't rushing  To get out of here  No  Other people  There's no doubt  He had a fucking great time  He had a lot of fun  That's all I cared about  That was one of the most  Fun times I've ever had  On the earth  And now you got  The video and the pictures  Danny was taking pictures  The whole  Danny did great man  He got probably like 
[00:24:30]  90 photos  A lot of candid shots  Yeah  And it's hard to take  With a camera  Unless you have  A tremendous shutter speed  Because when one of us  Is laughing  And there's movement  But they still came out good  Can I  What did your girl say  So she just hugged you  Anything else there  She hugged me  And she was like  She felt really bad  Because she was like  She knew  About me buying the  And I said to her  I was like  Yeah  I was like  I told him  And she bit my head  Because I'm like  Yeah I told him  About your idea  About getting a gift bag  They were laughing  And she's like  What are we going to do 
[00:25:00]  Give them to him  In a fucking borders bag  And I'm like  I guess you're right  Oh right  Jesus  It's very funny  She really gave me  A good smashing yesterday  Oh and well she should  But no she felt bad for me  Because she just kept  Hugging me  Going oh  She felt really bad for me  But I'm like  You don't have to  I gotta tell you  The video  The video is really  Just is a moment obviously  But it doesn't  Truly do it justice  Make sure you listen  To the best of this weekend  On this channel  You gotta hear the whole setup  Because the build up  Where Jimmy talks  About the gifts  I think we talked about  For 45 minutes  We absolutely did 
[00:25:30]  Yeah  And then  Should he  Should he  You know  Blow it off  Yeah where he doesn't  Quite know  If he should  Or shouldn't  And then the confidence  When Ozzy liked the first book  When he unwrapped it  Oh my god  Well I figured it was  Going good by then  And we were having a fun  The whole interview  I thought like  Well will it be about  The books or won't it  Like I didn't know  And then it turned out  Not to be  Like we were just  We were just fucking  Did he call you  Homo sweet  Yes that was funny  Yeah yeah  Homo sweet  He goes oh  You're so homo sweet  That was the 
[00:26:00]  Fucking  Homo sweet  It was a very  Thank you  It was a very  Very funny moment  I don't  I can't remember  The last time  I laughed that hard  That was great  That made the video  Your laugh  Because I was watching  From your flip cam  Point of view  And I saw  It was really  A great job  With the video  Because you  Transcribed Roland's  Which was great  Yeah  And I just  Your building  Of your laugh  On those pile of books  Is fucking great  And then  I can hear Ant going 
[00:26:30]  And they're physically  Removing Ozzy  From little Jimmy Norton  Like it was very funny  To hear that natural moment  And then that  And the reason why  That was great  The reason why  I'm loud in the video  Is because I'm holding  The camera  You didn't have a boom mic  It's so exhausting  Does the flip cam  Come with a boom mic  I'm holding the camera  That's why  Yeah he's right  He's right there  And it was like  You weren't hearing  That audio  Through microphones  You were  That flip cam audio  Is through a flip cam  Right  Yeah because that's all 
[00:27:00]  We're doing right now  We really need to  You know  Yeah whatever  It was very funny  Let's just keep it fun  But I mean  You know  It's so obvious  That this show  Needs a visual element  It's so obvious  But they're not all in  Down the hall  For some reason  It was fun  So we do what we can  Here and there  I think it came out  Oh god dude  I really did laugh  And I could  I could not have been  Happier with that interview  I really could have  It was so much fun  Everyone  I talked to  People  The stuff I read 
[00:27:30]  On Twitter  Was just that  Everyone loved it  But it was hysterical  Keith called me  At one point  He was driving  Into work  And listening  To the replay  And he goes  Because I told him  What happened yesterday  When I got home  He was there  Doing some work  And he said  I'm at the part  Where you guys  Are just talking  About his poster  Size photograph  And he goes  Already  I just know  This is not  Going to go well  He got the photograph  Or the poster  Signed  What did he write 
[00:28:00]  He was writing  For a while  To Jim  You are the best  Love Ozzy  It was actually  A great photo of us  It's after I did  The hour with him  To promote Scream  That was out in LA  No no that was here  That was in  Didn't you interview him  In LA  That was the MTV building  Here in New York  We used their studio  Gotcha  I did Bill Ward in LA  And we took a couple  Of really nice photos  Together  But this was a really  Good one  We were smiling together  And he's like  That's a great picture  He commented on  What a good picture it was 
[00:28:30]  I was so happy  Yeah  But he genuinely  He genuinely enjoyed it  And now  Believe me  I know he knows me  That's all I care about  That's it  He probably doesn't  Know me by name  But he knows my face  It's great  Let's say hi to Tammy  In Tennessee  Tammy  Hi Tammy  Yes I love you  Jimmy Norton  I love you  Opie and Anthony  Thank you  Oh thank you  I listen to your show  Every day  I'm dedicated  Thank you  I listen to it  Twice a day  Tennessee  Morning and afternoon 
[00:29:00]  No it is  And but I was just wondering  It's a slower pace  Than New York  Yeah  Is what I noticed  Yeah  But I was just wondering  Compare it to the eastern  Or western coast  No I'm not wondering  Will you just get  Your point across  What do you want to say Tammy  Yes Tammy  We talked about Opie yesterday  And we've talked about him today  For 39 minutes  Mentioned his name about 50 to 60 
[00:29:30]  Maybe 70 times  That's right  Are we going to talk about anything else  No I'll be honest Tammy  Here's the schedule  One  Hang up on inbred retards  That's number one on the schedule  Okay  No  I love the people that can't  Tammy we're just  I love the people that can't pick up on the fact that  A moment went down  It doesn't matter  If we're going to now talk about it for another hour  People want to hear this  They want  They want  They want  The dissection of what happened 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  But then you got dummies like Tammy  From Tennessee  Dummies  Excuse me  Who's too busy fucking her brother  Yeah  Let's understand what the fuck is going on  Excuse me  With the show she enjoys so much  But she doesn't understand it  Listen to that twang  Hello come in  Hello come in  Ozzy  What  Ozzy  I love  Ozzy  Ozzy  Ozzy  Yay  I want everyone today  If they get on the air with us  To just say Ozzy  Ozzy  Say his name  Say his proper name 
[00:30:30]  John Michael Osborne  I want his name mentioned  Okay  John Michael Osborne  Atta girl  There you go  There you go Tammy  It was a very fun  Alright bye Tammy  Tell me to recap  Here's the thing  She doesn't understand  The reason it's a little bit of a bigger moment  Than most normal interviews  Is because I  You know  Everybody knows I'm a fanatic  For the guy  And for many years  We all have these  Of course  These weird  Like when Danny went down and got  And tried to get Mustaine to sign the guitar  Right  It became  Oh yeah  It becomes a thing 
[00:31:00]  It became more  Than just a guy who couldn't get something signed  I forgot about that  It's a whole fucking thing  I didn't  You didn't forget that  No  But it's always nice  When there's a humiliating  Celebrity dick in you  To bring your friend in  Who's also swabbed  His own ass blood  Off a fucking celebrity dick  I forgot about that one  Yeah  Danny just running around the building  Like Super Mario  With his guitar  Yeah  Yeah he's fucking strumming it  Like that guy in the foot  He did  Crambo  Tom and Jerry 
[00:31:30]  He had to play with Tom's fucking  Crambo  But it's like one of those things  Where it becomes more than just the moment  It's like  Because we know how much he loves  That's what it  Yeah yeah  Before we wrap this whole thing up for now  I'm not done  No we're going to go until 940  Yes  Were you sad at all?  No  Honestly no  It was like  Did you reflect on the whole thing  After the show?  When you were kind of in your apartment?  Honestly my feelings about the whole thing were  And I really honestly  Was that  I know he would have 
[00:32:00]  Because he physically did  And Travis even said to me  Because I got the audio of him  Of you telling him not to take the books  Oh okay  I guess it got picked up by Mike  And I didn't even realize it  You got it Irock?  Irock welcome back  Congratulations  Oh  What do you have here?  So I guess  Where was he?  I have to get Ozzy out  I've seen you guys  Ozzy we love you bro  Thank you Ozzy we love you  Alright  Always the best  I guess we're done too right  We'll see you guys tomorrow  Of course we are  I'm looking at  I'll tell you guys for you  Oh well  Can you sign a picture of us? 
[00:32:30]  Oh there it is  I'll tell you again for you  Could you sign a picture of us  And that's where  That was the breakdown right there  Well then you started just talking  I guess you gotta call Tony  The moment of impact  No I never got Tony  I know but call him  You know him  Tell him to come  I don't have his books  He's asleep  I actually  Where are the books?  I gotta see the books today  The big pile of them  They really are  I'll take a photo of them  It's giant  A day after  A giant pile of books  A pile  I would actually like a photo  Holding the books  Yes  If you can hold them that long  Your fans would love those books  My fans can buy them 
[00:33:00]  I have a receipt  They're famous books now  They're extremely famous books  Famous books now  The  But honestly  The interview  Like he was  I was  It's like you know  I made him laugh a little bit  It was like he had so much fun  We were yelling at you  Because you asked me if he looked at tits  Oh yeah yeah yeah  I know  It was fantastic  Fucking love  So I felt great after  A lot of laughs  Good  I loved it  A lot of laughs with the gentleman  Alright  Why don't we  Why don't we take our first break  We got a busy show  We got Kevin Smith calling in today at 9.30  Oh good 
[00:33:30]  I think he's playing Long Island this weekend right  The old Westbury  That has to be sold out  That's huge  Alright go ahead  Just drop them on the console  There's the books  Ah look at that  Those books are so famous now  In the bag  The big fucking Barnes and Noble bag  Also Bob Saget's coming in here in about an hour  His new show is called Strange Days  It's on A&E  What is it  I didn't see it  I saw the first two episodes  I like it  He just puts himself in weird situations  No it's like reality  Oh oh  He puts himself in weird fucking situations 
[00:34:00]  The first episode  Which I think aired last night  I saw it beforehand  He was hanging out with a hardcore biker gang  Like the real deal kind of thing  Yeah yeah yeah  And you would think it would be Bob Saget goofing on the whole thing  But it got real serious  Yeah  Which I kind of liked  Kind of liked to see another side of Bob Saget  And then the other episode  Which is next week  I saw already  He hangs out with Bigfoot hunters  Bigfoot hunters  It's a good show  Every week he's doing something a little different  It's weird how Saget became this  He really is an iconic figure 
[00:34:30]  As far as  From good natured stuff  Right  America's Funniest Home Videos  And  Two of the biggest shows ever  That other piece  Was the show  That other piece of shit  But yeah  Both very family friendly things  Yes  And really you cannot  They're in syndication  Like a mother  He is a really famous guy  For that mentality  And then he was on that game show  One vs. 100  I guess I was the only one  I loved  I really loved the show  And he laughs when I bring it up 
[00:35:00]  But I really liked that game show  It just didn't stick  Bad time  I think they had it on at a bad time  And also I think  Howie Mandel's show  Yeah  Just won that battle  I think that's what it was  It was kind of a battle between those two  And then also  At 8 o'clock today  Magic Bob  Magic Bob  Magic Bob  And I just think of  What Jimmy says  About Magic Bob  This is Bob's new thing  His new thing  His new thing right  Bob's always finding  What's up 
[00:35:30]  Oh no no  He's  Danny's saying  There are tickets available  For Kevin Smith  Because I guess he's doing it  Primarily  In Westbury  Is he doing it  In the round  Yes  It's the NYCB  Theater at Westbury  Where the stage  Fucking rotates  The entire show  He may rotate  He may not  Sometimes they set it up  But either way  It's an amazing venue  Very cool  And Kevin gives you  Your fucking money  No what I was saying  Magic Bob  This is his latest thing  He's a magician  No to get rid of the demons  Or whatever  You talk about how Bob's  Always finding something 
[00:36:00]  Oh yeah  Something new to  Occupy his time  So he doesn't have to  Think about  You know  Who he is  So he doesn't have to  Look in the spiritual mirror  As we say  See what dreck he is  Not that he wants to  Look in the physical one either  But the spiritual mirror  Is really bad for Bob  So for the first time  On our show  Magic Bob  Yeah  God we gotta do it  All over again today  What the fuck  Hello  My name's Ozzy Osbourne  And you're listening to my pal  Little Jimmy Norton  What a fucking little guy he is  Yeah  No more tears

[00:47:00]  A repeater router  And me and Danny  Are going around the house  Checking every  Frickin closet  I'm up in the attic  Finally found it  In a storage closet  Somewhere  Against the ceiling  You don't have any  Arsenic in your house  Do you  I don't think so  Why are you  Watching those crime shows  What's going on  Over there  You've lost control  Of your house  And Keith's wife  Does get mail sent there  Which Keith said  They're just trying  To establish residency  So they can throw me  Out of my own house  Well fuck it  Let them pay the property taxes 
[00:47:30]  Yeah exactly  You pay the taxes  I would love to  Find out you're a squatter  In your own home  Yeah  They kick you out  They throw me out  I'm like what  What happened  How did this happen  But in some weird twist  You still got to pay  The mortgage and the bills  Yeah I'm looking  Through the front door  Keith is stoking my fire  That's  That's not  That's not  Oh my god  Is that the Santa  Is that yours  Is that your scary  Yeah you know what  I think  Travis had it saved  From last year  Oh wow  He made it extra creepy too  Yeah he sure did  Nice hipstamatic shot 
[00:48:00]  Yeah that is creepy  You know I  Getting back to the fire  Drawing that thing  Can I get back to the fireplace  For a second  Yes  I shouldn't like fires  Because when we were kids  One of our jobs  Uh oh  You know we had jobs  Of course you had that  Living with mommy and daddy  We had a wood burning stove  Because of course  Why turn on the heat  When you have a wood burning stove  I like a wood burning stove  It's nice and warm  Three feet from the stove  Exactly  And then your bedroom  Exactly  Upstairs or something  Is freezing fucking cold  You nailed it 
[00:48:30]  Exactly  So you had to be around  The wood burning stove  To appreciate the heat  Everywhere else in the house  Was freezing  It's great when you lived  In a log cabin  A one room log cabin  Yeah  Because my mom was convinced  That they were going to  Knock on our door  At any moment  And kick us all out  For some reason  Because we didn't pay  Our heating bill  Whatever  So my dad  You got the bright idea  He can't  And you can't pay for wood  That's dumb too  Because that's another bill  There's wood all over  That's why they call it the woods  We had woods  In the back of our house  It's wood there  But we forested that shit 
[00:49:00]  Yeah  There was a time  We were knocking down trees  Just to feed this wood burning stove  Was the Hughes family  Getting accused of deforestation  Were you just clearing out  Fucking  Did some things  Did some things  Pulling down rainforest  And then my dad  Got a little nervous  That maybe they would  Be on to us  So he got  And some of these  Some of you guys  Can relate to this  He got the paper roller  Do you know what  This paper roller thing is about  It's supposed to roll up  Your newspaper so tight  I was 12 years old  That it makes a virtual log  I was rolling paper logs  As a 12 year old 
[00:49:30]  It was misery  That is  And then you had to put  Wire around them  To keep them together  And then we were  Throwing those in the  Wood burning stove  They make crazy embers too  They sure do  Paper is not good to burn  Did I also tell you  That my mom got the bright idea  And this is why I think  I'm brain damaged  And can't read properly  You know that she started  Burning our garbage  In the wood burning stove  No  No  Yes  Like a fucking  Yes  Why  Like an incinerator 
[00:50:00]  I got brain damage  Like an incinerator  In your house  Yes  Where's my brothers  What kind of garbage  They steer clear  Of this conversation  Like food stuff  What kind of garbage  Plastic  What kind of  Imagine what you throw away  So like a plastic milk bottle  Or something  That's what I'm getting at  Burning plastic  In my house  Wow  Yes  I got brain damage  And the ash from that stuff  Is toxic  Of course  Like they  And what were you like  Cleaning the ash  Was one of your jobs  To clean the ash  Yes 
[00:50:30]  And I don't know  I mean did you have to pay  For garbage removal  Back then  I don't even know  I think you had to pay  Your carter  In  On Long Island  It was private carter  Okay so there was a time  We did away with that  To save another bill  And she was burning  The garbage  For a long time  That had to be  All the plastic milk bottles  And  Oh yeah  Wow  And then we had to bury  The remains in the backyard  You know all the metal  And shit that didn't burn down  And the toxic ash 
[00:51:00]  Yes  When they burn  At these incinerators  The ash is so toxic  It's treated as toxic waste  There you go  That's probably not good  To breathe into your home  Oh my goodness  You would smell the plastic burning  Between that and the paper logs  Maybe I should stay away  From fires  That's a fan  I've also  It's another obsession of mine  With the fire  Is to be able to  Start the fire  With the minimal amount  Of paper  And the minimal amount  Of lights  Because I was very bad  At lighting a fire  I needed those 
[00:51:30]  Those fucking  Duraflame  Fire starter  Cubes  And they're like  Giant bullion cubes  And I would use like  Four of them  Right  And light them  And throw logs on  And still fuck it all up  Now it's like a ritual  One little roll of paper  One little roll of news day  Or something  Tucked in there  And then you gotta  Pull the sticks off  And feel like  Like I'm  Stranded on a desert isle  That's awesome  It's great  Then you sit on the couch  You watch some shitty television 
[00:52:00]  With a crackling fire  So a drink in your hand  Of course  Burn a quart of wood  Burn a quart of wood  A week  I need more wood  I'm crazy with it  Poking the fire  Poke the fire  I'm poking at the fire  With the la la la la  Getting more wood  And that's what  Ant doesn't understand  About that song  Him obsessing over the fire  That's his la la la  Is that my la la la  That's his la la la  That's my la la la  Trying to get it stoked now  A la la la la  Just want to have a glass 
[00:52:30]  A la la la la  Think today about the radio  La la la  That's all it is  Is that it?  No it's shit  It sucks  I love the la la la  I was telling my girlfriend  Last night  Because that song  Was in my head  It was stuck in my head  Feeling pretty good  Good  I don't remember that  I don't know that part  Did he say that?  Feeling pretty good  It's my favorite part  Where did he say that?  Just how he says good  Good  Ah fuck  Why did you ask?  Every day now  Until Christmas  I was feeling pretty good  La la la la la 
[00:53:00]  Taking my time  On the la la la la  On the foam down  In the la la la la  Everybody singing like la la la  Next time you poke in your fire  Think of this song  La la la la  No I'm poking the fire  Just ruin his winter ritual  I know  It's not going to be poking  And go la la la  Fuck  Yeah  Poking at a teen  La la la la  They took over his house  La la la la  It was like  Michael Keaton  In Pacific Heights 
[00:53:30]  La la la la  No  Not this song  It sucks  I was trying to express to her  How much you hate this  I was like  Ope loves it  I really do  Loves the song  It's not even a bit  And then hates it  It's hilarious  I know  I know  It's very real  And I really realize now  When you tell me that it's like  La la could be whatever  But  See  He doesn't present it in that way  When he goes  Riding on the la la la la  It's like  No  What do you mean by that?  It's not vague enough  He gets specific 
[00:54:00]  And then  Vagues it up  It's not vague enough  For la la  That's the point  It doesn't matter  No  It doesn't matter  Wait  Do you like the song?  I like this  It's a calm down  It's a calm down  Taking my time  Taking my time on the la la la la  Put it on pause  We'll finish the song  Because I was thinking about this  Because like Jimmy said  I really do love the song  And you hate it  I can't stand it  I had to live in a fantasy world  Growing up  Yeah  And I don't think you had to live  In a fantasy world  As much as you think  Well I did  Like my Christmases 
[00:54:30]  My Christmases  My parents  I gotta do something positive  They always went overboard  For Christmas  But then on the other side of that  We'd find mommy in the kitchen  Crying her eyes out  Because she had shitty Christmases  Growing up  Year after year  After fucking year  Wait  Hold on  On Christmas  On fucking Christmas  You'd have that?  Right in the middle  Of the joy  Of opening all the gifts  So it ruins everyone's Christmas  Where's mom?  I don't know  It would find her somewhere crying  Because you know  She didn't have the proper Christmases  Growing up  And I would look at her  And go  Well at this point 
[00:55:00]  You've had probably 20 really good Christmases  It should be about your kids  And now it's way more than that  Right right  Yeah yeah  So would everybody kind of focus the attention that way?  What do you think?  What do you think?  So now everyone's got to tend to the problem  Instead of having a joyous Christmas  What do you think Jimmy?  It was very confusing  Because on one hand  You saw the gifts that almost were as high as the ceiling  No exaggeration  It would take over the entire living room  And then on the other side of it 
[00:55:30]  You know  What's that?  Here we go  Search for the blue comb  La la la la  What do you think?  So when I hear the la la la la song  I'm living in a fantasy world  Up in the apple tree  La la la la  Penis in the vagina  La la la la la  Scared the little boy  La la la la la  The focus drastically changed  It certainly did  I didn't have a big  A lot of Christmases  As a kid I had a lot 
[00:56:00]  And it was very cool  And very Christmassy  And stuff  And I remember very  Happy joyous Christmases  After like  You know  Dad left  And stuff  Although I do remember  Going over my father's relatives  Because Christmas Eve  Was at my mom's relatives  Which I still go to  And still hang out with them  On Christmas Eve  Christmas Day  Was my father's relatives  In Queens  So we had a drive  Into Queens  And it was just  Everyone was hammered  The men were  Groping the women  That were around  And I barely remember it 
[00:56:30]  As a kid  Everyone was smoking  Smoking  Like crazy  Drinking  Drinking  Yelling  That would always end  In an argument  But Christmases  I kind of remember those  But then after  The divorce and stuff  My mother did a really good job  Of making sure  That we got  Trees and Christmas  Things and presents  But then after  I got pretty much  Thrown out of the house  And had to enter life  I did that so poorly  That I couldn't get  A Christmas tree or anything  So I spent a lot of years  With no Christmas 
[00:57:00]  With like nothing  So now I go overboard  And like completely  Decorate the house  So you went a bunch of years  Without like  Without any Christmas  Caring about Christmas  But you're like myself  Now that you have kids  I don't have kids  Well you know what I mean  Your kids are different  Than my kids  Like my  Oh god  Now that you got kids  In your life  Like myself  Doesn't it  It brings back  The spirit of Christmas  It's all for the children  I do it for the children  I'm talking about my son  And of course  You're talking about 
[00:57:30]  Some of your choices  You make  My girls  Jesus Christ  I do have to say  Because I know my mom  Did as best as she  Oh you're gonna  You're gonna  Oh that's a nice  Little thing you're doing  Fucking therapy  You can fuck yourself  Are the therapists  Always saying that  No no not really  No she's cool  Best  Oh is she gonna  Get in your full  This fucking Thursday  Oh really  I have to cancel therapy today  Actually I'm gonna  Get charged for it  Fuck  Oh  Really  Mine doesn't charge 
[00:58:00]  Mine if I don't  Give her notice  Mine doesn't charge  If I cancel  Two days out  And she can fill the spot  She's fine with that  But if I cancel  Less than two days  And she can't fill it  Really  Yeah it's fair  I'm making a problem  I guess it is  Yeah  She wants to make money  Now  La la la la  She doesn't wanna  Listen to me  La la la la  Babble about trannies  Now  La la la la  Same shit every week  La la la la  I don't know why  I can't stop  La la la la  No eye contact  During sex  La la la la 
[00:58:30]  Holy shit  Oh no  Oh no  Is that true Jimmy  Eye contact  No eye contact  During sex  What the fuck  Yeah  If my cock's getting sucked  Or if I'm being  If someone is  If I'm fucking a girl  And she's telling me  How she'd  She'd rather be fucking  Somebody else  Or something really dirty  Yeah  The dirty connection  Love  There's no like  Passionate look  In the eyes  Paint some eyeballs  On her back  There's nothing for me 
[00:59:00]  Kissing  No kissing during sex  A little bit  That was pretty clever  It was alright  Yeah but it was  It was more  It's more  I can't do it  It just doesn't turn me on  You know like  Making out  Oh stop it  Years ago  My girlfriend  Years ago  Stop it  My girlfriend years ago  Would look at me  While she sucked my cock  With her puppy dog eyes  And I would just be like  Looking down like  What are you  One of the fucking  Hey Alvin  Cut the shit  Trying to boil out  In your mouth  You don't like that  Not when it's an innocent look  When they look up like that  You don't like innocent look 
[00:59:30]  No not  Not when a girlfriend  It's like  I have different  Different things turn me on  Like  Inappropriateness turns me on  Yeah  And a girlfriend looking at me  With my dick in her mouth  Is fine  But inappropriate  Turns a lot of people on  But they also have the other side  You've decided not to have  That other side at all  Oh dude I'm so  I'm lucky my dick works at all  It's literally  My cock is Joe Frazier  At this point  I'm just happy  It's fucking walking  I think  I think most  That's really funny  I think most people  Obviously want some dirty  But they also have 
[01:00:00]  That other side too  You don't have that other side  But I do  But just not during sex  Afterwards I'll lay there  Spoon  Kiss  Hug  I'm fine with that  If I like the girl  I love my girlfriend  So I'm happy doing that  I got a  I got a  You know I have a lot of brothers  And just  Just to back my point up  He writes  Holy crap  I don't want to tell you which one  You're nailing the scenario  Yeah  And if he wants to add to it  Maybe he can write more  It was just  You run downstairs  It was like  Holy shit  There's my new bike  The happiness is everywhere 
[01:00:30]  And then all of a sudden  Who would first notice?  I'm sure we took turns  And like would you say something?  Or like  It was just  Like what would you say  If you walked in  And you're awkwardly playing  With your toys  Like am I supposed to be happy still?  I don't even know  Maybe put on some Bing Crosby  But like you'd walk in there  And if she was upset  Put on some Burl Ives  Would you say what's the matter?  Oh god I did  Way too many years  Merry Christmas  Merry Christmas  Presents 
[01:01:00]  Presents to tree  Presents to tree  Merry Christmas  Lights  Fist and happy  Happy and stuff  Oh mom's crying  Oh  I can understand  If  Well I can't understand  What so ever  Because I think  If bad memories  Are replaced by  So many years  Of good memories  Somewhere in your head  That's gotta translate  Balance out  It has to  No  Why does your brain  Always go back  To the bad memories  Of Christmas  When you've had  Many many years  Of good Christmases 
[01:01:30]  Somebody explain this to me  It's that deep  Psychologically  Why were they  Bad Christmases  I don't know  I don't want to know  It could be an attention thing  I don't know much  About my mom's family  At all  Yeah it could just be  An attention thing  People get overwhelmed  By emotion  They don't know how to  Handle it  Like even good emotion  They don't feel right  Unless everybody's  Rallying around them  Yeah my mom's  This is what I know  I'll give you a quick scenario  My mom's father  Was a raging alcoholic  My mom's mom 
[01:02:00]  I've never called her  My grandma  Was the biggest  Cunt I ever met  In my life  To the point where  My mom  And I give her  This respect  Blew off her own mom  To protect  What this person  Could do to her kids  Oh  Okay  Nice  And I have an aunt  That I haven't seen  In  30 years  That is still alive  Living in Queens  That's her  30 years  Easily  Maybe more  Wow  And she's still alive 
[01:02:30]  Do you want to see her  My mom's just  Why  I don't know anything  About that side  Of the family  I  Can you imagine that  No  I have no  Way to  Think about  Not  Like cutting off  Family members  I  There's not one  Family member  Unless they're dead  That I don't  Know  Keep in touch with  Or  Have a good relationship  I don't know any  That I  Just like  Oh that  Fuck  Fuck  Forget that  I know where she lives 
[01:03:00]  And everything  I've never stopped  Buying nothing  Wow  She's chose to just  Fucking live her life  Without family  That's  Very odd  So I mean  As much as I talk  About my mom and stuff  I feel bad for her too  Because she had it  Pretty fucked up  It was before I had money  You assholes  Right  It was like  The family just comes out  Of the woodwork  No we all love you  Anthony  No it was before  That shit  And then my mom's  Other sister  Who  My mom had a good  Relationship with  Lived in Lowell 
[01:03:30]  Massachusetts  And she  Dressed like  It was 1910  They all do in Lowell  Oh really  Yeah that's  They just haven't  Caught up with the times  That's the look  I think  She had hats  With the fucking  Bird feathers and shit  Like fucking  Lucy hats  That she'd get in  Trouble for buying  And Ricky would  Make her take them back  Yes  Those hats  They're not even hats  Those old dumb hats  That women used to wear  That just  Stuck on the side  Of their head  It didn't even go  On top of their head  It stuck on the side  Of their big  Dumb hairdo  Right  Stupid hats 
[01:04:00]  With nets on them  And fucking  Things  Ribbons  And I haven't talked  About it in a while  And then my dad's  Side of the family  Was all the normal  Shit that most  People could relate to  Normal family shit  You know  Not perfect  But normal family  Normal family stuff  The hell is that hat  Look at the big feather  Coming out of it  With that thing  She would dress like  It was the turn of the century  That looks like  A War of the Worlds  Spaceship on her head  It looks like a screen cap  Of a certain frame 
[01:04:30]  Of the Zapruder film  With a little piece of skull  Is being fucking shot out  Through the front  They loved plumage  On their hats  That's so silly  And little birds  Like you'd walk around  With a little parakeet  Dead stuffed parakeet  On your hat  Oh  My brother  Checking in  Yeah he checked in  Because I asked for more  Talking about the Christmas  Yeah  And I forgot about this  She would cheer up  When she got to burn  All the wrapping paper  Plastic and such  Oh was that like the  Couldn't wait to get to the  Like get it over with 
[01:05:00]  Burn it  Burn the boxes  Burn the nasty  Fucking wrapping paper  And ribbons  Wasn't it the mess  What  She'd find it like  The mess either  Oh no  She  Because kids  Unwrapping gifts  They could make  Quite the mess  It  Turned the living room  Into a sauna  As you're trying to  Enjoy Christmas  Because it was  Burning  Because it was  The wood burning stove  So it got so  Fucking hot  In this one room  Like the engine room  In an old  Cruise liner  Stoke in the ovens 
[01:05:30]  Would somebody come out  And tell the rest  Of the family  That there was a problem  Or how would everybody know  Because there's a lot  Of you guys  Oh I don't know  Maybe it was just  In the air  Oh really  You could just tell  Yeah  Yeah just said  And fast forward  To this past Thanksgiving  It continues  To this day  I guess  She has a new problem  With me  I don't even know  What it is  She didn't even say  Hi to me  At Thanksgiving  That is really  Or even say hi  To her grandson  Odd  It's just these weird 
[01:06:00]  Imagined slights  Who the fuck knows  And a lot of people  Do that  Where they imagine  A lot of people  I notice  Are not comfortable  Unless they're being  Like victimized  Or they're feeling  Persecuted  Or they're feeling  It's like  It's almost like  You know how you get  A feeling in your chest  Like if you see a girl  You like with somebody else  It's like  It's a block in your chest  Oh it's a real  It's a visceral feeling  I like the word visceral  Yes  I know exactly  What Jimmy's talking about  It's a tightness 
[01:06:30]  Do you know  There are some guys  That have never felt that  Good looking guys  Fucking  Guys that  That I hated  In school  But they do  Because for them  It's like my buddy  Like Russ Meneve  For them it's the cops  Showing up after a date rape  Get that feeling  Uh oh  I like the Russ Meneve  By the way  I love Russ  But he doesn't have that thing  We were talking one time  And he goes  Dude I just wish  Like when they break up  I'm like you don't miss them  Or wonder who they're fucking  He goes nah  I wish I did  And I'm like  I admire that so much 
[01:07:00]  In Russ  He just doesn't care  Wow I don't care either  It takes  It takes a little while  Yeah you don't like  The next day  You're like  I don't give a shit  Like  Yeah there's gotta be  A little  There's a buffer period  Where you don't wanna know  What the fuck they're doing  And then after a while  It ends up you know  Whatever  I don't care  Yeah I don't  But there is a buffer period  Where it's like  Don't fucking tell me  I don't wanna know  I don't wanna know  Who they're seeing  What's going on 
[01:07:30]  Yeah  It's heartbreaking  Alright back to the song  La la la la  Oh god no  Oh that's the  That was the part  Pretty good  I'll go back a little bit  I didn't  It's like the first verse  He says it too  Like the first one  Pretty good  Pretty good  La la la la  Pretty good  Taking my time  On the la la la  On the  Don't fall down  In the la la la la  Everybody's singing like  La la la la  Taking all the halls  With the la la la  Making my way

[01:13:00]  Without a little la-la  I was living near the Jews  La-la-la-la  Plugging in my hair  With la-la-la-la  Eating all the blacks  With la-la-la-la  Shooting up my guns  With la-la-la-la  Live from the compound  La-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  Ho ho ho 
[01:13:30]  Ho ho  Three hooahs  A very coomier Christmas  Holy shit  How do you not love them now?  That's great  You gotta love Sherwin now  That's fucking funny  That is so fucking good  I want my own now  I want one, Sherwin.  I want one.  And Jimmy wants one.  No, Jimmy doesn't.  Jimmy, you want a Sleeves Christmas song.  Put on 15 pounds.  La, la, la, la.  Fucking coattail rider now. 
[01:14:00]  La, la, la, la.  Third mic bag of shit.  I'll do it for you.  Miss Bill Burr now.  La, la, la, la.  Wish you were in L.A. taping.  La, la, la.  Fuck that.  I don't need my own.  Wow.  I got to say.  You just made your own.  I know.  I got to say.  I think.  You're a fan now.  You're a fan.  No, no.  I think after all this time, I may have hit a nerve with Sleeves.  I think after all the years of bashing his Christmas song.  I think he's shown that he's got a sense of humor, my friend. 
[01:14:30]  I think I might have hit a nerve.  That la, la, la, la line is classic.  The la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  He la-la the la-las.  Why do you think that he was just getting angry and singing real stuff?  Sorry that you had a bad childhood.  La, la.  Sorry that you hate your own guts now.  La, la, la.  You have a drinking problem.  La, la, la, la.  You're going to be killed drunk driving.  La, la, la.  Hope your gun goes off and kills you.  La, la, la, la.  Hope blacks rape you.  La, la, la, la.  The Jews don't like you either. 
[01:15:00]  He was getting a little real there.  Shitty mustache like Raul Julia.  La, la.  That was just me singing that.  I know.  I'm trying to get rid of it.  I'm slowly going to get down.  I like it.  It's sort of a 30s movie star mustache.  It is.  Well, Jen.  I say pedophile.  You say 30s movie star.  Jen and Eerie writes, sleeves one, ant zero.  What are you talking about?  It's ant 55, sleeves one.  Well, I don't know.  It's been sleeves for years.  La, la, la, la. 
[01:15:30]  That was funny.  It was very funny.  You said mustache?  Very funny.  I can't find the audio yet, but fucking Charles Barkley finally did something we've been saying  for months.  Hitler?  He called out Michael Jordan and his Hitler mustache.  I think it was on Conan?  Yeah.  On Conan last night.  We can't find the clip because it's hard.  Chris Cornell's got one, too, though.  It's hard to find Conan clips online right now.  The only thing they've posted is him talking about Obama.  They haven't posted this shit off.  They haven't posted a Hitler mustache?  Not yet.  If someone's got that and they can send it in, that'd be great.  Give Conan a little promotion. 
[01:16:00]  He needs it from us.  He needs it.  I don't know.  I just wanted to make us sound bigger.  Yay.  Sam, by the way, you got an announcement there?  Oh, good.  Good.  Yes.  I don't know how to seg into this.  That's because it's such a big secret.  Such a big secret.  You guys have no idea what it is.  I don't know.  I don't know if this is rumor and innuendo or if this is actual truth.  Well, I know the work.  The rumor is them dying of a fatal disease.  That's what's been said.  I did hear that and that it was AIDS or sickle cell.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Ron actually asked Fez yesterday if Fez thought I would make it to Christmas.  Aw.  Jesus.  That show's getting morbid.  Well, getting?  Jesus.  You're right.  It's well past the morbid point.  I will say that the announcement is not that I have a fatal disease.  Boo!  No, what do you mean boo?  Wow.  It's a celebratory.  That's, uh...  So you cleared that up.  Yes.  But you know Ron's not going to believe you.  Well, I hope he does. 
[01:17:00]  He's going to run with the fatal disease for a while.  I hope he takes my word for it.  Or at least until Fez starts talking again.  Whatever happens first.  Has Fez not been...  No, he's talking more.  Okay, good, good.  I was just a little joking.  Now Fez's going to be upset.  He's not going to like that.  He's not going to like that?  That's going to hurt feelings.  It was just a little joke.  I actually was listening around Fez and he's talking more.  I don't know.  He's sensitive about certain things, I think.  I can't be around sensitive people anymore.  Well...  I just can't.  He picked the right show to be on.  Yeah.  I got too much fucking shit.  I can't take on more sensitivity from other people. 
[01:17:30]  Sorry, Fezzy.  I love you, though.  He knows that.  He knows in your heart.  I love the Fez.  He knows that.  Anyway, go ahead.  Yes, well...  What is your big announcement?  I thought I should tell you guys before I announce to the world...  Yeah.  ...that, uh...  In person.  No, that's not...  Oh.  Wow, really?  No, we haven't even done the DNA test yet.  Oh.  Oh.  Can you back up?  Yes, I was trying to say that before I announce it to everyone and put it on Twitter...  Okay, fuck it! 
[01:18:00]  What's next?  Well, why wouldn't you just let me finish?  Can I?  Sure.  Thank you.  I was trying to say that before everybody else finds out, I wanted to tell you guys that  Jess and myself are engaged to be married.  Is that Jess?  Yes.  Oh, no.  That's Jess's father.  Because, you know.  Wow.  In person. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Now, we were toying with this idea.  Yes, you were.  That's why I had to bring it here.  For a while, and you denied, denied, denied.  That's me.  Which I see as lied, lied, lied.  I was being coy.  Oh, coy?  Yes.  You were being coy?  I told you just like a week and a half ago that I had no plans.  Yes.  That was a lie.  That was a lie.  That was a lie because you had plans.  Yes.  As a matter of fact, I did.  Now, when did you do this?  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Isn't that a thing you're supposed to do on Christmas? 
[01:19:00]  So you save money on the present?  Well, some people would say that, but at the same time, if you do it on Christmas,  and something should happen to the relationship, that ring is a Christmas gift.  Oh, shit!  Look at this cheap motherfucker!  A lot of women don't want to be engaged on Christmas.  Well, I think they do, if they get to keep the fucking ring.  Well, I let Jess know that, I mean, the ring should hold her over until Christmas and beyond.  And is it because the ring is a family heirloom? 
[01:19:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  It's a brand new ring.  Oh, it is!  Purchased.  And even though, we should mention it, Stephen Singer hooked you up in Philly.  Oh, it was!  I went to my friend on the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Stephen Singer!  That's right.  Which means...  I hate StephenSinger.com.  That's his website.  And he didn't get the ring for free.  No, hell no.  He gets me my ring for free!  And he sucks with a joke.  Which is, store went up in smoke. 
[01:20:00]  And I wish he was positive with HIV.  But just to show you the...  I hate Stephen Singer.  I hope he fucking falls into a rock quarry.  With his rings on.  Ten rings on his fingers.  He's trying to swim out.  He's sinking.  Big diamonds are cutting his own...  I hope he's killed by his own product.  And no one finds him for two months because no one likes him.  Nobody looks for him.  They didn't even notice.  You can do everything on the web so no one notices he's gone.  Yeah.  All they find is bones and they gotta figure out whose bones they are.  What the hell is that?  Hey, how come no one's been clogging the toilet at work? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, wow.  Stupid hasn't come in.  Stupid.  That's what you get, Stephen Singer.  Wow, look at that.  Is it a blood diamond?  I hope so.  I hope not.  I don't think Stephen Singer works with blood diamonds.  Those are the best blood diamonds.  I don't think so.  No, it makes it a little more special.  You gotta hobble a motherfucker.  Keep them on sight.  I do not think it's a blood diamond.  Oh, okay.  Well, you could always hope it is.  Very good question coming in.  By the way, before we beat the shit out of you for a half hour, Greg Hughes would like 
[01:21:00]  to congratulate you, my friend.  Oh, well, when he comes in, maybe he can.  I want to congratulate you.  You had to put that on the record, so when you got home and your wife goes, why would  you do that?  You said, no, I was real for a second.  I said.  I said.  I'm very happy for you guys, but Joey wants to know.  But now that that's out of the way.  Joey wants to know if you spent more on the TV or the ring.  Ah.  And what celebrity chipped in for the ring?  That's a...  I mean, I'd like to find a celebrity to become part-time investor. 
[01:21:30]  Sponsor?  But no, the ring was much, much more expensive than the television.  And I know Danny put up the cheapest engagement ring ever.  It's a very nice ring.  Is it?  Very nice ring.  Is there anything more awkward when someone gets engaged and they show you a ring like  that?  Hey, dude, you don't have to tell me.  You were that guy?  I was not quite that small as the one that we're looking at here.  But it was pretty bad.  It was pretty bad.  You know, I got it at the Penn Station fucking jewelry store. 
[01:22:00]  Of course.  That was in Penn Station on my way up to Massachusetts to propose.  You should have gone to the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Oh, I didn't know it was there.  I had no clue.  My world was very small at that time of my life.  Penn Station.  There's a Penn Station up to fucking Massachusetts.  You couldn't even go to the Diamond District.  No, no.  I was like, because I gave it such little thought.  Yeah.  I'm like, where can I pick it up on the way?  You didn't study up on your four C's? 
[01:22:30]  No, no.  I had a C at home.  I had one C at home and that was plenty.  Well, what did her father say when you asked him for his blessing or permission?  Oh.  Oh, the father that left on Christmas Day.  Why would you bring that up?  Oh.  The father that left on Christmas Day many years prior.  So you can relate to the bad Christmases?  More baggage than the tarmac at Kennedy.  Wow, really Christmas Day, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So you could, hold on.  That was a great job.  You could relate to the Christmas thing.  Thank you.  She probably hated Christmas because of that fact.  I could relate to it if I gave a fuck. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  But I was like, just, hey, I'm going to have fun.  La, la, la, la.  Father left on Christmas.  La, la, la, la.  Anthony pays.  La, la, la, la.  I feel like there's going to be a follow-up to the Anthony Cumiya Christmas Day.  It could be.  I think he's just getting started.  Stay tuned.  He's just warming up.  Dizzy Dean warming up in the bullpen.  No, I saw Sam doesn't make any money, and he got a fucking really nice ring.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  I mean, money was saved and allotted.  Did he have to suck Steven Singer's cock? 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  And he still charged me, which I don't even understand why I did it.  That's why you have to say I hate Steven Singer.  You can't throw fucking young Sam a bone.  I feel like we grew up with this kid, and now he's getting married.  That's crazy.  Hey, Steven Singer runs a business.  He's not a guy that's going to fucking just toss him a ring for free like that.  You started working with us, what, when you were 12, 13?  I was 21.  God, how he grew up so fast.  Wait, can I ask something?  I know how he likes to name things.  Like your TV, what's the new name of your TV? 
[01:24:00]  The Simmons View 6000?  Sure.  Did you name the ring?  No, but I should.  What's wrong with you?  You've got to name the ring.  Yeah.  The mistake.  That's not true.  I wish you kids only the best.  Thank you.  I'm just going off of my own bitterness from my own personal experience with holy matrimony.  Well, I've thought this out, you know, for a long time.  You did?  Yes.  So I believe it is indeed the right decision.  And it's been nothing but happiness since the proposal.  The way this kid talks. 
[01:24:30]  When is the big date?  I don't know yet.  Ah, you're pulling an E-Rock.  No, no, we're not going to.  Yeah, he's pulling an E-Rock.  I've told many people we're not naggling this thing.  You're not going to naggle this?  No, no, this thing isn't going to get naggled out.  You're naggling the shit out of this, aren't you?  No, no, no.  It will be either.  I love how he doesn't know, but Jess knows.  Jess doesn't know.  We've yet to.  Uh-oh.  Oh, because now this is, Opie gets the scoop.  Jess has the easy pass.  Because Jess and Opie's girl talk.  To the day. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, she's got it all figured out.  She's been planning.  Has the planning started already?  It's been discussed.  Discussions have started.  Oh!  It will either be fall 2011, which is soon.  Fall 2011 is, yeah.  Or spring 2012.  Won't be any further than a year and a half.  Spring 2012.  Okay, that's before the end of the world, because that's December 2012.  Okay, all right, okay.  Because you don't want to do it in the winter.  Uh, very important question. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  Prenup.  What are your opinions?  I'm not asking you if you're going to get one.  It makes $12,000.  If you're not, Jess is going to get one.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, Jess would probably be...  Now, let me tell you a little story about a little tin knocker from Long Island that didn't  get a prenup either because he wasn't making a lot of money when he got married.  I love stories.  Yeah.  So, you know who that guy was?  Who?  Stories.  Bob Hope?  No.  Uh, it was me. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  Yes, yes.  But you had to pay so much.  It was Mitch Kumstein.  Yeah.  No, it was...  I, uh, yeah.  I got married.  I wasn't making a lot of money.  Mm-hmm.  Didn't have a prenup.  Why would I get a prenup?  I didn't even know who one was.  And then, uh, I started making some change, as they call it.  But even...  Oh, ooh, that ooh.  Even if you get a prenup after you get married, if you start making money after you're married,  you still probably have to... 
[01:26:30]  No, you can put anything in the prenup.  It's a contract, just like the marriage is.  Put anything in there.  Hey, after we get married, if blah-de-blah happens, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  That's legalese.  Jordan has named your ring.  Oh, good.  The Trap Shutter 3000.  Oh.  Trap Shutter?  The Trap Shutter.  That's not it.  That's a horrible name.  That's not the name of it.  All right, they're trying, though, Sam.  I understand they're trying.  They know you like to name your stuff.  I do like to name things.  You got to tell Ann how you did it.  And how did the phone call go with the father? 
[01:27:00]  Well, I mean, it's an uncomfortable conversation.  Oh, did you have to go through the whole thing?  That's why you got to go with girls.  No dad.  I love the fatherless girls.  Well, you got to do it right.  She has a...  She has indeed...  Indeed has a father.  So you had to do the right thing and ask him.  Yeah, I had to call him and ask for his blessing.  I'm courting your daughter.  I've been courting.  How did that go?  That's gotta be...  Sir, I would like to take your daughter's hand in holy matrimony. 
[01:27:30]  Exactly.  Did he ask one of his slaves to go up and knock on the door?  Oh, God, no.  Think of that, though.  With, you know, background.  Oh, yeah.  A racial background.  How does the father of lily white, a nice lily white girl feel about that?  Well, he gave me his blessing.  I called him.  And I had never called him by his first name, I realized.  Wow.  Because I had never...  I just had to avoid calling him anything.  What did you call him?  I'd just say, hello.  I'd just see him face to face. 
[01:28:00]  Hi, how are you doing?  So you didn't have to say, Mr. So-and-so.  Right, or...  But this time I had to...  Ooh, that's rough.  Use the first name.  Hate dealing with dads.  Yeah.  So you see when they're younger than me.  I called him, yeah.  Where does he live?  Like, what part of the...  Is he in New York?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He lives nearby, but I had to call him because I wasn't going to see him without Jess there.  Why did you go over there?  He was at work.  Oh, shit.  Well, why don't you go to his job?  You sprung that on him at work?  Exactly.  What, you went to his work?  Jesus.  No, I called him.  I called him at work.  Oh, right, right, sorry.  Meanwhile, he's got to fucking put the mop down and fucking the booths that have come 
[01:28:30]  on the floor.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  He doesn't mop up peed booths.  That's not what he does for a little bit.  Of course he does.  You know there's probably somebody out there that had to do exactly what you described.  But I had been dating her for over five years, so it wasn't as bad.  It was a surprise.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what'd you say?  I said, hi, it's Sam.  And he said, hello.  Hello, Sam.  I'd never called him before.  You've never called him? 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  No.  Hello, Sam.  So he had to fucking stop the work he was doing?  I guess so.  It was the call like, hi, it's Sam.  Oh, Sam, you finally called me.  I've been looking at you for five years, you boyish figure.  Finally.  That would be horrible.  But he goes, so what are you doing?  And Sam's like, nothing.  What are you doing?  Just sitting here, just kind of playing a little bit.  Oh, my God. 
[01:29:30]  I bet you, when he was talking to you, he was actually in the break room flogging his  cock.  I don't think so.  He was helicoptering it.  I think.  Helicopter.  I'm almost certain he was working at his desk.  Yeah.  He wants to have sex with his daughter's boyfriend.  La, la, la, la.  Put it in his nappy ass.  La, la, la, la.  Kiss him on his boyish neck.  La, la, la, la.  I'd smell the little Tupperware hair.  La, la, la, la.  I've never gotten those vibes from him.  Never.  Oh, God. 
[01:30:00]  Not even close.  That's good.  Yeah.  And so you said hello.  Yeah, I said.  And traded pleasantries.  I said, I was, I've been meaning to talk to you.  Oh, shit.  Were you sweating?  Were you like all nervous?  I was, there was a stammering and I was like.  When the phone was ringing, were you just like, was your heart beating really fast?  Yeah.  I've been meaning to talk to you.  What?  She won't let me come in her mouth.  What did you tell her when she was a kid?  She won't let me come in her mouth.  Oh, God damn.  I can't even say her name to do that dirty joke. 
[01:30:30]  Of course.  I appreciate you.  You're just not even talking about the real person.  No.  It's radio people we're talking about.  It's just a joke.  Yeah, yeah.  It's characters.  characters.  Yes.  Act like Mr. Amescu.  So there's not much to the phone call?  Well, and then I said, I was hoping or planning, because I wasn't going to say, I am going  to ask Jess.  Yeah.  Because technically, if he didn't give me his blessing, why would I be asking for his  blessing?  Did you practice?  Oh, Wade.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, I want her to be my wife.  Oh, Wade.  Wade, I want her to be my wife, Wade. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, jeez.  Wade?  I want to ask your daughter to marry me.  No, Wade, Wade, Wade.  No, Wade.  Wade.  Wade.  Wade.  It's Jess, Wade.  No, I said, I was hoping.  It's Jess.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  I'm planning on asking Jess to marry me, and I'm hoping that I have your blessing in doing  that.  Dork.  I'm planning on.  Was there silence on the other end of the phone?  Did the phone drop?  No.  Did you hear, did you hear, did you hear this? 
[01:31:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  No?  No.  None of that?  No, none of that.  Maybe a Homer Simpson sound when you asked.  You had that one?  Gregorio.  What happened?  He wasn't paying attention.  That one may be a sound.  Which one?  From Homer.  Homer.  Look what Sam asked.  When I said to Jess's dad, I was planning on asking Jess to marry me and hoping that I 
[01:32:00]  had your blessing.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, which one?  The really good one.  And I would say, like, would you be okay with that if I asked Jess to...  Oh, don't boo me.  Timing's everything, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I asked if he was okay with it.  Yeah, I said, would I have your blessing?  It was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  Oh, no.  No, that's in reference.  That's terrible.  That's horrible. 
[01:32:30]  But he said, well, you do.  When I said I was home.  Gotta go.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism.  Happens every time one of those dancers start poontanging around with those show folk fags.  Show folk fags.  He didn't call me that.  You're not a show folk fag?  No.  So, wait, he said you do, and what did you say?  And I wanted to lighten the mood.  No, she's dead.  That's his answer. 
[01:33:00]  That would have been a...  Slams the phone down.  That would have been such a terrible way to get that news.  That really wouldn't be horrible.  I said...  I was trying to lighten the mood.  Yeah.  So I said, good, because if you...  I said, good, because if you didn't, I would have had to make another plan.  Oh, no, you're trying to make a joke?  What was that?  No, he didn't.  He chuckled.  I would have had to make another plan, which is what?  No, I don't know.  To burn you two alive in your home and take out the life insurance on you so she and I 
[01:33:30]  can elope with your life savings.  And then, I think you heard this on the other end.  Oh, dear Lord, Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This isn't happening.  Yeah.  No, so he gave...  And then we exchanged pleasantries and that was it.  It was a short conversation.  What?  Exchanged pleasantries.  Yeah.  What else did he have to do than stay on the phone with his future son-in-law?  He had to go back to work, I guess.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:34:00]  That's it, man.  Game over, man.  Game over.  I mean, we hung out before.  We know each other.  You know each other?  That's pretty much it?  After five years, you kind of just know each other.  We know each other well.  This is going to be the guy that walks her down the aisle and presents her to you.  We know each other well.  Ah.  And we appreciate each other.  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is she already looking for a dress and everything? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  I mean...  Oh, wow.  How'd you ask her?  Oh, this is on the fast track.  We went out.  She got a Bridal Magazine's Thanksgiving was a Thursday.  Black Friday.  We were out.  The day after Thanksgiving, she was getting a Bridal Magazine.  Same Friday.  She's been waiting for this day.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  She's well prepared.  And moving forward quickly.  Well, she did not see it coming.  She thought I was going to ask her.  What?  Did you have her ring instead of a wrestling magazine?  Yeah.  By the way, all those wrestling magazines and all your wrestling stuff. 
[01:35:00]  I'm gone.  She knows.  Done.  The Bridal Catalog.  Get rid of all the catalogs for cool cars, toys, fun stuff.  Gone.  She knows.  The wrestling isn't going anywhere.  Yeah.  Not yet, but it will.  Right.  Right.  Talk to any married guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The wrestling.  I'll be able to keep my wrestling belt prominently displayed in our mature married person house.  Sam will have his man cave with his fucking pizza rolls and WCW Thunder posters. 
[01:35:30]  Chicken nuggets.  Thunder was a good show, by the way.  Her friends are going to want to come over and see a picture of you at age six with fucking  sit on Hulk's erection.  That fucking nonsense is going into the...  It's going to start slow.  Can I just put one of my pictures here?  Because it's all your stuff up.  Yep.  Can I just take...  That's it.  And then before you know it, that shit's not in your house anymore. 
[01:36:00]  It'll be this.  Gone.  Well, yeah, you're fast forwarding very quickly.  One knee.  Oh, yes.  We, uh...  Traditional.  My family takes a family picture at Thanksgiving.  Of course they do.  To put in the Christmas cards that my mom sent out.  It's just an excuse to have another photo of you.  Yeah, exactly.  Just photoshops everyone else out.  Of course she does.  Mother must have been crying.  She was happy.  Was she crying?  I don't know if she was crying when it actually went down, but then when she...  You retold the story to other people, there were tears.  Oh, God.  We've got to get Bobby on the phone, man.  Our little boy. 
[01:36:30]  I can.  Yes.  He's being taken away by this woman.  No.  I mean, she likes Jess.  She's happy about everything.  Oh, we'll see.  So...  We had a competition officially now.  That is.  We take a picture at Thanksgiving for the Christmas card.  And Jess has never gotten to be in the picture.  That's such a horrible movie.  Who is she?  Fucking Kay Adams and the Godfather?  He couldn't just grab her and bring her in?  Oh, no.  No, no.  She has to sit and watch you take the picture?  What the fuck?  Five years? 
[01:37:00]  She usually even takes the picture herself.  She takes a behind-the-camera role.  I can relate to that.  I was once kicked out of a family photo because I wasn't married to this person.  That's awful.  Why?  Directorial?  Really?  Your pictures are that important?  I would just say I'm not going to leave my chick just sitting there.  It started to get a little more uncomfortable two years ago when my sister was engaged  to her husband now.  But she's been with him technically less time than I've been with Jess.  And since they were engaged, he got in the picture. 
[01:37:30]  Who made that decision?  Mother.  Bobby?  Now, did you ever say to mom, that's a bad sign for Jess because you're not going to  stand up?  They're very traditional.  But that's...  The Roberts are very traditional.  But what's weird is Jess had us stand there awkwardly as they took the only picture at  Thanksgiving every year.  So wait, you're...  You never said to your mom, look, I want Jess in the picture.  Well, it only happened once because the year after we didn't take it and it was kind of... 
[01:38:00]  Everybody was...  I was somewhat surprised.  But no, that...  I just would have called up in front of everybody and said, come on, jump in.  Have Mike take care of it.  But so Jess...  I want to fucking defend his girl.  That's a tough position to be in for Sam, man.  Jess wasn't looking forward really to this year because it's just kind of uncomfortable.  She wasn't like angry, but it was just like weird.  That's terrible.  And so she said, I think your mom's going to have me be in the picture out of sympathy 
[01:38:30]  this year.  And I said, maybe, I don't know.  She said, I don't want to be in the picture out of sympathy.  I said, okay, whatever, I don't care.  Wow.  She's defiant already.  Yeah.  You've got a firecracker there, my friend.  She's got spunk.  Yeah, she does.  So we were all getting ready to take the picture.  And my mom is holding the camera.  And my mom was in on the plan, by the way.  She knew what I was going to do.  And my mom was holding the camera.  And everybody was...  My brother and sister and her husband were starting to set up. 
[01:39:00]  Like, sit down on the stairs.  We were going to sit on the stairs because there's three dogs and six people.  They get in the picture, the things that shit on the rug?  The dogs.  The dogs get in the picture, but not Jess over the years?  Oh, no.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh, God.  And does everyone have a...  What disrespect.  Does everyone have a spot on the stairs because the picture's taken every year?  No, because we move different points in the house.  It's a fucking Americana.  It is.  Exactly.  Norman Rockwell.  Norman Rockwell.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Can't wait till there's a murder in this family.  I don't think he liked painting the portraits of the... 
[01:39:30]  Oh, I know what you're going to say.  Oh, right.  I don't think I ever saw one anymore.  No, I didn't either.  No, he was a racist.  That's some racist shit.  Yeah.  You have to mix the blue and the purple.  He was just lazy.  He didn't want to mix paints.  But, so my mom is holding the camera and Jess says, all right, why don't you let me take  the picture?  Why would your mom take it?  She's in the family.  Yeah.  Well, this is all...  But don't you have a timer on the camera?  What a dumb plan.  That's a dumb plan because then Bobby's not in the family photo. 
[01:40:00]  That's very confusing.  Yeah, what if she's standing under the thing with the hood on...  Yeah.  It was all a grand conspiracy anyway.  Didn't she know that the jig was up?  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, because she figured maybe...  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe my mom was going to set up the camera afterwards or something.  So, she goes...  Jess says, let me take it.  And she tries to get the camera from my mom.  Uh-oh.  But she said my mom had a death grip on it and would not release the camera and said,  no, no, no, Jess, why don't you get in the penis?  On your penis?  No, not on my penis. 
[01:40:30]  See, because she's very attached to you.  I know, but not in that way.  Oh, okay.  Not in that way.  Death grip on his penis.  Poor little Samuel.  I know.  How many times has that penis been angrily pinched?  No.  Zero.  Why are we related?  Know it.  Zero.  All right.  Oh, okay.  So then she says...  Gotta give a number.  It's so wrong.  She says, Jess, do you want...  I want you get in the picture.  You get in the picture.  And she goes, okay.  And then she walked in front of everybody. 
[01:41:00]  She goes, see what you did, Sam?  And I was like, okay, I'm creating some awkwardness here.  So everybody's looking at Jess.  So the attention's on her.  Uh-huh.  And I said, well, do you want to be in the picture?  And she said, I'll be in the picture.  And then I said, would it make you more comfortable if...  And then I got down on one knee.  And then what did she do?  She freaked out.  She said, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And she left the room.  She walked out of the room on you. 
[01:41:30]  Because he's like, I was just going to eat your pussy.  What's the problem?  In front of everyone.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  That's how you get initiated into the family.  You sit on the steps while the dogs are there.  And you lick her pussy.  What?  That's wrong.  That's not true.  That's a great way to bring someone to the family.  Oh, shit.  I mean, it is interesting, but it's not...  So wait, you say you got out of your...  And she goes, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And she left the room.  And then she came back.  And by that time, I took the ring and the box out of my pocket. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  And then I opened it.  And she went, no, no.  And she was like, are you really doing this?  And she put her hands over her face.  And she was crying.  I could understand that.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Well, out of joy.  Really?  I think so.  Getting into his family, it reminds me of fucking Rosemary's Baby.  The creepy vibe that Ruth Gordon and her husband had.  And then I asked her if she would marry me.  How'd you say it?  I said, will you marry me?  And through the tears and the shaky voice and the snot bubbles. 
[01:42:30]  She said, are you really asking me that?  Are you really asking me...  There were no snot bubbles.  She said, are you really asking me that?  Are you really asking me that?  She said, no.  And I said, yes.  And she said, yes.  Oh, and she said, yes.  And then I stood up and gave her a hug.  And I was still holding the ring.  And I just handed it to her in the box.  You know, you're supposed to put it on.  That's what she told me.  And she said, put it on.  And I told her.  Oh, God.  So I put it on.  And then she's already given orders.  And then she freaked out and started hugging everybody else in the room.  Really?  But they were all a little disappointed that Sammy's growing up because it makes them feel older. 
[01:43:00]  So they gave her kind of ice hugs.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're taking a little boy away.  No, they gave her the handshake hugs.  Like, where they gave her, like, the fucking, you shake hands and clap the back.  Yeah, kind of like, hey, how you doing?  You can meet up with your bro.  They were all very happy.  And then my dad opened a bottle of 1966.  Buttermilk.  Dom Perignon.  Buttermilk.  Buttermilk from the 1960s.  He doesn't have to.  He doesn't have to celebrate.  And I bet you that the big toast your father made when I told you he's not a queer. 
[01:43:30]  1966.  1966 bottle of Dom?  That's right.  Where do you have that?  In the garage.  Does that shit age well?  Ed, you know anything about that?  I don't know.  I just know Dom is good.  But I usually have stuff.  I don't think I've ever had stuff, like, earlier than...  Does that shit age?  Like wine?  I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, he said...  Like, the 90s now.  It's very valuable.  I can get some from the 90s.  Back in the 80s, I had some from, like, you know, the 70s.  1966.  That's 66 now? 
[01:44:00]  That's...  Oh.  He's probably had it since then.  That's right?  Of course.  What was he...  Did he...  You think he stashed that away?  Do you think...  He probably bought it.  He actually bought it and stashed it for that occasion when their little boy is going to  get married, knowing that that fucking bottle was there.  Dude, do the math.  44 years ago.  He probably...  17 years before he was even born.  That's how planned his whole life has been.  I'm sorry.  He probably bought it in the 70s.  All right, I got you now.  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  And then put it in the garage.  In the garage.  In the garage. 
[01:44:30]  And then chilled it up.  Yeah.  And then spread it by the fucking chock full of dust can of nails.  Your fucking...  I know.  Your marriage proposal, wine.  Yeah, the garage hasn't gotten hot over the years.  Half jars of paint.  Oh, it's awful.  Get me that special box.  It's behind the WD-40.  I'm a lawnmower.  You're behind the lawnmower.  It's got mulch on it.  You shitty wine.  Champagne.  Whatever it is.  Champagne goes bad after two weeks.  Two weeks.  Fuck, Don.  Anything you want to add before we say hi to Bobby, who's on the line? 
[01:45:00]  I don't know, unless you have any questions.  I think that's the story.  I think it's nice.  It's a beautiful thing.  I think it did.  Regardless of some of the...  I think you did it properly.  A little tradition there.  Yes.  And, yeah, right on.  And Jess is still very happy.  She texted me, even yesterday, saying how great the ring was, how great the proposal was.  Will you be happy?  It's only been a few days.  Very happy or something.  I don't want to fast forward too quickly here, but will there be big people food at the wedding? 
[01:45:30]  At the reception?  Good question.  Because you don't eat meat, and everybody has a meat choice.  A little steak.  A little steak, chicken, or fish.  Are you telling me this is going to be just chicken, chicken, chicken?  There'll be some chicken.  Chicken nuggets.  What else do you eat?  You eat, like, kid food?  Well, I mean, pizza big time.  Dude, everyone else is going to have a plate of big boy food, and then they're going to  hand you a plate of kid food, right?  No, it's okay, though, because the reception is at Chuck E. Cheese.  That's not true.  That's what we heard.  We haven't even booked a venue. 
[01:46:00]  You two are going to jump in the ball pit.  It's going to be great.  Did you, after, like, later that night, did you, you know...  There was a celebration.  Oh!  Yeah?  Was it very loving?  Yes.  Did you say, I love you, I love you, and...  While the celebration was happening?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Not over and over.  Or maybe, maybe it was...  How about as you were spraying confetti on the sheets of the legs?  I don't know what that means.  If you propose, it's called confetti, right?  Confetti!  Honeymoon at WrestleMania. 
[01:46:30]  I would love that honeymoon.  Oh, God, Jesus.  No, stop it.  It should be...  Jess is not going to tolerate a goof wedding.  No, of course she's not.  No, I think Sam's a little traditional.  You want a traditional wedding, right?  Yeah, but I also told her I wanted to get married at the Rawway Rec Center in New Jersey  in a Jersey All-Pro wrestling ring.  So she's a little...  She said, even though you're joking, I'm mad right now.  Yeah, the idea of it made her angry.  Yes.  Very mad.  Just the idea.  And are you serious about that?  Not 100%, but it would work in the Rawway Rec Center. 
[01:47:00]  Let's do it.  Oh, God.  That's wild.  All right, let's say hi to Bobby.  Sam's mom, Bobby, everyone.  You're on the air.  You're on the air, Bobby.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, Sam's mom.  Hi, how are you guys doing?  Very good.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Because, you know...  We're all extremely happy.  See?  The mom gets congratulations.  Way more happier than when your daughter goes, right?  No, actually, it's really the same happiness. 
[01:47:30]  Equal, wow.  Exactly, 100%.  All right, I understand you have to play it one way on the radio, but we know the truth.  Sam is your special kid.  The go-to guy.  Not special that way, just, you know.  Huh?  But Jess is really special, too.  She's a fan of Jess.  She's a terrific girl.  Yeah, yeah.  How did Sam tell you that he was going to ask Jess, because he said you were in on  the whole thing, so what did he say to you?  Well, he'd been thinking about it for a while, and when he first brought up the subject, 
[01:48:00]  he said, you know, I'm saving a little money, because, you know, I'm thinking before long,  I'm going to have to invest in some jewelry.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes.  Prince Albert.  Yes.  And then...  Nice little piercing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, right. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  I thought she was going to have a nice phone call with the boys today.  It's such a special time for you.  It really is.  Let's try to keep it on.  I know.  Keep it on.  Keep it on.  I know.  Thanks, guys.  So she goes, thanks, guys.  Yeah.  As in, I would really appreciate it.  Yeah.  So Sam says he's got to buy some jewelry.  He thought so, yes.  And then he decided it would be a good time to ask for it Thanksgiving 
[01:49:00]  because, you know, that's when we always take our family Christmas photo  that goes in our family Christmas.  And I've got to cut in here.  Did you ever feel bad leaving Jesse out of the family photo?  Well, after the first couple of years, I felt a little bad.  So why didn't you have the capability of saying, like, hey, let's bring her in.  She has ultimate power.  Yeah, you're like the matriarch.  And do you understand, like, nowadays it's Photoshop,  so as long as she's on the outside of the picture, you could have got rid of her? 
[01:49:30]  Shop her out.  So you didn't hurt any feelings?  No, no, because she knew the rule from the very first Christmas.  Rules?  You had to be in the family to be in the Christmas family picture.  And until Sam made it official, you know, part of it was, you know,  it had to be official, and then that made it more special to be in the family picture.  She was trying to throw it back on me by doing that scene.  Yeah, yeah, I saw what she did there.  That's passing the buck. 
[01:50:00]  That was your fault.  My fault.  For not...  No, no, we never had any of my daughter's, you know, boyfriends in the picture until she was engaged.  And, you know, that's just the family thing.  That's just what we were doing, and that made it really kind of fun.  Well, I like...  I had the camera out.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Bobby.  I like to compare your wonderful Norman Rockwell life to mine.  And if you walk through my old family house, it's just a bunch of broken relationships in family photos. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, my God.  My mother and Sal at their house, just taking down frames all the time.  I would open the back, dump that.  That's tragic.  Remember that one?  Remember that disaster?  Yeah.  You don't know what you're missing.  But anyway, okay, so it was time for the family photo this year.  But, you know, but Jess has been taking it for the last, like, you know, four years, five years or something.  Taking the picture. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, take...  I...  I thought that...  I'm sorry.  Oh, Bob, you know what Anthony was talking about there.  I misunderstood that.  I thought your son was...  You know, whatever.  So, yeah, she's been taking the picture.  Yeah.  So, this year, I had the camera out, and she reached over and took it out of my hand and said...  Tried to.  No, she didn't take it out of my hand, and she said, okay, I'll take the picture.  So, I said to her, oh, Jess, it would really be neat if you would be in the picture this year.  She said, oh, no, no, I can't.  No. 
[01:51:30]  I know the rules.  Yeah, I know my place.  There's a lot of pressure in this family.  There is.  It's a real family.  And I said, no, you could.  I mean, you really could.  No, she said, no, no, really, I can't.  And at that point, Sam just stepped in and did his thing.  His thing.  He stepped in.  Proposed.  He stepped in and said, Jess, would you really like to be in the picture?  That's what he said.  Yeah, we know.  We heard this whole story that you're telling. 
[01:52:00]  You're just reiterating what Sam had said, but that's okay.  From a different perspective.  He's your little boy.  So, Sam said that, and what did Jess do?  And Jess said, well, yeah, but...  And then he took the ring out and went down on one knee.  Who's one knee?  That's no one's name.  It's an Indian friend.  That's not nice.  That's not nice. 
[01:52:30]  I love it.  You guys crack yourselves up, don't you?  Crack yourselves up.  That was one knee.  That's not.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  This is so wrong.  This is a very special moment for Bobby and Sam.  Yeah.  She's losing her little boy.  And I'm sure Jess is listening.  Yeah.  She doesn't like some of the comments you've made. 
[01:53:00]  I would imagine.  I wouldn't think so.  Sam, I'm trying.  I really don't.  Well, I know, but...  The one knee thing.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  There's nobody named one knee.  You knew that.  And I did know that.  I'm sorry, Sue.  You knew that.  And Bobby, I did know that.  You knew that.  That was uncalled for in this very special time.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  You guys do know that I only live to give you these lines.  Yes.  Yes.  We thank you for that. 
[01:53:30]  So now, how do you feel about, like, you're not losing your son, but he is moving on.  It's a big step.  Yeah.  Do you think?  Yeah, he's found a new mommy.  That's not the case.  Oh, boy.  Jess is not filling that role.  She does not want to hear that.  You're not safe at around, Jess.  I'm sorry.  Jess will be very upset if you say that.  I have a question.  Bobby, I know you like to save little things of Sam's.  Was there anything you scooped up from the big event and put in a Tupperware?  Oh, that's a good question. 
[01:54:00]  I'm afraid to hear that.  No, no.  It's not in Tupperware.  Because I took the camera back then, so I just started clicking pictures of Sam doing  the proposal.  But you didn't collect anything?  Some old, I don't know, the plate Sam was eating on that day?  Or off of nothing?  Oh, no, no, no.  Nothing like that.  No, I'm not as bad as you guys think.  Am I, Sam?  You saved his afro in Tupperware. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that was unusual.  There you go.  Oh, no, and the baby teeth in the freezer.  I told him that you had baby teeth in the freezer.  Yeah, well, those aren't all his.  I think some belong to my daughter and my sister.  Wow, Jesus.  Neighborhood children who are rivals that were murdered.  I think Bobby's a serial killer.  I think anybody who ever beat Sam in a competition wound up missing. 
[01:55:00]  No, I'm really, really happy.  This is a fantastic thing.  Oh, yes, I'm sorry, yes.  I'm very happy for Sam.  Are you planning things now already with Jess?  Has she called you and asked for advice, things like that?  Well, we've talked a little bit.  Oh, you know what that talk is.  It's going to be my way.  Jess and her mom are going to do this thing.  Oh, you're not going to muddle?  Only if they ask me to do anything, I'll be happy to do it. 
[01:55:30]  Because, you know, traditionally the bride and the bride's mom,  they really love when the groom's mom gets involved in what the bride is going to be doing.  Yeah, I know.  They love it.  I know.  That's usually a real good thing, yeah.  Oh, I meant metal, right?  Not muddle.  Muddle.  I don't muddle either.  I'm being chastised.  Bobby, before it gets really ugly, we're very happy for Sam.  Yes, we are.  Yes, yes.  I know you guys are.  I know that it's all just, you know.  I know that all... 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Oh, you hung up on my mom.  You hung up on his mom.  All right already, Sam's mom.  On a happy day like that?  That's going to...  She's going to pretend to laugh it off, but inside it'll hurt.  It'll hurt.  She thought she was above that.  She's heard it happened to other people.  Just make sure your mom doesn't talk about her aching back when you're having the fucking  mother-son dance.  Why?  Whose mom would do that?  I don't know.  Oh, the mother-son dance.  I don't know.  Wait, during the mother...  Why would you make it about your son? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, no.  Why would you?  Why?  During the mother-son dance.  Oh, no.  Why would you when you can talk about your aching back?  Oh, no.  Why would you?  During the mother-son dance?  Why would you?  Her back hurt.  Why would you talk about the moment?  Whose day is it?  I mean, it's...  Yeah, whose day is it?  Exactly.  And what would you say?  What would that son have said, whoever that was?  Well, if you look at the wedding video, Jimmy, you'll see me through clenched teeth going,  Now?  You're going to talk about that now?  Hey, really? 
[01:57:00]  Right now?  At least it was a memorable, special dance.  But you said that?  Yes.  You're going to talk about that right now?  Seriously?  Can we talk about that later?  But it was just like, what, my back hurts?  Mm-hmm.  I can't...  Was it like, I just can't do this?  My back hurts?  Isn't that a time to, you know, take the pain?  She could do it.  Take the pain!  Even if it hurt, though, you don't say it.  Yeah.  It's a special time.  Yeah!  You just go like, this is very wonderful, congratulations.  It's that... 
[01:57:30]  It's sort of almost that last little before you're married, mother-son kind of talk.  You're alone there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Way to go, kiddo.  Maybe a little memory, a little story, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember.  I remember.  I know what you've been through the last few years.  Very special song is playing.  Yeah.  I don't even know what song it was.  Did you enjoy the dance, though?  Like, I mean, like, after the back line, like, you're like, let's not talk about this  now.  What did you guys talk about? 
[01:58:00]  No?  There was no other conversation?  No, huh?  It was just quiet?  I miss my dad.  Oh!  Oh!  I miss him.  Just...  Sam, very happy for you.  Tumbleweeds going across the dance floor.  Well, dude, dude, did you...  But don't worry, she had her chance to tell me, you know, what she thought of the wedding  two months later.  Did she like it?  Oh.  It was fun. 
[01:58:30]  I loved it.  Yeah, it was a great time.  Oh, oh, here's a good...  Did she see the candy table?  Well, I didn't.  It was good.  It's always good to know that the one person that didn't like your wedding was your mom.  Oh.  That'll...  That'll...  That'll stay with you for a while.  Yeah.  Boy.  You're much nicer than I am.  Literally the only person.  Did she take a picture in the photo booth?  I don't know.  That was fun.  It's not about me, Sam.  I'm really sorry.  That's okay.  I shouldn't have done that there.  Very happy for you and Jess. 
[01:59:00]  Well, who's getting invited from work?  As we know from the Nagel wedding, the Nagel nuptials, a lot of controversy about the invitation  list.  Yeah.  Well, a lot of snubs.  Yeah, there were some.  I'm just blatantly calling them snubs.  There were some.  So, is it going to be like this Friday morning when Borgata tickets go on sale?  Oh!  You think I forgot that?  Another gala event.  Why would it be like that?  It's a comedy show.  You know what?  January 15th, the second show. 
[01:59:30]  It's the Saturday night show added.  Me, Attell, Burr, and Brewer.  Borgata, Atlantic City.  First one sold out in 30 hours.  I want to go to that.  Can I go?  It's a great show.  Yes, you should.  Tickets go on sale this Friday morning to AM.  Can I hang the whole weekend?  Of course.  Oh, all right.  It's probably not going to be anything like that.  Is it in the plans?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Very cool.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I don't be there.  Well, listen.  Hell yeah.  We should take a break.  Magic Bob is here.  I know.  Magic Bob.  And Bob Saget.  And successful Bob.  Yes.  Sam, obviously, we're very happy, and there's more to come as far as Sam and the wedding. 
[02:00:00]  I want to know what kind of wedding.  I want to know who you're inviting, who you're not inviting.  I can't wait.  Where the honeymoon's going to be.  Who's one knee?  That and the Prince Albert line, which is to his mother.  That was my mom.  I know.  She's a sweet lady, and she's got a great sense of humor.  Bob Saget and Magic Bob next.  Open Anthony Mornings, Ron and Fez, Middays, on The Virus, Sirius XM.  What happened? 
[02:00:30]  The rock was panicking.  Why?  The music's playing.  It goes, relax.  We got it.  We're back.  We're back.  It's like, I heard the music because it's blasting to the headphones, and so I knew we 
[02:01:00]  were back.  Yeah.  But sometimes the music can play.  People are not going to be like, what happened?  I was trying to...  I hear music.  I was trying to tweet a picture of Bob Saget and Magic Bob.  Everybody just hanging during the break.  I'm shocked over Magic Bob.  That is his name.  I mean, it's Magic Bob now.  I'm actually...  Magic Bob isn't here yet.  He's coming.  Oh.  I'm Bob Kelly, the comedian.  Bob Kelly's here.  How are you doing?  When does Magic Bob make his appearance?  Well, first, I would like to...  You know, there's a lot of good stuff we have to talk about. 
[02:01:30]  Bob's new show, Bob Saget's new show is amazing.  Yeah, Strange Days on A&E.  Maybe Magic Bob could do a thing.  Maybe Bob wants to learn about magic someday, and he'll do one of the shows.  More than I can even tell you.  Do you spin around and become Magic Bob?  Oh, I'm not Magic Bob.  Oh, Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly will come in.  You'll see.  He'll come in.  Yeah, that's Bob Kelly.  Can he pull a coin out of my ass or anything?  Well, he can actually put a cigarette through a coin.  Oh, that's right.  What happens with my ass?  Nothing?  No.  I didn't see that.  Not right now.  I'll put fingers in it during the trick.  Oh, perfect.  I could be the puppet during that. 
[02:02:00]  You can watch half an index finger disappear.  Oh, that's my favorite trick.  It really was.  Me and my girl had Thanksgiving at Bob's house, and it was very good.  The food was great.  Right.  And then Magic Bob showed up and just wooed everybody.  Oh, really?  He was amazing.  With his wizardry.  I can't wait for Magic Bob.  I can't wait for Magic Bob.  Wizardry.  It was pure wizardry.  Most of the tricks, I mean, one or two, backfire.  You've got to redo them, but that's part of every great magician.  You've got to learn.  How many tricks does Magic Bob have? 
[02:02:30]  I do.  It's two.  Two?  Yeah, you said a few backfire.  That means a lot of backfire.  I think there's three or four.  Maybe three or four.  I don't know.  He's working on a big, it's an illusion.  They're big.  They're big.  You're working on an illusion.  That's not a trick.  Yeah, they're not tricks, guys.  They're illusions.  There's stream magicians that just do street stuff, and then there's illusionists that do the big productions.  Can you make Ozzy's birthday gifts disappear?  Because they're still here.  They're transporting them to Ozzy's house.  The fucking funniest video I've ever seen. 
[02:03:00]  David Copperfield could not make these disappear.  Jesus Christ.  Bobby, you know what happened, right?  Dude, I watched that video in a cab last night, howling by myself.  It's hysterical.  I felt bad, though, because it's so big.  Everyone did.  Bob Saget, in front of you, you'll see four Beatles books.  They're 90 pounds.  They weigh 18 pounds.  We weighed them.  Right.  And Jimmy got those for Ozzy's birthday yesterday, and I don't know what happened, but they're still here.  He will not be able to lift these.  I'll tell you what happened.  It's karma.  Because, first of all, Jim has never bought me any gift ever, and I bought him a gift one year, and he actually told me to hold it. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, you know what?  You're right.  Two years.  That's a good point.  That actually is karma.  Two years.  I literally hand him a gift, and I go, hey, man, I got you a gift.  Oh, thanks, man.  That's cool.  It wrapped in everything.  He goes, dude, can you hold on to this?  I got to go down and do a spot.  By the way, I got you guys a gift for Christmas one year.  I got you something for the two of you.  I don't remember what it was, but I did.  Oh, you got us that rock thing.  Oh, that was actually pretty nice.  What was it?  It was rocks.  No.  It was candles. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, it was candles?  Candles with rocks.  It was actually very nice, yeah, for the apartment.  Candles with rocks.  Sorry, Bob Saget.  They go out or something.  No, this was actually my favorite moment of my life.  Jim and Bob and discussing the gifts they bought each other and Thanksgiving.  You pass it over to Bob?  A little something for his birthday.  Give me a little 20 for you.  Give me a 20 spot.  When was your birthday?  October 8th.  Wow.  I'll give you 10, then.  Magic Bob would like that.  Me and Jim, were you sick Thanksgiving night? 
[02:04:30]  Dude, I literally ate so much at his house.  Right.  The food was amazing.  I wasn't there, though.  That's the truth.  I don't want to blow it for people.  Bob Saget was not there.  Unfortunately.  I wanted to be.  Magic Bob was there.  Right.  Magic Bob.  And I ate so much.  I'm like, I said to my girlfriend, my girlfriend, he would have to go downstairs and shit.  Everybody shit.  I'm like, I'm going to go throw up.  I ate so much.  It's the biggest plumbing day.  It's a giant plumber's day that day because everybody shits at the same time.  Everyone shits.  Are you serious?  In closet toilet?  No, not that.  I thought the next day it would be.  Dude, I dropped a fucking deuce. 
[02:05:00]  It's the first time in my relationship I've called my girlfriend in to look at my shit.  I've never done that.  In my house?  No, in my house.  It was fucking, it went all the way in the ball and then snaked out mightily.  It really did.  Fucking Sean Connery should have been powering it.  I woke up in the middle of the night.  That was beautiful.  I woke up in the middle of the night and threw up in my mouth.  Like, I woke up and I just...  Did you have to dodge?  Did you have to dodge to catch that?  I actually swall.  Did you try to, is it like, you know, throwing a little cup up in a ball in a cup? 
[02:05:30]  I swall.  I just took a Tums and went back to bed.  I didn't even go to the bathroom.  I was like, fuck it.  I got on a plane the next morning and I shit three days later.  I did not, I did not shut up my Thanksgiving until the road was over.  Came out and hit the, like a nickel?  I did a gig in Vancouver.  It just went further back into my heart.  And then on the next day I did Seattle and it became part of my ribs.  International shit.  And then I came back.  International.  They scanned me and they said, you have to shit.  What is it about flying?  You can't shit for a couple days afterwards.  All the air.  Because I'm afraid of all this shit. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know what that's about.  If you're on a long flight and you take a sleeping pill, if you do something stupid,  you shit yourself.  So you don't want to do that.  You don't want to do that.  How great would that be to clear out first class?  Did you see that though?  Bob Saget shit cell phone plane.  You know what?  I should just do it.  It just sounds great.  Do it.  Do it.  Would you like to see that on TMZ?  Yeah.  You know what I'll do?  I'll twit before I shit.  Oh, there you go.  I'll put it right out there.  I'll say, I'm about to shit.  That's what just happened.  Sand.  Can we get some business out of the way?  Bob Saget has a new show on A&E called Strange Days.  This is before Magic Bob makes his big appearance. 
[02:06:30]  I want to say I've seen the first two episodes and I'm loving this show.  Thank you.  I spent a year on it.  Really?  Yeah, I'm that bad.  And if I saw the first two episodes.  Other people could have done it in weeks.  If I saw the first two episodes and didn't like it, I would just make believe I didn't see  the episodes.  Yeah, you would.  I've known you a long time.  You liked One Versus 100 when I did.  I did.  I said that earlier, too.  I know.  You told me that.  And you laugh every time I say that because I think you didn't even like it.  I didn't understand it.  But I liked it.  My girlfriend was watching it with me and she said, I liked this show. 
[02:07:00]  I liked this show.  I don't know what happened with that one.  I forgot I did it.  There's awful game shows on all the time.  Yeah, there's awful everything.  And I thought it was all right.  But the gist of the new show.  The gist of the new show is I studied subcultures.  Originally, I had an idea to sleep over anybody's house I wanted and just go in.  That was like 12 years ago.  And it just didn't happen.  It didn't get bought.  I really worked hard on it.  And then 10 years later, came back, thought about it, talked to this guy, Scott Lanker  at A&E, this wonderful guy, picked it up on the phone and said, yeah, let's do this  with these guys from Tijuana that do Obsessed and do a bunch of other shows. 
[02:07:30]  And then this Brillstein Entertainment Company.  Let me name all the companies involved.  I want to thank a man of Radar Rage.  Radar Rage.  I don't know.  Motorola for the first phone I ever got.  But then we went and did this thing where we wanted to see, I guess, documentary comedy  is what I'm calling it.  I'm calling it Cockumentary.  Ah, there you go.  So I don't want it to be reality.  As long as it's not a rom-com.  Unless it's cock reality.  Rom-com. 
[02:08:00]  What is a rom-com?  Oh, romantic comedy.  Oh, really?  For the rom-com.  We hate romantic comedies.  Yeah.  And it said rom-com yesterday made us all laugh.  They don't make that many of them anymore.  Thank God.  Really?  Well, Jennifer Aniston's in most of them.  Yeah, yeah.  So anyway, this show is the one that aired last night.  I looked for Bigfoot.  That was the later one that aired.  I really did go into the Pacific Northwest with infrared gear.  And we kind of found something.  You know, there are howling people.  They go up, they get pretty wasted, and go look for Bigfoot.  And go look for Bigfoot. 
[02:08:30]  But were there any signs of Bigfoot?  My whole theory on it is that he has a tiny penis, and that he has big feet.  If you have big feet, they assume your penis is gigantic.  And he's just embarrassed.  He's embarrassed, so he's in hiding.  So he hides.  But then they say there's women and teenager Sasquatches.  So I guess they're all embarrassed by their penises.  Yeah, they would have to be, like, a bunch of different sizes.  Well, the females will be Sasquants.  They're afraid of their late-night queefing.  Hey, obviously there's kooks wherever you go, but do they believe in general? 
[02:09:00]  That's racist, dude.  Do they believe in general?  In the Pacific Northwest, do they believe in general that there might be a Bigfoot thing happening?  The people that I talked to, you saw the thing, so I can tell you.  In the beginning, we interviewed some Native Americans from that area.  And they really said that they're people, that we've seen them.  And they were telling me stuff off camera that they've seen them mating with.  There are folklore stories of them mating with people, with humans.  Did they mention that when they were in a peyote-induced? 
[02:09:30]  They were, like, one of those hot things where they sweat for three days.  Yeah, the Sweat Lodge.  Yeah, the Sweat Lodge, and they see spirits.  Dream Quest.  No, they're not dropping shrooms.  They handed over Manhattan for $8 in a fucking shiny thing.  But maybe if Bigfoot exists, they can make a couple bucks.  But our problem is they've never found one.  They've never found a dead one.  They found one last year, but it was actually just a pig in a Bigfoot coaster.  It was at Soup Plantation.  I was with them, and as we're driving past the lake, the guy goes, 
[02:10:00]  Oh, the Loch Ness Monster's in there.  I'm like, wait a second.  Don't give me, you know, how good is the weed up there?  Where's Magic Bob hiding?  Is that their little jokes?  Like, uh-huh, uh-huh.  We got a sense of humor about it.  I'll be really honest about it, because they're maybe listening.  They're really funny guys.  Yeah.  They're characters.  I liked them.  I really did.  There's a guy, Bobo, really funny guy.  We have a Bobo on this show, so I laughed when I saw your Bobo.  The Bobo in the Pacific Northwest was like,  I used to fucking hate you, man.  Your comedy sucked.  Now I like you.  I'm like, wow. 
[02:10:30]  That's a brutal.  Am I still complicated?  Yeah.  Complimented?  Yeah, was that a backhanded compliment?  It was kind of.  But then he told me how much he loved Sam Kennison,  and we went off on that for a while, so I don't know.  You should use this line I use.  I'll say to somebody, tell me how you really feel.  Oh, jeez.  That'll get him.  They'll go, I saw you last night.  You'll have been on TV.  They'll go, I saw you last night.  And then they don't say anything.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, that's an insult.  And they're like, what?  Yes, thanks.  Yes, saw you.  I saw you.  So you went deep into the woods. 
[02:11:00]  We went very fast and camped out.  Yeah, we did.  To try to find a Bigfoot.  And then we went back.  We went back.  In the afternoon, we dropped down salmon and apples and donuts.  That's what this dude said.  I don't want to talk about that.  I wasn't sure what you want to talk about with the episodes.  They baited the trap for Bigfoot.  Right.  And they went to the local, I don't know, like fucking 7-Eleven, whatever it's called  up there.  How do they know what Bigfoot's like?  And there's donuts, salmon, and apples or something.  And I asked if Bigfoot is a Jew.  And he said, absolutely not.  And then we left it and we went back at two in the morning with infrared shit. 
[02:11:30]  And I was scared to go back.  Because then you thought bears.  You thought about other animals.  Forget about Bigfoot.  How about the bears?  How about the real animals?  You're out there with a Sony recorder.  You know what would have been great if what attracts Bigfoot is scat porn?  Like if that's what finally got him there.  A guy farted.  A guy farted into a parabolic mic.  And I said, what if that is what attracts him?  Yeah.  That's like a sonar sound.  How is it?  It picks up.  Hold on one second.  I'm just going to leave this here.  Okay.  Sorry. 
[02:12:00]  What the fuck?  The freaking Dead Sea Scrolls.  Next Tuesday, just to finish this off so you don't have to do it all day.  Because you're overly gracious to me always.  Next Tuesday, I join a frat at Cornell on A&E.  That's the first one.  Marshmallows up the ass?  All the way with a skewer.  Happy birthday to me.  A little bit of hazing.  A little date rape?  A little date rape.  I raped myself.  A little homoerotic activity?  A little bit?  I poked a hole in the Bed Bath & Beyond Toga. 
[02:12:30]  And you're a brother.  Frats are a little.  And then the second one, I joined wrestling.  Lucha Libre wrestling.  Oh, the Mexican?  Yeah.  The hooded stuff.  And I spoke phonetic Spanish off of cards.  And I did backyard wrestling and Dragon Gate.  And we had Rowdy Roddy Piper come on.  He's cool.  The show is really good, Bob.  I hope so.  I worked hard on it.  Did the bike episode air last night?  Yeah, it did.  Joining the biker gang?  It did.  That was scary.  It really was.  What were they called?  The Iron Order.  And they're a big organization. 
[02:13:00]  I did the Warner Theater in Washington a couple months ago.  A hundred of them came strong to it.  And they brought their bikes.  So people were a little bit skeptical.  Oh, Jesus.  And I came out on stage.  And Bob.  And I said, who the fuck are we?  And they went, Iron Fucking Order.  And the audience was like, okay.  It's like, what now?  What is Bob doing now?  They're my friends.  I'm Sidecar.  They named me Sidecar.  He was in a Sidecar riding with these guys.  How many days did you spend?  Five.  Five days with the biker gang.  Every episode, 60 hours of shooting. 
[02:13:30]  I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.  And it's fun, though, you know?  Yeah.  And he was in a Sidecar for many, many hours on the road.  That's a cool shot, actually.  With the biker gang.  That's taken out with your iPhone, right?  No.  That was taken by the A&E guy.  But I showed footage for my iPhone.  It's the poster to the fucking show.  Yeah.  It says, Bob, he's laughing at you, Jimmy.  It says, Bob does America one culture at a time.  Is that from your iPhone?  It's that my iPhone does graphics.  It's the promotional poster.  My iPhones do billboards.  It's the new professional PR app. 
[02:14:00]  My head is airbrushed.  I do want to say it.  I said it off air, and I want to say it on air, because I think it's kind of important.  The biker episode, what I liked about it.  I mean, Bob Saget is hilarious, and the jokes are there in this show.  But in the biker episode, it got real serious.  And I saw you break down.  You were crying.  I was pissed at myself in editing.  I would just go.  You're like, fuck, why did I cry through this?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  It was pretty intense.  It was real, though.  If the episode aired, we could talk about it. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  The kid lost his, not his dad, but I like his dad.  He was very close to this guy, his uncle, basically.  And I go and meet this kid, Lil Killer.  And I get concerned when you put kids on TV, because I've just had a weird career anyway,  and I want people to be okay and not ruin kids' lives.  And this kid just watched himself on TV crying and bawling and just saying, you know, he's  in a better place now.  And I loved him.  Well, you went to the memorial for the guy who was killed by a drunk driver, by the way.  There was someone else in the organization that we lost, too, like after we shot. 
[02:15:00]  So they actually told me about it.  My producers, we keep in touch with the different people that we've been doing our things with,  because we're not out to haze anybody or to lower people and to make people, you know.  We're not there to deify people either, but we're not there to go out and go, hey, look  at these morons, you know.  We're just trying to show it and have some fun with it.  That's what we do.  And get to know it.  It's our job.  You do both.  You do everything.  You go all over the place.  I hear you guys go out.  I know.  I'm telling you what you do.  Let me come on as a guest and tell you what you've done for 57 years.  Could you please? 
[02:15:30]  I have no idea what Seth has been doing here.  You guys are sometimes very thoughtful.  Here's a book.  Thank you.  It's a very lovely gift.  Take this, Fentance.  I bought you this Encyclopedia Botanica collection.  Are you nervous that the biker gang is going to call you up and say, hey, Bob, we're going  to be doing something and we need your help.  I do think I'm going to hear from them again.  I have heard from them.  They actually watched the show.  We had a production assistant go down there and show it to them four times.  Really?  And they released her. 
[02:16:00]  They let her come back to L.A.  You wanted to make sure they were okay with the episode.  I wanted them to be okay with it.  Because they were way more serious about it than Bob Saget was.  Well, and I was, they were tongue and cheek about it, but they were also like, this is  a real thing, Bob.  Yeah.  This is serious.  Don't fuck around, Bob.  And I told you before we came on the air that the guy, Izod, who was in charge of the  whole thing, I kept going, you are the grand, the grand, and I didn't know what to  say.  Oh, shit.  The grand poofah.  It's all dangerous territory.  Yeah.  And he goes, I am the, uh, the, the MC, you know, I'm the master of the, I don't know  what he was saying, but, uh, I was trying to just stop. 
[02:16:30]  He's the main guy.  He's the main guy.  And other guys are holding, you know, I don't want to get killed.  And then he kept going to me.  That ain't right, Bob, which was my last HBO special.  He goes, I like your comedy, Bob.  That ain't right.  He just kept saying that off camera the whole time.  You're good, good.  You smile.  That is not right, sir.  What about, um, what about, uh, Naked Dave, I think?  Yeah.  Guy came up.  He just walks around naked?  Naked.  One guy's named Cooter.  One guy's Peckerwood.  Mm-hmm.  Stiffy.  Uh, Naked Dave is just a naked guy.  And we scrambled the signal for A&E. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And won't turn away.  People do turn.  And women take their boobs out a lot.  So there were women flashing.  I actually showed this woman's, uh, uh, breasts.  And it's, uh, the narration was, I'm proud of it.  It said, we did not scramble the signal for this.  We did not blur the signal.  That's what it looks like.  They're all right.  Yes.  What are you looking up right now?  Just, uh, something on Facebook.  Does it have, uh, friends?  Are you looking at friends?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And how many friends do you have?  Do you talk about it?  Very few.  I'm 300-something.  Only mostly people.  Oh, those are your personal life?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  My other one has got 300-something.  Right.  I have a fan site.  Do you just ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore?  I don't know people, yeah.  Yeah.  I've gotten to that point where I just ignore.  Well, if you can block somebody on Twitter, if they go someone like, you're a hunk of shit,  I want you to die.  It's like, wait a second, in high school, if you were walking past somebody, if you could  just delete them, we were talking about that, Bob.  Delete the whole person, yeah.  Nothing better than blocking somebody.  Wait, Bob Saget even blocks people?  Well, who are you on Twitter?  You just, Bob Saget, Bob would destroy it.  I just don't do negative energy.  And I don't always go through it all. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, I can't, if I'm having a good day, it's a ton of people.  I just won't, I don't want to do negative.  I got enough negative.  I'm my own worst critic.  I know what's wrong with me.  I know when I'm not funny.  I don't want to think so bad.  We all know about ourselves.  You don't have to tell us.  I'll do it if it's a guy that started the account, just tell me to go fuck myself.  That's a little, uh...  What's your Twitter name?  Under my own name.  Oh, is it just Bob Saget?  Oh.  One more, okay.  I like my Twitter. 
[02:18:30]  I like it a lot, actually.  One more thing.  They had you drinking some heavy shit, man.  Yeah, one of them was like a moonshine, really strong, crazy.  I mean, it burned my inside.  It burned on the way in.  Well, the show I did that has not aired, but if we get a good rating, and we'll know around  noon today, that's how this lovely business I live in, you know our ratings, right?  Right.  How life works.  And then we'll know again next week.  We blew it, because we could have got people psyched on our end for the show.  I thought it was airing tonight.  It already aired yesterday.  We could have pumped this up yesterday for you.  Get people watching. 
[02:19:00]  I would have liked that.  Well, you're doing it now.  Tuesday night's an important night.  Right.  The 7th.  But the first episode I shot, we went to Ukraine, and I got guys mail-order brides.  I went to Ukraine for a week.  That's the real deal, huh?  Didn't have a relationship.  I went there, and they are beautiful.  The joke, which I really can't do many places, is that the age...  I did it on Conan.  I can't do it many places.  Is it in Ukraine, the age of consent is yes?  I saw a girl.  I mean, I see people, and they're like, oh, wow, that's an attractive girl. 
[02:19:30]  And she's like, she's 15, man.  I'm like, let's go away.  What are you doing?  Oh, no, that's all fine.  What's all fine?  That's fucking terrible.  It's terrible.  When is this air?  Yeah.  What's the number?  What airline flies there?  What airline goes to the Ukraine?  Oh, it's to the street airlines.  Is that it?  I'm having a flight right now.  Is it a shitty country?  It's a flansky air.  Yeah, is it shitty?  It is, you know, the Odessa steps, the baby carriage goes down the steps, and Woody Allen  did a takeoff of it. 
[02:20:00]  That's where I was.  I was staying off of the Odessa steps.  I was in Odessa.  So what mail order brides, they, obviously, you go online and find one, but...  Yeah, so you pay for each email.  That's how the business works.  You pay to talk to them.  They pay.  Every time you get one, you pay.  How much?  I guess a couple bucks.  So there's thousands of dollars being made into hundreds of thousands.  I don't know if they're making millions, but there was money being spent.  Dude, it has to be fucking just hot chicks working for them.  That's what it was.  I want this to air, because they walk into an agency, and it looks like the agency could 
[02:20:30]  be gone the next day.  Sure.  And it's all beautiful velvet curtains and young girls everywhere.  And I keep going, what's behind this door?  More hot girls?  And I hadn't slept.  And I'm just looking at everything.  What a scam, though.  Like the Matrix.  It was a scam, because they're not going to give up the girl right away.  They're going to make you do a lot of emailing.  And once you get a date, you get to go on a date with her.  So these guys, these four guys we took, you know, poor guy Steve, you know, this one  has to air, because it's really interesting to watch them. 
[02:21:00]  So what happened?  Did you go to the Ukraine?  I went there, and I came back, and I didn't hook up with anybody.  I don't know what people all said.  Oh, you.  Oh, your reputation.  I'm not that guy.  You're more that guy than I am.  And I'm not.  I'm a relationship kind of guy.  So the guy went on a date with her.  What happened?  Was it good or bad?  It was pretty good.  They don't consummate.  They can't throw and tell the people.  Of course not.  They're probably agency girls.  And they signed the thing.  And I'm sure there's a lot of...  Rape?  Side money.  There's a lot of hookery. 
[02:21:30]  A lot of hookery.  Half the people that you would meet, I think, would be in the hookery dickery doc business.  You're right.  And then the other half are just people seeking a husband that would get them a visa so they  could come to them.  Are they pretty some of them?  Yeah, a lot of them are pretty.  It's usually, from what I've seen anyway, desperate guys, they grab these girls up because  it's hotter than anything they would ever get.  And two-thirds of them are dead.  And then they just leave.  Yeah, but they're hot, but they're like Ukraine hot.  They get like a German shepherd mole, and like three teeth are black around the gums. 
[02:22:00]  German shepherd mole.  You know what I mean?  It's like...  Oh, fuck.  They're smoking from a distance, but then when you get close up, you're like, ah, Jesus.  She looks like a dude.  She wants to come here so she can get her dry sock ever prepared.  She's got like a huge, thick hair growing off her Adam's apple.  You can see it at the strip clubs, man.  They got a lot of...  Oh, we were at a strip club in L.A., one of those Ukraine bitches.  She did a turnaround with her asshole, and she had like a fucking berry hanging out of 
[02:22:30]  her asshole.  Oh, God.  Shit or a...  No, it was not.  It was like a fucking...  Just a berry.  It was like a mole, but a purpley, big, red berry.  Did you flick at it?  No, I threw it.  Dude, I puke.  I see that shit.  You got to get on a crane to see it.  You try to slip a dollar...  A mauve and berry?  You try to slip a dollar between that and whatever part of her body is next to it?  Everybody, you could see her turn, and as she turned, the face is just turned.  Oh, yeah.  Just, oh, what the fuck is...  And you couldn't help but go, what the fuck's in your ass? 
[02:23:00]  You know it's a long thing hanging out of a woman's ass if it slaps four guys.  Like the three snooges?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, damn.  Wow.  So the Ukrainian girls...  Ukrainian girls are hip.  They come over, if the guy does buy them, like, what do they cost?  Well, it's not a marriage...  They get married.  I mean, they would want to get married, so they would...  Wow.  And they stay in contact, and some of the girls are very nice, and it got awkward.  I mean, it's all awkward.  It's awkward if you're dating somebody.  Yeah, right? 
[02:23:30]  Imagine you go there, and they know that you want to bring them home.  But they're not really called mail order.  You know, they're women that go to a social.  You go to a disco in the afternoon, and you have your pick of all the...  We go to disco.  That is what...  It is very...  We go to disco.  We go to two sexy guys.  How long do you think those marriages last, though?  Do you think any of them are actually good?  Yeah.  I was told a couple of them last forever, because they want that...  I don't want to say misogynist, but the women really...  Two-thirds of the guys in Ukraine died.  What, during a war or something?  During the war, and before Cold War...  Well, in 95, they lifted the Iron Curtain there, so every war. 
[02:24:00]  And, you know, they didn't even have gas in the country, so they didn't have toilet paper.  And the guys just left and smoked and cheated on them, or bad men ran away.  You know, like America.  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  So they like American guys?  Love American guys.  Don't they get to come...  They'll come here for a while, live with you for a while, and then they...  Like, look, I get to leave now.  And then they figure it out.  After a few years.  They've got a film career, some of them.  A film career?  Yeah.  Some of them figure it out, though, don't they?  Like, hey, I could maybe get the divorce, get the money, and leave with this man. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I think they do stay with you for a while, though.  I just want to do a Bullwinkle cartoon in my mind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moose and Squirrel.  Moose and Squirrel.  Moose and Squirrel.  I'm Maddie Bodice.  Watch me pull a bride out of my head.  How do you remember that voice?  Magic Bullwinkle.  Yeah, Bullwinkle.  So, now you...  That's something.  Wait, wait.  You get one of these girls, you bring them home.  Fuck, I can't comprehend that.  Yeah, it is.  Is there a language?  They speak English?  You can't? 
[02:25:00]  No, but they speak English.  It's the same shit you do all the time, you see if you get to keep them.  That's the worst part, though, right?  He can't comprehend the bringing them home part.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What if they have small pussy lips?  What if?  Yeah.  I don't think they're all, uh, gigantically down below.  I don't think it's all...  I like a big pussy lip.  You do?  Yeah.  How big?  Like a mom's...  A little too big, Bobby.  Yeah.  You should be able to see it from across the street in a dress.  Jesus. 
[02:25:30]  Again, in the strip clubs, though, I've seen Russian girls.  I don't know if they're known for their puffy...  They're not.  Puffy pussy lips.  Do you really honestly like a woman with large...  Fuck, yeah.  Big...  Big...  Big...  Big slits.  He likes the big clit.  Big pussy.  Is it because you're, like, walking out of a curtain before you go on or something?  No, I just like a big...  Is it like a punching bag?  Is it, like, working out at the gym?  I like when she's wearing tight panties and you can see the outline and the bulge.  Oh, I know this.  Like that right there.  Actually, I know this five minutes of you.  But I really mean it.  Like, that's kind of hot.  Any of the...  How is that hot? 
[02:26:00]  How is it not?  It looks like a...  What is falling out of her?  It looks like a Muppet male.  It looks like her pussy got into a fight.  Is that a baby elbow?  What is that?  A baby elbow.  I love it, man.  It looks like something ended at the knuckle.  Wow, that's a...  I love a nice big vag.  That's what Jimmy's into, yeah.  Love it.  How about this one?  I like long, fat lips.  So would you like to put your penis into another penis?  No, I don't like the...  Oh, God damn.  Look at that.  I'll tell you.  It's probably too big.  Oh, God.  Probably too big?  That's not real.  Jimmy likes a pussy that looks like frame 313 of the Zapruder film. 
[02:26:30]  What that is, that's what they do.  They suction puff it.  I don't like that at all.  That looks like an alien from Battlestar Galactica.  Yeah, that's not it.  That's an exposed brain.  I like a natural fat pussy, not a puff.  Do you like to watch surgery?  What turns you on the most, that or eye surgery?  Bobby's giving eye surgery on TV.  Don't you turn it on?  You can't watch that.  Why would you watch that?  Why?  It's someone watching you.  Yeah, while they're getting surgery.  While they're getting surgery.  Bob Kelly's giving our computer a lot of viruses right now. 
[02:27:00]  He's cooking on should we be back?  He's got E.T.  Bob Kelly is six seconds from jerking off right now.  The picture I just saw.  That one looks dead.  Oh, God.  What is wrong with that one?  Let me see it.  That looks...  That did its grooming with a weed whacker.  Yeah, and a little infection it looks like.  That's dry socket.  Look at it.  It's got a very dry socket in there.  It looks like a knife wound that healed in prison.  Guys, may I make a declaration that it's at least seven minutes until we plug my show 
[02:27:30]  again?  Yes.  Just because of where we're at.  Because of the content now.  You don't want to be separated from this?  Please.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's timing.  I'm waiting for the arrival of Magic Bob.  When is Magic Bob going to be here?  I think Roland actually was on the phone with him this morning, or his people.  His peeps.  Yeah, he's coming.  He's...  Oh, what the hell was that?  That fetticoat slap a junction on someone.  That looks like my dick after I've been in a pool all day.  I like that a lot. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, no way.  That would bulge out and snuff a lump like us.  You want a nipple with a hole in it?  That's what you want?  That's it.  That's disgusting.  It looks like a cigar unraveling.  That looks like someone that comes off a goat.  Right?  It does look like a shitty Cuban.  I wouldn't know what to do with that if you telestrated it.  It's the worst.  I don't know.  Anyway, so next Tuesday, it's a really good episode.  All right.  Next Tuesday.  Oh, you want to go back to Strange Days?  See you next Tuesday.  I'm telling you, I think our listeners would love Strange Days with Bob Saget on A&E every 
[02:28:30]  Tuesday night.  I really do.  Thank you.  What are some of the other episodes?  The one coming up Tuesday, I joined this frat.  The second one is...  I actually...  The wrestling thing, backyard wrestling, is pretty severe.  You know, people just kick the shit out of each other.  And some of those guys want to make it hurt a little bit, right?  They want to make it hurt, and they want to actually go into the big leagues.  They want to go into, like, WWE.  No, I mean, they want to hurt you.  They didn't...  Yeah, but I didn't get into that whole thing.  Remember when they did that to Belzer?  They turned him upside down?  Oh, yeah.  We just talked about that again on our show.  I used to watch Andy Kaufman in the main room of the Comedy Store when he wrestled women. 
[02:29:00]  And pissed off so many women.  And he was doing it because it was an experience for him to do it.  And a fetish, probably, too.  It was.  It was a fetish.  And he got hurt.  He really got hurt.  Did you know Kaufman?  Yeah, but now, I didn't know him.  You know, I'd be next to him.  You know, I'd sit next to him.  I'd watched everything he did.  He's one of my favorites.  He was one of the...  I actually hosted a special on NBC with Mary Lou Henner and Rodney Dangerfield and Lily Tomlin about him.  And it was like...  Because I was obsessed with him.  I just...  Because he used to watch him all the time.  Did you...  And his manager, George Shapiro, I loved. 
[02:29:30]  Bob Zemuda, his old friend.  Yeah.  I met Bob in here recently.  It's fascinating.  And he's able to do the Kaufman stuff like nobody.  Because he was the guy that was there to shepherd the whole thing.  Did you ever see when he would do Clifton, I heard...  Leno said he got him to break Clifton character once.  Like, on the way to a gig or something.  Or he got Andy to admit he was...  It was something.  They were in the car and Jay said something like,  Yeah, someone's saying that you stole that from them.  Or someone is saying that you stole that.  And he goes, No, I didn't like...  But he got him to break.  Oh, it was Andy within the makeup? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was either that or he got him to admit...  Jay got him to admit something by saying that somebody accused him of stealing it.  So he actually got it out of him.  Yeah, because Andy would play it all the way.  Never...  What was amazing was when Andy died,  Bob Zemuda did a benefit at the Comedy Store and I was at it.  And I was...  You know, everybody for a second went,  Is that Andy?  Because Bob literally summoned the spirit to do it.  And he started singing...  It was an American Cancer Society benefit.  And he said, This is a travesty.  The American Cancer people put all that money in their pockets.  This is bullshit.  And people started walking out, which is what Tony Clifton would do. 
[02:30:30]  Of course.  So in true Tony Clifton form, Bob Zemuda was walking people.  And as they're leaving, he's going, Fuck you people.  And you know what?  Fuck this.  And I don't care about cancer.  I don't care about anything.  This is all bullshit.  And he threw the mic down.  And then he goes back and he picks it up.  He goes, I can't do that to you people.  Hit it.  And that's Life Start's plan.  And he sings.  And then he does that.  And then he does that another 45 minutes after that.  But he does the famous thing that Andy Coffin jeoparded.  That I'm sure that Bob had a lot to do with. 
[02:31:00]  But he sings at the end of That's Life.  He goes, I'll roll myself up in a great big ball.  And die.  And they bring out the clock.  The time's longest note ever held.  Johnny Mathis, 1962.  And die.  And they run the loop of the voice like a buzzer.  And he's just standing on stage with his mouth open without any sound coming out.  But they're playing.  And it goes two minutes.  Two and a half minutes.  And the audience is like, what is this?  How long is this going to go?  It was like three minutes. 
[02:31:30]  And then he goes.  He does a big flourish at the end.  It was the best thing.  One of the best things I'd ever seen.  And the saddest part is that Andy Coffin, we lost him.  Yeah.  That he wasn't there.  I was pissed off.  And Leslie Nielsen died.  I'm like.  Because I jumped into all this press to promote my show.  And then people would always throw.  They always throw what happens that day or two before.  And they're like.  And oh, happy about your show.  But what about Leslie Nielsen?  And I'm like.  Well, I love Leslie Nielsen.  He was on the video show once. 
[02:32:00]  And he came out with that fart thing.  Oh, he loved that fart thing.  He loved that little fart thing.  God.  He used that all the time.  He would squeeze it.  And then he would just make a face.  Because his whole thing was reacting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did react, right?  You're right.  Reaction.  Almost like silent film.  But was able to do the voice of.  Yeah.  We deadpan.  I don't like when funny people die.  I like when really non-funny people die.  It's easier.  I won't be disappointed when anyone in this room goes.  Do you know Ozzy Box?  No.  Do you know Ozzy Box? 
[02:32:30]  I met him.  I don't know him.  No.  Why?  Are you going to bring him the books?  Can you give these to him?  I know Jack.  Can you give these?  It's actually the only one I haven't met, actually.  Books are just a really good guy.  I like them.  He's a really good guy.  He's a good friend of a friend of mine.  Why did you buy such big, heavy books?  And why so many of them?  We're confused by the whole thing.  I haven't seen books in years.  I know.  Why did you even know what they are?  Well, let's fit on my iPad because he's a Beatles fan.  It's like a tablet.  These are all great big Beatles books with photos in them.  The one book's 10 years old, Bob. 
[02:33:00]  I didn't know that was 10.  That's the only one he had, the one Bob's holding.  The other one's he loved.  It's wrapped in plastic that is melting off of the book.  The book, the plastic will disintegrate if you leave it out.  It's really cool.  You hazmatted this book.  Look at that.  It's ripping apart.  That was probably Ozzy's eagerness.  I can't believe this book even has barcode on it.  Are you bringing these to Madison Square Garden?  No, but I may have Sharon.  I may just hand them to Sharon and have her give them to Ozzy.  Can you bring these to your husband?  Nobody wants to carry around 80 pounds of books. 
[02:33:30]  I was kidding.  Toomey makes a bad one.  I wouldn't hand these to his wife.  I hand them to his wife.  Could you give these to Ozzy?  Why all of a sudden in this absurd room did everybody get literal?  Why would you hand those to Sharon?  For Pete's sake.  Because you gave them to Ozzy.  Yeah, but Ozzy, he loves the Beatles.  He would look at it.  These are all like cool photo books.  If someone gave me a Sabbath book, I would love it, man.  Yeah, one.  Well, yeah, but four is better.  I tell you the best.  Do you love Black Sabbath?  Want to hear how I was honored? 
[02:34:00]  It's about me.  I had to turn it narcissistic.  That's fine.  During Halloween, someone came out with a cover band called Bob Sageth.  Oh, wow.  And BJ Novak tweeted it to me.  Do you want to see my thing?  Can we hear the band, maybe?  I don't know.  Do you have a website or anything?  No, I don't have it.  Bob Sageth.  I guess it really isn't anything.  If Bob Kelly wasn't at the helm over there.  Hear the joke and then see the JPEG.  All I see is porno.  Nothing.  I got it.  I got it.  Just nipples and clits.  That's all that's in here.  Oh, carpet samples. 
[02:34:30]  I twittered you, Bob.  Oh, well, I've been redecorating.  Did you?  Yes.  I'll get you my Bob Sageth.  I had nothing to do with it.  It was just sent to me by a friend.  But you bring it up.  I'm just going through my iPhone list.  Oh, it's all John Stamos.  John Stamos.  My mother.  That's a rooster.  Oh, that's nice.  Why would you...  You've never done nothing with an animal, right?  I mean, don't think.  Just answer.  I've known you a long time.  An animal.  You just...  Have you ever done anything with an animal?  No.  The only thing I ever did with an animal is when I was a kid, my cat, John, I was like 
[02:35:00]  11 and I had to fart, so I held his little head behind me and I actually felt his nose  touch my asshole and I went...  On his nose.  What did the poor little fella do?  Yeah, he kept trying to back up.  His little cat head was trying to pull out of my...  He shit himself.  Because he knew it wasn't good.  It was about to happen.  But no, animals do nothing for me.  I'm not sexy.  I know.  I ask them.  I beg them.  They do nothing.  I wrote a song in my stand-up.  My dog licked my balls and people sing it with me from my special. 
[02:35:30]  They like that.  I'm still looking for somebody to find it.  Jesus.  How many photos do you have in there?  Bobby.  Let me see.  Hundreds, thousands.  Bob, let me see.  What?  We found the cover band, Bob.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  There it is.  I don't do gay porn.  You're straight, right?  No.  Not all the time.  I'm married.  What's the name of that?  What's that?  It's always weird when you hang with a dude and he's your buddy, he's your bro, you go  to war with him and all of a sudden he's just showing you pictures of cocks  and mouths with guys.  Yes.  Guys blowing guys.  Welcome to the O&A show. 
[02:36:00]  That's all they do.  No, I know.  I'm sitting here with Jeff Ross.  You made me look at two girls in a cup and we sat there for 25 minutes.  That was normal.  And it was a three-minute video.  Is Magic Bob here?  I like Magic Bob.  Magic Bob is about, yeah.  Should we take a break and get Magic Bob in here?  Let's do that.  Yeah, we're going to set up the studio at the party.  Time is ticking by.  All right.  Hey, Bob.  Mr. Saget, you staying with us or what?  Yeah, I'd love to.  All right.  Bob Saget in studio.  I'm not impressed, but I don't want to do anything but this.  Thank you.  The new show is Strange Days with Bob Saget. 
[02:36:30]  They're saying Thursdays.  No, Tuesdays.  Jesus.  Tuesday.  Nice printing.  Nice intern.  All right.  Yeah, what are you doing?  No, Tuesdays, 10 o'clock, and then another one at 10.30.  Two first runs, and then 9 o'clock and 9.30 Central.  And then somebody has told me that Mountain is 8 o'clock, and I don't know what that means.  That's very confusing.  Isn't that weird?  We're talking to the whole country.  Mountain.  Just check out A&E, Strange Days with Bob Saget, every Tuesday night, okay?  Thank you.  Magic Bob next.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  The Sirius XM. 
[02:37:00]  Bob Saget in studio.  All they needed was computers.  That's right.  Real fast, Strange Days with Bob Saget, once again, on A&E, every Tuesday night.  Depending on where you live, it's a little different.  So check out your TV there and watch Strange Days. 
[02:37:30]  10 and 10.30, and then 9 and 9.30, and then I think in Paraguay, it's on at 4 in the afternoon.  Nice.  The ex-Nazis are in Argentina listening to it.  It's why I send them copies.  Oh, that's never an ex-Nazi.  No, that's true.  Once you're a Nazi, it's like, you know, being a Marine.  What was I thinking?  You're always a Marine.  Ex-Nazi.  True commitment.  Like, all of a sudden, they're just like, oh, I love the Jews.  Possible future episode.  Well, we thought about a possible future episode of Strange Days.  I don't want to be skinned.  Doing the subculture thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Skinning is, I'll ride a bike.  They can dump beer on me, but I don't want my skin to be slowly cored off of me. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  With that said, has someone suggested one, and you're like, come on, I'm not doing that.  Was there one that you said no to?  That's the biker one.  Oh, really?  And Bigfoot.  And they talk to you, too.  I want to go to, what's the cool festival, Burning Man.  Burning Man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just asked somebody about that.  What exactly is it?  People drop drugs, and then they go and light things in effigy and rock and roll concert.  A lot of nudity.  A lot of nudity.  They burn furniture and giant, you know. 
[02:38:30]  But if you get hurt there, you're fucked, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, people die there and stuff.  You're a copter in.  Sounds good for me.  How far is it from civilization?  It's upstate New York, isn't it?  No, Arizona.  Oh, that's a desert.  We're around the desert.  Oh, no wonder we didn't catch it.  Yeah.  Running around fucking...  We had a whole crew.  We're going to the wrong place.  Yeah, here in Kingston.  Carmen Santiago.  We're the opposite of the Travel Channel.  We go to the wrong place.  Set our GPS for opposite thing. 
[02:39:00]  How big is that, Danny?  How big is the man they burn?  Well, that...  How big is the man?  I don't know if it changes, but I mean, this is particularly large.  How big?  I mean, 20 feet?  I don't know.  I'm just looking at images.  Some of them that are like 50 feet tall.  I mean, here's some scale for you.  Well, it's a very good reference there.  Terry Gilliam movie.  Very good.  Thank you.  He was the one that came in with that movie, The Doctor or whatever.  The Imaginarium of Dr. Panas.  Ah, yes, yes, yes. 
[02:39:30]  He did Brazil and...  There you go, Jamie.  Wow, my God.  There's a way of filming his movies.  That's a big man.  That's a big burning man.  That's a really good sandwich.  It's good, right?  Cool.  It cost me six bucks.  If that was a picture of one of those clits that you like, I'd throw this up right now.  It's a burning bush.  Sam, are we ready for Magic Bob?  Magic Bob is like counting his cards or something.  That's Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly's setting up the tricks for Magic Bob.  You're a road manager?  Oh, Bob Kelly helps out Magic Bob. 
[02:40:00]  There's three Bobs in the studio today.  It's very confusing.  Magic Bob is in the building.  Where is Magic Bob?  He's signed in.  His assistant and him just showed up.  Yeah.  His assistant.  He has assistants, but unlike hack magicians, he has a young, topless voice.  I was an assistant.  Oh, my God.  I've known you a long time, Bob.  Am I talking to Bob Kelly?  This is Bob Kelly, dude.  How you doing, man?  Hi, what's up, brother?  Dude. 
[02:40:30]  This whole thing.  I mean, you show me gay porn and stuff and young male assistants.  That's not me.  That's Magic Bob.  I would never do that, Bob.  You're saying that young Magic Bob is...  I'm married, bro.  I'm not really a fan of Magic Bob.  No, but you show me two guys going down on each other on the web.  You're really bad.  I'm just asking.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, what's wrong with looking at a lucky devil?  Actually, there's nothing wrong with that, but...  What's wrong with looking at three lucky devils?  The one in the middle is always the luckiest.  I never looked at you being fascinated by it like that, like three guys with balls and mouth  and on each other.  Yeah.  No, I'm not. 
[02:41:00]  You're not into it, per se.  No, no.  Not per se.  But you should, but I got up in the morning and...  Not per se.  Cocky.  So you were just...  That was for my viewage.  That was for you.  Right.  As a favor, because I hadn't seen you in a little while.  Right.  I was like, hey, buddy.  Yeah.  I was like a handshake.  How about that road trip one day?  That'd be a great...  I could bring my laptop.  I got lots of pictures.  We should do that one time.  Just me, you, and Norton take a photo like that.  Like, you're in the middle.  I'm sucking your cock.  Jim's fucking...  And then we just...  Like Christmas card.  For jokes. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you know what?  As a goof.  You know...  As a goof.  Now...  I get it now.  What you were driving at.  Bob Saget.  Bob, it's only fair, Mr. Saget, that we show you the greatest gay picture ever now.  What is that?  See, Danny even knows.  I don't...  He knows.  You want to see the greatest gay picture ever?  It's actually not that graphic.  If we're talking about gay pictures, you might as well see the greatest gay picture ever.  No, I don't.  No, because there's...  Thumbs up.  Yes, Danny.  Bob Saget, the greatest gay picture ever.  I would always say my name right before you show... 
[02:42:00]  Bob Saget?  I know, yes.  Because there's Magic Bob, Bob Kelly...  It's a guy who's going to have his head up his own ass or something, right?  No, no.  It's not that bad, really.  Oh, Christ.  The greatest gay picture ever.  No, I can't look at that.  Why do you guys do that to me?  I'm just eating a sandwich.  They're all older gentlemen.  Of course, it's the lemon party.  Yeah, I'm just dumb enough to eat Jim Norton's sandwich.  They named it Lemon Party.  What?  It's called Lemon Party.  Do you like the fact that the guy has this fucking hairdo like Claudius Caesar?  I like the fact that the...  Now, who's the guy that's the less gay in that picture?  That's Frank and Eleanor Roosevelt. 
[02:42:30]  Who's not Eleanor?  William Howard Taft.  Yeah, and the other mother of our country.  I would think the dead guy lying down with a heart on would be the least gay.  That could be anyone at this point.  But he's kissing.  Who's the least gay guy in that picture, Bob Saget?  Can I tell you what you guys have done for me today?  He doesn't want to really go.  I am leaving here.  He doesn't want to go with this.  Okay, I'll play.  All right, you're going to play?  All right, back to the picture.  I'll play.  Back to the picture.  And one of the guys does look like Arnold Palmer. 
[02:43:00]  Yay!  Who are those three?  Yay, what's your win?  I'm looking at the TV.  Nothing good on there.  Yes, there was.  Apparently...  Now look at real television.  I want to go back to the old man gay porn picture.  Oh, he's pulling it up.  Apparently Bob Saget.  Bob Saget was at the...  Was it on The View?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was.  And that is, I believe, George W. Bush.  Yes, he does look like him.  We're back to Lemon Party now.  I love the fact that...  Let me say this one thing.  The one guy just doing the sucking, he's propped up on his elbow. 
[02:43:30]  And you know that he can probably deep throat that cock.  But he's probably just got the head in his mouth and he's giving the head good suck action.  I looked at it.  I did everything you wanted.  Are you happy?  I did everything.  And Jim, you narrated it like I could never narrate it on the video show.  I said, move on.  That'd be great.  All right.  You signed it home on a Sunday night at 7 o'clock 12 years ago.  Look at that guy deep throat and that cock.  Let me tell you something.  If this guy falls on that rake...  I love that he can't hold the cock because of his arthritis.  Uh-oh. 
[02:44:00]  Look out for that cock.  Watch it.  That's the weed eater.  He's taking the whole dick.  It's Groundhog Day.  Boy, Grandma wants a piece of the action too.  But no women in this picture.  Nope.  So pick up your controllers now and vote.  Which guy's the game?  Which guy?  And the winner is, came out of nowhere, fingering Grandpa's asshole.  Or Jacuzzi Dog. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, man.  I bet if you could zoom in, I bet if you had audio of that, I'll bet you his lips...  Like, he's probably holding...  I bet you...  Here he goes.  I'm just speculating.  He's probably even bobbing up and down on the cock.  He's probably just holding it, and his mouth is moving like a fucking...  Like a little hamster mouth when he's fucking drinking water.  Drinking the water out of those little waters.  So it's not as sexual as it's just trying to eat a meal.  Oh, God damn, Danny.  See?  Look at that little pud in the background. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Bob Sagan has to keep twisting the screen away.  The guy's all...  Honestly, I was training Jim Norton's sandwich.  What was I even thinking?  I don't know what's going on anymore.  Everything is wrong.  What were you saying about Bob being on The View?  You were on The View?  I was on The View yesterday.  Yeah, I want to say from the gay porn to The View.  And Susan Boyle was on, and there was a bit of a...  Oh, you were on with her?  Yeah.  There was a bit of an issue, and she went on.  Oh, can we play this?  Yeah.  I was on earlier, and I had a wonderful time promoting Strange Days, my show on Tuesdays  on A&E.  Yes.  And then Susan Boyle came on and sang, and very talented, but she stopped the thing like 
[02:45:30]  it was a rehearsal, like didn't know it was live television.  Did you speak to her?  And they went back, and I did speak to her backstage, and I did the reach around on her.  She's a good guy.  And then they redid a redo.  They did a rethink for the West Coast feed, so they had her save it.  Can we play the clip?  She was also...  Yeah, you should.  She was also really good on Little England.  I'm totally getting wood.  Little Britain, I'm sorry.  What?  Little Britain. 
[02:46:00]  What?  We had gay porn on.  What happened?  No, I'm looking at my house cameras, and I'm getting a delivery.  Oh.  It's finally coming in, because I got a lot.  The truck just pulled up.  How many split of your home?  I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine cameras.  Checking out all the perimeter.  You get like on the roof with your gun sometimes?  No, I have balconies.  Like the White House?  Balconies, fine.  Like Scarface.  We saw how that worked out.  Oops.  Can't wait till you fucking fall into your pool with the world is mine fucking statue. 
[02:46:30]  Some guy with awful sunglasses fucking shoots your spine out.  How great would that be?  You really did creep up on him, didn't he?  Yeah.  Here's the Susan Boyle.  I didn't see that coming at the end of that movie.  No, he certainly didn't.  Who wears sunglasses for a murder and a members-only jacket?  He was dressed like the Iranian president.  The Colombians.  Here's the Susan Boyle clip from The View that Bob Saget just explained.  The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices, the yonder brains. 
[02:47:00]  On you and glorious Lord.  Oh, Lord, your knees.  Oh, Lord, your knees.  Oh, hear the angel voices.  Oh, what kind of effects? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  they clap  they are trying to help her along  they go boom  you only had a frog in your throat  oh my god 
[02:48:00]  that's... that's amazing  there is something of an angel that comes out when you open your mouth  this amazingly pure sound.  She fucked it up.  What are they talking about?  Yeah.  You know what I was doing?  I was backstage going,  I was backstage going,  that was a good plug for my show, right?  Yeah, it is.  And then someone said,  oh, they had a problem.  What problem?  I was literally just narcissist central.  And then like,  she shot a hairball out of her throat.  Yeah, that really was like a hairball. 
[02:48:30]  She actually coughed up a wig.  You have a frog in your throat  and John Cleese on your shoulders.  You ugly bitch.  She's not unattractive.  She's fucking horrible.  She's horrendous.  I've been looking at pictures  of guys blowing themselves.  I'd rather fuck two of these Beatles books.  Fucking monster.  Beat it, ugly.  We got it.  You dreamed a dream.  You're still a fatso.  I'm sick of everybody's love affair  with that fucking wildebeest.  Hey, wow,  we can't believe the fat cunt can do anything. 
[02:49:00]  That's all it is.  Nobody can believe  that fat, ugly bitch  has anything coming out of her.  We didn't think you had  any redeeming social value whatsoever.  Thurgood Marshall,  we've declared you worthless.  It is odd that her last name  is Boyle, isn't it?  Exactly.  Where's Lance?  Lance, her hair.  We pulled that hair  out of the middle of it.  Susan infected clit.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus.  Did you shoot something  on this sandwich?  No.  Oh, God.  Why are you eating 
[02:49:30]  an orange sandwich?  What if I just, like,  you, like, hazed me?  I just ate your goo.  I would never do that to you.  No, no.  I don't fuck with food.  No, no, no.  All right, go, cool.  No, no, no.  It's too late now.  You ate most of it.  The cock print in there  was there before it came.  Someone else did that.  More importantly,  where's Magic Bob?  Bob Kelly?  He's here.  Oh, well, thank God.  How does this happen?  Oh, he doesn't just come  in the studio  like an average guest.  Well, you represent him,  so tell me what's going on.  I will go out and get him,  and he'll make his entrance  if you're ready.  You know, do we have  entrance music?  No, no, no, no, Anthony.  That would be appropriate. 
[02:50:00]  He's all set.  All right, okay.  Do we have to turn  the lights down or anything?  He's got it.  Wow.  Magic Bob is set.  Just enjoy the show.  Bob Kelly knows  how to manage Magic Bob.  Just enjoy the show.  Does he need entrance music?  Because E-Rock's confused now.  He's such a...  Dumb.  He just asked me,  does he need...  You know what?  It's not him.  It's Travis.  I talked to Travis  about Magic Bob  and his management call.  It's not your hypothesis.  What did Travis do?  Hang on.  You just...  I'm going to go get Magic Bob.  Are you guys ready?  Yeah.  Bob, are you ready?  Are you kidding? 
[02:50:30]  I'm really happy.  Of course we're ready.  Oh, my God.  This is so...  It would be great  if Bob Kelly had a stroke  and Magic Bob  couldn't make it in.  Half his body shut down.  I heard that.  Oh, sorry.  Go to the studio,  you dickhead.  Well, you should go...  Wow.  Go get Magic Bob.  Exactly.  Bob was that inner-out character.  What was that?  I don't know.  He goes through doors.  It's amazing.  Yes, he does.  Refrigerator doors.  Here's things saying,  pick me up and eat me.  This is an oddly long amount of time.  Yes, I thought he was just  going to go out  and walk back in,  but he's left the whole premises. 
[02:51:00]  Is he putting on velour  of some kind?  Maybe.  Oh, you know something?  A cape?  Maybe there's some kind of...  Is this Carnac?  Did Bob forget  that this is radio?  Did Magic Bob forget?  We could say  he's wearing a cape  and a top hat.  I will say,  and the wand.  Bob Kelly  should just leave the building  and leave us hanging.  Oh, would that be fantastic?  That would be funny.  But don't you feel sad  when people go from comedy  to magic?  To magic. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It is tragic.  It's like going from music  to...  Breaking News.  Breaking News.  I'm being informed  that Magic Bob's assistant  refuses to be the assistant.  Why is that?  Did it entail  going down on Magic Bob?  Why won't he be the assistant?  He doesn't want to  take his shirt off?  Do you want me to go out  and find out what's happening?  I know what's happening.  I guess I can do it.  Sam doesn't want  to take his shirt off?  Sam doesn't want  to take his shirt off.  Take his shirt off!  What's wrong with you?  Oh, he needs to have  his shirt off  to be the assistant?  Yeah, he wants 
[02:52:00]  to have a sexy assistant.  Yeah, he wants to try  to hang out.  I'm hearing we need  Sam to take  his shirt off  immediately.  Yeah, Sam,  take your shirt off!  Immediately is what  I'm being told.  Is that a live feed?  Sam, what are you doing?  No, I mean,  I was just trying  to hide out,  but if this is what  it takes,  this is what it takes.  I have to do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess it does.  All right, so...  All right, I guess  you're going to  take your shirt off.  Bob Saget,  I apologize.  Yeah, this is great.  This is more...  This is more  homoerotic activity  than your  Frat House episode  that's going to be  on today.  This is a black orb 
[02:52:30]  of dead air.  I mean,  something like a reverse  geyser getting pulled  into the earth.  You notice when you  just start watching TV  and not realizing that,  oh, yeah,  we're on the radio.  Who's the tranny  on fucking Fox?  Jesus.  What happened to...  No, that's that lady  from that show,  that fashion top...  She's one of the...  Is she?  Top thing.  Fucking Adam's apple?  What the fuck's...  No, that's a woman.  You don't think she's...  You'd visit looking  at cock all day  on the web.  No, she looks like a guy.  Oh, she's the top chef lady.  You think she looks  like a tranny? 
[02:53:00]  Yes!  She's all right.  I'm going to blow me  the fucking Asian tranny.  There's no difference.  Even when the cocks  are out of this small...  Man breath on your...  That is a good point.  You never want  fucking Asian man breath  on your dick and balls.  Have you ever been  in a woman's group  where they sit and talk  about their issues and stuff?  No.  You'd be funny  in a scene like that.  I would love to be a part of that.  And they'd be with a bunch of ladies  sharing their feelings and stuff.  Yeah.  And you'd just do  your whole dick and balls thing.  Sharing their feelings.  One confessing a rape  and I'd stand up  in sweatpants  with a tent  in front of...  Talk about,  I can't get a big enough  clit in my face. 
[02:53:30]  I'm being informed again  that we have to make  the big announcement.  Okay.  So who wants to do it?  Is Magic Bob this big...  Is this big of a diva?  A dud?  I guess.  I'll make the announcement.  What's the announcement, Noah?  Well, you just gotta do the big  here's Magic Bob announcement.  Like any magician  would be intro'd  on any stage.  The lights are down.  It's perfect.  Ladies and gentlemen,  prepare yourselves  to be wowed  by the prestidigitation. 
[02:54:00]  By the prestidigitation.  By the magic  of Magic Bob.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Magic Bob music  and everything.  The curtains.  The curtains have been drawn.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Last assistant.  Magic Bob.  Ladies and gentlemen,  introducing  Magic Bob.  Oh, wow.  Who is that  in the UFC  sweater hoodie?  Hoodie that's pulled up  over his unibomber.  Unifanjure. 
[02:54:30]  Yes, he's a unibomber.  It's a unininjure.  It's Phil Locke.  Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome.  Yeah.  Welcome to the show.  Wow, he's very,  very flamboyant  with his arms.  My first trick?  Yes.  Very descriptive.  Are you ready  for my first illusion?  Yes.  Something tells me  to take your first trick.  Just like strike them.  Regular deck of cards.  Please take those cards.  He's just got a movie around  like a...  See them?  He is.  He's just like  a Madonna video.  That's good.  All right. 
[02:55:00]  Let him in the back.  Okay.  That's enough.  All right.  We get it.  He's inhaling  and sniffing your fingers.  Jimmy's inspected  some of the cards.  They are real cards.  Magic Bob is fanning  through the cards.  I'm going to take my two cards.  Can you hold that card?  Bob Saget,  now the assistant.  Don't look at it.  Don't know where this...  Don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Don't look at it.  Bob is now still  fanning through the cards.  Don't look at it.  He gave him another card.  Don't look at it.  Please put them together.  He's giving them two cards.  Let me see the cards.  Bob is putting them together. 
[02:55:30]  Kelly.  Can you see these cards?  Now, Jim,  you inspected the deck.  It was a regular deck of cards.  Yes, I did.  I'm going to show you the cards  with two red cards.  We got that.  I can't see them.  We're going to take them  right here.  No, you're moving them  really fast.  And you turned the lights  out too dark.  I went to a bar mitzvah  once.  The kid did his trick slower.  Here we go.  These cards.  Two red cards.  We're going to put them  in the deck to nine.  They were red.  I barely saw it.  Here we go.  Now we put them  in the middle of the deck.  The lights are off in here.  Here we go.  It's pitch black.  Are those the cards? 
[02:56:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I wasn't able to see anything.  It's pitch black in here.  Trust me.  Those are the cards.  Magic to a blind audience.  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't think those  are the cards.  I'm too distracted  by that.  I remember it being  a wider shot.  That tuft of hair  underneath Sam's belly button.  I don't like it at all.  Are you aware?  It takes away  from the twinkishness.  Magic Bob,  are you aware  that you're doing  a trick right now?  We're not talking to you.  Magic Bob just gave you  the hand swoop.  He's doing some kind of  real David Copperfield  hand motion.  It's beautiful.  It's schmuck Henning. 
[02:56:30]  Shuffle these cards up.  Oh, this is awesome.  That's amazing.  Magic Bob dropped a couple.  It's Harry who gives a shit.  Harry who dummy.  The way your hood  covers your chin,  it's like you have  a set of balls.  Yes.  What do I do?  Just touch them.  Touch the deck of cards.  Take the fucking cards.  Oh, take the cards.  Magic Bob is impatient.  God, he changed.  Now what?  Now what?  Now just look at the cards  and make sure they're  regular cards. 
[02:57:00]  Just inspect the deck.  Did it?  All right.  They seem like regular.  What's that one?  Seems weird.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  That was a good one right there.  He's creeping me out  how much he's staring me  in my eyes.  Magic Bob is very intense.  They call him  Penny, Pasta, and Teller.  Someone taught him  to stare down his subject.  Alfred Boring.  All right.  Here we go.  Are you ready?  All right.  Everybody.  I'm the only one  staring into this guy's face. 
[02:57:30]  Here we go.  I'm going to take this card.  You see this card?  I'm going to take this card.  I'm going to put it right on top.  I'm going to take the card.  I'm going to take it.  I'm going to actually slip it  into the middle of the deck.  Push it in.  David Plane.  Remember the card, correct?  I'm going to snap the deck.  Mundane.  David Mundane.  And that's the card.  Oh.  I don't know.  Wow.  Listen, the music kicks in.  I stopped watching you  when you came in.  I was like,  oh, he's flipping the cards  around like a maniac.  He's theatrically  throwing cards around. 
[02:58:00]  I think I saw a red light.  He's got a follow spot.  The card just nailed Jimmy  right on top of the head.  That's all right.  It's where it was meant to go.  Okay.  Wow.  It's Ricky J-Date.  Magic Bob.  Okay, here we go.  Ready?  Magic Bob,  could you make those books disappear?  Please.  Do some press.  They're too heavy.  Okay, here we go.  Ready?  Yes, yes.  This chick right here.  Now, I want you to find.  He's looking at me.  I've become you.  Yes, yes.  And you.  Oh, right.  Okay, I want you to tell me to stop.  Right? 
[02:58:30]  Stop.  When you feel it, Bob.  When I feel it.  When you feel it.  Oh, right.  The ten of diamonds.  Tell me when you feel  when you make the ten of diamonds.  I call him Moudini.  Stop.  Right here.  That's it.  I'm terrible.  Is that it?  Take that.  We're going to take this right here.  Okay.  That's the ten of diamonds right there.  Pesto change-up.  I just saw what he did.  Who was it?  No, I just saw what he did.  What did he do, Bob?  He switched the card out.  No, I saw it.  I saw you palmed the card.  No, I've been around magician hacks my whole life. 
[02:59:00]  No, I saw it.  You fucking switched the card out.  You did it right over there by then.  I'll put the card right here.  I mean, no, you stopped staring at me  and you went off game.  It's David Lane.  It's a card on the floor.  It's complete pandemonium.  Thank you.  He's standing on my foot  to keep me from looking.  Ten of diamonds.  Ten of diamonds.  Okay, that's it.  Jordan writes,  Criss Angel food cake.  Criss Angel food cake.  Ten of diamonds.  Ten of diamonds.  Ten of diamonds. 
[02:59:30]  Ten of diamonds.  Yeah.  This card right here.  Ten of diamonds.  Guys, he's doing it now.  Ten of diamonds.  Did he do Harry who has a sandwich?  Guys, he's working his heart out here.  What did you say?  Fucking Harry who has a sandwich.  Fucking Andrew from D.C.  He's touching me.  David, stop a meal.  It's David Copperfield's magician. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, shit.  Five of diamonds.  Okay, I guess.  Right here?  Cigars and scotch.  For his next trick,  he's going to make a buffet disappear.  Where is it?  What?  What's going on?  That's five of diamonds.  He's still going at it.  He's so bad I turned off my camera.  He couldn't find it.  Five of diamonds.  Five of diamonds.  Where is it?  It's even bothering.  Right here.  I guess.  This is the five of diamonds right here.  Okay, Dad, we're going to put the five of diamonds there.  Let me tell you something.  Schindler's list was more fun than this. 
[03:00:30]  I'm going to pick the jack of spades.  All right.  I think it's right here.  Yeah.  Okay.  So the cards you picked out of the deck.  Yeah.  Pen and tell him to order me another plate of jacks.  Five of diamonds.  Yeah.  Ten of diamonds.  That's what I picked.  You picked them out of there.  But I didn't look at them.  What are these cards?  That's exactly the cards he said was going to be there.  Oh, wow.  What happened?  I think he did a trick.  Why?  Because the music's playing?  They want him to make a bullet disappear into his head.  Can I even do what you guys would do? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Where's Magic Bob going to be playing?  Oh.  I'm going to be at the Gotham Comedy Club Thursday.  Magic Bob.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Just Magic Bob?  Hang on a second.  It's hot.  Good news, by the way, for Magic Bob.  Yeah.  Tickets for Jim Norton's Borgata show go on sale Friday morning for January 15th.  Magic Bob will be making an appearance.  I will.  I'll actually be opening there.  Do you guys see this?  This is my final trick.  Harry Panini.  Harry Panini. 
[03:01:30]  That's a great one.  Here we go.  You ready?  Yes.  It's a quarter.  It's a quarter.  Respect that.  That's a quarter.  Pass that around.  Go.  Let me see if that's a real quarter.  Oh, my assistant will pass that around.  Is that a real quarter?  That's a real quarter.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's a real quarter.  I'll take everybody's word for it.  That's a real quarter.  That's a quarter.  All right.  Show it to Anthony.  Oh, God.  I don't like his nappy nipple hair.  No, I don't like it either.  Just stay away from me.  Next time in Brooklyn, next trick, he's going to saw a six-foot hero. 
[03:02:00]  What am I doing?  Is that a real quarter?  Magic box.  Just touch the quarter.  It's not a gay quarter.  Well, why even have Sam fucking with no shirt on?  That's my assistance.  I'm done.  Okay.  I'm going to take this quarter.  I'm going to take this quarter.  Okay?  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  Are you a not-off book now?  Are you ready?  That's cool.  The magicians always put their hands in their pockets while they're talking.  That's good distraction.  Are you ready? 
[03:02:30]  And then you stare at people for five seconds.  He's got his hands in his pockets, fishing around.  Aren't you supposed to divert people's attention before you just put your hands in your pockets?  I have the quarter.  It's right here.  Is your hoodie flammable?  I hope it's all over.  Oh, what's he doing?  Oh, it's a smokeless cigarette.  Wow, he's burning a hole through with a smokeless cigarette.  That's amazing.  Oh, wait a minute.  Well, the assistant's not really doing any flamboyant things.  You're supposed to, like, present it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, my God.  The cigarette went through the quarter.  It's really cool.  The cigarette went through the quarter.  I don't know how it's done.  Look at him.  And now he's blowing it.  His assistant.  Oh.  And now it's out of the quarter.  And it's back to just being a regular quarter.  It actually went into his other hand.  I'm amazed.  How did it end up there?  Oh, the cigarette.  I get it.  Oh, oh.  Did you used to go to aerobics classes back in the day?  Look at that.  Your movements.  Your movements.  His hand just went back in his pocket. 
[03:03:30]  Look at the way he moves.  He just puts things back in his pocket.  Oh, wow.  Just as quickly as he came in.  That's it.  He's leaving the curtains.  A round of applause, please, for Magic Bob.  Wow.  All right, Sam, put your shirt back on.  I have to go get it.  Wow, that was amazing.  What's up, guys?  How was everything?  Oh, oh.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  Where have you been, Mr. Magic Bob?  I was just doing some sit-ups.  Yeah.  Could you have picked a more believable excuse?  I'm sorry.  I was like anything.  I was running for office. 
[03:04:00]  I was reading.  I was having a horror.  Can I ask you a question, Bob?  Do these cards look familiar to you?  I don't play with cards, dude.  I've never seen these cards.  I don't do cards.  Oh, God.  That was good.  That was amazing.  I like that.  That was intermissive.  That was just amazing.  Honestly, I've never.  You might want to check your show a lot of times.  That was unbelievably painful.  The quarter might have landed in your drink.  I don't want to eat.  It did land in my drink.  It did. 
[03:04:30]  You threw the quarter and it landed.  You're trying to kill me.  That was the end of his trick.  He throws the quarter in the air and it lands in somebody's drink.  He does that every time.  I ate Jim Norton's sandwich while I watched Magic Bob.  It was like dinner theater in hell.  Magic Bob said that the shirt he had over his head smelled like baby farts.  He told you that?  Magic Bob told you that.  On the way out, he ran by me.  He actually ran right through the window.  Who opened the curtains?  I don't know. 
[03:05:00]  That was amazing.  I saw the curtains open.  Oh, my God.  Thanks for, you know, Tom Bob.  People wondering if he disappeared in a cloud of smoked ham.  Uretha writes, I wish he was Magic Johnson.  I wish he was, um...  I wish, um...  Does he say Prego instead of Presto?  I wish he could make all those cards go to his stomach or something. 
[03:05:30]  Fucking Chip stinks.  Fucking Chip was over Thanksgiving.  I liked the coin trick with the cigarette.  I always used to like that when the 10-year-old special kid would come over and do it.  They learned that.  A Johnson Smith catalog.  We'd order it.  What, did he do a magic trick with a coin or something?  Yeah, yeah.  He actually put a cigarette in the mouth.  No, it was amazing.  It was cool.  I wish he could have seen it.  Oh, wow.  We liked it.  We enjoyed what happened in here. 
[03:06:00]  It was pretty good, yeah.  I was digging it.  Why are you holding cards?  Bob Kelly, what?  I just found these.  You found these cards?  Yeah, they're laying around.  These are cards.  Just laying around.  I'll just, you know.  Oh, you're playing with cards?  Oh, he's burying that top card, which was an eight of diamonds, I believe.  So the two main things...  Eight of diamonds!  Two of spades!  Oh, wow.  Eight of diamonds.  It was on top, but I just saw him take the eight of diamonds and bury it.  What's that?  I don't know how that happened.  That's amazing.  What do you like better, Bob?  Cards or gay porn? 
[03:06:30]  Think quick.  There's actually a site called Gay Porn Magic, which is called Sleight of Hand.  You reach into a man and pull out his card?  Sleight of Cock, Sleight of Hand.  It was the nine of cock.  It's where you put a penis in and it comes out as a pink sock and makes his intestines appear.  You go ta-da as he lays there with his fucking entrails hanging out of his asshole.  Like an elephant stuffed on his stomach. 
[03:07:00]  You can sew two buttons on that for the kids.  That little sock puppet.  It's funny.  I wish he was Magic Johnson was a good one.  That was funny.  We got to apologize to Kevin Smith.  He was on hold during that.  He had Kevin on hold?  Yeah, we couldn't get to him.  Someone, please apologize.  I feel better about the time I've been left on the hold.  That's the shit that goes on.  Yes, I'm sorry.  Kevin Smith's so smart and funny.  I know.  Why would you do that?  There goes our relationship with Kevin. 
[03:07:30]  And he puts me in movies.  Get him back on the fucking phone.  Oh, that's terrible.  Why would you have Kevin Smith on hold?  Well, Magic Bob was a 90-minute exercise.  Fuck Magic Fat Bob.  Exactly.  I wouldn't take those 48 minutes back for anything.  No, no.  It was only 48 minutes.  Probably, it was only eight minutes.  I could have done a special, gone to Switzerland and come back on the length of what that was.  It was fantastic.  It really was good.  It was fun to buy it.  It was good four millimeters. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, very good.  I didn't get to see one trick.  I was too busy reading what people were saying and making up names for you.  Were they positive?  Yeah, very positive.  We're so negative.  Our audience is really mean and nasty.  Oh, that's funny, though.  I like your audience.  Wow.  I like to bugger them.  So what are you guys going to do now?  I don't know.  We were very close to tying things up, but I wanted to talk about the WikiLeaks guy for a second. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  I love him.  Now, he comes out with all these secret memos and documents about world leaders and stuff the diplomats are doing around the world.  And now he's being brought up on rape charges out of nowhere.  No, but there was allegations for a couple of years that he had there. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What a convenient time to actually put him on the Interpol.  I don't want to sound like, I know this is what they're doing.  It's a conspiracy.  The government is involved.  If you can't trust the government, I'm a Navy SEAL.  Are you?  Oh, shit.  Do you know?  Do you know what happened?  But this sounds like one of those conspiracies.  Sure does.  He's up on rape charges.  Jesus Christ.  That's a brilliant one.  Do you hate that guy, though, when he's doing those shows?  I exposed the Kennedy assassination. 
[03:09:30]  Just many years later.  Did you see?  He went to Area 51.  Yeah, Area 51.  Because if I step over that line, they can shoot me.  Will they really shoot?  Will they shoot a governor?  You're not a governor anymore.  No, they wouldn't.  They wouldn't shoot you.  And then they kept teasing it.  When we come back, the governor confronts gunmen at Area 51.  They have binoculars.  And then he goes, they'd shoot me?  Yeah, yeah, they'd shoot you.  All right, let's turn around. 
[03:10:00]  It's not worth it.  And that was the whole show.  See, they're going, the guy just jerked us off the whole goddamn show.  And then the other one, Plum Island, was one of my favorites.  Because he's like, we're being tailed by the Coast Guard.  And it's a dinghy that he needs a fucking lens three feet long to even see.  A little Zodiac boat.  They're tailing me.  I think we better turn around.  He never does what he wants to do.  The governor confronts a line of machine guns. 
[03:10:30]  No, I don't.  I'm going home.  All right, governor.  As he shakes.  I love the shake.  One of my favorite shows now to watch.  So, yeah, it is uncomfortable if they're talking.  This guy, it's been going on for a while, but the timing is obvious.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know what, man?  I don't know.  As long as troops aren't put in danger, that's the only issue I have, or if he's not endangering civilians.  But as far as the communications, fuck these people, man.  I've had enough.  Look at this shit.  They're not doing anything.  It's taken out of context. 
[03:11:00]  I'm sure it is.  But, like, they don't give a fuck about taking things out of context.  Fuck them.  But he should be doing it, by the way, with other countries, too.  I don't want it to just be the naughty United States.  How about you fucking get some stuff from Pakistan?  Get all of the stuff.  You know what I mean?  Don't just read that stuff.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't even know what that means.  I don't want to do this.  Symbols.  I don't want to do this a second time.  We got Kevin Smith on the line.  Oh, thank God.  Kevin, we have to apologize.  We were in the middle of this really crazy bit from Magic Bob.  That was totally cool.  I was listening to it, and then we had a get-the-kid-to-school emergency that I had to hang up. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  So it all worked out.  The timing was a little bad.  And then I felt bad, and then I saw on Twitter, somebody was like, quick, call them back.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No worries.  But the bit was funny.  I was digging it.  It was funny, really?  Not where we sat.  Why did I go to Magic Bob?  Why did I go silent, Bob?  Magic Bob.  I was listening to the Smodcast, and it was you talking about the Spider-Man musical. 
[03:12:00]  Did you guys go?  No, I have not gone to that.  I was laughing my fucking ass off at the Smodcast.  Thank you.  You hit it right on the head.  It was amazing.  My favorite part of that conversation was my notion of the Spider-Man musical of a dude just  running back and forth across the stage while they turned the lights on and off.  Yes!  Just...  The swinging effect.  Turning the lights on and off.  It really did sound like you guys were smoking while you were doing this show. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, certainly not Mosier, but yeah, I can't say that I was a little...  At one point, I think I heard one of those raspy, nice, I just took a great hit cough.  And then you went into the thing about Swiss Miss, the villain, and I was fucking laughing  my balls off.  Thank you.  Very funny, man.  Very funny.  Coming from a pro, that means a lot.  Thank you.  What it...  Why?  Who else said it?  What's your take on the Spider-Man thing? 
[03:13:00]  Let our great audience in on it.  I mean, it was just...  I didn't see...  In terms of on the podcast, I talked about not seeing the point and going so incredibly  expensive, 65 million bucks, like it's theater.  And theater, people are used to, like, kind of dopeness.  And I know Julie Taymor likes to do things very big, but I just do it the opposite.  I would just...  Every time he had to swing, I would just have him run back and forth across the stage,  turn the lights on and off real fast, and play like... 
[03:13:30]  You know how much money you'd save?  Logistically, it's easy.  You're not breaking equipment.  It's so easy.  It's not going to be as expensive.  There's one guy to pay to turn the lights on and off.  Did you read all the stuff about the...  I guess they had a preview night.  Everybody wrote a piece where they're just like, it's a disaster.  Yeah, they said it was...  They had a lot of mechanical problems, and at one point, Spider-Man was just kind of  left hanging there.  Oh, really?  On his own thread.  Oh, really? 
[03:14:00]  A web.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I want to see it.  Based on everything I've heard, I want to see it, but it feels like I have to see it  very quickly.  Yeah, I think you want to see it quickly.  And you were mentioning on the Smodcast that you want to see it, because it seems like  something that's going to be so incredibly bad that it's good.  Yeah.  I mean, over the top.  Yeah.  And another great point was, what's the core?  Like, who are they looking for?  Because I don't think you're going to get a lot of people that are into the original comic  book wanting to see this. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the people who are the core of the Spider-Man fans, the people that read  the books or whatever, I mean, they're going just...  If they're going at all, they're going to be like, look, they've done it again.  Another abortion of Spider-Man.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Just to sadly mark the, yet again, Spider-Man getting taken and bent over something pretty  hard.  Are they doing another movie, too?  Like, another...  They're revamping.  They're rebooting.  Rebooting.  What the fuck, man?  The series of Spider-Man that you were in, Jimmy, that's old school. 
[03:15:00]  Already?  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  Now they're revamping, completely rebooting, recasting.  Hollywood sucks.  And redoing the whole universe.  Kevin, how can they...  It's Saget.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  How are you?  I thought of you the other day, because I was...  I mean, I don't want to...  This is kind of an age thing, but go with me as a compliment.  I'm here.  I was reading an article about Bosom Buddies is having its...  I guess it's 30th anniversary.  Yeah.  I was the warm-up comic, and I was on it once.  Yes, you were on that episode.  I was the audience warm-up of Bosom Buddies.  But you were on an episode.  I was on an episode. 
[03:15:30]  But you were on an episode, like where Thelma Adams wouldn't come out and sing.  You had to keep coming out.  I was Bob the comic.  Tom Hanks called me Bob the comic, and Chris Thompson was a producer, and he put me on  the show.  Wow.  That was the first place I remember seeing you, and I remember being like, that dude's  funny.  Thank you, man.  I sang New York, New York, and they cut to my feet doing a lame-ass move.  All I was going to ask, how did Marvel Comics not sue over this Spider-Man?  Because they probably licensed it out.  They signed off on it.  They signed off, probably, yeah.  Yeah, they must be involved. 
[03:16:00]  Why are they doing a new fucking...  The same story?  They just stink out there.  Are they going to go darker with it, Kevin?  Do you know?  I don't think it's darker.  I think they're probably going to go a little closer to the Ultimate Universe books that  they do, Spider-Man a little younger and whatnot.  But I think the idea is this, essentially, the deal that, you know, Marvel owns those  characters, and of course, they own the rights to make movies, unless they licensed them to  another studio years ago, before Marvel was a filmmaking force itself, before Iron Man  and Hulk and whatnot. 
[03:16:30]  They would just license off their characters.  They licensed them off to Sony, and Sony made a very successful series of Spider-Man movies.  Now, Sony's license runs out at a certain point, unless they choose to renew it.  The deal favors them by making more movies.  So they were like, look, we obviously went astray with the last series of movies.  Nobody seemed very happy with the third one.  Sam Raimi was kind of noncommittal about wanting to do another installment when they  wanted to do it, and they agreed to go their separate ways. 
[03:17:00]  And the studio said, let's just start all over again.  They're like, why not?  That was 10 years ago.  Let's just start all over again.  They're doing it to keep the character, and to keep it out of the clutches of Marvel Studios,  which is now owned by Disney.  Oh, wow.  Naturally, if you're Sony, you're like, I don't want to give that up to Disney.  Fuck that mouse.  But how about they just fucking get some creative writing, and they just write a better story  for the fourth?  Maybe that's what they're doing for this version.  That's the thing.  It's like, maybe the revamp is better than the last one.  I don't know. 
[03:17:30]  I mean, it may not have Jimmy Norton in it, but...  Well, a lot of people say that I was the linchpin, but kind of...  You were.  I bought it.  I was like, that's New York right there.  Brought the whole story together.  If webbing could shoot out of a penis, Jimmy Norton...  Believe me, you didn't pull yourself around by your own strung semen.  I improv that.  I improv something about masturbation, and they're like, look, this is a kid's movie.  Exactly.  Your target audience.  That's good for the Blu-ray, though.  They didn't...  It was second unit.  I didn't even meet Sam Raimi.  Why don't we tell everybody what Kevin Smith is going to be doing out on Long Island? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, the Westbury Music Fair.  It's called something else now.  I'm actually coming...  I'm coming east tomorrow because I've got a House of Blues gig in Boston.  Oh!  Yeah.  And then on...  That's December 2nd at the House of Blues in Boston.  And then December 5th is the...  They keep calling it the theater at Westbury, but I call it the Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah.  I'll always know it's that.  You play there?  How is it, man?  It's really nice.  Are you doing...  Is it a stage move?  Opie came out and saw it and it was fun.  I saw it.  Are you going to be in the round? 
[03:18:30]  You're in the round and I think the stage moves the entire time unless they change that  up.  They can turn it on and make it revolve like a little microwave, if you want.  I'm looking forward to telling stories and getting a workout at the same time.  It moves so slowly you'll never know unless you start looking and realize people are  changing in front of your eyes.  Bob, you know I'm the guy that got thrown off the airplane, right?  I would notice any speed.  I've been going to a lot of places and you've been just kicking ass in these places.  For people that might not know, what show, what do you do for your show that you go to? 
[03:19:00]  For this one, sometimes I go out and do the podcast live, but this one is just me doing  the kind of Q&A thing.  Yeah, that's great, man.  I don't have that many.  Well, actually I do.  Now I have a whole bunch of red state to talk about.  But before I was kind of like, I got to cop out in my life in terms of making that movie.  And then much hadn't happened, so all my stories kind of end there.  But the last year I actually got a bunch of new stuff to talk about. 
[03:19:30]  So the Q&A's could be kind of interesting.  They're always at least kind of fun.  I've seen one of these.  I went to Carnegie Hall.  It's amazing.  Standing ovation by the end of it.  I need to see it.  I've got to come out and see if I'm hearing amazing things.  You really should check it out, Bob.  I will.  I will.  Yeah.  It's backdoor comedy, Bob.  Well, that's where I start.  But is anybody from the show coming out to the Westbury Fair?  What night of the week is it?  It is Sunday night, sir.  Yeah, I think I might be going to that one.  Yeah, you live in Long Island.  Yeah, I'm right there. 
[03:20:00]  I've got family all asking for tickets.  I think your people are helping me out.  They're all taking care of me.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I'm going to try to make it out.  No pressure.  I mean, I heard the silence.  I was like, fuck, I offended her.  No.  We were all looking at each other like, who's going?  I'm in studio.  I'm flabbergasted that they blew you off for the incredible act of Magic Bob.  Magic Bob was amazing.  I can't tell you.  I was literally, I was watching paint in an old house of mine dry.  I was thinking about going, too. 
[03:20:30]  I had to make sure my girlfriend might be PMSing now.  So I have to see what her fucking vag looks like by Sunday.  Jimmy's lady is really good looking, man.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, she's sexy.  I don't want to say hot and offended.  That's not, please, not offensive at all.  Yeah.  Oh, she's a really attractive chick.  My father elbowed me and goes, God, her mouth looks fuckable.  I'm like, Dad.  Jesus.  Yeah, she's sexy, man.  But she's, I might come Sunday, but I have to get up so early Monday. 
[03:21:00]  And that's the problem.  We do the morning radio.  Yeah, that's why I believe me.  No worries.  No worries.  I'm close enough.  Hey, Kevin, what are you doing with the hockey season being so bad for you and myself?  Both our teams suck.  I mean, I've never, as a fan, I've never had a season like this in my life.  So it was kind of, I mean, this is almost like the first season, like 1982 doubles.  Yeah, I'm frustrated because I got season tickets.  And I'm looking at the stack of tickets, realizing it's a waste of time at this point.  At least you got a couple of cups, though. 
[03:21:30]  Your boys are at the bottom, too.  Bottom?  We're the worst team in hockey, and you guys aren't much better.  Yeah, yeah.  Or maybe one above or two.  But in recent memory, at least the Devils have some, you know, glory there.  How far back do you have to go for the Islanders?  Yeah, but I agree with you, but the Islanders are even worse than that.  Yeah.  I mean, they are so fucking bad.  But to be fair, they beat the Devils last week.  The Devils, yeah, we shut them out.  And that was the day I threw my tickets out the window and filmed it, and people think  it's a fake video, whatever.  Fake, totally fake.  I decided.  You tell it's fake. 
[03:22:00]  Photoshop.  Yeah, I'm so frustrated with the team.  They lost 14 in a row.  I made a video of me actually taking my season tickets and throwing them out the window.  Oh, good Lord, man.  Yeah, it's been tough on you and I.  And even I had a West Coast team that I enjoy, which is the Oilers, and they've been in the bottom  as well.  Yeah, the Oilers aren't going well.  I think I curse anybody that I enjoy.  I'm kind of taking a peek at the Flyers because they got, you know, in-laws and family down.  You're just searching for a team that is doing kind of good.  I got in-laws in Philly.  Let me root for them.  I need a two-hour drive.  I could never do Rangers.  I would almost do Devils, Flyers take a peek, and honestly, a little peek at the Bruins, 
[03:22:30]  too.  The Bruins?  Good Lord, dude.  A little peek.  I didn't say they're my second team.  I'll row you out of fucking New York.  You're a carpetbagger at that point.  I'm just going with the Bruins.  I'm just going with cities I lived in there, Kevin.  Has someone been talking to you?  The fuck is wrong with the Bruins?  Who's influencing you?  My mother would say that.  It's going to be for an Islander man to suddenly go Bruins.  That would be unprecedented.  I think it's worse to go Flyers.  I don't know.  It's right up there with who gives a shit.  It's a bunch of guys hitting a fucking black thing on a patch of ice. 
[03:23:00]  Good point.  Good point.  No, there's a good point.  It's just a dumb sport.  Wait, you mean you grew up in this city, and you want the guys to hit the black thing on  the ice, and that?  No, what?  He sure puts it in perspective, doesn't he?  Exactly.  I was like, I just want both teams to be healthy.  Healthy, happy.  Right.  You don't follow hockey, Bob?  They like their families.  I haven't in a long time.  I was there in Philly when the Flyers won.  I was there with Bobby Clark and Brady Perrant.  That's how old I followed back.  You were down there?  Yeah, I was living on Cotman Avenue. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know you were a Philly guy, sort of.  How many years down there?  Temple University graduate.  Oh, okay.  That means nothing to...  So two.  Is that a community college?  I lived at home and took a train to a deli.  Hey, how are the old Canucks doing?  Jesus.  I don't know, man.  That's so far west, I don't care.  I know.  I just want to sound like I know hockey.  You talk about sports long enough, everybody just doesn't give a shit.  Yeah, why don't we stop? 
[03:24:00]  You're right.  You're right.  It really is just a bunch of fuck.  I love the Jeter controversy.  Should he take $45 million for three years?  I hate everybody.  But the headline today is they're at least talking.  Oh, thank God.  They're at least meeting.  This kid's a fuck.  Who cares?  Jimmy's so down on sports in general.  I'm sick of these fucking assholes.  Yeah.  I don't know how people do sports radio.  Oh.  For four hours of just sports.  Kevin, you know, he bats 250 with runners in scoring position.  Does he?  Who fucking gives a shit?  You bore. 
[03:24:30]  Kevin, when you go on sports radio to plug something, do you talk sports?  Because I go on there and only talk about myself or a project for seven minutes.  I don't talk.  I only tangentially talk about sports in as much as I open with, like, you know, something  where I'm like, well, of course I never got to play because I'm fat.  And speaking of fat, ladies and gentlemen.  Well, you know, they're going to play the nickel defense.  If they play the nickel, I don't know what to tell you.  How about you tell us you're fucking quitting sports radio, you fucking dullard?  It's like watching someone speak a foreign language.  It's fucking horrible. 
[03:25:00]  It's fucking terrible.  You smile a lot.  You're just sitting there going, nodding, and you smile.  Yeah.  It's like as if they were barking at you in Hindi.  And they play the shitty sound clip.  Well, you know, we just got to play one game at a time.  Well, you know, that's the way I say it.  They got to get out there and just win and leave it on.  Why don't you shut up?  Yeah, they got to extend everything.  Who fucking cares?  Four hours of nothing.  Really annoys me.  Like this very program.  I know that, but at least we say cunt. 
[03:25:30]  Magic Bob was here today.  Yeah, yes.  We had Magic Bob.  Kevin, what's your show?  I'm going to keep this on promo track again.  I got a show tomorrow night, Tuesday night, I mean Thursday night rather, in Boston.  And then Sunday night I'll be in Long Island at the music.  What is it called?  I'm sorry.  The music fair.  The Twitter at Westbury.  Yeah, whatever they call it, everybody on Long Island knows it is the Westbury.  And where are you in Boston?  In Boston at the House of Blues.  Oh, that's right.  That's cool.  That's a good place.  That's a good joint.  I've been in a bunch of them.  I haven't been in this one, but I saw it. 
[03:26:00]  Gospel Brunch, right?  Yeah, I followed you at the House of Blues in Houston in Dallas, and they said how much  fun it was.  Did you draw well in Houston?  Yeah, those were great shows.  They're great.  It's a great place there.  Do you do well in Houston?  Yeah.  I can't get more than six people in the room.  I hope a fire starts at fucking Dallas-Fort Worth and then just fucking blows through Houston.  But every one of my shows ends in a lynching.  There's pitchforks, and I'm raped, and they try to keep me alive like cannibals. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, big game.  You got the Sooners.  Oh, fucking college sports is even more vomiting.  Oh, they suck.  And their names for their teams stink, too.  Yeah, the fucking Idaho deers, they can't even get, like, good animals.  You know, the Michigan-Ohio State game is coming up on Saturday.  Who cares?  The Saturday-Turk hedgehogs fucking cares.  Colleges don't like each other.  Wow, these educated assholes don't like those educated assholes.  Why don't they solve it with fucking pitchforks and hammers? 
[03:27:00]  Fucking pussies.  Look, they're all wearing the team colors.  What colors are teams?  Like, we're blue and gray.  We're red and yellow.  Faggots.  Wow.  I fucking hate college sports.  He's miserable about it.  It's annoying.  My God, Jimmy.  Jim's not going to be doing a college tour anytime soon.  What do you think LeBron?  Why would LeBron leave?  I don't know, because it's a fucking cesspool for the mayor? 
[03:27:30]  I'd rather perform at the fucking lie pit that Jim Jones left.  I shouldn't have said that.  I actually love Cleveland.  A lot of fat pussies in Cleveland.  That's what I should say.  You're entering Cleveland.  City of this fat pussy.  They say the same thing when you get there.  As soon as I heard, that's funny, I knew it wasn't a compliment for my joke.  It was a set up for a brutal one.  Well, let's get the fuck out of Dodge. 
[03:28:00]  What's my picture?  I'm giving away my picture.  We had a lot of fun yesterday.  Plug my show real quick.  All right, let's do this properly.  Let's start with Kevin Smith so he can get off the phone.  Kevin?  Kevin's going to be at the Westbury Music Fair, I guess, on Sunday.  Whatever it's called now.  Please come out if you can, man.  All right.  Yes.  I highly recommend it.  I've seen a couple of Kevin Smith shows that are great.  Kevin in the round.  It's not going to be in the round.  I live my life in the round.  This should be no fun. 
[03:28:30]  And, of course, Boston tomorrow night for Kevin Smith at the House of Blues.  Thanks, guys.  Good seeing you, guys.  Thank you, man.  It's a great pleasure.  I'll see you out there.  Kevin Smith, everyone.  And then Bob Saget.  I've seen his new show, matter of fact, and I'm loving it.  It's a strange day on A&E, Tuesday night at 10 or 9 Central.  And then the mountain thing.  Mountain.  You've got a pretty mouth.  You've got a pretty mountain.  Strange Days with Bob Saget is really good on A&E.  Thank you very much.  I love it.  Congratulations on the new show. 
[03:29:00]  And Jim Norton's going to be doing a lot of college sports.  Jimmy's got a big show that goes on sale Friday.  I do.  Friday morning.  We switched the nights.  We have one.  The Sunday show is sold out.  It's a holiday weekend.  Saturday, January 15th, we are doing the Anti-Social Network show at the Borgata.  It's myself hosting, Brewer, Bill Burr, David Tell.  First one sold out in a little over a day, so this one will probably sell out very quickly, too.  It's going to be insane.  It's a good show.  And also tonight, Ozzy Osbourne at the Garden.  What else are you doing?  Yeah, right.  Go.  Bring him his books. 
[03:29:30]  They're still here.  Yeah.  If you can carry them.  Can we just leave the books in the studio?  I want to.  Forever.  It's good karma for the show.  Someone will steal them.  They've got to bring them in like everything else in the morning when they're set up.  I'll watch my photo, by the way.  I don't want that anymore.  Bob, remember when you were with me when I bought that?  Really?  I was.  I lived on 43rd Street.  Magic Bob going to be performing at that show at the Borgata?  Yeah, he's actually going to be doing it.  Robert Kelly has an iPhone app, by the way.  Yes, he does.  And he will be at Gotham this week.  Very cool.  Gotham.  Yeah.  iPhone app this week. 
[03:30:00]  We didn't even get to talk about your Canadian tour.  We'll do it next time.  Yeah.  You were on the run for like a month.  That was fucking Canada, yeah.  A month.  What date have you gone?  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I'm at Gotham.  Gotham Comedy Club in New York City.  Right.  Free parking.  Oh, wow.  In living color.  In living color.  It's a cool club, isn't it?  I like Gotham a lot.  I like Caroline's a lot, too, but Gotham is actually the last time it worked out for me. 
[03:30:30]  It was pretty good.  I like it.  Good for you.  It's a great club.  Tomorrow we have Jamie Hector's tomorrow, right?  Is that tomorrow?  Yeah, I think it is.  Is it?  I don't know.  What a fucking insecure douche I am.  Caroline's is good, too, just in case.  Just in case.  Just in case.  Fucking asshole.  Please.  In case Gotham doesn't want me back after this weekend.  Still loves me.  Florentine tomorrow, too.  Oh, is Jim in tomorrow?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  What's that?  You can go anywhere you want.  Magic Bob, I don't, you know.  I'm going to, I liked him.  Is Jamie Hector tomorrow or no?  He liked you. 
[03:31:00]  Marla from The Wire.  Finally.  Is that to jack me off?  We're going to leave you with the one-question interview that Sam does from time to time.  He's got a brand new one.  See you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get.
