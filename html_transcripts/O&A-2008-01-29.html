<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts proudly embracing their "shock jock" persona, rejecting the idea of polite radio, and launching into a profane and nonsensical discussion about waking up.  Patrice O'Neal filled in for Jim Norton.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the unexpected departure of their long-time boss, Tom Chiasano, sparking humorous speculation and anxieties about the show's future.  The hosts delivered a scathing, comedic critique of President Bush's State of the Union address, mocking his attempts at humor and expressing disbelief at the "No Child Left Behind" act.  A heated debate ensued regarding Barack Obama's presidential campaign, with Anthony expressing racially-charged anxieties that were met with strong pushback from Patrice and others, leading to accusations of racism and slander.  The discussion then shifted to the Boston "perv line" subway incident, Super Bowl predictions (favoring the Patriots), and a review of a poorly received Patriots-themed song by a BCN employee.  This segment included numerous expletives and jokes.

The show continued with a focus on listener-submitted and on-air created, poorly-received songs about the New England Patriots. The hosts dissected the awkward rhymes and use of players' names.  The Boston Herald article detailing sexual harassment on the subway was discussed, prompting a wide range of caller experiences, revealing varying perspectives on the humor and horror of such incidents.  The hosts also touched upon Tom Brady's potential injury, callers' use of the "FU line" segment, and Anthony Cumia's recent shooting range visit documented on YouTube.

A substantial segment focused on listener calls concerning female attractiveness, male attention, and public displays of sexuality.  The discussion started with criticism of women's athletic wear, and then spiraled with calls from Kat (witnessing a public sex act), Lauren (initially disagreeing with the idea that women enjoy male attention, leading to discussion of her appearance), Antoinette (arguing against the inherent sexual attractiveness of large breasts), Nikki from Cape Cod, and Jennifer from Jersey (who strongly disagreed with those who found male attention bothersome). A humorous internet video of a man admiring his physique was played.  The discussion touched on racism (prompted by a news item about a reality show), President Bush versus Barack Obama, and a call about a neighbor who repeatedly exposed himself, all further fueling the discussion on double standards regarding public displays of sexuality.  Bob Kelly promoted his stand-up shows and the hosts proposed a comedic skit based on the musclehead video.

The show then turned to General Butt Naked, transitioning into a discussion of "end-of-life guys" in movies (using Joe Pesci as an example).  A lengthy discussion about favorite movie guns followed, ranging from the Predator's machine gun to various guns in *Commando*, *Pulp Fiction*, *Desperado*, *Taxi Driver*, and *The Jackal*.  This led to misogynistic comments about women in service positions.  Hypothetical scenarios involving killing Osama bin Laden and the potential consequences were explored,  followed by discussions of the US withdrawal from Iraq, the reasons for US involvement in the Middle East (oil), the possibility of invading Venezuela, the challenges of transitioning away from an oil-based economy, and the hypothetical use of peanut butter as car fuel.  The show concluded this segment with a discussion of a Discovery Channel documentary on post-human Earth, a falling satellite, and a segment about "Water Car Guy" and speculation about his death.

The final segments began with a discussion of Stan Meyer's death (allegedly inventor of a water-powered car), leading to speculation about foul play and other mysteriously deceased inventors.  This shifted to a recurring bit about absurd culinary delicacies made from animal parts. A caller plugged a comedian's show.  A segment followed featuring fake FCC complaints, primarily focused on *The Simpsons*.  Danny, a guest, helped identify the fabricated complaints.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing an audio clip of a past prank involving a hot air blimp and "bra bombs," with Patrice providing commentary and anecdotes. The hosts reflected on their past behavior and evolving styles.

The show concluded with a reminiscence of their earlier show format, focusing on the shift away from playing music towards unscripted conversation, crediting Dave Douglas.  A contentious, expletive-laden discussion about a former colleague, Mark Parenteau, ensued, culminating in an abrupt end to the segment.  The hosts then repeatedly chanted "The European and Anthony Show" as a closing joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wow, Jesus, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Usually I'm alright.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning.  I can't help it.  Wow.

[00:02:00]  Fiancée  And because she was coming to bed  It kind of like woke me from my uh  My deep sleep  And I just started babbling  Alright I'll get up I'll get up  Time for work  Like no it's midnight you idiot  Go back to sleep  Ah that's great though  When you got time like that  I just wake up and just start babbling  I like that though  Babbling babbling babbling  I like waking up maybe  Yeah like midnight 
[00:02:30]  One  Even two isn't that bad  Yeah  For a few seconds  And you look at the clock and go  Oh  The worst is waking up like a minute before the alarm  Yeah  Cause then you're just like oh no  Oh no  I gotta get up  I woke up and now I gotta get up  Do you have bursts of weirdness when you wake up  With your girl  Ah  Because getting up at like 4, 4, 15 every day  It's like  It's like waking up from a coma  Like if you woke up from a coma  The first thing you would say would be something just weird  And like  Wouldn't make sense 
[00:03:00]  I would imagine  Yeah  Until all your senses sort of start re-adjusting  And focusing  And fine-tuning themselves  You would wake up and just go  I've been in a coma  Right  It would just be some like  Ah giraffes attacking Mars  What  Where am I  It would be something really stupid  Me and uh  Me and the girl  We just laughed  Because there are so many weird things that happen  Like  One morning the alarm goes off at 4, 15  She turns on her lights  And we're both completely asleep 
[00:03:30]  She turns on her lights  I start screaming  Why are you turning the lights on  And I'm like  Oh  Oh  It's my alarm  I gotta get up now  And she doesn't know  She doesn't remember turning the lights on  And it's just all this weird crap happens  For a few seconds  As soon as that alarm goes off  Every morning  So there you go  Good morning to everybody  On this fine  Two for Tuesday  What?

[00:07:00]  Into a country station  Right  I know  I know that's what  They got planned in the end  It's obvious to everybody  Yes sir  Yes sir  Anyway  Well we have the State of the Union  That happened last night  With President Bush  We did  I tried  I really tried  I mean it was on every radio  Radio station  On every TV station  So you gotta take a peek  Yeah  I had to give up within minutes  Within minutes  And then I was watching  And then I was watching  Some dumb show  About like  Like  The underground world 
[00:07:30]  Of Manhattan  On the History Channel  Interesting  Or was it Discovery  Sometimes you don't know  The difference between the two  Was Hitler in it  No  Then it was Discovery  History Channel  No matter what they're talking about  Hitler has to work his way in there  Yeah  It's his job  Yeah that's a great way  To look at it  No matter what they're talking about  Somehow they gotta connect  Hitler to it  Stan had one of the best lines  In the office  About this stupid  State of the Union address  Yeah  He goes he just  Turns into like  He was 10 years old again 
[00:08:00]  When that comes on  Just turns into a 10 year old  Remember when you were that age  And the State of the Union came on  And you were completely disinterested  Sure  Didn't want any part of it  Was upset that the regular shows  Weren't on  That's exactly how  A lot of people felt  Especially since this is his  Last State of the Union address  It's his lame duck  State of the Union address  Which means  Nothing gets done  He could babble up there  All he wants  Which is what he did  He's really not getting anything done 
[00:08:30]  You could tell  The completely divided  Democrats and Republicans  By who stood up  When he said things  Right  I mean at one point  He was saying that  The tax cuts that he made  That expire in I think  2010  Have to be permanent  He goes  And the way  To help the economy  Is not to have the government  Reaching into people's pockets  But we must make  These tax cuts permanent  And  The entire 
[00:09:00]  Republican side  Stood up  Harumph  Harumph  Harumph  Ladies and gentlemen  And the Democrats  Were all sitting there  Just kind of  Looking around  Arms folded  Talking to each other  Yeah what are you doing  And you look at that  And just go  This is completely  It's all BS  Divided  And they will never  See eye to eye  On things like this  Bush might as well  Have said stuff like  And I want every American  To have a million dollars 
[00:09:30]  In their bank account  And I will work  Until the end of my term  Right  To get a million dollars  For every person  In the United States  I don't know  It doesn't matter  Whatever he said  Was useless  I don't understand  Why  The president  Is allowed to be  A lame duck  In this day and age  Yeah well  Like between now  And what  Next January  Nothing's going to  Really get accomplished  Nothing is going to  Get accomplished  From his desk anyway  From both  Because  Anything that the 
[00:10:00]  Democrats come up with  He's going to veto  Right  He's done that  Plenty of times already  And anything he comes  Up with  They're not going to  Pass it  So  It's  Nothing gets done  That's why I think  Everyone's so focused  On the election  They're just waiting  To see what happens  Yeah  George Bush there  He pointed to Obama  What did he say  How you doing pal  Oh really  Yeah  He's going  Hey  How you doing pal  Hey homie 
[00:10:30]  Brother  You really pointed to him  Yeah  You know how he does  That kind of thing  He's a big pointer  George W  He's a big pointer  Winker and  He does that  You know  Right  Well  Can you imagine  In your life  Like there's a lot  Of people out there  If you were allowed  To be a lame duck  At your job  Why is the president  Allowed to be a lame duck  Where you just come in  And sit down  And you can't do anything  Well you know  Like your contract's up  Or whatever 
[00:11:00]  You just know  Like maybe you have  A temporary job  And you have this job  For a certain amount  Of time  And at the end  Of that time  Three or four months  Out let's say  Yeah  You could just turn  Into a lame duck  We were a lame duck  For two years  Remember  Well we were  We were sort of  Unemployed  You know  Well we got  We got some  Contract stuff  Coming up  Could you imagine  We could turn  Into lame ducks  Right now  Lame duck  Like the president  Well I don't even know  How far we're going  To get into this  But just a little 
[00:11:30]  Little taste  Don't panic on us  And go find a twofer  Somewhere  Most of the tax relief  We've delivered  Over the past seven years  Will be taken away  Some in Washington  Argued that letting  Tax relief expire  Is not a tax increase  Try explaining that  To 116 million  American taxpayers  Who would see their taxes  Rise by an average  Of $1,800  Others have said  They would personally  Be happy to pay  Higher taxes  I welcome their

[00:25:30]  So yeah  My claws  Came out  God  I'm getting ready  For my second career  Man  Goodness  I've never done radio  A day in my life  I need some help  I'm gonna be  I'm gonna be  PD slash consultant  Come in and pat me  On my back  When I do my show  I just go  Hey that interview  You did with the wrestler  Hey hey hey hey  Hey  What?

[00:26:00]  That's all  I just wanted  I just wanted to  Soften your delivery  A little bit  And the whole thing  Because I've seen you  I'm saying it was good  I've seen you destroy people  Oh I know I have too  It was good  But the ones I destroyed  Deserve it  Which makes me  An unfair destroyer  Yes  Yes exactly  Hey that thing  You said  About E-Rock's chin  The other day  Patrice  It was just unacceptable  Patrice  What?  I'll be completely honest 
[00:26:30]  With you man  You used to scare  The crap out of me  When you came in  And did our show  Why?  At first look  You're  Incredibly  Intimidating  That is the story  Of the business  Really?  Yeah with me  I walk in a room  And it's just like  I'm not a cheery  Big black guy  You got a tough  Outer shell  You don't allow a smile  To come upon that face  I got bad teeth  And I'm just not  A smiler  I'm not a  I'm a laugher  But I'm not  Like a smiler 
[00:27:00]  If you see any pictures of me  It's just nothing  That has to do with a smile  I'm just not good at it  But that's  How you take to me  Is the story  Of my Hollywood life  Comes in  And I try to just do the job  You're a Chris Rock  Just  Not a pleasant guy  I don't know how to be happy  Chris Rock truly trashed you  And said  You're very talented  But you're  I was going to say  But you're stupid  But that's not really what he said  He goes  You're very talented  But you're an ass  Tim came up with this  That's good 
[00:27:30]  But Super Tuesday  Is next week  Yes  Super Tuesday  Isn't today  I kind of said  It might be  I was uninformed  And I wasn't able  To get to Tim in time  Super Tuesday  Is next Tuesday  So Barack Obama  Anthony  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Something he said  Scared the crap out of you  Well 
[00:28:00]  What did he say this time  Oh my god  Well Barack was talking to  See I think he talks different  To a group of black people  Than he does a group of white people  And he was in front of a group of black people  And he was talking  And  Added on stuff  It was a little  It was just  The message was a little different  Instead of a regular  Up and down handshake  There's a little  Couple of knuckles involved  Yeah yeah yeah  It was  It was more this  You can't quite put your finger on it  But  He kind of was like 
[00:28:30]  Saying things like  Well  You'll be able to tell your children  Uh oh  That this is the time  For change  And this is the time  For  Healing our nation  I'm just thinking  Buzz  Buzzwords for killing white people  Well  You are  You are genius  How'd you  How'd you crack the code  It's a time for change  Children should come together 
[00:29:00]  Oh  Oh no  It ain't good  This is it  He said  You'll be able to tell your children  He's addressing a black audience  Uh oh  So you'll be able to tell your children  Which means  Children of these black people  That this was the time  But no  There was no TV around  That he could have possibly  Been talking to every child  Just because there was a black  No  Now when he's talking to an all white  Uh uh audience  Yeah  And he says your children  He's talking to black people 
[00:29:30]  On TV  He's not addressing  No but no  He's not addressing the white people's children  In the room  But he isn't sounding as  As black  When he's addressing white people  In a room  I don't mean voice wise  I just mean  There's subtle things  What do you think  You think I'm not perceptive to this  This is propaganda  Do you think I'm not perceptive  To this  This is evil  This is not evil  You can't stop with propaganda  There is a slight difference  Stop your white fear  Stop  We're not  We're not planning to do anything to you  I didn't 
[00:30:00]  I didn't say  Barack  Barack is not slipping  See here's what you're doing  That you hate  What happened  You're attacking  In  Influxions  Fluctuations  Of his  Of his tone  You're reading into  Underlined things  He's telling black people  This guy is a well trained politician  He's winning  He's winning  He's winning the south  He's  Well of course he's winning the south  He's winning  Midwest things 
[00:30:30]  People are not getting  That vibe from him  No no  Stop trying to get white people  It's a puzzle  That's what  I'm just saying  I notice these things  You notice him saying our children  And go  It's the message  That he was giving  No black child to be left behind  The message he was giving  Okay  Is that  Hey  Black people  This is our time  This is slander  What you're doing  No  This is what  This is slander  You can't even say this 
[00:31:00]  I love how his paranoia  Turned into perception  It's just  Slander  It's not slander  I'm just saying  What I feel  He was  Was addressing  What he was doing  You're violating  His constitutional right  I am not  You're accusing him  This is a witch hunt  No it isn't  If you would  You're  You're too biased  To open your ears  And see  I'm not biased  To open my damn ears  I'm listening  Yeah  And that  Okay  And there's a message 
[00:31:30]  I'll cut you off  Go ahead to the message  There's a message  Going to black people  That  You finished  Yeah  Wait  Wait a minute  Uh ladies and gentlemen  Of the jury  Yes sir  Your  Your presentation  Just now  Was it  No no no  You had no more  Than he said  Black children  You got more  No it was  It was that  But no I have more  I have more  How are you letting him do this  Hold on  I have a reason  Because  I have a reason why  Because he's insane  No  It's hilarious  Keep calling me insane  So insanity  So racism 
[00:32:00]  Has now been  You  White people are so genius  Why is it gotta be racism  Patrice  Why does this have to be racism  The people  Why is my opinion  Of what Barack Obama  Is doing on the campaign trail  Have to be racist  Because he's a black man  And I'm white  It's not an opinion  It's a slander  It is an opinion  Patrice  It's my opinion  Listen listen  There's a lot of people  I trust and listen to  As far as this radio show goes  Right  And my peeps  Tell me  Let him just  Rant  And talk about this  Because he sounds like  A crazy person 
[00:32:30]  I do not  I absolutely  People would agree with me  Nobody  Oh I'm not  Nuts will agree with you  No  Not true  I think there's a lot of people  That agree with  What Anthony's saying  But Anthony is  Very very bothered  At the prospect  Of having a black president  And why don't you  You know what  I'll be a lot more  Understanding  Okay  If you just say that  What  I have a problem  With a black  I have  In general  I have said that  Okay  And I've never  Why  Why 
[00:33:00]  Because  And here's the reason  There is this  Don't say not qualified  No no no  I won't even go to that length  Because that's  That's what people use  To get around  The fact that  They're not happy  About a black president  A lot of people  Myself included  Have said  White America  Is not ready  For a black president  I agree with that  Or a woman president  I agree with that  But here is something  You won't expect  But we're ready  For John McCain  Or Mitt Romney  Don't throw any other  Candidates in  They're all jackasses 
[00:33:30]  We're talking about  Negroes  They're all jackasses  But here is something  Now get ready  This is a quote  You're going to want  To jot down  Because this is the  First time I've said this  When you say  That's a quote  You're going to want  To jot down  I feel that you're  Talking directly  To white people  I am  I'm talking to  White people  Right now  White people  And their children  Go ahead  I just want to  Make sure  That I'm  This is something  I haven't said before  And I don't think  Anybody else  Has said before  I don't believe  Black people  Are ready  For a black president  Black people  Are absolutely 
[00:34:00]  Where did that laugh  Come from  That was a profound  Statement I just made  But you know something  I got a reason  I'm a context guy  Hold on  Hold on  I want to hear  His reason there  Patrice  Let me  After you say  Discuss  Discuss  Have the giant  Drum that goes  Boom boom boom boom boom  When you say  I don't think  Black people  Let me try to  Embrace a context  I think your people  Are jotting it down  Already  Okay  I believe you  You could have a point  There in terms of 
[00:34:30]  What it will do  Is almost  Force black people  To maybe make  Another angle  As opposed to  Race all the time  Right  So that  A lot  I think a lot  And I agree  I believe in this  A lot of black people  Need the hatred  That we have  For white people  To actually  Function  Sometimes  Yeah  So if  It gives you  A common  Brown  It makes us  A little different 
[00:35:00]  Yeah  Also  That we might  Not want to be  It's like  How racist  A country  Can you possibly  Live in  That would elect  A black president  But we would  Rather not  Have another  Old white man  Trust me  Trust me  We are  We are  We have  Come far enough  To go  You know  Let's give  Let's give  A young black man  A chance  As opposed to  Another  Old white man  Who's done  Nothing  Nothing  Look at where we are  Where the hell are we  Look at where we are  Where is  We're in a fear  We're in a fear  That you have 
[00:35:30]  That the  Ungabungas  Are coming  To get you  Ungabungas  Look you say  Oh the old  White man  You're tired  Of what they've  Done  This country  Is the greatest  Country on the  Face of the earth  I didn't say  These days  You go slander  Technology  Technology is amazing  Look at  Oh would you rather  It be like the Sudan  They got some great  Young black people  In charge over there  With dots  And pickup trucks  With machine guns  In the back  Are you  Are you  I'm just saying  Are you saying  That slave  Harden black people  Are the same 
[00:36:00]  As these maniacs  Running around  With socks  And AK-47s  That's what we are  If you're going  To talk about  How old white men  Have turned this  Country  Into what it is  Here's what  White people  Into a successful  Prosperous nation  The other day  Your boy  That day was  Praising him  And Norton  This guy  You wasn't here  You were sick  That day  And he's just  Going  We should go  Back to where  People were  People  When was that  The 20s  Where black people 
[00:36:30]  Are unfairly  Treating  You guys  Are having a blast  At the Cotton Club  Back then  I saw the videos  You're dancing  And playing the horn  Harlem was rocking  We just had our  Little area  And God bless y'all  Y'all  You were you  And we were we  And then you woke up  From a hangover  And went  What happened  What happened  I'm saying  Black people aren't ready  You're not reasonable  In this  No this  I'm being very reasonable  Alright go ahead  This can be  Enough crotchety 
[00:37:00]  Old white guys  Still down there  In Washington  To make sure  Everything is  Running smooth  That's what I'm saying  It's not going to be  It's not going to be  A drastic change  It's going to be  A black symbol  Of leadership  But this country  If he gets shot  The next guy  Is the president  Do you think  Do you think  A nice  Liberal  Democratic  Congress  Is not going to do  Everything  This guy  Puts forth  In office  And what  You don't think  Out of white guilt 
[00:37:30]  Out of not wanting  To look like a racist  They will pass  A lot more  Of the bills  He comes up with  And there's none  That would be  That would be  Name a bill  That would hurt you  As a white guy  That would hurt me  As a white guy  Okay  Let's take  A crap load  Of money  And put it  Towards social  Programs that  Don't work  That are completely  Race based  And what programs  Were those  Because you're saying  It's like  It's based on history  What affirmative action 
[00:38:00]  Affirmative action  Welfare  Welfare's gone  Hey welcome back then  Welfare is gone  Then let me give it  A fond  Let me give it  A fond welcome back then  With my god damn  Tax dollars  With the negro  Welfare president  Well  You know something  Are you serious  How else  Is his constituency  Of black people  Going to  Black people are barely  He's not being 
[00:38:30]  Supported across the board  Are you kidding me  Let me tell you something  The black people  Have you seen the percentages  The black people  That white people  Don't like  That don't like  That white people  The black people  That white people  Don't like  Which is Al Sharpton  Jesse Jackson  A couple of guys  On power  Right  You know  That aren't  Really supporting  Obama  They don't feel like  He's black enough  He's black enough  See  He's not  The black candidate  Yes he is  He's a candidate 
[00:39:00]  For black people  Cause look  Why shouldn't we  Have our image  It's just like  We have to look  At Jesus  That looks like  He's a lead singer  Of a band  My entire life  And he looks like  He looks like  Osama bin Laden  That's what Jesus  Really looks like  Show me a picture  He's right about that  Stop it  You see how unreasonable  Where does the Bible happen  It's in  You know  It's in where  Yes say it  Northern  Northern  Africa  Oh I see 
[00:39:30]  The desert part  Where plenty of guys  Are as white as we are  That look like  Jimmy Page  You ever see  Clea Patcher  She looked like  Liz Taylor  Are you  I'm joking  Jesus  Jesus looks like  Jim Morrison  And Robert Plant  You're right  What is wrong with you  Jesus sang for  Whitesnake  I'm with Patrice  On this  You just pay attention  A little bit  In history class  You're like  Wow  We bamboozled  The world  With the image  Of Jesus  I'm not even saying  That he looks like  You know 
[00:40:00]  One of the Wu-Tang Clan  I'm saying  He looks like  An Arab  He probably looks  Like an Arab  But we  We're comfortable  We will not  Take  And I don't  Drift off  But we will not  Take pictures  Of this long haired  Hippie dude  That we love  To look at  Here's Jesus  He's blonde  Blue eyes  He looks like  Van  He's all ready  To go to  A Grateful Dead show  Van got  Jesus face  Right now  Jesus was a  Deadhead  Why can't we  Be comfortable  For five minutes  Looking at a 
[00:40:30]  Black president  He's not going  To do anything  Special for us  You know  I'll give you  A good idea  Why white people  Aren't comfortable  Looking at a  Black president  Because they're  Racism  No  It's not  To do with  Racism  If  It has a lot  To do with  Racism  Come on  If we haven't  Why do I have to  Be comfortable  With Bush  If we haven't  Been being  Pointed at  As the oppressor  For so many  God damn years  First of all  Well after  Years after  That was even  Relevant to say 
[00:41:00]  Here's my problem  With that  Yes  What you just said  What you just said  Okay  And I'm gonna  Let you go  I mean  I'm gonna  I just wanna  Just  I just wanna  Say to you  Okay  Here's my  Biggest problem  With white people  Alright  You're not  All white  We don't  There's some weirdness  With white people  That your skin  Bonds you together  And thinking that  We all think  You're the devil  Anthony  You're an Italian  Gambling  Drinking man  That lives in  Long Island  You're not 
[00:41:30]  My  Oppressor  You're not  The evil  White man  A cow farmer  In Nebraska  Who's struggling  To just  Suck milk somewhere  He's not  Who I look at  As the white man  But the way  This country  The racism  Of this country  Makes average  White dudes  Think that  They're better  Than me  Because they're  White dudes  And they think  That I think  They're better  Than me  Because they're  White dudes  You're not  My oppressor  It's a system  That oppresses 
[00:42:00]  Even white people  That black people  Don't like  Poor white people  Are oppressed  Just like poor  Black people  But white people  Think that  They're better  Than poor  Black people  That's the problem  We don't look  At you like that  You're not an  Oppressor  We look at  Bush and the  System  As an oppressor  We can't just  Have a symbol  We're still  Going to be  Oppressed  Give us  Give us a little  Something  The presidency  Of the United 
[00:42:30]  States  Is a little  Something  He's the  Commander in  Chief  He's not  Look at  Colin Powell  Was the third  Most powerful  Man in the  World  If he's the  Third most  Powerful in  America  Also  He's barely  Black  But he's a  Black man  Republican  Ideology  Not for  Too  Too  Many  I see  Too many  Social programs  That'll cost  This country  A lot of  Money  None  Don't tell me

[00:47:00]  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  All  I  Listen  We're 
[00:47:30]  Going to  Change  Gares  Just a  Little  Bit  For  A  Little  While  I'm  Sure  We'll  Get  Back  To  This  Because  We  You  You  You  I  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  after the break. But Jay from Boston,  yes, we're going to talk about this.  He wrote in, excerpt from the Boston  Herald today. The trains are so  packed, they don't know who is going to blank  rub their butt.  Anonymous butt rubbing. 
[00:48:00]  On the red line. Yes, they're  calling the red line up there in Boston, the perv  line. The perv line. Nice. It's the front page  of the paper. The Boston Herald knows  how to sell papers.  I mean, who's picking up the paper  down here just because it says, you know,  freaking BAM a lot.  You know, I mean, perv  line, that makes you want to read. Yeah.  We all want to read about pervy things, no matter  who we are. And we'll get into that article  after the break. It's Opie and Anthony and Patrice  O'Neill. 
[00:48:30]  It's a busy, busy morning.  Everyone's getting their  flat screens  and their HDTVs for the  big game. Yeah, apparently  this is, remember  when people used to rent those things  for the Super Bowl. Now, the  prices come down so much that people just go out  and they have these big sales at the electronics  places and they buy these huge screen  TVs now. Which goes to show you  that these things are pretty cheap to make in the end.  Yeah. Yeah. And when they  were like $15,000. Oh my god. 
[00:49:00]  It's almost stupid to even, you know,  brag about a flat screen TV.  Almost everyone has one now. Yeah.  Not almost, but you know, it's getting  up there. It really is.  And the Pats are going to win the Super Bowl.  Oh boy.  Brady.  No, they should. I don't want to say  anything, but. Brady's running.  They have footage of him running, so  stop with the controversy. Here's the last  thing I just heard updated  immediately. It was  he's, he worked out  but he was limping a bit and his 
[00:49:30]  foot's wrapped. Yeah.  That's a problem. He's still got a foot thing on his foot.  That's a problem. You guys got a problem  with his foot. A foot thing on his foot. He  doesn't need to run though. He's not one of  these running quarterbacks. He just has to  drop back a few feet and throw  those freaking amazing passes that he does. That's it. You can do it without foot.  Yeah. He's not a mobile  quarterback for the most part. He can get around,  but he's not, that's not important.  There's eight. Hobble him like  in misery and he can still play.  If he had a wrist injury, I'd be  very fearful, but a foot thing on his foot. 
[00:50:00]  There's 18 other guys on the team that you need to worry  about having a bad foot on that. Right.  If you said Lawrence Moroney, Randy Moss,  if you said Wes Welker  had a high ankle sprain.  We like to call it a foot thing on his foot. If he had one  of those foot thing, then you got  a problem.  But Brady is a  three-step, five-step drop  back quarterback who tosses it to  people or hands it off.  His move is, Patrice has just  nailed it. That's his whole move every game. 
[00:50:30]  He's three, five steps back  and then he looks for his receivers for the  most part.  That's what he does.  That's all he does.  That's all he does.  If it was Michael Vick,  we'd be worried.  You should be more worried  that your dumb giants,  now they're at least dumb giants,  they got the flu.  That's why they're going to lose  the Super Bowl.  They had to spray the plane and everything.  Yeah, they got five or eight guys  that have the flu.  And that flu thing doesn't go away  in a day or two.  That thing is with you for a while.  If it's the one that's been going around. 
[00:51:00]  If it's the one that's been going around.  It's going to be a blowout.  They're going to lose the Super Bowl.  I talk about that  in my personal life.  How you work your whole life  towards some goal.  In this case, let's say the Super Bowl.  And it's time for the Super Bowl.  You dreamed about it  since you were five, six years old  putting on the football helmet  for the first time.  The day finally is upon you  and what happens?  You got the flu.  Yeah.  And you can't enjoy it.  Eli Manning should just 
[00:51:30]  not have any facial hair.  What is that?  It looks like pubes.  It's awful.  Just cut those off.  It's awful.  Giants are going to get slaughtered by it.  Yeah?  Is that your prediction?  I think so, too.  It's not even a prediction.  It's like you go 18-0  and then you're going to lose  to the spurting Giants.  That would be...  They're having a spurt.  You're going to lose.  Degrading.  You're going to lose to the bum.  Eli Manning is not going to happen.  Okay, good.  It's just not going to happen.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Take all your money.  The Giants is a destiny-stopping team. 
[00:52:00]  You think they'll cover the spread?  Was it 12?  It comes back to betting.  12-something?  No, I think it comes back to betting.  It comes back to betting.  Okay.  Who cares about the human story?  No.  I don't think they're going to do the spread.  14 might be,  but the Patriots have been playing...  Put it this way.  They haven't been playing poorly.  They just haven't been beating people  by 85 points.  So, I mean, 14 is reasonable.  The Giants will either win,  but it's not going to be one of these games 
[00:52:30]  where the Pats win and not cover the spread,  if that makes sense.  14?  I think you might be right.  I don't think this is a field goal Super Bowl.  It's either the Giants are going to win  or it's going to be a blowout.  I don't think it's going to be a close game,  I guess is what I'm trying to say,  as far as the Pats winning by a close score.  I really don't.  Hey, BCN is playing a Patriots song,  and I'm going to be honest,  I don't know if it's good or bad.  I have no idea.  It's got to be bad.  We like playing the Super Bowl song. 
[00:53:00]  Any team song is usually horrible.  I would say that.  Well, it's one of the guys that works at BCN.  Super Bowl shuffle.  So, as soon as I saw that,  I'm like, oh boy, what if it's bad?  We can't trash the guy because he works for BCN?  Uh-oh.  So, I really don't know.  If he's putting together a song,  he's probably a guy that's open to criticism  and praise if it's good.  Well, he's got a band and stuff.  Yeah, it's called When I Say Patriots  by the whack-ass Egyptians.  Patrice has already got a little opinion. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, and Patrice is a Boston guy, right?  Yeah.  Although, as soon as you could,  you got out of there.  You have to, but...  I mean, in my business, yeah.  What am I going to do?  All right.  Here's a taste of When I Say Patriots.  When I say Patriots,  you can say touchdown, Patriots.  Touchdown!  Patriots, touchdown!  When I say defense,  you can say shutdown, defense.  Shutdown!  Defense, touchdown!  When I say Patriots,  you can say touchdown,  Patriots, touchdown!  Patriots, touchdown!  When I say defense,  you better say shutdown, defense. 
[00:54:00]  Shutdown!  Defense, touchdown!  It's been eight months  since the Patriots was stopped.  Now we're ready for a season.  With a team that's been restocked.  Added new players.  Fighting for the win.  Thomas getting more sacks.  Deliver at his chin.  If Bill we trust.  With sixes in his own.  Six states won't be having till we're 16 and 0.  With three new caps and two battling the chalk.  From Lawrence to Zayo all the way to Kevin Fall.  Yeah.  Touchdown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a monster. 
[00:54:30]  When I say Patriots, you say touchdown.  Patriots.  Touchdown.  Patriots.  Touchdown.  When I say defense, you can say shutdown.  Defense.  Shutdown.  Defense.  Shutdown.  When I say Patriots, you can say.  Cutdown.  I'm going to be nauseous.  Cutdown.  You don't like it?  It's making me physically.  As a white guy, I think it's.  Run out of here.  As a white guy, I think it's all right.  I have to say as a white guy.  Good for you, man.  I mean, it sounds like a McDonald's commercial.  It's like.  Yo, Mickey D's.  Yeah, it's like a safe rap song. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  It's safe.  It's not hurting anybody.  It's like Beastie Boys stuff.  You know what really disturbs me about any sports team song is when they name the names  of the players and work that into the song.  For some reason.  With three new captains who battled the chalk from Warren to Seau all the way to Kevin Fogg.  Yeah.  That just.  Yeah.  That annoys me.  That I say defense, you better say shutdown defense.  Shutdown.  Defense.  Shutdown.  Step into Gillette.  Get cut off like a razor.  Brady.  You're working with precision like a laser. 
[00:55:30]  Sorry, Tony Tanda.  But there's a new boss.  Rifle with Sobrana.  Throw a bomb at Randy Moss.  After two downs.  Realize that they own you.  So February 3rd.  When they win in Arizona.  Defense don't think it makes offense sick.  Mike, Michael Vick.  Teaching old dogs new tricks.  Ah, ha, ha.  It's Michael Vick's dogs.  I guess.  I say Patriots, Super State.  Touchdown, Patriots.  Touchdown, Patriots.  Touchdown. 
[00:56:00]  When I say defense, you better say shutdown defense.  Shutdown, defense.  Shutdown.  When I say Patriots, Super State.  Touchdown, Patriots.  Touchdown, Patriots.  Touchdown.  When I say defense, you better say shutdown defense.  Shutdown.  Defense.  Shutdown.  Cut.  What do you think?  Look. 
[00:56:30]  Tommy G from Columbus.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Quiet.  Tommy G from Columbus writes, when I say douche, you say.  Oh, my God.  But we can't say the other part of douche.  This sucks.  This sucks.  Because the children are listening to our radio show.  Not even Patriots fans could enjoy that.  Like, even if you're a big fan of the team.  No, you're not just going to be, yeah, tailgating and blasting that.  And then someone writes, defense, touchdown. 
[00:57:00]  Why would you say that?  Oh, it's a new healer from Kentucky.  I think it was saying defense, shut down.  Oh, shut down.  And it was Patriots, touchdown.  I thought it sounded all right.  And then defense, shut down.  So, you're not listening to the words, man.  Defense.  That's just as bad as the big D and the fence that people hold up.  D and then a fence.  A picket fence.  Isn't that hack at this point?  Oh, it's so hack. 
[00:57:30]  It was hack the first guy that held it up.  And the thing that bothered me about this song is there's so much passion in it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's sweating.  He means it.  Yeah, let me.  You know something?  I'm going to do another take on the defense, shut down.  All right, roll it back.  I'll do another take on that.  I'm going to defend it.  I don't think it's that bad.  He rhymed chalk and fuck.  I don't think it's that bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the rhymings are pretty.  Bill Belichick.  And wait, if you're going to play us, your ass is not going to be able to cash our Bill Belichick. 
[00:58:00]  I'm surprised that isn't in there.  Let's go to Dennis in Jersey.  Dennis?  Oof.  Hey, man, I'm sorry, dude.  I'm not one of these guys who's going to nitpick the show, but if you know anything about sports, man,  anything in your lower body and you go to plant, it's going to hurt and Brady's hurting.  And in the Super Bowl, the flu is the least of your problems, like you said.  You're going to get the flu Super Bowl Sunday.  Fine.  So what you're saying is his anchor, he'll go back on it and it'll give way. 
[00:58:30]  He'll quit the game.  Exactly.  Imagine Dennis is completely right and Brady can't plant, so his throws are like 20 yards  over the guy's head.  Everything's going to be going off to the left.  You just take a knife and cut his hamstring.  He'll quit the game.  I love it when he says that.  You know, Dennis, obviously it's a concern. 
[00:59:00]  I'm with you, but I think you just shoot some of that illegal drug crap into the ankle and  all is good.  Cortisone or something.  They just inject cortisone.  I'm joking about the illegal part.  Let's relax.  But I think you numb it up a little bit and you plant it a few times and win a Super Bowl  and then you rest.  Right?  When I say turn it, you say off.  Coke logic.  I don't know.  It's not as bad as the jamming song that's being played in Boston. 
[00:59:30]  There are some bad ones.  Do you want to hear another one real fast just to taste, Patrice?  You thought that one was bad?  I didn't mind that one.  I don't really know.  You know, I think I don't mind.  It's catchy.  I love L.A.  Yeah.  New York, New York.  I enjoy.  I love L.A.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but those aren't like team songs.  You know what annoys me about the team song?  Yeah.  What?  It's a team.  They adopted it as a team song.  They talk about like the area and streets and stuff. 
[01:00:00]  I love L.A.  Yeah.  I mean, it's always something with a Laker fan, but.  Yeah.  Look, man, your Yankees have one of the worst songs ever with that.  How, how, how you doing?  It's awful.  How, how, how you doing?  Don't even.  It's awful.  And we can't even find a copy of that anymore.  That dumb song that they used to throw down our show.  You know why I hate when they put the name of the players in there?  Play Let's Go, Metz Go.  And you'll, you'll see why, because it's so dated.  What's wrong with Let's Go? 
[01:00:30]  Like, what's wrong with Let's Go, Metz Go?  You hear all the players from like 1986.  You're like, oh yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Here it is.  This is Let's Go, Metz Go?  No, it's not.  I just turned it off.  No, we're not here.  What happened?  I want to hear Let's Go, Metz Go.  How, how, how you doing?  Let's go, Metz Go.  Oh, God damn.  Remember this?  And you can picture like two people turning around in sync.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  And going, let's go, of course.  Standing at Shea.  Fine, how you doing?  No, play a little more of that.  I want to hear a player.  Let's go, Metz.  We're going to make it this time.  We're going to take it home.  Let's go, Metz.  Let's go, Metz Go.  Let's go, Metz.  Let's go, Metz.  Make it happen.  Let's go, Metz.  Where there's a midnight night.  All right, let's go.  That song is way worse than when I say Patriots. 
[01:01:30]  That is so bad.  Are you serious?  That is way worse.  It's right up there.  Listen, listen.  But I want to play this before we go to break.  So then Jammin' in Boston, they got their own Patriots song.  Now this, you want to hear bad.  Oh, boy.  Laser lights.  Good stuff.  Yep.  Yeah.  Better ring.  She doing.  She doing.  We got an undefeated team. 
[01:02:00]  The best one ever.  Whatever.  Them pats making history up in her.  Whatever.  And here.  Well, her.  Her.  It's not here.  Up in her.  When Obama becomes president, officially, it's going to become her.  Break yourself.  I'm the president.  I am the president up in her.  Up in her.  Up in her.  Up in her.  As they're painting the White House black, he's going to be saying.  Break yourself.  Break yourself, Whitey.  Break yourself. 
[01:02:30]  Her.  18-0.  18-0.  One more to go.  Super Bowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait for the rap.  Wait for the rap.  Wait for the rap.  Stand a chance.  Chargers.  New York's going to get a smack.  18-0.  18-0.  One more to go.  Super Bowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Man, I've never seen man like this before.  How a team going to go.  18-0.  Since we got Randy, he stole the show.  Coming down with anything. 
[01:03:00]  Time Brady throw.  Professional.  Incredible.  Defense.  Making hits if you're a vegetable.  First down.  Come on.  Touchdown.  Come on.  Beatdowns.  Get it right.  Let's go.  Now go to the Dinos.  They best to be quiet.  We still humble.  Pot-ass the charges.  They tried it.  You cannot deny it.  Our team is on fire.  We've been through the wire.  Y'all best to retire.  Man, I thought I told ya.  New England pass taking over.  Get a real QB, not a poser.  Eli realized that it's over.  It's over.  We got an undefeated team.  The best one ever.  Whatever.  Them pass making history up in her. 
[01:03:30]  And punch.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't stand in the chair.  We don't stand in the chair.  Charging to New York, gonna get a smash.  18 and up.  18 and up.  One more to go.  Superbowl.  And punt.  Yeah.  Of course, and punt.  There are no police Negroes in that song at all.  They're called police Negroes? 
[01:04:00]  Superbowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Those boys are whiter than Obama.  Oh, good.  Well, there you go.  So you got a couple more Superbowl songs out there that some people are enjoying.  What can I tell you?  No one's enjoying them.  Somebody.  No.  Somebody.  No one enjoys team songs.  Where are they?  A couple mamas.  Oh, yeah, there's probably a couple of moms that's like, yeah.  Yeah, man.  Your Superbowl song is being played on the radio.  Doing that awful skinny leg, bow-legged fat belly dance. 
[01:04:30]  Don't swear.  Revere.  We got to go.  And Revere.  Some giant mullet.  Oh.  No.  They weren't saying Ben-Hur in that song.  Ben-Hur.  Blue Heeler Kentucky is becoming a star on Instant Feedback.  No, that wasn't in the song.  Hey, when are we going to do the perv line thing?  How about next?  Very good.  How about next?  Please. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, the eyewitness accounts are just terrific.  This seems to be the line to take if you're up in Boston.  The red line.  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, there's one they didn't highlight because it's not as funny as the other ones.  Mm-hmm.  Because this one looks like it's the beginning of a rape.  But the rest of them are, I don't know, maybe we're just sick.  Maybe we're just sick.  What is it?  A little, uh...  It's horrific, but it's also really funny.  Of course.  And we've talked...  Ah, we'll get into it next. 
[01:05:30]  Because some of the women out there do agree with us.  Like, when they see a flasher, like, on a subway, they don't run away screaming and hollering.  They think it's hilarious.  They think it looks ridiculous.  Yeah, they snap pictures.  As long as that guy's not, like, you know, now attacking them.  Mm-hmm.  They take themselves out of it a little bit and go, this guy looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  Flashing me with that thing.  Of course.  All right, we'll get into it.  Hey, uh, the FU line.  We love the FU line.  It allows you to vent.  Yes.  Who do you...  Who are you mad at? 
[01:06:00]  Sure.  Who do you want to send an FU to?  Let's see what the FU line is all about today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, I'd like to send my FU out to the guys who answer the phone at the O&A show who don't  know how to put people on hold.  They accidentally hang up on you three times in a row.  Hey, nice job.  F*** you.  Next message.  My name's Tommy, and I'd like to say a big f*** you to my union hall. 
[01:06:30]  They better find me a goddamn job.  Next message.  My name is Barry, and this f*** you goes out to Brad, you little f*** midget, mind your  own business.  F*** you.  And by the way, your wife's cheating on you.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big FU out to a so-called friend named Carly.  Next time you want to talk trash about somebody behind their back to their best friend, why  don't you grow some f*** to say it to their face, you dumb bitch. 
[01:07:00]  FU, Carly.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big f*** you to myself for not having to f*** to quit your job and  get something else you really like to do.  F*** you, or I guess it'll be f*** me.  And, uh, leave some weight and dress a little better.  You deserve it, Tim.  Next message.  I want to give a big f*** you to Heath Ledger, you self-centered, attention-seeking f***ing  whore going ahead and f***ing dying on everybody and putting a big shadow over top of Tom Chiasano's 
[01:07:30]  retirement.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  How's everybody?  Doing alright today?  Goodie.  Good.  Opie and Anthony.  I hate to do this, but I gotta get this last bite in.  Patrice, where are you gonna be? 
[01:08:00]  Patrice O'Neal, uh, sitting in for Jim Norton, who's I think filming like a movie today or  something.  I think today was his day where he was, um, filming that Kevin Smith movie.  Yeah, our pal Kevin Smith.  That he begged to be in.  He pretty much coerced Kevin Smith into putting him in, in his movie.  He wouldn't stop until Kevin said, alright, I'll give you a part.  Oh, where are you gonna be?  Patrice O'Neal is gonna be at the Tampa Improv Thursday. 
[01:08:30]  Patrice O'Neal is gonna be at the Tampa Improv Thursday, January 31st, 8pm.  Friday, February 1st.  Saturday, February 2nd.  TampaImprov.com.  The number is 813-864-4000.  And that is Patrice O'Neal, me, at the Tampa Improv this weekend, Thursday, Friday, and  Saturday.  Are you guys in Tampa?  Mmm.  No.  How you doin'?  How you doin'? 
[01:09:00]  Ah.  How you doin'?  That's pretty bad, Ant.  Let's go Mets go.  It's pretty bad, too.  I know.  You're right.  I don't think there's one sports team song.  Team songs.  Name one that was good.  It's easy to play all the bad ones.  Name one that might have been good.  Super Bowl shuffle for back in the day for the living.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you look back now, it's like...  But then you loved it, though.  But back then, you think, all right, this isn't too bad, right?  And rap was new.  Yeah.  Like, so it was kind of cool.  That's when Whitey was really scared of rap.  Yeah, back in the old days.  Now we accept it.  Yeah, there was a time Whitey was very scared of it.  And then we had a seat in a McDonald's commercial, and then we're like, okay.  I don't think so.  I don't think white people were scared of Run DMC rap when it came out.  I think it was...  They got scared of it.  No, no, no.  Think back.  We were.  Yeah, we were definitely...  Even though now you look back and it's all innocent and fun and nothing. 
[01:10:00]  But we were kind of like, huh?  What?  What is this?  What is this?  I'm scared.  Especially because it was really on the streets back then.  I mean, even the videos were in the middle of, like, a burnt-out section of, what?  The Bronx.  You have the same...  They didn't even have a set.  The same feeling you had about old rap, same feeling you have about Obama now.  It's just something you just can't...  Well, someday I look back and think, oh, my God, that was kind of fun and harmless.  Remember when we were scared of black leaders 25 years ago? 
[01:10:30]  Crazy.  Crazy.  All right, hold on.  Matt from Rhode Island, he writes, hey, in the You Say Touchdown song, did he say something  about more sacks than on Liberace's chin?  Yes.  I didn't hear that line.  That's a good line.  That's a good line.  What does that mean?  Maybe eight years ago it was a good line.  What?  What does that mean?  Well, Liberace liked to suck a lot of dicks.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, did you catch that? 
[01:11:00]  Down the hall.  Make sure you...  Whoa.  God bless you.  Go ahead.  Patrice asked, Anthony.  God bless you.  I didn't even think it was that.  I thought it was like he had an old face, but what?  Please, electronic equipment have worked.  Please have worked.  It's hard to kind of beat around the bush.  You just got to answer the man's question, so I answered the man's question, Anthony.  Yeah, right.  That's all right.  Those are the easy ones. 
[01:11:30]  You can hit it.  Those are lazy.  Impossible.  The thing stopped to sizzle.  Yeah.  The fuse is sizzling.  The fuse is sizzling.  Now, what's really interesting about that, like, that was an obvious dump, right?  Anthony gets so freaked out, but we got a guy back there.  That was like a lazy fly ball.  That's easy stuff.  He's like a surgeon back there.  He's dissecting the show left and right.  What if he had, like, an aneurysm right before that and collapsed and died on the floor?  If he was running his temple, that's...  I wouldn't care about him. 
[01:12:00]  I'd care that it went out.  Oh, then we'd be...  I was going to say...  But at least you would know.  Here's what he just did.  Mm-hmm.  In my opinion.  Is...  Brilliant.  Less...  Yes.  Thank you.  But less dangerous than in your window.  Yeah, that's true.  Because now...  That's what I'm getting at.  That's an FCC violation.  That's true.  Which becomes a different thing than context and...  Right.  ...hurting someone's feelings.  Yeah.  All right.  No gray zone there.  There you go.  Finally, we've been teasing this a bit.  A lot of people in Boston are going to be reading about the Perv line. 
[01:12:30]  It's the red line up there.  It's part of the T.  It's part of the subway system for the rest of America.  A lot of us have been on the red line.  And the front page of the Boston Herald today says,  The Perv line.  The Perv line.  Subway sex predators have riders on red.  Predators.  Because it is the red line.  Yeah.  On red alert.  I think we need to read every single word of this story.  Usually we try to just get to the...  Skim.  Skim around.  But subway stalking perverts are more likely to attack women riding the red line than any 
[01:13:00]  other route.  Now, why is that?  Did they think about it?  Where's the red line?  Red line is...  Is that...  Is a trolley?  Is that...  That goes through Brookline and...  Where does that go?  Do you remember?  I'm trying to remember.  Doesn't that go across like the Charles and goes into Harvard and all that crap?  Right there.  Yes.  Yes.  It's Cambridge-y. 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  It's Cambridge-y.  Yeah.  It's a very upscale route.  The orange line is the...  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  The orange line is the dangerous route, I would think back.  If I can remember.  I haven't been there in a long time.  But the orange line is kind of...  Is a little dangerous.  But the red line is...  There's the green line, which is completely white.  Because that is the trolley.  And it runs through Brooklyn...  Brookline, rather.  The red line is...  Well, it goes to like...  Cambridge.  Oh, there it is. 
[01:14:00]  It goes all the way down...  Yeah, but it goes all the way down to Braintree.  You know.  Yeah.  It's all over the place.  It goes across the Charles River from...  From...  Yeah.  Quincy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some...  There's some...  Owl Wife Station.  Very non-dangerous.  Ah, there's some red alert areas on the red line.  Red alert.  Yeah, there certainly is.  There certainly is.  Downtown CrossFit.  Yeah.  Government Center.  Yeah.  Kendall Square.  Nothing.  Nothing.  A dangerous... 
[01:14:30]  That's MIT.  That's Cambridge, and there's nothing dangerous about that line.  Except for the perverts.  Except for the perverts.  All right.  It's a perv line.  That's why the perverts picked that line.  They didn't pick the orange line.  I guess they've been taking a close look for the last couple of years.  Pervs are mostly white guys anyway.  Like, guys that would do this on trains.  It's a white guy crime.  That's racist, Anthony.  But it's true.  It's true.  It's true.  Yeah, yeah.  You know that?  Be honest once in your life about race.  Of course.  I'm the most honest guy about race. 
[01:15:00]  Why aren't there a lot of black perverts?  We're aggressive.  It goes from just doing that.  Black people, we're harassers.  And there's no...  Again, there's no gray area.  White guys live in gray area.  They like going on the train and doing this thing.  Like this guy.  Instead of, let me see your panties, baby.  So there's been a...  You know, instead of reading all this, the boring stat craft, there's been a lot of incidents 
[01:15:30]  incidents on the red lines.  What is this music?  That's from Risky Business.  That's a good call by the E-Roc.  Is it really?  Yes.  Sex on a Train, I think this was called or something.  I missed that.  I missed that.  This is the great tangerine dream.  Is it?  If I'm not mistaken.  All right.  Oh, damn.  That's a white lesson I learned.  Okay.  Cool.  That's good.  This is as white as music gets right here.  Yeah, I missed this one.  You know, I'm not against white learning.  White learning.  This is new to me.  Well, the police reports reviewed by the Herald detail a range of lurid attacks by sexual predators 
[01:16:00]  from exposing themselves.  See, and you got to be careful because you get fired for this crap.  So I want to acknowledge that.  But I want the women to call.  When a guy exposes themselves to a woman and they're non-threatening, we've done this  bit before.  A lot of women call up and go, yes, you're absolutely right.  You want to laugh in their faces.  You're not scared like, oh, my God, what's going to happen to me?  Some women are.  They're petrified.  Of course.  If the guy gets more aggressive than just doing certain things. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Because the stupid media will take our little break and then cut out the parts where we  acknowledge, you know.  They think sexual harassment is funny.  Right.  Then they take out all the serious stuff of our conversation.  Then just throw the sound bites that get us fired on there.  So, OK, you got the sexual predators from exposing themselves in front of female passengers  to that word that we're not allowed to say or sometimes we're allowed to say.  You know, when you take care of yourself. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  That's going on on the train.  To grinding up against them and grabbing and groping their, well, the parts you would  want to grope on a woman.  Mm-hmm.  You know, their elbows and shoulder blades and the back of their knees.  Yeah.  I think it's more, you know, the naughty parts.  Yeah.  We want to put a stop to this is what they're saying.  Really?  Do they?  I love that crap.  Of course you want to put a stop.  We want to put a stop to this.  You don't really need that in writing. 
[01:17:30]  Working women are targets going to and fro work, said Lisa Edwards, blah, blah, blah.  The trains are so packed they don't know who is going to go through their pocketbook or  rub their butt.  And Paul, acting chief of the MBTA, acknowledged that sexual assaults are underreported because  many victims don't realize it's happening to them until it's too late while others are  too embarrassed to report it.  Oh, my.  Among the more grotesque incidents on the red line.  Here we go. 
[01:18:00]  Here we go.  The first one.  Now, we got it as a show, and this is where we need the females to call.  Is this horrific?  Is this funny?  Is this horrific and funny?  Okay.  That might qualify as that.  All right.  Is that fair enough?  Fair enough.  And can I please, and we're trying to stay as undangerous as possible in this.  Yeah.  I was reading it, and there's a time of the day.  There's a time, and there's a specific woman that they are saying, working women are being 
[01:18:30]  targeted.  Yeah.  Targeted.  So these guys have an ethic.  Yeah.  This is not just random, like he's just at 3 p.m.  This is early in the morning, getting up to do what he has to do, kind of do.  Well, these are smart guys.  It's because they're trying to make sure they don't get caught, because they're going  for crowded trains, is what you're getting at.  Right.  It's just they rush hour dudes.  All right.  So after boarding a crowded train, so is this horrific? 
[01:19:00]  Is this funny, or is this horrific and funny?  I think horrific and funny.  I find humor in it, because it's so bizarre and out there.  All right.  We've got to be really careful.  We've got to acknowledge this, because we're supposed to be responsible on the radio.  Are we?  For some reason.  I think if my mother came home and said, some guy grinding up against me on the train.  Well, then it would be horrific.  There would be nothing funny about it.  You want to kill the guy.  Wait a minute.  But that's the other point here.  We don't know these people.  We have no connection with them.  See, that's another thing.  But if my mother said that, and after I heard the story, are you okay, moms? 
[01:19:30]  You know what I mean?  Some guy just grinding me on the red line.  I might, after I found out she was okay, I might have a good chuckle.  You might laugh about it.  Some people grinding my mom's.  You know what I mean?  I might just...  Yeah, a lot of people...  I might giggle.  Kind of funny.  Look, because I want to clear the lines, because people call up with the dumbest stuff,  and we want the women to call now.  Go ahead, Bubba.  Hopefully this will clear the lines.  Go ahead.  Bubba in Boston.  Yeah, what's up?  All right, basically, the reason why the pervs get away with a lot of that stuff on the red 
[01:20:00]  line is because the red line is the oldest one, and they have all those open train stations,  not like the ones where you go down underneath where the blue line, and the green line,  and the blue, whatever it is.  Basically, they're all open, so they get away with whatever.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave?  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  Yeah, I don't know.  Because wouldn't you want to do stuff underground, then above ground?  Yeah, but it's an underground station.  They're underground.  Well, it goes above ground, too, across the Charles River, and yeah, it goes...  Ah, yes, Dave. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, the three guys used to live in Boston, you guys really forget a lot.  The red line doesn't just go through Cambridge and MIT and Harvard and all that.  It also goes through Dorchester and Chelsea.  Quincy, though.  Quincy, we said all the way from Braintree to freaking Harvard.  I get it.  Or actually a little past Harvard.  But Quincy's like...  It definitely goes through some bad neighborhoods, though.  All right.  All right.  Let's acknowledge that there's some bad neighborhoods. 
[01:21:00]  Can we hang up on all these people?  Because we want to try to get some women on the phone.  Our phones are lit with people.  We all know there are bad areas.  All right.  We get it.  Thank you.  Thanks for helping us out.  So here's the first incident.  After boarding a crowded train at Park Street at 515 one evening, it's rush hour, right?  A young woman felt a man cupping and rubbing her bottom.  Bottom?  That's how they write in the paper.  Her bottom.  Cupping and rubbing her bottom. 
[01:21:30]  When she asked him to stop, he explained he was reaching for the pole.  She certainly was.  Whatever you want to call it there.  Well, she was hoping that...  I mean, he was hoping that she was going to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make your own joke at home there.  While walking home after this happened on the train, she discovered...  Can you say this?  Not even.  Why not?  I think we're allowed to, though.  She discovered something.  I know some stations will panic and dump out, so let's keep it as clean as possible. 
[01:22:00]  While walking home, she discovered that he had blank on the back of her pants.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Let's say I put a hole blanked on the back of her pants.  He had blanked on the back of her pants.  Do you do, Paulin?  Do you do, Paulin?  It's almost like Charles Nelson Reilly. 
[01:22:30]  They're kind of the same, but very flamboyant.  But he was on Match Game.  Can you say cool, Whip?  Let's see.  He had Cool Whipped on the back of her pants.  Hmm.  Wow.  We're going to have to go to the judges for that one.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  He had...  Look at Richard Dawson there.  He's blanking on the back of one of our guest's pants. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  How about damp clouded?  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, Cool Whipped on the back of her pants will not work.  Damp clouded.  Damp cloud.  It's a damp cloud.  Damp cloud.  Let's say hi to that.  Corey, she's from Long Island.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys today?  Good.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm hearing some of these comments, and some of them are a little horrific.  That Cool Whip was a little gross.  But every time I'm from Long Island, and every time I go into New York City on the subway, 
[01:23:30]  in some form or fashion, I get rubbed up on, touched.  But nothing is actually seen.  But the minute I get off the subway, it's hilarious.  Because people actually go out of their way in public to touch you and just be stupid.  And as long as nobody's Cool Whipping on me, I'm okay with it.  Cool Whip.  Or, in the words of Steve and S. from Bayshore, tadpolling.  Thank you.  Danita from Jersey.  What's up, Danita?  Hi. 
[01:24:00]  How you doing?  Hey, man.  You asked if it was hilarious or funny.  I think it's hilariously funny.  Because if you sit there, you can get him off you.  He doesn't have a knife or gun or anything like that.  You're fine.  Get up, walk away, and get over it.  That's a black woman talking, by the way.  It's really not.  It's like, mother...  I know you're not rubbing a bone.  And a white guy can't go, excuse me, ma'am.  I'm reaching for the pole.  I'll knock you in your face, man.  So, this is really a white woman's, oh, God, no, no. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, I believe that a black woman would handle it a little differently.  She's not going to listen to your...  It's not even a black person's conversation we should be even having.  She's not even going to listen to the excuse of Whitey and his business suit.  Pardon me, ma'am.  I'm just getting to the pole.  It's going to look like a scene with Queen Latifah in a movie.  Sucker!  You're trying to reverse-psychologize me?  You're on the pole.  I'll smack you.  Don't tell me you're trying to tadpole on me. 
[01:25:00]  Minus the swearing we can't say.  Oh, yeah.  There's no way.  No, right?  Oh, God.  Oh, God, no.  Let's say hi to Jenny in Maine.  Jenny?  Hey.  Jenny.  Who can I turn to?  What's up, Jenny?  So, when I lived in New York City, my girlfriend and I were sitting in Central Park, and we  noticed that down the hill, this guy was, as you say, helping himself. 
[01:25:30]  He was tadpaling.  Right?  He was tadpaling, yes.  Staring straight at us, and when we finally noticed, he was close to the top of the ladder,  shall we say.  Yeah.  And we stood up and started laughing so hysterically that you could actually see him blush from  down the hill.  Oh, really?  He probably loved it.  We just walked off laughing so hard, I'm sure that he never did that again.  Yeah, I think if you're in that position, you're going to do something crazy like that  in public.  You're hoping that you get a pretty horrific reaction, like, oh, my God. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  But if you start laughing, they're completely mortified.  You're ruining it.  You're ruining it for me.  Stop it.  This one is, you know, this is bad.  Upon exiting a train at Central Square, a man grabbed a woman, pinned her against the  wall.  Then he kissed her, put his hand under her shirt, pulled down her you-know-what that held  up her you-know-whats and you-know-what them.  That's bad.  She pleaded with him to stop and managed to break free.  That's just- 
[01:26:30]  That's just horrific.  Yeah, that is-  There's just no charm to that at all.  Yeah, yeah.  That is-  It doesn't have a humorous little twist to it.  The whole has a sort of something.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go to Barbara in Jersey.  Barbara.  Hi, guys.  I love you.  First of all, I just want to say that.  Barbara.  Well, you better get XM then.  Thanks.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  Oh, what's up, Barbara?  Well, a couple years ago, a friend of mine worked on the 33rd Street train headed to New  York for an audition.  So we're sitting there, we're getting ready, and we're putting our makeup, and next thing 
[01:27:00]  you know, this guy was next to me looking at the paper, and I'm looking in the reflection  of my mirror, and I see, I thought it was a thumb out of his zipper, and I'm thinking,  what the hell is that?  It was his penis.  And I'm like, oh my God.  This is turning into a train wreck.  I don't freak out.  I just stop, and I say to my friend, look at this.  And I gave her the mirror, and she's like, what?  I just look down, and she looks, and she sees, and she's like, we both jump up, and  we crack up laughing, which is, we don't, you know, scream or anything. 
[01:27:30]  And the guy knew that, you know, what he was doing, obviously.  He knew that we knew, so.  Was it to you, or in general, that the dude, was the dude doing it in general, or was it  Well, there was a lot of thumps there, basically.  She looked over, and there was something that was there that probably shouldn't be there,  if you're, probably, if you're on a train.  I know.  Oh, they let that fly.  That's nice.  Thank you.  So was it, what was it to you, miss?  I think, I think, Patrice, I think that the fact that he knew that we were going to sit 
[01:28:00]  next to him, that he was ready to go, you know, so.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  You know, and he was a white man.  Why is it always a white dude?  I mean, he's always, you know, I'm always hearing, and he's always a Caucasian guy.  Oh, my God.  We had a.  That guy's in the profile for that kind of thing.  We had an incident here in New York City, man, with a guy, white guy, I think he owned  a couple of restaurants, if I'm not mistaken, and he decides to expose himself late one 
[01:28:30]  night on the subway, just a regular white guy, for the most part, for the most part,  you know.  Yeah.  And he didn't have much of a record of doing this type of thing.  Right, right.  And the lady across the way pulled out her freaking cell phone and snapped a shot, and  it was on the front page of the paper.  Front page of the paper.  There he was, he had to come forward and say, yeah, it was me, and, oh, my God.  Can I say one last thing?  Yeah.  Okay, because I heard the show for a couple of days. 
[01:29:00]  I hear the show every morning, by the way.  Thank you.  But I just wanted to say, without cursing or anything, that Anthony's penis is so big,  you can make the balloon animal faster.  Thank you.  Oh, man, look at that.  That bit continues.  Nice.  Thank you, Barbara.  Have a great day.  Bye.  All right.  Somehow I don't mind Barbara from New Jersey coming up with a joke like that.  But when it's stupid Bob Kelly, it bothered me.  All right.  We got a few more, but we got to take a break.  So we're talking about the Perv line.  It's the red line up there in Boston.  A big story today.  It's on the front page of the paper. 
[01:29:30]  And we got a couple more incidents that happened.  There's two more really, really interesting ones we'll get to.  And the women, they're calling like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Stay on the line, girls.  Please stay on hold.  They're proving our point today.  Mm-hmm.  You know, in most cases, it looks ridiculous, and it's kind of funny to them.  It looks ridiculous.  Especially if they're with some of their friends.  Yeah.  When it's going on.  So please.  Really silly.  Please, women, stay on the phones for us, okay?  We need you today.  And if you've got a story, 877-212-ON-A. 
[01:30:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice, Tampa?  Yes, sir.  We got that in while I was eating eggs, right?  This weekend, yes, sir.  Thank you.  Say it again real fast.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, Tampa Improv, 813-864-4000 for tickets.  Thank you, sir.  Woman!  Wolf Mother.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, and lots of women calling our show.  A lot of brothers were down at the range yesterday. 
[01:30:30]  What?  What?  What's going on?  Patrice was just looking at one of my videos.  We're broadcasting.  Took down at the range.  It's on YouTube.  If you want to look, look up Anthony's FS2000.  Yeah.  And you'll get to see me shooting it off.  Is it legal to show that?  Yeah.  It's a range.  I'm at a legal range, and it's a legal gun.  He has.  If you play video games, the gun I'm looking at him fire.  Yeah.  Is the highest level gun you can collect. 
[01:31:00]  If you're collecting guns, like you get low level guns and some, you know, cheap rifle.  That's the gun.  That's the Mac Daddy.  To kill the bad guys.  The boss.  Yeah, yeah.  The boss.  At the end of the game.  That's a great gun.  And I went to the range last night and fired off a couple hundred rounds.  Oh, there's some.  It's up on YouTube.  I put a few clips up on YouTube.  Look at this gun.  And a lot of the brothers were down there at the range last night.  And I shoot at targets.  Was they looking at you like, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  One guy goes, damn, that looks like it's from a movie. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, man.  And I was shooting at like sighting targets.  They got targets on there.  It's a sheet of paper.  It's got about 10 or so little circles that are about the size of a silver dollar.  Every one of the black guys at the range was shooting at targets of people with the biggest  handguns I've ever seen in my life.  Boom, boom.  Just blowing holes in these posters of people. 
[01:32:00]  It's hysterical.  But they all dug the gun.  They liked that.  They were like, damn, what is that?  Everyone asks what it is.  It's an FS2000.  That's crazy, man.  They have the F2000, which is full automatic, but you're not allowed to own that.  So that's the civilian version.  Besides the army.  The military.  It's made in Belgium.  I asked Anthony this morning.  I go, aren't you getting sick of shooting at the targets?  He goes, yeah, I kind of am.  That's why I'm going to be hitting the streets soon.  He actually said that.  Hey, this is good.  But I don't want to lose these women.  No, keep the chicks on the phone.  Here we go.  They sat through a very long commercial break. 
[01:32:30]  We want to get to a few of these and see what it's all about here.  Let's say hi to Sam.  She's from PA.  What's up, Sam?  Well, I was just going to say that from what I hear, I would kind of like Anthony to expose  himself to me.  Wow.  Look at that, Anthony.  That's great.  Becoming legendary.  Good for my rep.  Yeah, sure.  Thank you.  Let's go to Ray in Westchester.  Ray, what's up?  A lot of guy names for girls.  What's that about?  What's up, Ray?  Hi, I want to say, I'm a 54-year-old Jewish mother, about 13 pounds overweight, and I 
[01:33:00]  think I'd be flattered, but if somebody did that to my daughter, I'd have to freaking  kill them.  Oh, see, you'd be flattered if it happened to you, but if it happened to your daughter,  I'd have to be.  That's a very reasonable statement.  She just made.  Yeah, I knew we weren't way off with this whole thing.  It does matter who it happens to, you know?  And I think...  Help me?  Huh?  Help me?  Oh, please say I'm hot.  I don't feel good about myself today.  Yes?  Oh, wow.  She nailed you. 
[01:33:30]  She got you.  She did really bad.  There I am hoping for a compliment.  That's why I do that gag, because I know how that feels.  Let's go to Jen in Brooklyn.  What's up, Jen?  Hey.  Hey.  So, a couple of my friends and I were downtown one night, and there was a guy following us,  and I noticed that he had his hands in his pocket, and there was quite a bit of movement  going on.  Jingling his change.  Oh, yeah.  Lots of change in there.  Then the grunting started, and the heavy breathing, and he started walking faster and faster. 
[01:34:00]  We were running down the street.  This guy is following us the entire time, hands still in his pants, and we ducked into  some sushi place with a big window, and he stood at the window and stared at us until  he was done.  That is, like, creepy.  Yeah.  Horrific.  And funny all at the same time, because the guy is running after you, jingling his change, 
[01:34:30]  grunting, and you're walking faster, and he's continuing.  I just can't get that whole mindset.  Like, how do you perform in that circumstance?  I don't know.  Do people realize this is like, there's a fine line between this being a horrific crime  and an SNL skit, right?  That's what we're trying to explain here today.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe.  Joe on Long Island.  What's up, Joe?  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Yeah.  Ever seen the videos of the subways in Japan where they got the guy with the stick pushing 
[01:35:00]  everybody in and making them like sardines?  Yeah.  Well, it got so out of hand there that they created women-only cars during rush hour.  They're pink cars, and during certain hours, there are no guys allowed whatsoever.  Oh, man.  I have a great joke, bud.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I was thinking.  It kind of got my mind going, too.  Wait.  Write down what you were going to say, and I'll write down what I was going to say.  Let's see if we have a match.  Do we have some match game music?  There's some match game music. 
[01:35:30]  I need a pen.  All right.  I'm writing my answer down.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Are you ready?  Almost.  All right.  All right.  See, we're not allowed to do Asian humor anymore.  And I truly believe there's a lot of Asians out there that should be pissed off at that. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know why they're being excluded from a comedy show.  Oh, see, I didn't go that way.  What?  You saw what I wrote already?  How'd you see what I wrote?  I didn't, but just from what you said, because I didn't make any type of Asian joke.  Even though it's...  All right.  Well, all right.  What do you got?  I wrote this.  Certain times of the...  I wrote this. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  Goddamn.  Those are funny.  See, if I was able to do Asian humor, people would actually think I was funny.  That's funny.  I went with a time of the month joke.  You went with a squeegee joke.  What?  Yes, Joe.  No, Joe.  Please.  I'm not feeling good about myself.  Yes, Joe.  If it makes you feel better, I think you're hot. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks.  I think.  All right, Joe.  What?  You know, in Mexico, they also have those female-only subway cars?  Really?  Yeah.  I was reading about that today.  I never even thought I would need to hear that.  Like, that's something I never thought of in my life, that they have just female-only things.  Yeah, right.  Because so many women get...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, where's yours?  It's harassed.  Why?  Where's your answer?  Really?  Yeah, yeah, because some of the PalTalk people want to see it. 
[01:37:30]  They really want to see it?  Yeah, yeah.  My humor?  They want to see the privileged people watching our program.  On the live cameras that we have here from PalTalk...  All right.  They'll get...  And what was the question?  It wasn't a question?  Yeah, it was like the female-only cars.  Subway cars in Japan, and there's a guy with a stick that, you know, shoves people into the subway car.  Right.  And there is...  Wait.  You have to...  Huh?  Yeah, there we go.  All right.  All right. 
[01:38:00]  There is more of a joke about...  Very good.  Getting a lot of laughs.  See, people, I could be funny.  See?  Oh, Pat from Munaki has a funny one.  It's just two simple words.  Boxcar.  Andrea, what's up?  Rehorio.  Hey, thank you.  Yes, what's up there?  I think you're hot.  Well.  Okay, here's the story. 
[01:38:30]  I used to work construction a long time ago, and I was on the red line, and a guy was rubbing up against me, and I just looked at him and went, are you serious?  And busted out laughing.  Right.  That's what happens, right?  For the most part?  Absolutely.  And Antonio.  Yes?  You are not paranoid.  Oh, thank you.  I knew.  You're welcome.  A little callback.  I knew.  I'd get some support there.  Have you seen that movie, Mr. Brooks? 
[01:39:00]  Mr. Brooks?  Yes, it's a classic.  And that's why you should have guns in your house.  Of course.  What about the one with Kevin Costner?  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  That's a classic?  That's a wreath.  I consider it a classic.  Oh, really?  I didn't see it.  Was it a good movie?  I like any Kevin Costner movie.  The preview looks really good on demand, but I just...  Is it good, Anthony?  Be honest.  Yeah.  I know Dane Cook's a friend of the show.  Is it a good movie?  Well, Dane's performance is, you know, Dane, but it's him not trying to be his normal wacky self. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  But, yeah.  I like it.  Okay.  So, basically, no.  I should watch Ratatouille again.  Ratatouille?  Ratatouille again.  I'm sure you see No Country for Old Men.  I saw.  Saw that.  Anthony just saw.  Man.  Good, right?  That gas station scene could be in the top scenes of all of them.  That is really a good one.  Right up there with Pulp Fiction, Sam Jackson in the diner.  Yeah.  We're going to be doing that.  That is good.  That little discussion they have back in Florida. 
[01:40:00]  That's your lucky coin.  That guy's just crazy.  I love him.  Me and Gavin was watching it, and all I can think of, right, when I was watching that scene  is you just go, I daydream about sometimes being the end of your life guy, just the guy  that all you have to do is go, how's your day?  Excuse me?  Excuse me?  And you just go, oh my God, no.  This is the end of my life guy.  This is the guy that's going to kill me because I said, how are you?  Hey, I'm just minding my own business, and here it is. 
[01:40:30]  I dream about being end of your life guy.  It's just, it's just, I dream of it.  I'd give up comedy to be that guy.  Yeah.  Just the end of your life guy.  No, sir, you can't come in here.  What?  What did you say?  Pardon?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  And then she realizes, like.  What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, what am I going to win?  Everything.  Everything.  Everything.  You've been betting it your whole life and just didn't know it.  Here it is.  Oh, dear.  You just don't know.  Here's the end of life guy. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, he ticked me today.  Damn.  Damn.  What time do you go to sleep?  You live in that house in the back?  You live in that house?  What if I come back and see you?  What?  Oh, damn.  What?  I'm the end of your life guy.  And then the fat lady in the office is like, he's not here.  Where's he at?  Where's Llewellyn?  Yeah.  He's not here.  And he looked like, you know, it's the end of your life.  Oh.  End of your life guy.  End of your life guy.  I'm sorry, man.  What a great movie that is. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  It really is.  That gas station scene.  The ending was, eh.  Eh.  I didn't understand it.  Eh.  Yeah.  When those years that.  They're trying to do that now in Hollywood.  They don't want the basic Hollywood ending anymore.  I don't get what.  We're going to be doing a coin toss thing on our show.  By the way.  What are you going to do?  Life or death.  We're going to be doing a little coin toss thing on our show.  A little tease.  No.  Don't put it.  Don't put it in your pocket.  Yeah.  Don't put it in your pocket.  Lucky coin.  Lucky coin.  We're going to be playing. 
[01:42:00]  We're going to be playing.  We're going to be playing.  Anthony, we're going to be playing.  Should we stay or should we go?  Toss the coin.  Sorry.  Anyway, getting back to the perv line.  It's a big story up there in Boston today.  Front page of the Boston Herald.  The red line is the line for the gropers out there for the pervs.  Yeah.  And you want me to read a couple more of these incidents that went down?  Yes.  Okay.  They're sexy.  On a crowded train on the way home from downtown Crossing to Fields Corner during rush hour 
[01:42:30]  one evening, a woman felt a man repeatedly rubbing his...  Well, we understand.  ...against her.  When she screamed, the man turned and began doing the same thing to another woman.  What?  It's like they're dogs.  It's that perv switch thing.  Yeah.  That we talk about.  There's girls around me.  Girls around me.  I can't stop.  Mm-hmm.  And then they just go like a dog.  You know when a dog comes up to you and does that?  And you're like, get out of here.  You shake your leg. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  It's like, what the...  It's the same thing the guy is doing.  Get out of here.  It's just the perv switch.  I mean, we all think crazy stuff when you're on a subway and you see something that you're  attracted to.  But then you just kind of keep it to yourself.  Other people, that perv switch goes off and that's it, man.  You appreciate the beauty of what you're looking at.  Right.  And you move on.  You think women would give up...  If they had to take a vote, quiet vote, most women would give up their right to be that 
[01:43:30]  kind of object that makes guys do that?  No way.  If you talk to a fatty or an ugly girl, something like that, she'd probably go, oh, yeah, yeah,  I'd give up, but hot girls, no way they love when guys look at them.  That's why they're dressed all sexy.  They know when they look good and they know guys are looking and it makes them feel good.  That is an absolute. 
[01:44:00]  Dress in a parka then every day.  Any of them go, this is a curse.  A curse?  A man.  Then don't buy the little skirt.  Don't put on the little tight shirt.  Don't put your hair in pigtails.  Don't wear your braces.  Don't make yourself look young.  Don't wear black and white shoes with bows on the front.  There's something going on in the workplace, you know.  I mean, cleavage is still a major turn-on to guys, but if you show a little too much appreciation 
[01:44:30]  for some girl walking around the office because she's got the cleavage hanging out,  you're in trouble with HR.  Big trouble.  You're in trouble.  And I'm not talking about getting aggressive or anything.  If your eyes go whoop and drop down a bit, you could get in a lot of trouble.  But for some reason, they're trying to say, no, women should be allowed to show off their  cleavage at work.  That kills us.  I say men and women shouldn't have to work together, just like these trains.  Women working with men is like a grizzly bear working with salmon dipped in honey. 
[01:45:00]  They think we can filter out this sexual urge, the sexuality out of, not even to the point  where the guy, like the guys in the subway cars doing, you know, what dogs do.  We're not even coming close to that.  I'm just talking about basic sexuality between men and women.  Not an appreciative grunt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, oom.  Just, oh.  Or an up and down.  A look up and down will get you in trouble in some circumstances at work. 
[01:45:30]  But that is the nature of who we are and what we are as human beings.  You can't stop that.  Right.  I always say this.  We're not Vulcans.  Right.  We're human beings and we're going to look at-  So what about the fact that, you know, devil's advocate, women are going to go, I should  be able to wear what I want, but where's the, ah, forget it.  You know what?  Was it supposed to be a line or something?  There's a destruction of madness that-  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about that with Nick DiPaolo.  It's a destruction of what we are. 
[01:46:00]  Masculinity and madness.  And women don't understand, in the long run, they feel less like women the more we lose  madness, they're going to wonder what is going on.  Where are the men?  Yeah.  Where is the guy that makes me feel, like, giggly?  Right.  Because you're taking it.  Because I can't be a piece of garbage.  Right.  Let's go to Kat in New York.  Kat, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got the ultimate Charles River pink panty pervert in the park story.  Okay.  I see what you want to say, and it's a good story.  Just try to kind of talk around the parks that will get us in trouble. 
[01:46:30]  What the guy was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't use the words I'm reading.  Yeah.  Okay, I got you.  So, my girlfriend and I are running, which I have to say, I don't think we were totally  asking for it.  I mean, we're running, but, you know, we're not at a bar.  So, I think that's the part where you're like, that's where you draw the line.  It's when it comes at you and you're not expecting it.  The idea of sweat.  Can I go off on a tangent for one second?  I've been an athlete my whole life, and I like to work out.  I like to go to the gym and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  And I curse the people that came up with the athletic wear for women.  Why?  Because you guys couldn't look less sexier.  The sports bra should just be banned.  Dude, there was a time, man, when you saw girls, like, working out or playing a sport.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, there was stuff going on.  Now, everything is just tightly pushed together.  Batten down the hatches.  It's all battened down.  Yep.  There's nothing sexy about it.  What's that? 
[01:47:30]  It's really for utility.  We're not looking for it.  I know, but it sucks.  We're looking to get our work out in.  I understand that.  I just don't want to be bothered by exercising.  God.  And somebody made an outfit for you not to be bothered.  I think it was some feminist Nazis that came up with the sportswear for women, and I curse  them today.  There was a time there was a girl, she might be, you know, ample, and she really wanted  to lose a few pounds, and man, there was a struggle, man. 
[01:48:00]  There's a loose t-shirt and a loose bra underneath.  How long have you been doing?  20 years?  20?  A long time?  I'm barely out of college.  How long?  Let me tell you something.  A woman can just have her equipment, and it's the same thing as being a celebrity.  What I have to work 20 years to be, women walk out and feel that way, like, oh, God,  I'm going to dress as awful as possible so I don't get bothered today from my fans.  Fans, which are fans of hotness. 
[01:48:30]  It's just, you're just arbitrary.  That's what you are.  And she's, I just, we're out jogging, and here he comes bothering us.  Autographs, numbers, why?  He asked me the time, and I'm like, oh, my God, there's a big clock in the middle of  the road.  You can't see it there.  By the way.  Would you suppose if I could work out in, like, a burlap sack and you would leave me  alone at the gym?  Nobody will.  Don't you get it?  You're an object. 
[01:49:00]  Look, I look around my gym, it's like, man, these freaking athletic crap for women suck.  Steven asked for Bayshore.  He does a great job at the rundown on onaradio.com.  Find some old shots of women working out in, like, I think the prime is, like, the late  70s when women decided they wanted to be like men as well and start working out and taking  care of themselves.  Yeah.  And they start hitting the gym and lifting a few pounds here and there.  Early 80s, too.  Early 80s.  When they would put the, on Showtime, they'd put the girls stretching and doing, like, 
[01:49:30]  the light calisthenics on that turntable, the rotary table, and you'd sit there and just  watch that for hours.  Oh, yeah, you would.  They didn't have a problem with surrendering being an object to men.  Yeah.  Now they want to control when they're an object and control when I'm supposed to be turned  on.  It's an on-off switch.  It's not a dimmer.  You can't control it.  It's not a dimmer, but you're out for, you're out at the gym or you're out for a run like  we were, and it just doesn't, it shocks you. 
[01:50:00]  It's the shock value of just, I mean, when you're in a bar and you're out, it doesn't  shock you when a guy's on-off switch.  Really?  You want to be in control of when I'm horny?  I can be horny any time I want.  Cat seems pretty cool, actually.  I don't want it.  Hey, Cat, get back.  Just get back to your story.  We're back on the highway.  All right.  We filled up.  We got some coffee.  We're back on the highway.  Let's go.  So you're jogging along with your girlfriend.  So we're jogging along, and we're way into our run.  It's like the last thing you're thinking about, but we run by this park bench, and we're pretty 
[01:50:30]  much past the guy when we both, like it kind of clicks into our head what we just saw.  And he's sitting there in shorts, sitting down, so you can't really see the whole, you  can't really see the whole scene, but we saw the whole scene and what was going on.  And we went past him, and I screamed to him something like, get a stinking life.  And so I was like, oh, man, come on.  Like, come just out for a run, for God's sake.  Like, really? 
[01:51:00]  Did you explain what was going on?  I don't think so.  You didn't explain what was going on.  Basically, the guy was in a pink thong, and he was, you know, he was doing his thing.  Sitting there, yeah.  As you were jogged by.  Yeah, he was having a moment with himself, but he wasn't with himself and home in his  bed.  He was on the park bench on the Charles River.  Gotcha.  So we've passed him, and we think, like, oh, get over yourself.  Like, that's disgusting.  And then I'm like, no, man, this is my neighborhood.  This is where I live.  Right.  So I'm like, we should call the police.  We'll call when we get home.  Right.  We call him.  Right.  The cops come find us.  Right. 
[01:51:30]  And they go find him, and he's still excited when the cops find him.  Right.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  Right.  But we couldn't identify him, because of course we weren't paying attention to him.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My point is...  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Quiet, quiet.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha. 
[01:52:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Shut up.  We give you a C-plush for your phone call.  Not a failing grade, but because the effort was there.  Yeah, it was good.  Lauren, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good, Lauren.  I was just calling about the whole hot girls like to be looked at remark.  Yeah.  I just don't agree with that.  I mean, I've worked in bars and restaurants my entire life,  and it closes me out when guys stare like...  Okay, hold the phone.  All right, there's a couple things going on. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Are you hot?  Yes.  Now, you worked in bars and restaurants.  Now, you probably had to dress a certain way to get tips, right?  Oh, no, not at all.  Stop it.  You did, too.  If you work in a bar...  All the hot girls who come in in the low-cut show...  Oh, God.  I think every single person listening to our voices  likes when someone looks at you in that way.  Exactly.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of...  It makes your day.  You're like, I think that girl thought I was hot. 
[01:53:00]  I'm just going to put on...  That's such...  I think you're lying, Lauren.  Headphones.  I don't like...  Sunglasses.  And I'm going to put on...  Imagine you naked.  It's like it feels...  Oh, it's so ugly.  It's ugly.  Everybody wants to feel that they're attractive.  Don't bother me.  Let me ask you a question.  You can imagine them naked in...  Let me ask you a question.  If you had some type of accident that made you not sexy no more, what now are you?  Yeah, imagine that, right?  She's still there?  Lauren?  Hello?  If you had some type of deforming situation, maybe like Kevin Spacey got to you in 7, like 
[01:53:30]  removed your nose, right?  And now you're ugly.  Now you're horrific.  It's not...  Wait a minute.  Time out.  What are you after you're not sexy anymore?  What are you?  Yeah, I don't even think she's sexy.  I think Lauren's not that good looking and she's mad because the other women around her  get looked at.  Is that it?  But what I'm saying, what are you beyond your looks that is such a curse and it makes you 
[01:54:00]  sick?  If men stopped looking at you like that, what then would you be to me?  Normal.  A normal, chopped up, ugly woman.  Not wanting to get stared at.  So no one wanting you sexually now is like, it makes it better for you?  Yeah, I would prefer nobody wanting me sexually.  So what do you wear out?  Do you wear anything kind of sexy looking, nice? 
[01:54:30]  Do you take time to make yourself look good in the mirror and put on makeup, do your hair?  I'm pretty much a tomboy.  I wear like jeans and a t-shirt everywhere.  Just so you don't get bothered sexually, right?  What's your MySpace?  That's a good idea.  Or your Facebook.  What do you got?  Let's take a look-see.  And we'll be honest.  If you're hot...  MySpace.com slash Rub-A-Dub Square.  I guarantee you she's...  I'm going to say...  In stripping things.  This is a setup. 
[01:55:00]  She looks good.  I freaking hate that.  All right, this is you.  I go to school in Boston and we got Esco-Holans everywhere.  The girls in the miniskirts with the Ugg boots.  All right, the first picture, but it looks more like a MySpace picture where you're covering  up stuff, but the first picture I see, you look all right.  Where's all the pictures of you?  I don't know.  You got a private thing, so now we got a...  Ah, damn.  Let me look.  Okay.  You got one of those kind of Russian winter hats on.  All right.  You look...  I mean, from the little bit that you're allowing us to see, you look all right.  She could be cute.  She says she's 20. 
[01:55:30]  20?  She's been working in the bar thing for years?  She's lying.  No.  What happened?  What bar are you working at 20 for years?  I work...  No.  I actually just started at Boston Beer Works, but I've been working in restaurants since  I was 13, and I've been serving alcohol since I was 17.  Delicious.  Nice.  Just from the small picture that's allowed up here that we can see, because you don't  want anybody in there unless you're on the friends list.  In the MySpace world, you're easily an eight, but that doesn't mean you're an eight in real 
[01:56:00]  life.  That's one picture.  That's one picture.  You can't go by the picture.  I need another picture.  Yeah, it's a side view.  I mean, it's a very strategic...  You're wearing a wacky fur hat.  Yeah.  Half of everything is covered up.  Well, it's a MySpace thing.  Girls know how to get their picture just right to look good.  I'm the girl next door.  You're the girl next door?  You do have a hot voice, by the way.  Huh?  You have a hot voice.  It's from being in smoky bars her whole life.  Yeah.  Just breathing in smoke. 
[01:56:30]  It made it a little raspy.  Cancer.  Look, I just gave her a compliment, and she goes, thank you.  See, you're just like anyone else.  That made you happy.  The raspy cigarette voice.  Yeah.  I don't mind you guys, because I know you.  It's the rest of them dudes.  No.  She knows us.  You got a boyfriend?  No.  She doesn't want to admit it, because...  No?  Something happened.  She's in bars.  She's working in restaurants since she was 13.  Something happened.  Listen, we got to take a break there.  No, that's the brook's meow.  Oh, she didn't answer me.  Do you have a boyfriend?  Do you admit to having...  I do have a boyfriend. 
[01:57:00]  And do you dress nice for him and everything?  No.  He's miserable.  No.  He buys me things, and I'll wear them for him.  Oh, he is.  She's...  This guy is miserable.  All right.  Listen, we got to take a break.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Now everyone is calling saying you're full of crap.  We got more women calling.  It's Women Day.  It's great.  It's like The View today.  How about it's Women Tuesday?  Oh, I like that.  It's the women millennia.  It's the millennium for women.  They're running things now.  Yeah.  New bit for the show. 
[01:57:30]  Slit Tuesday.  All right.  Write it down.  Put it on your calendars.  Punch it into your little notebooks.  I'll tell you this much.  It's refreshing to hear from the women that listen to this dumb show.  Yeah.  And we got more of them on hold.  We'll talk to them next, okay?  You know what?  She's been waiting.  Antoinette from Queens.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  First of all.  Hey, how is the Rick Springfield show? 
[01:58:00]  I like it.  What's her name, Antoinette?  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  Thank you for that.  Anyway, what's up?  First of all, that split Tuesday, that was absolutely foul that you just said that.  Oh.  How about lemon slits?  You know, about batting down the hatches.  She told me.  Yeah.  When girls are in gyms and whatnot.  Yes.  You know, I understand that back in the 70s, everybody wore those nice little gym shorts  and whatnot.  But, you know, if you had a couple pounds in front of you up top and they were bouncing 
[01:58:30]  around slapping you in the face, it would bother you a little bit.  It didn't bother Suzanne Summers.  But it bothers you.  It doesn't bother me.  It's kind of cool to check out.  That's all I was saying.  God.  If you can hear her voice, she is.  Oh, my God.  We're going to have a problem, Antoinette, so let's just go our own ways.  You can hear Antoinette.  Now she's like, if you had big boobs, that's not what I was getting at.  I don't care what kind of pain you're in.  Can I say this?  Because you've got big boobies.  Can you just blame God for your problems? 
[01:59:00]  I have nothing to do with it.  Right.  That's not special because God made you that.  We didn't think this up on our own, that we're going to look at girls and find them attractive  and stare a little bit or give the proving grunt.  It's like, if you had big boobs like I do, you wouldn't appreciate the back pain that  I have to walk around with.  Whatever.  I'm just taking a look.  Be quiet.  Sorry.  By the way, someone who lingers longer, yes, it's MySpace voodoo. 
[01:59:30]  As far as the MySpace pictures, we discussed MySpace voodoo on a past show.  And also someone's coming up with a great idea.  It went by, I don't know, a half hour, 40 minutes ago.  Let's get tadpolling the number one search on Google today.  Today's word is tadpolling.  Tadpolling.  Tadpolling will be the number one search on Google Trends a little later today.  Let's start searching.  Tadpolling.  We're going to finish the show next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bob Kelly here.  January 30th, I'm going to be at the Rhode Island Comedy Connection. 
[02:00:00]  That's a Wednesday night.  And what did you write down?  January 30th?  Okay, here we go.  Do it again.  What's going on, Bob Kelly here?  That's right.  Bob Kelly.  I want you to come down and see me.  Rhode Island Comedy Connection.  January 30th.  Kowloon's Comedy Connection.  And Saugus, Mass.  January 31st.  And February 1st and 2nd, I'll be at the Boston Comedy Connection.  Come on down and have the laughs around.  Oh, shit. 
[02:00:30]  Darling, leave a light on for me.  I'll be there before you close the door.  To give you all the love that you need.  Darling, leave a light on for me.  Because when...  All right.  All right.  Oh, Antoinette is back.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi. 
[02:01:00]  Antoinette, what's up?  Nothing.  I mean, you just hung up on me before I could say anything else.  You didn't know what I was going to say next.  Yeah.  But I don't really care if you got big boobs and it's uncomfortable if you're in a gym.  I don't have a big chest that would bounce up and slap me in the face.  All I was going to say is that there is absolutely nothing sexy about a huge chest bouncing up and down.  Even when you watch porn, there's nothing sexy about that.  Wait a minute.  Can you...  You're so not a guy.  Listen, can you miss, Antoinette?  Can you possibly just have an opinion and not let your opinion have you? 
[02:01:30]  You're so not a guy.  Why would you say that?  That's so dismissive.  What?  That's so dismissive of the animal you're talking to.  I'll agree.  I'll agree with her.  I don't find that really attractive, like the big, nasty breastesses just like kind of moving around while they're working out.  But, Antoinette, if you're saying that nobody likes big boobs bouncing around in like pornos, then you're just talking crazy. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, you're just...  I'm not saying nobody likes that, but when O.P. is about working out, I mean, come on, you know, watch a chick with a huge chest.  Yes!  Well, hold on a minute.  First of all, it's not just going to the gym and seeing a girl, you know, with a huge chest working out.  I'm just saying the clothing in general that women wear to work out sucks.  There's nothing sexy about it whatsoever.  You went right for the big boob thing.  That's part of it, I guess, to see a little movement in general.  Somebody brought it up on PalTalk here who's calling it, it makes a uniboob. 
[02:02:30]  Yes!  You just squish it all together.  And you know the part on a breast that you kind of, you could see it through the clothing?  Mm-hmm.  Those things become completely cockeyed through a sports bra.  Yeah.  And you could see it, and it's like, what the hell is that?  It's like staring at Marty Feldman's face.  Women pretty much wear girdles in the gym.  Everything is just kind of tightly, you know, held, packed in place. 
[02:03:00]  And there was a time, I think back to high school, and the girls would have to run around the track,  and they had the little, you know, the high school t-shirt, standard t-shirt they had to wear,  and some little short shorts.  And that was quite nice to check out.  I'm into the let's get physical phase of the workout.  God, I like the little headband, leg warmers, and a satin leotard.  Oh, the leotard.  The leotard started it, by the way.  Before that, it was like just a t-shirt and shorts, just like what guys would wear to the gym.  It was silly.  And then they invented the leotard, and then there was no stopping them. 
[02:03:30]  Cut way up on the hips.  I hate that look, yeah.  Little spandex.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Spandex.  That's fine, because, you know, like, when I see a hot woman, yeah, I check her out.  I notice that she's hot.  I was just commenting on, you know, the rest of that.  We understand.  All right.  We understand.  It's a tough world.  Let's just all relax, take a deep breath.  You go to work, and we'll finish our radio show.  It's hilarious, too, that men just don't have these issues. 
[02:04:00]  Like, you just, you don't hear us going, why, why?  My pecs are making this woman lose her mind.  Check the fuzz.  It's terrible.  It's just not a part of our existence to be in trouble for being an object.  Even though I'm not an object type of guy, but even an object type of dude is, like,  not going, why me, Lord?  Let's get more of these ladies on the air.  They've been holding for a while.  We got Nikki from Cape Cod.  Cape Cod is a hotbed of activity for Opie and Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  I don't know what the hell's going on in Cape Cod, but it seems that a bunch of people  are checking out this show.  What's up, Nikki?  What a chasing jaws.  Hi, how are you?  What's up, Nikki?  Nikki.  I said, hi, how are you?  I was just calling to say the double standard.  Yeah?  Like, women want to be checked out by hot guys.  They don't want to be checked out by gross guys.  Ah, okay.  See, there's the ticky.  Can I tell you something?  When a girl, like, checks me out, I don't care if she's ugly.  I don't care if she's missing an arm or a leg.  I don't care.  I just don't care if it looks like she got hit in the face with a frying pan. 
[02:05:00]  It's just flattering.  It's just flattering when a girl of the opposite sex.  A girl of the opposite sexual persuasion of a female.  Right.  When someone of the opposite sex checks you out, it's flattering.  No matter who you are.  Yeah.  Would you rather have a hot, like in your case, a hot guy check you out?  Or, I don't know, it's a little more exciting when a hot girl checks me out. 
[02:05:30]  Absolutely.  Oh, a little more?  It's a lot better.  Oh, it's 100%.  I tend to attract, I've noticed that signings and things, I tend to attract fatties.  I don't think I've brought this up on the air before.  No.  But for some reason, when we go out and about to various appearances, bars, our road shows, 
[02:06:00]  the virus tour, I attract fat girls.  They love me.  Just for you.  Like, meaning that it's not just, oh, they're fat and they're attracted to any guy.  And they don't just like, you know, oh, I'm a fan of the show.  They're like, oh, my God, I like Anthony.  You're Italian, dude.  No, I don't, I'm not a fan of the fat girl.  I mean, I appreciate the effort and everything.  I'm not a fan of the fat girl.  I appreciate it.  How do you use that?  Young fatties, all fatties across the board? 
[02:06:30]  Young fatties, better than old fatty.  Yeah, yeah.  Because Italian women, I mean, women like Italian guys because they have a flavor.  I'm not into Italian broads.  But they like you because I think there's a flavor there that's not just a regular white guy.  You got a darkness, too.  Stop being racist, Patrice.  I didn't say, I said.  You just assume every Italian guy, you know, has hot, you know, Italian chicks checking  them out?  No.  I just, you know, I like to be in an appearance and have just a real hot girl. 
[02:07:00]  If we're going to be honest, what I attract is complete psychopaths.  Psychopaths.  Complete insane psychopaths.  Where their eyes are like pinwheels when they come up to me.  And who's the one that attracts the cute girls that come up to the table?  Who's the one that attracts the cute girls?  Jimmy gets the shy, cute girls.  F'n Jimmy Norton gets the shy, cute girls.  Is the sickest, most perverse bastard on the face of the earth. 
[02:07:30]  And he's the one with the hot girls that come up to him and, you know, I love you.  Take my picture.  That's very safe.  Safe.  Jimmy, that's why Jimmy gets over with that whole little perv thing.  Yeah.  Because he's just a little perv and it's cute.  But it's real.  Do these girls think he's faking it?  Yeah, you can knock Jimmy out, though, if you're a woman.  Let's go to Jersey.  Jennifer in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I think these girls that are calling saying that they don't like when men look at them  are absolutely insane. 
[02:08:00]  They must be lesbians.  Because when you take time out of your day to look good, it's not so that you can look  good for yourself.  You want to look good for other men.  I mean, when I get up in the morning and I look good, it's for my guy.  And these women are all crazy.  They must be lesbians.  They're absolutely insane.  Yeah, girls, when they really put themselves together, it's so they look good when they  go out.  It's not for themselves.  I just want to feel good about myself.  Add up.  You're hoping to get a couple looks.  Yeah, you're hoping to get some looks.  We all are hoping for a couple looks. 
[02:08:30]  That's what everyone wants.  It's part of human nature.  Don't try to avoid it.  It doesn't mean you're cheating on your girl or any of that crap.  You're just hoping for a couple looks during your day.  It's human nature.  Go home and feel good about yourself.  Listen, speaking of this, we got this clip.  It's terrific.  This is making its way around the internet, but I'm sure you've...  It's the internet.  Maybe we're turning some people on to this today.  Musclehead is impressed with himself.  Listen to this.  This is really funny. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, look at these muscles, man.  Yep.  What a tool.  20-inch biceps.  20-inch fat.  I mean, these traps, man.  This is one massive man. 
[02:09:30]  I'm eating french fried potatoes.  All right, if he's going to be bragging, why isn't he talking about how many centimeters  he's got because of the...  You know what I mean?  He's been doing some of the juice to get that body where he's impressed by it, obviously.  Oh, you think maybe he's got some shrinkage because of the...  Oh, absolutely.  I'd like to see what this dude looks like.  Yeah, where is he?  Did you see him?  It's one of the top videos.  It's definitely one of the viral videos that is making the rounds.  He gets even more excited as he continues.  This is huge nipples, man.  I just look at this muscle, man. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, God, it's so beautiful.  Oh, God, you'd be so f***ing big.  Oh, I just f***ed...  Oh, God, I could get all for myself.  Just look at this body, man.  Oh, wow.  That guy really appreciates himself.  What do we thank today for that?  Break.com, I'm thinking?  I think I saw it there. 
[02:10:30]  Front page?  That's...  Front page yesterday, so...  He likes himself.  That's good.  Self-esteem.  Go in a page or two and you'll find it for yourself.  We'll link it on onaradio.com.  Let's say hi to Heidi.  There's a lot of women calling in, but we're running out of show here.  Heidi, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I just want to say that I totally agree with you.  I live for those cat calls.  It makes my day.  There you go.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And I do it for guys, too.  When I see somebody jogging on a side road, I'll beep it down.  And they love it.  They wave back. 
[02:11:00]  You little slut.  I love it.  Love it.  What do you wear, like, to attract looks?  I'll just, you know, do my hair.  I mean, I think I'm pretty good looking and do my hair and wear nice clothes and strut my stuff.  Yeah, you've got to turn off that Beth Page accent.  I want to say about that sports bra.  Yeah.  You totally need it when you work out.  I mean, I can't.  I have to hold. 
[02:11:30]  But that's not what.  Girls worked out before they were invented.  Yeah, I get all that.  I'm sure it makes it a lot easier for you.  But sorry.  We're seeing the video of the guy now.  That's the guy.  Go to break or later on we'll have it linked up on O&A Radio.  Yeah, the guy is just a tool.  He's a complete tool.  If you don't wear a sports bra and you work out, you're going to get stretch marks when you get older.  You have to.  Yeah, but I'm not marrying the girl that I'm admiring at the gym.  I'm just taking a look.  And the sports bra makes it very unsexy. 
[02:12:00]  Very intrusive.  Yeah.  It's getting in the way.  My husband loves himself.  All right.  That's good.  That's all that matters.  And Opie, I know your brother, Indy.  Indy?  Indiana Jones?  Oh, yeah.  My brother.  Okay.  He's the only Indy I know.  How do you know him?  I worked at DEC with him.  Very cool.  Yeah, great guy.  Four kids.  Yeah.  I know.  He's a terrific man.  All right.  Thanks, Heidi.  Okay, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Really?  You sure?  All right.  I guess that's it. 
[02:12:30]  Thanks, Patrice.  My husband loves him.  Did we get anything done today?  Oh, I think so.  We tackled some of the biggest issues facing our country today.  Sexism.  Sex and racism.  Yep.  Perverts.  That's pretty much it.  And the Super Bowl.  Opian-isms.  That's the name of the show.  Opian-ism.  It's ism Tuesday.  We couldn't even play What Did We Learn on the Opinant Anthony Show today.  By the way, getting back to the subway thing. 
[02:13:00]  Sean from Buffalo writes, oh, my God, guys.  Louis C.K., who was supposed to be in today, but he's got the flu, and he did the right thing  and stayed home, so we don't get the flu.  So, he covered this in his shameless special.  These guys aren't pervs.  They're married men with no place at home to love themselves.  Hmm.  So, they go on a train.  Right.  All right.  Oh, yes.  Of course, Patrice.  Patrice is going to be in Tampa for everybody in the Tampa area.  Yeah.  Tampa Improv this weekend.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, January 31st. 
[02:13:30]  And Friday and Saturday, the beginnings of Black History Month.  Oh.  The two beginning days of Black History Month.  Go, Obama.  Go, Barack.  Oh, this sucks.  We'll celebrate.  That we get this fine call as we're leaving.  Nicole, Boston, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  So, I lived in an apartment complex, and this guy who lived on the side of me with his girlfriend  used to go to the window in the morning and show himself to me as I was going to my car. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  On purpose?  Like, he would make sure he was showing you?  Yes.  He was a creepy guy, and the walls were kind of thin.  He could hear when I was going out to my car.  He would purposely go to the window and flash me.  Would that bother you?  You know, it was kind of creepy because he lived right next door, and he would know that  he, like, when I was coming in, when I was leaving.  So, that was the part that bothered me, and that his girlfriend lived with him, and she 
[02:14:30]  was such a nice girl.  Was it a turn on at all, knowing that some guy went out of his way to kind of?  You know what I mean?  The guy was being nice.  Went out of his way and everything.  No, we got past the creepy part.  It's obviously creepy.  It is kind of creepy.  You know, I don't know.  Maybe it is a double standard.  Creepy when guy does it.  Hot when girl does it.  Oh, God.  It's just...  See, that's what's so funny about...  Do I have to spell out how we're different? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, just switch the roles.  You're going to work.  A guy is going to work, and a girl is running to the window every day to make sure she exposes  it.  First of all, guy isn't going to work anymore.  He's standing there trying to figure out what the hell.  Throwing rocks at the window, ringing the doorbell, trying to get in there.  I know what that means.  I know what that means.  She wouldn't be at the window if she didn't want it.  Right.  Meanwhile, girl, I call the police.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:15:30]  We do.  We're truly from different planets.  Absolutely.  All right, Nicole.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  You're ready.  E-Rock, get us out of here.  Yeah.  Bye.  Bye.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  When's the last time you went to OpieandAnthony.com?  Holy shit.  It's been that long?  Well, get the fuck over there right now.  We just added a brand new section called Old School Opie and Anthony.  It's going to be old bits. 
[02:16:00]  It could be from our CDs that we released.  I'm scared.  It could be old publicity shots.  All that crap.  Oh, no.  No.  So there's all brand new shit that's going to be highlighted every fucking day on OpieandAnthony.com.  So go there now.  Saturday, February 2nd at 9 p.m. Eastern.  The Saturday Night Virus presents the return of weird medicine with Dr. Steve.  I've got this little blob.  It's almost like a little growing third nut.  Listen in as Dr. Steve and his wacky sidekick, P.A. John, answer medical questions about your awful body parts live on the air for a national audience. 
[02:16:30]  I can't come unless she does it.  Okay.  Does that make me gay?  Don't miss the return of weird medicine Saturday, February 2nd at 9 p.m. Eastern on the Saturday Night Virus. 
[02:17:00]  I can't come unless she does it. 
[02:17:30]  I can't come unless she does it. 
[02:18:00]  I can't come unless she does it. 
[02:18:30]  I can't come unless she does it.  I can't come unless she does it.  No, it's şeyler.  I can't come unless she does it.  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll get into the whole thing one of these days.  Fun, fun, fun.  The stupid doorman, they're becoming more and more powerful, though.  Yes, it actually goes.  President, vice president, speaker of the house, doorman.  So a lousy little machine they wouldn't let out of the building?  Like someone's going to rob an office building during the day.  It's obvious that it's part of just day-to-day business. 
[02:22:00]  Obvious to everyone except the doorman who's on a power trip.  You have to move equipment.  And needs to kind of show that he's in charge or something.  It's a piece of equipment.  What does he think?  That's being stolen?  After 9-11, they were given this power.  They were given this power that people actually had to listen to for some reason.  Yeah.  Remember when you had to sign in to every single fucking building you went into?  You actually had it.  It didn't matter.  You worked there.  You didn't work there.  You had to sign in and show ID. 
[02:22:30]  And the doorman's looking it over like he's going to thwart some kind of a fucking plot.  Yeah.  Die.  Hey, when are they going to fix the console?  I mean, we had this state-of-the-art console that went up and down.  Like, reeeeee.  Yeah, you can get the perfect height.  And it broke after, like, the first weekend.  Yeah.  Are they ever going to fix it?  It broke on low.  Yeah, it's way too low.  And it's not comfortable.  Mars, what do you got on that?  Um, it takes 20 days to get fixed.  I don't know why. 
[02:23:00]  20 days.  Yes, that was a turnaround.  20 plus.  Well, I feel like...  And they have it.  Ant's got the...  Ant just say, you got eight.  Like a movie.  It's going to take 20 days.  You got eight.  This is...  No?  20?  All right.  Never works like that.  This is the difference between you and I.  I feel like you'll make it better.  The dude from Fast Times at Ridgemont High in the restaurant.  Oh, right.  That's all.  When poor rat is sitting there at the table.  And the table's a little too high for him?  With, yeah.  Yeah, this thing needs to be...  With his chick there and... 
[02:23:30]  This needs to be lowered.  Yeah, it really does.  No, Opie, you won't get into it later.  You never do.  Fast Freddy.  I sort of do.  Of course.  Uh, all right.  And then we thought Patrice left us, but he's here.  Yeah.  I thought the racism got to him and he decided...  No.  ...call it a day or something.  No.  Patrice...  What you know is I'm no more racist than black people are.  Right?  Fucks no. 
[02:24:00]  What?  That's the weird thing.  Like, uh...  Most people don't understand that black people can be racist, too.  I don't think a lot of people understand that.  No, you can't be racist unless you have power.  We are the most racist, to be honest.  Really?  Oh, we are.  We just treat people like dog shit.  Oh.  You're even racist.  It races against lighter-skinned black people.  That's the one that really amazes me.  We are the meanest group of motherfuckers you'll ever meet.  I don't just...  I just don't know how our feelings get hurt so bad. 
[02:24:30]  I know.  Along with Asians.  Like, they're the meanest mother...  Yeah.  Where I live, they're the meanest, most impatient, doesn't speak English motherfuckers I've ever  seen.  Yeah.  I feel sorry for your mother.  I was just mean, y'all.  I can't understand how people are so mean.  Puerto Ricans, mean.  Some old Puerto Rican woman?  Yeah.  Mean.  Just mean.  You're the meanest motherfucker you've ever seen.  I know.  White people are the only really nice people.  You're racist. 
[02:25:00]  Like, white people...  No lie.  You're racist.  I mean, other than the redneck in silly somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Nebraska.  But for the most part, white people are nice.  Well, yeah, we try.  Before it goes by, in the paper today, listen to this.  Yes.  It's in the gossip column, which means that they're not brave enough to name names.  They make it very, very kind of obscure. 
[02:25:30]  No vague.  Vague.  You got to figure it out on your own.  Bunch of pussies that are the gossip column writers.  Gate Crasher, he writes, which reality show clogged network?  So they're not brave enough to say MTV or VH1?  It was Fox.  They're not even brave enough to say MTV or VH1.  They have to say which reality show clogged network had to change its casting procedures  after a racist internal policy was leaked. 
[02:26:00]  You want to guess what that racist internal policy was?  Wait a minute.  I think I know this one.  Did you read it today?  If you read it, don't play along.  No, I didn't read it today.  I didn't read it today.  I think I heard about it, though.  They, isn't it, ah, which reality show clogged network had to change its casting procedures  after a racist internal policy was leaked?  Oh, I can't remember.  It had to be Flavor Flav and probably hiring, you know, black people who can actually speak. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, really?  Uh, no.  Okay.  You got an answer?  Yeah, but I was just trying to make it into a thing instead of just reading this dumb thing.  I'm trying to...  There's so many things it could be.  It rings a bell, because I remember somebody saying there was a, uh, I read something about  some casting, and they were saying they wanted a certain type of person.  You're getting close.  The black people that they were getting, the loud mouth kind of, almost like the Jerry Springer type. 
[02:27:00]  They don't want that.  You're pretty much have it.  Producers had an informal ban on considering cast members who were too black.  Hmm.  They didn't want the too black.  What show?  I don't know, because they're not brave enough to fucking name the show, Patrice, or the  network.  Why wouldn't they?  Come on.  They claimed it was because darker skin tones were hard to pick up on camera.  Well, there is different lighting for black people. 
[02:27:30]  Sorry, I don't mean to laugh.  That's just horrible.  It's a lighting nightmare.  But, like, filming Blade must have been just a fucking bitch.  It's, there are lighting issues.  So, it's a little easier these days.  Yeah.  Um, but remember, like, in the, the oldie days, watching TV, and people, black people  would come on TV, and you're like, I can't even see this person, because the TV is so 
[02:28:00]  bad, and, you know, the lighting sucked.  Sammy Davis, I don't even know what he looks like.  All right, well, that was just a quick thing, whatever, it was just, whatever.  Hey, we got more.  More racism.  We got more clips from the State of the Union that was all over the TV last night.  Just a couple highlights.  Bush's last day of the Union.  Yeah, but he's going to still be sitting there for how long?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God. 
[02:28:30]  Too long.  Just time for something different.  Yeah, not too much change.  All right, we're never too far away from that.  That's what I love about this whole thing.  It's just bubbling under the surface with Anthony.  Just percolating.  Oh, he pays attention very closely these days.  Doesn't want us to slip in some support for Obama in any shape or way.  Well, here's, here's more clips from the State of the Union last night with President Bush. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, look at his muscles, man.  He's digging himself.  Have you ever seen this much muscle right now?  56-inch pounds, man.  20-inch biceps.  And 20-inch neck.  And his traps, man.  This is one massive man. 
[02:29:30]  What a loser.  Jimmy, would you say this guy likes himself?  Wish Jimmy was here.  Yeah.  What would he say?  He would say, yeah, I think he likes himself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Love when he does that.  That's all he would say.  If you think about it, really.  Yeah, this guy loves muscles.  A little Jimmy for everybody.  Yes, but I don't know.  You think the girls out there like that crap? 
[02:30:00]  The ones I've talked to, they don't like the muscle heads like that.  No, not like that.  So who's he doing it for?  I think it's a special weirdo kind of girl that likes that shit.  I think he's doing it for himself and other guys.  It's good to be in shape.  Yeah, but when you're getting that big, you're doing it for yourself and other guys.  It's an obsession, I think, unless you're competing.  And even then, it's an obsession with the whole competition.  But, yeah.  I want to go on record and say one thing.  Yes. 
[02:30:30]  We've been doing this radio show for a very long time.  Patrice brought the loudest meal ever.  Did you?  To our show.  I didn't even notice.  Between the potato chips.  I'm sorry.  That's just disgusting.  Were your potato chips individually wrapped in plastic baggies?  What, did he get gravel bites and fucking?  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  I was trying so hard.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[02:31:00]  It's okay, Patrice.  This guy continues.  This is huge.  I know we did it already, but it's worth playing again.  Yeah.  Just look at this muscle, man.  Oh, God.  Oh, fucked out.  This is XM.  We got the, thank you, fan.  We got the unedited version of this.  Oh, what's he saying?  That's the real reason why we want to replay this today.  Yeah, look at these muscles, man.  Yep.  Fucking 285 pounds of muscle. 
[02:31:30]  Just look at me, man.  Have you ever seen this much muscle, man?  56-inch pecs, man.  20-inch biceps.  20-inch net.  Look at these traps, man.  This is one massive, man.  Good.  Look at these huge nipples, man.  Huge nipples?  Yeah.  Just look at this muscle, man. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, God.  It's so beautiful.  This motherfucker's doing nipple exercises.  Oh, God.  It'd be so fucking big.  Nipple-ups.  Nipple-ups.  Mm.  Oh, my earlobes.  Can you believe it?  Oh, I just fucking...  Oh, God.  I can get all for myself just looking at this body, man.  Mm.  Someone wants...  Looking at his man's body.  Someone wants me to point out, I did not see this video.  I saw, like, the still shot and maybe five seconds of it.  Yeah.  But someone is saying that I should point out that he actually tweaks his fucking nipples.  I swear to God, I did not see that, but I guess he's doing that in the video, too. 
[02:32:30]  He's really into himself.  All right.  I got it.  He's into guys.  I got it.  Yeah.  Somebody has to step up for this show, and it's got to be either Travis or Sam.  And they have to reenact this video, and we have to get it to break immediately.  Ew.  And you will have hundreds of thousands of views.  Oh, wow.  You mean, like, just take the shirt off and go, oh, look at this body.  Dude, yeah.  Oh, look.  Recite it word for word?  Word for word.  Oh, look at these nipples. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, because these guys are, like, built like veals.  Danny, you want to do it?  Well, not really, like veals.  Danny would do it.  But Danny would do it.  Holocaust survivors.  No, Danny's got too much meat on him.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Like, I don't.  It's funny if it's skinny.  I don't mind doing it at all.  It's a really skinny guy.  Yeah, I think it would be funnier if it was.  Who would do it?  Travis said he would.  Travis would do it?  Yeah.  But you guys got to do it exactly like this guy.  Travis, would you do this?  I'm telling you, this will fly on the internet big time.  No, I definitely don't want to do this. 
[02:33:30]  You'd have to be topless.  You'd have to be looking at the camera going, ugh.  Look at these muscles.  Travis has had a longstanding policy of not showing nipple.  Yeah, I don't show nipple.  Oh, wow.  You got three.  Big reveal.  You got three nips?  No, no.  Sam, come on, man.  You want a little fame in your life?  Not this kind of fame.  Well, who are you going to get?  Adam?  Adam will do it.  Adam will do it in a second.  Come here, Adam.  He's a creep.  Again, not skinny enough. 
[02:34:00]  Well, let's see.  It's got to be really the opposite of...  All right, all the guys take their shirts off.  It's either got to be somebody really fat or really skinny.  All right, let's see.  We could get Tony to do it.  Why are they...  Don't get people...  All right, everyone take their shirts off.  What are you doing?  This is so geek.  No, we need really skinny, dude.  I'm not skinny.  Sam, it's either you or Travis.  Come on.  You guys...  Travis is 120 pounds.  Yeah, Travis is skinnier than me. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, see, these guys...  I mean, on camera, they're going to, you know...  I'm knee-deep in this Afro War weight gain.  What?  I guess the...  Oh, you don't want to be distracted?  No, I don't.  Why don't we weigh me and Travis to see who's skinnier?  Well, I think we know it.  And whoever weighs less...  Now the guys are...  Now these two guys are standing around with their shirts off.  You can put your shirts back on.  Indeed.  We weren't impressed by your skinniness.  We need someone that's really skinny to react this video.  I'm telling you, it'll be huge.  People saying it never takes... 
[02:35:00]  Never takes long on the XM side to go gay as fuck.  Yeah, you're right.  It's a great idea, though.  I guarantee from the neck down, Sam is black as all fuck.  He's probably had a bleach peel like Michael Jackson.  He doesn't want anybody to see his true identity.  Yeah, I think you're right about this, though.  If it's a skinny person...  Shit.  It would be really funny.  It really is a good idea.  What do you guys got to step up?  Come on.  Travis is skinnier.  Travis, why wouldn't you do it? 
[02:35:30]  Is Travis skinnier than you?  Yeah, he is.  Travis is 118 pounds?  Hopefully more by now.  I don't know.  We'll see on Friday.  Yeah, we're going to do the weigh-in on Friday for biggest gainer.  One way to find out.  We have no takers?  I got like 10 pounds on Travis.  It really wouldn't work if I did it.  But Travis, this would be big.  It would work.  But we need an actor, too, because you really got to sell the...  Come on.  What are you skinny motherfuckers?  You got to sell it like, ugh.  Ugh, look at these nipples. 
[02:36:00]  Casting call.  Ugh.  We need a skinny motherfucker.  All right, cast and call.  Open casting call.  But we got to get it done immediately.  I know.  So if you're in the air and you're a skinny fuck, like Flea would be perfect, but his acting  would suck.  We need someone that can really act.  Force Sam to strip.  Ugh.  Make him.  Tell him to do a wrestling pose while he's doing it.  He'll do it.  Oh, yeah.  You want to be like one of your heroes?  All right, get it out of here. 
[02:36:30]  I'll think about it.  Oh, don't think about it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Sam, we'll stop instigating.  We'll promote one of your dog's videos in return.  Oh, God.  Put his dog videos up on YouTube.  Adorable.  All right.  We'll move on to the real State of the Union.  What if it's done on a closed set?  Yeah, I don't...  Just Sam as the cameraman, you in a closed room, and you run through the whole thing. 
[02:37:00]  I don't even have to be there.  We could set the camera up, and then Travis could just do it without anybody there.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think I have a problem with a closed set if it's going to be on the internet.  Well, some people have a problem with the live aspect of it.  That wouldn't bother me.  Is Dave a topless?  Is he a mess when he's topless?  Eastside?  Oh, yeah.  Especially some of his tattoos.  Yeah.  Horrible tats.  Or Pat from Wynaki. 
[02:37:30]  That would be funny.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we could go that way.  Pat would do...  Look at these pecs.  Look at this muscle.  Look at these nipples.  Tweak.  Would Pat do it, and is he close to the station?  What about Big A?  Oh, man.  Big A might be good.  Look at these pecs.  I still say it's a good idea. 
[02:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Sam or Travis better step up.  They're not going to step up.  All right.  We'll figure it out, hopefully.  I bet when they first came in here, and were hungry for a job, they'd be fighting each  other over who got to do this.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's like, nah, nah.  I'm comfortable.  I bet you they have those, like, what's the name for it?  Port wine stains.  I bet you they have port wine stains under their shirts.  You think that's it? 
[02:38:30]  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  Like, Gorbachev's head.  Just port wine stains.  In the shape of Africa.  You know what?  Here's even a better contest.  Let's just take bets on who has the most atrocious disfigurement or something.  Something that's the most...  I guarantee Sam has something wrong.  You think something's going on?  A weird hair on his back. 
[02:39:00]  Some weird long hair that he can't pluck or to cause cancer.  Travis has a sexy wife that loves him.  I have a funny feeling Travis just has an average, like, you know, nothing wrong body.  Yeah.  Hey, we got it.  Roland.  Thank you for the suggestion.  Dan C. from Pottstown, PA.  Roland isn't shy.  He'll do it.  Is he in the area?  We'll get him on the phone immediately.  All right.  Get him on the phone.  Where's Roland?  Has anyone seen him?  Is he on campus?  A lot of people now calling up and saying Roland. 
[02:39:30]  Mr. Hand.  Bob Kelly would be good.  Is Bob Kelly in the area?  Nah.  No?  Nah.  Nah.  Bob has a regular, um, fat body.  Nah.  All right.  Let's, uh, do some more highlights from the State of the Union last night.  Uh, Bush, uh, says we're doing well against Al Qaeda.  When we met last year, Al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq.  And their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country.  Today, it is Al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held.  And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including  hundreds of key Al Qaeda leaders and operatives.  Oh, yeah.  Tell that to the, uh, soldiers that were killed yesterday.  Yeah.  When they, they, they were ambushed and then shot at from a fucking mosque and, and mowed  down from a fucking mosque.  Why does that mosque still stand? 
[02:40:30]  And why wasn't it just fucking pulverized?  Riddle me that, dummy.  You're calling the president a dummy.  He is a dummy.  That's not good.  He's a fucking dummy.  I thought you liked him.  There was a time you liked him, wasn't there?  Yeah, there was.  There was, right?  Right, uh, right.  The whole time, kind of before 9-11.  A little after.  And then a little after.  When he was standing down there at ground zero with his megaphone, we were still-  Now, that kind of started making me feel a little weird. 
[02:41:00]  A little weird about him during the megaphone thing.  But before he was elected, I, I was like, all right, this is the guy.  I said, this is the guy that's going to be the next president.  So, like, a year before he was elected.  Uh, just because of his stand on, uh, crime and, um, his, the way he would electrocute people  down there in Texas was really good.  And people liked it.  He used bleachers.  Electric bleachers.  Because he killed so many people.  You know, and then- 
[02:41:30]  You don't think B.O. would do better than, uh, Bush?  Uh, in a different way, probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're talking two different things.  It's like what I said before.  It's like, you know, the president of Botswana.  Is he doing better for his country than George Bush is for this country?  You can't compare the two.  Would you stop comparing, um-  Okay, then I'll say Indonesia.  Would you stop comparing fucking dictators like General Butt Naked to, like, Barack Obama?  General Butt Naked. 
[02:42:00]  General Butt Naked.  You didn't hear General Butt Naked?  No.  What's that?  You never heard of General Butt Naked?  No.  What is it, guy?  He's the butt-  He's the fucking army guy that used to get his guys to strip butt naked with just boots  and, uh, and guns and go fight.  General Butt Naked.  Why?  Why?  It scared the shit out of people, man.  It was scared of the foot, thank you, man.  You see a nigga's dick swinging with a pistol, coming to kill your fucking-  Coming out to you with a machete to hack you apart.  Yeah, coming to fucking burn your fucking farm, man. 
[02:42:30]  You don't want end-of-life guy to be naked.  Oh, yeah.  See?  That's why it would scare people.  I love the Patrice concept from earlier today.  End-of-life guy.  You don't want him naked.  The end of your life.  I mean, that was something about that, um, no country for old men.  Yeah.  And I'm just sitting there, I think it was me and Gab were sitting there watching it,  and we were just looking at it and going, you know, this is the end-of-your-life guy.  This guy, that old man's like, hey, so where you coming from?  You know, and the guy's like, what do you mean where I'm from?  Yeah.  And I was like, oh my God, no, no, Jesus, no. 
[02:43:00]  This is the end-of-my-fucking-life.  And not for anything I did, but just to say, hey, how's it going, buddy?  How's it going?  How's what going?  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no.  You know what I played the end-of-your-life guy in a lot of movies?  This was Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci was the end-of-your-life guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was just like, what happened?  I'm sorry, what?  Oh, no, no, no.  What the fuck did you?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, no.  Oh, no, not the end-of-your-life guy.  I didn't mean it like that.  You took it the wrong way.  I had a gun question for you, too, when we get a chance to throw that in there. 
[02:43:30]  Go ahead, throw it in.  Love it.  It's a pop culture gun question.  Ooh.  Your favorite movie gun of all time.  Literally, in a movie, your favorite movie gun.  Wow, that's a good one.  And not general, but like the gun from this is my favorite movie gun.  Yeah, off the top of my head, without really thinking about it much, that friggin' helicopter 
[02:44:00]  machine gun from fucking Predator.  Oh, the, okay, all right.  Yeah, that's a classic.  That was pretty good.  I mean, that ripped shit apart.  That was pretty good.  I would argue with that, yeah.  I was just curious.  Good movie gun.  Because you're a gun guy.  Yeah, that's a good movie gun.  Mine is Desert Eagle.  Desert Eagle's always good.  Desert Eagle.  Oh, there's a great clip on YouTube of a little skinny girl shooting at Desert Eagle,  and the kick puts the thing square across the bridge of a nose and a forehead. 
[02:44:30]  Bam!  Oh, wow.  Did it knock her out?  No, she stood up, but they kind of cut really quick.  I guess the people with the camera were a little concerned, but man, you get hit in the face  with that motherfucker.  They're heavy guns, too.  That is, there's no fucking reason to have that gun, aside from the fact that-  You have a Desert Eagle?  You want it?  I will be getting one. 
[02:45:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Once I-  You're planning on getting one?  Yeah.  I have to do a few things.  What?  Some paperwork's got to get in order.  You can have one, all right?  Yeah, yeah.  There's, that's pretty much a, I got a small dick.  There's the girl that gets bopped?  Yeah, here she is.  It's on break.  Look at this.  What's the search on break for the people out there?  Desert Eagle.  Okay.  She's ready to shoot it.  Yeah.  She's really thin. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Right in the middle of the forehead.  Yeah, it just cracks her.  Oh!  Wow!  Wait, the front of the gun pops backwards.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  She's lucky another shot didn't come out.  Yeah, she could have died, right?  She could have shot herself in the head.  Hey, it's coming out.  Oh, is that fantastic?  The Rose McGowan gun in Planetura.  The leg.  Yeah, you like that one?  The leg.  That was a little weird.  I wouldn't say that.  I'm looking for more. 
[02:46:00]  Real.  That's just weird.  That was Chrisco.  Like a real, the real guns.  Like a real gun that, you know, just in the movie.  How about RoboCop's gun?  That's not real.  That is a fucking great gun, dude.  That's pretty cool.  Like that shit that comes out of his leg.  It's the machine pistol.  Yeah.  Great fucking gun.  That is a, that might be a top.  Yeah, that's a good movie gun.  That's a top gun, man.  That's cool.  That's coming in.  That's a top gun.  Scott from New York has one.  Scott?  Hey, boys.  How about, hey, Anthony, you know that movie Runaway with Gene Simmons? 
[02:46:30]  Remember that guy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, with the little missile that came out of the gun.  Oh, right.  All right.  So if you're going to get magical guns, fucking Judge Dredd's gun.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  The one that he talks to, that he makes, you know, grenade or, well, I was thinking more  regular guns you can get your hands on.  Yeah, real kind of guns.  There's a lot of great fucking magical guns.  I mean, Terminator, when you first see Terminator, that's the first movie to ever have the laser 
[02:47:00]  scope.  Yeah, yeah.  And the laser scope made the gun look better than it really was.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And he put that thing right on the head.  For, oh, man.  I know I'm jerking that movie off, but he had a fucking sawed off 12 gauge pump shotgun  with a silencer on it.  Yeah, that thing was sick.  A pump shotgun with a silencer on it.  That thing was twisted. 
[02:47:30]  Well, then you got the other thing he was using.  I don't even know what the fuck you call it.  It's to kill cows, but he was knocking the locks off out of doors.  Yeah.  And, well, he used it on occasion.  And then a couple people.  Popped someone's head open with it.  I was pretty fucked up.  I would also say there's a few guns from Commando that are spectacular.  Yeah.  He has a couple of really good guns in Commando.  I'm sure Arnold Schwarzenegger probably pound for pound.  Sam Jackson has a good gun in Pulp Fiction. 
[02:48:00]  Pulp Fiction, yeah.  He has a great gun.  Made Ringo's look like a little piece of shit when he grabbed it.  And put that big fucking gun in his face.  Great gun in that movie.  Yeah.  I personally.  That was a cool one, too, that John Travolta had that he left on the counter.  That little machine pistol Uzi with the big silencer on it.  Butcher just brought up Desperado.  The wrist, the spring-loaded one. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, right, right.  Desperado.  Yeah.  Well, that's also.  Oh, right, right.  Taxi driver.  He had that whole thing where he had it on the little rails that came out into his hand.  But they were just regular guns.  How about the first time you ever saw the .357?  Or the one, the Clint Eastwood.  Dirty Harry.  Dirty Harry stuff.  Yeah.  The first time you saw that one.  Dirty Harry in the last movie had a great gun.  That was a .357 when they shot his dog Meathead.  And he was standing there and the gun was almost at his feet when he had it down. 
[02:49:00]  It was the longest barrel gun you've ever seen.  Yeah, that big barrel.  Let's go to Jason in Oregon.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, one of the best guns ever in a movie has to be out of Jackal, man.  Oh, shit, man.  I don't know.  Yeah, the Jack.  That wasn't the one with Bruce Willis, was it?  Yeah, Bruce Willis.  That was a great fucking gun.  It was a .50.  Damn, I don't remember that one.  It was like a .50.  Watch it out. 
[02:49:30]  It was a .50.  Oh, and this is the gun I dream about killing people with.  I do a lot of dreaming about killing.  I don't, like, but, like, very, uh, my killing is very, uh, uh, what's the word?  It's, it's, what's the word I'm looking for, man?  It's, it's not a bullshit just murdering anybody.  It's, like, very quality killing.  Calculated and.  Very, like, I don't want to say anything to get me in trouble.  Very, like, necessary, you die, you die, you die.  Like, like, very Jesus-y, very coming back.  Very, you're helping the world. 
[02:50:00]  Yes, very coming back.  I dream about being on the news, making a, a announcement of who's going to die.  No one can stop me.  Um, who's going to die and in what order, and there's nothing you can do about it.  I'm going to get people that deserve to die, and, and, and starting with this guy.  And I say it on the news, no one can stop me, and the gun that this guy's talking about  is the gun I use to kill people.  It's a remote-controlled, um, super gun where you sit and you, it has a camera.  You can sit about, you know, you could be a mile away, and you sit in your car, and it's 
[02:50:30]  almost video game type.  You, you put it in a van, and you just, uh, you, you kill people with a gun, or put it  in a building, and you remote control the, the, the, the killing.  And I, and I, and I dream about, you know, end of your life guy, but on a higher level,  like.  Dude, that would be a great movie right there.  Uh.  It's pretty cool.  Serial killer with, like, a freaking remote-controlled gun.  Remote-controlled gun.  It's, it's, it's been a couple of, you know, that movie Shooter with, um. 
[02:51:00]  It was like that?  Yeah, you had a remote-controlled gun, you know, you could just, you just.  Right.  With a little pin, and, and, you know, you just, I don't know, I, I don't know, man.  End of your life, guys, is a very attractive thing to me.  I don't know why.  Just because some people, you know, there was this, this cunt at, uh, the, the DMV that  just, you know, you, you know, not that you want to kill her.  She should, and, you know, her family should cry, but just, you know, kill you, and then  bring you back to life to say, do you see. 
[02:51:30]  And say, see that.  The options.  How quickly that could have happened.  Like, for you to just arbitrarily be a cunt to me.  Because I find, you know, I have less of a problem with dudes in public, in service position.  Dudes don't act, you know, when you're on the phone, it seems like dudes are more helpful  on the phone when you're dealing with cable, you're dealing with the telephone company.  It just seems like women are just miserable, just a miserable, uh, creature.  And, and, and, and not to get into that, but it's like, sometimes you just want to, you 
[02:52:00]  just want to kill them all day.  You know, and just to, just to say there's an option out there, just to, just to do something  fucked up.  Now, I want to say certain people, uh, jobs, which you can get in trouble for even fucking  announcing that.  So it's like, I would just love to, just to, just to say I did it.  Let's go to Crotch Critter.  Or he's got Anthony's gun.  That's the Osama Bin Laden.  That would be a fun thing.  Wouldn't you like to just say, the doctor tells you, uh, you got a year to live. 
[02:52:30]  Uh, you, you'll be healthy up until you die, but you got a year to live.  Who wouldn't want to just pack up, go to Afghanistan and just give it a whirl?  Take a shot.  Take a shot.  Just take a shot at it.  What about this?  What about walkers?  That's your, that's your, that's your bucket list.  That's my bucket list right there.  If I'm told, I'm taking, I'm, I'm grabbing every penny out of the bank.  I'm, I'm fucking chartering a plane.  Drop me somewhere.  Would you kill him if you knew you was going to die? 
[02:53:00]  If I knew, if you knew you was going to die in, in a, in a, in an attempt to kill him.  In an attempt to kill him.  Would you go and kill him?  I guess.  Even if you knew you was going to get shot.  I think the adrenaline would take over.  If I was, you would do that.  If, if you're at the point where you're there and, and ready to kill him, I guess you're  not going to go like, yeah, like you mean he's, he's got people around him.  There's going to be no getting away from it, but you got the shot.  You are going to die.  You blow his head off and you, the only way to kill him is to get, that you have to die  too. 
[02:53:30]  You have a, um, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  One second.  Let's not like what I'm thinking of.  It made me think of a gun in the line of fire, a fucking wooden gun that he made with just  two bullets.  Oh, that thing.  Yeah.  That little carved a gun.  Yeah.  That, uh, what's his name?  Uh, John, Michael, John Malkovich.  Uh, now you have that gun.  What the hell?  The memory, by the way.  You, you have that gun walking up on Saddam, uh, uh, Osama bin Laden. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Bin Laden.  You walk up on him.  You got two bullets.  You got to get this close to him, bust him in the head.  And after you're done, you go, well, I'm out of, you know, no more bullets.  And you're waiting to get fucking, you're waiting to get not only shot, but probably  really fucked up by the arrows.  See, here it is.  A real ass fucking.  That's what I mean.  Now, if you were just going to die in a blaze of frigging gunfire, that's one thing.  If you off Osama bin Laden, then you got to fucking wait while they saw your fucking 
[02:54:30]  head off.  Dad, you go.  How are you going to do that?  No.  Ain't happening.  Ain't happening.  I am not getting my head sawn off.  How about this?  So, you know, a soldier out there that might end up killing Osama bin Laden, right?  When he comes back to America, does he ever get a traffic ticket again?  If they know who it is?  Yeah, if they ever know.  How far can he go?  I don't think they would tell anybody.  When he comes back to America? 
[02:55:00]  I'm just saying, this is all dumb talk.  He would have to market it.  I'd be like, dude, yeah, no, don't pay.  Would you ever pay for another meal?  Don't pay taxes.  Don't pay for anything.  You know what?  That's the same token as saying the guys that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.  I don't think his life would change for two seconds.  But, you know, I think he'll be just a regular dude.  You saw Fog of War, right?  Yeah.  Where one of these guys, he was like, he was this shit back in the day.  And they show him stuck in traffic in Washington. 
[02:55:30]  I'm like, man, I'm thinking if you were this shit back in the day that you would never have  to worry about any of that crap ever again.  He's in the rain.  He's in traffic.  He's one of the most powerful guys in the world.  He was at the time.  And now he's just a regular dude, like stuck in traffic.  Old guy in traffic.  Like we are.  And that just was interesting to me.  I'm just I'm still hung up on this whole Osama bin Laden thing.  Like it would have to be a wooden pistol, one bullet next to him and you fucking have 
[02:56:00]  nothing else.  You got close to him.  They checked you a couple of times.  And what happened is they left you.  They checked you before.  It was like 10 of them checking you.  Because you remember in the line of fire, he had the bullets in a rabbit's foot.  Right.  He had the other thing.  And he was able to put it all together.  So you get in, you got a camera.  They checked that.  You have like something on your hat.  The feather is like a bullet.  Yeah.  Fucking your keys are like, you know, whatever.  And you can make a little gun with one bullet in it. 
[02:56:30]  You're an interviewer.  He got one fucking goofy guy.  You interview him for about 45 minutes.  They're comfortable with you.  You take out that wooden pistol and then blowie.  And now you're just chilling like, and now what?  You can't save one for yourself?  Like, bam, bam.  No suicide plans.  Damn it.  Damn it.  That's rough because they are going to fuck you up.  You're not going to just die.  See, that's it.  It's like, oh, would you die to take him out? 
[02:57:00]  Under a certain circumstance, sure.  But you're talking about would you go through unimaginable pain and then a horrific death before, you know, you die after killing him?  I don't think I'd be ready to have my head sewn off.  Here's another.  Hmm.  Ethical catch.  Uh-huh.  Ready?  Yeah.  You.  This is not on TV.  So basically, they're never going to tell the world that you fucking killed Osama. 
[02:57:30]  And they're going to cut your fucking head off unceremoniously.  So now you're just a piece of, you're a body dumped in the river.  Oh.  And no one might, because we already think that motherfucker's already dead.  And no one knows he's even dead.  So you.  It just goes like, you know you killed him.  You know you killed him.  But you're dead.  So.  You're the only one.  They burn his body.  Yes.  So no one knows like that he ever was killed.  Like the Hitler death.  He'll just always be a mystery.  People still think he's alive in his little bunker like walking around. 
[02:58:00]  That's not unreasonable to think.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good, because then that brings the whole sin of vanity and pride into the  whole thing.  That's that's a tough question, because you would want some kind of recognition, especially  if you're going to pay the supreme sacrifice for it. 
[02:58:30]  No, I say no.  I want to.  I want people to fucking know at least that he's dead.  Maybe some, you know, for them to go, someone did it.  So you have some posthumous fucking accolade.  It wouldn't even have to be recognition that I did it, but there would have to be confirmation  that he did get killed.  I got one.  That somebody got through and killed him.  I got one.  I got one.  All right.  So you you killed bin Laden.  But at the last second, they say they're going to spare your life and you don't die for 
[02:59:00]  killing bin Laden.  But for the rest of your life, you can't tell.  No, everyone knows.  But for the rest of your life, you have to suck cock.  Jesus Christ.  What?  You can't.  I get the killed bin Laden if I can suck dick.  But now I have to suck dick.  And it's the only way I get to live.  Would you take that?  You have to.  That sounds like something the Muslims would come up with over there.  Yeah, sure.  Exactly.  Jesus, that turn heroically gay. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  Oh, but why did it have to go heroically gay?  Just to, you know, throw a little curveball.  He's a war hero.  He's a war hero.  But fucking guy right there.  You see him?  He's a cocksucker.  Yeah, dude.  He killed fucking bin Laden.  He has to now do that.  So just give him a pass.  That gay guy.  Wait a minute, though.  Okay, you're heterosexual, but now you have that gay guy that killed bin Laden.  Yeah.  I don't even know if that's bad, but it's bad for your, again, your own pride. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  But it's set up in such a way, if you don't suck the cock, you die instantly.  Oh, you have to suck a dick there.  No, just all the time now.  How are they going to know?  Yeah, what are they going to know?  Once you get back to the U.S. and you go, ah.  No, no, no, no.  I'll suck the dick to get out of that beheading.  I mean, when you get back to the States.  My promise?  Suck my dick.  Any guy out there is sucking a dick to keep from getting his head sawn off.  You know how many Arabs is getting their fucking balls licked to get me out of that beheading? 
[03:00:30]  And then I get home, and I go, I killed bin Laden.  How'd you get away?  Had to suck 65 insurgent's dicks.  It's nothing worse than insurgent balls.  Right.  On your nose.  It was a circle jerk over me with insurgent balls.  And the second someone looks at you sideways, you play a video of someone getting their  head cut off and go, look, look.  That's the option.  That was the option, motherfucker.  I wouldn't do that.  Nope.  I'd have fucking gone down like a man. 
[03:01:00]  Fucking have my...  Yeah, would you?  I'm doing rusty trombones all up and down Afghanistan, coastline.  Till I get home.  All the way to the border.  And I'm like, you know, you tell your girl a man's got to do what a man's got to do, bitch.  That's a congo line.  All the way to the...  Another dick.  Just a bunch of fucking insurgents calling you my friend.  I just had to kind of...  My friend, my friend, my friend.  Mow it up. 
[03:01:30]  Oh my God.  It's like when you get home, you still have to suck dick.  Like, fuck that.  Like, you're going against your word, my friend.  Eat my ass.  I'm saying, like, there's an Al-Qaeda ghost that just follows you around constantly.  Operative.  And he kills you if you don't continue.  Kill fucking Bin Laden.  I'll kill him too.  No, no.  No.  Oh, like, mine is far-fetched, but some of the shit you came up with isn't.  It's not as far-fetched.  As an Al-Qaeda guy making sure you're only sucking dick. 
[03:02:00]  What is a...  What did I say that was far-fetcher?  The fucking dick sucking.  Al-Qaeda ghost?  You break...  You promise to suck dick.  With an Al-Qaeda ghost looking over you.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Get the fuck out of here.  My built...  My fucking built gun to kill Bin Laden.  Yeah.  That's far-fetched.  My fucking wooden gun that I carved to kill Bin Laden. 
[03:02:30]  More State of the Union.  The president from last night.  Another taste.  Last month, Osama Bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders  who have turned on Al-Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq.  Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists, there is no doubt.  Al-Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. 
[03:03:00]  They sure stopped clapping abruptly.  American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces,  and eventually to a protective overwatch mission.  As part of this transition, one Army Brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home  and will not be replaced.  One soldier.  In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. 
[03:03:30]  Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.  Iraq.  Alright, so 20,000 guys are coming home?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When are the Iraqis going to take over their own country?  I was reading that they admitted that they're not going to be able to until we want, by the end of the year, I believe,  and they're saying over there somewhere between 2010 and 2012, they feel they'll be ready. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah?  That's what they're saying over there.  How come all the time that we were going to attack them, they were all ready?  They were going to kick our ass.  How come now they can't be trained?  They're all corrupt.  The police department's selling our guys out.  Dude, it's the wild, wild west.  It's just a mess.  The whole area is the wild, wild west.  They've got to figure it out.  It's going to take a long time.  Can I get some white help from this?  Yes, Patrice.  Why the fuck... 
[03:04:30]  Okay, we know the underlying belief that it's about other things, but let's say this was all genuine, this whole thing.  Why are we...  Why would that eventually affect us if we disminded our fucking business?  Oh, if we...  If we just didn't involve ourselves in these shitty problems.  If we never did anything with Iraq?  If we just left fuckers alone, because why eventually would that fuck with us? 
[03:05:00]  Well, then they would have, as Saddam was saying, annexed Kuwait.  And then Saudi Arabia was also on his hit list.  Okay.  There wouldn't have been a first Gulf War, so he still would have had a pretty strong army.  And he was kind of a nut.  You know, it was proven that he would go into other countries and take whatever he wanted.  Okay.  So if we didn't get involved, I guess he'd be free to just do that.  And remember supergroups?  And if he did that.  If he did that.  And if he did that, it would destabilize the area that we depend on for oil. 
[03:05:30]  Which is already, you know, not that stable anyway.  Which is all...  It ends up being all about oil again.  Yeah, it is.  The only reason we give a shit about the Middle East is because of oil.  I've never heard anybody ever say that, though.  I've never heard a fucking president ever say that.  But you know what it is?  You hear people say it, but they put it in this context of you just see some stupid college douche saying,  it's about the oil, man.  And they try to say it's about the oil as far as money goes. 
[03:06:00]  And people in these oil companies making money.  No, it has to do with we need that shit to run our shit.  So we need that area to be as stable as it possibly can be.  And that's the only reason we're there.  There are destabilized nations all over the world.  Why the fuck aren't we there?  Why aren't we in a lot of these countries in Africa that are just upside down with people chopping each other up with machetes?  We don't care about the people, their freedoms.  If there's an asset that we need as a country to survive, then we're going to fight to keep it stable. 
[03:06:30]  That's not a wrong thing either.  Why the fuck should we give up oil that runs everywhere?  You like the lights?  You like fucking driving?  You like stuff like that?  Then we got to shoot some people.  It's just the way the world works right now.  Maybe in the future it'll be different.  You like lights, motherfucker?  That's what it is.  Remember supergroups?  Supergroups.  Yeah, you don't want them to become a super country.  A super country.  Right, right.  You don't want any one super country over there in the Middle East to destabilize everything. 
[03:07:00]  Where they all get together and become one big super country.  That's why having Israel there is a fucking monkey wrench in the whole works.  Because it kind of gives democracies excuses to say, hey, what the fuck are you doing?  To a lot of these Arab countries.  It's like, come on, it's Israel.  They're just trying to live free.  I don't know if that many Americans really, except for Jewish people, but I don't think a lot of Americans really care about Israel as an ally or a sovereign nation as they do with keeping some kind of a foothold and stability and American ally over there in the Middle East. 
[03:07:30]  Or else we're fucked.  Over oil.  Over the fucking oil.  Yeah, that's all.  It's the shit in the ground.  You'd think if that oil wasn't on the ground, why would we want a fucking sandy, dusty place with people that don't know how to wipe their asses and houses that look like the Flintstones house? 
[03:08:00]  Why would we ever want to defend that, go there, fight for them, do anything?  The oil is very important to our economy.  We need oil.  This country runs on it.  Texas and Venezuela.  Not enough.  People at Venezuela.  I think we should invade Venezuela.  They have a shitload of oil.  And Venezuela's giving oil away in some places.  In Russia they do, but Russia's fucking, they are, they're giving oil away, except for us, to us.  They hate us. 
[03:08:30]  They hate us.  But, you know something?  Maybe if we wanted to go down there, start some shit, maybe we could make it look like they started some shit, and then we could fuck them up.  And really, not like the Middle East, just legitimately take their oil.  Set up a pipeline and just ship it up here.  I think as much shit that's happened, I mean, I think as much shit has happened, I think if we did something like that, it would be forgotten and forgiven in a few years.  If we just went in, took Venezuela's oil, left, said nothing else, the world was upset and everybody was going. 
[03:09:00]  Oh yeah, there'd be condemnation in the UN.  Don't go to Venezuela, it's very dangerous for Americans to go to Venezuela.  And just hang out for a minute, no wars, no bullshit.  They'll forget it, and it'll be fine.  And then we'd have cheap oil.  Let's go to Jason Clifton with the Arabs.  Jason?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Good morning.  What's up?  My main argument is, being that we are in the East for the oil, don't you think more or less the fact we're spending more money on going out, fighting for war, fighting for the oil that's out there, 
[03:09:30]  as opposed to spending more money and more resources into looking for outside ways to get this country running?  We don't have any alternative or outside ways.  Right now, we are based in fucking oil.  I'd say this, the day the oil ran out, when we turn on the oil faucet in this country and nothing comes out, you will see a super genius, the next week, invent something that works just like oil. 
[03:10:00]  I'm trying to, why can't we run just things like seawater?  Because we don't have to, because there's oil.  Everything's piped for oil.  Everything's made for, all the cars out there are made for petroleum-based machines.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, go with that thought, though.  Anthony's right, but you can't just, you can't go from a country that depends on oil to a country that depends on sunflower seeds. 
[03:10:30]  We went, no, seriously, if you read about this stuff on any level, if you do that drastically, the entire economy will collapse.  No matter what you decide you need to do, it has to be a slow fade-in.  Complete industries would be destroyed, which would completely destroy our economy.  That's why we don't go right to electric cars or right to fucking peanut butter in your gas tanks, whatever the fuck it's going to be. 
[03:11:00]  Whatever they're doing, taking oil from french fries and putting it in a motor.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, it's got to be a slow, why, why can't we just, we went from eight tracks to cassettes overnight, and cassettes to see, I'm not even trying to module.  Yeah, but I don't think the, uh.  But the shock of that, because I was an anti-CD guy, now you don't exist, you don't see cassettes and things like that.  As a matter of fact, even saying CDs, you know, you're dating yourself.  The world wasn't, you know, the United States especially, it wasn't based on cassette tapes. 
[03:11:30]  Because of iPods and all that shit, right?  Yeah, but I mean, I look at my CDs, I was unpacking boxes the other day, I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do with these things?  Yeah, you're right, you're fucking right.  But, okay, but what about the, what I'm saying is, why can't we just go fuck that?  Look, oil, we're killing everybody for oil, this shit is fucking the earth up, do you know?  They are, let's just make peanut butter run engines.  They are, they are, but they're not, it's, but they can't just switch over to that overnight.  Why?  It would destroy the economy, I'm not. 
[03:12:00]  Why?  Everything.  I know you're not, but why?  Do you know what it would take, okay, okay, could you see having every major, major, every  single automotive company have to retool everything to now run on the peanut butter?  Yes.  No.  You wouldn't have to fire anybody.  It would cost a fortune.  Of course you would have to fire people.  Where's this front money coming from?  Let's say, let's say Michigan, all right, you got the car thing happening in Detroit and  Michigan and all that, right?  Let's make believe Sacramento becomes the peanut butter running, you know, car running. 
[03:12:30]  I love that it's peanut butter now.  It's just peanut butter.  And it stays peanut butter.  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  Also, now you are completely shutting down Michigan.  Completely.  Yeah.  Detroit is just.  Now it's completely has to be like just fenced in and gone.  The economy would completely collapse in that area.  But wouldn't that area, wouldn't the car people or whoever had to make things to run  on peanut butter, right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't they just say, okay, everybody, we're starting to make this turn into peanut butter 
[03:13:00]  and they keep their jobs and you just teach them how to fucking make peanut butter?  That's what we're doing about every house that runs on oil heat now has to have furnaces  that run on peanut butter.  All right, fair enough.  Now you got to set up peanut butter delivery companies.  Fair enough, fair enough.  Yeah, deliver that they come with the big peanut butter truck.  Oh my God.  Yeah, that's true.  So, so how, how much, how much, how long does it take, would it take to transition us out  of oil?  That's what we're doing slowly, but I don't think we're going to see it in our lifetime. 
[03:13:30]  They're going until it gets too out of control where they're doing it slowly, but surely  with the electric cars and all that and trying to figure that shit out.  But we got like hybrid hydrogen vehicles now and you can't do it overnight though.  The economy would collapse.  We would need an expert in here to completely explain this point.  They're not doing, they're not like, they're not being stubborn about the whole thing.  It's about the almighty dollar and they know that would just be horrible for our economy.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  It's a, yeah, it's a weird transitional, a transitional period right now where, um, oil  isn't scarce enough yet and it, the price isn't high enough yet.  Uh, it's still available.  It was 99 cents a year ago, two years ago, maybe 99, some of the oil, I mean, gas was  99 cents.  Well, it was, you know, in the thirties per barrel, not long ago at all.  And then it shot up to just about a hundred dollars a barrel in a very short period of 
[03:14:30]  time.  But they say that it's still on par with seventies gas prices.  If they gave you an Escalade, right?  Said, said Anthony, we got this peanut butter Escalade.  Yeah.  And all you got to do is fill it with three, you can drive a hundred miles on three, um,  16 ounce, um, jars of Jiffy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you got the, you got the test model.  Would you, would you drive around in a peanut butter? 
[03:15:00]  In a peanut butter mobile?  Yeah.  Does it, does it, does it have the pickup that mine has?  It, okay, let's figure out what, okay, a peanut butter car would probably not.  Got navigation?  Because it doesn't have the exhaust, you probably have to pull over, okay, you have  to pull over every 15 miles to let the peanut butter re-cook.  Every 15 miles?  Take your fucking peanut butter Escalade and shove it up your ass, because I ain't driving  every 15 miles, you got to let it re-peanut butter. 
[03:15:30]  You just have to plan your peanut butter drive.  Fuck that.  A little difference.  Throw that vehicle into the jelly pit.  Oh, that's it.  Listen to me, George Washington Carver.  Take your fucking, yeah, yeah.  Because no one wants to be inconvenienced too much.  That's your thing.  That's inconvenient.  Yeah, you don't want to be inconvenienced too much either.  So, you know.  If all of a sudden they're saying a jar of peanut butter and nothing else is going to change,  you just got to maybe scoop some peanut butter in your thing every once in a while, then 
[03:16:00]  why not?  That's great.  If you're changing all kinds of stuff and your house has to run on peanut butter.  Then you have to do a full peanut butter, because when it gets old, it loses some of its peanut  butter.  You got it every five months.  You have to do a full peanut butter diagnosis.  You have to get it all out.  Yeah.  It's a couple of things that's inconvenient.  Yeah.  But it's just like driving an electric car.  You got to plug your fucking car in.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  And you don't know where the fuck plugs are, so you have to make sure you drive where this 
[03:16:30]  plug's going to be so you can plug your car in.  And that's another thing.  What do you think?  That juice coming out of the wall is free?  Well, you're charging your vehicle.  It's still using your electric, so you're going to be billed for that anyway.  So is it more economical than gas, than a different type of hybrid?  It's more safe.  Is it?  Is it really?  In terms of the environment.  Oh, is it?  Where do you think that energy comes from that's going into your fucking wall socket? 
[03:17:00]  There's a big generator that's got to be turned.  Who's doing that?  Fucking a cat?  A cat chasing a mouse on a fucking wheel?  Those guys with the big legs from that fucking commercial.  Oh, Lord of the Rings?  No, you see that commercial?  Where the guys with the big...  What's that fucking commercial, man?  From Monster.com where the dudes with the big ass legs?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Monster.com one.  And they spin the earth with that big leg.  There's a guy with big legs riding a bike.  Let's say hi to Rick in Arkansas.  Rick, because all that shit runs on oil or like nuclear. 
[03:17:30]  Rick?  Hey, now I know what Rush Limbaugh's dreams were like when he was on Oxy.  Why?  Well, you know, you went from sucking Arab cocks to save your life to fucking peanut butter  cars.  Peanut butter cars.  All right.  We could be quietly saving the earth by having these kind of conversations from time to time.  Just never know.  Just the peanut butter concepts. 
[03:18:00]  Did you see that show on...  Where was it?  Discovery of History.  What will happen to the earth when the humans are gone?  I heard about it.  I saw clips.  I want to see that too.  Oh, it was god awful.  Was it?  Why?  It just sounded like it was going to be interesting.  It's like the trees will start growing again and weeds and vines and that's that.  And then the environment will pretty much go right back to where it was before humans  were on this earth.  It would just be better, basically.  Yeah.  And it wouldn't take that much time, actually.  No?  Especially in human terms. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  That shit is crazy.  And the only thing I don't believe in is the meteor.  And that's it.  Oh, the big meteor going to hit us?  I just don't think if it hits us, it'll mean a fucking thing.  You think that's all hype, like a big snowstorm and everything else?  They'll be like, oh my god, and then it'll hit and kind of fuck some shit up.  But then it'll be like, ah, we're okay.  If a rock as big as Manhattan hits the earth, comes from space, as big as Manhattan hits  Manhattan, Manhattan will be fucked up.  There'll be an evil tidal wave somewhere if it hits the ocean. 
[03:19:00]  But the whole world and we go into...  You don't think a bunch of dust will go into the atmosphere?  Close out the sun and then...  Fucks now.  You know why the dinosaurs died?  Why?  The meteor hit the earth.  AIDS.  Shook a lot of things.  And all the food, like, got knocked over.  And then it rotted.  And then the dinosaurs couldn't eat anymore and they starved to death.  Because dinosaurs didn't have fucking...  We would adapt to a meteor hitting the earth.  We would?  Yes.  Dinosaurs didn't have doctors and all that bullshit.  They died of fucking rectal cancer like everybody else. 
[03:19:30]  You know something?  They had a pretty good run.  Yeah.  Because they lasted a fuck of a lot longer than we've been here.  That's for sure.  A few people checking in.  What if your car ran on garlic butter saw?  Garlic butter saw.  Garlic butter saw.  Well, they have the cars that run...  It's sort of a modified diesel engine.  Sure.  And it could run on...  Willie Nelson's into that. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  It runs on, like, French fry oil that they dump in the back of McDonald's and shit.  And you pour it in there.  And it runs a...  It's a diesel motor.  Come on, man.  We got...  We can...  We can do better.  French fries can you eat, though?  Come on, really?  We can do better.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  I think.  Well, by the way, yes...  The corn thing, the corn oil thing is kind of a bust.  Rich in Staten Island has reminded me there is a satellite that's going to hit the Earth.  It's out of control.  It's going to hit somewhere.  I'd like to dream that, like, it's going to just hit some dope walking down the sidewalk 
[03:20:30]  in a city somewhere.  But they're going to have it all figured out.  So don't you worry.  They're going to know exactly where that fucking thing is falling.  They say this one's pretty out of control.  But they're...  What are they worried about?  They'll know in time.  Like, they'll have some notice.  They'll know within...  They'll know pretty accurately where it's going to hit.  But what if it's like, it's going to hit Manhattan?  There's nothing they can really do about it.  And just say it's just going to hit Manhattan?  Yeah.  They'll find something to do. 
[03:21:00]  Take your vacation time.  What do you want from me?  I remember being a kid.  Do you think they'll find something to do?  Look.  Shoot it out of the sky.  What was the satellite that...  It's the size of a bus.  They'll do a James Bond thing where they tie pad and shoots on it.  What was the satellite that fell when we were growing up?  Skylab.  Skylab, right.  I remember being a caddie just convinced that it was going to hit me on the head while  I was caddying.  In Australia?  Well, it ended up in Australia.  But I think, if I remember correctly, they didn't know back then.  They didn't have as much shit going on. 
[03:21:30]  No, they knew at the last minute where it was going to come down.  Remember how paranoid you felt?  Like, you kept looking up at the sky like, I wonder if...  How big is this thing, yo?  This thing's about the size of a bus.  City bus?  What are they worried about?  It's a spy satellite.  Not controlling where it is.  So they don't know what's in there.  Yeah, all of its engines are dead.  So it's just kind of...  Its orbit is decaying and then it'll just come through the atmosphere and crash somewhere.  A little of it'll burn up.  You ever...  Did we play the audio for you of Water Car Guy? 
[03:22:00]  No.  Oh my god.  He's our favorite fucking guy.  Poor Water Car Guy.  Do we have that?  Can we play that real fast?  This got me agreeing with fucking Bill Burr on his stupid conspiracy shit.  It got me agreeing with him.  Alright, Water Car Guy after the break.  Yeah, we gotta discuss this with Patrice a little bit.  Patrice, this is one of our favorite things of recent months.  Okay.  Guy figured out how to, like, run cars on water.  Yeah, he runs cars and you just gotta pour water in.  Is that not better for you? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, well, apparently not.  Is that not sexy sounding to you?  It sounds great.  Water, it's the simplest thing.  There it is.  Pour it in your tank, away you go.  Let's keep it at that.  We'll do it after the break.  I think Patrice will be pretty amazing.  This guy's great.  My good old Stan Meyer.  I want to hear some of Stan Meyer's quotes.  Myers or whatever, yeah.  Stan Meyer's after the break.  He's great.  Oh my god.  The news story itself is classic.  It deserves a replay, a revisit.  This is the first break since we've been here.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh shit.  Look at us.  All right, get us out of here for a few. 
[03:23:00]  What are people saying about the Opie and Anthony show?  It's funny.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've only listened to it a couple times.  I'm just here because my boyfriend's here.  Um, I, oh god, I can't improv for shit.  Um, um, I don't know.  Truth be told, I never wake up early enough to listen to the radio.  They're the big, uh, Opie and Anthony fans.  I just had to show them how to get here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:23:30]  Ah, where the hell are we?  Hello?  What the hell?  Uh-oh, don't do anything wacky with the headphones.  What'd you do?  I don't know what's going on.  Who touched something?  How's that sound?  I don't know, but I'm afraid to put my headphones on.  No, put your headphones on.  All right, don't.  There we go.  That's good for me.  No, it sounds all right, right?  I'll turn mine up, like, a little bit.  I might have been fiddling, Mars.  Don't worry.  I don't know.  All right.  That's good.  Because I can't figure out which is the cue speaker.  Not the cue speaker, the monitor speaker. 
[03:24:00]  Which one is that?  Why CR?  What does CR stand for?  Control room?  No.  That ain't working.  That's silly.  That's just silly.  Every day I have that same problem, because I'm like, CR, what the fuck?  Control room?  CR?  I don't like it.  How about a little sign that says monitor?  Monitor.  We've got to think way too much every fucking day.  I can't be bothered with trying to figure out codes.  CR. 
[03:24:30]  Mars does a great job, though.  Patrice, so we weren't even going to go down this path.  By the way, I want to acknowledge the listeners out there that helped kind of steer the show.  And they don't even know they're steering the show at times, because you don't get the credit.  But all of a sudden, like someone said, what about Stan Meyer?  And it's perfect for the discussion today.  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a lot of listeners out there that really, truly helped steer the show, and I just want to thank them.  They don't get much credit, and they're nameless and faceless, but you really do help. 
[03:25:00]  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  So Stan Meyer there, Patrice, he's this guy.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Go ahead and listen to this.  Where's your mic?  Oh.  You're over there?  Yes.  Oh, there he is.  All right.  Okay.  I'm used to turning on Jimmy's mic, but Jimmy's mic is over there, and there's just a spotlight  on it today.  That's all it is.  A little spotlight on Jimmy's mic.  Yeah.  In honor of the fact that he's no longer with the show.  Patrice. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  Stan Meyer.  Okay.  This guy is a classic.  The guy comes up with the water-powered car in 1998, a mere 10 years ago, and you might  be asking yourself, well, why aren't we driving?  Why isn't everybody driving around in water cars?  The water-powered car.  There's plenty of water.  Why didn't someone give him that before we started? 
[03:26:00]  Because now he knows what happened to Stan Meyer.  Oh, no.  Well, seriously, I'm just...  It's a very interesting story.  We should play the clips.  All right.  Here's the clip, Patrice.  I certainly didn't blow anything.  On the water-powered car.  I mean, this was not some kook.  He figured it out, and he wanted the world to know.  Yep.  So he talked to a reporter.  Well, this is a news report on the water-powered car.  On the top of our news here at 6 o'clock, an age-old dream becoming a reality.  A local inventor has discovered a way, hear this, to use water to run your car. 
[03:26:30]  It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy.  And as Ralph Robinson explains, the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project.  Whoa!  Water has always been considered a precious commodity, but Stan Meyer's invention may make it even more valuable.  He has developed what's called a water fuel cell.  It has taken the place of his old gas tank.  The water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is used to run his dune buggy.  I don't care if you use rainwater, wellwater, citywater, oceanwater. 
[03:27:00]  If you don't have any fresh water, go ahead and use snow.  If you don't have any snow available to you, then use saltwater because there's no adverse effect to the fuel cell.  And if it comes down to it, you can just pee into the gas tank or you can spit into it.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Just get it moist.  You don't even need water.  Just get it moist.  Runs on air.  Yeah.  Cry into it.  Blow your nose into it.  Whatever.  And at night, we played this clip, I think Danny found it, and we went, guy's so dead.  Dead.  Dead.  When the newscaster goes, and the Pentagon's even interested, it was like, oh no. 
[03:27:30]  Oh no.  Not the Pentagon part of the Pentagon that we all hear about.  Yeah.  It's that little part right in the middle somewhere.  Yeah.  And deep in the Pentagon, and underground maybe.  Underground.  Where they go, oh shit, another guy figured out how to do the water cart thing.  Luckily, if you're in the Pentagon, and you see a door, and you go, where does that door  lead to?  And everyone goes, oh, you just don't want to know.  There is a department of guys that invent water cars. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  And there's a special department that takes care of those guys.  And he was taken care of.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  Oh, let me finish doing this shit.  All right.  Here's the second part of it.  Myers started working on this project four years ago.  He's not a scientist.  He isn't even a chemist.  In fact, he never graduated from college.  Myers was determined, he says, to design something to protect this country from oil embargoes.  And we calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York, we would 
[03:28:30]  roughly use 22 gallons of water.  The Pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week to look at Myers' invention.  That's what they did.  There's talk of possibly using it in the Star Wars defense program and to run army tanks.  Myers is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars.  It will cost about $1,500.  He says it won't need any maintenance, and you won't have to replace it.  It'll be at least two years before the fuel system goes into mass production.  The data happens and we won the fuel industry hate, but it'll put a smile on the face of those  who've had to say at one time or another, fill her up. 
[03:29:00]  You know, they have a lieutenant colonel, was it, that visited him from the Pentagon?  For the Star Wars program.  Hey, they might want to use some of that technology.  And you never have to replace the engine, so you're taking the engine guy and putting  him on the unemployment line.  That's what I was talking about with the whole economy thing.  Great.  So did they find this guy with a bottle of sleeping pills glued to the back of his wrist? 
[03:29:30]  Why would he want to kill himself?  And a handwritten note?  A handwritten suicide note?  Maybe in the movies it happens like that.  Yeah, stop.  This is real life, Patrice.  That's stupid movie crap, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Got any more on him?  Was there a watery knoll somewhere?  Oh, Jesus.  Even the Pentagon is interested.  Yeah.  The red alert when they went to DEFCON. 
[03:30:00]  I don't think you ever want the Pentagon interested in your life, ever, ever, ever.  No.  In what you're doing.  Ever, ever, ever.  And this is just some guy who stumbles upon a way to run his car on water.  That's it.  Me and a good friend of mine talk about these type of things all the time, and I go, here's  the thing that keeps me from being the biggest conspiracy theorist ever, is that, okay, let's  say this poor guy, he invents this fucking thing that becomes amazing. 
[03:30:30]  And you go, there's guys out there.  I mean, everything is run by people.  So there's some guy with 14 stars on his jacket goes, listen, fellas, you three, men  in black, go and throw this guy down an elevator shaft?  And they go, yes, sir, and just, like, I don't believe in that much lack of humanity.  Just like, I don't believe there's aliens ever were here, ever. 
[03:31:00]  I don't believe in it, just because I don't believe in people's ability to be that in  non-robotic, or people's ability to be that robotic where they go, okay, there's a fucking  creature from another planet.  I am a human.  Something from another world is in that room, but I'm just going to keep it, mom's the fucking  word?  Maybe because if you say something, those three people come to your house and throw you down 
[03:31:30]  an elevator shaft.  But that's what I'm saying, like, there's guys that are just willing to just take a  guy that could change the world and just go, yes, sir, I will fucking cut his goddamn  eyeballs off.  Well, why don't we just say what happened to...  Well, I like when we did this the last time, and I know this is like deja vu for a lot of  people, but we're going to replay the audio, and Anthony's going to hit the bell every  time there's a problem here.  Every time there's a problem.  And by problem, I mean just any time something's said that perhaps might get this guy in a 
[03:32:00]  little bit of a jam.  How about this?  It would make the men in black guys a little uncomfortable.  A little uncomfortable.  Right.  It makes it a little more fun to listen to this.  Okay.  The top, our news here at six o'clock, an age-old dream becoming a reality.  A local inventor has discovered a way, hear this, to use water to run your car.  It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy. 
[03:32:30]  And as Ralph Robinson explains, the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project.  Water has always been considered a precious commodity, but Stan Meyer's invention may  make it even more valuable.  He has developed what's called a water fuel cell.  It has taken the place of his old gas tank.  The water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is used to run his dune buggy.  I don't care if you use rainwater, well water, city water, ocean water.  If you don't have any fresh water, go ahead and use snow.  If you don't have any snow available to you, then use salt water because there's no adverse 
[03:33:00]  effect to the fuel cell.  Jesus.  And right there, even if he had a chance to live with the water, because people, I mean,  don't forget they sell water in a fucking bottle.  So somebody's going, okay, we can, but you can't harness and control water.  That's the problem.  The beach.  Yeah, yeah.  Just going down with buckets to the beach and getting free fuel.  To fill up your car so you could drive around.  Oof.  Meyer started working on this project four years ago. 
[03:33:30]  He's not a scientist.  He isn't even a chemist.  In fact, he never graduated.  Oh, man, you're not playing the game.  Sorry, I had my machine was all screwed up.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Meyer started working on this project four years ago.  He's not a scientist.  He isn't even a chemist.  In fact, he never graduated from college.  He says to design something to protect this country from oil embargoes.  And we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York, we would roughly use 22 gallons of water.  The Pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week to look at Meyer's invention. 
[03:34:00]  There's talk of possibly using it in the Star Wars defense program and to run Army tests.  Meyer is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars.  It will cost about $1,500.  He says it won't need any maintenance and you won't have to replace it.  It'll be at least two years before the fuel system goes into mass production.  The day it happens, we won the fuel industry H, but it'll put a smile on the face of those who've had to say at one time or another, fill her up.  Shit.  Oh, good Lord. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, shit.  Right?  Yeah, boy.  So, now we tell you what happened to Stan Meyer.  Oh, okay.  Because according to that news story, then by the year 2000, we should have seen some of these cars on the road.  We should all be driving them.  Well, he was apparently eating dinner.  Yes.  At a Grove City, Ohio restaurant.  When it is reported, Patrice, that he jumped up from the table, yelled that he had been poisoned, and rushed out into the parking lot where he collapsed and died. 
[03:35:00]  It has been reported by Meyer's associates that Meyer had just secured funding for a $50 million research center near Grove City, but there's no way to confirm or reject this at the moment.  Holy shit.  So, they probably put a Marilyn Monroe dress on him.  And what was it?  There was no, like, there were no plans or anything, or drawings. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, we looked into it deeper.  There's, like, no proof that he ever came up with anything.  Yeah, yeah.  He never.  And if you get too nosy trying to reconstitute this guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, to make this thing, like, hey, his dream and vision.  You'll end up from.  You'll fucking get visited by the men in the night.  By the lieutenant colonel from the Pentagon.  With the sunglasses.  Yeah, yeah.  Even a lieutenant.  And I'm sure the lieutenant colonel visited him and was like, hey, hello, how you doing? 
[03:36:00]  Let's take a look at the.  Why don't we take a look at what you got around back?  Jesus.  Here it is.  Blah, blah.  Oh, and you pour the water in here?  Is it?  Okay.  And he didn't know he was looking at end of his life guy.  End of his life guy.  It was murder.  Murder.  What the fuck, man?  And you don't believe.  You must believe.  That's the one where Bill Burr.  You must believe that the government has something to do with it.  Bill Burr.  I think the government was here.  He does horrific things that we don't want to know about.  He knew about this guy.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  And when we went through this whole thing the first time, I was like, oh, my God, I'm  right with you, Bill.  The government, someone in the government, at least, you know, I'm not saying the president  knew about this.  You don't think there's a cure for the common cold in a fucking, one of those Jurassic Park  freezers just there.  You don't fucking think there's a cure for AIDS.  If somebody said, I found a cure for the common cold, he'd be dead as a motherfucker.  You think?  Because the common cold is worth, it must, if you go industry, oil, car, the common cold 
[03:37:00]  has to be in the top five.  Yeah.  So if you find a cure for that.  Over-the-counter medicine.  How much money is spent fighting the, yeah, the common cold?  Just fighting the cold.  That's what I was trying to tell you earlier about the economy thing.  You can't just, like, cure the cold because a whole industry would be, you know, destroyed.  Well, how about the fact that we're destroyed?  How about making, how about maybe we live?  It's an equal kind of balance, I guess. 
[03:37:30]  There's enough people coming in that they're going out and we're keeping.  And it's not like the plague where everyone's dropping dead.  So they keep it kind of, you know, even.  There's a doctor.  I forgot his fucking name.  My girl knows his name.  But he, he, they have him on, like, black radio stations.  This guy comes on and he cured AIDS.  This motherfucker cured AIDS.  What the fuck is his name that cured Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr.?  He cured AIDS, man. 
[03:38:00]  Like, magic doesn't have AIDS anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, magic doesn't.  Yeah, it's not even traceable anymore.  No one can look.  In his blood, right?  No one, no one can see that as maybe a misdiagnosis.  Like, everyone's thinking this miracle that Magic Johnson cured of AIDS.  I'm just thinking misdiagnosis.  Imagine the doctor.  He never had it.  The doctor gave him the wrong freaking info and went off.  Yeah.  You can't tell him.  He got easy ease test results back.  I'm sorry.  A dyslexic doctor.  You got IHV.  I'm so sorry. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, I know the doctor.  Is Dr. cocking his ass?  Ah.  No, I said you were the MVP.  Why the fuck don't we embrace more of these things?  Like, people will most likely be proven to be quacks.  This guy would have been proven to be a nut job and something.  But not murder him.  Murder this motherfucker?  Well, that's what he says.  I mean, there's a lot of controversy surrounding that guy.  So, a lot of people say the whole thing was a hoax and all that.  Of course.  Oh, yeah?  But then the other people go, well, of course he's looked at it as a hoax now because they 
[03:39:00]  destroyed his buggy.  His dune buggy.  His dune buggy and destroyed all the shit that he...  His dune buggy's in Area 51, too.  They took his files and everything.  So, you don't know who to believe on that one.  The news believed it because they did a whole story on it.  It says Wikipedia has Stan Meyer in there and you'll see his invention is bullshit.  It's a perpetual motion machine hoax.  I don't know what that's about, but...  So, what about... 
[03:39:30]  Okay, what makes people decide...  The Sabbath's gadget?  What makes people decide who not to kill?  And let's say the guy who said, I invented the battery.  Why wouldn't the people who invented plugs in the wall want to kill the battery, motherfucker?  The battery.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Like, the outlet people go, we gotta kill this nigga.  He invented something that they don't need to plug in our wall, nigga.  So, we gonna kill the battery, motherfucker.  Right.  Hey, I don't know what...  Or why doesn't the hat, the hat, motherfucker kill the umbrella, motherfucker? 
[03:40:00]  That's a good question.  Brian in Virginia.  Brian?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  All of you guys love the show.  Thanks.  Hey, I saw a program on, like, A&E or Discovery a couple years ago, and they were talking about  the guy who was in Iron Butterfly.  I think he was a guitarist for the bassist, and his father was a scientist.  And when the band broke up, he went to be a scientist with his father, and one of the  things that they had developed was a water car.  And they had done something very similar, where they were making a lot of noise in the  scientific community and getting a lot of attention. 
[03:40:30]  And then one day, they just disappeared, and they weren't able to be found until somebody  driving down the highway had seen a car down in the trees somewhere, and they just determined  that it was an accidental car crash.  But it was always suspicious, because they could never figure out why the car just happened  to have gone down the trees like that.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, one of the guys from Iron Butterfly, his death to this day is very suspicious.  Holy shit.  Was it that he was working on a car that ran on water?  I thought it was some other invention. 
[03:41:00]  No, it was...  I thought he had some...  It worked on water, just like this.  I thought it was...  I thought it worked for the military in some capacity, like he was...  It was something.  I don't know if it was a...  Was it a water car?  He should have just kept playing that riff.  Yeah.  Don, don, don, don, don, don, don, don.  He didn't live forever.  I ain't got a video, baby.  It didn't matter much, because I don't think he was an original member anyway, so...  Oh, well, screw him then.  I think he was one of the replacements for one of the original guys.  That's what happened to Bonham. 
[03:41:30]  I think he was trying to invent a plane that flew on peanut butter, and that motherfucker  wound up dead.  The government was very angry.  He was working on a car that ran on owl eyes.  Owl eyes.  I think Janis Joplin...  A car that runs on cheetah heels.  Janis Joplin was trying to invent an apparatus.  But she doesn't even know the bit, you dope. 
[03:42:00]  You came up with cheetah heels.  I remember cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels, yeah.  Owl eyes.  Owl eyes.  Oh, we laughed at...  You know what the funniest one out of all that was?  Oh, it was whale, whale blowhole that you had.  You cut the whale's blowhole out, and it sunk to the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah, the rest of the whale was a complete waste.  It couldn't seal up.  Cheetah heels, was it?  Cheetah heels.  Because we just started talking about...  That was one of the funniest...  That was so funny.  And you take away the most important...  Owl eyes.  Was it the delicacies that we were looking to eat things? 
[03:42:30]  It's the tastiest parts.  There's cheetah heels, there's owls.  And the thing that they needed to live, and you cut out the blowhole, and he had no more  muscles to shut it.  So he would have to stay to the top of the water until...  He just got tired.  And birds, he would have had to take a...  Because birds would have been sitting on him, just pecking at him, and it would have  been too much...  Just falling into his blowhole.  He would have went under the water and had no muscles to stop the water from...  He would have sunk to the bottom and died while we were eating blowhole sandwiches.  Eating this blowhole is delicious. 
[03:43:00]  And humans are so disgusting, we wouldn't even care if the rest of the whale was completely  made.  We wouldn't even eat the rest of the whale.  No tail.  No, nothing.  No fin.  The rest tastes like shit.  Just the blowhole tastes good.  Just blowhole.  Elephant eyelids is coming in.  That's right.  Also, gorilla elbows.  Thank you, Batch Freddy.  Gorilla elbows.  Like, the rest of the gorilla is a waste.  It's just the...  Oh, you just leave them, like, dead in the jungle.  And you can see where you've cut his elbows off.  Right.  But cheetah...  It's not too far-fetched, man.  Cheetah heels.  We're pretty much doing that shit with the elephant. 
[03:43:30]  Saw the tusks off of elephants.  At least the rest of them.  Cheetah heels was magnificent, because he just kneed the cheetah heels.  Chester's liver's saying it all started with hippo knees.  But what was the thing we were talking about?  And gorilla pecs, that's right.  Gorilla pecs sandwich.  It was his pecs.  We needed gorilla pecs sandwich.  Gorilla pecs paninis.  You know what I would love?  I would just love a nice fried parrot throat sandwich. 
[03:44:00]  Aardvark snout.  Like what he eats with.  You dice it up.  Oh, that brought back memories, man.  Holy shit, man.  Let's go to Rich in Tampa.  Rich, why would you be calling the Opie and Anthony show?  I am calling because I wanted to give Patrice a shameless plug.  I'm excited to see him Thursday down at the Improv in Tampa at 8 p.m.  Thank you, sir.  Look at that.  Very nice.  I'm excited to come down there, actually.  Patrice might remember me. 
[03:44:30]  I'm the guy who called his Black Phillips show, the one who hadn't gotten laid in seven years.  Seven years.  What happened to you?  You get laid?  Have you gotten laid yet?  Yes, I have.  Good man.  Good man.  Oh, yes.  I remember you, too, man.  Me being on your show, a lot of good things happened.  Thank you, sir.  Doug is saying, Waltham, Mass.  Opie, the best was the pulverized hummingbird esophagus.  Yes.  And a pate.  Yeah, yeah, pate.  Hummingbird pate.  Have we played that bit a while? 
[03:45:00]  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Fried hummingbird wings.  Get me rocking.  Have we played that a while?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Let's get it on right at 11.  Fuck it.  That's a good one.  Patrice, by the way, I saw your, what was it, Def Jam thing you did?  Oh, God damn.  Very funny.  Thank you.  Really fucking funny.  I would absolutely say, if you're going through the channels and you see that one, check it  out.  The Def Jam thing?  Yeah.  They cut a lot out, though, but it's still...  I could tell, like, you had a lot more.  Yeah.  And I wished I would have seen the whole set. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, they was mad, too.  Them girls, like...  Oh!  When I came on, my girls been with me for five years.  I've been with her for eight months.  Yeah.  And just, it was like six guys just started laughing, and the rest of the crowd was like,  what just happened?  Dude, I was fucking howling really good.  Thank you, sir.  Will that be on DVD?  I don't know what they'd do with Def Jam.  They should do DVD and all the stuff they didn't use, man.  Come on.  God damn.  And now they're all coming in. 
[03:46:00]  We might just try to replay the bit.  Opie, the best was the crab eye stem meat.  Did you say that?  Oh, the little stems?  The crab eye stems?  I didn't say that.  Oh, the things that the eyeballs sit on.  The little stems that the eyeballs sit on.  So we don't want the eyes, but we've got it.  He's got to lose his eyes for us to get stemmed.  Because the stems just taste so good.  And you need, like, friggin' millions of them.  Wiping out a whole population just to have an appetizer.  Oh, who else?  Just to smear it on a cracker. 
[03:46:30]  Was it kangaroo hamstrings?  I don't know.  It should have been.  If I remember the bit, it started out stupid, and then we decided it had to be the most important  part of the animal.  And that was the most delicious part.  Right.  Yeah.  Crab eye stem meat.  I was talking to you, the stems.  Just that little thing.  For us, listen, for me to eat the stem, he has to lose his eyes.  He's got to lose his eyes.  Now, I don't want him to lose his eyes, but boy, that stem is delicious.  There's a way to save his eye and just take the stem and drop his eye where the stem ended 
[03:47:00]  and heal it.  Kangaroo pouches.  It was their legs.  It was something with the legs.  Yes, with his hamstring.  But you know where it started, I think?  I think, if I'm not crazy, we was talking about veal.  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  And it was how to make veal.  And it was like, I think I was saying why I don't eat veal.  And that's exactly what it was.  I think I don't eat veal.  And he was like, why not?  And I think, just because I said, I don't want an animal to just have to suffer that 
[03:47:30]  much.  And then we started going into, if I'm not crazy, but I might be wrong.  I think that was it.  But cheetah heels closed the show down.  Cheetah heels.  And something owl scalp.  Was it owl scalp?  I don't know.  I think it was something with his eyes, owl retinas or something.  I don't even know.  Something.  Because they're very important.  Their eyes.  Horse calves.  That was one of the funniest bits of last year, man.  Oh, man.  Just the funniest fucking bits of last year. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  We're getting ready for line of the day.  If we can't find it for today, we'll play that bit maybe tomorrow or something.  I've heard it on the best of, man.  I laughed at it.  If it hasn't run recently, we'll throw it on today.  Before Ron and Fez, of course.  Noon to three.  Ron and Fez.  Noon to three.  You know what the problem is?  When we talk about bits, we're going to play at 11 o'clock.  People that are here in the replay go, where was the bit?  Well, there's a special thing that happens between 11 and 12.  You get material that is not rerun the rest of the day.  I think people understand that by now. 
[03:48:30]  So that's the reason.  So maybe, I don't know.  If you record the show, you might want to go all the way to noon every day so you can  get a little tidbit, a little bit that we just throw in there.  That's right.  To get us to Ron and Fez.  Alligator gums.  Someone was saying, yes, it was owl scalp.  Owl scalp.  Was that tasty?  And I think, what was the pate?  Oh, you made, you know what you did?  It was just, you did a, he did, Anthony did a long thing about rich people just eating 
[03:49:00]  a whale blowhole pate.  Was it?  Yeah.  And he had that, that voice of the.  Oh, yes.  Loving.  Pasty.  Yes.  The, it was whale blowhole pate.  And there's the whale just like nose first down in the, on the bottom with the other fish  eating at him.  Oh, cause you can't, you can't.  Lungs just filled up like.  You cut the muscle.  Gallons of water were just pouring in that hole, like watching it go down a drain during  a rainstorm. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, it was hummingbird pate.  That's what it was.  Hummingbird pate.  And just delicious.  And all this.  This is so.  Maybe it was hummingbird esophagus pate.  Pate.  Gonna have to listen to it.  Yeah.  Cause I'm, I'm getting, I'm getting them all mixed up.  Oh my God.  Cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels.  Danny did a lot of.  Koala nose.  It was, it was.  Koala.  Humming.  It was pate in a koala nose. 
[03:50:00]  It was stuffed, stuffed koala nose.  Holy shit.  We have a super agent, Bob Eatman outside of the studio.  So we got to get off the air right at 11 today.  Danny did a lot of research on the FCC, FCC complaints that have come in.  And some of these are hilarious.  We want to get to this today, but we ran out of time.  For example, while watching the world series, Fox advertised for the Simpsons. 
[03:50:30]  The commercial shows a homosexual encounter with an alien.  I think this is inappropriate for the audience that would be watching this program.  That's somebody who absolutely has no business writing a letter to the FCC because they don't  understand that that's fine.  Dear FCC, another one.  I'm writing to complain to you about the Fox television show, The Simpsons.  The episode to which I'm referring is the one recently aired on WTDF in where Homer takes  a job as Mr. Plow. 
[03:51:00]  Mr. Plow is clearly a vile sexual reference.  And as a devout Christian, I feel this kind of television is vile and blasphemous.  One of the greatest Simpsons of all time.  Mr. Plow.  That's my name.  My name again is Mr. Plow.  That's without challenge one of the funniest Simpsons ever.  Mr. Plow.  And then he wants to fuck Marge.  And he goes, Mr. Plow.  That's my name.  My name again is Mr. Plow. 
[03:51:30]  Mr. Plow.  Mr. Plow.  I don't know how the people at the Fox station sleep at night with Mr. Plow on their networks.  Yeah.  Perish the thought.  Oh, Lord have mercy.  Just a...  Well.  God bless Mr. Plow.  Well, yes.  Danny also constructed a game out of it.  Oh, really?  He created some false ones and your guy's job is to figure out which one's which.  Oh, well, that's hard now. 
[03:52:00]  So, out of the first two, is one of them fake?  I don't remember.  I have no recollection.  Here comes Danny.  That's my poker face.  Yeah.  I would say yes.  Out of the first two, is one of them fake?  One of them is fake.  Fuck.  One of them is fake.  I would have to say Mr. Plow is the fake one.  No way.  Guess my name.  Well.  Because the homosexual one.  People are very upset about homosexuality.  I'm going to go with the homosexual encounter with an alien. 
[03:52:30]  I agree with you.  Because I don't think Danny was smart enough to do a fake TV station.  That's the only reason.  You know what?  It's not very nice.  Sorry.  Too much detail.  Jesus.  I agree with you.  Not that Danny's dumb, but I do agree with homosexual.  It's just too much of a...  Too much detail about it.  Homosexuality really upsets people.  Unless Danny has poured through hundreds of these and is familiar with the format of certain 
[03:53:00]  complaints.  Are you on?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Why wouldn't he be on?  They already disconnected Jim's mic.  He's only been gone from the show one day.  Hello.  There it is.  All right.  Yeah.  I read through so many of these today.  And probably 98% of them either have to do with somebody disliking that their faith  was shat upon or homosexuality.  All of it.  God.  Unbelievable.  There must be thousands of FCC complaints on this show.  Which one was fake?  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  Well, do we want to give that away today?  Or would we like to tease this for perhaps tomorrow?  All right.  He's got to sit and wait.  That's fine.  The next one.  The FCC needs to do something about this now and fast.  About this now and fast.  It is terrible and wrong to what happened and these people are not getting punished at  all.  I'm disgusted and horrified at what happened.  Fox allowed The Simpsons to air this Sunday night, June 17th at 7.30 p.m.  That was rated PG and it showed somebody.  Got any good music?  Wearing.  Oh, I don't. 
[03:54:00]  Mine doesn't work.  S&M gear on the show.  This is terrible, disgusting, and degenerate for our children to watch the show.  Is TVPG so kids 8-year-old...  Wow.  Run on sentences that fucking don't make sense.  That's got to be real.  And degenerate for our children to watch the show.  Is TVPG so kids 8 years old and up are watching this and we must do something about it.  We, sentence continues, we have already filled the petition and there are about 80 people  who have signed to find that station or at least make sure no more smut and garbage and 
[03:54:30]  indescent.  They write indescent instead of indecent.  Defaming programming is shown when babies are watching television at 7 p.m.  showing S&M, period.  Okay, I'm going to read the sentence.  This is one sentence.  Holy shit!  Alright.  Breathe.  Alright, here's the sentence.  Fox allowed The Simpsons to air this Sunday night, June 17th at 7.30 p.m. 
[03:55:00]  That was rated PG and it showed somebody wearing an S&M gear on the show.  This is terrible, disgusting, and degenerate for our children to watch the show.  Is TVPG so kids 8 years old and up are watching this and we must do something about it.  We have already filled the petition and there are about 80 people who have signed to find  that station or at least make sure no more smut and garbage and indescent.  Defaming programming is shown when babies are watching television at 7 p.m.  showing S&M, period.  That is one sentence. 
[03:55:30]  Wow.  Wow is right.  Oh, ah!  The next one.  I am writing you to complain about the constant portrayal of Simpsons character Ned Flanders  as a goody-two-shoes Christian who can never be guilty of a sin.  I'm a lifelong Christian and while I do my best to adhere to the good book,  even I have engaged in immoral activities.  That's fake.  That's gotta be.  Example, drugs, anal sex.  Jesus, Danny.  Come on. 
[03:56:00]  The guy writes that he's offended, but then he talks about drug use and anal sex.  Come on, Danny.  Jesus.  That's great.  Danny, don't let him prove you to be the dummy he said you wanted.  Come on, Danny.  You gotta throw in one obvious one.  Yeah, the drugs part.  That's the red herring.  I was with you with the drugs.  Like he's gonna admit to anal sex to the FCC.  What the fuck?  I'm crying over here.  I'm not saying that.  I'm still crying. 
[03:56:30]  Linger longer.  It is obscene for all Christians to be depicted as such squares.  Please tell me how I can do something to change this.  All right, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's more fake.  Ooh.  You want another one?  Jesus, Danny.  Save some for tomorrow.  Save some for tomorrow?  Yeah.  How about one more good one before we leave?  Yeah, I mean, if you haven't fun with it,  we could always try and get some more together for tomorrow.  All right.  I want to just read one more good one, though.  Which one do you really like? 
[03:57:00]  Here.  Give me a copy.  Here you go.  My name again is Mr. Plow.  Ah, Plow.  Mr. Plow.  That's my name.  All right, we're getting ready for line of the day.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts  and up-to-the-minute snow conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com. 
[03:57:30]  Which one?  I like actually the very, very last one.  All right, cool.  The Simpsons cartoon features two women in swimsuits.  While there were no nudity,  this scene certainly was inappropriate  because women should be dressed conservatively  and obey the wishes of their husbands.  Just Danny's personal philosophy.  Got me again.  You know, as much as I do hate the FCC,  I do feel sorry for them  because I know they're just bogged down 
[03:58:00]  with such crap complaints  that they have to kind of filter through  to get to the ones they deem important.  And a lot of people seem to think  that the FCC is their place  where they can vent frustrations about shows  that they simply just don't like.  Right.  More than, you know, something that was...  Yeah, that's a violation.  Yeah, a violation.  Like, if they just don't like a show,  they'll complain to the FCC that they don't like it  and they want to get it canceled.  And if they don't understand,  that's not the venue to do that.  That's our biggest fucking problem, man.  It's like, all right, 
[03:58:30]  if you don't like the radio show,  just turn it off.  People are enjoying the horrible nature of the show  when we go down those roads.  People actually enjoy that.  We don't have to be PC  and have to be nice.  All right.  Line of the day.  Runner-up line of the day, go.  That's the one for checking the shipping  for all the docks for Terrace.  It's a hickory dickory dock.  And then my Jack be nimble,  Jack be quick,  Jack's a motor with candlestick. 
[03:59:00]  That's an energy thing I put in place five years ago.  That was fun.  I remember that like it was this morning.  Oh, shit.  Why did we even bother?  That was the first five minutes of the show.  Ooh.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, Pat from Munaki has a funny one.  It's just two simple words.  Boxcar.  So Pat from Munaki gets runner-up line of the day today? 
[03:59:30]  Pat from Munaki gets runner-up  because it was the boxcar.  Where do we send the check?  Cars, train cars that only have women in them.  We should send them a check.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  For 10 cents.  All right.  Here's your line of the day.  Thank you, SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:00:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I wrote this.  Certain times of the...  I wrote this.  Goddamn.  Those are funny.  See you, S-T-P.  Line of the day was written.  Well, it's good to know I'm funny on paper. 
[04:00:30]  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, if only you read it.  Oh, well.  Dave B. from Philly.  Go see Patrice.  His line on Def Jam of being blown like an ugly dude throwing dice  made me cry for 20 minutes.  Oh, damn.  Was that funny?  Yeah, dude.  Oh, for everybody in the Tampa area, you're crazy if you're not checking out Patrice this weekend.  Thank you.  I forgot about that.  The face.  Iraq.  Oh, that's funny shit.  We're starting to go through some old shows because I'm finally unloading boxes that have been sitting in many, many different houses for many, many years. 
[04:01:00]  And I'm finally digging into these things.  And we're starting a section on opianthony.com.  That's called old school opianthony, old videos, old audio, some you might have heard, but a lot of this stuff you haven't seen or heard in a long, long fucking time.  Ellen's dancing.  Yeah, I know.  And so I gave Iraq the tape of us doing Sperm Bowl 96 as in 1996. 
[04:01:30]  He's cutting that up.  And also.  18.  And a show we did while we were at AAF where we actually bombed a TV station because they took Real Rock TV off the air.  Home being the definitive word there.  Before we found our real home, which was on a Spanish station that had pretty much 23 hours of Spanish programming a day and one hour of Real Rock TV.  It's very embarrassing.  Actually, one hour of English-speaking programming a week. 
[04:02:00]  That's what I've heard.  It was a weekly show that ran like an hour.  Anyway, you cut up the bombing of the TV station show.  And tell me what you told me in the office.  It's quite possibly the greatest audio you guys have ever done.  Wow.  That's a compliment.  Okay.  Thank you.  I don't want to be here to listen to it again when you play it, but it's really good.  Go ahead.  We're in the barrel.  Take this opportunity, you dope.  We beat you up every day.  Read the thing off of the fucking CD. 
[04:02:30]  Where is it?  Do you have enough?  Just go ahead.  Say it.  There's some in-depth descriptions of the camouflage outfits and paint that you were wearing.  Why would we try to tell people we were wearing army gear?  There were some setups leading up to your big surprise, but you had to pause to keep doing  Ticket Blitz Thursday to give out Gallagher tickets. 
[04:03:00]  Ticket Blitzes for Gallagher tickets.  And that was upsetting our big assault.  That's why when these dopes on message boards go, they were so much better in the NEW days  and the AAF days.  I just laughed.  Why?  Because I have the tapes and I know that it's just flat out not true.  You know, I listened to the Mayor's Prank show recently because I was going through these  boxes.  I threw it on the background as I'm just doing my thing, right?  That show is so uncomfortable to listen to.  So not believable.  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  Hack as hack radio gets.  I can't believe one stupid person would believe that this was true and we got fired for it.  One stupid person.  And people will go, oh, when they did the Mayor's Prank, oh my God, it was like radio  gold.  No, it wasn't.  Our memories aren't right.  Radio aluminum.  We remember things differently than what they really were.  It's almost there.  And as far as the NEW days go, and I'll say it again, the only reason people do possibly  think that we were better on NEW is because we only allow you to hear when we were really 
[04:04:00]  good on WNEW.  All the crappy shows, they're buried.  Gone.  Gone.  So every time you do hear something from NEW, the majority of the people out there are  going to go, wow, that was really good.  Really funny.  Really entertaining.  Really cringy.  The cream of the crop.  That's right.  That's what we do.  It's like comparing like Led Zeppelin's box set with the greatest hits of Led Zeppelin.  Is it?  Yes.  Hmm.  Got no box sets. 
[04:04:30]  There's a lot of crap on box sets.  Yeah.  Oh, just horrific crap.  Anyway.  We rock.  There's Anthony's description of flying the vehicle that you used to drop the bombs.  Which were bras, right?  Were bras filled with...  Oh, no.  I wasn't sure if it was red paint or red water in balloons, and they were placed in the bras.  So you would drop the A-bombs first, then the Bs, Cs, down to the double Ds. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Stop.  I can't.  How are we going to listen to this one?  I can't even listen to him describing it.  Oh, this goes on for four and a half minutes.  Oh, God.  How are we going to listen to this?  I cannot listen to him even...  This is just...  Oh, this is bad.  This is just the start, by the way.  Oh, this is bad.  I've got boxes and boxes of stuff that has never been replayed.  And this is the days when no one gave a shit about us, so they weren't taping our shows.  This is like the only copy.  There's a fun game to play in a lot of these old shows where you can count the crutches 
[04:05:30]  being used in a lot of the discussions.  Count the crutches.  There's a lot of keywords that seem to show up all the time.  Yeah.  I think we're on the air, bro.  No.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The only reason we didn't do this today is because it wouldn't be fair to Jimmy.  Jimmy's filming a Kevin Smith movie today. 
[04:06:00]  It wouldn't be fair to him, so...  He's drooling to get his hands on this.  Oh, yeah.  He can't wait to be here tomorrow.  That little fucker's going to be sitting right there, staring at me, and just nodding  his head and smiling, going, no, this is really good.  This is really good.  I say we...  He's a little fucker.  I say tell Steve to invite Bob Kelly in for the XM show.  Oh, no.  Patrice, if you want to come back, you're more than welcome.  But I'm looking at the guys that we have beat up pretty badly over the years.  We'll give them a chance tomorrow.  Hey, Anthony!  I think we're on the air, bro.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[04:06:30]  We are heading for our aerial assault.  We're about 600 feet off the ground.  Turn it off!  We're heading toward our target.  And this is crazy.  People are looking up and waving at us, man.  This thing is unreal.  We're in a hot air blimp.  This thing is really small, and we're on a bombing mission, man.  We're going to bomb APU.  You've got to love that, man.  Turn it off, please.  What the heck is that?  What is it, a biplane?  Are you all right, bro?  Yeah.  That was a traffic copter.  I guess you're doing the traffic. 
[04:07:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we were just great when we were up in Boston.  Dude, I can't.  And there's a reason to ship.  Please, let's go.  I can't listen to this.  There's a reason this shit hasn't been replayed, man.  We bury this.  We know how to market ourselves.  Oh, woof.  What the fuck?  Oh, I am getting the douchiest chill.  Booby Man from Brooklyn. 
[04:07:30]  He writes, this is crazy.  Is it, Opie?  He goes, is it?  Is it?  And I could just read how he wrote it.  Is it?  There's another theme to all this old audio besides counting the buzzwords that you use.  Opie seems to be happy about every single thing that goes on in the show, whether it's coming back from a song, going to commercials, talking to somebody who came into the studio, taking a phone call.  He's always excited.  Yeah, and then they just fucking wore me down, these motherfuckers. 
[04:08:00]  And it continues to this day, I might add.  I used to be a happy, happy broadcaster.  We almost got hit by a traffic copter.  Well, yeah.  That was perilous.  Yeah, wow.  Holy douchey douche douche.  You all right, bro?  Yeah.  Not the traffic copter.  I guess they're doing the traffic reports.  Yes, they are.  We are very close to the Mass Pike.  We have actually just passed over the BU bridge, and I can see the Mass Pike.  And actually, traffic is really, really bad today.  It looks like all the cars are stopping and looking up in the air for some reason. 
[04:08:30]  Yo, dude!  You guys must have had a hell of a HDM light.  Who whistled Yo, dude?  Was that you?  That was probably me.  Look.  Crystal clear connection?  It's amazing.  Look.  You should hear them in the van going to the vehicle.  That they're going to fly.  Oh, yeah.  What were we thinking?  Like, why?  You know what?  This is when we fucking vaudeville. 
[04:09:00]  But this is when we used to show prep.  It's like oldie time radio.  We used to write.  Here we are in a dirigible.  We used to write our fucking radio shows.  All right.  We need a segment where we're in the van going to our aircraft.  I, like, wait.  Why did we do this?  This is so stupid.  Dude, you were months out of construction.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Up in the air for some reason.  No, man.  Yo, dude. 
[04:09:30]  And, dude, give us another blast.  We got it.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  It's a statey, man.  It's a state trooper company.  Oh, crap.  Yo, dude.  Back off.  All right.  In all fairness.  No, no.  There's no fair.  There's no fairness.  There's no anything.  I'll tell you this much.  I can't sit here and listen to this.  I'll tell you this much.  What?  We had them believing at the TV station because I swear to you.  Who was believing this?  What were we flying?  Because we were actually at the IHOP down the street.  Was y'all doing the finger hitting a microphone helicopter? 
[04:10:00]  Was that?  I don't know.  No, I think there were sound effects.  Do you remember what you were flying?  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ, you're on.  Was it like a blimp?  It was a miniature hot air blimp with some kind of propane-fueled engines on the side  to navigate, and it was only two people, so you had to fly while Ope navigated and was 
[04:10:30]  bombardier.  I.  I.  No.  Yo, dude.  Back off.  Back off.  Oh, man.  That copter was so huge.  Dude, it just blew us off course.  Give us another side of the propane, man.  Juice.  That's the propane.  All right.  Dude, dude.  I was just writing dude, dude, dude.  We are right at the Austin-Brighton interchange, and traffic is really, really backed up.  It looks like everyone is looking up at us, bro. 
[04:11:00]  Wow.  I am scared S-less, man.  And it's freezing up here.  It really is, but the view is awesome.  What acting.  You can see all the colors of the leaves changing.  And the other cops are wild, man.  What kind of copter sounds like that?  Unbelievable.  Patrice is pointing and sighing.  What, Patrice?  What the fuck?  Why are you playing this?  Let me explain.  Yes, Mr. O'Neill.  What bothers me about your old bits.  Thank you.  And you use it.  Please do it.  We're not good.  You guys, here's the difference. 
[04:11:30]  When you do a bit now, there's a tinge of sarcasm.  You know what?  You do bits for the purpose of making other things look bad now.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Then they did bits because they were bits.  And there's not a tinge of sarcasm.  No.  Or a tinge of sadness that they're doing it.  There's no awareness. 
[04:12:00]  There's no awareness.  There's no guilt.  There's no anger.  Isn't it better?  You were non-angry nothings back in the day.  Isn't it better to be something and then as you go along your career to laugh at what you were instead of being something.  And then along your career, then you become what you used to laugh at.  See, that's the worst thing.  If we became that and started out like this, oh, fuck. 
[04:12:30]  I'm trying to make excuses.  This is horrible.  One guy's just writing, dude, bro, dude, bro, dude, bro, dude, bro.  Another guy's writing, it's cold up there, Anthony.  Is it?  Holy shit.  One guy, Frank from Manhattan, he's a regular.  He writes, please tell me you two dorks were sitting in your chairs in the studio with goggles and leather flying helmets.  Wait a minute.  Dude, how'd they get a job, bro?  So, you know, we used to bitch about how we were underpaid up there. 
[04:13:00]  Yeah.  Frat boy radio.  I can picture both of you with hangers and scarves.  You made some scarves that looked like they were flying in the wind.  Steve, call up then.  He's laughing at me.  Somebody had a good feedback.  I think it was awful.  Somebody said, bro, the humanity. 
[04:13:30]  Opie sounds like Susan Wallman on that clip.  Oh, my God.  It's a traffic helicopter.  Matt LaFa.  Buddy, these guys are buzzing us like crazy.  This is nuts, but I see the targets.  The new ABU is inside, buddy.  Which one?  It's that one right over there next to the McDonald's.  Did you see McDonald's?  Oh, God.  Come on.  We got these bra bombs that we're going to be dropping on it.  We have a bunch of brassieres and water balloons full of red paint,  and we're going to be dropping them on top of ABU's building. 
[04:14:00]  I'm going to get that satellite dish, man.  Dude, if you get that satellite dish, I'll give you a case of beer, man.  Yeah.  All right, start getting everything ready, man.  Holy crap.  Shut this.  Shut it off.  That's what men drink.  Shut it the fuck off.  The game you play with.  Shut it off.  Hey, man.  I was going to give you a case of low points.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you a question.  All right, Patrice.  Let me ask you a fucking question.  Holy shit.  Don't get logical with this.  I am so hot.  Why?  I'm feeling hot and sweaty. 
[04:14:30]  You need to take some motherfucking Viking into something right there.  This is so bad.  What?  When did you change?  So what happened for you to change into this bothering you when you were so willing to  do it before?  I know.  I don't know.  What happened?  What happened?  What was the transition that made you go, oh, I can't listen to this shit?  I think it was, I got bitter with the business. 
[04:15:00]  I don't know.  I was just happy to be there and do anything.  Don't, don't.  Yeah, that's just what it is.  This was, this was like some kind of a, a big production number, you know?  Well, I like to know, it's curious, it's really not even a fucking dig.  It's like.  I don't know.  I mean, I've done bits.  I don't have an honest answer.  I would do bits, dude.  I used to do bits.  Malcolm XXL was my big bit.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, fat strangers say hi to me in, in, in the street.  Like I'm Malcolm XXL. 
[04:15:30]  XXL.  Fat guy joke.  Gotcha.  I listen to it now.  It makes my knees buckle.  Same shit.  But I'm like, where, at what, when did you, when was you so happy to do it?  And then you go, oh.  You know what?  I hadn't heard this in, since we did it.  And you know what?  So this is difficult to listen to.  And it wasn't like we did this and the phones were lit, like, what the fuck?  You guys are hacked.  Get the fuck off the radio.  We were actually getting ratings, ratings doing this.  How did they like this?  I don't know.  And then you, and then you just grow as a, as a broadcaster and you move into other things 
[04:16:00]  that hopefully are a little more real than this.  How did they like this?  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, hey, hey.  Day three of the war against ABU.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm Fat Albert.  You might as well just want Amber, baby.  I can't.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, hey, hey.  Day three of the war against ABU.  F you, ABU.  Day what?  Day what?  Day what?  We hate you.  ABU.  Did you say day three? 
[04:16:30]  Did you say day fucking three?  ABU.  That, if I don't remember, that was, that was on dial.  I think that was 77.6.  It's 68.  Yeah.  It's the PAX network now.  Yeah, well, and I had a nice slogan.  You know, F you, ABU, we hate you.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey.  I, uh, I would love to go back in time.  I guarantee y'all had a Steve Grogan, um, song.  And I would like to go back in time and meet the Opie of 1996, probably. 
[04:17:00]  Punch him in the mouth.  And fucking punch him in his asshole.  Along with the Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Send him back to knocking tin.  Wait a minute.  I'm glad to see you brought in your, uh, your fatigues.  Yes, I am dressed in full military regalia today.  We are in a war and Anthony and I both have our fatigues on and we're ready to go.  There's a reason for that, too.  Well, today is the day of retaliation.  Yes.  Now, they are sitting over there at their little TV station wondering what Opie and Anthony will do to retaliate. 
[04:17:30]  What do they have planned today?  I don't, I don't think they're gonna expect this one.  I guess you're just gonna have to wait and see, ABU.  I bet they're not.  Shaking in your boots a little bit today.  Retaliation will happen today on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is killing me.  It's serious.  That's right.  No more words, Pally.  No, it's not just our action.  This is killing me.  Our retaliation, that's all we can say right now.  You like this?  I'm a major today.  I see that.  I wanted to be a general, but I couldn't find the stars. 
[04:18:00]  I couldn't find with a major cluster thing here.  He just dropped us as an agent.  Listening to this, he doesn't realize why he ever took us on.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Remind us.  I don't think, I don't even want to do this to the faithful listeners.  I think Jimmy's not going to be in tomorrow.  He's still filming.  So we're going to have to do this on Thursday.  But on Thursday, call right away early on Thursday morning.  We want to get right to this.  Wait.  We are just being hammered on Pal Talk. 
[04:18:30]  I'm reading what the people are saying.  It's horrible.  There's a drinking game to this now.  Pally, buddy, dude, boy, bro, I'm crying.  Brother man.  Yeah, that's the big one.  There's brother man.  I was trying to make brother man like one of those things that everyone would say, and  it just never happened.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  Dude, this tape.  Dude, now I'm going to say it again.  Dude, bro, man.  This cassette, I found at the bottom of the box, the label was worn off. 
[04:19:00]  I could make it out.  It was pretty much off the cassette, like laying next to it.  And I didn't even think this cassette was even going to play anymore.  It was in a box that a mouse was in because there was like mouse droppings.  That's where it should have stayed, in the box of shit.  And chewed up press clippings.  It looked like this mouse was trying to make a nest, and this cassette was just sitting there.  And I unearthed.  I unearthed.  People are in genuine pain. 
[04:19:30]  They're saying this.  Fatigues.  What were they?  Assless chaps?  Spaggot.  Thank you.  Some of the tapes that you gave me the other day, I haven't gone through them yet, but  all they're labeled is Opie and Anthony weather and traffic updates.  I don't want to.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  I think I can't be sitting here any longer. 
[04:20:00]  It really freaks you out, right?  It freaks me out.  Look at this guy.  Just got 20 minutes of douche chills.  It freaks me out, but I don't know.  I like the uncomfortableness of it.  Oh.  I don't mind when we're in the barrel like that.  I really don't.  But this is a good exercise, though, because I just laugh inside.  Bro, it's totally raining, man.  Yeah, buddy, boy.  Raining, dude.  That would be one of the weather broadcasts. 
[04:20:30]  I'd laugh.  I always laugh inside when people try to say that the show is better during another time,  because I just know how ridiculous that is.  It's all very innocent, I guess.  Do you want to hear something else?  No.  No.  No, because I know you can't handle it, but this is...  You want to hear something really douche chilly.  The only station that really rocks, Beth Hart Band, Immortal. 
[04:21:00]  We love you, Beth Hart.  She's the troublemaker.  She's the troublemaker.  She wouldn't wear a bra.  She is one of the reasons why the TV show was banned by WABU in Boston,  because Beth Hart, in the footage of her playing that song for our TV show,  if she was not wearing a bra.  Right.  Oh, I forgot all about that.  That's what started.  Oh, her nips were popping out.  Yeah, her tiny little nips.  She, like, was...  She had nothing.  She was...  Yeah. 
[04:21:30]  Oh, God.  All right, well.  My mouth's all dry.  Here, put this in the vault so Anthony can't get...  I feel terrible.  I can't get...  I can't get...  I can't get...  Like the Red Baron.  Yeah, how come the helicopter sounded like old World War I planes?  Yeah, that's all they had in the special effects line.  Wait till I get brave enough to bring in my solo BAB shit.  That... 
[04:22:00]  That's going to be a rough one.  Shut up.  Where's the brood, the broad, dude?  Worst bonus time ever.  I don't think so.  It is for me.  I don't think so.  I have never seen the phones lit more in my life.  And the answer of feedback is spinning past the screen.  I can't even read them.  Anything else, Irak?  Well, this one was cut up first, so I didn't really keep tabs of all the crutches. 
[04:22:30]  But in Sperm Ball, there's actually tallies of everything you guys say.  What are some of the crutches?  Dude, bro...  There's man, bro, dude, brother man, tunes and tunage.  Oh, yeah!  Dude.  And we bitched that we were underpaid up there.  Oh, we should have been fired.  I'm fucking sending money back.  Oh, this is horrible.  And a lot of use... 
[04:23:00]  I guess it was a product sponsor, but Crank 2-0.  Ah, yeah, yeah, Crank 2-0.  I used to make coffee with that stuff.  It was caffeinated water.  And then you make coffee on top of it?  Holy crap.  It was way, way stronger than Red Bull.  Way stronger than Red Bull.  All right.  Tunage.  Someone is asking, is this theater of the mind?  This guy is actually saying... 
[04:23:30]  Hold on a minute.  He can't be real.  Mike in Illinois.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I never heard you guys in the NEW days.  I just don't like the old audio.  I love it!  Oh, okay.  And you're longer.  Now, let me be clear here.  That wasn't NEW tape.  Oh, no, no, no.  That was AAF tape.  That was very early AAF.  Yes.  So shut up.  If it was on the same tape as Spermball, that's 96.  That's 12 years ago.  Yeah, October. 
[04:24:00]  October of 96.  You sure?  That's what the date was.  No, it can't be.  Then that means it's...  Oh, wow.  October 95, it has to be.  That's what it was labeled on the tape, so that's what I wrote.  It has to be, because then Spermball would have been...  Spermball was October 96 as well.  Unless you wrote the dates wrong.  We did Spermball around the time of the Super Bowl.  That's the whole reason we did that.  How did we fucking beat people?  I don't know.  How did we beat, like... 
[04:24:30]  I don't know.  BCN in the ratings?  I don't know.  I'm fucking stunned.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And here's the sad part, like...  Stunk!  They replaced us in West Palm Beach with a show that sounded just like that.  Well, maybe they're looking toward the future.  I guess they want to go back in time.  Yes, Stan?  Well, no one else back then had the balls...  Thank you, Stan.  ...to do an air raid on a TV station.  With bras.  Steve!  Steve, reprimand him.  With bra bombs, Stan. 
[04:25:00]  Bra bombs.  And we had different sized bra bombs.  Yes.  For each letter.  Yes.  See, on the first pass, you want to drop your A bombs.  Right.  And then on your final pass, you want the big Ds.  The double D bombs.  That's right.  With the balloons and red paint.  Opie, as we're up here.  Now!  Oh!  A helicopter!  Then there was the list of casualties when you didn't hit the TV station.  There was a...  Oh, collateral damage? 
[04:25:30]  A postal truck.  A guy with binoculars.  Who wasn't looking in your direction.  And I'm sure...  Oh, dude!  Dude, you hit him, dude!  Did I, dude?  Stop, dude!  I did, dude!  No, dude!  Uh, John in New York.  John.  Oh, fuck.  I can't.  John?  Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.  Thanks.  I just wanted to ask, when you dropped the bras, did you say, bras away?  Fuck you.  I...  Dude!  Dude!  I wouldn't put anything past us on that tape. 
[04:26:00]  Wait till Jimmy hears this one.  That's great.  Oh, he is going to have a huge shit-eating grin on his face and, well...  Invite, uh...  Literally a shit-eating grin.  Invite Bob Kelly in Thursday morning.  Oh, great.  We gotta do this Thursday, because Jimmy's gone tomorrow, right?  All right, Patrice, thank you so much.  Tampa, starting Thursday?  Improv down there?  Yes.  All right, cool.  Tampa Improv, thank you.  Patrice, you were awesome today. 
[04:26:30]  Thank you.  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you, sir.  And you guys were awesome since 96.  7, 8.  And haven't stopped.  98.  I think we really got our stride.  Uh...  Yeah, there was a...  I think what happened...  If we're gonna be serious...  I think the anger we felt from the mayor's prank really turned us.  Mm-hmm.  I think that turned us around and made us, like, just angry fucks.  Yeah.  Because we couldn't believe we would actually get fired for something so ridiculous as that. 
[04:27:00]  Now get on the air.  Because it was...  Let me tell you something.  The mayor prank, the audio of it, was as realistic as that fucking bombing was.  That's what I'm getting.  I said that earlier.  Yeah, it's just...  I listened to that recently.  It's that bad.  That one's all over the internet, the mayor's prank thing.  And it's like, how does anyone get fired for that?  They should have fired us because it was so awfully hacked.  Fired us for the bombing pit.  But I bet you that's what happened.  After the mayor's prank, I'm starting to remember, we just became a little bit more bitter and we turned the corner. 
[04:27:30]  We turned it to heels.  And we kind of turned it to heels.  Thank God.  Said, you know what?  Fuck everybody.  Fuck you.  Fuck this.  And our personalities changed.  Hmm.  Wow.  I don't know, though, but we said some horrific things while we were in Boston, though.  Yeah.  I think after a while, we got kind of where we would talk real.  I think when we kind of decided we weren't going to play as much music and we were just going to bullshit.  Right.  I think that's when...  Dave Douglas had a lot to do with it, too.  We were able to...  Who was your big comp back then?  No one. 
[04:28:00]  Mark Parenteau?  Yeah, he was the guy that held the seat, but we thought he was going to be...  Held the little tender seat.  Oh, shit.  Ah, no, we weren't calling ourselves Preston and Steve back then, you fuck.  And see, Eric in Boston, I used to love you on AF, but there you go.  Yeah, what happened?  Your memory's a little different, isn't it, than what you just heard?  Let's get the fuck out of here.  God damn, I got to recover from that one. 
[04:28:30]  Yeah.  All right, man.  I'll see you in my life.  Our duties...  Our duties...  Our duties...  Have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.
