<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, along with Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane in studio, eagerly anticipating the arrival of Korn for a live performance.  However, Korn’s significant delay, originating from a 1 a.m. departure from Buffalo, NY, and still being in New Jersey hours later, sparked considerable frustration and humorous, expletive-laden speculation about their travel habits and potential excuses.  A trucker was called to realistically assess the travel time, confirming the band's lateness.  The hosts’ irritation was palpable, punctuated by frequent vulgarity.  The impending appearance on the David Letterman show was also discussed, along with the accompanying logistical headaches involving sponsor meetings (including one focused on Panasonic plasma TVs, which were already present in the studio) and transportation and dinner arrangements with the network. Numerous listener calls, interspersed with anecdotes and jokes, contributed to the raucous atmosphere, characterized by frequent use of crude and offensive language. The "Wow" segment was briefly touched upon, along with a caller’s suggestion that a Boulder, Colorado District Attorney be "tarred and feathered," referencing a mistaken arrest. Local weather and promotion of their upcoming Camden, NJ show were also included.

A rambling discussion about historical torture methods, including graphic details of tarring and feathering, the pear of anguish, and a spiked rack (informed by a visit to a torture museum), followed. This segued into speculation about the suspicious death of a former Giuliani press secretary, with the hosts analyzing the police report's wording.  The arrival of Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane, along with Korn, marked a significant shift.  A substantial portion promoted "Whip Him Out Wednesday," a segment whose details remained largely unexplained.  Further promotion included their Camden show and a ticket giveaway for the Family Values Tour at Jones Beach featuring Korn, with a planned ticket distribution outside the studio. Korn performed two songs live.  Listener calls continued, ranging from personal anecdotes (including one about a friend using a sock as a weapon after masturbating into it) to questions about Korn's career and the hosts themselves; one caller even revealed naming his son after Korn's frontman, Jonathan Davis.  Another caller complained about high resale ticket prices.


Korn's live in-studio performance was met with enthusiastic listener calls, including one from a security guard at Jones Beach requesting tickets. The subsequent segment featured a phone call with Dane Cook, who discussed his HBO special, "Vicious Circle," filmed in the round before 18,000 people.  He detailed the experience, post-performance anxieties, and anecdotes about the filming. The conversation touched upon Cook's MySpace popularity, potential "Tourgasm 2," and devolved into off-color jokes about Jessica Simpson (whose relationship with Cook was repeatedly questioned), John Mayer, and Andy Dick.  Listener stories, YouTube videos, and anecdotes about other comedians like Bobby Kelly further diverted the conversation.  The segment concluded with plugs for Cook's special, the Fort Lauderdale Improv, the Opie and Anthony show, and the Family Values Tour. Opie and Anthony’s walk to XM radio, including interactions with passersby (a homeless man receiving concert tickets), punctuated by their usual street banter and jokes about celebrities, concluded the show.


A segment dominated by sexually explicit and graphic, largely fabricated anecdotes from the hosts and Bonnie McFarlane followed.  These fictional stories detailed encounters involving oral sex and other sexual acts in various locations (peep show booth, Broadway, Central Park, bathrooms) with a homeless man, a bald man, and Jim Norton, emphasizing Norton's aversion to dirty pants.  Bonnie then recounted a real sexual encounter with a college professor, including explicit details. Listener calls contributed to the explicit nature of the discussion. A tangent into serial killers, with specific details of their crimes and motivations, followed, with listeners adding information. A caller claiming to know Bonnie's sister added another layer. The hosts promoted upcoming shows and their appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman.


A segment heavily featuring serial killers and their crimes, with the hosts and callers recounting various stories (including a caller's near-encounter with a rapist), and details of crimes committed by Ted Bundy, Edmund Kemper, Richard Speck, Robert Pickton, and others, ensued. Discussions about the psychology of serial killers and an FBI trivia question were included. The hosts’ upcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman dominated a significant portion, focusing on anxieties, attire, and speculation about the event. A caller mentioned Jonathan Davis owning Ted Bundy's Volkswagen. A pre-recorded intro for Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane's upcoming show was played.  The hosts then prepared to leave for their Letterman meeting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Both human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What time is it?  Where are we?  It's 6-0-1 on the East Coast.  It's one minute after the hour. 
[00:01:30]  Oh my God.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  We've already done a radio show in the office and in the studio as we wait to broadcast.  Unfortunately, only three or four people heard our ranting and raving.  Our great show that we put on for ourselves.  And then the drivel we give you.  Oh, there's a bunch of things happening today.  Oh, there's a bunch of things happening today.  Corn is stopping by. 
[00:02:00]  Are they?  The band Corn is stopping by and playing.  They got the Family Values Tour happening at, is it Jones Beach or Jones?  The Family Values Tour.  Jones Beach this weekend.  They got tickets to give away to the Family Values Tour.  And the big thing was, look, man, we love Corn.  We've had him on the radio many, many times.  But we needed something a little different from them.  So we said, hey, come on, guys. 
[00:02:30]  Why don't you play for us?  A little playing.  Get in here and play, please.  So Corn is coming in to play two or three songs.  I've been excited all morning and all last night.  And now I find out this morning that they left Buffalo, New York.  We're being heard on the edge in Buffalo, New York, a fine radio station.  Hello, Buffalo.  At one in the morning.  They left Buffalo at 1 a.m. 
[00:03:00]  And there's no equipment in the studio, right, Tim?  Nothing.  Well, they have to, um, they bring their own stuff.  Oh, wow.  Let me get this straight.  You're talking.  Oh, wait, yeah, look, there's no drum kit or anything.  The drums alone take, you got to go through that whole.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Mic check on the drums.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Keep going.  All right, snare.  Bish, bish, bish, bish, bish. 
[00:03:30]  Bass drum.  Bass drum.  Boom, boom, boom.  All right, right, Tom.  Doom, doom, doom.  Oh, and it goes on for hours and hours.  What's Iraq?  What's up, Iraq?  We just got an update that corn is lost now in New Jersey.  They're in Jersey, right?  How are they in New Jersey?  That's just the update I did.  They think they're in Jersey.  Steve.  Why don't they just call and say they want to go to a hotel and sleep?  Oh, my God.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry.  They left at one, though, and they're five hours later in Jersey. 
[00:04:00]  That's pretty impressive.  That's really amazing driving.  I mean, that's a guy on Crank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's probably, like, body parts and, like, little ribbons in the bumper.  Little patent leather shoes.  Yeah.  I've just made that drive many, many, many times.  Yeah.  It takes a while.  It takes a while.  I mean, if you're rocking, you could do it in six hours, I guess.  It's more like seven, seven and a half hours. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, sorry.  That scared me.  I saw the Greyhound buzz story from last night.  I thought maybe Korn wasn't making it anywhere.  Is the whole band coming in?  I think so.  Oh, I thought there was, like, only two guys now.  They got more guys.  It's cool.  I think so, yeah.  Well, I know Monkey's coming in and, of course, Jonathan Davis.  But we got their equipment.  Well, they got their equipment, so they're going to show up with their equipment.  It's going to be a cluster F.  It's going to be like the old days when we were up in Massachusetts.  We'd have to do a show while people are, like, setting things up and making noise. 
[00:05:00]  But they're lost in Jersey.  That old gag.  Yeah.  You're not talking to newbies in the radio business.  We've heard every excuse.  They might have come down and jumped off.  You know, you jump off the New York Thruway, like, at Exit 15 or whatever.  You jump off.  And then you come off through Mawa, North Jersey, all those rotten, awful, like, you're just,  like, begging to be killed by some kind of animal in the middle of the street when you're  driving there at night.  Yeah.  Places in Jersey.  That's probably where they are.  Well, we've got a trucker on the line. 
[00:05:30]  I'm picturing way up in, like, really northwestern Jersey.  That's when we jump off the Thruway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think they took the Thruway, though.  There's a much faster way.  Steve, the trucker, what's up?  If they took 90 across, it's 420 miles from Buffalo, the exit 9th, down to, I'm sorry,  the Tappasee Bridge.  But if they took route 17, that would still only cut 15 minutes off their run.  It's going to take them at least six hours in a car. 
[00:06:00]  And obviously, it's Korn.  They're driving a bus with the equipment behind them.  And you know it's going to take them six and a half to seven hours.  It's only been five hours.  They're lying out of their ass once again.  They might have left, he said they're lying out of their ass once again, like Korn has  a reputation for lying.  We don't know that.  Those lying bastards.  And they'll get here, we'll trash them all night.  Those lying rock and rollers.  And they'll go, I know, we just left early.  We realized it was a little longer than we thought.  Yeah.  And we'll go, I'm sorry.  Oh, good.  They said they were using a six-string. 
[00:06:30]  I counted.  It was a five-string.  They are liars.  Again.  Again.  What I meant by them lying is, you've been on XM now for over two years.  So literal.  When did they appear on XM?  They want nothing to do with ONA.  That's not true, sir.  They tried to appear on XM.  And there was a technical glitch, which was beyond their control.  It was supposed to get hooked up through ISDN.  And then there was nothing anybody could do.  I made that whole thing up, sir.  You're lying again, Jimmy.  I just wanted to lie. 
[00:07:00]  All right, Steve.  Thanks for the update.  Let's all just lie today.  Why would ISDN have anything to do with them showing up?  Let's all lie.  There you go.  We're waiting for corn.  We were very excited.  I thought when I showed up around 5, 5.05, whatever, that the place would be set for a band.  Yeah.  It's going to take at least an hour to set up the equipment.  Anytime we've walked in here and another program, either midday or afternoon show or something,  has a band coming in, the equipment's already set up. 
[00:07:30]  It's already in the hallways.  Like the day before.  Days in advance.  How come with us?  They're going to be running in here.  You're going to hear cymbals falling on the floor.  That's what we're trying to do.  It's just as crazy.  Well, where's Steve?  Could you get Steve?  I'm very busy.  Get Steve to call us.  I want to know where they are.  I want to do a little GPS thing with them.  I want to see what's going on with corn.  And when do we get the blow-off?  When do we get the blow-off call? 
[00:08:00]  I'm predicting blow-off call at, they'll stretch it until 8.  8 o'clock?  8 o'clock, we get the blow-off call.  Look, guys, we really tried to make it.  Left a little late, got lost.  The guys are really tired of just checking into a hotel.  But we will, you know, make good.  I love corn.  I really do.  But we've talked to them just a bunch on the phone, and we've wanted to do something different.  Yeah.  And we even said the only way we'll have you back on the show is if you play a few songs. 
[00:08:30]  So you know how that works.  All right, we'll do that.  But then, you know, we'll make something happen where they can't play, but then they still get their phoner in.  Right.  You know, we've been at this a very long time.  So that's the first thing that's going on.  That was supposed to be the big get for the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yeah.  Although we do have Dane Cook calling in at 8.30 to promote his HBO show.  Oh, is that going to be monstrous?  Steve's on the phone.  Here's Steve.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve.  Yeah.  What do you know? 
[00:09:00]  I just got on phone with the band's tour manager.  They got lost in Jersey.  They are roughly 25 minutes away.  Wow.  25 minutes.  And then they got to unload?  As far as I know, the equipment should be there.  Is it not?  Let me look.  Do they play little small things that we can't see?  Let me turn around and let's just look at the studio here.  Do they play drums in Korn?  They are bringing a small, like, handheld drum thing with them, like hand drums, whatever that is. 
[00:09:30]  Do they have hand drums?  Isn't any drum kit hand drums?  Yes, Steve.  Unless they're bringing hand guitars and a lip trumpet.  Unless they turn into an a cappella band, we're going to need a couple things in studio.  Steve, do they play newspapers and red couches?  You just saw their equipment's here.  I know.  Where are you, by the way?  I'm across the street, Jimmy.  I'm walking over in a few minutes.  Okay.  Oh, be careful.  All right.  So they're 25 minutes away with all their equipment. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know how much equipment.  I was on the phone with their manager last night.  Don't yell it up.  I'm not yelling.  Who said I was yelling?  All right.  Go ahead.  You don't know how much equipment, but there's got to be some equipment, right?  It's some equipment.  It's a couple guitars.  It's like hand drums.  It's a keyboard.  And the stuff that goes along with that, it's not like a full-blown thing like when it ever had ever showed up.  Okay.  So bongos is pretty much what you've described.  Yes.  Bongos.  Yeah.  Hand drum bongo.  And some acoustic guitars. 
[00:10:30]  Mm-hmm.  So we're going to have to lay out like a bunch of microphones to mic everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  Yeah.  And everybody knows, the guys at 3FM know about this.  They know the band is coming and everybody should be ready.  Oh, I know.  Tim is just waiting.  Okay.  Tim's great, but, you know, he needs equipment.  All right.  And then he can start plugging things in.  All right, Steve.  Keep us updated.  I will do that.  Thank you, sir.  I will say that I happen to be the voice of reason. 
[00:11:00]  I think if they were going to blow us off, they would have, if they were lying, they would  have set up state of New York dot Jersey and they would have said, dude, we're an hour  and a half out.  We got, we got, we got an accident or we ran over a small, uh.  Just tell them we're 25 minutes out.  Yeah.  I want to know how they made the drive in five hours.  Yeah.  That's, uh, quite the trip.  That is unbelievable.  Unless they left before one o'clock.  The driver's got, grinded his teeth down into powder.  He's got a mouthful of, like, powdered milk.  The other thing, uh, we're going to be on Letterman tomorrow night, which is very, very 
[00:11:30]  exciting for us.  And, uh, we're just, we're just begging, uh, the company here, free FM to leave us alone  for a couple of days and they just will not listen to us.  Trying.  It's driving me nuts.  I've been, I've been, uh, talking to, to whoever will listen to me and they just don't get it.  No one listens.  You just go through 8 million emails every day.  See, this is probably going to be boring to some of the listeners, but, uh, when the  show ends, we do, we do five to five and a half hours of radio a day. 
[00:12:00]  We do, uh, the first three hours for a lot of commercial radio stations across America.  And then we continue on XM satellite radio for two to two and a half hours.  So by the time we're done, and I know, uh, people listening to this, they have a much  tougher lives.  I, I get that.  Yes.  I, I understand that.  And you got, you know, your jobs are, are, are, are much tougher because this is really  isn't a job.  We get it.  The world needs to ditch diggers too, you know, but all we want to do is get off the  air and just go home. 
[00:12:30]  And we can't do that.  Every day we have to do something.  All I kept saying is I want to go home.  I just want to go home one day, one day and enjoy my day, but there's always something  going on.  Yesterday we were, uh, we were being fitted for, uh, clothes for Letterman.  So we, we don't look like a holes.  So that was a nice thing.  Yeah.  But still it took time.  It took like, it took like two hours.  I just, I still wanted to go to sleep.  It took so much time that, uh, and I are thinking, screw it. 
[00:13:00]  We'll just wear, you know, something that we got in our own closets.  Can't Travis just go for me as a stand-in?  Probably.  A twig.  And then, you know, tomorrow's the big day and we want to be well rested.  We want to get off the air and maybe, you know, uh, sleep for a while.  So we're nice and fresh.  And we're not pros like Jimmy is with this, uh, whole, uh, late night talk show thing  where he jumps off a plane, runs in, looks fresh. 
[00:13:30]  He's all funny.  And he slides out.  Yeah.  Everything's nice.  On the way from the airport, they're tucking in the, the makeup thing.  Yeah.  Around your makeup in the limo.  Yes.  I just run in.  Jay, how are you?  Funny.  Plane was a little late.  Ah, we laugh.  No, I, hell no.  I want to be there a day early and I want to relax.  You want to just collect your thoughts and get your head together, man.  That's all you want to do.  Well, we have to do a pre-interview tomorrow before Letterman.  So I don't even think we get to nap tomorrow.  You know, and, and then, so today I'm like, all right, well, let's just take today and 
[00:14:00]  just mellow out.  We can't, we have a client meeting.  Yeah.  And these client meetings, I understand are very, very important for free FM here in  New York city.  I understand that to a point.  People want to come in, advertise on this program and meet with us and talk to us about  the product, Topey.  That's the purpose of the client meeting.  And, and, uh, and in most cases it's, it's a great idea because maybe it's something we  don't really know about.  So they, they educate us.  Educate.  They tell, uh, they tell us a little something about the company and what kind of message 
[00:14:30]  they want to bring across to potential customers.  Right?  Right.  We get that.  So today we have a client meeting and I call up Tom.  I'm like, Tom, can't we just reschedule?  Please.  We're freaked out about Letterman.  We've never done anything like this.  We just want to be well rested.  Right?  Right.  And he says, no, we, we, we can't reschedule because people are flying in from, uh, all  over, I guess the country.  All over the country.  We're meeting with Panasonic.  I love Panasonic.  We've been doing live reads. 
[00:15:00]  Who doesn't?  We've been doing live reads for Panasonic for a long time now.  Uh, uh, yeah.  We're meeting with them to talk about flat screen TVs.  Plasma flat screen, um, televisions by, uh, Panasonic.  But.  And I'm out of my mind because I'm like, we, we know TVs.  We know TVs.  Not only that, but for, since April, since we started.  April 26 or whatever it was. 
[00:15:30]  Here.  Right.  Every day.  We look at four Panasonic plasma televisions of various sizes all over the place.  Flat screen Panasonic plasma TVs.  They're huge.  They're huge.  Oh.  You can't miss them.  And then there's ones that would be great for the bedroom right here behind Opie.  And then there's the great, uh, home theater one that, uh, got in front of us over here.  And then in the office we have one.  We, it's not like we haven't seen them.  They are beautiful. 
[00:16:00]  We love them.  We love Panasonic.  I'm like, this doesn't make sense.  But why?  Are they going to, uh, we're going to go in there and they're going to teach us how to  turn on a TV?  Like, what are they going to teach us about plasma TVs?  Okay, guys, here's the remote.  So instead of, uh, going home right after the show and mellowing out and getting ready  for the big day tomorrow, as we do Letterman, we have to meet and look at flat screen TVs  today and walk around like zombies like we do after the show.  It's not even just that.  We get like five things to do today. 
[00:16:30]  It's, it's, it's.  Yeah, but Ann, I was trying to take care of us and get rid of one of them.  I know.  One of them.  And, uh, the obvious one that we should get rid of.  We can reschedule the meeting.  Postpone it a little bit.  We can reschedule.  Because I know they want to meet us personally and shake our hands, blah, blah, blah.  Well, they're getting the zombie look today.  That's what they get today.  And then you wonder if they tell Tom or something.  The guys didn't really seem very excited.  Because we're tired. 
[00:17:00]  About that.  And we want, and we have other things on our mind right now.  We're going nuts.  And we're working for two companies.  We got two radio shows.  Someone has to manage this better.  People are saying perhaps they want to call just opium and tell them it's not plasma.  I know.  I went over that with Anthony.  That's why Anthony does the live reads.  I'm getting there.  It's plasma.  Uh, God.  But it's just this stupid stuff that we have to deal with.  We're looking at the flat screens right now as we talk. 
[00:17:30]  I love them.  Like, what are they going to tell us?  They're beautiful.  And don't tell us they just want to meet you.  That's great.  We're too busy to be meeting people today.  Hoo-hoo.  I'll bet you there's one standard flat screen joke they're going to do.  Like the salespeople get together.  Yeah, there's like one standard.  Yeah, every little get together has like the standard joke they do.  Right.  And there's going to be one flat screen.  Ha, ha, ha.  And we'll laugh.  And the salespeople are familiar with it.  They're like good-naturedly laugh.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Don't laugh.  Turn it into a political thing.  We got to start talking about these client meetings.  We met with the soup man.  Not the actual soup man because he is too busy to meet with us.  He's much too busy.  But we have to meet with his people.  With the soup people.  They brought soup in.  It was delicious.  It was wonderful.  Great.  So instead of going home and sleeping, we're sitting around at noon.  Eating soup.  Like looking and talking like zombies, trying soup.  Go, yep, it's good soup.  It's good soup. 
[00:18:30]  Love it.  They couldn't bring it in while we were broadcasting and go,  could you try this soup real fast?  That would be a great thing to do.  It has to be a special meeting after the show that takes another hour to hour and a half  as we sit in a conference room and taste soup.  Yeah, that would be a good thing if they brought it in while we were on the air.  We eat.  Ooh.  To die for.  Good soup.  Very good.  To die for.  And the soup.  Scrumptious.  And the soup is excellent.  And I've been eating the soup man soup for many years because I live in New York.  I know all about the soup, but I still have to meet with the soup people. 
[00:19:00]  Great stuff.  Not with the soup Nazi because he's got good people around him that make sure he doesn't  have to do these stupid meetings.  But we still have to do them.  Yeah.  And then the other day, I don't even want to.  Sponsors, great.  Meetings, stupid.  I don't even want to give away the next client meeting, but we're sitting there, right?  Like, holy crap.  You've got to be kidding me.  And then the lady on the phone, because she's too busy to actually fly into New York because  she has people around her that help her out. 
[00:19:30]  So she gets to do it on a phone.  And all of a sudden, she goes, now I want to play your best live read you've done for  us.  It's like an award show.  So now nominated for best live read.  We now want to play the best one you've done so far.  Why?  That was a good one.  I think it was an example of what to continue to do in the future.  Perhaps.  I told Anthony before the show, though, it's such a it's such a crapshoot. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You know, because you read these.  I might get the acronym wrong one day.  Yeah, you read the copy and, you know, some days it's a straight read and other times  other times you might go off on a little tangent that makes it a little special.  Acronym?  Did I get that wrong the other day?  No, no, no.  You're probably right.  I'm trying to figure out what you're talking about.  Oh, what?  It was a news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  BCR.  Oh.  It's called BRC.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Three times in a row.  Stan was ready to just kick me in the side of the head and he should have. 
[00:20:30]  Here's how you remember BCR.  It's what Puerto Ricans watch videotapes on.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, that phone meeting was just like, oh, my God.  And I'm not.  My dear, sweet Jesus.  I'm not bitching so people feel sorry for us.  I'm bitching to just show you how ridiculous our lives are.  No, this is just what we do.  We just want to do our radio show and go home and rest so we give you another really good radio 
[00:21:00]  show the next day.  Stellar program the next day.  But people are just wasting our time.  Make no mistake.  I love Panasonic.  I love plasma TV.  Who wouldn't?  I love flat screen TV.  People love them.  In general.  We look at them every day.  Why?  Why?  Why do we have to look at flat screen TVs after a five and a half hour radio show today when  we all we want to do is worry about being on David Letterman tomorrow?  That's all we want to do this week is worry about one stupid thing. 
[00:21:30]  It's very important to this program and and and the people associated with this program,  our appearance on David Letterman.  So we want to concentrate on that right now.  I'm going to be in there in this meeting today.  And all I'm going to be thinking about is Letterman, Letterman, Letterman, Letterman.  And the second half of the show we do from another studio.  So so then we have to walk back over here.  Yeah, it's not a quick meeting.  That's what I want people to understand. 
[00:22:00]  They say it's going to be quick every time, but it's never quick.  No, it's not.  It's a minimum of another hour onto our day.  You bailed out on the last meeting, too.  It's the phone meeting.  Oh, yeah.  I was sitting there.  Oh, he just got up and left.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, oh, my God, I've got to just sit through the rest of this.  Oh, yeah.  Here are the calls.  Boo hoo.  You have such tough lives.  Opie, stop whining.  Hey, look, I the bottom line is this.  No one is saying that this is as hard as being a cop or a fireman or a school teacher. 
[00:22:30]  I started by saying that or a doctor or a bank dick or a bank dick or a or a truck driver or a bus driver or I just want to continue to name jobs until it got uncomfortable.  An accountant.  But the bottom line is you do have to come in and kind of talk about you have to kind of be fun and entertaining for five hours a day.  Not that that's physically difficult, but you don't want to kind of be like emotionally drained and then come in and do it.  And I'm bringing this up to show you how ridiculous it is that we have to meet after the show to look at flat screen TVs. 
[00:23:00]  That's all I'm trying to say here.  Yeah.  Like, what are they going to tell us that we need to know?  So stop at the calls or feedbacks.  We're not looking for sympathy.  We're not boo hooing.  We're not looking for such tough things.  No, absolutely not.  It's not that.  We're just showing you how ridiculous it is.  That's fine.  Well, I'll say this.  You know what?  I thought cops had a tough job.  I came in yesterday.  Uh-huh.  My coffee was cold.  Tougher job, Jimmy Norton.  Absolutely.  That's what I say.  Absolutely.  There's other things we'll be discussing soon, too, by the way. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, no.  As the honeymoon phase comes to an end.  Oh, yeah.  There's 12 emails going back and forth about just getting us a lousy car so we can show up to Letterman in style.  And something other than a 62 Rambler.  Right.  Instead of just walking up or popping out of a cab.  And then there's a big argument who's paying for it.  Ew.  Oh, yeah.  Just put them in a limo. 
[00:24:00]  Who's paying for it?  It's actually funny if you two show up on a horse and carriage like two homos.  All the fans outside cheering.  And you two get off at a horse and buggy.  Horse and buggy.  That's what I love about XM.  They don't penny pinch.  We never have these arguments.  They just pay for everything.  And that's why, you know, the company is in financial ruins.  But I wouldn't go as far as to say that.  But I've seen an increase in the stock.  They actually made a comeback.  But, man, if we ask for something, because we don't ask for things often, believe it or not. 
[00:24:30]  You know, they go, yeah, no problem.  We understand this is important to you.  I was reading emails going back and forth from Club Soda Kenny and Mark last night.  I was cracking up.  Over a stupid car.  Over a car.  So we can arrive in style for once.  In comfort more than, like, style.  I don't care what the hell the vehicle looks like.  It's not that.  I just want to be comfortable.  Dude, I said I would walk there.  They're going, oh, you can't walk there?  That's crazy.  It should be a limo because listeners here are the – a lot of the fans on Whackbag and that we're, like, figuring out how to get together. 
[00:25:00]  There's going to be listeners outside.  You should pull up in a limo.  It's a special thing.  It's a big show.  It's not that much to get you a limo.  Should me and Opie be through the top of the sunroof with our arms up in the air going, whee, perhaps, prom dates?  Oh, that would be funny.  That would be funny.  Both my tuxes.  But I know that's a very – I almost said no-brainer, but that's kind of an easy decision.  Right.  That you should be in charge of – you should have a limo. 
[00:25:30]  And when we're discussing some of these things back and forth, don't compare us to Howard Stern or Don Imus, please.  Yes.  Well, Howard never blah, blah, blah, blah.  Imus blah, blah, blah, never blah, blah, blah.  Did someone say that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Howard never, what, ask for a limo?  That's not a big request.  Well, he had his own limo driver all those years.  That's why.  Yeah.  We don't roll that way.  We don't have limos.  We don't – literally, we don't roll that way. 
[00:26:00]  We walk that way.  We cab that way.  I hop into a stupid cab every day when I finally get done with this horse S.  But there's emails going back and forth all day about a dumb car to get us to Letterman and who's paying for it.  Oh, that makes us feel real good.  And then who's paying for dinner afterwards?  That's another big issue.  Well, someone thought it would be a nice thing if maybe we went out for a nice dinner after our Letterman thing.  Yeah.  I mean, people around here are looking at this Letterman thing like it's just a thing to do. 
[00:26:30]  To us, it's like, holy crap, we're going to be on Letterman on Thursday night.  And so we wanted to do maybe a little dinner afterwards to celebrate, you know, kind of take a look at what we just accomplished and have some bread and some pasta.  You know what would be really funny is if you made sure that the intro said, ladies and gentlemen, you can hear your next two on XM Satellite Radio, and that's all he mentions.  Whoever pays.  Whoever pays for dinner. 
[00:27:00]  Whoever pays for dinner gets the big plug.  I'll buy you dinner.  You can see them all on Jim Norton's MySpace.  Yeah, we're taking bids.  Who gets the plugs?  Well, Free FM pretty much passed on paying for dinner.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking asses.  Thank you.  Thanks for making us feel special.  It's not in the budget.  Thank you.  We're not doing Donnie Deutsch, you asses.  It's Letterman.  It's a dinner.  Wow.  I mean, we're not taking the entire studio audience there to eat with us. 
[00:27:30]  But that was an argument going back and forth.  Well, well, I must never blah, blah, blah.  And Howard never blah, blah, blah.  Well, we never had to pay for this in the past.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Well, so I guess, I don't know.  Also not paying us $18 million.  Yeah, exactly.  I got to be honest.  I don't know what Howard Nymus got, but this is a pretty low-maintenance show as far as things like that.  As far as everything.  How low-maintenance can a show be when the show is over, all we want to do is leave? 
[00:28:00]  This is so low-maintenance.  We're out of your hair.  We just want to get out of here.  Oof.  But I got CC'd on all those emails, and it was driving me nuts.  I know.  I was reading them and laughing.  It's like a way to make us feel, you know, feel, you know, I don't know.  Slash old, whatever.  The Kenny Chernoff emails, it turned into a comedy.  I felt like I was reading something out of The Onion.  It was just that funny. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  That they're going back and forth.  Oh, yeah.  A little bidding war on dinner.  Kenny, who's paying for dinner?  Kenny.  XM Satellite Radio.  Are they?  Are they really?  And is it true if I'm passed on that?  Yes.  CBS said no to dinner, so XM stepped up to the plate.  I don't know how high up that went.  I'm going to be actually out of town, unfortunately, because I'm really annoyed I can't go to this.  But I understand they're actually paying for my dinner on the road and some listeners who are showing up to Letterman. 
[00:29:00]  I just made that up completely.  Of course you did, you liar.  All right, well.  How about this?  Is there a limo company out there that would like to provide a really nice stretch limousine?  I don't get any plugs.  I'll walk to the effing gig.  Not begging.  I'm not taking a limo or anything now.  I'll walk to the effing gig.  You know what?  And I'd like to know how high up this went, because I bet our good friend Joel Hollander knows nothing about this dinner thing.  I bet he would be happy to foot the bill for dinner. 
[00:29:30]  What are you laughing out there?  E-Rock's laughing.  Watch it all started with Joel and the email he sent saying, tell those two to eat out of a dog dish.  I have bills to pay.  They better wake up.  There's still one more ex-Van Halen singer out there that could hire.  Yes, Kenny?  Yes, your mic.  The mic has to be on.  As far as paying for things goes, we're still in a struggle about other things also.  I know.  I know.  We're just touching the surface.  Trust me. 
[00:30:00]  How about a little appreciation?  To us, being on David Letterman tomorrow night is a massive deal.  It is the biggest thing we'll probably do in our careers.  I don't care about appreciation as much as just, it's just common courtesy.  I think it's just something you should do regardless.  They're looking at this like it's a bar gig for us.  Yeah.  We're not canceling any of your client meetings.  We're not canceling the interviews you got to do for this publication that 12 effing suits will read someday in between banging whores. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, they do that.  They're not canceling anything.  I'm like, please, we just need to breathe and rest.  This is a big deal to us.  But no, today we'll be sitting with a smile on our face looking at flat screen TVs.  Wonderful.  Wow.  Wow.  A flat screen TV in this day and age.  Amazing. 
[00:31:00]  I'm actually going to ask him today in the meeting how you turn it on.  Are you going to do that?  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to be sarcastic?  Oh, yeah, I will.  Are they going to have a DVD thing that puts something on that shows the colors and stuff?  Too bad you don't have like a blank one with gay porn on it that you two can say, we have to watch this.  Oh, would that be good?  Yeah.  No, this is the one you have to watch.  Look at the colors right here.  Well, it's kind of clear and viscous-y.  It's just hardcore.  But look at the way that it's white.  But look at the way the mustache has now died after it hits it. 
[00:31:30]  It's a complete uncomfortable room.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's take a break.  Do we have an update on corn?  Will something go right today?  Will something go right?  Wait, wait, Dan.  What?  Dan?  Kenny's got the corn update.  They're filing in as we speak.  Oh.  They're here?  Yeah.  630.  They've got to tell the truth.  Never would have thought.  Yeah.  They're in the green room.  Yeah.  People are coming up.  They're being escorted in.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  You can take a break and see for yourself.  Because seeing is believing.  Good point, Ken.  Wow.  Good point.  That's a good one.  Bob Soto-Kennie, take us a break, will you?  Break that down.  We'll be right back, folks.  Stay tuned for this.  No.  Yeah.  For this.  What is it, 1961?  And what is it, the mobile oil comedy special?  That was awful.  We'll be right back with the handsome and talented show.  No.  Oh, the Opie and Anthony show?  And the virus thing.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  And the virus is spreading.  Stay tuned.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  Apparently not.  Apparently not.  It's a hair conditioner.  Jesus, I don't want to smoke near you.  That's the driest hair I've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  Is that dry?  I don't use gel.  I don't believe in it.  And you're like 6'6".  It is.  You're too close to those lights above you, man.  I don't believe in gel.  What do you use?  Sandpaper?  God, Kenny.  I use shampoo and conditioner all in one.  Yeah, the purse.  The first time.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:00]  Tweeter Center tickets, by the way, $10 lawn seats are on sale now.  Oh, that's right.  For September the 9th, our show in Camden on sale now, $10 lawn seats.  That's what really pushed the Jersey show to the roof.  Yeah, lawn seats.  Jersey show.  What an awful plug.  Yeah, YSP's been promoting the hell out of it, so thank you to everyone at WYSP in Philly.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America, right, Kenny?  Yes, sir.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[00:33:30]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:34:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show, the ONA virus.  It's spreading across America.  Corn is in house.  Or in da house.  Is that how you say it?  I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  They're loading equipment into the studio as we speak.  We're very excited.  They're going to play two or three songs for us today.  Hurricane Ernesto.  After days of coverage.  After it being on the front page of many papers.  Yeah.  Especially down there in Florida.  What did it do?  It did nothing.  Did it wreck anything?  It did nothing.  I didn't see any news people standing out in the wind and rain hanging onto a tree. 
[00:35:00]  It was yelling into a microphone.  So I guess it was nothing.  It was a bus like Paris Hilton's latest CD.  Oh, hey.  Or her first CD, I guess.  It was a Spanish hurricane.  That's why it didn't work.  Oh, thank you, Rich Voss.  Ernesto turns into Florida dud.  So after all that great coverage we got the last few days, it's on page 26 of the paper today.  That's it.  26, buried.  I mean, buried.  It was like an underwear ad on the same page. 
[00:35:30]  You know, the first track of that storm I saw when it was just, it wasn't even up to Cuba yet.  It showed the track going directly toward New Orleans.  Because that's what they wanted to happen.  That is the ideal circumstance.  No matter what people tell you or the news, it's like, oh, worst case scenario, they mean best case scenario.  Was that something slip?  They are hoping a hurricane hits New Orleans again this year. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, they'll never tell you that.  They won't.  But believe me.  But behind closed doors.  The vultures are just waiting, hoping.  Well, you need the sequel.  Right.  You want to watch the levees break all over again.  So we got to acknowledge West Palm Beach today.  You guys did all right.  Batten down the hatches, did they?  They did all right.  Yeah, they were kind of on the outskirts of that whole thing.  Well, the track had it going sort of their way.  Did you board up your windows?  What do they do, E-Rock? 
[00:36:30]  Board up the windows?  Oh, no, E-Rock's going to be...  Well, E-Rock's the expert.  Yes, E-Rock.  They have hurricane shutters.  They just pull them down.  Oh.  I see people with plywood and nails.  Those are businesses.  Houses have the shutters.  Don't get all testy with that.  Yeah, I didn't like that snotty...  The tone of voice is very angry.  When I talk, I do more damage than that hurricane.  All the spit that comes out of my mouth.  Oh.  I like the way you explained it at the end.  Yeah.  The spit that comes out of my mouth.  I didn't get it.  That was good. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  We got Rich and Bonnie in studio as well.  Hey, speaking of weather, you want to do the local forecast today?  For everybody?  Yeah.  Remember this guy that does this thing?  Uh-huh.  So, you know, because a lot of the people that write about the Opie and Anthony show, they  like to talk about how, you know, they're not local.  Syndicating into a city takes away the local flavor.  Blah, blah, blah.  They could be talking about something in New York.  Blah, blah, blah.  Meanwhile, we're not getting our weather report. 
[00:37:30]  Or our traffic report.  Oh, boy.  So, we do local forecast for everybody.  Back by popular demand, it's Opie and Anthony's local forecast minutes.  That's what we do today.  For this whip them out Wednesday.  For the people in Chicago who aren't listening to man cow anymore, it's like whip it out Wednesday  for heterosexuals.  August 30th, 2006.  What's the skinny?

[00:39:00]  Hope you're enjoying your mid-morning break from...  Extreme Rock Radio.  Mostly sunny.  Highs in the middle of the morning.  I quit.  I quit this bitch.  Nice.  They gave them a little extra push.  Yeah, you know what sucks about the weather bit?  We're adding so many radio stations, it's getting faster and faster.  Yeah, I can barely understand what the hell he's saying.  All right, let's say hi to somebody in Cleveland.  Somebody, what's up?  What are you doing with the stupid weather bit?  What do you mean?  What's your name first?  Mike. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, Mike.  Not a fan of the weather bit?  Mike, raining on our parade.  It's the most annoying 30 seconds of the radio.  What are you talking about?  Come on.  It is annoying, I'll give you that.  But at least it keeps us local.  Yeah, we need to be local to succeed.  Didn't you hear your city?  Didn't you hear your city?  I don't care if I heard my city.  See, that's the point.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't get the bit guy.  It's supposed to be really stupid.  It is really stupid. 
[00:40:00]  You're don't get the bit guy for the day, sir.  Thank you.  Now someone's going to call up saying they don't like the don't get the bit guy bit.  Because our listeners are buffoons.  Mike's a little dope.  Speaking of Vegas, why don't we go to Vegas?  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Rich, Bonnie, everybody else.  Hey, I thought, since you guys just got on the air on regular radio, here in the future. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Because you guys aren't on until 10 o'clock here.  Okay.  I thought I would explain to the people in the future the whole wow bit.  But, Jerry, your in-the-future bit doesn't work because by the time they hear this, they're going to just think you're doing it at that moment.  Right.  No, I'm doing it in the past.  They'll think you're cheating.  This is like a time capsule.  I like the concept, but it's not going to work.  Because now there's Joe Schmo.  He's driving around in Vegas. 
[00:41:00]  And they hear you call the Opie and Anthony show and talk about how you're going to explain wow in the future.  But it's in the present because they're hearing it for the first time.  Rich's head's going to explode.  You mean when he's driving around and it's sunny and 108?  Huh?  You mean when he's driving around and it's sunny and 108 here in Las Vegas?  Look, let me tell you.  It's sunny.  Look.  It's sunny.  And it's 102 degrees today.  Wow.  It'll probably be hotter than that.  It's a freaking desert.  Probably.  It's here. 
[00:41:30]  It's now.  It's 102.  It's whatever it is right now.  Try to buy a bank.  It's 102.  Try to buy a bank.  Actually, it's 91 right now.  All right.  What do you got, Jerry?  Screw the future bit.  It's not going to work.  Okay.  Okay.  I hate the future bit guy.  Yeah, because we want to make believe people are hearing us live.  That's right.  Oh.  See, we're live right now in San Francisco.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Um, would you like me to explain wow?  Huh?  Would you like me to explain wow?  And I will prove that we're live in San Francisco. 
[00:42:00]  Give us a call if you're listening to us right now in San Francisco.  Yep.  There you go.  All right, Jerry, go ahead.  Okay.  The wow.  Whip them out Wednesday.  What you do is you either rent the boys, send them a self-addressed stamped envelope, and  they'll send you a wow sticker, or eventually the station here will get wow stickers that  are unique to this station.  You put them on the vehicle, or if you can't get a sticker, you make one of your own. 
[00:42:30]  Put the wow on your vehicle, and then you wait, and you wait, and eventually you'll be driving  along, and you'll look over, and some lovely lady will be showing you her loveliness, and  then what you do is you give her a little wave.  Hey, thanks, honey.  You're bound to be incompetent.  The guy is giving, you are giving the worst, the worst example of what wow is about. 
[00:43:00]  All right, Jerry.  Can you crash me, or would you like to crash me now?  No.  I wish we just never took your car.  Yeah.  This is how Bud Dwyer sounded right before the bullet.  Oh.  It is whip them out Wednesday.  You get a wow bumper sticker.  If you can't get a wow bumper sticker, you get a homemade wow sign.  You throw it on the car when you're driving around, and you're almost guaranteed to see  a lady flash you, okay?  Right.  We focus on it on Wednesdays, but it's happening all the time now.  Matter of fact, at the One Traveling Virus at the PNC Arts Center, nothing but wowing 
[00:43:30]  going on in the parking lot before the show.  This thing has been working.  I was a little drunk.  Well, thank you, Bonnie.  It was wonderful, though.  And it's been working great for us for many, many years.  So just throw a wow in your car and see what happens.  But there are ladies out there that will see the wow, and they will flash you.  Absolutely.  All right.  I think, speaking of the virus, maybe we should take 30 seconds out to talk about how well  I emceed the show and performed walking the parade and then going up and doing my time. 
[00:44:00]  I thought it went very well.  What do you guys think?  Wow.  Well, I mean, you know, I walk in, you know, you would think if I, you know, I was Bobby  or somebody would say, hey, great show or great time, but not even, you know, anything,  nothing.  When you do your job, you don't get kudos for it.  Well, I mean, when you work such a venue like that with so much energy and so much, you  know.  Speaking of so much energy.  Wow, boss.  Well, I'm just saying.  Have we told you in the past that even though we're talking, like when this mic shuts off, 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  I could fall down on this floor and go to sleep.  Yeah.  But while we're talking into the mic, how about a little bit of like, oh, here's Rich.  Here's Rich.  Why hasn't anybody talked about how good I was?  Okay.  Well, I don't want to see it.  You got to sell it.  Okay.  We could, we could be sleeping right now.  Anthony's absolutely right.  In a second.  If I laid my head down.  We sound like we're wide awake.  Okay.  That's what the people want to hear. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Not Mosco.  Weren't you rewarded enough that night?  Yeah, that night was cool.  Yeah.  That was, that was great.  Even.  You excited?  Huh?  Oh, you know what?  See, that's the problem.  You know what the problem is?  You guys.  Tell me what the problem is.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  All right.  Jekyll and Hyde.  You're going to tell me something.  Let's go.  Let's go.  You know, when you're there.  Let me hear what you got to say.  When you're there and all.  See, the problem is.  There you go.  Now you're awake.  Here's the problem.  You got to come in Monday after those shows when everybody's talking about everybody's pumped 
[00:45:30]  up still.  Right.  That's the thing.  Right.  Because Wednesday, everybody's like, oh, okay, well, we already talked about it.  Yeah, we talked about it.  Yeah, we're moving forward.  We're all about the Philly show.  The Philly show.  With the long seats on sale for $10.  All the info's up on opianthony.com.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay, so that's my problem is not calling in or coming in on a Monday right after the  show.  It's not your problem.  It's my problem.  Well, we gave you kudos on Monday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, thanks.  Talked about how we, remember?  Opie said something about it.  No.  Rich came out. 
[00:46:00]  No.  Jimmy, do you remember what I said?  We talked about the whole thing.  About Rich, though.  Oh, you said, um, um, maybe it wasn't.  I, uh, could have sworn you did.  Backstage when he was on, you came over to me and you went, he's good.  First of all, when you go on stage in front of that many people opening the show and breaking  them in, okay, it's a little bit tougher.  And I just want to say they were a great crowd.  That's all I'm saying. 
[00:46:30]  Okay, and I'm doing this.  Rounded them up.  Got them all ready.  It was a lottery.  Very good.  You do have a hard job when you, when you emcee that kind of show.  You did great.  Yes.  Thank you, Bonnie.  You know what else you have a hard time doing, apparently?  Finding blueberries that aren't bitter.  Whoever bought these, I'm going to mush them in your face.  That's what I want to say.  You're a fancy, important man.  Awful.  These are awful.  I like fresh, sweet, juicy blueberries.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  I was just noticing that ant was right.  Bongos. 
[00:47:00]  Nice.  Yes.  Corn setting up in studio.  All right, we're going to take another break.  We're a little late, so we got a break already.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip  Em Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of Wow Stickers and 2x4s.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  Opie and Anthony! 
[00:47:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on this morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Corn is setting up.  They're going to do a couple songs for us today.  People wondering if Stephen Carr is going to jam with them.  I think Steve would love that opportunity.  Of course.  But it ain't going to happen.  Speaking of cars.  Oh, nice segue. 
[00:48:00]  Boulder DA.  Update on John Carr mistake.  We were watching some of this before the show today.  They got the wrong guy.  We said it right off the bat that that creep couldn't have done it.  The Boulder DA, didn't she come out and go like,  well, we have a lot of investigating to do.  She seemed like she knew something loose.  Like they had to test this idiot, but...  Yeah, like why couldn't they just bring a swab back?  I agree.  But, yeah, she's getting some emails.  Apparently a couple.  Oof.  Just saying that she should resign and she really screwed this one up. 
[00:48:30]  And that she should be...  Well, should we just play it?  Yeah, let's hear the clip.  We found this kind of humorous.  That people are still using this old gag.  This old term.  These have been a very difficult few days for all of us, and I'm sure you can imagine that.  Last night as I was preparing to leave, I received a telephone call from a gentleman in Longmont.  And he said... 
[00:49:00]  This was a voicemail.  He said you should be tarred and feathered and run out of town.  And I want you to call me and tell me that you're going to read something.  Tarred, feathered, and run out of town.  Wow.  With villagers with pitchforks and torches.  You write of that in 1880?  You should be burned at the stakes.  We're kicking it 1500 style.  Tart and feathered.  You should be forced to lay with a Negro.  You might have.  But she says it all almost like she's breaking up and there's a tear in her eye. 
[00:49:30]  Tarred and feathered.  You can't take that crap seriously.  No one gets tarred and feathered anymore.  You know what the problem with tarred and feathering is?  I don't think anyone ever got tarred and feathered.  How about that?  Oh, they did.  They did, but you know what the problem is?  It didn't happen, because this is the argument I had with Anthony.  You never get to the feathering part.  No.  The problem is we know of tarred and feathering through cartoons.  That's it.  And it looks very fun when it happens.  Oh, you varmint! 
[00:50:00]  You know, you throw a little keg of tar on them and feathers it.  And they usually wind up looking just like a chicken.  But the actual tar and feathering is very painful, I would have to imagine.  Very hot.  And they would burn their skin away with the hot tar as they flung it on them.  And yeah, like Hope said, I doubt they ever really got to the feathering portion.  Would you die from it?  Oh, yeah.  You'd die from it.  Or you'd just be left, you know, completely screwed up.  No, you're not living through a tar and feathering. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it's like...  It's screwed up from the, like, the burn or...  Yeah, the burns on it.  Humiliation.  Humiliation, yeah.  Like feelings with very hurt.  Yeah, it's hot tar.  They're not throwing asphalt at you.  Yeah, it's molten tar.  And where do you get tar these days to tar and feather somebody?  Eh, sanitation.  Yeah, it seems like they could trace it back pretty easily, though.  Yeah, by when they fill in a pothole, you throw a handful at somebody.  CSI would have an easy time with that case, though.  Tracing down the tar, where the tar came from. 
[00:51:00]  They'd have it all figured out.  But why feathers after, like, all right, we just scalded off his skin down to the bone.  What else you got in there?  A pillow?  Feathers?  Yeah.  Could have been anything.  Tar and oatmeal, if there was a cask of oatmeal close by.  I think he didn't have copies of Honcho Magazine.  That's what it would have been called.  Tar and Honcho.  Because you've got to bring the silliness into it.  Yeah, that's what it was.  It's like, all right, he's burning.  This is great.  He's dying.  They were all about fun back then with their torture.  Head on a pike, things like that.  Which head on a pike? 
[00:51:30]  Well, they cut their head off and then, you know, stick it on a big pike in front of the city wall.  Very funny.  You know, hysterical.  And it's one of those things, like, you kill the guy, you cut his head off, but that's not good enough.  You've got to give the people a show.  That's what they want to see, a head on a pike.  The greatest one I ever saw was the hungry rat in a cage on your belly.  That was a good one.  Oh, we went through that torture chamber museum thing.  Where was that?  Was it that stupid spooky world?  Was it part of spooky world?  Spooky world.  Because this was, like, real stuff. 
[00:52:00]  You were there, right?  Yeah.  In one of the torture devices.  I saw it at a Renaissance Festival once, but then I guess I saw it again at a...  Maybe it was a Renaissance Festival or something?  Universal Studios?  I don't know, but they used to get, like, hungry rats, throw them in cages with the bottom  out of the cage, and then they'd lay it on your belly.  They did that...  And they would just eat away your guts.  Yeah, they do it to your head, too.  They did it with the guy's face in the movie, 1984.  Yeah.  You know, and they put, like, peanut butter or something on your face, and the rat just  nibbles away.  Yeah, they just let the rat run around and eat your face. 
[00:52:30]  On your belly?  That doesn't mean...  They would just put the thing on your belly, and he would just nibble at your belly?  And he would eat through you.  Rats wouldn't just nibble.  They would start with a little...  They'd eat a hole right into you.  They would start with a little nibbling, and then they would realize there's some tasty  treats that might be had.  Some of the ancient tortures where...  Remember some of the axes that they showed that were used on, like, they would hang you  upside down by your ankles and really spread your legs apart, and then use this device  to sever you in two.  From that end, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Not from the head down.  A device that had to be swung by hand?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they would throw feathers on you.  Yeah, to make you look silly.  Because at the end of a horrific death, you always needed to look silly.  Comic relief.  Yeah.  Thanks for the show, ladies and gentlemen.  So they wouldn't take, like, a guillotine, which is an automatic, like, done.  They would split you in half through your groin with your legs spread upside down by hand.  Yeah, with, like, this big battle axe-looking thing. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, that must have hurt.  How horrid.  That's awful.  Then there was another one where it was a giant cone, metal cone.  Yeah, what was the cone again?  And they would slowly lower you down as you had big, heavy weights on your shoulder.  And they would make sure that the tip of the cone went somewhere that it could go, if you know  what I mean, and then they'd slowly lower you down.  But this cone spread out to about three feet wide.  And then you'd start working for Giuliani. 
[00:54:00]  And because you have so much weight on you, it would just keep going and going until you  pretty much just broke apart.  Oh, my God.  And this is all without anesthesia?  Yeah.  And then, again, feathers, because you had to look silly.  Feather guy.  It was like, we're Taylor.  Yeah.  We're Taylor.  Oh, feathers.  Feathers.  Getting back to that funnel thing, it must have taken forever to kill the gay guys.  Yeah, all of a sudden the guy's sitting there.  Where'd the cone go?  I don't know. 
[00:54:30]  We're going to need a bigger cone.  Right.  Is that all you got?  Three cones, he'll never come back up.  All right.  Where's the sprinkles?  Can't stay alive with three cones.  I want to know who had to clean the cone when that was done.  The cone cleaner, of course.  The royal cone cleaner.  Give him a little steam shine with his breath.  Too good.  You want more audio from the Boulder DA here?  Yeah, let's hear her. 
[00:55:00]  Two different officers took DNA off of the bicycle that he rode back.  Bicycle?  What?  On a separate occasion.  Is that seatless?  I know.  He obtained a cup that he used to drink from and a tissue or wipe that he used to wipe his hands.  The bottom line is that after we did that, our expert, and we put a great deal of respect in our expert from the Denver lab,  said that the sample in the underwear of the victim was a mixed sample, and that we do not want to compare a mixed sample with a mixed sample. 
[00:55:30]  We need a pristine sample.  That means a buckle swab.  A buckle swab can only be taken by consent or by court proceeding or court order.  We couldn't get his consent because he didn't know he was under investigation, and we couldn't alert him at that time.  Just grab any of his students in Thailand and shake him. 
[00:56:00]  They're explaining why they brought him back.  Because I don't think the public DA did anything wrong on this one.  What were they going to do?  They had to bring him back.  It was one flight.  I mean, he's had to.  He got the miles, too, from that flick.  Did he?  They had to bring him back.  She even said, you can see she knew.  She's like, well, we have a lot of work to be done.  She never claimed it was over.  She kind of knew, I think, that this is a problem.  And it's funny, the papers are now calling him a liar.  Like, we thought you were a child killer. 
[00:56:30]  You're worse.  You're a liar.  You're a liar.  I think he's a cad.  They ought to throw feathers on him, make him look silly before they ship him off to California.  I think they should do that funnel thing on him.  The funnel.  Something tells me he might not.  All right.  Where can you go see that stuff?  That funnel, I can't get over that.  Yeah.  We were somewhere.  I don't remember, but these were real torture devices.  Torture museum, yeah.  From back in the day. 
[00:57:00]  They had racks on there.  And they were horrific.  And again, I can't even remember half the stuff.  I've been watching so many cartoons where they had, like, torture devices as part of the cartoon.  Like, remember the rack?  Yeah.  Was always used.  And they just show you, and then they let the whatever it is out of the rack, and his arms would be real long, and his legs, like Tom and Jerry.  And then the next scene, he's fine again.  Yeah.  And that's, like, everybody's version of it is what you learned in cartoons.  But they showed these racks that were, like, big cylinders with spikes on them. 
[00:57:30]  And they'd lay you over the top of this and then stretch you over that.  So it's not even like you're being pulled level.  You're being pulled so your back is being broken as spikes are going into your back.  And feather guy.  No one's great.  Someone had to come up with these.  Yeah.  They had a testament in a lab.  They were twisted people back then, man.  And it was all mostly about, like, the Spanish Inquisition and all about, like, religion and getting people to fess up that, you know, you loved Jesus before we snap you back. 
[00:58:00]  Now you get to just go to sleep.  Yeah.  Go to sleep.  Inject you with something.  Kenny, he's just gazing off at what a fine job that would have been.  Oh, he'd have been perfect.  You'd have been a great executioner.  When do I swing the axe?  Can we, like, dress you up as an executioner one day?  I was daydreaming.  Yeah, he was.  Those were the days, my friend.  We thought they'd never end.  Good old-fashioned tuning up.  Tuning up.  Real old school.  Yeah.  Look, he's all happy, remembering. 
[00:58:30]  We got to get a hood on him.  Dress him up like an executioner for one day.  Leather face.  All right.  Really fast, because we got corn.  They're about to play.  I guess they'll do that the next break.  Two-year-old girl gets a new leg after her dad runs over it with lawnmower.  Oh, boy.  It's been a hairy leg.  I'm going to play this, and you got to tell me why we're playing this today.  Oh, really?  Hopefully, you'll find the humor like some of the staff did. 
[00:59:00]  Okay.  It's the second clip officially, though, right?  First two.  Oh, first two?  End of the first two.  All right.  So, remember, two-year-old girl gets new leg after her dad runs over it with lawnmower.  Mm-hmm.  Listen to the clip.  Okay.  Very closely.  Isabel Norton's life is about to change again.  In May, the two-year-old lost her left leg after her father accidentally ran over her  with their lawnmower at their Springfield home.  Doctors say had the blade cut an inch higher on her leg, she would have bled to death. 
[00:59:30]  Very emotional.  Very tough for dad.  Isabel's father, Kirk, can laugh again because things are about to get better for the family.  I'm excited to see her walk again on her own to run, to play a little easier because  it's kind of awkward for her playing with her siblings.  We're going to go ahead and fit the prosthesis on her.  It's not finished.  Oh.  What the hell was...  Please.  What was with the saw sound?  That was constructing the leg. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, making the leg?  That is a little morbid.  Damn, why...  Was she right there?  As they're using stars?  Yes.  Using a lawnmower.  Portland's Shriners Hospital for Children is paying for Isabel's prosthetic leg until  she turns 21.  Doctors say the fact she's only two years old should make learning to use her new leg easy.  If we get a properly fitting prosthesis, then yeah, she should be able to do everything,  well, most everything that she did before. 
[01:00:30]  How is that?  Do-do-do.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, boy.  That is so cool.  Isabel's dad knows nothing can bring her real leg back.  But he says considering what happened, this is the next best thing for her and for him.  She still, you know, she loves me like she normally did, if not more.  However, everything's just, I guess it's normal to me right now.  Everything's back to normal.  Yeah.  She loves me as though I didn't run over her leg.  Oh. 
[01:01:00]  How many years before that starts coming out in arguments?  Yeah.  I want to use the car.  Well, you can't.  I have one leg.  Here's the keys.  Take it away.  You are drunk mowing the lawn.  Do you remember that?  For 19 years, she's got to use that little baby leg until she's 21 today.  You don't think they're going to give her a different one if she grows?  Yeah, I know.  It's bad enough with like baby clothes, isn't it?  Don't they grow out of it in like a month?  She's going to look ridiculous.  It's like she's got a dangling thing.  Tipping over.  She's going to walk in and people are going to go, did your father run over your foot with a warm arm? 
[01:01:30]  You're the girl, right?  But they're going to have to change it every like couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks.  How do they do that?  I guess she was in the grass.  How do you miss that?  You're haphazardly mowing your lawn is what you're doing.  You're not looking after your kids.  People are awful with their kids.  They just don't look after them enough.  It's just dumb luck that any of them make it to the ocean like the baby turtles.  Oh, thanks.  I'd like to bring that up.  It's a great analogy.  All right.  Let's go to Eli in Massachusetts.  Eli. 
[01:02:00]  Ellie.  Eli.  You.  Guy from Massachusetts.  Did your father run over your tongue with a lawnmower?  Pear torture device.  The pear.  What's that?  I heard about that.  All right.  Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse, real fast.  We've got to take a break here.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How are you guys doing today?  I just got to call out Voss for looking for sympathy for nobody going up to him and saying  he did a good job.  Rich, you remember me from the spring in Woodbridge?  From where?  Excuse me.  From where?  From Woodbridge, the spring store.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  What's happening?  Yeah, I came right up to you five minutes after the show when you were selling your DVD,  which I've already bought.  So I guess you didn't want to give me a...  Well, am I supposed to remember everything?  Oh, thank you.  But I'm not going to...  You didn't say who you were.  I'm not going to remember everybody.  There was 11,000 people there.  Was I rude?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, can I address the people that say, hey, you remember...  Hey, dude, you remember outside the store?  And you're like, what the...  What?  Well, dude, Rich wasn't saying that. 
[01:03:00]  This guy thinks that Rich said nobody came up and congratulated him.  Rich wasn't groveling like that.  Rich was groveling because he felt that he wasn't properly praised on the radio show.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he was still being the same ass you think he was, but in a different context.  Well, the problem Jesse's having here, Voss didn't remember him, but this guy, I guess,  has given Voss many free cell phones.  Oh, no.  He hooked me up.  Oh.  So that's why this guy's a little pissed off.  Like, oh, my God, you don't remember me?  I've been giving you free cell phones for many years. 
[01:03:30]  Is that right, Jesse?  Oh, is that the guy that...  I didn't give him many, but I gave him one, and then I had my buddy hook him up.  Yeah, he did hook me up.  You did hook him up.  Now, I went in there, and I gave you some DVDs, and I got you in.  Listen, if you're...  Here's the deal.  If you're...  Listen, Jesse...  I can't clap on you 100%.  Jesse, if you're...  Don't hang up on you 100%.  Jesse, if you're in...  I can't shit on you 100%.  If you're in Fort Lauderdale this week, I'll get you into the improv for free.  All right.  Okay.  Very good.  Hey, Jesse, before you...  I have a question for you, a real question.  Sure.  On my phone bill, on my cell phone bill, in New York, is your cell phone considered 
[01:04:00]  a utility?  No, it shouldn't be.  You should only be charged in New York taxes.  Oh, they give you taxes on everything.  No, no, but I have government surcharges on my phone bill, 11 bucks a month.  Yeah, FCC charges.  Right.  But then there's another one for my phone company in their own surcharges.  On a cell phone?  Yeah.  I think that's Verizon does that.  What's that mean?  I have no clue.  I don't work for Verizon.  Are they allowed to do that?  Is that legal?  Of course they are.  I can do whatever they want. 
[01:04:30]  And I'll shoot Voss an email.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you, Jesse.  Good talking to you.  You're going to get Verizon arrested, mister.  The guy reminds me of...  Because he said, you know, remember that I don't like being tested either by you people.  So no testing.  Anytime someone tries to test me, whenever we're out doing something, someone will come up  and go, hey, Anthony, what's up?  And I'll go, hey, how you doing?  You don't remember me, do you?  And then you try to go like, yeah, I kind of...  Because I don't want to be like, no. 
[01:05:00]  You go, yeah, I kind of...  No, you don't remember.  Now, from now on, warning everybody.  No more testing.  I'm just going to go, no, I don't know you, remember you, or care about you.  But that's not nice.  Kenny found it humorous.  But that's not nice, though.  It's not nice, but it's not nice for them to do either.  I know it is.  I meet a lot of people.  It's kind of annoying.  It's like, hey, Anthony, what's up?  And you go, hey, how you doing?  And then you go, you don't remember me.  No, I don't.  Eli.  Thanks for pointing it out.  Eli.  Yeah, what's going on? 
[01:05:30]  Let's go.  Just another torture device.  I don't know if you guys remember this one.  They had a pear-shaped object that would spread out into any orifice in your body.  Oh, right.  It had like a little crank on it.  What?  Like a screw on it.  And you'd turn this crank and it would open up.  No, you tell it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Eli.  I saw it.  I was going to explain it in a way a professional broadcaster would.  But no.  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Explain it, Eli.  No, I was just going to say that I saw all these and maximum.  That's it. 
[01:06:00]  See?  Again, he didn't explain it.  He didn't do anything.  I was trying to explain it, and you had nothing.  All right.  So it's a pear-sh.  Oh, well, whatever.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just continue.  No reason for Anthony to talk.  Who cares?  He's called the opium guy on the bad cell phone show.  So go ahead, sir.  You explain.  You're doing such a stellar job.  Why would we want to hear it from a man who actually has, you know, broadcasting skills  that would be crisp and clear?  Go ahead.  This cast iron.  How exactly did it work, sir?  Cast iron thing.  Well, whatever.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, sir.  I was going to try it again. 
[01:06:30]  You guys are just getting me so confused.  I'm going to punch out you guys, sir.  How did the pear thing work, bro?  How does it work?  Go ahead.  Explain to the people.  Oh, I got a picture of it here.  That looks really un...  Oh, bagels.  It looks almost like a...  I heard.  A Swiss army knife that's been...  It's closed up with that length.  There's a little skull on it.  Apparently, it goes into anywhere, which would be your mouth.  You're not...  Wow.  And there's, of course, a sharp point on the one end.  Yeah.  And as you screw the screw in, the pear-shaped bulbous end spreads apart. 
[01:07:00]  So, wherever you put this would be very uncomfortable after a few turns of the screw.  Am I right, Eli?  Yes, you are.  Yeah, thanks.  Great.  I think Patrice has one of these in his suitcase that he brings in.  You know, there's one torch you might not have heard of where they lay you on the ground  and your father starts a lawnmower.  You have to walk around on a little leg.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in Queens.  Mike.  Yo, here it is.  Mondo Moron.  Rich Watts. 
[01:07:30]  Listen as this lispy-lipped cerebral sedative stutters and spittles his way through lines  as he brings the show to a screaming hall.  I've had a bad...  I've already had...  Mondo Foss.  We like when the listeners come up with Mondo Topless nicknames for everybody.  So, there you go.  There is one from Mike.  Very good, Mike.  All right, man.  Terrific.  Hey, real fast.  Ant, I have no idea about this, but you brought it to everyone's attention today,  the 10-10 wins thing.  Oh, yeah.  There seems to be a little bit of tragedy in Giuliani's old administration. 
[01:08:00]  There's a guy...  I guess it was his press secretary.  Oh, my God.  We're talking about the ex-mayor of New York.  They're not going to find this interesting in Chicago.  He's America's mayor after 9-11.  America's mayor.  Or...  Or...  Buffalo.  New London.  Or Dallas this weekend at the improv.  Providence doesn't give a crap.  Do you think no one knows who Giuliani is?  They don't care.  It's not local enough for that. 
[01:08:30]  America's mayor.  Monkey!  What up?  You know?  All right.  We'll get to you in a minute there.  They're getting ready to play, Korn.  Yeah.  We can't wait.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Apparently, somebody in his administration was a gay gentleman.  Just fine and dandy.  Hey, whatever you're into.  Right.  There you go.  San Francisco.  And the gentleman was found...  You kept it local.  I kept it local.  He was found murdered.  Well, they think it might have been murdered.  They think it might have been some rough sex play, something going on. 
[01:09:00]  In his bedroom...  I love the Asians.  Yes.  There you go.  Just keep it local.  San Fran.  All right.  In his bedroom.  He was completely nude.  They found him kind of wedged between the bed and the wall.  There was a condom next to the bed.  And some KY.  Dude, you told this story yesterday.  We know Richard's dead.  No, it's...  It wasn't my old pal.  Get a wow sticker over his mouth, bro.  We heard the tree fork story yesterday. 
[01:09:30]  I'm not telling it again.  We're talking about the ex-mayor of New York.  This is brandy new.  Has nothing to do with Richard.  And do you actually have the audio?  Yeah, we got the audio.  Oh, okay.  And I just thought it was odd.  I don't think they mentioned the condom and the KY in this story.  They do.  Than, thank you.  But, yeah, because I was like, well, they're leaving some details out.  But it's just the way they described the crime that left a little bit of...  Left a little to the imagination. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Give it a little listen.  You can pick it up.  You found a chuckle in this.  Hopefully it's a better chuckle than the last story,  which I thought was going to be over-the-top great with saw sound effects.  And we had maybe a half a second of a saw.  Eh.  Wasted a lot of time on that piece of crap story.  Now her leg.  The potential suspect in the murder of former Giuliani Deputy Press Secretary Martin Barreto  was picked up on 30th Street near Lexington Avenue.  A brief chase leaving a police officer with an injured leg.  Detectives at the 6th Precinct questioning the man, 
[01:10:30]  described only as a person of interest in the Barreto killing.  And the 48-year-old PR executive found strangled last Monday in his Greenwich Village apartment.  His larynx crushed.  His naked body wedged between the bed and the wall.  Now police believe Barreto knew his killer.  There was no sign of forced entry.  Al Jones, 10-10 wins at the 6th Precinct in the West Village.  Ah!  Look, could they have used different terminology, perhaps?  There's no sign of a break-in. 
[01:11:00]  Break-in.  No sign of...  Ah!  He knew his attacker.  Ah!  It seems he let him in.  Ah!  Ah!  Even that.  Okay.  It seems he was familiar with his attacker.  Ah!  No breaking and entering.  No.  Well, they said that the other story I heard said it appeared that the back door had just  been kicked in.  Oh, is that it?  Right.  They thought it was a hit and run.  Forced entry, yeah.  I think that was one of those kinky things, man. 
[01:11:30]  Just this guy who loved to be dominated.  That's what it sounds like, you know.  Between the bed and the guy just crushed his larynx by mistake.  Then ran.  Yeah.  Some guy polluted.  And the cops found him and confirmed it by sniffing.  But he was the PR secretary.  I mean, I don't think his nationality is relevant.  I don't know why they had to mention that.  Oh, public relations, I believe, is also a term that's PR.  Swing and a miss.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Yeah.  We have Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Hopefully, we'll explain that through a promo or something because we don't have time today. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, promo.  I thought you were still going off the same story.  No.  Sorry.  Don't forget lawn seats for the Camden show for the ONA traveling virus down there in  the Philly area.  Yes.  $10 through Labor Day.  And it's our show there September the 9th.  We have, was it, nine or ten comics?  Just buy your tickets and go.  All right, all the info is up on opianathony.com, but the headline today, lawn seats are only  $10, okay?  When we get back, Korn in studio, and they'll play at least two, maybe three songs for us.  Jonathan Davis and Monkey next. 
[01:12:30]  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker, visit opianathony.com.  Wow stands for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, Whip Him Out whenever.  It's going to be Whip Him Out anytime, but that's a wow.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  Wow.  One of these days you'll be driving, a girl that's familiar with the program's going to  see the wow, know what it means, pull up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better. 
[01:13:00]  So there you have it.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Show.  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  Where are you guys going to be?  Fort Lauderdale?  Fort Lauderdale Improv this week.  Starting what, tomorrow?  Thursday, yeah.  Thursday through Sunday.  Very good.  Very good.  All right. 
[01:13:30]  We got Korn in studio as well.  We got Family Values.  It has hit town.  It's going to be at Jones Beach September 2nd.  What day is September 2nd?  That would be Saturday.  How did you figure that out?  Because we're on Letterman the 31st, which is Thursday.  And then I had to do a little math.  I told you I was good at math yesterday.  Well, that's not really math.  Jesus.  Family Values, of course.  Long formula.  You got Korn, the Deftones, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, and Deadsy. 
[01:14:00]  And we got 100 pairs of tickets to give away on the walkover to XM today.  We did this one other time.  It went very, very well.  We're going to do it again.  It's a mob scene.  Right around, I don't know, 9 o'clock, right outside this building, 57th Street between  6th and 5th Avenue, I guess.  You'll see the crowd gathering.  We're going to be walking and broadcasting on XM and throwing Korn tickets to everybody  that shows up.  Nice.  Okay?  Where are the guys?  And what do I have to do over here, Tim?  I got to turn up some other pots. 
[01:14:30]  Why would Tim be here?  Why would we know?  We'll just wait.  You have to press a button?  I just gave the big intro.  I noticed my headphone volume got real low.  Yeah.  Probably for our own safety.  Anyone else notice what I just did there?  The big intro.  And then you go, here's Jonathan Davis and Monkey from Korn.  And then, you know, there's enough people in the studio to clap and then they feel like 
[01:15:00]  they're wanted.  We do a little chit-chat and then they rock for us.  But instead, I don't know what, mic to turn on.  Hey, Jonathan.  There you go.  We know how to turn that one on.  Is that one on?  Oh, there you go.  What's up?  I got to be honest.  We didn't think you were going to make it today.  Nothing against you or anybody else.  We just heard that you guys left Buffalo at one in the morning.  I've made that drive many times because I went to school up there and did radio up there.  So I'm like, that's like six, seven hour ride easy. 
[01:15:30]  It was.  But our bus driver hauled ass and I actually got off stage.  I got literally, last note, ran from stage, got on the bus, came here.  Wow.  That's nice.  Police escort, everything was nice.  Oh, really?  You got the police escort?  Yeah, I had to get out of there.  And the tour was great last night in Buffalo?  Yeah, it was amazing.  In Buffalo, Family Values Tour in Buffalo last night.  Yeah, it was good during late.  And you just run off the stage.  Did you do the fake thing like you're coming back for one more song so you can beat the traffic out? 
[01:16:00]  The band can't do that.  The band can't miss the encore.  No, you guys.  I thought you meant like, because what I used to do sometimes, if I wasn't like totally into the band,  I would leave before like the last song to get out of the parking lot.  The band really can't do that.  No, you missed it though.  There's a whole thing that goes on with these guys.  I mean, bands in general.  Oh, I got you.  And I've been doing radio long enough, and one day I'm sitting in the audience going,  wait a minute. 
[01:16:30]  They've already done three encores.  Why are the lights still out?  Yeah.  And they make you believe that they might be coming out for one more.  Everyone starts doing it.  And everyone's clapping.  And then all of a sudden, the lights go on, and everyone starts booing.  And I'm like, why did they do that?  And then it finally hit me.  To get out of there.  To let the band beat the traffic out of the venue.  That's the only reason they do it.  That's messed up.  You guys.  Missed up.  We hang out after.  It's all good. 
[01:17:00]  No, yeah.  You guys have always been great to the fans.  I'm looking around trying to get a mic for Monkey there.  Steve's working.  I want to rip on him.  Could you guys share a mic?  I mean, these guys are married.  You want to sit on the couch?  These guys are married.  Why did you throw that in there just for the hell of it?  Because they could share a mic or they could share DNA and everything else.  It was almost like you said.  It's like, don't try to make any moves on Bonnie.  Well, that's what I was getting at.  That's okay.  They're famous.  Check one, two. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, there you go.  More dog in the house.  We go way back with you guys.  We just did film that dumb Real Rock TV show up in Boston.  I remember that.  You guys were just starting out and you were doing beach parties and all that for us when we were at WAF.  Oh, yeah.  And we used to film skits backstage and stuff.  We've done lots of stuff.  God damn.  I'm going to bring those videos in soon and throw them up on YouTube.  Don't.  Yes, I'm going.  Please don't.  That's the worst, man. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to be scared to pop my name into YouTube.  Nah, YouTube.  You guys check out YouTube?  Yeah, I do all the time.  Do you ever find some video of you that you're like, wow, who took this?  Where did that come from?  If I want to go back and see stuff from years and years ago, there's always so much stuff on YouTube.  Way back early.  Where the hell did they get it?  Kids are just videotaping.  We hosted.  We were the hosts for the XFL pregame show for NBC.  It lasted like four weeks.  It was a complete disaster. 
[01:18:30]  It was fun.  The league was a disaster.  Our pregame show was a disaster.  But on YouTube, some kid brought a video to one of our tapings and just has me screwing up my lines.  I'm like, what?  Some outtakes from that?  Yeah.  But it wasn't from NBC.  It was just some kid with a camcorder.  Wow.  That was, I don't know.  I just find the YouTube very, very interesting.  Yeah, everything will end up on that one.  There's a video, actually, of me coming out of a bar in Hollywood, just completely hammered. 
[01:19:00]  It's hilarious.  TMZ, that company that does that stuff.  I think it's TMZ, whatever.  But it's on there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's funny.  It's so funny.  Do you remember being hammered and leaving this club?  No.  No, man.  You're just like, I was there.  You were drunk.  Yeah.  I came out of this club in Hollywood and I was talking to these two girls.  I was like, hey, you guys want to go back to my hotel?  And they're like, oh, yeah, yeah.  And then Kimberly Stewart pulls up in her car and she's like, come on, jump in my car.  Next thing I know, I'm at the Stewart's house and this dog's like staring at me in the morning. 
[01:19:30]  You were at Rod's house?  Yeah.  Was he there?  No.  Uh-oh.  All right.  That's as far as I'll go.  And that won't end up on YouTube, right?  It's there, I think.  Oh, real?  It might be.  Probably not all the gory details, right?  No, no, no.  That, by the way, the important part of that story was the difference between a comic and  a rock star is where you said to the two girls, you want to go back to my hotel?  And they said yes. 
[01:20:00]  With a comic, can we bring our husbands?  Yeah.  Our boyfriends would love to meet you.  I met you, by the way.  You probably don't remember me.  I met you with Craig Gass in Stand Up New York.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I just saw Craig in Sacramento.  He was doing a show over there.  And I don't think he got to see the show because he had a show of his own, so he did  Run.  Yeah, he's always on the road somewhere.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  That was a nice blow-off.  He just gave me, but he's a very polite dude.  He's like, yeah, no, Craig's good.  You just did what I told everyone I hate. 
[01:20:30]  You remember me?  We were just talking about that.  Oh, Jimmy.  I remember this club here in the city.  Yeah, that's what you do.  Yeah, that thing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no, I knew he would because he's Craig's friend.  Yeah, I met him at Woodstock when I hosted Woodstock, but I didn't bring that up.  I heard them talk about that in the dressing room, actually.  Look at the dummy.  For a half a second, his eyes lit up.  Oh, they did?  All right, we got to say hi to Steve the Trucker because we started this show talking about you  guys, and we're like, there's no way they're going to make it.  And then we got a call that you were lost in Jersey, and then Steve the Trucker, you 
[01:21:00]  know, these guys know the highways.  Steve, what do you got?  Well, I called to apologize to the boys from Korn and to Opie and Anthony, and I was wrong.  They made it with a police escort.  I knew that.  No, no, a police escort out of Buffalo.  Not the whole way down.  Why don't you tell Jonathan and Monkey what you called them?  I called them liars.  They called you not only liars, they called you, he called you rock and roll liars.  Wow.  That's harsh.  The worst kind. 
[01:21:30]  Now I called to apologize, and I called to beg for tickets.  Because we found out that you, they found out that you were lost in Jersey, and he's  a trucker.  He's like, you don't go through Jersey if you're going from Buffalo to New York City.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But you can do that, by the way.  You've got to do that because the buses.  I don't drive.  All right, Steve.  I called to beg for tickets.  All right, won't you have one?  Yeah, you called and you did.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Matt, what's up?  What's going on, boys? 
[01:22:00]  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I just had to quickly call and ask.  I've been a fan of you guys ever since you first started, and you know, having so many  great albums out.  I just wanted to know, do you guys have a favorite song that you guys love to play live  after all of these years?  I think, I still really like to play Blind, believe it or not, after the 10,000th time  or something like that.  Still a lot of fun to play.  I'd go with that one, too.  That's the big one.  That's the song that we added for us. 
[01:22:30]  You know, going to one of your shows, Blind's probably the best song to see live.  You know, when you guys come up on stage and the place just goes nuts.  So only play that like 10 times a night.  Perfect.  Everyone's happy.  It makes it easy.  Just do a very long version of it.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  I used to hate that with the one-hit wonder bands when they, like, extend their hit.  Forever?  Yeah.  It would just, like, go on for hours. 
[01:23:00]  Guitar solo and then a drum solo.  My brother, Elmo, tells a story.  He went to Spring Break back in the 80s there, and Modern English was the featured band.  Man, Jesus.  Oh, man.  And they had I'll Melt With You, right?  Man, yeah.  They played it to open the show to get everyone psyched.  They played it in the middle of the show when they weren't digging the other crap from the album.  And then they did it as the encore.  They actually got away with playing it three times.  Three times?  I picture A-Ha doing that with Take On Me.  Yeah, but A-Ha is huge in Europe, we learned. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, of course they are.  Who isn't?  All right.  We're going to, like, uh...  Hasselhoff.  Hasselhoff is huge.  Yeah.  Germany.  Germany.  Yeah.  Only Germany.  They'll love them.  What year did you guys tour with Ozzy, by the way?  Because I saw you, like...  We toured with them in 94.  It was actually us, the Deftones, and Ozzy.  Actually, Ozzy was...  He gave us our first gold record.  Him and Sharon, while we were on stage, they set up a big trough of champagne and beer.  When we came off stage, Ozzy and Sharon presented us with our first gold record. 
[01:24:00]  It was pretty cool.  Oh, nice.  That is very, very cool.  Let's say hi to Shrub in Pennsylvania.  Shrub.  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Just wanted to say what's up to Korn.  I fucking love them.  All right, well...  I messed up.  It's all right.  You want to say you love Korn.  That's good.  Thank you.  You got a question?  They were the first concert I ever...  Ever what?  Oh, my God.  What an awful call. 
[01:24:30]  I wish I could figure out what he was going to say.  Shrub, you still there?  Best concert I ever...  Best concert you ever what?  Probably saw.  I think he said first.  Went to.  Oh, all right.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hello.  Hey, Matt.  Killed his date, Ed.  What's up?  Hey, quick question.  I've been a big fan.  I had your first album when it came out, but, you know, since your recent departure of  your guitarist, how is that going to affect your live set?  Actually, it's improved it. 
[01:25:00]  It's made it way better.  I love that.  No, because for a...  No, because I know it's the music, specifically what you have.  You know, you need two guitars and one bass.  Now you have one guitar and one bass.  Can that affect the quality?  Actually, we have a cat, Rob Patterson, and some other backing vocals and keyboards that  you'll be quite surprised at how good it sounds.  It's the eight piece on stage now.  All right, wonderful.  I'm checking you guys out Friday.  I got tickets, eighth row.  All right.  All right, cool.  And if you don't have tickets for the show this Saturday, we're giving them outside the 
[01:25:30]  building at nine o'clock today, a hundred pairs of tickets.  We did this last time after, I guess, we talked to you on the phone, Jonathan, and  it was a mob scene.  It was a mob scene.  Like dummies who stood on the corner with like just handfuls of tickets, and it was  just, it was really awful.  And we noticed we were giving away corn tickets on the corner, and we tried not to do hacky  radio bits, but we were in the middle of the hacky radio bits.  They were like, hey, we're on the corner giving away corn tickets.  Corn on the corner.  Ugh, shut up. 
[01:26:00]  All right, let's go to Matt in Atlanta.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  What's happening?  Hey.  What's up?  I just wanted to share, this is my one cool rock and roll story.  In 1995, I guess it was the first time you guys went on tour with Deftones and Orange  Nine Millimeter.  Oh, remember Orange Nine Millimeter?  Oh, yeah, they're a great band.  They're still around?  I don't think so.  Was that Deftones?  I think it was Sick of It All.  Yeah, something like that.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Some buddies of mine that were in a band that never made it, this was in Raleigh, North Carolina,  they said, hey, come out with us tonight. 
[01:26:30]  It's five bucks, three bands, you can't go wrong.  And that was probably one of the best, you know, grungy bar or rock and roll shows I've  ever seen.  The next morning, I went out and bought three new CDs and been a fan ever since.  Yeah, I actually kind of remember that.  Was the stage kind of propped in the corner?  Yeah, it was a place called The Brewery.  Yeah, I remember this place.  North Carolina State University campus.  Yeah, this place is dirty.  It's bad.  But great show.  I remember it like it was yesterday, and I've seen it several times since. 
[01:27:00]  Do you miss playing the small clubs?  No.  No.  Not at all, right?  Really?  It's fun sometimes, you know, get intimate crowd, but we like them.  Not the dirty, nasty bars.  No.  The ones that had, we literally walked in one, and there was chicken wire and bikers, and  we said bye.  Actually, we played a lawnmower repair shop once.  That was the best place we ever played.  It was a tin roof shed.  We asked where we go to the bathroom, because we had to go take a crap, and they go out 
[01:27:30]  back in the woods.  Here's what I'm going to do for it.  Oh, wow.  I swear.  That was actually in Augusta, Georgia.  Augusta, Georgia.  It was a lawnmower repair shop.  How'd you get that gig?  Did you see a two-year-old girl's leg in there?  Yeah.  How'd you get that gig, though?  That was back in the early days, obviously.  That's when we had a really killer booking agent.  Yeah.  It's like, and he has to call you and give you the good news?  All right, guys, I got you a gig.  Like, we had no clue.  We just showed up, and we went, why are we going into the forest or wilderness?  And we just kept going and going, and we pulled up, and we just saw this little shed. 
[01:28:00]  That was the gig.  I love the gigs where you just know it's a waste of time.  You got to play it.  And the floor was dirt, too.  It was crazy.  How many people?  I don't know.  A hundred?  A hundred and so.  Yeah.  It's not bad for a shed.  Straight out of delivery.  You know, it's like.  Those people will never forget it.  No.  Shrub is back.  Shrub?  Yo.  Hey.  Phone cracked out.  I'm a truck driver.  I'm in Georgia.  All right.  Speaking of Georgia.  I just was calling to say that the first show I ever saw was Korn, the first concert 
[01:28:30]  I ever went to, and Jonathan came out in a floor-and-line black trench.  He just looked badass.  Oh, right on.  Thank you.  And I had a little story.  You have two people that came in to watch a performance, Jarrett and Mandy.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  I had a little story about Jarrett.  He used to masturbate into a sock, right?  And this sock got so hard that you could stand up on that.  He could beat somebody with it.  I think you might want to ask him about that.  Awesome.  Okay.  I'll do that next time I see him. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  Thanks.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  You going to show Saturday, Jones Beach?  I'm working.  I can't.  All right.  I got screwed.  I read somewhere that your new guitarist, Rob Patterson, from OTEP, you guys don't actually  let him play on the stage with him.  He plays off to the side or behind the curtain.  Yeah, we spit on him and we beat him.  What the hell is that, man? 
[01:29:30]  Because we're mean.  No, he's on stage with us now.  Well, I saw pictures.  He was kind of off to the side, like behind the curtain.  That's when we had to nail his pedal board down because he tried to keep kicking it out  to work his way out on stage.  Trying to get some spotlight.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  They've got to earn their keep before they can get out on stage. 
[01:30:00]  God's sake.  You've got to earn it.  Yeah.  He earned it.  Steve.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Jonathan Monkey, huge fan.  Love you guys.  I've got to tell anybody who hasn't seen a corn show.  Amazing.  You've got to see it.  The energy is fantastic.  There's nothing like it in the whole world.  As soon as they come out, it just gets lit on fire.  They get the whole crowd jumping.  Sick, dude.  It's totally sick.  Yo, I'm a limo driver.  I'm on Long Island.  I can't wait for Saturday at Jones Beach.  Yo, let me ask you a question.  We've got these tickets off StubHub off the Long Island. 
[01:30:30]  We pay like $140.  Does that piss you guys off?  Because we love you, man.  But we just want to sit close.  We've got to do what we've got to do to get these tickets.  Does that drive you guys nuts?  Is that like bootlegging?  I mean, there's so many people.  You know, scalping kind of.  Scalping kind of, yeah.  The people buy up the tickets, and then when the show sells out,  then they start selling them for crazy prices.  Yeah, I mean.  There's nothing we can really do about it.  Of course they think it sucks.  I think any performer thinks that sucks.  We don't like ripping our fans off,  and that's what we did at $9.99, taking it out on the lawn. 
[01:31:00]  It's just so everyone can afford it.  Yeah, well, I can't wait to see you guys,  and we just do what we've got to do to sit close  because we're at a point in our lives where we like to really enjoy stuff.  You know, a little older now, but.  Well, thank you for doing it, bro.  Rock on, guys.  All right.  Thanks for doing your thing, man.  Thanks, man.  Steve, they're going to play a couple songs here in our studio.  I guess we need to take another break so you can do a sound check?  Yeah, we can check it out and see what it sounds like.  And then decide if you want a lot of people to hear it.  And then I'll go to my hotel and go to bed. 
[01:31:30]  That works.  Pack it up.  All right, we've got Corn and Studio Family Values Tour this Saturday at Jones Beach.  Tickets still available,  but we've got like 100 pairs of tickets we're giving away right after the show today  at 9 o'clock outside this building, 57th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue.  There's going to be some people.  And actually, you're going to do the walk with us and everything today before you go  back to bed?  I'll put some shoes on.  All right.  I'll have some coffee.  They're going to show up.  It's just a couple of blocks.  A couple of blocks.  It's a pretty easy walk.  You can get your corn tickets from the guys themselves.  That's cool.  How's that sound?  57th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue right around 9 o'clock today. 
[01:32:00]  And we promise we won't do it on a corner and get all hacky with you, all right?  The hacky radio bit.  All right.  When we get back, these guys play live.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:32:30]  O&A uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, we're back with The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Very busy show today.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie in the studio.  We got Korn in the studio getting ready to play.  Ding Cook is calling us in like 15 or 20 minutes.  Lots to do.

Don't know.  Nope.  Don't hear it. 
[01:33:30]  I hear an echoey mic.  Is that good?  Hello.  There you go.  I can hear it.  I can hear it.  You can't hear yourself?  We can hear you.  It's a...  Someone needs to turn my headphones up.  Yeah.  Like way up.  Like way up.  Oh, you're like me.  You're deaf.  I like it.  Check.  Has it blown your ears out?  Hello.  He can't hear you.  I guess that's a yes.  I'll take that as a yes.  Check.  Hey. 
[01:34:00]  How's that sound?  Now I sound like I'm in a big room.  How did Kenny fix it?  Why is it echoey?  What did Kenny do?  It had to be something that worked.  I threatened to hit it.  Cool.  All right.  Hey, how's the new CD doing, by the way?  We haven't even talked about See You on the Other Side.  It's doing really good, man.  It's doing all right?  Yeah.  And the single is Politics?  That's our next single, yes.  Right on.  All right.  That was just me stalling.  Was that stalling? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, so you guys could get all set and nice.  Because I know the CD's doing well.  I wouldn't ask that.  Actually, it sucks.  It's doing as bad as Paris Hilton's CD.  She's finished.  All right.  Are you guys ready, you think?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  The big intro.  It's Korn.  We got Jonathan Davis in studio and Monkey and the rest of the guys.

Eat you if you let it.  And as the tears fall on, you'll dress, you'll dress, the wind is coming through.  You're in a mess, a lonely life.

Yeah, but it's Jonathan 
[01:44:30]  You know, it's not like  You're trying to, you know  Name him after a couch  Or something  His first name should be  Jonathan Davis  Yeah, she wouldn't go for  Monkey, so  She wouldn't go  See, that's the joke  Damn it  That was the joke  It wasn't like  You were naming it  After Monkey  Alright  No, no  I really did  I named my son  After Jonathan Davis  And she's like  If I find out  This is after  The guy in corn  But I just  I just like the name  Your wife sounds lovely  Yeah

[01:49:00]  Dane  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Dane  What's up, man?  We got a busy day  We just had Korn in here  Playing live  Oh, killer  Yeah, definitely  Congratulations on  Banging Jessica  I'm so glad you're  Finally admitting it  To everybody  Which one?  Why aren't you  Admitting it?  There's nothing to admit, man  Even if you were married  With five kids  You should just say  Yep, you're right  For the sake of the call  Sure, she's right here 
[01:49:30]  Next to me  There you go  Are you premiering  The special day  It's Norton  I mean, I was up there  I watched it be shot  The first of the two shows, man  And it was really impressive  We were all there  And unbelievable  Yeah, Jimmy was talking about  How it was filmed  And everything  We were just amazed  By the whole thing  Yeah, man  It was surreal  To be out there  And I always dreamed  About doing a show  In the round like that  But it doesn't really  Obviously hit you  Until you're fucking  Standing in the middle 
[01:50:00]  Of 18,000 people  Going  Alright, okay  Now I'm here  And how is this  Going to work?  You know  Is it possible  To really  Whip this sucker  Into high gear?  And of course  With the screens up there  And just the way  The show was put together  I'm surprised  That we turned it over  Like we did  And did two 18,000s  Within, you know  An hour  Getting 18,000 out  Can you stop bragging  Please?  You're making us  All feel like losers  The sounds you just heard 
[01:50:30]  Were me and Vaughn  Shooting ourselves  I know, but come on, man  Stop bragging  It's like  It's one of those  Braggadocious  We're just busting on you  I mean  Because we watched  That happen  We're like  Alright  It's 18 plus people  And they're going to  Turn the whole room around  And do a second show  With 18 plus  More people  I know, it's stupid  He had the biggest  And this, believe me  As a comedian  I know Dan for a long time  And it's like  You're happy to see  Somebody you know  Succeeding  And you also want  To murder him  Because when you see  He pre-sold 
[01:51:00]  18,000 tickets  It was the fastest  Pre-sale  In the history  Of the venue  You know what's sad  That I haven't sold  That many in two years  In two years  Oh, that is rough  And they were showing  Clips of the special  Before like  On HBO  I was watching  They were showing  Like a little piece  Of the special  And you're seeing  Dane on stage  And you see the people  Behind  And you're right  Dude, in the round  Was something  That was just  Really amazing  And it just looks right  Did you ask for that director 
[01:51:30]  Or did they kind of  Pair you guys up  Yeah, Marty Kulner  Actually directed  I saw a special  About five or six years ago  That Carlin did  In like  77  In the round  In front of like  3,000 people  And Marty Kulner  Had directed that  So I wanted to meet  With him  And I knew he'd  He was kind of  Into my stuff  And blah blah blah  And once I talked  About it  And told him  What I wanted to do  He was like  Yeah, fuck yeah  I definitely want  To do it  So we were talking  About that  For months in advance  If we could even 
[01:52:00]  Make that happen  And of course  He did  Hey Dane  What were you thinking  I mean  You're in front of  18,000 people  In the round  Yeah  Just you and a stool  What was going  Through your mind  When you hit that stage  Here's  This was really funny  Man  All day long  People kept asking me  Are you nervous  Are you nervous  And I wasn't nervous  At all  I was not nervous  I was completely  You know  Prepared  I felt like  I felt like  I knew  You know  I knew my set  I knew  What I needed to do  I've been doing  These big shows  On the tourgasm tour 
[01:52:30]  So I was kind of  Prepped for  For the larger venues  And doing it like that  So I get to the venue  I'm still not nervous  I hear them call my name  I walk out through the crowd  I'm excited  I'm not nervous  I hit the stage  Nothing  Just you know  Really prepared  I'm in the zone  I get off  We do the next show  Feel great about it  The night ends  The next morning  I wake up to go down  I was going to go down  To Florida  I'm getting ready  To get on the plane  I'm packing  The next day  I fucking get nervous 
[01:53:00]  The next day  After this  As I'm packing  The feeling in my stomach  That usually you get  Like right before  It hits me  And I kind of  Thought about it  At that point  It was like  Holy shit  Like I got scared  I got really scared  The next morning  But I was like  It's done man  It's in the can  So you got scared  The next day  They're dumping out  A little bit  Because we're on  Regular radio too  Dane  Just to let you know  Okay got it  Dude that picture  There's a picture of you  I don't know  What building is this from  Because you guys  Have seen this in LA  Driving with a Welsh  It's like what is it  A 30 story building 
[01:53:30]  That you're on  It's Sunset Boulevard  Right  Near Tower Records  There  Yeah yeah  It's up on Sunset  HBO has a building  That they basically  It's like you know  25 stories  And they always put  Their shows up there  So they told me  You know what  We're gonna put you up  On the big building  I know exactly where  Please tell me  You're doing this  Please tell me  You're on a convertible  And you have a  Different chick every day  And you're pointing at that  Building  And then pointing at your  Lap and saying  Get to work  Now that's  That's what closed the  Deal with Jessica Simpson  I do  I do randomly drive 
[01:54:00]  By there  Where there's like  A little  There's a little  Coffee shop  Like right at the base  I just accidentally  End up there with people  And they're also  They're looking up  Going holy crap  What is that  Oh yeah that's my  That's my face  22 bucks  And you just  Point at them  Like that  Like the  The way the poster looks  You just point at people  And go hey  Yeah and then I  And then I bring them  Up into the building  And we sit in my eye  Dr. Evil  Hey we can relate  We can relate  With Dane Cook today  Because Rich Voss  Brought in one of  Our advertisements 
[01:54:30]  It fit in his  Back pocket I think  Yeah  What was that thing again  I stole it from the  Parkway or the  Turnpike toll booth  Great  And they didn't even  Yell at me when I  Took it  I parked my car  I got out  And they go  Take the other one  Yeah there it is  There it is  Wow that's just like  Being on the side  Of a 25 story building  It looks like  Kiss Alive 2  Opened up when it  Was an album form  Right  That's how big it is  It was a turnpike ad  And Dane's needs  A helicopter to install it  And we have 
[01:55:00]  Laminants inside of  Urinals from the  Parkway rest areas  Hey Dane  How much time  Didn't you do like  A lot of time  On these specials  Like over an hour  Or something  Hour and a half  The first show  I did an hour and a half  And the second show  Just  I was just kind of  On a tear  And I think it ended up  Being like 2 hours and 35  Wow  So the specials  A buck 90  And then I'm going to put  All the other stuff  On the DVD  Wait how long is the special?  An hour and a half  Oh no you said 90  I'm thinking almost 2 hours  Wow man  And that's Monday night  On HBO  That's it 
[01:55:30]  I can't wait for people to see  I finally sat down  With a bunch of people  And watched the  Completely edited  And high def version of it  And I'm really proud of it  And I really think that  As far as  Even if you hate my comedy  If you watch it  It's just  It's incredible to watch  You could sit there  And go  Ugh  He sucks  But this looks cool  Dude no one's going to think  I watched it  And it was really  One thing I was impressed with too  Is like when you walked out  It was  You had the big screens  Up on the top  And then just the circular  Stage 
[01:56:00]  But there was really  Nothing else  It was just  Dane just came out  I mean there was nothing  To spice it up  It was just him on the stage  Which I was like  That's what I was getting at  What balls  To just go out there  With a stool  In front of 18,000 people  In the round  Oh yeah  I mean trust me  There was times  When I'm like  Maybe I should bring  Like a t-shirt shooter gun  Or something  Anything  Any distraction  It's not a bad idea  A fire hose  Just randomly spray  People like Jovi  I don't know man  Yeah there was definitely  Certain times  Where I was like  You know  Am I backing into  Something awful here 
[01:56:30]  But look  It went great  And people are going to  Finally be able to see  Something that I've  I've driven towards  For 16 years  I'm psyched  Wow  By the way  I love the fact  I know that when you  When you did tourgasm  I remember Bobby Kelly  Told me before you guys  Went out that you were doing it  And I know you tried  To sell it  I think it was  To Comedy Central  Or whatever  And they're like  No  And I'm just so happy  That it obviously  Was very successful  And it just makes me  Really happy  That some dumbbell  Said no to it first  Good  Yeah yeah  We did  We brought it  To Comedy Central  And they were like 
[01:57:00]  We got this thing  With comedians of comedy  Or whatever  That we're looking at  And I had  Yeah I had no clue  That HBO  Was going to pick it up  But when they finally did  It was like  Yeah suckers  Yeah  We loved Bobby Kelly  On tourgasm  See we call him Bobby over here  You call him Robert  Bobby  Robert Bobby Kelly  And how stupid are we  To put Bobby in quotes  When people started  Pointing that out after  It was like  Yeah we get it  Bobby's  Right  It's short for Robert  I know  You give him too much respect  With the name Robert though  I know  I know  But you know  That's Bobby 
[01:57:30]  That's Bobby right there  He's Robert Kelly  My favorite part of tourgasm  Was when you went  Back to your old high school there  Yeah  Yeah  That episode 8  That was  That was pretty cool  To go back there  And revisit  You know  To stand on that stage  Man  I mean it's just bizarre guys  I gotta tell you  Sometimes it's like  The whole thing  I'm just  I'm thinking  I'm gonna wake up  And still be asleep  On my desk  In 10th grade  And it's just gonna  All be an awful  Awful  Ruling on yourself  I think I'm gonna  Wake up the same thing  And see Jim Norton 
[01:58:00]  With that many people  To see him  How depressing it is  To watch one of your friends  Have 18,000 people there  Twice  Twice  Twice  In one night  Dan if you're in  Fort Lauderdale this weekend  I can get you a guest spot  At Dan Provo  I'll be there  If you wanna stop in  Let's go man  If I can come in  I get a new 7  That I'm working on  You're MySpace  Peeling in  It's September the 4th  Was it Labor Day night?  Uh yeah  Yeah Monday  Labor Day night  Monday 9 o'clock  On HBO  Which is a great time  And it's uh  You can also  Obviously your MySpace  MySpace.com  Slash Dane Cook 
[01:58:30]  I think there's actually  Four people in the country  That aren't on your friends list  So if any of you four  Are listening  He's got over a million  Friends on MySpace  And his budding movie career  What's MySpace?  After you do 18,000 people  Like are you gonna  Like where do you go to?  Are you gonna try to do  Like a stadium  Or something after that?  My next show  Um  Cause I really want  Everybody to hate me  Is uh  From space  I'm doing it live  From space  Hey  Speaking of MySpace  There's no way  You can keep up  With that anymore  And uh  Instead of a building 
[01:59:00]  We're doing a uh  Crop circle  Over time  Do you answer  Every single email  Individually?  He used to  There's no way  You can anymore  No  He has like  15,000 pages  Of friends or whatever  It was really  Yeah  Oh yeah  The MySpace thing  Is just bananas  I mean  Who knew?  How does it feel  That every comic now  Like that you have  All those  That huge list of friends  And every comedian  Saw that  And go  Well Dane was really  Great with marketing himself  So every jackass  Like myself  Jumped out  Well maybe we'll have  A million friends  So you know  Languishing 
[01:59:30]  You're like 425  I'm telling my sister  Tell your friends  To MySpace  Things got more friends  Than Gandhi had  In the movie  I like some of these  Some of these comics  That were like  You know  Hit it in like the 80s  Or calling me  Going dude  Can you like  Can you post me  On your  Can you link me?  Yeah make me a friend  And put me on your top 8  Give me a shout out  It's like  Oh no  Some guy you had  The middle for  In like 92  That started the late 80s  And all he's headlining  Because it was a comedy boom  And then he just kind of  Squeezed with a bottleneck  Yeah I get them too 
[02:00:00]  And I'm still like  Opening for them  Dane where do you go  From here?  Another comedy tour  Hopefully after Vicious  I'm going to wrap up  This flick I'm doing  And then I'm looking  To put that together  And who knows  Maybe Tourgasm 2  If I can figure it out  Don't you get sick  Of it sometimes?  Who's that?  All the tour  It's Bonnie  It's Bonnie  What's up?  The better half  Of Boss and Bonnie  What's up?  Jesus  Do I get sick of what?  Touring all the time  I haven't done it 
[02:00:30]  A little bit though  I mean it's literally  Been months  Since I've been out there  So I'm kind of  Wanting to get back out  But yeah  No I haven't  I haven't really  Gotten sick of it  It's actually been  You know  Finally really great  A great time  To be out there  You know  It's so tiring to me  Yeah well the difference  Bonnie is he doesn't  Drive from gig to gig  He flies in private jet  He's not like us  On a bus  Driving those lonely gigs  I knew  Here's what I knew  It was like  We don't drive  The lowest low  Is when you'd be 
[02:01:00]  Driving to gigs  And I would be eating  At like Burger King  Twice in a day  That's when it really blew  I'm like wait a minute  I was here for lunch  And now it's dinner  Now he's just buying  Burger Kings along the way  Cash  You know franchises  Nothing  Hold on  Please  Hey Dane  When you get this big  Do you have like a resentment list  That you like go back to  And kind of make phone calls  Or anything  You know it's funny  Even for  Even when I did  Vicious in Boston 
[02:01:30]  I was saying like  Even people who hated me  In like high school  And stuff like that  Were like calling me  Like yeah listen  You know can I get a couple  Of tickets to the show  Like exes  That like cheated  Or I cheated on  Like were calling  Let's work it out  I want you know  Can I sit in the third row  Oh man  Work it out  Yeah no no  Every  I still check my emails  And stuff every day  It's pretty interesting  Some of the people  That come out of the woodwork  That you're like  You know this person  Doesn't want to be writing me  But they're  Either looking for something  Or they're trying to figure out  Trying to figure out 
[02:02:00]  How to you know  Kind of get back in  So that's been a little weird  Just the level of exposure  You don't expect that kind of  I don't know  It's definitely  I'm still  To be honest guys  I don't know  It's kind of weird  I'm definitely  Figuring it all out as I go  But you know  The work speaks for itself  And all that other stuff  Is superfluous  And who knows what will happen  You know what's weird  It seems like yesterday  We saw you at the Comedy Connection  Yeah  No  That's got to be  Wow  But it really was man  It was really quick  Everything just kind of 
[02:02:30]  Just  Yeah  You know  I was doing the Connection  I was selling my stupid headshots after  And all  You know  The best thing you can do right now  Is just shoot yourself in the head  Really  Think about it  You would be  You would be  A legend  For all time  If you just shot yourself in the head  Right now  Wouldn't that be great  If you guys just heard a gunshot  And then you could have your fans  Write musical parodies to it  Right  Yeah  There's a lot of material  Dane  Give us something  Either a bullet  Or admit that you're banging Jessica Simpson 
[02:03:00]  We'll be huge because of you  I'm not  I'm not  All the tabloid shows  We'll have to play the audio  Come on  Let's go  Let's go  The only reason you're on the show  Let's go  I am trying to figure out a way  To make money off of his name somehow  I'm trying to figure out a way  I haven't figured it out  I'm going through Bobby Kelly somehow  I'm going to murder stupid Bob Kelly  And somehow link myself  Dane  We're the worst too  Because every once in a while  We'll get a celebrity in  That has a story to tell  And we'll be like  Ah come on man  It's just between us 
[02:03:30]  No one's really listening  As soon as they leave the studio  Alright  Email that to everyone you know  Get entertainment tonight on the phone  Stop the presses  The insider  Alright you woke up on the bus  And saw Bobby Kelly  With a sheet up to his chin  Like a bib  Eating your food or something  Something like that  A story  Bobby Kelly  I just last night  Finished watching an edit  That we're doing for the DVD  And it's  If I can say  It's a fuck montage  It's how many times Bobby said it  And we put it to music  Of the whole 30 days 
[02:04:00]  Yeah he's a potty mouth  Did you ever notice  Dane  You ever notice this about Bobby  And this bugs me about him  Bobby like  Rehearses what he's going to say  And then he pontificates  And he can't handle  Any deviation or interruption  Like you'll see him  Kind of zoning out  And then he'll walk in and go  You know dude  The whole thing with money  And the foreign exchange  And the minute you interject  I saw that idiot  Trying to do it  The other night  He's like correcting someone  About like when somebody  Like when Travolta got successful  And the guy's going  No Travolta owned a plane  Before he did Pulp Fiction  And Bobby goes 
[02:04:30]  No dude  That was his comeback  It's like no no  He owned it before  I saw a special  Here's a picture  Here's the registration number  From the tail  Here's it  That sociopath  Had rehearsed that Travolta speech  He roped somebody  Into talking about Travolta  And then he wouldn't deviate  From it  Until the guy said  He saw a special  And Bob goes  Oh alright  And then he finally  Oh alright  My fault  I just saw this clip  Of Bob  Did you know like  Everything's on  Every clip you could ever want  Is on YouTube now  Yep 
[02:05:00]  Oh that's  We're all about YouTube  Yeah  Yeah it's weird  The other day  If you just like  If you just punch your keyboard  In the search engine  And hit search  There's a video for that  There's a  If you hit A colon CF  There's like a fat kid  With A colon CF  Painted on his chest  Holding a wooden spoon  Singing A colon CF  A colon CF  And then his wooden spoon  Turns into a lightsaber  Dane  We were talking about  This with Korn earlier  You Google  Well you search 
[02:05:30]  Your name on YouTube  And then you see  Videos of yourself  And there's  Stuff up there  Like wow  Who filmed this  And where were they  You know  Do you have any  Of those up there  Yeah  I can't even do that anymore  It's kind of freaky  If I go there  It's like  Now people record stuff  With their camera phones  Like while  I was in a Boston market  Eating  Yeah  And it ended up online  Like just  And it was so  Just you eating  But you had no idea  At the time  That this person  Was you know  Filming you on their  You know  Their video phone 
[02:06:00]  Or whatever  Now it's on YouTube  And you're like  Oh my god  No I had no clue  Until somebody  Sent me the link  And then we were like  Hey dude  Here's you  Eating a quarter chicken  White  I'm like  What  And it really was  It was some guy  For like 40 seconds  Just filming me  Eating my lunch  I don't know what it is  But I can't get enough  Of YouTube  I'm on there  All the time now  Just checking out stuff  I like the  What's the  What's the website  It's got all the  The stars who  Don't want to admit  That they do commercials  For like  Bubble gum  And jeans 
[02:06:30]  They go to like Korea  And do these commercials  For like a million dollars  Oh yeah  Like Brad Pitt's  Done some of those  Yeah  They got one of Brad Pitt  He's like  He's like sledding  He's like doing like  Stair toboggan  Where he like  Slides down a set of stairs  Like he's in college  And then he's like  Nahada  Nahahi  And he starts speaking Korean  And he's wearing these hot jeans  And it's so embarrassing  But it's like  Brad Pitt  And this is a website  That's dedicated to all those commercials  Yeah  I get it  Oh wow  I'd love to check that out  Someone will email us the address  They also have one for bald celebrities 
[02:07:00]  Where they have like photos  Like a lot of celebrities  That are just bald  For real  And without their wigs  Really  Yeah I wish  You google that one  You'll find it too  What's that  Jim Norton dot com  No that's actually taken Rich  No need to hurt me  To make yourself feel better  Bobby  Bobby told me that the dude  From Law and Order  You know the main guy  On Law and Order  Yeah  That he's bald  That's a wig  But that  He's got that really short  Short hair  But that's fake  Who's the main dude  On Law and Order  It's in D'Onofrio  He's probably talking about  No it's the opposite  Mariska  Hugga  Hugga  Hugga 
[02:07:30]  Hugga  Special Victims Unit  Oh she just won something too  How did Shatner like  Get a wig that looks  Like real hair now  He went for years  With that big thing  And then during the roast  You could actually see like  Scalp and  Regular hair  He pulled it out of a pool drain  His looks weird  He's got like some kind of  Residue on his though  That always looks like  He just crawled out of a  Collapsed building 
[02:08:00]  It's just got that weird  Like ash dust  That's settled on it  He doesn't want to  I think the problem  Is he looks so old  Because Shatner's got to be  What is he 80  Or in his late 70's  In his 70's yeah  And yet his hair is kind of like  You know like a young guy's  Hairdo  It just does something  Really creepy and wrong  He went for years  With that big like  Poodle do  Yeah  But then I guess  He's tamed it down recently  When I saw the roast  On Comedy Central  He had like hair  That kind of fit him  I didn't see that yet  Is that where Andy Dick  Went bananas  Yeah Andy Dick 
[02:08:30]  Went around like  Licking everyone's face  And  I just did  I just did a movie with Andy  And  Down in  Employee of the Month  We were doing that together  And he was great  He was great for like  The first five weeks  And then he just  He lost it  Whatever he fell off  He fell far  And he started  Coming to set man  He was definitely  He was  He was all funky man  He got in some trouble  Down in the Costco  That we were filming at  Because some employees  Said he like  Squeezed their boob 
[02:09:00]  Or something  So he had to have a cop  He had to have a cop  In almost every other scene  That you see  That had to stand  Like six feet away  From Andy  So for all Andy's close ups  There was like a cop  Right off camera  Because he couldn't  He couldn't walk anywhere  In the store  Because of this  Supposed sexual harassment thing  Without the cop being there  Yeah he's got some issues  Yeah yeah  Dude you did that film  You did something  With Costner too  Yeah yeah  It's Mr. Brooks

[02:32:00]  Not a story  You can only say that  If a girl died  Smell it  What  If a girl died  You could say that  Like I fingered her after  Then people want to hear it  Oh my god  It suddenly isn't sexy  Don't you guys have a famous fingering story  Um  William  You and Voss  Uh oh  With his fingers  What could be possibly famous  They were mistaken for gargoyle hands  You told it on stage one time  I did some girl's belly button  And the whole time Rich was like  It's not true  It's not true  Which story wasn't true  I don't know 
[02:32:30]  Maybe it's the one where  I don't know  I don't want to get into our stories  Well but Bonnie knows the story  So what story are you referring to Bonnie  I don't remember  But you fingered a girl on the street  Oh yeah  On Broadway  Oh right  Oh no no  Not that time  Yeah yeah  No kidding  Jimmy was  Jimmy was getting ahead  No no  No  You want the story  I mean we said it  I know it's not true  But I knew it  It's a radio story  He can't hear anybody  Oh Jesus  Alright we'll play along  He can't hear anybody  Me and Jimmy were coming  Out of something  But you weren't 
[02:33:00]  Because this is just for the radio  Well this is a radio story  Of course  We've told it before  But I'll tell it real quick  It's not real  We were coming out of a building  And some girl comes up to us  And  What building  But is it true  Because you could say it's true  It was a 12 step meeting  Or something  I don't know  We were coming out  Let's say it was  The Daily Planet building  Because it's not a real story  Right  It's not real  That's why we use a fake building  It was Jimmy Olsen  And I was Lois Lane  Let's say it wasn't on Houston  Let's say it wasn't  Right  It wasn't anywhere even near it  Let's say we were coming out of a meeting  And then SOB's was right there 
[02:33:30]  And you just used it in Houston  Because it's local  It's a funny word  Yeah right on  And let's say like a  A nine and a half  To an eleven  Blackstick walks up to us  And recognizes me  And we're going to have bagels  And we take her  And I said  You want to go have a bagel with us  And we go have a bagel  Then we say  Hey we're going to go look at  Go up to the peep booth  Like it's a normal thing  After bagels  Would you like to come  Right  And she comes  And then say you go into the peep booth  And she goes into the stall with me  And the guy who's  The Indian guy who's homeless now  Kicks us out 
[02:34:00]  Right  Why you can't have a guy and a girl in there  No  Not that's what I heard  You can't have a guy and a girl  That's what he heard  So he's having another guy  And then say you're standing  On Broadway  Right across  In the Letterman Theater  But none of this happened  None of this  Never  And you're fooling around  Where there isn't a place  Called Show World  No  We're right across  And your hand slips  Under her dress  And say you're doing  Something with your finger  And a little bald headed guy  Is standing behind her  Squeezing her butt  Like it's Charmin's 
[02:34:30]  And his eyes are lit up  Right  And you have to look at this guy  He's just squeezing her butt  Like  How would the little guy  Be squeezing her butt  If you're fingering her  He's fingering her from the front  Right  And he's squeezing her  From the front  But she knows  She's been through this  And  It's so dirty  Because it would be less dirty  If you guys were actually having sex  Oh she's standing straight up  Yeah  But it's so dirty  Like that's so perverted  I didn't put my hand  In her dress  And squeeze it  And she wasn't just disgusted  By me  But she liked him  So she tolerated me 
[02:35:00]  Oh god damn  You know what I am  I'm like  I would like  Voss's shitty apartment  Like  You like somebody enough  You'll fuck them in the apartment  I was the downside  Then  Then we're driving around  I got about five of these  Fake stories  Fake stories  Yeah  We end up in Central Park  They're just fake  We end up in Central Park  Right  And  You know  She's on her knees  Going down on me 
[02:35:30]  Uh huh  And  And I look down  And you see Norton  Eating out her ass  Like it's  Ah  Like candy  Right  And he's got his tongue  Up her head  And  And  And  Right  And I'm not  I'm trying not to laugh  You guys have a pretty good imagination  Wow  Imaginaries you make up  Imagine I was eating her ass so deep  I actually  Tickled Voss's cock  Comment with my tongue  I doubt that  Oh damn 
[02:36:00]  Love the imagination  And then you're driving home  And you say to your little pal  Oh she ended up blowing Norton  As like you know  It was a consolation  I said look  I'll give you my CD  If you blow him  And  Swallow your saliva  And then carry on  And then  Oh god  So then you're driving home  And you go to Norton  Did you have a good time  He goes yeah  I was a little uncomfortable  I didn't want to  I got my  I didn't want to get my pants dirty  And then you go  You'll eat out a strange girl's ass  But you care about 
[02:36:30]  Hicking your pants  I don't want to get his pants dirty  He'll go home  He'll say look at the  Look at the dirt on your knees  Were you eating out strange ass again  See that's such an inconsistency  The story can't possibly be true  Sounds take to me  Because why would a guy  Yeah  Why would a guy care if his pants are dirty  When he's got his face buried  And some woman's black ass  Well these guys are joke writers  Yeah  Yeah  This is all  They know how to put the twist  It's all a pitch for a new sitcom  Yeah  That's true  It's a show called  What Voss Does When She Finally Dumps Him 
[02:37:00]  But say it  Say it wasn't true  Finally is getting closer  Until you get  When you get your papers  Here's the thing  Say it's true  Say it's true  Two more years  Say it was true  It's just say a girl decided to go down on me  It's not like a strange guy's never come up to you  And when you know  What ate me out in the bathroom  And you're out in the bathroom after a show  To some guy  Can I eat you out  Wow  And I have her tell me that story all the time  I only did it because I wanted to feel like a dude 
[02:37:30]  Like a guy comic  That a girl will go  Oh you're really funny  Can I blow you  And a guy just said  Can I eat you out  No he wanted to  That was the  Eat out is the dumbest word  For going down on pussy  I was about to say  Lick the baby maker  Even that's better than  He wants to trick her into admitting something  It's like you're actually tearing away flesh  And swallowing it  Phil told me the story about the guy  After the show  Makes it funny  She made out with me  And she goes  He goes  Can I just go down on your show  Well I want to hear Bonnie tell her  It's hotter 
[02:38:00]  I want to hear you tell her  I want to hear Bonnie tell her  Okay so I've just finished the show  Who are you wearing  Who was booking  He saw you crying on the side  Rich let us work now  I don't know  So what were you wearing  I was wearing a men's button down  Baggy pants  No bra right  Tell us no bra  So I don't know  He came up and he wanted to make out and stuff 
[02:38:30]  And I said no  And then we decided that  We would go into the bathroom  And he would go down on me  But nothing else would happen  Like I wouldn't touch him in any way  And so that's exactly  That's exactly what happened  Yeah but when I tell you  To tell me the story  You have to touch him though  In the story  Tell him about your professor  That you banged  Shut up with this  Line of questioning  The professor  Oh my god  I didn't bang him  You touched his  What happened  I tell you that for the story

[02:39:30]  Professor  He taught me how  He was the guy  Who taught me how  To give a blowjob  What a good professor  Wait you said you fooled around a lot  Did you blow him  Or you  See  Because I'm getting hard as a rock  Yeah me too  Holy shit boss  Wait a minute Bonnie  Now hold on  Was that the first time  You two had fooled around or no  Yes  Did you know what was going to happen  No I had no idea  So how did it happen  How did it actually move  That's a big move for him  To go with it  It certainly is  Well what happened was  I was  I kept missing class  What did he profess in 
[02:40:00]  And he  What was it  It was  I don't want to  You got her now  He was going to say that  But she didn't want to  He was a radio and television class  Oh of course  What a scumbag  He was a low  It was Edmonton  And he was a  Junior high by the way  He had his own TV show  A sports show  Oh after you blew him  Did he fly to Bangkok  Oh go ahead  Oh John  I was fooled  So tell us more  So  He put the plant in front of him  I was  Yeah I came in late again  And I knew he was going to be mad at me  So I faked tears  And pretended that my mom 
[02:40:30]  Was in the hospital  Which was a total lie  And then he wanted me  To come to his office  After  And so he started consoling me  About my mother  Which wasn't true  Wow what a predator  Like you saw an opportunity  Of a girl  That might be in distress  Your mother fell  Moved the plant  Yeah  And then it started off  Let me teach you how to give a blowjob  Did she fall on this  I started sucking his fingers  And it progressed  Wow you started sucking his fingers  How did  What did he like  Was he rubbing your face  Maybe  Gently 
[02:41:00]  And you just kind of  He was hugging me  Yeah  Did you feel him get turned on  What's that  Did you feel he had a heart on  When he was hugging you  I don't remember  You know  In those  It was like  If a guy wanted to have sex with you  You just went through with it  And got it over with  You just went through  What the hell is it  Caveman days  I know  Do you have a big penis  I know he asked you  That's why  I don't remember  I don't know  God is that exciting  I'm getting all dirty  I know  He wishes he had a professional like that  I wish I went to college

She was eight years old  Or something like that  Or ten years old  Right  When he grabbed her up  Somewhere in Germany  Ja  Das gut  And then  Kept her in some dungeon  He built underneath his house 
[03:08:30]  How did he survive?  What did I  He fed her  There was like an apartment down there  No windows or anything  But it was like an apartment  And she would clean  And you know  Cook  And he would go down  And have sex with her  Did he a homeschooler?  And she had books  Things you know  So she was learning  And kept her down there  For eight years  And how was he  Did he know her at all  Beforehand or no?  I don't think so  I think just kind of  Maybe a neighborhood 
[03:09:00]  Acquaintance type thing  But she was so well hidden  In his house  Underneath you know  The floor  And she escaped  She finally  Yeah  Eight years  He started loosening up  The security a little bit  Thinking that you know  She was there  Yeah  And she actually feels bad  That he killed himself  When did he kill himself?  She was asleep  Yeah right  Stockholm Syndrome  Yeah that's what they call it  What is Stockholm Syndrome?  When you fall for your captor  You  You have the time  To be captured  She's going through it right now  What?  Me? 
[03:09:30]  Being married to you?  I'm going to escape  I'm going to escape  Yeah she's going to escape  In two years  You know that's one of the  Tortures in the torture chamber  Is Mary  Rich Falls  Worse than the pear  Let's get to the audio  This is a pretty interesting story  He's the luckiest father  In the world  He says  After eight agonizing years  The child he thought he'd lost  Is found alive  Wow  The luckiest  I know  Luckiest  Now what happened  The first words were 
[03:10:00]  Puppy  I love you  She came to me  And we hugged  It was a feeling  Why can't we get a better translator?  I was going to say something  About the Jews  I think  I was blaming the Jews  For all this  Why does the translator  Always have to be monotone  Now  It doesn't matter  What the Germans are saying  Man  They built a dungeon  Yeah  Built a dungeon  We saw smoke  We saw smoke  But we did not know  Well the whole town  The father's  I guess he thought she was dead 
[03:10:30]  How far was she kept from home?  Did it say that at all?  I don't know  Counting going underground or  The live and learn here  The first words were  Puppy  I love you  She came to me  And we hugged  It was a feeling  I can't even describe  When Natasha Kampusch  Was abducted in 1998  She was just 10  For all of her teenage years  Natasha was held  In this cramped dungeon 
[03:11:00]  With a bed  A sink  And a toilet  She was given some  Children's books  But little else  Well this is the house  In Strasshof  Where Natasha was held  For more than 8 years  You can see  There are police outside now  Guarding the entrance  Most of the time  She was held securely  Under lock and key  But over the years  The man she came to call  Her master  Became increasingly careless  And eventually  She saw an opportunity  To escape  This is the man 
[03:11:30]  Police say  Imprisoned her  44 year old  Wolfgang Pricklepil  Neighbors say  Pricklepil  Quiet and polite  Wolfgang  Pricklepil  He threw himself  Under a train  Naughty Natasha  Yeah  Well there's a new name  Up for grabs  Who's gonna get it  Wolfgang  Prickpupil  Pricklepil  Pricklepil  He killed himself  Hours after she escaped  Yeah  Oh well  They asked the father  How he thought his daughter  Was before they found her 
[03:12:00]  No  She's dead  Ah  Is that true  She was very badly raped  You see  Well you know  This is the times  Yeah  It might be  Victim of the modern age  Poor poor girl  Well she lord  She was kept ten blocks  From her home  She lord  Good evening  Good evening  Uh well  Ten blocks  That was it huh  And the man ended up  Tricking the girl  Into staying  Like Ant was saying  What did he say  She was part of slavery  Huh  How did he trick her  Because there was a woman 
[03:12:30]  Named Colleen Stan  This girl at least was ten  When she was kidnapped  Colleen Stan from California  Was kidnapped like this  Um  When she was like 19 or 20  Or whatever  She was an adult  Stupid  And well she was kidnapped  By a guy and his wife  She was kept in a coffin  Under the bed  Wow  For I think seven years  They had her  Oh  And yeah  You want to talk about  Claustrophobia  You want to talk about  Claustrophobia  They had a big bed  And under it  They built in a thing  That you could close  It was closed in 
[03:13:00]  It had air vents  But she was cuffed  For a long time  With like a box  On her head  Like  Yeah I think I read  About this story  Maybe there's a similar one  It's called  A perfect victim  Or something  Um  And for seven years  They had her  And they had kids  And stuff  And they would go away  For the weekend  And one time  She almost suffocated  Because they went away  And they forgot  It got to be like  Over 110 degrees  In the little coffin  I don't understand  How do you forget  How do you forget  How do you do it  They convinced her  Through like  You know again  That's an emotional thing  Eventually they convinced her  That she was part 
[03:13:30]  Of a slavery ring  And they showed her  A contract  And he said  That he had bought her  And what would happen  Is she escaped  Because her family  Would be killed  And there was a couple  Of times  Oh yeah  She was actually  Allowed to go back  And see her family  And she did  And she returned to them  Ah  She was so fucked up  Over it  Look her up  Colleen Stan  S-T-A-N  I believe is her last name  How do you not  Go back with a weapon  And just kill them  I know  She eventually did escape  She was so psychologically  Fucking destroyed  Like she really thought  She was part of a slavery ring 
[03:14:00]  I guess this guy was good  And after a while  She believed it  And thought that her family  Would be killed  And she never  He's like  Cops are in on this  She just didn't know  Cops are in on it  Didn't she write letters  Home a lot  And stuff too  Is that the one  Well yeah  But that was only once  He had allowed her that  After years  Very nice guy  And then he would go  And she actually went home  A couple times  And came back  And eventually  She did escape  She was working  She gave her a job  She went out and got a job  At like a motel  Doing some kind of a weird  Like fucking maid's job  And she told somebody  At the hotel  And they called the police  And stuff 
[03:14:30]  And his name was Cameron something  And I forget the wife's name  But the jury said  The thing that convinced them  Was the way Colleen  Was just completely dead emotionally  Testifying  When she went home  Her father said  You're so damaged  You can't come here  Without the box  Get it?  I don't get it  You don't get it?  He kind of gets it  I kind of get it  Because it's kind of a sick thing  The father would make her  Come back with the box  Well you can't return  Damaged goods  Without a box  Oh  Alright 
[03:15:00]  Wait  For seven years  Did they let her out  To eat or something?  No no  Not for seven years  She didn't eat  No I mean  What I'm saying is  They didn't make her  Sit near 24  Did you feel  Shecky Green  Was bigger than Alan King?  I mean  All kidding aside  Get to the root  Of the matter here  Yeah  Well I think for a long time  They kept her in a box  In a coffin  With a box on her head  And her mouth taped  I mean  You want to talk about  Claustrophobia  She wasn't kept  In a room like this  They didn't have that  You know  They kept her  And then one time  They finally decided  To let her out  And chain her to the bathroom 
[03:15:30]  And one of the little kids  Saw her  Right back in the box  For years  Oh  Oh my god  And how long  Did they go to jail  For the rest of their lives  I hope  No I think time served  They did three months  Yeah  They had to clean up  Some garbage  On the side of the highway  Could have been longer  Than that Jim  Perhaps longer than that Jim  Mort Saul  Yeah do you feel  Mort Saul  I mean  Was he more progressive  Was he underrated  You think  Or  He didn't hit the way  He was supposed to  He had a lot of resentment  Against guys like  Will Durst  And other political comments  Why though 
[03:16:00]  Because he was like  One of the first political comments  This rehearsed  Yeah  No I knew that  A verbal book report  No it isn't  I know that off  I just know it  Mort Saul or Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce was more edgy  And more controversial  At the time  Mort Saul was doing political  Which nobody really was doing it  But it wasn't  Wouldn't that make him  Controversial then  No because  But the police weren't  The police weren't  Arresting him  And locking him up  You know  What about the subtlety  Of a Henry Gibson  I don't know who that is 
[03:16:30]  He's on from laughing  Rowan and Martin laughing  With the flowers  Because he was in high school  When that was on  This is what the show  Is going to be  It's going to be like  You just telling me  He knew something  That no one else knew  Except for Anthony  But it was  It sounded like  Book report knowledge  No it isn't  It's just  No  Well you know  Will Durst  He had resentment  Against such modern people  It's like when you  End the goods and services  When you deliver them  The worst thing about  Mort Saul  Is he was put under a bed  For five years  What am I supposed to say  That's the story  About Mort Saul  Alright let's go to  Chris in Pennsylvania  Chris  Welcome aboard 
[03:17:00]  Chris  Hey man how you doing guys  Better now thanks  Thanks  Hey Jimmy  There's two things  About this lady  You're talking about  First she was not  Allowed to wear underwear  And never could close  Her legs  As she did  She got beaten for it  Secondly the wife  Had just as much sex  With this woman  As the husband  The wife is actually  Who picked the woman out  Oh yeah  They were  Shopping  They were driving  She was hitchhiking  And I know the wife  I'm imagining though  Dude that the wife  Was so psychologically  Destroyed by this guy  It's almost like  Carla Bernardo  Was definitely 
[03:17:30]  Guilty too  Because she got involved  Yeah how perverted  Was that  I read the book  Perverted  Sexy  Whatever you want to call it  I jerked off  Reading the book  Oh my god  You are sick  I know  I know  I went to  Who's the guy  Who ate people  Jeffrey Dahmer  Jeffrey Dahmer  There was a movie  About Jeffrey Dahmer  And I was on a date  And the guy  In the middle of the movie  And it's a pretty disturbing movie  He goes  Feel how hard I am  And then you married him  How were your grades 
[03:18:00]  No sometimes  The thing I didn't like  About the  Obviously the barbarism  Of the Bernardo guy  Was a piece of garbage  But you know  The girls he raped  Were all 15  Which was you know  Sickening  But then he killed him  With a sister  Well that's the hot part  He raped and killed the sister  They didn't mean to kill him  So sick  Carla Homolka  Her younger sister Tammy  Carla was dating Paul  And Tammy was like 15  And Paul  As a birthday gift  Carla helped drug her sister  So Paul could rape her  Yeah  And then Carla went down on her 
[03:18:30]  I know  And they videotaped  All this stuff  And they kidnapped two girls  Kristen and Leslie  And they did the same thing  And Paul would fuck her  And she kept having to say  I love you Paul  I love you Paul  It was really perverted  He would piss on her  In the hot tub  And all of this was filmed  Jesus  And then Carla cuts a deal  Because he was brutalizing her  Carla cuts a deal  And this is all in Canada  So there was a media blackout  In Canada  And  Turns on him  She gets 12 years  He's obviously  A life without parole  And then they find  The videotapes  After the deal's been cut 
[03:19:00]  Which shows Carla  Willingly participate  Yeah  In the proceeds  Although again  She was a battered  Beat up fucking  You know  Here's a photo of her  I can always run the fuck away  Just stop it  I agree  No no but I'm saying  Like there was  Like stupid  Head of Nussbaum  With a big beat up face  Leave you dumb bitch  There was one photo of her  That was just  Like she had raccoon eyes  Because he had a flashlight  I mean he was just  Remember we read  One day on the show  There was a contract  That some guy had  With his wife  Oh yeah yeah  Paul made Carla  Sign a contract like that 
[03:19:30]  And I read it  And it was like  I will  When Paul asks for something  I will bring it  Quickly and happily  It was like that funny language  Like you'd think  It was like a goof  Happily  Happily  Quickly and happily  I will always smile  When Paul asks me to do something  It was really great  You know what I noticed  A while ago  You're like the rain man  Of serial killer knives  I know  I'm an ass  No because  Every once in a while  We'll go down this road  And you'll know the names  Pretty much the dates  Places  We all know the basic ones  But he knows the names  Of serial killers  I've never heard of before  Talk about  What was his name  Edwin or Edward Kemper 
[03:20:00]  Edmund  That's one of his favorites  Edmund Kemper  That's Jimmy's favorite  I think he was called  I want to say  The colored killer  In California  He's 6'6  Oh wait  That's not your favorite  Which one  Is he the one with the mom  Yeah  The mom  Oh no that's Edmund Kemper  He decapitated his mother  Had her head in a bowling bag  Yeah yeah yeah  But then he banged her  With her head  Well he didn't say  He banged her  He said what he did  Was  No no he had a co-ed head  In a bowling bag  While he talked to his mother  Because he hated his mother  And he murdered his mother  And they said something like 
[03:20:30]  What did you do after that  And his words I think  Were something along the lines  Of I humiliated the body  I don't know what he did  But then he decided  To call one of her friends  The last murder he committed  He called one of her best friends  Over there  Saying that the mother  Needed him  When the friend came  He murdered her  And then just turned himself in  But he's  Tired and feathered  The body  Yeah  To make it funny  I'll give you one more  And this guy I read a book on  And no one's ever heard of him  See  No one's ever heard of this guy  I've been meaning to say this  On the show for a long time  That you just know all this stuff 
[03:21:00]  And by the way  Carla and Paul  With the back of your hand  Did not mean to kill Tammy  She was drugged  And she overdosed  She choked on her own puke  But they did not mean to kill her  Oh okay  Then they're great people then  But it is sort of  An incredible love story  I mean it's hard to find  Another person  That you're going to get along with  Like the same music  Yeah they really share  The same interests  Yeah  We're going to rape and kill together  I mean to find someone else  That shares that  That is sweet  Here's one that was brutal  It's romantic  This guy was a gay  This is just like the notebook  He was a gay dude 
[03:21:30]  Gay dude in California  They say they suspect  He killed six or something people  No  No not that one  Oh okay  Not Richard  And he would drug  Marines and shit  He killed men  And he would drug you  And he would pick up hitchhikers  But I mean like manly men  He didn't just prey on like weak people  He would  He was a sexual sadist  He would fucking feed you beer  While you hitchhiked  And it was drugged  And when you passed out  Apparently you woke up  And he would torture these guys  Oh boy  They found guys like  With the cigarette lighter  All burned on their nipples 
[03:22:00]  On their cocks  He put fucking swizzle sticks  In their dick holes  Ha ha ha  Ay yay yay  And they found them  With tree branches up there  He was like a real sadist  So hard  Randy Kraft  Was his name  The K  K-R-A-F-T  Oh  K-R-A-F-T  They estimate 60 something people  Yeah  Did you ever read any  John Douglas books  Yeah  Of course  And Robert Ressler  Is the guy that actually  Coined the term  Serial killer  Yeah  They fight over who  Came up with profiling  Ressler and Douglas 
[03:22:30]  Oh they're both good  Alright let's  Wow  Let's say hi to Brad  In New Jersey  Brad  Hey guys what's going on  Welcome aboard Brad  Great show on at the PNC  By the way last week guys  Fantastic  Thanks man  Had a lot of fun  A lot of the New Yorkers  Are going down on the Philly show  By the way  Lawn seats $10  For September 9th show  No problem  I want to add to Jimmy  Because I'm originally from Toronto  And he made mention about  The Homolka  The Scarborough Rapist  Scarborough Rapist  That's right  He and his wife  Actually she helped him  With all the killings  But not only that 
[03:23:00]  He actually  The first person that they killed  After his  His sister-in-law  So to speak  They cut her up  And put her in cement  Yeah was that  There was either  There was Leslie Mahaffey  And Chris and French  Yeah  Leslie Mahaffey  He knows  This is crazy  There was one thing  They were brutal  There's one rumor  And I don't know if this is true  That to keep them from running  They cut the Achilles  So they couldn't get away  I don't know  As a matter of fact  They did it on some of them  Yeah  They did  Well they only kidnapped two  I mean  He was a rapist 
[03:23:30]  And then they  How many did they kill  All of the other  Three including the sister  Yeah and then the cement  Came apart or something  It didn't quite  Somebody found  The Bernardo  Bernardo's yeah  Yeah  Even to the point  Where the Toronto Transit  Commission  Like the buses and stuff  They started it where  They would let girls off  Anywhere they wanted  Instead of the designated bus stops  Because it was  It was getting to be pretty bad  Okay so you couldn't predict  Where they were getting it off  Exactly  Carla just got out actually  She's now out  Oh good for her  She cut the deal  Before they found the tape  I don't know  She's married to Richard Ramirez 
[03:24:00]  Aw  And his bad teeth  They couldn't bring her up  On any of the charges  Like you know  Like civil or something like that  You know  After  I don't know  I mean I guess not  And they certainly would  Let's say hi to Bill in Vegas  Bill  Hey I wanted to talk about  Arthur Shawcross  I didn't know  Rochester right  Rochester that's right  That was going on  When I was up there  I know the name  But I don't know  What exactly did he do  Well he killed a bunch of women  He had his own personal motto  It's not a party  Without Artie 
[03:24:30]  But the one thing  I liked about him  He cut a woman's  External genitalia off  He would carry it around  In his pocket  And during times of  Stress or emotional upheaval  In his life  He could always reach  Into his pocket  And fondle it  And feel good  True  That's great  Wouldn't it get like  Jerky though  After a while  Probably put it in a bag  I imagine that would be  A problem  Yes  Yeah he killed hookers  In the Rochester area  Wow  What was his last name? 
[03:25:00]  Shawcross  Oh Shawcross  I think  Professor Shawcross  Oh my god  We're down this road now  This is fine  People love killing  And we got an expert  In the studio  I know this is a long time ago  Jimmy  Jeff in Cleveland  Hey yeah  I want to know  If Jimmy knew  About Jeffrey Lundgren  He was a  Kirtling cult killer  I'm sorry?  Jeffrey Lundgren  Kirtling cult killer  No  He formed a 
[03:25:30]  Secondary church  Within the Mormon church  And then he  Convinced a few people  When they left  He chopped them up  And buried them  In a barn  And he knew a girl  That spent the night  With the daughter  At the barn  Like a week before  They found the bodies  Wow  Yeah  Anyway  I was wondering  If you heard of him  No no  I've never heard of that guy  Who was the guy  That was  Sending  That was picking up  Hitchhikers  Not Gacy  He would send out people  I think it was in Texas  He had a barn  He would send out  He was an old guy  And he would send out  Like two guys  To pick up hitchhikers 
[03:26:00]  And he killed like  30 or 40 people  And buried them  In his barn  Oh I don't know  I just know about Gacy  Buried them under the house  Yeah let's go to Spence  In New York  Spence  Hey Jimmy  I was wondering  What about Ed Gean  Ed Gean  He's the guy  That they  Isn't Buffalo Bill  Based on him  Yeah I think so  He's making a suit  They did a bunch of movies  Like uh  South of the Lambs  Was loosely based off of him  And uh  They said Psycho  Was loosely based off of him  So there's a whole bunch of like  Movies loosely based off of him  I never really heard anything  Specific on him 
[03:26:30]  I think  I'm sorry to interrupt you  But I think  I think there was a quote by him  And I could be attributing this  To the wrong killer  It might have been him  Or uh  But there was one guy  Who said that they talked to him  They profiled him  And spoke to him  Because that's what these profilers do  They'll talk to you  And figure out  Why did you fucking  Become this way  And he goes  The first thing I think of  When I see a pretty girl  Is what it would be like  To date her  To be her boyfriend  To be with her  And the second thing I think of  Is what her head would look like  On a stick  In New Orleans  During Mardi Gras 
[03:27:00]  That was what he said  That was  Which is you know  At least  He didn't go in the other order  Would be beyond sick  At least he went in the proper order  Yeah  I think that was it  Again though  Or again  I believe you're correct  Slayer did a song on them too  I can't remember the name of the song  Off the top of my head  But whenever they do a concert  They'll show like his pictures  And like  I'm sure it was a power ballad  Yeah  I dismember you  Did Richard Speck kill anybody  Besides those nurses  Or was it just that one rampage 
[03:27:30]  I think it was just  That's a mass murder  I think  I think it was just them  I don't know much about him  Wow  You see the breast he grew in prison  Oh he was a done  Naughty boy  Let's go to Sean  And poke with his tits  What do you mean  Awesome  Sean  Hi  I was wondering  I was wondering if you guys  Remember that  Rapist in Buffalo  He was raping long haired DJs  Oh wow  Very good  Very good  The scariest night of my life  Or morning whatever  Very good 
[03:28:00]  You ever hear that story  I've told it a million times  Forget it  It's just  Tell it as quickly as you can  Go ahead  With the least amount of detail  But the most story  But they haven't heard it  I was doing overnights in Buffalo  And I lived like  Like a block from the station  In a brownstone  But it was in a really scary neighborhood  But the building was alright  But we had security  Two doors  That locked nice  And then my apartment  I usually locked  Come home 
[03:28:30]  I'm not thinking  I think it was like  Early Saturday morning  I come home  And I'm taking a nap  Or whatever  Right  And I go through the front doors  And I go upstairs  And I go into my apartment  And not lock it  Okay  What happens is  Someone's moving out of the building  Both doors are open  A little back story  There was a black rapist  Loose in Buffalo  It was all over the news  All over the news  All over the papers  So I'm sleeping  And I wake up  Because I feel  Someone is in my bedroom  I open my eyes  There's a black gentleman 
[03:29:00]  Inches from my face  Looking at my face  And I think I had the covers  Over my head or whatever  But I had long hair  He was looking to see  If I was a chick or not  Oh my god  I open up my eyes  I don't move  Because I'm like  You know  Just don't move  Keep keep keep keep  Yeah exactly  Scariest day of my life  So I open up my eyes  And I just say  Something stupid  Like what are you doing here  And I guess at that point  He realized I wasn't a chick  Gets up  And runs out of my apartment  Maybe you handled it well  Where he didn't freak out  Because you weren't yelling at me 
[03:29:30]  And he had  I think  Yeah he had a hood  Over his head or whatever  But  And  What are you doing here  Oh  Yeah  And then  I'm like  Holy shit  Holy shit  Holy shit  And I obviously woke up  Immediately  And now I'm chasing him  Out of the building  Because I'm like  You know  Is he  What is this  You know  Come back  And then I  Used to put my wallet  And my keys  Right next to the door  And as I was running out  I'm like  He stole my wallet  And my car  Keys  And that's all I was thinking  Got out of the building  To see these dopes  Carrying a couch out  Or something  And then I get out of the building  And I see him running down the street 
[03:30:00]  As fast as he can  And you know  It could have been the rapist  That was loose in Buffalo  Who knows  Were the people moving  Did you ask them  If they saw the guy  Did you use the shortest  Possible description you could  Why  That's a quick story  What are you going to  No no no  I mean what are you going to say  To the guys carrying the couch  Did you see a gentleman  Right right right  About six foot tall  Or did you just say  Hey did you see  But these fuckers were moving  And that you know  Left the door open  And I stupid enough  Left my door open that day 
[03:30:30]  Turned out they didn't get  He or whatever  Didn't get my keys  And wallet  I had it in my jean pocket  Or whatever  But it was scary  To wake up  Or your ass  Great story  If it started off  There was a bisexual rapist  In Buffalo  Dude it was  It was scary though  You never know man  And you know  Extremely frightening  And I usually lock the door  But I wasn't thinking  I'm thinking  I have the two doors  Downstairs  Are always locked  But of course  That day  Someone had to be  Moving out  They broke into my  Like our bedroom  When I was a little kid  There was a fire escape  Right up  And I was in home 
[03:31:00]  I was across the street  Getting high  Smoking pot  And my mother's  Laying in the bed  Reading  And this black dude  Just climbs into the fire escape  Goes through my window  And walks into my mother's bedroom  She just flies past him  And runs out the house  Right  So we're sitting there  In the house across the street  And we're so high  And we see all these  Cop cars pull up  And we're like  Oh fuck  We're getting raided  Right  So we ran  And we start ditching  All our pot and stuff  And then I find out  That they broke in my house  Then they broke in again  And tied my grandmother up  To the chair 
[03:31:30]  No  Yeah they tied my grandmother up  These black dudes  Tied her up  And kicked my dog Frisky  That's what  Yeah they tied her to the chair  Why'd they kick  What kind of dog was Frisky  It was a little  Cocker Spaniel  It was a dog  That liked prime rib  Why'd they kick Frisky  Frisky  Here's a great line  Jason in South Carolina  Jason  Hey Steve  What's up man  Okay  I was going to say  Why didn't you ask the black guy  What's my problem  You're in my

[03:32:30]  Came up  Gave her a hand with it  You know  Went his way  A couple days later  She looked on the news  And saw who the guy was  It was Ted Bundy  Wow  Because you know who that was  Ted Bundy  He didn't fit his profile  I guess  On the instant feedback  Mr. Torrance from The Overlook  Opie as guys  As the guy is running away  I'll fix your English there  Come back  I have marshmallows  And java logs  Come back  And somebody  The guy last night  I think one of the guys  Gave me a note here  Was saying  He was an inspiration 
[03:33:00]  For Leatherface  Texas Chainsaw  Do you know what  Edmund Kemper man  One of the victims  That he would pick you up  Hitchhiking  He lived by a college  And didn't murder you  And one time  He picked a girl up  And he was going to kill her  But he saw her companion  Whoever she was with  Kind of look in the street  And write something down  So he assumed  That they were writing down  His car type  Just picking  And he actually let her live  And he dropped her off  And he told a story  He's like a brilliant guy  He's like a six  I want to say six six  Three fifty 
[03:33:30]  He's a massive  Man  And he told one story  About how he murdered  Two college girls  They both slit their throats  And they were in his car  And he had to talk his way out  Of the security  With them in his car  Dead  Like they were sleeping  Or something  I don't know  Sleeping  Yeah he's a bright guy  Is he still alive  Oh yeah yeah  Where is he  What prison  I don't know  I don't know  I'm going to go home  I'm going to go home  And watch cartoons  After today's show  What  What about the  Comedian rapist  Maybe we can  Tie it in 
[03:34:00]  Slide in to yours  Vince  Yeah  Vince Champ  He was working colleges  And then he would go back  To the school  That he worked  Yakko Smirnoff  No  Underrated  He raped the public  Scott in Canada  What's up  Hey Jimmy  I was just wondering  If you knew about  Robert Pickton  No I don't  He was a serial killer  In B.C.  He was a pig farmer  That long ago  Oh he fed him to the pigs  He killed cave girls  He'd kidnap hookers 
[03:34:30]  And kill them  And feed them to his pigs  No one cares about the hookers  Really  Yeah well it took a long time  To catch him  Because no one did care  No one cares  The serial killer hookers  When they're killing hookers  No one cares  Nah  You find a couple of them  In the dorms  And they found like  Something like 60 bodies  On his farm  Oh that's the one  Someone was asking me  What do you guys know  Yeah  A fertilizer  Yeah  Let's go to Steve  Those really are good fertilizer  That's true  Steve in Florida  Hey do you guys remember  Danny Rowling  In Janesville Florida 
[03:35:00]  Yeah he  Yeah they're college students  Yeah I was a student there  In 90 and 91  I played football there  And we had a guy  Black kid that played football  And he was going down  In the dorm  With like a mask  And a fake knife  And he got punched  In the face  By one guy  For doing it  It was a scary time  Because he  He was mainly  Killing women though  But still  It was pretty scary  Do you know  Most of these guys  Get caught driving too  I guess because  They drive so much  Bundy got pulled over  Because he had a Volkswagen  With the passenger seat removed  And like rape kit stuff in it  And that greedy dope 
[03:35:30]  Would have got away  Because he escaped in Colorado  He like would have been fine  If he had just stayed in Florida  And been a good boy  Yeah  And Randy Kraft  Got pulled over driving  And he had a fucking  A guy  A dead guy  In his passenger seat  With his pants open  So the cops pulled him over  For speeding or whatever  And he gets out  And walks to the cop car  Which is always suspicious  To a cop  Like you're hiding something  Yeah what are you hiding  And they walk up  And who's this  He's sleeping  He was dead in his  Joel Rifkin's another one  Out on Long Island  Was he driving when he got caught  He was driving  He had his little pickup truck  With a dead hooker in the back  And the cop pulled him over 
[03:36:00]  And was like  Eh  What you got back there  Ah dead hooker  Let's do that bit  Remember we were working on it  A bit  Rape and Murdered a musical  Excuse me ma'am  Can you help me  You were working on it  I  A lot of people think  Lenny Bruce opened the door  For more modern day satirists  You're feeling  I keep a big butcher knife  Between my mattress  And the box spring  And she didn't know it  And the other night  I go  Hey take a look at this  And I pull it out  And I go like that  And I almost jammed it 
[03:36:30]  In her eye  Oh good one  That's great  You sleep with a butcher knife  Is he bizarre  He's a nut right  Why would you sleep  With a butcher knife  You could kill yourself  Rolling over  He probably always dreams  That he's eating  Kefilta fish  Let's say hi to  John in Pennsylvania  John  Hey guys  This is a question  The FBI asks  Every serial killer  That they interview  And they get it right  On the first try  Let's see if Jimmy  Can get it right 
[03:37:00]  There's two sisters  They're at their mother's funeral  In walks this guy  They've never seen him before  They don't know him from Adam  The one sister  Falls madly in love  With this guy  Doesn't talk to him  Nothing  He leaves  About two weeks later  She kills her sister  Why does she kill her sister?  I know that one too  I've read it  I fucking know that one  You can ask any question 
[03:37:30]  Is it a Shrunk Gap t-shirt?  Is that involved?  Wait  Can you say the beginning part again?  There's two sisters  At a funeral  A guy walks in  Neither has ever seen him before  At their mother's funeral  I'm sorry  Okay  Guy walks in  The mother's funeral  Okay  Say it again  Never seen him before  Nobody knows him from Adam  The one sister  Falls head over heels  In love with this guy  Just by seeing him  Yeah  About two weeks later  She kills her sister  Why does she kill her sister? 
[03:38:00]  Over to Will?  I'm annoyed  Because I've actually read this question  I don't know  I can't recall  But I don't know  So he would come  To her funeral  Oh  So he would come back  To the funeral  It's just  How they get in  They see out of mind  Of a serial killer  Oh wait a minute  She didn't run off  With the guy?  They didn't have a relationship  You gotta  You gotta  Specify  We assume that  When she fell  Head over heels  In love with him  That they were together  Yeah  I'm sorry  But that's  But a serial killer  Would  I thought that you meant 
[03:38:30]  They ran off together  And hooked up  And then  He convinced the sister  I didn't understand that  Yeah  She never  She never knew him  But she  She wanted to see him  So badly again  So she could get to know him  Alright  So she killed the sister  To the funeral  Okay  I didn't understand that  Snopes.com by the way  Says  This is false  What that?  Yeah  Yeah  That question?  As far as  You know  Asking every serial killer  I have read that question before  I just didn't remember the answer  Maybe it was asked to one guy  Yeah 
[03:39:00]  And I'll tell you  The most disturbing  I think probably the worst account  I've ever read  From a serial killer  Because it was a kid  Was  They never caught the killer  John Walsh's son  Oh yeah  And it was fucking  He thinks it was  I think Henry Lee Lucas' guy  Otis Toole  And he confessed to it  He said  I did Adam  I killed him  And then he recanted his confession  And died of cancer  So they never solved it  But he told the story  Of how he got the kid  And what he did  Look it up online  You'll find it somewhere  It's the fucking  Worst thing I've ever read 
[03:39:30]  Horrific  Horrific  Alright  A couple more of these  Let's say hi to Brandon  In South Carolina  Just keeping it light  And fun today  Yeah  Whose dick isn't hard  I challenge you  Jimmy have you ever heard  Of Pee Wee Gaskins  Nope  No wait  He traveled up and down the coast  Low country South Carolina  Picking up hitchhikers  He did shit like  Cut girls nipples off  And make them eat them  Just nasty  Crazy shit  I think now people  Start getting like  When we get into this subject 
[03:40:00]  For any length of time  They start getting like  Yeah did you hear this one  And then you look on Snopes  And all of a sudden  Nah it's bullshit  I don't know who Pee Wee Gaskins is  Alright let's try one more  Jeff  It's a nipple  Hey boys  Question for Jimmy  Have you ever heard of a guy  Named Casey Martin  Out of Tampa  That kidnapped a girl  Named Amanda Brooks  Back in the late 80s  If she was 15  He kidnapped her  From a bus stop  And she ended up 
[03:40:30]  Falling for him  And wouldn't leave  And  Long story short  She had lived  With her grandparents  And about nine months  After the whole deal  Had done  Her grandparents  Had come up dead  They didn't pin them together  And then  A Burger King  Manager  Had come up dead  Well  Once they finally  Figured everything out  They put it all together  She went back  And confessed to everything  That she had killed  Her grandparents 
[03:41:00]  Because he needed  Gas money to go to work  And then ended up  Killing the Burger King  Manager  Because he got  Passed over for a raise  And she claims  That he had  Brainwashed her  To believe  That she wouldn't  Get in any trouble  For all this  Because she was a minor  And he got eight years  For kidnapping  She's doing life  In prison  That's how  Out of control  Gas prices are  See  Right  And that's how  The Burger King  That's a corporate system  You want to play the game  And give the raise  As to who they belong 
[03:41:30]  That's a cutthroat business  That's right  There was a murder  In Jersey  Where they found  A little girl  That was taken away  From a carnival  In Perth Amboy  And her sneaker  Was found  And did they ever  Saw it  Did you ever read  About that one  I remember it  I remember it  Yeah it was awful  Well let's finally  45 minutes later  That guy lost me  Then the grandma  Come up dead  Yeah yeah yeah  Did she come up dead  We got the second clip  From the man  Holding girl hostage  In Dungeon  For eight years  Yeah 
[03:42:00]  Good  What has Natasha  Told you about  What her life  Was like  For that eight years  In captivity  In the dungeon  He scared her  He told her  He had asked  For a million dollar ransom  That he had called me  For two years  And I would not react at all  He also told her  The house was rigged  With explosives  And if she ran away  Something terrible  Would happen  Natasha hasn't appeared  In public yet  But her father told me  She seems okay 
[03:42:30]  At least on the surface  If you remember  She has spent eight years  In a dungeon  She looks relatively good  But she's very skinny  She looks alright  But you can see  There are effects  Imagine all those years  You think somebody's dead  And then they come back  Yeah  Judge in Alabama  Hey what's up guys  Hey judge  I was just wondering  Have you guys  Ever heard of any  Black serial killers?  You never hear  Yeah what's his name?  Timothy Spencer was one 
[03:43:00]  In Virginia  The dude in Atlanta  Wayne Williams  Was definitely one  And there was another guy  Killing white girls  I think  In  I want to say  Upstate New York  But yes  Timothy Spencer  Was like a cross racial one  Which is rare  He was a rapist at first  And they started  Fucking raping  And slow strangulation  And yeah  I just know  It's a ratio  I guess  You normally just hear  Way more white serial killers  I don't know why that is  Because black people  Can't afford cars 
[03:43:30]  And it's also  Probably statistically  So rare  If you have one in a million  That are going to behave that way  Well there's a lot less  Black people  Than there are white people  So I think the odds  Are you're just going to get  You know  I think it's probably numerical  Yeah it's just a stat thing  Hey Justin Alabama  What's up  Hey what's going on boys  Good morning to ya  Good morning to ya  Hey there Mike  Hey  Pretty good  I have one  And also excuse me  John Muhammad and Lee Malvo  Jesus how did we forget them  Ah yeah  The snipers  Go ahead Matt  I'm sorry  Yeah

We got four of their wonderful TVs  You weren't there when Tom came in to work late  Yeah, I didn't know what he wanted  And kind of discussed our first break  And said, boy, I wish I was here  Because I think he was going to march right in  He really did wish he was there

Have you both dozed off?  I could do it right now  If you guys recorded it  It might be better than what Rich and I are going to do at 11

What's the problem?  I'm sorry  What's wrong with your outfit?  The sleeves  One sleeve is longer  I don't know what the problem is  Who cares?  Yeah  I see a magician  What time do you have to

I think we're supposed to arrive around  Make everyone yawn out there  4 o'clock  I think we're arriving there  Hopefully some people  Will show up to support us  Yeah  And then we go in  We get our little makeup  And then  And then  We talk to somebody  Do we talk to somebody?  No  No one 
[03:53:30]  We just sit in the green room  After makeup  Yeah  And then  Somebody comes in  And goes  You're ready  Or you're on  Or what do they do?  What do they say?  It's cool you're doing a pre-interview  Yeah  They'll come down  And go  Three minutes  Three minutes  Good  So you get like a countdown  Are you nervous now?  I haven't been nervous in a really long time  I'm fucking petrified  It'll be fun  But you guys  I'm nervous  Why would you be  PNC walking down  In front of everything  12,000 plus people  Not a problem  No  Only 12,000 
[03:54:00]  What?  Only 12,000  That's cool  This is the millions  But I  They should let them in England  Exactly  But I think  It was no problem at the PNC  Because you can't see anyone  The lights are so bright  Yeah but I mean  Wouldn't it be better  Because there's two of you  If one  Doesn't even matter  Yeah I think it's something  The other one  So if we both can't  We just both look stupid  Get quiet like  You're a professional talker  You know how bad  I wish Leverton had a car crash  Yeah  How about  What song are we coming out to you?

[04:00:30]  You're gonna look right to left  Because of Letterman  Whoever  It should be Opie in the main seat  Because you're gonna look  Opie and Anthony  You won't look  Opie and Anthony Letterman  It just won't happen that way  Your eyes will be drawn  To the middle  Yeah  Opie and Anthony  When we do TV  I like being in the middle  And seeing you  And again  I feel so comfortable that way  But I don't care  To be honest with you  I'm just like  But you're less nervous  Right  Who's ever the farthest from Dave  I will be fine  Once I'm on  And sitting  Then I go off  I can talk
