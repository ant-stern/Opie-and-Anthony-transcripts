<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter before pivoting to a discussion of recent deaths, including Ken Ober (a former writer for *Tough Crowd* and *Remote Control*), Brooke Phillips (associated with the show and Dennis Hoff from the Bunny Ranch, who was reportedly shot and possibly burned alive while pregnant), and actor Edward Woodward.  The conversation then shifted to the death of Boston comedian Kevin Knox, prompting discussion of other Boston comedians. A caller mentioned seeing George Lopez call Sarah Palin's book "a piece of shit" on TV, sparking a lengthy, highly critical, and often vulgar discussion of Palin, focusing on her infamous Katie Couric interview and Oprah appearance.  A caller, Dan from Tennessee, challenged their negative portrayal, arguing they unfairly targeted Palin while ignoring President Obama.  This led to a heated debate about both politicians' qualifications and actions, with the hosts maintaining their criticism of Palin while acknowledging their criticism of Obama extended to Obama as well.  The discussion covered the 2008 election, McCain's choice of Palin, and the hosts' frustrations with politics and media coverage of Palin.  Several audio clips from Palin's Oprah interview were played, and the conversation touched upon abortion and her son Levi Johnston's media appearances. A previous contentious, yet humorous, studio guest interaction was also referenced. The segment concluded with further discussion of Palin and her political future.

The next segment heavily featured a disastrous political ad for Paul R. Nelson, a congressional candidate who lost by a landslide.  The hosts dissected the ad's inflammatory and inaccurate claims about his opponent, Ron Kind, focusing on its accusations of Kind voting to allow illegal immigrants to burn the American flag and highlighting alleged frivolous government spending on sex studies.  They found the ad both wildly effective and hilarious in its hyperbole.  The segment also discussed Sarah Palin's book tour, contrasting her actions with Joe Biden's career, and criticized her for leaving her governorship.  Further discussion included George Lopez's comments on Palin's book, opinions on Wanda Sykes' show and crew member Keith Robinson, the hosts' endorsement of (and amusement at the failure of) Paul R. Nelson's campaign, and their frustration with Sirius XM's underrepresentation of their channel on their website, leading to a discussion of marketing and branding strategies. Other topics included their opinions on the "Precious" movie trailer, a recurring bit about the "word of the year" ("unfriend"), their reaction to a court decision regarding the Washington Redskins' name,  recurring jokes about Danny's malfunctioning computer, and a brief mention of a planned "Shit Radio" segment.  The segment was marked by highly vulgar language, interruptions, and a fast-paced discussion style, with no guests in studio besides the regular hosts and co-hosts, except for a brief interaction with a producer named Steve.


A phone conversation with Boston sports radio hosts Toucher and Rich followed.  The discussion started with the changing of sports team names due to perceived offensiveness (Syracuse Orangemen to Syracuse Orange), debating childhood nostalgia versus sensitivity.  The conversation then shifted to Allen Iverson, Boston traffic, Toucher's upcoming stand-up shows, and the evolution of Toucher and Rich's show, including initial criticism and their studio setup (including a "sports nerd").  They compared themselves to "cockroaches" surviving in a difficult market and promoted Jim Norton's shows.  A significant portion focused on their experiences with promoter Bill Blumenreich, detailing his frustrating scheduling practices and unprofessional behavior.  They discussed changes to their studio, their opinions on Boston sports teams and the Yankees' World Series win, and compared different sports, highlighting basketball players' often-thuggish behavior.  A lengthy discussion of their friend Colin Quinn included anecdotes about Quinn's aversion to alcohol, a snowball incident with Bob Levy, and numerous stories about Bob Levy, who was present in studio, and Rich Voss's frequent mispronunciations and general stupidity.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Steve Martin movies, and a reiteration of the snowball incident.


A rambling conversation with Colin Quinn, Bob Levy (in-studio), and a phone call from Rich Voss followed.  The discussion began with a story about a post-show brawl in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  A critique of Steve Martin movies ensued, with varying opinions on several of his films.  Voss's phone call led to a humorous anecdote about Voss potentially believing Jimmy (likely Jimmy Norton) had sex with his ex-wife, with speculation and jokes about the alleged event. Voss's car troubles (needing a rental for an oil change) were also discussed.  The conversation shifted to Colin Quinn's recent stand-up show, and then to Bob Levy’s personal life, focusing on his multiple marriages, divorces, legal battles, and financial and emotional fallout, using explicit language and details about his ex-wives. Levy recounted stories of fights he'd been in, including one at an Ellis Mania event. The segment concluded with promotional announcements.

The final segment began with a discussion of Opie's boxing training with "Kenny," a brutal trainer, and a recounting of a fight with Boomer Esiason resulting in a broken arm,  followed by vulgar descriptions of a gym's locker attendant. The main focus then shifted to the "Shit Radio" segment, dissecting a disastrous radio promotion from 92.3 Now involving the theft of $10,000.  Audio clips showcased the poor acting and writing of the on-air personalities involved, who attempted to create a "fugitive" storyline. The hosts mocked their poor handling of the situation, focusing on the on-air personalities' dramatic reactions and the implausibility of the scheme.  The hosts speculated on the identity of the "fugitive," suggesting "Chunky" as a likely suspect and making numerous sexually suggestive and offensive comments.  Bob Levy and Sam contributed to the discussion, with Sam providing the audio.  Other 92.3 Now personalities like Tic Tac and Lisa Page were mentioned.

A final segment focused on the developing story of the station employee who stole the money, focusing heavily on "Chunky," with numerous crude jokes about his alleged bowel movements.  The hosts discussed the unfolding events with humor and exasperation, recounting the investigation and the suspect's defiant behavior, imagining his internal monologue.  The narrative covered several weeks of the ongoing story, mocking the alleged drama and lack of public attention, comparing it to radio antics of previous generations.  Bob Levy, in studio, received praise for his performance, and the hosts promoted his upcoming shows, offering more information about the missing money situation through their website.  The segment concluded with the hosts expressing cynicism and a need for extra money as the holiday season approached.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviance.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  What's up, motherfuckers?  I got my little headphones on.  We're broadcasting officially, yes.  Man, we're just talking amongst ourselves.  Is it among ourselves or amongst?  Amongst.  Amongst ourselves.  I don't know.  Among us did.  Ken Ober died, man.  He was a really cool guy.  He worked on Tough Crowd.  He was Colin's head writer.  And he was a really funny guy, man. 
[00:01:30]  Really funny guy.  He was very dark.  Funny, like humor-wise.  Really funny.  A lot of people obviously know him from remote control.  Right.  If you're a little older.  Yeah.  But then after that show, he became a really good producer.  We knew his wife.  We worked with her at WNAW.  Sue Kalinske.  Yeah.  From the Mason and Kalinske morning show.  Right.  That three people listened to.  Right.  Well, I mean, she was, you know.  Thank God somebody else came in to make it better.  Hey, man, man, man, man.  She was nice, though. 
[00:02:00]  And Ken Ober was just a really nice guy.  Yeah.  And yesterday, rumors spread that he was dead.  And then another rumor spread that it was a hoax.  Because that's the big thing with Twitter and everything else is to make believe someone's dead.  And then later in the afternoon, it was confirmed that, yeah, Ken Ober indeed did pass away at the age of 52.  Gee.  Colin Quinn knows him very well.  And Colin was just in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I found out.  I was actually at Red Eye last night.  And I read the at mentions on Twitter.  And someone's like, yeah, it's confirmed.  Ken Ober died. 
[00:02:30]  I'm like, Jesus.  I hadn't heard any of it.  Right.  So I went on and looked it up online a little bit.  And then I went down the cell to get my spot and saw Colin.  He's got to be bummed, obviously.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, very bummed.  And they're saying possibly a heart attack.  Yeah, I think they have to do an autopsy.  You know, who knows?  It could have been depression or it may have been.  Just hard.  And after Remote Control, he did Mind of Mencia.  He did Tough Crowd.  And he was doing The New Adventures of Old Christina, whatever the hell that show is called.  I was actually wondering what he was doing.  Yeah, he was doing that, too. 
[00:03:00]  It's funny.  When I was talking to somebody about possibly pitching a show for me, it was about a year  ago, and that was the first guy I thought of as a possible showrunner.  He was a funny dude, man.  Right, right.  He really wrote some dark, funny shit.  Real nice guy, too, man.  Real nice guy.  That just sucks.  Yes, it does.  That just bums you out.  You're kidding.  And then someone associated with our show also died.  Well, not one of 20 people we would put on the list first.  Well, no, she did the show more than once.  Yeah.  She used to come up here with Dennis Hoff from the Bunny Ranch, right. 
[00:03:30]  One of the Cat House girls died a couple days ago.  What's her name?  Brooke Phillips, right?  Yeah.  And what a horrendous situation that was.  I'm hearing she was pregnant, shot, and burned alive.  What the fuck?  Or her house was burned down after she was shot, and she was pregnant.  There's some crazy-ass people out there.  What the hell is that about?  I mean, you can only speculate that it's a jealous or crazed ex. 
[00:04:00]  At this?  That's a, no one, no one just sets a pregnant woman on fire.  Yeah, and she was really, really cool.  Yeah, she was.  We're trying to remember if she was.  Was that the girl that was from Oklahoma?  I don't remember.  She used to come to the cellar with Dennis.  So she was shot and found in her house in Oklahoma City.  And I'm kind of remembering her.  Yeah.  Well, you remember her face, don't you?  Yeah, yeah.  Now that I look at her.  Yeah, she's a very distinct face.  She was very, she was beautiful.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  So, damn.  Last time, man.  That's a hell of a way to start another radio show, but there you go.  Yeah, I think he was actually dating her.  He's dead until he's flying one of the girls and date him.  Like, you know, like, and that was a girl that he talked about a lot and was associated with a lot.  That may have been his kind of girlfriend for quite a while.  Well, I think you were seeing the other one that came up.  Oh.  That had short hair.  She actually had long hair when she came up.  We're looking at a picture of her with short hair.  I forgot her name.  She's the one that went on all the TV talk shows with Dennis Hoff. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  It just sucks.  That's what that's about.  Yeah, there's some anger there, huh?  Get the forensic files people in.  A young woman found shot and burned.  And they send the investigators in and they find fucking hair.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And yes, we did lose the equalizer as well.  Yeah.  Who's the equalizer? 
[00:05:30]  I forgot his name.  I forgot the actor's name.  Do we have this really?  I'm done.  Did you watch the equalizer?  No.  The equalizers did.  When was that show around?  In the 80s?  The equalizer?  Who was it?  I forget his fucking name.  He was a bit older.  I think he was like 78 or 79.  Was it Edward Woodward?  Edward Woodward.  Very good.  What a dumb name to have.  I believe that was his name.  Yeah.  Your name is Woodward.  The equalizer.  I don't have to be Edward Woodward.  Edward Woodward. 
[00:06:00]  I don't think I ever saw the show, to be honest with you.  Did you ever see the equalizer, eh?  No.  Hell no.  I don't think I did.  I need to see a picture of the guy to even know who the fuck he is.  Yeah.  Edward Woodward.  Who's, uh...  Wood.  Let's go to Wes.  Wes the Trekker.  Wes!  Obi, man.  I hate to keep bringing this up, but it was your words, man.  Year of the Celebrity Death.  Oh, 2009.  The Year of the Celebrity Death continues.  We had a little break in the action there.  That's going to be a long fucking segment on the Academy Awards. 
[00:06:30]  But it seems like, uh, it's back.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy?  Eh, well, maybe.  You remember him?  Well, he was in other things besides being the equalizer, right?  He was all there.  Hey, do you know Kevin Knox, Jimmy?  He's a comedian from Boston.  Well, he was.  He was a comedian from Boston.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I was kidding, really?  Kevin from Connecticut and a few others saying, uh, Kevin Knox, huge comedy figure in Boston,  Boston died.  Wow. 
[00:07:00]  I didn't.  Of the big C, I believe.  I didn't.  I didn't know Kevin.  When did he die?  I heard nothing but good things about him.  Obviously, very recently, because everyone is, uh, writing that on Instant Feedback right now.  Can I see a picture of Kevin Knox?  Yeah, I've been hearing his name for almost my whole career.  Really?  A lot of those Boston guys, like, I never worked with him or Steve Sweeney or, uh, Don Gavin  and I only met once, but they're all.  Sweeney?  Like, legendary comics in Boston.  I love Steve Sweeney.  I fucking love that guy.  He was one of the guys I competed with for, uh, the part of Rich.  He was one of the final three guys on Lucky Louie.  Oh, no kidding. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It was me, him, and one other guy, and it was just, uh, he was totally different than  I was, so they just...  Steve Sweeney has the best local fucking comedy actor of all time.  Yeah, he's supposed to be great.  I mean, his Boston material is just solid.  Kevin Knox.  You know who I hate?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy Tingle.  Fuck, I remember him.  You were going to say Norton.  Oh, no, no.  I love Jimmy Norton.  I hate Jimmy Tingle.  You never liked him?  He's a Boston guy.  You saw him a couple times up there in Boston, right?  I saw him once.  I was dragged to see him.  Just a fucking, uh, God, not one of these liberal comics. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Shitty.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to 33 Across from Pennsylvania.  33 Across.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, uh, you guys, Anthony might remember, uh, Edward Woodward.  He was in a movie called Breaker Morant.  Oh, yeah.  Australia.  And, uh, it was a great movie.  And the guy from Cocktail was in it, too.  I forget his name.  Yeah, that fucking Limey.  What, the older guy in Cocktail? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, uh, like Tom Cruise's, like, uh...  Mentor?  Tom Cruise's mentor, the guy who's going to teach him how to make cocktails?  How to spin bottles.  Right, like, that movie sucked.  Did you like Cocktail?  Uh, no.  I didn't like Cocktail.  I'm like, why are they taking bartending so seriously?  Dan, Dan, you've got to flip your bottles.  You've got to fucking...  Shut up, come on, stop it.  I liked my years as a bartender, but I didn't take it seriously.  I wasn't hoping to go on the bartending circuit.  I'd rather go on the bouncer circuit. 
[00:09:00]  Right, exactly.  Uh, Danny, did you, uh, do any of that, uh, flair, flash type of bartending?  No, they did.  Actually, it's funny, because, uh, when, uh, before I started bartending, I didn't know  what I was doing.  So I actually attended one of those, you know, $300, two-week bartending schools.  Ah, you're one of those guys.  And, and, and, like, in the lobby, like, before you go for your first, like, orientation, you  got to sit in this little waiting area, like a doctor's office.  Right.  And, uh, guess what they're playing in there?  Hey, Cocktail!  Because they're trying to show you, like, this is what it could be like, man. 
[00:09:30]  Are you serious?  Oh, my God.  Look at them, they're dancing and flipping bottles to each other.  Well, yeah.  And everyone's psyched, like, they're watching them.  Look at them, yeah, look at them throwing it back and forth.  Holy shit, what a great movie.  They are rocking, man.  Oh, Cocktail was fantastic.  Oh, I am Flanagan.  I am Flanagan.  Just give me my drink.  Stop with the showmanship.  And he would laugh, Tom Cruise would laugh, but you couldn't believe how good the guy was.  Oh, yeah, he was the best.  He was the best. 
[00:10:00]  Throw the drink.  Right.  And then the guy did exactly what the audience wanted to do by the end of it.  Oh, right.  He dropped dead, right?  I forgot about that.  Oh, he killed himself, right.  Oh, you're in Flanagan.  Oh, shut up.  Enough of you and your dumb cocktails.  What else is going on?  Let's say hi to Garth in Indiana.  Oh, he's kidding.  Tom just caught it.  He's got the tie on.  There he is.  Well, he's the man.  He's the main bartender.  Look at him.  He's dancing, dude.  The other guy's putting the bottle down behind his back.  Chicks are looking at him. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Digging him with the big 80s hair.  Oh, he's dancing.  Oh, he's dancing.  Look at him.  He's spinning around.  Get me my drink.  Who would like this?  Oh, they crank the music up even louder.  Oh, no way.  He's dancing instead of making drinks.  Great.  I'm trying to listen to the... 
[00:11:00]  Serious fuck me eyes coming over here.  Oh, yeah.  It's my information.  Your old man's coming in right behind him.  Oh, he's spinning around.  Hey.  Oh, he's spinning around.  I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape,  but my supposed fiancé keeps...  There's something babbling in my ear.  I love that scene.  Let's go to Garth in Indiana.  Garth.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Garth.  Hey, last time I was watching George Lopez's new Lake show, 
[00:11:30]  and he's pretty pissed off.  He called Sir and Palin's new book a piece of shit,  and it was pretty funny because the TVS didn't censor it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was refreshing.  Could the guys get that clip?  I would love to hear that, man.  They are cable.  They're not bound by the same FCC rules.  Yeah.  Cable self-polices.  Like, you technically could say anything you want on any cable show.  They're just afraid of advertisers pulling out and stuff like that.  It has nothing to do with getting fined. 
[00:12:00]  Well, good for him, man.  Because Sarah Palin's book has to be a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Why are we taking her seriously still?  I was able to catch a bit of her on Oprah.  Okay, I got a couple clips for everybody today.  And she just came off as stupid as she did during the election.  I mean, they played a clip of that Katie Couric interview  where she's walking with Katie, and Katie goes,  so what newspapers do you read?  Right. 
[00:12:30]  And she did not.  She goes, oh, all of them.  All of them.  Oh, all of them.  You read everything.  And she's like, no, what do you read?  Like, well, no, a lot of different things.  Well, name one, Katie goes.  She's like, oh, there's just so many.  It got into this big thing where she looked like an idiot  because she couldn't name one newspaper.  Just say USA Today, and it would have been fine.  Right, and then she tries to spin it and say that she was caught off guard.  She said she was caught off guard.  We've all been caught off guard in our lives,  but when it comes to what's your favorite newspaper, 
[00:13:00]  that's pretty fucking easy.  Who played center for the Cowboys in 88?  Right, right, right.  Exactly.  Right, exactly.  Now her excuse was that she was already kind of in a tiff with Katie  and wasn't going to answer her stupid question that she said,  she interpreted as, oh, so you live up in the middle of nowhere,  you're uneducated, why don't you tell us if you read or not? 
[00:13:30]  It wasn't presented that way.  So why didn't she say that?  Prove her wrong.  She did say it on Oprah.  Well, that's too late.  Too late, right.  She should have said it to Katie, like, what, do you think I'm dumb  because I live in Alaska?  That would have been cool.  I would have appreciated that a little bit.  But no, she sat there going,  Well, let's listen to Sarah talk to Oprah.  Obviously, you've read books and magazines.  Why didn't you just name some books or magazines?  Well, and obviously, I have, of course, all my life. 
[00:14:00]  I'm a lover of books and magazines.  Oh, please tell me Oprah goes to name your favorite book.  Name one.  Please tell me she said that.  I'm a lover of books and magazines.  No one says that.  Just shit pours out of this broad's mouth.  Just fucking say something.  This isn't a Republican-Democrat thing.  No.  Just an observation.  I'm a Republican.  Shit falls out of this fucking lady's mouth.  I want her to just go away.  You do, right? 
[00:14:30]  She's a bane on the Republican Party.  She's saying she didn't cost him the election,  but she really did.  Even with her, McCain was such a likable guy  that it was a close election to a powerful figure like Obama.  People just could not, because of his age,  people were afraid, what if he dies?  This is the president.  And that had to be considered with an older guy.  It was a weird time to take a chance with a woman,  to be honest with you.  If McCain went with a young Republican,  I couldn't name one.  Maybe I could.  Yeah, it would have been.  Then I think it would have been a hell of a lot fucking closer, man. 
[00:15:00]  With somebody like Hillary, who, like her or don't like her,  at least you don't think she's a complete blithering idiot, yeah.  I love that word when you use it.  She's a blithering.  Blithering is one of my favorite Jim Norton words.  Blithering idiot.  You wouldn't look at Hillary and,  oh my God, she'll get us all killed.  You know what I mean?  Even though you don't like her, you wouldn't.  It was a weird move.  It really was.  I think it was a bad miscalculation by the Republicans.  They're like, well, this is the answer for the women,  because Hillary's got all the votes.  Yeah, a prop vice president.  A gag.  But how out of touch were they that they didn't see all this 
[00:15:30]  before they announced that she was McCain's running mate?  I know.  That's exactly it.  Magazines and newspapers.  By the time she asked me that question,  even though it was kind of early on in the interview,  I was already so annoyed,  and it was very unprofessional of me to wear that annoyance on my sleeve.  Was it that you couldn't think of any in the moment?  No, it was more like, are you kidding me?  Are you really asking me?  To me, it was in the context of, do you read?  How do you stay informed?  You're way up there.  Or it seemed like she was discovering this nomadic tribe, 
[00:16:00]  a member of a tribe from some Neanderthal cave in Alaska,  asking me, how do you stay in touch with the real world?  That's how I took the question.  So I kind of, well, didn't kind of, I did.  I rolled my eyes and was annoyed with the question and thought,  you know, I think that this is a problem with the state of journalism today  is no matter what I say to her,  it will probably be twisted, perceived as a bit negative.  No, I'm not saying anything.  It was the worst thing she could have done.  You could have just said anything. 
[00:16:30]  Like I said, oh, well, USA Today, I read that.  I read our local papers up there,  the fucking Anchorage fucking whale blubber.  Yeah.  You know, come out with something.  Well, and it's easy to come up with an answer now, what?  A year later.  Yeah.  We're up to a year later, right?  So easy to now explain why you look like a complete idiot.  And did freaking Oprah go after her?  No, no.  Oprah didn't skew her?  No, this was kind of a softball interview. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, what's Oprah doing?  Yeah.  What is she doing?  She asked her some questions about things that happened during the campaign,  but didn't really.  She wasn't nailing her at this point.  Did she nail her after that answer?  No, not really.  She just let her go?  Yeah, she let her off the hook.  Ask her about what kind of books she reads.  Oprah has the book club.  It's a natural thing.  You know what I've heard Palin say, and I believe this,  that she thought Katie was a fan.  She's got some weird shit with McCain's aides. 
[00:17:30]  She thought that they had informed her that Katie was a fan of hers.  You know, a woman and a woman, you know.  So she went into the interview thinking she was going to get a pretty good  or comfortable interview.  Yeah.  And I think what caught her off guard was the fact that Katie Court was not a fan  and that came after her.  She just got caught off guard completely.  By that point in the interview, she probably was feeling beat up,  but she got caught off guard.  Yeah.  When you're running for vice president and they ask you a softball question,  like what magazines do you read?  Throw out Time, Newsweek.  Because Newsweek tends to be more conservative. 
[00:18:00]  Time tends to cover them both.  Right, right.  Time, Newsweek, New York Times.  Right.  American Rifleman.  Anything.  Black Inches.  Fucking Goofers and Gallants.  Anything.  Biggums?  Biggums?  Yeah, biggums, of course.  All right.  Like the biggums.  Let's go to Dan in Tennessee.  Of course, this has to be said, I guess.  Right, Dan?  Right, Dan?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was just going to say, you know,  I noticed y'all like Trash and Sarah Palin.  I understand the show and everything, 
[00:18:30]  but it sounds like y'all legitimately think that she's just completely dumb.  But what about Obama?  Like, mentioning that...  Holy shit, Anne expresses how dumb Obama is on a regular basis.  Trust me, okay?  Dan?  What's the problem?  And I never say Obama's dumb.  He's very calculating.  And he's...  I don't like him at all as far as being the president goes.  But Palin...  Sarah Palin's more experienced.  Oh my God, this is why I can't do politics on this.  But there's no way I would want to see Sarah Palin as the president of the United States. 
[00:19:00]  I'm sorry.  And we don't have an agenda, Dan.  Sarah Palin is as dumb as they come.  She is a dummy.  But it's not.  She is a dummy.  But dude, it's not...  Honestly, Dan...  We're in Alaska with a profit, almost.  Dan, it's not...  I mean, you'll lose.  She's not fucking a wasteland with oil in it.  Exactly.  I can...  Who's her competition?  Exactly.  She beat a polar bear.  Right.  Dan, here's the problem. 
[00:19:30]  It's not even a neighboring state to compete with.  She's not dumb on a scale of...  Oh, she's an incompetent idiot.  But on a scale of national politics, she didn't handle herself well.  She did not...  Hold on, Dan.  She did not...  I don't always attack Republicans.  I defend Republicans a lot.  In this case, I think that calling her an idiot or unqualified for that office was justified.  I don't think that she held up well.  And if you're the president and you can't hold up to Katie Couric, then you're not qualified. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, how the fuck are you going to hold up to the world leaders?  We'll get to Obama!  I'm not saying...  We're not talking about Obama right now.  We're talking about how stupid Sarah Palin is.  Sarah Palin is a dummy.  But Dan, it's not about saying that Obama hasn't made mistakes or said dumb things.  Everyone says dumb things.  No one is saying that Palin said one...  Hold on, Dan.  No, no, dude.  Hold on.  You just spoke your piece.  Now, listen.  It's not fair.  No one is saying that she can't say something dumb or do one dumb thing. 
[00:20:30]  But it was a series of them, and we all watched it unfold.  Right.  I liked John McCain, and I really rooted for Obama when she came on.  And I gave her a chance because the media does sway very liberal.  They do attack the conservatives.  Very much.  What's that?  He said very much.  Yeah, absolutely.  I agree with that.  So I did want to give her a shot, and I liked her at first.  And the more I watched her, I wasn't convinced by Katie Couric.  Time after time, I just was like, this is not the person I want.  In the debates, I did not think that she held up well in the debates. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, but look at Obama.  Obama has no experience at anything.  At least he has experience running a state and balancing a budget.  We're not talking about Obama right now.  People are asking if this is the first time you've ever listened to the show.  Is this the first time you've ever listened to this program?  Trust me, Obama gets a lot of attention on this show, Dan.  You should maybe listen a little longer.  I got to go because they're fucking driving me nuts.  What?  What? 
[00:21:30]  He doesn't?  He doesn't what?  Get attention on this show.  Obama doesn't get attention on this show.  Really?  I don't think that guy has ever listened to the show.  Really?  People yell and scream that the other side isn't represented better.  God, for one second, we start talking about Palin.  Believe me, I probably agree with 100% of what that guy's got to say about Obama.  Don't worry about it so much.  We're just fucking getting on.  Because Sarah Palin was on Oprah, we're talking about her.  If Obama was on Oprah, we'd be talking about him. 
[00:22:00]  But it's amazing how a guy...  Don't worry.  Within an hour, we'll be talking about Obama again.  I'm sure.  How a guy can listen and be so partisan.  Dude, you're...  Yeah, yeah.  No, I hung up...  I'll be honest.  I hung up on him today.  You're so...  Dan, you're so...  I'm in the mood for his being.  You're so much one party...  Yeah.  ...that you're like...  We're bashing Palin.  And you're like, what about Obama?  How about you look at one thing at a time?  She fucked up the election for the Republicans.  Whether you like it or not, that's...  I'm telling you, that's what swayed me.  I was...  What do you think?  I didn't want... 
[00:22:30]  I mean, I kind of wanted a black president.  But I didn't...  I was a little nervous when I was a very liberal Democrat.  I was nervous about that for tax reasons.  And there was definitely a reason to be nervous, as we see.  I still would have taken him over McCain and Palin, though.  Honestly.  The religious influence...  That was another thing that bothered me about her.  She was way too religious, dude.  She was way too religious.  I can't have another one.  McCain, moderate.  So much so that Russian, those guys, want him out of the party.  And culture, they want him out of the party, because he's such a moderate Republican. 
[00:23:00]  That's why I liked him.  I want a fucking religious vice president.  I'm sick of it.  I'm tired of the fucking religious conservatives.  Fuck off.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that whole religion and politics thing.  Enough.  Beat it.  Leave the gays alone.  Fucking do something.  I don't...  You know something?  I don't care about that whole gay issue.  That, to me, is like such a...  It does not affect me enough where I would vote for or against a candidate based on their  gay marriage stance.  And not because you're a religious nut. 
[00:23:30]  If you're a religious nut and you're against gay marriage, it's not because of your gay  marriage stance.  It's because you're a religious nut.  If somebody just says, you know, here's my platform.  And I go, wow, I kind of like that platform.  And they go, and I don't want gays to get married.  I'd be like, I'll vote for the fucking guy.  Because I could give a shit if gays could get married or not.  It's not affecting me.  I vote for what affects me.  But it doesn't bother you that they are getting married.  No.  And if there's a candidate...  I could care less.  If there's a candidate that's great in all the things I like, and he says, and I'm for  gay marriage, I'll vote for him anyway. 
[00:24:00]  That's not going to be any swaying point for me, is the gay marriage thing.  And that's what I hate when they bring into the debates and things like that as such  an important thing.  Now, the gays, it's very important.  So vote accordingly.  If you're gay.  Me?  I'm a fucking taxpayer in a bracket that they're killing me, so I'm going to vote accordingly  that way.  And Mangano in Nassau County is pulling ahead now of Swazi as they start counting the votes.  And that's good news for you, right?  And it's a Republican.  Right.  He wants less taxes. 
[00:24:30]  He wants to cut the government out of our lives a little more.  And it's showing.  It's showing.  And now this Swazi, who thought he'd just fucking waltz into another term, is looking like he's  going to get his ass thrown out for a Republican.  Good.  Makes me feel good that I went out and voted during a very off election year.  But they're separated by 500 or some odd votes.  And when you live in a county like I live in where we've been taxed to death, there  was a special fucking clicky lever in the voting booth just for fucking against the taxes. 
[00:25:00]  It's like fucking people that are against taxes pull this and it's everybody that wants  to fucking lower taxes and get.  And they made it easy.  For those people, you know, I pick and choose each one.  But your vote didn't matter.  Because he would have won by 499 votes.  That's 499 votes.  No, I know.  You know what it is, though?  And this is...  It's probably...  There were probably about five...  Who knows?  A thousand people like yourself that said, you know what?  I need to vote this time around. 
[00:25:30]  There were enough people annoyed at the situation.  And I was one of them.  That said, you know something?  I'm going to get out and vote this time around.  And it's not that many people.  You know, when you're considering there's hundreds of thousands of votes and they're  separated by 500 or some odd votes, it's not a lot of people.  And it was enough people that were pissed off and done with this whole just reaching their  hands in your pocket to say, go fuck yourself.  Right.  Cut some of the shit on your end. 
[00:26:00]  And maybe, you know, you could get your budget in line that way.  Dan, what the fuck do you want?  Oh, Dan.  Oh, Dan.  Look, I think...  What the fuck do you want?  First of all, answer this question.  Because now you called back.  So now you're going to have to deal with some shit.  Do you listen to this show or not?  Do you listen to this show or not?  I listen to it all the time.  Dan, do you hear...  Do you hear Anthony talk about Obama or not?  I never said that you didn't talk about Obama. 
[00:26:30]  My point is that Sarah Palin, what I think would be at least 10 times better than this  president, however...  We're not making that argument right now.  She was on Oprah and she's a dummy and we're expressing that today.  What are you, in love with Sarah Palin?  You want to fucking have sex with Sarah Palin?  You fucking cuckold.  When she ran the fucking state to perfection.  Well, good for her.  It's a fucking Alaska.  She would get her ass kicked as a president. 
[00:27:00]  Here, have some rock salt.  Have some blubber.  You, quit fucking that seal.  You know, come on.  It's Alaska.  Hey, Dan, let me ask you a question.  Are you really...  Are you a pretty hardcore Republican guy?  No, I'm not.  I was okay.  I was okay with a...  Oh, I hate this guy.  I think McCain sucks on immigration and stuff.  I really wasn't that wild about McCain, but he was better than, you know, pretty much  anybody else.  Well, we just don't agree with you.  Like, I don't agree with you that she would have been better.  And I kind of looked at all things. 
[00:27:30]  Look, this is what politics are.  And this is where you can't get frustrated.  If he, like, examines Palin and examines Obama and we do the same thing, we just come to  different conclusions.  I mean, sometimes that really is all it is.  Like, I think that I'm informed of the issues.  I just...  I did not feel comfortable with her.  But my point is, we're not even arguing.  We're just...  We're just...  Oh, I don't feel like doing this today.  I feel more comfortable with him than her.  I feel more comfortable with him than her.  But not by much, if you want to be honest.  That just shows how unbelievably unqualified you already even talked politics if you think 
[00:28:00]  Biden would be better president than her.  Yes, I do.  Yeah, I think Biden has a lot more experience than Sarah Palin on the national stage, you  fucking dummy.  I don't need to fucking read a lot of political books to know that, you douche.  Dan, go away.  Wait, Dan, do you really think that Biden's not his experience?  Let him keep calling fucking back.  What is he, stupid? 
[00:28:30]  Biden's been in Washington for what?  Yeah, of course he has.  I don't even know how many decades.  Of course he has.  Yeah, he's got a bunch of experience.  He's also got a bit more foreign policy experience, Dan, if you're listening.  So as far as not being qualified to talk politics, if you really think that you're more comfortable  with Sarah Palin dealing with foreign policy, then good for you.  You know, it's like you can't look at Sarah Palin running Alaska.  And it sounds like a joke, like, oh, it's Alaska.  But it is.  It's Alaska.  The population, as compared to the square miles of Alaska, is inconsequential. 
[00:29:00]  The resources they have there, the tax money they get from oil into their economy is stunning.  So she looks, you know, she looks like she's run the country well, the country, the state well.  Well, and my biggest problem, and hence the anger, I'm so frustrated by the media and how 
[00:29:30]  they handle this Sarah Palin.  She's a joke.  And look at the Oprah over here.  Well, Oprah's just being that fluff show.  The press ripped apart.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oprah was not a fluff show for many, many years.  You know, she beat the shit out of that author because, you know, he exaggerated his book.  And she has a history of going after a guest hard.  And she let Sarah Palin off the hook with this whole explanation about the newspapers.  You know, and Sarah has had a year to think about a good answer now. 
[00:30:00]  It was a fluff piece for a book.  It wasn't like we're trying to expose you as a candidate.  That's why she did that.  The press.  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  No, I understand what you're going to say.  But she went on a lot of shows.  I understand what you're going to say.  I know there's people out there beating the shit out of her like we are.  But one-on-one interviews, who's going after her?  That's what I need to know today.  Oprah didn't do it.  Katie did.  Well, a year ago.  I'm talking about now that everyone knows that she was a joke in this election. 
[00:30:30]  Well, that's just it.  It's like, unless you could pull something out of her book now and rip her on that,  it's almost like you're kicking a dead horse if you go after her about election issues.  I would openly laugh at her if she was on our show.  Like, I would want to know things like, how was it working with McCain knowing that he didn't like you?  Knowing that the people in the party didn't like you and the people running the campaign didn't like you? 
[00:31:00]  I wonder who made that decision, though, because I didn't realize they didn't like each other.  They couldn't stand each other.  It was amazing.  You know, and the obvious thing, and I'll let Westy say it, yes, this is a very good point for Dan,  if he's still listening.  I'm sure he is, and I'm sure he'll call back.  Go ahead, Westy.  Listen to this one.  Yeah.  Look at that dumb fucking idiot up there, Dan.  She couldn't take it as being a governor by the press.  She had to fucking quit.  So what did you think that she's going to do?  Well, she's a fucking president of the United States.  She can't even take pressure of being a governor. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  That is true.  She didn't just quit her post, Dan, you dope.  But that does show true character, that she quit as the governor of Alaska, and she was  going for the presidency?  Well, she had to write this book.  Yeah, because she has other motives.  Yeah, exactly.  She just wants to be famous.  I will say this.  Good for her.  I know people that know Sarah, and I know somebody that's had dinner with her, who doesn't know  her that well.  And it's easy to report third person, but I'm not going to lie about it. 
[00:32:00]  And he just said that she's a vapid idiot.  Yeah.  And all she wants to talk about is the money she got for her book.  Yeah.  Again, that's third person reporting, but...  I don't doubt it.  You know, she did say one thing that made sense.  There was a double standard.  Like, the second the press started kind of digging into...  And it was out of this admiration, love, and fucking hero worship with Obama, digging  into his family, you know, the kids and stuff like that. 
[00:32:30]  And Obama turned around and said, look, please give my family privacy during this, and leave  my kids alone, and stuff like that.  And the press fucking laid off.  Laid off.  And with Sarah Palin, she brought that up on Oprah, too.  They ganged up on her family.  And believe me, there was plenty of good stories there, with the daughter getting pregnant,  and then the friggin' potential son-in-law, who's just a tool. 
[00:33:00]  Well, he's not just a tool.  He's posing for playgirl.  Yeah, yeah.  He just wants to be one of those fucking TMZ fucking stars.  She had the worst line, too, because she was saying his name is Levi, I think, and she  goes, or his new name, Robbie Hollywood.  Oh.  She made that up.  Can we play more of this audio?  Please.  Robbie Hollywood.  We've got more Sarah Palin audio from Oprah.  I talk a lot about the Katie Couric interview in the book, because I want the transcript,  too, to speak for itself, to show that she asked me 12 different times my position on 
[00:33:30]  abortion and the morning after pill.  She did not want, I guess, to hear my first candid, truthful response about being pro-life  and wanting to usher in a culture of life and empower women to know that they are strong  enough and smart enough to have that child.  I gave my answer, and she asked it again.  I love that tack, too, that the conservatives take on abortion.  It empowers women for the government to tell them they can't do something. 
[00:34:00]  No, it doesn't.  It completely imprisons women to make them have kids.  Enough with the kids.  If you want them, have them.  If you don't, get the old fucking Hoover.  Enough with the kids.  Abortion, that's another issue.  There's a lot of fucking people out there.  What's the big deal?  I know.  Fucking, if they don't want their kids, then fucking, they don't, they shouldn't have  to have their fucking kids.  That's another issue where I just fork off from the conservatives and Republican Party 
[00:34:30]  when it comes to abortion.  Enough with the fucking abortion thing.  It doesn't affect me.  I don't give a shit.  Let the women fucking hack it up.  I don't care.  Shove that thing in.  I'll lick the beaters when it comes back out like a cake.  Enough, though.  Even though the pro-lifers, I hate to say it, morally are probably on the right side of the issue.  If you look at a moral...  Oh, a moral type of thing.  They're probably on the right side of the issue, but I am pro-choice just because I don't 
[00:35:00]  want to knock a girl up and be forced to have it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  There's too many unwanted kids laying around.  Yeah.  It's...  You want more?  Seems very obvious.  At least to me, but...  You know who's having a lot of abortions that if they didn't, boy, there'd be even more.  Yes, we do.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know.  Low-income people.  No, man.  They don't have the abortions.  Yes, they do.  I want to see some stats.  I think it's well-off white girls having more abortions.  No.  Using fucking abortions for fucking... 
[00:35:30]  Hats.  Oh, hats.  Instead of condoms.  Yes.  All right.  More, Sarah.  Levi has been making the press rounds, including Vanity Fair, and has a lot of unflattering  things to say about Sarah Palin and the Palin family.  Levi and Bristol are no longer together.  How do you feel about him today?  Well, I think because so much of the discussion with Levi has to do with his most beautiful 
[00:36:00]  baby boy, Trip, my grandson, and Trip's future.  That I don't think a national television show is the place to discuss some of the things  that he's doing and saying...  And by the way, I don't know if we call him Levi.  I hear he goes by the name Ricky Hollywood now.  So if that's the case, we don't want to mess up this gig he's got going.  Kind of this aspiring...  Aspiring porn.  Some of the things that he's doing.  It's kind of heartbreaking.  The Playgirl, Cinderfall.  Right.  It's... 
[00:36:30]  I call that porn.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You call that porn?  Let me show you a horse video that we were perusing.  Exactly.  I call it beauty.  Why don't you calm down a little bit?  You want to see some porn?  We'll show you some porn.  Oh, fuck yeah.  She stinks.  Oh, she just sounds like...  She really doesn't.  And she doesn't answer questions well.  Candid questions like this.  It just drives me nuts listening to her.  It always has.  Her voice is really annoying. 
[00:37:00]  Her fucking jokes are horrendous.  What did she say?  Ricky Hollywood?  Was she expecting the whole fucking crowd to go nuts?  Like they're at an old school Richard Pryor show?  Raise the roof, yo.  She was expecting that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  She got one dummy to laugh.  Richard Pryor was funny, old fay.  Oh, motherfucking...  Motherfucking...  Motherfucking...  Motherfucker.  Please.  What are you talking about?  Do you have ears?  Yes.  You're putting words in my mouth. 
[00:37:30]  I'm not...  Motherfucking...  People loved it, though.  He was good.  Yeah, the reaction.  He was raving about...  He loved being on the show.  I loved having him on.  Yeah.  Some people were getting mad, but...  Of course.  You had to understand what was going on yesterday.  Oh, the dynamic in here was great.  There was no reason to get mad yesterday.  That was just pure comedy.  I was...  The subject matter was a little intense, but that was just fucking...  When he walked in and first sat down, all I was thinking was, oh, my God, the second  he opens his mouth, I've got to go after this motherfucker.  I've seen him on interviews. 
[00:38:00]  I can't stand what he says and stands for...  And then he starts...  Hold on.  I was trying to get you riled up, too.  I'm like, you're going after him, right, Ant?  I didn't need any riling.  Because I knew that was your fucking thing.  I'm like, you know you've got to go after this guy.  So he starts going off, and we start going at it a little bit, and then I'm looking at  him and going, holy fuck, this guy loves pushing buttons.  Yeah, that's all.  And he knows how to function in society.  Of course he does.  He gets up on stage and tells jokes and makes statements that make people fucking... 
[00:38:30]  That infuriate people, but that's what he does.  And then he's looking, and he's winking and smiling and pulling away from the mic and  pointing at me like, yeah, motherfucker.  Whenever anyone made a good point, that's exactly what he's doing.  He would point at you like...  He'd point at me like, yeah.  And I'm going, I fucking finally understand this guy, and it's brilliant.  His smile, and I've said this before about Mooney, like, he has this amazing ability when  he's on stage to say really harsh stuff. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then he smiles and laughs.  Farrakhan has that, too, as a speaker.  And all of a sudden, the air is just let out of the...  It's an amazing smile the guy has and laughs.  And it's like, it's hard to stay, like, pissed off or to take it seriously.  Yeah, you take it like...  You realize he's having a good time.  You can't take it every letter that he's saying.  You know, you look and realize, okay, he's fucking stirring the pot up, and he's doing  a great job at it.  And because when I was going off on The Whole Black Day, he was like, what are you talking  about?  What are you...  He knew what I was saying. 
[00:39:30]  What are you talking about?  And he looked over at me a few times and started, like, laughing, like, all right.  I hear what you're saying, but I'm just going to fucking stay on...  He stayed right on his track.  He was so excited.  After the show, he was raving about us.  He was like, I got to come back to this show.  These guys pushed the boundaries.  We definitely will have him back.  Yeah, he was great, man.  It was.  It was a lot of fun.  I love that he can't answer the follow-up question.  That's what was amazing to me.  And we called him on it.  That was amazing to me.  He was like, answer the follow-up.  What are you...  You can't just make a statement.  He would make a really good point, and then you would give him the follow-up question. 
[00:40:00]  It's like, now back it up with something.  You heard me.  You heard me.  It's like, what?  No!  Back it up!  And I fucking looked him up yesterday after the show.  That guy's pushing 70?  Yeah, I know.  We were looking at a 70-year-old.  Is he really?  He's 68, 69.  That's fucking amazing.  If that age is even real.  Yeah, that guy looks like he's in his 50s.  41.  At most.  Yeah, 41 to...  That's right, 59.  Yeah.  He is 68.  Wow.  So he's been through some shit.  That's like...  See, that's another thing.  He doesn't look that age. 
[00:40:30]  So I kept thinking, like, all right, he's fucking grabbing at shit that's a lot older  than him.  He shouldn't take that personally.  All right, he was the whites-only fountain, blacks, but you can't sit at the fucking lunch  counter.  He was that guy.  He saw a hoser, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Saw a fire hose and a German shepherd, too.  Of course he did.  Yeah, you don't remember.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we were insulted by that, but all right, yeah.  Yeah, he's way older than us.  Yeah.  Not that we're fucking spring chickens anymore, but he's way older than us. 
[00:41:00]  He was...  No, I...  For the record, I think it was a lot of fun.  He was a funny guy and had a great time having him in.  I did, too.  Yeah, we got to get some kind of visual element to the show, because I popped on my flip for  a little bit, but it doesn't do the segment justice.  It was great, though, man.  And then during commercials, I guess everybody left the studio, and me and him were just  talking, and yeah, it was a whole thing.  I go, you just...  You motherfucker.  You nailed me.  You push buttons.  You know exactly what you're doing. 
[00:41:30]  And he just starts laughing, and he points at me and winks and goes, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Like, he knew.  That's what he does.  I think he's also...  Oh, shithouse rat crazy.  All right, good.  At least you know that.  He's nuts.  I don't think even he would deny that.  No.  You don't spend fucking 30 years around Pryor's drug use and just come out of it emotionally  healthy.  It doesn't happen.  All right, so that was good.  Let's get back on the road here.  So, Sarah on Oprah, more on this Levi Johnson, I guess.  This is what I want to know.  What happens when he comes to see the baby? 
[00:42:00]  He's quite busy with his media tours, and he hasn't seen the baby for a while, but we  will let that be the discussion between Bristol and Levi as they work out.  Their relationship, because Levi forever will be the father of this most beautiful baby,  and I continue to hope for the best and to pray for Levi.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Good for you.  That's right.  A lot of praying.  Could you pray for...  Well...  Not a peep. 
[00:42:30]  I'll show you how good prayer can be sometimes.  Yes, sometimes prayer backfires, doesn't it?  Play for a Cadillac and you get an Edsel with three wheels.  Oh, my God.  Shit, man.  That praying is a weird thing, isn't it?  Oh, it certainly is.  Let's go to Alan in the Bronx.  Alan.  What do you say, Al?  Okay.  What's your call?  Jesus. 
[00:43:00]  Is that there?  Yeah.  I'm right here just trying to have some fun.  Fucking Opie, man.  I turn on my radio and all I hear is Sarah bashing Sarah bashing Sarah.  But all you guys ever do, except for Anthony, is tote Obama, man.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You know how hard it is for me to sit here with these two liberal pantyways?  You're absolutely right, sir.  Thank you.  I commend you.  Nope.  I commend you.  I would not vote for that dumb twat, but all everybody does is try to slam her to make 
[00:43:30]  her out to be such an idiot.  Jimmy, I know somebody who says she's a fucking idiot.  Good Jimmy impression.  Wow.  All I ever hear is what a fucking idiot Sarah is, but nobody talks about the lies of Obama,  the bullshit that's going on.  No one talks about that.  Dude, I only had one.  I only had one.  I just know one person who I didn't know with.  That was the only story I could relay, because that was the only person I know who I didn't  know with, and that was the report I got.  So what do you want me to tell you?  What's that?  Jim, and it's the truth that all they ever do is talk about what a dumb bitch she is, 
[00:44:00]  and maybe she is, but the fact of the matter is that Obama gets in there and is lying  through his fucking teeth about everything, and nobody's calling this fucking guy on the  carpet.  Oh my God, that's well represented on our show.  I've constantly called out the fact that all of his campaign promises, none of them have  come to fruition in a year, and it's not even close.  All of these promises he made, he's done nothing.  It's been a slow year.  He has lied. 
[00:44:30]  It's been a bit of a slow year.  Those campaign promises were just as big of lies as other candidates have told.  His whole thing of transparency in his administration has been a lie.  The fact that he built this campaign on change, nothing has changed.  It's business as usual, democratic tax and spend.  He's an ass.  Why are you doing this?  Because he's ready to do a frunkus. 
[00:45:00]  Frunkus!  Alan, are you going to do a frunkus?  I just need to know.  I just need to know.  Come on, are you?  Last night, all they could concentrate on was how the McCain people were saying that  what Sarah's book was a bunch of lies.  Who gives a shit if she was lying in her book about the McCain campaign?  Obama's lying about the...  I don't think, honestly, I don't think Obama's lying.  I tell you what, I think that Obama is in a way over his head.  He's way too liberal for me. 
[00:45:30]  But I don't think he does...  He doesn't strike me as a liar.  He strikes me as an ideological guy who is way too ideological.  Why else would he go out and just try to be nice to Islam?  I think he bent the truth a little bit during the campaign.  Maybe in a political sense.  I honestly, I don't think the guy's a little-faced liar.  I just don't think he doesn't strike me as well.  He's not going to get much done.  I mean, the system's in place.  He can't make that crazy change.  Yeah, I think that's it.  I think now he's realizing what he can and can't get done.  The system is broken, man!  Yeah, just like Ronald Reagan couldn't get anything done when he made a bunch of cuts in the government, 
[00:46:00]  when he was crucified by his constituency and his Senate and Congress for axing programs.  Just taking the hatchet to him.  How are our taxes on the Reagan?  And it worked very, very good.  Do you like the taxes on the Reagan?  Oh, I wish I had those taxes.  But he got stuff done. 
[00:46:30]  I got a ball.  I got a ball.  All right.  He got stuff done during the Cold War, motherfucker, too.  Good call, by Ronald Reagan.  The great communicator.  That was his name.  Obama, you know, somebody brought up the fact some fucking Islamic nut goes into a military...  Why?  Sorry.  Well, it goes into...  No, it's just politics.  ...and starts blasting people.  And Obama's just pretty much ready to blow it off until the media got on him about it.  Which is true.  It's true. 
[00:47:00]  Ah, yeah.  Hey, uh...  Obama.  Yeah.  Uh, M. Zeno from Philly.  Jimmy has been conservative until this election.  Opie's barely a liberal.  Well, as a whole, the show is conservative.  Don't these people listen to the show?  But I really...  I'm not...  I'm more a moderate.  I'm more a against-the-system guy.  Wrong kind.  I was telling Ann today, like, I just don't understand why New York City's broke.  New York State is broke.  California's broke.  The country in general is broke.  I don't get it. 
[00:47:30]  I don't get when you're giving up almost half your money to the country in general, and it's broke.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I know that it's simplifying things tremendously, and I understand that, but that's what it comes down to me.  I don't understand it.  Like, Bloomberg's on TV saying they're going to have to cut the budget another few billion or a couple billion, whatever the fuck it was.  Major cuts across the board.  It's like, what the fuck are you doing?  What are we doing? 
[00:48:00]  It's mismanagement all over the place.  Where are the politicians that want money to hook up electrodes to teenage girls' genitals?  Oh, shit.  Remember that now?  Thank you.  Thank you for pointing that out, willful boy.  Boy, Ron Kind, I think, was the Ron Kind.  Can we get those ads on today?  I love that one.  We need a little comedy.  We need a little comedy at this point.  He wants to hook electrodes up to teen girls' genitals.  That's why the whole thing's a joke.  I'm like, get me to a voting booth pronto. 
[00:48:30]  But that's why the whole thing's a joke.  When you can make an ad where you're trying to tell your opponent that your opponent wants to hook up fucking electrodes to fucking teenage genitals.  The whole system is a joke.  Fantastic.  Do we have that commercial?  Do you have it, Travis?  I hope so.  I know we...  It's coming.  Oh, we got a lot of mileage out of that one.  We got some mileage out of that one.  We got one more Sarah Palin clip.  You want to hear it?  Sierra.  I'm concentrating on 2010 and making sure that we have...  Oh, yeah.  Oprah asked if... 
[00:49:00]  Because everyone is still taking it seriously that she might actually run for president in 2012, which it's like enough already.  It doesn't matter.  She'll be knocked out in the primary.  Of course.  But no one is willing to say that in the media.  They all are taking this very seriously.  Like, she might have a shot at this.  So, Oprah had to ask her.  I'm concentrating on 2010 and making sure that we have issues tackled as Americans to make sure that we're on the right road.  Would you even tell me if you were thinking about it?  No, I wouldn't.  Not on a...  That's all right.  That's all right.  That's all right.  But 2012...  Triggs heading into kindergarten in 2012. 
[00:49:30]  I'm looking forward to that.  I'm looking forward to affecting positive change between now and then.  I don't know what I'm going to be doing in 2012, but...  Would you answer this question?  Have you thought about running for president of the United States in 2012?  Have you just thought about it?  It's not on my radar screen right now.  Was it ever?  Was it ever?  As I am dealing with so many issues that are important and...  Oh, that's a lot of fucking question.  See, the problem is she wants everyone to think she might be running for president.  She has no intention of running for the presidency. 
[00:50:00]  She's not going to announce it now.  Someone was saying if she was running for the presidency, she would have a much bigger staff at this point.  And she has a very small staff at this moment in time.  And to Dan, why did this hero of yours, this heroine of public service, vacate her elected post to fucking go on a book tour?  Yeah.  She vacated her governor's job, you dope, to go out and fucking whore a book. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Because she enjoys the spotlight.  She got a little taste of the spotlight and said, well, this is where I want to live.  And we're not in an active election.  Hillary left, I think, to campaign and to run.  And then she became Secretary of State, which I'm not saying it's right.  But she didn't leave as important a post, first of all, as governor.  And why did she leave the post?  Why did she just walk away?  She's very busy with Trip and her book and looking forward to things that are right. 
[00:51:00]  So that's why I would take Biden over her, stupid Dan, because he's a guy who has proven, first of all, he took the train to work for years.  And he's a guy who didn't get rich on politics.  And he's a guy who I at least, hey, he stayed.  He didn't fucking bail out.  And I know he's had a history of, you know, which is certainly not perfect.  But he didn't just bail out and sell some cheesy book and walk away from a giant post like the governor of a state.  So, nerds to you, Dan.  Wow.  Oprah, what I am finding, clearer and clearer every day what I'm seeing is you don't need a title to make a difference. 
[00:51:30]  Any ordinary, ordinary American can seize opportunities to let their voice be heard,  to speak upon an issue or for a candidate that they believe in, and they can make a difference.  That is for sure.  Yuck.  Political babble.  That's what I see there.  And I give Oprah a C on that interview.  Cunt.  Tops.  Tops.  You've got to push these fucking people more. 
[00:52:00]  Sorry.  What happened?  I just thought of a line from Curb.  God, hit it.  That line.  Hit it.  And you're seeing, you're cunts in the sink.  Did you see Curb last time?  Cunts in the sink?  You're cunts in the sink.  It's a joke.  It's a long, drawn-out joke that someone was telling them that was the punchline.  Yeah.  But it's just, just to hear someone's hair and look into Jerry's face.  Curb's great this year, Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Do you watch Curb?  Never saw it.  Fuck, it's so fucking good.  Well, it's, I shouldn't say it's so fucking good.  I like it.  This season's great with the Seinfeld reunion thing.  It's really good.  It's just fun to see them, you know, together on the sets and everything.  I love Larry David's character.  And they're cursing.  I know.  Even though it's really basically him.  Yeah.  Some of the other people that...  Well...  But Larry David, every scene he's in is hilarious. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  He's yelling at people.  He's yelling.  This is the George Lopez thing.  You got to remember what we were talking about a half hour ago.  About George Lopez saying this about Sarah Palin's book.  It's a late night party.  Sarah Palin, like I don't know, Palin.  Sarah Palin was promoting her new book, Going Rogue.  How about we call that piece of shit Going Away?  All right. 
[00:53:30]  I like George Lopez because he's...  I've encountered him a few times and he's always been nice to me.  Really?  Even when I was doing the Veil Comedy Festival, like the mid-90s, and he was like one of the  big headliners with Goldthwait.  Ooh.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He treated me very nicely.  Is that show good?  I haven't taken a peek.  I've not seen it.  But he's always...  He's nice to young comics.  I saw Wanda Sykes' show, or the first 20 minutes, she does a very long monologue.  And it's really cool to see Keith Robinson all dressed up, all dressed up nice, showered. 
[00:54:00]  He's got, like, glasses on.  Damn.  He's working for Wanda Sykes.  They've been working together for years.  It's great to see Keith getting a break.  Yeah.  I kind of like the Wanda Sykes thing, what I've seen so far.  Yeah, I hope it does well because I like Wanda a lot.  And, of course, Keith, I want to see, you know, stay out of New York.  It's Wanda Sykes.  The better it does there, the better that show does, the less likely I'll have to see  that bag of shit.  So please support Wanda Sykes' show just to keep Keith out of here.  Is he in L.A. for this?  Yeah, he's miserable. 
[00:54:30]  I can imagine.  He's not an L.A. guy.  Oh, he's a fucking creep.  He texts me on Sunday.  He's like, you in L.A.?  I'm like, you lonely motherfucker.  I'm not, you in L.A.  The day after he tapes, he calls me.  That's great.  You want to hear the Ron Kind?  Yes, let's hear this.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost  nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. 
[00:55:00]  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders.  He even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag.  For Congress, Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  That's not music.  The right kind of congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign oil, 
[00:55:30]  to win the war on terror, and to defend traditional marriage.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I forgot.  Paul R. Nelson.  Does that still just make you very happy?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's the greatest.  Let it be known, Paul R. Nelson got his ass kicked.  Oh my God.  It wasn't even close.  Wrong kind won by a landslide.  This country wanted the wrong kind.  You know what's so fucking funny?  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:56:00]  These goddamn political ads, like when he said he voted to allow illegal aliens to burn the American flag.  Now, obviously, there was probably something that said, it's your constitutional right,  your freedom of expression and speech to burn the American flag.  It's been one of those hot issues for quite a while.  Well, but I guess as a symbolic gesture, it is legal to burn the American flag.  Tacking on all the other stuff, it doesn't matter who's burning it. 
[00:56:30]  Of course.  You're not going to get arrested for the sheer act of burning the American flag.  So an illegal immigrant could burn the American flag and not be arrested for it.  But the bill wasn't, let's allow illegal aliens to burn the American flag.  Where do I sign?  Right, of course.  They fucking twist these things around so much.  I have no doubt our listeners are smart enough to understand that.  Yeah, yeah.  But there has to be dummies out there that really believe what they just heard in that ad. 
[00:57:00]  Apparently not enough of them because they, you know.  True.  But there has to be some, right?  Yeah.  That's not the one we want to play, I don't know.  No, no.  I wanted the teen girl genitals and electrodes.  Thank you.  Thanks to E-Rock, who let the record state, ran in with the Paul R. Nelson clips, which we love.  The mega mix.  We got them all.  The ominous music, too, when he's talking about the opponent.  And then the bing, dee-dee-ding, bing, bing, bing, happy music comes on.  This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:57:30]  That was really Paul R. Nelson, man.  That was the candidate we backed.  We endorsed Paul R. Nelson, and he lost by a landslide.  Oh, boy, he had his list handed to him.  But E-Rock ran in here with the Paul R. Nelson disc, and which one is checked off, even though we wanted the genital one?  Track three, let the record state.  You see it right there?  Yep.  And that's not the right track.  No.  I think this one might be, but I'm not even positive.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending? 
[00:58:00]  The wrong kind.  Wrong kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes. 
[00:58:30]  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with probes connected to their genitalia. 
[00:59:00]  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, he wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Of course you do, Paul.  Thank you, Paul.  Wait, so instead of cancer research, instead of what was the other one?  Heart research?  Heart research, yeah.  And what was the third?  Oh, whatever.  Of soldiers.  Right.  You know, he'd rather sex.  What this turned out to be was it was some kind of grant that was approved to do a sex study. 
[00:59:30]  So these weren't separate issues that came up on a bill.  Teenage girls, electrodes, probes, genitals.  Let me sign off on this one.  What's next?  Old people's ball sacks?  Let me sign off on that one.  It was just a, it was one study that was being done, a sex study.  So, you know, sexuality in the world, I guess, Vietnamese fucking whores. 
[01:00:00]  If a lab wants to study how aroused girls get when they watch porno by hooking up some type of moisture meter to their twat, it's not, he's not doing that.  No, and he probably signed off on, well, we need such and such money for sexual education.  Sure.  So part of the sex ed money goes to this research program, which he had probably had no knowledge of where it went after it went to the sexual education part. 
[01:00:30]  But he made it sound like this guy's like, cancer?  Fuck them.  Fuck cancer.  Get the probes of these teen girls, twats.  Now.  I'm wrong kind.  It's hard to argue with him, to be honest with you.  It's fantastic.  Who the fuck, oh please, who gets that gig, first of all?  And what, old guys masturbating instead of heart research?  Instead of heart research.  Who would really make that decision?  Let's see, old guys jerking off or research on heart disease. 
[01:01:00]  I got these two bills in front of me.  I'm going to go for the old people jerking off.  I'm the wrong kind, wrong kind.  We need to know why the old guys are jerking off.  Right.  Fuck.  It's, it, but it's.  Now, here's the challenge.  Is, is that the best political ad ever?  Is there another one out there that comes close?  I know over the years we've tried to find a better one.  Nope.  That still is the number one, right?  That is the best political smear I've ever heard. 
[01:01:30]  It's, it's inaccurate.  It's, um, and believe me, I'm no fan of wrong kind.  Guy's a liberal douche.  But, uh, but, oh my God.  Was he misrepresented in those ads?  Lenore did a funny bit where they had political ads and they played these extreme political ads.  That was, they asked the audience, and he may have been on the Tonight Show, I don't know.  Did, who do you, do you think this guy won?  And then the audience would say yes or no, the guy wanted to win.  And it was sometimes surprising.  And I thought, I'd love to get these fucking Paul R. Nelson TV ads. 
[01:02:00]  Oh my God, yeah.  If they do it again.  Yeah, and, and, and he won.  You know, it's like, here's, here's how he's presented, but he won.  Yeah.  The wrong, not wrong kind, the wrong kind.  And the guy is so smarmy, the guy talking about it.  He's awful.  He's like, uh, illusionist.  He goes, uh, whoever they are.  Like he's, like he's just winging it.  Right.  Like he doesn't have a script in front of him.  Illusionist.  Uh, whoever they are.  It's wrong kind.  What a cock.  Oh, I love him.  What's the Bruce and Bubba spot? 
[01:02:30]  Do we know that one?  What?  It's tempting.  Let me see what this is.  Just for goofs, because it's on the, uh, fucking disc.  You never know.  It might be another piece of gold.  It might suck a dick.  Wrong kind.  Dearly beloved, we're gathered here to witness the marriage of this man, Bruce, to this,  uh, this other man, Bubba.  May if anyone objects to the marriage of Bruce and, and Bubba,  I don't.  Let him speak now or forever hold his peace.  Well, preacher, I object.  Oh, thank God.  State your objection, sir.  Well, preacher, it's, it's two dudes. 
[01:03:00]  Well, Ron kind says anything goes.  He says I can marry anything to anything.  Well, preacher, Ron kind is the wrong kind of guy to get advice from.  I never heard this one.  I love the wrong kind.  Boy, the guy that came up with that one at the campaign headquarters.  His name's Ron.  Hey, dude, what if we say he's the wrong kind?  Oh, we're going to win this thing.  We won.  We won.  We won with that.  He's the wrong kind. 
[01:03:30]  And they have to use it in every spot.  Ron kind.  He is the wrong kind.  The acting is horrendous, too.  Preacher, Ron kind is the wrong kind of guy to get advice from.  Hey, today it's two dudes.  Tomorrow it's two dudes.  A lesbian, a pedophile, and a partridge in a pear tree.  I think you better stop playing games with holy matrimony and leave things just the way God showed us in the Garden of Eden.  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, boy.  Romeo and Juliet, not Romeo and Julio.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, candidate for Congress.  I approve of this message, and my committee paid for it.  If you support traditional American values, help me keep marriage sacred.  Vote yes on the marriage amendment, and vote Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Paul got his ass kicked.  That old religious thing.  He got his ass kicked.  The Garden of Eden.  Did you mention the Garden of Eden, a political ad?  Yeah, you're done.  You are fucking finished.  Done, Steve.  Yeah, cook the apple, not two testicles.  Thank you, stupid.  Why did we support Paul? 
[01:04:30]  Satan is the wrong guy.  Why did we support Paul R. Nelson?  Because he lives.  Dude.  That's the only reason.  Because his commercials are fantastic.  Why wouldn't we?  The other guy is someone you want to party with, though.  Yeah, really.  Adam and Steve.  Oh, wow.  What?  Yes.  Adam, yes.  Adam, I've told you not to call me when I'm not producing.  Which could be any time. 
[01:05:00]  Which means you can always call me.  Stephen S. Robesio, our Paul R. Nelson is a fucking loon.  He really is.  Oh, I love it.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Okay.  I have a suggestion, by the way, from a fan for Google Trends.  Google.  For today?  Yeah, because I, on Red Eye last night, mentioned the black Columbia professor punching the  white woman in the face.  Yes.  In the context of the news.  Um, and somebody suggested that we, uh, how do you guys do the, how does that work, the 
[01:05:30]  Google Trends thing?  Let me just, uh, put whatever you say into, into Google.  Into Google.  Over and over again.  What's more we can do with that?  I would like to, uh, to Google Trend that.  Um, all right.  And, uh, what?  Black Columbia professor.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Jimmy likes trannies.  You don't even need to Google Trend that.  Just, just put Jim Norton in quotes.  Jim Norton trends.  How about black Columbia professor punches white woman?  Is that too long? 
[01:06:00]  It's long, but how else are you going to do it?  Black Columbia professor punches white woman.  Yeah.  I'm obsessed with this.  I'm obsessed with the lack.  I don't even know what the, whether or not she was a fucking shoved him for, I don't  know the, I just know the way the media ignored it and not one fucking woman's group  have I heard from publicly and not one fucking protest at that shitty left wing universe.  Not, can you, not one protest to have that guy fired for punching a female staffer in  the fucking face.  I'd like to know more info. 
[01:06:30]  Maybe he, maybe you'd read it and go, oh, that's it.  Absolutely.  I'm glad he punched her in the face, but you know something?  That story.  They just steered.  They buried it.  The story is long gone too.  And believe me.  You're going to lose that one.  Again.  That one's done, unfortunately, Jim.  Not necessarily.  I, I, again, I know it's easy to say, but I know somebody who works in one of the, let's  say one of the local papers and she did ask a supervisor.  We know people in the papers.  We know these people.  It could be a dirty professor.  Mix up with the crackers and she got what was coming to her.  Jim has a lot of mysterious friends. 
[01:07:00]  I know.  No, but I just respect people's privacy.  A lot of mysterious friends.  They're very mysterious.  We are friends, Jimmy.  We are not paranoid to think that that story was consciously buried.  Of course it was.  We do have to take a break.  Of course.  We can continue with that after the break, certainly.  Please Google bum that.  We also have a woman being tased.  It's terrific.  We have.  Uh, I just have to bring this up.  Uh, after the statement of, well, who was that?  Steve?  That came in and said the computer is, has been fixed.  Steve, this morning.  Steve came in and said, he literally said it this morning. 
[01:07:30]  It will not, it is, it will not crash anymore.  Danny is now on his fourth or fifth computer crash.  Fifth?  I think I'm about to say about eight already.  Eight, eight crashes.  I think I'm about to say so far.  Steve's literally said, the computer is working perfectly.  Just, the computer's working like me.  Like, I, I'm rebooting.  I open a browser, Firefox or Internet Explorer.  Yeah.  It crashes.  No matter what happens.  It's just, it needs to, this computer just needs to be replaced. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, it's done.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Uh, we're going to.  Wrong kind of computer.  We're going to find out what, we're going to find out what, um, the word of the year  is.  Word of the year.  2009.  Oh, are these, these words that kind of, uh, become part of our vocabulary during the  year?  I don't know it.  And, and that's like the new one.  That, that means I had to read the whole fucking thing.  Like, like years ago, it was, um, it's not quite a word, but it's like internet, it  was the information superhighway.  Or download.  I think in general, yes.  I think in general, it's just the word of the year. 
[01:08:30]  Email.  I don't think it's the new word of the year.  Yeah.  No, in this case, it is a newer word.  It's a word that people are using.  It's the word of the year for 2009.  Do not look at your screen.  We're going to try to figure that out after the break.  I'm going to look up the whole time.  It's frunkus.  That's frunkus.  And other shit on the way.  Anybody coming in today?  I don't even know.  Levy's in.  We got Cutra and Rich.  We're doing a, from 8.04 to like, it's a really, like a 12 or 15 minute hookup with  those guys in Boston.  They're helping promote my, my, uh, my shows in Boston next week. 
[01:09:00]  And they're also, uh, nice to say hello to the old Boston listeners.  Yeah.  And I want to talk about movies.  I just, I see a fact here that seems.  Factoid?  Seems impossible.  What else do we have for this?  Only one of the top 20 grossing films.  We'll just discuss this after the break.  This decade is an original idea.  Only one of the top 20.  Tucker Massie's movie?  The only one of the top 20 grossing films.  2012.  No. 
[01:09:30]  No.  Do you, do you know the movie?  The only, uh, no, I have to wrap my mind around the question.  The Black Honeymooners.  All right.  Here's the, here it is.  The question is, we're going to find out what the word of the year is in this too.  Only one of top 20 grossing films this decade is an original idea.  What are the other ones?  Like, what's not an original idea?  Not a sequel or a remake.  A sequel or a remake.  Okay.  So the Batman movies, obviously.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You think you get the movie?  Uh-huh. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I'll figure it out.  Only one of the, oh, I got it.  What?  I got it, right?  You did?  I don't know.  I didn't see the, I'm going to write down.  I didn't see the entire list, but I think I might know what it is.  Is this what you're thinking?  I think it just hit me.  Why don't you write your movie down right now?  I'm trying to think.  I can't even think of one.  I'm going with this.  Did you just say that?  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Is that it?  I think it's obvious.  I didn't look.  I don't know if that's the right answer, but me and Danny are on the same page.  I think it was a weird...  Why is Jimmy laughing as he writes his answer? 
[01:10:30]  I'm not.  It was a weird...  Sorry to give it away.  But I'm laughing because I know it's such a weird conceptual thing, but I think it was original.  It was a big...  It was a movie on racial diversity and conflict.  Yeah.  Let me see.  I don't know.  I'm embarrassed now.  It might not be right.  Let me see.  It might not be right.  No, it wasn't the time for marmalade.  It was the time for marmalade.  Time for marmalade. 
[01:11:00]  I think me and you were wrong.  We're wrong?  Yeah, because it wasn't part of this decade.  And that's the question.  Yeah, that was in 97.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, you're talking the 2000s.  Yeah, this decade.  Oh, fuck did I just fuck that?  Yeah.  All right.  Why do I keep thinking it's the 90s?  Me and Danny wrote down Titanic.  Oh, my God.  You're not going to guess the answer.  No?  No.  No.  Yeah, I will.  I wouldn't have thought of it.  All right.  We'll figure it out next.  So, once again, only one of the top 20 grossing films this decade is an original idea. 
[01:11:30]  We're going to figure that out next.  And it's the Cod.  The Cod.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  About now.  About now. 
[01:12:00]  About now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:12:30]  I've been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.  Paul R. Nelson is dead.  Paul R. Nelson, tear down that hole.  Right about now, Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Take it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Take it out now, I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:13:00]  Take it out now, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Take it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building. 
[01:13:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, we're going to be live in Boston in what?  About a half hour?  I think from about 8 to 8.15, something like that.  8 to 8.15 with Toucher and Rich?  Yeah.  They're now doing the sports talk?  Yep.  I don't know how much the show has changed, but when I called in with those guys, it was 
[01:14:00]  still the same show.  I mean, they may have changed slightly, but I'm happy that they survived, man.  It's a miracle they survived that whole flip-flop and fucking moving down the dial, but they're  still there.  And my Islanders kicked the Bruins' asses last night, 4 to 1.  Hello!  Hey, you know we were yelling and screaming yesterday about the new ad campaign for SiriusXM Satellite  Radio?  Yes, I remember that.  They debuted the big commercial on Sunday during the football games. 
[01:14:30]  They're very excited at SiriusXM about their new commercial.  I'll just keep it at that.  They're very excited.  I don't want to rain on their parade.  I would question a couple things in there, but whatever.  Of course.  I'm just a dopey radio guy.  I don't work in marketing, even though I know way more about marketing than the people  that work here.  But if I say that too loud, then I'll get yelled at.  But we did yell and scream about our placement on the website.  Remember it?  Yes.  Because after the big ad, and if you go to SiriusXM, you'll see Elvis, Jordan, Richard 
[01:15:00]  Pryor, and Howard Stern.  And then we're changing the way you listen, which is a nice little slogan for SiriusXM.  I kind of like that part of it.  And then it goes into a, what would you call it, just a, I want to say a grid, but what?  It's like the Situation Room has all those different virtual monitors, it looks like.  And it looks like they're all stacked up.  Right.  So, one, two, and they feature on the front page, actually one, two, three, four, twelve, 
[01:15:30]  twelve channels you could really see their logos.  And then you click on whichever one you want to learn more about, whether it's fucking  Howard or Elvis.  And then it gives you a little synopsis about that channel and a little sample.  It's actually well done and put together nicely.  But we noticed yesterday that our fucking channel and our logo is nowhere to be seen  when you first go to SiriusXM. 
[01:16:00]  No, no.  But then if you click and move shit around, you finally get to our Logan, our Logan, hello.  If that's not a, if that's not a good slip.  You finally get to our channel.  And we yelled and screamed about it yesterday.  So, there was a lot of commotion after the show yesterday.  Commotion.  And they went to, and the guys that worked for the channel, they got involved and they  tried to fix it.  And then an email came out around four this morning. 
[01:16:30]  Good news, guys.  Hey.  Your complaint really helped out because now your channel and logo is on the page when  you go to SiriusXM.  Right.  Well, half our logo is.  They can't even commit and put our fucking channel name right there.  Half.  It's half.  It's half.  That's not good news to me.  Half and funny show.  Half is not good news to me either.  No.  E and funny.  If you saw half the Coke logo, I don't think Coke would appreciate that. 
[01:17:00]  No.  Half is never good.  If you saw only half the McDonald's logo, I don't think McDonald's would be jumping up  and down all happy.  But this email came out.  Good news, guys.  Look.  Look.  If you go to SiriusXM.  Actually, I'm going to read the email, Ian.  This is unprecedented.  Good morning.  As I mentioned, Topey and Jim in the hallway, you guys made some good points about the marketing  campaign yesterday morning.  The website has been updated to give you guys more prominent placement.  So I got all excited and I went to SiriusXM to see half our logo is displayed. 
[01:17:30]  You know, I can't even complain.  You have to complain.  No, I can't even.  You have to complain all the time.  I'll take it.  We're right under Lance Armstrong and Fox News.  Well, that's why I'm complaining because yesterday I thought that said Lance Armstrong.  It's Dance Electronic.  Right.  And from the way it's cut off, it looks like Lance Armstrong.  They should move hip-hop, R&B to where you guys are.  Fucking get our goddamn name on the front page of SiriusXM. 
[01:18:00]  It's sort of on the front page now.  That's not good news to me.  Hey, we're halfway there.  Literally.  If you saw half a logo on TV, that company would be pissed off.  Absolutely.  Half is never good.  We work with rookies.  And why did we have to point out that this was a problem?  Well, because we're us.  And that's our show.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This goes beyond the bitching that maybe we do too much of. 
[01:18:30]  No, I mean, it's because we noticed.  There's people that should be noticing this way before we do.  We should never have to point out that we're not being represented when you first click on SiriusXM.  Do you think aside from Howard being in the middle, anything else was considered?  No, of course not.  Or do you think they just kind of threw them all?  No, the whole company's banking on Howard's success.  That's what they have decided on.  That's not my call or anyone's call.  No, it's not even so much the Howard thing.  I'm talking about the other ones that surround it.  Do you think they spent any time thinking about NASCAR being there? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, yeah, for sure.  You think they did?  Yeah, but they kind of blew it because I swear to God, if you want to pay me, I'll fucking do a little part-time marketing for you.  Hockey is happening right now.  So why wouldn't you have your fucking hockey logo front and center when you go to SiriusXM?  Why wouldn't you do that?  You don't need the Lance Armstrong logo.  Lance Armstrong.  I mean, there's a few there you don't really need front and center.  When hockey is happening now, people go there and go, what? 
[01:19:30]  I could fucking listen to any hockey game that's going on tonight.  That's cool to sports fans.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that SiriusXM satellite radio has rock channels.  Well, I would make that argument that you don't really have to push the music so much these days because you get music everywhere.  So you really should push the talent and the specialty programming that you can't get on your iPod or on the Internet and whatnot.  There's definitely a thought process that goes into what's on that front homepage. 
[01:20:00]  I mean, aside from starting, I mean, you have Oprah, baseball, Elvis, NASCAR radio, which is huge for a lot of people out there.  Yeah, I understand why most of these fucking logos are there.  I completely get it.  And for us to yell about our logo being front and center, we believe we should be there because we're not here at SiriusXM to just be one fucking channel that is buried among a lot of these channels that you never hear of.  We want to be front and center.  We want to be the fucking top dog here.  That's our goal.  So that's open for debate.  But to not put the NHL stuff on the front, you know, when you first click on SiriusXM is not smart. 
[01:20:30]  That's just not smart.  Home ice should be right in the middle.  Simple as that.  That one, you're going to lose that argument every fucking time.  Well, they switched our position with jazz standards.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, thanks.  So they moved jazz standards out.  So we're a little better than jazz standards.  That's good.  At least we're moving up a little bit.  We edged out Foxhole.  Huh?  We edged out the Foxhole.  Yeah, we should edge out the Foxhole. 
[01:21:00]  Of course we should.  We should edge out all the channels that have part-time.  Opera radio.  That have part-time fucking performers on them.  All right.  Not enough, because...  Rossi is split in half.  Who?  Rossi.  Janice.  Oh, it's Rosie.  It's Rosie.  Janice, Rossi.  But they put Rosie's where you can see as soon as you go over to SiriusXM, because  they think Rosie's more important than us.  That's how I look at that stuff.  There's no other way to look at it.  Anthony, what is the movie? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, what is the word?  The word.  Yeah, the word of the year.  It is.  2009's word of the year.  The word everyone's been using.  Does anyone want to guess?  You got one, Jimmy?  I can't say it on the air.  Oh, yes.  Anthony's word of the decade.  Yes.  The word of my life.  Fucking David, Tennessee. 
[01:22:00]  I just got to go to this for a second.  Go ahead, Dave.  Go ahead.  Take your shot, you fuck.  All right, Opie.  You're a brilliant marketer.  Although the human relations...  Are you thinking it's a good idea to attack the marketing department?  Dude, they suck.  Oh, I agree.  This fucking marketing team here, I don't even know who they are.  Which is not...  That's pretty sad if we don't even know who they are.  Because we're supposed to be one of the big shows here at SiriusXM.  I don't even know their names.  When we got a tape...  Go get with them and figure out... 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, and talk to them.  It's not my fucking job to search these people out.  We got so many people behind the scenes working for this channel.  I don't even know what they do.  Do you know what marketing do?  This is marketing...  I get on a national platform at one point once a week.  I don't know how often I'll be on Leto.  I'm going after tomorrow night.  Marketing...  Nobody from this company has sat down with me or talked to me and said,  Look, we know that you're sometimes using the platform and the intro, sometimes not.  It just doesn't make sense. 
[01:23:00]  I'm literally on Red Eye once a week, which is a very fast-going show at Fox, which has a huge audience.  No one.  Not one.  It doesn't make business sense to me.  We make a lot of really smart points when we do our bitching.  If you have a marketing department here at SiriusXM, you should sit down with Jimmy and go...  I'm going to just reiterate, but you sit down with Jimmy and go,  Yeah, you're on Leno and you're on Red Eye.  Those are two big national shows.  Is there anything we could do to maybe get the logo or the Opie and Anthony brand on the show? 
[01:23:30]  We'll cross-promote a little bit.  We'll promote the appearances.  That's just basic shit.  It's common sense.  That's just basic shit.  It's unbelievable.  When we have Sharon Osbourne trashing Susan Boyle and not one person comes running down the hall and goes,  Wow, that's something we could be working in the marketing department.  We should get that out there.  That's good exposure for you guys and the company.  We did it on our own.  Yep.  And nationally, we got international exposure on that one.  Because you're hearing talk that you're not going to... 
[01:24:00]  There's no way you could hear that because she's cursing and stuff.  You couldn't hear that on regular radio.  So that's the selling point.  Right.  And by the way, I'm not happy with the fucking logo on the front page of Sirius XM.  I don't want half a logo.  I want the whole fucking logo.  So get back to the drawing board and see if you can get that done.  And put the NHL home ice right on the front page.  I'll help the whole company.  Hockey's really hot right now.  Danny, what's the matter?  You look very upset.  Because his computer's shot.  He's still fucking on the fridge. 
[01:24:30]  Some other stuff.  All right.  You know what?  Is it about me?  No.  Are you mad at me?  I love you, James.  Don't you hate codependent people?  Are you mad at me?  Are you mad at me?  What are you doing?  You know people like that?  Like, you're in a mood and you're like, did I do something?  No.  What did I do?  They're all like that.  We all suck.  What did I do?  Here is your word of the year, Anthony.  I think it's...  Is it political?  No.  Oh, no.  Wait.  It's social network-y.  Oh, okay.  I know what it is.  It's social network-y.  I know it.  Did you cheat? 
[01:25:00]  No, no.  But since you said that, I know what it is.  Oh, Twitter?  No.  Nope.  I know what it is.  Tweet?  No.  It's social network-y.  Oh, wait.  Okay.  Tweet?  No.  It's just social network-y.  Email?  Yep.  Let me see.  No, you're not going to take it seriously.  Oh, no.  I take it seriously.  Hat brim. 
[01:25:30]  Is it hat brim?  Give yourself a fucking punch to the teeth.  Hat brim.  Hat brim.  That's going to be my new band.  Here it is.  And listen for the great banter between the news fucking readers.  Finally, the word of the year is familiar to anyone who has spent some time on Facebook.  According to the new Oxford American Dictionary, the word of the year is unfriend, defined  as removing someone as a friend.  Unfriend.  Unfriend.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, okay.  The word of the year should be blocked.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  I don't unfriend somebody.  That's what I love about this social networking.  You can get rid of all the fake fans.  Blocked.  Goodbye.  Yeah, it's not like message boards anymore.  No, they're fake fucking fans.  You?  Gone.  Unfriend.  It's unfriend, defined as removing someone as a friend on a social networking site like  Facebook.  Other finalists included tech terms, netbook, and sexting. 
[01:26:30]  Those are your tech bites.  I'm Vanita Nyer.  You don't know how to unfriend because you don't know how to friend anybody because you  don't do Facebook.  No, I don't do Facebook.  I need to get unfriend.  Yeah, you really do.  Will you be my friend?  I would be your friend.  I would never unfriend you.  You would never unfriend me?  Okay.  You heard it here, folks.  I will let you know if he does.  The cast of the new moon hit the red carpet.  Oh, God.  That banter is the worst.  And what's going off on the news banter today?  You were making me laugh as we're sitting here reading our fucking newspapers.  They got a comment on every story. 
[01:27:00]  Which one did we watch in the morning?  Fox 5 in New York.  They're just horrendous.  It is the worst newscast I've ever heard.  They were making VHS and beta jokes.  Oh, they try to have this rapport and...  I don't even know what they were trying to do.  Nothing.  Yes.  It was Sam Coulter.  Word of the year.  Yes, it was Propofol.  Propofol.  Word of the year.  Ah, Propofol.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, where's Sam?  Because we got something good. 
[01:27:30]  Sam.  We got two really good radio things, actually.  Get in here, Sam.  Supposedly Rob Schneider got in a fight with Wild 95.5.  Really?  You ever do Wild 95.5 in West Palm Beach?  That's a while.  I don't know.  I may have, because I couldn't do a...  This might have to wait.  I couldn't have that Lopeweiser.  Oh, God.  They wouldn't put you on the show?  No.  I mean, and they wouldn't help promote the show at all.  And it's like, they just obviously didn't like me, so that's why I turned on the whole  station.  Yeah, good for you.  Sam, I know it's not...  Welcome.  I know it's not Jocktober anymore, but remember when we told Sam he's got to keep the thing 
[01:28:00]  going?  Yes.  Well, he came to the table with some fine audio today.  We just need a name, because we're out of October.  We can't call...  Good boy.  Thank you.  We can't call Jocktober anymore.  We need a name for this.  We're going to do one a month, maybe two a month, you know, that type of thing, just  to kind of keep it going.  I got a catchy name.  Yeah?  Shit Radio.  Shit Radio.  Shit Radio is kind of simple and really...  It's right to the point.  It's good for branding. 
[01:28:30]  But people may confuse it with this program.  Okay, that's true.  I didn't think of that.  How about Hat Full of Marmalade?  That's actually my autobiography.  I'm working on my life story.  Hat Full of Marmalade.  Hat Full of Marmalade.  I didn't ask you what that meant.  And it's me sitting with a top hat with orange marmalade overflowing with a pensive look  on my face.  Oh, pensive.  In an office chair.  I think you should be holding it, but looking toward the future.  I am.  Like there's more marmalade to be put in this hat buster.  Because there's many, many marmalade flavors. 
[01:29:00]  A fedora or a derby.  It's more of a Lincoln Light Hats.  Because you can sew a stovepipe.  You can scoop marmalade into it.  A lot of marmalade in a Lincoln Stovepipe.  I love that marmalade.  Shit Radio.  Let's go with that, Ann.  I like your idea.  Shit Radio.  And when D-Boy's not obsessing about Lionsgate films...  Lionsgate films.  I think he could do some real good production around the term shit radio.  Don't even mention Lionsgate to him.  And he's not watching that precious movie.  No.  He's not interested in it. 
[01:29:30]  No.  Who would be?  Gives a flying fuck.  Gayle King's already seen it five times.  Why not go?  Really?  Why has she seen it five times?  I don't know.  She said on a radio show that she's seen it five times.  And who did she bring five times?  Why would she see that movie five times?  She enjoyed it.  She saw it five times before it even opened.  Why?  What did she like about it?  She just thought it was a very touching tale.  It is deeply depressing.  You got Monique hitting that fucking fat black girl with a frying pan and throwing her down 
[01:30:00]  the stairs and shit.  That shit I want to see.  Is it a comedy or drama?  Honestly.  It's actually a drama.  It involves a tragic drama.  It's a deep drama.  It's one of those fucking movies that you get really, really brought down.  Paternal.  We got a trailer?  Let's pop up that trailer.  I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to.  The most emotional movie experience of the year is Precious.  That's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about home.  Rolling Stone Rays. 
[01:30:30]  Precious has a spirit that soars.  It will steal your heart.  There is something you do well.  No, who?  Everybody's good at something.  It simply cannot be.  Eating.  Eating.  Eating.  Eating and giving birth.  This year's best films.  The longest journey began with a single step.  I'm just trying to be.  What the?  Precious.  Read it on.  Yes.  The longest journey begins with a single broken floorboard.  Thank you, fatso.  All right.  I see what they did.  Yeah.  I see what they fucking did.  They're tricking you.  What they did.  The new fucking, this is the new preview. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  The original preview has Monique like a motherfucker.  Really?  It's just creepy how depressing and vicious and cruel Monique is to this precious.  Now they're making it heartwarming and how people love her and stuff.  Oh, I thought this fat girl fell in the well when the girl was down there.  She got lured in with a bone.  Put the fucking elephant in the basket.  It puts the blue whale in the basket.  It does this when it's told. 
[01:31:30]  Largest animal on earth?  Blue whale, 100 feet.  I know.  That's why you went with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went with the sperm whale, but that makes me thirsty.  Living.  That was very smart.  Even living.  What was before that that was bigger?  I challenge you.  Brontosaurus.  Were they bigger?  How long were they?  Go.  Yes.  They were very long.  What was the largest creature ever?  Maybe it was the Brontosaurus.  I don't know if that was bigger than the blue whale, though.  It's got a new name now, but I can't remember it.  They have some shit in the ocean, though, man.  Somebody help us out here.  How come Danny's not looking it up? 
[01:32:00]  What?  How come Danny's not looking it up?  Danny just doesn't care about the computer today.  He's lollygagging.  He's sitting back in his chair while the computer's just...  How about a little Googling, Dan?  Well, because it freezes.  What?  Google freezes my computer.  I don't know.  Dude.  Why?  It's very high-res.  Before we move on from Precious...  It's very graphics-intensive.  You've got to hear this.  John in Georgia.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, hey, Opie.  Yeah, Ronnie says he loves Precious because of the fat black Juno, and he loves the new 
[01:32:30]  Blindside movie because of the fatter blacker Rudy.  Yeah, fat black Rudy.  The fatter blacker Juno?  Yeah.  Is that what Ron Bennington said?  Yeah.  That's fucking...  That's fucking...  Fatter blacker Juno.  That is smart and funny.  That is really good.  And also mean-spirited.  No.  Wow, they made that trailer a lot easier.  Yeah, because there are some themes in that movie that are not illustrated.  It was brutal, man.  Fucking Monique.  You don't even recognize her as this mother just beating the shit out of Precious.  What happens to Precious? 
[01:33:00]  That's so bad.  Her mother beats her.  She gets raped by her dad.  She gets raped by her dad.  And has the kid, I think.  Has the three kids.  Is the movie about her dad trying to recover from that awful sex?  Oh, my God.  He banged a fatty.  Fatso.  Poor dad's in therapy.  Fucking Monique throws her down the stairs, I think.  Oh, really?  Then she's pregnant with her...  Yes, becomes a ramp after Fatso rolls off.  Then she's pregnant with her second kid, and it's just a mess.  Yeah, it's really...  No one loved or cared about Precious, but by the end of the movie, I bet people care about 
[01:33:30]  it, right, Sam?  Well, this is the thing.  I bet she comes right around.  I don't know if she dies at the end.  If she can make it out of that mess, you could make it out of whatever mess you're in.  Oh, that is.  I feel like that's what it is.  She can make it out of her shoes.  You can make it out of any mess you're in.  Those fucking mushed-down canoes.  Thank you, bunion feet.  Take those fucking ham hock feet and fucking roll out of here.  Precious kid.  You want to try a different trailer?  I could play it out of my iPhone if you want.  Hey, I want to hear that.  How come the computer's restarting?  Yeah, what's going on?  I thought it was... 
[01:34:00]  Steve said the computer was all set and ready to go.  ...fixed and will not crash anymore.  It has crashed more today than any day since we've been here.  No, I know it had to be true because Steve read it out of his notebook.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Steve, by the way, what did you say when you came in this morning about the computer?  I said, I can actually read you what I have from the IT guys.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm not debating what you're telling me.  I understand.  It was broken last night when they walked in here to fix it, or it was frozen, I'm sorry.  When they walked in here to fix it, they assured me that it was fixed and to let them know if 
[01:34:30]  the issues continue.  He was very excited coming and telling us that the computer was a fix today.  Throttle it back a little.  I wasn't excited, but I don't think it was.  Everybody, listen, everyone.  This computer was frozen when I walked into the studio about an hour ago.  I made some changes and some testing, and it seems to be working fine now.  Hopefully, there won't be any more issues with...  I didn't check Google.  Maybe they thought we wanted it to freeze more, and they said it's fixed now because  it freezes more. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know.  I was pretty specific when I said the browsers, both Internet Explorer and Firefox, are freezing.  The computer's crashing, and we need this to be fixed immediately.  Ace app.  As they say.  So, I have already sent the email, and Danny's already made the call, so hopefully this will  get fixed sometime this month.  Of course it won't.  We'll, uh, eagerly awaiting the solution to that problem.  Of course.  We're just getting a new computer.  Could do that.  Um, when are we doing Touch and Rich? 
[01:35:30]  We got time this right.  8.05?  Yeah, we should probably break, too, because Mars has to set up the ISDN.  For real?  Oh, wait.  Are we okay, Javi?  Well, no.  Jimmy wanted to do the, uh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  My Sammy.  Are you really?  Are you just having a conversation?  Go outside.  What are we doing?  Do we have to break first to set up the ISD?  I know we make this look easy, but people are just having conversation.  Go outside.  Oh, it's a whole jibber-jabber fest.  Excuse my language.  Jimmy, you wanted in on this.  Oh, yeah.  We could probably do this before the break.  Uh, Sam, your dumb bitch's going to have to wait until after the break. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  Not dumb.  Let's not.  Let's get the people excited.  Because we've got to get Touch and Rich on the air.  Court won't hear appeal from a group who says NFL's Redskins name is offensive.  The Supreme Court turned down their appeal.  Uh-huh.  Uh, they've been litigating for 17 years.  Wow.  And, uh, they actually have-  Think of the legal fees.  17 years.  Yes.  Think of the legal fees.  Let's just ponder that for a moment.  That'll be $200, $300.  Um, you, uh-  Wait, we won one.  Wow.  Right?  Not as far as Jimmy's concerned. 
[01:36:30]  So the, uh, what's happened is, uh, they said no, but they actually have six more.  I was rooting against the Redskins on this, even though I don't think it should be litigated.  I don't think the court should say you can't do it.  I think the Redskins should change the name.  Um.  Voluntarily?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's one of those, it's very, very rarely that I feel on the side of political correctness.  Yeah, I, I, I, I don't think you, you should budge at all.  I don't think so either.  I don't think you should budge at all.  I'm kind of thinking- 
[01:37:00]  Because the problem is they don't stop there ever.  That's why I don't think you budge ever on these things, man.  There are double standards as far as what-  Right.  Um, races and, and religions and things get a little more leeway than others in this, uh, world.  And, and sometimes we're on the receiving end of the shit.  And sometimes, uh, other people are.  And that seems to be the way it, it goes.  It's just, but it, to what bothers me is there's not, there's not a lot of American Indians playing NFL football.  There's not a lot of American Indians with a giant lobbying power or special interest power. 
[01:37:30]  And that's why they're not getting what they want.  Uh, if they were, if they were blacks, if they were Jews, if they were Irish, if they were any other,  Italians, any other group that had a lot more, um, lobbying power or visibility in that sport, say.  Yeah.  It would be taken more seriously.  But you know what it is?  It's kind of a, a powerful thing.  I've always thought of it as empowering that a football team named after, uh, you know, Indians.  Yeah.  Is, is like an empower. 
[01:38:00]  It's like, it's like if they, you know, if there were Vikings around, would they be mad that, that, uh, there's a team called the Vikings?  Well, I, I think the argument they would make.  It's powerful and it's.  It's like they were, they were people.  They would, they would say that we were conquered here.  Uh, they, they are coming from a place of having been beaten into submission in a way.  That's like saying we want to name a team the Black Bucks because the, the Black Buck, the slave, was a very strong, powerful figure as a slave.  So it's not an insult because a Black Buck is a very strong person. 
[01:38:30]  And they would go, yeah, but the underlying meaning, the bigger picture of that.  What city's picking them up?  What's that?  What city would take them?  The Black Buck?  Uh, Detroit.  Um.  I think Detroit or?  Oh, definitely Detroit.  Detroit Black Bucks?  Oakland?  Oakland would be, uh, definitely, yeah.  Jesus.  But you understand what I'm saying?  Like, that, that's, that's the way, they look at it like, from what I, I, again, I was always like, fuck these people, they're annoying.  And then I heard them talking about their point.  And I think they said that Redskins was what you would call a bunch of Indian bodies piled up in a cart.  That's what they would refer to as we've got a bunch of Redskins.  Like, that's where that name came from. 
[01:39:00]  I thought it was just because their skin was a little red.  Nah, but it was a really, it was like a really fucking, because, because they were out in the sun too much.  Yeah.  You wouldn't call a team the Zyklon Bears, uh, in reference to the fucking, the Jews that were murdered.  You wouldn't do it with any of the group.  I like my sports.  I like my, uh, old school sports, uh, teams, names.  Big time.  I just, I, only in the case of a couple of their complaints, I, because they, they're like, you don't see any other religion cartooned or parodied.  Angels. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, but that's, you know what, that's such a, that's such a, that's such a.  New Jersey devils.  But those aren't, those have become such common usage in our language, those aren't necessarily.  That's how the Redskins are.  I don't even think about the actual Redskins name when I see Washington Redskins, to be honest with you.  Most people don't.  Are black people, are black people mad at, uh, Pittsburgh?  Pittsburgh.  Did we do this before?  Yes, we did.  That's hilarious.  We did this before.  That's fucking funny.  That's fucking hilarious. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  It rang a bell right after I said it.  Yeah.  Very funny.  Funny both times.  So, it's rare that I agree with this.  Only a couple of the names.  I love it.  They just, they, it really.  Can we agree to disagree on this one?  Oh, absolutely.  I'm too tired of fighting.  I don't want to fight.  I like the, uh, I just like the, what about like the Braves?  I don't think, I don't think in the, I just think a Braves.  Look what they do, look what they do at the, it's, I know what they do at the game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, do it, it is, do it, uh, have it with the, the, how crazy you'd look if everyone 
[01:40:30]  was going, Allahu Akbar, or fucking, uh, you know, uh, Body of Christ, the Body of Christ,  do something that parodies any other religion, or shake like Jews at the, the Wailing Wall  when they pray.  Wailing Wall in the, in the stands, they're all just praying.  It's just that they, and that's why it annoys me, it's because, again, it's like that whole  fucking double standard, and in this particular case, like, yeah, I kind of agree with it.  Political correctness sucks, but there are times where there are things that are just,  yeah, we probably shouldn't say them, because they are fucking, like, they're not politically 
[01:41:00]  correct to change.  A lot of people are going to disagree with me on this.  Yeah.  But let them.  Uh, Rich and Buffalo, Syracuse changed their name from the Orange Men to the Orange.  I did not know that, actually, because of American Indians.  I don't mind that.  It was the Syracuse Orange Men for, forever, and I never thought Indians when I thought  Orange Men.  Was it, uh, uh, Indian, or?  I don't even know it, to be honest.  Yes, of course.  I lived pretty close to, uh, Syracuse for a long time, so, I mean, I heard about the  Orange Men forever.  Maybe they could pick a not lame team name.  Just leave the teams alone. 
[01:41:30]  No one had a problem for a really long time.  I like my fucking old school team names.  I really do.  Yeah, it kind of, you know what it does?  It kind of, uh, messes with your little childhood nostalgic thinking of, of things.  Yeah.  What's more important, though?  Like, our childhood nostalgia, or people feeling like fucking they're being cartooned?  I want to feel like a child.  How much did I, how much did I drop at Mohegan?  Right.  Tell me that, and then I'll tell you what the fuck names I want the sports teams called.  Yeah, Jimmy, I think they're getting us back at this point.  I really do. 
[01:42:00]  I only agree with that.  I'm not saying that.  They're getting away with murder at the casinos.  The fighting Irish I don't have a problem with.  I'm Irish.  It doesn't bother me.  Who broke that one?  Well, what?  All of the Detroit defendants.  Kevin from Connecticut.  What are we doing?  Are we breaking before these guys?  No.  No.  Oh, I can't.  I can't say what Atlanta would be.  Why?  Atlanta what?  It's really bad.  We don't need more, because we only got them for, I think they're ready, like, right now,  if you want to go.  Okay.  How do we go there? 
[01:42:30]  Now, Bill and Vladimir Radmanovich, Allen Iverson and the Memphis Grizzlies have both  agreed to terminate his contract after just three games with the team.  Here's your sports on the O.P. Anthony Show.  Today, they will increase ticket prices for about half of Fenway Park by an average  Although, fucking Allen Iverson parted ways with the Memphis team there.  He plays with the Sixers.  He's Sixers.  That's like, I don't even know how many teams he's going now.  I know he played for Denver and now Memphis.  He played for the Grizzlies.  What?  The Grizzlies.  That's his Grizzlies? 
[01:43:00]  I have no idea.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, look at me.  He played three games with the team and they said goodbye to Iverson.  Now, there's rumors that the Knicks might pick them up.  Football, Bruin, Hockey and Felger and Maserati afternoons 2 to 6.  Your next Sports Hub headlines in 20 minutes.  Getting you where you need to go.  It's traffic on 98.5 The Sports Hub.  Pretty tough ride out there this morning.  Very heavy delay in South of Town on Route 3 in the expressway.  Route 3.  Route 3.  They've got to be local, right?  I know that.  Let's make sure we're local.  I'll tell you where there's not traffic. 
[01:43:30]  On the way to my chickopee show.  Oh, boy, is there not traffic going there.  Oh, no.  For real?  Oh, boy.  Boston's doing great.  Chickopee, not so good.  Why does Bill Blumerize make you play all over the place?  Just focus on one.  Yeah.  Because people are going to go see you in Boston that probably live close to Chickopee.  It's so bizarre, the scheduling.  Time to get in the game. 
[01:44:00]  Call 617-779-0985.  Or hit the studio with instant feedback at 98.5, thesportshub.com.  Oh, I'm afraid of that word.  What?  Toucher and Rich.  Instant feedback.  Yeah, I know.  98.5, the Sports Hub.  Boston's new home for sports.  We are Toucher and Rich.  We're certainly Craig Clark, John Wallach.  My name is Fred Toucher.  And Jim Norton's coming to the Wilbur Theater.  Two shows on Saturday, November 28th.  Obviously, one of the best stand-ups out there. 
[01:44:30]  And he happens to be a member of one of the great radio shows of all time.  And it's fortunate that we were able to get a relationship going with these guys.  It's Opie and Anthony.  They're on XM Sirius.  We are on their lines.  Yeah, we'll try not to curse.  Yeah, we'll be good.  Don't curse.  We'll try not to.  We'll be good boys.  Toucher and Rich, it's been a while.  How are you guys, man?  We're fantastic.  This is a third round of giving people an opportunity to tell us how much we suck.  It was when we first came to Boston, we had part-time DJs and wannabe guys telling us 
[01:45:00]  how we would never make it in this market.  It's too provincial.  And we did that.  And then when the move happened in the mornings and we took over for you guys, everyone said  how much we sucked in comparison to you.  And then when sports came about, a whole new fresh crop of people telling them how much  we suck and we'll never make it in this format.  Well, how much has this show changed since you guys are over doing a sports format? 
[01:45:30]  Has it changed a lot or is it pretty much the same thing, just for more sports updates  on the breaks?  I think that it's changed.  I think that it's 60% sports now and 40%.  We try to come at it from a little bit of a different angle than usual, but...  Was that a pain they asked for you, though?  Like trying to incorporate what you guys do and incorporate sports into it?  I don't know, Richard.  Not really.  I mean, we talked a lot of sports on the last show and we've got this nerd in our studio  now who knows all about everything Boston sports. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, really?  You ought to get one of those stats guys.  You ought to get one of those stats guys.  They brought in a mathematician with some credibility in the market.  Hey, guys, money's good.  Trust me.  A sports dummy.  I love it.  Is he a stat guy or is he just a board op with Google?  Oh, he actually knows everything.  Oh, you guys are right.  Yeah, he's the guy from Revenge of the Nerds.  I mean, he did it.  Well, you know that in 1947.  Which one was your favorite?  I liked Lamar.  I thought he was kind of attractive. 
[01:46:30]  He might be gay.  We haven't gotten through all that yet.  Damn, man.  You guys are like cockroaches over there just surviving all the nukes that have gone on  over there in Boston.  Yeah, plus I'm getting a tremendous amount of feedback.  Are you getting that?  Is that going on over there?  There's like an echo.  Dan, why do we have an echo?  Oh, damn.  Oh, boy, there's an echo.  Yeah.  Echo.  Echo.  We can actually hear you guys really well.  Yeah, we're perfect over here.  You have a staff of people that care about you.  No, we don't. 
[01:47:00]  A homosexual, a drunk, and a twink.  That's what we have.  And that's just us three.  So I see that Jim is doing a lot of stuff.  He's doing the Leno stuff, and he's had success with the books.  That's got to be helping you guys out, right?  Anything.  Oh, yes.  Anything.  It's about time we get to jump on Jimmy's coattails.  Yeah, I've dragged them one foot so far.  I am the wrong coattails to jump on if you're looking for a free ticket. 
[01:47:30]  I know that you guys were having some problems when you were on the air here.  You were having some problems over there.  You didn't feel like you were getting respected as much as some of the other shows.  Has some of that improved?  We were doing that back then, too.  Yeah.  We're still just bitching and complaining.  We're still just begging for respect in this business.  It's never going to happen.  We understand that now, I guess.  No, we're forever going to be those dopey shock jocks that did the bad thing in church.  Yeah, there was just a big campaign here, like the new SiriusXM commercial, and we wanted 
[01:48:00]  to be on the front page of the website, but we weren't.  But we did convince them to take the jazz channel off the front page and put us on the  front page.  Well, half of us on the front page, but that's getting too inside.  Hey, how did Boston elect Mayor Menino again?  Are you guys talking about that?  Yeah, it's fifth term.  What is that about?  It wasn't much of a surprise.  Holding it like a pope, that office.  Jesus, come on.  Every time he says something, we play the audio on our show, we're just amazed by how horrible  he speaks.  Well, he also is the guy who, remember when they were doing that promotion for Adult Swim for 
[01:48:30]  the Aqua Teen Hogwarts?  Yes.  He's the one guy that freaked out about that.  In any of the cities, they were doing it.  Yeah, the only mayor that couldn't figure it out.  He thought it was some kind of terrorism.  Terrorist Lightbrite.  Yeah, Lightbrite.  Yeah, I remember we were on the air, and we're looking at it, and we're like, hey, that's  the thing from the cartoon, and they've got bomb squads around a Lightbrite, literally  a Lightbrite, that's running on one AAA battery. 
[01:49:00]  And what's kind of funny is we figured it out.  We were like, listen, this is a promotion for this Aqua Teen movie, and we had some  people call some of the news, and some people call whatever, and it went an entire 24 hours  before anyone even copped to knowing what it was.  I want the SWAT team down there.  We got to get the SWAT.  All right, no, no, mayor, relax.  It's okay.  One of the greatest stories in Boston history.  That one was a good one.  And the guy from Adult Swim had to step down. 
[01:49:30]  He actually, I think, quit.  Ridiculous.  Which he shouldn't have had to.  It cost him, what, like $3 million or something like that?  Yeah, and that movie only made like 2.5.  Yeah, he lost money on his promotion.  Right.  Now, are you there?  What happened?  All right, now you're there.  Now we're back with it.  This is a disaster on our end.  You guys, when you speak, you sound like Darth Vader.  It's like the Dark Lords are on the line with us.  In our voices.  We sound like we're in a toilet.  Jim Norton, by the way, from the opening Anthony show, is going to be here Saturday, November 28th at the Wilbur Theater. 
[01:50:00]  And don't forget Friday.  This is the gig I'm really proud of.  I'm doing Chick-A-Pee, the hooky-lau restaurant.  It's stupid.  There's only one show now.  It's hard to believe that two shows wouldn't sell out over a Chinese eatery.  But Blumenreich is unbelievable.  I need you to do the Rape Crisis Center before you shoot into the Wilbur Theater.  So, wait.  So, Chick-A-Pee and you're playing a restaurant?  Dude, it's upstairs. 
[01:50:30]  He's had the room for many years.  And, yeah, it's the hooky-lau restaurant.  It's actually a good gig, but it's just nobody knows about it.  Can you guys tell Jim Norton that he's on Jay Leno?  Because I don't think he understands that yet.  He's still playing at restaurants.  Yeah, you've got to keep modest, Jim.  Good for you.  So, you know, play the gigs and help out the guys that were there throughout your career.  Yeah, I really do.  I'm basically just standing in the men's room of an Arby's doing 20 minutes.  Stupid Blumenreich.  He does that so he can cancel a show and then screw you on the guarantee.  It's like, I know what you're doing, Bill. 
[01:51:00]  He ties in all five shows.  Why are you eating draw well at the hooky-lau?  It's like, nobody does.  It's 600 seats over a Chinese restaurant.  It's impossible to sell it out.  Because you're going to sell out the Wilbur Theater to shows, and the Wilbur Theater is  where everyone plays.  It's where the big comedians play.  Yeah, the Wilbur's a great gig.  I mean, it's like, I've done it before.  I have sold it before.  But this time, he tries to tie in the hooky-lau.  He's just, Bill, Bill, it's really, he's just terrible.  I hate that name.  Don't say it again.  You have to hate the name hooky-lau.  It's just that the spickle of the food is pretty good. 
[01:51:30]  Watch me get food poisoning.  I'll be vomiting.  I'll have to cancel my Wilbur Theater show.  So the 30 people that showed up at the Chinese eatery got to see my last show in Boston.  You're going to get there, and it's just going to be the promoter's uncle.  Yeah, and three Asians.  Three guys that don't speak English just kind of staring at me, dragging a horse through the  room.  Bloomin' Rung should be just beaten with a rock.  He really is the worst.  I had to fight for a hotel room.  He's like, it's not in the budget.  I'm like, just put me in.  It's not in the budget. 
[01:52:00]  So yeah, I'm doing that, and then I'm doing the Wilbur Theater.  Where are you guys broadcasting out of?  Are you in the same location, or do they move you?  Same place.  We're in the same exact place.  They just kind of gave it a new paint job.  Put sports pictures of the walls instead of the rock artists.  That's really true.  Fat heads.  Yes, they spent a high dollar just ordering fat heads off TV.  That's right.  But the thing is, is one of our Tom Brady ones only came with half the fat heads, so literally  we have his crotch hanging on the wall.  And nothing else.  You know what they did is that they literally painted the walls to, I believe, what they thought 
[01:52:30]  was a more masculine color.  I'm not kidding.  And then to make us aware that we were speaking of the four major sports franchises the majority  of the time, there is those logos to remind us that indeed that is what we are here to  do.  Ah, so you don't forget.  Lest you forget, there are, what, you got your Red Sox up there, you got your Celtics,  your Bruins.  You got your Bruins, and you got your Pats.  Yeah, and they've locked up the room where all the CDs were.  It's a constant lockdown because, you know, everyone's going to want to go after those 
[01:53:00]  Foreigner CDs from 25 years ago.  Start to pilfer.  In that format.  Yeah, and I don't know what they did with all the gold records and everything that are  up here, but so someone has a pretty fine Billy Joel stranger.  It's a stranger.  Remember when that happened at NAW?  Jeez, man.  All that stuff disappeared?  Yep, yeah.  When they were changing formats?  Yeah, the largest rock and roll library in America turned into...  Hey, you guys happy that the Yankees won the World Series, or what?  Oh, ecstatic. 
[01:53:30]  Totally awesome.  I follow you guys on Twitter, so I got to hear, I got Anthony's constant breakdown.  Yes, I was getting very angry with people.  Yeah, and I hope you, congratulations on the Islanders, my friend.  The Islanders, people are beating me up, but this Islander team, I'm telling you, it's  a good team, and you're going to see that the second half of the season.  They're better than 16 teams, I think, in the NHL right now, and we beat your Bruins  last night.  They're way better than the Bruins right now.  Yeah, I know the Bruins are, yeah, they're rough this year, big time. 
[01:54:00]  They're injured.  How about the Devils?  I don't follow hockey at all.  I have no idea who plays where.  Hockey is these...  What's your favorite sport, you guys?  Toucher.  To go to live is hockey.  Absolutely.  And I'm a basketball fan, which is...  Yeah, hey, in Boston, it's easy, but in New York...  Well, see, I couldn't even name the starting lineup of the Knicks.  That's how far out of basketball I am these days.  Well, here's the thing about basketball, is if you turn a game on, invariably it's going  to be a commercial or people standing around looking at a ref. 
[01:54:30]  If you turn on a hockey game, it's almost constant motion.  They're actually playing for the allotted period of time, so that's why when you go to  the game, it's all your senses.  You sit there and there's actually something constantly happening, and at the end of the game,  you don't have to sit through a million stoppages while people are fouling.  Thank God, yeah.  A team in the NBA gets a 20-point first half lead, and it doesn't matter at all.  You can turn the game off for 45 minutes, turn it back on, and then the other team's  got a 10-point lead.  That's why I hate basketball.  I'm not a basketball fan at all, because to me...  Well, the wrong color is playing. 
[01:55:00]  No, to me, like...  You really should follow hockey.  You would really appreciate it.  To me, the climax of a game, the excitement is when your team scores, and when they do  it every few seconds, it's just not exciting.  And then the end, of course, with the fouling and this, the last two minutes takes forever.  I'd rather watch, you know, I'd rather sit out.  I like going to live baseball games.  It's just kind of fun on a nice day to sit there and, you know, pay too much money for 
[01:55:30]  beer and hot dogs.  But is there a sport with better characters, or even thugs for that matter, to just sit  and observe?  I mean, obviously, Stefan Marbury in New York has been pretty funny, even though he's not  even playing, showing up to games and being escorted out because he didn't have a ticket.  But I don't know if you even saw it.  You got Ron Artest this past weekend ripping off the shoe of a guy from the Houston Rockets  and throwing it in the stands.  That's true, too.  What's going on?  You know, they're gangsters, man.  There's literally people that if they weren't playing basketball, were being incarcerated. 
[01:56:00]  Yes, of course.  And even though they are playing, they're probably going to wind up being incarcerated.  I'm a big basketball fan, though.  You should see me.  I walk around with my matching Shaq Attack hat and shirt.  Just to show everyone that I'm really into the sport.  I am being told that we have to let you go.  All right.  I was going to ask you about Bill Belichick.  You guys still beating him up?  Yes.  Yes.  I was going to ask you about that.  Here's why Sports Talk Radio in a way rules.  Yeah.  Yesterday was the easiest show I've done in my entire life. 
[01:56:30]  Must have been, yeah.  My entire career.  The phones, from the minute we sat down to the minute we left, we're all lined up.  Everyone wants to talk about it.  What the hell do I have to say?  I just, you know, hey, it was stupid.  He's got this God complex.  But the great thing about Belichick in this town is there is a fraction of people that it's like the Easter Bunny or some kind of weird defying of logic that he's not.  No, I can't accept he made a mistake.  He's perfect.  Dad didn't love me.  Belichick is the dad I never had. 
[01:57:00]  If I met him, he would think I was the greatest.  And they get angry.  And they're mad at Rodney Harrison for saying something.  And they're mad at Teddy Bruschi.  And they're like, traitors.  Backstab.  Belichick above you.  Make no mistake.  And then there's an article, and I'm screwing everything I just said, but there's an article in today's paper that you'll want to talk about sports going too far.  Here's a section of the article.  When Tony Dungy is speaking about football and Rob's a sharp pitchfork, Navy pilot named Brian Burke ambled to the computer in his Retson, Virginia home so he could determine if Belichick had made the right decision. 
[01:57:30]  The Zeus program, developed by a pair of champion backgammon players, was made to simulate specific football situations and spit out the probability.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  That's exactly, Wallach.  What's wrong with that?  That's a sports nerd, by the way.  That's exactly what I want to do.  No problem with that.  That's what I want to do with my free time is get some guy in his basement statistical analysis from a backgammon game.  The Zeus program is something from a bad Rutger Hauer movie. 
[01:58:00]  It's horrible.  Yeah, it's war games.  The Whopper.  Why don't you just unplug the guy?  Right.  And they're saying that the guy is a single father and he had nothing to do when the kids went to bed, so he decided to make up this computer program.  Oh, there's things to do, sir.  There's things to do.  There's a lot of things.  The kids are in bed.  The kids are in bed.  I don't know what to do.  I think I'll develop some kind of statistical analysis to find out if people are punting in the right situations. 
[01:58:30]  No, I can think of a few things that you could do.  Yeah.  I've seen a few videos myself.  All right, my friends.  Thank you guys very much, man.  No, thank you.  And Jim Norton, obviously always great.  Saturday, November 28th at the Wilbur Theater for two shows.  And he's Chicopee before that at a Chinese restaurant.  Yes, the Hu Kilao restaurant where I'll be reenacting horse gag with an egg roll.  And you can check out ONA at 6 a.m. Eastern, Sirius 197XM202 and repealies throughout the day. 
[01:59:00]  Thanks, guys, so much.  All right, take care, guys.  Let's leave it out there.  Good talking.  Thank you, Matt.  Toucher and Rich from Boston there.  Funny guys, man.  These idiot computers.  Are we off?  Now we can get back to cursing?  How hard is that?  Dude.  Do you consciously have to think?  I wrote a note.  I was like, don't curse.  Did you see my note?  Don't curse.  No.  I got a fucker in.  No way.  By accident.  No.  Yeah, and I didn't want to do that to them.  I was listening.  I swear to you.  I wrote it down.  I said fucker.  I almost said clithood four times. 
[01:59:30]  You know what?  Those guys have always been supportive up there.  They have been.  They're great.  I don't even know.  What's the station called now?  For real?  I don't know.  Are they still on BCN?  The old BCN.  The old BCN.  And it's not even 104.1 anymore.  Aren't they on 98.5 up there?  Is that true?  Why don't you just say it, Steve?  98.5, the sports hub.  Write it down.  There you go.  For everybody in the Boston area.  Oh, no.  Okay, thank you.  You got your friend Bob Levy's here, Jamie. 
[02:00:00]  Yes, Bob's a funny dude, man.  And we also got...  We were trying to do the shit radio bit with Sam.  Oh, good.  So can we do that next with Bob Levy?  Yes.  He'll fit in with that.  Yeah, of course he will.  Yeah, of course he will.  All right, let's take a break.  I'm going to pay you.  Yeah, man, man, man, man.  Yeah.  Arrgh.  Today, Star Trek released on Blu-ray, motherfucker. 
[02:00:30]  Boo.  And Fight Club released on Blu-ray.  Oh, I like that one.  For the first time ever on Blu-ray, it's the 10-year anniversary of Fight Club.  What do you get for the 10-year anniversary?  You know, I really don't know.  I don't really think it's packed with a lot of special features, considering the price  point.  It's only like 18 bucks, so you can't go wrong.  That's nice.  Especially for a Blu-ray.  I hear they got Brad Pitt's, like, splooge.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's part of the whole fucking... 
[02:01:00]  Really?  Travolta gives it his wig glue.  That was a big secret they revealed.  Gotta say hi to Bob Levy in studio.  What's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  Bobby, what are you promoting right off the bat?  A lot of shitty gigs this week.  Oh, shit.  I've never heard of these places.  Exactly.  That's why we have them here.  Bobby, tomorrow is at...  If anyone hasn't seen Levy, he's fucking hilarious.  I do a good show.  I do.  And it's very dirty.  It's a lot of crowd work.  It's very funny.  Tomorrow, November 18th, he's at Mojo 13. 
[02:01:30]  In Wilmington, Delaware.  In Wilmington, Delaware.  What's Mojo 13 all about?  It's like a rock club, but it's a fun place.  All right, cool.  Now, Thursday the 19th is a good gig.  Tailgater's Bar and Grill in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania.  You're the king of the restaurant, sir.  Oh, shit, yeah.  I'm also the cook at these places when I'm there.  People are eating.  You're making them laugh.  That's right.  Friday, November 20th.  Here we go.  Orchard's Restaurant.  But at least it's a cool city.  Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. 
[02:02:00]  This is the end of the Killers of Comedy Tour this weekend.  So you know you've got to end it in Chambersburg and East Greenville, PA.  Yeah.  Which we're going to be at.  Bob, where are these?  I took Colin to Chambersburg, and he loved it because they put you in a room with a lot of books.  Yeah.  And he's looking around.  He goes, this is your kryptonite, isn't it?  Because he owns them a stupid buck.  We're eating like this.  It's a great restaurant.  The food is great.  And they've got a great place to do it.  And then I'm just going to start doing comedy clubs again, you know?  Yeah.  And then Saturday is the East Greenville Company Social Hall. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  This is your kryptonite, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  There's a bunch of books.  A bunch of books.  I couldn't stay in a room.  I go, Colin, I've got to get out of this fucking room.  I didn't know what it was.  And then he goes, look around.  There's books.  Books.  He left me a message today.  I listened to it twice.  And I go, did I give a retarded guy my number?  Yes.  Because at the end, I didn't know.  I listened to it twice.  And then at the end, he goes, it's Colin.  Call me back.  Otherwise, you'd think a retarded guy called you.  He was telling me, all he does is he reports on what an ass Levy is on the road. 
[02:03:00]  I was just fucking, Bob.  Oh, an ass.  I am.  The fucking idiot.  We did this, the hooky thing that you're doing at a Chinese restaurant.  You're making fun of me, you fuck?  And then we do that.  We come home from it, right?  It's freezing, right?  I don't know when the fuck it was.  He picks up this big snowball like this.  And he thinks he's going to throw it at me.  And it's going to break on my leg.  And everyone's going to laugh, you know?  So he grabs it.  And he's like, and you hear it hit my knee, and you hear it clink. 
[02:03:30]  And I'm like, I couldn't even fucking walk.  I'm like, you fucking old asshole, you.  What was the metal in it?  No, it was freezing.  It was fucking 10 degrees.  Iceberg in him.  Yeah, it was basically, yeah.  Fucking ice pool.  I think it sucked the Titanic.  He fucking threw it at me.  Douche.  Colin really is an aggressive cunt.  Yeah, he is.  He's got some anger issues, huh?  Oh, he's the worst.  Oh, totally.  He stays at my house.  It's funny.  He just comes down, like me and my wife are watching TV.  He comes down in his boxer shorts.  You're like, what the fuck's the matter with you?  Put your pants on, you creep. 
[02:04:00]  That's a great picture.  Danny just popped up.  Wow.  The young Colin Quinn.  Look at him from the 80s with his well-clothed hair.  What was her?  He's next to Kari Wurr.  Thank you.  Yeah, that chick was hot.  He never got her, he said.  He never got her.  She seemed like she would be easy.  I'm not full-length at trying, I bet.  I know.  She seems easy, though.  Stupid Colin, we used to argue, because he thinks he was so beautiful back then.  I was like, dude, you were a seven.  He's like, I was a nine.  I'm like, you weren't a fucking nine.  He looks handsome in that picture.  Compared to now.  Yeah.  I mean, now he's a fucking mess. 
[02:04:30]  And now he's like...  As opposed to now?  When he gets 50, I was like, let's go do something for your birthday.  And he goes, I'm going to another country.  He didn't want to be in his country at 50.  You know, he's such a mess.  We lost Ken over.  I mean, we're looking at remote control pictures.  Now I've got to get him through that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm sure he's going to be really upset, but he's going to want to go to Germany or  something for fucking three weeks to get over this.  He's out of his mind.  Colin is kind of a fucking...  I never realized what a creep he was.  He is.  He's a young picture. 
[02:05:00]  But he's an idiot.  He's trying to look sexy.  What is he doing?  Kind of like the dark, mysterious stare.  There's one of him.  Go back one.  I know this is visual, but you know.  The one next to Ken over.  Yeah, that one.  That's from one of his shows.  Look at his hair.  He's got like...  He looks like Kenickie from fucking Greece.  Hey.  Hey, you're a Hickey from Kenickie.  You're better than a whole my card or something.  Look at that hair and look.  Is that his arm kind of behind his head? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, it's like backwards.  He's holding the back of his neck like he's...  Yeah.  Your wrists don't bend like that unless you're jerking off a fucking Japanese tourist.  Look at his fucking wrist.  Look at that.  How do you get it like that?  That is really bad.  Did Colin get a lot of fucking pussy back then?  How could he?  I don't know because he got the...  He has...  He was on a huge MTV show.  Of course he did.  And he's got this 80s look to him that like, you know, he could be at a Duran Duran show.  Yeah.  But I don't think he did.  I think he was just like...  Like he would just babble so much that the girls would just walk away after a while. 
[02:06:00]  Shut up.  Exactly.  I think he was old for the 80s, really.  Old for the 80s.  When Patrice told him he was getting old man ears, that they were getting all big old  man ears and fucking killed him.  I think he got sad over that one.  Oh, he killed him.  He got sad over a lot of things.  You can't say a lot of things around him.  Yeah.  You just let him sit there on the couch.  Like he used to get mad at me because I had...  You remember Twitchell's?  I had him and Lewis over.  I mean, him and Colin over one day.  And like Twitchell's gets on my nerves like, because he moves, you know? 
[02:06:30]  No shit.  And he's annoying.  Like he's moving.  And I'm like, stop fucking moving because I got to take a pill.  You know?  And Colin's like, the guy's got Tourette's.  Would you let him be?  And I'm like, well, I don't want to look at this shit.  Put him outside.  Yeah, he's getting away from me.  Let me invite him over.  What are you doing?  How are you doing, Levy?  You brought him over.  You invited him.  You brought him.  But all he talks about is how he won't follow you on the road.  He just refuses.  No, but we have fun on the road.  You know, you go up and do 25.  I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean? 
[02:07:00]  His manager doesn't want him to go on the road.  I don't know why.  They want him to do the comedy cell for $10 every night and not go on the road.  You know?  Let's go on the road and have fun.  He likes to go on the road.  He really should.  He's fucking great.  He's fucking hilarious.  And he's fun to room with.  He fucking throws shit at you.  You guys share a room?  No, we don't share a room, buddy.  Fuck, it's a college?  Jesus Christ.  Colin.  I'm getting a top bunk.  It's fun with him.  He's a good guy.  One of the best guys in the business.  We love Colin.  You know?  And he doesn't drink.  And it helps me drink less. 
[02:07:30]  Is that where you're at now?  Yeah.  I'm trying to slow down.  You're just drinking less?  Yeah.  It's probably a silly question, but did Colin, like, ever drink?  I think he did.  Was there problems?  I don't know if he had problems or if he just didn't feel like drinking.  I don't know what his...  I should actually really ask him about things.  I know he doesn't really drink.  He's so Irish.  He should just be a drunk.  Yeah.  I think he used to.  He fits the bill.  I think it's been like 20 or 25 years since he's done anything.  He probably had a bad night.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was so...  He quit, like, drugs and drinking that same night, you know? 
[02:08:00]  He had a bad night.  You know, you think it's a chick and then you fucking see a cock and you're like, all right,  I got to stop drinking.  That's not what motivated me to stop.  That just motivated me to get darker tint on my windows.  That's funny about him.  At the beginning, we used to pull it in front of his house and he used to put the fucking  tint up, you know, in front of it and then he'd go, give me $10 and a couple of cigarettes  and I'm like, all right, what do you need?  And he goes, I'm going to go get a hooker and bring her back to my car.  I would use the...  I've told this story before.  In the drive, I would use the sun blocker. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, you put it in the windshield to keep the sun from going on his suit.  And you would do it in the driveway of your parents' house.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  In case my mother looked out the window.  And his parents thought he was a nice boy for years.  They're like, Jimmy, your friend's here.  They were bamboozled.  Corruption.  They liked all my friends.  They loved Bobby.  They loved Otto.  The only friend they didn't like was Voss.  Really?  They like him now.  That makes sense.  But he makes the worst...  Because they probably think it's the paper boy coming to the house.  They got to pay their little vest.  He makes the worst first impression of anybody. 
[02:09:00]  Why is that?  I don't...  He's an abrasive prick.  He's an angry little fucking man.  Ah, first of all.  And there's no second of all.  But he's just...  He's just inappropriately sarcastic.  Yeah.  Like, oh, it's nice you and Jimmy are doing a gig.  Well, it's nice for him.  Thanks.  My mother.  Great kid you got here.  He just had no boundaries because he was older than most of our parents.  Every comedian you work with, they're like, you know Voss?  And I'm like, oh yeah, he's a good guy. 
[02:09:30]  He goes, he was a dick to me last week.  Every...  Why is that?  This week I happen to be...  He doesn't seem to be that type.  I don't know.  Jim hated him when he first met him.  Florentine?  I hated him.  My first time I met Voss, I was doing a gig with him and Vinnie Brand.  And it was...  Was it the curly-haired Voss?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Wow.  The crack teeth?  Yeah, it was AIDS teeth.  Oh, my God.  It was fucking...  He cracked them in a black-eyed sock.  Crystal meth Voss.  And I was doing a gig with him and Vinnie, and I was only getting 50 bucks for it, but  the gig got canceled.  So the guy's like, I'll give you all 50. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  And that was what all I was getting, so I was happy.  And Voss is like, you know, you're lucky we're giving you anything.  You were only supposed to get 50.  We ought to take it.  I'm like, fuck you, dude.  And he meant it?  Of course he meant it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's the picture there with his soul glow hair cut.  Soul glow.  Look at that fucking hair.  That's when we met him.  He was...  It was...  Look at him.  He...  How did you not just punch him?  You wanted to.  He thinks he's happening in that photo right there.  Yeah, he really does.  He really thinks he's ready for modeling.  And he had fucking...  He would wear, like, the workout pants. 
[02:10:30]  He really was fucking repulsive.  Who thought he could have been worse than he is now?  But he was.  Yeah.  He improved.  He's a shining star now compared to that.  What a wreck.  Look at that fucking Voss.  I think he's in tomorrow for Jimmy, because Jimmy's doing a lineup tomorrow night.  Yeah.  And he hooks up with the likes of a Bonnie.  Yeah.  See, that's what it is.  If they had a kid and that shit, look at that.  Now she's at home.  Now he's got to go out in the room.  He goes, got to get me some gigs. 
[02:11:00]  I need to make money now.  And she's saying, no.  He's too old.  She's staying home and I think she's sleeping with the neighbor.  He's like always paranoid that she's fucking other guys and stuff.  Where's he at?  Does he believe that's his kid finally?  Dude, he thought for years that I fucked his ex-wife.  He really thought...  Really?  He really thought...  Fuck you.  I'm like, Rich...  Fuck my ex-wife?  He really did.  He just didn't have the courage of Jake LaMotta to throw a punch.  He fucking found Dangerfield matches in her apartment one time.  Literally thought that I was fucking... 
[02:11:30]  Maybe Rodney fucked her.  Yeah, exactly.  That's hilarious.  She's a chariot of the waiter.  Somebody fucked her.  Who was it?  I love the story he was telling when he was here once about the neighbor came up and started  talking because Rich had new tiles put in his kitchen.  And his neighbor came over and said like...  That's where he's got those teeth from.  There were so few left over.  And the neighbor's talking about it.  He goes, yeah, you got a nice tile in your kitchen. 
[02:12:00]  You know, the new tile and stuff.  And Rich is like, oh, thanks.  He didn't think anything about it.  And then he's stewing here going, how would the neighbor know what my new tiles look like?  When did he come in here?  Because it was in my house.  I go, what was it?  He goes, I don't remember if I ever invited him in or told him the tiles.  Hey, do you think he's going to have a Bonnie?  You think he's...  It's exhausting.  And then of course we're just like, yes, he's fucking your wife.  Because it's easier to just say yes.  Yeah.  People tell me, you got to look behind your Bob Levy.  That's Vossapedia on the wall.  Yeah, all those words.  We finally gave up. 
[02:12:30]  That whole thing?  That whole thing?  That's all the stuff he mispronounced on our show.  Yeah, he's done with me, which I'm really happy about.  You know?  He calls me.  I'm like, thank God.  I was having such a fucking bad day until you called you stupid fuck.  But he is dumb.  He's unbelievably stupid.  He is.  Yeah.  We're proud of that list.  That is a fucking huge list.  But it's all real things.  It goes from the ceiling to the fucking floor.  It's bigger than him.  It's like when you chart a kid, but it's like, remember when you were this dumb? 
[02:13:00]  You're going to get dumb real quick in about a year.  Jimmy, give us a couple, because we haven't gone to the list in a while.  Just take that on the mic.  Jimmy will give you a couple of Rich Voss's gems.  There's a lot of words on each page.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He said stupid things.  Okay.  Look how happy he is.  Instead of oatmeal, he called it oatmeal.  Oatmeal, yeah.  For Barack Obama, he called him obok.  Of course, instead of library, there's library.  Library. 
[02:13:30]  That's a nice juvenile thing to say.  Oh, my God.  Pasketti.  Hysterectomial.  Instead of a hysterectomy, which is what his mother should have had before.  Oh, is he fucking stupid?  The meal.  Oh, this is crazy.  Clockwork Orange.  Clockworth Orange.  Have you ever seen a movie Clockworth Orange?  No.  Dummy.  Not Rupert.  Rupert Pumpkin instead of his comedic inspiration, Rupert Pumpkin. 
[02:14:00]  Sherlock Holmes.  And they're all true in their Sherlock Holmes.  I forgot about Sherlock Holmes.  They'll put an S on the back of things that don't need it, and then they'll take the S  off things that need it.  It's because of the teeth.  They're too big.  They're like, they hang out too long.  You know, you can't get...  You see how far they come down?  Yeah.  They're like, they didn't do them right.  You should trim them.  You should get them trimmed.  Unless he's in the wild, he can't chew them down.  Knocking trees down.  Usually that keeps them in check.  We got a classic from Voss. 
[02:14:30]  It's quick.  Travis has got one for us.  Holy shit, Rich.  Oh my God.  This is quite a little...  It's just the greatest thing.  A horse's ass picture.  It says Rich Voss and then a plug for Jimmy's show.  Quite a po-fa.  And a bunch of gay followers.  Po-what?  Po-fa.  What's that word?  Po-fa.  How great is it going to be when you hear that clip every time a caller comes? 
[02:15:00]  Po-fa.  Hey, where's my fa?  Oh my God.  What a fucking idiot.  You should have lost my fa.  Po-fa.  There you go.  The famous Po-fa.  Voss is calling in a few minutes.  He had to drop his car off at the shop.  It's always at the shop.  It's always at the fucking shop.  Is that still that fucking Mercedes-Benz he bought or whatever the fuck?  Because he buys everything online.  That's what I think.  I know you get some good deals online, but Voss doesn't have to do that online.  He buys his phones online. 
[02:15:30]  He bought his teeth online.  He came from horse.com.  Never gets old.  Yeah, and he's not a fucking...  He's not a motorhead guy where he's going to be under the hood.  That's the guy that buys it.  You buy it online.  Whatever goes wrong, you can fix it yourself.  Or if you want to fix a rubber or something to restore.  Or, it's not him.  He can't fucking do that.  He'll drive him.  He's got to go to the shop.  And I'm sure they just see him coming.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they must see him going.  Here comes stupid.  Yeah, here comes teeth McGillicuddy. 
[02:16:00]  Here comes that guy eating an apple again.  Why don't we play this tasing clip as we wait for Voss?  Nice.  This is a good one.  I love a good tasing.  72-year-old woman.  72?  What could she have possibly done?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Step back, and I'm going to change you.  He's going to change the sanity between you and all, man.  3-17, I need three or four out, please.  Step back. 
[02:16:30]  Step back, and you're going to be changed, man.  Step back, and you're going to be changed, man. 
[02:17:00]  Step back.  Step back.  Step back, and you're going to be changed, man.  Put your hands on the back.  Put your hands on the back.  I'm trying.  Put your hands on the back.  Does she say, I'm trying?  I'm trying.  She sounded like Voss at one time.  She made that horse noise.  She got 40 Gs for that? 
[02:17:30]  Is that her?  Why couldn't they fucking get under control without the taser?  Why couldn't they just grab it by a medical alert, Brittany, and just fucking pull it to the ground?  I mean, what the fuck?  You're going to short it out?  Yeah.  A 72-year-old lady can't take her down with a clothesline?  Right.  Just kick her in the cunt.  Let's say hi to Colin Quinn.  Colin!  Were you guys rousing me?  No.  A little bit.  No, it was a few questions, I guess, we had about, or I had about you from the past that I just never bothered asking you, I guess. 
[02:18:00]  You know, whether you drank.  Yeah, we want to know if you ever drank.  No, never.  For real?  No.  Come on.  Didn't you stop like 25 years ago?  Yeah.  So you drank.  And I bet you did coke, too.  Nah, not that much.  Not too much.  Not that much.  Enough to keep me skinny.  What Ant wanted to know, we were looking at old pictures of you, and he wanted us to know if you fucked a lot of girls. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, did you get a lot of chicks?  I thought you were pretty dreamy back then.  I did.  I did.  I was a little bit crazy.  Whoa, whoa.  What did you call him in that photo?  I said you looked 80s, like you could go to a Duran Duran show.  You said you looked like Kenickie from Greece.  Oh, one picture, you looked like Kenickie from Greece.  Yeah, I take that as a compliment that it is.  Yeah, the leather jacket.  The T-birds on the back.  My friend, Jeff Conway.  Yeah, it was just my friend, Jeff Conway.  That's all you hear.  The same story is over and over. 
[02:19:00]  We can get Jeff Conway on the phone.  I go, why?  The guy can't even talk anymore.  We want to fucking talk to him.  Jeff Conway's his friend?  Yeah, but he never answers the phone when he calls.  He goes, all right, Jeff, I'll talk to you soon.  And you never got Carrie Whirr?  No, we had like a kind of agreement to all three of us to just fuck around with whoever we wanted  and then, you know, cover each other's backs.  Yeah.  Hey, Ken Ober, Colin.  Jesus.  Sorry to hear that.  What a drag.  For real.  Yeah.  That's a fucking drag.  I know.  Bob, you don't know who that is, but he was a comedian friend of mine that was on for a... 
[02:19:30]  I know, Colin.  Bob's like, I'm so sorry.  Who's Ken Ober?  He goes back and asks, Christine, who's Ken Ober?  Jesus.  I told him how, like, you'll just give me Levy's idiotic moment reports as I drive you home.  And Bob told me one that you hadn't told me.  You guys went into a gig and there was a lot of books in the room and you said, this is your kryptonite, isn't it?  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  The one gig, only Levy could take us to a gig.  We're sitting in the green room.  It's thousands of books. 
[02:20:00]  It was so bizarre.  I was all thinking they were all trying to mock him.  Then another time we were at the airport and we were going to a gig.  And I go, yeah, I'm going to pick up a book because we had to go on the plane.  And he goes, come on, what the fuck are you doing?  He thought I was trying to be, like, ball breaking, like funny, like, ha, ha, ha.  No, I'm really getting a book, dummy.  No, what he was really doing was stalking a woman.  That's what he was doing, if you want to know the truth.  Well, he's got a point there.  Yes.  And I said, do you really want it to end this way when you go, it doesn't have to go this way, you know, and they're dragging you out in handcuffs. 
[02:20:30]  You know, you're all over that woman, you creepy fuck, and you know that.  I guess it's two sides to every story.  Hey, what about me and Norton went to a ground last night, Anthony?  I want to hear your impression of Billy Crystal.  What?  Stupid Billy Crystal?  Oh, you guys were hanging with Billy Crystal last night?  No.  I was watching.  I was watching.  Robin was at the cellar.  Was he doing the black guy?  No, no, he wasn't there. 
[02:21:00]  Robin was at the cellar.  So Colin and I left together in the cab.  I was just talking about Robin, which segued into Billy.  And I was like, yeah, Anthony loves him.  And I once forget Paris yesterday again.  I hate when he does, when he does the black soul guy.  You know, when a Katrina hit, I lost my trumpet.  And I, oh, stop it.  You just see some fucking obviously Jewish guy on stage trying to be a black guy.  It's the worst thing.  You might as well put blackface on and sing Mammy.  It's that insulting. 
[02:21:30]  I'm not a big fan.  I always try to get Nick DiPaolo.  I always try to get Nick DiPaolo.  I call him and say, hey, man, you know, like, Jane Canofini's doing some interview.  Come on, Brandon.  And then he puts it on.  And so he's like, either forget Paris or Harry Metz-Shoutley.  It's all the horrible things.  And DiPaolo, what the fuck is this?  I hear him talking to him.  What the fuck is this?  Hey, you fucking asshole.  I caught him with the Cheaper by the Dozen the other day with Steve. 
[02:22:00]  Fucking Colin rules.  I've never seen that.  Is it good?  Oh, I've seen that and part two.  You have to see it.  The Cheaper by the Dozen is about the Baker family.  Baker doesn't get it.  And they have a hilarious 30-minute scene of them chasing around the fucking hamster or whatever the goddamn pet was.  A frog.  I'm sorry.  A hysterical 30-minute scene.  Around the kitchen.  And, like, the frog and Steve Martin's flying around.  The whole family's screaming. 
[02:22:30]  It's really unbelievable.  It sounds great.  It's the end.  It's the end of the fucking world.  Of the great European culture, if I may be so.  Well, there is a Cheaper by the Dozen, too, also.  I saw that one, too.  That's with the Murtaugh clan.  They come in.  Eugene, I mean, yeah, Eugene Levy and his family come in.  And he's, like, the guy that did well.  Like, Steve Martin never made that much money.  And Eugene Levy has the big house on there.  And he's like, well, you know, and he's always done better than him.  And then they have this, like, games. 
[02:23:00]  But the son, Eugene Levy's daughter.  I mean, Eugene Levy's son falls in love with Steve Martin's daughter.  And it all works out in the end.  That's cute.  I'm glad it always does.  It says, same big family, even bigger adventure.  Yeah.  Oh, that's.  What's the adventure?  Does Steve Martin's wig blow off out of a crop duster and they have to find it?  Don't laugh.  It was a real nail-biter.  The canoe's almost tipped off.  The nail-biter.  The canoe's almost tipped off. 
[02:23:30]  I really wanted to kill myself during that movie.  But I can't take my eyes off that shit.  Yeah, there's something about just a really horrible movie.  You just got to kind of sit there and enjoy it for what it is.  And my dream is to somehow force Apollo to have to watch them.  Oh, God.  I mean, that was seizure.  I would love so much if he was forced to watch every one of them.  He would have a fucking breakdown.  Which is the worst of the Steve Martin films?  Pink Panther.  I can't picture any of you worse than that.  No, and Pink Panther 1 is the worst because it destroys and really urinates on the great legends, you know? 
[02:24:00]  Right, yeah.  Urinates on the great legends, of course.  But I mean, you know, bringing down the house 1 and 2 can't be fucking denied.  Father of the Bride 2?  Father of the Bride 1 and 2, yeah.  And so many people are like, I like Father of the Bride.  And I'm like, ah!  You know, they like the new one.  You guys made the same movie.  Like ten times with different titles.  Yeah, yeah.  His face in the movie posters is fucking enraging.  It's just the smug white guy face.  He is fucking enraging.  They actually changed that line in raging. 
[02:24:30]  Well, now they've superimposed over it.  She goes, what movie did you say?  Father of the Bride.  Father of the Bride?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You said it's not the Steve Martin one.  And he goes and says and beats her and everybody's just cheering.  It's justified because of the fucking Steve Martin one.  Yeah.  Did you buy the DVD?  Did you buy the DVD?  What was the last fucking good movie he made?  The Jerk.  The Jerk.  Yeah, that was the only one.  There you go.  Now, he made some funny things. 
[02:25:00]  I like The Man with Two Brains.  I like All of Me with Lily Tomlin.  It was very funny.  What about The Planes Trained and All of a Lone?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I forgot about that one.  A real.  Oh, that was a great one.  God for going.  Do you want his favorite movie of all time?  No, I do like his own.  That's a great movie.  John Candy rules.  Go on, hit me.  I'm an easy target.  That fucking horrible perm he had.  What about that lady at the airport?  That little part?  She was fucking great.  Oh, she was fantastic.  Let me check.  Gobble, gobble.  That's my favorite. 
[02:25:30]  She's on the phone.  Oh, Murray, you're a stitch.  Yeah, Steve Martin was great.  He's great when he's playing a prick.  I like when he's playing a prick or a complete retard.  Not the dumb dad.  Oh, I'm fucking so sick of it.  Sergeant Bilko was pretty good.  Was that good?  No.  No, another one they dredged up from the old sitcoms.  I saw some of the Pink Panther 2, and I can't comprehend how that got made. 
[02:26:00]  Like, I can't comprehend how a comedian could look at the final product and go, that's good.  What about Caddyshack 2?  Oh.  How'd that get made?  Could be one of the biggest fall-offs in movie history.  What's that one called with Goldie Hawn?  House Sitter.  House Sitter.  Is that Sinbad?  Oh.  No, it's Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn.  I don't know if Sinbad's in it.  Yeah.  What is that?  Oh, that's a weird one.  So, what about the remake of the Out of Towners?  No, Sinbad's in the other one.  It's House Sitter.  What, what, what, uh, Thomas? 
[02:26:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  What about the remake of the Out of Towners?  They fucking destroyed that one.  You ever see that?  I didn't see the remake.  Yeah, he did.  Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin.  It's fucking abominable, man.  The original was such a good movie.  My Blue Heaven was a great movie.  That was great.  My Blue Heaven?  What?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  I thought that was a great movie.  I don't know.  I laughed.  I don't know.  Welcome and goodbye.  Where are you going?  The Blue, my Blue Heaven was shit.  Listen to me. 
[02:27:00]  Shut up, you.  Hit me with a big iceberg.  I told the story about your fucking big iceberg in Boston, you cocksucker.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking took out his knee, Colin.  I know.  It looked so soft.  It looked so soft.  It looked so soft.  Snow tends to look soft.  Yeah.  Ten degrees.  Yes.  Fucking idiot.  Did you feel bad, Colin?  I literally doubled all the world laughing.  We did laugh for about ten minutes, and I was like, fuck you, you're getting me something 
[02:27:30]  to eat now.  We're in fucking Massachusetts.  We do a gig.  There's like 17 fights outside after the fucking show.  People are just beating the shit.  So I see this one little, only in Plymouth, Mass, which is kind of nice, only there's  like this beautiful town with the snow falling, but everybody's beating the balls of each  other drunk, you know.  And then I see this little waitress come scurrying in, and I was like, hey, I understand there's  a lot of fights out there.  Like, I felt bad.  Like, she was nervous.  She looked like Adrian from Rocky, you know, and she goes, yeah, it was awesome. 
[02:28:00]  Awesome.  What's Bowfinger?  Was that good?  Bowfinger, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, and the little catchphrase on the bottom of  the poster is, the con is on.  Well, Bowfinger, I have to be honest, I didn't hate it that much.  Really?  I don't think that came into a movie theater.  That didn't go into a movie theater.  Yeah, it was kind of interesting.  He's made a lot of movies that no one has seen.  A lot of shite.  In our age group, anyway.  What was good, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels he was funny in?  Yeah.  With Michael Caine. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Good for him.  What about Roxanne?  I like that.  He made a lot of money, too.  Good for him.  Oh, I never saw that one.  Roxanne.  Daryl Hannah.  That's like the serial note.  Yeah, I think he's got big or something, right?  He has made a couple hundred movies, hasn't he?  Son of a bitch.  Quite a bit.  I think we're just jealous.  Fuck him.  Fuck him in his ass.  Leap of faith?  Never heard.  That really ruined everybody's day.  Never heard.  Sorry.  Let's talk about Blue Heaven.  Hey, what are you talking about? 
[02:29:00]  He was like, I can't believe Anthony's not all over that book.  Oh, I know.  Whereas he's playing a fake mob Dago or something.  No, but he's supposed to be real.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  He's like, hey, I'll tell you something.  He's got like Rick Moranis as a little nerdy agent.  Hey, mama mia.  Wait, but he's really supposed to be, that's really the character in the movie?  Yeah.  You call that spaghetti sauce?  Can we see a clip?  But that's what's so funny is that if Bob was from like Kansas and he said that was a good character, I'd understand.  But he's from Staten Island.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I used to know a little more.  Bob, why would you think it was good?  Just explain to me the thought process.  I don't understand.  I thought there was some funny moments in the movie.  Oh, Jesus.  I thought Ken Oba had a good role in it.  What the fuck?  Jesus.  Was he in that?  No.  No.  Oh, here he is.  Hold on.  Oh, you want to hear this first?  We got a little.  I was in a hurry.  I was on my way to church to say a few novenas for Thanksgiving. 
[02:30:00]  Thanksgiving is not a Catholic holiday.  Thanksgiving is very big with the Italians.  Turkey cacciatore.  Sweet potato parmesan.  There is no such thing as Thanksgiving in Italy.  It is an American holiday.  And I've been to Italy.  It's not in...  To Florence, right?  Yes.  Ever been to Sicily by any chance?  No.  Thanksgiving is very big in Sicily.  On account of the large number of Sicilians who went to America and then got thrown back out. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  This is so...  Two cases of liquor in the backseat of that car.  People drink too much.  Those two cases of liquor were reported stolen from Kelly's Liquor on 5th Street earlier today.  You're kidding me.  I accidentally borrowed the wrong car of a guy who stole some liquor earlier today.  The car you stole...  It's unbelievable.  This is obviously like a play.  I did have a drug problem back then.  Oh, okay. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Fucking Steve Martin's wig.  I think it looks good.  It looks like it's being fucking held on with railroad spikes.  I hate you.  Colin doesn't like me to do the Pacino.  You know that.  You're unbelievable.  No, don't do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good wig.  Sure is.  You'd never know it if you didn't have eyes.  Some guy steal your money.  I want to hear thoughts and prayers from my man.  Hey, thoughts and prayers to you.  Thoughts and prayers, a tragedy, I understand.  And now we're going to bring on someone that plays a ukulele. 
[02:31:30]  Nice segue.  Hey, guys.  We've got Rich Voss that's going to join the party line.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Rich.  You're on with Colin Quinn, Bob Levy, and, of course, Jimmy and us.  What do you got?  Well, Colin and his manager's on at the same time.  Yes.  Oh, ho, ho.  Great.  What's Levy?  What firehouse is he plugging?  We plugged it already, boss.  Yeah, they're leaving.  How's your car doing?  Actually, he's moved up to restaurants.  He's doing very, very well.  On Thanksgiving, are you going to eat blue cheese out of a turkey's ass? 
[02:32:00]  I don't know.  If Bonnie comes back on tour, maybe I will.  Oh, fucking that one.  Fucking Colin's loving that one.  Damn.  Jesus, Rich.  That was a goofball.  He walked right into that one.  Yeah.  He walked right into that one fucking choppers first.  He walked into it because his car is at the mechanic.  Why is your car at the mechanic, Rich?  What's wrong with it now?  Oh, really?  Because I'm getting it serviced. 
[02:32:30]  What's the matter with it?  No, I'm not talking about an arrest area.  I'm getting it serviced.  Colin, you like that one?  What are you getting done to it?  I'm getting the oil and, I don't know, a couple things.  You know, it's what happens when you have a nice BMW.  You get a service.  I have a BMW.  I know.  All right.  I own it.  I don't lease it.  I got a warranty.  Of course you own it because you're fucking, it's too old to fucking lease.  Nobody leases.  You're shipping out of business.  Nobody leases. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, what are you guys calling me for?  What was the, why are you bothering me?  We wanted to know what was wrong with your car.  Yeah, we were.  Is that it?  I think there was something a bit harsher about that.  We want to do a tour.  What was it?  Colin, you're, Colin, Colin had a great show last night.  We did a benefit for the blind last night.  Colin, he's doing a lot of observational stuff now.  Yeah, we'll never know that.  I mean, just because of the way I was, he's like, what are you, he was like implying that  I was like a hack.  I wasn't implying it.  I was saying that you stink. 
[02:33:30]  I want to see your calisthenic bit from 1940.  He's doing a calisthenic bit, but he's doing old Jack Alain calisthenic.  Jack who?  Alain.  Who's Jack Alain?  Jack Alain.  Get it up on the wall.  Jack Alain.  Jack Alain.  That was the couple that had that exercise thing.  Jack and Alain.  Yeah, Jack Alain.  Jesus, Rich.  It's Jack Alain, you dunce.  Jack Alain.  Those teeth are really swimming in that primordial. 
[02:34:00]  He's a fucking party line.  I love it.  No, Rich, we want to ask you about Bonnie.  There was a time you thought Jimmy had sex with Bonnie.  Not Bonnie, his ex-wife.  Oh, no, your ex-wife.  I'm sorry.  Your ex-wife.  He had sex with Bonnie.  Okay.  I'll tell you why I know he did.  Whoa.  Whoa.  When we went over to watch, when I was on Dead Sam, we went to a, like, he followed me.  We were going to her apartment building, and he knew where to make a left turn, and he's 
[02:34:30]  never been there.  Whoa.  Johnny Ola.  Hey, Johnny Ola, take me down here.  Yeah, she likes it in the mouth and ass.  Johnny Ola told me.  I never know what left he was talking about.  I just...  And you used to always talk about the tile in his house, too.  Yeah, the kitchen tile.  The fucking Mexican terracotta.  Did you ever find out how your neighbor knew about the tile in your house without being  in there, Rich?  Uh, I don't know.  I guess, you know... 
[02:35:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't want to pass up this Jimmy thing.  Yeah, you know what?  Me neither.  Well, it's just silly.  It's like...  What the fuck is this shit?  There's no...  There's no...  You fucking did that?  I can't believe it.  Why would I?  I would never put my dick where Voss's had been.  Yeah.  Why would he want to follow a middle?  So, no, I didn't...  No, Rich.  I don't know how to comment.  And then what?  There were matches from Dangerfields there or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How did you know that?  Who told you that?  Well, Jimmy did after he told us the whole story.  He said he had to light some candles to make it romantic. 
[02:35:30]  To get your ball smell out of the house.  There was fucking matches from Dangerfields.  And Voss comes in and his wife's wearing it naked and he goes,  Fucking Norton's working Dangerfields?  He asked the next wife,  If you fuck him again, could you give her my tape to give the fucking...  Could you get me in?  It is serious, though.  Do you think it really happened?  Yeah, Rich, you don't believe this anymore, do you?  I don't.  I let it go. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, I can't...  He let it go.  He let it go.  That means he still believes it.  He believes it.  You're a psychopath.  Hey, I don't believe...  I don't think he's a psychopath.  We haven't heard one fucking explanation out of that little pipsqueak.  All right.  There's no explanation.  What happened?  It's almost like...  How did you know where the turn was?  How did the match was going to happen?  I don't...  Why were there Dangerfields matches there?  How do I know why she had Dangerfields matches?  I don't...  Bobby had a great line.  Maybe she was fucking Rodney.  I have no...  I can't answer for her why she had Dangerfields matches there. 
[02:36:30]  And I don't remember what left he's talking about.  It was probably like a fucking...  A left turn only thing.  Or it was like maybe...  Yeah, probably that.  It was a curve in the run.  It wasn't even a turn.  I guarantee it's some blithering idiocy,  which could be explained if I could remember.  Well, it's rich, so we'll just take your word for it.  Just say you fucked through it.  Well...  How did you know to hit the gas?  Fucking asshole.  And all of a sudden, you know, after that night,  and like a week later, she started getting sick,  and they didn't know what it was.  She's fucking...  I fucked Jenny Gump, too. 
[02:37:00]  Simply because her ex-husband was less stupid.  She put blinders in her front window.  Bob, Bob, they leave you.  Comics are talking.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I have a question.  Wait, hold on.  They're coming to talk to me, the BMW people.  The BMW people.  They're coming to talk to you.  They never came.  They never came.  The people from the website are trying to talk to you.  Yeah.  How about next week, like next Wednesday,  right before Thanksgiving, 
[02:37:30]  like a big holiday show  where Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane  bring in their pilot from Lifetime?  Just don't do it when I'm not here.  I have to be here.  Are you here, actually?  He's being sarcastic, Rich.  No, I'm not, actually.  I have to see that.  No, Colin, we're not.  It's the Rich and Bonnie pilot  that is just horrendous  because they weren't able to be themselves.  Mohammed Atta was a funnier pilot  than the Rich and Bonnie one.  Jesus.  Oh, you're not here next Wednesday?  All right, we'll save it then. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  We've got to have Colin come in for that, too, you know.  Yes.  I'll be here next Wednesday.  Colin and Patrice.  Colin, Patrice, Norton,  we'll have Levy get us the coffee and stuff.  It'll be like a bug.  Why would you do that?  We're not here next week.  So let him come in.  Thanksgiving, for fuck's sake.  Hold on.  Hold on my rentals.  I'm getting my rental car now.  Wait, you're just getting an oil chance  and you've got to get a rental car?  Yeah, what's wrong with your car, Rich?  He's such a fucking liar.  He's lying.  He's sitting in Jiffy Lube right now.  He's lying to his fucking huge teeth. 
[02:38:30]  No, I don't want to go in with Patrice again  because last week I was in there with Patrice  and I swear to God,  I was thinking about trying to get words in edgewise.  I was too tired anyway.  But then I just remembered  how many times in a tough crowd I'd be fighting.  I was like, wait a minute, that was my show.  I couldn't control this big fucking behemoth.  He was crying about that a week before.  He goes, I've got to go in fucking bed, Patrice.  I mean him, fucking Norton's out.  Who's that?  Fucking Colin.  Patrice tends to talk a lot.  Yeah, he does monopolize the conversation. 
[02:39:00]  A little bit.  Yeah.  Hey, Rich just hung up.  Boy, I don't blame him.  He probably breathed down his phone.  I wouldn't say that,  God damn, somebody will fuck my wife either.  Yeah, he drooled into it and just shut off.  His tooth hit the off button.  I don't like the fact that Norton never stood up  and said, hey, Rich,  a man to man eye to eye,  I swear to you, I never did.  I did say that.  You're a fucking Maury's lie detector.  No, I said that in 1996.  I'm not going to say it again.  You know how many times I said that to him?  Like, you really think that?  You fucking, like, 
[02:39:30]  I'm not even going to answer that question.  Yeah, it's a sick question.  You're a sick fuck.  You're a sick fuck.  I don't have a shitty enough car in the shop,  but I'm going to answer it.  But that was the beauty of that goddamn scene  in Raging Bull,  was that he never did answer.  That's what I'm just saying.  You're a smart man.  You say everything,  but you want to say the answer.  He's like,  you're sick.  I won't answer you.  You think I would do that?  And he's like,  well, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, it's just a very...  I think we should hook you up  to a fucking Maury Povich lie detector.  I'd be happy to be...  Let's get you on Maury.  I'd love to go with a lie detector.  As long as we find other sections  in case that turns out to be a fizzle 
[02:40:00]  and you didn't fuck her,  and then we can find other horrible things.  No, I may decline to answer certain questions.  Where did Vos go?  I don't know.  He went to get his rented car.  You see, he's such a fucking liar.  A loaner car for an oil change.  An oil change.  When did he ever get a fucking...  Why don't you rent...  You know, get your car,  oil change,  get a fucking rented car  and drive up to the fucking Chinese restaurant  this weekend.  Really.  He's such a fucking liar.  You wait a half hour  and you go...  You just sit there.  Yeah.  Bored for a half hour 
[02:40:30]  and get your fucking car.  Such a...  Yeah, he literally followed me  out of Gotham last night  from a benefit.  A lovely benefit  trashing me  and basically calling me a hack.  It was unbelievable.  Wow.  I was still in shock.  He just followed me outside.  The balls.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny, though.  I think he might be...  The narrative of him.  I think he might be calling back.  I'm not sure.  I think the problem is  that he's so dumb  that when he sees my act,  if he hears like one little buzzword  that reminds him of like hack shit,  you know,  it doesn't matter what you're talking about.  He just hears a word  and he's like,  trashing me.  Well, maybe I really have become a hack. 
[02:41:00]  It's kind of sad.  Rich, you think Colin's a hack?  I think Colin's a genius.  I made a joke.  I think Colin's one of the best comics  in the room right now.  Can you have one ounce  of fucking moral courage  or stick-to-itiveness  and just break his balls  calling me a fucking nice guy routine?  Well, first of all...  You did.  Be honest about one thing.  Last night,  it was very serious  when you started calling me a hack.  It was funny  because you were kind of serious.  I didn't call you a hack.  I said,  I like your new observational type of humor. 
[02:41:30]  That is calling him a hack.  Jesus, Rich.  He called himself a hack.  Colin's reinventing himself.  Oh, my God.  That was a big word for Rich.  Anyone else notice that?  Reinvented.  Reinvented.  I like your new act  with the props.  That's really good.  Well, me and Bob Levy  go on the road  and I'm the observational guy.  Yes.  I go up and go,  hey, guys.  I'm like the clean guy, you know.  Hey, would you ever notice...  I'll tell you this.  I've done a lot of stuff off. 
[02:42:00]  Would you ever notice...  Yeah, I do.  That's what I was saying.  I was saying that last night.  Yeah.  Well, you know,  I mean,  I'm like,  I'm going to get into a sock closet.  I'm like,  hey, this 287 is crazy, folks.  Here's Mr. Bob Levy, Lance.  Right on.  And then Robert Klein  closed the show last night.  Brilliant.  Was he great?  It's just watching somebody  with that much history. 
[02:42:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, Hitler had history, too.  He wasn't funny.  I love Robert Klein.  Yeah?  We saw him at that roast,  and he was a little off that night.  Yeah, it happens, you know.  Oh, my God.  Robert Klein.  Yeah, he was a little off that night.  Yeah, but I mean,  he's going to have his bad nights,  but, you know,  he is a funny guy.  But, boss,  the funniest part is,  boss,  as he starts to get  that shame spiral  that he gets  around anyone,  he's as funny as anyone,  but he starts to get 
[02:43:00]  into that shame spiral.  You hear him stuttering,  like, because he doesn't have  like a small talk conversation  with Robert Klein  because secretly, boss,  you know,  feels like a piece of shit  about himself.  So he ends up being like,  yeah,  and he starts like stuttering,  and he's like bringing up  random shit like nobody  thinks about that Robert Klein  didn't even do.  And Bonnie's just,  the long-suffering Bonnie  is just sitting there  like, oh, Rich.  Oh, the long-suffering Bonnie,  that poor girl.  Yeah.  How's Bonnie, Rich?  She's doing fine, I guess.  Bonnie is hilarious. 
[02:43:30]  Last night, she goes to me,  the great thing about my career  is if I fail,  everyone's going to blame it  on me marrying Rich.  That's true.  She, uh,  they call,  you know,  this bitch,  they called her to do a pilot.  Is this what I'm taking right here?  This big towel?  They call her to do a pilot.  This bitch doesn't even have  to audition for stuff.  They just call her.  Yeah, because she's,  they call non-Semitic good looks, 
[02:44:00]  stupid.  Something you don't have.  Yeah, it looks good.  I'm taking a big Tahoe  out of here right now.  Oh, great.  We heard you the first time  when you said the guy,  is this a big Tahoe?  We all heard you the first time.  We don't care.  You don't have to say it again.  He's so impressed.  He's so impressed  they came with Tahoe.  And he's so stupid  he's probably getting lunch.  I'm a Tahoe belt.  We'll probably have to get him  a booster seat for that thing.  Let us help you in, sir.  Yeah.  This is unbelievable. 
[02:44:30]  They're laughing at the dealership  when you leave.  Like, you know,  this shitty Tahoe.  Yeah.  Boston, in the backseat,  in the backseat,  the baby seat,  we do the joke.  The gas is on E.  They want me to put in money.  They want me to pay five bucks.  It's worth it for a call like that.  They're giving me a rental on E.  Don't complain.  I'm going to bring it back on E.  Yeah, that's what I want to say.  All right.  Figures the J doesn't like E.  He makes Jews look bad. 
[02:45:00]  He really does.  This fucking thing is big, man.  How great would it be  to hear a train horn and a thud?  Hold on.  I can't reach the pedal.  Yeah, I know.  We did that joke already.  Of course, yeah.  Oh, you did?  Can you get the mechanic on the phone  to find out what's wrong  with this oil change?  Yeah.  Can we get your mechanic on the phone?  Can we just talk for a second  about somebody who's more placating?  He's there kissing up  to this goddamn chiseler  that gave him a goddamn empty car.  Chiseler. 
[02:45:30]  He's like, yes, thank you.  I'll bring it back on to you guys.  Just kidding.  I'll put a couple of bucks in.  Happy sales.  Did he really say that?  Basically.  He's craving to his fucking people.  A Tahoe is going to be  a little more than five bucks  to drive around with, Rich.  Yeah, Rich.  I'm going to the outlets  while I'm here.  I'm not going to find out.  Where are you?  Where are you?  Hopefully the electrical ones. 
[02:46:00]  With forks.  Yeah, or just smile.  With the tweezers in your mouth.  That was, uh...  Was that Hampton?  That was the line of the day.  If you guys still did that,  that would be the line of the day.  Why don't you guys bring that back?  If they still did that,  you wouldn't get to choose it either,  so shut the fuck up.  That's the line of the day.  Mind your business.  Where are you, Rich?  Rich, where are you?  I'm in Flemington.  Oh, you're in Jersey.  Okay.  What are you going to do  with the outlets?  What am I going to do  with the outlets?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Be a Jew. 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  Buy stuff.  So what do they have to do  to your car?  How long do you have to  have this rental truck for?  Probably for like  an hour and a half or so.  Oh, they give you one for...  Sneak home and see  who Bonnie's banging today.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  See what kind of matchbook is there.  Stress factory.  What's this?  Hopefully the Cotton Club.  What do you mean  you think he's cute?  You know,  I'm supposed to come in there  tomorrow. 
[02:47:00]  I'm wasting all my humor.  Where?  You are?  Exactly.  Where?  Very good.  That's like taking a cap  full of water  and throwing it out  and saying,  no, there's nothing  to drink for anyone.  Comedy and the cars  on E.  Hey, we should go on a tour.  Four Boys Four,  all of us.  What do you think, guys?  Oh, I like it.  I'm in.  Four Boys Four,  I like that a lot.  Four Boys Four.  What an awful name.  Holy shit, Colin.  God, you picked 
[02:47:30]  the worst name ever.  I would never go see that.  That would be  the creepiest name ever.  Oh, God damn.  Jim Bob, Colin Rich.  I like that.  Should we let Rich go  to the outlets?  Yeah, I really,  phone calls are tough.  I had,  why?  Phone calls are tough.  What are you,  Colin's been killing.  Yeah, he's on a phone.  I've been having a great job.  He was up writing  for this all night. 
[02:48:00]  No, we woke him up, actually.  It was obvious we woke him up.  Look, I'm on a cell.  He's on a line phone.  You all right?  You all right there, Rich?  He hung up.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  He gets so mad.  He doesn't even take a bye  or anything anymore.  He gets nervous himself.  Fuck up.  All right, Colin.  All right, guys.  Come and see us, will you?  Love you, Colin.  I feel it hell well.  Goodbye, Colin.  All right, Colin.  It's a big event.  Bye, everybody.  Bye, Bobby.  We'll call you later, buddy.  All right, guys.  Colin quit everywhere.  Colin.  Bob Levy tomorrow, 
[02:48:30]  Mojo 13.  Wow.  Get your tickets now.  In Wilmington, Delaware.  And for the rest of the fucking dates,  where do they go?  We're at BobLevy.com.  Okay, let's do that.  You've got everything on there.  There's a lot of stuff on there.  Yeah, I know.  We'll start with tomorrow.  Mojo 13 in Wilmington, Delaware.  And what the hell?  The next day.  What is the next day?  Thursday?  Yeah.  Okay, Thursday,  Tailgaters Bar and Grill  in Clifton Heights, PA.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll continue.  Yes, I have to tinkle.  Well, let's go tinkle together.  Well, come on, fella. 
[02:49:00]  O.P. Anthony, Jim Norton,  who's going to be on Jay Leno tomorrow night,  and Bob Levy playing restaurants  all over the fucking place.  And I'll be at primetime next weekend.  And don't forget to listen to us  on Miserable Men every Sunday night,  XM 101, Howard 101, 7 to 11.  We've got a big crowd of everybody,  a little everybody.  Yeah?  That's how you do it. 
[02:49:30]  Nice.  Doing a Sunday night radio show,  which is very cool.  There's a buzz on your show there, Bob.  No, I like it.  No, I mean literally,  when you listen to this.  Yeah, and we're trying to fix it.  Yeah, they don't give you a...  Gotta get an engineer in there.  They're not giving you enough bandwidth.  Jesus.  Broadcasting on real radio.  What was it called?  Real radio?  Real audio?  What the fuck was it?  Oh, my God.  E-yada.  E-yada.  Remember that fucking disaster?  Fuck E-yada.  It's all...  It's new.  It's on that internet thing.  It's called E-yada. 
[02:50:00]  Leave your radio gig and go there.  Great.  Fuck you.  I'm only bringing this up  because the phones  and the instant feedback  all over this one.  People are very confused.  Artie Lang's CD's being promoted  on our fine channel 202,  and I have no problem with that,  by the way, whatsoever.  That's the problem.  But you certainly are never going to hear  anything promoted on Howard 100  or Howard 101,  and we're sick of the double standard.  The double standard.  They see it, you know,  that it's okay for Artie's stuff 
[02:50:30]  to be on our channel.  That's fine,  and we're not even going to argue that point.  But how about Jimmy's stuff?  Put Jimmy's stuff over there, then.  Oh, well, put it down.  Isn't he so funny?  Hiya.  It's amazing to me.  Not only will they not do that for me,  it is amazing to me  the things that they will not do  for me here.  Yeah.  The situation I'm in,  it is not improved.  It's fucking mind-boggling.  I've never been in a situation like this 
[02:51:00]  in my professional 20-year life.  Never!  Sorry.  I thought you were getting a good update.  No.  What?  No.  No.  He looks pissed.  He definitely looks pissed.  Jimmy's pissed, I'm pissed.  But it's not even an update.  You might as well go home now.  It's just, it's here, bitch.  Do you want to take this?  Here, bitch.  Take this, bitch.  That's what it is.  When you come to Mitchell,  men will fucking plug the shit out of you,  you motherfucker.  But it's simple.  If Artie's going to be promoted on our show,  then we want some stuff promoted on Howard's fucking channel. 
[02:51:30]  You know, it's all everything.  Simple as that.  It's starting to take over from normal radio.  Tell the fucking guy to relax.  He makes a really good living.  And then shut up.  Someone tell him to shut up.  So we can all work together as one fucking company.  It's not coming from us.  Trust me.  Bob Levy's in here.  He's a big part of Howard's channel.  Artie's commercial's being played on 202.  It's not our problem.  We're fine with it.  If everyone just played together,  we're here to crush regular radio.  Thank you. 
[02:52:00]  Regular radio should be crushed.  Destroyed.  Thank you.  Exactly.  And everyone's deal should be honored,  and everybody should be treated right,  and that's just the way it should be in any company.  Right.  Good faith, they call it.  Yes, they do.  Good faith.  Yes.  And intent.  We should all get rent-a-cars on you.  Good faith.  It should be just simply equal when it comes to that stuff.  I mean, we understand.  There's only one Messiah.  We understand our place.  Trust me.  Do you do the right thing with the other shit?  Yes, Anthony. 
[02:52:30]  I'm just watching the news,  and do you realize with the Iranian nuclear facilities  and how they keep talking about how they're not going to comply with UN inspections  and things like that, very defiant Israel,  very nervous about the fact of Iran having a nuclear device,  and we've just built a 30,000-pound bunker buster,  put two and two together. 
[02:53:00]  I think we're getting ready.  I foresee.  Even with Obama in office, you think we're getting ready?  That's the biggest fucking problem,  but it's not Obama.  Defense contract.  Right now, it's defense contract.  Sure.  It's the Pentagon.  It's built shit.  I understand that.  They got that in place,  and who knows?  Who knows where that one will end up?  We need a bomb that speaks Farsi.  All right.  But that is a giant bomb.  That thing would look like a nuclear explosion without the radiation. 
[02:53:30]  Really?  It would look.  For real?  I would love to see what that looks like  slamming into an Iranian fucking nuclear power plant.  All right.  I hope we didn't blow up your spot because you're on our show, Bob.  No.  You're taking a big chance.  You know that.  Hey, I mean,  you're taking a real big chance being here.  You know that, right?  I can always go back to dancing.  I mean, what the fuck?  I mean, I'm here to promote my show, Miserable Men.  You've been friends with Jimmy forever. 
[02:54:00]  I know all you guys.  I know fucking Voss for 20 years,  and I know fucking, you know, Florentine.  You know, everybody.  We all started together.  You know what I mean?  It's so weird that we could never sit there.  For the most part,  the two camps get along.  Yeah.  Except for the one fucking guy that makes all the money.  I don't know what goes on.  But all I know is that,  it's like,  I don't see this guy in 20 fucking years because,  you know,  it's the weirdest thing.  Like, we talk in the hearing habit.  I'm like,  how much fun would it be to sit next to him like this, 
[02:54:30]  you know?  Yeah, we gotta go down every day.  Yeah, but not every day.  It's not fun every day.  Hey, don't go fucking crazy.  Bob got me a lot of my work because Bob,  Bob likes to tip a few back.  Uh-huh.  Um, and by few,  I mean we have to fucking drag him out of every gig by his ankles.  Well, I'm holding on to a waitress.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  He starts off in grade.  It's like Weekend at Bernie's,  just pulling him dead to the fucking heart.  And Florentine holding me around.  Yeah, he's still alive.  And it's funny,  I wrote a chapter on my first book about Levy,  about a benefit we did. 
[02:55:00]  And he goes to me,  this is just typical Bob.  He goes,  oh, dude,  the chapter is really funny.  Somebody read it to me.  Yeah, yeah, guys.  I can't.  I was in the car.  Plus, I can't read anyway.  Somebody read it.  But I was dying laughing.  I go,  the way you explained how I handled money,  it was the funniest thing.  I forget what it was,  but I fucking laughed so hard because that's me.  When you get a divorce,  you don't realize that you're paying for your lawyer,  and you're paying for her,  and she gets the better lawyer than you,  which is amazing.  Really?  Yes.  That's exactly what happened.  In Jersey. 
[02:55:30]  No way.  Why did she get a better lawyer?  I know.  Because I paid for it.  They go in there and get them.  Why didn't you get the good lawyer?  Because I didn't have the money.  You can't afford it.  That's why I had to do the fucking benefit.  I'm like,  Norton,  help me.  She had the better lawyer.  This lady goes,  I will rip you a new asshole.  My fucking lawyer's going,  look,  we're going to win this case.  And he goes,  also,  I do landscaping,  and here's my card.  I'm telling you,  that's how fucking,  I had to pay for her.  So there's not enough money left over  to get yourself a good lawyer.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Because you have to pay for her lawyer. 
[02:56:00]  And then,  the child support thing,  it's like,  you know,  they go higher.  And then you're like,  I want to pay this.  And she goes,  she's not comfortable.  She's not comfortable with it.  I got a fucking child.  You're feeding a fucking baby  with a fly on its head  for 40 cents a day,  and I'm paying $12.50 a month.  That's a lot of money for one kid.  What is my kid doing?  Is he jet skiing yet?  That's a little fuck.  I mean,  isn't that a lot of money  for one fucking kid,  $1200?  I was giving her $4,000 a month  because she wasn't working. 
[02:56:30]  I didn't want her to lose the house.  Being a nice guy.  Then I go to court,  and they're jamming up  my fucking ass again.  That's how it works.  That's why life sucks.  I'm telling you.  There's got to be hell.  We're living in hell right now.  You don't have to tell me  about that part.  You see,  you've been through  the same fucking thing.  You go to court,  and they just don't give a fuck.  I don't know how much  I want to say,  but it's a no fact  he didn't have any kids  or own a house.  What is that?  An aunt's marriage  is only legal in Massachusetts. 
[02:57:00]  At the bookie lounge,  I heard.  They got married.  They got married.  Yes.  And how did you get screwed then?  How did this happen?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, it just,  it took forever.  The divorce took forever.  Okay.  And she wound up getting  Dominic Barbara  as her attorney.  I wound up getting  the landscaper guy.  You got Jack O'Lane.  Yeah, yeah.  Jack O'Lane.  And, you know,  it just,  I would have liked for it  to have worked out better  on my behalf. 
[02:57:30]  Exactly.  I gave the house away.  I actually lived  in that basement  for four years  only because I wanted  to be my son.  Yeah.  And I paid all the bills.  Then you figure,  you know,  when I crawled  out of the bunker  like in Hogan's Heroes,  you know what I mean?  I'm in the basement  with my little radio  and that shit.  And she would say,  okay, I'm going to  give you a break.  Not at all.  All of a sudden,  women can't work.  Yeah.  Once they fucking,  a baby falls out  of their cunt,  they're useless.  They're the most useless  people in the world.  And now I got to fucking, 
[02:58:00]  I got to pay for it  because you're used  to a lifestyle.  I was used to,  that was my lifestyle,  you fucking cunt.  And now,  now look at me.  I'm a fucking mess.  Yeah, how come you,  what about the lifestyle  you and you still?  Oh, they don't give us that.  You know what I mean?  And you think I can,  you think I can get  a fucking rent-a-car  like Voss and go around  with my big teeth?  I never understood that.  You're absolutely right.  Wow, that's a great point  we never brought up on the show.  They have to have money  so they can continue  living the lifestyle  they've become accustomed to.  That you gave them.  That you gave them.  And it costs you  the lifestyle 
[02:58:30]  you've been accustomed to.  Yeah, now look at me.  I fucking,  she's like,  you want to order Chinese food?  I'm like,  I don't know.  I don't have the money,  you know?  I need Norton  to throw some fucking shit  in his double bag  from the fucking  Howie Wowie's  doing this week.  Bring me back  some chink food.  But I mean,  it's amazing.  These women,  they don't care.  One,  they talk to their friends  and once their friends  get going,  I'll take them for everything.  I gave it a fucking house.  That was my pool.  Now some fucking other dude  swimming in that fucking pool. 
[02:59:00]  You know what I mean?  Pissing at my pool  that I paid for.  Worse than that, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  And fucking shooting  his load all over  the fucking house  that used to be mine  and his fucking  cum all over the place  that ain't mine  in my house  that I gave away.  Why?  Because she got  a better lawyer  with my money.  The lifestyle.  She's a good lawyer.  Yeah, why?  You can't have it.  She's got a,  she had a,  she heard I banged.  Oh, now he's up.  He's standing.  All right, go ahead.  She heard I banged  a girl with one arm,  right?  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  So, she went out  and bought a BMW.  All right, I was like,  all right.  You got a stick shift,  I hope,  for the one arm girl.  No, not that one.  She didn't.  She didn't.  I didn't even know.  Wait, she got mad at you  and so she,  it came out on the radio  that I banged a girl  with one arm  because I didn't know  for four times.  I banged her four times  without knowing  that's how much  of a drunk I was.  She had a rubber arm  and I didn't know,  you know what I mean?  I was like,  holy shit,  she's flexible.  Does she work in media?  No, she works in,  no,  she lives in,  in upstate New York.  Okay.  Okay, 
[03:00:00]  but I didn't know  because she always  kept that rubber arm  to that side of me  so I didn't know  and she would only  take her shirt off  halfway  and you would just  start banging it anyway.  You don't give a fuck  if the shirt's still on  a little bit.  Very familiar.  Yeah, so all of a sudden  now that comes on the radio.  I'm getting screamed at  by the one-armed girl.  My wife's screaming  and the audience's like,  how do you put up  with this shit?  You know what I mean?  Then I come home,  brand new BMW.  Then I get a blowjob  from Tabitha Stevens,  right?  The porn girl?  Yeah.  Smart, how was it?  That's what she does  for a living. 
[03:00:30]  How do you think it was,  Smart?  You go to a mechanic,  they fix your car.  I thought it was  a little girl  from Bewitched.  That's how creepy I am.  It was 20 years ago.  I didn't think it was,  Dorn.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, it's a fucking  porn star, you dick.  They don't know  how to suck your dick.  But now, then she hears that.  So then, now she has  a Mercedes truck.  So what do you do?  You just go in the house,  you know what I mean?  Because it comes out.  What are you going to argue?  You know, that I was going  to turn down a blowjob  from, you know,  from a fucking porn star.  So this is what happens. 
[03:01:00]  They keep buying  with your credit.  You know what I mean?  Because your credit  is on their credit thing, too.  Oh, yeah.  Until you get it off.  You get fucked so bad.  I almost got another loan  on the house.  Because my numbers  were still there.  And I would have got screwed  if I didn't find out.  They are evil.  They should be put  on an island.  And it should be blown up.  Every fucking divorced,  fucking lazy woman  that doesn't want to work,  that just wants to sit home  and get fucking fat  and not do shit 
[03:01:30]  and live that lifestyle,  fucking lifestyle.  They're accustomed to it.  Go fucking back.  They're accustomed to it.  Let them live  their own lifestyle.  And then they call  the cops on you,  you fucking restraining orders  for no reason.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  No reason.  Because I said  I ain't paying $4,000 anymore.  Next thing you know,  I'm on the phone.  I go, hold on.  I think I'm getting arrested.  I'm talking to my friend.  Oh, shit.  And they go,  you have a restraining order  on you now.  We have to fingerprint you.  So they brought me down  because I didn't want 
[03:02:00]  to pay $4,000.  And I said,  why don't you come  and clean my house  and we'll take some of that  off the bill.  You've got to work it off.  Did you make any threats?  No, I just said,  why don't you come  and work for me?  You can clean the house.  You can do this.  You can't say anything.  No, no.  You can't say anything.  That's why everything's  got to go through the lawyer.  Oh, you've got to type  the email.  I can't even spell.  Never talk directly  to the person.  I'm writing Korean  back to this bitch.  You don't mean your heist.  Exactly.  I talk like,  I type like, 
[03:02:30]  boss talks.  So that's what happened.  And you're totally fucked  and it doesn't go away.  It doesn't go away  until he's 18.  And don't live  with the person  while you're split up  waiting for this house  to be sold  or something like that.  It was.  Because my brother,  my brother was going  through some shit  and it turned out  the chick that he was with,  married to,  took a frying pan,  walked right up to him,  smiled,  and smashed herself  in the face with her.  In the face, of course.  And then just bleeding  and called the cops.  They're evil.  And there was Joe, 
[03:03:00]  hands behind the back,  getting arrested  because, hey, domestic,  the cops are called.  As long as they hear  a woman is in trouble,  they can fucking do anything.  They can beat you the fuck up.  You know,  as far as getting that  taken care of,  because a restraining order  and shit like that  is big shit.  That's a big shit.  Especially my brother,  again,  to bring this in.  He is a licensed gun owner.  They immediately take  your license away  when you have  a restraining order  put together.  So,  he had to, 
[03:03:30]  he wound up getting  this neighbor  who was still friendly  with the ex-wife  to wear a recorder  and have her  confess to the fact  that, yes,  she smacked herself  with the frying pan  and went to court  with that.  Is he still friends  with her or no?  No.  No.  No.  Hey,  dear evil,  what was your  wedding song?  I love this bit.  My wedding song?  Yeah.  What did you dance to  the first dance together?  Or songs?  Which one?  The first one,  the first one, 
[03:04:00]  that was married  three times,  so.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I don't like stupid.  I don't like to cook.  I don't like to cook.  The first one was  Warrant.  Heaven?  And they didn't know  the words.  You had that one.  Do you remember that?  No, I wasn't.  That was before I knew you  that one.  I wasn't invited.  He got married to Laurie.  I wasn't.  Okay.  That cunt.  I cheated on her  the second day.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Me and Florentine  are going down  to South Carolina.  I go,  look,  this is the one.  I'm never going to go  with any other women.  Next thing you know,  I'm getting blown  by a stripper  at night at the club. 
[03:04:30]  I'm like,  you know,  you can't,  you know what I mean?  Pussy is something  that's hard to turn down,  but now I'm being  really good.  No,  but now I married  a girl from Cleveland.  They're fucking  very nice.  You know what I mean?  She understands  what I do.  She's small.  You know what I mean?  Oh, she's cute, man.  Yeah, I'm trying to  bang her in the ass,  but she won't let me.  I'm trying to make  deals with her.  Yeah, you work that out.  Yeah, but you can't  work it out  because she's afraid  of my, you know,  and you've seen it.  Yeah, Bob's the large cock.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's a big cocked man. 
[03:05:00]  Nice.  So I told her  I would take  a little strap on  if I could bang her,  and Ella says  it's not gay,  so I agree with him.  So I'm trying  to make her  just deal with her,  but she's not going for it,  which is bullshit,  because you want the ass, right?  I mean,  you work hard for that.  Does she drink?  No, she don't drink.  Oh, that's the problem  right there.  It's impossible.  She don't drink,  she don't take pills.  How am I going to pull them?  Alcohol and ass sex,  it's, you know,  synonymous.  It's like ham and eggs.  It is.  Yes, exactly.  You just, you can't,  there's no ass sex  without booze.  No. 
[03:05:30]  A girl would look at you  going,  what the fuck,  are you crazy?  It's like Jack and Elaine.  After a few drinks,  it's like,  why didn't you put it  in my ass?  Exactly.  Fuck my ass.  You know,  when they're sober,  you're never going to say  fuck my ass.  They go,  you're a fucking ass.  But there's no fuck my ass.  You know what I mean?  You missed the fucking,  you got an ass play, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, how fucking great is that?  It's good.  I got it once.  It was like,  it was a girl on fucking,  from Kentucky, right?  She had this lube at the show  and she goes,  you're going to fuck me  in the ass tonight.  I was like,  all right.  All right.  Now you're in here, right?  Bring it back to the room. 
[03:06:00]  I fucking banging her  in the fucking ass.  The next day,  I look at the blankets,  it looked like  it was a Chicago brown uniform.  I swear to God.  Oh, you got shit on the bed?  There was shit all over the bed.  I was,  it was just all over it.  I mean,  I was like,  you know what I mean?  You're banging somebody  in the ass.  What the fuck?  Oh, you got to come  on the road with us.  Yeah, I pulled Lincoln Logs  out a few times.  Yeah, it happens.  You know what I mean?  And you got it on you  and you're like,  you're just hitting  the fucking,  you know,  the sheet,  the white sheets there.  The other thing  you throw over, 
[03:06:30]  you know,  to the corner  because you're going  to have to cover that,  you know,  but it's a mess.  The comforter or whatever  it comforts you  after you have shit  on the fucking bed.  God damn it.  So now you're married  for the third time.  And it's going to be forever  because, you know,  I'm tired of this bullshit.  I'm tired of giving away houses.  We're all laughing at you.  No, I'm telling you,  if you meet her,  you'd be like,  that's the one.  You know what I mean?  I think one of you  did meet her one day.  Yeah, you met her  and I think one of you guys  did.  I think I might have met her.  Yeah, you met her  when we were up here one time.  And she's so nice.  She's quiet. 
[03:07:00]  She doesn't fight back.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Like, you're going to argue.  I don't mean fight back  when I'm hitting her.  I'm talking about  she doesn't fight back  when, you know,  you have a little argument  or you just say,  look, I don't want to hit her.  Just leave me the fuck alone.  I just want to be left alone.  She'd be like, okay.  You know, I like to be left alone.  She likes to read.  So I make her go  in another room to do that.  And it's a good life.  Bob walks in every time.  What are you doing?  What is that thing?  Yeah.  Where are you living now?  You don't have the house  and the pool and all that.  I live in Deptford, New Jersey now. 
[03:07:30]  I just bought a new house  and things are going great.  We just canceled our big tour  and I'll probably be broke  by December.  So I'll probably take on  a little loan  on that house soon.  Oh, shit.  Nah, we're going to make it true.  You know what I mean?  We're going to make it.  That shit, you know what I mean?  I'm a fucking fighter now  and I'm going to fucking win.  It's Team Levy  and that's the way it's going to be.  Colin knows  I'm a brilliant businessman  but I have to run it myself.  You know what I mean?  Is he good at business, Jimmy? 
[03:08:00]  I, in 20 years,  have not seen  one iota of evidence  that he's a good businessman.  Okay.  But I will say this.  Why don't you prove  you're a good businessman?  Bob is a great,  a funny, funny fuck.  Like, he's wanted to work  with me before  and honestly,  it's like,  you can't go on after him.  I won't go on,  you can't.  You're just going to,  you're going to eat your balls  after fucking Lee.  He destroys.  Let's have fun together.  You'll have fun  and I'll be bombing.  You're not going to bomb, 
[03:08:30]  you fucking,  you see how depressed you are,  you cocksucker?  That won't be fun.  It's not going to be fun.  Let's have fun.  Me, you, Colin,  we can't bring both of them.  Paint each other up.  Yeah, we'll paint each other up,  play alone around with each other.  Come on.  Say, Bill.  We'll take a jacuzzi,  talk about the road.  Come on,  what the fuck?  I got to leave.  No.  I have to,  I got a plane to catch.  Oh, shit.  Where are you going?  Got a plane to catch.  He's got to be on Leno tomorrow night.  See?  Good.  He's got a plane to catch.  Busy, busy boy.  Go ahead.  All right, Jimmy,  safe trip. 
[03:09:00]  Say hi to Jay.  Yes.  Oh, you call him Jay.  Yeah, you know.  See if he'll mention your book.  That was that?  See if he'll mention your book.  I'm going to,  that's the plug.  Half full of marmalade?  Are you?  Levy,  are you still fighting?  What was your last fight?  I can't keep track of your fights anymore.  I went to Ellis Mania.  Who did you fight for that?  I fought one of his guys.  I obviously won the fight.  No more celebrities?  Nah.  I mean,  I won't do it for money  because they're all fixed and fake  and they set it up  and they lied to you and that shit.  Bye, Jimmy. 
[03:09:30]  But that fight,  I definitely won.  If you look at it on Ellis Mania,  I took like three.  You know how to box?  I can get by.  I like doing it  because I'm a fucking maniac.  I just like to hit somebody once in a while.  What else have you fought?  I fought,  I was supposed to fight Bobbitt,  but they said he had high blood pleasure.  Now I'm talking like voice.  High blood pleasure.  High blood pleasure.  His thing was very high.  Pressure to meet you.  They wouldn't let him fight,  so I beat that guy  that they put in there  and of course, 
[03:10:00]  they robbed me out of money there.  The Danny fight,  they robbed me out of money.  So I'm like,  fuck this shit, man.  I sold out that arena  with Danny and that bullshit.  Nobody was there to see him  and they tell me to go light  on the first round.  He comes out whacking me  and I'm like,  this is bullshit.  You know what I mean?  You set me up,  you motherfuckers.  And I would only do it for fun.  Like Jason's a good man,  I trust Jason  and I do it for nothing.  I just do it for fun  because it's good to hit somebody  once in a while.  Yeah, but what about getting hit?  I love it too. 
[03:10:30]  Like me and Jason.  You're a mad man.  No, it's good to get hit once in a while.  Why?  You need to get fucking  whacked in the face once in a while.  Especially in a ring.  In a boxing ring,  it's good.  I don't want to start fighting.  What about getting hit in the ribs and shit?  Nothing.  It doesn't even hurt.  Get the fuck out of here.  The belly would hurt.  That's going to hurt.  No, so you got the head gear on.  I'd rather get hit in the head  and the nose.  The face is like,  I can't take the thought  of your head being jarred back like that.  Yeah, but that's what you got.  You try to stay away from that 
[03:11:00]  and you try to land the bigger shot.  But the body shots,  you know,  you're like this  and they kind of glance  and that shit.  I like fucking.  Well, that's true.  I do too,  but sometimes I got to wear a helmet  because I'm fucking a retarded chick  who one of us have a helmet on.  But you know what I mean?  It's all in fun.  It's entertainment.  Like Jason loves to do that shit.  I like to do that shit.  Oh yeah, well Jason's insane too.  He's insane and like me  and that's why we get along  because we're fucking nuts  and we enjoy a little bit of pain  and a little bit of punishment.  All right.  That's something. 
[03:11:30]  Wow.  I've never been a fighter, man.  I've been one of those guys  my whole life  that just...  You're a lover, man.  I will go to great lengths  to avoid fighting.  No, but in the ring,  it's good.  Because I don't like getting hit  and anytime I've been in fights,  I try my darndest,  but I just get punched in the head.  It never fails.  I made my first,  like a little brawl  with Boomer Esiason  when I was in.  Boomer Esiason?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, this goes way back, though.  That's a little mismatch,  but it was back in elementary school. 
[03:12:00]  That's a great story.  It was Nicelet.  And I punched him square  in the forehead.  Yeah.  The first punch,  I hit him square in the forehead  and broke both bones  in my forearm.  Oh my God.  Yeah, the ulna and radius  just cracked them.  So the rest of the fight,  now I'm fighting Boomer Esiason  with a broken arm.  So I'm virtually fighting  with one hand  tied behind my back  and got just my ass handed to me.  And I've never been good  at fist fighting,  which is, you know, 
[03:12:30]  hence the firearms.  It's hard to land  when a bullet's flying at you.  But the boxing is different  because you try to go  with the skills of it.  It's a whole different thing.  Yeah, it's not just like streetball.  And streetball is easy  compared to boxing.  Put it that way.  Dude, Kenny's training me now.  It's over very fast.  Yeah, and it's fun.  You know what I mean?  You're learning a lot, you know?  Kenny's training me  and he's a fucking nightmare.  Big Kenny?  Yes, because he doesn't know  how to like kind of hit soft.  No, he's like a retarded Brad Garrett. 
[03:13:00]  You're taking these sledgehammers.  I'm like, Kenny, Jesus Christ.  I killed the rabbit.  I killed the rabbit.  That's how it is.  Yeah, you're going to be  laying there with a broken neck.  G.H.  Well, we're sparring  and he's got the mitts up,  you know, you know the deal.  And I'm punching pretty good.  Yeah.  But he pushes forward  because he can't help himself.  I'm like, Kenny,  I'm going to break my fucking hands.  He's supposed to just move it  so you can always make the thing.  No, he moves forward.  So now the impact is way worse.  It's double.  Yeah, but you want that in the fight.  You don't want that.  You know, you just want to hear  and move it around 
[03:13:30]  so you can get the eye cut.  Not at you.  Yeah, but not at you.  I mean, that's doubling  the fucking thing.  He's going to break your wrist.  I brought Kenny to...  There's Kenny all happy now.  I brought...  Look at him smiling.  I brought Kenny to my gym.  He's a fucking animal.  You can see that.  You know what Kenny is?  It's scary.  Kenny is the definition of a mook.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He does.  He looks like Brad Garrett  with Down syndrome.  I'm not going back to his gym, though.  No?  Why?  Why?  Because they got  homosexual locker attendants. 
[03:14:00]  How do you know that?  Did he blow you?  No, but I was scared.  I got a towel to clean it up with.  You just show the guy  your wiener  and then he leaves you alone.  If you're not doing the sucking.  He's going,  oh, first time here?  Did he really say that?  Yeah, and then he gave me  a locker right across  from, like, the attendance desk.  Oh, no, he likes you.  You're his new buddy.  He wants to see that hog.  Dude, you just show the wiener.  Get it over with  and then they move on.  There's nothing to show.  I got to take, like, a doorbell. 
[03:14:30]  Really?  Maybe he's trying to open it.  No one pound.  Yeah, he will go.  Kenny gets mad  because the boxing kind of area,  it's not even that great  of a facility,  is on, like, the fifth floor.  So we're going upstairs  and he's like,  ah, he's all out of breath.  I'm like, oh, it's a gym.  What the fuck?  It's a little cardio.  Relax.  He makes me walk up  five flights of stairs.  It was an elevator,  but I figured if it's a gym,  let's get a little cardio in.  You want to do some cardio  to warm up?  I'm like, what was that?  That was cardio. 
[03:15:00]  You got to go on a treadmill  for, like, 10 to 15 minutes  if you're going to box  for a while.  You know what I mean?  You got to put up the speeds  and everything,  slow it down.  You got to go like that  because that's how  a fight's going to go.  And, you know,  you don't move the gloves up.  You try to kill,  you try to break his fucking arms.  He does good.  He does good.  I do all right.  Yeah.  Nothing special.  But it's fun.  I mean, isn't it fun  to fucking hit something?  You need to get  that fucking anger out.  That's why I do this.  I wouldn't mind,  like I said,  hitting is good.  Getting hit,  not so much. 
[03:15:30]  My favorite fight recently  was with a cabbie  through the little  fucking square hole.  That's like having  his fucking helmets on.  It's horrible.  Well, we were trying  to get at each other  through that little,  what is it,  like it's a 10 by 10 inch hole  and we're trying  to throw jabs  at each other  because after my wife leaves  and she almost gets  dragged off by the guy  because he decides  he has to pull up  and she goes flying.  Oh my God,  now it's on.  So now we're jabbing  through the square hole  and then I'm like,  and this is what  I didn't expect.  He jumps out of the cab  and now we're like 
[03:16:00]  squaring off.  I'm like,  oh fuck.  I don't know  how good this guy is.  And then all of a sudden,  I swear,  it was like a scene  out of a movie.  Another cab comes by  and goes,  is everything all right here?  You know how you've seen  that scene a million times  in the movies?  Yeah, yeah.  And the cabbie looks at me  like you're lucky  and I'm like,  no, you're lucky  and then he jumped in  and took off all pissed off  because now the cabbie  had his fucking,  you know,  his number and all that.  Ah, screw him.  Unbelievable.  But it was weird.  He slowly drove by  this other cabbie.  Everything all right over there?  No, it's not all right.  We're like squared  with our fists up 
[03:16:30]  trying to figure out  who's going to  make the first move.  Now I feel silly  asking for a receipt.  There you go.  I want to listen  to that shitty radio.  You want to do that?  Do we have time for that?  Yeah, let's do it.  Can we take a quick break  so you can leak?  Like a one?  Yeah, we could do that.  A one-er?  It's probably a good idea.  We're going to continue  with Bob Levy.  We're going to get Sam in here.  We do a bit,  it's called Jocktober,  where we look at shitty radio  and it's so good.  We do it for the whole month  of October.  We're like,  it's too good.  We've got to continue  doing this bit.  So every once in a while  we just bring a show  to our attention 
[03:17:00]  and shit all over.  There's enough out there.  So it's called Shit Radio  and Sam found a really good one.  So if you...  Shit Radio.  If you want to sit in  for this,  I'll be great.  All right, Bob Levy.  Tomorrow, Mojo 13  in Wilmington, Delaware  and Thursday,  Tailgaters Bar and Grill  in Clifton Heights, PA.  And for the rest of the dates,  where?  RevBobLevy.com.  Everything's up for November  and then I'll be playing Santa  for December.  And listen to Bob's show  on one of Howard's channels.  Yeah, 101. 
[03:17:30]  So it's nice  from 7 to 11.  7 to 11.  See, I'm a company guy.  You are.  I can promote other shit.  Visible men, baby.  You're the man.  There you go.  We'll continue.  All right, let's get into this.  We loved Jacktober so much  that we're kind of bringing it back  here and there.  Don't worry.  Not every day,  but maybe once every two,  three weeks.  Right?  Yeah.  It's just too much gold  out there on the airwaves.  We need a real good name 
[03:18:00]  for this feature.  Yeah.  There is too much gold.  Sorry, I interrupted you.  No, no, it's fine.  It's just a bevy  of entertaining radio out there  and we ought to showcase it.  Should we just call it  shit radio?  I like shit radio.  Why get fancy with the name  when we could just call it  shit radio  from around the country?  An episode of shit radio.  Yeah.  What is this bit of shit?  Well, Sam is saying  this is worse than  anything we did.  better.  Better as  better meaning worse?  That is a bold statement. 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  Because we had  some pretty good  bad stuff.  Yeah.  Of everything we played  during Jocktober,  this is my favorite.  Wow.  This is better than  anything we played  in Jocktober?  I prefer this  to anything we played  during Jocktober.  He prefers this.  Okay, so it's more shitty.  Well, Anthony,  it's our old station  once again.  You know how they  I love listening.  How they didn't want  to continue with us  even though we were  doing quite well.  We did our jobs.  Kevin from Connecticut 
[03:19:00]  says radiocrity.  Radiocrity?  If we weren't going  for something dirty,  filthy, and to the point,  radiocrity is pretty funny.  But this is worse  than mediocre.  Radiocrity.  Radiocrity.  Yeah, shit radio.  It's got to be  shit radio.  I like the name,  Kevin.  I like it,  but it's just not  it's not shitty enough.  No, it's shit.  And Voss won't be able  to say it.  Radiocrity.  Radiocrity.  Never forget.  Shut up. 
[03:19:30]  That's what he said.  Oh, no.  Never forget, people.  And without a drug  or drink for 23 years  or a thought.  Look how Bob is shocked.  We hang out with him.  I know.  It's just so funny.  We have the same story.  It's like me going,  I saved a baby.  Just say,  goodnight, people.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Goodnight.  I saved a baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, shit radio, sure.  It's our old station.  Yeah.  You know,  they're doing nothing  after we left,  which is amazing.  I thought they had  some kind of plan.  Where now? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, this is now.  Our old station.  Oh, well, I thought...  92.3 now.  Oh, okay.  Because it's happening now.  Now.  Now.  It's going out of business now.  Now.  It sucks now.  Should I just play  the first track  without explaining?  I could alert  what's a little bit  of what's going on.  And this is kind of  a serious thing  that somebody  broke in  to the 92.3 now  promotions office.  No.  Wow, did they? 
[03:20:30]  To get the new  Aerosmith song?  Yeah.  No, they had,  as most radio stations do,  $10,000 in cash.  Oh, yeah.  In the office.  They always keep it  in the office.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  With a bunch of cash  laying around?  Yeah.  These radio stations  aren't normally  just filled with scales  and fucking low-lives  and dregs of society.  How about this?  They couldn't afford  to keep us on,  but they have $10,000  cash laying around.  They're like,  please listen to us.  We couldn't get  bumper stickers, 
[03:21:00]  we couldn't get T-shirts,  but they got Ted Large  just sitting in a drawer  somewhere.  That someone could  just steal.  Yeah.  Well, uh-oh.  They decided to  mention this on the air,  Tic Tac and the Freak Show.  Of course.  The afternoon show.  I think I work with Tac  at one of these diners  I'm doing up.  I'm sure.  Good old Tac.  So Tic Tac  brought it up.  Why would they mention  that there was this money  laying around?  I guess,  no, no, no,  it's not there anymore.  It's not lying around anymore.  That's what they brought up.  Did the money get stolen? 
[03:21:30]  Somebody broke in  and stole it.  Wow.  All $10,000  and the jocks  are not happy.  I want to see  how they handle this  because, uh...  Why are they doing  like 1950s radio?  It was like 1950s.  I would call that person  the winner.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  Exactly.  All right, well,  Tic Tac breaks the news.  Someone stole $10,000  from the now FM prize room.  Listen to this, Ant.  This is shit radio.  All right, 92.3.  Now, it's Tic Tac. 
[03:22:00]  Sorry.  This has been...  Oh, my God.  Right off the bat.  The acting shots.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I'm...  I'm...  Wrong kind, wrong kind.  I just hung up the phone.  You're not...  Oh, you're not gonna  believe this one.  He's flabbergasted.  He's flabbergasted  through the echo-y  fucking sound  that they put on the mic.  I had to go to rent the car.  But...  But he made sure  he played the proper  amount of music  before he broke  the big news, right?  He said, like,  break it into  whatever fucking record 
[03:22:30]  was playing.  I'd be like,  they took the fucking money.  Right.  It's more important  to play the music.  Right.  What do you do this  at 7...  Oh, it's afternoons,  3.20?  Oh, this is so good.  I would bet  this was 5.20.  This is a 5.20 break set.  Is it?  I believe this is actually  three on the dot.  That's not smart.  Well, they gotta start it,  maybe.  Maybe it continues a while.  All right.  All right.  This has been  a crazy day.  We got the Bieber thing  going on. 
[03:23:00]  With the Bieber thing, too?  This happened?  Holy shit.  And he remembered  to hit the bed music, too.  Because he would get  in trouble  if he doesn't  talk over a bed.  I think if Ken Townsend  was missing,  I think the PD would go,  you know what,  it's okay you didn't  talk over the bed.  Yeah, just make an announcement.  Right.  Maybe the Bieber ate it?  Yeah, yeah.  What happened with the Bieber?  Wow, this is...  We can't get through  two seconds.  A crazy day.  We got the Bieber thing  going on,  and then our vice president 
[03:23:30]  of marketing,  Jody,  walks in.  She's crying.  She's in tears.  You've just joined us.  Somebody actually stole...  Not our Jody.  I don't know.  And I'm sorry  that this knowledge  got out,  but this is what happened.  Somebody stole  a $10,000 cash...  How did...  How is he sorry  the knowledge got out  if he's saying it  on the air?  I'm sorry  this knowledge got out,  but now I'm going to  say it over the airwaves.  So,  over 50,000 watts of air,  so another 2,000 people know. 
[03:24:00]  No one's listening.  Dude,  this is so  hack,  bad,  fucking,  typical  radio.  But they thought  this is going to be huge.  When we announced  this with the beaver  and the missing money.  They must have had  talking about this  and spelling it out  and saying how,  look,  you really got to  play this up now,  guys.  Don't,  you know,  don't skip.  We'll bring Jody  in crying later. 
[03:24:30]  She'll come in crying.  So she's going to be crying.  I'm going to act  like flabbergasted.  Jody's not on the air.  Oh,  thank God.  Whichever Jody is.  I don't know.  You remember Jody.  Do I?  Oh,  please remember her  at least.  She was really  in my wake.  I don't remember.  I look over the bow,  not the fucking stern.  I fucking don't care  what I'm leaving  in my prop wash.  Poor Jody  was left there  to deal with this shit.  Yeah.  But this is what  happened.  Somebody stole 
[03:25:00]  $10,000 cash  in broad daylight  from our radio station.  $10,000.  And so now we're looking,  but yeah,  what?  You have to take this call.  What line?  Five.  Somebody wants to talk?  All right,  hello.  Hello.  Taro,  who the hell  did you just...  They're going to take a call  out of all this  fucking madness?  This tent was a big robbery.  Hold on.  We got a call.  Holy shit.  Somebody's calling out. 
[03:25:30]  Pick up.  Pick up.  There's one caller.  We got to get him on.  Someone's requesting a song.  The new Miley Cyrus song.  We got a call.  Yeah,  it's a radio station.  We got a call.  Are they talking?  You're probably getting,  well,  a dozen an hour.  Yeah.  Come rolling it.  This is so bad.  This could be the worst ever.  Wait a minute.  I'm getting,  Sean the producer  is saying they did this exact bit  on 104.1 in Hartford. 
[03:26:00]  This is probably...  Oh shit,  it's one of those fucking bits.  This is a bit that an agency  puts out  and they come with a consultant  and they sit with the staff  and tell them how to work it.  Unless there's a burglar  that's going from station to station  stealing all their money.  I think it's a serial money stealer  criminal guy.  I think that's a little more realistic.  You don't think he wants to be  the 10 call to this guy,  do you?  He's just going to fucking  take all the money.  Hacks!  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I love this.  I love how bad this is. 
[03:26:30]  I love hating shit like this.  All right,  let's listen.  The acting is terrible.  It's really bad.  Listen to the phone call thing.  Louie Baines on the phone.  So now we're looking,  but yeah.  What?  What?  We have to take this call.  What line?  Five.  Five.  Can we listen to Todd?  All right,  hello.  Hello.  Who the hell did you just put through?  Who is it?  Who the hell did you just put through?  Now he's getting angry.  No,  who the hell did you put through?  Mr. Fabasham,  are you on the phone? 
[03:27:00]  That was either Beaver or Rich Voss.  Mr. Fabasham,  you'll bring back that money.  Bring back that money.  So bad.  You know it wasn't the fifth caller.  It was the first caller.  $10,000  and my string of palopanese.  Well,  Tic Tac talks to the mysterious caller.  Now this mysterious caller,  does this in any way  fit in with the money missing?  Well,  I mean,  you see,  it's very suspicious.  He's using a voice modulator.  Is there some kind of weird voice thing going on?  Could it be? 
[03:27:30]  Oh my God.  The criminal calling in?  Stop.  And he has throat cancer?  I have your money.  Oh.  I know a radio guy that stole a half billion.  But, uh...  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh,  I don't know who you're talking about.  Is he going to give that away?  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  We're just talking about  Now FM.  Oh,  sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry,  I couldn't help myself.  92.3.  Now.  Now.  Yeah,  let's talk about Now.  Now.  I'm sorry.  Tic Tac.  I was only joking. 
[03:28:00]  Now,  Tic Tac.  Yeah,  let's go to Tic Tac.  Talking to the mysterious caller.  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  talk to me.  Is this,  is this Tic Tac?  Yes,  this is Tic Tac.  Who's this?  This is your new friend.  Are you having a bad day?  A little trouble at the radio station?  I don't know who the hell this is,  but I don't really have time to talk to you right now.  I have time.  I have...  Why doesn't he have time to talk to him right now?  Because it's stuff going on.  See,  this is the thing.  Tic Tac is...  You can't put two and two together and realize, 
[03:28:30]  wait a minute.  $10,000 is missing,  and this really strange call just came in.  Tic Tac and the freak show.  Yeah,  maybe you should take the call and figure out if that's something to do with it.  But the reason he doesn't have time to talk right now is because something big is happening.  None of it makes sense.  This is so bad.  Tic Tac and the freak show,  they like to have fun on their show and get a little wild.  I see.  I see.  Okay,  well,  I'm just saying that sometimes it gets a little too serious,  though,  when you start talking about stealing $10,000.  Who the hell is this? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Time.  I have lots of time.  I have 10,000 units of time.  What?  Who designed the security system at your radio station?  Are you the one that took the $10,000?  Well,  fuck is such a vague term,  but I do have it.  You took the $10,000?  $10,000.  Yeah.  That's what you're saying.  He said it three times.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  That's what that thing is saying.  I am no Olivier by any sense of the imagination,  but this motherfucker is so utterly bad.  So you're telling me.  Look,  I don't have time for this.  I know of a radio duo that gave away a hundred grand once.  Well,  yeah,  I do too.  See how I just saved our asses?  Sort of.  All right,  let's get back to this. 
[03:30:00]  This is so bad.  The 90,  the 923 now fugitive explains to Tic Tac what he wants.  His demands are very,  ready for this,  Ant,  radio friendly.  Thank God for this station,  right?  So it's nothing about,  you know,  somebody's life is in danger or,  well,  believe it or not,  some of his demands could actually increase like TSO.  Oh,  wow.  I spent listening.  All right.  That could be great.  Let's see what his demands are.  And I know.  And how the jock,  you know,  takes the demand. 
[03:30:30]  Yes.  And I know of a fat fuck radio host that once gave away a toy Yoda.  Hey,  toy Yoda.  Toy Yoda.  And it was a little Yoda doll,  Star Wars action figure.  We're giving away a toy Yoda.  And he had to say it that way too.  Toy Yoda.  Toy Yoda.  Why are you saying Toyota so funny?  No,  not Toyota.  A toy Yoda.  You're going to get me screwed,  dude.  What was the other one?  There's another one.  God damn.  It'll come to him.  All right, 
[03:31:00]  listen to this.  Tic Tac.  Do you understand the moment you walked out of this door with the $10,000 that you stole out of the safe,  you became a criminal,  a fugitive.  Whoa.  Hey,  idiot.  Shut up.  I think you got it.  I'm the fugitive.  I'm the 92.3.  Now,  $10,000 fugitive.  It's got a name.  Wouldn't you name yourself?  If you stole from a radio station, 
[03:31:30]  wouldn't you name yourself after the radio station?  Then I'd call back and let him know.  Yeah.  Holy moly.  I'd be deep in dead hookers right now.  Oh,  my God.  Please.  I'm the 92.3.  Now,  $10,000 fugitive.  But Anthony,  do you know that when you left that building,  you became a criminal?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Aren't radio guys supposed to be cool?  Like,  you'd be like,  ah,  whatever.  Yeah,  we're good.  Spend it in good health,  you motherfucker.  It ain't my money. 
[03:32:00]  Send me half,  please.  Yeah,  and why is the DJ fucking pissed off?  It's not his money.  It's not his money.  And the,  oh,  is this bad?  The fugitive speaks slowly so that even though he's got a voice modulator,  the important branding messages like his name are clear for everybody.  All right,  let's listen.  Could you repeat that for me,  please?  You're a fugitive.  No,  I'm the 92.3.  Now,  $10,000 fugitive. 
[03:32:30]  The 92.3.  Now,  $10,000 fugitive.  Now,  bring back the money.  Now.  No,  no,  no.  Here's what we're going to do.  We're going to play a little game.  Tomorrow morning,  at 10 a.m.,  I'm going to call Lisa.  And I'll tell her a little bit about myself.  You don't understand.  This is New York.  We will catch you by 10 a.m.  Well,  he's from New York,  not Detroit,  so he knows.  Hi,  hi,  hi,  hi.  He's a New Yorker. 
[03:33:00]  He's a New Yorker.  He's a New Yorker.  I am speechless.  I have never,  in all my years,  and believe me,  we heard Rocco's show,  heard anything so blatantly fake and stupid,  embarrassing,  on the radio.  brah-bombing,  brah-bombing better than this.  I know a radio duo.  This could be the worst fucking radio bit I've ever heard.  When we were being hacked,  we were doing small market shit. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  New York City's supposed to be the big time for radio.  So if you guys had stayed at 92.3 now,  you wouldn't have played along with this.  What do you think, Sam?  What do you think?  What do you think that meeting would have been like?  What do you think?  What do you think?  Give me the answer, Sam.  I thought you guys were more like company guys.  Oh, yeah,  good.  Okay,  so the fugitive calls in when?  Let me give you a little example,  if that was the fact,  and we still were doing it.  Hi,  I'm the 92.3 now,  $10,000 fugitive.  Good job.  Oh, are you?  Greg,  we got shit to do, 
[03:34:00]  so just fucking,  you know,  do what you want to do.  Yeah,  bring the money back tomorrow.  By the way,  our promotions staff sucks.  They came up with this lame idea.  We're giving away $10,000.  No,  I'm in the clique.  Shut up.  He just hangs up on them.  That's how it would go.  Sounds like we've worked together for a while.  Well,  fuck it,  at WNW,  they want to do the,  what was it called,  the revolution of rock?  No,  the,  what the fuck was the big song? 
[03:34:30]  The evolution of the rock of New York.  The evolution of the rock in New York,  but they bring us in  because they're going to blow up the place  and we want to just do our talk shit.  It's like a big retrospective  of all the years  that they've been at the rock station.  All the other jocks  were really into it  because they were music guys  and me and Ann  every afternoon  just beat the shit out of the fact  that we had to do this.  We refused to play certain songs  because they're too faggy.  We were,  we were breaking CDs  and this was all real.  None of this fucking fake acting shit.  We were out of our minds.  Getting in fights. 
[03:35:00]  We were calling it.  Telling the cleaning lady  that she has to push the next button  because we're not playing  Do You Think I'm Sexy?  We're not playing Rob Stewart.  We're calling it  the air pollution  of the rock of New York.  It was just  that fucking bad.  It was amazing.  So yeah,  like Ann said,  we would never play along  with this shit,  ever.  This is the  Serious XM  202  AIDS Spreader.  I'm going to  fuck women  on the street  and give them AIDS  unless you can make  $10,000. 
[03:35:30]  This is more like it.  Stay on the line.  Boy,  I would hate  for some kind of character  to call the  Ron and Fez show today  with some demands.  That would really,  really suck.  That would really,  really suck.  Are they off today?  I know Cheech and Chong  are around here.  I think Ronnie's talking  to Cheech and Chong.  Oh, they're doing the  But that was early.  Oh, okay.  So they might be doing the show?  Yeah, that was good.  They are go-getters.  All right, here we go.  The Fugitive is also  planning on calling  at 1, 3, and 6 
[03:36:00]  Monday through Friday.  Not just 10 a.m.  Oh, is he?  He's going to call  at set times?  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't the police  be monitoring those calls?  That he's saying  exactly when he's calling in?  And then I'll call back  at 1 o'clock.  And then I'll call back  at 3 o'clock.  And then I'll call back  at 6 o'clock.  And then I'll have  a nice weekend.  And on Monday,  I'll do it again.  Repeat after me.  10,  1,  3,  6. 
[03:36:30]  Maybe that's the clue  right there.  Who knows?  I could be anybody.  I could be that weird guy  in the cubicle next to you.  Toro, trace his number.  Trace the number, Toro.  Trace the number.  I can see that guy  on the subway  who always reads  the foreign magazines.  But that's for you  to find out.  Are there tracing?  Is there tracing equipment  at the studio?  I don't remember us  being able to trace 
[03:37:00]  a phone call.  We had an old,  old phone system.  I guess you could dial  star 6-9.  Yeah, I don't think  it's tracing.  We actually had  one of those  old fucking phone things.  And you hit the button.  Yeah, all that shit.  Yeah, when we were  at the station,  there was no tracing.  And they also did  this promotion  in Rhode Island as well.  All the radio stations  are coming forward.  Sounds like a cat burglar.  Yeah.  I think FM's  making a comeback.  I'm getting out there.  Die, fuckers.  Put regular radio 
[03:37:30]  right back  where it belongs.  Shitter.  Then I guess what?  They move on  to the next jock?  Well, he said  he was going to call in  at 10 o'clock  the next morning.  So Lisa Page,  who we all know  from her great Jay-Z interview,  she's doing her show  and all of a sudden...  Make him believe  there's nothing going on.  Now, didn't they know  at 10 o'clock  this guy was calling?  He said it enough times.  Well, luckily,  she tells her audience  about the incident  with the $10,000.  and right as that happens, 
[03:38:00]  she gets the mysterious  phone call.  She was upset, too, right?  She was very upset.  New York's new 92-3-0.  Lisa, the music.  Okay, so...  Yesterday...  $10,000  was stolen  from our marketing department.  And, um...  We're good acting.  We have no idea  who did it,  but it happened  in broad daylight,  and the money  was supposed to be used  for the Yankees Day  parade today.  It was $10,000. 
[03:38:30]  It was all that was left  in our...  The Yankees Day parade?  Which, you guys...  Are you fucking kidding me?  They couldn't come up  with a better reason?  A better reason  for the $10,000?  What were they gonna  spend $10,000 on?  Well, that's never  put out there.  Maybe a float?  The Yankees Day parade...  What are they talking about?  They put $10,000  out for anything.  They have absolutely  no creativity.  92-3.  Nobody listened to us float.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, I don't even know  who the PD is  these days over there,  but imagine that guy  is just, like,  giving them a pep talk.  Yeah.  Oh, it's going great, man. 
[03:39:00]  This is good.  We got people.  They're gonna be listening.  And then, keep in mind...  Critiquing their acting.  How long ago  was the Yankee parade?  Fuck, dude.  I don't know.  Two weeks ago?  It was after I drank  my dad's cum  from the tweeted thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I was tweeting.  I was a little angry.  That was when the promotion  started.  So, since the Yankee parade,  the fugitives  have been calling in  Monday through Friday.  Enough with the fugitives. 
[03:39:30]  That's 10, 1, 3, and 6.  And 6.  I'll give him  fucking promotion today.  I don't care.  Let's all listen  and see if we can  figure out who he is.  Hey, Parade,  it was $10,000.  It was all that was  left in our budget.  So, we don't know,  like, how it happened,  who did it,  how they got even  access to the building.  I don't know,  but what?  What was on the line?  Hello?  Hello, Lisa.  It's nice to meet you.  Yo, who is this?  Well, if you're listening,  there's only one person 
[03:40:00]  it can be,  you dumb twat.  Wouldn't the police  be there waiting  for the 10 o'clock call,  first of all?  Yeah, we've all seen  the old school movies.  Oh, they hung up  too quickly.  Keep them on  in another two seconds.  Keep them on,  keep them on,  keep them on.  They make that stretch thing,  like, keep it going,  keep it going.  And then she just  doesn't know the voice.  She didn't hear  the fucking  tick and tack show.  What do you mean,  who's this?  The thing is,  she started talking  about the $10,000  as a coincidence  at 10 o'clock. 
[03:40:30]  She didn't realize  she was going to be  getting a call  just as she started  that talk.  So maybe that's why  she was confused, right?  Yeah, because it was  all spontaneous.  Oh, who is this?  You dumb cuss.  Don't you realize  the voice,  what did everyone  call like this  to request  one of these stupid  techno pop shit songs?  It's the 92.3  now $10,000  fugitive.  The last bull fuck  didn't come up 
[03:41:00]  with a cooler name.  Black the guy.  The guy that stole  the money.  The guy that stole  the money guy.  They had to settle  on that name.  What are you talking  about?  They had a long  drawn out fucking name.  Nobody's calling in.  I said,  it's one guy  but two days.  Can everyone,  alright,  here's a homework assignment.  I want everyone  out there to buy  a bullhorn  and start calling  this station  around the clock  as other fugitives.  It's 5.30,  you can't be the fugitive. 
[03:41:30]  I am, yeah.  Yo, who is this?  Well,  if you were listening  to that old  who was on  after you  yesterday,  then I think  you know who I am.  I'm your new  BFF.  Her new BFF.  Yes, yes,  and of course  I'm sure it's  the 92.  We know,  we know.  God.  You can hit a wrecking ball  going through that  building right now.  It's fucking over. 
[03:42:00]  It's fucking over.  Done.  Well,  Anthony,  good news.  The fugitive  lets Lisa know  what he's doing  with the money.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh,  I can't wait  for her acting.  You know,  she's going to be like,  you can't do that.  Yo,  what's the deal?  I did hear a little bit  of this yesterday.  So,  you have,  you have $10,000  of our money  that we were supposed  to use towards  the Yankees  big parade  promotion  that we were doing.  That's all we had left 
[03:42:30]  and you,  yeah,  well,  here's the deal.  They haven't spent  $10,000 on that.  That's what's hysterical.  They don't have the money.  I love taking the people  inside this shit.  We were there,  what,  two years?  They might have spent  $100 on this.  For real.  For real.  I think they bought  us breakfast once  and went,  hope you're not too hungry  because this is all  we can afford.  Oh,  how embarrassing.  Oh my God.  I love this.  I am embarrassed  for this fucking station.  And why?  Embarrassed.  Somebody stole their $10,000. 
[03:43:00]  All right,  Sam.  Sam,  you're an asshole.  We get it.  You're an asshole.  Oh,  let's hear this.  That's all we had left  and you,  yes,  well,  here's the deal.  I introduced myself  last night  and I'm going to talk  to the people  at the radio station  as long as I stay  consistent  and you don't  screw around with me.  I'll call back  every day,  Monday through Friday  at 10,  1,  3,  and 6  and I'll give you  just a tiny bit  of information  about myself. 
[03:43:30]  Here's the ground rules  as much as they are.  You have to ask me  if you want me  to give you  the money back.  You have to ask me  exactly the right way  and the right way is  are you the 92-3  now  $10,000 fugitive?  I'm confused.  Hold on,  let me write that down.  Where are you?  I have to say,  are you  the what?  I don't know.  I'm the fugitive  and ask the exact phrase 
[03:44:00]  are you the 92-3  now $10,000 fugitive?  The thing is  you gotta keep listening  because every time  he calls in  he gives a clue  as to who he might be.  Who he is.  And then you have to  find him on the street.  Dude.  What?  You have to find  the guy on the street  and say that.  This is too much work.  But he's a criminal.  Why would I want  the police be a little leery  about civilians  just walking up  to a thief like that?  God,  I hope one of their listeners  walks up to a gang  and gets shot in the foot.  Did you steal the money?  Yes, I did, motherfucker. 
[03:44:30]  Now you're a witness, bitch.  Bam.  Shot in the head.  Sorry about the homicide  that was not due to  92-3 now $10,000 fugitive  and the radio station  was not held responsible.  The lawyers asked me to read this.  We apologize  to the family  of the dead person.  Yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut.  This bit might have worked  in 1979.  Exactly.  This is ancient 
[03:45:00]  past radio.  When you do radio  that you have to keep it  fucking simple  when you're giving shit away.  That's why  just seventh call  you get blank.  Word of the day is blank.  When we tell you to call  just know the word of the day.  I couldn't follow  what they were saying.  This is begging for listeners  for the whole week  or month.  They're just saying please.  If you find this fugitive  on the street  and you ask him properly  and he says yes  then you get to keep  the $10,000 
[03:45:30]  and since he stole it  and then he gave it to you  now it's yours.  Sam,  can we make  Iraq our fugitive?  Yes.  Have you seen  Iraq on the street?  If you ask him wrong  he's going to  ass fuck you.  Are you the 10th  and the right way is  are you the 92-3 now  $10,000 fugitive?  Lisa,  could you repeat that please?  Wait,  so you're telling me  that you just want  random people 
[03:46:00]  to come up to you  and ask  are you the 92-3 now  $10,000 fugitive  and just like that  you're going to  give the money back?  I thought you'd be  the one who would  be trustworthy  and would believe in me.  Holy shit,  this is a lawsuit  way to happen.  Oh my God.  I've got to get  on my knees here.  Yeah.  I hope he's  on disease praying  because I know  how these lawyers are.  Please.  Please.  How do you hope  this plays out?  Oh,  that some  the wrong person  is asking  if they're the fugitive. 
[03:46:30]  Just like we joked  about by the way.  Yeah.  That's all it's going to take.  And they're going to say  who the fuck  are you calling  a fugitive?  I'm going to be  a fucking punch  in the fucking face.  Just because I'm Hispanic  doesn't mean  I'm a motherfucking fugitive.  Oh,  this is a disaster  waiting on.  Oh,  please.  We should just go out  and this is going on  right now.  We should just go  out on the street  right now  and assault someone  and go,  oh fuck,  we thought it was  the future.  I'm trying to get  your money back.  I'm doing good,  right?  We're working with you.  We did good,  right?  We fucking,  he didn't have the money  on him.  We zip stripped 
[03:47:00]  his hands behind  his back,  kicked him a few times,  tuned him up.  He talked.  He said it was him  after we kicked him  in the face a few times.  So,  and I think we have to,  okay,  I think we have to  fast forward  to the next day.  Yeah,  well,  it's like the next  Monday.  The next Monday.  Wow.  Because you're going  to hear Lisa again,  but now this is  after the weekend  or something?  Now that we've  set everything up,  I just threw in  a couple of the  fugitives calls  over the past week  or so.  All right.  Wow,  you've been working  on this one  for a while.  Well,  I mean, 
[03:47:30]  and now we've got  to keep following him.  Oh,  please.  I know where I'll  be at 10,  1,  3,  and 6 p.m.  Dude.  More fugitive shit.  Let's just go outside  and tackle somebody.  That would be so fucking fun.  I thought it was them.  The fugitive's been  messing with Lisa Page.  Yeah.  He thought Lisa Page  was being impolite to him,  and so at one point  he made her go out  on the street  because otherwise  he wouldn't have  given the money back.  Uh-oh.  So she had to stand out  on the sidewalk  with a sign on her 
[03:48:00]  that says,  I heart Barry Manilow.  Wow.  Of all the embarrassing things.  Of course,  luckily the sign  also said,  Why would the fugitive  say I heart  from 92.3  I heart N-words.  You are listening to me.  Now I'm going to  lock your doors  you fucking cunt.  Lock your fucking doors.  I'm going to fuck you.  Oh, wait a minute.  Sorry.  We traced the fugitive 
[03:48:30]  phone call.  It's coming from the studio.  What are the odds  that the fugitive  is Tom Chiasato?  I'm going to bore you  to death with a meeting.  Tom would have  never allowed this to happen.  No, this is so hack.  All right, so  the following Monday  you hear Lisa again  fooling around  with the fugitive.  Yeah.  Hello, Lisa.  Oh, it's you again.  How was your weekend?  Well, it would be better 
[03:49:00]  if we could just  find this freaking money.  Can you just give  the money back?  Why would that  affect her weekend?  What does it matter?  No one would.  Could you?  Why would she have  a bad weekend over this?  Let's picture this.  We at work  at that radio station  someone comes in  and goes  holy shit, dude.  Someone stole  fucking ten grand.  Some idiot left  ten grand  in the fucking  marketing office  and someone stole  you know what we'd do?  Fucking idiots.  So fired.  Completely fired.  Something getting fired.  Although, 
[03:49:30]  oh, I need help  from an AF listener.  Oh.  What band had  their whole fucking van stolen?  And we actually  all afternoon long  was trying to find their van  and by the end of the show  we...  What happened?  I'm the fucking  1027WAF  band equipment  standard guy.  I'll be calling you  10, 1015,  1030,  1045,  11,  11,  11,  11,  11,  1145,  12,  12,  12,  all right.  And doing a drum solo 
[03:50:00]  out of the 12.  Someone's got to help us out.  The band became  pretty fucking famous  and their van was stolen.  By the end of our show,  swear to God,  they found it  in a horrendous neighborhood  and nothing was left.  And they even called us  like,  I really appreciate the help  but unfortunately,  you know,  it doesn't have a happy ending  but thanks anyway,  guys.  We'll see you next time  we're in town.  I forgot the fucking van.  And there's the picture  of Lisa Page.  Like,  there's no one on the street.  No one gives this shit.  I love Barry Manilow.  There's no one around.  There are less people than on a normal day in New York. 
[03:50:30]  And can I tell you something?  She looks like someone that would probably enjoy a Barry Manilow song.  So what's the big fucking deal?  And thank God the fugitive allowed her to plug her name and station on the humiliating sign.  There's three people on two blocks in New York City.  And this is supposed to be a big thing.  People are like, wow, she's going to be outside.  I've got to see this.  You think a lot of people are asking who the fugitive is?  No, I didn't even hear about this dumb thing. 
[03:51:00]  Are you the 92.3 now fugitive?  Baby Sam.  This is so fucking stupid.  What are they trying to make, like an action movie?  Yeah.  Kind of like, oh, look at it.  He's making them do things.  I want you to stick a big black dildo in your cunt in front of the building.  Go to the adult toy shop and get something called the anal intruder.  No, no.  Put the lube down. 
[03:51:30]  You won't be needing or using that.  Shove it dry up your hiney hole.  Good girl.  Now, we need someone to follow her anal blood trail to the radio station.  We're going over time today, Dan.  I have the boys figure it out.  Sorry to Ron Pez.  But they have a long day anyway.  They got the sheep and chanx.  Oh, my God.  I'm sure Ron would have had a little breaking action.  I can't believe how there's nobody on the street for two blocks. 
[03:52:00]  For a big radio promotion.  Oh, and she really looks like someone that would fucking maybe listen to some Barry.  I mean, he's got hits.  I'm sure she's listened to a few of them.  Who gives a shit?  A dog named Bagel.  Like a longer update.  The fucking fugitive rules.  Get more of this shit.  All right, so let's go back to the audience.  We can just find this freaking money.  Can you just give the money back?  Just give the money back already.  God.  God.  I didn't have asked you that question.  I actually was pretending like I cared. 
[03:52:30]  You're not going to get away with this.  We're going to get you.  Or I'll eventually get bored and go to Atlantic City and go to the Wheel of Fortune slot machine.  That would be fun.  Now, how about if you just shut up and listen?  It's been nine days.  It's been just nine days.  But it does seem like ages.  Don't ask anyone you know who dressed up for Halloween.  I was still contagious.  Ask everyone you know.  Are you the 92th Street?  Now, $10,000. 
[03:53:00]  Did you hear the clue?  What was the clue?  What was the clue?  I thought he said something that he's contagious.  It said, don't ask anyone you know who dressed up for Halloween.  I was still contagious.  So it was someone who was sick at Halloween and didn't dress up.  What?  What?  That's the clue.  But is it someone that works there?  I don't know. 
[03:53:30]  But how would the listeners know that?  They're not at the fucking party.  They would have to give a shit about what they're hearing.  Like, who's going to win?  Someone that works at the station and goes, oh, that's Bill.  He's fucking over there in accounting.  That was just a stupid idea.  Give him the money.  It could be anyone, literally.  How about somebody who works at the gas station or the radio station or a celebrity?  But how would anyone know if the guy at the gas station didn't dress up Halloween and was contagious?  I'd have to ask.  And how about this stupid company that uses the $10,000 to get a jock that just says interesting shit?  Yeah, there you go.  They could hire a morning show.  They could hire a morning show for $10,000. 
[03:54:00]  Motherfucker.  $10,000.  And it was fucking Creed when they were on their way up.  It was Creed.  It was fucking Creed, man.  They were all right to us.  I know a lot of people make fun of that.  What's his name?  Scott.  One of them could be the fugitive.  But they were all right to us back then.  You want to Creed?  It could be.  It was Creed.  It could be.  With the van thing that we were talking about.  All right.  Tic Tac.  Now we're back to Tic Tac.  Oh, shit.  Because remember, he's calling all day long.  So Tic Tac's getting the calls, too.  He's had nine days to work.  His acting chops, too.  So I'm going to want to hear what he sounds like now.  He's got good shit now. 
[03:54:30]  He's probably going to be good now.  I bet.  Listen, you cunt.  Oh, Stephen S. from Basher makes a very good point.  Don't be mean.  All 17 of 92.3 Now's Twitter followers are trying hard to find the fugitive.  92.3 Now, I am Tic Tac, and apparently the fugitive man is on the phone.  Fugitive man?  How do you know I'm not a fugitive Lady Gaga?  I could be anything.  You're being sumptuous.  You know, I don't have a gang, a mob, or a crew. 
[03:55:00]  You might want to ask friends.  Food drink, diet, Mountain Dew, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, tummy, tummy.  Bye-bye, Mr. Tic Tac.  I'll talk to you in three hours.  Has anybody...  With your knife.  That's a good hint.  And the voice effect sucks.  So if you really wanted to try to get into this, you can't even fucking understand.  Just have a normal guy talk on it.  Right.  That picture of her on the street is the saddest thing I've ever seen in radio. 
[03:55:30]  I want to find her and give her a hug.  Yeah.  And say it'll be okay.  Just whisper in her ear and go, look, I know this sucks.  Just show your twat.  Look, they'll give you more money.  Just marry a guy with money and get out of the business.  Just leave this business.  It's going to tear you to pieces.  Look what it's doing to you.  I've seen fucking strippers blow smoke out of their twat and have more dignity than you  do right now with that sign around your neck.  Nobody around.  Nobody.  There's no one there. 
[03:56:00]  But this dumb station is stupid enough to put it on their website.  Somebody could have raped her and nobody would have came to her defense.  We've been in situations where people don't show up.  You just don't show those pictures, you dummies.  Do I have to explain everything?  Do you have a picture on their website where it's just her by herself on a street corner  with no one giving a crap?  And the guy crossing the street on the sign.  That's it.  That's the only other person there.  But you can Photoshop people in there these days.  Help her out.  Yeah.  They have, like, those dumb fucking street teamers.  Make believe they're fucking people in the street. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, walk around.  You guys did, but I feel like you missed his last hint.  I really did.  I think Mountain Dew.  Well, he said.  Drinks Mountain Dew.  He doesn't have a crew, so he doesn't have, like, a group of friends, and he drinks Diet Mountain  Dew.  Diet Mountain Dew.  You know who drinks Diet Soda and doesn't have a lot of friends?  Who?  Iraq.  Oh, you had something who could be.  Ask him.  I will.  I'm going to ask him.  Ask Iraq if he...  Wait, who's the fat...  You've got to say it the right way.  Who's the fat fuck over there?  Chunky.  All right.  It's Chunky.  Oh, it's Chunky.  Chunky's the fugitive. 
[03:57:00]  Is that why I don't...  Does it really take the...  Oh, that's why he calls it six and doesn't call it in the nighttime.  It's Chunky.  Yeah, but that's dinner time.  He wouldn't call it dinner.  Because that's going to be the big reveal that it was an inside job by Chunky.  It was Chunky.  And Chunky sucks.  Does Chunky set it up by maybe saying something like, oh, God, I was so sick for Halloween.  I wanted to go out.  Oh, that's a good question.  I'd do a little research.  Do a little research.  Find out if Chunky...  I will bet...  I will just bet.  Because they'll hold me to it.  But what if someone just walks up to Chunky before the promotion's over? 
[03:57:30]  There's a fat fuck over there.  That probably drinks diet Mountain Dew.  What if someone walks up to Chunky now and asks him?  Then, you know, he's got to go, go away, go away.  We're not ready to do this yet.  Or do you think they usher him in the building, surrounded by people that, like, punch the  listeners away from him?  Hi, are you the...  You two stand back.  Yeah, stand back.  Chunky's coming out.  Sam, I don't care about this, so I'm going to forget about it.  But just, you know, just remind me that I said it was Chunky. 
[03:58:00]  Okay.  When the time comes.  And nobody's going to ask Chunky.  And I don't even...  Nobody knows who Chunky is.  Yeah, they don't know who the fucking guy is.  Like, less people know who Chunky is than know who the fugitive is.  And he's not part of the bit, so it's Chunky.  Can we go do it with a camera right now in front of the studio and just start harassing  people?  It's Chunky.  It's Chunky.  Just tell people, Chunky's the fugitive.  And people go, what?  I don't know what you're talking about.  They don't listen.  Could you guys call our old radio station?  You probably still have the number.  I'm sure they didn't change the numbers.  And just over and over go, it's Chunky. 
[03:58:30]  Everyone knows.  Everyone knows.  This is stupid.  It's Chunky because he's fat.  What's enough?  Do we have any more clues?  And then go, you let Opie and Anthony go for this?  Yeah.  The final one.  Lisa here is from the fugitive.  Oh, back to Lisa.  Really?  Yeah.  She's got to be really mad now.  She had a weekend rune.  Yeah.  It's been like nine fucking days.  She's probably on a period again.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Something tastes like rusty pennies.  Are you on the rack? 
[03:59:00]  Speaking of Chunky, how's your flow this weekend?  Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.  My little Lisa Marie.  You haven't given the money up yet, obviously.  That's why you're calling me again and annoying me.  Yes, but you know what?  I like the ingenuity of your listeners.  They're smarter than you.  It's only a matter of time.  Just give us the money back. 
[03:59:30]  It was never yours to begin with.  Oh, I think we need a new mantra from you.  What do you see, Lisa, when you look out the glass?  I would love to see your ass get caught and arrested right in front of my face.  That's what would make my day.  Well, for me, water is quite near, and it seems to flow fast.  Goodbye, Lisa.  I'll be watching you.  Hello?  What?  What?  You can't even understand what the fuck he's saying between the sound effect and the loud  music.  And the dumb bass line.  What?  He said, water is quite near, and it seems to flow fast. 
[04:00:00]  She's having a period.  Yeah, you're right.  You were right.  You have that.  Yeah, it's a period thing.  Water is quite near, and it seems to flow fast.  They got all the clues on their website, too.  Oh, thank God.  A toilet flows fast.  I'm sure they tell everyone.  We got all our clues on their website.  Chunky probably takes some big shits.  A sinking radio station flows fast.  A sinking ship.  Rats are leaving the sinking ship that is now in there. 
[04:00:30]  If I was a fugitive, even though I work for the station, because it's obviously someone  that works for the station, I would really make it hurt.  Yeah, I would really start making it hurt.  Hi, Lisa.  This is the stick.  All right, look.  It's, uh, I'm a fucking intern.  I've been doing this.  I really have the money, and I'm just leaving town.  Bet over.  It's more than I get paid anyway, so fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck the station.  Fuck the GM.  Fuck everybody.  Get your own fucking coffee, you cunt.  Yeah.  Right.  It's the last cup of coffee I'm getting you.  Fuck you. 
[04:01:00]  I'm leaving.  God damn, is that great.  All right, well, Sam will keep us up to date on the future.  This shit goes on.  I keep following the story.  It still goes on.  Like, the guy that said it the best was, that is 1979 radio.  Actually.  Where people were like, oh, let me get caught up in this whole thing.  Probably even earlier, man.  Like, when the fucking jocks and shit.  When the fucking Cousin Brucie's were happening.  We were saving that for the Pittsburgh Pirate Parade.  Yeah.  But there was literally nobody in this city that's talking about this.  Dude, I swear to you, that's the first time I heard nothing of this. 
[04:01:30]  I heard nothing of the business.  We're going on for weeks.  No.  Weeks.  What?  For real?  It's since the Yankee Parade.  It's since the Yankee Parade.  That's why if we go outside there with cameras and just start tackling people and going,  are you the future?  Look, it's some kind of radio bid.  I'm trying to win money.  I didn't mean to hit that lady.  Just lawsuits stacking up.  It's chunky.  Oh, enough.  It's definitely chunky.  It's chunky.  And then there'll be a whole thing.  I was doing it because I did.  I can't wait to hear the thrilling conclusion. 
[04:02:00]  Look, it's been three weeks, two days.  You ruined two weekends.  And nights, days, and a night.  Just give it back the money.  Come on now.  Like, she would care.  Like, her acting on that last one was ridiculous.  When she got mad.  She didn't say the sentence wasn't, you know.  Stretched right.  Stretching properly.  Yeah.  She was like, we just want you to bring the money back.  She was like, we just want you to bring the money back. 
[04:02:30]  Unbelievable.  What's wrong with us going all the way to 11 o'clock?  Let's go to 12.  Well, you know what the fuck is this?  See how entertaining that was?  What's wrong with us?  Yeah, well.  Ron and Fezzer next.  Bob Levy did a great job today.  Yes, thank you, Bob.  Thank you.  I had a fun time, man.  Let's start with Jimmy.  Jimmy's on Leno tonight.  Let's not forget that.  Not tonight.  Tomorrow.  Sorry, he's flying today.  Jimmy on Leno tomorrow.  And then you got Bob Levy tomorrow at Mojo 13 in Wilmington, Delaware.  Thursday, Tailgaters Bar and Grill in Clifton Heights, PA.  Friday, Orchard's Restaurant in Chambersburg, PA. 
[04:03:00]  And Saturday, East Greenville Company Social Hall in East Greenville, PA.  And you can get all these dates.  At BobLevy.com.  Right on.  We'll see you soon, Bob.  Thank you, brother.  Really good job today.  Thank you, guys.  And Sam will keep us updated.  People are going to just be fucking captivated.  I'm going right out there.  Man, December sucks.  I got to get out there and get 10 grand.  Yeah, you need the 10 grand.  Die!  Who is it? </pre>
