<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous restaurant skit before diving into a Friday dedicated to listener and host experiences with masturbation.  The main topic throughout the show was sexual experiences, encompassing masturbation techniques (using various household items like Nerf footballs, toilet paper rolls, peanut butter jars – specifically avoiding "Chunky" – and beach objects; "nature jack" was also mentioned), and sexual encounters. Callers shared numerous anecdotes, including modifying a Nerf football for masturbation, and experiences with a bed-wetting device that delivered a shock. One caller detailed a prank website selling anti-masturbation devices.  Another caller sought relationship advice regarding his first interracial relationship.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, contributed their own personal experiences, including instances of their mothers walking in on them masturbating. Norton recounted allegedly stealing a neighbor’s underwear and masturbating while visualizing a cousin's discarded clothes.  Bill described masturbating in a movie theater and in front of his sister, while Mike detailed his wife's reaction to catching him masturbating. The conversation also included sexually explicit descriptions and jokes.

The show featured a “WOW” contest, showcasing women's photos, with Lisa (a former *Sopranos* extra) and Wendy June (a model) visiting the studio for a photoshoot with Rick, the show's photographer, who named his poses (“The Britney Spears,” etc.).  Listeners called in with more accounts of sexual experiences, including masturbation with toys and household objects, and Haley described masturbating in a date's bathroom before sex. Damaris discussed her experiences and an online interaction with Jim Norton.  The “FU Line” segment contained angry and vulgar listener voicemails. The hosts briefly mentioned a previous call featuring a woman intensely masturbating while describing a pornographic scene.  Bruce Mittman, a station employee, made a brief, comedic appearance, expressing confusion over the show's content.

The broadcast continued with Opie sharing a story about his father's reaction to visiting his daughter at college.  This transitioned into more discussion of Wendy June's pictures on the website and her bikini car wash promotion. More callers shared embarrassing masturbation stories; Katie’s involved a hairbrush and Dave Matthews music, Kelly's a fish tank filter motor, and Laura's a pager's vibrate function. Larry, a Vietnam veteran, recounted a sexually explicit story involving a friend’s mother.  Further “F U” messages were played, followed by the hosts' reactions to listener calls and photos of female contest participants. Eileen, a caller, angrily criticized the hosts for being out of touch. The hosts responded with insults. The death of John Entwistle of The Who and the band's decision to continue their tour were briefly discussed.  More self-pleasure stories followed, interspersed with sexually explicit jokes.  Pharrell called, recounting a chaotic car sale gone wrong.

A significant portion focused on a follow-up on Scott Farrell’s situation involving a leased car and a "five-foot friend" in Philadelphia, involving the feds and a complicated car return. A rambling anecdote about alien abduction and a radio show on Venus was also included. The “Dice Dice Baby” segment featured repeated chants. The “What Do We Learn?” segment included listener calls with humorous observations about piggyback rides, tickling, bananas, footballs, and a cousin and an "orange sheet."  The “WOW” contest was again promoted, along with risquevideo.com.  The show maintained numerous references to sexual acts, body parts, and crude humor throughout.  The broadcast concluded with a drive-thru restaurant skit featuring a “Greco-Roman size” order.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, welcome to Opie and Anthony Berger. Can I interest you in our number 4 special tonight?  Very great, I need number 4, please supersize, the Greco-Roman size.  Number 4, Greco-Roman size.  Anything to drink with that, sir?  I need a big Coke.  Give me one big Coke.  Okay, sir, anything else?  Give me the curly shoes to go with my curly flies.  Okay, that's number 4, supersize, the Greco-Roman size, a big Coke, and some curly shoes to go with your curly fries. 
[00:00:30]  Sir, if this is correct, please spit into the microphone.  Ah! Poof!  Thank you, please drive up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  More weed every day.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  I'm not gay!  I'm desperate! 
[00:01:00]  I got sort of a kind of point.  Get through your appointments!  Marijuana is the bomb.  You sexy.  Come on.  Yeah, but you got that ass.  Like yesterday, I was having breakfast over there, like, and today I'm having the same kind of breakfast, almost like, like that breakfast happened at that moment. 
[00:01:30]  The way you would have things done back then.  How about a biscuit?  Huh?  Good job, filthy slob.  You got me mad last week.  I think that I don't like it. 
[00:02:00]  Goodbye.  I didn't do enough for you.  What are you people?  Also, this voice blows.  Also?  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like, almost like it was the same day. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, what he said.  Go right to your neck like an animal.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  The Friday version.  Yes, Anthony.  I see the potential for some nice phone calls with those clips, man.  We're working on it.  Totally.  We're working on it.  That's great.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-2774.  Wow.  866-2774. 
[00:03:00]  Wow.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey, mate.  I say 4th of July weekend starts today.  It does.  It really starts today.  Because today is 4th of July weekend.  If next week was the same weekend like I feel today.  We're working a little bit next week.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A lot of people take their vacation next week.  Are you kidding me?  They're already getting out of New York City.  That's what it is, man.  A Friday before you take your vacation, that's not a work day.  That's play day. 
[00:03:30]  You know, when 4th of July falls on a...  Oh, Thursday.  Okay.  Midweek.  Thursday feels like a Saturday.  Yeah.  Midweek, it screws up everything.  It really does.  You know?  Just got to take the other days off.  And if you're a boss, you're going to be a prick and make your people work Friday?  Work that Friday.  The day after July 4th?  Sometimes it works out for the best, though, because a lot of bosses do say, all right,  just take that whole four-day weekend thing, which is nice.  But then the scumbag bosses, you have to party on a Thursday, 4th of July, and then show 
[00:04:00]  up on Friday.  Zero work's getting done, bosses.  We could go with this a little bit today.  Let's talk to the people that have to work the day after the 4th of July.  Ugh.  Bastard bosses.  And you know what it is?  No one does anything on that day.  No one does anything.  It's like, remember in school, the end of the year, those few days where you're supposed  to take tests, but they said, now you're supposed to attend all of your classes. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  When's that test?  Noon?  And if you did, you're just staring out the window.  Right.  You don't do anything.  It's the same thing with work.  You just, you have to come in on a Friday after a holiday.  You're not going to work.  And it's the same when you do a radio show.  Right.  This is like the end of the season, so we're half here today.  We're not working.  No.  Ben actually said he joined me in a cocktail at about 4.  That's not a bad idea.  How about we start at 3.30?  3.30?  Because that way, Ben, by 5.30, he'll just be belligerent and tolerable. 
[00:05:00]  We'll give one good break today, and then we'll start drinking.  That's it.  Know what we should have done?  We should have done the show outside today.  Beautiful day.  Because, you know, these nice days, everyone remembers back to school where you had the cool teacher that would do class outside, at least.  The cool, groovy teacher that would take you outside by the tree.  But there was something about that.  You're still doing the same crap, but you're outside on the lawn.  I never were.  You didn't mind it as much.  See, and some of us went to class.  I still didn't do the work. 
[00:05:30]  Outside, all I would do is then I'd see my class outside as I was smoking my pot by the gymnasium.  It wasn't like I was going anyway.  I don't care.  They could have the class on the moon.  I'm not going.  And it did you well.  Not going to class.  See, kids.  So you don't have to, like, go all the way to 12th grade.  That's ridiculous.  You can be a successful radio personality, even without all that pesky school.  All you need to do is learn how to count to 100, know the alphabet, and know how to speak a little bit.  Did you just say alphabet?  Alphabet.  The alphabets.  Yeah, see, it went with the bit a little bit. 
[00:06:00]  See, kids are just...  Uneducated, so alphabet.  Alphabet.  Whatever.  Just tell your parents, hey, Anthony didn't finish high school.  There you go.  That's your excuse.  And we begin.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, I was looking at this webpage today on the computer.  It's a Catholic church webpage or whatnot, and they sell merchandise. 
[00:06:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Sorry.  Hold on.  So they dumped out.  It's a website that sells anti-pleasuring-yourself equipment.  Anti-pleasuring-yourself equipment.  What's the website?  It's free.freespeech.org.  What?  Slash free.freespeech.org.  Slash shocking truth.  And what kind of stuff do they sell? 
[00:07:00]  They have detection cream for the parents.  They can rub it on for the girl, for the, I don't know, the liquid that would come out  from down there.  They have to rub it on there, and they would find out what it's on.  It says something about rubbing it on the cucumbers to see if it's on there.  They have the Pure Thought Helmet.  And are you on the website?  I can't get to it.  He gave me the wrong thing.  Oh.  Where did it go?  www.what? 
[00:07:30]  It says free.freespeech.org.  Free.freespeech.org.  Dot org.  Slash shocking truth.  Slash or dash?  The horizontal.  Or vertical.  I'm sorry, vertical.  Well, vertical's up and down.  Yeah, there you go.  But the backslash.  Backslash.  It's a backslash.  Okay.  I'm not getting it.  Shocking truth dot. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  No, it's not shocking truth dot.  It's just shocking truth.  Slash.  I'm not getting it.  Oh, my God.  Free.freespeech.org.  Dot org.  Slash shocking truth.  Nope.  Ain't coming up.  You're wrong.  Oh, my God.  You're wrong.  Can I tell you about some of the things that were on this?  And I can clarify this later.  I don't know.  Go back in the show.  Oh, my God.  We have to depend on you? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, I swear to God.  I'll get done.  You were the first guy we went to.  You're the go-to guy to kick off this Friday show.  Let me help you out.  Let me explain some of this.  And I will get back to you.  Do you realize how important the first caller of a radio show is?  It's very important.  But trust me, I won't disappoint.  Tons of laughter involved.  How is there a free dot free speech?  This is the website that I wrote down earlier.  I was on.  You screwed it up. 
[00:09:00]  You wrote it down.  You suck.  We want to play along.  Our listeners want to play along.  You ruined it.  Now we have to take your word for it.  How about this?  Well, let me explain one thing on there.  Oh, no.  Because it's hilarious.  And I told you guys that.  Hey, Cass.  Oh, my God.  It's just freespeech.org.  Did you guys get it?  You got it, Ed?  Yeah, because there's no...  He's such an idiot.  All right, Tom.  We don't need you anymore.  I got it.  We got the website.  Thank you.  What an idiot.  Silly goose.  So is it an anti-self-pleasuring website? 
[00:09:30]  Anti-self-pleasuring equipment.  I'm going to it now.  Anti-self-pleasuring pants made from toughened plastic available in four sizes.  Locks prevent pants from being removed.  This is like real stuff.  Anti-stiffy ring delivers short, violent shock when your junk becomes excited.  Anti-handling device prevents ring from being removed. 
[00:10:00]  Are you kidding me?  This has to be a gag, right?  It has to be a gag.  It has to be at one of those goof websites, no?  It has to be.  A female chastity belt.  Well, how does that work?  Anti-nocturnal emission blanket delivers electric shock when fibers in blanket become wet.  This cannot be real.  This is a goof.  Come on.  Well, I clicked on that shock thing that goes over your mule.  Yeah.  So I'm waiting for that to come up. 
[00:10:30]  But how does it shock you when you're...  I guess if it detects that you're becoming aroused.  Yeah, but every guy gets...  Well, that'll train you not to.  No, every guy goes through that while you're sleeping.  You know why you're sleeping and it just goes wrink, wrink, wrink, wrink, wrink all night long?  You kind of wake up and you got to push on it a little.  You ever wake up and you just got to go...  You got to go like...  And push on it?  You ever get one when you're getting a piggyback ride from your grandmother? 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  You know what this thing is?  All right.  All right.  See, they picked the wrong guy.  You know what, Anthony?  They didn't even look at you.  I didn't even acknowledge him.  I'll take my bombing like a man.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I clicked on this device that's supposed to shock your junk when you put it on.  And see, you picked the wrong guy.  It was in plumbing and heating and air conditioning.  This is a tubing fitting.  This is a fitting that... 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  The plastic vinyl piping goes on this side.  I'm with you.  And then you can lock the latch.  I'm with you.  I know that piece, too.  Of course.  You're not doing anything with that.  At least use fittings that you're not going to recognize, you idiot.  The helmet of pure thought.  Vanish lustful thoughts with this deluxe item.  Click on thumbnail image to read more about this item.  Mule juice detection cream. 
[00:12:00]  Apply to hands, underwear, or bedsheets to detect traces of mule juice.  Cream will turn purple if it comes in contact with the mule juice.  And vag detection cream.  Same stuff.  For the women.  Oh, click here to purchase.  Let's see what happens if I want to buy something.  Due to a number of problems we are having setting up online purchasing facilities.  Yeah, this is such a goof website.  Stop.  What an idiot. 
[00:12:30]  He thought it was real.  Chastity belts.  Those are real.  No one has worn a chastity belt since the 1800s.  Since the dark ages.  Since maybe the turn of the century.  Well, the old warriors used to put it on their bitches before they went off to war so the guys wouldn't be banging them while they were off killing people.  So that was like, but that's ancient history.  What a tool that guy was.  He was our go-to guy.  We could start the show over.  You want to do that? 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to go with another one here.  Uh-oh.  I'm going to throw along and see what happens.  Maybe we can get a touchdown here.  Grayson, what's going on?  Hey, hold on a second.  Uh-oh.  Bye-bye.  Grayson.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's the deal?  I'm about to venture into my first black relationship, if you will.  Oh, yeah?  Give me some advice.  What kind of music should I play when I'm about to get it on?  Theme from Cops.  Nah, are you serious? 
[00:13:30]  I'm dead serious.  You're not serious, Grayson.  Well, here's the thing.  No, here's the thing.  Is she black if she has a British accent?  That's a big question.  Yes.  Really?  How old are you?  31.  How old is this girl?  About 28.  And have you been dating already?  No.  Well, we've gone out a couple times.  You know, hit the clubs.  But now you're thinking you're going to get serious with her?  No, it's not serious.  I mean, serious is in the bed.  Oh.  Well, that ain't nothing.  Nah, you're just trying to get on the radio. 
[00:14:00]  Well, no, I'm not.  You guys, I haven't experienced the black love.  I'm afraid I won't be able to match up.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Grayson.  You can tell he's hanging with his buds.  Look, this will get us on the radio today.  Oh, it'll be someone sent me another site.  Americans for Purity.  Winning the war on self-pleasuring.  And this is real, though.  The myths and realities. 
[00:14:30]  Myth.  Self-pleasuring is harmless.  Reality medical science proves that chronic self-pleasuring causes weakness, depression, forgetfulness, and nearsightedness.  Pshh.  Stop.  Myth.  How many times a day do you have to do that to get into that state?  To where you're nearsighted?  Yes.  I've been cross-eyed a few times from it.  So am I.  The real good ones.  There's such a level.  I don't know if chicks feel the same thing with that self-pleasuring, self-abuse, as they call it. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, you said that you don't do that.  Huh?  Oh, I've done plenty in my day, believe me.  But you don't anymore?  I've done plenty.  No, no, Opie.  I've given it up for Lent.  I gave it up for Lent.  Thank God I'm in a position where I F whenever I want.  Before work, after work, during work, if need be.  But I think every guy still does it no matter what they're getting at home. 
[00:15:30]  You know something?  Normally you're right, and that's the way it's been many, many times.  But I swear to God, if I'm feeling a little randy at any given moment, it's just like, you know, throw down on the bed.  Have some action.  I don't know.  When was the last time?  This morning.  No, when was the last time that...  Early time.  No, I don't need that detail.  When was the last time that you did it to yourself?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Years? 
[00:16:00]  It could be.  Could be.  Probably three.  When did I leave my house?  I think I jacked it that day.  Dude, how do you do it in the morning?  I can't...  I can't...  Morning sex?  Ever.  I hate it.  What are you, insane?  Morning sex is the best.  I'm talking like four in the morning.  Oh, before bed.  You know.  Before bed.  Well, yeah.  And also in the morning.  Doing the morning.  Just waking up and having someone is the best.  Feel a hand over there.  Hello. 
[00:16:30]  I can't do it.  What?  A, you're breathing in each other's faces.  I just never liked it.  I swear.  It depends how you do it.  Breathing in the face depends on what you do.  Your face is.  That's right.  Sometimes I'm breathing into the back of my neck.  It takes way to kill her instinct.  Well, God forbid I breathe into the back of yours.  Thank God I said that right.  No, I'm saying, how do you motivate yourself to come to work after that?  After you finish?  Oh, I...  That's what I mean.  No, I agree with you with that. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, it kills everything.  It saps the energy, right?  There are the long-term ones and there are the quickies.  No, if he's at four in the morning, you can still recoup.  Before bed, yes.  But, yeah.  No, there are the ones before work.  A couple hours before showtime.  Yeah.  And you still have your energy.  Like, right before you hop in the shower and...  I'm with...  I'm so with him.  It saps all my energy.  No.  I have no desire to be funny after I do that.  That's the only reason I'm funny.  Well, you've written off having sex before your shows.  Ever.  You told me this.  Ever.  You told me this when I offered.  Yeah.  And I said, no, not before a gig. 
[00:17:30]  Jim's like a prize fighter.  Yeah.  The prize fighters wouldn't have sex.  It takes away your legs.  You can't.  It'll take away your legs.  Yeah.  Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom and dump ice water in.  Oh.  Now, anytime, anywhere.  That's the motto.  That's the cumia motto.  It's just...  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, but everyone...  Morning, night, anytime, anywhere.  I understand, but...  I don't know.  I don't think I'm in the minority when I say that.  Sometimes I just like to, you know...  No, I used to crank it all the time, dude. 
[00:18:00]  But that doesn't mean I'm not getting enough.  I'm getting plenty.  But sometimes I like to...  No, because you start thinking about the jack, and then it's like, why?  I could, like, you know, I could be plowing.  Feels better.  Feels better than a hand, right?  Depends how you do it.  What are you using?  The warmed liver in the microwave?  I'm an expert.  Did I ever tell you that I hollered out a banana peel?  Oh, brother.  Huh?  When I was a kid, this is true, I hollered out a banana peel, and I silver duct taped 
[00:18:30]  the outside, and I filled it with warm water.  How was it?  Awful.  It was like...  Was it?  The water came out, and I was packing two.  Oh.  I was, like, 14.  I had read about it.  I'm like, oh, I'll try this.  You get so innovative as a kid to try to make it feel like the real deal, right?  You do.  And then you realize, I should have just cranked it.  Dude, I don't even know how I was cranking it.  Things go horribly wrong.  Huh?  I don't even know if I was cranking it.  Or maybe 13.  I might have been younger.  I don't remember, but...  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  People have used cantaloupes, and said that's pretty good.  If you drill out a cantaloupe, and then put it in the microwave for just, like, you know, 
[00:19:00]  three seconds...  One of the dudes from Limp Bizkit admitted that time.  Yeah, yeah.  He was in the cantaloupe.  Because that would be pretty good, right?  Nah.  It comes apart.  You're talking a cantaloupe.  Have you ever used anything?  No.  Not that I remember, really.  I don't...  I never really...  I think once a foam rubber football.  You know those little...  Really?  The little Nerf footballs that drill a hole? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Like, I had a knife, and I think I slid it.  Oh, my God.  And figured, let me just bang this.  I was a kid!  You must have got a bad rash.  Dude, I was a kid.  No, it was like very soft foam rubber.  You're a bad dude, man.  Dude, I'm not hollowing out banana peels.  I'm respecting that.  If you can bang a football, you're a man.  It wasn't a football.  It was one of the...  One of the Nerf...  I'm explaining this!  It was a Nerf football.  They're soft Nerf footballs. 
[00:20:00]  The foam rubber ones.  And I took a knife and just slid it, and then loaded it up with, I guess, Vaseline or something.  Did you give it a good angle at least?  Yeah, you know, I had to rework it.  You know, you try it and go, all right.  It's got to, thank God, it's got to be a little deeper.  You know?  You cut in a little more.  There's Anthony.  This should hit the G spot.  When you are a kid, you will do anything.  I've heard of the warmed-up liver.  Or, you know, mom's fur coat.  Or something, you know? 
[00:20:30]  The best I did was, like, the pillow.  The pillow?  I think most guys did the pillow growing up.  That's just a dry thing, though.  No, that's not like you're putting it anywhere.  You're rubbing.  Right, right, right, right.  Nerf ball trumps all.  The Nerf football?  Yeah, that's awful.  You're going to throw it at one cut of your hands?  Go long.  Hey, who put the stick-em on the ball?  His ball was drooling.  Perfect spiral looks like a pinwheel flying through the sky. 
[00:21:00]  Shooting off.  No, it was just something that was in the room.  It was accommodating.  That's sharing a little too much.  When you are a kid, no, it is not.  Because I guarantee you there are people that just abuse things.  When you are a kid and you're horned up, you kind of got to get creative.  You get bored.  First of all, I was cranking it five times a day.  If I had a sick day, I swear to God, I could have 104 fever. 
[00:21:30]  When my mother's like, all right, stay home from school and she's got to go out and stuff.  And I'm home alone.  I'd have a fever jerk.  That's right.  Where you're just like delirious, you're hallucinating, but somehow my hand got down there.  Oh, wonga, wonga, wonga.  You know how crazy guys are in that state growing up?  If you had poison ivy on your hands.  Wouldn't matter.  Right.  It would not matter.  I swear.  If I got five minutes alone at any given moment when I was growing up, I was cranking.  I was cranking. 
[00:22:00]  I swear to God, I was dehydrated from cranking.  To the point where, you know, it would hurt, but you'd still go.  I got one more in me.  I got one more in me.  I didn't care.  I'd go to the tree fort and have the nature jerk.  You always start off strong too, right?  Oh, yeah.  And by the 10th one of the day.  You're like, oh, God, I'm exhausted.  I think all the iron is out of my body.  I need vitamin supplements to regain what I've lost through this.  And at that point, I'll give you a visual. 
[00:22:30]  You're kind of just holding it up.  Pull it so it's thin as a pencil.  Just work it.  You're just aching all over.  You got a lower backache.  It is.  It is.  But, you know, something that was all part of growing up as a guy, you know, and I don't  see me as being any different than any other guy.  Sure, with me, it might have been a Nerf football.  That's right.  But I'm sure there are other things that people use. 
[00:23:00]  You get creative because you're, like I said, you're doing it so much that you kind of would  just get bored.  Wouldn't stop you from doing it.  But it kind of got a little monotonous.  You'd look for something else.  That's why when you got your hands on some Vaseline or something like that.  Oh, my God.  Field day.  I was finishing once.  It was my third time.  I'll never forget this.  Because sometimes you're just doing it because you're bored and you really want to do something.  Like a monkey in a cage.  Yeah.  I'm bored.  I don't even think I had a full run.  And I'm finishing.  I look at the TV.  I had a black and white TV. 
[00:23:30]  And Happy Days was on.  And I'm finishing.  And Tom Bosley is on television.  Oh, God.  Classic.  Couldn't at least get a Joanie shot that was on there.  I was going to forget that awful, like, ugh.  Hey, Fonzie.  Jean, what's going on?  Hi.  Jean's a nurse.  We're backing up a little bit.  The junk shocking thing, you guys use that on kids that wet the bed?  Yeah, they do. 
[00:24:00]  Stop.  I swear.  I swear.  They use that for kids to try to train them not to wet the bed at night.  That's good.  How does it work?  They put, it's a lip device.  It's like a beeper.  And they put it in their underwear in the part where, you know.  Hold on.  Right.  Yeah, just be very careful.  In the front.  You got it.  In the front, right.  You don't have.  And if they wet the bed at night, it shocks it.  It, like, vibrates with a shock.  Get out.  Is it an actual shock or just a really firm vibe?  So, basically, it's a very strong shock.  Not a shock. 
[00:24:30]  A vibration.  Vibration.  It feels like a shock.  So, basically.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the kid will wake up and he'll stop immediately.  Yeah.  He'll stop doing that.  But if something's vibrating there, if I was a kid, I'd figure out a way to do it.  What type of sexual dysfunction does that bring on somebody later in life?  Yeah.  Stupid, barbaric parents.  Bed wetting.  Hey, play for a game of football?  Ah.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  If a kid, if a grown child is wetting the bed, it's a bigger problem than just shoving  something there that's going to vibrate and shock him, you've got to look a little deeper 
[00:25:00]  into what's going on in that kid's life because that just isn't normal.  You just don't do that.  That's antisocial.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless there's a physical problem that they could narrow down.  Maybe he's got some muscular problem where he can't hold it.  But if you're just letting go like that with no physical problem, there's something going  on.  Now, you ever get caught?  Get caught, Jackie?  Let me tell you something.  I did it.  I probably have done it in the hundreds of thousands of times and never once was I caught.  I was very, very discreet, very paranoid of being caught, too. 
[00:25:30]  And I would do it, like I said, if I had five spare minutes.  I'd go into the bathroom like I was going to the bathroom.  I'm done out, get that red flush look off of my face, a little cold water, and back  out in the public.  Everyone knows I've been caught by my chick.  Recently, which is sick.  Three times.  It's up to three times.  Three times she caught you.  Three times. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  One time because the whole couch was shaking while she was asleep next to me.  No, you can't use the arm in the private.  It's amazing.  You can't use the arm.  It's amazing how much stuff you get shaking.  And you're trying to be quiet.  The dresser's moving.  The door's swinging.  I'll give you another visual.  And then you have your arm like, and things are still shaking.  No, you got to just, there's one way where it's just make the okay sign with your hand.  Here's the quiet.  There are other people that might hear a thing. 
[00:26:30]  You got to make the okay with your fingers.  You're just using that.  Thumb and finger.  And all that's moving is, like, your wrist.  That doesn't work.  All that's moving is your wrist.  No way.  Because then you get into it, and then your whole body has to get into it.  That's what I mean.  You can't move anything more than your wrist very slowly.  Yes.  No.  That's impossible.  Learn from the master.  No, that's impossible.  You have great self-control, my friend.  And a great imagination.  Yeah.  You know, you got to have something bright in your head that's, uh... 
[00:27:00]  It's starting to get good.  That little movement is not going to...  But the second the bedside is going, uh, uh, uh, uh, you're like, oh, all right.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Now I got to move around like I was just moving.  You're describing my life.  Well, you got to move around like, oh, oh, I was just moving.  You're describing my life.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  You're so describing what I do.  And then back to it.  But it's a very slow hand.  I can't believe I'm rolling around in my sleep. 
[00:27:30]  Wrist move.  Sometimes you just got to belt it.  When you wake up, you're like, oh, dude.  Oh, punch it.  Ah.  Dude, my mother walked in on me once.  Oh.  The only time I ever got caught with my mother.  Oh, God.  And were you just laid out?  I was, I had a Velvet Touch magazine in one hand and I was really, really doing a good job.  Were you covered in anything?  Nothing.  Oh, God, no.  My tough skins pulled down to my dumb ankles.  Ah.  It was the, no way I could. 
[00:28:00]  What happened?  How awkward.  Awful.  She walked in and she never did, but I think she's kind of like one of those knock walks.  Oh, stupid parents.  Don't do the knock walk.  And as she walked in.  It means nothing.  It was, it was like, it was a perfect view.  And I'm like, oh, I'm getting dressed.  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't.  Yeah, what can I do?  What are you getting dressed?  Knock anymore?  Getting dressed in your own seed?  That's all you're getting dressed in?  It was never, it was never mentioned.  She never mentioned it and I never mentioned it.  Doing calculus. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, why did I say that?  Getting dressed.  I don't know what to say.  Hi, my.  You want to give me a hand?  How awkward was it after the fact?  You know what?  Aw, what did you do now?  You got to see her.  I absolutely closed the door.  I finished.  And I went out a little while later.  You finished?  Yeah.  I don't think it was that awkward.  Hi, Jimmy.  I'll be going to the store for a few minutes.  You'll be alone.  Red.  Yeah.  Hi, Jimmy.  I always thought you were cute. 
[00:29:00]  Slow motion scene of mom opening the door.  I just seen you moving the stairs.  There's Jimmy's mom coming out of the pool with that lovely red one-piece.  I just seen you.  I just seen you.  I just seen you.  I just seen you.  He's got his Captain Hook uniform pulled around his ankles with his hat still on.  Have some pride.  The Captain Hook uniform is part of the job. 
[00:29:30]  Those boys down at IBM expect it.  Have some pride.  He's heaving it out the window.  Oh, the knock walk.  Oh, doesn't anyone effing knock anymore?  The knock walk is useless.  It's a pseudo-courtesy.  If you think your kid might be in there booting up heroin and doing nothing else, perhaps the knock walk is pretty good. 
[00:30:00]  But the fact of the matter is, if the door's closed, yeah, there's probably some jacking going on and you shouldn't just walk in.  Knock walk never makes sense.  No.  Just walk in then.  Even with the example you just gave.  It doesn't give enough time for them to do anything.  No covering up.  Brother Joe.  Joey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know what, Ant?  I think we are pretty twisted.  I mean, just over-sexed, I would have to say, because when you were a kid, like when the testosterone was really pumping, like we're both getting a little bit older now.  When you were a kid, did you ever, like, draw blood and have scabs from doing that? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I did, man.  You're talking about on the outside, right?  Of course.  Yeah, where you just did.  You know something?  I do remember some chafing.  I never used the okie-dokie method.  On certain people.  I never used that.  You never used the O-Tay jerk?  No, no.  I never used that.  I always did.  Thumb and forefinger together.  O-Tay.  It was always the full-on.  Hey, Joe, you remember this Nerf football of Anthony's? 
[00:31:00]  The what?  The Nerf football that he used?  No, that was something like, I just, I found it laying around and just kind of...  Nerf football.  Yeah, you know, and then you just lube stuff up and go to town.  Whatever worked.  Oh, my God.  I didn't care.  Whatever worked.  No, I have, I must say right now I have an absolutely gorgeous girlfriend and I, and still, I mean, yeah, still.  Sorry, man.  You still do it, right?  Of course.  Joe!  All right, Joe.  All right, Joe.  Joe, Joe. 
[00:31:30]  What?  Did you get Pete Townsend's number yet?  I was going to look into that.  Hey, you know, you know who's playing at the Kings Club tonight in Center East?  I don't know, it's just kind of non-sequitur, but that Corey guy.  Look at Joe, all of a sudden saying something I have no idea why he's talking about.  You were doing so well on the jacking.  You were doing so well.  I was almost saying, this can't be my brother calling because he's doing so well.  And then he goes into something that I don't even understand.  Joe, you realize we're syndicated now, right? 
[00:32:00]  And there's 20 some odd cities listening to something you're telling me that I wouldn't even know what you're telling me all over my cell phone.  And meanwhile, this is going out over many cities, Joseph.  Okay.  All right.  Well, now we need to.  Hold on, we need to know.  I've seen the words of Jim Thornton, I stink.  Hold on, now we need to know.  Now, who is he?  Who's Corey?  It's Corey Feldman.  I'm going with a bunch of guys from the tattoo place and the bike place down to the Kings Club in Center East, which is where he's playing.  Corey Feldman, like from Corey Feldman? 
[00:32:30]  From the Goonies.  Oh.  Well.  You know that little place?  I'm sorry, 22 cities.  It's the little place next door to the sushi joint we go to.  Oh, yeah.  Tiny, little asshole of a club.  And he's playing there.  Oh, Joe.  Yeah.  All right, look.  Oh, that's funny.  I got him.  I think we saved the first break.  I think so.  We almost lost it with Joe's call. 
[00:33:00]  And almost lost in the end there.  There's a guy on the MacGyver of pleasure tools.  Make sure he goes nowhere.  MacGyver.  The phones have exploded, so we'll go with this a little bit.  And also a little alert.  Start new contestants up on opiananthony.com.  Yes.  For the wow contest.  You want to play the trainable thing?  Oh, remember this, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  Want to set it up real fast?  Retard training film.  It's like a sex for retards training film that came out in the, I guess, late 60s.  They used to call them trainables. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, they called them trainables.  Which means they weren't too retarded.  You could still train them a little bit.  But they seem pretty goddamn retarded in this movie.  I don't know what level trainable is.  But this clip is a mom.  Is it the one walking in?  On her son.  On her son.  She does the knock walk.  And then she has to explain to the son to make him not feel guilty and whatnot.  In a manner that a retard will understand.  The mother sounds a bit retarded herself.  She sounds like a Stepford wife.  Jimmy, did your mom sound like this?  When she walked in. 
[00:34:00]  This is the...  Jimmy's got a mouthful of honeydew.  No.  My mom didn't say anything.  She actually closed the door.  And she walked out.  Perhaps she should have done this, then.  Did she feel like you were cheating on her?  Oh, my God.  You know...  That is just inappropriate.  You know, I didn't want to get into making it hot talk, but...  This is so inappropriate.  You know, I took a chance there, because we never went that way with Jim.  And he accepted it.  Thank you.  Of course.  I will allow you to make fun of my mother one time today.  Oh, dude. 
[00:34:30]  There's nothing that bugs me more than Jim goes,  Hey, dude.  That's my mother.  I know.  You know, F you and F her.  Talk about whatever you want.  I'll give you one, though.  Make it a good one, though.  I'll make fun of your mom.  One good one sometime during the show.  What kind of dirtbag would make fun of his friend's mother?  You dick.  Here's the audio.  Many people believe that important elements of sex education  are social behavior and responsibilities.  Social acceptability involves being comfortable with one's own sexuality. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it? 
[00:35:30]  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room.  When you're a little bit older,  we'll have to talk more about these feelings  and what causes them  and how we can control these feelings.  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure to knock next time.  Okay?  This manner of response frees the child of guilt 
[00:36:00]  and assures him he is normal.  It opens communication between parent and child  and introduces the concept of responsibility for his behavior.  To be an Anthony show, 1027, WNEW.  Hit it!  How is she not right?  Is she insane?  Will she know?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:36:30]  We've got to go right back to the phone.  They have exploded.  Good word. 
[00:37:00]  Good choice of words for this topic.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, we're talking about taking care of yourself.  Right?  Yeah.  Being a little creative.  As a kid, you know, hormones are raging.  You're just cranking it whenever you can.  Like I said, I know me.  There were sometimes five times a day, man, until it got to hurt.  Where it was hurting, but you just couldn't stop.  Where you had to hold it up yourself.  Right.  Anywhere. 
[00:37:30]  I remember once as a kid, I went out the back door of the house.  Notice I said it that way.  I went out the back door of the house.  It had to be about one in the morning.  Just so I could crank it outside in the dark.  What was the name of your house, Richard?  With the wind blowing.  Shut up.  Nothing better than the nice breeze blowing across your damn bag.  The nature jack.  You never did the nature jack? 
[00:38:00]  Many times.  I love the smell of paint in the morning.  Out in the woods.  Out in the woods.  In the Long Island.  In the tree fort.  In the tree fort.  Facing south.  Almost like Michael Skakel.  Up in that tree, just pounding away.  There were no houses around my tree fort.  No.  Middle of nowhere.  All right, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Phyllis, how you doing?  Hey, man.  Calling himself the MacGyver of taking care of yourself.  And that is absolutely true.  All right, give us some of the things you've done. 
[00:38:30]  Well, to start off, I almost drove off the road when I heard what you said about the  Nerf football because, you know, the booster clubs at the old high school football games  used to give out those footballs so you could buy them.  Sure.  I had one of those, and I did the same exact thing.  I hollowed it out, but I got a little bit more creative.  But I took, I was rummaging through my father's nightstand, and I found an old rubber, and  I used that.  I put that inside to kind of lubricate the foam so it wasn't so rough.  Wow.  And then I also got to the point where I wanted some of that, you know, old 70s mama muff,  so I went to the hairbrush and pulled out all the loose hair from my, and I taped it 
[00:39:00]  on top of the thing so it would look a little bit more realistic.  Get out of here.  I swear to God, dude.  No joke.  That's classic.  That is no joke.  And I also have done the cantaloupe thing.  That worked pretty well.  Yeah.  But the whole banana, I don't know if that would hold together there, Petunia.  It didn't work, though.  I was packing a half, and I felt silly.  Yeah, you never want to feel silly when you're about to do that type of thing.  Silver duct tape on a banana.  There's no way to make that sexy.  But seriously, like, I mean, I used to get so into it, like, I'd rummage through the 
[00:39:30]  house, like, all right, I've done that, now what else can I do, you know?  So I'd rummage around for circular objects, you know, tubular things, like the inside of  the toilet paper roll.  Oh, I would do the same thing, like just looking around the house.  You're alone in the house.  Oh.  And I would go on a scavenger hunt for something to use to Jack.  I tried the toilet paper roll.  The toilet paper roll.  Yeah.  I mean, it was just always something laying around you.  You just got to get creative and say, well, you know, I got five minutes to spare.  Maybe I can find something deep and tubular that I can, you know? 
[00:40:00]  Some kind of, you know, roll.  I tried that though, and I'm like, man, she's slutty.  I was like, man, I'm small.  What the hell is she doing when I'm now with her?  You know, wow, the toilet paper roll was big?  Yeah.  Well, hey, the toilet paper roll was big.  When I was 14, and look, now I have to defend myself.  When I was 13, 14, yeah.  Hell yeah.  But I also had something to say about it.  I had my greatest growth after high school, Anthony.  Now, let me tell you about the toilet paper roll.  Here's what I did with the toilet paper roll, because you can't just use a toilet paper roll. 
[00:40:30]  It's a little rough.  It's a little rough.  Right.  You take a baggie, and you put the toilet paper roll in the baggie.  Then you put some toilet paper around the outside of the baggie, in between the baggie and the toilet paper roll.  Right.  Then you just drip warm water in there.  Now you got yourself a nice little warm place.  I'm impressed.  I never thought of that.  Yeah.  See, we're sharing ideas, MacGyver.  We're on the same level.  All right, Chris.  All right, man.  Take it easy, guys.  Yes, Norton.  You know what else is for it?  You got a girl that used her mouth. 
[00:41:00]  That works.  A little, you know, slim pickings at that age.  And you needed, put it this way, the only girl that would have been available that much was one that you took prisoner and handcuffed to your bed.  Because it was, like I said, five times a day.  Didn't matter.  Seth, what's going on?  Yeah.  One of the better ones to use?  Yeah.  Jar of peanut butter.  You're lying.  No lie.  Don't use Chunky.  Of course don't use Chunky. 
[00:41:30]  You can't hold the Chunky stuck in your mule.  A jar?  You would go to town with a jar of peanut butter.  Don't use Chunky.  See, that's odd, though, because you know what it is?  You don't want anything getting in anywhere.  Yeah.  You didn't want anything getting in anywhere.  One time.  I don't buy that, guys.  One time in the shower, I was using shampoo.  You got to use a conditioner.  Everyone knows that.  I was using the shampoo.  Shampoo gives you the sting afterwards.  And when something gets into some places. 
[00:42:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  The pain.  It made doing it again an hour later really difficult.  Conditioner always.  Never shampoo.  Conditioner.  And never use aloe.  Never use, like, a lotion.  Does it have aloe in it?  No.  It burns.  Aloe burns?  Yes.  Remember that.  Aloe.  We're getting some great and some feedback.  Chris, when I was 13, I used to TF two water balloons.  Junk mail Jerry. 
[00:42:30]  Home with an ear infection and was cranking to Sigourney Weaver's underwear scene in Alien.  Couldn't hear anything and mom walks in.  Worst day of my life.  Dan from Hoboken.  Underwear scene in Alien.  How quick was that?  That scene, like, took two seconds.  He was 13.  That's all the time he needed.  Right.  As long as you can time it right.  We talked about the timing.  Yeah.  You got to time it and know that she's going to reach up at that moment.  The shirt lifts up and you see her arms.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Dan, going back to Anthony and his Nerf football.  Dan from Hoboken.  Was the Nerf football named Richard, Anthony?  No.  It wasn't.  And he also wants to know, or he writes here, Ant was going out with footballs while his mom  was going out with football players.  Ouch.  No, that was...  Strange but true.  Oh, yeah.  She...  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what's a good video to Jack, too?  It's amazing how back then, that innocent stuff would get...  Back then.  Back then.  When Jackin was like now, only back when men were like dinosaurs.  Yeah, I hear.  I hear me. 
[00:43:30]  I was...  Crimson and Clover video by Joan Jett.  Anything that had a good ass shot in it, Pat Benatar's video.  That had a good ass shot.  Yeah, music videos were pretty good, but the thing is, the choppy direction, it never left  it up on the screen for more than two seconds.  Some of them did, though.  If they would have that, it's amazing.  That was enough.  You just did a little dance like you were playing air guitar and you shook your ass.  I was showing you that that's how they were playing air guitar.  Oh, okay.  But you didn't really need to show us.  Yeah.  We already know.  I can't help it.  The little ass shake.  I know.  The awful image in our heads of you dancing with our cute little air guitar in your hand.  A little beauty-breasted man dancing to a song. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Eddie, who's a Dominican.  Eddie, what's up?  Yeah, yeah.  What up, baby?  Yeah, kid.  Hey, man.  Yo, listen.  Back in D.R., by the rivers and stuff, you know, they got the planting trees.  They got like a soft bark.  Yeah.  You make a hole in it and you just...  Right there, you do it.  A tree.  A plant...  Yeah, it's all dirty.  You should know about this.  The planting tree.  It's not a hard tree.  It's kind of soft.  And you put a hole in the tree?  You put a hole in the tree, bro.  And you know where else?  All dirty.  Give us a call.  You know where else? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  By the river, you know, it's like kind of muddy.  Yeah.  All right.  You put some mud on the side.  Wait till it gets a little bit hard.  You mold it and you just lay on the floor.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  All right.  Thanks for bashing apart those stereotypes.  Listen, listen, white boy.  Relax, okay?  Relax yourself.  Yeah.  You know what else, man?  No.  When you...  Hello?  Yeah.  When you freaking land in your bed watching porn or something, I got caught a plenty of 
[00:45:00]  times with my mom.  But you know what I hate?  What?  They come in, they catch your jacket and they try to play it off like they didn't see nothing.  Did that ever happen to you guys?  Well, no.  Never caught.  I got caught once and my mom just walked back out.  Yeah.  She did the same thing.  Yeah, exactly.  They try to play it off like they didn't see nothing.  Well, she's supposed to do.  Boy, you've gotten big.  I'm glad she left.  And one time, one time I was in the shower.  Oh, boy.  You know when you're in the shower after you, you know, you finish and it gets wet, it gets 
[00:45:30]  kind of white and like buggers and you leave it running around?  Yeah.  My father caught me there too.  He came out, I was just finishing the shower, he brought me back in the shower, he was like,  oh, what is that?  His phone is annoying.  Eddie.  What up?  Thank you though, Eddie.  Eddie, I'm going to teach you something.  What?  You should have stuck with your first story.  The tree.  It was strong, it was to the point, it was like you would have left a hero.  I suck.  I stink.  It's not that you suck, but then you had to follow it up with two lamer stories.  I suck.  You always finish strong. 
[00:46:00]  All right, all right.  The tree.  You want me to do the tree thing again?  No.  No, no, no.  All right, all right.  Later, guys.  We got a girl checking in on instant feedback.  Jennifer from Queens says, I used a computer mouse the first time.  The round ball felt really good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's kind of hot because you know she was probably looking at some pictures and she's  rubbing the ball of the mouse.  Mike, what's up?  Ew.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  I got a few things. 
[00:46:30]  The first one's going to blow your mind if you ever try it.  You know when you go to the beach and you go in one of the little stores and you get  that little cylindrical thing that's made of like a...  I've banged that before.  I know exactly what he's talking about.  It's like you have a balloon in a little water.  It's like a thick balloon, but it's in a tube.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me explain it to everybody, Mike.  It's like a thick tubular balloon filled with liquid, but it's not solid.  There's a hole through the middle of it. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And it's really hard to hold on to.  Do you ever have someone throw you one of these things and you grab it and if you squeeze  it, it shoots out of your hand one way or the other?  Yes.  I am so lost.  The second I saw one, I went, I'm going to F that.  I looked at it and I went, this is perfect.  I'm lost.  Great minds think alike, sir.  Wait, help me out, though.  I'm lost.  All right, give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  I'll draw you a cross section.  And what was this?  They went by names of water, water weenie, hard to hold thing. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, sometimes they have the little dolphins or something that will be put in the middle  of it.  So it's just a thick, elongated balloon, right?  Absolutely.  Here's what.  So what would you do?  Well, it looks like you'll cut it in half.  It was like this.  Hole went right through the middle, yet it would go in on itself.  It would do this.  It would go like this and in a continuous loop.  So you could just...  I don't remember that growing up.  Oh, the second I saw it, it was love at first sight. 
[00:48:00]  I'm like, I am taking you home and I am F-ing you.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  That's classic.  And, boys, I have another great thing for you if you want to hear about it.  French's balloon nut.  She's a stupid faggot.  All right.  Thank you, my dear.  See you, Petunia.  All right.  Petunia.  It was called a water snake.  I don't remember that.  Yeah.  Those are great.  I got the visual, though.  Byron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas? 
[00:48:30]  Hey.  Yo, I was wondering, do you guys ever have a failed session?  No.  One where you're going for like 10 minutes.  No.  You just don't know what to do, whether to keep going or stop.  Let me tell you.  You're a lazy bastard.  No.  When I begin that, I have to end that.  Finish the job.  You have to.  Yeah.  I've gone at it for like over an hour.  Oh, okay.  No joke.  Over.  Because at that point, I'm like, I am now obsessed with getting the job done.  You've got to get the job done.  That's a good work ethic.  And I wake up the next day and it feels like it's going to fall off. 
[00:49:00]  But I've got to go the distance.  All right.  And my interesting place, between the mattress and the box spring on a bed.  I've tried that once.  It didn't work.  I did try that once.  I did it once.  And when my mom was flipping the mattress, there was this big thing.  You know what the problem with that is?  It's like, man, I'm doing a fat girl.  Fat, soft girl.  All right.  All right, boys.  Bye.  Later.  Ty from Delaware brings up a great point.  What about doing it at other people's houses? 
[00:49:30]  That's the lowest.  You ever do the out-of-your-own-house jerk?  Yeah.  I'm trying to think where.  On my friend's bathroom floor.  The first time I ever saw porno, it was called The Fur Trap, starring Kelly Mint.  The Fur Trap.  It really was.  Yeah.  And I couldn't handle it.  We were sitting in his parents' room on the floor just watching it.  I had to be like, I'll be right back.  And I went into the bathroom.  I laid on the cold tile floor, and I just made a complete spectacle of myself.  I could not stop myself.  Tom, what's up? 
[00:50:00]  Hey.  Hey, Tom.  I can't believe this.  Trees and mattresses, you guys are nuts.  Nah, I think you're nuts.  If you're going to use something that's going to be warm and nice, I'm going to tell you  something, okay?  All right.  Potato salad.  Put it in.  This is real stuff.  That's like doing a girl with an STD.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Potato salad in a plastic container.  You put saran wrap in it.  You lube it up, and you microwave it.  It's got to be warm.  So there's saran wrap between you and the potato salad?  Right.  I don't know.  Lumpy ain't good.  I wouldn't want to eat it. 
[00:50:30]  No, no.  At least it's warm and smooth, not a mattress.  You eat it later.  You work up quite a hunger.  How does the mayonnaise get in there?  Ah, very funny.  I can't get into any food products or that stuff.  I, uh, I, uh, other people's houses, Opie.  There was one time I had a very hot cousin back in the olden days.  Dude, I don't like when you talk about your hot cousin.  It's just a cousin.  It's creepy.  Yeah, but it's kind of weird, man.  Very hot.  Very hot.  But you, you've said stuff in the past. 
[00:51:00]  I never did.  You and your brother really thought you was hot.  I never did anything.  In a hot way.  Never did anything.  I understand that.  With her.  I've never looked at any of my cousins and said, wow, they're hot.  You might not have hot cousins.  They're hot.  No, I was looking, and like I said, again, let me reiterate, I was young and so horned  up that I would do it everywhere, anytime.  So, I went over, I was visiting their house.  Hold on.  I got to get into this a little bit.  Yes.  I got to ask you an honest question.  Now, we're going back many years.  Uh-huh.  Let's say we're going back 20 years.  Right. 
[00:51:30]  So, you're safe now because it's a long time ago.  Uh-huh.  If this cousin said, uh, do you want to have sex, would you?  Now?  No, way back then.  Oh, back then?  Yeah, we probably would have fooled around.  First cousin?  Yeah.  Wow.  I would have.  That is weird.  I don't care.  Does this person listen to the show?  Uh, I don't know if we're in that market.  Oh, no.  We're close to it, I think.  I think it's just at the fringes of the signal.  And you would have had no problem with that?  Uh, no, I'm not saying no problem. 
[00:52:00]  Um, looking back, it's hard to say.  You know, awkward kid thing.  But, uh, who knows?  Maybe.  I think so.  That's being honest.  I was crazed.  I was crazed.  All right, back to the story.  So, I was at visiting their house, you know, and, uh, I was using the bathroom that was  off of her bedroom.  And, uh, and I look on the floor, and she had taken her clothes off and left them strewn  on the floor just as she had taken it off.  And it got me so worked up that that's how the clothes dropped when she was completely nude 
[00:52:30]  that I just had, I, right then, vroom, wak, wak, wak, wak, wak, wak, wak.  I just had to pound one out looking at the pile of clothing on the floor.  It's like you were playing.  I was insane.  It was like you were playing Pac-Man.  Waka, waka, waka, waka.  It was.  I, I saw it, and the way the clothes were, I was like, that's exactly how the clothes  dropped off as she was just completely naked right there.  How did you not sniff the, uh, how did you not bury her?  No, I didn't pick anything up.  I was paranoid that, that they would see that it was effed with.  No, I understand.  Don't make that sniffing face disgusting. 
[00:53:00]  Just lean over and sniff and be a good boy.  I'm with him, though, man.  I understand what he's saying.  He's a lie.  But you, but you don't have to go to, to that extent.  No.  Because what's already happened, there is a more of a, is a turn on.  Oh, it was, and then it gave me the mental image of the, of the bathroom, and the shower  stall, and the clothing, and everything, and that was just, oh, perfect.  No, touching them would have done it for me.  I stole panties off the neighbor's back thing once.  You're that guy.  I'm not a fetish guy, either.  On videotape, you see Jim Norton running across.  There he is.  I videotaped it because my panties were disappearing. 
[00:53:30]  I would wrap my mule in them, and, and.  You would?  Did that friction kind of hurt?  No, it would suck.  Yeah, gently.  I've done that, too.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, put him on.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Billy.  Oh, Billy.  Oh.  Hey, Bill.  Oh.  Oh, you're going to ask me.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Not much.  How you doing? 
[00:54:00]  Pretty good.  Good.  What do you got, bro?  You're on.  Well, you guys have been talking about what you've done, you know, what you've done it with.  Yeah.  Well, I've done it in some pretty effed up places.  I've done it in front of my sister.  What?  Yeah, she was in the same room.  She was in a towel, and I was on the couch, and I'm whacking away.  To your sister.  See, that is sick.  Good boy.  The cousin thing.  I did it in the movie theater twice.  The movie theater was full.  I was watching Wild Things, and the other one was Titanic. 
[00:54:30]  Of course, Kate Winslet was buck naked.  Hey, dude, did your sister see you?  I hope not.  I don't think she did.  All right.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  You did it in the theater, watching Wild Things.  I was watching a WWF pay-per-view, and remember Sonny?  Yeah, from WWF.  Sonny, I don't know what he was.  Yeah.  Well, I was at my buddy's house, and she came on TV, and I put a pillow over my crotch and  started whacking away.  Nice.  Very nice. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I'm pretty messed up in the head.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  One more, and then you know what we have to do?  Because we've got to bring the hotness back to the show.  Yes.  We've got to hear from the ladies next.  Yeah.  Enough with the guys.  Ladies.  I'll say.  We've got a couple ladies already on hold that want to talk about it a bit, so stay there  if you're calling in ladies.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mike.  The worst thing happened to me.  I've been married less than a year, and my wife walks in as I'm taking care of the AM 
[00:55:30]  lumber.  The AM lumber.  The morning wood, yes.  It was ridiculous.  She started smashing plates, throwing things at me, calling me a sick ass.  Did you call her a guinea brat?  I had no defense.  Godfather.  I hadn't even finished yet.  What does that do for your day?  Why do the ladies get mad if they catch you?  I don't get it.  She thought it was sick.  She said, I'm only in the next film.  Why can't you come do that to me?  I liked that.  She was more worried about how she was feeling versus what was going on with my morning issues.  Oh, you have a nice marriage ahead of you. 
[00:56:00]  Now she wants to leave me and take half my stuff with her.  That's weird.  Sometimes I like just being by myself.  You know, hey, you wake up, you got a kickstand growing.  What are you going to do?  All right, Mike.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Then you don't have to worry about her needs.  Yeah.  Her needs.  Sometimes you don't want to look at her stupid face.  Sometimes it's great to just pop in a porno and finish and not have to hear.  How do they?  Shut up.  You know, you're right, though.  Of course I'm right.  That's reality, man.  I've already whacked it to some of the contestants on opanthony.com. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  Have you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to think.  Is it Raven from the Big Wazoo in Columbus?  Shut up.  Was it?  No?  Shut up.  No?  No.  Actually, I'll admit it was Flame.  Was it Gemini from YSB?  Yeah.  All right.  Now you've gone too far.  Sometimes you just don't want to hear.  I'm finishing.  I want them out fast, man.  Just, you know, I want to be alone.  Yeah, but that's because you're just having sex to have sex. 
[00:57:00]  Why else does anybody do it?  I've explained it like this.  Guys want to have just sex.  Well, they want to make love.  And sometimes they just want to have sex.  When do they want to make love, Martha Stewart?  When do we want to do that?  Yeah, if you're in love with your chick, of course you do.  But other times, then you just want to have.  Make love.  Oh, make some of that love.  I want to hang a rope ladder out my window.  And as I'm finishing, put them on it and ask them to leave.  A fireman's pole. 
[00:57:30]  Get on it.  You're lubed up enough.  Goodbye.  Leave a little stripe down the floor.  Throw a purse and panties out the window after.  I truly believe this is why a lot of couples have problems in their relationship.  Because I can talk for a guy.  I can't talk for the ladies out there.  But guys want two types of sex.  They want to make love to a lady they're in love with.  And sometimes they just want to F.  I just picture the half-naked girl hopping on one foot as she tries to get the strap to  her high heel on the other one.  As the crap is flying out Jim Norton's window. 
[00:58:00]  You've got to go.  You've got to go.  Why don't you just have one of those big, huge police airbags on the street and you just  push them out the window.  Save time.  A few stories.  Yeah.  Bend her out the window and she's like, wow, I'm out.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I'm holding on.  I'm holding on.  Then you just lift the feet and tip it.  Jesus.  All right.  But that will break, I guess.  Right.  Yeah, ladies.  Ladies.  Oh.  Oh, my. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  I am not getting in a rocket car on the 59th street bridge.  Ron and Fez.  Weeknights at 7 after Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  1027.  WNAW.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027.  WNAW.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  You should know that by now.  God, I hope you know that by now.  We got two girls outside the studio that will be entering the WOW contest and representing 
[00:59:30]  New York.  One girl.  I didn't see the other one that just came down.  I hear she's hot, too.  This one girl used to go to our road shows when we first moved back to New York.  Yeah.  She would drive our listeners absolutely batty.  She has the hugest boobs I've ever seen in my life.  And?  And I think they're natural, right?  I'm sure.  I mean, she was at Webster Hall driving the crowd nuts.  Yeah.  One of our first road shows ever. 
[01:00:00]  And I got to tell you, I jacked it to her.  You jacked it?  Oh, yeah.  The pictures were up on foundrymusic.com.  Thank you, foundrymusic.com.  Giving me some of the best jacking material ever.  She's hot, right?  Or is that the other girl that just came down?  What other girl?  I hear the shoe out there.  Oh, boy.  You want to see Lisa now?  That one is...  Yeah, bring Lisa.  Are they real?  She was a bada bing girl, too.  And ladies...  Hold on, real...  Ladies on hold, stay there.  We are going to you. 
[01:00:30]  We got some great calls on hold.  And by the way, when we go back to the phones, everyone knows what we're talking about here.  We're responsible broadcasters.  Right.  So you don't have to give too much detail.  Yeah, we know what we're talking about, so just keep it vague, but let us know.  There she is, Lisa.  Lisa.  And she just told us something interesting.  She's now doing extra work, and she's a bada bing girl, Anthony.  A bada bing girl on The Sopranos, right?  The one with the antlers on.  The antlers during, what, the Christmas...  Christmas episode.  Episode?  Mm-hmm.  And what did you have to do? 
[01:01:00]  I was a bada bing girl dancing.  You were dancing around up on the stage?  Yep.  Any speaking roles in the...  No, not yet.  Just dancing around.  I do remember that, though.  I remember the antlers.  She's been naked on The Sopranos many times now.  No, not naked.  Topless.  Topless.  Well, that's naked for me.  Holy mackerel.  She's really hot.  What a looker.  That's Jim Norton.  He loves you.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  You should write that down now.  This, man, you are going to be a favorite in the WoW contest. 
[01:01:30]  I'll say.  Hell yeah.  Rick, you all geared up for the photo shoot?  Rick, I think you might have to do this photo shoot inside the studio.  Yeah, what do you think?  We just want to make sure the pictures are done right.  Well, for that to happen, the lighting has to be perfect.  And I've got the lighting pretty well worked out there.  Why don't you work on the lighting?  Maybe she could get ready and you could take some test shots and make sure everything's  okay.  Well, we can do some test shots in here.  Sure.  That's correct.  I like a one-on-one.  Hmm?  One-on-one.  You used to get, like, naked in front, well, topless, excuse me, in front of, like, a thousand  of our listeners back in the day. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Not only that, dude, she's topless on TV.  Yeah.  And then she stopped coming around because I think someone in her family had a problem with  her hanging out with us.  My mom just loves me too much.  Is that it?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I have permission today to be here.  Oh, good.  I got to ask, just because it's radio, how big are those?  Double D.  34 double D.  34 double D.  Wow.  Oh, boy, are they?  Oh, boy.  Lovely.  All right, Rick, why don't you get the job done?  Yeah.  Well, would you wow, ma'am? 
[01:02:30]  No.  All right.  I'm not ready for that yet.  We'll make sure we do a short break here so we can make sure the photo shoot's going  well.  Right.  All right.  Yes.  Are you going to be on The Sopranos this coming season?  This year, yeah.  I just finished doing filming for them and Sex and the City in July.  Are you topless in Sex and the City?  No.  No?  No.  What are you doing for Sex and the City?  Just extra work.  Kind of in the background stuff?  Yeah.  All right.  You have to start somewhere.  Rick, she said she's not going to do it in here. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  She wants one-on-one.  One-on-one?  We got to respect her.  She doesn't make me nervous.  Really?  Yeah, because we're asses.  See?  What's this wee crap, white man?  To all the ladies out there, don't be scared.  We're learning.  We're going to try not to be as much of an a-hole as we have.  We've been to anger management.  Yeah.  We're trying.  We're trying to be better, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, at least go have fun and we'll talk to you after you're done.  Okay.  See you later.  All right.  There she goes.  She's beautiful.  I'll be proud that she's representing New York. 
[01:03:30]  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Nothing.  What's wrong?  Nothing at all.  Why?  Why?  Why would you want any chick to wow in studio?  Come on.  Oh, Jimmy's a little upset with her.  Jimmy's a little upset with her.  It's just a principle who cares.  Jim.  Shh.  This one's a key.  Don't ruin it for the listeners.  I don't want to throw this one back.  I'm not throwing it back.  Sometimes you've got to negotiate.  Yeah.  We will sacrifice a nice wow in the studio knowing that she's going to be completely topless 
[01:04:00]  for about, I don't know, a half million of our listeners.  For our listeners.  And us.  And me.  The weekend's upon us, you know.  I need new stuff.  Mm-hmm.  Jim, it's no big deal.  I just hate people in general.  I spent $75 last night, and that's exactly what I should be doing.  That's exactly what I had to go to.  It was $75 last night.  Oh, you got one?  Yes.  Where do you pick up girls these days? 
[01:04:30]  This one was on 54th and Broad.  Wow.  Yeah?  Yeah, black girl.  Hot.  Sure it was a girl this time, right?  Yeah.  Was she one of those drive-by whores?  No, no, no.  She was walking.  They had the drive-by one.  Now, how did you tell, like...  I know, dude.  It's all vibe.  You just know?  Oh, certain things in people just really bug me.  Like, she's walking down the street.  Wait, wait.  I got to go back.  She's just uncomfortable.  I understand.  She would probably do it if she...  I don't care.  She's nervous, because she...  Aunt and I are intimidating for whatever reason when I come in here. 
[01:05:00]  With some taunting, she would have done it, but...  Yeah, we could have probably made it happen.  I don't even care.  The girl last night was really, really...  What, Rick?  What, Rick?  You guys want to meet Wendy?  Oh, my God.  She showed up.  This girl's been emailing us.  Finger in.  This girl has a website.  Wow.  You showed up.  Yeah, I showed up.  I told you I would.  Hi.  We have a winner.  Hi.  Hi, Wendy.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you guys?  Wow.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  What's the name of your website? 
[01:05:30]  WendyJune.com.  This girl is beyond beautiful.  Thank you.  Beyond beautiful.  Wow.  And you guys are all very good-looking yourselves.  Look at that.  What a diplomat.  She's very diplomatic.  Jim, why don't you ask her?  Jim's not happy right now because the last girl that came in here wouldn't wow real fast.  Thank you.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, we got a winner.  Sorry, Dallas.  We just took the title.  Wow.  You're aces with me.  Oh, my God.  You look like someone famous, but I can't figure it out. 
[01:06:00]  Who have you been told that you look like?  I don't know.  Anyone?  No?  Doesn't she look like someone famous, but I can't figure it out?  Oh, my God.  Very purdy.  Huh?  Oh, Tiffany Amber.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Okay.  I can see that.  She's better looking.  Well, yeah.  I'm not blonde.  She's not blonde.  You're obviously a model.  Yes, I am.  There you go.  Our first model, Anthony.  I finished a photo shoot for a catalog for Lingerie Company.  Lingerie catalog.  Yeah.  Those are always great.  Those were good in a pinch back in the day. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right?  The Lingerie catalogs.  Sure.  Well, Rick, why don't you get working because she's going to just destroy our show today.  Yeah.  Rick, are you a little intimidated?  The girl's a model.  She's had professional photographers taking her picture, and now you're going to be doing  things, and she's going to be like, oh, I'm working with an amateur.  No, no, no.  I think I can mold her to what I need.  So, you feel pretty confident about yourself, don't you?  Yes, I do.  Very confident. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, name the website again, because a lot of our listeners would like to get a sneak  peek.  Oh, it's wendyjune.com.  wendyjune.com.  That's the girl that is in our studio now entering the WOW Contest, and then the shots  of what Rick takes will be up on opandanthony.com later today.  Every single shot will end up on Foundry.  Yeah, this is another one of those where Rick's going to take about 100 pictures.  We'll have every angle possible.  Did that make you happier?  Very beautiful.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  We'll talk to you in a little bit there.  Oh, my goodness.  It's wendyjune.com. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my goodness.  What's he score?  What it?  I'm on wendyjune.com.  Wow.  Look at the pictures of her.  The little thumbnails.  Can't click on them because, you know, it costs you some cake.  I hear you.  You know, but the thumbnails.  Very nice.  Are they sex ones or just naked?  Nude.  She's, you know, well, not nude, but I just see her in a bikini and stuff.  Big fan of the show.  Cool.  She's very beautiful.  I thought someone was pulling our leg because she emailed us and said she's coming in.  I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever.  Where did you get this picture from? 
[01:08:00]  She goes, you'll see.  It's me, and I like you guys, and I want in on the contest.  Is that the hottest girl you've ever seen in here?  Wow.  She's very beautiful, man.  She really is.  Name a girl that's hotter than that that has showed up in this studio.  I don't know if I've seen a hotter girl than that in this studio, to be honest with you.  Brunette.  It looks like she has, like, blue eyes, crystal blue eyes.  Very nice.  Anthony.  Speaking of which.  Speaking of which, there's about seven new girls up on opianthony.com for the WOW contest.  Yeah.  Uh, Columbus making a huge comeback. 
[01:08:30]  Huge comeback.  I don't know what happened.  Uh, something happened in Columbus.  I'm looking at some, a couple of really hot girls from Columbus.  She does look a little like Carol Ault.  Uh, someone is saying that on the instant feedback, but this girl's hotter than Carol Ault.  Look at that, right?  Look at that.  That's a pretty, pretty, uh, hot girl there.  Yes.  From Columbus.  Hey, Ben, go, go to opianthony.com.  Yeah, Columbus gave us about five new girls.  Uh, Chicago gave us another new one, I think. 
[01:09:00]  What do we got?  Let's go there really fast.  We're up to about 55 contestants.  We're looking for a hundred before the voting begins, Anthony.  Now we're, you know something?  We're at the halfway mark, and I think we're seeing a little more quality.  Yes, the girls are starting to come out of the woodwork.  Uh, Columbus gave us one, two, three, four, five new girls.  Yeah.  And they're all lovely.  Uh, Chicago just gave us a brand new girl.  Uh, contestant number 50, Andy.  Very, very nice.  Daisy from Philly.  Not too shabby.  From Philly.  Uh, contestant number 49. 
[01:09:30]  I'm saying not too shabby because, uh, the lighting in that shot is a little rough,  and I can't really see her, but she looks pretty good from here.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, riskayvideo.com has given us $5,000.  Eventually, one of these girls will walk away with $5,000.  And, uh, Ann and I are working on, uh, the sales staff here.  We're trying to get more stuff involved in this contest.  Yeah.  A couple of more, uh, prizes.  A couple more, you know, throwing a few more bones there.  $5,000 is nice, but we're trying to, like, uh, you know, make it a little better.  Up the ante.  Up the ante, yes.  So, there you have it. 
[01:10:00]  Go to OPNAnthony.com for the latest contestants in the WOW contest.  And once again, there's a lot of tools out there.  They're emailing every day.  How do I vote?  There's no way, you can't vote if you go to OPNAnthony.com.  The voting has not begun yet.  No.  And it's not, we're not going to start voting for at least another week or two.  At least.  Because we want 100 women in this contest.  What are you laughing at, Ben?  A week.  Sure.  What?  Sure it'll want to be a week.  I said at least.  You know what we're trying to do is we're trying to put together a, just a huge, like, road 
[01:10:30]  show and we fly in all the, uh, the finalists.  Right.  But we don't know if, uh, we can pull that off yet.  That's what we really want to do.  And that would be in, uh, I don't know, in August sometime.  Just have a huge party and parade these girls out.  Yeah.  The place would lose their effing minds.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Those two girls just, uh, threw us off track, Ant.  They sure did.  We have a lot of ladies, uh, on hold.  Yeah.  Ladies, please, we need you.  So stay right there. 
[01:11:00]  They're going to talk about some of the things they used when they were growing up and they  had to take care of business.  I'm reading a few, uh, things.  Wow.  The girls are just as creative as the guys.  Some very hot stuff on the way.  The OPN Anthony Show.  On 1027 WNEW.  Is everyone back in? 
[01:11:30]  I'm here.  Ant's here.  It's the OPN Anthony Show.  I love this song, but I can't pronounce the band.  Sorry.  I make a fool of myself every time I try.  Stick him up.  All right.  I'll try again.  Karashi.  Karashi.  Close.  That's good.  Rick is such a tool. 
[01:12:00]  Rick is, uh, in the middle of a photo shoot.  I got to tell you, man, we're going to lose him soon to Penthouse, Playboy, or Swank.  He's getting really good at this.  But he's such a tool.  Do you see the concentration, though?  Oh, I know.  It's hilarious.  He's, uh, we got a couple of naked girls outside the studio entering the WOW contest.  And, uh, he has named some of his poses.  That's what I'm saying he's such a tool for.  There is a professional model out there.  He's photographing her.  Now, she's in front of professional photographers every day. 
[01:12:30]  She does lingerie, uh, catalogs.  You know, you're talking, people that have been photographers their whole career.  Rick, all of a sudden, is posing her.  And he goes, yeah, this one I call the Britney Spears.  And I just turned around.  Me and Garrett, we were playing foosball.  We just stopped and went, what a dick.  What?  The Britney Spears?  But he's dead serious.  Oh, he is.  He has a straight face.  And what is the Britney Spears, Rick?  The Britney Spears is a pose where the girl sits at the edge of the table or chair. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  She has her legs apart.  Uh-huh.  And she kind of drops her, her elbows towards the inside of her legs.  Okay.  And kind of works up her shoulders as her, her bountiful breasts jump forward.  That is the Britney Spears.  It's off a goddamn album cover that you probably have at home that you whacked it to.  I just like the fact that you've named your poses now.  What other poses have you named?  I've got the Jesus Christ pose.  Oh, yeah.  He does. 
[01:13:30]  This is the Hobrick Snob pose.  I like this one.  My personal favorite.  Why don't some of the girls get to do all these poses, Rick?  Um, because sometimes we're short on time.  Why didn't Flame get the Britney Spears pose?  You know what?  I would have loved to do that pose.  I wasn't here for Flame.  All right.  Let's grab a rope and do the JonBenet.  It's classic.  Her name is Wendy June.  Wendy June.  Wendy June.  You can go to foundrymusic.com.  Steve has already linked her website.  Wait, is she topless out there? 
[01:14:00]  Of course.  She's some, she's, she's great.  Professional model.  She don't give a crap.  Oh, there we go.  Hey, there she is.  Wow.  Amazing.  Everyone becomes speechless.  Oh, Ali has decided he's got to come down again.  What a coincidence.  Only when there's beautiful naked girls down here does Ali have work to do.  Hey, Wendy, did Rick do a good job with you?  He did a great job.  Rick's not done, though.  How many pictures have you taken?  I only have 50 so far.  That's it?  That's it.  Yeah, that might happen.  So I need a couple more.  Yeah, we got to get our pictures up, though. 
[01:14:30]  People are yelling at us through the instant feedback.  We want some pics.  You know, at first I thought our brand new consultant here at WNEW, John Minnelli, had  moved his offices back here by the studios to be more in touch with the programs that are  on and give his advice as to what would be best in midday slot.  Rick, why don't you get John Minnelli in here?  He's consulting the station here in New York City.  Continue in.  He picked the office right next to the studio with a huge glass window in front that just  overlooks the area that all these photo shoots happen in. 
[01:15:00]  He's left his office in haste.  Oh, he ran out.  See, I knew it.  He heard us talking and vaulted.  I think we just found the new midday host.  Yeah, why doesn't he look at some of these girls?  Maybe they have potential to be in the new midday show.  Imagine following her every day.  Oh, how about that?  There wouldn't be an angry bone in our bodies.  What?  Can I do it topless?  That would be mandatory, yes.  Of course.  Yes.  Isn't that beautiful?  That's part of the job description. 
[01:15:30]  I prefer a dancer when she's really shy.  Jim cannot get over that.  Jim has a real problem with Lisa.  No, I don't have a problem with her as a person.  I'm sure she's a nice girl.  She's a little shy.  I know.  I should walk into a comedy club one time and just stand on stage.  It'll be funny.  Oh, no.  All right.  I'm stupid with that.  Hey, Rick, we got to move on with the show, unfortunately.  Yeah.  So finish up your work, Rick.  Come up with some, what?  Do you have a Christina Aguilera pose?  No? 
[01:16:00]  Nothing like that?  No, but I've got some others that I'm working on, so.  Have there been some that doesn't work?  The Don Corleone where you put an orange wedge in her mouth and have a go.  No?  Rick looks and just goes, well, that one's not that sexy.  Stop your spilling it.  For flame, that probably would have worked.  That might have worked.  All right.  There they go.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Wendy June dot com. 
[01:16:30]  Check out her website.  Beautiful.  Wendy?  No panties.  You got it.  All right, Rick.  Go ahead.  Have some more fun.  Doesn't she look good leaving the studio, too?  How about that?  Rick's got great timing.  He was in Europe watching A-Ha when flame came in.  Yeah.  Comes back to work and he gets to shoot Wendy June.  Yeah.  Wendy is hot.  How about that?  Okay.  Candy.  Yeah.  Candy.  Hello.  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, baby. 
[01:17:00]  Well, when I was a kid, I used to use a couple of kitchen items.  There was this, I guess you could say it was like a chicken roaster type of thing.  And I used to use that.  That was, like, the first time I'd seen, I was like, this could be amazing.  You know?  And then there was another thing that I used, which is a little strange.  I used a Ken doll.  A Ken doll?  Uh-huh.  Head or feet?  Head.  Ken doll's head?  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Was he holding his nose when you pulled him out?  I mean, it was the closest thing I can get to a guy, so.  Yeah.  So where did it end?  The neck?  The chest?  Where?  Oh, just up to the neck.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, up to the neck?  Okay.  Yeah, he was, like, my favorite.  I was like, this could be interesting.  All right.  You ever try G.I. Joe with the Kung Fu grip?  No.  Just that Kung Fu grip hand staying on the outside, just kind of squeezing away at things?  Uh-huh.  Sure.  With the lifelike hair? 
[01:18:00]  Remember that one?  Yeah.  All right, Candy.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Candy.  She ain't going to fall for it.  Yeah, look at that.  She's, uh...  Janet, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Janet.  I'm telling you guys no.  Well, that's women do not want to make love all the time.  You're right.  We do not.  We do not.  There's sometimes where I...  You know I won't.  Well, I'm not sure that'll get through.  See, that's the type of speaking that will not get through on this program.  Oh, man.  That was really hard. 
[01:18:30]  Sometimes you just want a good banging.  It's true.  None of the lovey-dovey stuff to it.  Exactly.  That's cool.  That's always good, too.  Sometimes just, uh, you know, down and dirty.  Yep.  Hell yeah.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  I'll let you guys go.  Bye.  A lot of ladies calling in.  Cool.  Haley.  Hello?  What's up?  All righty.  I have a good one for you.  All right.  Um, I was seeing this guy and it was the sex date, but of course only the girl knows 
[01:19:00]  that it's the sex date, not the guy.  You knew at this point it was the sex date.  But it's always the girl that knows.  Come on.  Let's be honest here.  Oh, my God.  So you went up?  How hot is that?  Oh, wow.  Let's be honest.  It's the girl that knows.  Yeah, we know.  Wait, so you girls call it the sex date?  Of course.  You know that's the date that it's going to happen.  So when he picks you up, no matter what he does that night, he's getting some.  That's the sex date.  You guys.  There's these idiots out there that are trying all night long, but they're not the sex date.  But it's not the sex date and the girl knows it. 
[01:19:30]  You got it.  Okay.  Only a rapist knows when it's the sex date if you're a guy.  Every time.  This is the sex date, bitch.  Whether you like it or not.  Go ahead, Haley.  Roofies.  All right.  So it was the sex date and we're out to dinner and I'm thinking, oh, this is a sex date.  I'm thinking all about that, right?  Mm-hmm.  So we get back to his place and like all night long I'm thinking about it.  So I'm going crazy at this point.  I had to ask where the bathroom was.  I'm like, I'll be right back.  And I did it right there in his bathroom. 
[01:20:00]  Now, why would you do that if you knew it was the sex date and you'd be having some anyway?  Because I couldn't wait to that.  I had to do that first.  Then I'm calm.  She was so worked up.  Exactly.  She's so worked up that she had to take care of herself before the sex.  So how long after you took care of yourself did you actually do it with the guy?  Oh, I don't know.  It was like half an hour.  Half an hour later.  Yeah.  That's a hot story.  And how was the...  By then, it was awesome by then because I was already, you know... 
[01:20:30]  Ready to go, let's just say.  Ready to go.  There you go.  Wow.  Hey, thank you.  Thanks for sharing, Haley.  You're very welcome.  Very nice.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Damaris, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hi, hi, hi.  Shut up.  Well, there's no white girls in my neighborhood called Damaris.  I know, I know.  You know?  I mean, it's a Greek name, though, but I'm not Greek.  What are you?  Puerto Rican.  Hey, hi, hi.  Yeah.  Hi, now.  What's up? 
[01:21:00]  Hi.  Norton.  Hello.  I love Puerto Rican women.  Somebody told Norton that he knows who I am.  Do I know who you are?  Yeah.  How do I know who you are?  AOL.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, don't say your screen name over the air, but I guess I...  All right.  It ends in...  Wow.  Was I nice to you on the computer?  Yeah, you were like, show me some more cans.  Did I really?  Dig it, Wendy, June.  I'm sorry. 
[01:21:30]  Well, first of all, in a few weeks, I've been...  Damaris, what...  Oh, you sent me a link to your homepage, right?  Yeah, that's me.  Oh, I remember you.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's nice.  No, she's cool.  She's fat?  No, she's not fat at all.  She's sick.  Not at all.  Damaris, how much do you weigh?  Oh, like 160.  Yeah, she's good.  160?  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  How tall?  5'5".  Oh, boy.  I don't even have...  Don't even pull the chart out of me.  I don't even have to go to my chart. 
[01:22:00]  Now you go to the...  Oh, come on.  Nice.  I'm a thick Latin girl.  So I'll end the back.  Yeah.  That's nice, thick.  Good for spanking.  Yeah.  Nice.  I like big...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I gave my friend a lot of dance to that song.  You did.  Were you doing the butt dance?  Yeah, I was.  Were you just shake your ass up and down and back and forth and make you go in circles?  Oh, yeah.  Do you hang out in BBW rooms?  No, you just... 
[01:22:30]  I might have once or twice.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right, so what do you got?  Well, no.  For the past few weeks, I've been kind of, you know, at work.  So I go to the bathroom and I, you know, help myself out.  Right.  But yesterday, what happened to me was I got so dizzy and I got so faint-ish that I had  a lie down.  You had a lie down?  I had a lie down.  I was dizzy.  I was nauseous.  And finally, my supervisor found me in the bathroom and she's like, are you all right? 
[01:23:00]  So she went to...  She took me to the doctor's office and she's like, lie down.  And they sent me home because I couldn't work.  And because you got yourself so worked up by taking care of yourself?  It was so good.  Yeah.  It was so good.  That's not what I called.  I was going to say about Mickey Mouse.  Maybe you need a sandwich.  Oh, man.  You're bad.  You guys are bad.  That going out, they...  It's like, what to do?  Take care of myself or eat.  That's a tough one.  No, like Morton said before, you're bored at work. 
[01:23:30]  You don't know what else to do, so you get a bad one.  So what about Mickey Mouse?  Well, I don't remember what age.  Maybe like early to like 12, 11.  But I used to take Mickey Mouse with his nose.  And I don't know if I can say this.  Ride.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ride.  Take care of yourself.  Take care of yourself.  Nose.  Do your thing.  Uh-huh.  You know, you work it.  Later at night, because his mom has to be asleep, you know.  I hear you.  And after a few months, years, mom kind of was like, hmm, Mickey Mouse. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  I'm a dumb away.  Kind of.  It smells funny.  Oh, Jesus.  Mickey Mouse smells funny.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, how about that?  She used her Mickey Mouse doll.  Very creative.  Yeah.  All right.  I would date a girl who actually had like a little bear like that, like a Mickey Mouse,  but from childhood, and she would use the bear for the same thing.  Right.  You know, with face scrubbing.  And now she still has it.  And she's like, go ahead, give the bear a kiss.  And I'm like, I don't want to kiss the bear. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  But I did.  Of course you did.  I'm a nice guy.  You kiss the bear.  You kiss where the bear goes.  Women can do that, though.  Kiss behind where the bear goes.  Women can use that little, you know, a little stuffed animal.  All right, Tamaris.  Okay, guys.  Say hi to Jack Black for us, okay?  Oh, stop.  You're mean.  Thank you, Tamaris.  Jim just got it.  It's unnecessary.  Why?  She's a nice girl.  She's fine. 
[01:25:00]  She took it.  She was nice.  Right?  165.5.  Help me out here, Jim.  I see what you're doing.  But I'll try to call you out on it and go, what?  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not.  Yeah, okay.  Charlie, what's up?  I'd just like you guys to please keep the talking to a minimum.  I'm driving home in my work van right now trying to have relations with myself, some of these  beautiful stories from these ladies.  And every time Norton tells a little story, it just kills me.  Good.  You shouldn't be wiping your bag doing 50 anyway.  You're going to paralyze someone because you can't wait a half hour. 
[01:25:30]  Well, anyway, just keep the talking to a minimum.  The girls are doing fine today for a change.  Thank you.  I'm out.  All right.  Yeah, the girls are doing great today.  Calls are, yeah.  Tina, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Tina.  How you guys doing?  All right.  So you guys were talking about that stuff before, so I just had to go and, you know,  finish myself off earlier today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But anyway, what I wanted to say was that when I was younger, you know, it's sort of  like, you know, a little baby with a plug. 
[01:26:00]  You just try and put anything you can in there.  So I, you know, those Crayola markers, they're like kind of big.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that was like creative, you know.  A Crayola marker.  Yeah, because you don't have access to that much stuff, so.  Right.  Right.  You got to do what you got to do.  That's what I was saying.  And when you're a kid, you just got to kind of make your own way in the world and look  around, see what suits you best, and use it.  Of course.  Yeah.  But the message that I want to send to, you know, all the women out there is detachable 
[01:26:30]  shower heads.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The ones that come off the wall and they got the hose and you can put them anywhere.  Oh, absolutely.  I discovered it in Europe because all the showers are like that.  Yeah.  And they need to have more in the U.S.  I really think so.  Do you put it on the heavy massage mode?  Absolutely.  You have to, you know, twist it a little bit to get it the right speed.  Maybe it's like an anti-aircraft gun.  Yeah, totally.  Just smacking away.  You would never know until you did this that the pattern of the water changes.  Oh, it does, does it?  Yes, you have to, like, move it around and stuff. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  How about that?  Very nice, Tina.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That must be something.  Picture that through the steamy shower door.  And you can just tell that the way she's standing, a little bit like a cowboy, you know,  and what she's doing, hand down there, and just arched back, just maybe a hand against  the wall that's dripping with the steam, her upper car pressed against the shower door,  hearing the low moans over the sound of the shower.  Remember Kentucky Fried movie? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  High school, yeah, Catholic high school, girls in trouble.  Yeah, shower, it's hot, it's hot.  Teresa, what's going on?  Especially if it's in, like, the 1970s.  Me, Teresa?  It's not water, it's gas.  Teresa, what's up?  I just want to let you know that it's funny, because I listen to you guys on the right  home, and one of my favorite places to get off, I have a straightaway, almost right turn  on, right before I have to turn and change gears.  You guys were talking about it, you went into commercial break, I found me a good tune 
[01:28:00]  on the radio, and just before I hit the corner, kaboom!  So I just wanted to call and say, thanks.  Oh, yeah, when I'm jamming them gears.  Hey, it's a great day, I don't know what it is, but maybe it's just the stress of the  day, but that is the spot.  All right.  It just seems to work best.  Right on, cool.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  We're just about done here.  That was, Anna brings up, oh, you went direct?  No, go, go, go, go, go.  Anna brings up a point, because when that deodorant tickle first came out, remember the bottle 
[01:28:30]  tickle?  No, I didn't do anything.  All right, all right.  When I saw it, I was thinking, what the heck, where's he going with this one?  Tickle.  There was a roll-on deodorant.  Look, man, I got an open mind, but I'm like, what is it, where's he going with this?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's a roll-on deodorant.  Hey, this isn't my roll-on, it's shoe polish. 
[01:29:00]  Remember the old shoe polish?  It looks just like it, right?  It's a shoe polish.  What happened to my deodorant?  It smells funny.  No, I never used that.  But when it came out, it was called tickle, and the bottle itself was shaped, even with  the lid on, like a big, fat dill.  And all I thought of was, wow, girls are going to get a double use out of this thing. 
[01:29:30]  And she brings up the fact that she used to use that.  Tickle.  But they hung up on her or something.  That's classic.  Hey, Phil, what's going on?  Hey, just a quick question.  Remember the famous tape from the AF days?  When the chick calls up, and she's basically popping wet and puts it right to the phone,  asks if you want to hear.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  That was a great one.  You've heard that before?  No, I've done that before.  I love that.  No, no, no, no, no, there's a tape out there that we cannot play on the radio anymore.  We got away with it one time, and actually, the unedited version made its way to the internet. 
[01:30:00]  It is unbelievable.  Absolutely sickening.  You guys go, wow, Anthony, you freak.  I freaked out.  This girl was watching a porno.  She's watching a porno, and she's fantasizing about the girl in the porno being with her.  She looks so good.  She looks so good.  Oh, my God.  Phil, Phil, Phil.  Yeah.  And she's screaming to the girl.  Oh, yeah, I want it.  I love your.  And then she would describe what it was like.  Describing the girl and what was going on.  And her areas and everything.  And she goes, oh, my God, look at that. 
[01:30:30]  And she just worked herself up into a frenzy.  And when she finally let loose, it was like an animal.  She was grunting, and it was amazing.  Amazing.  I don't, I got to try to, I forgot all about that.  Yeah.  I think I got a copy somewhere of that.  It's on the internet everywhere.  Yeah, I've seen it on the internet, and it's an unedited version because she's cursing through  the whole thing.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  It really is an unbelievable piece of audio.  You can't get away with it, even though I had it?  We couldn't play two seconds of that.  No.  No.  No way. 
[01:31:00]  Phil, let me tell you something.  Times have changed a little bit.  A little, huh?  We got away with that one back then.  We can't do that today.  You are.  Ah, well.  All right.  Thanks for the memory, boy.  Unfortunately, we got a little too big for ourselves.  Yeah.  Back then, no one paid attention to us, so we could do stuff like that.  Let me hear it.  Let me hear it.  Dude.  Oh, really?  You do that?  Like muddy boots, like boots, like waterlogged, rubber boots in the muck.  I'm in a quagmire, Jim.  Just trudging through the swamp.  I love that. 
[01:31:30]  That's funny.  You know, that was the time that Bruce walked in.  B-b-boys.  The shwaggy guy.  Yeah.  He said, b-b-boys, what are we doing?  A talk show now?  What are we doing, boys?  A talk show?  Uh, I'm sure a lot of guys, uh, want to hear a girl moaning.  For the day, for 40 straight minutes.  For 40 minutes, boys.  Perhaps we ought to get back to the music, b-b-b-b-b-boys.  After all, it's called the only station that really rocks, boys.  Not the only station that really talks. 
[01:32:00]  B-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  You see the playlist in front of you.  Stick to it, boys.  How many songs are you dropping today, boys, so a girl can moan?  You don't get it, do you, Brucey?  Brucey, you don't get it, do you?  B-b-b-boys.  I guess this bit's going right over your head, Bruce.  Oh, everything goes over your head, you midget.  He used to come in and go, what is this, a talk show, boys?  Hey, it's working out pretty good for us now, Bruce.  Bruce Mittman, I'd like to introduce you to Rich Voss. 
[01:32:30]  Who's this gigantic man?  B-b-b-b-bull.  Our show has flipped completely around.  You know those little snippets of music we play going into every break?  Yeah.  That's equivalent to how much time we were able to talk back in the old days.  Yeah, they don't allow you to talk on this station.  And now all this talking here is all the music we used to play.  We used to have to play.  And then we slowly started turning it around.  B-b-b-boys, you only played five songs today.  Boys.  Boys.  what am i going to do with you boys i don't understand this boy perhaps you want a job on rko

[01:39:00]  house in his uh plumbing van because he was a plumber and let her out speaking of plumbing a little  plumbing and then i'd go yeah lay in some pipe and uh we'd have to get right to it because she would  only have a couple of hours there and then she'd get picked up again we'd just come in like a to drop  off you know a little uh get together he assumed my parents were home or something and uh so we had  to get right to business so the second she got dropped off like you'd hear the motor pull away

Whoopi Goldberg had some news last night for everybody.  Oh.  And then we're going to talk about these two lovers that were found dead with their car running. 
[02:24:30]  Cute little Asian couple, I think, from the names.  And as we go to break, Anthony, an old bit.  What?  Yeah, I know, I know.  That's a break.  We got to break, man.  Look at Rick.  I'm so excited.  That coming out show on MTV.  Yeah.  You know, it's something, it reminds us of a bit we do from time to time where we break the news for people.  Hi, mom.  I'm gay.  Well, we got the hi, mom.  Yeah, I'm gay.  But, I mean, I'm thinking just in general. 
[02:25:00]  Yep.  You know, we do it from time to time.  If you've got something you want to tell someone but you don't have the balls to do it.  We'll do it for you.  We do a really good job.  Mm-hmm.  So, let us know.  We call up the person and we help you out.  Yeah, we'll bail you out.  Okay?  That's what we're here for.  You're here.  But as we go to break, hi, mom.  I'm gay.  Fine.  Relating to the MTV thing, sort of.  No more who?  No more who?  Dude, I had a look, though.  It looked like you might have something for the show.  I had to look.  You were gay. 
[02:25:30]  I had to look, though.  You understand, right?  Stop ignoring me.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play, uh, hi, mom, I'm gay?  Absolutely.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  You got to try to convince her, man.  All right, I'll do right back.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me down? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah?  Well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, uh, mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I got to tell you something.  What?  Uh, don't get nervous.  That's what I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to call.  I tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  Uh, I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you don't, you never believe me? 
[02:26:30]  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah, okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I got to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  But I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell you faster that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right. 
[02:27:00]  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me?  I haven't had enough heartache.  I think, you know...  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Bobby, what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Okay, I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No, I was going to spring it on him tonight. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arms reach.  Bobby, don't give me that baloney, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She ain't got to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey, Bob. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  I don't tweak you.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah, I'm a twinkie, Bob.  That's how I got the throat this bad, Bob.  I've been swallowing too many ropes.  Hey, Bob.  Bob.  You're sitting down, Bob.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  You want to call your mom back and then call us?  Yeah, I got to get her head out of the oven.  All right.  We'll recognize your voice. 
[02:28:30]  Call back, all right?  All right.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're all burning it out, damn you.  What about the bucket of AIDS in the face?  You guys are fessing.  All right, who wants a bang of whacked out fat broad?  You're such a disease.  Shut up.  I'll cave your head in with a frigging spade shuffle.  The show's going bad fast.  Nothing's as hot like a P-Z-O-T-O-M-Y.  That was O-N-A quality stuff.  Opie and Anthony.  And a quiet taste.  Like roadkill. 
[02:29:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Chris, what's going on, bro?  Hey, man.  Yo, I just moved out here to L.A.  Yeah.  When are you guys getting out here, man?  Yeah.  I am dying, dude.  I'll tell you flat out, we're just not good enough for L.A.  That must be it.  Dude, it's ridiculous.  We can only wish we had the talent to be heard in L.A. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  There's no reason you shouldn't be out here.  I don't know what it is.  We've tried really hard.  Our agent is on it like you wouldn't believe.  He knows that is priority numero uno.  That's just not happening.  At this point, we give away the show.  We don't care.  We just want to be on in L.A.  But they got some incredible talent out there.  We can't compete, Anthony.  That's what it is.  I don't know what it is.  I know.  Sometimes we just got to step aside and realize we're not good enough for a city  and just take it.  Who are we to think that we could be on in L.A.? 
[02:30:00]  See, if I didn't stammer and stutter all the time, maybe they would appreciate me in L.A.  Maybe that's it.  I am awful.  Someday, bro.  That's a good luck, dude.  All right, Chris.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  The word's out there.  Why does Dice want to sing another Who song?  Oh, come on.  Well, I guess he's taking over.  You hear?  I hear me.  Oh, this is a fun song. 
[02:30:30]  Mama's got a squeeze spot she wears on her chest.  When Daddy comes home, he don't get no rest.  Because she's f***ing it all night.  All night long.  And the f***ing's all right.  And she's f***ing it.  Look, Daddy don't sleep at night.  Because she's banging it.  Oh!  The kids don't sleep. 
[02:31:00]  The dogs can't eat.  There's no escaping the music in the whole f***ing street.  He's f***ing it all night.  And the music's all right.  Oh!  Mama's got a big f***ing.  Daddy never sleeps at night.  Why?  Why don't he sleep?  Because she's f***ing that big fat.  Out and in and out.  And he's f***ing it all night long.  And he sprays banana juice. 
[02:31:30]  And it's all right.  Mama's got a f***ing.  Daddy f***ing it all night.  Oh!  It goes in and out.  And it all night long.  With that horse.  Come on and f***ing me.  Come on and f***ing me.  In the...  Oh, hey. 
[02:32:00]  I'll flip her over.  I don't care.  I hope so.  Mama's got a stinky...  And he never sleeps at night.  It goes in and out until I make a mess.  Play the banjo, you retard.  Play the f***ing banjo, you f***.  F***ing.  Oh, look, I'm dancing.  I'm doing line dancing.  I'm boot scooting. 
[02:32:30]  In and out, and in and out.  My big fat f*** goes in and out of this mess.  I'm playing all night.  And her f*** ain't tied no more.  Oh, oh, oh.  Fabulous.  Thank you, Dice. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, he's got more?  And there's a long intro, too.  Yeah, so Whoopi Goldberg admitted that she used to play on both sides of the street when she was younger.  Oh, yeah?  There you go.  Even at the time when she was doing Ted Danson?  Way before that, I guess.  Oh, before that.  All right.  You used to like a lady every once in a while.  Tidbit.  There you go.  That's all you need to hear.  It was nice of Zero to come out and say that.  And also, two young lovers who stole away for an afternoon trip in an air-conditioned car were found dead by relatives inside a Queen's garage because the car was still running. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, you idiots.  They should have known.  By the way, is anyone enjoying this intro?  This is great.  Yeah, man.  No, sir.  You know, like this?  No.  For ten seconds, yeah.  For four minutes?  No.  It's a big, nice, long, blue intro. 
[02:34:00]  Out here in the fields, a man has to fight for his meals.  You hear me?  I hear me.  I get my f***ing to her f***y.  I don't need to fight.  You hear?  To prove I'm right.  Right, Kenny?  Right, handsome.  I don't need to be forgiven. 
[02:34:30]  I don't care.  When men were oysters, they fought for their meals.  Back like the days when they fought tigers for the meat in the jungle.  You hear?  I hear me.  It's Teenage Wasteland.  This song ain't conducive to the nice man.  It was still good.  Yo.  I liked it.  Hey, maybe you can play a You Better You Better You Better. 
[02:35:00]  Shut up.  We're not talking about music today.  You better, you better, you bad.  You better, you better, you bad.  I knew you to see me like you.  Hey, now here's a surprise, honey.  I know that you have  because there's me in your eyes  for miles and miles

[02:39:00]  I took a standard size  old furry teddy bear  cut a hole  where you should cut the hole  oh  I think we can say that right  yes  yeah  filled it with  an economy sized jar  of grape jelly  grape jelly  because I couldn't find  any Vaseline  a jelly bear  in your foot locker  is bestiality allowed  in the barracks  they're paying for it  you eff it  the primates bear's name 
[02:39:30]  is Charlene sir  and speaking of jam  he was jamming  so  that's what he did  outstanding private pile  I'm going to make you  a bear effer  in my beloved color  happy birthday  dear smoky  hey  Pharrell  Pharrell  what's happening  where are you  where are you calling from  walk up  he's on 48  sucking down Molson  nice  yeah  I thought I'd  suck down a few  freshies before  you know  the happy hour ended 
[02:40:00]  so that I wouldn't be  flustered going into  the evening  you know what I mean  did you get arrested  this morning or not  no but my girlfriend  is getting hit on  by about 15 dudes  right now  and that's okay  with me  you know what I say  whatever you gotta do  baby  alright  anyway no  I didn't get arrested  but I had quite the day  found out my buddy  you know I talk all the time  about my mafia friends  in Philly  turns out my friend  decided that he would  sell the car  to someone  to make some money  and the next thing  you know  old Jed's a millionaire  wrong 
[02:40:30]  the feds know  that the guy's lying  the feds know  that I told the truth  that I was ready  to give him the car  I don't want the car  I've already used the car  enough  I've been in New York  he's involved  with the feds  I'm not even kidding you  that I've had like  federal agents  and like weirdos  and freaks  and cops in Philly  and cops here  everybody in my face  but they all know  that I told the truth  I never did anything wrong  except  I guess I used bad judgment  on leaving the car  in Philly  with an idiot  he thought he'd sell the car  which is owned by 
[02:41:00]  as you know  banks  so I got in all kinds  of trouble  but not really  because I told the truth  even my ex-wife  knew I told the truth  and that was good  because she hates me too  so Pharrell  basically you never  gave this car back  and you told somebody  that the car  is hiding somewhere  in Philly right  well actually  I told him  where the car was  and then when I  finally got ahold  of the guy  that had it  he said that  the car was gone  he had sold it  for money  and you can't do that  he had no title  no lead  and it got ugly  everybody was swearing  and cussing  and fighting  and threatening  he said I was dead 
[02:41:30]  about a thousand times  and he's five foot tall  and I said  I'm sure you're not  going to do it to me  so come on up  little man  I'll stick my thumb  in your eye  and it got vicious  and everybody was  screaming and yelling  and fighting  and lawyers  and everyone else  it was crazy  I didn't do anything wrong  other than  I guess  take a few car payments  but then again  you know  I ride those  OP scooters  and I'm like  I'm two  I don't need a car  but maybe I'll get  one of them  Globe Mercedes  I've moved on man  I'm in line skating

[02:43:00]  they knew everything  it was crazy  I was getting  phone calls  from people  I thought were dead  and the next thing  you knew  lucky me  I didn't lie  to anybody  and the truth  came out  and all I know  is that  it's all sick  in my head  it sucked  it was the worst  two days ever  for me  well I'm glad  you're alright  I'm glad you're alright  they didn't arrest you  there bro  we're glad you're alright  and you didn't get arrested  dude we gotta go  we've run out of show  so shake it up  and we'll talk to you  on Monday  alright  shake it up  alright Farrelly  alright you guys  me kick ass  I'm going back

[02:44:00]  his car  right  I guess somehow  he leased  bought  obviously he leased  it right  and then the lease  was up or something  and he was supposed  to give it back  he decided not to  give it back  he gave it to this  5 foot friend  somewhere in Philly  and then he told  the people that  wanted the car back  that you can find  the car somewhere  in Philly  oh the guys  got it  but then he admitted  that this guy has it  but then he went  to the guy  and the guy said  he sold it  even though he  didn't have a title  or anything else  I was right with him  wow  and the feds  were involved  and the feds  because you know  there was a little  problem there  the feds knew
