<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with morbid humor regarding the longevity of WNEW employees, juxtaposing this with genuine sadness over the recent death of a former boss in a car accident.  The hosts quickly transitioned back to their usual style, heavily detailing their recent stunt disrupting a Hillary Clinton interview on CBS with a megaphone and signs.  They played several listener calls praising their actions and the show's unpredictability, alongside a Delta Airlines commercial parody.  A darkly comedic narrative unfolded detailing the numerous people who had worked at WNEW, focusing on those who had left or passed away.  The hosts also criticized Hillary Clinton's interview with David Letterman, deeming it overly fawning and lacking spontaneity.  This segment was peppered with numerous listener calls, vulgar language, and sexually explicit content.  "Psycho Mark" and an off-air contributor, "Spaz," were mentioned as being present.

The show continued with crude speculation about who would and wouldn't be allowed in the studio, including derogatory comments about lesbians and a hypothetical offensive interaction with a female guest.  A pizza delivery woman, Mary Beth, called to discuss the dangers of delivering to "bad neighborhoods."  The discussion then returned to Hillary Clinton's appearance on Letterman, with the hosts and callers making numerous crude and offensive comments about her appearance and perceived popularity boost.  This spiraled into a comparison with Rudy Giuliani, featuring highly offensive and inappropriate comments about Adolf Hitler, and a discussion about mustache styles.  The conversation shifted to New York City's mayoral history, focusing on David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani, with highly offensive and derogatory comments about Dinkins' tenure and the Tawana Brawley case.  A comedic rap song about Giuliani, filled with vulgar lyrics, was played.  A caller recounted a story about employees urinating in pizza sauce.  The segment concluded with more calls, including one from a Port Authority police officer frustrated with Giuliani's treatment of the police, interspersed with discussions about technical difficulties.

The next segment started with a caller discussing the upcoming New York mayoral and senatorial elections and speculating about Giuliani and Clinton.  Another caller shared a crude anecdote about a stripper.  The hosts then discussed Puff Daddy's indictment, speculating on his legal team and the racial dynamics involved.  A song parody about Puff Daddy and Jennifer Lopez was played.  A significant portion featured heated exchanges with multiple correction officers calling in, accusing the hosts of lacking support for correction officers.  One caller, "Old Dirty," engaged in a particularly lengthy and profane argument.  A former convict and former minor league baseball player also called in, engaging in a heated exchange with a correction officer.  The hosts discussed their work ethic, the risk of getting fired, a radio host named Scottsdale, and played audio bits from Airsick Productions.  They also discussed a news report about Ben Stein being robbed.

The final segment heavily featured the hosts' perceived falling out with the WWF, focusing on their antagonism with The Rock.  They discussed The Rock's perceived arrogance and the declining WWF stock price.  A caller described their plan to protest The Rock with a Winnebago and invited the hosts to a tailgate party.  The hosts expressed their dislike of The Rock's persona using offensive language.  Other topics included caller anecdotes about "Hummer Tuesday," discussions about WCW, and a listener's humorous experience with a stomach virus while watching Psycho Mark on TV.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featuring humorous and crude summaries from callers, followed by a Psycho Mark montage.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You little freak.  Anthony.  I find you repulsive.  Opie & Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  It's like, it's kinda like a car wreck on the highway, you're gonna have to, you know,  tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie & Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  responsible.  We refuse to be 
[00:00:30]  responsible.  1-0-2-7.  WNW.  It is Opie and  Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining  us.  Here you go.  We don't have a  boss right now.  We're bossless.  Or do we  officially?  I don't know.  You know, all I  can say is within  the last, we've  been here, what, a  year and a half?  Yeah.  And I officially  have seniority over  everyone in this  place.  Hey, that's right.  Look at that.  Oh, no, which 
[00:01:00]  means we're the  next to go.  Wow, we have  seniority?  That was quick.  We've been here  longer than every  single person now.  Oh, my God.  It's like the  friggin' Gambino  family in this  place.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  I mean, NW was  the station where  guys, like, die.  You know, they  stayed here until  they died.  Until they dropped.  Their careers  were, what, like  40 years long?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:01:30]  Your services are  no longer needed  here.  Take the  cannolis.  Leave the gun.  Well, Paulie, you  won't be seeing him  no more.  Well.  Well, well, well.  Yeah, this was the  place where people  died, and within a  year and a half, we  are now top dogs.  We've been here  longer than anyone  else.  How about that?  How'd that  happen?  So, are they  speculating anywhere? 
[00:02:00]  What do you  mean?  The media?  Anything?  Can we talk about  this?  Are we allowed?  I don't know what we  could talk about  anymore.  Call upstairs.  Let's ask our old  boss.  Get him on the  phone.  Get him on the  phone, for God's  sake.  We're actually really  sad today, because the  guy who brought us to  New York, a guy,  believe it or not, we  got along with, tragically  died in a car accident.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, that old guy.  He's doing all right,  but he will no longer 
[00:02:30]  be our boss.  Yeah.  Aw.  So, we're kind of sad  today, to be honest  with you.  I feel kind of bad.  All kidding aside,  because he was the  guy who hired us.  Boy, all the  authority figures just  dropping like flies  around here.  What happened to  Roger?  I don't know.  It's pretty pathetic.  People used to come  here and, like, their  careers would end when  they would die, 
[00:03:00]  basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wouldn't leave  this place until they  dropped dead.  Like a time capsule.  30, 40-year careers at  this place, and after a  year and a half, just to  show you the turmoil  that we've been through,  we've been here longer  than just about everyone  now.  Opie, Anthony, you  two are the  survivors.  Aw, man.  Wait a minute.  We could do a whole  fucking thing.  Hold on, man.  We've got to do this  right.  Where is my music?  Hold on, it's late.  Oh, wait. 
[00:03:30]  I think my CD is  stuck in my big camel  toe.  Hold on, it's late.  Oh, look at this.  It almost runs over.  Almost runs him over.  Look at this.  Thanks, man.  Let's do it.  Where is my flute?  Let's do it.  Oh.  Just because his brain  was not one of these  survivors.  Freaking idiot. 
[00:04:00]  Like, he panics.  He's got to find the  Titanic CD, right?  And there's that whole  shopping cart filled with  all our bits and CDs.  Look how messy it is.  So he pulls the two CDs  off the top so he can start  shuffling through to look  for them.  There it is.  It was the one he threw  to the side.  Spaz's brain was damaged  more than the mighty  Titanic on her maiden  point.  It is as if a giant  iceberg struck his head  and dented his brain. 
[00:04:30]  Is this it?  Well, I thought we'd do  a different version, though.  Oh, no.  You've got to have  the real Celine song  when everyone knows.  All right, Celine,  you're going to dedicate  this to Opie and Anthony  for outlasting  everyone around here?  This song goes out  to those that sailed  on that ship,  that plague-ridden ship  that was WNEW.  You all know the people  that did not make it.  The Pat St. Johns, 
[00:05:00]  the Scotsos,  and the Carol Millers,  all of them that perished  in the wreck that was  WNEW.  Many have passed  through her,  but there have not been  many that still remain,  except for two.  Two that cling on  like cockroaches.  They cannot be killed  by ordinary means.  They outlasted people 
[00:05:30]  that we thought  would be there forever.  The ill-fated station  that was WNEW  and those that live on  within her walls.  Opie and Anthony.  The only two  survivors.  This goes out  to you two,  brave or stupid  individuals  that remain  at your mics,  at your posts, 
[00:06:00]  broadcasting  to those  who want to listen.  Those that used  to be here,  the Dave Hermans,  they are gone.  Remember the Gary Walls.  Wasn't he at the helm  when the ship  struck the iceberg?  I believe he was.  And now,  the latest victim,  Scott Herman,  the lovable  curmudgeon.  Could he be considered 
[00:06:30]  a curmudgeon?  We will miss him,  but we must go on.  Remember Roger,  the promotions guy?  Remember his promotion ship  hit a giant pop heart  and sank  on his first day  at sea  here at WNEW.  He is gone.  Steve and Sue  are gone.  Oh wait,  not yet.  You cannot consider  them survivors.  They've gone under  and we no longer 
[00:07:00]  see bubbles coming up.  Celine,  that's a coming attraction.  But two brave souls  move on,  clinging to the wreckage.  Opie and Anthony  are truly  survivors.  Steve and Sue 
[00:07:30]  have been under  the murky waters  of the North Atlantic  for months now.  They're turning blue.  Remember Marty,  Dennis Elsass,  and Pete Fornatel?  And look,  look at the lunatic  who's locked himself  into the engine room.  Vince Skelson.  We'll get him too. 
[00:08:00]  Jim Moynihan.  Those that have perished.  Richard Near.  Remember?  All of them gone.  Dano.  Remember Dano?  Gone.  But two,  two live on  in the,  the tattered hulk  of a station  that was  NEW  and is now  FM Talk  at 1027. 
[00:08:30]  It chugs on.  They keep their heads  above waters  to remain  survivors.  Remember Ken Dasha  and Ralph Totora.  Oh my God,  were there a thousand  people on this ship?  These are all guys  that were here  while we were here.  There weren't enough  life bolts  to sustain life.  Let's not forget  all the records.  The largest  rock and roll library. 
[00:09:00]  Remember Lisa Garvey.  Oh my God.  Gone.  Don't forget Joe Taggart.  Joe Taggart.  We can keep going.  For one week  he was on the decks  of this mighty ship.  Boy,  that was one of Gary.  I think Gary Wall  threw him overboard.  And then he was  at the helm.  Remember Gary at the helm?  Oh my God.  The mighty ship  hit many icebergs 
[00:09:30]  and these two  ass wipes  remain on her decks.  Bye bye,  Scott Herman.  We will miss you.  Opie and Anthony,  the two  survivors.  I can't even believe  these morons.  He's a disgusting  little man.  And Anthony.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over. 
[00:10:00]  This is sicker  than faces of death.  1-827-WNEW.  You didn't really think  we got fired today,  did ya?  No.  Did ya?  Of course not.  They know which side  of the bread  their butter  is buttered on.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony  show.  We are here.  We are live.  It's Thursday,  January 13,  2000. 
[00:10:30]  Hey!  A lot of people  thought we got fired  and that's why  it took so long  to get on the radio  today, Anthony.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  A couple of little  very important things  we were up to.  I was watching Hillary,  the videotape of Hillary  on Letterman.  That non-event.  Yeah.  And then,  ooh,  how to play  some Half-Life.  About it, right?  I think that's it.  Very important.  We were taking our time  getting in the studio today  and also in the  phone rings 
[00:11:00]  at my desk.  Yeah.  And I pick it up  and the guy goes,  hey, where's Opie and  Anthony today?  I'm like, well,  we're right here.  I'm talking to you  and Anthony's playing  Half-Life.  Aren't you guys  supposed to be on the  air right now?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  And right after I  stop talking to you,  I'm going to walk down  the hall and we'll  start our show.  Oh, all right, man.  I thought you got  fired after yesterday's  show.  That was just,  you know that was  the best show you guys  have ever done,  don't you?  Yeah, they like that one,  huh?  And so far,  everyone's keeping 
[00:11:30]  quiet about the little  CBS thing, Anthony.  Yeah, so far,  I checked my messages  on my cell phone,  God, about five times  this morning.  I was totally expecting  you to be going,  I thought,  got to come in early,  we got a meeting.  No, I stayed away  from phones.  Yeah?  Since yesterday's show,  I didn't want to get  that call.  Yeah.  You know the call.  The call.  We've had the call  in the past.  And to everyone  listening for the New  York Radio Message  Board,  go F yourselves. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, again.  They're trying to tell  us how to do our show.  Won't they ever learn?  It's just a matter of  time before they get  fired, just like they  did in Boston.  You can't screw  with your own company.  We didn't go out of  our way to screw  with our own company  yesterday.  It just happened to be  the only TV station  that we can mess with.  Doing some fun radio.  Down at the Letterman  Studio.  That's it.  They don't get it.  They'd rather,  you know,  what are we supposed  to do?  Get on and pull  a Penn Darvish  for five hours.  Do some Rock 
[00:12:30]  Blacks.  Talk about some  giveaways.  Yeah, I mean,  Jesus Christ.  We have to shake  it up a little bit.  And then whenever we  do, they get on and  go, see, they're  out of control.  Well, yeah, we're  out of control.  We want to be out  of control.  They're like, they  just want us to  calm down.  Yeah.  No one's going to  listen to us if we  calm down.  No.  Personal message to  Alan Sniffen, who  runs the New York  Radio Message Board.  type this, Opie  and Anthony, don't  give a F. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  And it's the  internet where you  can type in all the  letters to the F.  Right.  That sums up our  radio show.  Figure it out.  We don't care.  Yeah, we just made  a verbal posting.  We were on top of  the world in Boston  when we got fired.  We don't care.  We know what we're  doing.  We're taking chances.  We're mixing things  up.  We're getting people to  talk about this radio  show.  And what happens,  happens.  If we get fired again,  oh well.  Well, off to another  metropolitan area.  But trust me, we're  not that stupid.  We know what we're  doing.  This is how we do  radio. 
[00:13:30]  We take it to the  limit.  Have a little fun.  My God.  No one else in this  town is brave enough  to take it to the  limit, so we're going  to do it.  And if it means  getting fired again,  oh well.  Alan.  Go drill some teeth.  Go drill some teeth.  That's right.  Now they're all  writing.  I mean, they should  change the New York  Radio Message Board to  the Opie and Anthony  Board.  I wonder if he's  ever come upon a  situation where, like,  there was, maybe he  should have done a  root canal, but he  figured he's going to  just go crazy and fill  the tooth instead of 
[00:14:00]  having a root canal  done.  Just, I'll fill it and  I'll see what happens  because I'm a mad man.  Right.  I wonder if people  criticize him.  Dude, you're out of  control.  You're like a crazy  person with that  filling.  Yeah.  You know you should  have done a root  canal.  Mr.  Dentist.  And you made a big  statement today.  Opie and Anthony  will get fired from  New York just like  they did in Boston.  Will these two ever  learn?  F you.  If we get fired, oh  well.  I'm going to go to  dental school so I  can run a radio 
[00:14:30]  message for you.  And still be in the  business.  Oh, God.  Well, the phones are  going nuts, obviously.  Yeah.  Saw CBS television  exec in the WNW  building.  Everyone talking  about yesterday's  little thing.  We got a great  little promo about  yesterday's show that  Jimmy from the  production department  and Psycho Mark  actually helped  out.  Yes. 
[00:15:00]  They put that  together.  So I guess we've  got to take a quick  break, Anthony.  Quickly, before we  go to break.  You ever drive your  piece of crap car and  maybe it breaks down  and someone lends you  a really good car and  you drive it around  and you never want to  go back to your piece  of crap again?  What are you getting  at?  I left my laptop at  home.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Scott Colombo just  hooked me up with  this one.  This is the dream  come true.  Look at this thing. 
[00:15:30]  Adele.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of  this.  Wow, look at that.  Look at you styling  today, Anthony.  That's not.  Now I've got to go  back to my piece of  crap tomorrow.  I might have to make  off at this thing.  All right.  So we have lots to do.  Let's take a quick  break.  We're going to play  the Psycho Marks CBS  montage thing we put  together.  And we're going to go  to the phones next.  Everyone on hold. 
[00:16:00]  Stay right where you  are.  And if you want to  give us a call,  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get  to listen to somebody's  cell phone to somebody's  uterus?  More stupidity on the  way.  1027-WNEW.  And if you've got  something for the show,  212-757-1027.  It's the Opie and  Anthony show.  Hey, a lot of people  patiently waiting on hold  to talk to us.  Yeah, look at that.  Let's start with Mike.  Mike, what's going on,  man? 
[00:16:30]  Hey, what's going on,  R.N.?  All right.  You guys had me  sweating when I heard  that Celine Dion  Survivor thing played  again.  I almost thought you  guys didn't survive.  Yesterday was some of  the best radio I ever  heard.  Survivors.  Survivors.  We are truly still  survivors.  So far, we're  survivors.  I almost pissed my  pants for a half an  hour yesterday.  We appreciate it.  That's all anyone's  talking about around  here today.  I want to know what  you guys are going to  do today to top it,  though.  See, that's the  problem with the Opie and  Anthony show.  Now we'll coast and  the show will suck.  Yeah, we'll coast all  day today.  We'll live off 
[00:17:00]  yesterday's festivities.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  That's the problem  with our show,  though.  We're always trying to  top the last one.  Yeah.  Even if the show  coast, I don't think  you guys will suck.  You guys are going to  rock on, man.  All right, bro.  Hey, I got a question  for you.  Is that a train?  Yeah, there you go.  No, you're doing  all right.  Have a good one.  All right, Mike.  Whoa.  Hey, Nick, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I like your show.  Hey, thank you.  You guys need a theme  song for your show.  Oh, yeah?  As you start your show, 
[00:17:30]  and I have the perfect  one.  What is it?  The Rolling Stones,  the name of the song  is Out of Control.  Out of Control.  If you listen to the  lyrics, it has  reference to the  homeless, knows his  name, it refers to  girls, and that he  was drinking again.  It's on the Bridges  to Babylon disc.  I've heard this.  Listen to the lyrics,  and it's got to be  your theme song.  We know the song.  Thank you, bro.  Okay.  All right, man.  Bye.  He was treading on  dangerous ground there.  I saw you reaching  for the button, Anthony.  Yes.  Miles, you're next 
[00:18:00]  on the O.P. and Anthony  Show.  What's up?  Oh, hey, what's  going on?  All right.  I'm telling you, I  turned on the radio a  little too late, and I  heard that say lean  bit come on.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, I was  making phone calls.  I'm like, what the hell  is going on?  Did these guys get  fired or something?  You guys really had me  going out sweating  bullets.  I called my buddy  Jonathan, he's a faithful  listener.  What's going on?  You know, you tried  calling the show?  Yeah.  He said he got a  machine.  I'm like, oh, man,  something must have  happened to these  guys.  We're not going to  lie.  I think everyone's been  very cool upstairs about  this one. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  We haven't heard  anything bad yet.  Oh, yes, it was the  greatest interactive TV  I ever saw.  It was hilarious.  It was funny, because I  was watching a lot, you  know, with the delay,  with the radio delay.  Yeah.  And I was watching  everybody, you know,  watching them jump up  and down with that  sign, and then, hey,  you guys, go to  left, go to left.  And I'm like, you  know, that passed.  They were up already.  I know.  Next time we do  something like that,  we're going to have to  just dump out of the  delay so it syncs up  better.  Yeah, we'll enjoy it  better that way.  Yeah, that's what  people are saying.  We should have cursed  a bunch of times  before we did it, so 
[00:19:00]  he would have had to  dump out.  By the way, we're  looking for a tape of  yesterday's festivities.  Are you guys going to  put it on the  website?  We have a lot of fans  at CBS TV.  Sneak one out,  please.  We need it.  We need it immediately.  You guys got to put  it up on the website.  Yeah, we will if  we're allowed to.  We want the raw feed,  the one that is still  rolling when they cut  back to the studio or  to the video clip and  you see her all pissed  off.  That would be great.  Yeah.  All right, Miles.  I saw a video clip  yesterday from the  ballpark.  Oh, isn't that the 
[00:19:30]  best?  That was great stuff.  Yeah, a couple  having sex in the  ballpark.  It's on the  unofficial website.  It's a great clip.  It's unbelievable.  Make the kind of  thing next time you  go to the game.  Watch out for those  cameras.  Yeah, you're going to  look around and see  what everyone's up to  in the upper deck.  That's right.  All right, Miles.  You got it.  You guys suck.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Paul, what's going on?  Yeah, how are you  doing?  I just wanted to let  you know that  yesterday's piece is  the best piece in  radio I've ever heard.  Look at that.  Everybody.  I do have one  wow story for you. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, hit it.  I was driving on  Route 18 about  three months ago with  my two boys in  the car, and I  had a wow sticker  on the car.  My two boys, seven  and eight, turned  around to me and  said, Dad, look at  that Jeep.  Five girls in a  Jeep wowed my two  kids.  Oh, really?  Yep.  So now they're in  school right now,  and they're telling  all their friends,  and I've even heard  of some parents,  but they got wowed  because they got  one of those  stickers from one  of your sales,  girls.  I'm telling you,  the wow on your  car really, really 
[00:20:30]  works.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, it works.  I mean, we're not  going to spend too  much time on one  from that Wednesday  until like April,  but it's always  going on out there.  Oh, without a  doubt.  All right, Paul.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Keep it up.  Take care.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, you're next  on 1027WNEW.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I got to say that  that was some of the  funniest radio I heard  yesterday, and what I  like about your show  is that it's so damn  unpredictable.  You never know what  you're going to hear  from day to day,  and I got to admit  the Delta Airlines  commercial you guys do, 
[00:21:00]  it was very funny,  and the nigger  Charlie spoof you  guys did earlier  in the week was  hilarious.  That wasn't even a  spoof.  That was the real  deal.  Any chance of  getting the Delta  Airlines commercial  on today?  We'll do it sometime  this hour.  I just got to find it  or I would do it  right now.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  And I hope you guys  live long and prosper.  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Let's find the  Delta Homey commercial.  Spaz knows where it is, Ben.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Listen, the biggest  problem with what you  guys did yesterday  is how do you top that,  which is what the other  caller said earlier.  Yeah.  But you got to keep  crossing the line,  just like Anthony did  with that bid on his mom  which got him in trouble  with his dad's style.  I didn't think you guys  were going to be able  to cross the line  after that one.  You keep finding new ways.  Well, I think Mark's  going to attack the NBA,  NBA, the NBC Today  show next.  Hey.  We've been trying to do  something with the  Today show for over  a year and a half 
[00:22:00]  and I think we finally  got our secret weapon  in place and ready  to go on that one.  Like you guys said,  don't worry about your bosses.  Worry about us.  Keep going, guys.  Do a good job.  Take it easy.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Bye.  Matt, you're next  on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  I just want to say  yesterday's show  was awesome, man.  But let me ask you  guys a question.  When I watched a replay  at 10 o'clock  last night on Channel 2,  they didn't show it, right?  Of course they're not  going to re-show that.  Why not?  Because what it was  was a live stand-up shot 
[00:22:30]  for the 5 o'clock news.  Oh, so when they  showed the replay  it must have  edited it out then.  Oh, of course.  Oh, okay.  No, that was an  embarrassment for the  TV station.  They're not going to  replay that.  Replay it again.  All right, you guys suck.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Peter, you're next.  What's going on?  Peter.  Yeah, hey.  What's up, guys?  All right.  I was watching Channel 4  last night.  It was like the 11 o'clock  thing, and they're just  showing a short clip of  Hillary getting out of the  car, and you can hear 
[00:23:00]  Psycho Mark in the  background on the bullhorn.  You couldn't have  exactly...  Oh, look at you.  You heard Psycho Mark  on NBC, and it was  effing funny.  Yeah.  Funny.  Funny, okay.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You guys rule.  Actually, because I guess  Psycho Mark was closer to  Hillary than we all  realized, and when she got  out of the limo for the  Letterman show last night,  Mark with the bullhorn yells,  Hillary, show us your fun  bags.  Show us your fun bags.  So that sound bite was on  every freaking station that  was covering the Hillary  arrival to Letterman's 
[00:23:30]  studio yesterday.  Yeah, so last night when  we were watching it again  on the news inside, they  always have a voiceover over  her walking in.  They didn't show the actual  sound.  They didn't play the actual  sound of her walking into  the studio.  Psycho Mark in the studio.  What's up, bro?  Dude, I didn't even use the  bullhorn for that one.  It was just me standing  across the street shrieking my  lungs out.  You've got on every TV  station with that sound  clip.  That's what I intended to  do.  Very good.  A little O&A for everybody.  Today's show, next, bro.  Today's show. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, without a dime.  Yeah.  We can't tell them when  we're going to hit, but  we're going to hit soon,  right?  I'm going to bring some  sushi.  All right, cool.  Sushi.  For Al Loker.  That's like such an obscure  reference, no one even got  it, man.  That's all right.  Die hard, man.  All right.  Psycho Mark.  He's walking around today  like he's a hero, though.  He is.  He's smiling.  He's all happy with himself.  He is a hero.  All right, we found the  Delta Homie commercial that  that other caller was  talking about.  Yeah.  We'll play real fast, and  we'll go right back to the 
[00:24:30]  phone, so stay there.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you  about to be up off this  bitch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this  bitch.  Let me ask you something.  You fin to raise up and  get your travel on?  From the interior to the  exterior, you've got to get  your posterior in one of  these big-ass planes.  Shit, dog.  You lay in the cut straight  sitting on your ass and  getting your drink on and  your snack on while we  floss and fly this mofo all 
[00:25:00]  over this bitch.  East coast, west coast, it  don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your  ho and back lickety-splits.  No shit.  Then you'll be back at your  crib chilling with a flat  spliff, thinking we were  some crazy-ass angel.  Hell, these fat, round,  thick-ass vessels run up in  the sky so deep, it'd be  crying.  Yeah, you thought it was  rain.  So bring a towel, because  at Delta, it's laid out  like that.  Call one of these fly-ass  Delta coochies, and they  call them punk-ass 
[00:25:30]  co-workers of yours.  Catch the vapors as you be  off and about.  You going?  We fly you there.  You been?  We done already flew up in  there.  We got you covered like a  Jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loves us  some flying, and it'd be  shown like a mother  fucker.  I love that one.  We haven't played that  in a while.  Very good.  Let's go back to the  phones.  Pete, you're next on  WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, fellas.  How you guys doing?  Good.  What's up, man?  First off, I was in the 
[00:26:00]  crowd yesterday when your  boy Mark had that sign-up,  man.  I was rolling.  Oh, cool.  I was about 15 feet away  from the guy.  I couldn't keep myself  together.  Yeah.  Second off, hey, you  guys are talking about  that video about the guy  in the bleachers?  Yeah, that's been around  a while.  It's a total scam.  I don't think so.  The guy waves.  It's like a fraternity  skid.  He waves to the camera  at the end of it.  Well, that's fine.  What?  It's still...  Yeah, it wasn't like  he was busted.  He did it on purpose.  It was a total...  Pete, it doesn't  matter.  It's cool.  There's a girl getting  pounded at a baseball 
[00:26:30]  game.  It's cool as hell.  I just wanted to go  on record, Mick.  Maybe the girl had no  clue.  We knew it the whole  time.  It doesn't matter.  It's still...  She had no clue.  It's pretty cool to see  a couple having sex  at a baseball game.  She better believe it.  I don't think it was  during the game.  I think it was totally  at night with a bunch  of frat boys just  taking care of business.  I don't know.  It's a nice clip.  All right.  No matter what.  Listen.  You guys are all right.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  Later.  Listen. 
[00:27:00]  Bobby!  Hey, O.N.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  Yeah, look, I was in  the crowd too yesterday  and I was laughing my ass  off.  That was the funniest bit.  Oh, cool.  I was hoping to see it  when I got home  but I didn't  but a friend of mine  told me about it  and he saw me  in the crowd.  Oh, really?  And I kind of snuck around  when Kramer talked to Mark.  Yeah.  You could have fried eggs  off the top of her head.  She was so pissed.  We have a little clip  of her getting pissed off.  And she went around  to her crew  and I kind of inched around  and tried to listen  and I couldn't  but she was mad.  She was telling them  if they come back  and get the cops.  She was mad. 
[00:27:30]  The cops wouldn't be  able to do anything?  Yeah, I understand  but she was so mad  at him  and she said  give me a clear area  I don't want to be  near those guys.  Right.  I got to do this again  but you guys rock.  It was the best scene  I've seen in a long time.  I'm doing my newscast.  It was funny.  Believe me,  we were there.  It was funny.  Thank you, Bobby.  Take care, guys.  All right.  We're just kind of  doing a recap of yesterday.  We're going to move on  with other things today.  Of course.  Lots of new things  to talk about today  but this is what's  on everyone's mind  right now.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on,  Opie and Anthony? 
[00:28:00]  All right.  I am a new listener now.  That was the funniest  damn thing  I've ever heard  in my freaking life.  I liked it.  And that convinced you  to start listening  to the stupid show?  Oh, word.  You guys are the best.  The best of Howard  is crap.  You are Howard  is something.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What, man?  We're trying to get  a truth going  with Howard right now.  Oh, all right,  all right, man.  Well, let me just tell you.  They sat me down  and talked to me  about that today.  You are the best  damn thing in the world,  all right?  All right, man.  I got to go,  all right, man? 
[00:28:30]  Peace.  Thank you.  Eddie!  Yeah?  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Yo, I started listening  to your show  like a week ago.  Yeah.  I just wanted to say  yesterday was the most  hilarious thing  I ever heard.  Oh, thanks.  And anybody...  Before us a week ago.  Huh?  What were you listening to  before you started  listening to us a week ago?  Uh, like Hot 97  and all that garbage.  And I used to listen.  I watched Howard  like a couple of times,  but he's like garbage  compared to you two.  You guys kick ass, dude.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Yo, how do I get  on that website?  Uh, foundrymusic.com.  Uh, that's with, uh,  the guy in the sex  in the ballpark?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a bunch  of good stuff on there.  Foundrymusic.com?  Yep.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Which is gonna reach  a million hits  sometime tomorrow, Anthony.  A million hits?  A million hits  for an underground website  for the radio show  in less than seven months.  That's pretty amazing.  Jamie!  Yo, congratulations  on that million hits, man.  Yeah.  Yo, guys, man, 
[00:29:30]  last night I'm driving, right?  I'm on the bus.  Oh, my God.  These people thought  I was mental.  I'm telling you,  I got the earplug in my ear  and I'm laughing my ass off.  People's eyes  are wide open.  Like, what the hell  is he gonna do?  What is this guy  laughing at this saying?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And today I had a couple  of cops on the bus.  Uh-huh.  We started talking.  Yeah.  They said, oh, my God,  we were rolling.  Oh, cool.  We were listening to that.  So, oh, guys, great job.  Any chance of posting that  on the unofficial site?  We're gonna try.  We're gonna see  if we can get away with it.  Clearance, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, guys, you guys are great.  Oh, thank you, Jamie.  All right, man.  Kick ass.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Cliff?  Yo.  You got some info  on the baseball clip?  Yeah, if you watch  the end of it,  the guy hands her some money  or he hands her something.  No, it's her panties.  Her panties  that were on the floor  next to him.  Oh, I thought that was the money.  We thought she was a hoe  or something.  No, it's black panties.  You can tell.  All right.  All right.  It's the guy and the girl.  What's the last thing  that started in here  before you closed the can on him?  What? 
[00:30:30]  You fell for it.  That was stupid.  I know.  That was really bad.  That was pretty lame.  John, you're next  on WNW.  What's up?  Gentlemen, how you doing?  Real good.  Happy New Year to you.  God, I leave town  for a couple of weeks  and what happens?  A lot of stuff.  Holy cow.  We've been on fire lately.  I know.  Real quick,  any repercussions  from the big boys?  Did you have to have  that meeting this morning? 
[00:31:00]  Honestly, they've been  very quiet.  Still in shock.  Yeah.  Sometimes when they're  very quiet,  it's not a good thing.  I know.  I know.  Listen, I meant to  propose this toast  when I saw you guys  at Hooters  and let me do that now.  All right.  A toast.  A toast.  Okay.  Here's to folks like us.  Damn few left.  Is that it?  Well, yeah, sorry.  All right.  I'm sorry about that.  And Anthony,  I know we've been bugging you  about that picture  that we took together.  Right. 
[00:31:30]  If you could possibly  give that to me,  I'd sure appreciate it.  All right, man.  All right, John.  Is that a train?  I don't know.  Joey.  Yes, sir?  What's up?  How you doing, bud?  Good.  Listen, I saw a tape  about a year ago.  Firemen in New York City,  you know,  they always seem to have  these great tapes,  porno flicks, you know?  And there was a whole  entire tape that was done  supposedly by the cameraman  that worked for each  individual team  in every city  in the country.  And this one particular tape  had all these scenes  where there was sex going on 
[00:32:00]  throughout the ballparks  all over the country.  Oh, there's a whole tape  of that stuff?  Oh, absolutely.  I would love to see that out.  Well, a friend of mine  got it from a guy  in the city fire department  and they were passing it around.  He said that, you know,  supposedly the cameraman  that worked for the teams  knew about this  and there was something  where they would zone in  on each section  on every particular game  and they would find  this stuff out.  Of course,  because those cameras  are so freaking powerful  and you go to like  the top of the bleachers  in Shea  and you're assuming  no one could really see  what you're doing up there  but those cameras  could zoom right the F in.  Hell yeah.  And they were picking 
[00:32:30]  everything up.  And the funny thing was  that they would show you  that they were actually  at the game  while it was going on  in the background  they'd have like a guy  pitching the ball  to the batter.  Oh, that's cool.  To prove that it was  an actual game  so the guy that called earlier  said it was just a setup.  Nah.  You could actually see  it wasn't.  It was an actual game  going on by the time  this was all happening.  Yeah, I would like to check out  the rest of the tape.  That's pretty cool.  If I get a copy of it,  a friend of mine had  about a year ago.  Right.  I'd be more than happy  to send it to you guys.  All right, Joe.  But if all you listeners  could see the whole thing.  All right, cool. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, Mary, you're next  on WNEW.  Yeah, I was down in D.C.  for New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  And it was, you know,  kind of cold out.  Towards the end of the show  they showed this Spielberg film  which was kind of like,  you know, kind of brought  the crowd down  because there was no music  or whatever.  And this guy took off  all his clothes  and he jumped into  the reflecting pond  and swam across  the reflecting pond  and like everybody  was like cheering  and screaming  and everybody like up closer  thought we were cheering  and screaming  for the Spielberg film.  Yeah.  And the guy got to the end 
[00:33:30]  and then he jumped back in  and like everybody  was like high-fiving  over stuff  and he's like running  around naked.  And the next morning  we were watching  on the Discovery Channel  or whatever.  I think it was  in Discovery  or A&E, I don't know.  But they were showing it.  But it's on film  because we were looking  at the camera angles  and we're like,  somebody has a copy  of this guy  swimming across  the reflective film,  the reflective pool  just before midnight.  Naked as a jaybird.  We decided that  they probably wouldn't.  What?  That must have been cold.  Oh, we were just,  we were cracking up.  The guy was insane 
[00:34:00]  and then we were like,  oh, you know,  they'll never release  this clip  because it's supposed  to be really tight security  and he never got arrested.  That'll be on the internet  pronto.  Yeah, I mean,  it's out there  because we were looking  at the camera angles  and the way they were  showing the Spielberg film  and there was definitely  a camera in that area  and most cameras  work by working non-stop.  Right.  So somebody's got that  out there  and it is absolutely hysterical.  I mean,  the crowd went crazy.  There were no police.  And this was supposed  to be like super tight security  and this guy's just  running around butt naked. 
[00:34:30]  It's just a matter of time  before we all get to see that.  Yeah, you got to try  to get at that.  It's absolutely hilarious  because they'll never release it  because it'll reveal too much  that they really lacked  security or something.  All right, Mary,  thank you.  Thanks.  Cool.  I understood the first  four times you said that.  She hypnotized me.  Sean!  Yes?  Sean, you're a new listener too?  Yeah, I'm a new listener, man.  I just got turned on  to you guys about three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago?  That's it, man.  Where were you?  Do you know what you have missed?  I'm telling you,  you guys make me piss in my pants. 
[00:35:00]  Sorry I'm saying that, though.  What were you listening to  before us?  Nothing.  You just throw in a few CDs  on the way home, you know,  or whatever.  But, I mean,  the voices,  the mic,  and the mad dog,  ah,  cool.  Hilarious.  Cool.  You guys are really cool, though.  We appreciate it.  Enjoy the show.  Thank you, Sean.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  All right, now,  let's try to move on  to other things, okay?  Of course.  We can start with  the Hillary interview  on Letterman.  What did you think, everyone?  What did you think?  What did you think of it?  That snooze fest.  We'll get into that next, okay? 
[00:35:30]  All right.  But as we go to commercials,  got to thank Jimmy  from the production department  for putting together  a little montage  about yesterday's festivities  with Psycho Mark, all right?  All right.  Check this out.  He can't seem to stay  out of the way.  We got Channel 2 news on.  Got a megaphone  and something to say.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  Causing trouble  on CBS2.  The hugest wow site.  Buster Kramer is a tight-ass crew.  This is like, you know,  I can see Big Psycho Mark.  He's a freak. 
[00:36:00]  There he is.  That would be a huge awesome.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Yeah.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  I'm CBS2.  You're trucking for me.  You look like a stock-raving lunatic.  That was classic. 
[00:36:30]  You Mark can't be doing that.  What the hell are you, Mark?  You're interrupting  our own news broadcast.  God's sake.  You know we're going to get  in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know.  Take them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Marsha Perry, she's very mad at me.  You tell her go to, uh,  R. Bonn.  No, I'm not.  I'm just, I'm hanging out. 
[00:37:00]  The thing is,  you should be allowed to do your job,  I should be allowed to do Mark.  I almost pissed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing  I've seen in a very, very long time.  Uh, Mark, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around  with that set, you guys?  What do you like?  Walk around like John Wayne?  Swaying like?  Yeah.  I just want to know, uh, guys,  when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you're going to listen every day.  This could be it right here today.  You never know. 
[00:37:30]  O.B.  O.B.  O.B.  Anthony.  One.  O.  Two.  Seven.  W.  N.E.W.  One.  Oh, two.  Seven.  W.N.E.W.  It's the O.B.  and Anthony Show.  If you have something,  two, one, two, seven, five, seven,  one, oh, two, seven.  We'd like your participation  on this radio show.  Yeah.  Uh, the fax line,  two, one, two, nine, five, seven,  nine, six, three, nine.  As we try to move on with the show,  uh, I guess everyone talking about  Hillary on Letterman last night. 
[00:38:00]  Ooh.  Boring!  Dave's a load.  Boring!  Just gotta say,  Dave is a load.  Everyone else in the media  kissing Hillary's ass,  kissing David Letterman's ass,  boring, contrived.  I don't think Hillary had one word  that came out of her mouth  that wasn't written for her.  Yeah.  Just, uh.  David just like,  oh, God, 
[00:38:30]  he had her right there.  David, you had,  you had Hillary right,  like, right there.  Yeah.  Ask about her husband.  Ask about Monica.  Do something.  I don't care what you promised them  before the interview.  Do something.  All he did was kiss her ass,  say that she would make a fine senator,  as would Rudy.  Boy,  if that isn't riding the fence,  you can't say both of them  would make a good senator.  Right.  He said, uh,  what did he say?  He said that, uh,  they're both great, uh,  candidates for the senator.  Yeah.  They're both running, 
[00:39:00]  and, and the problem is  we're going to lose  one good senator out of this.  Just lapping her buttocks.  Just kissing up.  Ugh.  I mean,  everybody saw it last night,  and I was just like,  I was expecting so much more  from David Letterman.  Come on, David.  The truth of the matter is  Dave's getting, uh,  he's getting a little old.  And it's showing.  It really is.  That whole thing he was doing,  you know,  the government control the weather.  Right. 
[00:39:30]  You know,  that whole bit that he does  and makes the funny faces.  Yeah.  Don't work anymore.  No.  Like, that whole act  doesn't quite wash anymore.  And do you honestly think  that test about New York  wasn't set up  where they gave Hillary  all the answers?  I mean, obviously,  a bunch of, you know,  easy questions.  Right.  But Hillary would have never  taken the chance live on a show.  Hell no.  To answer questions about New York.  No.  The whole damn thing  was contrived.  Fake, phony, boring.  Even having Walter Cronkite 
[00:40:00]  come out in the beginning  to tell David  not to be a jackass  when he interviews Hillary.  Dave, don't be a jackass.  Let Hillary come out here  and interview her  and kiss her big fat white ass.  I mean, what has happened  to the spontaneity of TV?  Her butt crack looks like  the trenches I was in  reporting from the tech  offensive in Vietnam.  Back in 1968  when the tech offensive  when I was in a foxhole  that looked just like  her big, fat ass crack. 
[00:40:30]  Just laughing.  If they had any balls  at that show,  they would have had  Rudy Giuliani come out  at the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Oh, so they're going to get  mad at you that you did it?  Who cares?  Bend her over the chair.  Start plowing.  Imagine that one.  Yeah.  Dave and Rudy put Hillary  on the rotisserie  and play cards on her back.  Now that's a show.  You know, and I think  it's very obvious to everyone 
[00:41:00]  that David Letterman  really likes Rudy Giuliani.  He's been on the show  for many, many times  in the past.  Yeah.  And, ah,  very disappointing.  He had to get her on  and then he just  sucked up to her.  That was it.  That was the entire  friggin' show.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, let's see  what everyone else  is saying about it.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  That interview was lame.  It was...  Completely not our lame.  It was disappointing  and then giving her  a tractor at the end  and then she's reading 
[00:41:30]  her own top ten list  that was obviously  written for her.  It was just...  God, I was so disappointed.  I really was.  Ranked up there  with like Joan London  and Michael Jackson.  Yeah, pretty much.  I forgot about that one.  Sure.  That's an old reference.  All right, Rich.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Jason.  Yes, sir.  What's up?  How you doing?  Good.  Man, let me tell you something.  They should have had  Rudy on the show with her.  Of course.  That would have made it  a whole lot better. 
[00:42:00]  I'm sure there were  promises made like,  look, you know,  when Hillary comes on,  we don't want you  talking about Monica  or Bill's infidelity.  Exactly.  We don't want any  mentions of Rudy, really.  We certainly don't want  him to show up  on the show.  I'm sure there are  all sorts of stipulations.  God, David,  if you had balls,  you'd just say yes,  yes, yes,  okay, we won't do  any of that,  and then you'd do  all of it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You got it.  That's what they were doing.  Man, but let me tell you,  Letterman, 
[00:42:30]  he should have had it  right there.  He had his whole  opportunity to say  whatever he wanted to.  Yeah, he blew it.  He blew it.  Definitely.  I think so.  I think Letterman  needs to get out.  You just have to go for it  at that point.  Maybe it's a little shaky  in there, though.  Maybe it's a little scary  with Secret Service  all around.  She's there.  What are they going to do,  shoot you for asking  a stupid question?  I think it'd be funny  to have her walk off  your show  because she's pissed.  That'd make more news.  The news crews 
[00:43:00]  are all outside  the studio.  Here's Hillary.  She's doing a talk show.  Oh, boy.  Who cares?  I watched a bunch  of editorials  this morning  back in the office.  All the media  was kissing her ass.  Oh, we thought  she looked terrific.  She was so funny.  Funny, that's another thing.  She's saying stuff.  Come on, but if you  had her in front of you,  you wouldn't kiss her ass?  No.  No?  No.  Oh, come on.  In casual conversations,  some of the stuff  she was saying  might be funny,  you know?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden,  Dave is just cracking up 
[00:43:30]  like it is the funniest  damn thing ever.  And does Paul Schaefer  go back to the  mothership at night?  Does he go back  and, right,  and just, like,  cruise off to whatever  galaxy he's from  through the black hole  and then come back  every day?  Does he commute  from his planet?  Or does he live here?  Holy mother of pearl,  does he look like  an alien now?  He should have left  the wraparound horseshoe hair  that he had  for years.  Which wasn't that,  you know,  wasn't all that bad. 
[00:44:00]  He lost his hair  for years ago.  Everyone's known  Paul Schaefer  as being the bald guy.  And he doesn't even  speak English anymore.  I don't know what it is.  David asks him stuff  and, yeah,  just like that.  That's his native language  from Udabunabu,  the planet of  Baltar.  Well, Mike thought  Hillary came off  pretty good.  Mike?  Really?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's going on, man?  You liked her  on Letterman last night,  huh?  I have to say  that I actually did. 
[00:44:30]  I mean,  it was kind of gay.  I mean,  I admit Letterman  was kind of punked out,  but I will say this.  She came off  pretty good.  I mean,  maybe it was scripted.  Because, yeah,  that's how it was written  for her to come off  pretty good.  Pretty much.  She wouldn't have done it  unless she came off  looking good.  Pretty much every line  she said was written for her  and she didn't even  rehearse her lines.  That part was very obvious.  Come on this show  and then see  if you come off  looking good.  She was a little nervous,  you could tell,  but I will say this.  I mean,  wouldn't you rather  see her in there  than Giuliani?  I mean,  come on.  Nah,  Rudy's pretty funny  on the show. 
[00:45:00]  Rudy is funny on the show.  You see him dressed like a bitch  on Saturday Night Live?  Yeah,  the guy knows how to have fun.  Yeah.  The best thing Giuliani's done  for the city  is,  I think,  clean up the subway  and clean up the village.  But other than that,  I mean,  he hates New York nightlife.  He hates clubs.  He hates anything  that really has anything  to do with fun,  I noticed.  You know,  like he's always  like raiding nightclubs.  I'm not having any help  nicer than anyone else.  Yeah,  I mean,  but I don't know,  I think it would be  kind of interesting  to see her in there.  I mean,  she doesn't seem  as phony,  you know, 
[00:45:30]  as I might have thought  she did.  I kind of see her  in a different light.  That's her act,  is to look not phony.  The phoniness  of looking not phony.  Yeah,  I mean,  I can't stand her.  Of course she's a phony.  She's living with her husband  who she can't friggin' stand.  They can't stand each other.  But to her,  he's just a banging Arkansas slob.  You just can't keep it  in his pants.  And to him,  she's just a power-hungry dyke  who's trying to ride 
[00:46:00]  his coattails  into political office.  There you go.  There's the relationship  in a nutshell.  Thank you.  The minute the presidency's over,  she's definitely dumping him.  I'll say that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, Mike,  thank you.  Thank you, man.  Bye.  I was sitting there  watching last night  though,  and going,  you know,  if Hillary makes  a legit Senate run  and she has to reach  like the young voters,  we would definitely  be in the running.  What,  to get her on the show?  Yeah.  We reach a lot  of the young voters.  That's going to happen. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  It's a possibility.  Oh, yeah.  It's a possibility.  Like Clinton  playing the sax  on MTV and stuff  to try to get  the young voters.  Uh-huh.  So you,  and I believe Clinton  was on,  who was I Miss His Show?  Yep.  A while ago,  like eight years ago  when he was first running.  So you think  we'd have a shot?  We have a huge segment  of the young voters.  Uh-huh.  She's got to go  on some radio shows.  Uh-huh.  I'm telling you.  Lesbian couch  for Hillary?  Would we do that?  She'd probably 
[00:47:00]  jump right on it.  Jump right on it.  Give me a face.  I'm on it.  We would have to  support her,  I believe,  if she did a round  on the lesbian couch.  Oh, Hillary.  Screw her.  Looked it in today.  It's Jay Moore.  She's going to try  to get your clothes off.  Well, let's get  a female point of view  on last night.  Mary Beth,  you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  All right.  Listen, I think you guys  should interview Hillary Clinton.  You do a lot better job.  Well, that's what we're saying.  We would, uh, 
[00:47:30]  we would welcome  the opportunity.  No, I would tell you  what we would do, okay?  What?  They would sit us down,  all her people,  and say, look,  you know,  we're going to give you  an opportunity of a lifetime.  You get to interview  the first lady  about her Senate run,  but you can't mention Monica.  Oh, no.  Can't talk about Bill  and his infidelity.  No, no, no.  Can't have Rudy  as a surprise guest.  Yes.  Got to keep the lesbians  out of the studio that day.  And you do it all.  Make sure the egg shooter  is nowhere near the building.  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  How about Old Dirty?  You think he'd be allowed in?  Old Dirty? 
[00:48:00]  No, Hillary,  that's my word.  You got a big butt.  That's a,  oh, man,  look at that ass.  Gene, come on, kid.  They're going to say  Jay Moore has to be in L.A.  They'll give us  this whole list of things.  Yeah.  And Aunt and I,  like good little boys  like we do,  very well off the air,  we'll go,  yes, sir, yes, sir.  No, no, we wouldn't do that.  No, no, no, no.  No, we won't do that.  Okay.  All right.  She would come in  and we would do it all.  She'd sit down  and all of a sudden,  hey, whore,  huh?  How you doing,  you whore?  Where's your husband? 
[00:48:30]  Where's his penis?  Huh?  You ain't seen that  quite a while after.  Yo-ho-ho.  That'd be fun.  Some dice to the interview.  All right, Mary Beth.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  I love you.  You have saved me  so many times  from road rage.  I deliver pizzas  during the day  and during the afternoon  and I want to run people  over numerous times sometimes.  You deliver pizzas?  Yeah.  Do you deliver  to the bad neighborhoods?  No, they won't let me.  Yeah, see?  I saw a TV show  on this, though.  A lot of the pizza places 
[00:49:00]  are getting in trouble now.  I'm getting sued.  Getting sued  for millions of dollars.  I saw that on Dateline.  Yeah.  Really?  20 or 60 Minutes.  Because they're not  sending the delivery people  to bad neighborhoods.  Oh, yeah.  When you get a phone call  from a bad neighborhood,  it's like,  no, we don't deliver.  Yeah.  And people are suing?  Like, what kind of girl are you?  Like, describe yourself quickly.  5'3", brown hair, brown eyes.  How much you weigh?  Like 120.  Yeah, you're 5'3", 120.  You're a little girl.  Yeah.  And she's going to, like, 
[00:49:30]  go deliver pizza?  In a bad neighborhood.  In the hood.  You know, you never know  what'll happen to you.  And there was a reason  why they started this  because a lot of their drivers  were being held up and robbed.  So I think it was in Washington  and St. Louis,  if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah.  So these pizza chains finally said,  look, we are not delivering  to these neighborhoods anymore.  It's not worth it.  You know, our drivers are,  their lives are in risk.  Right.  Certainly, they're going to,  you know, there's a chance  of getting robbed  and their money stolen.  It's not worth the chance. 
[00:50:00]  Mary Beth would be the only  pizza delivery person  that leaves with extra sausage.  Right?  You go to that neighborhood,  you never know.  Yeah, right?  Ready for this one, though, Ant?  So then another pizza company  decided, okay,  we'll continue delivering  in the bad neighborhoods  even though we've had  some serious trouble,  but we're going to make  the people meet us outside  to make the exchange.  Yeah.  That company is now getting sued  for trying to do  the right thing as well.  Yeah, like they had to  walk up to the car.  Yeah, like a drug deal. 
[00:50:30]  Like when you see cops  and they're selling crack,  like they go into the neighborhood  and the guy comes up  with the crack  and they sell it  through the car window.  So that's exactly  what the pizza deal  looked like.  Yeah.  Don't matter what you need.  Yeah.  I got it.  What you need, man?  Yeah, a little anchovy.  And I'd like to say  go UConn, all right?  All right.  I go there  and I'm deprived of you guys.  In the wintertime,  I hate it.  UConn has a just sick team  once again this year.  Yeah, well,  we're number five now, but...  Well, you guys are going  to be right there  at the end again.  You think?  Well, St. John's. 
[00:51:00]  Come on, baby.  St. John's.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the 16th.  Come on.  Who are you cheering for?  St. John's.  What?  I'm a New Yorker.  No, I'm not from Connecticut.  Well, I'm not either,  but, you know,  I got to cheer for my school.  I went to the St. John's,  yeah, St. John's UConn game  last year at the Garden.  Uh-huh.  And I was really pissed off  because there were more  Connecticut fans there  than New York fans.  Oh, yeah.  We support our team.  Our home court,  and all I heard was  Connecticut's, you know,  cheering like a mother.  Oh, we are loud. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I don't know much  about any basketball,  especially college,  but one thing I do know,  the UConn fans are crazy.  We are crazy.  All right, Mary Beth.  Let me tell you.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  That's crazy as you can get  in Connecticut.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, let's be real here.  All right.  We'll take a few more calls  on the Hillary Letterman thing,  and we'll move on  to other things,  so stay right there.  Thank you.  You can write some times,  like, piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:52:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  How annoying that must be  for our listeners.  Prodigy.  Come in,  and we're just, like,  yelling at the music.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  The Opie and Anthony Shoe.  Yes.  Having a lot of fun  taking your phone calls.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:52:30]  Talking about Hillary  and David Letterman.  Yes.  Seems like everyone  stayed up to watch that  last night.  Oh, brother.  Great.  I'm surprised to see  Walter Cronkite still alive.  Walter Cronkite.  My mere first lady,  Hillary Clinton,  I remember when I was  with Eleanor Roosevelt,  bent her over the couch  in the Lincoln Bedroom.  Dave.  What, did he have  a big old hearing aid  in his head?  I had a huge hearing aid. 
[00:53:00]  Like, does he need  a big, huge one?  It's Walter Cronkite.  Can't you get one of those  little ones that go in the ear?  But look like I have  a satellite receiver  in my head.  And then Dave's going,  wow, didn't Walter Cronkite  look great?  What?  What, Dave?  What were you,  Jay Leno?  No, I can't hear you.  Don't say anything stupid.  He called him a jackass.  Dave, you're a jackass.  Joey!  Walter Cronkite.  Yo!  What's up?  What's up, O&A?  Talking to you.  Hey, man. 
[00:53:30]  Thinking, thinking  Hillary's real hot, bro.  What?  Got a thing for her.  Wow, you're effed up.  Yeah, you gotta get  some of that laser surgery  on your eyes, man.  I'm wrong, man.  You're wrong.  A little secret thing  with Hillary?  That's wrong.  Most powerful woman  in the world?  Dude, she's a weeble.  Anyone else notice that?  She's not the most  powerful woman  in the world.  Oh, my God.  She wields nothing.  She wishes she had  a schlong,  and she doesn't.  Come on, tell the truth.  You won't want  to see a buck naked. 
[00:54:00]  Ugh.  As part of, like,  a cottage cheese ass.  Let me answer him, Joey.  Joey, as part of, like,  a freak show, sure.  A freak show?  I would love to see her naked.  Those big tree trunk  legs of hers.  Like in Celebrity Skin  Magazine or something?  All of a sudden,  you see her, uh...  That's what I'm talking about.  She is a weeble.  Weebles wobble,  but they don't fall down.  I mean, her body,  her body's like this,  right in,  and then it goes,  whoa.  She's got a big away.  I'm thinking she's hot.  I'm thinking she's wild. 
[00:54:30]  I'm thinking you're stoned.  Jesus, man.  What are you, insane?  Of all the chicks  you could say are hot  that have been on TV?  My wife thinks I'm sick, dude.  Well, I believe you are, too.  All right, Joey.  Get out of here.  You guys rule, man.  All right, go do another bong hit.  Later.  Bye.  Obviously,  he's got something in his eyes.  Ralph.  He thinks that big,  fat cottage cheese ass.  Hey, Ralph,  you still there?  I'm absolutely here.  Sorry to make you wait a while. 
[00:55:00]  What's up?  That's no problem.  It just proves to me  how stupid the voters  in New York are.  Hillary comes on TV  and everyone's into her.  And now the polls go up.  Right.  Why do the polls go up  just because she does a TV show?  Yeah, who changes their mind?  Haven't you made your opinion by now?  She's on TV.  I like her now.  Right.  She did, Dave.  And then Rudy will be on  maybe in another month or so  and then his ratings will go up  and hers will drop.  That's what it is, ratings.  It's popularity.  Listen to your listeners today.  They're saying how great she was  and they like her.  It was fake.  They can't see it.  And now all of a sudden, 
[00:55:30]  Rudy's a bad guy.  The sad part is  it's working for her.  You know, as voters,  we are so fickle.  I mean, the average person  doesn't know anything  about the issues  and we're just like,  oh, wow, she did great  on Letterman last night.  I'm going to vote for her now.  Well, that's how her husband won.  He played the sax.  Hey, man, that guy must be great.  I'll tell you something.  You know what the problem was  with Adolf Hitler?  No TV talk shows.  The guy probably  would have had, like, fans.  He probably would have, you know,  could be Hitler doing Dave. 
[00:56:00]  There would be calls the next day.  Hey, he seemed like  a really fun guy.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  It's just getting your face  on TV.  That's it.  He would have had  some stupid human tricks.  Oh, God, Ralph.  What happened to my guest?  Adolf Hitler.  You know,  he comes goose-stepping out  onto Dave's couch.  All I know about Adolf Hitler,  and we've said in the past,  yeah,  he's wrecked that mustache look  for everyone. 
[00:56:30]  The little mustache  will never come back.  You cannot wear that look.  Oh, you occasionally see  the Van Dyke, don't you?  You see the goatee.  Sure.  You see the handlebar mustache  with the guy that waxes the ends.  Oh, yeah.  It looks real stupid,  but you still see it.  You even see some people  walking around  with the mutton chops.  The big mutton chop  sideburns and stuff.  There's every style of hair  on people's face  you could dream of,  except one.  The little Hitler mustache.  For one man to ruin  an entire look,  a little look like that,  that's something. 
[00:57:00]  That's saying something.  Because before Hitler,  I mean,  a bunch of people  wore the mustache.  Charlie Chaplin.  Charlie Chaplin comes to mind,  sure.  And many others.  But since then,  what if you just  know you look better that way?  What if you wanted to see it?  You cannot walk down  the streets of New York  with that look.  Could you see just  walking into the office,  how you doing, Bob?  Right.  Hey, Tom, how you been?  And you have like  the Hitler mustache.  I'm going for a new look  here today.  You're automatically labeled  an anti-Semite.  Yeah, you would be like  Hitler.  But what if you just 
[00:57:30]  wanted to wear the mustache  because you look good?  You just want to  bring that look back.  Bastard wrecked it  for everyone.  Maybe we ought to  try to bring that back.  Oh, yeah.  Are you willing to  grow the Hitler mustache?  No, no, no.  With me?  No, see.  Maybe I'll do it?  No.  Walk around with the Hitler.  You'd get looks instantly.  You wouldn't get  just looks.  You would get  just beat up.  Like if it wasn't  for Hitler,  you'd be walking  down the street  and maybe pass  dozens of people  in a day  with the Hitler mustache  look.  Just like, you know, 
[00:58:00]  when the derby hat  was hot.  Right.  Everyone you passed  had the derby hat on.  A little derby hat.  And who knows,  that might come back  someday.  There hasn't been  anything really  that has crushed  that look.  No.  But the Hitler mustache,  ooh, you know,  years later.  We should have  Psycho Mark  put the mustache on  and walk around  like Time Star.  Psycho Mark,  grow the Hitler mustache.  Can he grow a mustache?  I haven't looked at  his potential  for facial hair.  I don't know.  All right,  he can grow  the Hitler mustache  and then walk  around the city  and we can see 
[00:58:30]  the reactions  that people get.  Our phones  crashed out  again, Spaz?  God damn,  I would love that.  I would love  to see that.  I think we have  to update  our phone system.  We're starting  to get so many calls  we're blowing out  the system every day.  Again?  Yeah.  I mean,  you could still  call the show  but our communications  between us  and Spaz  has broken down  once again.  Jesus H.  Christ.  Oh,  we can't type  in the...  No,  it's okay.  Pamela,  you're next. 
[00:59:00]  Hi,  how are you doing?  Good.  Hello.  Hey,  I remember  a few months back  when you invited  Hillary to your show  and if you keep  on talking about her  like that,  calling her a weeble,  she's not going to come.  Well,  we don't really care  either way.  We don't care  if she comes  to the show?  No.  No,  we don't care.  I mean...  Like she would even  do this show.  Yeah,  the odds are  she's not going  to be on our show.  I'm hoping to get  Rudy on.  That would be great.  We'd have Rudy on tomorrow.  Okay,  call Rudy.  See if she'll come.  We had Mayor Koch 
[00:59:30]  on when we first  got here.  He wasn't very  thrilled with us.  I think you two  are not the real  broadcasters.  Right.  God,  shut up,  you fossil.  We had to cut  the interview short.  He wasn't into us at all.  You know,  he was cool  when he was mayor  and it carried over  for quite a few years  after he was mayor  but then I finally  realized the guy's  just a dick.  He's just like  an old,  crotchety  anus.  We were trying 
[01:00:00]  to have fun with him  and he just  wouldn't have it.  And he was on  the People's Court  show for a while,  you know?  And he's doing that  and it seemed  kind of cool.  Oh,  we'll have him on  and talk about it.  And he was just like,  Dave,  Dave,  Dave,  I was the mayor  of New York  during very  tough times.  Jesus.  But he wasn't  fun at all.  No.  Who came in after him?  Oh,  Dinkins,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a lot  better than Dinkins. 
[01:00:30]  The Dinkins years.  Thank God.  God damn,  this city was fun  back then.  Thank God  I was working  on my radio career  during the Dinkins years.  I was everywhere  but New York.  Oh,  you should have  been here.  I'd take the best  years to like  be in western New York  working on my radio  career.  No,  man.  You should have  been here  during the Dinkins years.  I was paying  attention.  God damn.  I was glad.  That was some  of the funny,  it was like  a bizarro world.  Yeah.  You know,  when everything's 
[01:01:00]  in reverse.  Sure.  That's how it was.  It was insane.  And then,  you know,  every day  I'd be in my truck  working and click  on WLIB,  the black station,  when Dinkins wins  and all,  they're having like  Mardi Gras parties  in that station  every day  that Dinkins is in.  A drug dealer  shoots a cop,  Dinkins goes to  the drug dealer's  hospital bed.  Jesus,  it was bizarro world.  You're right,  it was bizarro world.  It was bizarro world.  Holy mother of pearl. 
[01:01:30]  And then when he  lost the election  to Giuliani,  I'd turn on WLIB  and they're in mourning.  It's over,  my brothers and sisters.  Our reign is over.  It was good  while it lasted.  Yeah.  I want a recap.  They were freaking out.  But the Dinkins ears,  oh my God.  That's very funny.  Bob Grant on the radio  always banging heads  with him.  Dinkins,  Dinkins is a  washroom attendant.  He called him  a washroom attendant.  And when they were 
[01:02:00]  rioting with the Jews,  a bunch of savages.  God,  what a fun time.  Oh yeah.  Bob Grant.  Jonathan,  you're next on WNW.  Hey guys,  how are you?  All right.  Listen,  we don't want  totally on our show.  We don't want her.  Wait,  I like how you just said that.  Yeah.  I like how you just said  we don't want her  on our show.  You're right.  You guys are like 
[01:02:30]  the 11th man.  You know how they do that  at football stadiums  and stuff?  Your show too.  It's your show too.  It's your show too.  You're the 11th man.  Right.  And her issue  with the homeless.  Listen,  I live in Jersey  when I worked in New York,  high school in New York.  Yep.  Everywhere I went,  there was a bomb.  Yeah.  You go into an ATM machine,  they'll hold the doors  open you  and then they get  their hands out  waiting for you  for something at 20.  I know.  How stupor are they?  I don't want to see it.  I don't want to see it.  I don't want to smell it.  They don't know  what they're talking about. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I mean,  Rudy's done a great job  with that.  Cleaning up the streets.  Yeah, you guys,  as far as I'm concerned,  Rudy is a hero.  A couple years ago,  he went against  some Democrat.  Actually,  he was for a Democrat  and I thought  he was a hero for that.  He went against  his own party for that.  And I got a lot of  respect for the guy.  Right.  I think he's done  a real good job  for the city.  I'm not a New Yorker,  but I really respect the guy  and I like what he's done.  We want Rudy on this show.  We want Rudy.  We want Rudy.  I want Rudy on my show.  All right.  On my show.  Thank you, John. 
[01:03:30]  My pleasure.  Take care.  Bye.  You can't do something  for the good of your city  if you're the mayor like that,  like he is,  and make everyone happy.  You're going to piss off  a lot of people.  Me, personally,  I think he ought to  throw the cops some cash,  you know?  Of course.  The guy's been holding out  on the cops and,  you know,  the crime's down  and everything like that.  Wait,  is it Rudy out on the streets?  I'm patrolling  with my comb over.  It's not him.  The cops are out there.  With his Simon Barr sinister head. 
[01:04:00]  Simon Barr sinister.  I'll rule the city.  May crime drop  and close the booby bars.  Where's the Rudy rap?  We've got to play the Rudy rap.  Ask Baz.  He'll find it.  But you're going to  piss off a lot of people.  He pissed me off  with the closing up  the booby bars  and everything  and the peep shows.  Well,  that person earlier  made a good point.  He's not for nightlife,  basically.  Yeah.  He's not about fun.  He's not in it.  He's into bringing revenue  into the city.  Yeah.  And boy,  he's done that. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  And you could walk  down the streets,  you don't see as much  crap as you used to.  Not as much.  And you know something?  Quite frankly,  I don't care where it went.  You know,  a lot of people are like,  well,  where did they go?  Where did the homeless go?  I don't know.  Well,  there's a point  you've got to bring up,  too, though.  What?  The economy.  Yeah.  When the economy's good,  your city's in pretty good shape.  Because there's money  to pump in,  there's more jobs,  so everyone moves  up the ladder a notch.  Because everyone is bowing  to Clinton's presidency. 
[01:05:00]  The fact is,  I mean,  the economy's been  absolutely on a roll  since he's been in office.  And that helps  your stature.  Yes,  it does.  And does he have anything  to do with the economy?  No.  Alan Greenspan does.  Oh.  Isn't he going to talk  Monday or something?  Yeah,  there goes the stock market.  Yeah,  I don't know.  Something about interest rates.  Might raise him.  That is below.  John.  Yeah,  hey,  O.P. Anthony.  What's up?  How are you?  All right.  All right,  I have two things  I wanted to point out. 
[01:05:30]  First of all,  let him in.  It's horrible now.  He totally sucks.  Well,  we were disappointed  in his performance last night.  I hope he's not  in his office today  patting himself on the back  because he looked like  a puss.  You have his wig on,  you think,  or not?  He's got to reinvent himself,  I think.  What's up with that hair?  The hair?  Yeah.  He lost it.  He's losing it.  I know.  It happens to guys every day.  It's so bad now,  it looks like a rug  that is on his head  all the time.  Well,  they showed when  Pataki was on  a few years ago.  Not that long ago.  Yeah,  it was a few years ago. 
[01:06:00]  Like four years ago?  Yeah,  about that.  And he looked so much younger.  I mean,  that was a rough  four years for Dave.  Well,  he's got to grow  his hair out a little bit.  If you grow your hair out,  it kind of,  you know,  covers up some of that  space that's on your forehead.  It's too,  like,  cut close.  He just went for  the mighty fine there.  Exactly.  And the other thing  I wanted to touch on,  that girl that was  talking about the,  she worked on the girl.  The girl who was  the pizza delivery girl.  Yeah.  I have a funny story,  too,  about how people 
[01:06:30]  sue restaurants.  My cousin lives  down in Florida,  and he worked at  one of the,  like,  the Little Caesar  type places down there.  And what happened  was a couple of  yams came in  and started harassing  all the workers.  Oh, my God.  So they all went  in the back  and they pissed  in the pizza sauce.  And what they did  was the company  ended up getting sued  because somehow  they ended up  seeing these kids  in the back  pissing in the sauce.  Well, you can't,  you can't do that. 
[01:07:00]  Well, they went  and harassed  all the workers  and they ended up  peeing in their pizza.  Right.  Oh, all right, man.  And the company  got sued.  There you go.  Thank you, John.  No problem.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got to re,  uh, reboot the phones,  get them working right.  All right.  As we go to break,  it's the Rooney Wrap.  We haven't played  this in a while.  No.  Check it out.  Let me taste it.  Yeah, you taste that,  biatch.  Hmm.  Let me taste it.  I'm a bad mother f***er. 
[01:07:30]  Lord Como.  Let me taste it.  Mm-hmm.  The price is me.  That's right.  I'm Rudy G.  I'm here to save.  My hair looks like  a roadkill toupee.  I'm the number one man  in NYC.  So why are all the  homeboy so pissed at me?  I'm the R's to the U  to the D to the Y.  A bad mother f***er  makes a food vendor cry.  Mm-hmm.  Get the carts off the streets,  you goddamn immigrants.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm a bad mother f***er. 
[01:08:00]  Close the strip clubs  and porno stores.  I don't care.  The cops bring my whores.  Take on Al and Farrakhan.  I'm plenty f***ing tough  for a skinny white man.  So squeegee guy  trying to turn a buck.  Get yourself a job,  you lazy f***er.  Yeah, I'm the mayor man.  I'm number one.  I got a frigid wife  and a big fat son.  Don't give me no s***  about Hillary.  That fat-ass bitch  ain't no better than me.  I can't bother  with the homeless and sick. 
[01:08:30]  All the motherf***ers  can suck my d***.  I'm Rudy G.  Yeah, I'm Rudy G,  motherf***er.  The Lisbon Mayor,  Rudy G,  Lord Comeover  to the motherf***ers  in the hayo.  Word.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Grown men jumping  all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1-0-2-7-7-7-U-N-E-W. 
[01:09:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sam's on the phone here.  Sam, what's up?  Sam, that's all right.  Ah, well,  he has Sam down,  sorry.  Yeah, well,  it's bad,  but it's bad.  Anthony,  I'm only 21,  but you got me nostalgic  talking about  the Dinkins Hour, man.  Yeah.  How crazy was New York  back then?  It was insane.  Things are so much more interesting.  It was so much fun  to pick up the daily news  and the post  on a daily basis. 
[01:09:30]  Do you remember  how the cops  used to have  those demonstrations  against Dinkins  and Giuliani  would be there with them?  Yeah.  Bunch of drunk cops  who live in Nassau,  can I?  They leave our cops alone.  It was so much fun back then.  Times Square  was so much more sleazier  back then.  You had the dirty old men  on the corner  and no more peep shows.  Things aren't interesting anymore.  Well, when you used to drive in  with, like,  your parents and stuff,  your parents would be  all embarrassed  because you'd just be passing,  you know,  big movie theater  marquees saying,  suck sluts  and come in for,  you know, 
[01:10:00]  dancing girls  will do this  and it's all just  spelt down on the street.  Everybody had the pimps  on the sidewalks  with the random quarters.  Yeah, the random acts  of violence every day,  gunshots,  crack dealers.  Yeah.  You drive by the Javits Center,  it was just whores,  whores, whores  everywhere.  You don't have those  open air drug markets  anymore, man.  It's so much harder  to get a piece of crack rock  these days.  Yeah.  It's like a different city.  It was so much fun.  It was very entertaining  back then.  I'll tell you that much.  It was an adventure  coming into Manhattan.  They didn't know 
[01:10:30]  if you were leaving.  The only thing  that Giuliani and Dinkins  have in common  is Koch hates both of them.  He used to bash  Dinkins,  now he bashes Giuliani.  I hate all of them.  Oops, my ticker's  going again.  How am I doing?  All right, Sam.  Yeah, those were  some fun times  in Dinkins' years.  Sam remembers.  It was nice to check  that out from afar, Ant.  Yeah.  I was missing in action 
[01:11:00]  those years.  Just what an embarrassment,  I think.  The first black mayor  of New York City.  An achievement for blacks.  I mean, an achievement.  It's the biggest city  in the world,  the pinnacle of the free world.  I mean, we're right here,  New York City.  Black mayor.  And he completely  dropped the ball.  I mean, completely  dropped the ball.  He had Clinton-itis.  If the polls weren't up,  he was pissed  and trying to figure out  a way to change him around. 
[01:11:30]  Rudy doesn't care.  He'll have an idea.  No matter how twisted  or ass backwards it is,  he has it,  he's committed to it,  and he'll do it.  He follows it through.  Regardless of who calls  him an ass for doing it,  who hates him for doing it,  doesn't matter.  I'm following through.  Close shot,  movie pie.  Yeah.  You know,  he pisses people off,  but he does it.  Dinkins is like,  uh-oh,  now what?  Oh,  oh no,  the polls are down.  What do I do?  Oh,  I'll go to the drug dealer's bed.  Oh,  my community's all pissed at me  because a cop shot a drug dealer  and the cop is dead. 
[01:12:00]  The drug dealer's still alive.  Oh,  I better go to the drug dealer's bedside  for Reverend Al  and meet with his family.  It was like a wacky sitcom.  It was.  It was Bizarro World  where everything was backwards.  Remember that?  Superman?  It's good times with Dinkins.  It was crazy,  but damn interesting.  The whole Tawana Brawley thing  was going on,  wasn't it,  during the Dinkins years too?  Where you just see Reverend Al  every two seconds,  Tawana Brawley.  Wiping your fall. 
[01:12:30]  Tawana Brawley.  She went fine with excrement on her  and Rachel Lampersuits  written all over her body.  David Diggins,  I want an investigation  about Tawana Brawley.  Steven Pagonis  and a bunch of police officers  gang banged Tawana Brawley  and wrote the word nigga on her  and spread excrement on her  and threw in a plastic garbage bag.  You didn't check out the stories 
[01:13:00]  from the neighbor  who saw Tawana crawling  into a garbage bag herself.  I don't hear that.  Dinkins is in the background  just nodding his head.  Yeah, we're looking into it.  If the polls say  I should look into it,  I'll look into it.  What a cluster F that was.  C. Vernon Mason,  Alton Maddox,  and Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Larry, Moe, and Curly  of the black community.  Those are some fun times, man. 
[01:13:30]  Hallelujah.  Good times.  I am Al Reeves.  Tawana.  And remember the news clip  of Tawana Brawley?  Reverend Al figures  it's good to get loose.  Tawana was being quiet  the whole time.  Figures they're finally  going to let Tawana  make a statement  because Reverend Al,  Maddox, and Mason  are catching so much heat  that Tawana will make a statement.  Her statement,  no one manipulates me  or my family. 
[01:14:00]  That's right.  You know how it came out?  No one nip-snapes me  or my, I swear to Christ,  it came out,  no one nip-snapes me  or my family.  Get the tape.  I was on the floor  wetting myself.  I swear to God,  I wet myself.  I was laughing so hard.  You were sucking on your thumb,  you were laughing so hard.  They finally let her  make a statement.  Nip-snapes.  Nip-snapes.  God damn, bring me back.  That was fun.  Kids, don't forget,  later on,  what did we learn 
[01:14:30]  on the show today?  We learned how to say nip-snapes.  But man,  those were the days.  Wow, very good.  Let's go to Dan real fast.  Dan, you're on WNAW.  He was.  Dan waited all that time,  hangs up on the air.  Okay, Brian, what's up?  Hey, hello, how are they?  What's up?  Yeah, I was in detention yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I was listening  to you guys like...  So were we after the show.  We were in detention.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, and I was in there  listening to my radio  without, like,  the teacher looking at me  with my hood on,  and I started dying.  I was, like,  kicking the table.  I was dying,  listening to the show  when the guy was out there  screaming around,  show us your fun bags.  Psycho Mark.  Oh, my God.  Show us your fun bags.  We created a star yesterday.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, and now I have  two weeks more detention  because I was smoking.  Oh, well.  It was worth it, right?  Yeah, hell yeah.  You guys are awesome.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Bye. 
[01:15:30]  Kim says her parents say  nips nates all the time.  Kim.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, man?  I was going to school  up in New Paltz  when that whole thing happened.  And it was just outrageous, you know?  There was just racial fights  and everything.  And the first time  she ever made that statement,  we laughed so hard.  It could be the funniest thing  I've ever heard on the news.  No one nips nates me  on the family.  My mother, my sister,  and I still say that  ten years later.  Really?  It is just,  I will never forget it. 
[01:16:00]  Anytime I hear the word  manipulates,  I always think nips nates.  No one nips nates me  on the family.  One night,  my sister and I  were out at a bar  and some guy  was giving me a hard time.  Yeah.  She got in his face  and she's about five foot,  about a hundred pounds.  She got in his face  and said,  no one nips nates me  on the family.  It's too much.  I can't believe  you guys remember that.  You guys rock.  No, it's better than I  because I don't remember that.  That was a highlight  of the Tawana Brawley incident.  Now, I need to find 
[01:16:30]  the footage of that.  The Wapingham Falls  teen Tawana Brawley.  I'm telling you.  And then, like, you know,  when they had the guy,  Pagonis,  just up on, you know,  out just before  and they had Tawana out,  soon as I saw her,  that's the first thing  I thought of.  I'm so glad  somebody else remembers that.  I'm sure a lot of New Yorkers  remember that one, man.  That was too damn funny.  You guys suck.  Take care.  All right.  Thank you, Kim.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  David, you're next  on the program.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, you know,  this whole Tawana thing,  I seem to remember  Bill Catterby being involved 
[01:17:00]  in this whole thing, too.  Didn't he donate a lot of money  to handle her legal charges  and stuff?  Yeah, a lot of people,  a lot of blacks  came to the table for her  until they realized,  oh, my God,  this is a sham.  And it's...  Walk the other way.  It's being handled  by just three kooks.  Alton Mason,  Mason and Maddox  in that friggin' Al Sharpton.  Absolutely.  And that was the good old days  of Al Sharpton  when he used to wear  the sweats  and the big Volkswagen  hubcap medallion 
[01:17:30]  around his chest.  Well, he had to be in there  with the people,  you understand.  I'm with my peeps.  It was the mod squad.  The mod squad.  Look at me.  I look dapper  in my sweatpants  and my big Volkswagen  hubcap medallion.  Thank God I was wearing it  when that racist  went to stab me that day.  Remember that?  And Reverend Al  got stabbed?  Those were some great times.  Yeah, but then they went  to the bedside  of the guy  who stabbed him,  I think, didn't they?  Yeah.  I'll go to your bedside.  And listen, 
[01:18:00]  you guys have got to  time some of this stuff.  You're going to pull it  on television  with some of those  fucking traffic jams.  We don't know  when the hell  that stuff happens, man.  The next one for Psycho Mark,  we've got a couple  things in the works.  One we can't even mention.  Well, let's see  what's your eyes open.  It may happen next week  and then hopefully  the Today Show  in the near future.  I'm just going to have  to start leaving work  earlier, I guess.  All right, David.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  And after that wrap,  now we've got to play  the Reverend Al song.  Ah, yes.  And we'll be back.  Who comes running 
[01:18:30]  when the cops  get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's  in the cool clubs clan?  Yelling and a-screaming  as he's speaking  to a mob.  He wears expensive suits,  but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's no pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing  off the people  leave his own community.  Why is the white man  always picking on me? 
[01:19:00]  He's got a fat belly  and his head's full of grease.  He can hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan  who you know you can trust.  The porky little reverend  with an ass just like a bus.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown  with too many calories.  Now why is the white man  always picking on me? 
[01:19:30]  Then the bird he gets  in the brawly case.  Turn on the TV,  you would always see his face.  He's speeding in his limo  to another homicide  to make the network news  with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  All the never-ending  toys for something  from Mr. T.  Why is the white man  always picking on me? 
[01:20:00]  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's on his ground.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family  and he doesn't charge a fee.  Not as long as the footage  makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's the raised faith  and white  and the bag of Bologna.  Now why is the white man 
[01:20:30]  always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Open me at that.  We got Channel 2 news on.  Got a megaphone  and something to say.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  Causing trouble 
[01:21:00]  on CBS 2.  The hugest wow sign.  Monty Kramer  is a tight-ass crew.  This is like, you know,  I can see big  like Omar.  He's a freak.  There he is.  That's a huge draw sign.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  What happened, Mark? 
[01:21:30]  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS guy just left the body.  You look like a sock-raving lunatic.  That was classic.  You Mark can't be doing that.  What the hell are you boys  just you're interrupting  our own news broadcast?  God dang.  You know we're going to get  in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know.  Take your mind.  Use a freak.  Chance, whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out. 
[01:22:00]  Whip them out.  Why don't you say  she's very mad at me.  You tell her  go to our boss.  No, I'm not.  I'm just, I'm hanging out.  You should be allowed  to do your job.  I should be allowed  to do my job.  I almost pissed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing  I've seen in a very,  very long time.  Mark, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around  with that set, you guys?  What do you like?  Walk around like John Wayne?  Wayne, Mike?  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  I just want to know, guys,  when is the farewell show  going to be?  That's why you're going  to listen every day.  This could be it  right here today.  You never know.  I'm all for violence  sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys  are a bunch of putts.  God, I want to punch you  in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  We're back on the  Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEWR.  Phone line  212-757-1027. 
[01:23:00]  Our listeners are on  to us, Anthony.  What?  Greg on the instant feedback  from Jersey.  We just took a musical break,  what, about 10 minutes ago?  Yeah.  A musical break  to regroup.  Who are you guys kidding?  The market's closed  and you want to  check your stock.  And who were we  on the phone with  during the break?  We called up.  Our old buddy,  Stockbroker Dave.  Stockbroker Dave  finally checking in.  We've got to have him  in here again.  Well, he's done a lot  for the show.  Good friend of the show. 
[01:23:30]  He should call back  so we can talk about stocks  because he told us  some stuff off,  you know,  I don't know  how much of it  we can repeat.  Well, it doesn't matter  if he says it,  you know,  he's just on the,  I don't know.  Well, that's why  I don't want to say anything.  I mean, not like  he's doing anything illegal,  but there's all sorts  of rules between  the stock market  and broadcasting  and all that crap,  so we don't know.  You can't go on the air,  I'm sure,  and puff up a stock  you're holding.  No.  You know?  People are getting  in trouble with websites.  Like, there's message boards 
[01:24:00]  and all kinds of  bulletin boards  for every stock out there.  You go on to, like,  the CNBC site  and you could get  a message board  for any company.  There are people  that just buy  a crap load  of these $5 stocks,  just load up on them,  then go on the message boards  and put a link there  to a page  that looks like  a legitimate  brokerage firm page,  and then they  trash the stock,  just trash it, 
[01:24:30]  and people sell it.  They sell off.  Or they talk it up  and they buy  the crap out of it  and then the people  that own it,  that own the site,  sell it at a profit.  That's brilliant.  And they're getting  in, like,  huge trouble.  You can't do that.  That's brilliant, though.  You get screwed for that.  Now, the phones  are busted again.  Again?  Why does it happen?  They work fine  during the songs  and spots.  I think it's good news,  though, for the show.  It just means the show's growing  and we're blowing out  the phones now. 
[01:25:00]  It's Y2K, Opie.  Yeah, sure.  You see me with my computer  in the back office there?  I see that.  I ran to a CompUSA.  What did I get?  Video card  and some memory.  I'm playing Half-Life  on a 12-inch monitor.  Jesus Christ.  Opie's checking mail  on, like,  a 19-inch  beautiful monitor.  My system that I use  is a monster.  Yeah.  And all I'm doing  is checking message boards  and answering  all our listeners back.  I got my chitty-chitty 
[01:25:30]  bang-bang computer  over there  like smoke  is coming out of it.  I'm kicking it  to get the CD-ROM  door to open up.  There's smoke,  I swear,  coming out of it.  It's making noises.  You've got to climb  to the top of this building  and crank it up  a little bit  so you can get  another 10 minutes  of Half-Life.  I do.  I've got to put  green in it  because the squirrel  that's running in the cage  has to run faster  inside the computer.  It's an old  Packard Bell  piece of crap  before I learned  Dell  is the way to go.  But,  yeah,  I put a video card in 
[01:26:00]  and some memory.  Oh,  and it looks great  on the postage stamp monitor.  So I know  what's going to happen next.  I need a monitor.  Time for Ann  to get another monitor.  God's sake.  How much money  have you spent  on computer equipment  in the last year?  In the last year.  A few grand there.  Easily, right?  It's got to be,  yeah,  like what,  four maybe?  Probably four.  I love technology.  I love computers.  I've got to have everything.  That's it.  Tony,  you're a cop.  Hope's working on the show.  I've got the side  of my computer open. 
[01:26:30]  I'm pulling boards out.  It's like,  what the hell  are you doing?  I've got to put this in now.  I don't give a crap  as long as you're funny  between two and seven.  Who cares what you do, man?  Pull out all the boards  you want.  Tony,  you're next on the radio show.  What do you have?  Hey,  how's it going?  Well, yeah,  I heard you guys  talking about  knocking Hillary.  I'm not going to vote for her.  She's not my cup of tea  or anything like that.  But you've got to  knock Giuliani, too.  You guys said it.  He doesn't pay the cops  enough money. 
[01:27:00]  I'm a Port Authority cop.  Well,  all you guys  are going to vote  for Giuliani  just to get him  out of the city out here.  Yeah,  well,  we just want him  to get out,  period.  You've got your  Port Authority.  Are you even  under Giuliani?  No,  no,  no.  Our boss  is the governor.  Yeah,  you guys are different.  Yeah,  we're governed  actually by  Pataki  and Whitman.  Yeah.  He's our boss.  We don't work  for Giuliani,  but he hates us.  He hates  anything having  to do with 
[01:27:30]  Port Authority.  What's that?  He hates  anything having  to do with  Port Authority,  Giuliani.  Big time.  I want control  of the airports.  He does.  He wants the airports  and it's all  Port Authority.  No,  you know what  he's like to me?  He reminds me  of when you watch  pro wrestling.  He's like that  wrestler that was  a good guy,  then he turned  to be a bad guy.  You don't see  that chair  coming behind  your back  and blindside you.  That's how he is.  I mean,  during the Dinkins era,  he was out there  protesting with the cops  and this and that, 
[01:28:00]  and then he came there.  He totally turned  his back on everybody.  Yeah,  he should take  better care of the cops.  That's obvious,  I mean,  for what they've done  for the city.  And he's taken  a hell of a lot  of credit for it.  I mean,  he can't do a speech  about the job  he's done  without bringing up  how much crime  has dropped  and how safer  the streets are.  Well,  who's doing that,  Rudy?  Toss him a dime  or two,  you know?  I mean,  I'm telling you,  if you had him up there,  if you've got him  on your show  and you ask him, 
[01:28:30]  you say,  well,  you know,  what do you think  of these Port Authority cops?  He'll start backtracking  like you wouldn't believe.  I'm pretty sure of it.  I think it's time  to have the mayor  on our show.  I'm serious.  Well,  he does broadcast  on CBS.  You know,  I mean,  I would love  if you guys had him on.  Ask the mayor.  Ask the mayor.  We'll do it.  Goddamn,  that show is great.  We'll do  Ask the mayor  on our show.  Ask the mayor.  I mean,  really,  I would love  to have him on.  Like,  if you guys had him on,  I would love  to be on the phone  talking to him.  Hey, man,  what do you think?  Well,  you guys would ask  most of the questions.  What the hell?  You know? 
[01:29:00]  What are we going to ask him?  I would get like  Kinnison on him,  you know?  I would be like,  say it,  say it.  What do you think  of the Port Authority?  Say it.  He's made no bones about it.  He can't stand  the Port Authority cops.  You know?  I mean,  we can't stand him.  Screw it.  Yeah.  All right,  Tony.  All right.  Thanks a lot,  guys.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  All right.  Phones are busted,  so now we just  got to randomly go to him.  This is good.  Uh-oh.  Who's this?  It's me.  How are you?  Hi, Steve.  What do you have?  You know,  you guys were talking  about computer monitors.  I had a monitor  that was like  since like 1990,  and that sucker  was trying hard 
[01:29:30]  to stay alive,  and then it just  burst into sparks.  Monochrome.  Nothing better than that.  It blinked out on me,  and like I had to  go back and rush like  crazy to keep myself calm  and unplug everything  so I wouldn't like  spark out myself.  The thing was smoldering  as I took it outside.  That's great.  There's nothing better  than something bursting  into flames in your house.  It makes you happy.  Yeah.  Now you got to get a new one.  I already bought it  the same day,  but I went to a place  where the guy  barely spoke English  and tried to sell me  like a $225 monitor  for like, you know.  It was insane. 
[01:30:00]  So I just went  all around the place.  I got a really good  17-inch monitor.  Very good.  I'll check it.  I'll download all the stuff  and go to the site.  Where did you try  to get the monitor?  On like Broadway?  No, actually.  Where they sell all that crap,  you know,  10,000 times the actual worth?  Binoculars, my friend.  Binoculars.  These are $100 binoculars.  And they're like  the little things  you get out  of the gumball machine.  $100 coated  lenses coated  with white.  Get out of here.  The prices,  they just,  they just rake you  over the cold. 
[01:30:30]  It's like,  wait a minute,  what happened  to the price  from the time  I looked at it  in the window  in front of the place  and I walked in  to buy it?  Walkman, $5.  Walk in, $500.  $500.  You did not see decimal.  You can borrow  with those guys  pretty good.  And you're still  going away  getting ripped off.  You're going to get ripped off.  It doesn't matter.  Because you bought  those binoculars  when we first moved  back to New York  because we had  to check out  all the chicks  across the way  from our hotel.  Yeah,  they put us up  in a hotel.  It was right  across from  an apartment building.  We needed binoculars.  We're in New York. 
[01:31:00]  Broadway is the only place  where we could get binoculars.  So we're walking around.  I walk in.  You get these  little phantom binoculars,  little ones.  The guy wanted  $90 for him.  $90 for binoculars.  You get it  molded.  Gotta go to mold.  You get it  like,  it's like $5.  Cheap open  binoculars.  I'm like,  get out of here.  I go to walk out.  My friend,  my friend.  All of a sudden,  I'm a friend.  My friend.  We can work it up.  My friend,  how much do you want  to pay?  You want to pay  like $10,  I'll give you. 
[01:31:30]  On $20.  Now I'm thinking,  all right,  he went from $90 to $20.  This is crap.  He's still making a profit.  He's not going to go,  okay,  I'm going to give him  at a price  where I'm going to lose $50.  No,  he's still making a profit.  And you ended up  buying him for like $20  and he was pissed off  that he was giving it  to you at that price.  He was pissed.  So I said $10  and then he said $20.  I said $15.  He said $18.  And then I was sticking,  at that point,  I could care less  about the binoculars.  Then I was sticking at $15.  I said,  no,  $15.  $18.  $15.  $17. 
[01:32:00]  $50.  $50.  I'm like we're in Bangladesh  over here arguing  over a pig head.  $15.  $18.  I said,  no,  $15.  Sorry,  my friend.  Okay,  bye.  See ya.  My friend,  my friend,  $15.  All right,  my friend.  He's my pal now,  my friend.  You're a buddy,  your pal.  I don't even know  who this is.  Who are you?  Yeah,  Mike.  Hey,  Mike.  Yeah,  I'm a cop in the city.  Hey,  Mike,  good.  Yeah,  how you guys doing?  I don't know why  you guys support us  all the time.  We try.  Yeah,  a lot of guys 
[01:32:30]  should vote for Giuliani  to get him into Congress  because if not,  the next election  is going to be  him being for governor.  Then he's really  going to hammer us.  Well,  yeah,  he's done as mayor anyway.  I mean,  he can't run  for another term,  so.  Yeah,  no,  but if he stays  in New York  and he goes back  as governor,  he's really going to  hurt us.  And to tell you the truth,  he'll probably make  a good senator  for New York  because he's  very pro-New York.  He'll go to Washington  and try to get  as much money  as he can  for the state. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  But as far as  the city's concerned,  you've got to get  a mayor who's  a little more  sympathetic  with the cops  in there.  Yeah,  we hope so.  You know what you guys  said?  Yesterday,  you were talking  about the goat's head  bar down at  Hotspoint.  Yeah.  And don't get me wrong,  I do think  some of you cops 
[01:33:30]  are real pricks.  Well,  you come across  a few that are  real hard asses,  you know.  For the most part,  they're pretty cool.  But some of you,  oh my God.  Hey,  who's this?  ONA.  Yeah,  what's your name,  man?  What's up?  It's Craig.  I'm a cop in the Bronx.  What's going on?  Cool, Craig.  Listen,  I don't know  what's worse,  him or Hillary.  It's like a decision.  My gun is going  to jump off the building.  I want to see  either one of them  get in.  It looks like  that's going to be  the...  He's taking us  around left and right,  not giving us 
[01:34:00]  the money we deserve.  But he has nothing  to do with it  after he's gone,  so you might want  to vote him...  Yeah,  just to get him  the hell out of the city,  I hear you on that one.  He's out anyway,  but like you said,  hopefully he won't  try to run for governor.  I don't know  if he'd get that,  though.  I don't know  about that either.  And I wanted to...  I tried yesterday  about the strippers.  Yeah.  Listen,  I was up in  Sue's Rendezvous  one night  in Mount Vernon.  Great hangout,  right?  Hello?  Yeah,  listening to you again.  I thought you guys  caught me off.  Oh, no.  I'm in there one night,  me and my friend,  and this hot  Puerto Rican girl  gets on stage, 
[01:34:30]  starts dancing,  taking her dress off.  She's got this white  nice G-string on,  nice set of hooters  on her,  right?  She turns around,  she bends over,  nice big red streak  right down the middle  in the period.  It was disgusting.  Wow.  A little extra treat  for your buck.  Yeah.  No black dancers  from Otto.  All right,  you guys rule,  man.  Take care.  Later, man.  Later.  Bye.  Very funny.  Like Giuliani,  I think he would make  a good center.  He's very pro  in New York,  and mayor is the  kind of job,  especially in New York, 
[01:35:00]  it's very personal  for such a big city.  The mayor is very  involved with  the communities  and the people,  you know,  so when he makes  a decision,  it affects people  directly.  Senators are a little  more detached  from their constituency,  so I don't think  he'd be making  as many enemies  on a personal level  in the Senate.  And then you get  another mayor in there,  we'll see how  that works.  We don't even know  what the senators  do down in Washington  for us.  They'll hopefully  come back  with wheelbarrows  full of money  for the state. 
[01:35:30]  That's pretty much it.  We have no idea  what they do  on a day-to-day basis  or anything.  Oh, they get hummers  from pages.  There you go.  That's what I hear.  But everything  the mayor does,  we read about  in the local papers.  It's very hands-on,  very personal.  Sure.  He's right there  in the thick of it.  Senators,  I think they delegate  a lot of responsibility.  I think it's a lot  of schmoozing,  a lot more schmoozing  than it is actual  hands-on work.  And it's who you know  and you try to bring  back as much cash  to your state  as you can.  See, I just don't  trust Hillary. 
[01:36:00]  I don't think she would  have the best interests  of us,  the New Yorkers.  She could probably  get some cash back here,  but for what purpose?  I don't trust her,  though.  I think she's more  worried about her  own agenda.  True.  Yeah, just she wants  to be a senator  so she could be a senator.  With Rudy,  you know he probably  really wants the job  to have a legacy  for himself  to say,  look what I did  for New York  and after he leaves  his tenure  in civil service  he could look back  and go, 
[01:36:30]  all right,  people couldn't  stand me,  but look what I did  for the city  and the state.  Right.  Hillary,  on the other hand,  wants to go,  how did I look?  You know,  look,  I'm a senator.  You know,  look at my resume.  I think she's more  concerned with that.  Of course.  Yeah,  she wants to be  prez.  Please.  Oh my God.  She does, though.  She could probably  get a Hummer  in the Oval Office.  I wouldn't doubt  she's got something  swinging.  And it's just  coming down. 
[01:37:00]  Oh,  there go the phones again.  You know,  we haven't pitched  in a while,  but it happens.  I know,  help us out.  It's Y2K.  Help us out, people.  We can't do a talk show  if we don't have phones.  We need that connection  with our listeners.  Yeah,  please don't make us talk.  So much easier  when the listeners  do the show for us.  Isn't it?  It's great.  We've got the biggest  scam going in radio.  Hey,  Opie,  Anthony,  you're great.  Well,  have you been listening?  We haven't said anything.  Ixnay on the AMSCA.  Right. 
[01:37:30]  Biggest freaking scam going.  They're just not  on to us yet.  Great.  Take another call.  I'm trading options.  Right.  Right.  Half the time,  our listeners are talking.  They'll go on.  When they're going on  for three or four minutes,  it's not because we're listening.  We're distracted  with something  on our laptops here.  When you hear a caller  and they're talking  and then they pause  and go,  hello?  Because we're not saying  like,  uh-huh,  yeah?  Yeah.  We're doing something else. 
[01:38:00]  We're not listening.  And then we've quickly gone,  no,  we're listening to your story.  A little insight  on the show.  Wow,  those guys are good listeners.  Yeah.  No,  we're not.  They really pay attention.  Oh,  my God.  63 and three quarters.  Sell.  That's funny.  Well,  and it's coming down.  Puff Daddy  has been  indicted  on weapons charges. 
[01:38:30]  Oh,  no,  say it's not so.  Weapons charges?  Now he's got  Johnny Cochran.  Yeah.  His own dream team.  They always talk  about the dream team.  It's only Cochran.  And then this other guy,  Benjamin Brathman?  Yeah.  Because they've got  to have the white guy.  Any black guy  that gets in trouble,  they get Johnny Cochran,  but then you need  the obligatory white guy.  Usually it's that  little wormy DNA guy.  Dershowitz?  No,  not Dershowitz. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah,  yeah.  Sheck.  Barry Sheck.  Barry Sheck.  Barry Sheck.  Boy,  his hair doesn't look  too greasy.  It's like he's got  DNA in his hair.  Did that guy shower  once during the OJ trial?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah,  but he's got the,  he's got the Oreo team,  the black and white,  and Johnny Cochran  right there.  That's got to cost  a buck,  huh?  He's got the money,  though.  Not for long,  though.  He's heading down  the MC Hammer Road. 
[01:39:30]  Do you think so?  Wickley.  Yeah,  that's true.  He better watch that  E,  true Hollywood story  on MC Hammer.  He should have  gotten the music  and watch it every day  in his limo  because he's heading  that way.  I mean,  his latest album  isn't doing as well  as they thought.  Can't touch this.  Now he's in trouble.  He's going to have to  pay a fortune  to Johnny Cochran  and his rhyming.  Down,  down,  down,  down,  down,  down,  down,  down,  down,  can't afford this,  down,  down,  down,  down,  down.  He bought a $10 million  house.  Yeah.  And then he had  his posse  just drain him 
[01:40:00]  like so many leeches.  MC Hammer,  yeah.  MC Hammer.  And now Puffy,  you're right,  he's running down  the same road.  You know,  the last album  he put out  didn't sell as good,  did it?  He's got to look out.  He should be  watching his cash.  It's out now.  All right,  so we're looking forward  to the Johnny Cochran  rhymes.  Although I didn't say  that,  I hope he did,  Puffy.  because he's been  known to break  into places  and just have  people beat  the crap out  of people  that bad mouth him.  All right,  we've got to play  a little ditty  from Airsick Productions. 
[01:40:30]  Airsick.net  if you want to  check out any  of their stuff.  They've got a little  Puffy and Jennifer  song here  on the Opie and Anthony  show,  WNW.  I'm a movie queen  in the hip-hop scene  Me and Puffy  together 
[01:41:00]  Didn't think you were dumb  till you had a gun  They threw both of us  in a slammer  And now I hear that  you're dissing me  A pistol  I'm pissed off  What is my defense?  You think I'd turn on  You cut myself a deal  And turnstates  they ever dance  Busted for the night  Oh  When even though 
[01:41:30]  I was in harm  Busted for the night  Oh  Now Puffy thinks  I'll do him harm  Busted for the night  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Fran is 84 years old  Rick, you cannot have  oral sex with Fran  I'm sorry  No anal is okay  Trainwrecked radio  The Opie and Anthony show 
[01:42:00]  1027 WNW  1027 WNW  The rock of New York  That's what we used to say  right, Anthony?  Oh yeah  I forgot  I didn't even  bat an eye when you said it  I'll be honest  That was a slip  The rock of New York  This place has been  so many things  I'm surprised we don't  slip more often  Love songs  Nothing but love songs  Classic rock  with classic jocks 
[01:42:30]  Okay  Oh  What are we now?  Hey, we got it  I got it here  We got to do our  monthly tribute to  Scottsdale  Oh  Salomeo  Don't get confused  Oh, shoot  You know what  You talked over the best part 
[01:43:00]  I'm sorry  I'm hoping that to play it again  Hell yeah  Hold on  Hold on  Oh  Salomeo  I love that guy  Nothing funnier than an old man  just like  Oh  Alright  Scottsdale 
[01:43:30]  Make no mistake about it  We love that guy  Scottsdale  One of the only guys  that was cool to us  And Scottsdale  proved himself to be  a survivor  He's still on the airwaves  in New York  God, you guys think  we're lazy on our radio show  I would like to have his gig  Wow  He does one hour  One hour a day  Tune into the Scottsdale show  tomorrow  for our Beatles block  and some ELO  That's all we got time for 
[01:44:00]  and then Friday  for British biscuits  and  oops  that's all we got time for  Yeah  Not even a big biscuit  a little one  I mean  we're supposed to do  five hours  I mean  we usually do what  four hours and twenty minutes  so that's not too bad  He does an hour  Yeah  And it's  pre-recorded  Yeah  Oh well  Yeah  because  like if  there was a nuclear war 
[01:44:30]  happening  all of a sudden  one launched against  our country  New York  in flames  You'd hear Scottsdale going  and now it's  Fleetwood Mac  Because it was recording  You wouldn't know  The next day  it would be like  holy Jiminy Cricket  It's a nuclear weapon  I want that gig  You think we'll ever last  long enough to have  the one hour gig  Hell no  What are you kidding  You gotta work what  like 50 years 
[01:45:00]  to get the one hour gig  Dude  He is at least  still on  New York radio  Yeah  We will probably  be relegated to  CB Channel 4  I think  I don't care  Just be booted  out of everything  Breaker breaker  it's the O&A show  We're bitter and miserable  and hate each other  We have alienated  half the business  so far  Yeah  50% of the stations  out there will not  hire us  I know  Isn't that  That's scary  That sucks  And God forbid  we get fired from here  then it's pretty much 
[01:45:30]  down to maybe  like 5% of the business  will still hire us  Yeah  We're doing farm reports  in Nebraska  That's how consolidated  this business is getting  though  In the old days  you get fired  you piss off  one station  one company  Nowadays  you get fired  you piss off  half the business  Yeah  And it was like  it was strange  because in the old days  if you got fired  it wasn't out of the ordinary  to bring a lawsuit  against your old company  Yeah  It's like silly  to do that now  Oh my God  Especially since 
[01:46:00]  you know  it's like  Megacorp  We own everything  It's like  where are you going to go  Yeah  CB Channel 14  There you go  That's it  Or internet radio  The Radio Shack  Radio Shack  I'm in radio  Radio Shack  Work down at the store  Peter  How you doing  Alright  I don't know how  Puff Daddy got caught  with that gun  Huh  I don't know how  he got caught  with that gun  Why didn't he just  shove it up  Jennifer Lopez's butt  They never would have  found it  Really right  Well that's why

[01:47:00]  If I could field  this one  I will take this  You know why  we don't support  You know why  we don't support you  Why  We get so many calls  from the prisoners  and from the sound  of the background  it doesn't sound  like you guys  are doing squat  These guys  are calling us up  they're all yelling  Kill Opi Anthony  Yeah kill him  Kill him  We got some calls  like that  In a prison  okay  Let's get this straight  City  The city  covers jails  The state  covers prisons 
[01:47:30]  What are you  State  I'm a state CO  Alright  I'm in a prison  Alright  Now  How can you get  say you get calls  from prisoners  That's impossible  In a state prison  The only way  you can get calls  from a prisoner  is if you're  on their  calling list  Now  what are you guys  on prisoners  calling lists  Yes  We must be  No you can't be  It's got to be approved  We've gotten some calls  from state prisons  Not state prisons  No way  What is Rikers  Rikers is a city jail

Everyone's out  for themselves  in this election  Not everyone  All you guys  Not everyone  But it'd be better  if he went to be 
[01:49:00]  a senator  because if he  becomes governor  forget about it  He won't be governor  He'll be  doing a great job  He'll be senator  and I think  he'll be a good  senator  and you've just  got to hope  that the mayor  that gets in  or anybody  involved with the city  has to hope  that the next mayor  that gets in here  is a good one  Well not for nothing  Ant  You could run  against Hillary  and get elected  Alright John  We've got someone  on line 11  that has a problem  with you  Alright who's that  Chris  Chris  Yeah O&A  Hey you're on  with John  What's up  Listen do me a favor

[02:26:30]  to be able  and not  even New  York  just like  any stadium  step in there  without getting  razzed  he's going to  have a nightmare  year  yeah  it'll be fun  to watch  it will be  diesel battery  day  I think  it's going  to be  12 volt  interstate  car battery  day  big 12 volt  truck batteries  flying out  get that  balloon launcher  that you see  at jones beach  the  frank  yo  what's up  listen dude  I was  I was  listening to  some of the  radio stations  this morning  and Shane 
[02:27:00]  McMahon  was on  he was  yeah  they had him  on for a little  bit  and  what station  had  you can't  curse  you can't  curse  don't say  the S word  I'm sorry  dude  what station  had Shane  on  KTU  oh  KTU  I don't know  the guys  in the truck  listen to it  I don't  listen to it  but I heard  him on  so I wanted  to call  and ask him  what happened  with the rock  the other day  with you guys  and they dumped  right out of it  they didn't want  to talk about it  what you were 
[02:27:30]  on the air  yeah man  I was on  for a few minutes  and then they  dumped right out  of it  and they said  they lost me  you know what's  weird  I'm going to lose  you guys  because I'm  on the calling  all right Frank  thank you  no problem  man  you know what's  weird  WWF hasn't  even called us  hasn't even given  us the courtesy  of a phone call  to discuss  what happened  last week  I'm feeling  a bit  jilted  by them  I mean  they're  obviously pissed  and they have  every right to be  I'm not going to lie  but we're also pissed  why  huh 
[02:28:00]  why  because they feel  like you know  that I don't know  why to be honest  they have no right  they have no right  to be pissed at us  but they are pissed  yeah they're pissed  we're pissed  we'll call up  and talk about it  like human beings  like civil humans  we could talk with them  we had a good  relationship with them  I don't think one  little episode  with the rock  is going to ruin  our relationship  I don't know  they you know  Rick before he went  on vacation  he put at least  four calls into  the head office 
[02:28:30]  no one will call us  back  after they wrote  about us in their  little magazine  and everything  at least we got  our article out  of the way  yeah  usually we screw  things up  before things  come out  and we wreck it  like our CD  and stuff  like everything  like everything  the January issue  of Raw Magazine  we're in it  but um  if you care  I want everybody  that goes to the  Royal Rumble  which is at the  Garden  live  pay per view  it's going to be  televised live  to bring  Opie and Anthony 
[02:29:00]  rock signs  use your own  imagination  but they should  just tear the rock  a new a-hole  how are you  how  hey  suck anymore  fat out of  your bologna  boobs  rock  things like that  he had liposuction  you know  he had man breasts  yeah  but  that's because  he's Samoan  Opie  you know how  all Samoans  have those  big man breasts  why  why  I thought  Shane would  like you know  be cool enough  to at least call us  I don't know  obviously there's a problem 
[02:29:30]  if Shane's going on  like KTU  and he's blowing us  off in the afternoon  maybe we're on the outs  we're obviously  on the outs  but obviously  give us the courtesy  of a call  is it like wrestling  though  that we're on the outs  or is it real life  I think it's real life  oh  I was hoping  it was just like wrestling  you think this is like  a four month bit  yeah we're enemies now  we're enemies  and then all of a sudden  they're going to call  and go  oh it's alright man  we'll help you out  we'll team up  with Triple H  I'm Opie and Anthony  you know  I haven't watched 
[02:30:00]  wrestling since that  really  yeah  I find it hard  to watch The Rock  because he's such  a douche bag  he's such a douche  man  he wrecked it  he wrecked it  yeah  we saw Superman  without his cape  and it wasn't fun  yeah  we saw the man  behind the curtain  so now it's like  whatever he says  like oh whatever  and he's such  a huge storyline now  like right after  he did that  he became like  the storyline  he's the head of  like all the wrestlers  got together  against Triple H 
[02:30:30]  and Stephanie  and named Rock  as their spokesman  so they all come out  go around the ring  and The Rock gets inside  and starts like  bashing Triple H  and Stephanie  and making demands  of his own  so I gotta sit down  I'm watching  I'm like oh  it's The Rock  The Croc  hey Ed  and if he was a chicken  he'd be The Cock  because he's like a male  you know  he'd be a rooster  hey Ed  AOL is doing well  after hours trading  hey were you listening to me  no not at all  I could care less  okay 
[02:31:00]  until someone gives me  an explanation  I could care less  oh my god  let me see what they're doing  wow  Mikey  you tool  shut up  what did you say  nothing  you know  I'm talking here  I know you're talking  and you're trading  just getting you back  from the other day  oh okay  Mike  what's up  what's going on guys  not much  cool  hey listen  there's about 46 of us  going to the Continental  Airline Arenas  on Sunday  to see the show  yeah 
[02:31:30]  the WF show  and my father's got this huge  huge Winnebago  so me and my brother  it's going to be a cool idea  since WWF is always talking  about who's screwing who  we're going to have a big banner  on the Winnebago  on the one side  saying  the Rock screwed  Opie and Anthony  we're going to be protesting  inside the arena  with signs  so it'll be pretty cool  if you guys check out  good  cool  we'll check it out  you know  we're going to have like a big  tailgating party  you guys are more than welcome  I'm sure a lot of your fans  will come out and support us  we had tickets for both events  not going  we had tickets to the grand opening  of the restaurant  not going  I mean it's pretty douche 
[02:32:00]  what these guys  what he did to you  you know  I don't know if it's the owners  or what  but I mean  well at least call us  and say hey  we hate you now  whatever  that's cool  screw that  I'm still going to the opening  screw them man  I'll rake them  for all the beer  and food  I can shove in me  what are you kidding  what is that anyway  19th  19th  I'm going man  a week from yesterday  come on  it's like  there aren't all dicks  we can hang out with the road dog  and talk about what a dick the rock is  if you guys think we're a restaurant  let us know 
[02:32:30]  we'll show up there with a winter bagel  alright  alright guys  be good  I'd go hang out with Chris Jericho  if he wasn't gay  you might like yo  just kidding  Y2K  just kidding  Y2KY  Mike you're next on WNW  what's up  how are you guys doing  good  I tried to watch Monday night  I couldn't watch either  ever since last week  rock comes on  I'm tuning out  I'm putting something else on 
[02:33:00]  yeah  really  yeah  well I did check out the WCW the other day  I'm not going to lie  did you see Superfly Jimmy Snuka  I called that  he's got to be 70  and he climbs to the top of the cage  to do his famous move  and they had Tito Santana  doing the flying burrito  and everything  yeah  and then George the Animal Steel  also came out  it was like  well now's the time  oh my god  now's the time for them  to do anything  eating the turnbuckles  and stuff  yeah  he had to eat a turnbuckle  doing that old gag  that old gag  but I agree with you guys 
[02:33:30]  it was like you guys  finally met Santa  and he found out  that he wasn't real  and I think that's why  you guys are so upset  about this  well maybe the Rock  is really pissed off  because his WWF IPO  that went off at $34 a share  is now $14.75  that's probably it  oops  you guys are great  oops  later  bye  maybe you should try  making more friends  when your stock  is slipping like that  Dave  yeah  hey  hey  what's up  how are you guys doing  good  yeah I was thinking  about bringing a sign  that says 
[02:34:00]  the Rock deserves  a rusty trombone  yeah whatever you want  to bring there  that would be cool  and then  the Rock screwed ONA  alright cool  alright man  take it easy  thank you  later  if the WWF  does indeed hate us now  call us up  and tell us  yeah we want to know  and we won't even talk  if you want to just  call us up  we get on the phone  and you can just say  you're right  we hate you now  and hang up  that's it  and then at least we know  hmm  the Rock's a pussy
