<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about unsanitary food vendors in New York City, escalating into broader complaints about government regulations, excessive toll surcharges (EasyPass), airline fees, and the actions of lame-duck politicians.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy, used highly offensive language to describe the observed poor hygiene.  Listener calls contributed anecdotes about similar experiences worldwide, from Mexico City to Iraq.  The segment included a brief mention of the movie *Precious* and a funny anecdote about Eric Stoltz in *Pulp Fiction*, and a listener story about an egregious MTA experience involving tolls and Trade Center debris.

The show then transitioned to a debate about African travel destinations, with differing opinions on the continent’s safety and appeal.  This led to a call from Frank from Jersey, recounting a rat-infested cheesesteak preparation incident.  Further discussion about a listener's planned trip to Cape Town, South Africa, devolved into crude, humorous descriptions of various parts of the country.

The majority of the next segment was dominated by "the 202 Fugitive," who claimed to be sending a person named Bobo to the studio with food and a cup of his semen for E-Rock to consume as humiliation.  The Fugitive, hinting at his identity (Woodside, Queens upbringing; Mets fan), claimed to have stolen $10,000 from Mel Carzistan (mispronounced repeatedly).  The hosts, increasingly skeptical, engaged in a series of calls with Bobo and the Fugitive, eventually claiming to have contacted the police due to concerns.  This segment featured Rich Vos as a guest in studio, and included discussions about the hosts' and Vos' gambling experiences and frustrations.  Jimmy Norton’s stand-up shows were also promoted.

The next segment featured Rich Vos and began with Jimmy recounting a drug-related anecdote.  The conversation then jumped to Rich Vos' upcoming comedy shows, the surprising nutritional content of movie popcorn, and the listener contest involving the fugitive.  A female guest engaged in flirtatious banter, while Jimmy discussed his mental health struggles.  Matt, another guest, discussed his weight loss.  The conversation included speculation about Craig Robinson’s acting career and Patrice O’Neal's career and struggles, including anecdotes about his interactions with Chris Rock and Spike Lee.  An unsuccessful game segment on favorite movie snacks ensued, involving highly inappropriate suggestions.  "The Virus," a recurring character, contributed inappropriate responses before angrily leaving.  Listener calls added more offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with discussion of the fugitive contest and Bobo’s involvement, revealed (on-air) by Kenny, a former detective.  The show announced Bobo’s full interrogation would play after the break and ended with several “Fuck You” calls.

The final segment focused on a prank involving Bobo, who was tricked into participating in a mock interrogation about the $10,000 theft from Mel Karmazin.  Kenny, the studio guest, participated in the interrogation, during which Bobo initially denied involvement but eventually confessed to the prank, orchestrated by Danny and Travis.  The prank involved Bobo using a fake fugitive voice and a consistent "Meet the Mets" ringtone. Bobo reluctantly admitted to being bisexual during the increasingly absurd interrogation.  The segment culminated in a mock arrest, with Bobo being “escorted” out of the studio by Kenny to meet “detectives.”  A call to Bobo's friend, Rob, who initially believed his guilt, added another layer to the humor.  The segment included discussions about the hosts’ perceived intelligence and the potential consequences for Bobo.  It concluded with Rich Vos again promoting his upcoming shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, genius.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of cash.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  But you know how depressing that has to be for a job?  Morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Take my microphone, Jimmy.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  Everyone grab a mic to their left and let's start broadcasting.  Take the mic and pass it on.  I was hoping that if I used Anthony's mic, his jokes would come out of my mouth.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh. 
[00:01:30]  We were just talking about the savages and the food carts around here in New York.  And the hours that I'm driving in, people aren't there yet.  They're just setting up their savage food carts.  They're these big stainless steel things and they sell donuts and fucking bagels and everything else out of them.  And I just see them there.  And you know, there's no sanitary condition.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  There's nowhere they can wash their hands and those fucking things or anything. 
[00:02:00]  And you see them just bare-handing these bagels and as quickly as they can, they open up this big tub of butter.  You don't know how long it's been in the fucking sun.  And then just thwock a big spoonful and smear it on, smack it shut, stack it up on those metal shelves that have been driving on the roads.  They wash them down a little bit.  Wash them down.  You know the asbestos from brake pads that are probably piled up on that fucking misophilioma fucking bagel. 
[00:02:30]  People love those cart guys.  I know.  With their hairy knuckles buttering your bagels.  Buttering your bagels.  They're picking their nose.  Preparing your hot dog.  Where is that fucker washing his hands?  You tell me.  I'm looking at a picture.  Dude, dude.  Where is he washing his hands?  In the cooler that they keep all the refreshments in.  Yeah, no shit.  In the steaming hot water that the hot dogs go in.  Yeah.  They do a little dip every once in a while.  The hot water he makes his fucking lentil soup from.  Yeah, but, uh, I don't know.  Sanitation.  What do you call it?  Sanitary conditions?  Yeah.  That's a made up thing. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, is it?  All these fucking soaps and shit we're all scrubbing with?  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  No, it's good.  I'd rather have somebody soap up.  When we grew up, there were a lot more germs roaming around and we were all fine.  Yeah, but you know something?  Nothing wrong with getting a few germs on you.  They were Americans germs.  Americans germs.  Not savage, savage germs that they're given now.  God knows what these people have under their fingernails.  The city, um, just fucked the pedicabs in New York City. 
[00:03:30]  Those little pedal fucking tricycle bike cabs.  Well, what happened was...  Rickshaws with fucking pedals.  Yeah, but what happened was, what started this, uh, they wanted to start getting rid of the horse and carriages.  It really started in Central Park, by the way, and then they kind of started expanding from there.  But basically, they started shutting down the horse and carriages in Central Park.  There's still a bunch, but not as many as there used to be.  If you remember that one road, Central Park South, right, it would just be horse and carriages forever. 
[00:04:00]  Yep.  Like blocks.  Lined up.  And now you see, when we drive home, maybe four or five, and there's a few in the park.  So, I mean, the numbers are drastically reduced.  So the pedicab guys went, ah!  We could take, uh, people on tours of Central Park.  Nice, make a little living for ourselves, right?  Yeah.  Start a little business.  And then the problem was, it spread from there, where pedicabs were pretty much everywhere,  all over Manhattan, you know, uh, replacing cabs and stuff at times, when you got a short  little, uh, jaunt that you need to take care of. 
[00:04:30]  Well, I, uh, I wake up this morning to find out the city just fucked those guys over so fucking  bad.  Another small business going down the drain.  Because the only one who's going to be able to afford this, what, uh, Bloomberg has set  forth, is the big guys.  The big companies that own a bunch of these things.  Yeah, one big guy will swoop in, get all the licenses and whatnot, and, uh, and then  just hires schmucks for $7 an hour.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  And there goes another small business.  It's unbelievable.  Bloomberg wants the guys to be now licensed.  Their pedicabs have to be inspected, which, by the way, costs money, and most of these guys  are just living day to day with this dumb pedicab thing.  It's just a bicycle.  I go to Central Park all the time.  Half those guys just, are just roaming around begging for, you know, a customer.  It's, they're not, they're not raking in the dough for the most part.  Yeah.  And then, uh, they, they need, uh, uh, turn signals now.  All this stuff. 
[00:05:30]  A whole list of things.  I'm like, oh boy.  They're, they're trying to shut out the little man.  You know what this is also?  Also, if you look at these guys that run these little pedal cabs, um, they are one pedal  away from pulling out a gun and robbing you if they don't have a job.  These guys are all, like, they just have this criminal look about them.  We talk about that all the time.  When the economy goes bad, you know, some of those fast food workers, some of those pedicab  guys, some of those, uh, janitors and cleanup guys. 
[00:06:00]  Yep.  And you can think of a whole bunch of other, of those kind of low level jobs.  Those are the guys, yeah, that go into crime.  One of these who may be weeded out is, uh, Nicholas, uh, Lacovino, 26, a pedicab driver  for the past four years.  It says he makes $1,500 to $2,000 per week, giving tourist rides through Central Park and  other parts of the city.  Wow.  $1,500 to $2,000 a week.  And then all of a sudden, now you don't have any money.  Oh, the fucking, the sap is coming out. 
[00:06:30]  The lead-filled leather sap is coming out.  I almost had a fistfight with one of those guys.  I really fucking hate him.  I can't stand the motherfucker.  I hate them.  I was saying, in principle, like, I'm pissed because it's another just bureaucratic bullshit  fucking government stepping in and telling people what they can and can't do.  But, realistically, you know, for my selfish self, um, I think it's great because these  guys are nothing but hazards and, uh, uh, they get in my way. 
[00:07:00]  You try to make a right turn and they're sitting there in that fucking right lane, half in,  half out, because they're, uh, and they're peddling in the right lane.  And, and you're trying to get past them.  But you got to fight for the small business guy, Ant.  You got to.  Fuck that.  Deal with the pedicabs.  Uh, people are going, what are, uh, what are pedicabs?  It's basically a guy riding a bike and in, and in the back is, uh, like a, uh, I don't  know, you could sit almost three or four people across.  Yeah.  Picture a rickshaw.  It's pretty much a backseat of a cab with a guy just peddling you along. 
[00:07:30]  It's a rickshaw.  Yeah.  It's a rickshaw.  Instead of the Chinese guy pulling it, it's a guy sitting on a bicycle seat and he's peddling.  We used to have a few of those in Manhattan.  A rickshaw.  I just hate when the, the small business thing goes away like that.  You know?  Yeah.  It's going to be one or two guys just owning that now in the city.  The vending guys used to be, that used to be a nice small business for somebody.  Yeah.  Where they would all come in separately from mostly like Queens with their carts and set  up their hot dogs and their donuts and their bagels. 
[00:08:00]  I never really ate at those places because I actually agree with you with the germs and  stuff, but I see the lines and stuff and those people are making a nice little living.  Yeah.  And then they did the same thing with them with licensing and then, and, uh, inspections and  all sorts of shit where the small guy couldn't afford it anymore.  And then a big guy sweeps in and buys the business.  And now that same small guy that was making a nice living for his family is now probably  doing the same job for like nothing.  No money.  Now he's peddling.  He's doing the same thing. 
[00:08:30]  He made all the money.  But he doesn't own his own little business.  It's like prostitutes.  Now they have a pimp.  Right.  Now they got to pay the pimp and they just get to keep a little bit of money and, and  they get to ride the little bike.  I hate when I see that.  That's all.  I mean, I, I kind of agree with you there.  The pedicabs are annoying.  They are annoying.  You can't walk around without them begging you to, you know, go for, you know, you need  a ride or whatever, but.  And they're always, as when you're driving in the city, they're just constantly in your  way when you're trying to drive through a.  Not anymore, my friend.  Some of the more crowded places in the city.  You're going to see most of them go away. 
[00:09:00]  And the other thing, I don't know how the cabbies are doing in New York.  Dude, I make a really good living and I can't believe how much I'm spending on cabs.  Yeah.  For basic little rides because they threw another surcharge in there.  Surcharge, which is, you know, tax.  Right.  And now like a five, six dollar cab ride is pushing ten dollars.  And I'm not talking like that takes you from one side of the city to the other.  That's like, especially in rush hour traffic, it's, it's, it's what, ten, twelve blocks. 
[00:09:30]  That's it.  By the way, did they ever take that, um, that, uh, surcharge off for, uh, the high  price of gas?  Of course not.  When gasoline shot up to like, uh, four bucks and shit like that, almost five dollars in  some cases.  And the cabs are like, well, we got attack on a surcharge because the gas is just too  much.  Now when the price of gas came down, did they pull it off?  Yeah, I don't think so.  Of course not.  Yeah, I don't think so.  They're going to, here's what they're doing.  Because they, this is the genius of them.  We can pay with credit cards now.  So you don't, the majority of people do that. 
[00:10:00]  And now they're coming up with an easy pass, a MetroCard, they may already have it, where  you kind of just, boom, you zip your thing in.  So you, do you know what the, uh, the tolls are?  Do you know how much it costs right now?  I don't know what tolls are.  Dude, that's ridiculous too.  Because I just easy pass through.  Right, right.  So this is what they're going to do with this.  So you won't even notice it coming out of your, you're not going to notice $80 a month  or $90 a month coming out of your account.  You know, they're fucking smart, man.  They're making it easier to raise prices.  People are noticing, man.  I'm telling you.  It's getting ridiculous out there.  Yeah, I don't really know what the tolls are. 
[00:10:30]  It's when it comes out of your pocket.  Like when I would do tolls, I knew every fucking toll from, from here to Portland, Oregon  or Portland, Maine for that matter.  Oh, Jimmy.  Let me, don't get me started with the easy pass shit with that, uh, uh, uh, Garden State  Parkway.  There are exits that they, how can I explain this?  There's signs on the road that basically say you're going to be paying a toll, but it's  set up in such a way they have actual toll boots to the right and you could keep going  flying to the left.  I mean, not even slowing down.  You're still going 75, 80. 
[00:11:00]  Oh yeah.  And if you're not thinking, it's so easy not to have your easy pass up because you're  not really thinking.  So you fuck up and you go through without your easy pass, right?  You're an easy pass customer.  Next thing you know, you get, um, you get something in the mail says you missed this  toll.  The toll was 50 cents and the surcharge is what?  How much is it?  Like 25, $33.  I think I just got the same.  $30.  Why don't you put your fucking easy pass in the window?  I don't have an easy pass.  I always take my, why do you take it down?  Cause I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  I know that.  No, dude, I know it's partly my fault.  I'm not stupid, but I take it out just cause I don't want, I don't want, I don't want someone  shattering my window to grab it or something.  There's a weird fear that people are going to, I have the same, no one will steal them,  but we think that they will.  I have the same fear.  But these, these scumbags, I, I'm a customer of easy pass.  They know it.  They, they have my license plate cause they take a picture of it.  Yeah.  So why don't they do the right thing and go, well, he obviously is a customer.  We're taking money out of his account.  They're taking it right out of my credit card. 
[00:12:00]  So why is there now a, uh, a service fee?  Cause I, I forgot to put my easy pass on the dashboard for 25, $30 a pop.  Dude, what you can do is this.  And plus the fact, hold on, just to finish this.  It's not that Danny, is it obvious?  Sometimes you go, wow, I didn't even realize I was driving through a toll.  Well, uh, sometimes the thing, the thing about Jersey anyway, is that some, like there's  no person there to take money if you have it.  So if you, if you're stuck there and you don't have change, like you're just, you're  fucked and you just have to go through it.  And that happened to me once too. 
[00:12:30]  I forgot all about that.  Before easy pass, I was coming back from somewhere.  I forgot where, and I got off one of these exits, uh, one of these lower, you know, um, low  traffic exits and he's right.  There's no one to take your money.  And if you don't have exact change, the basket, the little, if you don't have exact change,  you're like, holy fuck.  Yeah.  And then you're digging around in your, your cushions and stuff.  And this was when I wasn't making that much money.  And like Dan said, you got, you got to drive through next thing you know, in the mail,  you get like a fucking hundred dollar, whatever.  Exactly what happened.  I got out of my, you know, I started looking for change in my car and then I actually got 
[00:13:00]  out of my car.  I figured, oh, people probably like missed the basket.  So there's probably some change on that.  Oh, brilliant.  Then I waited for 15 minutes thinking that, all right, well, someone's got to come by.  No one ever did.  And I was just like, fuck it.  I'm tired.  I want to leave.  I hate New Jersey.  And I went through the toll.  But how is that fair?  For real?  Yeah.  Not even having a person there.  That's not justified.  If you don't have exact change.  Yeah.  You won't have to pay that fine though.  Because I've had these things, if you call them, just tell them, look, it was up and  it didn't register.  It does happen.  And they'll see that you're a registered thing and they'll remove the fine and you're 
[00:13:30]  sending the six bucks.  Oh, really?  The toll, yeah.  So what is that?  Like a two-minute phone call probably or an hour and a half as they push you through the  fucking system?  It's actually not as bad as you think.  Push one for English.  Push two for English.  I hadn't registered my new truck, so I was getting fined.  You will have a much easier time because you're a legitimate customer.  And then you keep punching around, punching around.  And then next thing you know, you're at the beginning of the menu.  You know what you do with the exact change basket?  A handful of marmalade. 
[00:14:00]  You just shove it in there.  No, I've actually used it to strain my marmalade.  Because sometimes my marmalade...  It's got little holes in it.  Yeah, I use it as a strainer where I'll take handfuls of marmalade and I mush it through  right onto my bread.  I like squared marmalade on my bread.  Marmalade.  Daryl in Newark.  Daryl.  Yo, Opie.  Hey, Daryl.  You don't have, hey, Anthony, and hello, Gene.  Ah!  Hello.  Listen, you don't have to worry about the administrative fee. 
[00:14:30]  I worked for EasyPass for three years in New Jersey when they took over.  You never have to worry about that.  The only thing you need to do is put your EasyPass account number on the violation on the back of it.  No.  Okay, there'll be a Section C on it.  You fill that out with that information.  Well, this guy really knows.  Sign it and send it in with the amount of the toll.  That's it. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I'll take your word for it next time because the other thing is if you don't pay the fee  and the surcharge within 30 days, then it goes up drastically.  Yeah.  So, I hope you're right.  Yeah, that's right.  So, I hope you're right.  That's a big threat.  It's a fucking robbery.  Basically, that's a deterrent to anybody who is not an EasyPass customer.  All right.  The only thing you have to do is prove that you're an EasyPass customer and it never applies.  You know what, dude?  When I switched to my new truck and I hadn't transferred the plate numbers in all of them, 
[00:15:30]  so I got them on the thruway and it's like there's different companies sending you fucking,  I got, it was a fucking nightmare, but eventually they all took the fines off, but it sucked.  You missing a 50 cent, 75 cent toll could lead to $100 like that.  How is that fair, legal, possible?  Let me say hi to Dave in Westchester.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, Dave.  Here's a great EasyPass story for you. 
[00:16:00]  I drive every day across the Newburgh Beacon Bridge.  I get on and get on up a little bit north of there.  So I get on the thruway in Kingston and a half hour later, I get off the thruway in Newburgh  and it says, you know, call EasyPass.  Well, every day I cross the Newburgh Beacon Bridge and I get called, you know, I get off  the thruway in Newburgh and it says call EasyPass.  Well, six minutes later, every day I go across the Newburgh Beacon Bridge. 
[00:16:30]  I get a bill in the mail, first of all, the toll from Buffalo, because it didn't register  in.  And then I got a $50 surcharge administrative fee for them figuring it out.  So wait, they gave you the toll from the farthest possible one, right?  That's what they do.  Yeah.  The farthest possible place.  The farthest possible place.  So I call them up.  That's bullshit, too.  And they said to me, they said, this woman, right, you could tell she's just hitting the 
[00:17:00]  buttons with her knuckle because of the big fake nails.  She says to me, she says, well, you're going to have to write a letter.  Well, I said, well, listen, no offense, but I got on the thruway, I got off the thruway,  and then I crossed the Newburgh Beacon Bridge.  I didn't go to Buffalo.  She says, well, you're going to have to write a letter because you could be fraud in the  system.  Fraud in the system.  Oh, my.  Fraud in the system.  For how much?  Right.  And now you've got to write letters?  I don't want to write letters. 
[00:17:30]  You figure it out.  I didn't come from Buffalo.  You figure it out.  Right?  I love writing, dear sir or madam.  Do you think anyone's reading your letter?  Dude, it's bizarre.  Letter writers get shit done.  Look at how in radio or TV, fucking five letters can change a show.  There's something about when you write a letter to a company, they freak.  To whom it may concern.  Whatever you want. 
[00:18:00]  Dude, if you wrote a staving EasyPass letter.  Very truly yours.  Most truly, Gregory Hughes.  What does that mean?  Yours truly.  It's like, that sounds like some kind of love thing.  I never understood that.  Yours truly.  Very truly yours.  My dearest savage MTA employee.  Well, you guys want to know what the bridge fee is these days or toll, whatever. 
[00:18:30]  Can I guess?  I think, god damn it, was it $7 last time I remember?  Verrazano?  We're going Verrazano Bridge.  That's $430.  How about a bus over the Verrazano Bridge?  One of the bridges that goes from Manhattan to Staten Island, I guess, right?  Officially?  Or is it Brooklyn?  Goes to Staten Island.  How does that work?  Brooklyn to Staten Island?  Yeah.  Right?  Yep.  Then how do you get from Brooklyn to Manhattan Tunnel?  Okay, right.  The Brooklyn Battery.  Battery. 
[00:19:00]  What if it's cheap way?  There's freeway down there.  Or you can take the Brooklyn Bridge.  Yeah.  Or the Manhattan Bridge.  Or the Williamsburg Bridge.  Or Williamsburg.  What if it's the 9th Street Bridge?  No, that's Queens.  These go all the way up.  People like both boroughs.  No, no, that's Queens.  I know.  I was bored there.  Can we enjoy how stupid I am?  I went, how do you get from Brooklyn to Manhattan?  Well, there's two bridges.  One's called Brooklyn and one's called Manhattan.  You're such a fucking asshole.  I think there's probably more ways to get from Brooklyn to Manhattan than there is any other 
[00:19:30]  borough.  Bill, what do you got on the Verrazano?  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Well, I'm at the tour bus for music groups.  And a tour bus pulling a trailer to go over the Verrazano Bridge is $60 one direction.  Why?  Why does it have to cost $60?  How many axles?  Five axles.  The Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge is $8 per axle. 
[00:20:00]  $45 to go over the GW.  Wow.  I know we sound like a broken record, but where the fuck is all this money?  I know.  Obviously, they're not getting it up because now they're taxing, they're payroll taxing  small businesses that live even outside of New York City to pay for the MTA and pay  for the, you know, it astounds me.  It's a cash business, basically.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is this money going?  What terrible people run that?  Dude, we've been in and out of New York City our whole lives.  Yep.  Has the bridges and tunnels changed that drastically? 
[00:20:30]  No.  It's the same fucking one.  How old is the fucking bridges?  They pave it every once in a while?  I bet you they're using this to pay for, like, the 2nd Avenue subway.  All this stuff.  I mean, that's what they're doing.  They're just using this for all these...  It is.  Projects.  And then pocket lining.  Just think of the amount of trucks that go over the George Washington Bridge on 95.  Just do the math, man.  Dude, I sat there once and counted.  Dude, there's probably 30 a day goes over.  That's a lot of money.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:21:00]  Thanks, Bill.  Thank you, boy.  Bye, Bill.  Aren't they adding another surcharge to flying now, too, I was reading?  You mean...  It's probably the one word that brings more hatred into my soul.  What?  Surcharge.  It's everywhere now.  And I don't even know what it means.  What is the definition of a surcharge for real?  The way that they tax them without saying tax.  Cabs have it.  Flying has.  It's everywhere now.  It's throughout our lives.  Yeah, you get a ticket, and it's like...  We talk about this. 
[00:21:30]  $35 ticket with a $50 surcharge.  Right.  Wait a minute.  That isn't...  I should just pay the ticket part.  You mean, they're asking you to pay for a bag now.  The fucking airlines.  You know what?  Again, the same thing with the fuel.  I understood when the fuel was through the roof and it was a problem.  Yeah, yeah.  But these...  Continental doesn't have any pillows in coach or in first.  None.  And they were saying, oh, it's the swine flu.  Shut up.  It's not the swine flu.  Oh, the swine flu.  That's not it.  That's their excuse. 
[00:22:00]  It's not the swine flu.  Oh.  Why do you still have them on fucking international flights or certain airlines do?  They don't care about the savages outside of the country.  That's true.  I will check that because I am taking Continental.  No pillows, buddy.  I am going to make a to-do.  Doesn't matter.  They don't give a fuck.  To-do!  I had to buy my own blanket.  They don't have blankets either.  What?  Certain flights have blankets.  What if I'm chilly?  You bought your own airplane flight?  I bought a good one from Brookstone.  Jesus.  I went to Brookstone.  I tell you, as I was talking to the guy, a cock was developing in my face in midair. 
[00:22:30]  I'm like, I want something because I catch a little...  I'm laughing at you.  But you are Joe Traveler.  I mean, you're taking a lot of flights.  How many flights a year do you take?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm platinum already for Continental.  Literally, I was at one point doing my next L.A., my next Leno piece, I believe, is November 30th or December 2nd.  So I was doing at least every 10 days back and forth to L.A.  Wow.  Just a tremendous amount.  Wow.  A lot of fucking flying.  I have not been exclusive to Continental this year. 
[00:23:00]  No, you're cheating.  Oh, you're cheating on Continental.  Yeah, I believe I'd like to leave them, but stupid American's too expensive.  How's the other pussy out there?  Oh, fucking good, man.  Nice, right?  All of a sudden, yeah, you open those legs.  Wow, the meals are better.  You guys have United.  I flew from United to Buffalo because I didn't have...  And fuck, from L.A.  Man, the seats were pretty comfortable.  Yeah.  And the fucking big soft blankets and really big blankets and nice little pillows.  Much better than Continental.  Can the airlines just get rid of the ashtrays?  That's all I ask.  You're not supposed to smoke and fly anymore. 
[00:23:30]  No, it's gone.  That's been gone for well over a decade, but they still have the ashtrays on some of these  fucking planes.  That's scary.  Because that just says old.  It says your plane is old.  It doesn't say that, but I understand why you think that.  Really?  I don't want you to be afraid.  Well, because they rebuild the engines.  No, no, no.  But sometimes they just actually take older interiors and put them in a brand new body.  A lot of times they'll have older, like a lot of times the bathrooms you go into, because  those things last forever.  So they build a brand new shell.  And a lot of times you'll get a new interior.  But a lot of times they just take the fucking older interior. 
[00:24:00]  Why refurbish it?  Like it works.  It's clean.  It's not getting used with smoke.  They just leave the ashtray in the wall, in the bathroom.  When I walk into a plane too and I look to the left, I don't want to see just panels.  I know that's the newer shit.  I want to see fucking stuff.  You want to see stuff?  You don't want to see like the glass cockpit?  Dude, you ever get in a really brand new plane and there's nothing up there anymore?  It's just fucking screens.  A few screens.  There's screens.  And that yoke thing.  Your basic gauges. 
[00:24:30]  They still have the yoke.  Yeah, the yoke.  They got that.  But yeah, you look in the cockpit and just see the glass cockpit, they call it.  I want those numbers that you can hear them turning.  You want dials?  Yeah, you know.  Wow, where it's like whipping around when you're going up and down.  That flat screen stuff.  I know I'm on a brand new plane, but it scares the shit out of me.  You want to see what the carts are like in Mexico City?  Oh, God.  The fucking vending carts? 
[00:25:00]  That would be horrible.  Let's go to Mike in Baltimore.  Mike?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hi, Mike.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, guys.  I just got back into town from Mexico City for my work, and you want to talk about savages.  It's like the animals are feeding the animals.  They've got these giant poles with meat that they slice off and they hand out to the other savages.  I've been shitting through a straw for the last week.  It sounds like a gyro, you know? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, except there's flies and mosquitoes.  And we went by this shopping district, and they've got these adobes with these plastic parps over top of them,  and they're frying all kinds of bullshit.  And you can see the filth under their fingernails.  It was just absolutely disgusting.  There's no hand-washing going on there, believe me.  But we grew up fine with all those germs roaming around.  We'll punch it out, boys.  All right.  I think the last hot dog I ate from a hot dog vendor here in New York, it was when we were working at N.E.W. 
[00:26:00]  They had the guy right on the corner there on 7th and 56th.  And I went down there, and he wasn't wearing gloves.  But for the most part, they take the tongs, right?  And then they take the piece of wax paper to pick the bun up with, and then the tongs,  and they put the weenie in the bun.  And it's fine.  He didn't touch it.  This guy grabbed the bun with his bare hand, put the weenie on it with the tongs, 
[00:26:30]  and then with a thumb that had a Nosferatu fingernail on it,  like shoved the dog down into the bun.  That's going to drive you nuts.  And I was just watching it the whole time going,  I should just walk away because I'm not eating this.  And he gives it to me, and I paid him, and I walked away,  and fucking walked into the building, and threw it right in the goddamn garbage.  Because all I was thinking was that finger poking down on my weenie. 
[00:27:00]  They do other great things with that finger, though.  If they give you too much sauerkraut, now there's kind of moving the sauerkraut around.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They can move it around.  If the mustard gets on the bun, they're going to scrape it off with that one finger.  That one finger is magical to them.  Don't fucking touch it.  The wax paper and the tongs, all right, I could deal with that on some level.  Those hot dogs are ridiculously good.  You're missing out.  They really are good.  Sauerkraut, a little mustard.  I haven't had one. 
[00:27:30]  Damn it, I want one.  In years, I have not had one of those.  Yeah.  You're going to go fucking, what's it called, hot dogs?  I'll buy a place, Gray's Papaya?  No, Gray's Papaya.  Oh, yeah, yeah, those are good.  Those are good.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And they're like a dollar or something?  Dude, they fucking rule.  How much are they?  They're like a dollar.  They're like a dollar.  Dude, remember what I had at the party when Patrice came over and cooked?  They were fucking Kobe beef hot dogs.  That sounds good.  Barbecued.  It was better than a steak. 
[00:28:00]  Sounds good.  This fucking hot dog.  Is there anything better than a grilled hot dog?  Oh.  I know steaks are better on a grill, but that-  If they're good hot dogs, yeah.  You grill up a fucking hot dog, let that split, get a little dark.  And then me and Keith were shopping for the party, and we're getting good meat and shit  like that, and burgers and stuff.  And he goes, remember the old days where you'd just pick up those Mike's Burgers, the box,  where you'd open it up and they were just petrified frozen, and they were white.  It wasn't even red meat, it was like fucking some flecks of meat in with just soy and filler 
[00:28:30]  and crushed bone.  It's the old days for you, but it's current days for everybody listening to us right now.  They're still buying those things.  Mike's Burgers suck.  Fuck no, they were great.  Oh, they were terrible, and I had the picture of little Mike on the front and said, my daddy  makes them.  Mmm.  There was something to be said for those cheap burgers.  Yeah.  I don't know what the taste was all about.  They tasted really good.  I don't know.  Even though the quality of the meat sucked.  They really didn't have much of a taste to them, is what it was. 
[00:29:00]  You and Keith shopping for a party, getting people to come like a midnight cowboy, just  picking out interesting people.  It don't say nothing about you.  Listen to this story, man.  Pat in Buffalo.  Pat.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys, we're in a convoy of Trade Center Steel.  There's debris from the Trade Center that's been down in Maryland from the time of the attack  until about a month and a half ago.  We came back with a police escort, 25 trucks, and every toll authority from Maryland all the 
[00:29:30]  way up to the Port Authority waived the tolls.  MTA made us sit there until we came up with $750 for the 25 trucks.  And then they would let them escort us through the city so we could cross the goddamn Whitestone  Bridge.  Isn't that amazing?  What fucking scumbag.  And you're saying every other toll area lets you guys fly through? 
[00:30:00]  Every other toll, the Jersey Turnpike, the toll in Maryland, the George Washington Bridge,  they waived that.  We had to pay it across the fucking Whitestone.  I wonder if that money will come back, though.  I wonder if that money will be reimbursed to the right people to fucking bitch that.  I don't know.  The best part is, since that happened, now some of the drivers are dead and are starting  to get easy pass violation letters for that bridge because they ran us through an easy  pass lane, even though we had paid cash. 
[00:30:30]  Unbelievable.  Assholes.  They just got us.  They just got us.  Yeah.  I don't know how to, I don't know how you change the system.  The system's broken.  I don't know how, I don't know what you do.  They just got us.  They don't.  It's a hundred dollars for a truck to come into one of the inner boroughs.  Yeah.  Like, 40 bucks and then 30 to get in the inner bridge, 30 to get back out.  And, you know, everybody's starving here, but they gotta fucking keep sticking it up our  ass.  There you go.  Punch it out, guys.  Have a good morning. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you, man.  You know, it's a little example of some government gone awry is Corazine, who's still in office,  but he's a, you know, lame duck, because they got the new guy.  Oh, right.  Jersey.  I'm starting to forget his name already.  Yeah.  Chris Christie's a new guy.  No, I know.  Chris Christie.  They're having a debate about gay marriage in Jersey.  And I guess Corazine said if the bill comes across his desk, he'll sign it.  And Christie is like, I'm not going to sign the thing. 
[00:31:30]  So Corazine is trying as quickly as possible to get everybody on board and get the bill  written up so he can sign it off.  And that seems to me to be like, wouldn't you give some thought?  Now, I, like I said, gay marriage, fine by me, whatever the fuck.  But wouldn't you think if the guy that lost the election based on the public voting, he  shouldn't be signing shit into law that the next guy coming in wouldn't sign because the  public pretty much has spoken like, so, so why, why would he sign that into law? 
[00:32:00]  And I'm just using the gay marriage example that came up.  But a lot of these lame duck politicians do this.  They pass their own agendas knowing that the public voted them the fuck out because they  didn't like your agenda.  Well, they're technically fulfilling the obligations they have.  They've been elected to, even though people have said we don't want you again.  They weren't elected for one and a half terms.  They were elected for two terms.  Yeah, I understand that.  But you know something, it just seems to me they are not doing what the, uh, what the  public really wants. 
[00:32:30]  Um, that's, that's all.  It just seems to me a little underhanded.  It's like a technicality, though.  Sit out your...  Because technically he's still in the job.  Sit out your fucking gig, do some fucking appearances, wave to people, and then get the  fuck out of office.  You start signing important legislation, and it fucks shit up for the next guy coming in  that the people wanted in there.  What about when the president leaves?  He shoves a lot of things through.  Oh, boy, does he?  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Oh, you should...  You're pardoned, you're pardoned, you're pardoned, you're pardoned, you're pardoned. 
[00:33:00]  He pardons a bunch of people.  You should study...  There should be a show on that.  Oh, my God.  The last week of a presidency is just...  It's amazing.  It really is.  If you want to talk about an easy pass...  It really is amazing.  The bills that they signed, the fucking favors that they give to states that supported them.  Oh, shit.  Oh, ridiculous.  Signing bills to burn down entire forests, whatever, whatever.  I don't know.  Just crazy shit goes on.  I think that's the scariest time.  Yeah.  I guess that's the scam, though, when you're getting out. 
[00:33:30]  Whatever.  Right.  But that's just another thing.  Oh, the parting thing is hilarious, though.  Yeah.  Just criminal after criminal after criminal.  I'd pothon you.  I'd pothon you.  Because you're friends with the guy or whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, let's go to Amsterdam.  Fuckin' A.  Are you really in Amsterdam, Jamie?  Why would I lie about that, guys?  What time is it?  I don't even...  Let me do the time here.  Six hours.  Six hours which way?  The other way, right?  So it's...  I'm going to go with...  All right, let me guess.  I'm going to go with one...  Almost one in the afternoon. 
[00:34:00]  You would be correct.  It's almost lunchtime for me.  Nice.  Figured I'd give you guys a quick call.  Cool.  This is choco.  I'd put it up against that Amsterdam shit any day.  Oh, the fast food over here is the worst in the world.  There are vending machines that you put a euro in and take out a hamburger, and then  the guy in the back just grabs another hamburger, throws it in with his hand, and then somebody  else comes along.  You're sitting there, grabbing these burgers.  And the thing is, they're the busiest things.  There's McDonald's.  There's a Burger King.  And right in the middle is this place called Feebo, and that's where everyone goes because 
[00:34:30]  the burgers are a euro, and they're actually pretty good.  It's probably one of the most disgusting places you ever eat.  But before I lived here, I lived in Hungary, and the food was even worse there.  I mean, you couldn't, you'd go into those places and get one of those gyros, and they  would just throw it together, you know, reach in with their hands.  It was just disgusting, but when in Europe?  Yes, be disgusting, I guess.  I don't know.  It's kind of cool in a way.  I don't know.  The urons over here are pretty just gross.  We've got too many regulations in this country. 
[00:35:00]  It's getting out of control.  I kind of like the fact that you could get a hamburger through a vending machine.  A vending machine.  Well, you guys were talking about prices earlier and taxes.  A liter of gas over here is a euro 50, and there's 3.8 liters in a gallon.  So that figures out to about 7 euros for a gallon.  That's $10.  I'm so confused.  Stop with the fucking...  Euro.  Stop with liter.  Nobody likes liters.  I'm with you.  I drive a bicycle.  A gallon.  He drives a bicycle.  Of course you do. 
[00:35:30]  You're an absolute...  The whole dumb world.  I love the fact that America went, fuck you, to the whole planet.  We just refuse.  We're the only ones.  Gallons.  Holding up, for the most part.  How much is that?  It's $10 a gallon, then?  It's big as that.  It depends on the exchange rate.  Anywhere from $9 to $10 a gallon.  But they pay it.  They pay it over here.  But all the cars are just microscopic.  I mean, they get 40, 50 miles for the gallon.  Little cars.  People aren't driving that far.  There's nowhere to drive, really.  Yeah, where are you going?  In an hour, you could drive through, what, eight countries or something?  Through that tunnel, going to France. 
[00:36:00]  I can get in a car and drive to France or Germany in two hours.  Jamie, are you from America originally?  I'm from Boston.  I used to listen to you guys way back in the day.  Boston.  Oh, right on.  Now I catch you guys on the mornings here or the afternoons for me.  Very cool.  Well, thanks, Jamie.  I appreciate that.  Hey, have a good day, guys.  You too.  Happy birthday to Jimmy from Amsterdam.  That's what I'm going to tell this asshole right now.  I just can't get that out of my head now.  What?  Eric Stoltz of Pulp Fiction.  All the funny things. 
[00:36:30]  When the phone's ringing and he's trying to watch that TV show, and it's fucking Travolta  because Mia's ODing, and the phone's ringing, ringing, ringing.  He's eating cereal, and he's watching TV.  The look he gives over at the phone, the look of contempt he gives at that phone for interrupting  his television watching is classic.  He was not happy.  Oh, he wasn't happy at all.  Hot under the collar.  He just let the phone ring and ring and ring before he just, his eyes dart over to the phone  like, what the, I'm watching this. 
[00:37:00]  And it was just some bad Three Stooges or something.  What was he watching?  That's a good trivia question.  What was he watching?  I think it was Three Stooges.  Voss and Bonnie's pilot.  They're going to come in with that, sir.  I know.  Is it Voss and today?  Yeah, Voss will be here, I don't know, about an hour, maybe.  Rich, what do you got?  Hey, yeah, I was working in D.C. one day, and there's this vendor sitting on the side  of the road with, oh yeah, it was three people's out with fruit on it.  And he just whipped out his dick and just started pissing on the side of the road, didn't even 
[00:37:30]  try to hide it, and stood there looking at everybody, and not too sanitary, I'd say.  Yeah, well, he's got to pee, but he can't clean his hands.  It's just, there's no fucking reason for that.  He didn't even try to hide it.  I mean, it just, well, it wasn't that big, but stood there, hanging out, and, you know,  pretty gross.  Yeah, because there isn't any place for him to, any place for him to wash. 
[00:38:00]  So he's just, like, touching his dick, and now he's touching your food.  And his savage, unclipped cheese dick.  Sorry, I just, Danny popped the scene up.  Look at how annoyed he is.  He's watching a Three Stooges episode.  He's probably seen a thousand times.  What's the cereal?  Fruit Brute.  Yes, Fruit Brute.  He's eating Fruit Brute.  Look at him laughing.  Smiling.  And then when he gets the cage over the head, he actually, like, goes, oh!  Like, like, he...  Oh! 
[00:38:30]  And he's smoking, too, which is so disgusting.  Eating cereal and smoking.  And eating cereal.  Answer the goddamn phone, Lance.  Look at how he looks.  This was a pretty good...  This was a great scene in Pulp Fiction, man.  Goddamn.  I've got to throw that in again now.  The ashtray up there by the fucking cereal.  How gross is that?  Yeah, he is not, uh...  He is pretty gross.  Funny fucking movie.  Yeah, the savages, like, I can't even... 
[00:39:00]  I can't do it anymore.  And then my ex...  Uh, not wife.  Girlfriend.  Right.  They're Melinda.  Which one?  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, yeah, I consider that the ex.  The rest weren't really girlfriend things.  They don't want to hear that.  Ah, fuck.  There's probably a few out there that don't want to hear that.  Ah, whatever.  Fuck them.  Oh, jeez.  Fuck them.  We're just whatever.  Oh, my God.  And, uh, they, uh...  She, uh, was completely against the buffet.  Like, any time there was a buffet, she'd be like, 
[00:39:30]  I'm not fucking eating at a buffet.  Buffet's rule.  And she pointed out a few, like, things as we were sitting there.  And I'm like, oh, my God, you're right.  You're fucking right.  Well, everyone uses their hand eventually.  Yeah, people just...  Something falls somewhere.  Whatever.  The tongs fall on the floor constantly,  and people just pick them up and put them back in.  And, and, and...  It's a five-second rule, though.  Yeah, but they're, the tongs are falling exactly where a thousand shoes from outside are stepping.  Side by side, there they go. 
[00:40:00]  That's where your tongs are going.  And then the sneeze guard, I don't want to hear it.  I've seen people have conversations where spit is flying out of their mouth and landing in the food.  Landing right in the fucking food.  And then, uh, uh, the fingers being touched.  They're, they're grabbing things because they can't find the tongs.  So they're just grabbing in there.  Scratching, itching, picking ears, noses, scratching dicks.  And then just having to piss her with the fucking food.  Buffets?  No!  Done.  Done with buffets, though.  I haven't had a buffet, and I can't tell you how long. 
[00:40:30]  I, I don't mind a breakfast buffet, because that stuff hasn't been out that long.  Um, I won't eat the ones in the deli.  No, I, I'll go to the guy that's, like, cooking omelets.  Whoa, you...  And go, all right, cook me up something.  You won't eat at a, at a, uh, buffet in a deli?  I certainly won't.  No.  They're basically on every corner.  Dude, they're terrible.  Bunch of hot food.  Oh, fuck.  Just waiting for you.  Who wouldn't eat that?  No.  I mean, if you're homeless, I understand, but yeah, really.  Homeless, it's regular fucking people eating that.  Homeless.  I've had, I've eaten there a couple times.  Oh, nerds to that. 
[00:41:00]  The food is, the food is delish.  And that goddamn, uh, any, any time there's soup in a buffet, where it's just sitting out  there in a tureen, it's in the tureen back.  We see the crud building up.  Yeah, yeah.  The crust is around the thing, and then the ladle also, there's, there's rings of crust  around the ladle for how low it's getting.  Right, right, right.  Do you understand?  When it's like, if like chicken soup has been sitting there all day, and like, you  got to break through that skin to get through the soup. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, the fucking hard skin that's on top of it.  It's like when a load is hardening on your stomach.  You try to ignore that that same shit is in your fucking arteries.  Oh, yeah, right.  As long as it's, uh, heated nice and hot, it doesn't look like that inside me.  Uh, listen to this story.  Gennaro Corum.  What's up, Gennaro?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  In, uh, 2005, I was part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and, uh, we went, we made  a stop in Dubai, and, uh, when you pull into the ports, all the vendors, they get all excited 
[00:42:00]  because they know, you know, we've been at sea or we've been in the desert for kind of  knows how long, so they bring all their food there.  And, uh, this one guy, uh, he had a gyro cart, and he pulls up, and when food just smells  like body odor, you probably shouldn't eat it, but we all decided, you know, what the  hell, and it gave us severe food poisoning.  I ended up puking so bad, and, and the convulsions from my body ended up twisting my testicles. 
[00:42:30]  Wow, really?  Yeah, I had, I had to lay on the table while the doctor pretty much massaged my, uh, balls  Your balls back where they belong in your bag?  It was, it was probably one of the most painful things of my life.  Where was this food store?  Where'd you get?  What cart?  This was in Dubai.  Oh, Dubai.  Yeah, yeah.  Dubai's a fucking really, uh, rich place, so I'm surprised.  Wow.  It is, it's, it's, it's all, it's really kind of disgusting over there when you're not  in downtown Dubai.  United Arab Emirates is really where you land, um, and, you know, it's, it's either really rich 
[00:43:00]  or really poor.  It's kind of funny, one spot in Dubai, you have a KFC, and then right next to the  street is a DFC, a Dubai fried chicken.  Oh, well, I bet that's really good.  It was a good time.  How is, I hear Dubai's in, like, that's one place in the Middle East I would go, it's  like, uh, they said, I imagine those sheiks or whoever runs the place is paying off.  I think they're going broke, though.  Dubai?  Yeah.  Supposedly there's a lot of construction that is just, but no, no, but they're on hold. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, everything's on hold.  The construction's just kind of on hold, there's a bunch of shit going on there.  Stupid people said that.  Money's pulling out.  They were pouring money into that place, and then all of a sudden everything, not everything,  but a lot of stuff just stopped.  Tallest building in the world is there.  I want to go into that hotel.  What's the name of the hotel, sir?  It's like the tallest building in the world?  I don't remember.  It's shaped like a sailboat.  It's got a tennis court at the top of it.  It's just ridiculous.  They got way too much money.  They have, if you look this up, they have constructed, like, islands that are in the structure 
[00:44:00]  of the earth.  Yeah, we've seen that.  But it's like, it's incredible over there, and like I said, you're either really rich  or really poor.  I see you're going with the name Gennaro.  What's the matter?  McLean too good for you?  That's my first name, brother.  I get that all the time.  Okay.  That's not the tallest building in the world, though.  The tallest building in the world is fucking pretty tall.  It's like, no, it's almost, I want to say 1,700 feet.  It's like almost twice the height of the towers. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  They were 1,000-something, 1,200 feet.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Precious is on TV again.  That fat load of shit.  Precious.  Look at Monique.  I can't even feel like that.  Monique don't like Precious.  Oh, Monique's got that cigarette hanging out of her mouth.  Monique has a problem with Precious.  Oh, her neck is going back and forth.  Oh, hell yeah.  That Precious is one of the, like, most gruesome chicks I've ever seen.  She is gruesome.  You know that Mariah Carey's in this movie? 
[00:45:00]  I saw her, yeah.  And she bitched because she wasn't allowed to wear her makeup for her role.  Was she supposed to be a glamour queen?  I don't know.  I think she's a teacher or something.  She had to dress down, obviously, because it's Precious, man.  This movie's fucked up.  Gabby Sadiq.  What's her name?  I don't know.  She looks all right when you clean her up, though.  No, she doesn't.  I said all right.  I didn't say, like, amazing.  No, she's a fat girl, but she has very good skin, like, smooth fat girl face.  Of course.  It's all fucking bloated.  It's like taking a balloon and blowing it up.  It's going to be smooth. 
[00:45:30]  Smooth.  Smooth.  It's going to be all smooth.  Precious.  All right.  There's two more stories, and then we'll move on.  Mike in New York talking about, I guess, vendors.  Mike, what up?  Mike?  Mike?  What's up, guys?  I saw a homeless guy one time in one of those fountains in Midtown, and then there was  one of the street vendors right outside of that fountain, and after the homeless guy  was done taking his little bath of it or washing up, the street vendor turns around with his  little coffee pot, dips it into the toilet, and pours his thing to make his coffee for the 
[00:46:00]  day.  No fucking way.  A little nasty.  No way.  And he took the water from the fountain.  The water out of the fountain that the homeless guy was just bathing in, and made all the  Midtown corporate gentlemen's coffee for the day.  You know, you've got to be fucking crazy to eat at one of those places.  That drives you nuts?  You see the guys that, like, dude, there's a line down the block for these guys that are 
[00:46:30]  just some kind of monkey meat is on the grill, and they're flailing around with the spatulas.  It smells good, though, doesn't it, when you walk by those places?  Oh, it smells delicious, I'm sure.  It's the best.  Oh, it's lamb.  Gyro's.  Gyro's.  However the fuck you say.  Is it lamb?  Gyro's.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  How do you know?  I eat it all the time.  Oh, Christ.  Exactly.  I'll look at you.  It's five bucks, lamb over rice.  Fucking macaque.  That's good.  It's macaque meat.  Macaque.  Cameron in Tennessee. 
[00:47:00]  What's up, Bonet?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Yimmy.  Hi, Cameron.  Hey, I just got back from Iraq.  I was up in Mosul, and these guys, they bring out this platter with rice and this boiled  chicken and probably rat shit in there.  And these guys, like, they just eat with their hands.  They just dip their hands in this rice and then pull the chicken off with their shit hands,  and they fucking, they want me to eat it.  I'm sitting there and, I got a dysentery twice from those cocksuckers. 
[00:47:30]  Like, they're doing you a favor, man.  Like, they're doing you a fucking favor.  Here you go.  Eat from my shit hand that I wipe my ass with.  Jonathan, my manager, went to, it was somewhere in, I want to say Timbuktu, Africa.  Of course.  And he went there with a friend, and he showed me a photo.  It might have been Ethiopia, actually.  Oh, good food there.  Where the guy, the outdoor guy selling meat, they were selling it, and he said,  there's flies, and you could see the guy with a machete, and there's a slab of horrible-looking meat laid out, 
[00:48:00]  and there's flies on it.  Of course.  And he ate it.  He fucking ate it.  That's the least of his problems.  I think he was shitting.  I think he actually did get really sick from that, where his friend got really sick from it.  He's traveling to some crazy places.  And this is after, and they give you shots to keep you from getting sick,  and all you've got to do is eat something, and your body just goes,  what the fuck did you just put in me?  He got married, right?  And he didn't have any clients, just close friends, because there's probably too many clients. 
[00:48:30]  So I didn't even know he was getting married.  Dude, his wife made him get married in Palm Springs, but I forget, I knew he picked the honeymoon spot.  Oh, Christ.  Where did he go?  Africa.  They're going around the holiday.  It's Africa somewhere.  It's somewhere when you hear that you're going to go,  why would you go there with your friends, let alone on your honeymoon?  There's nowhere I would ever want to go in Africa.  There's probably a few spots.  Come on, man.  No.  I'd go on a safari.  I would go to Kenya to see a safari.  Yeah.  Crazy. 
[00:49:00]  Parts of Kenya are safe, eh?  They don't bother you there?  No, it's tourism.  Are you out of your mind?  I think you would love South Africa.  What?  I would have.  You'd be too conservative for me.  Maybe a few years ago.  Well, South Africa's kind of changed over the past.  Actually, if you go there and just cry openly to what they did to the place.  You just boo.  Right.  Boo.  Do you want to keep going with this?  These stories just make me laugh.  I don't know why.  Yeah, this is fantastic.  Frank in Jersey.  Frank.  Frank in Jersey.  Frank was better.  Frank E. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I used to work on the Seaside Heights, New Jersey boardwalk.  Oh, great.  A real famous cheesesteak stand right in the middle.  They used to keep their rolls underneath the boardwalk in these clear plastic bags.  Had to go down there one time.  All straight cats living on them, chewing through the bags.  You see them bring up a bag, just slop the cheesesteak right in there, devour them.  Oh, damn.  But we don't get, for the most part, we don't get sick.  Well, you know what?  You're right. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, I still eat them.  If you, if you really knew what they did with your food before you ate it, you probably  wouldn't eat ever again.  Danny's looking at, I guess, Cape Town, South Africa.  Yeah.  There seems to be a resort there.  Sure.  Why don't you go there?  Yeah.  No, I'll go to Soweto.  That'll be a nice place.  Yeah, they, like, right on the beach, they got some, uh, resorts, highway pools, things  like that.  Yeah, that's nice.  But, uh, if you go over by the Tin Shack shanty part, uh, which I, I don't know exactly 
[00:50:30]  where that is, but, um, Southwest Township, yeah, that's, that's some good stuff right there.  I don't even know if they still have that.  I think that's where they drove Whitey.  When Whitey was running that joint.  Wow.  It was, uh, you know, it was, uh, a tourist spot.  Now, you get one of those, um, South African tire gasoline necklaces.  That's pretty nice.  A lot of, a lot of in-ground pools from, uh, from Satellite View. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Fucking Google's Satellite View is fucking frightening.  Isn't it really?  Dude, that's South Africa you're looking at.  That's cool.  Oh, those look a little, no, no, those look a, maybe that's the poor part of town.  All right, let's say hi to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony's not happy with us.  What's up, Tony?  Why, Tony, welcome aboard.  Anthony, fuck you.  Here I am on Pearl Street, getting ready to go to Canal Street, where there's probably  fucking cats and mice and rats, and I, all I want to do is have breakfast, I want to  have lunch today.  Fuck you, I can't eat for a week. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, these guys depend on the, the vendors out there.  Yeah, I understand.  Look, I went through the same thing.  I, I used to work for a living, and I ate off of those goddamn coffee trucks out there  on Long Island, and, um, I used to get the egg sandwiches off of the truck, and they were  wrapped in plastic, and you don't know how long they've been there, and it said, um, made  in Central Islip.  So, I knew, like, there probably were people making these things out, Central Islip, not  the best part of, of, uh, the island, and, uh, ooh, but, but, but, I never got sick off 
[00:52:00]  of it.  Lucky me.  Guys, we, uh, have to...  Oh, okay, now it's looking a little grim.  We have to break into, uh, this topic because...  What?  ...we have a very mysterious caller.  Oh, no!  What?  ...calling in.  Hi, who's this?  This is the 202 fugitive.  I'm sending the person, a person you very know is on the way.  He will be delivering food, and he will be also handing you dishes for you to eat, eat 
[00:52:30]  on his food.  Who is this?  This is driving me nuts.  Come on, who is this?  Who is this?  Tell us who you are.  Wow.  I will just have to give you a hint of who I am.  I grew up in Woodside.  You're lying!  I'm not, I'm not lying.  In Woodside, Queens?  Yeah, that's where I grew up. 
[00:53:00]  All right, could you tell me, I'm going to ask you a question.  What is your favorite sports team?  Where my favorite team is, the Mets, just like the person I'm sending.  Oh, just like the person you're sending.  Hmm, this is very...  So you're sending a liaison, somebody that will give us a message from you?  He will be sending food, but he will also be handing a cup of his jizz. 
[00:53:30]  What kind of food?  Why would we eat food when you're bringing jizz?  Or he's bringing jizz?  And he's going to humiliate E-Rock.  Humiliate E-Rock.  He has to eat the jizz on the food.  How are you getting the jizz up here?  Yeah.  He's going to...  He will hand you a cup of a load he just dropped. 
[00:54:00]  A load he just dropped.  And why do we have to accept your jizz?  And why does E-Rock have to pour the jizz on his food this morning?  And who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Wow.  That'll be revealed after the Thanksgiving break.  Wow.  That long?  We have to wait?  Really?  Trying to figure out who this is for a couple of days here.  I thought we moved on from the future to have been two days ago.  I know.  Jesus. 
[00:54:30]  Weird.  Queens Motoring.  Does that mean anything to you?  The guy I'm sending, his uncle works there.  Oh, the guy you're sending.  All right.  His uncle works there.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And he lives in the same neighborhood as me.  Oh, he lives in the same neighborhood.  Are you lying?  I'm not lying. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  What is your goal, the fugitive?  What is your goal?  You came back to get.  I'm sure Mel respects O&A.  What?  Mel.  He wants Mel to.  Mel Kazakhstan.  Oh, you didn't hear that?  He stole the money from Mel.  What was it?  Carstan?  Carstan or something. 
[00:55:30]  Did you steal money from Mel?  Yeah.  I did it to get him to respect you guys.  He stole money from Mel while Mel was sleeping, Jimmy.  Yeah, apparently.  What's Mel's last name again?  Carzistan.  Carzistan.  Carzistan.  I know I said it wrong.  I mean Carmazan.  So, Mel, Carzistan, you stole $10,000 from. 
[00:56:00]  Where does he keep it when he sleeps?  I don't know.  I found it in his bag.  I looted his bag when he was asleep.  Oh, you snuck into his house?  No, in his office.  So, he sleeps in his office.  I sensed someone in his office.  Wait.  So, Mel, you're trying to say that the owner, basically, of SiriusXM sleeps in his office?  Why not if our producer can?  All right. 
[00:56:30]  So, Fugitive, what time can we expect your jizz to arrive here?  Where are you right now, Fugitive?  I'm sending the guy.  Where are you?  No, no.  Where are you right now?  Right now, where are you? 
[00:57:00]  I'm on my way to Manhattan to drop off the guy.  Why do you have to drop him off?  Why can't the guy just come by himself?  Yeah.  I'm handing him the stuff, helping him carry the food.  All right.  Then, he's with you.  Can we talk to the guy right now?  I can only give you a hint of the guy.  He's a very familiar face.  Well, put him on the phone.  Yeah, put him on the phone.  He's right there.  Put him on the phone if he's right there.  He's next to me.  Hold on. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Okay.  Yes.  This is Bobo.  The fugitive has sent me.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  Wait a minute.  What's going on?  The fugitive is sending you?  He's sending me to do this.  Bobo, you okay?  You're not in trouble, are you?  Yeah.  Is he being nice to you or is he holding you hostage?  No, he's a nice guy.  He lives in my neighborhood.  He's a good guy.  Oh, yeah?  Have you known him for a while?  Yeah, he listens to the show. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, he listens to the show.  Can we talk to him again?  No problem.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's right in the front seat.  Hold on.  All right.  Let's hear.  All right.  The fugitive.  The fugitive.  You're not hurting Bobo, are you?  No, I'm not hurting him.  Yeah.  I would not hurt my own neighbor.  He's a good friend of mine.  I want to make sure you're not hurting him.  Put Bobo back on the phone.  Okay.  Hold on.  Yes.  Bobo speaking. 
[00:58:30]  Hi, Bobo.  You sure he's not hurting you?  Yeah.  He's not touching your hiney or anything?  No, no.  You know what happened with your brother?  Your brother raped you.  What do you think the fugitive will do?  Yeah.  No, there's nothing going on with the fugitive.  The fugitive ain't harming me.  It's a single bit.  So how are you and the fugitive traveling around right now?  Uh, he's, he's traveling by, he's, he's escorting me by, by a, by a bus.  Well, I got, Bobo, I got an email from the fugitive last night and it was a creepy email. 
[00:59:00]  He was implying that he was a homosexual and he planned on hurting you.  Well, that was not the real guy.  Well, let's talk to the fugitive to find out.  Can we talk to the fugitive?  Put him back on.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Call her.  Okay.  So how come fugitive, how come I got a really weird email from Bobo last night and he was  saying that he, he was being hurt by you.  It was not Bobo.  How do you know? 
[00:59:30]  Because I know his Twitter account.  It's Mr. Matt.  Hey.  No, but it was an email, not a Twitter.  You're lying.  Oh, it was an email.  So you're not a fugitive.  I mean, you're not a homosexual.  I'm keeping confused.  No.  Because the email I got was very, very scared from Bobo and he said that you were going  to hurt him and I, he was very afraid of you.  That was a fake.  Bobo, you're not working today?  You want me to put Bobo on the phone? 
[01:00:00]  We do actually, yes.  I'm glad the fugitive is smarter than Anthony.  Put Bobo on the phone.  I was trying.  I know you are.  I'm glad he figured you out.  There was a little delay there.  Hold on.  I'm watching a swish.  Bobo, you want me to put Bobo on the phone?  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get Bobo on the phone.  Get Bobo on the phone.  All right.  Yes, Bobo's too big.  All right.  There we go.  Hi, Bobo.  So are you going to hurt Bobo?  Yeah, well, I'm doing fine. 
[01:00:30]  The fugitive ain't harming me.  Oh, now you don't have to work?  No, today I'm being, that's why I'm on my way.  I'm on my way today.  And the fugitive doesn't have to work today?  And you're holding your own jizz right now?  You had to get your own jizz for this whole thing?  No, I got, no, when I get there, I got to drop a load.  Put Bobo on the phone.  Yeah, get Bobo on the phone.  Yeah, can we talk to Bobo?  This is Bobo you're speaking to.  Oh, okay, so I got confused.  The phone's going back and forth.  So is the fugitive harming you? 
[01:01:00]  No, he's not harming me.  So why is he accompanying you to the gig?  Yeah, why is he accompanying you?  He wanted to carry the stuff.  How much stuff are you bringing?  Yeah, really.  You don't have to get here.  It's the food, it's the turkey and stuff.  I can't wait to talk to the fugitive while you're in studio.  I want us to get him on the phone and talk to him while you're here.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's going to be good.  Well, the fugitive, you're not going to see him.  And he's going to leave as soon as he drops, as soon as we head right by the building. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but then we want you to call him live from the studio so we can hear you guys talk to each other.  Well, the fugitive doesn't leave his cell number.  Well, he can call us then.  Yeah, just tell him to call us when you're in studio.  That's right.  That's a very good idea.  Well, he doesn't want to call me at the same time he's in the studio.  He has to head to work.  Well, wait, where's the fugitive work?  He's keeping that very disclosed location. 
[01:02:00]  Very disclosed location.  Put him on the phone immediately.  Yeah, let's talk to the fugitive because I've got to figure this out.  All right.  The fugitive call.  So where do you work now?  Hold on.  Put Bobo back on the phone for a second.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  So you're saying that you work.  Put the fugitive.  We want the fugitive.  Yeah, where's the fugitive?  Yeah, we need the fugitive.  Well, he's keeping it a secret. 
[01:02:30]  Put him on the phone.  Yeah, we want to talk to him.  Bobo, we want to make sure you're all right.  All right.  Well, I could put him on the phone.  Yeah, put him on the phone.  Put him on the phone.  Well, when he's talking about the fugitive call,  this is the fugitive.  What's Bobo wearing right now so we can recognize him when he comes in?  Oh, when he comes in, he's wearing an O-1A shirt and a lipstick.  All right.  Let's talk to Bobo.  Yeah, let's talk to Bobo. 
[01:03:00]  Put Bobo on, quick.  This is Bobo speaking.  Bobo, what is the fugitive wearing right now?  What is he wearing?  Yes.  He's also keeping that a secret.  No, we want to know to make sure.  Just say it.  Just say it, please.  You're there with him.  He said he wasn't going to hurt you.  So what is he wearing?  Oh, no.  He's just wearing a serious hoodie.  Why would he wear a serious hoodie?  How would he get one? 
[01:03:30]  Does he work here, Bobo?  Is that what you're trying to say?  No, no.  Oh, the fugitive works here.  No, no, he doesn't work there.  He borrowed my hoodie.  Why?  Were we spending the night with each other?  No, he just thought it would be a funny goof.  What's funny about that?  No, he just thought it would be a 202 fugitive.  Yeah, but there's nothing funny about this, Bobo.  Really?  You could be hurt.  We're worried.  Really?  Well, the fugitive isn't harming anybody. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Well, we have detectives on it.  We've made a couple of calls to the police department because we're actually very worried  that you're being injured.  Yeah, Bobo, actually, we've got a couple of detectives waiting here at SiriusXM to question  you because this has got us all very concerned.  Managers are very concerned over this.  So we're going to talk to you.  They might have to bring you downtown and discuss this with you.  So be prepared.  Since you know what the fugitive looks like, we'll have you give a description, maybe draw 
[01:04:30]  one of those composite drawings or something like that.  Okay.  Well, the guy...  Who is this?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Who are we talking to?  You're talking to Bobo.  Okay.  Oh.  Hey, Bobo, could you do us a favor?  Yeah.  On the count of three, I want both of you to go, uh, uh, we love the O&A show.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good idea.  That'll be a good promo for when, uh, you guys come in. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, that.  So on the count of three...  The fugitive isn't coming in with me.  No, no, no, no, no.  Right now, over the phone, I'm going to go one, two, three, and then both of you at the  same time go, we love the O&A show.  And then we're going to play that, okay?  Okay.  All right, ready?  Three.  All right.  One, two, three.  We love the O&A show.  I...  Wait a minute.  Fugitive, I didn't hear Bobo. 
[01:05:30]  It's a bit difficult for him to speak on the same phone at the same time.  No, no, just hold the phone up in front of both of you, right?  And then I'll go one, two, three, and both of you at the same time go, we love the O&A show,  so we can hear both of us.  You know, watch, watch me and Opie will do it.  Watch this.  One, two, three.  We love the O&A show.  Okay?  Or that.  Yes.  See that?  See how that sounds, Bobo?  We need that for the promo. 
[01:06:00]  So, both of you, hold the phone in front of both of you, and I'll count to three.  You ready?  All right.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Well, I want to hear both of you say, we love the O&A show.  Okay.  One, two, three.  We love the O&A show.  We love the O&A show.  Um, that was a bad connection.  I think I heard it, but I couldn't really hear Bobo.  I want to hear both together.  Yeah, your timing was really off for some reason. 
[01:06:30]  No, guys, that, no, no.  I think that was just an echo on the phone.  Oh, okay.  It wasn't an echo?  Yeah, he must be in a weird cell area.  But can you do that again, Bobo?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's have you in the future to say that, because I think it's just a weird echo thing that's  happening.  Yeah, well, make sure it sounds good so we can record it.  Okay, ready?  Ready?  One, two, three.  I love the O&A show.  But that was only the fugitive again.  It was me. 
[01:07:00]  He's finding it difficult, because he's trying to pay attention to the bus stop right now.  Wait, he's paying attention to the bus stop?  And I want to make sure that the fugitive doesn't miss the stop.  You're saying he wants to make sure the fugitive doesn't miss the stop.  Yeah.  Who does?  No, the fugitive wants to make sure I don't miss the stop.  Okay, so I'll just do it real quick, though.  You're probably in a light or something, so do it real quick.  Yeah, here we go.  Both of you.  Same time.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  I love the O&A show. 
[01:07:30]  We can't hear Bobo.  I'm not convinced.  I can't hear you, Bobo.  We love the O&A show.  But then where's the fugitive?  Yeah.  All right, one last time.  One last time.  And I want to hear both of you's goddammit, okay?  Yeah, because we're starting to think you might be lying, Bobo.  Come on.  Ready?  One, two, three.  We love the O&A show.  All right, that's it. 
[01:08:00]  Now I heard the ball thing.  It's okay.  All right, Bobo, be prepared.  We got a detective waiting to question you as soon as you get here.  Yeah.  And we got detectives outside the building, so hopefully maybe we could, you know, grab the fugitive.  Apprehend that fugitive.  Right, right.  So don't worry, Bobo.  You're safe.  What stop are you getting off on?  Yeah, the detectives want to know.  They're out there right now.  What stop?  He's getting, we're getting off at the bus. 
[01:08:30]  It's being stopped.  It's just right by Avenue, the America's, the short walk.  All right.  Well, you're both getting off the bus?  No, I'm just getting off.  All right.  So they'll be there waiting to arrest the fugitive, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, that's not what we've heard.  Yeah.  I got an email saying he intended to harm you.  Yeah, the NYPD is big time involved.  That's why they're involved in it now. 
[01:09:00]  So the description we have so far of the fugitive is he's wearing an O&A shirt and a Mets hat.  Right.  No, no, that's what, that's what, that's what I'm wearing.  Oh, that's what Bobo's wearing.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I didn't understand.  We gave the cops the description of the fugitive is wearing an O&A shirt.  Yes, and a Mets hat.  A Mets hat.  Oh.  At this point, the cops don't care.  They want to question both guys.  Yeah, they want to question you, too, about him.  And what sucks, man, I hope you could explain yourself, Bobo, because you don't want to  spend the whole weekend in jail. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  That will suck.  It happened to Jimmy once with the voyeur.  Yeah, I have an alibi.  Very scary.  So hopefully you can explain yourself this whole thing.  I remember listening to that back when I was in high school.  Yeah, whatever.  All right, listen.  All right, Bobo, get here soon, all right?  All right, no problem.  I'll be there soon.  Can you listen to us after you hang up or no?  No, unfortunately, like me, the fugitive does not have an N.O. 
[01:10:00]  All right, all right, because we wanted to give you some maybe, I don't know, some secret  signals, if you know what I mean.  Maybe we should give the fugitive an N.O. so he can listen.  No, the fugitive is saying that fugitive just told me they should give me an N.O.  Oh, really?  Why did the fugitive say they should give you an N.O.?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do you think Bobo should be able to, me, should be able to listen on the phone? 
[01:10:30]  Bobo, I just got a note from Kenny.  You know Kenny's a detective, right?  Yeah.  It says if Bobo is friends with a fugitive, Kenny said he's an accessory and co-conspirator  to grand larceny.  Oh, damn it.  So there could be a major problem here when you arrive.  I'm not the guy.  My stop is next, so I've got to hang up now.  All right, we'll see you and your jizz in a little bit.  Tell the fugitive we're going to send him an N.O. 
[01:11:00]  All right, he said send it to my address.  Why did he say that?  Put the fugitive on the phone.  Yeah, let's talk to the fugitive.  Well, we want to give it to you.  Yeah.  Well, I don't have use for it.  No, you can listen to our show and everything. 
[01:11:30]  We want you to listen to the show.  Yeah.  Because we need to be in contact with you, and you need to listen to what we're saying,  so I'd rather you have it than Bobo.  You know what I mean?  Well, darn, I'm both-handed.  Yeah.  Well, it'll be sent to Bobo.  Is the driver yelling at you?  Yeah, I dropped off the guy already.  All right, you're off the bus? 
[01:12:00]  Yes, I'm off the bus.  Okay, we'll see you in a little bit.  Well, where's Bobo?  Oh, no, Bobo's off.  I just sent Bobo off the bus.  And are you off the bus?  You just said you were off the bus.  Yeah, you said you were off the bus.  You're lying.  What happened?  I'm not lying.  I just got off for a second to hand Bobo the bag.  Why wouldn't you hand it to him on the bus? 
[01:12:30]  They're calling him.  I don't know.  I just want to hand it to him on his way out.  But why didn't you hand it to him on the bus?  I had to make sure he had his umbrella, too.  Okay, put the bus driver on the phone right now.  Yeah, we want to hear something from the bus driver.  My bus driver refused to speak.  Let me hear him.  Say something to him.  Yeah, let's hear the bus driver say something, Mugitive. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, we have to be convinced.  Yeah, we don't believe you.  Yeah.  Ask the bus driver, where is the next stop, and hold the phone up so we can hear him say.  Yeah, that's a good idea. 
[01:13:30]  That's a question.  All right.  I actually just, I actually got off the bus.  You did?  Yeah.  Why would you do that, a fugitive?  I thought it would be a better idea to just follow Bobo and help him carry the bag.  I thought you handed it to him right now.  He's got it.  Yeah, what happened?  You are lying.  Everyone's lying.  Well, the fugitives sometimes lie. 
[01:14:00]  Fair enough.  All right, the fugitives sometimes lie.  Let's get them upstairs.  Yeah.  All right, fugitive.  Thank you.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  Yeah, we'll see you in a few minutes.  The NYPD is waiting for you.  All that fugitive ain't got to be going.  Yeah, he's just dropping Bobo off at the field.  All right, we get it.  We get it.  Enjoy your inno, too.  We're going to give you an inno.  Right.  All right, you will, you will, you will, like, Bobo will hand it to me. 
[01:14:30]  He is the only contact, he is the direct contact with the fugitives.  Look at Robin Jersey goes, the fugitive, Harrison Ford with a head injury.  All right, regarding Bobo.  And then the other one by Rob.  He's like the retarded Kaiser.  Kaiser, so say.  So say, right.  All right, Bobo, thank you. 
[01:15:00]  We'll see you in a few minutes.  Oh, don't let me put Bobo on the phone?  Of course.  Yeah, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be there.  I'll be there in a little bit.  I'll be there in a little bit.  All right, so how come you handed, why did you have to help Bobo carry something?  Oh, no, this is Bobo.  Yeah, he's having a very big.  All right, Bobo, Bobo, you got to get your story straight because we really do have a detective up here and they really want to talk to you, okay?  Big time.  Big time.  Well, anyway, as I said before, the fugitive. 
[01:15:30]  No, Bobo.  I got to hand him the email.  No, Bobo, we have a detective that's bringing you in a room as soon as you get here and they're going to talk to you.  Get your shit together, okay?  We'll see you soon.  All right, no problem.  All right.  I got to hang up.  All right, there goes Bobo.  It's the fucking greatest thing.  By the way, Bobo doesn't, he thinks we don't know.  Yeah, he really does think that we have no clue.  But won't one of his friends call him or text him with this? 
[01:16:00]  Friends?  But, you know, make sure he's safe.  You never know.  Yeah, okay.  We'll keep it at that for you.  Hey, wait a minute.  Good point, good point.  Do people like the fugitive or people loving the fugitive?  Oh, they hate it.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  You need to know who to.  Hey, they really hate it.  I think we did that for ourselves and a few people out there.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Are we going to stop?  Are we going to continue?  I'll continue.  Of course.  You annoy everybody.  I saw a lot of Zs. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, the fugitive rules.  He could not want us more to give him the, you know, to give to the fugitive.  Right.  You should give it to Bobo.  Can I tell you how much I fucking, all I want to do until fucking noon is talk to the fugitive  motherfucker.  I know.  He's great.  Fugitive fucking is the best thing ever.  We got some ideas, by the way.  So, keep listening.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy, what are we promoting today?  I have two gigs, Stress Factory, Wednesday the 25th, both.

We love the ONA show. 
[01:17:30]  Little Radiohead.  Nice.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Rich Voss in studio.  Oh.  Well, if you're going to sit there, you might as well fucking do some radio with us.  How are you doing, Rich?  I go, Rich Voss in studio.  He goes, me?  How are we supposed to do radio if you're just sitting in the chair?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You bag of shit.  Are you cranky today?  Bag of shit.  Look, I'm sorry.  Are you upset today?  He just called you a bag of shit. 
[01:18:00]  Why are you dying?  Somebody did.  And you're asking if I'm cranky.  I reiterate it.  If I was a bag of shit, I'd be on your chest.  Shut your mouth.  No, I'm fucking tired.  It's time to get away for a little bit.  Just a little bit.  A little relaxation.  Go play golf somewhere.  I want to.  No, I'm going down to...  I'm going down there for a little bit.  Way down, though.  Where it's warm.  Way down.  I was in Las Vegas two weeks ago.  It was great, man.  It's always great in Las Vegas.  It's beautiful.  What do you do in Vegas if you're not drinking or gambling? 
[01:18:30]  Gambling, really?  Obviously golfing, but...  Playing golf and just performing.  Yeah, there's really not a lot to do.  It's like fucking...  It's going to be tough for you.  It's so depressing because you see these fat people on their little fucking scooters.  Yeah.  Just, you know, they're losing so much.  I saw one lady.  She lost so much, she just threw off, took her scooter.  She's fucking crawling on the floor like a fat snail.  You're going to have to pawn this lady.  They're losing up.  They're sitting there.  And they got fucking oxygen on them.  And they're just putting everything they own. 
[01:19:00]  And they're not even playing the right games.  They're playing slots.  Just feeding the machine.  Which is the biggest sucker bet in the casino is a slot.  You know, play craps or something.  Be a man.  Sucker cock to play fucking to gamble.  You know what I mean?  That's right.  I sold a necklace once at the casino.  A gold necklace right off my fucking neck to some dude, man.  Just kept gambling, baby.  You are a pisser, man.  How much did you get for it?  It was like...  Back then, I think I got $150.  It was like a $700, $800 necklace, huh?  Did you do well with that money?  That fucking money went so quick.  It was unbelievable.  How mad were you after the money was? 
[01:19:30]  We were in the fucking bathroom with the valet arguing for free razors so we could shave.  Because it was like the next morning.  And we go to the guy.  We didn't have a dollar to give him for his razor or something.  You know, the valet.  We go, just give us the fucking razor.  What's the big deal?  And some, you know, deuce in there.  You know, it's his whole fucking life.  And we just wanted to wash up our pits and, you know, shave and stuff.  And they kind of basically say, get the fuck out.  Where is that?  God, it was back when the casinos were just all opening down. 
[01:20:00]  It wasn't resorts.  It was another one.  I see.  Yeah, I pull up in my car and I had no corner panel at all.  It was taken.  Corner panel was ripped off so you could see inside the truck.  And we pull up at valet in this fucking car.  There's no corner panel.  Like fucking a couple hundred bucks each.  Me and my friend, we're going to go, yeah, we're going to hit it big.  Like that, the fucking money went.  I'm selling shit off my neck.  It was fucking hard.  How mad were you after you sold that and then you lost the money?  How annoyed was it?  I mean, I was already beaten down anyhow.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  It's just another fucking over.  It was just weighing me down to begin with.  Is there anything worse than that drive back from AC when you have no money, when everything's gone?  Uh, it's so depressing.  It's so, you know, you...  Have you driven back from AC depressed?  I've gambled where I've got in the car and I'm just like, tears are coming down my eyes.  I'm drunk.  I'm so depressed.  I mean, at least with fucking...  Oh, shit.  With drugs, you had that, you know, you got high for...  I mean, you get kind of high when you're gambling, you feel the high and stuff, but it's so being in, you get home to nothing, you know? 
[01:21:00]  I was...  I lost.  You just lose.  Do you replay what happened?  Like, if only I had a fucking king.  Well, oh, yeah.  No, with craps.  There was a lady who had dice like a month ago.  Yeah!  Four hours and 40 minutes, she held the dice.  Four hours and 40 minutes.  Did you play gambling or no?  No, no.  I played Mega Millions like once every couple months.  I don't even play the numbers anymore. 
[01:21:30]  So this lady had the dice for four hours and 40 minutes without crapping out.  Wow!  Do you know how much money you could possibly make?  I fucking...  I've had the dice.  I've thrown...  First of all, when I was with my ex-wife in Aruba, I had the dice.  I'm on a fucking roll.  I got money all over the place.  And I'm fucking hitting numbers.  Boom.  Money's coming in.  Right?  I'm on vacation.  And I'm fucking throwing the dice.  And my ex-wife comes up and she grabs my arm and goes,  Why don't we do something?  I go, You fucking just touched my arm? 
[01:22:00]  Jinxed.  Seven out.  Yeah.  Fucking seven.  She jinxed you.  So I fucking lose.  I'm depressed on vacation.  We get home from Aruba.  I want a divorce.  Now you fucking tell me?  A week earlier, before we went to Aruba, you couldn't have told me this?  One time I was gambling at one of the fucking Indian casinos.  I'm on a table and I fucking...  I'm throwing...  Or someone's throwing...  I got all this money and they crapped out and I went fucking through my arm,  something like that.  And right behind me was a waitress with a tray of drinks. 
[01:22:30]  And the whole fucking thing went flying in the air.  Why'd your wife want a divorce?  Were you a dick to her after she touched your arm and you crapped out?  Well, I was a dick to her.  I'm a dick to everybody.  I was a dick to her from the beginning.  But she said I wanted...  I got home.  A friend of mine, his wife, passed away.  I get back from Aruba.  Then I go to the wake and I get home.  She goes, I want a divorce.  The fuck?  You know?  Spread this shit out a little bit.  My gambling loss, the wake, the fucking divorce. 
[01:23:00]  Cut me a break.  When I was betting on sports, one week I lost 14 out of 16 basketball games.  It's almost impossible.  Yeah, that's harder to do than winning.  14 out of 16.  I couldn't win, man.  College basketball?  It was everything.  Just all together.  Okay.  How mad would you get an athlete when they would fuck up and you had money on the game?  I was my two daughters.  They were like four and two or three.  And they were both in the hospital with asthma attacks.  So I'm sitting in the hospital room watching.  And it was Ohio State versus UNLV back when Tark was the coach and had Anthony Hardaway and all these. 
[01:23:30]  And whatever the spread was, it was like UNLV by 16 or whatever.  So I got back then.  I had like 200 on the game.  So it's down to two seconds.  And fucking UNLV is on the foul line.  If they make one, I push.  If he makes both fouls, I win.  If he misses, I lose.  Who can miss two fouls? 
[01:24:00]  Who the fuck?  So the kids are in there and I yell, fuck, at the top of my lungs in the hospital.  It's going to go seven games.  All the nurses come running.  I'm going, fuck.  That might have been a guy getting paid to miss two if they didn't cover the spread.  Oh, yeah.  Back then, they said Tark was, you know.  So it's just, I don't know what God will want you to think.  Is he a good free throw shooter?  Who?  The guy.  Obviously not.  Yeah, true.  Obviously not.  I mean, was it like a shack on the line? 
[01:24:30]  Because when it comes down to that, though, I mean, come on.  They're fucking with you.  Oh, yeah.  That's terrible.  Two points.  You just sit there going, after all that, it comes down to this.  It was three seconds ago.  He gets fouled.  Like, I knew I lost because I'm not going to spread.  And then he gets fouled.  I'm going, oh, fuck.  At least I'm going to push.  He's going to make one.  Yeah.  What's push mean?  Just break even, basically.  I don't pay you.  You don't pay me.  Yeah, you pay the vigor, whatever it is.  My daughter had her game.  I was at her college game the other night.  Had 12 points and six rebounds, man.  She was on fucking fire. 
[01:25:00]  What was that?  Double-double.  She's in college, you learn?  My oldest one, yeah.  When's the youngest one in college?  Next year, she goes.  This year, she's a senior.  So, Anthony, if you want her number.  All right.  She's graduating.  But, you know, whatever.  It's just gambling.  You asked me about Vegas.  I could talk about this fucking gambling forever, man.  Yeah.  All these games, man.  Here's the lock, folks.  The fucking Giants this week.  They have to win.  They lost four in a row.  So, you're still gambling.  You're just not playing.  No, I'm not.  I know. 
[01:25:30]  But you're still watching the action.  Yeah.  So, you're so close to gambling.  Who are they playing?  Falcons, I think.  I would put every penny on the Falcons.  Are you sure?  Oh, because I do.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking mush.  Oh, my God.  Are you known as a mush?  What are you kidding me?  Just from talking.  If you're chicken, not mush mouth.  Yeah.  If you're fucking selling your gold chain.  You probably actually thought, like, you suck one cock. 
[01:26:00]  I make some money.  No, not from gambling.  That's hard.  You can't.  Like, it's different with drugs.  Yeah.  If you think gambling's addictive.  We have to go to the phones, man.  You hit on something.  Rich in Buffalo.  Rich.  Morning, guys.  Hey.  So, Rich, you're the modern-day mush, huh?  Wait, hold.  Hello.  Loved you in the bronze tail.  Anyway, I got a story.  Years ago, me and my girl were in Vegas, and I'm playing craps, and this girl's rolling 
[01:26:30]  for about 45 minutes.  So, I'm up, like, four grand.  My girl finds me out of nowhere.  She's like, hey, you didn't lose yet?  Absolute next roll, seven out.  I wanted to light her fucking hair on fire.  I was nuts.  But do you lose everything?  Well, you have a lot of time coming out there.  I lost whatever was on the table.  I had about 800 on the table left, but, I mean, I was up four grand, but she comes up  to me like the fucking black plague, and seven out, I'm done.  The core.  So, the pit boss comes up to me, and she goes, sir, you know, can I get you anything?  And I'm like, yeah, give me a fucking map to the roof, because I'm about to fucking throw 
[01:27:00]  my bra off.  I was fucking pissed out of my skull.  I've told people that.  Laws and casinos are a nightmare.  I've told people that if you walk up to the table while I'm playing blackjack, and instantly  the shoe changed, I turn around and I go, look, you gotta get the fuck out of here.  You gotta go.  You gotta go.  You guys leave.  Just leave.  Oh, yeah.  One of the dealers actually grabbed my bra, and he told her, he goes, listen, he goes,  people who play craps are real superstitious.  You cannot say shit to anybody. 
[01:27:30]  Like, she was clueless.  She was oblivious to everything.  I'd walk right up to you while you're playing craps.  Hey, it looks like you can't lose.  How about the people that throw the dice real hard, and they bounce all over the chips?  Like, they're fucking, like, throwing it like they're, you know what I mean, seven out.  Like, when a crap table's on fire, like, someone from the Klan is high-fiving Muslims, you know  what I mean?  Fucking, when a table's hot, fucking, people like Jews.  I mean, everything is fucking.  You're right, you're right.  And then once that table gets cold, you're like, fucking, easy with the dice, asshole. 
[01:28:00]  You know, you're yelling at people.  I've helped to yell at people.  Speaking of Jews, I got a good Jew joke for the morning that I'm punching out.  All right, let's hear it.  What did Hitler say to the black Jew?  Oh, my God.  Get to the back of the oven.  I'm out, punching out.  Oh, that's not even funny.  I don't get it.  Well, because, see, they, uh, with, um...  My God, man.  Yeah, the blackjack tables are the same way, though, because, like, when the dealer is  losing and everyone's winning, you're high-fiving people next to you. 
[01:28:30]  You're just like, oh, yeah, nice bed, yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it, oh, come on.  And people, like, get an ace, and you're pushing for them.  Come on, face card.  Yeah, get him a blackjack.  And then when the shoe's cold, you're just looking and going, why the fuck did he hit  that?  Did you hit that?  Why the fuck?  Did you split that shit, you fucking asshole?  Like Kenny Rogers said, you have to know what to hold them and know what to fold them,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Hi, Ted.  What's up?  Yes, Ted.  Are you a gambler, Ted?  I certainly am.  What's your game of, uh, choice? 
[01:29:00]  I prefer craps.  You're a crap player?  I'm a good dicer.  Yeah?  Yes.  What's your secret?  I like to roll them.  Roll the bones?  I always go for sevens.  Lucky number seven.  Is that a lucky number, Rich?  On the come out.  I don't even know what that means.  What's the come out?  Oh, what are you trying to do with your toothbrush?  What drips on your chin?  Jesus.  Hey, we got someone that bet on the same fucking basketball game, Rich. 
[01:29:30]  You can enjoy this one.  Mark in Oceanside.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  How you doing, Mac?  Rich, I know exactly the game you talked about in UNLV when Tark was a coach.  It was Greg Anthony on the free throw line.  My mother was stuck like five grand for the week.  He put it all on that game.  And he went to the free throw line.  There was no time left at 9 o'clock.  And like you said, all he had to do was hit one or two to push.  And he missed both of them.  It was unbelievable.  I don't know exactly what you were talking about.  It was almost impossible.  Because Tark was, you know, they insinuated and they never charged him. 
[01:30:00]  But they said he was, you know, fixing or whether they do that with games, you know.  You're a college basketball coach in the Vegas area.  I mean, how are you not involved?  That's true.  Do you remember if the ball went like, do-do-do-ing off the rim?  Or was it, did it almost go in?  No, this guy will tell you.  The ball went off the back and the second one was a brick.  A brick.  Yeah.  I think Greg Anthony was all right from the line, too, right?  Yeah, he was fine.  He played for the Knicks for a while.  No, I know all that.  Yeah, because I used to be a Knicks fan until the last decade. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, it was correct.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Someone can relate to the pain.  Well, there's another one.  Oh, let's go to Pat in Richmond.  Pat.  Yeah, I just wanted to let Rich know that he's a horse's dick because Anthony Hardaway never  played for UNLV.  You're such a big dummy.  I hope you choke on him.  Really?  Really?  You think so?  He never played for UNLV, you fucking idiot?  That's it?  Well, I don't know.  Now we're going to look it up because I don't even know. 
[01:31:00]  I don't even know if it was Anthony Hardaway.  It doesn't really matter.  You don't know who he is?  No, I know.  It doesn't matter who was at the free throw line.  I said it could have been him.  And Anthony Hardaway did play for, well, maybe he didn't, but whatever.  It was one of them.  And who would get so mad to say, I hope you choke on something for making a mistake about  an Afro-American basketball player?  Who would really care about that?  Afro-American.  Afro.  That's a bunch of this, Coleman Negro.  Jesus.  But what I'm saying is, why would that kid get so upset? 
[01:31:30]  Exactly.  Charlie in Tampa.  Charlie.  Hey, boys.  What's going on, man?  Hey, man.  I got a great story.  My buddy wins $19,000 over a period of time with a bookie.  So the bookie's like, look, let's meet at the bank.  We get to the safe deposit box.  I'll give you the money.  So the kid goes there, gets an envelope, goes back to his vehicle, going down the road.  DTs pull him over.  They're like, give us the stuff in the bag.  They cuff him to the steering wheel.  They take the $19,000.  They leave this kid in the middle of the frigging boulevard, cuffed to a wheel. 
[01:32:00]  DTs are detectives?  No, they were like the muscle of the fucking bookie.  Oh, wow.  So they set him up.  What's DTs stand for, though?  Detectives.  Oh, they pose these detectives.  Oh, okay.  Got you.  Yeah, they pose their detectives, and they cuffed him to the steering wheel, and they took  the fucking money.  You ain't winning that much.  I know.  Isn't that crazy?  It's like fucking Pesci in a casino.  He wouldn't pay the people.  If he met at the bank, he should have just opened an account right there. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Put it in the bank right there.  Yeah.  They explain to the IRS what you put, $19,000 in cash out of an envelope.  Yeah.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, Voss, is there anything that you have a tendency to win at ever?  Yes, life.  Oh.  Oh, well, I mean, if you work out a little bit, you'll make a shitload of the horse races.  See, because...  But I don't even have big teeth anymore.  See, that's kind of a...  Let me see.  These are temporary, so... 
[01:33:00]  Come on.  They're temporary.  Yeah, they're almost normal.  Yeah, and these are the temps.  Yeah.  That's where the real ones get put in.  Why didn't you get normal ones to begin with?  Why the big fucking horse teeth?  I never had big horse teeth.  Dude, come on.  When we first met you, I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with this guy?  Your teeth were ridiculous.  No one told you?  Close to you?  Yes.  No.  I mean, you know, just the fucking...  I guess the dentist got paid by fucking, you know, square inch or something.  I don't fucking know.  They look good, though. 
[01:33:30]  Well, these are temporary.  Wait till the real ones get put in.  Oh, we can't wait.  Excuse me?  We can't wait.  We can't wait.  It's going to be a big day.  She wants to throw a party?  Yeah, a new tooth party.  We'll all have rock candy, because I won't be scared to eat it.  What can't you eat right now?  What can't I eat right now?  Apples?  I can eat anything.  There's nothing I can't eat.  Pussy?  Yeah, but who wants to?  You're married.  Fucking old.  Oh, my.  What's wrong with fucking...  You don't lick your wife's vagina and ass?  What's wrong with you?  Once in a while, I'll eat her fucking pussy, you know.  You eat her ass? 
[01:34:00]  What's wrong with...  No, she won't let me eat.  I asked her the other night.  I go, do you want me to eat my...  Eat my ass?  I go, do you want me to eat my ass?  I go, do you want me to eat my ass?  And she goes, no, because I got hemorrhoids.  And she's scared that I had fucking hit him with little punching bags and stuff with my  tongue.  I start going like that.  All right.  I fucked her good the other night.  Did you?  Oh, yeah?  You gave her a good one?  Yeah, it was fucking good.  I lasted, too, man.  I'm telling you.  You fucked her good when you married her.  How come...  What is it about a hotel room that you have to jerk off in a hotel room everywhere? 
[01:34:30]  So, I was on the road.  Like, I jerk off so much when I'm on the road.  I don't even know why.  Do you use your computer?  No, I use my hand, you fucking asshole.  That would fucking hurt.  Yeah, I just sit and whack my cock.  I got it.  I know.  But I try to add more to it.  No, Rich, it was a good line.  You should just let it be.  All right.  How am I going to hit the cue?  All right.  All right.  I get it.  I'm going to hump the escape.  Do you look on the computer when you jerk off on the road?  Or even when my girlfriend...  I'm fucking alright.  I look on the computer. 
[01:35:00]  Yes, I love the computer.  Why do you always see your eyes pop out?  Because he gets excited when we talk about porn.  No, I'm not being excited.  I don't...  My eyes aren't...  I'm not acting.  See, he's a sex addict.  That's why I know he banged my ex-wife.  We know that, but...  No.  Did you bang Rich's ex-wife?  No.  That's what we talked about on the phone.  But I let it go because we were separated.  There's nothing I can do.  I don't know.  You really believe that he did?  Not really, but he's a sex addict.  You know, like a Coke...  Like, I was a Coke addict, alright?  So, to get high...  Shut up!  Like, if he was my best friend and he fell asleep, I would have stole some of his Coke. 
[01:35:30]  It's different.  Yeah.  Oh, it is?  Stealing Coke, though, is so different.  I could jerk off and do that.  I never banged yours for it.  Stealing Coke is different than banging someone's fucking chick.  Yeah.  You know.  It is?  Everyone stole someone's Coke.  What the hell?  Everyone did?  Oh, I felt guilty.  We were opening up for the band Blotto upstate.  They used to do that.  Ah, I want to be a lifeguard.  Two bands you never heard of.  Exactly.  One hit wonder.  And the guy was nice enough to share a little Coke with us in the dressing room. 
[01:36:00]  And then, when he went out on stage, we saw him put it in his jacket pocket that was  hanging up on the back of the door.  And the second they hit the stage, it's like, you know no one's coming back because  they're on stage.  We grabbed that fucking, what was left of the eight ball and just fucking did it all  off.  And then left?  No.  We stayed.  We don't know what happened to it.  I don't know.  It wasn't us.  As you're grinding your teeth, we don't know what happened to it.  Then why are you fucking washing the bathroom here in the venue? 
[01:36:30]  I mean, I'm sure I told these stories, but I copped this girl and ate the Coke one night,  her and Dave, and they said, you know, just slip it under our door.  Take, you know, so I slipped under the door and I kept going back at like every fucking  hour with a hanger and I pulled it back out.  And I kept going back out and I go get some fucking ammonia and smoke a half a gram and  put it back until there was nothing left. 
[01:37:00]  Another hanger and you kept pulling it back in an empty bag.  It was like nothing left.  How'd you explain to them what happened?  Holy shit.  Huh?  I, by the end of the night, there was, by the time I got up, they fucking, there was  no Coke and I just made some excuse.  I gave the guy the money and he's going to bring it or whatever.  Who the fuck knows?  Was the guy going to bring it?  No.  Fuck.  There was no guy.  My friend, John, I did it so many times.  Like he goes, I told, I know how to tell the story.  He fucking said, you know, let me get an eighth and we'll get high tonight. 
[01:37:30]  And, you know, he cut it into three grams and a half a gram and we did a gram and he  was going to sell the other two and a half and get his money back to 250 bucks, right?  That always works well.  So we smoke a gram and now he has five half gram packets and he hides them and falls asleep.  And I don't know how I found them.  You searched everywhere all night long.  I kept sneaking, taking a half a gram out as he's sleeping.  And I go to the store, buy ammonia, come back, cook the half a gram, throw the ammonia out. 
[01:38:00]  Why would you throw the ammonia out?  So I wouldn't have any more ammonia to cook anymore.  I wouldn't steal any more.  You know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to cook anymore.  I wouldn't.  So I made five different trips to the fucking store buying ammonia and I'm walking in.  My fucking face is all wired, my teeth.  And the guy's looking at me.  I keep, this is my fifth trip buying ammonia.  I go, I have a cleaning service, right?  What time was it? 
[01:38:30]  It's like four.  Four in the morning.  Right, of course.  So I smoked all.  I wish I knew you then.  I smoked all this Coke.  And all of a sudden I'm sitting in my friend's house.  You know, we're at some other guy's house.  He's rich.  I'm drinking straight vodka at like fucking sun up.  Right?  Trying to calm the edge down.  I hear someone in the room yell, fuck.  Right?  Oh, you know, it's, you know, it's up now.  Yeah, the jig's up.  And he walks downstairs and I first try to pretend I don't know what happened, but I'm sitting there. 
[01:39:00]  And I just said, oh yeah, I sold.  And then I walked.  You talk about walking home, losing money after a casino.  That walk home, it was Saturday morning.  I was doing comedy for like two years.  I hadn't, it was just, just the biggest empty feeling on the planet.  Why didn't you just leave?  Why'd you just stay there for him to wake up?  I was too wired to go home.  You know, I was too fucked up.  You're not thinking.  There's no sense.  Yeah, you're paying back.  I pay somehow. 
[01:39:30]  I don't fucking know if I paid him.  What the fuck?  I know drug dealers' money all over the place.  We still do, yeah.  We got a good observation here from Russ in Atlanta.  Russ.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Russ.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, Russ.  Hey, Rich.  Dummy.  You keep coming up with these stories, man.  You got all these coke addict friends falling asleep.  Hey, who the fuck has a coke addict friend that ever falls asleep?  You should have said, like, three days later I found this shit.  But you keep cogging me.  Is it the teeth?  You're still on the Novocaine or what? 
[01:40:00]  Huh?  What?  What are you doing, Rich?  Big deal.  People eventually fall asleep.  You think drug addicts stay up fucking nonstop, you fucking idiot?  Maybe they're crashing.  At some point, you have to crash.  You're having a lot of problems with that piece of bacon, aren't you?  A piece of pork roll.  What is it?  It's turkey bacon.  Is that turkey bacon?  That smells good.  It was trying to escape from his mouth.  You're having a tough time chewing that.  I understand.  It's an apple or something.  Yes.  That smells really good. 
[01:40:30]  Huh?  That smells good.  It does.  It smells like cock, doesn't it?  You want a bite?  You want a bite?  Well, all right.  Give me a bite on the other side.  We should take a break.  I think Bobo's being questioned about the future.  Oh, good.  Maybe we'll have an update on that after the break.  Oh, that'd be nice.  Rich, what are you promoting, buddy?  Oh, you know what?  This weekend, not this weekend, next weekend.  Next weekend, the comedy shop in Pinebrook, New Jersey, Route 16, the comedy shop, Friday  and Saturday.  Where's Route 16?  It's like, I don't know. 
[01:41:00]  Where's Pinebrook?  What?  In my map quest?  I don't know.  No, but you live in Jersey.  Well, you know, so do you.  You grew up in Jersey.  I haven't been there in many years.  I'm a man of the...  I'm a gentleman.  I'm a refined gentleman.  I enjoy museums.  Comedy shop, November 27th.  Where is Pinebrook?  How far?  Is it 10 minutes from the city or an hour and 40 minutes from the city?  Yeah, where is it close?  South Jersey or North Jersey?  No, it's North.  It's North.  Near where?  By Route 16.  Stop coughing.  Down in Jersey?  46.  46. 
[01:41:30]  Nice work, Lou.  Pinebrook.  Nice work, Jew.  This Saturday, too, at Stand Up New York.  I just told him I thought I didn't.  Why are you plugging Stand Up New York?  You don't get money there.  That's stupid of you.  Yeah, don't do that.  Next weekend at the comedy shop, Rich Voss, 16 Route 46 West, Pinebrook, New Jersey.  One show Friday and Saturday.  We'll continue.  Stay there.  Sam and Kenny ran in to give us an update.  Kenny, what?  Talk to the, I was going to say the fugitive, but talk to Bobo. 
[01:42:00]  Bobo.  About the fugitive, and the audio's coming in the next 15 or 20 minutes.  He was questioned.  This Bobo was questioned about the fugitive accessory.  And then we'll get Bobo in here a little later, too.  But the audio first, hopefully within the next 15, 20 minutes.  Got Rich Voss in studio.  Day before, we take a little break for Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  A little Thanksgiving breather.  A much-deserved break.  Jimmy, I noticed you were eating over there.  Having a banana.  Do you like movie popcorn? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, boy.  There's actually a huge study.  It's not bad for you.  They had always for years thought it was bad for you.  Yes.  And they're saying now that it's actually probably the same as having celery.  Yes, it is.  You guys want to learn about movie popcorn?  Oh!  Jimmy eats the banana, but pushes the back of his head down on it.  It fucking got hard watching it.  I know.  It was very exciting.  Do you still show people the picture of your penis?  Once in a while. 
[01:43:00]  It's fading away.  It's like fucking back to the future.  Why would you do that?  The image is just fading.  Yeah, just shrinking.  Yeah.  You want to learn about movie popcorn?  Yes, even though I did already from the news.  Why would you do that?  Yeah.  Oh, let me see that.  No.  You text me one.  Is that you?  My boss wanted to see his iPhone thing work.  He was with his wife at the comedy store, so I texted him a phone on my cock.  My wife goes, I recognize that.  That was a nice picture.  You were fucking solid, man.  Here they come. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, the morning mashup walking down the hall.  Morning mashup.  Is that my girl?  Is that my Latino?  No, she's a...  What is she?  Wop?  Oh, she's one of those Israelis.  Oh, yeah?  No, what is she?  Oh, an Israeli?  No, what is she?  She's from Islamabad.  Nicole, what are you?  What are you?  What are you?  Oh, she hates coming in here.  What's your background?  Ethnic background.  I'm like...  What's up, brother? 
[01:44:00]  My great-grandmys are from, like, Austria-Hungary.  Oh, really?  I'm a Jew, too.  Oh, me, too.  You are?  Yeah, we knew the Jew thing.  Yeah, but I don't know.  I just came out darker than the rest of my family.  Since the last two times we met, has my name came up in any conversation?  I dreamt about you once.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Wow.  It was hot.  I'm telling you.  Fuck.  God, I'd love to chase you through the woods with a hammer.  You are fucking so hot.  That's really romantic.  How come you're not married?  Are you, like...  I live with my boyfriend.  Oh, you do? 
[01:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  How long?  We moved in in August, but we've been together, like, a little over a year.  What does that faggot do?  He's a sales dude.  Trying to cock-block him a little bit?  Yeah.  He's a sales dude.  Sales dude.  Exciting.  Yeah, it's very exciting.  How tall is he?  He's 6'2".  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  Is he fat big or just tall big?  No, he's tall big.  Does he work out?  Yeah.  Oh, you like that?  He's him.  You like that in a guy?  No, I don't like you to be too chiseled.  I don't like you to be too chiseled.  I like a little mush.  Rich has abs. 
[01:45:00]  Is he white or you're trying to get even with somebody?  Rich, please.  Show your abs, right?  But do the whole thing, because he just doesn't show them.  He gets really excited.  Oh, dear.  You got a sweater, too, baby.  Look at that.  The hair is like that.  You can't see the abs because of all the fucking hair.  I should shave it.  I used to, but...  Well, wax it.  Don't shave it.  Wax it.  Wax my...  Yeah, we did Ryan for my show.  We did his back and his chest.  Well, you know, when I'm in my bathroom, I don't want to do a little radio bit on my  stomach, because it hurts if you fucking wax it. 
[01:45:30]  Can we duct tape some hair off your fucking...  Take a swat off of it?  Yeah, come on.  What?  Really?  Really?  That's never going to happen.  Really?  After seven years, now we're duct taping fucking hair off a nice...  What's that?  Oh, my plugs?  Really?  Now the four people aren't going to come?  Oh, darn.  You guys have a good weekend.  I have to go back into my show.  Good luck with your boyfriend.  Oh, yeah.  You got a show to do.  What happened?  Very lovely.  You got a show.  Sorry.  You know what's so nice about her?  Besides how good she looks, she seems like a nice person. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, shut up.  Yeah?  Jesus.  Enough with a nice person.  I'm a new man.  Really?  I'm a new man.  You're a new man.  All I want to do is compliment people.  I like how your hair is growing like that.  It doesn't feel good.  It feels long.  And I can't tell you the self-loathing I've been experiencing the last couple days.  Why?  Wow.  Why?  It just happened.  I think I'm probably...  Things are going good for you, Jimmy.  It doesn't matter.  The outsides don't fix the inside.  I'm probably manic depressive.  You think?  There's something very wrong with me.  Take the mirrors out of your house. 
[01:46:30]  God, Rich.  You're rocking.  That's exactly right.  Why don't you see a shrink and go on some medication?  I go.  I go once a week.  Medication.  No.  I knew he was going to say that.  She put me on stuff.  She goes, have you thought of it?  And I'm like, hey, it kills your sex drive.  But I'm not fucking with my mind, my creativity at all.  Yeah.  No.  You think it would?  Yes.  Wow.  You ever see somebody on medication?  They fucking...  They got the white shit in the corner of their mouth.  How you doing?  I'm good.  I've been eating apples.  I'm healthy.  And I feel really good. 
[01:47:00]  No.  Why would you waste any of my living with this?  You're 100% wrong, because...  Shut up.  If you're a fucking...  If you're doing a Thorazine shuffle somewhere, of course.  But if you're putting on something just to neutralize your whatever...  Like what?  I remember when I was on Paxil.  Exactly.  And look at you.  No.  Look, there's some medicine.  I fucking...  I was such an anxiety mess.  Well, you're pushing glasses back up onto your head.  Yeah, I like them like that.  Hurry!  What's going on with you?  You all right? 
[01:47:30]  Arr!  Are you on a pill or something?  All right?  An angry pill.  No.  Huh?  No, I'm not on a...  No.  You're angry Matt, right?  No napkins, Frank.  I was told to be, yeah.  You were told to be angry Matt?  Yeah.  We invented angry Matt.  You didn't invent angry Matt.  Ooh.  I know.  You're just angry.  I know.  It's based on the fact that you're actually angry all the time.  Are you on a little pill or something?  No.  You lost a lot of weight.  Are you bumming?  Good.  Yeah, what's going on with you?  What's the matter?  How'd you lose so much weight?  I've been working out, watching what I eat, cut out a lot of my bad habits over the past 
[01:48:00]  couple months.  You look great, man.  Thank you.  You lost a lot of fucking weight.  How much did you lose?  About 40 pounds.  Get the fuck out.  Yeah.  No, I mean leave.  Yeah.  No.  Come here.  Fuck.  Jesus.  I know.  What are you going to do?  Are the glasses too big for your head now because you lost all that weight?  They're just pieces of shit.  Can I see them?  Were you looking for broads?  Don't break them.  These are the only pair I have.  Oh, God.  Let me see them.  Don't give them to them.  I'm not going to.  40 pounds.  A lot.  Was it because of broads? 
[01:48:30]  Do you want some broads?  No, I just decided to make a change in my life for health reasons.  Do you impress girls by saying you work here with Opie and Anthony?  No.  No.  The guys with Bullets are impressive.  Dude, what happened to your shoulders?  Looks like a 1940s football player.  Wait, you lost weight and now you have like no shoulders.  I just noticed that.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine. 
[01:49:00]  My wrist.  He's such a good guy.  I like being physically inspected on the air.  No, we like this guy.  You've thinned down a lot.  He's not angry anymore.  His shoulders have really thinned out.  Yeah.  Why aren't you angry anymore?  Because you lost the weight and taking care of yourself?  No, I just catch up myself in my shitty little life.  Wait, what's that?  Oh, that guy.  What?  His name is Craig Robertson, the black guy from the office?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's on my flight.  I know him.  Yeah, he gets all the parts that Patrice O'Neal should be getting. 
[01:49:30]  He's supposed to get, but Patrice doesn't know how to play ball with these fucking Hollywood  people.  All those roles are Patrice O'Neal's roles.  He's so famous from the office now and everything.  And Patrice was with him in the fucking basement.  Wait, he's...  That guy fucking...  And I see him all the time.  And I always...  Like, I saw him.  I'm on the plane.  He goes, Jim.  And I'm looking at him.  And he's like, Craig Robertson.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  He's got to sell her a lot.  He was in Kevin Smith's movie there.  Okay.  And that could all be Patrice.  Yeah.  That's Patrice's role.  For real. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, Craig Robertson...  He's doing the Patrice story.  Come on.  I almost believed it.  Is he a funny comic?  I'm sure...  I've seen him.  I think I enjoyed what he did.  I remember what he did on stage.  I don't know.  He's...  He travels...  Like, sometimes he has, like, a band with him and stuff.  He fucking...  All right, Matt.  He was so good in...  What was the movie?  Pineapple Express or something?  Matt's just walking out.  It's so depressing.  His shoulders.  I think he's got his grandmother's shoulders.  Yeah, we're really bummed out by his shoulders.  Is there anything you can do?  Maybe start wearing pet? 
[01:50:30]  All right.  See you later.  Oh, yeah.  I fucking...  He's doing...  I'll plug him.  He's doing comics this weekend.  If you're in New York, Craig Robinson from The Office.  Why the fuck is...  Did we say no to him?  I don't think...  Did...  Really?  Yeah, because we're team Patrice O'Neal.  I'm telling you, all those roles are Patrice O'Neal's roles.  I didn't even realize that he came up.  That's not even a joke.  But Patrice is a self-destructive ass.  Right.  Chris Rock said it to him personally.  Yeah.  Chris Rock was in the studio and basically gave Patrice...  That's a piece of his mind.  I bet that guy walks in...  He's like, you should be a lot more famous than you are, but you fucking burn every fucking 
[01:51:00]  bridge.  I bet Craig Robinson walks in and is like, pleasure.  This is great.  I'm looking forward to doing this.  And Patrice is just like, let's get this shit over with.  I don't even know why I flew out here and shit.  But this shit roll, fuck you, fuck you.  Because Chris...  He opens his suitcase and goes, look at this new one.  Chris Rock told him.  He goes, that role was yours, the one that Chris cast.  Yeah.  I forgot which one it was.  It was on Everybody Hates Chris, the father. 
[01:51:30]  What are you kidding me?  All right, right, right.  Chris told him that.  Spike Lee called him.  And Patrice...  Yeah.  Spike Lee loved Patrice.  Nah, it's not enough money for you to hold me.  Okay.  Spike Lee used to come to the shows at Boston, Caroline.  Maybe it's a stepping stone, you dummy.  Spike Lee, Puff Daddy, he turned Puff Daddy down to host, what do you call it, HBO Puff Daddy's Bad Boys?  Did he really turn it down?  Yeah, Patrice, they wanted him to host it. 
[01:52:00]  Not enough cash.  I mean, it was ridiculously not...  I'm sure, yeah, yeah, but...  It was really low, and you know...  I hosted Down and Dirty for a quarter of the money per episode that my manager said it would be because the head of HBO changed, and they weren't going to do it.  Uh-huh.  So they got there to do it, and my managers were producers on it.  They made more money producing it than I did hosting it.  Jesus.  What happened to that show?  I thought they were going to do another round.  No, they should have.  They actually did very well with viewers.  Yeah, so what the fuck? 
[01:52:30]  They just, to be honest, I think the humor was too rough for them.  I think so.  I really think so, yeah.  They turned me down and said, because I did Comedy Central.  But that's true, though.  That's true.  When we were booking for fucking Down and Dirty, I had very little say over a lot of the comedians.  I could suggest, but a lot of guys, they turned down because of Comedy Central.  They're like, we don't want the same...  Not that they don't like them, but they're like, if they can get them there, why would they come...  That's so ridiculous.  HBO, just fucking...  It was a weird process, yeah.  Hey, a lot of people were calling in.  They love Craig Robertson. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's very talented.  We like him, too.  We just made the observation that that was Patrice O'Neal's stuff.  He's here in town, and he's at the comics this Friday, Saturday.  I was going to invite him on, but then I'm like, I didn't, because I went back to my seat  and fucking fell asleep, and then he just left after that.  I didn't see him for the rest of the flight.  I should invite him on.  Hey, let's do the movie popcorn thing, though.  It's a quickie.  A lot of people are going to go to the movies this weekend.  And quite honestly, most of the people out there don't even give a shit how bad the  popcorn is.  But kind of interesting, though.  But wow.  I didn't realize it was this bad.  I didn't either. 
[01:53:30]  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater, and what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?

Checking out the latest movie at the theater, and what's a flick without a snack?  Sure.  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  I know!  What, Jimmy?  What?  A chocolate-covered hysterectomy!  No?  I haven't seen those.  At the session counter.  Let's just try this again. 
[01:54:30]  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  True.  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  I have the answer!  Yes, Jim Norton.  A foreskin filled with smarties!  I like that.  No?  Yeah.  No?  Did you do that one?  No.  Oh, God.  Rich, you might have one?  Our bitch.  Rich has one, everyone.  Rich has one, everyone.  Rich has one.  It's the great American pastime.

I got a couple of ideas.  Well, let's hear.  As the virus makes his way down the hall, or he's fired, let's have Rich Voss do one. 
[01:55:30]  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  Oh, me now?  Want to be a horse's ass?  He's the worst.  What was your first clue?  Come on, man.  Then it might be you.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know, buddy.  You gotta listen to when she says, what's your favorite snack?  But a lot of times they go like this in studio.  They point.  Like, Man Cow will go. 
[01:56:00]  Fuck Man Cow in the fucking ass.  Why don't you go to a Man Cow show?  I'm joking.  You fucking traitor.  You fucking traitor.  Thank you, J-E-W.  What, are you going to go there and talk politics?  Because all of a sudden he's into politics instead of shock radio?  You do what?  I just do his name out to fucking get a reaction.  Does he point, really?  I don't fucking know.  I never did a show once.  Why would you do his show?  They made me.  They made me.  Yeah, you got some fucking traitor, man.  Oh, really?  I'm a traitor?  Yeah.  I'm not loyal to this fucking show.  Give me my golf club back. 
[01:56:30]  I broke it, actually.  Not the new one?  I got mad.  No, you didn't.  Ask Boris.  You didn't break it.  Ask Boris.  You follow Boris?  B-Golf on Twitter?  Oh.  He's giving me lessons.  He'll tell you where the fucking golf club is.  Not the square-headed one.  Yeah, I fucking hated that square fucking thing.  Well, where's the head to it?  It's in the woods somewhere.  No fucking way.  Well, when you fucking take a driver to a tree, the head tends to go flying. 
[01:57:00]  You don't get that mad.  Ask Boris.  In front of your fucking coach?  Ask Boris.  Oh, man.  Because he said that club's retarded, too.  Did he really?  The square-stupid fucking driver.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do you know how many pros use that on Twitter?  All right, do one, Rich.  Okay.  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  Hold on.  Hold on.  A lot of times, we'll bring our own snack.

I'll do Rich's.  You got one in?  Yeah, I'll do Rich's.  You're going to do one as Rich's?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.

Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movie?  Shut the tape!  I like to bring mashed potatoes and a steak and perhaps a glass of wine.  You get all that in the theater.  I certainly do.  No, Al.  That's very funny.  I have a satchel. 
[01:58:30]  Rich, you got one?  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  Fuck.  My favorite snack to order when I go to the theater is...  Reese's teethies.  Oh, shit.  Oats.  Oats.  Do you really got one, Rich?  No, we bring, you know...  All right, let's just play the milk duds. 
[01:59:00]  No, I don't even like that.  Where's the virus?  Get your teeth out.  I don't know.  Get the virus in there.  Is the virus really outside?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I got one.  You came down the hall with me.  You got one?  Yeah, I think I got one.  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  16-year-old cunt.  Awkward.  That was very uncomfortable.  That would be wonderful to eat.  Wow.  Mmm, delicious.  It was just so vulgar. 
[01:59:30]  Yes.  I nigh.  I meant it to be.  I nigh.  Doug B. from Salt Lake City.  Rock cocaine.  Ah.  Those are the old days.  A little low.  Yeah.  A little rock.  A little rock.  Go ahead, virus.  You turn.  All right, we got the virus.  Virus, put your headphones on so you know where the queue is.  Give the improv a snack.  It should be easy for you.  But a funny joke.  Here we go.  The virus is in studio.  It's the great American pastime.  Checking out the latest movie at the theater.  And what's a flick without a snack? 
[02:00:00]  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  Whipped after birth.  Oh, it's his turn?  Yeah, it was.  Holy shit.  It was the virus's turn.  Holy mother of God.  Go do medical.  That was the one he wrote for me before.  Please fucking leave and go to wherever the fuck.  Is he in Chicago?  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever heard the virus on our show? 
[02:00:30]  No.  Huh?  Have you heard the virus on our show yet?  I'd like to get my XM kick back on if you could call Don.  Good luck.  Yeah, right.  I mean, Don is a good man and all, but you know.  I'm sorry.  Did I step?  I didn't know.  I thought we were all trying to throw in something.  Yeah, now you gave him time to think.  Doesn't matter.  All right.  Here comes the virus with his answer.  You have it.  It's the great American pastime, checking out the latest movie at the theater and what's  the flick without a snack.  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  I like Quiznos sandwiches because they're mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, toasted. 
[02:01:00]  Get out.  Just get out.  Take Rich with you, please.  Wow.  Go, Rich.  No.  I want my head back.  Wow.  Go.  I want my head.  Fucking, the virus just slammed the door really mad.  Look how mad he is.  He had a good one.  He did.  He thought he had a good one.  Because it's good.  He's so mad. 
[02:01:30]  Like we'd all know the Quiznos commercial.  We don't know it or care about it.  I just start laughing and go, wow, the virus finally came up with a good one.  Beat it, Chubsy.  He hates that bit.  Don't call me Norman.  Oh, Dave in Baton Rouge has the Rich Voss answer.  Yes, Dave.  Yeah, I know exactly what Rich orders.  Joke duds.  Joke duds?  Joke duds.  Joke duds.  That's funny.  That was funny.  That's good.  That's pretty good.  Oh, wait.  This guy's got one for Rich Voss. 
[02:02:00]  Brian in Rhode Island.  Yeah, Rich, when you go to the movies, do you order Louis Baines?  Yeah, an order from Louis Baines.  Oh, wait.  Charlie Philly has one for Rich.  Charlie.  I like to order tortillas.  They love you, Rich.  They love you.  Sometimes I don't eat anything because I had a lean cuisine. 
[02:02:30]  Good and stupid.  Danny, Danny looked down good and stupid.  And Mike and Kikes, wow.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Oh.  I, nigh.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  We got one now.  Mike in Arizona, Mike.  Hey, cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat. 
[02:03:00]  Very good.  You want to hear the real answer?  Yes.  Yes.  It's the great American pastime, checking out the latest movie at the theater, and what's  a flick without a snack?  What's your favorite snack to order when you get into the movies?  Popcorn.  That little two-hour diversion could be costing you far more than the $12 you'll spend on a  popcorn drink combo, though.  At Regal Theaters, the medium combo is a belly-busting 1,600 calories topped by three  days' worth of saturated fat.  This is an air-popped popcorn we're looking at. 
[02:03:30]  This is popcorn that's soaked and fried in oil.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm more upset that a bag of popcorn and a drink costs 12 fucking dollars.  It's ridiculous.  What do you mean it's soaked in oil?  Oh, the little kernels.  Right.  Yes, little kernels.  They never made popcorn at home before they made it easy.  Right.  You got to put the oil in there?  Rich likes spittles. 
[02:04:00]  Spittles.  Wait, Ed on Long Island's got one, too.  Ed.  Hey, Rich gets bomb bombs at the movie.  Bomb bombs.  You made me snort, you fuck.  Good job.  Second half of the story.  So we brought our snack revelation to New Yorkers.  For comparison, we made up an equivalent 1,600-calorie plate of three McDonald's quarter pounders with 12 pats of butter. 
[02:04:30]  That's right.  Popcorn and soda.  Burgers and butter.  We asked, which is healthier?  I would think the burgers.  You got three burgers, bread.  What is that, butter, too?  12 pats of butter.  Wow, that's crazy.  That's the exact same?  The same.  Yeah, I couldn't tell at all.  Regal responded, saying,  moviegoers have a variety of choices at our concession stands,  and we acknowledge that some are healthier than others.  There's nothing healthy.  No.  What are they talking about?  Uh, actually, the virus fucked up the slogan. 
[02:05:00]  It's actually, mm-mm, toasty.  Ah, he didn't even get it right.  No, he didn't even get the slogan right.  Stupid virus.  He's so mad.  I don't know why he ever comes down here.  All right, you want to do a little, uh, actually, E-Rock brought in a nice Cartman song.  He did.  Yeah.  What is this one about?  A bunch of people enjoying, uh, this little ditty from Cartman.  Mm.  What has happened to this place?  I don't recognize it anymore. 
[02:05:30]  It used to be so fun and special.  What is life worth living for?  The dream is dead.  Our land is gone.  There's a hole in my heart, and I can't go on.  There are too many minorities.  Minority.  At my water park.  My water park.  This was our land.  Our dream.  Our dream.  And they've taken it all away. 
[02:06:00]  They just keep coming and coming.  Minority.  I try to go and tell the police.  But even the authorities.  Are minorities.  At my water park.  There's no place for me to sit anymore.  And the lines just keep getting crazier.  There are Mexicans all around me.  The lazy river has never been lazier. 
[02:06:30]  It's a 40-minute way to go down one slide.  And the instructions are in Spanish on the zipline ride.  Carle sus brazos y piernas dentro de paseos.  Just do it in English.  There are too many minorities.  Too many.  At my water park.  Somebody do something.  Where did they all come from?  Why can't they leave this land alone?  And it's such a tragedy.  Feel good like dying. 
[02:07:00]  We're not the other way too long.  We've got to change our priorities.  And get all these minorities  Out of my water park.  Minorities.  Mexicans and Asians.  Black people.  I think I even saw Native American grow.  God, I'm asking, please  Get all of these minorities  Out of my water park. 
[02:07:30]  My water park.  My water park.  That's pretty fucking good, man.  It's so true.  Does anybody go to Great Adventure anymore in Jersey?  If you want to go to a water park  With your own people  You have to go  You have to go pretty deep into Pennsylvania.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That fucking pool there  You remember that story?  Right?  I heard nothing.  Which one?  The private pool in Pennsylvania 
[02:08:00]  They bust in all these Afro-Americans  Afro?  You are so uncomfortable.  And didn't they like  Throw them out or something?  They said there was too many kids in the pool.  Well, because the kids were having kids in the pool.  I think that was Philly.  Yeah.  In Pennsylvania.  Oh, you said Pennsylvania?  I'm sorry.  Day before vacation.  We're barely listening at this.  Like, you guys have probably already done this or saw it.  And it probably means nothing but the most uncomfortable.  Did you see Rob Snyder? 
[02:08:30]  Is that his name, the comic?  Oh, yeah.  We did a whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  What was your take on that?  What was my take?  Yeah.  I thought he was trying to be funny when he walked in.  He made a joke.  And, you know what?  He wouldn't let it go.  Who?  Those other guys wouldn't let it go.  No.  No, no?  See, I didn't see the whole thing.  I only saw parts.  They made him wait in the parking lot because they've got a busy morning show, okay?  Uh-huh.  And they finally brought him in.  He was pissed off that he waited in the parking lot.  He acknowledged he was mad.  They tried to be cool about it, like, sorry, but we're busy today, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:09:00]  But he just kept going back.  Oh, I was...  It really bothered him.  What is this?  What is this?  He wasn't being funny.  There was nothing funny in between, too.  Rob Snyder, I know.  It's everywhere.  Like, if he was making some jokes in between, but he was just not funny and just...  Yeah, I don't even know.  I never did those guys, so I don't even know.  Dude, it's a tough place to be.  I mean, you're doing your show.  You've got some nice chemistry or a nice subject going, and then a guest is here.  It's a weird place because you know you want to get the guest in because you booked them  for a certain time, but then you don't want to lose what's happening in the studio, so 
[02:09:30]  you kind of try to...  It's a balancing act.  Sometimes you make people wait, and it sucks, and it's probably not right, but you're just  trying to put the best radio out there possible.  But, see, when I...  Like, Bobby's watching, I saw part of it.  The only thing that pissed me off was when the host said, comics, you guys kind of  coming in here thinking you're fucking bigger than God, you know, whatever, that all of  them are like, think they're too good for it and stuff.  Like, I don't know if you guys get that feeling from comics that come in and think they're better. 
[02:10:00]  No, not our stable.  Yeah.  Our guys are fucking cool as hell.  Yeah.  Someone like Rob Schneider wouldn't be cool as hell on our show.  And it's Rob Schneider, Rich.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I don't...  You're way funnier than Rob Schneider.  I'm funnier than half the fuck.  For real.  Thank you.  I'm not even fucking, you know...  It's not a compliment.  It's really not.  What sucks is you got friends like Norton and Patrice instead of Adam Sandler.  That's your problem.  Yeah, I know.  My friends...  Because if you were friends with Adam Sandler, you'd be in all the fucking movies.  It's not him.  It's a backhanded insult.  I know.  That was just a...  Yeah, come on.  A little joke. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, my friends can't help me.  How can...  Patrice is going to help me.  No one can help you.  Take me to fucking Rio.  It doesn't matter who he's friends with, Jimmy.  No.  Spielberg couldn't help you.  If he was friends with Spielberg, he wouldn't be in any movie.  He'd be like, I don't know.  I can't get to the audition, Rich.  I'm a Jew, too.  I got a...  Schindler's Lisp.  Samson Studio.  Yeah, we're going to set up something for after the break.  Sam, what's going on behind the scenes today?  No.  Behind the scenes shit. 
[02:11:00]  This is...  Bobo was questioned by myself and Kenny.  Mainly Kenny, because he's the professional.  Interrogated.  Interrogated.  I got some nice audio in front of me.  Is the audio good, Sam?  Yes, it was done with a hidden microphone, so it's a little low.  You don't have to...  You know, I couldn't mic back and forth, because Bobo might catch on that we were doing something  for the radio.  Right.  But, yeah, Bobo admitted some things.  Really?  Some things...  He fucking folded under pressure.  Probably a fold under questioning. 
[02:11:30]  Thumbs up?  Yeah, he admitted some things about the fugitive and some things about his personal life.  And Ken?  And some things about his opinion on the two of you.  Ooh.  Opium Anthony.  Wow.  And Kenny interrogated him pretty good?  Yes, Kenny did get to the bottom of things very well.  Precious is funnier than Rob Schneider.  That's coming in from Brandon in Colorado.  What's the audio?  That's another part Patrice fucking could have had.  It's long, Jimmy.  We did about an hour on it the other day.  It's really long.  If it was a quick clip...  I wouldn't say...  That's another part Patrice could have had. 
[02:12:00]  Sorry.  I wish I heard that originally.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  That's good.  That's very good.  Yes, Bobo sat through 25 minutes of questioning.  And you got the best part.  The best clips.  All right, good.  Right after the break, some audio with Bobo and Club Soda Kenny.  Stay there.  Thanks for calling the Opium Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  This fuck you goes out to my former boss who gave her best friend my fucking job. 
[02:12:30]  Who's laughing now?  I got a better job than you.  And your baby is ugly.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I want to give a big fuck you to Bill Belichick for going on 4-2 on our own 28.  What the fuck are you thinking?  You gave the close to the ball and fucking Peyton Manning won the game.

I hope you all fuck off and die.  Love you.  Next message.  Yeah, this fuck you goes to myself.  My fucking girl meets this guy at work.  Says he's just friends.  They fucking text all the time.  They hang out.  Being the dumbass I am, I believe it.

I hope you rot in hell, you fucking piece of shit cunt.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to tell my ex-girlfriend to fuck off. 
[02:14:00]  She was hot as hell.  Gave me great blowjobs multiple times a day.  Let me videotape it.  For some reason, I dumped her, and now all I do is jerk off to those old videotapes.  Fuck you.  End of new messages.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. Line 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:30]  What fucking sucks in your ass?  No.  What planet do you live on?  Everyone's doing it nowadays.  You just make everyone angry around you.  That's true.  You really do.  How can I make you angry?  I'm trying to bring a little knowledge.  We're talking about shitting.  Sorry to everybody out there expecting highbrow radio today.  Yeah, come on. 
[02:15:00]  And Voss says he uses a cloth after a bad shit to clean up the area.  So we're all just assuming that he's using what most of America is using these days,  which are the baby wipes, but they now call it just wipes.  All the toilet paper companies are putting them out now.  So Ed goes, yeah, you know, you get one of those wipes that used to be baby wipes you clean up.  It's nice back there.  And Rich is like, oh, that's a really good idea.  That's a good idea.  What planet do you live on?  Everyone's using those wipes.  Everyone knows about the wipes at this point. 
[02:15:30]  For Ben's cranky ass.  My bathroom was right next to my bedroom.  So, like, one night I was sitting there.  We were eating ice cream in bed and, you know, chocolate ice cream or whatever.  So I took the spoon.  I didn't want to walk downstairs, so I put it in my bathroom.  So there's a spoon with chocolate on it and stuff.  And then the next day, these people came over for our pilot, all these executives.  And some guy went up to use my bathroom, and there's a spoon with brown.  I'm thinking, does he think I scooped my ass out?  You're going to dig shit out of your ass.  That's pretty good.  But you said you use a cloth. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, like a rag.  A washcloth.  You wipe your ass with, like, a fucking washcloth?  No, I wipe my ass with a toilet paper, like fucking most people.  And then I fucking, like this.  And then I clean it.  With a washcloth.  With a washcloth.  And then, you know.  Yeah, but why use the washcloth?  You've never heard of the wipes?  Yeah.  Yeah, we have wipes all over the house.  So why do you use that?  Baby wipes.  Because wipes have suds in them.  That's the baby ones.  And you leave suds in your ass.  That's the baby ones.  Now, I'm not talking baby ones.  They have special ones that are made. 
[02:16:30]  They're just moistened, you know, moist towelettes.  For your asshole.  The rag, the cloth is grooved so you can feel it pulling out.  All right, then this is what I need to know.  So they're washcloths, right?  Yeah, washcloths.  When you're done, do you just throw it in the fucking washing machine?  No, you clean your ears and the rest of your body.  No, of course you throw it in the washcloth.  Well, I mean, you use it a couple times.  I'm so stupid.  Use it a couple times.  I must comment.  What?  I must comment. 
[02:17:00]  Tostito here has a point.  He says the wipes don't always work.  Voss is right.  Now, I was saying before, if you're shitting to the point where the wipes aren't working,  then it's shower time.  You've got to hit the fucking showers, and then you're using the washcloth soap and fucking,  you know, getting that undercarriage.  But for the most part, the wipes will work.  Like I said, though, past the point of no return, shower.  Would you ever use a washcloth?  That's what I'm getting at.  Not on the bowl.  Only in the shower.  And if you did, wouldn't you just throw that washcloth right away? 
[02:17:30]  No.  No, you'd go in the shower and do it.  And what?  And what?  Clean out the brown and then throw it in the washcloth?  Any time you scrub your ass with the fucking washcloth, you've got to then take the washcloth and  soap it up and then rub it together like Laura Ingalls down at the river doing her laundry.  You've got to like rub it, bang it on a rock.  What's wrong with you?  What's the matter, Jimmy?  What?  Just fucking soap your asshole up.  I put one foot, I face the shower water, I put one foot up on the fucking end of the 
[02:18:00]  tub, lean forward, I spread my asshole, I put soap in it.  And then he enters.  Yeah, no, that's what I'm talking about.  You know, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you've got to scrub a little bit with the washcloth.  The way he was saying, I was gay, I'm all gay.  Have you ever, have you ever, I've never come across a little queer.  Have you ever been like, you're cleaning your ass a little with your finger and then you  like enjoy it?  Yeah, and then you start finging yourself in the shower and you come like a fucking  jackrabbit.  Fucking.  Jimmy, do you use a cloth or anything or are you just using your fingers and soap? 
[02:18:30]  Fingers and soap.  Are you kidding?  No, my asshole's immaculate.  Yeah, I got to clean this ass in show business.  Why wouldn't you use a washcloth?  You don't love your own asshole with your hand and a bunch of soap in it.  That's how I get a shower?  I put a finger on my asshole's soap on it.  You get right in there with your fucking soapy hand.  But you need a rag.  You need a rag because all you're doing, unless your finger's rough like sandpaper,  you're not going to get it all off.  First of all, yes.  If you got a hairy asshole. 
[02:19:00]  Try doing this.  Here, a prime example.  Try doing this.  Wash your car with a washcloth and then wash your car with your bare hand.  Yeah.  And you tell me what looks cleaner when it's done.  That's a fucking good point.  I think you're going to get into some of the nooks and crannies.  Ah, my friend.  That's a good point.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you.  I know you're too comfortable telling the Jew to get into the shower.  You should be able to deal with your own fluids, Ann, and your own asshole.  No, I deal with my own asshole.  You don't want to touch anything on your body.  After you piss, do you take a fucking toilet paper and get to the last drops? 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  All depends.  Sometimes if you...  Are you in a rush?  Where are you going?  Or is it, you know, in the middle of the night piss?  Sometimes if I'm a little leaky...  I have to raise my hand for this one.  I'll make a little toilet paper cast around my penis.  Cast!  And then you just leave it there and then you forget.  Because I feel a little leaky and then I'll...  Never.  The next time I go to the bathroom, I remove the toilet paper cast from my penis.  I would do that with, like, a quick beat-off.  If you've got to jerk off and then go somewhere, you've got to wrap your dick in toilet paper. 
[02:20:00]  And then you go to take a piss later and you're like, oh, fuck, I got...  Usually after I eat a lot of vitamins, so I know the pee is going to be, like, bright orange,  I'm like, I don't want to stain my underwear.  So I'll do a little penis cast.  That's the best.  After you cum, though, that piss after it, that almost, like, burns,  but you know you're getting to cum all out, so you don't have, like...  Dude, it only burns if you're jacking off with the shampoo in the shower.  What are you talking about?  Because there's a...  There's a period of time... 
[02:20:30]  If you have open swords, you fucking...  A couple.  There's a period of time, no matter how much you wring your dick out after jerking off,  where all of a sudden it'll look like a St. Bernard, like, just clear shit.  You know, your dick is panting and drooling.  And that happens, like, a few minutes afterwards, so...  Well, it's horrible because after, you know, you're jerking off because then it looks nice,  but then it gets to the point where now you're just trying to get that little...  What looks nice about jerking off?  No, I'm saying your dick is at full throttle, so it's not fucking horrific. 
[02:21:00]  Do you get turned on by your own hard-on?  I fucking love my cock.  I'm saying, like, I'll look at it thinking, you know, if I was to blow a guy,  it'd have to look exactly like my dick, because then I wouldn't feel as guilty.  Would it be gay if the cock looked exactly like yours?  It would be fucking perfect.  Like, if the cock looked just like mine, the same curvature, all the same bumps...  Oh, jeez, you've got herpes?  No, warts.  I call them ticklers. 
[02:21:30]  No, I'm only kidding.  What did you say?  Bonnie had what on her back?  Because there was a great line from Kevin from Connecticut.  Roids.  Roids on her ass.  Yeah, okay.  Kevin said that's the ass clit.  Oh, jeez.  Right.  But then after you come, then it shrinks down,  and now the little clearness, it's just like,  it's like this little fucking, you know, acorn dropping a little clear,  and you just want to fucking sleep off the guilt after you're jerking off.  Like, sometimes, like, I'll go in the bathroom at a hotel...  You feel guilty when you jerk off? 
[02:22:00]  Huh?  Why?  My kids are in the room.  All right, good job.  I can't compete with that.  And then, like, if fucking you go in the bathroom, you're pissing in,  like, I'll walk back to the fucking, my hotel bed,  and I'll wipe it on the bed a little, you know, get that little, you know...  She's great, yeah.  God, those hotel beds.  No, is there anything worse than the bedspread in a hotel room?  That's the bed I do on stage.  That's horrible.  But for real, that thing is horrific. 
[02:22:30]  For reals, yo.  Well, do you think, because, like, if I'm just staying last night,  I didn't use a big towel, I didn't take a shower,  I checked in late, and I got up early, I used a wash.  Do you think the fucking maids, or whatever they call them,  you know, Mexican, whatever they call them,  know that the one towel, the little hand rag towel on the floor,  is that you fucking dropped a fucking batch in it?  That's the jerk-off towel, yeah.  Party like a wiffle ball, of course they know.  How horrible is it, they got to just pick up jerk-off towels all day?  Oh, God. 
[02:23:00]  Really?  I had a washcloth, it was like that fucking tortilla bowl they served at Taco Bell.  It's like the fucking bowl part.  It's horrid.  All right, Sam's in here.  Sam, what do you got?  What's the update?  Well, we need the Bobo, so let's bring everyone to the table with this Bobo thing.  We found out that the radio world is going crazy with this bit, a fugitive bit.  Oh, God.  We got a fugitive that's stealing money, and then the listener's got to figure out who  the fucking fugitive is, and tap him on the back, and then they win, like, the money  or something.  I don't really get the bit whatsoever. 
[02:23:30]  But all of a sudden, we had our own fugitive calling the show, right?  Yes, our own.  And somehow he's associated with our own Bobo, we learned.  And the fugitive made Bobo come in here with a batch of cum?  Well, I don't think that was the fugitive's suggestion as much as it was Danny and Travis's  suggestion.  Oh, really?  They're involved with this?  Yes.  But they insisted Bobo come in here with a Thanksgiving dinner, by the way, for everybody, 
[02:24:00]  and a thing of his own cum.  And then at that point, the fugitive, who supposedly is not Bobo, would give back the  money that he stole from Mel Carnizan, or whatever he says.  Card stand.  Card stand.  Card stand.  Card stand.  And to be fair, it was D-Boy's idea for Bobo to save his jizz and bring it in.  Sure.  Of course it was.  And D-Boy likes a beverage while he works.  Danny and Travis didn't tell him to bring in a Thanksgiving dinner.  They told Bobo that everybody would be bringing in food, and that Bobo could bring the turkey, 
[02:24:30]  which was a lie.  Nobody was bringing food.  And so Bobo just looked silly, and his mom paid $35 for a turkey that no one's going  to eat.  She doesn't have money to do that.  Like, who's going to eat that?  Nobody.  He's got a bag of jizz and he doesn't actually have it, but...  Where is he?  Well, we're going to talk to him after the entire show.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He's isolated.  That brings us up to today.  And what happened today with the Bobo and the fugitive?  Well, he called up because, you know, the promotion for the other stations, the fugitive always 
[02:25:00]  calls up and leaves clues as to who they are.  And Bobo was being escorted by the fugitive, and now he's here.  He was interrogated.  Yeah, we told him that the NYPD and Kenny want to talk to him.  Is looking for him.  And I guess they recorded that.  Right.  Yeah, I hit a microphone when he got here.  We immediately, as soon as he got here, Kenny said, told Bobo that he had to go into the 
[02:25:30]  interrogation room, which was the office.  And we turned off the show feed and shut the door and left him in there for five minutes  by himself.  Then...  Was he freaking out?  Yeah, he did not seem happy because Kenny actually has a way of intimidating people.  Really?  Yes.  And then Kenny and I went in and spent 25 minutes questioning Bobo.  Yeah, okay.  And we got the best of the questioning right here. 
[02:26:00]  Bobo admits that he was the fugitive?  Believe it or not, this whole time.  What?  I have to comment.  Everybody will not leave this alone.  The way you say fugitive.  Whatever.  They are...  No, it's...  I mean, if it was 1, 2, 10, 20...  It's everybody.  Everybody's saying...  I didn't even notice.  That's how I say it.  I don't know.  Fugitive.  Say it.  I didn't even...  Fugitive.  How do you say it?  Oh, wow.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  It's like saying, I like Marianne and Ginger. 
[02:26:30]  Fugitive.  Back to the Fugure is one of our favorite movies.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  All right.  I can't say the fucking word.  What do you want from me?  Fuck him.  Because it wouldn't stop.  That's all good.  What are you doing, Rich?  I was going to go write it on my list.  You thought it was you.  Look, I'm not...  I completely realized that I would have a list that's pretty impressive over there, too.  I'll be the first to admit that. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Bobo admits that he's the guy.  The guy.  And I will talk to you when we get to the bottom of this.  All right.  All right.  Well...  You trust me, right?  Yeah, I trust you.  You trust Sam, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what I am going to say is that the guy...  Who were you on the phone with?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got to...  I don't know how many people...  I mean, everybody probably knows this, but Kenny was a police officer.  He was a detective.  He was a detective.  He did this for a living for many years. 
[02:27:30]  What I'm hearing here sounds exactly like when I watched First 48.  Yeah, it was great.  And they drag him into the interrogation room.  He is doing...  He's doing exactly what they do.  He's an expert.  Yeah.  For real.  He is an expert.  He sat in front of...  I sat behind Bobo the whole time and told him to just keep looking at Kenny.  Yeah.  And then...  Good cop.  Dumb cop.  Kenny sat...  Good cop.  Bad person.  Kenny sat right in front of Bobo and leaned into him the entire time.  Direct eye contact. 
[02:28:00]  Dude, that's how they do it.  It's hysterical, man.  Let's start over then.  Yeah.  And listen, and Kenny's going, all right, okay?  Like, you trust me, right?  Like, trying to feel him out a little bit.  I've seen this a thousand times on those shows.  And Kenny's a perfect...  I have a feeling he's going to have Bobo admit everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Very quickly.  Bobo doesn't look like a guy that you could interrogate and he could hold back.  No.  It's in the trunk.  I want to talk to my lawyer!  Yeah, yeah.  You think Bobo's doing that?  Lawyer up!  Dummy.  He hasn't mentioned that yet. 
[02:28:30]  What's not?  All right, here we go.  I just told the detectives that I would talk to you and get to the bottom of this.  All right.  All right.  Well, you trust me, right?  Yeah, I trust you.  You trust Sam, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what I am going to say is that the guy...  Who were you on the phone with?  And don't lie or I'll know.  That was the...  Just checking to make sure I dropped...  I brought the...  Daniel, do I look like a jerk-off to you? 
[02:29:00]  No.  Have I always been nice to you?  You've always been nice to me.  Then why do you sit here and lie to my face?  I'm not lying.  The guy...  Daniel, look at me.  I was a detective.  I know that.  All right?  We know there's no fugitive.  We know it's you.  I told the cops.  I vouched for you.  All right, this whole thing was a bit that Danny and Travis...  All right, all right.  And that's exactly what happens on first 48. 
[02:29:30]  He fucking rolled over in under a minute.  On that fuck rolled over in under a minute.  Oh, my God.  He didn't hesitate.  What a snitch.  What a rat.  What a rat.  What a rat.  Oh, is that classic?  Fucking classic.  I don't know.  Is some guy named Hamburger?  Boo-boo.  Boo-boo with Hamburger shot him.  I just saw this shit.  That was for you. 
[02:30:00]  All right, this whole thing was a bit that Danny and Travis thought of.  What's the bit?  Explain it to me.  No, they thought I should do a fugitive forward bit.  All right.  Who's the fugitive?  It was me.  They thought I should do a fugitive forward bit.  They talked me into doing a fugitive forward bit.  And they asked me to do some kind of voice.  I gave them a little sample of that voice. 
[02:30:30]  And that's what happened.  Oh, wow.  What a rat.  He is shitting a brick in that.  That is so good.  Point Blank has the first 48 penis surgeries.  And Hippo Juice film is the first 48 chromosomes.  Also, throughout the interrogation process, if you're listening, the microphone caught the Meet the Mets ringtone consistently ringing while it was being questioned.  That's what that noise is.  Of course. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  It continues with this fine clip from Kenny.  All right.  So you're the one that sold the money?  That's what you're telling me?  Yeah.  Actually, the fugitive didn't really sold the money.  They asked me to come up with a line.  I don't want to hear the fugitive.  The fugitive is you, correct?  Yeah.  Well, they came up with the reason why I called.  Well, the character.  Where is the money?  The fugitive did not take the money.  No, no, no.  I did not take the money.  Well, then how do we explain the missing money?  Well, there was no missing money. 
[02:31:30]  Daniel, there's money missing.  There's no money missing.  Daniel.  Yeah.  Think about it now.  Who told you to come up with this bid?  It was Danny and Travis.  All right.  So now there's money missing.  Yeah.  Danny and Travis told you to come up with the bid.  Put two and two together.  Yeah, that's right.  They set me up.  They're blaming you now for taking the money. 
[02:32:00]  We got to get the money back.  Have you ever been to prison?  No.  Would you like to go to prison?  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, poor guy.  Holy shit.  Kenny's bad, man.  I would not want to be on the receiving end of a questioning from Kenny.  And he's sitting in the office.  After this, he was asking me,  Hey, did Danny and Travis,  did they hear when I called in as a fugitive on the air?  And I said, yeah.  And he went, oh, they set me up. 
[02:32:30]  They set me up.  He's figured it out that once Danny and Travis heard Bobo call in,  they went up to Mel Karmazin's office,  stole $10,000 from him, from Mel Karmazin,  so that everybody would think it was him.  This is like an action movie now.  Yes.  I've been set up, damn it.  I've got to clear my name, Bobo.  The clean Bobo name.  All right, it continues.  The whole thing was me to just help.  They told me to call in at that time at 7 o'clock yesterday. 
[02:33:00]  Doesn't matter.  All right?  You already confessed, didn't you?  Yeah.  Exactly.  So you're responsible for the money.  I don't have the money.  I never even saw the money.  You think the police are going to believe that?  You were convincing enough to fool ONA.  You can't believe how dumb they are, can you?  I can't believe they fell for it.  Why?  I never expected that from two guys that have been in radio 
[02:33:30]  for over a decade.  I didn't realize they would be that dumb enough to fall for that.  So now he thinks you guys are dumb all of a sudden.  This is good.  An episode of Law and Mental Disorder.  Good one.  Wow.  Who do you think is dumber, Opie or Anthony?  I think Opie might be the dumber one. 
[02:34:00]  Jesus.  Come to think of it, I kind of think Anthony might be.  To someone who is about to turn 18.  About two.  What are you talking about?  No, you heard that bit he was talking about.  This is not a bit, Bobo.  This is a real life situation.  Now I asked you a question, I'm waiting for the answer.  I kind of think that Anthony would probably be the dumber one. 
[02:34:30]  But he said I was the dumber one.  No, then he started thinking.  Right.  You know, if I was with a girl of, you know, 17 and then 18, I guess that's what he was  talking about.  Wow.  I guess Anthony is the dumber.  Holy shit.  Oh, God, this is fucking funny.  Is the money in the bag that you brought?  No, no, that's the food that I brought.  What kind of food? 
[02:35:00]  I was stuffed for Thanksgiving.  Because it's close to Thanksgiving.  A couple of stuff Danny and Travis asked me to bring.  Where'd you get it?  At Boston Market.  How'd he get the money to pay for the turkey?  Good question.  My mother paid for it.  Yeah, isn't that funny.  Who did she get the missing money from?  No, that was her money.  He did not get the money from anybody.  He did not get the money from anybody. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Oh, that poor bastard, man.  He wanted me to tell you guys that he will be back.  He'll bounce back from this.  He will?  Yes.  Where's he now?  He's in our holding cell.  Our holding cell.  You've got to pay the money back.  I never stole the money.  You said that you did.  You said that you had it.  That was how I had to say that to... 
[02:36:00]  That was the whole line that was part of the character.  There is no character.  It's you.  Yeah, well, the character that I was doing, it was me.  There's $10,000 missing.  I never...  Look at 10.  I didn't steal any $10,000.  You said you did.  Why would you say it if you didn't? 
[02:36:30]  That's what they asked me to say.  If they asked you to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, are you jumping?  No.  Exactly.  So you know the difference, correct?  Yes.  Then why would you say something you didn't do?  That was the thing to make fun of, that fugitive cold.  Is this fun?  Is this fun?  No.  No.  I almost feel bad for him.  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  We'll be back with Columbobo after these words. 
[02:37:00]  Columbobo.  That's a good one.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  CSI moronic.  Law and order.  Special persons unit.  The avenging llama.  Very nice.  Co-jack-ass.  Shit, man.  And then finally, here's the last clip. 
[02:37:30]  I never stole the money, and I wouldn't lie like that.  I wouldn't steal money like that.  But you do lie.  You lie about not being gay.  Well, I'm not gay.  All right.  You're bisexual.  Would it be more fair to say, more correct to say you're bisexual?  Well, if it did happen, that was only one thing that happened.  All right.  I'm straight.  You want people to believe that.  Yeah.  But you're actually bisexual, say. 
[02:38:00]  I wouldn't believe that, but I guess you could say that I would buy because of what you did.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  See?  Nothing bad happened.  You didn't get struck by lightning for saying that.  Be proud that you're bisexual.  Say it.  I'm proud to be bisexual.  I'm proud to be bisexual.  I'm proud to be bisexual.  Oh, again.  He's the worst. 
[02:38:30]  Man.  Hey, he's fine.  Oh, my God.  People are just saying that at this point he could get him to admit to, you know.  Anything.  The Kennedy assassination.  9-11.  I was handling Oswald.  I mean, do you guys want to talk to him before the police get here?  Should we have him make one phone call live on the show?  Yes.  Yeah, I'll go grab him.  All right.  Great idea, man.  Who would he call with his one phone call?  I don't know.  Kenny. 
[02:39:00]  He can't hear us.  Great job, Kenny.  Wow.  Could you tell him that he gets one phone call before you, you know, take him downtown for  the weekend?  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, he's really, uh, he's not in a good place right now.  He's really nervous?  Yeah.  He actually believes, like, they set him up for stealing the money.  Of course.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he?  You're very convincing.  Here comes Bobo.  Don't smile.  He's got his head down.  He's just kind of walking. 
[02:39:30]  Mets hat.  Opie and Anthony shirt, like he said.  Oh.  Wow.  This certainly didn't turn out well.  Bobo, what the fuck did you get yourself into, Bobo?  Something happened.  Bobo, stand up.  Bobo, what did you get yourself into?  Something happened, huh?  What happened, man?  Well, let's just start.  Hold on.  I don't...  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  We need the mic on.  That mic's not working.  So, uh, what happened?  The fugitive set you up?  No, this whole, this whole thing started with a simple phone... 
[02:40:00]  This whole thing started with a simple phone call.  Uh-huh.  A simple phone call with Danny and Trance.  I was talking about, you know, maybe I should do, maybe I should spoof the fugitive.  Right.  Spoof the fugitive.  What do you mean?  Yeah, that fugitive that was called, that 90, that, that, that hacky bit that 92.3 now  was doing.  Uh-huh.  Right, right.  I know all that.  I thought they were spoofing it, and then I told him.  That's all well and good.  Well, that would have been fine, but now there's, there's, now there's missing money.  Yeah.  And then I told Danny and Travis, I, I just gave him a demonstration of the bit, right? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Like, I was gonna say, like, the whole thing I came up with was about, just sold 10, the  fugitive vice sold $10,000 for Bell while he was asleep.  That was how the whole line was gonna work.  Well, it turns out someone must have actually did that.  Well, do you know who Mel Carmson is?  Oh, damn.  Because he's not, he's not happy right now.  He wants you to go upstairs and talk to him.  Well, I'm sorry.  Before you go downtown.  Well, I'm, I'm very sorry to the guy if someone actually acted upon. 
[02:41:00]  Trust me, we've been in this, in some bad situations with Mel, uh, Cardston, and, uh,  he's not gonna listen to the sorry thing.  Why are the police here?  What's going on?  I know.  They gotta bring him downtown.  Well, something happened.  Now, you're, you're, you seem to think that somebody set you up, and you're taking the  fall for somebody taking $10,000, and it's either Danny and or Travis?  Yeah.  What you don't, Bobo, what you don't know.  That's a strong accusation.  Yeah, and what you don't know is Danny and Travis took a lie detector test. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  Yep.  They did not take the money.  And they, you can look at them all you want.  They passed.  So, it's really pointing to you.  And why are you smiling, by the way?  Yeah, I'd wipe that smirk right off your face.  No, I noticed they were trying to, I noticed they were trying to set me up.  But they didn't set you up because they didn't take the money.  So, who, whoa.  So, who, where do you think that $10,000 is?  I don't know who took it.  You could probably use it, right? 
[02:42:00]  A fugitive, someone who was trying to, to act upon what I said.  Who's the fugitive?  It could be Danny and or Travis.  Well, no, you were.  You posed as this fugitive guy.  Did you not do both voices on the phone?  Well, it was me, and I did the fugitive, and I just said.  And the fugitive is the one that took the money, right?  No, no, no.  I heard, by the way, I heard that call.  Let me just fucking film your last appearance on this show. 
[02:42:30]  That's bullshit.  I heard the fugitive.  It was two different people.  I heard you talking to them.  That's true.  No, it wasn't two different people.  It was me all this time.  Well, it was not.  Because last time we talked to the fugitive, you were off the bus, and he was on the bus.  Right.  So, how is that possible to be in two places at the same time?  Well, I was just going to say that I was on the bus.  That he was on the bus.  I could tell, because I heard the bus driver, I heard the bus, and then when we talked to  you, it sounded like you were just walking down the street.  You don't sound like the fugitive. 
[02:43:00]  Well, I got off the bus, and then I switched, and then I just said.  Could you do the fugitive voice?  Yeah, you know, that's bullshit.  This is a fugitive caller.  That's nothing like the fugitive.  This is a fugitive caller.  Anthony, we got Mel Cardstan on the phone right now.  All right.  Mel Cardstan.  He can't hear you, Mr. Cardstan, but now he's got the headphones on.  This is good. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, what I was saying, Greg, Tony, I want you to press full charges.  This is not a game.  Howard Stern needed some pocket money.  That is his pocket money.  I want this prosecuted to the fullest.  All right.  So, Mel wants to prosecute.  You want to say something to Mel Cardstan?  Mel Cardstan, I knew you were a stern-ass kisser.  I did not do this.  Wow.  I'm sorry?  This is not a joke.  Bobo, this is not a joke.  This is not a joke.  It's time to, you know.  Well, I did not do this. 
[02:44:00]  How much the fugitive is?  Why is that slow?  I was just a lie.  You're clearly lying, sir.  I'm not lying.  I just made up this character.  He doesn't believe you have to talk to him like the fugitive, so he'll at least hear it.  I'll do the voice to prove it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  This is the fugitive core.  I took $10,000 while Mel Cardstan was asleep.  Stop it.  Stop it right now.  You're not him.  You're not him.  Was that a confession?  I can't say it. 
[02:44:30]  That was me doing that voice.  No, you just confessed.  Mel, we're sending him downtown, so we'll see what the NYPD has to do.  The problem is it's Friday, and there's no judge that works over the weekend, so he'll  probably be in central booking until Monday, but because it's a holiday week, it might  be sometime in the middle of next week before he gets out.  You want to make a phone call, Bobo?  Because your family's going to need to know where you are.  You got your phone on you?  Kenny, is he allowed to make one phone call before you guys bring him down to the cops 
[02:45:00]  on the street?  That is his right.  There is no...  We're getting your phone, Bobo.  So, there's no...  And then Kenny's going to bring you downstairs where the cops are waiting to bring you downtown  for further questioning.  Did you Miranda him?  Daniel, tell him the proceeds.  You were going to get an in-o for this.  Tell him that whole part.  Oh, what?  Yeah, that's what I heard would happen.  What?  Doing this bit. 
[02:45:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, but you were saying that the fugitive needed an in-o to...  So, you were trying to steal an in-o to give to the fugitive, then?  You were trying to steal an in-o.  That doesn't bolster your case, Annie, when you're trying to steal something else.  No, no.  I would say the fugitive, but in fact, all this time it was me.  Yeah, so when we said we wanted to give the fugitive an in-o, you said, as the fugitive,  give it to Bobo.  So, you were trying to steal, to mislead us into giving you an in-o that was meant for someone  else.  Right.  To perpetuate the fraud, right, Bobo?  Right, right.  It was just part of the bit. 
[02:46:00]  I figured maybe they would...  I figured you guys would have enjoyed that bit that I would have maybe...  What, you're stealing from Mal and then stealing an in-o?  Enjoying a crime?  No, this was not a...  I never even stole the money.  I heard the fugitive and you both yell at the same time.  Yep.  We heard that.  I never stole...  That never happened.  You said we...  What was the thing?  We love...  We heard both of you do it together.  That was me trying to do the thing about me and him trying to talk at the same time. 
[02:46:30]  Let me see you do it.  That's not true.  Me love...  It took me difficult.  What?  I was trying to imitate two people talking at the same time.  All right, Bobo, it's time for your phone call.  Yeah.  Because you're really going to be gone for the weekend.  One call.  And then, Kenny, bring him downstairs for the detectives.  Who are you going to call?  Because I ain't getting involved with this shit.  I'm going to call a friend of mine.  I would call Ghostbusters.  Who are you calling?  A friend of mine.  I'm going to call a friend of mine.  Who?  Rob.  Does he have bail money? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he does.  Rob.  How appropriate to you.  Tell me how much you think he's going to need.  Rob.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, his name is Robert.  You're going to need $10,000 just for the bail.  Which counts as three lifelines.  How...  Put it on speaker.  Yeah, put it on speaker phone.  He has to be told, though, the guy.  Yeah, you could just talk to him.  Say we're on the radio.  Yeah.  Are you calling him, Bobo?  Jesus Christ.  Someone keeps on the Mets ringtone. 
[02:47:30]  Someone keeps ringing his phone.  Bobo's phone number was also given out on Twitter last week.  All right.  So meet the Mets.  This is his ringtone.  He's got to know he's on the...  Yeah.  You got to tell him he's on the radio.  First thing, tell him he's on the radio.  I'll turn off the mic, so...  Just babble while I talk to him for a second.  I know you're on the radio right now.  There you go.  I'm on the radio.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Okay, good.  I'm doing good.  Did you hear about the whole thing?  What whole thing?  The whole thing. 
[02:48:00]  I'm sure...  You listen to the show, Rob.  You heard about how I did that fugitive caller.  Yes.  That was me all this time.  And I never stole any money.  I think you did steal the money.  I didn't steal it.  Rob, how could you say that to me?  I think you did steal the money.  Kenny?  No, I didn't steal it, Rob.  His own friend just turned it over on him.  Oh, boy.  Ten grand is missing, and little Jimmy Norton's going to have to figure out who's looked pretty  for you.  Oh, dude.  Oh, come on. 
[02:48:30]  That's a bit harsh, Rob.  No one actually stole the money.  Yes, they did.  It's missing.  I just made up this whole thing from a phone conversation with Danny and Travis.  I'm going to need to get bailed out.  Well, how am I going to bail you out if I thought you stole the money?  But I didn't steal the money, Rob.  I didn't steal the money, Rob.  Your own friends don't believe you.  Yeah.  You must be dishonest.  Kenny, how much time does he have left here?  You better plead your case. 
[02:49:00]  That's Opie in the background.  Are you hearing the show live?  Do you have your radio on?  No, right now I'm at work.  I'm at the rest of the room.  I'm at Opie.  I'm at Opie.  She's nice to him.  And then he can introduce you to me.  And this way, I can tell you how to support it.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks so many people introducing me to him.  All right, Bobo.  I need help, though.  Hurry up, Bobo.  You've got to wrap up your phone call.  Plead.  What I can say is I think that, you know, the boys are definitely right that somebody stole the money. 
[02:49:30]  And you're the one that called on being the mystery by yesterday.  Oh, no.  And I think it was you.  No, I was set up.  Kenny, he's got to go.  I was set up.  Kenny, grab him.  I was set up.  All right, they're taking his headphones off.  Oh, no.  Bobo, is there anything you want to say real fast?  They're yanking you out of here.  The detectives are downstairs.  I'll return as soon as I get out of this.  I'll return.  All right, please call us when you can. 
[02:50:00]  Kenny.  All right, I'll return.  You guys will see me when I get out of this.  All right.  I'll rebound from this.  You're going to rebound from this?  You sure?  Yeah, I'm sure.  You're a little upset about jail?  You heard?  A little bit upset, all right?  I just hope maybe Thanksgiving may have been messed up, but hopefully Christmas won't be.  You probably heard some nasty things that happened in jail, right?  Tell him what you want for dinner.  A tossed salad.  Say.  I'll just take a tossed salad.  All right, Kenny, bring him downstairs to the detectives, please. 
[02:50:30]  See you guys.  I'll be back.  Will you be back, Bobo?  Yeah.  You think you'll be back?  The cops are waiting downstairs, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right, look.  I feel so bad.  I can't do this.  I feel so bad.  I want to cry.  This is horrible.  First of all, he was starting to cry and say, for the record, I'm still in.  I just want to say, I can't help myself.  Dude, he was starting to cry and say, I'll return from this.  Jimmy was filming and actually put his iPhone down. 
[02:51:00]  I'll return from this.  I'll rebound.  I'll rebound.  I'll rebound.  He's starting to cry.  I'm in.  I have nothing to do with this.  I'm still in.  I'm still in.  I'm still in.  Bobo.  We said Thanksgiving's ruined, but hopefully Christmas won't be.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I wish we had a uniformed cop up here, though.  Oh, God.  What I wanted was them to say the cops are waiting downstairs and then just tape them as they  bring them down into the lobby where the cops are waiting. 
[02:51:30]  Do we still get that done, Danny?  Really fast?  Poor fuck.  I thought he almost fainted right there.  I know.  I thought he was on the air.  He was really upset.  I had not really upset.  We have to tell him.  We have to tell him on the air.  We have to.  I don't fucking know.  You have to.  I don't fucking know.  Poor guy.  Could you be any more evil?  I don't fucking know.  We have to.  I feel so bad for him.  I want to see the three sixes in your fucking scalp.  Look, I don't got pit stains.  I'm trying to be.  He's so bad. 
[02:52:00]  That poor little dummy.  Holy fuck.  That poor adult really thinks he's going to jail.  Oh, my God.  It's just when he gets quiet, he's like, I'll rebound from this.  And he goes, I'll be back.  He's going to have a triumphant return.  Oh, God.  Rob was good, though.  His friend was good.  Fucking Rob, whoever you are.  Do we know Rob?  I don't know.  Rob fucking played his part.  What kind of a dummy knows nothing about the judicial system? 
[02:52:30]  Damn, we doing it?  Exactly.  You give him his last phone call, or his only phone call in the studio?  He wasn't read his rights.  We're going to take a break.  They're walking him downstairs to meet up with the detective.  And then he has to be.  We should have audio of that, hopefully, and maybe they'll let him off the hook down in the lobby.  I don't know.  I strongly say we don't, but I'm just one vote.  We should let him off the hook up here.  Yeah.  He'll kill himself.  You know what?  I'm going home early if you're doing that.  At the end.  We'll end it that way.  We can't.  We can't. 
[02:53:00]  We'll figure it out next.  Rich, where are you going to be?  November 27th, 28th, next weekend at the Comedy Shop in fucking Pinebrook.  Jimmy grabbed it.  Ripped it up.  Route 16 and 46, the Comedy Shop in Pinebrook.  Wait, hold on.  Pinebrook, New Jersey.  Time's up.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, the day before vacation.  Yeah.  A big tsk, tsk to Vince and Bayonne.  I really thought he knew better.  I think I've finally had enough of Opie. 
[02:53:30]  He's got no conscience at all.  Bobo is a mentally disabled idiot.  Oh, don't bash Bobo like that.  I don't understand the show, Vince.  How long have you been listening?  No, leave him alone.  Uh-uh.  So what happened?  Kenny?  Yeah, that mic's not working today, bro.  That one's busted.  That mic is busted.  So we told Bobo that the detectives were waiting for him downstairs.  Yeah, so Bobo was escorted outside, down the elevator, and in the lobby. 
[02:54:00]  In the lobby.  Hold it right there.  Because I want to hear the audio as you guys were dragging him downstairs.  Okay, well, this is starting from when you left the studio then.  Yeah, it's going to be off a flip, so just bear with us.  We don't have time to put it on something better.  I'm going to sit up.  Who's going to get you up?  I'm going to sit up.  Oh, no.  Bobo, is there anything that you want to say real fast?  They're yanking you out of here.  The detectives are downstairs.  I'll return as soon as I get out of this. 
[02:54:30]  I'll return.  Please call us when you can.  All right, I'll return.  You guys will see me when I get out of this.  All right.  I'll rebound from this.  You're going to rebound from this?  Sure.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  You have a little upset about jail?  A little bit upset, right?  I just hope maybe Thanksgiving may have been messed up, but hopefully Christmas won't be.  You probably heard of the nasty things that happen in jail, right?  Tell them what you want for dinner.  A tossed salad.  Say.  I'll just take a tossed salad. 
[02:55:00]  See you guys.  I'll be back.  Will you be back, Bobo?  Yeah.  This is where you need to speed up.  Oh.  Oh.  We're getting this for evidence, Bobo.  That's why we're recording.  Your old friend, Bobo, doesn't believe you.  He's going to testify against you.  Okay?  I'm a sucker. 
[02:55:30]  I'm a sucker.  He's going into the office to get his stuff.  Yeah.  Definitely explain what's going on on the video.  He's getting his stuff.  He's getting his jacket and stuff on.  He's talking about the turkey that he brought for everyone.  It's going to be real nice, you know.  Kenny's making him bring her with him because he said he's going to be hungry. 
[02:56:00]  This is all for you guys.  Oh.  You guys don't want it?  No.  You're going to be hungry in there.  We'll see you next year, Bobo.  Yeah, he's watching.  This is your first offense.  Yeah.  It's your first offense, right?  Yeah.  Well, I'll be able to prove my innocence.  He's walking to the elevator.  He'll find the person that set him up. 
[02:56:30]  It's like the real fugitive.  He had a whole group following him, taking pictures of him.  You can ride down with him or just let him get picked up.  Okay.  They're waiting for you down there.  I will find this person.  He's getting in the elevator.  I will find this person.  What are you going to do when you find him?  When I find him, I will beat him up. 
[02:57:00]  How badly?  I'll beat him up badly.  I'm talking UFC.  Badly.  I want him to look like the guy who lost a UFC fight.  Aren't you worried that you're not going to be able to fight well in jail?  I weren't.  There's somebody, Coalmaster Poe.  Who's that?  There's an old security guy.  That guy needs some stuff.  All right, Bobo. 
[02:57:30]  This is it.  End of the line.  Get out there for him.  They're waiting outside, Bobo.  The guy right there.  He's going to sit right there.  He's going to sit right there.  That's Kenny pointing him in the direction of...  Just two people in suits.  Yeah, just two random people sitting in the lobby in suits.  He goes, go ahead and turn yourself over to him.  So did Bobo walk up to him and surrender?  Yeah, then we ran in the elevator. 
[02:58:00]  Giggling.  So he just surrendered to two office workers in the lobby.  He walked up to two random people in suits.  And you guys ran for the oven with your children.  Holy shit.  That is funny.  He put his hands out and everything like he was going to get cuffed.  That's how we leave it?  What they must have thought.  And you guys came back up.  He's down there somewhere just trying to figure it out.  Wandering the lobby. 
[02:58:30]  Trying to find somebody to arrest him.  What, two people just standing there talking to each other in their business suits?  Yeah, just standing in the lobby.  They weren't even dark suits.  They were both wearing tan business suits.  Oh, that is fucking funny, man.  There they are.  Go ahead.  Wow.  I'm here to get arrested.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, poor guy.  I feel bad.  I wonder if they took him.  It'd be funny if they ran a sex slavery ring. 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  And they just happened to be there and they took him and you're sold into male prostitution.  Oh, they see a cock and leave him on the side of the road.  Kick him out of the van.  It's functional.  What is that?  I've had 48 surgeries.  Oh, wow.  The end.  That's, uh...  And there he is, like, just wandering around.  Did anyone else hear the gulping when he was trying to...  Oh, yeah.  He was trying to talk.  Did you isolate the gulp?  Yeah, I got it.  You want it?  Yeah, listen to this gulping.  But they didn't say, yeah, because they didn't take the money. 
[02:59:30]  So, where do you think that 10 grand is?  Oh, there's a double in there.  Can I hear that again?  But they didn't say, yeah, because they didn't take the money.  So, where do you think that 10 grand is?  I was gulping.  I think I gulped that, too.  Oh, really?  I've never gulped.  That was a movie gulp.  Like a cartoon gulp.  That was like the word gulp flying out of his mouth.  Wow.  Aw, poor little feller. 
[03:00:00]  Uh-huh.  Well, that's, uh...  I guess that's how the saga of the fugitive ends.  I think so.  Bobo was taken to custody by two nobodies.  By two fucking people that work in one of the offices.  What did one of the, uh...  Guys that worked for Letterman say?  I don't want to say his name.  Oh, he says...  We got a few big fans over there that were right for Letterman.  He had a really great idea.  He goes, uh...  You guys ought to somehow figure a way out of it for him.  So then he thinks he really is the fugitive.  So, like, for the whole time he's worried, like, the holidays. 
[03:00:30]  He thinks he's going to be cool.  He thinks he's going to be cool.  We would have done that if we were coming back Monday.  But 10 days we'll just forget.  And who knows what he'll do in 10 days.  He might relocate.  No, like, Kenny said, what?  About Florida?  Yeah, no.  When I heard that...  Right.  I told him, look.  Become the real fugitive.  You got some place to hide?  He goes, I could go to Florida.  Like Rico Rizzo.  Exactly.  Go piss your pants. 
[03:01:00]  Rico, it's Ratso Rizzo, stupid.  It's Rico...  Really?  Yeah.  It's Rico Rizzo?  Back to you, Rich.  Oh, no.  It's Ratso Rizzo from Midnight Cowboy?  Yeah.  Ratso Rizzo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That must have been what was on his birth certificate when he was born.  Right.  Rico Rizzo?  Ratso must have been written on there.  It couldn't have been a nickname.  It's Ratso Rizzo.  Just because you were in high school when that movie came out.  How can you not?  Call me Rico in my own goddamn house.  See, his name's Rico.  They called him Ratso. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My name's Rico, not Ratso.  You're right.  I know.  You're right.  Now, you've got to tell you.  A little blunder on that one.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's say how to Mongo the trucker.  Are you the fugitive?  You're going to be the next fugitive.  Yeah.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  Fugitive.  The guy.  Mongo.  Yeah, this is like an episode of Magdum T.I.  All right, that was a good one.  Well, a lot of people liked that bit and others didn't.  Some people get a little attached to the little feller.  I kind of enjoyed that whole thing.  I felt a little bad at the end there. 
[03:02:00]  I felt very bad at one point.  Yeah, when he started really breaking up and getting ready to cry.  You got that, Travis?  We heard it on the phone, but I want to hear it in my quality because you can really hear  how upset he was getting.  All right, they're taking his headphones off.  Oh, no.  Bobo.  Is there anything you want to say real fast?  They're yanking you out of here.  The detectives are downstairs.  I'll return as soon as I get out of this.  I'll return.  All right, please call us when you can.  All right, I'll return. 
[03:02:30]  You guys will see me when I get out of this.  All right.  I'll rebound from this.  You'll rebound?  You're going to rebound from this?  You sure?  Yeah, I'm sure.  You a little upset about jail?  You heard?  A little bit upset, all right?  I just hope maybe Thanksgiving may have been messed up, but hopefully Christmas will.  You probably heard he's racking off things that happen in jail, right?  Tell him what you want for dinner.  A tossed salad.  Say.  I'll just take a tossed salad.  All right, Kenny, bring him downstairs to the detectives, please.  I just want to see if Bobo was here carved into a beam at his house. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  That felt horrible when I found out we weren't having that turkey.  You eat it.  What the fuck are you doing, Rich?  I'm going to have a couple of little...  It's like a goddamn restaurant over here for Rich.  Yeah, what are we...  What are we over here?  What are we, uh...  What are we, uh...  The Grand Central Restaurant Station here? 
[03:03:30]  M&M's on oatmeal?  Yeah.  Oh, it's...  Holy shit, what a great idea.  Wow.  I thought you were going to...  I'm not even going to have the shit out of him.  Oh, no.  Thanks.  What a great idea.  Wait a minute.  There we go.  Wait.  Jimmy just took his bag of M&M's and put it on the floor.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Why would you put sweet and low on your oatmeal that you just put M&M's on the top of? 
[03:04:00]  Uh, because this is all I have left in life.  I have nothing else.  Well, why does it go with regular sugar at that point?  Because that's not sweet enough.  You like to...  I hate the sweetness of sweet enough.  And you sprinkle it on and you don't mix it in.  You sprinkle it on top and then take a spoonful with it all sprinkled on top.  And then what?  You sprinkle more on as you...  More on.  More on as you go on.  More on as you go on now?  Yes, I do.  Wow.  That's like...  That's like a trailer park breakfast you got there.  That is some trashy shit. 
[03:04:30]  And I should know because I used to eat the famous margarine and sugar sandwiches.  Yes.  For real.  Oh, those were great, man.  Wow.  You were poor like me, right?  Butter?  Butter?  You were rich.  We had margarine because that was cheaper.  Oh, it was?  On the fucking Pepperidge Farm bread.  I've told this way too many times, but for real.  It was fucking great.  Because that's what we ate.  No cold cuts for the Hughes's.  Yeah, but if we did get cold cuts, we got like spiced ham. 
[03:05:00]  It was like 30 cents for like a...  Oh, that's the olive shit in the middle of it?  I loved olive loaf.  Oh, is that what it's called?  The olive loaf?  Fuck.  Olive loaf was awful.  Fucking loaf eating a loaf.  Rerendous.  Why would they ruin a nice piece of lunch meat with the olive shit?  Olive loaf.  Olive loaf, right.  Look.  Olive.  Spiced ham.  And now you're drinking a fucking Coke on top of it?  God bless you.  Is there a cum on my chin?  Not for five more minutes.  Here comes the old man. 
[03:05:30]  Should we end with beating him up?  Oh, Christ.  If he glares in here, we should just do it today.  Make sure the audio's off.  Are we going to do it today, Jimmy?  Are we doing this today with this guy?  Before vacation.  We always ruin our vacation.  Well, look at the fucking guy coming down the floor just glaring at us every fucking day.  But we always ruin our vacations wondering if we're in trouble or not.  So we should not today?  Yeah, fuck him.  Keep that as a cliffhanger?  Yeah.  Watch the glare.  He does right about...  Right about now.  Right about there.  There it is.  There it is.  The glare.  We'll take care of that situation after the holiday.  Who is he?  Is he a bigwig? 
[03:06:00]  It's an old talk show host that used to be happening, used to be edgy.  Do you know what would be fun?  There was a time in his career that Howard actually admitted that he was an influence,  that guy that walks by and glares at us.  Uh-huh.  And we had a little issue.  You know what would be fun?  What?  Get a tarp, cover up the couch, right?  Uh-huh.  When he walks by and does that glare, I will fucking take an egg and whip it right at the window.  He'll fucking...  He'll recoil.  He might...  He might...  He'll run to...  He'll run to human resources. 
[03:06:30]  For what?  I threw an egg at the window.  He starts in studio.  I was playing a game.  I was trying to hit Sam.  I'll say, Sam can sit in the corner.  I kind of like the idea.  I'm going to be like, oh, we're playing an egg toss game.  I kind of like it.  I like it.  Call me in when you do that groundbreaking game.  This thing has to come to a head.  It's an egg breaking game.  Well, explain, Rich.  We had a little problem with him because I guess this is his old studio.  He made some comments.  So we made our comments, which are always much more impressive than the original comments.  It's almost like...  And it's like this.  It's because we are... 
[03:07:00]  Ah, Jimmy just smashed a highlighter pen right in the middle of your oatmeal.  Stupid Voss's dumb oatmeal.  And it's open, Rich.  You're actually...  The ink is leaking into it and you're still eating it.  I'm eating around it and I'll just pretend it's the orange fucking M&M.  Oh.  What happened?  You tasted it?  No.  What are you doing?  I put too much in my mouth.  Oh.  So it's never a problem for you.  Yeah, exactly.  It's weird doing that without a hand on your heartbeat.  You're throwing your drug daze. 
[03:07:30]  That's it now.  But anyway, listen.  So we had our comments about what he did.  And then the guy ran into human resources and felt like he was threatened in the work environment.  Yeah.  But now he walks by every day and glares at us.  That's what bothered me.  It's almost like, you know, it's like, look, we've had shots taken at us.  It happens.  And this is a weird one because they were fired the minute we got here.  I know you guys knew who he was.  I really did not know this person.  I'm not that familiar with radio history and stuff.  I don't know this person.  I don't know what he does. 
[03:08:00]  But, I mean, some pretty nasty shit was said about this show.  We're walking into this environment for the first time.  It was pretty much our first day or two.  So we fire back and fire back hard.  And it's where we've always hit back.  It's amazing to me when a show hits you and then you hit them back and they get sad.  It happened with that guy in Cleveland where they start to get weird.  It's happened many different times.  It's like I've never in my life talked shit about somebody and then recoiled when they fired back at me.  I don't comprehend that. 
[03:08:30]  What are they doing?  And go to human resources.  I mean, and the way you fire back, I mean, when you do the eggs, that's going to close it out.  I'm telling you.  When you throw the eggs at the window, the guy's going to fucking...  I just want to see him recoil and not look at...  Give us that fucking look every day.  That'll teach him.  That a boy, Ant.  Rich, do your plug.  I got a flight to catch. 
[03:09:00]  We're done.  I'm done.  Comedy shop.  Friday and Saturday.  Whatever the fuck.  What days is it?  Next weekend.  Next Friday, Saturday.  Next Friday.  27, 28.  The comedy shop.  Can some of these fucking O&A people come out to my goddamn shows?  Why are they coming out?  Some do.  You asked for it.  Some do.  No, because they're good audience members.  No.  They do no comedy.  And have a good Thanksgiving, especially if you come to the Stress Factory the night  before Thanksgiving.  I might come and hang out.  To the late show.  There's early shows sold out. 
[03:09:30]  What week act do you have on before you that you know you can follow?  You will show up.  Chica P. Mass is Friday the 27th at the Hukilao Chinese Restaurant.  Saturday the 28th, Boston, the Wilbur Theater.  And I'm doing Caroline's again, December 3 through 6, right here in New York on Broadway.  Finally returning to Caroline's after well over a year.  When you said Chica P. Mass, I thought it was some kind of religious thing you were doing.  What do you mean?  I got it.  Can you awkwardly leave?  I thought it went very well.  I like it. 
[03:10:00]  You had a really good show.  You didn't really, the last 10 times, you didn't really break that golf club.  You were just lying about that.  Really?  It doesn't matter.  How much do I owe you?  Huh?  How much do I owe you?  I don't know.  It was the wrong thing to do.  I'm sorry.  Oh, cool.  Why is Chris Christie being interviewed on The Mortal America?  Oh, wait.  That's Cher's daughter.  Oh, I thought that was already lying.  Chastity Bono's now wearing business suits.  She looks like Chris Penn.  Holy.  After.  Why do you have to dress in...  Now I'm going to be your daddy.  You stop pointing that clitoris at my daddy. 
[03:10:30]  I wish that was Jay Moore.  She, he looks really uncomfortable in a tie.  Really uncomfortable.  She doesn't really look like a dude that much.  I mean, she looks...  She looks more like a dude than a...  Than a girl, than a lesbian.  She looks just like a hardcore lesbian.  And her woman is staying with her.  She's going full dude's dyke.  So that's confusing.  She's with her lesbian friend?  Yeah.  She had, like, a lover.  A lover that was kind of in shape.  Oh, I feel like a magic marker sickness.  This was fun today. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  Guys, thank you for having me.  Yes.  And I don't mind that I had to wait in the parking lot.  It didn't bother me.  You came right in.  You saw that.  I know I did.  I know I did.  Rich, you're a very funny guy.  You did great today.  Thank you.  And people should see you next weekend, next Friday and Saturday at the Comedy Shop in Pinebrook, New Jersey.  All right?  Yes.  Thank you.  We're going to have a lovely holiday, you guys.  Right.  Let's go.  Yeah, we're going off the grid for about 10 days.  So you guys enjoy yourselves.  Make sure you see Jimmy at the Stress Factory the day before Thanksgiving. 
[03:11:30]  And we'll reconvene a week from Monday.  All right?  Have a good one.  Happy holidays. </pre>
