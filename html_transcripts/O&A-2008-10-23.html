<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious rant from Opie about their studio's abysmal technical condition.  He complained incessantly about a malfunctioning microphone, describing the sound as being like "speaking through a tin can," accompanied by a persistent buzz and hum.  This led to escalating frustration directed at unnamed management figures, the GM and PD, contrasted with fond recollections of a former employee, Tom Chiasano. The hosts humorously compared the studio's state to a post-apocalyptic wasteland, referencing *I Am Legend*, and highlighted the archaic wooden construction of the equipment, including the control board and mic stands.  The missing "dump" function for censoring added to their anxiety about potential FCC violations.  Several listener calls followed, with one, David from Michigan, receiving a particularly hostile response.  Other callers offered technical advice and shared their sympathy.  A humorous interlude involved a caller demonstrating a misunderstanding of how telephones function.  The arrival of guests Otto and George indicated some technical improvement, but the overall tone remained one of dark humor and anger towards their employer, culminating in discussions of violently taking over a nearby studio to improve their work environment.  Throughout this segment, they promoted Jim Norton’s new book and mentioned Kevin Smith as an upcoming guest.

The show then transitioned to announcements about their upcoming Halloween party and a discussion of gifts Opie received, including a copy of *Grey's Sports Almanac*, sparking conversation about *Back to the Future* and Opie's burgeoning collection of related memorabilia.  The hosts then discussed a racist baseball card of Pumpsy Green, the first African-American player for the Boston Red Sox. This transitioned into "Jocktober," a segment mocking Scott and Todd.  Anthony discussed his divorce, angrily lashing out at his ex-wife's lawyer, Dominic, who had appeared on Howard Stern's show. A caller offered details about Dominic’s appearance.  The conversation then shifted to Anthony's upcoming marriage, followed by a detailed and humorous discussion about their colleague E-Roc's extensive cruise history, including his Diamond Club membership and unusual late-night snacks (BLTs and chocolate milk while watching *Snow Dogs*).  They examined a picture of E-Roc on their website, and engaged in a playful argument about penguin geography. E-Roc then called in to confirm his cruising habits and Diamond Club status, and the conversation continued about the amenities and cost of cruise ship luxury suites.

Kevin Smith joined the show, and the ensuing discussion centered on his new movie, "Zach and Miri Make a Porno," and the challenges he faced with the MPAA, detailing his successful appeal against an NC-17 rating.  The conversation drifted to Halloween anecdotes, disappointing Halloween candy, Smith's encounters with celebrities (including Tracy Lords and Jason Mewes, whose penis size became a recurring joke), and a lengthy discussion about *Back to the Future*, including a debate on the attempted rape scene.  Smith also discussed scheduling conflicts between appearances on Conan O'Brien's and Jimmy Kimmel's shows, and stated his disapproval of Barack Obama's political stances, particularly regarding taxation and the Second Amendment, explaining why he did not vote for him. The conversation concluded with further discussion about his movie and body image.

A further segment with Kevin Smith focused on government spending, the legalization of prostitution and drugs, and the relative dangers of driving under the influence of weed versus alcohol. Smith described receiving a massive 103-inch television, drastically changing his lifestyle, and his increased weed consumption, resulting in significant weight gain.  He also discussed his views on gun control and his personal gun collection, including specific firearms and his opinions on assault weapons bans.  The conversation included anecdotes about Seth Rogen, the effects of being stoned on sex, and Smith's observations on the differences between straight and gay men, based on a conversation with an unnamed individual.  Smith shared clips from his podcast, "Smodcast," including one about his daughter's association with goths and satanists.  The segment concluded with further discussion of his movie, future appearances on the show, and brief mentions of the stock market and John McCain's campaign.

The final segment heavily featured a John McCain campaign gaffe where he mistakenly agreed with a statement labeling Western Pennsylvania as racist, before attempting a clumsy correction. The hosts repeatedly played and mocked the audio.  The discussion shifted to Chris Rock’s latest stand-up special, Bruce Willis’s perceived penis size, and further promotion of Kevin Smith's *Zach and Miri Make a Porno*.  The segment included tangents about a defunct game show segment and a search for a sexually suggestive "line of the day" joke involving Winnie the Pooh.  The overall tone remained irreverent, vulgar, and comedic.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  How are you today?  Oh, hola.  There we go.  Great.  Good to see they fixed the...  I'm not even going to...  Forget it.  Hi, how are you this morning?  I'm just going to say...  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  I don't even care.  Oh, my God.  I don't care.  My mic sounds like I'm talking through a tin can.  Yeah, but Anthony...  No, this isn't a best-of show, by the way.  I know.  It's a brand-new mic problem.  But when you say, I don't care, it means you care.  It means I drastically care and want to kill somebody.  What?  Do they not hear me every day?  Fix my microphone! 
[00:01:00]  Christ!  Fix it!  Fix my mic!  Tomorrow!  Fixed!  Fix it!  Jesus, mother of Christ!  I'm beside myself.  Is it not...  Do you not hear me?  That's good. 
[00:01:30]  We're flying under the radar.  They're not hearing the show.  Listen to that sound.  Listen to it.  Listen to it.  It sounds like when they were listening to the rebel forces battle the Death Star back in the base.  This is horrible.  Hey, this place.  Nothing works here.  But here's some in yours.  For some in yours. 
[00:02:00]  Well, uh...  Oh.  God.  Damn it.  I think they just hide in corporate.  They know the whole business is collapsing and they're just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, God.  Look.  Oh, God.  Hey, Sumner Redstone.  My mic doesn't work.  I'm going right to the top.  He's got his own problems.  Southern guy.  My mic doesn't work.  Southern guy?  Who's he?  I don't know.  The guy thinks everything should be local. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  The guy had big plans for us.  We haven't talked to him in a year and a half.  Good job.  Good job.  GM, PD.  My mic is...  Oh, what?  What GM?  Exactly.  What PD?  Holy God.  Oh, God.  I can't take it.  I miss Tom Chiasano.  This should be something that the second I comment on the fact that my mic sounds like shh, shh,  you know, that the next day I should come in and be like, oh, that sounds better. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Fix-It Guy.  You don't worry.  But it's this buzzing.  Listen to this, Mike.  It over-modulates.  When I talk, it shouldn't do that.  Listen to it.  You like that?  Wake up.  Wake up at 6 o'clock.  Meep.  Meep.  Meep.  Meep.  Meep.  I'm an alarm clock.  I'm an alarm clock buzzer. 
[00:03:30]  That's my voice today.  Yeah.  If I turn you down too low, then you're tinny.  I don't know where to...  I don't either.  I don't know how to talk...  My voice has been shot because I have to yell half the time into the mic.  And then, all right, a little processing going on there.  Is that what a...  I just took, like, all the high end out of it or something.  Oh, high ten.  And it's hard for me to tell because now my ears are tainted.  Tim, are you the GM?  I don't know.  Who's the GM here?  I have no idea.  Oh, I can't wait.  Once Obama's elected, this will all be better. 
[00:04:00]  You know what?  That seems to be what everybody says.  Is our other studio working?  Why don't we just go over there today?  Oh, God.  Can we just go over there today?  And I think it's time to start courting new suitors.  Please.  You and I have to start courting new suitors, if you know what I mean.  We've got to start dressing nicer.  We have to kind of, like, put on some colognes.  Yeah.  Maybe some short, like, skirts.  And we've got to...  Start networking ourselves.  Yeah.  We have to go to the...  Get out there. 
[00:04:30]  We have to get out there and try to find new suitors.  Because for some reason, they don't give a crap around here anymore.  Is there anyone that cares at all?  Is there anyone that gives a crap at all about these stations?  Is CBS just selling off all the stations and going into, like, the candy business or something?  And they just don't care?  And letting everything just break down?  It's like I Am Legend.  Yeah.  Like, everyone died and no one knows what's going on. 
[00:05:00]  We joked about it.  I'm sick of this.  He had better equipment to work with than I Am Legend.  Yeah, he did.  We joked about this, but I really believe that they're just going to let this stuff rot  to the point where it's just going to be on the air and it's going to go dead for good  and that's it.  Well, you just can't...  And then they'll have a garage sale and some old-time radio collector will buy all this stuff  and make believe he's a big radio star in his garage or something.  See, Ant sounds like...  One guy says, Ant, you sound great.  Shut up.  And the very next one is, sounds like a kazoo. 
[00:05:30]  And that's exactly what I sound like.  Is it better now?  It's...  I guess it is.  It's hard to tell.  Huh?  No, the buzzing's...  No, the buzzing we've just gotten used to.  No, the buzzing we decided...  We could live with it.  I yelled and screamed about that months ago.  I said there's a buzzing that is, like, giving me headaches.  Just ever...  Don't say a word for a second.  Listen to this.  See, that's not supposed to be there.  It's not supposed to be there.  What is that?  It's not supposed to be there.  Are there tubes in there?  I don't know.  Are there tubes that have to warm up? 
[00:06:00]  I'm just going to pour coffee on the board and see what happens.  It'll fix it.  It probably would.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Tom Chiasano wouldn't allow this to happen.  No, no.  No, they got rid of him, though.  He'd be yelling...  Well, thank God they got rid of him.  You know, he was the dead weight around here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God you got rid of the guy that's been a soldier for decades for your company.  Thank God.  Because, obviously, things got better after he got rid of that dead weight.  They just canned anyone making, like, any money that had been here forever and ever and ever. 
[00:06:30]  Not only was Tom a soldier, he came in, he took pride in what he did.  We absolutely didn't agree with everything he said.  Of course not.  But I like the passion the guy had.  I like the fact that he came in here in suits and ties every morning at 5 in the morning.  That's crazy.  We barely shower.  We overlooked his homosexuality.  Right.  None of it bothered us anymore.  Of course.  Didn't bug me at all.  I'll take the gay thing as long as we can have him back. 
[00:07:00]  Just bring Tom back.  Stump brain, what are you doing?  Are you just in over your head with these corporate dopes?  I'm not the GM, but I did discuss this with the GM, and a week ago today I got a phone call from Mr. Okulski.  Is that his name, Tim?  Okulski.  Okulski.  Very tall man who's in charge of all things engineering.  Oh, okay.  And he said this was a number one priority, and they were on it.  Wow.  I'd hate to be the number two priority.  I hate to tell you, but in the year 2008, they don't use wood to build tech stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Why do we have wood in front of us?  There's wooden things all over the studio.  Just imagine, you know, everyone loves their cell phones, the Blackberries and the iPhones.  Just imagine your phone was made out of wood.  That's pretty much what we're dealing with around here.  Could you imagine that?  You get a new cell phone, and it's wood.  They gave up on wood when the 90s hit.  Well, Ant sounds a little better, except for that hum.  Yeah, the hum.  At least I could talk without buzzing. 
[00:08:00]  Okay, this will do.  Is that hum Ant's mic?  For now.  Turn Ant's mic on for one second.  No, it's not.  No.  I took Ant's hum out, I think.  No.  What's that hum that's there?  I think that might be...  Oh, boy.  Do you guys hear that?  No.  Yeah, there's...  I hear that hum.  It's fantastic, isn't it?  You do know we're broadcasting to the world right now.  Let me see.  Nope.  Nope.  Still there.  The hum is cool.  Thank God that they left mine.  It wasn't mine, because I know that the decision would have been,  let's just leave Jimmy's off, and then what happens to Jimmy?  He's left out in the cold, isn't he, everyone? 
[00:08:30]  We would have just said, beat it, stupid.  I don't want to be.  I like being here.  Leave.  Take your book and beat us.  I don't want to take my book, Amazon number 18.  Jesus, what a Google bomb is great.  I hate your guts, Jim Norton.  Holy mackerel.  It would be fine, though, because you could just leave and still get paid,  because corporate apparently wouldn't even notice.  Why don't we just leave?  Dude, they have no idea.  And just silence.  It'll be hours of silence instead of a show, and I'm sure we'll get a,  yeah, great show, great show.  We've got to make some kind of stand. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, let's make a stand.  We would if we thought it would make a difference, but, you know.  Is there like an upstairs?  We used to talk about the guys upstairs.  Yeah.  They're still up there somewhere?  Are there guys upstairs?  You know, that was always something I made.  What are they doing?  Management.  Well, they're down the street now.  They went from upstairs for a second.  They're down the street.  Down the street.  They're consolidating into one building, aren't they?  They're going downtown.  Every station is going to be in one building. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, well, how it's going, I'm sure they're going to end up in a shantytown.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Low rent.  Yeah, low rent.  This is the way you make things work, by the way.  Yeah.  Instead of investing in a company and really like, you know, doing your best,  and instead of making cutbacks, you figure out a way to increase revenue  through programming.  There's just plenty of things to do, but instead, just cut everything down  and let it rot.  I want corporate to not fix anything, and I want to just, 
[00:10:00]  I never imagined it would be like this.  Let's see how bad it could get.  I figured, you know, we would have some great ending to our careers,  but instead, I just want to fade away.  I want the show where the sound quality just gets worse and worse,  and we're still doing great bits, but it's through like,  you don't even hear it anymore.  And then, eventually, it's just silence, and that's it for us.  It's like a signal dying on a sinking ship.  Exactly.  A submarine or something.  Which is a great analogy. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, does corporate suck?  I just don't understand.  I've seen a massive drop-off since the NEW days.  And the corporate mentality.  Wow.  This stuff would have been fixed pronto.  That's right.  Pete Johnson would have fixed it.  Yeah.  Wow.  The wood thing is so goddamn funny.  It's preposterous that there is wood.  Look at this.  That the board is made of wood.  Right.  And the number one market in the world.  And the mic stands are made of wood. 
[00:11:00]  And a computer.  What is that?  A computer.  Yeah.  One of the biggest bits of technology that took off at the last half of the,  I mean, the last part of the last century.  Sure.  And the beginning of this century is sitting on a wooden stand.  Yeah.  It's all about wood around here.  They love their wood.  Well, it makes it easier to burn this place down.  So thanks for that.  Because one day we will.  Well, take the new iPhone.  Do you want the white or the oak?  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Oak.  I'll take the oak iPhone, please.  It says a lot when your technology is built with wood.  That's all I'm saying today.  Bring it back to the Apple store because your wood had a knot in it and the knot fell out.  All right.  Quit your crying.  No one wants to hear it.  Yeah.  Who said that?  All right, David.  David in Michigan.  You don't want to hear it?  Then turn your frigging radio off.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go into your crappy job and complain. 
[00:12:00]  Go ahead to management.  Hey, David.  Hey.  David.  You ass.  Go to your job and complain to the manager.  The friolator doesn't work.  How would you feel if the friolator didn't work?  You frigging low class piece of crap.  Shut up.  Shut up.  There you go.  You shut him up.  Hit an abutment.  Yeah.  I hear you driving, you douche.  I hope your tires don't work and you skid into a pole.  Oh, stop crying that your brakes don't work.  Stop crying that your brakes don't work. 
[00:12:30]  Hit a family.  Burst into flames and have all of you die.  Oh, David.  Stop with the fake laugh.  You know that was a good line.  Oh, shut up, David.  That was a good line.  Go screw yourself.  That's right.  And your mother.  That whore.  Your whore mother.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place. 
[00:13:00]  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Hey, let's say hi to Ellen.  She wants to talk to you, Anthony.  Ellen, how are you?  I'm fine.  Oh, this is just a fabulous morning.  Hi, Ellen.  Hello.  How are you this morning?  Ellen.  Ellen.  Don't listen to the radio.  Listen to your phone. 
[00:13:30]  Ellen.  Ellen?  Ellen's been tipping a few this morning, apparently.  Is she gone?  And she has no idea how a phone works.  She wants to try to calm you down.  She's talking to the radio.  All right.  Well, let's say hi to John in Brooklyn.  Hi, John.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, John?  Brooklyn.  Congratulations on the book, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, Anthony.  You sound like one of those conversations that Mission Control used to have with the Mercury 
[00:14:00]  Mission astronauts back in the 60s.  Yes.  It's the same technology.  I have an engineering suggestion for you.  Yeah.  At the end of the show, you should make a permanent adjustment to that microphone, perhaps with  a large hammer.  And they'll take care of it then.  You know what the problem is?  It's like smashing your monitor when your computer doesn't work.  The microphone isn't the problem. 
[00:14:30]  It's what it goes into.  I'm rational enough to realize that at this moment.  Barely, but I am.  What do you think that noise is, though?  It's not coming from...  That humming?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that until...  You know what that noise is?  It's electrical stuff.  You know what that noise is?  Tesla's doing experiments down the hall.  That noise is cancer.  Enjoy it in 10 years.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, who knows how much radiation is pouring out of this crap.  No kidding.  Old stuff like this? 
[00:15:00]  I don't want cancer.  Well...  Who does?  I don't enjoy cancer.  It's too early.  How do you have fun with cancer?  No, you can't.  Put a hat on the tumor and yell at it.  You can't have fun with cancer.  And you know what you have to do is yell at the truckers, because when you're mad, you  take it out on the truckers.  Because the truckers yell at me.  I'm only defending myself.  I love the truckers.  I love the textiles they transport and the goods and services they bring to our area.  Believe me, I know.  So everything is trucked. 
[00:15:30]  So there'd be nothing in the stores if it wasn't for the truck drivers.  I would actually be able to drive down a side street if it wasn't for the truck drivers.  I wouldn't have to wait 15 minutes while some idiot tries to back into a loading dock  on a narrow street if it wasn't for the truckers.  Of course.  I know what this is all about.  Yes.  Secretly, you're a huge Rays fan.  And you're a little upset that they lost one of the World Series.  Well, you know, I've got to be honest with you.  I was rooting for the Rays all night. 
[00:16:00]  And I am a little bummed that the Phillies took game one of the World Series.  3-2.  My friend.  Was that the score?  I have no idea, because I could give a crap.  I don't know.  I don't care about the World Series.  Dude, I didn't even know it started last night.  I was pissed, because at 11.30, I wanted to watch Seinfeld for the 80 billionth time  I would see the same episode, and the World Series was on, and I was mad.  I had to change the channel.  I watched Taxi Driver.  God, does that seem great with Scorsese in the backseat?  Oh, God.  See that?  That's my wife. 
[00:16:30]  That's not her.  That's not my apartment.  You know who lives there?  Oh, wow.  Oh, does he get into it?  Oh, yeah, he does.  You know who lives there?  Oh, f***.  That's right.  A f***.  You know who lives there?  Of course, you wouldn't know who lives there.  Why would you know who lives there?  Scorsese.  He was really good in that.  Just an angry, ready-to-kill-his-wife.  Just an amazing movie.  Did he kill her?  Did he imply he's going to kill her?  He implies he's going to take a 44, and what a 44 can do to a face is really mess it up. 
[00:17:00]  He goes, but do you ever see what it can do to a girl's f***?  Yeah.  He's not happy.  Oh, he was not happy.  He could have been a good actor, that guy.  Yeah, yeah, he did a good job.  He could have been a good actor.  He is a completely different entity with age.  You know some people that can turn into completely different people?  Yeah.  Like the Scorsese now, you wouldn't even know that was him looking at him in that movie.  He's very young, got a beard and mustache and everything, and just does not even look like him. 
[00:17:30]  Like if you aged that guy in Taxi Driver, it wouldn't look like Scorsese does.  But yeah, just a great movie.  All right.  I guess...  And my TV worked.  There was no buzz.  It was fantastic.  Electronics at work.  Woo!  I get that after 11 o'clock.  No, it's weird, too.  We're lucky enough.  When our technology doesn't work, we call a guy.  He comes by, and the little tweak, and you're back to normal in seconds.  Why does this take a month?  And you know what?  You've got to throw a little money at him.  A little bit.  I understand that.  A little bit.  But apparently, they don't understand that here. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, no.  They'd rather just have it break down.  They'd rather just...  And when the machine breaks down, we break down.  Well, this is the other side that we bitched about, I don't know what, four or five months  ago.  We're like, call me crazy, but if you start firing everybody, a few months are going to  go by, and you're going to notice that maybe you shouldn't have fired all these people.  No PD, no GM, no offense, Tim.  No engineer.  What?  Uh, it's everything I've said. 
[00:18:30]  What happens when you take away all the maintenance guys in Sim Amusement Park, a Sim roller coaster,  take away the maintenance guys, and see what happens.  It's that simple.  People fly off the ends of the roller coasters and die in a big explosion.  What did they expect to happen?  Yeah.  We got wood for technology in front of us.  This should have been a brand new board 10 years ago.  That's good.  Can someone whittle a new board for us, please?  Can someone scrimshaw us a mic? 
[00:19:00]  Growing it.  Yeah.  Our new board is still being grown.  Yeah.  They haven't cut it down yet with a chainsaw.  Well, I'll whittle you a new board there, Opie.  There you go.  Look, there's the Apple computer.  We'll put that up on onaradio.com.  There it is.  If Apple used the same logic as CBS or whatever the hell the corporation name is these days,  Viacom, that's what their latest computer would look like.  See, but they moved on from that. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Well, we're still in the wood phase of technology.  God.  I would.  Get me to practice.  No, my thing takes me to practice.  See, someone else is very mad at home, too.  Your equipment, your electronic equipment should not be made out of the same stuff you throw  in your fireplace for warmth.  Right.  It just, no.  Metal, plastic, space-age polymers, Opie.  That's what I'm looking for.  Stunt brain. 
[00:20:00]  And tell me when this board was the hot new thing.  What year?  Oh, boy.  I really need to know.  I would guess 80.  I mean, you got-  Early 80s.  You got Howard-  And it was made to be retro.  You got Howard Stern's name on the board still, so-  Yeah, 83, 84.  He hasn't done a show here in about three years, so-  What's scratched in there?  Howard Hart Allison?  That's how old this thing is.  Come on.  Jokeland.com.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  9-2-2 wine is scratched into the-  Wow, old school.  Nice.  Well, there is a look, Jackie, and a look, Fred Button still on the board.  Well, we mentioned all this about a week ago when we did this exact same break.  Stupid us.  We thought it'd be fixed by now.  Stupid, stupid us.  That buzz and humming is just fantastic.  I love it.  I hear that buzz in my sleep now.  Thanks.  I didn't even notice that until-  I know you guys have mentioned it, but-  Dude, it's really loud. 
[00:21:00]  It's getting worse.  I'm telling you, slowly but surely, this is just going to cease to work, and we're just  going to be sitting here going, oh, I guess today's the day we just walk into this.  I hear lawyers chew through the wires.  That couldn't be the problem.  Yeah.  If there's a lawyer getting into your house, you have to put tinfoil in the hole.  Oh, boy.  Oh, thank you, Axel Rosenberg from MySpace.  He writes, the problem with the modulation has been found. 
[00:21:30]  It's termites.  What?  We have another technical problem.  The dump is officially dead.  It's not working down the hall.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It just ran out.  There's nothing.  All right.  What do you mean it ran out?  We haven't been cursing?  They're freaking out down there.  I was just told to tell you, there's no dump.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So right now.  Is this a technical problem, or is it going to build back up?  I'm thinking it's a technical problem, the way everyone's screaming back up.  All right, hold on to this.  I'm not going to curse.  Believe me.  I'm going to say the word rocket, and I'm going to try to dump out of it and see if my dump. 
[00:22:00]  Nice, hard.  There.  I just said that.  Don't be silly now.  I swear to you.  Nothing is dumping.  Don't be silly.  She's just the whole thing.  All right, do not.  First of all, yeah, go to break.  Don't take a phone call.  No, let's go home.  Do not take a phone call.  Well, there's a lot of phone calls, though, Ed.  There's someone that's cold in the D.  I swear I'm going to hang up.  I'll smash the phones.  Let's just see what Todd in the D has to say. 
[00:22:30]  No, how about we don't?  I will take a club and, like Quint, smash the radio on the Orca.  I will smash the phone system.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a good thing I didn't, because I was going to go off on a little, like one curse,  but no cursing.  I sensed something was amiss.  How about a little one?  Darn.  What's a little curse?  We are really taking a chance just talking like this.  How are we taking a chance?  Oh.  We're just going to break. 
[00:23:00]  We're going to break anyway.  It's 25 minutes after the hour.  Poopy.  Wait, someone is...  Oh, wait.  We can't take a call.  Don't take a call.  I swear.  You know these smart asses will just...  All right.  Give me a phone so I can learn something out.  Give me a phone so I can at least listen to what they have to say.  It won't be on the air.  How do I get that guy without...  Go over there.  We'll put the mic on in there.  How is there no dump?  Because this place is falling apart.  Because we're working in one. 
[00:23:30]  You think we're kidding with what we're saying?  Corporate fired a ton of people hoping that no one would notice, but this is the other side of it.  Things are breaking down and there's no one around to really fix and take care of this stuff anymore.  K.P.  Cap Shaw is saying, I hope Louis C.K. stops in.  Oh, that would be beautiful.  That would be beautiful.  Um, what's up, Steve?  Um...  Without cursing.  Oh, then forget it. 
[00:24:00]  Uh, we are...  That's for you.  Yes.  Uh, we're almost good to go at the other studio if you wanted to.  Uh, we're...  The dump thing is kind of an issue, though.  Does the dump...  Yeah, the dump not working.  The dump works over there, but now all of a sudden you're dealing with the dump not working here.  But you can't do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'd have to run a best of it at CBS.  So, how does the dump not work?  Take a break.  I want to run down and talk to...  Yeah, they might be able to reset the dump system.  So, if we take a break, we can give it a shot. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, and your dilette isn't working over there?  Yeah.  Wow, this is a sinking ship.  I told you!  When is the water going to just start pouring in?  I got a funny joke.  Yes.  Seems like there's ghosts in the machines.  Oh, Jimmy!  Jimmy!  I told you.  I told you.  I told you.  I told you.  This really is just coming apart at the seams.  The Titanic.  It is the Titanic.  We're just...  We're sinking.  I'm ready to send out...  Go to break.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[00:25:00]  Iceberg struck.  So, how do we solve...  Are we going to ever solve these problems, or we just...  Iceberg, right ahead!  What do we do?  Steve, what's going on?  Yes.  I'm still gay.  That's not true.  They do realize that we broadcast to the world now, right?  The world is here on this.  We could go over across the street, do a show just fine,  but the issue over here is the dump. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it's the dump.  And especially if we go over there, it's just the second we set foot in there,  we start cursing.  You don't know what it is.  Pavlov's potty mouth.  We can at least say the words that are FCC-friendly that they dump out of.  I don't think so.  I wouldn't say anything.  I wouldn't say a word.  Why?  They're obviously not listening.  We can't have a political discussion because of me.  Yeah.  Let's see. 
[00:26:00]  We can't talk anything about our relationship with girls and things as such  because that always gets into some kind of frisky commentary.  Yeah.  Let's see.  All right.  We might be here when we get back.  Take a break.  I want to go down the hall and see what that is.  There's a very good possibility we might just not be here.  Simple as that.  Without a dump.  The Opie and Anthony show without a dump is crazy.  Yeah.  It's crazy because our listeners are a bunch of idiots.  They will just call in just to curse. 
[00:26:30]  They'll do what we encourage them to do on other shows.  Exactly.  They're animals.  I've got a lot to do anyway, so maybe we just take the day off.  I'm glad I don't have that certain Tourette's where you just blurt out curse.  What?  Weren't you talking about Thursday as a day that you might have needed to?  I needed to take the day off, but you know.  It's one of those Jewish holidays, is it?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Why are we still talking?  It's 29 and 10.  Because it doesn't matter.  I know.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going down the hall.  We don't need to follow any stupid rules or format. 
[00:27:00]  It doesn't matter.  I'm going down the hall.  None of this matters anymore.  It really doesn't.  It doesn't.  It'll drive yourself crazy if you worry about this.  Because you learn if the bosses don't care, then you really shouldn't care anymore.  Wow.  We can't even go to break.  Are you serious?  We can't even go to break.  No way.  Yes, he was. 
[00:27:30]  We can't even go to break.  No, I know you are.  We can't go to break.  We can't even go to break.  Someone wake us all up.  This has got to be some kind of nightmare.  This is one of those radio nightmares that radio people have.  Like, you can't get to the song quick enough or something.  We can't go to break?  Do you want to try it again?  Yeah.  Try it again.  What do you mean, yeah, we can?  We just tried, Steve, and we couldn't.  Can we do it now?  All right.  Let's try.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Stick with us.  This could be our last broadcast.  I'm serious.  Totally serious.  Because little things are just breaking down in front of our eyes.  Little things, like microphones, radio station. 
[00:28:30]  There's so much dust on this board, I see spiders.  Yeah.  Actual spiders are kind of hanging out and living on this wooden board of ours.  That's good.  Where are we at?  Well, of course, my mic was screwed.  Hang on.  Ow, I can't hear me.  Yeah, my mic was screwed again.  And then there's the buzz in the background.  And then a panic. 
[00:29:00]  A panic.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm just going to.  I'm going to run into the main area.  I just want to talk.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  So then a panic happened.  People came running in and said that the dump was broken. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And we had no delay, which means the show was going out completely live.  And people curse on this show a lot.  Let me jump in, though.  So the coincidence of that, just amazing, because you were this close to just mother-effing  this entire place.  And then the guy that called up, and I was yelling at him, calling his mother a whore  and everything like that.  You didn't curse once.  Yeah.  And I don't know why I didn't curse.  Yeah.  You were ready to just go off on one of those tangents.  And when I'm mad like that, I just, I can't help it. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  But for some reason, I think there was divine intervention.  It didn't happen.  I didn't curse.  And now we've got to find out if the dump works.  Yeah.  So let's.  Can you test the dump by saying the N-word?  All right.  I just heard someone yell, no, from down the hall.  That's hilarious.  Who said no?  Everybody.  Everybody.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  Why is everyone in a panic?  I'm going to do it that way.  Oh, I know why.  Because you guys don't have FU money yet.  Here it goes.  Ready?  The N-word.  What?  All right.  Let's see.  I think we've got to wait like 16 seconds or so to see if that actually works.  Were they supposed to dump out of that?  Yeah.  All right.  Of course.  Jiven's going to do his job.  Let's move back to Boston.  How's BCN Studios?  Jiven lost his mind.  Because we were there for the show.  Yeah.  Maybe we move back.  Thumbs up.  We got the dump back. 
[00:31:00]  No, we're dumping.  So now should we really test it?  No.  Let's not.  Why?  Just in case.  But you got to go through another set of tests.  Just because it works once doesn't mean it's going to work again.  All right.  Let me try one.  No.  We could.  Let Jimmy try one.  If something ever slipped legitimately during a time when because of mechanical breakdown  the dump didn't work and it wasn't really bad, I think we might be able to get away with 
[00:31:30]  that and slide.  But if we do shenanigans like, all right, let's test this, then we're in big trouble.  But little Jimmy wants to test it.  All right, Jimmy.  I'll say my favorite word.  Uh-oh.  Here it is.  It's not dirty.  No?  No, but it's my favorite word.  Okay.  Turtle dove.  Ugh.  That offends me.  I'm just going to insult you all day.  Don't take it personally, Jimmy.  That's my favorite word.  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:00]  Look who came by to say hi to us today.  Otto and George.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Wow.  Well, that's good.  They got some stuff fixed 45 minutes into our radio show.  Thanks.  That was a biggie, having that down for a while.  They do realize we're not their part-time weekender, right?  Yeah.  Take care of us.  Weekend shift, guys.  That's us.  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:30]  You know, I and I.  I'll just go with the and I thing.  We've been at this 14 years together.  Yeah.  We're dreaming of one day just, I don't know, one day where a company takes care of us and  gives us total respect.  That'd be something.  Can you imagine?  Would that be amazing?  Where we broadcast from an amazing studio with brand new technology, and maybe they market  the show, actually.  Mm-hmm.  Let's think about that for a second. 
[00:33:00]  Let me just ponder that.  Ah.  Oh, I smiled.  Yeah.  Wow.  For the first time in I don't know how long.  Oh, gosh.  We just continue to be dumped on.  We still have to walk between two stations every morning.  Why?  Yeah.  When one of them doesn't work, logically, wouldn't this company go, look, we can't afford  to keep up the studio.  We can't afford new boards and microphones and stuff for you.  So why don't you go to the other joint and we'll just pick up the feed? 
[00:33:30]  You're more of a pick up a feed type of company.  But no, we have to walk from this crap hole to actually a place that is really nice.  I wonder if it works out on paper.  I wonder if the big wigs, those people with the gigantic wigs, they look at the paper and  go, wow, we're saving so much money.  Look at our bottom line and everything.  Even though they have no clue how it's just decimating everything. 
[00:34:00]  Well, if at least it's working out on paper with the accountants and the bean counters,  as they call them.  You think they actually count beans?  Yeah.  At this point, that's probably the only revenue this company has coming in.  Beans.  Louie beans.  Louie beans.  It's this guy, Louie beans.  John, you're right, John.  You're always right.  What's the wrong emotion and reflection everywhere?  Horrible.  He's got Louie beans for teeth. 
[00:34:30]  Do we know how he did after his teeth got pulled?  Oh, did we put the picture up?  I would like to.  What happened?  My web connection is down.  Oh, no.  Is our internet on the front?  Your web connection is down, too.  This is amazing.  It's like a total breakdown of society in here.  This is what it would be like if just like everything broke down in society.  We'd all just become like yelling at each other.  What did you just say?  Oh, if everything broke down in society. 
[00:35:00]  I was saying that for no reason.  We're just your lousy scapegoat.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  You're a whole sick society.  Society.  That's who's guilty, man.  All right, well, this is what happened last night.  Another pitch on three and two.  Crawford pops it up.  Down the left field line and foul territory. 
[00:35:30]  And the Phillies take game one.  Pedro Feliz backpedaling to squeeze it.  And it's a 3-2 final.  Wow, that was exciting.  I want to thank Major League Baseball.  When did the game end?  Two in the morning?  Way to market your sport, you dopes.  Who could stay up for these games if your team's not in it?  If you're not a Phillies fan or a Raiders fan, why would you stay up until 1.30, two in the morning to watch a World Series game?  I heard the first pitch was like 8.45, something like that. 
[00:36:00]  Yep.  Don't they realize people have to work?  Do they do that for West Coast?  They're trying to figure it out.  But, I mean, sports radio and the sports columnists, they've been bitching about this for years.  Who's watching this on the West Coast?  Like, all right, obviously Philly is interested and some, you know, I don't know.  I know our regular Philly callers, they're not calling yet because they're sleeping.  They had to stay up because it's their team.  I get it.  In Tampa, some of the people stayed up because most of their city don't care. 
[00:36:30]  I think anyone in L.A. is watching this game.  I would love to see the ratings of people in Los Angeles.  Zero point zero.  Mr. Blue.  What time did the game end?  Travis, what time did the game end?  Well after midnight.  These games are easily four hours.  I don't know.  You were asleep.  Remember the days when we were growing up, a baseball game was an hour and a half to two hours?  I'm serious.  Two and a half hours if it went into extra innings?  You figure a game is roughly three hours long, so it had to at least... 
[00:37:00]  No, a regular game is three hours long.  World Series games, they take a few seconds between every pitch and really slow the action down.  Yeah, more commercial time.  Right.  They'll show the seventh inning stretch, whatever.  So yeah, probably around midnight.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was sound asleep.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, you got coffee.  I have an iced coffee.  Nice.  Can I see your iced coffee?  No.  What are you going to do with this?  Opie can't see anything.  You're not going to hold it up?  No one gives Opie anything to see.  Anymore. 
[00:37:30]  Can I have that marshmallow or that sponge or that soft?  Yes, you can.  There you go.  Take it.  Can I have that little rubber ball?  Sure.  Can I have that glass unicorn?  No.  Never.  Yeah, it was after midnight.  The last out of the night.  Going to let it all hang out?  Oh, nice.  Yes.  Hey, you got the mayor's betting, you know, because it's the World Series.  Oh, so the mayors of each city have to bet things that their cities are known for.  Gee, I wonder.  Philly? 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to guess.  Hate crimes?  I was just going to say, a cop will come down and bludgeon any five people in Tampa that the mayor wants.  Yeah.  The cops will come in and blow up a city block.  And Tampa, in bed, that if they win, Philly has to let someone get smashed in the face with a ray and killed on a boat.  Remember that lady?  Yes.  That stupid lady getting our head in the way of a ray.  What is that coming at me quickly?  This is what the mayors bet.  I mean, this is just, it doesn't get better than this right here, guys. 
[00:38:30]  Well, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and some mayors in Florida are making the games a little bit worth their while.  Yeah, they've placed a friendly...  Are they really making it a little bit worth their while?  That makes it interesting when you bet.  Oh, these anchors just suck.  A little bit worth their while.  Yeah, they've placed a friendly wager on the World Series.  Really?  Should the Phillies win it all, the mayors of Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater will ship a Florida beach picnic up north.  That includes coconut shrimp, stone crab claws, Cuban sandwiches, cigars. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, and get this, key lime pie.  Oh, and get this.  Get this.  She actually went, oh.  And get this.  Yeah.  Because here it comes, the biggie.  It's the year 2008.  We're not living in the Old West.  Guess what?  They could get all that crap in Philly already.  They can actually ship it up.  Get rid of the dumb mayor bet thing.  It doesn't work anymore.  Unless it was interesting.  We'll go wagon.  Like fricassee pig testicles.  A bucket of them. 
[00:39:30]  It's a big treat in town.  A giant bucket.  Fricassee pig testicles.  Yeah, why can't a mayor have a sense of humor and just offer something just horrendous?  And why did this tradition start?  Something horrific from your town.  I don't know.  Oh, get Googling.  I would love to.  It was the first mayoral wager.  Are you still getting paid?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Are we?  I don't even know if we're still getting paid.  I don't know.  I just come here because they tell me.  You know, we're probably not even getting paid anymore.  Bob's going to call us.  Oh, guys.  I just found out you haven't been paid in six months. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, guys.  Oh, God.  We're going to have to take him to court.  Oh, my God.  Like that guy in office space.  My stabler.  Yeah.  Can you find out why the mayor thing started and why we continue to do it when no one gives  a crap?  What's Philly betting a bunch of cheesesteaks?  It's got to be.  Oh, you know damn well the cheesesteaks are on the line, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But they can buy them there.  I know.  Get this key lime pie.  Mmm.  How bad.  And if the Rays manage to swipe the security from the fighting room, Mayor Nutter, I should  say, we'll ship the floor to Mayor's cheesesteaks, tasty cakes, soft pretzels, mac and cheese, 
[00:40:30]  and a rocky statue.  No losers in that bed.  No, no.  Jesus.  They should like have.  Goddamn Philly.  They handle the problems differently now.  They should wager like a public stoning in the town square or something.  Just something horrendous.  We lose.  We'll send one of our fans to your town square and you can stone him to death. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Wait, what was the last part?  Were they making fun of the fact there's no beer or something?  Mayor Nutter, I should say, we'll ship the floor to Mayor's cheesesteaks, tasty cakes,  soft pretzels, mac and cheese, and a rocky statue.  No losers in that bed, it sounds like.  No, no.  No losers in that bed, it sounds like.  Doesn't sound like that.  The Rocky.  Rocky Dennis.  Big head.  Yeah.  No losers, because it's all tasty food.  Big cheekbones to slap as you walk by. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, God.  The truck's all weighed down from that giant head.  Yeah.  A map with pins that can be removed and the statue cries.  It's a really interactive statue.  With a crying share when she goes to wake him up.  That dummy's lazy.  He ain't getting up today.  Blind people come over and just feel it.  Recoil in horror.  Rocky Dennis.  Why?  Because he's silly looking.  You know what?  I know what will make us feel better today. 
[00:42:00]  Let's beat up Scott and Todd after the break.  It is Jocktober.  Jocktober.  These dopes.  They're, oh, one of our favorites for Jocktober, because every day just brings so much hackiness.  Yeah.  It's obvious we're coming to the end of Jocktober if we're up to the Scott and Todd thing.  Because, you know, now we're talking about the grand finale.  We're getting there.  You know, fireworks are getting bigger.  What?  The mic.  No, no.  Don't throw it.  The mic just went limp right in front of his face as he's talking. 
[00:42:30]  It needs some Cialis.  Oh, good gravy.  Stump brain, remember when I bitched about this, too?  Yeah, I'm glad this is.  Yep.  All right, watch.  See, the thing is, Opie's microphone is on a boom that is akin to the shuttle's mechanical arm.  Right.  It's, it's, how long is that thing?  It's five feet long.  They have to tighten these screws every other day. 
[00:43:00]  And I said, please get rid of this.  Just move the mount.  And get another wood block, because you have a lot of wood around this joint.  And put a wood block here with a little, little, little arm.  A little arm.  So it's not, there's one, two, three, four, five, six joints on that arm.  Yeah.  Six different articulating joints on the arm.  Why?  And I have two.  Just in case I want to broadcast from way back here.  Who cares? 
[00:43:30]  This is, this is silly.  This place is silly.  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old.  I need respect.  Don't even, I, I just would like one or two things to work.  Respect.  That went out the window.  I, I did, I don't even expect it.  There it goes.  Can you fix my mic, please?  Get some duct tape.  I will.  Well, usually I go like this, and this is not.  But then the, no, the wire's going to rip out now. 
[00:44:00]  Uh-oh.  Now you did it.  My mic's good.  I think you just ripped the wire out by spinning it around the, the mic thing.  But I, I.  Oh, it looks like Anthony's going to be doing the reads now.  I just broke the mic.  You totally broke the mic now.  Hold on.  Because I ain't paying for this.  That's a tough one because that's the cord.  So I had to pay for the DVD player.  Listen to me.  That's what I had to do.  To tighten.  For the last few months.  Why are you still talking into that useless thing?  Might as well talk into this.  Let me unzip. 
[00:44:30]  Let it be known that.  Yes.  That's what I had to do day after day after day is, can you explain this?  Wrap the wire around tightly so this thing doesn't flop.  Yeah, but the wire finally snapped.  And the wire finally snapped live on the air.  So there you go.  I bitched about that for months, too.  Oh, yeah.  Look, look.  Now we see it.  But see, I.  Oh, oops.  You're going to get electrocuted.  Nah, it's low voltage.  Very low voltage.  We got Kevin Smith coming in a little while.  Yeah, I'm excited about that. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Wow, that whole wire's got to be replaced.  And that's like one of those five-foot wires in my course.  Great.  All right.  I'm not paying for that one, by the way.  Because that's that one I bitched about forever and said, look.  I have to wrap the wire tightly so the mic doesn't flop down.  So I can talk into it.  I refuse to pay for that one.  Sorry.  Now I've always got to use the guest mic and stand up two feet away from the monitors.  You're going to get testicular cancer standing close. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, God.  This place is.  Hold on.  It's like a fun house.  Did you dream that 14 years into this, this is what it would come down to?  Dude, I thought we'd be.  Did you think by now we'd be broadcasting from the space shuttle?  Yes.  And we'd be broadcasting to the universe?  Can't you use this one?  Maybe they could feed me a guest, a loose mic.  Feed you.  No, Jimmy, that's your mic.  I don't care.  Just give me another one.  No, Jimmy, you earned that.  That'll be fixed in no time.  You earned that mic, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  You earned that.  Now there's a big coil of wire. 
[00:46:00]  Tim's going to have a nervous breakdown.  Poor Tim.  I know.  He really is.  We're keeping Tim on his toes today.  Yeah.  There you go.  Now it's done.  Now you're done.  You just got that thing that might smack you in the face every so often.  Yeah, I'll fix it in the brake.  Is that safe?  Yeah.  It'll be fair.  It's low voltage.  I never thought I'd have to say, is that safe?  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  It's safe.  You wouldn't believe it.  It's just so safe.  Don't fight my changers.  Very careful.  We changed his tune quick.  He certainly did.  And look, it doesn't turn. 
[00:46:30]  So why wasn't this fixed like a long time ago?  Now it's all nice.  I think the wire itself is acting like a spring that would turn it back.  All right.  We're going to take another break.  You're going to put your eye out on that thing.  What's working and what's not right now?  Your mic's working pretty good.  Yeah, I'm all right.  All right.  My mic is back working.  That's good.  That's not working?  The buzz is working good.  Yeah, the buzz is like.  The buzz is strong.  Yeah, I like that.  The buzz is making me dizzy.  It keeps me awake, which is good.  I wanted to play some really awesome circus music during that whole exchange, but I can't 
[00:47:00]  play anything.  We like when Danny throws music in, but for some reason we can't get to the dilette, which  is the system we use for music, and that's now broken.  This is just, it's a goof, right?  And our agent just continues to sleep away day after day.  What is he doing?  Get on the phone and start cracking some skulls.  This reminds me of my Murphy's Law poster I have hanging in my room.  Oh, do you got that one?  If it can go wrong, it will go wrong. 
[00:47:30]  Murphy's Law number one.  Yeah, exactly.  The condom will break.  Yeah, if you come in the salt, you will leave a hair at the scene.  It'd be great if it was all things like that.  Just all horrible rape things.  If you're drunk driving, you will.  Yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut has a very good idea.  I'm going to take your idea and take it a little further.  This is kind of a Lord of the Flies thing happening here, right?  Yeah.  There is another studio right outside that door. 
[00:48:00]  Let's make some homemade weapons and take over their space.  Oh, we'll just crack their skulls open.  Tell them to beat it stupid, and we'll just do our show for another frequency today.  Oh, you mean the CBS station?  Yeah, those mic stands over there, that's a good weapon.  So right before we do it, we tell everybody to tune in to that station, and we run in  and bludgeon them with mic stands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thigh bones.  Stunt brain, we'll follow you into there.  I don't think they have a dump button over there. 
[00:48:30]  Who gives a crap?  Get some homemade weapons.  We'll take over their dump space next.  Who needs homemade?  Kenny?  Ixnay on what we might have.  Ant?  May, whatever.  Just Ixnay.  We'll go with the homemade weapons today.  I'm in for the cause.  Yeah, the stapler gun could work.  I'm serious.  We should just rip those idiots out of there.  What are they doing?  Jukebox crap anyway, right?  Yeah, well, it's too bad. 
[00:49:00]  What dumb song are they playing to make them believe they're important in this business?  Too bad it's not tomorrow, because Dan's doing the weather at the WB.  I don't even know who Dan is.  You've been saying that all morning.  Who's Dan?  Dan Taylor.  I don't know who Dan Taylor is.  We've been doing radio in New York for 10 years.  Grew up listening to New York radio.  Who the hell is Dan Taylor?  He's a guy you would not have listened to.  But he's been on for a while.  Is he part of the old-time radio convention that's happening in Newark?  I think so.  Wow.  Exciting. 
[00:49:30]  They're worthless.  O.P. and Anthony.  Rock and roll.  O.P. Anthony, Jim Norton.  I Hate Your Guts, the new book from Jim Norton.  Moving up the charts.  Climbing up the charts.  Amazon.com.  Pre-ordering is happening.  We were 18 last night.  Do you know how good that is?  I mean, it's amazing for a pre-order to happen. 
[00:50:00]  Really good.  It's awesome, Jimmy.  You're heading to big things.  Just remember us, because we'll be stuck in this S-hole as you become bigger and bigger.  I'm not going anywhere.  We're going to rot here as you become a big, huge movie star.  I'm not going.  I can't act.  I can write.  I can't act.  Lucky us.  We get to rot, and Jimmy's star continues to get bigger and bigger.  Brighter and brighter.  And we can't even get a radio company to show us a little respect.  It's going to happen, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  You're going to be in movies.  You're going to be huge.  A man who is destined for greatness.  Yeah, it's obvious.  In one way or another.  Just throw us a bone and give us a walk-on part where we just stare at the camera awkwardly.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Hupkin.  Right.  Big thanks for Jimmy.  You watch.  This is his year coming up.  Hey, Kevin Smith's going to be here.  Yes.  He wanted to do the whole show, and then he flew in at four in the morning or something. 
[00:51:00]  His arms are killing him.  You know?  That's so funny.  Why?  Is there something wrong with you?  I'm messing the plane?  Oh, literal, Jimmy.  I was pointing out to Anthony because people don't believe us.  There's a wood board in front of us.  Technology shouldn't be made out of wood.  We've made that point.  This mic broke.  My mic broke today live on the air.  Anthony's mic didn't work to start the show.  We don't have a computer.  The dump button kind of blanked the bed.  I think it's working now. 
[00:51:30]  We're not going to really test that.  Because knowing corporate, they'll fire us because their dump button doesn't work because they didn't keep the maintenance up.  That's how that would work, by the way.  If they went on a rant and started cursing, which we do from time to time, and the dump button didn't work, it'd be all over the papers tomorrow and all over TV.  And then the company would fire us because they didn't do the right thing and make sure this equipment worked properly.  That's how they work.  And then I'm looking around the studio. 
[00:52:00]  You think we're working around old equipment?  Look behind you, man.  That thing has been sitting there for months.  It's an old school TV.  Dude, it has rabbit ears.  It has rabbit ears.  It has a TV slash VCR combo.  Remember those?  Wow, were you sporting.  Where the VCR is attached to the TV, above the TV.  It's one unit.  Yeah.  And like Ann said, it has rabbit ears.  Get me a brick.  I want to see what happens when you bust one of those things. 
[00:52:30]  What, are you going to make me pay 89 cents for that thing?  That'll make a loud popping noise.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, give me some goggles and get me a brick.  And glass shards would probably go everywhere.  We need a tarp.  No, we don't need a tarp.  Set up a big gag.  Yeah, we're not.  Just get me an effing brick.  You're going to get a brick.  Well, first listener to the station with a brick.  ACDC. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, we're looking for a brick, everybody.  We have a Halloween party to mention.  Oh.  October 31st on Halloween.  Yes.  The O.B. Anthony Halloween party.  It's 7 to 10 p.m.  You know, good hours.  Good hours.  The O&A character costume contest.  You come dressed as your favorite O.B.  Anthony show character.  Best contest wins a cash prize.  Nice.  And they put cash all in caps.  Nice.  I guess you're supposed to say it.  Best contest wins a cash prize.  First 500 people get in, so you can line up early if you want to. 
[00:53:30]  And go to onaradio.com, opianathony.com for information.  Cool.  I also want to take this opportunity.  The morning started out very nice for me in the office.  Yeah.  I want to thank Brian Rickers.  Why?  Because usually, you know, the crap we get in our office.  I come in every morning, greet it to some box or some, well, no, literally a cardboard box.  It would be very nice if there was just some box in the office on my desk.  But a box, and usually it's garbage, some kind of promotional thing. 
[00:54:00]  But Brian sent me a copy of Grey's Sports Almanac.  Yeah?  Yes.  It's wonderful.  So who's going to win the World Series?  Well, it only goes up to 2000.  So it's not really helping me much unless I could go back in time and use it.  Or at least go to, you know, 1985 or something.  Yeah.  But it's just an accurate, and it's got the receipt in it and everything. 
[00:54:30]  And he wrote a little note telling me, you know, if some kid or some wild-eyed guy claiming  to be a scientist shows up, take care of them.  Can I ask you something?  Yes.  Now, that's obviously a very cool gift from one of our listeners.  Yeah.  You're a big Back to the Future fan.  Yes.  And it's cool for today.  What do you do with that tomorrow?  I'm going to put it in my Back to the Future collection.  Oh, you got one?  Well, now I have a lot of people who have been sending me stuff.  So I have the little ring, the graduation ring.  Okay.  And from Hill Valley. 
[00:55:00]  Uh-huh.  And I got my sports almanac.  Uh-huh.  And I'm probably going to end up buying a DeLorean at some point in my life.  Uh-huh.  It's going to be funny.  Yeah.  Danny, you want to drive that one?  See, that's it right there.  Yeah, nice.  Hey, are your computers working?  My computer works.  But not that one?  I'm going to go to the Fifth Town Museum.  No bones from Pennsylvania.  Rabbit ears.  You do realize in February you may lose your signal as our stations switch to digital broadcasting. 
[00:55:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  And then he writes, Jesus.  Well, I'll go with the JC today so the religious people can relax.  JC, isn't broadcasting part of CBS's name?  Yeah, apparently.  We are owned by CBS and we're looking at one of the oldest TVs in existence.  Yeah.  That has to be.  With rabbit ears.  That TV probably at one point showed the Texaco Theater. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, if you're thanking people, I want to thank one of the brown nosers that works for us.  He bought me a Pumpsy Green rookie card.  Wow.  We were talking about Pumpsy Green.  He was...  A Pumpsy Green rookie card.  What was it?  We're talking one of the first f***s ever to play baseball for Boston.  We're talking the original f***er that played ball for Boston. 
[00:56:30]  Come on, people.  Be dialing.  Be dialing.  That's why you got to listen every day.  You're going to love it.  Pumpsy Green.  We did a whole Pumpsy Green thing about two weeks ago.  He's not even green.  He's f***ing as the ace of f***ing.  You know how...  They were so racist.  Like, for the black people, we've come a long way.  Let's be honest with each other.  So you can start relaxing a little bit. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  I'm looking at Pumpsy...  Let's your hair down.  I'm looking at Pumpsy Green's rookie card.  Yeah.  And he's got the Boston Red Sox cap on.  And what is his story again?  I forgot.  After Jackie Robinson, 15 years later or something, the Red Sox finally got their first black guy.  12 years.  12 years later, they finally got their first black player.  And it was Pumpsy Green.  And they were the last team to integrate.  Yeah.  Hardcore Boston sports fans know this.  I was looking at Pumpsy Green's rookie card.  And a lot of people grew up with their baseball cards, right?  And do you remember the ones where they had little cartoons on them?  A little, yeah, cartoon drawing of the player on the back. 
[00:57:30]  Well, on the back of Pumpsy Green's card, it says, time for a switch.  Turns out old Pumpsy was a switch hitter.  Pumpsy is the first switch hitting regular in the Red Sox lineup in 27 years.  Mm-hmm.  The problem is, they draw...  They supposed to hit her wrong?  They draw Pumpsy as a white guy on the back of his baseball card.  Ah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:58:00]  That is odd.  There's a guy that says, I don't know how to draw black people.  There's a guy that says, back then, what am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  Pumpsy.  They had that color on the Divex?  Yeah, we don't even have it.  I really don't know why I don't have my brick yet, Stump Brain.  That thing is going to blow up nice later.  We want to try to start the Jocktober with Scott and Todd?  Please.  All right, where's Sam?  Bring in Sam.  Sam.  We love Jocktober.  It's about time we feature Scott and Todd. 
[00:58:30]  God, they are guilty of so much of this hack radio crap that we make fun of.  Song parodies are good, though.  I'm sure they have a nice studio, though.  I'm sure they get more respect than us.  Yeah.  They do.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Be aware out there today, there seems to be something in the air besides the fall weather here. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Would you just kill yourself?  I would go home and just swallow a shotgun.  Back up the crapola, it's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  I love that.  I think that's funny.  That is funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:59:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  What?  There was no joy attached to that.  No.  I'm getting a Ron and Fez spy report.  Oh, really?  Because I love their spy report bits, so give them a little plug.  The Ron and Fez spy report.  What are you doing?  Just trying to turn my headphones up.  I believe they cranked up all the way.  What happened?  Never mind.  Anything I touch, I'm just trying to fix.  You know what?  Hold on.  Jimmy, give your book a promotion or something, because I want to do this right. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, it's not all about me, or I hate your guts.  Yeah, just give a nice plug.  I've got to write something to Anthony.  Which you can pick up on Amazon.com in the pre-sale.  I could probably talk about other things, but I'm a self-centered ass.  I'll yap about my book.  I was reading it last night and laughing out loud.  I'm like, who wrote this?  Oh, it was me.  It is LOL reading.  I must say, you will laugh out loud.  Hey, did you watch any more wires yet, or are you still on the first three?  No, yesterday I went to sleep very early.  I have.  Got up and zeroed in my laser sight on my .45. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, nice.  Nice, healthy, productive knife.  That's good.  And this is the spy report.  I want to do it the right way.  Really?  Yeah.  When did that happen?  It's happening right now.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll explain in a second.  Opie and Anthony.  What a weird morning.  Kevin Smith should be joining the program.  He'll bring some sanity today, that's for sure. 
[01:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's got a book, man.  It's moving up the charts.  Pre-order right now for I Hate Your Guts on Amazon.com.  Thank you.  It moved up like 20 places overnight.  It was unbelievable.  It's up to eight or nine or something?  No.  We went to 18.  18, I mean.  Being in the top 100 is fantastic on Amazon.  It's huge.  The book comes out in just under two weeks.  You know what's more amazing?  We're looking to Kevin Smith to bring sanity to the show.  Oh, I know.  How is that possible? 
[01:01:30]  I know.  The man wears shorts in five degree weather.  He's smoked.  He's a creep.  He rules.  Kevin Smith rules.  He's just one of those guys.  He was never affected by the fame in Hollywood and stuff.  We met him and we hit it off with the guy.  He doesn't just come in for a quick 10-minute interview and then a publicist drags him off.  When he's in New York, he wants to do our entire show.  We're like, you sure?  He goes, yeah, man.  I want to go to the end with you guys.  He was supposed to be here at six.  That messes up that whole thing. 
[01:02:00]  But he did.  He took a red eye or something.  Got in at around four and full rolling.  He needs to sleep for a couple hours.  We joked about him putting me in a movie.  Like, yeah, we're just never going to happen.  Yeah.  Then he starts shooting Zach and Mary make a porno.  And lo and behold.  You're in it.  A couple lines.  He was a man of his word.  It was like, he took really good care of him.  Yeah, very cool.  The Ron and Fez spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  We got a lot of people calling and instant feedback saying that Howard has Ant's ex-divorce lawyer. 
[01:02:30]  That fat slob Dominic.  Oh, Dominic?  That fat slob Dominic was on Howard's show talking about your divorce, Anthony.  Oh, he was?  Yeah.  So we're trying to figure out what he said.  What was he saying?  No surprises there.  I pretty much spilled everything out on my show.  Yeah.  Not pretty much.  I did.  Looks like Fat Boy needs some publicity, huh?  So, yeah, I wonder what he was saying.  Hmm.  Wow.  I don't think a lawyer should be going on a radio show talking about, you know, cases. 
[01:03:00]  No.  That's pretty interesting.  Especially when I get a settlement paper on things that says, please do not talk about  this on the air.  Right.  So I've been, you know, I've kept up my side and haven't talked about the latest shenanigans  and how that was disposed of.  So maybe he should just shut his fat yap, you publicity-seeking douche.  What could he say?  And, you know, his wife should share in this. 
[01:03:30]  Really?  What was said?  Anybody know?  No idea.  No idea.  We're trying to get to the bottom of it.  I don't know what was...  I'll reserve judgment until I hear what was said.  Not judgment on my feelings towards Dominic because I can't stand him.  I hate that guy.  As a lawyer, I can't stand him.  As a person, I can't stand him.  I saw him in Atlantic City. 
[01:04:00]  And he comes up and starts talking to me like we're pals or something.  Hey, how you doing?  Big smile.  It's like I'm trying to eat, which you look like you do a lot of anyway.  Why don't you join me somewhere else?  Join me at the table across the restaurant.  Yeah.  Andre, New Jersey.  How are you?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, man.  It's a weird day.  I heard this thing on Howard.  It was right before you guys went to commercials. 
[01:04:30]  And, you know, Dominic mentioned he said a radio guy.  And they were just talking about divorces.  And, you know, he did mention that he worked for, you know, Sirius XM.  So if you're familiar with the show, you know it was Anthony.  But he didn't mention you.  And basically, Howard didn't say a word because, you know, I don't think he wants to get into a fight.  I think the whole glass houses thing, I bet he wanted to change the subject pretty quick.  Because everything, dude, everything about my divorce is known. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, I never kept anything off the air as far as, except for, you know, legal things.  I can't sit there and talk ill of somebody.  I can't say bad things about it.  I could tell the truth about my life being married to somebody because that's what I do for a job.  I come in here and I talk about my life.  So I'm allowed to do that.  But I can't disparage people and all that kind of garbage. 
[01:05:30]  But there's no secrets.  It was in the newspapers.  You know, it just, it's not like anybody can come out and drop an A-bomb about anything.  But, you know, I'm sure Howard knew to not jump in there and get on any pile on because there's probably some skeletons that could be dredged up.  But water under the bridge.  They were talking about the Madonna divorce and he was saying it's not fair that Guy Ritchie is going to get half of Madonna's. 
[01:06:00]  And he was saying, like, you know, if somebody's wife was like a waitress, which maybe yours was or whatever, that she isn't entitled to half of your future earnings.  Who said that?  Howard.  And then what did Fatso say?  He didn't say anything.  No, she is entitled as long as she's my client.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But I think he feels your pain, you know.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:06:30]  You know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah.  No, okay.  As long as Howie understands, you know, he knows.  He went through a divorce.  I'm sure he wasn't happy about giving his money away as much as I wasn't giving mine away.  Stupid marriage.  Sorry.  Sorry, Ope.  It's all right.  But, you know.  I figured I'd give it a shot.  It's an institution I just cannot embrace.  I figured I'd give it a shot.  Are you looking forward to it, though?  Oh, yeah.  I'm stoked.  It's going to happen soon, too, man. 
[01:07:00]  Holy crap.  I will be married by the end of the year.  That's crazy to me.  Hey, where's Sam?  Wow.  I need my tuxedo.  I don't have a tuxedo.  Well, you're going to look like a little penguin.  Sam, let's move on.  A little egg on your feet, moving it around.  Sam.  Yeah.  We are featuring Scott and Todd today.  It's Jocktober.  I wish I knew someone that had a miscarriage.  What?  A little egg on your feet. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I was talking about the penguin movie with the egg on the feet, because Jimmy will look  like that.  I just wish off the top of my head I could come up with somebody.  Kind of might have lost something.  Oops.  You dropped something.  Stupid penguin crying over a dumb egg.  Right by your fake leg.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  Damn it.  What was the name of that penguin movie?  March of the Penguins.  Yeah.  Borefest.  Just make another one stupid. 
[01:08:00]  Stop sitting there in the cold crying over a dumb egg that's cracked.  Staring it with their dumb face, still kicking it around.  Right.  I've never wanted to open fire on anything as badly as I did all those penguins in the  cold.  What a nice, big, pink, frozen mist that would make.  Just red ice.  You could eat penguin for the next four years on the feet and gather from shooting all that.  Look, I got a wing.  That's why humans rule.  We figured out a long time ago how to get it out of that dumb tundra.  You're still stuck there.  You still can't figure out that if you just march to the south, you'll be all right all 
[01:08:30]  year long.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Enough.  Yeah.  They'll just stand there in the cold, shivering.  Yeah.  What asses?  What's wrong with you guys?  Get into a cave or dig a hole.  Relax.  Well, I'm getting more reports.  Thank you, Christopher from Connecticut.  Opie, I only heard a little bit of it, but he was just talking about how a celebrity's  wife, who has no career potential of her own at the time of marriage, can be entitled  to his potential earnings if divorced.  Yeah, that sounds familiar. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, let's talk about Scott and Todd.  We probably should move off that for now.  Party's over soon anyway.  I know.  No, no.  But you're going to throw one big party when it is over.  When the party's over, you're going to be throwing a party to celebrate the fact that  the party's over, right?  This has been, people that have kept tabs and know that this started in 1999, yeah, know  that it's been going on for quite a while.  Yeah.  So when it finally does end, and the light is so, I am so close to the end of the tunnel 
[01:09:30]  there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my God, a party.  What a party.  My house.  Yeah.  It's the Anthony gets a huge, huge raise party.  I can't even talk.  Look at me.  I'm like a McCain.  Oh, you're getting excited.  I'm all excited.  Yeah, well, that is just dumb that the courts decide when your relationship is officially  over.  Not you.  Yeah, thanks.  Not you.  You decided 98, I don't know about, I'm just guessing, somewhere in the late 90s, and you 
[01:10:00]  were done.  This was it.  Certainly do.  When you bring another girl home, that's a good signal.  But 2008, the courts haven't let you go yet.  They'll decide.  Yeah.  It's coming soon, though, Ann.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Oh, believe me, I know.  It's hard enough when you have to kind of take care of your responsibilities that you were  told you have to take care of.  It's very hard to do in certain circumstances. 
[01:10:30]  And when that responsibility is no longer on my shoulders, I will be very happy.  Right.  Very happy.  I know we're trying to move on, but my eye is now twitching because of this buzz in my  head.  Can we fix the buzz?  Yes.  Make it louder.  I don't know how to make it louder.  Let's just make it louder.  It's really loud in my head, though.  The TV keeps turning off.  Mike, our big, big flat screen TV, stunt brain has to walk by and just turn it on.  Sometimes it just shuts off.  Yeah, there's a poltergeist thing.  Someone said, this is a direct result of me getting the sports almanac. 
[01:11:00]  I did something and changed the course of history.  And now we're on some kind of parallel thing where nothing works.  To chain reaction.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  Sam?  I have to figure out what I did now.  Oh.  Did we mention the E-Roc Cruise thing yet on our show?  No.  Oh, man.  Did I have a good one?  Oh, did you?  Did you?  Yep.  I can only imagine.  It was very funny.  Yeah.  And could not be spoken.  I know what it is. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I want to tease something.  We learned last night that E-Roc loves going on cruises.  Cruises are fun.  I think he's in his late 20s, maybe 30 at this point.  And he admitted to us last night that he's been on 18 cruises.  Yeah.  And that he's a what?  A Royal Caribbean Diamond Club member.  How does he have money for 18 cruises?  He goes for free.  They use him for ballast. 
[01:12:00]  We want to just let...  A shipping joke.  Yeah.  We want to let that just sit there.  But we will get to E-Roc and the fact that he loves cruises in the very near future.  I know why he goes.  Because they owed him.  Because he hurt his back swimming under the ship.  He's going under the boat, smart E-Roc.  And he injured it on one of the propellers.  Yeah.  And what did he tell us?  Just give a little tease.  I mean, this is going to be like something we talk about for weeks.  You mean about his late night snack?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, sometimes he would like to have a couple drinks in a nice casino and then come back 
[01:12:30]  to the hotel room late at night and order a little room service and his meal of choice  was BLTs and chocolate milk.  As he watches Snow Dogs.  Yeah, as he watched Cuba Gooding Jr. and Snow Dogs.  Every night.  Wait, on cruises or on vacation?  On cruises.  No, when he goes on vacation, he goes on cruises.  It's the same thing.  Wow.  18 cruises.  That means from the time he was 12 to now, he averages one a year.  He goes out on E-Roc watching expeditions where he jumps overboard and the people sit on 
[01:13:00]  the rail watching him.  He'll actually be standing on the rail.  He'll go, where is everybody?  And they're all on the upper deck looking down at him.  Or they're all on the other side of the boat evening it out.  Photographing him.  Looking at his big calves.  Look at that.  It's the big calves retard from North America.  The socks.  The little stretchy thing in the socks is always turning them into crew socks and they  collapse around his fat ankles.  BLT and chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk just laying there in his cabin. 
[01:13:30]  Watching Snow Dogs.  Watching Snow Dogs.  I knew we shouldn't have brought this up because we want to make fun of Scott and Todd, but  we're off and running.  Liddy Rules from Wackbag.  During the conga line, do they play, he's getting fat, fat, fat.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Oh my God, Opie, I just saw the E-Rock picture on onaradio.com.  It looks like he was punched in the soul.  Oh, the ships love E-Rock because he doubles as an anchor. 
[01:14:00]  He's right now in the bathroom dropping a deuce so he cannot comment because he is doing the  same thing he symbolically does from 6 to 11.  Also, there's something else going on.  I'm being called a dope because the March of the Penguins, I said all they have to do  is like march south and it would be nice and warm, but see, they're on the South Pole.  But logically, if you could keep marching south, then officially you would be going back the 
[01:14:30]  other way.  I think the only way you can march when you're at the South Pole is north.  The north?  Yeah.  What if you turn it upside down?  What if it's a perspective thing?  All right.  It's fine by me.  I'm a dope.  Sam is trying to signal to everybody.  No, but everybody knew what you meant.  You think the Florida birds go.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I mean, I'm an expert on penguins.  Thank you.  Aren't there penguins on the North Pole?  Of course there are.  But the March of the Penguins happened on the South Pole, I guess.  Yes.  I'm obsessed, by the way, with raping an emperor penguin.  First of all, no, there aren't. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, there isn't?  On the North Pole?  No.  Of course there are.  Why isn't there penguins on the North Pole?  It's cold up there, too.  They frolic.  I believe they are only indigenous to the southern hemisphere.  Indigenous.  That doesn't make sense.  But they've been brought up there as fun things to punch when you take it a drink.  They're all alcoholics at the North Pole.  So what's up, Iraq?  Oh, Iraq.  There he is.  Hi.  Are you the only one that didn't have to wear a flotation device because they looked at  your neck and said, oh, he's already taken care of?  Danny, we realized you'd be playing like the Royal Caribbean cruise music. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, that's why we can't do this justice.  Or feeling hot, hot, hot.  Or some type of cruise music.  Uh-oh, Iraq.  Iraq, don't run over there.  We don't have a computer that works.  We're going to try to save the day.  Oh.  Iraq's going to save the day.  Oh, that's right.  The North Pole has reindeer and Santa.  I forgot.  Thank you, Kevin.  Penguin, South Pole.  North Pole has Santa and the reindeers and the elves.  Yeah.  The elves.  What's up, B-Rock?  You've been on...  No, I was just told to come in.  Yeah.  You slipped last night and told us that you've been on 18 cruises and you can't get enough 
[01:16:00]  of the cruise ship.  You love cruises.  And you're a what?  I have diamond status with Royal Caribbean cruise lines.  What does that give you?  Diamond status.  Because in the extras, he gets like concierge.  Upgrades in the room.  Upgrades.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not even a diamond member.  I've been on quite a few cruises, but free wine.  Listen to them.  Captain's Table?  There it is.  No, no, no.  Are they the highest...  Are they the best ones, Royal Caribbean?  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, pretty good.  They're the highest rate in the world.  How much is it a cruise to go on?  I want to go on.  I've driven all of it.  How much are they?  Depends on the cabin you want.  What kind of cabin do you get?  Do you want the E-Rock cabin?  Do you get a balcony and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you got it.  Look at him.  He gets all excited.  I'm diamond club.  Diamond status.  And all the plankton you can eat, right?  All the krill.  Oh, damn.  It's one of the best parts of the cruise.  What?  What?  The eating, because you never stop.  That's right.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:17:00]  Only the old people on cruises are excited about the eating part.  Oh, and the drinking.  I've been on so many cruises, and the old people love the eating.  They're at the buffet.  They go to that goddamn chocolate, midnight chocolate thing.  No, no, no.  What?  He was going on and on last night about how great the midnight buffets were.  Yeah, the midnight chocolate buffet they have.  Oh, I don't know that one.  The chocolate.  No, I don't know that one.  And it's, yes, it's insanity.  And the old people love it.  They have the big gala one. 
[01:17:30]  The younger people, or the people that like to party, go out on excursions.  They go to the beaches.  They do things like that while Iraq is just gorging himself on the boat.  No, no, no.  Well, I go out to the beaches and excursions, too.  Do you?  Yeah.  You have, like, the first...  You've seen McDonald's on every Caribbean island there is.  You have the first seating dinner, and then instead of going to the show, you go to the  casino, where they just keep giving you drinks so you stay at the table.  Sure.  And then around midnight, you stumble down to the dining room again, where they've got 
[01:18:00]  the midnight buffet.  Because there's nothing better than eating at midnight, and then going to bed.  No, no.  You still got another five hours before you go to bed.  Well, of course.  Back to the casino.  So you go back to the casino until they close it, like, at 3 a.m., and then you stumble back  to the room.  And then you're starving until five.  And you get room service.  With his BLT and chocolate milk.  Greg Brady's left over.  When Iroh gets on the ship, it's no longer a cruise.  It's a...  Oh, I didn't update.  It's a bottom trigger. 
[01:18:30]  Everyone, this is coming in way too much, but they're all telling you not to try that  Titanic move on the cruise ship.  Oh, the front.  Last night, he also said that the best part is that you can have, like, 12 meals a day  because there's, like, three places to have every meal.  So you can just keep going.  He rocked last night was a picture of gluttony.  How he was just talking about the cruise experience. 
[01:19:00]  It was just nothing but gluttony.  All about food and eating.  Tell him about the special chairs they gave you so you could just sit in the ocean with  the floating beers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Certain islands where you can just kind of sit, like, halfway in the surf there.  And they give you this floating bucket with an anchor, and you can just drop it.  So if you have your lunch or, like, Coronas and stuff, they just sit there and float right  next to you while you're in the water.  I was like a giant turd.  I'd love for a shark to bite him in half.  But he says he does this.  And I just go, I'm full. 
[01:19:30]  But he says he does this all day, and he just eats and drinks and watches people.  It's just gluttony.  He's coming up and a license plate from Tennessee comes out.  Why would you tell anyone this?  I don't know.  Why not?  Right.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Oh.  There you go.  You've been on a number.  Hands up.  I wish I could put my hands up.  Hands up.  Why?  So you go on a cruise every year, I guess.  You've been on 18, and you swear by this.  Yeah, I haven't been on in a couple years. 
[01:20:00]  But, yeah, I used to go at least once a year.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  They've been on more than I have.  So it's fun.  Yeah.  I won't disagree with you.  I love going on cruises.  They are a lot of fun.  But the eating part is, like, I go to the dinner where they seat, you know, you're seated  with everybody that you're with and stuff like that, and that's cool.  Great food.  But then once that's done, I'm done with the eating.  Yeah.  And then you go up to the pool and you drink.  Well, the drinking part.  You go out to the back and drink. 
[01:20:30]  I'm out of risk drinking.  I like the drinking part.  But the eating thing.  Oof.  Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What would be the increased price of oil?  I'm guessing Royal Caribbean's bringing him along for fuel.  What do you mean?  Like, they turn off their engines and just throw him overboard with, like, some kind of  life preserver, and he just kind of pulls the boat along.  No, I think the blubber.  Huh?  Oh, the whale blubber.  All right.  It's blubber.  There's a few ways you go with that one.  Good job.  That's just hurtful.  That is.  It is. 
[01:21:00]  Someone has a feedback.  I apologize, but it's long gone.  But they're surprised you haven't died of Legionnaire's disease yet.  The cruises you've been on.  How many times have you been sick?  Food poisoning.  Have you?  Or some of those weird diseases.  Or where you touch the doorknob with some savage touch.  And, you know, you wind up getting the runs.  I think it was just once, but when I was a kid, before you knew not to drink the water  in Mexico.  When did they not know to drink the water?  I don't know. 
[01:21:30]  When you were a kid?  When were you a kid?  I was like 13.  Pancho Villa was around?  No, you get off the...  I miss the whole lecture where they tell you not to buy the chiclets from the kids that  are by the boat and not to drink the water.  To buy the...  Yeah, why no chiclets?  I love a good chiclet.  Families pull their kids out of school and make them sell little trinkets and stuff  by the docks.  That's why?  Yeah.  Are the chiclets okay?  I don't know.  I didn't buy it.  What's a chiclet?  Buy them.  Education assistant.  The gum.  The bubble gum.  Oh, the gum.  I thought it was like a chiclet.  Chiclet.  Chiclet.  Chiclet. 
[01:22:00]  That's what they do.  That and try to braid your hair the whole time.  Braids.  Braids.  How many...  No.  How many cruises have you been on where there were mysterious deaths?  None, but there was one where they had to turn around because they think they forgot  people.  But there's been another cruise where they told us where there was a family that missed  the boat.  So it was their responsibility to find a plane or a helicopter to the next port.  Lucy, take the pilot boat!  It's an old I Love Lucy reference. 
[01:22:30]  Thank you.  But I did...  You used to see them throw the garbage off, like in the late 80s.  You'd see them throw it off the back.  Now they just talk about how eco-conscious they are and how green they are and everything.  Yeah.  Sure they are.  Hey, E-Rock, tell them about the BLTs and the Snow Dog.  Oh, yeah.  In your cabin, they have a handful of movies that show around the clock, and every time  I came home, that Snow Dogs with Cuba Gooding Jr. was on.  With who?  I didn't see that.  Cuba Gooding Jr. 
[01:23:00]  It could be one of the worst movies ever.  Oh, Snow...  Is it good?  It's bad?  Oh, it's horrible.  What's his name?  Isn't he Academy...  What's that?  Who was that?  He said it.  No, who?  Gooding.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, I...  Are you sure he was in that?  That's why I'm laughing, because I think you're wrong about him being in that.  I know.  I'm waiting for the party.  Is it?  Yeah, he's not in that.  I think he's in it.  Who?  Cuba Gooding Jr.  What am I saying wrong?  You're not saying anything wrong. 
[01:23:30]  You're putting the wrong person in the wrong movie.  That's a great sound clip.  He wasn't in the movie?  What am I saying wrong?  Now, all right, Snow Dogs.  Yeah.  Which was made when?  Do you know, roughly?  No, I don't.  All right.  I don't remember.  About what?  Are you making some mistake?  What was it about?  It's about a black guy who had Snow Dogs and had to race them in Alaska.  Okay, now who are you saying starred in it?  Cuba Gooding Jr.  All right, I'm with you now.  What am I saying wrong?  Nothing.  It's good.  Nothing.  It's really good.  You're saying everything right, which is why I love you.  Don't you worry about it. 
[01:24:00]  Great.  Do they force you to belly flop the entire time you're on the cruise ship so there's like  a wave pool for everybody else?  There's a wave pool.  I heard it, Sam.  Thanks.  BLT's Chocolate Milk and Snow Dogs with Cuba Gooding.  Yeah, around 3.30 in the morning.  Wow, that's a hell of a vacation.  That's awful.  Amazing.  Did you guys ever take cruises?  What do they do below Florida? 
[01:24:30]  Are you allowed to go to Cuba or do you not?  No, you're not allowed to go there.  They go past it, but you're not allowed.  Are you allowed to go there?  All right, so it's Cuba Gooding Jr.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  I thought he crowned Cuba.  Why would you call him that?  It's C-U-B-A.  I don't know.  I thought that's how he pronounced his name.  You're a bub.  Jesse wants in.  Jesse.  Hey, good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys. 
[01:25:00]  Hello.  Congratulations on Down and Dirty, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, E-Rock, how many people with their hands joined together does it take to get behind you on the conga line?  See, that's a fat joke.  Yeah, that's hurtful.  He was so excited to talk about his cruise experience.  Yeah.  It's all about the gluttony.  Just eating.  It's awesome.  Sleeping.  You ordered chocolate milk?  No.  Oh, well, yeah.  With your BLTs.  Room service chocolate milk and a BLT.  What farts he must have had?  Mayo and a BLT and a bacon?  Oh, please. 
[01:25:30]  Must have thought they ran aground just smelling like seaweed and low tide.  Must be low tide.  What am I smelling?  Oh, BLT and chocolate milk.  And you're a what?  A diamond?  I have diamond status.  That's hilarious.  You're too young to have diamond status.  You're not diamond status.  Apparently, I'm only a few short from diamond plus status.  What's diamond plus status?  What's the difference?  I don't know yet.  I was just looking at it online. 
[01:26:00]  No, it's just upgrades, better rooms, more perks.  Where have you been?  Casino money.  You've not mentioned any exotic location to which you've visited.  Been through the entire Caribbean, South America.  Any country.  Like a locust, he's been through it.  Leaves it barren.  Jeff, in Staten Island, Iraq is right.  He does pronounce his name Cuba.  No.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  It's Cuba Gooding Jr.  No, I'm not sure.  I've heard his father say it.  I knew one jackass.  No, that's the way he says it. 
[01:26:30]  I've heard him say it.  He said it.  He says, all right.  And even if he said it, C-U-B-A is Cuba.  How he says it is irrelevant to what the country is called.  Good question from Mike in Florida.  Mike, you got Iraq.  Mike?  Mike?  Yeah, I know that on these cruises,  there's an open bar,  but does that include all the ice cubes you want  and you drink?  Oh, you rock.  All right.  You'll like it.  Try it. 
[01:27:00]  I want to try it.  I have no one to go with.  Have you been on the ships with the rock wall?  Not yet.  I haven't been on that new one.  Really?  Yeah.  No, you've only been on the older ones?  The older ones.  The new ones with the rock wall and the onboard surfing and the water shows and stuff.  I haven't been on that one yet.  We're booked for 2010 for the brand new one that's being built.  It's the biggest cruise ship ever to be built.  Where?  Yeah.  We're going down to the Caribbean.  Yeah.  Me and my whole family in 2010. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Yeah.  About a week.  Are there any other seats on that one?  Hmm?  Any other seats on that boat?  I mean, seats.  Like, you know, rooms.  Jimmy wants to go.  There's plenty of rooms.  I want to go on a cruise.  Now, you know what they're doing?  They're putting inside balconies.  That overload.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They call it Central Park in this new ship that's coming out.  It's giant.  It's like what the casinos do in Vegas.  So you have a balcony and you can overlook the entire inside of the ship.  Overlook the inside of the ship.  And then there's the balconies outside.  And I like the outside balconies. 
[01:28:00]  Better.  But I want to get that.  I want to get the mother F suite.  The, like, that big one.  Yeah, I can't afford the ones that you get.  Of course you can't.  The ones with pianos and butlers.  I'm paying for the BLTs and chocolate milk.  I'm sure that rings up quite a bill.  How much is a BLT on a cruise ship?  I bet.  Jesus Christ.  It's like $80.  I thought the food was free.  Yeah, the food's free.  They charge your drinks to your room.  All your bar tab goes to your room.  Yeah, it's usually pretty hefty.  How much is sweet on those things? 
[01:28:30]  It could go anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars for, you know, steerage up towards  of $20,000.  20 grand?  Oh, yeah.  But you're talking two floors.  It overlooks the entire front of the boat, this suite.  Wait, is that per person or is that for the whole room?  That's for the whole room.  And that's for the week?  Or two weeks?  Yeah.  Huh.  Not that bad.  But there's three rooms in it.  A piano, a kitchen, a thing.  A hot tub. 
[01:29:00]  You hold parties in there.  You could like, believe me, it's worth it.  Who am I going to go with?  I got to go by myself.  You don't go with anybody.  You just grab errant chicks running around the boat and go, look at my room.  And ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Really?  Oh, please.  Go by yourself.  With that suite?  And then you throw them overboard because no one ever, like, thinks anyone's killed.  They think it's an accident.  Got another question coming in.  Throw that whore right overboard.  Got another question for E-Rock.  For E-Rock, Alan in Virginia.  Alan, good question coming in. 
[01:29:30]  Uh, E-Rock, when you're on your cruise, did you do any scuba diving?  it's just the dumbest things that make us laugh here all right we gotta take a break  is kevin smith here do they have video games i wanted to play kubert  yeah you can at least sit around if you're eating you're done watching tv you could just  put your rubik's cool you're a dope he's very excited though he loves his cruises diamond boy

[01:31:00]  to do that's it it's all oh my god i was like i guess they don't want to be in it they're too good  for my picture that's all it took right you just gotta ask that would be a career highlight to be  in a kevin smith movie even if i just walked in the background i would walk in the background for  you we totally could have done that i'd probably be up in the foreground saying something i would  probably mess that up too just trying to act natural but looking just stupid  five a sham yeah pulling the old yes walking like someone who's power walking you see this  power walk right you're just going in for gum you don't need to power look into the camera like peewee 
[01:31:30]  did and when he's looking at the camera and kind of looks at i guess the director and he almost  gives like a what should i do now look classic genius god how much patience you think he would  have before he goes all right oh look we've tried you walking into the 7-11 25s i would give you i'd  give you 15 takes before i had a private discussion with you pull you away from the cast and crew and  just be like look stay on the radio maybe if you just stand by the hostess things and i would even do 
[01:32:00]  that stupid like walking i got a special job for you stand next to me at the monitor  to the magic of hollywood we'll get you in there somehow don't worry we got the footage but that  would be like taking your kid to work type stuff exactly i would be that guy i'm doing that yeah  go ahead no go see you guys i i kind of tried to write a pilot and uh i pitched it actually and uh  i had you guys as recurring stuff anywhere but as a as a awful radio show like like the type of

[01:34:00]  knows how to how to tell a story comedically he's a cinematic storytelling and and you would think  he's been doing it for years and years but dude's like 25 26 it's it's effortless that's what i'm  getting at effortless just really funny on screen and it just looks like he's he's just going to the  emotions something else to be jealous of and it's almost money for nothing because it's so  effortless for that guy yeah he's a nice guy you know we were talking in the trailer oh yeah seth  walked over we just all had a chat on the set and uh really a nice enough guy yeah big fan of comics 
[01:34:30]  he's very familiar with the world of comics and whatnot so he knew knew a lot of knows a lot of  people i think he's coming in here is he coming in your future yeah so you know how it is a bunch of  bunch of peers on a movie set just chit-chatting about stuff you know how it is  i throw my opinion i'm like kev what about this he's like good point jim absolutely did he really  hot coffee in my face it was called it was just called uh zach and miri and and jimmy said make  it make a porno that's right i said that's genius i said it'll never come back to bite us in the ass  i said yeah yeah catching some flack that will only work for us i know i know jackasses around the 
[01:35:00]  country about that uh the title it is they don't like seeing the word porno in print on the uh bus  shelters because children might see the word and and what read it and then what and then ask a  question everyone's terrified a kid will ask a question like the question to me to be terrified  that a kid would ask you is like why why can't you lose weight why what is what waits for me on the 
[01:35:30]  other side of death dad why are people so horrible you know is there a god those are questions that  i'm like man i don't relish the answer that what's porno i'm just like it's nothing you have to worry  about yeah it doesn't have it doesn't have the cast of high school musical in it yeah it doesn't have  hannah montana it would be in no interest to you but to me it would that's what you tell me just you  tell them look man it's nothing you have to worry about until you're in your 20s and you have no cash 
[01:36:00]  then come back and ask me i'll tell you what it is i'll tell you i'll sit down and watch this i'll  introduce you to the right people this is crazy why are people so terrified of answering a question  of their kid i read something that uh about the the title of the movie and that a father was watching  um the dodger game and uh the commercial came on and they could say they had always watched the  games together and he said to his horror the the child had asked him uh daddy what does porno mean  right and that just set the dad off and by gum he went out and and got some uh things done he 
[01:36:30]  called up and the dodgers organization not bucking william under or a knee-jerk reaction or anything  said uh they pulled the spot uh they don't ever want to see it and the dodgers organization is a  family-oriented blah blah blah how many of the steroid pump players go and take a huge fat meat fist to  their wife's face in front of their kids but never mind that dude how many times you watch a  baseball game or a football game and you see viagra ads oh yeah or erectile dysfunction ads not to be 
[01:37:00]  specific because i guess there are a few how do you explain that to a kid no one questions that  the daddy can take a look at your mom oh yeah this is what happens to daddy he's in bed with mommy  these days when that when that tub you call mother walks in with her apron picture daddy like a flag  on a still day me and jimmy go after jokes like uh going after a fumble oh you were so far ahead on 
[01:37:30]  that one i was in the backfield you were 30 yards away yeah it's it just it's so um it's hypocritical  uh you know the the beer ads too which we have beer ads on this uh station i got nothing against  boner pill ads i got nothing against beer ads but when but don't try to keep the playing field level  for heaven's sake holier than now attitude that well we can't have the word porno uh in a commercial  you know why because there are people that actually are convinced that it's real pornography 
[01:38:00]  and i'm like right when was the last time you ever saw a porno with the word porno in the title  yeah you know what i'm saying it's like it's usually like all anal volume 28 like they don't  put the word porno in the title that would be like renting a movie at a video store that was that  had the word drama in the title or comedy or sci-fi or kids like it kind of ruins it yeah it's just  crazy it's always but it is always they never put porno it's always some weird thing like uh you 
[01:38:30]  know transsexual celebrity lookalikes five yes oh random example there's usually a number  involved yes whereas the four was so good and then five just completely fell off so many  unanswered questions so kevin is this controversy good for you or bad for you um i mean i guess  to some degree it gets the word about the movie out there people more people hear about the title  but i would prefer that it just didn't exist like i would just like to release the movie on its own  merit and like the first time you heard about it is because you saw commercial or somebody was like  i saw this movie and hopefully they say it's funny yeah but not not this like you don't want i i'd 
[01:39:00]  personally don't want to be have this out in front of the movie and that's how people hear  about it it's just the movie doesn't need it like if the movie was weak i'm like yeah man this  controversy oh my god please come support the movie movie strong it's strong it doesn't need like that  kind of help that kind of help from from controversy and the poster really is good with the stick figures  that's that came from like the inability to get a poster approved by the mpaa really yeah yeah 
[01:39:30]  why it's on that monitor somebody scroll down are you kidding see the poster of them side by side  yeah that's how it's that image they didn't want that no the mpa that was the last one just explain  because it's radio what's the problem you got seth rogan side by side with elizabeth banks the two  stars of zach and mary make a porno and they're in their regular clothes overly they're overly  because it's winter in pittsburgh that's where the movie takes place so what was but at the bottom  look at the bottom of that image what was the problem see the heads at the bottom oh wow okay 
[01:40:00]  that's that wow that's really good but still they're but still they're dressed yes like yeah  granted it's a little like it's a little risque they could be standing but the people could be  facing the same way they are absolutely and also like does anyone not remember when there's something  about mary had cameron diaz with a that hair on a poster yeah yeah and if you knew what the movie  was about right you know how come that gets approved that's someone overthinking it man no doubt that's 
[01:40:30]  the combination of that image and the word porn we deal with that crap on our radio show it's like  stop overthinking this yeah it's uh people that just uh put that up on onaradio.com so people can see  i don't know what their agenda is when it comes to things like that like oh it's protecting kids  dude it's always protecting the children you know i don't even know if it's the kids so much anymore  it's like some people just found that term highly objectionable which i you know i i get look if 
[01:41:00]  you're against pornography in general it's a little weird but whatever you know i get it that i can  understand against a word it's the word yeah yeah it describes the genre dude it's it's like being  against the word action yeah yeah it did you did you see this coming at all like like when you first  when i titled the flick the the the worst i thought it would ever get is that based on that title some  people are not gonna go but i always assumed that those people that weren't going we're never going 
[01:41:30]  no matter what we call we call a room with a view they're not gonna go yeah so that was it i never  thought it would come down to this because i'm like ah it's porno a word if you can have sex in the  city you know all over posters this summer why why not that the word sex hey daddy what does sex  exactly oh well yeah why didn't that catch any uh can i tell you we're a nation of of spoiled babies  who are used to whining and having mommy and daddy do what we say that's what no one can just go hey 
[01:42:00]  i don't like that but it's going to exist whether i like it or not i like the point kevin may though  that there's nothing wrong with kids asking questions about some of this stuff man i can answer a  question for my kid right yeah i should be as a responsible parent if i'm responsible enough to  make that kid appear i should be responsible enough to answer a question whatever question  a dopey kid can come up with absolutely an adult should be able to answer that question it is no  more complex than answering the question to her mother like why was that so short why is it so 
[01:42:30]  little why you know i can answer those questions i can certainly tell my kid what point i was  and kevin as a parent i mean it does more damage to make a lot of this stuff taboo obviously  to like oh well we can't talk about that son in my house we believe in in candor it's not like we  scream the most uh vulgar obscenities in the kid's face but we don't i don't personally i can't speak  for the wife i don't govern my language around the kid so i you know if i'm using the f word as a  modifier or as an adjective and the kids in the room i don't i don't suddenly stop stare at her and 
[01:43:00]  then turn around and edit myself because it would just be hypocritical that's how i make my living  like i'm not i'm not gonna tell the kid don't curse it's like cursing puts clothes on your back  food on your table roof over your head so in my house we're just rather free with the discussion  you know there's some things you don't say in front of a kid like i'm gonna take your mother  at night i'm gonna flip her over you know whatever i don't get into the details with her but you know  she knows sometimes we're like harley you gotta go downstairs and play in your room and the door 
[01:43:30]  gets locked and she knows something's up she's not sure what it is but why why lie to the kid  sure yeah scram and so that's the way it is in my house i understand it's not the way it is in  everybody's house but i don't know i just find that it's had a great effect on the kid and as much as  the kid won't curse even if i take her on stage with me like introducing something and i'm like  say f into the mic she won't do it and i've never gotten a call from the school where they're like  you know your kid has been using some terminology i was wearing a shirt the other day 
[01:44:00]  like two weeks ago i was supposed to go up to a q a gig in um edmonton and i got to the airport  and they booted me from the flight and so really yeah it was crazy dude and i was there on time too  this had nothing to do with oh they overbooked the they just over i thought it was about the  yeah that poster really offends me no it was i they overbooked the flight so i i go home and  to stop people from going to the venue you know i put up a blog and in the blog i'm like this is what  happened and i at one point i say f air canada so i wind up going to the ebb and two gig a week later 
[01:44:30]  somebody made me a shirt said f air canada on it but it doesn't say f and i would just say it but  we're on terrestrial right now right so i'm wearing that shirt around the house because somebody bought  it nice and big you know it wasn't like what sometimes you get an xl shirt i'm like i've worn  this since i was 10 you got to come correct with the size so i'm wearing that shirt around the house  and my kid sees it my kid just goes to my wife well dad's wearing an outrageous shirt today  you know so an outrageous yeah totally i was like dad's cuckoo yeah so dad's being very risky 
[01:45:00]  so i don't know for me that's maybe it's just my house but i just don't feel like it's a big issue  with kids i like how you do it i just don't like she's not interested yeah i tell her immediately like  porno is a grown-up movie and she's like i don't care people the fact that that you know you're in  your house or you're you're raising your child you have your family the way you want to have it  uh and other people are like no i think i know better i know better for your kids and what they 
[01:45:30]  should or shouldn't see and i don't believe you can make the decision what your child should see so  i'm gonna just uh complain and bitch until there's some legislation made to eliminate this completely  that was for the children that was the first hurdle on the movie like the first and what i assumed  would be the only hurdles initially they gave us an nc-17 for the movie so i went and tried to work  with the mpa make some trims and they kept kicking it back kicking it back there's a shot we'll call  it an egregious bodily fluid shot very funny it's that when they were like that'll never play in an 
[01:46:00]  r-rated movie and they also cited like uh too much thrusting in the first porno sequence of the movie  the fake porno sequence so we tried to work with them and then i got to a point where i was like i'm  not comfortable making any more trim so i'd rather take it to the appeals process so we appealed it  that's where you take it you accept the rating and then you take it out of the mpa ratings board  hands and then you show it to a bunch of new people an audience made up of other members of the mpa half  that audience and then the other half of the audience are members of nato the national association 
[01:46:30]  of theater owners and you get it like you know what the hell do they have to do the joint chiefs of  staff were there we were a lot of trouble of defense from england treaty or yeah no kidding  national association of theater owners the old warsaw pact comes in  um so you show it to them and then you argue it argue your side of the case you get 15 minutes get  up and talk about why you feel it should be an r-rated movie uh the other side joan graves who heads 
[01:47:00]  up the ratings board she gets 15 minutes talk about why they rated nc-17 why they want to pull  the rating get 10 minutes to rebut she gets 10 minutes to rebut which sounds a little dirty in  this case of this movie but we all know rebuttal word then you leave the room and they make a vote  you know a silent vote and then decide whether to flip it or not so they flipped it we flipped the  rating without having to make any cuts because i put all the stuff in the movie i wanted there  so after that i was just like okay we're off and running the mpa has now finally signed off on this  title of this movie it wasn't so much the title there she was more of the content so i was like 
[01:47:30]  this is that was as hard as it'll ever get and then this stuff started what's her name the woman  joan graves she's like an old lady she's like my mom she's actually very nice like you know there's  no like adversary relationship with the woman she's cool like she stood up and she was like look  nobody's saying the movie's not funny nobody's saying it's not sweet we're just saying that like  no 17 year old should get into this movie kev i i saw the movie you got away with some good stuff we  did actually you should be you should be pretty proud yeah i'm very happy i want to yell and scream 
[01:48:00]  for you but uh i was sitting there going oh right on man yeah let's just be right on it must just be  like oh hi kevin hey how you doing i asked her at one point i was just like how many of these you  got today appeal screening she's like we do maybe maybe 10 of these a year she's like and you seem  to be involved with a lot of them that was the third time that i did that that i actually kind of  went and flipped the rating was there one dumb thing they they took out that frustrated you they  didn't that's the point i got everything in there everything like you said okay so why only 10 a  year why don't more people fight it what's the worst that can happen that's what i say i'm like 
[01:48:30]  at the very least you lose and you're back to square one and apparently the odds of flipping it  i think it's only like four percent of the movies actually try it and only one percent of the movies  actually ever change the rating and i think i make up that one percent because i've done it three  times well you're probably an articulate uh arguer and you have a good point of uh like hey what's  wrong with uh answer to question like you have a great way of basic simple logical my opening to  them was just like look you don't make a movie called zach and miriam make a porno without 
[01:49:00]  expecting to come into extra close scrutiny when it came time to rate the movie so we went out of  our way to make sure that we fit within the safe confines of an r albeit a hard r-rated movie  you're allowed to cite precedent at this point but i told them i i said look if this movie came out  when i was 13 years old in 1983 when i first got cable in my house would have sent me to the  bathroom to tug one out yes absolutely i said but we live in 2008 where you could just open up your 
[01:49:30]  laptop and you can watch real people having real sex for 15 seconds at a time if you don't pay the  membership fee that's right or you can line up 10 different images it's 10 different 15 second  seamlets and watch those or if you film me and double it i said this is not this is not going  to be titillating to a kid at all they're just going to find it funny you do get creative with  the samples on those sites you really get creative it's crazy let's not talk about the controversy  well uh kevin we're going to take a break but uh we really haven't explained the movie yet yeah yeah 
[01:50:00]  we should do that in your words what what is uh the movie about uh i'm that title don't say at all  what do you think pretty much yeah zach and mary do make a porno yeah there's a couple down on their  luck in pittsburgh and they figure out look we make a porno we can start paying some bills around  here the shocking thing about the movie how sweet it is i it's it's it's very touching it isn't it i  mean it's touching dare i say it turns into almost a romantic comedy how do you how do you do that i  don't know that's that's your wrong that's your talent of filth in it that's your talent because it's  uh yeah it's almost like it's almost like a date movie buddy that's i know that's what i was telling 
[01:50:30]  harvey weinstein i was like this is a date movie he's like you're crazy i said i don't know dude  maybe it's my kind of date but yeah i think guys and girls together would totally dig this movie  yeah is there gonna be a sequel no oh jimmy have my hopes up and to come back and jimmy's in it to  see him on the screen made me like smile totally i know i got to the camera you know you say a date  movie and stuff and then just pop right in my head i got a handy uh during friday the 13th did you 
[01:51:00]  yeah i got the the next level up at labyrinth really yeah wow nice in long grass this theater  that's now closed i think that was the only like sexual experience i had yeah i never really had  i'd already seen labyrinth once before that was the only reason i could go in for it because i was  like i don't want to miss anything yeah this is a jim henson movie i don't want to miss any david bowie  i was teabagged to the shining hey with that we got kevin smith in studio we're gonna take a quick 
[01:51:30]  break he's with us for the rest of the morning so uh we'll continue opian anthony we're hanging  with kevin smith today on the opian anthony show the new movie zach and mira make a porno in theaters  uh week from friday right halloween night comes out a week from friday halloween is halloween a big  what are you guys doing we're doing a little party unless you got something for us to do and then  we'll blow off our listeners to the party in a second what you got for us anything on halloween  except for the kid to get out trick-or-treating but they're going like uh hey halloween probably 
[01:52:00]  be a weekday for the movie because people party i was like is that true people really party on  halloween i think more so now yeah yeah people are like going out a lot of it don't party yeah  because they i don't know you don't see kids running around for halloween anymore they're usually  out with their parents until the sun goes down they'll run home that's us dudes of all the  maniacs dark and then we leave and and you don't go anywhere you want there's very  distinct houses with like bag the neighborhood watch group yeah flags houses they put like uh 
[01:52:30]  bags with candles in them and those are the only house those are the only ones you go to it's so  i hate to sound like this too it's like in my day i know you know it just sound like an old  bastard complaining that it sucks now but uh trick-or-treating till 10 o'clock at night  yeah and and just run around you're filling a pillowcase yeah going home dropping off going  back out and then going to a different area of town oh yeah yeah you walk around you didn't know  where you were or go to the same house it's just you know different mask yeah mess with your costume  just a little bit that was like committing a crime when you're a kid you're like i hope they 
[01:53:00]  don't notice i'll say they'll pick out the fat kid they'll be like you were here before  yes and i was like well no me no someone looked like me you were jupiter before now you're  saturn we know it killed so you just found the house that had the big snickers bars it was all  over you hit that house five or six times oh yeah and you make a good point because i live in a  building we have to sign up yeah are you going to be one of the apartments for uh trick-or-treating  and then these bastards they they take over the elevators for the day so you can't get anywhere you 
[01:53:30]  have to sit in your apartment all day wow you're right they know the parents hold the elevator door  floor after you can't leave your apartment you gotta decide all right if i got stuff to do i gotta do it  in the morning because i ain't leaving oh how long can the stairs be well i'm i'm kind of yeah  about 500 feet up cloud city i'm in cloud city yeah you can tell the different financial status  he needs a pod car to pick him up a little ugnaught holding an elevator broken up c3po in his hallway  joins lando calrissian for dinner well what have we here jumps out his window and hangs on the 
[01:54:00]  and 10 of the millennium nice oh christ so uh yeah it is a kind of year i don't sign up though  it's kind of nice to not have them knocking on my door my girl signed up so now really  well you don't even put out like i believe and if i'm not going to answer the door i just put out  the bucket of candy i'm like first one here gets everything yeah you know you put them on their  honor but the honor system doesn't work kids and candy not at all i uh i i was in glenn cove living 
[01:54:30]  there and um uh predominantly i like living in predominantly jewish neighborhoods i'm the only  catholic there but um i just like the jewish people are very quiet people and i kind of like  that right you know no shenanigans going on in my neighborhoods do they celebrate halloween uh yeah  yeah there's a lot of boo little scary ghostly things and stuff but uh christmas is completely  different like my house is lit up like crazy and they just got one menorah in their windows and  they're like oh the goddamn catholics at it again and then you hear booze but it's coming out of 
[01:55:00]  the other houses yes i swear i'm putting a manger on my lawn screw them all uh yeah so uh one halloween  in in um i was when i was living in glenn cove uh or a great neck uh i i got this candy and i didn't  know i bought a bunch of candy had in a big tray and everything i'm like this is the first time i'm  actually in a house i'm not in an apartment i go there's probably gonna be kids coming up i'll get  them candy it's like my first experience with actually giving it out um so uh i didn't know 
[01:55:30]  that they actually take inner city children and bring them to these neighborhoods these kind of  upper crusty neighborhoods and just let them out to get candy so the first ding dong i hear i'm  expecting to see all my little uh jewish neighbors and stuff come to the door a few indian neighbors that  i have and it was a bunch of like um like real homies that were a little too old to be trick-or-treating  and stuff and they're like yo trick-or-treat and i was like okay so i kind of put the tray out 
[01:56:00]  one kid took his forearm and like bam in half and swiped it into his bag and like walked away like he had  a jewelry store it only gets better if he's like do something and pretends to hit you hold the fist  up and you're just like it's cool yeah no it's cool take it take the candy that's what it was he just  swiped half of it right into my bag i can get behind it though man i remember leaving my neighborhood and 
[01:56:30]  going to the uptown neighborhood oh really he was better yeah and i'm i am not a an inner city homie  but still i was just like let's go where the candy's better and i can tell you're not from that  neighborhood as well i would i would do that as a kid too you know when you got the the big size  hershey bars and still those little econo pack crappy things the ones that you would actually pay  like 50 cents for the counter the ones you bought like year round yeah you know you got that kind of  stuff for halloween not the halloween little ones no uh it was it was great yeah but but i sure as hell 
[01:57:00]  wasn't gonna swipe half of it from someone's tray he was getting his man he certainly had more more  balls than you as a kid i know this is hacky but we could do it really quick just because we brought  it up there's a list that came out today actually the 10 uh most disappointing trick-or-treats for the  treaters uh toothbrushes remember when they used to like that was actually a oh you never got a  toothbrush when you're trick-or-treating i didn't that came after i stopped trick-or-treating i didn't have 
[01:57:30]  a dentist in the neighborhood so that never happened i would tell him to keep the toothbrush to scrape  the eggs out of your shingles tomorrow you ask give me candy the most disappointing treats uh really  fast raisins yeah everyone's why the little thing of raisins the candy corn they just give you a  handful and throw it in your bag that was garbage at the bottom of your bag and they were touching it  yeah it was in their hands like boss's teeth smarties and necco wafers i so agree with that 
[01:58:00]  i used to play communion with them fun to do they're way too thick odd communion wafer dude way  too thick and flavorful the dumb dumb lollipops yes the tiny little ones apples tootsie rolls  tootsie rolls candy apples were the worst how you toting that around all day and again i don't like  homemade stuff i'm like look she made cookies first of all it's not going to hold up in the bag secondly  you made them yeah you touched it like that the miscellaneous wrapped hard candies you know like 
[01:58:30]  it has a picture of a shower balls and whatnot then you got laffy laffy taffy or laffy see that  never worked laffy taffy doesn't work a laffy taffy sounds silly laffy taffy it's a word that  doesn't rhyme maybe if you're in pittsburgh though huh bring it back to the movie laffy taffy  laffy someone gives me a laffy taffy i'm like don't condescend to me how dare you  there's nothing laffy about this and then finally because they got to make the list cute  anything fun sized i i think apples tops that list and that was like to illustrate the difference 
[01:59:00]  between how protective you have to be for halloween now in terms of allowing your kids to eat candy  yeah the difference between now and then is like apples were the only thing that you ever had to  worry about on halloween you don't have to worry about being abducted no you didn't have to worry  about anything it was just like if you get an apple whip it down the street make sure there's  no razor got the razor it's got the razor that was the most terrifying thing about halloween is like  possibly encountering an apple with a razor but how are they gonna hide the razor in the apple you 
[01:59:30]  wouldn't know no man the idea was like razors are really thin they slip it in on an angle where you  wouldn't even think it turn brown or anything they do it fresh right the skin would be broken and  you got that you got that yeah but as a kid you don't care you're not looking you got that thought  of just the razor going between your front yeah remember they did it and there's a little scene  in halloween too where the mother's taking a kid to the emergency room and she got the razor in her  oh it's horrible i remember seeing that and i was like oh never me please never me i actually just 
[02:00:00]  leave a bunch of razors in a ball outside my kitchen i'm like shave or eat them it's up to you  yeah it was that was just you didn't worry about being abducted as a kid you know you went to  the creepiest damn houses the creep guy you never freaking saw it at any other time of the year and  he's like okay i'll knock on his door and i was talking about the other day about people that would  go all out make that stupid haunted house that would go from their front door to their back door  yeah and it's actually where you're like i don't want to go in your house can i just have can we just 
[02:00:30]  move this along handy but now you would never get away with that it's like yeah i want the kids  coming into my house nope sorry i'm a man who lives alone yeah i'm into my house yeah and i had  plenty of time to do this i put a lot of thought into this happy halloween creep can we look at my  gladiator costume high roman boots no underpants let me show you my war helmet let's go to ricky  in connecticut ricky we're hanging with kevin smith today hey uh first of all big fan kevin love your 
[02:01:00]  movies uh i got the uh story about the worst trick-or-treat i ever got there was uh a house  with the local asians and every trick-or-treat without fail we would get either soy sauce or  duck sauce or both in our trick-or-treat bag yuck what just a little package that's kind of funny  or they just squirt it into the bag eat this you capitalist pigs  all right thanks ricky he started his phone call by saying he's a big fan by the way 
[02:01:30]  all right putting your head i was putting the headphones on thank you sir thank you very much  ah let's see ah yeah we kind of did this one but tom in jersey tom hey what's up guys  oh tom in jersey tom well probably a ghost you're slow to the room because i hear boo  all right time's up tom sorry hey zach and mirra make a porno so you got to work with tracy lords 
[02:02:00]  i did for the for the older listeners man that's i i saw her in your film i'm like that's tracy lords  and the other people uh at this particular screening i don't think they recognized no i i think that's an  age differentiation thing for some cats um we were at one point we decided to make the character  bubbles she plays character name bubbles uh a cougar and uh because we figure like all right  she's been just hanging around the pittsburgh bachelor party scene for years and years and years  so we were trying to think like who did we find insanely sexy when we were 10 11 12 13 years old 
[02:02:30]  and we thought like kelly lebrock from weird science that then we saw some pictures that  didn't pan out no tracy lords though looks phenomenal and we thought about her but then  we're like she has not had anything to do with anything related to porno with the word porno near  it in 20 years and whatnot so it was a long shot we asked her agent and he's like he's got porn on  the script she ain't gonna read then she heard that rogan was in it so she came over the house to read 
[02:03:00]  the script and then i sat around talking to her for three hours and her issues are very rare she's  like look it's funny and i would love to be in it but like i have had nothing to do i put my i kept  that life at arm's length at this point for the last 20 years she's like i've made porno in 20 years  and still when my name comes up people immediately associate it with porn she's like so i don't know  maybe i can embrace it and just make fun of it maybe it's time to just kind of stop running from  it embrace it make fun of it i was like please do it and do it in this movie and the weirdest thing  was like i she literally sat in my living room at the bar with me for three hours chit-chatting 
[02:03:30]  and the whole time get some i'm just i was gonna say the same thing we're all guys totally that's  what i like i just i was wishing that i could get in the time machine go back in time tell the 16 year  old version of me like one day tracy lloyd's gonna be in your house and your parents are not gonna be  home yeah and then like i'm sure the 16 year old version of me would be like where did you get a  time machine well if you wasted on take this with you the sports it's the sports great sports

[02:06:00]  opposed to like now biff you need money and i want to humiliate you for what you did to my lorraine  yes so we're gonna we're gonna anally render you absolutely useless with a series of injections and  shots in my garage and that will make that'll kind of make up for you almost date raping lorraine  not like letting him wash the car and he's like oh i'm sorry boss i'm sorry sorry hey your book's  here your book's here it's like all right you're the guy that tried to rape my wife it's like it is 
[02:06:30]  an uncomfortably creepy relationship to keep that dude around man they uh they really like it and  that's an odd thing about comedies back then like that was it was spielberg it was a huge robert  big budget movie yeah zemeckis directing and like they get one scene where it's like a beat it spook  yeah you know like the language in it and some of the undertones that that were going on in it are  like wow you know it's pretty tough for uh yeah for a comedy with michael j fox in it totally  you're like 14 15 going is that okay to say yeah what try that in the real world 
[02:07:00]  and you know the whole rape thing and that is crazy i never i never really thought about the  rape angle of it but it is pretty heinous man that that dude is like in the future he should be in jail  right in the alternate future that dude should just be in jail and then cuckled relationship  i'll bet you biff his whole job is to prep the bull that's his punishment  like marty's dad goes out to do the press tour for his new sci-fi book and biff comes in and 
[02:07:30]  he's like it should have been you biff why did i marry that geeky loser there's a picture there's  bionic biff getting arrested by future nazi police or something they look like ss  what is that has like a flower pot on his head yeah i don't know what it is is that a helmet  you can actually buy it's an egg you can buy that helmet it's an egg crate or something i remember  when they started selling the jacket and the shoes yeah and i'm like okay i guess i would never wear it 
[02:08:00]  but i kind of get it but who would wear biff's helmet uh danny yes somebody uh somebody yesterday  just yesterday sent me a link to uh marty's future jacket that he wears in 2015 that's some  it was a replica that some chinese company makes you could own it for 400 dollars wow oh boy there  have been people that have been lobbying was it reebok at the time nike his nike his futuristic  nikes they've been lobbying them to make those make them available yeah they had the big fly 2015s  that's incredible they actually made them and uh and it's not even like that doesn't commemorate 
[02:08:30]  back to the future no that commemorates back to the future too yeah it's not even the one that  everybody loves it's the middle one where people are like well we'll forgive it a lot i uh i love  the fact that the um the future from back to the future is six years away so they got to come up with  flying cars a lot of stuff that 3d uh jaws yes what was it what number was it it was like 30  jaws 30 has to come out uh they got to make all those jaws and we're gonna fall a bit short i think 
[02:09:00]  we're gonna fall short as far back to the future's future with hoverboards hoverboards everything and they  don't work on water why danny because you need power  did you just audition for kevin smith i think he auditioned for you kevin that is such an obscure  wonderful reference man well done you have no idea that was so awesome we don't stop you have no  idea if you love out our show it'll be called zach and mary killer reference  for everybody coming down to our halloween party there might be a little surprise 
[02:09:30]  yes involving my costume get out of here really look forward to it because i am that's for sure  kevin is enjoying this but let's we'll check in another hour and a half when they continue  kevin's just i'm in there i could do i don't know if you ever listen to this podcast we talk about  we'll kill a subject as well but this is one i could totally get behind i just wish i'd watch  do an entire show yes just based on back to the future if i had enough time if i had enough time  to watch all three the night before yeah we could easily kill did we did it we did it well we did 
[02:10:00]  a future show where we actually watched the movie on the air and did a show we did that might be a  little much about the movie on the air it was a saturday night show no one listens anyway all right  and uh you know just throwing in our own stuff pausing it yeah screwing around but it was like  we're just i don't know why we're captivated with that effing movie the uh the brother and sister  from the first one who don't wind up in two or three really yeah way that and the family that 
[02:10:30]  mattered so much that just doesn't exist anymore yeah gone and in the alternate future his sister  is still heavyset yeah wouldn't they have told her perhaps or they had enough money to like do  something and jimmy olsen around her stomach yes jimmy olsen's a businessman when the hell did this  happen gets all upset he's got to go to the office i have to agree with darren and jersey i gotta get  him on the air darren go ahead i'm right there with you hey guys listen a few minutes ago you're 
[02:11:00]  talking about super hot tracy lords i'm enjoying the conversation thinking about a girl i used to  scrap two years ago and now we're talking about michael jay fox and back to the future we were so  close we were so close to hearing about tracy lords uh ass and then we're doing back to the future  stuff when the hell did this happen i'm with you darren i'm like what happened to tracy lords  we were i'm like i want to hear what happened with tracy lords did you get in here what now you guys  are talking about back this year i would like to know what my copy of the gray sports almanac i have 
[02:11:30]  uh one thing just i have one thing to say to that to get us back on show all right you built a time  machine out of a delorean we're done we're done darren sorry i can't believe you whipped out the  grays almanac i gotta thank my buddy here who is brian rickers sending something i finally will take  home what uh what'd she wear when she came over she just dressed does she dress sexy she doesn't  she's she's so not i mean look she's a gorgeous woman and like most gorgeous women she just kind of 
[02:12:00]  emanate sex but she doesn't throw off a sexual vibe at all and in terms of like actresses i've  worked with or actors in general she takes it all so serious i felt so bad she took it so seriously  and i'm like the character's name bubbles you know it's like i wish i had a better part for you in this  flick because she's method man she trained like after she got out of adult film she devoted her life  to learning how to act and singing i guess she sings as well so she's um total pro absolute pro and 
[02:12:30]  unfortunately she was stuck in a very silly movie you know i want to put her in the next look i  want to put her in red state she could give her something more to do yeah what's going on with  that movie trying to find money for it are you still yeah it's harsh economic times i don't know  if you guys know she's taking better care of certain radio friends like perhaps uh tracy lords  walks in and needs a chair and there's nothing available uh oh i get i catch you jimmy  get it we had we had her on our show yeah and we were we were warned don't talk about the porn  thing with her she's legit she's she was at the junket last weekend and i never got to ask her 
[02:13:00]  or anybody else um how it was for her because you know she was like when she first came over the house  to watch the movie one of the things we talked about was her going out to publicize it and she  was just like i gotta get ready for all the questions again she's like hearing all the same  questions yeah but it's so weird it's like she hasn't done it in 20 years man i'll tell you the  problem she was here's what happened to her she was the queen yeah she was good dude she was  wow she was a prodigy yeah to the throne yeah destined to be the biggest ever and then all of 
[02:13:30]  a sudden it popped out that she was 15 or 16 and that whole thing of ending her career early and  realizing oh my god like that's what why if she had just if she had been 18 and got through she'd be  like seika or any of the other legendary porn actresses that you remember but she was like what's  the word when you become a legend legend if there's a word to become a legend  legendary no but she's not becoming a legend legend is not a word but because of the legendization  iconic iconic but i would say that she i would argue that she's definitely iconic like in terms 
[02:14:00]  of people i've met in my life yeah her stanley johnny rotten are the only like three pop culture  icons that i've ever been in the same room with where you're like your name will live for a long  time after my name is long forgotten like you are a very legendary iconic figure i think that's why too  because she got it just got cut short and i just explained what was so obvious like i had an  inside point but guys she got in trouble early oh really don't remember that jim do tell hey uh one 
[02:14:30]  other thing about the movie jason muse will he do anything for you uh it took a lot of convincing to  get him to show it he's like full frontal wow just packing god damn let me tell you something dude  i've seen that guys we're still on terrestrial yeah i've seen that dude's junk i hate saying junk i've  seen it's so like i can't wait to get to the next studio i've seen that dude's junk more times than  i've seen my own in life because he's one of those dudes that just likes to take it out kind of like  to make you laugh like you'll be sitting next to him he's like is it cold in here and you're like 
[02:15:00]  what are you talking about and he's pants you know and you're like oh put it away dude so i've seen it  i've seen it a bunch and it's not it was never that impressive he comes out of the room during  that scene like he comes i'm sitting behind the monitor watching the door opens he comes out  and i'm like he's wearing mark walberg's um prosthetic from boogie nights there's that is not  muse that is so not muse guarantee here's what he did he looked like crazy not only fluffed yeah  you take a syalus the day before no way uh that takes too much forethought that dude doesn't have 
[02:15:30]  okay really yeah that dude is seriously just like basically affleck called it affleck watched the  movie over the house like two months ago and he wasn't there he wasn't involved he didn't get to  denver read the script so he came in fresh third thing he said about the movie he's like you know  muse is one pump away from total liftoff and i was like you saw that too he's gone his stuff is not  that big i was like right it's usually very small and i told muse that and he's like you tell 
[02:16:00]  affleck for me that that's not me on the way up that's me on the way down and i was like wow man  wow that's a it's such a fine line uh when you're trying to be impressive yes between being impressive  and going all right you see what's going on basically you want to be engorged yes but you  can't in a movie like you can't show an erection in an r-rated film you're instantly nc-17 yeah of  course so that was the one area of the flick like they really should have focused on that when they 
[02:16:30]  were going after the nc-17 because they're like clinically like get a doctor in there and be like  clinically that would constitute an erection uh-huh but they didn't i got uh remember that story we  tell in boston all the time when those girls came out of a bachelor party uh and um me and opa leaving  a gig that was like it was a whole line of bars that were just connected to each other so we're leaving  a gig at another bar and all these chicks are coming out from this bachelorette party and uh they're  all sexed up you know god knows what goes on and those friggin things so uh they they were asking 
[02:17:00]  us to uh show us uh you know show them our our genitals um so i had a few in me you know a few  drinks i was like yeah okay i go but i want to see yours you know this is you know quid pro quo  so uh i was i was kind of psyched at the thought of of just seeing some nudity and everything so it  started working and i knew it was going to be pretty impressive so we went back behind this turgid  if you will yes exactly we we went behind this van could you tag me i needed to be tagged oh what 
[02:17:30]  happened no because he goes behind the van and i'm in the front of the van and all i hear is oh  wow yeah it was pretty good really yeah yeah they wanted to yeah yeah you know how it is i'm like no  i don't and then one of the girls didn't even just want to look anymore get out you want to interact  with it so i i i yeah play video games or make it disappear uh no no just uh play video games okay  fair enough fair enough yeah an old atari yeah uh game controller she wanted to she wanted to play um 
[02:18:00]  combat yes yes combat missile command yeah so um and then yeah i got to see her she was really fat  she was a slob but her friend in the van was hot and that's the one i was gunning for that i just  wanted to see her just staring at the other chick in the van while it was going on yeah and i walked  up to the van door look away look yeah that you see did you watch mad men no there's a it's a really  good show there's an episode uh this week where one of the female characters has a fiancee and he 
[02:18:30]  comes on to her in the office and essentially date rapes her it's pretty horrible but she does  they do that moment where she just kind of looks away and they focus on something in the room like  distant whatnot that's what it sounded like you went through yeah i did it was kind of like i don't i  hate to compare your experience to date rape it was i felt like that i had to shower well i remember  the one girl like did something and everything just fell yes she lifted it was her turn to show  and it was just like this everything just fell like she's wearing those fake wrestling suits she 
[02:19:00]  had something going on because she was the bride too believe it or not yeah and she had it all like  put together nice and to to do her end of the bargain she had to do something and just everything  just but a friend in the van i walked up to the door and it was hot door and uh she saw and  wanted to interact and she was hot so she showed me everything yeah in the back of the van and stuff  and uh what's everything uh you know downstairs upstairs whatever the hell i wanted to see  look at the back yeah yeah to do a twirl how close do you look at the back um not not as close as i 
[02:19:30]  would have liked to believe me she's all right you want to look so close that you can actually peek  through the front like at the keyhole she was all right but she was probably like a five because  the rest of them were like twos and i was you know pretty pretty pretty married buzzing at that  but yeah i was also married at that moment which uh i would like to hear her version of that story  yeah the flip side right hear the flip side of that one kevin our best story we gotta go but um  you gotta tell them the skinny dipping story where we were decided to be good guys what a waste 
[02:20:00]  we were both in a divorce and you think of all the girls you could have had sex with during the  marriage because the marriage means nothing after the divorce right i wasted that that one would  have been great i could have done this we were doing a bar gig and we were like the shock jocks  in boston and we had these young things they were kaluha girls kaluha girls in their tight outfits and  and they asked us to go skinny that thing we're like no no no we can't do that we have to go home  i started i started making out with the one with braces behind there was a kaluha girl she was 18 she 
[02:20:30]  got braces yeah and uh yeah on her legs yeah polio sad story  she's laying there asking for help she's trying to run away i just laughed at her twisted white  shoes then she turned her head and looked at something far away  it'll be over soon then they're like what are you guys doing yeah what are you doing  there's a little pond you want to go skinny dipping we'll go skinny who says no to skinny dipping 
[02:21:00]  i would i would in an absolute heartbeat i would just assume that they were going to take pictures  make fun of my fatness they just wanted to get my clothes off so they could videotape it put it up  on youtube and be like look at this so one could take him out of the bushes and leave you naked  walking home you should never say no to skinny dipping i i'm the other way i always say no to  skinny dipping we're good guys even my wife said let's go skinny dipping i'm like i'm gonna wear  a shirt in the pool i don't trust you fully yet is it amazing when you're with a girl like even a 
[02:21:30]  girl you're dating in your case married you still become ashamed body i have such body shame it's  insane when we get over there i'll tell you guys some horrible stories but oh my god i have such  body shame issues it's crazy man i just don't believe anybody too like the wife's like i don't  care i'm like i look you have to you have to care because if you were this fat i would divorce you  heartbeat like there's no way you can be honest about that how awful is it when you feel their  hand on your body and they happen to mush yes like like for me the side fat when they mush that 
[02:22:00]  and internally i'm going uh it's like how could you not be getting turned off really feeling this  she uh touched my gut last night accidentally and i i nearly started crying i was just like oh the  shame i feel such shame meanwhile my friend malcolm ingram i don't know if you ever met him he was  probably on the set when you're shooting but he's a big dude like me but he's gay and he's a bear  so he gets like insane action from really thin good-looking dudes little cubs oh my god all the  cubs and like these dudes who could like make out like crazy like get totally yes kevin hello i need 
[02:22:30]  some phone numbers from you before you leave they don't even sound like that dude they should like  these dudes are like they they could totally be scoring really really insanely hot chicks these are  the guys that you were terrified of in high school like oh they get all the chicks these are the ones  that malcolm tags and malcolm looks like me and he was talking the other night about like you don't  understand dude it's the one place in the world where being like morbidly obese works for you 
[02:23:00]  because you get to like flaunt it he's like they want to be with you because of the fat he's like so body  shame issues go out the window he's going i have dudes what how do you say it on radio uh making it  disappear yeah okay yes and i'm rubbing my gut on them so they're below the gut he's like i flop my  gut on them like you feel that fat you feel that chub you want it don't know oh yeah  and i was just like what what a heavenly world that must be man where the gut actually works for you 
[02:23:30]  where you're not like i'm gonna be on the bottom because i can't let my gut flop across  your your very tight toned stomach if i'm a man astride i have to be ridden like a horse  it's crazy man crazy you should just go gay and all your i should i should go bear man i'd get an  insane tail and they would like the gut what a what a headline on tmz i'm a bear the headline would be  we knew it i did read that you want to like disappear for a while i do let's talk about there 
[02:24:00]  all right long all right yeah that's something to come that's a good tease i like that look at  that picture on look at that dude yeah is that supposedly a bear i don't let me tell you man  that ain't no bear now he's all he's skinny and yeah he's too thin guys all bag  all right kevin smith the new movie i people are saying i'm pronouncing her name wrong  go see it it's very very funny very very romantic it's a total date movie but but 
[02:24:30]  it's very very funny seth rogan lizard thanks look at that dude that's not a bear either to me  no that's got they go bigger than that yeah no doubt tracy lords tracy lords i saw the movie  katie morgan i saw the movie it's really good stump brain saw we had a really good time thank you  and that's told by a lot of people that i somehow steal the movie so i i think that what jimmy doesn't  have as much time as he had in spider-man but it's it's it's valuable time you do you go even if  you like you aren't going to see the movie you go and you watch my scene and you stand up and 
[02:25:00]  clap and then you walk out in protest as long as they pay dude i don't absolutely you know money  back it's totally worth leaving the house where it's a funny i'm proud of it and rogan kills it  he's hysterical yeah he's really funny man all right uh quick break we'll continue with kevin smith  opie and anthony are you ready  yeah  the headphone volume is oh whatever something every day whatever you hear that right it's low 
[02:25:30]  it's i have to crank the headphones up yeah i noticed that if this kicks in we're all going  to go deaf so i just want to warn everybody ahead of time i got the headphone volume like pinned  and if uh they adjust something somewhere else we will lose our eardrums uh we continue the show  with kevin smith here yes okay that's good morning everybody good morning kevin smith kevin had a story 
[02:26:00]  that i definitely want to hear uh you said you had a kennel thing yeah it was strange it's it's not a  it's not a great story but it is kind of like inside baseball a little bit um i guess uh we had a bunch of  a bunch of bookings on kevin for the show for zach and mary make a porno um and i think they had four  people that week and they were turning into a zach and mary week one of the people was justin long  who's in the movies very funny in the movie and i guess justin is a conan kind of guy first so he 
[02:26:30]  was like look i'm happy to do it but i can't not do conan first so i guess the kevin people like  these the shows are very competitive in terms of bookings nobody ever wants to follow anybody  oh yeah so they get oh there's a zach and mary commercial um one of the few i've ever seen on  tv i don't watch it what channel is this i'm so curious what they're advertising and it says make  a porno how does it say make a porno that's good what what channel is that um the food network 
[02:27:00]  oh god that just sucks like we got a real good rate on the food network come on you know i think  it's channel 11 here in new york we usually go with channel 11 on that big screen but so these cats um  agree the kimmel people said fine like we want justin long on a show so we'll we'll let him do the  conan thing we'll make an exception and i guess what they didn't know was conan was going to be  dark um a week so justin was going to be on conan and then the very next day on kimmel so they went 
[02:27:30]  ballistic um they said that justin had to make a choice and justin was just like well again i choose  conan i like going on conan first so i'm not saying this was kimmel himself because i'm sure he's not in  charge of his own booking but they retaliated or penalized us by not only kicking justin off of  his appearance on kimmel but me as well wow why you i don't know i like i got caught in a crossfire 
[02:28:00]  and and to me it's not a huge deal i've never been on kimmel i'm a leno loyalist and so i i just  you know at one point he made fun of jay early on they're friends now but he used to shred jay when  his show started up so you know out of loyalty i stuck with jay so i've never been on kimmel and  and and i was doing it for this because they're like we got three other people booked and they  want you i was like okay and then everyone was real scared to call me up and tell me like they  booted you off kimmel i was like that's fine that's one less thing for me to do this week one less place 
[02:28:30]  to be on tv where i look fucking rotund and horribly grotesque and morbidly obese i don't want to be on  television i can sit here talk to you guys for hours and hours and hours because there's no  television component or at least is that what you concentrate on when you watch yourself on tv  dude i could care less what i'm saying like i know like oh no trust that i'll bring the funny but all  i do is look at me and go like look at all those chins look at that fucking gut why did i move in  that angle it just showcases the gut just self-hatred look at my fat thighs i inherited my mother's 
[02:29:00]  thighs i hate myself i just and the audience the audience is laughing hysterical and i'm sitting  there like on leno doing a bit about like being so fat i broke a toilet and everyone's having a  great time and i'm i'm telling the story and i'm fully in the moment but i'm watching that  shit like back later on and i'm like i hate you you fat fucking clown you're a fat retarded clown  like real stuff you're yelling at yourself the way zicky yelled at jake 
[02:29:30]  wow but anyway so so it was so it was like i'm fine with not having the book i just thought that  was a really weird shitty thing to do yeah that's really i understand if you're like kick justin off  the show but like out of line why you what the fuck did you do at the same time but who knows i  talk about it now they're like well fuck rogan and fuck kirk robinson as well maybe they boot those  dudes though yeah i don't doubt i don't doubt they would yeah like i don't i shouldn't have  said anything when did that you know what never mind none of that happened like what the fuck when 
[02:30:00]  did that happen with talk shows has it always been like that yeah like always to a certain degree  back in the day early carson days there was one talk show it was carson he wasn't competing against  anybody really and they did it with leno and letterman uh but it's almost like the next night i  i can almost have them go look he's on friday or i almost said we don't want him saturday but i  caught myself a non-showbiz asshole you do you know i can saturday night talk show that i just yeah 
[02:30:30]  the spike thurston show which i am doing actually when i'm in la la land  but you know but to fucking boot kevin who's done so many fucking huge films it's just it's silly and  i don't care it's not an ego thing i'm like how dare you boot me i just thought it was like weird  that's just dirty pool man like that's that makes me like here i was and i'm no great boon to a show  that like you know can do a bit called i'm fucking matt damon have matt damon show up like kimmel gets  huge stars now but i you know if they want to boot me fine but like i'm not inclined to ever go back 
[02:31:00]  at this point yeah like you know it's something else i'm like forget it could you have you done  conan yeah i've done conan what four times okay yeah i've done them all with the exception of kimmel i  never done letterman until like last year this time i went on to promote the book and i killed  and it was great appearance they were like please come back um that's that was fun oh we heard that  it's a great studio well we we made the mistake of doing leno after letterman and that was and then  we weren't asked back to letterman anymore i don't think you made a mistake though because the letter 
[02:31:30]  men people kept saying yes we want you guys back when you guys back when you guys back and they  would not give you a date and then they gave us the exact date that we had booked for leno and then  we had to make a decision all right here's the choice flip a coin but what did you choose we chose  leno but in hindsight with letterman right here down we probably should have just we probably would  have been our fifth appearance yeah oh well let me tell you something dave well now that me and you  were hanging dave yeah instead of a six-hour plane ride to go to get somewhere yeah though leno was 
[02:32:00]  awesome to us he's that was that was like a dream come true both of those appearances he's a really  good guy he's that that dude has had me on i've been on the couch oh my god i think at least 10 times  yeah like i did correspondent pieces from them yeah yeah i've been on that show 40 something times  you kill on that that's why it's that's what's like uh very cool about you kevin it's like it's  not even just all right he's plugging something he'll come in sit down talk to the host or do 
[02:32:30]  something like i i was flipping around one night and yeah you you had a mic and you're out like what  the i'll send kevin a few bucks what what is he doing like it's just i like to chat yeah no  shit it was uh it's very cool very cool obi's got ink on his nose yeah i don't know what boss was  in is it ink no huddle huddle brown nose i don't brown nose fuck you hmm no what are you where is

[02:33:30]  this election yeah yeah she wins in the end yeah oh my god she can uh move on and do whatever she  wants but at the very least she could take over a morning talk show of course a little big one of  those big coffee mugs and just laugh at things which is actually more impressive than the vice  presidency yeah pays better pays way better more people are watching you paying attention  i am not a fan of uh obama i don't like um i really don't like his stand on just about everything 
[02:34:00]  and i'm voting for me which is kind of selfish i think a lot of people think you should just vote  for the best thing for the country right but we're all selfish yeah no one votes like you know i'm voting  for me i fall into his let's rip this guy's balls off and hand them out to some ballless gentleman  and i don't you know i want to keep my balls i'm paying my fucking taxes oh is that what it comes  down to i pay so much in taxes that i've said this so many times i'm a 50 50 partner with the united 
[02:34:30]  states government i feel that's what i do i feel and then my tax money i use it to pay for something  and it's taxed and you know and then you pay tax every year on some other stuff that you own interest  you make is tax is taxed it's it's taxed the shit out of me already yeah and then to hear these  motherfuckers get up there and say it's time that the rich pay their share fuck you you motherfucker i'm  paying more than my goddamn share more than my fucking share so no i don't want to pay more and 
[02:35:00]  i don't want to pay more to so some guy coming up behind me can share my fucking wealth blow me  motherfucker uh this country isn't based and i said a thousand times and i'll say it again not based on  a guarantee of fucking success whether you're great at something or or lucky or anything no guarantees  that you're gonna make it in america this country isn't you come here and make it there's gonna be  homeless people and there's gonna be rich greedy motherfuckers and everything in between and the 
[02:35:30]  poor homeless guy hey maybe it was bad luck maybe he's a dope maybe he's fucking the smartest  motherfucker in the world that turned to alcohol i don't fucking know and my wallet doesn't  fucking care and i don't want uh obama reaching into my pocket even more and shelling it out to  who the fuck knows who i i i i give money to charities i give money personally to things that  i deem charitable that i read in the paper uh and i i do my own fucking giving well i don't need this 
[02:36:00]  to be legislated what i should give to who what so that is the number one piss off the number two  is my second amendment right which i am completely fucking for i'm not a hunter i don't kill things i just  find shooting guns very fun i go to the range if i set up a target at 250 300 yards and i can bag the  same fucking hole in the target the whole magazine it's fun it gives you a feeling of satisfaction i  like talking guns with people i like owning guns i it gives me a feeling of protection in my house 
[02:36:30]  whether it's legitimate or not i feel better about it and it's in the fucking constitution uh and his  stand on the second amendment is abominable it's just horrific what he wants to do um whether he'll  pull it off or not uh depends on you know what congress is like what the supreme court is like  things like that but i'm sorry i just cannot vote for this fucking guy so that's why yeah at least i have 
[02:37:00]  a reason so wait you you don't like obama's yeah pretty much at least he backs it up i'm an impassioned  motherfucker you didn't bring out one soapbox he brought out four and kept stepping up and he  didn't even get to the melanin yet the one thing i want to the one thing i want to bring up because  obama wants us uh the people that are fortunate enough to make a lot of money is help the people  behind us and stuff yeah we do that to so much we do that i i don't i don't want to get into details  but there's there's people in my family and friends that i do that already yeah i just i don't 
[02:37:30]  want to do that to strangers yeah i i would like all right you want me to give more money all right  i'll look around to the people around me that i know well yeah put my family on the payroll and  shit like that you know you you if you get lucky enough in this country and and and then you add a  little fucking talent or this you know somebody you'll blow somebody whatever the fuck it is  that's how you made it that's how you achieved what is called the american dream and when when you 
[02:38:00]  achieve that the first thing people want to do is penalize you for it and the best thing they can  do is what obama is doing is pit class against class which he is doing he's when he talks middle  class he's talking lower class can we fucking stop with the semantics he doesn't mean we have to help  the middle class by giving them a break and stuff he's talking the lower class the middle class will  constantly be shit on uh and and just make ends meet enough to get by and stay middle class he's 
[02:38:30]  talking about bringing up the lower class and i'm sorry you know i lived in my fucking chevy manza for  a while um i was kicked out of my house because my mom decided uh she didn't want a 23 year old  fucking you know uh sapping offer anymore and i had to get myself a good job eventually just a job to  support myself and shit but it it sucked yeah it fucking sucked but i'm not going to say i pulled  myself up by my bootstraps you didn't you were stumbled i backed into major success yes and i want 
[02:39:00]  to keep it i got lucky damn it which is part of this fucking country when i met anthony and i went over  to his house for the first time and we had to drive to boston we're taking a gig disaster he did the  song all that yeah yeah and uh i'm like where's your car because you know we're going to be  living in boston you need a car and he pointed to this thing that was on blocks it was a dodge  aries k car and he was pushing 30 already if if not over 30. oh yeah it was like yeah sometimes 
[02:39:30]  it takes some of the kernels a little longer to pop it certainly does they can be just as tasty  yeah let's get diplomats all right we got point counterpoint going on here i mean i think  we should give kevin a chance as long as the old piece of popcorn can still go out with the young  colonel i would assume you're an obama guy i think he should be heard i'm not even i'm not a political  guy i'm voting for obama as we've had eight years of republican i just want to go back to seeing if a 
[02:40:00]  democrat could do anything but i think you're kidding yourself if you think that it's going to be any  different under anybody else they're always going to text people with money dude i understand i accepted  that early on and sometimes it bugs me but i'm like you know what i make a lot of money i'm okay  to give it up if that's how everyone's playing fine it's it is irritating though when you give up over  fifty percent of your salary of your some people go like well fuck you your salary is really huge  i'm like yeah but i i earned that man yeah yeah something to earn it maybe you don't like movies 
[02:40:30]  maybe you do but they earn money for people and it's all relative it's like all right you make  40 you make 40 grand up too where it's like i help out a lot you know how many people i got on  the fucking payroll yeah like it ain't five it ain't 12 it's a bunch and and and that's the thing  with with uh i'm not talking about huge corporations because those are the ones in the news the swindling  motherfuckers that should be strung up by their heels and and decapitated that ran these companies  into the fucking ground and and are fucking a lot of people over but i'm talking about businesses 
[02:41:00]  that make over 250 000 a year there's plenty of them which just mom and pop operations make that  much right and they joe plumber joe plumber and they they they employ whether it's two people  20 people regardless if their taxes go up enough they are gonna they're not gonna go well i'm gonna  have to guess i'm gonna have to fucking live on less or they're gonna go uh dude i'm sorry i'm gonna  have to fucking let you go i gotta pay taxes so now where's that guy gonna go what does he do how 
[02:41:30]  does that help the economy by taxing these rich elitist motherfuckers that he's pitting everyone  against when they're employing people uh again i'm not talking about the big corporate scumbags that have  fucked up uh severely uh i don't like his also i understand i'm gonna be taxed regardless of who's in  there i don't like where my money will be going i want my money to be going uh and i believe me i  don't like where it's going now i don't like that it's going over to iraq uh for a war that's lasted 
[02:42:00]  longer than world war ii our involvement in there and uh and really i'm not seeing much coming out of  this uh i would like that over with um but but his his use of our tax dollars i think is going to be  one of these socialist fucking uh pro a lot of these programs that are just feel good do nothing  programs i'd rather see the money go there than where it's going currently i would i would rather 
[02:42:30]  just see you reach one person i mean i know it's a lot of money to reach one person but like you know  you teach a person to fish yeah but but they need money to somebody's got to show them that person has  to get paid because nobody does shit for fucking free in this country they can buy all the fish  they want with the money there absolutely it's time to start legalizing some of those things that  nobody wants to talk about yeah prostitution drugs put a tax seal on it treat it like booze and  fucking cigarettes i have no problem with that it's such a weird provincial country and very conservative 
[02:43:00]  when it comes to the things that people like doing that maybe aren't the best for you but  in a world where you legalize smokes and you legalize booze why do you draw the line yeah  where's the line drawn why why not legalize fucking weed man if you're smoking weed and and you're  driving how much worse is that than uh drinking and driving i don't think it's worse at all i i think  my guess my educated guess i'm a very good driver when i'm stoned never done it but if i had to guess 
[02:43:30]  yeah i think i'm an excellent driver i think i pay much more attention to the road i'm dialed in  yeah i'm a safer driver when i'm stoned if i was ever to do that right then what if i was not stoned  drinking that's not an advocate that's not why we should legalize weed i'm just saying it's not that  big a deal or maybe you know drinking is so much worse than smoking weed it just is it's worse i think  it's worse for you balls in place for it it's like look if if they legalize weed and you got caught 
[02:44:00]  driving under the influence you get treated the same way you get treated if you get caught driving  under the influence of booze and you're not gonna hurt anyone because you're only going 10 miles an  hour either 10 or 100 you're not even gonna leave the house right you're gonna be sitting there  watching like back to the future for a thousandth time oh no he said back to i've had times where  i've had so much i wanted to do in a day and the second you sit and maybe puff a little yes uh you  just don't do anything i've lost weeks yeah you don't do anything i'll tell you what happened to me 
[02:44:30]  recently the good folks at panasonic god bless them dude named ed jand over there is a friend of  ours he called me up and he was like would you like a 103 inch television hey i said oh my god  whose cock do i have to suck to get that because i will suck it dry and he said no buddy and he sent  me a 103 inch television now 103 inch television is essentially like living in a multiplex  real close to the screen because i keep that fucking screen two feet from the edge of my bed and i  lay face down in my bedroom my bedroom dude i never leave my bedroom did you ever see the people 
[02:45:00]  versus larry flint yeah yeah remember that one point where they closed the vault door and years go by  that is totally my fucking room i go in my room i don't fucking leave so i got this 103 inch uh  television two feet from my bed at that point you're not watching the movie you are in the  fucking movie and the and they sent me a blu-ray player and i was never one of those dudes that was  like hd blu-ray i didn't give a shit a bunch of regular dvds i didn't want to get involved in

[02:46:00]  nose i was like this is my same nose fuck i'm just fatter but that i that that has changed my life so  much i never liked leaving the house before i really don't like leaving the house down and there are days  where i'd like wake up nine o'clock get the kid off to school look at my schedule what do i have to do  nothing i fucking bake hard and i watch blu-ray dvds all day sweet and for that if they want to  take 50 of my salary just as long as i'm free to do that that's fucking fine as long as you can do 
[02:46:30]  that i'm not allowed to do that no legitimately and i'm not gonna get all woody harrelson and be  like legalized pot but jesus christ give me something you're taking all my money give me  something yeah can i get something in return something legalize something that i would like to do  yeah yeah not even help me out you know i'm doing fine i got my blu-ray i got  totally i'm not asking for a handout or fucking assistance take my money put it in a social  program jot a signature on a bill that would help me out just let me get some fucking weed dude i  won't bother anybody i just want to watch my blu-ray and get high man every once in a while i'll get 
[02:47:00]  fucked by my kevin smith's first movie in 10 years coming out this week it's called my bedroom  a documentary of his closet mongo saying a tractor trail is 102 inches wide that's how  fucking big that tv is wow width wise yeah yeah this tv goes from um let me see  fuck you could go from the end of this xm thing to the end of almost to the end of that wall it's  that wide it's pretty pretty yeah tv it's the sad thing though that's not even the biggest they just 
[02:47:30]  came out with a bigger one i heard yeah your tv is my dick plus a hundred  i'm just i'm having a little to watch a blu-ray dvd projected on your three-inch dick sir  that's how good blu-ray is they could project it right on jimmy's cock i'd still be watching it all  high staring at it can you move that hair jimmy keith keith the cop who takes care of a lot of my uh  my business decided um uh he wanted a uh movie theater in my basement so apparently that's what's 
[02:48:00]  going in as we speak get that tv dude um i i want it at this point i'm going with uh uh projection  on i think it's an 11 11 foot screen or something is that the panasonic oh look at that  fucking thing 102 yeah that doesn't look like mine well call up the panasonic one 103 but now they  have a 150 or something like that am i gonna have to get that i don't have enough room in the  bedroom for the 103 that's just in your fucking bedroom it's phenomenal just gonna be irradiated 
[02:48:30]  you're gonna turn into a superhero everything that happened to me prior to this moment in time  was just prelude to this tv  i grew up loving tv dude i sat in my kitchen i had a little like what i'm 10 inch black and white tv that  i watched batman on after school all the commercials for fucking uh perfection and  like that i grew up tv is my best fucking friend and i don't even watch like network tv now it's all 
[02:49:00]  about dvd and shit like that but i love that machine i love it so much and when they handed me the big  one i was just like oh you could take my wife and my child leave me this television that is exactly how  i fucking that's your tv yes there it is damn is that fucking huge look how tall it is next  three come on thank you sir that is insane and i don't say that to like show off or be like no  i got it for fucking free i would never paid for it it's like a 70 000 television i would never 
[02:49:30]  spend that kind of money on what's 102 inches eight and a half next year it'll be two thousand  dollars at best buy or something well it's already once they came out with the 150 it went from 70  grand to like 40 grand yeah did your wife freak into the bedroom or is she cool she gave me a lot  of shit about putting in the bedroom because they they kind of uh frightened us with like our bedroom  is it's like a bedroom suite there's a big living room attached to it but the actual portion where  the bed is you step up to it's a little platform area nice and it's surrounded by three walls so they  were like if you put it in this confined space it's just gonna up the temperature by like 40 degrees 
[02:50:00]  and i was like you know what i don't give a fuck i'm fat i sweat anyway i'd rather have a reason to  sweat but they put it in it doesn't heat up no no not at all it must have some sort of fan or cooler  which i never hear it don't matter though i'm stoned i don't give a shit yeah i don't care how  hot it is is that bad when i fucking breathe i don't care listen to you jimmy bad for your eyes  i'm 38 dude i figure i got like what 12 good years left the way i'm living i want to live with that tv 
[02:50:30]  man yeah i love that tv so much growing up the same thing though just sitting in front of  on the fucking television constantly and commercials too i didn't know what watch  everything panned out it panned out for me worked out yes it totally did a lot of people like don't  let your kid watch too much tv it panned out i know that's where i got healthy fucking living doing  what i do so every inspiration i got i owe it all to television television that was it i would sit in  front of that fucking thing constantly i love my tv that's really for the way you talk about obama it's 
[02:51:00]  like he's trying to take your tv he's trying to take my tv he's trying to take well he's trying  to take my second favorite thing which are guns i point my guns at my tv you shot a tv haven't you  uh years ago i shot a tv out at calverton used to be able to bring anything out of that range out east  now they've kind of buckled down a little more out there you can't bring shit people would drop off  washing machines and just blast it with shotguns all day a lot of fucking fun though and uh no but when i  finally got my uh my pistol license um i just decided they all think i'm crazy because every 
[02:51:30]  week i'm like yeah i got a new one got a new one and then i uh i have because i don't have kids around  the house which is great right so i could just fucking load them up leave them wherever i want  all right kind of like that i just bought a um you have a loaded cocked gun sitting next to the bed  no never have any kids but you bought a crib you put a bunch of guns in it guns in the crib  never uh i never keep one in the in the chamber either i'm just like if you can't  fucking rack that thing in a split second you don't deserve to have it just fucking brew but i uh 
[02:52:00]  my my bedtime defense weapon is my uh sig 45 which i just got a laser for this  fucking thing is hysterical you it's so cheating at the range it's it's just bam bam bam right when  the laser where the laser is that's where the fucking uh uh the rounds going you can actually  shoot that gun it'll just hang out by the front door waiting for a burglar to show up yeah it's 
[02:52:30]  like here patrol my house and it just walks around it's like an ad at something  yeah it's uh i i just i always liked him and then i got i picked up that other one  this one would and i don't like the idea that he wants to bring back this assault weapons ban which uh  to me is it's that again is semantics because an assault weapon is what a semi-automatic rifle  you could get one of those anyway without all the cool plastic grips on it and the flash suppress 
[02:53:00]  suppressor and the folding stock even a folding stock i could say all right they might think because  it's easily concealed fuck it don't even want a folding stock i just want to be able to own an ar-15  uh it's like you're speaking martian i don't even know what the fuck you're saying man it's  i know so nothing about guns that i'm just nodding picture picture okay picture the coolest looking  guns he wants to take all those away what about um no country for old men yeah oh not the cattle 
[02:53:30]  prod thing i want that one the braining thing but that other gun he had with the massive silencer on it  oh yeah yeah he had a shotgun no he had a shotgun with a silencer yeah i got i got this is the gun  that you like yeah that was something out of aliens man i know it's the best isn't it it's  what you need is like the the um that gear that they wore with the arm it was like a steady cam get  rigged yeah on the aliens yeah you gotta explain to kevin where you push up the uh the um fs 2000 
[02:54:00]  explain to kevin where you get your gun ideas from video games yeah yeah that oh really he gets  it's no i can't relate to that because i play like nhl 08 and they don't have any guns in that  game kevin just goes out and buys hockey sticks if there's a cool weapon in a video game then he  goes out and then i go like wow that's cool so i gotta buy that make me understand this like you  watch something you play something like halo yeah they put an actual existing gun in their hands no  i play like call of duty 4 and uh that got me where i wanted to um fs 2000 so then you can 
[02:54:30]  find one you could you could get that gun in real life uh yeah yeah which i decided to do i picked up a  couple of those uh that i thought was good some of the scopes i got an acog uh scope which is  what the one they use in the marines use uh i got one of those a holographic scope which is why  you're mad about the prospect of obama getting elected less money for guns well no and less guns  he he really is an anti-gun guy he doesn't want people to have uh uh personal uh carry licenses let 
[02:55:00]  me ask you this though yes you've spoken about guns on the air many times yeah people know a lot  of the specific uh hardware you have um armaments what do they call them sure they call it in the um  ordinance ordinance by ordinance if they outlaw a gun that you have do you have to then turn it  into somebody no that would that would i think cause a revolution you're grandfathered in okay like  the assault weapons that people had before the assault weapons ban you were able to keep those  the second they start going hello that's when you just start firing that's where it ain't even 
[02:55:30]  just gonna be me you will see a bunch of redneck motherfuckers in the midwest just firing at you  know uh uh federal agents coming to get your guns because that's that would be the ultimate if agents  come and come to collect your guns uh they they've done it though in certain cities they have done that  right detroit um dc is city where the gun control worked so well keeping the civilians uh that wanted  registered um firearms that they took a safety course for fbi background checks um gun control worked so 
[02:56:00]  well uh there the the murder capital uh because what's easier to to what's easier than to rob someone  when you know they're not fucking carrying it's great it's fucking easy pickings detroit another  fucking city where you just can't own a fucking gun uh and and it's it's these high crime areas  that the civilians who might want to have one in his night table so if some fucking savage wants to 
[02:56:30]  come in your window perhaps you got a fighting chance uh that no they say no you can't sorry you know  how you combat that how you escape by going to see zach and mary make a porno thank you nice  i forgot we were here for a reason you gotta do that i like talking but every once in a while you  got your secondary you gotta get that out that was a jimmy norton plug it's smooth i learned from  the best i tell you because it does tie in actually because in in kevin's movie they're shooting it's  just on the face and back why don't we take a quick break let kevin automatic either it's man 
[02:57:00]  kevin's wall some food you're gonna cock it i never saw anybody swallow their own bullets before  more with kevin smith stay there  do it do it do it  my favorite moment oh god when the dude gets electrocuted like tries to take off batman's mask  and he gets shocked and then like ledger jumps over there's like 
[02:57:30]  the show uh continues through the break i don't know why we broke we probably should just continue  kevin smith in studio and we're just talking about we were blowing dark nights yeah dark nights later  we're still blowing he's still sucking it just talking about our favorite he's ledger moments  from uh dark night i don't want to tell uh pal talk uh people i'm sorry the computer line's down so  if you then tuned in the radio and are listening like you should be uh that would be nice yeah there's  a problem uh here with the do it do it do it do it do it no so i can let my gut out 
[02:58:00]  you can let's talk about that kevin you said that you wanted i think was it on leno you said  you want to disappear for a year or two i put it up and i was writing in the blog and i mentioned it  and a lot of people picked it up after i did the leno appearance and talked about  breaking a toilet and shit like that and suddenly it became yeah there's nothing to talk about dude  it's not even like i don't know what i did i know exactly what i did we made a movie  i wasn't in and i was like fuck it i'm gonna eat and i started eating and ate all the way through 
[02:58:30]  and like making a movie can be stressful so i was stress eating then i got home and i worked you know  cut the movie got it all together and then we had downtime so i just started getting high and eating  more can't really diet when you're getting stoned do you work at all do you do like never i'm so  sedentary i don't even walk dude like there are days where i literally just like the only walking i do  is from the bed to the toilet i'm like i know i'm not sitting here crying going how did this happen  how can i make it better i know exactly what to do you eat less you fucking exercise but i'm waiting 
[02:59:00]  until november 1st until all this shit's done then i just want to go the fuck away and drop like 100  pounds easy where do you want to go do you want to go to a place i'm gonna go to my house just not  you know maybe not smoke weed for about a couple months i hate to find a way to be able to smoke weed  and not eat not eat yeah because that is that there's nothing better in the world i don't have  apples apples are fun apples suck celery what's your fucking what is your poison if you're high to just  like um it almost doesn't matter as long as it's processed and has a lot of sugar horrible like kill 
[02:59:30]  i could kill two ben and jerry's within the span of 20 minutes just sitting there watching tv yeah totally  i'm like oh the fucking uh the uh chubby hubby's gone i might as well start in the mint chocolate  cookie as well what am i trying to do win a contest you know something like that you sit  there and cognitively reframe it but like it got to a point like i've been fat my whole life but  then there have been some times i'm less fat this is the fattest i've ever been like now i look in 
[03:00:00]  the mirror and i see my father and my father i got i'm not getting teared up i got bacon in my  teeth it sounded like i was getting all choked up but i have bacon in my teeth you were getting us all  uncomfortable i'm in the midst of telling a story about how fat i am i'm like let me pull this pork fat  oh my god he twixt my teeth but um i look in the mirror i totally see from the waist up i see my  father because my father got had a very big gut but he had a very thin lower body and then from the  waist down i'm double fucked i see my mother my mother has huge fucking thighs and big hips and  shit so i got like the absolute worst genetics that in terms of like the end result has been 
[03:00:30]  i've got the worst of both of those worlds two wonderful people but the worst physical attributes  and then on top of it i just fueled it with a lot of eating and shit like that so i get it i'm not  like i don't understand why this happens to me i let myself fucking go to an insane degree so once  the movie's done because they keep you running with the flick that's the really that's the thing the  only thing that really kills me about it is like as i go out there to promote the flick you got to 
[03:01:00]  wind up on tv a lot and i'm just like oh like i don't want to see myself oh shit and like i did like  a killer leno appearance last week there's more bacon um but at the same time like i i didn't  even want to watch it when i was done like you know you record it to see how you did later on  i step out the fucking back from back backstage and i'm like oh you fat fucking retard look at  you i know you know what it is like you you are so obviously you want to lose weight uh you know you 
[03:01:30]  you know for maybe health reasons so you're around not even that i don't even give a shit about  that hey you don't even care about that i mean i i don't it's been such a good life so far i'm not  i don't have a death wish but at the same time like what's it going to be more of the same in terms  of professionally speaking like i've made eight movies now and i've done a lot of speaking gigs  and i've done more i've accomplished more in my life than i ever imagined i would you're a god so  not even that but just like it's great you know and then i got a wonderful wife who i absolutely 
[03:02:00]  adore i got a beautiful kid who's really centered and focused and got a good pure heart and head on  her shoulders i'm taking care of the people i love in the world i'm just saying if i died i would not  be like oh man i missed out on so much i'd be like well shit it's just more of the same at this  point so it's a vanity issue it's more vanity dude it's more like i just can't it's it's this vicious  cycle where it's like well i don't want to leave the house i want to stay home and watch tv get high  and eat but then i'm like i don't want to leave the house because i look grotesque because all 
[03:02:30]  i've done is stay home eat watch tv and get stoned and get fatter so it's more vanity than anything but  you have this uh you know pretty strong fucking ticker man and i'm for a dude who's as big as i  am i move around pretty well but when i move i just don't you're talking about weed a lot i don't  remember you ever talking about weed this much is this i fell in love with weed recently dude  real okay so it is recent i mean i smoked weed when i was in in high school at the end post high  school and you know i smoked maybe once a year between now and then but this year i don't know 
[03:03:00]  what it is like i became 18 or something like that where i'm just like this is the answer to  everything like every day like if i sit there and i'm feeling bad about myself or something i'm like  if i get high i won't feel bad anymore and then i gain more weight and then when i get come down i  feel high again so i realize it's ridiculous is there a reason you found weed or you just stumbled  upon a movie with seth rogan you didn't meet anyone from canada did you i did i made a movie  with seth rogan is he from canada he's vancouver holy fuck those canadians will 
[03:03:30]  fuck you up with pot in a good way are you willing to admit you smoking weed dude i have smoked i've  partaken and it's the first time in 20 fucking five years right you've hinted enough on this show  that all right i'm not smoking believe me i haven't had weed in probably fucking you've made a lot of  hints that we kind of let go by like and also you probably can't do it chronically because it's  tough to do that and this job and and let me tell you something two little fucking pokes and i'm like  all right put it away i don't want to i don't want to be mr fucking oh i know i got it down to a 
[03:04:00]  science now too we're talking about five months of this shit so i'm like half a joint will get me  nice and fucked up a full joint i cannot be counted on to like not urinate myself  i cannot be counted on to get the wherewithal to climb my fat ass out of bed and shit in the  toilet i'm like i may shit my pants i'm so stoned simply for convenience  so are you saying that seth rogan is the uh the pusher man or what i wouldn't even say he's 
[03:04:30]  a pusher man but like the whole movie we talked about he's like you and i should get stoned he's  big stoner yeah um and he he was a big fan of the flicks and whatnot so it was a real mutual  admiration society but i said as soon as we're done dude as soon as we're done i will totally  get stoned with you and we'll watch cut footage and blah blah blah nice last day of the shooting  when we were everything was done and and like the next day he was going back to los angeles i was going  back to los angeles and shit like that we got stoned and i was just like this is amazing like you 
[03:05:00]  just become honest and real it's funnier food tastes better you're so creative we didn't even  get to fucking dude like fucking is i've never gotten laid while i've been stoned in my life  i got stoned and had sex with my wife i i thought my head was going to come out my  asshole it was so amazing it was such a profound orgasm it was so fantastic i was like why the  fuck haven't i been doing this for the last 15 years rule man it was it was tremendous but i do 
[03:05:30]  realize everything comes with a price and so you know i i put on weight because of it yeah and then  it gets to the point where it's like i love fucking when i'm stoned but my wife's like i don't want to  fuck you when you're stoned that's when i want to fuck i think that way it's probably not a sexy look  on your face it really is i'm just like i got bacon coming out of my teeth and shit so the weight  let's get down the weight gain because of the pot obviously yeah they're all but to be fair like  while i was uh in pittsburgh shooting the flick before i even started smoking in the winter what's 
[03:06:00]  wrong with you well dude you get to wear layers you get to wear layers so like you're eating more  and shit but i put on a shit ton before i even started smoking weed i'd say weed is probably  responsible for like 15 oh you're in trouble yeah he's in trouble he's only five months in  i just gotta find a way to be able to smoke weed and eat less or not even eat less just not  or overeat like crap too it's like yeah you just want to eat the shittiest stuff i just can't imagine  like you mentioned apples and i remember i passed a burger king the other day and they have this thing 
[03:06:30]  called apple fries where they just cut up a fucking apple and put it in a fry container and i'm like  i'm sitting there going okay if i was stoned would i would i you know i don't when you're  stoned everything tastes better and shit would i enjoy it but i think no harsh my buzz you don't  want that i think i would be like apples sure you don't want to walk out with a big fucking regular  fries and who else who else i want to eat a box of cereal that's what i want a whole box of cocoa  who else looks forward to kevin smith coming back a year from now going dude herwin i mean 
[03:07:00]  it's not a gateway for me though like i saw what muse went through with heroin weed though  weed is about as bad as i can do i don't i'm not into like coke and by the way you know i i i was  suspicious that that that laugh of seth rogan's was a was a pot laugh and now now it's uh was he  smoking pot before work all comes he came he came pretty pro like he he if he if he was smoking while  we're working i couldn't tell i never think he works and then smoke where's wrong we should call seth 
[03:07:30]  rogan i never knew this about canadians i i i had no idea canadians were such  fucking stoners and like they're kind of source yes as well holy shit i they're operating heavy  machinery they're doing they're doing interviews i have never seen girl i know never seen her smoke  anyone my brother even smoke so much pot and be so completely functional yeah ever 
[03:08:00]  in my life she smokes a lot i constantly like cigarettes right constantly high and couldn't  tell they're high that's the one good thing that is really rolling joints with one hand and  fucking you know they they can fucking roll perfectly right right oh i'm dropping bottles  that's the only problem with traveling too where i'm still not brave enough to bring weed on the  plane no can't do it don't want to get busted although my feeling is like they ain't looking for 
[03:08:30]  fucking weed anymore they're looking for terrorists but still i don't want to be the guy you know  look at the turkish so the turkish police in uh midnight express they're looking for bombs i don't  want to wind up in prison being like oh billy billy but um the thing the thing that i that i so i  can't bring it on the plane so i get places and then i can't get high for a few days so i get to take  a few days off look at the bleachers we got at least three uh guys out there caring you know  it doesn't bother me like like oh boy i don't have i'm not thinking about like getting high but if 
[03:09:00]  someone's got some and they're passing around i'll take a little but this is a new thing this is a new  thing for you too yeah yeah yeah it's been like i said 25 fucking years i never wasted weeds wasted  on the young like you know when you're a kid you should be like working towards something and and  being ambitious and whatnot then get to a place in life where you're like i'm satisfied with what 
[03:09:30]  i've done you could be a lazy myself yes all right what the hell i'm gonna i'm gonna start smoking  jessica yeah a little let's do a stoner show poke here oh my god that would be heaven i haven't  done it stoner show 10 years easy easy i i have sat and had discussions that i thought were probably  the funniest things creativity that you're coming out and then like the next day or even a few hours  later if you don't smoke more you're just kind of like what was i saying that was i thought that 
[03:10:00]  was really funny but then you're sober and you're like yuck and you're like that isn't really that  funny but i was laughing till i shit yeah i was fucking the eye was crying my sides hurt such a  great feeling it makes bad comedy fantastic yeah like you can say you can pop you can get stone  popping joanna man and you're like this is brilliant why have i not appreciated for its simplicity  i got high and i watched the dark knight the joker made sense finally i'm sitting there going like  what he's saying is absolutely sensible like you know i don't it doesn't make me want to go out 
[03:10:30]  and become an urban terrorist but i'm like he's right he's absolutely right you'll never know the  insight we got off of watching top gun uh until you're stoned and you watch it and then you're  very insightful a lot of things going on in that movie that i just never caught i advocated highly  man i advocated i know that's irresponsible for some people look if you have a personality that  lent leads or lends toward being addictive yeah stay away perhaps it's not for you because it could 
[03:11:00]  become a gateway drug but if you're responsible enough to be able to be like this is it i want  to go no further than this i find that it's more healthy for me beneficial healthfully beneficial for  me because i have stopped smoking cigarettes as much as i used to i used to be a two pack a day kind  of guy i started smoking more weed i'm like i get nothing out of cigarettes i get absolutely nothing  man but like i smoke half a joint i'm like it does something for me so mother fuck a cigarette you  know that's just something now i do if i'm bored but not where i'm like you know back in the day i'd 
[03:11:30]  be like fiending going downstairs smoking cigarettes now i can just sit here for for  fucking hours because i'm like i don't give a shit about cigarette somebody gotta join me a different  story that's the only problem though you can't do it all publicly hey we got no no we got something  from kevin i uh i'm telling you i i we should get some weed and do a show stone show although i'll tell  you one thing i was stoned on the air once and it was um ron and fez show because it's you know  after this show and should so i was done so i kind of went out did a little bit and then i had to be 
[03:12:00]  on the air for uh what what were they doing family feud yeah and they're doing family feud and i was  doing the last thing where it's like you got to pick the the best answer to the question it was like  uh what i can't remember the question see it was the worst answer danny knows it was  name name something that you get dressed up for yeah yeah and i said the opera 
[03:12:30]  the worst fucking answer survey says you're an idiot absolutely dude who are you the  fucking elephant man you asked like halloween was number one halloween was the like the number  one answer i totally wasn't even thinking in that i'm like you put on your suit and go to the opera  mr mr like fucking what it was like a time machine you dial back to like 1828 i had a 
[03:13:00]  fucking monocle mr improv came up with the opera and i had nothing as far as improv went and being  able to think on my feet and shit like be quick and stuff that goes away you should know i don't  i don't feel like it certainly doesn't enhance it but i got stoned and had to do uh uh i forgot that  i had to do a show gotcha i totally forgot i had to do uh edgar wright the guys that do uh  shawn of the dead oh yeah they had a tv show called tag based yeah and simon peck tv show called space 
[03:13:30]  that ran in england for like two years really great cult show that was finally coming out on dvd here  so they had this screening at the arc light in los angeles and i agreed to be the moderator  and i got stoned beforehand i totally spaced i'm like oh i got something to do tonight so i was like  fuck i got to try to pull it together and i was able to do the whole show stone but i just immediately  called attention to it i was like look i may be a little off tonight because i got baked beforehand  and this country celebrates excess like you wouldn't fucking believe man because that audience was  like everyone was so happy that i was stoned you know it's like well who knew who knew that i was that 
[03:14:00]  good why aren't there more people in hollywood that are honest like you like you come in here  you have no problem i'm gonna tell everyone i'm smoking pot and it's a new thing like you just don't  get that from uh all the people that come and see us there's some that do most people just like the  private life i guess no it's more about an image or something they're just so worried about what's  your money it's all money it'll cost you money if the wrong endorse if the right endorsements are  dropped or if you're associated with it's all about money man or so-and-so won't use you or you 
[03:14:30]  can't do this or maybe a studio won't hire you or something like that yeah it's all money well  you know what i got no interest anybody who wouldn't want to be involved with me because i said that i  smoke weed all right that rules yeah we got something out of you today unless it was my wife  the pot if my wife was just like look i don't want to be involved with you i'd be like well  shit i better drop this quick because who the fuck else is gonna fuck me i will for another part in  the movie done and done you have to be able to let's talk about that malcolm thing that we talked  about back on cbs right right it was fucking the most eye-popping spellbinding stories he was 
[03:15:00]  telling me like dudes will literally suck his cock and he's rolling his gut on the top of their head  he said he took his gut and put it over their head like earmuffs and he was going you  fucking love that fat gut and they were like i'm fucking i was like oh my god i could never imagine  doing that with a woman yeah right or even a guy i can't imagine doing that period that dude really  embraced that his fucking job man wow i was like what a free way to live man what a wonderful  free person to be and shit like that but how about the psyche of the guy kneeling how about 
[03:15:30]  i want to blow a guy and i'd also like fat out of my head yeah that is kind of weird both those in  the check box that's it but i guarantee you there'd be like gay dudes out in the world who'd be like  why do you want to like uh titty-fuck a woman or something like that yeah that's disgusting yeah  yeah it all comes out to a matter of taste yeah whatever you're into sure you know either making  your dad uh disappointed or happy or not imagine you know you're the kid with the big fat on your 
[03:16:00]  head and yeah like who's dad like malcolm's dad is now passed but whose dad is more disappointed  malcolm's dad or the dude who's sucking malcolm's dick and malcolm's gut as an earmuff oh here's a picture of my  son i never thought mcdonald yeah you know my son johnny someone's gut on his head he's uh  sucking another man's cock yeah take a look at the boy loves cock that story killed me he was telling  me that shit i was just like that's good and he was there it was like the night of the premiere we  had the premiere in los angeles on the on monday or something like that so my brother's out my brother's 
[03:16:30]  gay my brother's married to a guy and he's been married for like 13 years it was like 90 years in  the straight community so he was there too my brother and watching my brother and malcolm talk  about it well talk about being gay and shit i was it was i was stoned and it was wonderful is it just  like wild sex stories oh my god it is like apparently being gay is like you take the male um instinct  sexual instinct and you know everyone's just like oh men are dogs fucking triple it because it's like 
[03:17:00]  you're not there's nobody to keep you in check anymore nobody keeps you in check like there's no woman  going you've gone too far you have to be presentable it's just unabashed like naked raw  let's try this now i'm gonna pound your nostril and it doesn't doesn't do it for me like never  once is i'm sitting there going like man i want to eat a cock but i'm just like what an amazing way  to live like you know like it but everything comes with a price tag like there's a bit of self-proving  involved for some people there's salvation for others 
[03:17:30]  they gotta deal with judgment in public but at the same time like for that 20 minutes or an hour  however long it lasts they're so utterly free ravaging uh each other yes every conservative's  nightmare that conversation those things that those guys were saying was just every conservative's  nightmare all the things they're just that's what they're fighting against so hard i think that the  worst part about like getting blown by a guy would have to be this sound this is what i'm guessing as  they get their nose all the way to your torso because they're still getting this the breathing 
[03:18:00]  what brought that to mind man i don't know oh that's horrible  i would imagine it would be the moment after you came and then you were like oh my god a guy just  blew me wow yeah or i just blew a guy look at this man's like hairy like his his knuckles have  been hitting a heavy bag like wow you work out just like i do yeah but the trade-off the trade-off 
[03:18:30]  is if you can live through that you'll have wild unchecked fucking sexual experience apparently  nothing too uh crazy yeah yeah speaking of gay i could go for a seg here william shatner what is  he's gay well no the george takai stuff oh this is it today oh is this him is it shatner talking  about not being invited yeah he's pissed off yeah it might be worth the play is shatner talking about  zach and mary make a porno in theaters yes i liked it i like the movie starring jimmy norton 
[03:19:00]  when's your book coming out sir on november 4th i hate your guts that's a great cover thank you  fantastic i'm very photogenic that's awesome the man who took my picture treated me like that guy  treated irene cara in fame oh that was such a heartbreaking showing those horrid tits that  she had is there a problem yeah there's rotten brown candy corn let's see what this is about 
[03:19:30]  well i you know the whole thing makes me feel badly uh the poor man uh i i there's such a sickness  there it's so painfully obvious that there is a psychosis there con um i don't know what his  original uh thing about me he tasks me no i tasks i didn't read his book that was printed many years ago 
[03:20:00]  but apparently i didn't let somebody have a close-up i literally don't know him i didn't  know him very well on the series he'd come in for a day or two he was your fucking helmsman  shit he's saying that he didn't know sulu no party played and then on the movies  there occasionally i didn't know the man it's every job you had up until tj hooker i didn't know  that and even after that yeah i didn't know the man so these two don't like each other no  i guess not what's the history george sakai didn't invite him to the wedding george sakai 
[03:20:30]  said that he thinks that shatner is a glory whore and and you know that that actor that everyone  kind of portrays him as so he didn't invite him to his his wedding that he just had recently and i  guess shatner's talk somebody asked shatner talking some smack there's an instance where answering  honestly not not a good idea not as good saying uh that he was a little upset with not getting a  close-up maybe or just like when you come to the point where you're going i barely know the man it's  like you have spent the last 40 years of your life in tv shows and movies with this guy at 
[03:21:00]  conventions like come on dude like yeah i mean i get i guess you can make the argument of like i  don't know him like personally i don't know his the inner workings of his mind and heart but yeah  the way the way he comes off it's just like he come in for a day it's like if he walked up to the  street he'd be like your name i forgot did we work together yeah well he's probably shatner's  probably so arrogant on the set that he knows he's the fucking star so everybody else is probably  uh second fiddle he gets the close-ups do you think it's accurate to say patently instead of 
[03:21:30]  patently patently that's the canadian way yeah yeah i would say patently i mean i'm that but that's  the type of i mean i'm a patently guy it's common knowledge patently i wouldn't uh i don't know the  man yeah i don't know him here's uh what the kai had to say about shatner on star trek  the experience of working with william shatner that was unpleasant for you well you know bill is 
[03:22:00]  the star of the show thank you the show he likes to be the star of the show and you know he likes the  attention that is focused on him it's uh you know a big shining demanding ego i love the way to talk  the big shining demanding ego he's he that's what he likes i happen to like a pair of balls that have  been sweating for a little while yeah especially off a bicycle seat that's so strange man that you 
[03:22:30]  can work somebody that long yeah like i i tell you i don't know the man never heard of him he's like  he's like peter denying christ if sulu was a christ-like figure shatner's just like i tell  you i don't know him the cock crows three times wow that's fucked up but you know shatner comes off  like that i think he's uh we have we've had him on a couple yeah yeah actually he is he's coming in 
[03:23:00]  so i don't understand why he gives us a really good radio where did it where did it like who did  somebody come forward first to say i'm probably did i didn't go to the wedding or did somebody just  ask them and was it a kind of leading question they got caught in or i just can't imagine that  dude making a stink about like i didn't get invited to the wedding yeah and was everyone else there  like was nichelle nichols there was was uh the rest of the nimoy was leonard nimoy there that's  right i don't know jimmy i don't know i don't know them there's a lot of details missing 
[03:23:30]  from that story leonard who i hey don't know the man iraq uh brought me a couple clips from your uh  your smodcast you still doing the smodcast yeah we do i think uh we're up to episode 66 how do they  hear these nice online just on your side on the world online but i used to play on xm and then we  stopped doing it yeah well merger kind of took care of a lot of things probably because they didn't pay  you they were they ran for free and i was nice because i'm mad at them not you of course you know  eventually they should throw a few bucks your way there was one day where i was in the car and 
[03:24:00]  clicking around on on uh the radio on on on the xm and all of a sudden i saw my name and scott's name  come up and i actually i'd heard the shows the only times i recorded the show but i had to sit in the  car and listen to it i was like i'm on the radio i was real delighted with it how cool is that but yeah  we just we put them up on the on quick stop uh entertainment.com it's all online we used to love  having that on the channel it's a it's a funny show it's only like usually an hour every week  but it's just me and him just kind of free associating iraq gave me two clips he says 
[03:24:30]  they're both worth playing while you're here so uh aliens uh pawn the jews okay i don't know i don't  know okay we'll find out the religious people can differentiate between an alien life form and  their belief structure because even though there's nothing in the bible to promote the idea that there's  anybody but us in this universe they've never come it there's nothing in the bible that's against it  uh there's nothing in the bible that thou shalt not believe that aliens exist or something like  yeah yeah so i think they're cool with it it doesn't affect their beliefs at all i don't know 
[03:25:00]  in fact the aliens like look the man that you called jesus was indeed the son of god we know god  yeah we've never no no they that's come on it's fucking ridiculous but they're like there is a  intergalactic consciousness that you people refer to as god that does indeed exist like to me that  would fucking rock the entire religious world i think it would rock the jewish community the most  if an alien came out and said that jesus was indeed the son of god because their faith it's not 
[03:25:30]  predicated on this but one of the tenets of their faith is they're still waiting for the messiah to come  the differences between jews and christians is that christians believe the messiah came and he was  jesus christ yeah jews are still waiting for them so there would be a victory there yeah christians  everywhere be like we fucking face boom if it fell we told you you were wrong the jews are like all  right well you know fair enough right on man this one tells me that's kind of what a stone show  would sound like yeah yeah and that's conversations like that yeah it's a good show what is it that 
[03:26:00]  keith in new jersey says it's totally possible to not know each other you want to go there i would like  to hear all right keith uh we got kevin smith in today make sure you go see his new movie next  friday keith keith hey man keith keith are you gonna keith keith are you gonna go see zach and  mary make a porno oh definitely right on all right tell me your theory dude i've always wanted to tell  you back in 94 i was not the hicks oh right on yeah so was i then i made the movie about it and i 
[03:26:30]  stopped being that guy you know the funny the funny thing for me is i couldn't get behind  a mall rats back then only because i'm from jersey and my dad lives in eden prairie minnesota  oh get out of here i couldn't make the leap between the two the combo of those two places  disparate places listen um i mean i expect anthony and obi uh not to get this but you as a director  i gotta kind of call you out because it's very easy to be on stage or be on the set with somebody 
[03:27:00]  and be in character and then as soon as your bit is over as soon as it takes over you walk off and  you don't see those people i mean even if you're doing the same character for all those years of  shatter that's that's the thing that's that's why i just i mean i get what you're saying there have  been people that i who've been in the flicks uh who came in for cameos or whatever and i can't say  that i truly know those people but i haven't made that flick for 30 fucking years 30 years it's a  franchise these motherfuckers they sat at conventions next to each other absolutely they 
[03:27:30]  like did other things during the uh every table read it's an ensemble piece but the cast isn't that  large where it's just like who plays sulu again like yeah i gotta imagine they know each other  popularity never went away yeah i kind of get shatter's because if you listen to shatter day  he even says i don't even when he looks at all their work but he looks at trek from the 60s  he says i don't know who that young guy is so for him to be looking at george takei all these 
[03:28:00]  years later and takei is holding still has this hurt feeling grudge feel about you know whatever  ego problem shatter had back in the 60s i get it shatter's like let it go already  right he's still like why just you know shatter's a jerk you know so well the cop just doesn't like  him and shatter's an egomaniac and they probably didn't know each other that well on set you would  just see each other and you would talk a little bit but he probably is saying i don't know the man  on an intimate level but after 30 years you're doing table reads and and you're going to cast 
[03:28:30]  parties of course you know it was just a weird thing for him to say in terms of like i barely  know the man it's one of those ways you knock somebody with you know oh i don't know who is  that well it's just like that works for almost anybody else but like a dude that you shared the  bridge with and almost in the lion's share of your work i know it's not even like they were in some  weird ensemble show where like sulu was somewhere else and kirk was somewhere else they were on the  same bridge yeah like sitting fucking he stared at the back of his head yeah and they've definitely

[03:36:00]  clean yeah whereas we're so very not filthy whenever people are happy they burst into song  in our movie they just start fucking each other it's so like our movie's so candid like to a fault  and that movie is very you know engineered to a fault but totally totally watchable yeah i enjoyed  it wow for what it is that is i look forward to watching it stone to be honest yeah well anything  i'm still not gonna go see it sorry kevin i don't think i'll see it i think you need a kid 
[03:36:30]  this is for the parents out there yeah people who have to go well they like that chihuahua movie  too you know oh that one i could you gotta make a dog movie kevin no i can't do it yes no and i got  dogs too but i just can't get my head around making a dog movie talk about umpteen gazillion dollars  worth of fucking uh ticket sales trailer first fucking like hit the net people were just like this is the  end of cinema this is abhorrent this is terrible yeah yeah but it didn't matter that wasn't the audience 
[03:37:00]  when i saw it when i first saw the trailer i was like this is going to make a fortune yeah you  just know that every kid is going to be dragged to this formula right oh yeah for especially for  i mean i don't know how it works on little boys but little girls dogs and then the dogs  peanut butter and it's a cute little dog oven mitts  yeah oh uncle paul 
[03:37:30]  why do we always have to get despicable you can't just have a conversation without it involving some  kind of child abuse or because when someone says i don't know how it works on little boys  okay anybody funny goes to that where are we gonna go you want to hear oh what's up biden saying  well you know let's see if biden's gonna mess up again today how did he mess up the other day what  did he say a whole lot of terrorist things about obama will be tested yeah he said obama will be  tested early on and at some point yeah yeah it was kind of like panicky and it's messed up obama 
[03:38:00]  it's a now closer race because and now there are two weeks left and our goal is uh is the biggest  voter turnout in north carolina history that's what we're shooting for yeah yeah he looks like every  boy's dean at a school that is just a nasty motherfucker that turnout as you all what is  the wait what was the um election day so he says that obama will be tested yeah how does that 
[03:38:30]  adversely affect it got people campaign it got people kind of angry like um like he was saying  if if we're elected yeah uh here is this guy that they've been arguing is inexperienced and he's saying  that he's going to be most likely militarily tested uh in his uh as he's in office and it kind of made  people kind of panic like hey don't we want the guy that's kind of more experienced yeah it's kind of 
[03:39:00]  like some people put it together in their heads with like yeah we elect obama we're gonna face  another yeah terrorist attack or some kind of yeah it helped mccain big time yeah but then mccain had  that fucking do you have that come on please please e-rock where is it you got to hear this  this fucking clip of mccain is so is the best thing ever i got it i got it do we have both clips where  the first guy talking about i'm totally there oh this is i just called him kev classic oh that's 
[03:39:30]  fine that's fine let's call me i call him kes smith don't call me late what would you call  first supper yeah kevin you can have his well you can call him ray  we still have that bit waiting to go the novelty bit uh but we got this uh representative mirtha okay uh  saying that western pennsylvania is a racist area and uh yes and and this person was talking on  obama's behalf more yes yes yes just to set it up right yeah all right here's the original clip 
[03:40:00]  question western pennsylvania is a racist area and when i say a racist area i mean they  older older people are hesitant you know they slow and uh uh seeing change real real change so so mccain  here's you know that mccain's people here there was a little bit of outrage at that at a whole half  of the state you know the western half of the state being called racist who was speaking on behalf of  the whole half of the state this uh murtha uh character i don't even know how this person is tied 
[03:40:30]  into larry murtha obama who is that i don't know no ted i thought it was ted larry the plumber  but uh yeah he has something to do with whose campaign obama it was associated yeah this made obama look  pretty bad it was associated to just saying like well you know the people are racist if they're not  if they're not pretty much if they're they're not going to be voting for obama because they're  racist okay that's what this guy's saying so mccain gets a listen he's like i got gold i can't wait 
[03:41:00]  to get on tv and and on tv he was there he was there now amongst these people that were just called  racists right and he's gonna wow this crowd by calling out this motherfucker right uh and and and  telling them you know what he thinks and damaging obama in the process yeah this is how it came out  senator obama supporters have been saying some pretty nasty things about western pennsylvania lately  and you know i couldn't agree with him more 
[03:41:30]  get out of here a little gaffe um but perhaps perhaps he can recover from that yeah there's  more oh strap in it ain't over yes but oh christ kevin we dissected this clip because  i love it you see them all like happy like here i go the way he says it he's like well you know  some people have said he's raring to go on this one i'll handle this he's winking to step aside i i 
[03:42:00]  got it it was a very like those fat cats in washington he's winking at his people like watch what i do  with this clear the field some men are gonna make a speech i went all the way back but we'll  oh please go back a thousand times play through he pointed at the fence like babe ruth oh yeah here  it goes and then fouled the ball off his prostate  oh fucking blithering idiot get a load of how he recovers but just listen for the confidence 
[03:42:30]  that's that's what we love about this as he's uh getting ready to rock senator obama supporters have  been saying some pretty nasty things about western pennsylvania lately  and you know i couldn't agree with them more  i couldn't disagree with you i couldn't agree with you more than the fact that western pennsylvania is the  most patriotic 
[03:43:00]  why not just be real in that moment  that's exactly what he said i'm sorry that was a huge blunder  what i meant to say was the exact opposite  but it's no i what i meant is i couldn't disagree with you more  i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna  ha ha ha chef of the future  ednaught oh my god he  fucked that up so bad and then his recovery is wait no i disagree with you  wait i agree with the fact that after the  if you say fact it's all patriotic 
[03:43:30]  tell me tell me please tell me what to agree with  somebody please not like i gotta hear it again and then for the first  entirety you hear the whole crowd basically  huh there's a real like laughing they're like  what it was that's like that sounds like a scene from a movie  where he's just like you know senator obama has been saying some pretty nasty  things about western pennsylvania like boo yeah and he's like and i  couldn't agree with him more i am abdicating i'm leaving this race  i believe you're all racists and senator obama will be your president 
[03:44:00]  he couldn't have sounded dumber if he said representative mike hunt  that's what he said i got an email today from philip mccrack and i even cut your  cock off and say these things hey would you blow me right what a  blithering dolt oh let's one more time he didn't give up any info in nom he  couldn't fucking remember it he couldn't get it out my men they're  stationed in guam wrong  look at biden's face did you guys um did you guys 
[03:44:30]  watch the recent chris rock special kill the messenger  he killed man he but he doesn't really i i wasn't he i loved it that  impressed with it i i liked it because it's chris rock and i think chris rock is  really funny but i fucking gauge everything on that goddamn  bring the pain and there's a lot of stuff i think he was trying to  you know get that back i thought that excitement from that  fucking job i thought like his bush material was the best bush material yeah i  i mean years he he was funny and all it's just i don't know there was 
[03:45:00]  something that bothered me about it and it was distracting the the cutting  between yeah i thought he handled it pretty well  weird the uh but he did a bit god what was his bit well he was talking about  john mccain he's going we all know his record he's a war hero  he's going i want to vote for the guy who did not get caught  poor mccain laying there in that bed smiling in that interview oh you want this one last 
[03:45:30]  i just can't yeah i gotta have it one more time i can't stop looking at joe biden and his  fucking boo radley haircut his hair is fucking horrendous who radley really is  is like a fucking duval wig  oh the dow wrong screen center obama supporters have been saying some pretty nasty things about  western pennsylvania lately lately lately  and you know i couldn't agree with them more i couldn't disagree with you i couldn't agree with

[03:46:30]  like his best friend with a chair  fucking hits you yeah that's a that's beautiful fear yeah vince mcmahon should hire him for the  wwe in the back of the head with the chair and that's that's the yeah that's the only other option  dude it's obama or him i'd much rather have obama at least obama is a good public speaker yeah well  you know something yeah i i know of another public speaker who uh got the crowd uh uh in a frenzy and 
[03:47:00]  a cult of personality and uh perhaps it was in a beer house and why couldn't he be running so i  could vote for him damn it he wouldn't be very fond of you either you're not number one on the list  no i know but i'm down far enough yeah it's true i think no not really you're a  fucking mussolini's people yeah you're a fucking greaseball shitheap in his mind  i don't know how you say it in german i'm sure it sounds nice right i'm sure it sounds like you

[03:55:30]  word by the balls you were john mcclain in like three movies four movies yeah everyone loves you  and you have a massive hog yeah like on top of all that it's not fair man it's not fair to have all  that going for you that's his cock in the color of night well whose head is that next to it but  it's peeking up behind something what's his cock peeking up behind he's doing they did this weird  like underwater love scene it was very strange yeah it's just dangling it looks like her and the  cock are doing like a fucking uh like a nat king call a natalie called duet the way they're looking 
[03:56:00]  at each other no it looks like a scene from mac and me things look like the et knockoff where she's  trying to communicate with a little alien underwater things look bigger underwater it looks like the  poster for a movie about a a girl and an alien because she's looking at it and it's looking back at  her definitely that should have been the poster for contacts absolutely she said should i take you to  my leader and he shot her in the eye oh that fucking guy she was big hog and then she put the 
[03:56:30]  alien in her mouth and started an intergalactic incident because that's a sign of great disrespected  war you suck an entire alien you've consumed our world yes and you're now gonna shoot in your mouth  and what they really do is they carry radio activity in their two little saddlebags  and they poison humanity so we all die oh well kevin we're here all week if you want to stop by 
[03:57:00]  before you go back to l.a uh i know tomorrow morning i have a good day new york appearance  look at you but conceivably i could get up early in the morning it's much funner of course to be on  this half we should come over here come over here yeah afterwards yeah  i would totally do that if they don't have me doing something else you're not on uh wb 11 are  you i don't think i'm doing any i'm not doing any other radio here i mean uh this is the channel 11  it's been a while entertainment is the channel 11 a wb station here yeah yeah used to be p-i-x 
[03:57:30]  when i was a kid picks picks picks picks with the game the video game you gotta play picks picks picks  who they seem to only like call up retards to play that game i'd sit there watching what the  fuck is this kid doing there were kids that would literally try to target yeah and then the smart  kids every once in a while a smart kid would come on and just go picks picks picks picks constantly  shooting yeah picks picks no you dummy just yell it yeah what happened there was a video game 
[03:58:00]  video game that they had that was kind of like this game where a cylon raider looking ship would go  through a targeting site and you were trying to hit it if you had the control you know it was a  targeting game but they played it on air over the phone yeah so you would be watching it on your  screen and you'd be on the phone and you'd say picks and someone on the other side would press  the fire button oh so there's always going to be a slight delay regardless i always thought it was  sound activated some type of time but the second you started describing it i'm like wait a minute was
