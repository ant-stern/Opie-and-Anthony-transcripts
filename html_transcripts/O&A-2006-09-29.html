<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a fiery on-air feud with JV and Elvis from their sister show on WFNY.  The conflict stems from Opie and Anthony running their show late due to Anthony’s emotional distress over his girlfriend's involuntary psychiatric commitment. The argument escalates into a shouting match across both WFNY and XM, involving accusations of dishonesty, stolen comedic tour ideas, and personal attacks on each other’s talent and radio success, referencing Howard Stern’s departure.  The hosts repeatedly promote their uncensored version of the argument on opiananthony.com, highlighting their high ratings despite the station's overall poor performance and their past struggles to remain on the air. Humorous moments include Anthony revealing he was naked and shampooing during the argument, Opie's self-deprecating boast of being a "multi-millionaire board op," and Jim Norton's furious phone commentary from Pittsburgh.  The show also features a "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest with a contestant's herniated belly button causing Bob Kelly to vomit, and listener-submitted audio entries for a MacBook contest.

The MacBook contest continues throughout the show, with one entry—a LARPing skit by “Adam R.”—receiving high praise and consideration as a show promo.  The hosts discuss James McGreevey's appearance on Letterman, specifically a Top 10 list read by another "James McGreevey," followed by a news story about a naked burglar chasing horses in Texarkana, Arkansas.  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss join the studio to promote their shows, leading to discussions of Kelly's sex tape experiences, including detailed accounts of a tape made with his roommate's girlfriend.  They also discuss their campaign for Jerry Springer on *Dancing with the Stars*, playing audio demonstrating the impact of their listeners’ votes, and Dustin Diamond’s sex tape, along with a listener's story about a heart attack triggered by a sex tape.  The MacBook contest and its rules are revisited throughout this segment.

A segment features Rich Voss’s eBay misadventures and stories of buying cars and getting banned from the platform.  The hosts then reminisce about a disastrous appearance by "Steve the Whistler," detailing how they sabotaged his performance, prompting Jimmy to leave and Anthony to hide.  The discussion turns to Dustin Diamond’s alleged sex tape, provoking crude jokes and speculation about its content and a possible celebrity "Poke Em" game involving sex tapes.  Ben Mesrick, author of *Bringing Down the House* and *Busting Vegas*, calls in to discuss card counting, detailing the methods, risks, and run-ins with casinos and authorities, interspersed with vulgar asides from the hosts. Dane Cook calls, and the conversation shifts to his career, upcoming SNL appearance, and movie premiere, along with jokes about his apartment and appliances and his popularity on MySpace and YouTube.  The segment concludes with a return to Ben Mesrick's card-counting strategies and anecdotes, followed by the hosts promoting their show and products with more off-color jokes before a "walkover" segment.


The "walkover" segment begins with the hosts observing a man doing a poor burnout in a luxury car, prompting crude comments.  They encounter a light rain, comment on passersby, including a celebrity look-alike and their former therapist, Carl, who appears with his dogs.  The discussion moves to various celebrities, including Dane Cook, the Beastie Boys, and Rod Stewart, and banter about Carl's appearance and a tie Bob bought him.  An "Invisible Window" bit leads to more crude language. The hosts discuss a pungent fart Rich Voss released in an elevator, followed by highly inappropriate sexual innuendo about food and the studio's unsanitary history. They then address criticism from Jagger, JV, and Elvis, fan sites, and listeners, focusing on low ratings, perceived arrogance, and Anthony’s appearance.  Multiple listener calls follow, escalating the crude humor.  A call from Suzanne in London features graphic details about her sex life, leading to further sexually explicit conversation.  A call from Jagger clarifies misunderstandings from the previous day's show and addresses accusations of a "gag order," ending with mutual jabs.

The show addresses listener feedback and perceived arrogance.  A heated exchange with a caller, Tom, ensues, filled with insults and personal attacks.  Another caller apologizes for Tom on behalf of Oklahoma, leading to a humorous ban on Oklahoma callers.  Further criticism of the previous show's content is addressed.  Rich Vos’s joke about an author's size is discussed.  The majority of the segment features an in-studio interview with R. Lee Ermey ("Gunny"), who discusses his career in the Marine Corps and acting, including anecdotes from *Full Metal Jacket* and *Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning*.  He shares graphic details, expresses strong opinions on politics, the Iraq War, and illegal immigration, and describes a large ring gifted by his wife.  The hosts and Ermey engage in banter, with jokes about Ermey's swearing and vomiting.  The show concludes with promotion of projects and more banter and insults.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[00:00:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model!  Anthony.  I'm dead!  James Norton.  I like yogurt!  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  I'd play some sounds, but I don't have my templates. 
[00:01:30]  They're not out.  Who's responsible for my templates?  I don't know.  Steve's off.  Jim Norton's at the Improv in Pittsburgh all weekend long.  Steve's not here?  Oh, they were under my papers.  Secret Agent Man's not here today.  No.  Everyone has been displaced this week.  Did you get your blueberries?  No blueberries today.  Thanks, Keith.  Oh, Keith failed in his blueberry mission?  Yeah, Keith the cop is taking over for the Secret Agent Man today, and he failed miserably.  You have one job to take care of G.H., and you failed. 
[00:02:00]  No blueberries, no Band-Aid for my wound on my hand.  Wound?  Just something I've been picking at for like six months.  Correct.  Started as a little, I don't know, I banged my hand on a door or something, you know, got  a little cut, and then just proceeded to pick, pick, pick, pick, picking at it.  I keep just picking at it, and Stupid Club Soda Kenny is the only one in this whole organization 
[00:02:30]  that noticed that I have a problem with scabs and picking them.  He would notice, because he probably does the same thing.  So he finally started bringing in Band-Aids every day.  Not at your suggestion.  No, and I would just take the Band-Aid, put it on, so I wouldn't pick, pick, pick, pick,  pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.  That's Kenny.  I once picked a zit on my face until I made a hole in my cheek.  Like Poltergeist, the guy looking in the mirror, peeling his face off.  Then when I finally just stopped picking the thing, it took three months to go away. 
[00:03:00]  It was so infected.  No scar, though.  I'm lucky.  Lucky.  By the way, this pimple occurred when I was 29 years old, when I was in Buffalo.  That's always nice.  Yeah.  No, I don't want any blueberries.  They're out of season anyway.  No, I haven't called the season.  Oh, no.  It's coming soon, though.  No.  Are you the official one that calls the season?  I call blueberry season.  It's getting close.  The price has gone way, way, way, way, way up because they have to ship them in from 
[00:03:30]  God knows where to keep them fresh.  I bet that's a lie.  Bill from Waterford.  Hey, guys.  Are there any plans to change the name of the show to The Bored Op, Funny Man, and Guy  with Insane Girlfriend Show?  Rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?  Oh, let's say hi to Andrew in California.  Hey, guys.  I just want to congratulate you on yesterday's show.  That was the most amazing broadcast I've ever heard in my life. 
[00:04:00]  The only thing that could top it is nuclear war.  Well, that's coming, too.  Trust me.  It was a wonderful program.  Yeah, thank you.  Shockful of surprises, stories, things.  Who saw them coming?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Actually, we all saw it coming.  It was all just that underlying tension that had been there the whole time, but that just  exploded yesterday with JV and Elvis.  I really believe this is the only radio show in America where you've got to listen every 
[00:04:30]  day to the entire show.  Yeah.  Because at any given moment, this whole thing could just explode.  It's like a soap opera.  We're either going to blow ourselves up.  We've done that, though, before.  I mean, at any moment, something crazy could happen on this program because it's a real  radio show.  With real people.  We're trying to pull out the radio voice and do things like a typical hack radio.  It's pretty much just us throwing it out there. 
[00:05:00]  People seem to enjoy that.  Well, where do we begin?  Oh, my God.  Yesterday's show was just amazing, and I'm not going to explain it to the newbies out there.  You really just got to get hooked.  You really missed out.  We call it the ONA virus for a reason.  Get hooked so we don't have to explain things over and over again.  But Anthony had a situation.  A situation.  A personal situation.  It was remedied yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, girlfriend is back home.  Oh, yeah, she's actually here today.  She's here today, but I mean, she's back home.  Spending the weekend in the city.  Very nice.  Going out.  I want to see Lynch's play.  Who can get me tickets?  Wedding singer?  Yeah.  That's easy.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't make it sound like it's easy to get.  Why?  Because he's our friend.  You don't want to go, oh, you just walk in.  The seats are empty.  You sit down.  They don't even know.  No, no, no.  This is the deal.  It's selling out like crazy, but there's a block of tickets that they just keep for friends and family. 
[00:06:00]  It's one phone call.  It's easy.  Good.  We'll do that in between the two shows, okay?  Good.  So, Anthony just spilled his guts yesterday.  It got very personal, very emotional, very compelling.  And thank God it had a really good ending by the end of the show.  So, we decided, stupid us, that the radio was so damn good yesterday that we needed to go a little later on this station here in New York and on our stations across America. 
[00:06:30]  I don't even know who kept going with the show.  So, I'm sure a bunch of dummies out there decide, ah, we'll go to our classic rock now.  We've heard enough.  I didn't even think about that.  Yeah, the affiliates.  We just threw the word out.  We're like, look, we're going late today.  You know, if you want to continue, do so.  If not, then play your stupid twofers or your block party weekend sweepers or your five o'clock funnies, whatever the crap you do to fill time until we're back on the radio. 
[00:07:00]  So, we did an extra half hour, and then we did the walk over to XM, and then we did our XM show.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  We do two radio shows every day.  I think most people understand that at this point.  I think it's been written about.  So, then we're over at XM thinking, wow, man, that was a crazy morning, three and a half hours, a man spilling his guts, and just, you know, everyone's on the edge of their seats wondering what the hell's going to happen.  And it sounded like he was going insane. 
[00:07:30]  He sounded like he was going to.  Frustration.  He was going to go to the hospital and do some kind of breakout to get her out.  I thought it was going to end with your arrest.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm not even kidding.  It could have.  So, then we're doing our XM show, and we get word that JV and Elvis, who follow us here in New York, are trashing us because we went late.  Yeah.  And my whole point to that was, if you don't get why we went late yesterday and it was one of those things, then you just don't belong in radio. 
[00:08:00]  Don't understand radio.  You don't belong in radio is some of the most compelling stuff you'll ever hear from a radio show, which forced us to go late because we had commercials backed up.  We had guests backed up.  You know, and their point was, well, they could have interviewed Pedro over at their XM show.  No, we couldn't.  He's a very busy man.  He's a Hollywood actor with publicists around him, and he was here.  We had to get the job done.  We promised an interview with Pedro. 
[00:08:30]  Nice enough to sit around, too, for a while before we talked to him.  So then they took some lame stabs at us saying, oh, that was worth going late.  That interview was compelling.  Really great interview.  So we got him on the phone, and we beat the crap out of him, and we beat the crap out of him really bad.  Yep.  But these pussies, they used these old hack radio tricks that people with no set on them use in order to make it sound like you're getting the upper hand, one of which is turning down the volume of whoever you're arguing with. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, we got him on the phone on our XM show.  Here's the beauty of what I'm about to say.  So we're going at it, you know, the free FM here in New York is here in their version, and the XMers out there are here in our version.  Our version was allowing them to be as loud as us.  Yeah.  It was just an all-out shouting match.  Right.  Which I completely won, by the way. 
[00:09:30]  It's obvious to everybody.  But if you were listening to the free FM station here in New York City, we were so low in the background, it wasn't even funny.  Yeah, they turn it way down.  That's how brave these asses are.  Yeah.  They're a bunch of hacks.  Really brave.  And that situation will take care of itself.  They're a bunch of hacks.  So the Daily News wrote about it.  Wrote about it?  Oh, by the way, to the people that did not hear the argument.  Yeah.  It's up on opiananthony.com, our version. 
[00:10:00]  Our version.  Yeah, the one where you hear both sides.  Where you hear both sides.  Because I'm not scared of anybody.  You want to fight?  Then we fight.  I'm not going to play little radio games and turn you down in the volume and stuff.  So, you know, we can't hear what you're trying to say.  And here's another old hack radio trick.  When somebody says something that makes you look like an ass, you hit the dump button.  Right.  And dump it out and say, hey, don't curse.  Hey.  Meanwhile, no cursing was done.  Yeah.  And we have our side of the story where Jim Norton, at one point, laid into them so badly that there was nothing they could do. 
[00:10:30]  They were, like, on the canvas.  Jimmy, you know how Jim could just unload on somebody.  Not one curse.  And they kept dumping out.  Not only did they dump out.  Hey, hey, hey.  You dropped the F-bomb.  These guys are dropping the F-bomb.  Jimmy never dropped the F-bomb.  No, because we knew we were on radio and we wanted to be heard.  So there was a couple curses that flew within the exchange, yes.  But at that moment, no.  No. 
[00:11:00]  And all of a sudden, you hear, hey, hey, you can't curse.  I got to dump you.  It's a curse.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, all right.  You're dumb.  You didn't like what we just said, right?  Right.  A little too close to home.  And then they're trying to claim that the only reason they have bad ratings is because they're in middays.  And I'm like, well, then why aren't you trying to get a morning show out there?  Why aren't you trying to get an afternoon drive show out there?  Because those are the two key slots that DJs want to be in.  You're so scary talented.  What are you doing sitting in middays?  Right.  Complaining.  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old. 
[00:11:30]  When I didn't like my position in radio, I didn't sit there and take it from management.  I went and got a better job.  That's what you do.  That's what you do.  You don't sit there and go, well, if they threw us in mornings or afternoons, we would have unbelievable ratings.  Would you?  That's a big F.  You're in middays rotting.  You're in middays rotting.  And you're doing nothing about it.  And then they're bitching about it.  You had a great opportunity when David Lee Roth stunk up the joint. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And if you were doing any type of show with any type of ratings, they would have moved you into that slot.  You'd be sitting here right now.  They didn't want to hire us.  They were forced to.  You'd be sitting here right now.  Believe me, they didn't want us back.  You think CBS radio wanted to hire us?  They were forced to.  They want to drag us back.  Do you think there's this loving relationship between XM and CBS also that they could just, you know, make a deal and shake hands and smile at each other?  Was that easy?  No.  This was a bitch of a deal to get through. 
[00:12:30]  And if there was any inkling of talent in the organization already, they would be sitting here.  Yeah, because it would have been a lot easier.  They did not want to rehire us.  The lawyers, it's in the press.  The lawyers down in Washington said, don't hire them.  They said, do not hire Opie and Anthony.  And management said, we don't have a choice.  We don't have a choice.  Jesus Christ, we don't have a choice.  We either hire them or we're going to be fired.  We have to do this.  So where was scary, talented JV and Elvis during that whole time? 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Where were they?  Right.  And you want to bitch about 9 o'clock that we're doing it?  By the way, I think that was the one time we ran over and they can't take it.  It was the one time officially we ran over.  We ran over a couple other times, but it was sponsored.  It was a big money-making thing for the company.  So we said, sure, we'll do an extra half hour.  But that was out of our hands.  That was told to us by management.  We could make a lot of money if you guys go an extra half hour.  9 o'clock, sorry. 
[00:13:30]  We'd love for something to work out where we could actually be heard on terrestrial radio until 10.  Because we don't like the idea that a quarter of our ratings are based on what they're doing, is averaged in.  Because when you look at the ratings, you're looking at from 6 to 10.  That's what everyone looks at, from 6 to 10.  We work here from 6 to 9.  That last hour, we have to rely on JV and Elvis' numbers to be averaged into our three hours.  And by the way, they bitched on how they can't get numbers in middays when you break down the 9 to 10 o'clock hour, which is part of the fine morning drive slot. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  They stink.  I know.  Yeah, that's morning drive.  You're doing an hour of morning drive radio.  And stinking it up.  And trust me, you're not helping us whatsoever.  Yeah.  Don't do us any favors, please.  And then they're doing just a bunch of hack stuff, like bringing Howard's name into it and stuff.  It's like another freaking show that thinks Howard's going to rescue them. 
[00:14:30]  Go to Sirius, then.  Yeah, go to Sirius.  Go end up over there.  Go bow to the king, kiss his ass.  Go ahead and go.  And grab your $29,000 a year that he might give you.  And do a commercial for him for your entire show, like everyone else that he brings over does.  I take pride in the fact that we never had to kiss Howard's ass.  Yeah.  We've never brought Howard into an argument when we've had a battle with somebody.  No.  Howard did. 
[00:15:00]  Go work with Howard, then.  We're doing our own thing.  And their argument was hysterical.  What was that?  Rich brought it up earlier.  It was really.  They go.  Jackasses.  Well, Howard left you all the listeners.  Well, Howard.  Yeah.  Well, you just got the seat because Howard left.  Well, they got to put someone here.  They didn't sit there with their radios going.  And by the way, they put David Lee Roth here.  And that didn't work.  Right.  And then they put us here and we're working. 
[00:15:30]  So what's your point?  We took over for the David Lee Roth stations officially.  Yeah.  You know, and we earned it because they're trying to say, oh, look, look what you guys were handed.  No, we weren't handed that.  Handed.  Before we screwed up royally, we were syndicated in the afternoon drive to, what, 1920 stations?  Yeah.  We made our own name in the business, pals.  And we didn't need Howard to do it, jackasses.  When David Lee Roth was plummeting, they were probably sitting there going, oh, boy, this is sweet.  Oh, we're in. 
[00:16:00]  We're in.  Let me tell you, every Vulture show was sitting there crowing about how they're going to take over the slot.  They're in.  They're in.  We're going.  We're doing this.  Well, we've been in talks every show from man dick to all of them.  And we just sat over at XM going, eh, let's see what happens.  And I don't know if Howard's going to allow you to drink on the air.  So you might want to see if that's possible before you accept a job over there. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  By the way, let's go to Tom.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Yo, that was by far the best thing I've ever heard on radio yesterday.  I'm a big fan.  I've been a fan of you guys for years.  I do like JV and Elvis.  I think it's a good show.  I mean, I think that.  Look, I can't even form an opinion because we're too busy doing five to five and a half hours of radio.  The other day, I'm not going to lie to you.  I have no idea what kind of show they do.  I heard they were successful in San Francisco. 
[00:17:00]  I'll tell you this much.  I've been in radio since 18, and I know all the players.  I never heard of JV and Elvis until we started working with them.  I just never heard of them.  I like the fake radio voice.  Because now I'm hearing they claimed in the past that we ripped them off.  And the complete dishonesty.  Is that part of the show you like?  The complete dishonesty?  Every show BS is around.  BSing around is one thing.  And complete dishonesty is another.  Look, how would you guys feel like with that show?  What about the guy from Philly who filled in for him? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know if that has anything to do with you.  Barsky.  Yeah, Barsky's pretty good, actually.  Yeah.  Do you think that that guy's better than they are?  Dude, you've got to be kidding me.  I'm saying Barsky's pretty good.  I have heard Barsky over the years.  Yes.  Well, I thought it was the most horrible show I ever heard on New York radio when that guy was on.  I'll be honest.  All right.  Well, that's...  You guys are by far, you know, one of the best shows out there.  Oh, you don't have to tell us that.  And then they try to claim we stole their comedy show?  What was that about?  Yeah.  I had no idea they ever did a comedy tour or comedy show. 
[00:18:00]  We were the first to do a tour.  Oh, you had your book, Abbott and Costello?  Right.  Yeah.  There was never comedy tours before that, and radios never put together a comedy tour.  I had no clue.  I had no clue what they did with their careers.  I know.  This was an idea we had four or five years ago.  It's not an original idea.  They've been doing comedy tours through radio stations, by the way, for many, many years.  We just took it to the next level.  That's all.  Because no one's going to go see their tour.  What are they going to do?  Sell out, you know...  Do the seller?  Yeah.  They actually said we stole the idea from them. 
[00:18:30]  I'm like, are you...  That's what we do.  Do you honestly think I know the first thing about you guys?  Oh, that's funny.  And then through the argument, one of them had to say that I barely talked to them in the hall.  I don't have time to talk to anyone in the hall.  We leave this show, and someone gives me a wireless mic because we have to continue broadcasting.  We're still doing a show.  Right away.  We're still doing a show.  We're stopping chat.  We've always been cordial in there.  It's always been civil in the hall.  It's not like, hey, F you, F you, you know?  It's like, hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's up?  But I always felt an underlying thing. 
[00:19:00]  They had a problem with us.  It's like, look, man, you should have a problem with management.  They didn't believe in you.  We have nothing to do with this.  If they believed in you, you'd be in afternoon drive or morning drive.  Right.  They don't believe in you.  The writing's on the wall.  So you, as a radio show and as an air personality, go find a better job.  That's what I did.  That's what I did time and time again.  I didn't sit there and wait for management to finally realize that maybe I have something  to offer in radio. 
[00:19:30]  I went out and searched it out myself.  See, CBS taking you guys back, you're saying, you know, I mean, that's like taking your old  girlfriend back that had slept with the whole cow and you're going, all right, I'll take  her back.  You know what I mean?  It's the hardest thing that they had to do was take us back.  The most difficult show to get on the air for CBS was the Opie and Anthony show.  It was so difficult to do, but that's what they felt they had to do to be successful in 
[00:20:00]  mornings.  And they've never done this before.  You're still on another radio show.  It's ridiculous what they had to go through.  It's retarded that you're on satellite and free.  But that was a block that was easier than taking JV and Elvis and putting them in morning.  Have you walk a block and a half every day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And walk a block and a half and wire us for sound like the FBI.  We're frigging wired for sound walking down the streets in New York.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:20:30]  JV and Elvis don't know that Pereno was ahead of them.  It's a spot.  Wow.  Thank you, Rich Voss.  Anyway, the Daily News, the headline, a nasty case of air rage at Free FM, a surreal story  that began when WFNY morning co-host Anthony Cumia's girlfriend was involuntarily committed  to a psychiatric hospital.  Cuckoo.  Led yesterday to Anthony and his partner Opie exchanging a torrent of loud insults on the  air with the Free FM team that follows them, JV and Elvis.  The volume of this exchange and the fact it involved hosts from the same station made it sound 
[00:21:00]  unusually intense.  JV and Elvis said Opie and Anthony aren't as successful as Howard Stern and that while  Anthony is funny, Opie is just a board operator.  Go work for Howard then, man.  You'll love the guy.  Everyone thinks that that's what's going to get to us.  They reach for the Howard.  We have more listeners than he does.  What the hell do we care about Howard?  You know, they're hoping that Howard heard this and all of a sudden Howard's calling up,  hey, all of a sudden he's calling and giving them, you know, a great gig over at that crap hole. 
[00:21:30]  Sorry.  I don't think he's got your number, especially out at the Hamptons house.  Hoo-hoo.  He doesn't even know you exist, so keep trying, though.  Try like, I don't know, maybe flying banners or something.  Yeah.  Play it over the beach over there.  You don't sound too desperate by using Howard's name in an argument.  These are the guys that come in.  If you could work your way into a polo match out in the Hamptons, perhaps he'd recognize you or know you.  Opie replied, yeah, a board op who's on the side of buses and David Letterman's couch. 
[00:22:00]  A board op who's a multi.  Yeah, this was funny when he said this one.  God damn it.  I'm going to have to send my freaking family more checks.  Boss keeps pointing to him as his own chest like he said it, not you, Opie.  I did, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, when he was yelling, he was calling, Opie, a board op.  I started screaming, going, yeah, well, he's on every bus and the garden, okay?  Yeah.  And then Opie goes, and Letterman.  It's like, how do you like that?  You know, because my aunt and I, we had our faces on the side of Madison Square Garden. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Beat that.  No one's going to beat that.  Yeah.  That doesn't happen every day.  And it was the whole garden.  It was us and Mark Messier.  Beat that.  Beat that.  All right.  So anyway, Opie replied, yeah, board op who's on the side of buses and David Letterman's  couch, a board op who's a multi-millionaire.  What do you think of that?  Great.  My family's going to be calling for checks.  That's it.  Oh, yeah, we're now.  Multi? 
[00:23:00]  Did you say multi?  You told me you were making $100,000 a year.  Ooh.  Opie said nobody listens to JV and Elvis and that if they were any good, they'd have gotten  the WFNY morning show when David Lee Roth was fired.  Mark Chernoff, Vice President of Programming for WFNY, said after the exchange, it's just  radio.  I hope people remember that all hosts, Stern and Imus, have these kinds of exchanges.  That's not what he really said.  He said good impression.  It's stupid.  It's safe.  It's like the safest thing Mark Chernoff could say. 
[00:23:30]  He's got to keep everybody happy.  Everyone's happy.  That's his job.  His job is like Thanksgiving dinner where he knows that portions of the family are over  that are going to argue and fight.  Right.  But come on, let's keep it all nice.  No.  And then his quote ends with, I love all my hosts.  Ugh.  Oh, he didn't say that.  Ugh.  Tell me he didn't say that.  Ugh.  What he really said is, who's JV and Elvis?  The drama began with Anthony talking about how his girlfriend was committed and how he 
[00:24:00]  was working to spring her.  Spring.  Opie and Anthony host 6 to 9 a.m. on WFNY.  Simulcast with XM.  Then 9 to 11 on XM alone.  It sounds complicated even when you read it, what we do every day.  But Chernoff said, Kumi, his story was compelling enough for them to stay on WFNY until 9.30.  JV and Elvis, who do 9 to 1, grumbled about losing the time.  One called in from XM and the discussion quickly escalated to schoolyard style yelling. 
[00:24:30]  Schoolyard style.  And at that point, they turned down our volume because they're a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  We kept them up in the mix the entire time.  Our version is up on opianthony.com.  Oh, you'll hear the, yeah, the XM feed, which has where we weren't cursing and they were  saying, you could hear them actually saying, hey, hey, don't curse.  Don't curse.  Hey, we had to dump out of that.  You could hear it.  Oh, what?  There's Mark Chernoff. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, Mark is.  With a fake gun to his head.  Making the gun to his head gesture.  Say hi to Imus for us, will you?  A schoolyard style yelling.  Opie also said WFNY's parents, CBS, wants me and Anthony to do the 9 to 10 hour, which  is true.  But who would that?  That's kind of like obvious.  But now all the XMers are scared.  XM is pretty much not going to allow that.  I don't think they're going to allow that anytime soon.  I got to like calm them down because the email just went nuts. 
[00:25:30]  Mark Logan is getting emails from pests like crazy.  Well, now we have to do six hours of radio, I think, to keep everyone happy.  Which we just might do.  You never know.  Something like that.  It's going to be a regular eight hour job, 40 hours a week.  You're going to do it from cubicles.  That's it.  Let's see.  Elvis said later that when the call ended, he and JV were told to stop on air discussion  of it.  They were told to stop and like good little boys, they stopped.  That's why you're still doing middays, by the way. 
[00:26:00]  That's why you're still doing middays.  And I never listened to management.  For the time being, they are.  Who knows what the future will bring.  Ant and I never listened.  Who knows?  We kept things going to the point where we blew up our own careers.  And we'll do it again.  That's right.  We don't care.  WFNY is the lowest rated major FM station in New York, though O&A are in the top ten among  their target 18 to 34 year olds.  Of course.  This gets us attention, said Mark Chernoff. 
[00:26:30]  Attention is good as long as no one gets hurt.  Oh no.  Stop it.  Where is he?  Did he say that too?  Oh my God.  As long as no one hurts, gets hurt.  As long as no one gets hurt.  Those microphones could put an eye out.  Well, he did threaten Norton, JV.  Come on, say it to my face.  Oh yeah, because it always turns into, all these guys, anybody that decides they have  a problem with this show, always starts with the fight thing.  They want to fight. 
[00:27:00]  Do you want to brawl?  What do you want to do?  What?  I say bring it on.  I say bring it on.  I don't give a crap.  Oh yeah.  I really don't.  Ready to go.  I talked to Bobby last night.  He goes, oh man, maybe we could scrap tomorrow.  Are you ready to scrap?  Yeah, I don't really care.  I don't really care.  Bobby wouldn't mind.  Right after this.  Huh?  Yeah.  Right after this show, today, those guys are the ones that come out.  I really don't care.  I mean, you know.  Please.  I'm going to stretch in between breaks.  What, Mark?  Stretch Mark?  I'm not popping a hamstring.  Please, I don't care. 
[00:27:30]  I'm stupid.  Pop a hammy.  Pop a hammy.  You know what happened last time?  I broke my knee, man.  Yeah, that's all we need.  Great.  That's our guy.  I broke my knee, man.  I'm just getting kicked in the stomach.  You guys will walk out and do the walkover.  Oh, my hand.  So there you go for the most part.  Yeah.  Our version is up on opandanthia.com.  It's very, very good.  It's like 70 minutes long.  It is very, very good.  I have never seen Norton that bad in my life. 
[00:28:00]  Norton was livid.  He was out of it.  I mean, screaming.  And he was, you know, especially when the guy said, hey, don't curse.  You know what I mean?  It's like you being accused of something you didn't do, you know?  Because I think that was at the point where he kept yelling, like, why are you still in middays?  Why are you still in middays?  Why are you still in middays?  Like, he wouldn't let it go until he got an answer.  And they kept dumping, saying that he was cursing.  And he's like, I'm not cursing.  Oh, was he.  He was pissed.  And one thing I'm a little upset didn't make the paper, but made the radio trade websites 
[00:28:30]  and blogs and everything was how, do we have the actual quote here?  I liked it from yesterday's blogs.  The part that they left out.  What?  One of the most important parts, where I was during the whole exchange.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was nude shampooing in my shower.  They actually added that to the story yesterday.  Thank God the, what was it, the Daily News it was in today? 
[00:29:00]  Thank God they decided to leave that out.  I had to leave early.  Yeah.  So I was home in the shower with my cell phone on speaker.  Yeah.  Shampooing my hair, listening to this whole thing, trying to get a word in edgewise.  But my phone was gating out.  Anthony's showering the nude as the board op, you know, continued for another hour and a half  by himself with little Jimmy Norton.  Actually, it was me and Jimmy.  I shouldn't say by myself.  It was, yeah, you guys just killed.  And there's no way to get in on Opie on that one, on those type of situations. 
[00:29:30]  It really says it.  Why?  Oh, great.  Hold on.  Here, give me the whole story.  We got to take a break, but give me the whole story.  Thank you.  Another article on this.  Opie and Anthony, JV and Elvis battle in on-air argument.  The tension between O&A and the show that follows them on CBS erupted into an on-air argument  Thursday when O&A's show ran 20 minutes long and middayers JV and Elvis complained.  This is really hard to read.  I'm sorry. 
[00:30:00]  Complain.  I'm reading off a really bad computer screen.  Complain on the air about the delay of the start of the show.  O&A's show stayed on the air late because of the continuing battle between Anthony Cumia  and officials at a hospital over an incident in which Anthony's girlfriend was involuntarily  committed after being taken to the hospital ill and in an intoxicated state by an alarmed  Anthony.  Where's my drunk kooky girl?  Anthony's telephone argument with a hospital representative kept the show on the air past  the usual 9 a.m. crossover to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:30:30]  Meanwhile, JV and Elvis complained to FAY management and then on the air about the delay.  After O&A moved over to XM about 9.20 and got wind of JV and Elvis on-air complaints,  they called into JV and Elvis' show to confront the middayers.  I don't give a crap about the schedule.  If we want to go late, we're going late, Opie told JV and Elvis after JV and Elvis claimed  that O&A didn't earn their syndication and said that Howard Stern had earned the stations  with O&A merely the replacements.  That statement right there is so ridiculous. 
[00:31:00]  Insane.  He earned them.  Well, he left.  Then they don't just put anyone in the seat after someone leaves.  Oh, they did.  They'd like to ignore what we've done in radio.  We built up afternoon drive syndication, which, by the way, was never done before in the way  we did it.  We were syndicated to 20 radio stations.  We made a name for ourselves in this business.  There's a prime example.  Throw that out the window like that didn't happen.  It's ridiculous.  Here's a prime example.  David Lee Roth did not earn the right to sit in the morning drive seat that Howard vacated. 
[00:31:30]  He didn't earn it, and look how that worked out.  We, over the years, did earn it.  And that's why we're sitting here.  Thank you very much.  That's right.  That's right.  Replacements.  O&A sidekick Jim Norton responded by asking, why weren't you the replacement?  Why did they stick you in middays?  JV and Elvis said on the air that they were discussing going back to where they had been  successful in the past, an apparent reference to returning to San Francisco.  Bye-bye.  No one will miss you. 
[00:32:00]  Bye-bye.  It'll happen more in the future, Opie said, referring to stay on the air past nine, so  you'll have to deal with it or get another gig.  JV and Elvis continued trashing the morning show, denigrating Opie as a board op.  That is the hackiest thing at this point, to call me a board op.  I mean, the reality is I make a lot of money, and the company could save a crap load of money  if I was truly a board op.  But the reality is I'm a genius, and I get paid to be a genius. 
[00:32:30]  So deal with it.  And your modesty is something to be spoken about.  Yeah, I know.  But, you know, I mean, they're pushing me now.  I've been a humble broadcaster for many, many years, trust me.  But if you want to push me, the reality is I'm a genius, and I get paid very well to  be a radio genius.  How do you like them, Apple?  Nothing better than seeing that divine spark hit Opie, and then he grabs his notebook and  writes something down that you know is going to get us in trouble.  It's like, oh, yeah, exactly. 
[00:33:00]  So if you're going to try to get to me, you're going to have to try a lot harder than the  old board op thing.  And the old, you know, try to divide and conquer.  That is the old thing.  By saying, Anthony is funny, but Opie is this.  It's not going to work.  We've been at this for 12 years.  We're in this for the long haul.  I have effed up his life so many times, and he still comes back to work with me.  How do you like that, Bob Kelly?  Why do I keep coming back?  But I do.  How do you like that?  Broadcasting genius. 
[00:33:30]  If we can't break ourselves up, you're going to be the one that breaks us up, divide and  conquer?  That old gag?  Shut up.  Just because you can't stand who you work with.  JB and Elvis continue trashing the morning show.  I'm getting a timeout from Mark Turnoff.  Relax.  We're almost done.  A timeout?  And talking anti-O&A phone.  What?  It would be easier if you could read.  Oh, and taking anti-O&A phone calls well into the show with Opie and Anthony on the phone  from Opie, Anthony from his home, and Norton listening in and commenting on XM and arguing  with JB and Elvis. 
[00:34:00]  Opie noted that.  You've got to get on mic.  What are you reading?  Norton's screen?  It's really hard to read.  Smeared with goo.  Opie noted that it must burn them up that a board op is doing better than them.  A new midday show coming to Free FM.  Anthony laughed.  Adding that he was nude and shampooing during the whole argument.  Okay.  Adding that he was nude and shampooing, yes, during the whole argument.  It was really hard to read.  Which I absolutely was, but the most disturbing thing, listening to a big argument as I'm  trying to shampoo with one hand because I had the cell phone in the other one in my palatial 
[00:34:30]  shower.  I want to thank them for the excitement and all that crap, but now we move on and you  guys just become an afterthought.  Remain in your obscurity.  We're done with you.  I hope you enjoyed your day in the limelight.  Wasn't it fun?  But that's all you get is a day.  Wasn't it fun being part of this whole excitement of the morning show that is the Opie and Anthony  show?  It must've been fun.  Well, bye-bye.  You get a day in the limelight.  You know, through your bone.  Howard, you know, you got to respect him and that's why we still battle it out with him 
[00:35:00]  all the time.  But you guys, you get a day.  Congratulations.  You got a day out of us.  All right.  We got Rich Voss in studio.  Of course, Jim Norton's at the improv in Pittsburgh all weekend long.  We'll see how that went because a lot of people are on the phones.  They said they saw Jim Norton and the secret agent man last night.  And of course, Bob Kelly in studio as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.

It has nothing to do with, you know, just trying to make it fun for us.  Because this is a grind every day.  Hanging out with people, you know.  Yeah, this is an effing.  Like people do in real life.  Or supposed to, you know.  It's a grind to come up with this stuff every day.  So it's kind of nice to have people around you that make it fun.  Sorry.  Sorry you don't understand that either. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, man.  They have Jackie.  Who is she, anyhow?  Is she a comic?  I don't know.  By the way, I really don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know it.  Hey, YouTube video is going up like crazy.  You've got Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man.  It's getting viewed like crazy.  Couldn't get that out of my head yesterday, but his version.  Like, I sing this song now, and it comes out, you know.  There's a man who lives a life of danger.  I can't get it out of my head the way he sings it, though.  He is a stranger.  Stranger. 
[00:38:00]  Secret Agent Man.  That's the part that gets me.  Agent.  Agent.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Away.  He gets all sexy.  He tries to get all sexy with it.  Away.  See, I brought that home with me.  This show, it's weird.  Like, all of a sudden, something will pop that you want to be reciting at your house. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You can't get it out of your head.  We've been doing, uh, Dad!  Dad!  Dad!  Oh, Jimmy has you down with that one.  Dad!  But it's fun to do at home.  You know, I've never actually heard you say it, but...  Yeah, I don't know if I...  Apparently, it's very funny when Jimmy does it.  Yeah.  Dad!  Dad!  There's just things that happen with this radio show that you want to do around your house  long after the show is off the air.  You know, when I'm doing the tablers... 
[00:39:00]  The tablers...  But the new one is, I say, way!  Way!  Anyway, so we got Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Asian Man on YouTube.  We got intern Craig sucking on Big Rhonda's herniated belly button.  Oh!  And we also have the, uh, video of Bob Kelly puking after he saw the herniated belly button  on Rhonda.  One of the many Bob Kelly, uh, puking videos.  And just for the record, people say I have a weak stomach.  I'm looking at a hernia coming out of a fat chick's belly button.  That's not a weak stomach. 
[00:39:30]  That's a normal stomach.  It was really like an old Star Trek special effect, is what it looked like.  It was like a cheap special effect coming out of her stomach.  It looked like a whale eye.  Do you think that's what people are really saying about your stomach?  That it's weak?  Oh.  That one took a second to sink in.  So does your stomach.  I was like, come on.  I had to actually, I don't like how you looked at my stomach to get me to get it.  It's a sight gag.  You gotta look down.  Remember what we're talking about here? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I have a herniated belly button.  What is that?  What do you mean interesting enough?  She said she tried to lift a bureau.  Yeah.  And, and, uh.  She tried to eat it.  She said eat.  And Norton said, what, the FBI?  That one line of the day, by the way, on that occasion.  She's not the leader.  A bureau.  She's not the leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, but she's our best contestant so far.  Yeah.  The current leader is 430 pounds.  Crystal from Cleveland still leads the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest. 
[00:40:30]  And I think we have a sponsor for that now.  Yeah.  And a new scale.  And a new scale that goes up to 1,000 pounds.  1,000.  Here's the audio.  A shark scale and hook up with a lip.  Yeah, lift her up.  Oh, look at this thing.  Who got her?  Ben Gardner?  There's the scale.  That's pretty impressive.  Here's the audio of Bob Kelly puking after Craig, uh, the intern, sucked on the herniated  belly button of Fat Rhonda.  All right.  Wait, Craig, what's wrong? 
[00:41:00]  He's right.  He's wrong.  Look at it.  This thing is repulsive.  It's a hernia.  What do you expect it to look like?  A f***?  Pam Anderson's f***.  All right.  How many?  You got it?  You got to make it look good and suck on it.  You got to suck on it.  Wait, can I lick it first so I know the teeth?  He needs to get a feel of it.  I'll get your mouth right in.  Yeah, yeah.  You can lick and then go in for the suckle.  Lick and then suckle.  And the suckle has to be...  Very gentle.  ...has to be five seconds.  Go, go, go.  A little very gentle.  Big, long, exaggerated lick.  Watch it, Bobby.  First, I'm going to lick it. 
[00:41:30]  So it's very gentle.  Watch it, Bobby.  You can do it, dude.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  All right.  Don't do it, Bobby.  It tastes like skin.  All right.  It tastes like skin.  It's just skin.  Go for the suck.  Bobby, you don't want to suckle.  Suckle gently.  All right.  I'm sorry.  No, don't.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  No hands, by the way.  That's right.  Here we go.  Here's Craig.  Skin covered s***.  There you have it. 
[00:42:00]  And the video's up on YouTube, of course, for your viewing pleasure.  Can I tell you what made me throw up?  I don't know.  I think it was Opie or Anthony.  I don't know which one of you said it, but you go, it's an intestine.  Food is running through it.  Yeah.  And I picture just under the skin, I could see, like, a broccoli head shooting.  A lima bean.  Yeah.  Just something shooting, like, pulsating through, like, blood.  It just looks like dinty more stew being pushed through a clear tube. 
[00:42:30]  By the way, the scale is sponsored by...  Ah.  They are selling the crap out of this radio show.  Bravo.  Bring it on.  Scale-tronics, T-R-O-N-I-X, from White Plains, New York.  Scale-tronics.  Thank you.  They have a website.  What, do they dress the scales up in lingerie for you to check out?  Why do you need a website for a scale company?  www.scale-tronics.com. 
[00:43:00]  What is that normally used for?  I can't wait to check out that website tonight.  Is that used for overweight people?  Yeah.  Or is it?  Because it's very small.  Yeah.  So it's not like you'd, like, lead a cow onto the thing.  Cars.  Cars, yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ted.  Truck stop.  Ted, what's up?  Edit, Ted.  So, yes.  Just about the fight yesterday.  I think it's ironic, because they also have a problem with the back end, with the radio 
[00:43:30]  truck show, that their show's syndicated in San Francisco, and yet they can't get their  own show syndicated back in their old market.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're moving on from this crap, by the way.  Yeah.  We just, you know, enough.  They've been in the limelight long enough.  If they want to go back there, let them.  If they stay here, who cares?  It doesn't matter.  I could care less.  Well, we do encourage people to check out the audio of the fight on our website, opiananthony.com,  because it's hysterical.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  I yelled, Yakov Smirnoff.  Yakov Smirnoff.  For three minutes straight. 
[00:44:00]  For the comedy tour.  Yakov Smirnoff.  That they wanted to put together.  What was your lineup?  Gallagher?  Gallagher, Yakov Smirnoff.  And Judy Tenuto.  And Judy Tenuto.  I'm like, that's the type of comedian you guys can get.  But to claim that we ripped off the idea from them, you know, I don't even know what  to say to that.  I had no clue you ever even did a comedy show.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I don't know much about you.  I'm sure that really bothers you, by the way.  I know it does, because one of them had to say, oh, he barely even talks to me in the  hall.  I don't even know who you are.  It's because you have a drinking plow. 
[00:44:30]  Just keep hoping for the Howie call.  I'm sure that'll be coming any day now.  Also, Rich Voss doing comedy at that diner in Cleveland is up on YouTube, and a lot of  people are viewing that as well.  So lots of great new videos on YouTube that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony  show.  Yeah.  Oh, he killed at the griddle.  The next day.  The guy with the hair lip.  He was like, that guy was pretty good.  All right.  We've got to take another break.  We've got to catch up.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:45:00]  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Rich Voss in studio.  Bob Kelly in studio.  A lot of excitement and adrenaline.  We love this.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out.  Thank you for supporting us.  Thanks for all the kind messages, by the way, on all the websites yesterday.  Very cool to read through. 
[00:45:30]  I'll tell you, when you read those commercial breaks, it makes me wish that I would have  stayed in school.  You just do it so smoothly without...  You just read great.  I suck at reading.  It's funny.  It's too early to read.  A grown man admires another man for reading great.  Reading.  You read great.  You read great.  Let's go to Georgia.  James, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I love the show.  Been listening for quite a while now.  Cool.  Thanks.  I was wondering what happened with Anthony's girlfriend yesterday.  Nobody said anything. 
[00:46:00]  Ah.  I sprung her.  She's been sprung.  Yeah, but how'd you get it out?  No, I went over to the hospital, and apparently some of the doctors had heard the show.  They heard the show.  And sat down, spoke at them.  They were pretty much in the mindset of they just want to prevent lawsuits.  And that's pretty much what the deal was all about.  And I say, you know, it would be nice if I could actually have gotten in touch with some of these doctors a little sooner. 
[00:46:30]  You know, that would have been nice.  Have her signed out that day.  But, you know, that's not the way it happened.  But I sat and talked to them.  They seemed to be, you know, pleased as punch that they were being talked about on the air.  And she's fine.  That's pretty much it.  She's here.  She's actually in here today.  I've had that.  You've got to be very careful.  I've actually done an alcohol overdose and wound up in the hospital.  And they come in as soon as you wake up, and they start asking you questions. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And you have to be very –  I had instinct enough to know, to be like, no, this is my first time.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  You know, I gave them all the right answers because they really do want to just throw you in a room.  Grab her real quick for two seconds.  Watch this.  But just watch this.  I got her out yesterday, yeah.  Brought her home.  Everything was completely fine.  Not even an issue.  I mean, things it says committed in the paper.  Committed.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  You've got to have her say so because the first line in the Daily News article says committed to a psychiatric hospital.  Here, baby, how are you feeling?  I'm good.  How are you?  Fine, baby.  Are you feeling better?  Yeah.  Everything's great.  Yeah?  You want to lay down now?  You comfy in your pajamas?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to lay down. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  She feels – see?  Everything's fine.  This show is so messed up.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  How was that?  That's not right.  By the way, that's not Ann doing a voice.  No, that was her Anna.  That was actually her.  That was her Anna Nicole Smith impression.  Yeah.  It's terrific.  Josh in Florida.  What's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Mr. Board Ops, sir.  Yes.  I just wanted to say that you were awesome yesterday, but Mr. Norton destroyed – I haven't heard him that enraged since Dragon Wagon and Kenny from San Jose. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, Kenny from San Jose.  Because we hate dishonest bitches, man.  It comes down to that.  A lot of dishonesty flying yesterday, and it gets ridiculous.  Mr. Kelly, sir.  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Be nice.  I'm good, sir.  I was just wondering why you would think that fat broad would have broccoli flowing through her intestine. 
[00:49:00]  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  You're a smart individual.  Broccoli, and I saw lean cuisine go by.  It should have been a French fry and a piece of meat.  A whole cow head just going.  Like a whole steak tip, not even chewed.  Hey, we got lots of material to get to.  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear a couple MacBook entries?  We got five MacBooks to give away.  Today's the day you got to get your 30-second production piece about the Opie and Anthony show in. 
[00:49:30]  I'd love to hear our talented listeners.  You can send it to 923freefm.com.  It's got to be in today.  We'll announce the five winners next week for the MacBooks, okay?  Yes.  Here's a couple that Danny kind of picked out of the pile that were worth listening to today.  Right?  Danny made the choice?  Yeah.  This is from Aaron R.  Jim Sings Journey. 
[00:50:00]  Okay, I love it.  I love that.  I love it.  They used some kind of pitch transposer on his little... 
[00:50:30]  I love the ones at the end.  Oh, is that funny?  Where's the journey, though?  I don't know why that's funny.  Yeah.  It was just labeled a little weird, but yeah, it's very funny.  What song was that?  I don't know.  Faithfully.  It might have been a journey song, but...  It was some kind of journey song in the background.  It went to the music, and then his own backup is more of his own noises.  Yeah.  I like that one.  All right, let's move on to Bob S.  Oh, Bob S. was the one that came up with the Fatty Pig Fatty promo that we really, really like, right? 
[00:51:00]  Ooh.  Here's Bob S., and his piece is titled Fatty Pig Fatty Time.  Mike!  Have you seen the little game?  It's Fatty Pig Fatty Time!  Fatty Pig Fatty Time!  Fatty Pig Fatty Time!  Yes, it is!  Yes, it is!  Hey, make sure we have a copy of that for the next fat girl that comes in.  It's very hard, because I don't want to confuse how funny Jimmy is with the people's production thing. 
[00:51:30]  Because they could just send in a straight clip of just Jimmy doing something, and I'll laugh like an idiot.  So, you know, that one is funny, because it's Jimmy.  But I'm not sure if it's funny, because it's good production.  We're looking for good production.  Yeah.  Creativity.  Like, the last one was good.  The first one was good production and funny.  And funny.  The second one was funny, because Jimmy was going, Fatty Pig Fatty Time!  The next one is from Mike V. It's titled, Eric and Terry. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, okay, Eric and Terry.  All right.  Maybe we should pre-listen to these things.  It's our own E-Rock, which is Eric, and Terry, which is Terry Shivo.  Terry Shivo, and E-Rock when he was doing his groaning noise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We stink. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's a good one, Doug.  That ending was good.  That was a grand finale.  That's a good one.  All right.  I like that one, too.  Some of the MacBook entries, the winners will be announced next week.  This one was from P-Niggity. 
[00:53:00]  P-O-P, you have a show.  O-P is a radio genius.  Fatty.  Pig.  Fatty.  Anthony does these impressions.  You swear it was the real person.  Man, who dies gay?  I went to the studio today.  Robin was preparing the news.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  Funny Man, Jim Norton, tells the best...  Downgrade and degrade people.  Stop trying to sell your live radio station.  Oh, no.  You go ahead.  You know exactly what I'm trying to do.  Downgrade people.  Downgrade people.  You bring a kid in, it's always adorable. 
[00:53:30]  That is, right?  Kids did it.  Adorable.  That's not bad.  Kid doing Jimmy's bit.  That's not bad.  Oh, you go ahead.  And finally, the last one we'll play today.  This is from Adam R.  Two homos LARPing.  Huzzah!  I gotta cast a spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding. 
[00:54:00]  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast a spell.  Damn, but my beans are egged.  I just cast a spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Dude, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye?  Holy Jesus.  Bravo. 
[00:54:30]  Now someone's saying.  Couldn't be the best one yet.  Someone's saying too long to be an official entry.  It's 36 seconds.  Oh, wow.  That's gotta win a MacBook.  God, don't even start pulling rules because you could cut six seconds off the back end  of just Jimmy talking or whatever, and that is too funny.  Make sure Mark Chernoff allows that one in the contest because that should win a MacBook.  I don't know.  That guy did a great job.  How excited is he right now?  And then, make that, tag that and make that into a promo that we run on our show.  That's how good that is.  Absolutely. 
[00:55:00]  Just tag it.  Don't have Steve redo it or anything.  Just tag it.  You know what he did?  He didn't just take one clip and he had to search for different parts of different shows  to get us to say all those things.  Sound effects, the music.  Right.  Me and you sounding like idiots.  That is wonderful.  That is perfect.  Perfect.  Steve doesn't have to adjust anything there.  Just tag it and throw it into the system as a promo.  All right?  Ting, ting, ting, ting.  Yeah, but the sword noise is too damaged, too damaged.  But I'm a board off, so what do I know? 
[00:55:30]  Well, come on.  But I think that should be a promo.  Just hit the button.  And Opie and Anthony Sweeper.  Very good.  Well, the entries are getting much better.  Yes.  We've got to play that again before we get out of here.  All right.  What else?  We're trying to get through some of the stuff we didn't get to the last couple of days.  Did you hear what happened on Letterman last night?  We weren't on, were we?  No, but did you hear about McGreevy's top ten?  Oh, it was hilarious.  I watched it last night.  Was he doing the actual top ten?  No way.  No, he didn't do it.  Why not? 
[00:56:00]  He's doing everything else.  Man.  I don't know if it was a spoof or whatever they said.  Who did the actual top ten list?  One of their characters.  Some guy.  It was funny.  A cacta.  See, it's safe if you use cactas.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Josh.  Josh, what's up?  Josh.  Josh.  What is up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey.  That was the best clip I've ever heard.  Matt has got to win an iBook.  A MacBook.  All right.  Thank you, Josh.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  LARPing.  Well, it's unfortunate that the listeners don't have the same energy and adrenaline.  No, they're just kind of like, yeah.  Just let me yawn here a minute.  And definitely win a Mac classic.  He should win a Mac truck over his head.  Letterman's top ten chapters in McGreevy's new book.  I can't believe he did this yesterday.  You heard some of these?  I watched it.  It was, you know, I said to this girl I'm with, I go, I can't believe Letterman's letting 
[00:57:00]  us on the show because, you know, it's so edgy.  When we're back on Letterman in December, I'm going to have to say, wow, Dave, this one  was just amazing.  When we do our little chit-chat.  Right.  It's only a couple of months away, right?  You're back on in December already?  Supposedly, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We don't have a date yet, but they said they want us back in December.  How about that?  He's going to bring up random stuff.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, the last couple of months ago, you did something on the show.  Remember that, Dave?  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, you don't get to talk to them at all. 
[00:57:30]  Don't talk to them again.  You don't.  He does.  Anthony Schoel does.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's Christmas time.  You should do it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm going to wear one of those gimp masks with a zipper on my mouth.  Hope you look like a million bucks.  I was all excited.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't shut up.  All right.  Well, in case you missed it last night, listen to this. 
[00:58:00]  Here we go.  Former chapter titles are in the book.  Number 10.  The day I got caught governing myself.  Yeah, that was a chapter title.  Number 9.  Another chapter title.  How to pretend to like girls for 47 years.  That's right.  Number 8.  From Schwarzenegger to Pataki.  Governors, I'd like to oil up.  Oil up.  Oil up.  Oil up.  Oil up the governors. 
[00:58:30]  Number 7.  Another confession.  I can't resist Entenmann's pound cake.  Oh, well, who can?  Are you kidding me?  Who can?  Okay.  Number 6.  At first, I just thought I was bipartisan.  Uh-huh.  Just a little more info on this.  Might be helping us out.  The guy that read the Letterman Top 10 was just a guy with the name James McGreevey, not  the actual guy.  Oh, I see. 
[00:59:00]  They found another James McGreevey.  Funny.  Number 5.  The New Jersey budget crisis.  What would Judy Garland do?  What would she do?  Chapter titles in Jim McGreevey's book.  Number 4.  A look at the governor's balls. 
[00:59:30]  You know McGreevey is kicking himself that he's not here tonight.  Number 3.  Politicians who left the bad taste in my life.  All right, now.  Chapter titles.  Wow.  There you go.  I'll clear the courtroom, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:00:00]  Your Honor, please.  Honor or offer.  Chapter titles in the Jim McGreevey's book.  Number 2.  How to push through a bill.  Or a Steve or a Larry.  And the number 1 chapter title in the Jim McGreevey book. 
[01:00:30]  Why I don't like Bush.  That's just amazing.  That one's very funny.  Wow.  Wow, that one killed.  That's really funny.  Every one of them was good.  Yeah.  And when it's so edgy, Letterman's so good because he'll go, hey, whoa now.  You know what I mean?  He's just keeping himself out of trouble.  He wants to keep his numbers up in San Francisco.  That was just bipartisan.  Listen, that's funny.  Oh, wow. 
[01:01:00]  Push through a bill.  Steve.  Oh, Larry.  Larry.  That's good.  Dennis in Pittsburgh, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just want to say Jimmy really killed last night.  How's our pal?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did he get a nice crowd out there?  Oh, yeah.  Real big crowd.  Like I said, he killed them.  He killed them.  Were they, uh, they didn't, uh, they didn't boo or try to pull that crap, did they?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Jimmy, he doesn't put up with that anyway. 
[01:01:30]  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Way.  How was Club Soda Kenny?  Club Soda Kenny?  Yeah.  Was that that big dude that was there?  That's the big dude that was there.  That's the secret agent man.  All right.  He was the one, uh, pushing all the trinkets and whatnot out there.  Yeah.  Trinkets.  All right, Dennis.  Thanks for the excitement today.  We greatly appreciate it. 
[01:02:00]  Pittsburgh is wide awake this morning, huh?  If you're not riding the incline, you're making viral calls like this.  Jimmy at the Improv all weekend.  Welcome to Wake Up With Pittsburgh.  Wake up with me.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  You know something?  I haven't even thought about her since last I heard that tune.  Yeah, we threw her in the limelight for a couple days.  Yeah, she had like a day in the sun.  See how it works.  Wake up with me. 
[01:02:30]  She had a day in the sun you just can't tell.  Yesterday we were walking back to our hotel room past the color purple and it was emptying.  Not at all.  Really?  It was so funny.  Like the people coming out of, uh, the, uh, four season, what's the four season one?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, Jersey Boys.  And that was letting out at the same time.  It looked like there was going to be a gang war.  It was the whitest of white coming out of that one.  And I don't even know.  Yeah.  Broadway show gang war. 
[01:03:00]  I know.  They're going to snap, whistle, and dance at each other.  Stop.  Fight with the people from the color purple.  Are you out of your mind?  All right.  We're going to move on here.  We got, uh, yeah, we got other things we're going to try to accomplish today.  There's just so many stories in front of us.  Uh, hear about the naked, naked burglar freaking out the women.  No.  And then he went and, uh, played with horses in a field.  Are you dry right now?  No.  Sounds like, sounds like someone describing their dream or something. 
[01:03:30]  And then there was like a horse.  Right when Norton wakes up in the morning, Norton, what's happening?  There's horses in the field.  Oh, let's go.  What's he riding him around going, Equus, Equus.  It's, uh, from Little Rock, Arkansas.  Here's the audio.  A nude man, a horse, and sex, all part of a strange series of happenings in a Texarkana, Arkansas neighborhood.  Now, this is definitely one of those stories made for the water cooler.  The victims can laugh about it now, but when they were living it, it was hardly funny.  Here's Allison Courtney again to explain. 
[01:04:00]  For the Smith family, the day began like any other, but ended in a most unusual way.  When a stranger walked in their front door and headed for their bedroom, announcing he was there for a purpose.  He was still saying, I was here, I was told to come have sex with you.  And I said, no, you're not having sex with me.  I said, I don't know who the heck you are, but you need to get on up out of my house.  Linda Smith says as she and her daughter tried to get the man to leave, he began to strip off his clothes. 
[01:04:30]  We were just, we were scared.  I had my babies in there, and we were like, who is this guy, and what is he doing, and why is he here?  And we didn't know what to take, really.  We were just scared.  Why didn't this guy have a huge hole in his chest by this point?  He says he's going to have sex with you, and he starts taking his clothes off.  You think maybe you better pull out a knife or something there, hillbilly?  I don't think so.  I really don't think so, sir.  I'm like, you got to leave. 
[01:05:00]  This is Texarkana.  You can't just come in and have sex with me.  Where do the horses come in?  Oh, here it is.  When the women called 911, the naked man ran out the door.  Police arrived and found him running nude through a nearby pasture, chasing horses and pulling their tails.  The whole incident has left everyone scratching their heads, wondering what in the world this guy was thinking.  You got to be.  Allison Courtney, today's THV.  You know what the worst part of this is?  I'm trying to get him out. 
[01:05:30]  I got to go pick him up from the hospital this afternoon.  He should be charged with being a silly goose.  It wasn't weird.  This isn't a real crime.  You think it's just silly goose-edness?  Yeah.  You got to be really secure to run naked next to a horse.  That's true.  Yeah.  You know something?  You really look small when you're running next to a horse.  You might want to start out being naked in front of a goat.  A goat.  And work your way up.  I won't even run naked next to Keith Robinson. 
[01:06:00]  That is embarrassing.  Wow.  Yeah, but you're right.  Silly goose.  Silly goose.  Charged with silly goose-edness.  Yeah.  Allison Courtney, today's THV.  Now the alleged streaker, 19-year-old Tim Smith, who's not related to the victims, is being held in a Miller County jail.  No bond has been set.  That's because Smith is now awaiting a mental evaluation.  He is charged with assault, indecency, fleeing, disorderly conduct, refusal to submit to arrest, and burglary for allegedly stealing a pair of shoes from the victims before he ran out of the house. 
[01:06:30]  Shoes.  Horseplay.  Oh, Jesus.  That is a great story.  The thing is, the way they started that story out really made it sound like it was going to be something with bestiality.  Right.  To rope you in.  It's a good story.  Don't get me wrong.  It's a great story.  But the anchor's like, you know, a naked man and horses and sex.  What? 
[01:07:00]  Last time you heard about that, it was in Oregon.  You unbuckle the top button on your pants.  Get all ready for some hotness.  Hang on.  I was going to work, but wait a second.  This story's just silly.  It isn't sexy at all.  Pulling tails.  I've done that.  I used to turn me on.  All right.  We're going to continue.  We got Bob Kelly and Rich Voss.  Are we promoting anything, guys?  You got your DVD out?  Oh, DVD on Amazon.com.  Rich Voss' DVD and Bob Kelly.  Torgasm starts tonight. 
[01:07:30]  35 dates across the country.  Tonight, the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Tonight?  Tonight, Borgata, Atlantic City.  Me, Gary Gullman, and Jay Davis.  Are you hanging with Dane Cook?  He's in town doing SNL.  He hasn't called me, dude.  Oh, boy.  I think it's over.  I think my coattails have just been cut off.  Oh, no.  Is that it?  He's doing SNL, and his movie opens tonight, too.  Employee of the Month.  They just send you...  You're sitting in a room.  They send you a newspaper.  You open it up, and it's his coattails.  What does this mean?  I'm going to sew him back on.  That's what that means.  He's in town, and he hasn't called you yet? 
[01:08:00]  No.  He came over to my house.  You know, it sucks, too, because he came over to my house Tuesday.  Of what year?  I got a one-bedroom.  I got a 42-inch plasma, and I try to, like, tidy it up.  Come on, honey.  Get things...  Dane's coming over.  And he comes in, and he kind of...  You know, you can see him.  Like, the walls are just closed.  Nice hovel.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, man.  What's going on?  He hangs for a little bit, watches, like, one show.  All right, man.  Got to go.  Got to go over to someone else's...  Some other imaginary friend's house.  I got to go back to my hotel that's bigger than your apartment, and then I walk... 
[01:08:30]  He probably just goes to other people's houses like yours to make them feel bad about  themselves, so that he can sit there, look around, and, you know, where you're looking,  going, he's looking.  It's so small, this place.  Oh, this sucks.  He told me about his...  Bobby doesn't have to feel bad about himself.  Yeah, you're right.  He needs a mirror.  Did you hear it coming out first?  I was about to...  And he got it.  No, he told me about his new house that he's buying that actually has a...  You'd love this, you psychopath.  What does he got?  It's a remote control that controls everything, and you can go on the internet and tell your 
[01:09:00]  door...  Like, if I'm at the house and I don't have a key, it's...  Oh, yeah.  It's fingerprint open, by the way, but he can just, from the internet, push a button,  the door opens.  That's great.  On the internet to talk to your door.  It's called Pal Talk, by the way.  Black one?  No, nothing?  Nothing.  I thought that was more of a talk to the wall thing.  Please hold.  I'm not immune to a crash myself every now and then.  Wouldn't it be easier just to turn the knob than to, you know, sign in and press all these 
[01:09:30]  buttons to leave?  You put your thumb on the door.  I know what he's talking about.  On the internet, you can control the climate.  The lights?  The climate.  Yeah, you can turn down the AC, turn up the heat.  The oven is a refrigerator and an oven.  Just to mess with the burglars, you could be turning lights on and off.  What was it?  What do you mean?  It's a fridge oven.  That sounds like the most inconvenient thing ever.  Can I tell you?  Can I tell you?  Please?  Before you jump down my throat.  Dude, it's a refrigerator. 
[01:10:00]  What does it do?  How does it work?  I was ready for popular mechanics, dude.  Dude, let me tell you.  You put in a steak.  You either freeze it or cook it.  Dude, the future is so bright.  You don't need sunglasses.  Dude, I love having you here.  Because this is the real life one.  It's not the Jimmy one.  He just wants to.  Dude, dude.  I've got to hear how this works.  We changed your dude, dude, dude into dude, dude. 
[01:10:30]  This is such.  Jimmy would be here just disgusted with you right now.  But I will stand in.  I have you three that are disgusted.  I know.  I've got to hear this.  All right.  It's a refrigerator stove.  So you could take a frozen pizza, dude, right?  All right.  You put it in, like, in the morning before you go to work, and it stays cold.  It stays cold.  And then at a certain time, you can tell your freezer oven to go, boom, cook that son of a bitch.  And it will.  Oh, and it will. 
[01:11:00]  I got questions.  Okay.  And it.  I'm understanding.  And it will turn on and heat the pizza.  So, all right, I'm going to be home in a half hour.  Bing, ding, bang.  And it cooks the pizza.  So instead of the pizza defrosting and being all soggy.  Yeah, well, instead of having to bring it home, it's solid as a rock, put it in the thing.  It's refrigerator-like.  And it keeps it cold instead of, exactly, being mushy and gooey.  It's not a freezer.  It's like a.  It's a refrigerator.  All right.  Gotcha.  A refrigerator. 
[01:11:30]  It's cold and hot.  Right.  So, but you still got to.  Refrigerator.  So, it's more important if you're going to cook a steak or chicken or something.  Nobody needs this.  Nobody needs it.  You don't want that laying out all day.  In this case, you keep it kind of refrigerated.  And then you go on the internet and say, hey, start cooking my steak.  Cook my ham.  Big deal.  I got to.  Cook my ham.  I got to shower.  That's a bathtub, too.  It's not a big deal.  You know.  You got a what?  Do you have one of those curtains that actually go out a little bit?  I love those.  What do you buy them?  At the hotel, because it gives you that extra room?  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  No, it gives you the room for the water to leak out on the floor.  Oh.  You know what I'm talking about.  They also have.  You know what they also have?  Redo your bathroom.  How's that?  Oh, my God.  You're talking about those bowed-out shower curtains that make your tub seem a little bigger.  That's the hotel that didn't want to spend the money and just put a fatso curtain in.  So they put the fatso curtain in.  It's called the fatso curtain.  I know what you're talking about.  I thought you meant the bathtub goes out that way.  No.  No, just the curtain rod.  The shower curtain.  Yeah, the curtain rod.  I got you. 
[01:12:30]  That's really funny.  Are you going to tell people you redid your bathroom?  No.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  I got something.  So you're with Gary and Jay, right?  Gary, yeah.  He's a funny guy, man.  Gary?  God, is he funny.  Yeah.  No, Gary.  Gary Goldman.  I'm actually without saying.  Gary.  He's a funny dude.  He is funny.  Yeah.  So it's Borgata, Torgasm with Bob Kelly, Jay Davis, and Gary Goldman.  I got to tell you, too, my girlfriend actually choked me out yesterday.  I'm not even kidding.  Can we tease out?  I'm teasing it a little bit right now.  Okay.  I mean, literally, you know, like when you pass out and you wake up like seconds later? 
[01:13:00]  That happened to me yesterday.  A nice radio tease.  Wait, everyone was laughing at.  What did I screw up, Eli?  Oh.  Okay.  But I got a big laugh because they understood what I was trying to say.  Go ahead, Eli.  You said, if you're so bright, you don't need sunglasses.  But I got a big laugh.  I didn't even realize that.  Yeah, so bright, you don't need sunglasses.  Okay.  What was the song?  It was funny, though.  Future song? 
[01:13:30]  What's the song?  Future so bright, you got to wear shades.  Got to wear shades.  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  Thanks, Eli.  It made sense.  Like, it's a kind for me to push a button.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Absurd.  Absurd.  Bill needs coffee.  Friggin' boss, man. 
[01:14:00]  What did he say?  He wanted to say that something was an obscure reference.  And he goes, it's an absurd reference.  It certainly is coming out of you.  Absurd.  Absurd.  Hey, Ann, you know we do the walkover every day to XM.  Yeah.  From time to time, we got some nice things for the walkover.  Today, join us today.  Today, join us today.  Great.  For the walkover.  And you can win a pair of tickets.  You're not going to win a pair of tickets.  We're just going to hand them to you.  You don't have to do anything to Gigantor featuring Megadeth, Lamb of God, and a bunch 
[01:14:30]  of other great bands at the PNC Bank Art Center tomorrow night.  We got tickets on the walkover.  That will be around 9.15 today.  Gigantor.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I thought you guys were done here at 9.  We're done when we're done.  Whenever we want.  Is that the way it rolls now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Christina in New York, what's up?  Oh, I just wanted to call and say I listen to you guys when you come on in the morning. 
[01:15:00]  I work midnights, and it's the best part of the whole night.  Yeah?  What do you like about the show?  It makes me laugh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Joanna, what's up?  I didn't see that coming.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Just wanted to talk about that refrigerator oven idea there he was talking about.  Yeah.  It's not a freezer.  I said that.  It's the refrigerator.  The key word was refrigerator.  Yeah, we corrected him.  Okay.  But, you know, I think the whole concept of frozen food is lost on this guy. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, people are not spending $3,000 on an oven so that they can get their frozen pizza  fresh out of the oven.  I mean, it's for ham and turkeys.  Yeah.  And for a housewife it is, for a single guy that jerks off nine times a day, it's a frozen  pizza.  Go cook a ham.  Well, buy yourself a nice fresh pizza at the local shop.  I don't think you need it.  That is funny that you explained this probably thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of  machinery with a frozen pizza, though. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And you know what?  It's so much more than that.  You have a million dollars worth of computer stuff, and you film yourself sneaking up on  yourself.  You can actually solve world peace with the computer gear you have, Anthony, and you sneak  up on yourself.  I like how you put that, solve world peace.  He knows my attitude and my affiliations.  That is a creepy video that he made, him walking up on himself.  Yeah.  With the creepy lighting like he's on his computer in the middle of the night and there's only  one hall light on.  The creepy smirk with the guy that's coming up behind him. 
[01:16:30]  And it's me.  And it's you.  Where can they find that?  That's on my MySpace, MySpace slash Anthony Cumia.  If you don't know how to read it, look in today's daily news.  It's in there a couple of times.  Look on a bus.  Look on a bus.  That's right.  I actually have the green screen now, too.  Yeah.  So we can get that project going.  We want to do something that I saw on Stephen Colbert's show.  It's a rip off.  Stephen Colbert.  I'll admit it.  He filmed himself in front of a green screen waving around a stick and told his audience 
[01:17:00]  to superimpose and use their computer skills to make a lightsaber or a sword or whatever  and put a background in.  And some of them are really good and really funny.  So we want to get Jimmy in front of the green screen, videotape him doing some provocative  poses and things where people can maybe put in some pornography and drop Jimmy right into  the scene and see how creative people can be.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I can't even cut and paste.  That's a very absurd thing you just said. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  Another thing that's happening, we're trying to get Jerry Springer to win Dancing with  Stars.  Yeah.  Just to show the power of the radio show.  It's our mission.  This started earlier this week.  We got Jerry Springer on the phone.  And he doesn't want to be on the show anymore.  He doesn't?  Nah, he knows he's the goof.  He's hurt, too, he says.  Every one of these shows has the goof.  He's the goof.  Yeah.  You know, when they did Skating with Celebrities, Bruce Jenner was the goof. 
[01:18:00]  Just a clumsy lummox.  Right.  You got guys on Dancing with the Stars or whatever it's called that could really dance.  And then you got, like, Jerry Springer just to make the show a little more fun.  Yeah.  But we decided, screw that.  We want to make Jerry Springer win the whole damn thing.  We'll put him over.  Something's going to happen here.  ABC is going to, like, acknowledge that we're having a huge effect on the show and they're  going to start cheating behind the scenes.  Mm-hmm.  Or they're just going to allow it to happen and let Jerry Springer win the whole thing. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Because the first week of doing this, we were very successful.  Here's the audio.  Harry Hamlin got voted off.  Harry Hamlin.  And he's a much better dancer than Jerry Springer.  And now it's getting down to the...  It's sexy.  Now it's getting down to the real dancers.  So Jerry Springer should have left this week.  Yeah.  That's the reality of it.  Yep.  But they had to vote Harry Hamlin off because our listeners were able to get Jerry Springer enough  votes to keep him on the show.  The goof factor.  Jerry Springer is like on American Idol when they're down to about, I don't know, the top 
[01:19:00]  ten.  And that's when they start dropping out some of the goofy people.  Maybe the top eight.  And you'll get, like, who was it?  Chicken Little was the goofy one.  The stupid crooner.  I left my heart.  A crooner on American Idol.  You know he's not going to win.  You know it's not going to be, you know, oh, we're doing heavy metal music tonight.  Exit light, enter night. 
[01:19:30]  The crooner never wins.  I got audio of the crooner, by the way.  Do you?  Yeah, I happen to have it on the machine.  I hate the crooners.  Every year they put a stupid crooner in.  Well, here's the audio of the crooner.  Yeah, this season's American Idol.  Secret agent man, secret agent man.  I like this crooner.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  And taking away your name.  Was he on a roller coaster when he sang that song?  They got one style of singing. 
[01:20:00]  It doesn't matter what it is.  It's country.  Well, I got friends in low places.  Do you, crooner?  1957 singer?  Get out of here.  He's got the Bobby Soxers voting for him.  Get that reference, Voss?  Yeah, yeah.  It was absurd from 1930.  I thought you were talking about me.  Here's the audio.  It's great because they just start booing because they're like, come on.  Jerry Springer should have been voted off.  But our listeners, our past, got the job done. 
[01:20:30]  These two couples have the lowest overall total when we combine the judges' scores with your viewer votes.  Oh, see, we're not going to be able to get Jerry Springer to win the whole thing.  Well, we really need to.  It's based on viewer votes and the judges.  50% judges, 50% viewer votes.  So we are going to have to.  But this is going to be tough.  You know the judges have just been all voting them off.  It's the people that have been keeping them on the show.  As long as we can keep it just over half the vote. 
[01:21:00]  You know what I mean?  We've got to put them over the judges 50%.  You still have a chance.  Yeah.  You've got to get 60%.  51% or more of the vote, right?  Now forget it.  No one's watching this show to vote on it.  No one cares.  So if our audience is motivated.  Well, our listeners have been pounding the website.  But now that I know the judges are kind of involved, that's how they save their asses.  So this doesn't happen at the end.  Well, a lot of those shows say judges or producers can override. 
[01:21:30]  Right, right.  Oh, forget it.  I mean, we could still try.  But this is what we got done this week, though.  These two couples had the lowest overall total when we combined the judges' scores with your viewer votes.  Harry and Ashley.  Jerry and Kim.  On this third week of competition, the couple with the lowest score and therefore leaving right now. 
[01:22:00]  Jesus.  Harry and Ashley.  Oh, yeah, they're booing.  Jesus.  He was mad, too.  Sounded like Philly.  The guy was mad.  Hamlin?  Yeah.  If you watch the end of the show, he's like looking.  He's just like, you've got to be kidding me. 
[01:22:30]  He's pissed at the end of the show.  I think Harry Springer bribed somebody with a check on that one.  Oh, I'll bring you back the...  That was...  Oh, I know.  All right.  Yeah, no, give it a crash.  Not even a whole one.  So there you go.  We'll see what the pest can get done for next week's vote off.  You know what's funny?  Jerry Springer goes, I'm going to quit the show after I realize I was a goof.  When he was hired, what did he think?  That he's, you know, Fred Astaire?  Yeah.  All of a sudden? 
[01:23:00]  He's got...  He keeps talking about his bad knees.  Like he can barely walk.  Yeah.  I have not even seen it.  I haven't seen one clip of him dancing.  Does he look like he's in pain?  It looks ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  He's going to have to have ACL surgery because you guys keep sending him back out of the dancing  You're going to have to chop his legs off like Gene Gene the dancing machine.  That'd be great.  Jerry Springer rolls out on his show because his legs had to be amputated.  The pest keep making him go dance. 
[01:23:30]  Making him dance.  How great would that be?  Half a Jerry.  Half a Jerry.  Half a Jerry.  Jerk.  Jerk.  Jerk.  Jerk.  Let's go to Andrew in Boston.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys today?  All right.  Hey, man.  I just finished up a MacBook promo.  It's about Anthony's little wine spilling incident.  Yes.  And I want to know if Anthony's going to be a real Nazi about the 30-second limit. 
[01:24:00]  I really...  There was a huge discussion during the commercial break.  Radio still stinks.  P.U.  P.U.  It's got to be 30 seconds.  All right.  That's what we're working with.  The one that we played earlier that is really funny.  And really good.  It ran 36 seconds.  And, of course, it couldn't be 36 seconds.  Why didn't we say in the rules about 30?  About 30.  I would have made things very easy. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  I'd have to cut out the guy going, try the wine.  All right.  Well, just redo it and get it down to 30.  Yours is 39?  39.  Dude, now you're taking advantage.  Now even I have to step in.  All right.  I guess I got an hour to get it done then.  Yeah.  You got an hour.  Get it done.  The deadline is 9 o'clock.  And, Adam R., if you're out there, your promo is great.  It's pretty much going to win a MacBook, but it's too long, so it's not an official entry.  So if you can recut it and get it down to 30.  Yeah.  You got to recut it.  Get it down to 30. 
[01:25:00]  Of course, if you weren't listening earlier, we're talking about this one from Adam R.  Huzzah!  I got to cast a spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast a spell.  Damn, my beanbag.  I just cast a spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage. 
[01:25:30]  Two damage.  Two damage.  Dude, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye?  Wow.  He could take a little of that end music out.  The last six seconds is pretty much nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't take away, so hopefully he'll recut it.  Because that's really good.  I want to give him something for that.  Yeah.  Ben's here.  The author.  Okay.  Do we have time to do...  Author. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, man.  What do we do?  What do we do?  What do we do?  What?  Time for what?  You ever make a sex tape, Bob Kelly?  I actually had a really good one.  Oh, let's go Rachel from Manchester.  Yeah.  I actually...  Oh, it was perfect.  She was in the bathroom.  She's my roommate's girlfriend.  And I walk in and she's like, oh, hey.  Would you direct this thing and write it?  I don't even understand.  I had marks.  I had girls come in, little tape marks on my Papa-san chair.  He had the whole thing blocked off. 
[01:26:30]  I'm not even kidding.  I would have him say things at the end.  Like, that's all, folks.  You're a sick person.  How many sex tapes did you make?  I made a lot of them.  I used to show him to Burr.  He'd be like, dude, I don't want to watch this, dude.  Let's see your ass, dude.  But very similar to me.  Not the same.  Yeah.  But yeah.  Wow.  One was great.  I showed Norton it.  It was just...  This girl's amazing.  Oh, she's amazing. 
[01:27:00]  This other one I made, though, this girl, she looked like I was just raping her.  It was her face was staring into the camera, just not even blinking and bouncing, like  looking.  And then she'd...  Like she...  Whoa.  I think she really liked me.  And the fact that I asked her to do this...  Kind of annoyed her.  I kept cutting it.  Well, I could.  I kept trying to...  Look, you got to act more.  Cut.  Yeah.  Do you keep the tape rolling when they started crying, going, I don't believe I did this  again?  Or I told myself I'd stop?  You still have these tapes? 
[01:27:30]  You know what?  I'll tell you.  I don't know where they are.  Yeah.  I might have a couple of the ones, but the great one, this is...  The great one.  And I swear to God, it was just...  It was almost professionally done.  It was in my...  It was your Citizen Kane, right?  It really...  Is that it?  She was so perfect.  Her acting, she never broke character.  It was in one take.  Oh, character.  She's just so broad having sex with you.  You never saw...  What'd you want her to do?  But you never know... 
[01:28:00]  Break character.  She wasn't...  She was my roommate's girlfriend.  And my girlfriend was in my room.  Not that I have...  Mr. Faber-Sham.  But you never saw me in it, so you could watch it.  What was her motivation?  You thought about the viewers.  Nice.  In my films, you never saw my face.  My films?  In my films, you never saw my face.  That way, my friends could watch it.  If you could recognize my bush fat, then you'd know it was me.  But I'd switch that up, too, so you never know.  Yeah.  I hate that in a porn where you know the guy's bush fat. 
[01:28:30]  It's like, ah, that guy...  That's actually my films.  You know what I mean?  You have to watch a lot of porn to recognize that stuff.  Yes, my catalog.  I'd punch him up on IMDb and...  So what was the motivation for this girl?  Because she wasn't...  She didn't break character.  She...  What did you tell her to be?  I told her...  I said, listen...  Happy.  Right like this.  I said, happy.  I said, you're in the bathroom.  It's in the middle of the night.  You're my roommate's girl.  Okay, he's sleeping.  My girl's sleeping in my room. 
[01:29:00]  I came in to go to the bathroom.  Okay?  So she's going through the cabinets, getting something on my aspirin.  I come in.  I'm in my box of shorts.  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.  She's like, no, no, no.  It's cool.  I go, no, I just...  Let me know when you're done.  No, come on in.  Go ahead.  I go, I got to pee.  Wait, wait.  Be careful what you're saying.  They're going to dump out.  All right.  Well, she goes...  She just basically was like, no, I have brothers and go ahead.  And I was like, no, this is weird.  And she's like, stop it.  You know what I mean?  Like, don't worry about it.  Like, almost like a guy.  Like, come on.  So I was like, all right. 
[01:29:30]  So I start doing it.  She's like, ooh, that's nice.  And she starts...  Jesus Christ.  She's like, you know, sometimes...  I don't know if you have, but I've thought of you.  Have you?  And she comes over and I'm like, ugh.  I'm like...  And I'm fighting it.  That's the best part.  My acting was brilliant.  Oh, was it?  Because I...  Look, I was a camera guy, director, and actor.  You did the handheld or a tripod?  It was handheld.  And I mean the camera.  It was all handheld.  First person.  That was first person.  First person.  First person shooter.  I think you should have done...  First person shooter.  Very good. 
[01:30:00]  I think you should have done it tripod through the bathroom door, slightly ajar.  So you're almost getting a voyeuristic look at it.  And do the whole thing over again from the inside and intercut the two.  So you could have...  It was like...  Yeah.  Next time.  It was 15 years ago.  I'll see if you can get a babysitter for a kid.  So when you were holding a 20-pound old camcorder on your shoulder?  It was a big camera.  But I... 
[01:30:30]  It was just...  Oh, shit.  The only thing...  It was so sexy.  I think of it now, dude.  I used to show people this and every guy I showed, like, dude, that's good.  That's a good one.  You got to release this one.  It's really good.  Yeah.  So I kept it for years and years and I had it in my...  I would have to watch it in my...  Because it was on the tape.  It was on the Hi-8.  So you'd have to watch it in the camera.  Right, yeah.  Or plug the camera into the TV, right?  I had it in the thing.  My camera breaks.  It won't eject. 
[01:31:00]  The tape is in.  I can't send it to the thing to go get it.  The thing.  I can't send it to the guy to go get it fixed because this is in it right in the middle.  Like halfway through it of her, you know, doing her thing.  So I seriously waited a year.  And every once in a while, I go to the camera and just shake it and punch it and try to open this.  You were hoping.  I'm hoping that it would just open.  So finally, it came down to it.  I had to use my camera again to tape some dumb set that never panned out.  Oh, no.  Some dumb agent that never liked me. 
[01:31:30]  And I wound up having to rip the tape out.  I ripped the tape out and I spent days trying to unscrewing those two little screws and that little flappy piece of plastic that goes into the tape popped out.  And I was, like, trying to, like, write down notes like this goes here, that goes here.  Whenever you splice those back together, whenever that part comes by on the tape and you're watching it on TV, you always go, oh, because it starts crinkling. 
[01:32:00]  And you get the fuzz and the buzz and the snow on the television.  And you hope it doesn't get eaten again.  I couldn't do it.  I actually had to throw it out.  Well, no, you didn't throw it out because actually someone here knows where it is and what's happening with it.  It's out Friday wide.  Ah, out Friday wide.  This is the portion of the Opie and Anthony show where you've got to use your own imagination.  People are naming the film that you did.  And one of them is Citizen Blank. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Wow.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Here's your imagination.  And although we don't have the video portion, some of the audio did show up.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I did.  I locked my legs.  But did you guys sit down ahead of time and go, okay, this is how it's going to play out.  I'm going to do this, then you do this, then I do this, then you do this?  Nope.  This girl was probably one of the, this is the girl that brought me.  Was she just improv-ing?  This is the girl that brought me to the edge of, like, I had to, I had to break up with 
[01:33:00]  this girl because I was probably going to wind up, like, being with a guy with her because  she wanted it.  This girl.  What's her number?  Her, that's how, like, I actually, oh, I taught, we used to fantasize about her going  with one of my buddies and it was just her talking to me and it would just get me.  Jesus.  Oh, that's, what are you kidding me?  That's the best fantasy on the planet.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Are you crazy?  How come, how come your best fantasy is your worst nightmare?  Yeah.  Well, because you're, because if that actually happened, you'd be so freaking by now. 
[01:33:30]  But you're, like, when, when, when Bonnie doesn't return your calls.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you call, you freak out and start, like, freaking out.  Where is she?  Why isn't she answering a call?  Who, well, how does the next door neighbor know what color tiles are in my kitchen?  Did you ever find that one out?  No, here, first of all, don't bring up that kind of crap, but here's the thing.  What?  Because here's the thing.  When you're with a girl.  You brought it up.  Are you right?  But here's, you know, when you're with a girl, and I've never done this, but if you  talk about it, it feels like Bobby said, it's crazy because it's a power and a control 
[01:34:00]  thing.  If they're doing it behind your back, then you lose the power and the control.  It's actually a fear of intimacy and you want to make her the whore that you think she  is so you can go, I was right, they're all whores, and I'm never going to get close to  one of these bitches.  That's what it is.  Oh, that's your holy, healthy thinking process.  Wow.  So anyway.  Wow, Bradshaw.  Wow.  Honest to God, though, this is how good of a girl this girl was.  She actually, my friend Al, I called my friend Al one day, because she was like, look, and 
[01:34:30]  I'll come over today.  She goes, is Al going to be there?  And I was like, I got it.  I knew what she was saying.  I call Al.  I go, listen, you come over tonight at 10 o'clock.  Come in.  Don't say anything.  Things are going to go down.  Just go with them.  When they're done, you leave.  Don't ask.  Don't hang out.  Don't ask questions.  Don't try to hit.  What's he, a Marine?  Don't ask.  He comes over.  We're on my back porch.  It's around 10 o'clock.  She has a sundress, no panties, no bra. 
[01:35:00]  He's over there talking to me.  She has a leg.  She does a basic instinct and leaves her legs open.  And I'm talking to him.  He's looking at her.  And I know what she's doing, but I'm pretending like I, I'm just like yapping.  And I see his eyes, his like left eye started going like back and forth.  Like he's having a stroke or like he's looking at him.  It was like quivering.  Just, you ever see that actor, that fat actor with both his eyes just go back and forth like  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  All of a sudden, she goes in the room. 
[01:35:30]  I go, let's go.  We go in.  She's doing me.  And he, I go, listen, dude, I'm, you know, you're with somebody and you're sexually trying  to direct your friend, but you got to whisper because you can't just say, dude, take it out.  You have to go down.  And he's like, and they always pretend.  I don't know.  And you're like, you start getting angry.  Can't you just go in the booth and do the voiceover later or something like that? 
[01:36:00]  But it's always, every time I've been with another guy, I have like a, I think it's like  six.  Everybody else, he's getting, he pulls out this staff that you could sail a ship with and  you can see, I know she didn't want it because she liked me, but her eyes went like, you know,  like opened wider.  Oh boy.  She was with me and then she was like, oh, but then she like, like blindly grabbed his  and you could see she went, I think he's getting too detailed.  Hold on, hold on.  They're dumping out like crazy.  Forget it.  You're getting a little detailed. 
[01:36:30]  Forget it.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great.  It was unbelievable.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  That was very good.  We're going to take a break and we're in the bathroom together.  Well, I think I'll just stay here.  Yeah.  Your films.  Thank you for, you try to find someone else.  Faggot.  Wow.  I know Omo.  The reviews are in, by the way, on his films.  Steve?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Steve didn't like it.  Well, I asked that question and I had no clue to be honest what the answer would be.  It was just a setup because Screech made a sex tape. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  We'll talk about that next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  So where were we?  We got Rich Voss, Bob Kelly in studio.  Where were we?  That's the problem.  We were yapping during the commercial break. 
[01:37:30]  About 80 different things.  Yeah.  And we got Ben in studio.  We'll talk to you in a second, Ben.  Unless you want to pipe in on sex tapes because that's what we're talking about.  I can think of some stuff.  You ever make a sex tape?  Have I ever made a sex tape?  Yeah.  Not one that someone's going to find, but maybe somewhere along the line.  Somewhere.  Erased?  I don't know.  No tape in the camera?  That's the chicken way to do it.  Yeah, no tape in the camera.  That's the chicken way to do it.  Yeah.  No.  You don't put a tape in the camera and you just have it set up on the TV and then you 
[01:38:00]  look at how ridiculous you look.  It's pretty stupid looking.  Why do you want to save it for later?  Like a prostitute's head after you cut it off?  Never had the balls.  I mean, because everyone thinks they look like a rock star when they're having sex and  then, you know, then you realize how awful you look like it.  I didn't know they were gray.  There's a pink pimple.  What?  Pimples?  There's no reason to make a tape because you don't want to watch it back. 
[01:38:30]  Unless, you know, you, you're making films with storylines and everything.  But most people are just propping a camera up by a bed.  Yeah.  And they just get a tape.  Why are you then going to watch that later?  Unless maybe, I guess if you're in the lifestyle of, of, you know, girls are pouring in your  place, you know, every, a different one every day, but here's what you got to do.  Cause if you're with a gal and then the breakup and the breakup is horrible and she starts,  the breakup is horrible.  And she starts coming after you for this and that. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, I got the tape.  Now you're using it for blackmail.  Wait, didn't that happen?  Somebody.  Do you know that's illegal by the way?  Oh, it is.  It's called extortion.  Not if you get them to go, can I tape you doing this?  Yes, you can.  I give you my.  You can.  Yeah.  Could I tape this and then use it later to bribe you or have you.  This is my favorite part though.  Have you given me something under duress in court?  Honestly, God, they all say this.  I've done probably six of them.  They all, you better not show your friends.  You better not show your friends. 
[01:39:30]  Of course I'm not.  I want you to show my family.  No, I'm not going to show.  Christmas time.  Let's pop this in.  Forget your friends.  I'm bored of the Grinch.  This is just for me.  This is just for me, honey.  Why would I do that?  Of course.  Are you out of your.  I'm going to show all my friends.  Why do you think my face isn't in it?  Well, let's get to the Screech story.  So Screech made a sex tape.  He's pretty desperate.  He is really desperate.  He's losing his house or something.  Dustin Diamond.  We had him on the show back in the day.  He was voted worst guest ever. 
[01:40:00]  Voted worst guest ever.  No kidding.  The listeners, they have all this stuff they do behind the scenes.  And they have voted worst guest ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  A close second was a guy from Jersey that made balloon animals for us.  No, no joke.  And he was second.  He was second.  You had a balloon animal guy on the radio.  Dustin Diamond beat out balloon animal guy.  This was better.  Worst guest ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  This was better than Screech.  I forgot. 
[01:40:30]  That worked out better than Screech.  That guy was on a reality show.  He was a local kid.  So we brought him in.  I don't even remember the reality show anymore.  Trying to be some kind of comic magician or something.  And all of a sudden, he's making balloon animals for us.  And we were...  We're sitting there going, oh, maybe this wasn't a good booking.  Because he made balloon animals on this reality show.  It was his thing.  Like, that's what he did on a boardwalk somewhere in Jersey.  And then he got on this reality show.  And you know how they cut reality shows and stuff?  They kind of...  Was it Big Brother?  I don't even know.  They didn't even make him look entertaining.  But they kind of made him look like an interesting character. 
[01:41:00]  Like, that he's doing this in this house with these people in.  So we had him on and realized, oh, my God, no.  He's just a guy that makes balloon animals.  How interesting.  Wouldn't you think he was a Salvador Dali balloon animal maker?  You don't know.  You know how they cut that.  They made you look interesting, you son of a bitch.  Hey, really fast.  Back to the old playing tennis and ironing your clothes was interesting for some reason.  We're going to have you here instead of an ironing board?  I should have suggested that you do a few different household chores.  Yeah.  Come on, do the wash. 
[01:41:30]  Jeremy in Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  This whole sex tape thing started making me think of one of my lady friends whose dad just had a heart attack  because her ex-boyfriend decided to send him the tape.  They just had, like, a nasty break.  See?  Yeah, that wouldn't be something Dad would want to see, you know?  Hey, what's this we got here?  I would.  You would?  Dad had a heart attack over the tape?  Yeah, he saw the daughter's sex tape.  He hung up.  Okay.  Screech sex tape story.  He ate it with mayo.  But first, because Fox has just whacked, a retraction of story about Anna Nicole Smith selling her son's belongings. 
[01:42:00]  Remember we talked about this on the show?  Yeah.  And we thought, there's no way this could be possible.  She decided she was going to sell her son's remains on the internet.  Was that funeral costs or something, some weird story that didn't quite make sense?  It was a huge story.  I think it made the front page of some papers, and then, of course it wasn't true, and then Fox had to say this.  First off, let me start by saying that last week we reported a story about Anna Nicole Smith's supposed plans to sell items belonging to her late son, Daniel. 
[01:42:30]  We reported those items included the last photos of Daniel before his death, as well as personal items of his, including his remains.  As it turns out, the source we used to base the story on was unreliable and inaccurate, and thankfully, the story was untrue, and Fox 5 regrets the error.  All right, that said, from sex tapes to big breakups, it's tonight's Celebrity Wrap-Up.  What an apology.  Unreliable source.  Some unreliable source. 
[01:43:00]  Some homeless guy from Times Square or something.  They were obviously too embarrassed to name the source because it was probably, yeah, somebody that just, an anonymous call.  Right.  A posting.  You know how some people sometimes post things on eBay that aren't real?  It was probably something like that.  Someone called them.  Like a Rolls Royce or something for cheap?  Yeah, that smells like sauerkraut in the trunk.  Right, Rich?  Yes.  Rich has been known to try to buy cars off of eBay.  I got kicked off of eBay. 
[01:43:30]  You should be.  You bought a freaking car.  No, I got three strikes against me.  I'm trying to get back on.  You are, for selling stuff?  No, for bidding on stuff.  Ended up not buying it.  Like, I put in bids saying I bought it.  You know, I won it.  But then circumstances came up.  And now, I got kicked off of eBay.  Can't you just tell them you're Jewish?  And that's why I was reconsidering the price.  By the way, Ben, this is all leading to you.  Yeah, yeah.  We're all leading.  Just sit there and enjoy.  Don't worry.  You're doing my football picks this week, too, by the way. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, someone is saying worst guest ever, Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler is one of the best guests ever.  If it would have played out like he would have wanted it to play out, it would have been worst guest ever.  But he ended up being a great guest because it just fell apart.  Right.  That was a catastrophe, cluster F segment that was fantastic.  I listened to the replay of that once.  It was so cringe-inducing, the way you treated him.  I had to hide my head.  As it was happening, I tried to make believe I wasn't there. 
[01:44:30]  But I'm just a board op, so.  Well, we all know that.  What did you do, Ope?  You didn't hear Steve the Whistler?  Please tell me what you did.  I thought it was a good deal that day.  Steve the Whistler is like a champion whistler.  I guess this is a big deal somewhere.  I think it's a big deal in, like, Holland or something.  If he has a CD out.  He had a CD out.  Really?  Now I'll do New York State of Mind.  And he starts whistling the songs.  It is the dumbest thing ever.  And he's got a CD that has music, so he whistles along with the music. 
[01:45:00]  So we're like, hey, wow, let's hear you whistle.  You know, because he's a world champion, I guess.  And Ope's, like, playing it up, like, hey, what track do you want me to pop in?  And he picked a song, and it's just the music, and he whistles along with it.  Right.  Ope pops it in, and just, he plays it.  Steve starts.  Steve starts getting into it with his whistling.  With his whistling.  Showing his talent.  And then I would just stop the CD without him knowing it.  Stop it in mid-stride, and the music's gone. 
[01:45:30]  And then, of course, Ope's like, oh, damn, why doesn't this equipment work?  And we're all getting angry that the equipment's broken and apologizing to him.  And seeing how many times he'll restart this song over and over again.  And then we got the CD to work, and all of a sudden I decided to whistle with him.  It was so embarrassing.  Yeah, because I was making fun of his profession, I guess.  He doesn't need a backup whistler.  His arse.  It got so bad that Jimmy left the studio, Anthony went and hid behind equipment. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I had to hide.  It was just me and Steve.  I had to hide.  Steve the whistler.  But it's one of the best cringe-inducing segments.  If you ever get a chance to check it out, download it, yeah.  We should throw it up on opanthony.com.  Can we do that, E-Rock, over the weekend?  E-Rock!  Steve the whistler on opanthony.com.  That's what I want to see.  It's really, really funny.  All right, here's the sex tape.  Screech's sex tape.  The latest in celebrity sex tapes is Screech from Saved by the Bell? 
[01:46:30]  According to TMC.com, the admittedly broke Dustin Diamond and two unidentified ladies caught on an alleged tape  is now in the hands of a Phoenix-based agent, according to the Daily News.  But Screech's rep, who hasn't seen the tape, says, quote,  Dustin has been trying to escape the Screech typecast, so this may help me get more bookings.  I'm sorry, but does anyone, and I mean anyone, want to see Screech in his skivvies?  I mean, aside from maybe his wife, I think not.  Besides, I'm guessing it might not be Oscar-caliber work. 
[01:47:00]  She'd want to see him.  Like anything with Oscar.  Wasn't Jimmy saying yesterday that supposedly he's hung?  He supposedly is now the new record holder since Uncle Miltie died in Hollywood.  Yeah, he's the most well-endowed in Hollywood now is the story.  Screech, can you believe that curse?  That is God going, ha, watch what I put on this idiot.  He's got retard junk. 
[01:47:30]  That's why Screech drives along the floor.  That's what the girls do.  He's got retard junk.  And we can't say this?  What is that?  Well, then I'm saying it for the XMers, so screw you.  I'll just dump out.  On this tape, he does a dirty Sanchez.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How could you not say that?  I don't know.  Oh, is that silly?  You can't say that, but he does that on the sex tape.  I don't even know.  What the hell is that again?  Oh, you can't describe it. 
[01:48:00]  Look, look, look.  It's like, don't even start.  Because once the, you know what happened?  The angry guy.  You know what happened?  Can't say it.  You know what happened in radio?  There was this, like, time.  It was about a six-month period of time in radio where every show did nothing but describe  all of those acts that are given these weird names on websites.  You know, you've got, like, 20-page-long email from your friend about what this wacky name is.  Hey, let's do the ceiling tile. 
[01:48:30]  Or you ever hear of the, you know, this one or the doggie's revenge or whatever, you know.  And I'm making these up so you don't have to dump out of them.  And they would go into graphic detail of describing them and get FCC violations.  So in its infinite wisdom, radio itself decided to censor by not even allowing people to say the names of these things.  Anymore, yeah.  So if we have a guest that writes a book, let's say your name was Ben Sanchez, okay? 
[01:49:00]  And we were a little annoyed that he hadn't showered.  We couldn't even describe that.  It's a catastrophe.  He is brilliant.  That was pretty good.  Thank you.  All right.  Now shut up about it.  All right.  So now everyone hopefully understands what was on that tape.  Mark in Florida, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Screech was on the radio this morning in Tampa talking to the local show here.  Yeah.  And he is crapping himself, man.  And evidently this is part of a game he was in with some celebrities called Poke Em. 
[01:49:30]  And once a month they'd have a pot.  They'd send in their tapes and they'd get points for different things caught on tape.  See, that sounds like a lie.  That sounds like something he's doing.  If there is even an inkling that this got let out, like he didn't want this out,  you know, people can do that if they're real celebrities with real careers.  This is a pure desperation move the guy's got to make. 
[01:50:00]  Come on.  No, what he's saying is that the other people involved are some A-listers, man.  He says they're some heavy hitters.  What A-listers hanging out with his Screech?  Right.  Just stop it.  You want to train six days?  Hey, Angelina.  It's Screech.  Yeah, Screech.  You coming over with the tapes?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Butch Patrick.  Butch Patrick.  That's a great A-lister.  Yeah.  C-listers, maybe.  Oh, God.  Barry from Pittsburgh.  We need Opie's brother to make a I've Got Retard Junk t-shirt. 
[01:50:30]  That's funny.  I'd love to see Amis wear that one.  Yeah, my retard junk shirt deal.  When am I going to get my I Got Retard Junk shirt?  Goddamn Opie's brother won't send it to me.  That's a great O's, man.  Yeah, last week, I was really clogged, so I know Jimmy had Mucinex in the studio, so I  went into his little Mucinex bottle, and there were blue pills. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't know the Mucinex came in blue pills, so I had to be clogged up all morning because  I thought I might be taking a boner pill instead of a Mucinex pill.  So then I came up with, I took a boner pill t-shirt, or I came up with a saying, and now  the websites are selling them like crazy.  I think Retard Junk is my favorite.  I like that one, too.  That one's even better?  Oh, that's great.  Ben, are you going to talk or what?  Jesus.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, my God.  Jesus.  I like it.  Don't you know how to promote yourself?  That's a good story, though.  That's why he's an author.  I'm a big Saved by the Bell fan, so it's good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's great. 
[01:51:30]  Grow up watching it and then realize, oh, my God, he's doing porno to bail himself out.  It might help.  We'll get a new housemate.  Let me introduce Ben.  You never know.  Ben, how do you say your last name?  Mesrick.  Mesrick.  I got to tell you, when we got fired from radio or put on the beach, as they say, that's  what they say in radio.  Oh, he's on the beach.  Make it sound nice.  Little known fact, I read over 100 books.  Really?  Yeah, in that two-year period.  I was a reading machine, and one of my favorite books was Bringing Down the House, and you 
[01:52:00]  were the author of that, right?  That's right, yeah.  I know we're going to promote the new one, which sounds really interesting as well, but  Bringing Down the House was a fascinating story, and I hear they're making a movie out  of that, right?  Yeah, we're shooting this January with Kevin Spacey is producing and starring as a professor  who recruits the team and trains them.  Yeah, basically, it's a bunch of MIT students.  Yeah, from Boston.  A bunch of MIT kids came up with a card counting system, and they made $6 million in  Vegas, and then Vegas came after them, and Private Eyes followed them back to Boston, 
[01:52:30]  and they nearly got hurt.  What was great was that it got to a point they were getting kicked out of all the casinos  in Vegas, so then they started going to the casinos in Memphis or whatever, the boat casinos,  and they kept going and going until just about everyone in the business knew what they were  doing.  Yeah, these guys still get kicked out.  I get kicked out of casinos for hanging out with them in Vegas now.  Really?  This is years later, and they can't walk into a casino still.  And you wrote the book?  I spent a lot of time going to and from Vegas with them every weekend, and I would strap 
[01:53:00]  $200,000 to my body and carry it from Logan.  Oh, so you were one of the guys that carried the money and stuff.  When I research it, I like to get inside my books as much as writing is a really boring  stuff.  Were you friends with these guys at MIT?  No, I went to Harvard while they were at MIT.  Oh, man.  So how did you get involved with it?  I still love Screech and his sex tape, right?  So I was hanging out at a local bar in Boston called Crossroads.  I don't know if you ever went there.  But I got introduced to them by a girl who was dating one of the players, and she had played 
[01:53:30]  on the team as the hot blonde, because they would have a hot blonde on the team so the casinos  wouldn't think they were card counters.  And I met him, and then I went over to the main guy's house, and his real name is Jeff  Ma, and he had hundreds of thousands of dollars in his laundry, like stacks of $100  barrels.  So I asked him what was going on, and he took me to Vegas the next day, and I flew with him  and five of his friends, and they just pulled out money.  They had like a million in cash on them, and they were hitting the casinos.  And so I got a look at it, and I thought, this is awesome.  I was writing thrillers at the time, and I thought, this is better than any fiction. 
[01:54:00]  I highly recommend the book, because these guys would fly out on a lot of things.  They'd be in class all day Friday, then get the flight out to Vegas.  They were the geekiest guys you ever met in Boston.  I mean, these guys were math nerds in Boston.  They'd hit Vegas with velvet shirts and this whole thing, and made millions doing it.  Did you think at first, like, it's got to be some kind of, everyone's got a gimmick,  a money-making gimmick, and that you were going to go, the first time that you saw it,  you thought, I'm going to see them lose.  Well, you know what?  They do lose. 
[01:54:30]  They only have a percentage edge.  Some weekends, they lose.  I watched them lose $110,000 in two hands.  I mean, they lose.  You know, you're talking about a college kid.  But when you start getting kicked out of casinos, you know this is real.  Yeah, true.  It's why the casino is kicking you out.  Why did you have to smuggle the money in?  Because even though it's legal to move your own money around,  if you get caught in an airport with $100,000 on you,  they immediately assume you're a drug dealer,  and they put you in a room and they handcuff you and they can hold you 24 to 48 hours  and the DEA comes in and the IRS comes in, which is not good either.  So it's on a $10,000. 
[01:55:00]  It's $10,000.  It becomes a big mess.  And, you know, so, you know, and also there's that old rumor that 90% of $100 bills have cocaine on them,  traces of cocaine.  So you don't want to carry tons of cash around with you.  And, you know, you can't take it out of the bank because then forms are flying all over the place.  So basically they would keep it in safety deposit boxes all over Vegas.  The team in Busting Vegas, which is the new one,  they found an old safe in the basement of an MIT administration building,  and they kept all their money on campus.  So they would come on Friday and make a withdrawal from this administration building 
[01:55:30]  of a million dollars every morning,  and then they'd fly out to Vegas that night and then put it back in the safe.  And this was the brainchild of a professor at MIT, right?  The original team was – it actually has been handed down since the 70s.  Since the 70s they were doing this through MIT.  A new group of students is recruited every year.  There's a group right now doing it.  And a professor sort of guided them along and taught them what they were doing.  It's like a math thing, you know.  It's high math to do this.  And really fast because they would practice.  Oh, yeah, six hours a day in, like, fake casinos where, you know, girls – 
[01:56:00]  Fake casinos.  It would be someone's dumb apartment and you go upstairs.  Next thing you know you go through a door and they have a fake casino set up.  So these students could practice their accounting and how they were going to pull it off.  They can actually – they don't even look at the table.  They take a glass of scotch and they put it on the table and they count the reflection in the scotch glass so they don't have to even look at the cards.  It's amazing.  It's amazing to watch these guys in action.  And some of the code words now – you've got to bear with me.  I read the book about three years ago and I thought it was brilliant. 
[01:56:30]  Well, they had lots of –  They would have conversations.  Yeah, and so, like, if you wanted to pass the count to someone else, you know, you could say something like,  Oh, you know what?  I think I left the cat out at home.  And cat would mean nine.  So the count is plus nine, which would mean, you know, you want to bear with me.  Explain plus nine, though, for now.  Well, it's all – it's a high-low method.  It turns out in blackjack, if there are more high cards still in the deck, you have an advantage because the dealer is going to bust more often.  You're going to hit blackjack.  So you just keep track of the high to low cards.  And the higher the count means that more low cards, you know, have come out, which means there's more high cards. 
[01:57:00]  Every time you see a card come out, it's either plus one or minus one or neutral.  So you keep doing this in your head.  I know it sounds complex, but it's really hot.  I've seen it done on Discovery Channel.  They did a whole thing.  But I really enjoyed the code words.  Yeah, lots of code words.  What were some of the others?  Which is – can you say – I don't know.  Oh, the T word?  Yeah, can you say that?  No.  You can't say that.  No.  That's crazy.  I mean, I can see the 30 one.  It is really stupid.  Yeah, okay.  Well, yeah, which is whatever would be – what was that?  13, you know, because it's right or whatever. 
[01:57:30]  You had – there were – you know, every number had a certain thing attached to it.  You also had hand signals.  Like if you crossed your arms, you meant someone should come.  The big player was the guy carrying the cash.  Well, because the guy sitting at the table –  You had set up guys.  What happens?  You have six people spread across the casino, one person at each table, keeping track of the cards.  They would call in the big player who's acting like a real high roller, who's covered in money and wearing velvet and have girls on his arms, usually strippers.  He'll slide into the table and bet $10,000 a hand.  So you'd have to pass him the signal and everything, and then he'd get up and he'd move. 
[01:58:00]  So from the casino's point of view, it's just one big player betting $10,000 everywhere.  They don't see the card.  But he is immediately sitting into a situation that's already been built for him to have the advantage.  So your $10,000 bets are only betting there.  But in Busting Vegas, the wild system – this kid could get aces to come out when he wanted to.  There's a system where you can actually get an ace lined up, and that's what Busting Vegas is about.  I wasn't going to do another Vegas book, and this guy – I went to Vegas with this guy, and basically he's sitting next to me, and he goes, 
[01:58:30]  Bet big now.  And I'm like, why?  And he goes, because you're going to get an ace.  And the next card is an ace.  Wow.  All right, listen, hold that, and we'll see what that's all about after the break, okay?  Because we've just got to take a break really fast here.  It's Busting Vegas is the new book by Ben.  Meserick?  Meserick, yeah, that's good.  Meserick, okay.  We'll continue with Ben in a few minutes here.  Really fast, I'll bring it down the house.  I mean, your writing was great, how you just described how these guys were sweating and feeling the pressure of walking through airports and stuff.  Because I did it.  With a couple hundred thousand dollars strapped to their bodies and hoping they didn't get caught. 
[01:59:00]  And it just – I love the book, man.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I hope the movie is as good as the book.  You know the body cavity search comes if they find you with money strapped on you.  You just know the glove is coming out.  But we'll explain how the guy knew an ace was coming out of the deck next.  Yeah.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  So, I think Dane Cook's calling in. 
[01:59:30]  Bob Kelly just got a text message from him.  Ooh.  Hey, really fast.  And we got Ben Mesrick in studio.  His new book is called Busting Vegas.  Peter M. from Massachusetts, by the way.  Hey, Opie, Ben wrote the book, but you go ahead and tell the story.  I get excited sometimes.  It's a book I know.  I know.  And, you know, the author's in here.  Just switch places.  Oh, we could sit on the couch and talk about the book.  Right, right, right, right.  I'm telling you, you know, that's a good compliment, though. 
[02:00:00]  I read over 100 books in that two-year period, and it's...  This is the one you remembered.  Easily top five.  One.  Easily.  Yeah, but four is Curious George.  Harry Potter.  Harry Potter.  The first three.  That web that Charlotte made.  Hey, can you do my football picks?  Your football picks?  No, but I can get you the guy from Bringing Down the House, and he's a football genius.  Do you know football?  No, he knows.  I know I'm a fan, but I don't know.  Oh, you don't know.  That's perfect.  But he's a sports guy.  Anthony, explain what's going on with the football.  Well, there's a whole big football pick contest going on between the staff of the show, and 
[02:00:30]  the prize money's huge.  What is it?  $10,000.  $10,000.  $10,000.  Yeah.  So they're taking it pretty seriously, but Opie isn't taking it pretty seriously.  That's what he wants to do.  Because it would really suck if he won, and these poor bastards are all like, Jesus.  Ben, what Anthony's trying to say is, I'm a millionaire, and the guys behind the scenes,  they make about $10 an hour.  So it would really suck if I end up winning the $10,000. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  But I'm in there just to make it interesting, and if I do win, I will throw $10,000 out of  a helicopter.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm not nice enough to give it to the staff behind the scenes.  Right.  If they don't beat me, they're going to have to watch me throw $10,000 out of a helicopter.  I'm sure they're going to be like, come on, fall out.  But here's the deal.  Fall out.  I'm doing dumb things every week to get my football picks.  Like, in Cleveland last week, I had a Fatty Pig Fatty do it.  How did you do that?  And she went four for five, by the way.  Four for five.  Four for five.  There you go. 
[02:01:30]  And Ben has made my football picks.  He's taking the Vikings over the Bills this week.  He's taking the Dolphins.  Big Ken will be happy about that over the Texans.  Chicago Bears over the Seahawks.  The Patriots over the Bengals.  I got to do that.  And, yes, Redskins over the Jaguars.  That's my picks this week.  There you go, man.  Oh, yeah.  And the football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Ben, you're going to have to sit for another minute or two.  The new book is Busting Vegas, but we've got to say hi to Dane Cook. 
[02:02:00]  Dane, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We were getting a little sad yesterday.  We're like, Dane Cook's in town.  He's doing SNL.  He's got the big movie opening today, and he's not calling the Opie and Anthony show.  I got it.  Believe it or not, anybody who says I'm going to read my fucking MySpace is a liar.  That's how I found out that you guys wanted me to call him this morning.  Dane, we're not on XM, dude.  This is free FM.  We're 15 minutes to XM.  Basically, he said, yeah, he found out through his MySpace that he should be calling the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:02:30]  I'm sorry.  I thought it was at the cellar.  Hey, Bob Kelly was explaining this refrigerator stove of yours.  What is it?  I told him that you came over to my 700-square-foot apartment, and you told me about you're looking at new houses,  how you looked at that new house with a remote control that does everything.  You actually had a fridge, refrigerator, slash stove mechanism.  He has TVs in every bathroom that you can do. 
[02:03:00]  But you got to.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, millionaires.  Bob's life is so boring, he's talking about your appliances.  I was just telling him how I felt bad that you're over my living room, slash office, slash kitchen.  Dane, how does that feel?  Bobby's living room looks like the storage room in a 7-Eleven.  It's just an absolute mess.  There's like mop buckets next to the plasma.  Big boxes of styrofoam cups.  Wrappers on the floor.  Just dented food. 
[02:03:30]  How does it feel when you're at the point where other people are just describing your appliances?  I know.  That is just, I know, it's what you just said, but it's just, it's really sinking in, like,  oh my God.  You never know what people are talking about when you're not there.  They're talking about your appliances.  I'm talking about Dane Cook's refrigerator.  Dane's potential appliances, because he hasn't bought a house like that.  And he described it like, you know, if he has a frozen pizza, he can cook it from online.  Oh my God, Bobby.  I know.  Bobby.  Bobby would, just saw you on, what, the Today Show? 
[02:04:00]  Were you on there?  I just did that a few minutes ago.  I just saw it right over Opie's head while we were talking.  I'm like, hey, there's Dane.  How is that to do?  There's nothing like trying to get a word out with a thousand Janet Jackson fans behind you.  Yeah, because Janet's playing live, I guess.  I had to like, every answer, it was like, so tell me about the new movie.  I was like, well, it's very Rhythm Nation-like.  It's almost like Janet's Troll album, you know?  Did you rip your shirt open and pop one out? 
[02:04:30]  No, but can I tell you, I don't know if you saw this, it was like the weirdest moment for me ever.  I said something that Matt Lauer found funny, and then he gave me the pound sign.  And I was pounding Matt Lauer on the Today Show.  It was very strange.  First time that's happened.  And you're doing SNL again.  Yeah, I'm actually over here now.  We're doing a full day of rehearsal, and the Killers are here, and they sound awesome, man.  I was watching them yesterday.  Yeah, we'll all be watching tomorrow night.  Yeah, it's going to be a sick show.  And Employee of the Month, Dane, huh? 
[02:05:00]  Employee of the Month, next week, yeah.  Yeah, you are just too goddamn big.  I'm on a tear, as they say.  We had Pedro in, helping promote your movie there.  Oh, yeah, Fran came in.  Was it him, or was it his twin?  Sometimes if he's too lazy, since his twin.  Oh, you know what?  I heard that he has an exact duplicate twin.  I told you that.  Yeah.  Don't say you're hurting.  I know, Bobby.  I told you, and you gave me crap for it.  Okay, Bobby.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Calm down and just tell us what Dane's toaster is like.  I know. 
[02:05:30]  Dane, I got to tell you something.  I'm wondering if it was his twin now, because I'm looking at this guy going, he doesn't,  he looks like Pedro, but if Pedro was a little off.  It was his twin, because he asked for my phone number, so you know how to do.  And they won't admit it, but Efron told me, he goes, yeah, sometimes I just can't make  it, and I'll just send my twin.  And they do it a lot.  Wow.  He sent his twin to my employee of the month party that we had in LA the other night, and  the whole night I'm calling him Efron, and then at like two minutes before release, he's 
[02:06:00]  like, I'm his brother.  Later.  He's congratulating him.  He's like, yeah, great job in the movie.  He's like, thanks, man.  I gave him my number, too.  I don't want to give the twin to my number.  You got the twin.  I got the twin, Mexican.  Wow.  I never thought that.  That could have been him.  Hey, Dane, thanks for calling me all week, though.  I'm glad we could spend some time this week, and you could return some.  I feel like the fat, fat chick.  You are.  You are.  Well, touche, Anthony. 
[02:06:30]  Team damage.  Did you forget that I came over to your veal box?  You know what, Dane?  He was telling the story on the air, and he could tell that you were like, just, you  know, just putting in some time.  You watched one show.  I was like, well, I got to go.  I got to go back to my huge hotel room.  Well, there's nothing more unsettling than every 10 seconds your best buddy saying, dude,  don't look at my girl's new boobs.  She's got new boobs?  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Bobby.  That's an hour of radio.  Apparently, me ratting out your fridge oven is the same to you ratting out my chick's new 
[02:07:00]  boobs.  I thought that you told those guys.  Sorry, dude.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's so weird.  It's like, I really want to stare at Don's breast, but I can't.  Yes, you can.  As soon as you tell her, you'd hear the segment before this.  Yeah.  As soon as you tell someone not to stare, the first thing they're going to do is, look,  you can't help it.  Well, I told you, Norton was at my house, and we were sitting on the couch watching TV,  and my girl comes out.  You could hear the bathroom door open.  I go, Don, put a shirt on. 
[02:07:30]  Norton's head spun around so fast.  When he realized that she had a shirt on, I was just joking.  Oh, you were just trying to call him out?  Yeah.  He goes, dude, what?  No, I just want to make sure she was all right.  All right.  What are you, what are you, you were surprised though?  It's like, throw your dog a steak and go, look, he went for it.  I know, it's Jimmy Norton.  He does feed my dog his own boogers.  He really isn't on the, high up on the evolution chart.  Hey, Dane.  Yeah.  Torgasm 2?  I want to do it, man, yeah.  I'm actually, I was telling Bobby that I want to do it, I'd like to do a thing over in Iraq 
[02:08:00]  with these guys.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm trying to put something together now that we go over there, even maybe over Christmas,  and do some shows.  But we'll see.  I want to do it, though.  You know what you should do, you should have balls and just drive that awesome tour bus  of yours all over Iraq's.  Right down, yeah.  One of the main drags that are just like, I've been blown up every two minutes.  You know, that whole thing.  We just throw Jay Davis and his underwear out in the middle of the desert.  He has to meet us at, you know, at Fallujah. 
[02:08:30]  Is that what we do?  Nice talk.  Is that what we do?  Oh, really?  Someone listens to me.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  He got you.  Step down a landmine, man.  Step down a landmine, man.  And the landmine makes pizza.  Ha, ha.  Right.  Well, hey, you're taking over YouTube now there, Dane.  Yeah, the YouTube is pretty wild, man.  There's a lot of stuff, a lot of content on the YouTube.  We love YouTube.  We got about 700 videos up there ourselves.  Well, Dane's got 6 million.  Yeah, I know.  I think. 
[02:09:00]  I thought we were doing pretty good, and then I actually did throw you in the search and  went, oh, God.  He already took over the MySpace.  You're like the Hitler of the Internet.  You're just like, you're blitzkrieging your way over every new country that pops up on  the Internet.  Just remember, Russia's out there, my friend, someday.  We were proud because one of our videos got viewed over 100,000 times, Bill Berg going  after that crowd in Philly.  I watched it on YouTube.  Oh, is that great?  It's unbelievable.  If you haven't seen it yet, just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  And then I do a Dane Cook search, and his videos are getting 600,000, 700,000 hits. 
[02:09:30]  I'm like, forget it.  Billy, watching that clip of Bill Burr was not only magnificent and classic, but I love  Bill's body language when he's getting abused.  He looks like one of those high-8, 1950s, high-speed home movies.  It's just like the same three moves over and over.  He should have a spatula in his hand and an awful hat on. 
[02:10:00]  Kiss the chef.  Well, I can't wait to get your new house, Dane, because I stay at his apartment in L.A.  now.  Upstairs in his bedroom, plasma, A.C., gorgeous.  He has a huge living room.  What do you expect him to have?  Cathedral ceilings downstairs where I sleep, nothing.  Just a big, because you want me to open the window?  It's like an 80-foot window with 80-foot curtains, so you either have the window open with the  breeze, and then in the morning, the sun craps on your face, or you just sweat all night 
[02:10:30]  with the shades closed.  He went and bought me a fan at Rite Aid.  Thanks, Dane.  Bobby, you sweat in the front row at an ice hockey game.  What are you talking about?  Oh, that's so funny.  Who wrote that for you, Jay Davis?  Oh, wow.  You know what?  I take that back, boss.  Yeah, you better.  Hey, that tourgasm, too.  It's boss.  I'm available after today.  You see what happened there?  Bob Kelly feeling very, very comfortable.  Yeah, I know.  Very comfortable.  For a split second, and then you realize who you were talking to. 
[02:11:00]  Hang on, boss.  I'm going to clean up those coattails after Saturday night for you.  Ouch.  I wouldn't mind if a couple tickets for SNL just happen to, I don't know, end up at  XM, by the way.  That would be real nice.  I got a couple seats.  I can hook it up.  Are you kidding?  No, seriously, I got a couple people who have bailed, so if you two want to go, then come down.  There goes my seats.  I will go in a second.  What, do I do this through Bob Kelly, your secretary?  No, those are my seats you're taking.  Oh, I take that back then.  He just dumped me out. 
[02:11:30]  A couple of people bailed, and he just meant you.  Well, then try to squeeze into one seat, you stupid.  I think, Bobby, aren't you on the road, isn't there, like a Chuckles down in Cuba?  No, actually, I'm doing tourgasm, you jackass.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It's your tour.  Yeah, so stop promoting.  Checks made payable, too.  Yeah, exactly.  Checks made payable.  Let's get on it.  How do you not promote your own?  I'm on the tour.  How do you tell me I'm in Chuckles?  Thank you.  No, it's the Bogota Atlantic City.  He's too busy.  He is busy. 
[02:12:00]  He's very busy.  He's gone from tourgasm.  He's got SNL and movies to promote.  It's a franchise like McDonald's for him now.  I went to his premiere in L.A., so I had to go.  He was with Jessica and millions of people around him, and I had to go.  Jay Davis grabs me at the front of the red carpet.  First of all, you say Jessica Simpson.  You have to say Jessica Simpson.  You don't say Jessica.  I've met her.  Yeah, but you can't just blurt it out like Jessica.  Dane calls her Jess.  Stop it.  You call her Jessica Simpson.  You say, like everyone else, Jessica Simpson. 
[02:12:30]  Actually, I have her number.  I'll call her now and ask her.  You want me to do that?  Stop it.  All right, you're right.  I have Jessica from junior high.  We called her the Blouse.  She was 300.  Either that or the White Lion.  What's her name?  The Blouse.  Hey, instant feedback going crazy.  I have no idea about this.  Anthony from Dallas.  It's effing the best.  Ask him if he has seen the Halo 2 mixed with his crazy guy at the office bid on YouTube.  I did see that.  It's pretty wild, man. 
[02:13:00]  What is it all about?  Somebody took Halo 2 graphics and they took one of my bids and then they, with the controller,  they made the guy move around and act out the entire bit.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, it's really good.  It's really too long and it's almost creepy.  They're making productions.  I've seen productions where it's an entire cast of characters that are from first-person  shooter games.  And they act out scenes.  They do plays. 
[02:13:30]  It's ridiculous how much time this must take.  Yeah, yeah.  No, this definitely took a long, long time.  It was pretty wild.  All right.  Hey, Dan, we really appreciate this.  We know you're rehearsing for SNL, but this was huge for us.  All right, fellows.  I'll take you up on those tickets if they're available.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Talk to Bobby.  Dude, can I have the tickets?  Yeah, dude.  I mean, don't get mine.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  All right.  SNL Saturday night, tomorrow night, obviously, and Employee of the Month starts next Friday.  You got it.  Dane Cook, thank you so much. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Later, guys.  All right.  Now we'll talk about what kind of blender does Jess have.  Yeah.  I actually, when I met her, I felt like such a jackass.  I just got these new guest jeans, like $300, but they had, on the back pockets, they had  leather tassels.  Oh, my God.  Why are you tasseling your ass?  I didn't do it.  They came with it.  My girl, before I left, goes, listen, B, please take the tassels off.  And I was like, why?  They're there.  They're supposed to, they're kind of cool, right? 
[02:14:30]  They're kind of like Old West type thing.  Right, yeah.  If you're going to LA, then you go, please just take the tassels off.  And I was like, no, I'm not taking that.  I went out there, dude.  I kind of stood up, and I heard her go, are those tassels?  Why is your security wearing tassels?  Hey, look at the time.  We have to end the show.  Oh, damn.  Or do we.  Or do we.  Pick your feet up.  You know what?  Let's sit back and relax.  You didn't even get into his new book yet.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:15:00]  We got so much to sell to do.  I want to hear about the new book.  New book of all.  What?  What?  He just got real comfortable.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Yeah.  What you heard was two feet going up on a desk.  Kick him back, relaxing, settling in for a spell.  Deal with it.  Getting back to Busting Vegas, the new book by Ben Mesrick.  Yeah.  Sorry, Ben, that you've had to wait about an hour and a half.  No, I love Dane.  It's awesome.  Yeah.  And I hope you're not even the real Ben Mesrick, and I hope you're his twin.  And I hope this interview we're doing is just fascinating. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  Oh, this is heated.  So what we have learned, Ben Mesrick's last book, Bringing Down the House, is going to be a movie with Kevin Spacey.  Yeah.  Highly recommend you pick up Bringing Down the House if you haven't read it yet.  So let's get into Busting Vegas, a true story of monumental excess, sex, love, violence, and beating the odds.  Beating the odds.  Yeah, it's a story about a guy named Semyon Dukacs who could get aces to come out when he wanted him to.  He hit Vegas and then went around the world and hit every casino across Europe before getting told at gunpoint in Monte Carlo that if he ever did it again, he'd be killed. 
[02:16:00]  And it's a wild story.  And if you want to know how to get aces to come out, it's really wild.  I mean, it's a neat thing.  It sounds impossible.  No, no, it's really doable.  Like, it sounds impossible.  You want to hear it?  You want to hear how to do it?  I'd love to, yeah.  Voss, shut up.  Shut up for a second.  All right, this is good.  You know how the dealer shuffles the cards?  Yeah.  And you play blackjack, he then rolls them over into a horizontal line like this, you know?  He's holding the back card with his hand here.  If you're sitting in the seat to his left, you can see the card, right? 
[02:16:30]  Right.  If that card happens to be an ace or a ten jack king or queen,  what you do is when then the dealer offers the cut card to someone,  you and your friends have the whole table.  Right.  You take the cut card, and you cut to exactly 100 cards from the bottom,  which sounds hard.  It sounds very hard.  Two hours a day for one week, and anybody can do this.  It's a real easy thing to do.  You cut to exactly 100 cards.  The dealer moves the front of the deck to the back.  Now the 101st card is an ace, and you know this because you saw the ace.  Come on, man.  So now they get away with that. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, they don't.  The casinos have no idea what you just did.  They didn't see.  They don't know there's an ace.  So then as you're playing, you just bet the minimum, bet the minimum, bet the minimum.  When the ace is lined up, you bet $10,000.  The guy next to you bets $8,000 in case you missed by one card.  The guy next to him bets $6,000, and you're going to get that ace.  In about an hour, you're supposed to get two or three aces or five or six,  ten jack kings or queen, which is also a huge advantage.  You can win $100,000, $150,000 in an hour.  The thing is you get kicked out fast because you're betting $10,000, $100, whatever,  and then suddenly you're betting $10,000. 
[02:17:30]  Right, and a good card comes out.  And we were at the Wynn doing this, and there's two security guards immediately out of nowhere.  But the thing is that you'd come in like a – he used to pretend he was like a European pop star.  He'd come in with a leather shirt and no shirt, no T-shirt on, singing in German,  have two girls on his arms like groupies.  Or he'd come in – he used to pretend he was this Russian arms dealer.  So you could get away with making these huge bets.  And it's a wild story.  And then he went all across Europe, and eventually that's where it gets dangerous because that's still the mob.  The mob runs all the casinos in Europe. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So Vegas is not really mobbed up anymore, but Europe is.  But you would think the casinos would figure out this ace trick and work around that.  Well, now that – since the book came out, they figured –  You wrecked it for everybody.  Well, you know what?  It's still doable, and I've watched it done recently.  I'm sure not everybody.  Because casinos don't think that anybody can really do it and is going to practice.  You know what?  Most of the people who read my books, read it on the flight to Vegas.  I always see them reading it then, and I'm thinking that's the worst time to read my book.  I mean, you can read it then, but don't land and think, okay, I'm going to go cut to aces now.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  You've got to practice a lot.  It takes a lot of practice.  But, yeah, the casinos know about it now, and they still don't cover that back card that well.  You know, it's still very doable.  And it's legal.  It's all legal.  It's a great show on all that taking – cheating in Vegas where people are capping bets and pulling out.  Oh, yeah.  Like, guys pulling out their bet after they see the cards they have, and the dealer doesn't have a clue.  They're changing their bet.  They're, like, switching.  Like, all of a sudden, they'll have a good hand.  Well, that's great at that.  And then, bam, they're throwing a black chip on top. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  You know what the most successful cheating thing ever was?  It was a team, and what they had is they had made a stack of $5 chips.  A plastic that was hollowed out, and the dealer was working with them, and they'd lose a stack of $5 chips.  And the dealer would fill it with $100 chips.  Yeah.  And then they'd win a stack of five $5 chips, but it was really $500.  And they did this all day long, and they ended up taking about $7 million in two days or something.  Just pulling $100.  And they eventually got caught.  Of course. 
[02:19:30]  You know, but the stuff in Busting Vegas is all legal.  It's like, you can't go to jail, but the casinos come after you.  So, you know, there's a scene where he gets handcuffed to a chair in Caesar's Palace.  There's a scene in Aruba.  He's banned from the island of Aruba.  He was taken at one point out of the island because he had won a bunch there.  So it's pretty wild stuff to do.  Do they mess you up in the back room?  Well, the back room is the one room where there's no cameras, you know.  But nowadays, it's not like they put your head in a vice anymore.  Because, you know, Vegas is like Disney World now.  They made me pop your eye out.  Right. 
[02:20:00]  They're not going to do that anymore.  But they will intimidate you.  Two big guys, they get into your personal space.  They have you stand against a wall in the back.  They make you take photographs.  And then they make you sign something that says you'll never come back.  That's all that Vegas will do.  Atlantic City, I've heard stories about the parking lots and stuff.  Yeah.  Which is a little more seedy.  Yeah.  And then overseas, it's definitely not a good idea to do any of this stuff.  And the Indian casinos will skin you, right?  The Indian casinos, you know, they have their own ball there.  That's what the lamps are made up.  They'll do that.  These guys hit Indian casinos all the time.  But you don't want to get caught there because they have the tribal council. 
[02:20:30]  You're not really sure what that's going to be.  What the hell could that possibly be?  I don't know.  Wow.  Wow.  Your head on a stake outside the place.  They're going to play lacrosse, right?  They're going to play lacrosse with your head afterwards.  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Opie, you put your feet up on that desk at 9 o'clock.  You're my hero.  I'm a hero.  And to that fiesta with those dopey bozos.  I love you.  I'm going to buy XM for everybody I meet for the next 15 minutes.  I swear to God. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're amazing.  Thank you, bro.  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  What up?  What's up?  I've got to tell you the truth, man.  I'm a JV and Elvis.  Get off the goddamn air.  No.  You're that Anthony guy that called yesterday?  Dude, see they hang up.  Here's what happened.  And he called their show yesterday twice.  Yes.  They had to get him to call twice to give them compliments on their show.  And meanwhile, instead of hanging on, and he could have said whatever he wanted, let 
[02:21:30]  it be known he hung up.  Because we don't hang up on that.  Justin in the Bronx.  We don't want to bash us.  We're giving away tickets on the walkover today, right?  Yes.  I hate my name now.  What tickets again?  Because it's the same as his.  Hey, Justin, what's up?  Call me Kathy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I was just wondering when this guy's book's coming out.  Yeah, when's the book coming out, Ben?  Busting Vegas is out in paperback.  Hulk!  Right now.  That's the one all up.  Hulk!  Hulk!  Justin in the Bronx!  Jimmy!  Hulk! 
[02:22:00]  Keep calling.  I love it.  When is the book coming out?  You guys should stay here all day.  Oh, we just might.  Those guys are idiots.  It's like the show after ER complaining if ER ran 20 minutes over.  It would be the happiest people in the world if ER ran over.  Does anyone know what the show is after ER?  Exactly.  No, I couldn't tell you.  Well, you know what?  I made those comparisons yesterday, and I got smashed for it.  Oh, really?  Okay?  Well, he made a good one.  You made awful ones.  If you guys were in front of me, I would let you guys stay on for half the show, right? 
[02:22:30]  I mean, it's crazy.  Yeah.  They're crazy.  Come on.  I'm keeping your book.  All right, yeah.  All right.  Ben Mesrick, Busting Vegas is the new book.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Gigantor.  We got tickets to Gigantor we're giving away on the walkover.  So if you're outside the building right now, you just get handed tickets.  It's Megadeth and Lamb of God and a bunch of other bands at the PNC tomorrow night.  I'm going to SNL.  You better give me those tickets.  Dude, I already hooked it up.  You're getting – yes, you're going.  Wow.  I'm going to be at the Borgata in front of 18 people because Dane's not there. 
[02:23:00]  He's doing SNL.  You know what?  Bob Kelly is amazing.  You had a great set in Cleveland, by the way.  Thank you, man.  Rich had a great set in Cleveland.  And you're playing the Borgata with Jay Davis.  Borgata tonight.  And go to my MySpace, MySpace, Robert Kelly Live.  I got 35 dates.  We're coming 35 cities across the country with this tourgasm thing.  And it's a good show.  I'm not going to lie.  If you haven't seen Gary or Bob – I haven't seen Jay, so I don't know.  But Gary and Bobby are tremendous.  Boss, what are you promoting?  You can get my – you see my DVD on Amazon.com.  Guaranteed you'll like it. 
[02:23:30]  When you walked in the room, did you recognize me?  Didn't you like –  Yeah, yeah.  Did you recognize Bobby or me?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I recognized you.  Okay.  What about me?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I recognize you.  Yeah, now I recognize you because I didn't see you because of the hat first.  Right, right.  There you go.  Don't try to throw me under the bus under a compliment.  No, no.  Of course I recognize you.  Thank you.  Amazon.com.  I recognize Dane.  All right, listen.  Yeah, well.  Recognize his stove?  Today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH. 
[02:24:00]  All right?  I guess we'll end here.  Yeah, we'll go over.  You choose when you end, right, Opie?  Yes, absolutely.  And yes, Mark, I saw the notes.  Please get off the air.  I saw every one of them.  But don't take it out on fan.  Thanks, Bob Kelly.  Thanks, Rich Voss.  Thank you.  Thanks, Ben Mesrick.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  If you're not joining us, have a great weekend.  Or go somewhere else.  Maybe you like classic rock.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Where could our listeners go now?  Kind of sucks that New York Radio blows.  For an hour?  Yeah, check out.  No?  No.  What?  Oh, Whoopi's still 10.  Go check out Whoopi Goldberg.  See what she's all about.  Thanks, guys.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:25:00]  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Ah!  Yeah.  Whoa.  That was primal.  Nice.  Out on the streets of New York.  What's up, dude?  Look at what we're looking at.  I just heard a dude.  Hi, sweetie.  How are you?  Nice to see you.  Bob Kelly signing autographs.  Yeah, he's famous.  What do we got in front of us, Anthony?  You know a little more about this than me.  This is a beautiful Ford GT. 
[02:25:30]  I took a ride in one the other day, and I was doing about 110 down the West Side Highway  in New York.  You really can't go that fast in New York because there are too many lights.  Right.  But you open it up.  It's not the Mustang, not Shelby GT.  It's the Ford GT.  This thing is a monster.  A monster.  What's up, guys?  How are you doing, man?  Morning. 
[02:26:00]  How's it going?  Are you hitting any potholes in that thing today?  Yeah, you know, it's not the holes.  It's those steel plates in the street.  Yeah, the plates.  Oh, they're wrecking wheels.  You really don't get much clearance.  I've done one of these plus 11.1 grams, right?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Maybe a little more than that, too.  Oh, I'm talking about the price.  Could be $5,000 for that.  Can you take that on a ski trip?  Because ski season's right around the corner.  I just had some guy offer me $220,000 for it.  Wow.  That's more than I paid for it.  You just said, I'll pay you $220,000 for it? 
[02:26:30]  Sky rolled up.  He's like, how much is that car?  I said, $220,000.  I said, how much did you pay for it?  And I said, $180,000.  Do you own it?  Yes.  Do I own it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  Your Coke must be good.  Now, on the wet road, a little rough.  You've got to watch out.  It's a little rough, a lot of power.  We're on our way, actually, to go buy a couple of more sweet cars for the club.  Are you?  We're going through town, so we thought we'd say hi.  Yeah.  My battery's going. 
[02:27:00]  Is it for your mic battery or your headphone battery?  I had a great line, and the battery went right as I said it.  Damn it.  It's good.  Something about him being a Coke dealer.  Forget it.  A Coke dealer.  Maybe that saved my life.  What is the car?  Everyone can hear you.  What's the matter?  You need to eat.  If you're going to, yeah.  So what's the car club all about?  This is a private club.  We have one in New York, London.  We're going to be in L.A., Miami this year.  And you join the club and drive all of our cars.  We have supercars like this. 
[02:27:30]  We have vintage cars like Shelby Cobra's.  What's the deal, though?  You rent them for a weekend or something?  No, I take them for up to a week.  You don't rent them, though.  If you're a member, you just call them.  So you want to take the Aston Martin for the weekend.  You set it up.  You take it out.  And then a lot of guys take it and, you know, they pick up chicks.  Yeah.  They think they have the hot cars.  They're all chick magnets.  Yeah.  We do a lot of events, like tomorrow, going dirt bike racing with our members and stuff.  There's a bar there, so there's always something going on at night, which is fun.  How cool is that, man?  I know.  How fast do you have that thing up to? 
[02:28:00]  186 miles an hour on the 95.  That's one of those, that's like, really gets you scared at that speed.  Because anything could happen mechanically, on the road, your self-human error, and it  would be over like that in itself.  But there's like an old guy in a jalopy a mile ahead of you.  And you have to start braking, because you're going to be at a mile.  And he's going to look down the road and, oh, there's plenty of room for me to turn out.  And you're on him in a second.  You've got to be careful about that. 
[02:28:30]  You smash the back over here.  So you might as well go in something like that.  Dude, you smash the back.  Does Ford make that car?  That's what you mentioned.  Hey, Bob, what are you saying?  You smash the back.  You know there's a big piece taken out of the bottom of the car, right?  Right underneath.  Look, there's a big piece taken out of the bottom.  Bobby bit it.  Let me see, Bob.  Right there, look.  That big chunk.  Oh, you're...  What?  No, actually, there's something missing over there.  I swear to God.  What happens if I take that out?  I'm a member of the club, and something like that happens.  Do I got to pay?  No, I'd kill you.  No, we cover insurance for everybody. 
[02:29:00]  Can Jews join the club?  No.  No Jews?  No Jews join the club.  That's it.  I mean, we cover it with the insurance.  We take care of the food.  All right.  Yeah, so they could wreck it.  Why don't we have a car better than renting?  A slamming car.  Hey, maybe you could go in there and lay down a little rubber.  I know the street's wet, but...  All right, we'll start walking.  Can I lay down a little rubber?  The street doesn't have to be wet, my man.  Oh, I know that.  It's worse if it's wet, but...  That's what it's for.  It's really just for burnout.  I'm being a jerk.  That's all.  It'll be more than a half.  All right.  It's starting to rain, so we're going to walk. 
[02:29:30]  Make it easy, man.  How better I want to see a bus smash into that car right now?  I was thinking that, too.  Oh, God, that would be great.  Ha, ha.  Goddamn rich kids.  Right when you open the door, a cab takes it off.  I know.  How happy would that make me?  What?  He pulls out and a bus hits him?  Yeah.  Is he going to...  What's he going to do?  Burn rubber in traffic?  He's got to get a couple of Asians out of his way.  Look at that.  Why do you?  Just run them over.  And then he's going to take off.  Look at that.  Come on. 
[02:30:00]  Get out of his way.  What are they doing?  They're going to try to do something with us?  Yeah, they're going to burn rubber.  He's going to take off.  He's going to do it?  Oh.  Wow.  He's got to be going five miles an hour.  Oh.  That's the best you can do in...  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my dick just got hard.  I want to fuck him.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That two thing's a monster.  I feel like I'm at Revere Beach.  Wow.  Yeah.  I remember Revere Beach back in the day.  I'm going to get a clam roll and watch that asshole burn out. 
[02:30:30]  Go fuck yourself.  I hope you smash into a fucking bus.  I know.  I'll hit somebody.  Anthony, is that the car you have?  No.  I have the Shelby GT500.  It's a Mustang, but it's, you know, Shelby Mustang.  500 horsepower.  Wow.  Supercharged.  Wow.  That's powerful, right?  Is this lady a spy?  It is ridiculous.  I love it.  What happened?  What happened?  We just walked by. 
[02:31:00]  Keith, if you open that umbrella, I'm going to shove it up your ass.  It's barely a fucking drizzle out.  I'm talking.  That's what it is.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Rich is talking behind Opie.  He's got to protect the back of Opie's head.  That guy had the worst posture ever.  Yeah.  Do you see that?  Adam's family.  Kenny would be so upset.  I don't care if it's just a sprinkle.  GH gets an umbrella.  There's a man who opens an umbrella. 
[02:31:30]  What's the word again?  Way.  I'm going to have to hear it again.  Why not?  Way.  It's my favorite.  Ooh.  Ooh, it's tinkling out.  It is nasty.  Yuck.  It's horrible.  It's getting ready to downpour.  Yeah.  Not a pleasant walkover.  Bill Boggs.  Yep.  Bill Boggs.  How you doing, sir?  He's in a wreck.  No.  I saw him yesterday. 
[02:32:00]  Is that Bill Boggs?  Because it looks...  I think Bill Boggs is even older than him, though, now.  Celebrity lookalike.  I know.  Do you ever do that when you're just sitting around?  Like, when I get on a plane, I'll sit and name...  The game is everyone that comes in, no matter who it is, you've got to pick a celebrity  they look like.  Yeah, it makes time go by.  Let's go.  Thank you, guys.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, that's it.  Okay, nice.  No celebrity, yeah.  Sure.  Anyone watch The Biggest Loser?  Yeah, I did all morning. 
[02:32:30]  You're sitting across from me.  I was going to say that one, but I already smashed you too many times.  I had to get your back.  You really were...  Oh, yeah.  Hey, thanks for getting Dane Cook to call us, by the way, Bob.  We couldn't get that done.  Yeah, getting your famous friends to call in.  Wait, say friend.  But you're my famous friend, too, dummy.  No.  Yeah, I'm sure Dane asks you to get us to call him.  Roland goes, we can't get him until next week.  Really?  Yeah.  That's probably some publicist dummy. 
[02:33:00]  No, he wanted to call in.  He told me.  Very cool.  Ooh.  What's on the board?  Rod Stewart, still the same.  Great rock classics of our time.  How about you write a new song, Rod?  Beastie men?  Oh, this girl right here.  Look at the Beastie men.  They're all gray.  How hot is Fergie?  When did that happen?  Fergie is ridiculous.  And then we mentioned this yesterday.  Sean Lennon's new album, new CD and DVD is called Friendly Fire.  Dude, did you see the Beastie Boys?  What happened? 
[02:33:30]  To be called the Beastie Boys still, they weren't thinking ahead.  They must have thought it would be a goof that would last a couple of months.  Because this Beastie Boy is all gray.  Yeah, the gray beard's got to go.  Hey, here comes my old therapist.  I swear to God, this guy with the two dogs is my old analyst.  Mr. Whipple.  I'm not kidding you.  Are you kidding?  What's up, Carl?  Oh, this is...  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  I've got advice from this clown.  What are you doing?  Look at this guy.  What's going on?  Nice to see you. 
[02:34:00]  What's going on?  I'm on the radio right now with O.B. and Anthony.  Watch out for these dogs.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not even kidding.  He's dressed like a German.  These dogs are the one...  What are they called again?  Chows.  Oh, yeah.  He used to bring this one in when we do a therapy session.  It would growl at me and scare me the whole time.  And it helped, right?  Yeah, it helped me.  It helped me fire you and get a new one.  He looks like he should be on Dancing with the Stars.  He looks like he should be what?  Dancing with the Stars.  He is a...  Did you help Bob out, though?  He's standing now, right? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, he's still standing.  Yeah, obviously you helped him.  He's 70 pounds overweight.  I'm sure that's not...  No, when I was with him, I actually lost weight, actually.  You subscribe to the last man standing.  And there is success.  As long as they're still standing.  That's right.  You realize, Bob, you bought that tie for him.  But that guy didn't buy that tie.  No, you didn't.  I couldn't afford that tie.  He gave me a deal.  I think you guys should make fashion statements.  Oh, no!  Oh!  Oh!  You got it!  Oh!  It was more of a financial statement on Bob's behalf. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, dude, watch out for these dogs.  You don't know if you can't think.  Tom Patrice down.  All right, the dogs are getting mad, so...  All right, Carl.  It was nice seeing you, man.  Take care.  What a coincidence.  Pretty high-strung for an analyst.  Jesus.  Actually, I was making fun of the fact that Bob spent money and bought the guy's tie.  I wasn't even making fun of the tie.  Perhaps that guy ought to see somebody.  You guys want to do invisible window today?  I think we got in trouble for invisible window last time.  No, we didn't.  Okay, invisible window.  Look at this window.  It looks like it's not there, right? 
[02:35:30]  Sir?  No, you're playing in the glass.  Yeah, you got to knock on this.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  And then you go, is this?  And then you go...  Is that glass?  That one?  Is it right here?  But that...  Is your cock as big as...  Oh, that's...  I see that.  Hey, piano cock.  Oh, here's the lady again.  Oh, there's the lady.  Is she mad?  She might be.  Oh, my God.  She knows how to spell everything.  We called her, I think, a cunt.  Jesus.  But no one heard it because there's glass here. 
[02:36:00]  It's soundproof.  It looks like there's no glass here.  It looks like there's no glass.  That's the invisible glass bit.  They don't want to play today.  Which is a great visual.  They might have seen themselves on YouTube and they're not happy.  I can't believe I just found my analyst.  The guy wanted us to come in and talk to him.  I doubt it.  Yeah.  All right.  You need a Steinway yet for your apartment, Oak?  Huh?  That's Steinway.  Do you have something in a black mold?  How about I need an apartment?  Let's start there.  Oh, this guy's going to be happy Jimmy's not here today. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In front of him.  All right.  Wow.  What time is it already?  My God.  We must have run late over there at the FM studios, huh?  It's a door right there.  Morning.  Danny.  Good morning, sir.  Good morning.  We'll see you guys up there.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Massican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance. 
[02:37:00]  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  The jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[02:37:30]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:38:00]  Cheers, though. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  That elevator ride was fun, and Jimmy isn't even here.  I thought it was going to be a boring elevator ride, but Rich Voss laid out a picture-perfect  fart in a full elevator.  Sounded like he shit his pants.  With strangers in there and everything.  And everyone, we didn't even try to keep quiet with the laughing this time.  Like yesterday, Jimmy farted, and we were all snickering.  But this time, it was just a big, loud boss fart, and everyone just started laughing hysterically. 
[02:39:00]  And the second that door started to open, we all just ran to get out of it, out of embarrassment.  It was wet sounding.  It was an awful, awful...  It had so much vibration to it, he shook his glasses off his head.  It didn't reverberate.  I was afraid the cable was going to snap on the elevator.  Holy Jesus, you are a mess.  Poor guy's suit collar flapped up.  Yeah, and there was some, like, real businessman-type guys in there.  I didn't think Jimmy's could be topped from yesterday, but congrats, boss. 
[02:39:30]  Very wet.  You have the best elevator fart.  Fart of the day.  Brought to you by Bodog.  Who's sponsoring the elevator fart of the day?  Jesus.  It's soup.  Soup, soup, soup.  How did you not know what it was?  It's soup.  Yeah, right?  Blindfolded, you should be able to tell.  Listen, a fat man's trying to nonchalantly say, mmm, food.  Give me some. 
[02:40:00]  Stop calling me out.  That's not a...  What is that?  That's a...  Could I have some?  Oh, look at that.  Something to put on my cupcake.  Soup.  I don't think I could eat anything in here, though, because every time I'm in this place,  I just visualized the disgusting things I've seen.  It is really disgusting.  Pat from Nunnaki's ass.  It is hard to eat in here, yeah.  It's just weird as things.  Because it's the same disgusting place.  Oh, no.  Yeah, you're sitting where some, like, Twado, like fucking Sandy Cain's genital wart was  right in that area, and now you're going to eat there. 
[02:40:30]  No, I'm not.  Not now.  Not now.  I'm not going to eat red beef stew after you just talked about Twado.  Doesn't the end one look like what was moving through that woman's hernia?  Just pulsating through her, keeping her alive.  Looks like an old tool video.  What?  What do you want?  Oh, I thought that was a brownie.  Yeah.  A brownie.  No, seriously.  Can I have what's inside there?  There's a little...  There's bread and there's a truffle.  That's wonderful.  Oh, you're passing me the banana because I should eat the banana, right, Keith? 
[02:41:00]  Hey, where's my yogurt?  Thanks.  They're screwing up by the numbers.  Yeah.  Without Kenny being here, I wouldn't have forgot my yogurt.  I feel weird.  Kenny would come in and be like, hey, what can I get you, sir?  I forgot my club soda over there.  Am I allowed to take it now?  Because club soda Kenny eats usually.  What is this for?  Me?  Wow.  Just to play.  Just to play.  Wow.  Mashups from who?  Uh, E-Roc.  Wow.  Oh, God.  No, it looks like it's, once again, the subtlety in the pass the buck that I just saw from 
[02:41:30]  the band, it was so subtle.  Ah, E-Roc gave it to me.  Hey, uh, funny bones.  Love it.  You're a pro.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, Anthony?  Those shit tics just made fun of you as soon as they went on air.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah?  When they finally got on air.  Yeah, well, yeah, when they finally got on air.  They were complaining about that, too.  And some guy named Mark was telling them to drop it, drop it.  And then they said how they were scared that the pest, when they left the studio yesterday, 
[02:42:00]  that they were scared of the pest attacking them.  They said, uh, what's the call?  He was carrying a scissor or some crap like that.  So, keep up the fight, man.  I'm going to go knock the message board again.  All right.  Thank you.  If he's scared of the pest, he should just carry a treadmill.  They'll back off.  We're, uh, whatever.  We're done with those asses.  We did our thing.  They had their moment.  Oh, man.  We forgot to do that.  We had a lot of, uh, stuff.  A man attempts to light X on fire.  That's good.  That does sound good. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  What was the other thing?  The other thing?  The other thing?  Attempts, though.  Sounds like he didn't do it.  That's not good.  He failed in his mission in setting his X on fire?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, we were getting into this.  Xs aren't flammable unless you put something on them.  We were starting this, and then all hell broke loose.  I forgot what happened, but...  We were actually into something?  Yeah, I forgot what fight we were into.  What?  J.B. and Elvis, part one of today's rant?  Yeah.  What do they say?  Anything worth it?  Same.  Same crap? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, forget it.  They're done.  The CD player is jammed.  Ugh.  All right, we're settling in.  We dragged Ben along with us.  I just followed you.  I'm like that guy who falls asleep on your couch and won't leave.  It's just the crowd of people walking.  You might as well join them, right?  Yeah, cool.  That was a nice crowd today, considering it's a crappy day in New York.  Yeah, that's crazy.  So, do you ever feel nervous walking down there like that with all this?  They were told to drop it because you guys pulled a stern and had a gag order.  See, that's the shit. 
[02:43:30]  Gag order?  We did not have anything to do with them being...  Gag order?  They can say whatever they want.  If their boss tells them to shut up, we sure didn't tell Mark to tell them to shut up.  Say whatever you want.  It's the old, if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it.  Philosophy.  That's what sucks about radio.  That's what sucks about radio.  They'll claim that and there's no proof.  Yeah, we put a gag order on them. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, Howard admitted it himself.  Yeah.  Justified what we were saying for a couple of years.  But they could say whatever they wanted.  No.  There's no proof.  They could say whatever they want.  We didn't tell anybody.  There's no accountability.  They know they're just lying through their teeth.  J.V. and Elvis are trashing you guys again.  Trashing the past, saying that they are all computer geeks.  Saying the last good show was in 2002.  Jimmy is out in Pittsburgh doing Slurpees, whatever that means, and that Ann has an ugly face.  What hacks?  Oh, no. 
[02:44:30]  Two men don't find me attractive.  Shit.  That upsets me so much when men don't find me attractive.  I would like to know, if you don't find me attractive, what men do you find attractive?  J.V. and Elvis?  Elvis, which one?  Is that why you're drinking?  Because you can't handle your homosexuality?  Is that the problem?  J.V. or Elvis?  Whichever one is which?  I think you look stoic.  Thank you, sir.  Very stoic.  Yes.  Good looking man.  Let's say hi to Chris. 
[02:45:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing today?  Hey.  Those two retops over there are just trashing you guys about how you have no ratings in certain markets  and how Anthony's face looks like a dog's ass.  No ratings.  Oh, that upsets me so much when a man doesn't find me attractive.  Well, they're having fun at the Javits Center.  I guess they're broadcasting live down there today.  Yeah.  Must be hack week at the Javits Center.  All right.  Thank you.  Is it Failed Jock Expo 2006? 
[02:45:30]  It's the future expo.  Is that what's going on over there?  It's the future expo.  Future expo.  You might want to look into the crystal ball for what's going to happen to you guys.  Let's go into your fucking future.  I see unemployment.  I see the doghouse empty.  Oh, please.  The doghouse.  The hacks.  The hacks.  Doghouse.  Just stop.  Whoa.  Monsters in the morning. 
[02:46:00]  I can't believe they said you have an ugly face.  What guy would say that?  Who cares?  What are we in kindergarten?  Ugly face.  Shut up.  I wake up every morning and look in the mirror.  I know what I look like.  There are people that don't find me attractive.  And, you know, there are people that do.  If JV and Elvis doesn't, I got no problem with that.  That is like the...  I can't even give a number to how concerned I am on the list of number one concern and down. 
[02:46:30]  I don't even think it comes up to a number.  That has been invented.  Where my concern lies, whether I'm attractive to JV and Elvis.  And obviously it means they find Opie attractive because they didn't say anything about Opie.  So now Opie, JV and Elvis find attractive.  Right.  Yet I, they find ugly.  Opie.  What's the Slurpee thing in Pittsburgh?  I don't get that.  I guess they think he's playing some crap hole in Pittsburgh. 
[02:47:00]  He's not doing my business.  No.  I said, Rich is here.  Let's go to Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Listen, dude, these guys are like trashing the shit out of you on the radio.  Like, they're talking like a whole bunch of shit.  Like, it's ridiculous.  Who's there to hear it?  Well, I'm here on my desk in my office right now because my XM unit crapped out so I can't  listen to you guys.  Yeah.  But I was like, you know, I heard the replay yesterday and I'm like, all right, you know,  let me check these guys out.  And, you know, I've never heard of them.  Let me check them out. 
[02:47:30]  I'm sitting there and listening to them and they fucking suck.  They are horrible.  They are horrible.  We're only doing them a favor right now and I hate doing them a favor because their ratings  are so awful, so abysmal that the, well, why don't you tell it?  Yeah, I'll just sit here.  Go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  You talk.  See, that was Jimmy's bit, ladies and gentlemen.  Jimmy, it's Slurpees in Philly.  I apologize.  But you guys, man, you guys are awesome.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Let's get into some more show. 
[02:48:00]  Man Attempts to Light X on Fire.  We were going to play this about two or three days ago at this point.  Here it is.  I don't condone this, but I understand.  But I understand.  What happened?  Any bad stories from your marriage near the end?  Oh.  Where you want to do something stupid?  No.  You have kids, though.  No, I don't want to.  No, she can't.  You can't set the mother on fire or the children.  No, she's doing ass bread in my head.  I'm not saying any of that.  No, no.  A little revenge action?  No, no, no.  Not at all. 
[02:48:30]  There's a nice divorce?  No, I went with a girl who wants to put a restraining order on me.  I wanted to just take her out.  But my ex-wife is cool.  She's always been cool with me.  We've always been cool.  Fascinating.  I love those stories.  We're still great friends, are you?  Yeah.  She cleans my house.  I got kids.  Is she Mexican?  That's ridiculous.  What are you going to do?  Fight with her for 18 years until your kids are growing up?  Do you just leave jizz-stained towels around for her to pick up?  Yeah, and I was tagging someone last night, and... 
[02:49:00]  What is this?  Hold on.  Alex in Dallas.  Alex!  Yes, how's it going?  What's up, Alex?  I was just calling, because 105.3, the Jagger show, is talking shit, saying you guys are arrogant,  and you guys should be blessed, and Howard Stern, he moved up in the rankings, and you  guys just took over, and I don't think they know that the other show is talking shit to 
[02:49:30]  you guys, you know?  Do you got audio of this?  Maybe he's friends with J.B.  They're not talking about it right now.  I'm listening to it, but...  All right.  If they start talking about that, let us know, okay?  All right.  It's...  You know what?  It's real tough to be the big boys.  It's tough to be the top gun in town, because there's always the people that want to come  and have a little shootout with you to get a little attention, to get a name for themselves,  and unfortunately, you know, fortunately for us, but unfortunately, we're now the IT show. 
[02:50:00]  We're the show.  Yeah, it means we made it, I guess.  Stern went over to Sirius.  He's got a handful of fucking listeners.  God bless.  Have fun.  You got a great paycheck, whatever.  But as far as terrestrial radio goes, we're now the guys.  We're the top of the pyramid.  We're the guys that go on Letterman.  We're, you know, IT.  So we're going to get shit.  That's what's going to happen.  It comes with the territory.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  We did not put a gag order on anyone. 
[02:50:30]  I'll get Mark Turnoff on the radio on Monday to prove it.  If I have to have Club Soda Kenny drag his ass into the studio.  There's no gag order.  Gag order?  They're talking about us.  Why put a gag order on someone that's going to get booted out the door anyway any minute now?  I know for a fact Mark Turnoff went in and told him to shut the fuck up yesterday, and they did.  Certainly did.  Like good little boys.  I know that happened, but we had nothing to do with it.  And I'll prove it on Monday.  I'll drag Mark's ass right into the studio.  And make him speak. 
[02:51:00]  If one of the bosses tell them to shut up, it certainly wasn't us telling the boss that.  I'll get Joel Hollander on the phone to prove that we did not throw a gag order on anyone.  Don't you worry.  We'll take care of that on Monday.  Daryl from Chicago.  What's up?  Good morning, shit dicks.  I got an advertising update for you guys here.  And CKG is actually spending some money.  They put the commercial on TV with the chick with the big fat ass, which is hilarious, mind you.  And the billboards.  And you guys aren't that ugly.  I don't know what these guys are talking about.  So I think you guys are cute. 
[02:51:30]  Have a great day.  Punch it up.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug, what's up?  This is just the situation I was waiting for.  Right now you've got two shows that are talking crap about you guys.  And we have two message boards now with pests.  So I send out the invitation.  Wackbag, you guys pick one show.  FBA will pick the other.  And let's see who gets more calls through.  Oh, by the way, we have already called out in the tank.  You guys go have fun. 
[02:52:00]  I heard you shut down message boards and websites yesterday.  Yeah.  We have a friendly competition between the message boards.  Let's see who can fuck up the show to work.  We love that our pests are what they say, like computer geeks.  They say that.  Yeah.  Who do you think wins in the battles on radio and over the computers and phones and whatever else there is?  Yeah.  They're geeks.  Watch.  Shut your ass right down.  FullblownAids.com or OAExperience.com. 
[02:52:30]  And Whackbag.com is going to go ahead and pick one of the shows, and we're going to start destroying.  Yeah.  You know, personally, I would like to see Whackbag and FBA get along.  I mean, it's so stupid.  Yeah.  This is a friendly, like, competition thing.  No, there's other websites that don't get along.  They've got their own thing going, and, you know, that's why we don't pay attention to them anymore because they're not fan sites anymore.  But I would like to see Whackbag and FBA get along in the end.  And this is a friendly competition that benefits what the show stands for. 
[02:53:00]  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  We promote all fan sites, but when a website becomes less a fan site and becomes something else that has more bashing going on than fan-ness.  Than fan-ness.  Thank you.  Than fan-ness.  Then there's no reason we should support that website.  There's so many others that, you know, deserve to be supported.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get into man attempts to light X on fire after the break. 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  All right.  Everybody talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  I know I'm a loser.  You're a jerk-off.  A douche.  You effing tool.  I'm a tool.  I'm a dumb twat.  Okay, pathetic.  Someone just shoot me in the head. 
[02:54:00]  Back to you, Opie.  Hey, everyone.

[02:56:30]  all they deserve barsky has a sense of humor he gets it he's not all yeah he's not all pissed off  that he had to start a show late yesterday or today exactly he understands the uh the end game  the same paycheck he understands the end game he understands that uh you know we we leave them  with a you know a huge audience when you're having a show like yesterday or today yeah now i'm getting  more info uh jagger is on the same station we're on in dallas and he's pissed off that we went late i  guess oh look here's the deal here's the deal it's really simple instead of talking shit

[02:59:30]  fucking yeah lots of blowjobs though there's a lot of blowjobs and the word anal was only used  ten times how come you barely she has no accent hey how come you barely even have like this  accent on one of every 20 words i'm from new york and i've lived here for 30 years  and all the cocks in our mouths 30 years accent wait wait wait john and jersey ew jagger show is  the jagger mafia talk about wishing they were in the york i must say as well can i say something  else the jagger mafia please hold we are still getting over the fact that jagger show is called

[03:00:30]  have a cock in your mouth so we can say something now what the name of the book is what it's called  the butcher the baker the candlestick maker why would you name a sex book that because that's  all the people she's fucked my mom said to me after i fucked a baker she said to me now all you need  the butcher and a candlestick maker and you'll be all set and i said uh the butcher's probably not  going to be a problem but you know really i just need a candlestick i don't need a candlestick maker  wow man this should be on the new york times bestseller list i don't know yeah i'm hoping yeah 
[03:01:00]  what's the most guys you banged in the night uh i sucked off six guys once in a grope room that  was fun you sucked you blew six guys no say sucked off that turns me on more yeah what's a what's a  grope room um it's a room where it's pitch black except for what you're sucking off which has got

[03:09:30]  you guys are talking about us today is there a problem or well we tried we were talking about  hang on hang on we were trying to call jv and elvis but we were told that they're not allowed  to take calls about the fight you guys had well that's that's uh that's not true we'll prove it  on monday because i'll drag mark turnoff's ass into the studio to to prove it okay because i was  going to say that our turnoff told them to stop talking about us yesterday we've never told anyone  to stop talking about us and like good boys they stopped talking about us that's not our problem  we had nothing to do with it okay well i'm glad you clarified that because i was going to say that 
[03:10:00]  would be the biggest hypocritic move ever because that's one of the things that you bash on stern  about yeah exactly i mean there's there's no we would say whatever you want our history never put a  gag order on anybody for itself we've taken on everybody all right well thanks we had eight  minutes of content this past hour because uh you guys ran so late yeah well we've never had a  problem with you have we jagger no no not at all but i'm just saying it's a bit of the past couple  of days that's all did you um did you guys uh sorry there's been some collateral damage because  that's exactly what we were definitely you know is collateral damage are you guys uh friends with 
[03:10:30]  jv and elvis i'm assuming no no we don't even know the guy okay all right no we don't know them now  jagger you've worked in new york you've been around the block man you know radio okay let me ask you  something seriously okay go ahead you know yesterday what did you guys um go with our show  yesterday yeah it was on oh no i mean when we went late yeah now do you understand why we went late  yesterday because of the uh situation at the hospital with anthony's girlfriend was that compelling  radio what was it compelling radio i didn't that's one of the other guys clarify that that's mondo 
[03:11:00]  not only that but it's like y'all didn't even really talk about that i mean i know i guess it  was discussed but i don't i don't i think you guys just did your regular stuff i didn't think it was  really the discussion of what was going on with anthony's girlfriend and no i didn't think it was  that compelling that i had to say riveted to the radio wow really an honest truth you want me to  no i i respect you for telling the truth but what do what do you consider like compelling radio if not 
[03:11:30]  like somebody on the other personal life and things like that like what what do you consider  maybe an example of compelling radio well uh the most compelling was when jim norton went to that  yankees uh benefit thing that that was pretty he trashed uh jeter for like an hour yeah that now  that we're talking hysterical yeah that's fun all right well you you really didn't find that  interesting yesterday when it got completely personal it doesn't always have to be funny it was 
[03:12:00]  talking about the situation that was going on with him and his girlfriend not particularly not  particularly but you know i don't know anthony's girlfriend and i don't know anthony either you  know what i mean so if i had a better uh working knowledge of you guys and had more of a part you  know how it is when listeners listen to a show they become personal uh you become a part of our lives  and i didn't feel that way i can't i didn't feel it was uh that compelling i can't matter it's it's you  know the fans would yeah appreciate it more because they have a knowledge of me and you just  you just don't want to find it compelling hey it has nothing to do with me finding it compelling or 
[03:12:30]  wanting to because i'm just saying the feedback because you know we're we're smart radio guys we  know when we suck we know when we're having a good show we know when we're in the zone and the feedback  i gotta tell you from yesterday's show was unbelievable how much from dallas um it wasn't  necessarily dallas it was just the people around us and you know right it doesn't get broken down they  don't know like no i mean i can't i can't like start filtering email and go well dallas liked it  san francisco hated it boston liked it you know in general i'll say this in general people found a 
[03:13:00]  very interesting radio yesterday yeah and then we went and we went late and you know those guys had  a problem with that you know we talked to our uh wisp in philly they had no problem we went late  because they knew it was just one of those things and then today we went late just to bust their balls  yeah because the last thing they do is tell people to go listen to whoopi goldberg  but you know it was obvious we're gonna go late today just to bust their balls you know oh i know  i sat there and i'm like here they go and i i knew exactly what that was for right and but what i said 
[03:13:30]  is this is one of those deals where it's a pissing match between the midday guys and you guys but the  affiliates are the ones that take it on the chin nah i mean you guys would take it on the chin if all  sudden we we did this for the next two or three weeks it's it's over yeah we're done from where we  said we're done with them all right well then we can stop spray painting over the kiosks with your  pictures good god there's enough of them here i mean uh all right well i'm kind of surprised to be 
[03:14:00]  honest that you guys weren't enjoying that show yesterday but you know no no that's mondo listen  that's one guy talking to you don't well don't throw that out at everybody and this is dean i'm part  of the show barely but i i honestly i didn't hear yesterday because usually before the show i'm  crying and drunk and i don't hear a lot wait is that mondo talking no that's dean no no this is  not mondo i have nothing i'm not affiliated with him all right but i'm curious if you could look at  these pussies in here backing up no no no no i mean i have to say honestly i didn't get to hear it  yesterday so i was just wondering if you could just very briefly tell me what was going on because 
[03:14:30]  i know briefly anthony's girlfriend was sick or something like that but i guess what i'm asking is  why did it warrant um enough time that it knocked everything out of out of whack not that that's a  bad thing or good thing i'm just wondering what was it about that you know it was just because it was  unfolding as we were on the air so the thing is uh answers were being gotten and and and put out  over the air as things were happening so it ran late when the show started we didn't know when ant  was going to be able to get his girlfriend out it turned out it turned out to be a i'm embarrassed to 
[03:15:00]  say it a perfect radio bit because right when we're ending the show we get the good news that  she's going to be released from the hospital right and i know that sounds like oh my god they're doing  a hacky bit but it just worked out that way that worked out it was it was in real time so it's hard  to you know cut it off exactly when you're getting when you're getting some real radio from somebody on  the show and uh you can't all of a sudden say well hold that thought we'll be back after these  messages to hear more of anthony's pain so you know right we we went late and and uh we we got 
[03:15:30]  way behind in spots and guests and other things we want to do so when nine o'clock came around we had  this dude from uh employee of the month pedro pedro yeah now we're starting uh we're starting here  might have been pedro's uh twin brother his twin brother because they they send uh he said  yeah let me ask you guys this guy because uh again i'm kind of new to radio but should you date  someone based on the bitch you can get out of them just as a pointer yeah actually yes whatever 
[03:16:00]  material you can get it's 20 hours a week but you're too normal yeah now i'm just glad that you  guys and i hope you clarify it on the air monday because if uh jv and elvis weren't allowed to talk  about it uh because of chiosano or other management then that's fine it was because of you guys i'm like  that would be such a douche now mark churnoff told them to shut up uh and they shut up we would  never i we welcome them to talk about us as much as they want anybody talk talk talk whether we're  going to acknowledge it anymore or not you know we're done with them uh what happened yesterday 
[03:16:30]  it happened as you know uh we don't do that all the time we're off uh when we're supposed to be off  normal uh it happened you know once okay and uh they they you know blew a head gasket about it  uh so yeah today we did it just to screw with them and and you know what's really going on is  they don't like management and you know whatever yeah they got problems over there they got their  problems they want to go well beyond us they want to be doing a morning show or an afternoon drive  show so you know it's funny when i worked in new york i actually worked with cubby who's over there 
[03:17:00]  whoopi goldberg yeah yeah dear god that was uh that was a that was a great moment when she walked  into the studio and confronted us i'm not there there's another compelling moment that was fantastic  but she yeah she wrecked it yeah she did wreck it because we had like i don't know a month of  material oh we were going to pull tapes every day of her and just play them it was so bad  yeah but there was no gag order we're going to try to prove it on monday by dragging mark turnoff in  you know and what frustrates me we really try to do a very honest radio show we try we really do 
[03:17:30]  and you know there's so many guys in radio they just they spew you know lies and their listeners  just buy into it like well it's got to be true my favorite radio personality is telling me this  all right all right we try to prove it uh you know any way possible and we'll we'll drag mark or or  tom chiusano in monday to say it i'll call joel hollander personally and make sure you know that  that uh that's cleared up yeah all right very cool all right well i'm glad you guys called us 
[03:18:00]  actually because we didn't know how to get a hold of you the only thing we could do is call the free  fm station in new york right all right yeah do you have a personal number we can get yeah we know  better than that why you needed who needs a job who needs a job who needs a job all right thank you  thank you all right i'll take it easy all right see you there they go he'll talk shit about us right  now who are they that was i guarantee it i guarantee it that was one of those like meetings that that 
[03:18:30]  people have where it's very uncomfortable like political meetings where it's two countries that  are like i don't know about you all right we're not going to war here today but my gut feeling is  my gut feeling is everyone in that studio knows that yesterday was one of those days in radio yeah  radio gold it was compelling it was playing out in real time what the fuck are we supposed to do  what was his name mondo i don't know but i think mondo's whole gig is that he's got to be the one  that i didn't i didn't think much of is that his life i'm not well he had a point though i mean like 
[03:19:00]  when you know you and you listen to you guys every day it's like dude i really know you i know you  but your girl listeners will be more involved right but that's something anyone punching around the  dial can punch into and go you know if you're into talk radio you're gonna stop and go what the  fuck is going on here yeah and check it out a hospital holding you hostage isn't a good enough story  exactly i could tell you when we suck i mean i don't know i think it's kind of dishonest if uh  another radio guy's gonna say that yesterday wasn't interesting it's hard for me to really  believe that he believes that but that's my opinion but i respect uh that he had the balls 
[03:19:30]  to say something hey but i don't understand i think you guys were going in into this call  to bash i thought these guys were talking about you it seemed like you guys were going into a fight  and that's how we work it's it's an honest show we're not going let's call up and get in a fight  a radio fight no no no it's like let's get the truth no you let them talk you talk first and then  when you start getting shit like we did yesterday with those two jerk offs then it goes into battle  mode but there's no reason just because it's another show on on your phone that you got to all 
[03:20:00]  the sudden act like fucking animals so all the time so these guys are basically what i'm trying to  say is uh i ever worked alice can i do this show i you know i should have seen that coming a mile  away yes ridge who's you don't know who pugs and pugs and kelly are on that station it's us jagger  oh yeah pugs and kelly i've never done dallas and then a guy that i've done what's his name again he  really hates us oh he had some shit with you another fucking bunch of bullshit happened there 
[03:20:30]  said that you were sending him emails right saying you're next we're taking over your next we're taking  over your gig it was a complete lie and we actually had a computer geek uh prove that it was a lie to  this pd and he was still buying into the horse shit this guy was saying uh russ myers or russ  myers something like that yeah like i was uh writing emails to a to a a station in dallas saying  we're coming for your gig like what this is we were trying to take on the whole radio world at that  time we're just trying to survive in new york and uh all the stations were syndicated to do you know 
[03:21:00]  it's so funny like how like someone like these arrogant these midday guys will go after you like  jv knows but but someone like hannity who is as well respected yeah what he does is you guys do  you know what it is because hey you know what these guys are on my level i can hang talent isn't afraid  of talent yeah hey uh i don't know what's wrong with tom freddie it was a fucking opinion let him  have it we didn't let him have his yeah norton wouldn't let him have well he would have let him  yeah i know no i mean i respect i don't know let me let me uh say hi to darren and dallas darren 
[03:21:30]  this proves i just know the radio business go ahead darren you were absolutely right opie he just  got on the radio after y'all got off and said that yeah i'm the one that's got the balls in the room  and the rest of them were like yeah i got too much to lose to go to go to bat with these two guys  and you you caught it just right the guy that he had the balls for saying he he didn't think  yesterday was compelling i saw right through it i'm like come on yep that was his thing and even 
[03:22:00]  if he didn't or doesn't that's fine too like who who gives a shit it's just they're douche bags  anyway i hate them anyway i listened to them before i got my eczema and got turned on to y'all and he's  a he's a piece of shit i hate him everything's um all right darren i honestly don't know much about  i just want to know why i'm an arrogant cunt oh you want to go there yeah why you're a cunt it says tom  oklahoma ant is an arrogant cunt hello tom hey how you doing all right russ myers is mondo topless 
[03:22:30]  it's russ martin sorry martin uh yeah why okay uh why am i an arrogant cunt because because you say  it isn't that compelling radio like everybody's supposed to be impressed i didn't say hold on  hold on sir i never said once in i i never said that was compelling radio tom it was me never opie  said it was compelling radio and let me explain okay of course not everyone's gonna find a compelling 
[03:23:00]  radio but i'm talking about the you know in general in general that was a compelling radio show people  were glued to the radio got a lot of email from people saying i was late for work i i couldn't leave  my car i guess i'm speaking in general terms of course there's people out there like boring and  they moved on to something else let me address tom here for a second also uh opie's was not in the  situation i was i can't say whether it was compelling or not tom are you there yeah tom yeah uh i i can't 
[03:23:30]  offer an opinion on how compelling it was because i was involved in it it was my situation  and so you understand it's like i i would i i i could never say that was some compelling radio  that was just uh what was happening and me conveying it and not only that when an athlete plays a good  game he knows it's a good game he goes you know what i played above my level today or i did well you  don't go he's an arrogant douchebag he knows he did better even like uh the rolling stones mick jack  yeah he knows he's in the zone and and giving the people a great concert but there's still 
[03:24:00]  definitely be someone in the audience going ah they suck tonight but i'm talking in general terms  you know yeah i just know that that was a great show yesterday i just know in hey in my soul yes  tom hey why don't you let your fans or lack thereof speak for your successes see here now you now you  called with an agenda you called with an agenda you did you don't like it well wait a minute let's  talk civilly you don't like us and you said our fans are lack thereof with no knowledge of 
[03:24:30]  our ratings tom right do you know how many listeners i have our ratings tom i have our  ratings i know how many listeners we have and saying our lack thereof is some ignorant uh response  you're making because you don't know how many listeners we do it's been printed that we do have  listeners so what you're saying is is a bullshit you called with an agenda i didn't call with an  agenda oh let me explain what agenda means i'm sorry i'm sorry get a freaking addiction 
[03:25:00]  oh you don't explain anything to me i'm not a crazy cunt like your girlfriend oh  hey don't don't call her crazy  which is the heaviest box to lift yeah  uh yeah yeah  don't act like anything else anything else tom  oh i gotta go back to listening to howard stern like everybody else oh you got you got serious 
[03:25:30]  there you go wait you got them both you got serious nxm tom wow you tom tom tom  storm what's that tom has more radios than he does teeth  you're not my my wife or my sister tom yeah what are you you know what some articles on howard  stern then you'll realize how wrong you were and last day and keep listening you listen every day  hey tom keep listening you know everything that's going on thank you know everything that happens on  the show thanks tom thanks for the call tom receding hairline asshole and that's a prime example of what 
[03:26:00]  happens on this show that doesn't happen on other shows that he gets through i want them i want to hear  what he has to say and address it and there it was the guy an uninformed jerk off yeah yeah you guys  i mean look and he said something funny and we kind of laughed yeah i mean he most guys are so  egotistical they do nothing wrong and the reason why it was compelling is because usually talk radio  is about news and blah blah blah and and celebrities very rarely do you get a guy who's the star of the 
[03:26:30]  show let everybody in because you're actually you get letting assholes like him in to say that  shit about your kick but you're saying fuck it god this is really going down that's what's  happening that's why it's compelling can i tell you why yesterday's show was so compelling why opie  because i know radio like like this he's he's pointing to the back of your hand  on your forearm with the bump that boss put on the back of your hand with a golf ball  your malignant tumor  it looks like a rocky road the reason yesterday's show was so compelling is 
[03:27:00]  because everyone is talking about it today ah look at that jaggers saying that well his show he's got  it he's the representative of the show i guess it's his show so their show in general saying it wasn't  compelling really then why are you talking to us today there's no other reason to talk to us today  right now we create a talk that's what you do with a talk show right what do you do even that 
[03:27:30]  guy that you know what that speech on compelling was compelling that's what i'm saying i like the  hell to find something compelling that was that was compelling what you just said it made me  i feel compelled to comment on what you just said about compelling i would be compelled by what you just  said but i'm still so compelled about that compelling stove refrigerator yes it was compelling if i could  say fridge and if you don't hold on let's say hi to jason in oklahoma jason hey boys how you  doing good hi jason um i would like to apologize on behalf of the state of oklahoma for that last 
[03:28:00]  caller are you apologizing for for tom yeah we're uh we're banning oklahoma from the show today oh we  have we're putting a gag order on oklahoma that we have to do it uh you still have fans here all  right thanks jason thank you jason all right uh hey so this uh i've never met anybody from oklahoma  this man attempted to light x on fire oh now there's a guy opie doesn't even bad now i think that's 
[03:28:30]  acceptable psycho boss had a line today oh jesus laura yes laura hello hi hi i just wanted to nominate  rich boss for line of the day which one thank you which one slow down i'm sorry you were talking  to that author and you asked her what size she was and she said she was a size eight and he said to what 
[03:29:00]  power oh okay to what power yeah good a little math joke that's not bad but thank you nobody even  laughed so i thought i was nominated there's a lot of theories they don't laugh uh brett in boston  hey oh what's going on bud hey so you are a genius marketing guy but that was clearly not  compelling radio yesterday i hate to say it you know we're listening to aunt talk like a lunatic  to these hospital people and it just probably wasn't working out even for us regular listeners 
[03:29:30]  come on guys one one one man's opinion it's all subjective but what i don't understand is don't you  when you're talking to like uh uh corporations and don't you get so frustrated that they put you on  hold and put you through this and that don't i mean don't you deal with that all the time right  sir i can't well you know i can't we're gonna end this because this is so it was it was an amazing  show yesterday the daily news wrote about it first of all i didn't put it on the radio i didn't put it  on the radio for it to be a great compelling segment it was happening i couldn't in all honesty come in 
[03:30:00]  yesterday and do a show about uh goofy stories in the news brett it's not a thing i couldn't just  come and sit down i didn't want to take another day off and just sit at home uh stewing about this  so i figured i'd come in and put it out over the air whether it made great radio or not wasn't  my motivation or anything here's the deal okay here's the deal the people that hated the radio  yesterday would probably also hate to see jimmy norton at the pittsburgh improv tonight tomorrow three shows 
[03:30:30]  it's a it's a it's a plug  yeah i saw jimmy last night i also saw him in secret agent man and you know jimmy was hysterical  as usual you'd expect that yeah but the real star of the show afterwards was the secret agent man  he's kind of like a mix between a carny and one of those baseball stadium vendor guys dude i gotta  ask you something about uh how they're feeling in boston yeah go fuck yourself 
[03:31:00]  fish bag i do that much better than than you know i got him to say yeah that's all i wanted  oh okay yeah the timing was off i just wanted to say yeah  made me uncomfortable i just wanted him to say yeah bad for him you don't give him the  fucking boston fucking sympathy shit mr i wasn't don't get mad at me  i felt uncomfortable about that i was shaking my seltzer bottle out of him  like an old jew the only time you scare me is when you have your fucking wine glass  look at you young man 
[03:31:30]  don't you give him your sympathy i got him to say yeah that's all i was trying to get him to say  and then hung up on him it was just all right look look you and your shaking  i'll crash myself put it this way after the break opie does an impression oh oh  opie and anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big god damn they are heavily into one thing  boobies boobies yes one of you i don't know which one said then you can pull out your business  it's junk we're artists you presented as innocent but i'm not so sure it is screw you we're artists 
[03:32:00]  is there anything you won't do for ratings we are publicity whore bags publicity sluts we're  artists this is all about money that's what it comes down to but you're mercenaries i mean  aren't you mercenaries we're radio mercenaries dickhead we're artists we're entertainers we're not  psychologists we're not doctors we're not daycare workers we're artists so it's all on appearance  none on you none on us we're artists none on us 
[03:32:30]  we can't destroy  all right there bobby why do you want to do this  bobby untangle himself from his mic cord in the mic stand i don't do this every day man attempts to  light x on fire is gonna have to wait we got a big huge uh movie star yes waiting to come in 
[03:33:00]  absolutely why is he still sitting out there i know why are you still sitting out there  you're like what gunny gunny bring in gunny here he is  here's gunny how's everybody doing this morning great fantastic now i'm i'm proud of you guys  satellite radio is is the the rage of the age i have it in both of my cars and uh what are you on 
[03:33:30]  what kind of cars wouldn't trade it for anything what kind of cars you got the willies you know  i've i'm rich and i've never bought a new car in my life i'm just too conservative i have an 80 86 mercedes  sec that i'm customizing and it's uh i have another 450 sl mercedes uh that's a 77 yeah but i like the  old cars the older ones the new ones are all plastic you know that what do you listen on uh to on xm  everything everything everything you check out dylan's show yet uh don't know you have to 
[03:34:00]  understand that my time in the car is pretty limited you know and it's from l.a uh from i  live in palmdale west of palmdale not in the desert and why would he listen to that goddamn hippie  so what i what i generally tune into is uh drive time talk uh political shows because i need to  stay abreast of what's going on politically yeah i love uh watching mail call it's one of my favorites 
[03:34:30]  it's one of my favorites too letters but you get to do some stuff that i mean dream come true it's the  coolest job in the world i i was telling the guys out there in the in the green room just a while ago  that monday i spent the entire day down in tennessee uh flying a p-51 mustang and dog fighting and  doing barrel rolls and it was a 1945 vintage p-51 what a what a fantastic day a mail call episode  nothing came up oh absolutely not i don't do that you don't throw up you throw up it's all mind over 
[03:35:00]  matter i don't blow chunks you know uh it's it would be an embarrassing situation if i've done the f-15  i've done you know so many different airplanes and every helicopter in the military's arsenal  and if i blew chunks i that would be embarrassing invite me back no we got to introduce you to bob  kelly because this guy all you have to all you have to say is whatever and he'll puke yeah he's  got a weak stomach i did i did the mustang in california for a thousand bucks uh marine pilots will 
[03:35:30]  take you up six thousand feet and give you the stick and and tourgasm there you go yeah oh that was  the plane you flew in tour yeah you basically you know you dig it they go go ahead i mean they're  still there of course they're there you know you're just in your case i wish they would have  jumped out with a shoot actually it's easy to fly it's very easy to fly but literally six thousand  feet he goes you do this to the stick the plane goes like that and i as you don't puke when you  come back level and you see the horizon and you're still doing this yeah doing four g's i i i threw up 
[03:36:00]  twice they filled up both bags they changed my call sign to snacks to two bags now you know why  they charge a thousand dollars it probably cost half that to get somebody to clean the mess up  clean the chunks out of them my wife is uh is prone to sea sickness car sickness uh she you can't even  drive across a bridge without her getting sick no i got sick in a chinook when i went to iraq to do 
[03:36:30]  some comedy and they take you up in the chinook helicopters i think they're called with the  the 50 cals in the window the open old school i'm sure gunny spent uh enough time in some chinooks  chinooks uh uh beef uh uh the 46 is my favorite the och 46 it's uh being replaced right now with  with the osprey hey you see what's going on here by the way bob kelly's trying to make his puking sound  cool yeah he's trying to toughen up his throwing up in front of gunny i wasn't six thousand feet  you you saw a woman that you drove up like a man let me explain though this week alone we had a fat 
[03:37:00]  girl come in with a hernia sticking out of her belly button he puked yeah he threw up and he looked  at it yeah i don't know i might kind of have a little problem with that myself it was a hernia  you could see the food pulsating oh beautiful i actually saw her her twin her twin winked at me  through the hernia like watching a horror show speaking of horror yeah oh no he's a professional  yep we have texas chainsaw massacre the beginning coming out this friday or excuse me uh next friday 
[03:37:30]  uh the on the sixth and and uh as you know the first one remake that was great the remake was great  i was a little skeptical uh about doing the remake because the first one was such a kick butt you know  you know and i was a little nervous about that and i read the script and and we actually were  able to make a better movie than the the original movie so it turned out great then he came up with  the proposition that we should do a prequel and i was extremely skeptical skeptical about that simply 
[03:38:00]  because almost every prequel that you see or sequel that you see is riding on the coattails of the  original which was a fantastic show and and then the studios throw together a bunch of crap  and expect to shove it down your throat and you can't stand to sit through more than about 15  or 20 minutes before you leave the theater yeah i'm proud to say that uh i was giving a creative  license and we were able to uh just make it better and better and better the script was good to begin 
[03:38:30]  with but before we did each scene every morning when i would come in i would sit down with the director  and the producers and and uh who whichever other actors might be in the scene we would throw we would  put on the table everything that we had and we would throw ideas back and forth until we thought we  had the best the scene as tight and as good as we could possibly make it then we shot it you know  just i think and they tell me that the uh the show is better uh and i i've watched it i've seen 
[03:39:00]  it three times and i'm here to tell you that the actually the remake or excuse me the uh uh  texas chainsaw massacre the beginning is better than the the remake was i heard that too now here  yeah that's the buzz on the i i read a bunch of stuff on the internet about it like this week  actually it's really gruesome they said it's better than the first one they just did yeah  it's hard to clean up but you know you've got somebody with a chainsaw it's a little rough  cleaning that mess the idea of a prequel is pretty good too to see where you guys 
[03:39:30]  came from and how you got so screwed up what we do is you know in the in the remake we had uncle  monty in his little wooden uh wheelchair cruising around with no legs how did that happen yeah  monty's legs and uh the sheriff sheriff hoyt my character uh has no teeth in front his teeth have  been knocked out how'd that happen uh matter of fact if you want to go there how in the hell did  he ever become a sheriff this guy's a bit sick you know he's a little off the off the off the not 
[03:40:00]  here a little bit but he's crazy as hell and how'd he become a sheriff and where did leather face come  from did uh did a crow crap him out on a rock and the sun hatch him or what you know i'll tell you  where he came from he came from a female's body and uh he was born and uh and then uh sheriff hoyt  took him under his wing and gave him good guidance and leadership and he turned out to be such a fine  he didn't take him under a porch when it started raining out uh actually uh actually uh he was a 
[03:40:30]  very protected guarded individual now how he was special i i just got to ask you about uh a little bit  of your history and stuff how did you get into acting what what what went from the military uh  to acting how did how did you have a marine corps i was a grant i was an instructor most of my uh  most of my tenure in marine corps and uh uh got hurt in vietnam got retired out i kept showing up  for work but they did retire me and i've been with the marine corps for 45 years i'll be with the 
[03:41:00]  marine corps till i die i've been to the far east uh or the middle east uh three times two weeks at a  time uh the marine corps gives me a couple of helicopters and ch-46 as a rule and off into the  combat zone i go i wear the uniform the the black jacket kevlar helmet i've seen on mail call and and  other shows where you're in the middle east you're you're with the troops and the are you are you  surprised and flattered of the the respect that you get from these soldiers because you know i've earned 
[03:41:30]  that respect i i'm part of the marine corps uh i take great pride in in serving uh i'll never let  them down i'll always be there for them nothing quite like jumping up on the hood of a humby out  in the middle of the combat zone and getting the troops to laugh at your corny jokes you know the  way they treat you though is like you got stars on your shoulders that's how i don't know it because  everybody knows me i spend about 200 days a year with the military you know and and so these guys all 
[03:42:00]  know me and they respect me because i treat them as they should be treated with respect and uh how  did i get started i found myself uh retired standing outside the gate of the marine corps recruit depot  in san diego with my sea bag at my side and that's all i owned in this world thinking what the hell am  i going to do now because i have no education to speak of and then i thought you know hollyweird is  just up the road 40 miles i can go to hollyweird i wrote a script and i was a good instructor 
[03:42:30]  and in order to keep uh tired recruits a thousand recruits awake and and laughing at your corny jokes  you know you've got to be pretty on your toes so anyway i was a good instructor i figured what the  heck i wrote a script i went to hollywood and i did the comedy clubs for a year i was up there doing  comedy comedy and uh god helped the individual that heckled this down in his face talk about drive  something up the wrong side of your body yeah but uh that worked out good and then one of my buddies 
[03:43:00]  and i was sleeping on people's couches and ymca was good but um and i didn't have a car couldn't afford  a car but uh a friend of mine told me hey gunny they're getting ready to do vietnam war shows over  in the philippines so i i was single i packed my gear and packed up my little sea bag and jumped on  space available at george air force base and went back to the philippines met the right people and  got involved and that's rest of its history and that uh movie was full metal jacket of course it was 
[03:43:30]  you're talking full metal jacket that was film number five by the way was it that was film number  five and and in a previous film i had taken uh i was technical advisor boys and company c yeah i think  it was before yeah that was you see purple heart siege of firebase glory it goes on but uh i was able  to take a role away from an actor and they sent his young put him on the airplane set his young tail  back to hollywood and i did his i did his shtick must have been very so i knew yeah i knew you could 
[03:44:00]  take roles away from actors now as i since you weren't an actor uh walking into that but you had done  stand up wasn't that just a one shot of you going around the troops at the beginning giving your  speech i don't remember seeing a cut and you had a lot of dialogue there want to hear it i yeah don't  doubt i'll give you the clean version no you can satellite oh you're okay with the bat but then you  can say whatever you want okay this is not family family related uh it gets nasty okay here you go 
[03:44:30]  i am gunnery sergeant ermy i am your senior drill instructor from now on you will speak only when  spoken to the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be sir do you maggots understand  that yes yes bullshit i can't hear you sound off like you've got a pair yes if you ladies leave my  island if you survive recruit training you will be a weapon you will be a minister of death praying  for war but until that day you're pukes you're scumbags you're the lowest form of life on earth you're 
[03:45:00]  not even human fucking beings you are nothing but a lot of little unorganized grabastic pieces of  civilian shit my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serving my beloved  core there is no racial bigotry here here we do not look down on niggers kayaks wops or greasers here  you are all equally worthless is that understood yes sir there you go wow that's your stairway to heaven 
[03:45:30]  that's the first time i've done that in about a year i was gonna to see you do that though live  is like yeah zeppelin let zeppelin do stairway yeah my favorite line in in the entire movie was  something that i came up with i lost my way and i'm not the type of guy that will just stop i'll  continue until i get back on track and then finish the scene but my favorite line which came out of  nowhere and it was it looked like the kind of person that would buck a person in the ass and not even 
[03:46:00]  have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around i'll be watching you  and stanley kirk jumped off the camera truck and said lee what's what's a reach around use your  imagination stanley poor stanley but that was that was a tremendous show i enjoyed doing i loved doing  that show and i wrote most everything that i did in the show yeah and uh texas chainsaw massacre uh 
[03:46:30]  i was allowed to do a lot of ab living so uh the first uh the sheriff the first time i did the sheriff in  the first texas chainsaw massacre there really wasn't anything written for the sheriff so i had to  basically come up with almost everything that we did and it got to the point where we would do the  scene the way that it was written then the director would say okay lee do you do one yeah they would  let me do mine and it was always mine that showed up in the show that's what people want to say you 
[03:47:00]  know it worked out great and and i got to tell you guys if uh if uh the beginning texas chainsaw massacre the  beginning wasn't better than the the last one i would not be sitting here okay i recommend it it's  it's a great show great man bring your barf bag it's a bit hard yeah there you go  yeah we had a 15 we had over a 15 million dollar budget and they tell me half of that was spent on  stage blood nice and gruesome i know it's gruesome but is it is it scary i mean is it like i mean 
[03:47:30]  leather face was like oh man this guy's coming there's a couple things we would that really  bother us uh psychologically one is we would never want to be eaten by an animal such as a white shark  or a uh tiger right you know you'd be attacked and and eaten by an animal that's that sucks  pretty horrific that really sucks yeah and and the other thing is being cut by a damn chainsaw yeah  just the sound of that but that thing cranks up yeah you know it's not a clean wound no no it's 
[03:48:00]  it's it's a ripping thing you know the shot the the chainsaw had been cutting wood it's not sharp  no no okay well i i'm looking forward to seeing it because uh the first one i guess that was great  you know what else is scary though a cop a man with a badge who's psychotic that's what scares me  a cop because you you know as soon as you see him you trust them that's a cop you're gonna save me  but then to find out he's a fucking lunatic and he could do what he wants and he's bringing 
[03:48:30]  into his creepy son yeah now it's like oh i'm fucked yeah my my guide the sheriff is uh i i think  sheriff hoyt is uh is the second most uh favorite part that i i've ever done really i really enjoy  him you know so many i take every role that i do and i've done 75 feature films and and every every  role that i've ever done ever ever character i always take it push it to the limit i try to get  it right up where it he doesn't go over the edge but he's right up to the limit nothing aggravates me 
[03:49:00]  more than a director saying take it down bring it down a couple of notches and uh less is less is  more yeah which we know is a crocus shit less is not more i don't know how who came up with that but  they're full of crap with a small dick yeah i guess that somebody is sexually insecure there you  go the guy you're stealing the scene from but this guy with the big one knows where to go you know and  the beautiful thing about uh sheriff hoyt is god he's a sexually perverted homicidal maniac there is no 
[03:49:30]  over the damn top with this guy and they just let me go berserk and i have a great time doing him he's  fine he's fine can we ask about your ring yeah i'm looking at that diamond i can't  take my honest that would be the mother of all marine corps oh yeah i went to the p my old ring  i wore on my right hand that's my change pocket and i wore the emblem off of it over the years  and about 10 years ago my wife asked me what i'd like for father's day and i said well i pretty much  need a new ring we looked all over the px's and couldn't find they were the common usual not so cool 
[03:50:00]  rings and so i sat down and i made a couple of sketches and give her a pat on the butt  and sent her off to the jewelry store and she had this guy make this thing it turned out  a little bit larger than what i had in mind  you know it though it's the super bowl ring of the marine yeah  for you you're bigger than life so you ought to have a big ring but if you're secure in your  masculinity a man can wear jewelry you know that's yeah how many carats i don't want to 
[03:50:30]  say you have a diamond that's uh four carats oh wow but it it didn't just uh it wasn't  the jewel loop out of your eye rich it wasn't born being four carats it was actually when it  originally was made it was a half carat and then every year every father's day thereafter my wife  would take it and take it down to the jewelry store and kick it up a notch you know and i do the  same for her so it was an investment basically over 10 years it's evolved into a four carat diamond 
[03:51:00]  from a half a carat do you have kids do you have kids uh well you you could call them kids uh  they're they're old kids they're they're all over 20 imagine him being your dad though having to wake  up you late for school in the morning i don't want to go get you just fucked up boy  great santini done it so much better than i did though you know i i was kind of a failure when it 
[03:51:30]  come to being a father simply because i was just gone all the time and so i would come home i would  be home for a few days just long enough to get him squared away get the baggy pants off the boy  and get the skateboard away from him and and the next thing you know i'd be on the airplane going  away i'd come home and the wife would have taken him shopping by then and he had all brand new baggy  pants you know she was a pushover and and i was the disciplinarian but problem was the disciplinarian  was always gone yeah so what are you gonna do did you make him cut his hair did he have to have a 
[03:52:00]  short haircut uh they they were pretty neat up until uh the probably when they were 16 17 years old and  the hair is growing my son has a lot of hair right now and uh i i i point that out to him occasionally  yeah he has too much hair doesn't seem like you're very happy about it yeah but so be it you know  it doesn't do anything he's obviously obviously he doesn't have enough respect for me to go cut his hair 
[03:52:30]  so one of these days i have to come home with a couple of big guys take him down and just cut the  dog show but you're his ass you know teach him a lesson yeah i hear you i'm sure that will work  it's great wow you'll love me forever yeah don't hold back man because you're right you can speak  freely did you hate i mean after you were done doing stand-up were you glad i mean compared to  acting i mean did you did you just hate the world around stand more money a lot more money that's that's 
[03:53:00]  the only difference i i love doing stand-up it's fun and it's instant uh recognition gratification  yeah rich and and it's better uh a chuckle hut or full metal jacket no no no no the thing is the  movies go on and on and on you know and like full metal jacket you know we did that 20 years ago i  know it's amazing and it still goes strong today there's not a day goes by what i don't sign a  a number of copies of full metal yeah i did it i did a thing for the troops called full metal comedy 
[03:53:30]  right i went over there oh you just compared are you insane compare yourself to a legend you  you fucking blimp how dare you go puke in the back of you jackass put your fucking put your  midget hand down don't point at me with that finger you use your elbow if you're going to point  there i have a concept to throw up to you here yeah uh see what your opinion is now we've done two  texas chainsaw massacres probably are uh chances are we will do a a sequel to the prequel uh and i was 
[03:54:00]  thinking you know last right in the middle of the last show i was i was starting to dribble and droodle  and write and think about ideas i think a huge tremendously successful show would be a spoof  on texas chainsaw massacre and i was thinking about i would name it it would be a musical comedy  musical and it would be i would call it uh new york hacksaw manicure you know don't you could you  just imagine all right all right who's gonna do it i'll do it you get a man with a chair of point 
[03:54:30]  and and uh and uh they're dancing around like a couple of fairies to you know  what happened man you're just start off the why don't you yell at him boss you angry little jew  he just said hey something about a manicure so he maybe he made the right decision decision with  acting but here's the thing he could take that ring and put a dent in my head and he should and  he should the other day a fly there was i was watching news in the hotel room and there was a 
[03:55:00]  damn fly and it landed on my head and not even thinking i i hit that fly and it nearly knocked me  out i saw a starch for about a minute  but this ring is a lethal weapon i have to be very careful with it you know god damn well  my point was with that that thing is that back then you you say now comics actors the comics make  more money now because if you go actors are actually turning into comics because you can go 
[03:55:30]  on you makes more money you know how much money he'd make comics doing stand-up if he he could fill  if he could fill a club i mean he'd make uh 30 000 a night but it's only the few you know it's only  the few it's the eddie murphys and the whoopie uh goldbergs and it's like you know only a few of  the comics really do make the big bucks no all the rest of them are stuck on saturday night live  making 150 a week no no that's back in the old days there was no money i got paid a hundred bucks 
[03:56:00]  of stand-up when i was doing stand-up and what do you make rich where was that well that's good  hundred bucks to stand up are you talking who are you talking to i'm rich boss you know rich  do you know rich ross from last comic standing from last comic standing or tough crowd with colin  when yes i watch yeah do you know him from it if you seriously if you recognize just walking  the street me or him who do you think you would recognize more me or the or i i wouldn't recognize  either one of you good answer thank god and i'm so glad norton isn't here i'm so glad jimmy 
[03:56:30]  norton isn't here because it would upset me if you did recognize jimmy and jimmy is a big fan the  tough part is you know there's a lot of uh of actors that are doing uh singing now you know they're  going to singing of course if you have a hit record you make money but you can sing all damn  day and not have a hit record and you're not going to make beans you know it's like writing that book  you first of all have to make back the 35 000 advance they gave you before you make a penny  well i wrote a book about three years ago and i haven't i've the advance is all i saw that was it 
[03:57:00]  that was it you know and it's a good book and they sold a bunch of copies but you just it's gotta be  harry potter you know in order to make money what was it about called mail call the book and it was  i took a bunch of the old scripts and i i hate to waste my time and i'm sitting on the airplane five  hours going from la to new york and from new york to la and seattle and and washington dc and i'm  wasting my time and so i got all the old scripts from mail call and and uh i went back and all the 
[03:57:30]  research was done already so i went back and i i just did uh i did a book yeah i wrote a book and  uh changed everything of course as far as dialogue and the way it works but um pictures put some  pictures in there and and i wrote a book and and they've sold thousands of copies i know i've done  book signings and i've sold at least 10 000 copies of the book you didn't see uh no i haven't seen the  dime i haven't seen a dime you gotta sell a million you know the biography and the problem 
[03:58:00]  the biggest problem is uh with these actors that are going into like stand-up for instance okay it  should be the other way around because from stand-up you go into acting and there's where the big bucks  is uh you know unless you are the the main guy on the ticket you don't make any money you know you  get the audience warmed up you know as well as i do you've been there did that yeah i've been  yeah you know you go and warm up the audience for for eddie murphy and what do you get you get 250 
[03:58:30]  bucks 300 bucks and the fat chick yeah and the fat chick that's it but it's a fat drunk chick  you should definitely write a book about a biography biography you're in vietnam you said right well i'm  gonna write a biography but i'm not done yet god yeah i know right i'm not so young i want to wait  until i get old don't you want to have the money no then i want to sit around and write a book you  know yeah can i ask you a question i want to wait actually i won't wait until my dad dies because  i have a lot of really filthy nasty things to say about him and i don't want to have to do it while 
[03:59:00]  he's still alive he's worried about his dad not his wife or his kids you can tell one story for us  you gotta have something no you know my dad had me totally convinced when i was a kid  uh that my i thought my name was stupid you know and until i went in the marine corps and they pointed  out the fact that my my first name was ronald my middle name was lee and last name was army i thought 
[03:59:30]  it was just stupid oh no really yeah he had all of us totally i mean you know you don't call yourself  hey idiot come here well that's my father okay in his drunken stupor uh so it was like uh that's what i  put up with and that's what i was convinced by the time i got in the marine corps that i was a total  loser a total idiot and it uh thank god for my three drill instructors they pulled me out of that  ditch cleaned me off and and hosed me down and and put me in the right direction and convinced me that 
[04:00:00]  there wasn't much in this world that i couldn't accomplish if i set my mind to it is that what drove  you into the corps like oh i was in the marine corps the the day i was 17 i was on the bus man i was  wow the hell out of dodge yeah i grew up on a farm in kansas a little farm and my dad was uh my dad was  an alcoholic tyrant and uh he had six boys that might have a little something to do with why he  was an alcoholic tyrant you know six boys oh can you imagine one year apart they i guess mom and he 
[04:00:30]  didn't figure out what caused that you know until it was way too late six kids later they figured out how  that happens so uh and and and on the farm back in the early 50s we didn't have electricity so well  hell when it got dark you went to bed well what do you do when you go to bed you make babies right  so he's got to have some entertainment tv back in those days it's just screwing is all you had to do 
[04:01:00]  just go screw your brains out come on baby let's go to bed oh make another baby yeah my first wife was  oh jesus again didn't we just do this last week excuse me but are you abnormally oversexed geez baby  so you talk to your father now uh my dad's okay he and i can't be in the same room for  much more than 10 or 15 minutes uh he and i believe uh we're differently politically we're different 
[04:01:30]  uh he he is one of these democrats that uh is totally 100 a democrat and i don't have a problem  with that but what i do have a problem with is is why are you a democrat uh i asked him you can ask  him who is the president of the united states he can't tell you he don't know who the vice president  is uh he voted for uh the democrat on the ticket he can't tell you who that guy was that guy's name was  and he can't tell you what he believed in or what he stood for uh all he knows is that back in the 
[04:02:00]  50s the democrats were union men and he's a union man and the reason he he got decent pay when he  worked for the railroad was because they they went on strike and the democrats backed him up the unions  and and uh for as far as he's concerned he goes into the uh the booth the voting booth he and his wife  and his wife is instructed and she's a yes lady and they go in and they punch everything with a d beside 
[04:02:30]  it they will not listen to uh if they see something a political person on tv that might  be talking about i'm running for president and and i would like to have your vote and this is what  i stand for blink he changes the channel he didn't want anything to do with it how old a gentleman is  he now he's 82 and he's not a gentleman don't make that mistake okay i was being respectful  i'm an ass no sense in being respectful he's he's okay but he and i get along fine now because i can  kick his ass but uh it was a hard it was a hard time growing up and i was number two i had an older 
[04:03:00]  brother and then i was number two and number two is always the guy that sucks iron tit you know eats  the shit and i was the guy that it was always my fault you know did you ever have that moment with  your father where you finally crossed over like you've been in the core for a while and you came  did you visit and then show him like listen motherfucker no i had to beat him at arm wrestling  was that it yeah that was the only way i got the upper hand some big dramatic scene of you taking 
[04:03:30]  your hat off and come on hit me yeah when i pinned him and then i looked him straight in the eyes and  said and and and now you have some kind of an idea about what i might be able to do to you if you  fuck with me anymore you cocksucker oh wow uncomfortable but he came around dad dad's not  a bad guy i get along okay with dad now but we uh we have an understanding you know i have my  beliefs he has his beliefs i grew up in a democratic family but i i'm uh an independent yeah i don't 
[04:04:00]  really agree with uh everything that the republicans do and i certainly don't agree with what what the  democrats do uh but you know i'm one of those guys that i've remained independent so that i can look  at the the individual and i i make up my mind you know by by listening to what his ideas are and i want  i want to vote for the guy that's going to do the best thing he can for this country what's pissed me  off here lately is the democrats and the republicans that seems to me like they've evolved into a situation 
[04:04:30]  where they they vote for what's good for the party not what's good for you and i or america  and that bugs me well i just heard about the uh senatorial vote on um it was the uh the bill for  the prisoners oh now isn't that sweet now what are we supposed to do you know they've got color tv  and air conditioning and i mean come on playboy magazines what more do they need and we need yeah  we need to tie up these loose ends yeah what do we can't keep them in gitmo for the rest of you 
[04:05:00]  know for the next hundred years there was a democrat don't remember the state or the name  because i heard it on the way in uh who actually voted for this bill uh so during the next election  his competitor the republican can't run um ads against him saying he you know voted down the uh  anti-terrorism bill he actually voted against what he wanted to do just so the his opponent  guy wouldn't have ammo to shoot at him what the kind of guy you vote for what you feel is supposed 
[04:05:30]  to be right you think that's what they're doing do you mean you vote with your heart would you be  saying something i would think you would think what yeah some stupid thing like that it's like  perhaps what you feel is best for the people that you're representing when it cracks me up so ted  kennedy the biggest job like a pope i spent four weeks in iraq i wore the uniform i the flak jacket the  kevlar helmet i was out in the field with the troops in the combat zone we got stuck in fire 
[04:06:00]  fights we had uh uh shoulder uh one of these motherfuckers rpg shot at us interrupt you for  a second though but could you imagine one of these al-qaeda motherfuckers who just like watched one of  his movies gone holy shit that's the fucking guy i got i just got shot by arlie ermey but anyway i was  over there for four four weeks and i come back and i mean i've seen nothing but el primo uh morale  was that uh just going through the roof and you have to understand these kids are realist re-enlisting 
[04:06:30]  at the rate of 70 percent right now 70 percent 70 out of 100 of these kids that joined re-enlist in the  marine corps so they re-enlist knowing damn well that they're going to go back to the sandbox and fight  this war some more now it tells me that tells me that they must have tremendous faith in their  leadership and their leadership is george w bush and the administration and the generals that are  in charge the joint chiefs of staff now i came back uh watching these kids these kids were just 
[04:07:00]  fantastic i mean they're they stepped up to the plate and they're getting the job done things are  happening over there trust me we are winning this war big time and i got back in the first morning i  i jump out of the rack and i turn on tv and here's ted kennedy saying the morale for our troops is at  an all-time low in iraq and you know what i didn't see kennedy over there any place when i was there  here here he was all i saw was great morale and and all i hear from this jerk is morale is at an all-time 
[04:07:30]  low you know if if it was going to be at an all-time low that would be exactly why right there because  you know one unit doesn't have any idea what the morale is like uh 50 miles away in another unit it  may be at an all-time low as far as this as far as this unit knows so ted kennedy somebody of authority  in our government a high prestigious individual comes on and comes on and they hear him saying 
[04:08:00]  morale is all at an all-time low the troops are thinking gosh maybe my unit's the only unit in iraq  that has great morale maybe everybody else's morale is at an all-time low my god maybe we should get our  morale under control and get it back down where it should be well i hope our military um wouldn't  listen to ted kennedy with much uh well you know but it's it's our elected officials these people that  are supposed to be you know know knowledgeable and intelligent and sharp it seems to me like i'm 
[04:08:30]  not real pleased about uh the administration i mean i i would have rather had somebody to vote for  last time yeah you know absolutely i'm not i'm not happy at all with uh nick romney i think is brilliant  have you listened to any of his stuff you know he's been talking and he's been on tv and i think he is  the brightest most squared away patriotic individual that i have seen in government for years and i'm  thinking nick uh mcromney might be the guy that we might want to look at next time of course he's 
[04:09:00]  i'm gonna have to listen to him a lot longer you know and find out some background history and  people never seem to want to do is really take a look at both sides or or listen to uh one guy's  opinion if it isn't such a staunch party line if you don't believe the way they believe they won't  listen to you right yeah well i i've of course out in hollywood you know we have a few of those out  there that uh liberal off the deep end i i don't mind i barbara's one of my favorites who writes on 
[04:09:30]  her blog and lives in our gated house never goes out to see what the real world is all about yet she  knows what solves everything how everything should be run that's where i'm different i do get out in the  real world yeah i've been half my life with the troops i take the word of somebody that's been  around and under fire with the troops than i will any politician or entertainer i've found out that  you're very polite and you will stand there uh independent or republican will actually stand there and 
[04:10:00]  listen uh while uh a deep end uh far off the deep end on the left uh liberal uh tells you all about  how he feels about it and this is the way that i see it and that and then when it and you'll listen  to him for five or ten minutes doing his thing and then when it comes your turn to explain how you  feel about it you get about one sentence into your explanation and they cut you off they literally will 
[04:10:30]  not listen to you so uh how can they make an opinion they can't you know i think we have a problem like  that though on both sides uh with the far right and the far left i think both sides you get i agree  but uh on the far left it's worse yeah it's worse and they don't have they don't have a lot of common  sense i found that out well that's a lot of a lot of the talk shows are gone just kill them all  just kill the bastards line them up just just dig a big old hole you know as a matter of fact we could 
[04:11:00]  make some something out of them and possibly build that wall down on our southern borders with those bodies  you know with the bodies of nobody want to come near that stench stench and that fly mess and  maggots love this guy but uh you know that's another thing cracks me up here we are faced with an  invasion from the south and i do mean an invasion they closed down all the uh half of the emergency  rooms in in southern california are bankrupt they've closed them down yeah uh and if you do have a  problem like i had a a situation where i i had a blood clot and i was paralyzed on the left side and i went to 
[04:11:30]  the emergency room you realize that uh out there the illegals are given free medical care only if  they go to the emergency rooms so if they have a cold they go to the emergency rooms i took a number  i was number 87 um and and i sat there and i waited and i waited and i waited and i waited and here was  these little uh hispanic kids with the sniffles and you know that is ridiculous and we need to do 
[04:12:00]  something about it but i have a solution and and and it's as simple as saying in the world why not  enforce the damn laws that we have on the books that says you can't hire them is anyone asking for  anything more that isn't in place already it's like just it's that's why it's called illegal i hear  this i hear this illegal billion dollar wall thing what's up with this i mean come on they dig holes  for christ's sakes they have holes that they've dug under the border yeah that are uh a thousand 
[04:12:30]  feet long tunnels yeah yeah huge tunnels and what's do you think a wall is going to stop them from  tunneling uh do you what they need to do is i did a show here last year year before last it was the blimp  and and they can take this blimp that they've they've come up with it's uh lighter than air type blimp you  can't shoot them down you punch a hole in it it it slowly leaks out and it slowly you'll have to  bring it home but it doesn't just crash now they can take these blimps and and they cost about a 
[04:13:00]  fourth or a tenth of what a helicopter would cost plus a helicopter it's up there for three hours and  it has to come back and get maintenance and refuels uh this blimp can go up you can put two crews on  it it can stay up there three days it's got two little piper cub engines it burns nothing for gas you  can put all the optical equipment and and uh heat registering uh what do they call that red infrared  infrared and all this and it can see a hundred miles in each direction how many would we need you 
[04:13:30]  know and and that's all we really need to do is have somebody out there we don't need to put more  border patrols on we just need to have that eye in the sky that can be watching day and night and when  they see activity in one certain area grid of the border they call and left the border patrol knows  so that the border control can come and control it and control the border but uh it would be the  simplest thing in the world wouldn't it and they're talking about this multi-billion dollar wall what's 
[04:14:00]  this big ass 40 foot high concrete barrier that's uh that reminds me of the there was a similar  situation between uh east and west berlin weren't there yeah then we didn't like that very well  didn't like that too much well uh hopefully they'll consider that idea the blimp the blimp it's such an  old idea yet it works it's advertising on the side like right they can sleep in it nike the gondola you  know is huge you can sleep in it there's quarter sleeping quarters so you can have two crews up there 
[04:14:30]  and stay up there two days in a row not like a helicopter go out for three hours and come back  i go out and come back that the uh people uh the the people jumping across the borders watching  these helicopters when they leave they know well they're gone for a couple hours now so we're wide  open let's go boys charge blimp it be quiet yeah totally quiet i say you fill a few up with a  hydrogen like the hindenburg and crash them right out of illegal aliens trying to do that but but and 
[04:15:00]  another thing is enforce the law we have laws in the books that says you can't hire an illegal alien  but you can't hire you you try to go over to another country say great britain or or france or  any other civilized country you go over there and try to get a job what i want to do that no no but but  try it yeah you can't give it a try they won't let you work you know but the americans won't do the  jobs the mexicans will do here though that's the thing no no see you have that wrong you've heard 
[04:15:30]  you've listened to ted kennedy too much he says my uncle he says yeah he says that the illegals come  across and they do the jobs that nobody no americans will do but he leaves off the last part  to that for two dollars and fifty cents an hour right of course americans will do those jobs but  not for two dollars and fifty cents an hour like the illegals will you know that's the difference right  there so can you just go to a marine base and get a tank could you personally just go walk in and go 
[04:16:00]  could i get a tank i want to drive no i could use one because that would i could probably go on any  any marine base that has uh has uh abrams a1 battle tanks and just go probably let me use one say could  we go for a ride and they would be more than happy to and load it up maybe you have that around at your  disposal is hysterical i love it i love the fact they should just let every illegal know that that's  possible that arlie ermie might be somewhere in a tank right now will you and then release tapes of 
[04:16:30]  this program uh to them to let them know that you might be out there in a tank you know i have all the  respect in the world for the for the folks that have come over here legally done the paperwork and  and done it right my simulation my son married a filipino my wife's a filipino and uh i i kind of  was wanting him to i was kind of pushing him in that direction so he's been going on vacation with  his mom for the past few years and he finally fell in love with a family old family friend and 
[04:17:00]  and uh they got married in january do you realize that they're still working on her paperwork and  they can't they haven't been able to get her back wow now married and they're married so here  meanwhile we have all the illegals flooding on board and the big question is do we give them  driver's licenses uh do we give them education you know those are already decided things of course we  do but how about my son's wife that's what i'd like they have tunnels you can get her through i  should have done that i should have just brought her to mexico and just just whipped uh whisked her 
[04:17:30]  across the border could probably just get a bunch of like some elite squad rappel down grab  her up shopper back in but it's the aggravating it's just aggravating to know that you know we're  doing it the legal way because i insist there's no other way as far as i'm concerned but in the  meanwhile we got all these people that are totally violating our laws the minute they step across our  borders uh do you realize that vicente fox of course has been dumping his garbage in our backyard 
[04:18:00]  ever since yep he got he so he's got a rapist a three-time committer what does he do he doesn't  submit committing to prison because then the mexican government has to feed him let's just you are  going to america young man there you go and they escort him up to the up to the border and he comes  over here and rapes a few people over here have our criminals oh yeah criminals they say a good uh like  30 percent of the people in prison in california are illegal aliens come on give me a break why are we 
[04:18:30]  supporting need why are we putting up with this crap well let's just raise taxes so we can give  them all color tv and they're personalized it is aggravating it is it's aggravating there's so much  wrong going on in this country and it doesn't and it seems like the democrats and the republicans  the left and the right are doing everything they can they're they're jockeying for that vote  they want that illegal that 12 million votes uh yeah and they're willing to sell us the american  people out to get that 12 million votes and it's disgusting i'm starting to really get upset with 
[04:19:00]  them but there's some good things too you know the government does a lot of great things and i'm  i'm proud of our government we do have the best government in the world i've lived in a lot of  foreign countries and i'll tell you what give me america and give me this government any day of the  we just a few little problems and that's texas chainsaw and that's what the movie is about right  that's what the movie is about guys 
[04:19:30]  but i'm serious about texas chainsaw massacre it's better than it's better than the other one and if  you enjoyed the last one which was a raging success you need to go see this one and and this  one i get to go totally berserk in so i would i would i would get the dvd of the first one first and  then go to the movies and see the second i would watch the prequel yeah the remake first too and  then then you have all these questions you know well how'd this happen how'd that come about whatever  happened yeah for this you know uh so i recommend that but by all means go and see texas chainsaw
