<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a best-of compilation from their 4th of July vacation, featuring studio guest Dee Dee.  The show heavily focused on sexually explicit conversations with Dee Dee, encompassing topics such as spanking, anal sex, menstruation, and various sexual preferences.  Sue Johansson, a "granny sexpert" from the Oxygen Channel, provided sex advice, including recommendations on using lubricant instead of baby oil for masturbation, prompting further commentary on the absurdity of her suggestions.  Listener calls added to the sexually charged atmosphere, with callers posing explicit questions to Dee Dee.

The broadcast also addressed the "assault on the media" campaign, highlighting the firing of News Channel 2 reporter Arthur Chen.  Chen was disrupted during a live report by two men promoting the show, leading to an on-air outburst ("What the fuck is your problem, man?") and his subsequent termination.  Opie and Anthony, who were on vacation at the time, played audio clips from various news outlets covering the incident, emphasizing the contradictory portrayals of their involvement and Chen's outburst.  They also promoted merchandise related to the incident, including "What the fuck is your problem, man?" t-shirts and "Spread the Virus" shirts. Listener calls provided varied opinions on the matter, along with accounts of other "assaults" involving a nude woman and the C-word.  The hosts also discussed the media's coverage, mentioning Tom Schnitz's commentary and referencing Howard Stern and Imus.  A future segment called "Serious Questions Only" was promoted.

The show then transitioned into an in-studio interview with Adam and Jamie from Mythbusters.  The conversation began with a recollection of a previous show featuring Ben's exposed "giant hog."  Vos, filling in for Jimmy, was noted for falling asleep during the interview.  Adam and Jamie discussed their show's origins, memorable myths they'd busted (including dynamite cleaning cement, a jet engine flipping a car, the Alcatraz escape, and cell phones igniting gas), their experimental process, and on-set mishaps.  They also talked about the show's expansion and increasing popularity, interspersed with listener calls sharing favorite myths and questions.  Further anecdotes about the show, including a decomposing pig in a car and bug bombs, were also discussed.  The segment briefly mentioned other show bits like "yogurt lid wars" and Anthony's oldies radio DJ impersonation before concluding with advertisements.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on two key areas: the deceptive practices of commercial radio DJs regarding song requests, and a satirical attack on rival station CBS FM.  The hosts deconstructed the illusion of live song requests on commercial radio, contrasting it with their own approach.  The bulk of this segment was dedicated to a prolonged, highly offensive and vulgar parody of CBS FM's style, fueled by a previous on-air slight involving a monkey joke.  This extended parody, lasting an hour and a half, included invented offensive on-air personalities and dialogue filled with sexually explicit and offensive content, along with exaggerated sound effects.  Listener calls reacted to the parody and contributed to the discussion on commercial radio practices, with one listener criticizing their take on a crab fishing reality show, leading to further offensive tangents.  The segment concluded with a discussion about gravity, featuring a playful, informal debate between the hosts about the determining factors of planetary gravity.

The show continued with a discussion about gravity, sparked by a comment about Mars' lack of atmosphere.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy debated the role of a planet's mass and rotation, with listener calls offering scientific and humorous input.  The conversation drifted to centrifugal force and the hypothetical attraction of larger individuals to smaller ones.  The hosts used offensive language extensively.  A substantial portion focused on the color of Anthony's shirt, leading to online image searches and offensive jokes.  The discussion then shifted to breastfeeding in public, fueled by Barbara Waltersâ€™ discomfort, resulting in further vulgar and offensive commentary from the hosts and callers, referencing a previous guest who breastfed her adult son.  The show ended with discussion of the Barbara Walters controversy and a promotion for the "O&A Party Rock."

A subsequent segment focused on breastfeeding in public, featuring vulgar and sexually explicit commentary about breastfeeding, including jokes about baby feces and breast appearance.  The conversation then pivoted to a lawsuit against a New York City gym alleging rampant homosexual activity in the locker room, with the hosts and callers engaging in numerous sexually explicit jokes and homophobic slurs.  Anecdotes about locker room encounters, including descriptions of nudity and sexual acts, were shared.  A caller recounted a sexual encounter in a women's locker room.  The show concluded with a performance by comedian Stephen Lynch, who sang a song about Jesus's brother, Craig.

The broadcast concluded with a comedic song or spoken-word piece about "Craig Christ," a profane parody of Jesus Christ, using the phrase "fuckin' Craig" repeatedly.  Steven Lentz announced the show's end, with concluding remarks from the hosts expressing frustration about the broadcast's conclusion.

[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  You're listening to the worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  It's absolutely awful.  Hey guys, we're on vacation.  Yeah.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Jimmy Norton.  What's this vacation for?  I think right about now we're watching fireworks somewhere. 
[00:04:30]  Is it a whole 4th of July vacation thing?  I believe so, I believe so, yes.  I hope you don't lose a limb this 4th of July weekend.  How could you lose a limb?  You can't get fireworks anymore.  They crack down like crazy.  Now it's all this, you gotta go to a public thing, the city runs.  Used to be a couple of drunks next door with M-80s and aerial bombs and big rockets.  That's fun stuff.  You read the paper the next day and it was just loaded with people that lost their hands. 
[00:05:00]  Or the mortar guy.  Stupid mortar guy that lights the fuse, drops his 6-inch mortar in the tube and nothing happens.  So he decides to take a peek.  Right in his face.  Love it.  I love that too, Anthony.  All right, so we got some worst-up crap for you guys.  Dee Dee, we love Dee Dee.  She does the news when we go to Washington.  Yeah.  And we also love that granny sexpert that we talk about from time to time.  Sue Johansson.  Yeah, the grandma that gives out the sex advice.  This was a very, very fun appearance by Dee Dee in studio when we were in Washington. 
[00:05:30]  So take a listen.  I'm the worst of Opian Anthony.  Here's Opian Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opian Anthony.  You want to do one of these sex advice things while Dee Dee's in the studio?  Sure.  Sue Johansson.  Oh, Dr. Sue Johansson from Oxygen Channel.  She's a trip.  Oh, you know her?  Yes. 
[00:06:00]  You like her?  She plays with those two dolls.  The blue doll and the red doll.  The blue doll's for the boy and the red doll's for the girl.  Really?  She does these positions.  She's a trip.  I've only heard clips of her.  I haven't seen the show.  Oxygen Channel.  Yeah, I don't even know what that is on my cable provider.  It's not supposed to be hilarious, though, is it?  Right next to the soap sale channel.  It's funny because she told one guy...  Oh, I'll save it.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Okay, one day this guy called up about butt plugs and she said,  And try it while you're vacuuming. 
[00:06:30]  I just thought that was funny.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  She told the guy to just try it out while he was vacuuming.  You sure she wasn't talking about butt plug removal?  No, she...  Or try the vacuum.  No, she said, try it out while you're vacuuming.  You may like it.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm funny.  And you love this show, huh?  Maybe it's for women.  You know what?  It's funny.  I think it's hilarious. 
[00:07:00]  I would like to get through and ask her...  I don't know.  Come up with a...  What would you want to ask her?  I don't know.  Yeah, what would you ask Sue Johansson?  I think you do know.  The grandma that gives out sex advice.  I don't know what I would ask her,  but it would be fun to get through to her and just make up something.  What would you make up?  I'm sure if you're on the phone, you'd have to think on the fly.  You've thought about this.  No, I haven't.  Yes, you have.  No, I haven't.  You should do sex advice with Dee Dee.  It's not a bad idea.  Dee Dee's a pervert.  Dee Dee is a little filthy pervert.  I'm not a pervert just because of the whip.  You like to be whipped and have nipple clamps and cock rings. 
[00:07:30]  You are a filthy girl.  You're a dirty girl.  Okay, and who has hookers?  Oh, I'm awful.  I know I'm awful.  I love these two, man.  There's something going on here.  I know.  Actually, somebody did send me an email.  I have to forward it to you guys.  He photoshopped mine in his face.  Really?  Really?  Of you two going at it?  Well, like we're getting married or something and it probably comes out of it.  See, you guys, you two definitely live in the same world.  Yes, we do.  And you both know it.  That's what I love about what I see going on here.  I don't think there's any real attraction here, but you could... 
[00:08:00]  Oh, gee, I know what Dee Dee wants.  I know what Dee Dee wants.  You guys can relate to each other.  What do I want, too?  Dee Dee wants a good bottom red knee.  Yeah.  She knows I'd redden her bottom properly.  She knows it.  Of course she knows it.  How could she not know it?  She likes getting that ass slapped.  Of course she does.  But not by everybody.  I know that.  But she understands that I'd spank her properly.  Dee Dee definitely understands that.  Would you let Jimmy spank you properly?  No, she understands what I would do.  I'd slide the pants down a little bit.  You know, you spank and then you just make sure... 
[00:08:30]  This is what you do.  Then you part the thighs a little bit gently  and you make sure the person's not getting wet.  If the person's getting wet, you spank them harder because...  Because that's a no-no.  And they know they're not supposed to get wet and they get wetter.  It's just a reality.  Wow, Jimmy.  Maybe you can slap the...  He heave into it.  You know he is.  He knows a lot about it.  That's the truth.  You make sure that you tell them, don't...  Do not get...  You know?  And that makes them get wet, right, Dee Dee?  Of course it does.  You pull the panties tight.  She's trying to fan herself right now.  She knows it's true that you hold the panties.  The first panties, you pull them tight. 
[00:09:00]  Between the lips.  Not too hard.  Just a little bit of pressure, you know?  Is that true, Dee Dee?  Of course it's true.  Sure.  Talk sex with Sue Johanson.  It's on the Oxygen channel.  She's a grandma and she's just awful with her advice.  But Dee Dee seems to like it.  You've got to watch her.  It's seeing her play with the dolls.  All right.  Let's listen to this bit of advice.  Hey.  What's up?  Hi, Brianna.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Good.  You've got a question.  Yes.  I'm 18 years old.  Yeah?  And I've just noticed I'm hornier than a lot of my friends. 
[00:09:30]  Is this normal?  And is it okay to masturbate with baby oil?  Yep.  Yes and yes.  Okay.  Now, masturbation for females.  I mean, you're 18.  I'm sorry it took you 18 years to learn how to do it, but...  No, I did it a long time ago.  What did she get the idea that she took her that long?  She just said she's 18 and she masturbates.  Didn't say, I just started.  She has that owl disease. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Owl's disease.  She's got the owl's disease.  Oh, Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Right.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Whatever.  I'm saying it fast now.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Okay, say it.  It's Alzheimer's.  Whatever.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  All right.  No, I did it a long time ago.  Okay.  Well, then that's good.  It's fine.  Now, when you masturbate, do you pleasure yourself?  Do you reach orgasm?  Yes. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, good.  All right.  That's real good.  Now, and you're worried about what?  That might get sick if I use baby oil because I'm too ashamed to go buy the regular stuff.  Now, you know what?  The trouble with baby oil is that it has perfume in it, you know?  It smells nice.  And baby oil, you can get...  Some women develop an allergic reaction to the baby oil because it's got the perfume in it.  So, why don't you go to any drugstore, any drugstore at all, and pick up a bottle of ordinary garden variety lubricant. 
[00:11:00]  They're not that expensive.  They'll last you forever and ever.  And you just open the top up and squish them on your hands and use that for lubrication rather than baby oil.  Baby oil smells nice, but that's a problem because it's got perfume.  Okay, Brianna. 
[00:11:30]  Good.  I'm glad we got your call in because that was obviously something that was worrying you.  That is awful advice.  She said she's embarrassed.  It's obvious advice.  Yeah.  DeeDee?  It wasn't bad advice.  The girl was afraid, you know, she was embarrassed.  She doesn't want to go to a drugstore, though, and pick up lube.  That's why she uses the baby oil.  She just needs to get over that and go get.  And it all depends if she's still living at home with the parents.  You can't have KY around in your house. 
[00:12:00]  If there's baby oil around, then, you know, it's baby oil.  It could be used for anything.  Right.  But the perfume thing is a good point, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  People can be allergic to perfume.  Yeah.  What?  Perfume.  Perfume.  Perfume.  No, you're right.  I mean, because perfumes have definitely perfumes.  I actually agree with you.  You're absolutely right.  Because a lot of times, unscented things are fine, but if you're going to put perfumes  in something, then you absolutely should just put the accent wherever you feel it goes. 
[00:12:30]  The way the rest of the country pronounces something is irrelevant.  You know?  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Say it again.  That I talk different.  No, you don't.  I'm secure with my speech impediment now, man.  Absolutely.  You guys should have the kids together.  Your tongue's a mess.  Are you going to put perfumes in?  What?  Perfume.  Perfume.  Perfume.  Perfume.  Yeah.  Because I think a cartoon's speeding by voice.  Pfume.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug from Whack Bag.  What's up, Doug?  Hi, Doug. 
[00:13:00]  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning, DeeDee.  Good morning, Doug.  I love you.  I love your show.  I am my kid's mom.  I have a question for you.  For me or for them?  I have a question for you, DeeDee.  I have a sex advice question for you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, God.  Well, you see, due to the increased sensitivity during the menstrual cycle, I do enjoy very  much crime scene sex.  During that time, usually, when you pull out, you get like a flaky consistency mixed with 
[00:13:30]  blood chunks.  Ew.  And this last time when I was doing it, when I pulled out, it was more like a blood-soaked  rice pudding.  Ew.  Oh, God.  That's just wrong.  I was wondering if that was quite possibly a yeast infection at the same time.  Oh, good question.  I don't know.  Ew.  DeeDee, you into the crime scene sex?  No.  Ew.  Good girl.  Ew.  Where you have to put a tarp down?  No. 
[00:14:00]  No?  Yuck, yuck.  I will not do it while I'm on my ant flow, no.  You don't need that all over satin sheets, right?  No.  You're going to have sex.  So what do you do when you're having your flow?  Well, duh, anal, probably.  Wow.  Of course.  Well, of course.  Wow.  Thank God.  Most people say nothing.  Stupid me, right?  Yeah.  I just take Mideol and relax.  And apparently, you know, the asshole store is open.  Well, if I'm with the guy and he really, really wants something, well, that's all he's  going to get while I'm on my ant flow. 
[00:14:30]  Jesus, DeeDee.  That must be a lovely scene.  Wow.  Blood dripping.  Like you're just string hanging out.  No, because if you have a tampon on, it's not going to drip.  You're right.  All right.  Well, you're right.  Well, I'm just, I mean, you know, it's not going to drip.  You know, I have to, I just picture if you flip over on your belly and your most intimate  is kind of laying there on the sheets, bleeding.  Does it look like a boxer freshly knocked out?  Like, you know how the mouth kind of is open a little and the little blood is coming out? 
[00:15:00]  Look down there.  And sometimes the cut man does, you know, throw some cotton and stuff in the mouth.  Yeah, that's true.  Stop the bleeding.  Some of that cotton starts hanging out a little bit.  You're there with your face in the pillow, your keister up in the air.  Oh, nice.  Keister.  I found myself recently in a supermarket in the tampon section.  And, man, you girls have a lot of choices for tampons, I noticed. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to come in with the list of the choices for you girls.  You want me to go through the list?  Oh, you know the list?  I don't know.  Okay.  I know there was one.  Kotex.  No, no, no, no.  But there were certain ones like Gentle Glide.  Oh, yeah, the plastic Gentle Glide.  Why?  Wouldn't your choices end there if you're a woman and you're looking for a tampon?  You want it to be gentle and to glide.  You want it gentle and, yeah, you want it to glide in nice.  What other choices could there possibly be that are going to beat out the Gentle Glide? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, what's another popular sell?  The sandpaper fish hook?  No, there's just, like, there's cardboard ones, too, which is why they still make them.  I don't know.  It looks like a push-up.  One of those push-up pop things.  It does.  Yeah, a big cardboard tube.  But they have those marketing words.  I'll have to do my research over the weekend, and I'll come in with a whole list.  You do that.  Research that over this weekend, Opie.  Well, just because some of them are hilarious.  I can't remember anymore, but one was Gentle Glide.  And I'm thinking if you're a woman, that's... 
[00:16:30]  Playtex, I think, yeah.  But what are some of the other ones?  Like extra...  There's, like...  Extra crispy?  Yeah.  What?  No, you mean for the different, like, if you're moderate, if you're heavy, it's stuff like that.  Oh, my God, dude.  It was...  It was like...  It was...  There's a lot.  There's...  It made me dizzy.  Yeah.  You think there's a lot of choices for cereal in the supermarket these days?  Oh, my God.  There's wings, too, on the...  On the pads.  The wings, they wrap around the panties and keep them from flowing over the edge.  Oh, is that what that's winged mean?  Yeah.  I never investigated that. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, sure.  You put the...  You lay the pad on the panty, and then the wings, like, stick underneath, kind of on the  side, so no leakage spills on the side.  Well, now, what...  Let me ask.  You were saying heavy.  What do they do with a heavy flow?  It's like a certain...  It's a larger tampon.  Does it come with, like, a little string and a needle?  I just think it's funny that you're talking about wings.  Wings.  Flying on the wings of a maxi.  Sew it up.  Looks like a catcher's mitt.  Have you ever allowed a guy to get... 
[00:17:30]  Especially stuffed turkey.  Oh, God.  Have you ever allowed a guy to get his red wings?  No.  No?  I know what...  No.  It goes down on you.  It looks like he's been drinking grape juice.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  I told you.  I don't like that when I...  No.  No?  No.  When Amplos visited me, no.  Or it looks like he's stuck his face in a cherry pie.  Oh, God.  You look like a victim of the Jonestown Massacre.  You're just laying there, drugged out, and Kool-Aid on your face.  No.  No. 
[00:18:00]  And you'd prefer to be one?  No.  You'd rather just flip it over.  No.  That's one thing I've never done, and I probably won't.  Wow.  Never let a guy do it during that.  No.  I don't blame you.  Good for you.  You'll roll over on your belly.  That's right.  Someone has a very good question for Dee Dee.  Oh, God.  Let me go to, let's see, Andy in New York City.  Hi, Andy.  Andy.  Andy.  Yeah.  Andy.  Andy.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  How are you, sweet kids? 
[00:18:30]  Hi, Mr. Let's not, let's keep the insults out.  I'm sorry.  Dee Dee, I have a sex question for you.  I was wondering if you like the trifecta, going from the front to the rear right to the mouth.  Oh, good question.  Dee Dee, are you into the ass-to-mouth, the trifecta?  No.  You don't do ass-to-mouth?  No.  No, if it's down there.  No, it's a little weird.  It's got to be cleaned off before, you know.  Oh, hell yeah.  It's got to go from the reverse.  You've got to start with the mouth, then vag, then the back door. 
[00:19:00]  Nah, Jimmy, if you do it the other way.  God, Jimmy.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm saying for hygienic purposes.  Right.  Nah, but if you do it the original, if you do it the original way, you call it the triple  crown.  I'm not saying you're wrong in theory, sir.  I'm not saying the humiliation factor isn't sexy and hilarious.  I'm just saying.  Punch it out, boys.  Bye, Mr. Nice.  Let's go to Michigan.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hey.  Love the show.  Hey.  Thank you. 
[00:19:30]  Hi, fella.  Hey.  We call that a chili dog.  When you go from the ass to the mouth, that's what we refer to as a chili dog.  A buddy of mine's got a girl that just loves that.  What's a chili dog exactly?  Oh, you put it in her backside and then you pull it out and put it in her mouth.  Right.  Ugh.  Jesus.  I put it in her mouth.  I put it in her mouth.  I put it in her mouth.  I put it in her mouth.  Can you not say it?  You got a mission from God?  That's awful.  A mission from God.  And then you put it in the mouth. 
[00:20:00]  Put it in her mouth.  The sisters of mercy.  All right.  How you doing?  Cool.  All right.  One more here and then we'll go back to Sue Johansson.  Penn and, uh, Penn, Jesus.  Ben in Pennsylvania.  Ben?  Ben?  Good morning, boys.  What's up?  Where?  Hey, um, that old guy that's in the house.  Gonday.  Who is this?  Who is KSS?  What was the, who is this?  Oh, Donde.  Donde.  Donde.  Go ahead, Ben.  Hey, uh, that old brother was giving the advice. 
[00:20:30]  Did she actually ask that girl if she masturbates to go to orgasm?  Who on planet Earth doesn't masturbate to go to orgasm?  Oh, my God.  You'll spend the whole afternoon until you, uh, reach your goal.  You've got to finish up.  Punch out.  All right.  You'll be chafed beyond, uh, recognition as long as you get to the end there.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, do another one from Sue Johansson.  The magical sperm she talks about here, Anthony.  Magical.  Magical.  Yes.  My husband tells me that, um, sperm is good for my hair. 
[00:21:00]  Is this true?  Samantha.  Samantha.  Yes.  Yeah.  No.  It's not.  You know what?  That's the first time I've ever heard that line.  I have heard a lot of lines about the wonderful, pretty.  You know what, though?  Yeah.  We did a whole bit, uh, a few years back.  There was a shampoo that came out.  Yeah.  That had sperm in it.  That had some kind of sperm.  And they claim that, uh, made the shampoo better.  Yeah.  What the hell was the name of that shampoo? 
[00:21:30]  It was legit and everything.  Bob.  Oh, man.  We had fun with that, remember?  Mm.  All right.  Whatever.  Let's go back.  It's about the wonderful fringe benefits of ejaculate.  And one of them is that if you rub it on your face, it'll clear up your acne.  Ew.  If you swallow it, it'll give you big boobs.  I have heard that if you swallow it, it will eliminate menstrual cramps. 
[00:22:00]  Make you a good girl.  I have heard that it's, it's diet food because there's only 35 calories in one teaspoon, but  I have never heard that it'll make your hair shine and look lustrous.  Otherwise, you know what?  Our pubic hair would be, oh, just glistening.  I don't think so, Samantha.  All right.  Thank you.  Nice try, though.  And up.  You've got to give, you've got to give him credit for, uh, for innovation.  All right? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  That's the jack in her hair.  He probably shot at her hair and she complained and he went, ah, it's good for your hair.  Don't worry.  It's fine.  No, I heard one thing.  I don't know if it's true.  I heard that there's, like, protein in it.  Yes, that's true.  And it's good, like, when you do swallow it.  That's what I was told a long time ago.  Do you?  I don't know if that's true.  What do you do with it?  You spit?  No, you swallowed.  She obviously swallowed.  Well, I have to know the guy.  Oh, please.  Oh, stop.  Seriously.  If you don't know him, what do you just spit it back in his face? 
[00:23:00]  Right out the car window?  I don't, yeah.  Only with certain guys I would do that.  Only certain guys?  Do you ever, like, hang out and spit out the window and almost get your head cut off  by some random cable?  No.  Do you take it on the face?  I'm not going to answer that.  No.  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  It's a no.  You fell right into our trap.  That's a yes.  Whenever anyone says, I'm not going to answer that, that means the answer is yes.  No.  I bet you Dee Dee likes to have, like, a man getting ready to finish and her arms being 
[00:23:30]  pinned down by her side while he straddles her shoulders and chest, so you have that feeling  of helplessness, and then he just kind of gives it to you.  God damn, he's good.  Yeah, you guys live in the same world.  I'm going to say it again.  I see it.  It's so obvious.  Because you're nodding like, yeah, yeah, exactly, Jim.  Exactly.  I'm like, holy shit.  You got those cute glasses on.  You ever let a guy finish on the glasses, and then you're like, oh, I can't see, I can't  see.  I don't wear glasses while I'm having sex.  A little cocky.  Pukanky. 
[00:24:00]  That's it.  All right, well, now we have, this is a very interesting contrast we have going on today.  We have the sex advice from the grandma, Sue Johansson, and then we got our callers calling  in to ask Dee Dee's sex questions.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, hey, Dee Dee.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good.  I wanted to ask Dee Dee if there's anything special that she does to prepare herself for  an evening of anal pleasures. 
[00:24:30]  Dee Dee?  That's a very good question.  It certainly is.  Do you prep for anal?  Anima?  Well, so it's not a sore?  Yeah, sure.  I guess, yeah.  Toy, you start with a toy?  Yeah, well, what kind of stuff do you do?  Yeah, how do you prep?  Yeah, how do you prep for the anal there, Dee Dee?  Thank you.  You know you're going to have anal tonight.  What do you do that's a little special?  What do you do besides turn every family photo around backwards?  You stay away from White Castle for a couple days? 
[00:25:00]  What do you do?  That's all you need is sliders in your pubes.  Jesus.  Your crotch smells like a drunk's car at four in the morning on a Saturday.  I don't know if I do anything special.  It's just like...  There's a burger place in New York.  We've talked about it, I guess, but what the hell is the name of it?  These burgers don't last more than 20 minutes in you.  Oh, gosh.  And they're the best burgers ever.  They're all over Manhattan.  Greasy.  Like in Jersey, it's the White Rose system. 
[00:25:30]  It's just like those awful...  These things.  Jackson Hole.  Jackson Hole burgers.  Thanks, Ann.  And you take that first bite, and you just feel your stomach already percolating.  Yeah.  It's like...  But they're great, right?  They're amazing.  And the first time I went in there, I wondered why there was a line to the bathroom.  And I found out...  They're actually handing you burgers while you're sitting.  There you go.  Chew.  Swallow.  I mean, White Castle's pretty bad, but these Jackson Hole burgers,  you can get them like 200 different ways. 
[00:26:00]  They have every version of the burger imaginable,  and these things do not stay in you whatsoever.  But anyway, back to Deedee.  Deedee, how do you prepare the back door for the anal?  You mean so I'm like, no, it's coming?  Mentally, physically.  Mentally.  You clean up.  You try to think it isn't possible that dead relatives are watching you.  What?  That what?  You don't think of your grandparents watching you.  I've always thought of that.  Dropping in from heaven.  Oh, God.  Let me see what...  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:26:30]  She's got her face in a pillow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You couldn't...  My grandma would have a heartache.  It's in her ass.  Weird.  Weird.  Right.  Why is she putting it there?  Oh, God.  She doesn't go there.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'd like to believe that we go somewhere after this life, but, man, if they're looking  at us, ugh.  Oh, God, I hope not.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Well, give my condolences to her sphincter. 
[00:27:00]  I was just raising her.  Yeah, you're raising her.  Come on, D.D.  Hop in.  All right, well...  Here's the deal.  You're going to have anal.  You don't want the guy using your drapes after he's done.  Oh.  Oh.  So, what do you do?  Well, like, so...  Because I get tense a little bit, because it does hurt.  Of course.  Tell us more.  Timmy knows.  Look, see.  You have to.  God.  He doesn't with such a puffy little face. 
[00:27:30]  Like, you've got that cute little puppy dog boy thing, and then you talk about hookers.  Oh, well.  I'm not talking about hookers.  I'm just talking about regular chances.  No, but...  You just have this innocence.  Never mind.  I'm a good boy.  So, to get me, like, to be less tense...  He'll do a little bit of something first.  Mouth and hand, maybe?  Finger.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  That kind of loosened me up a little bit, and then I feel okay to...  Well, the hand's perfect.  You start with the pinky, and slowly work your way up to the thumb. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Fist, a couple of...  I'm not used to, like, corkula.  Corkula!  Then you get the other fist in there, and then you clap, and then you're ready.  A little lard.  So, if you start like that, so I'll get, like, less tense.  You know you're ready when he starts going.  In the name of the people in the Senate...  Wait, in the name of the Senate, the people of Rome.  Oh, God.  Aproculus.  So, that's how I get set up for that.  All right.  Very nice.  Yeah, loosen up the area a little bit.  Oh, God.  A lot of people want to know how many holes you've taken at one time. 
[00:28:30]  What?  Well, it's either one, two, or three.  Let's go.  At one time?  I'm usually with one guy, so...  Usually.  Usually?  Wow.  There was one time I was with two guys, and that was when I was in my 20s.  How was that?  Back in L.A., when I was, of course, still drinking.  Oh, that's...  All right, we're all going to sit back for this story.  Yeah, I'm throwing up a little bit.  Yeah.  All right, so you were with two guys.  Yeah.  Well, tell us more.  Well, I mean, it was my roommate, and somebody he knew, and it just kind of happened.  It wasn't meant to happen. 
[00:29:00]  It just happened.  Were you on the rotisserie?  No.  What were you doing?  Anthony came up with the best.  I forgot what it was, though, when a girl works two at one time.  Oh.  Wait, what did you...  Oh, the double pump?  Yeah.  But you had some kind of...  I forgot your analogy.  One of them was working the tank controls.  Right.  Right.  You know, grabbing on one with each hand.  That was tank controls.  Yeah.  Working some big rig equipment. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, right in the tank.  Some kind of front loader.  I had two holes there then.  Oh, wow.  What, mouth?  Yeah.  And then, wow, finger cups.  So you were on the rotisserie.  So...  Play cards on your back?  No.  Finger cups.  Whatever you got.  Yeah, finger cups.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Any more questions?  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, my God.  This guy has a great name for crime scene sex. 
[00:30:00]  I've never heard it called this before.  Let's see.  Let's go to Chainsaw the trucker.  Oh, God.  Chainsaw.  I'm no trucker.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  I was going to tell you, we call that eating a girl on the rag.  We call that Ronald McDonald's mouth.  Bravo.  Oh, brother.  That is what it's called now.  And how long is it going to take for someone to grab that name for...  Ronald McDonald's mouth.  Oh, there goes another screen name. 
[00:30:30]  There goes another screen name.  That's hilarious.  That is very funny.  Definitely going to call it that name.  Wait, what's this, Steve?  Lex and Terry what?  What, Steve?  I guess there's audio of Lex and Terry trashing you from today.  Woo!  That Eric just put in there.  All righty.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Always good when the Opie and Anthony name is mentioned.  We'll find that in a minute or two.  I hope they don't give it to us too hard.  I don't know if we can handle it. 
[00:31:00]  All right, you want another question for Sue Johanson here?  Yeah, let me hear.  Yeah.  Okay.  She discusses the dangers of labiaplasty.  What?  And labiaplasty is explained.  It's probably a surgery for shrinkage.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, my wife was curious about labiaplasty.  Is it safe and do you lose any sensation?  Yes.  Why does she want to do this? 
[00:31:30]  Uh, she's...  Is it safe?  Does you...  Do you lose any sensation?  Yes.  What the hell kind of answer is that, you old bag?  So safe you wouldn't believe it.  Is it safe?  No, no.  Very dangerous.  Very careful.  Very dangerous.  So safe you wouldn't believe it.  Enjoy your youth.  It's the last time no one will expect you to have a tight labia.  Uh, yeah, my wife was curious about labiaplasty.  Is it safe and do you lose any sensation? 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  Why does she want to do this?  Uh, she doesn't like them, says they bother her.  Now that, uh, she doesn't like them and they bother her.  Like, why do they bother her?  Um, I'm thinking just rubbing together, I guess.  And even if she has the size of her labia reduced, they won't rub together?  I guess. 
[00:32:30]  I don't have them, so I don't know.  I know.  I mean, I'd love to talk to her.  Yeah, I couldn't get her on the phone.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Use what you cut off in the beak and broccoli.  All right, let me talk to her then.  I'll talk through you to her.  My concern is, you know, any time you make an incision, you make a cut, you kill nerve endings.  Yeah.  Now, the labia have quite a few nerve endings, and they're very sexually, they're easy to stimulate. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So, if you have this kind of surgery, then, um, you're, you've lost that whole rim, ridge of nerve endings.  Okay.  And.  That's what I was concerned about.  Yeah.  And they, they're not bothering you.  No.  And nobody else can see them.  No.  So, I mean, I can understand having your nose bobbed or something like that, but labia, nobody can see them.  Her nose.  So.  Nobody. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Hmm.  It's not risky surgery, but, um.  This woman's talking out her ass.  It will reduce sensations.  Okay.  So, that's the best I can say to you.  She's been stumped, Anthony.  Yep.  All right.  Maybe I, maybe you can convince her.  Thanks a lot.  Okay, Joe.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  This is, this is.  Go ahead.  I guarantee her dumb husband thinks that her lips are too big and wants them to get it reduced. 
[00:34:00]  He's probably like, why don't you have that surgery?  And she's like, I don't know.  And then he's trying to find out this dummy she's married to is probably doesn't like her big labia.  Well, perhaps they're ridiculous big.  I know you like them big.  No such thing.  You know, if it looks like Bubba from Forrest Gump.  I like that.  I like that.  Perhaps, uh, she needs a little clipping.  No, she doesn't.  Tuck one into each sock and head on over.  I like that.  Hey, this is the game Triple H.  You are listening to the Kings of Satellite, Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, the assault on the media. 
[00:34:30]  We love this campaign.  Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.  Uh, this was the best one yet.  A reporter got fired because of us, Anthony.  Arthur Cheyenne.  Arthur Cheyenne.  Well, this is the first day back after the infamous assault on the media that got Arthur Cheyenne fired.  So why don't we listen again to this fine, fine piece of radio?  I don't like his name.  Why is there a comma in his name?  Exactly.  Doesn't a comma replace a letter that is supposed to be there?  If it's your name, why not just put the letter there? 
[00:35:00]  What would you put in there?  Cheyenne.  Probably an N and a K.  Holy S.  Just play the bit.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  They must have went to the bit by now, right? 
[00:35:30]  Well, no?  All right, go to it.  God damn, Jimmy.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  People wanted to kill us, I mean we have to back up, Thursday's show was just off the  charts and we're playing our first show ever, and then we just flat out ran out of time  because we were having so much fun with Dave Mordal and Voss and Bonnie and everybody. 
[00:36:00]  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  That, you know, Eric had me on the clock, there was like a countdown happening.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden I said something like, well this is going to have to wait until next time,  and then we got out of the show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we had to go.  We had to go.  And I was like, oh darn, darn it.  And someone's going, hey dude, no more vacation.  Hey, we gave you, let's see, almost a month and a half.  Vacation?  We almost did a month and a half before we had to take another day or two off.  A four day weekend does not a vacation make. 
[00:36:30]  No, you watch what happens after we only work three days this week.  Yeah, don't you sweat it.  Yeah.  We're giving you.  Oh my God, that's right.  We're giving you guys so much programming that we have to rest our little brains for a ton of time.  That's right.  We're very stressed.  God, we are just the kings of taking time off.  We have it down to our signs.  And then, you know, I'm already working the gang in Washington, how we're really tired and the creative process is getting to us. 
[00:37:00]  And we're doing the equivalent of a five-hour talk show because we don't play commercials.  So I think it's a really good thing that, you know, Anthony and I take a few more days off this summer.  And all of a sudden Eric Logan's like, dude, I haven't had a vacation since like 2002.  Shut up.  That's Elo.  He's a boss.  That's Elo.  Yeah, he's got to like run the whole ship.  Get in there.  Be the boss.  Don't worry about us.  Yeah, we took a little time. 
[00:37:30]  That's the problem.  We didn't tell our listeners.  Like it's our obligation to get on and tell our listeners.  We probably should have, though, because they speculate all weekend.  They did it again.  They did it again.  They're suspended.  And we all know how this turns out in the end.  We never know when things are going to pop up that really feeds the speculation.  And I had no clue that the reporter, that we had an assault on the media behind. 
[00:38:00]  When was that, Thursday?  That was Thursday.  It was Thursday.  That's what makes it so great, perfect timing.  We had no clue that he got fired for cursing on the air, using the F word.  We knew that story had some legs.  Yeah.  And boy, did it have legs.  It went all over the world.  Yes, it did.  I was reading our names in the China press.  Yeah, I was just about to say that.  I was reading our names in chinky writing.  The China press.  Little chinky writing. 
[00:38:30]  And the only words I could recognize were, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  That made the press in China?  Yeah.  I was attempting to read chinky, just to see what they had to say about us.  Would you stop?  Chinese.  Chinese, chinky, whatever.  Yeah, it made some kind of China press.  Yeah.  A little bit of trouble.  He got in a little bit of trouble there.  And I, you know, it's, again, Viacom, who owns CBS, buckles under and fires the guy. 
[00:39:00]  The guy should not have been fired for that.  It's, what, why can't people be human beings on television?  The guy was annoyed.  He spins around stupidly.  He was stupid.  He should have waited, you know, until the shot cleared.  Guy didn't even get the last sentence of the story out.  And he turns around and says, you know, what the fuck is your problem?  And, uh, it got, it got on the air. 
[00:39:30]  And, uh, Viacom, with their zero tolerance policy.  What?  I am so sick of the zero tolerance policy with anything.  The zero tolerance policy winds up getting people in trouble that aren't really doing anything wrong.  You know, if somebody's doing something wrong, you give them the boot.  The second you put a zero tolerance policy on it,  then you're suspending children for cutting a piece of bread to look like a gun and going bang, bang in the cafeteria.  Those are the people that get affected by zero tolerance policy. 
[00:40:00]  An honest mistake of a guy saying fuck on television where, you know, he should be reprimanded and perhaps, uh, taught how he should be on camera like that.  But firing him because of this zero tolerance policy, it's ridiculous.  And now the guy, you know, he's out of a job.  A lot of people are blaming us for it.  Which is sickening.  Which is ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Uh, you get on that New York radio message board.  Oh, Alan, yeah.  Ah, come on.  Alan's a little off on this one. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  There are times I agree with the dentist, with the radio dentist, Alan Sniffin.  Times I don't.  And this is one time I don't.  He's lambasting the show and our fans and, and I guess Nathaniel, who, who did this whole thing.  And saying that, uh, we shouldn't be doing this.  This is horrible.  Uh, we cost the man his job.  This is stuff, this type of thing, they make, well, you watch that America's Funniest Home video shows and things like that. 
[00:41:00]  They make whole segments based on people behind reporters when they're doing a live shot.  When they're out there doing their live shot, they put themselves on the street and they're dealing with the public.  And these things happen.  It happens to them all the time.  And it will continue to happen.  It will continue to happen.  It will continue to happen.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And because some guy stands there, Nathaniel is there with a sign, and some nut comes up on side of him and, and actually puts a gesture in the camera, which, by the way, the reporter never saw. 
[00:41:30]  He just saw some kind of discrepancy behind him, some kind of, a disturbance behind him.  You know who that was?  You haven't heard yet?  Oh, no, I haven't heard.  Oh, okay.  Yes, I have.  It was Crazy Cabby from Howard Stern Show.  Everyone's favorite felon.  Everyone's favorite taxi vader.  Who, by the way, every time he sees Anthony and I on the streets of New York, kisses our ass and talks to us forever.  Unbelievable.  Comes up, hey, dudes, how you doing, man?  Show's going great.  And then he gets up there, and apparently he said, when Nathaniel said, ONA, XM Satellite Radio, he said, sucks. 
[00:42:00]  But it sounded like rocks.  I defy anybody watching that clip to see that he is not a fan of the show, that he was trying to actually show that ONA suck.  Right.  Because he comes off like just a super fan behind the camera, in front of the camera, behind the reporter.  Unbelievable.  It was stupid, crazy cabby.  Yeah, I think he's apparently trying to give the sign the finger, but it doesn't really work. 
[00:42:30]  No, he wasn't.  He was just, he wasn't.  I saw, I heard that from you, because that was his explanation, and I watched the clip.  He know he wasn't.  He was just trying to be a part of the shot before he goes off to jail and gets railed in the ass for not paying your taxes.  Pay your taxes, stupid.  It's not trying to be funny on film.  You're funny in the accountant's office when you're writing a check to the federal government.  Idiot.  Now, if he really hates the show and wanted to give the finger to the sign, as he said, he should have grabbed the sign out of your hand. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And smashed it over his knee and go, F these guys, or something.  Or just taking the sign and smash it over Nathaniel's head.  Right.  Nice little wrestling move.  Which, by the way, would have been hysterical.  Oh my God, I would have laughed my ass off.  Would have been hysterical.  Nathaniel's head goes through the sign.  That's what a real man would have done.  If he was supposedly against the show, please.  Instead, he politely let me put it in front of his face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Put it in front of his face. 
[00:43:30]  By the way, Anthony, I just want to bow to Nathaniel today.  Wow.  How do you bow?  You're bowing.  Jeez.  See what he gave us, like, massive...  Oh, like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Thank you very much.  All right.  There you go.  Huh?  Good bow.  This guy gave us, like, massive, massive publicity.  A lot of press.  This little intern that I finally know his name.  It's Nathaniel, everybody.  That's right.  Danny's assault on media looking a little thin compared to Nathaniel.  You better paint ONA on an axe and bury it in someone's head on the throne, stupid. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, to the faithful listeners, they know what happened.  Like, earlier in the week, last week, Danny came up with a great assault on the media.  He had a cigarette in one hand, a coffee in another, and still was able to hold the sign right back in the reporter's head.  And that reporter didn't lose his composure.  No.  And then, you know, you fast-forward just a mere three days.  We were talking about Danny all week.  Oh, it was great.  And Nathaniel did what he did.  And thank God Nathaniel did a perfect assault on the media, by the way. 
[00:44:30]  That's the only reason we're not in trouble in Washington.  No cursing.  We did nothing wrong.  We just stood there with a sign, and he said, you know, we rock, or whatever he said.  And this is why the Alan Sniffen radio message board there, why he's got it totally wrong.  Of course.  If one of our guys had walked up to the reporter, touched him in any way, started cursing behind him,  did something that interfered with his actual report, then there would have been a problem. 
[00:45:00]  And then you could actually see Alan's point.  His point was that people should not do this kind of thing.  We got him fired.  If we weren't there, it never would have happened.  He never would have said that and would have still had his job.  I really didn't even understand what kind of point he was trying to make,  because this happens to reporters all the time.  People get behind the shot.  Sometimes it's just nothing.  It's a crowd of people waving, and the reporter doesn't even know it. 
[00:45:30]  And sometimes it's people, you know, coming up and yelling things to try to get a point across,  political things, saying hi to their friends, anything.  Nathaniel, yes.  People kept making the point, oh, what if somebody came into your workplace and started yelling?  They do.  Yeah, but...  When we're out.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  He's in a public spot.  It's not like I burst into CBS studios and was like, you know, start taking over their newscast.  Ah, which is next week.  Yes.  That's right.  Doing that.  We're going to take this to a whole new level.  When we're out on the streets and things like that, yeah, there are people that screw with us. 
[00:46:00]  When we do our live shows and we put ourselves in the position where we're in the public,  we don't know what the hell's going to happen.  And there have been segments that are just completely ruined by the animals that come to see us when we're doing live shows.  So, yeah, it does happen.  And it has happened.  When you guys got booted, I'm sorry to say, I didn't want to see this guy get fired either.  He does seem like a real dude show to turn around like that.  But you know what?  Too bad when you guys got booted, there was not one person in the media stepping up to go.  I mean, even though what you did was definitely much more serious. 
[00:46:30]  But the way they got the facts wrong and Paul was a producer, all these things they got wrong,  they didn't even bother to give a shit and get the facts right.  So I have very little mercy for anybody in that position.  I felt the same way on a personal level.  Like because this guy is a human being and he lost his job, I feel bad about that.  But when you take it on the whole as here's one of the media, one of the guys that were just, you know, crucifying us when we got the boot,  and like Jimmy said, getting everything wrong, it's almost a little bit of justice. 
[00:47:00]  But, yeah, on a personal level, I don't want to see the guy get fired.  No, not at all.  I mean, the guy just lost his composure.  You can't lose your composure in the number one market like that.  You can't, there wasn't even a, he didn't even wait a few seconds.  And there was absolutely nothing for that guy to lose his composure over.  Right.  Nothing.  I think what happened was he was looking at the monitor, because I've seen these live shots  and the reporters usually look at the monitor to take a look at the shots, see if they look good, whatever.  And I'm sure while he was doing the report, he was looking at the monitor going, 
[00:47:30]  oh my God, look what's happening behind me, and he was just losing his mind.  Do your MetroCard story and go to the tape and shut up.  Exactly.  This wasn't exactly 9-11 coverage, it was some homeless guy.  That's a big story.  The homeless people use the MetroCard to let people through?  Yeah.  Wow, stop the presses.  Be careful on your way to work, folks.  The homeless guy may be scamming.  Who doesn't know that shit?  Oh, by the way, newsflash, guys, just be careful.  Homeless people also smell.  I don't know if you guys heard that.  And they shit outdoors.  I hope I'm not, like, scooping 60 minutes this Sunday. 
[00:48:00]  Here's the audio.  I mean, the video has been downloaded, I don't know.  I don't know what it's up to, like 150,000 times or something like that, from all over  the world.  All over the world.  The clip went everywhere.  And then the press clippings are from almost every city in America.  And then it went to China, and Current Affair did something on it, and CNN Headline News.  Our good friend Imus talked about it.  Stupid Booker on KROQ talked about it.  Yeah, it was downloaded 120,000 times.  120,000 times?  And Danny's got a cute 9,000 last week. 
[00:48:30]  I thought that was nice.  Who else?  The other intern?  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm sure only...  They're counting their assaults on the media.  And I'm sure only 90% of those were people actually looking for my assault on the media.  What's this wet stuff on my bagel?  I don't know.  Did you spit on this?  Why would I be spitting on...  Oh.  Maybe Ricky had an itch under his arm and then touched a bit.  Ricky, what is this?  What is this?  The boss wants to know what the wet stuff is, Rick.  What is this? 
[00:49:00]  It might have been the eggs.  There was...  Oh, God.  No!  It might have been eggs?  Yeah, the eggs can have been...  I want a toasted bagel, not an egg juice on it.  Let me get you another one.  Fuck!  Do I want you to get me another one?  No.  No, actually.  Where's Travis?  Travis, could you please get me one?  God, there's always a problem.  Away with you!  Away!  Away!  Leave!  Leave the fucking studio!  I'm sick of you!  I'm sick of you!  You're incompetent! 
[00:49:30]  You're completely incompetent!  I can't stand you!  Hi, Kenny.  Here comes Kenny to save the day!  Travis, thank you, sir.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny, you big and stupid!  Six foot five killer, he's hit!  Alright, relax.  Kenny's here.  Thank you, Kenny.  You want me to get it?  Here comes Club Soda Kenny!  Thank you!  Hey, Travis, give me some eggs, too, in that.  I'm kidding.  He would probably keep it separate enough where nothing would happen.  Of course he would.  I can't take it.  It's every fucking day.  It's every day. 
[00:50:00]  It's now official.  Anthony has lost his mind.  I can take it.  That's it.  I lost it a while ago with him.  Jimmy lost it.  And now, finally, it's official.  My whole thing?  I could go months.  I love how he goes, well, it might be.  You don't hand Anthony any type of food primes and go, well, that could be botulism.  That could be, oh, I'll eat it anyway.  Right.  Could be spit.  Could be anything.  What he should have said was, I have no idea.  That must have been something that they did when they were there.  I did nothing.  It's wrapped.  Oh.  I had to teach that kid how to lie.  It could be. 
[00:50:30]  I started cringing as soon as he said that.  It could be.  It could be this.  He is never, ever to get food again.  Already, Jimmy, already, you said that, right?  Like, you don't want him getting anything.  Actually, October 8th.  You were just being a nice guy, Anthony.  He's completely failed the test on the food for months and months and months.  And took us out of the game again.  Holy Jesus.  We're in the middle of talking about this assault on the media, and now we have to talk about  Ricky again.  It could be.  It could be.  It's his little plan scene.  Nathaniel was getting a lot of air time here. 
[00:51:00]  I had a good line about Danny, you know, not getting so many downloads.  Exactly.  That was very funny.  Everybody was ready to laugh.  What was the line?  Well, I was saying.  You know, he had so few downloads, and probably only 90% of those were people actually looking  for my video.  See?  Still works.  I love it.  And it's true.  Even though he did get some downloads, probably just mistakes.  But don't give...  I don't like the way you keep using the name.  I don't reckon just the other person.  The other guy?  Yeah.  It's just a perfect example of how marketing works, though.  I mean, we do these assaults on the media all the time, and we encourage you guys to 
[00:51:30]  continue doing the assaults on the media, by the way, because that was a whole discussion.  Will this end the assaults on the media?  Will they be told to stop doing that?  Of course not.  Ah.  Especially if you do it like Nathaniel does it.  Classy.  Classy and perfectly.  Right.  But it's a good way to show you how marketing works.  You know, Danny did pretty much the exact assault on the media, but his reporter didn't lose  his mind.  Gotta get the reporters to lose their mind.  The reporter loses his mind, and now it's a story all over the country with everybody checking 
[00:52:00]  out the show, checking out the video, writing about us on message boards all over the place.  And they will continue, because it is a very good way to promote the program.  It's legal.  It's harmless.  And it's completely legal and harmless.  Do your job right.  Sorry.  You don't know why.  Let's be honest.  That was ego.  The reporter's ego, like you pointed out with Newsweek, they like to have the real of  all their stories.  His ego is affected because he was being a little bit irritated by some pest.  Pest.  And you know what, that's a real statement about that guy. 
[00:52:30]  You don't just turn around and go, what the fuck is your problem, man, like over something  like that.  You don't do it, unless that's who you are.  Right.  Well, the video's still up on opianthony.com, but here's the audio just to get everyone up  to speed again.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously  swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit, but  it's costing the TA a great deal, about sixteen million dollars a year, and they're trying 
[00:53:00]  to put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  They're trying to put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Sorry about that distraction before.  The Transit Committee is expected to have passed this later on today.  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  Sorry.  Ask Asa.  Hey, Asa, where's the unemployment line? 
[00:53:30]  Come on, you.  Wow, he didn't even, like, stop.  No, there wasn't.  See, I mean, I feel bad the guy lost his job, but he didn't even, like, think.  He blew his cool.  John in New York on the phone making a very valid point also.  All right, let's go to John in New York.  Hey, yeah.  How you guys doing?  Hi, John.  I just want to say it's obvious that reporters are never intrusive into other people's lives.  There you go.  There's another thing.  A couple of guys behind the reporter, maybe getting on his nerves a little bit. 
[00:54:00]  He loses his cool and starts cursing.  These reporters are constantly screwing with people.  Constantly getting in their face and on their jobs.  You're right.  How many times do you see them go to their jobs, shove that camera in, and try?  On purpose, they try to get a response like this from these people.  You're right.  They would love for the person to lose their cool and say, fuck, so they can bleep it out  and show what an asshole, nasty guy this guy is. 
[00:54:30]  Maybe somebody's got to go jump out his window, climb down some bed sheets in order to get away from the cameras, huh?  There you go.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thanks, John.  All right.  So that's a great point.  We made the newspapers all over America.  I haven't even read these yet, the Daily News and the Post, Anthony.  We're a little behind the times, and then we've got some audio to get to.  The story just gets more and more interesting.  Basically, I'm trying to figure, I think this was from the Post, New York Post from Friday. 
[00:55:00]  News Channel 2 can't afford a Ford.  What are they getting at?  The A-F-Ford.  Ford.  A-F-Ford.  Oh, it's News Channel 2 can't A-F-Ford.  A fucking Ford?  Yeah, the F word.  They're trying to get really clever with the headline, and I don't really get it.  It's A-F-F-F-O-R-D.  A Ford.  Or F-Word, so they're like, F-Word, but then said F-Ford. 
[00:55:30]  F-Ford.  Oof.  That's a stretch.  Anyway, Channel 2 reporter Arthur Chen was fired yesterday after he used F-Word on air during  a 6 a.m. broadcast.  Chen was standing in front of a subway station delivering a live intro to a segment about  a MetroCard scam when two men walked up behind him, held up a sign, and began chanting  Opie and Anthony.  Once again, wrong, by the way.  Wrong.  Of course.  Wrong.  It was Nathaniel, and then it was Cabby there.  The video was available to anybody who actually wanted to see the event. 
[00:56:00]  You would think a news person might want to see the event.  Yeah, wrong again.  Wrong again.  Held up a sign, began chanting Opie and Anthony.  The names of the XM satellite radio, shock jocks, shock jocks, shocking, shocking, shock  jocks.  We are so shocking.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.  Uh, Chen thinking he'd finished the live part of the report.  Another.  Uh-huh. 
[00:56:30]  That's wrong, too.  He knew he was still live.  He just lost his mind.  Yeah.  You could hear it in the clip.  He didn't even, he didn't even pause after he was done.  Barely got that last word of his report out.  Uh, Chen thinking he'd finished the live part of the report, whirled around and blurted  out to the interlopers.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Man.  By the way, by the way, later on the show today, pick up your, what the fuck is your  problem, man, t-shirt.  Do we know how to exploit, or do we know how to exploit? 
[00:57:00]  People are lining up outside the station right now.  That's right.  To pick up their, what the fuck is your problem, man, t-shirts.  You know what's just, man.  Yes, go ahead, Jimmy.  You know what's very interesting?  If the one time some idiot reporter loses his cool is when his story, you never hear a  guy reporting a rape or a child murder going, what the fuck is wrong with people?  They can handle it then, but God forbid somebody's interfering with his dog shit story and he 
[00:57:30]  loses his mind.  And God forbid he had some honesty as a human being and go, I'm doing a live report, could  you idiots stop this?  Right.  Could they for once address it like human beings?  Hey, you jackass.  Yeah.  It's just a bunch of fun.  We say almost every day in the show now, one of Howard Stern's cronies was involved in  this and that, that big fucking old lady pussy shut up and didn't say a word about it.  No?  Didn't say a word about Fry, didn't say a word about it on Monday.  It's one of his guys was involved in a pretty huge radio story and he, he just kept his mouth 
[00:58:00]  shut.  Because it wasn't me.  Oh, Alan Sniffen didn't like it.  Alan.  It's Alan Sniffen.  Very disappointed in his take on the whole thing.  Yeah, it's like stop being a baby, dude.  Stop it.  Ah, it's all something meatier.  Not good.  Shut up.  They're fucking great.  Anyway, continuing here.  Cool.  And they will continue.  Oh, by the way, Pat.  People with your live shots out there, this will not stop.  You can bet that's not going to happen. 
[00:58:30]  You know how much they're freaking out right now?  We're going to send them right back on top of their trucks again.  Dude, because they, you know, oh, wait a minute.  Who's this?  Pat?  Hey.  What's up?  Nothing much.  Oh, Pat from Menaki.  What's up, Pat?  No, Pat from Menaki's out here right now.  Oh, okay.  We're planning to hold Travis hostage if the animals are not let upstairs.  There will be no blackmail.  Travis has to get up with my bagel.  Go fuck yourself.  We have nine animals and one golfer, and we want to be upstairs. 
[00:59:00]  They're holding Pat hostage until we let the animals upstairs to check out the show.  They're slowly but surely coming to the station to pick up their what the fuck is your problem,  man, t-shirts, which I think will happen around 9 o'clock today.  Anyway, now that this video has made it all over the country, Anthony, and been reported  on CNN headline news and stuff, it's only going to make these animals want to do this more.  Now you're going to see a lot more assaults on the media. 
[00:59:30]  You watch.  Of course you will.  Everyone's going to want to.  They love to please us, Sophie.  Unfortunately for Chen, the camera was still rolling, and the expletive rang out loud and  clear over the airwaves.  I can confirm that he has been terminated.  A Channel 2 spokeswoman told Page Six, we have no further comment regarding his termination.  The network-owned station also issued this statement.  Oh, boy.  Here's the statement.  Uh-oh.  WCBS-TV apologizes for the use of inappropriate language today during our 6 a.m. broadcast.  We deeply regret the incident. 
[01:00:00]  Sincere, at least.  Yeah.  They're bags.  Did you read the AP story?  No.  This one was the best.  I read the last line.  It's just classic.  It tells the story.  Same story.  Subway station.  Blah, blah, blah.  Right, right.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  The F word went out of the air.  Channel 2 fired Chen yesterday.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wait, wait, wait.  I didn't get a shock out of you.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  As for the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  They're celebrating over the reporter's firing.  how did this yeah whoever did the ap report here whoever wrote this and this went all over the  place first of all we left the show thursday before the guy was fired right before we knew 
[01:01:00]  anything about this firing we left we went our own ways anthony went not been on the air since  now right anthony went to colorado i went to florida we'll get into that stuff a little later  we weren't celebrating how did this lying sack of shit that wrote this story  how do you assume we were celebrating over the guys firing how are they just allowed to print  that this is uh the ap what the fuck is his problem man man man man what the they're celebrating over 
[01:01:30]  you know we're celebrating we're celebrating the fact that uh we got some press i like that  but as far as celebrating the guys firing no one got a statement from any of us so how now how does  this guy go and say that uh we're celebrating over the report is firing these may they're making it  really easy for me to not give a shit that the guy got fired these reporters because they're all from  the same mold every single one of these jerk offs yep from the same mold they're phonies liars 
[01:02:00]  this guy is just he's an ap the guy the story's picked up by the ap associated press and it's  bullshit i read this in colorado i read it oh really i'm celebrating the fact that the guy was fired  do we find out who wrote it it's not a secret there's got to be a way for someone on this show to find  that out seriously who wrote this i think they hide behind that little ap thing yeah i would love to 
[01:02:30]  find out and then they do this all the time i mean this is just a dumb shock jock story but but they do  this with with really serious news yeah where they just make up their shit yeah they just they made up  that line yep and whatever is it gonna affect our lives no it's probably gonna make us even bigger  whatever but then you gotta wonder what other ap stories out there are they just making up facts to  make the story that much more interesting they make it up like where where did he get that we're  celebrating over the reporter's fire no one talked to me i went to hiding for four days my nephew was 
[01:03:00]  graduating from high school decided to go down there and and support him and no one really got a hold of  me no i didn't talk to anybody they didn't see me celebrating although they were trying to get a camera  crew down to uh florida current affair was a current affair they wanted news they want to interview me at my  uh nephew's graduation from high school they had a poll i hear yeah we got all that oh you do oh  yeah we've just begun with this story it's just taken on a life of its own all right getting to the 
[01:03:30]  daily news story let's see what's wrong in this one f word cost tv guy a job tv reporter arthur chen  was canned by uh cbs too yesterday after he shouted the f word at two meddlers  oh you meddling kids stop meddling isn't that like an old scooby-doo line you meddling kid what  was the line from scooby-doo and i would have gotten away with it too oh yeah that wasn't for  you meddling kids that's right okay at two meddlers who horned in on his live shot ken was in the middle 
[01:04:00]  of a 6 a.m broadcast about metro card scammers when two men sneaked up behind him with a sign  promoting radio shock jocks opie and anthony shock jocks for a few moments as the knuckleheads  hey nathaniel you're a knucklehead you knucklehead i don't appreciate that knucklehead one and danny  unfortunately is now knucklehead two you mean intern b meddlers and knuckleheads all of them 
[01:04:30]  you see look at one reporter editorializing for the other reporter isn't that kind of nice how  protective they get oh yeah for each other let's get to it here uh for a few moments as the knuckleheads  heckled him and gave the finger to the camera chen kept his cool and continued talking but as soon as  he finished his report he spun around and shouted at the intruders what the fuck is your problem man  once again don't forget to pick up your what's what the fuck is your problem man t-shirts 
[01:05:00]  later this morning outside right people the opie and anthony broadcast center people lining up as  we speak that's why club soda kenny is here by the way they're gonna be collector's items uh if he  thought the cbs control room had already uh if he thought the cbs control room had already cut the  tape he was wrong now he knew they didn't cut cut the tape he didn't even wait the expletive went out  over the air sorry about that distraction before chen said when he returned that's not for what did he 
[01:05:30]  say bofo bobo bobo bobo for the apology apparently wasn't enough for cbs especially when the fcc is  cracking down on obscenity he's been terminated station spokeswoman audrey pass said chen a former  new york one reporter who joined cbs in 2003 told the daily news he's sorry power i regret the entire  thing and i apologize to those who were offended he said meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile fans of the  opie anthony show who have mounted a campaign to annoy television reporters were boasting about the  infantile stunt on the dj's website the campaign isn't to annoy reporters it's to get the name opie 
[01:06:00]  anthony xm satellite radio on uh television without having to pay for it because um they don't really  give us money for that here but so that's the best thing do you see how incestuous they are in their  writing man do you see how incestuous it is uh the meddlers which they are and uh you know knuckleheads  which they are and you know uh uh infantile stunt which it was but then they say uh uh chen kept his 
[01:06:30]  cool and continued talking it's almost like but they say that like you know while it was happening he was  keeping his cool they cannot help but go to bat the guy who fucked up sorry he fucked up yeah nathaniel did  nothing wrong he stood there with a sign like a million other people have done and old potty mouth  couldn't take it and if you don't stop it i may file a complaint against cbs because i was offended  when this show played that 85 times the potty mouth pair have a show on xm satellite radio they have 
[01:07:00]  to end this article with this where they landed after being bounced by new for a contest that enticed  two listeners that listeners to have sex in saint pat's cathedral oh yeah so that's only that's that's  the new york uh coverage but it went everywhere the ap story and what have you you're not the potty  mouth pair what kind of profanity did you use on national television potty mouth yeah you didn't curse  tom on long island what's up tom yeah i just want to say real quick i think the biggest story

[01:09:30]  the deal i go you know what it's weird they're really really excited down in washington they think  it was perfect they think the execution was perfect it was absolutely and they supported us they  said you know you guys will have no problems with this don't even worry about it enjoy your  couple days off enjoy your long weekend i'm like all right great thanks what the boston herald wrote  no the herald had a piece on friday because the guy was an ex-boston uh news guy okay uh it said 
[01:10:00]  opie and anthony claim another victim the manatees wrote about it in their column the inside track  yeah what claim another victim what victims have we claimed in the past ourselves a couple of times  psycho mark there's been a few here and there got fired yeah we we'd leave some wreckage oh wait a  minute yeah start the start stevens well start jeremy jeremy rick yeah well okay all right accurate 
[01:10:30]  recording then from uh the heralds another one in our wake here is uh what alan sniffon had to say  anthony on this new york radio message um alan sniffon yes i have defended ona on this forum  frequently but some of their fans are idiots and ona are idiots for encouraging them below linked is a  story from the daily news which basically tells how two of ona's lame-brained fans why you lame 
[01:11:00]  brains lame-brained fans disrupted a tv correspondent we gotta keep a list of these words i got lame-brained  knucklehead medallers medallers intruders intruders intruders interlopers interlopers interlopers cronies  they say cronies they were cronies yeah so in these cronies nice yeah they're a bunch of boss words  yeah these old 40s words what's with no cronies meant crony uh let's see ona's lame-brained fans  disrupted a tv correspondent's live report which ultimately resulted in the reporter using an 
[01:11:30]  obscenity should the reporter have known better yes but the guy lost his job because he was put in  a position that i'm willing to bet most any of us would have responded to in the same way  wrong alan you're wrong you're wrong alan's wrong alan sniffon wrong most of us would have responded in  the same way maybe if you're walking down the street and someone's following you with a sign 
[01:12:00]  and won't go away but if you're a reporter in new york city you know better and you know this happens  and you've probably had it happen to you before you just deal with it you're out in public things are  going to happen what does he mean most people how would how would he know who's ever held a sign up  to him that would annoy that someone across the street hold up a sign cheaper fillings here  when he's trying to do his uh his a recorded portion of his message board uh presentation 
[01:12:30]  well he'll talk about this the next time he does his recording yeah basically yeah  board reflection make sure we get a copy of board reflections when he talks about this  i'm gonna talk today about opie and anthony right uh and these are moron interloper cronies  holding up signs i can't wait to hear that it's a perfect name because that's how you feel when  you hear it uh so now he's out of work because these two morons interfered with his broadcast 
[01:13:00]  and these two morons were encouraged indirectly by ona now let me uh correct you they were encouraged  directly from ona we encourage this directly we don't want them touching the reporter hurting them  or anything uh we want the sign with our name on it behind them in the shot that's it if they're out  on the street we're going to be looking for the live shot and it's going to keep happening this 
[01:13:30]  doesn't mean that every time it happens someone's going to lose their job does it no you don't lose  your cool like this we've done this uh dozens of times at this point and this is the first guy that  loss is cool it's one thing to make fun of a situation and or people that take things too  seriously which is i guess the news guys i get it with that and ona are frequently good at it  but a prank that results in the victim losing his job is just plain going too far this isn't a prank  that results in the victim losing his job it isn't because you could do this a thousand times and no 
[01:14:00]  one's going to lose their job over it this is a a promotion that we do that resulted in the guy  losing his job because he made the mistake not us we didn't error going out there with a sign and  holding it up behind the shot this guy made a mistake that's it  while ona didn't specifically stand behind this guy and wave a sign they have consistently 
[01:14:30]  encouraged this kind of behavior from their idiotic fans who think this makes for gooder radio he  puts in quotes it's more gooder it's more gooder you more gooder radio and it does make for more  gooder radio it's not funny this has given us a lot of fodder today just ask arthur chien who is now  looking for a job because he responded to the two knuckle-dragging idiots  bless you bless you thank you that's what was on your bagel before 
[01:15:00]  no i threw it away uh just ask arthur chien who's now looking for a job knuckle-dragging idiots who  gave their permission to act like jerks by a radio show yeah i know it's publicity publicity at  someone else's expense his livelihood again wrong  we're not doing something that is going to result in someone's firing  it absolutely isn't we are not doing something that is going to if we go out today and do it again 
[01:15:30]  does it mean this guy's going to get fired no the guy made a mistake that's it  he made the mistake he lost his cool cursed and got himself thrown off the air  alan's totally wrong on this one da da da da da all right then uh we got some audio  it made a lot of local uh local news but basically we got some of the more interesting ones here i 
[01:16:00]  guess here's cnn uh headline news a reporter for wcbs tv in new york has been fired for swearing during  a broadcast arthur chien was doing a report on illegal subway car doctrine when he was heckled  by two passersby he managed to stay composed during his live shot but then the microphone caught him  yelling an obscenity afterward the chien has since apologized the hecklers were holding up a sign for  the opie and anthony's satellite radio show yeah we're real stupid alan cnn headline news is saying  our names but we're dumb and i didn't heckle anybody it's not like i was like hey arthur nice 
[01:16:30]  reporting you know yeah that's heckling you know if you would have been hey arthur come on what the  hell you stink there's an awful story you suck be more funny yeah we're just a bunch of dummies we  don't know how to get our names out there we're stupid eric from jersey what's up yeah i'm just  listening to this and it's the same thing you hear it all the time if a little league umpire makes a bad  call the parent goes and beats up the umpire is it the umpire's call that caused the uh beating 
[01:17:00]  no it's the parent losing their cool yep oh i like that i like that analogy so we should start  beating the reporters i think so yeah what is he saying well you get the point all right thanks  eric okay i don't know what this means jared in jersey what's up jared hey what's going on guys  hey how you doing hi fella uh i just find it really amusing that all these reporters are bashing you  guys for you know getting married with the sign in front of this guy's uh shot but at the same time  if you ever notice when they go live to like a protest or some event or something say you're 
[01:17:30]  watching like fox news they will always get cnn signed and they're like cnn sucks they'll make  sure it's in the shot while they're broadcasting live on fox or something like that it's just  ridiculous a lot of stories these guys do are in front of crowds that are yelling things  and uh they keep their cool uh danny from bowling green kentucky saying the reporter made two  mistakes the first one was broadcasting right outside of the ona studio any subway stop in the  city and he picks that one yeah he picks the one that is closest to us right here not even a block 
[01:18:00]  away ouch all right and then we have uh a current affair anthony a current affair is back and the host  of the show just stinks he is the worst he is awful this show will go nowhere without it doesn't have  the charm of the old car not at all it is awful i i think i think he knows it's just horrendous  but they did a little piece let's get a little business out of the way first that's the guy listen 
[01:18:30]  how this is the guy that replaced maury povich listen to his delivery let's get a little business  out of the way first this is a tape of a local new york cbs news reporter arthur chien doing a live to  air stand-up in manhattan now two geniuses come up behind him they're making noise and waving a sign  promoting two other rocket scientists and making his job tough so what does he do and they're trying  to put a stop to it what the f is your problem man exactly what a lot of new yorkers might do under  that kind of stress hopefully i wouldn't but he finishes not on camera you fucking asshole oh i just 
[01:19:00]  did it see language man use the f word what we're not rocket scientists are we why do people keep  confusing us with rocket scientists all the time i know a little bit about rocketry i used to fly  sd's model rockets as a kid but why do so many people get our jobs here on radio confused with some  sort of rocket science all the time i think i know because at times when you watch them on tv 
[01:19:30]  you're over here going vroom vroom maybe that's it they're a bunch of phonies too because they were  this rocket science oh wow that's a new one it makes sense that your interns are geniuses like he  said yes right because we're rocket scientists we would need geniuses around us to to help us out  with our rocket science let's go to frank in virginia frank hey what's up guys hey uh i played  tommy or rumble uh on the morning show uh on the morning show when you guys had us calling in okay  and then uh yesterday they were talking about you guys they're trying to get their fans now to do the 
[01:20:00]  uh assault on the media but they were uh you know talking about you guys have you know going around  america having uh people call in to make your you know basically make your show better by playing  their show and uh these two guys are these two guys are basically like don and mike except they don't  kill puppies and have their awful wife call up there's a lot of donna mike hacks out there trust  me a lot of donna mike hacks thanks frank i'm gonna start off with this current affair thing 
[01:20:30]  let's get a little business out of the way first this is a tape of a local new york cbs news reporter  arthur chien doing a live to air stand-up in manhattan now two geniuses come up behind him they're making  noise and waving a sign promoting two other rocket scientists and making his job tough so what is he  do and they're trying to put a stop to it what the is your problem man exactly what a lot of new  yorkers might do under that kind of stress hopefully i wouldn't but he finishes his stand-up turns over 
[01:21:00]  and says what the f word is your problem man okay so it's a big no no to say the f word on tv we all  know that but this guy didn't say it for effect he wasn't doing a howard stern or trying to shock  anyone he was being badgered by two morons so what does cbs do they fire him the sack cut off his  career basically over because they timidly and wrongly believe the federal communication  commission will censor or find them well here's some breaking news fellas the fcc told us today 
[01:21:30]  they did not get one complaint there you go why didn't the parents television council complain  about that they complain about innuendo of bosom is around and here old potty mouth chien there it is  the big one the f word the number two bad word to ever have on television that's right let's go to  mike in cleveland mike hey opie yeah can you can you just say none on us we're artists none on us how  much responsibility do we have for him getting fired opie i think norton's just ticked because 
[01:22:00]  no one's going around yelling jimmy norton party rock there you have it i'm not ticked sir thanks mike  actually that that was an anthony quote none on us right yeah none on us so then i guess the current  affair aired another piece on this um yesterday but we're we're stupid we're stupid to get our  names out there of course we are it's ob and anthony i can't wait to hear that uh so they did another  something on this yesterday i think they had a poll or something yeah welcome back to a current affair 
[01:22:30]  now on friday we had a phone and website poll asking whether you thought cbs should have fired  local new york reporter arthur chien for accidentally muttering the f word live on air when two morons  interrupted him from behind here's what you said of the 89 940 of you who voted 77 said no cbs should  not have fired arthur and 23 said yes arthur deserved to get the boot where is the love what 
[01:23:00]  yeah he's got charisma i'll say that oh full of spunk oh all right then we're trying to get  something through some of this we could be playing audio clips about this all morning you know that  was interesting he did a report on the reporter did this asshole go back and redo it you're not live  stupid reporter it's tim green he's apt i mean you got to watch a current affair to see how just stiff  this guy is to begin with and you know a current affair was a huge huge show back in the day you think  they would have found a guy with a little more charisma to be able to pull this this new version 
[01:23:30]  off an affair started the whole tabloid journalism this guy is the worst and he won't last i'm telling  you he stinks phil o'reilly used to uh post current affair also that's right after maury left here's  our good pal imus i haven't heard this yet i have no idea what he said about this a cbs news reporter  arthur chien was fired yesterday he used the f word on the air during the 6 a.m broadcast  what would have brought the difference to that he was standing in front of a subway station delivering 
[01:24:00]  a live intro um to the segment about metro card scams and two guys walk up behind him and hold up a  sign and began chanting uh chanting opi and anthony and so he he thought he'd finished the live report  according to page six he whirled around and blurted out to the interlopers what the blank is your  problem man he did he did and he's on tv it's time it was rolling according to page six it ran loud and 
[01:24:30]  clear over the end quote is this something that opi and anthony put him out there the uh the page six  report does not say that one can only hope that the guy made a mistake take it easy yeah we will  automatically a curbside execution of old poor author chance that's one mistake nuclear option  what the heck is wrong with wcbs take it easy yeah calm down all right see everyone obviously the guy 
[01:25:00]  should not have been fired the people that look most ridiculous in this situation is cbs cbs news  they fire the guy by the way uh this is reminding me of a few other assaults on the media and what  is i miss broadcasting from the shuttle yeah we got the hell what the hell was that clip there maybe  tranquility base uh the uh the uh shut up jerk the uh eagle has landed yeah would they fire him 
[01:25:30]  what what you get out on the moon i'm not going out on there i got i can't fit the space helmet on my  big uh cowboy hat how am i supposed to wear my cowboy hat when i'm wearing a a space helmet yeah the  fuck is your problem man oops what the hell was that clip i don't know man you can hear her fine and 
[01:26:00]  imus is somewhere uh somewhere about miles above the earth he's just bouncing around doing his show  don't forget to uh pick up some of my brother's salsa when you're uh here on mars  broadcasting from venus next week  oh too good all right now we got some audio from the todd schnitt is it schnitt or schmidt  his name alone because he's an fcc violation that's right goodness every day he's sweating just 
[01:26:30]  trying to get through his name without this is tom's shit i mean that's not even his name that's  probably a fancy showbiz name uh i'm schnitts all right well i had to change it from schnitzburg  when my family came here from poland from poland it was schnitz and bergenstein of it  uh where's this guy from out of tampa all right out of tampa anthony right let's take a listen here 
[01:27:00]  turns out these were a bunch of goons i don't know whether they were employees or they're just  uh you know unemployed uh opie and anthony listeners but uh opie and anthony the shock jock  radio show which used to be on the air in new york city until they got canned because remember opie  and anthony they were the uh i know he's going to go off in trashes and i swear no he sounds like 
[01:27:30]  he's gearing up for a compliment but these guys what amazes me is that these guys don't realize they're  playing into our hands they're just playing into our hands over and over again because this guy  thinks he's too cool for the room know how many people are going to go opie and anthony well a  i didn't know they were back on radio b they sound interesting i gotta get this xm now this is just  getting us more people to to join the program thank you why you play right into it every single time why 
[01:28:00]  are you trying i don't want to why are we trying to go head to head with tom schnitz can we just play  the audio without upsetting this guy anymore please i don't need tom schnitz coming after us  anthony they were the uh... imbeciles that had uh... two listeners have sex in saint patrick's  cathedral yeah that's class and it goes that goes just beyond uh... any even acceptable form of shock jock  radio yeah it was a shock jock radio a little shock little edgy this that doesn't bother me at all 
[01:28:30]  wow i'm having two listeners tough guy hey a little edginess hey i'm right there with you  i'm all for a little i'll have your back but i don't like the way by the way alan steven said that  uh... you know that's what anybody would do when they say well that's what happened in that church  i mean come on what are you doing you see a nice ass  anybody would have the same body  hey when i'm uh... you know a shock jockery a little shock jockery i'm right with you 
[01:29:00]  it's tom schnitz in tom schnitz in tom or todd what is it todd schnitz i am i swear to you  the schnitz i've never heard of this guy no one has we're playing right into his hands hoping you  should get larynx cancer  uh... you know  you might you might think that but uh... you know  i mean he's in a little market  yeah you know the the beauty of doing a national talk show and you start talking about the people  and they could  you know it's not like people in new york can go get the top schnitz show that's where 
[01:29:30]  schnitz  huh oh  i thought you cursed schnitz it's a good drinking beer  who is it  who is this is this schnitz or schnitzon schnitzon what's his name i would love to know how many people  in tampa signed up for xm just because they heard todd schnitz talking about this incident  schnitz jesus schnitz  i bet he has clever segments like hey in our bull schnitz section  we're gonna talk today about  i'm speaking of my last name on somebody's chest 
[01:30:00]  can you drop a schnitz on my chest jesus  you know he does something stupid like that  let's get back to you  you're full of me  having two listeners have sex in saint patrick's cathedral that's just over the top  and they were out of work for what a couple of years i think they were out for two years  then one of the satellite channels picked them up  and i guess they're they're on a mission or they have a mission for listeners 
[01:30:30]  to harass television live shots  apparently that's the deal  so there were two guys who are holding up this opium anthony radio sign behind this reporter the  guy's name arthur chien  and arthur was doing this report it was six a.m. it was like six oh one  and the anchor at wcbs channel two in new york goes to arthur chien  and uh... he's standing there he's doing his little uh... 
[01:31:00]  his rap so i guess he's opening up the story live then they're gonna throw it to a recorded  piece and then he'd come back and do the and that's it from here reporting live from some subway steps  i'm arthur chien channel two news or whatever the heck you would say but the guys behind him  were holding up the sign they're also like screaming the opium anthony they also flicked off  the camera right behind him 
[01:31:30]  he didn't even like wait like three seconds for them to cut to the package  he just whips around you know he ends his sentence live on the air and was that what  was that even a quarter of a second that he whips around and says what the bleep's your problem man  what the bleep's god fired  and don't forget you can get your what the fuck is your problem man t-shirts outside the  studio today listeners are lining up as we speak that's right sometime after nine o'clock uh...  we'll be handing out the t-shirts anthony yep that's why club soda kenny is here we're actually 
[01:32:00]  waiting for the fedex uh... man to deliver them are they're not here yet no that's why we had to wait  but there's uh... todd schnitt playing right into our hands sounded a lot like don from don and mike  yeah and a little tom likus in there too like this and a little lick ass in there  a real i like that realistic left and then  yeah yeah yeah if anybody wants to maybe make a couple of phone calls to a schnitt show and record  it let's get it let's those are always fun when the listeners do that yeah let's see if todd schnitzer 
[01:32:30]  let's see if todd schnitt could handle the ona army dugout dog  yeah  attack  oh i love you guys what a good birthday present let her rip kids i was gonna say uh... you know  he's talking about the thing uh... that all the fans do with the assault of the media i think we  should show them what serious questions really are i agree serious questions only people you guys have  no idea you'd never want our pests  and you know what really what is it three o'clock three p.m three p.m um let's see if he has the balls to 
[01:33:00]  take on our list is that the calling number yeah uh... one eight hundred eight oh one eight nine nine  right for those people now that have a pen it's one eight hundred eight oh one eight nine nine nine  and it's a week uh... weekdays three p.m to six p.m eastern uh... so serious questions only and uh... you  know i i wouldn't call up and try to use his wacky name in some part of your call and things 
[01:33:30]  like that is uh... mike is saying he's ultra conservative is that yeah well i also want to  go to hollywood real fast hollywood go ahead hey oh and hey hey hey listen i lived in champa and this  guy he's using his real name now but before he used to go by mj and bj his name was mj a couple  of weeks ago you guys were talking about uh... a guy that did wacky voices the crotchety old man  this is the guy that did the cd and he would always call up with that punchline oh thank god 
[01:34:00]  you answered bullshit oh yeah i yeah remember we we played one of those remember really it was  atrocious okay yeah this guy back in the day on flv 93 three back in tampa yeah they used to do a  morning show and then his sidekick went i think the cincinnati and left them out to dry and then i mean  this guy is just horrible so i mean the whole cd is just horrible so did he do like shock jock type  stuff they tried to see that they tried to be that's what's going on with this whole fcc thing 
[01:34:30]  a lot of these guys that did the shock radio are now making believe they never did it man cow's a  classic example now trying to claim that uh... his bosses made him do all the stuff he did in it back in  the day and they're trying to change their image because you know they have to survive in in the radio  climate that is now out there and here's another here's another phony make him believe he never  did any shocking radio before jack jack the uh... radio station he was on they did the uh...  morning show and then later on that evening was that uh... bubble love sponge so it was that jock jock 
[01:35:00]  type of uh... radio station hip-hop bullshit all right and now he's ultra conservative because  that's what all these guys are now doing they go from they go from shocking to now trying to be the  next rush limbaugh or sean hannity just i haven't heard his show in a while but i still think he  does his morning fm show and then he goes and does his uh he's got like a small little syndicated  throughout florida am show right so now guys well good luck to the schnitzer uh snap man from whack bag 
[01:35:30]  says he thinks before mj he called himself a schnitz buckley  that's good let's go to fort lee eric what's up good morning boys morning eric hey uh i i was  listening to k-rock on friday they they try to do their own spin on it i think kane was on the air 
[01:36:00]  and he said uh the reason why uh the guy cursed the reporter curses because cabbie was behind him  that he showed him the finger and that's why the reasons uh that the guy said you know what's your  problem well there's another interesting angle to this whole thing like we said you know crazy  they have it on camera they have cabbie on camera all right crazy cabbie which is uh one of howard  stern's cronies you know was involved in this because he was knucklehead because he was uh he was walking  by as uh nathaniel was doing this and howard doesn't even acknowledge it nah way to do real radio howard 
[01:36:30]  big huge uh radio story and and you just shut your little trap how can you take credit for  anything you did there there's nothing there that mentions any other radio station or program  you know or sorry it's just opie and anthony that's all you get from that video is opie and anthony  well it looks like obviously the press picked it up it looks like two fans walking up with a sign  it was really i mean one intern plus one fan yeah that's exactly what it was it is exactly how it is  i mean you know i mean cabbie's gonna make believe he's not a fan of this show please 
[01:37:00]  how many times did he kiss our ass outside of the building over there when we're going in for  meetings cabbie i don't think was talking no he's just uh cabbie's just trying to get into the subway  yeah and i think in fairness to cabbie he wasn't flipping the bird off the channel too he was flipping  the bird off to the radio show right to the sign he's just like whatever to these guys yeah he was  pointing it on the sun holy cabbie holy cabbie that's good stuff it's all over the internet if  you want to look for it it's pretty fun you know who is doing the show with him al dukes he used to 
[01:37:30]  kiss my ass on a daily basis that's al dukes yeah al dukes who's going to also make believe he's not  a fan of the opie anthony show are you insane and by the way do you notice the again once again the  incestuous tie-in let the viacom employees say that the other viacom employee was not giving the finger  to a viacom employee giving it to the sign yes well damn you sign did his wrists spin around so his 
[01:38:00]  fingernail was pointing at the sign or was it pointing at the camera well i don't know if you  know but they've dropped the fine because janet jackson was only showing her tit to justin timberlake  no one cares stupid it got out over the air it was his dirty viacom finger got a little more on this  arthur gianna channel 2 fired for dropping the up bomb i just want to know what was going through  his head like if he thought it was a a pre-taped thing i think he thought they immediately cut to  video that's al dukes he's good that's al dukes who used to kiss our ass on a daily basis actually 
[01:38:30]  bought me a pinball machine because he wanted to work for our show and i smashed it right in front of  his face we should get that video back up on opening anthony.com does he have his own show  now on kirok i guess they've teamed him up with booker or something i don't even know he's  producer but he's you know always jumps on jumping on for a little like al he's all right he stinks  he's a good radio a pre-taped thing i think he thought they immediately cut to video but they don't 
[01:39:00]  they hold you there forever he knows that he's done it a million times well why not just say what's your  problem yeah exactly but you know when you're just all hot like that you're trying to do your  job you're out there and it's tough i do this things in the street every now and again when i  used to do it for entertainment tonight it was the worst because if you do anything in the street  just forget about it all right all right this guy's got a comment i mean if you didn't see the  video yet i should recap it uh there was some guys with signs they were holding them up and cabbie of  course kind of bum rushed their thing with the middle finger flew the bird during arthur chien's broadcast 
[01:39:30]  then of course arthur chien's he didn't bum rush it no one's talking about a crazy cabbie from the  howard stern show we got to point that out it's hilarious bum rush the whole media is talking about  how opian anthony did this opian anthony opian anthony can't just be honest in your no one's honest  there honest out there here's a howard stern angle and then and howard chose not even to talk about it  a huge radio story dope arthur chien's broadcast then of course arthur chien curses at the end it's like 
[01:40:00]  a double whammy it's f bombs all over channel two it's it's just fantastic so uh so cabbie you can  see him in the video at his uh getaway his pseudo getaway he's like running down the subway stairs  this guy's got a theory on it yeah booker why are you so surprised on like cabbie's behavior good point  wait if he sees the camera if there's anything to do with media he's going to make himself sound like a  jackass and he doesn't even care what kind of publicity he's going to put out i just love that the  guy's going to jail and like he's still it hasn't changed his attitude the greatest thing is like 
[01:40:30]  i see the subway station it's right up the street so he was obviously coming off the air because sean  gables is on the air so it's got to be like 605 in the morning so he's just getting finished with the  shift right then and he would have to cross the street to get to this subway hole that he went down  into you know what i mean it's not the closest one to the radio station so you're right he did see what  was happening and he wanted to be involved so you're right and that's cabbie that's why i love 
[01:41:00]  him he's so funny and you wonder why he gets a two o'clock shift in the morning yeah well i still  think they should move that up all right take care buddy wow this is all edited that was 360  edited to shit because obviously they cut out any reference to opie and anthony right i'm sure the  caller i'm sure the caller was saying opie and anthony so you could hear where he has to edit it  because he's not allowed probably to say our names i'll listen for that on the replay what some  fucking fraudulent who is listening to that horrendous radio show that was that is god 
[01:41:30]  awful really boring yeah he's just crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah he's going to jail he said the same guy  hey nothing's changed nothing's changed maybe a big black cock in his ass will change him maybe then  he'll have a little more manners when he gets out i'll tell you what changed in fact he'll start paying  taxes pay up boy stop welching stop riding our backs i didn't like how they spun it so it's like 
[01:42:00]  almost as if i weren't there cabbie would have done that anyway because he's just so crazy because he's  crazy he's got crazy in his name and that showed divorce and that's so dishonest because anyone that  uh checked out the video or read the you know the newspaper articles on it the ap story i mean it had  nothing to do with him no one mentioned him why why aren't they talking about wacky fan it's all  crazy cabbie how about wacky fan oh that's good the wacky fan and crazy cabbie yeah and once again  howard stern showing that he is indeed just a pussy just a pussy showing him up again had nothing to 
[01:42:30]  say and one of his guys was quote involved he's just crazy right with the middle finger it bombs all  over the place yeah unlistenable well anthony i think uh nathaniel i think this is one of the top  three assaults on the media ever i believe three ever well let's let's think of some of the ones that  have uh been done and i think the videos are now up on opanthony.com the classic of course attack on 
[01:43:00]  the assault on the media when the uh the the a-bomb was dropped oh the c-word the c-word the video is  now back up on opanthony.com i haven't seen that in a while but basically word always beats f-word yeah  yep oh yeah someone uh well someone we know who who it was it was psycho mark held up uh yeah held  up the c-word on live tv big sign right behind uh melissa russo russo she was working for channel  four she's still there uh i've seen her from time to time but there's a sign behind her as she's doing 
[01:43:30]  a story from time square where the hell was it was uh eighth avenue and 47th street yeah on top of the  van and that was the time yeah the assaults on the media and back in the day got so out of control  out of control in new york especially that the reporters started doing their live shots from  on top of the news vans yeah they climbed up there with the camera and did it from there so the street  level people couldn't get behind the camera right uh but psycho mark got on someone's shoulders or  something like that someone's shoulders held up a big sign with the c-word written on it and just 
[01:44:00]  held it up behind it so as she's doing the story you're distracted by the c-word the atom bomb of all  curse words right behind her head so that video is up that's gonna get a lot of hits today and then also  there was the uh the today show flashing huge with the wow sticker way before janet jackson  your pals did it first the girl uh completely uh exposed on the today show as they're panning the  line in the morning with a with a huge uh open anthony well whatever a wow sticker on her chest 
[01:44:30]  well it was kind of like under her boobs uh yeah yeah because her boobs were not covered  no they were completely exposed yeah and remember howard tried to claim uh responsibility for that  i got to tie a bandana around a nude woman he was like that was that was awesome then all  sudden people had him whisper to howard uh howard uh the girl had a open anthony sticker on yeah  ah well it was still my guys that did that what oh yeah he tried to he tried to take responsibility  for that and now uh put in later and now nathaniel's uh nathaniel's uh thing is right up there now too 
[01:45:00]  oh yeah i'm glad to be among the greats also we got the video up of me smashing al dukes's stupid  pinball machine it's a classic i think danny's up there in the top 400 though that i mean that was a  pretty good one when he held that o and the a got on camera and the half of a caricature i'm like wow  oh jesus he did a great assault on the media if you have a letterbox television  wide screen idiot getting the shot we were very excited though i remember 
[01:45:30]  it was all about danny until nathaniel came to the plate just stole his thunder oh man did he  steal his thunder can can i see the hits on the two uh assaults on the media by the uh the interns  let's start with danny how many hits have has danny's assault on the media gotten oh my god you  can't even find it anymore in the list of files you can download it's just buried where's danny's  assault on the media all right here we go danny uh it's right under steve the whistler's appearance 
[01:46:00]  danny to date has gotten nine thousand eight hundred and forty two hits that's very respectable  yes very respectable that was uh last monday i believe a week from uh a week ago today  and then nathaniel came to the plate last thursday and it's a different story he's up to  one hundred and twenty four thousand nine hundred seven downloads oh wow that is sad 
[01:46:30]  nice job interloper thank you you're going places son you're going places he had the uh revenge of the  sith weekend breaking all kinds of records oh man i saw star wars we can get into that next yes rich  voss is here we're supposed to continue he is the first show we ever did rich is here yeah voss i saw  him outside and of course don't forget to pick up your collector item t-shirt today anthony wow no

[01:47:30]  course and they'd lose your day the memos went out of course and these won't stop no these will not  stop we will search out live shots we know how this works we're waiting for one of these to get major  exposure and now it's just going to be a it's just going to be a feeding frenzy out there it's just  going to get ugly now and it doesn't just have to be uh heroes like nathaniel out there in the  trenches anybody that sees a live shot if you can whip up a sign really quickly and uh pop that behind  the camera it's all we ask no harassing of the reporter don't touch you don't touch him at all you just 
[01:48:00]  get back there and uh you know hey ona xm satellite radio hold up the sign and your mission is uh  accomplished if you can get the guy fired like nathaniel did all the better i guess that's right  who cares if his children aren't gonna eat so you can get a little face time that's what matters  that's the important thing good boy we also have francine here who wants to do the news oh really cool  maybe we could do that next get a little news because there's a lot going on in the world as well 
[01:48:30]  and we're going to learn about that all right she's good her news is the wet bagel it's the same  thing where is ricky i haven't seen that boy since you i dressed him down i sure did you gave him a  talking to a talking to perhaps a bit more and i noticed the travis bagel was uh it was delicious  like a martini it was wonderful it was perfectly toasted nice and warm still max in dallas what's up max 
[01:49:00]  keep it short keep it short  danny's assault is the puppy that got ran over by nathaniel says she'd be pushed now boys  oh like little rudy in the driveway you bet you know because you know danny was checking out 9 000  that's not bad you figured he's using the same eric logan three people per assault almost 30 000  people a lot of these people you download a video clip you call your friend over you go hey check  this out you email it right so it's not just like that many people are uh you know out of those 
[01:49:30]  nine thousand downloads probably five thousand are danny and his and his family it's yeah mom and dad  and it's all boy half of them are like this isn't the f-bomb one damn yeah no one curses on this one  where's the good one start the start dumb son just running around with a sign that doesn't get on  camera it's just like him holding up and oh you work for cheerios what a honey nut cheerios commercial  idiot oh wait all right you know what someone just reminded us of another assault on the media 
[01:50:00]  that we're playing right now in studio here are you gonna get this up on open anthony.com yeah  this one is i gotta tell you the today's show flashing was unbelievable the c word thing was  unbelievable what nathaniel did was obviously unbelievable we all forgot about uh what was  his name uh maurie uh maurie alter maurie alter maurie alter outside the david letterman studio  i guess this was when dave was having his heart problems and it was either his first day back 
[01:50:30]  or i don't know when the story was breaking that he was gonna have open heart surgery or whatever  and all of a sudden it was an icy night in new york city so a couple dopes  you got it called no i actually they're not heroes they're heroes actually two uh have you  ever seen this jimmy oh my god watch this i know this is uh radio but you get you can see the video  for yourself later today they knock into maurie because it's the sidewalk is icy and maurie's still  trying to do his um his stand-up uh outside the late show theater and in the background uh uh uh uh 
[01:51:00]  i don't want to call it a fight but just a uh disturbance a disturbance and a scuffle  is going on as they're trying to uh pull the wow sign away from the guys that did this assault  on the media look at the security jumps out of the news van the door flies open security comes running  out and uh he he got through his story yeah maurie didn't uh turn around and start cursing what i  remember what he did also the camera guys like screw maurie look what's going on and the camera guy like 
[01:51:30]  you know focuses on what's happening behind maurie and maurie actually said something to the  to this effect he goes back on me he's like no come back at me come back on me back on me and  he finished the story like a professional the the sidewalk was so icy that these guys wanted to do  the quick assault they want to run show the sign and get out up behind maurie put the sign up and  then run away so they run up to him the sidewalk is so icy they slide right into him he's he's trying  to do his story and they bang into him and then they're trying to run away on the icy sidewalk and 
[01:52:00]  that's when all hell broke loose security came running out they were yelling forgot that's one  of my favorite they come running out of the news truck yep and then they grab the sign there's  like a tug of war going on and stuff that was a fun one and they got away so there you go that  psycho marker it was psycho mark again come on years later we can say who it is all right it's uh  opian anthony.com we got the the a-bomb now up again the today show flashing and now the maurie 
[01:52:30]  alter assault for you uh for you folks that have never seen you know it was a great assault on the  media it was that time on tough crowd when your old pal had that 25 minute shirt on tv that's  right is that not a good one that was a very very good one because everyone concentrates on those two  big tits and they see the opian anthony name aha boy then but i noticed when you're on leno you you  know you didn't have the opian anthony t-shirt yeah nor will i in june when i do it again  we got to take a break man that's right we're gonna be running by the way uh just to just 
[01:53:00]  see for fairness fairness sake uh uh uh danny this weekend uh there was a uh one of someone  in his family was having a party and they held up a video camera and he ran in with an opian anthony  sticker and showed it on that video camera so that's floating around actually all you can see is what  danny's obsessed though i think danny's going to come back strong you just watch you just watch  we kidnap a kid some amber alert thing creep this is rich boss you might recognize me uh if you were 
[01:53:30]  on the train today you are listening to the worst of opian anthony xm 202 the opian anthony show  hey we had the guys from mythbusters and i wasn't here for this  i love the myth but mythbusters show i wasn't here for this man and we care why because i had to  leave do you like the show mythbusters you watch it no no they certainly don't why i love that show 
[01:54:00]  i did yeah it was actually good last week they had a camera in a restaurant they showed black people  tipping jesus i guess that myth was busted yes some people actually tipping yes yeah that happens  thank you what else was on that particular show jimmy um they showed uh ben pulling his pants down and  he had a little penis ah that myth was actually proven true though because it was a giant hog they 
[01:54:30]  pulled it down expecting to see a little wiener oh you're right that's right they said it was little  only because they were comparing it to the washington monument  all right well mythbusters they they were in studio and we hung out with them and we talked a  little science with those guys science and uh during this bit vos who was filling in for jimmy that day  he was uh completely asleep on the couch he fell asleep on the couch good job rich i don't know if you 
[01:55:00]  can really hear it in the bit i don't know if we refer to it i think we do but barely but yeah the  update on the bit boss was so tired he passed out on the lesbian couch he was snoring and drooling  during this whole interview anyway here you go a bit for you to enjoy those guys the mythbusters are  really cool do you want to ask him something before you leave well me and my boys are big fans of their 
[01:55:30]  show really yeah yeah they're smart they blow things up they do educational things i've watched the show  many times yeah they're good like that yeah well let's get the guys from mythbusters in here eric  it's a very fast-paced show they got don't scare anybody step away from that chair a little bit you  freak yeah because these guys aren't gonna know how to handle you yeah they are it's jamie and adam  how you doing guys very good how are you yeah very good i'm like starstruck now i watch the show 
[01:56:00]  every single time it's on freaking out sexual celebrities to me really anybody else they drag  in here like you know ozzy came in and of course jimmy norton's a big fan of ozzy osbourne and he sat down  but it was just like and ozzy but you guys are like you know i watch you on tv you're like real  celebrities to me do you want kenny to ask the first question before he goes downstairs oh this  guy's six four and he's big and stupid he's really yeah he's very stupid here he is you were calling 
[01:56:30]  me but yeah he likes to uh he likes the show can he be nice to our guests no i'm excited and jamie  from mythbusters no i i gotta get their autograph for my boys really yeah they're huge fans we never miss  a show these guys do cool stuff they blow things up they play with mannequins that's what i like  yeah what's your question do you ever learn anything no that's impossible you know that's  impossible yeah it's just beyond comprehension for me but these guys look really smart they are smart 
[01:57:00]  yeah yeah they got a cool show i'm telling you all right what's the question to me when i'm telling  you something what's the question no hi hi how are you doing no i'm not hi you have nothing  now see see how witty he was would you go out and give out to you don't have anything you don't  have a question thank you mythbusters for coming to the opening anthony show our pleasure all right  i'm sorry for having us all right sorry for that distraction all right so back to anthony here adam 
[01:57:30]  and jamie from mythbusters in studio yes i wanted i absolutely want to know how you uh hooked up with  the show because it seemed like one of those things that uh maybe if if you just gave the idea out to  somebody it didn't seem like it might catch on but it's really really caught on well i know a lot  of people that watch it and enjoy it well actually the uh the idea came to the mind of our producer  peter reese who was a producer for a show on discovery called beyond 2000 for about 10 years  yeah a technology magazine style show and he thought up the idea for mythbusters and pitched it to 
[01:58:00]  discovery and uh when they were looking around for talent he had actually interviewed jamie and i as  part of the original robot wars the precursor to battle box back in like 1996 well jamie was a  competitor with his uh lethal robot blendo blendo yeah it was about the nastiest thing that had ever  been made at that point and so we had four matches and none of them lasted longer than about four  seconds what type of bot was it it was the first of what they call spinners and so it was essentially a 
[01:58:30]  150 pound flywheel spinning at about 500 pound or 500 rpm i noticed the flippers usually did better  against the spinners well not against our spinners not against yours no no they uh we just had to  touch them and it was over just flying we had this we had the distinction of when battle bots finally  came we could see that the arena accommodated for blendo specifically really with the roof on the arena  because we kept tossing pieces of our opponents up over the barrier and into the audience and that's 
[01:59:00]  why they have an element of fun to the whole thing yeah exactly i put it this way um when blendo was spun  up it was the equivalent of getting hit by a chunk of brass the size of your fist going to the speed  of sound that was the math damage well so when peter called up jamie and uh back in i think the  beginning of 2002 and said would you be interested in hosting this show the science show on discovery  channel and jamie said well uh i i think i might be interested but i'm not sure i'd actually be dynamic 
[01:59:30]  enough to hold a show on my own but uh i've got this friend and together we might make a good team  and we shot a 14 minute demo reel we sent to them and apparently they loved it they sent it to discovery  and discovery said to us these are just the geeks we were looking for really and apparently they said  to each other just what we need a couple of homosexuals from san francisco but we're not gay we're not gay  you make the beret look cool again though bro i gotta give it to you yeah man i i definitely the 
[02:00:00]  the personalities uh are definitely different i watched the um the kind of like the uh outtake  show that you you guys put together which is really really funny and uh i it seems like a lot of  people kind of goof on you jamie a little bit about your personality and you're kind of you know the  business guy out of out of the crew well they goof on both of us and um you know i i i think the the  choice of us as a team turned out to be a really good call um that might not be apparent when you  watch the show and that's because we have uh what i think of as binocular vision when we're dealing with 
[02:00:30]  a subject we're coming at it from such different personalities and and points of view that it it  really displays the subject matter which i mean we clown around a lot we have a lot of fun but  ultimately uh we'd like to get as much science in there because that's you know you may watch the  show because it's funny but um you'll stay with the show because there's a lot of interesting  content in it i'm a complete techno geek so you know i i just love when you guys and and what you 
[02:01:00]  were just talking about the uh when you have to um attack a problem and build two separate things  alone the the way you guys go about it it's just hysterical at the differences i mean you really adam  you really come off as like the clown that just you look and go how did he even get that to work  kind of thing and you always expect jamie to uh to build a better machine than yours sorry i don't  mean to insult you or anything i'd like to point out the personality just comes out hey i'd like to 
[02:01:30]  point out that i found a needle in a haystack first that is true i did see that you're a little uh wait  how do you go about finding the needle in the haystack well they gave us they gave us uh four different  needles uh of different sizes small medium really large and then they gave us this bone needle and of  course the first thing we both think of is some type of magnetic finder or metal detector the bone  needle made it exponentially more difficult so actually jamie used fire to burn all of his hay  and look through the ashes for the for the small bits uh and i used water to actually these these 
[02:02:00]  agitating paddle wheels that fed the hay through a trough and hopefully the bone needle would fall  to the bottom and i also had magnets to find the the uh we both had magnets to find the metal needles  and uh our producer of course always liking a good challenge gave us a thousand pounds of hay  which is like if you fluffed it is enough to fill this room about four times yeah yeah and you know  well adam's worked better mine was cooler it was fire is always cool and that's part of the show that 
[02:02:30]  i think everybody loves and and i envy you guys the the amount of explosives you guys get to use  is uh amazing and and each time it seems to be like you're getting more and more well yeah i mean  the the the most recent really large one we did blowing up the cement the cement truck was amazing  what was that one about well we uh the myth is can you use a stick of dynamite to clean out uh cement  that's hardened in the side of a cement truck you've heard about the uh there is a myth out there that  some guy had uh left the cement in the cement truck and it dried and then they used uh dynamite to to loosen 
[02:03:00]  it up yeah and it turned out that a single stick of dynamite inside a truck with little residue in  it is i mean we don't want to recommend it but it it actually works quite well yeah because it just  kind of sends out a shock wave and it loosens the stuff and it makes it easier to clean out but  of course it looks really boring yeah there's smoke yeah there's this yeah so uh doing what we do on the  show we had to uh take it as far as we could and that involved eight eight hundred pounds of what is 
[02:03:30]  called anfo which is uh uh you know a fertilizer diesel fuel mix and we had to be about a mile  and a half away to um see what that would do the truck disappeared the camera was a mile away and  parts of the truck flew over the camera wow and when we tried to get this is actually one of the things  we love about the show we tried to get a permit to actually blow up a cement truck and it turned out  there's nobody in the world licensed to use enough explosives to blow up a cement truck so our researchers who 
[02:04:00]  are this brilliant team of four researchers that can get us to do anything uh found that well why  don't we go to the guys who write the permits even if a permit doesn't exist and she got the fbi bomb  squad great idea to agree to hold a training exercise oh is that what it was yeah that's what they called  it and i mean we the fbi bomb squad i have to say is the tightest crew we've ever worked with those  guys are great they also helped us out on uh uh a myth for well we're hosting shark week this july oh you  are and uh they helped us out on the myth for shark week uh can you blow up a can you blow up a scuba 
[02:04:30]  tank by shooting it with a 30-06 from jaws of course yeah we've learned not to egg on the normal pyros  because uh you know there can be problems but the uh the bomb squad the fbi they you know you can't  mess with them they're going to do what they know how to do and and you'll be safe i'm amazed at some of  the stuff you you get away with doing yeah you would think that nobody would ever allow you to do this  when you took the uh the jet engine and uh the rumor of course is that the the the thrust coming 
[02:05:00]  out of the jet engine could flip the vehicle over you ever see that one i've heard i've heard the  myth sure yeah it happened down in rio de janeiro and yeah that was actually one of i think it was one  of our single great failure that myth yeah because we were down in the mojave desert and we we were trying  to find someone with that with a 747 that they would turn on and let us have a car behind and we found  that out in the mojave desert airport there is uh they mothball planes out there because it's  perfect no precipitation the weather is great and i've heard about that they retire planes 
[02:05:30]  out in the middle of the desert right yeah yeah because they last forever out there so there's  these companies that take these planes out of the out of the hangars every month and just start them up  to make sure the engines keep running and we were like we just want to be behind one of these planes  when you turn it on and they were totally cool about it we're standing out there on the runway we've got a  747 it's just about to fire presence we've got a remote control taxi cab right here and the  insurance company's on the phone with us saying we're no longer comfortable with doing this you  can't do it and we're thinking do we just do it do we just push the car 50 feet forward and say screw 
[02:06:00]  it yeah and it was so frustrating because what's the the the plane gonna suck the car around the front  of the intake you know it's way behind the jet you know the jet is going to push the car away from  the airplane what's the problem you guys look like you're pretty safe at what you're doing even  though it's insane some of the things one of the most unsafe things was adam inside the remote control  car that jamie was he was controlling with a remote and or not controlling it proceeded to just drive 
[02:06:30]  straight into a fence well we had a little problem with them with some switches what can i say oh is  that it yeah a couple problems with the uh switches yeah there was something that didn't  he lost control the best my favorite part of that is as you as the car's driving away and the staff  is all kind of watching in horror you hear me go jimmy from the inside of the car how did you get into  like how do you get insurance for those things it's it seemed impossible well we have a routine that we 
[02:07:00]  work work through with regard to the insurance and our safety in general which we're very concerned  about and uh it's a it's like a flow chart that we developed specifically for mythbusters and it uh  uh you know it rates the the the risk and the the probability of having a problem with that risk  and it it sort of is one of these things where you know you you kind of follow the numbers and you end  up in the if you end up in the really far corner you know it's it's in the black zone and that's a 
[02:07:30]  problem and we've noticed we're always in the black zone other stuff that you just what's the worst  thing that can happen well we could drop a car on somebody and how likely is that well even if it's  really unlikely the fact that it means death we're in the black zone are the things that you just  couldn't do based on insurance or or somebody we always figure out a way of doing it yeah even if  it means doing it like a replica of it or something else but or doing it with the crash test dummy  while we're all standing behind a bunker yeah you ever afraid you're going to run out of myths 
[02:08:00]  well uh not at all you know the the answer to that one is when are people going to start doing stupid  stuff you know yeah there's no end of the stuff and and really by this point the fans have really  dialed into what works and doesn't work on the show and about 30 of the myths we test now come  right off the discovery fan site and emails that jamie and i get directly that's cool people are  really plugged in someone on the instant feedback is writing in saying uh the best episode was when  uh one of you guys went across the san francisco bay in the raincoats like the escape from alcatraz 
[02:08:30]  the escape from alcatraz that's much they've said for years can't be done right that's my personal  favorite because you know there's been a lot of reenactments of it uh they've done it on a lot of  tv shows but jamie and i read all 1800 pages of the fbi report we went to the maritime museum in san  francisco where they have all the artifacts from the investigation we looked at them and i think our  builders eyes were the first to really come up with a truly accurate rendition of the boat they probably 
[02:09:00]  made and it we had no ideas my favorite is when we have no idea what's going to happen and we had  no idea if this boat was going to be remotely seaworthy and jamie climbs in and squirms across  the bottom in the middle of the night north of alcatraz and that thing carried us all the way to the  golden gate bridge in like an hour three and a half miles yeah and it was the same conditions that  they uh exact same tidal conditions same temperature same weather same wind we really really went the  extra mile and and the the the boat was built out of 24 rubber raincoats yeah we even had to go to 
[02:09:30]  the trouble of finding actual latex raincoats like what they would use in those days right and most of  them are vinyl or some some other plastic today so it was it was very authentic and we had to climb  through those little holes yeah we had to climb through the holes that they dug in the cells they  were like sure go ahead and i was amazed that we were both able to fit that isn't uh some of the roughest  things you've done though because uh adam i i've seen i've seen you go above and beyond with the uh  the goldfinger uh well i have contributed at this point every single major body fluid to the show 
[02:10:00]  yeah to the name of science except except for spinal fluid we haven't done that he's not afraid of the  anal probe whoa hey well there was uh there there's the myth that uh the uh girl in goldfinger the movie  goldfinger painted with the gold paint that she died because uh she couldn't breathe her skin uh you  need some kind of a you need to be able to breathe through your skin so uh they leave that strip uh 
[02:10:30]  down the spine so you could breathe and uh well it's total crap yeah it's it's crap and and adam tried  it out so they painted him gold and they wanted to monitor everything his heart rate core body  temperature core body temperature so they actually stuck at the monitor of his ass as he's just  standing there on television and all of a sudden he starts singing moon river  that old gag right that uh you're not you're not the shy one no well you know that that the emt who  actually did that sanjay he uh we use the same emt company for a lot of our myths so we're real 
[02:11:00]  familiar with those guys sanjay hasn't been out since then really yeah i think he's got a little too  much crap from his co-workers for because i asked him if he'd respect me in the morning yeah let's uh  let's go to the phones and they have exploded say hi to floyd hey floyd hello we have jamie and adam  from uh mythbusters in studio today yeah guys i got a problem with your myth that you did uh with the  cell phone at the uh gas station i deliver fuel for a living and uh you guys apparently disproved that myth 
[02:11:30]  or busted it but uh you know in our constant training we have continual videos where the  fire department and they've caught videos just uh at local gas stations that uh have caught people  using their cell phones that create fires well what we found in our research was that there was  not a single recorded case in the entire world of a confirmed cell phone starting a fire that it is  likely if you're using your cell phone and filling up your tank and getting in and out of your car you're 
[02:12:00]  building up a static charge and we proved absolutely that static electricity is more than enough to  ignite gasoline fumes at the pump and that's a very dangerous situation and someone talking on  their cell phone might be more likely to not be paying attention to what they're doing but that  there is and we also can uh consulted with the petroleum equipment institute pei which is the uh world  authority on um petroleum devices like the gas pumps and uh and accidents at the pumps they compile all 
[02:12:30]  the data on accidents at pumps i think they have a little more info than the guy that just called it  awesome thing i'd give it to these guys over here don't get me wrong i'm all for an industry airing on  the side of caution yeah it's just it's a and we you know every time someone's cell phone battery blows  up in their pocket we get an email but when you consider that there's probably a billion uh uh what do you  call them like aftermarket batteries out of china in everybody's pockets we can't find the battery  that's been misbuilt that's going to short we try and while you're filling up your gas tank exactly 
[02:13:00]  and and there's also an interesting thing that we found out recently um the fbi bomb squad and other  people that handle explosives are um in a habit of in fact they make a rule of not having any radio  transmissions in the area when they're dealing with explosives uh however they're not so concerned  about the cell phones as they are about the uh like a high powered uh police portable radio or  something like that it is apparently possible to create a spark from a radio transmission 
[02:13:30]  it's just that cell phones themselves have such a low wattage that it's it's virtually impossible for  that to happen as far as we're aware every time i see the uh on the gas pump don't use your cell phone  now i think of the myth buster well you know one thing that one thing the petroleum equipment institute  did tell us was in their compilation of figures per year that in the two years since our first test  of that aired that uh static electricity accidents has at gas stations have gone down 60 percent 
[02:14:00]  so we might have actually saved four or five lives with our show all right let's go to texas anthony  uh texas what's up hey how's it going you guys all right all right how are you doing good i just  wanted to call in uh jerry adam love the show favorite thing looks like awesome i'm a big  freaking geek and i catch it every week and it's on tivo so i can watch it again another question i had  is uh are the season dvds coming out or are they out and if so were they available uh there are dvds  available through the discovery website however um there's a bit of a lag time we're not sure what 
[02:14:30]  exactly they're up to right now but you can get some of them and there will be more in the future i'm  sure all right sorry about that let's go to carry in california trying to give everyone a shot here  carry what's up hey guys uh you guys did a myth about blowing up various things in the sun in your  car yeah and uh i got a 200 bill that says this pop bottle will blow up in your car  yeah you know that was a uh that was my bad oh really yeah i totally screwed that one up we we 
[02:15:00]  the myth is about a soda can or an aerosol can exploding with a lot of force in the back of a hot car  and uh when it came to the end of a day of we're able to actually get uh get these things to blow up  in very hot environments but that it was unlikely for cars to get that hot and it turns out that all  over the country there are plenty of places where cars actually get up to like 190 to 200 degrees in  a car and that's enough to uh to heat up certain cans of soda or aerosol to blow up which also brings up one 
[02:15:30]  of myth best mythbusters favorite lines and that is that failure is always an option you know with us  it's one thing i got to say about the show for the viewers out there uh we're not so concerned about  providing definitive proof about some scientific fact uh we're more interested in the process  for uh it's for us personally and for viewers of the show you know the the most valuable thing that 
[02:16:00]  we've got to offer on the show is following us through as we're trying to figure these things  out sometimes we get it right sometimes we get it wrong if we get it wrong we'll often have another  go at it that's one of those um uh stories that we may well have another go at yeah we're willing to  say that we're wrong you know it's not science jamie's got a degree in russian and i've got a high  school diploma we have no qualifications well and and as far as science um i think um real scientists that  contact us uh actually kind of point out the fact that that's what science is actually like it's not 
[02:16:30]  like these guys in white lab coats that show up and and you know just say this is the case it's a it's  an ongoing process science is is a very mushy thing that uh you you you learn a few things but it's not  often real clear-cut the process is the the most fun part of the show because obviously you would know  that you cannot jump in an elevator as it's free falling and live through it i don't think there's  anybody that's going to watch that and go hmm i wonder how this is going to work out but the process 
[02:17:00]  that you guys doing it the the fun of being able to drop an elevator like that it that's what uh  people uh tune in for there is a moment on every shoot about once a week when we all look around  and we're standing there there's a team of people downstairs in this abandoned crack hotel and  i'm upstairs with a 10 000 pound special lex quick release trying to release this elevator and  we're thinking what the hell are we doing who is paying to let us do this crap it's incredible 
[02:17:30]  oh what a great way to make a living uh the phones are just honestly just nuts  anthony and queens what's up hey what's up guys hey uh i got a quick question for the  miss buster guys yeah are you guys ever going to do the in hindsight it was a bad idea to light a  match myth yeah if you guys want some ratings well if you want to know i remember that let's  take it to the next level i have to tell you we have we're talking about the gerbil in the ass story  obviously oh that one remember that one in hindsight lighting the match was a bad idea it started and  it was sent as a legitimate news story picked up like a doctor did a press conference that talked 
[02:18:00]  about this well actually we want to do a whole special on things concerning farts and uh that would  fit right in there but we're not allowed to say the word fart on the show but really facts about  flatulence i think we can cover a wide range of things that have never been covered on television  and our challenge is to do it in a tasteful manner good luck i like that one of my favorites also  involving uh rank smells was the the dead pig inside the car you know in humid days you can still 
[02:18:30]  catch a whiff of it from jamie's parking lot really there's someone saying that's the most disgusting  thing you guys have done they took uh what was the myth the myth is uh the myth is that somebody  died in a classic car and their family member cleaned them out as it were but they couldn't  sell this classic car even for a great deal because mint condition mint condition beautiful car they  couldn't sell it because someone had died and they just couldn't get rid of the smell so you took dead  pigs yeah we got a i believe it was an 87 corvette and at first we just kind of put the pig in there and 
[02:19:00]  let it set for a while and then the whole area out in front of the shop was like you know really  started to get weird and uh so we get packing tape and we're taping up all the corner all around the  door seals and we let that sit for a while and then that didn't work and so finally we got a container  shape shipping container and put it in there and sealed it up for a few months sealed it up but you  know we had we had time lapse cameras uh stuck in here but even they couldn't handle it they kept 
[02:19:30]  failing because of the ammonia concentration yeah wow and that turned out to be the biggest problem  with the car was that the corrosion from all of these gases and fluids and things that kind of leave  the pig and go elsewhere uh are extremely corrosive and you know we would have had to pull the dash and  strip out every single little thing this this car had computerized things in it and you know it it  just was while you could in fact uh you know get the smell out of a car it turned out to be totally 
[02:20:00]  impractical down to this stuff is down to the point of where you would have to remove every single nut  and bowl to like completely pull it out of where whatever it was screwed into and clean the threads  with a toothbrush and a special yeah enzyme and then put it back this stuff is so this juice that was  coming off the pigs which by the time we had to clean them out were more like a hairy bony pudding  than oh my god and this juice that came off them was so powerful in its smell that i could take a 
[02:20:30]  single drop of it put it somewhere in your car and you just want to sell your car yeah really and you  never get rid of the smell we had this uh this great guy that was a crime scene cleaner that's what  he made his living from do you remember the name of that his name is neil smither and he he discovered  his life's mission watching the scene where they cleaned up the body out of the car in pulp fiction  yeah all right and he's now got this company called crime scene cleaners they have deals with  hotels in a meth lab you know that that company or one that's very similar well when they go through  it when we opened it when we opened the door to the that corvette and he was standing there watching 
[02:21:00]  just laughing you know as we're just squirming you know uh he offered uh one of us five thousand  dollars to lick the pig and he was good for it the guy makes a lot of dough and i knew he was good  for it and i looked at the pig and i looked at him and i was like he goes and i don't mean no tongue  touching either i was like oh give it a good lick and people now say to me oh man i would have done  it and i was like if you were there no way you would not have done it yeah you know if you mention  that story to both of us we we it's kind of hard to describe but we both kind of get quiet for a 
[02:21:30]  little bit you know remembering what we went through i mean i had to get into that car and sit on what was  left of the pig that was in the driver's seat just to move the car just to get the car out of the  condition they had to close the door around me and you know and what was inside the car actually and  we were wearing respirators but what was inside the car wasn't anything like air anymore it wasn't  like stinky air it was something else something from another planet yeah i needed i like needed a 
[02:22:00]  separate air source to be able to deal with that and change jamie's dna all right let's go to the  phones let's go to florida ryan what's up hey i love the myth busters yeah definitely jamie and adam  in studio ah the best episode ever was one where they blew up the house with the bug bombs yeah i got  an idea for a myth form to bust how do you got get pat knock in there and see how much milk you can drink  before you actually hurl we yeah i don't know contest of uh during christmas some big fat guy came up and 
[02:22:30]  drank eggnog we saw how much eggnog he could drink until he uh puked it up how much was it like a couple  of gallons yeah gallon gallon and a half something like that gallon because i've heard you can't  drink a gallon of milk in less than an hour yeah this guy just stunned me it was eggnog too you  haven't done that myth yet on the show puking is always funny man and i have puked on the show yeah  but uh i've puked several times now yeah what's the blowing up the house one oh this is about somebody 
[02:23:00]  who wanted to get rid of bugs in their houses they went and got bug bombs and you know bug mom says it's  good for 800 square feet or something like that you hear about this every so often it happens in california  all the time seven or eight times a year and so they went and got 40 bug bombs set them all off  in their house and we we made a little we we did a lot of bench testing with this and we made uh  several ignition sources like a stove igniter a wire short a static spark and again that's the fun part  is watching how you guys come up with these ways of igniting these things or working making the stove turn 
[02:23:30]  on and everything living a light switch yeah and everything we tried ignited the bug bomb stuff so we got  a we got a house actually down at a military base moffett field in uh in california and uh  we set off 40 bug bombs and we were really hoping for a lot more destruction yeah but uh in the end it  blew these uh double pane tempered glass back doors out and on the high street camera you can see them  bowing like really a good five or six inches before popping out of their frame the flames come shooting 
[02:24:00]  out the door yeah i like that one the other one uh you crack me up when the uh you take the dummy and  dropped him into the uh water and uh off the crane oh yeah that was called the hammer drop and the  premise the premise with that one was that if you throw a large object or something like a hammer in  front of you that you'll break the uh water tension if you're say like jumping off a bridge or falling  off a bridge and that aeration or loss of water tension would allow you to survive an otherwise deadly 
[02:24:30]  fall but um no no no it didn't work and he was so mangled that uh adam for some reason the worst  beating the dummy takes the more you laugh oh god it comes out like you just you've never heard  anything like so like that body hitting the water from 200 feet it was shocking and and and then to  fact to find this crash test dummy which is you know what we expected when we first got the crash  to somebody's you could do anything to it and to find that merely dropping him into the water would 
[02:25:00]  shatter his cast steel shoulders i mean it was appalling well recently there there's a episode  that we just finished another visit to mojave that involved a story about whether you can um survive a  crash from an airplane by jumping out first and hanging on to the uh the the escape slide or the life  raft and it was kind of it was done in indiana jones right yeah and so we get a hold of this big  helicopter and we get all of these inflatable life things and and uh there were a couple of times that 
[02:25:30]  before the um uh before we really got our act together that buster simply fell out you know  because there wasn't anything really good to hold on to on on the life wraps the little strings and  things up from 2000 feet yeah he falls from 2000 feet and every single uh part of his body was  separated it was just like seeing a you know a grenade go off with the little bits going everywhere for for 
[02:26:00]  quite some while and i was up in the helicopter i'm hanging out the side of this like 1950 sikorsky  helicopter and i'm looking down at from 2000 feet above the desert floor and it is a total wily  coyote moment because i watch buster go until he is no longer visible and then there's a puff smoke  oh that's great it really is uh your background uh with with movies especially uh adam i was i was  looking at your bio you worked on star wars i worked on the first two star wars films uh jamie's 
[02:26:30]  worked on films as far back as robocop and arachnophobia really um you're a model maker yeah yeah i  worked at industrial light and well i got my start working for jamie actually on commercials like  uh nike hershey's kisses owens corning coca-cola and of course charman of cool yeah i played mr whipple's  stock boy in the charman commercial i'm no kidding back around like 1982 you are famous i guess you were 
[02:27:00]  squeezing it i uh no actually i was the stock boy jimmy and i was nervous because the roof was leaking all  over the new charman and i guess mr whipple's really cheap because he was still willing to sell  it because new charman is stronger when wet it's sort of like atoms come full circle you know dealing  with things involving bodily fluids well actually it involved this nearly pornographic line where  that he shows me the quarter trick with the towelettes you know and now it can still hold the  quarters and i say gosh mr whipple that's what i call wet strength 
[02:27:30]  oh yeah oh that's one for the christmas take christmas party now uh did you see the new star  wars i actually i was going to go to a matinee today oh really yes all right yeah i saw it very  good i liked it much better than the the previous two that he put out i want to find out if i can take  my six-year-old twin boys to it probably not unless you're like the cool dad who you know my father took  me to bonnie and clive when i was like seven years old or something like that yeah my parents 
[02:28:00]  took me to sharky's machine when i was like nine and i remember running out screaming at the killer  freebacer happy parents and let's go back to the phones here and say hi to dan dan what's up  hey what's going on guys hey uh i got a question for adam uh last season you had a date one night and  you wound up singeing all the hair off your uh eyebrows and head yes how'd the date go the date went  just fine thank you and uh did you shave everything else to match no it turned out only the top part was 
[02:28:30]  singed and with some good scrubbing you couldn't even i didn't even smell that burnt a little more  flame action uh i can't remember which one that was why uh that was actually the early testing on  uh cell phone destroys gas station we were trying to create an environment where we got a static spark  to ignite a small chamber of gasoline and as as often happens on the show we spent three days just  trying to prove gasoline is flammable we were we were really flummoxed by it and it once by the time it 
[02:29:00]  finally ignited we were so blasÃ© and so kind of well nothing's going to happen that i had my face  right up against this thing and big fireball kind of enveloped my head front of his hair was wow and  his eyebrows okay we found that adam kind of gets frisky after he gets hurt in fact the uh the the last  time the most notable time that he did this involved the vacuum cleaner um motor that he and adam would  you care to tell us what happened after you got hurt by that one i've heard about this one as well yeah we  were testing out some vacuum cleaner motors and this guy at the vacuum cleaner shop handed me what 
[02:29:30]  he said was the most powerful motor we turned it on and felt really powerful and i was like you know  put my hand up to it like this and i thought and so i for some reason i kind of put my lips up to it and  i didn't know that it would yank my lips like a full inch and a half into its blades but it did  and i had this total fight club you know bloody teeth kind of moment and i actually went home that  night and asked my girlfriend to marry me oh will you marry me romantic baby give us a kiss 
[02:30:00]  really fast we got a guy that cleans up uh dead bodies for a living keith  hey oh man what's up and myth busters rule you guys rock thank you hey uh i just called because  i wanted to let you guys know you did the best that you possibly could to uh describe what a dead  body smells like and i used to clean them up for a living um sometimes they'd be there two three months  sometimes they'd be there a couple days and you never ever get that smell out of your nose and  you just can't possibly get the point across to anybody how bad a human body or even a pig because 
[02:30:30]  i guess that's the most similar right oh yeah yeah they're the most similar you can't get that you  can't get the point across to people how bad and how amazingly horrible that smell is when the body  became smell that dead body smell you know even if you're walking around your yard the cat had died  or something that waft hits you you know exactly what it is and it's you know exactly so pungent  now the only thing that comes a close second would be uh homeless poo 
[02:31:00]  here in manhattan you catch a lot of that  talking about tippy tom's excrement yeah but uh the best one i have for you guys is it's a real  quick one two two to three months uh this poor lady was uh on her bed uh had fallen out of bed broke  her neck and uh laying on the floor she decayed everything except for her leg and she whipped up into  the drywall about six feet and uh amazing smell and at home the flies and everything else that  took over the whole place punch it out see you boys lovely story uh you have a couple of uh  additions to the show now i've noticed uh some new new faces well there's just there's there's too many 
[02:31:30]  myths for jamie and i to bust in a single season we've got 26 28 episodes to do per year and uh there's  just not enough time so yeah we have a we have a b team of extra toss the little myths off to those  people and they do all the cute ones right yeah yeah i wouldn't call it the little miss at all i  mean it it's just a question of uh the fact that the show's become really popular it's one of the  cool stuff for yourselves well if it blows up i mean these guys if it involves fire we're doing those 
[02:32:00]  no not at all i mean the we we definitely have our um we we get the pick of the of the lot of the  litter i think but uh this uh the uh the second team or the b team is is just simply due to the fact  that um you know uh the show is we're not able to produce as much as as uh the viewers want and  actually a couple of two members of the beat we've we've got tori who's been on since last season  and carrie who actually carrie's first day as jamie's intern we scanned her butt for the airplane 
[02:32:30]  toilet myth uh and then we've just brought on uh grant imahara and both tori and grant are actually  alumni of mine from lucasfilm really they've both worked with me on the star wars films grant is  actually one of the three licensed r2d2 operators really yeah yeah that's a nice credit to have  and one of the one of the geeks oh yeah i love that one one thing about this show that may not  be evident is that you know and the need for the second team as part of this is that we actually know  what we're doing and we do all the work we we don't like hire people to come in and and set things up 
[02:33:00]  for us and then we show up and talk about it and that inherently is a very time consuming process  that that it just makes it difficult to crank out a whole lot of shows uh we're we're as a rule we're  just covered with bruises our hands are all cut up and and we're we're probably among the hardest  working people in tv right now we had it we had a second cameraman come out to mojave to help cover  cover the uh the shoot out there he was from california and he'd done a lot of work on fear factor 
[02:33:30]  and a lot of work on uh trading spaces on the learning channel with the carpenters and stuff  and he said because at the end of the day he says i got to tell you guys it's a real pleasure  to work with you and you're the only hosts i've yet worked with who actually do their own work really  yeah yeah a lot of them stand there when the camera's on hold the hammer and then i guess so  i found that kind of appalling it was like the the scales falling from my eyes and then now you  have carrie of course you've you mentioned her a lot of a lot of people writing in right now saying  that she's a very attractive she's the cute one here and you seem to i'm just thinking you're 
[02:34:00]  trying to maybe get a few more viewers that wouldn't normally stop on there when when you  have her in a bikini being painted uh and then crying she comes off as an emotional wreck sometimes  why are you painting her in a bikini you know it's funny we got a lot of i got a lot of angry  fan mail when when last season started with carrie and uh and scotty both females working on the show  and people said oh you guys sold out you're going for the hottie thing it's total crap and my thing 
[02:34:30]  is you well you can't win i'm happy to show i'm happy to show women actually being able to use tools  and being competent in the shop i think that's a that's a positive message message not a negative  message this is our we're almost done with our show that's our two minutes uh wow that went really  quick i know that was crazy all right this is jamie heineman and this is adam savage and you're  listening to the worst of opie and anthony endorsed by myth bust we've been hacking our  way through this jungle for days and there's our reward the ancient temple of delilah oh it's huge

The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, cousins.  Eee.  Eee.  Like we said in the 60s.  Eee.  Eee.  Yes.  The immortal Cousin Brucie from our oldie station here in New York has to find a new job.  And I guess what we're going to do here is play the time that you and I...  No, you know what?  This is an Anthony bit all the way.  And he did a stellar job.  Anthony acting like one of these oldies jocks. 
[02:44:30]  That's right.  And me writing lines and throwing them at him.  You did nothing.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Roppin'.  Tell him, Fred.  Shut up.  Fred's not saying shit.  No, Anthony is the star of this bit.  And I want to sit back and enjoy, once again, Anthony as a oldies jock.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Who said this over the weekend?  Okay.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge, that's how it says in the paper, by the way, instead of the, and George Washington Bridge is a raft. 
[02:45:00]  But you can't do that.  Any guesses?  Yankee Stadium is a fruit stand and George Washington...  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge is a raft.  You can't do that. 
[02:45:30]  I'm going to guess Voss because it's stupid.  Makes no sense.  What was the quote?  Oh, here's a thousand dollar deposit for a car that I haven't even seen in person yet.  Well, now you have to hit me.  That's a very vague thing.  It sounds like a Huck Finn or something referenced, but apparently it's not.  Now, what does this person do?  Do I know this person?  Well, he's in our business.  Technically.  It's like he's in the radio business.  Proving that this guy should just be spinning records.  Oh, wow.  That's all he does. 
[02:46:00]  I'm sorry.  That's all this guy does.  Spin records?  Yeah.  And they're making a big deal out of it.  It's like waking up in the morning and all of a sudden Yankee Stadium became a fruit stand and George Washington Bridge is a raft.  You can't do that, said the 67-year-old Moro who introduced the Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965.  Cousin Brucie?  Talking about Cousin Brucie, Anthony.  67?  That's a lie.  That guy's in his 70s.  Minimum.  Minimum.  Stop it.  I'm not a big Cousin Brucie fan, to be honest with you. 
[02:46:30]  Now that I know that Cousin Brucie is lying about his age, I'm ready to tell everyone how old I am.  That's right.  I am 34 years old, and I'm proud of it.  Ooh.  What does that mean?  What do you say about CBS not being there?  Well, it's big news.  CBS.  How about this?  No one cares if CBS is here.  Exactly.  No one cares.  Let's bring the whole country into this, though.  You know, it's because it's big news here in New York, and I think it's big news for radio as far as the rest of the country goes.  A lot of these oldies formats are going away fast. 
[02:47:00]  Oldies.  Really fast.  Infinity Broadcasting, our old company, they changed the format here of CBS FM in New York City, got rid of the oldies, and they did it in Chicago as well on Friday.  Yep.  And it's happening in a lot of cities across America.  It might even have happened in your city by now.  And they're replacing it with the Jack format.  Jack.  Oh, the radio industry, a buzz with Jack.  And that's where DJs play music, and they whack off live on the air, and Jack it. 
[02:47:30]  And they jack it.  Jack is jockless, I believe.  Jack is a format.  Basically, it's, you know how people have their iPods, and you throw everything in there.  You throw your Rolling Stones in there.  You throw your U2, the Beastie Boys.  Your Kajagoogoo.  Kajagoogoo, yeah, those guilty pleasures.  Yeah.  And then you hit shuffle on your iPod, and you, oh, you never know what's going to come up next.  I know what's coming up.  It's Sympathy for the Devil, and the next song is Too Shy Shy by Kajagoogoo, and it's exciting because it's just like, it's unfair. 
[02:48:00]  Olivia Newton-Johns, I honestly love you.  It's unpredictable.  Eclectic.  Eclectic.  It goes from White Stripes to, I don't know, Flack of Seagulls.  What are they finally admitting, that the program directors and that the playlists are shit and don't know what they're talking about?  Are they finally admitting that?  Is that what this is?  This is radio saying the program directors don't know what they're doing?  Yeah.  In this weird kind of format, I think they're acknowledging that, and that they don't want jocks wasting any time. 
[02:48:30]  I got to tell you, I heard the format change, so I switched over there, gave it a listen for about an hour, an hour and a half, and I heard maybe eight, nine songs.  Okay.  An hour and a half.  What was the rest of your life?  An hour and a half?  An hour and a half.  I heard so many commercials, couldn't even deal.  I'm so used to satellite radio now that I go to regular radio, and usually all I listen to on regular radio is news, so they don't usually hit you with these huge, long stop sets during news. 
[02:49:00]  It's a couple of commercials and then more news.  So to listen to a regular music station again, I couldn't believe it.  There was one point, I'm listening, I turn it on, and I hop in the shower.  The entire time until I started getting dressed, I didn't hear one song.  Not kidding.  Yeah.  As soon as I got to satellite radio over two and a half years ago now, I barely go back to commercial radio.  You can't even do it.  You greedy faggots in commercial have ruined it for yourselves. 
[02:49:30]  And people are running away from you.  The more commercials they play, the happier I am, because you're pushing people right to us.  Good.  Yep.  That's exactly what they're doing.  You suck, and you agree, just like with television, you're slaves to the advertisers.  And I understand advertising pays the bills, and you've got to have them.  But you become such slaves to it, you push people to an alternative.  Well, this is what I want to say.  This whole Jack format, it's popping up.  It has other names.  Actually, there's a station in Philly called Ben.  No way.  I swear, because there's Ben.  Is there Bob or something, too? 
[02:50:00]  Bob, Dave.  Dave.  Why do they just pull names out of their ass?  I have not.  Because that's how creative commercial radio is at this point.  Let's just call it after a very popular name.  Like, I know, Ethel or Fred.  Yeah, Fred.  Yeah, I guess XM's guilty of that, too, a little bit.  Mrs. Trumbull.  Someone in XM programming thought it'd be very clever to have an Ethel station and a Lucy station.  And a Fred.  Fred.  What about Ricky?  Well, why not just get all of them?  Oh, Ricky. 
[02:50:30]  You're listening to Ricky.  Here's Love Shack.  Oh.  Yeah, well, I also went to the New York radio message board when I heard about the CBS flipping.  Yeah, this is what we're getting at.  Anthony and I actually have a connection to the Jack format.  Jack.  We might have seen the Jack playbook back in the day if he was willing to open it up for us in that office that day.  The tool.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Gary Wall. 
[02:51:00]  Well, first of all, I go over to the New York radio message board that radio dentist Alan Sniffen runs.  And there's a bunch of posts about CBS, the demise of CBS.  And they're all upset about it.  They are all upset about it.  And they were treating it, I swear to you, some of these posts were like the same posts about 9-11.  But instead of like World Trade Center, put in CBS FM.  People were that busted up about this. 
[02:51:30]  One woman actually posted, this is truly going to be one of those days where you say, I remember where I was when I heard CBS was off the air.  And hopefully she was discovering she had cancer.  Idiot.  One of the, I read that and just out loud went, ugh.  I couldn't believe someone actually put a radio station changing a format in the same thing as Kennedy being shot, the Challenger exploding, jets flying into the Trade Center. 
[02:52:00]  I remember where I was when I heard, no you don't.  You won't remember.  You're stupid.  Well, these people, they grew up with the station.  That's the problem.  But, you know, with these listeners, they don't understand that the people that run these stations, they don't take it as serious as you.  They don't care.  They don't care.  As soon as the ratings drop or something, they're not trying to, you know, really fix this station.  They're like, ah!  All right, what else is hot out there?  All right, the jack format? 
[02:52:30]  All right, change format immediately.  Fire everyone.  Fire, fire, fire, fire everyone.  Obviously, it's all about selling and making money.  They want to make money.  Radio stations of business has to make money.  With the oldies format, your listeners are old people.  Old people, they're not known for really going out and buying these high-end items.  They're not known for buying things that are advertised a lot, that a lot of advertisers pay money to radio stations to advertise. 
[02:53:00]  You know, it just doesn't work.  So you try to get people to listen to a station that are younger and have that buying power.  And I like CBS.  I actually like some of the music they played.  I mean, Cousin Brucie's echo really annoyed me.  I guess that was his thing.  It's all the oldies things.  It was that reverb sound that they used to use way back when, and they just continued using it.  Yeah, it's so, it's so, ooh.  Dude, I listened to someone, like, I was listening to, it might have been 103.5 or something, or was it 100, where she hit the post. 
[02:53:30]  And I'm listening to, now, you know, the more, like, you're in radio, because you guys were in a lot longer than me, and, like, I kind of come in and, like, you start noticing shit.  Yeah.  And that, and that, that talk they do, that phony, hey, it's my birthday, can you play this?  Like, they called for requests on the, I mean, the only thing I ever requested on the radio, this is true, was the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald years ago on a New Jersey station, 98.3, and they never played it.  You really did?  Absolutely true.  Request that song?  Completely true.  And, uh, of course, they didn't play it.  You know, I listened all night.  I didn't know that they were just faggots who were married to a playlist.  That's what they'll say.  Yeah, yeah, we'll get it on for you. 
[02:54:00]  Well, I mean, requesting a song on the radio is the biggest gag in the business.  All the radio guys laugh about it, because even if you're a station that plays not a lot of commercials, you're still playing only 10 songs an hour to maybe 12, okay?  Yeah.  12 songs an hour, you know how many phone calls a DJ gets in one hour for requests?  At a music station?  Hundreds.  The phone is constantly ringing with song requests.  Ten lines ringing the entire time you're on the air, so do the math.  Let's say, safely, there's 100 calls an hour, all right, and you can only play 10 an hour. 
[02:54:30]  Do the math.  When are they going to get to your call?  And if you played every request, there's still 90 people that aren't hearing the request per hour.  And my job when I was in music is, like, you got your stupid playlist, and let's say you're playing, I don't know, Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven.  You wait for that dope from, I don't know, North Babylon to request Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven, and then you tape it.  You tape it.  And then you play that right before Stairway to Heaven.  Conveniently, the intro's playing as he's requesting the song. 
[02:55:00]  You'd have the whole hours.  We're all Crescans.  Yeah.  You'd have the whole playlist for your entire show right in front of you.  Yeah, so you look, it's for some songs, you look through it, and then you realize when a request comes through that sounds like a cool guy that you would want on the air requesting that song, you tape it.  Yeah.  And then you play it.  That's why sometimes it's like, yeah, you hear the intro to the song start up, and then you hear the phone call.  Let's go to the phones.  Hey, could you play Led Zeppelin?  Yeah, we're playing right now.  How about this? 
[02:55:30]  This is why these boars never became famous.  How about playing one request on the air where you're playing something else, and you go, no, I'm not playing that song.  It sucks, and so do you.  Click, and you play something else.  Right.  How about some kind of balls or originality to make it interesting?  There's nothing like that.  They hit the post.  They talk through the beginning, and I hate that.  I used to wonder, because when you don't know, you would wonder, how did he get the song on so fast?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like, someone requests a song, and you're like, wow, he's got it right there.  Is there a button or something that they can just press with these songs?  See, we're already talking to the converted, people that are fed up with commercial radio. 
[02:56:00]  It's too bad.  I would love to talk to commercial radio fans a little bit more, because these guys would get fired if they didn't play their list of songs.  That's the reality of it.  You can't just go, wow, this guy wants to hear Sunday Bloody Sabbath, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  No, Opie.  I know, Sabbath.  I was thinking on you, too.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  He would get fired if he played that on the air.  You know how I've gotten a request on the air?  I called Eddie Trunk when he was doing it. 
[02:56:30]  A, because, you know, I was on O&A, so they took the call.  But B, because he plays stuff that's no playlist.  Yeah.  I mean, if you like hard rock, Eddie Trunk is the show to listen to, because he always plays that shit, whatever you want.  I think that Boneyard would probably do that at any of these stations that aren't slaves to a playlist.  Ben has run in with a communique.  Uh-oh.  Urgent communique.  It's from Elo.  I guess he's back from vacation.  We haven't heard from him in, like, 10 days or something.  From Eric Logan to Ben Sparks.  Subject, oldies alive on XM.  Oldies alive on XM.  Tune into the 60s channel. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  Well, they have 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  Yeah, they're basically doing this format that is, you know, being taken away from all these cities on XM.  Yeah, it's the 60s channel, the 50s channel.  Yeah, but Elo.  CBS also played stuff from the 70s and the 80s.  They were sneaking into the early 80s, right?  Yeah, they were, like, doing that whole thing.  So you can't just replace CBS with just the 60s music. 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  Hey, I got my cock out.  They would always come back with things that made absolutely no sense.  Like, I guess in the old days they used to be able to talk it up, but now they got so old, like Cousin Brucie and everything.  I wouldn't understand what they were saying.  I'd be driving, listening, going, what is he talking about?  Right, well, it sounded like he was doing a show from a gymnasium with the echo. 
[02:58:00]  The big, booming echo.  That stunk, that echo.  It was not, it made it unlistenable.  Yeah.  That's what they do with the oldies format.  They're ready to rock and roll.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  And as we said in the 60s, eee.  Seizing.  Testing.  Can't you hear that groovy?  Everybody who loves the 60s, say, baby.  Shut up. 
[02:58:30]  I apologize. I thought that was a song he was talking. It was his own jingle. His own stupid jingle. I take that back.  Let's go to Dean in New Jersey. Dean, what's up?  Oh, how are you doing? It would be great if you guys could replay that bit where Ant tooled on that DJ from CBS who ranked on you guys. 
[02:59:00]  He tooled on him for about 10 minutes.  Oh, yeah. I remember that bit. We might have that around.  That was great. Hey, Ope, back to you, Swampwood.  Back to you, Swampwood.  I don't get the Swamp thing. Less stress in my life. I'm not swamping these days.  Is that what it is? Less stress?  You know that. I have so much less stress in my life.  No, I don't mean you have less stress. I mean, is it...  Yeah, those are brought on by...  Yeah, they're mostly brought on by stress. 
[02:59:30]  Really? Yeah, yeah.  I think stress really wrecks your body, man.  It really does.  It's impossible.  You know what? We could probably find that old CBS bit. It's a great story.  I don't know. We were always getting in trouble, and the gang at CBS, they took some shots at Anthony and I,  basically saying, I think they said something like monkeys could do our jobs or something.  I've cloned some monkeys.  They had... Bob Shannon said they had to clone some monkeys so you guys could take vacation.  Nuff.  Eric, shut up.  Jesus Christ. It's an endless babble fest with you.  We've heard. I hope he said it already. 
[03:00:00]  Monkeys.  Monkeys.  They just reiterate everything, he says.  Yeah, why don't you just comment on a Vietnam guy that Anthony might look like now while you're at it?  Who does he look like? Adrian Hill from Rocky?  Nuff.  Pipe up when you have something.  Yeah, but the guys basically said they could clone us so we could go on vacation or something like that,  and they took their little shot.  It was like a five-second shot they took, and then we ended up killing them for like an hour and a half on our show that day.  Danny, what's up?  They said the same thing after the tsunami song.  What's up, man?  Hey. 
[03:00:30]  Yes, sir. You're on the air.  I'm on the air.  Yes.  Not anymore.  Come on, guys.  What was that?  Is that a bit he was doing?  Was he, I'm shocked to be on the air, guy?  I'm on the air.  Be prepared to do what you want to do when we go to you.  Help us out a little bit here.  All right.  We could play that CBS bit.  No problem, actually.  Yeah, you got it?  It's a big day for oldies radio, and yeah, we had some fun tooling on that whole format.  Matt, what's going on?  Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101. 
[03:01:00]  Why?  Because he was just ripping you guys up, and he said that they wouldn't pay the newspaper,  that they just cloned them to monkeys.  Uh-huh.  Because now that you guys, now they have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys should take  a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody's talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  All right, guys.  Later.  Thank you.  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  That's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where the old jocks go to die. 
[03:01:30]  Hello, love.  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just the music station?  Don't they have, like, strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it is out,  and go to the next Shirelle song or something.  You have to go around the corner.  Hey, Donald, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was just listening to CBS.  My uncle had it on.  He said that they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And he said Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though. 
[03:02:00]  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you.  You've got to give them something, because that's a pretty funny line.  That's a funny line, but give them that one.  If you're going to try to, like, get to us, you've got to come up with something a little  bit more than that.  CBS have fun!  Hey!  Hello!  Look, they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony could be taken to vacation.  Hey, get some CBS music.  We'll do it how they did it, probably in between records, because they only get, like, 15 seconds  to do their shtick, Anthony, you know?  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like they do over there. 
[03:02:30]  I wish we had the echo.  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're, like, playing basketball in the gym and doing a radio  show at the same time?  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love!  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that.  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business.  All right, Ant, you want to be the CBS FM DJ?  What song is it?  Dissing us, Joy to the World.  Oh, yeah?  Guess that you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony. 
[03:03:00]  Okay, I'll try.  Hey, CBS FM!  It's Harry Balls here.  Oh, this is a short intro.  Yeah, we need a long intro.  We need a much longer intro than that, right?  I can't say who I am, the station, and rag us.  Yeah, we got to...  How about a little, uh...  Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM.  You know, I'm reading.  They cloned a couple of monkeys, and the music's coming in now.  We don't have enough time.  Okay, I got one.  We got one?  I don't know.  We got to have a long intro. 
[03:03:30]  No, no, really.  We need, like, 15 seconds.  Hey, everybody!  Harry Snatch with you, CBS FM.  I'm reading in the paper today that they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony are going to be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies!  Long, cool woman in a black dress.  This one taking you right back to September 1972.  Yeah, that's not bad, man.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble. 
[03:04:00]  All right, well, you want to do, like, a little, uh, weather break?  Do a quick, quick weather break.  You don't have much time here.  Ready?  Hey, Harry Snatch with you.  Gonna be a little cold today.  Make sure you put on your sweater, CBS FM.  Hey, girl, what you doing down?  Ho, ho!  You're gonna be freezing.  Your testicles are gonna be sticking to your ass crack.  I've lost my friggin' mind working here at CBS FM.  Ho, ho! 
[03:04:30]  How you doing, people?  Remember, it's really cold outside.  So, uh, put on a sweater, or you'll end up brain damage like Opie and Anthony.  Look, I'm talking over the music.  I'm gonna get fired.  Ha, ha!  Miss Taberain, man.  Miss Taberain, man.  I like the Shatner version better.  CBS FM.  Miss Taberain, man. 
[03:05:00]  All right, you're getting better as we go along here.  Ahem.  What the hell is this?  Ho, ho!  Gypsy Sluts and Whores on CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  I've gone in the wagon of a traveling show.  My mama used to dance.  That's all they get to say, though.  Like, that's pretty much the gig over there.  You just got to do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life in, like, three seconds.  Well, then she could be down.  You don't even get a chance there. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, that one, you know.  Here, try this one.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with you on CBS FM.  You know, they cloned a couple of monkeys, and I can't talk about it because the music started.  I wish I was over at Eddie W.  See, he had to...  They don't give a crap.  He had to pick the perfect song to do it.  Yeah.  I think this one would do it for you.  Here you go.  Hold on, man.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Snatch with you.  Coming up next, nine-year-old boys with no teeth.  Next on CBS FM. 
[03:06:00]  Oh!  Yeah, you hit the post there, my brother.  That was the one.  Very impressed with that one.  All right, wait.  Let's try this one.  Remember the Cher song?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Hey, everybody.  CBS FM.  I like doing oral on my dog.  It's the Cherokee people.  CBS.  It's the Cherokee people show. 
[03:06:30]  CBS FM.  Incense and peppermint.  Strawberry alarm clock.  I got my finger in my ass.  CBS.  CBS.  Oh, these boots are made for walking or sticking in my butt crack. 
[03:07:00]  That's the Sinatra CBS FM.  Jab.  You keep saying you've got something for me.  You never close your eyes.  You need more than life.  You need more than life.  You need more than life.  What a tool.  Keep talking about us.  We can care less.  That is a talent, though.  You've got to give them that.  Uno, dos.  One, two, tres, cuatro.  Ho, ho, everybody. 
[03:07:30]  Hairy snatch with ya.  Wooly, bully.  That's how I like my girls with a big hairy gash.  CBS FM.  Hey, everybody.  Dick, who's an in-ya?  We're going to be happy together with the turtles.  Uh-oh.  I screwed up again.  I think about your day and night.  So you're right to think about the good love. 
[03:08:00]  Hey, Dick, who's an in-ya here?  We're on CBS FM with a bump case.  Wow, that was an easy one.  And for someone else, but not for me.  Hey, cream and your snacks here.  On CBS FM, I like hairless 10-year-olds.  On CBS FM. 
[03:08:30]  What a freaking tool, man.  Ho, ho.  It's windy outside, isn't it?  At Pretty Cold.  Make sure you wear your sweater.  I like catching hummers.  I'm catching one right now under the console.  From Wendy, CBS.  I can get a job over there, right? 
[03:09:00]  I think you can, man.  As long as you can goof on stupid stuff.  You've just got to say inane crap in between all the crappy music.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Crotch with you.  And, uh...  Oh, jeez.  I was just looking at the name of the song. 
[03:09:30]  Well, it's a tricky job.  I keep stepping on the words because I'm diddling myself.  C-B-S.  That's some gig they got over there, though.  But if all you had to do is, like, during the music,  plan out what you're going to say over the...  And listen to the beginning of the song 20 times.  Hey, the Osmond Brothers! 
[03:10:00]  You know, I'd like to, uh...  I'd like to anally rape the youngest one.  CBS!  Holy smoke!  Wow.  I'm dying over here.  Oh, my God.  That was a good one. 
[03:10:30]  Too funny.  Hey, everyone.  Dick inside you here at CBS FM.  Remember the Namblin' Convention this weekend.  If you like the hairless little nutsacks.  CBS!  I don't even care if people aren't finding this funny, man.  We could do this for another five hours.  Hey, everyone. 
[03:11:00]  Saggy balls with you.  You know, ever since I passed 60, my sack is like melted Turkish taffy.  I gotta tell you, Agent Gravity, it's a bitch.  CBS FM.  You hit the post there pretty good.  I'll try.  I'll try.  I'll step down a little bit.  Okay. 
[03:11:30]  Hey, everyone.  It's your good pal, Phil McCracken.  Over here, CBS FM.  It's the association.  This one taking you way back.  Reminds me of the first time I had a man's unit in my face.  CBS!  CBS!  He went away, and you hung around.  Hey, shut up, bitch.  I gotta talk over you.  I wouldn't go out with you.  You said things that weren't very bad. 
[03:12:00]  My boyfriend's back, and you're gonna be in trouble.  Hey, line, hey, line.  My boyfriend's back.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, it's the Jackson 5, CBS FM.  That's when he was a black man, as opposed to when he is now a white woman.  You got the echo? 
[03:12:30]  I just hear static.  Hello, hello, hello.  No, it doesn't work that good.  Damn, I wish we had that.  Oh, there it is.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Wolf!  Wait a minute.  Very good.  Make it nice and loud for Andy.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, everyone.  Claude Balls here, CBS FM.  I'm here in a gymnasium, and I'm hoping to find a few underage girls to bang. 
[03:13:00]  CBS!  I can't even hear the music on this echo.  Yeah, you might remember this one.  Take you right back, 1976.  That was John Kiki D.  Don't go breaking my heart.  And I remember her yelling, don't go breaking my hymen. 
[03:13:30]  CBS!  Don't go breaking my heart.  I couldn't if I tried.  Oh, honey, if I could rest at my heart, maybe you're not...  Hey, Anthony, pass me the ball.  I want to take a couple shots as we're in this gymnasium doing a radio show.  All right, let's play a game of horse.  Okay.  What a joke.  It's CBS! 
[03:14:00]  Goddamn.  Hello, love.  Hello, love.  Ron Lundy.  Hello, love.  I am B.B.  Harry Harrison.  All right, ready for another one?  Where's my echo, goddammit?  Where's the echo for the man?  Yeah, this will take you back, 1972.  Three Dog Nights, black and white. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, that's how I like them.  Black.  Yeah.  I don't have anything funny to say to that, I don't think.  That's all right.  I need a good song about, like, effing.  Hey, do that one.  Track one, man.  That's a hit.  That's a CBS FM hit right there.  What, track one over there?  On this one.  All right, turn up Ant's echo again.  Here we go.  Where's my echo?  Echo.  Hey, is this a live cut? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  All right, everyone.  Elton John on CBS and many of the Jets.  You know, on this final of the King's birthday, I'd like to say, I think the Klan has some good ideas.  CBS FM.  Hey, kid.  Hey, kid.  Get off my head.  Okay.  Okay, hold on.  This one's good.  All right.  Hold on. 
[03:15:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, everyone.  Little Avon's The Locomotion.  This one coming out August 1962.  I'm Buster Hyman.  See me again.  Andy, what's up?  You guys are killing me.  I'm on 17, and me and a guy next to me who was obviously listening because he was laughing his ass off, too, 
[03:16:00]  almost hit each other on the highway.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  Take it easy.  All right, bye.  Here we go.  Hey, everyone.  It's Hey, Would You Blow Me here on CBS FM.  This one, Billy Preston going back to night season 74.  Nothing from nothing.  You know, I think Adolf Hitler was a good guy.  CBS.  Yeah.  Nothing from nothing.  He's got to have something if you want to be with me. 
[03:16:30]  Well, he's got to get his ideas in quick.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah.  What's up?  Do you guys think this actually is hysterical, huh?  Yes, we do.  You think this is really funny?  Yes.  Our caller, Frank, you're on the air.  This is really...  It's me, Justin Sider.  I don't think it's funny.  You know, CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing rock and roll to this city.  Oh, Frank. 
[03:17:00]  Looks like Hitler missed a few.  CBS.  It's not funny, man.  It's just not funny.  It's not funny.  You're saying it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not right, man.  It's just not right.  Is my echo coming through?  Because that's all that matters.  Hey, if your echo's coming through, you need a little bit more if you really want to know  the truth.  All right, Frank.  You know, ow.  What's the beef with that on the station?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  He doesn't understand it.  Why are you mocking on CBS FM? 
[03:17:30]  And dedicated to him, we'll play just a little understanding.  Take you right back to 1962, Frank.  We understand you.  We're listening here at CBS FM.  What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM?  CBS is to help enhance my voice so you can't tell them 101, just like our frequency.  101, CBS FM.  God damn. 
[03:18:00]  Ron Lundy, CBS FM.  How you doing, people?  This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films.  What is this, the thief, the SWAT?  I thought it was Shaft.  I could talk through the whole thing, because there's no words in this song.  So I could talk it up right to the end.  Hey, let's go touch some children. 
[03:18:30]  CBS.  CBS.  I bet Frank didn't like that one.  Frank that just called in didn't like it, because he's a child toucher.  CBS.  CBS.  Hey, Jizz, stay with you here on CBS FM. 
[03:19:00]  Reminded everyone, do a public service announcement, get those herpes vaccinations, because you don't  know who I'm going to be bagging.  Oh, CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  Hey, Frank Dildo here.  This one's going to be taking you all the way back to 1974's David Essex, Rock On. 
[03:19:30]  And boy, I got a rock-hard one here in my past.  Just thinking of passing by the junior high school earlier.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  Oh, yeah, here we go.  Partying like there's no tomorrow. 
[03:20:00]  It's Phil McCrackin' here at CBS FM.  This one, the chaps.  Tequila.  I like drinking a lot of tequila and sticking my member where it doesn't belong.  Maybe that's not about your own keister.  Oh, ho, ho.  Let's go out and sniff some young panties.  Come on with me.  CBS FM.  Yeah, Harry Sack here. 
[03:20:30]  It's Paul Anka.  Lonely boy.  I'm pretty lonely, too.  I'm just a lonely boy.  Uh-oh, I ran out of music there, Opie.  What would happen if that actually happened on CBS FM?  I just keep talking.  I'm so lonely, I got blue balls.  CBS.  I've got it.  Hey, it's wake up little Susie, the Emerald brothers.  I like them when they're asleep. 
[03:21:00]  I come back and they never know it.  It never ends.  Artie, you're next.  How you doing, guys?  Artie, you're on.  I hated those guys when I used to listen to them as a kid.  This is the funniest skit I have ever heard in my whole life.  We're going to get jobs over there at CBS FM.  You guys are much better than those clowns that used to be over there, I'll tell you. 
[03:21:30]  Hey, Bloody Anus here on CBS, and I want to remind everybody at the NAMLA convention this weekend,  don't forget, tight little supple buttocks.  Sponsored by us here at CBS FM.  Nine-year-old boys, not a hair on their sack.  What's up, Gio?  How you guys doing?  Good, what's up?  Make it fast.  Yeah, listen, I want to hear some Beach Boys.  Can you hook me up with some Beach Boys, please?  Yeah, let's find some Beach Boys.  Request going out.  Can Harry Sack hook me up with some Beach Boys, please? 
[03:22:00]  Harry Sack, Gio will hook you up with some Beach Boys.  All right, Harry, thanks, man.  We'll get to Gio's request in a second, but here's another one for everyone out there in Radio  Land.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, everybody.  Claude Balls here.  Frankie Avalon from 1959.  Venus rhymes with penis.  What I like having in my face.  CBS.  Venus.  Penis, if you will. 
[03:22:30]  We send a little girl for a native friend.  Yeah, I like the line of that song.  My kisses and my arms.  Everyone from 1958, the teddy bears, to know him is to love him, and to know me is to be  bleeding from the ab when you wake up.  CBS.  Well, now we're getting the requests coming in.  Listen, Bloody Anus, could you play a little Three Dog Night for me? 
[03:23:00]  Andrew wants to hear some Three Dog Night.  I remember I had a Three Dog Night once.  One on my face, another one I was banging, and the other one was licking me, you know  where.  CBS.  Yeah, this one.  Dave, baby, Cortez.  It's called The Happy Organ, this song.  I have a happy organ in my pants.  Just thinking.  Uh-oh, there it goes all over the console. 
[03:23:30]  CBS.  Just had an accident.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, Big Dick goes in you here.  It's the Crass 16 Candles.  Suck me, CBS.  It ever ends. 
[03:24:00]  Hey, Frank.  Guys, seriously, come on.  It's not funny anymore.  Maybe for the first five seconds it was funny.  No, we just drilled into the ground, dude.  You're pissing me off.  We just wanted to see how long it would take someone to call up and say, knock it off.  All right, thank you.  All right, Frank.  And for you?  Can I have a request?  Yeah, this one's going out to you, Frank. 
[03:24:30]  Okay.  For silhouettes, get a job, you loser, Frank.  Frank's a child-toucher, CBS.  It's not funny.  It's not funny, man.  Frank says it's not funny.  It's a loss.  It's pissing a loss, CBS.  He's laughing, CBS.  Frank's a homo, CBS. 
[03:25:00]  Come on.  We're just having fun.  Just can't make it stop.  One more.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  We've got to end up on an up note here.  All right, here we go.  Claude Balls here.  This one going back to 1961.  The lion sleeps tonight.  The tokens.  Lion wouldn't be sleeping if I were there.  I'm into bestiality.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  CBS FM. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, brother.  So, there you have it.  CBS FM.  They make fun of us with one lousy line, and we just did about an hour on them.  Yeah, thank you for giving us an hour of material.  Hi, everybody.  This is Huey Lewis reminding you that you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, guys, we're on vacation right now.  Ah, vacation.  That means you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony with our little friend, Jimmy  Norton.  Mm-hmm.  Right now, we're going to play a bit for you called the Edmund Fitz.  Remember, we were talking about Deadliest Catch, that TV show with a crab fisherman, and  we started talking about the Edmund Fitzgerald, a ship that went down, and got us playing  the song, and having a little fun with it.  This bit got a happy face from the crew. 
[03:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  Take a listen.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I got to tell you, though, one of the best reality shows on TV is that goddamn stupid  crab fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing.  What the hell was the crab fishing show?  The most dangerous catch on Discovery Channel.  Ever hear about this?  No.  They put cameras on a bunch of these ships that go out into the Bering Sea in Alaska.  I thought they put cameras on toilet seats.  No.  I was like, what are you talking about? 
[03:27:00]  Crab fishing.  Crab fishing.  They put them on all these crabbing boats, and they go out into the Bering Sea, there by  Alaska, and they go crabbing.  Now, you'd think, okay, how is that a TV show?  Apparently, this is like one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.  People die in all the time.  And it's a reality show, because they follow these people's lives and personalities and  their jobs.  And what we've all wanted to see on reality shows, people are dropping dead.  Really? 
[03:27:30]  People are dying.  They show the captain of some ship showing how to put on some emergency gear, and then  they're out on a boat, and one of the cameramen see the captain on the radio, and the ship  capsized, sunk.  The captain that was just doing the little thing on his gear, and six of his crewmen are  dead.  And another guy falls overboard.  He's dead.  People are getting injured all the time.  This is reality.  Why else would you watch a crab fishing show? 
[03:28:00]  I hope they bring up a bunch of crabs.  They've got to interview the crabs.  They have new deaths every week.  It's like a holocaust.  The crab holocaust.  Unbelievable.  But I got roped into watching this, and I'm watching it now all the time.  Most dangerous catch.  I never knew this show was on TV.  I sit there doing the Regan bit.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm not even fishing.  I'm watching fishing.  But is the crab show, it's just being filmed. 
[03:28:30]  There's no phony reality angle, right?  It's just really being filmed.  No, it's just these guys.  They're all a little kooky to be out there.  They work for, it's only a few days, a couple of times a year that they do this.  And they could walk away with upwards of 10, 15 grand each for just a few days' work.  But it's just the worst job ever.  There's no immunity challenge?  No, no challenges.  Actually, they do have a Budweiser-sponsored crab count with which ship brings in the most pounds of crab. 
[03:29:00]  They should have, like, a body count because people are dropping dead.  There was one ship just keeled over.  And they found out that they had too many of these crab traps on it.  And it was top-heavy, overloaded.  The captain, yeah, screwed up and paid with his life.  Was that, like, by Lake Ichiguni?  It was, like, going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere.  And there was a storm.  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Well, our crab pots were full and we came into shore. 
[03:29:30]  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  The song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  And the water was at my ankles and the song goes on another hour.  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about a boat that sank.  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  I looked at the fuel gauge.  It was three-quarters full.  And we motored on toward our destination. 
[03:30:00]  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Hey, we could kill seven minutes.  Let this play today.  I asked for my money back.  He said, drop dead, you horse-toothed.  You're getting nothing back.  The big, big, big, old get your goon.  Kitcha-goomy.  All right.  Oh.  The lake, it is said, never gives up for dead.  When the skies of November turn gloomy.  Gloomy.  Kitcha-goomy with gloomy. 
[03:30:30]  With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more.  Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.  I smelt bad from fish and put on perfumey.  That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed.  When the gales of November gave a early.  Did they cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern.  And I started the engine with a turn of the key.  Jesus.  Every friggin' step of the way.  The Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already. 
[03:31:00]  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135 and I turned the wheel and the purser got me my coffee.  I take it light and sweet, but he made it too dark and I sent them back to the galley.  All right.  What happened?  What happened next?  I went to sleep in my heart's sleep paralysis and I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed.  It was on forever. 
[03:31:30]  The wind and the wind and the wind and the tattletale sun and the waves were over the railing.  This song's only half over and I still see the dock.  The captain did do it with the witch of November and stealing.  I forgot my wallet in my car so we turned the ship around and we docked again and I figured I'd stop for a year.  When afternoon came, it was creasin' rain. 
[03:32:00]  Tune in and two hours later when the ship finally sinks.  Enough.  And then they're throwing a musical interlude to make it longer.  Christ.  I put on my life vest and helped my crew put it on too and we stood there and, well, the water's now up to our knees.  It's too rough to feed you. 
[03:32:30]  See, look.  All right, we'll just kind of.  It's still going.  We'll take a few phone calls and we'll go back to the song in a minute.  Scott in Arizona.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Pretty.  Ah, hey, I got.  Hey, don't get me wrong here.  You guys are great, man.  I mean, I love the shit out of you guys.  I got a little complaint about the crabbing thing.  I spent 15 years up in Alaska commercial fishing and then I just got in my big truck this morning and, boom, first thing I turned you guys on this morning, you guys were complaining about the show. 
[03:33:00]  What?  Yeah.  Who's complaining?  Oh, you said you didn't like it and then you're making fun of a bunch of fish.  I love the crab show.  That's what I was saying.  Were you listening or were you like me?  He liked it.  I'm not listening.  You better listen to the replay.  Listen to the replay.  I love the crab show.  I said I can't stop watching it.  Oh, I apologize.  My brain fart.  My thing was I was saying that all crabbers are bums and incompetents.  Anthony was disagreeing.  Well, I have to agree with you there. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to move on.  Tad again from San Francisco.  I watched the History Channel show on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  It took three minutes for the boat to sink, so it takes longer for the song to play than it took for the boat to actually sink.  Well, let's see where the song is.  All right.  Where are we?  Weared in.  He had water coming in.  And the good shipping crew was in peril.  All right.  It's still starting to sink.  Well, we'll go back to the song in a little while and see what happens.  Let's take a couple of minutes.  I said, hey, dude, what do you think about this?  He said, I don't know.  There might be a hole in the boat. 
[03:34:00]  So we went down to the engine room, and yeah, there was a hole, and we sat and smoked a cigarette or two because it really wasn't that bad.  Let's say hi to Alex in Boston.  Alex?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got two points.  Jimmy, don't you play the most dangerous catch every night?  That's not bad.  Not bad.  Jimmy tangling with some tainted vagina.  It's me on a boat with three Craigslist prostitutes.  And crabs are involved also.  Very nice.  And Rick Ross buys a car like people buy drugs. 
[03:34:30]  Give him the money first, wait, and he'll come back with a car.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  You should have started with that one.  Speaking of cars.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's go back to the song and see where Gordon Lightfoot is at.  Uh-oh.  Take us down.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll check back.  He's still in that musical interlude there.  Who's that other ballad singer? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  He's like...  With the Captain Wyatt and the water coming in.  Steve Flamefoot.  Oh, 27,000 times more than the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Jesus.  He separated the tea and the tea.  We have a little problem.  The striples, they won't take their clothes off.  Striples?  Yes.  Striples.  Yes.  They're kind of like an Australian children's naked singing group. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  Before we go to break, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is here.  All right.  He's still going?  Music.  Music.  Does anyone know where the love of God goes when the waves turn the minutes to hours?  Minutes to hours.  The searchers all say they have made white fish pay if they put 15 more miles behind her. 
[03:36:00]  Huh?  They might have split up or they might have capsized.  They may have broke deep and took water.  And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.  All right.  We'll go back to Gordon Lightfoot after the break.  He's still singing along.  Now he's singing about the survivors and everything.  The wife remarried and had three kids and can't even remember his name. 
[03:36:30]  Been 15 years and now I'm going to sing about his children's experience in elementary school.  That's a bit of a long tune.  Oh, Christ.  I think we were making that point, Jimmy.  Oh, that's true.  I just jump in like, hey, guys, I have a thought.  That's a long song.  Long song.  Gordon, you've come.  Gordon Lightfoot. 
[03:37:00]  Heavy on the pen, though.  And my typewriter ran out of Vink.  Yeah.  He doesn't get to the end of it.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing, Chicken Lips?  That's very mean-spirited.  What?  What?  What's painful?  What?  That fucking song, that Gordon Lightfoot song. 
[03:37:30]  You don't like that song?  No, dude.  It's fucking horrible.  It's not horrible.  Oh, it's terrible.  What do you prefer?  What kind of song do you prefer?  If I could just jump in and make a relative comparison?  Anything but that.  That's a little vague, sir.  I'll listen to Brother Joe's Journey covers.  You know?  All right.  I just don't do it.  This is all I had to say.  First of all, Loverboy did not do that fucking song with the outfield, that I Want to Lose Your  Love Tonight.  Oh, yeah.  It was the outfield.  Very good.  And Night Ranger's other song was Don't Tell Me You Love Me.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, that was a huge hit.  Yeah, I remember that one.  There you go.  Thank you, Chris.  Very informative.  You don't like Gordon Lightfoot, but you know Night Ranger and Loverboy songs from 1981.  Yeah, well, come on, dude.  1981, I was around, man.  Like, I wasn't around in whatever the hell.  When did that song come out, that Gordon Lightfoot?  I'm guessing in the mid-'70s, probably after the actual accident.  All right.  Yeah, my parents were eating granola, and I wasn't born yet, Joe.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, guys.  We've got to get back to Gordon Lightfoot, where is he at in this stupid song of his? 
[03:38:30]  Lake Huron Rolls, superior scenes, in the rooms of her ice-water mansion.  Oh, Michigan steams like a young man's dreams.  The islands and days are for sportsmen.  Then the sun's supernova, then the earth was burned to a crisp.  And it's 50 billion years in the future.  It's in what Lake Erie can send her.  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  We're Mylar suits, and we colonize Mars. 
[03:39:00]  And Danley, Danny finally got a sign on the TV show.  God, did I fuck that one up?  And Danley finally got a sign on the TV show.  I wouldn't hurt you, Danley.  I love every goddamn half a sign on your head.  And when should we take Danley to see a doctor?  As soon as possible!  I'm an elsehole.  Danley.  Oh, that's funny. 
[03:39:30]  Devin from New Hampshire.  Andrea Yates played that song as she drowned her kids.  And the next one looked up and said, hey, what's going on here, Mom?  When the bubble stopped, four more to go.  And the workers all...  Shit.  And the searchers all say they'd have made 21 if this bitch had taken her medicine. 
[03:40:00]  Five little unopened boxes under the tree.  Well, speaking of Gorn life, let's...  And two disappointed grandparents.  Let's see where Gorn is in the song.  As I set off to sail from Modesto.  A splash and a tear as my wife disappeared. 
[03:40:30]  Neat the blue briny waters of Modesto.  Are we finally at the end?  I don't know.  No.  Oh.  Is that it?  It must be all howling Detroit.  They prayed in the Maryland Sailor's Cathedral.  Oh, she's at Pregan now.  The church bell chimes if it rang 29 times. 
[03:41:00]  Five times.  For each man on the end is this cherub.  The legend lifts on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they call...  Down to the back end, man.  All right, we'll get back to Gorn Lifefoot.  I just want to hear the line where he says,  a grandmother's wasted charm bracelet.  As Grandma sadly looks at the bottle of Johnson's baby shampoo. 
[03:41:30]  Unceremoniously dumps it in the toilet.  Because it's useless.  And the quack of a rubber ducky in the trash pail.  What is wrong with you?  You are the worst.  You're the worst.  You're the worst.  Holy Jesus. 
[03:42:00]  That is hysterically awful.  Oh, my chest.  We'll see if we can get to the end of this.  Susan Smith sent the van down the boat ramp.  Two little tykes in their car seat.  She said, you little cock blockers, it's been nice to know you. 
[03:42:30]  And the big one said, mommy, why is we going backwards?  And she went on the news and pointed that Coco had taken her children.  Speaking of the song, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, there it is, fading out.  Wow, finally, we made it to the end.  Thank God, I got tears coming down my cheeks. 
[03:43:30]  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too.  Here comes the world's on this jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects and a few lines that don't make no sense and  open it, you'll be so proud of me.  Thank God.  I've missed the fight completely. 
[03:44:00]  I should kill myself discreetly.  This jingle is about my skills, I know.  My life's been kind of rough and 18 years is long enough.  My dad should have hopped the gun away.  Yay!  I got nothing.  10-202, the O.B. and Anthony show.  Yeah?  Hello, is Phil there? 
[03:44:30]  Phil is not working today.  No, Phil, I'm supposed to.  I'm supposed to get a call from Phil.  His last name is Lacio.  Who's this?  It's Spock, Marino.  Well, Phil doesn't work today.  No, not the one that works here, not a Phil.  Oh, what's his name?  Lucio.  Phil Lucio.  Phil Lucio.  Phil.  Phil. 
[03:45:00]  No, he's not here.  What?  He's not here.  How about Connie?  Is Connie there?  Connie who?  Connie.  Connie.  A girl, Connie.  No, a girl can come in this bar.  We have no room here.  What number did you want?  This is the two bar.  Yeah, but there's no women in here.  Who is this?  No women come in here.  I'm sorry.  The two bar.  It is the two bar, but no women come in here.  Oh, Fred?  Yeah. 
[03:45:30]  Why don't you come over here, son of a bitch, you motherfucker.  Why don't you go out and fuck your mother, you cocksucker?  Come on over here.  Come on over, dog.  Give me your way, person to person.  Why don't you come over here, you fucking bum?  You're too yellow.  I'll cut your balls off.  Hello?  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  Uh, just a two bar?  Yeah.  Can I speak to Ben, please?  Anybody named Ben?  Ben?  Ben?  Anybody named Ben?  Nobody, Ben.  His last name is, he's telling you how it's, uh, Dee Banana.  Who?  Dee Banana.  Dee Banana.  Dee Banana!  Dee Banana!  Dee Banana!  Nobody by that thing. 
[03:46:30]  Ben, Dee Banana, no?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello?  Oh, oh, is Jim that?  Who?  Jim.  Jim who?  Jim.  Who do you want to talk to?  Jim.  Jim who?  Nazium.  Who?  Nazium.  Jim Nadia.  Jim Nadia.  Jim Nadia.  How are you?  You sure?  Positive. 
[03:47:00]  Okay, thank you.  Hey, this is Joe Perry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM 202, the Opie and Anthony show.  How about this?  This is what I do now.  Yeah.  We're going to do a nice generic thing right now.  How about we talk about gravity?  Here it says here, a heated discussion between Jimmy and Anthony over the exact definition  of gravity.  It wasn't a heated discussion.  It wasn't heated.  We weren't angry.  I didn't say, uh, gravity is made by mass, fuck face. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  That explanation is so sociopathic, I don't know how to respond.  It wasn't heated.  We just did, I was wrong.  Ant was right.  Well, we don't know that yet.  Well, yeah, we do.  Just by the nature of saying me and Anthony discussed something.  Oh.  Oh.  We get to find out who was right and who was wrong about 20 minutes from the starting  time of this bit.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So I forget I said that.  Exactly.  Like in court.  Disregard that remark.  Exactly.  Spinning.  What an asshole I am. 
[03:48:00]  I'm so glad that Eric is picking out the stellar Opie and Anthony bit.  Yeah, what are you doing, Hawk?  I remember this one.  I was asleep on the counter for 20 minutes.  No, this is a good one.  This is heated.  Oh, yeah.  You just listened to how good this was.  This was hot talk.  People love it.  Spinning.  No spinning.  Who the heck knows?  They're stonking.  No.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  It's smoothie time. 
[03:48:30]  Get me that kind of smoothie and get me a turkey on wheat with a little provolone and some  deli mustard and a Diet Coke.  And get yourself a burger.  Jesus.  Get yourself a burger.  Look at this kid.  Yeah.  He weighs what?  How much do you weigh?  This is Travis, the go-getter. 
[03:49:00]  I weigh about 125, 130.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That's how much Christian Bale weighed in The Machinist.  How tall are you?  5'7", 5'8".  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a healthy height-to-weight ratio if you live on Neptune.  Hey, listen.  Are you, uh, you got my order correctly?  I want a little pretzels, too.  You want some?  Oh, nice pretzels?  A little bit of pretzels.  Diet Coke.  I want the same type of smoothie that fucking, uh, well, you know what kind of lover he is  is getting.  And I want, I want a turkey on, uh, rye with some fucking little bit of provolone and 
[03:49:30]  some cherry mustard.  His body frame would be, uh, more so found on, uh, on a planet with lighter gravity.  I know.  I couldn't think of Neptune.  Probably like Venus or, or, yeah, not, not, uh, Neptune, which has a lot of gravity.  A very strong gravitational pull would be more, a short, uh, heavier, uh, life form would  be found on, uh, Neptune.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you, Anthony, for clearing that up.  And don't think as soon as I...  It made sense to me.  I was like, yeah.  As soon as I said it, I knew I went farther away than I should have.  I should have.  I should have went closer to the sun.  But, you know, good thing that you and maybe one listener picked it up.  Right.  Hey, I'm pausing you.  All right, that's the body.  I'm pausing you.  Okay, uh, someone's going to challenge your theory, Anthony.  Let's go to John in Virginia.  I know.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Not mine.  It's Jimmy's, uh, uh, thing that he's challenging. 
[03:50:30]  I was gonna, but I didn't want to be, uh.  What theory?  I'll kill everybody.  That, the further away from the sun you get, the more gravity on the planets.  No, no, no, no.  That's not true.  No, I know.  I just meant I should have went to Venus or, uh, or Mercury.  No, no, it's the size of the planet.  Like Jupiter, you'd weigh like 900 pounds if you were 200.  The mass of the planet, my friend.  The mass.  Not the size.  Not the distance to the sun.  But also the rotational, uh, spin, because Jupiter has a 10-hour day, so it rotates over  almost two and a half times per hour, 24, which is why you're crushed. 
[03:51:00]  10-hour day.  10-hour day, yes.  10-hour day on Jupiter.  Spin in 10 hours.  That's why the entire planet spins around.  In 10 hours.  One revolution in 10 hours.  That's why it is such a crushing gravity.  It's the size of the planet versus the distance from the sun.  Say size of the planet again, and I'm gonna throw hot coffee on you.  It's got, you're right about size of the planet, but it's also the rate at which it's spinning.  And you could take that to the bank.  I'm not sure about that.  Jupiter, 10-hour day. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, I understand, but I think the gravity is the gravity regardless of how fast the planet's  spinning.  I'm not sure if you're getting, you're talking like centrifugal force kind of pulling you  off the planet and gravity pulling you back, kind of canceling each other out.  Well, what else determines, like, how much, like, you weigh 200 pounds here, you weigh  900 pounds on Jupiter.  What else would determine that?  I mean, size of the planet.  Absolutely.  Mass of the planet is, the more mass you have, the more gravity you have. 
[03:52:00]  That's it.  But doesn't that, that also has to count in the speed, because mass going at, like,  a slow speed is different than mass going at a fast speed.  I would think, if you take a scale, and you put it on something that's spinning, and then  put a weight on it, if you spin it faster, isn't the thing that you put on the scale going  to want to fly off more, thus making it lighter or seem lighter on the scale?  Maybe the way you're saying it, yeah, but I know on Jupiter, you're a lot heavier and 
[03:52:30]  it's spinning a lot faster.  I think all those things come into play, I just, I don't know enough about it.  I think spinning faster would make you lighter.  Spinning faster would want to, to propel your mass off the planet's surface, which would  then take your weight off that scale.  The density and mass of the planet is then pulling you back, which is gravity, and that  is only the mass of the planet.  That has nothing to do with the spinning.  The spinning might make you lighter, and I'm not sure of this, I'm just speculating, that 
[03:53:00]  it would try to throw you off the planet.  But then again, you'd have to be heavier to stay on it than if you're spinning faster.  In order to prevent being thrown off, you'd have to be heavier.  Again, that's the mass.  The planet would have to be spinning like a whirling dervish to fling you off of it.  I'm not saying you'd actually fling off of the planet, but there would probably be some  kind of, you know, if the Earth stopped spinning, you know, we'd all croak, but for that short  time, would you weigh less or more? 
[03:53:30]  I think you'd weigh more because you're canceling out the centrifugal force that would try to  throw you off the planet.  No, wait, that doesn't make sense because then you'd weigh more on the North Pole than  you would on the equator.  And I don't think you do.  Yeah, okay, spinning does nothing.  Thank you, Jim.  I've just solved my own problem.  You'd weigh more on the North Pole because you have no centrifugal force on the North Pole.  When's lunch?  Because I want to go out back and smoke pot with my friends.  I'm trying to figure this out on the air.  I'm sorry I'm working through this. 
[03:54:00]  I think it might be a combination because I know Jupiter spins extraordinarily.  The crushing gravity is from the speed of spinning and the mass.  I think it's a combination.  No, the gravity has nothing to do with the spinning.  Sure it does.  Nothing.  The gravitational pull?  Nothing.  I think it has something to do with the spinning.  Absolutely not.  I am saying now nothing with the spinning.  I will research this.  That's what keeps us on the planet is the spinning.  No.  The spinning causes gravity.  Gravity.  No, it's the mass.  The planet's mass itself makes gravity.  But if the planet wasn't spinning, there'd be no gravity. 
[03:54:30]  You'd be floating off it.  No.  No.  Just a big planet.  Wait.  You're agreeing?  Nathaniel is agreeing with me and Derek is agreeing with Jimmy.  You know, I'm right.  Spinning causes gravity.  No, it doesn't.  Sure it does.  Mass causes gravity.  But mass has to turn.  Say you just take a big planet and you put it in space with no movement, everything is  going to float off it.  Well, I think that's why you would probably float off the moon because maybe, I don't know  if it spins or not.  It does spin.  Maybe it doesn't spin fast enough to keep you. 
[03:55:00]  It spins at the exact same time.  Maybe it doesn't spin fast enough to keep you or maybe it's the lack of atmosphere.  There is gravity on...  But just not enough.  Here's a planet that doesn't spin.  Mars does not spin.  Okay.  And Mars has gravity because it has mass.  It has less mass so you don't have as much, you don't weigh as much on Mars as you would  on Earth.  But...  But it doesn't spin.  Then there's got to be some other factor that comes into play as well.  But I know spinning has something to do with gravity.  No.  Sorry.  Or rotation.  I am not agreeing with you, Jimmy.  I know, but somebody will call it.  Who knows? 
[03:55:30]  I think it's a combination.  Actually, the spinning, the only thing I can think of is the spinning probably stabilizes  the central mass, especially on Earth, which is just molten.  It stabilizes it where it would stabilize the gravity, but doesn't make the gravity.  Yes?  I've just been waiting here.  It's quite simple.  When a mass is present in the above space, you're not going to be...  Oh, but look at me when you're saying this.  I want to feel connected.  Eye-to-eye contact. 
[03:56:00]  Explain to me.  Don't look often.  I want to be explained, too.  Guys, it's quite simple.  When a mass is present in the above space-time, it distorts it so that...  Whilst it remains true that traveling through space causes you to travel through time...  What?  Whilst...  Whilst...  Whilst...  Whilst...  Travel through time.  Traveling through time now causes you to move, or you might want to say accelerate, Anthony,  through space.  In other words, just by existing, you are compelled to move through space. 
[03:56:30]  This, my friends, is gravity.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Of course it doesn't.  It's apples and oranges.  It's space-time.  It's planets.  It's planets and moons.  Let's keep it in the right areas.  I say gravity is based sheerly on the mass of a planet.  Combined with the spinning, with the rotation.  And nothing to do with spinning.  What do you think keeps all of our planets rotating around the sun?  The fact the sun spins is what keeps us all... 
[03:57:00]  No, it is the gravity of the huge mass of the sun.  The sun is huge.  The mass of the sun is huge.  Its gravity is huge.  It has sucked up the planets and then has them rotating around it because of its gravitational  field.  And the spin.  It has to rotate.  It has nothing to do with its spin.  I could understand the spin stabilizing a mass, keeping it in one spot, stabilizing the rotation  around the sun. 
[03:57:30]  Everything spinning, stabilized, just like a bullet rotating out of the barrel of a gun.  Keeps it straight.  That would keep it stabilized.  But it has nothing to do with...  If there's a mass large enough, whether it's spinning, moving, or standing still, if it's  mass, it will have gravity.  How does mass have gravity, though?  How does it happen?  It just...  That's just something that is.  It's a law of life and law of nature as we know it.  If something has mass, it has gravity.  Just something big draws something smaller to it. 
[03:58:00]  Something...  Yes.  Something with mass will have gravity.  It will have an attraction.  I wish someone out there knows the answer.  Anthony?  Just call him a fuckface.  Just get it over with.  No.  Fuckface.  Because I think that's a sociopathic argument to say that mass is just mass.  Mass makes gravity.  Combined with...  Spinning is stabilizing.  No, no.  Spinning!  Jimmy, there isn't spinning.  Go to your outfield and spin.  No.  And have your coach call you a ballerina.  I just did the...  Jimmy, what are you, a physicist? 
[03:58:30]  We'd get the answer, but...  Jimmy starts spinning.  All his playmates go flying towards him because he's all of a sudden got gravity.  No.  That'd be Bob Kelly in the outfield because he's got mass.  We would have got the answer to this, but Carl Sagan's been outside the studio for three  hours waiting to come in here.  Why do you make him wait?  If we didn't make him wait, we would have got the answer to this hours ago.  I will do the research.  Can someone call?  Do we have...  All right, we got a few calls.  Let's go to Earth.  I see we have a few calls.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Go ahead, Eric. 
[03:59:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  I can tell this real quick.  Jupiter and Neptune are both out of planets, so they actually don't have an actual surface.  They're both gaseous planets, so you can't even stand on either one of those planets.  But if you want to stand on one of the Jupiter moons, there's one that's actually larger  than Earth.  That would have more gravity.  So Anthony is right.  The larger the planet is based on the mass, that gives it a more gravitational pull.  It has nothing to do with the spin.  But are you saying that spinning has nothing to do with the creation of gravity? 
[03:59:30]  No, that's more of a...  What is it?  Almost like a centrifuge.  It just keeps everything together, but the mass, the size of it is what keeps everything  so you get more gravity based on the mass of it, not really the spinning.  I don't say that the size doesn't go into the amount of gravity, but I'm saying that  I think that rotating has something to do with the creation of gravity or the distance  of gravity.  I would say it has nothing to do with it.  And Eric, what is your background that you know this?  I actually just took my astronomy final about half an hour ago.  For college?  Astronomy final.  Yeah, at Kingsborough in Brooklyn. 
[04:00:00]  There you go.  We have an expert, Anthony.  High quality college education there.  All right, let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, go ahead.  Yeah, when they sit...  Up and everything.  What?  Matt.  It creates...  So they feel more like they're on Earth.  Really?  You're...  You're...  Wait, what?  Go ahead, Matt.  Try again.  I think I actually know what he's saying.  They have to spin...  In certain space station prototypes and stuff, they have a space station that spins. 
[04:00:30]  And the spinning space station makes artificial gravity.  But what that's using is centrifugal force.  What they would do is build the floor where you'd see the walls of the ship, of the station.  So when you spin it at a certain speed, you'll actually fly against it like a carnival ride.  That carnival ride where you would stick to the wall.  But instead of laying on the wall, you're actually walking on it.  And that's how you make it.  Like Moonraker.  Let me... 
[04:01:00]  The movie Moonraker.  If you remember...  Or 2001 A Space Odyssey is another one.  They show the space station.  And in that case, spinning makes gravity, but it's a whole different concept.  Right.  You're saying it's centrifugal force, not actually...  It's a simulation of gravity, but not real gravity.  Yeah, but not real gravity.  Maybe you are right, but I don't think you are.  I still think that spinning has something to do with gravity.  Why is Steven here?  Oh, Steve?  No, no.  Steve's mass is actually making gravity.  Exactly.  He's such a huge bear.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly the point I was going to make.  Fly towards him.  If mass strictly...  If mass... 
[04:01:30]  Did you determine...  Oh, no, you didn't.  If mass determines gravity and solely mass, how come larger people don't walk around with smaller  people stuck to them?  All right.  Good point, Hack.  I really...  That wasn't even a joke.  That was...  Yes, it was.  It was an attempt at a joke.  You're right.  An attempt.  It wasn't a joke, though.  That's correct, Ron.  I was very serious.  Of course, something...  In order to have gravity needs huge amounts of mass.  You need huge mass.  Ramon, bring me Stephen Hawking. 
[04:02:00]  Gravity is based solely on mass.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people are saying that.  Let's go to Vinny and...  Yes, Vinny.  Vinny.  Hey, Opie.  Anthony.  Daddy.  All right.  Daddy.  Daddy.  My things are daddy.  Jesus.  Hey, one thing you guys are forgetting is if you take a planet twice the size of Earth  and you spin it three times as fast, is Anthony's periwinkle shirt still gay?  Uh, let me calculate.  I'm punching those figures in now as we speak. 
[04:02:30]  And, yes, it's coming up full fag.  Well, that's got a gravitational theory, too.  It's like the more periwinkle your shirt is, the more likely your mouth is to be drawn  to a cock.  And we let that drop today.  Wait, did anybody...  Now, is anybody saying I'm right at all?  I...  I don't think so.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  If everybody's saying I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.  Jason is saying equally important, which I think he's trying to say that it's both spinning  and mass, but I don't buy that. 
[04:03:00]  I don't think it's...  I don't know what the ratio of importance is.  I just think that it certainly has something to do with rotation.  I'm not saying...  Maybe centrifugal force is a part of gravity.  But centrifugal force would only make you lighter.  With that theory that the spinning has something to do with gravity, spinning on the outside  of the planet...  Say you're standing on the equator.  The Earth is spinning.  Wouldn't it then tend to throw you off the planet, which would make you lighter, which  is against gravity?  That's the opposite of gravity.  I don't know in a space situation where it's a vacuum. 
[04:03:30]  I don't know.  Like, I'm talking on Earth.  I'm talking here on Earth.  You're on the equator.  Where it's spinning, as opposed to being on the North Pole, which is...  You would get no centrifugal force, because you're...  You know, the North Pole is the pivot point.  Right.  So you're standing there on the North Pole.  With your theory, you would weigh more on the North Pole than you would on the equator.  Or actually, you would say you would weigh more on the equator, because you're saying  the spinning makes gravity.  I'm saying it's a part of gravity. 
[04:04:00]  And plus, even if you're not in that right location, I think the whole planet has the  amount of...  The same amount of gravity.  Yeah, that's just it.  It does, regardless of the spin.  You're getting a full spin on the equator.  You're getting the full, like, centrifugal force spin standing on the equator.  You're getting none of it on the North Pole, yet you weigh exactly the same standing on  the equator or the North Pole.  I still think...  I mean, I can't argue that point, because you sound like you're right.  Because I sound like I'm right.  It does sound right.  Anthony, Isaac Newton was the first scientist to define gravity mathematically when he formulated 
[04:04:30]  his law of universal gravitation.  Right.  Okay.  The law of gravitation says that gravity is strongest between two very massive objects  and gets much weaker as these objects get further apart.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mass.  But it has something to do with the distance, the relationship, how far away you are from  them.  He doesn't say...  Well, yeah.  The gravity gets less the further away you get.  That's why, you know, when spaceships leave the Earth's orbit, the further away they get... 
[04:05:00]  But what causes the gravity?  Mass.  But he didn't say that Isaac Newton is not saying that's what causes gravity.  No, he's not saying what causes it.  He's not saying what causes gravity.  What makes gravity is the mass.  It's mass.  Or the importance of a situation.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's the gravity of this situation?  Back in high school from those, you know, the films that they made to watch in physics  class, when you see the solar system start to come together, then everything's always  spinning.  So, like, the spinning kind of helps to bring all that mass together, which is what makes 
[04:05:30]  the gravity, you know?  Like, it's not...  Either the spinning helps to bring all those atoms and everything together over millions  of years to make those massive planets and suns and all that stuff.  The spinning is a part of the planets and the way they move and react to each other's  gravity.  Right.  And it helps to bring that all together.  But it doesn't make the gravity.  No.  The rotation, the speed, everything is how it all wraps up and affects each other's 
[04:06:00]  gravity.  Every planet in the solar system affects the other one based on its gravity, its rotation,  the sun.  But it doesn't cause the gravity.  Right.  The gravity is caused by the mass.  The rotation helps to make the orbits.  You know, because, like, you have the sun sitting...  When gravity affects the fabric of space-time and the sun is sitting in the center of it  and all the planets are around it in the big bowl...  You've got to watch Brian Greene on Nobody's really good.  The big bowl and then it spins around it. 
[04:06:30]  And the spinning of the planets is what, you know, makes the revolutions possible.  Yeah, because if you just have an object, a giant object...  Well, that would have a lot of gravity.  A giant object makes gravity.  So things are going to be drawn to it.  A magnetic force is what keeps us from getting sucked into the center of the Earth.  Shut up.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  It doesn't make sense just to have a large object is going to have...  I know it doesn't make sense, but it's true.  It makes no sense whatsoever that just because something's large gives it this magnetic pull. 
[04:07:00]  But that's just the way it is.  That's so, so...  Yeah.  I don't even know if I know how to respond to that.  If you take a copper and wrap it up and spin it around magnets, it makes electricity.  They don't even know why.  They're not even really sure why a generator works.  But it just happens that's what makes it work.  There's no explaining it.  It's just like mass.  For some reason, when something's giant, things get pulled towards it. 
[04:07:30]  As opposed to in a singles bar where it's exactly the opposite.  The bigger it is, the more you shun it.  That would be wild.  Sometimes when I'm looking for paperclips or things, they're all attached to the front of Ben's pants.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Can we look up the definition of gravity?  Yeah.  Why haven't we just gotten that?  You guys, uh...  I'll work on that tonight.  I'll put together a whole report.  You realize that this started because you wanted smoothies, right?  Wow.  Really?  Smoothies.  How did the smoothie turn into that argument? 
[04:08:00]  I don't know.  Because then Travis was thin, looking...  Oh, right.  Because Travis is thin, looking like he grew up on Neptune.  That's why you always got to bear with us on this program.  You never know what's going to happen.  You never know what turn we're going to take.  People are sending me links to all kinds of definitions on this, and every link I've checked doesn't work.  You're just wonderfully retarded people.  How about this?  You go to dictionary.com and look up gravity and just see what it says.  Yeah.  Let's go to Dave in Florida.  Dave? 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  To shoot down Jim's theory, if the rotation, the space shuttle's in orbit, yet they have no gravity.  What?  The space shuttle.  It's going as fast as the Earth spins around, yet there's no gravity on the space shuttle when it's in outer space.  Well, isn't that an atmosphere thing, too?  Because once you leave the Earth's atmosphere, oh, that's the gravitational pull you're leaving.  Oh, the atmosphere.  That's correct.  Jimmy, the atmosphere has nothing to do with gravity, either.  No, no, no, no, no, but I'm saying it's like once you leave the atmosphere, that's how far the Earth's gravitational pull seems to go. 
[04:09:00]  Oh, no, it goes far.  No, it goes really far.  It goes to, you know.  But isn't the challenge, isn't the space shuttle being held to the Earth in that rotation by the Earth's gravity?  Yeah.  Well, it has a lot to do with escape velocity, too.  Oh, escape velocity.  Yeah, I know.  I was going to say that yesterday.  Yeah.  25,000 miles per hour, by the way.  That didn't shoot my, what, the Earth?  No, escape velocity.  Escape velocity.  You plan on going to the moon.  So if you throw a baseball that fast, it'll never come, hit the ground?  It'll leave Earth's orbit. 
[04:09:30]  It'll probably be eaten up by the atmosphere.  Guys, can we go back to talking about tits?  Sure.  I want a clear-cut definition of gravity.  Tits and their reaction to gravity.  Gravity is the enemy of the tit, Opie.  You've noticed.  Gravity and time, really the enemy of the tit.  And I don't think we'll get any argument from that.  Uh, no.  Walk, how about a definition?  Oh, we got it?  Or, Opie, can you just think of one? 
[04:10:00]  Please, give him the mic.  I've just been waiting for you guys to ask me that.  Oh, finally.  Oh, my God.  When it comes to physics, Anthony,  the natural force of attraction exerted by a celestial body such as Earth  upon objects at or near its surface,  tending to draw them toward the center of the body.  It does say nothing about spin.  Gravity is the brute mass, man.  All right.  Oh, I know I'm right.  Yeah, I think you are. 
[04:10:30]  Should we take a break?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Should we take a break?  No.  The force of attraction between all masses in the universe.  Yeah, I guess.  All masses, regardless of them spinning or not.  Well, it's kind of like what I was saying.  Because I did acknowledge that.  Jimmy, you're never too old to learn something new.  Don't take this as something bad.  This is a good thing.  You're learning.  It's not a good thing.  You're learning.  What I'm learning is I kind of, like, should have shut my face immediately  and played it like, well, I'm not too sure. 
[04:11:00]  But instead I took the argument.  God damn it.  If it wasn't for spin, we'd all be floating.  Spinning sucks my dick and it wrecks everything.  All right, we'll take one more because it's always fun to take a call from Alabama.  All right, Alabama.  Les, what's up?  Yeah, answer to your rotation gravity deal.  Yeah, deal.  It's the core that causes the gravity.  The rotation of the core is what causes the gravity. 
[04:11:30]  The rotation of the core of the sun is what causes gravity to the sun.  The core of the earth spins rotation and it causes gravity in the earth.  So the mass of the core is what causes gravity.  Where did you hear this, sir?  I watch National Indographic and I watch them nature shows and those old things.  Yeah, I hear you.  So you're saying that while it is a mass that has gravity, now he's listening to himself. 
[04:12:00]  So he's saying that the core of the mass is what causes the gravity in the mass.  My beloved core!  It's what causes the gravitational pull.  So Anthony's right when he says that the mass has it, but you're saying it's the rotation of the core.  It's the rotation of the mass in the core.  That causes the mass to have it.  I will not buy this man's explanation because there are massive bodies in space that have gravity and no core whatsoever.  What about giant meteors in the meteor belt that are just hunks of iron and they have gravity? 
[04:12:30]  In the meteor belt, they're held there by the...  I'm not talking about what they're held there by, but they themselves, if they're big enough and have enough mass, they have gravity.  They're spinning.  But they have a core.  They have a core.  No, they don't.  They're just huge chunks of iron.  But then again, wait a minute.  The Earth has an independent core that's rotating.  Have you ever watched The Journey to the Center of the Earth?  He's getting his info from Journey to the Center of the Earth. 
[04:13:00]  The only thing I will say, though, is when you look at something like a neutron star, shut up.  The Journey to the Center of the Earth, when they dropped all them bombs to restart the core of the Earth?  Right.  When they restarted the core of the Earth, remember at the beginning of the movie, they had all kinds of bad storms, and they had the problem with the gravitational pull.  When they restarted the core of the Earth.  And then there's a giant lizard?  There's a giant lizard there? 
[04:13:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the newest version.  What about...  What about when they shot that spaceship into the person's body, when they made it real teeny tiny, and they had to go through his heart, and then the blood cells was trying to eat him like they were so much vittles?  No, it is the core.  It is the rotation of the core that causes the gravity.  All right.  Thank you, Les.  Thank you.  My only thing is... 
[04:14:00]  Physics with Larry the Cable Guy.  One of the things I have...  Now, this might be a mass thing, but when a star collapses on itself and becomes a black hole, what sucks things into it is the intense gravity, and that is...  I know there's a tremendous spin there, which brings things in.  That's why I'm thinking...  Yeah, but it's just the mass.  But is there anything else?  It's the mass in such a small area.  If you take the mass of a huge sun and squeeze it down to the size of a softball, the gravity coming off of that softball is going to be as much as the gravity was off of the huge sun. 
[04:14:30]  But in the size of a softball, it's going to suck everything in like a drain.  I still think that the rotation...  You love the rotation, don't you?  I just...  I don't know why I'm stuck on that.  I've read a lot about it.  I've listened to a lot of the Stramish.  I don't know why I'm thinking it goes into it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  I'm scared.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, Anthony.  Good morning.  Anyway, why don't we play the tape of us discussing the morning Anthony came in with a wacky shirt.  A wacky collared shirt.  By the way, you don't even have to listen to the bit we're about to play because the answer is periwinkle. 
[04:15:00]  Right.  Hit the tape.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Lo mÃ¡s mal de O.B. and Anthony en XM2-02.  Ah.  TBJ.  I'm trying something different.  Ooh.  Peanut butter and jelly?  Yeah.  I'm eating peanut butter and jelly.  First day of my new thing. 
[04:15:30]  What's the new thing?  I like to eat lunch stuff.  That seems like a really nice little snack right now.  I mean, we get up at what?  I get up at five in the morning.  That's all.  It's four and a half hours since I've been awake.  And for some reason, because it's morning for everybody else, I feel like I have to eat morning food the whole morning we're here.  Mm-hmm.  But that doesn't make sense because now it's kind of lunch for us.  That's right.  So I'm trying to eat, like, lunch now.  I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I eat my lunch in the morning. 
[04:16:00]  See, I eat my lunch with, like, I'll have tuna or turkey or something in the morning.  And then when I get home, you know what I have?  A bowl of cereal.  I'm insane.  I'm a crazy person.  Obviously.  Look at the shirt you're wearing today.  It's very festive, bright, and summery.  What do you have when you get home?  A nice drug cocktail?  Travis, robe on.  What color is that shirt?  That's a light blue with some pink.  Pink?  Travis, there is no pink on this shirt.  It looks pink from here.  This is peach. 
[04:16:30]  Mm-mm.  And this is seafoam green.  Of course it is.  He's saying that's a blue shirt.  And this is blue.  It's lavender.  Lavender, seafoam, and pink.  That is not lavender.  Seafoam and pink.  I won't give you the pink, Anthony.  Even though it's close.  It's more of a peach.  It's peach.  Peach is worse.  Eric, what color is the shirt?  Lavender.  Shut up, would you?  Go ahead.  Lavender, lime, and peach.  It is not lavender.  Lime.  He called it lime.  Ugh.  I said lime green.  He says it's seafoam or something like that. 
[04:17:00]  I want an example.  I'm going to images.  Google.  How do you spell lavender?  Could someone take a picture of just Anthony's shirt?  Q-U-E-E-R.  I want to save him the embarrassment, so don't even get his...  No.  Don't...  Look at lavender.  Let me see lavender.  Look at lavender.  See?  Yeah, that's close.  No.  This is blue.  Let me see.  Thank God you only wear stuff once, so we'll never see the shirt again.  Shut up.  Dude, I watch everyone's rotation around here. 
[04:17:30]  I mean, Norton, just don't even get his face, because I'm trying to save him the embarrassment.  All right.  Now get that shirt up online.  Look, everyone's taking pictures of you and your shirt.  But it's not lavender.  See?  If you look at the lavender on the website here, you'll see that it's purple.  It's close enough.  Everyone's just splashed away.  It's more purple.  You may want to save him the embarrassment, but I don't.  Blue.  Let me see.  Oh. 
[04:18:00]  You stink.  The best part, though, is Anthony doesn't wear anything twice.  I've never seen a rotation come around with your clothes.  I burn them to keep the germs off of me.  Looks kind of more like blue in this photo.  Of course it's blue.  But in real life, it looks more lavender.  I'll try without the flesh.  Lavender is a blue.  Nathaniel, what's the color?  What are the colors of Anthony's shirt today?  Is it a little red added to it?  Is that what lavender is?  This is...  Whose side do I want to come on?  If you say this is lavender, you're wearing a lavender shirt. 
[04:18:30]  Look at the colors.  I enjoy your blue shirt, sir.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  Only for self-defense.  Thank you.  See?  It's the same color.  Wait, now you're claiming that Nathaniel has the same color shirt as you?  Get next to him.  This will prove my point.  Because Nathaniel's now...  Nathaniel's wearing a blue shirt.  That is blue.  Now look at the blue on this.  But notice I have white in with the blue.  That is the same color blue.  I rest my case.  No, his is darker.  No, it is. 
[04:19:00]  That's just because I have some white.  No, his is definitely more manly.  Yours is yours.  Mine is not a solid blue.  Your blue is missing some T-cells.  There's white spots and white stripes over here.  All right.  Sure, why not?  Your blue is too weak to answer the door.  I have to have a friend come over and make it broth.  Brought.  Brought.  Mm-hmm.  Your blue should be tied to a fence in Wyoming. 
[04:19:30]  Jesus.  Look at this.  It's a wonderful blue.  It's not lavender.  And I really think this shirt will set the whole look off.  Faggot.  Didn't they do a Queer Eye thing with the Boston Red Sox recently?  Oh, that was their...  Yeah, they took like Johnny Damon and a couple of the other guys and gave him a little makeover. 
[04:20:00]  They didn't cut his hair, though.  Let's go to Krista in Jersey.  Krista, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hello.  Anthony, I haven't seen your shirt, but I am going to guess that the color is actually  periwinkle, which is pretty gay.  Oh, my God.  Is there an actual color called periwinkle?  It's not periwinkle.  Periwinkle.  You can punch up periwinkle, and I bet you, sight unseen, that is the color of your shirt. 
[04:20:30]  Periwinkle?  Oh, my Lord.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Periwinkle.  Uh-oh.  It's not saying no.  All right.  It might be periwinkle.  Oh, my God.  You're wearing periwinkle.  Periwinkle?  Hey, periwinkle with...  You're wearing periwinkle with a peach tiny stripe and a foam green stripe.  See, foam green, periwinkle, and peach.  Periwinkle looks a little too lavender still.  I don't know.  For me. 
[04:21:00]  This is blue.  It's fucking blue.  Dude, I will take away that I think it looks lavender, if you'll admit it's periwinkle.  It is periwinkle.  It's more periwinkle than lavender.  I don't think it's periwinkle.  I think it's blue.  Steve?  I'd say blue.  Steve, what's the color of his shirt?  Periwinkle or blue?  Be honest.  Don't be a pussy like everyone else around here.  What's the color?  What is it?  I just looked at some periwinkle online.  That's pretty close to periwinkle.  It's not periwinkle.  What about those stripes that go through the whole shirt?  The stripes, pink and green. 
[04:21:30]  No, it's pink.  It's peach.  Atta boy.  It's peach.  You know, my sister-in-law had a wedding.  I was in the wedding, and the dresses were periwinkle.  All right, this guy wants to spell lavender for Anthony.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hi, guys.  Anthony asked earlier how to spell lavender.  Yeah.  G-A-Y.  The beauty, though, he'll never wear this shirt again. 
[04:22:00]  He doesn't wear anything twice.  I will wear this at some point.  And if you don't wear it, just make it into a bumper sticker and put it on the back of  your car.  A little rainbow shape.  Take that shirt and make a quilt patch.  A quilt.  There's a society called the Periwinkle Communique.  The color is exactly the same.  No.  It is.  That's more purple.  It's purple.  This is blue.  There is no mistaking this isn't blue. 
[04:22:30]  Periwinkle.  That's periwinkle.  She nailed it.  That fine woman nailed it.  It's periwinkle.  I'll give you periwinkle, Anthony.  I'll take the lavender away.  Periwinkle, seafoam, green and pink.  Go with that.  It's a fine shirt.  Periwinkle isn't even a color.  Do you realize a slip is a more masculine shirt?  I like my summery shirt.  It's great.  It should be a little longer.  You should come down to maybe your mid-knees.  Anthony, fashion's all about taking chances, and I want to congratulate you on taking a chance 
[04:23:00]  today.  You're taking chances out there.  God, you know, I walked in, I'm barely awake, but I noticed your shirt on me.  Oh, I know.  And Anthony was already prepared with the comebacks and everything.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Ah, yeah.  He just goes, ah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It's colorful.  I got you.  I'm on it.  I dressed myself this morning.  I know what I put on.  Very colorful. 
[04:23:30]  It's a nice shirt if you're going boating with a bunch of male friends and you watch  the Tonys.  You think Nathan Lane's a hoot, do you?  Yeah.  Ah, sure.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  Oh, Jesus.  Enjoy the next hour and a half with your little Periwinkle shirt.  Rob from Cherry Hill.  I've never heard a man defend that his shirt is not gay by screaming, it's peach.  Yeah, I know the peach doesn't really take away from... 
[04:24:00]  Yeah, I can't.  I'm trying to think if I have anything that has peach on it.  Yeah, probably not at all.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah!  We have confirmation.  Confirmation.  This just in off the AP wire.  Can't do that sound, but Anthony is indeed wearing a Periwinkle shirt. 
[04:24:30]  Yes, it is Periwinkle.  Well, my girlfriend just emailed me and said, yes, it is Periwinkle.  So, right from the source.  You know, after that last guy, though, saying that it could be...  I'm wearing a Periwinkle shirt.  You certainly are.  Take it off.  You got a t-shirt underneath this.  No, that's nice.  Leave it out.  It looks good on you.  Periwinkle.  Yeah.  You know, but I think you...  I think it's better than what the last listener came up with. 
[04:25:00]  Oh, cornflour blue?  Cornflake blue or corn...  Cornflake blue.  Cornflour blue.  You needed the money.  I liked it on you.  It actually brings out the load in your eye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, you clever fuck.  Damn it.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy. 
[04:25:30]  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is... 
[04:26:00]  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hmm, breastfeeding.  Barbara Walters was right.  She made some kind of a snide remark on The View about how she's uncomfortable about  women breastfeeding.  Well, the way she said it was, every time I see it, I want to grab the kid's foot and  throw him through a window.  Nothing, Opie?  Please let that be a fucking...  The...  Conglomerated...  mongrel toilet. 
[04:26:30]  I fucking blow.  Mongrel toilet.  I went to say Mulata underwear, and I said, mongrel toilet.  You stink.  I really am.  Fucking...  Wow, that sucked.  Mix...  Oh, that was awful.  That's got a wet bubble involved with it.  I think I just blew out a clot.  I can't take your mouth.  It smells like copper.  Get out of here.  Where are we in this stupid worst-up thing? 
[04:27:00]  We're talking about breastfeeding and how uncomfortable it is when women are just breastfeeding in public.  Well, sometimes it's hot.  It's never hot.  Sometimes it's hot.  Young mothers?  Breastfeeding?  Never.  It's never a young mother who's hot.  Their lovely child?  Sorry.  All right.  What's hotter, breastfeeding or this?  You know what's awful?  Just knowing how backed up your logs are.  That probably took an hour to pass all that backed up, caked-in shit. 
[04:27:30]  That probably started 45 minutes ago.  I had to squeeze past all those compressed logs.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Like between two buildings in New York?  That one in space?  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Oh, you are Gary Gass today.  I sure am.  It's awful.  They're moist.  Let's listen to us talk about breastfeeding on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:28:00]  All right, Anthony, so what's up with the breastfeeding outside ABC?  You knew about this one.  I heard this on the news on the way in.  So nearly 150 angry moms.  150.  That's 300 tits if they're all healthy.  Angry in capital letters, Anthony, so they must have been really angry.  Well, Barbara Walters said something on her show on The View that upset breastfeeding mothers.  Oh, no.  She said that when she's on an airplane, she feels uncomfortable. 
[04:28:30]  That's all she said.  Uncomfortable when a woman starts breastfeeding next to her in the seat next to her on a plane.  And most people do feel uncomfortable when they see that going down.  I'm uncomfortable around women that breastfeed.  All women?  Yeah.  Even the young ones?  Even the hot ones.  With the breasts that are just gorging?  They're just begging for attention.  Those big boobs that are begging for attention and the little kid is there? 
[04:29:00]  Those big juice-filled memories.  No.  It's like, oh, I can't fit any more in here.  Where's my kid?  No.  Nothing?  Leaking into a bra?  Nothing.  Just leaking because the boobs are wanting.  Sorry, kids.  Sweet, sugary, life-giving treat.  It ain't doing nothing for me.  Nothing.  The new mother can't even find a bra that's big enough because they just want to be swinging.  Like warm cereal milk. 
[04:29:30]  They're pushing.  They're pushing.  Why is it pushing?  It's not hot.  Babies are just the destroyers.  They are the tits wrecking ball.  They ruin breasts.  Why do I want?  Even if there's some hot chick breastfeeding, you just know what's being ravaged.  No.  No?  No.  I'm uncomfortable with it.  And I don't think it should be done in public like that.  Some women are better at it than others. 
[04:30:00]  There's probably women breastfeeding all the time.  I don't even notice.  It's the ones that are like, half the tit is hanging out.  The kid's hanging off of it.  Well, Anthony, I guess you agree with Barbara Walters today.  You and Barbara.  What, am I supposed to find that hot, Ben?  No.  Heidi Klum?  No.  Heidi Klum and Seal.  Boy, if that doesn't hurt every white man in the country.  You want to make the move, go ahead.  But Jesus, do you have to picture a guy with fucking burn marks on his face?  Do you have to get our supermodels? 
[04:30:30]  Jesus Christ.  You tell me if Seal was an autoworker, that she'd be with him, and he got scarred in some  kind of an accident when he was 14?  Yeah, I was driving a fucking Dodge, and I hit a wall, and now I'm all scarred up.  But because he's an African, and he's saying, kiss by a rose, he's carrying his baby.  That's it.  A mongrel baby.  Both races will be destroyed.  All right.  All right. 
[04:31:00]  Well, let's get back to Barbara Walters here.  Yeah, she's uncomfortable.  So she talked about on her show, The View.  Yeah, she's on The View.  You know, those four get cackling about everything, and she, I guess, let that one slide.  Why could, she says that on The View, and then next thing you know, there's 150 angry moms  protesting outside ABC Studios.  Well, we're, let's make a statement.  We're uncomfortable, too.  Right.  Yeah.  Damn it.  And we're on 57th Street.  Yeah.  Between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue.  Uncomfortable. 
[04:31:30]  Very uncomfortable.  With the breastfeeding.  Yeah.  And we don't like the Irish.  And we'll get, show them.  Yeah, and we'll get, we'll get different results.  Here comes tomorrow.  Hoping for all the protesters, we look out the window.  Oh, there's nothing out there.  Why?  Why can't we get the protesters?  Can I say, I'm uncomfortable with girls who have large clitorises, wearing tight panties  that show them off and standing in front of me.  I hate that.  What is that picture?  That is just hot.  A girl.  That is not hot. 
[04:32:00]  A girl in the shade at the beach on her beach blanket, and the kid is suckling as she, she  pulled down her.  It's got the bikini, she takes the bikini top off, and a moose nose came flopping down,  and the kid is now making out with a moose.  What's uncomfortable about that picture is the fact that the kid looks like he's five.  He's grabbing her belly.  Oh, kids.  Did that boy have...  That's just got to piss off dad, man.  Could that kid have blonder hair?  She's fucking breastfeeding Hitler's nephew. 
[04:32:30]  Sorry, I wasn't even listening.  It stung, and you know what's annoying?  That I caught myself starting it as I was walking, and I said, no, let me get to the  mic so everyone can hear it.  Oh, that kid's too old.  Look, he's giving eyes, like, holy Jesus.  Could you get these pictures up on opiateathlete.com so we could share with our listeners?  That kid is giving, like, bedroom eyes to the camera, like, yep, I'm getting some titty. 
[04:33:00]  And there's nothing you could do about it.  That is too old.  Hey, Dad, look at this.  Daddy, they're mine too, asshole.  You know what makes a woman uncomfortable?  If they want to breastfeed on a plane and I'm next to them, I'll just watch and do this.  Mmm.  Start licking your lips.  Mmm.  When the stewardess comes over and asks me what I want, I'll be like, can I have a baba?  A baba?  All right, here's the story, Anthony.  Mmm. 
[04:33:30]  Lactose intolerance is the headline.  Of course it is.  Breastfeeding.  And they're holding up signs.  One lady held up a sign saying, breastfeeding.  We wouldn't be here without it.  Yeah.  Nearly 150 angry moms, babies at their breasts, staged a peaceful nursing yesterday outside ABC's Manhattan Studios in defense of Mother's Milk, Anthony.  Well, how violent could a nursing be?  The kid sucks their tits and they throw them against the window to cause a ruckus?  They take the kid off their boom and start squirting it at everybody. 
[04:34:00]  Swing the kid by the feet.  Get back, you or I'll shoot.  Barbara's a C-word.  They start chanting it with their babies, swinging.  Uh, the woman, uh, the women, excuse me, self-named, uh, Lactivists.  Huh?  What?  Lactivists?  Lactivists?  I get it.  Because of lactose.  And they're activists, Lactivists.  Took to the streets after Barbara Walters' interview, uh, uh, Barbara Walters' interview queen and host of The View made what they considered disparaging comments about breastfeeding on the talk show. 
[04:34:30]  Walters said she felt awkward sitting with her hairdresser next to a woman who was breastfeeding on an airplane.  There you go.  It made me very nervous, Walters said.  She didn't cover the baby with a blanket.  It made us uncomfortable.  Ah, see?  She didn't cover the baby.  You gotta cover that dirty thing.  Don't be honest and express the way you feel in our society.  People don't like it.  Co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who, uh, was that survivor chick.  Who?  She's a co-host on The View? 
[04:35:00]  Yeah, now she's, uh, one of the, one of the...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's, there's Barbara.  Mm-hmm.  There's Star.  Mm-hmm.  There's, what's her name, the comic?  Wait, wait, wait.  Barbara, does Barbara grape Joy, and who else?  Joy.  Right, that's three.  Then there's that, like, housewife one, Meredith.  And then I thought there was, uh, the Asian girl.  The chinky's, uh, gone.  Opie.  It's an Asian girl.  She's working for the, uh, for National Geographic or something like that. 
[04:35:30]  She is?  Something, yeah.  She's like...  Oh, she'll see Star again soon.  Oh, God.  I knew her.  I didn't say it, though.  I just, you know, was giving information, and this...  I didn't say anything.  I heard nothing about Star leaving The View.  I said she'll see her again soon.  Other, uh, other, uh, ventures.  Who is that?  Oh, that's her right there?  Yeah, from Survivor.  Bigger picture?  Eric?  Can you click on the picture?  Does it get bigger?  Right click.  What's the matter?  Right click.  Eric?  Eric, go over.  No, it doesn't get bigger.  Do that over there. 
[04:36:00]  Not in right-clicking punk motherfucker?  No, over there.  Right there.  Down?  Down.  To the left?  No.  That's the menu bar.  It's there.  We got it.  Yeah.  Perfect.  All right.  So, uh, co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who is nursing her daughter, Grace, said she was  uncomfortable breastfeeding in general, Anthony.  The show's host also seemed to celebrate the news that Hasselbeck's daughter had her first  bottle of formula, spurring women in four cities to lift children to their breasts in 
[04:36:30]  a synchronized milk-in yesterday.  Milk-in.  Just look.  And it's because of lactate, not lactose, you ass.  Look, I'm not even going to get into it with you.  What happened?  Um, the guy, because I said lactose and they're lactivists, and because of lactose, but this  guy says lactate, but the paper right there in front of me says lactose intolerant, and  that's the whole thing.  You know what? 
[04:37:00]  I'm not going to argue with the listeners anymore.  See the, this is the instant feedback screen.  See it?  See it?  Watch what I do.  I go to the upper right-hand corner.  Don't, don't, don't.  Boy, I close the browser.  No, you can't do that.  Now you can, now you, you know what?  No, you can't do that.  If an instant feedback is posted in the forest and no one's there to read it, did anyone  really post it?  How about that, my friends?  Now, post all you want, because now, if I don't read them, it's like you never fucking  posted them.  Okay?  I'm punishing you all.  No instant feedbacks today.  But, but you can't do that to the rest of us. 
[04:37:30]  None.  We enjoy the little, uh, comments that come in.  None.  None.  I do not pardon you.  Sometimes they make us chuckle.  Now I shoot you all.  You can't do that to everybody.  That's what happens.  I close the browser.  Kid left a ring around the computer.  Gotta shoot him.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  All right, well, then we get, then we get comments from the nursing, uh, the nursing  moms there.  Just look away if it's really that offensive.  Said Anushka. 
[04:38:00]  Anushka?  Anushka?  What a hot name.  Hey, Anushka.  Suck it.  The women carrying signs like Mama's Latte is Best.  Latte, sorry.  Said they worry the comments might keep new moms from nursing.  Some are demanding an on-air apology.  Oh, what the?  Which I guarantee they'll do today, so roll tape, because they'll, uh, I'm telling you.  All right, all right, here's the last instant feedback I'm reading.  Wait, you already turned it off, sweetie.  No, no, I, I, I had, like, the browser up, and I was going to close, but Pat from, Pat from 
[04:38:30]  Munaki, I have to read it.  He goes, I lack toe.  That's very funny, because he's got nine toes.  I lack toe.  You ass.  Now I'm shutting it.  It's over.  No, you can't.  It's over.  Everything with Pat comes down to a missing digit.  He's going to find his angle.  Oh, God.  So they're demanding an on-air apology. 
[04:39:00]  We'll roll tape on that, because something stupid will happen today.  I'd do it on the subway.  I'd do it in the library.  I'd do it in the park.  I've never been a particularly shy person, but some people are, and they shouldn't be  discouraged from doing something natural, said Jennifer.  I think, I think the moms are right, and Barbara Walters is wrong.  I think they're right.  Oh, why?  Because I think that we are too repressed sexually about stuff like that, and as long as the  motives aren't to be shocking, but if you're genuinely breastfeeding, I think it's a healthy  thing, and I think the first to sexualize it is unhealthy. 
[04:39:30]  Hey, did Barbara Walters say not to do it?  No, not at all.  That's just it.  Now, what they want, they don't want the ability, they have the ability to breastfeed wherever  the fuck you want.  Hang it out.  But you're not going to convert me to make me feel comfortable about it.  I think that Barbara Walters is a bit uptight about it, but I also think they're overreacting  and being a bunch of annoying, self-righteous twats, demanding an apology and protest.  Who gives a fuck what that irrelevant Crypt Keeper says?  Who cares?  She's 70.  Who cares? 
[04:40:00]  Her tits are giving cottage cheese.  Nobody cares what she says.  No one.  No one.  All right, well, why don't we go to the phones?  We don't freaking like it.  Don't look.  Whatever.  You know?  Leslie, who are you talking to?  Huh?  Who are you talking to?  Oh, I'm just, I'm talking about Barbara Walters, and she doesn't want to see it.  Are you one of those listeners that talks to the radio as the show's going on?  Were you talking to the radio?  Who were you talking to?  Because we plunked the phone down and you were already talking.  Huh?  We, we, we, we answered the, do I have to shut the browser for the phones too? 
[04:40:30]  No, don't turn off my phones.  We plunked the phone down and picked you up and you were already talking.  I'm sorry.  Who were you talking to?  Who were you talking to?  I was talking to y'all.  Yeah, but we weren't even on the phone yet.  That's like you call your mother, right?  Yeah.  And, and, and it's, it, it's ringing and your mom picks up and you're already talking to her.  Like, do you do that?  No, not usually. 
[04:41:00]  See?  But that's what you just did.  Yeah, you confused all of us.  That's all.  Okay, well, I'm a Sprint customer, so I get cut off a lot.  And, uh, yeah, I talk to myself sometimes, so.  All right, go ahead, Leslie.  What do you have to say?  So you agree with Barbara Walters?  No.  Are you, are you a mom?  No, but I have taken care of children.  I am close to, you know.  You've breastfed children?  No.  No, I'm, I'm a godmother, yes, but not an actual mother. 
[04:41:30]  But my whole thing is, whatever a woman wants to do, if they want to breastfeed the kid, whatever.  If they don't, whatever.  I, I agree, but like Barbara Walters was saying that if the baby is breastfeeding,  to stop it, you should curl up your fist and punch the infant.  How do you feel about that?  Well, whatever she wants to say, whatever.  But if she doesn't like to see it, she just needs to look away.  All right, Leslie, thank you.  All right.  There goes Leslie in Wisconsin.  Let's go to Army, the trucker.  I think they fit quite nicely in the airplane bathroom toilet. 
[04:42:00]  Good morning.  That big head kind of stuck spinning around before.  But it won't go all the way down.  And all you see is five little, five little telling fingers poking through.  No one wants to sit down anymore.  It's a killjoy.  And the worst is when you pick up the baby and you go to walk to the, walk to the bathroom  to give the baby to mom and it tries to suck your dick.  Oh, really?  Oh. 
[04:42:30]  Jesus.  Maybe you ought to work out.  I was going to say, you might want to join a gym.  Yeah, what's the matter with you, me?  My ex-wife's tits have been destroyed by our kids.  Were they?  Oh, my God.  It's disgusting.  Oh, my God.  It was horrible.  What was it like when you first met your wife?  Oh, turn on titties.  I mean, boing, swing.  What were her titties like?  Describe her titties.  Her titties were, oh, gorgeous.  They were like, I don't know, a beautiful little dish.  It's just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah. 
[04:43:00]  One of those numbers, you know, like.  Nice perky.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Were the nipples perky up on top of her boobs?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Very tight.  Oh, and when there was a nice cold day and they'd poke out, I would sit there and flick  them through her shirt and, oh, yeah.  And now what are they like, sir?  They hang down to her freaking belly button.  It's disgusting.  Does she have stretch marks on them now?  Oh, yeah, definitely, Jimmy.  And tell us about the nipples.  They're like, they're like huge now. 
[04:43:30]  I mean, full moon and just craters and the whole nine yards.  Craters.  Oh, they're disgusting.  Wow.  Oh, my God, boys.  Oh.  All right.  We get it.  Your wife's tits are awful.  Oh, loves this stuff.  Ex.  Ex-wife.  That's why she's my ex.  Well, I didn't buy this.  I didn't buy this.  Take care, man.  I'm punching out.  Bye, mister.  There goes Army, the trucker.  No, Eric was showing me one of the hottest breastfeeding scenes in movie history.  Where?  This movie was with the chick from Risky Business. 
[04:44:00]  Rebecca De Mornay.  Oh, is that the hand that rocks the cradle?  What a great movie.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  She was a real sicko.  She was watching, she was like a babysitter, like a nanny.  Yeah.  And she had some issues, and she decided-  She starts breastfeeding.  Look at that kid going to town.  Starts breastfeeding the kid to the point where the kid doesn't want any of mommy's milk.  Yeah.  And the mommy doesn't understand why there's a-  Oh, she completely bonded with the baby, and mommy doesn't understand why there's a 
[04:44:30]  rejection issue with her newborn.  And then she becomes a psycho, a complete psycho.  Wow, that's pretty good.  She's actually breastfeeding in that scene.  Yeah.  Is that her kid or something?  How did they do that?  That's a good question for somebody.  Why the hell would you let your kids suck on Rebecca De Mornay's tit for a movie?  Well, that's a nice mom.  That's a good mom.  That's a real sport.  That's a mom you take care of when she goes into the old age home.  Oh, God. 
[04:45:00]  There's a picture of babies that are a little too old to be breastfeeding.  It's all over this website.  Remember the time-  I know we go back a lot with this show.  I mean, we could redo it again.  I don't care.  We had a woman come in at N.E.W.  Her kid.  Someone's got to help me.  You remember her name and everything?  Wow, you're good.  You know her.  Well, stop it.  Wait a minute.  Can I just-  Can someone smack me in the face whenever I don't figure something out with Jimmy?  Whenever I don't see it as plain as daylight? 
[04:45:30]  Could you just slap me?  Of course he knows her.  Of course he does.  She's a lunatic.  And she was on our show.  She was on our show.  That's the prerequisite.  The one who breastfed her 30-year-old son, that one?  30-year-old son.  Right.  And the son acted like he was five.  Kid would suck her tits while he was on the cell phone.  We had-  Making a prom date.  Well, she has a name.  We had Kate come in.  Kate.  Because we were talking about this breastfeeding issue, and she came in with her-  Come on, help me out. 
[04:46:00]  Three and a half, four-year-old?  No, he was older than that.  Oh, maybe.  He was like four or five.  Ben might even know.  I mean, it was way up there, and the kid was practically standing up as he was breastfeeding.  It was way too old to be breastfeeding.  Way too old.  He had his baseball hat on, I remember, and he was giving us all looks as he was doing it.  It was the creepiest thing I've ever seen.  One of the creepiest things I've ever seen in studio.  Her need to feel loved and helpful kind of overrode, I thought, what was good for him.  But again, maybe technically she was okay to do it.  So when you had sex with her, how was she? 
[04:46:30]  Not bad.  I mean, I never had sex with her.  Oh, no?  Oh, okay.  No.  That's the baby?  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Eric is really good at a lot of things.  You know the baby that rocks the cradle?  Yeah.  That's her now.  She was born in 1985.  She's now 20 years old.  Holy Jesus.  And hot as shit.  What has she been in?  She's been in a few movies.  Tell me she lists the credit that she was the baby in Hand That Rocks the Cradle.  Oh, my God. 
[04:47:00]  The Hand That Rocks...  Wait, something's wrong here.  What's wrong?  Maybe Hawk...  Yeah, Hawk, you're wrong.  Hawk stinks.  You're off.  You stink again.  He's dumb.  He's totally off.  He's good at a lot of things.  Let me explain it because it's kind of funny, actually.  He shows me this young actress that's about 20 years old or will be 20 later this year,  okay?  And goes, this is the baby from Hand That Rocks the Cradle.  Now, I'm doing the math in my head.  I'm like, 1985 she was born.  That movie was not in the mid to late 80s. 
[04:47:30]  So then I looked down and her credit list, Hand That Rocks the Cradle, movie came out in  92.  She would have had been a seven-year-old girl in the movie.  Now, that would have been a scene to see.  I'll say.  I think there was another daughter that was in that movie or something like that.  Yeah.  Probably.  It would probably be listed as the baby or something.  And that baby would be about 13, 14.  He had a good thing going.  You said he was really good at certain things.  Yeah.  And then he just kind of took it away again.  Yeah, I know.  Well...  Why don't you tell him he's good at something else? 
[04:48:00]  Because Eric is a very talented guy.  It's three children.  Three children.  What?  Oh, she was one of three?  Eric Melender.  That's odd.  Jennifer Melender and Ashley Melender.  Triplets.  Are they all related?  They have to be triplets.  Yeah, they were...  Well, wait a minute.  One was born in 91, November 10th, 91.  Yeah, November 10th, 91.  They're triplets.  And that does seem to be their only acting credit. 
[04:48:30]  That they sucked on a boobie.  Not bad.  Three kids.  Who was the lucky one that got to suck on the boobie?  The youngest, probably.  Let's go to San Francisco.  Caitlin, what's up?  Hey, I just want to call in as being one of the...  Probably the few females that's going to say, I hate the breastfeeding bullshit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'm San Francisco, so you know it's weird.  Are you a mom?  No.  God, no.  Little Life Destroyers.  I know.  She's a dyke.  I'm not a dyke. 
[04:49:00]  No?  No, I'm actually...  I'm married to a man, and I've called into the show before.  Oh.  I had the creepy hairbrush story about the sororities.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't remember.  I do, actually.  I don't remember.  I remember.  You had the hairbrush, and the whole thing happened.  Yeah, the sex with the hairbrush story.  Right, right, right.  That's one of our favorite stories.  What?  Well, personally, I think it should be against the law.  Wait, do you...  Let me ask you a question.  What? 
[04:49:30]  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, God damn it.  All right, Caitlin, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Guys, we don't get many women that call the show.  Come on.  That is so bad.  They're never going to call the show.  I got scared.  I got nervous talking to her.  You did get nervous.  I saw that.  My fist clenched up, and it just slipped out.  Let's go to Jeff in Illinois.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was at this party, and this hot chick was giving up.  She was breastfeeding, and my buddy is half drunk. 
[04:50:00]  He goes over there, and he goes, hey, let's see that little baby.  Snatches him up.  You hear this roll, and that was...  Yeah, it's to you, Ant.  No, that's okay.  I won't try to blast one into the microphone.  I really wish Ant would get up to do that and then just shit his pants.  I crap myself.  And we'd know something happened when you sat down and put in shot at the bottom of your  fucking pant leg.  Again.  I was thinking a little nugget.  A little nugget drops out. 
[04:50:30]  A nugget?  Oh, the little moist plunk.  Bounces off your Nikes and rolls onto the floor.  I had a nugget when I was on my way to school in fifth grade with Bill D'Angelo.  Yeah.  I had to take a dump, and I would only take dumps at home.  So I tried to tighten up, and a little nugget broke off.  And I said, watch this, Bill.  And I kicked my leg out, and it came out of my pants leg.  Wow.  And Bill remembered that for years.  Was that the time you broke your toe?  Didn't you break your toe or something?  No.  Trying to get to a bathroom?  Was that you?  No.  All right.  Running?  Running. 
[04:51:00]  I don't know.  All right.  Let's go to Kim.  Be nice to Kim, guys.  I will.  I love girls.  Here we go.  Hi, Kim.  Hey, Kim.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Nothing ticks me off more than women who bitch about breastfeeding.  Because there's no reason at all, every opportunity to pump, to feed your child, there's no reason  to do it in public.  Yeah.  Absolutely none.  I disagree.  I don't mind it.  I don't mind being a pervert.  Yeah.  It's like we're too uptight about stuff like that. 
[04:51:30]  Yeah.  You know, it annoys me.  So I can see why men get annoyed.  Because I just feel women do it just to be empowered.  Just to say, oh, I could do something.  There's nothing you could do.  It's almost playing the race card.  Well, I said before, my problem with it, if the motives are right, if somebody is doing  it because they genuinely want to feed the kid and not to, like you said, not to be empowered  and just do it because they can, you know, what kind of an animal gets mad at the mother  breastfeeding the young?  I mean, we're the only creatures that would fucking have a problem with that in the animal  kingdom.  It is kind of uptight. 
[04:52:00]  Yeah.  I mean, if there's no other option but to do it right there, I see that.  I just think it makes me uncomfortable.  I can't look at it.  I don't know where to look.  You have to look away.  And then you're so conscious that you're looking away that you're compelled to turn  your head and actually look.  And I don't want to be in that situation.  I'm selfish.  I don't blame you.  And when you see three or four women sitting together and they're having a tea party with  their breasts, it's annoying.  What I'm saying is just why, like, because I believe Ant's a little bit uncomfortable with 
[04:52:30]  that, but like, why would any of us be, I'm not saying he's wrong, but that just  shows you the way we look at things, like, as like, I guess as a group, it's like,  why would any of our people be uncomfortable with somebody, like, nurturing the...  You know what I mean?  It's just a bizarre...  Then why would they be uncomfortable if I just yank it out and start jacking?  I do.  You're preaching to the choir.  It's natural, too.  That's all natural.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Chicago.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, man.  I'm just saying.  Whip them fuckers out.  There you go. 
[04:53:00]  Whip them fuckers out.  That's right.  Someone get that t-shirt made immediately.  Joe in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a little story.  Sunday afternoon, we're having a barbecue at my girlfriend's mother's house, and our  mother just had a kid about a month ago.  Bullshit!  I swear to God!  You're a dick.  So I'm sitting there eating a hot dog, and all of a sudden, her mother's holding the  kid, and she kind of like pulls down the top of her shirt a little bit, and I'm just  sitting there eating, and all of a sudden, I see the kid just sucking on my girlfriend's 
[04:53:30]  mother's tit, and it's just like everybody's eating, and there's like a whole family there,  and there's the kid enjoying his nice meal, and her mother, it's her mother.  It's not like it's somebody else I don't know.  And the hot dog told me that it had a family at home.  All right, my friend.  First time in a long time, welcome aboard.  We went to this website, it's like a breastfeeding group.  Yeah.  And they have 101 reasons why you should breastfeed. 
[04:54:00]  It's 101 of them.  And one is that, uh, uh, where is it?  Oh, right here.  Uh, much nicer diaper changes.  Really?  Oh, who knew this?  The bowel movements of breastfed babies smell mild and inoffensive, Anthony.  The same cannot be said about those of formula-fed babies.  Try changing a new formula-fed, wait, try changing a few formula-fed babies if you're  uncertain about wanting to try breastfeeding.  That's always good, because you want your kid's shit to smell nice in the house. 
[04:54:30]  Yeah, pleasant-smelling shit.  This is, this shit makes it, it goes from abominable to awful?  Jesus.  Because something tells me the formula-fed shit isn't a real treat.  It's probably better than the formula, but I don't know.  You mean the breastfed stuff is not a treat?  Yeah, yeah, thank you.  Like, it's all just shit.  That's what I'm trying to say here.  It's all just shit.  What, you mean your breastfeeding will have the baby shit inside the car?  I ran out of those little trees. 
[04:55:00]  Squeezed the little guy, a little potpourri.  What's that, what are you doing?  Let's go to Julie in New York.  Julie, two eight-year-olds hanging off of that tit.  They look like Brazilians.  You know, Eric, why?  Why encourage this?  Why?  Why not?  Why?  Hello.  Hi.  Hey, Julie.  I'm calling Opie.  I know that you think that pregnant women are sexy, which I can't believe.  Not all.  Opie does.  Huh?  Opie loves them.  Not all.  Every once in a while, you see one walking around the streets, and it's like, hey, look 
[04:55:30]  at that.  Well, I'm a pregnant woman for the second time, and there's nothing sexy about breastfeeding.  Yeah?  There's nothing sexy about being out in public.  First of all, I'd never do it out in public.  But you have infections you get.  There are shaft nipples, bleeding nipples.  I mean, it's just disgusting.  Why do they turn so goddamn brown?  I don't know.  They get huge, too.  That's the one.  I have big breasts to begin with.  Oh, how big?  I mean, how big? 
[04:56:00]  30-60s.  So when you get pregnant, they are the most painful things you could possibly imagine.  Because they're just filled with all that goodness.  Life-giving, that life-giving sugary juice.  And, you know, as much as they say it's great for a kid.  Just looking for a customer.  There is nothing more than...  My husband, let me tell you.  If he could tell you how disgusting it is to, you know, just have to see that as far as...  Like, I got what they call mastitis, which is infections. 
[04:56:30]  They're engorged.  The child doesn't eat properly.  Wait, wait.  What?  What gets infected?  You have mastitis?  It's called mastitis.  Yes.  It's an infection that you get from becoming engorged.  Where does the infection happen?  In your breast.  In your breast?  So, like, in the glands that make the milk?  That, like, gets pus?  No, no, no.  There's no pus.  Oh, well, it just gets...  They get clogged.  Does it make them swell even more?  Completely swell to the point where they're rock hard. 
[04:57:00]  They get rock hard.  So what do you do with that besides take a pin and fix the problem?  Penicillin.  You have to take medication.  Penicillin.  Can you drain them?  There's got to be pus somewhere.  You have to drain them.  You have to stand in a hot shower and physically drain them.  I'll say...  There's nothing attractive about it.  Why a hot shower?  Because it loosens everything up there, Jimmy.  Come on.  It gets everything, you know...  Open the pores up.  Gets the blood flowing.  I went up with 103 fever. 
[04:57:30]  My whole left side of my body.  I couldn't move it.  That's great.  Have a stroke.  Swollen breasts.  Because you had an infected breast.  Yep.  Because the child...  Not necessarily every child eats properly off of them.  So what happened...  How does the kid cause that by not eating properly?  They just don't drink enough.  Enough?  So you get too much milk in there and unless you milk yourself, the milk sits in there and  like milk on the shelf...  It's supposed to empty out every time they feed.  Yeah, you're supposed to rotate the stock or else it gets over the expiration date and 
[04:58:00]  the container, the carton, bloats.  Right.  It actually...  I got one of those cartons the other day.  I bought milk the other day and I put it in the fridge and I had a little bit of milk  left in one carton and I pour it out over my raisin bran and there's not enough.  So I open up the new carton I just bought and I noticed it was a little puffy, the carton.  So I go to pour it out, it was this clear yellow liquid like piss and then this big square 
[04:58:30]  clump of whatever was left went thawed to the other side of the container.  I didn't even have to say, I think this is bad, you know?  Right, right.  You just absolutely know.  Did you eat this?  How was this?  Did you eat this?  It was delicious.  I like a viscous, milky, yellow type of a milk.  Yellow.  Oh.  Yeah, so that happens inside your titty.  You got it.  Your milk went sour.  The milk goes sour.  Yeah, well, you know, it's been 98 degrees all day. 
[04:59:00]  All right, Julie, hang in there.  Yeah.  Keep your breasts in a nice, cool place.  Hang in there.  We mean your breasts.  There you go.  I'll keep you updated.  Please do.  Okay.  Bye.  There goes Julie.  Julie, very fascinating story there.  God, the phones have exploded.  I mean, should we do some Mayor Menino clips, though?  Eh.  What do you want to keep on this?  I don't know.  Take a couple more calls.  All right, let's say hi to Buster in Brooklyn.  Buster?  Hey, fellas, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Having fun today.  All right.  Hey, listen, you got to try the breast milk in your coffee. 
[04:59:30]  He is one of these idiots.  Are you insane?  I'm telling you, Nelson Rockefeller used to do the same thing.  What?  I did a bio with him when I was in high school years ago.  Can I ask you a question?  What's the worst part of your name?  Is that when people talk to you, they always sound angry?  No, not really.  Hey, Buster.  What if they have to show him something?  Look here, Buster.  Or my poor wife.  Oh, fuck me, Buster.  I'm telling you, try it. 
[05:00:00]  Maybe you can get some girls up there who are ready to breastfeed.  Put it in your coffee.  No, thank you, Buster.  Enough of you.  Hang up on him.  Let's go to Mundy.  I hate Buster.  Mundy in South Carolina.  Hey, guys.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony program.  Well, thank you.  That was a great bit.  We heard that yesterday.  Hey, what's your sister's name?  Tuesday?  Yeah.  Hey, when you get depressed, they say you're really manic Mundy.  I've never heard any of those before.  Mundy, Mundy.  You've never heard any of those either. 
[05:00:30]  So good to me.  So original.  I'm sure.  They call her Stormy Mundy, but Tuesday's just as bad.  Don't forget, I don't like.  I don't like Mundy.  I don't like Mundy.  It's not even spelled that way, but that's funny.  M-U-N-D-E-E, right?  M-U-N-D-E-Y.  All right.  M-U-N-D-E-Y.  Wait, where's the N?  No.  M-U-N-D-E-Y. 
[05:01:00]  Oh, Mundy.  Oh, Mundy.  Selling lesson, yeah.  What do you got?  You're a former breastfeeder.  Yes.  Actually, I have a 14-month goal, and I quit breastfeeding at eight months, and I never  did it in public.  I always covered up, was even embarrassed going around family.  But my sister, on the other hand, she has a kid that's three years older than mine, and  she just whooped hers out anywhere.  And it even, it grossed me out.  She was my sister.  So, didn't really agree with that. 
[05:01:30]  All right.  Thanks, Mundy.  All right.  Thanks for making fun of my name.  I appreciate it.  All right.  We didn't mean it.  We're sorry.  All right.  Watch his answer.  She hasn't heard every single one of those.  It's like me growing up hearing that, Anthony, it's Wednesday.  It's Prince Spaghetti Day.  Any kid named Anthony that grew up when those things were on?  Ugh.  Constant.  Yeah, you know how it is.  You have Opie with, where's Aunt Bea?  How many times do you hear that one? 
[05:02:00]  Probably about seven times.  Yeah.  That's it?  Fuck eight, maybe?  Hey, Jimmy, here's a porch.  Pop this into your mouth.  All right.  One more and we'll move on.  Jaeger?  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Is your last name Meister?  Or is your first name Chuck?  LOL.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  Opie in the camp today.  Here we go.  Walk-a-walk-a. 
[05:02:30]  What the fuck is that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What an ass.  I can't believe. 
[05:03:00]  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, god damn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on, say what?  What?  Scott, the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!  Oh!  He with me?  Fuck it.  Hey!  Whoa, hey!  Back, back, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up. 
[05:03:30]  XM 202, the O.P. and Anthony show.  Jimmy.  Hold on.  Finally.  Finally.  He's finally done.  Wow.  We go down memory lane here and play some of the bits that kind of made us chuckle.  And this one made us laugh pretty good.  It was a discussion on this gay gym.  Yeah.  And the things that were going on in the locker room, in the showers, in the steam room, and even when they were trying to lift weights. 
[05:04:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Oh.  He's done.  He feels a lot better.  I'm a new man.  Yeah.  Congratulations, Jimmy.  I thought that toilet bowl a lesson.  Oh, you have any idea how good that's up?  There he is.  Hey, Jim.  Hi, guys.  What's that?  Hey, you're on the phone and the mic.  Yeah, it's kind of nice.  No, it's not.  It's really annoying, you ass.  No, it's fine.  Let's all do a show like this.  I'd love to.  Where we're all on a phone. 
[05:04:30]  What?  Hello.  I'm hanging up on you.  Echo.  I hung up.  Yeah, well, I'm right here.  Well, it's too late, because we're going to play this bit, and now we're done.  Play it, man.  You're finally back.  I want everybody to know that I was all right.  All right.  Well, we're going to start a brand new Opie and Anthony show in just a few moments here.  But first, check this out.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay.  Terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  All right.  Well, we're going to get into just some stuff that is happening around New York, I guess, 
[05:05:00]  around the country, around the world.  Things that may have given us a little chuckle this morning as we went through the newspaper.  There's a lot of chuckles.  High-end Chelsea Gym.  Now, what's the name of this place?  David Barton Gym?  Yeah, I guess so.  Have you been to the David, the posh, as they call it, David Barton Gym on West 23rd Street?  Great place.  You've been there?  I do.  All the time.  I like to work out there.  I like to hang out, socialize.  You've been there, huh?  Yeah, many times.  Ross, have you been there? 
[05:05:30]  Never even heard of it.  Good answer.  Great gym.  Look, Carlos Sosa.  That's the answer we're looking for.  Carlos Sosa.  I don't like him.  The suing.  25 grand.  He's trying to get because he claims that gay sex is rampant in the locker room.  And this is a posh gym.  This is one of these uppity-up gyms there, Anthony.  And that the club staff has been unable to stop the steamy hijinks.  Since when is ass-fucking called hijinks?  By the way, what's the address on that?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to give you that. 
[05:06:00]  It's not gay if you just stop in to work out and get blown.  He says he was shocked to see men performing sex acts on each other in the shower.  Is it ogling or oogling?  Ogling.  Or ogling.  I always say ogling.  I say ogling.  I say ogling.  Ogling would be two O's, Anthony.  Ogling.  Ogling.  I say ogling.  Ogling.  What do you say?  Ogling.  Ogling.  It is ogling.  Ogling.  Ogling.  That's the way you pronounce it.  I've been mispronouncing that word.  I add that to the list of words I mispronounced. 
[05:06:30]  It's just like peeping at him, looking, longingly, looking at him in the locker room and leering  at him as he changed his clothes.  The gym misrepresents what it's all about, says Sosa's lawyer.  They represented themselves as a serious place where you could actually work out.  Where you could actually work out.  Is this like you can't even work out in here?  Is it that bad?  You expect me to believe they're faggots because Sosa says so.  Sosa says so. 
[05:07:00]  No, I don't fuck men.  It becomes a saucy steam room that reminds me of the ancient Roman baths, is what Sosa says.  What is he, a time traveler?  How does this remind him of the ancient Roman baths?  He's been there.  Can this guy live another life?  The David Barton gym once hailed as one of the city's hottest new workout centers when  it opened last year in a building that housed the YMCA that reputedly inspired the famous 
[05:07:30]  village people gay anthem.  The YMCA, that should tell you something right there.  Absolutely.  Well, this building has a history.  They needed a security guard to monitor the showers, the locker room, and the steam room.  If that's not peculiar, I don't know what is.  So, apparently, they know there's a little issue, so they have a security guard that monitors  the areas where all this gay sex is going on.  A lawyer for David Barton blasted the suit as frivolous and without merit, said the client  runs a clean establishment. 
[05:08:00]  He claims he first noticed the sexual frolicking in November a few weeks after he started exercising  at the gym, which charged him $950 for a membership.  Is that a lot of money for a gym membership?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah, $950.  He said one day he was walking into the shower area.  Here we go.  This is where it gets hot.  He spotted an employee calling out to someone in a stall.  He said he saw men getting it on through the gaps between the two stalls.  What are you peeking for, fruitcake?  Stop looking.  These guys were doing something to each other, he said. 
[05:08:30]  You could see it in a silhouette.  Sounds sexy, doesn't it?  I'm getting hot.  Doesn't that sound hot?  I really am.  All steamy silhouette.  Looks like they're banging two little Lego people together and you realize it's their cocks  touching.  Maybe they're just good at shadow puppets.  They just want to throw everyone off.  I don't know, I saw one head bobbing and then a little bird flying above.  Sosa said he was so disturbed by the experience and other times when men used to be  and came on to him, he was afraid to use gym amenities such as the steam room. 
[05:09:00]  He claimed he saw gym employees trying to stop the shenanigans.  Shenanigans?  But said their efforts were ineffectual.  Now I'm really uncomfortable and I'm paying for this, he said.  I felt I had to avoid the steam room because God knows if I'll step on something I don't  want to step on.  He's talking about maybe a little pile of jizz on the floor.  That's why they do it in the shower though, it should clean it up fairly quickly. 
[05:09:30]  Right down the drain, no muss, no fuss.  And he can wash your hair while you're blowing someone.  That's got to be cute.  You know, while he's putting his hands in your hair, just rub that scalp a little.  Put a little shampoo there, it's all lathered up as he's pressing the back of your head.  And read this part right here, it says, and everywhere I would walk, they would stare at my big  cock and make remarks at plaintiff Ben Sparks.  He's not going to come in.  He's not going to come in with that.  So, so, let's see. 
[05:10:00]  He claims the last straw came in January when a man approached him in the locker room while  it was empty, sat uncomfortably close to him and leered at him.  But it's bad enough in a regular gym that all these shenanigans, as they so eloquently  put it, are going on when you're in the locker room and there's a naked guy that's just walking  around.  It's really simple.  I work out at a regular gym and you've told a story in the past as well.  And there are guys that just openly walk around the locker room completely naked. 
[05:10:30]  Completely naked, no reason to.  I mean, if you're naked, more than the time it takes to, if you're going to take a shower  or whatever, to take your underpants off and put a towel on, you're gay.  Or you're done, take the towel, put your underwear on, now you're dressed.  There's no reason to take the towel off, get out of the shower as you're drying your bag  and everything.  And then walk around.  This guy's a blow-dry, their hair completely naked.  It's like, why?  In front of the mirrors by the sink, their pelvis sticking out.  Yeah, look at my cock. 
[05:11:00]  What the hell is that all about?  There's no need for that.  Of course not.  Many years ago, Florentine and I were doing these sketches for MTV.  It was Rich Franchese's had a show.  In a bathroom stall.  It was actually in a New York, this is many years, maybe eight, nine years ago, in a New  York gym.  And there was a guy, me and Jim were so immature, we were standing there at the mirror and this  guy came over, totally nude, and starts blow-drying his hair.  And I'm not kidding, his cock was standing straight out.  It might have been an inch long.  Me and Jim are in the mirror, like, he's on one side, I'm on the other. 
[05:11:30]  We look in the mirror, make eye contact, both look down at the guy's hog and just fucking  start laughing.  We had to walk out of the chair.  Two men laughing at your junk.  Just two guys laughing at the tiny genitals of another man.  It was so immature, we had to walk out.  He should have just killed himself.  When I finish today, I'm going over to the Friars Club and take a steam.  And what you're talking about is basically just what happens every moment over there.  Really?  That's just nobody.  You take your clothes off, actually, before you enter the building. 
[05:12:00]  The Friars Club itself?  It's a place, you check your clothes outside.  You're out on the street, you walk in naked, and they're all very cordial and no problem.  Yes, and they've had to move the powdering area.  Because, you know, after you take a steam, you powder yourself so you don't chafe.  And they've had to move it because there was so much powder going on that it was going through  the circulation system, the ventilation system.  It was shutting down the ventilation system.  Because everyone's powdering up.  What the hell is going on over at the Friars? 
[05:12:30]  A bunch of 80-year-old, old showbiz faggots just cleaning you off, looking at each other  naked.  I love powdering my anus.  I'm just saying to myself, I don't believe I'm doing this.  I'm just running my hand up and down the crack of my butt in front of other people.  Do you use an applicator or just your hand?  Yeah, I use an applicator.  It is called my hand.  Really?  Just a hand?  No powder puff?  Powdering your ass is kind of like the way astronauts would have semen thrown on it.  Just dried up like a tank, kind of.  It's like, why do I have to get a cum joke? 
[05:13:00]  What's wrong with me?  You had to.  My apologies.  No.  Exactly.  It's the fact they bring it with them and it's already freeze-dried.  Just add water and throw the load in someone's face.  That's a good friend trying to bail me out of my awful bomb.  Thank you.  I'm fucking sinking that with myself.  Sosa claims he soon has to be let out of the gym contract but was refused.  He said after several attempts to work the matter out, he decided to bring the civil suit.  Do you think there's a possibility he's just a cheap fuck and wanted his money back? 
[05:13:30]  It seems like it's a pretty prestigious gym.  It says here Matt Dillon, Susan Sarandon, Calvin Klein have all been spotted at this upscale gym.  Ooh, Matt Dillon.  The membership contract clearly states that such behavior is not tolerated.  When it has to be in your contract that no blowjobs should be going on in the shower, it should tell you something right there.  But he wants his membership fee back and $25,000 for emotional distress.  Look.  It is disturbing to be around that kind of activity if you don't like it. 
[05:14:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't know, but...  You were in the army.  You do know.  Yeah, I saw it on a daily basis.  In the army?  Oh, sure.  Really?  But this was back...  They didn't have the standards they do now.  They let me in.  And anything could go on in that situation.  Really?  Yeah.  Just two men alone?  Very rarely were they alone.  It was usually some sort of a line.  A bunch of guys?  Yeah, next.  General's son.  Tell us about the general's son.  What is this? 
[05:14:30]  There was this guy.  This was 1973.  This is 1973.  And there was this...  And he seemed gay.  I didn't know what gay was at that time, but he just was very effeminate and everything.  And one time, and I was a squad leader, and they actually...  Six black guys had him in the corner, and they were forcing him to do them one at a time.  And I came in to break it up.  I was 145 pounds.  I had a neck the size of your wrist.  Good job.  And I broke it up, and they let him go, and then they cornered me. 
[05:15:00]  Oh, no.  And I got out of there with...  I think I had to do two.  You know?  I was like Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption.  You know, if you do this, you stick it in my ear, it's going to make my jaw lock up,  and you're going to lose whatever's in it.  It's going to be bitten off.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  I'd peek in and go, okay, you boys have fun.  But, you know, you can threaten them that you're going to bite their cock off. 
[05:15:30]  But when it comes right down to it, it's very difficult to do.  You know, because you tend to over-empathize with your attacker.  It's the Stockholm Syndrome of cock sucking.  That's right.  Like, well, I know that if I was in this situation, I'd want it to feel like this  and not have to be afraid of having it bitten off.  Who am I to judge?  Ross Bennett, everyone.  That's funny.  That's really good.  So that's about it, Anthony, with the gay gym. 
[05:16:00]  I don't know about the $25,000 for emotional distress, though.  It just seems like something you would want.  I obviously give the guy's membership back if he's not into that kind of thing.  But as far as emotional distress, you've got stories to tell your buddies.  You know, dude, I walked in there.  How funny would it be to walk in the bathroom here  and look in the crack in the stall and see two guys going at it?  You'd come back in here and laugh.  You might.  Well, Jimmy would come back and wipe his mouth off and then laugh.  Emotional distress is if they didn't want to do you. 
[05:16:30]  That's the emotional distress.  Maybe he was feeling a little dejected, the whole thing.  Sure.  I joined the David Barton Gemini suit.  I was in the locked room.  I was eyeing someone up, and they said,  Beat it, fatty.  I was so hurt.  So hurt they weren't oogling or ogling or leering.  Or ogling.  No shenanigans going on.  I think we got a guy that used to work at the gym.  Chris from New York.  Chris?  Fellas, I actually used to work at the Reebok Club on the Upper West Side,  but one of my trainer friends asked me if I could fill in for him for the day  down at the Barton Gym.  And so I go down there.  I'm just going to paint a picture for you.  You know when you're at a party and a new hot girl walks in 
[05:17:00]  and everyone turns to look?  Yeah.  That's what it's like being a trainer there.  The first day you go there.  Oh, my God.  And to paint the picture even more,  it's like doing a training session at Studio 54 Circus 81.  Oh, come on upstairs.  Come on upstairs.  You walk in, and you hide up and down by 40 people.  It's like you're on a runway when you walk in.  And then, like you said, if they don't look at you,  and I'm a straight guy, you start getting a conflict.  Like, man, why aren't these guys looking at me? 
[05:17:30]  They're looking at me.  It's a nice to be asked.  Yeah, that description is not over the top of what that guy said.  Why don't they just give the guy his money back?  If a guy acts like he's going to sue, just give him back his $900.  Yeah.  Right there, Chris.  Yeah.  You got the looks, though?  Well, yeah.  Like you said, I heard about the place,  and I heard the reputation of, yeah,  it's pretty much a gay place down in Chelsea to work out,  but it's also had a great reputation as a nice facility.  Got nice ads and stuff on you, Chris.  Yeah, it had a great reputation. 
[05:18:00]  But, yeah, you walk in, and you got, you know,  the cheap T-shirt on, the David Barton black tight T-shirt,  and it pretty much goes from there.  Like you said, it's like doing a training session in Studio 54.  Did you get out of there alive?  Yeah, you got out of there alive.  But, like, you go home,  and you try to explain it to your girlfriend what you did for a living today,  and it doesn't come off well in any way.  You got to scrub off in the shower.  Nothing worse than the smell of a fucking men's locker room.  Isn't it just awful?  It's like doing a training session at West 4th Street bathroom. 
[05:18:30]  Balls and ass.  Ugh.  Thanks, Chris.  Okay.  All right.  It's awful.  It's every locker room.  That's why, even, you know,  the stupid high school locker room is the same thing.  You walk in and just, ugh.  Didn't you have a story where you were at a hotel or something,  and you wanted to just go for a swim?  Was that in Boston, and you had to walk through the gym,  and you told this one story once,  and you were just horrified by just the nudity?  Yeah, well, you had to walk through the locker room.  Right, that's what I mean.  To the pool.  The pool, I mean, yeah.  And I'm just, you know, I'm just in my swim trunks. 
[05:19:00]  I got my towel.  Your swim trunks pulled up a little too high.  Yeah, all high, right under my nipples.  And I'm just walking through.  Just want to go for a dip in the pool.  And I want nothing to do with a men's locker room at that moment.  I just want to go into a pool.  But you have to walk through the locker room.  And it was a gauntlet of penis and ass and nutsack.  Just walking through, and they're all talking to each other naked.  And the bend over to dry your foot as it's up on the bench guy. 
[05:19:30]  Ugh.  He's got his ass just sticking out into the aisle I'm walking past.  It's like, if I want to go to a pool, why should I have to walk inches away from a hairy man-ass?  I shouldn't.  I tell you.  I was working out at New York sports clubs and a sports club in Huntington once.  And you see the same people, you know.  Worked out there all the time.  And you start acknowledging people because you see them all the time.  Because it's awkward when you go from machine to machine.  And I see this one guy, and, you know, so many times I finally figure I might as well say, hey, you know. 
[05:20:00]  So he's kind of nodding at me.  And I go, hey, what's going on?  And he goes, I'm going to go take a shower.  All right.  And I'm like, great.  Why would he say that?  Like, what does that mean?  How about we start with, hey, how are you?  Is that like a, hey, is that a code word?  I don't know.  Maybe it's a code word.  You know, New York sports clubs, they're legitimate gyms.  But this guy had to tell me he was going to take a shower.  I'm like, I don't know if he was expecting me to follow it. 
[05:20:30]  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  Wow.  It was the most awkward thing, because how do you answer that?  Uh, well, you go take that shower.  Be right in.  The answer is really weird.  It might have been actually code for I need to take a shower.  You think it meant nothing?  Yeah.  It could have just been, you know, I don't know you guys.  It's a great show.  You are a bit homophobic.  I'm going to be honest.  One of the things I like, I like about gyms is I like being around men. 
[05:21:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, having me naked not be an issue.  Having my body not be an issue.  Going to the steam room.  I love that whole scene.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  You see?  When he was talking about, when he was talking about the Roman baths, I would have, I would  have, I would do anything to go back and spend an hour in the Roman baths.  Back in time.  To have a slave scraping my back.  Yeah.  And applying olive oil.  A young male slave.  Hey. 
[05:21:30]  Doing that.  I don't even care how old.  I mean, if they're behind you, what difference does it make?  That's true.  That's true.  Do you stand on a couple of phone books?  Some people don't stand in the camp.  Those ancient papyrus phone books.  Those Roman phone books.  Yeah, what?  That's right.  V-I-V-I-I.  X-I-V-I.  X-I-V-I.  Oh, he's not home.  For Alexandria and surrounding.  Fuck, surrounding.  Oh!  Damn, Jimmy. 
[05:22:00]  Resounding areas.  Got it out.  Oh, well.  In my building, I...  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  That's right.  It fits.  There's actually a steam room, and I would go into it, but I would wear a bathing suit.  I would never go in naked.  I just couldn't go in naked.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just healthy.  Some people do that with the towel, and then they take the towel off while they're in there.  Now I don't have a bathing suit on.  Why would you do...  A bathing suit.  I just like that Ross Bennett noticed that we're homophobes.  We are.  Being on the show for ten minutes.  We're the worst.  It has nothing to do, mind you, with any type of condoning of violence for homosexuals or anything 
[05:22:30]  like that.  I don't care what they...  They don't gross me out or something like that, but as far as being homophobic in that  I just don't want to see it or have to be... have to deal with it around me, that's  when I'm homophobic.  In a locker room.  Something like that.  There's no reason for naked guy to be walking around.  None whatsoever.  Naked guy.  He should know that other people probably don't want to see his schlong flapping around as 
[05:23:00]  he goes from the shower to his locker.  Although if you're gay, I mean, you can't...  Not gay guys.  Where are you supposed to go?  All right, well there's a bunch of naked people walking around.  If it was like all chicks, I could be naked in the locker room.  Why should they be the lucky geese?  That's what I'm saying.  Why can't I...  You know, it would be nice if I could walk into a girl's locker room and just sit around  and watch them walking around nude.  Maybe I'm just a little jealous.  Why don't you show up and tease them, that delicious Italian body of yours, and just walk  out of your tight slacks.  That's what I'll do.  Hi, ladies.  Give out the wrong number. 
[05:23:30]  Yeah.  Hey, we got maybe a good story here on the phones.  Beth in Seattle.  Beth?  Hey.  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  What's up, Beth?  Hi.  I actually did hook up with a girl in a locker room once.  Wait, you hooked up with a girl in a gym locker room?  Yeah.  It happens.  It was really cool.  Well, how did it happen?  Well, we were...  I was...  I was...  I woke up at like two in the morning and I go swimming and there was no one around and 
[05:24:00]  this chick came out.  I'd seen her there a couple times before and she was like, you know, walking around naked,  which a lot of women do, which isn't always a good thing in those locker rooms.  But she came out and was like talking to me and saying, hi, and I'm going to go...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's slow down.  You're in...  Are you putting this picture in your head?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I completely...  It's playing like a movie in my head.  This could be the hottest thing.  All right.  So, wait.  You're done swimming.  You're now in the locker room?  Yeah.  And are you...  Do you have your clothes on?  Your little swimsuit on? 
[05:24:30]  I'm in my swimsuit.  And I'm...  And she steps out of what?  The shower or something naked or...  Yeah.  Well, she's...  Yeah.  She comes out of the shower.  Oh, I thought I was alone here tonight so late.  Oh, she's got a little startled.  Sounds like a terrible porno set up.  But, like...  Does she have a nice body?  Oh, yeah.  She's gorgeous.  So, she's gorgeous.  She's standing there pretty much naked and then just strikes up a conversation with you  and...  Yeah.  What's going on in your head?  Are you, like, bisexual, lesbian? 
[05:25:00]  What's going on with you?  Well, I don't know.  I'm a college student.  Whatever.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, you girls are just freewheeling these days.  I love it.  How old was she?  Was she your age or older?  Um, she's probably a bit older.  She's, like, probably 20.  I don't really know.  I would guess she's in her mid to, like, 20s.  Good.  And how old were you?  I am...  I'm 20.  20.  So young.  So tender.  So innocent.  Wow.  Teen lesbianism.  Yeah.  So, what happened?  Well, she... 
[05:25:30]  We started talking and I've seen you around the gym and...  I saw you out at this place one time and...  And she's naked while you're talking to her?  Yeah.  And you have your little swimsuit on.  Yeah.  It was very disconcerting.  I mean, you're talking to someone.  And it's hard enough when you're, you know, talking to someone with clothes on not to let  your eyes kind of wander down.  Right.  Yeah.  And you're like, uh, hi.  When did you get to the fingering?  Hopi?  Hold on.  Just grab her bush right there. 
[05:26:00]  Hey, nice bush.  When did it get to the point where you're like, oh my God, I need that.  Well, she actually took the first step.  She kind of, like, kept taking steps towards me.  Yeah.  And I was, like, standing against the locker and she's like, so, um, hey, can I kiss you?  And I was like...  Did you just go like this?  Shivering.  Her 20-year-old body started shivering. 
[05:26:30]  Was she showing you a red car when she asked you this?  A what?  Nothing.  Oh.  Man, your young body doesn't know what to do.  Yeah, it was good.  But we went into the shower and...  Oh.  Hold on.  So you're up against the locker and so you went for the kiss.  She, like, bended in to kiss, bended.  She bent in to kiss me.  Yeah.  And, like, kind of ran her hands down my body and, like... 
[05:27:00]  Oh, she did.  Did she take off your little swimsuit?  Yeah.  Yeah, where did the swimsuit come off?  In the shower.  So you both go into the shower.  Yeah.  Did she grab you by the hand and lead you in?  Oh, that would have been so hot.  That would have been really hot.  Yeah, definitely.  So you go into the shower.  In my verse of the story, that's what happened.  Yeah, that's what happened.  And you're crying.  Oh, believe me.  I got a three-camera shoot going on in my head right now in this whole scene.  What kind of body do you have?  Very risky to ask this, I know, Anthony. 
[05:27:30]  Yeah, very risky question, Obie.  I've been swimming since I was 16.  Swimmer's body.  Swimmer's body, yes.  Nice, yes.  It's 5'5", about 125 pounds.  Yeah.  And what color hair?  I have short blonde hair.  Short blonde hair.  Little bob cut.  Little, and what size, what size is?  I'll send you guys a picture sometime.  A little cute, I was a teenager haircut.  And what kind of, like, boobs, I guess. 
[05:28:00]  Yeah, what size?  I have B-cups.  B-cups.  Probably with the swimmer's body.  Full Bs, right?  Yeah.  Young enough where they're not moving yet.  Oh, they go, like, bing, bing, bing.  And she goes into the shower, so you follow her in.  Does she take your bathing suit off?  I take it off.  In a cloud of steam, Obie.  Yes.  The shower is so hot, the steam is filling up the room.  So you reach back and unclip your top. 
[05:28:30]  Oh, it was.  And you know it's just.  I hate to destroy the fantasy, but it's not like one of those sexy bikinis.  It was like an all-purpose one-suit, like, Speedo swimming wear kind of thing.  It was one of those ones you have to come in and get in and get in and get in and get in.  I want the one that rides real high up on your hips.  Yeah.  All right, well, it's okay.  But now you're in the shower, and she's telling you to be quiet because, you know.  Yeah.  You guys don't want to get caught. 
[05:29:00]  And it feels so wrong, but it also feels just so right.  So you take off your bathing cap and pull down your suit in 1921.  Then what happens?  Bloomers.  The other totally not romantic thing that happened is she took off her little shower sandal things  and put them down on the floor so she went down on me in the shower.  And she got down on her knees, but she put the sandals down first so that her knees didn't  actually have to touch the gross, slimy legs.  So she looked like when you try to make yourself look like a midget and put your shoes on your 
[05:29:30]  knees and stand up.  A dwarf.  A dwarf.  Dorf on pussy eating.  A dwarf.  Tim Conway's going down on you.  Hey, man, you're wrecking this, Ross.  Sorry.  I'm always kidding.  I'm sorry.  You know, like, the next day she'd wake up with, like, ass on her knee or something like  that.  That is so funny.  Dorf.  Oh, Mrs. Haleigh is...  She had a little golf club with her.  Putting me to the drain. 
[05:30:00]  Dorf.  Dorf on bush.  All right, so...  So she's going down on you, and you're running your hands through her hair?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I was holding on to her because I was kind of scared I was going to slip and  fall.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did she have a nice body, too?  Oh, God, she's beautiful.  I see her there every once in a while now.  Wow.  It never happened that, like, we've been alone again.  I wonder if it would happen again.  Of course it would.  Why don't you hook up?  Why don't you, like, trade numbers and go somewhere? 
[05:30:30]  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wow.  I wonder why she never hooked up with you again.  Did you reciprocate?  I didn't.  No?  I fingered her, though.  I just...  Oh, what a gal.  Like, she was out of there.  Like, we were making out in the shower, and then she was down on me, and I came, and  then, like, she was gone.  Wow.  Did both of you shave?  Well, I'm clean shaved.  She had a little something, but it wasn't, like, gross, hairy, nasty bush. 
[05:31:00]  It was, like, you know, the little, like, little triangle right above.  Nice little Kettering shape.  That's so hot.  She put her little shower shoes down.  Dirty girl.  What a pro, too.  She's done that before.  You don't just think to put shower shoes down and kneel on them.  No, and kneel on them.  And what time of day was this?  It was, like, two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  Yeah, you said you...  All right, yeah.  Were you, like, a little scared someone might walk in? 
[05:31:30]  Well, the cleaning guy comes in right around then, too.  Guy?  Yeah, no.  There's a couple guys that clean the girls' bathrooms from, like, 2.30 to 3 in the morning.  What a treat to walk into.  Can you imagine?  You thought your life sucked.  Hey, ladies.  Zip.  Those guys aren't actually employees.  They just wander through.  For free.  At least that's what I do.  So you had your orgasm, and then she was out of there, huh?  Yeah, she stood up, and she kissed me, and she was gone. 
[05:32:00]  Did she eat your ass?  No.  Sorry I asked you that.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's all right.  Just asking.  That is a very hot story.  That is a very hot story.  You told it very well.  We invented lesbians.  Hoo-hoo robbing.  All on the radio rips me off.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  Hey, Beth, that was a great story.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  It just got the gay out of the show.  We appreciate that.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  People are getting a little upset. 
[05:32:30]  Rob from Philly quit the friggin' jokes.  I have such a rod now.  Get back to the story, you tools.  Stop with the coin, Opie.  What am I hitting?  Enough with the poker chips.  I can't get a boner.  Oh, okay.  Boner.  Love our audience.  They're still using the word boner.  Yeah.  Like it's junior high.  She never hooked up with her again because her sweaty box probably stanked.  I was going to ask her that.  Oh, you know, it probably reeked.  Beth called back.  We're wondering if you had a sweaty box. 
[05:33:00]  She wasn't doing hurdles.  Maybe Beth had a yeast infection and the girl went down and had a milk mustache and she's  like, enough of this chick.  I'd like to know what happened.  Nowhere.  Hey, Liddy.  All right, we got Ross Bennett in the studio.  You guys have the greatest job in the world.  Did you enjoy that one, Ross?  I'm so hot.  This is like...  Yeah.  That is really nice.  And you don't have commercial breaks for me to run off to the bathroom.  Rub one out.  That's right.  That's why we all just do it right here. 
[05:33:30]  Yeah, a bunch of men being real.  Let's whip it out and let her rip.  Completely uncomfortable around the thought of any kind of a naked men's room kind of  a situation.  Yeah.  But underneath here...  Yeah, we're not seeing it under the console, so, yeah, make a mess.  Yes.  Rosebud frozen peas.  Full of country goodness and green penis.  Wait, that's terrible.  I quit.  Hey, it's time for more fad talk.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Why don't you come to my place? 
[05:34:00]  I'll show you my beefy bologna.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Poor demented honky.  Butt tag.  I need that, man.  Butt tag.  I'm being hammered.  Red over.  Head down.  Red over.  Head down.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hurry.  Is this a faggy show?  I'm just a flamin' fag.  Is this a faggy show? 
[05:34:30]  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody.  Give me the back, faggy.  Give me the back, faggy.  I'm horny.  Hurry.  Stick it in and start the bagging.  This is tearing the ass out of me.  Shut the hell up.  He's a flamin' fag.  I'll give you oral.  Put it in the mouth.  I always wanted those pipes.  Put it in the mouth.  You've got some funky-tasting stuff.  Fuck me.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Hell up. 
[05:35:00]  Hell up.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Get your bong off.  I-I-I-you.  Get your bong off.  Yeah, you sure is.  Oh my god.  You're just not in touch with your sensitive side, Anthony.  Hey!  You ever found monkey ass?  Opie.  Old hats gave Opie a boner.  Hey, what's up there, fruit dick?  What is your major malfunction, nut nut?  I just crap myself.  Lady chicken man at home.  Lady chicken man at home. 
[05:35:30]  Bag.  This is very funny.  Jesus Christ, this is despicable.  Harry sack with ya.  I like doin' aural on my jaw.  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom.  It's M202, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Dude, it's not like we have Zeppelin in the studio.  It's Lynch.  It should be good enough.  What?  Do what?  Nice.  That's your sound check.  Dude, I don't...  Four, one...  Oh, count?  One, two, three, four?  One, two...  All right.  Up or low? 
[05:36:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, well.  All right.  It's a Bible song.  All right, here it is.  Stephen Lynch.  It's about a little-known biblical character.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame.  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace. 
[05:36:30]  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God.  But Craig, don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's inside, we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine, but into Coco's light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas Crow.  I'm fuckin' Craig. 
[05:37:00]  I'm fuckin' Craig.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  Craig Christ.  I hang out with lepers, Barabbas, and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace. 
[05:37:30]  No, wait.  I already did that line.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna replay this a million times on our show.  You messed it up.  Oh, yeah.  I know what it is.  All right, God.  Jesus performs miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if it brought a fuckin' lady home.  Because while Jesus is prayin', fuckin' Craig is layin'. 
[05:38:00]  Every lady in the test of me, you know what I'm sayin'.  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin.  But if you've got a little sister, then there's room at this end.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  I'm fuckin' Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Jesus was our mother's faith. 
[05:38:30]  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry  When he's nailed to that tree.  And now the question for you  Is not what would Jesus do  But where will you be when the Craig machine comes partyin' through  And if the Lord would allow  You've got to ask yourself how and who and why  And when and where is your Messiah now  It's fuckin' Craig 
[05:39:00]  Craig  Fuckin' Craig  Fuckin' Craig  Fuckin' Craig  Craig Christ  Craig Christ  Craig Christ  I'm fuckin' Craig  Yeah, right on, man.  Woo!  Steven Lentz on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the end of the worst of Opie and Anthony.
