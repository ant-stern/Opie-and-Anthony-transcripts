<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy interview of Lisa Kennedy Montgomery, a former MTV VJ.  Kennedy recounted humorous anecdotes from her MTV days, including stories about working with various bands (No Doubt, Henry Rollins, Radiohead),  hosting Puck from *The Real World* at her family's Christmas (describing him as a "malignant narcissist"), and the challenges of the MTV environment.  She detailed her post-MTV career, including her work in talk radio and television, specifically mentioning a recent assignment for Stossel on Fox Business involving a cross-border trip into Mexico where she drove under the influence with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Kennedy also discussed her book, *The Kennedy Chronicles*, its nude cover photo, and stories within about Michael Jordan's gambling and her encounters with Kurt Cobain and Trent Reznor.  Interspersed were video clips, including one of a man cleaning a cobra enclosure. UFC president Dana White also guested, discussing the Chris Weidman/Anderson Silva fight and fighter reactions.  Jim Florentine promoted his podcast, *Comedy Metal Visions*.  Numerous commercial breaks punctuated this segment.

The show continued with a discussion about Anderson Silva's UFC loss and a detailed account of Meniere's disease from a guest who described their experience with the condition, including surgery and an experimental blood treatment in Dusseldorf, Germany (costing 7,500 Euros), a treatment also reportedly used by Alex Rodriguez and George Clooney.  This segment also prominently featured the farewell of a female intern, Sydney, with a cake and balloons, accompanied by playful, suggestive banter from the hosts.  Dean Norris and Betsy Brandt (*Breaking Bad*) were briefly in studio, discussing the show and their characters.  Further commercial breaks occurred throughout.


Following this, the show aired a longer interview with Dean Norris and Betsy Brandt, focusing initially on their emotional experiences filming *Breaking Bad*'s final scenes and their on-screen chemistry. The conversation shifted to their current projects, including Brandt's work with Michael J. Fox and Norris's role in *Under the Dome*, which Brandt described as creepy.  A significant portion then featured the Insane Clown Posse (ICP).  They discussed their history, independent business model, the "Gathering of the Juggalos" (featuring numerous nude attendees and a stone pig-shaped cell phone signal booster), their experiences with Eminem and Kid Rock, early career struggles, their pre-internet music distribution methods, current business operations (including a large staff and various production departments), and various odd jobs held before their musical success. Profanity was frequent throughout this interview.


Next, the show presented a segment with two guests, "Shaggy" and "Billy," followed by Anna Gunn. Shaggy and Billy recounted their impoverished childhoods, contrasting it with their later success in wrestling and music. They detailed early financial struggles, a manager who embezzled millions, living situations (including sharing an apartment with a transvestite), their career management, and the negative aspects of the wrestling world, mentioning conflicts with wrestlers like the Headbangers, but without specifics.  An unusual locker room rule—wrestlers fighting naked and greased up—was also mentioned.  Anna Gunn's interview focused on the audience's negative reaction to her *Breaking Bad* character, Skylar White, her character development, the dynamics with Walter White, and her future projects, including potential film roles and a *Breaking Bad* reunion. References to her *Seinfeld* appearances were also made. Jim Florentine concluded this portion with a rant against "man caves," using highly offensive language to characterize them as evidence of insufficient masculinity and unresolved mother/wife issues.

The final segment featured a recurring prank call bit, "Bobby Fletcher," calling a drug counseling center pretending to be a job applicant.  The main focus, however, remained a comedic interview mocking "man caves," relentlessly ridiculing the interviewee’s possessions (sports memorabilia, a pool table used for clothing storage, a recliner with beer holders, a kegerator, video games, and an autographed Derek Jeter baseball).  The hosts repeatedly asserted that man caves demonstrated a lack of masculinity and were retreats from wives' dominance.  The interview used crude language, escalating to homophobic slurs and insults. The host concluded by calling the interviewee a "pussy." The segment ended with the "Bobby Fletcher" prank call attempting to sell pot to the receptionist.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony show, call it the worst, wait it, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what's his name, face?  You know what time it is, it's the weekend.  And that means it's time for the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from ONA and after Opie and Anthony Live,  where we highlight the very best things that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony shows, and what a week of shows it was.  There's cast members from Breaking Bad in studio, Dana White from UFC in studio, the Insane Clown Posse in studio. 
[00:00:30]  But before we get to any of that, and I'll play it all for you, so keep it locked right here, Kennedy was in studio.  Do you remember Kennedy? I don't know if you were watching MTV from like, I don't know, 91, 92 to like 96, 95-ish.  Kennedy was the VJ. She was like the little quirky, rock, thick-rimmed glasses VJ.  She always had something going on with her hair and lipstick and all that stuff. 
[00:01:00]  Well, she was in studio and was a great guest.  She has a new book out now where she's talking all about her stories of her days at MTV, and she talked about it.  Apparently she was a virgin for a while.  She gets into that.  She talks about all the bands that she dealt with, a lot of inside stories.  Kennedy, a treat on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  How many years were you on there? 
[00:01:30]  Five and a half.  You were famous, man. Holy fuck.  You don't realize that now.  You were famous.  What do you mean you didn't realize?  Because I didn't watch MTV, and, you know, I would go places and just wear, you know, a wool cap, and when you wear glasses, people, you know, they don't recognize you.  Wow, really? People didn't recognize you?  If I had like big hair and, you know, purple lipstick, and I went to a rock show, like if I went to a Soul Asylum show, I was Madonna. 
[00:02:00]  Soul Asylum.  Runaway train.  Oh, good.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, so it was all like dependent on where you were and stuff and what you were wearing, yeah.  It was all contextual.  I don't know about that. I think you're downplaying it. MTV was huge back then.  But I didn't watch it, so I didn't know like how much we were on.  And, you know, we would go take BJ segments, and we would end up being on eight hours a day.  Right.  You know, it would take like a half hour to tape eight hours worth of programming, and you're on all day long. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  So, you know, kids come home from school, and that's all there was.  What were you doing before that?  Like, how'd you get the gig initially?  Well, I was doing radio. I was an intern at a radio station at K-Rock in L.A.  Yeah.  And then I used to Hector, my boss, every day, and be like, you should totally put me on the air. I'd be so fun.  And he's like, yeah, you can leave.  And then one day, the overnight guy quit.  Here's my shot.  Well, and then they hired Tammy Heide from Boston, who was like a huge jock in Boston, and then moved her to middays. 
[00:03:00]  And they didn't have anyone to do the overnights, and they were scrambling.  And this was a radio station that regularly put interns on the air.  It wasn't like, you know, I was this beacon and everyone else, you know, they were broadcasting icons.  Yeah.  Like, every other person who was on overnights had been fetching bagels earlier in the day.  Yeah.  And so I got a job a couple nights a week, and then I started working for Kevin and Bean in the morning.  And then my boss from the radio station went to MTV as a senior VP of programming. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  I got to do a VJ audition.  That works.  Yeah, it's great.  Good for you.  What is a VJ audition?  What do you have to do?  Just kind of throw to a song, or what do they have you do?  Yeah, I mean, it would be like a radio audition where, you know, you're essentially doing breaks and talking about music.  And you have to show that you know something about music and pop culture and try and be.  That's why I didn't get the gig, because I actually.  Did you audition?  I had an audition when we first moved to New York, yeah.  Do you have that tape?  Actually, it was for VH1.  I've been looking for this tape forever. 
[00:04:00]  I do not officially have the tape.  Oh, my God.  But I want that more than another angle on the JFK assassination.  I want that tape.  Me and Anthony were at Caroline's for a Stephen Lynch show, and one of the people from MTV slash VH1, you know, pulled me aside and said, come on in for an audition.  Yeah, there's a tape somewhere.  Oh, I'd love to see it.  I've never seen it, but I obviously did not get the gig.  In the 90s, there's no tape.  Really?  I actually had, like, MTV was really cool about this book, because they knew it wasn't going to be a salacious MTV tale, where I expose the dirt of the network and ruin them, finally. 
[00:04:30]  It was really, you know, an idealized first-person account, but they assigned me a PA who, you know, went and got as much tape as she could, but there were chapters, specific chapters, where I wanted the interviews.  Like, I wanted the No Doubt interview and Henry Rollins and Radiohead, and she couldn't find it.  Wow.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding.  They have to have them somewhere.  It's got to be somewhere.  Maybe she went through the first file cabinet one.  Yeah, no, no.  Maybe they were just going to find them. 
[00:05:00]  Maybe they were lazy over there.  How do you not save that stuff?  They have to.  Although, a lot of the Tonight Shows are lost, because they started taping over it.  Some of the oldest Carsons are lost, and they were just used over again and re-taped.  Right.  Well, they probably figured they did so many shows.  Yeah, who's going to care about this one?  Yeah, that Johnny Carson flash in the pan.  Well, you were at the end of the golden era of MTV, right?  It didn't go too much further after you, I don't think.  The music didn't know, and someone asked me yesterday, what do you think took the music 
[00:05:30]  out of MTV, and I think, you guys get so much food.  It's crazy.  You want some?  It's fantastic.  We try to eat healthy blueberries and oatmeal, you know.  Oh, that's wonderful.  We're like little Roman emperors.  We don't want to be fat DJs.  Is this a man with a lady hair going to feed you with his fingers?  That's a nice thing.  He's the intern.  We just don't even know his name.  I don't know what was it.  I think it was Chivo.  Taylor.  Yeah, something like that.  Who were some of the VJs after you?  I'm trying to remember.  Carson Daly.  Oh, Carson came after you. 
[00:06:00]  Carson and I overlapped.  Oh, right, of course, because TRL.  Right, okay.  But I think it was TRL, because when they realized that they could play 10 seconds of a video,  and that's all they had to play, they were like, how about we play no seconds?  So someone probably, you know, put that out there in a meeting, and everyone went, yeah.  You know what?  But that shit was so frustrating, because some of those songs were pretty hot, and you wanted  to kind of see the whole video.  And there's Carson Daly.  I'm like, no, I want to see more of the video.  That was, you're like, no, it wasn't. 
[00:06:30]  That was a quarter of it.  Not even.  Didn't the real world hurt it, too?  Just the tip.  Yeah, yeah, just the tip.  They just put in the tip.  A little bit.  The real world, too, right?  Because that kind of changed their programming a lot.  Yeah, and that was 92.  So that debuted in 92 before I got there, and there was a lot of controversy about that  show.  And, you know, people were like, ooh, it's fake, it's, you know, or it's really dangerous,  and you shouldn't be showing people like this.  Yeah, I do remember the controversy.  Everything's controversial.  Yeah, everyone has to make something out of it. 
[00:07:00]  I remember when Survivor debuted, and they're like, oh, people are going to die.  They're going to die.  Is this what we should be having people do?  It's kind of a gutter.  We're putting people on exhibit.  All right.  Put up, relax.  But the early real worlds, that was real reality shows.  Way more so.  Way more than now.  Now it's ridiculous.  Everything's a storyline.  You watch any reality show, and everything is so forced and pre-produced, and it's because  no one wants to sit there and go through 24 hours of footage. 
[00:07:30]  I read, I think it took six months to get a real world.  They had to be in a house for six months.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And nowadays, they're barely there three weeks to film a whole season.  It's called assisted reality now.  Right.  Assisted reality.  Okay, so we're going to do group anal at three, and then you guys are going to get loaded,  and you're going to vomit on yourselves by 4.30, and we need a heart out here.  Yeah, the fight will be a good ending for this one.  On Pedro and Puck.  I mean, come on. 
[00:08:00]  That shit was great.  Okay, in the book, I talk about taking Puck home to Portland, because I had interviewed  him for a late night hug.  Did he punch you?  Did he wipe a booger on you?  I broke my wrist, and I blame it on him.  You know what he did?  He wounded my family with his inane, boring stories.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  To be a body owner.  And my parents are Midwesterners, and they don't understand that sort of malignant narcissism  that just takes over, and he just blanketed them with stink, and stories of his friend, 
[00:08:30]  the orangutan trainer.  So he was such an ass that by the end of the two or three days, my brothers and I were like,  let's pretend we're on the real world.  And my brother was like, I'll be Muhammad, you be Rachel.  And they were like, Puck, you can play yourself.  And he started crying.  Really?  And he was like, this is so mean.  I don't know why you guys are doing this.  Yeah, he got all emotional.  What the fuck?  Why did you have him at the house? 
[00:09:00]  Because he convinced me he had nowhere to go for Christmas.  And my mom was like, well, honey, just bring him here.  Oh, no.  We'll have such a nice time.  We'll just have some Bosco, and we'll open presents, and we'll have a birthday cake for Jesus.  You know what, it's wonderful.  Did she regret that?  Oh, she still does.  She brings it up.  Yeah, she's like, who's that rock or pick?  What was his name?  He was awful.  He brought that fuck to your house.  And then I went to, I'm the only person in my family who ever went to church. 
[00:09:30]  And so I was going to church on Christmas, and Puck's like, you should take me.  And I'm like, I don't think that's a good idea.  Like, I think that you will catch on fire if you walk into a church.  And he wore lederhosen.  Really?  Like, what?  Yes.  And I was too tired.  I had a broken wrist, and I didn't want to fight.  And I was already exhausted.  And I was like, yeah.  He's got to always, it was always making everything about him, yeah.  It was making it difficult.  And so now when I go back home, there are all these Greeks that come up to me like, why 
[00:10:00]  did you bring Puck in later?  Oh, my God, still.  Why did you do this?  Why?  Still.  I guess.  Wow.  What happened to Puck?  He's an ass.  You know what he is now?  He's like, allegedly, in the recesses of my memory, a wife-beating, drunken driver who  got a DUI with his kid in the car.  Yeah.  And then.  I mean, he's done some things.  It's like, you're such.  And like, I contemplated not writing about him because of the horrible things he's  done just in the last five years.  I have heard, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  I love this.  There's domestic violence, a restraining order, a DUI, yeah.  Yeah.  Just really.  With a kid in the car.  With a kid in the car.  It's like, you know what?  Go get bombed and drive off a cliff.  Right.  That's fine.  Without the kid.  Without the kid.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Was he mean to you on that?  Was he mean to your family or just a boob?  He was a boob.  I mean, he tried to be like, woo, this is me.  And my family was like, yeah, we're kind of over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm not really impressed by you at all.  So what did you end up doing after MTV? 
[00:11:00]  I moved to Seattle.  So I fell in love with my boyfriend in 95.  And then in 97, my contract was up in December.  And I knew that I wanted to leave.  Like, I didn't want to be the person who stayed at the party too long.  Oh, yeah.  And I was worried that if I signed another deal, like, that's all I would ever do.  But there was still that risk anyway.  Like, even if I stayed there.  So my boyfriend at the time, he's now my husband.  I love you, Dave.  He has satellite in his truck. 
[00:11:30]  He broke his back.  Wow.  And so I had just finished shooting at the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach.  I had a great day.  And his friend called me frantically.  And they're like, Dave just broke his back.  He's in an ambulance.  He might be paralyzed.  Jeez.  And it was like, holy shit.  Jesus.  Jeez.  So I went up to Portland, where he was.  And he had major back surgery.  And, you know, they were like, well, he might be paralyzed after the surgery.  And you realize in that moment when someone's really hurt that you love, you realize how much you love him, how much you love them. 
[00:12:00]  And he looked at me and he was like, I don't want you to be my girlfriend.  I want to marry you.  I'm like, I'm moving to Seattle.  And so I did.  So I moved to Seattle.  And we bought a house on Lake Washington.  And it was really great.  And we'd play mini golf.  And then I had to start working, because that doesn't pay for itself.  And then I started doing talk radio in Seattle.  Oh, that's right.  You are in the business.  I know that.  Okay.  And you're still doing that?  I do.  I did talk radio for years.  Now I do a music show in the morning in L.A. 
[00:12:30]  You were successful doing talk radio.  Of course.  I know that.  That was really fun.  I love talk.  And I still fill in on KFI for John and Ken and stuff like that.  And that's great.  I mean, that is such a focused challenge.  It's like anything other than a four-hour show where you're talking alone without taking  phone calls.  It's super easy compared to all that.  I mean, I think so many people in our world would have loved to be on MTV to actually walk  away from that.  I can't imagine.  Did you feel like they were going to want you to leave? 
[00:13:00]  Or did you feel like I have to walk away?  She easily could have done another few years.  No, I think I could have stayed.  But to make that decision going, I'm walking away from MTV.  It was very anxiety-inducing.  I can imagine.  And I talk about it in the books, like having panic attacks.  Like, I'm leaving everything I know.  Like, everything I know professionally and socially.  My roommate worked at MTV.  We were roommates for five years.  She was an executive at MTV.  You know, I met, I didn't meet my boyfriend through MTV, but he was so wrapped up in that 
[00:13:30]  world.  And all I knew professionally and socially was there.  You know, not to mention being on TV and wondering, like, maybe I'm never going to work  in broadcasting again.  Like, that was the next possibility.  Did you ever regret it?  Was there a time, like, after, like, two or three years later, you were like, oh, fuck.  No.  No, I really liked being in Seattle.  I was more surprised at the blowback I got politically trying to get jobs outside of MTV and people  being like, yeah.  When I wrote, I wrote a book for, an advice book for girls in 99 and had a hard time finding 
[00:14:00]  a publisher.  Because you're not going to believe this, but publishers in New York are very liberal.  Wow.  And so they were like, oh, she's the Republican.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  And so that was difficult.  But other than that, you know, I've always tried to do kind of fun, interesting stuff.  And so I did a game show on Game Show Network.  And I did a show.  I did Pitchman on Discovery Channel.  And I'm a correspondent for Stossel on Fox Business.  And he's amazing.  Stossel.  Yeah.  Because he's a full-on libertarian and sends me to do, like, these great stories. 
[00:14:30]  And I climbed over the border fence into Mexico a couple weeks ago.  I drove drunk with the L.A. County Sheriff.  I mean, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department got me drunk.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we drove around the cones.  And I just went to Detroit and hung out with urban farmers.  Oh, man.  It was fantastic.  Urban farmers.  It's an urban farmer.  It's like beekeepers and stuff who are squatting on city land in Detroit, growing kale.  And they have chickens and bees and all this stuff. 
[00:15:00]  And, you know, it's like hippies with beards.  Like, yeah, man.  It's like Thunderdome, Detroit.  It is.  That's why it's so great.  Like, stop trying to make it Chicago.  Like, let the earth swallow the sea hole.  Let it just be, right?  Barter town.  Yes.  And then let it become this strange agrarian, like, neo-libertarian experiment of awesomeness.  Oh, that's wild.  Yeah.  Did that piece run yet?  I want to see that.  Yeah, that was last week.  All right, I'll look it up online.  Did you go by the bees at all?  I did.  I walked by the bees.  And I was like, am I going to get stung? 
[00:15:30]  Because this would be cool.  Like, maybe Detroit bees are, like, even harder.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  There's no idea you'd get stung?  What's that?  I would never walk by a beehive.  Ever.  Really?  It wasn't high.  I mean, they're, like, in boxes.  Yeah, I know.  You just sort of buzz around.  But there's always a few on the outside of the boxes.  Yeah.  There's got to be one ornery one.  Yeah, there's a few that just don't want to be in the box.  Yeah, they were buzzing.  It's like pit bulls.  Right.  You know, everyone says, oh, no, my dog is so sweet and nice.  Until he's latching onto a toddler's throat.  Right.  But, you know, there's still a few dogs.  Those beekeepers that don't even wear the suits.  They're just out there and bees are on their hand and they go, meh. 
[00:16:00]  And they're like this.  Yeah, they're just brushing them off.  If I see a bee and I'm not, like, vigilant.  They look like Rocky Dennis.  They've got, like, cauliflower face.  Yes.  Yeah.  If I'm not vigilant, though, around a bee, one will just go, meh, and just fly right  into me stinger first.  Yeah.  And they're just, like, meh, wiping them off.  They're just assholes.  Meh.  Fuck.  I say to you.  Relax.  Yeah, they're like the frustrated accountants of the animal world.  Yes.  So I was watching a special on Japanese hornets and there was a guy catching them with no 
[00:16:30]  gloves.  And those are the biggest hornets in the world.  They're horrible.  They're horrible bees.  And he was just catching them in a little net and then whispering them into a honey jar  and, like, making them drown so he could make this special potent honey.  Oh, yeah, because it's probably some, like, wiener elixir.  Yeah.  What a prick.  Yeah.  Did you see the video on YouTube?  This is my favorite guy cleaning the poop in the cobra cage?  No.  Yes.  That's insane.  Oh.  Yes.  We would play it.  He's, like, in a cobra pen and he's just, like, cleaning up the cobra poop. 
[00:17:00]  Like, it's nothing.  And he's got, like, 20.  And they're all, like, 20 doing that cobra thing.  Yeah.  Making the zombie sound from Walking Dead.  They're all, like, whew.  And he doesn't even think twice about it.  He's, like, yeah, it's just my job.  Who cares?  Yeah.  He's, like, bite me.  Right.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  I make four cents a day.  We're in Indonesia.  Right.  Eat a bag of dicks.  All of you.  It's fucked up.  You're naked on the cover of your book there, Kennedy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Side nude.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  In my life.  And I should add.  My daughter's, like, why are you naked? 
[00:17:30]  And I was, like, I'm not.  I'm wearing a bodysuit.  Oh, God.  It looks like I'm naked, doesn't it?  And my eight-year-old's, like, you know, about that whole bodysuit thing.  That's naked.  I can see your tattoo and your side boobie.  And I was, like, oh, yeah.  They do that.  It's called Photoshop.  Yeah.  They Photoshopped it in.  Yeah.  But mommy's not naked.  I should add looking good, by the way.  It's not cool to just say you're naked.  Oh, yeah.  It's great show.  I want to add looking good, too, by the way.  That's from 1994.  You're on a mule.  Yeah.  Very good.  You're the first person who got that.  Because everyone's, like, you know.  Darky?  I feel bad for the horse. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  That's not a horse.  That's a mule, man.  Look.  Yeah.  You can see his little funny head.  Yeah.  What was the photo shoot for?  It was for Us Magazine.  Mark Seliger took that.  And so the mock-up that they did at the publishing company was the least attractive photo you've ever seen of any human being.  Right.  So they found some free, horrible photo of me where my face looks, I mean, from the picture, it looks like I'm making this sound.  Eee!  Like, and it would be repellent. 
[00:18:30]  If you saw that in a bookstore, and I gave it to my husband, he's like, oh, hell no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, I would actively walk away.  I would walk out of the bookstore if I saw it.  So then my editor was like, we need a picture from the 90s.  I'm like, I must have taken one good photo.  And then I remembered that with Mark Seliger.  And so I just called his studio, like, cold call him and been like, hi.  Right.  You don't know me because you're 12.  But back in 1994, I took a great picture with Mark, and I was wondering if I could use it for my book.  And he let me, and that makes him awesome. 
[00:19:00]  That's awesome.  Absolutely.  I didn't realize this was from 94.  You have an age there, Kennedy.  You're very kind.  I'm serious.  You look good, man.  That's pretty nice.  So what's going to be in, what's in this book, I should say?  We should try to sell some books today.  Oh, you're so kind.  So the Michael Jordan story.  Right.  He's a big gambler, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I knew when I pulled out the dice.  Right.  It was on.  Right.  Did you get to see him, you know, gambling?  I gambled with him.  But I mean, like, the big numbers?  Like, he would lose it.  The big numbers was my lady cherry. 
[00:19:30]  Like, that was it.  That was what we were gambling for.  Because I was like, do you want me to go get $400, which was the most I could take out  of the ATM?  I'm basic cable.  He was pushing millions, man.  He would lose millions.  That's what I said.  Like, he would lose my salary in an hour.  Yes, on one hand of blackjack in any given casino.  And play some blackjack, but Jordan's got you beat.  Oh, please.  Of course he does.  And goes pretty high.  He's a little nutty with it. 
[00:20:00]  Do you play, like, three hands at once?  Oh, yeah.  That stuff.  I mean, that's crazy.  Yeah, three hands.  He's just confident.  Max bet on all three.  Yeah.  Double down, splitting on me.  He's in the high roller room.  Before you know it, it's like...  He's up there.  You got, like, a lot of cash on me.  Are you good?  I mean, what's your lifetime average?  Have you made more than you've lost?  Yeah, I absolutely think I've made more than I've lost.  Okay.  Yeah.  I've had some pretty bad beef.  Every gambler says that, though.  Yeah, but...  My dad never would tell us when he'd lose.  So I'm calling you out on that.  I won 60 grand this weekend in Reno.  No, I talk about when I lose. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you're going, oh, that wasn't good.  That wasn't good.  You really think you're up?  Yeah, I think I am.  I think so.  Do you think he's bluffing?  I don't...  Have you ever thought of an intervention?  I know, right?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  You want to start a couple of different things?  Please.  Why?  Why?  Do I think he's lying?  No, I think he might be...  I think he's right around there.  I think he's right around...  I think I'm doing all right.  ...even or a little up.  I think he might tell the truth.  I think I'm a little up.  Even if you're a little up, that's way ahead, because there's some people who've like... 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everything.  Terrible.  Here's the cobra video.  Oh.  For reference.  Oh, he's right there with him.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  He's just throwing him out.  Yeah, he's just throwing him out.  Because he needs to get to that area of the pen.  Look at that one.  It's like striking.  He's like...  And look at the one over on the right.  I thought you've seen this video.  I have.  I'm amazed by it.  No, I mean these guys.  No, I never saw this one.  Why does he put them nicely?  Yeah, all of them behind me.  What?  Is those some eggs?  Do we have sound?  I want to hear the horrible sound of these things. 
[00:21:30]  Where's he getting at?  Walking Dead zombies.  Yeah, the...  Oh, those are eggs.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he just sweeps them away.  And look what he's wearing.  He's not even wearing shoes.  He's got flip-flop.  What the fuck?  He's got flip-flop.  I just want to be in a suit of armor.  Right.  This is craziness.  What an asshole.  Just sweeping them up.  What is his little broom?  He's got a dumb little homemade broom.  I wouldn't do that if they were rubber snakes.  Yeah, a stick with bristles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the snakes behind him? 
[00:22:00]  He's not even looking behind him.  Oh, my God.  Get the hell out of here.  It struck at him.  He didn't even flinch.  Then he does this freaky-deaky shaman thing in the snake's face.  He didn't even flinch when that thing struck at him.  That's crazy.  Well, if he put them nicely, they probably wouldn't hate him so much, but he throws them.  He throws them like they're rubber.  That guy's a dick.  Like they're hoses.  Fuck God.  Why aren't they biting him?  This guy's magic.  Best sound ever.  That, if I heard that once...  Of course.  Look, he's right next to the one that's cut back, ready to hit him. 
[00:22:30]  Lecturing him.  Look at all of them.  There's like 50 of them ready to strike.  I can't even believe this.  The poop and the eggs.  Like, Bernard, you're such a dick.  You come in here every day.  Look at all their little heads.  Look at them all there.  They're all pissed off.  Like, each of us could kill you 10 times.  Look at them.  They're all pissed off.  Like, did this guy just throw us?  Did this guy?  How dare he?  Yeah.  This guy's an asshole.  Look at that.  That's a great video.  I am amazed by this guy.  And there are a few behind him, and he knows they're not going to sneak up and get him. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  And this is actually my video from Detroit.  Ah, that's...  Yeah.  All right.  Tell us about the book.  Come on.  I'm amazed.  Let's sell some books.  All right.  Let's sell some books.  Come on, people.  It's like a telethon.  Hallelujah.  We're cured cancer.  The book, actually, it leads to virility.  It's known that if you read this book, you will have an eight-hour erection.  That's nice.  Also known as priapism.  Oh.  Oh.  It's very tantric.  Oh, that's when the boner doesn't go down.  Yeah.  Then you've got to go somewhere, and they hit it with a mallet.  Oh. 
[00:23:30]  What is a fucking cartoon character?  That is painful.  Kennedy, what's your name?  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  That's a fucking fancy name.  Well, my parents wanted to call me Kennedy, but my dad, who just thought,  left with me, was like, she's not going to be able to spell it.  Oh.  Let's just call her Lisa.  Oh, no.  Like every other girl born in the 70s.  Lisa. 
[00:24:00]  How did your boyfriend at the time break his back?  In a motocross race.  So he was a pro snowboarder for 10 years.  And, you know, it's like, yeah, the smartest thing you can do when you're a snowboarder,  like, let me get on a motorcycle and race other dudes.  So he flew off a jump and landed on his butt and just burst one of the vertebrae.  And he was very lucky, very lucky he was not paralyzed because he was for a little bit.  And then, being a genius, a year and a half later, he was at a snowboard contest in California. 
[00:24:30]  And I will not forgive him for this one.  He decided to be the first one off a jump in a big air contest and overshot the landing by about 40 feet and just fell out of the air and broke his back again.  Wow.  Second time in two years?  Yeah.  Jesus.  And that's every once in a while, like, you know how it is when you're in a relationship, like, you ruminate on something, you let it go, and then you just bring it up out of nowhere.  Yeah, right.  Like, that's the one.  That's my thing.  I'm like, why did you do that?  And still to this day, and that was in 1998. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  But I'm like, why would you do that?  Of course.  Yeah.  How's his back now?  It's funny because his back's good, but now he has a hernia.  He's got it, like, he surfs, he skateboards, he snowboards all the time.  But he's got a hernia.  And so the other day, like, something popped out of it.  Wow.  And so, and the hernia's, like, right by the groin.  And so he's out with our daughter.  They're on a walk in the neighborhood.  And he's got his hands down his pants. 
[00:25:30]  And he's, like, trying to poke it back in.  And he realizes, like, he looks like a total pervert.  Oh, my God.  And so he's, like, trying to wrangle our very active four-year-old.  And he's like, we've got to go.  We've got to go.  Oh, my God.  Someone's going to call the police.  Oh, my God.  All right, sicko.  He's toying with himself.  Yes, exactly.  He's in his pants.  What's he do for work?  Is he a professional snowboarder?  He owns a snowboard company.  Okay.  So he actually has a snowboard factory in Huntington Beach, California.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Which is so amazing.  That's awesome.  Wait a minute.  California is a shithole for regulation in small business. 
[00:26:00]  Like, it is impossible to have a small business there.  And it would be so easy to either have your boards made in China or go over the border and do them in Mexico.  But they have stayed not only in the U.S. but in California.  Wow.  Which makes them a punk rocker.  Good for them.  Why are they so shitty with small businesses?  Because of the regulation and the taxes.  And now with Obamacare, Obamacare will kill small businesses.  Yeah.  Small businesses now will not have incentive to grow.  And that is absolutely true.  Obamonomics will destroy this country.  Well, that's not what I hear on the news.  Oh, no. 
[00:26:30]  It's wonderful.  Yay.  We should have more education, too, for everyone.  And houses in a living wage.  Unions are awesome.  Look what they did to Detroit.  It's perfect.  I love it.  Yeah.  You should have that everywhere.  Very cool.  I love it.  Johnny Resnick from the Goo Goo Dolls wrote a number one song about me.  Which one?  Which one?  Name?  That's about you?  Yeah.  No kidding.  And I made him admit it.  I did a modern-day interview with a lot of people in the book, like Pat Smear from Nirvana, 
[00:27:00]  who told me something I didn't know was that Dave Grohl started writing Foo Fighters music long before Kirk died.  I believe that.  Yeah.  I believe that.  And Pat told me that he was walking, they were in the studio rehearsing, and he walked  past Dave's car, and Dave was playing this music kind of, like, jamming in his own car,  and Pat kind of surprised him, and he turned it down and was like, uh-uh.  And so Pat's like, oh, that's great.  Have you written some stuff you're going to bring into the studio for all of us?  And Dave's like, oh, man, this is my new side project. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, shit.  And that was Foo Fighters, and that was before Kirk died.  So I was surprised to learn that.  The interview with Pat is really great.  And then-  Wait, I'm going to slow you down a little bit.  You met Kurt Cobain, obviously?  Yes.  What kind of guy was he?  From my point of view, a very annoyed one, because I think he was one of those people who  was genuinely annoyed by me.  And he actually prank called me one night.  Really?  Yeah.  But he seems like he was annoyed by everyone.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, I wouldn't take it personally.  But he would actively roll his eyes when I would walk in a room. 
[00:28:00]  He'd be like, uh-  What was his problem with you?  I was, you know, I represented corporate music.  Oh, yeah.  Then don't do corporate music.  Well, that was the argument that Rob Tannenbaum made when they wrote their book, I Want My MTV,  was, you know, Nirvana was a very MTV-friendly band.  It didn't feel like that from the inside, because getting them to do stuff,  felt like pulling teeth.  But they were all over him.  But they did unplugged.  Thank you.  They did special concerts.  A lot of interviews. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I mean, they didn't come to the beach house.  Oh, but you say, well, then don't do corporate rock.  I think he pretty much stopped doing it.  When you look at it that way, it's like, well, he pretty much took the big exit.  He didn't puss out.  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  You know what?  You're completely right.  Yeah, but he was in there for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he was all over.  They chose to make videos.  They did, and Pearl Jam did not.  After Jeremy, Pearl Jam would not make videos.  Right, really.  I mean, that was a band, and Pearl Jam is still one of the biggest bands in the world. 
[00:29:00]  I love Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  Still a big fan.  Their live show is phenomenal.  I finally got to see him for the first time, even though I've been a fan forever, in Philly  last summer.  Unbelievable.  How was the end of the show?  I snuck out.  Who needs to see Jay-Z do 99 Problems with Eddie Vedder?  That's just sweet shit.  Get out of here.  I saw Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder do the Temple of the Dog song.  Wow.  I'm going home.  Home dog.  Yeah.  Which is, by the way, one of the worst songs ever written.  Really?  I kind of like it.  I hated that one. 
[00:29:30]  Really?  Come on.  I would turn it.  Chris Cornell's shrill, shrieking.  I'm going home.  I'm going home.  Repeat that line, Chris.  I'm going home.  I'm going high like a woman who's being sexually assaulted.  Go ahead.  Horrible.  That was an awful little tune.  So the Goo Goo Dolls do Name.  How did that come about?  How do they decide to do a song about you?  I don't know that song.  Can we hear some of it?  Oh, my God.  It's like, I'm sorry. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, it's massive.  You can hide beside me.  Maybe for a while.  I won't tell no one your name.  I won't tell them your name.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Wing-a-ding-a-ding-a.  I inspired this song.  Why?  Tell me the story.  Okay, so Goo Goo Dolls come to the MTV studio.  Right.  I loved their record, Superstar Car Wash.  I thought it was a great record.  That was before they hit.  Yeah.  And they had done a song with Paul Westerberg. 
[00:30:30]  And there weren't.  And this was...  But a lot of people love the fucking album.  Yeah, so I love that.  I love that record.  So they came in, and I had made fun of bands in the past, and Johnny thought I was going  to make fun of them, but instead I was very effusive.  And he was kind of caught off guard and really hot.  Like, he had these working-class Polish biceps, and he was wearing, like, a cut-off shirt and  overalls and, you know, frosted hair and, you know, all the ingredients right there.  So, you know, we kind of had a flirtation. 
[00:31:00]  And then he was like, we should go to dinner and talk about music.  I'm like, that's a great idea.  And he was newly married.  Like, he had only been married for, like, a year.  So he came over to my apartment, and, you know, we talked for a while.  We went and had soup at Veselka, which is a Russian deli down the street from where I  lived in the East Village.  And then we went back to my apartment afterward, which was, you know, always the fatal mistake.  Like, and it's late, and it's dark, and my roommate wasn't there, and he leaned in and  kissed me.  And I was like, ha-ha. 
[00:31:30]  And it was, like, a beautiful, like, life-changing electric bolts in the vagina kiss.  And I pulled back, and I was like, dude, I can't do this.  You are married.  And he's like, okay, we'll just lay down on the couch and watch TV.  And I'll rub my penis on your backside.  We'll dry hump.  We'll dry hump.  This is a new kind of mousse.  Sorry.  Let it, just rub it into your hair.  It'll make it extra shiny.  Right?  And open your mouth and close your eyes.  So we did.  Like, we just, I laid with my head in his lap on the couch. 
[00:32:00]  And that was, it was like a really strong emotional connection that we never acted on.  And then he writes the song name.  Then he wrote the song, yeah.  Holy fuck, that's a cool story.  And they were broke before this song hit.  Like, they were going to break up, like, on food stamps broke.  And then they got this song played, and it became huge.  And they were considered a punk band, more or less, right?  Yeah.  They were a lot harder than what...  They were from Buffalo, and it was like kind of punk metal.  Yeah.  And they were on Metal Blade Records.  And then when they switched to Warner Brothers.  Right.  And started writing, you know, vagina music like this. 
[00:32:30]  But I always liked him.  I love, I have a total pop sensibility, and I love pop songs.  Right.  I, you know, that's why I thought Metallica was such a great band.  Because Metallica writes great pop songs.  Absolutely.  And then he admitted in the book that he wrote the song about it.  That's cool, man.  Is he still married to the same woman?  No.  He recently...  No.  No.  No, and I actually, when, because you, you know, you go through a vetting process with  a lawyer to make sure no one's going to sue you when they read the book. 
[00:33:00]  And, uh, and it was funny, the stuff they flagged.  They flagged a story about Matt LeBlanc.  But with Johnny Resnick, they're like, you can't write these things.  If he was married at the time, he can sue you.  So I had to take a lot of the more explicit stuff out.  Wow.  So.  Mmm.  And then there's, you know, there was a love triangle with Courtney Love and Trent Reznor.  With you?  Well, I copped trance balls one night.  And that was, that was about as far as it went.  That's, uh.  So we were in a club on, on Halloween. 
[00:33:30]  It wasn't.  They were lukewarm.  It was, it almost put me off Men for Life.  Wow.  Like, at that point, I was like, you know what?  Maybe I am a lesbian.  I don't need this.  No.  And so I was kissing him and Richard Patrick, who is the guitarist.  Sure.  Nine Inch Nails.  He became the singer of Filter.  Right.  So I was making out with both of them at a club and on Halloween in the West Village.  And, uh, and I really wanted to be making out with Rich, because he was a great kisser.  And, and so I interviewed Richard Patrick for the book, and he was like, yeah, no, I totally  wasn't into you.  Oh, man. 
[00:34:00]  In the book, I was like, he could have been my first, and I loved him, and it was love  at first sight.  And he's like, yeah, no, not really.  Yeah.  Not too.  So you're creepy.  You were a virgin when you started working on MTV?  I guess.  And so?  Your husband's your first?  Yeah.  And you're only?  Yeah.  No kidding.  Wow.  I mean, I, I, I did other, like, shower-y, you know, rubbing with the soap and whatnot.  I'm right.  But you're your actual only sexual partner for real?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's amazing.  You never hear that.  But see, I don't have any comparison. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, man.  I think it would be harder if, if, A, that he was, you know, if he had a, a Twizzler wiener,  and if he, uh, if he was bad at it, but he's fantastic.  Oh.  And he's really hot, and he's, like, super muscular, and, oh, man.  Yeah, and he loves me.  He's really awesome.  You guys have been together a long time.  Yeah, 18 years.  Wow.  That's a long time.  Anyway, we could talk forever.  Kennedy, thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Come back and see us.  You have a show to do, and I wish you luck.  Yes.  Luck at this point.  Jesus.  We were discussing Rodman, Eric just told me, on North Korea. 
[00:35:00]  We were talking about Dennis Rodman.  Oh, really?  Look into his face.  Dennis?  No one talks about, like, something is wrong with his face.  It looks like he's been in a radiation accident, and wears, like, an inch of old lady makeup  to cover it.  Yes.  There's something going on with him.  Oh, really?  And maybe it's the rampant alcoholism that's well-documented.  Well, that could be it, yeah.  He loves his, uh, his booze.  He loves it.  All right, guys.  You're great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The book is called The Kennedy Chronicles.  It's out now. 
[00:35:30]  Go get it.  That's it.  Or you can buy it on a Kindle if you want to.  Kindle, Amazon.  Kindle.  You guys can even link to the Amazon page on your website.  I don't even mind.  Wow, that would be crazy.  I would even be mad.  Erock, just link her book on our Facebook page.  Yeah, come on, Erock.  What's wrong with you?  Thank you, Erock.

Worst of the Week countdown with me, Sam Roberts from Opie & Anthony and after Opie & Anthony Live, 
[00:40:30]  highlighting the great things that happened this week on the Opie & Anthony Show.  We're still going to get to all those Breaking Bad cast members.  I know I keep promising, but I promise you we will get to it.  I promise you we'll get to saying goodbye to the intern.  I promise you we will get to the insane clown posse.  But in the meantime, let's do Dana White right now.  Dana White, the president of the UFC.  Very few billionaires come in here, CEOs, and just hang with Opie & Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Dana White is one of the coolest company owners in the world because he says what's on his mind.  He's not afraid of anything.  Dana White stops by.  Always a great guest on the Opie & Anthony Show.  Number five.  The last time I saw you was I went to the Silva fight, and I saw you there.  What a fucking...  I've never been so shocked in my life at what happened.  It was crazy, wasn't it?  It was...  Do you think you can't be surprised by anything?  I literally stood there with my fucking mouth open. 
[00:41:30]  But we were talking about that before the show, too,  because someone was in here and said a lot of the fighters said that he had a shot against Silva.  Well, Chael had said that to me.  Right.  Oh, you were the one who said that?  Yeah.  Okay, right.  But you said that Chael said a bunch of the other fighters were also saying,  don't assume that Silva's got this.  Chael said that to me.  We saw each other in the restroom.  And, you know, after complimenting, he said, like, men will do.  I was like, what do you think?  And he goes, I'm picking Weidman.  And he goes, and a lot of the fighters are picking Weidman.  Right.  And I had asked Dana about that.  I said, like, hey, Chael said that a lot of the fighters are picking Weidman. 
[00:42:00]  Now, do you think they're picking him, or is that like –  and what I was saying was, do you think that these are guys who have lost to him  or don't like him, just kind of want to –  I was wondering if it was more wishful thinking than anything.  You thought I had heard about some internet conspiracy thing, which I had not heard.  But I was surprised that all these fighters were picking him.  And I'm like, do they just hate Silva and want to see him lose?  Or they really believed it?  Yeah, no, people were saying, because as the lead-up for that fight  and all these fighters were picking him, you know,  he came back into my locker room that night, and he's like, come on. 
[00:42:30]  And he's like, I mean, all these guys are saying –  you know, I thought you were saying that, like, we were telling fighters to say,  you know, Anderson Silva would win the fight.  But no, I mean, we don't tell anybody to say that.  They pick what they pick.  And a lot of – I was saying, you know, when he and I were talking off air  that a lot of the – like, George St. Pierre.  George St. Pierre absolutely knew that Weidman was going to win the fight.  He wouldn't even schedule a fight.  Like, no, I'm not going to do a super fight with Anderson because he's not going to win. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  Yeah, literally what he said.  So he wouldn't even talk about booking a fight.  That's how much he believed in Weidman.  Wow.  Yeah, see, I thought – I was like – because I heard it from Chael, who I like,  but I'm like, Chael has a thing for Silva.  I'm like, I wonder if that's just guys wanting to see him fall because they're sick and tired.  Like, you know what I mean?  If I see a comic who I know is good about to – I'm like, if he bombs, I'm so fucking happy.  Like, I wonder if that's the same.  But, man, they knew something because Faber had picked, I think, Weidman, a lot of guys picked him.  And you don't think Silva's done, right?  No. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he's got a few more.  Yeah, that – the rematch is going to be interesting.  Yes.  You know, obviously I think if Weidman wins the rematch, you know, maybe Anderson would retire,  but who knows?  You've got to do a Don King and make sure Weidman loses the second fight so you get the third fight.  Oh, God, don't even start that.  That's what everybody – that'll be the next thing.  It's a no-lose for the UFC in the weird way that, like, if Weidman wins –  Everyone's going to be watching it.  He's legendary.  And if Anderson wins, then it's like, okay, A, you've got a third fight, and B, it's like, oh, okay, he was – 
[00:44:00]  You sure don't need the third fight.  It would be – you know, if it happens, it happens.  But everyone's going to be watching the rematch.  It's already set up all nice.  Yeah, and you talk about a third fight depending on how the fight goes.  You know what I mean?  It's like everybody – Anderson Silva's 38 years old.  A lot of people don't realize that.  But if he went out there and looked like, you know, he just showed up and was old all of a sudden, it'd be one thing.  But he didn't look old.  It's the way that he lost.  He was out there goofing around.  Like, wasn't that crazy in the arena that night?  Like, at first, when he got knocked out, the whole place was in shock. 
[00:44:30]  Like, he said, everybody was sitting there with – and then the place just went crazy.  Well, I started – you know, I love Anderson Silva.  And I start – as I'm watching it and he's doing that, it looked like fucking – when Weidman had him on the ground in the beginning.  It looked like he was – I guess I'm going to guess a heel hook or whatever he was going for.  And I'm like, Silva might be in trouble early.  And I'm like, what – I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  I'm like, don't listen to him.  I was yelling to Weidman, don't listen.  He's in your fucking head.  I was getting annoyed at Silva for taunting him.  I'm like, man, you better take this guy seriously.  Silva's always been great at that. 
[00:45:00]  I love that about him.  Yeah, Roy Jones Jr. jumped up after the first round and started screaming at me, this fight's over.  He's in his head.  It's over.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and then that second round came out.  People were going crazy during that fight.  Like, all the people that were on the side of the cage there were going nuts.  Yeah, I couldn't believe – and I rooted for Weidman in that moment because I got so annoyed at Silva for doing that.  I'm like, what are you doing, man?  This guy's a real fucking problem.  Yeah, I think everybody did.  I mean, even Brazilians that were booing him on the way in were cheering him on the way out.  No kidding. 
[00:45:30]  Do you think that's humiliating for Silva to lose that way?  Yeah.  Not just to get beaten by a guy but to be clowning around like that?  Of course it is, right?  That's humiliating to lose, period, that way.  I mean, when you've never lost and you're the best in the world and you get knocked out, yeah, that always sucks.  It's never fun.  No shit.  That's a tough sleep.  So why did he say no rematch at first and then like a week later or whatever he signs on?  You know, I've dealt with this a lot with guys, especially, you know, Anderson Silva forgot what it's like to lose.  So right when it's over, you're like, yeah, whatever. 
[00:46:00]  And then, you know, it sinks in and reality sets in over the next few days.  And I met with him.  He fought Saturday.  I met with him again on Thursday and he was very ready to fight again.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to go out that way.  No way.  No way.  You got to go.  They give him another shot.  I was asking Dana off air about A-Rod and he started telling me a pretty great story.  And I said, stop.  I want to hear the rest of it on air.  I just asked you about A-Rod and, you know, what's going on with him.  And then you said that he's like, I didn't want to put words in your mouth. 
[00:46:30]  I said, A-Rod's my man.  He always wrote me, man.  And I'm a Red Sox fan.  It's not a Yankees thing.  But, you know, I was diagnosed with Meniere's disease, which is basically nerve damage to  your inner ear.  How did you get that?  Did you just born with it?  No, you get it from being punched.  You get it from being punched.  You get it from a lot of cops and military guys get it from shooting and the loud noise  from shooting.  A lot of rock stars get it and guys that are in bands get it. 
[00:47:00]  You know, it's basically you do damage to that nerve.  And what it does is the nerve starts telling the brain that you're moving when you're  not.  And when you get these attacks, you literally, I'm telling you, you go down like you got  shot by a fucking sniper, man.  It's crazy.  You go down.  Do you feel nauseous?  Oh, you puke.  If you don't close your eyes and get in a dark room, you will puke your brains out.  Is it like being like a dizzy feeling?  No, it's vertical.  You start spinning.  The room starts spinning.  Oh, my God.  Radio guys.  Like your worst.  I'm turning down my headphones. 
[00:47:30]  The worst.  It's the worst thing you could ever imagine.  A lot of people can get suicide and get it.  Jesus.  Yeah.  It's real bad.  So there's no cure for it.  There's no cure.  They try to do things, you know, there's a surgery where they can put a stint in there.  And I did that surgery.  We saw the video.  Yeah.  That video was horrific.  There's a surgery where they go.  It's basically brain surgery is what it is.  They drill through your skull, get inside there, and they insert this tube. 
[00:48:00]  And there's another one where they go even deeper, and they cut the nerve itself.  And you have to learn how to walk again after they cut that nerve.  Oh, my God.  Now, they didn't cut the nerve.  No, I didn't cut the nerve.  I went for the stint.  And it actually made me worse.  I went from having attacks every once in a while to having attacks every day.  And then it also gave me tinnitus.  And tinnitus is the constant loud ringing of the ear.  Your ear just rings really loud all the time.  I had that.  That's terrible. 
[00:48:30]  I've gotten the woozy thing, too.  Really?  I've definitely gotten that.  I'm sober?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, no.  See, no.  It was from constantly drinking.  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  No, I've gotten that before where I'll be working on something, working on some equipment  downstairs, and I'll have to go like this, maybe turn sideways, and totally disoriented  where you're completely spun around.  You've got to, yeah, shut your eyes, go look up, straighten your head out, and then it's 
[00:49:00]  like, gone.  But not totally gone, just a little, still a little woozy.  That could be, you know, symptoms of it coming out.  How long ago, when was the last time you had, listen to me talking to him like I'm a doctor.  So when was the last time you had these things?  This happened fucking for years and years and years on and off.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Terrible.  It could be, but when you get this, you're down for hours.  Some people are down for days sometimes.  Whoa, okay.  Yeah, when I would get an attack, I'd be down for nine, ten hours. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  At what point after surgery did you realize, oh my God, it didn't work?  Like, how long did it take you to realize, like, fuck it, made it worse?  A couple months.  Oh, a while later, okay.  Yeah, well, no, I knew I was, because after that surgery, you know, recovering from that  is brutal.  I was still, I literally did that surgery, flew home the next morning, and then flew to Chicago  for the UFC on Fox Chicago fight.  So I kept right on going.  Well, you hit it pretty well, because your work ethic, everyone knows about. 
[00:50:00]  So I can't imagine you being, you know, down and out for nine hours.  Yeah, I was tough and through it, you know.  But my life, my life the year after that happened to me, my life was so different.  I literally couldn't do anything, man.  I was just down and out.  I didn't work out for over a year.  Damn, wow.  Yeah, it was driving me crazy.  So I was literally at the point where I'd just given up, and I said, this is going to  be the rest of my life.  This is my life now.  You know, my quality of life is over.  It's just not ever going to be what it was before. 
[00:50:30]  So I get a call from A-Rod, and Kobe Bryant had sent him out to Dusseldorf, Germany, his knee  and back.  They do this stuff out there where they take your blood, and they do what's called  spinning.  And I'm no doctor, so I can't really explain exactly what they do.  But they take your blood, they incubate it, they spin it, and then they give you, they  inject it back into you 10 hours later.  And I got the injection on Sunday. 
[00:51:00]  I flew back to Vegas from Germany, and that was Sunday.  I landed.  I went to bed, got up.  I had to fly to Stanford.  I spoke at their business school on Monday, you know, and I didn't really feel any different.  And flew back home, worked a little, went to bed, woke up Tuesday morning, and felt  like fucking Superman.  I'm not kidding you, man.  I felt like, I felt like I could fly to work.  I could have flew to work that Tuesday.  And from that day on to right now, my life has been exactly the same as it was before 
[00:51:30]  I had the surgery.  How long ago is this that you got the final?  I've had, so what happens is when you fly out there, they take so much blood.  It's funny because they're sitting there and they're like, do you have a problem giving  blood or whatever?  I said, no, it doesn't bother me at all.  So I'm sitting there, the girl sticks the needle in me.  I'm like, God damn, that hurt.  This chick doesn't know what she's doing.  And I look down, they got a Slurpee straw in my frigging arm.  The needle is so big and the blood just flies out of your arm. 
[00:52:00]  And they literally fill up three Fiji bottles, you know, that size, you know, full of blood.  And it literally takes, you know, 30 seconds to fill this whole thing up.  They bandage your arm up.  I had a huge bruise.  This whole inside of my arm became, you know, yellow, black and blue and purple, you know.  So, and, you know, then you go hang out in your hotel, kick around Düsseldorf, Germany  for 10 hours and you go back and they give you the shot. 
[00:52:30]  Wait, now they incubate some of your blood, obviously, not all of them, but they just take  that much of your blood and they incubate it and they do something to it.  All of it.  Because they end up making, with the blood they take, they end up making two shots.  It concentrates down to a certain amount.  Yeah.  To two little shots.  To two shots.  Super shots.  Yeah.  And what's in those shots?  It's just your blood and, I can't remember what it's called.  I'll get you the book.  Yeah.  I'll get you the book so you can check it out.  Because now Jimmy wants his dog.  Well, here's the thing.  The thing is, here's their philosophy out there, is that as we get older, everything 
[00:53:00]  that we have, including some of these diseases that are out there, like Parkinson's and other  things, are due to inflammation.  Inflammation is what starts to break us down from arthritis to joint pain to even, they  said, what was giving me the attacks with the nerve was inflammation.  Inflammation starts to get the nerve irritated, and it's just, I'm telling you guys, it's  amazing.  So, the crazy part about this is you have to be referred to these guys.  You can't just go out there.  You have to be referred.  So, A-Rod refers me. 
[00:53:30]  I fly out there, and my life's been different ever since.  It's unbelievable, right?  So, you didn't have to go back, right?  Was that one?  I flew back.  I went back twice.  I flew back three months later and got the second shot.  So, I did two shots.  I did the first one, flew back three months later, and got the second one.  Oh, when they incubate it down, they incubate it down to two shots, and they hold one for  three months?  Exactly.  Oh, they don't give you both.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the blood that they do is good for six months.  So, you got six months to get back there to get the second shot.  I felt so good, I said, fuck it, I'm going out there.  I was going to fly back the next week and do it. 
[00:54:00]  So, I went out there and got it done.  And the funny part of the story is, you know, when you look at who they've helped, you know,  George Clooney apparently couldn't lift his shoulders up over his head.  Clooney's been out there.  Pope John Paul couldn't kneel anymore.  So, Pope John Paul did it, and it started to, you know, he had Parkinson's disease, and  I guess they get tremors or whatever their attacks are.  He was having no attacks before he passed away, eventually.  And then, you know, golfers, Kevin Durant from OKC, every soccer player out in Europe, 
[00:54:30]  and the list goes on of all these people that they do.  They all believe, wow.  So, you think about health care here in the United States, right?  And, you know, all they want to do here is cut you and put you on pills.  They don't really fix anything.  They just sort of mask all the problems.  These guys are out there actually curing people in Germany.  It's the level of medicine there and the level of medicine here is night and day.  Why don't they bring it to the States? 
[00:55:00]  It's illegal here.  I have no idea.  I know.  Why?  If it's working for people.  Here's the craziest part.  Let me get to this part, right?  So, Clooney, all these actors and actresses and athletes and all these people, the one  thing I never asked is, how much does this cost?  Right?  Sure.  I didn't give a shit.  I just wanted to get out there and if this thing was going to work for me, I'm in, right?  So, I get out there and the other thing, the attention, you get there, the first day you  get there, they do this full MRI of your body, your brain, your spine, everything. 
[00:55:30]  And the doctor literally sits with you and goes organ by organ and tells you, you know,  what's going on with you and looks at all your stuff.  And then I went in and saw an ear, nose and throat specialist.  Then I saw the doctor who does the actual blood work and, I mean, I must have saw four  doctors and they spent hours with me over a two-day period.  Oh, man.  Right?  Yeah.  So, you're thinking, you know, holy shit.  So, finally he goes through the whole last thing and they're about to take my blood and  he says, any other questions? 
[00:56:00]  And I'm like, yeah.  How much does this cost?  What's this going to cost?  And he goes, eh, we'll take care of that at the end.  I go, eh, I'm kind of curious and would like to know right now.  So, he says, hold on.  He goes in the other room, comes back, 7,500 euros.  That's it?  That's 10 grand.  Yeah.  7,500 euros.  Wow.  That's not for that.  So, this isn't something that, you're right, that it's only for the super wealthy can go  there and get them, anybody could do it. 
[00:56:30]  If you have, especially anybody who has Meniere's disease, only people who have Meniere's disease  know what it's like to go through it.  And anybody would come up with 10 grand.  And if you had to take a loan out to go get your life back, you would do it.  And then, you know, they're helping people with Parkinson's.  The first guy I called when I landed in the States was Freddie Roach.  I told Freddie Roach, Freddie, I'm telling you, go try this thing, man.  I don't know if he's done it, but I set him up to do it.  I don't know if he has.  So, have you had an attack since?  No.  Nothing? 
[00:57:00]  No.  Wow.  That's a miracle.  I am healed, man.  I'm like 100%.  And that whole time that I was going through it, you can't eat salt.  You're not allowed to drink alcohol.  There's a lot of things that will aggravate it.  I've been eating salt and drinking plenty of alcohol, and I'm good.  One last question.  Do you have to go back to keep it up, or you're good, good?  Yeah.  Well, what they said is, you know, obviously, ride this thing.  First of all, when I went there, they didn't know if it would help me or not.  It wasn't like, oh, yeah, this is definitely going to help you. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, they didn't know if it would or not, and they said, but I'll tell you what, we'll  give this thing a shot.  We'll see how it goes.  And they said people that they had, you know, done, who had Meniere's disease, had less than  one attack a month after, you know, doing this thing.  So they don't give you any guarantees.  They don't say, oh, this is the magic pill.  Spend your 7,500 euros, and this is going to work.  Good for you, man.  We have no idea.  We'll see.  Good for you.  But after your second treatment, do they say, like you said the first one, they say,  okay, you've got to come back in three months. 
[00:58:00]  But after that second one, is there a time frame where they say, now we see how it goes?  Yeah, now we play it by ear.  Just ride it out.  If anything starts to happen to you again, call us.  We'll get you back in, and we'll do it again.  And how much time since your second one?  It's been a while now.  I don't know how long.  Oh, no, no.  It's been seven or eight months.  So if worst case scenario, if you've got to go once or twice a year, you've gotten your  life for once or twice a year, which is pretty fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  And it's annoying that they won't do it here.  There's probably some garbage FDA excuse because, like you said, they want to keep you on pills. 
[00:58:30]  And this is wiping stuff out.  Not only that, and you can blame the FDA, but you also got to blame all the fucking litigious  United States that we have.  So the FDA passes this through, it goes through, somebody sues, and now, you know, it's all  about that.  So they need every little stamp of approval from the FDA so they don't...  So go to Germany.  Enjoy yourself.  Exactly.  Yeah, seriously.  It's true.  It's true, man.  You know, this place is open seven days a week.  They said weekends.  It's just packed with Americans.  Really?  Well, everyone is calling. 
[00:59:00]  They're like, give us the website, the place.  That's amazing.  Everyone wants to book a trip.  Well, you've got to be referred for this one.  Yeah, you have to be referred to them.  Yeah.  And that's the only place in the world they do it?  That's the only place I know of.  And that's where everybody's going.  You know, and there's places here in the United States because people have said, oh,  they do the same thing in the United States.  No, they don't.  Trust me.  It's not the same.  You think, you know, all these actors and athletes are flying to Dusseldorf, Germany,  because they're doing the same thing here in the United States?  Go to Beverly Hills somewhere.  Yeah.  But that's what they're doing. 
[00:59:30]  So what's happening now is this place in Germany is opening all these places.  They have a place in Beverly Hills.  So you go to the place in Beverly Hills.  They do all the testing there.  They test you.  They do all the MRIs.  And then they fly you to Dusseldorf to do the shots.  So you don't have to do all that stuff there.  Did Kobe and A-Rod get this done for their injuries?  Yeah.  Tons of guys have.  And did it make A-Rod hit the ball better?  Well, no.  It's not about hitting the ball better.  It's about his knee and his back were messed up.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  And that's what these guys specialize in.  That's what they really do.  Their joint and bones and things like that is what they do.  Inflammation in general.  Yeah.  But as they continue to do more studies, they're finding out that inflammation is the cause to  a lot of our problems as we get older.  So how do we knock down our inflammation?  You fly to Dusseldorf.  But there's nothing else we could do with supplements or anything else we could do now?  I don't think so.  It's part of, you know, the human structure as we start to get older. 
[01:00:30]  That's what happens to us.  We start to...  Wow.  I'm emotionally inflamed.  Yeah.  Rogan's going.  Rogan's got back problems and Rogan's going out there.  I got him set up.  It works on apes.  He's trying to have the fucking hair on.  He wants to have his arms raised.  It's a human life.  You're fucking savage.  I watch him walk around with his chain wallet and I'm like, am I competing?  You're going to get it.  This guy?  I know.  Horrifying.  Fucking Joe is the best, man.  More of the O.D.

It's bad news when the Opie and Anthony show starts getting cute girl interns.  That couldn't be more of a distraction.  No work was getting done, and all they were doing was getting rewarded.  Well, little Sydney from Florida said goodbye to the Opie and Anthony show this week.  She had a very fruitful internship.  Not exactly sure what she did, but O&A sure liked her a lot more than they liked me when I was an intern. 
[01:06:00]  We say goodbye to intern Sydney in style here on The Countdown.  We're losing Sydney today.  Yeah, where is Sydney's last day?  You guys never go late.  The beautiful Sydney.  No, we go late a lot.  Yeah.  You wouldn't stay for Ricky Gervais.  Well, yeah, that's Ricky.  What?  Seriously.  Ricky Gervais.  Ricky Gervais.  This is Sydney.  No, we stay late for the interns.  What?  Every single time. 
[01:06:30]  You're simply the best.  That's right.  Wow.  There she is.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Simply the best.  Absolutely.  Of course, the song we play for all the interns is to send them off.  Yes, to send them off.  It's been a staple for everybody.  We always have been getting shadowed upon for eight years.  Eight years.  My entire adult life.  I don't know.  Must be nice, Sydney.  Sydney.  She's done an amazing job as an intern for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:07:00]  What's your favorite thing that she's done?  Look, like I said before, when there's a well-oiled machine because everybody knows what  they're doing, you don't notice.  You just know it works.  It's not about specifics.  So when I would look around and go, oh, my God, I don't even have to notice that this  isn't happening or that isn't happening.  Right.  That's how you know that it's working.  And it wouldn't be fair to the staff if we point out how amazing she's been.  Right.  It's what you do, though.  What?  On a regular basis.  Everyone just knows she was amazing. 
[01:07:30]  They don't want to make you feel bad, Sam.  That's what they're saying.  How come, no matter what the old interns used to do, I'd be angry?  And now I'm not.  I have one guess.  Yes.  With Sydney and Jackie.  Like, you know, because they're doing a good job.  That's why.  That's right.  Yeah.  This is Sydney's last day.  She's going back to Florida to do radio.  Yeah.  I got a job.  You got a job.  She's the first one actually doing radio after her internship. 
[01:08:00]  That is pretty cool.  Thank you.  The first one.  What are you going to be doing?  I'm going to be doing mostly, like, board hopping and production stuff.  Oh, that's a foot in the door right there.  And then on either Saturdays or Sundays.  A cute, adorable foot right in that door.  Teeny, teeny, weeny.  A tiny, little, cute, kissable foot right in the door.  We were there for a second.  What?  Just because it's her last day doesn't mean you can start getting creepy.  We're not being creepy.  We're not being creepy.  We were talking about foot in the door.  Right.  Just like anybody. 
[01:08:30]  That's right.  So what's going on on the weekends?  On the weekends, I get a four-hour show.  Whoa.  You get your own show?  Yeah.  That's pretty incredible.  I'm pretty excited.  Like Sam Roberts.  Yeah, but she's going to have a better career than me by the time.  Of course she is.  Six months, of course.  Should we have Denny come in here to give her some quick pointers?  She's going to have a better career than Denny instead.  Yeah.  Well, she already does.  What kind of show are you going to do?  Like a music show?  Yeah.  It's called the Modern Music Channel, which I don't know what that is.  Modern music.  Like Flo Rida.  Don't say that in front of Denny. 
[01:09:00]  He'll tell you exactly what that means.  Well, modern music is...  And then I'll blather on.  Right.  What is Sal hanging out there all creepily?  Because Sal doesn't understand how things work.  Yeah.  Well, so your internship here at the Opie and Anthony program, a plus in your life or  a minus?  A definite plus.  Yeah.  A solid plus.  A solid plus.  Did you enjoy yourself?  I did.  How are your superiors?  How did they treat you?  With respect?  Very respectful. 
[01:09:30]  Very good.  And your boss was Iraq?  Yes.  Was he a good boss?  I would say so.  Wow.  He was a lot of fun.  Can I ask a question?  What?  Iraq fun?  Can I ask a question?  Certainly.  Did you ever have to put shit on your head?  That's a negative.  I did not.  Did you ever have to grab into a toilet?  I did not.  And squish up duty?  I hope none of this changes today.  Should I grab the shaving cream and the razors?  You like your eyebrows?  Oh.  I don't even know what you're talking about, Sal.  You never had to have your eyebrows shaved? 
[01:10:00]  No.  No.  Nothing like that?  We thought that kid was Hispanic.  We were just doing him a favor.  Shaving the eyebrows before they tattoo him back on.  Well.  Might know something about that.  This is a...  Mars does, certainly.  This is so sad.  Do you know about the tattooing of...  Sad day.  Oh, look.  Oh, wow.  Here it is.  Balloons, of course.  Sydney, look.  We got you.  Red, white, and blue balloons.  Balloons.  Jackie, this is exactly what's going to happen to you when you leave us.  Yes.  It's so sad. 
[01:10:30]  You, not so much.  Whoever you are, what challenge does that kid work for?  The boy intern just brought in the cake.  He has to bring in the cake.  And the balloons.  And the balloons.  And then Jackie walked in behind him holding nothing.  And just sat down.  She's already worked hard today.  Exactly.  She's insane.  Yes.  I'll help you.  Aw.  They're opening up the box.  What does that say?  Good luck, Sydney.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  This is how you do things, Sam.  Since when?  It's been a while.  Since the beginning. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  We're finally seeing some results here.  You know what happened when I was an intern?  I didn't get a goodbye.  And then I went back to Syracuse.  And I called the show one time.  Scorch.  And you guys didn't take my phone call.  Oh.  You remember that, don't you?  I felt like, who is that guy?  What was his name?  And I just sat on hold.  Like, we'll have to intern Sam.  I'm back on the phone.  They were like, yeah, we're not taking that call.  45 minutes.  Just pacing in my dorm room.  Sam, it's not about you.  Did you ever wear an adorable little summer dress like that?  No.  I could have fit in it, but I did not ever. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, you could have back in the day.  Yeah.  What kind of cake did we get?  I know, but why don't you tell the people, Sydney?  Oh, what kind is it?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you cut into it and see, right?  She's got a hand.  Why should I spoil the surprise?  I know exactly what kind of cake it is.  I could use a little piece of cake.  But I'd rather you be surprised by what we got.  She's got a handful of red, white, and blue balloons.  Oh, now they're on the mic.  Let me...  Oh.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Yes, it is.  I'm going to have to take a picture. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, hold on.  Let's, um...  Who's that?  Get him out of there.  Who's cutting the cake?  Oh.  That's the boy intern who's cutting the cake with his shaky hands.  Oh, God.  Don't touch it.  You're doing great.  Now, and Sidney's just condescendingly telling him he's doing a great job.  I'm really excited about this cake.  I just want it.  Sidney, some thoughts on your internship.  Some thoughts.  Oh, I know.  Maybe some highlights.  Highlights?  Or any kind of thoughts in general.  The fact that there even were highlights to her internship shows you how unfair this 
[01:12:30]  whole thing is.  Don't touch it!  Who is this kid?  Let Sidney do it.  If someone's got to touch the cake, I don't mind eating a cake that Sidney's touched.  You take a hike.  This is intern douchebag.  You take a hike, it's for the show only.  Wait, he's going to be intern next semester?  I think I got a great picture right there.  Yeah, you just literally shoot intern douchebag out of the studio.  Wait, are you guys sad that you guys are separating?  Sidney and Jackie, are you sad?  What a team you've made.  You guys became friends, right?  I'm coming to Florida soon. 
[01:13:00]  I'm going to drive to Florida, so I'll go there.  You guys are now friends, right?  The people that work here don't even like each other.  How can these two like each other?  Because we're awesome.  Because we have a very good work environment.  Yes, yes.  It's very obvious.  It has been very nice.  Can I touch it?  You can touch it.  You can touch it.  You can touch it.  I don't care.  Smear it all over yourself.  Doesn't it?  Smear it all over yourself.  I'm sure you've got a change of clothes.  There's something different about a cute girl touching the cake that you've got to eat,  or some greasy fucking dude. 
[01:13:30]  Jackie, well, we're made by with you.  Me and Anthony talk about this almost every morning.  What?  We've never seen a duplicate outfit.  Thank you, because I have actually tried very hard to do that this summer,  and I have never worn the same shirt tights.  It's been a fashion show.  I feel honored.  It's been a fashion show every morning.  I feel honored that you actually noticed.  Of course we noticed.  Yes, we noticed.  When someone makes the effort like that, we notice.  I made a very hard effort.  I make the effort, though, to try not to repeat it. 
[01:14:00]  I dress great.  I try to dress nice and nice.  Sam, a different outfit every day for her.  Every day.  And the last week will be exactly the same.  She'll touch it off with, like, a little skirt or put the little hat on or something.  Of course.  It's just amazing.  We've noticed.  You've never, ever appreciated my dress.  What kind of U-Haul do you need to get back to Rochester with all the clothes you brought  down here?  Yeah, me and my mom are going to have a difficult time moving me out.  I had at least three suitcases of just clothes and shoes.  And you're not even playing the I Don't Care song. 
[01:14:30]  What?  What are you talking about?  She's just telling this story, and it's like, it's interesting and compelling.  It couldn't be less interesting.  This is what radio is made for.  This is terrific.  It's exactly what we were talking about.  This is compelling.  Exactly.  You didn't got this.  You're always looking for compelling content.  Not only were you not playing the I Don't Care song, your arms were actually folded.  There wasn't even a thought to play a button.  Look at the haters.  Jackie equals worst voice ever.  That's why I'm on air and you're not.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something right now. 
[01:15:00]  It's a bit nasally, but who cares?  Jackie.  Right.  Yes.  Bounce.  He's out of the room.  Thank you.  Out of the fucking room.  But he's right.  You don't say that shit.  I got an awful accent.  It's all right.  Everyone's already told me I need speech classes before anything.  I think it's in there.  We live in Rochester.  That's how they speak.  Why are we making fun of our voice?  They all speak out of their noses up there.  I lived up there.  I think it's very undaring.  Just go like this and it could sound like you're from Rochester.  Spinach.  Hey, see out.  Does anybody want a piece of cake? 
[01:15:30]  It's all like Minnesota.  It's the best when Roland makes fun of me, though, because Roland only has one accent for  every place in the world, so he always has a heck accent.  Oh, it goes to me.  So I'm from like Alabama every time he makes fun of me.  Alabama.  Alabama.  Alabama.  Very nasally up there.  Isn't that where they grow spinach?  Spinach.  I like that.  I brought you some Alabama spinach.  Thank you.  We'll let everybody else know.  You know what?  Insanity.  The sweetness of the cake represents Sydney's tenure here at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:16:00]  Awesome.  But it's covering up the bitter part of you having to leave us.  Very sad.  Very sad.  Very bitter.  Sweet moment.  You're right.  It's very sweet.  It's a sweet moment.  She's supposed to leave.  None of you guys notice her today and then forget she ever existed by Monday.  That's how this works.  Why don't you join the haters on Twitter?  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Why don't you go fucking join those people? 
[01:16:30]  Can we bounce you?  Right.  No.  No.  Fucking blocking you on Twitter today.  How dare you?  You really are.  You're a fucking hater.  Negative Nelly.  That hater hate.  He rocked.  Get that shit out of you.  She also wants to know that when you're done, if you could take a moment to take a photo  with her before you leave.  Of course.  I'm surprised they didn't ask her to take a photo.  I'm camera.  I want a summer camp photo.  I do want that.  You do?  I made sure I was camera.  Yeah, we should.  We do need one.  Their office was summer camp and you guys just let it be summer camp.  Why?  I made sure I was camera ready today.  You did? 
[01:17:00]  I didn't take a picture with Kennedy.  I didn't take a picture with any of the Breaking Bad guys.  No.  I haven't taken a picture in a week or so because I didn't feel like I was camera ready.  But for you, I'm camera ready.  Thank you.  Which means that you knew yesterday or this morning.  I actually got the haircut knowing this day was coming.  Oh, wow.  Why would you know when her last day was?  That's so cute.  That's so cute.  Because I checked the calendar around here, Sam.  It's been circled for months since her last day was.  She didn't even know when her last day was. 
[01:17:30]  No, no, me and Anthony did.  We knew the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  We just knew in our hearts.  Yes.  In our hearts.  We felt the longing knowing it was coming.  We knew.  Oh, Sydney, I only wish the best for you.  I hope this is a good one.  Do you have a budget to bring cakes for the interns?  What?  Of course it does.  It's time we step up.  We step up and let the interns know, job well done.  That's what I say.  The cake is delicious.  The cake is freaking delicious.  It is unbelievably good cake. 
[01:18:00]  It's wonderful.  You're welcome.  You can't stop eating it.  It's so wonderful.  I mean, this whole display has been appalling.  What?  As you eat her cake.  It's good cake.  As you eat her cake.  Hey, jealous.  You can't be upset with a cake in your belly.  Aw.  That's how it works.  Words of wisdom.  And you get to do it next Friday, too.  Aw.  She's just too adorable to be there.  I know.  You can't possibly be mad at him.  Wait, why are you done next Friday?  Summer's not over next Friday.  Well, where are you going? 
[01:18:30]  No, but you guys decided to take that week off.  That was supposed to be my last week.  Oh, no.  No vacation, then.  That's it.  All right.  Let's move around our vacation.  Let's move around.  It's not too late.  It's not too late.  Let's move our vacation.  We're going to move our vacation around.  No, we can't.  It's too late.  No, no.  We've got to move it around.  Jesus.  Aw, that's not very nice.  It's too late.  Sydney, final thoughts?  Final thoughts?  Yeah.  That it was a very good way to spend the summer.  Aw.  Not bad.  And I'm glad everything worked out the way it did. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  So are we.  And that it was very fun interning with you guys.  Aw.  It was a lot of fun.  We're a delight.  You know what?  You are.  This is so telling.  It's been known for a long time that we're just a delight.  She looked at Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And she said, it's been very nice interning with you guys.  Yeah.  Of course.  Not fun.  Every other intern.  What?  Would shake and say for you guys.  Uh-huh.  Because they've been conditioned that you can't even make eye contact with the talent. 
[01:19:30]  No.  But we never said that.  She's over there going with my peers, Opie and Anthony.  Well, sure.  Do you know what it's like to walk through that door every morning, walk past the campgrounds,  and just look in and say, good morning, and get a little good morning, hi, hello.  It sets the tone for my entire day.  I have a really big accomplishment.  You don't even say good morning to us.  What?  You know what happened when you walked by my office this morning? 
[01:20:00]  What?  You did this.  Uh.  I didn't do that.  I got a nice smile and wave.  Oh, yeah.  Good morning.  Maybe Ann had a burp.  He was just getting rid of a burp.  I get good mornings from Kenny.  You do?  Aw.  And thank yous.  Of course.  And you should.  And you should.  Yeah.  I think you had something else you were going to say?  That I...  Because he doesn't even talk to Tyler.  He doesn't acknowledge Tyler.  Who's that?  I don't know who this Tyler guy is.  But I get good mornings and thank yous, and I love it.  Aw.  You mean intern douchebag?  No, I mean Tyler.  Denny, grab a mic. 
[01:20:30]  Denny's here.  Don't grab one of the girls' mics.  No, no.  Grab Sam's.  That's just fine.  No one's going to complain.  Whatever you learn here, forget.  Oh, wow.  Denny.  No, these guys are the best.  Aw.  Of course.  Denny, she's going in the radio for real.  That's great.  She's got her own show.  Not technically.  She's got her own show.  That's how it begins.  We have a part-time position.  I heard.  We lose interns every semester.  What?  This is not an event.  It's time, though. 
[01:21:00]  It's long overdue.  Yeah, I sure will have time.  Aw.  It's long overdue that we should have acknowledged  the interns earlier.  Right.  And now we're just starting a trend here.  That's right.  Is it going to happen from now on?  Yes.  It might.  Denny?  You shouldn't talk with cake in your mouth  and your microphone, Sam.  You're right, Denny.  Just make sure you, you know,  give it your all.  Give 110% every day.  I usually give about 50.  No.  That's good enough.  There's two of you.  It's 50, 50.  That's 100%.  Generally what I'm talking about. 
[01:21:30]  Give 110% unless you're wearing a sundress  and then 30 is fine.  30 is a good day's work.  Yeah, that's the new math.  You know that, right?  Yeah, that's the new math.  Denny, give her advice.  She's working for a modern music station.  That's very good.  Playing contemporary hit music, I guess, right?  Can CHR.  CHR.  Is it CHR?  It's modern music.  Do you know what CHR means?  Contemporary hit music.  Contemporary hit music.  Did you know that before he said that?  No.  That's okay.  You'll learn on the job.  Do you learn?  She just said...  Those are those things they teach you at radio school 
[01:22:00]  that don't even matter.  Right.  CHR.  Yeah, it's not.  Contemporary hit music.  I thought you said CHR.  And everybody goes,  yep, you're right.  I didn't even notice.  I didn't either.  I was like, that's adorable.  Before she even said anything,  it was correct.  Correctamundo.  What's the slug line for the station?  It's like brand new.  Yeah, it's fine.  It used to be... 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, you'll learn that the first day.  It used to be the rock station I worked at  because I had the same thing before I left.  Oh, it'll be written down somewhere for you.  It's fine.  Yeah, you keep it on a 3x5 index card in front of you.  Make sure you open and close the microphone  with the call letters,  the positioning statement,  and just always move forward.  Right.  Move forward.  And stay abreast of everything going on in pop culture.  Like Sam does.  I mean, this guy,  he just knows everything about pop culture.  What a good stummie, too.  Too bad he's such an asshole. 
[01:23:00]  Too bad his voice is fucking horrid.  Right.  Sam, you know what you need?  A suit.  Tell me.  A suit.  And processing.  Right, Denny?  A little inside lingo right there.  A little reverb.  Make believe you're in a gym or something.  Makes care of a world of hurt.  A little optimod.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sydney.  Yes.  Any chance in the future that you might come back and visit?  If I'm invited, of course.  You're invited.  Let me tell you.  Right now, open invite.  Open invite. 
[01:23:30]  Anytime you're in town for anything,  what do you think?  Come by.  What do you think?  The intern last semester,  you shaved his eyebrows,  and today you didn't remember his name.  Did we literally kick him out the door?  Yes.  At that point?  With no eyebrows.  What are you going to do?  That's okay.  Do we have music for Sydney or anything?  Do we have...  What do we got?  Any music?  Yes, of course.  Oh.  Of course.  Oh, this is kind of sad.  This is like touching.  She's a rainbow, though.  We all know that. 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  She brought sunshine into the studio every day.  Smiles.  Good luck to you, Sydney.  You know how important morale is to anything?  Let's hit the post here.  Yeah, it's what's held this show back for years.  Shut up.  Here's the post.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She combed the hair.  She's like a rainbow.  The worst is yet to come.

[01:29:00]  Highlighting all the great moments that happened on O&A this week.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You can hear me on the Opie and Anthony Show and after Opie and Anthony Live.  In the meantime, Skylar, who plays Walter White's wife.  Her name's Anna Gunn in real life.  From Breaking Bad.  She was on the show this week.  We'll hear from her in a second, as well as the first ever appearance of the Insane Clown  Posse in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Before that, Dean Norris, E-Rock has it spelled Betsy Brandy.  He prints these things out for me. 
[01:29:30]  I think her name's, like, Betsy Brandt.  I should have looked that up on IMDb.  E-Rock says it's Betsy Brandy on this page.  So, maybe I'm wrong.  Probably not.  I'm usually not.  But, who knows.  They play a married couple on Breaking Bad.  As it turns out, they're not married in real life.  However, they were still in studio together.  What an amazing thing.  From Breaking Bad on the worst of the weekend.  Number three.  Hey! 
[01:30:00]  Oh, look what we got here.  Dean.  Oh, my God.  They know each other.  Dean Norris.  It's so weird.  Where does he go?  Where does he go?  Come here.  Dean, take a seat right there.  That's, oh, look.  Oh, the happy couple.  Oh, my bubbles.  The happy couple.  Look at that.  Now the bubbles are popping.  Oh, they are popping.  Dean Norris is in studio.  He's sitting on Betsy's lap.  You look so handsome.  Look at him.  Don't they look great?  Yeah.  You look so handsome here.  Yeah, sitting on Betsy's lap.  Oh, yeah.  Is the party over already? 
[01:30:30]  Is it over?  Is the party over?  No.  No party.  No party's going.  You just got here, honey.  Party.  Now it can begin.  It's so odd to see, like, you guys are going to be a TV show couple.  And there you are.  Yes.  It's like watching Lucy and Ricky.  It's amazing.  He never stops working.  Look at him.  He's never stopped working.  He's landing the space shuttle right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course, Hank.  Yes, sir.  From Breaking Bad. 
[01:31:00]  But I was just saying, I saw the advanced copy.  I've been fully involved in the show over the entire course of it.  And then I finally saw the first episode of the new season without any spoilers or anything.  I've got to tell you, wow.  Wow.  I was sitting there just not wanting that screen to go dark and have the credits come up.  Oh.  Because now I've got to wait.  And the closing scene of that is just, it's brutal.  It's subtle brutality. 
[01:31:30]  Because, I mean, Walter gives that a threat.  It's a threat.  Yeah.  I'll say that much.  But it's done in that inimitable, quiet style.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And as Hank's wife, what role are you going to play in this?  I mean, things are going down.  We know from last season, of course, Hank took that dump and picked up that book.  That pretty much revealed what was going on. 
[01:32:00]  And now, how...  What do you mean, what role am I going to...  You talk about his dump and then you ask me what role I'm going to play.  Well...  I mean, she changed my bedpan in season four, but...  He comes out of the bathroom and then Marie comes out.  She's washing her hands.  You go through this series with...  You're very naive.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  But you're not really willing to accept that something bad's going on.  Oh, well, is it that she's naive?  You just popped my bubble.  That's what I meant. 
[01:32:30]  You just popped my bubble.  I've been popping your bubble for six years.  I know.  It's working.  And it's working.  It's not that she's naive.  She just doesn't know.  Yeah, but like...  Because who...  Look at Walt.  Yeah.  Wait, what sister-in-law would be like, you know what I think?  I think Walt's a drug kingpin.  Look at him in his ugly ass shoes and that sick green car.  He's clearly...  Okay.  Good point.  But you'd think being married to...  Then I'd be a paranoid person. 
[01:33:00]  ...a DEA guy, maybe something would rub off or you'd get a little info or...  You'd stay out of his work.  Except when you were getting his rocks.  I don't think Marie stays out of anything.  Getting my rocks?  What?  Rocks off?  Getting his rocks off.  He's such my rocks.  Minerals, motherfucker.  No, you can say that.  Can you say motherfucker?  Motherfucker.  Fuck you.  It's fucking rocks.  Fucking minerals.  They were minerals, right.  Your rocks are here.  They're fucking minerals.  God damn.  It's so good to not be on TV and you can say fuck. 
[01:33:30]  I know.  I know.  All I do for the last two weeks is not say fuck and not say the ending of Breaking Bad.  Right, right.  Those are the two things you're not allowed to do.  Are we not supposed to say the ending?  Oh, man.  Oh, you can't.  You're cool.  I know your wife.  You can say whatever the fuck you want to say at the end of the day.  I want to know it, but then don't want to know it.  I want to see it.  I know.  I want to see it happen.  You don't want to know it.  No.  Do you know it?  No.  Sometimes you guys don't know it.  Oh, yeah.  We know it.  Oh, yeah.  No, we know it.  All right.  Sometimes you guys come in here from a series and you don't know for sure. 
[01:34:00]  What are they on?  What are they on?  Meth?  No.  They know.  It's, yeah.  This is it.  This is the end.  And it has to be a little emotional, right?  Oh, man.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Especially this week.  Sorry.  Could you get me a coffee, Dean?  Could you order me a coffee?  You got one.  Straight up.  Go pass these some coffee.  Straight up.  That's how I do my liquor, baby.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good. 
[01:34:30]  You sure you're good?  Yeah.  I had a cup of coffee this morning.  I had some chocolate with my real husband.  Oh, damn.  I didn't say that to be mean, but it sounded mean, and I didn't mean it.  You know I'm married in real life.  Oh, man.  Off the show.  You know that, right?  Fuck.  This is ruining everything.  This is ruining everything.  I feel like I need to tell you.  I'm so sorry.  It's a little late, isn't it?  Hey, but I'm always thinking about you, baby.  You're who I really love.  When you play a couple, is there any real attraction there? 
[01:35:00]  It's got to be difficult to not feel something if you're playing a married couple.  I feel absolutely nothing.  Not me.  I feel it all.  It's a job.  They go, cut, I run.  I feel it all.  No, I miss you so much.  In all seriousness, in all seriousness, it was such an amazing thing.  It was an amazing thing to have Betsy Brandt play my wife.  More than I can tell you.  She just added so much.  Her inner humanity comes out in the role, and it's such a great thing. 
[01:35:30]  Because I think it was such a big part of Hank's own morality.  It stemmed, if he wasn't married, he would have broke bad a long time ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That feel.  And I feel like having Betsy play Marie, it will always be just an amazing part of, for me, a memory of the show.  Because she brought all that to it, and it was like, oh, man.  It's just awesome.  You're making me cry, man.  Oh, shush.  Really, you are. 
[01:36:00]  You're making me cry.  It does seem like the only real, real true loyalty you have is to the family, to your family.  And that pretty much holds you from probably, yeah, going the way of Walter.  Going really bad, and he kind of would just think back.  At least I did as a character, would always, in the kind of crucial moments, and there are some more crucial moments coming up.  Oh, damn it.  And would always just think back to my wife, you know, and go, all right, that's why I've got to be strong, and that's why I've got to be the good guy, and go from there.  I love this, too. 
[01:36:30]  I love being a part of this couple.  Yeah.  And to do that with you.  Yeah.  You know, but even from the beginning, I just, I love that they would do anything for each other.  Yeah.  And in this show where people are just horrible to each other, and they decapitate this guy and stick his head on a turtle, and we have this beautiful relationship.  Yin-yang, I think that's what they're going to do.  Yes.  Yes, yeah, in the middle of all that turmoil.  You know, I always loved that.  And trouble, yeah, trouble, like, I always refer back to a scene where Hank is basically leaving the DEA, and he gets this elevator, and you never see him make a phone call or anything, but somehow his wife just knows that it's a bad day, and she shows up. 
[01:37:00]  When you talk about that, I remember that, like this, like a second, I remember, I said, just don't look at me until we do the take.  And it was the only time I said some crazy, you know, method acting like that.  But I did, because it was such an emotional moment, and I just couldn't, but as soon as I looked at her, it was just, you know, tears, you know, just because, you know, it was like the worst day, and he's like, fuck. 
[01:37:30]  And then the elevator opens, and it's his wife, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wow, that is.  I mean, you know how hard it was for me in that moment not to cry?  And I remember asking Frida, who did our makeup at the time, I said, did we get it?  Did we get it?  Did they tell you we got it?  And he said yes, and then I just sobbed.  Oh, holy shit.  I did a lot on the show, because Marie doesn't let go and cry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And also, I think in that moment, she just wouldn't.  She's like, no, this is all about you, baby. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not about me, you know, it's not about me crying, and it's, you know, it's about me being there for you.  Yeah, awesome.  Wow, that's getting really deep into your character when you're on set like that.  Oh, my God.  It was so fun.  It was fun.  I'm going to miss it.  When did you wrap?  How long ago?  End of March, beginning of April.  Really?  I actually don't even know.  I feel like I'm in this weird time zone that I really don't even know.  But that sounds right.  What he says sounds right.  So you've been doing press and stuff, and then I guess that's kind of, wow, and then you're just done. 
[01:38:30]  It's crazy.  It's kind of hitting me now this week.  Like when we wrapped, I had to go to another job, and so did you.  So it was less, I don't know, just, I mean, you were kind of emotional about it, but it wasn't.  This week, though, it's like this kind of final victory tour, you know, and it's like, wait a minute.  I'm not going to see.  I thought I was doing better with it than I am.  Now, I'm like, wow, last premiere.  Wait, what do you mean last? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  It's not coming back.  Yeah, we can fake it, though.  We can just make a problem.  I asked him.  I asked him.  Let's show it again.  I told AMC last night, I said, if you bankroll it, I'll shoot three more.  We'll show up and do the work.  Just three more.  I'll do it.  I'll do it for free.  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't?  That's what I said.  As long as they bankroll it, and we'll show up.  It's like a kind of a goofy spinoff where you're almost like the new Ropers.  That way.  You go from that.  I get to wear a caftan.  Yes.  I'm in.  I love that.  I love that.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:39:30]  You're already on another sitcom.  My bad.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry.  You're stuck in a bubble.  That's a dumb motherfucker.  That's a dumb motherfucker.  What is that?  How do you do that?  It's a dumb, man.  That's a dumb.  How do you do that?  It's a bad-ass dumb.  You touch it, and it gets all weird.  Steven Spielberg, man.  It messes with you.  Oh, you make fun of Steven Spielberg?  Is that what you're doing?  You want to make fun of Steven Spielberg and his TV show?  Yep.  How about Steven King?  You want to make fun of him, too?  No.  Okay.  No, I'm not making fun of anybody, Dean.  I'm just asking about the special effects.  Under the dome.  I can't watch that show at night. 
[01:40:00]  Really?  Really.  For real, I can't.  I told my husband, I'm like, we cannot watch it before we go to bed.  Too creepy?  I can't.  It just freaks me out.  It freaks me out to be trapped in there.  It's just crazy.  Well, they're all under there, so it's kind of nice.  Oh, I just got a pit feeling in my stomach.  It's like a microcosm of humanity under the dome.  But I'm there.  I'm there.  But you're stuck.  You're all stuck.  What are you going to do with all that fuel?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Stay tuned.  Thank you, Jim.  What are you going to do?  And, Betsy, you're working with Michael J. Fox.  Yes.  That's got to be pretty damn cool. 
[01:40:30]  It's great.  Easy, easy, easy.  Easy.  No Dean Norris.  Okay.  Thank you.  Temper that easy.  But he's pretty great.  Watch it.  Yeah.  I know.  I swear.  Do you just feel compelled?  I'm thinking of you the whole time, baby.  I'm thinking of you the whole time.  Do you feel compelled to just ask Michael J. Fox  Back to the Future questions?  Oh, no.  I would just ask him that all the time.  But how did this?  How many DeLoreans were in that one scene?  If you think about it, you'd just be like, shut up. 
[01:41:00]  No, I don't.  But I do feel compelled to go,  Sha-la-la-la.  All right.  Well, that's from Family Ties.  The theme song, yes.  Sha-la-la-la.  I hope you can get the rights to that.  Because otherwise this whole time...  That is pretty good that you two go from Breaking Bad to, you know, other...  Hit shows.  Very hit shows.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, come on.  Not too shabby.  Yeah.  Not too shabby.  You're going to have to watch your language, though.  I didn't know...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's another thing.  You're good at that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm pretty... 
[01:41:30]  You can't turn to Michael J. Fox and go,  What the fuck are you doing?  You're like, oh, man.  That is usually how I talk to people.  I think you confuse me with my friend Dean Norris.  Are you normally more reserved or a little potty mouth?  Oh, no.  I'm a potty mouth.  Oh, yeah?  I try and keep it in check with my children.  Yeah, huh?  How old are your kids?  Eight and four and a half.  Oh, yeah.  Those are those very formative years where they'll just pick up everything, right? 
[01:42:00]  You know, there's that time where you're like, oh, my little boy, when he was a toddler,  I was like, oh, he's not...  He's not listening.  He's not talking.  And then he spilled his sippy cup and he goes, God damn it!  And I told my husband, I said, it's not like he's trying to say fork and he says fuck,  which we think is hilarious.  You know, instead of sitting, he says shit.  Also really funny.  There's plenty of videos out there, yeah.  I said, this is cursing.  And then I posted on my Facebook page.  I go, my little boy said, God damn it today.  And he said, he totally gets that fucking shit from my husband. 
[01:42:30]  That fucking shit language from my husband.  So a little bit of a potty mouth, yeah.  A little bit.  But I really try and keep it in check.  It's just sometimes there's no better word.  Fuck's a great word.  Yeah.  There's no better word.  It is.  People should get off their ass about it, too.  Right.  Fuck you, man.  It's a fucking great word.  We were talking about Breaking Bad and how it's so good to have these networks now that  allow real gritty language like that. 
[01:43:00]  Because years ago, you had TV shows, detective shows, or whatnot.  And it just took that edge off of it.  Dang it.  Yeah, yeah.  Gosh darn it.  Talk like that.  Oh, darn.  It takes away from the character.  Absolutely.  It's distracting.  They would talk like that.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Hank character is great.  And for the entire series, you're just like, come on!  Although you love Walter, you don't want him getting caught, but you don't want Hank looking  like a total idiot. 
[01:43:30]  But he doesn't.  No, that's just it.  How amazing is that?  Great writer.  You haven't caught him.  He's a great writer.  And it's so...  Clearly, you're smart.  Your character's smart.  Thank you.  Your character's so smart.  Fuck, I need that.  Like, I need that from you.  Thanks.  Oh, I thought it was really stupid.  Thanks for, like...  Well, they do sound married.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to tell you you're handsome anymore.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  I'm not sexy.  No, I'm not.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  I can't help it.  Yes, you're sexy, Dean Norris.  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:44:00]  You're so sexy.  But seriously, how great is that writing?  It is.  That you can have this whole cat and mouse thing.  It's amazing.  It works for both of you.  Right.  I always thought that was really...  Because he got me so close.  And it made sense that he didn't quite get...  And he figures out Gus Fring, and he figures out some other things, you know.  But I thought it was...  And sometimes it's funny.  There's one scene that's not a very popular scene, but where I'm almost kind of catching  him, and Walt kind of squeals up next to me, and he kind of distracts me, and he does  his little kind of Malcolm-in-the-middle thing.  Yeah.  The Malcolm-in-the-middle guy. 
[01:44:30]  He's like, hey, God.  I was like, wow, what the hell is this guy, you know?  Yeah.  But so there are times where it's funny that Hank doesn't catch him, and other times it's serious.  But I always thought it was good writing that they got him out of it.  I do like when he pops in with that Malcolm-in-the-middle character every so often.  He does.  It's so goofy.  It is.  And then when you think of how ruthless he is, it makes it that much better.  Yeah.  One of my favorite scenes is when you're loading up the bags in the car, and you say, what'd  you get in here?  Yeah.  A million bucks in cash.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Right.  So funny.  Yeah, or when you notice the W.W. 
[01:45:00]  The first time.  And he just goes, you got me.  And it's like, no, it is him.  Yeah.  Come on.  Did you really want to be killed off in the first season to do a comedy pilot?  It wasn't the first season.  It was, I'll explain that.  They picked up the last season, and it was 16 instead of 13.  So we go, okay, great.  They're going to shoot all 16, and then we'll be free to do other stuff.  And then the corporate, can I say douchebags?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:45:30]  What are they going to do, fire you?  Yeah.  Fuck them.  So these douchebags decide that they're going to split it into two eight things for their  own financial purposes.  Sure.  They're giving a fuck about my financial reasons.  So I've got to sit there and wait a whole year, because I can't do anything else, because  I'm contracted, to do a measly eight more episodes, right?  So I'm like, you know, I've got a few kids to feed myself.  And I said, wouldn't it be great if the cliffhanger of the first eight, since you're going to  do it this way, Hank dies, that way it frees me up to do another show? 
[01:46:00]  And, of course, they said, no, because we need you for the last eight.  And I'm glad they did.  And they ultimately did free me up in time, and you too, to do another show.  But originally, that wouldn't have been the case.  Then you'd be sitting on your ass for another year, waiting for another pilot.  That's got to be frustrating.  So I was like, you know, I mean, I love the show, and I'm down with art and all that  stuff, but, you know, I act to live.  I don't live to act, you know what I'm saying?  I love that.  You're such an opposite of some of the people we've had through this.  You've been getting paid the whole time? 
[01:46:30]  I would do anything I stood for four years in the desert just to do the last eight episodes  of free.  I don't care.  I'll starve.  I'll starve.  I'm like, fuck it, man.  I need another job, you know?  Hey, me.  It's called Under the Dome, CBS, baby.  Yeah.  Under the Dome.  Blockbuster, motherfucker.  That's huge.  That is huge.  You were in fucking Total Recall.  I know I wasn't.  You were?  No, no, not you.  Before my time.  You got a lot of nerve shit on your face around here, Houser.  That's before my time.  Look who's talking.  That's the one. 
[01:47:00]  You got a lot of nerve shit on your face around here, Houser.  Who are you in Terminator 2?  Will you do your Arnold Schwarzenegger again?  Believe it or not, I think I was probably the highest paid per line because I had like  one line and I was on that movie for like two months.  This is back in the day when they would take like, you know, they didn't give a shit.  Caraca was throwing money out, you know, and we're like, oh, wow, you're paying me to  sit here for a month in a hotel?  Great.  Then I go and do one line, you know?  I forgot what the line was.  I'm a SWAT team leader and I show up and I point the gun at somebody and say something  like, don't do it or something. 
[01:47:30]  How much did you get paid per word?  I'm saying if you had two months to pay for, you know, one word.  That ain't bad.  That ain't bad.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  What else have you, like, what did you early on work on?  Anything we'd know?  I didn't dig in.  Thank you.  Not you, Jimmy.  You can find it.  I know.  Thank you for that.  If you know what I'm saying.  Mostly it was old video.  Some people call it adult films.  I call them art.  That's how I met Dean.  I win.  Oh.  And he said, let me get you on the show. 
[01:48:00]  A little show I'm doing on cable.  I did mostly, you know, I did some movies, but it's smaller indie movies.  I did one movie with Blythe Danner and Peter Fonda, which was really fun.  Oh, wow.  And then I did just a lot of drama on TV.  Yeah.  And it's like, once you start doing drama, people choose that, and then you just do more  of it.  But it was really fun to do, so that's what I did.  Were you on some Lifetime movies?  No.  Where the husband, all of a sudden he's the greatest guy in the world, and then, oh boy.  Uh-oh.  And the best friend always knows he was a scumbag. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  No, I never did anything like that.  But what I am, I am disappointed I never did that show with David Caruso.  Uh, NYPD?  Uh, no, no, no, no.  CSI Miami.  CSI Miami.  Oh.  I did NYPD Blue.  Yes.  The first season with David Caruso.  Yes.  And I had a, and I was ready to go.  That was one of my, that was my first serious TV gig.  And I had a contract to go for the second season, and I'm like all excited, and all of  the summer I hear fucking Caruso decides that he's going to quit. 
[01:49:00]  And do movies.  And do movies.  Jade.  Ooh, that worked out for him.  That was a good one.  Oops.  That was the worst decision.  That was worse than fucking McLean Stevenson leaving MASH.  That was a bad, that was a good one.  That was probably the worst decision in all of you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of them.  Oh, I don't know.  It's one of them.  Because I was his best friend, so my like six episodes I was going to do the next year  was...  Yeah, your character all of a sudden becomes irrelevant.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Wow, that is a track.  And that was early on when that mattered, you know, and that would have...  Yeah, you're probably like, well, that's it, I'll never act again.  Yeah.  I'm probably going to get another gig in my car. 
[01:49:30]  No, half the time I've been in L.A., I've been on Breaking Bad.  Wow.  Not, yeah.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  That's crazy, that's the most of it.  So I've really been in New Mexico.  Yeah, I know.  For a time.  Betsy has to go.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, Betsy has to go.  It sounds like I'd have to pee.  You have to go.  I have to go.  Why does she have to go?  Is it my bubbles?  She's still got bubbles to pop.  You're very, you're a busy girl.  She has to go.  You're promoting.  Promoting.  What's the name of the Michael J. Fox show?  Michael J. Fox show?  It's called Michael J. Fox show. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We just went out there and we were like, hey, let's call it the Michael J. Fox show.  You know, this woman right here is the new Lucille Ball.  I've been telling her that for the last five years.  Yeah.  You always did say that.  I did.  And I love that about you.  After Michael J. Fox, it's going to be like the Betsy Brand show.  I do tell Mike.  I say, you know, for the Michael J. Fox show, I really thought it would be a lot more about me.  Yeah, it should be.  And it will be.  Like, I want more dancing on the show because there's really no dancing on the show.  You do that chocolate thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the chocolate's going by. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  And Lucy's shoving the chocolate in her face.  I step on the grapes.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Stepping on the grapes.  I'm getting a vat of grapes in and I'm going to stop on it.  And then you get all starstruck by celebrities.  Right.  Yeah.  That's great, right?  You try to break into their houses in Hollywood.  I do.  I do get starstruck.  I met Linda Lavin in the kitchen of the Beverly Hilton this weekend.  What?  There's a new gun in time.  I thought she was.  I thought she had passed.  Oh.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Linda Lavin?  Oh, hold on.  No, I'm thinking of the other one from the one with Schneider that was on the show. 
[01:51:00]  Are you thinking of, yeah, Bonnie Franklin.  Bonnie Franklin.  Different person.  Bonnie Franklin.  I know.  No, because I was always into the Linda Lavin, the Alice theme song that she sang.  It's like, not only does she star in the show, she's singing the theme song.  I didn't know she sang the theme song.  Yes, she did.  Oof.  It's so bad.  She's like all like jazz club.  There's a new gun in town and she's looking good.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'll see that show. 
[01:51:30]  You'd think the guy had a fresh second face in the neighborhood.  And it's like, you'd think they would be like, maybe we should get someone else to sing this.  Do you think I could sing the Under the Dome?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  Did you make that happen?  Oh, I can make that happen.  Under the Dome.  Under the Dome.  There's a new Dome in town.  Who indexes the Dome?  So you could see.  Is that a...  Wow.  Bomaroonie.  I actually thought that was a serious question. 
[01:52:00]  No.  For a moment, I did.  I did, too.  But that's funny.  Oh, thank you.  Wait, is there a scene where birds fly into the Dome?  I like that they have TVs everywhere.  So you can tell me what's TV while I'm talking.  It's awesome.  She's really got to go on.  That's a funny comment.  You're dragging her on here.  That's funny.  But MasterCard is up by $12.  We check our stocks.  And there's that guy.  Who are we?  S&P above $1,700.  Oh, Betsy Brandt.  Betsy Brandt will be looking for you in Breaking Bad and the Michael J. Fox show.  You're going to hate your next interview that you go to. 
[01:52:30]  You're going to hate it.  Yeah, it's not going to be as good as what they just did there.  Yeah, bring the...  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  You've got to take breaks?  Oh, man.  Real fast.  Can you stick around?  Is there...  Why is this shit now?  He's good to stick around.  No, yeah.  I wasn't even supposed to start until...  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.

Moving right along, it's the Worst of the Week countdown, 
[01:57:00]  highlighting everything wonderful that happened on O&A this week.  I'm Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live,  and of course, the Sam Roberts Show, Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern,  right here on the Opie and Anthony channel,  which will feature Howie Mandel this week.  Very exciting.  We'll get to Anna Gunn in a moment.  She plays Skylar on Breaking Bad.  She was on the show in a moment.  At first, the Insane Cloud Posse was in studio for the very first time on Opie and Anthony this week,  and it was so exciting because the Insane Cloud Posse are just ridiculous. 
[01:57:30]  I don't understand how anybody could have real venom towards these guys.  They're a very hated group, but it's just like they're just goofs.  Like, just enjoy the ridiculousness of the whole thing, the pageantry of everything.  I think Opie and Anthony did.  They came by and they just talked about everything.  They talked about being self-made.  They talked about everything that they do, and they were wearing clown paint.  There's a picture of me posing with the Insane Clown Posse.  They have the paint on.  I have the clown hair.  It's on my Instagram and Twitter, which are both at NotSam,  if you want to see what they look like. 
[01:58:00]  Insane Clown Posse on the Opie and Anthony show.  We used to do a lot of road shows, and we'd get the girls to flash,  but you get, like, totally nude women to just walk around the whole time.  Let me just say, having attended every gathering,  it's top-quality nudity girls.  Top-quality.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure you've seen that in the photos.  We saw some top-quality and saw some, you know.  A couple of their friends that came along.  What?  What? 
[01:58:30]  All I've ever seen is the highest of standards of the gathering.  That's the way we like it.  And nobody, nobody, you know, on a real tip, everybody's accepted.  I mean, you know, you can be a 600-pound dude walking with your shirt off in the heat,  and nobody's even going to double-take.  Take it from me.  You're watching a lot going on.  I've peeled my shirt off plenty of times.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And nobody's done a double-take. 
[01:59:00]  So much is, you know, said, holy, you know, everything's always been great.  So you're saying nobody should be self-conscious about being not perfect physically,  because nobody gives a shit.  Not together.  It could be the most hideous broad in the world, you know.  Right, right.  Just asshole naked, you know what I'm saying.  There's going to be a dude there like, what's up?  Exactly.  A lot of sex going on.  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  That's pretty fucking cool, too.  I know a porn girl who is obsessed with you guys, and I'm obsessed with her.  She only does, like, lesbian porn, so she won't let me near her pussy, but she's fucking sexy. 
[01:59:30]  And she goes every year, and she says she's totally naked.  And she's like, it's really weird.  Like, nobody touches you or does anything shitty.  And she's like, one guy grabbed her, and then she's like, other people jumped in and, like, fucking smashed him.  And she's like, it's oddly respectful when you're naked.  People aren't fucking that big of animals.  That's why I walk around naked.  That's all their way of hoping to get some pussy.  Yeah, right?  The white knight fucking guy.  Hey, leave her alone.  And he's fucking got his dick out. 
[02:00:00]  The one that wants to save her.  It's already hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shit.  But I'm just amazed that you got it to the point where they walk around naked.  Like, it didn't start out that way.  You had to slowly ease into that.  Well, yeah.  It's a badge of freedom, you know.  It's a way, even if, you know, even if these people aren't the type to normally do that,  you know.  It's a way of saying, man, we're free this weekend.  We're free for these five days, four days, whatever it is.  We're free.  And that's, you know, that's why you get people who maybe not normally flaunt their titties flaunting 
[02:00:30]  away.  Because, man, they just want to wave that flag.  You know, they just want to take advantage of the opportunity.  I can do this, so I'm doing it, you know.  And how many people will attend the festival in four days?  You know, we were talking about this the other day.  It swings back and forth, you know.  One year it'll be about 6,000.  The next year it'll be 16,000.  And then we'll put together a killer lineup and we'll be like, this year it's easily going  to be 20,000 and then it'll go back down to 6,000, you know what I mean? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah, no fucking wrong reason.  And it goes back down to 6,000.  So it really don't, it's just wildly different all the time, you know what I mean?  And it's impossible to get an exact count because so many people sneak in.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a campground in the middle of absolutely nothing.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to, you know.  You're not going to fence off a whole friggin' area.  Crazy acres, you know.  How did you choose that place?  Because they say this is in the middle of nowhere.  It's hard to get cell service.  What made that the place, you guys?  That's really, genuinely is the middle of nowhere. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, straight up, man.  I'm talking about, man, 30 miles west of nothing and 45 kilometers near bomb testing sites.  It's way in the middle of fucking boonie tunes.  And that's another part of the freedom, you know, because it's not even near civilization.  Cell phones go out 30 miles around the gathering.  Wow.  People complain about other festivals where they don't get internet.  Cell phones. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, you're using it.  You can't have no cell phone technology.  You can't have none of that flavor.  It's like primitive living, you know what I'm saying?  Really?  Yeah.  Damn.  In this day and age, not to have your cell phone for four or five days.  People freak out.  Yeah, yeah.  Your fans have to love you.  Some people freak out over it.  What are some of the events at the festival for the people that don't know?  Well, just saying one thing about the cell phones.  Yeah.  Strangely enough, there's this stone pig.  It's like a statue.  Yeah, that's right.  I forgot about that. 
[02:02:30]  And if you stand on top of the pig and lean down and stick your finger in its butthole,  you will get reception.  And I'm serious about that.  I'm serious.  On all the grounds, the only place you got to go to sit on a pig or stand on it, stick  your finger in the butthole.  Wow.  And you get a signal.  Strangely enough, it's a reception.  It's wonderful.  I'd like to see that happen.  Good to know.  In case of emergencies, you are covered.  Right, right.  In case of emergencies, stick that finger in the butthole and you'll be all right. 
[02:03:00]  Did you guys, did you fucking do everything yourself?  And at what point did you say, like, enough with worrying about record labels and the industry  and the business and we're just going to make this happen with just us?  Like, what happened that got you to that point where you just kind of said, fuck  it, let's do this ourselves?  Because every label we've been on, you know what I'm saying?  It's the same old story.  You know, they don't know how to market us.  They don't know what to do with us and all that shit.  You know what I'm saying?  So, you know, I mean, we've been on mad different labels, but we never got kicked off a label.  We always found a loophole to get out or something.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:03:30]  When you're marketing something like that.  Right.  So, I mean, nobody knows how to do it but us, you know?  So, we're just like, all right, who needs that?  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, fuck it, I'm making a movie.  You're like, fuck, let's make a Western.  Well, you know, they want to promote it, but there's no, you know,  why make a video?  Nobody's going to spin it.  You know what I mean?  No channels are going to spin it.  They never have, you know?  Right.  And they want to be able to support.  No radio stations are going to play it.  You know what I'm saying?  So, it's like, how do they do that? 
[02:04:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Nobody understands how to do it but us, you know?  Even if we had meetings and tell them, they'd never do it anyhow.  They wouldn't do it anyway.  Right.  Right.  So, you guys just do it now with being online in the last 20 years.  I mean, it's gotten better and better and better.  So, it's like, it's got to be, it's harder in 1989 to pull off viral stuff.  It's like a fucking videotape.  Right.  And now you just upload it and it's so much easier to not depend on the industry.  Let me tell you about the 1998 days.  Physical work, brother.  I'm serious.  Physical.  A lot of form, man.  Samplers. 
[02:04:30]  Samplers.  Pressing up samplers.  All right.  Physically hitting the town and looking for the strips where all the cars are bumping  up and down the avenue and handing them out left and right.  You know what I'm saying?  Going to the high schools at 3 o'clock and when the bell rings, I have every exit covered  and hitting them up with samplers.  So, every kid coming out of the high school is getting a sampler.  And then pack those vans up and roll to the next town the next day.  So, you're there in the morning, you're there at night and out of these high schools.  You know, thinking of where the most people are going to be so you can hand out  these samplers, that was honestly how we did it in the early days. 
[02:05:00]  You know, flyer and sampler.  We used to look forward to New Year's Eve just because we knew the clubs would be full.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We could flyer more and we can get more flyering done.  You know, it was like relentless.  You know, that was the way we did it.  And so, when bands ask today, how do you do it today?  You know, it's different because a lot of the technology we used to do is gone.  I mean, it's the other way around.  Right.  We used to literally spend like 48 hours straight at Kinko's. 
[02:05:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  You'd have to go to the print places.  Fucking.  It's like, what do you need Kinko's for?  Show shit under windshield wipers.  We lived at Kinko's, man.  We had all the benefits of Kinko's.  That's fucked up, man.  You paid your dues.  You really paid your dues and fucking did all this legwork that a lot of bands don't have  to do or wouldn't be willing to do.  And had you just depended on the industry, they might have let you guys go away.  It's great that you didn't fucking let that happen.  We've been let go away plenty of times, you know what I'm saying?  Like, just sent, you know, just figured, ah, fuck them, you know?  But we always find a way to, you know, keep it moving. 
[02:06:00]  And truly, it's a lot of beauty to be an underground.  You know what I'm saying?  And I mean that.  When you're underground, your destiny is in your hands.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Think about it.  You know, not to say anything's wrong with Kid Rock, but think about being like an artist  like, well, Kid Rock's different because he's at that multi-huge level of stardom.  Right, he's at that crazy level.  But think of you, you're in a band, right?  And MTV picked up your new single, you know?  You just were released this year.  You got a hit single.  You're in effect. 
[02:06:30]  You're touring.  You got this hit single.  Everybody's looking to see who you are.  It's all in effect.  Then next year, or the year comes after that, it's time for your new album.  You better hope MTV or whoever is in the same mood they were two years ago when your CD  comes flying across their desk because they might be like, fuck this band.  You know what I'm saying?  And you're done with after that.  Wow, yeah.  You have no backup plan.  You know what I mean?  Once somebody somewhere, once some bigwig says, I don't want to fuck with it, you know,  or I'm not feeling that no more. 
[02:07:00]  You know, my little sister used to play that shit to death.  Got me bored.  No more of that.  You know what I mean?  That's it.  You're done with.  But at least when you're underground, when you're doing it yourself, it's all up to  you how successful you want to be.  Only there's a cap.  You can't be too successful, but at least you can survive, and that's a definite.  You know you can get out there and pound the pavement and hit the road and stay on the  road and stay at work as long as you need to to be relevant and to maintain and to be 
[02:07:30]  part of the industry.  And it's hard, hard work, but at least your fate is in your own.  And it's not up to somebody else who's having a bad day and says, fuck them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're bummed out from there.  Next thing you know, your record label drops you.  It's just not happening like it was a couple years ago.  You know, sorry.  Right.  And it sucks because you had nothing to do with it, whether that shit was good or not.  Doesn't matter.  How often are you doing stuff for the band?  Is it every day? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We have a building.  Every day.  We have a building with 34 employees in one of them and another building with, I believe,  six employees.  And it's all day, every day.  What kind of stuff do they do on a regular day?  Because no one really knows the business of this, you know?  It's crazy.  I mean, we got like a video department.  We got like a graphics department.  We got four guys working in the video department.  And they're putting together the infomercials.  They're putting together the regular commercials. 
[02:08:30]  You know, they're putting together our videos.  They're putting together little...  We got merchandise about us.  You know, we got a whole warehouse just for printing merchandise.  You know what I'm saying?  Not only do we have a web store that ships and orders from anywhere in the world, you  know, but we also have a web store down the street that actually creates the shit, you  know?  The screen printing, the web embroidering, all of that shit.  You know what I mean?  So we do everything.  And then you go upstairs, we got people who run the websites, not only of insaneclownposse.com, 
[02:09:00]  but also all the other groups on our label, you know?  So we got a hardworking gang of people.  And every morning, we sit around this big presidential table.  You should see this motherfucking table, man.  I don't know where we got it, but it had to be straight out of the Oval Office.  This motherfucking is big.  Presidential table.  And it's huge.  And everybody sits around it.  We kind of go around the table.  Everybody talks about what everybody's doing.  That way, everybody can give advice to everybody. 
[02:09:30]  Everybody's kind of involved in everything going on.  And it's just that.  It's every day, man.  It's hard work.  How long have you guys been at it?  Since 1989.  Wow.  Over 20 years.  And you guys met in Detroit.  Did you guys come up with any of the other ones we know?  Like Eminem?  All of them.  All of them?  Yeah.  You're all about the same age?  Well, Eminem was a little bit different.  You know, Kid Rock.  I know you guys didn't really like each other.  Well, Eminem.  Didn't see eye to eye.  Eminem kind of came up a different.  Yeah, a whole different route. 
[02:10:00]  Because in Detroit, when we were coming up, that was like the big thing was, you know,  pressing up your own records, going around, putting them on consignment, whatnot.  You know what I'm saying?  Doing it all yourself.  Right.  He was more like, you know, battle rapping in a circle and, you know, sending out his demos.  Right, right.  You know, he was taking the approach, which is fine.  There's two different approaches.  There's, you know, prove yourself that you can sell records by doing it on your own and  fuck waiting for a record label.  Just get out there and grind and press up, you know, get your first 500 bucks and press 
[02:10:30]  up your first 500 cassettes.  Sell those and try to order 1,000 cassettes, you know, that route.  And then there's the other route where you're, you know, you're entering the freestyle battles  and you're showing you got skills and talent and you're out there grinding, trying to get  discovered.  Right.  Yeah.  Which is another smart way to do it, obviously.  And so Eminem's circle was in a circle that we weren't really a part of, you know what  I mean?  We didn't hang out at the places they hung out at.  We didn't really do the shows with the people they were doing shows with. 
[02:11:00]  It was just different, you know?  Mm-hmm.  But Kid Rock was heavily a part of what we were doing.  Yeah.  Kid Rock was out there grinding years before, you know, he made anything happen.  And he was grinding.  He was, I mean, he deserves everything he's got in reality, you know?  And he's not even our friend.  We're just saying that.  Right, right, yeah.  I mean, I don't like him.  I don't like his music, but I got to respect him.  You don't like him?  No.  No, no.  Why?  You know, even back in the day when we were all coming up, you know, he was just a big 
[02:11:30]  head kid.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  But, you know what I'm saying?  But I got to respect him like crazy because of, you know, the grind he put on before he  blew up into a megastar.  No one handed it to him.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what was the problem with Eminem?  Well, you know, the first time we ever met him, he came into a club.  And it was kind of like, it was a hip-hop night at the club, you know?  And we don't normally go there anyway. 
[02:12:00]  And he was, you know, we usually be outside of the clubs flying.  Yeah, we never was just in clubs hanging out, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But for some reason, we were up in there that night, and he came up to us and gave us a  flyer, and it said...  Now, mind you, didn't nobody know who this guy was.  I mean, you know, he didn't have a name out there or nothing in New York, you know?  We never heard of him.  We might have heard of the name or something, but that was it.  But he gave us a flyer, and it said, come to Eminem's record release party, you know,  and special guests, maybe.  And it said ICP, Kid Rock, and Esham, who were like the three top names of Detroit at 
[02:12:30]  that time.  And it said, maybe, you know what I mean?  They had question marks after.  And I was like, why do you got a name?  Why do you got a name on there like we might be there?  And he was like, cuz, you might be there.  I'm asking you now.  Yeah, well, fair enough, you know what I'm saying?  That's not a bad way to promote it.  It's kind of ballsy.  We might be like, well, maybe Dr. Dre will be at our shit, you know? 
[02:13:00]  So, I mean, it's true, we might have been there if everything would have been, maybe we  would have hit it off that night and been cool, you know?  But we were just like, man, don't promote our name on there without talking to us, you  know?  That's just kind of shitty, you know?  And then next thing you know, he was blowing up, and he was doing little interviews around  Detroit, and he was dissing us in the paper here and there, and saying they don't count,  clown rap don't count, which is pretty much how we've always been treated.  You know, clowns. 
[02:13:30]  I take this shit seriously, you know what I mean?  To this day, we don't get taken seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, why should we?  You know, we love it now.  We love not being taken seriously.  Was there a point where you wanted to be taken seriously, or did you always just say,  fuck it?  I think in the beginning, we probably wanted to be taken seriously, yeah.  But, you know, we have no complaints of where we're at now.  No, I wouldn't doubt it. 
[02:14:00]  But did you ever think of, like, along that line, did you ever think of, like, kind of,  like, all right, we should change this because they're not accepting it?  Not out of, artistically, we don't care, but, like, fuck, man, this is frustrating.  Before, you actually went off and did your own thing.  Nope.  Never thought about changing nothing.  You know what I'm saying?  That was just the path that was on, you know?  And, you know.  We were so driven, man.  Yeah, big time.  We thought what we were doing was so fucking fresh, man.  It was guaranteed to hit, man.  And it was.  I mean, in Detroit, it's like, we were, like, megastars in Detroit.  You know what I'm saying?  And once it started catching everywhere else, that's where it started, you know, people 
[02:14:30]  were, like, uh, you know.  Because you got to understand, in Detroit back in the day, you know what I'm saying, back  in, like, the early 90s and whatnot, everybody that was coming out of Detroit had some kind  of stick to them, some kind of gimmick.  You know what I'm saying?  One of the guys on top, his name was Esham.  You know what I'm saying?  He was, like, a satanic guy that rapped about the devil and shit.  You know what I'm saying?  On stage, he'd, like, come out of a coffin and all that shit.  You know, it'd be set up like a graveyard and all that, you know.  Then you had Kid Rock.  He was, like, the hillbilly rapper.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:15:00]  He would be driving a tractor in his videos, you know, with a cowboy hat on him.  And everybody, even, like, kids that were, like, barely even known or whatever.  You know what I'm saying?  Would wear a pumpkin mask or, you know what I'm saying?  They'd be doing whatever.  You know, everybody was doing that shit in Detroit.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like wrestling.  They had, like, a gimmick, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  That was what Detroit was doing back then, you know?  And if you think about it, if you really think about it, a lot of the rack throughout Detroit's history has been like that, too, you know?  Even if they weren't from Detroit and if they had a gimmick, they did well in Detroit. 
[02:15:30]  Like Kiss, like Alice Cooper, you know what I mean?  If you were doing some old outrageous, crazy shit, Detroit loves you.  Why Detroit doing the outrageous stuff?  Probably because it's outrageous and crazy to live there.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like a nuclear war zone there, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of outrageous acts that came from Detroit.  Yeah, that's Kiss's biggest market.  I think that was the first one.  You guys still out of Detroit, or have you moved on from living there?  Well, you know, we live way out, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:16:00]  But, yeah, it's still, you know, south-eastern Michigan.  Yeah, we live in Detroit, but we don't live in the city.  We live on the outside.  Is the city as bad as they say?  Too early falling apart?  I mean, it sucks, yeah.  There's good parts.  They try, like, you know, building up some of the shitty parts, but there's just too  many shitty parts to stay on top of, I guess.  You know what I'm saying?  My beef with Detroit is, you know, everything's divided by races.  Like, one street will divide, you know, white people and black people. 
[02:16:30]  One street for miles, you know?  It's insane.  I mean, on the east side, there's a city called Grosse Point, which, like, butts up against  the Detroit, and there's actually a fucking wall separating that suburb from Detroit in  people's backyards, you know what I'm saying?  It goes right to the fence, but a fucking, like, nine-foot-tall wall, you know what I'm  saying?  It's insane.  So these rich people got this huge wall in their backyard, you know, and over that wall,  it's like a ghetto neighborhood, you know?  Uh-huh.  And that wall runs for miles and miles.  It's just fucked up, man. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  That's my beef, because once we started traveling, we started to see that, you know?  Right, you'd be, like, at a nice restaurant or something, you know what I'm saying?  Like, in the middle of a neighborhood somewhere, and you'd be, like, oh, we must be, and you'd  be, like, in, say, I don't know, Dallas or something, you know what I'm saying?  And you'd ask the waitress or whatever, you'd be, like, where are we at?  She'd be, like, in Dallas.  Well, I understand that, but, like, what city outside of Dallas?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you actually in Dallas?  Like, oh, man.  This is weird.  You know what I'm saying?  I didn't see the wall.  What happened?  You got a Friday's in Dallas? 
[02:17:30]  You know, because we didn't have shit like that in the city.  Yeah, yeah.  There wasn't no malls or Bennegan's or no shit like that in the city limits.  What were you doing before the band?  No 7-Elevens in Detroit.  No.  No.  No, they'd just be ravaged, I would gather.  What were you doing before the band?  Did you work?  Oh, yeah, we were, well, the first, I worked over 50 jobs.  I mean, you name it, I did it from car wash to dishwasher and all that shit.  Uh-huh.  But our freshest job was pro wrestling, you know? 
[02:18:00]  We were wrestlers, and Shaggy was my manager for the most part, but he was also a wrestler.  Yeah.  Did you guys come close to making it in that world?  Well, later, we went to WWE, and we had a run there as ICP, but it wasn't because we  were great wrestlers, it was because of ICP, you know?  I remember that.  I wish I could sit here and say, yeah, we did, we made it because of our wrestling skills,  you know?  And we also went to WCW, too, which was a dream come true, you know? 
[02:18:30]  We could brag about that shit forever.  But back in the day, before ICP, we were wrestling around the Midwest, you know, taking bookings,  you know, for 75 bucks, get out there and only get paid 15 bucks.  15 bucks for taking some fucking bumps all night?  It was like 20 people, you know what I'm saying, in a high school gym, or the BFW hall.  Wow.  Goddamn.  He was an independent wrestler for a second, man.  Right.  And sitting in the dressing room with big, fat, naked dudes with like hairy balls hanging 
[02:19:00]  20 years old, right?  There's an 80-year-old guy with his like, oh, dick, just chilling.  80-year-old balls looking right at you.  I'm just sitting there and saying, hey, come over here, let me give you some advice.  Come here, sit out.  You're like, no.  Just come burst and asshole make it.  Who does that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead, sit right there.  You just can't put some underwear or something on, guys?  It's really easy to put underpants on.  It's really not that much of a matter.  I think I almost stepped on your balls.  Oh, wow.  Don't worry about those.  I can't feel them.  Fuck.  Fuck, man. 
[02:19:30]  You guys, wow.  So, yeah, wrestling was the shit.  Worked fucking hard.  Man, that's no, you know, man, we love the fact that we did wrestling.  You know what I mean?  We love every hardship, man.  We're so happy.  We're so proud.  You got to understand, when you come up with nothing, it doesn't take much to make you appreciate  happiness, you know?  If you come up with little, it only takes little to make you feel like you made it, you know?  Well, how little did you guys come up with?  What kind of families did you come from?  Pretty fucking little. 
[02:20:00]  Really?  It goes to nothing.  It goes to nothing, yeah.  Food stamps, powdered milk, you know, little.  Hunger Barrel.  Hunger Barrel money used to...  Hunger Barrel food used to come to our house, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The charity organizations there.  I mean, real rock bottom.  That one outfit for the school year.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, man, yeah.  That's it, man.  When we were little, little, it was like, but listen, man.  You don't realize it when you're a super, you know, small kid.  No, it's just life, yeah.  Like, as a kid, you're just like, oh, this is kind of... 
[02:20:30]  We had the best childhood possible, though.  We had the best childhood.  I mean, that was going on, yes.  And that was weighing on our mom's minds, you know what I mean?  But we had the best fucking childhood possible.  We were off exploring in the woods.  We were making the best out of every situation, you know?  And honestly, man, my childhood was...  I wouldn't change a thing about it, man.  You know, it was so fun and hanging with each other and each other's brothers  and the four of us doing things, man. 
[02:21:00]  We just, you know, we conquered the world by the time.  So you knew each other your whole life?  Yeah, pretty much.  I was like 10 years old.  Really?  Wow.  But it wasn't bad when you found some money.  No, no, no.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That made being poor a lot easier.  But for a long, long time, though, every little bit of money that came  went back into the pot.  Nice.  Back into the pot, back into the pot, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  You guys just believed, because at any moment,  there was a chance it wasn't going to work out for you. 
[02:21:30]  Well, it was like everything was going back into the pot.  Right.  And then once more and more money was coming into the pot,  you know, little things started becoming like, you know,  like we would be making nothing, right?  But every once in a while, we'd ask our manager,  hey, man, can I get a new pair of shoes?  And once those guesses became easier and easier, you realize, oh, okay.  But what was the first big thing you bought where you went, oh, fuck.  A pair of shoes.  Those fucking shoes.  Those $50, those fresh-ass $50 hookups were pretty fresh. 
[02:22:00]  You know, like we were like, this is rap money.  This is fucking rap money right here, man.  High-fiving each other.  You got to stand.  There was like, especially back then, there was no big lump sum of money that came in.  So there was no person who was like, man, we made it.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, okay, you finally get a used shitty car.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Slowly, it just, you know, we'd come in.  We lived in, we had a $250 apartment with a transvestite who hung out on the front porch. 
[02:22:30]  And we, like a homeless transvestite, and we lived in an area called Cass Corridor, Detroit.  And we lived in one apartment, me and Shaggy and Billy, and then my brother somehow.  This is a one-bedroom apartment.  You know, and we were right next to each other.  And once again, you know, does everything suck?  It's supposed to.  But we were just so focused and dedicated on what we were doing.  It was awesome, man. 
[02:23:00]  And when you have the right people you're hanging out with, like, that you could just laugh about shit.  It doesn't matter.  It makes it down much better.  Yeah, yeah.  We'd bring girls over to the house.  We'd be like, yeah, we're broke.  You know, we'd try to use that as our...  That's fucking, that's your in?  Yeah, we're broke.  We'd try to spin it out.  And you know, what, you're too good because we're broke?  You know?  No, it's not like that.  Nice and guilt fuck.  Yeah, you know.  I actually remember that game.  Oh, you're too good for us?  I could spit that game today.  I remember using that shit. 
[02:23:30]  Did you guys have bad management at all?  Like, did you ever have a point?  Every artist, musically, seems like they go through that thing where the fucking managers  steal their money.  Did you have to deal with that at first?  Or did you, were you able to kind of avoid that?  Our manager was never a stranger.  You know what I'm saying?  It wasn't just somebody we hired.  You know what I'm saying?  It was always...  You know what I'm saying?  We've only had two in our whole career.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  Yeah, two managers.  The first one was the guy that started off everything with us, and the second guy is  our lifelong friend.  You know what I'm saying?  And our first manager came at us about 10 years ago or something. 
[02:24:00]  You know, we've been around 22 years, and he came around us maybe eight years ago, and  he said, look, man, you know, we got platinum and gold albums on the wall.  We pretty much accomplished everything we set out to do.  When you guys came to me and asked me to be your managers, it was never my goal or dream  to be a manager, you know?  I agreed to do it then, and it was interesting, and we did it, and now we've done all this,  came all this way.  You guys are doing really good.  You know, I'm going to step out. 
[02:24:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I'm going to step out because I want to do something else in my life as well.  I did this.  This was your guys' dream.  I'm going to step out.  You know what I mean?  He stepped out, and then it wasn't, you know, wasn't a couple, wasn't until a couple  years later when we put our friend, who's now our manager, Billy Bill, in position that  we found out he left with millions and millions.  Oh, your ex?  Oh, my God.  The ex manager?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  How did he do it? 
[02:25:00]  That's all right, man.  It's all good.  How did he do it?  He was a snake.  He left us with a lot of bills he never told us about.  You know what I mean?  Oh, God.  A lot of manufacturing bills.  See, we always knew he was a super-duper, like, venomous snake.  You know what I'm saying?  But our whole thing was, but he's our snake.  He's snaking for us.  You know what I'm saying?  That's right.  We knew he was filthy, but we figured he was filthy for us.  Right, right.  He bit you a little when he was slithering away, huh?  Wow.  So do you guys, now you're probably more in, like, managing your money and being, like, 
[02:25:30]  because you seem like good business, man.  Like, you guys know what you want, and you know how to get it done.  So now you're probably more focused on, let's, you know, keep our eye on everything  so no one can do that again.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the guy that's with us has been with us from day, day one.  You know, he was in our squad.  He also dropped out in ninth grade.  Right?  We all used to do a, when we were kids, we all used to do a paper route together, you  know?  And so we've been with him forever, you know?  And then, like, the guy out there managing us today on the road, that's my brother, you 
[02:26:00]  know?  He's been with us from day, obviously.  You know?  Yeah.  We got a very small, close-knit family.  The people at the office and all those employees and stuff like that, you know, a lot of those  are friends from the past.  A lot of them aren't.  But we don't let anybody get too close.  You know what I'm saying?  We keep everybody in good positions when they're happy.  And we don't want anybody to grow mad or salty.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  If you guys want to shoot something, this is a question I have, because I have all these 
[02:26:30]  ideas of these things.  It doesn't come to fruition.  Say you say, let's shoot this video.  I want to do this.  Do you have a guy in your camp that just will kind of put everything together, like a production  guy?  Like, you'll say, hey, whoever, we want to do this.  Make it happen.  And he lines up everything and says, okay, well, if you want to do it, I got the crew  and we'll do it.  Yeah.  Yep.  His name is Brian Kuma.  And we'll go right to him, just like you said.  You know?  We want to shoot a video for this song.  Get the location.  And he'll be like, he'll grab his pen and get all excited.  And then we'll be like, he'll be like, what do you want to do? 
[02:27:00]  You know?  Do you have any ideas?  And he'll get all excited and geeked up.  And then we'll be like, yeah, we want to, you know, if we have any, if we don't have any  ideas, we'll be like, come on, man.  We just, you start thinking about it, you know?  And then he'll start thinking about it.  Come back a couple of days, got some flavor on the mind, you know?  But that, man, we got a lot of really, really, really bomb-ass employees back there,  man.  We were really blessed, man.  Super blessed, you know?  Have you gotten into any brawls with anybody that you work with? 
[02:27:30]  Like, sometimes, you know, are you close like that?  Friends working together, kind of mix it up every so often?  No, absolutely.  Never had to punch anyone in the face?  Not as far as people that, you know what I'm saying?  Right, right, right.  As a matter of fact, there's an old psychopathic rule, you know?  An old psychopathic rule.  If you fight with anybody...  True shit.  If you're about to get into a fight with somebody, you're mad enough where you're about to fist  fight.  And the other guy wants to fight, too?  You both have to get naked and fight butthole naked.  And grease up. 
[02:28:00]  Therefore, suddenly, you're two men running around naked with each other.  That deterred a lot of fights.  I can imagine.  If you want to fight, you can fight like that.  You know what I mean?  That's hilarious.  That way, we're laughing at both of you while you're doing it.  Yeah, no shit.  Sam's a big fan.  You got a question there, Sam.  Yeah, I could ask you questions all day.  On the wrestling thing, where was the toughest locker room to deal with?  Because I would imagine, you know, you guys said you come in not because you're great  wrestlers, because you're the ICP.  That probably didn't sit well. 
[02:28:30]  WWF was, you know, that was the most, like, trying for us.  You know what I'm saying?  Because everybody that was in WWF or WWE now, whatever, it's supposed to be called.  Yeah.  But, you know what I'm saying?  They were like, well, you're not wrestlers.  So, you know what I'm saying?  You'd be getting punched for real and stuff.  We had some drama in WWF.  But are you talking about that?  Well, they didn't like that you had some heat, so they're going to make it hurt a little  bit, right?  We got into it, yeah, in WWE.  I mean, like, a lot of wrestlers didn't respect the fact we were there. 
[02:29:00]  Right, yeah.  So they would go over backstage what we were going to do, and then when we got out there,  it was fight time.  Wow.  You know, and that wasn't it with everybody.  That was only with the guys that were our age.  The legends, like the road warriors or something, you'd get out there and it would be easy as  hell.  They would be cool as hell with you, you know?  But if you were fighting, wrestling some up-and-comer group your age, did they feel like you're  threatening their spot?  Look out, man.  Anyone you would name? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  They would give you the beatdown.  No, I mean, do you name names or no?  Anyone that gave you a good beating?  There are friends now.  Yeah, we're friends with them.  You know, groups like, for wrestling fans, the Headbangers, we went toe-to-toe with the  Headbangers, you know?  Oh, man.  And then they would come busting in the dressing room after the show was over and be like,  how was it, guys?  And we'd be like, good.  Wow.  It was great.  Because we didn't want to bitch, you know what I mean?  We didn't want to sound like pussies, you know?  So we'd be like, it was great. 
[02:30:00]  It was great.  See, the whole thing with, like, me and the whole wrestling thing is I can't stand being  in the wrestling locker rooms.  They're, like, horrible to me.  You know what I'm saying?  Number one, the nudity.  You know what I'm saying?  Not the nudity.  But, you know, I just hate the whole politics of, like, you know, behind-the-scenes politics  of wrestling.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just crazy.  It's, like, everybody just, you know what I'm saying?  Especially, like, when you got TV involved, you know, just backstabbing and hating on  each other for, like, 30 seconds of TV time and whatnot. 
[02:30:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Think about this.  It's crazy, man.  It's crazy.  Let's say a wrestling show is two hours long, right?  A concert is two hours long.  A wrestling show, you got 20 wrestlers all jocking for position.  You know what I mean?  They all want that shine.  They go out there.  They only get the spotlight for a little bit.  As for if a band goes out there and they can play by themselves for an hour.  But wrestlers go out there.  They got 10 minutes at the most to shine.  So they want to, you know, backstage it's all, like, you know, a lot of conniving and, 
[02:31:00]  you know, shucking and jiving and people wanting to, you know, stab somebody for that spot,  man.  You know, Greg, it's funny.  The show you guys have on Fuse, it's called Insane Clown Posse Theater.  And they asked me to do it and to go on.  And I didn't recognize Greg Valentine.  I didn't realize that was the hammer.  Oh, of course.  Until he came, I was, you know, at first I thought it was like some guy with a wig 
[02:31:30]  who's pretending to be a lady.  I'm like, who is that?  And then when he guides me off at the end, I'm like, this is fucking great.  I think I even said that you're Greg the Hammer.  I couldn't fucking believe you got him to just stand there in that silly fucking hat.  It was unbelievable that he was a part of that show.  Yeah, man.  He was the first guy we called, you know.  He's got the perfect face.  We figured, you know, we wanted the character where something funny goes off and everybody's laughing  and then you cut to the guy who doesn't find it funny at all. 
[02:32:00]  That's the face.  What a better face than he is.  You know what I mean?  He's perfect for it, right?  Nothing's funny about that shit.  However, he's laughing all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not the kind of guy that, you know, that's just nature.  So that's cool, too.  You know, we love him however he comes, you know.  There goes the light.  Go ahead.  You're on the air.

All right, you did it.  You feel accomplished?  You made it to number one on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  If you missed any of this, the countdown replays throughout the weekend, 
[02:37:00]  but you should be listening to the show live every weekday morning, Monday through Friday, starting at 6 a.m. Eastern.  The number one bit from this week's Opie and Anthony show is Anna Gunn.  Skylar White from Breaking Bad.  Walter White's wife.  A lot of people hate her.  We'll find out how she deals with that and a lot more.  For I've been Sam Roberts, and this is your number one bit on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number one.  We've got Anna Gunn walking into the studio. 
[02:37:30]  Hi, Anna.  Take a seat.  Make yourself comfy.  Thank you, dear.  We're actually on the air.  Do you mind if I eat a little bit?  Oh.  Eat.  Go ahead.  Are you sure?  Are you hungry?  I'm kind of hungry.  I'm feeling peckish.  I'm a little hungry.  She's a beautiful woman.  I don't know.  I've been eating in front of her.  Look how matters.  She's a bright orange.  I wanted to, you know, wake you guys up a little.  Well, that you did.  We're awake.  That you did.  Thank you.  Of course, Skylar. 
[02:38:00]  Hello.  From Breaking Bad.  I mean, I've been fully immersed in the show since the beginning.  And what do you say?  Because I've got to bring up, everybody seems to want you dead on the show.  Not everybody.  Not everyone.  Only those who, you know, who identify with...  Go ahead.  I just say it's a tribute to your acting.  Thank you.  Because, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, boy, she's kind of getting in the way of things. 
[02:38:30]  That's what it is.  I think it's the people who really identify with Walt.  And, you know, that's the point of the show.  I mean, that's what's brilliant about the show.  People really get behind the story of Walt.  And they get behind the idea of a guy who's been really pushed down by life.  And disappointed.  And has had to take a lot of things that he didn't want in life.  And I think that Vince wrote him so brilliantly and Brian plays him so brilliantly that people root for him and they cheer for him. 
[02:39:00]  And he is both the protagonist and the anti-hero at the same time.  Yeah.  So it's such a brilliant construct.  And then, in a way, Skylar is kind of the antagonist because she's the one who stands in the way of him doing whatever he wants to do, most of all.  Right.  And that makes some people kind of pissed off.  Yeah, because, like, the viewers, they see someone like Walter kind of progress through the show from this schleppy kind of guy. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  And very realistically and gradually, he turned almost out of necessity for every instance of evil that he does.  Yeah.  It's almost like, well, he wouldn't do that.  And then, well, I guess he has to now.  Right.  Kind of gets caught up in it.  I know.  So much.  And, yeah, you get in there, the voice of reason to a point. 
[02:40:00]  And people are like, hey, get out of his way.  I know.  What are you doing?  Exactly.  It's really bizarre.  And we were at first, the writers and Vince and I were like, what is going on?  Why are people so upset?  But it really is, I think it's really about that, that they just want him, they put themselves in him and in his corner so much.  And she is the one more, I mean, even more than the villains in the show, like Gus Fring or Tuco or any of those really bad guys who, for a while, were bigger threats than anybody else. 
[02:40:30]  She's the consistent one who says, this is not okay.  You can't do this.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's the one who kind of stands there and says there are consequences, there are repercussions.  And that makes people upset psychologically.  It really gets in there and does something to them.  And it's kind of brilliant that it's created.  It's kind of brilliant.  It's amazingly brilliant.  Yeah.  Because, again, as a viewer, you almost want to see how far Walter is going to go without somebody holding him back. 
[02:41:00]  Exactly.  So you sit there and go like, oh, God, this guy's getting in it again.  I know.  Why make him stop?  Don't, you know.  But isn't that what kind of prevents us from becoming like a cartoon of somebody is the fact that in real life you do have people in your way or you do have people in your ear.  And it's like, without that, all of a sudden, it's just like a Superman.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Like, how would the issue?  He would just go off the rails.  And I think it would become, you know, kind of ridiculous.  And I think Vince knew that.  Yeah.  And the other thing was that Vince, from the beginning, he said, I don't want you, like, whenever, I'm a pretty emotional person and I'm a pretty, you know, I play, I'm very, emotions are very much on the surface for me. 
[02:41:30]  So when I first found out, for example, about his cancer diagnosis, tears jumped to my eyes.  And Vince very specifically said, Skylar is not a person where emotions come to her easily.  They're very, they're, they're, they're deeply buried in her.  So it was important for him, for her to be a really, really kind of strong, steely person. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And that's what he wanted from her.  And again, that also sometimes makes people feel like, I don't know if I like that because.  They think bitch.  Yeah.  And that word gets thrown around.  And that's a little tough, you know, that's a little tough to handle because you think, why is that bitchy?  She's actually just a kind of formidable, strong person.  And why is it bitchy to just be strong and to stand toe to toe with a man and say, it's not okay. 
[02:42:30]  It's, it's so odd to have a show where a lot of the before Waltz getting into making meth wasn't shown.  But you could see the result of what your lives were during all those years of him just being the teacher, you being the housewife and mother.  And you could see, without even having to show it, what it produced and set it up so we could get into the, you know, the unbelievable craziness of what happened. 
[02:43:00]  Did you have a backstory that you had to kind of, here's what your life was?  Yeah.  I mean, Brian and I talked a lot about it because there wasn't much there.  But we really kind of created this idea of what drew these people together.  And certainly there was, we felt a real attraction and a love between them.  But we thought the thing that probably was the, the biggest attraction between them was their intellect.  I think Skylar is as smart as Walt, as, as intellectually smart as he is. 
[02:43:30]  She is his equal in that.  And so, and it's also both, it's their downfall as, as human beings, really.  I mean, they think they're kind of smarter than everybody else.  Than everyone else.  Well.  You know, so that's why in a way, as the show goes on, they become almost like the Macbeths in a way.  Because they think that they can outsmart everybody else.  They think they can create these lies and these scenarios.  And to a point, they have been.  I mean, you know, obviously things changed with the, the last half of the last season coming up. 
[02:44:00]  This is it, obviously.  Yeah.  I was, I was so lucky.  I got an advance copy of the first episode of this.  Did you?  I loved it.  Don't worry, no spoilers, people.  That was nice of you to put it online, too.  Yeah, right.  People are saying that.  They're like, come on, put that up online.  I'm like, you don't think I want another one, maybe, at some point?  Exactly.  Be like, here's another one.  I am not saying anything. 
[02:44:30]  But it, it is totally in line with everything that, the magnificence that's been the show up till now.  The beginning kind of showing you a little advance view of things.  Yeah.  Because they've done that before in the past.  And, um, and then the way, the way Walter, the character, Walter can explain something to somebody in a way that is so soft and yet just punches you in the face. 
[02:45:00]  Exactly.  Is, uh, and obviously, you know what scene I'm talking about.  Yeah.  It's just, because he pulled those shenanigans with you in one episode.  Yeah, he did.  Where it's like, hey, you know, you best, you best know who you're talking to kind of a thing.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When he does that thing where he's, he's talking to you and you're, you're drawn into him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you, you think, oh, okay, he's really saying something sincere.  Yeah, he's going to apologize or he's going to show any regret and know.  Yeah.  It's pretty much a threat.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Because you're starting to lean into him thinking, oh my gosh, he's so sincere.  And then all of a sudden he turns it.  And he does that thing, you know, with his eyes when he gets all Heisenbergian.  Yeah.  Where he suddenly does this.  Heisenbergian.  He gets Heisenbergian.  And he does that little thing with his eyes where all of a sudden, and even acting with him,  because I, you know, obviously I know Brian really well and he's a great guy and he's funny and, and, and sweet and lovely.  But all of a sudden he does this thing where his eyes just narrow and they get hard. 
[02:46:00]  And even acting with him is a little bit like, I'm, I'm going to back up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just going to take a little, take a little step back.  He's a, he is an amazing actor.  Amazing.  To pull this role off also.  So, and then we've had him in before and I was talking to him about how it's so odd to see a little bit.  He denied it, but you could see it when he's kind of, because there are parts that are actually funny in the show.  Oh, yeah.  And it's almost part of that Malcolm in the middle dad.  A little bit of that comes through. 
[02:46:30]  Absolutely.  At times.  And I think that's, I don't know him, but I would assume he's kind of like that in real life.  He is.  He's got a great sense of humor.  He's got a great sense of humor.  And those long, intense scenes that we had to do together, you know, those are, those are pretty rough to keep up for 12 hours a day.  So there was a lot of laughing and pranks.  I wouldn't doubt it.  And practical jokes, yeah.  And you were both in Seinfeld.  We were both in Seinfeld.  We were.  We have that.  Yeah.  Dr. Watley.  Exactly.  And you were in the one with the glasses, George's glasses. 
[02:47:00]  I was.  And he had the wrong glasses and insisted that it was Jerry's cousin.  That's right.  Kissing somebody.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be the police woman kissing her horse.  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  He kept saying, but my cousin looks like a horse.  Yeah.  It was the best.  Oh, it was fantastic.  I watch the show all the time.  So anybody that's on Seinfeld, I'm just like, ah, it's the best.  How do you feel with the show ending?  That's got to suck. 
[02:47:30]  It's really bittersweet.  Right.  I mean, this, this, we wrapped in late March and we all had a good cry, but we knew that  we were going to have this kind of farewell tour in a way.  And so we knew we were going to have all this time to spend together.  But now that this is actually coming to an end, we've had some panels.  We had a New York Times panel last night and we all kind of started tearing up and a little  bit of crying in public now because it really is coming to an end. 
[02:48:00]  And we know that this time together is truly coming to an end.  And that's, that's hard because this has been the luckiest job of all of our careers.  We know that.  And it's fantastic that you could take, um, I guess five seasons.  Yeah.  It ends up being, uh, and not, and stop it where people want more.  Obviously people want this to continue, but to make that commitment to know this is what  it is, is, uh, it's brave.  It's very brave. 
[02:48:30]  It's brave.  Cause obviously you could milk a show until there's nothing left.  They do it all the time.  Yeah.  Um, but it, it seems like the perfect length for this to turn around and, and from talking,  what does six seasons be the perfect, uh, six, one more, one more, one more, like it  is six.  Cause five, five and a half, five and a half, five and a half, like six.  Um, I know that just from having done like, like little teeny episode work and stuff, you  get attached to people quickly. 
[02:49:00]  Like you form a weird bond with people.  You do see if you're there for more than one day, it's like you see each other craft  services and you're like, all of a sudden like, yeah, your pals.  And then they go on to much bigger things and they feel no connection, but I can't, but  I can't imagine doing season after season with the same people and then having to call  it quits.  It's a rough way to, it's rough.  It's true.  But the last day when I wrapped Brian and Aaron and I had a group hug and there was a little  bit of crying, but then Brian said, you know, just think in six months we won't remember 
[02:49:30]  each other's things.  Oh, he's such a funny guy.  Aaron, there, there was a great scene with you guys when Aaron was eating over the house.  Oh yeah, that was the best.  That was one of the greatest scenes.  How uncomfortable you guys made it.  It was so great.  He's just babbling about something.  He's babbling about something.  Walt just looked at me and you're just so angry.  So angry guzzling my wine.  Yeah.  Just drinking at that point.  And, uh, but everything fits so well.  The writing is done so well, uh, on that show. 
[02:50:00]  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  And I loved an Aaron looks, he's sitting in between us, like he's the uncomfortable kid  between the few parents just looking at us like, Oh God, I wish it was anywhere else  in the world.  We had to stop ourselves from cracking up the entire time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he ate so many green beans that at the end of that scene, he said, I'm never  going to eat a green bean again.  Oh really?  A few takes?  Yeah.  Quite a few.  Now are you, have you looked at other scripts and stuff since this ended or like?  Yeah.  I'm getting a lot of really interesting, um, scripts. 
[02:50:30]  I'm looking at a lot of movie scripts right now and I, I went to, uh, the Sundance Institute  this summer and I did the director's lab and I did this really interesting role that  was kind of like a female Walter White kind of character.  Yeah.  It's the psychological portrait of the making of a zealot and it's a, but it's the female  kind of version of that.  So that was really interesting.  So hopefully we'll get that made this year.  Yeah.  So you want to do a movie as opposed to, would it be hard to do something episodic right  now?  Cause you're just coming off this.  Yeah.  I mean, I, I'm looking at some, some television stuff as well, but I'm really interested in 
[02:51:00]  doing some, some film and I'm also a big theater girl.  So I'm looking at some theater projects as well.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's amazing what can be done, um, off of network television.  Yeah.  That's why I would assume it's probably hard to be offered something on a network where  it's like, you know, I was just able to read dialogue that was so realistic and, and  to go to episodic, um, network television has got to be rough.  Yeah.  I mean, this is some of the best writing that any, any of us have ever encountered. 
[02:51:30]  And when you come off of writing like this, it's the bar is so high.  So we're, I mean, it's just so lucky, but then you're kind of spoiled.  So you have to choose carefully.  So, um, but, but it's opened a lot of doors for all of us.  So we're in, we're in a good place.  Now, obviously, you know, you can't tell us anything.  Um, um, I'm going to tell you, so nice, um, all of a sudden Vince Gilligan comes 
[02:52:00]  in and tackles me.  You will be quiet.  Yes.  Um, uh, would there, let's say, would there be any even possibility there could later  be a reunion of sorts?  I think that's possible for sure.  Oh, I mean, it depends on, you know, what happens in the last day.  Yes, exactly.  Who's still standing and all that.  But you know, there is talk about the Saul Goodman spinoff, so. 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  Who is a great, another just great character.  Amazing.  A little comic relief in there.  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's good.  And by the way, he was in a Seinfeld episode.  He was.  Another Seinfeldian.  I just, and if you think I'm bad, our producer, Travis, ten times worse than me.  He can quote all of them.  My father can quote every Seinfeld episode.  It's just that.  Talk about another just brilliant show for the time and everything.  I know.  Yeah, but they went more than five seasons.  See, you can make it.  Oh, yes. 
[02:53:00]  Nine seasons.  Yeah, they did.  They did.  Well, I guess for the comedy, it's a little bit easier than with an actual drama with  a real story.  Yeah, you just keep going.  You don't have to worry.  I thought the scene, the episode where Jerry becomes a meth dealer was great.  It was, uh, that would be interesting.  Maybe you guys could all, like, do something together as a cast, but just a totally different  story.  Oh, my.  Could you imagine?  You know what?  Somebody said that at the New York Times thing.  They said, seeing you all sitting up there, it's a shame to see you, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Like, maybe you're a hat distributor.  And Brian owns a hat store.  I love it.  And you guys work on trying to get the hats for certain prices.  That's terrible.  That's a great idea.  What a waste of resources.  I've always wanted a hat.  A dramatic slash comedic slash endearing piece about hats.  Terrible.  Get Ben Gilligan on the phone.  The one thing that has been going around the internet, which was kind of funny, is the  thing that, uh, to say Walter goes into witness protection program and it becomes Malcolm 
[02:54:00]  in the Middle.  Everybody thinks that.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody.  And who's to say that that doesn't happen?  And who's to say that that isn't what...  Well, I, I, I, like I said, I saw that first episode.  And, uh, if that's any indication on the rest of this, I mean, it's, I just sat there when  the credits came on.  I, I, I yelled out, no, I know, I know more exactly.  It's going to be, it's going to be sort of agony every week for the audience to wait to, 
[02:54:30]  to the next, for the, for the next week.  And now I get the good thing that I saw the episode, but now I got to wait two episodes  to see the second one.  Oh, you got to wait two weeks, right?  But I'll watch that first one again.  Yeah.  That was, uh, and I, I popped the disc in and I'm like, all right, I'm ready to watch  this.  And it comes on and I'm seeing the scene.  I'm like, all right, I got to watch the last one again.  So I had to pull it out because they screw with you.  Yeah.  So I watched last season's last, uh, episode and they're going, because they, they always start  off, uh, these shows with something that you don't think makes any sense. 
[02:55:00]  Exactly.  You're looking at a flower.  You're looking at that.  And this one, you're just seeing skateboards, right?  Skateboards.  And you're like, all right, why am I seeing this?  Did I miss something?  Yeah.  And it all makes sense.  And, uh, it's, it's fantastic.  It's great.  And it launches, I mean, it's like a, it's like the, they don't ease you into this since  you've seen that first one.  Oh, they shoot you off.  Like a, it's like a right away.  You're like, what is going?  And that scene where she drops the growth.  I'm like, ah, that's great. 
[02:55:30]  You're loving that you have inside info.  Oh, it's the best.  You're loving it.  Look at, I love it.  Are you feeling resentful right now?  Yes, but for many other reasons.  Where do we begin, Anna?  You got two hours?  That's great.  Skylar, Anna Gunn, thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you.  You're a doll and a love.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks so much.

Tim from Virginia left a message and said, hey Jim, you know what would be a good idea 
[03:00:30]  for a podcast?  How about all these guys that have man caves?  And you know what?  I never thought about that.  And when he said that, I'm like, that's a fucking great idea.  These guys that walk around, I got a man cave.  And for the last four days, I've been fucking tossing and turning.  I've been jotting down notes.  I've been angry.  I've been taking it out of my family because I'm just thinking of these fucking guys that 
[03:01:00]  have man caves.  And thanks to Tim from Virginia, we are doing this podcast on fucking man caves.  Okay.  I don't know what happened to this society.  I don't know what happened to this generation of men that have to think for them to be a  man, to show that they're a man.  They got to have a man cave.  It's all about man, that word man, because they don't have a fucking set of balls. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  They gave them up.  They're fucking, they don't, you know, they're completely controlled by their, in their relationship  with their wife and a girlfriend.  That's why, you know, you hear words like man cave, you know, a place to go hide.  Or you hear man up.  You know, when a guy doesn't do something that's, you know, not like a man, like a real  man would do.  People go man up.  And then they also, Hey, uh, let's go to Vegas this weekend.  I got my man card for the weekend.  Do you really?  Yeah.  What's on your fucking man card? 
[03:02:00]  Why can't you do that?  Every, why can't you be a man every weekend?  Why just, uh, yeah, well, I got my man cards.  I could be a man this weekend.  Really?  All the other times you can't be a man.  Cause you're a fucking pussy.  That's why.  And that's why guys have man caves because they're a bunch of fucking pussies.  All right.  They're, they basically married their moms.  Okay.  So like when they were a kid, right?  Mom didn't like the house to be a mess.  Right.  So they gave you that little room, your little playroom, right? 
[03:02:30]  So all your toys, your play though, your trains, your dinosaurs were all in there.  Right.  So what you would do as a little boy, you go in there and play and you can write, put  crayons on the, on the, on the table, on the wall.  It didn't matter because that's your playroom.  That's okay.  If you're messy in there, just don't be messy anywhere else.  So if you want to be, you know, you want to do whatever you want in there, that's your  playroom.  No problem.  Just don't bring it into my house. 
[03:03:00]  So now these guys grow up.  They're basically mama's boys, right?  They live with their mom.  They go to college.  They're in college.  They're living in a dorm.  So, you know, they're living with like four other guys.  So they're just complete slobs.  So it doesn't matter.  But then when they get out of college, they probably live back with mom for a little while  before they get a good job and can start paying rent.  And then within like a year or two, they meet a girl or they probably had the one from  college and then they get married because these guys are a complete disaster. 
[03:03:30]  They can't take care of themselves.  They're mama's boys.  They need a mommy.  They need a mommy to take care of them.  So basically what they did is they married their moms because later in life, mom slash the  wife takes over the whole house.  But the husband's like, hey, honey, you know, I know you decorated this and you did this  for this and you did this.  But, you know, can I just that little room downstairs, can I make that into my man cave so I can 
[03:04:00]  go down there and just do man stuff and put stuff in there that's not acceptable in the  house, but I could put it in my own little man cave, which is exactly like his playroom  when he was a kid.  Really?  I could have my own little room like like when I was a kid when I had a playroom.  So instead of Play-Doh, I put up Dallas Cowboy posters, you fucking pussy.  Why don't you just tell your wife, look, man, this is, you know, I paid a mortgage. 
[03:04:30]  I bought the house.  I pay most of the bills.  It's 50% my house, too.  So I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want.  I mean, you're not going to put a fucking, you know, an ACDC poster up in the kitchen,  but you just go, look, man, this is my house, too.  You're not fucking taking over the whole house.  How about you be like that?  Any guy that has a man cave that has to go hide in a fucking little room to get away from  his wife and his kids, it's got some fucking serious issues in the marriage.  Okay, I want to be alone. 
[03:05:00]  Then get in your car and fucking drive around the neighborhood.  Why don't you do that?  Why don't you do that?  What do you got?  You got to go hide in your little fucking playroom slash man cave?  Because your life is miserable.  But I'm a man.  That's the last thing I got.  She's got everything else, but I got my man caves.  Really?  Is that what you got?  Yeah, because I could do whatever I want in my man cave.  Really?  Well, what could you do in your man cave?  Well, you know, I could put pictures, I could put posters up. 
[03:05:30]  I have this poster of this girl.  She's like half naked.  It's like a beer poster.  And she's like bending over and she's really hot.  Yeah?  Yeah, so I'm going to hang that in my man caves.  You know, because guys, we like girls.  We like like half naked hot girls that like beer.  So, yeah, I'm going to put that in my man cave.  Really?  What else are you going to put in your man cave? 
[03:06:00]  Well, you know, remember that famous picture of the dogs when they're all smoking cigars and they're playing poker?  Yeah, I'm going to hang that up.  Yeah, because that's, you know, that's like, eh, dogs.  Yeah, and they're smoking cigars and they've got drinks on the table, I think, and they're smoking cigars and they're playing poker.  That's like, that's a funny picture.  No, it's not.  Nobody's ever, nobody's ever, ever laughed at that.  Ever.  You look at it like, oh, is that the dog?  Oh, poker?  That's, wow, that's weird. 
[03:06:30]  And that's it.  That's the reaction to it.  But yeah, I'm going to hang that in there.  And you know what?  You know what else?  I'm going to put a dartboard in there because guys, that's men.  Because we're men and we're guys.  We like dartboards.  We play darts.  How about you fucking stick the dart in your eye, motherfucker?  No, we like, we're going to, you know, we might even have a dart tournament.  Hey, you want to come to my man cave this weekend and play darts?  No, no, I don't want to do that. 
[03:07:00]  I don't want to go to your man cave and play darts.  You want to come over Friday night and just hang out in my man cave?  No.  You know why?  Because I'm afraid you're going to try to suck my dick in your man cave.  That's what goes on in a man cave.  It's not a man cave.  It's a fucking homo fort.  That's right.  It's a homo fort.  There's a lot of gay stuff that goes on in there.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  I'm not putting down the gays.  I'm just saying these guys that go, oh, man, man, man. 
[03:07:30]  It's gay.  If you're a 42-year-old man and you're putting Dallas Cowboy posters up in your man cave,  there's something wrong with you.  You have fucking issues.  No, but that was great.  It was the 94 Super Bowl.  I put the poster up.  Yeah, because, you know, that was my team.  Really?  That was fucking 20 years ago.  Let it go, motherfucker.  All right?  Stop living in the past.  Nobody gives a shit. 
[03:08:00]  No, but it was, I remember where I was when they won.  Yeah, where were you?  Were you sitting between two of your guy friends pretending you were skiing?  That's what you were doing.  You were jerking off your two guy friends.  No, it's just, yeah, it gets Troy Aikman and then Michael Irvin and Emmett Smith, those three.  Yeah, because I look at it every once in a while.  Yeah, that was a great team.  Really?  Is that what you do in your man cave?  Is that what you do?  You think in there?  Why don't you fucking shut everything down and shut all the power off and just sit there and think about your life? 
[03:08:30]  And think about your own fucking thoughts and just sit there and think what went wrong.  Why am I stuck in this little room downstairs?  My wife's got the rest of the house because I'm a fucking pussy and I got no balls to just, you know, not be, you don't have to be a fucking dick.  You just go, hey, no, I don't need my own room.  It's just pretty much my house too.  If I want to watch the game in the living room, if you don't want to watch it, there's a TV in the bedroom.  Maybe there's something we both want to watch. 
[03:09:00]  That's cool.  I don't need to hide from my wife and kids.  I got a huge basement.  My wife's like, you want to put, you know, any stuff on the walls?  And I go, no, I don't want to.  No, you could put, you know, your heavy metal stuff up or your posters or your sports stuff.  No, I don't want to.  I don't want it to make it look like a sports bar.  I'm a fucking, I don't need to put a Willie McCovey poster up.  That's my favorite San Francisco Giant player.  I don't need, I like the guy.  I don't need to put a poster up to remind me.  I know I like them.  I got to put a Dan Marino fucking jersey up at a fucking frame. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah, that's right, Dan Marino.  I know.  I know.  I watched him for 17 years.  I know.  I don't need a fucking, oh, there he is.  Walk by.  Oh.  Fucking, just fucking, I put my man, man.  What else is in your man cave, sir?  I'm doing this interview.  And whenever I do that fucking retarded voice, that's the man cave guy.  I'm sure you guys figured it out.  Well, what else is in your man cave?  Well, you know, like I put my trophies up from Little League. 
[03:10:00]  You know, when I was 10, yeah, we came in first place and we won a playoff game.  So I put my trophies up.  Nobody gives a shit.  Nobody.  No, no.  It's a good memory.  We had a great team that year.  No, you didn't.  You didn't have a good team.  Okay?  If you had a good team, you would have been playing in fucking Williamsport in a baseball  fucking Little Kids World Series.  That's what you'd have been doing.  You didn't have a fucking good team.  It's just in my, yeah, I remember when I was 10. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, good for you.  Yeah, and you also had your playroom when you were 10, motherfucker.  Back to my original point.  Now, what else you got in your man cave, sir?  Well, I got like a bunch of sports bobbleheads.  You know, I got Derek Jeter.  I got A-Rod.  I got Andy Pettit.  I got Mariana Rivera.  Really?  You got a sports bobblehead? 
[03:11:00]  That's what you have?  You know, the reason their head shakes?  It's because they're looking at you going, you're a fucking grown man that has a doll  on your shelf that shakes.  That's what they're fucking shaking for.  That's why they shake their heads.  You're fucking 43 years old with a wife and two kids and a mortgage and a fucking good,  responsible job.  And you got fucking bobbleheads, little dolls on your fucking shelf in your man cave. 
[03:11:30]  That's why they're shaking.  They're shaking.  What is wrong with you?  Take me down.  Give it to your fucking eight-year-old son.  He should have bobbleheads, not you.  You know, we might even get a pool table.  Why?  How many times are you going to play it?  Four?  All you're going to do is put your fucking clothes on it.  You don't need a pool table. 
[03:12:00]  What else do you have in your man cave, sir?  I got my special chair.  It's a recliner for my man cave.  Yeah, you know, it's really comfortable.  And I got like two fucking holes so I could put two beers, not even one, two.  You know why?  And I got a little compartment on the armrest and I could put the remotes in there.  You know why? 
[03:12:30]  Because I'm a man and that's what I do.  I drink beer and I got a hold right there so I don't even have to get up.  I could just relax.  And nobody's allowed to sit in my chair because that's my chair in my man cave.  So no one's allowed to sit in my chair.  No, that's my man chair cave.  Is it really?  Yeah, and I got a place I could put beers.  And you know what else I have right next to my easy chair recliner? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, what do you have right next to it?  I got a kegerator.  I'm sorry, I don't know what that is, a kegerator.  It's a refrigerator.  It's a refrigerator with a beer tap on it.  You know, so I could just tap the beer and it's already cold because, you know, guys, guys, like, we like beer.  You know, I'm a man and I'm in my man cave so I got to do man things.  And then, you know, we drink beer. 
[03:13:30]  So I got a kegerator right next to my fucking easy chair that, you know, I sit in and I drink beer because I'm a fucking man.  Let me tell you something.  If you have to prove that you're a man by having a man cave, you're really a pussy.  Let me repeat that one more time.  If you have to prove that you're a man by having a man cave, you're really a pussy. 
[03:14:00]  That's what you are.  A man cave means your wife rules the house except that one room.  That's it.  That's the bottom line.  So just put your balls in a jar and put them in the mantle on your man cave.  Put them up there next to your trophies and your bobbleheads and your Dallas Cowboy posters.  What else do you have in your man cave? 
[03:14:30]  Well, I put this one in a little frame.  It's the World Series stuff from 1998 when the Yankees played the Braves.  I was at game three.  Nobody gives a shit.  Nobody cares.  You're hanging ticket stubs up on your wall.  No, but it was a great game.  I was there.  Yeah, good for you.  Who gives a fuck?  It was 1998. 
[03:15:00]  It was 15 years ago.  Get over it.  Now it was an amazing game.  Scott Brocious hit a fucking double off the wall in the bottom of the eighth.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares about that.  You tell that story.  Scott Brocious wouldn't even care.  He wouldn't even remember it.  You could see him at a fucking baseball card convention signing autographs or whatever.  And you go, hey, Scott, I was at that, you know, the 1998 game three against the Braves at Yankee Stadium.  You hit that double off the wall in the eighth. 
[03:15:30]  He'd be like, oh, yeah, really?  I did?  You don't remember that?  No.  How could you not remember that?  Because it's 15 years ago.  I got a life now.  You should, too.  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, my wife, you know, you know, she won't let me put this stuff in the house around the house.  You know, so I got to put her in my man cave.  There's a reason your wife doesn't want that stuff hanging on the walls, because it stinks. 
[03:16:00]  It's fucking awful.  Nobody cares about that stuff.  It's not important.  It's fucking dumb.  Your wife's not being a bitch.  Stop calling her a bitch behind her back.  She doesn't let me do anything.  No.  It's fucking awful.  Yeah, that's why you want to walk into someone's house and see a fucking bunch of bobbleheads.  I like my man cave.  What do you do down in your man cave, sir?  Well, I like it. 
[03:16:30]  You know, I go down there and I get stuff done.  You know, like I could just chill out and, you know, figure out my fantasy football team for the week.  I look at stats on my laptop as I play Mumford and Sons in the background.  Is that what you do?  You play Mumford and Sons while you pick out your fucking fantasy football team?  Yeah.  You know, and I drink a beer, and I got video games, too, because you never know.  You know, I also have a lot of gadgets down there because I'm a man, and I like gadgets. 
[03:17:00]  You know, because men, we like gadgets.  Go fuck yourself.  You know, I got all my video games.  I got Wii Golf.  So I could just go down there and just chill and play golf on my fucking Wii.  How old are you, sir?  Well, I have to do it.  No, seriously, how old are you?  I'm 41, and you're playing Wii?  You're playing golf on your fucking Wii? 
[03:17:30]  Is that what you do when you're playing?  Yeah, I play Call of Duty.  You really?  You do?  You play Call of Duty, and you're a fucking grown man.  Yeah, you know, because that's what guys do.  I'm a man.  Well, how come you don't play it up in the living room?  Yeah, because my wife doesn't, you know, doesn't like when I play video games.  Nobody likes it.  Nobody does.  What else is in your man cave, sir?  I just bought a signed Derek Jeter baseball off of eBay. 
[03:18:00]  I'm going to put it in my man cave.  Really?  Why don't you shove it up?  Why don't you stick it in your ass?  That's right.  That's where it should go.  Just get a big glob of fucking lube and work it right into your asshole.  That's where that ball belongs.  Nothing against Derek Jeter.  I like him.  He's a first ballot Hall of Famer.  But just you fucking went on eBay and bought a ball that Derek Jeter might have signed that you overpaid for,  and you're going to put it in your man cave.  That deserves to be stuck up your asshole. 
[03:18:30]  No one over 16 should have a man cave.  You're 16, 17, 18.  That's it.  You go in there as a kid.  You want to go smoke pot.  You bring a girl in there.  You try to bang her.  You know, you're getting away from your parents because you hate them.  You're a teenager.  I get it.  You want it to the place to chill.  You don't want to deal with them.  You play video games.  No problem.  Not grown men.  I got a man cave. 
[03:19:00]  Ugh.  My dads didn't have a man cave.  What happened, right?  Our dads, they didn't build the room.  They were in the garage.  Maybe they were building shit or fixing stuff because, you know, that's what they did.  They're like, hey, man, fuck that.  You know, we got Mexicans that do that shit now most of the time.  So, like, I'm not doing that.  But, you know, they went in there and they fucking, on the weekends, they built shit. 
[03:19:30]  But it wasn't a man cave.  No.  He just went in there and he fucking put the circular saw on and fucking cut wood and fucking  yelled and cursed and shit like that and put shit together.  That's what he did.  He didn't have his own room with a fucking TV and his fucking sports memorabilia on the wall  and his fucking video games.  Dad didn't do that.  You know why?  Because dad didn't fucking, dad wasn't afraid of mom.  He wasn't afraid.  He wasn't a dick, but he wasn't afraid of mom.  He's like, hey, I fucking live here too.  I'm not going to be sequestered in a little fucking room downstairs. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  That's how it used to work.  I don't need a dart board to prove that I'm a fucking man.  No, but guys, we play darts.  I'm going to be in a dart tournament.  Go fuck you.  Really?  Is that what you're going to be?  You're going to be in a dart tournament?  What else do you do in your man cave, sir? 
[03:20:30]  Well, look, I just go down there.  I can play my music as loud as possible, you know.  I can crank the, sometimes I crank the Fighting Irish fucking Notre Dame song.  Really?  Is that what you do?  Yeah, I crank it because I'm a big Notre Dame fan.  And I got a poster, actually, a poster of the movie Rudy on my wall.  And I look at her inspiration.  Yeah, because every time I watch Rudy, I still cry.  Fuck you. 
[03:21:00]  One of the most overrated movies ever.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah, I cried too when I saw it for the first and only time.  I wasted two hours in this piece of shit.  Oh, yeah.  A guy undersized.  Isn't going to make the team, but at the end he does and he makes a, he gets a fucking sack.  Ooh.  I just summed up the movie in fucking four seconds.  Two hours and four seconds.  Ooh.  Yeah, because there's no, there's been no other inspirational movies.  No.  Just that one. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, because that's never happened before.  An undersized kid that, you know, had long odds to make a team or do whatever.  Actually made it.  Ooh.  Wow.  They like Rudy.  Go fuck yourself with Rudy in Notre Dame.  That's, that's part of my man cave.  I got ND on the door.  Yeah, ND doesn't stand for no dicks because there's plenty of dicks in that man cave and  they're all getting sucked by another man that is another man cave around the block. 
[03:22:00]  That's what they're doing in there.  Your little homo fort.  Because that's what it is.  It's a homo fort.  Because when you were a kid, remember you had your little fort in the background, in the  backyard and you put your little sign up, no girls allowed, boys only.  Well, that's what your man cave is.  Boys only.  Because we're going to suck each other's dicks in there.  That's what we're going to do.  As we look at our Derek Jeter.  As I look at Troy Aikman's ass on the Dallas Cowboy poster. 
[03:22:30]  I'm going to suck my friend's dick in my man cave.  My wife's not going to suck it because she hates me and I don't like her.  So somebody has to.  And we're going to do it in my man cave.  And I'll wipe up, I'll wipe, I'll wipe the load up with a terrible towel that I got from  the, the Steeler fucking Raven 96 championship game.  I took two so I could use one to wipe up the cum. 
[03:23:00]  It's inspirational, the Rudy poster on the wall.  No, it's not.  You want inspiration?  Put fucking, put a picture of Michael J. Fox up there.  That's inspirational.  All right, inspirational.  The guy's frigging got Parkinson's, you know, 20 years ago.  Never bitched about it.  Doesn't complain.  Still works.  Still married to his wife.  Still raises three kids.  That's inspiration.  Put a picture of his wife up there too that stayed with him for 20 years.  That's inspirational.  I'll fucking look at that. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, just that she stayed with him for 20 years.  Look, if my wife got Parkinson's tomorrow, I'd have to leave her.  I got nice China that my grandmother left me.  Antique China.  The shit would be broken two weeks.  I'll be eating on paper plates and fucking paper cups.  I don't live like that.  I don't like shit fucking dropping on the floor.  And that's all she'd be doing.  I would take one last parting hand job.  Because I'm sure that would be pretty good.  If she had Parkinson's. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know how we got on the subject of Michael J. Fox.  He has nothing to do with this.  That's a man I idolize.  Not Rudy.  Rudy.  What else is in your man cave, sir?  This is a long interview.  Well, I just got the new ACDC action figures.  Yeah, it's a Brian Johnson and Angus Young.  Yeah, I'm going to put him in my man cave.  Did you really? 
[03:24:30]  Really?  You're in your 40s and you have action figures?  Well, yeah, but it's ACDC.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a huge ACDC fan.  I have 32 ACDC t-shirts.  Okay.  None of them are hanging on the wall.  They're in my fucking closet.  And every once in a while, I wear one.  Okay.  But I don't have the ACDC action figures.  I don't.  No, but I've got to put them in a man cave right next to my bobble heads.  You don't, sir.  You don't think there's anything wrong with you being a grown man, having a man cave and 
[03:25:00]  putting action figures in there.  No, because I'm a fan of the band.  No, but I understand you're a fan.  I got that.  ACDC is one of the best fucking hard rock band of all time.  I got absolutely, without a doubt.  I'm not doubting you.  But you have action figures.  You're a grown man with fucking a wife and two kids and a good job.  There's something wrong there.  Yeah, but it's my man cave and I'm a man, so I can do whatever I want in there. 
[03:25:30]  Is that what you could do?  Yeah, you want to come?  Come on, man.  You really got to try.  What are you doing Friday night?  You want to come over to my man cave?  No.  Come on.  I'd rather hang out with the Taliban in a cave in Afghanistan.  Seriously, that's what I'd rather do.  I'd rather have a fucking sharp knife to my neck and they're videotaping me yelling shit  in fucking Arab and saying they're going to cut my head off because I'm an American. 
[03:26:00]  That's what I'd rather do on a Friday night.  Be worried that I'm going to get decapitated than hang out on your fucking man cave.  And look at a Derek Jeter bobblehead, a fucking ACDC action figure, a Rudy poster, and a fucking Dallas Cowboy poster as you're playing Wii on your golf.  Looking at your fantasy football stats next to your fucking kegerator and your fucking stupid easy chair, your recliner that holds two beers and your remotes.  That's what I'd rather be doing.  Getting ready to have my head fucking cut off and held up and shown to my family. 
[03:26:30]  That's what I think of your fucking man cave slash homo fort.  I think I covered everything.  I think that was a good ending.  Yes, it was.  So that is it for this week. 
[03:27:00]  Thank you.  We always end the podcast with a little prank call.  And this one is actually a crank anchor's call.  I did a couple characters in there, special ed.  And I also did a character called Bobby Fletcher.  It was just my real name.  I mean my real voice, but just a different name.  So this is one where Bobby Fletcher, I call some kind of drug counseling place about getting a job or something like that.  I'm trying to sell pot to the kids there.  So it's called Bobby Fletcher sells pot to kids. 
[03:27:30]  We will see you next week on the Jim Florentine Comedy Metal Midgets podcast.  Make sure you leave those comments on that page.  Thanks.  And I'm going to go because I'm going to go in my man cave and try to suck my own dick.  Good evening, Alternative.  Hi, I'm calling about the ad in the paper at Alternative Counseling Center.  Job.

[03:28:30]  Okay.  Okay, now, so what is...  This is for the part-time counsel, right?  Has it been filled yet?  I don't think so.  Talking to the phone, you slob.  Pardon me?  It hasn't been filled yet?  No.  I don't think so.  I didn't hear nobody say that it was filled.  Okay, now, this is a part-time drug educator, too, for these kids that are messed up on drugs?  Right.  Right.  Okay, um, so I talked to...  Could you hold one second?  My roommate just came in the room, just one second?  Sure.  Did you get the weed? 
[03:29:00]  Okay, cool.  We'll smoke a bowl in a minute.  Okay.  Uh, hello?  Yes?  Okay, sorry about that.  So what do you do, basically?  Just answer the phones?  Yes.  Yeah, because it seems like you're not that well-educated.  Oh, what do you mean that I'm not that well-educated?  No, no, I didn't mean it like that.  Excuse me.  Miss, I didn't mean...  Listen, oh, no, you're not going to talk to me like that, because I will relate this message to Linda,  and you will not be coming in here.  You will not be talking to me.  Have a nice day.  Miss, I was...  I didn't mean it that way. 
[03:29:30]  Good evening, alternative.  Hi, Gloria, it's Bobby Fletcher again.  You didn't even give me the phone number to call or any information before you hung up.  Listen, you were very rude to me, and that's not nice.  Miss, I wasn't rude.  Yes, you were.  You burped in my ear.  I...  Miss...  You told me that I wasn't that smart.  No, I didn't say that.  Listen, I was talking to my roommate.  He just came...  No, you wasn't.  He came in with a nickel bag full of pot, and he paid $50 for it.  He knows it's only $30. 
[03:30:00]  That's why I was calling him stupid.  I wasn't talking to you.  But would you pay $50 for a nickel bag of pot?  I wouldn't pay $0.05 for a bag of pot.  I wouldn't pay nothing for it, because I don't do it.  Okay, I...  If that's the thing that you're doing, you don't need to be here.  No, well, no, you just...  No, because I've got to relax.  I'm going to talk to these punks.  I need to be a little under the influence.  I'm just going to smoke a joint real quick.  You won't get hired here, B.  We don't hire nobody that does.  No, they're not going to even know.  Believe me, I got Visine.  You know what I mean?  Oh, you're talking to me.  You're talking to somebody that do know. 
[03:30:30]  No, that's...  Hold on one second.  That's way too much pot.  We can't sell a lot to the kids.  That's...  Oh, man.  Oh, you won't...  Gloria.  Oh, you won't get in here, because I see Linda before you will.  I understand.  Gloria, just give me a second to talk to you for a second.  All right, we sell pot to kids.  I can't help it.  No, but that's what we do, and then we get these counselor jobs because these kids get  hooked on pot.  That's how we make our money.  We make money off them from the pot, and then they have to go to counsel, and we make more 
[03:31:00]  money.  No.  All right?  That's what we'll do.  You're talking to the wrong sister.  Gloria, do you know...  Gloria...  You don't scare me.  Huh?  You don't scare me.  I'm not trying to scare you, but I'm just saying...  Oh, yes, you are trying, too.  You do.  But listen at you.  That is so bad.  That is so ridiculous.  Miss...  That is so sad.  Please do not call her with that attitude no more.  Gloria, you sound really pretty.  That is so rude.  That is so rude.  Gloria, you love it.  You know you do.  Please do not talk to me.  Gloria, I'm just trying to get this job.

[03:36:30]  You would definitely bang her on the road.  There's no doubt about it, because we've all been on the road.  I've been on the road with Florentine, and he is probably one of the creepiest motherfuckers  I've ever been on the road.  Wow, what a compliment.  That's nice.  That is a compliment.  Absolutely.  Right.  Who's into the greatness he would do?  Every time we got to a hotel, we would start moving out tables and chairs, and so the  women couldn't sit there.  They'd have to sit on the bed. 
[03:37:00]  You would set up the room ahead of time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's fucking brilliant.  We'd take all the furniture out of the room, because you get a girl back.  They would go all the way in the corner and sit in that little chair that they had.  So where'd you put the furniture?  We'd throw it in the emcee's room, whoever was opening.  Like, you'd chuck everything in there.  That is brilliant.  So you bring them back.  They've got to go right to the bed.  That eliminates that step.  Brilliant.  Yeah, in front of them, sitting in the chair like, hi.  It's a time saver.  Huh?  And what we'd do is, it was a half hour that was out of the game.  We didn't have time for them to sober up.  We always had liquor. 
[03:37:30]  The bathtub was full.  We smelled like dog shit after the first day, but we didn't give a shit.  And fucking, we would bring furniture in the hallway, and people would go, like, are  you going to do that to our room?  We're like, no, we don't work here.  Yeah, we'd have couches.  There was couches lined up in the hallway.  We'd be taken out like movers.  Like, get this one out of here, too.  And if the emcee, we didn't have an emcee, we'd just leave it in the hallway.  Because ships would always go to that couch or that chair.  Yes.  And you can't get them to the bed. 
[03:38:00]  It's a creepy move.  So you're getting rid of two hours easy right there.  Right.  They have to sit right on the bed.  That's brilliant, Jim.  Wow.  What Jim would do was, like, he'd, like, I'd have one, like, with my arm around her, and  Jim would tell a horrible joke, and I would laugh out of control, and I would choke her  backwards onto the bed.  What a move.  We lied to women out in Canada.  We told them we were in bands from England. 
[03:38:30]  We would do shitty English accents and that shit.  And I'm telling you, I'm in a bad, I'm just playing here.  That's great.  And I'm going back.  We were fucking pulling out strippers out of the club.  Jim would call up and go, what time is the last girls go on?  11 o'clock.  Well, stick ready.  We've got to be there at 10, too, because we've got to get them fresh when they're off  the stage for a fresh meet.  Next thing you know, we're dragging out two at a fucking time.  It was unbelievable.  Well, Levy's move with girls after a show was he would give them his hotel room key and 
[03:39:00]  go, hey, come back to my room at 324.  I've got to make a phone call.  I've got to call my son or something like that.  He'd make up something.  Because he didn't want to go to the other bar with them, the local bar where they always  wanted to go party.  Because you don't want to go to, you're going to get in a fight.  Yeah.  Because all those guys in that bar have been trying to fuck her since high school, and  all of a sudden the comedian comes in and she comes in trying to show him off.  It's trouble.  So Levy would go, look, I've got to go back, call my son.  He's been sick or whatever.  So why don't you go back to my room later?  I'm in 324.  Here's my room key. 
[03:39:30]  He would get like five room keys when we check in.  How many do you need?  I need five.  Five?  Yeah, I lose a lot of them.  And he would just hand them out to chicks.  Here, 324.  Levy's like, I'm not doing the work.  If they show up, they show up.  If not, so Levy's like, I waited to jerk off to like three in the morning when I knew  they weren't going to show up.  That was your out time, three o'clock.  So you've got to have a time set.  One time I went down to get another key because I actually did lose it.  And they go, sir, we don't have any more.  Yeah, we don't have any more.  Wow.  That's great.  It was a good move. 
[03:40:00]  And at like a 130 or so, a girl would show up.  And he's like, I didn't have to go buy her more drinks.  None of that stuff.  Yeah, why fucking just bank on one?  And the best thing was one show we did in Baltimore, I get off stage, I'm making out  with this hot blonde within three seconds, Jim.  Remember that?  He just walked off the stage and two feet, he starts making out with us, go in front of  the whole crowd.  Jesus.  So she goes, look, I got to go out with my friends.  We're having a bachelorette party.  So meet me at my hotel room.  I'm in 324 in like an hour. 
[03:40:30]  So I drive Levy.  It's like 20 minutes away.  I drive.  I drop him off.  He goes, all right, I'll see you in the morning.  The chick was really hot.  He gets there and I pulled away.  I'm like, all right, he's good.  I pull away.  He knocks on the door.  This is like trying to be pulling like cell phones, basically.  Yeah, so he has no idea.  So he knocks on the door.  A guy answers the door in the hotel room.  He's like, who are you?  And the guy's like, who are you?  He's like, who are you?  Who are you?  He's like, is Amanda here?  He's like, yeah, she's sleeping.  He goes, well, who are you?  He goes, I just met her a little while ago. 
[03:41:00]  She brought another guy back.  Oh, man.  So Levy shows up and the guy's like, well, he goes, well, I'm not leaving.  And Levy's like, well, I'm not leaving.  So the guy's like, I don't know what this is.  I couldn't get a ride.  He couldn't get a ride.  I dropped him off.  So I didn't have a sitting one before cell phones.  So Levy's like, fuck it.  I'm not leaving.  So he goes in the chair in the corner room and just sits there as that guy goes back  in bed with her.  And then he's like, fuck this.  I'm not doing it.  So then he crawled in bed and he slept with a couple.  I swear to God.  And they woke up in the morning.  The girl's like, Levy's still sleeping. 
[03:41:30]  She's like, who is that guy?  And the guy's like, I don't know.  He said he knows you.  She goes, I never saw him before.  And Levy wakes up.  I was the comedian last night.  What a fucking creep to go into bed with a couple.  That is pretty fucking creepy, dude.  I'm not sleeping in a fucking chair.  The bitch invited me over there.  He's yelling.  It's not my fault.  She's a fucking filthy whore.  I mean, one time Jim's in Canada.  This girl comes up to him.  She uses a guy's name that was probably the stupidest, weirdest name. 
[03:42:00]  I don't know if you remember it, Jim.  It was Curtis.  Curtis.  That's it.  Curtis.  Curtis.  And Jim goes, uh, yeah.  And tell him that story.  What you did.  I don't know.  We're going to somebody's wedding.  We're on their way to the wedding.  She thought I was this guy, Curtis, from some band in Canada.  I think I told the story on the air before.  That's fine.  Tell it again, though.  That's great.  Yeah, so she thought I was Curtis.  She's like, are you Curtis?  I'm like, yeah.  And she's like, you remember me?  I'm like, uh, I think so. 
[03:42:30]  Your hair's a little different.  That's what you always say to chicks.  Because their hair are a little pretty much.  Even the day before, it's different.  Your hair's a little different.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It is.  I just got a, yeah, you noticed.  Yeah, yeah.  Sheesh.  Yeah, sheesh.  I noticed you got the blood stain out of your hair.  You are, you're a magic maker.  That damn blood stain is great.  So, long story short, next thing I know, I'm like making out with her.  And she's like, and she says to Levy, can you believe what he did to me?  Can I tell him?  I go, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  I don't know what I did to her.  Oh, shit.  She's like, I met him.  He was in a band.  I met him one night.  We went back to his apartment.  We had sex.  And it was a blizzard.  It was up in Canada.  She goes, and then he told me I had to leave.  And he made me walk home in a blizzard, like three miles.  And you never called me again.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  It sounds like something I would do.  It is definitely something you would do.  Curtis, Curtis is just as big a scumbag.  I know.  I thought I was working with Curtis, the real Curtis. 
[03:43:30]  It's so easy to, I'm telling you, you should go out of town and just go into a bar and tell  them you're a doctor, you're anything.  You know what I mean?  Why waste time?  You know what I mean?  I wanted to get laid on stage so bad one night, right?  A while back.  And I go, they go, how do you want me to bring you up?  I go, say I'm going to be Joey's cousin, Joey's brother on Friends next year.  They bring me up like this on that.  I got fucking ten women all over me.  I pick one and get out of there. 
[03:44:00]  It is so simple.  It's so money-hung to be fucking whores.  It is the greatest fucking thing.  Holy shit.  Just to think of this shit is brilliant, huh?  Norton would get upset when he goes, I got to come, we're going to get laid and that  shit.  And fucking, he comes on the gig, he's fucking kicking and screaming because just nothing  happened that night.  And Jim actually got a girl, and that's the night that you came up with a great idea to  jerk off on a TV.  That'll teach Jim when he comes home to watch SportsCenter. 
[03:44:30]  And he's both jerked off on the TV, and Jim walks in and looks at him and goes, nice.  And just goes to bed.  Yeah, because we were all sharing a room.  There was two beds and two double beds.  And I went up going out with this girl, and they stayed there.  So to get even at me, they say, we're going to jerk off on the TV screen in the hotel.  And I come back, and I go, what is that on the screen?  And I go, we jerked off.  And I'm like, nice.  And I just went to bed.  Like, it's going to bother me.  Even if it was my own TV, it wouldn't bother me. 
[03:45:00]  I think it bothered me more watching Norton do it than when you see it.  Jerking off on the TV.  I mean, I know.  What did the TV have to do with?  Who comes up with that?  Holy fuck.  That's great.  It happens.  That's what makes our life so great.  When we were on the road, we were called the load warriors.  Who called you the load warriors?  Bob made that up.  It's great.  I don't think people walk around going, uh-oh, here's the load warriors. 
[03:45:30]  This is a good one.  One time, Bob, one time we're doing this gig like in upstate New York,  and this girl was talking to Bob after the show,  and he was sure she was going to come back to the hotel room.  And I knew she was, and I could see the vibe.  It wasn't happening.  He's like, no, she's definitely coming back.  And I was in the room next to him.  And he's like, I'm telling you, she's going to come back.  I go, Bob, she's not.  So I was like, you know what?  I have to do this.  I went to the frigging phone book.  I called the frigging escort service up,  and I ordered a hooker to leave his room.  So like 45 minutes later, I'm almost out sleeping. 
[03:46:00]  I hear this.  He's like, I'm going to go get my pimp, and you don't pay me.  I know your hotel room.  He's like, I didn't know what are you.  Wow.  Wow.  A chicken and a fucking condom. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, fuck.  That's great.  We did all the fucking time to each other.  Like, and that's what made it, that's what made it, that's what made me on the road.  Creepy fuck.  And it was a thing.  People make it seem like it's so fucking hard.  All you got to do is bullshit them.  And it's so simple.  It's not like you were trading quality in, though, for a little bit of quantity. 
[03:47:00]  But, you know, it's the road.  Yeah, it is.  That's the fucking hot chicks, man.  I'm telling you.  Really fucking.  We were pulling strippers out of.  We would get, like, fucking three of them.  How many back in the room?  Oh, yeah.  You remember?  Until you got the fat one the last night. 
[03:47:30]  Wait, what happened?  Wait, boss has the creepiest story.  My favorite story of all time.  He's doing, like, a Tuesday night at Rascals down at Jersey Shore.  Picks this girl up in his little motel.  $60 or whatever, right?  So he pulls and she goes, yeah, let's get a room.  He's like, okay.  So they get in the parking lot.  And they fool around in the parking lot.  So, you know, she must have blown him in the parking lot or whatever.  So now she's like, okay, well, are you going to go get the room?  He's like, yeah, yeah.  So he's walking to the front desk. 
[03:48:00]  He's like, well, I just blew a load.  I don't need to get a room now.  So he's trying to figure out how to get out of it.  So he comes back to the car.  Meanwhile, there's no cars in the parking lot.  It's a Tuesday.  It's one of those motels where you pull the car right up to the doors.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's nobody there because it's a Tuesday.  Nobody's staying at that shitty motel.  It's in the winter in the Jersey Shore, so nobody's there.  So then he comes back to the car.  He's like, ah, they're sold out.  She's like, what are you talking about?  There's no cars.  He goes, no, there's a bunch of buses in the back for some tours, so there's no rooms. 
[03:48:30]  Now walk home in the snow.  Oh, God.  What a creep.  We finally got, we had strippers, like, every night, seven nights, we got them, boom, boom, boom.  The eighth night, we're ready to leave the next day, right?  Nothing.  We can't do nothing.  I look up.  I'm looking for Jim, and I see Jim, what looks like he's standing next to a cigarette machine.  It was actually a woman.  And he gives me this creepy smile and wave. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, man.  We drag her to the room.  You know, we always said we had food or whatever.  We got her into the room, and Jim starts making the train noise, like, we're going to pull  a train.  Like, I'm going to be part of this train.  Oh, God.  We pulled many trains.  There's no way I'm going on that fucking train.  Yeah.  You know?  But, like, in the morning, the guy thought we were idols, the guy that worked at our front  desk.  So Jim told her, he tells her in the car, he goes, I need you to duck, because we're not 
[03:49:30]  allowed to have guests.  He had her duck for seven miles.  And so he wouldn't be seen.  He had...  What a scumbag.  Oh, God.  I mean, that's...  You know what I mean?  That's fun.  I mean, to me, that's fun.  I don't...  Well, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's a long time ago.  You grow up.  Yeah, there you go.  That's always the excuse.  That was long ago.  Of course.  You know, it's like in college years.  You do that stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  You know, I didn't go to college, so... 
[03:50:00]  You get your college in on the road.  Yeah.  Fucking leave.  That's great.  Hey, isn't it going to be great stories for our kids when they grow up?  Yeah, I don't know how to explain that one.  Yeah, how do you tell those?  I'm like, son, look, get a fatty every once in a while.  You want to bust out of a slump.  You want to bust out of a slump?  Yeah, those Canadian women love bourbon, didn't they?  Yeah.  They love bourbon.  We brought one emcee.  We wouldn't even...  Like, we wouldn't get him in another room because he just wanted to come to see his family. 
[03:50:30]  We made him sleep in the bathtub, and he started screaming because the girl wouldn't fuck him.  He's cursing her out from the bathroom.  I mean, it was just a total fucking wreck.  But, like, he didn't care.  I mean, Jim, the first time we pulled the train together, he's like with the girl.  And he's like, take your dick out.  And I'm like, what?  He's like, take your dick out.  And I'm like, what are you saying?  He goes, take your dick out.  And then I took my dick out, and he looks at it, and he goes, I can't follow that. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, Levy's packing, like, eight and a half.  It might have shrunk over the years, but...  But you got a hammer, huh, Levy?  It got bigger.  It got fucking bigger, man.  After every marriage, I make sure it gets fucking bigger.  Is this another ploy?  You go on the radio and tell people you got a big dick?  You guys work, Levy.  He's now using us.  You're the fucking perverted Martin Lewis.  Fucking using us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  How many times have you been...  We used to go on a radio show, and I'd talk about my dick, and he'd go, no, it's huge. 
[03:51:30]  And you'd go, no, yes, it's bigger now.  It's bigger.  Yeah, it doesn't grow.  No.  Everybody shrinks eventually.  How many times have you been married, Levy?  I don't want to brag, but...  How many times have you been up to?  I killed a dinosaur in my dick.  Three.  Yeah, I got it in my yard.  You're up to your third marriage?  Yeah, yeah.  Guess what the good thing is?  She told me, well, it was like, she told me bad news.  Like, she just got...  She works with the elderly.  I guess that's why she likes me.  But she got a raise where she's taken over buildings in Cleveland. 
[03:52:00]  And she goes, I'm going to have to move there.  And I'll be away for six months.  And I'm like, oh, my God, that's horrible.  And actually, I'm just, like, fucking jumping up and down, fucking giggling.  So the marriage is going well?  It's going well.  I think it's going to be better.  I can see, you know, if you live next door to each other, that's cool.  But fucking another state?  How fucking great is that?  Jesus.  Nothing tops this story. 
[03:52:30]  All the stuff that I did, Voss, whatever.  Levy, one of his marriages.  The first day he gets back from his honeymoon.  We have to drive to South Carolina in the car.  So I'm in the car with him for 14 hours saying how he's a changed man.  He's never going to do it again.  He finally found the love of his life.  I'm so happy.  I don't have to screw girls in the road anymore.  I'm going to focus on my career.  I'm going to go right back to the hotel room after the show and write new jokes and get some sleep and get up early and start exercising.  I can't, but, Jim, you don't understand the feeling of meeting your matchmaker, your frigging, your whatever, fucking soulmate or whatever. 
[03:53:00]  He's going, I'm like, all right, enough.  Enough.  You don't understand.  I am just the happiest.  I am so happy.  I don't have to do that stuff anymore.  I don't have to flirt with girls, talk to them.  Oh, true freedom.  Look at that.  That night.  It was the greatest feeling.  That night after the show, he gets blown by a stripper.  Jesus.  What happened?  The day he's back from his honeymoon.  What happened?  That 16-hour ride, I had to listen to that shit, and that night he caved in. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, my God.  That quick.  That night.  You know, you got, hey, look, guys, it was a long ride.  Well, true.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't expect a guy to stay faithful with his soulmate.  You know, it's a long ride.  Not even one that you're just back from your honeymoon.  That's supposed to be the happiest time of your life.  Oh, you just know it's fucking doomed.  I guess a girl likes my tan from Jamaica.  I don't know.  My tan from Jamaica.  Why would you get married three times? 
[03:54:00]  Because I'm one of those people that can't do anything for themselves.  Like, I don't want to, like, get up and do something.  Like, if I tell her, honey, I need premium for coffee, can you go to the store?  Like, I'm one of those guys.  He doesn't, yeah, he needs to be taken care of.  He has to be in a relationship, and he needs to be taken care of.  He doesn't like, he likes them to do everything.  That's a personal assistant support.  Yeah, pack his suitcase and do all of that stuff.  Buy his clothes.  He doesn't like to do any of that stuff. 
[03:54:30]  But the sacrifice.  Yeah, I know.  It's amazing.  Because it's always a mess.  The downside is you're married.  The upside, yeah, you're getting some stuff done, but fuck that.  No, I mean, I like it because she's more normal.  This one's, I believe you both, you know, Jim, and Jim can say that she's, you guys met her, too.  She's very nice.  She's from Cleveland.  No, she's cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  She understands.  I can tell her these stories, and she laughs.  You know what I mean?  We have a comic friend that did the biggest scumbag move, this friend, Artie Fletcher. 
[03:55:00]  Jim knows him.  After his first...  Wait a minute, you called him a comic?  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  I love when they bash each other.  After his first marriage, he's on his honeymoon in, like, Jamaica.  They start drinking at, like, noon, him and his wife.  She gets so drunk, she passes out.  He brings her up to the friggin' hotel suite, meets another girl back at the little tiki bar  at the pool, and fucks her on the beach.  Wow.  On his honeymoon.  On his honeymoon.  She did on his honeymoon. 
[03:55:30]  How did that marriage go?  She didn't know.  She was passed out.  Yeah, it lasted, like, three years.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  That's bad.  I mean...  Why would you get married at that point?  I know.  You can just do that.  You can just do that.  What's that?  He didn't even have a dick.  He used to take it out all the time, and we were like, that's not even a dick.  Yeah.  He's not funny.  He doesn't have a dick.  Yeah, he really doesn't.  Right?  This guy sounds like a blast, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, you're not...
