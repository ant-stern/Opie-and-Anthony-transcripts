<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show, hosted by Sam Roberts, opened with a significant portion dedicated to Roland’s repeated “photobombing” of various photos taken that day.  This included a picture with Chris Evans (Captain America), leading to considerable playful antagonism between Roland and Sam, who repeatedly criticized Roland's actions.  The debate centered around whether the photobombing was intentional or accidental, with evidence presented on-air via the photographs themselves.  Blake Shelton’s presence in the building greatly heightened Roland’s excitement and anxiety, resulting in numerous references to his desire to meet and obtain an autograph from the country singer.  Other staff members, including Troy (the call screener) and Mars (the show’s engineer, whose strange noises while alone in the studio were recounted), were also frequently mentioned.  A “Line of the Day” segment featured listener-submitted offensive phrases from the main Opie and Anthony show.

A substantial portion of the broadcast involved a phone call with the manager of a McDonald’s employee, Leonard, who had worked there for 50 years.  The hosts engaged in a humorous, and at times insensitive, conversation with the manager, culminating in a prank call where they falsely claimed to fire Leonard. The segment concluded with speculation about Leonard's post-prank employment status.

The main Opie and Anthony show's earlier interview with Chris Evans was mentioned, cited as a reason for the main show running overtime.  A brief discussion on the tax implications of gifts followed, prompted by the story of Christian Lopez (who caught Derek Jeter’s 3000th hit ball) and a hypothetical Mets game ticket gifted by Bobo to Opie.  Finally, the show recounted a humorous anecdote about Roland being nearly misidentified as a potential child molester due to his appearance in a park.  The broadcast maintained a generally crude and humorous tone throughout.  A truce was eventually declared between Sam and Roland regarding their photo-related conflict.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is.  See, Eric, the music is nice and loud for me.  I feel like when I come in.  But every morning, Opie's complaining about how low the music is for him.  Interesting.  Do you play it louder for me?  Well, this music is louder than the Rage Bed.  Yeah.  But when you start talking, as soon as this thing kicks in, it's hard to hear you. 
[00:00:30]  That's why I bring it down.  Because I enjoy the volume when it first starts.  Well, you don't have to keep it going the whole time.  Especially not after you've already had it low.  Do you get frustrated that they bring up the volume of the bed?  No, I mean, what they hear in there is different than what I hear in here.  You know what's interesting?  Troy and I were talking about you before the show today.  And it's his opinion.  I mean, maybe I led him to this. 
[00:01:00]  I don't know.  But he was saying that he thinks that one of the tricks that you do is that there are days when you don't want to deal with it.  That your solution to the problem is that you make Troy sit on the board until after Street Fighting Man is done.  And then you come in to replace him.  No, that's not true at all.  You photobomb every fucking picture today.  I didn't photobomb every picture.  Every fucking picture you photobomb.  Well, if people are posing, did I photobomb or did I just happen to be in the background? 
[00:01:30]  Um, if every picture you're smiling with your little smart-ass smile.  I did it to Eric and maybe you.  Yeah, Spencer.  No, I didn't even look at the camera for Spencer.  Yeah, you were at this.  Well, I was actually probably looking at something else.  Was I looking at the camera?  Yeah.  You just said I was looking elsewhere.  No, you're looking right at the camera like this.  All right, show me the picture.  Excuse me, Ron and Fez in turn.  You will be the judge of this.  Look at Roland's camera. 
[00:02:00]  I'm going to zoom in.  Okay.  Is this intentional photobombing?  Which picture are you showing him, Roland?  Which picture are you showing him?  Yeah, that is a...  Because you had me pinned in a corner.  Quite an invasion of the photo.  But you understand I was pinned in a corner, Roland.  Like when you...  Yeah, that sucks.  Oh, who are you talking to?  You bitch.  You had me pinned in a corner.  You had people posing right in front of where I was standing. 
[00:02:30]  And I was talking to them about a live read.  You can duck.  I could have ducked.  Picture that too.  I didn't mean to photobomb Spencer's picture.  I'm not going to say I didn't, you know...  Yeah, you put my Blake Shelton picture.  You will die.  Blake Shelton's coming in today?  You will die, son.  This is why you're so edgy and nervous.  I was about to say, who cares about Captain America picture?  I mean, he was great on the show.  I mean, and I figured that you'd be happy how well the interview went.  Did you know he was a fan of the show?  I did not. 
[00:03:00]  But in the office, I was just at third host, Jim Norton.  He goes, oh yeah, I know.  Oh, really?  And then his phone rang.  He had to take a quick call.  I didn't really think about it.  Yeah, because we had Chris Evans on the show today who played Captain America.  And after the interview was over during the commercial break, he said he's from Boston  and he's been listening to O&A forever.  And he knew Jim was the third.  That's hilarious.  That's awesome.  So the reason you're a little on edge right now, because you come very hostile right now.  Yes.  It's Blake Shelton day today?  He is in the building.  Oh my God.  There's Red River and Blue CD. 
[00:03:30]  He's out today.  iTunes.  Pick it up.  Limited edition.  I was wondering what that tension in here was.  Is he here now or is he still coming here?  He's here now.  He is.  Oh, okay.  Why did you bring him in?  What?  Why don't you get him to come in on the checkbox?  Well, he chuckles.  He's doing a country interview.  You see Eric?  You see the hostility that's in here right now?  No, he's been pissed at you for that photo for about an hour now.  Which photo?  Oh, about half an hour, I'll say.  His photo?  Yeah, with Chris Evans.  He's been stewing in the back office on it.  Stewing.  Well, you photobombed me before.  No.  I'll show you the picture. 
[00:04:00]  Okay, never mind.  He's the demons.  Okay.  Yeah, because I will send you.  In fact, matter of fact, I know that I've had to send pictures to Coke Logic to edit your  face out of them.  And we can get Coke Logic on the phone if you want.  We're not here to point fingers.  You're edgy because it's Blake Shelton day.  I mean, if you're, you know.  You got pictures here?  We can call a truce on photobombing if you want.  Truce.  Eric?  Wait, wipe your mouth and you're doing that.  I don't ruin people's photos.  Jelly around your mouth.  Oh, you don't? 
[00:04:30]  No, but if you want to see a good photobomb, go to Opie Radio on Twitter.  Okay.  You can see Rich Voss with Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and then Roland's hand going right across  the photo.  Okay, so Roland, you've done your shit.  Well, yeah, I photobomb for his hostility towards the guest.  Okay.  Well, my favorite Rich Voss goes, I don't know how far to go with the guest because I'm part  of the Hollywood community.  No, you are not.  I love how, how edgy you are today. 
[00:05:00]  I am.  Oh, did you hear his documentary has John Rivers in there?  Oh my God.  What's your problem with Voss?  Nothing.  I must get my picture signed with Blake Shelton.  Okay, so we have a truce, Roland?  Oh, 100% truce.  Okay.  We have a truce.  But.  I can't be in five with you.  It's just too tiring.  It is.  It's exhausting.  I mean, it's exhausting for me too, Roland.  And you're not one that I would want to take on.  But today is, because for those of you who don't know, Roland is literally obsessed with  Blake Shelton.  I love the music. 
[00:05:30]  Roland's Twitter, Rolando's 99.  He just retweets Blake Shelton's stuff.  Some of it doesn't even make any sense.  It's just stuff Blake Shelton has said.  Yes.  You just find him an intriguing personality.  Yes, I do.  And what, was it The Voice that brought you to your, because he's, Blake Shelton is a  country music singer who's now a judge on The Voice.  Yes.  Were you a Blake Shelton fan before The Voice or was that the exposure?  No, I enjoyed it before The Voice.  Uh-huh.  And then just then, once he was on The Voice, he started releasing more new material. 
[00:06:00]  And you just loved all of it.  I loved all of it.  It's amazing because I've never seen you, this is taking precedence over the edginess  of, I have a big guest in studio today.  Like, usually, when you have a guest, because the Chris Evans booking was a big one because,  you know, he's in Captain America.  His publicists are, you know, not sure about which shows he's going to do here, wanting  to make sure every single thing goes well, you know, and everything is good.  And you were like, you know, oh, I got to make sure. 
[00:06:30]  So that interview goes well.  And instead of just coming in here and being like, hey, what's up, everybody?  You're all going crazy over Blake Shelton.  That is true.  You want a little Blake Shelton music to calm you down?  I mean, would you like that, Roland?  Maybe a little Honey Bee.  Does that make you feel better?  Good job, Eric.  It's starting to make Roland feel better.  We got a lot to do on the after show today.  Maybe Roland wants to sing along with him. 
[00:07:00]  What did you say, Roland?  Why would Clint Cliffs listen to Honey Bee?  Just repeat this song over and over again.  Why not?  Because I mean, Roland, you know what I learned from you?  It's a bet if you're talking over it.  That's right.  Look at the picture that Eric just put on the big screen.  Oh, yeah.  Tap for you.  That's Aaron Paul.  I think I took that picture.  Yeah, look at Voss on his face.  Eric, we should play Line of the Day because we didn't get to it on Opie and Anthony today. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, okay.  So, I know you want to listen to Blake Shelton too, right, buddy?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, we can't.  I mean, I know they play that song Honey Bee on Hits One.  They must play him on a bunch of the country stations here, don't they?  Yeah, that's what he's doing right now.  What is he doing in here?  I think he's doing like an hour or an hour and a half at the highway.  Mm-hmm.  And then he's doing Hits One where he used to be Piff.  You don't like Piff?  What do you think of Piff as an interviewer? 
[00:08:00]  I never heard his interviews, to be honest with you.  Oh, okay.  So, what do you make it?  I've seen those, like, I know I'm fat.  I'm trying to deal with it.  Yeah.  I'm trying to work out.  You are.  But Piff works with these small little children's t-shirts.  You think?  Okay.  And he's got a small child.  Well, you can explain who Piff is.  Well, Mikey Piff, you're right, Eric.  Eric, you are the consummate professional.  You know, Mikey Piff, he works on Hits One.  He's, like, the morning mash-ups producer.  He's the night jock, too, right?  Yeah, and he's the night jock.  Who?  I guess, Roland, your problem, he comes on before me on the overnight jock. 
[00:08:30]  He's the nighttime jock.  Your problem with Piff, I thought you were saying that you had a problem with how he behaves on the air.  No.  Your problem is based on the fact that you think his shirts are too small.  I think the guests stare at him intensely because they want to cut them open so he can breathe.  I'll say this about Roland.  But, you know, you're heavier than some.  Yeah.  But I'll never say that you're wearing uncomfortable clothes.  Like, you always look comfortable, and you don't make anybody else uncomfortable with your wardrobe.  I'm not going to have, like, camel toe pants on. 
[00:09:00]  No.  But Piff, on the other hand, you think too stylish for his stature.  Like, he drops a pin, he'll look at it down the ground and keep on walking.  Because he's not bending over?  He can't.  But that's not all Roland was busting on him was for his shirt.  He was wearing these really, really bad Ray-Ban sunglasses.  Oh, my God.  Walking around the hallway.  He thinks he's Enrique.  Wait, he's walking around the hallway in sunglasses?  Yes.  In Ray-Ban sunglasses.  And this is Mikey Piff, the producer of the mashup.  Yeah.  It was those fancy George Marvel-type glasses where you're like, hey, what's up, bro? 
[00:09:30]  I was like, I'm going to slap you.  They're, like, kind of silver, but they fade into clear at the bottom.  Now, tell me this, Roland.  Is some of this based in jealousy because he gets to hang out with Blake Shelton in the studio?  No.  I mean, if you want to know what Mike Piff looks like, walk around Chelsea, bump to the person.  That's what he looks like.  Oh, my God.  If you were nicer, you'd be in there with Blake Shelton and Piff.  Is that true?  What?  Oh, sorry.  Eric said if you were nicer, you'd be in there with Blake Shelton and Piff.  It doesn't matter.  I could go in with one of the other ones.  I went above his head.  He's just going to walk into other interviews. 
[00:10:00]  Technically, I mean, you're with talent, so you probably could just walk into Piff's interview and stand in there.  And if he goes, go away, I just go like this.  Shh.  Yeah, shh.  Pat him on the head a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Ask another question there.  Oh, my God.  When is your – so I see you've got a couple markers.  I'm ready.  You have a photo folder.  I learned right there from Iraq.  I took all the notes.  Yeah.  Everything.  I absorbed it.  You got the camera.  And then I'm executing it.  When is the execution taking place?  And by execution, I don't mean – listen.  If Blake Shelton or his people are listening, I'm not saying that Roland is literally going to execute anybody. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  I love Blake Shelton.  I'm saying when is this going to go down the –  probably after I get Chris Evans to do the liners, I'm going to go meet up with the Blake Shelton, get my picture, and get my picture signed.  So what time is that, are we thinking?  Probably close to 11.  Okay, so towards the end of the show.  So we'll kind of keep updating on your status as the show goes on.  Eric, we should do some kind of content.  Why don't we –  Line of the day. 
[00:11:00]  I know.  Why are you going to start now?  No, I know.  You're right.  Well, we started yesterday, and he threw me off because I wasn't prepared.  What, you mean playing a bit, you mean?  Yeah.  Well, I mean –  Usually it's just, all right, Sam's on here.  I turn my mic off and just sit back.  Well, I would like to interact with you a little bit.  I like you.  Okay.  Here is – how many runners-up do we have today?  We want to do Line of the Day.  We have two runners-up.  Okay, yeah, let's do Line of the Day.  We missed it on Opie and Anthony today because we ran out of time.  There was too much content.  The Captain America interview went too well. 
[00:11:30]  By the way, Roland, did you stay away from the donuts?  I did.  I just sniffed it again.  Congratulations.  So far.  I mean, you know, who knows what the day will –  They're still out there.  Yeah.  No, my fat ass doesn't need one.  Trust me.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Here is the first runner-up Line of the Day.  And I am voting go fuck your mother on this fucking stadium.  And on the new arena and the Islanders and this minor league softball team.  You can't do that.  Whatever the fuck they are.  We have a voice.  We can get a lot of people to vote yes.  Yeah, I got a voice. 
[00:12:00]  John Ching.  Pull that lever for fuck you.  I don't want to say this.  I like that.  That was Ant talking about property tax in Long Island and how he – they're asking,  they're voting to see if the community wants to pay for the Islanders' new stadium and all that.  They're awful, the team.  Who, the Islanders?  You're not a fan?  Not at all.  You think they stink?  They think worse than my sweaty ball sack right now.  And that stinks terrible?  Come over here.  No, I won't.  I won't.  Here's the runner-up Line of the Day. 
[00:12:30]  You have no idea.  I saw him tweet something about that.  He has?  Right.  And do the puppet master.  What am I missing?  You're missing a lot.  Compassion.  Right.  Sobriety.  That was Jim's credit, right, Eric?  It's both.  Because Ant really left himself open for that.  But Ant did something very smart.  You leave yourself open like that, but then you do a little self-deprecating. 
[00:13:00]  And it brings it all back around and leaves a smile on everybody's face.  Ladies and gentlemen.  And Eric, are we back to playing the old sweeper or are you still going to play the new one?  No, I think we'll just stick with the current one.  Which is the new one?  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Well, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  Today's Line of the Day.  Here comes something funny that was said on the show today because we're here and live  and on a vacation. 
[00:13:30]  Sue and the company.  I'm so glad, I got a face, I got a face, I got a face.  I'm so glad, I got a face.  Why do the police don't squirt it with mace?  Why do people yell things about my race?  I don't know what we're getting in race, human race.  Ah!  What was the scream from?  That was Jim with, what's his name?  Uriah Faber.  Oh, Uriah Faber doing The Game Maker. 
[00:14:00]  That video is up on Obi's YouTube, Obi Radio.  Yeah, that was a very funny line.  Definitely got Line of the Day.  That is some quick thinking.  Today, Eric and I have seen Harry Potter.  Is that true?  Yes.  Special screening.  Oh.  And Senor Opie is coming too.  He is.  No Aunt Jim?  I guess Aunt's all the way out in Long Island.  Yeah, Jim has something to do.  Roland was down on the red carpet screaming for when all the stars were coming in.  Is that true, Roland?  We don't discuss that live on the air. 
[00:14:30]  And Roland, we found out something very interesting about you on the show today.  Yes.  You almost were added to the sex offenders list?  No.  Yesterday, in the park?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the one that...  You were like, for a second, you were like, no, for the love of God, no.  And I was like, I don't know, the one woman that knows Opie's son, and I walked by, I  went, because I walked by Hudson, or inside, I go, and he turns around and goes back.  So, I did that to him.  She didn't, I didn't realize, I didn't say hello to Opie first. 
[00:15:00]  She went, over here.  No, because she sees you just talking to the kid, and so she starts trying to grab the kid  away from you.  I went, hello.  Yeah.  Everybody thinks you're...  But Opie was smart.  He took, like, a few minutes, and then he goes, he's with me.  But he lets you hang out there for a few minutes.  Yeah, because they're all just staring and holding their children, like...  Do you think you give off the impression of somebody who's not to be trusted around children  alone?  I will say this.  I walked from Sirius home, then I stopped to get a juice, then Opie texted me, me, me 
[00:15:30]  here, and I walked there.  I was drinking sweat.  I had water coming out, and I'm, like, trying to give more thirst than none.  Licking your lips?  It was awful.  Then I could realize what I was doing, and then they're like, help!  Your hair was all matted down from the sweat and everything.  And then I had, like, wet spots all over me, and I'm just, like, walking around, like,  where's Opie?  Sticking your tongue out at the little kids.  Yeah.  The little one-and-a-half-year-old.  It wasn't the best choice.  Well, we were talking to Opie and Anthony, well, we were. 
[00:16:00]  They were talking to each other about taxes a lot this morning.  That was the first break of the show.  Brilliant radio, if you didn't hear it.  Listen at 3 p.m. Eastern.  That's when the replay starts.  But Opie was, you know, like we said, it refers directly to the line of the day, talking  about the Islanders and everything.  Where are you going, Roland?  Um, see, grab Chris Evans for liners.  Okay.  Then Blake Shelton.  Check back in with us, okay?  I will.  I want updates.  Uh, so they were talking about taxes and the Islanders and everything, and, uh, we were 
[00:16:30]  also talking about, uh, the amount of money that Christian Lopez, the guy who caught the  Derek Jeter ball, is going to have to pay in taxes for, uh, for the stuff that the Yankees  gave him.  Um, so I talked to Opie in the hallway right after that.  Opie, while that whole thing about taxes was going on, Anthony brought up not paying  the tax to help the Islanders get a new stadium.  Are you concerned? 
[00:17:00]  Uh, am I concerned?  Why would I be concerned?  You're an Islanders fan.  You go to, you have season tickets.  You go to games all the time.  Well, I'm concerned because I don't want to sit in those shitty plastic seats anymore,  and I'm hoping that Ant does the right thing and votes yes on the new stadium and the new  arena.  While we're talking about seating, this is even more important.  Bobo offered you a ticket to the Mets game on Saturday.  Will you be willing to pay the taxes on the gift of the ticket from Bobo? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know if I'm going to the game with Bobo yet.  What?  You think I'm going to the game with Bobo?  I thought it was understood that you and Bobo were checking out the Mets game on Saturday.  No, I might have to be in Philly for a graduation party.  It's convenient.  Yeah, it is convenient.  Because I love going to Philly for family functions.  You didn't know that?  No, and I didn't know who was graduating in July.  Uh, they already graduated from high school a month ago, and now they're having the graduation  party.  Why has it become this big, huge thing? 
[00:18:00]  Because it means so much to him, and he's emailing and calling all of us, by the way,  asking when he can ask you, when he can drop off the tickets.  The only reason I would go is to get some video out of it.  Yeah.  But I don't even know if it's worth doing that.  So it could be a maybe no-go for Bobo.  At this point, I wouldn't bet on it.  Anything to say to Bobo?  Or leave me alone, creep?  And it's not going to sit well?  Kenny's down the hall.  He's ready to pounce. 
[00:18:30]  Eric, I think after hearing that, your prediction about Opie not going may be coming true.  Wow, you're such a dick.  Why?  Why do you say that?  I was laughing at him because of all the things.  He's like, well, is he going to pay the fucking taxes on Bobo's gift?  Well, I wanted to know because apparently, because that's what I learned on the show today,  that if you give a gift, you got to pay taxes.  So I wanted to know if Bobo gives him the gift of the ticket, would Opie be willing to  pay the taxes on it?  By the way, when you're talking about Roland going into that park where he might be misconstrued 
[00:19:00]  as a child molester, the outfit and everything looks like this Looney Tunes character I put  up on the TV there.  He was wearing purple?  No, no.  But I'm just saying, see the way the shirt bulges around him and the face?  And the shoulders up and everything.  The face just kind of sinks into the body.  The Shropshire Slasher?  That's what Roland looks like.  Oh my gosh.  Yeah, I guess with the arms hanging down like that, I guess I wouldn't trust Roland in a 
[00:19:30]  park full of kids either, especially on a playground.  You'd think he'd have no business there.  Well, you know, this was also, didn't he, I think I heard this when I was walking along,  did he say he blacked out and woke up in Central Park?  Yeah.  I guess we're going to talk about blackouts on the show tomorrow.  At the very end of the show today, we were talking about that.  And Roland did say that, I mean, Roland, we talked to him yesterday about drinking.  He loves to drink.  He loves liquor.  And he did say at the end of the show today that he woke up in Central Park twice, he's 
[00:20:00]  done it, without knowing at all how he got there.  So maybe that's why he was being looked at.  Maybe a lot of those mothers recognized him.  Oh, like one day he'd woken up on the playground or something.  Yeah, they're walking their child early in the morning through the park and they're  Roland.  They figured, well, he could pass as a homeless guy, I think.  He's too well fed.  Oh, Eric.  You love that there's somebody you can make fun of for that.  Well, the other one's gone.  Oh, is that, I know, I think I know who you're talking about, the Danny Bonaducey producer?  Yes.  Oh, Eric.  Listen, we talked on the phone today, we were talking about Christian Lopez just now, and 
[00:20:30]  we talked on the phone today, we talked to his mother.  Christian Lopez is the guy who caught the Derek Jeter ball, the 3,000th hit, the home run,  and he ended up giving it back to Derek Jeter.  He didn't get any money for it or anything.  Do you think, by the way, sorry, Eric, you don't think Bo was going to get to go to this  wedding with, I mean, this wedding, this Mets game with Opie, do you?  It sounds, to me.  I'm going to hold out.  Yeah.  And I'm going to go with Hope on this one. 
[00:21:00]  But then the sign over there says, don't go home with Hope, so I'm torn.  Who's in there with you?  It's Troy answering and yelling at the callers.  Oh, he's still screening calls?  Well, he was doing other stuff and decided to pick up the phone, but one of these days  I've got to turn the mic on during the ONA show, when Troy's just screaming at people.  Just record him, and we'll play it on this show if you want to.  Yeah, just record him on a little recorder.  What does Troy think Bobo's chances are of getting to go to this Mets game?  Because I think at this point, today is the last day we even need to talk about it. 
[00:21:30]  Because, to me, the answer that Opie just gave makes it really doubtful.  Hey, Troy, do you think Bobo's going to get to go to the Mets game with Hope?  No, it's going to happen what we said was going to happen.  He's not going to go.  Yeah, I mean, did you hear the answer he just gave me when I asked him?  He's already, like, now saying, because I said, you know, when you get the Mets ticket  from Bobo, are you going to be willing to pay the tax on it?  And he said, who said I'm going to the Mets game with Bobo?  So right there, you go, oh. 
[00:22:00]  Exactly.  I guess you're probably going to end up not going.  That's going to hurt Bobo's feelings.  It is.  Maybe you could put a substitute in, though.  You?  No, I don't want to go, but find somebody else that will go.  And you're, wait, well, I didn't catch your reason that you can't go?  This Saturday?  Yeah, was it that you can't or you just don't want to?  No, this Saturday, my band, I Want to Kill You, is playing with Burnt by the Sun  at Club Reverb in Redding, Pennsylvania.  Blake Shelton!  And that was Roland just yelling Blake Shelton.  I guess that was our Blake Shelton update that we were waiting for on Roland.  Obviously, he has yet to get a picture and autograph from his hero, Blake Shelton, because if he 
[00:22:30]  had, he'd be in here gloating about it already.  We were talking just a minute ago about the guy who caught the Derek Jeter ball, the 3,000th  ball.  His mother was on the phone with us, who, by the way, did seem to be more in her senses  than when we talked to Bobo's mother.  So there's the connection with that.  She was on the phone, and it was a great phone call.  We got some jokes out about the young man's weight, because he is on the heavy side.  But it didn't get too cringy. 
[00:23:00]  That's something you can never be sure of on this show, because lots of times we get  the people who are in the paper on the phone.  We have, you know, ways of finding people's phone numbers, and when they're in the newspaper,  a story we want to talk about, we'll get them on the phone.  That's what we do as a radio show.  It's something that we do to entertain all of you people.  So, with that said, you never know exactly how it's going to go, especially because these  people who are in the news don't have publicists that we have to worry about.  We can just completely mess with them without any repercussions, theoretically speaking. 
[00:23:30]  So, when the mother called, I didn't know, and I'm sure most of you didn't know, how  it was going to go.  It went well, but we have plenty examples of that not going well.  For instance, there was a news story about a man who had worked at McDonald's for 50 years.  Eric, do you remember this guy's name by chance?  His name was Leonard.  Leonard, of course.  Leonard, the guy who spent 50 years of his life working at McDonald's. 
[00:24:00]  He never wanted to work anywhere else.  He never wanted a promotion.  He wasn't a manager.  Wasn't he just the guy who swept up or something?  Yeah, go with janitor.  I think that's what he was.  Yeah, he just swept up the floor.  He never wanted anything else, and he was happy where he was.  So, we did manage to get that.  We found the McDonald's.  We called up the McDonald's, and of course, Leonard was on duty, so we got Leonard on the phone.  This is dating back to 2009.  It's about two years ago. 
[00:24:30]  But we talked to his manager, I believe, at first, or one of his co-workers.  We talked to the manager first, and then they put Leonard on the phone.  Okay, so we're starting here with the manager.  Yeah, it all blends right in.  Okay, and if you want a cringe-inducing phone call, this is it.  It's Leonard, the McDonald's, not a 50-year-old employee, a man who's been an employee of McDonald's for 50 years.  Much worse.  It's Leonard on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:25:00]  Hi, is the manager there?  I'm a manager.  What?  Susan, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're very excited about Leonard and his 50 years of service, and we figured we would talk about him today.  Okay.  Now, he's been there 50 years.  How long have you been working as his boss?  22 years.  22 years.  So about half of his tenure there has been under your leadership.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  So you've been covering for his mistakes for the last 22 years? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Now, did you have anything to do with the planning of this party that made the news?  No, our owner did it.  Oh, the owner did it.  Oh, are you a little taken aback by the fact that he's been there 50 years and really didn't get that much?  I'm sorry.  My phone was beeping in when you were talking.  All right.  Well, do you think he didn't get that much for having been there 50 years? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, he gets a lot.  And Susan?  Is your name Susan?  The question, I'm trying to put this delicately.  We saw the story and we were touched by it.  And we wanted to know if Leonard is...  You can't say the same stuff you can say in 1940, which is, you know, rhymes with e-arted.  But is he a little slow or a little bit learning, kind of disabled or anything like that?  Um, no, but as you get a little old, you get a little handicapped, you can't quite keep up. 
[00:26:30]  So, but what about the 30 years before?  Or is it the mop?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  Like the 30 years before, like he's 68 now.  How about when he was, uh, say 22 years ago when he was what, 40?  45.  45?  45?  Yeah.  He was pretty good.  Is his mind really sharp?  Yes.  Hmm.  Wow.  Am I wrong on this?  I think he's a shrewd guy.  I just think...  Yeah.  We want to know why he never, why he never ascended to your level.  We want to know why he never got a real job. 
[00:27:00]  A real job?  This is a real job.  Well, maybe a promotion.  No, to your level.  Why didn't he, isn't he at least your same, like why wouldn't he go to management?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  He didn't want to.  He didn't want to.  He was the maintenance man originally.  Maintenance man?  Wow.  And now, and now he's like a bus boy?  He can't, now he can't lift and do the trash and do the maintenance, so now he's the lobby man.  Okay.  And what is that, what is he, what is his actual duties?  What does he have to do?  He cleans the dining room, talks to the customers. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Fills lids, straws, napkins, fakes out.  Now, do you worry about him doing things to the burgers?  No, he don't go back with the burgers.  Oh, he don't, you don't let him fuck with the food?  No, no, no.  He does the clean up.  Oh, Susan.  I don't let him touch the food.  We really want to know why he's just the clean up guy.  I mean, you gotta let us in on this.  There's a story behind this that isn't coming out.  Why is he still just the clean up guy?  That's what he can do. 
[00:28:00]  Does he get, oh boy, they're not fessing up.  Does he get touchy-feely with the rest of the employees?  Any, any human resources problems?  Oh, shit.  Is he trying to?  Susan's funny.  She, she, she, she can't, she can't tell.  What is he, is he trying to spread his, his old special sauce?  He's back to him fucking the burgers.  No.  Susan, you, Susan's hilarious.  Yeah, I like Susan.  Oh my God, man.  I like Susan a lot.  Susan, well, good old Leonard. 
[00:28:30]  Susan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, can we talk to Leonard again?  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Put Leonard on a little more.  I believe you're a corporate McDonald's guy and you're in the fire room, please.  Shh, shh, shh.  Can you do that?  Yeah.  Hello, Leonard.  Yeah, this is me again.  Hi, this is Bill Zamwick with McDonald's Corporation.  How are you?  This is who?  Bill Zamwick.  Yes.  I'm with the McDonald's Corporation.  Oh, yes.  And you put in 50 years of service with us, I recently learned. 
[00:29:00]  And I just want to let you know, something has come up.  You know, we have been in a recession.  You do understand this.  Have been what?  In a recession.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, you've heard about that.  Leonard, I'm very sorry.  We're going to have to let you go.  Okay.  We're going to have to let you go.  I'm heartbroken about this. 
[00:29:30]  The McDonald's Corporation recognizes your years of diligent service with the company,  but you're going to have to clean out your stuff, and we'll let you finish out the week,  but on Friday, I'm really sorry.  You're being terminated.  Okay.  Who are you going to replace me with?  Well, we're doing away with the position.  It is useless.  It's been deemed redundant. 
[00:30:00]  There's other people that can do that.  I really do apologize for this.  I'm sorry.  I'm terribly sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, why don't you just, you know something, just pack up now and take off.  Okay.  Yeah, because it's pretty much over.  Oh, shit, dude.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No, fuck him. 
[00:30:30]  We don't have to call no one back.  Oh, he hung up.  By the way, that wasn't open.  No, that wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  It's all right.  What's he going to do, walk in front of a bus?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Crikey.  Crikey.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  After ONA Live.  And the funny thing about the whole thing is, after that bit, he did go walk in front of a bus.  The end.  Yeah, the end.  That's the way the whole thing ended. 
[00:31:00]  It's after Opie and Anthony Live, of course.  That was our old pal, Leonard, who spent 50 years working at McDonald's.  And they gave him the day off.  Yeah, and then we tricked him.  Yeah, that's right.  That was the big prize.  They gave him some kind of watch and the day off.  It was a Happy Meal watch and one day off for his services working at that McDonald's.  Obviously, he ended up fine, and I'm pretty sure he's probably still working.  Dead now?  Oh.  Okay.  You were going to – which one were you going to go with that?  I was assuming dead now, but that's just speculation. 
[00:31:30]  Okay, so we'll go with – I'll say this, because I don't know for a fact.  He's either still working at McDonald's or dead.  Either one is just as likely at this point because –  In the ball pit.  Yeah, and you think he would be buried in a ball pit.  He was cleaning it out, looking for change, and died in the ball pit.  And nobody – everybody just left him.  He just sank to the bottom.  Let him decompose in there.  Who cares?  It's Leonard.  What has he got going on?  What about this – Eric, you were telling me while the bit was playing that you were  listening to Mars when he was sitting here by himself. 
[00:32:00]  Mars is our engineer here at the Opie and Anthony show.  Let me see if I can find it before I say what happened.  You were recording him.  No, no, no, no.  I want to get him in here to ask him.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  I thought you said let me see if I can find it because I guess he was sitting in here  before we went on with Opie and Anthony live, and E-Rock said that even though Mars was  in here by himself, there were very strange noises coming out of the studio.  I heard the phone.  I liked the E-Rock. 
[00:32:30]  I told E-Rock, Troy.  I don't know if you know this or not, but I told E-Rock to leave the phone – just throw  the mic on whenever the office phone rings and pick it up saying, hey, it's E-Rock,  you're on the air.  Whenever the office phone rings in that office, just throw the mic on, and then that way we  can all hear the phone call.  I mean, the conversations usually aren't that exciting.  I was calling engineering.  I didn't want to put them on.  Well, that's fair.  But it's still something – you know, we all like to share.  Like, is a vacuum cleaner exciting?  No, but it was that day.  It was one of the best shows we've ever done.  I laughed my fucking ass off. 
[00:33:00]  Mars, you know that E-Rock eavesdrops when – even when the mics are off, right?  I know that –  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's my fault.  Go ahead.  I know that E-Rock probably eavesdrops 24-7 on anybody, anything.  Eavesdrops?  The fucking National Enquirer is over there, so I wouldn't be surprised if I was recorded  doing anything or saying anything during the morning.  I don't have any recordings of you.  I see you looking around.  I don't even know what's going on.  He said – Eric, I came in here to do the show, and while the bit was playing, Eric 
[00:33:30]  said, man, I've got to tell you, Mars was in here before you got in.  He was sitting on the couch by himself, and all I heard was this loud grunting coming  from the couch.  What was going on, Eric?  I was switching everything over while the commercials were going for the 10 o'clock  show, and I'm hearing this noise.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  And I pick up the headphones, and Mars is sitting on the couch over there, and he's  just going – like, he's just making all these primal noises. 
[00:34:00]  I'm like, what the fuck are you making primal noises?  I know what you're talking about.  I was reading certain emails from certain women.  Those were angry noises you were making.  They were just inquiring noises, like, what the fuck are they thinking?  You know, what's going on?  So the emails, you were – work-related.  Work-related.  Absolutely work-related.  You were reading some –  Some people that are, like, you know, listening to us right now probably can figure out what  I'm talking about.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they know in correlation to, oh, that's weird. 
[00:34:30]  I just sent Mars an email to me right around 10 o'clock.  Exactly.  Eastern time.  And so you were audibly reacting to those emails.  That's what I was doing, Eric.  Okay.  That's pretty funny.  No, if I heard all this noise, I put the headphones on, and you're just grunting.  It is funny, though.  Whatever the email said – and you can share if you want.  This is a safe place.  Well, I'd rather just keep this one under my head.  That's fine, too, if you don't want to share what's in your personal or work email.  Oh, absolute work.  Work email.  It has nothing to do with my private life. 
[00:35:00]  See, everything to do with fucking work, and motherfuckers have the authority to either  tell me what to do, or think they can tell me what to do.  You don't like that.  Or give me options, or just ask questions that are like –  You should know this.  So you're really –  Yes.  People were being cute.  You're really narrowing down.  Like, now it's like, okay, I sent Mars an email.  It was telling him what to do.  It was giving him options.  He's definitely talking about me.  And I like that you say that it's safe to come in here. 
[00:35:30]  As if we were to come in here and talk about whatever has happened.  It's a safe place.  And everything's going to be okay as soon as we leave this studio.  It is.  This is like a safe place.  It's like – I think of the after Opie and Anthony live studio like a therapist's office.  Everything is open.  Everything is honest.  It's safe.  Nothing will be held against you.  Not – I won't hold it against you.  But outside these doors.  I mean, that's out of my control.  I mean, that's not what I was talking about.  That's totally –  But I would think that the people outside these doors would respect that I've made this, at least for this hour – I can't speak for Opie and Anthony – but at least for this hour, I've made this a safe place. 
[00:36:00]  And I would hope that they would respect that wherever – whoever you're talking about.  I don't know if it's down the hall or not.  Could be.  Could be.  Could be.  It doesn't – who knows?  But your rule, such as it stands –  Safe place, you mean?  Yeah.  Right.  That shit ain't working outside these doors.  It doesn't.  I've seen people leave this fucking studio saying what they feel, saying what they think it's the proper thing because it's the truth. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Leave here and be scolded.  Who are you talking about?  I'm not talking about anybody in particular.  I didn't know if you were talking about me or not.  But they get scolded.  They get told that maybe we should go another direction when we're having that topic.  Oh.  Okay.  Who said that?  I'm not saying that.  That's Troy asking that question.  No, I'd like to know.  Mars looks angry.  Look at his eyes.  We're wide open.  He gets furious.  He was upset by the email that was sent to him.  What was the email?  Can I read it?  I'll read it.  Let me read it.  I'll read it. 
[00:37:00]  No, no.  It's not even the wording of the email.  It's just passive-aggressive bullshit?  Is that what you're saying?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  And does that email kind of add up to a whole bunch of things that's just like, again with  this shit?  Exactly.  Kind of like that?  And that's what that grunt translates to.  Right.  Again with this motherfucker.  And it's sort of like that.  This fucking asshole.  Again with this fucking asshole.  Right?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, you can say that.  For the record.  And Mars, you can back us up. 
[00:37:30]  For the record, just to clear ourselves, Troy and me honestly have no idea who the email  is from.  Right.  And it could be from various people, not just from one person.  It could be from people we don't know.  It could be in your department, people we never met.  Right.  Or it could be our department.  Who knows?  And it could also be an email that I saw afterwards where other jackasses.  People were CC'd.  They were CC'd.  And they made reference to it.  So you just add them on to the list.  It's like, you're dummy.  You're dummy.  And you scroll down and see what the original thing was. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  And the different questions that are being asked.  I'm like, okay, how long have you been in the business?  Right.  All right.  You know?  Okay.  Things like that.  So even the original, the person who sent it to you just now, maybe he's not the one  you were grunting at.  Exactly.  Who or she.  Or a lot of people, what you might be saying is they're pussies and they hide behind emails  instead of just confronting you face to face like a man.  Is that what you're saying?  No, no.  That's not what this has nothing to do with it.  Oh, I was just, okay.  It's more like the guys of work.  You know?  It's just like. 
[00:38:30]  Let me read it.  I'll be the judge of this.  We'll leave that one off.  And to everybody who says, I'm a shit stirrer.  Yeah.  He picked up very well.  He picked up very well.  Let me tell you something about this gentleman right here.  You're talking about Troy?  Troy.  When he used to.  He's the phone screener, you know.  For O&M.  Very quickly.  As quickly as I can do this.  Sure, sure.  When he first came over to 56th, 57th Street, right?  Before we were in this building.  Right.  To shadow someone that used to work with us.  You're talking about Butcher?  Butcher.  We'll call him Butcher.  Okay.  Butcher. 
[00:39:00]  And he used to come in every morning.  He was very polite, very cordial.  Right?  Cordial.  Cordial.  There you go.  And just a pleasant individual.  You know?  At first, we were like taken aback.  Like, should we really trust this guy?  Because he's new.  We didn't trust him at first.  But after a while.  And I mean, Butcher was screening calls then, right?  Right.  That was a mistake Butcher made.  But go on.  Anyway.  So after a while, we noticed that he, Troy's cool, man.  He's like, you know, he's a real dude.  You know?  He's like, he's a cool guy.  Sure.  Nice person.  You say good morning to him.  He was unlike the rest of the ONA staff. 
[00:39:30]  He would actually say good morning, be very polite, very pleasant.  You know?  Sure.  All of us in the ONA staff have that courtesy, you know?  We've hardened over the years.  Exactly.  So there goes my point.  Straight to that.  What is it?  Two years now?  About two and a half years.  This motherfucker has grown so callous.  Just degenerated.  What?  Just completely hardened.  Dude, let me tell you.  He's every day.  He's ready.  He's like jacked.  Ready.  I mean, just the other day, yesterday, you told me, I wish so-and-so would say something 
[00:40:00]  about me, so I could run in there, and so-and-so did say something about him, and he ran in  here, but he had to back up, because it was like a pleasant thing.  It was like a bad thing.  Well, you know that you have to store ammunition on everybody.  You said something about him yesterday.  But, you know, but basically, whatever.  Basically, people take, they mistake kindness for weakness, and I found that out really quick.  So then you just have to go, all right, motherfucker, slit your throat.  Okay.  And then you have to store ammunition on every single person, and be ready to slit people's 
[00:40:30]  throats at the drop of a hat.  So now, I used to get the, good morning, Troy.  Good morning.  I used to get that.  Now you say, good morning.  He fucking, like, one eyebrow shoots up, and he's like, like, why?  You know what I mean?  What's your intention?  Plus, he's listening carefully so he can get the sex buzzer on at the right time.  Am I right, Troy?  Amen.  Listen, we got to get Ron and Fez on.  Not necessary.  What?  Ron and Fez?  Of course they're necessary.  They're a huge show.  You know what, Eric? 
[00:41:00]  No matter what you say, to me, Ron and Fez are necessary, and to many of the fans, they  are, too.  They're coming up next.  Open Anthony and after Open Anthony Live continue tomorrow.  Have a great day, and stay tuned for Ron and Fez. </pre>
