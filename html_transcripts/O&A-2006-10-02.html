<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, labeling themselves as "a bunch of dopes," "lewd," and "retards," anticipating potential arrests. They briefly lamented the New York Jets' performance before launching into a lengthy discussion about the upcoming baseball playoffs and the Yankees, heavily criticizing the team's management and older players, speculating about steroid use.  Their outlook on the Yankees' chances was pessimistic.

Opie then recounted his experience at a Saturday Night Live taping, including meeting cast members and Lorne Michaels.  However, the majority of the segment focused on his unexpected encounter with Ron Howard at a Starbucks.  Opie detailed his initial surprise, his failed first attempt to approach Howard, his subsequent frantic search, and the eventual conversation, highlighting their shared name "Opie" and Howard's awareness of and humor regarding the radio show's controversies. Opie secured a photo with Howard and his wife, even briefly discussing his unsuccessful attempt to join a co-op board. He ranked this encounter as his second-best celebrity sighting after Bill Clinton, a topic further explored with listener calls.

The show included a segment on their "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, featuring a 430-pound contestant and their ongoing search for heavier participants.  They highlighted YouTube videos related to the contest, including footage of an intern, Craig, sucking on a contestant's hernia.  This transitioned into a discussion of videos showcasing failed magician tricks, particularly focusing on a disastrous Harry Blackstone Jr. halftime show from 1987.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Congressman Mark Foley's resignation following the revelation of sexually explicit messages sent to underage male pages.  The hosts and callers read excerpts from these messages, emphasizing Foley's attempts at seduction, his spelling errors, and the pages' responses.  The conversation was punctuated with laughter and humorous commentary, including speculation about Foley's internet habits and the creation of humorous nicknames. The hosts highlighted the irony of Foley's position as co-chair of the Missing and Exploited Children Caucus. A caller, claiming to be a former page, alleged that Foley's behavior wasn't unusual, describing other instances of inappropriate conduct by members of Congress.  This segment also included a discussion of their "Line of the Month" contest, featuring lines from past broadcasts, including one involving Big Rhonda, a large female guest; reviews of movies including Stephen Lynch's "Wedding Singer," "Jackass Number Two," "Snakes on a Plane," and "The Grudge"; and information about Magic Shaving Powder.  The segment concluded with a MacBook giveaway and continued discussion of the Foley scandal.  Guitarist Gary Hoey was mentioned in relation to a "Line of the Month" entry.

Amber Tamblyn, actress in *The Grudge 2*, was a guest during a segment largely focusing on horror movies, specifically *The Grudge*.  The hosts and Tamblyn discussed filming techniques, the use of practical effects, and the contortionist actress portraying the ghost.  The conversation expanded to other horror films like *The Exorcist*, *The Shining*, and *Rosemary's Baby*, focusing on what made them frightening.  Jimmy Norton's inability to remember where he'd previously met Tamblyn was a recurring humorous element.  Listener calls contributed to the discussion. This segment transitioned to unrelated topics: a radio contest with a winning entry; news of a convicted child killer receiving a face tattoo; off-air comments; a mention of Club Soda Kenny's planned tour; and a discussion of music preferences, particularly criticizing the band Boston.

A segment featured a discussion of Jimmy Norton's eclectic music taste, revealed through Opie and Anthony’s "hacking" of his iPod.  The hosts and callers made homophobic remarks about his music choices, which included artists like Megadeth, The Beatles,  Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Bangles, Andrew W.K., and Black Sabbath. Jimmy discussed his favorite drummers, including Mickey Dee and Neil Peart. Club Soda Kenny, the show's security/roadie, participated in the banter. A listener's anecdote about Kenny in a hotel elevator was shared.  The segment also included a "dump report" detailing cut segments, mostly on Congressman Foley and his explicit internet chats; a pre-recorded, vulgar message from R. Lee Ermey; a call from Mr. T discussing his past, faith, and catchphrase; a story about a pregnant teenager and turpentine; a discussion of alligator heads and Croc shoes (including a story about a child’s foot injury); and a call from Suzanne, detailing her experiences in London's "grope rooms," leading to further explicit conversations. The segment concluded with promotion of the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest and discussion of a Tippi Tom album.

The final segment involved graphic discussions of suicide and suicide methods, prompted by the death of Spalding Gray.  The hosts and callers shared gruesome details of suicides, including descriptions of injuries and remains.  The conversation touched upon the suicides of Charlie Rocket and Ray Combs, and a bizarre workplace accident. R. Bud Dwyer's suicide was also mentioned. Callers shared additional anecdotes, including a suicide involving a wood chipper and details of the Altamont Speedway concert, focusing on the stabbing death of Meredith Hunter and the Hells Angels' involvement.  A caller recounted seeing two midgets in a bar, which led to fantastical and sexually explicit descriptions involving a primordial dwarf.  The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day," plugs for Mark Foley's website, Jerry Springer's participation in *Dancing with the Stars*, and a listener's restaurant, F.H. Riley's.  A caller from Russia provided a final anecdote before the show ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. 
[00:00:30]  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead!  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  We have a little bit of a show on the road.  F-ing Jets. 
[00:01:30]  F-ing Jets.  Aww.  Anyone see the end of that game?  No.  See the highlights, anything?  An amazing, amazing game.  We almost beat the Colts.  Ah! 
[00:02:00]  Game drove me nuts.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Welcome.  It's Monday morning.  Lots to do.  Just look at the back of the paper.  Like the Yankees, the playoffs are starting?  No, the last game is what?  Today?  Yesterday?  Oh, sure.  Wow, you are completely out of the loop this year.  You don't care.  No.  No.  Nope, not at all.  Big Yankee fan, but you just don't care this year. 
[00:02:30]  They're talking Subway Series.  Yankees, Mets.  Oh, cool.  That's what they're talking.  Good luck, Tigers.  He doesn't care.  Go Tigers.  That's Jimmy's mantra.  Go Tigers.  Jimmy had a little problem.  When did the playoffs start?  Like tomorrow?  Yeah.  I think it's tomorrow, right?  I just saw it.  It's in the back.  It's got a picture of one of the Mets in some chick in a Yankee uniform.  It says bring him on.  So Yanks take on Tigers and Mets battle Dodgers. 
[00:03:00]  Jimmy holds a grudge like no one.  Yep.  Like no one.  We lost Pedro for the playoffs.  Wow, what happened?  He's injured, man.  He's hurt himself.  And they're saying Randy Johnson's got a herniated disc.  What else?  Of course he does.  He's always hurt.  Good.  That's what happens to guys in their 50s.  Exactly.  They get herniated discs.  It doesn't matter.  Wasn't Fred McMurray available to pitch?  Schmucks.  Never wanted Randy Johnson.  He's never won anything in his life.  And they got him. 
[00:03:30]  And he has a bad back.  And there's always a problem with him.  And they had to pay him all that money.  But you don't care about baseball anymore.  No, not at all.  No.  I hope he's hurt.  Remember, Jimmy doesn't care about baseball anymore.  I hope he's just hurt for the playoffs and then he's fine.  I mean, I don't want to see his life ruin.  But I do want to see stupid George sitting there not knowing what he's doing and not knowing  how to run a team.  And he should just get out of baseball and let Gene Michael do it again.  And that's not.  Pending all that money on old guys.  Older people.  Yeah.  On older gentlemen.  Maybe Pete Rose can come in and pinch hit a rusty stob.  Stupid. 
[00:04:00]  Rusty stob.  Maybe George just likes the conversation in the office with the old guys that can talk  about things.  You know, he doesn't know what the kids are talking about these days.  So he just hires the older guys.  That's something in common.  A-Rod.  Why?  I don't want an all-star team that's just built by buying it.  I mean, I'm not a purist, but it's just annoying.  But you don't care about baseball.  Not at all.  Good luck, Mets.  Go Mets.  Mets Tigers.  That's the series I want to see.  Let's go, Mets.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Meet the Mets. 
[00:04:30]  Greet the Mets.  Step right up and meet the Mets.  Exactly.  Or if you're Mabel King, lift up your leg and wave your useless feet to the Mets.  I don't think they really rhyme, but I have to get a Mabel King joke in there Monday morning  first thing.  Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one.  That's a good slogan.  As sung by Harry Chapin.  I don't even know if he was drunk when he had his accent, but car crash, alcohol, always  funny.  What a great beer commercial.  You're basically telling people to get hammered on Schaefer. 
[00:05:00]  It's the beer to have when you're having more than one.  And of course, it came out Roger Clemens, maybe steroids.  Here's the deal.  It's so simple.  They can discuss this on sports radio until they're blue in the face.  If you're in baseball and you're over the age of 35, most likely you did steroids.  Most likely you did steroids in Major League Baseball.  Can we stop?  Sometimes back in the day.  I'm speaking, I'm generalizing, because I'm sure there were goody two-shoes that didn't 
[00:05:30]  want to take the needle in the butt in the locker room.  They're the ones that are rats now.  But for the most part, if you're over 35 especially, you did steroids in Major League Baseball.  You just did.  It was what they were doing.  I don't know why we care.  Let them do it.  Well, they couldn't have done that back in the other day.  So what?  They didn't have orthoscopic surgery.  They didn't have a lot of things back in 1910.  So let's put an asterisk to every record, because they didn't have night games at a  certain time.  It was all day games.  Who cares? 
[00:06:00]  True.  No black people.  They said that even Andy Pettit most likely did steroids.  And he was a goody two-shoes when he was with the Yankees.  He was a great pitcher.  He was a great pitcher.  A religious man now.  It was the thing they were doing.  I would even have to go with like low 30s and over.  Have to.  I think they should be giving it to little leaguers.  Why not?  Why not?  Big pumped up sixth grader.  So they're macking the ball out of the park.  They're putting in their helmets by the time they're seniors in high school.  That would make the games more exciting. 
[00:06:30]  I know when in my high school, the football players were doing it.  When I was in high school.  It was the thing to do.  High school football players.  Absolutely.  I kind of do remember something about that.  They were doing it back then.  Back then, when men were oysters.  You hear?  I hear me.  Hey, I got to say hi to the gang at SNL.  Oh, now it's the gang at SNL.  The gang.  It's not just the cast or.  Including Mr. Michaels.  That would be Lorne to you. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Lorne Michaels?  Had a moment with Lorne Michaels at the after party.  I was lucky enough.  If you listen to the show Friday, we had Dane Cook on the phone.  And I just threw out there, hey, I could use a couple tickets to SNL.  Which is a really hard ticket to get.  And because Bob Kelly was doing tourgasm at the forgata.  He gave me his tickets.  And I got to go.  And it was great to be there.  First time I've ever seen a taping of Saturday Night Live.  Went to the after party. 
[00:07:30]  It was amazing.  I mean, like the taping going there, is it like, because I heard it kind of is a pain  in the ass if you're in the audience.  Is it?  No, we said up top, which is the place to be because you're out of the way of all the  boom, you know, the boom mics and the cameras on their thangs.  You know the audience what you see on TV, on the floor?  Yeah.  It's only like, I don't know, 30 people, tops.  And then everyone else sits up high.  We're like front row.  Kind of balcony.  And it's organized chaos is what it is. 
[00:08:00]  They're just, they're a well-oiled machine.  And there's one lady.  She's a little chubby, which surprises me because all the running around she does, she  should be a lot thinner.  That's a compliment.  I'm sure she'll love to hear.  As soon as the scene is over, her whole job is to grab the guest host, grab him by the  collar and pull him off stage to get him ready for the next skit.  That's her whole job.  So the skit will end and they'll go to commercial.  Within a half second of going to commercial, she's on stage, grabs Dane Cook, and just 
[00:08:30]  pulls him, yanks him off stage to get ready for the next one.  That's her whole job.  And she's been doing it for so long.  She knows exactly how much time she needs to get them dressed for the next bit.  You know, you got to wonder after so many years how they've been able to do it without  it really, without some major league hitches.  You know, they've had little things happen over the years, but there's been no like major  league glitch.  Yeah.  30 years.  That was funny.  Amy Poehler is, she is funny. 
[00:09:00]  We got to get her on the show.  I think Roland is trying to get her, but they're setting up for the first bit and she's on stage,  you know, dressed as a politician or whatever.  And they're getting ready for the first bit and they're going 30 seconds and everyone else  is calm.  And she's like, oh God, oh no.  She just starts losing it.  The crowd is losing their minds.  And then two seconds before they go live, she just completely gets into her all stops  and does her part perfectly.  But she just knows how to have fun with it, you know.  But it was a great time.  Then we went to the after party and got to meet Lauren Michaels. 
[00:09:30]  Who was the after party?  Who was the band?  The Killers.  Oh, nice.  The new CD by The Killers has got to be great.  Has to be.  I don't know what the reviews are, but the two songs they played on SNL were really,  really good.  Really good.  And then Barry Katz was there and I'm sitting right next to a table away from Lauren Michaels  and I go, Barry, I really want to meet Lauren Michaels, you know.  And I was giving up around three.  The after hour party goes from one to four.  And then there's an after after party that starts at four. 
[00:10:00]  Code word Horatio.  Is that what it was?  Code word Horatio.  Because I guess he started the after after party.  And I'm sitting there like, I can't believe this.  They've been doing this for 32 years, the after party.  And I'm at one.  It was really cool.  So we're finally ready to leave.  And Barry Katz, he sees me leaving.  He's a great guy, man.  Because I was giving up on meeting Lauren Michaels.  All of a sudden he grabs me, turns.  Lauren Michaels is holding court with like five cast members. 
[00:10:30]  And all of a sudden he just goes, hey, guys, this is Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  And they all turn around, half the cast knows the show.  And then Lauren Michaels stands up to shake my hand and says, it's a pleasure to meet you.  And we had a little chit-chat, a little chit-chat.  A little chit-chat.  A little chatter at the door.  And it was going really good, but I didn't want to like push it.  So I just like awkwardly, well, I got to go.  I don't want to bother you anymore.  And I turn around quickly.  And I got to go, I'm a busy man, Lauren.  And as I turned around, I hear, it was a pleasure meeting you, you know, in that Lauren  Michaels voice. 
[00:11:00]  And I'm just like, oh my God, did Lauren Michaels just say that?  It was really, really cool.  We had a good time.  And then yesterday, yesterday I had one of the biggest star sightings ever for me personally.  You know, I think Clinton is my biggest still.  But I think this might be my second biggest, my second biggest.  This could be.  And I don't think Jimmy's got one of these.  I told Jimmy.  Yeah, I do not own that one.  Oh, you did?  No, I don't own that one.  I told Jimmy.  So yesterday morning, got up early, even though, you know, crashed at like four in the morning. 
[00:11:30]  And it's just an awful rainy day here in New York.  And I walked to Starbucks and I walk in and I'm groggy because I literally woke up, threw  some like flip flops on and walked to Starbucks.  All right.  And as I walk into Starbucks, I look to my right.  I go, oh my God.  Nah, it can't be.  And then I start walking to the counter to throw my coffee order in and I'm waiting online.  There's one person ahead of me.  So I look again.  I'm like, holy crap, it is him.  It's key to the story. 
[00:12:00]  So just bear with me.  It's him.  So then I order my coffee.  And what I want to do is take my coffee now and introduce myself to this very famous man.  And as I turn on my coffee, he is gone.  He's out of the Starbucks.  Lost my opportunity.  Right.  So I go to throw the milk and all that, you know, that's at the station.  And as I'm doing that, a guy in Starbucks recognizes me.  He goes, oh, my God, Opie.  Love your show.  Love, you know, the show, whatever.  I listen all the time. 
[00:12:30]  I can't believe you're in Starbucks.  All right.  Shut up.  You tell him.  So I'm like, thanks.  But you have no idea how surreal it was in here, like literally two seconds ago.  You were saying how much you love the show.  And you're saying hi to me, Opie.  And I'm like, do you realize the guy I'm named after was right there?  Opie.  Opie was right there.  The Opie.  Ron Howard.  No, it was some guy named Greg. 
[00:13:00]  I was going to say Dick Ebersole.  Right.  So the guy keeps talking to me.  He doesn't care that actually Ron Howard was there.  I'm like, no, do you understand?  I'm Opie.  But I got the name from the guy that was just standing right there.  Yeah.  I go, did you see where he went?  I got to meet this guy.  And he's like, no.  But his girlfriend, I guess, goes, I crossed the street.  So I get my coffee and I go outside.  I'm looking around like a lunatic.  I mean, it's early in the morning.  There's no one around.  I lost my opportunity. 
[00:13:30]  I'm like, you got to be kidding me.  The guy I'm named after was right in the same Starbucks as me.  I run outside.  I can't find him.  And I'm ready to walk home.  Like, it might be worth it to just cross the street to see if maybe he, you know, hopped  into a store and he's going to come back out.  So I cross the street.  And behind like this van, that's the reason I didn't see him, under some scaffolding is  Ron Howard, a.k.  Opie, and his wife.  So I walk up to him like a complete lunatic stalker.  You know me.  Jimmy knows me. 
[00:14:00]  I don't do this often.  I enjoy.  It's got to be a biggie.  I enjoy, you know, spotting a celebrity and all.  But for the most part, it's like I could take it or leave it.  But in this case, I couldn't leave it.  So I walk right up to him.  I go, Mr. Howard.  He goes, yeah.  I go, uh, all awkward.  I'm like, uh, I'm not, I'm not.  I'm named after you.  He goes, really?  I go, yeah, I'm.  Nice to meet you, Ron.  No.  Right, right.  I go, I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  And it was one of the greatest moments ever. 
[00:14:30]  He goes, I've heard of you.  I've known about.  He goes, I've known about you for about eight years.  It came to my attention that there was a guy on the radio that was named Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  He goes, you guys got in trouble with that church thing.  I'm like, ah, yeah, that.  And I don't know if he's a religious guy.  So I'm downplaying it like.  Right.  I go.  But the cool thing about it is I got articles from all over the world.  And the only word you can recognize in the articles is Opie.  And he starts laughing.  I'm cracking up Ron Howard. 
[00:15:00]  And then we talked about satellite radio and are the two companies merging.  I'm like, no, that's never going to happen.  And he had a meeting with XM and it went well, but he's not sure if he wants to do anything with it.  And his wife's there, blah, blah, blah.  We're just having a good time.  And then he goes, so how long is it has Opie is Opie your radio name?  I go, no, I got that when I was eight years old.  I go, which was cool.  But now that I'm in my 40s, it's.  And I look at him like, well, you know how it is.  And he starts laughing again.  He starts laughing again.  I'm cracking him up, right? 
[00:15:30]  So all of a sudden I'm fast forwarding like.  I'm going to be in his next movie.  We're going to be pals.  Pals exchange phone numbers.  Yeah, you know how that goes.  Opie, how you doing?  You know how that goes, right?  Oh, yeah, of course.  You get caught up in the moment.  You get caught up in the moment like, oh, this is so obvious.  I'm going to be in his next film.  There's something here that he's noticing and I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going  to be discovered.  Oh, so I'm like, I don't want to delusional bastard.  I talked him for 10 minutes, him and his wife.  They were, they were the greatest people.  I said, you know, we'd love to have him on the show, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:16:00]  And I finally said, all right, I'm really sorry to bother you.  And I leave.  So then I go back to my apartment and I'm sitting there with my Starbucks and I'm just, I'm just  obsessing.  I'm, I felt like you, Jimmy, no offense.  I'm like my whole life since I was eight years old.  I've been named, you know, Opie after this guy.  I met him finally.  And I've always wondered if I would ever meet the guy, you know, it just, it's, it's always  been in the back of my head.  I'm sitting on the couch with my coffee.  The theory was the universe would actually end if they had come together. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  So, uh, I'm sitting on the couch doing, and I'm like, I got to go out there with my camera.  So I grabbed my video camera, like a lunatic.  It's raining.  I got an umbrella and I, and I, I walked back.  I'm like, what are the odds he's still there?  But I got to try.  I got to try.  He was that close.  I got to get a picture.  Right.  So I walk, uh, to where he was and he's still there.  I go, get out of here.  So I'm holding the camera and I'm crossing the street and he looks at me all weird.  Like, how do I know this guy? 
[00:17:00]  Like, cause he already forgot about me.  And as I got closer, he went, oh, I just talked to him.  That's why I know.  Oh, you're already forgotten.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I'm not even going to try to sit here and make believe.  Oh, what happened to the movie and the cell phone numbers you exchanged.  Right, right.  And the, hey me, it's me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're cracking him up.  And then I did the rookie move that everyone does, but it worked.  I go, uh, I, I never asked for pictures, but I ran all the way home to get my camera.  Can I get a picture with you?  You know?  Get my camera, I only take pictures with celebrities with. 
[00:17:30]  So he goes, he goes, sure.  And, uh, he takes a picture and, uh, and the picture's up on opianthony.com.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is right there.  Me and the guy I'm named after ever since I was eight years old.  This, this was like a great moment for me.  And then I'm like, and then I'm feeling it.  I'm like, so, uh, you guys live up here?  You know?  Cause he's in my neighborhood.  He goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In New York.  He goes, uh, we got, we got, uh, we got a place. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  A few blocks from here.  Right.  I go, really?  And then I, then I feel like I, uh, I have something in common with, with him.  And I'm like, I was, I was going to buy.  And, uh, I got rejected by the co-op board just two weeks ago.  And him and his wife are like, Oh, that's so sad.  Come stay with us.  Right.  Right.  And I, and I go, uh, they didn't even meet me.  They rejected me without even meeting me.  And they're like, ah, you seem like a nice guy.  And I'm like, well, it must be that sex for Sam.  And I think they Googled my name.  And then I go, you know, when they threw Opie in the, in the Google search, too bad your 
[00:18:30]  stuff didn't come up.  And then I got another laugh from Ron Howard.  And then I, I felt like I was a complete stalker.  I'm like, all right, I gotta go.  And then his wife's like, you're lucky.  Cause the only reason we're still here is we're waiting for our daughter and she's late,  which is Bryce Howard.  Yes.  The famous Bryce Howard, uh, the fine Hollywood actress.  Wow.  You're running with greatness over the weekend.  I said AK Opie instead of AKA, whatever, dude.  Now you're going to have to have a similar conversation if you ever meet Andy Griffith. 
[00:19:00]  It won't be the exact same one, but no, very similar.  I was named after your TV son, mister.  But it was, uh, it was one of those moments for me.  So I think it's the second, uh, greatest celebrity picture I've ever gotten.  That's a biggie.  I think that's a biggie for me.  That's, that's a biggie for me personally.  That's a biggie.  But just in general, that's a pretty big one.  Uh, Jimmy, of course, though, on, on the scale, how does that rate?  Is that, uh, is that a biggie or?  He's a very famous guy.  I mean, Richie Cunningham.  He's been, been in the business for many, many years. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, his whole life.  Yeah, whole life.  Ten years old.  Directed some great movies.  Very powerful director.  I would, I would have gotten, I'm not a Ron, I mean, I don't have a connection around Howard  like you do, but I would absolutely love to get a shot with him.  Yeah.  Clinton, you can't, you can't compare it to Clinton.  I mean, Clinton.  The Clinton one is still probably the biggest one you got.  He's going to stick over the button.  I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  He could have destroyed the earth.  We're only here because he's allowing us.  He could have hit the button and wiped it all out.  Okay.  That puts it in perspective to a guy that, you know, stands behind a camera. 
[00:20:00]  Steve from New York City.  Wow.  Tell that Ron Howard story again.  Yawn.  Well, then go check out Whoopi Goldberg.  That's your choice.  That's your choice, Steve.  That's right, Steve, with your negativity, a couple of men taking pictures.  Did you yawn the whole way through the story without turning your dial, you ass?  I yawned through the entire story.  I was just saying that.  I was never a Happy Days fan.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  See, when I'm listening to the radio and something is boring, guess what?  Guess what I do?  I don't sit through the whole thing. 
[00:20:30]  I listen.  And then go out of my way to instant feedback, the show that just told the boring story, Steve.  I listen till I can't take it anymore.  Then I write a little letter.  I had a very similar story one time.  I met Marion Ross.  And then another guy.  I don't know.  We got the haters today.  Someone from their cell phone.  SNL sucks.  Dane Cook equals not funny.  A taping of a live show.  They should let that show die.  Read this on the air, pussy.  Whoa.  Why would...  All right.  Challenging observation, Randall. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  Read it on the air.  Now what?  What's going to happen?  Because I read it.  What's going to happen now that I read it?  How was the show, by the way?  How was SNL?  I thought it was...  I thought it was okay.  It wasn't like, you know, an SNL you're going to remember for years to come.  But there were some funny...  There were some funny bits.  The killers were amazing.  Dane Cook's opening stand-up was great.  I thought it was really good.  And it was amazing because I was talking to him at the after parties.  He said he was trying out that set at the Cellar. 
[00:21:30]  And I'm like...  And he goes, I wasn't even really feeling confident about it.  But I said, what the hell?  I'll do it.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  You're going to be on SNL and you decide just to do new material you were trying out at the Cellar?  And then, of course, we were comparing notes about being on Letterman and stuff.  That was kind of neat.  Oh, boy.  It was a surreal moment.  Let's go to Jeff in Florida.  Jeff.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Jimmy Cake?  Hi, Jeff.  Hey, Opie, I wanted to know when you talked to Ron, did you by chance tell him that you were a millionaire board-off who sat on Letterman's count? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I mean, hey, get the facts out.  Thank you, Jeff.  Let's go to Tom in New York City.  Tom.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Good morning.  Yo, dude, I can't believe you actually went home, sat there for a little bit, and then you grabbed your camera and went back out.  No, it sucks.  I did exactly what I make fun of Jimmy.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I'm doing.  That is hysterical.  You're like, that is, like, kind of stalking.  You must have felt so funny crossing the street again to go meet the guy.  Dude, and he saw me calling to have a camera. 
[00:22:30]  It was such an awkward moment.  And I was thinking about Jimmy the whole time because I'm like, this is what I make fun of Jimmy for.  I honestly don't think you would have done that for anybody else except, like, a Clinton or somebody, you know, a huge star.  I think it's just the fact that it was, you know, Opie.  Well, this has been in the back of my head since I was eight years old.  So, as you're telling me this, like, yesterday, Opie called me yesterday and we were talking about it.  And the whole time he's leading up to the story about the Starbucks and everything, I'm thinking, well, where's your camera?  Did you have your camera?  Of course, Jimmy.  He's thinking that.  Yeah.  And it was good you did it, man, because it was, like, it's embarrassing for five minutes. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And then, as you know, he forgot about it.  Before the film, before the digital image had been captured, he forgot you were alive.  Right.  The speed of light.  But now you have it.  It's a cool story and you got it.  So what?  That's all right.  It's silly.  You ran across the street with your camera like a youngster.  And if you don't like the story, then, I don't know, go listen to Whoopi or something.  Dude, it's only creepy if you do that with Dakota Fanning.  All right.  It's a little bit creepy.  Well, let me tell you, I snuck back into a room. 
[00:23:30]  Look, I normally don't do this, but I'm going to have to take you.  Someone is asking if Joe Namath would be cooler than Ron or Clinton.  Oh, he's a Jets fan, though.  I'm a Jets fan, but Namath was before my time.  Was he?  Yeah, absolutely.  When you were a kid, kid, though?  We didn't.  I knew of Joe Namath, but I wasn't old enough to completely appreciate what he was doing on the field.  Yeah.  No, my Jets experience, unfortunately, starts with, like, Richard Todd. 
[00:24:00]  Ooh.  Exactly.  I wish it was with Joe Namath, but it was Richard Todd.  That's who I remember.  That's when I really started getting into football and was understanding what was going on.  So, all right, why don't we take a break?  We've got to ask Jimmy about Pittsburgh when we get back.  You missed Arlie.  You missed Arlie.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, dude.  I know.  Arlie Ermey.  All I did was I was just thinking about, oh, my God, Jimmy's missing this.  I was really, very rarely am I hurt to be gone. 
[00:24:30]  He was very candid.  He stayed there for, what, an hour?  Yeah.  Yeah, on our XM show, we had Arlie Ermey from, of course, Full Metal Jacket.  The drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket.  I mean, and the movie.  Mississippi Burning and this new one, Chance of Massacre 2.  Yep, yep, yep.  He recited the entire opening sequence to Full Metal Jacket with the curses and everything.  Wait, are you going to give away what he almost did?  Yeah.  All right, we'll do it after the break because Jimmy told me what he almost did on Friday. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, no.  I probably already have it figured out.  Well, yeah, unless you're a dummy, you know exactly what's coming next.  So jealous.  But that'll be a tease for the waterheads out there.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:30]  That was only heard in New York, right?  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Monday.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-3.  Franco from Oceanside.  Yeah, we got to stick up for Dane Cook.  He writes, Dane Cook, not funny?  I would just like to congratulate that guy for wasting 10 cents on a text message  that 95% of the country would disagree with.  Yes.  Text messages cost 10 cents?  I don't even know. 
[00:26:00]  They got a sponsor for Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  It was so funny to hear someone go, Fatty Pig Fatty.  Sponsored by?  Sponsored by?  Like a real, like a real...  Fatty Pig Fatty is brought to you by H57 Hootia?  What?  What is that?  Hootia?  It's a product called H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H-57.com.  There you go. 
[00:26:30]  All the videos of the Fatty Pig Fatty contest are up on YouTube.  Really, really funny stuff.  Our current leader is 430 pounds, and the contest is pretty much stopped.  Are we going to get a woman walking through those doors that is bigger or heavier than 430 pounds?  430.  We even got a new scale.  Oh, we do?  It goes up to 1,000 pounds.  Yeah.  It's a little thing, too.  It's bigger than a normal scale, but it's not like an elephant-sized scale.  But we have it. 
[00:27:00]  We have it.  When we need it, it comes out.  Big Heifer comes in, and you got a chance to win a lot of money.  A lot of money.  I know down in Philly at WISP, they're recruiting fatties.  They're recruiting fatties, and they're going to ship them up here if they find one that's heavier than 430 pounds.  If I was a guy and I knew some big, fat broad, I would be like, look, you come down here.  I want a finder's fee, of course, but come on down.  What are you waiting for?  It's a huge amount of money. 
[00:27:30]  Thousands of dollars.  Yep.  And we'll even get you right up here in a horse trailer, throw you in the back.  You can hang your fat head out and just look at traffic behind you.  Eat some oats.  We've had a great start to the contest.  Yeah.  A great start.  It's $10 a pound.  So the girl who's in the lead, Crystal from Cleveland, if she wins this whole thing, she's  going to win $4,300.  Yep.  Thanks to Hootia57.  There you go.  H-57.  Or whatever.  Hootia.  Where is it again? 
[00:28:00]  There's no dash?  No dash.  Oh, I said there's a dash.  Yeah.  I'll type it.  I'll type the roll.  Maybe I'll stop.  H-57.  Hootia.  Sponsoring the contest.  We haven't had any action since Big Rhonda and her huge herniation that Craig the intern  sucked on like you-know-what.  That video's up on YouTube as well.  Craig's a good boy.  I respect that.  I respect Craig.  I don't like his hat tilting nonsense, but the boy sucked a hernia.  He's earned his way into my heart.  And he made Bob get sick, which is always fun to watch. 
[00:28:30]  Bob knows how he makes everyone, including the audience, feel.  That video's being viewed a lot on YouTube.  It's interesting what the listeners pick up on and want to see.  Secret Agent Man by Club Soda Kenny?  Yep.  That's being viewed a lot on YouTube right now.  It's teetering on maybe going viral, that one.  And people think he's retarded.  The people that don't know who Club Soda Kenny is, just people from around America that  just happen to stumble on this.  I think it's some retarded gentleman singing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Sounds to me that they know exactly who Club Soda Kenny is.  Yeah.  Where's the inaccuracy here?  You guys ever keep track of your YouTube viewing?  No.  Like, I started by watching the Fatty Pig Fatty clips.  I threw Opie and Anthony in a search, and I'm watching Fatty Pig Fatty clips.  And then they make suggestions and stuff.  And next thing you know, I'm watching kittens screaming like babies.  I'm like, how did this happen?  You get sidetracked.  You go elsewhere. 
[00:29:30]  It always gives you a couple of other suggestions when you're done watching your video.  So you end up somewhere completely different.  That's how I ended up last night on Magician Tricks Gone Wrong.  But where did you start?  Hysterical.  Where did you start at?  I think I started on, oh God, what was it?  See, that's the bit.  You start on something ridiculous.  Something that had nothing to do with it.  I don't even remember.  You weren't thinking, I'm going to go check out Magic Tricks Gone Bad.  It was something that went wrong that I started on.  Oh, okay.  And then it kind of went to Magician Tricks Gone Wrong. 
[00:30:00]  And it is hysterical.  There's a couple of these.  Who knew this trick wasn't working out for magicians out there?  They have a knife and it's on a board sticking straight up.  And the magician covers it with a thin paper bag.  And then there's four other paper bags that don't have anything on it that are just kind of standing up.  And he doesn't know which one the knife is under.  So he takes his bare hand and is supposed to walk up to the five now thin paper bags that are all standing straight up. 
[00:30:30]  And to four of them just go, wham, wham, wham, wham.  And then the last one, he pulls it off and there's the knife.  My God, how did he do it?  You don't know how many times they hit the wrong bag and that knife goes right through a magician's hand.  And it's not a trick.  It's not one of these, oh, my goodness, it's gone through my hand, you know.  And then he slides it through his hand, pulls it out, ta-da.  It is, ah, oh, my God. 
[00:31:00]  Where an emergency crew has to run up and the show's over, Johnny.  The show is over.  This guy put a knife through his hand.  Hysterical.  And another one was this magician doing the same type of trick with the Styrofoam cups.  And the old style, remember they used to have the little thing on your desk, a little pin that would stick up and you'd stick notes on it and stuff?  It's one of those things underneath the Styrofoam cup.  And he brought a woman up from the audience and grabbed her hand and started crushing the paper cups with it. 
[00:31:30]  And the woman is, like, backing off with her hand.  She didn't want to do this.  And the second to last one, he slams down and you just see her hand abruptly stop.  She screeches and pulls it back and pulls the thing out of her hand.  And, again, let off stage.  They're blurring out the magician's face.  She's being interviewed.  She's suing.  And, by the way, that's a knife trick I've seen done.  Any magician worth his salt will do that with his testicles.  Nate G from Maine. 
[00:32:00]  You were talking about this in the office, Anthony.  He just writes, Blackstone halftime show.  Yeah, that was the one that I finished watching the magicians screwing up was the Blackstone halftime show.  I think it was 1987, Orange Bowl.  And he does this big magic extravaganza, the announcer.  And now Mr. Blackstone will make appear beautiful women.  And they're supposed to come out of these big square boxes that are painted like cards, like fanned out cards. 
[00:32:30]  And that doesn't work.  He's supposed to pull a rabbit out of this hat that he's pulling these handkerchiefs out of, this old hack magician thing.  And you see the rabbit fall on the floor.  And he's rifling through the handkerchiefs trying to find the rabbit.  And he finds it as this bad lip sync song that he's supposed to be singing is playing in the background.  But the best thing is this box that fits a human comes up through the bottom of the platform of this big stage that they're on. 
[00:33:00]  Now, if the box can come up there, you know, obviously that's where the girl is going to come from, the bottom.  So he starts waving his arms around this box with these mirrored sides.  But it's that kind of two-way mirror where depending on which side the light is on, you can see through it or you can't.  So I guess the trick is supposed to be at one point he goes ta-da and lights come on in the box and the woman's in the box. 
[00:33:30]  And then they open the door and let her out.  Well, somebody cued the light too early.  And you see the woman struggling to pull herself up into this box from the bottom of the platform.  So Harry Blackstone just kind of puts his body against the glass like he was away from it, waving his hands all magically.  He throws his body against the glass and still trying to wave his arm, trying to hide the fact that you can see this woman being pushed up into the box. 
[00:34:00]  It is so bad everything he did went wrong.  Did anyone cheer when he –  Yeah, it was like 1987, so people are still stupid back then.  Wait, now are you sure this wasn't a goof?  No, it absolutely was not a goof.  This was – he was a serious magician.  It's on there if you want to take a look.  You could just tell it went wrong.  The boxes didn't fall down and let the women out because the wind was too strong.  And Blackstone wasn't one of those magicians that was into goofing on magic. 
[00:34:30]  Like he was totally into it.  It was – it's such a catastrophe.  It's really fun to watch.  I guess if you put in Blackstone Magician, you'll be able to punch it up.  Very funny how he tries to hide the girl popping out of the box though.  Yeah, there's the box.  And you could tell like the girl's got a – if the box can come out of the stage, so can the girl.  Hey, good point.  You know, never thought of it that way before.  It's a ridiculous magic act.  They take the sides off to show that nothing's in there. 
[00:35:00]  And then they put the sides back on.  They're just running through it because Jimmy's watching it.  I'm looking at it right now.  I'm sure you can watch it at home.  And now he's going to do his little mumbo-jumbo with his hands.  He's wearing a red, white, and blue hat like an ass.  And he's waving at it.  Look, the light turns on.  There she is.  They're pushing her up.  So he stands in front.  Nothing to see here.  What a tool.  He jumps in front of her. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, that is really funny.  But there's not enough of him to cover what's happening.  You can see it.  And then when she gets out of the box, watch.  She finally gets up.  She's still putting her crown on.  And she's pissed.  She is so annoyed that this trick went wrong.  Look at her face.  She's adjusting her crown.  I'll bet you that I don't like you.  I feel a wreck.  I bet you the light cue the guy did on purpose, because I bet you that magician was a prick backstage.  Probably was.  And make sure that light cue is done properly or else.  I'll have your job. 
[00:36:00]  I'll have your head.  And he didn't realize the guy was union and just didn't care.  I don't care.  Flick.  Hey, Artie, watch this.  Click.  Stupid broad climbing up through the hole.  It is so much better than watching TV.  Last night, once again, I'm sitting there and just want to kill an hour and watch some TV.  There's nothing to watch.  I just grab my laptop and I just start watching YouTube videos.  Yeah.  My favorite thing to watch on YouTube.  I have like three o'clock in the morning, just giggled myself to sleep watching dumb Bob vomit. 
[00:36:30]  I went to like Bob Kelly puking.  There's like six different videos.  Oh, there's so many of them.  Yeah.  You think it's the same one?  No.  Six different videos of him vomiting.  And it is hysterical.  Every time I see one, I laugh.  Stupid weak belly.  We got like 700 videos up there right now.  About 700 Opie and Anthony videos.  All right.  Anyway, R. Lee Ermey, Friday, in studio at XM.  We said hi to him and he talked for an hour.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  He gave us great radio over there at XM on Friday.  And we were just thinking about you, Jimmy.  He was sitting in your seat.  I know.  And I go to E-Rock and go, make sure you got pictures of R. Lee Ermey sitting in Norton's  seat.  It'll drive him nuts.  No, I actually like that he sat in my seat.  It was a great honor to share it with him.  Of course.  I love that guy.  I would love to meet him.  I mean, he's one of those guys that's like a goal for me to meet because he's the drill  sergeant from Full Metal Jacket.  He's right in there.  Yeah, those pictures are up on opiananthony.com and I'm sure the video will be up on YouTube  a little bit of the interview. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't realize that Bob and Rich were in here.  I want to smack both of their faces.  Both of their Middle Eastern looking faces I want to smack to Terrace sitting there with  R. Lee Ermey.  Yeah.  Weren't you in a movie?  Yeah.  Rich wouldn't know.  Bob's trying to pontificate about a foreign policy.  I'm sure the problem is it.  Pretty much, you got it down.  That's what happened.  The picture of him and R. Lee Ermey.  I thought for a second it was R. Lee Ermey on Parrish Island.  I'm like, oh no, it's just Bobby talking to him.  Oh, that really hurts. 
[00:38:00]  That one hurts.  Is it true you almost flew back from Pittsburgh?  Oh, it's 100%.  Tell Anthony.  Pittsburgh's a one hour flight and I said to myself, I'm going to get up and I'm going  to get on a flight at six or seven o'clock, wherever the first flight out of Pittsburgh  is, and I'm going to fly back here and I'm going to blow off the press I have in Pittsburgh  and I'm going to come here and I'm going to meet R. Lee Ermey and I'm going to fly back  on the 150 flight.  The only reason I didn't do it, because Kenny's like, you're going to hit traffic, is because  I didn't know if he'd show up because it was the XM side.  I'm like, what if he doesn't show up? 
[00:38:30]  You'll feel like the biggest dick and you can't, I blew off the press I did there.  I did one TV interview with a guy who hated my guts.  It was horrid.  Is it on?  Did they show it?  I don't know.  It was on TV there somewhere.  Well, then I'm sure it'll end up on YouTube.  It was just a boring, unfunny interview.  See, that's the stuff we need for YouTube.  It was just an unfunny, awkward interview.  Good.  I want to see it.  And then I did like an hour with the midday girl, Megan, there, which was actually the  most fun I've had interviewing in a long time.  She's on K-Rock in Pittsburgh, who was great.  So we talked for a while. 
[00:39:00]  Those guys are on our radar big time.  They're really good, man.  You've got to do something for Pittsburgh.  They promoted the show.  They're all fans of the show.  They came down to support me.  It was really, it was a great week there.  I was just, I almost blew it all off to come back here and meet him.  I was so mad.  And the fact that I see those two dopes in photos with him makes me sick to my stomach.  It hurts.  Well, it should.  It was cool.  Hung out like for a while.  Talked about everything, man.  Got pretty candid about talking about his relationship with his father, which wasn't very good.  Kind of what drove him into the core. 
[00:39:30]  His dad was like, they grew up on a farm years ago.  Didn't have electricity or anything.  And his father had the, like, he's one of six boys.  So his father was just kind of.  An alcoholic.  Yeah, an alcoholic.  He said, not us.  And just like a real, like, bastard to deal with.  Always called him idiot and stupid and just degraded him all the time.  And that changed when he went into the core and came out.  Said he beat him one day arm wrestling. 
[00:40:00]  And just said, now you know, now you know I could kick your ass.  And things changed after that.  Oh, yeah.  Said they can spend about 10, 15 minutes in a room now together.  Oh, his father's still living.  Yeah.  He goes, I asked him why he doesn't write a biography.  Because his life, you know, he's had a lot of fascinating things.  Been in Vietnam and all the, going from that into movies and stuff.  And he goes, well, I'm still living, first of all.  He goes, but I also have a few stories about my father that I might not want him to read. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, okay.  He hates his father.  Yeah, really can't stand his father.  I'd like to meet his father and see the guy that created him.  Yeah.  Because believe me, you have to have a lot of bad things happen for you to be that good at yelling at other people.  It's not natural for one person to be that good at yelling at other men.  And what did he say about his own son?  His own son has long hair.  Yeah.  And he basically said, I guess he just doesn't respect me or something.  Yeah, doesn't respect his old man and, you know. 
[00:41:00]  The guy was so open.  Imagine me an early army son.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And you want to grow your hair long?  You want to grow your hair long and maybe be in a band or something.  Right.  Oh, he was so open and honest.  It was a lot of fun to listen to.  Yeah.  Hey, before we take a break, Anthony in Vegas, if you haven't seen it, the feedback is going nuts.  If you haven't seen it, the Hitler speech thanking ONA for victory over France should get a MacBook.  Comment on this video.  It's funny and really well done.  I haven't seen that yet. 
[00:41:30]  Is that on YouTube?  I haven't seen that one either.  I haven't seen that one.  It's hard to see everything.  There's so much on there.  Because someone else said that they threw our faces into some kind of old Hitler 1940s film.  Jesus.  I haven't seen it yet.  Where he's giving a speech.  The same guy is, you know, throwing a couple of feedbacks at us about it.  So I don't know.  I'll have to check it out after the show again.  Great.  Oh, ask Jimmy about the guy who had to tinkle.  Saturday show at 7.  By the way, Jimmy killed.  Everyone's saying you killed in Pittsburgh, by the way. 
[00:42:00]  It was fun.  Very fun.  What was that?  Great crowd.  Really great crowds came out.  No, it's just some guy.  There's nothing to talk about.  Some guy I smashed because he had to pee.  What is it?  Oh.  Nothing.  It's just a guy.  It's what you comics do.  Yeah.  It was fun.  Pittsburgh was very nice to me.  All right.  We got the video up.  Opie, Anthony, and Hitler.  Finally, I would like to thank Hitler.  Great.  The two men who made it all possible.  The two men that made it possible.  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia. 
[00:42:30]  That's subtitles of Hitler.  Right.  He's ranting.  There goes that famous salute.  And there we are.  Oh.  And then it's me and Opie from Jimmy's HBO comedy special.  In the audience when they went to us with me doing my stupid bow.  With the help of Jimmy Norton and the legions of Loyal Pest.  That's very funny.  Oh, wow.  This is funny.  We will achieve total victory.  Oh, that's hilarious.  It's twisted.  On my HBO special. 
[00:43:00]  O&A named MVPs by Hitler.  Oh, my God.  Pest Daily is the name of the newspaper.  Wow, great job.  That is really funny.  Open Ant got up and took a bow.  And it's like a legendary bow because Ant did like a little tip and a flip of his arm.  I did a stupid like Renaissance era bow.  Yeah.  And that's the one they use.  And it is hilarious.  He got black and whited it up.  It really is great.  We fit into the crowd.  That's what's great about you.  I just wish I knew it was going to do that.  I would have worn something a little different.  Something that maybe matched.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  We'll step aside.  Take another break.  We got lots to do.  I mean, there's not much in the news today.  Everyone's talking football today.  But as far as huge stories.  Well, we got the congressman.  Oh, that's a big one.  They were talking about that all weekend.  It was the only story all the news was talking about.  Yeah, we'll talk about that a little bit when we get back.  We can't really read the transcripts over here, unfortunately.  But this guy, he was maybe wanted to have sex.  He likes the boys.  Oh, no.  Young boys or of age? 
[00:44:00]  16?  Young boys.  He's finished.  Little pages?  Finished.  He resigned immediately.  Who is he from where?  Florida.  Democrat?  Republican?  Republican.  Older man, huh?  Dude, older Republican who is on the...  He headed the committee on exploited children.  Yeah, this guy just really trips over it.  Talk about the fox guard in the hen house.  Give me those ribs, you.  LOL.  Ow.  We have audio on that?  We got the news stories?  Yeah, we'll figure it all out. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a virus.  The ONA virus.  Hopefully, you'll catch it soon.  Yes, I'm talking to you, Chicago.  That's right.  I'm talking to you. 
[00:45:00]  I couldn't be happier.  I couldn't be happier.  About what?  I've had enough of the Republicans and their conservative morality.  I'm really sick and tired of them.  And I just love the fact this guy is in, as we would say, Dutch.  Oh, he's in it.  He's been a naughty boy, this Mr. Foley.  Naughty, naughty boy.  Mr. Foley.  Every good man's fault.  Wanted to know about the young lad.  The young lad, yes.  What a creep.  Oh, dear.  My little congressional page. 
[00:45:30]  Woo!  Young William.  Oh, this Mark's a naughty boy.  Oh, I loved when I heard this, man.  Yep.  This is Republican.  Congressman Foley, I guess.  And it says, warning, sexually explicit language.  Reader discretion is advised on the transcripts of this email conversation he had back and forth, like a chat conversation. 
[00:46:00]  In 2003, by the way.  Yeah.  Three years later, it comes out.  Oh, this is going back.  And a lot of Republicans knew about this.  They're now going through to see who knew.  With the midterm elections coming up, ho, ho.  If you knew about this and didn't do anything, you're really going to have to campaign against the guy you're running against really better have done something really, really bad.  How great would it be if the president knew?  How great?  Knew about it? 
[00:46:30]  Didn't know?  Well, they asked.  I was watching some of the talk shows yesterday.  And they were saying, one of the spokesmen for the White House was saying, well, the president learned this when the public did, when it came out in the news, nothing of it.  I almost said the word.  Yeah.  Because his brother knew.  Yeah.  Jeb is talking like crazy down in Florida.  And you think his brother's, look, if some guy you work with is doing that, you don't think  you're going to call your brother up and go, dude, guess what this guy's doing? 
[00:47:00]  Look, look, look.  Let me read some of this.  Let me read some of this.  All right.  That is so hot.  At your age, I would do it daily.  Do you do it in the shower or in bed?  Wait, we could read some of this.  Who do you want to be?  Oh, I know you want to be the young lad.  I want to be the young lad.  The young lad.  I want to be Mr. Foley. 
[00:47:30]  Please.  Hey, here's the story.  Here's the latest.  Congressman Mark Foley's resignation was abrupt and shocking.  I am deeply sorry and I apologize for letting down my family and the people of Florida I have had the privilege to represent,  said Foley in a short written statement.  For what purposes, gentlemen, can Florida rise?  The sixth-term Republican and member of the GOP leadership made no mention of his emails with a former male congressional page  or concerns, according to GOP sources close to Foley, that devastating information was about to become public. 
[00:48:00]  In fact, hours later, it did.  ABC News reported a number of sexually graphic instant messages between Foley and male congressional pages.  What are you wearing?  He asked in one.  T-shirts and shorts, the teen replied.  Love to slip them off you, Foley allegedly said.  And in another, Foley asked.  Do I make you a little horny?  A little, said the teen.  Cool, replied Foley.  Ugh.  Oh, he's so in trouble. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, boy, is he in Dutch.  There's no way to say I meant to say.  No.  Yeah, well, why no criminal charges?  Uh, they're talking about it.  They're hashing it over.  There was no immediate response from Foley's office to those alleged messages,  but a spokesman confirmed to CNN that Foley did have five email exchanges last year with a 16-year-old page,  asking him, how old are you, in one, and in another, he asks the young man to send me a pic of you as well.  The young man forwarded that email, according to a government watchdog group that posted it online, 
[00:49:00]  to a congressional staffer, writing the word sick 13 times.  The group's director got it from a Hill staffer and sent it to the House Ethics Committee and the FBI.  Because Representative Foley was using a personal email account to send the page emails,  the former page emails, and the young man was clearly made very uncomfortable by the emails,  we thought it was a matter appropriate for the House Ethics Committee to investigate.  Law enforcement sources won't comment, but there is no indication at this point of any criminal probe, 
[00:49:30]  and it is unclear how the House Ethics Committee proceeded.  The page was uncomfortable? I mean, how many messages, though?  No, this was a different one. I think they ratted him out.  I don't think it's this one. I think it's a different one that ratted him.  So this page was into it?  Oh, well, yeah.  Into the exchange?  Into the exchange?  Good form, sure.  This boy knew? How could he not know?  Young man.  Young up-and-coming page trying to make his way in the political world.  There's just a little bit more audio, and then we'll get into the transcript. 
[00:50:00]  Foley's resignation sent shockwaves through the Capitol.  House Speaker Dennis Hastert was visibly angry.  He resigned from the House.  As of now, he's done the right thing.  I have asked John Shimkus, who is the head of the page board, to look into this issue regarding Congressman Foley.  We want to make sure that all our pages are safe and the page system is safe.  How disturbing is this?  Well, none of us are very happy about it.  Now, what makes this all the more surprising is that Congressman Mark Foley is a co-chair of the Missing and Exploited Children Caucus, 
[00:50:30]  and he also has written some of the most recent legislation to try to crack down on Internet predators.  Jesus Christ.  See?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You're in trouble.  We always said this.  We always said this.  The people that are so involved in a lot of these things are usually doing them.  You know how much he must have loved reading those? 
[00:51:00]  Let me have those transcripts so I can write some legislation.  Oh, you know it.  He said what to that youngster?  Oh, oh.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Yeah, I'm going to need every one of these six, sick pictures delivered to my office.  Secret agent man.  That's who caught him.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Away. 
[00:51:30]  Your name.  Your name.  Unbelievable.  Yes, some of the transcripts.  It starts off innocently enough.  Well, let's see how far we can go with this.  Jimmy wants to be the page.  I want to be the page because I have smooth buttocks.  I'll be Math 54.  Now, I would gather his last name being Foley.  What's his first name?  Mark.  Okay, that's the M and the A.  His middle name has got something with an A in it.  Mark A. Foley 54.  Boy, this guy really tried to hide, didn't he? 
[00:52:00]  What a dope.  How about Repub Rep, smuck?  What a dope this guy is.  He uses his initials.  F-L-A-R-E-P.  That's a good one.  He's one of those older men that just doesn't understand how easy it is to trace things on the internet.  Yeah, he didn't quite get the internet.  You know.  I don't understand.  That's like me using Jay Norton.  Right.  He'll never know.  What a dope.  That is funny, Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  It starts out innocently enough with just a, hey.  And then I have an auto response.  Scrounging for food.  BRB.  Okay.  Keep scrounging.  And then six minutes later, I come back and I say, boo.  And for some reason.  Wait.  So the page started this conversation.  No, the guy did.  Mark started it.  Yeah, he started with hay.  Oh, okay.  It showed up on his auto response.  So when he was done eating his food, that gives him those washboard abs.  Yes.  He sat down, saw the auto response had been doled out to this congressman and gave him an answer. 
[00:53:00]  Boo.  So I write back, boo, dude.  Probably meant boo.  Yeah.  Couldn't spell it.  The fact that you're 55 and trying to hook up with me and calling me dude is creepy enough.  And the fact that you can't spell.  Yeah.  He's just so worked up.  He doesn't want to type in that extra O.  Yeah, he's too busy.  He's wiping stuff off his hands.  It's just a mess.  So you wrote boo, dude.  And I wrote LOL.  LOL.  So let's see if that would be literally how it would work. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Boo.  Boo, dude.  Ah!  Ah!  No, that was an R-O-F-L, Jimmy.  But why would you laugh out loud at boo, dude?  Why?  I don't get it.  All right.  So I go LOL, and then I go, where'd you go this afternoon?  I'm in Pensacola.  Had to catch a plane.  Just in case you didn't know what my name was from this, you can now get it from my schedule  of what I did that day and where I went. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because your excuse would be, ah, there's another, you know, mark out there that's 54.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, this isn't me, obviously.  I was thinking of you when I was in row 5, seat 2F.  Right.  I don't know why you'd be in row 5, seat 2F, but you get the picture.  Of course.  What a dope I am.  Uh, uh, oh, well, that's fun.  Indeed.  What are you doing in Pensacola?  Now in my hotel room.  Well, like, why did you go there?  And here's another one, just in case you don't know who the guy is, for the campaign. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think it's, is this Genghis Khan?  Hold on, someone wants to tell us what Bo means instead of Boo.  Steven in Virginia Beach, what's up?  Yeah, I'm not positive, but I think Bo is B-O, back on, like back online.  No, dude, just a guy responding.  No, no, I, maybe it is, but I went Boo, and then the older, the older gentleman who  I had come to for council went, Bo, dude, he was trying to Boo me back and be young and 
[00:55:00]  hip.  It was just a typing error.  Well, Kevin from New York, uh, Bo probably means bend over, so.  Oh, well, okay.  Bend over, dude.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Uh, let's go to Bill in Queens.  Bill.  Guys.  Hey.  Hey, uh, I was a page years ago, and this is tame compared to the crap that, uh, that,  went on.  Nothing happened to me, but.  You must be fat and ugly.  Uh, I was really skinny.  Ooh.  And I had, like, yeah, I was kind of ugly when I was, like, little. 
[00:55:30]  And I know of a number of senators and representatives who, sober, would make passes in, like, the  Capitol building, the Rotary, where they all gather.  Yes, sir.  I was about to deliver files, and somebody, like, I know a buddy of mine had his butt  grabbed by four different representatives.  Um, we would get gifts in exchange for certain favors, and the girls got it worse than we 
[00:56:00]  did, than the guys did.  Well, I would hope so, but.  Yeah, certainly should be.  You know, it's, it's tragic all around.  Yeah.  But, I mean, I would hope that the girls would get it a little more.  I mean, for God's sake, they're in charge of our country.  All right, let's get back to the transcript, so.  Uh.  Where were we?  For the campaign, you, eh.  Yeah.  Have you officially announced yet?  Not yet.  Jesus.  Cool.  Cool.  Okay, now, here's where the creep meter starts really kicking in. 
[00:56:30]  Wait, do we have a, eh, eh, eh?  Here's where.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  After the cool, cool.  Cool.  Talking about the campaign, Pensacola, catching a plane.  It was creepy with the, you know, just a boo dude.  Uh, but, no, just a little chit-chat at first.  Yeah.  That's all you really need.  A little, a little chit-chat.  A page of, uh, text just to start the conversation.  And then, uh, you say, cool.  Cool, cool. 
[00:57:00]  How my favorite young stud doing.  Um.  Tired and sore.  I didn't know waltzing could make you sore.  From what?  Wait a minute.  This kid's 16 and he's doing the waltzing?  Waltzing.  Uh, hmm.  That's why he's talking back to this guy so long.  Yeah, no wonder he didn't just log off after that remark.  He's a waltzer.  You waltzer.  That's one thing you don't want your, your father to, to find. 
[00:57:30]  And no father wants to hear his son is a waltzer.  Dad, I'm waltzing.  You don't want your daughter to be pregnant with the baby of a golfer or your son to be a waltzer.  Oh my God, this gets really creepy.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  I didn't know waltzing could make you sore.  From what?  What do you mean, from what?  From waltzing.  I'm sore from waltzing.  That's good.  You need a massage.  I'm, it's, uh, 739. 
[00:58:00]  He signed off.  32.  I signed off at 739.  37.  Signed back on at 740.  35.  Here's what that means.  He was, he was all frothed up and he hit the wrong button and jumped offline.  And he probably went, ah, damn it, god damn it, god damn internet connection.  And he called the front desk.  I want this internet hooked up or I'll campaign against you.  Or he got a, sir, Jeb Bush is on the phone. 
[00:58:30]  Just like hit every button, unplug your computer from the wall.  Just start kicking at your hard drive.  Mr. Marshall.  Stop.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  Hello, Paige.  Got to type quick.  Mr. Marshall will be here in five minutes.  I'll rub your sore backside.  Okay, Ralph.  I'm going to.  This.  Dude, I've been in dirty conversations. 
[00:59:00]  When you get like all of a sudden you're kicked offline.  He signed back on.  He probably took him a whole minute to, he kept flubbing his password.  He was so, he was all frothed up.  It took him a minute, less than a minute to get back on.  He couldn't get his password right.  He's like, ah, there's an F, there's a, wait, there's two Gs, a T.  Can't spell Foley.  His password's probably Foley.  It sure, yeah.  Rep Foley.  All right.  And he finally comes back and I go, got kicked off?  Must have! 
[00:59:30]  Ugh.  Tomorrow I have the first day of lacrosse practice.  Love to watch that.  Those great legs running.  Ha ha ha.  They aren't great.  That's why we have conditioning.  Two days running, three days lifting.  Every week.  Until the end of March.  Well, don't ruin my mental picture.  Oh.  LOL.  Sorry.  All right, go back and do it the right way now. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Well, don't ruin my mental picture.  Oh.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Sorry.  Nice.  You'll be way hot then.  Ha ha.  Hopefully.  Better be.  Well, I better let you go.  Do your thing.  Oh, okay.  Have fun campaigning.  Or however you spell it.  LOL. 
[01:00:30]  I'll see you in a couple of weeks.  Okay, now we're going to get into some problem areas.  Well, let's just say that you can leave.  I say we do the blank, blank game.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait, you know what to do over there?  I think, yeah.  You can leave one word off on that one.  Even if you leave both?  Yeah.  No, that's it.  You can, uh.  I would, I would, I don't know.  I think they're going to dump us.  No, not at all.  Guaranteed not with that one.  I think they will.  The boy's looking for help. 
[01:01:00]  I really think they'll dump us.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's take a little test.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got this working.  Yes.  Okay.  Did any girl give you a hand this weekend?  All right.  Let's check, please.  Checking.  Checking.  Checking.  Checking.  Checking.  Checking.  You don't even need to.  Yeah.  Thumbs up.  It's good, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  LOL. 
[01:01:30]  No.  No.  I'm single right now.  My last GF and I broke up a few weeks ago.  Are you, uh, oh, are you?  I don't know what context this is in.  I'm just sending it.  Are you good, so you're getting horny?  LOL.  A bit.  All right.  Do it the right way.  I just can't stop laughing.  This kid just laughs. 
[01:02:00]  He works on his body and he laughs.  How do you not love him?  Do it the right way, Anthony.  Come on.  Okay.  Are you good, so you're getting horny?  A bit.  Did you...  I'm supposed to hit the off button.  I car crashed the whole scene.  They're both dead.  Did you...  It yourself...  This weekend yourself?  No.  No. 
[01:02:30]  Been too tired and too busy.  Wow.  I'm never too busy.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Or tired.  Helps me sleep.  That's true.  Haven't been having a problem...  Haven't been having a problem with sleep, though.  I just walk in the door and collapse, well, at I East this weekend.  I'm sure.  Well, at least this weekend.  At least this weekend.  Yeah, it's just how it's printed out.  I don't do it very often normally, though. 
[01:03:00]  Why not?  At your age, seems like it would be daily.  Not me.  I'm not a horned dog.  Maybe two or three times a week.  That's a good number.  In the shower?  Actually, usually I don't do it in the shower.  Just because I shower in the morning.  And quickly.  Ha.  In the bed?  Ha ha.  I get up at 5.30 and I'm out of the house by 6.10.  On your back? 
[01:03:30]  No, face down.  Love details.  LOL.  All right, Jimmy.  You know the rules.  Okay.  And can you back up a little?  No, face down.  Love details.  Ha ha ha ha.  I see that.  Ha ha ha ha.  Two LOLs there, I see.  Yeah.  Really?  Do you really do it face down?  Yeah.  Kneeling?  The bed itself. 
[01:04:00]  Ugh.  Where do you un-  It?  Ha ha ha ha.  Towel.  Really?  Are we, uh, are we good?  No dump still?  All right.  Completely naked?  Well, ya.  Very nice.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I don't know if I could say that.  I'll just use the beep. 
[01:04:30]  Cute b***h bouncing in the air?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Well, I've never watched myself.  But ya, I guess.  Ah, I'm sure not.  Hmm.  Great visual.  I may try that.  It works.  Hmm.  Sound interesting.  I always use lotion and the hand.  But who knows?  I don't use lotion.  Takes too much time to clean up.  With a towel, you can just wipe off and go. 
[01:05:00]  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Where do you throw the towel?  Can you mail it to, uh, the Capitol Building, care of, MAF 54?  Congressman Moe.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Where do you throw the towel?  But you can't work it too hard, or it's not good.  In the laundry.  Just kinda slow rubbing?  Ya. 
[01:05:30]  Dump!  Okay, okay, we've pre...  I think we're reaching our dump point.  Dump!  Lotion in hand.  Ah, okay.  Ah, well, now they gotta dump that.  Yeah, now they gotta dump that.  Iraq, thank you.  You wanna say it again?  Is that...  Yeah.  I don't know, Al, I think you've been a little...  You've been a little panicky on that one.  Nah, I think that kinda draws it together, is what he has a problem with.  It might, but I mean, how many...  He's nodding his head yes right now.  There has to be a way of dancing around things.  The FCC has to just...  Nah, see, at this point, it could be that the kid's just playing a video game or something. 
[01:06:00]  Really?  I'm just gonna email somebody right now.  Are you hitting the dump button about now?  What are you wearing, you freak?  Okay, but you can't work it too hard or it's not good.  In the laundry.  Yeah, just kinda slow rubbing.  Yeah.  Or you'll...  Or...  Or you'll, uh, rub yourself raw.  Hmm.  Well, I have a totally... 
[01:06:30]  Now.  Because the towel isn't very soft.  He's not commenting on it, it seems.  Yeah.  I bet that would...  Towel, I guess.  Oh, my God.  It must feel great on the towel.  This guy is the worst.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Wow.  I love this guy. 
[01:07:00]  Is your little guy...  Or...  I can't...  Throwing.  Hmm.  So, you gotta...  One now?  Not that fast.  Hey.  So, you have a fetish.  I spelled it F-E-T-I-C-H because I'm a dumb boy.  Hey, what?  Fetish.  I cracked my spelling.  I like...  I like Steam Room. 
[01:07:30]  What's yours?  It's kind of weird.  Oh, my line?  Yeah.  I'm as f*** as a f***.  So, tell me when yours reaches f***.  I have a cast fetish.  Well, tell me.  Cast?  Yeah, like... 
[01:08:00]  Plastic cast.  Okay, so...  What happens?  How does this turn you in?  He doesn't even have the right terminology.  Oh, yes, he does.  Turn you in.  Oh, okay.  Turn you in.  How does this turn you in?  Well, if that wasn't his subconscious talking...  How does this guarantee you won't get to heaven?  Wait a minute.  I don't know.  It just does.  I've never had one.  But people that have them turn me on. 
[01:08:30]  And if I had one, it would probably turn me on.  Beats me.  It's kind of weird.  But along with that, I like the whole Catholic girl look.  That's our school uniform.  Ha, that's wild.  Yeah, but now, um...  Me too.  Cast got you going?  What are you wearing?  Normal clothes?  T-shirt and shorts?  Mmm.  So...  A big f***? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Um, love to slip them off you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And grab that f*** snake.  Grab!  But he's all freaked out.  He wrote, uh, Gram.  Yeah, G-R-E-M.  And grab that f*** snake.  And then real quick.  Grab!  I meant grab!  I don't want to grab it.  I don't want to wear it. 
[01:09:30]  Not tonight.  I want my Grammy to come over.  He can't find the keys at this point.  Yeah, I said the number of B.  Damn it, wipe my hands off.  He's so worked up.  He's really going to froth this guy.  All right, grab.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Not tonight.  Don't get too excited.  Well, you're...  That is true.  And I'm a little horny.  And also true.  Jesus.  I'm not going to read the line, but he's asking him to get a ruler. 
[01:10:00]  And I don't think it's to measure, to make sure it's an 8x10 legal pad for the next day's work.  I've already told you that.  Tell me again.  Seven and a half.  Oh.  This guy wrote more M's than I can count after that U. 
[01:10:30]  He must have just fallen nose first onto the keyboard, onto the M board.  Onto the M-T.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  Beautiful.  LOL.  That's a great size.  Thank you.  Still.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  You can say...  Well...  Blank... 
[01:11:00]  Oh, you can say word, word, blank, I think.  No?  It out.  Oh, I went the other way.  Too late now.  Too late now.  All right.  BRB, my mom is yelling.  Okay.  And that was at 8.11.  Yes, it says, okay, he has to sit there now until...  For three minutes.  H-14 in two seconds.  He said that for three minutes.  Just destroying his keyboard.  Back. 
[01:11:30]  Cool.  Hope she didn't see anything.  See, already, he knows.  Yeah.  This is wrong.  No, no.  She's computer dumb, though.  Makes me so mad.  Good.  Ha-ha.  Why?  Because she can't do anything.  Oh, well.  She couldn't figure out how to download a file from an email and open it.  Ha-ha.  And she only does it like a million times a day.  Oh, oh, that's you.  I'm ready to just...  Whatever.  Well, I better go finish my homework.  I just found out from a friend I have to finish reading and notating a book from AP English. 
[01:12:00]  And that's when Math 54 signs off.  Not even a goodbye.  No.  He just knows it's done.  It's done.  There's no more hotness to be had.  So, he signs off more than a minute later.  Or he had to do what he had to do.  Yeah.  Two things happened there.  He had to do what he had to do or he just was bored with the conversation.  Yeah.  Well, the kid's going.  The saucy typing was done.  No reason to stay online.  Well, you can see the page was just indulging him because, you know, I already told you that. 
[01:12:30]  Like, the page didn't want to be involved with this.  He just didn't want to, you know.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  He's kind of like...  I think he's putting up with it more than really getting into it.  Yeah.  To keep his job or maybe advance his career or something.  I'd love to see that first conversation.  God, I hope they release that.  Oh.  First time there's ruler talk.  And there's got to be more.  Oh, yeah.  There's got to be more.  Very good.  There you go.  Good job, guys.  Very good job.  What's an 8x10 legal pad?  Oh, why?  There's not an 8x10 legal pad? 
[01:13:00]  Jeff?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Could you enlighten me on legal pads, please?  8.5 by 14, man.  8.5 by 14.  How tall are you, dude?  Yes.  I'm 6'3".  Okay, so we don't know what size a legal pad is, but we know what side a douche is.  What side a douche?  What side I know.  I said it.  That's okay.  You can still have to spit out.  No, it was good.  All right, let's get a Paul in New Hampshire.  Paul.  Good intent was there.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  This is some of the sickest shit I've ever heard, dude.  They need to throw this skinner in prison. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, it's pretty...  Paul thinks it's creepy.  Yeah, it's pretty creepy-esque.  Yeah.  Andy in Detroit, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Just want to let you know, I've been hearing a lot about you.  I've got family back in New York, and in Detroit right now, your base is starting to grow slowly  but steadily, man.  I'm trying to help you out, too.  Thank you.  You got the virus in Detroit.  Thank you, Detroit.  Could you get a ruler?  Yeah, get a ruler.  I have a question for you.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone is saying that would have been better on XM.  I don't think so. 
[01:14:00]  Sometimes working around the rules is a lot funnier.  Yeah.  Actually, and even if it would have been better to...  There really wasn't anything you missed that was that graphic, to be honest with you.  It was a few things that they dump out of because they're babies, but there's nothing  hardcore in there that would have been like, my God, I can't believe...  You know, you don't understand it all.  I think we were bleeping out more radio corporation policy than FCC.  And I'd love to see...  I would love to see the FCC...  I would love to be able to do this experiment, read this goddamn transcript verbatim on the 
[01:14:30]  air, and then have the FCC give us a fine for reading it while the guy that wrote the  goddamn thing was working for the government.  This guy was working for the friggin' government.  And he was writing this stuff.  And let's see what kind of fine he gets or what kind of legal problems he runs into  when, meanwhile, we can't even read this stuff.  Oh, he's in trouble.  We'll see what kind of legal problems he gets into, though.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue.  It's a show.  It's our show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  It's Jimmy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  By the way, the football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all. 
[01:15:30]  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  I hope you know the deal by now.  Every week, the staff behind the scenes picking five games.  And I'm in on it as a goof.  A goof.  And I had that guy that wrote, bringing down Vegas.  Yep.  Bringing down the house, I mean.  Yeah.  We interviewed him on Friday.  He did my football picks this week.  And he did all right.  Three out of five.  Three out of five.  All right.  I am now in second place behind Steve. 
[01:16:00]  Steve.  Steve has 12 right for the season.  I have 11 right for the season.  $10,000 up for grabs.  Courtesy of Dish Network.  If I win, I will throw $10,000 out of a helicopter somewhere.  I'm thinking Pittsburgh.  I'm thinking Pittsburgh.  Wow.  We have like targets.  It's like a primary target where the cash bombing will take place.  You're thinking Pittsburgh?  Or we'll figure out a cool way to do it with all the cities.  I don't know.  But I'm thinking Pittsburgh personally. 
[01:16:30]  Jimmy just got back there.  He had a great, great time at the improv.  The reviews and the feedback from you going to Pittsburgh.  Just unbelievable.  Thank you.  I'm going to respond this week.  So another affiliate.  We'll see how that goes.  Oh, cool.  It sounds like Pittsburgh really is digging the Opie and Anthony show.  Unbelievable, the response from people.  Very, very cool.  We have time for Line of the Month.  Line of the Month.  Line of the Month.  This is brand new.  Yeah, brand new feature.  Over at XM, we do Line of the Day.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  So we figure we'll bring some of that over here by doing Line of the Month.  We got the top ten lines of the month of September.  Hard to do Line of the Day here because, you know, we're not done.  Right, right.  When we leave here.  Right.  Well, now that it's October.  Yeah.  We could do Lines of the Month.  You might call it October, Opie.  I like to call it Rocktober.  I kind of made it up.  I'm hoping it catches on.  Rocktober.  You think?  There's no way they're doing Rocktober out there still. 
[01:17:30]  I'm sure.  Are they?  Stop it.  Are they doing Rocktober still?  Someone right now probably in New York is doing it.  I'm sure every city.  I'm sure stations we're on are probably doing Rocktober.  Are we on a station that does Rocktober?  I wouldn't doubt it.  Which one do you think?  The Wolf?  I'm thinking New London.  You think?  I'm thinking New London does Rocktober.  All right.  Okay.  Which one do you think?  That's probably a good call.  That's probably a good call.  What's the classic rock station we're on? 
[01:18:00]  We're on a few.  Why?  Yeah.  Okay.  I would think a lot of the classic rock stations do it.  Well, we got Tattletales out there.  Obviously, we're on a few.  Nothing specific.  We're on a couple.  You know that one.  I like to make...  K-Rock in Pittsburgh is a rock station.  I wonder if we're on...  They actually have a great playlist.  I like to make believe I'm all-knowing, but you really...  It really called me out on that one.  I'm like...  Yeah, you should have seen his...  People, you should have seen his face when I asked him that question.  Because I know every once in a while it's pretty impressive when you go, oh, the Wolf  in New London.  Yeah.  How do they know that? 
[01:18:30]  They knew that.  But then you went a little too far with that.  How many classic rock stations?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Hopefully one.  All right.  You ready for the lines of the month?  And then we'll deem one line of the month officially, right?  Yes.  All right.  So, Than put this together.  We need some setups on this?  A couple of them.  This one doesn't really need a setup.  It's Jim talking to a female caller.  All right.  One of the great lines of the month of September.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Stop being a dick. 
[01:19:00]  Go...  Good thinking.  Go take some...  There you go, broad.  I don't even know...  Nice try.  Really slows you down mentally, doesn't it?  Yeah.  That one's from XM.  Of course it is.  Why is that a great one, though?  It was a great one without the beef.  I know our Jimmy is great.  Yeah.  Maybe the beef's screwing up.  He was saying a certain part of her anatomy, in the worst term you could possibly use for  that part of an anatomy of a woman, it's usually the one that stops every argument cold. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, okay.  That's where the setup needs to be.  It was interrupting with her thinking.  Having something really slows you down mentally, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just say it was an ankle.  Like saying having an ankle really slows you down mentally.  All right.  Now that's really funny.  Now I wait for the first dummy to call in.  How is that funny to have an ankle slowing you down?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What about the next one?  This one's pretty straightforward, making fun of Sam.  Sam, I love you, but your hair at that length is disturbing.  You look like asparagus. 
[01:20:00]  It really annoys me.  One of the great lines of September.  That is good.  The next one needs a setup?  Yes.  This is when we're talking about Karen Meyers' The Burn Victim Story.  Karen Meyers is the deaf reporter in Chicago.  Yeah, and they're commenting on the story about the burn victim.  Okay.  She did a whole story on, yeah, interviewed a burn victim.  That's how they make you feel better about your ailment is they send her over and you're  like, all right, well, I may always look surprised and I may have no lashes and I winch when I see 
[01:20:30]  vinegar, but at least I don't sound like this idiot.  Jimmy's running away with that idea.  No, but all the lead-ups means I'm not going to get one of the top prizes.  You can't.  You're not going to get a ribbon?  I want a ribbon!  Or a little trophy.  Jimmy running away with a nomination.  Right.  We should do, like, Employee of the Month type thing.  Yeah.  Get a little plaque.  You have me in a little faggoty McDonald's hat, smiling.  Or perhaps a Burger King crown. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Next one needs a setup?  Employee of the Month.  Yes.  This is when listening to Jim McGreevy on Oprah.  All right.  Say you're going out for the night.  God bless you, sweetie.  Pick up your lover and bring him back as some type of business associate, and you need  to do some work privately in the governor's office.  And you eat his s**t on your desk.  Right on the blotter. 
[01:21:30]  And you spread his dirty, oniony s**t, and you bury your gubernatorial face in him.  Jimmy's running away with this.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm getting all shy.  Gubernatorial face.  The bleeps are wrecking this bit, I'll be honest.  Didn't wreck the last bit, but it's wrecking this one a little bit.  Well, I have a way to amend it, but.  All right.  The next one?  Self-explanatory.  They are a mess.  Look at him.  He thinks he's in Clockworth Orange right now. 
[01:22:00]  Of course, Rich Voss, one of the great lines of September from when he was doing comedy  in that diner in Cleveland.  And he didn't realize that Clockworth Orange, this is how stupid Voss is.  He thought it was just a great line that was being recognized as such.  He didn't realize that everyone was laughing at an almost 50-year-old man who didn't know  Clockworth was wrong.  Yeah.  He was so happy that he was getting a big laugh there.  Didn't know it was Clockwork Orange.  Didn't realize they were laughing at him and not with him.  I was just going to say that's exactly what Voss' motto is.  And another great video on YouTube, by the way.  Voss doing his comedy in that diner in Cleveland. 
[01:22:30]  Check it out for yourself.  Let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey.  Is that Stephen King, by the way?  No.  What's that?  That's Bob Seger.  Oh.  Bob Seger has an album out.  First one in many, many years.  Go ahead, Mike.  I just want to let you guys know that you guys are awesome and that the wolf down here  in New London, Connecticut does not do anything like Rocktober or anything like that.  All right.  No Rocktober.  I'm very relieved that the wolf is not doing Rocktober.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike. 
[01:23:00]  You're welcome.  Punch it out.  What number are we up to?  Six.  Six.  Wow.  This is with Big Rhonda in studio.  Okay.  She's a fat person.  Very big fat person.  All right.  She's a contestant in the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  Not the leader.  The leader still, Crystal from Cleveland, 430 pounds.  You got to beat that.  And we're waiting for the next Fatty Pig Fatty to walk through that door.  How'd you get that?  Lifted up a bureau.  Oh, this is the...  You need to set this up better.  This is Big Rhonda and she's got a hernia sticking out of her belly button the size of 
[01:23:30]  a half a golf ball.  It's huge.  Disgusting.  How'd you get that?  Lifted up a bureau.  A bureau.  Yeah, I'm strong.  With the FBI?  Very good.  Jimmy's running away with that.  Very clever, Jimmy.  There's got to be other ones.  The Bureau of Investigation.  We're running out.  All right.  Next one.  I think this is pretty self-explanatory. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  What exactly did they say to you?  Um, the first thing...  Oh, I'm sorry.  It isn't...  I had like a...  Oh, oh, oh.  Wrong track.  I'm just seeing who's laughing at you.  Look around.  Travis.  Everybody's laughing at you.  He rocks getting a chuckle.  Travis laughing a little bit.  Okay.  Stay in the booth.  Um, this is with, uh...  The weird intern that switched over to Ron and Fez.  Frankenberry.  All right, Travis.  Would it make you more comfortable in that booth if we drilled a little hole so you can 
[01:24:30]  peek your head through?  You know.  Quick your finger through it.  Sorry.  Uh, yeah, this is the intern that went over to Ron and Fez on Ron and Fez talking about  why he, uh, you know, what his problem with the show was.  And he...  Jim had noticed when he was on O&A that he had a weird, uh, acne scar.  I didn't know it was an acne scar, actually.  I just knew he had like a lump in the middle of his head.  And I had...  How do you not mention it?  It was just there.  I really didn't know what it was. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  What exactly did they say to you?  Um, the first thing...  I had this, uh...  I had like a scar on my head.  It was a scab in my head.  And that was the first thing they mentioned.  They asked what it was.  Yeah, why bring that up, Ron?  I know.  It was just very personal.  It was like a f***ing minor's life.  How did we not mention it?  It's like...  It's like...  We were playing back the audio.  And then Jimmy commented.  Yeah.  How come it's me, though?  It's embarrassing me.  What about...  You are every nomination. 
[01:25:30]  You just happened to win a lot of the lines of the day.  You are every nomination.  What about Ant?  What about me?  Yeah.  There were plenty of runners-up on a day that covered everybody, but Jim happened to be  the line of the day.  Wow.  All right.  A lot of the time.  Here's the next one.  Yeah.  You can just go.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's up?  Hey, I have a solution for Jimmy's s*** problem.  What, madam?  It's called Magic Shaving Powder.  Have you ever heard of it?  No.  What is it?  It's actually made for black men's faces. 
[01:26:00]  It's like a depilatory cream.  What's in it?  Mace?  What?  Finally.  Oh, nothing.  All right.  There's Ant's first one.  I'm in the mix.  That was beautiful.  You're in the mix.  That was about shaving down below, and she was giving you a little pointer with this product.  About ingrown hairs and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Black guys always get that on their necks.  Where are we up to there, Than?  This is when we were talking to the caller that called in whose cousin had blown their 
[01:26:30]  head off.  Right.  Oh, look at Ope's face.  I would have loved to have gone to that wake.  You got the coffin, and then a whole hat box to the left.  That is a funny line.  A little hat box.  Runner-up line of the month.  Yeah.  Because these are in order.  Are they not in order? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yes.  No, they're not.  I know you didn't make any order.  Is this the one?  This is the big winner.  This is when we had guitarist Gary Hoey in.  Gary Hoey.  Okay.  And everybody was trying to brainstorm for a name for the Fatty Pig Fatty contest before  we had the name.  Okay.  Yes, Gary?  What about Fat Pigs for Fat Cash?  No.  No.  Too long.  Too wordy?  Too long?  Not mean enough?  This is too long.  How about I try to play the guitar?  How's that?  Straight up. 
[01:27:30]  Let me try to play the guitar and...  Does anybody remember laughing?  Yeah, that was really a great insult.  A great cringe moment.  I was like, ah.  Yeah.  We're all thinking the same thing.  Just shut up.  Yeah.  He's a guitarist trying to be funny.  So, well, I turned it around on him.  Spun it around.  Boy, that was exciting.  How did Ant only get one nomination?  That doesn't make sense.  I don't know.  I'm just going to have to go to my A game and have to work a little harder. 
[01:28:00]  I think the bin needs a little more work because, I mean, how does that happen there,  Than?  Yeah.  I mean, granted, I find out...  The guys don't like him?  Guys just don't like Ant behind the scenes?  Why don't they like Anthony?  Yeah, I think...  Why don't you look at Anthony and explain why he only had one.  I'll give you a line...  For a whole month.  That should have been in there.  I'll give you a line that should have been in there.  All right.  The diaper line.  Oh, my God.  How did that...  One of my personal favorite lines I've ever said. 
[01:28:30]  Which one is the diaper line?  Oh, it was...  But the Angelina Jolene...  Oh, my God.  That should have been in there.  Hmm.  With the diaper.  Don't remember that one, do you?  I agree.  I didn't think...  The system's being refined.  This is the first time.  The system's being refined.  Let me ask you, and as we were leading up, when you were hearing that one, were you thinking  that might be the winner?  I was thinking it had to be in there.  It had to be in there.  Yeah.  Not the...  Actually, I want to give it to the winner, but I'm thinking it had to be in there.  That was a good one.  This bit is flawed.  We got to work on it.  We got to bring this one back to the Opie and Anthony lab.  We brought it out too soon. 
[01:29:00]  We need the top 10.  We have to do number 10 for the month, number 9, all the way to number 1.  Got to make sure you pay attention and throw a few of Anthony's in there.  Yes.  This was the rough draft that needed to work.  I apologize.  Well, you have to start marking now the way you do for bombs and flubs.  You have to start marking for possible...  You know, you just got to do it as it goes along and start marking for possible line of  during the month.  Well, we started this in the middle of the month too, so...  All right.  All that explains it. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  New month, new contest.  Thanks, Dan.  Sure.  We try things on the show.  We'll make that one better for next month.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:30:00]  Aren't we supposed to be giving away MacBooks today?  What is it, one a day?  Ah, I hold in my hand.  Ah.  The first winner of the MacBook contest.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that in a few minutes, okay?  Also, during break, Anthony was talking about, what, staying in the city?  Yeah, stay in the city.  Saw Stephen Lynch's show.  Wedding Singer. 
[01:30:30]  Wedding Singer.  It's good, right?  Very funny, man.  Yeah.  I highly recommend it.  Very, very funny.  Great hysterical 80s references, man.  Good job, too.  Stephen did a great job.  And they like playing poker?  Yeah.  Right after the show's over?  Yeah, you always think, like, you think that anything is different than your job, whatever  it is you're doing.  When you go somewhere to work, you realize, like, oh, my God, there's a bunch of screw-ups  and everything.  How does this job even get done?  How is this company working?  And you think Broadway is different, or whatever job you get into, you think, like, I thought 
[01:31:00]  radio was different, but it's not.  It's just a bunch of screw-ups getting together and hanging on by their fingernails, hoping  things work out.  And, like, Broadway, you go to a Broadway show, our buddy Stephen's in it, and then after  the show, he goes, you know, come backstage.  The show is over.  It's, like, five minutes over, and I'm thinking, you know, oh, it must be a big to-do, and they're  talking to each other and taking off makeup and doing things like you expect, like, backstage 
[01:31:30]  Broadway, going over the show, maybe something they want to do tomorrow.  Within minutes, him and his buddy's just back there playing poker.  He's got this giant poker table that takes up his entire dressing room and just sits  back there playing poker.  Doing nothing, just, hey, man, what's up?  Well, it's got to be boring, though.  They do the same exact thing every day.  I would gather.  Can you imagine doing the same radio show every day, how easy that would be?  Done it some days.  Not to take away from these guys, because they're performers and stuff, and there's a lot of 
[01:32:00]  shows on Broadway that fail miserably, but when you have a hit, then you're just doing  the same exact thing every single day.  Every day.  It's got to be monotonous.  Very monotonous.  Actually, we talked to Lynch about The Wedding Singer, and he kind of was hinting that he  can't wait for it to end.  It's just like, he's enjoying it, he loves doing it, loves the opportunity, but, man.  And that was like four or five months ago when I think he was up to 100 shows already.  Yeah.  He's got to, he must have done another 100 since then, so he's, he's, oh, I imagine he wants  to move on.  He does, you know, it's a show every day of the week. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And two on, I think, Sunday or Wednesday, one of those days.  Wednesday's matinee day.  Wednesday's matinee day.  Yeah.  And, oh.  I know that from my commute in.  The grind.  From Long Island on the train.  Oh, is that it?  With all the housewife Bettys getting all made up for their day in the city, which diner  they were going to eat at for lunch, and what show they were going to see.  Ugh.  So that was great.  We saw Jackass, the movie. 
[01:33:00]  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  Loved it.  Better than the first?  I thought it was better than the first.  It's hysterical.  These guys are just, they're out of control.  They pull a lot of surprise pranks on each other, which is funny.  Just violent.  Them just beating on each other.  And really disgusting.  Vomit.  A lot of bodily fluid humor, which I don't know why.  Throwing up grosses me out, but when other people are doing it, it's hysterical.  Always funny.  Yeah.  And to see Steve-O doing it in what is almost like a diver's helmet. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, really?  The deep sea diver helmet?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  But it wasn't hooked up to oxygen.  All right.  It was hooked up to a funnel.  Yeah.  And then hooked up to a gentleman.  No kidding.  Who may have eaten certain things that, yeah.  Oh, so he wasn't doing the puking.  No, Steve-O was puking.  After he, all right, I get you.  Yeah.  There was, it wasn't pure air going into the helmet.  Right.  So it made Steve-O vomit into the helmet. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And just, I don't know why, I'm laughing.  Hilarious.  We were laughing so hard, our stomachs hurt, you couldn't breathe.  It's just really, really, it was a funny movie.  And then the movies change at the hotels on the first of the month.  And you're all about room service.  Oh, I love the room service and movies.  And movies, yep.  So the movies change and new releases and things that are still in theaters.  So we saw Snakes on the Plane. 
[01:34:30]  Snakes on a Plane.  Could be the worst movie ever.  Could be the worst movie ever.  Samuel L. Jackson should have his fame revoked.  Should not be allowed to be famous anymore.  It was awful.  The story was ridiculous.  The snakes looked horrible.  It was these cheap looking CGI snakes.  And it was like supposed to be some kind of, you know, the old disaster movies where they 
[01:35:00]  set up the characters, put them in an environment and then have the disaster.  Yeah.  And then you know the people.  You just don't, you don't care about one person.  How long until the movie before they saw the snakes?  Um, I don't know, 40, 40 minutes, I guess.  40 minutes?  To wait to see a snake?  Yeah, because they had to get the setup of how, uh, why there were snakes on the plane.  And it was one of those situations where you're like, I was watching this just going, this  is awful. 
[01:35:30]  It's just a horrible movie.  And you were telling me that they're getting bit on every body part of Mashable?  Yeah, they had to get bit on every body part.  Like, there are a couple trying to join the Mile High Club.  And it comes through the smoke detector that they disabled and, uh, gets the, the couple  that are having sex in the bathroom.  And then a guy goes in to use the bathroom and the snake jumps out of the toilet and grabs  him, uh, of course, right by the junk.  And then, uh, like every provocative part of a human's body had to get bit by the snakes. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Like, uh, uh, one of the, uh, big, uh, fat, uh, black guys got his butt bit and then they  go through the old joke about, uh, sucking the venom out.  And it just was like, it's like, that, that's an old joke.  That sounds like such a good movie too.  Like, you know, you figure like a plane with snakes on it.  I mean, how do you miss?  So what's weird about your sarcasm, Jimmy, what's weird about Anthony?  I don't, I already know the answer to this question.  You saw the whole movie, right?  Of course.  Yeah, man.  When I start seeing a bad movie, I can't, I can't.  I tap out. 
[01:36:30]  I always tap out and say, you know what?  Let's try something else.  Like I thought they were going for a, um, for a goof movie after a little while.  And then I realized, oh my God, no, they're not.  They, they really are trying to make this serious.  And the mile high club.  Yeah.  They're yelling and screaming in the bathroom.  Yeah.  They're yelling, screaming, and the door is being pounded on and you're here because they're  being attacked by snakes.  But they're, so they're both screaming in agony.  And a couple of the flight attendants are like, got another couple in the bathroom.  And like, maybe, you know, before nine 11, you could almost believe something like that. 
[01:37:00]  But now they'd be, forget about it.  They would be knocking down the door.  The air marshals at the door.  Amber.  Everything was ridiculous.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Worst movie ever seen.  Yeah, what was it?  Snakes on a plane?  Worst movie I've ever seen?  Yeah.  Crossroads?  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  Which one was Crossroads?  It was the old one with, um.  You know what?  You know what I didn't understand?  Oh, with Britney Spears.  That one?  No.  I was going back.  Yeah.  That one sounds pretty bad.  No, the one with, uh, what's his name?  Ralph Lodge?  No, the other one. 
[01:37:30]  What?  How about, uh, any, any film that is, that's named that?  Yeah, any film named Crossroads stinks.  All right, that's a good call.  I'll agree with that.  That's a good call.  Why not?  I can't remember his guy there.  See Thomas Howell.  Wasn't he in that?  I don't know.  Crossroads.  It's not the Britney Spears one, though, she's saying.  Back in, uh, 1986, it's probably that one.  Now I'm curious here.  Uh.  Don't be.  Why bother?  We're talking about horror films, which is kind of like the lead into the movie Urine,  which, the original was one of the creepiest films I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:38:00]  Did you on?  Or you mean The Grudge?  The Grudge.  The Grudge.  Of course.  The Grudge was, uh, yeah, really scary.  And then I was, I saw Jackass this weekend, so your trailer was playing, and I.  Yeah, somebody told me that.  I had to like, I had to keep my head down.  I can't watch the, it's too goddamn scary.  It, it gives me nightmares.  That little kid, I want to choke him.  He's a creepy little boy.  And I bet he's just adorable without the makeup.  The first time I ever met the Kayako girl, well, when I was on set, she was like a huge 
[01:38:30]  fan of, um, the actress is a huge fan of Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  So, there in Japan, it's called, um, 16.  So, she just came, she came up to me, I guess somebody told me that she wanted me to sign  her book.  They had like a Japanese book that was like, for schoolgirls, it was all about that movie,  like the characters.  And so, she came up to me with the book to sign it, and she was like in full Kayako makeup  with the wig on and everything.  She was like, sign my book.  She was so excited, and her eyes were all wide and black.  Just run away.  The hair was all, the full makeup, and these ghost hands, and I'm like, this is really creepy. 
[01:39:00]  What does Kayako mean?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Like, what, like the little boy.  And you said, Kayako's the girl, the ghost, that like, crawls down the stairs.  You see her in the first film.  Yeah, in that creepy way.  The little boy is Toshio.  Is he in this one?  Yeah, he's in this one.  So, you met him too?  Yeah.  Was he a friendly little fella in real life?  He was.  That friendly little fella.  They put him in like a little white diaper, and he would run around in like blue, white,  like white makeup, and you couldn't touch him because it would like come off on you. 
[01:39:30]  Why would you want to?  Horrifying little creep.  Well, that guy grabbed his arm one time, and it was like all blue, white makeup.  I got to tell you, horror movies were starting to get really, really hacky, where they weren't  believable anymore.  Like, whatever.  And then the grudge just brought her right back to scaring the crap out of you.  Well, you were also in the ring.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Another beginning of the ring.  You were in the ring?  Yeah.  Well, who were you in the ring?  I don't remember.  Alex Walsh.  That's the beginning?  I played Naomi Watts' cousin in the beginning.  The girl that died was in the closet.  Yeah.  You're the one? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  That's you who died in the closet with the mouth open?  It is, boo.  When they say, I saw her face, and then they switched to it.  I was, me and my girlfriend was screaming in the movie theater like idiots, and both of  us had tears in our eyes going, why did we come to see this?  Do you know what?  It's the scariest goddamn scene.  That scared me because that's not how, like, when Gore Verbinski shot it, that's not how  he shot it.  There was a whole scene where they're in my bedroom, and he shot it so that the mother 
[01:40:30]  is saying, like, to Naomi, she's like, I saw her face, and then she goes and redoes it  and opens the closet, and she's like, she was sitting right there, and she points, and  the camera, like, pans, and then there's the body.  So that's how they shot it, because I was there when they shot it, and then when it was  in the movie theater, it was just, like, this, like, snapshot, like, really quick of  the body, and they get trauma.  I was sitting next to Andy Dick at the premiere, I'll never forget that, and he would scream,  like, he ruined the movie for me.  Every five minutes, he was screaming like a little girl, and he kept grabbing my leg, 
[01:41:00]  so.  That was you, who, with the mouth open in the closet?  Yes.  That was horrifying.  Totally.  That was horrifying.  This distorted face.  Whoa.  Like, the TV kept going out, and that was you walking around, you're like, oh, the TV's  off.  She's with her friend in the...  Rotten kid crawled out of the...  The rotten kid.  That movie gave...  I saw that before The Grudge.  It was out before The Grudge.  That movie gave me the creeps.  That really bothered me, that movie.  I had to walk around the apartment.  That movie really bothered me.  Yeah.  It's that whole bringing over the Japanese movies and redoing them here. 
[01:41:30]  Man, the Japanese horror films are messed up.  They're, like...  They're good, though, because...  I don't know.  I get really bored with things where you're, like, torturing people, and there's not, like,  a reason behind it.  I think it just gets a little played and tired for me, so the Japanese horror films, though,  even if you see some of the originals of those things...  Yeah.  Ooh, they're really, really scary.  Anything to do with ghosts, like, kind of freaks me out.  Yeah, it's all, like, paranormal stuff.  Yeah, like, we're used to seeing every day on the news, like, oh, somebody got murdered. 
[01:42:00]  Like, that is just typical, like, news for us here, so to have something completely  different, like ghosts, anything to do with the supernatural, to me, is, like, awesome.  And there's something about what they're doing, able to do with technology today, where they  can just distort a body...  Okay, but here's what you gotta know.  ...that makes it so goddamn creepy.  Here's what you gotta know about The Grudge.  Shamiza-san, who's the director, and Sam Raimi both have...  Sam Raimi produced the film, but Shamiza-san specifically really doesn't like CGI. 
[01:42:30]  So, so much of the time was spent creating these, like, terrifying montage scenes, but it  was with, really with actors.  Like, he tries to do it in a way so that they're really there.  Like, the scene...  Remember in the trailer in the first movie, when Sarah Michelle Gellar's taking a shower  and you see the hands come out of her hair?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  That was real.  They had, they had the actress standing in front of her, and, like, the perfect timing  was that the camera moved so that you didn't see her there, that her hands could come  out of Sarah's hair.  So that, to me, like, is even more creepy, because while I was doing the scenes, it wasn't 
[01:43:00]  against, like, a, you know, a blue screen or something.  You're, like, you're actually there, and you're with him trying to figure out the best possible  scare, the best way to do it, but to have everyone there in live action.  Sometimes you get distracted, too, where you're looking at CGI and you go, hey, well, it doesn't  look that good.  And the girl who's the, who is the ghost, the one who comes down the stairs, who's  always, like, making those weird movements, is a contortionist.  She used to work in a circus in Japan.  See?  So she, like, works, she moves so weird.  It was so strange to watch her.  And it's weird with the speed of the film and how they screw with that and make it choppy, 
[01:43:30]  and that just, see?  Look, goosebumps.  There's a scene in The Exorcist.  I hate that.  Ooh, it's so scary.  Which got cut.  It never made the final film, because it felt there was, like, a double climax in the scene.  Right.  Really?  Where Linda Blair runs down the steps.  Oh, backwards.  Backwards with her head twisted.  I saw it.  I saw the, um, they re-released it.  I saw it at the Grauman's Chinese in L.A.  Yeah.  I had no idea.  That was terrifying.  She goes backwards.  One of the sickest scenes in the movie.  Yeah, it is.  And it was cut out. 
[01:44:00]  Why did they cut it out?  It double climaxed in the scene or something.  It just didn't work for the director at the time?  Well, right after.  Yeah.  Is that, like, right when she pees on the floor?  It was either when she, um, it might be when she said, you're all gonna die up there,  and she lets go on the floor.  Yeah.  It was either that.  I think it is.  They felt it just double climaxed.  It didn't work in the scene or whatever.  Yeah.  Like, it was too much.  Yeah, like, it was too much.  By the way, but The Exorcist, I ruined something for myself this weekend.  You know in The Exorcist, there's a really horrifying white face that flashes.  Yeah.  It's known as The Face, and it happens when Damien Karras is having the dream about his 
[01:44:30]  mother.  Yeah.  It happens a few times.  It's just a white face, and it flashes, and it's gone, and it's terrifying.  I just saw a picture of the real person who's behind that makeup, and it's a girl.  Really?  That devil face was a girl.  Ruined it for you?  It wrecked it for me, because she's all normal looking now, and I'm like, that's the person?  Oh, it was awful.  I forget her name.  Look up The Exorcist, The Face, and then under Images, and it will direct you to her  website.  I wish I could remember her name.  That's a dope credit to have them. 
[01:45:00]  Really?  That's pretty cool.  I was that, like, creepy face.  I was there for a second.  There are things that scare me in movies, and it's never, like, slasher movies have  never scared me at all.  It doesn't do it for me.  Things like that.  Those goddamn twins in The Shining.  In The Shining, right?  Yeah.  Always, when they just, boop, they pop out of nowhere like that.  Dumb, done.  Done.  Because that's the stuff that you don't want to see, like, when you're sleeping, and  you open your eyes, like, a foot away from your face.  Like, you get those, and friends, like, I'm going to have these nightmares now that these 
[01:45:30]  little kid, creepy kids are in the room.  Kids, there's a scene, I think it's in the original garage.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was the woman, right?  That was the girl.  Who was the one that died in the bed?  You know what I mean?  Like, there's a scene where she's, like, doing something in the house, and her husband  comes home, and he's looking for her.  He's like, ah, where are you?  And he walks up to the bedroom, and she's laying in the bed, and she is as horrified as  anybody has ever looked.  I think it's the owner of that house.  Yeah, I remember that.  And in the Juon films, which are the Japanese originals of that, they took a lot of that 
[01:46:00]  stuff in the first film.  It's scary.  There's, like, that scene where the girl's in the bed, and she's, like, running away from  Kayako, and, like, she ends up, like, looking under the covers, and Kayako's face is, like,  right there looking up at her.  To me, that was, like, one of the scariest scenes ever, because you're always, especially  as a little kid, and, like, placates on your worst fear, that you can hide, like, that's  the best place to hide, is under your covers, and, like, to not even be safe there.  I know the only person who'd be happy to lift up his covers and see, uh, Kayako would be 
[01:46:30]  Foley.  Nice fallback.  Do you, uh, do you chuckle a little bit at West Side Story?  Do you laugh a little bit?  Um, no, I don't, I chuckle at, like, remakes of the plays.  Yeah?  They're kind of, like, funny.  Yeah.  Like, L.A. plays, like, yeah.  Just to watch that.  Why was she laughing at West Side Story?  It is a little dramatic.  Yeah.  Why, were you in it?  Were you in, like, a newer version of it?  No, her dad.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I really know nothing about everybody. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, wow.  Cool.  Like, the star.  Like, the big star in it.  It's like dance fighting.  Dance fighting.  Gotta kind of laugh at that a little bit.  It's the first, like, dance movie, I guess.  Yeah, it's a classic.  I mean, I've never even seen it.  We haven't even really introduced her, by the way.  No, we haven't.  We kind of got excited about having her here and talking about...  Just in case they haven't.  And we met in the dressing room, or the green room, and she said that we've met before.  We've met before.  I'm 100% sure of it.  Really?  Yeah.  And you don't remember where? 
[01:47:30]  Mm-mm.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy needs to go where.  Huh?  I know for a fact.  Like, I'm just...  There's no doubt about it.  Do you know how much this bugs me?  No, but I don't know...  I'm wondering if she just...  I don't care.  ...might as she asked me to a set somewhere and not knowing it.  Like...  I don't care where, who, when, or what.  Whenever we have celebrities that come in here that know Jimmy...  Have you been at the Upright Citizens Brigade?  No.  A guy who works there asked me to actually do a set there.  But have you been there?  No, I don't think so.  You know she's going to remember as soon as she leaves us. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's going to drive you nuts, Jimmy.  And it won't be me.  I think you have your IM up.  I'm going to go home and start IMing you.  It won't be me.  It'll be some creep she saw on Dateline.  Like, oh, yeah, I thought that was you.  Sorry.  Hey, let's go to Josh in Florida.  You're a predator.  Real fast.  Josh, what's up?  Good morning.  I just wanted to know how in the world you three big men got all creeped out by stupid  episodes of that remake.  Because you're all manly, aren't you?  No movie gives you the creeps.  Stop it.  You're in the lower percentile, then, of people that don't get the heebie-jeebies. 
[01:48:30]  The vibe in those movies, in The Ring and The Grudge, there was a...  Maybe you're too stupid to pick up on it.  You dope.  God, the beginning scene of The Shining gets me going when they're driving up the mountain  with the music playing.  No, it's all vibe.  If it doesn't have a vibe, slasher movies don't have vibe.  It's a problem.  There's more intellect to it.  Yeah.  You're stupid, sir.  That's what it is.  Yes, you're a dope, and we despise you.  I didn't even hear what he said.  He was just saying, how come three manly men, which I agree with his assessment, could  get, like, frightened at horror movies?  It's like, stop it.  Of course it can.  If it didn't happen to the majority of people, the people wouldn't go see him. 
[01:49:00]  So what can you tell us about The Grudge 2?  What can I tell you about The Grudge 2?  Scary.  It's called The Grudge, and it's got the number two behind it.  Well, it's a comedy.  It's a coming-of-age story.  There are a few ghosts, and there are trials and tribulations.  I'm sure you're going to use the same formula.  It's going to be just as scary.  Horrifying.  Yeah.  You thought you shot in Japan, right?  Maybe some new tricks.  Yeah, we shot in Japan.  We were there for three months.  This film is interesting because it's the first one that is basically not Shamisa-san, 
[01:49:30]  the director, the one who created the Ju-on series, and shot the remake, which is The Grudge,  and this one as well, which is The Grudge 2.  This is not something that he wrote, so it's completely different than what anyone's ever  seen, whereas the first Grudge was a real, like, almost scene-by-scene take of the Ju-on,  the first Ju-on.  So this is something completely original, and they've really, it's interesting, they've  sort of broken it off into three different storylines that intersect at the end in three 
[01:50:00]  different, like, locations, sort of.  There is a huge reveal to this film, which is much different than, I think, what people  are expecting, like a bunch of, like, ghost tricks and stuff like that, but there's actually  a huge reveal that will end up probably going to the third Grudge, my guess is.  I would gather, yeah.  It's pretty, pretty scary, so I'd be interested to see people's reaction to it.  I'd be interested to have a little part in the third Grudge, who'd like to be a part  of it.  Oh, stop, wait till she remembers where she saw you.  Maybe we did an acting thing together. 
[01:50:30]  Bothers the hell out of me, because, like, Edward Norton, who I think is a fantastic actor,  we had him on the phone, and we go, yeah, we're here, me, Opie, and Jimmy Norton, and  he's like, oh, the comedian, Jim Norton, oh, yeah, I love you, I see you, and it just  bothered the hell out of me that he knew who the hell he was.  Just a couple of people with the similar last names who kind of act in a similar fashion.  Oh, yeah.  I'm very good.  Stop it.  All right, let's go to Don and New Mexico.  If he said he'd overact in part three, I'd be more than happy to show up and get the 
[01:51:00]  mode.  He'd be like, wow, what horrible, horrible, scared faces.  I'd be like, that was supposed to be dramatic and sexy.  Dramatic and sexy.  Don, what's up?  Hello, sir.  Don, let's go, New Mexico.  Speak, my friend.  Yeah, how's it going, man?  We went and watched Jackass 2 this weekend, and during the trailer for Grudge 2, there  was probably about 20 people around us.  As soon as it started, you know, all the creepy things with, you know, the hair and  the little kid and everything, everybody, I mean, had their hands over their faces and 
[01:51:30]  everything.  And then it was like, as soon as the trailer was done, you know, there's, you know, the  little hush whisper and everybody, everybody was sitting there saying, oh, man, I've got  to go watch that.  I think I'm going to wait until it comes out on DVD so I can fast-forward it through  the scary parts.  See?  Manly man.  What's the point of even watching it, then, if you're going to fast-forward through the  scary parts?  That's a good point.  What do you do when you're watching porn?  Just make sure you fast-forward to the story?  Hey, hammer can hammer us.  She's doing a knee slap over there, Jimmy.  That was genius, my friend. 
[01:52:00]  He's a genius.  The thing with those Grudge movies in the ring, I mean, they're the only two I can think  of that have like that, like you said, it's that choppy movement.  The color, too.  It has a specific color.  Yes.  It's like a green-blue, like.  Yeah.  For some reason, that just is creepy.  It looks just dank and hopeless.  Yeah.  You feel hopeless.  Like, I don't know why, but you just feel like you're lost and there's no connection to  what can make.  I don't know what it does.  It was the Grudge was the one where the girl is coming home, right, and that shadow keeps 
[01:52:30]  popping up on the security cam.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And she's trying to walk into her apartment and the creepy thing is following her.  You get the feeling that there's no Starbucks in the area.  Yes.  No place to go have a cup of coffee.  Just a cup of joe.  Maybe talk to the ghost.  Just a lot of desperation.  Mad in Jersey.  Never a happy ending in those movies.  Never.  That's the only time you pay to see an Asian and not get a happy ending.  Well, they, to me, most of the American stuff has taken a lot from overseas, like Tarantino 
[01:53:00]  and Mitchie took a lot of stuff from John Woo, a lot of the camera stuff, and it seems  like they're not married to the happy ending, or they're not married to the quote-unquote  Hollywood.  No.  They're usually just tragic, like, oh my God, it didn't end happy, did it?  Did you ever see The Vanishing with Kiefer Sutherland and it's one of Sandra Bullock's first  films where he's looking for Diane the whole movie, and at the end, you know, if you didn't  see it too bad, he's thrown in a coffin by Jeff Bridges, who's a complete creep in this.  Yeah, really good.  Hi, Barney.  This is great.  Yeah.  And, uh, but at the end, you know, his girlfriend breaks him out of the coffin, but in the original 
[01:53:30]  Vanishing, uh, Jeff, he realizes, like, he's trying to figure out what happened to his  girlfriend, and he wakes up in a coffin, uh, and he looks around, and the guy who put  him in the coffin is sitting in a lawn chair, just relaxing, knowing the fact that he's  in the coffin, and that's how it ends.  That's how it ends, yeah.  So you know he suffocates in the coffin.  There is no happy ending, but for the American version, they have to change it.  Of course they had to.  Let's go to Matt.  It was good to see seven.  What's that?  You know, seven was one of those that didn't have a happy ending.  Yeah, right, right.  What's in the box?  Matt in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys? 
[01:54:00]  Saw The Exorcist about a year ago, a 30-year-old guy.  Saw The Exorcist, the remake, with that spider walk.  Actually, my wife was out of town, saw that movie, had nightmares four nights in a row, actually  had to entice my seven-year-old nephew to come over to my house and stay with me with a brand  new video game, but enough to stay alone.  That thing was the creepiest thing I've ever seen.  The Exorcist is a horrifying film.  It's a horrifying movie.  They made a remake of it?  Maybe they did.  The re-release, where they put that scene.  Oh, the re-release.  Yeah, yeah.  The scene wasn't needed, though, because what they could do with graphics back, that was 
[01:54:30]  pretty impressive.  Like, the bed being re-released.  Oh, yeah.  They pulled off some amazing stuff.  It was freaking, I think.  Well, Vinny from the Bronx, you know, he knows.  He knows all.  Vinny.  Oh, go ahead, Vin.  You're on.  Oh, P. Anthony, how you guys doing?  It's really good to talk to you guys.  All right, Vinny.  Listen, I just got to tell you guys something.  I really don't understand, like, you know, where you guys are coming from with the scariness  of these movies.  Yeah.  I saw Bambi the other day, and it was, like, terrifying for me.  He saw what?  Bambi.  Yeah, Bambi.  I couldn't take it.  Vinny wants to say, if you really got scared at these movies, you're gay. 
[01:55:00]  Exactly.  Okay.  All right.  But then we got Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Why are we gay?  Because we get scared.  I don't know.  Dave.  Why are we homophobic?  Yeah, what is Vinny scared of, besides the Rico statue?  What's wrong with it?  Creep.  Stop calling this program.  I know.  Hey, yeah.  Dave, Jersey, what's up?  He's afraid to start his car in the morning.  Yeah, you guys are killing me, man.  It's a grown man.  You know, I'm flipping through the channels alone in the house one day, and I see The Omen  is on.  I'm like, oh, great.  The Omen, man. 
[01:55:30]  Good movie.  Let me check it out.  Yeah.  I lasted, like, about 45 seconds until that music started coming off from that movie.  And I'm like, okay, I don't think I really want to watch this no more, man.  Dude, you remember what was Creepy and The Omen?  You remember when the woman is like, Damien?  Damien?  When he's in the yard, and she hangs herself off the balcony, which was really a creepy,  fantastic moment.  Yep.  They didn't need to remake that one.  No, why would you?  The terror in the atmosphere of it.  Of the original is just amazing.  Part two was good, too, though, where the kid had the little 666, and he had the little  dilemma. 
[01:56:00]  You know, young, good-looking devil.  How do you not like that boy?  Let's go to Scott in Jacksonville.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  You know, the ones that have always messed with me are, like you say, like the shining stuff,  but the one I saw a couple weeks ago for the first time on time, Rosemary's Baby.  Oh, yeah.  About 18 minutes into it, any time you get, like, 80-year-old people plotting against you,  just scary as heck.  Whenever Ruth Gordon is a devil worshiper, how does that not terrify you?  Yeah, that's amazing.  You're among friends, Ricky.  You know, the building that is featured in that is the Dakota, where Lennon was shot. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, I didn't know that.  And I live in the area, and just walking by the Dakota because of Rosemary's Baby, it  just creeps you out, that building, to this day.  Oh, it's the Dakota?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Those are the movies.  Also, the Dakota, excuse me, was in Vanilla Sky.  Opening scene, Tom Cruise comes cruising out of the parking garage, takes a left and  takes a right on Central Park West.  But he lives in the Dakota in that movie as well.  Here's what makes Rosemary's Baby creepy, probably the same thing as it makes the grudge 
[01:57:00]  in the ring.  It's that helpless feeling you get when you watch it.  It's almost like anything that you think is normal can't help you.  Like, in Rosemary's Baby, it's her family and her friends who are hurting her.  Yeah, where's she going?  It's like, where can she go?  Where's she going?  There's nobody to turn to.  Also, the way that specifically that that film is shot, where they would have huge wide  shots of her, and they would show the room when she would come in and then smash  cut to a very, very tight shot of her face, and then follow her walking through the house.  So you have this sense of seeing the room and seeing where she is, the atmosphere, but 
[01:57:30]  then being stuck in a little box with her while you don't know what she's seeing or where  she's looking.  Yeah, around her.  Like, all the time.  I remember that specifically.  I didn't even notice that.  Creepy.  Hey, we've got to take a break.  You want to hang?  You want to go?  You busy?  It's up to you, Amber.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't know.  I feel like I have somewhere to go, but maybe I don't.  She's got people.  Well, we feel like this is going very well.  You want to hang?  But I don't want to leave.  You guys are fun.  We like you.  And you're funny.  I want to know where we met.  Probably on some, like, match.com. 
[01:58:00]  Well, we're going to take a break.  Amber might be here.  She might not be.  Amber Tamblyn, The Grudge 2 starts what?  October 13th.  Okay, so we got it.  Friday the 13th.  Oh, look at you.  Look at you.  It's got you.  It's got Sarah Michelle Gellar.  And everyone who's seen the trailer said it's horrifying.  Yeah, it is.  The trailer, yeah.  So scary.  We might lose Amber.  We're not sure, so.  Oh, we got to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Amber, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Just in case you do leave.  Okay.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:58:30]  That makes me laugh every time.  I know.  It's an official sponsor.  Now, I've seen it all in radio.  There's a deep-voiced guy here in New York.  The rest of the country is not hearing this, and the X-Amers are not hearing this.  Yeah.  The Fatty Pig Fatty contest is sponsored by Fatty Pig Fatty.  That is really, really funny.  Yeah, do we have that?  Can we play that really fast?  What do we do?  Fatty Pig Fatty is sponsored by H57, America's number one selling Hootia product. 
[01:59:00]  If it's not H57, it's not real South African Hootia.  Call 1-877-H57.com.  What the hell is Hootia?  I don't know, but it's funny to hear Fatty Pig Fatty mention.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  The same way like the Super Bowl is sponsored by.  Sponsored by.  By the way, where are the fatties?  Contest is in a lull right here.  The leader's 430 pounds.  All you have to do is get yourself to our studio if you're heavier than 430 pounds.  We're paying $10 a pound to the heaviest girl that comes into the studio. 
[01:59:30]  What are you, 440 pounds?  You're out there somewhere?  That's $4,400.  And you're just sitting there pretty much giving away $4,400 if you're the winner.  The same thing that makes people on the street point at you, laugh, and throw objects is  the same thing that makes us want you to come up into this studio.  See?  Right.  The people that are annoyed that you're in the plane seat next to them, we're the people  that give you money for that.  Exactly.  I have a, um, I enjoyed talking with Amber very much. 
[02:00:00]  Yes, I know you did.  Wow.  You got a nice picture with her.  I didn't, I didn't.  She, she saw you somewhere, there's a spark, this is all, this is all, this is what's her  name all over again.  What was that?  Kate Beckinsale, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  This is just like that time with Kate Beckinsale at the photo man.  She, you're, uh, um, gee, I didn't realize how sexy she was until she was like, oh my  God, it was really like.  Well, she was the one that, um, at the beginning of the ring, uh, I remember looking and going, 
[02:00:30]  wow, who's that girl?  She's very attractive.  She's fantastic.  And then, uh, she ends up dead in the closet.  We'd have a good time together.  There was a couple.  I'm just saying, I think it'd be fun.  We'd laugh a lot together.  Oh, sure.  Would you stop with your dreams of these Hollywood starlet girlfriends?  What, she'd parade around in little underpants and I'd go down and hit the heavy bag.  I could see them walking the red carpet to something together.  That's right.  And this is, uh, Amber Tamblyn and Jimmy Norton.  No, they wouldn't say that.  They'd say Amber Tamblyn and apparently a retarded boy. 
[02:01:00]  She's been doing charity work for them.  Hey, we, uh, we got through an interview with a hot girl, by the way.  Yes.  We're battling asses.  Radio hack alert.  Radio hack alert.  Uh-oh.  Radio hack alert.  Dave in Indianapolis.  What's up?  What's up, Opie?  Hey.  How are you doing today?  All right.  All right.  Uh, my roadie's broken this morning, so I had to listen to one of my local stations.  I like the excuse first.  I normally would have never listened to this, but God love him.  Today I heard this gem of a bit called Microwave Monday. 
[02:01:30]  Uh, they claim today they, well, he just put a, um, uh, football in the microwave for 15 minutes  because that's how long a quarter of football is.  So, we're in commercial right now, so I don't know.  We'll wait and see.  Wait a minute, but what, what, who, like, why would they do that?  What's the result?  A quarter is 15 minutes, so they're going to put this, what's a microwave have to do with a quarter?  Yeah.  That just stinks on every level.  I agree, it stinks.  And Jimmy, I love you. 
[02:02:00]  You killed in Camden.  Thank you, buddy.  Why would they do that?  Hey, we got to get the audio of this.  I want to see what happens to the football.  15 minutes in the microwave.  Oh, come on.  Something crazy's got to happen.  I'll put this back.  If it doesn't happen in eight seconds, it's not happening.  Yeah, it's not going to happen.  Nothing takes 12 minutes to microwave.  Nothing is like, well, I'll take it out in 14 minutes and it's okay.  That 15th minute is a doozy.  It's a microwave.  Dave, what's up?  You had something else?  Still in commercial.  Still in commercial.  Oh, okay.  After the break, I imagine they're just about probably 10 minutes into it, I'm guessing. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, they started the microwave already.  Yeah, yeah.  It's already started.  It started the...  10 minutes?  What's the name of the show?  I'm sorry, what?  What's the name of the show?  X103.  Stock and Gunner, I think, are the two guys.  All right.  Stock and Gunner?  Hold on the line.  We might go to you to hear this, all right?  All right.  Lock, stock, and barrel.  Hey, you wanted to thank Pittsburgh again.  Yes.  At K-Rock in Pittsburgh, you know, we were all getting our gifts and people were sending 
[02:03:00]  jerseys and I was complaining that YSP didn't give me a good enough gift.  And then YSP gave me this amazing signed Aussie thing.  Yes.  So Megan, who's the midday girl in Pittsburgh, said I wanted to one-up them.  So she sent me, and I didn't realize I did get it, a signed original Black Sabbath album,  which has got a certificate with it and everything, signed by all four members.  And a guy handed it to me, so I thought it was just a fan giving it to me.  And it was so nice.  I thought it was a fake.  And she's like, no, no, no. 
[02:03:30]  And she knows the person she got it from.  So thank you to K-Rock in Pittsburgh.  I did get that.  I think she spent a lot of money on it.  And I liked it so much, I thought it was a fake.  I'm like, there's no way that this is an original Sabbath.  But she knows the guy it came from, so I am very, very happy that that did come.  So you don't have to look for it.  I got it.  Very good.  Good for you.  So thank you, miss.  Giving away MacBooks all week.  We got our first winner.  Yes.  First winner.  One a day will do, because it's just so exciting.  So exciting.  So we'll stretch this all the way to Friday. 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  Want to hear the first winner of a MacBook?  It works out, because we have five, and there's five days in a week.  This entry won a MacBook.  Adam R.  Adam R.  Adam R.  This is what he did for the MacBook.  Huzzah!  I got to cast the spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast the spell. 
[02:04:30]  Damn it, my beanbag.  I just cast the spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Ooh, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye.  Don't be an empty.  Do ye.  That is a great job, man.  And he got it down to 30 seconds, by the way.  Good job.  Because the original was a little over, and Mark's like, no, it has to be 30 seconds.  It's in the rules.  It's in the rules. 
[02:05:00]  Mark likes rules.  It's in the rules, guys.  Rules.  We'd all be in trouble.  But Mark, I mean, the music fades for five seconds, so technically it's 32 and a half  seconds.  It's in the rules.  It has to be 30 seconds or less.  You know what else is in the rules?  Mark, when you come to work, don't wear slacks that show everything.  What do you think of them apples?  God, you have those rules.  Stupid rules.  How about next time you say about 30 seconds?  Yeah.  Because that guy almost didn't win a MacBook, and it was probably the best entry we got.  That was a good one.  He took clips from – that wasn't from one single conversation either. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  It was from a few conversations we've had over time about the Renaissance Fair.  Thank God, because that made us sound like faggots.  Well, yeah.  The Renaissance Fair and my love for certain massive multiplayer online games like EverQuest  and stuff, and me being goofed on all the time.  And another conversation about some guy that – LARPers, people that actually do this  in real life, and he put all that together to make it sound like me and Opie were actually  LARPing with the sound of swords hitting together. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Congratulations to Adam R. You just won the unbelievable new MacBook.  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities, and he can take  it with you wherever you go.  Now you can create your own music, movies, and websites.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  There you go.  We have four more winners as the week goes on here.  Yes.  Four minutes left in the show.  Thank you, sir.  Now who can agree with that, though, that that was good?  There'll be somebody calling up, dude, I sent in 15 entries.  You didn't play one. 
[02:06:30]  And they're awful.  They're awful.  The people that complain always have the worst entries.  You know, talking about Hack Radio, Burt in Philly, I can't wait until Mark Foley Fridays.  My five-year-old son has entered in the contest.  Boy, that Mark Foley is a goose.  He's a silly goose.  Dave?  Yo.  All right.  What are they doing?  Not sure.  Okay. 
[02:07:00]  I hear some kind of Green Day just ended, and now they're playing some kind of banjo music.  Banjo music, huh?  Does the fun ever end on that show?  Oh, it's a riot.  Indianapolis, huh?  What happened to the football?  I don't know.  They went from commercial to Green Day to this shit.  I hope.  Amen.  What an ass.  All right.  Hold on.  I hope it exploded and they're full of microwave pieces on the floor of their studio right now.  Tell Travis when we can go to that guy.  That'll be the grand finale. 
[02:07:30]  We've got to find out what happens to the football.  I guarantee you nothing.  They're going to take it out and go, well, it's the same as it wants.  We put him in.  Wah, wah, wah.  All right, one quick story before we get out of here.  Convicted child killer Anthony Stockerman looked like this at his trial last year,  but now he's turned up at Wabash Correctional looking like this.  On his forehead, a tattoo reading, Katie's Revenge.  Katie was the name of the girl he confessed to raping and killing last year,  Katie Coleman of Crothersville.  The Department of Corrections not saying who applied the tattoo against prison regulations  or why, still investigating. 
[02:08:00]  If I had to guess, I'd say it's a statement from the inmates.  Katie Coleman's father says he heard about the tattoo from friends  and has no idea if Katie's distant cousin, also serving time at Wabash, played any role.  When I first saw it, I thought maybe it was just somebody doing a hoax, you know, with his picture.  And then I looked at it a little bit further and found out it was a news channel that was putting this picture out.  And then I knew it had to be real.  I figure that probably Mr. Stockerman was given the choice of a tattoo or facing the same fate that Katie did. 
[02:08:30]  The early interviews that they had with him when he was in prison, when he first got there,  was that it was kind of like a vacation to him.  It wasn't bad at all.  So I'd say that he probably has a change of heart about that now.  They tattooed the dude's face.  How great is that?  The name of the victim.  How old was the girl he killed?  The name of the victim?  Yeah.  Six-year-old?  How...  Unfortunately, they gave him a choice.  That's humiliating.  Or that's what I said.  He said might have given him the same choice.  Every convict that walks through there can look at him and know he's a child killer. 
[02:09:00]  Somebody should just cut his throat.  Well, now he's going to die looking silly.  Yeah, looking all silly.  So he was just going to die, but now he's going to die looking silly.  And he's got to look at that every morning in the mirror until he gets killed.  You know, that's kind of nice.  Give him a tattoo on his father.  The state should do that.  When you're convicted of something like that, they should tattoo you.  By the way, a lot of people wondering.  Mark's on a little Jewish holiday today, so we'll get him on the radio tomorrow. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, is that it?  Yes, he's on...  What is it?  Is today Yom Kippur?  I don't know.  Yom Kippur.  He's fasting.  He's fasting?  It can't be over 30 seconds.  I like rules.  Rules are fun.  It's in the rules.  It's in the rules.  He sleeps in a big shoe at home and just pops out and says, rules.  Rules, rules, rules.  Dork.  It's a dopey radio contest for this stupid show, and he's calling out rules.  Is it fasting, or is he allowed to listen to the radio?  I don't know what the rules are.  I don't think you're allowed to leave your house. 
[02:10:00]  He's paying attention to these rules.  I don't think you're allowed to listen to the radio or watch TV.  Yeah, but they cheat.  Like, they put things on timers, and they leave it on.  That's how they get on that.  Wait, what are you talking about?  Those people, like, when they're not supposed to use electricity.  The people of the Jewish faith.  Wait, you're not allowed to use...  It's 2006.  You're not allowed to use electricity today?  I don't know exactly.  I know you've got a fan.  No, of course you don't.  On the Sabbath, you're not...  But, like, on the Sabbath, you're not supposed to, like, use electricity, and they cheat.  They put things on timers or leave things on. 
[02:10:30]  So they're not technically turning it on?  The timer is.  Yeah, because they're not allowed to turn it off either, right?  They're not allowed to acknowledge electricity.  So if it happens, be honest.  Wow.  That's stupid religion.  That's cheating.  Come on, now.  What do you think Mark's doing right now?  You know what Mark does?  As you're about to have sex, he jumps out of your pocket and goes,  Better use a condom, better safe than sorry.  Right.  Guys, it has to be 30 seconds or less.  30 seconds or less.  The dumb contest.  He's ironing his Docker slacks. 
[02:11:00]  Thank God we were able to get a hold of Adam, though, so he could cut it down to 30.  So he won the MacBook.  Congratulations, Adam.  We'll have more winners tomorrow.  Also, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  I'm in second place.  If I win that $10,000, I'm throwing it from a helicopter.  Hopefully over Pittsburgh or maybe one of the other fine cities we broadcast in.  Okay.  Hey, Mark, stop wearing wrinkle-free slacks.  It's creepy.  Dave, Indianapolis.  Hey, buddy.  What's up with the football in the microwave? 
[02:11:30]  They're still in song right now, so I imagine that as soon as this song ends, they'll probably  go into it.  Oh, God.  Everyone just on the edge of their seats waiting to see what happens to the football  in the microwave.  If that's not a big commercial for XM, nothing is.  Can you call us at XM and let us know what happened?  Yeah, there you go.  Call us at XM, Dave.  Oh, no.  He doesn't have his XM, and I just hung up on him.  I'm an ass.  Oops.  He'll call.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow if you're not joining us over at XM, where we continue exclusively.  Thank you.  Yes, we do. 
[02:12:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Check, check, check, check, check, check, check.  Are we on the radio?  Check, check, check, check.  Are we broadcasting on the radio?  Check, check, check.  Am I on the radio?  Check, one, one, one.  Check, one, two, three.  Are we on the radio? 
[02:12:30]  Yes, we are.  Check, check, check.  Are we live below?  Check, check, one, two.  Let's walk.  Yes.  All right, Sonny, good.  What was Amber saying off mic?  That Jimmy was a fucking creep, I think.  She didn't say that.  That he molested her in the green room for a picture.  She said something about, look at these jeans, Jim.  How does my backside look?  And I said, oh, I shouldn't.  Stop it.  Boy, does she look good.  Jesus. 
[02:13:00]  What a hiney.  You'll like that, huh?  I didn't realize how sexy she was.  I was just meeting her and I was like, you know, I don't want to leer at her.  And then when she's sitting there, I'm looking at the way her jeans are fitting her.  And I'm like, holy shit.  I didn't see her as much sexy as I did like cute.  That was how I first saw her.  Like she's a cute girl.  Adorable.  Yeah, yeah.  The more I looked at her body, the more I saw her.  Like, here's what I wanted to do with her.  I just wanted to kiss her and have her go, where have you been all my life?  And then I would mouth the words to Eye of the Tiger to her.  She was like a puggle.  She was like a puggle. 
[02:13:30]  A puggle.  That's right.  Just adorable and irresistible.  Not hot like a poodle.  Except I never wanted a puggle to use my face as a toilet.  Yeah.  Except that one time.  She could do the hang, too, man.  She was laughing.  She was having a good time.  Yeah.  She was a genuine good egg.  The Grudge 2.  October 13th.  It opens Friday wide.  And I actually really do want to see that.  It's easy just to bullshit somebody.  But that's actually a movie I'll go see.  Don't you say that all the time now.  Opens Friday wide.  We talked about this on the show.  Because of Silly Roland.  Well, we talked about this on the show last week. 
[02:14:00]  You bring this stuff home to you.  Yeah.  From the radio show.  My new one is from Secret Asian Man.  Oh, I forgot the line now.  Oh, hey.  Take away your name.  Take away your name.  Take away your name.  Who wants to hear Club Soda Kenny sing Secret Asian Man?  Uh-huh.  Come on.  Well, we got a nice crowd, Kenny.  Why not?  Just do the hook, okay?  Uh-huh.  The first verse.  As much as you know off the top of your stupid head. 
[02:14:30]  He wants to do Secret.  If you know the words, sing along.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  Everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Everybody, Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man. 
[02:15:00]  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Take it away.  Everybody in Pittsburgh wanted to hear me sing that song.  Oh, who wouldn't?  Yeah, Kenny was telling me the story on the way to work today.  They were driving him nuts with that, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All I want to do is sell merchandise.  He's helping me at the end sell merch, and we're taking pictures, and they're all bugging  to say, they want me to bring him on stage and sing.  Sing the song.  That video has a chance to go viral on YouTube.  People are viewing it like crazy. 
[02:15:30]  Check it out for yourself.  And now there's an alternate little clip now of him just singing on the street.  It's like, hey, this is the same retarded guy now out on the street singing it.  Yeah, I think we'll throw that up on YouTube.  I'm thinking of touring with William Hung.  Oh, there you go.  Hey!  I know those guys!  Hey, look, we're on the back of a bus.  Hey!  And if you don't want to be on the front of one, cross the green, not in between.  You should tour with him.  It'll be William Hung and Kenny not.  Kenny, you got a little one? 
[02:16:00]  I'm working on Goldfinger as my follow-up.  He didn't answer the question.  Yeah, I know.  What is that, all that's left of Mac?  Don't touch it with even your shoe.  There's some, like, homeless waste material.  Oh, Kenny, don't touch it.  You know what that means now?  What?  Someone else has to get my smoothie.  All right.  That hand.  That hand that just touched that. 
[02:16:30]  That's evidence of a rape right there.  Is that what it is?  It's a girl's blazer.  It's a girl's blazer.  Jesus, what happened to her?  Well, it was probably thrown out, and then some homeless guy wore it and didn't care  for it.  And threw it away, you know.  Kenny, now you got to use the Purell before you get my smoothie.  Smoothie would be like a Petri dish.  We have a lovely little crowd with us today.  Thank you.  Yeah, what's the occasion?  We got a nice crowd today.  It's nice out, and we're very lovable.  Very. 
[02:17:00]  Very!  There's a lot of big buildings in New York.  I live here.  I like looking up.  I like just looking up when I walk around.  I do, too.  I'm looking at the new posters.  I got to give them a plug.  The Killers were on SNL over the weekend.  Yeah.  They played two songs.  They were unbelievable.  They got their new album coming out.  In store is what?  Now?  Okay.  Why don't we get them in studio?  Aren't we supposed to get them in studio?  I would love to get these guys in studio.  What's the name of their new album?  Lambstown?  Yeah, their new music was really, really good.  Samstown?  The very best of Jerry Garcia. 
[02:17:30]  Enough already.  I know.  We get it.  And stupid Rod Stewart now singing the rock classics.  How about you write a new song?  Yeah, how about you sing, We're Having a Party, and then Fist Yourself.  That song sucked.  Why would you remake it?  Well, thank God Diddy got something out.  And the Beastie Men.  I like the fact that the Beastie Men are out.  Jesus Christ.  Monica.  Yeah.  Showing her titties all over the cities. 
[02:18:00]  She's a lovely girl.  We've seen her.  Fergie as the Duchess.  Fergie.  She's pretty.  And nothing on this.  I mean, this amazes me.  That show Lennon's new CD is called Friendly Fire.  That just doesn't seem right.  Well, it's probably a war reference.  It's probably a war reference.  You think?  Because the original title was Don't Sign That.  There's the joke.  Bravo, Jimmy.  I do like walking around just looking up at the big buildings.  And it's such a faggy, please mug me thing to do. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, I know.  It's a touristy thing where you look up.  Well, the city is growing, this city, by leaps and bounds, I must say.  It certainly is.  They keep doing what Opie calls pulling teeth.  They just pull one of these little buildings out.  And then they, remember this building used to be, there used to be two guys that were living there.  I believe a gay couple.  And they would walk around semi-nude.  Nude.  Semi-nude.  Well, they took down the old Shelly Steakhouse.  That was good food, too. 
[02:19:00]  They're taking down the building next to it.  And then some huge 40-story building is going to go in that little hole.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  So.  I love the fact that there's people who are going to be living there that for the next six months are not going to be able to sleep past eight in the morning.  Oh, just.  Gah.  All right.  Let's go inside.  All right.  They were a lovely group.  We're going to invite you, you, and you, and everyone else go home.  It's like the velvet rope.  Go home.  The velvet rope. 
[02:19:30]  There's a nice couple that was here.  They had pictures of us.  They could come.  They could come.  They're a married couple.  This is like Studio 54 with the gay sex.  Jimmy, you get to pick two people and come upstairs.  Does the couple want to come upstairs?  The guy and the girl couple?  They were nice people.  All right.  And everyone else go home?  No, pick somebody else.  I want to pick one person.  I want him.  I want to pick one person.  The guy behind the desk when we walk in because he works so hard.  Wait.  You know what?  Really fast.  I don't want to be known as the prick today, so Kenny, please let everyone come upstairs because 
[02:20:00]  they believe me at home and I'm an asshole.  All right.  I want to invite the guy at the desk because he seems to work hard, and I don't think he  really understands our show.  Dude, he must be on break.  I've never seen anything like that.  What, Jimmy?  I'm with the...  He's right there.  There's some type of a mutated genital wart.  Jimmy, with a piece of colored ribbon hanging around it.  Why would somebody mutate a genital wart and hang a colored ribbon around it? 
[02:20:30]  I don't understand how it's always wearing a tie.  I don't either.  There's the weirdest stuff that goes on in this building.  All right.  Now, be nice.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  It's Monday.  Start the week off nice, Jimmy.  Watch my exam.  Good morning.  Good morning, sir.  You bump on a cunt.  Good morning.  Hello.  Great.  That's lovely.  See you upstairs.  I like that in a woman. 
[02:21:00]  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance due to the onslaught of the communist masters of  deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  Here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[02:21:30]  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bag.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:22:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, hi, taking way, I love that part. 
[02:22:30]  Everyone just asks Kenny to sing now.  That's all he's known for now.  You're known for little things throughout history.  Remember, I hear ya.  That's a classic. 
[02:23:00]  I'm really leaving my mark on the world.  Yeah, you're not a one-hit wonder.  I know.  You've come up with things over the years.  I just kept your name right out there.  Yeah, I wish I had something witty to say right now.  Well, why change most things?  I'm talking about these things.  I said you're not a one-hit wonder, but you're like Boston with albums, you know?  Right.  It takes a lot of years before in between each one.  You look forward to the next one, but you don't expect it very soon. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  So the Secret Agent Man, now very popular and people are bugging you on the streets.  Can I say something about Boston?  They're horrible.  What?  They're awful.  The band?  Oh, the band.  I thought you meant the city, and I was going to agree.  No, no, I love the city.  I love the city of Boston, but the band was just atrocious.  Yeah.  Fucking more than a feeling.  What are some other songs they had?  More than a feeling.  Is it?  Well, they were pretty big. 
[02:24:00]  It was them and Frampton back then, I think.  Come on, how do you not like this?  Fucking 8,000th time of 30.  Well, believe me, when it comes on now, it goes right off.  As it should.  But back then, this is like the shit.  That stupid album cover with the fucking flying city and the zapping stuff.  Now it's ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  But Boston.  Like now it's ridiculous, and you've heard the song so many times, but back then, this was the shit. 
[02:24:30]  This was good stuff.  Double leads with the guitars.  Why are we talking about Boston?  We just kind of got, I don't know how the hell that happened.  One hit wonders.  Oh, because Kenny is not a one hit wonder.  And also how many.  It was Kenny.  I said, Kenny isn't a one hit wonder, because he's got his hit song now.  But he also, you had sayings like, I hear ya.  Right.  So he's got a career that spans the years.  But he goes, and I wish I had something witty to say now.  And I said, it's never expected.  Kenny comes out with stuff as often as Boston did. 
[02:25:00]  You know, it's very memorable.  You look forward to it, but you don't expect it quickly.  And then Boston came up.  Of course, Jimmy hates Boston, because it's not Sabbath.  I was just saying, they were the shit back in the day.  They were the shit.  The album cover looks ridiculously silly now.  It's a flaming fucking spaceship with a Boston and a city in it.  And they are guitars, sir.  We're guitars.  One of the spaceships are guitars.  Oh, awful.  I never knew that.  With cities on them.  I'm glad I didn't know that. 
[02:25:30]  One of the rare albums that doesn't have a bad song on it.  First Boston album.  See, I feel just the opposite about it.  You think every song stinks.  I think it's a rarity that they can put so many abominable tunes in one place.  Oh, God.  I don't like them.  I love Boston growing up.  This is huge.  What are some other songs they have?  Maybe I'll be older.  I like that.  How many hits are on this?  A lot of hits.  A lot of hits, but of course.  It's been such a long time.  Think I should be going.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I never heard that.  Starting with foreplay.  Yes, you have.  A little guitar work, and then it goes into long time. 
[02:26:00]  Here's some more, Derek, please.  You've heard every single song.  Gonna hit your ride.  Head to the other side.  You've heard every single song on that album.  I hate the fucking high-pitched Bee Gees vibe of the late 70s and all these fucking queers  had.  It was all, yeah, very high-pitched vocals.  I know that I'm a man, but I sing like a girl. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  I've never heard this rock and roll band.  It's a great song, too.  It's fucking awful.  Bob Seger should be humming this.  It's like that, just that undefinable late 70s rock.  What's wrong with Bob Seger?  The old-time rock and roll.  Turn the page.  We got tonight.  Exactly.  He's just a douche.  Turn the page.  Even Metallica.  No, that's how great that song was.  I don't know Turn the Page. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Get Turn the Page, Bob Seger.  I might have heard it.  But, boss, the first album?  Of course.  The first album was great.  The second album was almost as great.  Had to wait for years and years and years.  That's why I hate them.  And then the third album came out, what was it, Third Stage, it was called?  It was called Stinkaroo.  With Cool the Engines.  Wasn't Amanda on that, too?  Amanda.  They got really wimpy.  That's why I hate them, because they have fucking three albums in 25 years.  I just think they're assholes.  Well, then they came up with an album, like, I don't know, only a couple years ago, called  Corporate America.  I'm like, what? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, man.  Boy, you're 20 years too late.  Yeah, you fucking cornballs.  You used to have the same type of album art and everything.  What year did that come out?  Now it's silly.  It's awful.  Journey did the same thing, though, with the spaceship.  And the thematic titles, Departure, all these things, with the spaceship art and stuff.  It was kind of big back then for some stupid reason.  Boston had highest debuting album of all time, Rob in Connecticut.  Of course.  Rob, is that true?  Absolutely.  Okay. 
[02:28:00]  Let me see the new album.  I think I love you, but you've got to do better than just Ozzy.  Dude, I like a lot of music.  I just don't like Boston.  Ozzy, I like Sabbath.  I like Sabbath.  I like fucking old kids.  You know, Ford with Ozzy.  I like Johnny Cash.  I have a very weird musical taste.  I have a very eclectic taste.  Let's go into your iPod.  It's the hackiest bit ever, but take a little trip into Jimmy's iPod.  Every time we go on the road, all of a sudden you hear from Jimmy's iPod.  She's got 30 days.  I'm hacking too many. 
[02:28:30]  Here's what I was listening to on the way in this morning.  Let me see if you can hear it through the headphones.  Wait.  All right.  All right.  Show off.  Megadeth.  I'm saying Megadeth.  That's what I was going to say.  All right.  But that is indicative of what's on there.  Give us one of the hacky saws on there.  I'll go over, let's see.  Hold on.  Last.  I don't notice the headphones come out.  Jimmy, this bit doesn't work if you don't go hacky.  No, no.  What I was doing was this.  I was going to go over a playlist.  Last 25 played or most recently played. 
[02:29:00]  So just honest.  Oh, wait, wait.  Hold on.  We are recently played.  Recently played.  Here we go.  There's going to be a couple of douches on there.  What the fuck is this?  Love me do?  Love me do.  Over at the Frankenstein.  Love me do.  Over at the Frankenstein place.  Super heroes.  I don't know what they are.  Yes, you do.  No, I swear to God, dude.  I really don't.  What did some feckers come in and reprogram it?  Then there was Damn It Janet from Rocky Horror. 
[02:29:30]  I love that tune.  I love the whole soundtrack.  And then there was Eternal Flame.  The Bangles.  And then there was Revolutioneer, which my ex-girlfriend actually sang, which I really like a lot.  Look.  Eternal Flame.  You're just.  And then there's Party Hard by Andrew W.K.  She's Gone, a very nice Sabbath ballad off Technical Ecstasy.  Rock and Roll, Doctor, a bunch of, I played the whole CD.  At least I have Manic Monday on mine and not Eternal Flame.  I have that.  I have Manic Monday.  I have Walk Like an Egyptian.  What am I, a queer?  You have to have all three.  I didn't go with the big Walk Like an Egyptian novelty hit. 
[02:30:00]  You want to fight all the cops here in the donut shop.  It says a lot.  It says a lot, Anthony.  Joe in Massachusetts.  Joe.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's going on over there, buddy?  Hey.  I'm starting to wonder about you.  Why?  I have very eclectic taste.  What's wrong with that?  Eclectic now means faggot.  You've never heard of Turn the Page.  Come on.  I swear to God, dude.  My recently added, I just bought a live Jim Croce CD, which is very rare.  I love Jim Croce.  What's your favorite Jim Croce song?  Jim Croce's a fag. 
[02:30:30]  No, he's not.  He's brilliant.  No.  I mean, I want to say, I love, obviously, Time in a Bottle is fucking, you can't not like  that.  Operator, I think, is brilliant.  Harry Chapin, I think, was a genius songwriter.  I like Harry Chapin a lot.  Well, you have had a cock in your mouth, so yeah.  Dude, I like Harry Chapin.  Dude, what is dick sucky about the fucking guy that sang W-O-L-D or fucking 30,000 pounds  of bananas?  You know, all right, though, you're gay.  You listen to Air Supply.  I don't like Air Supply, dude.  I really don't. 
[02:31:00]  I would tell you.  All right.  I don't even like fucking Little River Band.  What do you think of them apples, fella?  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  All right.  Well, that's all I liked when I was a boy.  All right.  Gary in Dallas, what's up?  What's up, dude?  Jimmy, come on.  You don't like Boston?  I mean, they got an excellent drummer.  I don't know.  You know, who's your second favorite drummer besides Savas?  Well, dude, I mean, come on.  You know who I love, dude?  It's fucking Mickey D from Motorhead is an amazing drummer.  Obviously, Neil Peart, fucking Grohl is a great drummer.  I mean, I'm out of dope. 
[02:31:30]  I don't think Bill Ward's the best that I've ever lived.  What about Chad Sexton from 311?  I think he's probably like the best drummer on top of the game to take.  Okay.  Maybe he is.  I just don't know.  But Mickey D from Motorhead I've been getting into a lot.  And I know metal sometimes gets a bad rap for how great they are as musicians.  But when you listen to Metallica or certain bands, you're like, these guys are fucking  great musicians, too.  They're not just heavy.  All right.  Thank you, Gary.  But yeah, I have some queer shit in my iPod.  Fucking Jenny from the Block.  I got fucking...  Oh, no.  You don't still have Jenny from the Block.  Delete it right now or I'll punch you in the face.  Delete it.  Turn the page.  You know what's funny? 
[02:32:00]  Ringing a bell.  They just handed me a communique.  We only have the live version.  This is the version everyone knows.  It's not sounding familiar, but I know.  I've heard it.  What planet were you on for certain years?  I listened to Kiss in the 70s, man.  But you couldn't avoid this.  You could not avoid this song.  And Metallica re-did it only a few years ago. 
[02:32:30]  This was like...  One of the greatest remakes ever, by the way.  James Hetfield did an amazing job on this.  Every chick did a rug act to this song and the tit bars.  And it kicks in.  You really don't know this song, Jimmy?  It's going to be on your iPod by the end of the day.  It's actually a good tune.  I mean, I don't mind.  For the time, too.  Like, this guy was the shit also.  The range this guy has is ridiculous.  One of my favorite tunes, 25 Most Played.  One of them, I Remember You by Skid Row.  That's a good song.  Fucking great tune. 
[02:33:00]  Damn it, Janet.  Life Goes On on the Wall by Johnny Cash.  1916, my favorite Motorhead song.  A lot of D.O.  Saturday Morning, fucking by Harry Chapin.  See, you know what's funny about Jimmy?  A lot of people think he has a one-track mind with Ozzy and stuff.  But it's so out there.  He goes deep with his songs.  Fucking...  You know, I've been in the business.  So keep up the ass with some of those songs.  Now you fucking go deep.  I was a music jock for way too many years.  Way too many.  And you just named a bunch of songs I'd never heard of before. 
[02:33:30]  Never heard of.  There was a little bit of Blondie, who I like.  Call Me, Misfit, by Geezer Butler's band.  And I told you, Party Hard, a little bit of Dio.  I Need to Know by fucking Mark Anthony.  Overture to the Sun.  Which is fucking...  I don't know if you can hear this or not.  This is from Clockwork Orange.  I don't hear enough.  Wow, what do you do to this?  Wait.  Do you promenade around your fucking abode?  Just your underpants on? 
[02:34:00]  Would thou like an ale?  It's a fucking...  If you have Overture for the Sun from Clockwork, it is amazing.  It's such a good tune.  It's when he walks out on the stage and the guy goes,  Hello, evildoer.  And they slap him in the face.  He tries to grab the girl's tits.  He goes...  That's the tune they're playing.  It's Overture to the Sun.  How do you not love it?  God.  Oh My God, by the fucking Kaiser Chiefs.  America Fuck Yeah.  Some kind of sick joke that's on there.  Apparently I played that a lot.  Just the sound. 
[02:34:30]  Let's go to Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  I love you.  Thank you.  What is with your music taste, guys?  What's wrong with my music taste?  It's fucking so old, man.  Hey, can you listen to some new metal for me?  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of stuck in the old days, dude.  I'm a very weird, like, obsessively loyal thing to my taste.  Like, what's new metal?  There's some that I like that I like.  Well, how about Dragon Force or Protest the Hero?  How about Lamb of God?  I never heard. 
[02:35:00]  I heard they're very good.  I like Godsmack a lot.  I like fucking Metallica.  Godsmack is not metal, man.  What are they?  What are you looking for?  Like, thrash death metal?  What the...  No, not at all.  What kind of metal?  They're doing really good.  What metal is being put out today?  Put on some Dragon Force.  I'm sure you guys got that in your computer.  Put on some...  Go ahead.  Let me hear some.  It'll start in a minute. 
[02:35:30]  We don't have it in the system.  We don't have it in the system.  No, we do.  Oh, wait, we do.  We don't have it in the system.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, my...  Hold on, hold on.  Derek's an idiot.  Ryan, I don't know that band at all.  Give us a song we can play.  Um...  Don't go deep.  Go with the wand.  Yeah.  Yeah, through the flame.  What is it called?  Through the flame.  Oh, through the flame.  Through the flame.  Let's, uh...  All right, this is metal.  Sounds like the final countdown. 
[02:36:00]  The final countdown!  What is it?  All right, let me hear the vocals.  Dragon Force.  On the station.  Oh, okay.  That's not bad.  Dude, but it's...  This is nothing new.  This is nothing new.  Well, what else can they do with a guitar?  I know.  All right, well, then listen to the band.  You want to hear, look, best...  Look, well, do we have fucking...  Best song opening ever.  Do we have fucking Accept, Fast as a Shark? 
[02:36:30]  Please.  What?  Please, Mr. Cheswick.  No.  No, I...  Guys!  I've never heard of before.  I'm trying to help a motherfucker out.  All right, boys.  Hold on, this is it.  What is this?  I bet you it kicks in.  Yeah, of course it does.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:00]  Rock and roll.  Yeah, this is pretty good.  This is fucking heavy, man.  This will get you tickets.  Feeding tickets.  Fucking heavy.  I like that, actually.  Yeah.  It's like...  Almost has an old Van Halen sound to it.  Yeah, I don't know whether...  This song is from quite a while ago.  It's Van Halen's first, obviously.  Let's go to Dave in Indianapolis.  Dave?  Well, I think that they must be listening to you guys, because they haven't went back to 
[02:37:30]  the football deal yet.  Oh, they didn't go back to it?  No, why?  Because nothing happened, and they're not brave enough to admit it to their audience.  It's stuck.  But nothing happened.  Well, they're milking it, dude.  Well, they're milking it until the end.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe they're going to tease it.  All right.  Well, I'm on the edge of my seat, so let us know, Dave.  You want me to just hang on?  Yeah, or call us back when something's going on.  Stay there, Dave.  All right.  I'll give you a shout back.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, Fez.  Let's go to John in West Virginia.  John? 
[02:38:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Great show Saturday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy, for coming.  Appreciate it.  No problem.  You signed my little picture for me, and I got to ride in the elevator at the hotel  with Kenny, and he had nuts.  There was like four people in there, and they didn't have any idea who he was.  As soon as they got off their floor, Kenny popped his little head out.  You dropped something, and they came running back.  Hilarious.  Ah, you ass.  That's really good.  See you, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, boy.  Hey, can we play the new killer song going into break, speaking of new music? 
[02:38:30]  No, I picked the last one.  Jimmy, what do you want to hear?  Wait.  I don't care.  How about...  No, it's got to be something special.  You can't just pull one out of thin air.  Out of your ass.  Well, we're going to pick songs at the end, right?  At the end of the show.  All right.  You do one.  I want to just play a taste of the killer song.  I don't mind that.  I like those guys.  And at the end of the show, you will pick a song.  I'm scared.  Something that you want to turn the audience on to.  I hope I do good.  It's a big grapefruit.  It certainly is.  Do we have the latest from the killers? 
[02:39:00]  What's the name of the song?  Yeah.  Okay, Ralph.  This is the killers off the new CD, When You Were Young.  Check out a piece as we go to break.  You sit there in your heartache 
[02:39:30]  Waiting on some beautiful boy to  To save you from your old ways  You play forgiveness  Watch it now  Here he comes  He doesn't look a thing like Jesus  But he talks like a gentleman  Like you imagine with you  When you're young  Can we climb this mountain? 
[02:40:00]  I don't know  Higher now than ever before  I know we can make it if we take it slow  That's taking easy, easy now  Watch it go  We're burning down the highway sky  I'm on the back of a hurricane  That started turning when you were young  When you were young 
[02:40:30]  And sometimes you close your eyes  And see the place where you used to live  When you were young  When you were young  They say the devil's water 
[02:41:00]  It ain't so sweet  You don't have to drink right now  But you can tip your feet  Every once in a little while  Is it better in your heartache 
[02:41:30]  Waiting on some beautiful boy to  To save you from your old ways  You play forgiveness  Watch it now  Here he comes  He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
[02:42:00]  But he talks like a gentleman  Like you imagine when you were young  I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus  I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus  He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
[02:42:30]  For more than you'll ever know  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony  And the talk is racy  And raw at times  Pushing the limits  As far as they can  Show your hairy pork chop  My mother smokes crack rocks  I'm for drunk teens  What are you kidding? 
[02:43:00]  How about I lay you down  And give you a little bukkake  We laugh  We're gonna have a disgusting body fluid blowout  Gay porn  Hey could you soap up your bad place?  The sluttier the better  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you  If we both already had AIDS  It's certainly not your father's talk radio  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show

Because you have a memory like an elephant  He asked me if I have the glossy screen  And I said no  Because I don't like to see my reflections  He goes  I don't like to see my  Because you can see yourself  And I don't like to see my reflection  And I was just like  That was such a deep  Hidden away thought  That came out  That was  That was  That was  Oh, absolutely  Little Kenny  He's trying  He's on the computer  Escaping from Kenny  He doesn't want to look at Kenny 
[02:44:30]  He doesn't want to look back  And see that lumbering  Man  Yet deep inside  Young fellow  Who had the little dingle  He's little  Little Kenny Dingle  He was probably called as a boy  Little Dingle  And we were one time  We were in  What were we doing in Dallas  And there was a magician's convention  Ugh  That was awful  And they're all doing tricks all over  Of course they are  And there's one magician  What was he spinning?

Congressman Foley  That's right  724 AM  I always use lotion and the hand  That was Anthony during the discussion of Congressman Foley's internet chat with the 16 year old boy  And the masturbation reference was clear  Explains Al Dukes  Yeah I thought he'd say that 
[02:48:30]  It was a little too clear  725 AM  Lotion in hand  As Eric was being redundant and explaining what was dumped  What an ass  I love when people repeat what was dumped  It's like  Yeah we said the guy was jerking off  You know  This guy was jerking off  Oh dude that got dumped  Where you said the guy was jerking off  Yeah  Oh  The jerking off part  The guy jerking off

[02:49:30]  To let people know it was masturbation  Without it technically coming out as masturbation  So I don't agree with that  Thank you  And the last one  733 AM from a caller  That's some of the sickest shit I ever heard  Alright  Very good  Thank you  Al does catch those little curses though  He's good  He's really good  Well his job depends on it  His ear  Very attuned  Jimmy  You ready to get sad  I don't want to be sad Opie

I'm always like that  People think sometimes  I'm high  I'm on drugs or whatnot  I'm high  I'm high on life  Other people would think that perhaps you're doing it because the camera's on  But when you're private  The private Mr. T's not like that  No when I'm at home  When I'm at home 
[02:52:30]  You know  I read my bible  Then I relax  My mother told me to rest  So when I'm out in the thing  I try to energize  I have fun with what I'm doing  I like doing  I like doing what I'm doing  I like meeting the people  Greeting them  Having fun  See  My celebrity status allowed me this platform  To reach the people  To motivate them  To go to the schoolyards  To go back to the ghetto  To tell the kids  Stay away from drugs  Listen to their parents  Stay on the school  Stay off to do  You've always been my message  I've been to the prisons and whatnot  And talked to people  The cameras wasn't there  You know  I was doing that before the stuff  You know  So this is just who I am 
[02:53:00]  See  And plus  I've been pitying fools for 20 years  See the show just caught up with me pitying people  You see what I mean  And then when I pity people  You know  It's not a bad thing  You know  Pity  That means mercy  You mentioned you read the bible  You're a religious man  Yes  Yes  Yes  Do you  Are you going to include that as part of your show?  No  No  I mean  But  I won't people know  I don't fuck that on nobody  But we did an episode with a family  You know  We have breakfast on the show  And they ask me to bless the food  To say the blessing  And I do that  You know  One of the parents  You know  We was in a situation one day 
[02:53:30]  He actually  Mr. T is an interesting guy  Like he was like a bodyguard  Right  That's how he got  He was a tough man  A bouncer  A bouncer  He's from like the fucking  I think Cabrini Green projects in Chicago  He's from a really tough fucking  Yeah tough guy  And he told some weird story one time  About how somebody had mugged his mother  And he had a bunch of brothers  And he made some reference  To the fact that they killed a guy for it  Yeah  It was an older interview  You have to  Yeah they did something really bad  I wish I could  Had a better tie up for that 
[02:54:00]  Sorry people  I start a story  I started off a mediocre story  And made it boring and horrible immediately  I pity you  Right now  I pity me too Mr. T  He's coming in  And I pity Jim for that last story  That's all I would do  Is just agree with him  I pity him too Mr. T  I want to be his co-host  For I pity the fool  He'll pity me  I can't smile  Please pity me Mr. T  He has a motivational album  Someone say  We gotta get a copy of that  Oh he certainly  He's gonna like him  Co-host that just follows him  Going  Because that's the 
[02:54:30]  Universal sound of the pity  I pity the fool  I  So does he  We should run into band houses  One guy fucking another guy  Without a rubber  I pity the fool  That thinks this is safe behavior  Alright moving on  You guys ready to laugh  Oh  We need that clip by the way  The Homer clip  Are you ready to laugh  We don't have that right  That was one of our old clips  We just have this one now  Does anybody remember laughing  Alright  That's a damn  Put on your laughing hats 
[02:55:00]  This house is where police say  A pregnant 16 year old girl  Was forced to take turpentine  To end her pregnancy  The mother and two cousins  Were involved in  Actually  According to the victim  Forcibly having her take a quantity  Of turpentine  On two different occasions  Explaining to her that this would  Help kill her baby  That this would do away with her pregnancy  Detectives say the teen  Was forced to take turpentine  Mixed with sugar  To chase off the jarring taste 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  Relatives may have tried  To terminate the pregnancy  After discovering  The father of the baby  Uh oh  Is over 30 years old  Oh  Because the girl is 16  The age of consent  No statutory rape charges  Were filed  Unfortunately  One local doctor says  Too often she sees patients  Who have used a home remedy  Like turpentine  To abort a pregnancy  It is a known substance  That has been used in abortions  The problem with that is  You know 
[02:56:00]  It will cause an abortion  Yes  But it will also cause you to die  For the fetus to die  The mother has to be  Either dead or near death  Problem solved  The teenager involved  In this case was lucky  Initial exam showed no injury  To her or the fetus  She is now carrying out her pregnancy  In protective custody  See  Bastard and whore are doing fine  That just proves you could drink  When you're pregnant  Yeah if you could drink  Turpentine  Yeah you could drink  How do you think  That kid's gonna feel  Every time somebody  Lights a match around  His face just bursting in flames 
[02:56:30]  That's nice to know  Your mother's like  Was I wanted  Well I did drink some turpentine  And I tried to drop you  On the linoleum floor  Trying to get rid of you  I was getting a little nervous  When they said  Because the father was  I'm like  Oh here it comes  Here it comes  Over 30 years old  Why don't we stop that tape  We should have stopped it  Stopped it right there  Well try to guess  We can go back and do it  Yeah  I don't know  Why'd this guy by the way  The moment's ruined  Some guy  Doing the walk off with us 
[02:57:00]  Today gave me this little  Original Cajun Ben  Petite gator head  Is this a real alligator head  That is a genuine  Decapitated alligator head  They used to be  They used to be endangered  Gators and crocs and stuff  Now  They're back  Back with a vengeance  They're eating people now  This thing looks like  It was a very very small alligator  And the teeth on this thing  If you touch these things  I mean  This thing could  I could put an eye out  Oh my god  Are these sharp  That'll take a firm 
[02:57:30]  Right off  I feel bad though  That this little guy  Was killed  Here's the guy  Like sir  Where do they get this  It's a lizard  Jimmy  Get over it  It's an alligator  It's a little baby alligator  It's a reptile  It's a reptile  Oh no don't break it  No I don't want to break it  Because I feel bad  This thing's dead  I feel bad that it's dead  You're breaking  I don't think he'd break that  Hey how about you talking to the mic  That's very big in New Orleans  Gator heads  I know  Why though  This is a nice little  I mean they're creepy animals  But why kill it  Decapitated  So you can wear it on a gold chain 
[02:58:00]  You know  Wear it on your chain  Gold chain  Wow  Match your gold teeth  And they use the rest of it  For other things  Yeah handbags and stuff  The feet are used for tables  You know  The tail is used for  I don't know what  There's just no reason  Croc shoes  I'm not mad at  Crocodile shoes  I mean  Luggage  Oldie time luggage  If you want to live in the 50's  You just  You know  You have the little  Alligator skin bag  He's not happy  Even though they make him  Look like he's smiling  If he could talk  He'd probably say  You know  I used to have a body  And I don't know  Where it is anymore 
[02:58:30]  My mouth doesn't even close  I  I love  I just  I have this  Hope  That when people disappear  There's UFO sightings  That somewhere on some planet  Some alien radio show  Some guy's walking in  Giving a human head  Just smiling  And hollowed out  Do you know  My name is  Alfred A. Gator  Alfred A. Gator 
[02:59:00]  You look  You don't look happy  I'm not happy  I used to have a body  But I don't anymore  I eat food  That doesn't go anywhere  I just have a head  What are you going to do  To your alligator head there  Yeah  I can't display it  I mean I'm not  Why  I don't know  I believe that'll probably  Remain in the office  Yeah  I don't like animals being  But it was a gift  From this fine gentleman  Well I'm not pissed at him  Because it was nice  Of him to think of me  And to take a  You know  It was probably killed you mainly

[03:00:00]  And some are saying  They can be dangerous  We're talking about  Those colorful rubber shoes  Called Crocs  A new report  Says they may lead  To injuries as well  In Arkansas  A child had  Part of a foot amputated  After the Crocs  Got stuck in the metal teeth  Of an escalator  The Crocs company  Says the shoe  Will soon come  With a warning label  Wait  Why  My kids never got into them  No but they are  Certainly popular  Yeah  They are really adorable  You're never more than  Seven minutes away  From weather and traffic  Part of a foot amputated  Weather and traffic 
[03:00:30]  Coming up  My four year old loves them  He loves them  I think they're nice  And the little ones  With the big ones  I'm not getting  Listen either way  We're leaving Crocs season  Right now  It's a little chilly out there  Child foot amputated  Leaving Crocs  I love them  On an escalator  What are they  There has to be a better way  To shut the fucking escalators off  Jesus  How do we not know that already  There's one button  All the way in the bottom  What are we going to do  If your foot's caught  Go back down  And shut it off  There's one at the top  You just got to make sure  You hit it  As you're stuck  You got one shot at it  Wait  I want to know  This kid's 
[03:01:00]  What is a Croc shoe  Is that made from an alligator  A real animal  What is a Croc shoe  Oh you would know  Sam of course he does  Yo he's an OG  His awful feet pointing out  I only know  Because I cut up the story  It's one of those  Rubber slip on shoes  That people are wearing  It's like a solid color  And there's holes  Near where the toe is  It's like a flip flop almost  But it's completely covered  It's not a nice looking shoe  Then how did it get  Thank you  It's not a nice looking shoe  So how did it  Steve Madden 
[03:01:30]  How did it  Oh those shoes  Let me take a look there  This is the latest rage  These things stink  Can you turn the Croc shoes then  So I can see them  Before I slash them  Dan turn it around  They're not made of crocodiles  Let's take a look Dan  That's fine  They're these dumb beach shoes  That everyone's wearing  With the holes in them  It looks like a clog  It had the kid's foot  Get caught in the escalator  They're like pink  And they're obnoxious colors  And these holes all  Because he was probably  Horse playing  He was probably horse playing  That's true  He was probably  Jumping up and down 
[03:02:00]  And about  And trying to walk backwards  Down the up escalator  Which is something  You always want to do  But it's very dangerous  He was jumping about  Yes  Hey we got the sex bird  Back from London  What?

Wait what book?  Jimmy wasn't here Friday  So explain

A grope room is this place  Where you can't see the guys  But they can see you  And they just pull their pants down  And pull their dick out  And you just suck them off  And yeah  Whoa whoa whoa  Don't just breeze through that  Where does one go 
[03:03:00]  To be a part of a grope room?  Well I suppose you'd have to come  To where I go  In a place called  Our Place for Fun  In London, England  You'd have to come  To little old London  For that one  And wait why can't you see them?  Because it's black  The room's completely black  It's a little room  And there's like these bars  In between you and them  Like kind of jailhouse bars  And the side that I'm on  Has just got a black light  And the side that they're on  Is completely pitch black  So I can't see them at all  So all you see basically  Is a row of white dicks 
[03:03:30]  It's almost like a  Blurry Hall type thing  Oh okay wow  It is very  Yeah  Did you enjoy sucking  All those cocks?  Yeah I really do  It's like  It's very energizing  Are you  I don't know what you look like  Is there a picture of her?

Alright  Yeah  You know something  We'll take a stab at it 
[03:05:00]  What'd you do this weekend?  So this weekend  I went out  What?  So I went out  With this guy  Who's a black stripper  Called Rump Shaker  And went dancing with him  And then we went to my car  Which was parked  In a car park in Soho  That's Soho in London  Oh Soho in London  Yes of course  Yeah  Not Soho  Where you are  And then  And then I sent him off  In this car park  And looked up  To see that the 4x4 
[03:05:30]  Park next to us  Was pulling out  So they got a good look  As well  And then the car park  At what?  What was going on?  Yeah I was sucking off  His black 10 inch cock  You were sucking off  A 10 inch black cock  Did you have a ruler?  I think you're overestimating  Even for a black guy  How do you know it was 10?  10 inches  Jesus Christ lady  I've seen a lot of cocks  Believe me  It was 10 inches  You could just look at it  Flint with sharks  That's an 8 inch cock  10  10  Right  You look between the balls 
[03:06:00]  And the head  How does one know  They have a 10 inch cock  In their mouth?  Well because it won't go  All the way to the back  Of your throat  I think that's a pretty good indicator  You have to be resuscitated  After the blowjob  Exactly  Exactly  No that's absolutely true  Well  Yeah it was big  Okay maybe it was 9  Could have been 9  Okay  An inch  Between friends  It was big  And whore  How did that make you feel?  Yeah  It made me feel great  You ever think of your daddy  When a black man's love juice 
[03:06:30]  Is being shot down your throat?  Some random man  Funnily enough  I never think of my daddy  You never think of a daddy's little girl  And what do you think of you  In that exact situation right there?  No  That's not what I'm thinking  Hey whore  No I never think about that  Hey whore  What's the worst thing  That happened to you sexually?  The worst thing  Oh god  Probably being wanked over  By this guy  In a little room  Who said afterwards 
[03:07:00]  Oh god  That was really gross  What do you mean?  And I said  Well what did you do it for then?  And he said  I don't know  I haven't had sex  With a stranger in years  What was gross?  I didn't know what was gross  I said  What's so gross?  I said  You're cum  You know  Maybe  Maybe he was just saying that  Maybe he was saying that  About something  And he didn't want to let you  In on the details  Because it would have been embarrassing  Like maybe your ass stunk  No I didn't have my ass in his face 
[03:07:30]  I was lying  I was lying on my back  And he said to me  Open your legs a little bit  So I did  And then he said  Now shut them  So I did  And then he said  Now open them again  And I did  Like an accordion  You know  And then he said  Now play with yourself  So I did  And then eventually  You know  And this was quite a long time  I mean  I was thinking about  Cooking my dinner  During most of this  He eventually came  And then he said  Oh god  That was gross  You know  You know  What's that all about?  You know what?  I've still not been able  To work that one out  So what was the problem?

[03:41:30]  For the DVD  But it's already on YouTube  And we got the audio  My boy told us  We're just going to have  Some  Brace fried potatoes  And them tater tots  These for dinner  I didn't see none  Did you?  No  The catering guys  Said there were  Some tater tots  Down in the  In the room  During lunch time  And I kept a few  In my pocket  Then these  Flatheads ate them all  Freaking starving  You still  How about 
[03:42:00]  Llama or that goat  Or whatever you had  There a while ago  You talking about  Tina?  I recognize her name  No  We had to give away  To Lyle the farm  Because her  Milk always tasted  Like hay  And it's  Freaking gross  So  Are you like  Like mentally retarded  Or something?  Yes sir  But  All us mentally retarded  Boys have real big  Peckers  What's a pecker?  Is that like 
[03:42:30]  Some kind of  Bird of prey?  Well  The way the girls  Put it  It's a gargantuan  Penis  Yes sir  I just love  Hearing him do that  Voice  Yeah  Holy shit  Can he say anything  In that voice  Yeah  That was  Slingblade  If you haven't seen  Your girl wanted to see  Slingblade  Did you ever see it?  We rented it  Okay  Did you like it?  We didn't watch it  I rented that  And Gimme Shelter  Oh what's Gimme Shelter?  Documentary  Documentary 
[03:43:00]  Documentary  Rolling Stones  1969  Probably one of the best  Like rock documentaries  Ever  They call it the best  Rock documentary ever  Rules  Better than Song  Remains the Same  And some of the other ones  That came out  But basically  The Stones  Back in 1969  Put on a free show  At Altamont Speedway  Although they pronounced it differently  Altamont  Altamont  Altamont Speedway  Yeah but they pronounced it really weird  In this movie  One of the DJs  Maybe it was a local thing  I don't know  And just amazing  And of course that's when  The Hells Angels 
[03:43:30]  Dude killed the black guy  In the lime green suit  And I didn't realize  They had actual footage  Of the guy getting killed  What was the name of the special  Gimme Shelter?  Gimme Shelter  It's out now?  Nah this has been out forever  Friday  Wide  I can do it on DVD?  Yeah it's been out for  This thing's been out for  I don't know  30 some odd years  69 so whatever  Yeah  Oh  Do the math  Where's Roland?  I don't know  Roland Stones  But what was cool about  The Roland Stones thing  Is like  They set up this stage  I know it's 1969  I get that right 
[03:44:00]  But the security  Was the Hells Angels  They had a couple  Like rock promoters  Good idea  And they had no barrier  So all these tripping kids  Would just try to get on stage  And some of them  Would get on stage  Also Mick Jagger  Singing a song  During this documentary  And a dog walks across  The stage  And they keep stopping  The  You know  Their show  To get people off the stage  So they could continue  And you're thinking  I get it  We're now in the year 2006  But it amazes me  That no one came up  With like a barrier  Back in 1969  A barrier  People that were actually there 
[03:44:30]  Not the Hells Angels  But like security people  That they had no communication  So they really couldn't  Have security teams  And there just wasn't  An industry for it  Back then  It was a rock group  It was supposed to be a concert  It was like  We're not fucking politicians  You know  So  The best part of the movie  They just kind of  Have cameras going around  Where people are hanging out  Waiting for the Stones  To come on stage  And they just picked up  Everyone's just conversation  Of just the most mundane crap  And people like  Talking about how fucked up 
[03:45:00]  They are  And you know  All these just weird little  You know  Parts of little conversations  It's a  No I would see that  I would absolutely see it  It's definitely cool  And then  I forgot what song  They're playing  But then the  The black dude  In the lime green  You know  Like  He had like a suit on  Comes running toward the stage  With a gun  I don't know if he was going  After the Hells Angels guy  Or one of the Stones  I really don't know  What  I mean  How's the story going  I didn't know that  You could see it  Clear as day  And then all of a sudden  This Hells Angels guy  Out of nowhere 
[03:45:30]  You know  He has a knife  But he has this knife  So high  And back over his head  And comes slamming down  On the guy  You could see it  Clear as day  And then they're  Running off screen  And he gets them  One more time in the back  Knows how to sink a knife  And it was like  Four people that died that day  And there were four births  That day  Well I hope the Hells Angels  Didn't get in trouble  I mean if the guy  Is running against someone  With a pistol  He's got to get  Brought down  Well it's a legendary story  But I didn't realize  They actually had the video  Of the guy getting stabbed  I don't know  Isn't that where Mick  Walks out for Sympathy  Of the Devil  Wearing like the long cape  Well then they like  It's really cool footage 
[03:46:00]  Well they spliced it  Into like a Madison Square Garden  Show they were doing as well  Around that time  But uh  Oh look at that  Meredith Hunter  Yes  Meredith Hunter  18 year old African American  Meredith is a guy  Back then  He was called a Negro  Let me see his picture  Jesus  A Negro gentleman  With a girl's name  Really  What's his name  Meredith 
[03:46:30]  Meredith Hunter  That is a girl's name  Yeah  Anyway  He was running  With the gun  And they said  He was yelling  Something that sounded  Like  Oh okay  But I rented that  With Sling Blade  And I'm going to watch  That probably today  Finally  I haven't seen that  In years  Let's say hi to  Josh in Pennsylvania  Josh  Hey how you doing guys  Hey  Hi fella  What's up  I actually saw that video  Probably like  Three or four years ago  And it was actually  One of the most 
[03:47:00]  Out of control things  That I've absolutely  Ever seen  What video  The guy is running  Oh okay  Say that again  I know what you meant  Now I know  I'm sorry  And the guy like  I guess I'm  Probably not answering  Who the hell knows  He runs out of nowhere  Into  Like approaching the stage  With a gun  I would just say  And one of the  Hells Angels  Just comes out of nowhere  And almost like  Stabs him in the chest  Cause he was going  To shoot Mick Jagger  That's what they said  Like  Cause people were freaking out  Are they trying to say  He was going after Jagger  Is that the official story  I don't even know 
[03:47:30]  Well it looks to me then  I said I started  Looks to me like  The Hells Angels  Were a fine choice  For security  Yeah right  Regular security  Wouldn't have done anything  They took care of the problem  Immediately  That's it  You run with a gun  You get stabbed  Fuck off  Right  That was a fine choice  That's the way it should be  Yeah  And was it in the middle  Of Sympathy for the Devil  I believe so  I mean I was pretty high  At the time  But I mean  The guy was 18 years old  Then they got these guys  So fucked up  On the side of the stage  Or on the stage  And they show Mick Jagger  Like singing  And the looks 
[03:48:00]  These guys were giving Mick Jagger  It was so creepy  How many people were there  And you could see  The fear on Mick Jagger's face  Like what the hell  Did we get ourselves into  How did we get out of here  Yeah  How many people were there  At the concert  Well that was the problem  Because they knew  Right off the bat  This was a bad scene  300,000 people  So they couldn't just  Not do the concert  At that point  Because it would just  Be an all out riot  So  One of the dudes  From Jefferson Airplane  I forgot which one  Got punched in the face  By one of the Hells Angels  Guys during his set  Why?  You gotta rent the movie  It's amazing  Because the Hells Angels 
[03:48:30]  Especially back then  Really weren't security guards  You didn't hire them  To work security  And be rational about it  Although you know  Getting the guy with the gun  If he was gonna shoot Mick  Hey  He did a great job  Mick owes him  You know  Now Mick probably owes him  For the rest of their existence  But you know  You don't hire the Hells Angels  To go  Excuse me sir  You're acting irrationally  Continue this  We're gonna have to  Ask you to leave  It's  You get  A pull cue 
[03:49:00]  Across your face  I gotta tell you man  We really enjoyed the movie  Because  And then  Because the times  Are just different  Then all of a sudden  There's just this big  Huge  Naked fat guy  Just so comfortable  With his fatness  And his nakedness  Nakedness  Just hanging out  Watching this show  I wanna interview  A Hells Angel  Let's go to Joe in Jersey  Can we do that  Interview one of the Hells Angels  Yeah  Can you do that  At your house  Where you wanna do it  Yeah why not  I mean he doesn't have to  Give his real name  That'd be interesting  Who's there  This here  Why not 
[03:49:30]  Yeah right  I wouldn't fuck with him  It'd be interesting  To hear where these guys live  No thank you  They got the clubhouse  Down here in Manhattan  They still got the clubhouse  Down here in Manhattan  Yeah I hear there's no drugs  Or anything on that block  They fucking take care of business  Like Gotti's old block  Right  They don't fuck around  They don't fuck around  Down there  I'd love to live  I'd like to live on that block  Except for the fact  They'd probably fuck every girl  I brought home  And I could say nothing about it  You could do nothing  Hey send her in  Alright sir  Like Saddam used to be  With Iraq  You know fuck with him  Yeah  Take him out  Not his problems  I wanna interview one on the air 
[03:50:00]  Oh god yeah  Hyman Roth  Another great scene  Remember the scene  With the broad  Walking around  Trying to collect money  To eliminate  Or even kill members  Of the Black Panther Party  And a black guy  Put money in it  Tapless  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey  Joe  Collecting for the tapless  How do you do Joe  How do you do  They were playing  Simply for the Devil  When that happened  They didn't play it live  For like 10 years after that  Oh yeah  Some people were saying  The song was actually  Under my thumb  When he got stabbed  Oh  They didn't play it 
[03:50:30]  For like 10 years live  After that  Because it was a big deal  And they played it again  I like the way that  Ope kind of corrected you  And you still barreled through  With your version  Oh yeah  He's not taking any  You're a good boy Joe  You had a ramrod hat on  And you ran right  Through the fucking door  No stopping with Ope facts  I don't know for sure  But a lot of people  Are instant feedbacking  Brian in Niagara Falls  Contrary to popular belief  Meredith Hunter  Was not killed  During the performance  Of Sympathy for the Devil  He was actually stabbed  Just as the Rolling Stones  Started the first verse  Of Under My Thumb  That's right  Have they just finished 
[03:51:00]  Sympathy  I need the set list  From that evening  In it's entirety  You know how they got  The Stones to the stage  Motorcycles  Right through the middle  Of the crowd  And they show  The Hells Angels guys  Coming to the stage  With their bikes  Just chugging wine  And stuff  Just getting completely  Fucked up  How many angels  Were there  A lot  I don't know  I know  I know  It's a dumb thing to say  But probably  At least in the hundreds  Supposedly they were 
[03:51:30]  Paid $500  Of beer  And were extremely  F'd up  They probably came  From all over  They got fucking chapters  They probably brought in  A whole shitload of chapters  They probably had  The guys that were  Listen to us  Probably  Probably  Probably  They probably  Were from space  And landed in UFOs  What the fuck  Do we know  We really are speculating  Just by us  Idiots  That's why  I'd like to talk  To a guy  That was  That older guy  That was around  At that time  That was great  At the end of the show  They show  Them trying to get  Everybody in the helicopter  ASAP  And getting out of there  And just like 
[03:52:00]  The road manager  Or whatever  Some of the stones  People are like  Come on  Come on  Come on  Just freaking out  Like let's get  The hell out of here  Why do they hang out  And meet and greet  Like we do  Yeah sign  Sign for the crowd  Sell shirts  Look you know  I put on a green suit  And all I got  Was this lousy knife  Let's go to  John in Cleveland  John  Hey Oak  What's going on  Hey there Jan  Hey my dad  Was a member  Of H.A.  Back when  The whole  Altamont thing  Happened  Yeah  And actually  Mick Jagger  And Sonny Berger  Hate each other  To this very day 
[03:52:30]  Why  Because of what  Happens  Mick blamed  Everything on  The Hells Angels  Who they hired  For security  And they wanted  A peaceful  Demonstration  Didn't want  Anybody to get  Hurt  Then why would  You hire  The Hells Angels  And like  The next day  Mick Jagger  Went on the air  Talking all  This shit about  The Hells Angels  And stuff  And to this  Very day  They hate each  Other  Was it the  Stones  Was it like  Mick and them  That hired them  Or was it  Somebody you know  Back in the 60's  It was cool  The Grateful Dead 
[03:53:00]  Hired them too  For security  Everybody used to  Hire the Hells Angels  Because it was the  Cool thing to do  Somebody who was  A member of the  Hells Angels  Allegedly told a  Story to a  Friend of mine  Like a very  High ranking  Member of the  Hells Angels  He's I think  Retired now  Or he's not  Involved  Said years ago  That Jerry  Garcia had a  Guy who looked  Like him  That was raping  Women  And  People that  Looked just like  Jerry Garcia  I wonder how  This ends  Well apparently  And again  I have to say  Allegedly  I don't know  But my friend  Told me that  The guy told him  Could be legend  That we got a 
[03:53:30]  Hold of him  And  Cause it was  Ladies in the  Area  And he goes  Well I don't  Want to say  What happened  But let's just  Say he never  Did that again  Oh shit  Sounds to me  Like they took  Care of business  Wow  They don't fuck  Around with  A whole lot  Of lawyer talk  No  Are you doing that  Give me those  Balls  Let me cut them  Off  There you go  Go home sir  Let's go to  Tom in California  Tom  Hey guys  How you doing  Hey  Hey  I've heard that  Story fucking 
[03:54:00]  A hundred times  And I've never  Heard  How come you  Never heard  From the media  The guy had  A gun  Ever  I have no idea  The song was  The song was  Sympathy for the  Shwoogie  Wow  He  No it wasn't  It was under  My opposable thumb  That's the joke sir  Oh  Is he gonna go there  And yes  Gumby  Go ahead  Gumby  Hey  From what I 
[03:54:30]  Understand  It was at the  End of the  Summer of 67  Which was the  Summer of love  And from what I  Understand  That was the  Death of the  Hippies  That's right  Yeah  Yeah well  I still saw  A few of them  When I was a  Kid back in  The early 70's  A few of the  Hippies left  Yuck  Dirty hippies  Glad they're  An extinct  Thing  Whatever  I don't mind  The unshaved  Armpits though  I want the pussy  To be fucking  Shaved smooth  As the day  You were born  But under the

[04:01:30]  Let's  Let's  Let's 
[04:02:00]  Let's  Let's  My brother is taking that on, and I don't know.  He's going to be there, like, emceeing, like, our listener is trying to be the funniest pest or something.  I think it's a week from Saturday, I think.  From...  I'm tired.  A week from Saturday, I think.  Saturday.  Maybe Brother Elmo could call, like, tomorrow or something with the details.  But, yes, my brother's restaurant is excellent.  F.H. Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village. 
[04:02:30]  Stop by and say hi and blah, blah, blah.  I'm tired.  What?  I'm tired.  What?  I'm sleepy.  Well, sleep.  I'm sleepy.  Sleepy.  I want to put my head on my pillow.  Sleepy.  It has a winged fairy embroidered on it, so I put my head in fairy dust.  And an unwinged one's head laying on it.  Winged fairy. 
[04:03:00]  I put my head in fairy dust when I want to sleep.  And it sprinkles on me.  I dream that I'm eating lemon flowers and gumdrop turds.  I dream that a primordial dwarf is shitting gumdrops into my mouth.  That's how I sleep.  I make this, I make it straddle my mouth and it makes little gumdrop poops and his little  feet kick around my cheeks. 
[04:03:30]  Little feet scraping my unshaven cheeks.  As I eat his little gumdrop duties, they taste like peppermint.  How are you doing, Jimmy?  I think so.  I'm getting silly.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up Factory.  Making the Fruit Roll-Up. 
[04:04:00]  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that are so much better than your American.  Because I, you know, what do you, let me just, well, you already know, but.  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad and it stunk so bad.  You fat American.  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know. 
[04:04:30]  Okay, back to work. </pre>
