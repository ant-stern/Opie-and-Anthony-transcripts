<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly critical, and often misogynistic, commentary on the Democratic National Convention (DNC). Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton dissected the news networks' coverage, praising C-SPAN's raw feed while lambasting MSNBC and CNN for perceived bias and excessive commentary.  Their critique extended to specific speakers, with Mayor Menino's mumbling speech becoming a recurring punchline, Bill Clinton's speech receiving unexpected praise for its naturalness, and Sandra Fluke's appearance and speech drawing significant, derogatory criticism.  The hosts also commented on Obama's speaking style, the convention's handling (or lack thereof) of religious themes, and Michelle Obama's appearance and her brother's resemblance to RuPaul.  A caller, Stunt Brain, provided a live report from the DNC, detailing lavish parties for donors and the logistical challenges of the event.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Obama's presidency and the hosts' personal preferences regarding women's physical attributes.

The discussion then heavily revisited Mayor Menino's DNC speech, playing numerous audio clips to emphasize his verbal stumbles and the audience's lack of reaction. This segment was punctuated by highly offensive language and several humorous tangents: one host recounted a dream about Ted Danson being president, another described a bizarre dream involving a jetliner, and office gossip about employees taking vacations before potential firings surfaced, alongside a nonsensical “montage” suggestion and a discussion of an extreme hoarder.

Next, the show shifted to viral content: a listener-submitted video of a Russian subway performer accurately singing Nirvana songs despite the language barrier; a near-miss scooter accident; a video of a mother duck and her ducklings crossing a busy highway; and a children’s song with profane lyrics.  They also reacted to Tom Brokaw-related news (details unspecified), a video of someone falling asleep on a moving scooter, and Queen Latifah's rendition of the national anthem. This segment further included a scathing review of the movie "Hop," interspersed with discussions of fantasy football and the hosts' personal obsessions.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and reacting to famous sports rants, including Bobby Valentine, Earl Weaver (a fabricated clip revealed later), Lee Elia, and Hal McCray's outbursts, all delivered with copious amounts of offensive language.

The show then segued into a chaotic mix of segments.  It began with an unintelligible argument, likely between sports personalities, followed by a commercial for Jim Norton's "Guide to Jersey City Prostitution," featuring explicit anecdotes.  This transitioned to a discussion about Apple stock and a previously aired, intense interview with an unnamed sports figure, followed by reminiscences about a high school science teacher with the memorable name "Buttcabbage" (later misremembered as "Cockbroccoli").  A lengthy discussion about the Voyager 1 spacecraft, its distance from Earth, signal travel time, and its antiquated technology followed, incorporating speculation about extraterrestrial life and irreverent commentary on the speed of light and Einstein's theories.  The show returned to Boston Mayor Menino's poor speaking skills, interspersed with listener calls,  Jim Norton promoting his comedy shows, and a celebration of Sam Roberts' birthday with an ice cream cake, which he refused to eat. The segment concluded with discussions surrounding Sam’s birthday, the interns, and a bizarre voicemail from Dr. Steve.

The final segment focused on Sam Roberts' birthday, featuring a birthday cake and two interns, Anthony and Julie, in the studio. Anthony shared his Disney World internship experience, including a near-heart attack incident. Julie, an NYU film student, discussed her internship aspirations.  The conversation touched upon potential intern contributions to the show (like man-on-the-street segments), with frequent mentions of Roland and his perceived lack of participation.  The hosts also discussed a call from Stump Brain, at the DNC. The segment ended with task assignments for the interns and thanks to the staff, laced with usual off-color jokes and a recurring "penis dough" reference by Roland.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, asshole, just take the joke and take a little beating. 
[00:04:30]  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the Rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock, I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guard, I'm just going to beat the show. 
[00:05:00]  And we will.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I really like our opener.  That was funny.  Pretty much a letdown after that, but I love the opener.  Yeah, it's all downhill from here.  Fuck.  Doesn't put too much pressure on you.  Sucks when you really have to try to beat the opener.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Well, I'm learning something about the DNC.  Yeah.  I'm learning that all Republicans suck. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And they're pretty much the devil.  Evil, evil people.  And as human beings, we should not listen to a word they say.  How could you?  They're the devil incarnate.  And, of course, the RNC did the exact same thing about the DNC people.  Yeah.  Fucking annoying, man.  But the Democrats are gentle, loving, caring people.  They're ugly people.  The Republicans are these giant chrome tower type corporate faceless entities. 
[00:06:00]  The DNC?  Not a good looking bunch.  No.  No.  Kind of goofy looking.  You'd think, like, you'd get a lot of these young, hot looking girls and stuff like that.  A lot of fat women.  Yeah.  I've been watching these delegates, the convention.  I watched the convention probably more than anybody else the past couple of days on, wow,  that powerhouse of a station, C-SPAN.  I went to C-SPAN because of your tweet.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Because I'm like, I don't want to watch news people talking about the DNC.  Exactly.  I'd rather watch it for myself.  And they cut out some of the fun videos.  And there's always speakers in the background.  You're like, what the fuck is that guy saying?  What are you saying?  Why do you feel like you're more important than the actual person speaking at the DNC?  Thank you.  Holy fuck!  There's no commentary at all.  All it is is, on C-SPAN, they just have fucking cameras and they show the people speaking.  Right.  That's it.  They show the videos.  They show everything.  But these assholes on MSNBC, I was doing MSNBC and CNN for the most part. 
[00:07:00]  They're like, no.  What I have to say is way more important than that dummy on the stage at the DNC.  I know they're not the headliners, but still.  It's infuriating.  And Fox does it, too.  You know, they're yapping as you see somebody in the background.  It's like, all right, this might not be one of the stellar fucking people in the background.  They're just horrible news organizations.  Because if you know anything about Mayor Menino, you want him on your fucking channel.  He was...  And I didn't even know he was talking because I saw your tweet. 
[00:07:30]  I'm like, well, 535 C-SPAN.  Thank you, Anthony Cumia.  535 C-SPAN.  No one else showed his speech.  No one covered it.  And it was brilliant, I must say.  Mayor Menino's speech.  You know his mayor, a bastard.  He is the epitome of the Boston accent.  He's like, even people with Boston accents go, wow, that really sounds silly.  And then he just mumbled.  It was a chore.  I was on the edge of my seat watching just him stumble. 
[00:08:00]  But you root for the guy.  You do kind of root for him.  I mean, I guess he's a powerful politician, but you root for him like you're watching your son at Little League or something.  You don't want your son to strike out.  And there he is, like, is he going to make it through the speech?  And on the heels of them throwing him off that flight from American Airlines the other day.  That giant tongue of his.  He's another guy that looks like an adult trainable.  It almost looked like when he walked out that he was falling into the curtain first. 
[00:08:30]  He put his hand up.  And something's going on with him.  Yeah, isn't it odd?  I don't know what's going on with him.  I think something's going on.  And then he just.  He only talked for six minutes?  That was it?  No.  Yeah, they all.  That's a long six minutes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  I thought I was watching him for a half hour.  And he was dragging things out and trying for these dramatic pauses that just seemed like he was forgetting what he was saying.  He's not a good speaker.  No, he's terrible.  He's awful.  A couple other observations.  Do you have a broad in this thing? 
[00:09:00]  A broad.  You know, all the networks, they have to have the good looking broads.  Well, like I said.  And the good looking broads think they're on TV because they have knowledge.  But the fact is, we all know you're there because you're a hot piece of ass.  You know what?  Like I said, that C-span.  Oh, boy.  I'm not.  There's no one covering it.  There's just they show the raw feed.  I think her name is Monica Crowley.  Oh, Monica Crowley, the blonde.  No, no, no.  Monica Crowley looks like Shrek.  Wait a minute.  I thought she's a blonde. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, wait.  Who am I thinking of then?  Fuck.  No, that's Monica Crowley.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Monica Crowley.  Okay.  She makes my point the other way.  The only reason she's on TV is because she's a hot piece of ass.  Oh, she thinks she might be knowledgeable and has some intelligence.  But that's just not true.  Because the broad that is the smartest out of all of them looks like a fucking pig.  She's heinous.  So they usually, when she talks, she's in the distance.  You know those reporters that are kind of in the distance?  Oh, they put them away.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is her name?  Shit. 
[00:10:00]  I thought it was Monica something or, uh, uh, uh, fuck.  Someone will get it.  Let me see.  What is she?  What station is she on?  I think she does MSNBC.  Oh.  She wants to be, uh, you know, the smart broad like you're talking about.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the related searches for her also come up as Monica Crowley hot.  Yeah.  And Monica Crowley legs.  Oh, yeah.  And if you want to continue searching for Monica Crowley on Google, other stuff comes up  like, uh, Monica Crowley feet.  Yeah.  Monica Crowley boyfriend.  Yeah.  So keep going with your, uh, legitimacy. 
[00:10:30]  And if you throw a bikini in there, you know, they do try to find bikini pictures of all  these, uh, broads.  Andrea Mitchell.  Andrea Mitchell is brutal looking too.  She's brutal.  No, man.  This one is, um, she's got, uh, brown hair.  She doesn't even try.  It looks like she doesn't even shampoo her hair.  Uh, she's a bit overweight.  Man.  And she's butt ugly.  Andrea Mitchell's another one of these women that look like Dr. Smith with a wig.  Yeah.  You ever see this one?  Do they really look like Dr.  Zachary Smith with a wig? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Some of these, and she tries to put makeup on and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Help me out, man.  Ah.  She's really bad.  They're trying.  I'm getting no help here.  I mean, she probably deserves a spot, but they can't put her on TV.  She's not good looking enough.  Yeah.  By the way, also Andrea Mitchell, uh, related search.  Andrea Mitchell.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  Why?  Who cares?  My, uh, my broad, because I'm asking you, is Brianna, Brianna something.  Brianna on MSNBC.  Brianna.  Brianna on MSNBC.  Uh, yeah, there you go. 
[00:11:30]  There you go.  Brianna.  But she talks like a dude.  Really?  She's really, she's pretty good looking.  Like deep voice dude, or?  Uh, Keeler, I think.  Brianna Keeler.  Is that up in the search?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like she's, um, not her.  Everyone else is looking at Brianna Keeler.  You know how I knew it was her before the images came up?  Because the related searches were the same.  Legs, feet, hot.  Husband, hot. 
[00:12:00]  Is she pretty?  She's all right.  Oh, yeah, she's all right.  She's all right, but she has a, she has a, she has a man's voice.  Really?  That takes you out of the fucking game, man.  You don't have a broad.  No, I've been watching this, uh, sans, um, editorializing.  Yes.  Yes, I like it that way.  You get, uh, to make your own decisions on these people.  And believe it or not, uh, you know, I, I don't think everything with the convention  is completely horrible and wrong and nasty and, uh, well. 
[00:12:30]  Sorry, because, because it's going to drive me and certainly some listeners nuts.  Thank you.  Candy.  Her first name is Candy.  Candy Crowley.  Candy Crowley.  Okay, thank you.  Wait, so there's a Monica Crowley and a Candy Crowley?  Candy Crowley.  Candy Crowley.  Candy Crowley.  Yes, oh God, that, that fucking heifer.  Like, she.  Wow.  Probably is the smartest out of all the broads on TV, but you just can't give her a spot.  Her name is Robert Paulson.  Her name is Robert Paulson. 
[00:13:00]  Candy Crowley.  Ooh, what a disaster.  You know, I know, I know parents like to come up with the cute names for their girls and stuff.  Oh, they were hoping.  But, you know, when you grow up and realize you're not a Candy, you might want to change  that name.  Yeah.  What is she?  She's more like a, she's more like a...  Pig?  Yeah.  Yeah, but what...  It's a nickname for what she shoves in her face constantly.  She could be like a Susan.  Susan?  Yeah, you gotta get rid of Candy.  Yeah, Candy ain't working.  There's nothing sweet about ya. 
[00:13:30]  Agnes.  Agnes.  Agnes.  Bertha.  Yeah.  Helga.  That's a good one, too.  Helga.  She's a Helen.  But anyway, I just laugh because I look at these really good looking women on these  new shows.  You're there because you're good to look at.  That's it.  Yeah.  It must really speak for how good she is on the air because why would you put her on  Cam?  Candy Crowley?  Look at the fucking lookalike takes. 
[00:14:00]  I was thinking more Shrek.  Wow, she's awful.  Doctor Who villain?  What is that?  I don't know.  Oh, no, that's Hitchhiker's Guide.  Yeah, there's a great site called Totally Looks Like, and it just picks one against another.  This one is Candy Crowley, looks like the Hitchhiker's Guide alien.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, anyway, you weren't dealing with that nonsense.  You went right to C-SPAN.  Yeah, you know, Danny typed up that thing.  It said you're officially old when you're crowing about the C-SPAN. 
[00:14:30]  All right, when you start talking about how awesome C-SPAN is, you're a fucking old man,  dude.  Yeah.  I was being a tad sarcastic when I talk about the excitement that is C-SPAN.  At least you could see the DNC.  Yeah, you know what it is.  Like, these guys are doing around-the-clock coverage, but they don't show anybody actually  speaking until prime time.  No, they show...  Or every once in a while, they'll show a little taste.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to see some of the lower echelon of Democratic speakers.  That's what I want to see.  And I saw them, boy. 
[00:15:00]  I clicked in, and wow, some people cannot really do this well.  They come up to speak, and they're not good public speakers.  And you can tell it's their big moment.  Yeah.  So they're trying hard, and they must be thinking, I'm ready to run into 2016.  It's my year.  My year.  And they're just not good at it.  No.  They do that thing where, at the end, they try to rev everybody up, and we are going  to take one.  Oh, that doesn't mean what you're doing. 
[00:15:30]  What you're saying is good.  That dramatic buildup where it ends with, and God bless the United States of America!  God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!  Thank you!  And remember, vote for Barack Obama!  All right.  The yelling.  And didn't the Democrats get shit for keeping God out of it at first, and then they brought  him back, and people were booing?  Yes, people booed.  I kind of like that they kept God out of it.  People boo God.  It's hilarious.  There's some controversy over that.  Boo!  Supposedly, they were booing over the actual process that was going down. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  There's some tremendous hypocrisies going on.  I don't know.  On both sides.  On both sides.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Just add that every once in a while, please.  I ain't even going to front.  I'll tell you.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, though.  I don't want to argue his points.  I just want to say that Clinton, holy fuck, the guy knows how to speak.  That was a home run for the Democrats last night.  Like you said before the show, you don't feel like he's giving a speech.  No.  Obviously, you know, he knows what he's going to talk about, and probably most of it's written 
[00:16:30]  down there for him.  Yeah.  But he is just such a natural at it.  You just feel like he's up there winging it the whole time, and when he makes his points,  it doesn't seem like he's just towing the party line, which he is.  I don't get any illusions, but it comes off so natural with him.  He engages you.  He's good-natured.  He's good at engaging the person.  He puts that little laugh in where it doesn't seem like I've seen all these other politicians  giving these speeches. 
[00:17:00]  They get up, and it seems so phony.  And I know he's just as phony, but it just comes natural to him.  And he uses his eyes.  Oh, well.  Now, hear me.  That's how he got that blow job.  What did he say last night?  Now, hear me.  Hear me, right?  Motherfuckers.  Now, listen to me right now.  Yeah.  But he does it with the eye, and you're like, oh, I better listen.  Now, listen to me right now.  Oh, I better listen.  But he wasn't doing, someone pointed out to me last night, that he wasn't doing that  fist with the thumb thing.  He was pointing a lot.  That's Daryl Hammond's thing.  I know. 
[00:17:30]  No, Clinton used to do that.  I don't know.  I think maybe Clinton did it once, and then Daryl Hammond decided, I'm going to go with  this.  Yeah.  Daryl Hammond definitely did it.  And the lip bite.  Yeah, yeah.  But he just looked really presidential.  He looks really healthy, too.  For a while there, he wasn't looking good, man.  He makes sense out of things for people.  I think that's why people like him.  There's something about Clinton where he just makes sense of things.  Look at that look.  There's the look.  See?  He knows how to use his eyes.  He makes the little slit eyes, and then he turns his head, and he, ugh. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Like, hey, hey, listen up here.  This is important.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know what?  Again, the party of women, the party of women respecting women, and they bring up the guy  that had an intern sucking his dick in the most sacred of offices in Washington.  Hey, man, enough time has gone by.  I know.  Enough time has gone by.  That's it.  What are you going to do?  That's it.  You are right.  You are right.  And the women are cheering this guy. 
[00:18:30]  That just shows you how much charisma this guy has.  Oh, yeah.  Because he, you know, a few years go by and he skates.  No one gives a fuck.  It's how charismatic he is.  He was the president at the time.  How fucking phony these women in the audience are, where they take any opportunity to talk  about how the other party is horrible to women, yet this guy treated a woman like a fuck  toy, shoving a cigar in her pussy, and getting blowjobs while Arafat waited outside, and they 
[00:19:00]  love him.  I like that he's pointing.  Oh, you like the point?  I like it better than that stupid neutral.  Yes, yes, yes.  Because now he doesn't have to get votes.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care if he looks a little bit in your face.  It doesn't matter.  How does pointing look on the polls?  Right.  He can care less.  Don't point.  He's pointing a lot now.  Point with your thumb.  Yeah.  You know that thing you shoved up Monica's asshole?  Point with that.  Why is Norman's mother on that?  Norman?  Norman?  Yeah, yeah.  They got all our TVs on, sorry.  Ugly ass, frumpy women coming up and giving speeches last night. 
[00:19:30]  I'm a fan of good looking people.  Oh, man.  Who isn't, right?  I love looking at good looking people.  That really is a Norman Bates mommy.  Wig.  Yeah, it really is, right?  Holy shit.  Hey, um, what's her name?  Sarah Fluke?  Oh, that fucking...  Sandra Fluke.  Sandra.  Sandra.  Sandra Fluke.  Sandra, right.  Sandra Fluke.  Was she there?  Oh, she spoke.  Spoke.  Why?  Oh, because she's a woman that needs...  It is my opinion.  It is my opinion.  She cares about that talk. 
[00:20:00]  She is batshit crazy.  She is.  She comes off as a lunatic.  That is my opinion.  A lunatic.  Her speech was good.  Well, she was wearing a necklace made of cock rings.  Did you see that?  It was beautiful.  Oh, boy.  Big cock ring necklace.  She was up there yapping about how, of course, the Republicans want to set back women's rights  and stop abortions and stop everything.  And Obama is fantastic.  And actually, Obama will perform abortions for women.  If you need.  You go to the White House and he will... 
[00:20:30]  He's got a little table there.  He's so into abortions that he's opening up a little...  Right in the Oval Office, as a matter of fact.  You sit on the desk in the Oval Office, the same desk that little John John used to  play under, and you hike your legs up and Obama takes the official vacuum with a presidential  seal on it and just sucks that fetus out.  Nice.  Doesn't matter.  Third trimester, he don't give a shit.  She looks like Rob Thomas, actually.  Sandra Fluke.  She's not an attractive woman. 
[00:21:00]  She...  Yeah.  You know, but she seems like she is fucking batshit crazy.  Crazy.  Do we have any of her speech?  Yeah.  Crazy woman.  I don't know.  Her speech was very rambling.  Just went on and on.  Yeah.  But Michelle Obama was...  She was saying that it was a good speech.  I was reading her lips.  I wasn't feeling it.  I was reading her lips.  I was phasing out of her speech.  I was reading Michelle Obama's brother.  It had to be next to her. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, her brother's a big, tall, bald guy, right?  Yeah.  It kind of looks like Sheila on the face.  I was reading Michelle Obama without a wig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I would assume Michelle Obama might have a wig or two.  Actually, her brother looks like...  What's his name?  Without the tranny makeup on.  Oh.  RuPaul?  Yeah.  RuPaul without the tranny makeup on.  We saw RuPaul when I was in L.A. last time.  Oh, did you?  Well, you know.  We were eating a Chipotle.  What's that?  Chipotle's rule.  It's phenomenal.  It's fresh food. 
[00:22:00]  I love Chipotle's.  And she was right behind.  Actually, he was Ray.  He was dressed as a guy.  It was Ru.  Yeah.  He had his big glasses on.  Yeah.  And he's unshaven.  Like nobody...  It was kind of funny.  Jonathan recognized him.  I didn't.  And nobody knew who he was.  Wow.  Unshaven and everything?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He goes through life like that.  Yeah.  Like a man.  It's smart.  Like a sort of man.  You can live like that and no one knows who you are.  You can go do all your personal stuff and no one will bother you.  No one even bothers you.  No one even looked.  Yeah.  You got a good part of her speech? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, no.  Not necessarily.  It was pretty dull.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact.  Yeah.  We don't even have to waste time on it.  She was talking for the women out there and she just seems like she would fucking kill  you.  How long was her speech?  With a frying pan.  She was up there for longer than a lot of the people.  A while.  Six and a half?  That's only six and a half minutes I heard.  Oh, really?  A real speech.  Everyone got like six and a half minutes.  Yeah, I know.  Some of the people seem to go by very quickly.  Others, not so much.  Clinton, how long?  Clinton was a long time. 
[00:23:00]  How long?  49 minutes.  49 minutes.  49 fucking minutes.  Wow.  We got some highlights.  Keynote address.  You want to hear his highlights?  Yeah.  I'd love to.  Highlights.  Yeah.  I like him pointing.  I like that better than neutral thumb.  He's a pointing motherfucker.  I gotta say.  Very natural, though.  He came off.  We are here.  We're queer.  We're fine.  Let's get used to it.  And I've got one in mind. 
[00:23:30]  His voice is a little scratchy.  I want to nominate a man whose own life has known its fair share of adversity.  Really?  And uncertainty.  An Ivy League fucking...  I want to nominate a man who ran for president to change the course of an already weak economy.  And then just six weeks before his election saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the  Great Depression.  Oh.  A man who stopped the slide into depression. 
[00:24:00]  Well.  And put us on the long road to recovery.  Long road.  Knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs that he saved or created, there'd still  be millions more waiting, worried about feeding their own kids, trying to keep their hopes  alive.  Alive.  I want to nominate a man who's cool on the outside.  Is he cool?  I don't think Obama is cool. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I don't think so.  We've said it many times.  He's a nerd.  Yeah.  I was reading about his meltdown when him and John Bonner, remember they almost, or  Boner ordered his name, when they almost reached that agreement and it fell, Boehner,  I'm sorry.  And it fell apart at the last minute.  There was, they said that he was calling Boehner all day and he couldn't get him on  the phone.  And people said that they, he was fucking human.  Oh, man.  But he got greedy.  He asked for too much money.  Boehner was going to give like 800 million. 
[00:25:00]  I think he wanted 1.2 trillion and it fell apart.  Yeah.  Which is Obama's mistake.  But who burns for America on the inside.  I want, I want a man who believes with no doubt that we can build a new American dream  economy driven by innovation and creativity, by education and yes, by cooperation.  And by the way, after last night, I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michelle 
[00:25:30]  Obama.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Tickle the ass.  Tickle that ample ass.  But everybody knows if Obama wasn't the president, Clinton could probably fuck her.  Oh, yeah.  He can't because Obama's the president.  So he can't alpha male Obama.  I'll alpha male you.  If Obama was anybody but the president, she could have gotten them.  Hips and just start fucking away on that one. 
[00:26:00]  Dude, there's no, no matter who your girl, like he could just walk in and fuck a chick.  It's what he, he's that guy.  I never liked giant broads.  No?  No, man.  She is a big broad.  She's a big, man.  She's a big broad.  Not fat, just big.  She got giant hips.  Just giant.  Giant hips.  Wow.  Not my type.  Too intimidating.  Too intimidating for the opester.  The opester.  See, that's the kind that you don't try to knock the pussy out of the fucking back. 
[00:26:30]  You just kind of, no.  You just got to kind of be embraced by it.  Like, she's much bigger.  Let her wrap her big, long legs around you.  And you reach under and hold her hiney like a baby boy.  That would be nice.  I like a nice, big, tall girl being drowned in it.  I don't understand.  And there's a lot of guys out there.  I know Jimmy has dated women that are taller than him.  Thank you for phrasing it like that.  I don't understand.  I don't understand going out with a woman or marrying a woman that just has bigger clothes 
[00:27:00]  than you.  Oh, man.  To me, that's just weird.  Yeah.  Is that bad?  To think?  To put on, like, her pants and you have room.  And you feel...  You're like, whoa, this is roomy, roomy.  Dude, you're big, though.  My ex-girlfriend used to have to get...  This is when...  She would hide candy in the top shelf.  I never knew it was there.  Oh.  Like, so if she didn't want me...  Because she was skinny and I wasn't.  She was tall than you.  Yeah, she was like 5'9".  Yeah, yeah.  So...  And you're about 5'6".  5'7".  Closer to 5'7", but I'm 5'6". 
[00:27:30]  And she would reach over the top shelf.  And she had to get stuff out of the top shelf for me.  It was great.  Oh, no.  I didn't mind.  But she was 5'9", but most women will throw a heel on her, too.  Oh, yeah.  She was constantly 4'6".  Yes, yes.  She definitely spun heads around when she walked into a room.  But I didn't mind her being bigger than me.  Yeah.  I would try to get something off the shelf and I'd have to call her in.  And she's like, what's the matter?  Short stuff.  I'm like, did you get that for me?  Short stuff.  She'd call me short stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  That's great.  Michelle Obama.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Shut the fuck up.  I want to be president.  I want Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States.  And I proudly nominate him to be the standard bearer of the Democratic Party.  Whoa.  What a surprise that is. 
[00:28:30]  I didn't think they were going to go with him.  Can you imagine if he threw out another name?  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be great.  I nominate Mayor Menino.  What?  The predictability of this whole thing sucks.  It's just that pomp and circumstance that everybody knows what's going to happen.  Remember when the MTV Music Awards, they would have that surprise?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish the DNC would just have some kind of crazy...  No surprises.  Wow.  No one saw that coming.  No surprise.  You could tune in during any one of the speakers.  You could leave the room and then you come back. 
[00:29:00]  And I swore, I thought some of these women that came up were the same woman.  The blue fucking smart suit.  The chopped off, unattractive, easily manageable gray hair.  They all got that fucking goddamn Jamie Lee Curtis shit yogurt commercial hair.  Shit yogurt.  Shit yogurt.  And they're all saying the same exact thing.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[00:29:30]  Well, we got a lot of Clinton.  You want to...  He praises Obama for supporting Hillary.  Sure.  Thank you for giving my wife a job that keeps her away from me.  We don't need...  Yeah.  He gave her a job where she travels the world.  Puts her half a world away.  Let's me do what I do.  She's home 100 days a year, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe.  She's always spanning the globe and he just walks around being Bill Clint.  Mm-hmm.  It's got to be great. 
[00:30:00]  Someone's quoted me as saying, I think Sandra Fluke is batshit crazy.  Because I don't know.  She comes off as batshit crazy.  It's my humble opinion.  In my humble opinion.  That's what should be added to that.  I can definitely say from what I've seen, she comes off as batshit crazy.  She scares me.  And also, what is batshit crazy?  It's, you know, I don't think she could sue for batshit crazy.  You know, the thing is this.  She's a hero because of just something a radio guy said about her.  That's why she's in the...  I know she represents something and she's symbolic of something, mistreatment of women. 
[00:30:30]  But just Rush Limbaugh says something about her.  That's why she's known.  She's the Joe the Plumber person.  Yeah, exactly.  Every few years you need one of those people.  Yeah.  Joe the Dumb Plumber.  Remember how they kept talking?  Everyone kept talking about Joe the Plumber.  And then he ran for something and nobody cares about him?  No one cares.  They throw him on TV every once in a while.  He piped up about gun control after the shootings.  He's a dork.  Oh, after the Empire State Building shooting.  Oh, really? 
[00:31:00]  He piped up about that.  This is why I think Obama might have a little more of a problem than people are thinking.  Because, especially young people, people that like to go out and vote for idealistic candidates, they have a hard time sticking with a cause.  Remember Coney?  Remember that whole thing?  So, I'm thinking you're not going to get that turnout of young white voters, which is predominantly who put Obama in the White House, coming out because this isn't a real exciting first black president, hope, change kind of situation. 
[00:31:30]  So, I don't think that voter turnout is going to be as high as it was for him at the beginning of his first time.  It's going to come down to Ohio.  Ohio.  Cowboys won.  So close to Ohio.  Cowboys won, huh?  Are the Cowboys supposed to be good this year? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  I don't even know.  You should know.  It's sort of your team, Jimmy.  You don't know?  Do they know where I'm working next week?  Are any of the Cowboys coming to see me in Addison?  Fuckers.  Fuck them.  You're going to Addison next weekend?  No, no, but I'm saying when I do it, I'm in Irvine next week, but no one cares.  But Cowboys beat the Giants at home.  That's pretty impressive.  I saw part of it.  I was out to dinner.  I saw it on the TV.  I was like, yeah, it was kind of good to see them doing well, but if they're having a good season, I'll watch more, but I just don't give a shit.  Good season.  It's all about the J-E-T-S. 
[00:32:30]  Jets, Jets, Jets.  People asking Jets or Giants.  Jets.  Jets.  I've said it a million times.  And I don't like that we have Tebow.  So it's fun to watch him, but not when he's on your team.  We'll see.  You want Bill telling America to vote for Obama?  Why not?  He talks about how Obama saved the auto industry.  Well, yeah.  Did he?  You want to hear that?  I'm asking you guys, though.  Is what he did right for the auto industry? 
[00:33:00]  I think it was.  I think it was.  People seem to like it.  Yeah.  That's another one of the points I was making last night was the fact that I'm not completely  against everything Obama has done.  And there's two schools of thought there.  Some would say, you know, maybe it is good to let it fucking fail.  Right, right.  And see what comes next.  But a lot of these auto workers, especially, were being paraded up there and saying, hey,  you know, we have jobs here and we wouldn't have had he not bailed out that industry. 
[00:33:30]  But then how come bailing out the banking industry has got such a fucking...  Because then they turned around and just gave themselves massive fucking bonuses.  And that just pisses off people.  Yeah.  It all came out that they still got their incredible, over-the-top millions and millions  of dollars of bonuses.  But it was with the bailout money.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just pieces of shit.  That's what pissed off everybody.  That came to light.  I don't know what's going on with the money that the auto industry got.  Well, apparently GM's doing much better.  People are still working. 
[00:34:00]  And the bailout for the auto industry seems to have worked.  I can't bash him on that.  But he did promise to get the troops out of Iraq and bring them back.  A lot of them were transferred over to Afghanistan, which, you know, whatever.  But he made that promise and actually followed through with it.  That I can respect.  I can at least respect, even if I don't agree with any policy, I can respect that he said 
[00:34:30]  he was going to do something and then did it without this fucking weird agenda thing and  just something that's bad for the country.  You just hate that he's black.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  And you know what, though?  He's also, uh...  See, he admitted it.  Oh, my God.  I've got to get to a message board immediately.  It finally happened.  I've been telling you guys.  You listened closely.  I haven't listened in two years!  Then why are you talking about it? 
[00:35:00]  Just fucking go away!  Shut up!  Shut your face, fuckers!  You idiots.  I take pride in the fact that I haven't listened in two years!  Bye!  Just bang, shut up.  Oh, fuck wads.  It's kind of fun, though, isn't it?  That's great.  It's just the idiots.  I think the banks, though, by the way, I don't think the auto industry has the reputation  of fucking people like the banks do.  That's why people hated those bailouts more than the auto industry.  They're seen as more blue-collar guys.  Oh, my God.  The auto industry is all... 
[00:35:30]  It's America.  It's blue-collar.  It's different.  Fuck yeah.  I mean, no one's getting interest on their money in the banks.  Dude, it's fucking sickening.  What about the new commercial?  Five times for what bank?  With the guy...  With Ben Stiller's dad there.  That's all bullshit, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're going to get five times what the other banks are giving you?  Get the fuck out of here.  You know, I don't even have a savings account anymore, because I just didn't see the point  of it.  I don't know.  Right?  It's so stupid.  Because, like...  Unless you have a massively fat bank account, you're getting no money. 
[00:36:00]  Even then, you're not getting much.  Right.  I heard.  And then you get penalized if you need it for something, if you tap into it too much over  the course of a given year.  So I was just like, fuck this.  Just take it out.  It's criminal what the banks do to people.  You used to make a little money off your money.  You know what?  It would be exciting to see your statement.  Like, oh, look at the interest I got.  Oh, my...  I'd look at my passbook.  Back when, like, online bank...  Like, when I say online banks, like, I mean...  Not like Chase or whatever, but, like, there's no branches. 
[00:36:30]  They just live online.  And, like, the interest rate was ridiculous, because they didn't have any overhead or whatever.  And it was great.  And for maybe one year, I was like, wow, interest is cool.  Not like it was a lot of money, but you would at least notice it.  Yeah.  But that was the last time that happened.  We've got to show our age today.  We come from a time where it was 10%.  What?  10%.  And people used to talk about, all I need is to make a million dollars.  And then I can live off the interest.  And then I can live off the interest for the rest of my life.  Thus then... 
[00:37:00]  And they did.  Oh, dude.  What an idiot.  You sound stupid.  Do you know that you're not using that properly?  Thus then.  It's based on spas, you idiots.  So that would be $100,000 a year.  Yeah.  And then what do we get now?  It's less than a...  Less than a percent.  It's disgusting.  I don't even know what the rate is.  I've talked to Bank of America people, and I said,  Do you know you should be embarrassed by this?  Yeah.  You're despicable.  As long as you're not cursing at them and you're being gentlemanly  and tell them they should be embarrassed.  What favor are they doing us? 
[00:37:30]  They're terrible.  They're pigs.  What are they doing?  They're fucking pigs.  We've got Stunt Brain on the phone.  He's down at the DNC.  You want to talk to the Stunt Brain?  Yes, please.  He knows his politics.  Well.  And Stunt Brain, I always knew that you and Chris Matthews were pals.  I don't know if I would say that.  But once he realized I was with the blaze, his face turned into a pained expression.  Yeah.  You tend to lean a bit right compared to Chris Matthews. 
[00:38:00]  A little bit.  A little bit, I would say.  Yeah.  Almost 90 degree angle.  Yeah.  But you snapped a picture with Chris Matthews.  Yeah.  I got Chris Matthews yesterday and Joe Biden as well.  How'd you get Biden?  That's a good one.  Wait.  Jill?  Jill.  Oh, Jill.  Joe Biden would have been a home run, but I was...  Did you get a picture with a president?  Not yet.  Yeah, I got mine.  I got mine.  I got mine.  I got mine lined up.  Yeah, I know you do.  I got mine.  Well, you don't often bring it up. 
[00:38:30]  No, not really.  I'm kidding.  You bring it up.  I love rubbing it in Jimmy's face.  Okay, then it works.  Go ahead, Stunt Brain.  What do you got on this DNC thing?  It's all bullshit, right?  Well, both conventions are a giant mess.  It could be done in a day, but they take four days of partying and super...  Well, they want to lap each other's asses as long as possible, and you've got to think  the party's awesome when they're not on the convention floor.  There are VIP parties and big donor parties going on all over this town, just like they 
[00:39:00]  were in Tampa.  Huge parties in hotel suites.  Tampa, they were on giant yachts and in mansions.  I'm going to do a couple of those, but they're just amazing.  The amount of money that's being shoveled around this town is ridiculous.  Hey, what kind of party will a Clinton go to tonight, or Obama?  I mean, I'm sure the night of the speech...  What kind of parties do those guys go to?  There are bundlers, these people who put together massive pools of cash, and they will hold  exclusive parties while they will take over the best restaurant or the biggest hotel 
[00:39:30]  suite in town, and there'll be shrimp as big as your head.  Oh, wow.  Big as your fucking head.  Stump Brain, you know, who pays for all this?  Look around the room.  You guys are paying for it.  So am I.  Right.  Cool.  Oh, I mean, no.  So, I mean, it was big news when we hit $16 trillion the other day, and then these guys  just are willy-nilly just spending, like, ridiculous cash.  Well, each party gets a giant chunk of money to throw their convention. 
[00:40:00]  From who?  From the federal elections tool of money that we all donate to.  Why the fuck do it?  How about a third party?  How about taking that wasted money and allowing a third party to form?  Yeah, let that...  Yeah, let them pay for it themselves.  Right.  If they want to lap each other's asses.  I'm with you guys.  I'm with taking all the money out of politics, because we might be real candidates, and you  get the lobbyists out and the super PACs out.  Hey, you know what?  You just said something there. 
[00:40:30]  So you don't really...  You wish there were better candidates as well, right?  Yeah.  I think we miss out, because these are machine candidates.  These are guys that are picked by giant groups of money to interest.  Giants?  What is...  I'm sorry, Stump Brain.  What is a super PAC?  Those are people that can collect as much money as they want, and say that, you know,  like, we're comedians for Obama, and you can just put up any kind of crazy ad you want, 
[00:41:00]  as long as you say, I'm a super PAC.  And these are the things that put up all those stupid, offensive ads.  Oh, the super PACs pay for them, so the parties can be for them, but distance themselves from  them.  Yeah, Obama can say, I didn't make that ad.  You're around me, and I didn't make that ad.  That's from a special interest group.  Wow.  Who supports me.  But they do have the right to tell them, hey, cut it out.  But they obviously have some kind of relationship with these super PACs.  Yeah.  Behind closed doors. 
[00:41:30]  They're made up of friends, and again, people who bring in gigantic chunks of money collected  sometimes, what is it, $23,500 at a time, whatever the maximum limit is per person.  Are you inside for this whole thing?  Been inside.  I am headed right now to, you can't get too close, so they drop you off about six blocks  away, and then you have to go through two different security checks.  Right.  I'm about two blocks from the arena.  How close were you to Clinton last night when he was speaking? 
[00:42:00]  About 100 yards.  Wow.  That's got to cool.  A little press gallery, and I got real close to Romney, Christie, Ryan all last week.  It's just a little tougher wearing a blaze hat, getting close.  Well, how about you hide that?  You know me.  I like to cause trouble.  Yeah, but why wear a blaze hat?  You're not Jimmy Olsen.  Get out of there.  Get some man out of here.  It says press.  There are several different conservative media outlets here. 
[00:42:30]  You know, Fox News is here.  All the ABC radio talkers are here.  So, you know, we're not the only ones here.  But who's getting interviews with these guys?  Like, who's getting, obviously CNN, MSNBC, but who's getting interviews with guys like  with Biden and, you know, and Romney last week or whatever?  There are, like you said, all the networks get first preference.  And then occasionally you'll get second-tier radio guys, because there is a radio row set 
[00:43:00]  up with about 30 different radio stations.  Is Sirius there?  Sirius is here.  David Webbich here.  Andrew Wilkow is in Tampa.  Who?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know these people.  Why don't we know any of these people?  I don't know.  They're on the political channels.  Oh.  Sirius has actually a few people here.  There's about four tables set up for Sirius.  Right.  Last night, the fire marshal locked the doors at 8 o'clock, and there were a couple thousand  people standing outside trying to get in, chanting, right off, and, you know, all dressed 
[00:43:30]  up with their credentials.  Right.  And I went outside, because I was trying to wrangle the Secret Service thing to get Clinton,  and I got locked out, and I'm standing with Tom Brokaw.  Oh.  And he could not get in.  He was locked outside for an hour.  He barely made it in.  Brokaw was locked out.  That kind of makes me happy.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I asked him, can I get a comment on video, and I'm not anywhere near Anthony's voice,  but he said, no, no, no, no. 
[00:44:00]  These guys are doing their job trying to make us safe.  That's a smart answer.  Yeah, that is a smart answer.  Smart answer.  What other things are you seeing down there that we're not seeing watching the TV?  Well, in Tampa, the giant vaginas from Code Pink were hilarious.  They were good.  They're not here.  There have been two small protests.  A bunch of people on bicycles rode up to the NASCAR museum and laid down in the street.  Why?  They didn't do anything. 
[00:44:30]  They were just screaming.  There was a protest in front of Hunt Energy yesterday,  and the Occupy people had a one-block-long march.  One-block-long, huh?  Boy, there's another cause that was predominantly young white people that just, again,  they got bored with.  That's it.  Yeah, it's, uh, the conventions, they're pretty much typical once you get inside,  and I really hope for a lot more action outside.  Not going on. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  A lot more vendors here in Tampa.  They're selling a ton of Obama stuff.  Yeah.  Everything you want.  There's all the Obama things you could want.  Oh, oh, I got to get you some buttons for you boys up there.  They're, uh, hipsters for Obama.  Hipsters for Obama.  I would love that.  Yeah.  Every special interest group has an official Obama button.  Women for Obama.  Latinos for Obama.  Hipsters for Obama.  And then there's the button, once you vote black, you never go back.  Yeah, I've seen that one.  I saw that one on Twitter last night. 
[00:45:30]  It seems a little, uh, racial, let's say.  Yeah, we're going to do it.  You play the race card.  Oh, I know.  I'm sorry.  God, I always do that.  Oh, man.  You can't mention Chicago, pizza, golf.  Those are all races.  Or Monday.  Oh, that's right.  Monday, too.  Is there a pin down there that says, I like lesbos for Obama?  Uh, there's LBGT for Obama.  Nah.  And I saw sluts.  We don't need the rest of those.  Sluts for Obama.  Sluts for Obama.  Nice.  I saw that button.  All right.  Yeah.  You should see that, yeah. 
[00:46:00]  You should see the button I'm making up.  Anthony will wear it.  No one else.  Oh.  Can only imagine.  Yeah.  When do you come back, Mike?  Tomorrow morning at the crack of dawn.  Once, uh, once Obama's done, I'm on a plane getting the hell out of here.  I've had enough of this.  Hey, what's your take on, uh, changing the venue, um, from the 60,000 seat, uh, stadium  back into the 20,000 seat, uh, arena?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Because they don't think they could fill it. 
[00:46:30]  It had nothing to do with the weather.  I mean, the official, uh, statement is they're worried about thunderstorms.  Yeah.  So the people out there know, but a good point to a lot of people saying he just can't  fill the damn thing.  A good point to be made is the fact that, uh, with, I think 20% chance of rain, uh, and  thunder, and, um, if there was a ball game or something going on in there, they would  still continue it.  Right.  They wouldn't tell everybody, well, stay home.  It might rain.  You know?  They wouldn't.  But there are some logistical problems trying to get 73,000 ponchos handed out to people 
[00:47:00]  because you can't bring an umbrella inside the arena.  Uh-huh.  So that's, uh, every morning when you go in, if it's drizzly, there's a graveyard of umbrellas  laying out just short of the checkpoint.  Oh, wow.  I think this hurts Obama a little bit because last time we all remember the scene, 80,000  people and Oprah crying.  And now it's going to be, uh, downgraded from that.  You expect even bigger, right?  But that's why I'm thinking this has nothing to do with the weather and has more to do with  the, uh, uh, filling the seats because who, who wouldn't want Obama in front of 60,000 
[00:47:30]  screaming fucking people?  And in a weird way, it looks great.  And in a weird way, in the rain makes it a little more dramatic, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I've got, I've seen that before.  It kind of looks cool.  Yeah.  It could have been very dramatic, but moving it from a 73,000 seat place to a 20,000 seat  place that last night already had problems with the fire marshal, tonight could be a real,  real big mess.  Yeah.  I'm going to get in here early and I'm going to see what the hell happens.  Let me ask you a question.  Mike, I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
[00:48:00]  How come people with credentials couldn't get back in?  Like, how does that happen?  How do they let too many people in?  Look, God only knows.  This has to be probably the worst organized large event I've seen.  They really have, uh, too many volunteers, I think.  There are more volunteers than actually people who should be in seats.  And there are volunteers everywhere.  And the fire marshal just went, look, we're full.  Close the doors till we get people out of here.  Wow.  Is it true that there's about 5,000 delegates and 15,000 press? 
[00:48:30]  That's what I heard.  That's a good point.  The press center is five blocks from the arena and there are, um, press people from all over  the world.  There are bureaus set up with entire, like, giant convention rooms full of people with computers  and internet access.  Amazing.  So that's possible.  Yeah.  And there was a giant group of press here for the GOP in Tampa, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear the press outnumbers the delegates.  That's a good chance.  Yeah.  They are everywhere and they're from all over the world. 
[00:49:00]  I was drinking with a guy from Australia last night and they can't put it away.  Oh, they can't, yeah.  They're here.  There's a huge press presence.  The delegates are loud and have stupid hats.  But this is their, I guess, thank you.  Did you get to talk to some of the celebrity delegates like Newman?  I saw Newman and, um, he's about the only celebrity here.  No, Bunk is there for the wire.  And who?  Tony Galoob.  What's his name?  Galoob? 
[00:49:30]  What?  Galoob?  Shaloo.  Shaloo.  Who's he?  Cal Penn is here from House.  Yeah, he was on.  Who?  Harold and Kumar in Cal Penn is here.  Right.  He spoke yesterday.  I saw Will.i.am and Iva Legoria was hosting an event last night with Flo Rideout.  Do tell.  Star Stunted.  On a Hollywood gossip?  Oh, who?  Who's dating who?  Who's singing who?  Do dish, Stunty.  Do dish. 
[00:50:00]  Did you see any canoodling?  Oh.  No, I'm just a canoodling.  Yeah.  We threw out the canoodlers the first night that you guys from California got all drunk up and got thrown out.  I heard Godsmack was down there last night.  They just call them smack.  Oh, I see.  Yes, please.  Yes.  That was in the paper that they were performing at one of the parties.  And we love the Godsmack. 
[00:50:30]  I'll track it.  I'll see if I can find out.  All right.  You track it.  I'm tracking that.  I'm like TMZ.  You got me on the street.  This is great.  Stump Brain's in a bar with an Australian when there's real parties going on.  What's wrong with you?  Get into something.  I don't know.  It's in the afternoon.  It seems fun, though, drinking with Aussies.  Before the party.  You know, the Aussies are drinking early.  Yeah.  Stunty knows how to drink.  Stunty knows how to drink.  Yeah.  He's right.  I miss drinking with Stunty.  Stunty.  Anything else?  That's it, boys.  I'm going to head through security and see what's happening this morning. 
[00:51:00]  If anything cool happens today, I'll send you a text.  I like having a correspondent down there.  Yes.  Yeah, this is kind of weird that we have a correspondent for something.  It's our correspondent.  I like it.  You've got to call tomorrow for the big wrap-up.  Yeah.  All right?  I'll give you the wrap-up in the morning.  Thanks, fellas.  All right, man.  Have fun.  Cool, man.  We like Stunty a lot.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah.  I don't necessarily agree with him politically, but I like the guy.  How the hell did he get down there?  Huh?  The blaze is on the political things, man.  The blaze, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  That's Glenn Beck's thing.  We'll give creds to anybody. 
[00:51:30]  Glenn Beck has a few bucks.  Apparently so, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  You want to get Bill telling America to vote for Obama?  Well, Bill, yeah.  If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty  is declining, where the American dream is really alive and well again, and where the  United States maintains its leadership as a force for peace and justice and prosperity  in this highly competitive world, you have to vote for Barack Obama. 
[00:52:00]  Look, I love our country so much, and I know we're coming back.  For more than 200 years, through every crisis, we've always come back.  My blowjob.  People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticized for being 
[00:52:30]  a mediocre Shreyer with a bad set of wooden false teeth.  Shreyer.  And so far, every single person that's bet against America has lost money, because we  always come back.  We've come through every fire a little stronger and a little better.  And we do it.  Because in the end, we decide to champion the cause for which our founders pledge their  lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor. 
[00:53:00]  The cause of forming a more perfect union.  My fellow Americans, if that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote and  you must reelect President Barack Obama.  God bless you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  This is history.  Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. 
[00:53:30]  I do miss that guy.  He kept it fun.  We all look back with rose-colored glasses, don't we?  Well, he just kept it fun.  I drink through rose-colored glasses.  Oh, Chippa.  That's a good one.  Word play shit, Kelf.  Word play shit.  Well, this is what we're going to do.  We're going to take a break because right around the corner, we got some highlights from Mayor  Menino's speech.  Oh, he's amazing.  He really is amazing.  What a speaker.  He's not a fan of Romney. 
[00:54:00]  When he stumbled out.  Well, he's not a fan of Romney because he couldn't say his name.  Ron and me.  Ron and me.  Is that how he was saying it?  Yeah, he had a little trouble saying Romney a couple of times.  I thought he was all right.  I don't know, man.  But maybe we're just used to how he talks at this point.  Yeah, you pop some of that on after the break and people will say, no, he's not all right.  Okay, good.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounds really bad.  I think we're just used to how bad he sounds.  It's like how some people could have a conversation with Roland. 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  By the way, I speak Roland.  I do not speak Roland.  I speak Roland.  Okay, I sort of speak Roland when he's in here.  I could translate Roland.  During the after show when I'm driving home and listening?  Oh, I know.  Yesterday, I was cursing my radio.  I'm alone in my truck cursing because I was saying, I don't know what he's even saying.  But that's why it's so good to have him on the radio.  He mushes words together.  It's a run-on word.  You know how many program directors out there would pull their hair out if Roland was on 
[00:55:00]  their channel or radio station?  If he wanted to say something like, Romney is a conservative, he would go, Romney is  conservative.  Romney is conservative.  But I understand that.  I don't.  He's terrible.  What he's saying.  We should ask him what he thinks about this whole thing.  Oh, God.  Get his fucking take.  Yeah, that'd be good.  Is Roland listening right now on his way in?  If he's not here, I mean, I'm assuming if he was here, he'd be in here.  I want a solid minute from Roland. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, there are so many good restaurants to see.  I want one.  Good restaurants to see.  I want Roland on the clock for one minute to give us a whole overview of the DNC.  Oh, boy.  Before we go to break.  Do we know his party lines?  Maybe we could have a quick debate and he could debate his side and some other.  Anybody of equal intelligence.  Unless he's too...  Well, how does he say Mexican?  Mexican.  Mexican.  Oh, Mexican.  That's right.  Mexican.  Mexican.  Mexican.  So he's got to be more...  Mexican?  Mexican?  Democrat, obviously, right? 
[00:56:00]  I would think so.  What do you got before the break, Jimmy?  I had a dream last night.  I forgot that Ted Danson was the president.  Ted Danson was the president.  And I was at an event and I was actually allowed to sit next to him.  Oh.  And I was talking to him and something was happening.  We were about to get up and leave.  Jimmy's wacky dream.  No, but I was trying to bond with him.  And I was talking about something.  I was like, yeah, you know.  And he just wouldn't look at me.  He wouldn't look at me while I was trying to bond with him. 
[00:56:30]  It was him, Billy.  Oh, oh, no.  And then Zach Galifianakis stood us all up and marched us a different way.  That was my dream.  You have some wacky dreams.  We were important to do that together, so that's probably where I put that together.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That was my dream.  The Ted Danson was president.  Ted Danson?  I tried to bond with him and he just wouldn't look at me.  See, you have the same type of dreams as me.  Do you want to be friends with people?  Yes, I do.  I almost was friends with Obama in my dream and I blew it.  Fuck.  I had a situation in a dream just the other day where I woke up and thought, now, why 
[00:57:00]  didn't I realize I was dreaming in this dream?  Because I talk about how when things get too strange in your dream, you go like, oh, cool,  I'm dreaming.  And then you just go on Rape Fest.  Right.  But this one, I was hanging on to the outside of a jetliner and that's how I was traveling  from point A to point B.  How cool would that be?  I was hanging on the outside.  It was kind of frightening.  Of course.  And I was getting that weird falling, dream falling feeling.  I hate that.  It was pretty cool.  And I'm like, why didn't I just think, oh, I've got to be dreaming. 
[00:57:30]  They would never allow this.  Because you work at this company and that's how it feels coming to work every day.  You're hanging on a plane about the plummet.  By your fingernails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We see less people around here lately.  Yeah, that's true.  What's going on?  A lot of people are taking vacation time or something before they get fired.  Oh, before.  A lot of people are taking vacation before they get fired.  Don't let the door, you know.  Yeah.  Bada, bada, boo.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry? 
[00:58:00]  Hello, you must be going.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Thank you, thank you.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

That was Timothy and Amber  She would always jump up  I'd say, you got the look  And she'd go, I want to know better  And I'd say, you got the look  And she'd say something  And I'd put her face in the pillow  Yeah, we'd all dance Jordache  And slide them down 
[01:01:30]  Sure, I'd say, let me smell that word  Yeah, I could always tell when she'd been running around  Cause her little feet would smell  And sometimes Jordache in that little middle scene  Keeps the smell of the privacy  Yeah, the jeans would just keep that in there  Scrub-a-dub-dub  Somebody's becoming a woman  They're so young, their bodies are confused  The body don't know what it's doing  I bet she was jogging around the playground 
[01:02:00]  Did you fall off the jungle, Jim?  I smell a little copper  My dad says when we're in my room  We have to keep the door open  Jordache, basics  I'm not going to do anything different if the door's not open  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul  Uncle Paul  With the creepy old guy stare  Uncle Paul  Now he's coming over here  Slowly limping down the hall  It's too late now  Cause here comes Uncle Paul 
[01:02:30]  On an all-new Hoarders  A Long Island mansion on the brink of quarantine  And one Italian millionaire who can't let go  I have seven or fourteen disabilities  Anthony used to have a life  Until hoarding took over his existence  This is my stuff  I'm a collector  I'm not a hoarder  What do you want me to do?  You're saying me?  I?  I'm not a good parent?  Dr. Robin tries to bring Anthony back  And help him cope with the reality of the situation 
[01:03:00]  Anthony, your gun closet  Do you see what's on your gun closet?  There's roaches everywhere  This isn't good for you, Anthony  How do you even store food in this environment?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it  It doesn't work  These conditions, they're not livable  How could you have let it get this bad?  I've Epstein-Barr  That young girlfriend of yours moved out?  Danny doesn't even come over anymore  Oh, they didn't care  No  Oh my God, what's that? 
[01:03:30]  Doctor, we found a skeleton  Is that a...  And then my dog died in it  There's roaches in the movie theater  A karaoke stage filled with rats  Raccoons crawling over child pornography  It's like a carnival of garbage  All on the next  Orders  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Alright, we got one more thing  As far as the DNC goes 
[01:04:00]  Tonight's a big night, I guess  Obama's, uh, will  Oh, yeah  Will, uh, give his speech, I guess  Yep  He's gonna get up there and, uh, give a little speech  But we did have Mayor Menino  He talked  Thank God for Anthony tweeting that, uh, Menino's speech was on C-SPAN  So I went right there  Oh, you gotta go to the C-SPAN website  And see what the schedule is  For the, uh, Democratic National Convention  And you see when all the speakers go on  I'm surprised they keep it pretty tight, the schedule  And I saw Menino was up at 5.30 
[01:04:30]  Figured people did not want to miss it  Well, the big news networks aren't talking about Mayor Menino's speech  No  He didn't, um, he didn't knock the doors down, you don't think?  Wow  What did Sam say?  You cut up this audio  Hopefully I resign  Besides that  How dare you  What was, uh, your observation on Mayor Menino?  Well, I think, I think you guys were definitely right about people not, uh, being so desensitized to him as we are  Because we've heard the absolute worst  Yes  Like, not even English  The thing about this speech, I found, was 
[01:05:00]  There were a few flubs here and there and mumbles and stuff  But he completely lost the audience as the speech went on  Totally  And, like, you could hear  If you really listened, you hear the points he's making  And if another politician had said it  That would be the point where everybody goes  Woo!  Yeah!  Like an applause break or something, right?  Exactly  But nobody knew that that was their cue  Right  He's so bad at speaking  And getting the crowd behind him  Right, so you can hear him stop 
[01:05:30]  And you can hear what he's saying  And there's silence  And then he just moves on to the next thing  He's terrible  Awful  He really is bad  I don't  He's been doing it for so long  I don't understand how he could be that bad of public speaking  I don't understand  He really needs, like, a whole thing to happen  Like the King's speech  He needs that in his life  Maybe to help him out  Well, we had Jeffrey Rush in here  We should have said, hey, we got a job for you  Yep  Go up to Boston, help us out  Bafferston  Uh, so we got a few clips  Yeah 
[01:06:00]  Over there  Uh, Menino starts his speech choosing odd spots for pauses  And cites Martha Luther King Jr.  Martha Luther King Jr.  That's what I heard  Yes  Good evening, fellow Democrats  And you can hear those  He doesn't even have mic technique after all these years  No, it's terrible  And he doesn't know  He doesn't think about what he's saying  Like, you can hear in that pause  His brain wanted to say fellow Americans 
[01:06:30]  Yes, yes  But in his head he also wanted to say fellow Democrats  So he had to stop himself  Right  And then he had to make sure he wasn't saying Republican  Like, he just doesn't  He doesn't even know how close he's supposed to be to the mic  That's like us starting the show every morning  Like, good morning everybody  Yeah, good morning everybody  Right  Like, how do you not know how to use a mic?  He's a dunce  Oh, he is  He's just so intrusive  Yeah, he is  Good evening, fellow Democrats  And fellow Americans 
[01:07:00]  Aren't they one and the same?  Aren't they one and the same?  And fellow people  And fellow Americans  And fellow humans  Fellow people with ears and heads  All right  Just say everybody  Hi  Fellow earthlings  He talks for six and a half minutes  And he's filling time by adding Americans to Democrats  Fellow people in our solar system  Fellow people in our galaxy  Fellow people in our universe 
[01:07:30]  Right  Get it  Good evening, fellow Democrats  You know we've got to play it another five times  Of course  Oh, he's great  What is he, holding down a belch?  That doesn't sound like a  I'm mega  Little acid reflux  He sounds like a kid who just got shoved out onto the stage in front of the microphone  Talk  His abusive father  Talk  Good evening, fellow Democrats 
[01:08:00]  And fellow Americans  I come from Boston  We launched a revolution  We first sent John Kennedy to Congress  There were millions of students who have come to study  Including a great American name  Martha Luther King Jr.  Oh my God 
[01:08:30]  Martha Luther King Jr.  I'm trying to  Martha  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  What an embarrassment  Oh, oh  Martha Luther King Jr.  She was the one from the bus, right?  Yes  Yeah, okay  Yes  Is he referencing the Revolutionary War?  Because I'm not really sure  I don't know  Tea Party maybe?  Yes  Or is there another revolution that happened in Boston?  We started the revolution  You can hear the way the crowd went wild  They all knew what he was talking about too  Oh, yeah  What a weird bunch of things to say in a group 
[01:09:00]  Like he grouped a lot of weird things together  He did  Yes  Students, Martha Luther King and a revolution  Which one we're not really sure of  He's 30 seconds in and already there's murmuring  Martha  How are you losing the crowd before two sentences are finished?  You want to hear Martha again?  I want nothing more  There were millions of students who have come to study  Included a great American name 
[01:09:30]  Martha Luther King Jr.  Martha  Martha Luther King Jr.  Martha Luther King Jr.  Oh  Oh, is he a dope?  When I heard that yesterday  I fucking  First I start laughing my ass off  And then I'm just thinking  He didn't disappoint  Within 10 seconds of his speech  He didn't disappoint  Good evening, fellow Democrats  He could have delivered a speech like Kennedy after that 
[01:10:00]  And still it would have been worthy of a Menino  Just for Martha Luther King Jr.  But you can hear in between the pauses  He just loses them  He's non-charismatic completely  No, nothing  He's got nothing  One more time  Martha  There were millions of students who have come to study  Including a great American name  Martha Luther King Jr.  And he said a great America called  Including  Well, I've come to study 
[01:10:30]  Including a great American  Martha Luther King Jr.  Your brain is supposed to organize words  And then flow them out  But what happens  I think what his brain does  Is it opens a hatch  And dumps all these words into his mouth  And then he has to make a snap decision  Before they fly out  How are you a politician?  And you can't speak properly  I don't know, that's hilarious  How is that possible?  And he's been mayor forever  He's not new, you know what I mean? 
[01:11:00]  This is not like his big  Well, we pulled our stunt 14 years ago  Oh my god  And he was sounding like a blithering idiot back then  Oh god, yeah  And he was already the mayor for a couple years at least  I think he's almost 18 years up there now  Yeah  It kind of sounds like he's licking Doritos crumbs  Out of the corner of his mouth the whole time  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  You know, I thought  I thought this wasn't that bad when I was watching it live  But now I realize I just got used to this  You're just used to him  Yeah  And please put him in the context  Yep  Of what happened later in the night  Put him in the context of Bill Clinton's speech 
[01:11:30]  Sure  And then this speech  I think it's pretty close  Fantastic  I think he's a close second to Clinton's speech  Oh, was it?  Menino talks more about Boston  Boston  I know all Americans are proud to carry  The torch of progress  And in Boston  We take that  You know what?  People are playing along at home  And I want to make sure we don't miss anything  Dan Mooney says  He said  And-cluding  And-cluding  And-cluding  And-cluding 
[01:12:00]  Martha  Great America  Martha Luther King Jr  And-cluding  And-cluding  Great America  Martha Luther King  A wonderful MTV VJ  Martha Luther King Jr  And someone else wrote  You guys  Tony in Michigan  What are cunts of study?  Yes, yes, yes  Did he say cunts of study?  It did sound like cunts of study  What was that one?  They come to study  Oh, let's hear that again  Cunts of study  Yeah, I heard that too  Yeah, a lot of people are saying  I can't believe you're missing cunts of study  Yeah, that is a good one 
[01:12:30]  That means we've got to play the whole first clip  I know  Absolutely  Good evening, fellow Democrats  He's just like your loud drunk uncle  Oh, yeah, yeah  And fellow Americans  I come from Boston  We launched a revolution  We launched revolution  When we first sent John Kennedy to Congress 
[01:13:00]  And where millions of students have come to study  I've come to study  Including a great American name  Martha Luther King Jr  That whole fucking sentence  Is an abomination  Yeah  It's terrible  He fucking  Like, what is  We started a revolution  We sent Kennedy to Congress  Like, what is he getting at?  We started  Did he say we start a revolution?  Yeah, I think so 
[01:13:30]  Yeah  When we first sent John Kennedy to Congress  Right  He's saying a revolution in the country  In the way of thinking  Oh, right  But how are you bombing this fast?  Wow  No, I don't think those two thoughts go together  I think he really is talking about  Like, things that happen in Boston  So he's thinking revolution  Revolution  Kennedy  And Martha Luther King  Martha Luther King  And, oh yeah  A lot of kids go to college up here  Oh, my God  Holy fuck  Alright, let's move on to the second one  He talks more about  Because he forgets Albert DeSalvo  Also went to school up there 
[01:14:00]  Albert DeSalvo  Dissalination plant  I know all Americans are proud to carry  The torch of progress  And in Boston  We take that job very seriously  Mitt Romney  Oh, you see that?  That was where it was going to say  Very seriously  And he pauses  Because no one knew what he said there  Mitt Romney  And he moves on to his next topic  You've never heard it before in his speech  He just had died publicly 
[01:14:30]  He's horrible  Great America  They seem to like him up there  In Boston they do  But this is how he does on a national scale  Like, when you put him in front of people  Who aren't from Boston  He's just a fucking mumbling idiot  Yeah  Nobody wants to hear from him  Josh in Philadelphia  He needs commas  Yeah  Because we started a revolution  Meaning the Revolutionary War  I think  Martha Luther Harry Potter girl  Right  Very seriously  Mitt Romney  He may come from Boston 
[01:15:00]  But his campaign values  Aren't Boston values  Because in Boston  Because of Boston  Because of Boston  Is he doing  The dynamic of this speech  Is all over the place  I'm going to say it again  He just sounds like an adult tradable  Yeah, he really does  Mitt Romney  There's no way he's sitting in first clothes 
[01:15:30]  His inflections and everything are so strange  Very often  How come he's not sitting in first  Down syndrome  Anthony did that joke  I already did it  I wasn't in here  Oh, well  Should've been listening to the show  I was cutting up this audio  That we're listening to  Were you looking at  Bikini girls  On the computer  Bikini girls  No  Maybe you were doing that  I caught Iraq after the show yesterday  As I was leaving  It wasn't while the show was on  Uh-huh  But he was once again in his office  Downloading bikini girl pictures 
[01:16:00]  He loves bikini girl  Is that your fetish, Iraq?  Hubba hubba  I love how it always goes back to Iraq  Always  We're the furthest away from Iraq right now  And we know how to get it back to him  Yes  You like bikini girl pics?

I like Babes Daily  Has bikini pics  I like Girls Daily  Has the nudes  And I like Sex Daily  Has little sex clips  Yeah, yeah 
[01:16:30]  And I like redheads  It's not bad  Not bad  Nice fat ginger pussy  With freckles on it  Ginger girls  Are taking over  Fucking the, uh  Television  Airwaves  As far as commercials go  Really?  It's all henna heads now  All of them  It's amazing  They don't look too bad  Alright, we'll get back to you  Rock in a second  But this Mayor Menino shit  Is too good  Because in Boston  We know this country  Didn't become  Great by excluding folks 
[01:17:00]  They leave each other  On their own  What?  They leave each  What did he just say  On their own  On their own  They leave each  What did he say there?  They leave each other  On their own  Leave each other  On their own  Leave each  Shoemaker  Comment alone  They leave each other  On their own  On their own  In Boston  You know what we call  Immigrants?  Oh boy  Mom and dad  Mom and dad 
[01:17:30]  You know what we call immigrants?  Mom and dad  Mom and dad  That's just the Boston accent  Mom and dad  And you know what we call  The Jigaboos?  We call them Jigaboos  And we keep them out  Of our neighborhoods  We're the most segregated  Major city  Of course  Warm  When a pregnant woman  Was killed  And her husband said  A colored guy did it  The police shook down  Every negro in Blackiston  He did say 
[01:18:00]  Torture progress  Torture progress  People are picking up on shit  We're not hearing  Yeah  It's fun listening to a  You can't catch it all  In one fucking  Swipe  No way  Lonely bacon  My god  Is this fucko  Speaking Klingon  Yeah  It is  It is another language  Why would they put this  On prime time 
[01:18:30]  So we could all  Point and laugh  This guy should have  Been prime time  We all love to point and laugh  Yeah  You can't say that openly  But we love it  Yeah  The Democrats probably  Squashed that  Oh yeah yeah  They don't want to  Goof like this  They're like  Do you want to  They gave him a shitty  Time slot  But if you think about it  Okay  You got the mayor of Boston  Where Mitt Romney  Obviously  Was the governor  Yeah you think  He could give him  Some jabs  That would be a big  Fucking moment  For the DNC  Right  If the guy could speak  Yeah  Instead they bury him  In the middle of the day 
[01:19:00]  When people are driving home  Barbaston  I wish they would  Give him a show  They really should  I wish MSNBC  Would just put him on  At night  He's the greatest thing  Great by excluding people  Question mark  Oh  I don't know  Alright the next clip  Menino mumbles through  Some of the great things  In Boston  In Boston  Like many seas  Across this country  Like many seas  We see a progress  All around us today  Can I hear that 
[01:19:30]  For a second  Like many seas  Across the country  We have a lot of seas  Across the country  Atlantic Ocean  Pacific Ocean  Boston  Those aren't across the country  In Boston  Like many seas  Across this country  We're seeing progress  All around us today  In large parts  In large parts  In large parts  He's trying to be  A dynamic speaker  He's trying to like  Get the inflection

[01:56:00]  Could be a bit ornery at times  Yes  He was quite the card  When he was with the Mets  Remember when he wore the mustache  Ah it's legendary  Just assumed no one was going to notice  He got kicked out  For arguing with an ump  And then  A little while later  He's sitting in the dugout  With a fake mustache on  Thinking like  Everything's going to be fine  What an idiot  What an idiot  Did they suspend him for that?  Oh yeah  That's hilarious  Come on  He just went back into the dugout  With a mustache  How do you just not let him 
[01:56:30]  Fucking get away with that?  You gotta laugh  And send him back  Get out of here  You wacky guy  Ah by the way  Oh by the way  Because we do broadcast  To a lot of places now  Jamie in Puerto Rico  Listening to us live  Says the Puerto Rico version  Of mi nombre es  Called quien soy soy  Quien  Quien sorry  Quien soy soy  Starts this week  Quien soy soy  Soy soy  Shouldn't it be  Quien soy yo  Shut up  Shut up  Who are you  What's soy soy?

[02:05:00]  Stop it  Touch  No  No  Do you ever hear anything like this  This  This  This  Anus  Anus  Is a useful thing indeed  We all have an anus  All have an anus  Remember that anus  Is the proper word  Anus  Anus  Gives relief in time of need 
[02:05:30]  We all have an anus  All have an anus  All have an anus  All have an anus  No  Vulva  Vulva  Vulva  Vulva  Is what girls have done below  Vulva  Vulva  Vulva  Vulva  When she's naked it will show  Penis  Penis  Is what boys have done in front 
[02:06:00]  Venis  Penis  Penis  Penis  Most people call it vagina  Some children call it vagina  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch your private hearts. 
[02:06:30]  Nobody is a private hearts.  No! Stop! If you don't know, I'm gonna tell my dad.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private hearts. 
[02:07:00]  Sirius XM, this is the Open Entry Show.  Is the music gonna kick in, or is it a loop?  It's the whole song.  We couldn't tell though, because it's one of these.  Yeah! Nice! 
[02:07:30]  That's better.  That would suck if it was just that beginning part, right?  What is this?  Mmm, Audio Slave.  This is pretty good.  Beats the shit out of the fucking jazz I was listening to in the shitter.  Boy, if they keep playing that cock-sucking jazz in the bathroom, you can take a little break from the show.  You wanna go into the shitter, and perhaps take a piss or a shit, and be able to sing a little tune-along, or whistle or hum, or tap your foot to something. 
[02:08:00]  You know, everybody have fun tonight!  Fun tonight!  Everybody wang chung tonight!  Some 80s or something.  At least they turned off the Elvis channel.  I even don't mind the Elvis channel.  That jazz is the worst possible thing that could be on anywhere, anytime.  What the fuck is it? 
[02:08:30]  I don't think the Beatles were that special.  They, what?  No, because that's all we had, really.  And then the Beatles came along.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  Of course we were going to accept the Beatles.  Jazz?  We were done with the...  Horrible. 
[02:09:00]  Horrible.  Mark David Chapman stays in jail, huh?  Yeah, that was...  That decision was made...  While we were gone.  Yeah.  That piece of shit.  What a...  Did you hear the review?  It kind of annoys me that he could get laid in prison.  Yeah, he should not get conjugal.  That's the one thing that bothers me.  Why are they allowed that stuff?  He's a piece of garbage.  I thought you were supposed to suffer in jail.  If you're having sex, I don't think you're suffering.  I read an interview with him.  He's just a selfish cunt of a person.  Yep.  Selfish cunt of a person.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  And I wish somebody would...  Excuse me.  By the way, there's all that prisoner morality.  He's still alive in jail.  Right.  Well, I'm so sick of...  Like, I guess that they can't get to him.  I don't think...  But dude, you don't want to do this and go to jail.  Those guys do fine in jail.  Yes.  Of course.  If you're getting laid, how bad is it?  Right.  Right?  He was pretty honest in that interview, saying that he killed Lennon because he was the most  famous person he could think of.  Scumbag.  That's an attention whore to the max level.  But he admitted it.  Wow. 
[02:10:00]  He didn't even have anything against Lennon.  He should just be shot in the head.  I hope somebody fucking...  I still hope somebody stabs him for that jail.  Avenge me.  Please avenge me.  I gots to eat.  Sorry.  I want to hear Latifah's national anthem.  I guess she sang the national anthem at the game last night.  The Giants-Cowboys game.  Cowboys won if you're just waking up. 
[02:10:30]  But football fans know that, right?  Yeah, of course.  How did you do in your fantasy football?  Well...  I wonder how Florentine did.  Yeah, let's go.  Let's do the draft.  We'll have snacks.  Let's get some snacks.  But isn't it fair to say he obsesses over metal music like people obsess over their football?  Oh, did somebody say that?  No.  You're thinking that?  Yeah.  He does.  I thought of it after the fact.  I would love to say it to him.  That's a good one.  To see what he would say about that.  And if he said that, I know Florentine, he'd go, yeah, but I'm not doing fantasy bands. 
[02:11:00]  I'm not saying, hey, will it happen if Ozzy sang with Winger?  Oh, yeah.  Will it happen if Randy Rhoads played guitar with that deep purple?  I'm not doing that.  I'm just going to the shows and I'm going home.  That's what I'm doing.  That's a very good Florentine.  That's what I'm doing.  We all have our obsessions is what I'm getting at.  But someone did tweet me and say that Zach Wilde has a show on the Fantasy Football Channel here on CBSXM. 
[02:11:30]  Really?  Oh, man.  And you know Florentine has to love Zach Wilde, right?  Yeah, but look, Zach's just a metal guy.  He's trying to get on radio doing anything.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I love that.  I was trying to think of what the inflection was that Florentine has in his voice.  And it is that kind of dragged out little tailing off thing at the end.  We're not giving each other trophies after concerts.  Hey, it looks like Black Sabbath played the songs you picked.  That's good, man. 
[02:12:00]  I love Florentine.  He's hilarious.  He's one of the funniest people on earth.  Yep.  Yeah, so I guess Latifah was singing the National Anthem, and I'm hearing mixed reviews.  Was it terrible?  More people didn't like it than liked it.  All right.  And was it because, I mean, we got it right here, and we can listen to it, but I kind  of like knowing beforehand.  Is it because of her own inimitable style she put to it, or is it like a technical problem?  Is it, did you forget the words? 
[02:12:30]  All of the above.  All of the above.  All right.  No, I don't know.  I have no idea.  All right, let's hear Queen Latifah.  Oh, this sucks.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh.  It's an R&B version.  It's not traditional. 
[02:13:00]  She put a little saccharine music in it.  Sounds like a Christmas song.  Oh, very good.  That style.  There's a choir with her.  It's not bad.  It's Tom Brady.  It's fun.  It's not bad. 
[02:13:30]  What?  I don't think it's bad.  Well, the drum machine's all good.  You know what it is?  She looks a lot better than she used to, too.  Yeah?  Well, she does.  It's not saying a lot.  Yeah, it's true.  It's pretty milk-toasty.  But people get so hung up on the tradition of a dumb song.  Enough of that shitty song.  We get it.  I like the little mixing it up a bit. 
[02:14:00]  Another one.  Give it one more.  Yep.  One more.  It's all the big.  Jesus.  Is this a spinal tap ending? 
[02:14:30]  It was good.  That was fine.  I mean, it's different.  It's...  Her vocals are buried, though.  You usually don't have...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They're buried in the mix.  Is the bass taken away from my vocals?  I've got to turn down some of the bass.  She's got a good singing voice.  Heat will rock you, and heat will...  It sounds pretty good.  I like it with the music, but... 
[02:15:00]  Did you like that movie she was in, where she, like, tried to get that athlete back in  shape, and they fell in love?  Look, I accidentally watched that.  You did see that one?  We talked about this before.  I don't remember you actually seeing it.  We went through the trailer.  Yes, I was doing some work on...  I swear, this is...  Look, it's easy to say I sat down and watched it, but I didn't.  I would never...  It's one of those movies I said I would never watch.  It's the most not-believable concept ever done in Hollywood.  Fucking exactly!  Sorry.  I was doing work on the computer. 
[02:15:30]  I was doing some After Effects work, and it was on TV, and I just didn't even want to  change the channel.  I could give a shit.  So I kept looking up when, you know, you'd hear something happening.  Right.  And I kind of knew what was happening in the movie.  Right, sure.  I swear, I didn't give a...  Yeah, why would you...  There's no way to change the TV once it was on the computer.  No, I didn't care what was on.  That's just it.  I didn't care.  And she likes girls, right?  I think she's gay, yeah.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't you act like you like men if you're in a movie where you're supposed  to like a man?  Meow.  She didn't really even change her demeanor. 
[02:16:00]  Meow.  She should just do this every time.  It's like the mic's thing.  Ew.  Ew.  It tastes like fucking Pledge.  What are they spraying?  Well, good.  It's better than tasting like fucking rancid.  Yeah.  Yeah, come with something.  What happened?  She falls for this sports guy who's...  Well, she's what?  Like a physical therapist?  Well, yeah, but...  Star athlete goes down.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  She has a girlfriend.  A friend that's a girl, not a girlfriend.  And that one is going out with the sports star guy. 
[02:16:30]  And she's like only going out with him because he's the sports star guy.  Oh, I see.  And he gets injured and Latifah's like, I could help this motherfucker.  So she starts helping him out.  And she falls for him.  And he starts falling for her.  And then the other girl who's really hot comes back and he tells her to go take a fucking  hike.  Well, not immediately.  They get back together, but then he realizes, you know, it's over.  She realizes...  Everyone realizes that Latifah and him should be together again. 
[02:17:00]  Does he realize that the other girl was just into him because he was an athlete?  Yep.  And not what he's really about?  Which is what Latifah was into him for.  And Piggy Girl likes him because he's a good person, not because she's a fat girl who  likes an athlete.  Correctamundo.  That was always cool when Fonzie said that.  When Fonzie said it, it was great.  Correctamundo.  Correctamundo.  Yeah.  Do we need to watch the trailer again?  No.  No.  Stunk.  It's a bunch of bullshit-a-mundo.  I never fuck fat chicks-a-mundo. 
[02:17:30]  I don't fuck anything over 300 pounds unless they're twins-a-mundo.  Say, what's on TV?  Oh, it's Telemundo.  Mundo.  Hey, go to break Dumbo.  Hey.  I'm the Fonz.  Hey.  I was searching out a movie for me and my young son yesterday.  My young son in the car.  And I put on a movie called Hop.  Has anyone seen this piece of shit?  Yes, about Heather Mills. 
[02:18:00]  You saw it?  Oh, wait.  I think we did this break.  Or I'm having a major deja vu.  I think we did this and you did that exactly.  I don't remember Hop.  I saw this and it was on before skipping a jump.  Go to fucking take us out.  No one's following that, you piece of garbage.  Hop is a movie.  Yeah.  What's it about?  You got the Easter Bunny.  So think Santa Claus.  Okay.  And then he's got to pass it down to the next Easter Bunny. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, it's like the Santa Claus with Easter.  Yes.  It's Christmas with Easter.  But Santa's a person in a Santa suit.  How do you, what is it?  You got to find a bunny?  Well, it's kind of like royalty.  They find the next bunny to be the Easter Bunny.  But for some reason, the Easter Bunny wants to like do music in Hollywood.  So a human takes over the role.  Is it The Rock?  No, it's not The Rock.  Hey, Hop-o-Mundo!  Is it The Hulk?  No. 
[02:19:00]  And I made it through 15 minutes.  Wow.  This thing is horrendous.  Doesn't Russell Brand play the bunny?  I think so.  Why wouldn't you?  Good, good.  That's great.  Talk about that the next time he's in the building in our show.  Yeah, let's see the terribleness.  Easter Island, get it?  Oh, the big heads.  Go ahead, son.  Take a look.  Welcome to the Easter Factory.  I thought it was going to be real rabbits.  This is where we make all the candy and eggs that I deliver to the children of the world. 
[02:19:30]  This is so cool.  Someday, this will all be yours.  He's a rabbit.  He's playing drums.  He's a young rabbit.  He's crazy.  Are you rehearsing your speak?  He's not going to be a good Easter Bunny.  I want to drum in a band.  I want to see the world.  Now, listen to me.  You need to get it together.  Get rid of these drums and get your priorities straight.  I never saw this part.  Get out of the jungle.  My dad's right.  You know what they'll call you.  I do need to get my act together.  In Hollywood.  All great eyes. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Before they become famous, that lady wrote Harry Potter in a ditch.  Excuse me.  I'm Eby.  And you are?  In a horror movie?  Now we got it.  We got it.  Please, I'm going.  I'm special.  I'm in a chip, man.  What's that?  I'm really special.  Oh.  See?  Jelly beans?  No way.  Oh, yes, Fred.  I am the Easter Bunny.  Hop in. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, you're here, Fred.  My son ran away.  The son is very difficult to replace.  But not impossible.  Oh, son.  What the?  What's that on your head?  What?  Oh, my new ear moves?  Ah, hi.  The rabbit ears are a little chickadee.  They're like ninja fucking bunnies.  The hunt is on.  Eby said you guys were so scary, but you're really adorable.  Uh-oh.  The plot is hatched.  All right.  Hatched. 
[02:21:00]  What are you up to?  It's called a coup d'etat, which is a French for coup d'etat.  And the battle of Easter.  This is an extreme abortion.  We're here, bosses, now.  We're the bosses.  We're the bosses.  We're the bosses.  I'm back.  It's easy.  Ow!  Leave this to me.  Hey!  Wow.  Easy.  Oh, Carlos, can I touch the egg of destiny, please?  Ow!  There.  You touched it. 
[02:21:30]  That was harsh.  Hop.  It ends here.  The more sensitive chicks in the room may want to avert their eyes.  Terrible.  I apologize for even bringing it to the show.  Holy fuck-a-rony.  Russell Brand.  I apologize.  I don't even know what the movie's about.  Wow.  I guess the human becomes the Easter bunny.  I am literally going to smash my head into the wall.  I hate these fucking animations anyway.  That's funny.  It's so stupid.  It's half animated.  It's terrible.  He's acting with the real human.  That must have been...  It's Alvin and the Chipmunks with bunnies. 
[02:22:00]  What's that?  I would love to hear an interview with the real guy.  You know how it was?  Oh, really?  You want to get that?  Yeah, acting with, you know, fucking CGI things.  Well, it was a lot of fun.  I mean, we knew we had little rabbits.  Yeah, what would he say?  Terrible.  But it's a cartoon.  Hey!  Suckamundo.  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  I have to follow a dog act, I've got to tell you.  Oh, no.  It's pretty easy.  There is an interview? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  All those things in that town.  I was watching Chaser and I thought, that is easy.  Well, you play an animal in this movie, EB, the Easter Bunny.  You are bloody professional.  Yes, I do.  I don't know how you link those things together.  How did you know what the Easter Bunny sounds like?  I just use intuition, really, and my own voice.  Oh, okay.  A combination.  He actually is hard.  You have to play against nothing.  No.  I mean, nothing.  You don't have talent.  How dare you?  Hard? 
[02:23:00]  No.  He physically wasn't there, but his essence is better.  This is exactly what I was talking about.  I didn't want to say.  I was being very sarcastic.  Mr. Russell.  So, how is it?  Yes.  So, excited?  All right.  Well, I acted with a green screen.  Right.  By a green screen.  And other people were wearing motion capture devices.  And I acted with them.  And later, they miraculously put in the...  Did the movie do well?  I don't remember.  It probably came out around Easter. 
[02:23:30]  I never heard of it.  I think it might have actually done pretty well, but that's just another way.  My son will sit through movies now.  He was done after like 12.  I'm like, hey, where are you going?  He jumped off the bed like, fuck this shit.  That's what he said?  Yeah.  He said, wow.  Fuck this shit?  He said, fuck this shit.  Pretty cool.  It's a cool way to talk.  You like it?  Fuck yeah.  You not worried?  I don't give a fuck.  Fuck the Easter Bunny.  Whoa.  My mother would say, don't say that or he's going to leave coal in your basket.  Oh, it's not the Easter Bunny.  Your mom was an idiot.  Shut your mouth, fucking cocksucker, with your stupid you-know-one-handu. 
[02:24:00]  Your mom was stupid.  Yeah, your mom had a fucking affair with a you-know-what.  With what?  Say it.  I can't say it.  I'll get fired.  You should get fired.  Yeah, Hop made $108,000, $108 million.  Oh, okay.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's a hit.  What?  $100 million.  That made $100 million?  That's domestic.  It made $183 million worldwide.  I never heard of this movie.  Swear.  I don't remember it either.  I just went HBO Kids, and this thing popped up. 
[02:24:30]  I said, all right, I'll give it a shot.  Hey, remember earlier we had a tip from a listener about Tom Brokaw?  Uh-huh.  Tom Brokaw rushed to Charlotte Hospital.  Oh, boy.  It's on Drudge.  Oh, boy.  We have listeners everywhere, man.  Did it say their source was the opium anthony show?  I know.  I get scared.  I get scared when that shit happens.  What happened?  I was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, a bambulance. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, after an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe?  That probably did it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else did they say?  He was probably nauseous.  Brokaw's 75.  Yeah.  What was he taken in for?  Tom Brokaw felt lightheaded out of an abundance of caution.  He was taken to a hospital and is being evaluated.  I'm feeling lightheaded out of an abundance of caution. 
[02:25:30]  I figured I'd get some medical attention.  I'm guideheaded.  I hope he's okay.  He's an American institution.  Sure is.  He was on Hannity last night.  He was.  He's fine.  He's faking.  He's working hard.  He's probably a little exhausted.  I needed some time off, so I thought I'd take an ambulance and go to the hospital for  my lightheadedness.  Lightyheadedness.  Yeah.  I was watching some old news clips of Tom Brokaw. 
[02:26:00]  He was always good.  Yeah, he was good.  That guy's a good anchor.  Yeah, we don't got guys like that anymore.  It's Brian Williams.  That's a snooty jerk-off.  You don't like Brian Williams?  No.  I don't like him.  Really?  America loves Brian Williams.  He's a cunt.  I don't like the way he fucking sandbagged Bush with some shitty thing he did once, and  I met him at the fucking Springsteen concert.  He was a douche.  Yeah.  He was a douche.  That means he said no to a picture.  No, he didn't.  He said yes, but he was a douche.  Oh, all right.  It's like, go fuck yourself, you newsreader. 
[02:26:30]  You think you are?  You're not fucking...  You're not morally safer, cunt.  Morally safer.  Not acting like your fucking Ed Bradley over here.  What a great name.  It is.  Morally safer.  Exactly.  He used to hang out with Leslie Safer.  Or Morally more dangerous.  Oh.  Fuck, you think I'm going left?  I go right.  You certainly do, Chipster.  That's what I do.  We should go right off a cliff.  Yeah, we should go right off a cliff, too.  You suck. 
[02:27:00]  You don't think Ryan Williams is good when he's on, like, The Daily Show?  I'm sure he's great.  I wouldn't know.  Why would I watch that?  I don't know.  Do they watch me?  You don't watch it?  Fuck them.  You must have a very limited viewing.  Believe me.  I have a 200 capacity viewing.  He loves Matchbox 20, though.  Yeah.  I do like those guys.  Why wouldn't you?  Well, they like me.  Name one song.  That fucking big one.  My Sharona.  There you go.  No, I don't want to show off.  Bobby Valentine getting pissed off on WEEI in Boston. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Let's get it out of the table.  I mean, people back here are talking an awful lot about you.  I understand they make a huge deal.  They change the personnel of your team dramatically, a team that's far more challenged now to score  runs.  But you do get the impression that maybe you've kind of checked out.  Have you checked out of this?  What an embarrassing thing to say.  You know, if I was there, I'd put you right in the mouth.  Nice.  Good for Bobby.  Wow.  Now, he's saying in the paper, which you heard just a slight part of, he did laugh after 
[02:28:00]  that.  He went, aha.  Because now everyone's taking him a task.  But he should be able to say that.  I just punch him in the face.  Ha ha.  You should be able to say that on a radio show.  What did the guy, he was implying what, though?  Bobby was mailing it in.  Well, the Red Sox did one of those blockbuster trades for the future.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  So now, I mean, yeah, the team is pretty much checked out for this year.  You know, they're done, basically.  So they're saying, you know, you look like you checked out as well. 
[02:28:30]  I guess it's a fair question, but Bobby Valentine could say, I'll punch you in the fucking face.  Yeah.  Embarrassing thing to say.  You know, if I was there, I'd punch you right in the mouth.  Ha ha.  How'd that sound?  Sound like I checked out?  What an embarrassing thing.  Why would somebody even?  I mean, that's something that a comic-strict person would write.  You know, if someone's here watching me go out at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, working with the young players,  bringing in the right relief pitchers to, you know, get a win, putting on a hit and run when it's necessary, 
[02:29:00]  talking with the guys after the game in the food room.  How could someone in real life say that?  Well, let me try to expound on it.  I did say it.  How could you say that?  I did say it.  And let me expound on it.  Expound.  Because you were late at a ball game last week, you presented it, that's third, and then when people are asking you about it,  you don't seem to have an answer?  Let me explain that.  That pisses me off.  Because whoever wrote that knew what happened. 
[02:29:30]  They knew that my son was coming to see me for the first time this lousy season, and I got to see him on the road,  and that his flight was late, and that I was waiting at the airport in San Francisco for his flight to come in,  and I came in and sent the line up in and reported to my coaches that I was going to be a little late,  and for someone to say that I was late is an absolute disgrace to their integrity, if they have any.  Do you feel that you're showing up at the ballpark every day, putting your best effort into what you're doing, 
[02:30:00]  and do you believe your players are providing the best effort every day?  I just told you, when you said what you said, you should apologize to me for saying that I came late.  Bobby, I'm reading the information.  I can't apologize for something that people have already reported.  Were you not late?  No, I wasn't late.  When you call there and say that you're delayed in traffic coming from the San Francisco airport, 
[02:30:30]  and you're late at the stupid Oakland Coliseum, and you're not late, no.  Wow.  Yes, you were late.  He should say I was late, but I told him I was going to be late.  Just because you called doesn't mean that you're there on time.  Sounds like Eric.  That he's got an answer to this guy, though, is pretty...  What?  He knows how to argue his point.  He never gets off point.  He should go argue with a sandwich or something.  Why?  Because it's going, don't eat me. 
[02:31:00]  So what's this about?  That's a clip.  He's all pissed off.  He's very irritable.  I kind of like this.  Yeah, of course.  There's a little honesty going on.  Well, you know, we're trying out there.  We're doing our best.  He's like, fuck you, man.  Yeah.  What to tell you?  Bullshit sports reporters.  Make excuses to you why I'm not there on time.  He probably checked out a little bit, but how could you blame him?  Don't say that to him.  How could you blame him?  He'll punch you in the mouth.  Punch you.  The Red Sox organization decided, okay, this is what we need to do for the future. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Big blockbuster trade.  Of course that means the rest of the season is going to be a bust.  Yeah.  It was pretty much a bust before they did the trade.  Hurt much.  It goes on for a little bit longer here.  Do you regret returning to managing at all?  That's a good one.  I wonder if it's really a win.  I'd like to figure all those questions out, too.  But, no, I don't regret returning.  No, life is the journey, you guys.  You have to understand that. 
[02:32:00]  And everyone thinks that, you know, misery is something that people, you know, run away from.  I think you learn from misery.  You learn from challenges.  You learn from failures as well as you learn from success.  So, you know, this is what I chose to do, and I think it's been, you know, miserable, but I think it's also been part of my life's journey.  That was the headlining clip, because, you know, I guess it was news that he said the season was miserable. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  You know.  Well, yeah.  Well, it is, though.  It is.  I think so.  No, no, no.  I'm not being sarcastic.  I'll be honest.  I don't even know how bad the Red Sox are doing.  You're pretty bad.  I know they don't have a shot.  You know what it is?  It's like, why are you supposed to not be human and feel like, you know, fuck, man.  It's going bad.  Just say it's going bad.  It's a lousy fucking season.  Yeah.  I guess it's bad for morale.  Bad for selling tickets.  You know?  Well, the fucking, the manager gave up, so why the fuck do I even want to go to a game? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Your Yankees are falling apart.  Well, like I said, they won last night, so they're not tied for first with Baldymore.  Fucking Travis and his stupid Baltimore.  What happened to the goddamn Orioles?  They've disappeared.  Remember on Golden Fund?  He was a big Orioles fan.  He was an Orioles fan with his dumb hat.  Yeah.  Stupid hat.  Can we play Earl Weaver?  Earl Weaver.  Can we?  Goddamn fucking. 
[02:33:30]  Alice?  Alice.  Maybe she should go out and get a dick in her way.  Hey, hey, hey, yeah.  Alice.  It's the greatest.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Manager's Corner.  Manager's Corner.  You got it, E-Rock, or?  Yeah, one second.  It's loading.  It's loading.  Why don't you have it ready?  Really?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Now, the Manager's Corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's Six Best, your area Oldsmobile dealers, Anderson 
[02:34:00]  Olds, Schaefer and Strominger Olds, Lee Oldsmobile, Metro Olds, City Olds, and Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the Manager's Corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From Frederick Merrill, he wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some  more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying  to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you. 
[02:34:30]  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark, and you  can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds, he was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta  Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching 
[02:35:00]  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break  one open in a fucking night.  So if this cocksucker'd mind his own business, and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be  a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lady's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street, 
[02:35:30]  she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself, and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  Bucs Network.  Holy shit.  Dude, what?  Is there a story around that?  Like, what happened after that?  We've played it a million times.  I don't know.  It's the greatest clip ever.  Like, was he on his way out and he knew it?  That's fucking funny shit.  Maybe people just didn't give a fuck as much. 
[02:36:00]  He's still alive, by the way.  As they do now.  Danny's running in.  He knows maybe the backstory.  82 years old.  Is there more Earl Weaver audio that we've never played?  No, we have played Earl Weaver versus the umpire.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty funny, too.  Danny, what do you know on this clip?  Well, I don't know, man.  Do you want your bubbles burst?  It was never aired.  Is that a fake?  It was never aired.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they were fucking around.  And they just made it for, like, you know, for, like, the engineer just to, you know,  make him laugh or whatever, or the few people that were around.  But it never actually aired on the album. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  But was it, was he, they decided not to air it, or they knew the whole time?  No, they knew the whole time they were just fucking around.  Oh.  I know, it's sad.  Oh, why'd he do that to us?  Why are you saying that?  It's like, there's no Easter ball.  Dude, why would you, there's no Easter ball.  Couldn't you have had a better story?  Like, yeah, Earl was going crazy.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking basement.  Oh, so it's, it's like a, it was a bit.  Yeah.  They were doing a bit.  Probably meant what he said, though.  No, no, they weren't.  Jesus.  There's just jokes. 
[02:37:00]  Why wouldn't you give it the benefit of it?  Don't ever say that again.  It's just jokes.  No, it wasn't.  Don't ever say that again.  No, it wasn't.  He meant it.  Because we're going to forget, and a year from now, you come in with a great story.  That clip is ruined.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you believe he cursed on the air?  I can't, but what else is ruined?  Fucking, what are we going to ruin next?  Are there fucking clips?  Mike Schmidt, 100 Grand Bar.  Right.  I mean, one of the clips are going to be fucking ruined.  I'm 18 years ago.  I left Dayton, Ohio.  You know, he never left Dayton.  His knees were fine.  Oh, what?  He's actually laughing here. 
[02:37:30]  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player?  He didn't even have a dream.  It's true.  Somebody makes a funny face right now.  Yeah.  He's laughing.  I thank God the dream came true.  And he starts laughing.  It's like Elvis laughing.  He's not even a religious man.  He doesn't care.  He wasn't even retiring.  No.  He went on to play 10 more years.  Did Roddick cry yesterday?  No.  Rod-dick.  Roddick.  Get it?  Roddick, who's married to Brooklyn Decker, who we've had on the show.  Riddick.  Roddick. 
[02:38:00]  Riddick.  Who is it?  Roddick.  What?  Roddick, yeah.  Yeah, Roddick.  Roddick.  He fucking retired.  He's one of the greats.  He retired.  Did he cry?  Tennis.  You don't know him?  No.  No, I know the name.  I know the name.  He's one of you.  Since you said tennis, I know the name.  Did he cry?  Not that I know of.  I know the sports news as you check on that, Sam.  We lost Art Modell.  The guy from Modell's?  Why don't they look for him, for God's sakes?  Yeah, maybe he's hanging in a gallery somewhere. 
[02:38:30]  Art?  Yeah.  Maybe he's selling sporting goods at Modell's.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Art Modell.  How about Art Mo Mac?  Or Art Mo Windows 98 or something?  I got, like, clogged up saying that one instead of Dell.  Let's just play this.  Let's play this.  I ain't finished yet.  Oh, yes, you are.  More Art Mo Dirt jokes.  Art Mo Dell.  Of course, the Cleveland Browns owner.  He's dead.  Here is Roddick yesterday.  Since I was a kid, I've been coming to this tournament, and I felt lucky just to sit 
[02:39:00]  where all of you are sitting today to watch this game and to see the champions that have  come and gone, and I've loved every minute of it.  Oh, he's losing.  Oh, don't give him a break, you fuckers.  He was ready to go, go, go.  Yeah.  Pride, baby.  What it works, baby.  Is this in Flushing?  It's been a road, a lot of ups, a lot of downs, a lot of great moments. 
[02:39:30]  I've appreciated your support along the way.  I know I certainly haven't made it easy for you at times, but I really do appreciate it  and love you guys with all my heart.  Hopefully, I'll come back to this place someday and see all of you again. 
[02:40:00]  Last, I just want to say thank you to my family, my mom, my dad who are up here,  who gave me every chance.  Thank you.  And my support team who's been there with me forever. 
[02:40:30]  One thing I'm not scared of about retirement is the people that I go home to.  They're great, and I appreciate it.  And one final thought, I'd like to say thank you to someone who's not with us anymore, to  Ken Meyerson.  Thank you for everything.  I love you, and thank you guys.  He didn't thank his wife.  Ah, fucker.  Well, I said family.  We held it together. 
[02:41:00]  He didn't thank his wife.  Yeah.  Hey, thanks to Brooklyn Decker for fucking me.  Have you seen the body on that gal?  On that gal?  Thanks to Brooklyn Decker for putting that perfect hiney on my nose.  Win, lose, or draw.  Ass cheeks on my face.  Thanks, BD.  Did Triple H cry during his retirement speech?  He got a little broken up.  I hear tell Triple H is retiring.  Well, you know, he lost to Brock Lesnar, and he promised he would win. 
[02:41:30]  In the fake wrestling?  No.  He lost in the fake wrestling.  In the match, he lost.  Why is he taking time off?  Some kind of surgery?  Probably some facial work done.  Facial work?  What is it?  A knee surgery?  Brock Lesnar broke his arm for the second time in a row.  Doesn't look broken in this video.  He's got a cast on.  Fake cast?  Look how thin the cast is, because he doesn't want to ruin his really nice shirt he's wearing.  Oh, boy.  It's broken.  Let's hear him cry.  All right.  And I want to be the cerebral assassin. 
[02:42:00]  I want to be the king of kings.  I want to be the game.  I want to be Triple H.  I want to tell you I am going to rise up again, and I am going to kick Brock Lesnar's ass,  because that is what I do.  That's pretty good.  It's very believable.  Yeah.  It was. 
[02:42:30]  That doesn't sound like a very energetic chant.  Oh.  Thanks.  No, it fell apart.  Way in Boston.  That's what I want to do, but I can't.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Why can't I have HIV positive?  And the truth is, it's because I don't know if I can.  Oh. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  Oh.  I'm getting chills from this.  Douche chills, but they're chills nonetheless.  Brock Lesnar has forced me to look inside myself and say,  am I done?  Yeah.  Look at these dummies in the audience.  Oh, God.  It's entertainment.  Sports entertainment.  It's a show.  It's fake. 
[02:43:30]  First breaking plan.  Did Iraq have a hint this was happening when he was writing his fan fiction?  He took it in a different direction.  I can't say that I can come back and beat Brock Lesnar,  that I can come back and be better than before.  Do we have to do this?  No.  What happened?  Sam started this video where he thought it was going to get good.  Yeah.  This whole thing is almost 10 minutes long.  Yeah, I saved you guys a lot.  Wow.  Don't complain.  Where's the crying part? 
[02:44:00]  Well, he just gets like shaky voice.  When?  When?  We're five minutes into this.  Oh, yeah, now.  You're only two minutes into this.  There's only like 30 seconds left of the clip.  Yeah, quick.  Then what happened?  Isn't the show only an hour long?  Yeah, right?  This is 10 minutes ago.  Three hours long.  What are you, 1993?  Where's his shaky voice?  I don't know.  What happened?  Where's he gone?  He's just walking away.  They edited it.  Where's he gone? 
[02:44:30]  They didn't edit it.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  You had shaky voice, you faggot.  Yeah.  All right, well, let's start from the beginning then.  No, it looks like the movie Hop isn't so bad.  Does Iraq like Triple H?  Who doesn't like Triple H?  Not that he got a haircut.  He's the game.  The game.  Eric only likes long-haired wrestlers.  Do you like Triple H, Iraq?  I love Triple H.  Yeah.  Would you be interested in actually watching this whole video?  I saw it already.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  What kind of emotions were you going to go after you? 
[02:45:00]  He loves Triple H.  Ham, helmets, and ho-hos.  Wait, that's Quad H?  Yeah, he likes eating harps, hats, and hooks.  All right.  Can we move back to baseball?  Because everyone's saying you've got to play Lee Elia.  Have we played Lee Elia?  Who?  They're saying it's the greatest sports rant ever.  Really?  We probably played it, but what the fuck?  I'm sure it's been a while.  We'll say we didn't play it, but then someone will say we played it. 
[02:45:30]  There was a lot of tweets coming and saying you've got to play this from 1983.  I'll tell you one fucking thing.  I hope we get fucking hotter than shit just to stuff it up them 3,000 fucking people that  show up every fucking day.  Because if they're the real Chicago fucking fans, they can kiss my fucking ass right downtown  and print it.  They're really, really behind you around here.  My fucking ass. 
[02:46:00]  What the fuck am I supposed to do?  Go out there and let my fucking players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it?  For the fucking nickel-dime people to show up?  The motherfuckers don't even work.  That's why they're out at the fucking game.  I remember this one.  They only go out and get a fucking job and find out what it's like to go out there in a fucking living.  85% of the fucking world's working.  The other 15 come out here.  The fucking playground for the cocksuckers.  Rip them motherfuckers. 
[02:46:30]  Rip them fucking cocksuckers like the fucking players.  Got guys busting their fucking ass and them fucking people too.  And that's the cunt?  My fucking ass.  They talk about the great fucking support that the players get around here.  I haven't seen it this fucking year.  The name of the game is hit the ball, catch the ball, and get the fucking job done.  Right now, we have more losses than we have wins. 
[02:47:00]  The fucking changes that have happened in the cup organization are multifold.  All right.  They don't show because we're 5-14.  And unfortunately, that's the criteria of them dumb 15 motherfucking percent that come out to take baseball.  The other 85% are earning a living.  It's a fake clip.  It'll take more than a 5-13 or a 5-14 to destroy the makeup of this club.  I guarantee you that.  There's some fucking pros out there that want to fucking play this game. 
[02:47:30]  Some vacuuming in the background?  They're stuck in the fucking stigma of the fucking Dodgers and the Phillies and the Cardinals and all that cheap shit.  All these motherfucking editorials about say and fucking affiliitis and all that shit.  It's sickening.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  It's a disheartening fucking situation we're in right now.  5-14 doesn't negate all that work. 
[02:48:00]  We've got 143 fucking games left.  What I'm trying to say is don't rip them fucking guys out there.  Rip me.  If you want to rip somebody, rip my fucking ass.  But don't rip them fucking guys because they're giving everything they can give.  But once we hit that fucking groove, it'll flow.  And it will flow.  The talent's there.  I don't know how to make it any clearer to you.  I'm frustrated.  I'll guarantee I'm frustrated. 
[02:48:30]  It'd be different if I walked in this room every day at 830 and saw a bunch of guys who didn't give a shit.  They give a shit.  And it's a tough National League East.  It's a tough National League period.  That's all right.  Now, who was he talking to when he said that?  His mom.  Oh.  Now, I want to know, what was the Cubs' final record in 83?  Oh.  Very good question.  Because he said they would turn it around.  Because the talent.  They were 5-14.  143 games left.  I don't think it ended well.  There it is.  Turn it around. 
[02:49:00]  71-91.  Because that was his last year with them.  So there's no way they did well.  71-91.  It's not bad.  20 games under 500 is terrible.  They start out at 5-14.  So they won 5-14.  So after that tirade.  66.  They won 66 and.  74.  And 77.  77, right.  Still didn't even play 500 ball there.  Yeah.  And now people are saying Hal McCray.  Have we ever played the Hal McCray?  We probably did. 
[02:49:30]  I'm sure we've played all of these.  I never heard this before.  Yeah, we definitely played that.  I remember that, yeah.  Find Hal McCray, Sam.  This will be the last one we know.  Come on, Sam.  It's, uh, Hal McCray goes nuts.  I mean, stop.  I didn't want to get myself into a situation where, uh, all I had to go after him was all  right.  And our lefts were swinging the bats well.  So I wanted my left hand to hit us to hit.  Did you consider, uh, oh boy, Brett for Miller with the bases loaded in the 7th?  No, no, don't ask me all these stupid-ass f***ing questions.  What's wrong with that question? 
[02:50:00]  No.  Oh, he's in, in the f***ing house.  Oh, shit.  Stupid-ass questions every f***ing night.  Find the f***ing guy his breath for f***ing Miller.  Miller's starting to f***ing.  American tourster?  He's playing against left-handed f***ing bitches.  Brett is not playing against left-handed bitches.  Find the f***ing guy back for f***ing Miller.  You think I'm a f***ing fool?  Oh, shit.  He's tied all these-  Whoa, he's throwing shit. 
[02:50:30]  And stay out here and ask all his dumb-ass questions.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.  That's something.  Ask me that stupid-ass s***.  Is he bleeding?  Yeah.  Holy s***.  I'm not taking no s*** off.  You guys are not taking no s*** off the f***ing players.  I'm sick and tired.  I'm fed up with every f***ing thing.  No s*** from you guys.  No s*** from you f***ing players.  And they can do anything they want to do.  I'm sick and tired of all this bulls***. 
[02:51:00]  Now, put that in your f***ing pack and smoke it.  Oh, easy.  Wow.  Now, did he get fired for that?  Or what happened after that?  Come on.  You assaulted a guy.  You guys bleeding.  Back then you could do that, though.  Back then you could assault.  Back then it was 1992.  Damn it.  92, you were still getting away with s***.  You could get away with it.  Yeah, but 92 felt a lot like the 80s stuff.  Right, right.  You've got to remember that.  I bet you not much happened.  Maybe a little fine.  Yeah.  I remember when he played, I think, for the Royals.  Yeah, he was a Roy. 
[02:51:30]  You must be royalty.  Come on, go down, Sam.  You're in the wrong place.  Man, for the love of Christ.  What happened to him?  He threw a phone, which cut a report on impact.  He also served a...  Oh, okay.  What happened to him?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I'm telling you.  Hilarious.  You used to live in a time, man.  You not only get fired, you have to go to...  Oh, Jimmy.  You smacked my water.  I'm going to f***ing sue you.  I smack it like this.  You get sued.  Shut up, water!  Good one. 
[02:52:00]  You get fired, you get sued, and you have to apologize, and you're still a piece of s***.  And people tweet about you.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  Fired, sued, apologized, and you're still a piece of s***.  Good one.  Thanks.  Doesn't even rhyme.  Doesn't mean...  That's so stupid.  Iraq wants to play Earl Weaver arguing with the umpire to break.  Why, Iraq?  Just to wrap it up all night.  Why do you want to play that?  I asked if you wanted to.  Well, stop whispering it in people's ears.  You know, there's all the f***ing...  He likes to whisper. 
[02:52:30]  Stop whispering one mic at a time.  He whispers to us individually.  It's so weird sometimes.  Gets in the ear.  Um.  Oh.  Yeah.  Nice cock.  It's like your ass eating after the show.  I see you've been sitting.  Yeah.  We just said, you're watching the news in my ear.  That's a little creepo.  I don't know.  You can do whatever the f*** you want, I guess.  And we'll finish the show next.  Behind the rubber!  He's got to go behind... 
[02:53:00]  He didn't have to go behind the rubber!  For me, he did.  He didn't have to go behind the rubber!  He didn't have to go behind the rubber!  Oh, that ain't good for me, Matty.  That's the hell.  That's bulls!  Behind the rubber!  Oh, bullshit!  Bullshit yourself!  You're here, and this crew is here just to f*** us!  Ha!  Boom!  That's great!  And you shut me!  Ah, you're shit!  You've been late to get me out of here!  Oh, Earl!  You run yourself, Earl!  You run yourself!  Get your finger off!  You hit me?  Yeah, because you put your finger on me!  I'm glad you hit me.  That's right! 
[02:53:30]  You're here for one goddamn specific reason!  What's that, Earl?  To f*** us!  Ah, you're full of shit!  For years and goddamn years and years!  And don't you ever put your finger on me!  You hit me, Earl!  You put your finger on me!  That's okay!  You're goddamn right!  If you touch me!  I didn't!  You ain't gonna knock nobody on his ass!  You do it again, and I'll knock you right in your nose!  I didn't touch you!  You pushed your finger on me!  I did not!  No, you're lying!  You're lying!  No, you are!  You are a liar! 
[02:54:00]  You're a big liar!  You are a liar, Earl!  You are!  You are!  I'll tell you something!  You're here for one reason to f*** us good!  Wrong!  That's the only reason you're here!  You are wrong, Earl!  And you'll have your chance tomorrow!  You got it as quick as you can!  What is wrong with you?  You ain't no good!  No, you aren't either!  You ain't no good!  You ain't no f***ing good either!  You stink!  Your ass will never have our games in the middle!  I hope!  What do I care?  Yeah!  What do I care?  What are you doing here now?  Well, why don't you call the league office and ask me? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I will!  Oh, good!  Don't think I won't!  Good!  And the quicker you get on, it'll be better too!  Yeah!  Yeah!  That's right!  You ain't going nowhere!  You aren't either!  I don't know where I am!  You're up for five, ten f***ing years to know who's in the Hall of Fame!  Oh, you're gonna be in the Hall of Fame!  You know it!  Why?  You know it!  We're f***ing up World Series?  You know it!  You're gonna be in the Hall of Fame?  You know it!  I've won more than I've lost, kid!  I know you haven't, Earl!  Games!  Count games!  You don't even know what I'm going to say! 
[02:55:00]  You better get going, huh?  I better get going!  You better get going!  What the hell are you doing?  Tell me the truth that you had your hands on me!  Nah, that's wrong, Earl!  Wrong!  Wrong!  Are you looking for that perfect gift?  Well, look no further.  Introducing the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  It's unbelievable!  This four-disc DVD box set, personally narrated by the famous self-deprecating comedian,  will show you some of the most notorious places to pick up women in one of the most dangerous 
[02:55:30]  cities in New Jersey.  If I could, all I would do is rape jokes right now.  In this video, you'll learn how to properly approach a prostitute.  It's easy.  They do recognize you after a while.  They'll heckle you.  Like, they'll yell things.  They keep riding around!  Hookers never like Sabbath.  I learned that.  I would only pick them up if they got it on the right side.  I would stop.  Shit like that.  How to avoid awkward situations when dealing with a hooker.  Remember one Puerto Rican chick got in my car and she was eating peanut brittle?  She sucked my dick and it was in the hole with that peanut smell.  I was looking at hookers!  And I stopped and the tranny walked over and snatched my glasses off and said, 
[02:56:00]  For wasting my time!  They actually high-beamed and flashed the cop.  And I'm like, she took my glasses.  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  And most importantly, how to spot a fake.  A lot of times people get fooled, man.  I never realized that a fucking guy would get tits.  It didn't occur to me.  I was getting hookers for a long time at that point.  We were fucking and it was pitch black in my car in Jersey City.  I knew.  Well, when I discovered that the lady was not quite the lady I thought,  it's like, what am I going to do, talk to her manager?  I fucking dumped my load.  So don't be caught off guard and take this advice from someone who's been there time and time again. 
[02:56:30]  Uh, I should be fucking the mouth for the rock.  It's the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  Available at adult bookstores everywhere.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems.  I'm getting a stir.  One of the better covers.  Yeah, it kicks in real nice here, musically. 
[02:57:00]  What happened to these guys?  Where'd they go?  Where'd they go?  Never went away.  Yeah.  Still doing it.  Remember how intense that guy was?  Yeah.  I forget his name.  It's crazy.  Dave, or Draymond or Draymond?  It was a great interview, man, but very intense.  What?  Yeah.  He was second.  Uh.  He was crazy.  Uh, by the way, anybody keeping track, I am back into Apple.  Uh, I have, um, some, uh, Apple 700 calls, uh, for September 22nd. 
[02:57:30]  I'm waiting for their big, uh, news conference about the iPhone 5.  Oh, that's today, right?  Um, so if you want to play along with Anthony, that's what I'm doing.  I'm back in.  I got in yesterday.  Um, and I'm hoping for the best.  Thank you.  Yeah, I know.  I, I'm just waiting for, did you see the red numbers instead of the green numbers? 
[02:58:00]  Uh, meaning.  Yeah.  And Apple's on the rise, uh, you know, uh, it's trading somewhere in the 600s and they're  saying it's just going to keep going higher and higher.  Yeah, that's what I want.  I need, uh, I, I got my 700s that I have.  I was just reading an article to Anthony during the break.  After 35 years, Voyager nears edge of solar system.  V-ger.  I remember when that left.  Mr. Buttcabbage, our science teacher.  Mr. Who?  That was his name.  Stanley Buttcabbage.  He was our, we used to tease him and say, Mr.  We used to say Mr. Ass Lettuce instead of Buttcabbage. 
[02:58:30]  That's, that's pretty, you would chip back then too.  Why would you just say Buttcabbage?  Buttcabbage, which is, I think with his, with a V.  Buttcabbage.  But he was my science teacher and I remember.  1977.  Wow.  Mr. Buttcabbage talking about it leaving, this was in high school, so he was talking about  it leaving the solar system.  Yeah.  Or beyond the final planet.  It did something in like 84, whatever it did in the early 80s.  Yeah, my science teacher, Mr. Cockbroccoli, he told me that, Jim's a look of horror. 
[02:59:00]  Wait, let's do it.  Because, because I was very, as a matter of factly.  Well, what was his name, the teacher?  Mr. Cockbroccoli.  What?  Buttcabbage?  Cockbroccoli.  What's wrong with Cockbroccoli?  Yeah.  You don't have to read the R, because.  Buttcabbage?  I don't know.  That was really his name though, Buttcabbage.  With a V.  Fucked up.  Mr. Cockbroccoli. 
[02:59:30]  That was his name?  Cockbroccoli.  Cockbroccoli.  Cockbroccoli.  Oh, Jimmy doesn't like that at all.  No, I don't mind.  No, it's terrible.  I'm scrunching my face.  Yeah, Jimmy's scrunching his face.  Oh.  It was the delivery, because you said.  Yes.  Well, you know, Mr. Cockbroccoli.  And he said.  And he said.  And I have nothing.  Yeah.  But he said.  I pulled a Voss there.  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  We got the audio clip from their site.  Because it has 8-track tapes on it. 
[03:00:00]  8-track tapes.  That's their technology.  They're using 8-tracks.  But it's still sending back.  Is it playing?  Still sending back shit.  I wonder how long it takes a message to get back.  16 minutes.  Is that it?  16 hours.  16 hours.  16 hours.  It's 16 hours.  Oh.  16 hours behind.  16 minutes is twice the distance to the sun.  So, yeah.  Wow.  16 hours to get what's going on.  So they fucking blurt something out.  The Voyager 1 spacecraft is now more than 11 billion miles away.  It's 16 light minutes away.  Yeah.  That's what it is. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  That was in the article.  Oh, okay.  The Voyager 1 spacecraft is now more than 11 billion miles away from Earth.  Wow.  It blasted off 35 years ago today.  11 billion miles.  On a mission to Jupiter and Saturn.  And it carried a record filled with music and the sounds of our planet in case it encountered  intelligent life on its journey.  Play a record.  Disco.  Scientists have been eagerly waiting for Voyager 1 to become the first human-made object to  leave the solar system.  As NPR's Nell Greenfield Voice reports, there are new signs that it might be getting close  to that frontier. 
[03:01:00]  The people who work on Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, have been involved in this program  for a long time.  Norman Ness is a professor at the University of Delaware.  He recalls that he sent NASA a proposal for a Voyager instrument back in 1969.  And in December received a telegram from NASA that I had been selected for the Voyager mission.  He was ecstatic, because these probes were going to visit far-off giant planets. 
[03:01:30]  The prospect of leaving the solar system and exploring interstellar space was not really  on his mind.  Not only didn't we think the spacecraft might have problems living that long, we didn't  know if NASA was going to continue to support the mission after the primary mission had been  accomplished.  Well, NASA kept funding it.  You have to support it.  And even though Voyager's technology is traded by today's standards.  What if there's a big monster out there?  For example, each spacecraft has an on-board 8-track tape recorder.  It just keeps working. 
[03:02:00]  8-track.  We're getting anywhere from 5 to 8 hours of data.  Oh, you might have gone to these spacecraft, and it's quite remarkable.  Pause.  Of the two, Voyager 1.  5 to 8 hours of data.  What is the data?  Probably video.  What kind of shit?  Pictures, I bet.  Some pictures.  You think they're still getting pictures?  Yeah, they probably are.  They're probably snapping pictures back at the solar system.  Kind of looks back.  Holy fuck.  And then what about...  Can you wrap your head around that?  Some kind of radiation readings, maybe? 
[03:02:30]  Solar winds?  11 billion miles away.  That's a far fucking...  How far is that?  How many trips to LA?  11 billion.  11 billion?  11 billion miles.  Wow.  That's a lot.  Wow.  God damn, that's far.  One is the farthest away from Earth.  Don Gurnett of the University of Iowa has worked on the mission since the mid-1970s.  He says, Voyager 1's radio signals now take more than 16 hours to reach us.  And you know, astronomers like to think of distances in terms of light years. 
[03:03:00]  Do they?  Well, we're not anything like a light year, but we're now a substantial fraction of a light  day from the Earth.  And I just find that extremely impressive.  The question is...  Yeah, when you think about it, it's like, that's how far that is.  If you turned a powerful enough light on, on the ship, and pointed it back at Earth, you  wouldn't see the light for 16 hours.  The edge of the light would be gone for 16 hours, passing shit. 
[03:03:30]  So why do we see light right away then?  It just gets here quick.  Really quick.  That's a fast fucking...  From the bulb to your eyes.  So if you turn on, like, a little light bulb on the Voyager...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little light bulb.  Click.  It would take 16 hours for us to see it on Earth.  16 hours for the light to get here.  Here's why light stinks.  Because nothing travels at the speed of light.  We heard you all, Einstein. 
[03:04:00]  We know.  Yeah.  But they said even if you could travel at 99.99% at the speed of light, it wasn't like...  There's no way to travel, like, close to the speed of light or almost there and watch  it progress.  It always travels at the speed of light compared to the view.  It's weird.  I don't get it.  There's no relative speed to light.  It's always the speed of light.  Whether you're traveling almost the speed of light right next to it, it would still whiz  past you.  I don't believe that, by the way.  I don't either.  I think there's a...  I think it's our limited knowledge of physics. 
[03:04:30]  And I think, like, there's no way that...  I mean, in no disrespect to Einstein's genius, there's no way some mustachioed zilch on a  fucking blackboard figured out everything in physics way back when.  It didn't happen.  Yeah.  He got a great piece of it.  E equals MC squared.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Clever, clever, clever, clever.  We got you.  Good stuff.  But I guarantee you...  You think some of his other formulas were a bust?  Oh, yeah.  They sucked.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  L equals T-I with four.  No, that's stupid.  That one sucks.  They disproved it because they threw an apple and it fucking bounced off the head of a retarded  person.  I don't know how that disproved it.  Is he a one-hit wonder?  Yeah, he was.  He was formula wonder.  His other theories were terrible.  Yeah, just horrible.  He theorized that if you bowled a ball, one day it would leap a tree and people were  like, you're an asshole.  Yeah.  And then he had E equals MC cubed.  Like, and it sounded just like the first hit.  It was a little different.  But yeah, they said there's no way, like light... 
[03:05:30]  Which shows you, by the way, how fucking slow things really are.  Yes.  Like, that's 35 years to go 16 light minutes.  Like, a light year...  Oh, my God.  It stinks.  A light year...  Yeah.  A light year is...  16 hours, I'm sorry.  A light year is 6 trillion miles.  And the nearest star, the nearest one, is 4.2 light years.  Light years.  So...  We've gone 16 light hours away. 
[03:06:00]  In 35 years.  Now, how many years...  How long will it take...  God sucks.  He didn't give us...  He doesn't give us enough time.  Everything's too far away.  What the fuck?  We live out in the middle of the woods.  Why couldn't he give us a light year?  In our nearest neighbor, Andromeda Galaxy, 2 million light years.  And that's the closest one.  2 million.  2 million light years.  Why don't we...  Oh, man.  I can't take this size thing.  No, no.  I know.  Wait, I can't start getting to my cock.  Then we'll see.  Let's get back to this audio, because this is just...  You can't wrap your head around it.  Oh, man.  When will Voyager 1 finally leave our solar system? 
[03:06:30]  Voyager!  It's already way beyond the planets.  Way beyond the planets.  We even looked back and snapped photos of them.  Looking back.  Including a famous one of Earth, looking like a pale blue dot.  For years, scientists have been waiting for Voyager 1 to exit the bubble of charged particles  that stream out from our sun.  Then, it would truly be in the space between stars.  Ooh.  Just in the last couple months, researchers have been getting some tantalizing hints that 
[03:07:00]  Voyager 1 might be...  I know what the hint was.  It sent back a note that said, getting closer, dot, dot, dot.  That's tantalizing.  Tantalizing.  No, it actually said, guess what I'm leaving?  Ooh, we don't know.  Your inhibitions at home?  Yes, what?  Guess what I'm leaving?  We don't know.  Your wife?  Guess what I'm going?  Not tantalizing enough. 
[03:07:30]  3,960,823 trips from New York to L.A.  Wow.  That's a lot.  Sure is.  Yeah.  If that's even true.  That's a lot.  Thanks, Blue Heeler KY.  Hit it.  Ed Stone is the Voyager project scientist at Caltech.  Last night, in a public lecture at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab,  he showed off...  He talked about the curse of interracial relationships  to the chagrin of everybody there.  They said, we want to hear about the Voyager.  And he was saying, and they're defiling our women. 
[03:08:00]  He went off book a little bit when the teleprompter broke.  We allowed them to have jobs, and they're defiling our women.  I imagine 35 years later, the guy doesn't really have much to say.  He doesn't have much to say for the people that will show up.  Who the fuck's showing up for the 35-year update?  And what happened in the past year?  Oh my God.  He kept throwing his little old opinions in. 
[03:08:30]  He was like, the Voyager is about to leave  the influence of the Jew in our solar system.  Shit.  What is this guy saying to probably three people that still care?  You don't think this is a popular destination?  Oh, God, no.  Voyager 1 has been seeing decreases  in the number of low-energy particles  that come from inside our solar system.  We've got to stop that, man. 
[03:09:00]  It's been seeing increases in the high-energy particles  that come from outside our solar system.  Ah, the blacks.  So there is some kind of connection  between where Voyager is and the outside,  which lets the particles that are inside out  and lets the particles outside in.  This is uncharted territory.  No one really knows just what the boundary  with interstellar space is like.  So Stone can't say how long it will be  before Voyager passes through it.  I can't tell you whether it's days, months, or years. 
[03:09:30]  I really can't tell you.  Just stop already.  It's years.  From a science point of view,  there is so much that we're learning  that we had no way of really understanding  before Voyager.  Still, scientists are excited  that they could be getting close.  Voyager 1 can keep talking to Earth  for about another decade.  That's how long the plutonium that powers it should last.  After it falls silent,  it will still keep going,  but it will be tens of thousands of years  before it gets anywhere close to another star. 
[03:10:00]  Nell Greenfield, boys,  ends our news.  And imagine if it just zipped by the star  and the creatures that were there,  like the bungles,  the bundles,  on the planet,  the bundles,  on the planet.  We are the planet of  And it happens to go by  while they're all just looking at something else.  Yes.  Like they're about to look up in the sky 
[03:10:30]  and then someone from the planet of  shows their big tits  and they all go,  wow,  look at those big tits.  And the thing zips behind them silently.  Like, oh sugar.  They only gave it power for 45 years?  That's all they know.  Imagine that thing shuts down  and it goes flying by God.  Oh man.  Just short?  It's snapping a picture  and it's one frame away  from snapping a picture of God himself.  Just God himself.  And it's like,  power's down. 
[03:11:00]  Oh man.  Goes flying by God.  My flesh doesn't work.  45.  I guess that's all they could put in that damn thing, huh?  Back then, yeah.  Probably all the plutonium they could shove in it.  Why the fuck do our batteries not last long then?  Oh, I want some good shit.  We need more plutonium batteries.  Wowie kazowie.  I gotta tell ya.  So what did we learn there?  That's some pretty fucked up shit.  It's almost gonna leave our solar system,  but what does that mean in space terms?  How many more years?  That's what he said.  He didn't know. 
[03:11:30]  He said months, years.  Could be years.  I don't know.  But the particles are switching.  It's a particle pass over.  Oh, I gotcha.  Solar panels weren't an option.  What are you, crazy?  There's no solar.  It's fucking dark out there, you nut.  But is there a way to harness it?  That's a good point,  but there's gotta be a way to...  Isn't it weird?  Like, this is so long.  This is like crossing the country in a covered wagon.  Like, in time, we'll fucking...  I guarantee you,  we will have ships or things that can go out  and add power to this thing,  but you won't need to  because we'll just zip right by it. 
[03:12:00]  We will probably retrieve this thing someday  and just look at it and go,  eh, and kick it.  Oh, man.  And kick it.  The guy from Pawn Stars will just be like,  ah, well, it's old.  I don't know if there's a market for ancient satellites.  We gotta have it restored.  It's gonna take up a lot of room in my shop.  It's got a lot of miles on it.  What are you looking?  What are you looking for?  Well, I'm looking for $82 billion.  Yeah, that's not gonna happen.  How's 200? 
[03:12:30]  200 bucks.  200 bucks.  Um, make it 250?  I could take my wife out.  225 and $25 credit, store credit.  Alright, I'll take it.  You know, I wanted $862 billion,  but I got 225.  I'm gonna take my wife out to dinner.  It's the same fucking scenario.  Every single episode of Pawn Stars.  Alright, NPR, thank you for that wonderful audio.  Yeah.  Boy, they're boars.  Yes, they are, right?  They're talking about leaving our fucking solar system 
[03:13:00]  and people are falling asleep.  And they have that NPR voice.  Yeah, they gotta have it.  It's leaving.  For some reason, they have to have that delivery on everything.  The solar system.  They need Mayor Menino.  Oh, yeah.  It's out of control.  Today!  His voice is like that scooter lady.  Yeah.  Just totally out of control.  Today!  Today!  We leave the solar system.  Oh, Brokaw's back?  Making a big claim last night  about who's really to blame for the nation's enormous... 
[03:13:30]  They're saying he's fine.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's good to know.  He was lightheaded.  He had...  It was a weird lightheaded thing,  but they said it was because he was just standing up very quickly.  Like, what he would do is,  he touches his toes,  and then he stands up very quickly and says,  Dipsy Doodle.  That doesn't sound like a good thing to do.  No.  No, but I just like the idea of him saying Dipsy Doodle.  He was playing the teen game of the 70s Pass Out.  Yeah.  He was doing whippets out of the anus of another reporter.  In between segments for the convention, 
[03:14:00]  he was practicing some auto-erotic asphyxiation with his tie.  Jerk me off while I choke myself.  I do like the feeling that I'm passing out while I orgasm.  As the cum flies out of my penis,  could you choke off my windpipe so I can't breathe?  Thank you very much.  I do so enjoy when the tunnel vision starts,  and I feel my ejaculate pouring down my testicles. 
[03:14:30]  Fantastic.  Jimmy, you got any plugs?  Oh, a plug.  I do, actually.  Yeah.  Look at the time.  I have a time.  I have this, oh no, 13th, 14th, 15th of this month,  I'll be returning to Irvine to the improv.  Nice.  September 21, 22, I return to Columbus, Ohio.  Nice.  And I have a show going on sale Saturday, November 3rd. 
[03:15:00]  I'm doing the show with Artie Lang, Dave Attell, and Amy Schumer.  Wow.  Four of us will be at the Mystic Lake Casino Hotel in Minnesota.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday at 10 a.m.  So it's mysticlake.com.  I don't know why tickets go on sale Saturday instead of Friday.  That is such an old school way of thinking where people can buy.  Right, right.  Why the fuck do they continue to do that? 
[03:15:30]  Do it any time.  It's like we're plugging it on the radio.  We could say buy tickets now, and then we go buy tickets.  It's so stupid.  It really is dumb.  In this day and age.  Yeah, it's fucking terrible thinking.  What's Dave going to tell you?  I'll be a fucking secret.  You had me there.  I'm like, I don't know where he's going with this.  Fucking ring the bell, you cocksucker.  Take us out, you fucking bacon-making bag of shit.  I told you something. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, yeah, one other thing.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Sam.  3SXR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We've got some champions for you to meet right now.  Happy 18th birthday to young Sammy Roberts.  This is going out from Greg, Anthony, Bobo, David, and Tippi.  Happy 7th birthday to Ethan.  Good timing.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:16:30]  Did you have that on standby, or did you just think of it?  No, I had it on standby, but I wasn't bringing it up unless somebody else did.  Yeah.  But since nobody did, that was when we did a whole, there was a whole string.  We didn't do that.  No, no, no.  Fans did that.  We had, like, a couple fans who, they were writing in and sending pictures and stuff to all the, you know, local news channels that wish happy birthday in the morning.  And it's not like the local NBC, ABC, CBS.  Yes, it's the independent ones, like a Fox or a...  Right, and they're out in, like, Buffalo and stuff like that. 
[03:17:00]  There's a small town, you know, yokel stations that do these dumb happy birthdays.  And, yeah, they did everybody at one point, to the point where, like, every character on the show had a happy birthday.  You had some happy birthdays, right?  Yeah, and then, uh, there was, uh, I think some characters that Jim made up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Paul Hargis.  We got him on the wall.  Uh, Chip Chipperson.  You want to play a couple?  Well, first of all, how come nobody's answering the phones?  I got one guy on line one who's just calling, like, why wouldn't anybody talk to me? 
[03:17:30]  Where's the other guy?  He's out doing something.  What a dope.  Is he kind of dumb?  He's not here right now.  He doesn't, he's not very aware of the world around him.  He seems like he's...  He's not dumb, but he doesn't focus on that there's other things going on around him.  Um, I've seen Sal, this is the other intern, he'll be back, right?  Yeah, he'll be back in a few minutes.  Okay.  Because I want to talk to him.  And I want to see if you guys pick up on this once he's back here.  We have the two interns.  One who was just in here, I guess he's on the phones now.  Call us up if you got a what-did-you-learn or whatever.  Intern Fred Armisen. 
[03:18:00]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  But we got this one guy, I guess he looks like Fred Armisen, but he seems normal.  Like, he seems like a normal kid.  He seems like he's got his shit together.  This is all first impressions.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him on the air later today.  But, he seems like he's got his shit together.  The other one, who I think we talked to for a couple minutes on the air the other day,  who says...  DeMitri Martin.  His name was Gio.  They just call him Nat Gio.  Yeah.  His name is Gio.  He said his name was Gio, which is the worst abbreviation. 
[03:18:30]  Like, what's his name?  Giuliano.  I think that's his full name.  Well, we should call him Julie, then.  Yeah.  I mean, that seems pretty obvious to me.  It seems like, like, my name is Samuel, but people call me Sam.  If your name's Giuliano, like Salvatore, we don't call you Salvatore, do we?  No.  Because you don't like him.  Roland does.  Only my family calls me Salvatore.  What do you prefer?  Sal.  Right.  Absolutely.  Because that's the first part of the name.  So, Giuliano would be...  Jules.  Or, Julie.  Julie.  Well, originally he told me, just call him Julian.  And I said, okay. 
[03:19:00]  And he goes, no, what?  Just call me Gio.  Well, who calls him...  How do you not know what to have people call you?  I was reading about Stephen Colbert last night.  You know, he was like...  He was raised Stephen Colbert.  And he wanted to change his life.  And he was getting into TV and everything.  And he just met a guy, like an astronaut on a plane, who said, you should just start calling yourself Stephen Colbert.  And he just did.  And then he became Stephen Colbert.  And he became this massive success.  Maybe that's what he's doing.  Maybe he's been Julian for so long, he thinks Gio is this big monster of a success. 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  We'll talk to him later.  My favorite part...  Okay, yeah.  I'll talk to him in a little bit.  Not right now.  My favorite part of today's show has got to be Mayor Menino.  I mean, how can this guy...  Mumbles Menino, who was at the DNC last night.  He has been the mayor of Boston for like 15 years.  More than 15 years.  He's been the mayor of Boston forever.  And every time he steps up to a podium, every time he steps up to a microphone, it's like it's his first at bat. 
[03:20:00]  Like he's never seen it before.  Like, uh-oh, this speech means everything.  This is going to be my big break.  And he buckles every time.  How many speeches...  He has to have done over 100 speeches in his life.  And it's not like...  Hundreds!  It's not like somebody in your...  You were picked by your corporation.  Hey, we need you to speak at this event or whatever.  This is part of his job.  Yeah.  Where you're going to be public speaking all the time.  And it's like, even if you're not good at it, you do something enough times and you just get at least competent at it.  Especially after four terms? 
[03:20:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Four terms.  And what is a term?  Four years for mayor?  I don't know what it is up there.  It might be six.  Let me check.  It probably is.  He's been mayor forever.  And he doesn't know how to public speak?  He said healthcare was immortal.  He said immortal.  Jay in Tampa, you're on after opening Anthony Live.  Fine time.  How are you doing today?  How are you doing, Jay?  All right.  Great.  Hey, listen.  I learned today that Menino would never be allowed in first class.  That's right.  You double learned it. 
[03:21:00]  Because I guess I apparently accidentally stole Anthony's joke when I wasn't listening because I was cutting up the audio.  Thank you, Jay.  But you definitely learned that.  That point was enforced to the upteenth degree on the Opie and Anthony show today.  But yeah, it's like this is the first time that he's done a speech.  It's like Mayor Menino comes across as one of those like, you know how every few years you hear about some local town who's got an 18-year-old mayor who's some kid out of high school who just decided to run for mayor and he got it.  And he's doing nervous speeches and stuff because he's a kid. 
[03:21:30]  He doesn't know what he's doing.  This is Mayor Menino, except he's an old man who's been in office for years.  1993.  He started in 1993.  I don't even remember.  I was in third grade.  And look at what's happened since then.  Let's see.  Drew in Minnesota.  Drew, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hello.  Love the show, guys.  Thanks, Drew.  So today I learned that Jim is going to be in Minnesota here doing a comedy show with Amy Schumer, David Tell. 
[03:22:00]  That's right.  Now, what I found out or what I think is interesting is that that casino is a dry casino.  There's no liquor whatsoever.  And I'm wondering how that's going to play.  Well, I mean, it'll probably be better, I would think, for him.  It's probably easier to do this show without drunk people.  People will still go, don't you think?  Well, I'm sure they will, yeah.  I've heard Jimmy say that one thing he dislikes the most is his drunk asses.  Yeah, I mean, they're difficult because, you know, people get drunk and they think they're all comedians. 
[03:22:30]  Like, they're like, oh, this guy's on stage telling jokes.  I could tell some jokes myself.  Yeah.  From my perspective, to the audience, I appreciate all the ability to kind of lubricate the emotions, help him relax.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Comedy is pretty easy to enjoy sober, though.  I could see some other stuff.  I mean, you could sit there and laugh at somebody if you're sober.  I think it'll be all right.  I think it'll be okay.  All right.  Thank you, Drew.  Good question.  What's this?  Scrambler?  Tammy, happy birthday. 
[03:23:00]  Thanks, Scrambler.  My wife's aunt, she is a public speaking coach.  And she teaches people like heads of companies, public speakers, people running for politician seats, how to not fumble with their hands and walk around and all that bullshit.  So they don't look like idiots.  And I understand that, like, public speaking doesn't come naturally to most people and that it's, you know, the most, I guess it's the most common phobia of all.  Like, that's the thing that people fear more than anything is public speaking. 
[03:23:30]  But this is not the guy's first time at a podium.  He's been a mayor for 20 years.  You'd think just by process of doing it a thousand times he'd be good.  Or decent.  At least he'd be able to form a sentence.  He wouldn't strike out within the first 30 seconds of his speech.  Exactly.  And he's the mayor.  So he should have somebody that he pays just to make sure he doesn't look like an asshole while he's reading a speech. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, but he's got to be so full of himself at this point that he thinks he's great.  Like, he just doesn't want help from anybody.  Yeah, who else would be mayor for 20 consecutive years?  He's got to think that he's just the shit and he's putting all this behind him.  All the criticisms, they're all wrong.  I'm a great public speaker.  I just won't re-watch any of my speeches.  And maybe he's like, well, they keep re-electing me, so maybe they like how much I sound like an asshole when I'm up here.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Scrambler.  And I mean, listen, I hope Mayor Menino is mayor forever. 
[03:24:30]  Why are they closing the curtains, E-Rock?  Um, I don't know.  There's always hijinks going on here.  Assuming it's something that's a surprise for me.  That would be news to me, too.  I've been in here.  I know you've been in there, but, you know.  Uh, Joker?  Hey, uh, Sam, real quick, just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.  And are you changing your name to Sam Robert?  Yeah, maybe that's what I need.  Something a little more powerful.  That'll be your wrestling name.  Sam Robert.  I'm French-Canadian. 
[03:25:00]  French-Canadians are always villains, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  Ken.  Yeah, I learned, uh, today, 12 minutes into the movie, Hop.  Uh-huh.  I hope these kids have fucked this shit.  Woo!  This is okay.  Thank you, Ken.  I don't know what the, woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Okay, there's a balloon.  Oh, birthday king.  I guess I'm the birthday king today.  That's right.  Roland.  Ice cream cake!  Roland just came in with an ice cream cake.  Sal is taking a picture.  I guess this will be on Facebook and Twitter and stuff.  It's delicious.  Troy, are you just here for the party? 
[03:25:30]  You heard there was a party?  Yeah, I'm here to hang out.  Yeah.  I heard there was some, uh, ice cream cake?  That looks good.  Roland, any excuse for ice cream cake?  Yes!  You gonna be able to expense this?  Well, that's why I took a little bit to get approved.  Yay!  Yay!  Eric, did you know this was coming?  Uh, I had an idea.  I wasn't 100% sure.  So how about, why wouldn't you tell Eric and he'd get a little music?  This is a very lackluster thing.  Well, it's better than nothing.  That's true.  You're right.  I mean, I'm just saying a little music.  A lot of birthdays fly by here and nobody gives a shit.  Is that what happened to you? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah!  I texted you from Hawaii.  That was nice to you.  Thank you.  But technically, the music would just be in the loop, so it doesn't matter.  That's what I learned today.  Oh, good.  Thank you so much.  I got a crown-shaped Mylar balloon.  I got ice cream cake.  It says, happy birthday, Sam.  Oh, those are M&M's.  Yeah.  There's M&M's on the cake?  Yeah.  That's incredible.  You see this, Julie?  This is the type of thing that you can attack.  Wait, you said your name was...  Gio.  But what's it short for?  Juliano.  All right, so Julie. 
[03:26:30]  You can call me Julie if you want.  Yeah, Julie.  That seems like a little...  Julie's a little...  Do I kick him, Jules?  Intern Julie.  I've heard Jules to Julie, honestly, but...  Why?  Well, I mean...  Wait, Juliano.  What about Julia?  Nah.  Jules.  We'll go...  Julie.  Julie is probably...  I mean, just something...  Because you need radio, you need something quick.  You need something that slides off the tongue.  Jules.  You think of Julie?  Julie.  Is Julie invited to the ice cream party, Roland?  Yeah, I had to carry the plates and forks and shit.  But Roland, you can't invite yourself.  Does he always look confused?  Do you? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, I was...  Right, he's always confused.  Like, if you say, hey, what's up, dude?  And he gives you that look like...  Is it the balloon?  I'm holding a giant balloon as we broadcast.  No, he does it all the time.  Oh, it's not just...  Well, the balloon scene is a bit pompous, like you're the king.  Well, you gave it to me.  I know.  It's a giant crown that says birthday king on it.  As Hallmark, what's the most obnoxious birthday balloon you have?  Is that what you did?  Yeah.  Well, thank you very much, Roland.  I very much appreciate...  Yes, cut the cake, Troy.  It's probably hard.  Cut the cake.  Julie, you can have a piece of cake.  I think that's fair.  It's really hard, yeah, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Well, it should be.  I hope so.  It's ice cream cake.  We're going to need a few minutes to defrost.  Okay, so let it defrost in here for a couple minutes, then.  Julie, you can enjoy the cake with us.  That's no problem.  Do you get confused a lot?  Is that a thing?  Well, I mean, Sal just makes me feel stupid because he's good at Pro Tools and shit, but...  Is that what happens, Sal?  You go, hey, you know Pro Tools?  And he's like, no.  You're a fucking idiot.  I don't know what that means.  You'll make yourself feel better.  It's not just Sal.  He does it to everybody.  Okay, so is it just Sal that makes you feel stupid or everybody? 
[03:28:00]  Well, I mean, I don't actually feel stupid.  I feel like Sal tries to make me feel stupid.  Sal, do you actively...  Sal be your...  I mean, because Sal, you know, you have to see from Sal's perspective, he gets made fun  of on the air a lot.  It's been established that he was a better intern than he is an employee.  Sure, shit rolls downhill.  Right, he's got to take it out on somebody, so he's like...  Also, he has puppet hair.  He's got puppet hair, and according to Roland, the tattoo is not a good choice, you don't  think?  No.  No?  Okay, so Roland's not a good choice.  He should get a fake one and say, hey guys, what do you think?  And people go, oh, awesome. 
[03:28:30]  Then he goes back up and make it real.  I understand.  Man, so do you think that goes on, Julie, that Sal sits here trying to make you feel  stupid so he feels better about himself?  Yeah, exactly.  Let me hold the balloon while I'm talking, just so everybody knows who the birthday king  is.  I have no idea what that means.  I've been the one who's been saving your ass on numerous occasions here so far.  You don't have to talk that slowly to him.  He's not an idiot.  Sal's so angry.  The guy's just been here three days.  But why is he saying that, because I know Pro Tools, one has nothing to do with the  other.  No, well, what are you saving me from, really?  It's my first week, and I'm not... 
[03:29:00]  I could have...  You could have gotten in trouble many of times if I didn't stop you from doing numerous  things.  What could he have gotten in trouble for?  Not for saying what?  That he was the birthday king?  Does he not realize only one person gets to be the birthday king?  You could even ask Eric.  Come on.  Eric, did he do things that could have gotten him in trouble that Sal saved him from?  Well, you know how it was determined Sal will be on the phones for a little while, right?  So if Sal has to actually legitimately run and grab something or do something, right,  during a break, say, Gia will hop on the phone? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, we do.  It's Julie.  Oh, Julie will hop on the phone.  Or Jenny.  Jenny or Julie?  Which is better?  Jenny or Julie?  I like Julie.  What about Julia?  Yeah.  We like Julie.  It rolls off the tongue?  Julie.  Okay, Julie.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  So all of a sudden, Julie will hop in, and he's sitting there ready to answer the phones,  and then I'm not paying attention because I'm running the computers here, and I'll look  over.  I go, get up.  What are you doing?  Don't answer the phones.  Uh-huh.  So I said, if you're answering something and it comes up on the screen and Oak goes,  you know how he likes to bring it to Sam's attention that there's something wrong on 
[03:30:00]  the phones?  Sure.  Then all of a sudden, it's going to be my fault because I didn't see him hop on there.  And to be fair, that would be your fault.  Yeah.  Because you are the intern boss.  Sure.  Are you?  Yes, I am.  You are.  Now, you quit, but as we discussed yesterday on the show, you were informed you're not  allowed to quit?  Is that the deal?  Sort of, yes.  You're kind of like, well, and then you're like, well, I want more money.  And they're like, no, no, no, no, no.  We're not going to give you more money, but you're not allowed to quit.  We'll talk in February.  Okay, yeah.  And you know what that means.  Yeah.  It's unfortunate, but it's just...  You went through that. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I know what it means.  I know, Eric.  I know very well.  So, Julie, do you think that maybe you're being a little harsh on Sal?  That maybe he doesn't mean to make you feel stupid?  He's trying to save you?  I don't think Sal's attacked him or anything.  Anything's possible.  I mean, he had to be my boss in Eric's place the first week, so...  No, no, no, no.  That's not the case.  I was never your boss once.  I've just been showing you...  I thought Troy was supposed to be the intern boss when Eric wasn't around.  Sal is the assistant boss.  No, I was absolutely showing both the interns the ropes, the routine of things, how we do 
[03:31:00]  things around here, because there's a particular way.  Of course.  And there's ways to, if you do them the right way, you avoid a problem.  Right.  And I've reiterated many times to both interns saying, I'm not trying to sound like a dick.  If I'm telling you this, I'm just trying to save your...  Use your dick words.  I'm trying to save you in the event something goes wrong.  Did Julie, Troy, did Julie think I was just talking to myself?  I noticed he didn't try to put headphones on, so he didn't hear Eric.  No, yeah.  Eric's head...  I haven't put on headphones, because he's just kind of staring blankly.  Because, yeah, I mean, they're long...  Eric broadcasts from a different room, and so you need headphones to hear him. 
[03:31:30]  Wait, it's not a full piece, it's just a half piece.  How come you want Troy to wait?  I mean, I guess I'm the birthday king, so it's my final say.  Yeah, but isn't Sansa also got the first piece?  Yeah, but it's not really a piece, it's just a chunk.  Just, you know what?  The king does need a royal taste tester.  So go ahead, Troy.  Taste, you know, so I don't want to be poisoned.  You know, when you're the king, everybody's trying to take you down.  And there only gets to be one birthday king.  Isn't that right, Lady Trucker?  Absolutely. 
[03:32:00]  Happy birthday.  To you.  Happy birthday.  Oh, yeah.  To you.  This is sexy.  Happy birthday, dear Sammy.  Ooh, Sammy.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you so much, Lady Trucker.  Yeah, last year I got Zack Ryder, and this year I got Lady Trucker.  What a year it's been.  We're only moving upwards. 
[03:32:30]  Upwards, upwards, upwards, and...  Downhill.  Downhill.  Very far downhill.  That's actually...  I just want to say this.  Only the set...  What type of ice cream is it?  It's vanilla chocolate with a little crunchies.  You like the crunchies, don't you?  I love the crunchies, Troy.  You know that about me.  Can we move that cake just a little bit more into the...  So it's not on top of buttons?  Yeah, into a certain area where somebody doesn't like things sticky.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  Make sure of that, Julie.  That's only...  That's actually the second most disturbing birthday message I got. 
[03:33:00]  You all know Dr. Steve.  He does the weird medicine show on the weekends.  He's a legitimate doctor.  Like, he's...  That's how he became Dr. Steve.  He went to medical school, and he became a doctor.  And then he started using his first name instead of his last name, so he wasn't so identifiable.  But he helps people.  Like, people go see him, and he helps him.  And this is a professional doctor.  And he gave me a nice birthday gift.  And so I was going to call him, and then I fell asleep.  And then when I woke up to call him, I noticed I had a voicemail from Dr. Steve. 
[03:33:30]  And the first thing I thought was, oh, man.  Like, now it seems like I'm just calling him because he called me, and he left me this voicemail.  Well, let me listen to the voicemail.  I didn't realize, when Dr. Steve has a bad day, he starts doing characters.  Did any of you know this about Dr. Steve?  Like, you know, you didn't know this either, Eric.  And you have a pretty close relationship with the guy.  I talk to him, like, a couple times a week, and I've never heard him do a character.  When you go to doctors, and they tell you if you're, like, gonna live or die type of doctor, 
[03:34:00]  do you expect that they're the type of doctor that drinks and calls people up with characters out of nowhere on their voicemails?  No, I wouldn't think so.  Listen to the voicemail that Dr. Steve left for me.  And you tell me if this was a guy that you would entrust your life to.  Well, I was gonna call you and wish you a happy birthday.  There's no setup.  There's no name to the character.  This is just what the voicemail is.  This was what was left on my phone.  And I hope you have you good and well. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Well, I hope you don't eat too much cake and get a high blood sugar,  because you know what I can do, too?  You can do pretty bad things.  And I, Lord, I know it.  I'm just listening to this, and I'm going, wait, what?  And then I look down at the phone.  There's still 50 seconds left of this voicemail.  I don't know what he's doing.  Eric, have you heard anything like this from him?  No.  Was he drinking? 
[03:35:00]  No.  It was 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  He was at work.  That doesn't mean anything.  I guess.  I guess.  I don't mind my sugar so high.  I have to take me some insulin.  Well, they hear it all the time.  They're all telling me, Hermione, check your blood sugar.  And I'm like, well, all right.  I will.  And I check it, and it's all the time.  And they tell me, well, Hermione, if you don't stop eating cake, you're gone.  He's still talking about cake and blood sugar. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, do you understand the insanity?  Like, I felt like I was in, I didn't know where I was anymore, because I'd just woken up.  And I'm like, oh, a voicemail from Dr. Steve.  And this is all I hear.  I'm going, this is not, this does not sound like Dr. Steve.  He's just talking about birthday cake and insulin.  I mean, I guess that's medical stuff.  But he's just going on and on about eating too much cake.  Is this the character that has diabetes?  Is this trying to be weird for the sake of being weird?  I don't know.  And it wasn't even for broadcast.  It was for my voicemail. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, but he knew you were going to do something with it.  But that's not Dr. Steve.  He's not like a shock guy.  He's a doctor.  And he does a show where he takes calls and gives people medical advice that they can take  or not take.  That's his whole thing.  He doesn't do characters.  He's just, you know, you get in a weird mood.  He's just in a weird mood.  I guess so.  He's still talking about cake, by the way, for those that weren't sure what he was talking  about.  Still cake.  Oh, sorry.  What did you say?  I was going to say, do you think this is what he, how he copes when a patient dies? 
[03:36:30]  Maybe that's what happened.  He makes crank calls.  Maybe one of his patients was dead.  And so he started just calling people's voicemail.  Just drunk.  He started drinking because he was one of the ones that he actually liked and just started  doing this weird high pitched guy with diabetes character.  Sounds like Towley.  A little bit, but Towley, who's not a towel, just a person who eats cake and has high blood  sugar.  Order, take care of me.  He don't care if I eat some cake for once in a while.  Well, all right. 
[03:37:00]  Well, I hope you have it again.  Don't worry about me now.  I'll be fine.  Well, happy birthday to you.  Well, all right.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you, bye.  I'm starting to have serious questions about the people I surround myself with.  You've got Lady Trucker calling up and singing that really horrendous version of Sexy Happy  Birthday.  Dr. Steve is doing this weird high pitched diabetes guy character.  I really love to know more.  You've never heard him do a character like this, Eric. 
[03:37:30]  You've listened to all the weird medicine shows.  He doesn't do stuff like this.  No, he doesn't do this at all.  Why would he do it?  So he just does it on voicemails.  In fact, he gets mad at the people on his show when they try to do bits or characters  without him knowing.  He puts like an end to it.  He squashes it right there.  So for him to just call up people and start doing voices is totally out of character for  him.  And then I called him back and I guess he was with his family because he was at a fast  food drive-thru like Dr. Steve always is, Mr. Healthy.  And when he picked up the phone, he goes, hello. 
[03:38:00]  Still doing the character.  And I'm like, what is this?  The phone voice you do now is just trying to call you up and say thanks.  Oh, I'm just kidding, buddy.  What's the joke?  I don't understand.  Give me the creeps.  Brad in Mississippi.  Happy birthday, little Sammy.  Thank you.  It sounds like the old dude from the family guy that's always chasing Chris around.  I think Herbert's the name or something like that?  Maybe.  Maybe that's what he's doing.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:38:30]  I don't know.  Maybe that's the only character he's got.  It gives me the creeps.  He's a doctor.  He's supposed to be helping people.  Eh, well.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Oh, sorry.  Freak Dog.  Happy birthday, Sammy.  Thank you, Freak Dog.  Hey, play that clip again.  That sounds exactly like Paul Bearer.  It does.  I guess, but I really don't want to go to a doctor for life or death situations that does  a Paul Bearer to people on their voicemails. 
[03:39:00]  You can't say that.  Thank you, Freak Dog.  It's weird, man.  It's very strange.  Are you guys enjoying the birthday cake over there?  You know who the birthday king is, right?  Did you see my balloon that Roland brought in?  Look at all these extra crunchies.  I like how you've been holding out the whole time.  Well, I'm the birthday king.  I just wanted to make sure everybody knows.  I just wanted to make sure you're the king.  Thank you very much, Roland.  I feel like a king today, you know?  So, Opie tried to just sneak it in at the very end of the show.  And he told me, he goes, see?  Now you're not going to get any radio time for your birthday. 
[03:39:30]  And I was like, Opie, I got a whole show after this.  It's not going to be a problem for me.  This is all I want to talk about.  This is all I have to talk about.  It's great.  It's the beauty of being me.  Sam, there's an old show called Green Acres.  Yeah?  And there's a character on there called Mr. Haney.  Mr. Haney?  And I think that's what Dr. Steve is doing.  He's doing characters from Green Acres on my voicemail?  I think so.  He's lost it.  He's lost his mind.  A show that was on in the 60s.  I think that Dr. Steve is like, because he's got the Weird Medicine show. 
[03:40:00]  And he's got the podcast on Riotcast.  So he's becoming like, he's not just a guy.  He used to just come in and do a show like once every few months.  And it was just, you know, sometimes he'd call in or whatever.  But now he's doing shows like multiple times a week.  He's a doctor on the side.  Yeah, I think he's sort of becoming this broadcaster in his head.  Like this weird, like...  You think he's going Dr. Drew on us?  No, because Dr. Drew wouldn't even do that.  Dr. Drew has like integrity.  Dr. Steve is more like...  Well, his patients die too. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, Dr. Steve's patients are probably more expected to die.  But yeah, Dr. Drew, I don't think, would call people up in character.  It's like he wants to help people, even on the radio.  Yeah, that's a cruel idea.  I think, yeah, I think Dr. Steve wants to be the comic relief.  I think he views himself a little more like Patch Adams, except without the medical stuff.  Like he just wants to be the clown doctor, minus the doctor.  I guess it's something you could do.  What's up, Anthony?  Good morning, Sam. 
[03:41:00]  First of all, I would like to say happy birthday to the king of the after show.  That's right, I'm the birthday king of the after show, enjoying some delicious ice cream  cake, courtesy of Rolando's.  What up?  I would also like to know, does Troy have any more cool items to give away?  Troy, any more items?  I got a tweet last night that somebody finally got their vase.  I have a Jesse James book.  Yeah.  I have a signed, I have a Nikki Six photography book signed.  Mm-hmm.  And then I have to bring in another dead, ex-girlfriend's dead mother's vase. 
[03:41:30]  And I have a...  Oh, the punk rock gift pack, don't forget.  Yeah, but that has to go to a girl.  Okay.  Well, uh...  I think I'm going to give it to that girl that, uh, she called up before and she always  tweets at me.  Liz sets fire.  Well, she got to call up again.  Right.  Just give it to her.  But I think I'm going to give it to her.  All right.  Well, Anthony, do you want the Jesse James book or the Motley Crue book?  Uh, the Jesse James book.  All right.  You win that.  I'm putting you on hold.  Uh, Sal, why don't you take over the phones?  Because I would like to talk to the interns for a second.  I would like both interns to come in. 
[03:42:00]  Julie can come back in wherever she went.  And, uh, the other intern with glasses, who I think's name is Anthony.  Coincidentally, we've got Anthony from Opie and Anthony.  We've got Anthony who was just on the phone.  And intern Anthony.  So, uh, yeah, you want to send them both in?  They're coming.  Wait, somebody's got to give Sex Bagel a piece of cake.  No, they brought one in.  Oh, I bet they did.  That was probably priority number one for these interns.  The boss knows what, they know what the boss wants.  No, I'm not eating.  This guy, you didn't get a cake, did you?  No, no, no.  A cake.  Yeah.  Enjoy yourself. 
[03:42:30]  You're not having birthday cake, A-Rock?  You're going to disrespect the birthday king?  It's chocolate, dude.  There's vanilla in it.  I appreciate it, but I'm fine.  Just eat the icing.  Have a little bite.  I'm good.  Somebody's got to take Danny a piece of cake.  Give you a tummy upset?  Give Danny A-Rock's a piece.  A-Rock's not going to eat it.  Here, here.  Huh?  I just started eating A-Rock's a piece.  You already had a piece.  I didn't.  Oh, you didn't cut Julia a piece?  No, I didn't.  Okay, all right.  We'll then enjoy Eric's piece.  Listen, what's your name?  Anthony.  Anthony?  Oh, let me get that for you, Anthony. 
[03:43:00]  What do you think of the internship so far, Anthony?  Where do you see yourself going with this thing?  It's been a lot of fun so far.  How long have you been here?  This is my, I think, fourth day.  Fourth day.  Fourth big day.  Fourth day?  Didn't you start last week?  Well, Tuesday, but then we were off.  Oh, so it was just the one day.  So Tuesday, when, Tuesday, and then this Tuesday, when, Tuesday.  Where's Julie going?  I just asked for the fucking interns to come in here.  No, he's leaving.  Because Roland said this, it said him down to give Danny a piece of cake.  Why doesn't Roland just give Danny a piece of cake?  Did you see how many pieces of cake Roland had in his hand? 
[03:43:30]  I don't give a shit.  I was just talking to him.  He'll be back.  I don't care about Danny's piece of cake.  I was just being greedy.  You could throw out my piece of cake, too.  I was trying to talk to Julia about something.  Go, keep going.  Anthony, do you think he's stupid?  I don't want to stay.  Tell me, he's not here right now.  All right, he's, he's, he's, he's there, he's there.  You're not a dumb guy.  No, not really.  No.  You're pretty smart.  Ivy League educator.  Really?  Ivy League?  Where do you go to school?  It's not Ivy League yet. 
[03:44:00]  It's supposed to be.  Wagner.  I'm not fucking dumb either.  I'm talking to Anthony right now.  No, but it's like, you're not a dumb guy as opposed to fucking Julia.  But he wasn't, I don't know what he's talking about.  What are you pointing at, Eric?  I think he's pointing at headphones.  Telling him to get over at this mic and get headphones on.  Where do you go to school?  I go to Wagner in Staten Island.  Wagner in Staten Island.  That's not exactly Ivy League, is it?  It's going, it's going to be Ivy League soon.  Soon?  Ivy League pending.  Is that right?  Yes.  I had no idea.  I'm glad you're here to tell me. 
[03:44:30]  And what about you, Julie?  Go to NYU.  NYU is pretty, a little closer to Ivy League, I think.  A little bit, yeah.  Now, you always seem, you seem a little upset right now.  No, I'm good.  The cake is good.  Danny was in his office, but, I mean.  You seem angry.  Are you nervous?  Yeah, a little bit, honestly.  So you're not angry?  No, I'm not angry.  Okay, because I want good vibes in here.  I'm the, let me get this, I'm the birthday king.  Why didn't you put your headphones on?  Why are you having them like that?  I don't know, dude.  It's like, it's awkward to wear them.  Like, I'm sure I'll get used to it. 
[03:45:00]  He's nervous.  It's fourth day as an intern.  First time really kind of sitting down and being on the air.  That's, you know, I understand that.  Yeah.  We've all been there.  That's it.  You know.  What about you?  Well, Anthony, what do you want to do with your internship?  Well, this is actually another, this is one of the second internships that I've done.  One of the second internships?  One of the, well, the second internships.  What have been the other second internships that you've done?  I did an internship for Disney World.  Disney World?  What did you do there?  That's awesome.  I got to work in Hollywood Studios in the Rock and Roller Coaster.  Oh, I love the Rock and Roller Coaster. 
[03:45:30]  It's a lot of fun.  So what did you do?  I was, every part of the ride I worked on.  I greeted the guests.  Did you build it when it broke?  No.  Oh.  Not every part, then.  Not every part.  But I was in the control booth when we did go down and there was, we had to get people  off the ride.  You got like behind the scenes access.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is there any weird shit going on?  Not really.  Did anybody die while you were there?  Nobody did.  It's one of the more safer rides.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  It goes upside down.  We did have a possible heart attack, but it was...  While you were there? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I was actually in the control booth and the maintenance guy was calling for me and he  kept saying...  Why is he calling for you?  He should have called his weirdo Dr. Steve.  I was in the control room, the main control room, and the ride just went down.  All the lights come up.  And if he was calling down, he kept saying tower, but I wasn't used to being called tower  because there's tower tower and I was getting confused.  And he said, you got to call 911.  We have a possible heart attack.  And I had to call them.  And it was like my fifth day there.  And it was... 
[03:46:30]  And you were like, I didn't realize being in this room meant I was on heart attacks.  I don't know how to handle this situation.  He was fine.  I think he had a panic attack.  Because he was on the rock and roller coaster room and you never heard of Aerosmith before?  I guess not.  I mean...  I guess not.  He should go to like Six Flags where they have real roller coasters.  Freak the fuck out.  And it was indoors, too.  And he already shot out, so he was fine.  Yeah, I mean, once you speed up, that's kind of the whole big heart attack inducing part.  And he was on the highest part.  It's like 13 stories up.  And then we had...  Like the ambulance still had to do their thing and go up there. 
[03:47:00]  You had to stop the roller coaster mid-ride?  Yeah, it stopped.  Somebody pressed the emergency stop.  There's an emergency...  In the roller coaster?  Oh, yeah.  If somebody tries to like go in the tracks...  He tried to get out of the car?  No, no, no, no.  He was fine.  He was on the ride itself.  Okay.  Somebody tried to go inside of the track while people were boarding on the other trams.  So just coincidentally it stopped?  Right.  It had stopped and then that initiated.  Okay, so it stopped and that gave him a panic attack. 
[03:47:30]  Exactly.  Why the fuck did this roller coaster just stop?  Exactly.  We're so high up in the air right now.  Did the lights come on?  The lights...  All the lights came on.  That's why I was like, oh, shit.  Oh, and he goes like, holy fuck.  I had no idea what was going on.  If there's one thing you never want to happen while you're in control base is you don't  want the lights to turn on.  And they don't want that stuff at Disney World because they want to keep the illusion  alive.  Exactly.  Otherwise, it's a perfectly safe ride.  Isn't that a little scary that they have interns running the rides there?  You'd think.  They'd be like...  If they put the interns on heart attack duty?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  They should have like a doctor do that. 
[03:48:00]  And we were paid interns.  We were paid interns.  How much did they pay you?  Minimum wage minus one.  Very bad.  Pretty good cash.  Righteous bucks.  You know what I'm saying?  Did you get to ride for free?  Oh, yeah.  Every night.  Every night.  Did you?  Absolutely.  You rode the rock and roller coaster every night?  Yeah, you have to.  It's part of the thing.  You have to ride in the morning.  You test out the ride?  Absolutely.  That's the fucking awesomest internship ever.  This one's going to suck.  There's not one roller coaster in the whole building.  It's doing fine, though. 
[03:48:30]  And when was that?  That was last summer.  How did you end up doing that?  I actually started that internship a year ago, like two days ago.  How did you?  And I applied for Sirius before that.  That was a dumb move.  Definitely Disney World was the way to go.  It was fun.  It was a good time.  How did you end up doing that, though?  Like, you just said, like, oh, Disney World.  I love Disney World.  I was just looking for internships to do, and it seemed like a fun time.  Why not work at Disney World?  And it turned out to be correct, right?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:49:00]  That's incredible.  Do you get to go into any of the tunnels?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Under Magic Kingdom.  Oh, my God.  The tunnels under Magic Kingdom and Earth.  You should write a book revealing all the secrets.  I don't think I can.  I don't think that's allowed.  You've done all this.  Oh, I thought you meant because, no, I've pretty much said everything there is to say  right here just now in the last five minutes.  Yeah, I think we signed a disclosure.  I don't remember, actually.  Well, you understand that whether you write a book or go on a national radio show and just  start saying everything.  Yeah, but that wasn't part of that.  I think they were talking more of stuff.  Like, what's one secret that you couldn't tell?  I can't.  One.  Just one. 
[03:49:30]  They wouldn't be upset if it's one secret.  But I can't tell it.  I think I already have.  Probably the heart attack thing.  Mickey Mouse is going to come get me.  I don't know what's going to happen now.  Yeah, Walt Disney Jr., whoever is in charge over there.  Wow, that's pretty incredible.  So you lived in Orlando then?  I did, yeah.  I lived in Lake Buena Vista.  How'd you afford that?  They pay for it.  What?  Well, actually, we pay for it, but they have housing there.  They put you up?  Yeah, they have like three apartment complexeses around.  It's going to be a Lando area, and we pay for it out of our paycheck, but it's out there.  I wish I had done that internship instead of going to XM. 
[03:50:00]  You still can.  You can do a professional internship now.  I can do that?  Yeah?  I can quit this shitty thing and go to work at the Rock and Roller Coaster?  You wouldn't do it, though?  It's like fun, man.  You'd probably say it would be a bad career move for me.  All right, well, I'm going to think about it at least.  Does that sound like a pretty?  That sounds great.  It sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me.  It was a lot of fun.  What about you?  So what do you want to do?  So you're just here to see what happens here, or is this like a professional?  Well, I've been a fan of the show since 2009.  A friend of mine, he listens religiously. 
[03:50:30]  He would skip school for this show.  Do you like my contributions?  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.  And so you're just here to be like Disney World, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Done.  Life is awesome.  Done.  I love it.  What about you, Julie?  Well, I wasted a shitload of money on tuition, and so I took this semester.  What are you sitting there?  What are you twitching on over there?  I was playing with the tape.  Playing with tape.  Yeah, I can hear it.  Don't do that.  All right, sorry.  Knock it off.  Now, what do you mean?  So you wasted money on tuition.  Yeah, I'm taking a semester off to figure everything out. 
[03:51:00]  I've listened to Opie and Anthony since high school.  I used to put it on through two lectures.  So you have to be enrolled to intern?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm enrolled, but I'm like barely in school.  You're not taking any classes.  No.  So why not?  You don't like school?  No, not really.  I mean, it's like, you know, it just gets fucking pretentious and annoying after a while.  Yeah.  What year are you in?  I should be a senior, but like, I'm technically not anything right now.  Why don't you just do the last year?  It's a year.  What else are you doing?  Because, I mean, because you have to write a rationale and, you know, explain, like,  why you went to college and shit.  That's easy to do. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, I don't understand why you would do three quarters.  Well, what should I say then if it's easy to do?  I can't write it for you.  I mean, it's easy for you to do because it's your experience, right?  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I just don't understand why you would do three quarters of it and then be like, ah,  you did three years of it.  But you're a film major there, right?  Yeah, basically.  But if you look at my transcript, it's like classes and a million different things.  It doesn't make sense.  You know, my degree, that's a very hard department to get into.  A lot of people come from all around the world to be in the NYU film.  Yeah, that's what people say, but it's overrated, honestly. 
[03:52:00]  I don't know if you know this, but you know who graduated from NYU's film department?  You?  Spike Lee.  I know, dude.  I hate Spike Lee.  Well, you know what?  I'll tell you, I understand he may not be your cup of tea.  But as far as professionally, he's done all right with his degree.  You got to give him that.  I mean, he's fairly successful.  He's pretty great, actually.  He's Spike Lee.  Right.  He gets to go to every Knicks game in the front row.  Yeah.  And plus, he's met a lot of celebrities, probably fucked some of them, and he's had many hit 
[03:52:30]  moves.  Didn't he, like, punch Reggie Miller in the face?  And he punched.  Well, no, he didn't punch him, but he yelled at him.  He punched Reggie Miller.  There was a dispute there.  In his jaw.  Yeah, with uppercutting Reggie Miller in the face.  Without his degree, he wouldn't have been able to do that.  I don't think so.  I don't think he would have been.  I mean, he came from NYU film school.  He became a filmmaker.  Then he punched Reggie Miller in the face.  When was the last time you hung out with Reggie Miller?  Or punched him in the face?  Exactly.  Let alone punch him in the face.  Well, if you had a degree from NYU, and then you made a movie, then Reggie Miller might  be like, hey, Julie, let's go chill.  You'd be like, fuck you, Reggie Miller, and punch him in his face. 
[03:53:00]  Do the right thing.  Right.  Do the right thing, Reggie Miller.  Get on the bus.  We're going to Crooklyn.  Because I'm the inside man.  Did he do inside man?  Yeah, yeah, he did.  Okay, good.  Excellent.  He was nominated for a few Academy Awards.  Absolutely.  I think he's doing all right.  Call me Malcolm X.  He could keep going and going and going, you know?  Yeah, but for every Spike Lee, there's, you know, a thousand assholes.  A thousand Julies?  Oh, come on.  I don't know.  I'm just asking you.  But you don't like, so what are you going to do? 
[03:53:30]  I don't know.  Well, right now I'm interning here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're going one day at a time?  One day at a time, yeah.  I love it.  Listen.  I'm on the bus to not...  Well, you're not on the bus because Spike Lee finished.  He graduated.  Are you going to graduate?  Are you going to go back?  Yeah, probably.  I don't know.  You probably should.  I mean, why not?  Maybe I'll transfer to Marymount or something easy.  You hate NYU?  Yeah, I mean...  How are your grades?  Like, not good.  Why not?  I mean, I have like a 3.0 probably.  That's good.  It's acceptable.  What do you mean it's acceptable? 
[03:54:00]  It's like a B.  I would go crazy to get into the NYU film program.  I would be...  Go for it.  It's not that hard.  Yeah, but you're almost...  It's pretty hard.  I got turned down from there when I was in high school.  I didn't do very well in high school, though.  I didn't pay attention a lot.  I mean, but you...  You're almost Ivy League there.  Yeah, we're pending.  Pending.  Pending.  Pending right now.  Pending approval.  Was he one of those kids that locked himself up a couple years ago at NYU?  Did you lock yourself...  Oh, in a cafeteria?  Yeah.  Did you lock yourself up in the cafeteria?  No.  I don't even know.  What are you talking about?  There was a big protest. 
[03:54:30]  No, there were a couple kids who hung themselves in the library.  I wasn't talking about that.  I know there are suicides there at NYU, but there are rapes at Syracuse.  That's where I went, and I didn't get raped.  So, you know.  Yeah.  You take the good with the bad.  So what do you want to...  You don't know really what you want to get out of the internship.  No, not really.  I mean, I don't know.  I doubt they'll hire me at the end, but I'm still...  Why?  You've been here four days!  What type of attitude is that to come in here with?  Well, I mean, I'm just trying to be humble.  I'm hoping, actually, to get hired.  You know what?  I wrote a bunch of shit for the... 
[03:55:00]  The first day of my internship, you know what I thought?  I'll bet they'll fucking want to hire me after this is over.  Hell yeah.  That is really what I'm thinking.  I'm just trying to not be...  But then why would you go and say, yeah, they probably won't hire me?  Because you know what that makes me think?  Here's somebody we shouldn't hire.  Whereas Anthony's over there like, I ride roller coasters!  And I'm like, this kid's cool.  We should get the job.  We gotta hire him.  The internship is what you make out of it.  You know what I mean?  No, yeah.  I mean, I spent the whole weekend writing a bunch of shit.  Bits?  Yeah.  Are they good? 
[03:55:30]  Some of them are really good.  Some of them suck.  Some of them suck?  Yeah.  But some of them are really good.  Yeah.  Have you given any of them to anybody here?  I was planning to do that after the after show.  That's no problem.  You give them to me?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  I'll take a look at them.  Now, here's the thing.  We had Stump Brain call in.  You guys know who Stump Brain is?  You're 2009, probably not.  Are you a fan of the show?  Yeah, yeah.  How long have you been listening for?  Since high school, so 2006, yeah.  2006.  So, K-Rock.  Stump Brain was our executive producer at K-Rock when we did the mornings at K-Rock and  then did the walkover to XM. 
[03:56:00]  Well, he called in.  He's always been a very politically minded guy.  And he called in.  He's one of the few staff members to have left the show that's actually a friend of the  show still.  So, he's a good guy.  And he called in today.  And he was calling in from the Democratic National Convention.  And during some of the breaks, we were talking about how good that was.  And how, you know, we used to have a little more man on the street stuff going on.  And at least, you know, be aware of what's happening.  This could be a great job for the interns to do.  You know, at least having somebody who's aware of the events that are happening. 
[03:56:30]  Now, do either of you have aspirations to be on the air or to do bits like that?  Yeah.  You do.  Anthony, do you?  Maybe it's something you both can do.  You know what I mean?  You know, what do you mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you think you could do it better?  I mean, I have a performing arts background.  Oh, you do?  So, I think.  All right.  So, you could do a character.  You could perform.  You could take on a role. 
[03:57:00]  Do you have a performing arts background?  Yeah, a little bit.  I also have a film background and a screenwriting background.  I, too, have a film background.  You do?  Not a screenwriting background.  He's got me there.  He's got you.  I can't do that.  So, you can film him?  Yeah, I can film him.  If worst case scenario.  All right.  Well, here's what we need to do, then.  And, uh, E-Rock, is this okay?  Can I assign them this?  He's not listening.  This is a problem with your boss.  Sometimes he doesn't listen.  Sorry, somebody's in here.  Who's in there?  Pepper.  Oh.  Tell him I said hey.  Sam says hi.  Hi, Sam!  People love it when they hear a little bit of Pepper on the after show.  That little bit is going to just... 
[03:57:30]  People are going to flip the fuck out that they heard Pepper.  Um, can I assign them this without it being a problem?  I don't see why not.  Okay.  I want you interns to get on the ball, get on the bus, as we discussed earlier, Julie,  and, uh, start, uh, becoming very aware of what's going on, especially in New York that  we can get to that we can do some man-on-the-street stuff with.  Uh, for instance, Fashion Week has just started.  Maybe that's a good opportunity for you guys to go down.  You know what I mean?  Can you guys think of any ideas for fun stuff you could do at Fashion Week? 
[03:58:00]  Like, you don't have to give me the ideas now, but do you think over the course of today  you might be able to kind of brainstorm stuff?  Well, I know a lot of girls go down there to get their makeup done.  They get, like, a free makeover.  We call it to get their fashion on.  Right, to get their fashion on.  Maybe one of us could get our fashion on.  Would you want to get...  Sure.  That's kind of...  You'd like to just dress up and maybe put a little dress on and everything.  For the show, anything.  Julie, was that kind of the vibe that you were going with, or something different for you?  Um, I'll film Anthony wearing a dress.  Wearing a dress, okay.  All right, so you guys can team up and work together. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  All right, here's what I want.  I want you guys to come up with something for Fashion Week.  And, going forward, for the rest of the semester, I need you both to be on the ball with what  is going on.  To be coming at me all the time.  Hey, this is happening here.  This is happening there.  What do you think?  Would this be good for the show?  It's Comic-Con next month.  That's right.  That's right.  It is Comic-Con next month.  And then, we'll start sending you out to do stuff, or if, you know, other people want  to do it, or whatever.  That way, we're informed.  That way, we might have some bits coming to the air. 
[03:59:00]  Stuff like that.  And if you come back and it's good, then we'll put it on the air.  And if you come back and it's bad, then you'll still be able to learn from it.  So, everybody's a winner.  What do you guys think?  Sounds good.  Is this going to be a fun thing for you guys?  Yeah, definitely.  What's Roland pointing at?  Roland, you know I'm the birthday king.  Did you hear about that, Roland?  I know you need it.  Hmm?  I crowned you a birthday king.  What do you think of, well, very good interns, then.  You are dismissed.  Can you get napkins for this?  Yep.  Your first assignment will be to get some napkins and to help Roland clean up a little bit. 
[03:59:30]  But, that's your new thing.  So, this is exciting for you guys, huh?  Yes.  These interns, I don't know about them.  I don't know about them.  Roland, what did you think of Anthony talking?  He went on the air today and said you piss him off a little bit on the after show,  because he has no idea what you're saying.  I don't know.  Hey, Anthony, how are you going to just want to go?  Okay, you did that on purpose a little bit.  You trailed off on purpose a little bit there.  Because it also makes me feel like I'm not doing my job as a host,  because I want the audience to know what you're talking about.  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  Do you think, have you ever thought about speech classes?  Like, were you in speech therapy as a kid?  No, I took speech at school.  All right, so yes would be the answer.  You said no.  Speech therapy is speech class.  Not like a psychiatrist.  I did, but I know the teacher and the professor in college so much.  They just, like, my college professor said, I may have to fail you.  And then I go, I heard you're a U2 fan.  He goes, yeah, I got two tickets.  And he passed me.  Okay, I thought you just said, I heard you're a U2 fan. 
[04:00:30]  U2.  And I was like, what, are you just showing videos?  No, U2 fan.  Okay, so what you said, for those that didn't understand, was that you got your teacher in college, your speech teacher, tickets to U2 so he would pass you.  Yeah, in the side of the heart during the elevation tour.  But don't you feel like all you did there was really rob yourself of a good education?  No, I learned how to negotiate.  That's true.  You know, you learned how to negotiate without knowing how to speak clearly.  Yeah, and he understood everything I said.  He goes, yes, yes.  What is it that trips you up? 
[04:01:00]  I'm just lazy sometimes.  I don't care.  You think you're actually too lazy to speak a sentence?  I'm just tired.  It's like, I have to deal with so much shit.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm shutting down for a minute.  So you choose to shut down at the moments that you're speaking.  Correct.  You're like, have you ever had trouble with, like, publicists and stuff being like, I don't know what you're saying right now, Roland?  No, half of them I grew up with are all friends.  The other thing I think, like, newer publicists would probably not want to be rude to you.  So they would pretend to understand what you're talking about.  Can you tell when somebody is pretending to know what you're saying? 
[04:01:30]  100%.  Because I slip in some words that I know I would never get away with otherwise.  So when you start to get a hint of them just kind of placating you.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, oh, okay.  I'm going to slip in, like, penis dough.  Penis dough?  Penis dough.  Well, you slip in the phrase penis dough, D-O-U-G-H.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, we're talking about over there, the penis dough over there.  They go, what?  I got nothing.  What?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cool.  We can work on that. 
[04:02:00]  You should.  You should start seeing if they catch you doing that in the studio.  You should do that here.  Yeah, here.  Just say that way.  And especially because it's the end of the show.  So I don't know if Ant's still listening because he's probably at home already.  Next time you go in studio, just for the after show listeners, sneak in penis dough.  Penis dough.  Penis dough.  Well, where'd you get penis dough from?  I don't know.  Where'd I get half the shit from?  I don't know.  You get those dicks in the ass and you come up with something.  You heard Dr. Steve's voicemail.  Yeah.  Do you think Dr. Steve was just having a day of getting dicks in the ass? 
[04:02:30]  And so he just got weird?  Because sometimes you get, you like, when you have a bad day, you start exploding cans  of soda in your office and pouring bottles of water on your head.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I do.  I definitely know what I'm talking about.  I've seen it many times.  I don't do that.  Now, do you think this is Dr. Steve's sort of way of unleashing the fury?  I think it's like he had a tough day and he probably cracked a few jokes and he'll be  laughed at and he goes, fuck everybody.  Yeah.  I'm going to call Sam and this is stellar material.  I'm just going to get crazy.  Yeah.  This is going to kill. 
[04:03:00]  And so you think that he was thinking, and Sam's going to think this is hilarious.  This is hilarious.  And fuck everybody throughout the day that didn't laugh at this.  It wasn't hilarious.  It was weird.  He probably told some patrons, like, hey, he did that impression.  The patrons are like, am I okay?  Am I dying?  All right.  He's like, no, I did it for a couple radio guys that I know and they were really into  it.  So, you know, if it's not your thing, it's not your thing.  But trust me.  It's funny.  It is.  I'm the birthday king.  I'd like to thank everybody for being in my kingdom today. 
[04:03:30]  Roland, thank you for putting all this celebration together.  You're welcome, Penis Joe.  I heard the penis, though.  It's the end of that.  Uh, E-Rock, thank you for allowing me to assign the interns a new task.  You're very welcome.  Troy, thank you for giving that, uh, caller a book.  And thank you, Jimmy, for calling him hoofs.  Thank you, Jimmy, for calling him hoofs.  And thank you to the Ron and Fez show for coming up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Thank you all for the birthday wishes.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. 
[04:04:00]  For real this time. </pre>
