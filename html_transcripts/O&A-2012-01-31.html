<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts expressing their disappointment at their sixth-place finish in the Shorty Awards and their exclusion from Radio Row at the Super Bowl, despite their prominent position on Sirius XM.  This led to a humorous discussion about the perceived unfairness of the situation, focusing on the preferential treatment of smaller, less successful shows.  They then launched into a detailed recounting of a disastrous past radio promotion involving a giveaway of a dilapidated Mustang, playing a news clip showcasing the winner’s outrage and the station's clumsy attempts at damage control. The hosts reminisced about the absurdity of the situation and the subsequent lawsuit.  The conversation shifted to a critical review of Super Bowl commercials, particularly a poorly-received Matthew Broderick *Ferris Bueller* ad and a JCPenney commercial featuring excessive screaming.  A listener then called in, providing a link to the news coverage of the Mustang debacle.  This segued into discussions about a cancer patient giving away his Super Bowl tickets after a breakup, and a spooky listener anecdote about Siri accidentally calling Patrice O'Neill. The show concluded this segment with lighthearted banter about *Big Miracle* and Drew Barrymore's acting career.

The next segment started with a prank call where a listener, Craig, was tricked into believing he'd won $100,000, only to receive a candy bar.  This led to a discussion of "bicuriousness," followed by a host singing a song later identified as from Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane’s podcast.  The hosts discussed various podcasts and showcased a video of a wheelchair-bound man singing karaoke, analyzing its comedic merit.  A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's delayed arrival due to a flight delay involving a disabled Delta plane and his subsequent frantic search to retrieve his laptop left on the plane.  The show also covered a push-up contest judged by "Mars," a Super Bowl bet between the mayors of New York and Boston, Jack White's new album, and a lengthy discussion about Norton's recent stand-up performance in Tempe, Arizona, including his interactions with Joe Perry and failed attempt to meet Madonna.  This evolved into conversations about Daryl Hammond's book, revealing details about Hammond's childhood trauma, the hosts' family mental health issues, and a darkly comedic hypothetical movie based on one host's family.  The segment concluded with a discussion of UFC fights on Fox and a promised Cowhead Show clip featuring an interview with a woman who drank donkey semen.

The following segment began with a discussion of Dana Carvey's career and his move to Fox, followed by an analysis of Chael Sonnen's post-UFC fight promo, comparing it to Superstar Billy Graham's old promos and touching on potential CM Punk and Vince McMahon involvement in UFC/WWE cross-promotion.  A significant portion involved the *Fear Factor* contestant who drank donkey semen; a clip of an exclusive interview with her, detailing the taste and smell, was played, with a caller from NBC offering their perspective on the network's decision to not air the segment.  Jim Norton then discussed his upcoming Grammy coverage for Sirius XM. The conversation meandered through celebrity gossip about Bruce Springsteen, Jay Leno, and various golfers, and the hosts' past experiences collecting baseball cards and wrestling figures.  The latter half featured an in-studio interview with Stephen Van Zandt, discussing his Netflix show *Lilyhammer*, his role in *The Sopranos* (including graphic descriptions of scenes and behind-the-scenes details), the challenges of working in Norway, and balancing his acting and music careers. The conversation also touched upon American and Norwegian cultural differences, the show’s ending, a video of Mitt Romney singing, Louis C.K.'s new CBS pilot, and Jim Norton's newfound appreciation for the Ramones, including a mention of a Foo Fighters/Led Zeppelin Ramones mashup.

The final segment, featuring Stevie Van Zandt as a guest, started with a discussion about *Lilyhammer*, including Van Zandt's feelings about potentially taking jobs from trained actors. A significant portion focused on Roland, a superfan of Bruce Springsteen (and Van Zandt) present in the studio, whose extreme fandom and inability to recall meeting Springsteen provided much of the humor.  Van Zandt recounted an anecdote about a missed opportunity for Roland to get a picture with Springsteen, and they compared Van Zandt’s "comfortable, low-level" celebrity to Springsteen's overwhelming fame.  The conversation covered Van Zandt’s various projects:  his Sirius XM radio shows, syndicated radio show, and work on *Lilyhammer*.  He discussed the creative process of *Lilyhammer*, working with Norwegian actors, and his favorite Springsteen song ("Youngstown"). He also discussed the E Street Band's dynamic and how they keep their live shows exciting by changing the setlist every night.  The segment included a humorous exchange with Jim Norton, who jokingly auditioned for *Lilyhammer*, and concluded with promotions for *Lilyhammer*, Van Zandt’s radio shows, and Victory Motorcycles.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I worked really hard.  You turn on the microphone?  All they heard was, and this year I worked really hard.  I love that.  Dr. Gay got caught his pants down a little bit.  No, I waited.  If I turn it on a little sooner. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, boy.  Hilarity would have been serious.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where the bitching never stops.  You scamps get together.  You guys got a form of union or something.  Yeah.  Tell these people what's up.  Oh, that was funny.  Yeah, Friday, Friday.  Really?  What happened?  Is it Friday?  I thought it was.  What happened?  Damn, that would be nice.  Yeah.  Oh, please don't bother. 
[00:01:00]  Why?  Don't do that.  Sixth place.  What?  You're still at the table.  Oh.  What do you mean?  Sixth place.  Yeah, please don't bother.  Don't bother what?  Make sure I move down the list.  Oh.  Of a YouTube star on the table.  Yeah, I don't want to be part of the big table.  But you've got to be at the table.  I'm too shy to be at the big table.  We're all going to be at the big table.  Yeah.  At the big awards show.  The Shorty Awards.  I can't wait.  Sam Roberts is still number one.  Sam is number one?  You're number one?  I'm number one by probably over 700 votes.  Damn.  Wow. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I told you.  My fucking fans are coming to the proverbial table.  I love how we're not even going for radio.  No.  We're giving that category to Sam.  I appreciate that.  Why not give it to the guy that has 10 shows and doesn't get paid for any of them?  Oh, boy.  Well.  I think the guys might have been talking about that right before.  Oh.  Oh, is that what the...  They might have.  They might have been talking.  I didn't...  We feel like the money might start flowing any moment now.  Yeah, yeah.  Raises right around the corner.  The guys might get raises. 
[00:02:00]  Right around the corner.  Bonuses, everything.  Yeah.  Like the old days.  Like the 50s.  What is it?  The Shorty Awards.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Remember.  I'm right where I want to be.  Just out of placing.  No, sixth place, you're in placing.  Oh, then I got to get pushed down to seventh.  Oh, no.  Please push me down to seventh place.  Oh, no, no.  My videos are not worthy.  Everyone's got to be.  I'm not worthy to be at the big table with the rest of the guys.  It's going to be great.  Yeah.  Yeah, get up there, give a speech until they play to get the fuck out of here music.  Sure.  Come on. 
[00:02:30]  I can't listen to Sirius XM because I'm hearing a lot of shows at the Super Bowl.  Oh, man.  Did you hear driving in?  I know you listen to 1010 Wins.  Yeah.  John Montone from 1010 Wins has gone to the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  He does.  You know, we love John, but let's face it.  Yeah.  He does one minute of radio.  About potholes.  Every hour.  Yeah.  Just dumb stuff.  As John said, the potholes are getting deeper.  I'm John Montone. 
[00:03:00]  All right, John.  One of these guys head to Indianapolis for the Super Bowl.  I think they're starting.  I think the NFL guys, some of them are starting.  No, I mean, like, you know, you know, you know, the guys that don't even do radio shows  but feel like they have to be there.  Don't they go for Super Bowl week?  Because they got a schmooze with potential clients.  Schmooze-ish.  One of those guys going.  Schmooze-ish.  I think today and Wednesday-ish.  Really?  Well, that's when the schmoozing starts, the parties start.  I love that we finally had them in a quarter, me and Ann. 
[00:03:30]  We're like, why are we going to the Super Bowl?  We're a big show around Sirius XM.  We're big stars.  And then we listed everyone that's going that have even less sports knowledge than us.  Yeah.  Horrible shows.  Terrible.  Nowhere is near the amount of listeners as we do.  Not even close.  So we had them in a corner, and then these weasels, they always have an explanation.  Always.  And then you can't call them out on their explanation.  Oh, we didn't think you wanted to be part of Radio Row.  Well, it's Radio Row. 
[00:04:00]  It's just a bunch of radio stations and people at these big, long tables.  And we wouldn't even have approached you with something like that.  Oh, is that why you didn't approach us with something like that?  Oh, you think too much of us.  Yeah, don't give us the opportunity to...  You know, what a hassle it is to go, yes, or no.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we did Radio Row for a few years.  Not at the Super Bowl, obviously.  We've never gone in 17 years of broadcasting.  Never.  We can't figure out how to get to the Super Bowl. 
[00:04:30]  Never.  And I kind of like the Radio Row because we end up fighting other radio shows.  It's fun.  We get to be obnoxious.  We go on other radio shows.  Yeah, we have them come on our show.  Right.  Mix it up a little.  We usually take over Radio Row and turn it into one big party for us.  It's a lot of fun when we're a little too loud and the people next to you are going,  could you keep it down?  And then we just laugh.  Yeah.  It's fun.  Only small-time radio shows are on Radio Row.  For instance, Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, see.  And Jim Rome.  Yeah.  A little show called Jim Rome. 
[00:05:00]  He's on Radio Row.  But they're like, oh, we didn't want to approach you with that.  We didn't think you would agree to that.  So we just decided not to ask you.  Oh, okay.  Mad Dog.  What?  Mad Dog's on Radio Row?  Radio Row.  Sounds like Radio Row is like the VIP.  Yeah, that's the place to be.  So what happened?  Sway on Radio Row.  Like, logically, why is Rosie there and we're not?  Well, she's doing this show Friday from 12 to 2 p.m.  Two hours.  Is it how big lesbian women enjoy the Super Bowl? 
[00:05:30]  Well, it's a special edition of Rosie Radio featuring celebrity guests live from Radio Row in Indianapolis on Friday from 12 to 2 p.m.  It's actually promoted live from Radio Row.  It's written as a promo.  Like, hey, this isn't just anywhere.  She's broadcasting from Radio Row.  And they were like, nah, you guys don't.  What happened?  That was such an excuse, wasn't it?  Please.  And then what are we supposed to say? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, thanks.  Thanks for protecting us from Radio Row.  Yeah, thanks for not asking us.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I think what we said was, but we would do Radio Row.  Yeah.  Oh, we didn't.  We.  Oh.  Oh, well, we'll remember that for next year.  He made the icky face when he mentioned it in the meeting.  It's like, Radio Row.  He goes, Radio Row, you didn't want to.  And he crunched his nose up and went like, you don't want Radio Row.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  A lot of big name shows are down there, so enjoy their broadcast from Indianapolis. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  We can have Super Bowl coverage from New York.  17 straight years.  That's what we're doing.  You know, anyone could go to the Super Bowl and do coverage.  We're going to be in New York, where the Giants are from.  Right.  Can I tell you the closest I got to going to a Super Bowl?  How close was that?  I was in Buffalo, New York.  I was doing, what was I doing back then?  Overnights slash mornings. 
[00:07:00]  I was helping the morning guys out a little bit.  And I got involved with a promotion.  Did I ever tell you this one?  Oh, no.  You know how Buffalo, it's really cold in the winter.  Well, how cold?  Oh, yeah.  And I would say it was almost single digits or low teens for this particular Super Bowl.  I don't remember who they were playing.  Because I was up there for three out of the four.  And we were broadcasting from a bar.  Nice, right?  This is the closest I got.  Sure is.  And we got a hot tub that we put outside the bar. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, boy.  And every time the Bills scored, we all had to jump in the hot tub.  But there was local TV.  Hey, of course there was.  And covering this game.  Oh, boy.  Wait till you hear this story.  And there were rumors that, you know, the national coverage was going to pick up on it.  Did they?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I don't know the answer to that.  I bet.  Because we were told they were going to, like, go to the hot tub if the Bills scored. 
[00:08:00]  To see us all jumping in like idiots in the freezing cold weather.  But that was the closest I got to a Super Bowl broadcast, man.  That's pretty good.  That sounds fun.  That's pretty good, right?  Well, you weren't near the Super Bowl, though.  But that's the closest.  That's the problem.  I was broadcasting for one of the teams that was in it.  We had a Super Bowl party.  And we had a wacky event.  You need to be near the Super Bowl.  So, you can't just, you know.  I'm just telling you. 
[00:08:30]  That's.  I would think.  That's the closest I got.  Yeah?  After many, many years of broadcasting.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  It's one of those promotions.  You do it.  And then you sit there in the hot tub going, now what?  We look like idiots.  Whoa!  Remember the event we used to do in Boston with the pool for St. Paddy's Day? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, with the green fucking...  Oh, look, it's green.  It's St. Paddy's Day.  This is crazy.  I guess, what was the broadcast?  There were shamrocks at the bottom of this, like...  Right.  It was a pretty impressive pool.  It was one of those above ground pools that you kind of see in a lot of people's backyards.  Yeah, they're inflatable, so they're a little bigger than just a kiddie pool. 
[00:09:30]  St. Paddy's Day, still cold in the Boston area.  You get a bunch of shamrocks.  You get the 10th caller for about three and a half weeks straight.  Wonderful.  They come down to the live broadcast, and they get the opportunity to jump into the freezing  cold pool.  Fantastic.  And grab a shamrock with a number on it, which gives you a prize.  Ah, yes.  And one of the shamrocks was worth a lot of money, or a big prize.  I don't remember.  A big prize, like the fucking Mustang? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Could you find that news piece?  But, just to finish this up, remember they were like, well, it's St. Paddy's Day, we  got to get the pool water green.  Yeah, yeah, because it's St. Paddy's Day, everything's going to be green.  But they obsessed about trying to get the water green, and you just can't.  You can't get that much water green.  No.  So, it was barely a tinge of green.  Right.  Didn't even fit.  It was horrible.  But, the biggest one that we did up in Boston, we gave away, was it a Mustang yet? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I believe it was a classic Mustang.  Why, though?  Why were we giving this away?  Was it like...  It was one of those key things, where you turn the key, and if the car starts, they win  it.  Was it the one where they had to keep their hands on it?  No.  No, that was a different thing.  They all got a key.  They all got a key, right?  It's a lame radio promotion that a million radio stations have done.  You give away keys for this promotion, because it's a car.  It takes like three or four months.  Oh, yeah.  It's a long, long...  You get a key that could start the car. 
[00:11:00]  You line up everybody, and one by one, they try their keys in the ignition, and the one  that starts it...  They get to drive away, or...  Well, the first problem was, you know, as the radio station, you know which person has  the key.  Right.  And that person stepped into the Mustang, turned the key, and the car did not start.  Nothing.  Meaning, holy fuck, this is the key that's supposed to start the car.  And the whole gist of...  Because it was a clunker.  The whole gist of the excitement of these things is when the person gets in, and you 
[00:11:30]  hear...  You're like, whoa, it started!  Right.  Remember Dave Douglas?  Of course.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  We were on Afternoon Drive.  They were teasing that there was going to be a massive contest announcement.  Yeah.  And right up until 10, 15 minutes before we had to announce the big contest, we didn't  have a contest.  No.  Because the person that was going to give us the car, I think, fell through.  So they had to scramble to find another one, hence the major problem that ensued. 
[00:12:00]  And then, Boston TV blamed me and you.  Yep.  Because it was our shift that was picking the winner, finally.  You know, having everyone line up with their keys.  Yeah, so it was Opie and Anthony's phony fucking piece of shit car giveaway.  Right, right.  Not the station.  It was more like Opie and Anthony's sock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then the lady sued the radio station.  It's always great when you do a contest where the listener wins and sues the station. 
[00:12:30]  Because they were expecting a little more.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was supposed to be a classic Mustang.  It was that sports bar right off Route 9.  Yeah.  Heading into Boston.  I forgot the name of it.  Yeah, the one with the satellite dish on the roof that you always saw.  Yeah, it was a classic Mustang, supposedly.  And it was refurbished.  Right.  All redone and everything.  And that was how it was billed.  And it turned out to be...  A dud.  A lemon.  A lemon.  A thrown together, last minute spray paint over the rust. 
[00:13:00]  And hope it starts, which it didn't.  They literally had to tow it out of the parking lot.  I think she had to.  She had to tow it.  Because we all left.  We're done with our broadcast.  And she's just standing in the parking lot with this Mustang that doesn't start.  This piece of shit.  Me and Opie are just like, well, our job here is done.  See you later.  He fucking bolted.  I think we went inside and drank a little bit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And just shook our heads again.  And then I think she had to get a tow truck. 
[00:13:30]  And then, oh boy, did she get a lawyer.  Yep.  And I think they ended up having to pay handsomely.  Yeah.  I mean, they promised her a certain thing and didn't come through with it.  No one has the news clip.  The news clip is classic.  It used to be up online.  And if anyone has it, could you please send it to us so we can fucking howl with laughter?  Fantastic, man.  So anyway.  Yeah.  Did you see the Super Bowl commercials?  Yeah, I saw two of them.  The two that count, I guess, I saw.  Kind of smart marketing. 
[00:14:00]  I think this is the first year.  Maybe they did it last year because social networking was pretty damn hot last year as well, obviously.  But they're releasing the commercials before Sunday.  Extended versions, too.  I guess they've been doing this for a couple years now that I think about it.  Yeah, probably.  But you release the commercial, you know, week of the Super Bowl, you get everyone watching.  Yeah.  The one commercial instead of it being thrown in with the rest of them.  The Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller thing is rough, isn't it?  That is just like... 
[00:14:30]  He's being praised for this.  Yeah, of course he is.  By the yes-men and cronies and Hollywood people.  But I think fans of Ferris Bueller's Day Off are looking at it as, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Danny had a great tweet about it.  What is that?  Everything you were in love with will turn out to be just shit on.  Yeah.  It was a great little tweet.  I'm paraphrasing.  Well...  But it definitely put the point across.  The problem with this whole thing was, where's Cameron?  Yeah, yeah.  You need Cameron.  You need Cameron. 
[00:15:00]  Well, Matthew Broderick doesn't like Cameron anymore.  I guess Cameron said, I ain't doing this shit.  Oh, really?  You think that's what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's a Super Bowl commercial, though.  That's good exposure.  Is it?  It just kind of, I don't know, ruins the whole memory of the innocence of Ferris Bueller's  Day Off.  And they're so out of touch that...  They're so out of touch that it's the agent?  Yeah.  Matt and Matthew Broderick? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Like, who gives a fuck if our agent is mad at us?  So Matthew Broderick is hiding from his own agent?  That's just dumb.  It's a reverse of us, because I think our agent's hiding from us.  Of course he is.  I've been emailing him and texting him.  He hasn't gotten back to me.  Nah, he's...  I don't know what that's all about.  I don't know what it is, either.  I have to check my bank accounts, see if he took off to fucking Thailand or something.  But, uh...  Boop, boop.  Why can't they just make him, like, a working Joe?  And he's hiding from his boss. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, it doesn't have to be...  Well, they had to make it Matthew Broderick, so...  I don't know.  Why do they have to make it Matthew Broderick?  Exactly.  I don't know.  Why can't he just be the first Bueller guy growing up?  And now he's got a shitty job like most of us.  That would have been good.  He's not a fry cook on Venus.  He ends up just with a shitty fucking job.  Yeah.  So the concept where he's Matthew Broderick and he's hiding from his agent, first of all,  that's just stupid.  Yeah.  Someone should have fucking spoke up in the meeting and said, this isn't going to work.  That was dumb.  The Seinfeld one I liked better.  You like the Seinfeld one?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see the ziplines? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Who talked about ziplines on this very show?  Ziplines through Manhattan.  I'm telling you, man.  I think it's going to take a little longer, but I'm telling you, I think you're going to  see ziplines in Manhattan eventually.  I'm telling you.  That would be horrific.  Why?  Like Spider-Man on your way through the fucking streets and shit.  Well, that's why it's going to take a while.  They've got to figure out how to make it extremely safe.  But you want to talk about tourist dollars.  Good luck.  Wouldn't you zipline through Manhattan if you could?  From building to building?  I would love it.  Huh?  That would be fun. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck yeah.  Seinfeld visits that very concept in his commercial.  He certainly does.  His is a little better.  But still, I don't like those.  You know, he slipped in the soup, Nazi.  Yeah.  It was kind of like, leave those precious characters alone.  Here's Matthew Broderick.  I don't know if it's going to play well on the radio.  Didn't play well on the video.  That's for sure.  All right.  I'm not sure what it is.  I guess I'll be okay. 
[00:17:30]  I'm calling the studio, Matthew.  You're not shooting today.  No.  People are depending on me.  Movies bring so much joy.  Stop.  It's done.  Just get some rest.  Diva.  He bought it.  How can I handle work on a day like today?  One of the worst performances in my career, and he never doubted it for a second.  Hi, can I get my CRV brought up, please?  I've got a lot to do today.  Roderick. 
[00:18:00]  Roderick.  You have excellent taste in automobiles.  He's driving at the CRV.  The things you have to do.  Sometimes you've got to live a little.  Calm yourself, woman.  He's playing at the fair.  Matthew, you poor thing.  You sound awful.  Sees his agent next to him in a car.  Yeah, it's some of the classic scenes from the movie, and it's been just, you know, bastardized for... 
[00:18:30]  It's all right.  But, I mean, they're praising it like, oh, my God, this is going to just play so well Sunday.  I don't...  People are going to love this.  I don't like it.  And why is he in the museum staring at the walrus and...  That was a scene in the...  Yeah, I know, but it was with...  With Cameron, right?  With Cameron and the Monet, I think.  Yeah.  Where's Cameron?  That's what I kept saying the whole time.  I think Monet was nearsighted. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know.  Are we at the point where we just hate everything?  Yes.  You think?  Yes!  Thank God!  Why is that?  It's so freeing.  Because we're jaded and fucking cynical, and we've just been shit on so much, and they're  pouring shit out to people, and people embrace it, and we're the few that look and go,  no, no, that stinks!  We're so in the minority.  I think the majority of the people will be just lapping up this first Bueller commercial.  Because they don't look at the original movie like you get in depth, and really it becomes 
[00:19:30]  part of your upbringing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Being a child of the 80s, you know.  Child of the 80s right here, too.  Me and you, brother.  Sure.  Children of the 80s.  You know what else?  And I tweeted this last night.  I am livid pissed at a commercial.  It's for a JCPenney, I'll let you know, because of this commercial, and I haven't been to  a JCPenney, but I will not go to a JCPenney because of this commercial. 
[00:20:00]  You wouldn't go before you saw the commercial.  Exactly.  I don't even know what they sell at JCPenney.  I don't know either, I don't care.  Is that like a Macy's?  Yeah, something like that.  It's a montage of people going to their mailboxes, opening envelopes, and getting coupons with  sales on them and everything like that.  And it's all them screaming. 
[00:20:30]  Screaming.  And it's probably the most annoying commercial I've ever seen.  Especially if you're a guy like me that likes to sleep with the TV on, you keep it a little  low.  That comes on very loud, and it's horrifying.  It's like your nails on a chalkboard.  Annoying.  So fucking annoying.  So it wakes you up in the middle of the night.  It wakes you up, and even when you're up just watching a show, I can't, I wince, my head 
[00:21:00]  turns.  I'm like, stop it!  Is this it?  Yeah, this is it.  I don't know if I've seen this yet.  Crank it up, you'll hate it.  No!  This isn't even the worst one.  No!  Why are they screaming?  I guess they're going to tell us at the end of the spot. 
[00:21:30]  No!  They don't even tell you?  No.  Enough is enough.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  What does that mean?  It means they've come up with the most annoying fucking commercial ever, and I can't take  it.  They give you a date, so they're going to tell you on that date, I guess?  Their thing, I believe that their thing is that they're eliminating coupons and sales,  and they're going to make their prices always low.  Oh, really?  What?  What kind of a fucking...  What happened?  What kind of a fucking carny move is that?  What happened then?  Stop it. 
[00:22:00]  Fuck.  That's why they're screaming, no, no, no, with the sales and the 25% coupons and coupons  in there.  Well, you know what?  That screaming is fucking infuriating.  Ant?  Yeah?  Kevin from Connecticut.  It's Kevin from C-O-N-N on Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  One word.  I see his call there.  I see his call there.  He fucking rules.  He found the...  The link?  The link to the Mustang story.  Yeah, Kevin.  Good move.  Hold on.  Hey, Kevin. 
[00:22:30]  Good morning, guys.  Where'd you find it?  Because we couldn't find it on YouTube anymore.  I just typed in ONA Mustang lawsuit.  Lawsuit.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Stay on the line for a second.  Oh, boy.  Opie and Anthony Old School ONA Classic Mustang.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Yes.  WCBV-TV, Boston.  Oh, no.  Now, this is News Center.  Oh, no. 
[00:23:00]  Coverage you can count on.  I'm a lot of news.  Still to come, a winning prize or a losing lemon.  Susan Warren expired.  Beware reporters next.  Tina Tucker was thrilled with you on Radio Punt.  Pause that.  The tease is great because they show the hood up, the trunk up.  The trunk lights up.  The doors are open.  It looks like an abandoned car, which is pretty much what it was.  But that's the news fucking, you know, doing what they do, making the story even more sensational.  Oh, I remember wincing when I heard that music because I just knew we were going to get crucified on this one. 
[00:23:30]  Why do they always blame us?  Ah, because we were the faces to the contest.  But we had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  We really, you know, the station was doing the contest and decided, you know, it would be good to give it away on our day part.  Get their boys out there, right?  They're called day parts.  Yeah.  Back that up slightly there, Sam.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Remember this bitch?  Yeah.  Buyer beware.  We're part of some scam. 
[00:24:00]  Tina Tucker was thrilled when she won a radio contest for a classic car.  Radio station WAAF handed her the keys to a vintage Mustang.  But when she took a closer look, she noted her prize belonged in the junk heap and not her driveway.  So who's responsible here?  Susan Warnick with tonight's Buyer Beware.  Buyer beware.  Tina Tucker couldn't believe her luck last February when she held the winning key in 
[00:24:30]  WAAF's Sam Adams White Ale Mustang.  Of course, Sam Adams.  Thank you.  Sam Adams again.  Boy, of course he's never talking to us again.  Boy, have we fucked over Jim Cook over the years?  So he got fucked with this contest and still came back for the big one.  Hey, I hear you guys are giving away a toy Yoda.  Yeah, it's a toy Yoda.  Get it?  Oh, my God.  Fuck you assholes.  This story. 
[00:25:00]  Well, Kevin from Con has it.  Kevin from C-O-N-N if you want to go there now.  And I'll retweet this as well.  Wow.  But they have a picture of me and you in just horrible leather jackets.  We look so sleazy.  It just helps the story.  It really does.  I thought I looked cool in this dumb, long, black leather jacket.  You look terrible.  Just shills for the man.  We look so just slimy.  Adam's White Ale Mustang Contest.  They gave me a key along with nine other people and we all had a chance to try it. 
[00:25:30]  Mine started it.  Tina won a 1967 white Mustang.  I know it wasn't going to be like a 1998 Mustang, but I never expected it to be in this shape.  Tina's prize had body rot, a bad paint job, ripped seats, and broken equipment.  And it wouldn't start.  It's a piece of junk.  They just showed the trunk.  And the radio station was so lazy. 
[00:26:00]  They didn't even empty out the trunk.  There was garbage in the trunk.  There was rust.  And then the woman's shaking.  That shaking sound you heard, the rattling, was her grabbing onto the front bumper and just shaking it.  And it's going, clank, clank, clank.  This sucked.  We even knew before this woman even won and before anyone said a word, we went to Dave, remember, and said,  this is a piece of shit.  We're giving away a piece of shit and we've got to make it sound good.  And we've been bitching about managers and program directors ever since. 
[00:26:30]  Fast forward to today.  We're not going to the Super Bowl.  They're all just a bunch of idiots in the end.  I love this clue.  I do too.  I forgot all about this.  It's bringing me right back.  She's so pissed off.  It's a piece of junk.  Yes, it is.  Congrats.  And once again, they show a picture of the Mustang and everything is open.  Yeah, yeah.  The hood, the trunk, all the doors.  It's better to show the garbage.  All right.  All right.  It really is. 
[00:27:00]  It's embarrassing.  Very embarrassing.  Tina had the car towed to a repair shop where it's been virtually untouched since March because,  Tina says, she couldn't get WAAF to fix it.  No, they have not been cooperative until this past weekend when you got in touch with them.  They had no part of me.  My stepfather got in contact with them.  They were very rude to my father.  And they have had nothing to do with me.  They've washed the hands of me in this car for the past five months.  We're very much a big fan of Tina here. 
[00:27:30]  Ah, pause.  Ah, Dave Douglas.  Oh, I can't wait to.  Oh, is he going to try to smooth it out?  I can't wait to retweet this.  This is great.  You probably get to see stupid Dave Douglas with his 70s porn mustache.  Oh, my God.  Did he?  He looked more like a retard than I remember.  Yeah, I haven't.  Wow.  I haven't seen a picture of him in years, man.  Dave Douglas trying to, what is he, going to try to finagle his way out of this one?  OP Radio on Twitter.  I'll fucking retweet the Kevin from Connecticut thing.  What a great classic clip this is. 
[00:28:00]  Where is, uh, okay.  All right, go back.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I love this.  Go back.  Let's listen intently.  Look at his stupid haircut.  He is an idiot.  He cut his bangs all the way across way too short.  He's got retard bangs.  It's...  Wow.  To do with me, they've washed the hands of me and this car for the past five months.  We're very much a victim, as is Tina here.  While they admit giving Tina a seriously damaged car, WAAF management says it's not their fault.  They blame the people from whom they got the car. 
[00:28:30]  We trusted this organization to deliver the vehicle in good working order, and they didn't do that.  That's completely false.  Rich Marco runs...  Now that we don't have anything to do with this idiot...  First of all, he's wearing a tie for the day, because he finally gets on TV.  He always wanted to be on TV.  Secondly, why wouldn't you check the car before they deliver it?  Exactly.  Why are you assuming they're just going to deliver a nice car for you?  And when it's a piece of shit, and you see it's a piece of shit, why are you then passing it on to someone else? 
[00:29:00]  He's like a rapist going, hey, I'm as much of a victim here as this young lady that I raped.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  What an idiot.  I love this shit.  All right, let's hear a little more.  National Veterans Scholarship Fund.  They resell donated cars for scholarship money, and agreed to give WAAF the Mustang in exchange for free advertising.  But Marco insists the car was given as is.  It's basically, here's your car, and that's it. 
[00:29:30]  Now that the promo's over, they're coming back to me.  In fact, WAAF has contacted the Attorney General's office asking for an investigation of the National Veterans Scholarship Fund.  But they didn't do it until the very day we called asking about Tina's car.  And the scholarship fund is in good standing with the Department of Public Charities.  Rich Marco says he's happy to talk to any investigator.  Here we are trying to do something good. 
[00:30:00]  I haven't heard from WAAF in months.  And now, instead of calling me, they're calling the Attorney General.  You know, that's fine.  I mean, we've done nothing wrong.  This afternoon, WAAF assumed full responsibility for the Mustang, promising to pay for its full refurbishing and delivery to Tina within a month.  And even though they weren't directly involved in the car deal, Sam Adams' beer has vowed to make good if WAAF doesn't.  I'm Susan Warnick.  Jim Cook always mopping up our problems. 
[00:30:30]  He's like the wolf.  God, I miss that guy.  He fucking loved us.  I would love to know what happened to Tina.  All right, let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet, gentlemen.  He was mortified.  He's basically sitting there going, holy shit, will you give this lady the money?  What are you doing?  You like Oak Opie.  I want to know what happened to Tina, Dave Douglas, and the fucking Mustang.  How do we get that done? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  How do we get that done?  Wow, man.  What memories.  Kevin, what a great find.  That's fantastic.  I'm retweeting your link as we speak, but this is a must-see.  I guess they didn't blame us too much.  They just showed us a lot in that piece.  So pretty please with sugar on it.  Fix the fucking Mustang.  He's sitting there like, what the fuck's wrong with you guys?  He's got to be the wolf.  He's like, look, it's a lousy $10,000 probably. 
[00:31:30]  If you went to the lady and said, all right, here, can we give you $10,000 and call it even?  Give her the cash.  She would have said, fuck, yeah.  Absolutely.  She would have said, yes, thank you very much.  Yeah.  And a typical radio station, just like fucking hiding and hoping the phone doesn't ring.  Yeah.  Hoping there's no TV cameras outside.  It sat in a lot for five months after we gave it away.  Sat in a lot, rotting away more.  Just rotting more.  That is a classic, classic and typical radio fucking promotion fuck-up. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Oh, that is so funny.  And it's been going on ever since.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And before that.  Radio's the scum of entertainment.  It really is.  We've always known it.  It's one step off of the carny boardwalk.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, man.  That was funny.  God damn it.  I forgot about that.  Holy shit.  It's a piece of junk.  Yeah.  She was like, it's a piece of junk.  Dave Douglas with a fucking tie on. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, choke him with it.  Oh.  All right.  Let me fucking tweet this shit.  Yeah.  You got to get that out there.  People will love seeing Dave Dickless.  Oh, God.  Ooh.  Just now.  Wow.  What the hell is that?  It's way of putting a face to the Dave Dickless.  Huh?  It's way of putting a face to Dave Dickless after all these years.  It is.  You got a lot of our old stuff, don't you, Kev?  A lot of it's out there.  I don't have it, per se.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I forgot all about the Mustang.  I don't even know how it came up.  We were just talking about shit.  You got any other ones that we might have forgot about?  We were always on.  Two hours of audio.  Jesus.  You know, I don't know if we've played in a while, but the wow one is classic, too.  Yeah, the wow news story.  With the fucking, um, with the news guy who had earrings in his ears.  He was trying to, like, lull us into a false sense of security.  Oh, he was laughing and loving the whole promotion.  We had naked girls in that day, and he was very close to some activities. 
[00:33:30]  And then we're all excited, because he came in, uh, under the guise that he was doing  a positive piece on Whip Him Out Wednesday.  This is how stupid we were.  Just a fun little piece, yeah.  And, uh, and then we called everyone.  We're all excited.  Yeah, it's gonna be great.  And holy fuck, they crucified us on the news.  Of course they did.  He got his suit on.  He took his earring out and got all serious.  Right.  Like, the law should shut this down.  The danger to people on the highway. 
[00:34:00]  Like, what about the fun guy that came in and was laughing and squeezing tits and having  fun?  It's like, wait a minute.  We, we, we, we were giving you naked lap dances.  I mean, you're two hours ago.  Oh, sex, uh, sexy has an update.  Sexy.  Iraq has an update on what?  The Mustang?  Yeah.  Uh, on her, we found her number and I just gave her a call and I explained what we were  talking about.  She went no and hung up on me.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Holding a grudge like that? 
[00:34:30]  Why?  She, she's not answering now.  I don't know.  So, the contest...  As I asked her, I'm like, did you win this, uh, white Mustang from WAF?  14 years ago!  Yeah, and she said yes.  I said, well, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  We want to just touch base with you, see what happened to you and the Mustang.  And she went no and hung up.  And now she's not picking up.  Wow, that was...  Wow!  Wow, she's still pissed.  Hey, lighten up, Francis.  I forgot all about this.  Yeah.  She's still pissed.  That's 98.  That's 14 years ago.  Coming up on 14 years ago.  14 fucking years! 
[00:35:00]  Lighten up and come on the air with us.  Wow.  Yeah, because you know they refurbished the thing and it was still a piece of shit.  Tell her we'll make good.  Oh my God.  And we're going to give her...  How much should we give her?  We should give her a toy Yoda.  You're undergrind.  Over a hundred grand.  A hundred grand.  All right, Kev.  Thank you.  I'll look for that wild story.  Huh?  I'll look for that wild story.  Oh.  I don't know.  Have we played in a while?  I don't want to keep doing the same shit over and over again. 
[00:35:30]  But if we haven't played in a while, it might be worth it.  That isn't it.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thanks, Kevin.  All right.  Thank you.  Fuck, that's great.  That's a good one.  Wow.  The girl wouldn't fucking come on.  No.  She's pissed.  What is she, fucking 45 now?  She looked like she was...  Looked like she was...  Mid-20s, maybe.  Mid-20s.  Yeah, she's over 40 now.  Yeah.  Still holding a grudge.  Holds that grudge, man.  Wow.  What's that about? 
[00:36:00]  I'd love to know what happened with that.  How did it end?  We have it right there and she won't say, huh?  That sucks.  You know how it ended.  They kind of patched it up and said, look, we met our obligation and now here's your piece  of shit Mustang.  Enjoy.  Dumb radio promotions.  Oh, that's how that started.  Yeah.  We've done a few.  Oh, my God.  I had a weird fucking cosmic ghostly moment with my phone last night. 
[00:36:30]  What?  Oh, it was creepy.  What happened?  I was trying to tweet or something, you know, and then I'm constantly hitting the button  that brings up Siri and, you know, voice activated thing.  And it goes, who would you like to call?  And I went, no one.  And it said, calling Patrice O'Neill.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, ah!  Well, you should have fucking called.  Maybe he would have fucking, maybe he figured out some shit.  No, I hit the button.  Listen, it heard the O in no one. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  And the closest thing on my list must have been O'Neill.  So it said, calling Patrice O'Neill.  I was like, ah!  But if someone's going to figure out the afterlife, it would be Patrice.  Maybe figure some shit out.  It's like, nigga, I tried to call you.  You fucking hung up on my shit.  But you scared of ghosts?  Scared of ghosts, you little faggot?  What the fuck are you?  What time is that at?  So one chance I get, it's like I'm in jail or some shit, and I get one phone call, I call  your dumb ass.  What time is it at?  I don't know, 8-ish, 8.30-ish. 
[00:37:30]  That's creepy.  Oh, that would fucking...  Did the hair, like, stand up as they say?  Yeah.  No, I just kind of went like, ah!  Yeah.  And I hung up.  I hung up on Patrice Ghost calling me.  That's not good.  It was kind of creepy.  I wouldn't mind Patrice Ghost, though.  That'd be fun.  Oh, yeah.  Some ghosts I don't want.  You know, you don't want creepy ghosts.  Patrice Ghost would be fun, like, sarcastic ghosts.  He would make it fun.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Boo!  Boo! 
[00:38:00]  Ooh!  Boo!  And shit, and...  Mmm.  Wow, she wouldn't talk to us, huh, Yorick?  I'm bummed about that.  She wouldn't pick up when I called back.  Why?  She probably has a lot to say.  Yeah.  14 years, lady!  Come on, dummy!  What's wrong with you?  She probably couldn't get rid of the car.  It wasn't that big an issue in her life.  I mean, at the time, it sucked, and, you know...  It's probably a big flower pot now in our yard.  Bumming.  She probably was never able to get rid of it. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe she fucking, like, tried to get it fixed, and she gave it to a younger brother, and the brakes gave out, and he fucking winged across an intersection, got slammed by a cement truck, and died.  Oh, boy.  And that's why she didn't want to talk about it?  Yeah.  Could happen.  It could happen.  Yeah.  Speaking of the Super Bowl, I guess we should do this...  Well, we were a little earlier.  Yeah, at some point.  Going back to that.  You hear about the guy with the tickets?  Oh, yeah.  And the chick, his nice chick. 
[00:39:00]  This is unbelievable.  Let's listen to this.  Jason Aaliyah is giving away his tickets to the Super Bowl to the person who gets him the most Twitter followers.  Aaliyah, a television writer living in Nashville...  That's kind of nice.  That sounds nice.  Not a bad idea.  That's good.  Right?  Are they real tickets?  Build up your followers and stuff?  Or is he going to screw over the winner?  ...spent $8,000 on two tickets to the Super Bowl to go with his football-loving girlfriend.  Well, after he bought the tickets, things started to unravel. 
[00:39:30]  On November 7th, Jason was diagnosed with bladder cancer.  His girlfriend's response?  She dumped him.  In an interview with Trending Now, Jason told us she, quote,  could not handle the stress of having a boyfriend with cancer.  Jason was planning on proposing to her on Christmas.  Well, how long were they going out?  How long were they going out?  How long?  Huh?  He's planning on proposing to her in a year?  What happened?  Huh?  He just said Jason was planning on proposing to her on Christmas. 
[00:40:00]  Well, he's never, you know...  Yeah, come on.  He's amping it up now to really get your emotions going.  Yeah.  And did the relationship have problems before this?  I need more info.  This sounds horrible, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on.  More info.  Jason was planning on proposing to her on Christmas.  In an even crueler twist, his girlfriend still wanted the tickets.  Well, not only did Jason not give her the tickets, he held a contest to get rid of them  using the hashtag, win my ex's Super Bowl tickets. 
[00:40:30]  He has gained more than 2,500 followers so far and will announce the winner on Tuesday.  But Jason stresses that it is not about revenge.  He says he wants to give someone the same enjoyment that he thought he was going to get  with someone he loved.  Well, that sucks.  Boy, that sucks, huh?  I hear a lot of people, like, you know, can't handle the stress. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  That 50-50 movie deals with that a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, I get depressed.  I wouldn't see that.  Huh?  I don't want to see that.  50-50?  Yeah, I don't want to see that.  I think you would like it.  Nah, probably.  It's well written.  Nah, I don't think I'd say that.  Nah.  Nah, I don't think I'd say that.  Too ghoulish?  Yeah.  Ghoulish.  I don't like ghoulish.  I don't want to see that incredibly close and fucking loud movie either.  Whatever that is.  What's that?  With that kid and the fucking father's dead in the trade center and fucking...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Why?  Why did they have to make it the trade center to really make it hurt?  Exactly.  Because people...  That one makes a lot of people hurt a lot.  Now you could have...  Why couldn't Tom...  Maybe we need to see the movie, but why did Tom Hanks have to die in that way?  And then there had to be a special key he left behind.  Oh, exactly.  And now the kid has to figure out what the key is for.  Could have been in a horrible combine accident on a farm.  Something else.  Something like that.  Could have been burned to death in a metal forge.  Right.  Something like that.  Right.  And stuck in the gears of a hopper at a bakery. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Yeah.  But they went with the Twin Towers thing.  I went with that.  So...  You're right.  I have no desire to see that.  Car falling on him when he's on a crawler underneath a vehicle changing an exhaust pipe.  We're working on the Mustang.  Yeah, that shitty Mustang.  To get it together for Tina.  Anything.  Anything else but the Twin Towers.  Oh, the Twin Towers.  Leave it alone.  They're building that building pretty good now.  It's just about done.  That thing's pretty goddamn tall now. 
[00:42:30]  I don't think it's going any higher, is it?  Well, they're going to put that big spire on top.  To kind of cheat and get more height out of it.  I don't like when buildings cheat.  I don't like the cheating building either.  I want floors all the way up to the ceiling.  I think the world record should be how many floors you got, not the cheating part.  Yeah.  Because anyone could put a stick up there.  Were they going to duct tape a broom handle if they're a little short?  Including the Empire State Building, which is old school.  But you can't have all that cheating stuff.  Empire State Building's kind of cool with the big antenna. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  But it's cheating.  I don't think it was meant...  They didn't say, let's put an antenna on there to get this building higher.  Right.  They put an antenna on it because it's the highest building around.  And they were like, hey, we need to get our radio signals out.  Right.  But this, on purpose, they're putting a spire on it just to make it...  Is it going to be a...  A 1776-foot-high building that they want it to be.  Is it going to be an antenna?  Probably.  I would assume there'll be an antennae on there.  Is it going to be kind of impressive, or is it just going to be... 
[00:43:30]  Well, it looks impressive now.  It's already higher than any of the buildings around it.  No, I mean, is the spire or whatever?  The spire going to be impressive?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's sort of a sail-looking kind of a shape to it.  It's more of a triangle than just a stick.  I don't know.  And then that building next to it's going to look pretty cool, too.  Looks like it was cut with a lightsaber on a bias.  Right.  Yeah.  If I may geek it up here.  If I may geek it up a little bit. 
[00:44:00]  Hmm.  When is that thing going to be done?  I don't know.  I think in the spring.  Oh.  I think that cancer story just creeped us out.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah.  Gives you the heebie-jeebies.  Gives me the heebie-jeebies.  You know what movie I want to see?  What do you want to see?  Where they try to save the whales.  Oh, Jesus.  Where they got to fucking dig holes in the ice every fucking ten feet. 
[00:44:30]  It's based on a true story.  So what was the true story?  The whole town got together and saved the whales.  Some seal fucking couldn't find its way.  They made it three whales.  I don't know.  I liked it better when it was called fucking The Voyage Home.  What is it called?  Big Miracle?  Oh, yeah.  With Drew Barrymore.  Yep.  Yeah.  I want to see this movie.  No, you don't.  It's heartwarming, Ant.  I need some heartwarming in my life.  When can I see this?  This weekend?  You know what heartwarming means?  It means you have blockage. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you, Col.  What the hell?  Oh, it's a commercial.  Oh.  No, we always get these ads coming in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Little ads.  Yeah.  Okay, the ad's almost done.  There it is.  This looks great.  It's PG.  It's fun for just about everybody.  The Avocado.  This little guy and pretty much everything else in town has to take four separate plane rides 
[00:45:30]  to arrive up here in Chile, Barrow, Alaska.  Is he the weatherman?  Adam.  Your material up there seems like it's running a little thin.  What the heck?  I think Barrow might have one great story left in her.  This is solid ice.  It goes for five miles from here to the open ocean.  Three gray whales are now trapped in walls of ice six inches thick.  You have whales in trouble and you didn't call me?  I didn't call you because there's nothing you can do.  There's always something you can do.  That's Drew Barrymore playing that role she plays. 
[00:46:00]  Are you trying to say that she doesn't really adjust?  What a fucking one-dimensional actress this Drew Barrymore is.  She's kind of like America's Sweetheart.  Oh, is she?  With that heart.  Heart of gold.  Yeah.  Kind of hippie-ish with that heart of gold.  You know what?  She plays that well.  Ah.  It's all downhill after E.T.  That's great.  Do we have to play the whole thing?  She's going to save the whales.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Get the town together.  It gets very emotional.  Oh, is that how it gets very emotional?  You know, they have to literally chop holes in the ice so they could breathe as they move  along under the ice.  Right.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, because they breathe.  They're mammals, you know.  And then, meh, they can't swim five miles without breathing.  Right.  So they have to chip these holes in the ice.  What's that?  And then as the whales get to the hole, they come up, they breathe, and then they go to  the next hole.  Right.  You think there's going to be a problem?  I bet there's a problem.  Even though they figured out how to get the whales? 
[00:47:00]  I bet at one point.  You think one's going to wander away for a while?  One wanders away.  And they're going to be like, oh no, where's the one whale?  Or they have a freeze.  Right.  Or they have to chop a hole.  They're like, oh no, quick, quick, get the hole chopped.  The whale moved.  And then they find the whale maybe at the last minute, and it breathes just in time.  Yes.  It comes up.  And then you can finally get the grand finale.  And the music plays, and everyone goes, oh!  And then the final cutting of the ice as they go into the ocean.  Into the ocean.  The last one.  Just in time to have some Japanese ship harpoon them. 
[00:47:30]  That would be good.  For their nostrils, because it makes them have boners.  And then, yeah, a Klingon ship that Kirk is in, controlling, gets in the way of the harpoon  at the last minute.  I bet the last hole, right, they breathe, and then they go down.  Right.  And it's an inordinate, a very long time.  Right.  And they're waiting, waiting.  And then, just when you think they're dead, they come out in the ocean.  And everyone's like, oh! 
[00:48:00]  And the music plays.  Oh, there they are!  Oh, wow!  There they are!  Yeah!  Woo!  And there's hugging, and yeah!  Go, you go!  And now they're breaching.  Yeah.  The whales are doing the breaching thing.  They're doing their little dance.  They're doing their little dance.  They're splashing around.  Oh, yay!  It is fucking fantastic!  A lot of hugging.  Oh, lots of hugging.  Drew Barrymore's crying, but their tears are joy.  Oh, look, a friend!  Oh, it's hilarious!  Oh, they're breaching whales! 
[00:48:30]  Oh, the sun's going to be just right in the sky.  Oh, and then Drew Barrymore's there.  And someone cracks her over the head with a club, like a baby seal.  Hey, Drew!  Not for you.  Oh, some of the friends are there.  Wait a minute.  You think it's going to be one of those movies where everyone claps in the theater?  Yes!  I haven't been to one of those in a while.  Yay!  Yay!  And then as you're walking out in silence with your head down, people are going, that  was really good. 
[00:49:00]  They talk about the movie on the way out.  That was really good.  I liked the part when, shut up!  Save it for your awful, boring car ride home that I hope ends in flames.  It started with me saying you think we hate everything.  Oh, right.  It's a feel-good movie.  Apparently, yes.  Is it a feel-good movie?  Sure, sure.  Oh, God, I bet, also, I bet, I bet, some love happens between the guy from The Office  and the one-dimensional actress. 
[00:49:30]  The love story, you've got to have that.  Yeah.  Intertwined.  Yeah.  Do you think she'll be more First 50 Dates-ish or more Fever Pitch?  I'm feeling Fever Pitch.  Oh, you've got to go Fever Pitch on this one.  I think Fever Pitch.  How about Home Fries-ish?  A little Home Fries-ish.  You've seen a lot of Drew Barrymore movies.  Oh, have I ever.  I don't know, Home Fries.  Oh, is she more, I don't know.  She's going to play that sweet girl. 
[00:50:00]  I told you, hippie with a big heart and a pure soul.  There'll be a misunderstanding, but it'll all get played out in the end.  They'll see it her way in the end.  Yeah, she's not going to be the Charlie's Angels, Drew Barrymore.  No way.  Uh-uh.  Boy, was that a bust.  No, yeah, yeah.  Maybe you should have picked the hotter chicks.  Drew Barrymore didn't fit in that lineup.  I used to be a big fan of Drew Barrymore.  She produced it or something. 
[00:50:30]  So she had to put herself in it?  And she also said she didn't like guns in it or something.  All right.  So you make Charlie's Angels without guns.  Yeah.  Why don't you just stay away from those projects?  Let someone else do it.  Yeah, you don't like it.  Don't do it.  I believe the original Charlie's Angels were pulling out pieces all the time, right?  Exactly.  Why wouldn't they?  Freeze, slime ball.  And then you turn around and you're getting fucking arrested by some big-titted blonde bombshell animal.  You don't know what fucking bureau she's from.  She doesn't show a badge. 
[00:51:00]  She's driving a shitty 1970s version of the Mustang, which stunk.  The Mustang 2.  They all had Mustang 2s.  E-Rock, please don't kill the messenger.  But a lot of people are asking, how did it feel when you were finally free?  Oh.  Oh, they're implying E-Rock is one of the whales in the movie.  He's not even that fat.  No.  Not that fat.  Well. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  Why do they do it to you?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Eat-a-pot-am.  Yep.  You want to eat?  I want to eat.  I think we did good there.  I think so, too.  Never fear, either.  From what I hear, Mr. Jim Norton will be here today.  Oh, yeah.  His flight was delayed, as they say.  Delayed.  You should be here any moment.  Probably by the time we get back.  And when we get back, I want to visit something that I discovered yesterday. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, a little taste right here.  Just a little taste.  I want to talk about this.  Bicuriousness?  Yes, sure.  A little bicuriousness.  Taking a few peeks here and there.  Ah.  Yeah, we got to talk about this after the break.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor call and say.  Oh, is that classic?  This had me howling. 
[00:52:30]  That's a good one.  And we'll explain next.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  107th caller.  107th caller.  No, no way.  Tell me, I won.  I won.  I don't know why.  You're kidding, right?  107.  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot, jeez, I've got to calm down. 
[00:53:00]  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand, bro?  I got this, oh, man, I got this shit box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one, a new truck.  Oh, that, oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, what the f*** you been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of douchebags.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  He was pissed.  You're serious.  XM.  XM.  This is the O'Brien Anthony Show.  Fly me to the moon. 
[00:54:00]  Let me play among the stars.  Let me see what spring is like on a Jupiter.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I know what this is.  This is terrible.  I love that it's all about Ann.  They expect me to yell and scream.  When Ann yells and scream, it makes it have more of a punch.  This is kind of a...  Well, let me make it official, Ann.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Yeah, hello.  Hi.  How was it working with Drew Barrymore, by the way?  Did you enjoy your time?  Oh, you're insinuating he was one of the whales.  Because he never commented about the thing we said before the break.  Yeah.  What do you got here?  I don't know why they say those things about you.  Quote, unquote.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now, E-Rock.  I hate that people are onto my game. 
[00:55:00]  I would fucking hate it.  E-Rock knows there wasn't one person saying shit.  Ah.  That's what he just made sure everyone knew.  Sorry, Ann.  Go ahead.  I would assume...  I would assume this is Apollo 14 blasted off on a mission to the moon 41 years ago.  Well, when you have this sheet in front of you, yes, it's easy.  Yeah, but first of all, Apollo 14, you know, all the Apollo missions, believe me, technical marvels. 
[00:55:30]  But when it's the first one, or the final one, or even Apollo 13, which didn't quite pull it off, I could understand that.  But 14?  What's wrong with 14?  Eh, no one's really, eh.  No one really thinks about 14.  What happened with 14?  It went to the moon, came back, came back.  Can you name one astronaut?  Eh, nope.  Not from 14.  I can.  Who?  I'm not going to say. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Why do I have to share that info with people?  They can look it up themselves.  Yeah.  No, Gus Grissom wasn't there.  Gus Grissom.  Gus Grissom was dead by then.  Good old Gus Grissom.  How many astronauts could you name?  Um, let me think.  Like moon astronauts.  Moon astronauts, not the original Mercury 7?  Ah.  Moon astronauts.  Fair enough.  Astronauts in general.  Oh.  I know Neil Armstrong. 
[00:56:30]  Buzz Aldrin.  And I know Buzz Aldrin.  Um, Mike Collins.  I know Mike Collins.  Um, uh, Ted Sheckler?  No.  No, no.  Ted Lee.  No.  Um, I know.  I think my brother was supposed to be named after an astronaut.  Is there an astronaut with Scott?  Yeah, yeah.  Was there?  Yeah.  He likes to tell people he was named after an astronaut.  But.  Really?  Most of us were named after sitcom characters.  But I think he likes to romanticize his name. 
[00:57:00]  John Glenn.  John Glenn?  Yeah.  Is Scott an astronaut?  No.  Scott Carpenter?  Scott Carpenter.  Yeah.  My brother likes to think.  Scott.  Huh?  David Scott.  Well, Scott Carpenter's the famous one.  He was one of the original.  Yeah, I think my brother likes to think he was named after him.  Yeah.  He might have been.  My brother Darren, absolutely after Darren Stevens.  Darren Stevens.  Yes.  Named after Darren Stevens.  But I'm not Greg from Greg Brady.  No.  No.  What Greg are you?  I don't know. 
[00:57:30]  My mom's best friend's husband was named Greg, so that was a little weird.  I'm wondering who my real father is.  Oh, boy.  Why would I be named after some other guy's fucking...  Yeah, boy.  Why?  She goes, I just like the name.  I wonder if there's something there.  Oh, man.  Do I have Greek tendencies?  Greek.  I don't know.  Ask somebody else.  I believe he was Greek.  Greek.  Hey, Greek.  Do I look Greek?  Even with the beard, maybe?  Yeah, with the beard.  Maybe I look a little Greek. 
[00:58:00]  You're not swarthy enough.  No.  You're not dark and olive oily enough.  Yeah.  To be the Greek.  We're waiting for Jim Norton, because Kenny gave us a great tease.  He just said that Jimmy lives a what life?  Exciting.  Exciting life.  Exciting life, he said.  Jimmy was supposed to be here already.  Obviously, there was a problem.  Yeah.  And Kenny, we forced him.  He told us what the problem is, but I guess we should...  We'll wait for Jimmy.  We should let Jimmy tell the audience what the problem was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sounded harrowing. 
[00:58:30]  It really did.  Why?  It just...  Because right when Kenny said it, I just went, oh, fuck.  This better have ended well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of the worst things that could happen to you.  I think it's one of the worst things that could happen to you.  Besides, you know, getting injured or dying.  Besides the real shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, let's not...  You know, let's blow off the cancer shit and all that.  Right.  But basic stuff that could happen to you.  This is probably right up there. 
[00:59:00]  Could be number one.  Yeah.  This is a bad one.  Anybody.  Don't you think?  Anybody would freak out.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Anybody would freak out.  Besides health shit, this is something you just never want happening to you.  Yep.  Maybe we could do a little phone topic.  Oh.  Hey, what is it that you think?  Nobody would want to happen to them.  The number one thing.  By the way, let the record state, just an update.  A couple things. 
[00:59:30]  Joe DeRosa did not do 20 legal push-ups.  Oh, boy.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is I, in the end, don't give a fuck.  It was a dumb, silly radio bit.  Sure.  Sure.  And thirdly, because people don't listen to the whole show, I gave Joe DeRosa his money,  so fucking relax.  Oh, boy.  But it looks like people are split on whether he did the legal push-ups or not.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There's no clear winner here.  There really isn't.  No.  A lot of people are pointing fingers at Mars. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  For not judging the contest properly.  That's what I said right off the bat.  I had no qualms with Joe DeRosa doing the push-ups that he was doing.  Right.  He wasn't being called out on him, so why wouldn't he?  Right.  It's like, hey, I'm going to make some money, and I can get through these push-ups.  Have you released your official statement on this?  You don't think he did them either, right?  No.  I don't think he did the push-ups properly, but...  As far as the bets was set up, I lose.  And yeah, because Mars is the guy. 
[01:00:30]  His word was final.  Yeah.  So, I mean, most of these are not 90 degrees.  I didn't even know that all he had to do was 90 degrees.  I always was taught you've got to hit that fucking floor.  Yeah, yeah.  And a lot of people are saying that...  You should go down further than 90 degrees, but...  Yeah.  I mean, just at least...  Oh, do we have a Jim Norton?  Start an update.  Oh.  Kenny's in the...  Yes, Kenny.  ...studio.  Yes, he just entered the borough of Manhattan.  Holy...  Ah.  All righty. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, he's over the bridge, that means, right?  The Bridger Tunnel.  Bridger Tunnel?  All right.  I'm not sure what she took because of traffic.  Maybe we'll get some breaks in today, so we'll talk a little more.  We'll take a break, and then we'll see what happened to Jim Norton,  because he lives an exciting life, you're saying.  Yes, and I do concur with you, GH, about the push-ups.  The video speaks for itself.  If the rule was his arm had to bend 90 degrees, he clearly...  Did not.  Correct.  Yeah, but there's enough people saying he did, so I want to acknowledge those people 
[01:01:30]  as well.  But it's not...  I don't know what the percentage is, but it's...  I think more people are saying he did not do them properly.  Look, see, his head down is deceiving.  Right.  There's a lot of space there.  Other people say Mars should have put his fist down,  and I guess a lot of military guys, they have to hit the fist.  Really?  With their chest.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  So then there's no doubt that you went 90 degrees or a little more.  Yeah.  So, whatever. 
[01:02:00]  It was a dumb, stupid fucking radio bit that people get very excited over.  Yeah.  Let's have a full range of motion.  Huh?  Full range of motion.  Right.  Yeah.  Mars goes, are you mad at me?  When I walked in this morning, I'm like, no.  We're always mad at you.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  No, I'm not mad at you.  It's just another log of anger to throw on the fire.  I go, I don't think he did the push-ups legally, but I lost a bet fair and square.  Yeah.  Because I picked you, dummy.  You want to do the song thing I teased before the break? 
[01:02:30]  I certainly do.  I think most people will know right away.  We'll figure this out?  Yeah, I was hoping not.  I was hoping to keep it more of a mystery, but it doesn't matter in the end.  I think it is pretty obvious.  You think?  Well, now to me it is.  I was hoping to get cut out the fat, and then you wouldn't know, I don't think.  Whatever.  I teased this before the break.  Listen to this.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor call and say...  Hold on. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Okay.  It's good.  It's really good.  Wait, hold on.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in...  Quit making me laugh.  I'm not.  I'm just looking over here because I just want to hear it perfectly with this ear.  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor call and saying something about a queen.  There were peasants singing and drummers drumming and the archers split the tree. 
[01:03:30]  All in a dream.  I almost split his head.  Why are you laughing?  That's good.  Don't I sound like Neil Young?  You should do one of the...  You should do a Neil Young cover on my album.  All in a dream.  He doesn't stop.  In a dream, the loading had begun. 
[01:04:00]  Flying Mother Nature silver seas to a new home in the sun.  I can't believe you know the words.  Flying Mother Nature silver seas to a new home in the sun.  I was lying in a burnout basement with a full moon in my eyes. 
[01:04:30]  I was hoping for a replacement.  Then the sun burst through the sky all in a dream.  I didn't know all the words.  He's retarded.  I get what you did in the whole song.  Huh?  See?  That's pretty good shit right there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  People love it.  All in a dream.  That's some Neil Young right there.  Huh?  That was off the hook.  Why don't we go on tour singing together? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, well, screw stand-up, right?  We could sing.  He's an idiot savant because he doesn't know anything.  No.  I mean, he knows stuff, but he doesn't...  No.  He forgets things all the time, but he knows every word of that song?  That's weird.  Because Bonnie even goes, how do you know the words?  Because I was assuming maybe he had them in front of him.  No, he just...  But she wouldn't have said that.  He knows the words.  Right.  So that's obviously Rich Voss.  Yeah.  And it's on their latest podcast that I think was available starting yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  I'm telling you, everyone's doing a podcast at this point.  I mean, everyone.  I listen to Voss and Bonnie.  I listen to a little of the Ant one.  Mm-hmm.  Haven't listened to Sam's yet.  That's great.  And a little bit of the Bob Kelly one, because I do that one from time to time.  That's it.  Yeah.  But everyone's doing podcasts now.  Of course.  It's a thing to do.  I fucking love theirs, because they're just so real.  Yeah.  It's just them hanging out and bashing each other, and Rich apparently singing poorly. 
[01:06:00]  Well, he does Under the Boardwalk, too.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  You want to hear Under the Boardwalk?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of that.  I think he likes the songs with falsetto in them.  Does he?  Or is it falsetto?  Falsetto, yeah.  O or A?  O.  Falsetto.  Yeah.  I wish I knew another song.  I do.  You know what?  Let's not give it all away.  But let me do Under the Boardwalk.  No.  Let's not give it all away.  Under the boardwalk, down by the sea. 
[01:06:30]  I'll do that part.  You do the Under the Boardwalk part.  It's not Down by the Sea.  Under the boardwalk.  Down by the sea.  Under the boardwalk.  I don't know any of the words.  I don't know the words.  Hey, Raina.  Yes, Raina.  She wants to sing with us.  No.  To wrap it up.  I don't want to.  Come on.  What are we?  What?  I just hate the idea that we're, like, traveling circus clowns.  She doesn't want to be a circus family.  No.  The aristocrats. 
[01:07:00]  Identity theft, people are guessing, with the Jim Norton thing.  Oh.  No.  This is something that I think most people would just be in a major fucking panic if it happened to them.  But what it is could lead to identity theft, that's for sure.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's a good hint.  Yeah.  But, you're obsessed with that video there, Sam?  A hundred percent.  Why?  I could watch this video.  Like, this could be, if there was one video for me to watch always, this would be it.  The electric wheelchair homie singing karaoke?  Every part of it. 
[01:07:30]  Like, when you start breaking it down and analyzing what's going on on every level.  Right.  It just gets funnier and funnier.  There's just a guy.  You see the car almost take him out at the end?  That's part of it.  And the wheelchair doesn't give a fuck?  Wheelchair guy don't give a fuck.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  It's his road.  Right.  And all the cars will stop for him because he needs to share his karaoke with everyone.  Ah.  It's my brother-in-law, AJ, down there in Philly.  On the job, he rants this guy.  And I guess this guy is known all over Philly.  All he does is he just wanders around in his electric wheelchair. 
[01:08:00]  He's got a karaoke machine and he just sings songs.  That's great.  And he don't give a shit what people think of him.  That's great.  Is he any good?  Yeah.  Can he sing?  Yep.  Huh?  Rocks that mic?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  He just comes into the shot.  Out of the shot.  That's the white van at the end.  Or truck. 
[01:08:30]  He jumps on his brakes.  Yeah, he almost ran him over.  It sounds like Mickey McGee.  Whenever you call me, I'll be there.  But I guess he's a legend down there.  I did not know that.  He's the man.  He is the man.  Is he the mayor, though?  He should be.  I would vote for him.  Every city has one real mayor and one fake mayor.  And the people there, they go, oh, he's like the mayor of...  Yeah, he's the mayor.  And you've got to be a little wacky to be the mayor.  Speaking of mayors... 
[01:09:00]  God, we're just waiting for Jimmy.  Mayor!  I don't know what happened.  I like the sound.  Goldie Wilson ruining Hill Valley with his horrid fucking policies that turned a movie theater  into a porn theater and dirt all over the place.  Terrible.  The mayors are at it for their Super Bowl bet.  Oh, boy.  I can only imagine.  What are they betting?  You've got Mayor Bloomberg here in New York and Mayor Menino in Boston.  You do realize that Mustang was 14 years ago and he was the mayor of Boston. 
[01:09:30]  He was the mayor.  And he was the mayor way before that.  Before that.  He's got to be pushing 20 years as the mayor of a city.  Is that legal?  It shouldn't be.  With the Super Bowl less than a week away, Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Menino made their  bet.  And it's really stupid.  It's like a travel thing.  Trying to help each city's tourism, I guess.  If the Giants win a New York family, we'll win a super tour of Boston.  Whoa!  They get four tickets on JetBlue. 
[01:10:00]  Do they go on the duck boats?  Let's see.  A two-night stay at the Ritz-Carlton.  Dinner for four illegal seafoods.  Food's.  Hobicide.  Hobicide.  Hobicide.  Dinner for four at the Top of the Hub restaurant.  Oh, they get a couple dinners, huh?  Top of the Hub, Dinner of Legal Seafood and Homicide.  Oh, wait, no.  Hobicide.  Hobicide.  Four tickets to a performance at the City Performing Arts Center.  You get box seats to a Bruins or Celtics game. 
[01:10:30]  Wow, this is huge.  A behind-the-scenes tour of the newly expanded Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.  That sounds boring.  And there you go.  A duck tour ride, Ant.  Duck tours.  A VIP tour of the Personal Diaries of John Adams, which inspired the HBO series at the  Boston Public Library.  A VIP tour of the Samuel Adams Brewery.  All right.  In Jamaica Plains.  Jim Cook.  That's a scary ride into Jamaica Plains.  Oh, yeah.  Check out the brewery, by the way.  Especially on a duck.  But they got 20 fucking foot fences now. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  So you're good as soon as you get into the compound.  And a photo with Mayor Menino.  Oh, man.  Would I love that one.  And then you got, if the Patriots win, one Boston family will win a super tour of New York City.  They will receive four tickets on the Delta shuttle.  JetBlue better than Delta?  What's going on here?  Why would anybody fly?  It's Boston to New York.  You got to have the whole experience of landing at the big airport of each city.  Yeah.  And then Boston, clicker.  It goes on.  It's Grand Hyatt they stay at. 
[01:11:30]  Grand Hyatt?  They go to the Russian Tea Room.  Russian Tea Room?  They go to B. Smith's Restaurant.  There's a little drop-off with New York's part of this bet.  Why not the fucking Ritz-Carlton here?  Yeah.  Why don't you just fucking four club seats to a Rangers or Knicks game?  Four tickets to the Phantom of the Opera.  You got to take in a Broadway show.  You got to see a Broadway show.  It's a joyful, it's a joyful. 
[01:12:00]  A ride with the captain on statue cruises to Liberty and Ellis Island.  What?  When the VIP tour of the Statue of Liberty Crown and Museum.  Is that the captain that smashed into the pier that day?  That would be exciting.  That would be fun, right?  Make it exciting.  Excitement.  I think Boston has the better deal here.  A VIP tour of the New American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  A VIP tour of the Brooklyn Brewery.  And a photo with Mayor Bloomberg.  She's going to take a picture with you.  How do people enter this shit?  It's a lot.  How the fuck are they? 
[01:12:30]  More info about how to enter will be available from the losing city after the Super Bowl.  Oh, thanks.  So you got to enter after?  I guess, yeah.  Well.  I guess that's so they don't get a bunch of entrants from the team that lost.  True.  It cuts down your sorting factor.  Where's Jimmy?  Mimi.  He's on his way.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, he's on his way.  Are you a Jack White guy at White Stripes and all that?  Yeah, I like it. 
[01:13:00]  It was a big day.  I think yesterday or today, a solo record comes out.  Yeah.  Yesterday, it came out on radio yesterday and then iTunes today.  Really?  The first single, yeah.  Did anybody break into the boss's office to steal it?  No, but somehow XMU.  Maybe Rob Cross did.  They should have done that.  Break into the office, you steal it, and you videotape the whole thing.  Actually, I think Ron and Fez broke into Rob Cross's office.  Ah.  Grabbed the Jack White.  Yeah, to get the song on the air.  Oh, that's good.  Nice.  He lost his wallet.  People are trying to guess what happened to Jimmy. 
[01:13:30]  That is making him a little late today.  No.  He did not lose his wallet.  No.  Can we hear a little of the Jack White song?  Boy, I see some luggage.  Oh, wait.  Jimmy's here.  It's called Love Interruption.  Is Jimmy in the Batroom?  Love Interruption.  Jimmy in the Batroom?  Kenny's laughing.  Oh, no.  Here come the bags.  Kenny's laughing.  Why are you laughing, Kenny?  Everything okay?  Hope.  Is he fired up?  All's well that ends well.  Is he fired up?  All's well that ends well. 
[01:14:00]  You rarely laugh.  What's up?  Why are you laughing?  He's fired up, isn't he?  Oh, boy.  Well, we're not sure.  He'll probably be a smile on Kenny's face.  He's a professional, though.  He'll come in and he'll be fine.  Yeah.  He's probably holding his huge hog right now.  Right.  In front of the glory hole.  Emptying his bladder.  Yeah.  Or prostate.  I think the Jack White will have to wait because Jimmy's going to be coming to that door any second. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And with Kenny smiling, this is going to be good.  Well, like I said, he's professional.  Yeah.  And if anybody wants to see his bit from the tonight show, I put it on my Facebook page.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be starstruck.  Oh, man.  Hi, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Boy, it's been so long.  I know.  Been a while.  What a lovely trip.  Take a little seat.  What happened?  Because Kenny teased it. 
[01:15:00]  Coming in, we left a half hour late because that American Airlines flight's always early.  Right.  Yeah.  But there was a Delta flight stuck in the airport behind us.  We're just sitting there.  Which could I push?  I offered to.  I said, I'll just put my asshole against the end of the plane and back up.  But the pilot came on after like 20 minutes and he goes, this is a push-in gate, a tow-in gate.  So there was a Delta plane just stuck because one of his engines wasn't working.  Oh.  So we had to sit there like douchebags.  So we fly in.  We get in. 
[01:15:30]  We land a little after six, which is very late for this flight.  And I'm getting into the car.  I'm fucking getting in the car.  So you're out of the airport.  This is probably about a few minutes after six.  No, but I mean you're out of the airport, which is key to the story.  You're getting in a car?  Oh, yeah.  I'm the guy, the guy, Ruby.  Oh, my God.  I'm just slowing the story down.  Go ahead.  The guy, Ruby.  Yeah.  So he's putting my bag in the back.  Yeah.  And I look at my laptop bag and it just looks wrong.  Oh, no. 
[01:16:00]  And something looks wrong and I just go, oh, no.  So I open the place where my laptop is supposed to be.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  It was weird how you know your luggage so well that when he put it down, it looked like  an old man's mouth when his teeth are out.  Right.  Like that little sinking.  And I'm like, I left my fucking laptop on the plane.  Oh, man.  And that could be, we were talking about, that could be one of the worst things besides, you  know, a health thing that could happen to you.  Everything is on there. 
[01:16:30]  Of course.  Oh, my God.  So what did you do?  But you're out of the airport already.  But I was still in the airport, but I was out of the actual building.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  I was out of the terminal, but I was in the vicinity.  So he goes, you got to go back in.  So I run back in in a panic.  Oh, my God.  But I can't go back up.  So I talked to this lady and she goes, well, just go to the baggage people.  So I go into the office.  I'm standing like a douche.  There's nobody there.  There's like a camera.  So I figure they watch people walk in.  Were you waving at the camera?  Yes.  Like, help me. 
[01:17:00]  I was like, I'm here.  I'm here.  They're just watching it going, look at this idiot.  This asshole.  So I went out again.  I'm like, lady, there's no one in there.  And she points me to a younger gentleman who I say, look, I left my, I tell him the flight  number.  I don't remember the gate.  The gate's a fucking 10 minute walk.  I don't know why at JFK, American Airlines, you have to like walk under the runway back up  to the other side.  That's where my gate is.  So I have to stand there for 15 minutes.  I'm waiting for this guy. 
[01:17:30]  In a panic.  In an absolute panic.  And he comes back empty handed.  And he goes, they found it, but security has it.  So I was like, oh, they're going to go through it.  I was worried about that, just like on a plane.  But a couple of minutes later, security brought it in.  I said they'd give my license.  They had to fill out my info.  They probably looked at your computer and went, just give it back to them.  Give it back.  They couldn't wait to give it back to you.  Give it back.  This is way too filthy for us to deal with. 
[01:18:00]  So I was very happy that I got.  Thank God I fucking saw that.  Because if I was on my way in and saw that, because Kenny called and he said there's no  one answering at the gate, of course.  And then lost and found.  It was supposed to be there.  No one was there.  So he had to leave a message.  Oh, man.  That could have been bad.  Dude, that could have been bad.  I fucking lost my camera.  I was going to say, what's going on with you?  I don't know.  I might have Alzheimer's.  Camera in the cab and now a laptop on the plane.  Yeah.  All within a week?  How did you just leave it on the plane?  Where was it?  Well, I was under the seat in front of me. 
[01:18:30]  They give you a comforter and a fucking pillow on this flight.  Yeah.  And under the seat in front of me, there's like a little section to put your stuff.  It's not under the seat physically.  And I had the blanket.  I put the blanket back in over the laptop.  Oh, no.  And I never forget it.  I've never forgotten in my life.  Because it was an Asian guy, one seat over to my left, a real creep.  And he looked like a fat toad.  And I could smell his breath from where I was sitting.  It was flu breath.  Oh, no. 
[01:19:00]  Go sleeping with his tie still on.  Guy's probably worth 200 million.  Fucking hope he's dead.  Damn.  That could have been bad.  That could have been a disastrous trip.  Glad we got that back.  Yeah.  Wow.  Boy, do we have a lot of fans.  I couldn't believe how great the fucking Tempe Improv was amazing.  Kenny was saying.  75 to 80% of them hardcore fans.  I couldn't believe how many fans.  Because I've never done a gig out there.  Who knew that was tremendous.  How great is Arizona?  One of my favorite places on earth is Arizona.  Tempe Improv is beautiful.  Yeah.  Not many people know about this Arizona. 
[01:19:30]  I'm telling you.  They'd rather go out to California or go down to Texas.  It's better.  Whatever.  It's much better.  Arizona's amazing.  Oh, Arizona's better?  The weather.  It's hot.  But it's a nice hot.  It wasn't bad when I was there because it's winter.  But it was.  It's dry.  It's nice.  They've already stopped selling sweaters.  I was trying to buy another.  Because now I'm in my sweater phase.  I was trying to buy a sweater boy cutie.  Yeah, of course.  Sweet boy.  Sweet boy or sweater boy?  Sweater boy cutie.  Sweater boy cutie.  Right.  And Joe Perry was on Leno last night. 
[01:20:00]  He was one of the guests.  And I said hi to him.  But he had no remembrance of ever meeting me.  Oh, of course.  He doesn't remember doing the show or anything.  Was Madonna on?  Yes.  Did you meet her?  Did you meet the match?  No.  Why?  I just didn't.  Why?  You picked up your camera, though.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Why couldn't you meet Madonna?  She's too big.  Kind of, yeah.  That's a big one.  I know.  But you're on the show.  You're on the show.  It's not like audience.  Here's my picture of Madonna from the dressing room.  Let me see what you did.  He went in front of the television, the monitor that he watched in the dressing room, and took 
[01:20:30]  a picture of himself.  You tried, though, right?  Oh, God.  How close did...  That's amazing.  I didn't get...  Now, why?  I literally...  I can be very honest.  I didn't get within 3,000 miles of her.  Why?  She pre-taped.  Oh, oh, oh.  I thought you were exaggerating there.  No, she was...  I knew that I wouldn't get that one, because I was trying to set it up.  And then last time I did, which was like a week and a half ago, she had just taped  before that, and they never, ever do that for anybody. 
[01:21:00]  But for her...  Well, she's my daughter.  She's her tour schedule.  Yeah.  Right, right.  So...  Gotta do it for her.  So I did not.  But that was...  Well, it went well.  I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah, it was good.  It was...  Coulda, woulda, shoulda.  We were all just kind of answering these silly questions.  I'm always a day behind your Leno appearances.  I just can't stay up.  Yeah, I never watch it.  I DVR'd, and I check it out.  I'll check it out today.  Can't wait.  Michelle Obama's on tonight.  I wish...  I don't think they would put me on with her, because of the content.  Probably not.  I got away with a couple of fucking doozies last night. 
[01:21:30]  Jay let you do the doozies.  I couldn't believe...  And one that they approved that I didn't do...  Right.  ...was a fucking sperm-drinking joke, and they let...  I just didn't do it, because we had already...  We had already talked about something else.  Based on the Fear Factor thing?  Yeah.  It was a good call.  It's a Fear Factor joke.  Yeah.  Well, because Rogan was on...  I don't know.  It seems like it was yesterday, but it might have been a month ago by now.  Who knows?  And he was teasing the donkey semen thing.  He told us all about it.  We promised we wouldn't talk about it.  But it looks like, what, NBC pulled it?  They said no. 
[01:22:00]  What a dumb move by NBC.  Where's that clip?  I don't know.  I'd love to see it.  They should say no, get everyone talking about it, and then go, oh, all right, knowing it's  totally fine.  Yeah.  Because you know what kind of ratings you would get now if you threw it on TV?  I think it's too much, too close to bestiality.  I think that's the reason.  But isn't it based on something like some society does?  I don't know.  Some societies cut clits off, too.  Ah, true.  You know?  I don't think they're going to be doing that.  True.  You never know, though.  But could you imagine the ratings it would get? 
[01:22:30]  They should have that.  Fear Factor Africa.  Where you go over there and just machete children's arms off and fucking cut clits out with spade  shovels.  Oh, burn schools down.  Or you just leak it online and put a couple ads before it.  Leak it.  Like, just put it online.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe get the word of Joe if he needs, you know, maybe he needs a leak.  Yeah, this is the place to do it.  We're the right guys for the job.  We're pretty leaky here.  You know what?  Our pal Cowhead. 
[01:23:00]  One of the few we like.  Cowhead!  One of the few we like in this business.  A banana.  He didn't die, did he?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Enough of it.  The fucking Todd Lynn?  Jesus Christ.  What happened to him, by the way?  Another comic.  Todd Lynn.  Cancer and diabetes.  He had pancreatic cancer.  He was in bad shape.  You're kidding.  I feel very guilty.  I didn't go see him.  I meant to.  I kept asking Dean Edwards.  Like, I want to go see Todd.  I want to send him something.  Right.  He did our show.  Yeah.  Four or five years ago.  Yeah, man.  When that whole tsunami thing went down.  I like Todd, too.  Argumentative motherfucker, but he was a funny guy to argue with.  And Rocco from AAF. 
[01:23:30]  Rocco, dude.  Let me tell you, dude.  I did that guy's show.  He loved Neander Paul.  That's Paul Marshall.  Paul Marshall.  Yeah, yeah, no.  He kept that.  He was like, you gotta tell me.  I said hello.  He was really cool, man.  He was a very fun guy.  We always liked Paul Marshall.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm glad he's finally going with the big head thing, because we used to call him Fred Flintstone.  Yeah, we called him that.  We called him Big Paul and the Monsters.  Big Paul and the Monsters.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, we called him that.  Paul Marshall, for the people that don't know, he worked at AAF when we did.  He was absolutely good enough to have his own show, but he was just kind of like the filling guy. 
[01:24:00]  He did everyone else's show, even though he was better than most of the guys there.  And he really wanted to make something of himself in the business and moved out to Arizona.  And now he calls himself what?  Neanderthal?  Neanderthal, right.  Because he's got a big head.  That's Paul Marshall.  We know him.  Oh, yeah.  I always liked that guy.  He was a very nice guy.  He was cool, too, because we used to come up with a million nicknames for his big head,  and he just went with it.  He's one of those guys that just went with it.  Yeah, he was quite a blockhead.  It was good to do his show?  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  I did a couple breaks with him.  But I had, sorry, eggs.  Ooh.  I had no TV in Arizona.  I just did a few phoners and his show.  I get no morning press whatsoever on Friday.  They couldn't get me any.  They had one radio show.  They canceled me.  No.  And all three TV stations said no.  Why would they cancel you?  What?  It was a sports station, and they said they had a live remote, which they do once a month.  A lot of these clubs pay every week to get the comedian on, but this is not one of the  stations that they don't pay to get their comics on. 
[01:25:00]  They have to pay to get their comics on.  Tempe doesn't, but so many other clubs do.  Yeah, that's a new thing now.  That's a...  Wow.  Yeah, because you're giving the club a free commercial.  Oh, my.  So these radio stations, they don't realize they're also getting really good content.  Yeah.  So now they have to fucking...  They have to monetize this in some way.  They have to goon arm the clubs and make them pay now.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  And they probably put on a lot of comedians they normally wouldn't.  And you can always tell when you're going into a place that it's just taking you because 
[01:25:30]  you're one of the guys in the club and not...  Yeah.  I guess that way it's bad.  So I did amazing there, considering I had almost no press.  Did you do any hiking or anything?  What?  In Arizona?  They got some nice little fucking hills to hike.  Yeah, from my fucking bed to the toilet to drop a nice deuce.  No hiking.  Did you see the sights?  If by the sights you mean the fucking cradle of a massage table, you bet I did.  Pushing my asshole back like a cat.  No, I didn't...  I don't do anything on the road. 
[01:26:00]  I know, man.  I loved it.  What about these new fucking cities that you don't go to off in?  Like Arizona.  Nah.  I mean, you know, it's not that I wouldn't go out and see it, but I just didn't...  I was like, what was I going to do?  Because you're there...  Kenny and I went out for a really nice dinner on Thursday night.  I saw the picture you tweeted.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You used to see him like a dead person.  Kenny's just like, oh, yeah.  Like a lump.  But Friday, it's like you're doing two shows.  You start 7.30.  You're not back in the room until 1.  Right.  Um, argue...  It's in the top five or top three best clubs I've ever done. 
[01:26:30]  Massive, well-run, 550 seats.  Damn.  So I didn't sell it out, but I did really fucking good.  So, nice.  And that's the first time you've ever played there?  Yeah.  I did Celebrity Theater with Dyson Bill Maher many, many years ago.  Right.  But, uh, this is my first time...  Oh, Tom Green's parents came, too.  Oh, really?  His mom and dad did come, yeah.  I saw him tweeting you about that as well.  Oh, did he?  I didn't see that.  Yeah.  Were you here for Tom Green?  Yeah.  I get all...  I was here with Tom, sure.  I was here with Tom.  Oh, okay.  But he said his parents might come see me, and they actually did. 
[01:27:00]  Right, right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, the Tom Green thing got out of hand, man.  That other Tom Green is really fucking...  Yeah, he's an idiot.  That other...  The fake Tom Green.  The fake Tom Green is not taking the joke too well.  No.  No, he's one of those guys.  There might be problems there.  They made up, though.  Yeah.  They did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't think so.  All right, good.  Tom Green's parents were cool?  They were very nice, yeah.  They were very, very nice.  They got to be pretty old by now.  Yeah.  They're probably in their 60s.  That's nothing.  Late 60s? 
[01:27:30]  That's easy.  By the way, I'm sorry.  I did one more.  Reading Daryl Hammond's book.  Really?  Fucking unbelievable.  I know we have him, I think, in like a few days.  Next week.  Holy fuck, dude.  What?  I thought of you a few times.  He's pretty honest?  Oh, it's brutal.  Yeah?  There's some parts of it that are...  It's just about staying up in SNL of his whole life, but there are some things that have  happened to him that are...  Give us one.  It won't kill his book.  His mother used to take the covers off of outlets and put his fingers in the electrical 
[01:28:00]  outlets.  Jesus.  Why would she do that?  I don't know.  Jesus.  I haven't gotten that far, but I'm ripping through this book.  I didn't...  We didn't have shit like that, thank God.  Jesus, really?  No.  I knew he had a mama thing.  There were a couple of things she did that made me think of you, though.  Yeah.  But nothing like abuse-wise, just one thing she would do that you've talked about.  Which one?  Standing in the doorway watching you sleep.  Oh, she had that, too?  She would wake up and she would just see her standing in the... 
[01:28:30]  I'm a horrible sleeper, man.  I would scream.  I'm a horrible sleeper to this day.  She would make sure we were still breathing, would be inches away from our face, and you wake  up like, what the fuck is this?  Scare the shit out of you.  Wow.  Yeah, but that was her issue.  She was always scared that, you know, we were dead.  She was always scared we were dead.  He said one time when he was like four, his mother was cradling him, holding him in the  kitchen.  Right.  And she took a serrated steak knife and just started cutting his tongue.  What?  Wow! 
[01:29:00]  What?  With the steak knife.  So, how long was he in that environment?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm halfway through the book.  She obviously has major mental issues.  Oh, a sociopath, I think.  Holy fuck.  But it sounds to me like it came back.  I think it came back to him as years went on.  Yeah.  So, I haven't gotten, I'm sure he's going to go back to it.  But, uh...  Holy fuck, that's horrible.  Yeah.  But it's fun reading, because I know so many of the people that he's talking about, and  I remember...  I was in the...  I remember we had the same manager, Maureen, and Barry Katz, and I remember being in the 
[01:29:30]  car with him, I think, while he was still going through the audition process of SNL.  So, it's interesting to hear it.  Oh, wow.  Back in, like, 95 or something.  Do we have a copy?  I've got to start reading that.  Dude, it's so good.  It's...  I'm going to be...  I'm almost trying to slow down, because I'm going to be done with this book so quickly.  Really?  Yeah.  Amazing.  If Roland's around, if he's got a copy, I want to read some of that shit before he gets  in here.  That's horrible.  It was a couple of Lulu's.  Glad to say I didn't have it like that.  No.  We had some weird mental shit.  That's some physical abuse right there.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  I don't know that...  Cutting his tongue with a fucking serrated... 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  I don't think we really had...  That's harsh.  I don't really think we had much physical abuse.  My stepsister abso-fucking-lutely did.  Abso-fucking-lutely did.  But I don't think we did.  Unless I'm blocking it out.  Maybe.  But over the years, me and my brothers and my sister talk about it, and it seems like  we didn't have the physical shit.  I hope I don't have a borderline personality disorder.  Why?  I don't know.  He was just talking about those.  I'm like, do I have that?  Oh, God.  I was like, yeah.  Is that me?  Oh, no.  Do I have that thing? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, no.  Not?  I want to go back to living when none of this shit was invented yet.  Right.  Yeah.  People are just dummies or didn't pay attention or...  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, that guy's, you know, he's got a split personality.  Yeah, we didn't have that growing up.  No.  I don't...  I used to like your joke about that, where you talked about, was it...  Oh, you have OCD.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to do your joke.  I'll do it horribly, but basically...  Sorry, I did too.  Nah.  It was a great bit.  I think it was just... 
[01:31:00]  It was saying, you know, your parents would say, just stop doing that.  Yeah, you're an asshole.  You're an asshole, and wouldn't acknowledge that it could be something deeper than that.  I think we're better off.  Yeah.  Without all these things they've decided...  I think it's the drug industry creating these things to sell prescriptions.  Colin had a funny joke years ago about how in the 40s or whatever, when a woman had a problem,  like now they address the problems, but back then they would just tell you to go buy a hat.  Oh, really?  That's what you need to go get a new hat.  Well, she seems to have hysteria. 
[01:31:30]  Give her these tranquilizers and have her relax for a while.  Really?  Yeah, fuck what's going on.  But those old fucking World War II veterans and stuff, on this show we were talking about  those guys, how they wish they had someone to talk to back then, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's hard for them.  It's like, that was not the way to do it, because they're like, we had no one to talk to.  Because they'd get...  Oh, Brewer was.  Jim Brewer was talking about that.  They'd get, like, they'd call it shell shock and stuff like that until it became post-traumatic  stress disorder, you know? 
[01:32:00]  And they would just be like, yeah, he has shell shock.  Shell shock.  Sounds horrible.  And then they'd just send them home.  All right, deal with it.  And there was some special I saw on World War II guys, and they were talking about those  guys saying, we had no one to talk to.  We just didn't talk about it.  And they just sat on it for fucking years and years.  Seeing heads exploded open in front of them.  There's a story like that in Daryl's book.  It was a different generation.  It wasn't cool to talk about your emotions if you were a guy.  It's still not cool, in a way, you know? 
[01:32:30]  There's a story in there where he talks about, like, his dad was in World War II.  And he was in, I guess, some battle where they got massacred.  And the Germans were walking around just shooting survivors.  And I think his father was laying next to a guy, and the guy's head was blown apart.  So he took some of the guy's brains and threw them on his own face.  Oh, man.  So they would think he was dead.  And that was how he survived.  Shit.  It's amazing what you'll do, right?  When there's Germans walking around shooting living people. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Where's...  Fucking faggot pussy.  What did he say?  Fucking faggots all left me.  In platoon.  Where's Daryl Hammond's father in this whole story?  How did he deal with that shit?  That I haven't gotten to yet.  But that's funny.  I've been curious about that myself.  He hasn't...  I felt more sorry for my dad than anyone else in our situation.  Because he really believed that things could be better.  And he really believed he could find a cure for my mom's issues. 
[01:33:30]  And watching through his eyes would break our heart.  Because he just thought he could turn the whole fucking thing around.  And it was way beyond what he could handle.  I don't know if his dad...  I don't know how his dad dealt with that.  Or if there was like...  I don't know.  I haven't gotten to that part yet.  But it'll be interesting to ask him if he doesn't talk about it in the book.  Because I'm wondering that too.  The greatest gift my dad gave us was like being...  He would...  What am I trying to say?  He would keep her away from us.  In a lot of ways. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He would be in the middle of all the craziness.  So we didn't see half the shit that he was dealing with.  Fuck yeah.  That was the greatest gift though, man.  He realized...  Running block.  He ran block.  Thank you.  That's where I was at.  It's an unhealthy family environment.  Oh yeah, of course.  You know, what the fuck?  But who didn't?  Huh?  Yeah, of course.  But who didn't have those?  Well, when you talk about it, that's what you learn.  Yeah.  That a lot of people...  There's not many people out there that skated and had the normal fucking family upbringing.  Perfect family. 
[01:34:30]  That's what you learn.  Yeah.  Except for Sam, who appears to have it.  Oh, that's Sam.  But there was a lot of mental illness in that house.  Oh yeah, still is.  A lot of mental illness in that house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Roberts house.  More than all of us combined, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  There's that much?  Yeah, I think so.  A fucking horror movie just called The Roberts.  And it's like on the outside.  You know, you can see the trailer.  On the outside, they were the perfect American family.  Nice music.  You're playing together.  Your mom's baking.  You're fucking watching wrestling.  Your dad's eating the greatest treats known to man. 
[01:35:00]  Can we go with Salisbury Hill for that part of the movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Little Peter Gabriel.  Yeah.  All nice.  That go-to song.  Yeah, see?  Oh, look.  There's Sam.  He's sitting with his family watching WrestleMania.  Look, look at that.  Oh, there's Mrs. Roberts.  She's baking.  And look, Mr. Roberts comes up and he's got some flour in his hand.  And he gives her a lovely little tap on the cheek.  And now she's got flour.  She takes her hands, puts them on her hips and goes, oh, makes that all you face. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, and now he's waxing his mustache in the mirror.  And you're next to him, making like you're waxing a mustache, but you don't have one.  And you both laugh together.  It's great.  Now the movie needs to turn.  Yeah.  Then the music suddenly turns a little more ominous.  But what's the turn?  It always has to be something where it's maybe just a mom alone.  Sam is duct taping his dick down between his legs to be a girl.  He wants to be a girl.  That's a hell of a turn. 
[01:36:00]  And the camera pans down when he's doing his little boyish pretend mustache to his penis,  which is bloated with urine because he's uncircumcised.  And then his father takes his fists and collapses them on the end.  He punches Sam's penis from both sides.  Both sides.  Squeezes it out.  And it bursts like a balloon on the floor and Sammy cries.  Yes.  Oh, we go with this music?  There was a secret in the Roberts' house.  A secret no one knew until now. 
[01:36:30]  Ah, see?  And then we can do that whole thing now.  Sam's tucking his penis.  And then Mr. Roberts, for some reason, this is just characters.  This isn't really your family.  It's characters.  Mr. Roberts just fucking blasts his fist into Mrs. Roberts' face while she's cooking.  Wow.  I'll tell you why.  Because he kisses her and he smells cocoa butter on her breath.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  And little Sam is curled up in the corner of his bed crying. 
[01:37:00]  Flipping nickels.  Yeah.  Flipping quarters off his ankle.  I just want to go back to watching WrestleMania.  And crying.  Yeah, but that's not going to happen now, is it?  Your father bursts in and it's like ominous darkness.  The only light is a little strip on his eyes.  His mustache.  And his mustache.  And he grabs your wrestling figures and starts just throwing them out.  No.  And you're like, no, daddy, daddy, no, no.  And he goes, shut up.  He belts you in the fucking face.  Yeah.  I like this movie.  Because you've eaten his crackers and he's trying to have the world's greatest treat.  Right. 
[01:37:30]  And he realizes he has buttermilk and nothing to crumble up into it.  No.  He's very angry.  That would upset him.  Yeah.  So he breaks your fucking Jeff Horton figure.  What's that guy's name?  I couldn't have.  There's no name Jeff Horton.  Yeah.  I think there's no name.  You're Larry Peters wrestling figure.  That's bad wrestling names.  You think so?  It's unmarketable.  How about Jeff the Skipper Horton?  Jeff the Skipper Horton.  Is that a good name?  No.  The Skipper. 
[01:38:00]  How can they market that?  Yeah.  What music is this from?  The Shawshank.  But then it all ends up happy?  No.  No.  It's very tragic.  The whole family is slowly.  Is this music similar to American Beauty?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  What was the song from American Beauty that was kind of like this?  It is similar.  It is?  Because I was going to go with American Beauty here.  All right.  We should break.  Let Jimmy eat.  Settle in a little bit. 
[01:38:30]  When we get back, we got the clip from Cowhead Show.  I didn't forget.  He talked to the girl who drank the donkey semen that NBC is not going to air now.  He got the exclusive interview with her.  That's pretty fucking cool for him.  And also, you saw the UFC fights on Fox, Jimmy?  I did, yes.  God.  Dana needs a fucking good show, man.  That's two in a row that were just kind of sat there, right?  Well, these were...  They all went the distance.  I thought the Rashad-Phil Davis fight had some really great moments. 
[01:39:00]  I mean, some great striking moments.  Rashad was so frustrated, though.  Yeah.  He wanted to knock him out.  He needed to knock him out because now he's going to face Jon Jones.  Jon Jones is going to kill him.  And Chael looked very tight.  Chael, I think he gassed a little bit.  Rogan was saying it had something to do with a weight cut.  But at least the fights weren't the distance.  I would take that.  But I think Dana really wants some action now that he's on Fox.  Like a Dan Henderson fucking Shogun fight.  That's one of the best fights ever. 
[01:39:30]  Just an amazing knockout or something.  Yeah.  I think he would really like that.  He'll get that.  I mean, they'll be with Fox for years and years.  It's brand new.  Yeah.  It's like they've had a couple of games already.  The first game was a 17-1 blowout.  And the second game was kind of a pitcher's blowout.  Like, there's been no games that were like 9-6 with this, like, equal amount of action and defense.  I think we all like our home runs, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.  He needs a couple home runs.  Yeah.  We like to see a game that's kind of a...  But good for Dana.  He's on Fox, you know?  Yeah.  It'll be cool. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know who the next Fox fight is.  When we get back, we've got to play the Joe Rogan...  What's the guy's name?  Chael Sonnen.  Chael, right.  Chael Sonnen.  Oh, yeah.  At the end.  That was pretty amazing.  Did you see this end yet?  No, I haven't seen this one.  And Sam Roberts.  Thank God for Sam Roberts today.  What?  I know.  But he noticed that what that guy was saying was very similar to an old wrestler named Superstar  Billy Graham.  Really?  All right.  He stole some shit from Superstar Billy Graham.  He was inspired. 
[01:40:30]  He was inspired, you're going to call it?  We'll play that audio next.  So stay there.  Hey, this is John Belby.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Dad.  Hey, folks.  This is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPale.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony Show, my favorite show in the history of the  fucking universe.  I should mention that we got, who we got? 
[01:41:00]  Steven Van Zandt coming in today.  Yes.  Maybe we could talk to him about a picture for Roland.  We got to get that done.  Roland's got to get his picture with Bruce Springsteen.  That's all he wants in life.  That's all Roland wants.  Yep.  Jim Norton's back.  Yes.  Yes, I am.  Are you heading out again, though?  No.  I go out.  I'm doing a piece.  I'm going to the Grammys for them.  I'm doing that the 12th, but I only miss one day. 
[01:41:30]  It's a Monday night airing.  I think we taped the 12th and airs the 13th, whatever the night after the Grammys is.  But I don't know what the piece is going to be.  It's going to be about the Grammys.  Yeah, but it's talking to celebrities on the line, which is much as I'm a celebrity whore  and I love them.  Bits like that are kind of hard.  Right.  Because they're all nervous, and they're not going to give you much.  They're being rushed through by publicists.  And the Grammys are fucking...  Yeah, but you got the Jay Leno mic flag.  They don't care because everybody's there.  And they're not going to engage you in a real bit because they're running into what is a major event for them. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  So they'll say hello, but I don't know what I'll get.  I have to think of a bit, or we have to think of a bit, me and those guys.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Something about a bit?  A bit.  Something I ain't going to know.  Hey, we got the girl who drank the donkey semen.  Yay.  A fear factor.  Rogan told us about this, and Rogan didn't really want to tell us much at the time.  He told us off air, and he knew that this was probably going to be a problem.  Unfortunately, fear factor is not going to... NBC is not going to run that fear factor. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, they're not going to let some woman drink donkey semen.  So, Cowhead, one of our guys we do like in this business, he got an exclusive interview with the woman that did just that.  And unfortunately, it's not going to be on NBC.  This is how it went down.  Oh, so you didn't have to just chug it in one slug?  It goes...  Like, you can milk it?  I guess that's not the right word.  How much did they have to drink?  A big glass, I heard.  Yeah, a bunch. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Can we get...  A mug.  Can we get Pat Duffy to do this for the show?  They won't allow it here, right?  That's a bad move by NBC not to air it, though, because, like...  I know.  You gotta...  You know, you're worried about fucking HBO and FX and show...  This is...  Cable kills you guys...  Right.  ...or is coming up and killing...  What a dumb move it is, just to push you out on it.  I want to know the backstory about the donkey semen, you know, because they usually have a tie-in.  Like, well, this particular tribe does it for health reasons or whatever.  I want to know what that's about.  There has to be a reason.  Because if they have that going for them, then they could throw it on NBC. 
[01:43:30]  Can you imagine you drink donkey cum and it doesn't make the air?  You do that and it doesn't make it?  And then it gets cut.  Oh, man.  That is bad.  No one will ever see your face on TV.  That is bad.  You can slow sip it?  Yeah.  Well, what happened was you got 15 minutes and if you vomited, you would have to start over.  Oh!  What I ended up doing was just vomited in my glass and just drank that.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, man!  Wow!  Hey.  So, yeah, that was probably the hardest.  Every radio guy's jealous.  Hold on.  So you drank half a glass?  The cameramen were vomiting, so...  Yeah.  I mean, I got to tell you, I don't puke easy.  And when I saw the glass, I just looked at it for a second and I felt like puking.  All right, so walk me through this.  When you bring it to your mouth, do you smell?  Is the smell horrendous or does it smell like nothing?  Oh, it smells.  It's so bitter. 
[01:44:30]  It's the best thing you can ever imagine and it has, you know, a little hint of hay.  Just answer it.  Answer it, okay?  I'm assuming you've had human semen before, correct?  I mean, you're an adult girl.  I plead the fifth.  Yeah, but the reason why I'm going to ask you is just for the comparison.  Yeah.  It's way sicker.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Would you try donkey semen ant? 
[01:45:00]  What?  Why even ask?  I know.  Would you try Jimmy?  No.  If others were trying, I would try it.  Wouldn't you?  What other would you try?  No, I don't want to be the only person.  You never want to be the only guy sephing donkey come at the party.  That is a real thing.  And then realize no one else is going to try it.  Fucking disgusting, man.  No, I'm not good at doing ingesting stuff like that.  Like, I can't.  I would get very queasy.  Oh, my God.  Well, it's Mr. Cowhead on Twitter. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you, Mr. Cowhead, for that exclusive clip there.  That's where you wish he was on satellite because he could really...  Even though he did a pretty good job there, I mean, of saying what he had to say.  CBS lawyers would have dumped out of half of that.  Without a doubt.  They would have dumped out of half of that.  I know where all the dumps would have been.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's still very fresh in my mind.  They wouldn't have been able to say semen, donkey, because that's too close to ass.  Right?  Yeah, they stink.  That's their logic over there. 
[01:46:00]  This guy wants to explain to you.  All right, all right, fine.  Let's go to Brian in Chicago.  He has a little more to add to this story.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Brian.  How are you today?  I'm doing good.  How's Chicago?  Everything's good?  You having a good winter?  How much snow you got on the ground?  What's the temperature today?  Hey!  All right, sorry.  Hey!  He just yells at you.  It exploded.  Go ahead, Brian.  All right.  The reason I'm calling is that I know that Jimmy had made a remark on how cable kills broadcast, 
[01:46:30]  but when it comes to the fragmentation and how many channels they have, look, I run the sales department for NBC Affiliate.  They decided not to air it, apparently.  I haven't been in the office this morning, but yesterday they were going to air the episode.  The importance is that broadcast reaches so many more people than cable does.  I mean, cable is only wired for 54% of the country, so no matter how much money an advertiser spends on cable, 46% of the population would never, ever see their ads. 
[01:47:00]  So when NBC comes down with the decision not to air this, I think that bad press is good press.  I think eventually it's going to come out.  We're going to have to air it.  But when it comes to the amount of people that broadcast is reaching compared with cable, there is no comparison.  When you see a cable overnight rating, they're combining all the cable channels together, and it still does not hold a candle to what broadcast,  regardless of what network you're talking about. 
[01:47:30]  You know, and I do know that you're right, cable does not reach, I shouldn't say they're killing them, they're doing more viewers,  but they really are making broadcast TV look soft and irrelevant, and they've been doing it with their dramas,  and with their comedies, the content, but you're right, an episode of a network sitcom that does okay will do better than any comedy on FX, HBO.  No, I mean, I should have said that better. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  No sweat.  No, it's strange.  It's 54% of the country is wired for cable.  Where is that 46%?  Where is that?  They're watching by antenna, or they're watching by DirecTV, or they're watching by dish.  Oh, I see.  Okay, so there are people getting some of these other shows just in another way.  All right, so they can still get the other channels, yeah.  I got you.  Yeah, but remember, those affiliates are broadcast on spot satellites in the area, 
[01:48:30]  so if there's an NBC affiliate there in New York, it's on cable, it's on DISH, it's on DirecTV, and it's on antenna.  Yeah.  It reaches 99% of the population.  You know what?  I think it's out of habit, because to this day, I'll always go 2457.  Those are the networks, basically, right?  It's changing for younger people, though.  2557, every day, I'll just see what's on those channels.  I don't know why.  You know there's nothing on there anymore, for the most part.  We grew up with it, but I mean, people who are 20 and 25 now, and even younger, they won't do that. 
[01:49:00]  And I think that's where...  They've just got to grow up, and then you'll see the numbers change, I think.  Yeah, I mean, look at late-night TV.  Look at Leno, Letterman, Conan.  Look at all of these guys combined.  I mean, and look what Carson did.  That shows you how it's just being split up among so many more outlets.  And I think that's where cable hurts them a lot.  Well, I think with all the attention NBC's getting, they should throw this fear factor on.  Online, at least.  Do it somewhere, yeah.  Yeah, maybe online with the warning and... 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, they can't just let that not see the light of day.  Right.  Come on.  And what was the other thing?  It was donkey urine as well?  Yeah.  Yes, Brian.  I've got one more thing to say.  Prefaces it like that, and then hangs up on it.  No, we kind of knew that.  I don't know what he was going for there.  Except rudeness.  We kind of knew that.  Of course.  So you got Shale Sonnen, post-UFC fight promo.  Everyone's talking about this.  And I thought it was fantastic. 
[01:50:00]  And then Sam gets a hold of it and says,  Fuck, man, he's ripping off superstar Billy Graham.  To be fair, somebody called into the show on Sunday and alerted me that...  Oh, you didn't know yourself.  You're slacking on your wrestling knowledge.  Well, I just...  It was from 1975.  So?  You got that tape in your closet somewhere, right?  Well, I was able to...  Thank you, yeah.  I was able to find the superstar Billy Graham promo after the guy called in.  Oh.  And told me.  In your collection?  No, online.  Online.  YouTube.  See, then why do you collect all that shit when you just went to YouTube to find it? 
[01:50:30]  He's an OCD zoch.  Oh, my God.  Are you a wreck?  Because he thinks YouTube eventually will go,  You know what?  We don't need this old stuff online anymore.  It's taking up too much space.  Or if they say that's copyright, you can't have it on YouTube anymore.  Stop.  Now it's gone.  See?  Your stuff is becoming just completely a waste of time and space.  It is.  Mm-hmm.  Your stuff is becoming a waste of time and space.  Yeah, so is your hat.  I used to collect baseball cards when there was only one company.  Then there were two companies.  I said, all right, I'll still collect baseball cards.  And then you fast forward a few years, and there's like 20 fucking companies.  Yeah.  And you're like, I can't keep up with this anymore, so I just let it go. 
[01:51:00]  Do you have the Ken Griffey, Don Rush third year?  No, I don't.  No, I want the tops.  Growing up, it was cool, man.  Get a complete set, and then it didn't matter anymore because there were too many companies involved.  Fleer.  Right.  And then it got easy to get complete sets, and then it just didn't matter anymore.  I have the Jim Abbott reverse number Fleer, seventh year in the league.  The camera was fixed wrong, and his number's reversed.  It's the Jim Abbott.  Not the moment where he's standing, but it's the moment where he's throwing.  And his shirt is flopping because there's no arm there. 
[01:51:30]  I see.  Remember if a card had like a slight double print that made it worth a lot of money?  All these weird little things.  Look, it's the Mark Fidrich, but his hat is backwards.  Ooh.  Give you a buck seventy for it.  Or like they got traded right around the time the picture was being taken, so they didn't  have the right team on his chest when the cards came out, and that was a big deal.  It was all these things.  The point being, Sam, you don't need to collect tapes anymore, just like I didn't need to 
[01:52:00]  collect baseball cards anymore after a while.  That's why I slowed down buying wrestling figures.  Now I just buy one of each guy, not every single repaint that comes out.  What's a repaint?  They just paint them in the new outfits, but it's the same figure, just different shirt  on.  So you can't keep up with the wrestling figures?  I just buy one of each guy, for the most part, unless there's a drastic change.  So when you started collecting wrestling figures, because we got a lot of collectors out there,  it was just one version of each guy?  Yeah, like when I was a kid, it was like...  So it was easy, like, alright, I got them all. 
[01:52:30]  I would want to get the whole set.  Right.  Like everyone, but now it's like they put them out.  It's like if the Ralph Sherbert came out.  You'd say, like, I gotta get the Ralph the Foot Sherbert.  I've never heard of Ralph the Foot Sherbert.  See, you don't have that action figure.  What's wrong with you?  I don't want it.  You're behind.  It's a terrible wrestling name.  Alright, so we got UFC Shell, Sonnen, talking to Rogan after his fight.  Was his fight impressive?  Because I actually tuned in.  He had a tougher time with Bisping than I think he thought he would.  Yeah.  Bisping's a good boxer, and his wrestling defense was really good, because Shell's a fucking... 
[01:53:00]  I describe it as a nightmare to fight.  Yeah.  Because he's all over you, and he throws you on the ground.  Ooh.  And, uh...  Yeah, it was very sexy.  But he had a hard time with Bisping, but I think that Bisping was a last-minute replacement for this guy Munoz, so he hadn't trained to fight him.  Right.  And Bisping was, um...  It was a...  It was a split...  It was a unanimous decision.  But I wasn't sure how it was going to go.  Right. 
[01:53:30]  But, you know, Shell seemed to win it.  Shell or Shell?  Uh, Shell.  Shell.  Shell Sunnen.  Shell Sunnen.  So afterwards, he talked to Joe Rogan.  Alright, I'm here with the winner, Shell Sunnen.  First of all, Shell, congratulations.  A very tough fight.  Michael Bisping showed he had some, uh, great takedown defense.  He surprised you at all in this fight.  Joe Rogan, tonight is not for questions for me.  This is your night, brother.  I want to know how you feel being only inches away from greatness.  I want you to tell everybody how it feels. 
[01:54:00]  Are you not mesmerized?  Do you not have chills going up your spine for the first time on a box for you to be here?  Oh, boy.  Shell's octagon on Shell's channel, holding Shell's microphone, interviewing Shell.  I'm pretty excited.  I got to tell you.  When you're thinking about that, remember this.  When you're the greatest fighter in the world today, they got a name for you.  They don't call you a great fighter.  They call you Shell Sunnen.  Beat me.  If you can.  If you smell what the Shells is cooking.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Someone online saying Shell is doing a bit. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, we know that.  Yeah.  We know that.  Doing a promo.  And we thought it was impressive, but then Sam got to the bottom of this, and it's very  similar to what superstar Billy Graham did in 1975, and we have the clip.  Oh, wow.  His last line was Taz's old line, too.  What was the line?  Taz used to say, beat me if you can, survive if I let you.  So he left off, survive if I let you.  He said, I'm Shell's son, and beat me if you can.  So he's a big wrestling fan, obviously.  He's got to be.  Well, CM Punk was supposed to walk him down the aisle, but Vince McMahon put the kibosh on it.  Did he really? 
[01:55:00]  Why would he do that?  Yeah, that's some good cross-promotion.  You got your big wrestler in a UFC event getting exposure?  Maybe he wanted him in St. Louis the night before, because the Royal Rumble was the next  day.  I don't know.  Wow, that kind of seems kind of dumb.  You have a choice to make, Buster.  You can just see him getting all mad at him.  You want to go?  Go.  Well, you don't come back, then.  You don't even come back to the WWE.  He's the champion.  See how they fucking retreat you over there in the octagon? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  He did get mad.  Vince?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  He doesn't like sharing.  Does Shane talk to Vince anymore?  What's going on there?  I would assume that there's still a familial relationship.  Barely, though, right?  What's going on there?  He's not professional.  He doesn't work for WWE anymore.  Why did Shane say, I'm moving on from the family business?  I guess he wanted to do other things.  And he hasn't popped up anywhere.  What's going on there?  No, that's weird.  He's a sports agent.  International sports agent.  Yeah.  Show me the money guy.  He was on that golf team over the weekend. 
[01:56:00]  Dubai?  Yeah.  Well said.  Rory McAllister is, or McElroy, whatever his name is, is one of his clients.  McElroy.  Oh, my God.  You're killing the golf people out there.  You're just full of tense of facts.  Rory McElroy is from Northern Ireland.  Hey.  He's doing golf stuff, and he's doing really good.  He's a young kid.  I was in Ireland, don't you know?  Hey, hey, hey.  Shane has a connection to him?  Yeah, he hangs out with him.  How the fuck does that do that, Ant?  That's amazing.  What is that? 
[01:56:30]  It's a...  ADD radio.  Airplane.  What was that?  A carrier?  F-35.  Well, it's based on the same thing.  It's a vertical takeoff and landing.  Is it a brand new vehicle?  Yeah, it's relatively new.  Brand new plane?  Why are they showing it today?  Because they're grounding, like, 15 of them.  Why?  Were they late for their homework or something?  Oh, no.  Not like that.  They're not grounded.  Why are they grounding them?  I guess they got a problem.  I guess they got to fix some shit.  Oh, that's why.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what?  That thing lifts off like a helicopter and then takes off?  Yeah, and then it leans forward and goes... 
[01:57:00]  And then the wings take over.  How do we get in one of those?  I don't know, man.  I want to check that out.  They do give ride-alongs to certain people in those things.  Yeah.  Fighter planes.  So, Shane has a connection to Rory?  Yeah, he hangs out with him.  Eric, this is your story.  Get on mic, please.  Yeah.  He, uh, the, the, uh, sports management company that he works for represents Rory and Shane  represents Rory as well.  Wow.  All right.  So Shane's doing well.  And another golfer, Darren Clark.  And he's trying to work out pay-per-view in China.  Darren Clark won the, uh, did he win the U.S. Open this year? 
[01:57:30]  He's the old guy.  I think he did, yeah.  And he loves his booze, eh?  Oh, yeah?  It's Darren Clark, yeah.  Came out of nowhere and won.  Quite a few golfers like their fucking drink, huh?  Uh, John Daly used to.  Not the new guys.  The new guys are goody two-shoes.  They all work out and just eat properly and, you know.  Tiger.  How about Phil Mickelcunt?  Does he drink?  You don't like him?  I hate him.  Why?  He chokes every time.  Yeah.  He's a big choker.  I hate him.  The only one who choked over the weekend is Tiger Woods.  Wow. 
[01:58:00]  He was leading the tournament.  Diddy.  One day, one round to go and finished two strokes back.  Tied for, I think, third place in Abu Dhabi.  But people are saying he's better because he did well.  Oh, so he's playing better at least?  I think he probably should have won that tournament, though, man.  Anyway, here's 1975 Billy Graham, superstar Billy Graham doing the promo that Chael took from.  I don't want you to ask me any questions.  I want to ask you a question. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  How does it feel right now?  You.  How do you feel for the first time in your life standing, actually talking, actually holding  a microphone, actually interviewing superstar Billy Graham?  Tell me the truth.  Are you not mesmerized?  Are chills not going up and down your skinny little spine?  Are your boots not shaking? 
[01:59:00]  Are you not actually standing this close to the body?  By the way, don't touch me.  Don't ever touch my arm.  Don't ever touch my body.  I remember superstar Billy Graham being more impressive than that.  Yeah.  That's not...  He's not that good on the mic.  He was good.  Who was he talking to?  Vince.  Oh, it was Vince.  Was it?  Back in 1975.  His big, fluffy hair sideburns.  When Vince was always looking up like, oh, oh, he was the mic guy, right?  Yeah.  He was the announcer.  He was the announcer.  And he used to interview these guys and just be like, oh, he's always looking perplexed 
[01:59:30]  at them.  Ah, I thought Billy Superstar was better than that on the mic.  Well, for 1975, nobody was doing stuff like that then.  Is that Vince all the way on the right there?  The left, I mean?  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was just...  No, down.  Oh, my God.  Like, all buffed up?  Is that...  That's Benoit.  No, no, up one.  No, no, up there.  That's Vince.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  An animal.  Oh, yeah.  That's not Photoshopped.  Like, fuck Jesus Christ. 
[02:00:00]  That's Photoshopped.  Well, he's Photoshopped into a gym, I think.  Well, no, the face is Photoshopped.  You can see it.  You think?  Yeah.  Look at that neck.  He is ripped, or used to be.  He's pretty much that big.  Yeah, that'd be crazy.  That's Photoshopped.  He worked, well, he might have got a little something-something.  A little action.  Might have got a little taste.  Back in the day.  A little stuff in the day.  Might have got a bit of a taste.  Was that Billy Graham?  Was he actually...  Was he he had fought right there?  Was that when he beat Arthur Beals for the title?  There's no wrestler named Arthur Beals. 
[02:00:30]  Definitely not a title holder.  Arthur Laces Beals.  You just don't know your guys.  I don't remember him.  You're not a big fan of wrestling, apparently.  Laces?  Arthur Laces Beals.  B-I-E-E-L-S.  It was a weird name.  Norwegian.  Bad name.  That's not Vince.  That's Photoshopped.  That's Vince.  Yeah, that's Photoshopped, though.  All right.  So there you go.  That's a badass.  That's a good find.  Most people didn't know where that came from.  Sam Roberts.  And why was he doing that? 
[02:01:00]  Just as a goof?  He's obviously a wrestling fan.  Went with it.  It's called talking people into the building, Anthony.  Talking people into the building.  Ah, see, I'm learning something.  Yes.  Something that means nothing, but at least I'm learning.  That's wrestling.  Come on.  Come on, Roberts.  What are you thinking?  What's going on?  Roberts.  What's going on with our pal, Louis C.K.?  He's going to do a pilot for CBS now.  What?  Yeah, it's apparently something he came up with with Spike Ferriston, who he had in that  time 13 years ago.  Wow. 
[02:01:30]  And they just picked it up now.  I guess, yeah.  I don't know any of the details on it.  What's going to happen with the other show on Spike?  On FX, you mean?  I mean, FX.  Oh, nothing.  I don't even know if Louis is in this one or if he's just going to be exec producing it.  Probably going to exec produce.  I just don't know.  All right.  Man, exec produce means money, money, money.  Oh, boy.  Money, money, money.  Oh, boy.  Is that exec produce a good credit to have?  I think your boy, Mitt Romney, sang a little song yesterday.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Florida primary.  Romney is kicking Newt's ass is the headline here. 
[02:02:00]  If there is any, any question that Mitt Romney is as white as they come, not an ounce of  African blood in him, it comes out in this tune.  Which makes you happy?  Uh, sure.  Get my vote.  I don't know.  Why would he sing this?  I think he's trying to get a patriotic moment together.  Right.  And it just comes off as hokey.  Uncomfortable.  And so poorly sang. 
[02:02:30]  It's just seems out of touch.  He's a real douche.  Yeah, he just comes off as a douche.  But that douche will get my vote.  I'm reading between the lines, though.  I think you were hoping for someone a little different.  Of course I was.  I was hoping for somebody who would overwhelmingly win by a landslide.  But that ain't it.  So, you know, you've got to put your eggs in whatever basket you're given.  And it's got to be the Republican Party's basket.  Why won't Jeb endorse him?  I don't know.  Because Jeb probably doesn't want to be tied to any of his policies and say that he endorsed Romney or Gingrich or anything. 
[02:03:00]  Because I believe at some point he will run.  I think this election, Jeb's a little too close to the past Bush years.  Another four years of Obama.  They love him in Florida, though.  And the country will be completely ready for a Republican president.  And then Jeb Bush can jump in there and see if we get another Bush in the White House.  Jesus Christ, that would be crazy.  How does one family get three presidents? 
[02:03:30]  Amazing, right?  That would be crazy.  And that's from Iraq's home state where he grew up.  FLA.  Born and raised.  FLA, motherfucker.  FLA, USA.  Iraq, you doing an absentee ballot or what?  Are you voting?  I'm registered in New Jersey.  Why?  Why?  Don't say it on the air.  The feds will be all over there.  Oh, man.  When did you move to Jersey?  Six years ago.  From Florida?  Is that when you moved?  Oh, you recently moved into a mansion.  Well, I was going to call it a castle. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You moved into a castle, Iraq?  There is a moat.  Is it Castle Nagel?  Castle Nagel, right?  It's a very nice house.  Castle Nagel.  Castle.  Damn, you inherited some money.  Oh, that's that lottery money.  Houses don't have drawbridges in front of them.  No, his does.  Castle Nagel.  Castle Nagel.  It's got a keep.  Definitely.  Iraq, where did you meet me?  In what state? 
[02:04:30]  State of...  That you remember would be...  Because that you remember.  How many times did I meet you before?  You met me several times before that.  Oh, what a stalker.  Yeah.  What a creep.  And then when I met you in Florida, I...  What?  You pretended that...  I finally acknowledged you?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I have no recollection of ever meeting you before Florida.  I'll see if I can find some old photos.  You even got old photos with us together?  Uh, yeah.  That's fucking creepy. 
[02:05:00]  That's like police activity.  A shrine to you.  And my point being, I met him in Florida.  Right.  The state he's from.  Yeah, yeah.  His home state.  Yeah, not from Florida.  Pretty cool, huh?  That's bullshit.  No.  I think so.  Three years.  You own property in Florida, right?  No, not anymore.  Well, where do you...  Are you going to visit your family?  Real estate mogul.  Real estate mogul.  No.  He's buying.  He's selling.  Castle Nagel is up and running now.  Flipping houses.  Flipping houses.  I met him in Florida.  Pancakes.  His family lives in Florida.  That's where they live?  He owned property in Florida.  Oh. 
[02:05:30]  He's from Florida.  What license plates were on your truck?  At that time?  No, no, no, no.  Like a year ago.  Oh, Florida.  Ah.  There it is.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And do you have bleach in your hair?  That could be anywhere.  That would be Florida.  More Florida than anywhere else.  That's a lot of Florida right there.  When was the last time you used sun in?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here's mid...  You want Mitt Romney singing?  Yeah, it's pretty bad. 
[02:06:00]  He was at a rally.  I guess so.  They love him in Florida.  Can you sing that song?  I love that song.  You know that song?  Oh, beautiful.  No one loves that song.  He lies about everything.  Don't you love that song?  No, you're right.  No one loves that song.  You're pretty much...  Forced to sing it.  ...relegated to have to sit there and listen to it or sing it in certain atmosphere.  No one loves it.  No, no one loves it.  It's patriotic.  It's a utilitarian song.  Not for pleasure.  And I always thought the word was gray, not grain.  Amber waves of gray? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Grain.  I always thought gray.  What would it be amber waves of gray?  I don't know.  The dust bowl?  I thought because of all the smoke from fighting...  Oh, from the bowel.  From the big bowel?  Yes.  No, it's the waves of grain.  From fighting the British.  It looks like water.  When you look at the gray, it looks like waves, but it's gray.  Yeah, waves of gray.  Like, oh, wow, more fucking bombs in the air, and look at all the smoke around.  We owned them, Brits.  We fucking owned them, goddamn English.  By the way...  Kick their ass!  Not even kidding.  What?  I just want to say, sometimes I kid. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not even kidding.  I always thought it was waves of gray.  Amber waves of gray.  Amber shades of gray.  I thought it was a dead song.  Until Mitt Romney sang it.  I'm like...  I even said to myself at first, I think he's singing it wrong.  And then I noticed that press didn't pick up on him singing it wrong, so I'm like, oh, shit.  I've been singing it wrong.  Can you sing that song?  I love that song.  You know that song?  Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountains majesty. 
[02:07:30]  I've got purple mountain majesty in my pants.  You've got purple mountain majesty in my pants.  I've got purple mountain majesty.  Yeah?  America, America, God shed his grace on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood.  From Lango's age, B.T.C.  He loves that song 
[02:08:00]  You know, I love that song  I love that song  Something about a song, you're in a mall, in a store  Something about a song  It's actually a good song  But you don't love it  He must be a real hoot  Loves patriotic songs  Yeah  Chip has a new thing  What is it?  Why do you have to point it out?  Because it's been bothering me all morning  Chip does a thing now where he makes a joke  And then he looks at you  And he tries to elbow you 
[02:08:30]  But he just rubs his forearm on you  Trying to get you to laugh  Every single time he makes a joke  He's been reaching over the chair to elbow me  And rubbing his forearm on me  That is annoying  Chip will never do something that isn't completely annoying  No  Well, anything you do, Chip  Chipper  It's a nice black shirt  What are you, what are you, working at a funeral house or something?  Ah, that's a good one  Get out of here  He rubs his arm 
[02:09:00]  It rubs his forearm  It's not even elbowing  No, it's not like an elbowing  He takes his forearm and places it on you  And pushes slightly  Oh, that is terrible  That's it wrong again  Chip  We're going to do this  We're going to take a break  Because we've got Stephen Van Zandt coming in next  Ah  This is the Opie Anthony Channel  Serious XM  Hey, the girls are dead at home 
[02:09:30]  Don't tell me if you're all alone  There's a bad desire 
[02:10:00]  Oh, I'm on fire  Tell me how this baby is good to you  Or do these things that I can  Bring out a few higher  Oh, I'm on fire  Soon I've sighted somewhere in life  Ah  Sitch back 
[02:10:30]  Without the road too  Ah  Mmm  Neither will we get up in the right  Turned for the shot  Need  See if I won't die  Ooh, what am I saying?  Ooh, what am I saying?  Ooh, what am I saying? 
[02:11:00]  Sirius XM 
[02:11:30]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  We got Stephen Van Zandt coming in studio in a few minutes.  Tomorrow, JWoww and Snooki.  Snooki has finally decided to do our show, huh?  Yes.  They have a show they're promoting together, I guess. 
[02:12:00]  A little spin-off.  Jersey Shore spin-off.  And Daryl Hammett in his studio next week.  I got his book that Jimmy's raving about.  It's called God, If You're Not Up There, I'm Fucked.  So, we'll talk to Daryl Hammett next week.  What were you going to say, Jimmy?  I've been listening to a lot of Ramones lately.  Why?  Just fucking...  I slept on that band for years.  I never hated them.  I never disliked them.  I just didn't listen to them.  And I just watched a documentary recently,  and I'm starting to just...  I just fucking... 
[02:12:30]  It's all I've been listening to.  Is the documentary out?  Yeah, it's been out since 2002.  Oh.  I don't know.  We're a happy family.  Phenomenal.  I'm not a big Ramones guy.  Nah.  No?  I can't front and make believe.  Yeah, I liked some of their stuff,  played some of their stuff on the radio over the years,  but I don't really go that deep with them.  They're just...  They're fucking simple, but good.  Yeah, this is great.  It's all I've been listening to. 
[02:13:00]  It's just a fucking toe tap for every one.  You want a pogo?  Let's pogo.  You like this?  Fucking fantastic.  Ramones there?  Eh, not really.  Not so much?  I wouldn't say, like, ugh, I hate it, 
[02:13:30]  but really, like...  I had a friend growing up.  Loved him.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking loved him.  Everyone had that friend growing up.  I didn't hate him.  Yeah.  Just, I mean,  I'm going to piss off a lot of people,  but it just sounded very...  Every song sounded pretty much the same to me.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Pinhead's a good one, too.  I don't want to be a pinhead no more.  That one. 
[02:14:00]  Christmas got the same.  Daddy likes men.  Fucking great.  Daddy likes men.  It's just weird.  They were just weird guys.  Fucking...  People love them.  Yeah.  People fucking love them.  They're real original.  They've been ripped off a lot of scenes.  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear...  Someone said I want to hear Motorhead cover the song,  and I agree.  Metallica did a cover of the song,  which I didn't love.  Somebody turned me on to a  Foo Fighters slash Zeppelin mashup yesterday. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  At Wemblee.  Wemblee.  I guess the Foo Fighters were playing in Wemblee.  Wemblee.  And they got Jimmy Page and John Paul to come out,  and they did Ramble On.  Ramble On!  Yeah, I heard that.  I saw the video.  It's a tough song to sing.  Well, of course it is.  It's very hard.  Grohl did all right.  Well, he was doing his Screamy Grohl voice.  I love Dave Grohl.  I really do.  I love the Foo Fighters,  but you can't praise him for the performance.  It was brave to even attempt the song. 
[02:15:00]  He did all right.  Yeah.  The fact is, Robert Plant can't even come close  to singing that song anymore.  No, no, no.  Those days are over.  But it is kind of weird.  When he started it, I'm listening,  and there's no way he can hit it.  You saw this?  Yeah.  Yeah, I definitely checked it out.  Whoa.  What's going on there?  No, that's a shitty version.  This is a shitty version.  Let me see what I'm doing. 
[02:15:30]  Now, you got it.  There's an HD,  because I think they filmed it for a DVD or something.  There's an HD version.  It looks amazing.  Looks like they got, like, helicopter shots from above.  Yeah, look at this.  Look at how great this looks.  Ah, we'll do this later.  Steven Van Zand is entering the studio.  Hey, come, bring him in.  What's up, Steven?  Hey, hey, hey.  What's going on, man?  Hey, Ben. 
[02:16:00]  It's about time.  Hey, Ben.  First time.  Yeah, yeah.  Our paths have crossed a million times.  We've never met you officially.  Steven Van Zand.  I thought we had at some point.  I don't think you had.  You never did our show, huh?  I don't think so.  Yeah, I don't think so either.  We would remember if Steven Van Zand did our show.  That's true.  I met Steven once in the street, in the village.  I was standing outside the comedy cell,  and there's a guy I know who works for TMZ.  He goes, I'm going to get Steven Van Zand real quick.  You want to get a picture?  So I just went, and we took a picture outside.  Really?  Yeah, you were very nice. 
[02:16:30]  Fascinating.  That was an amazing story, Jimmy.  But I'm the only one with a Steven Van Zand story.  None of the other big shots in the room have a sill story.  I wish I had a story like that.  You're right.  That's true.  I'm always amazed when the TMZ guys are after me.  I'm like, can you find a real celebrity?  I mean, really.  It's a slow celebrity day.  They're after me.  You're pretty good.  You're downplaying it, sir.  You've done all right for yourself.  Really?  Man.  With Bruce, obviously, for many, many years.  And you're out on the road again?  You're going out?  Going out on the road. 
[02:17:00]  And I got a new TV show, which is really kind of exciting.  Yeah, this Lilyhammer is going to be on Netflix.  You know, the very first original programming for Netflix.  That's where a lot of this stuff's going.  Jimmy's talking about this.  Netflix is going to start acting like a real network.  And they got a lot of their people back, too.  It's a good time to be going on, because they got, like, all the subs they lost, they've gotten most back.  Which is great.  Yeah.  What's the show about?  The show, I'm playing a gangster again.  It works.  It works for you.  It goes in a witness protection program in Norway. 
[02:17:30]  And it was a show done for Norwegian television.  So it's really quirky.  It's kind of a funny.  It's not a comedy outright.  It's like what we call a dramedy now.  But the humor comes from the circumstance and the characters and a bunch of great actors over there.  But it's in Norwegian, except for me.  The premise is my character understands Norwegian but doesn't speak it.  Right.  So I speak English throughout.  And the rest of it's subtitle, which is really a bizarre thing for Netflix to pick as their first original program. 
[02:18:00]  I give them all the credit in the world, man.  Because they said, you know what?  This show is just cool.  Yeah.  And it works.  And, you know.  And they're a little bit more sophisticated than most.  They just, you know.  They just dig.  When something's artistically right, they go with it, you know.  Has it been hard to get acting work since The Sopranos?  Is it like typecasting?  Or have you not really looked?  Well, I haven't looked, you know.  And I certainly didn't plan on playing a gangster again.  But this writing team came to me, his husband and wife, and said, you know, gangster, witness protection, lily hammer, Norway.  I said, you know what?  That's so crazy, it sounds like fun. 
[02:18:30]  Might as well do it, right?  Yeah, might as well do it.  So, you know, it turned out to be really good.  We did eight episodes.  And they'll all be up February 6th on Netflix.  These days, you know, I said to them, you know, we worked a year and a half on this.  And it all goes up on one day.  You know?  I'm like, can't we spread it out a little bit?  Yeah, right.  Just give them a little bit at a time?  That's the new world, you know?  Yeah.  People want it right away.  Yeah, they're taping shows, even.  We've talked about it a lot on our show.  It's tough to have to wait a week for the next episode. 
[02:19:00]  Really tough.  Nobody waits anymore.  No.  They'll either tape them and then watch them.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Or this new Netflix thing, which is just put them all up at once.  Yeah, absolutely.  I like it that way.  Do your own little marathon.  That's one more knife in televisions back is the fact that now Netflix is going to do it.  Cable's in trouble, man, and so is regular TV.  If Netflix starts fucking getting original programming.  Especially on demand when you want it.  Exactly.  That's what it's all about.  I don't want to wait anymore.  Yeah.  I remember the old days when I saw Planet of the Apes in the movie theater in 1968 when I was a little tater tot. 
[02:19:30]  And then I was like, I left the movie theater and went, I'm never going to see that movie again.  Because, you know, you had to wait until it was on Channel 5 in New York, and it took years, you know?  Well, how did you feel when it came out on DVD?  You're like, wait a minute.  Now I can see whatever I want.  And then I don't watch it.  The future.  But then I don't watch it.  I don't know.  That's true.  I don't know what the hell will be on.  Are you a little higher echelon in organized crime in this one?  Well, yeah.  No, in real life, we're asking. 
[02:20:00]  I've stretched from Consigliani to underboss, and he was supposed to be the boss, right?  And they put the wrong guy in, and the guy tries to whack him, which surprises him because he gets along with everybody, you know?  He's one of those guys.  He's more outgoing than Silvio in Sopranos.  You know, he's more of a boss type, you know?  Yeah.  And he's just so shocked that they tried to kill him that he doesn't want to go to Utah or Arizona.  He's like, I'll take Norway.  You know, get me out of here.  Oh, really?  Get the hell out of there.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then he immediately goes into denial about the whole thing and just starts making moves on Norway. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, right.  So it's kind of...  It's kind of like Sammy the Bull.  He sounds like Gravano.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Only more so.  Face like Gravano, Lord, because the Norwegian culture is quite different.  I mean, they really are.  They're very straight.  They're very conservative, you know?  There's no crime, really.  You shot it there?  Yeah.  Oh, how was that?  Six months through the trip.  What did you like about it?  I got into it, man.  You got to get into, like, cold weather.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah.  Like, 10 below, 20 below.  Were you skating on the rivers?  Outside.  You're outside a lot.  That's crazy.  You know? 
[02:21:00]  All locations.  And you have to get into that snow thing, you know?  They're just different.  I mean, but you're shocked by how the infrastructure holds up compared to us.  You know, it shows you how bad our country, what kind of shape we're in.  You know?  We get three inches of snow.  We lose Connecticut for two weeks.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  They got six feet of snow.  Okay?  Airport never closes.  No cars on the side of the road.  No power outages.  Right?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Six feet of snow.  They just keep living.  Yeah.  That's just normal life for them. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's the regular day.  But they're tougher people than we are.  Yeah.  You have to be, right?  They're tough.  You have to be.  Oh, yeah?  So you have to, like, man up over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they don't have, like, celebrities.  They're not big on...  I mean, they're very nice to me, you know?  But they're not...  They don't cater to celebrities.  You know what I mean?  It's not like here.  It's royalty.  Yeah.  No.  No.  There's no...  Did they know you there?  And if they did, was it from The Sopranos or from Bruce?  You know, both things are big there, actually.  We broke the record with the E Street Band last tour, and I think Sopranos DVDs are, per 
[02:22:00]  capita, the biggest sales.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It's quite a bit.  Yeah.  How did you get into acting, anyway?  Because you wound up being pretty good.  Oh, Jimmy.  You should have known when I said you wound up being pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  I really just stink.  David Chase saw me inducting the Rascals at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and...  That was it?  He wanted some new phases.  And he was able to see that character in you.  I don't know.  Wow.  That is something, man. 
[02:22:30]  He's something else.  He really is.  Yeah.  Did you have any reservations about taking the role?  Originally?  And thinking, ah, I'm just going to make an ass of myself or something?  Well, you know what worried me, honestly?  Because we're so used to controlling our own destiny in rock and roll, you know?  I was worried.  I thought, well, this first script is really good, right?  But what if the next one isn't?  Now you're in it.  I'm like, uh-oh.  I really got nervous about that.  I figured I'll just walk away.  Fuck it.  You didn't want to ruin your reputation with the band. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  Because you do have a certain reputation with the E Street Band.  And then, you know, if all of a sudden they had you as Johnny Cakes guy...  Yeah.  Exactly.  If you were written into that part...  I had to make a concern.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They would have killed you.  They would have killed them.  You put your finger right there.  Yeah, yeah.  They'd figure that shit out.  But that was...  What a great run for The Sopranos. 
[02:23:30]  Ten years.  And for you to...  Ten years.  Yeah.  Seven seasons in ten years.  An integral character in that.  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you had one of the standout scenes in that, too.  When you drove...  Oh, what's-her-name into the woods there?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, that to me was one of the most unbelievable, horrific scenes in that show.  Yeah, it was tough.  Because you had done some shenanigans and hijinks prior in the series.  Anyways, but that puts you over the top as just being heartless and the real villain 
[02:24:00]  that we knew Sylvia was.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was no turning around from that one.  It was true.  And David Chase was brilliant about that stuff, about not romanticizing it.  Right, right.  He really, you know...  If you wanted to be in a mob watching that show, there's something really wrong with you.  What'd you say to him?  Get out of the car, you fucking cunt.  There was no flowery speech.  No, no, that was it.  I worked hard on that line. 
[02:24:30]  It's a lot of Jimmy's dates, Andy.  Exactly.  And they're saying it to me.  What was it like on the set after someone...  Because she had been all...  That was the end of the fifth season, I think.  And how is it when you know she's not coming back and she's been a big part of the show?  What happens after that scene is wrapped?  That's the hardest thing, you know?  It was very hard with Vinnie Pastore when he went.  Because, you know, you don't see people you don't work with. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, I don't.  Right, that's true, yeah.  You know what I mean?  You know, you're working all the time.  I don't socialize that much.  So, you know, you're not going to see him again.  Literally, you know?  And it's quite depressing at the moment.  So it fits in with what's going on on screen also.  But personally, you feel like, eh, I'm going to miss him.  Yeah, it is one of those things.  We've had those experiences in the shithole of entertainment that is radio.  Where you're doing a gig.  And, you know, you leave the station. 
[02:25:30]  You're like, yeah, take it easy.  I'll get you a number.  We'll get together and stuff.  Boom.  Never again.  Goodbye.  Do you see these people?  We have to reintroduce ourselves every morning.  We literally, you wipe the slate clean as soon as your ass...  It's healthier that way, though.  It's so much healthier.  Yeah, I got to ask the hack question.  Tony, does he die at the end there?  Well, there's no...  What's your interpretation?  I know David Chase hasn't really helped us out.  Nah, I mean, as I tell people, you know, what happened was the director yelled, cut, and 
[02:26:00]  the actors went home.  That's what happened, you know?  What's your thought, being so close?  I think the idea with the camera sort of swoops in, captures this little piece of life,  and then the camera moves on, and it goes on, you know, you can interpret it any way  you want to, but, you know, when you ask people, what would you have liked to have happened?  You know, you want to see the family wiped out?  Well, no.  Right.  You want to see Tony killed?  No.  You want to see the kids killed?  No.  Well, what's your ending? 
[02:26:30]  You know what I mean?  What's a better ending?  Well...  You know, nobody can really come up with it.  They sure made it dramatic with Meadow not being able to park, though.  Well, dramatic is this.  But it was over-the-top dramatic, like, holy shit, get inside there already.  And then it just ends.  Yeah, it was shocking.  I like the ending now.  It was shocking.  I thought it was brilliant, honestly.  At first, I hated it.  In hindsight, it really was great.  But now that you sit with it a while, you're like, yeah, right on, man.  I kind of liked that.  Yeah.  It was definitely different.  How far in advance would you know, like, I'll mention the Adriana killing scene. 
[02:27:00]  How far in advance did you know this is what we're doing?  Would they actually literally, would you get the script weeks in advance, or would that  piece be hidden until day of?  You get, you'd only get a script maybe the week before.  But if you're going to be killed, David would have that talk a few weeks earlier.  It's your turn.  Yeah.  A few weeks earlier.  You might want to...  We joke about it.  You know, when David asks you to lunch, it's not a good thing.  Oh, really?  You might not want to buy that car.  You might not want to... 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, shit.  I just found a house.  Great to lease.  I don't know if you want to buy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Pretty, yeah.  Pretty close to airtime.  You get that information in print.  Yeah.  Well, Vincent Pastore came back a lot, at least.  I mean, he's like the most lived-on, killed character ever.  Yeah, true.  Because at least he was back in all those weird flashbacks and all those ghost things and  with the talking fish.  I mean, so he kind of stayed alive in the series, at least, as an actor.  Yeah, that's true.  But it's got to suck to realize you're in episode two and then episode 11, you know, 
[02:28:00]  when you were a regular for the first two years.  How did you swing the band and the show at the same time?  You must have been working your ass off.  Starting with the second season, I was doing both.  Yeah.  And David was nice enough to put my scenes on the days off of the tour.  He didn't turn to you and go, oh, you know, if you want to play with your little rock and  roll band, you know, we've got some important stuff going on here, too, Stephen.  Just downplay.  Yeah, totally downplay Bruce. 
[02:28:30]  How long do you think that could possibly last?  I'm not going to say he was thrilled about it.  But it was wonderful that he would do that, because, you know, he was a music fan, obviously.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, he was touring between the two, being happy for me at the same time, you know.  Yeah, painting the ass.  He says, you know, I just gave him a new career, and, you know, he's walking out on me already.  But that had to be exhausting, though.  You're flying in just to do your scenes and back on tour with Bruce.  And I mean, from L.A., from France.  Oh, my God.  For what?  Just a day, two days? 
[02:29:00]  One day.  One day.  You come in, you say, fuck you, and you get back on the plane.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  We need you for a quick fuck you.  Yeah.  Was it easy to get back into character doing it that way?  After being on a plane that long and coming out and having to say fuck you?  Oh, yeah, sure.  He probably meant that.  It's probably the first thing he said off the plane.  Fuck you.  Wait, the cameras aren't rolling.  David Chase is right there at the airport.  Yeah.  Wow.  Damn, man.  So it was a couple of years of doing both, you know.  That's exciting.  I mean, it ended up, I think it limited what my character was written. 
[02:29:30]  You know, I couldn't get into plot lines that deeply because they were always nervous that  I wouldn't show up.  Wouldn't be able to make it.  Didn't you have them create that character because they wanted to give you another character  and be like, I don't want to take that from an actor, so.  Yeah, that's true.  I started feeling guilty about taking an actor's job.  I said, you know, these guys work their whole lives.  They do, you know, all these schools and off-Broadway, whatever.  And, you know, there's a guitar player coming off the street.  You know, I don't want to take a guy's job. 
[02:30:00]  So he wrote me in the part, yeah.  Wow, damn.  No, we have a guy.  Roland should be in here because we have.  Oh, yeah.  Roland is.  You know, the guy that walked you down.  Definitive Bruce fan.  Yeah.  He's kind of creepy and weird and he probably mumbled a little bit.  I think he's seen more of your shows than anyone I know.  Yeah, we haven't found anyone that has went to more Springsteen shows than Roland.  Maybe you would know the answer to it.  I don't know.  Roland, how many?  Look at him.  He's wearing the shirt.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, Roland.  Roland.  You're embarrassing everybody.  Don't take any shit, Roland.  I love you, Taylor.  I love you.  That's right.  Good one.  How many Springsteen shows?  How many Springsteen shows?  250.  250.  Is that up there?  That's more than I did.  Wow.  That's got to be right up there, right?  I think so.  I don't take polls that often, but he goes to rehearsals and everything.  He'll go to all the rehearsals.  Saw you guys in Stockholm, too, for the last tour. 
[02:31:00]  It was awesome.  It's fun over there, right?  Oh, yeah.  I tell people if you can get over to Europe, it's a crazy audience.  Yeah.  And, Stephen, all he wants is a picture with Bruce.  Well, that's all.  But let me tell you what happened.  Bruce came in and did a special thing for the company, and Roland was not allowed to  get a picture that day.  It's killing him.  It had nothing to do with Bruce, by the way.  It had something to do with the company.  Nah, it's the company.  It had nothing to do with Bruce.  Bruce certainly would have taken the picture with Roland.  My soul cried for a month, that's all. 
[02:31:30]  He was that close to finally getting the picture, and he wasn't allowed to.  Give me a call.  Give me a call.  Yeah, see that?  I can override that.  You think?  Don't worry about it.  You know where a good way to get Bruce's picture is?  On the elevator in Minneapolis, when he's running up from the workout.  Follow him onto the elevator.  That worked well for me.  You creep.  Couldn't have been fucking creepier.  Oh, God.  Couldn't have been creepier.  We walked by him, and then we doubled back and got on the elevator.  Oh, hi.  What a funny.  Couldn't have been.  So obvious, right?  He's got to be one of the most well-known faces in the world. 
[02:32:00]  Like, he really, I mean, and you've been with him.  What is it like to have that type of fame where you really can't even go around?  Jimmy, shut up.  Jimmy, who's going to pull his well, Anthony?  I want to know.  Whatever.  You want to ask the guest?  I understand.  Fair enough.  It's a pain in the ass.  It can't be.  Really, to be that big, I mean, you know, I've always had this nice, comfortable, low-level  of celebrity. 
[02:32:30]  So, you know, people say hello.  You know, you get into any restaurant.  Yeah, yeah.  It's nice.  You have just enough where you get all the perks without a lot of the bullshit that goes  along with it.  Exactly.  The paparazzi not interested in me whatsoever.  However, it's nice, you know, so I don't know how he does it.  No, but the guy from TMZ, I don't even know what he asked you.  It was a nice conversation, though.  He wasn't trying to nail you or anything.  No, I'm always nice to those people.  They've got to make a living, you know.  So, I mean, I'm always surprised that they want to talk to me.  I'm like, I got no gossip for you. 
[02:33:00]  What do you want from me?  I'm so boring.  I am so boring.  It probably makes it harder to come after you, though, because there's nothing, there's  no dirt to get.  No.  I mean, you know, but I mean, I don't know.  As long as they mention Lily Hammer, I'll be fine.  There you go.  Yeah.  What do you do between, I know you're busy and stuff, but any kind of downtime you get,  what do you like to do?  Up until recently, there's really been no downtime.  I had a management company, a record company, you know, I got two stations on Sirius XM,  you know.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  We got two.  Which ones?  From the beginning, yeah, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  The rock and roll stations, Underground Garage, 21, and Outlaw Country on 60.  Oh, I didn't know about Outlaw Country.  I didn't know about that one.  Yeah, they're my stations, yeah.  Oh, you built that one?  Yeah.  That was your idea?  Yeah.  Outlaw Country is really good.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not too much.  My two formats.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  So, you know, that's obviously a lot of work, but then I have a syndicated, my radio show  is syndicated, which is not on my station.  Right, right.  Yeah.  It started off as a syndicated show, my two-hour show, and then I had 3,000 songs picked, and I  played 26, you know? 
[02:34:00]  So I said, you know, this is a format, and Scott Greenstein was a consultant at that  time.  Right.  And he said, you know, this is a serious thing.  What are we going to do with it?  You know, so I said, I got a couple ideas.  Yeah, so we started together, really, and I really brought the first original content,  you know, the first original formats of here.  Mm-hmm.  I know.  So that took up a lot of time, you know, while I was getting going, and then, so, you  know, and then filming and doing this and that, so I really don't have any downtime,  per se, you know? 
[02:34:30]  So now I'm trying to slow down that stuff and just concentrate more on my career, so to  speak, which I always ignore, to be honest.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, it's the last thing I think about.  You know what I mean?  So, you know.  It seems to have worked out that way.  Well, you know what happens?  No matter how much you plan, the biggest things that have ever happened to me are just not  planned.  It just happened, right?  Really.  Just happened.  If David Chase sees me on inducting the rascals, he calls me, right?  His husband and wife, creative team, get me for Lilyhammer, Bruce calls me to be in 
[02:35:00]  the band, you know.  You know, meanwhile, you're working really hard to do this over here, and you never even  get to it.  Yeah, yeah.  Roland, how did...  That's how life is.  How did Stephen Van Zank get together with Bruce?  What's the story?  Um...  He knows everything.  I know, but I just might doubt.  I know that...  He's so nervous.  Come on, he's right here.  He's so nervous.  Roland.  How did he...  Oh, man.  He knows everything.  How did he meet and get a hook of a Bruce, please?  Tell us the story.  I know he's 16 years old.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  And then Bobby G was wrote in about them, about Stevie Levy, the band, in 84.  Yeah.  But I forgot how they met.  Somewhere in Asbury Park, though.  Somewhere in Asbury Park?  Even I know that.  Close enough.  Oh, God damn, Roland.  You're a disaster.  What's the matter with you?  How did he...  We want to know how he got hooked up with Bruce.  It's an easy question.  You're supposed to show him that you're a big fan.  He's going to hook you up with Bruce to get a picture, but you've got to prove you're  a real fan.  Right now, you sound like just a guy who listened to Springsteen once on the radio, 
[02:36:00]  but he was cute.  Wikipedia five minutes ago.  You look like you heard Born in the fucking USA on your iPod, and now you want to talk  to Steve.  Well...  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Oh, we love this, though.  He's cracking under the pressure.  He really is.  He's panicking.  He really is panicking.  He's humiliating all of us.  That's why we did it.  It's his last day of work here, hopefully.  How many shows are you planning on seeing with the new tour?  As many as possible.  I'd probably see all the East Coast tours.  Or the New York, New Jersey... 
[02:36:30]  How many days in New York?  The two shows at MSG, and then there's two at IZOT and one in Prudential.  Nice.  Five shows?  First leg.  Look at him.  He does know.  I didn't know.  Steve is just like, yeah, they call me whenever my phone rings.  You need to know anything, he'll tell you the answer.  Except how you met Bruce.  He has no idea how that happened.  My mind blanked.  And my head is like, Bruce.  And then nothing.  How do you keep it exciting on stage from playing a lot of the same songs? 
[02:37:00]  You know what?  First of all, right from the beginning, we decided to not have a set like most people  do.  We change the songs every single night, which is unusual to begin with.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you what makes it exciting is Bruce, you know, I've known him my whole  life, and he's still impressing me.  Maid dropper.  Honest to God, he still impresses me.  You know, he's got a new record.  And we all, well, I think every time we go out, we've probably had a new record, I think. 
[02:37:30]  Maybe Roland could tell us later.  Yeah, Roland.  But, you know, you're not going out as a nostalgia act, in other words, which I could see becoming  really a bore.  Right.  And we've just never done that.  I mean, Bruce's writing is vital.  You know, he's like he's 16 years old.  I mean, you know, he's 21 years old.  That's an old school way to do things, though.  Before you tour, you put out a new album.  And that's what bands used to do.  But then there's token records you put out and records that really are high quality. 
[02:38:00]  And that's what this guy has never stopped writing like it matters.  You know what I mean?  And I love that.  I mean, it's really honest to God.  It impresses me, and I've known him forever, that he could still maintain that level of  enthusiasm and quality.  And, you know, he doesn't have to at this point.  You know what I mean?  Who, at that stage of the game, you know.  Right.  That's interesting.  You said that, too.  It doesn't go out as a nostalgia act.  It's always doing new shit.  So for the band, it's exciting to go on stage and play the new stuff.  That's it.  There are some bands that can do that.  Yeah.  And others that just, they're nostalgia acts. 
[02:38:30]  Well, I think if you do it early enough, your audience adapts to what you're doing.  We have the greatest audience in the world.  We really do.  I mean, they accept the new stuff every single time.  You know.  There's an audience right there.  Is that great?  Especially when the album shows was the best.  Which one?  The album shows.  Oh, the whole album.  Don't try to understand.  Who started the album show concept?  Was it you guys?  Because now everyone's doing it.  Maybe.  Yeah.  You guys first started, then everybody started copying.  Maybe.  You two started to do it, I think.  I know Steely Dan did it. 
[02:39:00]  Kiss did it once.  Kiss did it.  They did a different album every night.  What a great idea, though.  You do the whole album, and then you got your encore to play some other stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a cool idea.  To bring it all together.  You know what my favorite Springsteen song is?  It's a weird one.  It's Youngstown.  That's my favorite one.  Yeah?  Why?  It's a good one.  It just is.  I don't know why.  It just hits me.  Yeah.  They've made bullets and stuff and bombs.  Youngstown.  Who sings about Youngstown, Ohio?  That's the beauty of it.  That's the beauty of it.  Nobody's ever thought to sing about that shithole, and he wrote an amazing song about it. 
[02:39:30]  Did he ever see Youngstown, though?  No.  Oh, he might have.  I know.  He might have.  He might have.  I don't know what.  Bruce will get around to the whole country eventually.  Every city.  But it makes it interesting.  But you know what?  And that is the genius of Bruce.  And I saw the same thing actually happen with David Chase, where they take these little  small stories, you know, that you would think no one's interested in, right?  You know?  And these little details in that small story, you know?  And those end up becoming universal, you know?  That somehow there's a universal truth in that little story, that little town, you know, 
[02:40:00]  that nobody would write about, you know?  And I saw it happen twice with those guys.  And I actually, as we were writing Lilyhammer, I kept that in mind, actually.  I said to them, because I knew it was going to be the first Norwegian show that could possibly  travel, because, you know, you never see something from Norway, you know?  No.  The whole country's a big mystery to everybody, which is going to make the show more fun.  But, and I said to the other writers, you know, I became one of the writers with them,  and I said, let's make sure it's as Norwegian as possible. 
[02:40:30]  Okay, don't make it diluted to be more international.  Let's make it more Norwegian, you know?  Right.  Because I watch it happen.  Mm-hmm.  With Bruce and with David Chase, you know?  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  The more particular and eccentric it is, somehow, the more universal it becomes.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know why.  Because it looks different.  It looks different than everything everybody's used to.  Yeah.  You know, you don't, and this show in particular, you don't know where it's going.  You can't, you can't predict where this show's going.  I mean, because, you know.  And the nice thing about speaking English in a subtitled show, which is just an experiment,  really, you know, it's different than a typically subtitled show, because you get sucked 
[02:41:00]  in, because you become that character more readily, because you speak English.  Right.  You know?  How hard is it for you to act with other people within the show when they are speaking another  language?  It's tricky.  It's tricky.  If I wasn't one of the writers, it would have been really hard.  Oh, okay.  So you know what they're saying, but.  I know what I think they're saying.  Just based on you.  They're probably saying, look at this fucking asshole.  Jesus.  They call this guy a prick in every single show.  Yeah.  He just says, yes, I am. 
[02:41:30]  They just shit on his guitar playing, but he doesn't have a guitar.  It's so weird.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  That would be bad.  That would be bad.  That joke's on you.  A whole fucking show.  Lily Hammer was at the Winter Olympics, right?  Was there.  Yes, that's what the premise is.  The guy was watching the 94 Olympics and he fell in love with it, you know, and then  he realizes when he gets over there, he hates the cold, he hates the snow.  You're like, what the fuck am I doing over here?  But it was a cute idea.  It really was.  And it works. 
[02:42:00]  It really works.  That's nice to see it on Netflix, too.  Is that the first piece of original programming?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is really, you know, I'm so impressed by that.  I'm not kidding.  You know, to do that as your first show is like, it's like a real quirky.  Weird show, you know?  Right.  And they were like, we're down.  We love this, you know?  Now, did they, a technical question, but did they actually produce and finance it or did  they say, just bring us a finished product?  In this case, it had already been being produced.  Oh, okay.  It was already being produced, yeah.  So, they came in as a, you know, an after production, you know, partner. 
[02:42:30]  But that's good, though, because you don't have, when you have that, you don't have to  bounce it off anybody's standards and practices.  You don't have to go through anybody.  That's true.  Just whatever you want to do, you do.  And I got spoiled from all those years at HBO who were the great, they really are the  gold standard, you know?  And they hire people and they let them do the job.  You know?  They're not bugging them every day with notes and all that bullshit you get.  You hear the nightmares of networks where it's just people twisting your idea around 
[02:43:00]  until it doesn't even resemble.  And diluting, diluting, diluting until it becomes bullshit, you know?  And you wonder why these things don't work.  Yeah.  Where the Sopranos was one guy's vision.  You're seeing, that's David Chase right there.  Yeah.  When they shot Lorraine Bracco and James Gandolfini, did they ever shoot them separately?  Because a lot of times it looks like you don't ever see them in the frame together.  They just go from Tony to Dr. Melfi and back to Tony.  Or they actually always were there together?  No, they were always there.  This group of actors was a remarkable group of actors. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, they just, you know, helped each other and were supportive of each other.  You hear about stories where that's not true.  The most famous one is On the Waterfront, Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger, you know?  And Rod Steiger talked for years about that prick, Marlon Brando, who didn't stay for my close-up,  you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And Brando just didn't respect him.  That's one of the great scenes of all time.  You would never know it, you know?  But, you know, when Rod Steiger's talking, Marlon Brando is not there.  It's not even there.  Oh, shit, yeah.  But anyway, no, we didn't do that.  I mean, we were always very supportive. 
[02:44:00]  And this group of actors was in Norway amazing.  I mean, you know, they support the arts in Norway, unlike us.  You know, they have a national theater, and these guys were, like, fantastic actors.  So, you know, they got, like, Laurence Olivier of Norway playing a cab driver.  You know what I mean?  It's really freaky.  It's just kind of cool.  So what's the process here?  You go through the, you'll show the eight, and will Netflix make the decision on whether  to shoot more, or will you guys make the decision?  Yeah, we'll see.  We're going to talk about it and see, you know?  I've got this little tour that's going to be a little bit of an interruption here. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, a little, little tour.  We'll see how long that goes.  But, you know, we'll see if people like it.  You know what I mean?  If people like it, we'll certainly look at continuing.  After all these years of playing, how is it behind the scenes, in between gigs, are you  guys still, you know, or have you ever been, like, crazy party guys with this band?  Early.  Early on.  Early on?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mostly me and Clarence.  Oh, really?  To be honest. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Well, of course, we're going to miss forever.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  No doubt.  But, no, ever since, it became, you know, it became pretty...  The guys are pretty civil now.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's the whole business is more civilized because once you start doing three-hour shows,  you can't, you can only do so many drugs.  There's not enough drugs and booze in the world to keep you upright for three hours, you know?  You just can't do it.  You've got to straighten out.  How was it at the Super Bowl?  You know, that was a trip. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  I've got to say, you know, I've done a lot of things.  Yeah.  That was a trip.  I just wanted to see them assemble at a stage, man.  You know?  Yeah.  I've got to see how they do this, right?  And, I mean, it was amazing.  50 different little pieces of the stage come running out from all those.  And everything worked.  Yeah.  It had to work.  It works every time, every year.  I mean, it's incredible how they got...  But you're there all week rehearsing.  Right.  They don't fool around.  They're like, we want you there all week.  Cracking the whip, yeah.  They're like, we don't rehearse a week for a tour. 
[02:46:00]  For three songs.  We're going to be there for a week?  But, you know, they were very serious about it.  What was the audience that saw you?  Well, the size?  Yeah.  It's like a billion.  It was like a...  How's that?  That's amazing.  How's that knowing that there's a billion eyes on you?  You don't want to focus on that too much.  Not during it.  We had...  Wow.  And I think it was the first time that they allowed the audience to come up to the front  of the stage.  Okay?  Which I think was one reason why all those years, because we had been asked before. 
[02:46:30]  And we held out until, I think, you know, we said, you know, we need the audience right  there.  You know?  So you're looking at two, three thousand people, you know, like a regular gig, you know, right  up against the stage.  And you focus on them, you know?  So you see them, you know, make an eye contact with them.  And that's who you're playing to.  You don't look at the 80,000 in the...  In the arena.  In the billion.  In the billion.  In the one camera.  And then they've got to get the 3,000 people off the field and the stage to get the second  half going.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Really.  Like clockwork. 
[02:47:00]  Roland, why aren't you talking about it?  They've got it so down.  They really got it down.  Yeah.  You have any Springsteen or...  Yeah.  How about a booze saying?  How about an anecdote?  Or Stevie Van Zandt questions?  Something.  Come on, man, Roland.  We're obviously missing something here.  He knows everything.  He has no questions.  Yeah, that's probably why.  He knows the whole story.  Something we should ask because...  Do you remember how they met yet?  You had plenty of time to think.  Did you Google it at least?  No.  I think they met when they played the circuit with Southside Johnny and they met through  bands.  Maybe.  Now he's on to it.  We both had bands. 
[02:47:30]  You know?  I was a leader of my band.  He was a leader of his band.  And there weren't that many bands in those days.  Believe it or not.  There's only about 10 bands in our area.  Good old Southside.  You know?  Southside was later, actually.  Was he?  Yeah, that was a little bit later.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Yeah, but he's close.  He's close.  And there was a show called Hullabaloo.  I don't know if you remember.  Hullabaloo!  We grew up with like 10 rock and roll shows on TV.  Can you imagine how great that was?  Yeah.  10 rock and roll shows every week.  Okay? 
[02:48:00]  One of them was Hullabaloo.  And they were so popular, they had clubs for a while.  And so they had three clubs in our area.  Freehold, Middletown, and Asbury Park.  Which created this sort of triangle of a circuit.  And then we had the beach clubs also right there on the coast.  So it was a great time to grow up.  We had a million places to play, you know?  But even though everybody had a band in their garage the day after the Beatles played,  Ed Sullivan, only about 10 really got out there in the circuit. 
[02:48:30]  And so we were all friends.  You knew each other, you know, from that.  And then we became friends, you know?  Geez.  Imagine that.  You could have hooked up with like one of the other 10 bands that ended up, you know,  the guys in the furniture business now.  So he's sophist.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably made more money than we did for about the first 10 years.  For the first 10 years, maybe, right?  And you caught up quickly, though, sir.  Yeah, these guys.  Hey, we up.  This guy, he ain't going anywhere.  Well, is he casting for his new Norwich show?  I just, I do a little acting myself. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  If there's any auditions to be had, I'd love to.  If you can speak Norwegian, you got a job.  Oh, no, but I want to.  I'll be like, no, no, I'll be your like American friend.  Like I did something.  Oh, could you got a little piece you could do?  I haven't thought of it.  Oh, come on.  It's cold over here.  What the fuck?  That's a good line.  It's perfect, right?  That's a good line.  But I'd probably blow up.  I'd go, oh, Jesus.  Sil, cut.  Oh, shit.  Wrong show.  I can't wait to tune in, though, and see some guy go, it's cold over here.  What the fuck? 
[02:49:30]  Stare at the TV going, he took the fucking line.  That was a good one, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  Remember that?  Very believable.  One of our regulars, CokeLogic, on Twitter, he says, do you know that Eddie Vedder loves  Underground Garage?  You must know by now, right?  Yeah, he mentioned it, and he sent me a congratulations.  We just did our 500th show.  Right.  He made a video for you.  Yeah.  That's how much he likes Underground Garage.  Wow, damn.  That's pretty cool.  You know, I got to be honest.  That's one channel I haven't checked out a lot.  I'm going to go check it out now that you've been on the show.  Yeah, the Underground Garage, we decided to do, it's the only place you can hear all 60 years 
[02:50:00]  of rock and roll, but at the same time, the coolest new stuff.  Right.  People don't realize there's a whole lot of new rock and roll bands out there.  That just doesn't have a place.  There's no place.  It's real hard to get new music out there.  You must be torn, because even though rock radio has been great to you, obviously, with  Springsteen, you must hate it, too.  Because you know there's a lot of bands that just don't have, there's no spots for them  to get exposure.  You know what?  You just adapt to what's going on, because my syndicated shows are one of the biggest 
[02:50:30]  classics.  But for many years, you didn't have that.  You didn't have Satellite Radio.  You didn't have the internet.  We were stuck with what they threw on the radio.  Well, yeah, it was tough.  You're right.  It was tough for new artists to get heard.  I mean, and still is.  Still is.  But that's why Satellite is important.  I mean, it's the only place you can hear Frank Sinatra.  We're going to hear Frank Sinatra.  You know what I mean?  Grandfather's house.  It was important for this to be, for this to exist, really.  Sirius XM is going to be where the history of music, I think, is kept. 
[02:51:00]  You know what else?  There's really no live venues anymore for live music.  Not nearly.  You're right.  The infrastructure has changed.  I mean, it's really disintegrated.  Yeah, I mean, like you were talking about years ago, there were plenty of clubs that just  had live music.  Yeah.  And it wasn't, you know, there was a PA in there and lights and, you know, it was made  for live bands.  Yeah.  That just went out of fashion.  Yeah.  It became too expensive.  I don't know.  When did you notice them starting to play the same repeated songs over and, like, I'm sure 
[02:51:30]  with you guys, you had such major hits.  Would you be annoyed that they would only play certain songs where you're happy they're  playing your stuff, but you're like, God, there's a lot of other great stuff that they're  just ignoring.  It was a slow process that started, what, late 70s, I guess, and, you know, and it just  kept getting more and more conservative.  I guess it works or else they wouldn't do it, right?  You know what I mean?  Couldn't work that great, though.  This place wouldn't be as successful as it is.  They fucked themselves in the end. 
[02:52:00]  People finally got sick of it.  You know, radio stations weren't willing to take any chances after a while.  And I said it to my, you know, I have this discussion with my own affiliates sometimes.  I'm like, you know, like a couple, Ray Davis put out a solo record a few years ago, his  first solo record, the lead singer of The Kinks.  I said, you know, you play The Kinks, you know, every hour.  This new record is terrific.  It sounds the same.  It's the same lead singer, you know, but people wouldn't play it, you know? 
[02:52:30]  What the fuck is that about?  Is that weird?  It's just, I don't know.  There's no explanation for it, you know?  You have to go, we're hearing.  But you think rock is dead?  A lot of people say that.  I'm telling you right now.  The format is dead.  I have a thing we call the coolest new song in the world every week.  I find a new band every single week.  We've introduced 500 new bands in the last 10 years.  And are you proud of that you know you were the one that pushed them forward?  We were the first ones to play the Hives and the White Stripes.  Really?  People like that, yeah.  White Stripes? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Well, there's no format for that stuff.  No.  Where does that fit in?  Yeah.  It doesn't anyone.  So we have quite a wide range of things.  Right.  We'll play Little Richard and the early Beatles tracks from their albums and the Ramones and  the Clash and the White Stripes.  I just found a new station.  I'm checking out an underground garage.  Well, that's a place you go for a mix.  If you want to go someplace else, you go someplace else.  That's a line I'm going to do in the show.  Not about the radio. 
[02:53:30]  The other place would be Outlaw Country.  Yeah, the other place is about, like, you know, I'm in hiding now, so you want to come  here?  That was an audition for the show.  Oh, right.  Lily Hammer.  I'm just being that fun.  He's auditioning for Lily Hammer on Netflix.  Squeezing in my own lines.  Lily Hammer, yeah.  Netflix, February 6th.  Steven Van Zandt.  I think.  Yes.  February 6th.  Yeah.  All eight episodes go up.  You can just watch them all.  Oh, wow.  It's so great, though.  That is what you do.  Practice your lines.  Yeah, yeah.  It'll be cool.  Last question.  Last question, Roland, before we say goodbye to Stevie Van Zandt.  I was just looking forward to the album and tour, though. 
[02:54:00]  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  Something you always wanted to know, or I don't know, something about the new record,  the tour, what, anything.  He knows it all.  I'm telling you right now.  That must be it.  One question.  Come on, Roland.  One interesting thing.  His favorite ice cream.  I don't care.  One guy right here.  Let's go.  I don't know what you're wondering.  Who's my new sponsor on my syndicated show?  Victory Motorcycles.  That's it.  Thank you for asking that.  Victory Motorcycles.  I appreciate that.  You know, they joined the Hydrock Cafe as my loyal sponsors. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  That's great.  I get friggin' Steven Singer 8,000 times a day, and you get Victory Motorcycles.  Great.  We want a beer company.  I think this show's made for beer.  My kingdom for a beer sponsor.  We're not going to let you off the hook.  One question.  Roland, go ahead.  Let her rip.  What's Victory Motorcycles' website?  What?  What's Victory Motorcycles' website?  Victory Motorcycles.  I wish you could speak.  Victory Motorcycles.  There is a really cool new bike.  Plug Steven's show, at least.  Give him a good plug, because you love him so much.  Plug at least his name.  Lily Hammer.  Lily Hammer.  February 6th on Netflix. 
[02:55:00]  That's it.  How many episodes?  Eight.  There you go.  And how many can you get at once?  All Ocho.  He thinks that's Norwegian, and you'll put him on the show.  And Underground Garage, which I just got turned on.  I'm checking that out.  That was very cool.  And Outlaw Country, which I do listen to from time to time already.  Cool.  Hey, it's about time.  We've been wanting to talk to you forever.  Steven, thanks, man.  Stevie Van Zandt, everyone.  Love it.  Thank you. </pre>
