<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony, alongside James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar introductions.  Anthony detailed a weekend gambling trip, recounting poker wins and losses, criticizing the casino's stinginess with complimentary rooms for winners, contrasting it with the more generous practices of mob-run casinos. The conversation touched upon observations about Asian gamblers and their interactions based on national origin, before shifting to casino culture and the hypocrisy surrounding anti-smoking campaigns.  A listener then called in to respond to earlier comments.  The discussion then moved to Andre Agassi's retirement speech, contrasting it with Lou Gehrig's.

The bulk of the show centered on the death of Steve Irwin. The hosts discussed the rarity of stingray fatalities compared to other seemingly more dangerous causes of death, with Norton sharing a personal experience with stingrays. They analyzed the mechanics of a stingray attack, discussed a video of Irwin's death, and speculated about negotiations with his wife regarding the footage, suggesting financial motives and a potential Discovery Channel special.  They compared Irwin's death to other causes, including drug use, alcohol consumption, and even sex with horses, satirizing politicians' focus on less significant threats.  A contest was announced, encouraging listeners to submit 30-second audio pieces about the show. A caller shared his children's reaction to Irwin's death.  The rarity of stingray fatalities and the impact of Irwin's death on Australia were further discussed.

A recurring bit involving Roland, a show employee, dominated a significant portion of the broadcast.  Roland was repeatedly challenged to pronounce "Danny Bonaduce" correctly, resulting in increasingly absurd attempts, physical punishments (with a ruler and rat trap), and audio clips played throughout the show.

Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio throughout several segments.  The hosts recounted their recent appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, discussing the interview and online posting of clips, requesting the removal of one.  A phone call with "Stalker Patty," a devoted listener, followed, detailing her experience collecting money thrown to the crowd outside the Letterman studio.

Big A and Roland attempted a news segment, with Big A struggling with words starting with "st." The news items covered Irwin's death, Tommy Lee's reaction to Pamela Anderson's wedding, a news anchor's career move, Danny Bonaduce's role in *CSI*, and Fidel Castro's health.  A phone call with Mike Rowe from *Dirty Jobs* followed, leaving Roland speechless.

The show included a "walk-over" segment outside the studio, featuring vulgar interactions with passersby, including a homeless man, a paramedic, and Australian tourists, whose reaction to Irwin's death was discussed.  The segment also touched upon Jerry Lewis' MDA telethon.

A meandering discussion about muscular dystrophy (MD) ensued, spurred by Opie's past experiences.  The conversation included insensitive jokes about MD and other disabilities. Two callers with MD participated, and the hosts recounted a disastrous photo opportunity with children with cancer. The segment promoted Bob Kelly's stand-up appearances, including a planned Steve Irwin death scene bit with Big A.  A clip of Bill Bonds reacting to a news tease was played, followed by a discussion of George Lucas' alterations to Star Wars and listener calls.

A discussion about Star Wars, focusing on the original and re-released versions, followed by listener calls and a discussion of action figures.  A phone interview with Ryan Starr from *Rockstar: Supernova* took place, detailing a plan to get Starr back on the show using a Verizon text-based promotion.  Further discussion of Star Wars and offensive commentary continued. A YouTube video of "Black Girl" by Brother Joe prompted further vulgar commentary. A 911 call about a taco dispute featuring racist language was played, followed by offensive commentary about Rosie O'Donnell's debut on *The View* and the other hosts, particularly Barbara Walters.  The hosts ended with self-referential commentary and vulgarity.

Finally, the show included a chaotic and vulgar discussion about an unnamed philanthropist, featuring rambling conversations, insults, sexual innuendo, and interruptions.  Bob Kelly appeared again as a guest, participating in a phone-in segment with callers' feedback ranging from positive to highly negative. Bob Kelly left, frustrated. The hosts continued their banter, ending the show abruptly amidst vulgar language and disagreements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dave.  James Norton.  I like yoga. 
[00:01:00]  Gert.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I needed a little more palaver.  Just a tad.  I feel like I haven't had my daily recommended dose of talaver. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  The gang is back together.  Aw.  Ant was gambling all weekend.  Yep.  Jimmy was in Dallas all weekend.  What was I doing?  I was just kind of wandering around.  Just kind of wandering.  Did you go anywhere?  I went to the U.S. Open yesterday.  Okay.  They're doing the tennis thing here in New York.  That was a lot of fun, actually. 
[00:02:00]  Got great seats.  My God.  Thank you, Will Chapman.  Ooh, using some of the people around here.  Nah, I didn't even ask.  On Friday, before we left, Will comes up.  I got U.S. Open tickets.  Can you use them?  I'm like, yeah.  Those are pretty good seats, too.  Fifteen rows up.  Center court.  Ooh.  I'm not a huge tennis fan, but it was a lot of fun to check out.  That's for sure. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, something to do.  Absolutely.  How was the gambling?  Oh, it was great.  First night, just playing poker.  A little hold'em.  Just doing like a little 2-5 hold'em.  No limit.  So, you're not going to get rich doing it, but it turned like $500.  It was a cash game, so 500 bucks.  Turned it into like about $1,500 over the course of the 10 hours of sitting there. 
[00:03:00]  Just for fun, you know.  I like playing poker.  That's just for bragging rights.  Doing, yeah, you know something, though?  Doing really well, well-disciplined, playing some, I mean, TV poker.  That's what I was playing.  And then I just noticed, you know, cocktail, cocktails.  I'm like, you know, let me have a Heineken.  I'll just have a Heineken or something or this.  Give me a bud.  Give me one just to relax me a little bit. 
[00:03:30]  I've been here for 10 hours.  I've been drinking club soda and stuff.  Let me just, you know, it's late.  I'm like, I'm just going to have a couple of beers to feel good, you know.  Sons of bitches have it figured out in the casino.  You know what?  It's not even, dude, not even hammered or anything.  Right.  But your judgment gets just a bit clouded enough.  Can I add to that, too?  As the night goes on, the cocktail waitresses, their skirts get shorter and shorter.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  At first, maybe you're like, ah, nah, that's all right.  I'm just going to play a few hands.  And I'm convinced they go in the back and they make them put on shorter and shorter skirts.  And for the Hold'em games, the house isn't even really making a lot of money.  You know, they're just there to make sure people come in.  And they get their cut, believe me, but it's nothing like they make on the table games upstairs.  So, you know, I just figured I'd have a couple of beers.  And, man, it just does enough to you where you're like, I'll play that hand. 
[00:04:30]  Screw it.  Meanwhile, you know, you might fold ten hands in a row.  You've got to be really disciplined, you know.  And I'm just bam, bam.  And then, ah, it's like screwing up.  Just making mistakes.  And I wound up doing an all-in.  I had an ace-ten suited.  Guy against me had an ace-nine unsuited.  And right on the river, last card out, boom, a nine comes out.  So he gets the win. 
[00:05:00]  Ace-ten suited means two aces, aced in a ten same suit.  Yeah, it was diamonds.  Ace-ten diamonds.  So, you know, you get the flush opportunity there.  What's the river thing mean?  Oh, that's the last card out of the five that comes up on the table.  The community cards that come out.  It's the last card.  So I won.  I was winning right up until that last card.  Then you're like, die.  Is the river all of them or just one?  The river's the last card.  What's the other one's called?  There's the flop, which is the first three.  And then there's the turn, which is the fourth card. 
[00:05:30]  And then the river card.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I did great, though.  Then the next night I went down.  I was going to play in a tournament.  And they were so busy.  It was unbelievable.  The place was packed.  So I couldn't even get it on a table.  And they got hundreds of tables down there.  Gambling is alive and well in America.  Alive and well in America.  So I went upstairs.  Me and my chick played some three-card poker and couldn't lose.  And that's usually the game that people go like, oh, what are you playing? 
[00:06:00]  What are you doing, man?  But sat down, did not lose the entire night.  I wasn't even down.  Didn't even go down for a second playing that.  And left again well ahead of when I got to that casino.  So I'm going to be none too happy there.  They don't want to take care of your room because you might win.  Good for you.  Smash it.  Well, there was something, you know, I know a couple of people there.  They're very nice.  But, you know, I guess the casino itself and stuff has a little issue with if you win a 
[00:06:30]  little too much, they're not as apt to give you, you know, a room to stay in as they would  be if you were losing a lot of money.  Don't casinos do enough?  Don't they win it?  Don't they get enough tuitions and homes and life savings to comp a room to somebody  who takes them for a few bucks?  I would think so.  And I would think like back, I like the old Vegas days where it's like you come in, they  give you a room.  They give you a room. 
[00:07:00]  No working of points where it's like you sit there, I swear to you, you could sit there  on a weekend for 14 hours a day just playing cards and you'll end up with like, hey, you  earned three points.  That's good for like, you know, a cheese sandwich down at the buffet.  If that.  It's like, it's not like the old days.  They really don't give to the people that, and this is all the casinos.  They just don't do it anymore.  Because they're all corporations now.  Yeah.  The old days the mob ran it and those guys knew how to take care of people. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  The mob knew how to take care of people.  You went in there.  If you were a high roller, you're playing some big, you know, you're playing big money  hands every time.  They knew, you know, occasionally you're going to go in there and win, but most of the time  you're going to be paying for more than a room would be.  To get comped a room makes you feel like, you know, you're a roller.  You're a player, baby.  I'm going to tell you some Volus.  Play his club card, baby.  But they didn't really want to help you out with the room. 
[00:08:00]  No, there was no help with the room.  I had to pay for the room.  That's what I'm saying.  They should have taken care of your room.  You're going up to gambling a good amount of money.  You know, I wish, but no one does that anymore.  It just doesn't happen anymore.  I don't know why.  Why not?  Because they're creeps.  I'm not talking about some, you know, some woman schlepping in on a bus to play the goddamn  slot machines for a few hours.  That was my grandma with her sister.  Patty.  Same thing.  They would take the bus down Atlantic City.  They were in their 90s at the time.  And they were still going down there playing the slots. 
[00:08:30]  And they were getting their rooms comped.  See?  Back in the day.  So they must have been losing all my inheritance.  That's it?  All your money?  That's what I'm starting to think.  Right there.  But as a family, we're like, you know, she must be doing well because they're comping  her rooms.  And I was thinking at the time, no, she's got to be doing really bad.  That's why they're comping the rooms.  They want her down there to take more of her money.  And this whole BS campaign around this country about the smoking law.  Oh, okay.  To keep the smoking law. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Keep smoking out of the bars because it's dangerous and this and they do that.  Yet the casino.  Let me tell you, you walk in there, you get emphysema.  You get.  There are.  The age.  Every Asian smokes.  Don't the Asians know about smoking yet?  Asian children are smoking.  And it makes me so embarrassing for me.  I use my third grade vocabulary.  So every time like a card comes out that wasn't me, I'm going, I'm consistently getting 
[00:09:30]  jabbed over here.  I'm just getting jabbed.  I kept saying that and I'm like, oh, Jesus.  Surrounded by Japanese.  Surrounded by Asians.  Stunting their growth even more.  And they all get pissed off at each other.  Like all the Asians sitting around the table and one guy's like, they're all telling where  they're from.  Yeah, I'm Chinese.  Chinese.  You?  You like, you, you, uh, Taiwan?  And he goes, no, Korean.  Like they get all pissed off at each other.  And I'm sitting there watching. 
[00:10:00]  This is fascinating.  They're getting angry at each other for making mistakes where they're from.  And hell, I thought you was all from China.  For all you know, it's the same guy just changing outfits quickly and going from sleep to sleep  talking to himself.  I couldn't tell.  I swear to you.  I'm sorry.  It might sound racist, but I can't tell a Chinese guy from a Korean guy.  Yet they're very upset.  I could tell usually Japanese from Chinese.  Right.  But Chinese and Korean.  I got to figure it out.  Very difficult. 
[00:10:30]  If you need help.  Chinese, very slanty.  Korean, not so slanty.  Japanese, kind of round.  Japanese.  Kind of round.  Longer face.  Longer face.  They have fatter faces, Japanese people.  Japanese.  Yeah, but their face is a little longer.  And they're taller than Chinese people.  Japanese, a little hipper.  Have a little, they have a little style to them.  Still love that mullet though.  It's a goofy style, but they try to get, they try to style up their, they try to change  their hair from the straight.  Chinese people all look exactly the same. 
[00:11:00]  Chinese people, very hard to tell from, from other nationalities is what I'm saying.  It's like, very hard to tell from Korean.  And this guy was getting pissed because the Chinese guy couldn't figure out that he was  Korean.  Just sitting there going, just stop smoking.  All he is.  How did he finally figure it out?  A dog ran by and the Korean guy's stomach rumbled?  So you walked away with how much there?  About, let's see.  Did you talk about your winnings on the show? 
[00:11:30]  I did last time.  Yeah.  It was about eight, a little under eight.  Yeah.  A little under eight, geez.  Wow.  A little under eight large.  That's a nice weekend.  Yeah.  Although you now have lung cancer.  Yeah.  Now I have lung cancer and I don't think I'll be allowed back.  No.  They just.  Gotta love the politicians, by the way, because, oh, you know, video games are destroying  America.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Is it the video games?  Is it?  Or there, or there, or are there other problems in this country that you would never, ever touch? 
[00:12:00]  There are signs all over the place, too.  It's like, if you need help, come here.  Gamblers Anonymous.  They have a booth set up to help you.  There's signs everywhere.  You can't sit at a table without looking at a bet with your head, not with your heart.  Do this.  Help is available.  I guess they have to, right?  Illegally.  It's gotta be legally, because they don't want to have it.  It's the worst part.  What the heck?  You're in a casino.  Who forced them to do that?  Because they wouldn't do that on their own.  It's kind of like the warning on the cigarette packaging.  You gotta put it there.  I mean, people just, one guy was putting on a great show, totally distracted the poker 
[00:12:30]  table for about five minutes.  He came over with a little tray of chips and two security guards, and he's just yelling,  I'm not coming back to this crap hole ever again.  Ever!  Screaming and security's just like, yes, sir.  Okay, cash your chips in, sir.  I don't need crap like that.  Guy must have just took a bad loss.  Well, I lost his mind at the table and was asked to leave.  I've met two true high rollers in my life in Vegas, both times when I was working with 
[00:13:00]  Dice, because they loved him.  One guy was the head guy at the Venetian, the top roller at the Venetian, and they said  he lost 700,000 one night.  Wow.  And they said he was just abused.  Everyone hated him.  The whole staff hated him, because he screamed at everybody.  And I watched another one from the Paris, this guy, RJ.  They said he was up five million at one point.  Oh.  And then he wound up losing a bunch of it, and the casino booted him.  As soon as they got a couple million back, out.  They didn't want him getting back.  We got a little bit back, go home.  They would not let him back in the casino.  Wow.  Well, you know, we did, me and my girl were winning, like, couldn't lose. 
[00:13:30]  Really just pounded him.  Playing three cards, you said, right?  Playing three cards for hours, hours, and didn't lose.  Had stacks where the dealer had to keep cashing in our stacks of greens, the $25 chips for  blacks, and then the black chips, which are the hundreds, for the $500.  They just had to keep, like, exchanging, because they were running out of the big amounts of 
[00:14:00]  $25 chips that everybody uses.  So we were just hammering the place.  Then they changed decks.  This is an odd thing about gambling, casinos, and everything.  Something that makes no sense has a huge impact.  They come in.  They change the cards out.  It takes about 10 minutes.  They have to write down.  They count all the cards that were used.  They count the cards that were replacing.  They look at the fronts.  They look at the front again.  They look at the backs.  Make sure there's no markings.  Load it up. 
[00:14:30]  Shuffle them like crazy.  And the second that happened, we could not win a hand.  We went, like, two hands that were just an abomination.  Were you smart enough to tap out, though?  Or were you trying to ride it out?  We said we're going five hands.  Oh, okay.  And we went five hands, won one out of the five.  Only one of us.  So you went another five hands.  And we went, no, no, we only won.  No.  No, I mean you went another five hands.  No.  Oh, you were smart enough.  We said, screw this.  Because everyone makes those limits.  The worm turned, and this is where they get you, so screw it. 
[00:15:00]  We said, cash in.  So you're better than just about everyone else in the casino.  Because everyone puts limits on their gambling.  Like, all right, I'll stay for five more hands.  And then the five hands are done, you're like, five more, I've got to win back.  I've got to win back what I just lost with the five that I was saying I played before I got the five.  Or you'll take a hundred out of your pocket and go, this is the last hundred.  When this is gone, I'm out of here.  And then that goes in, what, two minutes, you're like, got to make it back.  Yeah, maybe I'll just do one more hundred.  Right to the cashier window. 
[00:15:30]  That was it.  Boom.  They counted it out.  I was like, ooh, that's a tidy, nice little sum.  Back to the room.  Done.  Done for the night.  I'm so glad you won.  I'm so glad.  The nerve of them.  Although last time I won up there, I went down and wound up like about six months later  giving it all to Donald Trump.  I gave like about $5,000 to Trump last time we were down there.  Is that the casino that the radio station that we're on is in?  No.  Oh, okay, okay.  No. 
[00:16:00]  But I met those people.  How were they?  Up there.  They were up there?  Yeah, they were doing an event at, um, it's, uh, the Wolf up there, uh, in New London.  New London.  We're on the Wolf in the morning.  Right now, as a matter of fact.  And, uh, they were doing an event at the Hard Rock.  And we just went on the Hard Rock, grabbed something to eat real quick, and a bunch of  people were there from the station.  Said hi.  Said say hi to you guys.  Hi, guys.  Oh, yeah.  Hi.  Took a couple of pictures.  Um, yeah.  Met them. 
[00:16:30]  Got a little, got a little refrigerator magnet.  Ooh.  For my, um, effort.  Hopefully there's, hopefully there's an exciting ending to this story.  There is no exciting ending to it.  Let me tell you.  I'm starting to have some flop sweat here.  A little flop sweat going.  We're being hurted by over a million people, and you're saying you said hi to someone.  Said hi to someone.  Wow.  The one guy from New London Wave.  Wait, that wasn't the GM.  Right.  It was New.  And he goes, wait, he goes, wait.  Uh, we like you guys.  Wait, no, he said we like you guys.  It's an affiliate, Opie.  I'm being nice.  Halfway through the story, I'm like, oh my god, there's no end. 
[00:17:00]  There's no end to this one.  There's no real good ending to this one.  There's no end.  What casino are they in?  Uh, they are at Mohegan.  There's the end.  There you go.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Uh, we got lots to do today.  We really do.  We got a very busy week on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're heading, uh, down to Philly.  Yes.  Broadcast live from WYSP this Friday morning.  We're hoping that a lot of O&A pests show up outside WYSP.  I guess they're going to have, like, uh, all sorts of things going on for you guys.  Uh, I'm hearing you might even be able to walk away with a mattress. 
[00:17:30]  I'm not sure if they figured that out.  What?  I'm hearing breakfast.  I'm hearing, like, uh, like TV.  So if you're outside WYSP, you could actually watch us through the radio show and vice versa.  We'll watch them on the, uh, outside the building.  We'll have tickets to the O&A traveling virus.  Uh, we're pretty much going to take over Philly.  Nice.  And for you early risers in Philly, be the 94th person to text virus to WYSP1.  That's 99771.  And score a pair of tickets to see the O.P. and Anthony traveling virus this Saturday,  September 9th at the Tweeter Center.

You get a pair of tickets to the O&A traveling virus.  Okay?  Right.  There's a dope on the line, uh, did you know the croc hunter died?  No, are you, really?  Who?  Wow.  Stay right there, Vern.  I had no idea.  We'll, uh, we'll talk to you next.  Wow.  Go.  Hoby and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big. 
[00:18:30]  God damn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, Ben, you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  That's your mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers. 
[00:19:00]  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  Oh, good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Lots to do today.  Oh, it's the first day of school.  Well, yes, back to school.  I want to say good morning to all the mommies out there getting up early to make little peanut 
[00:19:30]  butter and jelly sandwiches.  Send out with the children.  Little juice boxes.  Put your juice box in the little lunch box.  I didn't get juice boxes.  No.  I didn't get new clothes.  No, I guess we did get new clothes at the start of the year.  No, didn't the oldest get new clothes, and the rest of you got his hand-me-downs, and  it kind of went down the line?  Yeah.  Is that how it worked?  Well, I got the bruised apple and the peanut butter and jelly on Pepperidge Farm day-old 
[00:20:00]  bread.  Ooh.  Paper-thin bread.  What a great invention.  Pepperidge Farm bread is stale when it's fresh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then you'll leave it a couple of days.  Loose leaf with crust on it.  That was about it.  So, what's up, mom, me's?  Lots and lots of mom, me's out there doing their thing this morning.  That's right.  Drop those should-have-been-abortions off and head back to sleep finally because they're 
[00:20:30]  in school.  The first day of school.  The excitement's in the air.  Everyone's got their Trapper Keepers.  Yes.  Remember the smell of the plastic of your new Trapper Keepers.  Oh, and you walked into school and it smelled like notebooks and a lunch that was cooking  and vomit from the kid that couldn't take not being home.  The homesick kid.  And the janitor had to come over with the sawdust.  You'd write really neat in your first little notebook.  I'd always write small and neat in the top right corner. 
[00:21:00]  Yes, and I'm going to do this all year.  Yeah.  I'm going to be good all year this year and make sure I keep track of everything.  Oh, please.  A weekend, I didn't, I came to class.  You got a piece of paper and a pen?  And then what am I going to do?  And they'd say, what are you going to do with that when you're done writing down anything,  whatever you're writing?  And I'd put it in my pocket and then put it in my locker.  They knew I wasn't doing anything with it.  My biggest memory, first day of school. 
[00:21:30]  Remember you got all your books?  It wasn't even the first day of school.  Well, the first week of school, so you start school up in high school, junior high, whatever.  I'm thinking about those years.  And you bring home all your new books and now you're going to get book covers for them.  Yeah.  And all my friends got like, you know, I don't know, Spider-Man or...  Cool book cover.  Whatever.  What was...  Glossy.  I'm trying to remember some of the things that was cool when we were growing up.  Strawberry shortcake.  Whatever.  Remember, though, you could go to the stationery store and get those cool book covers. 
[00:22:00]  Rush.  Yeah, maybe it was some rock and roll theme.  Yeah.  Maybe a favorite cartoon that was out.  Bugs Bunny.  Maybe a Bugs Bunny or whatever.  A popular movie of the day.  Let me guess who was on yours.  Wallbaums.  Wallbaums.  Wallbaums.  Which is a fine supermarket on Long Island.  So my mom would pile up the Wallbaums brown paper bags and I would have to cut them out and make my own damn book covers. 
[00:22:30]  No, Steve.  I didn't have Heroes of the Luftwaffe book covers.  Where were those?  Were they available?  And then I was trying to find, you know, a part of the Wallbaums bag that didn't say Wallbaums on it.  Yeah.  Which was not an easy task.  So, like, my math book had a big Wallbaums on the front of it.  Is that where you...  Did you draw over it with big, thick, black, Matt and Parker, a Van Halen logo?  Oh, yeah.  I did whatever I could. 
[00:23:00]  Maybe to hide it.  The logo everyone could draw.  But all the kids knew I was just poor.  I tried.  We had to dress like little business men.  My mother was a weirdo.  She sent me and my brother out.  First of all, we had to be dressed alike, even though we were about 18 months apart.  Yeah, like 18 months apart.  And she put us in these dress shirts and ties and, like, plaid pants and brand new dress shoes and these school bags that looked like briefcases. 
[00:23:30]  What faggots.  Yeah, we went to school.  It was like, you know, I'm in second grade.  And I'm plopping my briefcase on my desk going, what do you need to close this deal?  What do you need?  Because my people can supply it.  I'm in first grade.  I'm dressed like a little conservative businessman with a tie.  Never got to be a kid.  I had to be an adult my whole life.  Two little Angus Youngs skipping down the street. 
[00:24:00]  A couple of creeps.  Yeah, even though we were on Long Island, we had the little English schoolboy hats on.  Little knickers.  Little boyish calves showing.  Nothing beats my mother, though, with that goddamn fur coat when Joe Namath got a fur coat.  Joe Namath, Joe Willie from the goddamn Jets, legend.  And he was, this is after his knees completely went out.  And he's on the sideline and he's in this big, heavy fur coat. 
[00:24:30]  And guys didn't wear fur coats.  Joe Namath, he could wear a fur coat.  Joe Namath wore stockings in a commercial.  It didn't take away from his manliness.  The guy gets drunk and tries to pick up broads on TV nowadays.  The guy's all man.  It's true.  Doesn't matter, he's wearing a fur coat.  Smells like brute.  Right.  My mother decides in the third, fourth grade, I'm not sure what it was, that because Joe Namath  looks so cool in it, let me get Anthony a fur coat and send him off to school. 
[00:25:00]  How bad did he get beat?  Just pummeled.  How bad did he get beat?  It looked like people were clubbing a seal, a baby seal in the playground.  Because there I am in my fur coat that mom thought was cool, just being punched because  I was wearing a fur coat and being called a faggot.  Can you get these pictures back up on the website?  I haven't seen them.  Yeah, yeah.  Since last year when you told all these stories.  There are some people.  Well, there are new people listening.  Holy.  There are new people listening. 
[00:25:30]  Holy, yes.  Little Italian pimp.  New London.  The cement bag story's on the way, kids.  Holy crap.  And guess what happened with a girl I was paying for sex?  Boy, I can only imagine, Jimmy.  I'll make believe I'm listening to it for the first time.  I want to hear Jimmy say something about a thorn bush or his lap.  What do you want to sit in?  Oh, yeah, Julie, her name was.  Good old Julie.  She didn't choose Jim.  She certainly didn't.  I'll take those bushes.  Fast forward 15 years later. 
[00:26:00]  Hi, Daddy.  Here's your money.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I told you I was at the U.S. Open yesterday.  Yeah.  We got, well, this was a couple days ago.  We got Andre Agassi crying.  It's over for Andre Agassi.  It's over.  He didn't win.  Didn't go out with a big win.  Nope.  No.  He did good, though, right?  No.  Not really.  He did good at the beginning, but he was like.  He knew he wasn't going to do that well with the U.S. Open, but he wanted to retire, you  know, playing the U.S. Open. 
[00:26:30]  So he made it through a couple of the early rounds, I guess.  Yeah.  Then Becker beat him.  And then it was time for him to cry.  And then they get the towel boys and the guys to sweep off the court and bring on the new  guy.  That's it.  It's over.  Andre Agassi, dumpster.  All his rackets are in the dumpster.  Here we go again.  Trying to give the new kid some advice.  He doesn't want to hear it.  About Schmidt.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's our new thing.  We have to reference about Schmidt every day. 
[00:27:00]  While you were in Dallas, we were doing a whole thing on about Schmidt on Friday.  Anytime someone retires, it's over, Johnny.  I guess he's just in the dumpster.  Telling his stories and stuff.  The new kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  You want to clear the court here?  I'm busy.  I'm practicing.  He wants to go see Brooke Shields.  He walks in.  There's a vacuum cleaner running.  Stupid shoe is askew off her body.  Even though he's not with her anymore.  But I don't know who he's currently with.  Steffi Graf.  Oh.  Steffi Graf.  Steffi Graf.  Steffi Graf.  Man, what happened? 
[00:27:30]  I guess as his skills deteriorated, his taste in women deteriorated.  Yeah.  Steffi Graf.  She awful?  Yee.  Didn't the Germans stab her?  Who was the one that...  No, that was Monica Sells.  God, and I was saying I don't know much about tennis, and I'm looking at me...  You know enough.  Look at me just throwing tennis facts out today.  I heard...  My neck hurts, by the way.  She had blocked in that guy, though, and he instinctively stabbed her.  No?  Nothing?  I don't get it.  We hadn't hit on the Stingray story yet.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's on the way. 
[00:28:00]  My brother wants to call in as the Stingray expert today.  Is that okay?  We have a Stingray expert.  My brother, the marine biologist.  That's true.  Yeah.  You know, the family is proud of that brother, not me.  Your goofiness.  Right.  Well, here's Agassi crying the other day.  Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty.  You have pulled from me on the court and also in life.  Shut up.  I have found inspiration.  You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments. 
[00:28:30]  And I have found generosity.  You have given me your shoulders to stand on, to reach for my dreams.  Dreams are good to never reach without you.  Over the last 21 years, I have found you, and I will take you and the memory of you with  me for the rest of my life.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you? 
[00:29:00]  Thank you.  The fans, they were going to be there no matter what.  Whether it was you or some other dope hitting the ball back and forth.  I hate to tell you, Stu, but you weren't curing cancer.  You were playing a girl sport.  You were swinging a racket and knocking a ball over.  Who held you on their shoulders and willed you to do well?  Nobody cared.  And it's one thing to have that, you know, well, it's been a great career.  But he just did the whiny through the whole speech.  I climbed, I saw a little daffydil and climbed upon the hill. 
[00:29:30]  He just whined through the whole thing.  You held me on your shoulder.  Oh, shut it.  Clam up.  Everyone wants that classic retirement speech.  Yeah.  Like Lou Gehrig.  Lou Gehrig.  I'm the luckiest man in the world.  That guy knew he was going to die and he wasn't, you know, crying.  Right.  Lou handled it with dignity.  Right.  Yeah, Agassi had already been crying a good ten minutes, Mike, as soon as he lost. 
[00:30:00]  And, of course, the guy that beat him lost in straight sets in the next round.  Well, that's the match I saw yesterday at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.  It was Becker.  That's what the stadium you sat in?  You're a brave boy.  The Arthur Ashe one?  God almighty.  Bleeding or no bleeding?  You know, this is coming in like crazy.  Can we get this over with?  Dan and Philly, go. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, sorry, Oat, man.  It's a little too late to rip on you now.  You guys already went on.  I was just going to say, man, if you use the inside of the brown paper bag as the outside  of your book, you could do all kinds of crazy.  Well, like I said, I was strategically trying to figure out how to do my book covers without  the big Walbaums logo.  And I did try the inside thing.  But those paper bags, see, I can't believe I have to explain this to people.  They're so thin you can still see it backwards.  Yeah, you see the bleed through. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  And then when you did turn in, I can't believe, you know, you just got to go with it, people,  sometimes, please.  Because then when you also did the inside out thing, you got the creases, which was a pain  in the ass, too.  Yeah.  And the folds or whatever.  What's the word I'm looking for?  Crease.  Crease or whatever.  Yeah.  So thank you, Dan.  You lifted me on your shoulders.  It was supposed to be a quick, dumb little story.  We didn't have to go deep into the story.  Where were we?  Oh, Arthur Ashe Stadium.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the Billie Jean King Stadium, then? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  The carpet.  They're renaming another stadium over there or something.  It's just the whole court is full of curly hairs.  The whole court.  There's the clay court, the grass court, and now the little black curly-haired court.  It's all overgrown.  That's the way she likes it.  Also, we don't talk about golf often, but it's pretty amazing.  Golf without the L. 
[00:32:00]  Tiger Woods won again yesterday.  Five tournaments in a row, which is just unbelievable.  Wouldn't be allowed at Bushwoods.  His dad dies.  He takes six to eight weeks off to mourn.  Comes back during the U.S. Open.  He wasn't ready to play golf.  He didn't even make the cut for the first time in his career or something like that.  And then since then, he's won every tournament.  He's won five in a row, including the PGA Tournament and the British Open.  Just an amazing run for Tiger Woods.  I wish he was blacker. 
[00:32:30]  Came from behind yesterday.  Just because it annoys people that this young black dude is just smashing all this old white man sport.  I love the fact that Tiger Woods is just winning everything.  But he's like, you know, part black.  Part Asian.  Well, when he came on the scene, they weren't too happy that they had a shwoogie playing.  Well.  Playing so well.  But then the stories were written.  But then they're like, yeah, but he's that word.  Well, yeah.  In the locker room.  They weren't brave enough to say it in print.  But then they were saying, well, he's only part black. 
[00:33:00]  And he's also.  What is he?  Part Asian.  Part Asian or something.  And they're like, all right.  That's all right.  We'll just say.  Yeah, we'll let you in.  We'll just say he's half Asian.  They don't want like Mookie Wilson black out there swinging a club.  Mickey Rivers.  Yeah.  Mickey Rivers.  They don't want that out there.  No.  I want Yafit Kodo black.  That's who I want.  Yafit Kodo.  And, well, here's the big story that everyone's talking about this morning.  Hmm. 
[00:33:30]  We'll do the new story here.  And then we'll comment, I guess.  It was the way he lived his life.  He was shooting a new TV series in North Queensland called Deadly Sea Creatures when he came too close to one.  Rich Voss.  The 44-year-old was swimming at Bat Reef off Port Douglas around 11 when he was struck in the heart by the barb of a stingray.  He came over the top of a stingray and a barb, the stingray's barb went up and went into his chest and put a hole into his heart. 
[00:34:00]  It's likely that he possibly died instantly when the barb hit him.  A rescue helicopter was called, but there was little the medical team could do.  Friend and colleague Trevor Long from SeaWorld says stingray toxin causes your circulation to shut down.  There's no antidote to it.  It's just a very horrible venom that we don't know a lot about.  And getting hit in the trunk is a bad situation.  Steve Irwin's body was taken to Cairns Hospital and word spread south swiftly with 9 News first reporting just after 2 o'clock something terrible had happened to the crocodile hunter. 
[00:34:30]  I love people are shocked about it.  I can't believe it.  Yeah, I know.  Guy ran around sticking his face in crocodile mouths, eventually got smashed by something.  What did you expect?  By something, but the thing is.  Yeah, I mean, he's the type of guy he took a lot of risk and he probably would have wanted to go out, you know, with a croc just ripping his head off or something.  Going in a death row.  Right, but to get.  He's got my head.  To get killed by a stingray.  A stingray.  We've been doing our research this morning, Jimmy. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, here's a little stat for you.  Since ever.  Since ever.  Since the beginning of ever.  17 people have been killed by stingrays on the planet Earth.  I cannot verify other planets that have a sea full of stingrays.  It's safe because we don't know how many exist.  It's safe to say 17 in the known universe.  In the known universe are dead because of a stingray. 
[00:35:30]  He's one of them.  I was toiling, trying to find something that people died of, like 16 people died of it or 15 or one.  Is there something out there that only one person died of?  Um, I think that you, there are more people who have actually died being accidentally struck in the temple by Asian testicles. 
[00:36:00]  Probably.  There has to be at least one.  Is that, what is it that is less than 17?  We can't find anything.  Uh, because the ones we got in front of us, uh, there's a, there are a lot of people, but statistically the chances are low, but there's still a lot of people because there's a lot of people on the Earth.  Right.  I'm really going out on a limb there.  Well, no, but I know what you're saying is there's 17 people total.  I actually read the list.  16, the next 16 down, 16 people in history have been killed by daisies. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, we, we found out that, um, shark attacks aren't, uh, very, uh, deadly every year.  A lot of people, more people we figured, uh, were killed by vending machines falling on them from them trying to tip it over to get their snack out or, or, you know.  Yeah, that's a true stat.  A swindle.  Yep.  More people are killed by vending machines than by sharks every year.  Um, well, the airplane crashes. 
[00:37:00]  But, uh, 30 million Americans describe themselves as anxious flyers.  And, uh, of course they got a fear of dying in a plane crash.  Um, it's once every, let's see, a statistical expert in the field of aviation safety, your actual risk of being involved in a fatal airline accident once every 19,000 years.  That is provided the person flew on an airplane once a day for 19,000 years. 
[00:37:30]  So, if you fly, once a day, 19,000 years, you'll probably crash.  Numerically, yes.  Once.  However, on every plane crash, there's somebody whose first flight it is.  Right.  And it, their fearful flyers and their friends throw this dumb stat.  Oh, did you fly for 19,000?  Yeah, could I?  And that's the last thought they're thinking as it goes, dives into a cornfield somewhere.  Great.  Fantastic. 
[00:38:00]  Great.  This is exactly what I was worried about.  That everyone told me not to worry about.  Yeah.  You're right, Jimmy.  Now someone else gets 38,000 years.  Right, right.  Because they died on their first flight.  You could have my 18,999 years.  Or whatever it is.  Right, whatever.  I wasn't doing proper math.  No, I know.  Get on Hooters Air every day and see if you make it 19,000 years.  Well, here you go.  Stingray.  Well, this is the six most feared but least likely causes of death in front of us.  So, it's airplane crashes, shark attacks, being murdered, falling to death. 
[00:38:30]  Being murdered?  Being murdered.  According to the World Health Organization, one person is murdered about every 60 seconds worldwide.  And in 2000, an estimated 520,000 people were murdered in the world.  Although this sounds like a lot, let us put things into perspective.  In 2000, over 6 million people died of cancer.  Yeah, but I'm not even talking.  See, these are the wrong stats.  We're looking at if one person's murdered every 60 seconds worldwide.  Let's say one person was killed by a stingray every two minutes. 
[00:39:00]  That wouldn't be a lot worldwide.  Right.  But that's a lot.  I mean, it does.  17 in the history of history.  17.  What is that?  One every what?  One every.  Someone do the math.  It's one every.  Like the last time, people were walking around with puffy, powdery wigs, perhaps.  Maybe even earlier than that.  Well, I believe that the world's only about 2,006 years old. 
[00:39:30]  Is that it?  So let's just.  You from that school of thought?  Yeah.  So why don't we just do the math?  Like Earl.  We've only been in existence over 2,000 years.  A little over 2,000.  2,000 years.  Diamonds were with people.  So throw the 17 into that and someone give us a quick figure, okay?  That old gag.  Shut up.  Look at the rocks.  Oh, it's amazing how they discount carbon dating, the religious idiots.  Yeah.  Look at the rocks.  Being murdered.  Falling to death is up there. 
[00:40:00]  It's falling.  Something we fear, but most likely won't cause our own deaths.  And a terrorist attack is in there.  And natural disaster.  Natural disaster seems like that's pretty dangerous.  I don't care that it made this list.  Natural disaster, you get something like the tsunami, earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, mudslides,  all that happy stuff that happens all over the world.  I don't care that they're saying 1 in 3,357, your lifetime odds of dying from natural force. 
[00:40:30]  It's still a lot.  Oh, Stingray-related news tease.  Great.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Because now they're the most dangerous thing ever with 17 deaths during ever.  They're very creepy looking, though.  You know why no one dies?  Because no one goes near those creepy looking.  They're just...  But they always said they look, like, scary.  And they got that tail and everything.  And it's pointy.  And you go, ooh, that's scary. 
[00:41:00]  But then the people go, nah.  They say they're harmless.  They won't do anything.  The kids would pet them down at SeaWorld in Orlando.  They have the tanks where you could stick your hand in there and pet the little guys.  Like they're a puppy.  Like a puggle.  They're awful.  I'm a little freaked out today because I went down to the Cayman Islands.  And why would my headphones be fixed?  And went scuba diving and snorkeling.  You know, a lot of water sports.  You all right there, Anthony?  And then...  Yeah, they're okay now.  And then I went on a little adventure called... 
[00:41:30]  Well, we went to Stingray City.  Stingray City.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there nodding their heads.  They also have gone to Stingray City.  They're all hanging out at the bar right now, tipping some back, laughing about how one got  one over on the big guy.  You go to Captain Ahab's boat, or whatever the hell this guy's name is.  He started this Stingray City tour back in like 1950.  He's still doing it.  There's no laws, no regulations, nothing.  No talk about safety. 
[00:42:00]  And then they take you out to this place.  The water is no more than four feet.  Oh, so it's safe.  Crystal clear.  And you jump off the back of the boat, and they have food.  Next thing you know, you're completely surrounded by stingrays.  That at any moment could have thrust a spike into your heart.  And they're big, huge doormats.  They're not little ones.  These things are huge.  And they're all over the place.  And I'm thinking to myself, this cannot be safe.  Oh, boy.  But we did it.  And you're petting them.  They encourage you to dive underwater because you've got your mask on there. 
[00:42:30]  Mask.  And you're petting the stingrays.  They're taking pictures.  Then this Captain Ahab, who's been doing it for over 50 years, he now proceeds to start  picking up the huge stingrays and giving you what's called a back massage with the stingrays.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Give him a chest massage, too, with the spike.  Right.  Talk about agitating these guys.  I don't think they want to be out of the water, but Captain Ahab said it was okay. 
[00:43:00]  So we all lined up to get a little stingray back massage.  What's that?  He puts it on your back?  And you feel it.  It's like rubbery, whatever.  And they flap in their little wings or whatever.  And it gives you a nice quick little back rub.  But they're flapping like crazy because they want to be back in the water.  Because they don't want to be on your back.  And they're moments away from showing you what that dagger could do.  Thrusting that dagger into your chest.  No clue whatsoever.  I'm thinking it's the safest thing in the world.  But, you know, and I was reading about stingrays over the weekend. 
[00:43:30]  And most of the times when they do attack is when you step on them.  Yeah.  Well, when you're in four feet of water and there's probably close to 100 around you,  it's pretty easy to step on one of these things.  And then what do they lay that thing into you like your calf or something, I bet?  Who knows?  You step on it.  They flip their tail up.  Foof.  But people are getting confused.  A stingray has that long tail.  Yeah.  It's not the actual tail that gets you.  It's not at the tip of the tail.  No, it's sort of in the middle of the tail.  All of a sudden, where's the picture?  Here it is, Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  In the middle of the tail, this thing comes out.  It's like an 8 to 10 inch, like bony.  It looks like a dagger.  Yeah.  And that's what got Steve Irwin.  Ew.  They're just creepy, prehistoric monsters.  We were talking about that when stupid Bob Kelly was talking about his snuba, his snuba-ing,  where he would, Ovi's talking about scuba diving and going down to these wrecks and, you know.  I mean, I'm not, I mean, I'm a beginner. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, when I tell my scuba diving stories, there are people out there laughing at me too.  Yeah.  But at least I got to laugh at stupid Bob Kelly and his snuba adventures.  You're self-contained.  That's the, you know, that's the SC part of scuba.  Right.  You're self-contained.  You're alone.  You're there.  You know, it's you and the elements and you're in the ocean.  He's talking about, oh, dude, I did this snuba, dude.  And he's making it sound like he's the new chock himself.  The snuba is when they take what is pretty much a long snorkel. 
[00:45:00]  It's a snorkel thing that goes in your mouth with a tube that goes up to the surface.  That's hanging on a little floaty.  So you can go down about 20 feet.  I think the tank's hanging on a floaty.  Yeah, a floaty.  It's not scary if.  Don't I snuba, dude.  It's not scary if you're underwater and you could hear the guys on the boat that took you out to this adventure, you know, ordering their lunch.  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  Snuba is when you put on like, it's like when you put on, what do they call the head things?  To keep your eyes clear.  The mask.  Snuba is actually, you put on goggles and you're in the front seat of a car and then you bob your head into the lap of a gentleman. 
[00:45:30]  That's what snuba is.  Snuba.  And stupid Bob will pontificate, dude, you know, stingrays.  I guarantee you right now, he's reading about stingrays and he'll bore somebody he's working with.  Dude, statistically, shut up.  He's rehearsing what he's going to be saying.  Always, always.  Dude, you know, the stingray, relatively harmless, dude.  At the cellar, I told you, we mentioned John Travolta and we, no, well, he got his planes actually before, uh, before he did Pulp Fiction. 
[00:46:00]  Nah, dude, he got them after.  And someone's like, no, no, he had them before.  And his, he was so rehearsed, he couldn't deviate from that fact.  He can't go off script.  There's nothing.  We're late.  We got to take a break.  The phones, they're lit.  A lot of people on hold, they want to comment about this story and, uh, and stingrays in general.  I don't know.  There's somebody that said, uh, we'll do it after the break.  Oh, he hung up with me.  Ah, damn it.  Well, that guy should call back, too.  I wasn't.  Cody in Dallas, I did the math.  In 2,000 years, a stingray kills someone every 117 years.  Look out, they are the new SARS. 
[00:46:30]  17 years.  Right.  And that's only going back to the year zero.  Going back to the year of our Lord.  Year of our Lord.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:47:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Lots going on this morning.  Uh, we got a new contest.  We did this one other time.  We didn't have enough time to, for it to be effective, I guess.  Right.  So we're doing it again.  Uh, send us your 30 second or less production piece about the Opie and Anthony show and the  week of October 2nd.  So you got just under a month here.  Yeah, you got time.  We're going to announce the best five entries.  We did this about a month, month and a half ago, two months, maybe submit your entry at 
[00:47:30]  923freefm.com.  Yep.  923freefm.com by September 29th at 9 a.m.  You can win the new MacBook.  Yeah.  That's very cool.  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities and you can take  it with you wherever you go.  Head to the Apple store or apple.com to check it out for yourself.  All right.  Now you got plenty of time.  Be creative.  A lot of new stuff, uh, been on the show since we last had a contest like this.  Use that.  Incorporate that into your production piece. 
[00:48:00]  Have fun with it.  Let me go to Jared.  And make some real lousy ones, too, because those are fun to play and show how crappy  you are at production.  Make Steve laugh.  Let's say hi to Jared.  Jared.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  Sir.  Anthony.  Hi.  I think you said, uh, your chance of getting, uh, killed in a plane crash is like one every  19,000 years.  Yeah.  The guy in front of you gets killed on his first flight.  So you said, uh, 38,000.  Oh, I said, dude, I said my math was, uh, was a little off on that one after, uh, Jimmy Norton, 
[00:48:30]  uh, had said, you know, I think Anthony was just trying to make a quick joke and he didn't  have to like actually figure out the math.  Hey, well, you guys think of math.  We all know that.  Can I, uh, say hi to somebody?  No.  No.  Uh, Matt in Virginia.  She just said it's stupid.  What's up, Matt?  Yeah.  My dad died last year when I told my kids they were upset for about 15 minutes.  Yesterday, my kids were inconsolable.  They cried all freaking day.  I had to complain what was going on to them. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, they got upset when, I learned at birthday times when they found out grandpa wasn't going  to give him anything, but.  How old are your kids?  Five and seven.  I wouldn't even have, I wouldn't even have told them.  Nah, you don't tell them.  The reruns will run forever on TV.  They won't know the difference.  Why do people tell their kids stuff like that?  Huh?  It was on the TV.  They heard it.  They don't understand.  You tell them he's making a movie.  Yeah.  It's part of his movie.  It's part of his movie.  Why do they like him better than your father?  Was your father, would he sneak over?  Was he like a croc hunter of a different type? 
[00:49:30]  He lived in Florida.  Was he like a stingray?  The kids got too close and his spike came out?  There you go.  Stupid me.  I do a wordplay joke when you come out with that brilliant line.  All right.  Well, the kids are sad today.  The kids are sad today.  And I didn't tell them.  It was just all over the news.  No, I know.  It was on the radio.  Once again, making a joke there.  Obviously, they couldn't avoid the death of the croc hunter.  And all Australia really has is this guy and the crocodile Dundee. 
[00:50:00]  That's pretty much the only two people that are the ambassadors from Australia.  They have lost 50% of their celebrities.  That's it.  That stingray took half of their celebrity status.  They took a big hit.  Well, I'm just going to let them watch cartoons so I don't have to deal with this again.  Yes.  A nuclear bomb could hit Hollywood and we'd still have more celebrities than Australia.  Right.  Who else?  Who do they have left?  They have Crocodile Dundee, but how old is he?  And Olivia Newton-John.  She can hum Xanadu. 
[00:50:30]  Who cares about her?  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  The kids are sad today.  Yes.  Bill from Waterford Dudes.  I was out.  No.  Where was your other one, Bill?  Stinger, it would have done that to her.  It would have been nothing to hit.  I missed it.  Well, possibly there would have been.  Who knows?  50-50 shot.  Where was the other one, Bill?  Where it counts.  Bill had a really good one, and I can't find it now.  But basically, they have video of Steve Irwin.  Yes.  It was being taped for a special that he was taping for his kids show. 
[00:51:00]  He had like a little kids show.  And there was a cameraman right in front of him.  And it was showing Steve Irwin swimming toward the camera with this huge bull stingray underneath him.  And I guess from the cameraman being in front and Steve Irwin coming over the top, the stingray felt boxed in, had nowhere to go.  And he flipped his stinger up and got Steve Irwin right in the chest.  The barb.  The barb went right in his chest, put a palm-sized hole in his heart. 
[00:51:30]  But Steve Irwin actually pulled it out.  He was underwater.  He was alive long enough to pull the stinger out.  And then that's when the cameraman saw some blood, and he was motionless, and that was it.  He was done.  He tried to talk in the boat or something.  By the way, why don't they just show it?  I mean, they showed 9-11 footage.  They show every other earthquake, tsunami footage on television.  Why are we, we might not get to see this one?  Two schools of thought here.  His wife said the network actually owns the footage, Discovery. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  So they say they're going to let the wife have the final say in this.  I'm sure there will be money offered.  There will be things, you know, negotiated and a lot of hype around this.  If they ever do show this on Discovery, it's going to be prefaced with a whole, his career and everything,  and warnings about, and coming up.  A very special show.  And we want you to know that this is not sensationalizing anything.  This is educational and blah, blah, blah.  But they don't show you the negotiations behind closed doors with Steve Irwin's wife or widow. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Saying, hey, you're going to still have to pay for the college education.  No, this is a good money.  He went like he wanted to.  And, you know, he would have wanted people to see this, that these animals protect themselves like this, even against people.  And how much?  It's going to come out that he had no experience as far as the animals in the water.  You watch.  Oh, too.  What happened?  They didn't say they put a too hot for TV bubble over the blood like they do on the stupid reality shows. 
[00:53:00]  Ow, that had to hurt on Max X.  Right, right.  Here's Steve Irwin.  The guy who makes any horrific death sound like it's something cool and extreme.  Oh, but you wait, you wait, though.  The experts will probably be on TV this morning saying he had no business being in the water with these creatures.  Already have been.  They have, right?  He was trying to expand his own little world.  He knew all about the crocs and stuff like that.  But I think that was getting kind of old. 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  He did pretty much everything he could, including dangling his little newborn in front of the croc.  In front of a croc like a chicken.  Which, by the way, I had no problem with.  Eh, who cares?  You know, it's obvious he was a loving father, if you know anything about Steve Irwin.  Yeah.  And his father was an adventurer, too.  It just runs in the family.  But I think he was running out of adventures and said, well, let's go to the sea.  So the guy said he was a victim of this voyeuristic, reality-driven television that has also infiltrated the animal shows like this, where you have to top yourself. 
[00:54:00]  And, yeah, he did a lot of the land-based reptile things.  He was a reptile expert, is really what he was.  Crocodiles, snakes, things like that.  He'd been bitten by a lot of snakes.  Remember that one clip he gets bit right in the face?  Mm-hmm.  And he's like, oh, no, he was just scared.  It's all right.  I got into his territory.  And then he figured he'd expand it.  So it was kind of goofy to see him in those khakis and the shorts.  And he'd just jump off his boat in there.  He wouldn't wear a wetsuit or anything. 
[00:54:30]  He'd wear the same stuff he wears, like, in the Outback.  And not the steakhouse, by the way.  The real Outback.  Yeah.  The dirty one.  I bet you it's going to come out, they're going to say that he talks to the experts and  they told him the stingrays aren't dangerous, they don't kill people, but it looks pretty  awesome when that dagger flies out, when they feel threatened.  And I bet you that was the shot they were going for.  Probably.  Kind of like when, you know, he wants the croc to kind of, you know, move forward and then  snap at him a little bit.  Go into a death roll. 
[00:55:00]  I bet you they show it on a Discovery special and...  No, they're going to go fade to black right at the moment.  The lead right up to it, saying this is him jumping off the boat, here's him with the  stingrays, and then they're going to show you the stingray and go, there's the stingray  that got him, and then it's just going to fade to black.  YouTube.  They should show it.  YouTube.  It'll end up on YouTube.  Take it over the world.  Trying to leak it to YouTube.  Do a special called Take That Show Off.  Enough already.  We're acting like the guy who's working on brain tumors died.  Some stupid Aussie running around in a pair of shorts. 
[00:55:30]  Blah, animal, blah.  Shut up.  The guy wasn't a hero.  He was some dumb TV host.  No, you spoke Australian.  Yeah, that's exactly what he said.  That was very impressive, Jimmy.  A little shrimp.  Blah.  Oh, it's a tragedy, is it?  You think he's in heaven going, you've got to be kidding me.  This is the way I went?  Why couldn't it be a rock just ripping my skull right off my body?  Exactly.  Actual leading causes of death.  Leading causes? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Oh, we're trying to figure out how rare the stingray thing is.  We've learned 17 people.  17 people have died in ever, ever, ever.  Do you realize Robert Reed killed more people throwing a barbant to him than stingrays have?  He got too close to him, and he got nervous.  And as the backside tried to clear him, he's barbed up in defense.  It's a very slow, 10-year death.  Just wanted to tussle that white man's afro.  And whoosh.  Fontaine in Michigan, what's up? 
[00:56:30]  Hey, boys.  Great replay yesterday.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It was awesome.  Hey, I think I know it's something that's killed fewer people.  I'm going to tread lightly.  All right.  Remember that video of the guy making love to a horse?  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know if you can say that much.  But, yeah, there's a video of a guy being killed by a horse, and it ain't from a kick to the head. 
[00:57:00]  I want to go on record and say that more people have died having sex with horses than by stingray.  I would absolutely say that.  More people this year have died from that.  Right.  You're talking 17 people over the course of recorded history.  There isn't even a hieroglyphic of some little guy with his hands doing the walk like the Egyptian thing, getting stung by a stingray.  That's how old they can go back and see that it just doesn't happen. 
[00:57:30]  Actual leading causes of death.  Elicit use of drugs, 17,000 a year.  Sexual behaviors, only 20,000 a year.  Incidents involving firearms, 29,000 a year.  Car crashes, 43,000 a year.  Coming in at number five.  This is for the United States, by the way.  Toxic agents, 55,000. 
[00:58:00]  What's a toxic agent?  A toxic agent?  Give me an example of a toxic agent.  Poisoning.  Somehow getting poisoned.  I would assume.  What's the next one there?  Okay, Jimmy.  Zero on that one.  What's the next one?  Microbial agents?  Microbial agents.  All right.  Microbial agents, I think.  Microbial?  Microbial agents?  Microbial.  All right.  That sounds good.  75,000 a year.  Alcohol consumption.  You Alkies out there.  85,000 deaths a year. 
[00:58:30]  Or 3.5% of all deaths a year from alcoholism.  Oh, but go after the video games, you politicians.  Oh, you're getting something done out there, aren't you?  Probably over cocktails, discussing how bad video games are.  These politicians are a bunch of dopes.  Dummy.  Yeah, concentrate on terrorist attacks, because that's a real threat in this country.  Poor diet and physical inactivity.  400,000 deaths a year. 
[00:59:00]  Yep.  That's all the heart attacks, I'm assuming.  16.6% of all deaths.  And diabetes.  When I get my medical supplies for my diabetes.  Yes, and of course, because of all the attention it gets, yes, video games kill 435,000 people a year.  That's 18.1% of all deaths in America every year.  There you go.  Video games?  Did you get a different copy than me?  Actually, if you add up how many video games... 
[00:59:30]  I can't stomach these dopey politicians anymore going after these dumb causes, thinking it's an epidemic.  Shut up.  They should add up how many video game people die in the video games and try to sell it that way.  Do you know how many virtual people were killed in video games?  I probably wiped out like hundreds of thousands in my career.  Hillary Clinton and Chuck Shoemaker going after the violent video games.  Why don't you take on the tobacco industry and see what happens to you?  They are.  They say, don't you smoke. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, whatever.  Come on, kids.  Tobacco, 435,000 deaths a year.  Do you realize if she hung upside down, all the blood would rush from her fat calves and ankles and her head would just blow off?  I like to see that.  Like a bat.  All right, but this morning, stingrays are all the rave.  Experts say stingray attacks are rare, but just how rare?  And are you in danger the next time you take a dip?  Is this another situation where you have to be afraid to go to the beach? 
[01:00:30]  We're going to ask the doctor.  That's coming up next hour.  Got to ask the doctor.  Whoever that woman is, I hope she's now dead.  The fact that those 17 people in recorded history.  How about this?  People might be concerned about stingrays.  17 people in recorded history have died from them.  Next story.  Why do we have to wait for the doctor?  Move on.  Well, you know, you might want to just exercise a little caution.  Shut up.  Why? 
[01:01:00]  We don't want people, you know, getting panicked like they did when the movie Jaws came out and kill sharks that really don't kill many people.  So the stingrays are very harmless.  Shut up.  Do we have the story?  Because I'm sure that story is ridiculous.  Does Danny have it?  He's got to have that.  Danny.  I'd like to take a nice 100 milligram Viagra and I'll go into Stingray City and I'll show them whose boss starts stinging back.  Absolutely.  They look, Opie and Anthony are on TV. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  Crocodile Hunter remembered and they got two experts from Sydney, Australia.  It's on the CBS early show.  You look just like Anthony and I.  It's me and Opie.  You guys are Australians.  We're Australian.  That's the Australian Opie and Anthony talking about Steve Irwin.  I got F'd up, so I got to get smashed here.  In fact, you said Chuck Schumacher?  Yeah, I was so excited with what I wanted to say.  It's a great horse racer.  I was finally making a very valid point.  Give me your feet. 
[01:02:00]  Look at these guys.  Just squint.  Look, we're on TV.  Oh, someone's got to screen cap that, man.  Well, we did the six for the same thing.  Screen cap this.  It's on CBS as we speak.  We'll get it up on opianthony.com so you people can enjoy it, too.  That's funny.  The Australian Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those two fools.  What buffoons we are.  Well, at least Opie gets to do all the talking during this piece, though. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, what happened?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I said Chuck Schumacher instead of Chuck Schumer.  I was getting excited, though.  I was fighting one for the kids there.  Yeah, come on.  I got a little too excited.  I'm sorry.  Yes, it's Chuck Schumer.  I can't get over how funny that is.  We've got to screen cap it.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  This is always something you wonder.  Stephen Queens.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  You're talking about the whole voyeuristic thing. 
[01:03:00]  I wonder how long the cameraman kept filming, how long he kept shooting.  Like, did he drop the camera and immediately try to help, or did he just keep filming the whole thing and he was gone?  I think, from what I heard, he had filmed it because he didn't know anything happened  until he saw some blood.  So, I assume he filmed up until blood started coming out, which means you probably see him pulling the spike out of his chest and then kind of going limp.  Imagine Steve Irwin had something crazy in his thing there. 
[01:03:30]  What is it called?  His will.  And that he wants his body, like, fed to the crocs.  He wants to do it in front of the kids at his zoo in Australia.  It's kind of a sick one.  Imagine how it was his.  It was his wish.  Can you imagine?  Man.  It's like, hey, it was his wish.  I don't think they'd do that.  They'd lower his body into the...  And just watch him get torn apart. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, it was his wish, man.  He wanted to be ripped apart by crocs.  Right.  Well, people do all the other dopey things.  Yeah.  Spreading the ashes, you know, where you swim and stuff.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  He must have just been...  Great.  Great.  Your grandma loved the Long Island Sound, but, you know, I like to swim there.  Yeah, I know.  Can we keep the oceans clear of people's ashes?  Yeah, could you please?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He must have just been like, boom, wham.  Oh, man.  What the hell was that?  Oh, boy. 
[01:04:30]  This is how it ends.  That can't be good.  This is how it ends.  All right.  Here we go.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  This Saturday, we take over Philly.  We can't wait.  And a lot of people are calling and asking.  I thought it was very obvious.  Yes, we're doing our show live from WYSP in Philly this coming Friday, and we're hoping a lot of O&A pests and listeners and fans and what have you show up at the station,  because there's going to be a lot of activities going on outside WYSP on Friday, okay?  It's Saturday at the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey, for everybody in the Philly area. 
[01:05:00]  Tickets still on sale through Ticketmaster Locations, and all the info is up on opandanthony.com.  It's a great lineup.  If it's 10 comedians, it's going to be unbelievable.  And by the way, if you go to opandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com or one of those, there's a link to an HBO poll for Lucky Louie.  They really don't know if they want to bring us back, so if you like the show, please take this survey and say you like the show.  I hate asking for surveys because I hate surveys.  If you don't like it, well, then be honest there, too.  No, don't. 
[01:05:30]  Just say you do.  They need to do a second season, Jimmy.  I hope so.  The ONA Traveling Virus presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  When we get back, Jimmy was in Dallas.  Bob Kelly is here, by the way.  We'll get him.  Dude, you know, 17 people, but that's not talented.  We'll get him in next.  Expert.  Also, we got the news today with Big A and the new star of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah.  Roland.  Yeah.  And I think we have to play some clips from Friday's show for Jimmy. 
[01:06:00]  Jimmy has not.  Did not hear it.  You did not hear this yet.  No.  Roland trying to say Bonaduce.  Pat Fominaki.  Steve Irwin thought he was being made.  What an ass.  So, if you have not heard Roland trying to say Bonaduce from Friday's show.  Yeah.  The bit went on for probably 40 minutes.  We got some just quick highlights.  Worth playing. 
[01:06:30]  Jimmy has not heard.  I've not heard.  Oh, yeah.  And he's the new star of the show.  He's going to come in today and do the news with Big A.  I'm well aware that Roland's an ass.  But I've not heard that.  It's unbelievable, actually.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  O&A, who's this?  Hi.  I'm Tony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I should call.  Oh, fantastic.  Hang on. 
[01:07:00]  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the O.P. and Anthony Show  at 866-313-FREE.  Okay, bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, by the way, the O.P. and Anthony Show, by the way, the O.A. virus 
[01:07:30]  spreading across America, Bob Kelly in studio.  What was that music, by the way?  We just came back to it.  That's good.  What is it?  Dan knows.  What is that?  Look at Dan on the spot.  Wow.  I was stumped.  Brides of Destruction?  Wow.  I knew it.  Oh, it's no Fergie. 
[01:08:00]  Well, I've never heard Fergie.  You like Fergie?  I swear to God, when Kenny said he was guarding Fergie one day, I honestly thought he meant  Sarah Ferguson.  Sarah Ferguson.  That's what an old white man I am.  That's a lot of people think, yeah.  Black Eyed Peas Fergie.  I come every time.  You like her new song?  London, London, London.  No, it's on the radio every freaking 10 seconds, though.  And it's catchy.  I don't come every time.  All right.  I don't know.  Catchy.  I like it.  Catchy.  Dude, I like it. 
[01:08:30]  She's dating the guy from Vegas.  Is she?  Yeah, she's dating the handsome fella from Vegas.  Handsome fella.  All right, 1955.  He's a handsome fella.  He's a looker.  Put that in your tea and sip it, Anthony.  Don't drink a water, eh, Pop?  Listen, we got to get right into the Roland thing, because he's here to do the news with  Big A.  Roland's the new star on the Opie and Anthony show, by the way, Bob.  All right, who is this?  Remember when you were the new star on the Opie and Anthony show?  You're like old hat.  You're like, you know.  Now we got a new guy.  He's a regular, though. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, now you're a regular.  Yeah.  Listen.  Which is good.  Roland, we discovered, is just an ass.  Where's that clip, Anthony?  And who were we talking to?  Was it Edward Norton?  It was Edward Norton, and we had Jason, how do you say his name, Stratham or Stratham?  Yeah, I got it wrong so many times.  Someone else try.  He was in studio, and Edward Norton was on the phone, and we asked Roland something,  and he said, yeah, it premieres wide.  Just some.  He got it all wrong.  We were asking when a film opens. 
[01:09:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Hey, when does Edward Norton's new film open?  And before you play this clip, he's been working for the show for over a year.  Yeah.  And, you know, thanks to Roland for all the great guests we now get on the Opie and Anthony  show.  He's responsible for that.  But he chokes so badly when he gets a mic in front of him.  But we didn't know that until only like a week ago.  We would have known because he's avoided the microphone.  What I'm saying is I'm pissed off that we didn't figure this out a long time ago.  So a simple question.  Hey, Edward Norton was on the phone. 
[01:10:00]  When is his film open?  And he's in front of him, and this is what came out of his stupid mouth.  It's out Friday wide.  It's out Friday.  It's out Friday wide.  Out Friday wide.  So then we've been looking at this guy for a year.  He says this live on the show, and automatically we all go, what?  Yeah, oh my God. 
[01:10:30]  And they all turn and look like, no.  And he froze up even more and tried to explain that he chokes when a mic is in front of him.  And it's just gold.  He chokes in other times.  I told you, I went to the VMA thing, and he was with me.  And I'm like, all right, he can help me find some celebrities in the Senate.  He didn't know who one person was.  I was mind-boggling.  Who was that?  And he just looks at that half-like smile.  The poor guy has probably been flying under the radar since he started with us. 
[01:11:00]  Now he's got our attention.  We're going to exploit it for the next month, and then he's going to be unemployed.  That'll be it.  He's going to have to look for a new job.  But so on Friday's show, we're asking him about celebrities and who's coming on the show.  And all of a sudden, he said Danny Bonaduce.  Yeah.  Instead of Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  From the Parches family, of course.  Of course.  Who does great radio, by the way.  But he couldn't get past either Danny Bonaduce or Danny Bonaduce. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  Which is what he was calling him.  And we were telling him, no, that's not it.  No matter what.  And we're saying, what's his name?  We wouldn't give him his name.  We wouldn't, like, tell him what his name was.  But we're saying, whatever you're saying is wrong.  Don't say it again.  Do not say it again.  And he'd go, Danny Bonaduce.  Deuce.  And just say it again and again and again.  We got highlights.  This went on for an hour.  We just got some highlights.  Oh, yeah.  An hour straight of us just laughing at him. 
[01:12:00]  And it got uglier and uglier.  It starts off pretty nice.  By the end, we're yelling and screaming at him and hitting his knuckles with all sorts of objects.  I didn't think you guys were going to help him through it.  No, no.  Please.  He didn't work it through.  He was going to speak fine when he left.  So here's Roland trying to say Danny Bonaduce.  This is where it all began.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  The big, the big setup.  Wow, we couldn't have set that up better.  Oh, my God.  Could not have set it up better.  Well, I'm going to miss, Van. 
[01:12:30]  That was a wonderful setup.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to work.  Who's the new producer?  Now we have to fill.  Are you kidding me?  Now we have to fill?  Why don't we ask this red-faced chick over here?  Oh, Sam.  What happened, Van?  Bad burn.  Yeah.  Bad burn.  Of course.  Bad burn.  Bad burn gets you every time.  How am I?  How am I?  Now what?  Not a bad burn.  Now what?  You're grabbing the pipes at the urinal, screaming.  She wasn't even worth it.  She was fat. 
[01:13:00]  You see how brilliant that setup was and how professional?  It was natural.  It was conversational.  We brought everyone aboard.  There's people all over the country hearing this for the first time.  But they all knew what they were going to hear.  But I hadn't heard it.  I was dying to hear it.  Right.  I knew I was excited.  Bob was excited.  Yeah.  And then it was like, bam, here it is.  Hit the button and fizzle.  Is there a way to test this stuff first?  Or will it automatically play?  Test it?  Why would there be a way to test it?  Why would it be tested? 
[01:13:30]  It's more fun when Obi gets to hit the button and not know if it's going to play or not.  That's the fun of it.  We could talk about this on Letterman another hour.  That was good, by the way, guys.  That was unbelievable.  Dude.  Thank you, dude.  Dude.  Dave never talks.  Obi just had that face like he was just going to do something stupid.  That was scary.  His feet were wiggling and little chatty Cathy Anthony.  Wow.  Look.  You chatted up.  Why don't you let Obi say something? 
[01:14:00]  Look.  I know you've been waiting a long time.  I know how these things work.  I just can't stop yapping.  I'm an idiot.  I know.  So, Opie.  It was the first appearance ever.  So, Anthony, how did you and Opie meet?  I private dust.  I'm a chatty Cathy.  How funny is Opie though?  He doesn't change a bit.  So, yeah, you really don't hate Howard.  No, yeah, I hate his guts.  Well, yeah.  Your venom just fell out. 
[01:14:30]  I'm really mad because during the interview, Letterman goes, if I had Howard on the next  day, would he tell a different story?  And we said, yeah, he probably would.  But we were trying to get a laugh out of the audience.  The reality is we should have said he already admitted that on Sean Hannity's program.  There's audio out there that Letterman could listen to him.  And I'm kind of mad.  That's the only thing I'm mad at that I didn't tell Dave.  No, you could see this for yourself that, yes, this is what he did.  He admitted it on Sean Hannity.  We kept it light.  Well, whatever.  You know what?  It was perfect.  It was a great appearance. 
[01:15:00]  I got some stuff in.  Ant got a lot of stuff in.  It worked.  Very chatty.  Now we go back.  You know, every time you talk, they zoom in on you and they zoom out of him.  Exactly.  That set up.  The shot goes away.  Do you know?  No.  I didn't talk to the director of photography.  And I looked handsome.  I wanted people to see me.  You look good.  My girl said that.  You look fantastic.  I watched it again because I hadn't seen it since the night it aired.  And I was in a hotel room with a drunken Elo, so I really didn't see it at all. 
[01:15:30]  I was pretty hammered myself.  What was Elo doing besides trying to pry his face out of the minibar?  Oh, we completely wiped out Eatman's minibar.  We wiped out Bob Eatman's minibar.  Was it Eatman's?  Yeah.  So we went to see it up in his room.  So it's me and Elo just ravaging Eatman's minibar, drinking everything.  And by the way, Elo, I'm looking at you on Pal Talk right now.  Where's Elo?  What kind of bender were you on that you didn't shave?  Don't cover your face with your hand either. 
[01:16:00]  Is he growing a goatee?  What are you growing a goatee?  What are you doing?  The boss is growing a goatee.  Yeah, man.  He looks like Ricky Gervais.  Stop it.  Hey, Elo, get a razor for God's sake.  You're a boss.  He couldn't shave because he was having the DTs because he didn't have his alcohol this morning.  Yeah, he didn't want to cut himself with his shaky hands.  He loves trying to turn into the cool teacher.  Yeah, you know what the cool teacher always did, though? 
[01:16:30]  Had sex with the underage girls.  Well.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you going to buy?  I didn't say anything.  Anyway.  I'm so glad that happened to that chiseler Eatman.  Oh, he's probably trying to laugh good-naturedly.  Looks like a skinnier Roland, first of all.  Oh, we were just, we kept opening it up and going, what do you want?  Elo is the host.  Yeah.  It's like he's rifling through Eatman's minibar.  What, Amstel?  Oh, Anthony, Amstel, Bob Bud Light, we got it all here.  And that was after Super Agent Bob Eatman had to pick up the $2,500 check for dinner. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Not including tip.  Who did you bring the best?  Elo ordered two $1,000 bottles of wine.  Jesus.  Well, no, it was like.  It was ridiculous.  It was like, well, then we'd run out of money for the food.  It was like $1,000 and then it was like $500.  Oh, it was.  It was $1,500 worth of wine.  And then.  And no one got drunk because you can only have a half a glass each.  In a trick I've only seen David Blaine do, the amazing disappearing Chiasano, when that 
[01:17:30]  check came up, he actually pulled a sheet around himself, dropped it, and he was gone.  Nowhere to be found when that check showed up.  He openly admitted it, too.  Oh, I know.  He said, I ain't paying for this.  Yeah, God forbid you pay for that.  It was great advertising for the Opie and Anthony show for EFM here in New York City.  Can they all toss in a little bit?  No.  Watching this was hysterical.  Oh, yeah.  It was just watching all the bosses together.  I got the picture of the three of them.  It was like watching Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt sitting down. 
[01:18:00]  Hysterically, they all hate each other.  Right on.  But it's attached.  It's right on, too.  It didn't matter.  Of course it is.  Eatman picked it up.  Eatman picked up the check and then misunderstood the bottom part of the check where it said.  Total?  Yeah, total.  It said that you tip this amount or this amount based on service.  He thought that meant the tip was included.  It turned out the guy had to come back, the waiter, and tap him on the shoulder and go,  excuse me, you left no gratuity. 
[01:18:30]  He had to tell him.  He had to get shot in the front.  Oh, how embarrassing.  $2,200.  Oh, I...  You embarrassed me in front of my friends?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  We went to one of those hipper restaurants in New York, too.  That's okay.  I'll pay for the check, Bill.  Okay, Ralph.  So I was hoping we'd walk away and then it would be in the post that we spent $2,400  at this restaurant.  And didn't tip.  And no tip.  That would have been a good item.  All right.  So this might be working.  CDs should be ready.  Okay.  Look at that filler, people. 
[01:19:00]  Look at it.  Are we brilliant?  We just rehashed what we did last week.  We didn't even know we were going to go there.  That's how good we are.  We don't need scripts on this show.  Do you guys prepare for your...  No, we don't.  By the way...  Here's a prime example.  Dallas, things are moving along nicely.  Yeah.  The L.B. and Anthony Show has a following in Dallas.  They were animals.  Great.  Where were you?  The improv.  Amazing.  And the ONA...  Believe me, every time I've gone back, it's gotten better.  But this was just...  Every show was great.  Last time I was there, there was a lot of ONA fans there. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  That's good to know.  The best heckler ever in Dallas.  He didn't say it.  He just laughed weird.  Jay Davis.  The guy, one of the ONA fans, just laughed just a little weird.  Just...  And he heckled him without heckling him.  That laugh where you're...  You don't think anything's funny?  As a comic, you're like, he's making fun of me.  But no one in the crowd understood.  He's just laughing.  But this guy was like...  Just at the end would go...  By the way, getting back to the Letterman thing really fast, now that it's been a few 
[01:20:00]  days, I'm getting email.  No one in Washington saw it because the Redskins game went late.  Oh, is that what happened?  No one in Buffalo saw it because there was a murderer on the loose and they had to cut  in for live news.  Nice priorities, people.  And there was a few other cities.  So you go to YouTube.  It's all about YouTube and the O.P. and Anthony show.  Go to YouTube.  Throw O.P. and Anthony in the search and you'll see some fine, fine videos from this program,  including our Letterman appearance if you haven't seen it yet.  And you can also, by the way, if you want to see that there was a really weird outtake 
[01:20:30]  with O.N.A. on Letterman where there was like a curse that got through on MySpace.com  slash Jim Norton.  No, no, no.  I'm telling you.  Sheep.  It's right after the Lucky Louie survey.  Pass.  Congratulations on the thing, by the way.  Oh, thanks.  I was talking to...  Oh, sorry.  I was talking to Jim.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I talked to Dane.  So good for you, kid.  Look at the secretive stuff.  That's good.  I still don't know what he's talking about.  Dude.  I'm not supposed to say?  Oh, forget it. 
[01:21:00]  I thought you...  You got it, right?  Just tell secretive stuff over the air.  Acting like that, how do you not get a part?  See these...  How do you get a part?  See these cylindrical things in front of our faces?  They go out to millions of people.  Secret time is when the commercials are playing.  That's right.  That's secret time.  Even though I know Bob is lying, I'm still hopeful that he's not.  Well, you know, I was just trying to kid around.  I understand.  Cylindrical voice.  No, I think there's something really going on.  How was Dane special?  It was good.  It was good.  Wait, they're changing the subject now.  Something's going on. 
[01:21:30]  Yep.  When are you going to announce this?  No, I was just...  Please do.  I was just a guide note.  If I knew something happy, I would have tiptoed in here on highs.  I would have marked turn off, walked in.  I would have slapped his glasses off and laughed.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  I think the Roland thing is going to work.  Do we have to set it up again?  Because every 15 minutes, the audience changes.  A new audience is now listening.  We have audio of a retarded person.  There you go.  Roland is our new star.  So on Friday, we were talking to him on the air, and he couldn't say Danny Bonaduce. 
[01:22:00]  And this went on for an hour.  We just got a few highlights.  And then he's going to come in here and do the news with Big A, okay?  So here's Roland trying to say Danny Bonaduce.  Here's his first try at it.  Say his name.  Say his name.  Danny Bonaduce.  You're in his business, you ass.  I didn't know the names of the celebrities that you're trying to promote on shows and stuff.  I do, and there's that mic in front of me.  What's his name?  Go ahead. 
[01:22:30]  Danny Bonaduce.  You guys don't understand.  This is what he does for a living.  He's got to be in the know.  His name is what?  Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  Hey, douchey.  Hey, douchey.  All right, one more try.  It's, uh, it's...  Danny Bonaduce.  He is falling apart. 
[01:23:00]  Totally.  Danny Bonaduce.  That's just the beginning.  It went on for 40 minutes.  It continues.  Here he is as he keeps saying the same thing.  We just talked to the guy for half an hour.  For the love of God, what is his name?  What is his name?  Go ahead.  Jesus.  Danny Bonaduce. 
[01:23:30]  He's saying the same two things over and over.  Neither one of those is right.  They're wrong.  There might be a third option.  Come up with another option.  Right.  So it would be...  What would that be?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  Uh...  Uh...  Danny.  Danny's good.  We'll accept that.  Uh...  This is...  My mind went blank right now.  Bonaduce. 
[01:24:00]  That's one of the two.  There's a third option.  It's not Bonaduce.  And it's not Bonaduce-y.  What is it?  Why am I blank?  Oh, man.  Danny.  Danny Bonaduce.  Deuce.  This went on for an hour, Jimmy.  An hour.  We couldn't stop having him do it because it was just...  It was...  It was funny every time. 
[01:24:30]  He's the stupidest man.  Oh, and we're telling him, look, no matter what you do, do not say deuce or douchey because  that isn't it.  Right.  Come up with something different.  Yeah.  Deuce.  Deuce.  Douchey.  So, this went on and on, and then about 20 minutes later, it got to this point.  We need electric knuckles.  We need electric...  Yes.  Bring the mousetrap back.  Get a ruler or something, and your knuckles have to get hit if you say Bonaduce again. 
[01:25:00]  Get your hand on the table.  Or Bonaduce-y.  All right.  Okay.  This is like Sharky's machine.  Yeah, let's go.  Sharky's machine.  All right.  What's his name?  Uh, Danny, uh, Bonaduce?  Ow.  Oh, God. 
[01:25:30]  Jesus.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Come on.  Never say that way again, ever.  Breaking...  What's his name?  Danny...  Breaking Bonaduce?  Did he call him Ricky?  Huh?  Did he just say...  No, he was trying to say the name of the show, I think.  Breaking, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And Danny...  Breaking Bonaduce.  Breaking Bonaduce.  Breaking Bonaduce. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, that's him getting slammed on the knuckles.  His hand is starting to shake.  Once I leave the room, it'll come to my head.  All right, come on.  Cut to my head.  Breaking Bonaduce.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You keep saying, you keep saying, breaking Bonaduce.  It's not that.  It's never going to be Bonaduce, ever.  It's always going to amount to your hand being smacked every time you say Bonaduce. 
[01:26:30]  So, it just kept going on and on.  On and on.  And we have, like, a minute and a half left here.  So, then it got to this point.  Why don't you try again?  I have faith in you.  Danny?  Bonaduce?  Oh, I don't know.  And we start hitting harder and harder.  Who was hitting it as red?  Want to end the pain with the rat trap? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, my God.  I forgot to mention, because these are just highlights.  So, we were hitting him over and over again with the remote control and harder as he continued to get it wrong.  And then we got the rat trap.  We gave him the option to get out of it.  Because it was going on and on.  There was no way to end this.  Right.  So, like, you could just take the rat trap and end the whole thing.  Like, a mousetrap really hurts.  A rat trap is ridiculous.  So, he had to stick his hand in a rat trap in order for us to stop this.  A mousetrap hurts. 
[01:27:30]  A rat trap.  A rat trap.  Oh, it really is.  It has, like, teeth on the thing.  Oh, he's hitting harder, folks.  Yeah.  Your hand is red.  Yeah.  You want to end the pain with the rat trap?  Oh!  It's him taking the rat trap.  There you go.  He punched out!  The name is Bonaduce.  Look at his face.  Danny Bonaduce.  How bad is that rat trap?  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Danny Bonaduce.  No!  I just told him. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God!  It's Bonaduce.  What's his name?  Ducci.  Bonaduce.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Holy Christ.  Crap.  I'm going to ask him in ten seconds.  Hold on.  Never.  Don't say his name.  No, wait.  I'm going to wait.  Ducey.  Ducey.  Ducey.  Duce.  Duce.  Duce.  Ducey.  Ducey.  Ducey.  And nine, ten.  What's his name?  Danny Bonaduce.  No!  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys. 
[01:28:30]  Come on, guys.  Wow.  This was an hour, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  It just went on forever.  These are just the highlights really fast.  So then Danny Bonaduce calls back the show because that was a whole thing.  We had a great interview with him, and then he went to have sex with his wife because of  our show, and then we said, well, you've got to call us after the act is done.  So Danny calls back, and then now we're making Roland try to say his name as Danny Bonaduce  is on the phone.  But who can't say Bonaduce? 
[01:29:00]  Bonaduce, how hard is that?  There it is.  Now, wait ten seconds.  Watch this.  We'll just wait.  And then say what he was saying, Deuce and Ducey all the time.  You're saying Deuce, Ducey, Deuce.  Ten seconds.  All right.  What's his name?  Danny Bonaduce.  No!  He's getting it.  He's got the guy.  What a buffoon.  Isn't that amazing?  What a nervous Nelly. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, he chokes.  That's just the highlights.  Like I said, it was a really long involved thing.  It was very funny when Otto called him a gay Napoleon, and then he says Napoleon, but  the Rod Steiger version.  That was Otto's line the other day.  Brilliant.  All right.  With that, we'll take a break.  Roland and Big A are going to do the news today.  And also, we got the Stingray story that we just teased.  Had the news teased.  Oh, yeah.  So they're going to help us out with the Stingrays out there.  Make sure you don't get it.  By the way, everyone getting real nervous, just reading on the news, because I check 
[01:30:00]  it throughout the whole show.  No Stingrays allowed on airplanes.  Oh.  There's Stingrays on airplanes.  Not that again.  That movie bombed, by the way, with all that hype.  Oh, of course it did.  They hyped that movie for almost a year.  Honestly think it was going to do anything.  Sam Jackson owe money to a Colombian drummer for the films he's taking.  You know.  There's snakes on the plane. 
[01:30:30]  Blacks and blackface and white shoes coming up next.  This was a good movie.  What are you doing?  You're a great actor.  All right.  Why don't we do this?  And then we'll come back and do something.  Go.  Bobby and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony.  And I learned a lot from listening to his radio program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice. 
[01:31:00]  And all holes should be banned from the airwaves.  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews.  They have all the money.  So they have nice houses and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell.  Jimmy is a good egg.  But I'm not allowed to be a loner.  Bobby and Anthony!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:31:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That sounds old school, doesn't it?  Who is it?  But with a new edge.  Aliphaz.  Jimmy.  Yeah?  Bring us back. 
[01:32:00]  I'm eating.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  The show's here.  Oh, that was a good one.  What are your better ones?  We're back.  Patty has ruined, like, certain hotels for me.  Stayed, you know, staying at one of the casinos this weekend.  And, uh, I could not go into the bathroom and look at the coffee maker.  Because, remember, Patty was so amazed.  Uh, she never stays in hotels. 
[01:32:30]  And I guess we put her up for the, um, one of the virus shows.  Uh, Worcester.  Worcester.  And she stayed at one of the hotels.  And she, she was amazed at the coffee maker in the bathroom.  And that was, like, the highlight of her stay.  Hey, I got to make a cup of coffee right there in the room.  And I sat.  And now every time I'm in a hotel, I go to take a leak or whatever.  I go, I go into the bathroom.  I look at the coffee maker and have to do a Patty impression. 
[01:33:00]  I said 20 times to my girlfriend.  She was ready to smack me in the head.  Every time I'm looking in the bathroom, I'd reopen.  I'd open the door back up and go, there's a coffee maker in here.  Like, all right, shut up.  Patty, this is how dumb she is.  I saw her at the Comedy Cellar last week.  I think I forgot about this.  It's, uh, she's upstairs.  And she, she, she's telling me I went to Starbucks.  And I got my tips.  And I came here.  And I, and I'm like, well, give me her check.  And they said she already paid.  And she's drinking a cup of coffee she bought.  And I'm like, did you just buy that?  And she goes, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  I'm like, you work at Starbucks, stupid.  Why are you here buying coffee?  And she went, ugh.  And said something.  Get her on the phone because.  She a dope.  Outside Letterman, we decided to do something called Feed the Pest.  And unfortunately, now we're going to have to feed the Pest every time we're out.  Yeah.  We just thought it was, it would be a goof to just kind of throw money at them for showing  up to support us as we do our first Letterman appearance.  Right?  So, uh, Anthony and I had a thousand dollars each and we're just throwing it out to the  people that showed up.  Okay.  And we're handing it out and then we're throwing it in the air. 
[01:34:00]  And Stalker Patty got some.  So there was a little thing on the message boards, what everyone did with their money.  You got, she's got to call the show.  That's right.  She's talking about what she was able to eat because, uh, because we were handing out  free cash outside Letterman.  That was a shotgun shell.  So please, Patty, call the show.  Yeah.  And someone says, Ant impersonates Patty in the bathroom.  Yeah.  There were jokes being made.  It was like, uh, wait, you're, you're, my girlfriend said. 
[01:34:30]  And she goes, do you know you're impersonating Patty in a hotel bathroom?  Like, yeah, that is sad when you think about it.  Dude, I never associate anything with her.  If I, if I walked into my bathroom and I saw Patty laying on the bathroom floor, I would  think, how did this not wind up in the toilet?  And I'd throw her in there until she spoke.  Flush.  By the way, really good news, Jerry in, uh, Chicago.  Saw your commercial at 10 PM on the Cartoon Network here in Illinois.  You guys look great.  It was the one where Ant says ass.  Wow. 
[01:35:00]  Really?  Nice.  That's very cool.  All right.  We filmed this TV commercial.  That is the first confirmed sighting of the commercial.  Can't they beep that though?  Like, won't the networks accept that?  If I think a beep would be very funny.  It also says a lot about the, you know what I mean?  That could absolutely work.  It's your big fact.  On, on the networks, if they have to do that, if they have to change it to the alternate  version, that's fine.  But when, you know, play it on FX.  A lot of people watch FX and forget about the language on that channel.  Yeah.  You can say anything.  Yeah.  And once again, if you want to see the Opie and Anthony TV commercial, go to YouTube. 
[01:35:30]  It's right there.  Everything's on YouTube.  Except the Kennedy assassination.  There's something on there that has something to do with you, and I don't know if I want  to bring it up, but.  Oh, no.  The first six minutes of one of your sets at the Dallas Improv.  Oh, boy.  From a camcorder for the back of the room.  Honestly, to me, because I know how you comedians are.  Can they take that one off?  I'm going to ask them to take that one off.  I never ask for my stuff to be removed, but if you guys are going to shoot sets, that's  cool, man. 
[01:36:00]  Six minutes.  But I'm working on material, and it's like there's certain things you don't want on the  net yet.  Yeah.  So whoever put the six minutes from the improv up, I know you're doing it because you're  a good fan, but if you could take that down, I would appreciate it because, again, material,  man, the first time somebody, comedy's different than music, where they have to hear the joke  for the first time to enjoy it.  To me, it was really cool to see.  I understand your point.  Yeah.  But to me, because I obviously didn't fly down to Dallas, to see this guy in just the back  room of a comedy club from the side, you know, filming, like, the first six minutes  of your set one night, wow, I was like, that is real, I mean, the internet is cool. 
[01:36:30]  I know.  But they're putting the material up that, like, you're not ready to have on the net  yet, and, like, I'm working on stuff at the Twitter Center for other places.  It's like, oh, God.  Yeah, I understand, Jimmy.  So whoever put that up, I appreciate it, but please, if you could take that.  The fans have been cool because every once in a while there's a video that goes up on  YouTube.  We're like, ah, I don't know, man.  Could you help us out and take that one down?  And then there's a few of them that are like, oh, these sellout asses that don't want this  stuff up there.  Well, there was a version of our Letterman appearance. 
[01:37:00]  Was the last one we asked the guy to take it down?  Because, first of all, he filmed it from his camcorder.  He used his camcorder to film the TV.  And then his battery died.  So you're missing, like, two and a half minutes of our stay.  Good job.  And it was all the Sex for Sam stuff, which makes it suspicious.  Like, someone decided, you know, why don't we put the Letterman appearance up there?  That's what someone said.  But let's keep the controversial stuff off.  Yeah.  That's what they said.  Oh, they cut it out so they could shut it off.  No, it turned out the guy's battery just died on his camcorder and he had to plug it in 
[01:37:30]  or something.  So he missed two and a half minutes as he's trying to find the plug.  So we asked the guy to take that down because there's plenty of versions up there of the  whole set.  And the guy was cool and he took it down.  So he'll probably take it down for you.  Most times they're fine.  I never had a problem with a fan like that.  They're actually, they're usually apologetic.  It's like, no, man.  Well, I'm not pissed off.  Stalker Patty.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi, Patty.  Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  So you were outside Letterman when we were throwing the cash and doing the feed the pest  thing, right?  Yeah.  I didn't even know you were going to do that. 
[01:38:00]  That was a surprise because I wasn't paying attention on, you know, whatever.  And how much money were you able to grab out of the $2,000 in fives that we threw out?  About $20.  It's about $20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did you buy with it?  Oh, I bought some food at bar nine.  I had my dinner.  At bar nine.  Wow.  You really went crazy.  Yeah.  It seemed to be a little get-together of the pests at bar nine after the show. 
[01:38:30]  What did you have?  She splurged.  Yeah.  What did you buy with the $20 out of the $2,000 that you could have got?  Way to grab fast.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  I don't remember what I ate.  It was on Thursday.  Because there was way less than 100 people outside there.  So, I mean, the odds of getting some real cash were pretty good.  And she got $20 lousy dollars.  Four fives.  That probably fell to her feet.  I had a $5 bill more under my foot, but the guy next to me wanted it.  I ordered the gruel. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Patty, have you ever eaten, like, a really fancy meal?  Not really, no.  I want to take Patty to the-  Shut up.  Ooh.  I want to take Patty to the Palms.  Wow.  Don't do it.  No, I want to.  You want to take me where?  What?  To the Palms restaurant.  No, just get one of our-  Steakhouse?  The really-  Yeah.  No, just get one of our plebs to do it.  You don't have to do that, Jimmy.  Nah, man.  I want to take Patty-  Patty, what's the fanciest thing you've ever had to eat out?  Well, one time my friend took us all out for Christmas dinner, and we went to a place 
[01:39:30]  in the village, an Italian place, and I remember the portions were very small and kind of fancy  and in a really huge plate.  And all the breadsticks you want, it was the Olive Garden.  So what'd you buy with the $20, did she say?  Food.  What?  That she can't remember.  No, you said it was like a portobello sandwich and a ginger ale or something?  Hmm.  I don't know. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know what I ate.  You posted it on Wackbag!  She posted what she ate?  Yeah, I would have to go back to Wackbag or OA Experience, wherever I put it on.  Hey, Patty, thanks for wasting our time today.  All right.  I'm going to take you to a fancy dinner someday.  Oh, that-  Not you!  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Goodbye.  She has nothing today.  I was going to ask her what the best part of- 
[01:40:30]  What?  What the best part of her weekend was.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, no.  Oh, please.  Please go swimming in Australia.  You gave out $2,000?  $1,000.  Was it two?  I thought it was two.  Oh, wow.  $1,000 each.  I thought I had one, yeah.  I thought it was $1,000 each.  I don't know.  To 100 people?  Something like that.  Wow.  It was less than $100, I believe.  Oh, in 20s?  Or did you do once?  We don't like doing Howie Math here.  It was, I don't know.  It was like 70, maybe 75 people.  Wow.  I would guess. 
[01:41:00]  Behind Anthony, we got Big A and Roland.  Oh, my God.  That's-  I didn't even see that.  How you doing, Big A?  Quickly.  Oh, boy.  Not bad, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  Roland, how are you?  All right.  What happened to your team?  Oh, right.  How are you?  Good.  I saw-  I just talked to Roland.  I wanted to know what nationality Roland was.  Yeah.  Oh.  And tell him.  Spanish.  I didn't know that, and he speaks a little bit of Spanish. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah?  Like Spain Spanish?  No, it's just Mexican Spanish.  Mexican Spanish?  No, no, I mean, you're from-  My-  I didn't mean what Spanish you speak.  I mean, you're from, like, Spain.  My dad's from Spain, yeah.  Ah.  And mom?  She is from Guadalajara, Mexico.  Guadalajara.  So you're like a conquistador.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, your dad, like, conquered your mom.  For spices and jewels.  Pretty good. 
[01:42:00]  Spices.  I want-  I want your-  Those are the days when, like, pepper was worth something.  I want-  I have paprika.  Spices.  Two meals in a sandwich.  You're from Tijuana.  They smuggled roaches.  You know how many people are listening to you right now?  In the U.S. and Canada?  I mean, literally, there are a couple of million people listening.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Big A looks like he got run over by a truck on the top part of his torso. 
[01:42:30]  Hey, Big A can dish it out, though.  Big A.  Yeah.  You have my permission.  You can slam him right back.  Go ahead, Big A.  Go ahead.  Well, guys, don't get him-  Don't get him retard mad.  Jesus.  Big A, you know I love you.  I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  Get him back.  Get him back, Big A.  Watch this.  Yeah, watch nothing.  Watch this.  He makes a comeback.  Go ahead, Big A.  Oh, I've seen it.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Big A.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  Bob, I don't know why you're always picking on me. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  So far, so good.  Wow.  How big was that truck?  I love you, Big A.  He took a lyric from the old Charlie Brown song.  What?  Ugh.  Why is everybody always picking on me?  Did Bob walk in and say, Daddy-O, too?  You nervous retard.  Somebody always picking on me.  Charlie Brown.  Roland.  How was your weekend?  It was good. 
[01:43:30]  See any movies?  Loomis, Sunshine, and Crank.  Again?  Wait a minute.  Yeah, Loomis, Sunshine.  Isn't that the third time?  Second.  What do you like about that movie?  I don't know.  It cracks me up.  It doesn't?  It is a really good movie.  The writing is really good.  Steve Carell was fun.  Yeah?  Steve Carell was really good.  All right.  Can you now say Danny's last name?  Danny Bonaduce.  Chee.  See, you kind of cheat a little, I've noticed.  You go Danny Bonaduce, and then you go Chee.  Like, you just, you added in the Chee at the end. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Kind of made it easier to say that way.  Yeah.  He's pretty happy, though.  He's able to kind of say it.  What's his name now?  Rolls off the tongue.  Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  Danny Bonaduce.  You figured that one out.  I don't like your accent.  Yeah.  I don't like when you do that.  It is very Spanish.  Conquistador.  All right.  We're going to try the news with Big A and Roland.  Oh, boy.  You ready?  Why don't you hand in your pocket, Roland?  I don't know. 
[01:44:30]  Are you a little nervous today, Roland?  I just don't.  Why don't you hold the paper?  Take your hand out of your pocket.  Yeah, it's sloppy.  It's hard to know what you're doing with your hands.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, this will be all over YouTube.  That hand was helping him.  That hand was helping him.  Yeah, because now the other hand just went in search of a pocket.  No pocket for you.  No pockets.  The second you put your hand in your pocket, you have to start the whole paragraph over again.  He took a class this weekend on how to overcome nerves.  The first one was jam your hand in your pocket.  I think he's going to have no problem with this, though, because he's reading it. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  But to have him just talk about a subject, an entertainment story, you know, he just loses his mind.  Let me ask you, who used to run Sony?  Who runs Sony?  You used to be married to Mariah Carey.  Oh, um, Tommy Mottola.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that is right.  Okay.  All right.  Jimmy was trying something, but he now could say Tommy right.  Okay.  He used to say Tommy Lee.  Well, that's...  Tommy Lee, but he would say Tommy Lee. 
[01:45:30]  Tommy Lee.  Who was it?  Like, Tomali.  Tommy Lee.  There.  What did you just say?  Who was it?  Tommy Lee.  Tommy...  No, quickly.  No, no, no, no, no.  Say it.  Tommy Lee.  Ew.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  I love that.  Ew.  Ew.  Get your hand out of your pocket.  Yeah, no hand.  Say his name again.  Say it.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Who, you're the coal miner's daughter?  Get your hand out of your pocket.  Tommy Lee.  All right.  Here we go.  The news with Big A and Roland.  Let's give this a try.

[01:57:00]  Rolling.  Rolling.  And finally, even before she hits the air yet, Rosie O'Donnell is already making waves with Barbara Walters regarding her blog entries.  Is she?  I guess so.  Yeah.  Take it down a notch.  Heard something about that.  You want to elaborate?  Yeah.  O'Donnell had recently complained on rosady.com that her experience creating a TV promotion for her upcoming stint on the series had left her feeling powerless, and her blog auditions immediately drew a reaction from Walters. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  In theater this weekend is Covenant, Hollywoodland, which looks awesome.  Yeah.  And the protector opened Friday wide.  Oh, man.  Wow.  It's out Friday wide.  Wow.  Wow.

When we get back, we got Mike Rowe calling in from Dirty Jobs.  Dirty Jobs.  Yes.  Oh, that guy.  And we got the news trying to scare us with stingrays now.  Yes.  We'll do that as we go to break.  Well, we'll do that after the break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony.  These guys thrash.  Hard. 
[01:59:00]  Come on.  No.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Running out of show.  Quickly.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  ONA Traveling Virus.  You're doing the Philly Show, right, Bob?  Yeah, I'm here.  Yep.  Bob's going to be at the Philly Show.  We've got 10 comedians.  We've only got two dates left.

This is going to be around the same.  Yeah, this is going to be up there.  I think we're going to do at least 9,000, 10,000, I think, in Philly.  Wow.  I thought there was 3,000.  What was I thinking?  Jesus.  We're going to take over Philly.  We're broadcasting live from Philly on Friday.  W-Y-S-P.  Are you guys ever going to take it to the West Coast?  No.  No.  Never.  Uh-uh.  Never, ever, ever. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  I think next year this tour explodes.  Yeah.  Where's Roland?  Huh?  Is Mike Rowe calling in?  Yeah, Mike Rowe's right here.  Oh, okay.  Where's it?  Okay.  Really fast.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, this  Saturday at the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  Tickets still available to Ticketmaster outlets and Ticketmaster.com.  And all the info, including the lineup of all the comedians, can be found on opieandanthony.com.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  All right? 
[02:00:30]  We'll see you guys in Philly on Friday.  We can't wait.  Mike Rowe's on the line.  We met him about a month or so ago.  Mike.  Gentlemen.  How are you, sir?  Too early to know, but I'm always optimistic.  Have you ever swam with Stingrays?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, the first time I saw one, like up close and for real, was on a fish boat.  It was a shrimp boat about two years ago.  And the nets, you know, the nets don't know what they're going to pull up. 
[02:01:00]  You're basically dragging the bottom.  So all kinds of, just like a smorgasbord of, you know, surprise sometimes comes up.  And we had four or five of them.  And the captain, you know, walked over and picked him up and threw him off.  Just easy as could be.  And I joined him.  And didn't really give it a second thought.  He said something like, watch out for the tail.  It's sharp.  And I said, yeah.  Hey, they said that when he got stung, he actually pulled the barb out.  Do they, like, when these things sting, do they lose their barb?  Or does it come back?  Or is it like a bee?  I don't know. 
[02:01:30]  Jimmy, the barb, it grows kind of like fingernails.  Oh, it does come back.  And the reason why kids could pet the stingrays down there in SeaWorld is because they removed the barbs.  Oh, okay.  Now it makes sense.  Making them much more friendly.  What do you got on, Roland?  Nothing.  He's actually, Dangerous Jobs, is that what this show is called?  Dirty Jobs.  Dirty Jobs.  I love Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe.  Roland likes that, too, right?  It's a really good show.  What do you like about it?  He takes you to the other side of the jobs. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  That's perfect.  That's it.  I'm redoing my press kit.  Wow.  No, he said it perfectly, Mike.  Trust me.  Can I ask a question?  Yes, Kenny.  Why not step all over what was going on with Roland?  We were just getting started.  Yes, go ahead, Kenny.  I'm sure this is terrific.  Go ahead.  No, I just want to know, what were you more scared of, the sharks or the monkeys in those episodes?  To be honest, it's the monkey.  Because it's always the thing that you're not really dwelling on. 
[02:02:30]  You know, and with the monkey, you know, we were in Cape Town shooting Shark Week, and everybody was thinking about sharks.  Everybody's focused on sharks.  And then the weather turns, and we've got nothing to do for a few days.  So it was just like this random trip up into the bush, you know, and we're like, well, we heard about this monkey.  We heard about this woman.  She takes care of monkeys.  It sounds like it might be an interesting way to spend a couple of days.  But, you know, the thing is, in all of our heads, we've got this notion of what monkeys are supposed to be like, the same way we think we know what sharks are supposed to be like. 
[02:03:00]  They're cute, and they smoke cigarettes, and they wear overalls and an engineer hat.  Engineer caps.  And they look like little train drivers, yeah.  Sometimes they take you away.  They're adorable.  George, walking around your house in a diaper, you know, cracking wise.  And guess what?  Cracking wise.  I like that.  It's all wrong.  Really?  What you know is wrong. 
[02:03:30]  You know, I mean, monkeys are as complicated as sharks.  There are dozens and dozens of species, and some are predisposed to act one way.  Some aren't.  This woman, well, you know, I guess everybody's got their opinion, but, dude, our house is full of monkeys.  Kenny, happy with the answer?  Yeah.  Roland, your favorite episode of our show, Dirty Jobs.  Uh, the Shark Week episode. 
[02:04:00]  Well, that wasn't.  What?  No, that wasn't Dirty Jobs.  You said you love Dirty Jobs.  I know.  And we got the host, Mike Rowe, on the phone.  The Star Booker.  You booked him.  I blinked.  No, no.  What's your favorite?  Because he actually, Mike, he actually likes your show.  What is one of the episodes you liked a lot?  There you go.  And why?  Mike, just to let you in on the gag, he's a complete zero when there's a microphone in  front of him.  He panics when there's a mic in front of him.  Well, I mean, Anthony, to be fair, that was a hell of a question. 
[02:04:30]  I mean, I asked that.  Yeah, Jimmy asked that.  Come on, Roland.  He likes you a lot.  Mike, he's nervous.  Dirty Jobs.  Mike Rowe's on the phone.  The host.  The Fisherman episode where he went fishing.  Wow, he does make that sound exciting.  What do you, what, what?  What Fisherman show?  What was it about?  Where they went down the water, fished, and they chummed, I guess.  They called it chumming or chumming. 
[02:05:00]  What was that?  Chumming?  They went chumming?  Wait, what did they do?  Is that chummed?  Chum?  Chum.  Mike, did you go chumming?  What, what, what?  Two chums go chumming together?  What did you like about it?  What, what was it?  Yeah, let's go.  Mike Rowe is talking right now.  He's here.  What, what, what did you like about it?  He's a busy man.  He's one of the most famous people in America right now.  I know.  Sorry.  Come on, what did you like?  Uh, the water.  The water.  I don't know.  It's a, I remember that one rolling good times. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  The water.  The oxygen and, and combined together in this liquid thing.  I tell you what, it was, uh, you know, in fact, next, next year we're going to do water  week.  You know, water is probably among the top 10 places to fish.  Yeah.  You know, it's true.  And, you know, to my mind, and again, I'm no expert, but, uh, it's everywhere, this water.  Um, I've seen it come from the sky.  I've, I've seen it in large, you know, concentrated areas, sometimes with salt in it. 
[02:06:00]  It's very fresh.  Which is weird.  Yeah.  Very strange.  Yeah.  Well, so, sorry.  So, you like the one where they went shumming?  Yeah.  Shumming.  Pretty much.  Because for sharks, you have to throw some shum in the water.  Yeah, you have to.  Yeah, of course.  You're a real shit face, you know that?  Well, Roland, I mean, we got big news for you, my friend, because next year, again, we're  coming back with chum week.  Chum week.  Chum week.  Water week.  And it's just, it's just a tribute to bait.  And, um, we, we can't wait. 
[02:06:30]  Mike, here's the thing.  Roland is nervous because he likes you.  That's, that's the problem.  We thought he'd be nervous reading news, but he actually did that well because he didn't  care about the news.  You are someone he actually admires.  Right.  Um, and he wants to kind of interview and ask you questions, but he's nervous.  Uh, the, don't be, dude.  Yeah.  Why don't you, one question for Mike Rowe.  Give him a good question.  A real question.  You're a big fan of Dirty Jobs.  Do you watch, uh, World's Deadliest Catch?  He does that too.  All right.  A real question.  A real, a real question for Mike Rowe.  Yeah.  Uh, what's, what do we have to look forward to in the 100th episode? 
[02:07:00]  No, no, no, no.  Something specific.  Not some vagary.  A real question.  Yeah.  Because he, there's nothing to look forward to.  He's already done it.  Yeah, that's, that's, that's a, that's not a real question for Mike.  Um.  Uh-huh.  Uh.  I'm nervous too, Roland.  Yeah, come on.  You can do it, man.  You just, uh.  This is Mike right here.  Um.  Which episode are you filming now for the next?  He's done.  He's done.  He's done.  What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what he's done?  Oh, he's, um.  Yeah.  What was the dangerous, the most dangerous dirty job you did? 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's what we're going for.  That's an awful hack question, though.  Yeah, what is dangerous, the most dangerous dirty job you did?  Yeah, pretty much.  Be specific.  Like, pick one of the jobs.  All right, I'll give you the F.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Let's see.  All right, well, look, here's the.  See, it has to be dangerous and dirty there, Mike.  Dangerous and dirty.  Right.  All right.  How about driving to the airport?  There you go.  Why, Roland?  Did you have, did you have a, Mike said, he's kidding, driving to the airport.  Did you have an opinion on which one of his might be? 
[02:08:00]  What did you think it might be?  I, I don't know.  Well, you've watched the show.  You said you liked the show.  Uh, yeah, but right now, I'm.  No, you're all right.  Okay, which one?  I don't, I don't remember.  I have a total blank out right now.  What was the last show you watched?  What was on the last show?  That's a good question.  Which one is the shumming?  You were running around here during the commercial break saying you were a big fan, so.  What's the last one you, you, what was your last one?  Yeah, why?  Uh.  That's a really good question, Bob.  I forgot.  I mean, I.  Name one of the ones you watched.  It's the last one. 
[02:08:30]  You're a big fan.  Just the last one, not the middle one.  Just name one of them.  I think it was the, the Trimp one, I think it was.  The, the what?  Trimp?  The Trimp?  Isn't that one the one?  No.  Which one did you say, Roland?  Say it again.  Shrimp?  The Trimp one.  There's a problem I'm noticing with.  Yes, he's an idiot.  Do you catch Trimp with the Trimp neck?  Oh, with, with shums.  Oh, my God.  What is, Roland? 
[02:09:00]  You're ruining our interview with Mike Rowe.  Hold on, Mike.  Kenny wants to lean in and ask you about frequent flyer status.  Kenny, what do you got?  Nothing, Roland?  Roland.  I'm blanking.  What about, what is the show about, Dirty Jobs?  How's that?  It can't get any easier than that.  Explain it for the people out there that may have not seen this show yet.  That's the question, Roland?  What is the show about?  No, Roland's going to explain what it's about because he is actually a fan, Mike. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, all right.  For the, for the new people out there who don't know who Mike Rowe is, what is Dirty Jobs about?  Where he goes around the United States to find people with dirty jobs.  I mean, he follows them and takes you in a day in their life.  What?  I forgot.  It was, I don't know.  Like, wow.  This is just disturbing.  You got any examples of dirty jobs or anything that, which one did you just say?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know.  You just said it.  You just said it.  Which one?  Just say the one you just said.  The other one.  The one you just said.  People are picking up on the fact you said he had a total blank out.  The shrimp one or the.  The what one?  Shrimp.  No, it was the other one.  The one you just said.  Hey, Mike, because we're running out of show.  We got to give you at least a plug.  I mean, we could continue the interview on XM, but, well, we're talking about the hundredth dirty job. 
[02:10:30]  That's the big show tonight?  Big show.  Big show.  Huge.  Hundred jobs.  We basically go to the Army.  It's in South Carolina with the guys who train the elite mechanics in the Army.  So I spend a couple of days with them.  They kick my butt up and down.  What channel and what time?  Because the show is actually computer cutting.  I saw what time this time.  Discovery Network, tonight at nine.  Nine o'clock.  Nine o'clock.  That's the one.  It's a great show, dude.  It's a great show. 
[02:11:00]  And you help recover an Army Humvee that sank to the bottom of a swamp?  Yeah, we drag out all sorts of Humvees.  We, you know what?  We change an 800-pound tire, which doesn't sound like great TV, but it's a bit shocking.  And then we have about an hour and a half of bloopers and deleted scenes and outtakes and screw-ups and the stuff that people really like.  So it should be a pretty good show.  I'll definitely be watching.  It's a great show.  We all know that.  Mike, next time you call, we'll do a real thing with you, okay?  Hey, listen.  I'm redoing my press kit.  I'm rethinking everything. 
[02:11:30]  You should.  Have fun tripping.  And shumming.  And shumming.  It's Mike Rowe, everyone.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, Mike.  We've run out of show, but Dirty Jobs tonight, nine o'clock, nine o'clock on the Discovery Network.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  See you, Matt.  New York's sultry skies and ardent airwaves lends itself admirably to its own form of audio entertainment. 
[02:12:00]  From the supreme skyscrapers to the sanguinary savages running the detestable delis on every splendiferous street corner,  the city is being infected with the outstanding O&A virus.  I dare you to listen to this radio gold and not get infected.  Let me first introduce to you the always gregarious Greg Opie Hughes.  What about me?  What about me? 
[02:12:30]  I love people.  We're just shock chocks.  The amazingly adept Anthony Comia.  We're good guys.  Oh, they're ripping me off.  We suck.  And the smashing staffer, the loquacious little Jimmy Norton.  Welcome aboard.  Pull over into the shoulder.  It gets good.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[02:13:00]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Well, we got a barking dog out here today, so good choice of music.  Why is this fucking ghoul just staring at us?  I don't know.  Someone ask him?  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Huh?  Somebody want to ask him?  How are you, sir? 
[02:13:30]  How you doing?  Good.  You work in the building or you just...  No, I just about to see you guys.  Oh, okay.  Big fan.  We're not used to a guy in a soup being a big fan.  I know.  He's very well dressed.  That's all cool.  He's very well dressed.  We didn't know you were...  You dropped something here.  Oh, he's getting old.  Listen, this is day two.  Unbelievable.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, bro, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  Wait, let's get some money for the homeless guy.  Hey, bro.  You want some...  What's your deal?  You want to be on the radio?  All right.  I run away. 
[02:14:00]  Stay close, please.  I run away.  What's your name, man?  Barnthol.  What?  Anthony.  Your name's Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, good name.  Cool.  Thanks.  What are you all about?  I'm homeless.  We know that, but what's your story?  What's my story?  How'd you get homeless?  I'm just homeless.  Are you the guy that hangs out on 56 usually?  I'm the guy.  I see you sleeping on the sidewalk every once in a while.  Yeah.  Where are you from originally, sir? 
[02:14:30]  Pennsylvania.  And how long have you been in this situation?  Since 1985.  All right.  So...  Wow.  21 years you've been homeless.  Did you have a wife, kids?  No, I haven't.  I'm divorced three times.  You were divorced?  When did you...  Three times.  When was your third divorce?  My third divorce in 1981.  Okay, so what happened?  You began drinking after that?  No, I didn't begin nothing.  I drank on my whole life.  Oh, you were drinking.  I quit drinking in 1988. 
[02:15:00]  I stopped.  My best friend killed himself in the Bowery.  How'd he kill himself?  He walked out in front of the Greyhound bus.  Was it on purpose?  Yeah.  So, you were drinking, and you've been homeless since 85, but you quit in 88.  You still drink?  No.  So, you stopped in 88?  1988.  How come you still homeless?  That was my choice.  Do you want to be homeless?  It is a choice.  Because we hear that some people do want to be homeless. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I want to be homeless because for two years that I haven't been, the only thing  I've been getting has been screwed.  Working, right?  Take my money.  Working sucks.  What kind of shit is that?  Paying a man off.  There's no sense to that.  We've got to stop it.  We have corruption.  We've got to stop him.  I hear you.  Well, so you choose to...  Hold on.  Roland is an advocate of the homeless. 
[02:16:00]  This gentleman's homeless.  He's been homeless since 1988.  You can ask a question if you want.  This is Roland.  He works for us.  This is Roland.  He works for us.  Oh, 85.  85.  Big difference, Jimmy.  Okay.  Well, I'm talking about when he quit drinking.  What's your favorite spot in the city?  No, no, no.  About being homeless.  Ask him a question.  He's a poor individual right here.  Speak. 
[02:16:30]  How long have you been homeless for?  I already answered that.  Since 1985.  Yeah.  Okay.  Something else.  Have you been to New York always?  Since 1985.  Since 1985.  God.  Ask him something that is educational.  What's your favorite food?  I don't know.  Oh.  Awesome.  Okay.  Who was the smartass that asked that fucking question?  Wait, what did he say, sir?  What was the question?  What did he say? 
[02:17:00]  I didn't hear it.  Something about smelling.  You want to smell?  This guy's feisty.  You want to smell a fruit in your face?  This guy's feisty.  Whoever some smartass was.  There could be some trouble.  Who said that?  Who said that?  I did that.  What did you say?  Paramedic.  Ask him when was the last time he didn't smell.  That would be a good question to ask.  How?  Well, we don't know about that.  Answer. 
[02:17:30]  When was the last time you didn't smell?  Oh.  Hey.  You're going to take that.  Oh.  Snap.  And then he walks away.  Slap you down.  Oh, wait.  See?  Oh.  That was a good one.  Oh, those are all 50s now.  Give me a five.  That was a good one.  Name tag off.  I have fives?  Yes.  What are you kidding?  I have fives made with zeros behind them.  But you stink.  You stink always.  That's my job.  You're all stinking people like you, so.  Oh, my God.  That's what I do.  What?  Yes, I know.  Paramedics.  Being an asshole? 
[02:18:00]  Being an asshole.  Being an asshole is.  Always being an asshole.  Paramedic versus homeless.  You smell.  That was a good question to ask.  A legitimate question to ask.  So what?  So what, what?  To what?  To what?  Nothing.  You keep me in business, so.  I've been.  As long as you stay stinky, I stay in business.  So don't worry about it.  I've been.  I've been.  I've been homeless since 85 years.  Oh, good for you.  Since 77, when I died in the 10th century.  Beautiful.  In the federal 10th century.  Explain to me why you're homeless.  If you've been in Nam, you was exposed. 
[02:18:30]  Why were you in jail?  In the Nam?  Excuse me?  Why were you in jail?  Ask the government that.  Oh, the government.  The CIA got you, huh?  No.  Who got you?  The army.  The army.  Okay, that's a legitimate.  I get that.  Ah.  You still stink, though.  You had to burn that village to save it.  It's okay, though.  I forgive you.  So if you was exposed to Gage and Orange, you would stink, too.  No, I'm exposed to you every day, so it doesn't matter.  See, he knows my face.  I'm taking him off the 100 times. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, you have?  I'm exposed to you every day, too.  Your mouth.  I know.  Your mouth stinks, just like you.  I know, but at least I got a job, so.  Ooh.  All right, I got him again.  There he goes.  He got you again, bro.  Two for the homeless guy, zero for the medic.  Jesus.  You want to pick on a crippled next?  Yeah, no kidding.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  What's your name?  Thank you.  Tony.  We'll see you this week, Tony.  Bye, Tony.  All right.  Tony, everybody.  We're going to get him to punch somebody.  Oh, that guy is so fucking angry, man. 
[02:19:30]  Actually, he's very surly.  He is angry.  We've run into him on 56th Street.  He yells at people as they go by.  Yeah, he yells at people, and they walk by, and if you don't give money, he throws things  at you.  What are you taking a picture of?  What is she taking a picture of?  Are you guys tourists?  We're on a radio show.  I am, right?  Are you guys tourists?  Yeah, we're from Australia.  Oh, you're from Australia?  Oh, sorry to hear.  How do you feel about what's happening?  Steve Irwin. 
[02:20:00]  Can you get me a man of heaven?  Yeah, I'm Steve Irwin.  Yeah, we feel very sorry for him.  He was a good ambassador for Australia.  Yes.  Roland, people from Australia.  That guy was great publicity for Australia.  You can help us out.  Yeah, we were trying to figure out some more famous people from Australia.  Australia, they're tourists here.  We only know Steve Irwin, the Croc Hunter, and who else?  Olivia Newton-John.  Olivia Newton-John.  Crocodile Dundee.  Crocodile Dundee.  And Mel Gibson.  There's no one else.  Nicole Kidman.  Well, Mel Gibson was born in the United States. 
[02:20:30]  Nicole Kidman.  Who was that, man?  Nicole Kidman.  Nicole Kidman.  Yeah.  That's a crow.  Layton Hughes is our best teller player at the moment.  We've got married, too.  See?  Yeah, star-studded them.  Roland, this is our friend Roland.  He has a question for you guys.  He wants to travel.  Roland does good questioning.  What's a good place to go to Australia?  What's a good place to visit there?  I know, Sydney.  It's the best country in the world.  I love it.  That's not very insightful. 
[02:21:00]  Ask an insightful question.  Let's go.  If you're going to make your daughter pair it with ours, it'll make it easier for us.  What?  You should give Australia a discount.  Yeah.  Okay, what do you think about that?  It's all very good.  Okay.  What do you think?  Ask something maybe you want to know about Australia that not many Americans know.  You said you didn't hear them, so why are you answering them?  I don't know.  What are you looking at?  I forget.  Why don't you stop looking at your BlackBerry?  Stop looking at your BlackBerry.  Stop being nervous.  And ask a nice question.  Ask a question.  They're a nice couple from Australia.  How long is a flight to Australia from here? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, my God.  You can find that out on the web.  About 20 hours.  Did you ask an insightful question?  You know John Travolta flies for them sometimes, the actor?  How creepy is that?  All right.  Well, enjoy New York.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys need a cab?  Do you need a cab or you got one?  All right.  Oh, there you go.  Gabby's like it when you call them savages.  You look like Edward Dorton.  You know that, right?  Beautiful.  Wow.  Did you see her? 
[02:22:00]  Beautiful.  Paramedic.  Really, it looks like my friend Edward.  By the way, make sure you don't get in trouble, paramedic dude.  Yeah, but they were filming everything today, so.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go up.  Oh, look at the potbelly.  Look at the hairdo on this zilch.  Jesus.  Hey, Phil Hartman.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at her tits in 80-year-old lady dress.  Look at Kenny's doppelganger coming down the, uh,  hi, how are you? 
[02:22:30]  Look at this chick's bunt.  Oh.  Nice camel toe, too.  I know.  Very good.  You have a very nice camel toe, man.  Nice camel toe.  Oh, Jesus.  Good morning.  Good morning.  What happened?  Good morning, sir.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  You got baggy pants to hide your saggy ass.  Good morning.  Say that to this guy.  Say something to him, Opie.  Yeah, come on, tough guy.  Yeah, say something to you, tough guy.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  You got muscles. 
[02:23:00]  Good morning, Mr. African American.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, look at, uh, look at Robert Klein, huh?  That's a nice dog.  Nice rat.  For a faggot.  That's what I was going to say.  For a homosexual.  All right.  Great dog.  All right.  When you weigh 60 pounds and it jumps on your chest, it won't break your ribs.  That's why they always have small dogs, so they can push them off if they're having trouble breathing. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Who's the homeless guy?  He's dead.  He's dead.  He's long dead.  He was very badly raped, you see.  It's a long walk today.  Yeah.  Sheets on that lady.  By the way, we have Big A back at XM.  He's redoing the Steve Irwin story.  Really?  As a newscaster.  We're going to throw it up on YouTube later this morning. 
[02:24:00]  Morning.  How are you?  Good.  Good to see you.  All the mullets.  Yeah, look at that English haircut.  Look at the size of these tits.  Holy crap.  An Asian with big tits.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Never seen that.  Ask her a question, Bob.  Ma'am, how are you?  Who at the radio show?  How does it feel to be an Asian with huge breasts?  What?  Why is she walking away?  Ma'am?  I never would have thought.  No, because most Asians...  Hello?  I wasn't trying to...  You know...  Forget it.  Oh, Bob. 
[02:24:30]  Go follow her flat ass and ask her why she's got such big tits.  Wow.  Wow.  She really got mad.  She was pissed.  She didn't know she was Asian.  I said breasts.  Maybe that's...  Oh, what the hell is this?  This looks like trouble.  You should have asked her if she likes to titty fluck.  Yeah.  What is this?  Could be trouble.  Look at the guts.  You know they're not buying a piano.  Good.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Huh? 
[02:25:00]  I'm full with them.  They're lesbians.  Excuse me.  They're dykes.  They'll beat the shit out of you.  Holy Jesus.  You guys all right?  All right.  I'll miss.  All right.  Hi.  We'll give them a free pass today.  That was too easy.  We have a free pass.  Really?  They'll beat the living shit out of you, those dykes.  They're going to get the shit kicked out of you by their family of dykes with their kid.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We had a nice crowd for the walkover today.  We're going to have sailor tattoos.  Second half of the show in minutes.  O.B.  Anthony.  XM 202. 
[02:25:30]  Mexican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes! 
[02:26:00]  Here it comes!  The O.B.  The Anthony program.  The O.B.  The O.B.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.B.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The O.B. 
[02:26:30]  And Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:27:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  God, I am so glad no one annoyed those lesbians out there.  They looked like a gang waiting for trouble.  Like waiting to pick on people.  But they were just three lesbians. 
[02:27:30]  Tattoos.  Big bellies.  Big fish belly, white bellies hanging over their jeans.  Dyke haircuts.  And just nasty looks.  That could have been a bad situation if one of us would have mouthed off to one of those  dykes out there.  You think?  Those tattoos weren't even real tattoos.  They got them out of fair.  Oh, all right, Mr. Brave Guy.  They got them out of a cookie crisp box this morning.  Hey, you said something to the big-titted China woman.  I'll fight all those dykes. 
[02:28:00]  Those dykes would have fucked you up.  Really?  They're not afraid to throw down the dykes.  Not afraid.  There's some story happened last week or something.  Where?  A microphone.  A guy got mouthed off, said something to a dyke, and a whole group of dykes beat the  shit out of them.  One of them stabbed them.  Really?  What was this?  I don't know, Australia.  No, really.  It was in New York City.  Where?  Right here where we reside.  They do have those gay gangs downtown.  Yeah, lesbians. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, those are times too.  And then they're so fucking like crazed.  You can't mouth off to them or call them, you know, hey, dyke.  They'll turn around and I'll beat the shit out of you.  Well, because, yeah, but they're young and they're not those.  That's white trash you were talking about downstairs.  They weren't lesbian gangs.  That was white trash.  They're like Popeye arms.  They smoke seven packs of cigarettes a day.  How long could the fight be?  A minute and a half before somebody's-  You're going to punch one in the face?  I'll go down right now.  Would you punch-  Like if she started a fight, because they'll punch you and kick you and pull your hair  and everything.  What are you going to do? 
[02:29:00]  Like haul off as hard as you can and belt them in the face?  You really can't knock any teeth out on them.  You're going to look bad.  No matter what you do.  You punch her in her mouth, she just takes her teeth out and throws them on the ground?  Let's go.  That's why the guy got in trouble.  That's why the guy got beat up and stabbed.  Why?  Because he can't throw.  You can't throw.  Why?  He wanted to-  Because it's a broad.  Oh, gives a shit.  What are you doing at that?  With that Italian macho code that you can't hit a broad.  It's not Italian macho.  More Italian-  Women and children.  More Italians are wife beaters than anybody, I think. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, that's your wife.  The shirt's named after it, for God's sake.  That's the beauty of the Italians.  That's the wife.  They don't be other women.  They hit their women.  Is that they hit their women.  Kenny told me a very funny domestic violence joke.  Oh, yeah?  Which I've heard-  Can he tell us?  In different forms, but the wording he used was very good.  All right, here's the club soda Kenny.  Kenny, just don't ask about monkeys again, please.  My young son wanted me to ask that question.  I happen to have my young son in the car.  Knocking down mailboxes. 
[02:30:00]  Do you want to set it up with the Attell joke that you told me?  Well, I don't want to use one of Attell's jokes on the air.  I was just telling you, because it was one of Dave's jokes I quoted to Kenny.  Right.  So, we were on the subject of domestic violence, and then I said to Jimmy,  what do you say to a woman who's got two black eyes?  Nothing.  She's already been spoken to twice.  Maybe you said it too fast this time.  Jesus, did you set him up?  Oh, you were an awful man, Jimmy.  I actually do like that joke, though. 
[02:30:30]  I know.  So did I when I heard it.  I never heard it like when he said spoken to twice is what made me laugh.  How funny.  When we got a couple Thanksgiving ago, I got a free turkey.  Smoothie?  Yes.  Parfait?  Please.  Yes.  I got a free turkey, and we got an extra turkey,  so we were bringing it over to the woman's battered shelter behind the apartment  with me and Jim Norton.  He goes, what did you say?  I said, I was bringing it to the woman's shelter, 
[02:31:00]  and Bob said something about, like, this is a nice thing we're doing,  and I said, yeah, I'm going to put my hand up and see I'll be back in three hours.  Don't overcook it.  You really ruin a nice moment.  Yeah, it takes a nice moment where you actually feel like you're doing something good.  Nice 18-pound turkey.  And just turn it into shit.  I wish Thanksgiving was coming up.  Here's the best prayer for Thanksgiving. 
[02:31:30]  You just go like this.  Fungus!  Amen.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Hey, Max.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Max, how you doing, Max?  Hey, Max, how are you?  Hey, Bob?  Yeah?  You're talking about fighting with these lesbians.  Why don't you wrestle with them like you did on Torgasm with that one guy,  you fucking flipperless manatee, you facket.  Ooh! 
[02:32:00]  Did he have to get...  He's laughing at himself.  I know, he got so fucking wordy because he knows he's not funny.  He's laughing at himself.  You flipperless manatee, fuckface, loose asshole shit.  I get it.  That's the right language.  Don't be so wordy.  Mike in Brooklyn.  Hey, Hope, what's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Get a mic.  I got another domestic violence joke for Jimmy.  Okay.  What do you tell the...  I'm sorry.  What does a battered wife do when she gets out of the hospital?  What?  The dishes, if she knows what's good for her.  Here we go. 
[02:32:30]  That's a hot one.  What else do I have?  Why don't I write down 61 million?  I don't know.  Somebody asked you about what you're making here?  It's balance.  That's your contract?  It's balance.  Yeah, but this is going to drive me nuts now.  61 million.  That's something we were talking about this morning.  Hmm.  I wrote it down as a thought starter.  61 million.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  Fan pointed it out?  Yeah, the Jerry Lewis, ah, MDA telephone. 
[02:33:00]  That no one's watching anymore.  No one watches it.  So why is he setting records every year?  They used to give the telethon massive amounts of time.  Whatever network it was on, he would call it the Love Network.  It was usually Channel 9 here in New York.  Some crap channel around the country, you know, would pick it up.  And they'd broadcast this thing.  And it seemed like it went on the entire weekend.  I think it did.  Didn't it go on for like three days, this telethon?  And Jerry would stay up and Ed McMahon was there. 
[02:33:30]  And there would be real celebrity guests.  And you always, I remember as a kid going over my grandmother's house and they'd all be watching.  It was an end of summer tradition.  It was like an event, yeah.  Every Labor Day.  During your, yeah, Labor Day, you would take a peek.  And you'd come back and there was Jerry.  I see what the number is, like, ooh.  Yeah, what's the tally up to?  The tote board.  And Jerry was awake.  Oh my God, he's been awake for so long.  Now it's on for like 45 minutes on one day.  And it's all corporate sponsorship, so I guess that's why they made so much money. 
[02:34:00]  I don't, are there any more individuals that give?  No, it's great.  No real.  The number flashing across the bottom.  No real celebrity wants to do it.  No.  There is not one real celebrity that does this.  Because they don't get the good exposure out of it.  So they're like, fuck the charity.  I don't get good exposure.  I'd rather do something else.  Is there an audience there or no?  Yeah, yeah.  This is all from, like, McDonald's and Disney and stuff.  They give these huge checks.  And they get bigger every year.  They're great tax write-offs for the corporation. 
[02:34:30]  You know when they started giving huge checks back in the day, they're thinking, all right,  you know, with all the support, this disease will be licked in 10 years.  We can deal with this.  10 years.  40 years later, they're like, oh, crap.  40 years.  We've got to send another check in this year.  1.4 billion.  Is that what the kid who won Last Comer Standing has?  No, he has multiple sclerosis.  Wait, wait.  He has CP.  He has cerebral palsy.  Cerebral, yeah.  No one you know has muscular dystrophy because you can't do anything.  Really?  You can't.  You know, there's something funny about that. 
[02:35:00]  It's like, no one knows anyone because you can't do anything.  You stay home and stare at the wall.  Night on the town.  You can crank into the tub.  No one knows.  Cranked out of the tub.  You'll never walk alone.  Oh, sorry.  No shit because you'll be dead.  The words.  Jerry Lewis is 80.  We did do it.  Said Lewis, 80, looking choked up as the final figure.  $61,013,850 flashed across the tote board Monday. 
[02:35:30]  That's all they made?  I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart for so many little people that can't  thank you, can't show their appreciation in any way.  Oh, yes, they can.  You hold that non-moving head, you give that mouth a fucking.  Oh, Jesus.  You're welcome.  Oh, my God.  He's doing a great thing.  What?  What the?  It's a little kid that has MS, so whatever the hell they have.  I didn't see him.  It's muscular dystrophy.  That, too.  MD, MD.  MD.  Oh, whatever.  MD.  There you go.  The guy's raised $1.4 billion, Jimmy.  Here, take a load on the face, old turnip root torso. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What's wrong with Jimmy?  The money goes toward a lot of different things now.  Yeah, to machines with lights.  We're going to make a hat to fit his fat head now.  He doesn't have a fat head.  Get your diseases right.  He has steroids shot in his head.  He got fat.  Everybody's not fat anymore.  Oh, Jerry did.  Oh, Jerry did.  Jerry did.  He doesn't have the MD, though.  I was talking about the little kids.  No.  By the way, there's God with a sense of humor.  Here's a guy who's spent the last 40 years of his life raising $1.4 billion. 
[02:36:30]  Let's make him suffer at the end of his life.  He just goes to show you what a huge prick he is when he's not doing this.  People can't understand him.  You don't think he's pocketing some of this money, though?  Trust me.  He's always been like one of those things.  Well, stories came out many years ago.  I don't know if it's still happening, but as far as giving money to charity, they used  to say that MD was the worst charity, one of the worst charities to give it to because  a lot of the money didn't go for the actual cause, not overhead.  Well, yeah.  Too much money.  Jerry had went to the overhead.  Jerry had from those little kids in the chair. 
[02:37:00]  Well, muscular dystrophy, you can actually become a coroner.  I remember there was a show.  Remember Quincy?  Yes.  Quincy M.D.  No, that's doctor, stupid.  I'm not harassing you.  No.  He had muscular dystrophy.  All right, listen.  I remember a commercial when I was a kid that was very scary as a kid because I've been  a hypochondriac my whole life.  No, really?  Yeah, I can't watch medical shows.  And I can't watch things like that because I always think I'll have that thing.  And it was a muscular dystrophy commercial when I was a kid. 
[02:37:30]  And you obviously think that you'll get a disease if you stop talking on national TV.  Hey!  Hey!  Whoa!  Where'd it come from?  I don't know.  I'm afraid the nodes would show up.  I don't want nodes.  I've got to keep talking, Dave.  I don't want nodes.  All right.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me back into this.  Back into this.  A little song.  A motion picture.  Oh, that's okay.  Next time we'll work on water, Helen Keller.  Water?  What does that mean?  What?  Remember the scene where you try... 
[02:38:00]  Okay, hold on.  Sorry no one ever watched the Helen Keller movie.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I jerk off the first five minutes and I'm done.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I saw a muscular dystrophy.  It was just a cute smash.  You can take it.  Johnny was a playful young boy.  And one day he fell down.  And then the next week he fell down again.  Then he couldn't get up.  And every time I tripped over my own feet or something, because you're a kid that's running 
[02:38:30]  You thought that was the first one.  I thought I had muscular dystrophy.  I swear to God, I've been a nut my whole life.  I can't watch medical shows.  Medical Center would be on and my mother would be watching that.  But it's actually you're thinking, well, the first one they give you.  It's when you do it the second time.  If you fall twice.  You fell the first time going, oh, my God, I can never fall again in my life.  I can't fall or else I'm going to be in the chair.  It's going to be the MD.  They're going to be pushing me out for the telethon in the wheelchair.  Very scary.  Do you die from MD or do you just fucking rot?  Oh, you die.  You rot from the spine out. 
[02:39:00]  It's bad.  Back in the day, I did a lot of work with MD when I was doing radio in Rochester.  And I was like a playmate for a lot of these kids.  A playmate?  Like you couldn't close off?  Did magazine shoots?  You show up with little bunny ears on and you lap your cock back?  Did you rub your ass on their non-feeling legs?  I think that's why.  Did you tell them what you liked?  I'm Opie.  I like strong men in wheelchairs.  I think that's why I'm bitter today because back in the day, I helped with DMD and made  a lot of dreams come true. 
[02:39:30]  They would want to come into the radio station.  I'd do the guys, show them around and show them how to do a radio show and stuff like  that.  And I would actually get to know them and I would go on these picnics and these excursions  and what have you to the stupid minor league game up there, the Rochester Red Wings at the  time.  And then you start feeling for these kids and next thing you know, little Johnny's not  around anymore and they have to tell you the bad news that he died.  I couldn't take it anymore.  And Opie would go, I couldn't take it.  How did it happen?  We are a darn day. 
[02:40:00]  You mean crooked arms dead?  I was just a part-time jock and they would look at me like it's the greatest thing that  has ever happened to them.  I'm like, I'm a nobody.  And then I start thinking about their lives and like, oh, and then they're just dying off.  You sure it wasn't when you got up and walked out of your chair, they weren't like  astounded at that?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that make you feel guilty?  He wasn't like, excuse me, I got to take a lick.  The older ones?  The older ones love to drink, man.  Do they?  Oh, they love to drink.  They admire that you could drink without spilling it on your chest.  Could they move at all? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But just like for the wheelchairs?  No, they're different stages.  Some could even, you know, do some of that walking.  Oh, my God.  I want to give to muscular dystrophy.  Let's get some of them in here and make them do tricks.  Are you a crazy man?  I want to help.  We want this job.  That's not helping.  You get like, how about there's a hula hoop, and you position one in front of it, and  you push them through it, and you yell, ta-da.  That is not.  Like, Chris Angel.  I couldn't handle it.  Are you ready?  Listen. 
[02:41:00]  I couldn't handle it anymore.  Hey, what is MD, anyways?  Exactly.  It's muscular dystrophy.  Okay, what is it?  What happens?  Your muscles wither away, pretty much.  You decide not to work for you anymore.  You just, they don't work, and they get atrophied, and then what happens, like your diaphragm,  which is a muscle, stops working.  And you pretty much can't breathe.  So they need things, like, hooked up, like Superman did?  Yeah, but then after a while, that doesn't do anything either.  Really?  It's over, Johnny.  And they got little, like, their arm will be the size of, like, your thumb. 
[02:41:30]  It's what they lift with.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Travis.  Travis has muscular dystrophy.  Travis?  Our own Travis.  And Sam has it, too.  Oh, no.  They have a manual dystrophy.  Travis.  I get to work without getting shot, boys, you know, down here in Houston.  What's that, buddy?  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get to work without getting shot.  You know, it's Houston, so.  Try it again.  I was watching the...  What do you mean, why do you get to work without getting... 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, you broke up there.  What did you open up?  I'm not sure what you're saying, bro.  I found it funny.  Who's shooting people in Houston?  What do you mean?  No one.  I'm just trying to get to work without getting shot.  Why?  Because it's Houston.  What's wrong with Houston?  What's wrong with Houston?  I was just there this weekend.  It was fine.  What's wrong with Houston?  Well, they get killed, too.  I saw you.  You were great.  Why do you get killed if you're in Houston?  Because there's a little town called New Orleans to the east of us who decided to dump  all their shit in our backyard.  You know what I mean?  Ooh. 
[02:42:30]  Anyways, what I was going to say was the telethon.  A Cheap Trick performed.  Real relevant.  What is this, 1975?  Cheap Trick, huh?  I don't think so.  Did he play the six guitars?  No.  Well, they had them out there for some ungodly reason.  He didn't even fucking touch them.  Did he throw it?  What did he sing?  They sang the fucking Do You Want Me To Want You.  I'm right already with that.  Did he throw out his guitar picks at the end?  Like a million of them?  I want you to walk.  He's terrible.  No.  I want you to want me. 
[02:43:00]  I got it.  Why would I?  Why would I have anything to say?  I want you to look at me.  Yeah.  And it is a cheap trick that God played on these poor children.  That is awful.  Surrender, but don't give your legs away.  Yay.  I got you to love me.  This is a lackluster performance.  Who did this?  The Muppets?  Is this the studio version? 
[02:43:30]  They usually hear the live from Japan version.  This is an M.  Who is this?  It is.  No, it isn't.  It's Robin Zander.  What is this, Derek?  I know it's cheap trick.  What version, though?  The Dream Police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Come on.  God, they have like two good songs, and the rest of it is dreck.  I'm going business over here.  All right.  So I'm just working at the 7-Eleven.  Hold on.  Congratulations to Jerry Lewis.  60 million.  Bobby, I didn't hear you. 
[02:44:00]  I said they have two good songs, and Dummy corrected me.  No, they had a couple good songs.  Oh, thanks for straightening me out.  A couple more than your two.  That makes four.  I said two.  You said couple.  I don't know how to say I know a few.  I know a couple, but I don't know how to say four.  Several.  How many?  Several good songs.  How many is a few, by the way?  Three.  That's what I think, too.  Three.  Most people say it's not, though.  It is.  It's three.  I like three.  I like three, too.  Yeah.  I take a few cookies.  I always go and take three.  You take three.  It's three. 
[02:44:30]  When they say take a few, I eat all of them, and then throw the crumbs on the muscular dystrophy  boy's chest and say, if you can pick him off, you can eat him.  Jesus.  What do you have against the poor children?  They're all faking it.  You know what?  Jimmy, why don't you talk to Shane?  His brother has muscular dystrophy.  Oh, no.  Let's talk to him.  Go ahead, Shane.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, dude.  How old is he?  How about educating him?  Why don't you educate Jim, man?  Dude, go ahead.  You talk.  Why would I have a question to ask? 
[02:45:00]  Just because I'm on the radio.  Go ahead.  You would know.  No, go ahead.  How old was he, is the question?  Oh.  I'm sorry about that.  How old was he?  How old was he?  Yeah.  He was 25 when he passed.  How old did he have it?  All his life.  Do you know when you were a kid that you had it?  I had it all his life.  He didn't know any better.  That's all right.  I'm born with it.  Huh?  You're born with it?  Like, did it start in then, or when you're older?  No.  Well, the payment started right away.  There's different kinds of muscular dystrophy. 
[02:45:30]  He had Becker's.  Can you catch it?  Can you catch it?  No.  Yeah.  You cannot catch it.  No.  If we could catch it, we'd be burning them.  We don't like.  Jesus.  That's how we are as people.  What the hell, King?  I'm just saying that's how we are as people.  If something was that devastating and you could catch it.  Like, if cancer, let's say.  Well, we just got to cure it and put them on an island.  We don't have to burn them.  Okay.  We have an island with lepers on it, don't we?  I'm just saying things like that, like cancer.  If that was contagious, forget about it. 
[02:46:00]  What do you think we'd be doing?  How bad was he when he died?  Burning people alive.  Could he move it all every Sunday?  Back like cord would.  Hey.  We're going to the burning this Sunday.  Yeah.  I say the next survivor should do it with M.D. kids.  What?  Survivor M.D. Island?  Survivor with M.D. kids and, well, I got the audio of the show.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Sir, you've got your scared faces in the dark.  Oh, that is not right. 
[02:46:30]  Trying to get their wheelchair out of the sand.  How come it seems like more guys have it than girls?  Well, it's, uh, well, it was Beckers.  It's, uh, 50-50 shot.  50-50 where it is.  I actually know why it is.  We kill the women.  We know where that is.  No, we don't.  We just put them in the hospital and the orderly just fucked them  so they don't report that they have it because the girls can't move or yell.  Jesus.  How bad?  Dude, when he passed away, was he unable to move completely?  No, he was able to move up until, uh, he put himself in a wheelchair at about 23. 
[02:47:00]  It's a brutal disease.  Wow.  That's awful.  All kidding aside, that disease stinks.  Yeah.  What disease doesn't stink?  I get it, but, I mean, that one is just...  Anything that your body turns on you like that is awful.  Eight.  Is Lou Gehrig's disease part of, uh, MD?  No.  No?  More of a nervous system.  That's why it's Lou Gehrig's, not Mercedes.  No, I know, but they added a...  They straightened you out.  That's a good point.  Wow, he really smashed you in the cheek.  I don't know, though. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe someone will back me up.  I think they threw that in the old MD category.  Get rolling in here.  There's a bunch of diseases that fall under the MD category.  Well, with them...  But you smashed me and it was good, so I say you're right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't go yet, dude.  Don't go yet.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah, everyone's been...  As opposed to good...  Uh, Timothy from Michigan.  The bad disease.  Hey, I have Gillette MD, and it's not as bad as some of the extreme cases you get.  What?  Gillette?  Yeah.  What's that when you can't quite get a good shave? 
[02:48:00]  You don't use the Mach 3 or the...  Keep missing the same damn spot?  Yeah.  You can learn a lot about it on eatabullet.com.  Motherfucker.  You're a good boy, even if you can't type properly.  All right.  You have to go back to the brother in a second here.  Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Good morning.  Good morning, Peter.  Hey, man.  Did you guys happen to catch Norm Crosby's stand-up routine on the telethon?  Oh, God, they drag Norm Crosby out.  Did we tape the MD telethon?  We should have. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, why didn't we tape it?  That would have been a biggie.  The talent segments on that are amazing.  Well, we've talked about Norm Crosby.  Everything from high school bands to the likes of Norm Crosby.  Wait, the old comedian.  Yeah, that is like death.  Bad joke.  That was death.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he plays off that he's death.  Did Jerry Lewis introduce him?  We got Norm Crosby.  Okay.  The Wicked Witch introduced him.  I want a picture with Jerry Lewis.  No, you don't. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I do.  That was an interesting exchange.  We just had...  You had nothing, and I had less.  You guys have a bunch of meisner technique.  You have a blue shirt.  I have a red shirt.  We're going to find Norm Crosby's set.  We suck.  We've got to get that before the end of the show.  Jeff and St. Louis.  What do you got?  Nothing.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Godspeed.  Jeff and St. Louis.  The only thing I remember about the Jerry Lewis telethon and my dad getting blubbering  drunk, acting like a fool, crying, because he saw the little kids come out, and then 
[02:49:30]  he donated a couple hundred bucks.  We have a crier in studio, Bob.  Do you watch the MD telethon?  I told you, kids and midgets and retards, those people, there's something about it that  makes me cry.  The sensitive way you put it, alone.  I swear to God, there's something about midgets and kids.  Anything with kids, I can't watch.  When they wheel the kid out at the end, the little girl, and she's in a dress, and it's  a little ruffled, because someone didn't put it on straight.  And she can't fix it.  You know, I've seen, I know exactly what you're talking about. 
[02:50:00]  They're in the wheelchair, and you'd think they'd straighten out the kid's clothes.  This is what I hate about it, though.  They make you suffer because the pledges are down.  So they have a whole bunch of these kids backstage, and they're like, you know, the pledges  are way down.  Let's get the biggest disaster out there immediately.  Why do midgets make you sad?  No, just because they're small.  They look like kids.  Because they look like kids.  They look like kids, and you know, they don't...  So when that little midget was getting proposed to, and she went, oh...  No, it made me cry. 
[02:50:30]  She couldn't touch her face to wipe the tears.  She had a little T-Rex arm.  She had to wipe her face on the tablecloth.  I wish I lived with it.  What I would do to wipe her tears is I would put a napkin on a flyswatter.  And I would...  And I would...  Just occasionally lean over.  Smack her in the head.  Yeah.  I see a little drip.  They really do.  They really do.  Those poor kids.  They're in the chair.  Their mothers are nervous.  It's very sad. 
[02:51:00]  A little white...  A little blue dress with a white collar.  It is sad.  What are you doing?  I asked the family.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Alabama, Mike.  Hey there, Mike.  I be done it.  Ooby, Ooby, do!  All right.  A little dream catcher line.  Is that what he's doing?  See, thank you.  Thank you, Andy in Jersey.  I don't want to look stupid all the time.  Yes, Andy.  You just can't help it, though.  I know.  Listen, my pop passed away about a year ago from ALS. 
[02:51:30]  I'm not looking for your sympathy, but they are finding lately with research that there  are actually connections between a number of these neuromuscular diseases.  Dr. Ooby.  Thank you, sir.  I know.  I'm sorry, sir.  Not a problem.  Well, it's a connection just because it's a muscle disease.  Sorry about your loss, sir.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Sorry about your loss.  So, Jerry Lewis doing a good thing.  It's $60.5 million there.  He has raised a lot.  Have they gotten any progress on it or no?  I mean, is there any progress?  Or is it just, can they make their lives more comfortable?  Nothing. 
[02:52:00]  They've done things where they isolate certain types and know different things.  They've educated themselves more on it, but the kids are still in wheelchairs.  I bet you with stem cell research you can do something.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something that was amazing that I heard in the medical forum over the weekend.  There's a family plagued by colon cancer.  Everybody in this family winds up getting colon cancer.  So, the husband and his wife want to have kids, but they know they're pretty much condemned to death.  So, they took an egg out of the woman and sperm and a little Petri dish. 
[02:52:30]  They put them together and then they check it.  And they check for the DNA marker that shows colon cancer.  Wow.  And when they find one, that gets thrown away.  And they keep doing it and doing it.  And then they found one without that marker.  And they put it in her uterus and grows into a baby that doesn't have to worry about getting it.  That's how the diseases are going to be cured.  Not by, you know.  Did they do that?  Yeah.  How great would it be if the kid had Down syndrome? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, he didn't have colon cancer.  He had a perfect asshole.  And he's shitting himself with it every day.  But his mother has to wipe it every day.  He had a perfect asshole and he also talked like one.  Mama wiping my asshole with no lumps.  Clean as a whistle.  Woo-hoo.  Because he knew the whole family had it.  He was private.  He would always wear like clear back jeans like Cher Warren MTV that time to show off his cancer-free asshole.  Yell at his perfect sister, your asshole had bumped on him. 
[02:53:30]  My asshole clean.  Yeah, well, I can speak.  You want to like move on.  This is too depressing.  Lisa has a bumpy asshole.  No, because that's amazing.  That type of thing that's going to, that's the way diseases get cured.  Yeah, you're right.  Not by like all of a sudden the doctor's going to go, oh, we have this shot that we give you and you don't have cancer anymore.  And that's going to be in generations.  So you're basically saying that like through genetic selection, which was kind of like blonde hair, blue eyes in the 40s.  If you want to choose what your kids look like, if you want blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful children, you could do that too. 
[02:54:00]  You'll look for the genetic markers and then you eliminate the weak.  A pair of leather boots, a knife, a nice little youth knife.  You eliminate the undesirables, things like that.  By the way, they're already doing that in China.  Are they?  Chinese are coming.  What?  Well, we all know that.  They're going to defeat us in a generation from now.  One generation, that's it?  Yeah, because they're building their army right now.  They're like aphids.  An army of sharpened bamboo sticks.  Let's say hi to you.  I think it's a little more than just a generation. 
[02:54:30]  Tom and PA.  That took long enough, Kenny.  Tom?  Jesus Christ.  What's going on, boys?  I'm kidding.  Kenny's not in a good mood today.  Kenny, what's wrong?  Nothing.  He's right.  It did take me long, and I'm sorry.  No, that's okay.  I'm kidding.  Here come the emails.  If it took all day, it would be okay.  Here come the emails.  Why are you in a good mood?  You know I kid because I love.  Kenny, did you condition yourself, right?  I know, I know.  Not one, not two, maybe three emails explaining, I'm sorry.  Your smoothie took so long.  It will never happen again. 
[02:55:00]  What's the matter, Kenny?  You're not in a good mood.  You're going to go down and shoot the guy.  I was going to write an email about it.  I'm sorry that I made everyone think that I was in a bad mood.  The whole gay marriage thing.  It takes down the show.  That's cool.  Let's just sit there for a week and a half so I can let my banana ripen.  That is a green banana.  Ew, no.  Feels like a muscular dystrophy arm.  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  Jerry Lewis did a good thing for the people.  Yeah.  I know he did.  And I used to help out.  I would help sick kids.  They make me too sad.  That's self-centered.  I don't know how people do that.  You ever throw poker chips at a little kid in a wheelchair?  You bleeding deacon.  Fucking Christ.  You fucking poured blood on a fucking homeless lady a week ago.  Fucking cocksucker.  What? 
[02:56:00]  I used to have a heart.  I used to have a good heart.  What happened?  Can I ask you a question?  The kids were dying.  It pissed me off.  So the kids dying actually made you what you wanted today?  I didn't see one kid get anything good out of the telethon and it really frustrated the  hell out of me.  Did you really think they were going to get up someday and give you a hug?  Maybe not up.  Go to a strip club with you?  Maybe get something out of it.  Nothing?  They got death.  I didn't see it.  I was involved.  You got hardened like the guys in NAMM when the newbies are coming.  You don't want to talk to them. 
[02:56:30]  You don't want to meet them.  The whole time I was in Rochester, I helped out here and there.  So it was about three years off and on.  I saw nothing going on.  Wait, does anybody have a saw?  I got to cut through this fucking banana peel.  All right, we're on.  Holy Christ.  We're going to have the Norm Crosby audio after the break.  But first, we got Tom and PA.  Tom?  Hey there, Tom.  Hey, boy.  What's going on?  Welcome aboard, Tom.  An ultimate example of getting kicked in the face.  I got an aunt that has MS and then two of her three kids have MD. 
[02:57:00]  Are you kidding?  Hold on, not yet, not yet.  And they just found black mold in their house, the deadly black mold.  So they're homeless, had to get rid of all their possessions.  And I called into the MDA to ask them if they can do something special because they're  doing the whole money raising.  And they told me that they already got projects scheduled and they don't do that.  So three kids, two with the MD, right?  Which two?  The first two?  No, the first and last.  I thought you skated. 
[02:57:30]  How old are they?  I thought she skated.  Five, seven, and nine.  So everybody's just.  Oh, shut up.  What a wreck.  Everyone's sick.  Boy, I want a sick house.  Boy, I want to be there for Christmas.  Yeah, what's a black mold?  Duh.  What is that?  Black mold.  That's that deadly mold that's in the house that gets in the walls and all that stuff.  I live in a doorman building, sir.  It'll kill you.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Bob lives in a luxury apartment, sir.  A luxury apartment with my friend Jimmy lives in another luxury apartment.  We don't have mold, rats, or cockroaches. 
[02:58:00]  No, we don't have molds.  Why would there be a mold in my apartment?  It's mold, Bob.  Mold.  Sorry.  You know when things get moldy?  Oh, I don't know.  What is it?  Mold?  Yeah, mold.  What is black mold?  It's black, fuzzy stuff that grows on the walls.  It grows on the walls.  It's a fungus.  Really?  Yeah, it's a fungus.  What does it give you?  It gives you a respiratory illness.  Tom, thank you.  Good luck to that family.  I don't know.  How old are you?  Are you five with that drink?  That must be nice.  A little apple juice with a straw?  I thought we were having nap time after the show. 
[02:58:30]  How do you wrap crutches so they don't look like crutches?  Under the tree, just four of them.  Are they two squirt guns?  No.  Attach your remote control?  Same thing you got last year.  He thinks they're two paintball guns?  No.  Why is my remote control attached to those sticks?  Let's tell the kids with cancer story again.  Oh, no.  Talking about changing my outlook on life.  What?  It's a legendary Opie and Anthony story from our Boston days. 
[02:59:00]  What happened?  When we had to do something.  You've never heard of this?  No.  It's worth telling them.  We had to do something nice.  Well, when we did the mayor's prank, the stupid station was hoping they could save our jobs.  So they hired a PR firm.  And the PR firm got this idea, public relations obviously, they got this idea that there should  be a photo op with Aunt and I with cancer kids.  Giving them like pies.  Was it pies?  Oh, yeah.  It was the pies that they wanted.  Because the pies.  Right.  See, you know what?  Their first thought at fixing this problem was to have Mayor Menino, after we said he was 
[02:59:30]  dead, throw pies at our faces as we were in stocks in the middle of like Samuel Hall  or something.  Pretty much the mayor wanted us to kill.  The mayor said, go fuck yourself.  I'm not joining in some bid.  We didn't even, we never agreed to this.  It was the ridiculous Dave Dickless program director, asshole, that thought this up.  And we got on the air when we heard and said, no, we're not fucking doing this.  They had already bought like fucking thousand pies that were supposed to be thrown at us. 
[03:00:00]  So now, plan B.  You know, Mayor Menino with his retard arm couldn't hit you.  That's the only reason.  But those pies look tasty.  But to think that the mayor would actually go for this.  That the mayor would go for this.  We'd be in stocks or whatever and he would throw pies at us.  He wanted us fired, you know, not a game being played for publicity or some bullshit.  So they have all these pies.  Now, plan B, what do you do with the fucking pies?  So the PR firm comes up with this one. 
[03:00:30]  Got a great idea.  Yeah, let's go down to the children's hospital and take all these pies down here.  And Opie and Anthony can present the children with some pies and snap pictures with them.  And we were walking around like zombies.  Because this was after all hell broke loose.  So I guess we got to admit to people that we kind of went down there to the children's hospital with the kids with cancer.  I guess not really thinking like, all right, yeah, all right, whatever.  But as we...  First of all, didn't even know they were cancer kids.  Are you sure?  Yeah, we were just supposed to be going to a kids' hospital. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, kids' hospital.  I don't know what the fuck it was.  Yeah, but you hear kids' hospital.  Maybe it's the...  Eh, you know, little Jimmy's got his arm in a sling.  Right, man.  That's all I wanted to see.  Maybe it's the kids' hospital where the kid has to get his tonsils out.  That's right.  Ice cream for everybody.  You feed him a little ice cream.  The kid's got mono.  He's going home tomorrow.  Right.  Exactly.  Little Connor's got seaweed in his hair.  Oh, my God, you ass.  So...  So, Ann is...  I guess Ann is right, because we never... 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, you know, you are right, because little JonBenet's got a sore throat.  And a sore hiney.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Check, please.  So, uh, we go there.  Oh, no.  And they send a...  Little Adam has a headache.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, dude, it's...  Oh, my God.  So, uh, we go there, and the pies are dropped off on pallets.  There's...  How many were there?  A hundred pies or something? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, there's something like a hundred.  A hundred pies.  And the photog is there.  Were they, were they, like, kids' pies, or were they, like, adult...  No, they were stupid boxed apple pies.  No.  Oh, were they?  Weren't they prop pies?  With a lot of cream on top.  Yeah, because, you know, you don't want to get...  You really don't want to get hit with...  It was just cream.  It was shaving cream in a pie tin.  You don't want drama.  Because you really don't want to get hit with...  Horrible.  You hear about people getting hit in the face with pies all the time. 
[03:02:30]  You really don't want to.  Not a real pie, yeah.  It's not a real pie.  It would hurt.  So, I think it was even prop pies.  So, we're there.  It's good.  The kid has no hope.  He's going to die, and then you give him a pie with nothing in it.  That's good.  Thanks.  I like to digest this, anyway.  So, we're in the lobby.  We're in the lobby, and the kids are taking forever to join us.  So, we can handle the pies.  A few of them came down pretty quickly.  God forbid there's not enough room in the elevator for the kids.  A few came down quickly. 
[03:03:00]  A couple of the other ones took a little longer.  But then we had to wait for one kid.  Little Jimmy, I want to say.  I don't know what his name was.  So, they're starting to gather in the lobby.  The pies are there, looking pretty impressive.  A nice little pyramid, and the photog is there.  And we're like, what the hell?  And then, as you see the kids slowly arriving, the longer it took, the worse off they were.  The worse it was.  So, by the time that last kid went to her, and they were waiting, because it was one  kid, I remember.  And it took so much longer than any of the other ones for one. 
[03:03:30]  They did say, because they did say something like, we're waiting for Timmy or Jimmy or whatever.  Because his equipment, they got to bring it to him.  What could be wrong with Timmy or Jimmy?  Here comes Captain Christopher Pike from Star Trek, and that thing, beep, beep, beep twice  for yes and once for no.  He's in some kind of contraption that they, like, roll him in, and there's pumps and things.  And now I'm thinking, I'm going to catch something.  I'm going to fucking catch something.  See, I didn't know about this back in the day. 
[03:04:00]  You always had this?  Oh, I hate hospitals.  I had no idea.  Hello, Opie and Anthony.  I discovered black holes.  Hello.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So here's the punchline.  I sure do love deep eyes.  Here's the punchline.  Pies are there.  Kids are there.  Photog is getting ready to set up the shot.  And one of the workers at this hospital goes, I'm making up the names because I forgot their  names, but Cindy, why don't you sing everybody a little song? 
[03:04:30]  Cindy had an angelic voice.  Oh.  And she started singing, was it Silent Night?  Cute as a button.  It was Silent Night.  She started singing Silent Night.  And the kids start joining in.  Oh.  I'm looking at Anthony.  Anthony's looking at me.  We're getting confused because it's April.  She looked like the little girl from Whoville.  Yeah.  She looked like little, what, Cindy Lou Who.  Please tell me that while they were singing, you took pies and threw it in their dumb faces.  And Anthony fucking hope he goes, it's April.  It's April. 
[03:05:00]  Because we're like, why?  How many songs does she know?  Yeah, but I'm sure she knows kids' songs.  There's a reason.  This is the punchline.  So there she's singing our little heart out and everyone is joining in.  And I'm looking like, this is really nice, but it's April.  What the fuck?  At that point, a lady leans over to me and goes, you know, Cindy isn't going to make it  to Christmas.  Sing them in April, kid.  Christmas in April.  Christmas in April.  At that point, I go, holy shit. 
[03:05:30]  What did we get ourselves into?  And then Aunt and I start singing through them all.  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Thanksgiving songs.  She's going to combine the songs.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  We know.  Yeah, Merry Christmas.  You're not going to be eight.  You're not going to be nine.  You're not going to be ten.  You're not going to be 11.  How old aren't you?  Yeah, that was.  So at that point, not that we need to pat ourselves on the back.  We actually went right at the photographer and said, you take one fucking picture. 
[03:06:00]  You know, there's going to be a problem.  This is over.  So we called up the stage and said, go fuck yourself.  This ain't happening either.  We left and they got all pissed at us.  I'm like, tough shit.  You should have taken the pies too from those bad boys and girls.  Yeah.  No pies for you.  No pies for you.  April.  April.  That's right.  You're going to be.  On the children?  On the children.  A little Silent Night rendition.  Oh, how depressing.  So this girl was real.  All these gay kids were going to die. 
[03:06:30]  They brought the worst of the worst.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Some of them, obviously.  I'm sure some would have made it through.  Did they eat the pies?  I don't know.  If you're singing Silent Night in April, you're not doing good.  And you're going to eat every single pie.  I didn't stick around.  You're not fat smashing.  Looking for a surgical mask to put on.  What, you thought you were going to get some kid disease?  Who knows?  Ow.  Get the measles.  Get the mumps.  All right.  Let's step aside. 
[03:07:00]  We got to take a break.  We've been talking for like over an hour straight here.  We got lots to do.  Jesus H. Christ.  Language.  Um, is the video done?  Uh, no.  Maybe?  Uh, no?  I don't think so.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice. 
[03:07:30]  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations. 
[03:08:00]  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big kids showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources, Attempts to Talk About Sensitivity Training. 
[03:08:30]  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks  outdoor.  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  You're such an ass.  Ah, yes. 
[03:09:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Bob, what are we promoting today?  I'm going to be at the venue in Gainesville, Florida.  Friday night.  Me and Jay Davis.  Yeah, that's great.  Flying to Philly Saturday.  I actually got a letter, an email from the guy.  What'd you say?  Flying to Philly Saturday for the show.  Right after the show, I'm going right to Philly to do the unbelievable show we're doing  with you guys.  They wanted me to fly.  They wanted Jay Davis to come out on a Harley Davidson and then for me to come out on a  scooter. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  How's that sound?  A scooter, dude.  Yeah, dude.  So did you be the Harley guy?  That was the whole funny part about it, though, is that Jay comes out on the Harley and I  come out on a little scooter.  Who came up with it, Jay?  No, the promoter.  What are you looking at, Ope?  Jimmy came up with a great bit that I will guarantee is going to just go viral on the  internet.  We got Big A sitting in front of a big Opey and Anthony sign doing the Steve Irwin death  story.  A goddamn Steve Irwin death story. 
[03:10:00]  He's just doing that story.  It should have taken him 15 seconds.  The video's two minutes long.  And he's tapping and he's blinking.  Look at this, Ant.  He's a wreck.  He's a wreck.  Oh, look at him.  It's up on OpenHouse.com.  Oh, how creepy.  Looks like he's delivering some white power speech.  He looks like Fat Hitler.  He's mustacheless Fat Hitler.  Now, this is the beginning of the bit.  Jimmy came up with it.  What we're going to do is we're going to have Big A dressed as a newsman and we're going  to have news and all that and when a big story hits, we're going to have him do it and then 
[03:10:30]  we're going to throw it up on the website.  It'll go to YouTube.  This thing will be downloaded a lot.  He's actually going to have cue cards, too.  We're going to have a producer, a woman holding cue cards for him so he can read it like a  real newscast.  You should have a scroll.  Shut up.  Let me tell you something.  I was just going to say, ticker goes on the bottom.  Get that fucking Foundry logo off of there.  I love you, Steve, but Jesus H. Christ, have a ticker on the bottom with the Foundry Opey and  Anthony thing so it looks more news-like. 
[03:11:00]  Have real information like the virus tour info.  Yeah, it could be virus tour and then that for the length of it.  That way it looks like a broadcast.  Now it looks silly because it's got fucking...  I came up with that.  It looks like a music.  I came up with that.  I was going to say it.  I said it first.  I'm going to sting you in the heart.  Every bit has to start somewhere.  This is a great start right here.  Yes.  It really is a great start.  My idea was to...  A ticker.  And you could say random stuff in it like, you know, hey girl, show your boobs right  now, whore.  And that would just go by people. 
[03:11:30]  What did that just say?  See, now that's silly.  Why would we do that?  The other thing is we have to have a live audience when he does this because he wasn't  as nervous doing it by himself.  Or Jimmy has a suggestion for that.  I think we should...  I know a woman who does some producing and I think she should be holding cue cards and  stuff like that and he should be at a desk in a suit and tie.  Here we go.  And the girl with the cue cards is naked.  Here's the story.  The girl is very scantily clad.  Cue cards.  No copy.  That way he can't pre-read it and doesn't really know what's coming until the card swings 
[03:12:00]  around.  And he doesn't have to keep looking down.  He gets to look right at it.  And he's...  He's totally fucked.  And maybe sitting made him too comfortable.  Maybe he should be forced to stand.  Maybe that was a bad idea I had with Newsday.  No, the sitting's great.  You know what they do on CNN though?  They have him sit in a high chair and, you know, he's sitting.  But there's no desk.  It almost looks like, you know...  We read the story already too.  We got the audio.  Here it is.  He was kind of onto it.  I still think it works.  Listen.  Good morning. 
[03:12:30]  It's time...  Oh, good morning.  It's time for the news again with me, Big A.  Starting today with some tragic news.  Steve Irwin, better known as the Crocodile Hunter, who died yesterday after being...  I asked Ping Ray off the coast of Australia. 
[03:13:00]  Steve's life was hot when Ping Ray Bob pierced his...  Him...  I was... 
[03:13:30]  I was...  I was tapping his heart.  He came over the top of a...  Of a...  Ping Ray...  I was buried in the sand.  And then the barb came up and stuck him in the chest. He said, John Payton, he's longtime manager. 
[03:14:00]  That's the news for today. I'm Big A and I was staring at me and caught your day. 
[03:14:30]  It works.  Yes, that was him relaxed?  Yeah.  That gives me a headache.  I get a headache every time I listen to that.  From now on, the audio is final. This is Big A with Opie and Anthony News, just in case people start passing around audio of that.  The names got to be mentioned in the final thing.  You're good with your marketing. You're good.  You're good.  Because people won't know. They'll hear it. They'll go, this guy's murderable. Who is he?  Murderable. 
[03:15:00]  And you should put at the end like a shwo-wo-ping Opie and Anthony News.  Yeah, like news alert.  Yeah, like a news alert.  I like that.  Can we hit him with a mallet at the end?  No, because I'm afraid if we do that, all of a sudden he'll lose his stutter.  What happened with the kids and the pie?  How do you go from the Rochester Red Wings, taking a whole bushel of them to a nice minor league game, to wanting to smash a retardant?  I don't want to feel for anything ever again.  You know what you should have done?  They end up dying.  The girl who was singing Silent Night, you should have cut her a big piece of apple pie. 
[03:15:30]  And once you went to grab it, you should have taken it back and said, none for you.  You're going to be dead.  Oh, let's go to Jerry in Texas.  You're bad.  Jerry.  Jim.  Jerry.  Thank you for your show Thursday night.  Oh, thank you.  Man, too bad you didn't go with me and Sam to the titty bar, but oh well.  I was tired, man.  Dallas and probably great.  And thank you for selling me a CD that didn't work.  What's that?  My, uh, your Yellow Treat CD?  Yellow Discipline. 
[03:16:00]  Yellow Discipline.  Nothing.  Really?  Anything.  Yeah.  No big deal.  Nah, Jimmy says go fuck yourself.  Mail it back.  I'll send you another one.  Believe me, you missed nothing.  It's awful.  I'll keep it.  No, but I would definitely have you to mail it back.  That might have just been a glitch, obviously.  Once in a while, that will happen.  You just send me my $500 for MySpace and we're fine.  I do.  I already mailed yours out.  Sometimes, though, on robertkellylive.com, MyCD that you can buy there, or at MySpace,  slash robertkellylive, you can get my CD there.  My CDs sometimes don't work, too, but I mail them back to robertkellylive.com. 
[03:16:30]  Well, hey, Tim, thanks for sending Wolverine into an asthmatic fit and out in an ambulance  during your show.  Oh, yeah, we need an update on that, Jimmy.  I don't know if he lived or died.  Once the moment was gone, fuck him.  What happened?  I don't know.  There was a guy who had an asthma attack during my show.  I was fucking killing.  And the smoke was bugging him.  And I came out after he was on a stretcher.  They're pumping breath into him.  Couldn't breathe.  How long did you do on the show?  It didn't matter, because there was standing room only, so someone got to sit.  Was it standing room only at the Dallas Improv? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And that's a weird setup, because it's short, and then it goes long to the left.  Long to the left.  It's a pretty big...  Yeah.  Actually, it does.  I've been there.  Yeah, it's short and long to the left.  Long into the left.  There was a mission at the show, too.  Long into the left.  Yeah, we heard you, sir.  All right.  That's good.  Long...  All right, why don't we move on to some material.  Yeah, let's move on to some stuff.  We got Bill Bonds.  He's a terrific guy.  Who is he?  He's a 70s news anchor.  Yeah.  What makes this interesting is Bill Bonds does a news tease. 
[03:17:30]  We love news teases, right?  Sure, sure.  So he does a news tease, and he objects to the fact that he had to do a news tease, so  he starts cursing about it.  This is when?  Back in the 70s.  Oh.  Back in the 70s.  And because we like the news teases, this might be good.  This is like a classic.  Well, do we pre-screen it?  Yeah.  Than?  Good?  Oh.  Uh, yes.  Of course.  Just saying yes.  Not saying someone said it was funny, or someone brought it in. 
[03:18:00]  He gets angry.  He gets angry.  All right.  We like anger.  All right.  This is Bill Bonds.  We keep reporting that the economy is improving, but the long lines for new jobs are still  forming in this metropolitan Detroit area today.  Hundreds of people are expected to apply for car selling positions with Ford dealers.  Also today, some poor people in Detroit are without a place to go.  Tough shit. 
[03:18:30]  What the fuck does that mean?  What the fuck?  Kill this fucking thing.  Oh, come on, Bill.  Let me get it.  I can't.  Well, I don't know what it means.  What the fuck does it mean?  I'll put out a place to go.  Fuck them.  Let them go hungry.  Come to your place.  What does all this...  What do those two fucking things mean?  What the fuck does that mean?  Tell them to go down.  If they're fucking short, tell them to go up.  What the fuck do those two first things mean?  No place to live. 
[03:19:00]  I would assume that's what they mean.  No place to live.  Tim Fritz finds out what's been done to give them shelter.  Oh.  Jesus fucking H.  Christ, what the fuck is wrong with a short declarative sentence?  Like, good evening, I'm Bill Bonds.  Nothing is new.  Good night.  That's the key, Bert.  You ready, Bill?  Yeah, I'm ready.  I will, but I want to make my weightless is over with before we straighten it.  Because we have to straighten it again.  You all set, Bill?  Yeah, I'm all set. 
[03:19:30]  God damn it.  I could write this whole fucking thing in eight minutes.  Oh, jeez.  I love Bill Bonds.  That guy rules.  I want to have a channel and have him doing the news, like, as himself.  Fuck him.  Well, today a bunch of fucking Asians did this.  What else is new?  Stick your head out the window.  That was good.  I like that.  Remember that movie?  No.  Oh.  Oh, Network.  I'm sorry.  He didn't say it like that. 
[03:20:00]  I want you.  I'm as mad as hell.  And I'm not going to take this anymore.  You can't head out the window and scream it.  A shopkeeper keeps a gun under the deck.  This fucking guy was great.  Peter Finch won the Oscar for that.  It was great.  That's one of the best monologues ever.  Yeah, it was great.  It doesn't hold up as much because now we're used to reality shows and all that stuff.  This was way before everything got nuts on TV.  It's just great.  I saw recently.  I was like, I wasn't as impressed as I was back in the day.  It's an amazing foreshadowing. 
[03:20:30]  Absolutely.  That's the beautiful thing.  Chayefsky was a great statement on what garbage television was.  And he saw this 25 years ago.  Yep.  You know what they're putting out a couple of days, I guess?  Star Wars DVD.  The original one you saw in the theater.  Okay.  Nothing like that.  Now, the original one you saw in the theater when it first came out in 1977, because that's  what people have been clamoring about.  He hasn't released this on DVD.  Well, I went to a site that showed all, I believe, 175 changes, scene by scene, every 
[03:21:00]  single change that was done.  Everyone remembers the ridiculous parts like Han Solo didn't shoot first in the scene with  the Garrido in the bar, a lot of extra CGI animals in the scenes and things like that.  And people said he should have left it alone.  You know, Lucas shouldn't have screwed with the original movie.  When you look at every single thing that was dealt with, thank God he did that. 
[03:21:30]  And you are going to see the crappiest shit movie that Star Wars really was.  Oh, so all the mistakes are going to be in it.  Yeah.  It's the original one that was shown in the theaters on DVD.  All right.  I misunderstood you.  So there's another version that came out.  It was the original movie, but all the corrections he made.  But all the corrections that he made and little additions and stuff.  But the things that work, that are going to be taken out, remember, I remember watching 
[03:22:00]  Star Wars and seeing when the Imperial ships were cruising around, you'd see squares around  them because the background was a different color.  They got rid of those in the remake.  And then the land speeder, the hovering land speeder, had hand-drawn shadows frame by frame  underneath that real thick.  They weren't transparent.  Looked like shit.  They added in horizons, like they raised up the shot, added in beautiful horizons to 
[03:22:30]  make the scene look bigger, not make it look as cheap.  And all this is going to be taken out now.  Now people are going to see Star Wars for what it really was back in 77.  How cool is that?  A crappy looking movie.  No, but you didn't know back then.  You didn't know.  But the thing is, with the advances in technology, he was able to fix those things.  Back then, you were like, holy crap, look how good this is.  They showed the security, remember the security tunnel when they were saving Princess Leia?  Security tunnel only went a few feet. 
[03:23:00]  And then at the end of it was a painting of the rest of the tunnel.  That was good if the camera was lined up perfectly.  But when they went side to side, you saw it was a painting hanging at the end of this  short tunnel.  They increased it digitally.  In the theater, though, Ant, did you see those squares around the big ships?  You always saw, in any science fiction, Battlestar, Galactica, Star Trek, you always saw the  square, because whenever they'd add...  But in the theater, you wouldn't.  Yeah, you would.  On the big, big screen. 
[03:23:30]  You absolutely did.  Really?  Yeah.  Optically, when you're doing optical piling, when you're just piling up things and it's  not digitally, it's done with real film and you're just piling up scene after scene,  you can't match the backgrounds.  So digitally, you can do that.  Where'd you find the comparisons?  Online?  It was on FARC.  I'll give FARC.com credit.  And then you scroll down a couple of days ago and you'll have the link and look at every  scene.  And just the color correction they did on it and taking out the graininess of certain 
[03:24:00]  shots.  It was amazing.  And believe me, on DVD, you're going to notice all those mistakes even more.  When's it coming out?  September 12th.  How many versions of the first movie now out on DVD?  There's, on DVD, I think just two.  Two versions.  And then they had to sync some other stuff up so it looks the same as the later movies.  Like the hangar deck on the Death Star looked different in the first movie, so they changed  that around.  Looked different, Bob.  It looked different. 
[03:24:30]  Well, those are for the real geek nerds.  Can I be honest, though?  Are you really into Star Wars?  Yes.  Let's answer this question.  Do you have a figurine?  No, I don't have any.  Do you have a lightsaber?  Um, no, I don't have a lightsaber.  Do you have a life-size Yoda in your apartment, in your house?  No, I don't.  No, okay.  I did make a video clip of me with a lightsaber.  All right.  No, that's a...  Did you really?  Yeah.  I found out how to do it digitally and made myself swing it out.  I just, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  I took, like, a broom handle and swung it around a few times and then put lightsaber thing  and sound.  Having a full-time job doesn't cut it for you, huh?  I didn't have one at the time.  It was during the two years I was off.  All right.  If you had a little problem with the church, you might have heard of it.  And as far as a life-size fucking Yoda, in his house, you can have a life-size Death  Star, he's a millionaire.  Hey, get rolling.  Rolling!  Do you have a big house, Ant?  Holy shit.  Well, you know.  If he wants to talk to his chick, he's going to talk on an intercom because she's so far 
[03:25:30]  close to the other side of the house.  Of course it is.  Ant, I'm hungry.  Over.  All right, honey.  I'll be right down.  I'm playing Jet Stop here with a friend of mine.  It's like, could you grab a bottle of water and just bring it upstairs?  Over.  Okay.  I'll be right up.  Over and out.  An intercom.  And then the front door.  It's not just the doorbell.  It rings and then you hear and you can go, who is it?  And then they go, we're collecting money for the, sorry, we don't want any. 
[03:26:00]  You don't even have to look people in the face now when you refuse them at the front  door.  Away.  Away.  Colin from Florida.  Original version.  You can see the strings on the ships hanging down, right?  I certainly don't remember that.  Let's ask Colin.  Colin?  I didn't see that in any of the snopsies.  Colin?  Yeah.  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Colin?  I just wanted to say in the unaltered original version of Star Wars, you can see the string  that holds up the Death Star as it blows up.  Oh, he just blasted his own Death Star. 
[03:26:30]  God, that was a, that was like a weird flop.  I felt a great disturbance in the force.  As if, as if eight people cried out with a smell.  That sounded like somebody stirring dinty more beef stew.  A big bubble coming up when it just starts to boil.  Yeah, right at the end.  Like a potato being rolled over.  Where are we going to have our gas off?  I don't know.  We'd never forget about that.  I'd love to.  I would love to, too.  But you're Star Wars nerds. 
[03:27:00]  Man, I don't like the fact that they put in something that covered the squares.  Those were the original makings.  But, Frank, it looks better now digitally in hand.  I don't care.  I prefer the original version I saw when I was a boy.  Frank.  They thought I wasn't enjoying it, but I was.  Frank, you can see the strings back then.  I didn't notice the strings because of my frown.  My eyes were squinted and I was a boy filled with wonderment. 
[03:27:30]  What happened?  Nothing stupid.  I enjoyed the film greatly.  You just spit in my face.  I once asked my father to take me again and he slapped me in the face.  Colin, yes.  That's it.  I'm punching out.  I loved Lord Vader.  He was so mysterious.  Yeah.  Because behind that mask, he didn't know if he was frowning or smiling. 
[03:28:00]  That's true.  Do you know it takes...  It takes 42 muscles.  From what I understand, I've been told 42 muscles to frown and I don't know how many  to smile because it hurt too much to look at him.  And it never would matter to you anyway.  No.  Roland in studio.  Roland.  Roland, you know a little thing about the Star Wars?  Yeah, I've seen them all.  Oh.  Oh, so you're a big Star Wars geek?  No, my brother is.  I'm not that big. 
[03:28:30]  You don't know anything about the new old version coming out?  I heard about it, yeah.  Yeah, DVD.  What can you tell us about it?  You heard about it, so.  Uh, they're putting like extra six hours of bonus material on it.  Oh.  Of what?  Behind the scenes stuff on the DVD.  What kind of material?  Bonus material.  Bonus, but I mean, no, that...  Uh, there's like directors, he's gonna, George Lucas has some commentary on it.  The what?  Some commentary.  The who?  What stuff do they fix in the original?  Uh, that, I don't know I'm that big of a... 
[03:29:00]  Who's your favorite Star Wars character?  Do you want to read about it, though?  Chewbacca?  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  Wait.  Chewbacca.  What's his name?  Chewbacca?  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  There is something going on with that.  Chewbacca.  I'm a Mexican.  Han Solo.  Chewbacca, is he?  Chewbacca.  You know Chewbacca's my favorite guy.  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  Chewbacca.  So, Han Solo, then.  Yeah, Han Solo.  Yeah, Han Solo.  More than an outer space cowboy, kind of. 
[03:29:30]  What was your favorite Star Wars movie?  Uh, Empire Strikes Back.  Yeah, why?  There's more action in space.  Weren't they all in space, though?  More action in space.  It was a war in space.  Space, yeah.  And so, amongst the stars, a war.  Yeah, you find Vader's Luke's father, so.  Yeah.  Thanks for wrecking it.  He was?  I didn't see the, uh...  Yeah, he was.  Sorry, Jim.  I didn't see that one.  I like the Ewoks. 
[03:30:00]  When I was a little boy, I told my father I wanted to pet an Ewok, and he open-hand smacked  me in the mouth.  He told me, if I can smile, I can pet one.  Let's go to Kevin in Indiana.  Will you stop looking at your BlackBerry?  Yeah, what are you looking at your BlackBerry for?  Every time he gets nervous, he wants to make believe he's got to do something.  Scroll fast!  Scroll fast!  Scroll fast!  Let's go to Kevin.  Hey, um, nothing, as a Star Wars fan, nothing made me laugh more than hearing, uh, Jim make 
[03:30:30]  fun of the Cantina Band that one time.  I fucking hated that stupid...  I hated the creased fucking body of the fucking blue elephant.  Yeah, see?  Now that's something that they changed also.  The bar scene, uh, they covered up a lot of the bad puppet head things with some CGI  creatures in the bar.  Yeah, they should have covered that up with a fucking deletion.  Now, you're gonna get a DVD version.  A baby dick. 
[03:31:00]  Of horrible masks and stuff that, now you're gonna see with crystal clarity how awful these  masks are.  What was this fucking faggot elephant playing?  It's fucking horrendous.  It's playing right now, Jimmy.  I know, but what would the elephant play?  The piano?  Oh, yeah, I think it was playing the stupid piano thing.  George Lucas should be fucking shot.  That was...  Ah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  You don't have one figurine, Anthony.  Uh, let me think.  No, no Star Wars, um, figurines. 
[03:31:30]  I had all of them.  What figurines do you have?  Some type of death figurines?  No, I got a lot of stuff that Big Kev gave me from, uh, Spawn.  A lot of that stuff.  I got, like, life-size, um, uh...  What the hell is that one?  The Bruce Campbell character from, uh...  What the hell?  The Necronomicon.  Yeah.  What is it?  Pardon me.  Evil Dead.  Evil Dead.  The Evil Ash.  All that fun stuff.  Do you ever go over to somebody's house with all the little figurines, and they're around  35, you just want to just take your hand and smash them all off? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, but...  Huh?  Big Kev's got a huge showcase full of...  Does he have a showcase?  ...figurines, yeah.  That's fine.  I don't mind that.  That's a collectible one.  But they're really, like, really cool collectible ones.  Dane probably has 10 million.  If you go into...  See?  He has a huge office and just little figurines everywhere, and every time I go there, I just want to shake  the bookshelf.  Does he have Star Wars ones?  Huh?  Yeah.  Does he get upset if you put the Star Wars ones with other...  Like with the Simpsons?  Can't do that.  His agent, I actually... 
[03:32:30]  I got a big...  It's called the Thin.  The Thin and Nasty.  Oh my God, that's going to cost him.  All right.  Oh, now we need some license all over here.  The what?  Is it Obie's fart?  Yeah.  That's going to smell good.  It's blueberries and granola.  Oh, I had a lot of steak this weekend.  Yeah, it's rotting meat.  The what, Bobby?  Does he have the Star Wars figurines still in the fucking boxes?  He has some of them.  Most of them are out.  But he has a...  God, is that Fabrice?  Fabrice.  I need some, too.  Chris from Philly, real fast. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, that's refreshing.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Anthony, do you still have that amazing video of you with the lightsaber?  If I do, I'll look for it.  It might be on another computer, an older computer.  But I will...  I will.  If I find it, I will absolutely post it.  It's ridiculous.  It's me just swinging around a lightsaber.  Sorry, it's a broom.  No, but...  Don't be carried away.  Hey, it looks just like me swinging around a lightsaber.  And it makes a sound... 
[03:33:30]  Guys, we've got to change gears.  I look great.  I'm scared.  We've got a big star on the hotline.  I'm in an apartment in Brooklyn with a lightsaber at the time.  What a tool.  A broom.  It's a broom handle.  Who's our big star?  You watch Rockstar?  We have Ryan Starr.  Absolutely.  Were you here for the Ryan Starr interview?  Yeah, he was very cool.  Ryan Starr from Huntington, Long Island, our hometown.  He was on Rockstar.  We interviewed him about a week ago, and this is what I said to him.  Ryan, hear me now.  You're going to win the whole thing. 
[03:34:00]  I'll tell you why.  Why is it?  There's six finalists left.  Two of them are chicks, so goodbye to the chicks.  Tommy Lee is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Yeah.  Jason Newstead is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Gilby, maybe.  Maybe.  So then you're down to the four finalists.  Sure.  So I basically told him he was going to win the whole thing.  Kreskin.  You're like Kreskin.  Oh, what?  You never make predictions.  Without the predictability. 
[03:34:30]  Because he was voted off that night.  The worst.  Ryan.  And it wasn't even head-to-head.  It was still six people.  I know.  It was just...  Sorry about that, Ryan.  I have to say, I was on the line a little bit ago.  The scheduling got messed up, but I didn't think I could feel dirtier than last week  when you were talking about your brother's, like, you know, masturbation story, than when  you were talking about the apple pies and the patients.  Oh, it was horrible.  I was like, I've got to hang up.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, see?  Good move. 
[03:35:00]  Good move.  You're trying to make sure you have a career.  First thing I'm waking up to.  Jesus.  So, you fell victim to what we call the Opie curse, by the way.  Yeah, thanks, man.  That's great.  Whenever Opie picks a sporting team or anything else to win, it is surely going to go down  in defeat.  I love it.  I want to take you to Vegas and just vote against you.  Well, look.  Here's the deal, though.  Everyone in the audience started booing.  They did not like the decision that they made.  It was a controversial exit they've had.  Right.  Our buddy Roland here is a big fan, Ryan. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, obviously, we were disappointed.  Roland, go ahead.  You can ask me whatever you want.  Yeah.  Are you there?  Yeah, yeah.  He gets a little shook up with so many people listening.  And a celebrity.  He's nervous in front of a mic.  They get slow.  They get slow.  He's a celebrity.  Someone on TV.  He gets a little nervous.  Go ahead, Roland.  Go.  Are you planning any New York concert dates?  I certainly am.  Right now, I'm here in Hollywood still, and I'm just taking care of business right now, 
[03:36:00]  hitting the ground running with this whole opportunity, and probably be in New York around  October.  I mean, check it out.  My website's ryanstar.tv, and I think that'll have all the dates up as soon as I know what  they are.  Ryan, Ryan, I heard you were actually trying to get your album on as quick as possible  so you could...  Capitalize.  He's still on you.  He's smart.  Are you doing it now?  He's smart.  I had a record out before I came here, which was just a bunch of sketches of me playing  at my house, raw stuff. 
[03:36:30]  The new thing I'm going to do is hopefully get out right away like a live album, and I'm  talking about recording it as soon as possible.  I even talked to Dave Navarro the other day, and he mentioned he would totally be into playing  a few songs with me on the live taping.  So that's exciting.  Nice.  What are the odds of Roland getting Navarro or something on the show?  Can we get one of those guys too?  Yeah.  We can get him to call in.  Okay, yeah.  That was great.  Hey, Ryan.  I got to say, he's the reason I went on the show, and he's the reason I think I stayed  on the show, because he's truly credible for all the things he's done, and he made me 
[03:37:00]  feel...  If he can do it, I felt I can do it.  And that was definitely a cool thing.  And I'm hoping to get back on.  They're having this thing with Verizon.  If you text, the word...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ryan, let me set it up by saying this.  You said that you were a big fan of the O.P. and Anthony show, right?  Certainly, yeah.  Okay.  We're going to show you the power of the show.  You will be going back on that show.  Wow.  Verizon's doing this thing, and now you can explain it.  But we're going to show you the power of this show.  Here it goes.  Actually, when Big Brother was on the air, we decided to go with Eddie, one-legged Eddie, 
[03:37:30]  who's now a really good friend of mine.  Okay.  We got everyone behind Eddie for Big Brother.  He won the whole thing, and he was nowhere near the favorite.  Wow.  Nowhere near the favorite.  So watch the power of this show.  Now, ask very nicely, because the O.N.A. Pests are listening right now, what they need to do.  Well, very nicely, I will ask.  And you should beg and plead a little bit.  I beg.  All right.  This is my mission right now.  If you want to get me back on the show for the finale, basically, on a Verizon phone, 
[03:38:00]  you simply text the word CRAVE to the number 8197, and then they're going to text you back  and just say, who do you want to get back on the show?  And you write Ryan, and then I'll be there next week.  I mean, I'll only have missed one week of Supernova, and I could just officially start  my solo career and launch it on international television, which would be just incredible.  Ryan, can I tell you something, too?  Yeah.  That band is, you know, they're going to do all right for about a year. 
[03:38:30]  You're better off not winning the thing.  You heard my closing statements to them.  I thought I just was very genuine in my beliefs.  Those guys are all great musicians.  I would never take that away from them, but I'm telling you, you're better off on your  own.  Well, I hope that's the case, and I hope when I get back to New York, I can come and play  some songs for you guys.  No!  Yeah.  That's what he says.  I want that.  I'll talk about masturbation enough so we can... 
[03:39:00]  No, we would love to have you.  So why don't you do that plug again?  I'm serious.  I want the pests that have Verizon to help out Ryan Starr, one of our own from Long Island,  who is a big fan of the show here.  Thanks, guys.  It means the world to...  We used to drive to the studio every day listening to you guys, so musically, you probably had  some sort of influence in our songs.  All right.  But on a Verizon phone, you text the word CRAVE to 8197, and simply they're going to write  back, who do you want?  And you write Ryan, and hopefully I'm in a week playing an encore performance on the 
[03:39:30]  last show.  And we'll throw that up on our website for you.  Thank you so much, man.  I never know how to do that.  Like, you type in 8197 first?  Yeah, well, it's the number.  Instead of, like, a 10-digit number, it's a four-digit number.  That's the number you're texting.  You have to go to the text message part of your phone.  You can't just dial it.  Wait, who has a Verizon phone?  Let's try it.  I do right now.  I do.  Messages.  All right, so I'll open this up.  Wait, messages. 
[03:40:00]  This is great.  I'm getting one phone right now.  You type in new.  Type in new.  Don't yell at me.  I'm looking.  I'm on my black way.  Wait, I'll do two.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got Verizon?  Oh, shit.  If everyone did it right now that's listening, I'll definitely win.  I mean, there's no doubt about it.  It's got to be Verizon?  Verizon.  I got singular.  I got sprints.  Wait a minute.  I don't know how to do this.  I'm dumb.  What if I do it anyway?  It's a Verizon promotion.  But what if I do it anyway? 
[03:40:30]  I don't think anything happens.  I think they take away votes.  New address.  No.  I'm going to do it, stupid.  Just tell me.  Why do we have to do new address?  Go to a great news.  Look at me.  Because don't you have to text it to somebody?  I'm going to show you.  No, you tell me because people are listening to us.  So I'm walking them through it, too.  But I can't see it.  Go to your text message.  Okay.  That would be right messages.  Okay.  Now go to new.  Click it again.  Go to new.  New address or new group?  New address.  Okay.  Okay.  What do you type in as the new address? 
[03:41:00]  Type in the number.  Type in the number.  We're under first.  What's the number?  8197.  Oh, 8197.  That's the name of the person you're texting to it.  That's the number.  That's the number, basically.  Even though it's a number.  Yes, I know.  Wait a minute.  This is not.  Man, I hope everyone out there is voting right now.  That would be awesome.  Dude, I don't know how to do this.  Can I see your phone?  I'll show you.  No.  Stand over my shoulder and I'll show you.  No, just tell me.  When you text someone, Jimmy, you have to find a name to text them.  Right.  Instead, you're going to write 8197 as the name, even though it's a number.  Get it? 
[03:41:30]  Right.  And then the message, when you go to text them.  No way.  Okay.  And then you.  I want to do this right, actually.  But the.  Yeah, help me try out.  I know.  8197 and then you write the word crave.  How do you spell that?  That's when you're texting.  That's the message you're texting.  Yes.  You would spell that because that's a weird word.  K.  See?  I went with it.  8197, right?  And then spell that.  So you got C-R-A-V-E.  You guys doing all right?  Crave. 
[03:42:00]  Like you crave something.  There you go.  8197.  No, I'm not doing this right.  I hope you don't.  Jimmy.  Because he won't let.  He's such a control freak.  Let Robert Kelly help you.  Let me help you.  Look at it.  I'm not going to look at it because I can't come over there.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Let me.  Don't.  Don't.  Look out.  Don't.  Somebody.  No, dude.  Go to.  No, stupid.  I'm going back to the beginning.  Go to new.  All right.  He's panicking, Ryan.  Hold on a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Stop.  Stop.  That's male.  Right.  No, no.  You want to text. 
[03:42:30]  Go back.  Go back.  Hit it again.  Hit it again.  Text the word.  Now go to compose SMS.  I.  Go to that.  Compose SMS.  You're like a little retarded boy.  What the?  SMS on him.  Somebody give him an apple pie.  Now go to.  Yeah.  Now what?  I want to.  I have to touch it.  Let me touch it.  Just tell him.  No, when I do anything.  Electronic computers or anything.  I can't say it.  I need to touch it.  Let me touch it.  Did you just fucking fart?  Oh, God. 
[03:43:00]  You farted right over your shoulder.  We're trying to help you out, but no one can figure it out here.  Oh, my God.  Well, maybe you could put remedial directions on the website.  Oh, wait.  I got it.  There you go.  Shut up, stupid.  I know what I'm doing.  Don't call me stupid.  Why am I so stupid?  Because your little fingers can't work.  Eight, one, nine, seven is the name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, no name.  Hit that.  Now.  Yeah, really?  Wrong.  Stupid.  Wrong shit, dick.  You fucking cunt.  Roland, can you ask him a show-related question while I'm doing this?  If you give other back, what song would you perform? 
[03:43:30]  Hopefully, my original Back of Your Car did let me play again.  And if not that, I'd say Losing My Religion.  I had a fun time with that.  Yeah, right on.  Hold on.  We got Roland here.  Excellent.  What's the thing again?  Eight, one, nine, seven.  Roland.  Roland, come on.  Go.  Just read it.  Just ask me.  Just talk to him. 
[03:44:00]  You guys would be proud to know that, speaking of a solo career, the top downloaded song on  MSN right now is my original track.  Oh, nice.  So, so far, it's already set me up for something, and I'm hoping to just run with it.  Watch how cool this is.  Rob?  What's up, Rob?  Hey, I just want to let you guys know I've already texted out about 17 times while Jimmy  was trying to do a one.  I love you, man.  Hey, Ryan, you kick ass, buddy.  Good luck.  Thanks for bringing me back.  Thanks.  Hey, you guys, a lot of talent, a lot of promise, buddy. 
[03:44:30]  Good luck.  Appreciate that, dude.  And Brooke is just looking hot on that stage, though.  I just sent, even though I don't have Verizon.  Did you see the episode where I just hugged her for like 10 minutes?  I just sent.  I don't know what it'll do.  And sent it, even though he doesn't have Verizon phone.  I don't know what it'll do.  No, they're going to send it back to you now.  You'll see.  And what'll it say?  Go F yourself, get Verizon.  And I love the word rocker.  Rocker.  Jimmy just voted for you now.  Did it work?  Yeah, it worked.  All right.  So what do you do, Bob?  Well, on Jimmy's phone, what you got to do is hit...  On the BlackBerry.  BlackBerry.  You have to hit, on the BlackBerry, you have to hit compose SMS mail. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, my goodness.  You put it in a name.  It doesn't matter.  Where do you put the name in?  Huh?  Up here?  Yeah, well, you don't have to put a name.  Don't yell at me.  I'm asking for it.  Then you do the number, and then you type in the text part of it.  The part where you usually...  You're being very helpful.  Thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate that.  Yes.  One nerd to the other.  All right.  I don't care.  Ryan, the big plug again.  Yeah, you guys rock, because I think in this time, I think everyone voted like 50 times.  So we did the job.  Just keep it going.  But thanks, man. 
[03:45:30]  You know, the Rockstar Supernova thing, they're going to bring us back if you text 8197,  and you write the word crave, and then everything else.  It should be self-explanatory.  All right.  But thanks for the support, and seriously, man, it means the world to me.  So thank you.  All right.  We'll see you when you're in New York, all right?  Definitely.  Definitely.  All right.  Ryan Starr, everyone.  Thanks, Ryan.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I don't know.  We're going to take a break.  We'll finish the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  What time is it?  Well, we'll go a little late.  I didn't realize it was that late.  A little late today.  No, no.  We finished 11-01.  We got to do a little make-up.  We looked at 10 the other day, didn't we? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, production, though?  I don't know.  Roland, Star Wars, so that would be good.  That's good.  Absolutely.  What do you think of the...  Well, all right.  You think it's...  Jesus.  Who the fuck was Billy Dee Williams?  Lando Calrissian.  Oh, you know that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a Star Wars fan.  No, he knows his stuff.  He's like a fanatic.  Do you own the DVDs?  Uh, I do own the re-release.  I tweaked it up.  Do you actually own... 
[03:46:30]  Because some people own the VCR version, the VHS tape version of Star Wars.  No.  Did you know that James Earl Jones...  The voice.  The voice of Darth Vader was not credited in the original Star Wars.  You will see that.  Well, he wasn't SAG.  I hear it.  Why did I say it?  I don't know, and I'll hear it in the replay, too.  No, he was a...  Yeah.  Well, he was SAG.  Well, they didn't...  He was a screen acting group.  I don't think they wanted to, like, give away the whole... 
[03:47:00]  How do you own the re-release?  The speak of the whole thing.  What?  How do you fucking retarded?  What?  They changed the scroll, the format of the scroll that goes up at the beginning.  It doesn't say episode four, A New Hope.  Just starts off with the whole story.  Wait.  There was no chapters.  The original or the new one?  The original, original one you saw in the movie theater, which is also the newest one  that's coming out.  A lot of little things. 
[03:47:30]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,  Oh, look, it's Darth Earl.  He just walked into, uh...  Oh, my God.  Darth Earl just walked into the production.  It's Darth Vader.  Darth Vader.  He dresses him black every day.  Did you...  Speaking of Black Girl and the Black Girl song that Brother Joe did...  Yes.  Have you seen the video yet on YouTube?  No.  That's what I'm telling you.  YouTube is...  I'm obsessed with this damn thing. 
[03:48:00]  It's great.  They made a video.  A video.  To the Brother Joe...  Fantastic.  Black Girl song.  It's up on YouTube.  The Brother Joe Earl song.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search or Black Girl.  Actually...  Oh, he actually...  Is Earl here because Ron and Fez are deciding to work today?  Yeah.  Is that what we're getting?  Yeah, their suspension's over.  I thought Ron and Fez Stern were taking more vacation time or something.  Here, click on the Black Girl by Brother Joe right there.  Yeah.  Just show Anthony this.  Big thing.  Don't even get into it. 
[03:48:30]  And look at this.  Turn this around for Ant.  You know, you don't have the song playing.  That's right.  I can picture it in my head.  You'll get the idea.  I'll use my imagination.  Ah, way up...  Yeah, there it is.  It's so worth checking out.  Black Girl.  There's Black Girl.  It's very funny.  How can I play it over here?  Like this?  Play.  Save over $500.  That ain't it.  That's the TV.  That's the TV.  Whatever.  You can check it out for yourself on YouTube.  I get it.  Oh, my God.  He's sleeping.  They got him sleeping on a couch. 
[03:49:00]  He's drinking a beer.  Sitting on...  It looks very old-timey.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, because he sings it with that voice.  Right.  That voice.  Black Girl.  Wow.  That's very good.  It's really good, man.  There's probably, I don't know, a couple hundred stills.  Who did this?  It's great.  It really is great.  Is there a name?  In by Facto, 714.  Is that you, bro?  Wow.  Good job.  But it's unbelievable.  Check it out for yourself.  It's up on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony or Black Earl in the search engine. 
[03:49:30]  Who's Earl?  All right.  We got to take a break.  We'll finish the show next.  Oxygen?  Lethal?  Find out how.  Coming up on the Opie and Anthony show.  That piece of crap show.  It amazes me every day we pull this off.  It's a madhouse.  Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man, you're on it and by you and we generate 
[03:50:00]  Nice job.  Trying to educate young Derrick.  Derrick, man, Derrick, look it up.  Trust me.  What have you done?  Changes.  Huh?  Changes? 
[03:50:30]  For Star Wars?  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, it is ridiculous.  Pages of it.  Pages and pages.  I heard they see the eye  and a fucking chin  for George Lucas.  Fucking dumb characters.  Little fuzzy things.  And it's made him rich.  Yeah, I know.  I'm pleased.  You know what?  Bob Leskibar fucking sold  heroin and cocaine.  Cocaine only.  Why did I say heroin?  I don't know.  How do you know about the heroin?  Thanks.  All right, let's get into  one more thing.  We'll get out of here.  One more thing.  Yeah, hey.  The Taco Bill 911 call? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  Something new?  Yeah.  Well, we've had it in front of us  for weeks, but...  I heard about the other...  We're busy.  Fast Food 911 call.  What am I rolling now?  Do you want to shove  a mic in front of me?  This is just one of those  bad 911 calls,  somebody wasting  the law enforcement's time.  Yeah.  They use some racist language  at the...  Oh.  Oh.  Well, that's some of my  favorite language. 
[03:51:30]  You should...  911, what's your murder?  I need assistance  of Jim's,  of Lincoln,  and Woodbury.  I know.  What's the problem?  They stole my damn dollar.  He won't fix my tackle.  I'm half over my kidney.  He's holding my dollar  and 10 cents.  Hold on, hold on, slow down.  What's going on?  Hello?  What did I say?  I can't tell.  You're yelling at me.  I need assistance.  I want my dollar  or my taco.  You're having a problem  with the taco?  The owner,  the proprietor here.  You're having a problem  with the taco?  I am.  The owner, bitch.  Pardon me.  Excuse me?  I am upset.  I know. 
[03:52:00]  You have to calm down  and kind of tell me  what's going on here now.  I'm going to listen  to any goddamn thing  I'm saying.  Are you drunk?  No, I am not a drunk.  Okay, then why don't you  just start talking a little bit.  You get your motherfucking ass  over here.  Slow down.  I need some information  from you, so slow down.  You bring your ass  and get my motherfucking taco  out of here.  My ass is staying  in the office here,  so you need to  you need to calm down  and tell me something here.  Okay?  All right, bitch.  What was wrong  with the taco?  The motherfucking  refused to sell it to me. 
[03:52:30]  He refused to sell you a taco?  He won't get any of my money back.  He took your money,  but he won't give you a taco.  The goddamn house  is locked up,  you motherfucking youth.  I got $1.75.  Me?  Why are you calling me names?  Look, are you coming in  and out?  As far as I'm concerned,  you can have that taco.  I want my goddamn dollar.  What?  I said, as far as I'm concerned,  you can have the taco.  Tell that bitch over here.  How am I going to get  to this before  and get my money?  Okay.  What's your name?  Antoinette.  Antoinette.  Yeah.  I want my dollar  and my taco.  And he took your money, 
[03:53:00]  but he wouldn't give you  your food.  That's correct.  That's not right.  What's your name for it?  I don't have to give you  all that to come get my dollar.  I'm upset.  You don't have to do anything  if you don't want.  Well, then goddamn  it'll fix me.  Calm down.  I'm trying to get  the info from you.  You eat an arson.  I have an aggro life statement.  This motherfucker's  been selling to me  and you are too.  Antoinette.  Yes.  Are you going to give me  the information  or you just want to  yell at me?  You got to come here  and get my dollar  out this next thing.  Or else what?  Look,  you refuse to help me?  No, I'm trying 
[03:53:30]  to get some information.  What the fuck do you want?  Where are you at right now?  What did I say?  Where did I say I was?  I know, but where are you?  Are you going to stay there  or are you going to go to your house?  Yeah, I'll be here.  Don't come here with no nigger.  What?  Don't bring no nigger here.  Who's a nigger?  Look,  are you coming?  Are you calling me in?  No, I said  don't bring no nigger here.  What does that have to do  with this?  You come here.  Do you want,  are you saying  you want a white deputy  or what?  How long?  Are you saying  you want a white deputy?  Exactly.  You don't want an evil  African-American deputy?  No, I don't.  Why's that?  Yes. 
[03:54:00]  Jesus.  They should have sent a cop  and then just shot her.  What does she have  for the rest of us?  She was white?  No, she might have been black.  No.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  And she didn't want  a black cop?  Yeah.  Because they would have  been on to her.  Maybe.  Maybe she knows  that the white cop  would have had the white guilt  and said,  ah, just give her the taco  and the black cop  would have went,  look, I know, bitch,  you didn't give her any money.  You called us up  and said  you gave her money  and she didn't give you 
[03:54:30]  the taco.  Patrice said a joke  about that once.  Exactly.  He said that he  if he ever gets  anything in a restaurant  or in a store,  he prays that  it's a white manager.  Yeah.  Because a white manager  will actually take care.  If it's a black manager,  he'll be like,  what?  What do you want?  He actually said that.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you trying to pull?  What are you trying to get?  I know what you're doing.  We interrupt this program  to bring the ozone midget sighting  of the day. 
[03:55:00]  Who saw that coming?  Ah, Raj, what's up?  Sorry.  Yeah, man, I saw me a midget  over the weekend.  Yeah, get off the speakerphone  and tell us about it.  Yeah, I was over there  in the raging water  there.  Stand in as high!  Anyway,  this little midget  goes up to the little  36-inch thing  as he wants to go on the ride.  He's not tall enough.  He's jumping up and down  and his mom goes,  I don't know why  that's that size  is 36 inches.  The poor kid  was all upset. 
[03:55:30]  It's all wallowing away.  Yeah, that's that serious.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  God, we all just hated him.  Collectively.  We didn't want to...  Bobby, you didn't finish, man.  No one wanted to deal with that.  No.  Yeah.  No, but that...  What's up with you?  I don't know. 
[03:56:00]  I just had a mood swing.  Why?  I don't know.  Something happened.  Menopause?  What have you got?  Hot flashes?  You're from feeling chubby  to feeling fat.  You know, I'm sick  that you lost a few pounds  and all of a sudden  you're fucking Jack LaLanne.  Jack LaLanne, nice.  Modern day reference.  My Vic Tanny?  Well, it's not like  he's in shape.  He's A-shape.  Little Norton.  You were losing weight  for a while.  I was, and then  I snapped my knee again.  Really?  I hurt my knee.  What, did you trip  and fall into a cake? 
[03:56:30]  Well, I really don't like  the fact that you...  I'm not perfect,  but I mean...  Really?  You're not perfect?  I think I got some gut, man.  It's slow.  Slow going.  I had a bad couple of weeks  and I was lazy.  But it ain't going...  Just playing lazy?  Well, you know...  Everybody's a little fucking,  a little out of shape here.  Well, I'm talking...  Yeah, but...  Nobody's really...  Who's in shape in this room?  Anthony's got a great physique.  Hope's in good shape.  Let me see your abs. 
[03:57:00]  I'm skinny.  No.  Let me see your abs.  Show him the V.  Let me see the abs.  Believe me, if he doesn't  get fucking clear stuff,  I'll get my dollar.  When you were naked  in your underwear?  Ooh.  When you were in that  little video you did?  Yeah, but I saw...  I saw a couple rolls.  I was leaning forward.  Get a roll in your chest.  I've never seen somebody  with three rolls  all up the front of their body.  You should hear the line  I fucking got out.  You guys got more rolls  in a bakery.  Where is that guy? 
[03:57:30]  More shins  in a Chinese phone book.  What was that?  That was hurtful.  Oh, what?  Bob?  I thought I was in good shape.  That's why I decided  to disrobe finally.  I was working on that moment  for many years.  Now he's never going to  do another rape video.  Thanks.  Damn it.  Thanks for nothing.  No.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Stop my friend's body.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:58:00]  You're fucking...  Jimmy, like a skunk.  I got defensive  when someone was...  My friend was in soft.  I got defensive.  I can't throw that.  He's throwing the friend.  Jimmy fucking...  Pulled his pants.  Jimmy pulled his pants down.  Opened up his butt cheeks.  Pointed him at Bob.  And fought it like a juicy...  That would have looked  like a fire-breathing dragon  if we could have liked that thing.  What did you see? 
[03:58:30]  Oh, it was...  You need a cop...  A cop here.  I want to describe it to him.  Did it open up?  I want him to go catch it.  I have a small one.  I have a small one coming.  I'm going to be like,  shut up.  Dude, don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Wait, can we light one of those?  You know what it looks like?  No.  I swear to God,  it looks like a Dominican's cunt.  It's like...  It's like grayish...  It's a gray-colored asshole  with just a little hair. 
[03:59:00]  Nice, right?  Like a little  eight-year-old Dominican girl.  I'd have it rubbed  during a massage.  How bad would he get  raped in prison?  Oh, that little fine little...  Not a hair on it.  Not a hair on it.  Hey, the View Store  with Rosie O'Donnell.  Let's try it on.  Oh, whoo.  Oh, look at the size of her.  Got a hair on it.  Hey, the View Store  with Rosie O'Donnell.  All right, we just heard us say that.  Oh, whoo.  We said that right.  Where's Rosie?  Hi, we'll be boys.  It's debut of Rosie O'Donnell.  With her new non-dike hairdo. 
[03:59:30]  Yes.  Not only did we choose the color,  we said we don't want it  to look like someone's  grandmother's living room anymore.  By the way.  Do you remember  the old set was kind of beige  and kind of...  I didn't enjoy it.  It was.  It was very nice.  Do you think there's anyone  who does not know  that maybe we should introduce you  or is that our message?  Oh, they know.  Okay, my name is Meredith Fiera  and welcome...  Oh, I look like Meredith  eight stars.  No, it's my first day  on the View.  I'm in the Meredith chair  and it's exciting.  You put on my hair. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, great.  Did you just give her a fat joke?  I'm wearing my heels today  because...  Yes, I saw that.  Well, because you girls  are...  Your heel wearers on this show.  And we also have hair,  which I noticed  that you've grown yours.  Well, I had that crazy,  crazy haircut  that scared America to death.  So, you know,  it's going to be long  from now on  and I'm taking my medicine  so everything's fine.  Wait a second.  You're very glam.  Day one.  Day one.  You're taking your medicine.  Have you told your friend  Tom Pursa?  You're going to go at it. 
[04:00:30]  What is going on?  Yeah, there's a little...  Well, I don't want to say  who sent me  these beautiful flowers  sitting in front of me,  but it could be  someone named Tom Cruise.  Yes.  Well, did he?  How does he feel  about you taking  your medication?  He's a very nice...  Are you being glib?  And his sandwich,  Spanso.  Tom Cruise,  but maybe we'll...  We have so much  to talk about today,  so we should put  time for tomorrow?  Well, whatever you like.  What did you do this summer?  What was your summer about?  Whatever you like.  You're the boss.  The viewmaster.  Let us just enjoy it.  I like the beard.  I like the beard.  I like the beard. 
[04:01:00]  I like the beard.  I like the beard.  This is how long  we've been awake.  Yeah, right.  You know who you look like?  Mel Gibson's therapist.  I know Bill is actually  growing the extensions  that I'm going to need  because I impulsively  cut my hair in August.  I love it.  It looks beautiful.  Oh, my God.  There's applause breaks  for everything on this show.  I hate her.  I take some dead weight off.  I had a bad day  and chopped it.  Same thing.  Did you regret it?  Did you have hair remorse? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  I did.  Lost a little weight, too.  I know.  You look adorable, I think.  Well, thanks, ladies.  I am growing it  in the process of it.  I do.  Her face is what  they call fuckable.  She's peeing on the floor now.  That's how you're saying.  I said that about Jim.  How old?  She is 17 months.  She's going to be on the floor.  Parker did that  until he was four.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  You know, we had,  I don't know, boys,  we had a Fisher-Price  Playtex, like,  plastic kitchen thing.  Playtex was wrong.  Yeah, they make tampons  and baby products.  They do, actually.  Barbara hates her. 
[04:02:00]  Hates her.  She won't look at her.  She won't look at her.  No.  And I remember  we were sitting watching TV  once and Kelly and I were like,  what's that smell?  And when he was like three years old,  he used to go tinkle  into the sink  on the Fisher-Price.  I'm sure he's going to love me  telling this now  that he's 11.  But kids,  kids in some of the,  you know,  they learn.  When you're 19 years old,  that's a good time.  Yeah.  How are you doing  on the toilet training?  Are you starting?  Well, that was the toilet training.  Barbara can't hang with her.  She just pointed at it.  I did put her on the toilet  for a second  and she'll make the sound  of her mouth  and then she proceeds  to get off  and then pee on the rug.  Or in the bath. 
[04:02:30]  I got in the bath.  I put her in a cold dating suit.  I'm going to take a bath  and she sent him  to a tinkle  and she peed right in the tub.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like  an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put.  You put her in a dating suit  to take a bath  with a one-year-old?  Well, because, yeah,  I wanted to, like,  make it fun  and we were having  a pool party.  It was themed out, Rosie.  Really?  Yeah.  Because she didn't  want her to see you nudie?  Oh, no, she's seeing me nude.  She's a boobies, boobies.  Yeah.  You know, I just thought  we had a beach party  because she was going  through this fever.  She didn't want  to get her hair wet.  Yeah, yeah.  I tried everything.  I take a bath with Vivi, too.  In our family, the rule is, 
[04:03:00]  because I know  you used to take bath  with Jackie, right?  I took bath.  There was a very good time  for us to be together  and I've talked about this before.  Back on the prairie.  I'm sure again,  but it was the time  when I was able to explain it.  It should be role-reversed on.  Barbara's going to have  to take a bath.  We're going to explain  a lot there in the tub.  Yeah.  Because Vivi always looks at me  and says,  when am I getting my fur?  You just know  it's a big fucking  matched mess, Shay.  Now, Joy,  what did you do this summer?  Oh, all I did was stay home. 
[04:03:30]  I was supposed to go  to England and Edinburgh  and then when you realize  that the woman next to you  who has a baby  could have a bomb  in the baby's bottle,  you stay home.  I said, no, I'm not going.  What does that mean?  You're not a good traveler, right?  I am a travel-phobic.  Okay, I admit it.  Me, too.  Me, too.  I don't really like to travel.  I don't either.  The packing,  it's too scary  to get on the plane  and then you're over  the Atlantic Ocean  and it could blow up  and then I can't make it.  Then when the weather  was hot, you said,  it's too hot to travel.  Then when it got cold,  you said,  it's too cold and stuff. 
[04:04:00]  But you have...  Oh, shut up, you cadaver.  You need you into it.  However, you have big news.  Oh, my big news  is that my daughter, Eve,  has gotten engaged.  Oh.  I thought she was going to say  she has MJ.  That's fantastic.  She's adorable.  I think this is a wonderful boy.  Perfect for her.  Oh, good.  And matched.  He's a physician's assistant.  Of course he is.  He fixes people's sutures  and there's vomit and blood.  Yeah.  Oh, that's perfect for you. 
[04:04:30]  It's perfect  to have somebody  in the house like that.  I like him very much.  How long did he have a date?  About a year and a half.  He came to me at the beach  and he asked me  if he could have  my daughter's hand.  I know he's gunning  for more than that,  but still.  I said to him,  I asked him  a whole bunch of questions.  I told him.  Well, I said,  you know,  geographically,  are you going to,  do I have to take a plane  to get to visit you?  And he said no.  Because now Joy's daughter  lives right above her,  not that she has,  you know,  separation issues.  But they live  in the same building. 
[04:05:00]  Rosie, I grew up  in a tenement in Brooklyn  and my whole family  was in that building.  So this is the same concept  except with a doormat.  It's comforting.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, will they stay  in your apartment  or is he going to take her  to another state?  In her apartment.  She lives there.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  She, no,  what do you mean  take her to another state?  See, that's unacceptable.  Well, that's what,  that's what you asked him.  You said geographically.  You know how great it is  to see the two fucking comedians  taking charge  of another fucking,  that's where they're going to stay.  That's where they're going to stay.  That's where they're going to stay.  That's a blonde,  mouthfuckable one.  You sit there like dummies.  You know what I like though? 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  It's the fact that the show  is free.  What?  It's the fact that the show  is now free.  There isn't one  on the show.  After 25 years,  we're doing it too.  Any chance?  Barbara hates her dress  for the title.  Barbara knows  it's over for her.  I think you should.  I think you should.  What?  I think it's interesting.  Barbara,  no one gives you  a fucking bottle of water.  Who replaces Barbara?  Why would I get married  now at this point?  Barbara, come on.  Help me out. 
[04:06:00]  Why would she get married?  They said 25 happy years  of without marriage.  Why would she get married?  Why not?  I'm a single of covenants.  To me,  you do it once.  You get married once  like you did, right?  How many times  you did it once?  I'm only doing it once.  You didn't get married.  You didn't get married.  Shut up.  Get legal.  Barbara cannot control  Rosie O'Donnell.  You know,  we'll get to that now.  She is.  She really hates  her after the show today.  Rosie will tell her  to fuck herself.  No.  Oh.  Get married again  in Massachusetts. 
[04:06:30]  Well,  we don't want to get,  they have kids said to us,  get married in Massachusetts  because it's legal.  So I'm like,  what are we going to do  in state by state  have 50 weddings?  You know,  I get to wait.  We can do that.  We can cover it 50 times.  Did you hear what  I just asked her?  Yes.  About your blog?  Are we going to read  all about this?  I read all about  how upset you are.  I don't even know.  I have never read a blog.  Yes.  I don't know how to find a blog.  Well, here's what I said.  You look on the word perfect  and it says blog?  No, I don't think so.  That's when I read it.  I just started laughing  because it's like  Barbara Welch is experienced  after reading Rosie's blog. 
[04:07:00]  I'm like,  she doesn't know  how to get on Internet Explorer.  What are they talking about?  No one can print it out  and send it to us.  She can't read.  She read it.  Yeah.  I'll get your email.  Well, if I write anything  about The View,  I will send it to you.  But it was really  just about my feelings.  I was saying  that I felt powerless  and that I was a little  scared to come on The View  and it's a new chapter  of my life.  I was just being  dramatic and emotional.  Okay, just a second.  Yeah.  How long have we been  on the air?  Four minutes?  Yes.  How do you feel?  Really excited to be here  and kind of excited.  What the hell? 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  Is that us?  I'm just happy  that we're all here together.  I want to know  what brought you back later.  Tell us what brought you back.  All right, but first  we have to take a commercial.  Okay.  Then we're going to come back  with more Hot Topics  right after this  on The View.  Oh, oh.  Look at Barbara.  It was like,  I'm supposed to do that.  Barbara just looks like  a fucking dead body  with a bad wig.  Yeah.  She called Lucky Louie racist.  I want to drill my foot  into her twat.  Oh, she's heading  towards some problems 
[04:08:00]  with Rosie.  Oh, I hope her fucking  heart just stops  and she falls face first  into her big mug of coffee.  Probably fucking mucinex.  What'd she say  about Lucky Louie?  That it was racist.  What'd she say?  I called it racist.  Why was it racist?  I don't know,  because there was a black  in person and a white person  and the white people  didn't just laugh  at everything the black guy said.  I don't know.  And even Star Jones  climbed down  off the Empire State Building  and came to the rescue  and said,  no, it wasn't racist.  It was juvenile.  Who'd she have in her hand? 
[04:08:30]  She put down Naomi Watts.  Kishindra and Naomi Watts  danced for her.  And then they were  going to travel,  but Barbara was afraid  that Star would jump  bumping down on her luggage  in the airport.  These idiots  on instant feedback.  First of all,  we were supposed  to be off at 11.  We decided...  Oh, no, they're not.  Yeah.  No, they're...  This is actually a big...  Stop fucking listening.  This is a big pop culture story  Rosie O'Donnell  started on the news,  so we took a peek.  Yeah.  Sorry, one guy.  Be more funny. 
[04:09:00]  We were funny today  for five fucking hours.  You motherfucking  faceless internet cocksucker.  Don't fucking listen, then.  Don't listen.  Man, just turn...  I cannot stand these people.  It's just ridiculous, though.  Or come down here  and wait for us  at the front of the studio.  And you wait for...  There you go.  For Kenny to come out  and beat the shit out of you.  And Kenny and Poe  will beat the fuck out of you.  Not...  And me and Opie  will get down in your face  and laugh at you  as you lay there.  After you're hurt enough  that you can't fight back.  Right.  You know what?  So I wasn't sure  he was totally tied up.  Immobilized? 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  I took a little chance.  These fucking bastard assholes.  Shove it up your ass.  Don't listen.  I beg you to go away.  I beg you to go away  from this show.  You can't do it.  You can't do it.  Do you think the Rosie-Barber thing  is staged  because they know  it will get people  completely interested?  I don't think Barbara's  that smart.  No, I don't think  they can do that  when it comes to that shit.  I think it's really ego.  It's not like they know each other.  They're going on the show.  Rosie was the king of her show.  Rosie is the alpha male.  She's definitely the alpha male.  Dude! 
[04:10:00]  She's definitely in charge.  Barbara is the...  Dude!  She's the pack lady.  Dude, listen to him.  Dude, she's the pack lady.  I asked a simple question.  He's got a 40-minute dissertation.  Tied up into a bow.  Why don't you fucking  swallow poison?  If you watch  The Dog Whisperer,  you'd know something  about women.  Oh.  All right?  Sit down.  The Dog Whisperer.  What's The Dog Whisperer?  Cesar Millan.  Huh?  You know what I say to dogs?  Here, there's some peanut butter.  No, you don't.  You pick your nose  and you feed it to my dog,  you freaking creep.  So what?  You dumb dogs eat it.  I'll feed them boogers every time. 
[04:10:30]  I feed them a juicy hanger,  a lunger.  That is really rank.  And then do you let the dogs  kiss your face?  Of course he does.  They kiss his fat lips.  Bob has juicy kissable lips  and the dogs know it.  I like to call them  pillow lips, Jimmy.  They are pillow lips.  Let's get the hell out of here.  I say so.  Where are we going to go?  All right.  We're going to go watch the news.  I didn't like what we're doing,  so we'll get off the air  and listen to some fucking bit.  We've already played 20 fucking times.  Why don't we go find him  and all four of us  beat the shit out of him.  And fuck him in the ass.  And then we'll fuck him in the ass  and suck it.  Even if it's a cum out. 
[04:11:00]  And then we'll suck each other's cum right out  and we'll spit it into each other's mouth.  We'll make out with each other.  That'll show us, Bobby.  Snowball.  We make out.  We make out with our cum  from his ass  in our mouths.  We suck each other's lips  like Prince and Apollonia.  No, I agree.  I think a little bit of show snowballing  would be fun.  That asshole.  Don't listen, then.  I defy you to throw away your XM. 
[04:11:30]  Call up and cancel your sub.  Yeah.  Why don't you go do a podcast, faggot?  Yeah.  That's what I said to you.  Hey, you do a podcast.  Yeah, that's what I do  because sometimes I want to talk.  I have to  because I have to  I have to keep poor Colin alive.  I have to  No, you still have a career, Colin.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Yeah, we're out.  Out.  Out.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Bob, thank you.  Thanks for having me in.  I'll see you guys Saturday night.  We're going to have a big show.  No, we're not.  Why not?  What are we plugging? 
[04:12:00]  We're plugging the  well, Friday I'm at the venue  in Gainesville, Florida  but then I'm flying right back  to do the Philly show.  I didn't take a leak  all day.  Camden, New Jersey.  Camden, New Jersey.  The safest place in America  to do a show for  12,000 white people  to come to.  All day.  What's wrong with me?  Murder capital of the world.  It is.  You're doing a show, right?  You did earlier.  How many times did you leak?  I didn't take a leak at all.  He probably didn't drink  a lot of fluids.  He drank a whole bottle  of Canada Dry  like an old Jewish guy  playing gin. 
[04:12:30]  I didn't drink any of it.  Yeah, my voice is getting  scratchy.  I want Camden to dry.  I got to take piss.  It's been bad.  You going to piss right now?  Right now.  Right now.  I'm doing it as we speak.  If you pissed your pants  that would be hilarious.  Wouldn't it?  Not wouldn't.  My friend would be embarrassed.  Would it, Bob?  I get it.  Would it?  Yes.  Opie had a mood swing.  He wants to punch  that guy in the face.  Oh, no.  I don't care.  You don't?  I really don't.  It makes it interesting  for the show  so I bring that.  I'll tear down a wall.  It makes it interesting  for the show 
[04:13:00]  so I bring it into  the discussion.  If that guy  get a hold of yourself  you swung a racket  and hit a green ball, sissy.  Where's the legacy?  This girl's sport  was so good to me.  All right.  What?  Well.  Oh, wait.  They're talking about it  on The View.  They must have some good stuff  to say about this.  Please, someone insult me.  And I have found generosity.  Hey, Jim.  You have given me  your shoulders  to stand on.  Oh, God.  Dreams I could have 
[04:13:30]  never reached without you.  Over the last 21 years  I have found you  and I will take you  and the memory of you  with me  for the rest of my life.  Yeah, if you really feel like that  why don't you buy them all dinner,  Andre?  How'd they find cancer  in a storm?  Why is the singer from Live  flying in a tennis ball?  I figured it out.  Standing ovation.  Yeah, standing ovation  at the U.S.  His asshole  looks like a triangular  thing, U.S. tennis center  they named it after Billy D.K.  Is that a three, Angela? 
[04:14:00]  Shut it.  When he talks about success,  I mean, to most people,  success would be  you won, you won, you won.  There's a whole other definition  of what becoming a successful person.  Now, Rosie, shut her up.  He's one of the most successful  philanthropists out there.  He opened an entire school  in Las Vegas.  You should Google  what he's done  with his foundation.  What is this Google?  Can you Google?  Barbara can Google.  Let's do a production number.  Barbara can Google.  Barbara can Google.  Oh, my dear.  I'm loving Rosie. 
[04:14:30]  I'm taking over.  It's bugging Barbara.  Live performers,  not just artists,  but performers.  He is a performer.  And you sort of feel  very close to them  as we do to our audience.  Right, because, you know,  you follow their arc.  Celebrities nowadays  in our culture  are sort of like the metaphors  that people use  to, you know,  bounce off what they think  about themselves  and to watch this man  who has made the journey  from a young kid  who was obsessed  and pushed him  to be the best  and then he got to be the best  and he wanted to design it.  He was a bratty.  I mean, his way of handling success  is a way a lot of young people 
[04:15:00]  and some older ones  to handle success  by being tip-a-pop  by being...  No, I've never seen  an old man's ass.  You were going to ask me.  And what he's talked about.  The loyalty,  the love of his...  Barbara has a mullet.  When is Barbara going to talk?  The kids in the box,  did you see that?  I know.  I know they can play.  The cutest little cheeks.  I mean, have you seen  a commercial where you play  those things?  I'm talking about Jimmy.  I'm talking like  and the old lady.  I see another adoption there.  Shut the fuck up, Bob.  She's bringing back flashbacks.  You feel like the blonde girl? 
[04:15:30]  Fuck you.  Shut up, Bobby.  Oh, Bobby.  Don't rain on my parade.  Let me get a salt of it.  I wasn't.  I was one of them to speak.  All right, we could go on forever.  I could watch this.  Oh, I know, I know.  But we're going to get out of here.  Thanks, guys.  Bob, thanks.  We'll see you Saturday  at the Camden Tweeter Show.  Bring your gun down in Philly.  The O&A traveling virus.  You're saying the day wrong.  Saturday.  Saturday.  Saturday.  Saturday.  Ten comedians. 
[04:16:00]  Ten comedians.  One show.  One show.  One show.  One show.  One show.  One show.  One show.  Broadcasting live from WISP Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Saturday.  Oh, my God.  Let's go.  Sunday.  The Myrtle capital of the country.  Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, Thursday.  And girls.  This is nonsense.  Girls are going to be there.  It's going to be fun.  I want to wow.  I'm tired.  Was it Saturday or Friday?  Saturday, right? 
[04:16:30]  Hopi.  Is it Saturday?  I hope a Triantula bites you.  Is it a Triantula?  Why are you talking to me?  Triantula.  I'm asking you if it's Saturday.  We stopped broadcasting.  Stop talking to me.  Look at it.  I'm not stupid.  I see the lights on.  You got me last week.  But we stopped broadcasting.  I'm done.  No, you're not.  My party show's done.  The fucking music play.  Don't talk to me anymore.  The music play.  You know the rules.  The Triantula, dude.  Dude, the thing's got it.  I prefer, but it's not deadly.  It's a version.  You know a Triantula can't bite you if you hold your hand open straight.  Yeah, it can, huh?  Really?  No.  Yeah, with those fangs, they can't just bang down on you. 
[04:17:00]  They can't.  Oh, you mean the fingers?  Yeah, the stingray can't fucking stab you in the heart either.  Yeah.  Why are you going to get so Italian, Anthony, at the end of the show?  Hey, I don't know why, huh?  A motherfucker.  Yeah.  Hey, I take that Stingray and a piece of bread.  I make a fucking nacho sandwich.  I'll show him.  I'll whack that Stingray.  Hey, Steve Irwin, rest in peace.  Hey, hey, hey.  Thoughts, thoughts, and prayers.  He's just fucking leaving.  Of course he is.  I said I was done broadcast.  Where's Don?  Bye-bye.  I'll make a sandwich. 
[04:17:30]  I take some ice cream.  He might make a bagadouche.  A bagadouche.  A bagadouche.  Hey, you pass me some of the casasazone.  What?  A casasazone.  Triantula.  It's a triantula.  Triantula.  What is it?  Say what it is.  It's a tarantula.  Oh, that too.  There's two, you know.  Tarantella.  Triantula is when there's three of them.  There you are.  Damn it.  I had a dramatic outing.  I forgot my pen, and I have to get it.  Oh, now you look all awkward, coming back. 
[04:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  Well, it's not a Mont Blanc.  Can't you get another one?  It's not about...  A what?  Mont Blanc.  It's not about the actual pen.  Yeah, I got one.  Why would you have an expensive fucking pen?  Exactly.  You never use it.  I use it all the fucking time.  For what?  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  What do you use a pen for?  Just get the shit out of here.  What do you use an expensive pen for?  To write.  Why?  What's wrong?  Get out of here with your fucking ass.  What's the difference between an expensive pen and a fucking Bic?  I can understand a nice watch,  because it's kind of a status thing.  I don't know.  You're not pulling out with your fucking Boston hat 
[04:18:30]  and your t-shirt.  You're not pulling out a big pen  to sign a fucking multi-million dollar contract  with an expensive pen.  I'd sign that with fucking...  You'd do that with a fucking Bic pen.  Really?  You can.  No, you don't.  I don't understand why you need an expensive pen.  Because it represents something.  What?  Well, I don't know.  Fucking samurai sword, fucking...  I don't sign papers.  I'm just saying that an expensive pen  seems like a silly thing to have.  You have a house that you need intercoms in.  I have a fucking pen.  I don't have an expensive pen.  I have a pen.  That's what I can afford. 
[04:19:00]  Hey, huh?  How about your casasone?  All right, look.  I've had it.  I got a piss.  I'm going to get you a pen.  You guys can now...  I'm going to get you a pen.  ...do your own show.  I'm leaving with Opie.  Where are you going?  Well, not with Opie, but...  But we said we were done.  All right.  How long ago?  It was fun, though.  Wait.  Oh, this corner really stinks.  Oh.  Yeah, use the banana like a pen.  It's funny.  Where are you guys going?  You laugh.  Hey.  I'm done.  Usually you ask me my...  Tomorrow.  Hey, what's up, Dan? 
[04:19:30]  How you doing, man?  The show's been done for a while, right?  Are we still on?  Is it still going?  This is nice.  Fuck.  This is easy shit.  I could do this.  You sit in front of a microphone.  You talk about stuff.  Give me a topic.  Okay.  Give me a topic.  All right.  What do you got there?  Some highlighted stuff?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  What do we got?  So, all right. 
[04:20:00]  Hmm.  Liza Minnelli, huh?  That's crazy stuff.  She got a transmitted disease, man.  Wow.  Accusing cabaret style.  Wow.  Who...  Ahem.  So, you transmit stuff.  What kind of disease is she...  That's a shit story.  Oh, thanks.  Here we go.  This is what we're talking now.  I'll do this.  The crazed boyfriend cut down three generations of women in the Bronx family yesterday, 
[04:20:30]  killing his girlfriend and mother before turning his gun on himself.  They always turn it on themselves.  Why don't they be a fucking man and do the time, huh?  You know?  You kill the bitches and then just man up.  You never know.  We might understand.  Right?  Ahem.  Anything else?  This is it?  Thanks.  Floranthropist.  How do you say it?  Floranthropist?  Alright, well... 
[04:21:00]  I guess that's it.  Bye, uh...  Bye, everybody.  Fucking I suck.  I really stink.  Want to go to the phones, Bob?  Yeah, let's go to a phone.  Go ahead.  Uh, Randy from Cleveland.  Go ahead.  Hey, Bob.  I just wanted to say, man, to throw a talk to you.  You're one of the funniest comedians I've ever heard.  Ah, thanks, kid.  How are you?  What's his name?  Randy?  Not you.  Ah, you motherfucker.  Who do we else we got?  That sounded genuine to you? 
[04:21:30]  You didn't think that was going to go that way?  Well, I was kind of hoping that it'd be a nice one.  Go ahead.  Who do we else we got?  Uh, we got some reviews from Tim.  Go ahead.  Tim from North Carolina.  Go ahead, man.  Tim, go ahead.  Shoot, kid.  You're on the air.  Hey, Bob.  This is going pretty good.  That's what I say.  Shoot.  That's when you come on.  That's my catchphrase.  Oh, shit.  You got me again.  Okay.  All right.  There goes Tim.  Let's get another one from Steve.  Steve, shoot.  Hey, uh, Bob.  Listen, I'm trying to figure out, do I go crunchy or smooth with a peanut butter sandwich? 
[04:22:00]  What would you prefer?  Or, and I'll hang up and listen to your answer, but do you cut quarter to quarter, side to  side, and do you leave the crust on, or do you take it off?  Good question.  Good question.  Crunchy.  Shit.  Uh, Sonny Ferrelli.  Shoot, Sonny.  Shoot.  Hey, fucking Bob.  Bob, you fucking suck, man.  You take that fucking pen and sign a contract somewhere else there, buddy.  All right, you fucking Boston shithead.  Could you try to...  I love it, Bob.  I love you, too. 
[04:22:30]  Goodbye.  Go Red Sox.  Yeah.  All right, thanks, Sonny.  Thanks.  Dan.  Dan from Virginia.  Yeah, he blow.  Good offer, right here.  Yeah, no shit.  Fucking pedophile.  Uh, the reviews are mixed.  I don't think they're mixed at all.  I think I should be a guest, and that they should really pace that out over, like, a six-month  period.  All right, fuckheads.  I'm getting off the air, because you guys are a bunch of fucking mean douchebags.  Come on, stick around a little bit.  You hurt feelings. 
[04:23:00]  That's what you are.  You hurt my feelings, and all I am, I'm trying to make you laugh.  That's it, Dan.  No, don't quit yet, Bob.  I'm quitting.  I'm out of here.  We got, uh, Steve from New Jersey wants to say hello.  What?  Go ahead, Steve.  I love Jersey.  Hi.  Go ahead.  Shoot.  Dude, why are they giving you such a hard time?  How come you're not going to get your own show?  You were actually very funny after tourgazing.  Ah, well, thanks, man.  I appreciate that, dude.  Uh, yeah.  RUN!  Get this fat jerk off off the air! 
[04:23:30]  RUN!  Bob Kelly should be eating Dan Cook's asshole!  Well, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know if that, I don't know if that  was...  RUN!  Get this middle off the radio!  I'm just trying to, uh...  Do you know it takes more emotions to frown than it does to do a snub? 
[04:24:00]  Why don't you try it, Bobby?  Well, that's, uh, that's one way to go.  All right, well, this is Rob Kelly.  Uh, thanks for listening to XM, Opie and Anthony.  Uh, remember MySpace and, uh, Robert Kelly Live and I'll be in Gainesville this Friday night.  Don't tag our name onto this horse shit!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, goodbye!  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with
