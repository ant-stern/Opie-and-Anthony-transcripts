<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic review of the previous night's celebrity telethon/tribute to America.  The hosts and callers dissected the performances of Mariah Carey (including a mention of her film *Glitter*), Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, and Muhammad Ali, focusing on their appearances and demeanor. Ron and Fez's simulcast commentary was praised for its humor.  Billy Joel’s performance was added to the "Do Not Play" list, and Fred Durst's overexposure was mocked.  A review of *Hardball* (starring Keanu Reeves) was also included.

Will and Shannon, winners of *Big Brother 2*, then joined the show in studio.  Their relationship, formed on the show, was discussed, alongside Will's strategic gameplay and the impact of 9/11 on the *Big Brother* broadcast.  Callers shared opinions on the contestants, including Hardy and Bunky.  A vulgar, anti-Osama Bin Laden poem by John Valby was mentioned.  A Michael Douglas film trailer was played, and the hosts promoted "Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed."  Barry Williams (Greg Brady) was announced as an upcoming guest, and a new song, "Angry Young Earl," was teased.  Shannon's toothbrush-toilet-cleaning incident was recounted as a humorous *Big Brother* moment. The conversation then turned sexually explicit, involving discussions of Bunky's masturbation, a potential nude photoshoot for Shannon, Playboy, and other reality TV personalities' physical attributes.

The impending appearance of the "Penis Puppeteers," a genital manipulation performance art act, became a major topic.  The hosts attempted to convince a reluctant Earl to participate, leading to an angry exchange and a profane song about Earl's temper.  More listener calls, further discussion about the Penis Puppeteers, and Barry Williams' arrival followed.  Williams shared comedic anecdotes about being Greg Brady, his experience on *The Weakest Link*, and other experiences, often interspersed with crude humor and sexual innuendo from the hosts.  The hosts also attempted to get female staff members involved with the Penis Puppeteers' act to offset the expected explicitness.

Barry Williams' segment heavily featured the Penis Puppeteers, David and Simon, two Australian performers who create shapes with their genitalia (such as a hamburger, the Loch Ness Monster, the Eiffel Tower, and a snail).  They detailed their act, audience reactions, and the technical aspects of their performance.  A caller mentioned a rumor about a never-aired *Brady Bunch* scene involving the brothers manipulating their genitals for money. A pre-recorded clip showed "Stalker Patty" retrieving concert tickets from Ron Jeremy's pants. Advertisements for Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, Pinnacle horny goat weed, and New York Sports Clubs aired. The show concluded with further discussion about the Penis Puppeteers' upcoming performances at the John Houseman Theatre.

The final segment began with a humorous discussion of crude and anatomically impossible sexual acts depicted in novelty items, such as a "baby bird" and a "windsurfer."  This transitioned into a profane and sarcastic critique of the US response to 9/11 and the military actions in the Middle East, mocking "Operation Infinite Justice" and the perceived inadequacy of freezing assets.  The hosts contrasted this with Mike and the Mad Dog's perceived trivialization of the situation, referencing a newspaper article, "Drive Time Dribble."  Barry Williams called in again with further commentary before leaving the show. Numerous callers engaged in crude banter throughout this segment, which ended with a heavily profane "Angry Young Earl" segment overlaid with Billy Joel’s “Angry Young Man.”


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, Neil Young getting us started today from Friday  night, that was from the star-studded celebrity telethon, tribute to America, yes Anthony,  which I want to right off the bat say, I sure hope for your sake, here in New York and wherever  else they're heard, you were listening to Ron and Fez as they did a simulcast of the telethon 
[00:00:30]  and talked over it. Because if you were watching at home with the sound turned down and listening  to Ron and Fez, it was hysterical. Kudos and hats off to Ron and Fez for their simulcast.  They gave me the needed comedy relief there. Yeah. Because it was teary eyeballs for everybody  if you were watching Friday. Yeah. But Ron and Fez in New York, yeah, they told everyone 
[00:01:00]  to keep their show on. So I immediately put my headphones on and I had them tuned in while  I was watching the telethoncast. And when Tom Petty came out and Ron goes, Paul, he's morphing  into Greg Allman. Greg Allman. And my favorite was Mariah, the line with Mariah when Mariah  stopped singing and turned her head so I was like, what is she doing? And Ron's like,  uh-oh, here it comes. Here we go. Uh-oh, here we go. It was hysterical. Great job from Ron 
[00:01:30]  and Fez. Yeah, because I don't know if I would have been able to watch all two hours of that.  Yeah, it was really like sad and depressing. Not that it was supposed to be a happy occasion  or something. But, you know, they'd go from the celebrity speeches where they would give  their little, you know, pro-American, anti-terrorist kind of thing, sorrow and support, and then  go into a song. You know, someone performing a song that was usually not very upbeat either.  It was just made for two very depressing hours. And Ron and Fez kind of helped out there. 
[00:02:00]  Definitely helped it out. Tim, what's going on?  Guys, what's up? Hey. Listen, I got three fast points about the show on Friday. Yeah.  Number one, remember last week we covered about this Do Not Play list? Yeah. All right.  Did anybody tell Billy Joel about New York State of Mind? Yeah. Well, I'm a flight to  Miami Beach. I went, eww. Yeah, I know. Well, he did a great job with this song. He did. I want  to know what happened to his hair the last two years. What happened to him? Well, he's getting  older. He's been around forever, but his hair was hanging in there. Wow. He was hanging in there.  Well, now I got two more points. He's had a tough year. When your chick leaves you and 
[00:02:30]  then starts banging guys that are on Survivor or whatever the hell the guy was on. Was  that Survivor? Yeah. Yeah. And that guy started banging his wife or girlfriend. Showing the  doctor, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I got another point. Was I the only one looking at Mariah Carey's  wrists? Yeah. When she came out, I'm like, come on, she's got to lose her mind. She's got  to lose her mind. She's going to freak right here on national television. I was on the edge of  my seat thinking she could just completely lose it at any second. And then, like Ann 
[00:03:00]  said, all of a sudden, she stopped singing and kind of turned to her backup singers real  fast. I went, I was at home going, oh, no. This is it right here. Now, the last point,  can you guys tell me that I'm not true in thinking this, that Willie Nelson and Tom Petty  were separated at birth? God, you see them side by side during America the Beautiful? Yeah.  That was so sad how they ended with Willie Nelson and all the celebrities trying to sing  along. Goldie Hawn was singing another song. I don't know what the hell she was singing. 
[00:03:30]  She was way off. Yeah. Anyone else notice that? Way off. But then I'm thinking maybe because  it was simulcast in L.A. and New York, and I think Willie was singing in New York that maybe  it was a little behind in L.A. or something. All I saw was Goldie Hawn singing what looked  like another song. Yeah. And I know a lot of people from the New York area and wherever  we broadcast. We broadcast in 15 cities now. Uh-huh. I know someone must have called in 
[00:04:00]  and talked to one of the celebrities. Oh, yeah. Come on. Who talked to Tom Cruise? Or Brad  Pitt? Jack Nicholson. Or N.O.P. Cruz? Or Adam Sandler? Saw them all sitting at the phone  bank? I have a feeling they weren't talking to anyone that whole show. Is there a, is there  a, I need one person to call and tell me they talked to a celebrity? They spoke to  a celebrity. I don't think those phones were plugged in. I think there was a phone bank  somewhere else. I think they were talking to each other. Yeah, Adam Sandler was talking  to Jack Nicholson. They were making deals with each other. They were networking with each 
[00:04:30]  other. Hey, I got an idea for a movie. You want to talk about it? You come to my premiere  or I'll go to yours. Yeah. All right, guys. Thanks, Tim. Take care. All right. Bye. And there  was just a big bank of phones somewhere in the basement that people were manning. Regular  folk. Another observation right off the bat here about the telethon or whatever they're  calling us the tribute to America on Friday. Yeah. Does Fred Durst have to be on every  single TV show? Yeah. Fred is a complete whore. I mean, I like the guy. He means well.  He did a great version of Wish You Were Here with Johnny there from the Goo Goo Dolls. Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  But he is on every TV show. Everything. How does he do it? Mm-hmm. Did you see him on  Mad TV? Huh? Did you watch Mad TV? I missed it. Oh, Frank Caliendo's first appearance.  I'm going to need a tape. On Mad TV. I forgot all about that. It did Pacino. Was he good?  Starring in Glitter, you know, with Mariah Carey. Mariah. Yeah, he was good. It's kind  of weird. Frank does the Pacino voice great. But when you make him up like Pacino, looks 
[00:05:30]  like quite the little chubby Pacino. You know what I mean? So I'm waiting for them to have  him do Madden because they'll be able to dress him up as Madden really well. But Fred Durst,  they had a couple of people from Mad TV at a red carpet for, god damn, if I can't even  remember the event it was at. One of those, you know. Oh, I think it was the premiere of  Rockstar. That's what it was. And Fred Durst came up and started talking to the people from  Mad TV. But his face, you're right, is on everything. Every show. It's like, oh, there's  Fred. You cannot turn on the TV without seeing Fred Durst at least once. Yeah. Hey, what the 
[00:06:00]  hell? God love him. Has anybody seen Glitter? Oh, God love them. Glitter? Yeah. I don't think  anyone. It made only 2.5 million. One star. The number one movie, they say the box office  took a beating. The number one movie, that baseball one with Keanu Reeves. Hardball. Yeah.  Made 8 million and some change. I liked it better when it was called Bad News Bears. Bad News  Bears. Exactly. Or Mighty Ducks. Well, it's the black equivalent to that. Well. Because there  are a bunch of black children. It looks like a good movie. I walked by my movie theater 10 
[00:06:30]  times going, I just want to go to a movie. I didn't want to see anything. Without the Tatum  O'Neill character, though, I shan't be spending my money on that. Yeah. Or what's  his name? Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, the guy that hit the homers. Oh, yeah. He was Kelly. Kelly.  No. I know his real name is, uh. Kelly, right. He smoked. Smoked on his little, uh,  rrrr. You can't get enough feel-good movies, though. Like, you know when a gang of kids  are like ragamuffins and the coach helps them? I mean, boy, I never get so old. Because 
[00:07:00]  God knows what's going to happen. Hopefully they win, but who knows? Yeah. But you can't  top the Bad News Bears. Walter Matthau had the kids drinking beer. Drinking beer and cursing  and stuff. You know damn well Keanu Reeves doesn't have the kids drinking and smoking  dope and stuff. I think he has them smoking crack, which is good. You know, kind of like  the updated version of the Bad News Bears. Prostituting himself. Yeah, a little prostitution  and maybe you get a better player. Something. This guy's claiming he talked to Brad Pitt.  Mike. Yo, Renee. Hey. What up, Jim? What's up? Yeah, I did talk to Brad Pitt, but he said 
[00:07:30]  the one rule of the telethon is you do not talk about the telethon. I don't think anyone  talked to a celebrity. I don't either. There's got to be, uh, 50,000 people listening to us  right now that called in. Yeah. One of them had to have talked to a celebrity, right? I  would think so. Does anybody know if the team wins in the Keanu Reeves movie? I mean,  I don't want to blow it for anybody, but I can't, I can't, you know, I got to find 
[00:08:00]  out. I can't wait. Someone is going to overcome something. Yeah, that's got to be really emotional.  You know, when they finally win and the kids are doing good, thank God. Isn't that great?  God bless them all. Yeah, that's where I feel. Dennis, what's up? Hey, Celine Dion singing  God Bless America. What the F is up with that? Well, she did a good job, but we can't find  an American to sing the... God bless America. Even though I'm from Canada, my home, sweet  Tom. I was looking for the camel toe, couldn't find it in her black dress. Nah. Well, she  gained a few pounds because she had that kid. So she's... She had the kid, so I think all 
[00:08:30]  the meat around the area has puffed up enough to get rid of the camel toe, which was kind  of hanging down. Gravity taking its toll at an early age with her. Ray, what's up? Yeah,  I was wondering what Stallone didn't give any speeches. They drew first blood. It was  having started it. They did it. Not me. They drew first blood. That would be good, a little  Rambo speech. One of the Rambo movies, wasn't he on the Afghanistan side? Yes, that was the 
[00:09:00]  last Rambo. Rambo what? Eight or whatever it was? I think it was... Was it three? I think  they only made three, right? They made up to three, right? Rambo three, and he was in Afghanistan  helping the Afghani rebels... Against the Russians. ...fight the Soviets. Now, the  rebels at that time were the same people that are Bin Laden and his supporters. So there  was Rambo training with them and eating with them, playing with them, having fun, and fighting  the awful, evil Russians. I just want to say, like, don't rent Rocky III or Rambo III. I can't 
[00:09:30]  remember what the movie I said. Because he showed me what you have again. He said, it  looks pretty unpatriotic. Ah! I just want to say, that we didn't start this. They started  it! They drew first blood! Ah! Ah! I'm going to go over there and give them all the Cleveland 
[00:10:00]  steamers. Ah! Ah! Ah! And me. Rambo. Yeah, rent Rambo III and see how relevant it is today.  Whoops. Wait a minute. Everything's changed. Hey, Nick, you're next on the Opie and Anthony  show. What's up? Hey, guys. Real quick note on Willie Nelson. Am I the only one that thinks  he's starting to look more and more like Obi-Wan Kenobi? Especially on the close ups? That's all  I feel like I'm going to go. 
[00:10:30]  That's pretty good.  That was just so sad Friday night.  These are not the droids you're looking for.  And what is going on with Clint Eastwood's body?  Anyone notice that?  What?  His suit was too big for him, and it was lumping out over here.  You saw Bridges of Madison County, and that was years ago.  What do you think?  That got better?  I don't know.  It looks like the guy when he's at the water tower thing, the water pump,  and he's bathing himself with his shirt off,  and Meryl Streep is looking out the window diddling, 
[00:11:00]  and it looked like he had, I don't know, pieces of meat hanging from him.  That didn't get better over time.  He has baloney boobs.  Right.  Ah, Joe, what's going on?  Hey, how about Neil Diamond as Rambo?  Shut up. 
[00:11:30]  You should do that every single day.  That's the funniest thing I've heard.  You guys suck.  Neil Diamond will be making an appearance on the show today.  You never know when he pops up.  Yes.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Guys, tell me Muhammad Ali didn't look like he was cranking his meat.  Oh, my God.  They had to pan up with the camera.  Get it off his way.  They started out with a full shot, and it went immediately right to his head.  Mike, are you insane?  His hand was like this.  Are you insane?  He's got smoldering Joe Frazier fist prints all over his brain. 
[00:12:00]  And you know something?  I love when they have the written quotes in the paper, magazine, websites,  that Muhammad Ali says.  They sound very inspirational and nice, you know,  about how he's been a Muslim for many years,  and this is not against the Muslim people.  And he just, he has a nice rap in print, you know,  when the guy's got an hour to write it down.  Well, his mind's all there.  He just can't express himself.  Dude, who wanted to see them drag him out on stage Friday and listen to him? 
[00:12:30]  You don't understand, though, man.  When America needs to cry, they break the glass,  and they bring Muhammad Ali out.  Let's not forget him at the Olympics with the torch.  Oh, my God.  It's an eyeball moment.  Excuse me, can't we remember, you know,  and I'm going to take Joe Frazier,  and I'm going to say,  I'm the thriller, it's the thriller in Manila.  You don't remember that?  Who the hell wants to see him?  Hi, there.  Foam like a cinder block and sting like foam rubber. 
[00:13:00]  Foam rubber.  I inhale too much decon fog off.  Well, we have the clip.  That's awful.  We should play it.  We have Muhammad Ali talking.  Yeah, he came out with Will Smith, so here we go.  Heroes come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and religions.  This man might be the most famous person in the world.  Who?  He's one of the greatest heroes of our time.  Where is he?  And he is a Muslim.  It was hate, not religion, 
[00:13:30]  that motivated the horrible acts of September 11th.  Hate by a religion.  And in the wake of these events,  nothing could be more un-American  than to respond to mindless hatred with blind vengeance.  I still hate the same people I hated before.  My friend and I, I want you to remember that.  I just want to state that.  And that we are strongest when we stand together.  Meanwhile, Muhammad's shaking like a car on bad gas.  I'm here because of the terrible thing that happened the other day. 
[00:14:00]  I'm a Muslim.  I've been a Muslim for 20 years.  And I'm against killing, violence, and all Muslims are against it.  I think people should know the real truth about Islam.  You know me.  I'm a boxer.  I'm a boxer.  I'm called the greatest of all time.  Oh, my God.  People recognize me for being a boxer and a man of truth. 
[00:14:30]  And I wouldn't be here if it was in Islam.  What?  It was really like the terrorists made it look.  I think that all the people should know the truth  and come to recognize the truth  because Islam is peace against killing, murder,  and the terrorists and the people doing that in the name of Islam are wrong.  And if I had a chance, I'd do something about it. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Who the hell would laugh at this thing?  I'm here.  Calm down.  Shut up.  You sick F.  If I could do something, I'd do something about it.  Isn't that sad that, like, any one of us could walk up to Muhammad Ali  and just knock him out?  But you know it doesn't.  Isn't that ironic?  Isn't it ironic?  Don't you think?  Don't you think? 
[00:15:30]  John, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys don't realize this is a Will Smith-Muhammad Ali thing.  It's a publicist's wet dream.  They've been trying to get the Muhammad Ali movie  starring Will Smith off the ground for a year and a half now.  Ah, there you go.  They're filming that around, I think, right?  That's what I'm saying.  It's done.  Let's see through the travesty of irony here.  All right.  Let's do that.  Shall we?  Let's look right through the travesty of irony.  Will, what's up?  What's my ex-wife's back?  Yo, did you guys know this Tom Cruise at the end of the show?  No.  He was waving his hands around. 
[00:16:00]  He kept singing the same song over and over again.  He's like, when are we going to get this done with him?  Penelope Cruz is standing there holding his arm.  I'm like, come on, stop.  Well, you know that.  He doesn't want to go F that.  Yeah, he wanted to get back to banging her.  You know?  He's like, how much longer are we going to go on with this?  Heterosexuality never felt so good.  If he is.  If he is, my friend.  Wow.  Come on.  All right, Will.  Thank you.  I think he goes both ways, boys and men.  You know, the important thing, I think, is when the country's having problems, we always  turn to Will Smith. 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  Don't we?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, he saved the world once, so.  Men in Black 2 having to change some of their stuff around because of the World Trade Center.  There's some big action scene going to take place at the base of the World Trade Center.  Oh.  They should keep all those scenes.  They absolutely should.  What the hell?  They really should.  I hope they don't redo the whole Spider-Man movie.  Well, they pulled a trailer that shows the helicopter getting caught in Spider-Man's  web between the World Trade Center.  Oh, that would be so tight.  I know.  It's like a tribute. 
[00:17:00]  It's not going to be a bad thing.  You're going to notice that it's missing than you would if it was there.  I kind of like the idea.  I was looking at a bunch of websites over the weekend, just historical pictures of them  building the World Trade Center.  And it's pretty cool.  You see the base of it and the familiar architecture on the outside and cranes.  They're building the goddamn thing.  There's the workers on there and you kind of hope we get to see that again.  And I was looking at old pictures that somehow dragged me through off of pornography. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know how that happens when I'm on the Internet, but sometimes I go completely  off of porno pages.  And I was looking at the 1964 World's Fair from New York City and they had a view of the  skyline from one of the pavilions.  It's the same skyline we have now.  It was.  It's like, wow, man, you're looking down there and it's a pre-World Trade Center.  You look at the Empire State Building now.  You're like, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  He regained his title.  Let's go to Chris. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, Chris.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Apparently, Kelsey Grammer went after, I'm sorry, Ali went after Kelsey Grammer during  the thing.  I'm going to whoop Frazier.  I'm going to whoop Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Well, I heard Frazier's here.  He's looking pale.  What, you got that Michael Jackson disease?  I'm all for Frazier.  You don't look as good as you used to.  What happened to Frazier?  You guys felt great.  Goddamn, dude. 
[00:18:30]  That is funny.  That is good.  Kelsey Grammer.  Hey, Frazier, what happened to your afro?  You're the thriller in vanilla now, Whitey.  Well, we should take a break.  I want to play the John Valby poem.  I don't know where it is.  If we can find that really fast.  On the show today, right around the corner, Barry Williams.  The real Greg Brady.  Greg coming in today.  Barry?  He does some great radio with us, and we can't wait to have him on. 
[00:19:00]  I want to hear the Brady reaction to this.  How would the Bradys have handled a situation like this?  Fascinating.  I smell bit.  Also, the winner of Big Brother 2, Will, in studio today.  Yes.  I think he's going to be here in about 10 minutes, so we'll hang with him.  And, well, we have lots to do, but right around the corner, I think it's just about done.  Can we say what it is?  Yeah.  I guess it doesn't matter.  Rick's been working for about three hours on...  Which is about two and a half hours overtime for Rick. 
[00:19:30]  Rick, is it done?  Yeah, I've just put the last couple of beats in.  Can we debut it next after commercials?  We might be able to, yeah.  How much do you want to bet it misses a beat, and we have to dump out of the song?  I sure hope you hit every single one of them, Rick.  We're talking about a song called Angry Young Earl.  It's really good.  Angry Young Earl.  It's very funny.  And we're going to do that in a few minutes. 
[00:20:00]  I'm stalling because I want to play the Bin Laden thing.  Can't find it?  No.  Valby's?  What do you think we have is the Taliban blues?  No.  We want the poem.  Valby's poem that he just puts in different Mideaster villains.  Like the same poem he used for Gaddafi.  Yeah.  And everyone else.  As we go to break, our buddy John Valby from Buffalo.  We're heard on WBUF in Buffalo these days.  I know that.  And we're getting e-mail from Toronto, Canada, Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  So I want to say hi to everyone listening to us in Toronto today.  Home of the Bernardos.  The what?  Paul Bernardo and Carla Homolka.  Oh, thanks.  And a couple other people.  Here's to Osama Bin Laden.  That towelhead scum.  May the U.S. blast his ass to Kim Kim.  He's a bagless wonder that lives in a cave. 
[00:21:00]  May Marines buttweiser on that suckers guy.  Osama, being a chicken faggot, lives off camel turds with a topping of maggots.  Osama thinks we don't have the guts to come and blow off his Islamic nuts.  But now America is done with his crap.  So let's just move the f**kers off the map. 
[00:21:30]  So here's to Osama, that son of a b**ch.  May this p***** ball up with a seven-year ips.  And he may bid on his b***** with a big brass hammer  till his a**hole whistles the star-spangled banner.  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens 
[00:22:00]  that you can see from the streets of Manhattan?  What a day for new teens!  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the voyeur bus.  Billy, I need to read it!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  From 20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises.  Michael Douglas.

A couple phone numbers if you're in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else in the country.  866-277-4WOW.  We went to the Black Crow Show on Saturday.  Yeah.  It was alright.  The sound sucked.  Will and sad.  Where were you?  Were you up in the balcony?  Couldn't get good seats.  Thanks, K-Rock. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, is that where you...  I thought that's where you got the tickets from.  We snuck some tickets from K-Rock and, boy, they take care of their listeners over there.  They didn't know it was you?  We were so way up in the rafters.  They didn't know it was your tickets?  No, we were just regular schmoes.  Man.  We were like, you know, contest winners.  The evil dictator didn't give you better seats?  No, I don't think so.  Napoleon?  The Abercrombie and Fitch Midget?  Anthony, say hi to Will and Shannon.  Look, they're already getting shot. 
[00:25:30]  What's up, man?  How you doing?  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  These two hooked up in the house.  Apparently, yeah.  See, tell me.  Anthony watched a lot of Big Brother, too.  You would have.  You would have known we were hooking up.  I know.  Yeah.  You missed out, man.  It rocked.  I know.  Opie completely took care of watching.  I picked Will to win it from the beginning.  I've been getting a lot of that.  And I was praying.  But I was like, there's no way this guy's going to win because everyone hated him off the bat.  It's true.  Did he take me to win?  Well, you had a really nice body in the house at the show.  No, because he's a cannot. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, he was unbelievable.  He had the whole house hating him, and they didn't kick him out.  Wow.  How do you pull that off?  I'm just used to it.  You know, I go to people's house, and they hate me, and I just stick around.  I just practice staying in people's house.  So how did you not get thrown out?  I don't know, man.  Well, then he would kiss up to people and act like he really cared about their stupid lives.  And then behind their back, he would, like, trash them to the camera.  It was great.  It was beautiful, actually.  That's pretty much the gist of it.  Yeah.  And how did you two hook up there? 
[00:26:30]  Well, you know, CBS just played basically a big dating game for Will and Shannon, and  we benefited.  He won the money, and I got a hot dude with a doctor, and he's got half a million dollars.  Oh, my gosh.  She blew off her boyfriend.  Yeah.  Wow.  You went in there.  Is it official?  Did you dump him?  Oh, yeah.  Because they didn't really go into that in the final episode of Big Brother, too.  Well, television, I'm like, you have to trade as this.  Now, before you went into the house, you have your boyfriend.  Did you have a conversation, like, all right, baby, I love you, and I'll see you after we  get out? 
[00:27:00]  Well, actually, the conversation was, you have to do what you got to do, and I got to do  what I got to do, because our careers are going different directions.  So CBS just played it up and made it like, you know, oh, well, wow, she's evil, and she  did this and did that.  But before you even went in, it was kind of like, uh-oh.  Yeah.  It wasn't like one of those things where you were going off, and you thought you would come  back out, and you two would still be together.  Even better, Will pretty much told the guy that he's done.  Yeah, I wanted to let him know.  I wanted to let him know.  That's that episode.  I was like, two weeks of the show, like, hey, dude, you just lost your girlfriend, man.  Oh, God, that's harsh.  He was like garbage on Thursday. 
[00:27:30]  Ow!  And he's got to watch it on TV.  Most people get screwed over by their chicks or something.  Well, the worst part is, it just happens, you know?  But you've got to sit there and watch it on TV.  He probably told his family and his friends, he's like, oh, look, there's my girlfriend.  And then I come on, I'm like, hey, uh, you don't have a girlfriend.  Dude, don't watch that show anymore.  Yeah, they're-  Don't watch it.  It sucks, dude.  They're in bed together.  My chicks.  There was some kind of hand movement going on under the blanket that one time.  What was that?  And the internet went crazy.  I think Will's getting a handy.  A handy.  Coming from all the people who never had one, I guess. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, seriously.  That was like early on on the show.  Yeah.  I watched every episode.  I'll admit it.  Thank you.  Hated Nicole.  Hey, back at you.  Hated her.  You used her like a tool.  You were like a little puppet master.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It was awesome.  Dude, there was romance.  There was intrigue.  There was violence.  It was great.  How could you not watch?  I know.  I know.  Well, hindsight 2020.  It's all right, dude.  You know what happened?  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you honestly.  I never recovered from the first one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never recovered from the first one.  You should start a letter writing campaign to replay the whole show in its entirety. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This one?  Yeah.  Definitely.  What do you think, Opie?  Well, the show lost a lot of steam because, you know, we had a little tragedy here.  Yeah, we had a little event down the road.  And all of a sudden, it was like, well, that's reality TV.  No one really cares about Big Brother 2 anymore.  It was kind of sad.  But I was surprised how they told you guys.  Yeah, how they did that.  It was Monica, Will, and Nicole left in the house when the tragedy went on.  And the voice, the Big Brother voice, just casually told you in a very monotone tone what was going on. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, they told us that a plane had been crashed in the World Trade Center and that it was a terrorist attack.  And that was it.  No questions could be answered.  That's it.  That's it.  They didn't tell you how many people died or how many people were missing.  They didn't tell you that the towers were gone.  No, they didn't mention that.  Whoa.  Well, the important thing is that the show go on.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know what's even weird about that.  Monica, I believe, lost a cousin in that.  She has a cousin who's still unaccounted for.  Yeah, and that's all they told her.  That a plane hit the World Trade Center.  They said a plane.  They didn't say how many and the damage, nothing. 
[00:29:30]  No.  But you know what?  In defense of CBS, I'm sure a lot of people felt helpless like they couldn't do anything.  And that's what we were, too.  So it's really not, from an emotional standpoint, all that different than other people.  Yeah, but one of the people in the house, one of the family members was missing.  And that's all.  I would have shown you guys what happened to get your natural reaction right.  But Monica figured that she couldn't do anything if she was here.  Right.  So it was better that she stayed out here and let her family concentrate on the missing loved ones.  I don't know.  It seems to me like, yeah, they should have shown you.  But they didn't even tell her that her cousin was missing at first.  Yeah, no, they said that. 
[00:30:00]  They said she was unaccounted for.  And then, you know, every day they were kind of like, it was a little worse every day.  Right.  So what was your image in your head when that happened?  Did you just see this little meh-err Cessna hitting it?  Yeah, we didn't know.  Like, oh, maybe upwards of ten people got hurt or something.  Well, we didn't know if it was like a hand glider that just bumped into some guy with a banner, you know.  But the thing is, there's a lot less air traffic near us, so we kind of, you know, from that extrapolated it.  Oh, really?  It was pretty bad.  But nonetheless, you know, it really wasn't, you didn't know what to make of it, and we weren't given any other information, so we kind of just were like, well, okay, that's strange. 
[00:30:30]  So what were you thinking the first time you saw the news footage?  Oh, man, I mean, it was incredible.  I left the house, and then I'm starting, I'm still, you know, learning about it now.  I just left the house a few days ago, so it's really, it's very strange, very strange.  I haven't actually seen the footage because apparently it's very difficult to obtain now.  Oh, really?  You know, I read the magazines about it, but I haven't seen any live footage.  There's no words to describe it.  We've seen it eight billion times.  Yeah.  They finally decided to stop playing it.  To our right here, so.  Yeah, it's right down the road.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Lisa. 
[00:31:00]  Lisa, what's up?  Well, I love you.  Lisa, I love you.  Oh, dear.  I watched every show.  I never missed it.  I was rooting for you since day one.  Thank you.  That's very kind of you.  We know you're so not evil.  I appreciate that.  They call them the evil doctor, Anthony.  The evil doctor.  I have to get a life.  Anthony, am I that bad?  I have to get a life.  No, I don't see that.  Okay.  You know, you don't seem like the evil doctor.  Get to know him.  Any evil doctor I've seen in the movie.  Get to know him and don't believe anything he's saying right now.  As long as you don't live with me, I think we'll be fine.  Yes.  I just wanted to say great strategy and thanks for giving me a lot of great nights. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye, we'll love you.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Yeah.  How's that going for you?  Because I know the girls must just be clamoring.  I didn't know anyone was watching.  Like, I really thought, you know, like, it's like my mom said.  I left the house and, you know, she called me on the phone and she's like, listen, you  know, I owe you an apology because you've been an idiot for 28 years and I never thought  it would pay off.  And then, so, you know, people have been pounding that in my head for so long, it's  still me.  And now I leave and kids at the mall want to hug me.  And I'm like, wow, you know, last week you guys didn't want to hug me.  Norton can only dream of kids at the mall wanting to hug him because he goes around  hugging kids at the mall and they run away and call the police. 
[00:32:00]  It's not a bad thing, dude.  It's all right.  They're asking for it.  You should see how they dress.  Let's talk to Will.  What's up?  Hey, Will, you're a despicable man.  Hey, I hated this guy.  You hated him?  I hated this guy on the show.  My girlfriend hated you and I'm like, no, man, this guy's all right.  Good call.  Good call.  Go ahead, Will.  At the end of the show, I turned around a little bit because who was left?  I guess I hated them a little bit more.  Okay, it's all relative.  I wanted to ask, when you bumped off Hardy, was that strategy or was it really because 
[00:32:30]  of what happened with Shannon?  No, I was really thrilled to throw Hardy off.  In fact, it would have made a lot of sense if I kept Hardy to be in the finals against  him.  You know, he was disliked as well.  So, you know, that was just paying him back.  I certainly owed him.  Weren't you worried about him winning the next head of household and bumping you off  though?  Yeah, absolutely.  I was constantly worried about that.  But, you know, I just wanted to make sure I didn't eliminate him too quickly.  Great show.  Great show.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, Will.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Nick.  Hey, Nick.  Hey, Will. 
[00:33:00]  Yo, man.  I was just wondering, the helicopter ride you took with Bunky, did he try to give you  a buck a buck?  Yeah, it was a...  He tried to join the Mile High Club, but I was having nothing to do with it.  Bunky.  All right, cool.  The gay guy.  Right, right.  Every reality show needs one gay guy.  You need the gay guy.  Token.  Bunky's the gayest guy of any show, though.  I mean, come on now.  He can out-compete any gay guy.  Really?  Any gay show guy?  I don't know.  Real World, number one.  That had a real gay guy on.  And then Real World with Pedro.  San Francisco.  I mean, come on.  The guy got married. 
[00:33:30]  That's pretty gay.  Yeah, but Bunky's been married 13 years.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, he's the gayest gay that ever gave him.  Anthony, he's real gay.  He ran around the yard with a blue velvet cape and a yellow bow on his head.  All right, that's pretty gay.  I'll give you that.  And he cried every episode.  Everyone.  Weeping.  It's like it's just a show.  Yeah.  It's just peanut butter.  Calm down.  Yeah.  All right.  What did you think of Justin getting kicked out?  What did they tell you guys?  They told me nothing.  You know, he was a good friend of mine.  He was a good friend of mine on the show. 
[00:34:00]  I really liked him.  He was a lot of fun.  He's from Jersey, man.  He's a Jersey boy.  But that's normal in Jersey, right?  And it's just, that's first grade.  Yeah, exactly.  See, I'm thinking of CBS 1 in ratings.  You keep the guy in the house.  You never know what's going to happen.  I'd watch every freaking night.  I don't know why they did that.  Because from watching it, that I did watch.  And it looked like they were just effing around and stuff.  Yeah, I didn't see anything about that.  In fact, we didn't know why he left.  And then one day he just wasn't there.  And then, you know, three months later, they're like, oh, by the way, he was holding knives to people's throats.  By the way, he was poisoning people in their sleep. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't matter.  Oops, did we forget to tell you that?  Did anyone get it on in the house?  I know everyone asks you guys this.  You know, there was a lot of people were kissing.  You know, it was pretty.  You know, let me tell you who the hottest person in the house was other than Shannon.  You know, there's no saying that Shannon's smoking.  But Sherry is just smoking, you know.  Sherry?  Yeah.  Older lady.  See, she has the breast.  Now has breast cancer.  Well, that is, yeah.  That's unfortunate.  But, you know, nonetheless, her breasts are phenomenal.  And it doesn't have anything to do with the cancer.  Right.  And she's just a hot lady, you know. 
[00:35:00]  Goes without saying.  Makes one bigger.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That's Norton.  He's a sick half.  If you haven't figured it out.  Yeah, that wasn't me.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, O'Neill?  You guys are the best.  All right.  Will, honestly, you made the show.  Thanks a lot, dude.  Yeah, without you, like, once Mike Boogie got thrown out, I'm like, this show's going  to suck.  But you were hilarious on the show.  Hey, I appreciate that.  And why didn't you just punch Hardy in the face, that fag?  Yeah, he was kind of limp, you know.  But the guy was just a wuss.  All right, see you later.  You know, you can beat people physically or mentally. 
[00:35:30]  And I just wanted to break him down slowly.  He cried a lot, too.  Really?  Yeah, he did.  I think I made him cry first.  Yeah, you did.  Yeah, I did.  You broke him down real fast.  I said it, too.  He would cry before I left, and he did twice.  Yeah, you're evil, too.  Shannon's evil.  Oh, yeah, don't kid yourself.  Oh, yeah.  So what do you think of Mike Boogie asking Krista to get married?  It took all your thunder away, man.  What do you think about it?  I'm not really sure.  Well, I thought it was pretty stupid.  You know, I haven't seen them in two months.  It was the final episode of Big Brother 2. 
[00:36:00]  It was just before they were going to announce Will was going to win, and he bounces down on  that knee and asks Krista to marry him.  Really?  And the next day, I've got to tell you, they weren't writing about Will winning Big Brother 2.  Oh, I'm sure.  We're talking about Mike and Krista getting engaged.  Yeah, I mean, I'm all for it.  If they love each other, I think that's wonderful.  That will never last.  No, that's true.  I used to say.  Don't hold back.  Tell us how you feel.  That's what we do on the show.  I love it.  That will never last.  Dennis, what's going on?  Yeah, first I want to say the show went downhill once they got Shannon off. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you so much.  There was nothing beating watching her walk around in a bathing suit.  Well, you know, that says a lot for Hardy, you know, kicking out the chick running  around in a teaback.  I mean, seriously, think about it.  Walked around all the time with just the wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Listen, I'm not a producer at CBS, but if they want the network to blow up, they should  put all the chicks in G-strings.  Nice.  Definitely.  Anything else, Dennis?  No, it's not.  Okay.  Everyone wants to talk to you guys.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's going on with that target in Hardy's back, man?  Bunky's back?  Bunky's back.  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe they should have put that target lower. 
[00:37:00]  I don't really know.  It wasn't my thing.  Bunky was...  Oh, man, great job, though, Will.  Thanks a lot, man.  Really fun watching, man.  Appreciate it.  Bunky had hair everywhere except on his head, and he would shave it into a bullseye.  Yeah, he wrote Big Brother, too, on his back.  On his back?  Well, he was just that furry.  He looked like a silverback.  He was really hairy.  He was really hairy.  Silverback gorilla.  Silverback gorilla.  Yeah, he did.  He really was that hairy, though.  It was weird.  I mean, gorilla's in the mist.  Nothing on him.  Yeah.  Hey, dude, it was funny how you blew off your brother to hug Shannon, by the way. 
[00:37:30]  Your brother flies out there.  No, he lives out there, so he doesn't care.  Oh, okay.  He's out of it.  Me and my girlfriend are laughing.  He was high, I think.  It was hilarious.  They get out of the house, and there's Will's brother, you know, to greet him.  He's been in the house, what, three months, whatever it is?  He's like, hey, dude, runs right by him to continue on his shatting.  That's true.  Listen, what was I supposed to do?  I don't play with you, but it was funny.  There's no question about Will's sex, y'all.  Laura, what's up?  Hey, Will.  Hey.  You schemed everybody so bad.  That's true.  I hated you.  Sorry.  When you first got on. 
[00:38:00]  You know what?  You played the game better than anybody else did.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  And I would have had to vote for you.  Oh, thank you.  Even though I hated you.  Okay.  Well.  I hated you.  Get a grip on yourself.  No, really.  You definitely deserve to win.  Cool.  He wouldn't win anything.  I knew what you were doing from the beginning.  I'm like, I can't believe no one else is picking up on this.  He was kind of flying under the radar.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe that anyone would fall for anything that you had to say.  Yeah, I couldn't believe it either, actually. 
[00:38:30]  Good thing I wasn't there.  Nicole is such a sap.  Yeah.  Over and over again.  She's a sucker.  Well, just to go, I mean, they didn't take too many IQ tests in the house before we all  went on.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Could you smoke in the house?  I didn't see it.  No, outside of the code.  See, that was the problem.  There's so many people smoked.  I'm addicted to secondhand smoke now.  Like, I have to be around smokers so I can, like, I have to go to bars and, like, sit  in them so I can get some smoke.  What about the cash?  You got a half a mil?  Yeah.  Any plans for that?  Yeah.  You know what?  I've been getting a lot of flack about it. 
[00:39:00]  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it.  Dude, I know what you're doing.  No.  Just do what you...  It was funny because they asked if you were going to give any money to charity and he  was honest.  He said, no.  I'm going to spend it on my friends and stuff.  It's not going over so well.  Don't let these idiots get to you.  Oh, because you said that now.  People are like, hey, you know...  You know, I didn't understand the context of what was going on exactly.  And you know what else?  This sounds bad, but people...  They didn't say that this specific tragedy, excuse me.  They said, in general, are you going to give any money to charity?  And he said, no, I'm going to...  Oh, ow. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, it was a bad call.  But you know what else, too?  People...  Bunky asked the question.  And people are really...  What he really was saying is like, hey, listen, I'm gay Bunky.  I give money.  You know, look how nice I am.  And people are really quick to give away other people's money.  You know, my question to him is, what are you doing?  You know, quit bugging me.  Go get a job or something.  Wow.  Gay Bunky.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bunky was interesting to say the least.  Go get a job.  Let's go to Robert.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, Will, how are you doing?  Yo, man.  What's up, Robert?  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Is it true that you guys, you and Nicole, were getting it on or fooling around a bit? 
[00:40:00]  No.  You know what?  I needed a vote that day, so I...  Yeah, I let her...  No, no, just kidding.  I wish it was more interesting than it was, but it's just not.  There's not much of the story there.  I think CBS tried to play that up a little bit.  Nicole was very flirtatious, and it's like I said to her from the beginning.  I'm like, listen, I'm going to try to make this show very scandalous, and if you're married,  this might not be a show you want to be on.  And she's like...  She said, you know, she'll make that judgment for herself, so...  Hey, how old is her husband?  I don't know, like 40, but he aged like 40 years.  Oh, you can only see that he's all gray, and it looked like he was really old. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I don't think...  He never really showed his face, but he...  I don't know.  Do you think you'll keep in touch with Nicole?  I'm sure he's got an ulcer, so...  Huh?  Go ahead, Robert.  Do you think you'll keep in touch with Nicole, or do you just totally dislike her?  No, I really dislike Nicole.  I mean, I think, in general, she's an okay person.  She's just someone I never want to live with.  Like, you know, if she was an employee or something, or like, you know, a co-worker  or something, you could maybe survive in an environment with her, but you just couldn't  live with her.  All right.  Well, best of luck to you, man.  Thanks a lot, man.  I hope to see you on TV.  All right.  I appreciate that.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Any of you guys hanging out? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, we hang out with Mike Boogie.  I mean, I know you two are, obviously, but anyone else?  We're on really good terms with Mike Boogie, and Monica's cool as hell.  You like Krista?  Krista's interesting.  She's a lot of fun.  I mean, she's a little much at times, but she's really cool.  She don't belong in your group, man.  Well, she tried to be Chiltown at the end, and it was kind of funny because she voted  for Nicole.  Wasn't that right?  In the very first week?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She voted to keep Nicole.  Right.  Let's go to Fran.  Hey, Fran.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Will, I want you to be as brutally honest as you have been all along. 
[00:41:30]  Did Hardy throw off as much, like, homosexual tendencies as it came across on TV?  You know what?  I have really bad gaydar.  Like, I'm just not very perceptive of that.  I didn't even realize Bunky was gay at first.  I just sort of...  Sweet.  No, I swear.  I'm just sort of oblivious, but people...  Gaydar's off, then.  Yeah.  People told me that he was getting some pretty...  Next reviews?  He's going on vacation to Fire Island, if you know what I mean.  You know what?  Seriously, though, Hardy's actually one of the people in the house who I really like.  He's a really nice guy.  He just kind of, you know, associated himself... 
[00:42:00]  I can't say the same.  Well, he associated himself with Nicole, and he's kind of just got in this downward spiral,  and he's very insecure, but he's actually a really nice guy.  It just seems that he's just throwing all this, like, I can't...  To me, he was more flaming than Bunky at times.  Yeah, I mean, one could argue that.  I could agree with that.  Yeah, he's dying his hair.  Really?  He's dying his hair, and just the way he would talk, and some of the things he did with Bunky.  Yeah, they were pretty close at times.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Dave has something. 
[00:42:30]  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I got two questions.  I didn't watch this show.  I thought no one watched this show.  Everyone's calling in like crazy here.  Heck no.  Go ahead, Dave.  My first question is, how hot is this chick?  She sounds intense.  Shannon?  Shannon?  Yeah.  She's hot.  She's unbelievable.  And second question, are you going to take a picture and put her on the site?  Yeah, we should.  Yeah, that would be a great idea.  That's where I can check her out.  Of course.  Thanks, guys.  You could just go to Will's website.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Go ahead.  It's not my website.  Let me tell you, there's some hot pictures.  Shannon, what is it?  Just, yeah, fans make crazy websites, and there's some fans that worship Shannon.  Just go to willkirby.net, and you can pull up all the pictures of Will and Shannon in  the house, and also it links to my website, so you can pick up on it.  What's your website?  ShannonMichelle.com.  These aren't even our websites.  You got the teaback pictures?  Those are all in the house on the willkirby.net.  Definitely.  They're all there.  Go on the Will and Shannon pictures and Shannon pictures. 
[00:43:30]  These aren't even our sites.  These are just some cool fan sites.  Danielle.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, what's up?  I'm a big fan, and I just had a question for Will, and I want his honesty, and I know  Banner went over stating about Will planning to fake cancer for the money.  What was that about?  You know, one time I was considering a lot of different ideas at one point, and some  hit, and some missed, and that was one that missed. 
[00:44:00]  But needless to say, I don't have cancer.  You were going to say that at the end?  I don't know.  Well, I'm not even going to get into that, but I don't have cancer.  Let's just put it that way.  And I also did not throw a goofy in the river at Disney World, no matter what anybody says.  I swear I didn't do that.  All right.  Let's go to Eric.  Not that I wouldn't.  Eric, you're next on the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  We're hanging with the gang from Big Brother 2.  Shannon and Will.  Will, what's the deal with getting your hair all made up and wetting your fingers and  rubbing your nipples?  What's the deal with that?  Rubbing my nipples?  All the rest is true, but I don't remember rubbing my nipples. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, man.  When you were looking at a mirror in the bathroom at one time.  This might be a wet dream of yours.  I don't really know if I'm doing it.  No, I don't think so.  I'll tell you what.  Whatever fantasy you want is fine with me.  I got another question for you.  You make me whatever you want into, baby.  You are so pompous, though.  I have to say I love it.  Every time he passes the mirror, he's checking his hair and stuff.  I got another question for you.  I've always been at one of my dreams with Bunky, and he had the newspapers, and all he did  was check himself out in the mirror.  Hey, Will.  Go ahead, Eric.  You said you liked Monica.  I found her to be pompous and homegirl-like.  Hello.  Yeah, in a lot of ways, she was like that, but the thing is... 
[00:45:00]  She was a babbling idiot.  Okay, that might be true, but she would give her speeches.  What are you trying to say?  It's on.  It's on.  It's on.  What's on?  In certain settings, your friend becomes a friend of your enemy.  Does that make any sense?  She kind of hated Nicole, so I kind of liked her.  Anyone who hated Nicole became a friend of mine.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Sorry.  That's a good answer, I guess.  I don't care.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, Will.  Yo, man.  Yeah, good job on the show.  Thanks a lot.  Can you write me a prescription for Vicodin? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, no problem.  It's on its way.  All right, bro.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Hey, Dave, what's up?  This is Perky Dave.  How you doing, Will?  Yo, what's up?  You know, I never watch a show, but your friend Evan down in Atlanta?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, he's really good friends with my girlfriend and sister, and I started watching.  You were just like the guy's guy.  Cool, man.  Thanks a lot.  It's like a fun watch, and you just manipulate all those women.  I appreciate that.  I guess.  That's it?  That's it?  You didn't watch, but it's anyway. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Jen from Boston wants in.  Jen, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Jen.  I just wanted to say, Will's a hottie.  Oh, thank you.  But he is evil, and Shannon's a skank hoe, and they deserve each other.  Oh.  That's right, baby.  I love it.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Take care.  Yeah, you didn't come across nicely on TV.  Of course not.  Just sitting here with you, you seem like a pretty cool person.  I'm not bad.  My girlfriend hated you, and didn't like Will that much either.  Well, you know, they had a void, and they needed to fill it, so they said, Shannon, 
[00:46:30]  you know what Autumn said about you?  And so they just fueled a fire.  She took a hearty's toothbrush and cleaned out the toilet bowl.  Oh, really?  And then CBS scolds them.  Yeah.  And they laughed in the background.  It was hilarious.  You can hold the knife to someone's neck, and they kick you out, but cleaning the toilet,  that's cool.  Makes for good television.  Yeah, it definitely makes for good television.  If anybody laughed, do not call up and scold me for doing it.  Oh, good.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Amy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I love ONA, first of all. 
[00:47:00]  All right, girl.  Thanks, Amy.  Will and Shannon, you guys rock.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, who's better than you?  Shannon, the toothbrush.  It was the best thing I've ever seen.  Hey, glad to make you happy, Mom.  Oh, my God.  Me and my roommate were wasted, first of all.  We were killing ourselves.  We had it taped for somebody else, and we just kept watching it over and over.  And, Will, you won me $1,000 winning, buddy.  All right.  I bet on you from the beginning.  I'll take my usual 20%, please.  You are the boss.  All right, Amy.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:47:30]  You know what's funny?  She said she was watching it wasted.  A lot of people told me they really liked the show high or drunk.  Really?  Yeah, they didn't like it normal.  Seriously?  But other than that, they loved it.  The best way to watch is on the internet, though, because before they cut it all up.  Exactly.  It's pretty raw.  Yeah, definitely.  Anyone whacking it in the house?  I'm asking.  Yeah, Bunky was spanking it.  Bunky was spanking it?  He was flogging the dolphin a lot.  And he told you guys?  Well, the room he was in, yes, was like, please stop calling it that.  Party walked in on him one night.  Yeah.  He was roughing up the suspect a little too often. 
[00:48:00]  No one else?  Shannon, no?  No, I don't know of anybody else.  Just Bunky.  Just Bunky.  That's not what I was going for.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Tom.  Yeah, I just checked out the pics on the website.  Shannon's a hottie.  And I'm thinking Playboy.  Shannon, comment?  Playboy called, and it's a no-go.  Why?  What?  Will and I talked about it, and it's a no-go right now.  Oh, Will.  Don't be a pussy.  You're a renee.  Later, guys.  What are you doing? 
[00:48:30]  We don't need the money that bad yet, but take care of us.  Think of others.  Now, saying that you guys talked about it, does that mean you would be okay with it, but  Will had a little bit of an issue?  It all depended.  I mean, obviously, the right amount of money would be definitely in there, because, you  know, Jerry just had her issue come out, and I think it was pretty popular.  And I have no doubt that mine would be popular, but you never know.  I mean, everybody has a different opinion about me, but Will and I, it's just not in 
[00:49:00]  the future right now.  It's kind of like an ending point, you know?  What, is Autumn going to be in one of these, Matt?  Ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's just...  Who are they going to get, then?  When you run out of money, then you...  Oh, come on now.  Nicole has a big 70s bush, I heard.  The big 70s Earth Mama Moth.  Yeah, that's what we call it, the 70s Earth Mama Moth.  Nice.  All right.  What's wrong?  You all right with this?  It's all right.  We've got to get them out of here.  They've got a flight to catch.  All right.  It's crazy to fly.  You know what?  How's that work, man, for you guys? 
[00:49:30]  No, it's a safe time to fly, man.  There's police everywhere.  I mean, they're all over stuff.  Hollywood calling you guys?  Is there anything going on yet?  We're getting lots of good tips.  Lots of people are interested.  Are you really a doctor?  Yeah.  I thought that might have been a scam to me.  Yeah, we need to demolish all those other rumors.  Yes, he really is a doctor.  No, yeah, Hollywood's calling.  There's a lot of good stuff going on.  People are interested.  So we sort of, I think we brought some young demographics to CBS, and they're happy about  that.  Cool.  All right.  Well, next time you're in New York, stop by.  Please.  Get really crazy next time.  Definitely.  It's Will and Shannon from Big Brother 2. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  And we'll be back with Angry Young Earl.  Oh, you guys got to stick around for the song.  It's great.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't stumble.  We can't let these people reproduce.  Obviously, no class.  In the toilet.  They'll never work in the town again.  Disgusting.  How do they let this on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Childish.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, stacker to the world's strongest fat burner.

[00:51:30]  1027 WNEW, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers for you.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  Write that down.  You're going to need it.  866-2774.  Wow.  In the studio, Jim Norton.  Wow. 
[00:52:00]  On the way, the real Greg Brady, Barry Williams.  He does some great radio for us.  Can't wait to see him.  We need the Brady reaction.  Also, Anthony, the penis puppeteer is coming in today.  What?  You know something?  Rick told me that about five minutes ago.  I don't think we could get any gayer than the penis puppeteers.  Are they from England, those guys?  I remember hearing about a group like that.  Who cares where they're from, Jim?  You're right.  You know what we're checking out today? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, they make puppets and stuff with their mules.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're at the Montreal Conference.  And we're going to be sitting here watching this.  Wait, wait, wait.  Do they put puppets on them?  No.  I don't know.  Get Rick.  I think they just like...  Now, let me also say something.  Rick booked this?  Yeah.  Okay.  Remember when we did a segment on the radio, I don't know, three or four months ago, where  people called in with their penis tricks?  Right.  Exactly.  I think that's what we're going to be seeing live.  Penis tricks.  One of my favorites was... 
[00:53:00]  Like the birdbath.  The birdbath, yeah.  Actually, I like the way you pull just a little piece of scrote through the top of your zipper.  Zip it up.  But be very careful there.  So, a little bit sticking out, and then you're in a bar or something like that, and you ask  a girl, you go, how do you get gum off your pants?  I got some gum on my pants.  And then they'll, you know, scrape at it and touch it.  And get some gum off of your pants, thinking that your disgusting scrote sticking out of 
[00:53:30]  the top of your zipper is a piece of gum.  Yeah.  What girl would actually scrape at it, though?  I don't know.  You know, maybe a girl you know, but don't really know that well, you know, kind of thing.  Jim, I've seen you do some things in bars, so just don't even question it.  No, you're right, and that is what you want on your scrotum, a nail scratching.  Yeah.  At least they only take a little piece out.  I've seen Jim at a bar, just hanging out, like this.  Just hanging at the bar like this.  It's called hanging the brain, when you put the whole thing out there.  Just hanging at the bar, talking to chicks with his whole mule out of his pants, wondering 
[00:54:00]  when they're going to notice.  It's one of the funniest tricks you do.  And it's a fine mule, I might add.  I love the, I love the, I love the, you drop something game that you do, but you at the  bar with your mule out is beyond funny.  Thank you.  And you don't even drink.  You don't even drink, and you do stuff like that.  I can only imagine what it was like when it was drinking.  Hey, uh, well, look at his...  Long sleeves in August. 
[00:54:30]  Long sleeves in August.  Yeah, that lamp.  Very nice.  Where's Rick?  He's outside the studio.  We've got to talk about the, uh...  The penis puppeteer.  Penis puppeteers.  He's been trying to get Earl down here, and Earl is refusing, so I think last time he  was trying to physically get him down.  What is Earl's problem?  We...  We worked on a song, mostly Rick, for many hours, and we want Earl to hear it.  On the way, the Angry Young Earl song.  He's kind of, um...  Within minutes, before we take a break, we will definitely play it.  He's still trying to get Earl to come down here. 
[00:55:00]  All right, so where's Rick?  We need to talk to him now.  We've got to talk to Rick either way about the penis puppeteers.  Yeah, I hear Rick says, he goes, yeah, uh, Greg Brady should be coming in later on, and  then we got the penis puppeteers.  I'm like, what?  And he goes, penis puppeteers?  I talked to you guys about this a while ago.  I'm like, wait, wait, what?  And then we talked about...  We also talk about things like glory holes and stuff like that.  It's not like we want to see them and have them happen here in our studio.  Why are they...  Uh-oh. 
[00:55:30]  You know, why are they forcing Earl in here?  All right.  Because he won't come by himself.  Earl?  All right, Earl.  What's wrong, Earl?  What's the matter, Earl?  Earl, what's the problem?  Didn't we all have fun at the Black Crow Saturday night?  No.  You're sick.  You're sick?  I'm still sick.  Smallpox?  Anthrax?  What do you got?  What do you got?  You haven't been under any crop dusters, yeah.  Crop dusters go over your place and foresters?  Nothing like that?  You all right?  You okay, Earl?  You got the AIDS?  What do you got?  The AIDS? 
[00:56:00]  What do we got, Earl?  Earl.  What are we working on?  Earl, is this...  You got the croup?  Is this a defensive mechanism you got going on?  We haven't even abused you.  You got the sunglasses on.  You got the pout going.  We haven't even said anything.  I just don't want to do anything.  We're pretty excited because we worked on a song, mostly Rick.  Come on.  Yank's magic number's what, two?  Yeah, look.  I'm going to be happy about that.  Look, your team's going to clinch again.  Come on.  Goddamn Mets.  Goddamn Benitez.  Benitez is the biggest waste of space, and that's quite a bit of space, on the Mets. 
[00:56:30]  Stop pitching Benitez in these important situations.  Absolutely.  Don't even...  I don't understand it.  I'm not a Mets fan.  Mets can make a miracle comeback.  They should have won yesterday.  We would have been right in it.  When Piazza slammed that home run in the last game, that was the magic that the Mets always  talk about.  Although, if you have to have the Brewers closed out in June, Benitez is your man.  Benitez stinks.  The guy stinks on ice. 
[00:57:00]  Just in big situations.  He's a good closer, but in big situations, he chokes.  He chokes awful.  The only time he actually gets out of it, and why he has any saves, is because they could  be behind, or they could be ahead, but he will make it so they're only like one run ahead  from like five.  They could be five runs up.  They put in Benitez, and they win with one run.  As soon as they brought him in, I'm like...  He stinks.  As soon as they brought him in, I'm like, it's over.  It stinks.  It's over. 
[00:57:30]  Awful.  Jets won, though.  Patriots look real good this year, Ben.  Go Pats!  Anyway, Rick, what is the penis puppet here?  Rick, what's going on here now?  Oh, those are the guys that...  Will they be doing penis tricks, or will they have cute little puppets on their mules?  How does this work?  I don't know anything about the penis puppeteer.  Are they going to have music and stuff?  Are they going to put on a whole little show?  I don't know if they've got music, but I know that it's like...  I guess it's a comedy bit they do with their schlongs, and they wrap them up and tie them 
[00:58:00]  and make them look like certain things.  They make their...  So we will have to really stare very long at man's junk, and you book this.  Because it can't be a glance...  Like, remember that guy that had that thing on his sack?  The plague.  Wasn't it the plague?  Did we see the plague's joke?  No, I think that was a big, big heavy guy.  Oh, what?  No, no, no.  There was some guy who had that big thing on the side of his sack.  The dude from Ron and Fez, the really big guy? 
[00:58:30]  No, he had the...  That had no...  He had no junk.  He had no junk.  He just had the...  Remember the plague had a big abscess on the side of his sack?  I don't remember.  The plague.  Was it the plague?  I really don't remember.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Thank you.  And we all had to take a quick look.  And it was like, everyone kind of looked like, like, boom, real quick.  Like, like, look for two seconds.  Look away.  This is something that can't be done like this.  We're going to have to look and go, wow, look.  His junk looks like Nixon. 
[00:59:00]  What about the time we had to see the guy with the 16-inch schween?  Yeah, that guy.  That's worth it.  He said he had a 16-inch schlong, and he keeps pulling it.  The guy pulled and tugged on this thing all the time.  It was hilarious because he came in with spandex, and I swear to you, it looked like a belt.  He had tight spandex.  It was all the way down to his knee.  That's what he should wear.  We had all the girls in the building come down, and it was hilarious.  It was a bit of a trick, what he was doing.  He did have a very large mule, but it was not as long as he said it was. 
[00:59:30]  What he did, he would pull it down and, like, stick it to the side of his leg, kind of.  There was a little trick to it.  How many guys could stick it to the side of your leg?  Absolutely not many.  All right.  I'm just saying.  Now, back to this.  Rick, so you booked a part of the show where all of us are going to have to stare at man's junk.  Yes.  Opie approved, yeah.  Oh, don't pull.  Look at how he tries.  Look at how he tries, Opie.  I showed you the influence. 
[01:00:00]  The guy who tries, Opie, look at these guys.  Dude, you approved it.  Rick always tries to do this.  Don't pass the buck.  You're in the back.  I'm not passing the buck.  They gave me paperwork.  I said, do you want to book these guys?  Where did you hear about this?  Some publicist.  First inkling.  A publicist calls you.  Yeah.  Says, I got these guys.  They pull their mule out in front of you and play with it.  And you go, book them.  And you actually approach Opie with this.  I have no problem with it because of the uncomfortableness that everyone has. 
[01:00:30]  No one's going to feel in this studio.  They sent over some paperwork.  All right.  I'm like, huh.  Let me show.  Let me show.  Yeah.  Oh, and they sent pictures.  And I showed it to him.  It was this, like, 10-page thing.  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Book them.  I'm like, huh?  Book the man.  Oh, no.  They wear capes?  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, this is Matt from over at Altru.  Rick, I'm calling to bail you out, man.  I've actually seen the show.  Wait, hold on.  We're distracted because we found the Penis Puppeteers website. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, I've actually seen that show.  You have.  And for the first two minutes, you're going to be kind of cringing.  But after a while, you get used to it.  They're really funny guys.  They party a lot.  They're cool guys.  Some up in Montreal this summer.  Do we have any chicks around to take some of the gayness out of this segment that's about to happen?  We got it.  Relax.  It's going to be okay.  We got Rachel and Mary.  It's going to be okay.  All right.  Maybe some other girls in the building would like to come down.  There has to be more girls in the studio than guys, or we're not doing the same.  I don't know.  I mean, they had a bit where they pulled a girl out of the audience and did a couple fan participation numbers. 
[01:01:30]  So maybe you can pick on somebody that way.  I don't know.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Any ladies in the building, we know we have some people that like the show in the building.  If you want to see the Penis Puppeteers, make your way down to the 10th floor.  Yeah, that might be better.  Because then I won't feel as gay.  Mary's digging it.  Mary's going to dig it.  All right.  Can't wait for the Penis Puppeteers.  And Barry Williams.  We got to do it when Barry Williams does it.  Cabaret show.  See, that'll help, too.  You get Barry in here.  Barry Williams. 
[01:02:00]  Because having Greg Brady while you look at penises does make it less gay.  Good point.  All right.  Let's get back to Earl.  Hi, Earl.  We came up with a little song for you.  Earl?  Why are you giving the international sign a big whoop?  What am I going to do about it?  We're proud.  Rick worked on it, like, for four hours today, Earl. 
[01:02:30]  You want to just play it?  Jesus Christ.  Is he going to lose his mind?  Well, they make the Eiffel Tower.  One guy makes what he likes to call the Eiffel Tower.  You know what?  That's funny.  I'm sorry.  The Eiffel Tower, Opie.  What he does is he takes the...  Let's just put it this way.  I would not be able to do the Eiffel Tower.  Well, it looks like he takes the part that is usually cut off when you're circumcised  and stretches it, pulls it sideways and out. 
[01:03:00]  Then what's in his fingers, what he's holding, is the base of the Eiffel Tower.  And the rest of his junk makes the tower.  Should we give out that website?  It looks like a big, hairy thing at the top of the Eiffel Tower.  Jesus.  We're going to have to sit and watch this?  And after enough tugging on that part, you know it's going to start to smell like feet.  Awful!  Wow.  Want to give out that website? 
[01:03:30]  Girl.  Steve will link it, because it looks like it's a long website.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  That's a website you guys really, really need.  It's puppetry of the penis.  We put everything on foundrymusic, because a lot of people email and asking for that website  you gave out, I think, Friday, the public execution crap from Afghanistan.  That link is up on foundrymusic.com.  That's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com. 
[01:04:00]  All right?  Can we play the Angry Young Earl song, please?  It's ready.  All right.  Earl, do you want to put your headphones on so you can hear the song?  You're going to love this, Earl.  Tribute.  A lot of people know by now that Earl has a short fuse.  Very, very short temper on Earl.  So we decided to come up with a little ditty.  Rick worked very hard on this, Earl.  We've had a couple of instances. 
[01:04:30]  I hope you're appreciative.  A couple of instances on the show here where Earl might have lost his temper.  Gotten a little mad.  Maybe we were on the phone with him at a sticker stop.  You know, recent events with the beer of having...  We had kegs of beer that we wanted to deliver to the emergency workers down at the World Trade Center.  And Earl couldn't deliver the beer.  Psycho Mark did it in two seconds.  Earl couldn't do it.  He went down there two attempts and failed.  And he got a little angry at the criticism he was taking for that.  Jeff. 
[01:05:00]  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Will I be able to find this song on Prep Burger later?  Oh!  Prep Burger.  It might make Prep Burger.  Excellent.  All right, Jeff.  Good reference.  Howdy, faggot.  All right.  Reference of the day right there.  I think we've wasted enough time, Anthony.  Yeah.  Here we go.  It's Angry Young Earl.  Why don't we get Black Earl in here and see why he's so upset?  I think we all know, but it's always fun when he tries to explain himself.  He's got some rage.  T-minus ten seconds before Earl loses the Epipod. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, here comes Earl.  Earl, don't.  Earl.  Mark.  Go.  F*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  What the hell is that?  Go.  F*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  Come and get it.  Does the three letters FBI mean anything to you?  We'll let Trump go broiled meat, you people, eh?  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  What's the problem? 
[01:06:00]  Ask Earl, what's the problem?  What's the problem, Earl?  Why are you angry?  Well, I'm a little irritated, that's all.  So when I get irritated, I leave the situation.  Why did he slam the door?  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  I don't know.  Does Earl realize how gay he sounds right now?  Right.  Kiss my ass.  Did the invisible man follow you out, Earl?  And he is.  That's what his problem is.  He gives me nothing to go with and then yells at me for not knowing.  Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it. 
[01:06:30]  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  No violence in this office.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  You calling me mental?  You, you, you calling me mental?  And where are the white women at?  Earl, my man.  Guess what?  No one cares.  I'm famous even though I'm not.  Who the F are you?  Gin, soap, cocaine-filled brain.  We're trying to, first of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things. 
[01:07:00]  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to make down there.  We had no business being down there.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot and I'm stupid.  The place in the world for the angry young man  With his working class ties and his radical plans  He refuses to beg, he refuses to call  And he's always at home with his back to the wall  And he's proud of the scars and the battles he's fought  And he struggles and leads as he hangs on his cross  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  Those laminates, it's like the Pope. 
[01:07:30]  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminates?  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminates.  Earl, comment.  Yes.  A moment or two to the angry young man  With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his head  He was stabbing the back, even misunderstood  It's a comfort to know his intentions are good  And he sits in a room with a lock on the door  With his knocks and his family laid out on the floor  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  Well, the mic was drooping down  It would have slammed down on the board. 
[01:08:00]  That's why I was holding the microphone.  That's the age  Consciousness and righteous rage  I found that just surviving  Was a noble fight  You ass  I once believed in causes too  Had my pointless point of view  And life went on no matter who was wrong or right  Guess what?  No one cares.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer  There's always a place for the angry young man  With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  And he's never been able to learn from mistakes 
[01:08:30]  So he can't understand why his heart always breaks  And his honor is pure and his courage is wealth  And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell  And I'll go to the grave as an angry old man  It's a figure of speech.  What about the figure of speech?  Use that mask between your ears called your brain every once in a while  You would know what that means.  You don't get it.  It's a federal disaster area.  This, this, this is, this is an old  Whoa, Earl, calm down!  Earl, comment  I'm the federal service director  Earl, Earl 
[01:09:00]  Earl, Earl  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  They don't give a rat's ass about beer  You  This is an old  Hey, how could, how could a guy with no motion be in promotion?  I don't know!  I don't know! 
[01:09:30]  I don't know!  I'm the public service director  I'm famous even though I'm not!  Screw this!  Stay away from him, Mark, and I guarantee you someone will get injured  Earl, Earl, any final words?  Who the F are you?  You  Ass  Tell me where I'm going!  Whoa  Earl, calm down!  You calling me mental?  Screw this!  Gin-so-cocaine-filled brain  Screw this!  Ass  Again, something you know nothing about  They don't give a rat's ass about beer  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's  Just say it, I'm an idiot and I'm stupid 
[01:10:00]  Screw this!  Ass  That's why I brought the theater down!  Screw this!  Go f*** yourself, okay?  There he is  Thank you, Earl  Earl, thank you  Thank you  Bye-bye  Bye-bye  We look forward to the next one, Paul  With great anticipation  That's right  No, don't stop it  Wow!  Now that's, you know, in the same vein as all the tribute songs that are out there now  That's my favorite tribute song out there  With the clips and with the real song there 
[01:10:30]  There is an example of how it's supposed to be done  That's how it's done, right there  Earl?  Earl, comment  I don't care what you're doing right now  I saw you smiling  I saw you smiling and you laughed a couple of times  He's trying to cover his mouth with his, like, fist  Yeah, yeah  But I saw you smiling under there, pal  What'd you think, Earl?  Earl?  Comment?  What'd you think?  Earl?  Earl, what'd you think, man?  Rick worked on that song for about six hours  What'd you think? 
[01:11:00]  Earl?  He sort of smiled out, man  Nodding his head slowly, a yes  Earl?  If you're not going to say anything, then leave  But say something  You liked it  He liked it  Yeah  You liked it, Earl?  I think Earl liked it  Nod your head if you liked it  It was good  It was fun  Right?  Did he like it, Earl?  He's like Mikey, we're all hoping he liked it  He's honored that somebody would take his many instances of being a horse's ass and make a song out of it  Earl, say something 
[01:11:30]  We gotta move on with the show  Yeah  You know, if he wasn't black, this wouldn't be menacing at all  You know  Earl?  Come on, say something  Anything, Earl?  Any comment at all on what you just heard?  The angry young man for Earl  All right, great  There it is, Earl  All right, Earl  Let's get Earl out of the studio  Earl, you waiting for the man junk puppets? 
[01:12:00]  No?  No?  All right  Who wants to see the Eiffel Tower?  An Eiffel Tower is something  Isn't it?  No?  Yes?  Earl?  Comment?  Anything?  Ugh  Earl, we're insulted  Find out if they can make a Yankee Stadium with their junk  Maybe that'll make Earl feel better  Anything?  No?  It's not easy to get Rick to work six hours on anything  Oh my God  I think that's a record  You're hurting the feelings  Earl?  Anything, Earl 
[01:12:30]  Believe it or not, people  Earl is actually standing right in front of a mic right now  It's not like we're just talking to nobody  Earl is standing in front of a microphone  Headphones on  Are you trying to be  Are you trying out to be Roger Daltrey and Tommy?  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  Earl, can you hear me?  Can you feel me near you?  Just say you liked it because you know you did and then go back to work  And we know you did  Earl? 
[01:13:00]  Ugh  No  Alright, we'll try harder next time I guess  John, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on ONA?  Hey  I was wondering if I could hear the interview of the retarded Laverne and Scherty at the VMA  When they were interviewing all the celebrities as they were going in, yeah?  Yeah, but I want to hear the Brian McFagan one  The one where they call him a tool  You tool  You tool  Everyone knows Brian McFadden from MTV  Yeah  He used to be a little sidekick on a radio show here in New York 
[01:13:30]  He was called Alter Boy  And he wasn't allowed to talk much on that show  No  And they kept his microphone down really low in the background  Way in the back  Let me do a quick imitation of Alter Boy, Brian McFadden  When he used to be on Kane's show over on K-Rock  Alright  Ha ha, yeah Kane  Ha ha, yeah  Yeah Kane, yeah  Ha ha, yeah  That's exactly how it was  Now of course it's 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, awesome  Yeah, it's a little different  But, uh, yeah  So now he's with MTV  Earl, before we play this  Because we're going to take a break  Nothing  Earl, now you've had time to reflect on the song  Anything?  Nothing  Earl, come on  What are you going for here?  Yeah  I don't understand what you're really going for here  Alright  Is it the intimidation?  No, Earl's not like that  Earl's not a violent guy  Alright

Good, how you been?  Hey, you're a tool  That's my radio days  That's awesome  Hey, you're a tool  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah  Michael Jackson  It's Kane doing, huh?

[01:16:30]  107. WNEW.  Mike, what's going on?  Not too much.  All right, you're on the radio, Mike.  Oh, I am? Oh, I was just listening.  I'm a new listener, by the way, and y'all got a great show.  I'm down here in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Yeah, Shannon and Will was on earlier,  and I didn't have a pen handy to write down their website,  so I want to check her out, too.  Yeah, we had Will and Shannon from Big Brother, too, in studio. 
[01:17:00]  WillKirby.com.  How do you spell that?  Kirby, man.  Kirby.  I did it.  K-I-R-B-Y.  I did it wrong.  Oh, it's WillKirby.net.  Dot net.  Kirby, K-I-R-B-Y.  Oh, see, you know, who wouldn't spell it with a U?  I spelled it with K-U-R-B-Y.  And ShannonMichelle.com.  What we'll do is we'll put these websites on our underground website,  FoundryMusic.com.  That's the easiest way. 
[01:17:30]  If we talk about websites or anything else,  you know, just go to FoundryMusic.com,  and it'll be linked for you, okay?  Okay, that's cool.  And that website is F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com, FoundryMusic.com.  All right?  All right, host, thanks a lot.  Great show, Phil.  Thanks.  Also on the underground website is a peak of Britney Spears' boobs  when she was tanning in Australia.  Oh, yeah?  Where's that?  On Foundry.  Oh, good.  But it's just a...  All right, you take care of the rest of the show.  No, and it's just a peak, though.  I don't care. 
[01:18:00]  It's just a peak.  She's on her belly, and she lifts up a little bit  because she's topless, and you get this...  I know those.  I've seen them before.  You get to see a nice shot of the meat.  Yeah?  The breast meat.  It is kind of sexy.  Some meatage?  You switched mics on me, Norton.  No one heard what you just said.  Oh, it's okay.  Damn.  Now it's going to be all, like, busy in traffic and whatnot.  Big news with Britney Spears.  They pay her millions of dollars to promote Pepsi,  and she was caught drinking a Coke in Australia.  Where would the Britney thing be? 
[01:18:30]  Under files or something.  Under what?  It's Foundry Music, so it's nearly impossible to navigate.  Very hard.  It'll be right up there.  Where?  Go down.  Go down.  All right, right in the...  Penis Puppeteer, Community Section, Steve Speaks, Audio Clips,  Wow Caught on Tape.  Britney Spears.  Britney's boobs.  Right.  I'm almost in photo and VidCamp.  All right, there you go.  You're almost there.  All right.  Now it's going to take you even longer, because more people... 
[01:19:00]  If you want to play along, it's foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Now it's too late.  Too late?  Yeah, because I'm never going to see it now.  Your sons of bitches?  You couldn't let me see it, could you?  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  We're going to get you.  That's up.  If you're not in the New York area and you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW.  Barry Williams is here.  Let him in.  The real Greg Brady's here.  And the penis puppeteers.  I think they're warming up. 
[01:19:30]  They're warming up.  Hey, Barry.  It's Barry.  Barry, Barry.  How you been?  Radio moguls.  Oh, yes.  That's true.  You know, it has been a little while.  I come on the scene of two young, struggling talkmeisters trying to make it in the Big Apple.  Yes.  Simple.  Mostly known for just being bad or getting in trouble.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And now here we are.  Yeah.  Here we are, knocking them out, adding them week by week by week.  That's it.  See?  So, do you think you're going to lose your touch with the common man? 
[01:20:00]  We've lost it a long time ago, Barry.  It's not an issue.  We could care less about the common man.  I know exactly how it's going to happen.  You're going to start cashing those paychecks.  Yeah.  And then you're going to go out, and the first thing is going to be, oh, you know what?  I think I feel like a new style of hair.  Is that it?  And then it's going to be a manicure, and then it's the facial.  Then you've got to start with the clothes.  Barry, look at us.  Not yet.  I'm saying I'm proud of you guys.  I am proud.  I got ripped jeans.  I'm just telling you what to expect.  I got my same T-shirts. 
[01:20:30]  As someone who's been through it, and this is how I know.  And then what?  You start buying the cars.  The cars.  The nice stuff.  Then you have things made for you, and when you put your initials on.  Like the Johnny Bravo vest?  Forget it.  Exactly.  If you do it, J.B.  J.B.  Johnny Bravo.  Forget it.  All together.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Bravo.  Wow.  Look at that.  Barry's going to be on the weakest link, what, tonight or tomorrow?  The weakest link tonight.  Oh, really?  Now, is this a gas?  So they've taped it already.  Yeah, guess who they put you should.  Who won? 
[01:21:00]  Who won?  You should.  Yeah, good.  Good, O.B.  I'm glad you asked, because that was the next thing I was going to say.  You should have come out, Ant.  Because they were all together.  The Marsh.  All of you.  The Marsh, the Jan, the Susan, who's turned into quite a buxom and fun-loving young lady.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Little Cindy looks hot now?  I don't know.  She's hot, then she got, and now she's hot again.  She did the kid thing, and she hasn't fully recovered.  But she's still got that face, and she's got a great personality. 
[01:21:30]  But, you know, she's not hot, hot, hot.  Does she still have the lisp?  Not hot.  If you ask her really nicely, she'll do that for you.  And what about Mike Brady?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Oh, man.  I know.  Oh, man.  It's a tough room.  Did they leave an empty podium there?  No, we filled it with Cousin Oliver.  No, you didn't.  For real.  No, what the hell is that guy?  What does he look like?  For real.  He looks exactly the same.  Like John Denver?  Miniature John Denver.  He's still wearing glasses, but now he's middle-aged with facial hair and has a paunch. 
[01:22:00]  He's very funny, though.  Does he still have the Oliver haircut?  Oh, totally.  Did you all beat him silly for ruining the show?  Of course.  You did?  And by the way, you know, he's a musician.  Yeah.  And he was doing radio interviews for a little while, and he's giving them up, because that's  all anybody will ask him about.  You ruined our show.  You ruined the Brady Bunch.  You ruined our show.  I love the Brady Bunch.  You get the two-sand the guy wrecked it.  Jump, jump, jump the shark.  Right.  Exactly.  That was his thing.  That's the one.  The Brady's were fine without Cousin Oliver. 
[01:22:30]  You did not need Cousin Oliver.  No.  And bring him in.  All of a sudden, the wacky things, your hair's turning orange, and the show's over.  So, Opie, I cannot tell you who won tonight, because that would be a real giveaway, wouldn't  it?  Yeah.  But I can tell you who was the weakest link.  Uh-oh.  Cousin Oliver.  We've been talking about it.  That was the rubsy.  None of us wanted to...  That's so funny.  He's the first one.  Everyone's just like, get out of here.  Get the hell out of here.  We didn't even need a reason, you know.  That's great.  Go.  We threw you a bone. 
[01:23:00]  Now, get off this show.  He is...  And the thing that was kind of fun with Ann, the host...  No, no, the hostess.  What's her name, Ann?  That bitch.  What?  Yeah.  We call her.  Le Toité.  She didn't, like, grow up with the bunch, you know, so she didn't have the same kind  of affection for the people over here.  So, well...  That was a snotty English attitude, yeah.  So, in some ways, she was kind of always referring to us, in some ways, like we were a family.  So, she turned around and she goes, Florence, I've noticed that you voted against Christopher 
[01:23:30]  Knight, and now there's a vote against Barry Williams.  Do you not get along with your stepchildren?  Oh, brother.  I have a question.  Do you still keep in touch with Mr. Hanalei?  Mr. Hanalei?  Is it Don Ho?  From the Hawaii episode.  Mr. Hanalei.  Is that Don Ho?  Mr. Hanalei.  Oh, no, he's the old man.  He was the old man who had the property, right?  Yeah.  But I did nothing wrong.  And he knew...  I did nothing wrong.  My self-centered son of a bitch. 
[01:24:00]  That's where we found the tiki, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And the thing almost hit you when it fell?  Oh, was that you at almost...  No, he almost got wiped out on the surfboard.  Surfboard.  But the painting fell, almost hit...  Who did that almost...  I think it was Bobby.  Yeah.  Peter or Bobby?  I think Bobby.  I think Peter had the spider.  Peter had the spider.  And Bobby had the spider.  Yeah.  It was a very harrowing three-part episode that you made us wait through.  And didn't the painting fall in someone's lap and almost hit Bobby in the back of the head?  Oh. 
[01:24:30]  So, you know, they did the movie, the second movie, that pitiful excuse for a motion picture,  the very Brady sequel.  Yeah.  But the thing that I was watching this, I was saying, oh, man, he's wearing the tiki.  Yeah.  I've got to get the tiki.  So I went to the studio and I kind of talked my way in.  Look at you.  And I had to go, you know, I'm saying things like, that made me really proud, like, no,  really, man, I used to be, I was, you know, I was on the Brady bus, man.  Oh, I used to work here.  No, I mean, you know, I worked right here. 
[01:25:00]  I used to have my own parking space and stuff.  Anyway, I finally, you know, like, walked my way to...  Tell me about the tiki.  So I got it.  I got it.  And the thing is, the original one was ruined.  It was in, because it was in an earthquake.  They have those in California.  Yeah.  And it was wooden and really cool.  That's what I thought I was going to get.  Like, what did I get?  This is like, it's like a mold of it.  It's spongy and it's all phony.  And so I was like, well, all right.  How did the original get ruined in an earthquake?  Well, because all of the props, you know, the horse and the table, that really, you know, 
[01:25:30]  I mean, we could use that for micro table today.  And the whole kitchen set and the couches and the walls and all that were all stored over  at Paramount and in the prop room.  And then we had that huge earthquake in the early 80s.  And it destroyed it all.  Yeah, just, it was...  Oh, man.  There goes the Brady memorabilia.  I was going to freak out.  I thought he was going to pull out the tiki.  I know.  The tiki.  God could be just so...  He can just be so cruel sometimes.  So cruel.  Yeah.  Well, listen, we got to take a break.  Boy, do we have a surprise for you today, Barry.  Well, I can't.  I mean, it just wouldn't be the same. 
[01:26:00]  Let me tell you.  Yeah.  Every time.  Oh, boy.  It's O&A Day.  You know, today's a coincidence, though.  Yeah.  He has been in the studio for some crazy crap.  And I had taken a whipple ball professionally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've had the whiffle ball bat challenge go on in here, where we have girls come in and  see how much of a whiffle ball bat they can accept, which is now being done in Atlanta.  Yeah, it seems to be a popular bit with the regular guys.  See, I told you.  You guys have made it.  You already copied it, emulated it.  They're loving it now.  There's no stopping you now.  Do they give you credit? 
[01:26:30]  Of course not.  Of course not.  The regular guys?  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  Well, they've been around.  They've stopped on them before.  I guess so.  It's some easy money.  The regular guy look.  Yeah.  There you go.  We're just regular guys.  So, we've had you in during that, and you've seen fine women do that.  We've had strippers in here.  We've had the whipped cream thing going on.  We've had spankings.  We've had, name it, we've done it as Barry Williams has been here.  God, I love you guys.  Yeah.  It's been a little hard to top that, and I want to tell you something. 
[01:27:00]  And Rick is completely responsible for the shenanigans we have going on in here today.  He has a piss eating grin on his face right now.  You can see this.  Oh, me?  I just swallowed a canary.  Let me tell you something.  I don't think this is going to be a day where you're going to be involved in any of the stuff  that goes on like you usually are.  That's okay.  And I don't think you're going to have a problem with that.  Oh, Barry, up next.  You're going to help.  I brought a magazine of pictures to look through in case.  You're going to help us out with the penis puppeteers next.  What?  What?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:27:30]  We figured you had it too easy coming on our show, and we have to bring you back there.  I'm going to look through my magazine now.  You were spoiled, and now it's time to...  You've got to see the hamburgers.  Well, wait a minute.  Now, wait a minute.  Well, wait a minute.  Are these female fingers that do the drumming?  Well, no.  What?  What?  No.  These are guys that come in.  This is wrong.  They pull their junk out, and it's sort of like genital origami, I guess they call it.  And they manipulate certain things, and they can make it look like stuff. 
[01:28:00]  Can you show Barry a picture, maybe, Anthony?  Let me see if I can pop up the hamburger.  As you find that website, once again, I want to tell the ladies that work in this building,  we need your help with this bit.  We need the ladies in the studio.  So come on down to the 10th floor, and we'll let you in the studio to check out the penis  puppeteers.  Yeah.  Because it's going to just be a bunch of guys in...  Yeah, man.  I'm going to start getting fan mail from prisons, man.  This is not good.  They write some good letters, though, Barry.  Yeah.  Very enjoyable. 
[01:28:30]  Would you like to share?  I'll see if I can find it.  Let me go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Watching the commercials for The Weakest Link all weekend.  Yeah.  Marsha's still looking hot.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She looks good, Jay.  Yeah.  And that's on tonight at...  Eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock.  Okay.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, the commercials look great.  Did Eve do it, too?  Thanks, Joe.  They all did it, man.  Really?  They all did it.  Now, Eve usually...  The old Baz gave him a call.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Did Eve go back to blonde, or...  No, no.  She looks very different. 
[01:29:00]  I know, because she doesn't want to look like...  I know.  She looks far away from her...  Yeah.  You know.  She...  She...  I tell you something.  Hawaiian episode, she was starting to look hot.  And I'm like, okay.  It's starting to happen.  She's going to look good.  It's going to happen.  And then, when that Dawn portrait of a teenage run away...  I'm there.  I'm there with you.  I was...  I was like, oh, my God.  Eve come here.  She's about there.  And then, all of a sudden, she disappeared.  And I saw pictures of her.  And I was like, what happened?  She got pissed off, man.  She did not get pissed off.  Cut it all off.  A Brady can't get pissed.  You can't do it. 
[01:29:30]  The looks go.  The looks go.  Yeah.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, Barry.  Quick question.  Big Brady fan.  Grew up on the Bradys.  Relate every life experience to the Bradys.  However, I need to know, what the hell was that thing on your lip during the UFO episode?  The most asked question ever.  I know.  Everyone knows it was herpes.  Yeah.  No.  Barry has said it on our show.  No.  Ron?  No.  I don't know.  I must have missed it.  He got in a car accident on his way to the show.  Right.  To film the show. 
[01:30:00]  So, what was it?  A Band-Aid or just a fat lip?  Well, there were stitches.  I had torn my lip down to my chin.  And so, I had 12 stitches in there and a little Band-Aid covered up the...  Okay.  That was the deal.  Are we up for a round of Brady trivia today?  I don't know.  All I know is I'm looking at Britney Spears.  And Beachy last time, Barry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I know we did.  I know that.  Look at Britney Spears.  I let him wear it.  Come on, man.  Wait a second.  Britney Spears.  She's sunbathing.  She's topless, but she's laying on her belly.  But look at right here.  Look at that bit of... 
[01:30:30]  I'm looking at a different one now.  It's going to be popping up.  Britney thing is all right.  It's all right.  Yeah.  See, I was...  I all of a sudden got pulled away from the penis puppetry site.  Have you heard of high-speed DSL?  Yeah.  Well, when you have a whole country of people hitting this exact site right now...  Anytime.  It doesn't matter.  It takes a while.  I'm telling you guys, you've got to step up to the plate.  You know, I want to see...  Yeah.  You've got to get these chairs reupholstered.  I know.  Gold plate these mics.  It's not treating us better.  Come on, man.  They're supposed to redo the studio, but I don't know what's going on with that. 
[01:31:00]  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.  Hello.  You're on the show.  Let's go.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Barry, I have a question for you.  What's up?  Whenever they did the beginning of the sitcom, how come the house was backwards?  It never made sense to me.  It's always backwards, but because we were testing our viewers to see...  We have no idea.  They shot...  You know, one group, one unit shot that, and then another unit made the house, so they  just never matched.  But it wasn't until years later that anybody ever really picked up on it.  No, I picked up on it right away.  I'm a Brady Bunch fan. 
[01:31:30]  You didn't pick up on it.  I always will be.  But, Amy, who cares?  Yeah, really.  That's why...  I just needed to know.  I just wanted to know.  I thought maybe they were filming backwards on that one shot.  And I love you.  I love you for needing to know.  That's like Star Trek crap, where they really get too into the show.  She didn't notice that either.  Somebody told her, and she's like, yeah, you're right.  What'd he say?  Nothing.  All right.  Thank you, Amy.  Thanks, Amy.  Thanks, Amy.  All right.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Could it be a car phone?  Bill?  Hello. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I'm here, guys.  Sorry about that.  Jesus.  Go ahead.  What's up?  I'd be on speaker phone.  You guys gotta play.  I'm the real Greg Brady.  All right.  We can do that.  You gotta play that before he goes.  We're gonna do it right now as we go to break.  How's that?  Fantastic.  And when we come back, it's Barry Williams helping us out with the penis puppet  tears.  Oh, jeez.  Greg Brady.  Don't say Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg, Greg, Greg.  May I have your attention, please?  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I repeat.  May I have your attention, please?  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up? 
[01:32:30]  That's me, of course.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're gonna have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Belt bottles, polyester, hip bands, orange hair.  Was it permed?  Was it real?  Hey, who does it care?  Here's the story.  Here's the story of a guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real that 70s show?  And oh, Alice O prepared Sam's meat for free.  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Wait.  No, wait.  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?  And Mike Brady said, nothing, you idiots. 
[01:33:00]  Like Tiger, he's dead.  Cindy had a little Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him.  Look at him.  Walking around wearing his tiki guard.  Surfing and wiping out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  It was cool for a while being a teenage star.  But now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new, but I'm Greg Brady, too.  Football into Martian's nose.  Sing the chorus and it goes.  I'm Greg Brady.  Yes, I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up. 
[01:33:30]  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady, so stop.  You're imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  I grew up.  Please shut up.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who was dating who.  It was all TV.  Wasn't real.  Just plight.  Back then, you couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  TV.  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night, you light up a TV and then you see some wannabe trying to be me.  Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me.  Barry Williams, Johnny Bravo. 
[01:34:00]  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got AKAs coming out the wazoo.  I dig M&M and Clark Bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do toot and I still fit that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine day.  Hey!  I'm Greg Brady and I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Grady's are not syndicated.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady, I was slim and shady. 
[01:34:30]  You ain't Greg Brady.  Please shut up.  Don't suck up.  Please grow up.  I gotta get out of this time warp.  I mean, how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right-hand corner or anything?  I was a kid at Rock when Kid Rock was just a kid.  And Uncle Cracker was somebody's nephew.  I'd love to stay.  I gotta go because something suddenly came up.  Well, you guys are both stupid. 
[01:35:00]  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.

O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Barry Williams in the studio, the real great Brady.  We love when he stops by.  Stuff always happens when he comes by. 
[01:36:30]  And today we have some stuff happening here in the studio that's a little different than we're all used to.  Yeah, the Penis Puppeteers, Anthony.  The Penis Puppeteers.  I've looked at a couple of pictures of their work, their gentle origami.  And I looked at the hamburger, which is interesting.  It looked like they were holding small little hamburgers in their hands.  Sounds like a package of junk.  Yeah.  It was exactly what it was made out of.  The Loch Ness Monster, though. 
[01:37:00]  Come on.  The Loch Ness Monster looked like the photo of Nessie we've all seen in the books.  The Eiffel Tower.  And what was the other one?  The last one.  Oh, the snail.  The snail's pretty funny.  Do you achieve the hamburger thing by trying to excite yourself in a blender?  No, no.  It actually...  I don't know what they'd do if they actually got excited because it would ruin their gig.  They needed to be...  Ours, too, guys.  Yeah, really.  Exactly.  Keep an eye out on everyone's laptop. 
[01:37:30]  Let's ask Robert Reed.  From the pictures.  From the pictures, it looks like they need a lot of pliability to their junk.  Like the hamburger, it looks like what they do is they take the main part of your junk and kind of wrap it.  Wrap it into a circle.  Then they take one of your yams from your yam bag, put it on the bottom, and one on top to make the bun, and then kind of press it down.  And it looks like two buns with a hamburger in the middle. 
[01:38:00]  And their website is linked at foundrymusic.com so you can see these pictures for yourself.  Are you doing pictures?  Are you doing pictures?  I don't know.  Well, at the worst, they have a website and we can do that.  Eric has a quick question for Barry Williams.  Eric.  Hey, Barry.  How you doing?  All right, man.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Did you see that last Portrait family movie where you guys were staring each other down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did that really happen?  Of course not.  I don't know whose imagination that was.  Yeah.  It was completely ridiculous.  Can you look at that little red-headed freak? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, he produced it, Danny Bonaduce.  But can you imagine Shirley Jones and the cast coming out, getting in their bus from Screen  Gyms, coming over to Paramount and calling us out on the floor?  Yeah, no, I don't think so.  That's kind of silly.  I mean, people would like to see that or think, but shit, you know.  We were on the same network, same time.  No, we were.  No.  Danny Bonaduce, though, normally tells it like it is.  Yeah, exactly.  Didn't he beat up Robert Reed after that episode?  Yeah, I think he did.  Yeah.  Remember the transvestites? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I see.  I see what you're saying.  We were talking about Robert Reed, you know, the father there, Mike Brady.  And after that, I remember him doing an episode of Medical Center, I guess it was.  That's right, Chad Everett.  Yeah, yes, Chad Everett.  Chad Everett.  Medical Center.  And he played a transsexual, a guy going through an operation to become a woman.  And he had to dress as a woman for the show, and I guess he was up for, what, an Emmy  or something?  Yeah, an Emmy Award for that, right, right.  And it just freaked everyone out, because you're used to watching him as Mr. Brady. 
[01:39:30]  Mr. Wholesome Brady.  I think that whole thing was so that he could just finally have himself.  Finally wear a dress.  You know, he could have himself.  Without a problem.  I am beautiful.  Look at me.  No one better than me, Greg.  No one better than me.  Greg, Peter, Bobby, I'm naked.  I just wanted to let everyone know that lots of women are coming into the studio now to  help us.  Thank God.  With the penis puppeteers so we don't feel as gay.  And attractive women are coming in here.  Right?  Yes.  Joe, what's going on? 
[01:40:00]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  You're on the radio, Joe.  Let's go.  Speak.  Hey, Barry.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm on, too.  Do people actually think that you're Greg Brady?  Hey, good question, man.  Very good.  Yeah, sometimes they really will not let me get away with, you know, say, no, my name  is Barry.  No, no, no, no, it's not.  Hey, Greg Brady.  They say, well, not to me.  Walking down the street.  They get mad, you know.  The first thing, do you get more Greg Brady or more, hey, Barry Williams?  It's starting to change.  I've been.  Really?  I've always had more Greg, and now it's starting to get more Barry. 
[01:40:30]  It's good after 27 years.  Right.  Exactly.  After, yeah, 27 years.  Please.  Greg Brady.  Oh, ow.  Okay, man.  Sorry.  JC, what's up?  Hey.  JC.  Yo, dude.  What's up?  What's up?  You guys got the FHM magazine?  Barry brought it in.  Barry brought it in.  Nicky Cox on the cover.  Oh, man.  The cover is so bad.  Unbelievable.  Isn't it?  The cover is so bad.  Look at that right boob. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  It's pretty much just exposed.  If you go to page 118 in this one in this FHM, that's where those girls there, that's the  S-Club girls.  S-Club 7 girls.  And I've been working with them all year.  Now, what is your capacity with these people?  Well, and...  Johnny Bravo's now a manager?  Actually, I'm their massage therapist.  You wish.  Yeah, because you've got to get them relaxed before the concert and stuff.  It's the way I manage.  No, it's Dean Strickland is my name. 
[01:41:30]  Dean the Machine.  It's a kid's show.  What can I tell you?  But the girls are hot.  Yes, they are.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm looking at their pictures in there.  It's on Fox Family?  Fox Family.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They're in 109 different countries, these girls.  At once, simultaneously.  Nice.  Look at this.  Come on.  Yeah.  Is this a gig?  Is that a gig or what?  You did that?  Yeah.  You didn't do that?  I didn't do it.  Do it. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  I think it's time for the penis puppeteers.  Oh, my God.  Time for some uncomfortable radio.  We've got the girls in the studio.  Here we go.  Taking their way into the studio.  David and Simon.  How are you guys doing?  You're from Australia?  Absolutely.  Mike?  Absolutely.  You guys got to share that, Mike.  Rip it up.  All right.  No worries.  Two days ago, a soul rigged out of a hole, that tanker.  I like that movie.  What the hell did you decide?  I was a road warrior.  Come on.  That was great.  Great movie came out of your country there.  Mad Max, we called it back home.  Wasn't that great?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The second one. 
[01:42:30]  The first one was a little cheesy.  The second one was great.  And the third one was, you know, we don't need another hero.  Get out of here.  Tina killed me.  Did you guys watch the Brady Bunch growing up?  Absolutely.  If you told me three years ago that I was going to be showing Greg Brady my knob, I'd never  get a job.  Right?  Imagine that.  I can't wait till I tell everyone back home.  Oh, great.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, let me know.  Is this something that you do in the pub?  I mean, you know, you're out and you have a couple of beers.  That's where it all started.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's very famous in the street.  A drunken puppy.  Now we only do it in the theater.  In the theater.  Give us a little background on how it did start and progressed into becoming where people  pay to go to a theater and watch you play with your junk like that.  I started in the bath.  Yeah?  As you all did.  As a kid?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, who can remember in the bath and you would take your fingers, pull the sides out,  make the airplane and go like, meh.  See, that was your one.  Right.  Everyone has their own little one that they did. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I did bat wings.  What was the first one?  I did bat wings.  You did the bat wings with the tumors in the wings?  Is that what you meant?  And what was your first one?  Well, at that time, it was the little girl, but we now call it the woman.  Oh, where you just...  And everyone does it.  You tuck it down?  We call that the turtle.  We've also got another one where we take a little too far.  It's a little more graphic than just the tuck, I'm afraid.  Really?  Yeah.  Totally correct.  How does that work?  Well, you might have to come to the show to see that.  Oh, gee.  Well, maybe I just won't see it. 
[01:44:00]  You guys do it.  You have an actual show where people come and you're on stage in a spotlight.  People go there.  Don't say they come there.  They just go there to watch the...  Right.  Thank you, Barry.  I think every man dreams of traveling the world, getting his penis out for an hour a night  and getting paid for it.  All right.  I could see that happening.  It's totally non-sexual.  It's all for a laugh.  But do you have guys coming to your shows?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  In Australia, it's mostly guys.  This started as a... 
[01:44:30]  Well, I mean, as you guys know, it was secret men's business.  Right.  You know, but we're just...  Mostly guys?  Really?  In Australia?  That's something.  Is there a camera on it with a screen so people in the back can see?  Oh, yeah.  Two-story hot penis.  That's what I'm saying.  That's not a bad seat in the house.  Now, that's something I've dreamed for.  Look at Jim caring about the people in the back row.  That's good, Jim.  Is there a screen?  Because, you know...  Because I'll be in the front row.  I hate to think...  Because I can't have your lunch looking small.  Exactly.  That's funny. 
[01:45:00]  So, you did that, but how did you make the transition to just kind of doing it yourself  and all of a sudden it becomes a show where you're showing people?  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  I think it's just been taken way too far.  I mean, we did it for the Melbourne Comedy Festival back in 98 and we actually did it as a joke.  We were going to go on a similar radio station to this with some friends back home  and we were going to get all the theatre critics in expecting them to slam it.  And, you know, we're going to go, oh, this is outrageous. 
[01:45:30]  Come on, it's hard.  And they called us the outright best show of the festival and we've just been waiting  for someone to tell us to stop it ever since, really.  Oh, whatever works, man.  So, what kind of fan mail do you get and who do you get it from?  Oh, no, we really don't get fan mail.  We get the odd stalker.  Yes, yeah.  The overexcited housewife, perhaps.  But, no, we really don't get groupies in puppetry, Penis.  That's one of the warm-ups.  Is that what that is?  Sorry, we're being distracted.  I want to know from the girls that are in here, do girls like seeing men manipulate 
[01:46:00]  themselves?  Oh, there you go.  Ladies?  Into puppets?  Ladies?  Anybody?  They're looking through one of those little thumb books, you know, where you flip the pages  and it's a movie?  Can you let me...  Wow.  Now, uh...  I think there's your answer, Barry.  Yeah.  Are you happy with your size and everything?  You've got to be happy with what God gives you, really, don't you?  Right.  Have you noticed that using it in this fashion for so long has made it longer? 
[01:46:30]  Well, yes.  Yeah.  But we don't like to say that too much.  We don't want to see boys hanging themselves off the clothesline, you know?  Right.  It takes time.  Yeah, look, I mean, the more you do stretch and give it a bit of a tug, it does.  It becomes a little more flexible.  I've been tugging mine since I was 12 and it doesn't seem to make a difference the way  I do it.  Do you find that Asian men will try these tricks and give up in disgust?  That's why they do it with paper.  Look, I met the dragon. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, watch what I can do.  Dave, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Well, we're hanging with the penis guy.  I know.  I actually hung out a little bit in Scotland for the Fringe Festival and got to see these  guys.  They're phenomenal.  Great.  They had like a couple of weeks worth of shows.  I cannot believe the endurance.  They had these TV cramers and this big screen so everyone could see it in the audience.  It's sold out.  Dave, I've got to ask you, did you feel gay, though, watching this?  No, not so much. 
[01:47:30]  I'm a performer as well.  Not that kind of performer, but I can understand the artist's reality.  Love it.  Okay.  Very cool, man.  Barry Williams, is it true that in the episode of the Brady Bunch where the silver platter,  you had to pay for the engraving on the silver platter, instead of going out and singing songs  of the girls, that Greg, Peter, and Bobby were just going to manipulate their junk for money  in front of their father just to pay for it.  I heard a rumor about that.  Strangely enough, that was discussed. 
[01:48:00]  But during the commercials, it never made it to the air.  Damn.  Okay.  See, because I did hear a rumor that.  It's good just to flush those things out.  I would actually do a pretty good impersonation of Sam the Butcher.  That was your man.  Bloody mess.  Hey.  Hey, they said they have to broadcast it on TV so the people in the back can see it.  Have you ever thought about making an IMAX version?  IMAX.  20 stories high?  20 stories high.  How old?  That was fun.  Whatever IMAX movie is. 
[01:48:30]  Nice and large.  Oh, yeah.  You love your big penises, don't you?  Yep.  Thank you.  So what should we do?  Should we take a break and then have them do a few tricks?  I guess so.  Ladies are...  Look, the ladies are all getting worked up about this, aren't they?  Hey, what do you think of that crocodile, honey guy?  Oh, he's not cute.  Yeah.  He's pretty popular over here.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't watch him back home.  I guess not.  He's just an idiot.  Tell him what.  He's crazy. 
[01:49:00]  Anyone who jumps in a pen with a crocodile has got something loose.  Right.  Don't let the kids watch him.  There you go.  Watch penis manipulation.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hello.  You're on the radio.  What's going on?  I just wanted to say how much I love the book.  The book?  Oh, you got the book?  You got a book?  Yep, I got the book.  It's an instructional manual, how to do them.  Oh, it is?  Yep.  And what are you doing with that, miss?  I use it as a coffee table conversation piece. 
[01:49:30]  A lot of conversation.  You might as well plug the book.  What's the book?  Yeah, it's called...  Well, it hasn't been released.  You can get it on Amazon.com.  Yeah, I got it over the internet.  Puppetry for the penis.  Yeah.  Puppetry for the penis.  Okay.  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  And Lou's got a question about tickets.

I'm straight.  But I need...  But I want to pay money to see men's penises.

And that's...  He needs to shuffle a few in his day, I'm sure.  Yeah?  I wouldn't doubt it, sure.  When are you guys playing there?  October 5th?  Yep.  Well, the previews start with tomorrow night, actually.  Tomorrow night?  And then we open October 5th.  And who knows?  It all depends on how long New York loves...

[01:52:30]  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the studio.  Barry Williams.  Yeah.  Here for Barry.  He's going to be on The Weakest Link tonight.  Eight o'clock.  The Weakest Link?  With the whole Brady cast and Oliver, we found out.  And a little spoiler, we can all laugh along as Oliver is the first one thrown off as The Weakest Link.  As he was in the TV show, too, and in life.  Thank you.  No problem. 
[01:53:00]  He wrecked everyone's career.  No problem.  Brady Bunch is going along fine.  They've got to drag his sorry ass in there.  What was that about?  And Anthony, the penis puppeteers.  David and Simon.  From Australia.  And their penises.  They look like Art Garfunkel and Lenny from Motorhead, don't they?  I love that Lenny.  You look just like him.  I see something going on there.  So, yeah, they're doing a show in New York.  It debuts October 5th.  You've got to give the info again, because I don't have it in front of me. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, sure.  You can get the tickets from Telecharge.  And it's 212-239-6200.  Previews start tomorrow night.  And lots of cheap tickets.  And is that what theater?  It's a John Houseman theater.  Right, exactly.  Okay.  All right, I guess we're ready.  John Houseman.  What a fespian.  And look at what's going on in this theater.  Ladies, are you guys ready to see some tricks?  Yeah.  Can we shuffle a couple of quick ones?  Hey, if you guys get excited at any point, doesn't that ruin the gig?  It cannot happen, I'm afraid. 
[01:54:00]  You can't.  It can't, right.  Because it's got to be pliable.  Well, the thing is, if there's 300 people laughing at your genitals, it's just never going to happen.  I guess so.  There you go.  Just think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  You've got a point.  All right.  Oh, look who's here.  Stalker Patty showed up, too.  I want to see some junk.  What do we want to see first?  I don't know, but Rick is in my way.  All right.  Back up so everyone can see.  Hey, Anthony.  Is Stalker Patty in that new Michael Douglas movie?  I'll never tell you.  I'll never tell you.  Look, she's got the body of an ant. 
[01:54:30]  Does she have the body of an ant?  Looks like an ant.  Look at my thorax and my abdomen.  How are you doing, Patty?  Very good.  You ready to see some man junk?  Yeah.  When was the last time you saw a naked man?  I don't know.  I think Ron Jeremy.  You never saw Ron Jeremy.  You know Ron Jeremy?  Yeah.  She put her hand down Ron Jeremy's face, didn't she?  Exactly.  She never saw it.  This girl lady thing has never seen a...  I parked the car so I could listen to that. 
[01:55:00]  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we had U2 tickets and we made Ron Jeremy stick them under his yam bag and she had to  go grab and dig and manipulate to find these tickets.  And she's a virgin.  She's a 45-year-old virgin.  She's never seen a man's unit and that was the first time she ever touched it and it's  Ron Jeremy's.  And she says the reason she hasn't touched on it is she's waiting for the right person.  Again, Ron Jeremy was the right person. 
[01:55:30]  It's practically a virgin itself.  Right person.  She caught 20 diseases just touching it.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike, real fast.  Yeah, man, I just wanted to give the penis puppet kids an idea.  Maybe they could stretch out their junk by hanging them from the swing set like Bobby Brady  in that episode.  No, Bobby was complaining that he was too short.  You might remember that one, Barry.  Yeah, I do remember that.  As a matter of fact, I was in the dress room banging Marsha.  Never mind.  Brady Bunch references always, always, always funny. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  I'm just, I'm wondering if the puppet, the penis puppeteers have any, any of their, twist  them out so they need four hands and maybe, maybe, Patty can get in there.  Some kind of a, no.  Patty can get in there with a couple of hands.  No one joins in to help you out, right?  We do.  And you don't manipulate each other.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm clear.  Wait or anything?  We do have a, we do have a quick clip of Patty going for the U2 tickets.  Do we? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, just to get everyone on the same page.  So, uh, going into Ron Jeremy's, uh, pants for the U2 tickets.  Listen.  Patty has never, uh, no, oh, no, never.  Never.  Yeah.  She's never had any kind of contact with that part of a man in her life.  Yeah.  All right.  Now I'm dizzy.  Now I'm dizzy.  I can't believe it.  I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round.  Oh, you're on a merry-go-round.  Please.  Okay, the ticket's away. 
[01:57:00]  There you go.  All right.  You follow my voice.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh, there she is on the stomach.  She's searching.  She's not touching.  She's touching.  Stomach.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, she's going in his pants.  She's going in.  She's going in.  She went down Ron Jeremy's pants.  Ron, how much did she feel?  She glazed along the side of the swamp.  She brushed the side of the legendary Ron Jeremy song.  Here's the bad part.  Oh, my God.  John Tesh at Red Rocks. 
[01:57:30]  He's my favorite family.  Are you more excited about you two, or that you've finally touched man junk in all these  years?  She's got it right to the side, man.  She's pretty good at that.  I don't think she's a virgin.  I don't know what I...  I don't know.  I brushed up against something, but I don't know what it was.  It was filet of...  Did she give you a little...  Tell you what...  It was a pound of beef and a bucket of balls.  She's done this before.  Tell you what we're going to do.  We're going to upgrade your tickets, Patty, to the front row, but... 
[01:58:00]  You want a front row upgrade?  Open wide.  Yeah.  All right.  That clip's okay.  Then she had to go for the money.  The spending money.  And then we had more spending money in her underwear, and we made Ron Jeremy pull it  out of her underwear.  I think he grabbed, like, a bowling ball at some point in that exchange.  As only he can.  Right.  All right.  Big, meaty Ron Jeremy hand all over her virginal 45-year-old.  You know, we've stalled enough. 
[01:58:30]  We've got to...  All right.  All right, ladies.  Very excited, ladies, about singing this?  Great.  All right.  Here they go.  They're sick of cheeks.  Norton critiquing their asses.  They're working it now.  They're kind of stretching it out.  They're warming it up, man.  Warming it up, and then they will manipulate them into various shapes.  We're all going to have to go out and play football right after this, you know?  Oh, my God! 
[01:59:00]  What's the matter, Rick?  Rick, what's wrong?  This is a snail.  Here we go.  That is indeed a snail.  I hate those in France, you know.  They're opposing snails.  Right.  One's going left and one's going right.  So, the yam bag on top.  Patty might pass out, because this is the first time she's ever seen a metal jump.  Patty, what's up?  Metal jump.  Very interesting.  Unfortunately, she now thinks that's what it looks like normally. 
[01:59:30]  The Eiffel Tower.  The Eiffel Tower.  Look at the Eiffel Tower.  The Eiffel Tower.  Rick, Rick, talk to the ladies.  Talk to the ladies.  You shouldn't be able to do that.  That's not right.  Doesn't that hurt?  Wow, Rachel's turning red.  Look at Rachel.  I've never seen anything.  How about that?  The Eiffel Tower.  I have nothing to say.  I have nothing.  I have a question.  Do you play with these and then come up with a shape and then name it, or do you name 
[02:00:00]  it first and then try and find it?  Yeah, you play with it first.  But these have been around for a long time.  I see.  You've just perfected them.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe you should turn around and tell us, or we should guess.  Okay.  See if you can guess which this one is.  It's a very famous mystery from around the world.  All right.  Can you put them together and make the varizano?  Oh, what is that?  The Loch Ness Monster.  That's old Nessie.  That's Nessie.  I hate that I knew that. 
[02:00:30]  This is so gay, man.  Oh, that's Nessie.  Looks like a camel, I guess.  A camel?  Oh, it's got two humps.  Right.  Could be a camel.  But it's the Loch Ness Monster.  Sure.  Right.  Very good.  You guys, you like the Loch Ness Monster?  Yes.  Okay.  The snail is hilarious.  Oh, it's the hamburger.  Oh, the hamburger.  Yes, this is a favorite in the photos.  Oh, my God.  The hamburger.  Look at them working in it.  I am afraid. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  The hamburger.  The hamburger.  The hamburger is a big hit with the ladies.  Oh.  Oh.  That looks like it would hurt a little bit.  Hey, check out my sesame seeds.  Check out my sesame seeds.  All right.  Instructions.  He's showing us how to make the ham. 
[02:01:30]  And then roll it under.  You've got to eat.  It's sideways.  Stand on a 90-foot angle.  Ouch.  And then hold it.  Like a hamburger.  By the way, Steve is filming this for FoundryMusic.com.  Did it come to a non-pain factor or did it never hurt?  Guys can manipulate.  Do the hamburger.  Yeah, ladies.  Yeah, ladies.  Right?  I learned this on Opie. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Look at this.  It's like.  Of course.  Now, when you do your show, do you ask for volunteers from the audience?  Of course.  I'll show you the baby.  All right.  The baby bird, Anthony.  The baby bird.  And listen, it says, feed me.  Feed me.  What the hell is that?  What is that?  Hot dog.  Hot dog. 
[02:02:30]  It's similar to the ham.  The baby bird?  Yeah.  The baby bird is very funny.  He pulls some skin off.  I'm really pointing, Seth.  Oh, we've got a.  Around the top and works it like a mouth of a baby bird.  That was very.  We do it in the show.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Can you do it circumcised or uncircumcised?  Well, we're both circumcised.  But, I mean, we're actually, as we mentioned before, we're actually looking, always looking 
[02:03:00]  for new people to join our show.  New talent.  Yes.  We haven't found an uncircumcised person yet.  So, I mean, that would open a whole new window.  Oh, my God.  Imagine.  Try England.  Bring them on.  Imagine the things you can make with that.  Surely there's one here in New Yorkshire.  He's holding the microphone in front of you.  Rick's got a peeler.  Sleeping bag. 
[02:03:30]  A sleeping bag.  He's got a skivvy.  That's good.  The peeler.  Patty, Patty, what did you think there, Patty?  The Big Mac was interesting.  You like the hamburger?  She liked the hamburger.  She works at McDonald's, so she's never going to look at those the same way again.  I get all aroused when I look at a hamburger.  The baby bird is worth the price of admission.  That's pretty good. 
[02:04:00]  Hilarious.  That looked like a baby bird.  What is the windsurfer?  I keep hearing about the windsurfer.  Oh, yeah.  The windsurfer.  You just can't get enough, can you?  You made a skivvy.  Thanks, Thorne.  They took their...  Oh, yes!  Oh, my...  That's all right, man.  That's all right.  Oh, my God.  Look at yourself.  You're like, do it yourself.  Looks like a damn boomerang.  I mean, I'm not even a guy, and that's just like... 
[02:04:30]  He can pull.  Look how red Rachel's getting.  Yeah.  So funny.  That yam bag gets pulled out so far.  What do you think of the windsurfer?  It becomes a sail.  That was the most horrifyingly painful-looking thing I've ever seen in my life.  Unless you blow on it.  Oh, look at it.  You're a little taken aback at the size?  Slightly, yes.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, these girls are sweaty.  See what happens when you tug on it like that? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  See?  Wow.  Mary needs some air, man.  Look at that.  Mary's thinking, what the hell guys have I been with if this is a guy just not even excited?  I just doubled my number today, man.  But I didn't think I'd see it like that.  You got a boat out of it.  That's a big mule, and you can make a boat out of it.  Yeah, definitely.  And if you were black, we'd push Leon Klinghoffer off the side. 
[02:05:30]  Are you guys desensitized as a result of this?  Are you able to have regular sex?  Or does it not feel as good?  Would you like me to show you?  That works perfectly fine.  Thanks for your concern, though.  Oh, man.  You guys definitely don't have girlfriends or wives.  That's his girlfriend right there.  Talk to her.  You don't mind that he's shown his junk to everybody?  No, I don't mind.  She's so proud. 
[02:06:00]  He's been doing it for longer than he's known me, so I can't control the beast.  Yeah.  It's got a mind of a thongue.  He's just, like, in the middle of the night, go, look what I did.  And, like, all of a sudden, he's, like, showing you some new work or anything, no?  He squashed his nuts up on the shower one morning and showed me the, um...  Squashed rat.  The squashed rat.  Squashed rat!  Or the stingray.  What, against the glass shower door?  The stingray?  The squash rat sounds hysterical. 
[02:06:30]  If you got a...  Oh, no.  Wait, what is he doing?  He's going to do the squash rat.  Oh, look out, Rick.  What is he doing?  I'm wondering how they met.  Now, can she do anything special with her genitals?  He's doing the squashed rat right now, man.  I see.  Squashed rat.  These guys are out of their minds.  What is he doing? 
[02:07:00]  The stingray.  The stingray?  I think he's just wiping the cup from your window.  Hey, uh...  Ryan, what's going on?  Guys, man, every video show is getting dumped out.  Like, every two seconds, it's...  I can't...  I'm not getting anything of what's going on.  I know this guy's showing off his package here, but no one can figure out what's happening  here.  Why are they dumping?  Why?  I don't know.  Dude, I just...  I got in the car, and I'm driving around, and, like, I'm hearing something, and then,  you know, when you hit the dump, and it cuts to, like, something totally different, 
[02:07:30]  and the show's getting all slow, because you can tell you've been dumping a ton of times,  man.  Nothing's making it on the air.  What are they dumping out of?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's the point.  I can't tell what they're dumping out of, because I don't hear it.  All right.  Well, dude, it's funny.  It's mouth-watering.  It sounds hilarious as hell, but...  Oh, Jesus.  And what's even funnier is that Greg Brady's there watching it.  That's the best part.  All right, you guys rock.  I got to dance.  I'm the one they're dumping on.  Yeah, I don't...  What city is he in?  Oh, that's New York.  Really? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, New York.  That's weird.  Oh, my God.  That is really weird.  Shocking.  Someone upstairs pushing the button.  Yeah, that's all right.  I mean, uh...  Well, I want to guess...  I'm not seeing a lot of reports of that coming in on instant feedback, and I think the point's  getting across.  Now, how many of these puppets can you make, roughly?  We do about 45 in the show, but we've got about 60.  Wow.  Yeah.  Also, you have some for an encore.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  I see.  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what the showstopper is.  Yeah.  Ah, well, we won't spoil it, but I can say there's a bit of an event, a bit of a stunt 
[02:08:30]  that we pull.  Huh.  Is it to music?  Uh, we used to work with a penis.  I think I'll go for a walk out today.  It's a sunshine day.  We just got a penis on stage.  A penis.  I mean...  A penis.  But basically, I mean, we have an expression back in Australia, I think they're about to  dump us again, you can't polish a turd.  Right.  And I think we seem to have polished a turd.  We did a season in the London West End, and then we had to start working with, you know,  like, lighting design and music and all that sort of stuff. 
[02:09:00]  But there's still a couple of guys making shapes out of the genitals, really.  Right.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Well...  But, you know, with a few Broadway frills.  I would not have believed it.  You guys do...  I absolutely would not have believed it.  You do kid parties?  By mitzvahs.  By mitzvahs?  Usually we can do most of the Muppets.  That's right.  Most of the Muppets.  You want to see my gonzo?  All right, well...  He's going to do gonzo.  He'll see a gonzo.  And just don't...  Oh, ladies, just don't describe, you know, what they're doing is, I guess, the problem 
[02:09:30]  they're having.  Here he is.  Too much description.  Oh, my God.  Gonzo.  There you have it, ladies.  Gonzo.  Oh, man.  And this is...  He's got a doubly eyes, hasn't he?  And this is, incidentally, how Jim Henson got into trouble.  He...  It was Gonzo.  Oh, wow.  Don't let me hold that mic there. 
[02:10:00]  Mary, you all right?  Looks like you're going to pass it out.  Look at how red she is.  Dude, she's sweating.  And she's sweating.  Sweating.  You're sweating.  What's the matter?  Boy, she's not going to be a fun date.  They must have jumped out of that.  She's all freaked out because, let's just put it this way, one of the puppeteers was grabbing  her hair.  If that freaks you out, the window's definitely going to come down.  God, lighten up. 
[02:10:30]  It's only hepatitis.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, I wouldn't know if they were going to give him the Roman war helmet.  Oh.  He just did the Gonzo, which is similar to the Roman war helmet.  Do you know what the Roman war helmet is?  No.  You do the Gonzo, but you do it over...  You take one nugget over a girl's face.  You take one nugget over one eye, one over the other, and the rest of it goes down the  nose like the Roman war helmet.  Show me, Mary.  Come on.  All right, cracky. 
[02:11:00]  You guys suck.  All right.  I would love to see the Roman war helmet.  They don't have to place it on...  You know what I mean?  If it was close enough, that could be really funny.  Well, Mary?  Too close for me.  What do you think, Mary?  Come on, sister.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  It'd be fun.  It'd be so fun.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  So like that?  And then it flops down on the eyes.  No.  No.  All right.  She's not going for it. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, like, I like the view from my standpoint, but I don't need, like, that smell and the  sticky, wet, slimy, growing...  How old are you girls?  Eight?  I mean...  And it sticks out from his body.  Have you been?  How do I know?  Slow down.  Slow down.  They're going to dump out of that crap.  Buy me dinner or something first.  That is dinner.  How about just the money it would cause for dinner?  30 bucks?  Well, you know what?  Anything to pay for college.  All right.  Let's go to Diane. 
[02:12:00]  Diane, what's up?  Hey, I'm from D.C., and this is the funniest bit I've ever heard.  You guys are hysterical.  Are they ever going to be anywhere else in the country?  No.  No.  They're going to dump out of that.  See where that should be.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Diane, I don't know.  They're going to be in New York for a while, and then who knows?  You never know.  Oh, this is hysterical.  The ladies appreciate it, and you guys are just cracking us up.  We'll bring them to one of our road shows in a second.  Absolutely.  Hey, look, we've got four troops going around the world at the moment. 
[02:12:30]  It's a franchise now.  We're franchising.  You're right.  So that guy who rang up before us saw us in Edinburgh was actually our second troop.  Right.  We're the original guys, and that's why we're here.  They're franchised.  They're all the cockatums.  Yeah.  Diane, I don't know what they dumped out of, but these guys have a website, and we took video today.  Steve's going to put it up on our underground website, foundrymusic.com, after the show, all right?  I don't know where that guy was calling from, because we've gotten almost to it here in D.C.  They didn't dump out down here.  You heard the Loch Ness Monster, the... 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, and the baby bird.  Okay.  Yeah, so we're not getting dumped out.  What about the hamburger?  The hamburger make it on there?  Yeah, we heard the hamburger, and yeah.  The snail?  Pardon?  The snail?  The snail was the first one.  The snail, yeah, the double snail.  And the windsurfer.  And the windsurfer?  The windsurfer, yeah, we got it all.  Oh, good, okay.  All right, maybe it wasn't as bad as we thought.  We're getting it all down here.  Good day.  All right, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  So does this officially mean you're going from whip it out, whip them out Wednesdays to twist 
[02:13:30]  them up Thursdays?  No.  No, no.  You know, I got to say something.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a beating for this.  I didn't feel that gay.  No.  You didn't feel that gay?  I didn't feel that gay checking this out.  Because they don't act gay.  They're men.  They don't act gay.  They're like guys.  They're just twisting their junk around.  Because it would be too bad if guys didn't check this out because they thought it was  like a gay show.  It's hilarious.  Well, I got to tell you, and it's the perfect show for men.  Men, this is the perfect first date show. 
[02:14:00]  You bring a girl along, she's like, gets you home, great, get them out.  I want to get my hands on them.  I want to make some shakes.  I want to make some things out of them.  It's a great first date show.  Breaks the ice, so to speak.  You forget they're mules after a while.  No, you don't.  After five minutes, it could be an elbow.  The windsurfer?  That didn't look like a mule, you know?  But then again, I've never seen a sailboat leak.  Aww. 
[02:14:30]  The aw from the crowd.  The aw from the crowd.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  We got a quick clip for you.  Yeah.  Break the bang!  Break the bang!  I think you got something about Mary.  Oh, all right.  Thank you, bro.  Break the bang!  No, I got it.  Break the bang!  Okay.  Whatever the hell.  Alan, what's up?  I want them to know, how long is this show that they put on? 
[02:15:00]  One hour.  One hour?  You'd do that for an hour?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Okay, thanks, buddy.  Huh?  Say that again?  They have a comic going up first.  I think it's Cynthia Levin, who's very funny, and doing a half hour, and then them for an  hour.  Correct.  And it's Corey.  Do you guys have, like, music and stuff, a stage show, or is it just...  Well, we have musical stings and stuff that go along with it.  Yeah.  And we also reintroduce each installation in an amusing hatter.  Barry, what'd you think? 
[02:15:30]  I am wowed.  I am stupefired.  You're a bit worried at the start.  I was a little worried at the start.  But, you know, coming from Australia, I knew, you know, you're going to be straight blokes,  right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I don't have any of those people there.  You're right, Opie.  It's not gay at all.  No.  It's just weird.  And that's just so cute.  That's just cute.  You want to kiss it?  You know, it's not.  No, no, no.  Barry, can you help clear up another rumor I heard?  Is it true that when Marcia couldn't get Davy Jones to sing at the prom, she was actually 
[02:16:00]  going to get the penis puppeteers to go to Fillmore Junior High?  I was going to arrange that, yeah.  Really, you're going to hook that up, yeah, I thought that was true.  Are you guys going to take the show on ice?  There you go.  I hope not.  It's a smaller show, I'm afraid.  Oh, you know what?  That was all right.  It's David and Simon, the penis puppeteers.  Yeah.  Thank you, and forgive me if we don't shake hands. 
[02:16:30]  Give the plug again, please.  One more plug.  It's at the John Houseman Theatre.  Previews start tomorrow, and lots of cheap tickets for the previews.

You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Still in the studio, Barry Williams, the real great Brady.  Hi, yeah.  Everyone's going to be on the weakest link tonight for the Brady Bunch.  All the Bradys.  Florence there, too.  Florence is there.  Yeah.  We feel privileged. 
[02:18:30]  And B. Davis.  Showing her the hungry bird.  Yeah.  Yeah, that beep, beep.  I've got to thank the penis puppeteers for stopping by.  That's pretty funny stuff.  I'm making diagrams here.  Trying to label them, memorize it.  Yeah, so you can do them at home.  Who's not trying some of these tricks when you get home?  You must.  You've got to have the visual.  I could not visualize this without actually seeing it.  You talk about it.  You do the hamburger.  Yeah.  I'm taking a ground round.  No, I mean, this is a deluxe.  Looks like a big hamburger. 
[02:19:00]  We do have video that will go up on foundrymusic.com.  So that way you can really get an idea of what was going on.  Because Wind Surfer.  You can practice.  It was amazing.  We got killed by the thump guy in that last segment.  Killed.  So I don't know how it sounded.  But we got some video and pictures that will be up on foundrymusic.com later on tonight.  Okay?  Yeah.  Always fun here with O&A.  Isn't it fun?  You never know what's going to happen, do you?  I'll be back in about two years.  Exactly.  He's a stupid mailman from Yonkers writes, what if they hit Maureen McCormick in the face with one of those puppets? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my nose.  And mashed potato head.  Hamburger.  Hopefully, there isn't any special sauce.  That old gag.  All right.  Yeah.  Recovering from that one.  A little much.  Certainly lots of bathroom humor for that.  Yeah.  They must have a whole patter that goes along with each puppet.  It's good to get back to the D jokes. 
[02:20:00]  Not like that.  It's been a little too serious around here.  You know something?  No, no.  Let me say something.  I don't like this at all.  Why?  Because the first nudity we have on our show since the disaster happened, the terrorist disaster, was guys.  Just shows we're not thinking right yet.  We're still a little, you know, effed up.  You know, this does now open up where naked girls are once again completely welcome to come down here. 
[02:20:30]  Right now.  Right now, as a matter of fact.  I want to have an American flag bikini contest.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That sounds patriotic.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to start doing some patriotic things.  That would entail them having some clothing on, though.  That's okay.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I want to see them, I want to see girls come down and do similar tricks with names like  the gopher hole.  Things like that, maybe.  Right?  The volcano.  The sewer. 
[02:21:00]  The volcano.  Yeah.  The melting candle.  The hidden cave.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, this is the cave that the Brady boys had to bring the tiki back to.  The Holland Tunnel, look.  Right, look.  Still closed.  And there's traffic building up.  Things like that.  Right.  Why not?  That's what I want to see.  The little man in the canoe.  Here it is.  The swamp.  Why can't we do that? 
[02:21:30]  Sure.  Venus flytrap.  Yeah.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  All you've got to do is figure out who developed the idea of the Am I Gay Contest.  All I have to ask is, with the whole thing with you guys always wondering, you know, when  you're going to bring in the next strip here, after you get over the whole homophobic aspect  of what you just had, was it really that funny?  It was hilarious, yeah.  Oh, without a doubt.  At first, you're like, okay, there's two guys naked in front of you, and you're feeling 
[02:22:00]  a little weird.  But then when you see the freaking snail, you just realize it's just funny stuff.  It really is.  There is a degree of creativity here, too, you know.  But it really looks like what they're saying.  The Loch Ness Monster, bro.  Man, it's hilarious.  Hey, you ripped me off.  It's going to be totally noon radio.  What's happening?  Totally noon.  Totally noon radio.  Totally noon.  So which one of you guys is going to try to carry this out when you go home?  I'm definitely trying the baby bird when I get home tonight.  You're going to... 
[02:22:30]  Now, is Sandy going to be asleep during this time?  Are you going to do it when she's awake?  No, let me tell you something about...  I'm going to practice in the shower, make sure it looks good, and then I'm going to present  the baby bird.  You can't just walk into the baby bird.  That's something...  It looked to me like that guy had been pulling various parts of that anatomy around for quite  a while for it to stretch enough to make it look like the beak of a baby bird.  I understand that, but the other ones looked a little painful.  I mean, the whole hamburger where you've got to twist it. 
[02:23:00]  No, there's no twisting like a doorknob.  Okay, and the snail, you know, you have to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Things that are usually on the bottom are now on top.  I don't like that either.  Right, right, right.  I'm not convinced that these are for amateurs, some of them.  Right.  I'm thinking the baby bird's the easiest one to try.  Could be.  It's going to look like the baby bird...  You're going to try the wind surfer, Barry?  On a very stormy day.  You know, it's not just the baby bird, it's the hungry baby bird.  That's what makes you a baby bird asking mommy for, you know...  You know what it's going to look like, though? 
[02:23:30]  You know, it's going to look like a regurgitation.  I don't think you're going to get enough for the beak.  It's going to look like the baby bird's choking on a cherry tomato.  That's what it's going to look like.  You're not going to be able to pull that up to look like the bulge of food is in the baby bird's throat.  You're going to not be able to get enough beak.  You know what's so great now?  If the cops stop you in front of a schoolyard, you can just say,  Hey, I'm doing impressions.  Very good.  I would not have thought of that.  Now, I wasn't looking close enough when they did the Loch Ness Monster. 
[02:24:00]  That looks like one that...  That's painful, too.  The Loch Ness Monster looked like a modified snail.  It looked like the snail, but they had made the neck longer  and kind of given it a little crook in the neck.  Yeah, anything that requires a clenched fist is going to be painful.  You've got to hold that stuff where it is in a fist.  And the windsurfer.  Now, I have talked about the bat.  The bat with two tumors in its wings.  You know that?  Where you stretch out and it looks like bat wings. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  Because it gets very thin, but then it's got the two tumors.  He had it.  That wing.  He was stretching it like a sail.  And it was stretched beyond any recognition whatsoever.  A couple of girls gagged at that point.  Yeah, they were freaking out.  You should not be...  You cannot do that.  That is not anatomically possible.  Well, just think if a girl all of a sudden pulled on stuff  and it looked like drapes or something. 
[02:25:00]  You'd be like, Hey, hey!  A little taken aback.  You have to really know what you're doing.  Yeah.  That would be lovely to watch.  Oh, man.  That was funny, though.  That is pretty funny.  That was all right.  So what else we got today?  Buy me.  I'm done.  Are we going to start bombing people?  No.  Are we going to start bouncing some rocks?  No.  Here's what I'm thinking.  We're not doing anything.  Anyone see the president's little press conference this morning?  When he said at 12.01... 
[02:25:30]  Oh, he gets everyone excited.  He goes, at 12.01 this morning, we started Operation Whatever They're Calling It Now  because the Muslims got pissed off at their original name.  Let me tell you something.  We've changed the name of it.  Operation Infinite Justice was the first one.  Here's what tells me we're doomed in this operation.  And it's not even going to happen the way we think it is.  I would love to see bombs.  I would love to see some...  It ain't going to happen.  They changed the name of Operation Infinite Justice because, for some reason, I still 
[02:26:00]  can't figure this out, it offended some Muslims.  So they changed the name.  Hey, bombing and killing them might offend them too.  But I think we ought to do that.  What's the new name?  I don't know.  They haven't come up with one yet.  Operation We Are Wimps?  Yeah.  How about Operation Cut That Out?  Operation Softie?  Yeah.  See, that I didn't like.  So he goes, at 12.01, we started Operation Whatever.  You get the butterflies like, oh, it started.  Okay.  I'm like, we bombed?  Wow.  I'm thinking, we're real good.  We bombed them already and no one knows and he's finally telling us. 
[02:26:30]  And he goes, and we started with the push of a pen.  Oh.  That's exactly what he said.  And you know what he did?  We have frozen their assets.  Ooh.  Ooh, wow.  Ooh, they've closed a bank account.  Woo!  Now they sent them a nasty letter.  It's war.  Let me tell you.  If that's the fact.  I've had war declared on me quite a few times for having.  To minimum, not having the minimum balance left.  Hey, because, you know.  I've had war declared on me 50 times.  I know people are going to trash us, but we understand.  GMAC declared war on me when they repoed my car. 
[02:27:00]  We understand that this is a complicated thing and we're going to have to freeze assets and  do this and do that and whatever.  But let's start with a little bombing just to get everyone nice and warmed up.  Bounce some rocks over there.  Bounce some rocks.  We should have the next day bombed something.  That's what they call it, Barry.  Bouncing rocks.  Bouncing some rocks.  Because it's such a disaster area to begin with.  I think what's going to be disappointing for a lot of us is much of it's going to be covert  and it's going to be going on.  People are going to be dying and people are going to be going into these caves and wiping  them out and then it won't be in the newspapers.  It'll just not be there anymore. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, you know something?  That's fine by me.  Something will leak out.  I know one thing.  We haven't bombed anything yet.  Yeah.  No, we haven't.  And we have more assets over there than you can imagine.  I want to see some things blowing up.  Let's start by making a statement.  Yeah.  Bounce some rocks.  We're kind of wimping out and I'm kind of thinking we're not going to do anything.  I've got faith in Colin Powell and I've got faith in all of them.  I really don't.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like to think so.  My favorite one over there.  Yes.  All right.  But let's get it going. 
[02:28:00]  Now, Greg, this isn't about retaliation.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  Do, do, do, do.  The slow music.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Right?  What would N.B. Davis do?  You've got to want, you've got to.  She would bake some brownies.  She'd bake some brownies for Osama bin Laden and hope that would solve the problem.  Right?  Yeah, with a bomb inside it or something.  Kill him with kindness.  Right.  She'd put something in there so it'd just internally explode.  I don't know.  It's not the nice Brady way. 
[02:28:30]  Should handle him that way.  How would Mike Brady explain this to Cindy?  You know, now we're going to war, Cindy.  Going to war and it's those dirty towel heads, Cindy,  that did this to us.  They blew up the Dittmeyer's house.  You know, they have to have it in this low scale,  Brady life kind of smaller scale thing.  They've invaded Fillmore Junior High.  Now, he told, didn't he tell Peter to go back and hit Buddy,  Buddy Hinton in the front of the nose?  Yeah, it's, Cindy, it's like the time Buddy Hinton said, 
[02:29:00]  baby talk, baby talk, it's a wonder you can walk.  Go nail him.  And, yeah, Peter knew he had to do something,  so he walked over and punched him in the nose.  And what happened?  Buddy Hinton stopped making fun of Cindy.  Let's take a lesson from the Bradys and punch Buddy Hinton in the face.  But also remember what happens when you think you hear something.  You run into a room yelling, where's my surprise party?  And there isn't one.  We need to put itching powder down the backs of all the girls at the sleepover.  Got to get rid of them. 
[02:29:30]  That's what we've got to do, right?  Love that episode.  That's what we have to do.  Loved it.  We have to show up at the party with the big wig.  That's what we've got to do, the new Jan Brady.  You know, Anthony, I know we broadcast in many cities.  Yeah.  So we've got to explain this a little bit so everyone can enjoy the beating  that Mike and the Mad Dog took here in New York.  Mike and the Mad Dog, they work on an all-sports station here in New York.  They were the kings of afternoon radio.  Yeah.  Until a couple guys came along and just destroyed them. 
[02:30:00]  Who were those guys?  That would be us.  And we'll say it every single time because these guys were dirtbags to us.  That one day.  They made fun of us when we were trying to do something different with the XFL  and things like that.  And we just completely destroy them in the ratings.  And that should be said.  One day, a new guy came to town and a new show came to town and kicked their ass.  You know who that was?  Mitch Kumpstein, my roommate.  Yeah.  So, Danny. 
[02:30:30]  You want to explain Mike and the Mad Dog to the other cities?  You probably have a show like this in your city.  It's sports talk.  Right.  You know, they go on in the afternoon.  Well, one guy is really, really pompous and thinks he knows it all.  And the other guy has a really bad lisp.  Yeah.  It's kind of a little speech impediment.  That's kind of funny to listen to.  He has a lot of energy.  He's like the little firecracker.  He does live reads for Toyota.  And the other guy, yeah, is like a very droning kind of likes to think he knows everything kind of guy.  That bloated bore. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  There you go.  Or you could put it that way, Norton.  Right.  And now, just like anything else, like any other radio show, you've probably got a couple of these guys.  It's like the ESPN radio that's hitting a lot of cities now.  So, in the midst of this tragedy, they all of a sudden switch gears and become experts.  Yeah.  We never claim to be experts.  When we get on this show and we talk the last two weeks about this, it's just like our dopey selves are talking about it to our friends.  We know.  We're not educated.  We don't know. 
[02:31:30]  We're just talking.  And these guys kind of were trying to come off like they could switch gears from, you know, basketball, football, baseball.  All of a sudden, now, they're talking foreign policy with the same.  Yeah.  So, they went from talking about the Mets and the Yankees and the Jets and the Giants to being experts on the Middle East and terrorism.  Experts on terrorism, Maggie.  So, Phil Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick.  Phil who?  Who, you know, I got to give him props.  He doesn't really like our show.  It's all right.  But Martin's average. 
[02:32:00]  Guy's average.  He's not really a standout terrorist.  I don't even think the guy's got a good arm, Maggie.  He wrote an article over the weekend.  I think he's going to be in trouble when it comes to the playoffs.  In the post called Drive Time Dribble.  Drive Time Dribble.  Dribble.  It says Mike and the Mad Dog exposed as frauds.  Frauds?  Nice.  Frauds.  I wish I could say that word, Maggie.  This is a great article.  Mike and the Mad Dog, on the other hand, have stayed in character.  Oh, they're talking about how other shows, you know, like, like, wait, we don't really claim to know what we're talking about. 
[02:32:30]  But we're trying, you know.  But they stayed in character.  And nothing is beyond their wisdom and their self-importance.  They're all-seeing, all-knowing.  Now, let me just state this for the record.  Phil Mushnick is a prick.  Oh, of course.  I don't like this guy at all, either.  So it's not like we're buddying up with Mushnick.  No, I give him props, though, because this article had me giggling like a schoolgirl all weekend.  And over the course of the last 11 days, armed with faint notions, they have again sustained their status as pompous blowhards. 
[02:33:00]  That's great.  Now, he talks about Mad Dog here.  Mad Dog?  Although Mad Dog might need two chances to tell you when the War of 1812 was fought.  Everyone knows it's 1815.  1809?  When the hell was it?  This is exactly how he sounds on the radio for the end of the year.  Now, his words from Toro Roeder.  Toro Roeder.  Toro, Toro Ro...  Toro Loan Mower.  I don't care.  I'll switch the sponsor. 
[02:33:30]  So it says, although Mad Dog might need two chances to tell you when the War of 1812 was fought,  by last week, he'd become a 50,000-watt scholar on Middle Eastern affairs.  At one point, he declared it will take one or two years to get bin Laden.  I think it's going to take one or two years because they're the American team, a very young team.  I think they need a building and have their coach.  It's going to take one or two years, just like, you know, you can't build up a young team  and expect them to make the championship in one year.  It's going to take a couple of seasons for this young U.S. Army to get this guy. 
[02:34:00]  And then Phil goes on to say, Mad Dog didn't provide any foundation for his timetable.  I can't. I'm a blowhard.  But it was likely gleaned from his daily briefings with the State Department, the CIA, Interpol, and Dusty Baker.  I just had a briefing with the CIA.  They're trying to use my speech as some kind of uninterpretable code.  It seems the enemy can't hear what I'm saying. 
[02:34:30]  Neither can the Americans.  So, Mad Dog, when are we going to start bouncing some rocks over there?  You seem to be the expert.  I don't know.  You know, some of these ships got good arms on them,  and I think they can lock these bombs in pretty good.  They've got to put the radar gun on them.  I think it's better than the Clemens Festival.  Why don't we just get Roger Rocket Clemens to throw some hand grenades.  The guy's got a good arm.  I can see how the American army can use them.  Very viable bop set. 
[02:35:00]  That's it.  That is work from Taramrana.  Taramrana.  Let me go to Justin.  Justin, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you today?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah, yeah.  I think the...  The overrun is about three years on this war,  and I think you take the under on this.  No problem.  Oh, you got it.  What do you think that might be?  The guy you're talking about, nationally, everybody knows who Mike is.  It's Mike Francesa. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  The guy's on CBS Sports.  I'm in New York.  I know him.  But I mean, everybody across the country knows this blowhard.  He's on MSNBC, and I think he's got his own show on Sundays,  and CBS has him during college basketball and all that.  And the guy is just...  I mean, he knows everything, just that.  It was a great article in the paper, because, you know,  you shouldn't claim to know what's going on completely.  When someone calls, hey, guys, first time, long time, welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  My favorite is ditto.  I like the ditto. 
[02:36:00]  They're talking about bringing back the draft.  What kind of draft?  I don't think any teams are picking right now.  We're heading into the championship.  What kind of draft are they talking about?  All right.  Well, we just touched on that.  The other cities are like, huh?  I like to talk about the 100-year war, Mikey.  I think that lasted about 20, 30 years.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  Yeah, listen.  On September 11th, the day that it actually happened, 
[02:36:30]  you had to hear the two of them going on.  You thought that doggy was talking about a football game  between the Jets and the Patriots going about how,  yeah, we've got to go in there and get a win.  We can't get a tie.  You know, it's very important.  Our offense is going to be very good.  We're going to go in there.  You know, the Russians came out with only a draw.  The Russians went into Afghanistan and came out with a tie.  You know, we can't do that.  There's no sudden death to overtime in this.  You must have used the word full-court press about 300 times that afternoon.  Really?  You need to put on a full-court press. 
[02:37:00]  You think he's going to, like, get the refrigerator Perry and send them in there?  Classic.  Well, you know, the terrorists, they went in, they scored early,  and it's up to us now to come back and put some points on the board.  It's like a goddamn ball game.  That's all I know.  I'm a robot.  Yabba-dabba-doo.  Yabba-dabba-doo.  That guy's classic.  That is funny, though.  That's classic. 
[02:37:30]  Talking about Theo Moore like it's a game.  Hey, we're getting a lot of requests for Angry Young Earl.  You want to play that again as we go to break?  They're bringing out the chain.  Did the ten of us get a first down?  This is the kind of thing that makes you happy,  the Colin Powell and Dick Cheney, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This could be my kind of head.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got a question for the dog.  All right, he's here.  Good afternoon, everybody.  You're on the air, Joe.  First time, long time.  Thank you, though.  What's the best way to retaliate while conserving foreign interest? 
[02:38:00]  The best way to retaliate while what?  Conserving foreign interest.  I don't think we got away with our foreign interest.  I think we got to get in there and score a couple of points  and put something on the scoreboard, even if it's a field goal.  You know?  They obviously scored a touchdown.  But, you know, we chip away a couple of field goals here and there.  We're going to come away winner.  Parcells needs to be aggressive.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, the other day I was listening, he was doing an ad for Gorilla Glue. 
[02:38:30]  Wait, wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Gorilla Glue.  Hold on.  Too many guys saying the other day I was listening.  Do you listen to us?  No, I listen to you guys, but I'm saying the other day he was doing an ad for Gorilla Glue.  He could barely get the words out of his mouth.  Gorilla Glue.  Gorilla Glue.  Gorilla Glue.  Gorilla Glue.  Simmy and sticky stuff.  Let me go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  First time in a long time.  Hey. 
[02:39:00]  Mech, mech.  Thank you, Paul.  You're about to have.  Listen, I want to know what kind of role Andre Agassi is going to play in this war.  I think he'd be a great asset to the American Army.  I think when they throw hand grenades at us, he could just lob him right back.  And what about Barry Bonds?  Do you think Barry Bonds is going to do anything over there?  I think he'll do pretty good.  I think, again, the hand grenades come over, he could slam him right back at him.  Pretty far, too.  And, Mike, you have any opinion on Andre Agassi?  Uh, no. 
[02:39:30]  Later, guys.  All right, Paul.  Opinions like a-holes.  Everyone's got one.  Let's take a break, and we'll wrap it up with Barry Williams next.  Do we have time to play Angry Young Earl or no?  Sure.  Actually, I'm going to have to bail.  I've got to get back and get ready, because I'm going to see the show tonight.  You're going to the penis puppet show.  Not that show.  Of course.  He's really, he's made all, these two, the penis puppet guys have made everybody proud,  haven't they?  Because, you know, we are all works of art. 
[02:40:00]  Right.  There you go.  Just waiting to be manipulated.  That's what I'm trying to tell everybody, Mike.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I can't believe he's leaving.  I've got to be at 7 o'clock or I'm dead.  Weren't you having fun with us today?  I'm having a great, I'm with your kid.  I thought we'd, like, hang and stuff.  I thought we got to that part in our relationship where we'd almost say, hey, Barry, let's get  a beer.  It was a good show.  Well, I was just going to say, come on, have a beer.  I've got a couple of people coming over.  We're going to have a little bit of a, you know, the weakest link party.  The weakest link with the Brady's all on the weakest link. 
[02:40:30]  Come over, hang out.  Are you trying to say we could stop by your pad?  Absolutely.  Hang in just to meet you.  Got a little party.  Is it up in the attic?  That would be cool.  Wouldn't that be cool if he lived up in the attic and you had to walk through the beads to get  into his room and it was all groovy and stuff?  Carol, Mike?  Mike, Carol.  I actually like the room you made out of your father's office there behind the fireplace there.  It was perfect.  In his office.  That was great because he had all the lights and then you were such a loser.  You had no friends hang out with me. 
[02:41:00]  But I did have the headband, man.  And I was the first white guy with an afro.  Yes, you were.  Absolutely.  Can you make the ghost noise or...  No, I got that here.  That's the UFO noise.  I'm scared.  I got the thing.  The ghost noise was lower.  You are so sick.  UFO. 
[02:41:30]  There you go.  You are so sick.  You have this right here.  I love it.  My life was the Brady Bunch.  Please.  I'm going to have to dig out that tiki and bring it back.  Yeah.  Gee, that would be great.  All right, Barry.  If you got to go, you got to go.  I got to go.  I got to go.  I can't stay.  I'll be pulling this on all the guests.  It was fun for a while.  Yeah.  For a while.  You know, next time we will more than make up for what you saw today.  Okay, we're going to go back the other direction. 
[02:42:00]  The other direction.  Bring the women back.  It's been way too long.  You got to come back soon.  I'm here.  I've been working on the series.  And I'm back.  All right.  Barry Williams on the weakest link tonight.  It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun tonight.  Watch Oliver get thrown off.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  You suck.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  Hey, Anthony, O2Go.  Hey, what's a great gas?  Oxygen.  Oxygen. 
[02:42:30]  Very good.  Oxygen.  Would you say it's necessary?  It seems to be.  It's a pretty important gas.  You know, O2Go has oxygen in the water more than any other water.  Yeah.  Up to eight times more oxygen.  It's distilled water, so it's healthy.  And then it's oxygenated, so it tastes crisp and clean.  Mmm.  And it helps you stay alert.  And it does great things for your brain with the oxygen in it. 
[02:43:00]  It's got oxygen in it.  That's right.  Not even nature can make it this pure.  It's so pure.  Mmm.  Look for O2Go.  Original blue.  Delicious, calorie-free.  Essence flavors.  Or exclusive black sports bottle with even more oxygen in it.  The coffee replacement.  You want to perk up without caffeine?  Here it is.  It's O2Go.  Oxygenated water.  O2Go.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:43:30]  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the O&A Show.  I think we have time to play a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A Show and end  with Angry Young Earl, just in case you missed it earlier.  Yeah.  Jim Norton, thanks for stopping by.  Got to tell everyone, you're in Penthouse.  And I think it comes out tomorrow.  I don't know when.  I think it's the November issue.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  People saying it comes out tomorrow.  Oh, does it?  I don't even know.  An interview with our own Jim Norton.  That should be really cool. 
[02:44:00]  So I want to remind people of that.  And I guess we can go right to what did we learn?  Hey, Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned three things today.  I learned that Nicole has a 1970s Earth Mama Bush.  Yeah.  I learned that having Greg Brady with you while you look at penises makes it less gay.  I learned that the kids that Norton hugs in the mall were asking for it.  Norton rules.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Cool.  Let's go to Woodsy.  Woodsy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I learned a couple of things, too. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  I learned that O&A like looking at man junk.  Easy.  Rick's still a fag.  And another word for bombing is dropping rocks.  Making rocks bounce.  Same thing.  All right, cool.  Thank you, bro.  Kevin, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Clint Eastwood has bologna boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I learned that penis puppets outside of a schoolyard is not an offense.  It's called impressions.  Thanks, Kevin.  Jay, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned Oliver is the weakest link in his TV career and in life. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And I learned, according to most people, I mean, according to Anthony, most people would spell  Kirby with a U.  And Norton never saw a sailboat leak.  I'll never tell.  I'll never tell.  Keith.  Creeps me out every time.  Kat, what's going on?  Kat.  Hey.  You're on the radio.  Yeah, I learned today that an Achille Laura reference is always welcome and appropriate.  Yeah.  And that Norton is my god.  Oh, good.  You guys are awesome.  Bye.  Thanks, Kat.  Nice.  Doug, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:45:30]  Well, actually, I learned a couple of things.  All right.  I also learned that Greg actually broke Marcia's nose doing penis tricks with it.  And the second thing I also learned, I learned that he actually is schizophrenic because he  doesn't know who he is, if he's Bobby, Greg, or Johnny Bravo.  Very good.  Right.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Jesus.  We're still trying to get back to normal, Ann.  I was hoping he pulled out of that one, but he, oh, my God. 
[02:46:00]  He plowed through like a trooper.  Oh, my goodness.  Brian, I learned that clowns at birthday parties don't have to waste their time making  stupid balloon animals anymore as long as they have their junk in place.  Biscuit head.  I learned Opie giggles like a schoolgirl.  Greg Brady was the first white guy with an afro.  Don't wear tiki dolls.  Bad luck.  We need to bounce some rocks.  I also learned Oliver is the reason the Brady Bunch got canceled.  Sometimes you have to punch the bully in the nose.  And Mike and the Mad Dog are experts in Middle East affairs.  Very good. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, if we're going to end with Angry Young Earl, we've got to play it now, Anthony.  All right.  Let's do that.  You want to explain this really fast?  Yeah.  We've had a lot of clips over this, especially the past couple of weeks, of Earl just getting  pissed off.  So, Billy Joel's Angry Young Man seemed to be a good backup song to clips of Earl being  pissed.  Just like the tribute songs that are being played lately.  You know, a lot of the music and the news clips over it.  Yeah.  We have Angry Young Man by Billy Joel with Angry Earl clips over it.  Yeah.  We really like this.  And as we leave it today, we've got a couple pairs of tickets to the Pledge of Allegiance 
[02:47:00]  tour featuring Slipknot, System of a Down, Ramstein, or Ramstein, Mudvayne, and American  Head charge at the Continental Arena on October 31st in Jersey.  It's a Halloween show.  A few tickets still available through Ticketmaster Outlets.  We've got a couple pairs right now at 877-692-1027.  With that, we leave you with Angry Young Earl.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Why don't we get Black Earl in here and see why he's so upset?  I think we all know, but it's always fun when he tries to explain himself. 
[02:47:30]  He's got some rage.  T-minus 10 seconds before Earl leaves his death in mind.  Oh, here comes Earl.  Earl, don't.  Earl.  Mark, go f*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  What the hell is that?  Go f*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  Come and get it.  Does the three letters FBI mean anything to you?  We'll let Trump go and broil. 
[02:48:00]  Meet you people, eh?  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  What's the problem?  Ask Earl, what's the problem?  What's the problem, Earl?  Why are you angry?  Well, I'm just a little irritated, that's all.  So when I get irritated, I can leave the situation.  Why did he slam the door?  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  I got that.  Does Earl realize how gay he sounds right now?  Right.  Kiss my ass.  Did the invisible man follow you out, Earl?  Here he is. 
[02:48:30]  That's what he's throwing on.  He gives me nothing to go with and then yells at me for not knowing.  Says her.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  No violence in this office.  No violence in this office.  Oh, Lordy, no.  He's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  You calling me mental?  You calling me mental?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Earl, comment.  Guess what?  No one cares.  I'm famous even though I'm not.  Who the F are you?  Gin soaked, cocaine filled brain. 
[02:49:00]  We're trying to, first of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to be down there.  We had no business being down there.  Just saying, I'm an idiot and I'm stupid.  The place in the world for the angry young man  With his working class ties and his radical plan  He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl  And he's always at home with his back to the wall  And he's proud of the scars and the battles he's fought  And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross 
[02:49:30]  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  He's got all these laminates.  He's like the Pope.  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminates?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminates.  Earl, come in.  Yeah.  Moment or two to the angry young man  With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  He's been stabbed in the back, keeping misunderstood  It's a comfort to know his attention's a good  And he sits in a room with a lock on the door  With his mouth and his hand up laid out on the floor  And he likes to be known as the angry young man 
[02:50:00]  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  Well, the mic was drooping down.  It would have slammed down on the board.  That's why I was holding the microphone.  Past the age, consciousness and conscious rage, I found that just surviving was a noble fight.  You ass!  I once believed in causes too, I had my pointless point of view, and life but I know now who was wrong or right.  Guess what, no one cares.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  There's always a place for the angry young man, with his fist in the air and his head in the sand. 
[02:50:30]  And he's never been able to learn from a snake, so he can't understand why his heart always breaks.  And his honor is pure and his courage is wealth, and he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell.  And I'll go to the grave as an angel.  The figure of speech.  What about the figure of speech?  Use that mask between your ears called your brain every once in a while.  You would know what that means.  You don't get it.  It's a federal disaster area.  This, this, this isn't a...  Whoa! 
[02:51:00]  Earl, calm down!  Earl, comment.  I'm the public service director.  Earl, Earl.  Earl, Earl.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  You.  This isn't a...  He's over the place of the angry young man, with his working class ties and his radical plans.  He refuses to bend, he refuses to call.  And he's always at home with his back to the wall.  And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost.  And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross.  And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, how can a guy with no motion be in promotion?  I don't know!  I don't know!  I don't know!  I'm the public service director.  I'm famous, even though I'm not.  Who the ass?  Stay away from him, Mark, because I guarantee you someone will get injured.  Hey, Earl, Earl, any final words?  Who the F are you?  You...  Ass!  Tell me where I'm going!  Whoa!  Earl, calm down!  You calling me mental...  Scoot it!  Gin-so-cocaine-filled brain.  Scoot it!  Ass!  Again, something you know nothing about. 
[02:52:00]  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot and I'm stupid.  Scoot it!  Ass!  That's why I brought the theater down!  Scoot it!  Go f*** yourself, okay?  There he is.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We look forward to your next one, Carl.  With great anticipation.  That's right.  Now, don't stop it.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.
