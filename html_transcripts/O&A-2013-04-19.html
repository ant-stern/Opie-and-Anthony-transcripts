<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered the unfolding Boston Marathon bombing extensively, focusing heavily on the manhunt for the suspects.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with their regular in-studio team – including Jimmy "Tranny," Sam Roberts, Nicole (the producer), and a recurring character known as "The Cuban" – provided a running commentary interspersed with vulgar jokes and speculation.  Their information sources included police scanners, social media, and snippets of news reports and press conferences.  Early in the broadcast, they discussed the unfolding events based on initial reports, focusing on the emerging names of suspects, including the initially-misidentified Sunil Tripathi. The hosts’ commentary often included crude humor, pop culture references, and speculation.  The broadcast then shifted to live updates on the manhunt, detailing the suspects’ actions (carjacking, throwing explosives, a shootout in Watertown) and the eventual apprehension (or what appeared to be the apprehension) of one suspect.  The suspects were later identified as brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, legal permanent residents of the US.

A significant portion of the broadcast detailed the manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, utilizing live police scanner chatter and breaking news reports.  The hosts discussed information found on a Russian social network about the suspect, speculating about his motives.  A Watertown caller provided a firsthand account of the lockdown, while the hosts compared the situation to a video game like "Grand Theft Auto."  They also discussed the suspect's scholarship, the reactions of local residents, and media coverage, even mentioning the absence of a staff member. The segment included a live read for GoToMeeting.com and a humorous advertisement for an Elvis impersonator, along with snippets of news coverage and the President’s address.  Discussions also briefly touched upon the presidential campaign and the hosts' personal experiences.  Nicole's apparent hangover and limp, her Miami trip, and her large feet provided recurring comedic fodder.


The broadcast further included a significant amount of police scanner audio, highlighting the intense and chaotic nature of the manhunt. The hosts mocked mainstream news coverage, comparing it unfavorably to their own access to information.  A call from a high school classmate of one of the suspects was briefly included.  A particularly graphic eyewitness account came from "Mike in Watertown," detailing the shootout, the suspect being run over by his brother, multiple gun battles, explosions (including grenades), significant blood, property damage, and his claim of seeing the suspect's body.  The hosts' commentary throughout remained heavily laced with crude humor and speculation, often contrasting the information they received with mainstream media reports.


A humorous segment featured a "grilled cheese truck" vendor delivering sandwiches to the studio.  This was followed by Ronnie from *Jersey Shore* joining the show, along with his wife Nicole.  The conversation then shifted to Ronnie’s time on *Jersey Shore*, his acting pursuits, Snooki's pregnancy and perceived manipulative behavior, and Jamie Foxx’s acting abilities.  Ronnie also promoted his new line of pre-mixed cocktails, "Smush Cocktails," while discussing his tumultuous relationship with his wife. The conversation involved crude jokes, personal attacks, and cynical commentary about marriage and relationships.  Throughout all these segments, updates on the ongoing manhunt continued to be interspersed.  The hosts consistently expressed frustration with the conflicting and inaccurate information reported by news outlets, comparing it to their own quicker access to information through online sources and social media, even drawing a parallel to a *Sopranos* plotline. The show concluded with continuing discussion of the manhunt and its developments, along with Ronnie’s cocktail promotion.

[00:02:30]  Ho hum, yawn, what a boring day  This is turning out to be  It's a fucking action movie happening right now in Watertown  Crappiness  I wanna start by  I stayed up as late as I could last night  Cause I said to myself  As soon as the FBI released those two  Those photos and those videos  Yeah  I'm like, it's not like the old days  Where they have to put that shit on  You know, telephone poles and light poles and all that shit 
[00:03:00]  Yeah  You know, they go  Well, if you've seen these individuals  You know, please give us a call  I'm like, see these individuals  As soon as they pop those pictures up  I mean, the social media was gonna go nuts  Yep  And I knew it was moving incredibly fast  Yeah  And then I went to bed thinking  Alright, well  I guess everyone is gonna hunker down for the night  Hunker  And I leave my building  And Chris picked me up this morning  And he goes  A lot happening in Boston  And I'm like, what do you mean?  And then he gave me the rundown 
[00:03:30]  But I guess you stayed up for a little bit of it  Or most of it?  Yeah  I was up listening to the Boston police scanners  Right  And holy fuck  Big shootout  Reports of grenades or some type of explosives  Being lobbed at the police  One MIT University police officer's dead  He was shot to death in his own car  Just sitting there  Well, he had nothing to do with this?  He just happened to be in the wrong place?  Wrong place, wrong time 
[00:04:00]  And the guys shot him  Two bombers  So how did this begin?  Of course we're talking about the Boston bombing suspects  As we know it, one is dead  And one is hunkered down somewhere in Watertown  On the loose, perhaps  In Watertown  They're really  They've got a tight perimeter around there  About 15  The equivalent of 15 blocks  Right  Of perimeter  Right  Just trying to get this guy  And they're pretty confident he's within that area right now?  From what I'm hearing 
[00:04:30]  No, they don't know if he's there or not right now  Wow  Listening to the scanners  Alright, so how did this unfold last night?  Well, I reckon somewhere around 10, 10.30  The MIT police officer was shot?  The MIT cop was shot  In the head and killed by the suspects  Yeah  They then took his car  Oh, so they were basically looking for a car  They basically knew that the officials were closing in on him  Yeah  Okay  They went to a 7-Eleven  Where the security camera got a pretty good picture of 
[00:05:00]  Suspect number two, as he's been known  Who I am calling Sunil Tripathi  Right  Sunil Tripathi  A lot of people were making that connection last night  Yeah, there was a Facebook page dedicated to a missing person  This guy's been missing for a while  And that Facebook page is subsequently  Is it gone?  Yeah 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that page is gone  Okay  There are reports that the FBI has been looking  Not only for this guy, but into this guy for a while  And I'm officially stating  For the Opie and Anthony show  That this is the guy  You're saying it  I'm confirming it right now  Sunil Tripathi  He's from  22 years old  He's from Providence, Rhode Island  He was a student at Brown  And then he took a leave of absence  Took a leave of absence  Where there's speculation  That he could have gone overseas for training 
[00:06:00]  Is what I heard on the news this morning  But who knows  Right  We're not a news agency  So we can say whatever the fuck we want  Wow  So could John King  Exactly  So could CNN  Fox News  All of them  So I might as well get in on it  Uh oh  Travis with an update  Yes  Scanner reports from 30 seconds ago  Is they have him in custody  What?

[00:11:00]  No I'm not really hearing anything  Hmm  But Twitter  Pertaining to  But Twitter  It's like hundreds of tweets a second  And they've been  I mean  Maybe they just stopped saying it  Twitter and Reddit and Facebook 
[00:11:30]  And the rest of them have been way ahead of this shit  It's really um  Way ahead of this shit  Quite fucking  They were talking about Sunil uh  Is that how you say his name?  Yeah  I mean  Really early on yesterday  Yeah  Yeah  And now the news is sort of going with it a little bit  A little bit  Um  There's a picture of him  Boy that nose  The eyes  The way the eyes are set  It really kind of looks like  That guy  Right  The one that's still out there  Suspect number two 
[00:12:00]  Yeah  The one with the white hat  So  It's unfolding in front of our eyes  Yeah  So  So  So the 7-11  They get a good shot of him on the cameras  Yeah  And then they grabbed a guy and his vehicle  They carjacked a Mercedes  Carjacked a Mercedes  Went to Watertown  Mm-hmm  And uh  Let the guy go  At a gas station  Pretty amazing right there  They had him for about 30 minutes  Kidnapped in the car I guess  Like why'd they let him go?  Right  I don't know  Um 
[00:12:30]  But indeed they did  And uh  That's when this big shootout happened  Well before that  At various points the suspects  Started throwing explosives  Out the window of the car  Yeah  This is like some GTA shit  Going down live  Exactly  Uh  Now  Suspect number one  You know  With the black hat  Was uh  Brought to the hospital  With uh  Multiple gunshot wounds  And uh  Explosive trauma  To his body  Including like  Blast and shrapnel  Um 
[00:13:00]  There are reports of another  Uh  A pressure cooker bomb  Really?  Yeah  And uh  He had uh  Wounds on him  Shrapnel wounds  And he was ripped up  Pretty good  And uh  He died at the hospital  So who knows  Did it inadvertently go off?  Did he uh  Commit suicide that way?  Um  Or who knows  Or hopefully  One of uh  Boston's finest  Said oh yeah  Yeah  Landed a nice round  Right into the fucking thing  Hold this pressure cooker  That would be a little um  No kidding  I know 
[00:13:30]  A little rough  Yeah  Uh  So  I guess  They're  They're  They're concerned also  About more bombs  You know  If these guys had another  Pressure cooker bomb  Who knows  If they were going to  Plant it somewhere  If they have planted  Other ones  Right  In places  So they're pretty uh  Being pretty cautious  About that  Well just to go back  When the gunfight went down  A witness says  One of the shooters  Ran toward the officers  While the other got  In the Mercedes SUV  And then  I guess it would be  Suspect number two  Just drove through the  The police line  At the end of the street  And that's how he got away 
[00:14:00]  Yeah  As the other one  Was in that whole  Shootout  Right  Uh  An MBTA  Transit officer  Was shot  In the water town  And he's in serious condition  Yeah  And then they shot  Another guy  Yeah  Uh  Yeah  So they're worried  About more explosives  Yup  You said the pressure cooker thing  Uh  Let's see  Craziness  It's just insanity  Wow  It is  It's like action movie  Yeah  Turn that scanner back on  See if we got anything new  Yeah

[00:30:00]  And it  Oh really  Gunshots aren't  Important  Natural environment  I'm missing out  You're stuck indefinitely  In your apartment  You don't feel  Particularly safe  Like our  You know  What a town  The other thing  I was telling Anthony  Before the show  It sucks that they  You know  The first suspect  Is dead  Because that's going to  Play right into  Alex Jones  And Info Wars  And prison  Planet  Of course  He's dead  They killed the Patsy  Again  They've killed the Patsy  Is what they do  In these 
[00:30:30]  False flag situations  You know  Eliminate the Patsy  If you remember  Jack Ruby  Shooting Lee Harvey Oswald  After the  The assassination  Of JFK  This is textbook  Textbook  Textbook  This is a textbook  Elimination of Patsy  Baba Booey  Baba Booey  Howard Stern's penis  Baba Booey  Patsy  That's Patsy  That fucking guy  Yesterday on the news  Was so annoying  Info Wars  Oh god 
[00:31:00]  Yeah it was terrible  And we confuse people  When we talk about Alex Jones  We love him  We hate him  I love him  We want to hug him  We want to punch him  I don't know what the fuck  To do with the guy  He's hilarious  But as soon as I heard  That her suspect  Was killed  I'm like  No  He's going to go  He's going to go off  They always kill the Patsy  Well obviously  This is a textbook  If you think about  The Gulf of Tonkin incident  Right  Again another false flag 
[00:31:30]  He just throws that shit out there  Oh my god  The conspiracy people  Will love the fact  That the suspect is dead  Right  Right  And especially if they  Kill the second one  Right  Does Alex Jones  Have a video up yet?  What is he doing?  He's got an InfoWars logo now  He has a seal behind him  I love it  He does  It looks more and more  Like Scientology  When was this posted?  I just clicked the live stream  I think this is live  Oh  And just as we support  Your liberty 
[00:32:00]  You support our liberty  We're together  Who was it that said  One of the founders  Was it Benjamin Franklin  We'll hang together  Or hang separate  We will surely hang together  Or hang separate  Benjamin Franklin  We also love French pusses  In an honorable code  Of liberty  And just as my father  Had a father and a mother  And they had a father and a mother  There is that genetic hand  Hand to hand  Right back to our ancestors  We are just a few steps away  From the founders of this country  Just as people that come after us  Will be a few steps away from us  This is history happening 
[00:32:30]  Is it live or is it?  This is a fight  I don't think it's live  We came  Yeah  I bet they're just streaming  No he'd be out of his fucking mind  Oh he would be  Patsy  Uh  Uh  There it is  Obviously  You know I called this one  Look it up  File number 8359  Ha ha ha  He always throws some reading at you  You're like  What?  Wait  Where do I go for this?  Where do I find file 83195  Nine of the fucking  Slash B

[00:33:30]  Will fucking attack us now  For just having a little fun with this  Oh we love them  Stop  There goes my mic  What's going on?  Looks like they're on Arsenal  You with that location?

[00:34:30]  Yeah the AP's reporting a name for the alive one  And it's not Sunil  Oh it's not the AP  What are they saying it is?  Just go to our  Just go to Twitter slash AP  I can't even pronounce the name  He's a 19 year old  He's a 19 year old?  Jesus Christ  It's a surviving suspect identified as 
[00:35:00]  D-Z-H-O-K-H-A-R  That's Russian  Last name T-S-A-R-N-A-E-V  19 of Cambridge  Of Cambridge, Massachusetts  Yeah bomb suspects from Russia  From Russian region near Chechnya  Lived in U.S. for at least a year  Chechnyans could be um  Muslim right?  I don't think anyone can be Muslim  Well you know what I mean  You mean Middle Eastern  Well no 
[00:35:30]  I mean Muslim  You know what I mean  Anyone can be Muslim  Yeah but if you turned Muslim  You know  Then I'm Muslim  I don't think you're gonna  Well you know  Those Chechnyans  Yeah  What the fuck is the connection here  Chechnyans are Muslims  Chechnyans  And they've been known for some  Way crazy shenanigans  Yeah  Badass shit  Yeah they were the villains  In 24 one season  Were they?  Were they really?  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  So and so  I think people  We'll try and get this guy on the phone  We'll uh  Oh shut up 
[00:36:00]  What happened?  Ah  Jess is a muzzy on here  And she's getting all pissy about Muslims  A muzzy?  Lay down  Stay in bed  Well you know  There are some nice Muslims out there  Ah  So the APA is conflicting Europe  Uh yeah  I'll have to retract  Okay  My previous statement  Okay so you're calling off  The manhunt  So if you run into  Yeah  Sunil  Do not shoot him 
[00:36:30]  Uh yeah  Oh my god  Yeah you kind of said that  If you were uh  If you heard my earlier  Oh my god  To shoot this gentleman  Stand down  Just don't acknowledge that anymore  Please do not  Stand down  Stand down  Stand down  Yeah  Holy fuck man  There's some fucking  There's some great Twitter shit  But Anthony Cumia told me to  Uh what happened?  Anthony told me  Hey  Hey wait a minute  Stinky kind of looks like the guy  Look he looks a little like Stinky  And they say 
[00:37:00]  If you see something  Say something  Yeah  Are they tackling?  Well I think you should tackle him  Okay  I'm calling for people to shoot Stinky  On site  If you see awesome Garrett  I saw the terrorist  Yeah  Do you got a forecast for Watertown?  Uh  Heavy rain of bullets  Coming down  A shrapnel front is moving in  You think he'll get out of Watertown? 
[00:37:30]  Never  Never  Never  Maybe in a body bag  Yes  Uh uh  People of Watertown  Go about your business  Nothing to see here  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  You're saying they're uh  What?  Brothers  Who?  Sunil?  The two  No  Sunil is no longer involved  These two guys are brothers  The two suspects are apparently brothers  Comrades or brothers?  I can't get anything going with my brothers 
[00:38:00]  Nothing right?  Look at these guys  What the fuck?  I know I'm trying to get a rock good rehearsal together with my brother  We can't even fucking get that  We can't get in the same place ever  Jesus  We always try to make plans  But fuck it  Something's always going on  Wow  I guess they're saying they're brothers  And they're legal  Permanent residents  What?  They're legal permanent residents  Yeah  Not like  What does that mean?  They're not like here on a work visa  They're not like illegal  Yeah but where do they come from?  Uh  Chechnya  Chechnya  Yeah  I don't want to hear one  Alright  Chechnyans are Muslims 
[00:38:30]  Uh  I don't know  These are more Muslim terrorists  I'm calling it right now  I just watched a Pine Barren's episode of Sopranos last night  Oh yeah  Czechoslovakian  He's a interior decorator  Czechoslovakian  His apartment looked like shit  Fucking  Meanwhile it's Chechnyan  He calls him Czechoslovakian  Fucking brothers  Yeah  What's their problem with America?  They're Muslims  Muslims don't like this shit 
[00:39:00]  They don't like Americans  They haven't been involved in American shit  Let's go to this again  Williams to release further information about their names and their backgrounds  Mike I don't want to interrupt you but we do have Pete Williams you mentioned him  Let's bring him in now with some more information on these two guys  Pete what can you tell us?  Well we have the names although there's an ambiguity about the spelling of the last name here 
[00:39:30]  That we're trying to resolve  But we're told that they're brothers  One is 19 and one is 20  We beat that to this shit  The one who is at large now  The person identified by the FBI last night in the news conference  As the person wearing the white hat  The person who was suspected of planting the bomb  The second bomb that went off  13 seconds after the first  Is a Cambridge, Massachusetts resident  That they're both legal permanent residents of the U.S.  Came here  Been here within the past year 
[00:40:00]  His first name  This is the man with the white hat  Is Jokar  D-Z-H-O-K-A-R  How does that spell Jokar?  Jokar  And his last name is  T-S-A-R-N-A-E  And then the last name  And we've heard two different versions of this  Is Z or V  We were told Z by two sources  But we see that the AP has the last letter being the letter V  And I don't know if this is a result of people mishearing that last letter or not  But that's their last name 
[00:40:30]  And they are brothers  Spell the last name again if you could, Pete  Oh, boy  Shut up  You lost us  We're not paying attention  We're moving on to the next news organization  The Watertown community has always stood strong  We need them to do this today  I want to be clear  Before we take any questions  I need to be clear about this  This situation is grave  We are here to protect public safety  In these neighborhoods here in Watertown right now  I know that there's national media here from all over the country 
[00:41:00]  I know you have a lot of questions about  Who these folks are, where they're from  There will be plenty of time to deal with that  Over the ensuing hours  Right now we've got to deal with this local issue here  So we appreciate your patience  Again, to reiterate what I said earlier  We believe these are the same individuals  That were responsible for the bombing on Monday  At the Boston Marathon  We believe that they're responsible for the death  Of an MIT police officer  And the shooting of an MBTA police officer  This is a very serious situation that we're dealing with  Oh, boy, another  And we would appreciate your cooperation 
[00:41:30]  We'll do the best that we can to Muslims  I'll tell you that  Boy, they can't be happy about this one  But we can't answer every single question  About this investigation at this particular point  I didn't want to see a fucking dumb white guy  You were just listening to a previous press conference  Held by Kurt Schwartz  He's the Homeland Security Advisor  For Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick  As well as some of the other law enforcement officials  Boring, moving on  We're told from authorities  That he and his brother have been in the country  For more than a year 
[00:42:00]  Federal authorities are looking into  Whether they were trained militarily  They're believed to have been trained militarily overseas  Americans may be wondering  Why Chechens would be involved in terror acts  Against the United States  But what we have known for years  Is that Chechens have left Chechnya  Which is really a breakaway republic from Russia  That is very similar in landscape  And similar in  It's a Muslim republic  That is similar to Afghanistan 
[00:42:30]  In feel and nature  And many Chechens go to fight in Afghanistan  So it is likely that these Chechens  Young as they are  May have gone to either Pakistan or Afghanistan  For training as part of a larger foreign terrorist network  We have seen Chechens involved in that in the past  So again, Mike Levine reporting tonight  From his sources  At federal law enforcement sources  That these two suspects  That we received the pictures of 
[00:43:00]  From the FBI earlier today  Are Chechen  One of their names  The one who is on the loose right now  Joker Tsarnaev  And we understand that they have been in the U.S.  A resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts  For more than a year  Bill  Residents of Cambridge  That's where they've been?  Is that right, Jennifer?  That is  Pay attention!  Moving on  Tsarnaev or Tsarnaev  We're looking to confirm that  Born July 22, 1993  That man is at large  That man has shut down 
[00:43:30]  Why is he so large?  Some of those western towns  Just outside Boston  And has shut down  The MBTA  Has shut down  No, this is ready  Universities  This is a completely different part  Of the city  Than I was just at  Where the suspect was believed to be  And here we have an entirely different scene  With a huge  Huge police presence  Right now  The bomb squad  Seems to be wiring  If my experience is correct 
[00:44:00]  It looks like a typical kind of sapper  Who's going to go in and blow  A lot of people think  You know, Chechnya  Is Russia  Like what we  Are familiar with  With Russian  Right  But during the days  Of the old Soviet Union  As we know  They snatched up  A bunch of  Other little nations  And put them under the  Soviet blanket  And then after the fall  Of the Soviet Union  They said  Fuck you  We want  Autonomy  Right  And Chechnya  Is one of those nations  But they have always been 
[00:44:30]  A Muslim  Nation  That is closer to  A Middle Eastern  Afghani  Type  A country  Than Russian  As we know  You know  Russia  Comrade  That kind of stuff  You know  So  This definitely fits the MO  I was  When I heard there were two people  Involved  I really started getting away  From the  One crazy white guy theory  Because it's rare  You get the two crazy white guys 
[00:45:00]  That's almost impossible  Right  You get the Columbine thing  Right  It has happened  Which wasn't  Terrorism per se  As much as it was  Crazy  You know  White guys  Shooting up their  Their school  Kind of a thing  But when you get a  Random terrorist event  Like this  And there's two or more  People involved  It's very rare  That it's going to be  Crazy white guys  Some crazy guys  Some even governmental  You know  Some anti-government  Guy  So now this is 
[00:45:30]  Sort of falling in place  Is that  Typical  Let's kill Americans  MO  So we  Should we get Rocky involved  Rocky Balboa  Yeah well now that we know  We're dealing with Russia  Oh  Oh you mean if it was like  You know  If we can get along here  Right  And we can do it here  We can do it  Right  And then we give them  A slow clap  Right  We need a slow clap here  Surrounding area  Including names you all know  Harvard  BU  BC  Emerson College 
[00:46:00]  MIT  Naming colleges  I'm out  What are you doing  60 people  Were gearing up  And you know  The  Body armor  And tactical gear  And automatic weapons  And  And now it's unclear  Exactly if they have  A specific location  Oh you don't know  What you're talking about  From this item  May  A couple of  Sub  Members over here  Check the building  Still checking address 
[00:46:30]  This is  And if you look at  Some of the Chechenians  Terrorism  In Russia  Over the years  They are some  Ruthless  Motherfuckers  Really  I mean they  Women  Children  They do not  Give a flying fuck  Who dies  For their  For their cause  He's taking himself  Out  But taking others  With him 
[00:47:00]  And so  The authorities  Are doing  What they can  As methodically  As they can  This guy  It's mostly  State police  Where I am right now  As far as I can see  But we essentially  Were asked to leave  The area  So we took a short  Drive  Holy crap  That's a great  Video right now  Fox News live  Looking at a  Suspicious package  Could it be that  Somebody's trying  He just walked away  He just went  Fuck that  They're gonna blow up  Some guy's fucking lunch 
[00:47:30]  Right  That's a wicked package  Next to that tree  Fox  Someone blew up  My god damn  Liverworth sandwich  You cocksucker  I put it down  By the tree  For five god damn  Minutes  To take a god damn  Piss  And you blew up  My god damn  Lunch  You don't want to  Talk about not playing  Boston people  Don't play  No  They fucking  Will tell you  To your face  What they think of you  Controlled explosion  That was probably  A suspicious package  We just saw it  Move slightly 
[00:48:00]  But he definitely  Looked like he was  Part of an EOD team  I wonder  Molly  And you can't see  A screen  Jennifer  Maybe if you've  Been watching this  Was this near  Where we saw  The two people  Handcuffed  That's hard for me  To say from this  Angle  Can't see here  But I will say this  If they detonated  A package  And it didn't have  A secondary explosion  Logic would tell you  That there was  Nothing in there  They don't always  Have secondary explosions  Welcome everyone  To our continuing  Coverage breaking news  On the Boston 
[00:48:30]  Marathon bombings  One suspect is dead  Overnight  Another's on the loose  You are watching right now  When they go to  Those suspicious packages  They always are  Very very careful  And then they lose  Patience  And then they just  Turn it over  Real fast  Yeah  Ah fuck it  Let me turn this thing  Over and see what  Happens  Poor guys  Like looking at  Five different things  On the ground  Right  They gotta be  Nervous wrecks  Those guys  Of course  What you're seeing here  It looks to me like  An EOD specialist  A bomb specialist  Who is carrying out 
[00:49:00]  A controlled explosion  This used to happen  All the time  In Boston Mass  But  If there was a  Downtown Boston  Where is that  They had to dispose of it  And this is the kind of unit  That they would call in  What we know earlier  This evening  Is that they called in  The robots  Because they didn't want  To put a human being  Such as this specialist  A robot  When they  When they found  Some of the explosives  Overnight  Now don't forget  That these two  I know the name  Of the robot  They were making  Their way through  Watertown  Trying to 
[00:49:30]  Send that  Sully  High speed chase  Earlier tonight  They were throwing  What we were  Being described  Talking about  A number of towns  Here  In the general  The arrest  Of the suspect  To take him into custody  Alright NBC's  Kerry Sanders  And now you've been there  Throughout the night  We'll be checking back  In with you  Momentarily  We also have  National security experts  Standing by  Pete Williams  Working the phone  I could hear all three  Yeah  I deciphered all three  Because they're all  Just talking nonsense 
[00:50:00]  Right now  Unexploded ordnance  At this time  All night  Reporting on this  Story overnight  Shortly after  About what exactly  They might have been  Planning to do  We know that  One is dead  And the other  Is still on the line  See I heard it all  That's pretty good  I heard it all  You could just  Pop in and add a shit  I heard it all  Yeah  Alright  Now what  Now what  Now what  Now what  I guess we'll  Keep you informed  We have all of our  Information here 
[00:50:30]  So we are pretty much  Your Boston  Marathon  Bombing  Terrorist  Fugitive  Pursuit  Search  Yeah we are  Station  We're doing just as  Good as these  Knuckleheads  We actually get the  Info out a little  Before  Just a little bit  Yeah whether it's  Right or wrong  Is up for debate  But that info  Flows out of here  A lot faster  Than you will  Your mainstream media  I think we're like  I don't know  Two for three 
[00:51:00]  Yeah we bet  We're doing alright  Our average is pretty good  We're doing alright  In Cambridge  Deb Farrick  Is also joining us  From Watertown  She has the latest  Deb  No you don't  You don't have the latest  So why would you say that  We can tell you  This area is essentially  A frozen zone  People are being told  To shelter in place  To stay away from windows  Stay away from doors  We're looking at a police  Caravan that just passed here  This was a key area  An area  You don't have the latest 
[00:51:30]  That was gathering  We saw a truck  There were armed  Personnel on it  I saw a train  And I saw  And I saw  Really  The impression was  Is they  They were searching  For an IED  It's something that you  Oh shut up  The IUD  You don't have the latest  Don't say you do  Those things poke your pecker  Boylston street  The explosions  Are  Boylston street  The fuck  You're not gonna get me  To watch you  There's no action  On Boylston street  Right now  No  The community 
[00:52:00]  Listened to this  Waking them up  In the dark of night  Yeah this  I'll watch again  This shit is unbelievable  Someone's car alarm  A lot of car alarms right  I got a roofing job  In the morning  You car suckers  I'm trying to sleep  You motherfucker  You woke up  My god damn baby  My dog is awake  My car alarm is blocked

[00:53:00]  Who are still back here  FBI  Police from  All over the state  You have nothing  We can hear birds  If we can hear birds  In your live shot  Guess what  You have nothing  We've got them  Wearing SWAT gear  Tactical uniforms  They've got their  Assault rifles  They've got  Shotguns  They're heavily armed  So this is a very  Serious situation  Again  That's a sparrow  You have nothing  You're wasting my time 
[00:53:30]  By the way  This is what I do  At home  I yell at the TV  And I go from  One to another  You have nothing  They're also looking  To see perhaps  If there are any  Devices that need  To be disarmed  That's the last thing  Police here in Boston  Want  They don't want  A situation  Where somebody  They don't  They don't want that  I should say  Opens up some sort of  A bag  And a device goes off  So that's part  Of what they're doing  Right now  Shut up  A specialist  Did in fact  Make sure  Or detonate  Maybe it was a bomb  Or it wasn't  But get rid of  Whatever it was 
[00:54:00]  On the streets of Boston  Mary Ellen O'Toole  Is joining us  On the couch  The thing that might have been  Ken Moore Square  So what we know now  Mary Ellen  Of these gentlemen  Not gentlemen  Men terrorists  Gentlemen  Gentlemen  What the fuck's  Roar with you  Either for wave number two  Maybe pre-planned  Hey when they figure out  Who we are  Let's go out  And do another wave  Or caught off guard  And trying to make  A getaway  Where do you see it  I see it as them  Being  Basically trying to  Make a getaway  Oh really

[00:55:00]  Unsurprisingly  Officials are taking this  So seriously  Especially when you've now  Found one of the  That perpetrator  Breaking news here  We're hearing the police  Are taking this seriously  Incredibly carefully  Because they are going to  Expect to see  Other IEDs  And provides explosive devices  And booby traps  Absolutely everywhere  They go  Yeah  This is a great exercise  It really is  Yeah  The news most of the time  Has nothing  Nothing  You live in that area  Whoa  Look at those guys  Oh  Thank you  Employers  Anthony

[00:59:30]  How far that is  From where  This police staging ground is  Do you have an indication of that?  No I really don't  As much as we drove around  We've hit about  Three or four different locations  Throughout the evening  Throughout the night here  Oh on Fox News  If you want to follow along  Oh  Yeah they're looking at  This one house  That's like three stories  Not a house  Like an apartment  Oh let's see if  Maybe the scanner  Yeah let's get back to the scanner  And that's coming from 
[01:00:00]  Boston's  Commander  Oh  Oh my god  I guess they detonated something  Brake down lane there  Racing  Yeah

[01:02:00]  Hey what's going on guys  What do you got  What's up Josh  I've been looking  To the scanner  Since like 2am  That house they're at  They went there  About 5, 5.30am  On a report  Of motion sensors  Going off  Motion  The security alarm  Motion sensors  And that's where  They've been for a while  And they said  One of the back doors  Was open  Uh huh  And that was on the scanner  And they've been there  For quite a while  So I don't know  If that's the way  They're trying to raid  Or what  Is that the one  On School Street 
[01:02:30]  I believe so  School Street  Or there was  Another street  They've been mentioning  A lot too  They're uh  I guess they're also  Waiting for other  Other people  To show up there  They just showed  A pretty fucking  Heavy duty  Armored vehicle  With about  A dozen military guys  Hanging off the side  Of it  Driving down the street  Watching it  But I'm stuck in the truck  Looking into it all  This is fucking crazy  It's amazing  How this is just  Going down in front of our eyes  We live in a new  Fucking world  Officially 
[01:03:00]  Alright you  Cocksuckers  Have a good day  Alright  Alright you  Motherfucker  The Boston Globe  Is  Alright this is what  We're going to do  Yeah  We're going to stay  On the channel  Until they fucking  Lose us  It could either be  Me or you  Oh okay  We're going to start  From the top  And work our way down  I don't give a fuck  In latin high school  In june of 2011  That's the globe  The Boston Globe  Is reporting that  This background  On the cell  Clearly  The residents  The residents  Of the two brothers 
[01:03:30]  At least  The one that  We've identified  Here on TV  You're looking at  Them right now  They've been here  In this country  For a while  The larger element  In your question  Meeker  Is  Again  We've been saying  This over and over  And over again  It is entirely  Unprecedented  These communities  Watertown  Especially  And Belmont  And Newton  Literally  But  The city of Boston  Watertown  Is especially close  To the city of Boston 
[01:04:00]  Especially close  Yeah  They're basically  Going to say  Lost me  Yeah  That's not the type  Of areas  That they have  That this happens in  Yeah  Cells  Tourist cells  What I'm noticing  As we look at  The coverage on TV  Yeah  It is playing out  Like a video game  Look  They even have  Their picture  And it's like  Dead  And the next one  Is wanted  Wanted  Like that  Okay now  You've got to  Get him dead  And then this video  Game will be over  Yeah  Yeah  They're the bosses  Wow  A lot of fucking guys  The successes  Of our counterterrorism efforts  Have made 
[01:04:30]  These sort of  You know  Sort of like  Whack-a-moles  How we described it  In government  Oh whack-a-moles  Shut up  Whack-a-moles  You're going to get  A lot of suspicions  I bet  You're probably going to get  A lot of sightings  I bet we'll go on  More than one wild goose chase  Before this is all over  But right now  The latest location  Identified through the state police  Is Norfolk street  In Cambridge  So a good clip away  From here  About kind of in the area  Where the chase  All got started  So Bill  Thanks a lot Mike  Stay there  As we watch  About looks  Be 25 SWAT  Might have forgot 
[01:05:00]  Something at home  Decided to go back home  For a minute  Like fucking  Like Butch  In Pulp Fiction  You have to get the watch  On the kangaroo  Right  Hello come in  Come in  Hello  Talk to me Johnny  Radio 8368  Officer Stewart  Your mercy bus  Going off  Dragonfly  To  Colorful names 
[01:05:30]  This is  Lieutenant Carlito  What's up  Hey  Hey Lieutenant Carlito  The  Armored vehicle element  Has an option  Of  Rotating one  Personnel from a truck  And swapping out  With a medic  If that's what we  If that's what  It's like a video game  Yeah  Alright  Swap out one of my  Riflemen for a medic  Also I need a healer 
[01:06:00]  I need a tank  And I need  Can I get a shaman  Or a shaman  Can we take a break  In the action for a second  Anthony  I need a mage  The morning mashup  Just casually walking  Down the hall  Like nothing's happening  What the fuck  It hits the clock  Alright  We're going to gather  Outside the building 
[01:06:30]  Before we go in  I want to make sure  Everyone's up to date  On the  Leroy  Jenkins  Let's go back to the news  Leasing all these photographs  Before they had  These men on the run  So it's amazing  I think the FBI  Certainly thinks  That they did the right thing  By releasing these pictures  Oh god  Yes  And probably a blast  Injury also 
[01:07:00]  Oh this is the doctor  That  Explosive  Examined the body  Of suspect number one  Now dead  It was pretty much  Throughout the trunk  It was multiple wounds  Would it be  Consistent with  Perhaps a bomb strapped  Would it be consistent  With that  Unclear  I think the medical examiner  Will be able to  Kind of conclusively  Say what's made  If there were signs  Of more than just  Gunshot wounds  Medical examiner  That was one of the two doctors  Who spoke with reporters  At Beth Israel Hospital  Where suspect number one  Was taken with mortal wounds 
[01:07:30]  He died there  And after being killed  In a shootout with police  The doctor said  That the suspect  Had both burns  From an explosion  And also gunshot wounds  Would not say  Which actually were the reason  That he had died  And actually were very reluctant  To go into any details at all  When John and I  Interviewed one of the doctors  Afterwards  We asked if he was wearing  Any sort of suicide vest  Any sort of explosive device  And the doctor would not say  Although Joe Johns  Our law and justice correspondent  Did say  That it is a big suspicion 
[01:08:00]  That suspect number two  Is wearing some sort of  Explosive device  Because suspect number one  According to his law enforcement source  Was also wearing  An explosive device  And earlier  This event has been going out  Throughout the night  We saw an innocent man  Who was suspected by police  As having been part of  This criminal escapade  This terrorist attack  And they made him  Take off all his clothes  Before they arrested him  Because they were  Presumably worried  That he had an explosive on him  So suspect number two 
[01:08:30]  They made me drop  My fucking drawers  They made me drop  My fucking drawers  Here in the middle  Of the goddamn street  Oh my god  That sucks  They made him get naked  That just sucks  Oh that's embarrassing  The public colleges now  In Boston  And the surrounding towns  Have been closed  For the day  Classes canceled  And it's why  Public schools have been canceled  And it's why  People in these  And public transportation  Has been freezed  You gotta think  Some people  Are pissed off about that too  Oh yeah  Yeah  Am I supposed to get 
[01:09:00]  To the fucking liquor store  Wow man  This is fucking  Fucking this place  Going down  Sort of unusual  For it to be on this list  But maybe that is why  He's so  I don't think we can  Take a break  So you can take a break  Something will happen  These cocksuckers  Are gonna go somewhere else  For their coverage  Fucking  Oh but they know  We're your fucking  We're your  We're your news station here  Fuck yeah  We are  Don't worry about it  We're your news station here 
[01:09:30]  We're your news station here  Killed, shot, approached after a car chase, and found to have IEDs on his person.  Still wanted, still at large, the gentleman on the right of your screen there,  known as the man in the white hat, suspect number two, at large,  considered armed and extremely dangerous.  A 19-year-old, these two guys are brothers.  The man at large is Dzhokhar Dzharnath.  We don't know his country of origin just yet.  We're looking to confirm that.  We do know he's 19 years old.  The man we saw in the photographs released last evening by the FBI. 
[01:10:00]  How many stars are we up to right now, you think?  If this was GTA, it used to go up to what, six?  Was it six?  Five or six?  I think five.  Five, maybe?  This is your absolute five-star fucking...  No, I didn't see no fucking helicopters yet.  Oh, there's helicopters.  You think there's helicopters?  Oh, yeah.  Hells, yeah.  Yeah.  There's gotta be.  That sounds like five-star right there. 
[01:10:30]  But another fucking asshole.  Look at how they made their video.  Fucking portrait.  Why don't people understand that yet?  Residents in Watertown are being told to stay inside.  No cars being allowed in or out of Watertown right now.  That town really under complete lockdown.  Other towns in the area, people told to stay at home and businesses to remain closed.  You think they're letting the kids go to school?  And in this manhunt, the web of this manhunt really expanding this morning.  I'm joined again by Julia Kyan.  Well, I got the profile of the guy that's still on the loose. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  This is the shit the media's way behind.  And there's a video.  I'm just gonna push play.  Oh, okay.  Where's your speaker on that?  What is that?  That is a I hate American language.  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:30]  Wow, that language.  Let's get it on full screen.  Holy shit.  Where did that come from?  Go to, who gets the credit today?  Go to BrettC2010 on Twitter.  He gets a big fucking plug today.  This is supposedly, it says, check this out.  It's, I can't say his fucking name.  Profile on Russian Social Network.  Is that the dead guy or the live guy?  I believe it's the live guy.  Oh, look at Sam.  Look what she's wearing.  She's wearing a Not Sam shirt.  Not Sam's shirt on. 
[01:12:00]  As we're fucking trying to keep everyone updated.  She has time to show Sam that she's wearing one of your shirts today.  That's all right.  So this is, what else is on this?  This is his profile.  What does it say?  It looks like him, yeah.  Although, his name is spelled, his first name is, there's no K.  Yeah, but they're fucking, they're not really sure if it's being spelled right.  Yeah, is that name like Bob Smith in Chechnya?  Right.  That name might be, you know. 
[01:12:30]  But, yeah.  It looks like him.  I'm saying yes.  All right, let's go with yes again.  Shoot him.  Let's go with yes again.  What does it say on his profile page?  Give me some of the stats there, Sam Roberts.  I mean, it says he speaks English and his birthday is July 22nd, but everything else is in Russian.  So it could say...  Well, slow down.  And he's got some videos.  Is there any English on that damn page?  No.  No English.  All right, let's play the video just to scare people.  That looks like him.  Huh?  That looks like him.  Yeah, this video is fucking frightening.  What's he saying? 
[01:13:00]  Are you opening?  Shut up.  Write in the comments to see if anyone knows what the fuck he's saying in this.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Maharena.  He's got a night.  Greatest country in the world. 
[01:13:30]  Madison Square Garden.  He's saying, I will humble you.  Holy fuck.  And fuck your ass.  He's saying, someone translate, download this video, what's this terrorist saying?  Durka, Durka, Durka, Durka.  Durka, Durka.  Oh, yeah.  Burning in hell as we speak.  See, everyone is there already.  And the news won't even be to the spot for another hour or two.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And then they blow up. 
[01:14:00]  It's great.  E-Rock, your news was Trumped again.  You know that, right?  E-Rock has a story, right?  Yeah, we'll get to it after they catch this guy.  Yeah, we have to.  We're going to need to talk about something else for the next two hours.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What else is going on?  We got Ronnie today from the Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  And then we can finally put the Jersey Shore to rest because he's the last guy.  I think we've talked to everyone. 
[01:14:30]  He kind of looks like the guy.  I'm saying shoot him.  Isn't Vinny going to come back in, too?  Vinny's got a new show.  Yeah, no, but we're friends with Vinny, so he can come by anytime he wants.  Yeah, Ronnie, today...  And if Ronnie's cool, then maybe we become friends with him, and he can come back anytime he wants.  Today is the day to promote smush cocktails.  That's bad.  Oh, fuck.  Years ago, we also know that the brothers lived in Cambridge.  If you're in one of the surrounding towns, Waltham or Cambridge, you are also being told that you should stay at home. 
[01:15:00]  They do not know exactly where suspect number two is.  So, essentially, the entire community of Watertown remains this massive crime scene.  Eric?  Yeah, I just don't know how long they can secure a crime scene this big, this large, while still telling everyone to stay in their house.  And the mass transportation's been shut down.  Cities have been basically shut down.  People are staying off the streets, and countless numbers of police officers, all levels, ATFs, all skills, SWAT, and training. 
[01:15:30]  This is obviously a test to see how martial law is going to work on a smaller scale.  They're getting into this town, shutting it down, bringing in the military and the police,  just to see how easy it's going to be to keep people sequestered in their homes  and get military personnel and resources on the streets.  Meanwhile, one patsy dead, another one being searched out.  He will absolutely be killed.  This is a false flag operation.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.  Oh, yeah.  Now what? 
[01:16:00]  Police scanner time again.  I'm checking Twitter.  So, a lot of people go into that, uh, the suspect's profile page.  Oh, yeah?  But we don't know how to speak that language, so we're fucked.  No, that's some dirty language.  Yeah.  Headquarters.  Headquarters.  People are saying that language is Russian.  We know that, with a Middle Eastern accent.  Yeah, that's a pretty fucked up combination right there.  Yeah.  Russian accent with a Middle...  Russian and Middle Eastern accent, all in one. 
[01:16:30]  No, so we're 10.  We're on.  Yeah?  I have it, sir.  Tango Echo 504, I'm going to head over to South Station as well.  We have that, sir.  What do you have over there?  Shut down.  Tango 912, sir, they're requiring what you have down there at South Station. 
[01:17:00]  We received a call, but they have a suspicious package at the TSO system.  Oh, suspicious package.  We have it.  They have so many suspicious package calls.  Yeah, that's unbelievable.  Holy shit.  Yeah, 29 car more, Florida South.  Have they translated that video yet? 
[01:17:30]  Keep going back there, because everyone's over there.  I just got a thing.  The city of Boston, or the city of Cambridge, I guess, awarded...  He's one of the people that was awarded a $2,500 scholarship from Citizens and Businesses. 
[01:18:00]  35 to 45 scholarships are awarded each year.  Nice.  That's nice.  That's nice.  Yeah, he was honored.  Oh, he was honored, was he?  I guess last May it must have been.  Oh, that's very nice.  Oh, very nice.  It's all right.  Yeah, and there's his name right there.  All right.  Got a little scholarship.  Nice 2,500 big ones for education.  For the pressure cooker!  Damn it!  And the ball bearings!  Right.  You cocksuckers!  Yeah, fucking...  You're a goddamn cocksucker.  What is that?  That's live? 
[01:18:30]  Which one?  Where are we going?  Here?  We have a photo of him with the dark baseball cap, based on the photos that were released  yesterday.  He was shot dead.  We know.  The second suspect was able to flee from that car, and there was an active...  And don't pay attention to any news coverage if it's still dark out.  That's old shit!  It's old.  So you're done.  It's 7.30 a.m.  I don't need a time check!  Oh, thank God she told me.  I thought it was like noon.  He did die, not only from bullet wounds, but from shrapnel wounds.  That makes some people believe that some of the same shrapnel that was in those victims 
[01:19:00]  on Monday...  See the news, they get that one sheet.  If there's nothing new, they just keep fucking rolling through it over and over and over again.  Pound it.  You know, people are waking up, though.  You know?  They wake up.  Who the fuck is still sleeping?  I don't know.  I'd like to be.  We know no one in Watertown.  No one in Watertown with those fucking...  The gunfire, sirens, people knocking on my door.  Stop knocking on my door!  You've already cleared my fucking house, you cocksucker! 
[01:19:30]  Stop knocking!  You know they're in there just fucking pissed.  We lived it.  We lived it for three years up there.  Only three years.  M&B's totaling almost 400,000 people.  Stay in your home.  Oh my God, of course.  Stay in your homes.  Earlier we heard from a witness who told us how they hurt explosives.  Oh, really?  They hurt explosives, did they?  I thought we heard firecrackers, so me and my son looked out our third floor window. 
[01:20:00]  And we heard gunshots, and then we saw the explosion.  I actually saw a black SUV come down Laurel Street, cross over Dexter.  It looked like it hit a police car, and then they were just shooting at that, and then just loaded with that.  We must have heard about 60 gunshots.  Wow.  It is a city under siege to a large degree.  City under siege!  Oh, it's the fucking news just jacking off. 
[01:20:30]  Look at this guy, just chilling on his motorcycle.  Businesses are told not to open.  Again, 7.30 local time here.  It's about 90 minutes before the pandemic gets underway.  In Watertown, all vehicle traffic has been banned.  Colleges.  Here's the list.  Harvard, MIT.  All right, definitely a microcosm of what will happen when martial art is enacted.  Northeastern, excuse me.  They're doing the snow closings, basically.  It's safe to say you don't have to go to school today. 
[01:21:00]  And if your school is the one school that decided to fucking have class, I think they'll understand in the end.  You quark suckers.  I don't think anyone's going to school in Watertown.  Oh, wait.  Explosions.  I recognized that something was really wrong and called the emergency department to let them know.  And then quickly got dressed to come into work and rushed over to the emergency department.  All we know is he arrived in arrest here.  We don't really know what happened at the scene. 
[01:21:30]  So he was in cardiac arrest before he even got into the emergency room?  That's correct.  We believe a combination of blasts and potentially gunshot wounds.  Would he be consistent with perhaps a bomb strapped to him?  Would he be consistent with that?  He doesn't know.  I think the medical general will be able to kind of conclusively say that.  Yeah, but reporters think if they can ask the question a little differently,  something is going to fucking trip him up.  Yeah, something in his head will go, oh, oh, okay.  Now he's clarified.  Consistent with a bomb being strapped to his body?  Well, that's unclear at this time.  So are you saying that maybe a bomb was strapped to his body? 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Well, again, I think that's unclear.  Damn it, damn it.  So would some of the wounds perhaps, would you think, be caused by a bomb strapped to his body?  Yes, I think it is.  Oh, now that you put it that way.  Got him.  Got him.  His worldview is Islam.  It is.  On his page.  Of course it is.  They are permanent residents of the United States of America. 
[01:22:30]  So they moved here.  Yes.  That's good.  I love immigration and diversity.  A police officer at MIT this morning.  One police officer is dead.  And again, after they left that scene, throwing explosives out of the car, coming here,  and then one of the suspects being shot as well.  But we're here, unprecedented, this town again, on lockdown, on high alert.  They're staying in their homes.  Those who are...  By the way, if you're bored of our coverage, the Howard Stern channel has a Jessica Hahn interview  from 1992.  Wow.  Nice.  Enjoy.  I remember that.  They have been radicalized.  They have been... 
[01:23:00]  It's like getting a little shot in every once in a while.  How do you miss this?  I mean, what we...  When you come into work and say, fuck, I got to do a show?  Very busy.  We even went on the air five minutes early today.  Your scene is on.  Go ahead.  Locker 1448.  Got a man doing sound here.  All right.  One of them that stand by here.  Yeah.  Somebody called him.  Call him to stay here.  Yeah, that ambulance is for...  Just stand by for Nemlex. 
[01:23:30]  What?  Just have them...  Swat.  Look out my fucking window.  There's a goddamn swat team in my yard.  A goddamn swat team.  Trampling all over my yard.  All over my yard.  I just seen the goddamn thing.  How is my fucking grass supposed to grow in when there's a goddamn swat team trotting on my yard?  You trampled my wife's goddamn tulips. 
[01:24:00]  I swear to you, Boston, we're doing this with love today.  Oh, my God.  With goddamn love.  What was that?  You didn't come through.  Breaker, breaker.  Breaker 1-9.  Breaker 1-9 for a smoky report in Watertown.  I need a smoky report. 
[01:24:30]  Stand by next to that intersection on School Street in Arsenal.  School Street.  I think I saw a Kojak with a Kodak on Boylston.  We got guys in custody all over the place.  But I'm out of use in custody.  We'll get back to you.  Lockdown.  We're chief, sir. 
[01:25:00]  Watertown, Massachusetts is on lockdown at this hour.  And just to give you an idea, Mika, to what people in these commuters are waking up to this morning,  this is a photograph taken by a woman in Watertown, Massachusetts named Shawna England.  We saw that fucking an hour ago.  She's looking out.  Yeah, no kidding, we did.  We just see this shit like, the news is so slow these days.  Swap gear on the shed in her back.  I mean, we're fucking off, but we're also fucking ahead of these assholes.  ...describe them just west of...  Anyone that has Twitter has seen that picture already. 
[01:25:30]  Midnight, and so they are clearly engaged in a very active search for this individual.  Well, his brother, as I said, was killed.  Oh, my God.  And she's so far away from the action.  She's the one with the birds that you can hear.  Whoa, what are they doing there?  Which one are we going to?  We're getting a bunch of stades.  Again, we are still getting a very, very heavy presence here.  But we are learning more about the identity of the man who was killed last night, just around midnight. 
[01:26:00]  You know that one picture from last night that circulated, and now they are saying is real,  and the suspect with the white hat running, running away from, and you see the blast still happening in the background, obviously.  A lot of people thought that was Photoshop, but now they're showing it so many times, it looks like it's a real picture.  It looks like it's real.  And what makes it disturbing is the, did you see the old guy laughing in that picture?  No.  Could you pop that picture up that went around last night? 
[01:26:30]  Look at these stades.  They're like in fucking military step marks.  The college student at Bunker Hill Community College, his aspirations to be an engineer.  That's what we know so far.  Jake, John?  Deb, that's some great reporting.  Just to recap what you said, the older brother, and I suspect that that's the one who has been killed,  suspect number one with the black hat, went to Bunker Hill Community College.  He and his younger brother, who is suspect number two in the white hat, who is on the loose in Watertown or the surrounding area, 
[01:27:00]  those two and their family fled Chechnya.  Then their family went to Kazakhstan.  And, of course, then they landed up here in the Boston area.  Great.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Good one.  Do all the sources have any information about what exactly the motivation was?  I mean, it sounds to me like...  Yeah, no one knows what...  Yeah.  So, uh...  That's right.  No.  No.  It's the one that was going around last night.  Where he's like at the corner?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Um...  I mean, I had no next year.  I'm not...  Uh...  No, no, no.  Wow.  That's fucking, uh...  You know, guaranteed...  And I was just goofing, like, off the top of my head.  Right.  But guaranteed, Alex Jones and a lot of people will say that this is a great exercise in locking down a town.  Right.  In what it takes and the ability to, for the military and the police to come in, lock a town down, uh, flood the streets with resources, keep everyone in their homes, and see how it pans out. 
[01:28:00]  See how cooperative the people are if they think it's under the guise of fear and safety to come in like this.  Um...  Guaranteed they start fucking talking about that.  Because this, it's a great example.  And for them to say that the bombing and the shootout and everything was just, um, to justify this exercise. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  That will be the headline, the big fucking, um...  Of course.  Bottom line for all these conspiracy guys now.  So that's the picture of the guy, you know, running away.  All right.  A lot of people weren't sure it was real or photoshopped.  Yeah, he's going around the corner.  Look at the fucking, uh, older guy in the front.  Yeah, he's fucking chuckling.  He's just chuckling.  Like, how, how unaware can a person be?  Pretty unaware.  There's all hell breaking loose down the street.  You still see the smoke and a shitload of people running, uh, in the direction of, of, uh, this older guy with sunglasses. 
[01:29:00]  And he's just leaning on the guardrail, like, laughing.  Yeah, he's right.  Well, look.  So people are like, he should be checked out.  No, I think he's just an idiot that is not aware of what the fuck is going on.  Not a clue.  Going on around his surroundings.  And then, of course, the suspect number two with the white hat running around the corner.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  That picture went around last night and a lot of people trying to say it was photoshopped.  But now it's looking like it is a real fucking picture of the guy fleeing the scene.  Yeah.  And then the one picture that went around last night was just fucking deeply depressing.  Which one's that?  Uh, you got suspect number two again. 
[01:29:30]  And you could see him right behind that Martin kid who was eight years old.  Yeah.  Was that real?  Well, another.  Because he looks like, that looks like the picture that they.  A lot of people saying that could have been photoshopped as well.  But you see what looks like the backpack on the ground.  Suspect number two sort of in the background.  And then the Martin kid.  This is definitely a real picture of the Martin kid and his family.  Yeah.  There's the eight-year-old just checking out the fucking marathon. 
[01:30:00]  And, of course, we learn later that he died in the explosion.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe that one is photoshopped and maybe the other one wasn't.  Who knows?  But it is still deeply depressing to see just a kid alive right behind the eight-year-old Martin Richards.  These Chechnyans are ruthless when it comes to their terrorism.  Right.  Because I think it was 2004.  I'm not sure of the year.  But they took over a school. 
[01:30:30]  It was 1,100 people, 777 children.  And it ended with the deaths of 380 people.  That's when they wired the school with explosives.  Completely wired the school with explosives.  And wound up setting it off.  And really no regard for children, obviously, when they think they have this cause.  Right.  It's crazy.  What is their cause?  I think it's their separatism. 
[01:31:00]  They want complete autonomy for themselves.  And just hatred for the West, you know.  Right.  Shit like that.  Great.  We're just getting this report from Pete Williams, Michael.  First of all, the names of the subsex and some updates on their ages.  Dzhokhar Sarnyev, born in 1993.  He's the one identified by the FBI.  He's wearing the white hat. 
[01:31:30]  He does have, again confirming a Massachusetts license, a resident of Cambridge.  And we are told now he was born in Kyrgyzstan.  Kyrgyzstan.  His brother is Tamerlan Sarnyev.  And his age is now being put at 26.  What?  Born in Russia.  And became a legal permanent resident here in 2007.  Also, Pete Williams reporting, we've been told the brothers came with their family to the  United States in either 2002 or 2003. 
[01:32:00]  So, again, very fresh information.  No reason to draw any conclusions from just this.  More pieces of the puzzle that we will slowly pull together.  The bigger issue right now is that are the biggest risk for this.  You know, but that's our...  You think we have time to take a break?  Probably do, right?  Yeah, we'll take a break and come back.  I really want to...  What?  I really want to hear the E-Rock story about...  Oh, we'll get to it.  Yeah.  If there's a break in the action, we'll do the E-Rock story, which is pretty damn impressive. 
[01:32:30]  Are you talking about what happened?  I don't see why I can't.  All right, well, E-Rock had an exciting night, to say the least.  To say the least.  An exciting night for E-Rock?  More exciting, you think, than the people of Watertown?  Oh, definitely not.  No.  No?  No.  People are saying...  Not people are saying.  I don't like doing that game.  It's Dreyas, D-R-E-Y-E-S-81 on Twitter. 
[01:33:00]  He says Alex Jones' website said there would be a staged capture on Friday.  He'll never let this go now.  No, this is going to be a big one for Alex.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, like I said earlier, as soon as I heard that one of the suspects was killed, I'm like,  no, that place where it's Alex Jones' hands.  I know.  Kill the Patsy.  Yeah, boy.  Fuck, he always says that.  Yeah.  They killed the Patsy.  This has everything he talks about in one, like, episode. 
[01:33:30]  This is perfect for him.  Right.  All right.  I have a conspiracy that Alex Jones is responsible for this.  Oh, fuck.  So that he can do his shows, his various shows and website and everything, because it's too  perfect for him.  Right.  This is everything he thinks is a conspiracy happening at once.  I think we ought to look into Alex Jones.  And I think we should try to get him on the phone next.  He could do a couple minutes with us today, can't he?  He'll tell us what the fuck's going on.  No.  Will he ever?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:34:00]  I'm going to just do this live read cold, because we probably have a lot of live reads.  Oh, boy.  I see a lot of, like, junk in the studio.  So that's all, like, sponsors giving us stuff to try out for Mother's Day, I'm assuming.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  But we're not talking about Mother's Day right now.  We are talking about GoToMeeting.com.  We met with the fine people at GoToMeeting.com, and, yeah, we're pretty excited to be working  with these guys.  Yes.  They're on to something.

We all know about Skype and FaceTime and all that, but they go a little further than that.  You get to see the person you're having a meeting with, but then you can fool around  with their fucking desktop. 
[01:35:00]  Their documents, photographs, everything.  John, give me control of your desktop, because I want to show you what's going on over here.  I'm going to check this out.  With the Johnson file.  Give me the Johnson file.  The Penske file, yes.  Let's make some changes in the Johnson file.  Well, yeah, of course.  The Penske file.  All right.  Now you have control of your desktop, and now you can do a thing or two.  All right.  Now let me have control of your desktop, because I want to change this and that.  Yeah.  That type of shit goes on.  That's pretty cool, no?  Old man Leland's busting my hump over those reports.

Now, back to our show.  All right.  Continuing coverage of what's going on up there in Boston and Watertown.  One suspect dead.  The guy in the white hat on the loose still, officially. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Really fast before we go back to the coverage.  Sam, I did not know that.  I want to bring it to everyone's attention.  Well, you just told me.  Well, Gary's out today.  Oh, yeah?  The radio wizard.  And we're suspicious.  And we're doing grilled cheese and mojito day.  Yeah.  And milkshakes.  And milkshakes.  And milkshakes?  Yeah.  We got a milk truck coming or something?  Yeah, the milk truck is coming.  It's called the milk truck?  Yeah.  They specialize in grilled cheese and milkshakes. 
[01:39:00]  Milkshakes.  And milkshakes.  Wow.  That's what I call big tits.  They're at the smorgasbord.  The fucking milk truck's coming.  Fucking tits.  Classic dude.  It's so good.  Class, yeah.  And when is that going down?  And the Cuban will be here, too.  I love the fucking Cuban.  Ricky Ricardo?  Yeah.  You know the Cuban.  He rules.  Yeah.  He's entertaining as all.  I do like the Cuban.  Cubano.  It'll be around 8.30, 9 o'clock.  Oh, soon.  Okay.  All right.  Good.  Yeah, and the radio wizard won't be in our way because he took today off. 
[01:39:30]  Gary's been on vacation all week.  I am?  Yeah.  Did you guys not know?  He hasn't been here Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, today.  Not one of the days this week.  Sam, I swear to you.  Yeah?  I swear to you.  Yeah.  I'm breaking down the wall.  I'm talking to his great cues.  Please do.  I like that.  I swear to you.  I had no idea.  None.  You didn't either, Ian.  No.  No.  When Roland said that Gary's not here, I go, oh, he decided to take Friday.  And you guys even stayed after and had a meeting at one point this week.  You really had no clue. 
[01:40:00]  None.  Did the oops or dope?  No.  Who?  Nope.  Wow.  Not even Greg Opie Hughes.  None of the three alter egos had any idea.  No clue.  And I'm not fucking making a bit.  That's scary.  I believe you.  I believe you.  That is scary.  I just assumed he took today off.  No, all week.  People take Fridays off here and there, sure.  Who's covering for him?  Who's covering what he does?  Boss Cross.  Normally.  I guess Rob Cross is.  So what extra duties did he have to take on to cover? 
[01:40:30]  I heard an office chair is covering this week.  Just an empty chair.  Just an office chair.  With a hoodie on the back of it, just in case.  So you're not sure if the guy's not here.  They just took a big chrome mixing bowl and put it on top of the chair.  Wow.  That sucks for him that we don't even know when he's on vacation.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, it still was.  I mean, it was.  Maybe even this week was probably a better week of radio than last week. 
[01:41:00]  And last week was great.  But it's.  All right.  We might be getting some updates.  We'll get back to.  What?  How useless the radio wizard is after these.  After what's going on in Watertown.  To address those after this.  But for right now, this is about public safety.  This is about the Watertown neighborhood.  This is live, by the way.  I think.  Yes.  Who's going to speak?  The governor spoke.  And now some police guy spoke.  And that's it.  Now they're walking away.  So they don't really have anything now?  No.  They said stay in your fucking house. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  And that's about it.  Are they confident they got them trapped in this area of Watertown or what?  I don't know.  This guy wants to give us a firsthand account of what's going on.  The odd thing is, it doesn't seem like they're putting any resources anywhere else.  Right.  Which leads me to believe that they're pretty confident they have them in this perimeter.  Right.  Or else they would have maybe set up roadblocks on some of the highways or elsewhere.  But it seems like they're really just concentrating on this area. 
[01:42:00]  By the way, allergy season has officially begun.  Oh, yeah?  I want to rip my eyeballs out of my fucking head.  Oh.  It always starts with the itchies right here.  Yeah.  You know, that spot between the eyeball and the fucking goddamn nose.  I'm sure people are very sympathetic about your suffering right now.  Holy fuck, man.  Well, what do you do for it?  By the way, the guy that's still at large, apparently he's been in the country for about 10 years.  He's a registered voter.  Well, apparently the radio wizard's been here for eight at this company. 
[01:42:30]  So what gives?  I guess no impact on it for either of them.  Okay.  Apparently he's worked for this company for a long time.  Yes.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry.  I've got a new bullhorn.  I've got a new bullhorn.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm so happy now.  Can you do some, even though that was Days of the New, do some STP, please.  I'm smashing sets, putting on the wands. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, you're right with that.  Can you do dead and blown off?  Dead and blown, dead and blown off.  Love it.  Ladies and gentlemen, I got my pilots back, my police radio, also telephone.  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  We're back.  We might have an eyewitness.  So far, the phones have given us nothing today.  No, let's see.  Dan in Watertown.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, Ope.  Yeah, I'm in Watertown.  I'm literally like a street or two down from where, like all the footage is at Tarsinal Street.  You see the mall in the background.  Like last night, I was coming home from a bar and I thought I heard something.  It turned out this morning, I thought it was like gunfire.  It sounded like popping and stuff.  It was kind of distant. 
[01:44:00]  But, you know, I went to bed and I heard news about the MIT police officer that got shot.  I didn't know that it was related or anything.  But apparently this morning, you know, I'm getting phone calls and texts from everybody that we basically can't, like, leave our houses.  And there's SWAT teams everywhere going house to house.  But apparently the one guy that's still on the loose, I mean, they're saying, like, Watertown is the sort of the center of everything that's going on.  But all the surrounding towns, so Belmont, Arlington, Waltham, everything's pretty much shut down right now. 
[01:44:30]  You can't, like, can't even go on the street.  So that's basically where it's at.  What are you doing?  Watching TV?  Yeah, I am.  I'm just watching TV and I got my police scanner on.  Yes.  Actually, I was going to say, I kind of wish that I had a gun permit at this point.  Yeah, what if that guy busts into your house, right?  He's being chased, he runs, he busts into your fucking house to take refuge. 
[01:45:00]  What do you do?  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  I mean, I've been meaning to get it.  And, you know, these things don't, you know, it's kind of like a, you never think it's going to happen.  But I'm pretty close to sort of, like, where all the action is.  You know where I would be?  I would be on my couch, right?  Watching TV.  Yeah.  But I would have an AR-15 right next to me with my 10-round mag, but only seven rounds in it, because if I load it up with 10, that's illegal. 
[01:45:30]  So I'd only have seven rounds in it.  And I would sit there and wait if anything happened, it came through the door.  I would hope that I could dispatch him within the seven allotted rounds that I'm allowed to have.  That's the legislation, too, right?  That's so ridiculous.  They were going to, the law was going to be, and it took effect just a few days ago, the law was going to be that you ought to have a seven-round magazine.  You weren't even allowed to have a 10-round magazine.  You ought to have a seven-round magazine or less. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  They do not make seven-round mags.  So now they've, through the goodness of their heart, have allowed New Yorkers, this is for New York State, by the way, they've allowed New Yorkers to use their 10-round mags.  You're allowed to have them.  Thank you very much.  But you're only allowed to load seven bullets in the magazine.  And that's going to make sure.  That's going to bum out a lot of bad guys.  Bad guys, when they go to perpetrate a crime. 
[01:46:30]  Only take seven.  They will only load seven rounds in.  Now, honestly, doesn't that only, only put the law on the law-abiding citizens that would load 10 rounds in?  Imagine you're in a shootout with a bad guy, and you got your seven.  You fire your seven, and guess what?  He's got fucking 30.  Well, let's just go with the 10 even.  Let's go with the 10 even, right.  He's got 10.  All right, I got an even shot here.  He's got three rounds more than you. 
[01:47:00]  Going back and forth, and next thing you know, your seven's done, and he's got three to go.  Three rounds more than you.  Fuck.  Unbelievable.  Dan, this is some great eyewitness reporting.  I really appreciate it.  That added a new angle that we haven't heard on the news yet.  That's right.  We learned that in our fucking radio days.  Adding more layers to the story.  Oh, right.  Remember that?  And then when you exhaust the topic, you go to the phones.  Go to the phones.  They'll give you a new energy.  And then they come up with something that you weren't even thinking about. 
[01:47:30]  Remember that?  Yes, I do.  Thank you, Dan.  Let's go to the coverage again.  Or the police can actually localize where he is.  And I think they're wise to take the precaution of making sure that everybody is staying inside  and sheltering in place because he could be looking to grab a car and move someplace else.  Yeah.  And the question also is...  There's no question.  At this point, he's not grabbing a car and going somewhere else.  They got him locked the fuck down.  If he goes into someone's house, grabs their car, does one of those things where he's in the back seat 
[01:48:00]  and holds a gun to the guy and goes drive out, but the cops would stop him and serve the car.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Let's see what CNN has.  Reporting all morning, people have been told to stay in place, to be...  How many times have we heard that?  Dude, look at all the Humvees rolling down the street.  You know it is a police officer.  Unless you know it is a member of the armed services, you have to look for identification  and check identification.  And speaking to police officers here, as they come by to tell us, quite frankly, to be careful 
[01:48:30]  because this suspect, they don't know what kind of ammunition he has, what kind of weapon he has.  They know that he has long rifles, and they said those long rifles can go far.  And this person, they believe, is in this area, and he feels like a trapped animal.  And if he comes out, they don't know if he's going to want to go out in a hail of gunfire.  See, this asshole Don Lemon is trying to make himself part of the story, like he's actually in some kind of danger.  Yeah.  He's so far away from the fucking actions.  Very far away.  Very funny.  I wonder if he's registered his assault rifle, this guy. 
[01:49:00]  Probably did.  I wonder if he went through the background check to get his fully automatic assault rifle that he's using.  Over a thousand children taken hostage, 300 or more killed.  The Chechens got their start in terrorism by bombings.  We fucking did this a half hour, 40 minutes ago.  We just did this break.  And whether when you were Homeland Security Chief or before or after, when you had to consider the possible... 
[01:49:30]  Well, the news cycle's in downtime right now.  Yeah.  Let's check the scanner real quick.  Yeah, let's do that.  If there's any news coming...  Yeah, Tango Echo 5, we have the message.  I'll relay it.  Tango Echo 5.  Yes?  Hello?  That's the message, right?  I think we'll...  They're blocking the message.  What happened? 
[01:50:00]  From us.  Is Chris Matthews still going with his right-wing tea party person?  Mm-hmm.  Is he still going with that one?  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  No?  Anything?  Hello, officer.  Hello?  Officer!  Officer!  Someone's at my door! 
[01:50:30]  Let's have him back up this street.  Hmm.  No.  Seems like nothing on the police scanner, either.  A lot of noise on scanners.  Yeah.  A lot of noise.  Hmm.  You can honestly think, by this time, it would be very clear.  Hello, officer.  Can't think.  Receive, sir.  Control, 7-2.  7-2.  7-8.  On a 5-shout sign in Route Watertown. 
[01:51:00]  What?  What was that?  I thought I heard something.  I only got one more, anyway.  Nothing gets to that.  Exactly.  Well, you know, hang in until, uh, until then, Napa 23, you're not, uh, no longer required  to hang in.  Nah, nothing really going on.  Nah, nothing really going on yet. 
[01:51:30]  We'll keep you posted, though.  Yeah, of course we will.  We're on a police scanner.  Very, um, very fluid situation, as they say.  Very fluid.  Been a crazy, it's almost, what, ten hours of action.  It's been crazy, like, since this happened.  True.  Very, uh, crazy.  Have you seen, did you see, uh, Obama's speech yesterday from the, um, multicultural, multi-religious,  non-denominational, everyone's included, motherfucking church thing? 
[01:52:00]  Where the fuck did he find that church in Boston?  Holy shit, right?  What?  How come?  What little corner is that on?  Really?  That is, uh, surrounded by completely white neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, uh.  I tweeted yesterday, I said, I hope Boston sprinkles some black people around before Obama  gets there.  Sprinkle?  Just sprinkle them about a little bit.  Are you kidding?  You can't make him happy when he sees how white that fucking city is. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  And how segregated it really is.  Yeah.  Well, he knows.  He went to fucking Harvard.  Yeah, that's true.  He knows that shit.  Well, that area's a little different.  Yeah.  Yeah, that Cambridge area's a little different.  But he gave his speech yesterday, and, uh, I was watching some of the, uh, more liberal  leaning news, uh, organizations.  Oh, were ya?  Drooling.  Drooling.  This speech will go down in history.  The comforter-in-chief.  Oh, really?  Ugh!  It was just another scripted, um, no real humanity to it, rah-rah, feel-good speech 
[01:53:00]  about, um, you know, well, they sure, I love how they say about Boston, no offense to Boston,  this is offense to the news and everything else, you know, they sure picked the wrong  city when they picked Boston when it, it's like they would say that about anything.  They said it about New York.  Well, look at what they're saying about West.  Yeah.  West Texas.  West Texas.  Oh, what, what, what happened there?  How amazing that area is. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Uh, but, you know, honestly, his speech was very, it was more self-serving than it was  anything else.  Well, we got a couple clips, uh, I'll be the judge.  All right.  I'll listen for myself and make my own opinions, sir.  The Honorable Greg Hughes will be presiding over this film clip.  I'm not going to take your word for it.  All right.  What's the problem in this world right now?  Can't take my word for it.  I already fucking asked for the execution of some innocent young missing lad. 
[01:54:00]  Terrible.  He's just a guy that's sad and fucking decided to disappear.  Poor missing guy.  Right.  Uh, if Obama cured cancer, would you give him props?  Uh, I would say, well, who did that for him to go out and, but if he handed in like, like  a Brian Reagan bit, okay, I don't believe here's the cure for cancer.  I would believe that it came from elsewhere. 
[01:54:30]  You would, right?  Yeah.  I can't see him doing anything good or constructive or good for the country.  Here's a highlight of, uh, Obama in Boston yesterday.  Yeah.  I kind of like went, Ooh, when I heard Boston, you'll run again.  Oh my God.  Really?  Yeah.  A celebration became a tragedy.  Hmm.  And so we come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss. 
[01:55:00]  But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace.  As you begin this long journey of recovery, your city is with you.  Mm-hmm.  Your commonwealth is with you.  Your country is with you.  We will all be with you as you learn to stand.  Solar system.  And walk.  And yes, run again.  Oh.  Of that, I have no doubt you will run again.  Oh, boy. 
[01:55:30]  I missed.  What the fuck did the colored guy say?  What the hell is this colored guy saying about our city?  Who let him out of Roxbury?  What happened?  God damn it.  One got loose. 
[01:56:00]  Just no.  They're all supposed to stay in their own goddamn areas.  Not running around all willy-nilly.  That's something I wanted to say there.  I can't remember.  Fuck.  Well, we got more Obama.  Oh.  This is what I want to say.  And I wasn't a fan of the fucking guy.  Mitt Romney was on TV yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  He was at that thing.  I don't know what...  I guess they all were kind of talking to him yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  I was like, who the fuck is this guy?  He was so much more focused.  Was he?  Yes.  Yeah.  And I was really listening to what he had to say about the situation.  He did not make a good candidate.  But I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it was the same guy.  And when the campaign was going down, a lot of people were trying to say that.  That something's not right.  He's nervous.  Something's going on.  The guy they had on TV yesterday, I'm like, wow, he was presidential. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  He looked like a fucking leader.  That was in his wheelhouse, you know, being the ex-governor and shit like that.  He knows a lot about Massachusetts, obviously.  I think he was so afraid of winning that he undermined his own fucking campaign.  The confidence he had yesterday on TV, man.  Effortless, too.  Effortless.  Yeah.  A good communicator.  A very good communicator yesterday.  I couldn't believe it. 
[01:57:30]  More Obama from the church.  Our common creed that cuts across whatever superficial differences there may be, that is our power.  That's our strength.  That's why a bomb can't beat us.  That's why we don't hunker down.  That's why we don't cower in fear.  Well, we kind of do sometimes.  We carry on. 
[01:58:00]  We race.  We strive.  We build and we work and we love and we raise our kids to do the same.  And we come together to celebrate life and to walk our cities and to cheer for our teams.  When the Sox and Celtics and Patriots or Bruins or champions again, to the chagrin of New York and Chicago fans,  the crowds will gather and watch a parade go down Boylston Street.  And this time next year, on the third Monday in April, the world will return to this great American city to run harder than ever 
[01:58:30]  and then cheer even louder for the 118th Boston Marathon.  Martin Luther yawn.  Jesus Christ.  He's trying to rally the troops there.  That's like a hell of an ending to a speech right there.  Nice crescendo.  Yeah.  What does Mars got on this whole thing? 
[01:59:00]  We haven't heard from Mars.  This is our filler.  Well, you'd think people would.  As the news just kind of says the same thing over and over again.  He'll be like, clueless, like, did they say who was involved?  Like, oh, Mars, where you been?  Here he comes.  Yo, Mars, what do you got in this?  Mars.  What do you got in this?  From the Hispanic perspective, what do you got in this?  Let's get a Hispanic perspective.  You're just very happy it's not a Hispanic, right?  No, actually, the Chechnya people, one of the worst type of terrorists there. 
[01:59:30]  They are terrible terrorists.  People don't realize, man.  They were the ones behind that school.  The school, yeah, where they killed, like, fucking...  Killed kids.  Bunch of kids.  Over 300 people.  Oh, my God.  A shitload of children.  No, no, no.  What do you...  No.  Don't...  Don't...  No.  Why?  I thought he was just reiterating.  He's listening to our show.  He's just saying what you said.  Oh, damn it.  I didn't realize.  He's had our show on all morning.  He got me.  He bamboozled me.  He walks around with headphones on.  He bamboozled me.  Now, was I supposed to come in here and not know what you guys were talking about?  Yeah.  Don't just say what Anthony said. 
[02:00:00]  What's your perspective on this?  What do you got going on?  Just because he said...  Is this like an action movie to you?  Just because he said it on air first doesn't mean that I had it in my head first.  Did you really have it in your head?  Yes, I did, sir.  I got that.  Shut up, Sam.  Damn.  But what else you got on this?  Have you been following the action?  Yeah, of course I have.  Have you?  On the news?  Yeah.  So what's your thoughts?  What conclusions are you drawing on your own?  What do you got?  I don't think it's exciting.  It is exciting.  Regardless.  It's not good. 
[02:00:30]  It's a bad thing.  But it is exciting.  Yeah.  It's a pain in the ass that this is going on again.  It's exciting as all hell.  Of course it is.  It's impinging on a fucking lifestyle, man.  Something negative could be exciting as well.  It's what?  Impinging.  Impinging?  That's what's going on with my left shoulder.  I got an impingement happening.  Hey, sure.  Yeah, I'm going to have to either get an operation or a rehab.  Which you're saying it's impinging.  Impinging?  Yeah.  Like, I'm not my strong, smooth.  No, it's impinging. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, what does it mean?  It's a verb.  It's to impinge, to have an effect or impact.  Right.  All right.  And infringing is more like invasive.  Like to take away rights.  Yeah, kind of like what you're...  Oh.  Impinging is like, it's there.  Wait, what is impinging again?  It's just to have an effect on.  An effect.  And infringing is more of a negative connotation to it.  Like you're taking something.  Right.  Kind of like what Mars is doing to the show right now.  Like, Marge is definitely an impingement on the show.  He's an impingement.  Is it an impingement or an infringement for our show right now? 
[02:01:30]  I need to know.  He's infringing on our show.  He's infringing on the listeners' ability to enjoy the show.  Ability to enjoy the show.  Very good.  I gotcha.  Okay.  He's impinging on us.  Mars is a general impingement to the Yopi and Anthony show.  Am I really savvy?  I think so.  Oh, man.  Is she limping?  Yeah, she must have had a good time in Miami.  She's limping.  She's extra bull-legged.  But it's only one foot that's limping.  Just yell down the hall and go, yo, what's wrong with your foot?  Yo, Nicole. 
[02:02:00]  What's wrong with your foot?  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, she's hungover.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  She just told Sarah, go fuck herself.  She was really pissed.  Yeah?  She turned around.  She goes, in a gritty voice.  That guy, I forget his name, just pat her on the back like, you go, girl.  She's like, go fuck yourself.  What's wrong with her?  In her best Lucille Ball a month before she died voice.  I thought things were going well with her.  What happened?  Yeah, I don't know.  I can't take that seriously.  She looks like she's tired and maybe hungover or maybe still, you know. 
[02:02:30]  But how could she tell me to go fuck myself with my faces on her t-shirt?  I don't know.  She was limping, but she's limping.  So you didn't ask, like, what's wrong with your foot?  Like, you got big feet.  Right.  Like, I think she took that as the insult, like the Bigfoot insult.  Right.  We're not going with that right now.  No, we're going with the limp.  Right.  Should I clarify things and try to find out?  Yes.  Maybe it's vaginal.  Yes.  Approach.  Maybe it's vaginal.  Maybe it's anal.  She might be armed and dangerous, so look out.  She might be Chechenian.  Right.  Be very careful.  Yes. 
[02:03:00]  She's hiding bombs in her shoes.  Let's go.  Let's go around the dial again here.  The news dial.  Yes.  The entire city is left waiting.  Waiting indoors.  Waiting to find out when.  They can deem themselves safe.  With us now from Watertown, Massachusetts, NBC correspondent Katie Tourer.  She's right around the corner from where that shooting took place, the one we just showed  you on video.  Katie?  I just can't tell you how weird it is, Mika, to be out here and to not see anybody but the 
[02:03:30]  media.  We've, I've been covering news for quite a while, mostly in New York City.  You've got a radio show.  It seems like there's hostage situations, manhunts.  Doing a better job than you.  You're always getting people from the community coming and asking you what's going on, wanting  to get updates.  There's nobody out here but the press.  The streets are completely empty.  Just take a look down this street right here.  You're not seeing anybody moving.  It's 830 or so.  Once again, they are so far from the fucking action.  They're not even close to where the SWAT teams are.  No, you can tell.  Look, she's pointing us down two completely empty streets. 
[02:04:00]  That means they're pretty certain nothing is happening on those streets.  You know, they're being held pretty far back when they're being pushed away by Connecticut  state troopers.  Right.  It's like, okay, we can.  This is pretty far.  They like to think they're more special than the rest of us.  They're just not.  If you come from.  We could stand there.  Of course.  You could stand at the police barrier.  Anyone.  The police barrier.  The Humvees.  The red flag in my head. 
[02:04:30]  Like, okay, well.  Closing off the streets.  Something like that.  And, you know, the events that happened as originally, you know, would warrant something.  Like, you know, it would warrant something that has had an interest.  Nobody.  It doesn't really make sense.  And I don't want to, you know, point fingers.  But, I mean, it's a lot, man.  We all went to high school with him.  Like, you know, we would see him in the hallways.  And when he'd say hi to a kid that, you know, just a normal kid.  And to think that, you know, he's capable of something like this is beyond belief. 
[02:05:00]  It's got to be very difficult.  We're on the phone with Eric Machado right now, who was at high school.  A schoolmate at Cambridge in Latin with Zokar.  Zokar.  I am Zokar.  Oh, wait a minute.  I believe it is pronounced.  Jahar.  Jahar.  Why is that Jahar?  Do you have any concept for us?  As far as I know, that was his name.  I mean, we all addressed him as Jahar.  But, I mean, I can understand where the nickname is.  This kid on the phone doesn't know anything about the suspect. 
[02:05:30]  He just happened to walk the halls with the dead kid.  Hey, he said he went to school with him.  All right.  And two of which are in the line of fire.  One is.  We'll go back there, but he doesn't want to tell the bad.  That never really came up.  I mean, I came to the original Latin.  One of our slogans that actually my class implemented is diversity.  And we come from a very diverse school.  Great.  Diversity is wonderful, isn't it?  All walks of life.  I mean, from all parts of Asia.  God, I hate diversity.  Is she mad at you? 
[02:06:00]  She's really pissed, right?  All over.  I mean, there's kids that represent every nation in the country.  What happened?  I'm trying to get mad.  And, you know, so.  Oh, man.  More importantly, you guys, Nicole update?  Let's see if she's a wave to us.  Wait, open the door.  We'll try.  Okay.  I'm going to use my soft voice.  Nicole?  Nicole?  Nicole?  Nicole?  Can we just talk to you?  Look, look.  Oh, man.  My voice is shot, too.  Don't act like I got fucked in the ass, and that's why I'm fucking limping.  No, no, no.  I'm in the mood. 
[02:06:30]  What happened?  Nothing happened to my leg.  What's up with your voice?  I have laryngitis.  Why?  And I'm on the radio.  I know.  Why do you think this is so funny?  Do you know how badly I want to fucking punch you in the face?  I'll let you.  I'll let you punch me.  I'm in the same boat.  I can't talk.  Yeah.  I have a horrible.  Oh, you sound just fine.  No.  No, it's terrible.  I swear.  Nicole, what's going on?  Let's talk.  What happened?  My husband said last night, maybe if you give me a blowjob, it'll coat your throat. 
[02:07:00]  That's pretty good.  Did you try?  No, fuck him.  Oh, shit.  You seem fucked up, though, are you?  I'm not fucked up at all.  What happened to your leg, though?  You don't just wake up limping.  How am I limping?  We saw you kind of limping down the wall.  It looked like your leg hurt.  That's my swag.  That's my, like, thug walk.  Oh, okay.  It's like sister.  Where would you punch me?  Oh, this is fucking right between the eyes.  Really?  Wait, let's negotiate this.  I'll let you punch me.  You really would?  Yeah, where else would you punch me?  How about with the ring finger?  I liked your bikini picture. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah?  That was pretty good.  We did like that.  No, because I was down in Florida with...  How many days?  Just for a long weekend, but I was down with my husband, Rich, and Sarah, his wife, who,  if you look her up, is maybe the hottest human being on the face of the girl.  Really?  She's a bikini model, so I was like, great.  I mean, I don't think I'm fat, but I can't compare to her.  No, you look good.  Were guys jacking off to your picture?  Were they saying they were jacking off to it?  Yeah, I think guys still jack off to your pictures.  The intern was jerking off to you or something? 
[02:08:00]  Look at that.  Are you kidding me?  Are you smoking?  Yeah, why are you downplaying your bikini shot?  I'm not downplaying myself.  So Matt goes, we got to show him.  You're just as pretty, Sarah.  Go out there and pose.  I'm like, I am not going out there and posing for a picture.  And he's like, please, let's just do it.  We'll Instagram it.  And I'm like, so I literally was like...  You were doing all the...  Oh, you're sucking ant tricks?  I had to.  You're sucking in everything?  No way.  Who is that?  No, no.  I got a better one.  Rich's wife.  Go back.  What?  That she was in Florida with.  How does he rate that shit?  Oh, yeah.  What about these? 
[02:08:30]  The guy with the dead eyes is married to that?  Yeah.  Your autistic friend, Rich?  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  He is married to her.  So I had to lay...  How do you score that shit?  I had to lay next to her on the beach, and I fell fat.  Yeah, that would make anybody...  Wow.  They're pulling you out of here.  Oh, shit.  Take it easy.  Wow.  What the fuck?  They got pissed at her last time.  Why?  I don't know.  Apparently, they think that it's very valuable. 
[02:09:00]  Who gives a fuck?  Have they got enough guys to cover for a break?  I can't believe that.  Wait till it comes down from probably Kid Kelly that she can't be on our show anymore.  You watch.  It's coming.  Because know why?  It's working too well.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  She's better on this channel than she is on Hits One.  Yeah.  Yeah, Nicole's number drastically dropped hanging around with that broad.  She's fucking either hammered or coming off of...  I know, but she's not going to tell us. 
[02:09:30]  Coming off a high.  Something's up.  Miss Hooters International.  Something's up.  She's...  Wow, that chick is pretty fucking hot right there.  Got to give it to her.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want the Cuban in here?  He's yapping out there.  Bring the Cuban in.  He's yapping about.  Let's go...  Oh, breaking news.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Welcome back, everyone.  John Berman here, along with Jake Tapper.  We are following this amazing breaking news out of Boston, the entire area right now. 
[02:10:00]  Two big developments to tell you about.  This isn't breaking news.  First, the city of Boston right now...  They're taking advantage of the breaking news.  ...on lockdown.  No taxis.  No public transportation.  We just learned the airspace...  No planes.  ...is effectively shut down.  And we have some new information about the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings.  They're identified as brothers from Chechnya.  Jake, you do a better job of pronouncing it.  I'll let you do it.  I don't know about that.  Tamerlan Tsarnaev, age 26.  He is dead.  He is suspect number one. 
[02:10:30]  The one that was seen in the black hat in the photographs that the FBI released yesterday.  His younger brother, who's 19 years old, Jahar Tsarnaev, he is still at large.  This is still...  ...to everything we heard already.  ...to the Boston Police Department.  This is an image of the 19-year-old Joe Karzaria.  Teen terrorist.  The 19-year-old that they are now looking for.  I don't know if this is a recent image.  No.  Of course it's not.  That's a fucking image from, like, junior high. 
[02:11:00]  You're looking at a picture that looks like a sixth grader.  It's safe to say that's not a recent image.  That's using the fucking, what I call the Instagram Trayvon filter.  It takes fucking 10 years off of you.  ...Jokar Zadiav of Cambridge.  How can they say that, though?  Of course it's not a recent picture.  ...from the Boston Police Department a moment ago.  This is something that's fascinating to monitor and watch because what the town of Boston is...  Oh, God.  ...of the increased coordination...  ...look at all the fucking vehicles. 
[02:11:30]  ...emergency vehicles going down there.  Dude, this is a view.  You could get away with some shit in Boston today.  Oh, shit.  Look at the fucking parade.  It's a fuckload of vehicles.  I think it was a good day to shoplift in Boston.  No one's going to buy it.  No one's going to give a shit what you do.  Yeah, look at all those vehicles.  I don't know what road that is.  Boy, I might have to...  That's stock footage, too, by the way.  I might have to go with what the conspiracy theorists are going to be saying about this.  Yeah.  This is a... 
[02:12:00]  A false flag.  ...not a drill, but it's a good dry run, let's just say, of what it would take for the military  and the police and whatnot to literally close down a town, to sequester the people in their  homes and show a force and use fear to keep people, you know, down.  This is an amazing microcosm of martial law that we're seeing right here. 
[02:12:30]  Well, then, that's the little taste from Alex Jones that you wonder about.  Oh, yeah.  Let's imagine they already have the suspect.  Yeah.  But they're like, you know what?  We got all our guys out.  Let's just run this.  Why don't we just fucking do a nice drill that we're not allowed to do on a regular day?  So why don't we spend a few hours, like, just fucking...  See how it goes.  See how it goes.  Yeah.  That's when you do wonder about it.  Let's deploy.  The Cubans in studio.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Cubano.  By the way, no one has to tune us out here, because we're on it. 
[02:13:00]  We got like five fucking news channels.  By the second something breaks, we're on it.  We're on it.  Right now, the news cycle, they're just fucking rehashing the same old shit over and over and  over again, and they're all making believe they got something that the rest of them don't.  Yeah.  Well, that's where we're at.  Pursuit.  Hold on.  So just one squad, the last three vehicles.  You guys hold for another one, okay?  Hold for another one.  They get plenty of options to say.  Just be on standby.  Yanky C9, some officers stay on Dexter in case they try to double back. 
[02:13:30]  All right, some of those officers stay on Dexter.  Yeah, nobody's over there so bad.  Guys, somebody get back there, please.  Yanky C3, we've got plenty of help down here.  We don't need anyone else.  I think there's a foot pursuit going on.  Down there at Dexter, Willow Park.  You've got plenty of help there.  Willow Park foot pursuit.  Stay in your zone.  Stay in your zone.  Yanky C4, you got it.  You're on it.  Yanky C9, I'm here too. 
[02:14:00]  Guys, get behind cover.  Not consuming.  Cover.  Ooh.  The units get behind cover again.  Warning.  Unit of caution and approach.  The trigger was found on the party that is currently at the morgue.  Use caution.  Possibility of a suicide death.  A trigger was found on the party that is currently at the morgue?  No concealment.  So...  Sorry, boys, again, take cover.  No concealment.  Cover.  No concealment.  Cover.  We caught into the DCU. 
[02:14:30]  Your emergency signal is going off.  Are you okay?  Uh-oh.  There you go.  Whoa.  Something's up.  They can't just approach somebody.  He might explode. 
[02:15:00]  Yankee C3, can we just start a tactical team down here, please?  Jet, 905, we're rolling.  A couple units to hang back.  Turn chase, he doubles back.  So they...  Angle Alpha 2.  They're apparently foot chase.  Angle Alpha 2 and L.  Angle Alpha 2.  It's got an EOD team. 
[02:15:30]  EOD team.  You need an EOD team down there, Dexter and Willow Park.  Where's Willow Park?  Angle 9-11, let's send to somebody.  Santa, could you find Willow Park?  Google map that shit.  Find Willow Park.  Angle 5-11, I'm still here.  I'll be responding.  Okay, so you're on the way.  Okay.  Angle Alpha 2.  Angle Alpha 2. 
[02:16:00]  You confirm the last location of the suspect.  We're coming for the suspect.  Okay.  It's a Yankee C3.  It's in Watertown.  It's in Watertown.  I'm calling to him, sir.  Yeah, we're inquiring.  Who's the last officer to see this?  This is sweet.  There's a Jolly Supervisor that called off on the foot chase.  Where's the Jolly 903?  What are you?  We're checking the cellar basement open door down here at 33 Quincy. 
[02:16:30]  At 33 Quincy, checking an open door in the cellar there.  Open cellar door.  Open the armor over there at the Metro-Lex team.  Throw in a grenade.  Harry 905.  20.  Is, uh, the back door is open as well.  Back door is open now.  Level the house.  I'm just above there.  Okay, sir.  992.  The IDP3.  Sir, there are three up-armament companies. 
[02:17:00]  You know, the way to Willow Park for cover.  I guess, uh, Fox News has a shadow of the middle part.  They're trained on this building.  So this may be a neighbor that they wanted to get out into safety who came out first.  Uh, but clearly they're still very trained on this building.  Oh.  The scanner's better.  Yeah.  Yes, she doesn't know anything.  No, she doesn't know shit.  Bravo, Charlie 1.  Yeah, there's officers from all over flooding in there.  We gotta get some discipline.  We gotta hold the perimeter.  And in case it's not him, we gotta hold the other area. 
[02:17:30]  Holy fuck.  You know, we don't need any more help.  We always do so that's, you know, the tactical game down here.  They're serious.  99.  Guys, stay up to you.  Thank you, 59.  1, 4, 5.  We're at Willow.  We're looking at number 1715.  We have a bear with us.  Have officers holding the perimeter.  What I need is officers holding the perimeter on Dexter as well.  Everybody behind cover.  So right now, currently, it's number 1715. 
[02:18:00]  And we have evacuated some civilians from that.  We have all agencies here.  I-15 and 17 Willow.  Citizens have been evacuated.  You're looking at the open doors there.  You want the resources to hang back, grab cover.  Officers stand by on Dexter in case he doubles back.  I-15 and I, we are not sending our guys in.  We're waiting for tactical.  Once again, we have a frontier here.  And we have tactical officers in the back.  Once again, our parallel three will be Dexter three. 
[02:18:30]  So I want guys over there.  I want guys to cover in case they double back.  There's the last stomp.  There's some pretty shit right here.  We have media members running around in the, uh, in the complex there.  If somebody could grab and get them out of there.  All right, we need to move the media back.  Do not restrict your mics now.  Open mic.  Fucking media.  All right, I guess they got through after all.  Check the open mic. 
[02:19:00]  Open mic on the channel.  I'm assuming it's every star.  It's on area wide floor.  An area wide floor.  Sounds like they need Denny there.  Uh, there's an open mic.  Someone has an open mic.  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  There's a hot mic.  Yeah, he's great.  Yes, the Charlie supervisor was the last to call off on this.  Is he on the air?  Shall we name it on the floor?  Yeah, where is the last, the last time you've seen him?  What's the exact location? 
[02:19:30]  There was a radio call in from Watertown.  He was behind 25.  He was walking over towards 1715.  A man with a black hoodie.  A man with a black hoodie.  Okay, got it.  Closing the noose.  All right, I don't.  So we're, we're at 78 extra.  He's in the yellow house.  The house on Quincy is a gray house.  That gray house had a motion light gone on about a minute ago on the back. 
[02:20:00]  Motion light went on.  78 extra.  You're looking at a yellow house in back or the motion light just went on there?  The house on Quincy.  The house opposite.  The yellow house.  The yellow house is on Dexter.  Light it up.  Light it up.  I would just start shooting indiscriminately.  Yeah.  I figured that out at the beginning of the show.  Right.  This is getting exciting.  Can we get a ramp up to Oak Street?  A ramp up to Oak Street? 
[02:20:30]  A ramp?  Oh, they're going with the ramp.  Oh, yeah.  Get a ramp.  Knock the door down and throw it a grenade.  Knock the goddamn door down.  I got cookies in the oven.  I would go in like Call of Duty with a knife. 
[02:21:00]  Just knifing.  We don't want him to jump to the other house, obviously.  Keep an eye out.  Keep an eye open.  Keep cover.  Look at the dumb fucking media.  How horrible is MSNBC?  They don't have a shot at the house.  Wait, let's see what they got. 
[02:21:30]  That's terrible.  Real fast.  They escaped, eluded law enforcement authorities after a shootout in Watertown in the dark of  night.  They have to.  Still reiterating.  Yeah, nothing I know.  They are moving you back from that scene.  Are police giving you any indication of what kind of activity is going on?  Um, no, no, they're not.  They're not.  She doesn't know.  19, Joe Carzaria.  She has no idea if this is happening.  Griff Jenkins has followed this as well.  Yankee C3, we have enough assets here now, okay? 
[02:22:00]  We're all set as far as tactical goal.  We're going to clear this house.  And then, Willie, we'll move over there if we have no idea, okay?  Yes, sir.  I'm trying to move my guys to our proper cover to make sure we're out of the front of these  houses.  Keep an eye on 272.  They sure want to be positive their guys aren't on a fire line.  All the tactical commanders run your zone.  Tactical sports.  Stay in your limit.  Who are the crazy motherfuckers going to go in there? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, man.  We're still having 18 to 20 Oak Street.  Flash bang.  Flash bang.  Sticky bomb.  Throw in a sticky bomb.  Willie, we'll move over to help you there.  Get 10 kills and then send in the remote RC car with the explosive on it.  What number are you at? 
[02:23:00]  So, what house are you at?  House?  Yeah, you can see.  Can we get the one back?  Yeah, can we get EOD here, please?  EOD.  Are you bomb guys?  10-11-1, 9-12, and then 9-11 on the way.  Just send it in the bomb guys.  Oh, they're getting bomb guys over there.  Holy shit.  This could be the guy's fucking last stand-up. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, yeah, we got reports.  There might be something nice.  We have a report, sir.  Yeah, 10-9-11, 10-9-12 responding.  Oral or no?  I don't want to control.  Helicopter hovering over the place.  Whoever else is on Franklin and Center Street. 
[02:24:00]  We'll finish sweeping this last area right here.  Wow.  Guys taking cover behind the Humvees.  More of that yellow get-the-fuck-out-of-here tape is going up.  We want all the tech teams to remain around the perimeter of this house.  It looks like we got some type of rocket or something in the basement here.  We need to go...  A what?  Did he say a rocket?  I thought he said a rocket.  We got some kind of rocket in the basement? 
[02:24:30]  We have a second floor window of number 27.  The red blanket or something.  Somebody keeps looking out of that.  So, yep, it's, uh, we got 27-29.  The White House.  Allah-wakba!  Allah-wakba!  Allah-wakba!  We're going into this house here, okay?  But they're not going into the house, right?  I don't think so.  Twitter's saying there's a guy in a dark hoodie that's running from yard to yard. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  So that's probably the black hoodie they were referencing.  Yeah, evacuated.  Can we stay off the air and deal with one house at a time here?  All right, we're dealing with 18 to 20 over.  All right, really fast then?  All right.  We're murdering anybody in their path.  Uh, so, again, an unprecedented, uh, sense of terror in the Boston area.  Nothing.  With the neighbor.  And so you got a knock on the door this morning.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Law enforcement, uh, and authorities, uh, we don't want to make that, uh, make that jump. 
[02:25:30]  But they're, they're getting briefed about behind the scenes as we look at this stand.  Nothing.  They really don't have any information.  Why wouldn't they just fucking...  That we're getting right here.  You don't have to play the police scanner, but at least tell the people what the police  scanner's saying.  It's that same house it looks like, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a house.  It's like a small, small apartment.  Yeah, it looks like a big apartment building.  Yeah, one, two, six. 
[02:26:00]  There's the yellow house.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's right.  A rocket in the basement?  What the fuck is that?  We gotta get the bomb guys over there.  6-0.  6-0.  Yeah.  6-0.  Yellow.  Come in, Johnny. 
[02:26:30]  It's over, Johnny.  I've got a rocket in my house.  Damn. 
[02:27:00]  Dragonfly to Wolf's Den.  Colorful names.  Now what?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Would they go silent if shit was going down, or what?  I don't know.  Sometimes they go to their tactical channels, I think.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  Cruising Mount Auburn at Walnut.  10-50.  So what exciting stuff happened to you around?  That white.  Turn him around.  Just keep him down that way.  Hook the left right before he got to the other side street.  Oh.  Well, we go back here.  Stories of terror, and even some casualties, and injuries. 
[02:28:00]  These two suspects meant to hurt people.  They meant to hurt people.  Really?  He was headed to this scene with them.  As we talk about this connection, and this, you know, sort of unique...  Hello?  Steve?  Hello?  Uh...  Hello?  Trooper Augusta, the CP.  It's Cypress and Laurel. 
[02:28:30]  CP is ongoing, Trooper Augusta.  25 or 30 people that have just been dislodged in the heart of the attention zone.  Can you even get these people out of here with the bus?  Dislodged.  Wow.  I guess civilians that have been there...  Busting them out of the area.  Yeah, yeah.  Tangle off a one.  Obviously, another false flag situation.  Do we have anyone who saw the person run into any of these houses? 
[02:29:00]  Did anybody get a clear visual of him running into a home?  No.  Wendry.  Anyone?  Sounds like they got it down to about three houses, right?  Yeah.  Possibly one.  Yeah.  2-2 Bravo.  3-2 Alpha. 
[02:29:30]  2-3 Bravo.  Over.  I'm on a job where you just say cool things like that.  I know, right?  3-2 Bravo.  E-Rock.  3-2 Bravo.  3-2 Bravo, E-Rock.  Sal, 32 faggot.  What?  Second level, he said.  Oh, shit.  That unit, where are you? 
[02:30:00]  Shoot him!  What's second level?  I don't know.  Probably the second level of that house they were showing.  I don't know how quick the permit was set up around the target location right now.  However, the building just to the rear of it in between there and Oshenol Street.  It's 480 Oshenol Street.  Be advised, those doors, big large building with satellites on top.  There was an occupant in there.  There was an occupant in there.  The doors were open.  He, when he saw me, he went back into the building.  He had a white backpack and a gray-colored jacket of some sort. 
[02:30:30]  Looked like with a hood zip in front.  A backpack.  Holy shit.  Someone's got a backpack.  Check the closet.  Check the closet.  Check the closet.  It's going to be outside the perimeter, sir.  It's the large industrial building here.  Just be advised by the airwink.  It's also known that we're going from the target location towards the Arsenal Mall.  What the hell's going on? 
[02:31:00]  It's going to the mall.  Well, what's going on is Roland just tweeted, the milk truck has arrived.  Oh, shit.  That's important.  They better wrap this up before 10 o'clock.  This is the industrial park directly to your rear.  You should have a permit of service.  Ah, fuck you and your rear.  I sent you a canine and he was to respond to you.  This is crazy.  Damn. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  We've got a Dunkin' Donuts in this, man.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I don't know.  Tango 911, just let the EOD come in know that those people on the unit will be Waro at Cypress Street.  Come in.  We have that Waro Cypress.  We got it.  Three, two, one, Alpha Tango Fatso.  Alpha Tango Fatso.  Three, two, slobber.  Can we get a 32, Alpha Useless down here from down the hall? 
[02:32:00]  32, Alpha Useless.  He's been off all week.  Oh, shit.  He's missing.  He's MIA.  Three, two, Baldy.  Come in.  Three, two, Baldy.  Three, two, Baldy.  Useless.  Alpha.  With me, if you could just leave him off to my log. 
[02:32:30]  Ten, two, window, please.  Three, three minutes, window.  By the way, you've got to hold back Ronnie.  I'm sorry.  We're not bringing Ronnie in the middle of this.  Why?  From the Jersey Shore.  Oh, shit.  You don't think now's the time to push Smush Cocktails?  No, I don't think so.  Smush Cocktails.  We're about to get a Smush.  I believe it was northbound in the area of the Plasma. 
[02:33:00]  No work order scheduled.  He's now down to the Plasma, I think.  You can see if you can stop and identify an individual.  What happened to the rocket in the basement?  Yeah, no kidding.  We did hear that, right?  Yeah.  It wasn't a foot chase.  We were notified that there was someone running in the backyard back there with a black hoodie.  All right.  It wasn't a foot chase.  They were notified of someone running in the backyard with a hoodie. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  Those hoodies are just fucking, just do away with them.  I don't know what I'm doing wearing this today.  What are you fucking doing?  Look at you.  It's a black hoodie.  Black hoodie.  It's so spouting.  Nothing but trouble, those hoodies. 
[02:34:00]  Central.  Go ahead, ma'am.  Should you pick up a trampoline?  On the way to 100 East Canton Street, check for an unattended package left in the lobby.  It's a brown box wrapped in tape.  Brown blocks.  Black.  Black.  Well, why don't you go to Roxbury or Dorchester to find a brown box, if you know what I fucking mean.  I can't see you again.  We're on the way here at 18 to 20 Oak Street here.  All right.  We're ready to search the third floor here.  Copy that. 
[02:34:30]  Yes, we have that.  On to another.  Copy.  On to another, ma'am.  And again, Menino, not even a fucking issue during this whole thing.  Right.  You know?  Can you imagine him trying to pronounce suspect number two's name? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  He'll have a stroke.  It says on the TV that there are two people in custody of the house where the brothers lived.  Oh, that's just roommates.  That's roommates shit.  Yeah.  What happened? 
[02:35:30]  It's like a TV show that leaves a lot of loose ends.  Mm-hmm.  You like watch the show, and then you go, what happened to that rocket in the basement?  What happened to the door ram that they were getting?  What about that suspicious package?  This is like fucking lost.  Willow House.  What happened to Furio? 
[02:36:00]  What about the Russian guy that was lost in the woods?  What about Dr. Melfi's rate?  We can get as fast as possible, and then stay up as long as we can.  I'm kind of surprised to see you, quite frankly.  No worries.  Okay, we're probably about five minutes out.  Five minutes out?  Who?  I don't know.  Maybe SWAT?  Yeah, they're busy maybe clearing another house. 
[02:36:30]  SWAT.  Let's go, Dano.  Okay, I have the MBCA bus.  Can you bring him up Dexter to Mount Aubin?  Mount Aubin.  Let's all go to the bar in Peabody.  I know a nice bar in Peabody. 
[02:37:00]  Fucking, I think Roland tweeted again.  Government center, radio check over.  Milk truck is cooking their amazing grilled cheese for us now.  Thank God we're getting updates on two of the big stories today.  Fucking Roland.  You may have heard about Boston and what's happening in Watertown.  Right.  One terrorist.  Close it in on suspect number two.  Suspect number two.  But all Roland cares about is that our grilled cheese. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  Our other big story.  The truck is out front with grilled cheese.  We have a photo of the truck.  Do we have confirmation that the truck is here?  The milkshake maker is in the truck.  Oh, good.  Repeat that, sir.  Uh-oh, repeat.  Sir, he is posting online.  No, he is posting online.  I will kill all of you as you kill my brother.  He's posting online.  I will get all of you.  You killed my brother?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  This is some good shit. 
[02:38:00]  I can't tell you what we're going to be able to see until I take a look.  Who's fucking posting that?  This is Jeremy.  Mike was on the other line.  He's going to get a lot of followers.  Thanks, Jeremy.  You dirty rat.  You killed my brother.  Yeah.  Shit's getting serious.  Yeah, it is.  How is he charging his phone? 
[02:38:30]  Yankee C-11.  Can you go to channel 7?  Aw, man.  That can't be good for us.  Fuck.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Open mic.  You're in command.  Go ahead.  Any information you can relate to us? 
[02:39:00]  Unknown at this time.  It came from a Watertown detective.  We're off now.  There is a SWAT team that's got a house surrounded at this time.  Unknown if it's a device at this time.  Unknown if it's a device at this time?  We get a chance to give it the address.  Also, we've dispatched some units to 4E Arsenal Street.  Whenever we're on the cover off of the theater, so it's a subject. 
[02:39:30]  Kind of sitting with a description with a white backpack and ran back into the building.  We have a SWAT unit and a perimeter unit that's down there.  If they find something, it might need you to take it back.  Damn.  Have a CB.  CB's on, Sean.  Would I throw a lighted match in this stuff if my friend Demacia Gosslidge was in here?  All right, rabbit. 
[02:40:00]  I'll look for Demarga Gondiswag and I'm in the city.  The information is about approximately 7 hours old.  We have the residents who have already left that residence.  They left the house.  And Boston's going to go in and just do a cursory search and clear it.  See, 15 to 17.  Sorry, that's on the corner of Willow Park.  Okay, Quimby or Willow Park.  Also, could you have someone reach out to Boston PD Intel? 
[02:40:30]  They have some current intel regarding internet.  Yes, we heard that.  Come on, you're telling me.  I killed a CB.  I'm with a Boston PD.  Just came over there, radio.  The subject is posting online.  He's going to kill everyone because we killed his brother.  Man, is he out of touch with reality.  He's all pissed because they killed his brother.  Wow.  Guys, I'm not sure if they gave you the correct address.  480, Arsenal, 480. 
[02:41:00]  It's going to be the, it appears that there's some police officers up on top at this point of the building.  I have one of the sides covered as well as one of the uniforms.  The exits.  It could be the cleaning crew.  It appears there's a cleaning crew in here.  A cleaning crew.  It's my fucking job.  Goodness gracious.  What do you think?  We're on the Alpha Delta corner of the Nessin offices. 
[02:41:30]  The sign is Cernia Pharmaceuticals.  D-I-C-E-R-N-A Pharmaceuticals.  The rim, the Charlie Delta side of the building backs up to where...  Charlie Delta side of the building.  Jesus.  I believe it's in that neighborhood.  They're all on the streets behind me.  They were separated by a squad center. 
[02:42:00]  How long is that?  The Cernia was just cleared.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Do you believe to Boston, please, on Bayview Central?  Where is that guy posting stuff, I wonder?  That's what I want to find out.  We're trying to find out.  We'll have it.  Please, on the building on the second floor.  Yeah.  Milk truck is downstairs. 
[02:42:30]  Do we have confirmation?  Yes.  We have confirmation.  Sir, what address is it?  69 Alton.  The milk truck is indeed downstairs.  It's on the Charlie Delta side of the building.  We do have a milk truck.  If we could send a Roland down there and set up a CP.  We're also getting information about some Internet postings of grilled cheese sandwiches. 
[02:43:00]  And again, confirmation of the milk truck is outside the building.  This is a gentleman that was up around the corner taking pictures.  And he ducked into the house as soon as we secure the area.  Mom.  Fly over and get a better vantage point.  But they now have a layer above us.  So this is the best we can do.  That's the helicopter.  Yes, I hear it. 
[02:43:30]  Helicopter.  The Yankee C3, can you let us know, ASAP, if you don't need us?  Because then we'll move over to where the Yankee C9 is.  Yankees?  Crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just move in.  Willy nilly.  Okay.  Rush the door.  I found where he's posting, but I don't know that it's really him. 
[02:44:00]  It was a Twitter account that was probably an hour ago.  An hour ago?  Yeah.  With the same picture that's been everywhere.  Ah, so they're probably being tricked.  Yeah, there's probably a hoax.  They're probably being tricked.  They've got to look at every lead, but, I mean.  Wait, what is your account?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, no, that's someone online also saying that's the, uh.  Probably offline.  What do you mean offline?  I don't know.  It kind of petered out a second here.  All right, we'll get it back. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, this is where it says, I will kill you all as you killed my brother.  Yeah, but that could be a fake Twitter account.  Why are they falling for that?  Some troll.  It looks fake.  Oh, boy.  I hate you.  Yeah, he's following one account, and it's the Boston Police Department.  Oh, right.  He's got seven tweets, and they started an hour ago.  Just following.  How the fuck did he get time to start a Twitter account?  Really?  Right.  He's fucking hunkered down in a place, and he's starting Twitter accounts.  Goddamn, Wi-Fi doesn't work.  He's following the Boston Police Department and Colin Quinn.  Right. 
[02:45:00]  Because he thinks he's hilarious.  Well, what are the tweets, the seven tweets from this site that it looks like they're referencing  on the police scatter?  He tweets at.  Roll through them real fast.  Go.  At the Boston Police, I will kill you all as you killed my brother.  And then he writes, I will kill you all as you killed my brother.  And then he writes, Joker Tazerniff will kill you at Boston Police.  And then he's just writing the same thing, I will kill you all as you killed my brother.  Is he getting followers?  He's got 368 followers.  Refresh.  Let's see what it's at now.  Pretty quick. 
[02:45:30]  814.  Wow!  I believe we have to cross over several feet to get there.  We're trying to find a way to get a bus close enough to you and still be able to get the  bus out.  And the news is still not reporting.  To me, I would say yeah, but it's not my money.  We're right on top of things, people.  Stay with us.  All day.  All night.  I guess they have to look at everything, even if it's a hoax, obviously. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  It's like, well, we've got to look into this.  See what the fuck.  I mean, a minute ago they had a battering ram coming.  Yeah.  What happened to the battering ram?  Yeah, look at that. 
[02:46:30]  What happened?  The fucking Twitter account.  The guy is now saying that Opie and Anthony were much funnier at NEW.  So it's obviously, obviously a hoax.  Hater.  The number to UCC.  5433. 
[02:47:00]  Hmm.  Wow.  Let them eat static.  Oh.  Make that 242 Boylston.  Make that 242 Boylston.  242 Boylston.  Negative.  Negative. 
[02:47:30]  I think there's going to be a twist in this whole thing.  I don't know.  Other people involved or something.  Well, they'll...  Or do you think it's just these two guys.  I'm sure they're searching everywhere these motherfuckers have been.  Right.  For quite some time.  And, um...  Looks like there's a little break in the action.  Let's go see what the news is doing real fast.  Yeah.  Of Watertown.  As Mike Barnacle described it for us this morning.  A bedroom community of about 32,000 people.  And there was a shootout in the street.  Oh, my God.  In pursuit of these two individuals, there was a shootout. 
[02:48:00]  The older brother who was...  Oh, my God.  See, they're in downtown.  We don't know at this point.  But no doubt the police will be wanting to speak to them as well.  And really, one of the biggest questions that remains right now is, where is Joe Carr?  We know!  We pretty much know.  No, we kind of know.  We got it narrowed down to, like, three houses.  Right.  I think it's down to three.  By police, that there was shrapnel found in the body.  Why are they still reporting the news like this?  They're still reporting.  You go to Reddit. 
[02:48:30]  Well, you go to us a little bit, because we've got the police scanner.  You just go on Twitter in general, and you get way more info than these dummies.  You think you'd want first-hand information as to what the police are doing and no, and whatever.  Right.  And you can quickly figure out that that's a fake Twitter account, but, you know...  Well, they're running.  Live footage here.  Look at that guy.  That guy isn't running.  The older brother was run over by his younger brother.  In any case, he is dead.  The younger brother, Jahar, 19 years old.  He and his older brother both from...  Nothing.  Nothing.  And that's just stock footage. 
[02:49:00]  And you think...  They go with the B-roll still.  You think you watch the news because they give you the confirmation, like when it's on  the news, it's official?  Right.  But they blew that up earlier this week by reporting some bullshit.  Right.  Yep.  So that's...  They don't even have that anymore.  Yeah, they can't...  They've used up their mulligan.  Right.  Their fake news mulligan.  Look at her.  She's in fucking...  She's in Providence.  Let's go to her.  One of the newscasters.  26-year-old.  He had explosives on him.  We are told that those explosives did detonate. 
[02:49:30]  That's potentially likely what killed him.  You reported that he was run over by a car, possibly.  He was shot, blown up, and run over by a car.  Win!  That's exactly what happens in Boston.  Fuck him!  Run him over with the car!  You know, it's going to be some old broad with a frying pan that takes him out.  Yeah.  He ran through my goddamn backyard!  911?  Yeah.  I got the car, sucker. 
[02:50:00]  He was running through my azaleas in my fucking yard, and I hit him with my frying pan.  Actually, it's pretty ironic, considering you kill people with a goddamn cooking utensil.  Oh, my God.  They got to wrap this up by 10.  I know, right?  We don't want to go late on a Friday.  Are you kidding me?  All right, what do we got? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Anything on the police?  Back to police.  You check that.  I'll check Twitter.  We're all over this.  We are.  OP Radio.  Anthony Comia.  Of course.  Not Sam.  Not Sam.  Oh, not Sam.  It's Logan.  P-A-C-T-A-C.  Hello?  People are asking, what about the fucking milk truck?  Oh, shit.  The milk truck. 
[02:51:00]  What about the milk truck?  Can we release Corby Street between Dexter and Wall?  Can we release Corby Street between Dexter and Wall?  Dejection.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get back to the scanner if they get anything good going.  Well, the word's getting out that we got good coverage, man. 
[02:51:30]  People are fucking tuning in like crazy.  Oh, well, hello, everybody.  Well, hi to our new listeners.  You're just joining us.  We are right on the cutting edge of this breaking, very fluid news story.  Because we're not stupid.  We know where all this shit is.  Well, don't go crazy now.  It's on the police scanner.  It's on Twitter.  It's on Reddit.  Not on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News.  They're way the fuck behind.  That's what you do.  They're so far behind on this. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Maybe because to them, it's like, it would be nonsense to listen in on a police scanner.  But I think it's riveting as all hell.  It's their old school tactics of reporting.  They want to get the stories themselves.  So they send their reporters out there.  And, you know, I'm going to go through my sources and try to get this guy.  It's like, fuck it.  But we got this.  There's excitement.  And then we turn on, I think it was CNN, and there's a lady with bird noises.  Right.  She's so far away from the action.  She's so far away.  I saw a palm tree. 
[02:52:30]  She was giving a story from under a palm tree.  Jesus.  Look.  Because they have that bearcat vehicle you see.  You have the tactical agents or police officers that are in helmet.  They're basically telling you the SWAT team is there.  Yeah.  We've been listening to that interview there out of Maryland where another uncle.  So we're listening to a press conference right now.  A man who is said to be the uncle of the suspects.  His name is Ruslan. 
[02:53:00]  Ruslan.  Ruslan, the uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers.  The Tsarnaev brothers, as we know, are the two suspects in the Boston Marathon terrorist  attacks.  The older one, 26-year-old Tamerlan.  20 employees are getting ready to leave.  They've got to walk them out.  All of the staff that's working inside the...  How inconvenient.  Yeah, what a big ass.  What are the ugly asses?  An intense manhunt going on here in Boston.  They probably didn't understand the language of the newscast.  They don't know what's going on.  They've been told to stay in their homes. 
[02:53:30]  Thank you, I'm Roger.  I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  Okay, you want your officers to remain behind cover.  You're going to come over to Sergeant or Hearns' position.  Sergeant Hearns?  Yankee C-3.  Yeah.  Yeah.  7.  7.  7.  7.  7.  7.  7.  7.  8.  8.  8.  8.  9.  8.  9.  9.  9.  9. 
[02:54:00]  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  The police department just tweeted,  uh, warning, do not compromise officer safety by broadcasting tactical positions  of homes being searched.  All right.  Okay.  We'll do that.  We're going to check out this house.  Um, but can, is Yankee C2 monitoring?  I've got to assume he's not listening to the opening anthony show. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, Chief, I seem to think we're all set up here.  You know, we're just getting a lot of residents running in and out of their houses.  I don't want to disrupt what you've got going on.  So, you know, this appears to be a negative right now, okay?  Appears to be a negative.  On what?  On the house.  Get the battering ram out anyway, you know?  Yeah, get the ram out.  What, on that whole thing?  Well, on whatever he was looking at.  Oh, yeah, yeah, no.  At that point.  Let's make some fucking TV.  You got it on in the background, right?  Yeah.  All right, we should probably take a break. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, let's take a break.  Don't go anywhere.  We are your Boston terrorist Chechenian bombs, grenades, rockets.  Milk truck.  Milk truck headquarters.  Yes.  And someone's trying to point me to a YouTube account saying I couldn't contact you quickly,  but the guy killed overnight in Boston posted a video on Al-Qaeda's prophecy on YouTube previously. 
[02:55:30]  So this was an older video.  I wonder if we'll get that link after the break.  All right?  I'm not teasing.  I just don't.  The YouTubes.  Yeah, we've got to go back to the YouTubes.  Well, there's a bunch of fake Twitter accounts going on with that guy's name.  The suspect number two.  He appears to have created over a dozen Twitter accounts.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  After the break, Roland is going to attempt to pronounce suspect number two's name.  And?  We're going to say hi to the milk truck.  Yeah.  And?  Back to the police scanner, obviously. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  We've got to take a very quick break to fucking pee and catch up on things.  And do a live read for Mother's Day.  Jesus.  A few of them.  A few of them.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back very, very quickly.  Matter of fact, if something really crazy is going on, we're just going to jump right  back on it.  We promise you that.  The Open Anthony Show.  The Open Anthony Show.  The Open Anthony Show.  The Serious Exile.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  Where are we?  Well, unfortunately.  It's kind of a waiting game right now.  Scanner Feet's down.  Uh-oh.  I know.  That's our window to the world out there.  I have two separate scanner apps.  Let me check this one.  Well, as you do that, this is coming in.  They've got a couple guys at the, oh, wait, wait, a police source saying. 
[02:57:00]  Police horse?  Police horse saying.  Wow.  Two Russian nationals pulled over in Niagara Falls.  Four suspicious backpacks in the car.  Robot and bomb techs on scene.  Suspicious backpacks.  Russian nationals.  I bet it's nothing.  They never know.  I have a feeling there's more people involved.  You think?  Sure.  I don't know.  These two brothers?  Two brothers and maybe some others.  I don't know.  Damn that rhyme. 
[02:57:30]  Where the fuck is the milk truck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get on that story.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  We've got a break in the action.  We can get a quick grilled cheese sandwich in and a milkshake.  We have had confirmation.  It's just like the battering ram.  Yeah.  Confirmation that it's there, but.  All right.  Let's see what the traditional news is reporting.  Boring.  Six to ten Watertown police department vehicles.  And while they were engaging in gunfire, they were also using explosives. 
[02:58:00]  At that point, one of the shooters ran towards the officers while still engaging in gunfire.  And while he was still shooting at them, a few seconds later, the second shooter got  back into the SUV and turned it around and went full speed into the police officers.  Jesus.  Then bullets went through Kitsenberg's wall and into his apartment.  He took pictures of the bullet holes in his roommate's chair during the chase.  And he put it on Facebook. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  I saw that.  And he got 800 dislikes.  This sucks.  These bullet holes stink.  Yawn.  Oh, really?  Zee.  How do we know they're bullet holes?  I could poke a hole in my chair.  Look, and he shot me, too.  All you need is a screwdriver.  Fake.  Totally fake.  Fake.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  Epic fail. 
[02:59:00]  If it matches any of the suspect or anything that they have on file from the original police  scenes this morning.  Really?  You got a hole in your chair?  Did you chip?  What?  They're asking people to.  Here's the doctor.  We spent about 10, 15 minutes trying to resuscitate this patient.  Suspect number one who's dead.  Procedures being done that were unsuccessful and at 1.35 in the morning.  Yeah, but did he really try? 
[02:59:30]  Obviously, they're not going to try.  He's on the run, ran over his brother Tamerlan in that and essentially killed him.  Again, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has since suspended transit in Boston.  He's asking residents to stay.  He's being brought into the area where we are, guys.  All right, Don.  Don, thank you very much.  He's showing some pretty young pictures of this guy.  I find it amazing, though.  What he's talking about is matching what we've heard from the few people we've heard from  so far that especially the younger kid but also the older brother, at least for a while, 
[03:00:00]  appeared to be quote-unquote normal, appeared to be successful.  Wrestling scholarship for Jahar, the younger one.  Quiet, perhaps, but a normal kid.  And then something happened.  It's figuring out that something.  And we've also talked about the concern right now.  The reason the lockdown we've been reporting is because they're concerned that Jahar,  the younger brother who's on the run, could have explosives on him as the older brother  did last night.  That's part of the reason that they're very uncertain in asking people to stay inside.  I want to go to Joe John.  By the way, they're reporting all this from Copley Square.  From Copley Square. 
[03:00:30]  This can all end.  You know, the city of Boston's been through a lot.  But, you know, if there's one city that can get through this, it's us.  Oh, is that it?  Really?  One city?  Every other city would fall apart under the pressure?  Can I just reiterate the fact that...  I know what you're going to say, too.  I love that that's what people say, but it's bullshit.  You know, can we just...  There's not a city in America that's going to fall apart under these circumstances.  Yeah.  They're all going to fucking rally.  I'd like to bring up a fact that two airliners crashed into two of the biggest buildings 
[03:01:00]  in New York City, and they fell down.  The crime scene was a city.  Uh, yeah.  I think you'll pull through.  Everyone fucking gets together.  Everyone.  No matter what kind of tragedy it is.  It's tragic and everything.  Everyone knows it.  Any loss of life and the injuries that happen and stuff.  It's terrible.  But, you know.  Jesus.  Let's keep this in perspective.  For fuck's sake.  Uh, well, uh, this just in. 
[03:01:30]  The media has now been pushed back all the way to Iowa to report on the front page.  Iowa?  Yes.  Thank you, Steven.  Wow.  Oh, seven, one, four, three, six on the Twitter.  They're now in Iowa.  Damn.  The police tape is back to Iowa.  Yes.  Well, good luck to them.  I hope they can get a good shot.  He doesn't want to give up his location, but we, uh...  Oh.  We got Jack Bauer on the line here.  Oh.  Uh, Jack.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Uh, this first guy ain't dead. 
[03:02:00]  I'm telling you, he's not dead.  Until they drag his body out, he's not dead.  They're trying to draw his brother out.  Well, I heard there are pictures of him dead.  They're not going to show him.  And he was buried at sea.  Oh, really?  Yes, that's what I heard.  You don't think the guy's dead?  He is not dead.  Oh.  How do you know?  I can't tell you.  Oh, he's Jack Bauer, Opie.  Come on.  Jack Bauer, he can't tell you.  All right, fair enough.  He could call a radio show and say that, but... 
[03:02:30]  I was trying to trick him.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'll tell you how Alex Jones told me.  All right.  All right.  False flag.  You know, anyone that thinks this guy is dead at this point, you're crazy.  This just in from one of the suspects.  Well, the suspect's father, yes, because they're brothers.  I quote, and this is truly from the father.  It's on the AP.  Maybe a true angel.  Oh.  A true angel?  A true angel.  That's what...  Well, angel, maybe. 
[03:03:00]  A true angel.  It's about to be when they find him.  Ah.  Let's see what's going on with the media.  Trying to figure out whether these people actually have a tie back to an organization.  It's not entirely clear right now.  Just because someone comes to the United States with an intention of killing American nationals,  if that was their intention, you know, it doesn't take a group to do that.  It was a showing.  The actual activity that we have camera access to right now is because the authorities have  asked us not to.  They don't want to compromise tactical positions. 
[03:03:30]  They don't know who else is watching.  Maybe they shut the fucking feed down.  That's why we're not doing it.  When we can, we'll show you what police are comfortable with.  But let's be honest, at the end of the day, our own curiosity is important.  I don't even think at the end of the day.  I think right now.  Yeah, of course.  In early morning hours.  God, if we ran a news organization, we would so blow it.  Oh, we would be the worst.  We would just look right there.  There he is.  We'd have Brian Regan as a reporter.  Hey, I think I see a cop on the roof. 
[03:04:00]  Shots.  It also appeared, at least in my ear, to sound like some sort of explosion.  But again, we weren't there.  We can't verify exactly what happened.  But that was about it.  It lasted a couple seconds and it was done.  And you saw that couple being let out of the house on their front porch.  So we'll get a location for where this is and what's happening there is numerous white cars now come to this neighborhood there, Martha.  Yeah, Bill, we're looking at a picture now on the left-hand side of the screen where you can see police have the doors open. 
[03:04:30]  And this is in Maryland.  And it's believed from the reports we're getting to be an uncle's home.  Sure.  There were reports that we had heard from an uncle earlier today.  I got pictures on there.  He was expressing his disbelief at the events that have unfolded.  Got a guy on the line that was evacuated from his house.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Look at this following up there.  Mike in Watertown.  Hello?  Hey, Mikey.  What's going on, buddy? 
[03:05:00]  What's going on, guys?  Yeah, I called in because that guy that said he's not dead.  I watched him get shot and run over by his brother.  He was shot by the cops and then he got run over by his brother.  His own brother ran him over?  That's what he was saying.  That's classic.  You really saw this?  I really saw it from my window.  You do realize I need a viral video.  Were you shooting some video?  Why didn't you pick up the...  Absolutely not.  There was cops shooting hundreds of rounds off.  You really saw all this go down, huh?  I really saw all this go down. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  All right.  We got to take it seriously.  So walk us through it.  Yeah.  Step by step.  What was the first thing that...  The first thing is you hit a bunch of gunshots and I run to my window.  You hit a bunch of cops saying, get down on the fucking ground.  Get down on the fucking ground.  All this shit.  And you hear them shooting back.  You hear them say, oh, the guy's got a rifle.  And then you hit a big bang.  Then they're like, he's got a fucking grenade.  He's got a bag full of grenades.  And then he's like, there's live ordinance on the street.  All this shit, dude.  Jesus. 
[03:06:00]  Sounds crazy.  Then there was two different gun battles.  There was one right in my neighbor's side, dude.  And then one right in front of my house.  Between, obviously, each brother and different cops.  Holy fuck.  And so...  And then...  So the older brother got shot out front.  And he...  He went down.  The cops ran up to him.  Hit him in the face with a maglite.  Because he wasn't...  He won't stop moving.  You know, they told him, don't move, don't move.  And he...  They're like, I'm going to shoot you. 
[03:06:30]  I'll shoot you in the fucking head.  And there were both over them.  And then the SUV came speeding up the street.  Going like 60 to 80 miles per hour.  And just...  The cops jumped right in the nick of time and fucking ran his brother over.  88 miles an hour.  And then he just disappeared.  All you could see were flaming marks where his tires were.  Wow.  It was a black SUV.  It was like 2 in the morning.  It was right in front of my house.  I completely believe you.  I do, too.  That was pretty good.  Wow.  I like a white people description of gun battles as opposed to black people descriptions on the news or on the phone. 
[03:07:00]  Boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  You saw it all go down right outside your window.  Right outside my window, dude.  And you saw the guy get run over?  Saw him get run over, dragged 30 feet.  It was a mangled mess.  His pool of blood is sitting in front of my pickup truck.  Three feet away from it.  Whoa.  Get a picture.  Yeah.  Can you send that picture to us?  They evacuated us.  What? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, you said that.  They evacuated you.  Right.  Damn.  It's convenient that they evacuated you, by the way.  And then what happened down there was I guess I had such a good shit.  I saw a good shit, and they made me tell the story three times to them on one, to the two detectives.  Then they made me say it on a tape recorder.  Then they wanted me to tell their lieutenant.  Wow.  Because what I saw could help them.  That's what they said.  I don't know.  Wow. 
[03:08:00]  Damn.  Crazy shit, man.  Craziest shit I've ever fucking seen in my life.  Well, I would assume that.  Are you going to have nightmares?  Was it gruesome?  Oh, I'm not going to have nightmares.  Maybe if the good guys got hurt in front of me.  I didn't see it.  Oh, I guess a cop got shot right on the corner.  I didn't see that happen.  But you don't care that you saw a mangled body?  It doesn't really bother me.  It's a terrorist suspect, you know?  Did you see grenades?  Adrenaline's still flowing.  Of course.  You could hear it in your voice.  Did you see grenades go off or any explosives? 
[03:08:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Wow.  I saw, you know, two small ones, one big one right in my neighbor's yard.  I got a bunch of landscaping tools there.  I was working on, you know, there earlier that day.  Half my shit totally has holes in it.  Half my shit totally has holes in it.  Wow.  Oh, man.  My truck probably has fucking bullet holes in it because the cop's SUV pulled right up  in front of my aunt's car in my truck, blocked him in the driveway, got out of the truck,  and started shooting out with the guy in the street.  Jesus. 
[03:09:00]  And then one of the cops ran in my neighbor's yard, and the second guy that got away was  two houses down running through the yard, and, you know, him and the cops shot it out.  I don't know.  I don't think he got hit.  And then he yelled something.  He yelled something to the cop, and then threw some bigger explosive device.  Big fucking orange fireball in the air.  Me and my uncle, I fucking jumped, you know, took my uncle to the ground.  I don't want, you know, shit to come in and kill us, you know, right there in the yard 
[03:09:30]  right next door.  Dude, was it, did you hear, was it automatic fire or semi-automatic?  No, semi-automatic fire.  The cops had handguns, and the guy, the cop said he had a rifle.  Right.  And I think he had a handgun, too.  But you didn't hear, like, automatic, like, you know, it was...  No, no, automatic fire.  It was all semi-automatic.  Wow.  You could definitely tell the difference between the cop's guns and his gun.  And his, yeah, yeah.  And then you could definitely hear the difference in the explosions.  I got, uh, your Anon News, which I follow, um, they got his real Twitter account, it looks 
[03:10:00]  like.  Yeah, I was looking at it.  It hasn't been updated since, like, December.  Yeah, December was the last time he tweeted.  It's at...  It's just Christmas tweets?  It's just soccer shit.  Yeah.  The guy really liked his soccer.  It's just a bunch of soccer stuff, but if you want to see it for yourself, um...  It's his first name with an underscore after it.  Oh.  Or...  Or...  Go to my Twitter, I just retweeted it. 
[03:10:30]  Oh.  Ah!  OP Radio.  It's always easier to just do it that way.  Yeah, it's very easy.  Because, honestly, it's a very tough name to say.  Yeah.  I just retweeted it, uh, OP Radio.  And it's on Anthony Cobian.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  It's there as well.  Hey, uh, Mike, that...  What do we got?  That is a crazy fucking story, man.  Yep.  It's fucking...  I can't believe it.  Yeah, more importantly, we got grilled cheese in the fucking studio right now.  Hey, when you get back, uh, when they let you back to your house, take some pictures 
[03:11:00]  of your truck and any damage and shit and send it to us.  Send it to Anthony Coomey on Twitter.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Anthony Coomey on Twitter.  Or OP Radio, if that's easier to remember.  That's unbelievable.  Anything else you want to add?  Yeah, I mean, I've seen the neighbors down there.  They said that their cars were all shot up.  And some of the explosive shit went into their house.  Right.  And he said he didn't realize it was a gun battle at first.  He's an older gentleman.  He was saying, oh, get the fuck out of here with your fireworks. 
[03:11:30]  And then he's seeing them...  That's all the shit we were saying earlier.  Ah, your goddamn fireworks.  Kids, your goddamn fireworks.  Ah, these fucking kids got no respect for people's yards anymore.  Ah, you're cocksuckers.  And then he realized there was a gun battle and he jumped on the floor too.  They're setting off blockbusters.  He's got a blockbuster.  Took a big divot out of my yard.  That's right.  Yeah, the explosion in the yard was huge. 
[03:12:00]  He threw it out of cough.  And I guess it...  I don't think it went too far.  You know, I think he hurt himself with that, honestly.  More importantly, Mike, do you think this story will get you chicks?  Oh, very good question.  I don't think so.  Why?  Why would it?  What's that matter?  Dude, here's what you do.  You fucking do something to your leg and go, yeah, I was hit.  I was hit.  And then you fucking...  You show a girl, you go, yeah, I was fucking hit.  I actually was...  I jumped in front of one of the officers when one of the explosives went off and actually 
[03:12:30]  saved his life.  But I don't really like talking about it.  Suck my cock.  Yeah, it might work.  He is dead.  Here's...  That guy is definitely dead.  He got fucking mangled.  Well, Alex Jones is going to say he's not dead.  Or he's going to say it's a patsy.  And they had to kill the patsy.  Oh, he's dead.  Self-cutting girl doing a pretty good job on Twitter today. 
[03:13:00]  She just tweeted, he is dead.  Here's the pictures.  Are there pictures?  And I just retweeted that as well.  Here's the aerial shot that's been going around.  Is that?  Zoom in.  Going around?  If it's been going around, why am I seeing it for the first time right now?  I saw it this morning.  Zoom in.  Whoa, that's some blood.  A lot of blood.  I don't...  Where's the body part?  I hear it.  Is that...  Holy fuck.  Is that the body?  Yeah, because he got run over this.  Yeah, man.  What?  It didn't rip him to pieces.  It just, like, fucking broke all of his bones and shit. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's like...  It looks like he smushed him up.  Yeah.  He was still trying to...  I guess he was going to cardiac arrest in front of my...  Well, he was alive at that point, because then, you know, we had the doctor on our show,  technically.  And we had the doctor on the show that worked on him, and he was still alive when they got  him to the hospital, but he was in cardiac arrest.  Yeah, he was twitching, and that's about it.  I mean, he moved a little bit.  A twitcher.  Yeah, he was a twitcher. 
[03:14:00]  Anyways, I don't know, man.  Most fucked up shit I've ever seen.  Now, Mike, were you...  Did you stay up?  Because a lot of this shit started going down around, what, 9, 10, 10, 11 o'clock last  night, or were you woken up by this...  That happened in Cambridge.  Right.  This happened in Watertown at about 2 o'clock.  So you were woken up by just hearing guns and...  Gunshot.  Holy fuck.  I ran to my window, you know, my uncle came in, like, there's a fucking gun battle going  on up front.  Are they serious?  Nah, wake me up later. 
[03:14:30]  I was sleeping, you asshole.  Right.  Tired.  Then the bomb squad ended up coming in with the two little robots and picking up on the  exploded, you know, ordinance on the street.  Bidi, bidi, bidi.  Yeah.  Tweaky.  It was pretty fucked up, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, Mike.  Maybe you'll get some of that post-traumatic stress and be able to get on some good drugs.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Good deal.  Well, Mike, thanks for calling us. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, I'm having a beer right now, and...  Of course you are.  Of course.  I need it.  It's the law.  What's the beer of choice after you see a guy get run over by his brother?  Sam Adams somewhere else.  I love my Sam Adams when you see somebody get run over.  That's good shit, man.  All right.  Of course it's Sam Adams.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Mike.  It's the aromatic hops that make seeing a massacre even better with my Sam Adams. 
[03:15:30]  If you got anything else to add, just call us up, all right?  All right, guys.  All right, Mikey.  Hang in there.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Enjoy your weekend.  You can almost smell the grains of paradise as I see blood come out of his ears and mouth.  New confirmation coming in.  Yeah?  Milk truck sandwiches are delicious.  Ah!  Really?  Delicious.  It's so good.  Really?  Classic ham and cheese or the blue cheese?  We'll cough some of that shit up, nigga.  I went classic with bacon. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm in paradise.  Some are saying that that picture that I just retweeted from Self-Cutting Girl could  be the MIT cop that lost his life.  That's what they're saying.  When that picture first...  I'm just fucking putting it all out there on the table.  So we don't know.  That's what it was reported at as its first shootout.  Right.  What's the classic one?  This is great.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see which ones are with.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Bacon cheddar blue?  Ham and cheese.  Holy...  Mmm.  Who's the milk truck guy?  I am.  What's up, milk truck guy? 
[03:16:30]  How much?  How are you?  This could be the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Holy shit.  This is real.  This is the best.  What do you got, Cuban?  I feel like a douchebag.  So all this stuff happened in Boston, I'm downstairs guiding a milk truck into a grilled cheese truck.  You got to have your priorities.  Craziness.  This is good.  This is a ham and cheese.  Oh, my God.  Jam.  Mmm.  Righteous.  I'm like that.  They're the best grilled cheese sandwiches.  You think?  Mmm.  Wow.  Wow.  What should I have?  The classic or the... 
[03:17:00]  Damn, this is good.  What do you have there?  The bacon cheddar blue?  Yeah.  Yeah, give that.  It's ignited the money.  Try the classic now, okay?  Try the classic.  Sure, why not?  Troy Kwan.  Bacon cheddar.  Ooh.  Yo, Troy Kwan.  What?  Mmm.  You think Fez was jerking off to you?  He's pissed at Fez.  I know.  I saw Fez in the hall yesterday.  Wow.  He's a...  And of course, Troy thought it was him.  He's a fucking asshole.  Whoa!  Why?  Whoa! 
[03:17:30]  Oh, hi.  Mass State Police channel.  He was talking shit.  In what way?  Well, he was just saying shit.  Like, I walk around here all pompous and...  Yeah.  He said you walk around here all pompadour.  Yeah, no one has said that before.  Dude, I say hi to him every time I see him.  And he's gonna come out with some shit like that?  Fuck him.  Damn.  Damn, he's pissed at him.  It's good grilled cheese, though.  Oh, my God.  Thanks, guys.  So good.  Matt. 
[03:18:00]  What are the state he's talking about?  Let's say...  You have mass police radio on your...  Yeah.  That's cool, isn't it?  Yeah.  Matt.  Who's up?  How good are these fucking grilled cheese sandwiches?  The best.  Hey, chef.  I saw this.  If you haven't, you need me.  Can you meet me on the booth?  What's with TV?  Well, the state radios are even worse than fucking...  I don't know if they're better than that. 
[03:18:30]  No, that one sucks.  Nothing happening there?  Well...  Best food to watch the news with.  It really is good, man.  Good news food.  Yeah.  How do people get you and get your sandwiches?  We actually...  We have a truck.  We're at different locations every day of the week. 
[03:19:00]  And we're also at four markets on the weekend at the Brooklyn Plea at Smorgasburg.  And we also have our sandwich menu at Houston Hall, down on Houston, between 6th and Verrick.  Man.  Now, these food trucks are becoming, obviously, very popular.  Yes.  How much fucking money?  Do you have to pay the city and all that shit?  Hey, what are you doing there?  Don't deconstruct that.  I hope you just ripped the sandwich and haven't tossed something in the garbage. 
[03:19:30]  I like your sandwich and threw it against the wall.  I'm trying to prevent a heart attack.  Yeah, that's okay.  It's too late.  It's amazingly good.  Everything in moderation.  Don't have to pay the city, but...  Yeah, I heard they're starting to crack down on your motherfuckers.  You know, we have a...  Talking to the mic.  ...relationship with the city.  We're actually...  You know, we try to, like...  We have a truck association.  We're working with the city, but it is...  It's complicated.  You know, let's just put it that way.  No doubt.  Yeah.  Is it like a free-for-all out there right now? 
[03:20:00]  You know what?  Among the trucks, there's kind of a...  I wouldn't call it a gentleman's agreement, because it's no gentleman.  But, you know, there's a tacit agreement.  You know, if you've secured a spot and you've been in that spot for a while,  that's your spot on that day.  You know, like Frankie's down there, Cupcakes guy, he's down there on Fridays.  And that's his spot.  Oh, okay.  We pulled up this morning.  He kind of looked at us.  He said, do you guys want to park here today?  And we kind of have to get his permission.  Wow.  Sounds like the mob.  I'm kidding, man.  But it's a... 
[03:20:30]  There's no guns.  It's a very difficult situation.  There's your guns.  It's a very difficult situation.  Situation.  It's a very difficult situation.  Only the Mr. Softies.  That's the...  They're the real mob.  Yeah.  Honestly, I don't eat much from food trucks.  No?  Why not?  But I would eat from the...  I don't know.  I love this, though.  It's amazing.  That is goddamn good.  There's a compliment.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  I like.  Mm.  Delicious.  Delicious.  Good one.  Very good.  Mm. 
[03:21:00]  Everybody's standing on line.  They think it's open downstairs.  All right?  They just get on line.  The fatties are just great.  What do you mean?  You got a menu?  I'm like, get out of here, you fat bastard.  The smart thing to do would be go down the line and go, okay, what do you want?  We, you know, okay, pay now.  Exactly.  And just have someone go down the line.  Grab the money and fucking take off.  That's about three hours.  Yeah.  All the foodies are downstairs.  Oh, a milk truck is here.  Oh, I love this.  It's great. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, that's fucking good.  Really good.  Really good.  Because he just brought the truck over to Midtown just for us.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You guys got pulled.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  That was great.  I was going to, you know, I heard grilled cheese and I'm like, I'm not a big fan, but  because I'm just thinking your basic wonder bread and fucking American cheese.  Sure.  But this with the ham on it and a fucking mustard and goddamn whatever kind of grape bread you're  using here. 
[03:22:00]  Pickles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good bread.  That's a rosemary Pullman bread.  Oh.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, it's fancy stuff.  I want big bread.  I've been working with this.  I keep folding it.  Now it just gets smaller.  It's a catastrophe.  My blood pressure just went up.  Yeah.  That's really good.  That's a good sign, right?  Yeah.  Getting all warm and shit.  Yeah.  What's the big plug?  Because we've got to get back to this manhunt. 
[03:22:30]  Sorry that the day became weird.  I mean, we were going to do a whole thing with you.  Yeah, no, that's cool.  Absolutely.  It's a weird time.  There's something going on in Boston today.  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  You can follow him at Milk Truck NYC.  On Twitter?  Yeah, on Twitter.  And then Facebook, Milk Truck NYC.  Absolutely.  I highly recommend that.  You go to Smorgasburg this weekend.  It's so good.  If you're in the New York area, get a fucking grilled cheese sandwich.  Yeah, come visit us.  We're on the truck.  You can also call us on the truck at 646-504-MILK.  So on the Twitter account, do you go, hey, man, we're here today type of thing? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, every day.  So people know?  If you follow us, we'll let you know where we are every day.  We'll tell you what we're doing.  I've been teaching a class on the mobile food business this weekend.  Right.  So if you want to know more about the food business.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  When you leave the building, make sure you avoid the sales department.  They're going to want you to advertise.  Those cocksuckers.  Good luck, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Oh, great.  That was really good.  Damn.  Delicious.  Well, that's an hour on the treadmill. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got my fucking trainer today.  And now cupcakes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Was it good?  The door is locked.  That's a scam.  I can't gain access.  The TV is glaring in the background.  What is this?  This is the Cambridge Police and Fire.  I'm with them.  I'm with them.  I'm with them.  I have it.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:24:00]  Now they're saying he could be in Connecticut.  What?  Are you kidding?  On CNN, they're giving out his license plate number.  CNN.  316.  Looking for mass tags.  He says ES9.  And he could be in Connecticut.  They locked down the whole neighborhood.  How could he be in Connecticut?  So.  Connecticut.  I guess they couldn't find the car after he ran over his brother.  Please not find the car.  I'm guessing.  Maybe he went into one of those garages that repaint it.  And then you back out.  Oh, right.  And you have no stars on your fucking screen. 
[03:24:30]  It only takes 30 seconds.  And all the cops go, 30 seconds.  What the hell happened?  What happened?  What the fuck?  When they walk around, it's nothing.  All confused.  They scratch their head.  And then they go back to their regular patrol.  You know, if he's smart, he'll run into a subway tunnel.  And just stand there for about 10 minutes.  It'll go away.  And then it goes away.  Then the heat's off.  Right.  The heat is off.  I like good video game police and video game, like, guards and stuff.  They're like, hey, yo, what are you?  That must be the wind. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Because your snore is way down.  There's something there.  Who's back there?  Hmm.  I guess my ears are playing tricks on me.  They sure give up fast in video games.  If he might be in Connecticut, we might be going home.  I gotta go.  I actually gotta go.  Really?  Yeah, I can't stay late today.  I'm hearing New York law enforcement is now posting license plate pictures and stuff at all state and county lines.  He got out.  How did he get out?  Well, he ran over his brother.  I would assume that would...  That was his ticket to freedom? 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  He pretty much won't stop for a roadblock if he ran over his own brother.  That is pretty much a rule of thumb.  What a...  Chachnians are crazy dudes, man.  Man, you run over your own brother.  Holy fuck.  Your own brother.  I got it.  Wouldn't you have to take it at that point?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I guess I gotta slow it out.  There goes the theory of that Twitter account and him being mad at the cops for killing his brother.  Right.  He just ran over.  If he's in Connecticut, that means he's heading south.  How can we spin this into a New York story? 
[03:26:00]  Is he coming to our area?  Guaranteed they will start saying that on the local news.  Could be in Connecticut.  Is he heading to New York?  How is our area preparing for the arrival of teen terrorists?  We'll let you know.  I say bring it.  Oh, do I hope I get a knock on the door.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  The news is so far behind.  It's not going to happen.  After show, right? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, well, you might have to.  Ronnie just arrived.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  Sleep in the party, man.  All right.  I eat another half of my sandwich.  That grilled cheese sandwich was ridiculous.  I ate half.  That's all I could have.  I ate whole...  Oh, I tried to knock down the calories and the fucking guy caught me.  Pat killed me.  Yeah, I got mad at you.  Yeah, man.  The bread is all buttered, all nice and stuff.  I figured, all right, I'll take one slice away.  You threw it so angrily, though, guys.  Hey, what are you doing?  That ham and cheese is so fucking good, right?  Oh, my God.  Right?  You got to try the bacon. 
[03:27:00]  Well, yeah, but not today.  Anthony?  I'm done eating.  They say suspected bombers are brothers.  Wow, that's breaking news from MSNBC.  You know why?  They did not want to fucking deal with the reality.  They were still going with the right-wing Tea Party activist angle.  And they finally had to give up on that?  They still won't fucking sway.  Man, they overused that whole breaking news thing, don't they?  The news is awful with this thing.  They're so behind.  Breaking news.  Really?  It seemed...  We're getting reports that something has interrupted the Boston Marathon. 
[03:27:30]  Oh!  We got to at least say hi to Roddy, and then we'll get out of here.  Yeah, you can have fun with that.  Say hi to Roddy.  Bring Roddy in.  All right.  We're going to do a little switcheroo.  Unless some shit goes down in the next minute, we're out of here.  Yeah, I'm shutting the...  Roddy!  Wait.  What's up, Roddy?  What's happening, man?  Sorry, I'm late.  Oh, that's all right.  I'm addressing my GPS.  What happened?  What happened?  I got the wrong address to my GPS.

You're late.  What the hell's going on?  All hell's breaking loose, and you're late.  It's chaos out there.  Is it?  Yeah, it's crazy.  I've been sitting in the city.  You're the, uh, I think you're the last guy from the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, I haven't done your guy's show yet.  What the fuck?  Everyone else did.  You were one of my fans.  You guys don't want me.  I was like, all right, fuck him. 
[03:29:30]  That ain't it.  What happened?  I think you spoke.  I was like, I'll just go right across and do who, kid?  Forget him.  Who, kid?  Who did it else?  He's hilarious.  Sam, though, you got to talk to Sam, and he was telling me a story that Snooki used to watch you fuck  or something.  Oh, all the time.  I found that very fascinating.  It was creepy.  Yeah, you find it fascinating, and I find it creepy.  It was creepy, right?  Creepy.  What would she do?  Would she moan or anything?  In Italy, we had a, there was no, there was no wall.  It was like, uh, you know, like any of you guys who go to the gym, like the showers,  the foggy windows. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So there was, that's what it was.  So she would, like, peek her eyes and saw it, like, so you could see if you put one like  this, and she would watch me and Sam have sex.  Nice.  What a perv.  Right?  Creepy.  She's a mom now.  Was she manipulating herself, uh, doing that, or fucking moaning?  I hope not.  You didn't find her very attractive?  Oh, God, no.  No, I didn't either.  She's like a fire plug.  I was never into that chick, man.  Horrible.  I was amazed she was able to get so much, uh, dick.  Well, I mean, come on.  She has a vagina, so she has all the power. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, exactly.  She has all the power.  She has a vagina.  Exactly.  At the end of the day.  She's, uh, no, fuck that.  And then she lied to us, so fuck her.  We had to scoop on her pregnancy.  Fuck her, Sam, I say.  She wasn't three months pregnant yet.  Oh, that's how she spun it.  She was sitting right where the Cuban was, and I go, yo, Snooki, you're pregnant, I'm hearing  things.  And she lied right to her face.  You don't even tell all your friends.  And then Radar announced it that day.  Yeah, you're right, E-Roc.  Because she sold it.  Why the fuck is Sam sticking up for Snooki?  She sold it.  Yeah.  She wanted to sell the story instead of being honest in front of us. 
[03:31:00]  What kind of work has she done recently?  Because, man.  Teeth, obviously.  I think she's got her teeth done.  She just lost a lot of weight.  Yeah.  She's really into, like, the circuit training.  She's always posting pictures of her working out and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what she's into now?  Yeah.  Being a mom.  That's cool.  That's fucked up.  That's cool.  Yeah, that's cool.  I love when chicks are moms.  Take a hike.  Spence right there.  She's with her man, though. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  That guy put up with a lot of stuff.  Yeah, he did.  Who the hell would put up with that crap?  She put him through a lot.  Yeah.  And she's fucking virtually a midget, right?  She's really a fucking midget.  How tall is she for real, Ronnie?  4'9", she says.  4'9", that's midget.  I think anything under 5 is midget territory.  I'm pretty close then.  Fuck that.  I ain't fucking with you, man.  I've seen what you could do.  Fuck that.  Fuck that shit.  So what you got going on, man?  What's the...  Oh, me.  You know, after the show and then, I just started taking acting classes down here in the city 
[03:32:00]  and doing that for about four or five months.  Nice shit.  Yeah, I released my...  I've been doing a lot of movie promos to help promote commercials on MTV.  A bunch of movies.  I did something for, you know, the Die Hard movie for The Last Stand with Farron Swartzenegger.  I just did something with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx for their new movie that's coming out.  Fuck it, Jamie Foxx.  Yeah.  Fucking guy.  He's a little rough.  I'm sorry.  I don't think he's as good as everyone's putting him on that pedestal to say he is.  He did well with the Ray Charles thing? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, he did a fucking Ray Charles impression.  That's not acting.  That's fucking...  That's like fucking...  Honestly, think about it.  The guy did an impression of Ray Charles.  But he did well.  That's not acting, though.  We got a situation.  Yeah, that guy.  The fucking guy.  The fucking...  Soprano guy.  Yeah, Cook.  Cook.  Fucking Max Cook.  He does an amazing Tony Soprano impression.  All right, so he should have a movie.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  Are you saying, wow, he's a great actor?  No.  It's a very difficult situation.  Situate.  The way he says that.  Situate.  It kills me.  But no.  And then he puts out like a few other movies where he's playing a tough guy and stuff.  And then the Django thing.  Of course.  You got a black guy kicking the ass out of fucking 1800s fucking slave owners.  Everyone's going to be like, that rules.  But it doesn't mean he's a good actor.  He was like a black Zorro.  He was like killing people.  Yeah, yeah.  He was crazy with the guns and stuff.  Exactly.  I didn't like him in Django. 
[03:33:30]  I would have taken any other black guy in there.  I think you might have a little bit of bias to tell you the truth.  Did you?  Well, I know.  I understand.  It's got to be a black guy.  What if he lied to you about his pregnancy?  You're like, I wonder.  Yeah, really.  I think there might be some politics.  Yeah, he didn't like that.  He wore a Trayvon Martin t-shirt.  Well.  Yeah.  He had a problem with the Trayvon Martin t-shirt.  You know why?  Because the stupid MTV Movie Awards are not fucking there for your political billboards.  Yo, we got an MTV guy with us.  Relax.  What?  No, I'd say the MTV.  It probably still gets paid from MTV.  But the Movie Award, like. 
[03:34:00]  Me?  No.  Nothing.  Done.  Yeah.  Because then you should be able to just wear anything on a shirt.  And I'm sure that they would have a problem if there were other people that had other  political ideologies or things that were walking out on a stage.  Well, I feel like he's just like at that stature where he's like, he's like Adam Sandler.  See, but he shouldn't be there.  Adam Sandler shows up in like white t-shirts with holes in it and in sweatpants.  And acts all uncomfortable like he's never done this before.  It's so good to be here on the watch show.  Give me another $30 million. 
[03:34:30]  Never done this before.  I'll take another $30 million for acting like an adult retard.  All right.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  And did you start the morning drinking some Haterade?  I know, man.  You're pissed.  I don't say one hasn't had a good movie in a long time.  And they're doing Grown Ups 2.  I don't understand.  Grown Ups 2.  Because one had so many unanswered questions.  Oh, in that blue.  At the end, I was really.  I left the theater.  I had to go to message boards and talk about it.  He started a blog. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, God.  It was fucking.  It was just like watching that Melancholia movie.  I didn't know what the fuck was happening.  I'd rather look at Snooki's asshole.  What a visual.  Isn't that her husband?  Ronnie, you had a hell of a run.  You had a hell of a run, man.  You didn't think it was going to last that long, did you?  No, it was a crazy experience.  I still go through.  You know, every day is something new.  Yeah.  And it's really rare.  I remember I was down in Philly when Jersey Shore popped for the first time. 
[03:35:30]  I'm like, this is fucked up.  I never get that feeling.  It was like a tidal wave.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  It was crazy because the day that the show aired, it was my birthday.  The next day, me and Sam went out.  And it's like, we went into the bar.  And it's like, you get that fucking weird feeling.  It's like, why is everybody fucking staring at me for?  I'm like, look, I'm going in the bathroom looking at my face.  I'm like, fucking everyone's looking at me.  And then all of a sudden, it's just like, hey, can I get a picture? 
[03:36:00]  And then next thing you know, we tend to take pictures with everybody in the bar.  And I'm like, is this what it's going to be like?  And then for sure, it was just fucking...  You were tormented, though.  Let's be honest.  You wanted to go through that whole thing single.  What the fuck?  You know your timing was horrible.  You're like, are you kidding me?  Well, you know what it was?  Dater now.  But that was the torment you were feeling.  It was so obvious.  It was like, holy fuck.  But I mean, if you think about it, if you actually look at the girls...  And Sam is awesome.  If you look at the girls that the guys did bring home, I mean... 
[03:36:30]  Bullshit.  A little fucking beat up.  I mean, my dick would go inside me.  It would be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It was like four years of blue balls.  Like, come on.  Vinny brought home two dudes that one time.  Just try to call it a threesome.  I was like, no.  Just because there's three people involved.  It has to be two girls, right?  It was like...  Vinny's the sensitive one.  Yeah.  Well, Vinny is a sensitive person.  Vinny's the sensitive one.  Yeah, there was some fucking...  Yeah, I might get a text after that.  I know you are. 
[03:37:00]  Why are you talking about me like that, bro?  You're messing up my aura, man.  He does.  He's doing his, like, kind of a talk show from his house.  That's a great idea.  His family and everything.  Yeah, I saw the preview they did after the MTV Movie Awards with Kesha came in.  Really?  Kesha?  I'm definitely tuning in now.  And then fucking...  Wasn't it Drake or somebody?  Little Wayne, I think.  Little Wayne was it.  It was Little Wayne.  Uncle Wayne went to his house?  Did they have some of that syrup? 
[03:37:30]  Did Vinny's mom mix up some scissor for everybody?  I have some scissor for you.  I wonder if she got on his skateboard.  Yeah.  I'm serving fresh scissor for everybody.  How much protein do you take?  We got some scissor and monocotty.  And monocotty.  Little Wayne's house.  Little Wayne and Vinny's house. 
[03:38:00]  And his mom.  Oh, I have to watch that.  Hey, don't drink the scissor.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  What the fuck?  I got the scissor, but I'm drinking it.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Uncle Nino.  Uncle Nino.  We had Nino do one of our gigs, man.  He's a real Nino.  I love mine.  They were at the Movie Awards this week, and I saw Vinny flew out his mom and Uncle Nino.  He was actually being normal.  Was he?  That's hard.  Wow.  They must have gave him a lot of protein. 
[03:38:30]  I see where Vinny's just got to be like, no, calm down.  He treats him like a child.  Like, no.  You calm down.  Sit in the corner.  Time out, Uncle Nino.  Too funny.  You and Sam still together or what?  Yeah, me and Sam are still together.  We actually live together now.  Wow.  How's that working?  It's working.  Yeah.  It's going.  You guys been together a long time?  Four years this year.  Are you getting the pressure for the old ring-a-roo?  Don't do it.  No, I figured I'm going to let Snooki and Jenny make all the mistakes, and then I'm going to 
[03:39:00]  do the opposite of what they did.  And then they'll slide in nice.  That's how they watched my relationship, and they were like, wow, that's fucked up.  Right.  I'm not going to do what they do.  You know shit.  And then they learned that I'm going to do that with their marriage.  Don't do it wrong.  It's awful.  It's awful.  JWoww had a little plastic surgery, I said.  A little?  What the fuck would she do that?  She told me.  Why the fuck would she do that?  She has not had any plastic surgery.  How about that?  That's what she told me.  Yeah.  See, you hang out with liars.  Another liar.  Yeah, and Sam doesn't wear hair extensions. 
[03:39:30]  She's got those nice soccer legs.  Yeah.  Now.  She was very cool in here.  Yeah, nothing bad to say about her.  She's just sitting right there.  Hey, I would love to hang out for this fucking lovely thing.  I got to go.  Yeah, I'm going to go.  I got to go.  My truck's downstairs, and the guys ticket the fucking truck.  I got to have fucking, which I do, like have ex-cops in there, in my truck, on the  side of the road, and they still get written up by the fucking meter maids.  Yeah.  The wannabe fucking cops that couldn't pass the test, so they fucking became meter maids, 
[03:40:00]  and tunnel fucking cops.  Bridge and tunnel fucking.  Women.  Douchebags.  Fuck you.  Enjoy your speeding ticket tonight.  No, I take the Queensborough Bridge now when I go home.  Now they're definitely going to pull you over.  They have to be on the lookout for me at the Hittown Tunnel.  You know, you really?  Pull you over.  They do.  They fucking.  You should have to pull them over.  Fuck with you.  I ran from a guy, and his jurisdiction ends at fucking 30 steps from the toll booth, so  he couldn't chase me.  It's like a troll. 
[03:40:30]  Did he have to stop in mid-run?  He saw the line and went, oh, man.  Fucking Mike the Cop is on my house.  And then as he's trying to go like this, come on.  Yeah, yeah.  They put, like, the little child leash on him.  Yeah.  Jerks him back to a certain point.  When fucking, yeah, when Foghorn Leghorn would fucking measure the dog's collar and leash  and then run out and bang the pan over his head, that's me.  I'd just wait.  Wait for the leash to run out.  Mike the fucking cop had such a fucking funny line at the poker game the other night. 
[03:41:00]  He goes, yeah, we were going through the toll booth, and one of the toll cops were there,  and he had a chest full of ribbons and medals.  He goes to my buddy in the other seat.  He leans over and goes, what'd you get that for?  Breaking a 50?  He went above and beyond the call of duty.  Oh, that hurts.  He broke a 50.  He kept traffic moving fluidly through the plaza.  Yeah, he's not getting over the place.  You're not getting over the place.  No bridge, no tunnel.  Ed Koch Bridge.  No, suspect number two might be heading our way, so it's all right. 
[03:41:30]  They're on the lookout for him.  I can't believe they didn't get him before the end of our show.  We could have wrapped this up all nice today.  I know, it's supposed to be a nice package.  It would have been a nice fucking end to an amazing movie.  You could start again tomorrow, you'll still be ahead of CNN.  Yeah, probably true.  They'll be reporting what we did today.  Exactly.  Tomorrow.  On there.  Something else will happen next.  Listen to the scanner.  It's crazy shit.  Something else.  Any more dirt, Ronnie?  I'd love to talk.  I gotta go.  Just in case he has something big. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, I gotta go.  If it's a basic interview, then I'm out, too.  I'm out, too.  Well, you can hang out because Sam Roberts does the after show.  I'll interview you, Ronnie.  Hey, you know, I don't mean to jump on you or anything, but you are late.  I know, I know.  Thanks, man.  All right, I'm going.  Gents.  Fuck it, I'm going, too.  Take it easy.  Sam Roberts, after show.  Are you going to continue from this point, or are you going to take a break?  All right, take a break.  Sam's going to continue with Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  Take it around, Ronnie? 
[03:42:30]  Hey, where's Jimmy again?  Magoobies?  Magoobies in Baltimore for Jim Norton.  I think there's some tickets still available.  And we'll see you guys Monday.  Have a good weekend.  Sam, we'll continue.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck? 
[03:43:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over. 
[03:43:30]  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  On Demand.  On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, we're back on.  Live.  After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Ronnie's still hanging out.  What's up, man?  Cuban's here.  Roland's here. 
[03:44:00]  Trying to figure out what's going on with this Boston thing.  Yeah, I'm trying to look at the screen behind you.  Do you know anything that's gone on?  I was listening to it on the way here.  When you were driving in.  So they've just been recapping and recapping.  Yeah, I think they killed the first suspect.  Yeah.  They're looking for the second one right now, I think.  Yeah.  I woke up at like 4, and I'd gone to bed around 9.30.  So I missed the whole thing.  They called them at 1 a.m. or something like that.  They started at like 10 o'clock.  Yeah, yeah.  Before you went to bed, they started.  Right.  And so I'm scrolling through Twitter like, what the fuck? 
[03:44:30]  What about the stupid bastards you just blew up Boston, and you're going to go out and  rob a store?  At 7-Eleven.  Can you cause any more attention to yourself?  Right.  Especially right after they figure out, like, it's been enough days have gone by that they  figured out, based on the security footage, they got pictures of you now, dude.  Like, you can't.  Let me go alone and rob a fucking store.  That's another one.  Rob a 7-Eleven.  Get a truck while I'm at it.  Not even a bank.  A 7-Eleven.  Like, what are you going to get?  $75?  If you're 19 and your goal is to blow up a fucking marathon, chances are you're going 
[03:45:00]  to keep doing stupid shit.  Yeah, you're a stupid asshole.  Chances are.  It's like, all day, I wake up and I'm like, I don't want to blow anything up.  But what's a me?  Yeah, I've never had that feeling.  I've had horrible days.  And I'm like, fuck, you know what I'm going to do today?  I'm going to go to the library.  I'm going to blow that fucking thing up.  It never happens.  It's never happened.  Like, there's a big event happening.  Lots of people there.  You've never wanted to.  So the minute you cross that thing, whatever you tell me after, I'm like, well,  you know, like, I blew up the marathon.  What did he do?  He ate a baby? 
[03:45:30]  Fuck, that guy's fucking up.  Yeah.  But I know that that's where he's going.  We've been tracking this thing, like, the whole show.  Assuming that they're going to get to it, and we were listening to the police scanner,  because on the iPhone, they have an app that's all the police scanners.  And so we've been listening to the police scanner in Water...  Where are they?  Watertown?  Watertown.  Watertown.  Yeah, Watertown, something like that.  Yeah, Watertown, Massachusetts, until they cut their feet off, because I guess everybody was  doing that, and they were like, this doesn't help, because...  Yeah, because then the kid could listen to it.  The kid, yeah.  The kid is listening to ONA, like, we're fucking about this. 
[03:46:00]  We're fucking right around the corner from these guys.  I'm just going to go the other way.  Exactly.  But now, so they shut down.  And from 4 a.m., the whole, within 20 blocks of where they were, was totally shut down  by the cops.  So they're like, it's all shut down.  You cannot go anywhere.  We're just going to hit every single house until we find you.  Now, however many hours later, six hours later, I guess, they're starting to put things up  on the news that cops are now putting out his license plate, because they're afraid  he's, like, driving to Connecticut. 
[03:46:30]  It's like, how the fuck did he get to Connecticut?  Because he blew up the fucking marathon.  Where there's a will, there's a way, you're saying.  If he had a car, why'd he steal the other one?  I think they carjacked him.  You ever talk to a check, Sam?  I think they carjacked him.  Apparently, these kids, like, they went to, like, good, like, the kid would go into a  good high school.  Like, he went to the same school Ben Affleck, Matt Damon went to.  Ben Affleck's going to catch him.  And nobody, and this makes the town, like, you watch...  He's going to grow back the beard from Argo and catch him. 
[03:47:00]  If Ben Affleck catches him, I'm going to become a Scientologist.  You watch the town, and it's like, when you watch that movie, you're like, this could  never happen when they're running around, like, chasing ambulances with cops and everything,  and you're like, holy shit, this is happening.  Like, and it's in Boston.  Yeah, the safest city, like.  Like, look at them.  You can see them on TV now.  They're pulling up in the big black Humvees and everything.  Just, it's amazing.  Well, they surrounded a house on the way here.  I don't know if they were showing this, but they pulled two people out, but I don't know  if it was, like...  Yeah, we were listening.  We thought they had them, because while we were listening, they were like, the police scanner was like, 
[03:47:30]  get the battering ram ready.  So they were going to pull...  They never got it, but they were going to pull out a battering ram.  They had him within, like, three houses.  They were like, get down and be out of the field of vision.  Don't let...  And he wasn't in there.  They were like, yeah, there's some guy in a hoodie that's running from backyard to backyard,  but they can't find this guy yet.  Why do they keep showing his first communion picture?  How is that going to happen?  They don't have any pictures of him.  This is him as an embryo.  Yeah.  Look out for him.  And that's the other thing.  Like, people, you know, who aren't aware yet, like, they're like, oh, he must have just 
[03:48:00]  come from Chechnya, like, a year ago or something.  This kid's been in America for ten years.  Ten years.  He's been here since he was nine years old.  Yeah.  You know?  And he had a scholarship at school.  The older brother was, like, the ringleader.  You think, like, the older brother was...  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  And he was saying, the young one, they have the young one placing the bombs, though.  Right.  They have them on footage.  So it's almost like maybe he was the puppet in a way.  Right.  Where it's like, you know, what can you do to your younger brother?  Like, go touch the stove, even though Mom said not to.  Like, I was like...  To grab my little brother. 
[03:48:30]  I'm like, you know, we're going to blow up the fucking marathon tonight.  This is cool, like...  Did you hear what happened with the initial, with the shootout that killed the older brother?  No, I was sleeping.  When this kid got...  He got away from the shootout.  That's where he survived it.  That's where the older brother...  They were in a big shootout with police after the carjacking.  And the older brother ended up getting shot, and he was out of the car.  Yeah.  The younger brother gets in the driver's seat and ran over his older brother to get out of there.  Ran over him.  Fucking Chechnyans. 
[03:49:00]  Crazy.  Brutaless.  Supposedly the younger ones putting stuff on, like, Facebook, saying that you killed my brother, I'm going to kill you.  We looked into it, like they were saying that.  But the Twitter account that they were getting that from...  It's a fake one.  It was created an hour ago.  So unless he's hiding out, creating Twitter accounts, and just tweeting at the Boston Police Department...  Which would make him...  Probably not him.  In a hut somewhere, it's like tweeting.  Right.  That's how bad he is.  He's Lex Luthor.  You could probably track the IPs on that somehow.  I think there might be a way.  The only on-the-ground hut with a Wi-Fi, so he can make a Twitter. 
[03:49:30]  God damn it!  Wi-Fi's down again.  He's unplugging his router in.  Bullshit hotspots.  Trying to listen to O&A so I can figure out where the cops are and start my Twitter account.  Yeah, this is crazy.  And they still...  I mean, this whole time, this whole...  Every time they're like a little closer, he's just not there.  It's crazy, man.  I've come to the conclusion that the news has no fucking idea what's going on.  They don't have a clue.  The first thing it happened, it's like, you go from channel to channel, it's like, one 
[03:50:00]  person dead, this many injured, then the next one's like, 19 people.  It's like, everyone has a different story.  I'm like, which one is it?  I'm like, what is it?  And like, yesterday afternoon, there were pictures of four totally different guys.  And they were like, these are the suspects.  And there were guys sitting at home like, what the fuck?  I was just running.  I just wanted to watch people run.  How did this happen?  I'm like, that's me, dude.  I'm in New Jersey.  Why am I on the TV?  I've never even been to Boston.  I hate Boston. 
[03:50:30]  Maybe that's why.  I knew I should have closed my MySpace account.  Where did I get that photo from?  My MySpace account.  We were saying that, like, the news, I would think after this whole thing, anybody who knows  how to figure stuff out, it has totally destroyed any credibility.  Because, like, we, on the show today, we're getting everything way quicker than the news  just by talking to people on the phone and going online.  Like, you know, just at any time, like, there's a little tip, like you said, like, yeah,  apparently he's talking and he's threatening the cops on his Facebook or whatever. 
[03:51:00]  All right, let's go look it up.  You can tell, right?  Just look at it.  Anybody who uses Twitter could be like, let's obviously say.  We play a member since one hour ago.  Right.  This is the first time in my life where I've seen the FBI come on to me and be like, yo,  guys, help us out.  We're fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, I don't know.  Here's a picture.  Um, here's a license plate, a picture.  Here's a picture.  Motherfuckers are crazy.  We're jeopardizing everybody in Boston right now.  Or stop them.  Or we'll give you a badge.  You know what I mean?  Everyone in Boston has a badge right now. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  Everyone's a cop.  Apparently this little fucker is fast.  You gotta find him.  Like, September 11th, like, they figured it all out by themselves and then they just told  us.  Right.  This thing, they're like, all right, listen.  Something real bad happened yesterday.  It's giving me the creeps, too, especially the Chechnyan thing, because I was watching  the Pine Barrens episode of Sopranos last night.  Yeah.  Where that guy who killed the Chechnyan.  He disappeared.  They never found him.  Exactly.  The trail just went cold.  It's the same guy.  That little kid is a guy.  He just resurfaced.  Right.  Good Lord.  But yeah, so we're finding everything quicker than the news. 
[03:52:00]  And then...  Look at that cop.  Killed the cop, right?  You know that guy doesn't look tough.  You know he was getting shot.  He's just out of the academy.  Well, yeah, he was like an MIT cop.  Oh, great.  You know what I mean?  He was at MIT.  Oh, it was like a security cop.  The cop who died, yeah.  Oh, so that's...  He probably didn't even have a gun.  I don't know.  Probably had a whistle and a flashlight.  MIT, bro.  He had a protractor.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But you'd think the news would at least be where you go to be like, all right, all  this bullshit on the internet, I'll wait until it's on the news to confirm it. 
[03:52:30]  But then, like, two days ago, CNN is already reporting, suspects in custody, job is done.  Right.  And you're like, no, it's first...  Yeah.  I had, like, some...  No, it's not done.  There's nobody in custody.  The cops had to come on and be like, yeah, I know we're on CNN now, but until I've spoken,  don't believe anything that's been on television.  I know.  It's all been incorrect.  Yeah, it's all wrong, yeah.  God damn.  So, yeah, I mean, you just got to go to the internet and just talk to...  If a person's not talking like a person...  Just go to the internet.  Yeah, you can't believe it. 
[03:53:00]  Or Megan Kelly, Fox News.  Yeah.  I'll listen to it, even though it's wrong.  Yeah, whatever she's saying.  She could be saying absolutely nonsense.  I put duct tape over her eyes and I just watch her mouth.  As long as a blonde is saying it, right?  Yeah.  It's all good.  Just watch her mouth.  Megan Kelly.  Yeah, it's on mute.  And you're like, I'm getting all the facts I need.  Yeah, I'm looking at her.  Yeah.  She's staring at her lips.  Yeah.  She's, like, talking about her rabies.  She's like, I love when he talked to her.  I'd like to save her from a burning building.  So you don't think Ronnie should get married to Sam?  No, don't do it. 
[03:53:30]  You don't think so?  Would you, Ronnie?  I mean, I believe in marriage.  I think that, like...  I don't think it's real.  It exists.  Don't do it, man.  That shit's poltergeist.  To be fair, I've seen the Cuban here with his wife.  He's a terrible husband.  I mean, he's not a good husband.  So it's one of those things.  I mean, Troy, he's not a good husband.  He's terrible.  Thank you.  So, I mean, and you understand, you know, no offense is intended, but...  No, no, I'm offended, but for the record, I'm not offended. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  Right.  Right.  So, I mean, he could be coloring that a little bit.  Like, maybe the reason his wife hates him is because he's a terrible husband.  I don't know for sure.  Well, it's got something to do with it.  I mean, she doesn't hate me because I'm awesome.  I feel like a lot of people just rush into getting married.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, oh my God, let's get married.  It's like, don't forget it.  She gets half your shit.  Yes.  And you probably want to be like...  Gets half your shit.  You probably want to be like, yeah, we've been together for four years.  Yeah.  But let's try to stack up some off-TV years.  Exactly. 
[03:54:30]  Let's do it the normal way.  Yeah, because I would assume being on TV and actually...  Because most of the reality shows are fake.  Relationship, working in a short store, hanging out on the boardwalk and going to karma every  night.  That's not a real relationship.  Right.  Yeah.  We're getting paid to just hang out and get fucked up and work in a t-shirt store.  But we're going to throw a relationship in there to spice things up.  Yeah.  Once you leave and you're actually responsible for your own income, you know what I mean?  Like, actually, okay, now we have to start some businesses and really move and stuff. 
[03:55:00]  That's when difficulties can come up.  So you want...  Yeah, yeah.  You want to...  That's why you have to do a lot of marriages, too, is because they can't afford to be married  to people.  Don't do it.  Right.  You're just saying no.  No.  Would you give that advice to everyone, though, Cuban?  Absolutely.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  Stay engaged forever.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  I just stay engaged forever.  That's it.  Yeah.  What about if you're with a woman?  How much money you spend on...  How much money are you spending on?  Too much money.  Oh, my God.  One day.  Oh, my God.  For one day.  I'm married.  It was a lot of money.  Well, you should have worked it. 
[03:55:30]  You could get married.  I mean, look.  You could fucking be driving a Porsche right now if you wanted to.  Instead, you fucking pay for one day at a catering hall.  Right.  With a side of a family that you probably can't even stand.  I mean, some people could, like...  At a catering hall.  And some shitty DJ playing the chicken dance.  While everybody just gets, you know, do-it-yourself chicken cutlets.  Dude, it's crazy.  Don't do it.  Just stay engaged.  But don't you think? 
[03:56:00]  Renew your engagement vows every six years.  Yeah, I see.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, but most girls would probably be like, yeah, I'm not satisfied with that, I don't  think.  Because they want to get married.  Yeah.  Because then they turn around and you take them to dinner and go, listen, I didn't tell  you this before we got married.  I'm fucking crazy.  Right.  Right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't let you know.  I found that shit out before I got married.  No, no.  We found another...  It goes to another level.  Oh, good.  There you agree.  They take their skin off and then they're just...  They even look different.  But see, that didn't happen with my wife.  I think you made a poor life choice. 
[03:56:30]  What's wrong, Nicole?  I don't know.  That's Ronnie from New Jersey Shore.  Oh, it's Ronnie.  Oh.  She's like looking at the side of your face while you're talking like, who the fuck is  that?  You know what's funny?  You're the only Jersey Shore that we never interviewed.  Yeah, they were saying that before.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah.  Well, you guys waited this long.  Shit.  Dude.  I've been around for five years.  I've not been doing nothing to you.  No, I wanted you like...  Like when the show was on, like I kept being like, is Ronnie coming in? 
[03:57:00]  Is Ronnie coming in?  And then Ryan never came in.  Sorry, I have laryngitis.  Yeah, she's on the air.  And I'm on the radio.  Yeah.  Perfect.  You got some...  What are those, hangover cure drinks?  No, no, no.  I'm not hungover.  I just...  Well, I mean, it's suspicious.  But my boss knows that sometimes I'm a little too intoxicated, so he gave me these drinks.  That's very nice of him.  Isn't that sweet?  The Cuban was just saying...  When you got married, Nicole...  Oh, she's going to love this conversation.  Well, she's married.  This is the Cuban.  Do you know the Cuban?  Is he a fucking name?  His name's the Cuban.  Just the Cuban.  El Cubano.  El Cubano.  By the way, Jay-Z and Beyonce visited your homeland. 
[03:57:30]  How great was that?  Fuck that.  Yeah, you think so?  You're a very negative guy, Cuban.  You're lucky I'm not judged yet.  I'd love to fucking laugh at you.  God damn it.  That's not funny, Cuban.  Too soon.  That's horrible.  Too soon.  Took it too far.  You know, by the way, if they were still doing the season of the Jersey Shore, after  Beyonce and Jay-Z got all that hype, they'd be like, guys, we're putting you all together  for one more season, the Jersey Shore in Cuba.  Right.  Who's down?  Would you do it?  Fuck that. 
[03:58:00]  You would do it?  Fuck that.  You're trying to get kidnapped.  No, fuck out of here.  You're trying to get kidnapped my ass.  Yeah.  Real quick.  I'm trying to get kidnapped me.  They're just going to hide in your luggage trying to get here.  So, the Cuban.  He's got a really big fight with Matt.  Okay, keep going.  With your husband?  Yeah, but we're going to talk about it.  Oh, she's going to love this conversation.  No, no, no.  I'm glad that you brought that up.  It fits right in.  It fits right in.  Okay, what's going on?  Because the Cuban said that he was advising Ronnie not to marry Sam.  He says, never get married.  He says he advised everyone to never, ever get married.  I don't know you personally, but from watching you, if you fight like that before, I mean, 
[03:58:30]  most likely you're going to end up beating the shit out of each other.  Really?  You're going to win the fight, but that's not the point.  Wow.  I just feel like it's just, if it's that bad before, you know.  First of all, I think you guys are the cutest couple ever.  Well, no, a lot of that shit was provoked.  Like, the producers provoked all the time.  Why don't you hug each other a little bit?  Why don't you nuzzle a little bit?  It was more like, how about we sit you down in a house and force Sam to watch season two,  and then you guys can't leave that night.  Oh, that's messed up shit. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, that's right.  So it's like, because we always have stay-home nights.  It was Wednesday and Sunday.  Meanwhile, we were never allowed to watch TV at all throughout.  No computers, no cell phones.  But that season, they were like, fuck it.  Let Sam see everything he did in fucking Miami.  Oh, and by the way, by the way, guys, you can't go out tonight.  So, yeah, go deal with it upstairs.  You know what?  That makes more sense.  And that's not fair.  The producer said you had to have stay-home nights?  Yeah, stay-home nights, and they would show it.  Is that their idea of being responsible?  It's not even they would show it, and then I can go to karma and be like, fuck, I get drunk.  It's like, no, now you're going to go upstairs and fight about it. 
[03:59:30]  Because they make it look like you're, they make it look like.  We just decided to stay home.  Yeah, like, oh, fuck you.  Something just happened.  I'm going to stay home and destroy her shit.  I like that that's their idea of being, like, responsible, though.  Like, yeah, I mean, yeah, they're drinking themselves to death, but we give them two stay-home nights.  So, you know, it's not our fault.  Those are the worst nights, because we end up almost killing each other, every one of us.  Ronnie, I understand everything you're saying.  Wait, can I find out what?  The Cuban said, he said that when you get married, the girl that you married, it's a regular thing with women.  It hasn't happened to me with my wife yet. 
[04:00:00]  I feel like I knew her very well before we got married.  But they, Cuban says that eventually, usually sooner than later, all women, when you take them out to dinner, will remove a layer of their skin and allow you to know I'm a crazy psychopathic bitch.  What's the, what do you mean remove a layer of skin?  Like a monster.  Like you get crazier after you get married.  Right, like, I don't know if you thought this was me, but this is me.  That's me a little bit.  That happened?  That's me a little bit, yeah.  What are you guys fighting about? 
[04:00:30]  We just, I just feel like he's on edge, he's a little cranky, and then he takes it on me, because, you know, you take it out on the person that you, that you're caught by.  It's closest to you.  And I said, listen, go fuck yourself.  And I left the apartment last night.  The thing is, is once you.  Okay, how is he being cranky then?  If you said go fuck yourself and left the apartment.  I let, I let a few comments go.  Pay attention, Ron.  Yeah.  No, I know, you just gotta walk away sometimes.  I had to walk away or I was gonna knock him out.  Yeah, you would have knocked him out.  100%.  What was the fight about?  They're married. 
[04:01:00]  But they're married.  That's what I'm telling you.  It wasn't a specific fight.  I just kept being like, is everything okay?  Like, you look, you seem like you're about to go postal.  Like, what's going on?  And then it's just like.  I think the more you ask him, it irritates us the more.  Right.  Instead of like just letting him relax, it's like you guys.  And we know you come, it comes from the heart, but it's like, you're like, what's wrong?  It's like, you're right there.  I want to talk about it.  You're right there.  And you're like, I got my shit in control.  I got my shit in control.  I'm almost.  Are you okay?  You want to talk about it?  I was until you fucking asked me that question. 
[04:01:30]  Listen, it's like, it's for example, say my wife, when she was my girlfriend, was here  and knew all of us.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, as long as we're dating, she would say something nice and negative.  The minute you get married, it's just negative.  How about your friends?  Oh, your friends.  Oh, he's funny, but I don't like, you know, what he does or whatever.  Right.  Once you're married, all bets are off.  It was funny.  I just don't know if it was appropriate.  I'm like, you know, who are you with?  Roland, fuck that guy.  And then who are you with?  She's a coke whore.  I know exactly what you're going to do. 
[04:02:00]  He's a closet homo.  Your friends are horrible.  I've never liked them.  Your mother's a whore.  What the fuck?  I'm pretty sure I didn't marry that woman.  You told me six months ago we were cool.  They weren't cool.  She's like, oh, your friend, yo, he likes talking to girls.  Your friend's a whore.  He's going to die of AIDS.  Cuban, it sounds like you got the wool pulled over your eyes a little bit there.  It sounds like you took a couple of layers off. 
[04:02:30]  You know what, though?  Some of it is stuff that happens to me, and some of it I'm talking as a composite when  I sit with my friends.  I'm like, what happened?  Dude, my wife just killed my best friend.  You're like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  The hope you die from AIDS thing is a little harsh, but one of my faves is I hope you step  on a rusty nail.  Yeah.  What?  Tetanus.  What are you, a seven?  No.  I hope you, what are you, is he a poor thing?  I hope you step on an airplane toilet.  And you catch something.  I hope you get bit by a black mamba. 
[04:03:00]  I don't want you to die, but I just want you to go through a lot of pain.  Tetanus sucks, dude.  Yeah, but there's so many things that are worse than tetanus.  Even AIDS, you don't fuck around with.  Couldn't you be like, oh, I hope you get paper cuts between your fingers.  Wait, aside now.  Magic Johnson would have died if he had tetanus.  He'll never die.  No amount of money will save you from tetanus.  He has no HIV in his body at all.  It's just gone, which means we have a cure.  We just don't have enough money to get it.  I don't imagine.  You just got to be really rich.  Okay, he passed it around. 
[04:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can I just tell you something really quickly, because this is funny?  Please do.  So I just screamed at him before I walked in and then said, all right, fuck you.  And then I hung up.  And then he wrote, well, that wasn't very good communication.  He's right.  He's right.  And I'm glad that he's being the bigger person.  Can't you look at TV and say, look at these horrible things going on in Boston.  I can't believe maybe it's time we come together, get close to our loved ones.  No, you're like, fuck it, I hate you.  Right, no.  She's doing the jerk-off gesture.  Fuck you, dude.  You're thinking no. 
[04:04:00]  No, and this is the best part.  I hope we make up before you come over for dinner tonight.  I thought I was thinking.  Aw, because then it's awkward.  Yeah.  But you know what else?  You don't hate him, and then it's like.  I'll just get loaded, and I'll feel better.  Ronnie, let me ask you.  Sam is getting into a big fight with you, right?  And she leaves the house.  She goes to work.  If she goes to work, and she's wearing a t-shirt with one of her close friends, who's also a co-worker's, face on the t-shirt, wouldn't that piss you off a little bit? 
[04:04:30]  My boy.  I'm kind of worried that her husband isn't going to be exactly thrilled.  That's because she's married and do crazy stuff.  Wouldn't that piss you off if your wife was like, I'm going to work?  If the guy was good-looking, then it would work.  So in this case, he's fine.  He's cool.  Like if she's wearing a Sam Roberts t-shirt.  John Cena t-shirt.  If it was like Channing Tatum, we're like, fine.  I'd be like, I'm like, I wonder where our head's at.  Fine.  But if you're just throwing my goofy mug on a t-shirt, we're safe.  We're all good.  I think so.  That's his shopping buddy. 
[04:05:00]  What's he going to like her photo on Instagram?  Sam tries on my blouses so he can try double the stuff on in the store half amount of time.  I make him model jeans for me.  I think you're very sexy, Sam.  You do?  And that's why I rock the shirt.  You think it?  What did you say?  Absolutely.  I think you're very sexy and that's why I rock the shirt.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Actually, I'm going to make him even more.  I'm going to wear it to bed.  Oh, God.  No wonder or anything.  Okay.  Now.  Now.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll take it.  I'll accept it. 
[04:05:30]  I'm all in.  I think it's the way to go, but I think I am going to lose a friend in your husband and I'm  okay with that.  Oh, he loves me.  I'm okay with that.  He's married.  He doesn't even have the power not to be a friend.  She'll tell him.  He's our friend.  Shut the fuck up.  He's our friend.  Oh, be nice to Sam.  Be nice.  He's our friend now.  You guys do great impersonations.  I got a ton of friends.  I don't even.  I hate them.  My wife says those are my new friends.  Well.  I'm like, that guy smells.  I don't want to hang out.  They're really her friend.  That's why.  You know.  Shitty dudes.  The one woman in your life that you always have to remember isn't your wife. 
[04:06:00]  It's your mom.  And you know Mother's Day is coming up, don't you?  I love this.  My mom's a hater.  You love your mom, Cuban?  Your mom's a hater.  Yeah.  She's in life or she hates you?  She hates everything.  She does.  Well, maybe you just haven't given her the right gift.  You think that's what it is?  Lucky for you.  Lucky for you.  Oh, so there is a gift that's going to change.  Cuban.  Lucky for you.  I've got the perfect gift.  A trip to Watertown.  No.  How dare you?  How dare you?  Oh, my God. 
[04:06:30]  Too soon.  No.  That's two.  No.  That's two.  Horrible.  I don't stand by that statement at all.  This is the last time he'll be on this show.  What I was trying to say was, it's obviously Steven Singer's famous gold dip roses, of course.  Oh, yes.  Obviously.  Sorry.  I mean, it's the perfect gift for your mom, your mother-in-law, the mother of your children.  Ronnie, if you've got any sort of baby mamas floating around out there that you need to make good with.  They don't ship to Mexico.  Oh, yes.  So you're good.  It's a real long stem rose, and it's dipped in 24 karat pure gold. 
[04:07:00]  It lasts forever, and it's only 69 bucks.  Yeah.  Only 69 bucks.  Steven Singer's real long stem roses come shipped in a beautiful gift box with your own personalized Mother's Day card.

Order your Mother's Day rose.  What a fantastic idea.  It might be something that your husband wants to try out, Nicole.  A dip of a rose.  Whatever happens to her red roses and pink roses?  No, they need to be gold. 
[04:08:00]  They need to be zip.  Really expensive jewelry.  Oh, now you're going to do something.  She's mad at her husband.  And can I tell you something?  Do it, Ronnie.  She's angry.  I know that there was some kind of fight last week, too.  I don't know anything about it.  But I know that something happened.  Because on Nicole's Instagram, she posted a new Hermes bracelet.  It's not Hermes.  It's Hermes.  It's Hermes.  Get it right.  Says the girl with laryngitis.  I'm sorry.  Don't try to teach me about class with your fucking hangover prevention drinks in front  of you, okay?  And your lighter. 
[04:08:30]  You love me.  Fuck out of here.  Getting ready for later, baby.  Well, I know you like to drink.  Ronnie can help you out with that.  Yeah.  Ronnie's got smooshed cocktails.  Yeah, I just came out with my own liquor.  You did?  Yeah, 34 calories.  No sugar.  No preservatives.  I need it.  Now.  Can I have one?  Yeah, you can take them.  Wait, Ronnie, come over to dinner.  We'll make cocktails with your, uh...  They're pre-made already.  Mojito, Cosmopolitan, margarita, and an apple martini.  Whoa, is that...  All right, so you got the Cosmo, the margarita, the mojito...  And the apple martini. 
[04:09:00]  And the apple martini.  We're working on a sangria as well.  Are they delicious?  That's it right there, the sangria.  You want to try?  They're going to have them, bro.  They're really good.  I don't drink.  They're really, really good.  But Roland drinks a lot.  I'll leave the bottle with you guys, and you guys test them out around the place.  Oh, we absolutely will.  Let me know how you like them.  Sirius XM is going to have some fucked up employees today.  I'm me, me, I'm me.  You're going to be drinking today?  You know, alcohol clears.  Does it?  Perfect.  Let's bring it on.  Let's bust open the box.  Let's bust open the box.  What'd you bring in?  I brought...  I'm so excited. 
[04:09:30]  Laryngitis medicine.  Oh, you brought them all in.  I have to work out later.  Do you think I can sober up before then?  It's only 34 calories.  You don't have to work out later, Nicole.  Oh, honey, this one's mine.  Look at this.  Oh, honey, this one's also mine.  Smush cocktails.  Actually, these are the two I really want, because I'm like...  Margaritas in the summertime is, like, the best.  Roland, what do you want?  I'm going to take Nicole's.  No, you're not.  That's just evil.  Well, it's called...  Go back to your own show.  Whoa!  I was invited on this show, Roland.  True.  And guess what?  You still owe me lunch, so shop. 
[04:10:00]  What's shop?  Shop.  I tried to go shut up, and then I was going to say zip it, and then shop came out.  Yeah, and then you said it again as if it was something, but it wasn't.  Shut up!  Roland owes you lunch.  That means I'll be getting a call.  And, you know, the guys want lunch, so I was thinking...  They don't.  The guys couldn't be less interested in the food.  I know.  I got some cocktails for tonight.  Where can they get Smush cocktails?  Right now, it's available in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  We're working on Florida.  If you want to buy it online, you go to SmushCocktail.com.  We deliver to 29 states.  And it's S-M-U-S-H. 
[04:10:30]  Yes.  Guaranteed to get you Smushed?  Oh, definitely.  Definitely, right?  It's been proven in the past.  And you get it at bars and stuff?  I'm not sure I'm working on it, yeah.  It just came out last month, so we're really just...  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Smush Cocktails, Ronnie.  Thank you for hanging out.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Enjoy them.  Cuban, I don't want you back here.  You're inappropriate.  I'm sorry.  You said some things that are really nasty.  I drank all Smush all morning.  Yeah, you're obviously intoxicated.  Smushed out.  And you should be ashamed of yourself.  Thank you.  And your bad husband.  And thank you, Nicole. 
[04:11:00]  Oh, you're welcome.  I hope everything works out just fine with your husband until your next fight.  Before dinner tonight?  Yeah.  We'll see you on Monday.  Goodbye, everybody.
