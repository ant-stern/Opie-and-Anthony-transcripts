<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM202 broadcast began with a satirical segment mocking the notion of "nice" radio, seguing into discussions of their recurring segments, "Phone Call Thursday" and "Perv News."  A substantial portion focused on a heated phone conversation with John Minnelli, their former program director at Free FM (later K-Rock), who had recently been let go.  Minnelli, having sent a scathing multi-page email criticizing the show's post-format-change direction, engaged in a highly contentious exchange with Opie and Anthony.  The conversation was filled with profanity and accusations. Minnelli claimed the show lacked energy and had compromised its comedic style due to increased sensitivities, while Opie and Anthony defended their adaptation to the changing radio landscape and their continued success, citing their recent successful Jones Beach live event.  The argument encompassed recriminations over past professional decisions, including Opie’s role in Minnelli's appointment, and touched upon other on-air personalities like JV and Elvis, Ron and Fez, and Nick DiPaolo, as well as their near-firing from XM and the station's recent format shift.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the underreported violence following Juneteenth celebrations, particularly focusing on a fatal attack on a Hispanic man.  Opie and Anthony, along with a caller named Brendan, expressed outrage at the media's perceived bias in coverage. They criticized the lack of condemnation from figures like Reverend Al Sharpton regarding black-on-black or black-on-Hispanic violence.  This segment further included a continued critique of John Minnelli's assessment of the show's performance, with Opie and Anthony highlighting their constraints due to evolving social and political sensitivities, referencing sensitivity training in *Rescue Me* as an example. The segment concluded with a humorous anecdote about a nude couple falling to their deaths from a building roof, listener calls, and promotion of Bruce Willis's new movie and Ron and Fez's upcoming wedding.

Further conflict with Minnelli dominated another segment, focusing on his critical memo and perceived hypocrisy. Opie and Anthony highlighted their past, more unrestrained style at a previous station and the limitations imposed by political correctness.  This section also included tangents about racial humor in television,  promotion of their Mohegan Sun comedy show, a humorous anecdote about their former boss Ken, a critique of a co-host's fruit choices, and a significant feud with Chicago radio host Mike North.  The feud involved Opie and Anthony’s retaliatory posting of offensive messages in North's PalTalk chat room, resulting in their expulsion and temporary ban from the platform. This led to listener calls discussing the events and several humorous listener names being mentioned.  A phone call with Mike North occurred at the end of this segment. Other topics included listener calls (both positive and negative), a news story about a Pennsylvania crossing guard facing sex charges, a story about a New Jersey lawyer's lewd behavior, and technical issues with the show’s phone lines and studio audio.

Another segment featured an angry reaction to a perceived slight from another radio show, which the hosts believed falsely claimed to have rebuffed them for an interview.  Profane insults were exchanged, and this led into various listener calls. Topics ranged from a negative opinion of the show’s current state to Continental Airlines (and overflowing toilets on a flight), baseball (Chicago White Sox and Cubs), and sports in general. The segment included discussion of PalTalk, a humorous anecdote about a caller’s uncle becoming a fan, and a call from Opie and Anthony themselves, leading to further banter about PalTalk and a humorous discussion about a potential “room raid.” The segment concluded with the hosts' girlfriend calling in unexpectedly, resulting in a sexually suggestive conversation with various animalistic and childish sounds.

The final segment included a vulgar game involving on-air personalities subtly displaying their genitalia to a camera ("pal-toe camera").  This transitioned into a discussion of a transatlantic flight with malfunctioning toilets and sewage spilling into the cabin, followed by shared anecdotes of unpleasant bathroom experiences.  The hosts then discussed upcoming show segments, including "Camel Toe Thursday," and read and discussed several "line of the day" contenders before concluding the show with the host mentioning an upcoming wedding.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[00:00:30]  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.

[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Charles Nelson Reilly takes it up the blank.  The blank.  Can I call a friend and maybe get some aid with this?  Oh, well.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is where entertainment is going.  I'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers.  I think your dad's just a watcher.  He just sits in the corner nude.  And also it's a horrific face for having to your mom.  They are sick.  Freak.  Don't you ever do that.  I understand the concept of the syllables.  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt. 
[00:01:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  What is it?  Thursday?  It's Thursday.  Yes.  And that means it's phone call Thursday.  Phone call. 
[00:02:00]  I had a few issues with phone call Thursday yesterday during our big promo.  It's phone call Thursday.  It's fun fact Thursday.  Fun fact Thursday.  This is what radio has become.  Right.  And we're going to get a little saucy and do perv news.  Perv news.  Perv news Thursday.  Oh.  Yes.  How much perv news is there?  There are a lot of perv news?  Yeah, we collect them.  Oh, yeah.  I just got a big thumbs up. 
[00:02:30]  I think we got three or four today.  Good.  Perv news.  That I like.  You like perv news?  I'm still on the fence with phone call Thursday.  I don't even understand the concept.  We take calls every day of the week.  Why is Thursday special with phone call Thursday?  Well, we take a couple extra calls.  A couple of extras?  We allow like Cleveland and, I don't know, Grand Rapids.  Grand Rapids to call the show on Thursday.  Good for them. 
[00:03:00]  Participate.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Welcome.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  Yes, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  It's just the email that Steve sent about our invite.  Oh.  As a show.  I saw that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We got a lot of emails overnight.  Got my friends invited to a black tie event.  Oh.  Do you own a black tie suit?  Is that a tux? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  No.  No.  If you get married or die, I show up in the same outfit.  An Aussie shirt?  I have one suit.  One Joseph of Booth, whatever his name is.  Foreign man.  Booth.  Foreign man, good clothes.  Whatever his name is.  I can't pronounce his name, but I will say he has nice clothes and I wear them to everything  I have.  One suit.  Uh-oh.  One suit for every occasion.  Whoa.  Look out.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Watch it.  I don't know if Tom's going to come in and smack Jimmy in the head.  Why?  I got the plug wrong. 
[00:04:00]  Where do we begin today?  It's also douche Thursday.  Yeah.  I guess there's some bitter people out there.  I don't know.  What can I tell you?  Bitter, bitter, bitter people.  I got a guy a job.  It didn't work out.  He gets fired.  And now he's attacking me personally.  He's attacking all of us.  Well, he's been attacking all of us.  Well, now he's decided because I haven't really, really, like, written him back or call him. 
[00:04:30]  No, he's been attacking me all along, Anthony.  Just figured he's, um.  And now he's decided to throw everybody into the mix.  Just figured.  I wrote it off as, uh, yeah, uh, he's bitter.  Um, yeah, he, uh.  I was going to write him back and just say, I get it.  You're bitter.  It didn't work out.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  But why are you killing me?  I was the one that went to Tom at the time and said, yeah, he would make a great PD for this place.  Right.  It is a known fact I got him the job. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, Opie got him the job.  Opie, don't get any more people jobs.  Please.  I get under people's skin to the point that they just feel like they have to just kill me after they, uh, you know, leave this place.  Well, we're talking about douche John Minnelli.  Former friend, former phony backstabbing friend John Minnelli, who is now on the complete douche list.  Uh, what an ass this guy is. 
[00:05:30]  When he was here as program director of our station in New York, when it was the, um, Free FM, when it was called Free FM, before it went back to what it is now, K-Rock, uh, where it's us in the morning, music the rest of the day.  It was one of these, uh, uh, uh, free FM stations where it's, um, us in the morning talking and then more talk shows all throughout the day and night and talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  So, um, we, uh, had no, no PD at the time when we came in and a lot of suggestions were going around. 
[00:06:00]  Uh, Tom consulted us and, uh, asked for some suggestions and, uh, said, you know, John Minnelli, good guy, knows talk radio.  We have a good, uh, uh, rapport with the guy, uh, bring, bring him in.  And Tom's like, all right, you know, I'll put him on the list.  We'll think about it.  And, uh, that's what happened.  They, they hired John Minnelli to be the program director of Free FM here in New York City. 
[00:06:30]  And we go back years with John Minnelli.  Yeah, he wrote for the Post.  He, he always wrote about the show favorably when he wrote for the Post.  We give him little inside scoops on things that were happening, you know, things, things like that.  And, uh, when Howard had his problems with John Minnelli and it, it led to him being fired by the Post,  we gave him a voice to trash Howard and speak his mind.  We've always been there for him.  And, uh, it didn't work out with, uh, Free FM.  No.  And, and he thinks that it's so weird where this is coming from because he thinks we trashed Free FM when this went back to music. 
[00:07:00]  We really didn't trash, uh, Free FM when this place went back to music.  We're very happy that it went back to music.  I personally think if there's less talk shows on a radio station, that gives you a chance to succeed as a show.  Absolutely.  But we supported, uh, a lot of the shows that were in place.  Matter of fact, we got, uh, suspended for, for basically sticking up for JV and Elvis when they went through their troubles.  Right. 
[00:07:30]  Exactly.  We were supporting Ron and Fez, who are really good friends of ours.  Yeah.  One of the few radio shows that, that we get along with.  We hated the fact that, uh, in New York, Ron and Fez were doing, uh, a show here on, on, uh, K-Rock.  What it is now, K-Rock.  But, uh, because they went to music, they had to go.  Unfortunately, I love those guys.  But it's part of the, it's part of the business.  The, the fact that this guy doesn't seem to understand the radio business is mind-boggling to me. 
[00:08:00]  When, uh, station, uh, flips format, regardless of your opinion, there are people that are, um, thinking that not enough time was given to the format, to the talk format, that, uh, the people, uh, in charge didn't have enough power to put people in or take shows out or something.  Regardless of all of that, it's radio.  It's this business.  We can be gone, uh, tomorrow.  We've always said that.  It almost happened recently.  A lot of things happen. 
[00:08:30]  It's this stupid business.  And then, when, uh, uh, John Minnelli gets, uh, let go because they change formats.  He's not a rock music, uh, uh, program director.  He's a talk guy.  Uh, he gets let go.  Now, as a courtesy, the guy was allowed to come in that last day during the flip, uh, go into the conference room where all the staff of, uh, the station here and, uh, Tom Chiasano and everybody were talking about, um, how the station will flip, uh, the stunting that went on before it. 
[00:09:00]  And gave John Minnelli such props.  It was amazing.  Tom just stood there and talked about what a great job Tom did, uh, uh, John did.  Unfortunately, we're going in another direction, but he did a really good job, blah, blah, blah.  And, uh, everything seemed fine.  Well, since that day, he's done nothing but bash the crap out of this program, out of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:30]  Um, didn't have the courage or whatever to face us and actually let all this out when, when he worked for us, when, when his job was to critique the show.  Um, he barely opened his yap, but now that, um, he's not working, uh, he sends email after email that, that we haven't even responded to.  So, it's like, who cares?  But now, this last one is like three pages of just this bitter sarcasm. 
[00:10:00]  It's all this, like, sarcasm and, and just, uh, he, he titled it his final critique.  Well, I, I hope so.  Because you can really stop listening to the show anytime you want there, uh, John.  Yeah, if he sucks so bad, why are you listening every day?  Yeah.  Why are you staying up at night?  I know he records the show and, and, and type out these emails and like, and I think it was at one 30 in the morning, uh, when he sent this one.  And he's one of these guys, he hides behind his computer. 
[00:10:30]  It's like, we do everything face to face.  He has my phone numbers.  If he had a problem with me personally, he could have certainly called my cell phone.  He did in the past.  Yeah.  You know, he could call the radio show, but instead he hides behind a keyboard and is all brave and, and, uh, writing out what's wrong with the radio show.  And taking all these weird shots at, at every single person in this room right now, no respect whatsoever for this guy.  And if, uh, I, it's so weird.  I get myself in situations where I think I know people and then I realized, wow, did I make a huge mistake? 
[00:11:00]  That's why.  Let me, let me, let me tell you something I learned so early on in the stupid ass radio business.  Management is never your friend.  They are management.  You can be friendly with them, which I am.  I'm friendly with, uh, Tom.  Uh, I like Tom.  Um, I, I'm friendly with, uh, Eric Logan, probably more so than any other management guy that, um, I've ever worked for because, you know, we've gone out and, um, had some drinks and stuff like that. 
[00:11:30]  But always in the back of my head is the guy is management.  He'll do, he'll do his best for, for this program.  But if push comes to shove, you must remember they are management and you are the employee, period.  No one's going to be sticking their neck out or, or their job on the line when push comes to shove.  Uh, you'll be out the door, uh, you'll be reprimanded.  You'll be suspended.  You'll be fired.  Whatever it is, management's here. 
[00:12:00]  We are here.  And there's no big socializing.  There's no friends.  I don't go over their house.  I don't frigging, you know, I keep things very, very light with them.  That's the way to do it because in the end you're going to get someone like John Dushmanelli, uh, who, who comes across like your pal when he's talking to you, shaking hands, uh, uh, oh, you're getting the, uh, the little, um, chat after the show.  Hey guys, how you doing? 
[00:12:30]  In a meeting, he'll talk about, um, issues with the program, which is fine, but not like this, you know, until he doesn't work anymore, until he doesn't have a job anymore.  And then where are the asses?  And we suck.  And, uh, everything we're doing is apparently, uh, wrong, bad, uh, you want, you want to get into reading this?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, it's, it's a scream.  It's just, it's just amazing.  See if you can pick out the sarcasm.  It's hard.  You really have to know sarcasm to pick it out. 
[00:13:00]  It doesn't come right at you and smack you in the face.  I have a feeling he wanted us to go down with the ship.  Yeah, yeah, that's what he wanted.  And unfortunately, we didn't believe in the ship enough to go down with the ship.  I mean, he couldn't, uh, in all fairness to John Minnelli, he, he personally, um, hated some of the shows on the air and wanted to make some changes.  But, uh, he didn't like, uh, that JV and Elvis were after us.  He wanted them an afternoon drive.  He hated the radio chick.  He was, he was trying to get, uh, the radio chick fired. 
[00:13:30]  We stayed out of all that, obviously.  Yep.  Uh, uh, but he couldn't get any of this stuff done.  He also said if JV and Elvis got fired, he would quit immediately, which never, ever happened.  Well, that didn't happen.  What happened there?  And we stood up as much as we could for some of the shows around here.  We supported Ron and Fez.  We didn't know much about Nick DiPaolo, but we liked what he was doing with his, uh, radio show.  And we wish him nothing but the best in thought and think that he should get another shot at doing this.  I think Nick will do great, uh, on radio somewhere else.  Doing this, uh, talk format.  Uh, you know, and, and we, we pretty much almost got fired for, you know, sticking up for JV and Elvis because we thought it was the right thing to do. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You know, besides that, it was a complete disaster.  It just wasn't working because he wasn't allowed to make the moves he wanted to make.  Yeah, we'll be honest.  And, and, and the station just wasn't tracking, uh, the last trend, cause he'll get into details.  Uh, the, the station actually did pretty well, but it was one month out of, uh, out of many that weren't too, too, too good whatsoever.  And it was still, it was, the station still wasn't in any, uh, position to, to continue as a, as a, as a talk station. 
[00:14:30]  Those are the facts.  So when, when, when, you know, when the format changed and we survived, we were, we were happy.  We were happy to see, you know, see what the next, the next, uh, the next thing would be for us.  Uh, you know, but we think that us in mornings with music is, is a much better fit at this point.  And I guess John would have wanted us to just throw ourselves on our swords and, uh, what?  Sacrifice ourselves, not have a job here, not, uh, uh, stay on. 
[00:15:00]  No.  What kind of point is that making?  No, I mean, we're, we're excited that we're, we're the morning show here in New York, but, uh, we're, we're also on another 20 some odd stations across America and we're on, uh, XM satellite radio.  So, you know, you know, uh, our world is a lot bigger than John Minnelli's.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Uh, Greg, he does, he does address it to you, by the way, even though he, um, he bashes everybody in here, but, uh, it's addressed to you. 
[00:15:30]  I've been listening and I thought I'd, uh, give you one last critique for old time's sake.  I'll keep it real simple.  Like you like them.  Uh, ready?  Oh, why is Tom saying not to read the, the Minnelli email?  Holy Jesus Christ.  Why is he saying?  Why?  It's an email to Opie.  It says Greg.  It said, uh, the answer I was given was it was a private conversation and unless something shows up in the papers, uh, to stay off of it. 
[00:16:00]  Wait, wait, what?  No, no, no.  This is silly.  This is stupid.  It's a, Tom, why is this not, it's an email to Greg.  It says, Greg, he's sharing a call.  We're sharing a correspondence by John Minnelli.  It was a private correspondence, right?  It doesn't say keep this private.  It does not say keep this private.  It's an email.  If, if you get a letter, you should be able to read it.  If you get an email, unless it says do not read this on the air. 
[00:16:30]  Unless there are other things in place that.  I got it.  I got the same email.  It was CC to me.  I understand.  I, you got to make me understand this because I really want to read this to show what an ass this guy is.  Then I need to talk to you off the air.  Oh my God.  This is why this place sucks.  Oh, the lawyers get involved with everything.  No, Tom, F you.  No, F you.  This is interesting stuff for, for our listeners.  F you.  F you.  We've been reading emails for years and have never had a problem.  Never.  There's nothing personal in here. 
[00:17:00]  It's all about our radio show.  It's a critique of our radio show.  We should be able to read this on the air.  It wasn't.  You might as well do, you might as well do 92 minute music blocks in the morning.  That'll be, that'll be safe and keep everybody's jobs.  No.  No, F you.  We can read this on the air.  We've read a million of these on the air over the years and never had a problem.  What's the, um, what's the, what, what, what, what is there to be afraid of if we read this?  A lawsuit from John against the company or us or something? 
[00:17:30]  We've made an agreement.  With who?  Him.  Okay.  That.  To not disparage.  Disparage.  I never read the agreement.  I didn't sign the agreement.  I never heard about an agreement.  Perhaps if an agreement was made that we, we maybe should have been informed.  Well, now, now I'm informing.  Well, this is a little, little late.  I mean, I didn't know you were going to take a private email and turn it into a public conversation.  It, it actually, to me, is, it becomes our property when he emails it to us. 
[00:18:00]  I would like you, if you could.  Sure.  I'd be happy to read.  To get in touch with Lehrman.  Sure.  And, and, and, without throwing any bias in.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Get, get the information we need.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  You don't, you see, you need to say no more.  I really want to read this.  Okay.  I assume, and my, my take on this, and I'm no lawyer, I understand.  Okay.  Is that it is, it is our property as an email that hasn't been, if there was a note attached 
[00:18:30]  on the bottom, do not read this on the air.  This is a private correspondence between blah, blah, blah.  I got it.  I, I, I absolutely, you know, I, I, I get it.  You, you may be right.  I got it.  Now I want to do some homework.  Okay.  And I can do it.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  Um, by the way, disparage, disparaging.  Yes.  That had to go both ways, I would assume.  Yes.  Okay.  And that would include, um, does it include private emails?  Okay.  Does it include postings on message boards? 
[00:19:00]  Um, it may.  All right.  Because, uh, I never responded to his trashing he gave us on the New York radio message board.  I, I didn't know.  So perhaps that's a little disparaging.  And I, I was unaware there was one.  Yeah.  So that may change things.  Yeah.  I could say the guy's an ass in my humble opinion.  I, I could say I, I perceive him as being very two-faced.  Go check with the, uh, go check with our friends, the lawyers. 
[00:19:30]  Absolutely got you.  Uh, because I, as I see this, it's now our, our property to read.  It is as if, um, somebody sent us an email, because that's exactly what it was.  There was no, um, stipulations on there as to whether it could or couldn't be made public.  Um, that's how I say it.  I understand perfectly, and I promise that that will be done post-haste.  I know you're, you know, safe guy.  Well, I understand.  I'm a man, but I'm, I live up to my, to our agreements, and I have to make sure the company 
[00:20:00]  is up to its agreements, and that, in this case, may or may not include you.  I need to find that out.  Okay, check on that.  Yes, I will, sir.  Please.  Yes, sir.  And, uh, it sure reinforces a few things he writes in his email.  Yeah, yeah, I, I would, I would definitely, uh, appreciate if you would, um, check on that.  I will, as quickly as I possibly can, make those phone calls.  Thank you.  My pleasure.  May I, may I have a copy?  Oh, please.  Take it.  It's, uh, it makes great reading, whether it can be read on the air or off. 
[00:20:30]  It's a fantastic.  I'd say that, that kind of, that, that, that rabbit's already kind of out of the hat here  anyway, but.  Yeah.  It's a matter, now it becomes just a matter of degree.  What was he trying to taunt us?  I don't, I don't know.  Why doesn't he call?  Do you have his number?  I do.  We have his number.  Yeah.  Get him on the air.  That's what I say.  Get him on the air.  If he wants to get on the air and discuss this like a man, then he should do that. 
[00:21:00]  Then he should do that.  And we get the.  That's adding to the conversation.  No.  Oh, it's very angry.  Yes.  Morning, James.  Hello, Tom.  How are you this morning?  I'm okay.  I'm, you know, I'm having Blackberry difficulties.  It's probably not the time to mention them.  Who's your supplier?  No, don't mention that.  You didn't get the email? 
[00:21:30]  The suit plug was just fine, by the way.  What's that?  The suit plug was just fine.  No, we didn't get there.  Wow.  Look at the, look at the messages coming in.  Leave Tom.  Tom, get out of there.  You're ruining the show, Tom.  Am I dismissed?  Well, according to PalTalk, you should have been dismissed minutes ago.  All right.  In that case, I will leave.  Yeah.  Please get in touch with them.  Tail, not between my teeth, not between my leg.  No, they wouldn't fit between your teeth with the braces.  Oh, my God.  The tongue is hurting so bad today. 
[00:22:00]  We could discuss that for three hours.  That'll make good ratings.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, who knows?  I'll be back.  What does go with 18 exclamation points behind it mean?  I think it may mean.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Remember, he goes when he wants to.  So, we'll wait.  I'm leaving now.  And he'll leave when he wants to.  He told me that already.  F Tom, F Tom, F Tom, F Tom, F Tom.  That's from Doc Hayden.  Tom, you may leave now. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  Oh, I can't even read that one.  Easy, Opie.  Yeah, calm down.  I mean.  It's not your show, Tom.  I know it's not my show.  Believe me.  Let me go get to work here.  How about that?  Tom is the new Rune the Bit guy.  Leave a hole.  Tom needs herpes of the ass.  The listeners are really rallying behind you, Tom. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  Well, that I can't even say either.  It's that something of Opie's should be flung into your face.  Is that a multiple Nigs reference?  Right, it is.  Oh, Jesus.  Hello.  Okay.  Ah.  Hello.  Hello.  John.  All right, here we go.  John.  Yeah, I stayed up later than usual.  I was keyed up last night.  Did you, is there a problem? 
[00:23:30]  Let's start right off the bat.  Is there a problem with you, with us reading that email critique that you had sent us?  No, I don't care.  You can trash me all you want.  I'm a believer in total free speech.  Okay.  All right.  Then I apologize, boys.  All right.  Opie, I certainly apologize.  Sorry for ruining your morning, but...  Are you ready to leave yet?  Yes, I'm ready to leave right now.  I'm just wondering.  Okay.  All right.  Let's have a nice discussion about this situation. 
[00:24:00]  John, got your email, read through it.  Can't say I agree with it.  And I can't say that I understand where you're coming from with all of this.  When you worked here, we didn't really get the double barrel critique like you're giving in this email,  which leads me to believe there's a bit of sour grapes and bitterness going on here. 
[00:24:30]  There is definitely sour grapes and bitterness, although, as you may recall, a lot of the critiques I wrote when I was there, Opie didn't like them either.  But they were not as harsh as this one.  First of all, John, that's not true.  Joe, I didn't like everything you had to say, and we've had conversations that went past emails, and I told you what I liked about your critiques and what I didn't like about your critiques.  Yeah, well, in my view, the show has declined even more. 
[00:25:00]  And the reason that I am really annoyed...  Really? Did you see the last trend?  It was the best trend we've had since coming back to New York.  It's still not good.  It was through the roof, John.  It's not good.  It was a hell of a lot better than all the other shows you were supposed to be the program director for, right?  Those were brand new shows.  No, they weren't. Radio Chick was here way before us.  That was my show.  And JV and Elvis were here way before us, right?  That was not my show, but I was working on it. 
[00:25:30]  We were by far the most successful show on Free FM.  By far.  And John, why are you trashing me?  Do you realize I got you the gig in the end?  How about a little professional respect?  And I didn't play into your game.  You've been writing me these emails off and on since you got fired, and I left them alone, didn't I?  The only reason we're bringing this up today is because you got under Anthony's skin. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, well, that was the intent.  Why?  What's the point?  We get it.  You're bitter.  You lost your gig.  You want me to explain why I'm bitter?  Yeah, because the company didn't allow you to do what you wanted to do.  So leave us out of it.  No, no, that's a different...  And we didn't trash.  I know where you're going.  When this turned back to rock, we didn't trash Free FM.  Yeah, you did.  No, we didn't.  We supported Ron and Fez.  We supported JV and Elvis.  Because one of the things you bring up in the email is like, we're not Rebels anymore and we're playing it safe. 
[00:26:30]  Do you realize that we got suspended from XM for talking about JV and Elvis technically?  And then we almost got suspended from this station as well?  Look, XM makes a lot of decisions that I think are dumb.  And I don't have anything to do with them.  What really annoys me is I figure you guys cost me two sweet gigs now.  All right, the consulting figure at AEW because of St. Pat's, but I understand that.  In this case, I believe if you had performed up to what you can do, the station would have had more than enough momentum. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, you're going to blame the whole thing on us?  You're a hack, John.  You're a hack.  We're doing just fine here and growing every day.  You're a hack.  No.  You are a hack.  You're going to turn around and blame your failures on us?  Why don't you take it out on who you really pissed off, Tom and the company?  Because they wouldn't allow you to make the moves you wanted to make.  We had these conversations. 
[00:27:30]  You wanted JV and Elvis in Afternoon Drive.  You wanted to move Ron and Fez down.  And you wanted the radio chick gone.  That's the reason that this place didn't work.  Don't blame us.  That's why I'm upset at you.  Don't blame us.  You know, the angrier you get tells me there's more truth in my memo.  No, because I've had it with you.  You're a two-faced ass.  And you're also one of these guys, passive-aggressive, hiding behind your keyboards.  Hiding behind your keyboard in the middle of the night.  You have nothing better to do but listen to our show in the middle of the night and then 
[00:28:00]  type out these ridiculous, psychotic emails about our show.  How many of you had a format change for two weeks and didn't say anything to me?  You hid.  Why did you sneak around that way?  I didn't hide.  I didn't sneak around anywhere.  Yeah, you did.  You knew about it in advance.  You didn't say anything.  I knew about it probably the same time you did.  Oh, give me a break.  Probably.  No, probably.  Okay. 
[00:28:30]  Is that, John, let me just turn it around a little bit.  You've been in this radio business.  When a format is going to be changed or people are going to be let go and you know about  it, did you then go around and tell that talent that they were going to be let go or did you  wait until D-Day?  Be honest.  I didn't always tell the...  Most of the time, I did tell the talent because I trusted them.  Sometimes, if I didn't tell the talent, I wouldn't tell them.  A lot of times, your management would tell you something until you don't say anything because 
[00:29:00]  that's how phony radio works.  I understand that that's the way it works.  Most places I programmed, I did what I wanted.  John, I'm just trying to get to the point here of sometimes when a format is being changed,  you don't tell the people.  You don't tell the air staff.  That's how it is.  And then people get blown out.  It's the way radio works.  Yeah, well, I kind of think radio could work better.  Well, so do I.  Believe me, especially when you're on the receiving end of it. 
[00:29:30]  But the truth of the matter is, if somebody knows that there's going to be a format change,  it's not a license to go telling everybody that that's what's going to happen.  Because you know as well as I do that contracts are involved.  There's legal issues that are involved that keeps you from saying anything about program changes.  That's a minor point, Anthony.  It's not a minor point.  That's the whole issue that you just brought up.  I know who is your biggest fan for years, including in the newspaper.  Nobody knows better than me how good you guys can be. 
[00:30:00]  And nobody knows better than me that you're not even close to that.  You know something?  Listen, I'll even try to listen to that and grab a hold of it for a little bit.  But let me also explain this.  Do you agree that radio has changed so drastically these days that it is truly an effort to reinvent  your show, to do new things, to switch it around so you can stay in the environment and still be successful when you were doing one thing 
[00:30:30]  and now you, because of rules and regulations, and you have to then work around it?  You have to agree with that.  Not in your case.  In our case, we can do the same shows we did on NEW and have a job longer than a day?  No, no.  See, you missed the point of all those memos I wrote when I was there, which is that's not what made you guys what you are.  What you were was riffing on the news and stuff in life. 
[00:31:00]  See, that's your...  That's what the people want to hear.  If you didn't...  Oh, my God.  That was...  But aren't we...  That was one of the things our listeners liked.  They also liked the other stuff, but you personally did not like the other stuff.  John, we were also doing that.  What are we doing on a daily basis?  We're riffing on the news and talking about our personal lives.  That's pretty much what we do on this show.  You're not doing it with the pizzazz and...  I mean, Anthony, you never do hardly any voices anymore, hardly any sound effects. 
[00:31:30]  You just don't...  You're not on your toes.  And, Opie, you used to executive produce the show at NEW.  You can't hardly be bothered, you know, looking at the newspapers now.  Looking at the newspapers?  Executive produce the show?  Right, okay.  I'm not...  I didn't just buy papers this morning.  I can't understand that either.  And as far as a lot of that old material, we can't even play that on this show.  The Mike Tyson bit. 
[00:32:00]  Let's take that as an example of something that was very popular in the NEW days, but not now.  Do you realize how much of that would be considered now racist humor that could get us thrown off the air, sexist?  A lot of that material wasn't just the impression and the brilliance that is me that was behind it.  It's the content which now is being prohibited because of interest groups and corporate fear or whatever it is. 
[00:32:30]  That's just the world we live in, John.  And it makes it more difficult to do radio, not impossible.  And that is what we're doing.  We're working the show to fit in to terrestrial radio in this day and age.  If at some point someone else gets into office, it lightens up a little, you'll see the Chinese delivery guy character I used to do come back.  Mike Tyson's character will be able to come back and do the sexist, racist stuff that we used to do with that impression. 
[00:33:00]  You just...  It's a different world, John.  Why?  I don't understand.  The richer people get, the more timid they get.  It's not richer or timid.  It's about keeping our job, John.  It's about...  There's a line that has to be straddled.  It's called putting on entertaining radio and keeping your job.  If you do both, it doesn't mean you've sold out on either.  We're not selling out and doing a piss-poor show because we're listening to the man. 
[00:33:30]  We're keeping our jobs and adjusting our show accordingly to keep it funny and entertaining, yet not get thrown off the goddamn air.  Or thrown out the door.  What's wrong with that?  Barely keeping our job.  We just threw a 30-day suspension.  Thank you.  We almost got fired a couple of weeks ago.  Satellite radio.  It was in the paper and on the news for two weeks straight.  Did you miss it?  I mean, for God's sake, we almost got fired. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, well, you know, again, I don't know why they did what they did.  They made a story over there out of nothing.  It wouldn't have been a story until they made it a story.  Well, believe me, we've had chats about that, too, and we're talking about your email, though.  I'm just trying to explain, and I thought you, of all people, would understand what's going on in radio these days.  It's like you've given up.  It's like you're being almost petulant children by saying, well, if we can't do anything, we just won't do anything. 
[00:34:30]  Given up.  You've missed a lot of the conversations that take place on and off the air between Opie and Tom.  That is barely giving up.  Believe me.  If Opie had a gun.  That full hour you spent yesterday with that animal rights lady was entertaining.  Marge from the Little Shelter is pretty much a character on the show now, John.  It's not just an animal rights lady.  It's very unfortunate because she agrees with you.  You poke at her and she laughs.  I mean, where's the fun in that?  If I have to explain funny and why that's funny to you, but I'll give it a shot. 
[00:35:00]  She's a woman that works at an animal shelter.  Yeah, I know who she is.  Okay, well, I'm just recapping for the audience.  That's kind of what has to be done also.  She's a woman that works at the little shelter out on Long Island.  She loves animals.  She adores animals.  And the fun factor in conversing with her is the fact that we talk about brutalizing animals,  and it makes her very uncomfortable.  There is a certain cringe factor there when she's talking about trying to get Viagra for 
[00:35:30]  a female dog to help its heart problem, and we're offering her money to punch the dogs  in the face.  I found that funny.  Yeah, it would be funny if she got all excited and shocked and hung up and what have you  and had a protest, but she just says, no, we can't do that.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's lazy.  She's insane.  It's not lazy.  She's not on every day. 
[00:36:00]  Every so often we have her on, and I find her very entertaining, funny.  She's a real person.  She's not a radio character.  You know, sometimes she does very well on the show.  Sometimes it's what it is.  That's part of what the show has always been.  It's real.  Why did you want Ben Kingsley?  Why did we want Ben Kingsley?  I don't know.  Perhaps an Oscar winner.  I understand.  Perhaps as far as you think, he's not in the demo.  I don't think he's in the demo as far as what we're doing, as far as shock radio goes. 
[00:36:30]  But perhaps an Oscar winner would be an interesting guest to have on for a segment.  He's still making movies, and the latest movie that he's in does fall into the demo we're trying to reach.  There's your answer.  Nobody knows what this movie is.  There's your answer.  He's promoting it.  That's why I have these guys on the show.  His movie hits tomorrow, Friday.  Some of your listeners know what I'm saying.  All right.  Some of them do.  You know something?  I don't disagree with you.  There are probably some listeners that are like, yeah, John's right. 
[00:37:00]  You can read that memo and let them decide what they believe.  Well, okay.  Okay.  All right.  I don't care what you say about me.  You can trash me every which way.  Everything you hate about me, I don't care what you say.  I believe in free speech.  So do we.  That's why, you know, we're not keeping you off the air or keeping for you from saying what you want to say.  So you guys ought to be getting these politically correct tight asses on the air and giving them hell on earth to pay back for what they've done to this. 
[00:37:30]  Like who?  Like who?  You think maybe having Al Sharpton on the show would be a good idea?  Yeah.  And trash him.  That's probably not a good idea.  Look what happened to Imus.  That's because Imus said a stupid thing.  You could hear clever enough to get around that.  I would love to.  Let me tell you something.  I would love to debate Reverend Al, but it's one of the, it's a landmine.  It's a landmine.  The black interest groups have put a lot of pressure on radio these days, John. 
[00:38:00]  It's the way it is right now.  Maybe that'll lighten up in a while.  Lighten up.  Are you planning to talk about Juneteenth today?  Absolutely.  I was talking about it in the office.  You should have heard the racial epithets coming out of my mouth.  Can't use them on the air.  Well, no, and you shouldn't.  You didn't need to do that, and you never did.  No.  But of course Juneteenth.  We were going to talk about that, rioting, the fact that the news had to say four times 
[00:38:30]  that Juneteenth, the celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation by blacks all over the country,  the news had to mention four times that the actual Juneteenth celebration was peaceful.  It was afterwards that 1,000 or 2,000 black people were rioting in the streets,  turning over cars and pulling people out and punching them in the face.  Of course we were going to discuss that.  It's on the list.  We talk about the news, John, every day.  We riff about the news and our life. 
[00:39:00]  I've gotten into the past few weeks alone numerous occasions of bringing up stories of growing up in California  and my father and how awful the upbringing was.  Well, that's what we do on a daily basis.  Not on a daily basis.  Not often enough, Anthony.  I don't agree with you on that, John.  I really don't.  I think on a daily basis we do that.  We have fun.  We have the comics in to comment on the news.  We have people like Marge on who's just – I find Marge entertaining. 
[00:39:30]  Whether you do or not, I think that's a taste issue.  And I think, again, a little sour grapes.  I think you're looking with a very overcritical eye now because you're not really in our camp anymore, are you, John?  I am totally in your camp.  I just want to get you back.  We don't want you in our camp if you're going to write these sarcastic emails in the middle of the night, John.  You could have – no one I have no respect for, the fact that you wrote these emails instead of just giving us a call on the phone.  It's passive-aggressive, something that Jimmy completely hates. 
[00:40:00]  And that's exactly what you've been doing with these emails.  Passive-aggressive, dripping with sarcasm.  This doesn't help us.  You're trying to knock us down a few notches, and you're not going to do it.  I did.  I did do it.  You're not going to do it.  And by the way, I'm not passive-aggressive.  I'm aggressive-aggressive.  We got you.  You're not aggressive, John.  Anyone that hides behind a keyboard in the middle of the night and sends emails is not aggressive.  An aggressive person would have called our radio show and got into it, not us calling you. 
[00:40:30]  You would have called our cell phones personally.  You would have showed up on the front stoop of the radio station.  That's aggressive.  What you did is certainly not aggressive.  Listen, Greg.  Oh, okay.  Use my real name.  You knew about the change.  You wouldn't tell me.  Considering I probably wouldn't have even seen you on the last day if I didn't go into the studio.  Considering I never heard friggin' word one from you after.  Why am I going to rush to call you?  I don't need you to call me, but if you had a problem with me, then that's what people do that are aggressive. 
[00:41:00]  They don't hide behind emails.  That's the point I'm making, John.  And for you to, like, blame you not getting anything done at this station on the fact that we didn't do well with ratings is completely insane.  Because the shows you did have control with were not really tracking, were they?  What?  The shows you had complete control with were not tracking, were they?  The ones I put in were.  Look at Ron and Fez.  Look at Dick DiPaolo. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, look at the trend next week.  Yeah, okay.  I'll tell you right now, you're going to see great Ron and Fez, and you're going to see another uptick in the midday.  Yeah, Ron and Fez were doing great.  We never deny the fact that Ron and Fez were doing great.  Yeah, well, I put them on.  And we're going to have a horrible trend, John?  No, I don't know.  You guys...  We were way, way past what the station was doing.  So for you to sit there and say you're going to blame us on your firing is ridiculous. 
[00:42:00]  So way down from where they were last summer?  They're not way down from last summer.  Now you're talking about stuff that we got to sit down and decipher.  They're not way down from last summer.  They're not way down from last...  No, they're not.  They're just not.  Everybody came back, rushed back to hear you, and you didn't deliver the show they remembered.  No, that's not true, John.  Or we wouldn't be here.  I told you that a hundred times.  We wouldn't be here.  We're an expensive show. 
[00:42:30]  If that was the truth, they would have fired us.  They could save a lot of money.  You know how this works.  We're a very expensive show.  We're a very expensive show.  They would just get rid of us, save a lot of money, put a guy in here to spin tunes or what have you.  There's a reason why we're still here.  We still have a value to the company.  We would have to replace you on a whole bunch of stations.  And like me, they knew you were turning around.  We were making good progress.  This year. 
[00:43:00]  And then I just think it, starting almost with the XM thing, I thought you guys went south again.  Starting with the XM thing?  What are you talking about?  When XM suspended you.  Yeah.  I got the feeling that you guys basically said, eh, who needs it?  Forget it.  Wow.  A lot of people said that we never sounded better.  So that's opinion.  Yeah.  Well, people are going to tell you you don't sound so good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have.  They have.  Yeah.  Like who?  Who said it to your face? 
[00:43:30]  John, are you drinking right now?  Yeah.  Mountain Dew.  I heard a clinking of ice.  Mountain Dew.  Okay.  I thought maybe you were drinking.  No, I very rarely drink.  Okay.  You better be careful.  You want to get sued at.  I didn't say, I said, is he drinking?  I didn't say he's a drunk.  I said, is he drinking?  Well, if you're drinking at 630 in the morning, it's a little bit.  I've done it.  I thought maybe you could have been up all night. 
[00:44:00]  I actually am.  I mean, I have been.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, John, I wish you the best.  I'll take the high road.  I wish you the best.  I don't know what to tell you.  I did think you were the right person for the job, and I still do, but it didn't work out.  So, you know, good luck, whatever you do next.  Yeah, well, you know, I would say the same to you.  All right.  I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  I hate that phrase.  Yeah, see, if you knew the show, it's kind of a running gag on the show. 
[00:44:30]  Whenever people really aren't seeing eye to eye whatsoever, you just cop out by saying we'll have to agree to disagree.  Right.  It's like, it's a bit.  All right there, John.  Well, I think you should read the memo and let the listeners decide.  All right.  All right.  See you guys.  Bye-bye, John.  There's his memo. 
[00:45:00]  We pretty much ran through it on the air right there, talking.  He's, uh, oof, unbelievable.  This business just blows.  It just blows.  It really does.  Oof.  It just blows.  You get Tom rushing in here to prevent good radio.  It's a, let me tell you what this is.  It's a balancing act.  It's, it's a, you're spinning plates when you're doing radio. 
[00:45:30]  It's not a job that you come in, do what you want and walk out the door.  It wasn't even at any W.  If you remember at any W, we were constantly at odds, yelling, screaming, trying to get things  through.  And as we got more popular, more things were taken away because we were on the radar.  As they said, that continues to happen, uh, not only with the FCC, unfortunately, but  with interest groups, people will get you in trouble.  That's just the way it is.  And you have to ride a very narrow line between doing an entertaining show and getting fired. 
[00:46:00]  The show we used to do is the get fired show.  We're still doing it.  We almost got fired.  It starts with an F.  We almost got fired.  It's a very hard thing to do the show we do and keep your job.  That's why there's so few shows like this left.  That's why they had to call us back to this frigging company.  Do you think they wanted to hire the Opie and Anthony show?  We screwed them years ago. 
[00:46:30]  They don't like us, but they had to.  There's no other show to put on.  Howard left and there's us.  Who else are you going to get?  So we're trying to do an entertaining show, which I absolutely believe we're doing.  I love working with these two guys.  There's nothing else to do, but do the best show we can do and keep the job.  We can get fired today.  Believe me, it's easy.  Watch. 
[00:47:00]  One word and we're fired.  But it just, he doesn't seem to understand that.  There was, like I said, I'll wrap it up.  His email here with his critiques are a lot more biased than they were when he was working with us.  And all I can attribute that to is a bit of bitterness, sour grapes, whatever you want to call it.  He has personal issues.  He brought it up when he said we didn't tell him that the station was flipping formats.  There wasn't a phone call the day after the format flip, things like that. 
[00:47:30]  There's personal issues there.  That's what I was getting from the phone call.  There's a paranoia in his head.  You know, he's trying to put a lot of facts together.  Like, we weren't talking to him on a regular basis to begin with.  So then he thought I was avoiding him because I knew about a format change.  I'll tell you something else.  It's very difficult.  We weren't talking to him on a regular basis.  We had our differences with the guy.  It's very difficult also to come in here, do this show, then do the XM show, and then have a show meeting, and then meet with the program director. 
[00:48:00]  Our schedule is really screwed up by doing two shows.  When we were suspended, we were getting done here at 9.  We didn't go home at 9.  It gave us a lot of time to do meetings and things that we hadn't been able to do.  Perhaps in that situation, it would have been easier for us to meet with John and talk with him, but it was kind of a rough thing to work both shows and meet with management. 
[00:48:30]  By the way, every phone call is saying that the show's been really, really good lately.  And by the way...  If I plunk them down, then John will go, well, you know, you did that.  They're just fans.  There's also people probably that would agree with me, but you wouldn't put them on.  I'm not saying there are people that wouldn't agree with him.  Of course there are.  There are people that agree with Hitler.  I don't...  You know, there's people that agree with everything.  Great example.  I'm going from, you know, one big extreme. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know what to say.  But to say that we cost him the job.  Yeah, that was weird.  It cost him two jobs.  Say what you will about our ratings, but we're outperforming this station by leaps and bounds.  And by the way...  There's only so much we could do.  When some of the other day parts are barely doing a one-share, it makes it really tough.  Do you think we really enjoyed getting fired for two years for the St. Pat's thing?  Just to get you fired, John?  Mwahaha.  Hey, Opie, we got John fired. 
[00:49:30]  Mwahaha.  We just have to sit out for two years and rot.  Well, a lot of people calling up saying he was contradicting himself.  That is a contradiction right there because he wants us to be on the edge and rebels.  Well, yeah, we continue to do that.  We just got suspended for 30 days.  And us being rebels got us fired for two years.  And by the way, when he said his show...  But that got him fired, so he, I guess, figured maybe we shouldn't have done that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We didn't go into the studio that day going, well, this will be the thing that will cost John Minnelli his job. 
[00:50:00]  When he said his shows, like, that wasn't my show, that wasn't my show, we weren't in his show.  We were here first.  He was brought in after we were hired here.  I'm sure he'll take...  We were hired from Hollander.  I'm sure he'll take the credit for our rating success here.  Yeah, of course.  We took David Lee Roth's crappy numbers and we made something of them.  And you know what?  Let's just throw this out there. 
[00:50:30]  We'll end it with this.  A trend comes out, what, Monday, Tuesday?  I'm sure everyone's going to focus on the trend on Monday for this station here in New York.  Let's see what happens.  Okay.  Let's see what it looks like on Monday.  All right.  That's it.  Fair enough.  Because if it sucks, then they have a chance to fire us again.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  I have no idea what we're going to do now today because we're about three breaks behind.  Let's just play commercials the rest of the show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:51:00]  That was kind of cool. 
[00:51:30]  And he's one of the few guys...  I still think he's an effing lunatic.  I think he came to the phone.  There's something going on in his head, but I'll give John this much.  He still has passion for radio.  Yeah.  There's not many guys that do these days.  I don't agree with his take on it, and I think it's biased with the little personal feelings that he's got.  You know, being a little bitter with things.  But what are you going to do?  I'm only saying that when you get rich, people get soft.  It's like there are certain things that are beyond your control. 
[00:52:00]  Like when certain impressions of certain ethnicities are done, they dump out of it.  They dump out of certain impressions of ethnic voices now.  I would love to.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, Louis C.K. was doing a stereotypical Asian accent yesterday when we were talking about something with Vietnam.  It was being dumped out of.  You aren't going to hear it.  It was it's one of those things now that can't be done anymore.  I used to do the Yoshi delivery guy when we first got to N.E.W. 
[00:52:30]  And it was, you know, because we got a lot of Asian Chinese food delivery guys that ride their bicycles like maniacs in between traffic.  And it was kind of a fun bit to do.  You know, it was like a fake phone call kind of a thing we would do.  And it was fun.  You know, people seem to enjoy it.  Can't do that now.  Would love to do things like that.  Can't do it.  Mike Tyson.  Grab a Tyson bit from N.E.W. from the old days and play it on this station.  And let's see how far it gets before it gets dumped out of.  It was nothing but him sexually assaulting women and them coming back at him with some kind of racist response. 
[00:53:00]  All done in humor and funny.  And it should absolutely be able to be played.  But because of the environment we're in, you don't.  It can't.  That's just the world we live in.  If John wants us again, like I said, to throw ourselves on a sword for our art, so be it.  I don't think I'm ready to do that right now.  I think we're talented enough to work within the guidelines. 
[00:53:30]  And until we say to ourselves, you know something?  It's gotten much too restrictive.  We can't do a show.  Then we're done.  Because then we won't be able to do a show.  And we'll be fired anyway.  He's really trying to downplay the success we've had, too, since coming back to regular radio.  So the last trend we did a 2.6 in mornings, that was from 6 to 10.  We were sharing an hour with JV and Elvis.  I know it's part of my brain.  We were sharing an hour with JV and Elvis, and they were on suspension. 
[00:54:00]  So their show, that time slot was a complete disaster.  They said that we did over a 3.0 if you take out the JV and Elvis hour.  The station itself overall, including our 3 share, did a 1.3 to 1.4.  And a lot of that was due to Ron and Fez's success.  Yeah, they had had great numbers.  So for him to downplay and say that we cost him a job because we weren't performing as well as we should have, 
[00:54:30]  we were outperforming the station by leaps and bounds and continue to.  We'll see you on Monday.  I'm brave enough to say that I do believe we're going to have a really good trend on Monday.  Not knocking wood.  Sure, why not?  Sure hope.  I don't want to look stupid.  Sure.  I don't want to look stupid now.  Can I ask an off-the-subject question?  Yeah, please.  Which I certainly wanted to talk about.  Yeah.  When did that happen?  On Juneteenth.  Which is what? 
[00:55:00]  It's Juneteenth.  I don't know exactly what.  Is this the first time you've ever heard of Juneteenth?  Of course it is.  This is the first time I've heard of it.  I've heard of it as a girl's name.  I've never heard of Juneteenth, but apparently it was when news got to – what?  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  It's when news of the Emancipation Proclamation got to slaves and they were free.  And it's been being celebrated. 
[00:55:30]  And I heard actually on an ad for one of the black newspapers, The Guardian, here in New York City, that it's a time –  But you don't read newspapers?  No.  I certainly don't.  No.  It's a time to celebrate diversity and cooperation within the black race and all these kinds of things.  And then you see what was going on in a few cities yesterday.  Just destruction.  Crowds in the thousands. 
[00:56:00]  I saw a helicopter cam, which at least had maybe 500 people walking down the street, destroying cars, pulling people out of their cars, and beating them about the head.  Same stuff that happens at the St. Pat's Parade.  Oh.  Oh, that's right.  It doesn't.  Oh, same stuff that happens at the Columbus Day Parade.  No, but Columbus was just a murderer.  So, you know, the whole concept of the Columbus Day Parade is bad. 
[00:56:30]  But that's one of those things like – and here's what really got me this morning.  We're watching the coverage of that on the news this morning in the office.  And the news four times during this story had to say that during the actual celebration, which there were thousands of police at, by the way, that it was peaceful.  They had to say it four times.  This was peaceful during the celebration itself.  Peaceful during the celebration. 
[00:57:00]  But then once they got out of that celebration atmosphere where that was, you know, pretty much every square foot had a cop, it was just what we used to be referred to as wilding.  Yeah.  Just breaking cars, stomping, jumping on people's cars until they get out and then punching the hell out of them.  When one guy actually was killed, they – somebody hit a child with a car, non-life-threatening injuries to the child. 
[00:57:30]  They dragged the driver out and the passenger got out to help.  Somehow the driver got back into his car, but the passenger was beaten to death by what they assumed was about 20 men with their bare hands.  And there's no racial other tones at any of the beatings.  It was a – it was a Hispanic man that they beat to death.  And it was all black men that beat him to death.  Wow.  But that wasn't reported on – it wasn't even reported as a Juneteenth event on the news.  They just reported it as an assault to a man who was dragged out of his car and killed. 
[00:58:00]  So that's like – that's the kind of stuff that just annoys the crap out of me when the news can't be honest about things that are going on in any community, black, Asian.  You know, you can't – you can't – you can't address these things without this fear, this cloud of fear over your head that it's going to cost you your job, your livelihood, your reputation or whatever.  When is Reverend Al speaking out?  Is it later today?  You will not hear a peep out of Reverend Al about Juneteenth and the violence that happened. 
[00:58:30]  I thought I saw something that he might be doing at a press conference or –  Did a white radio host say something bad?  Because I don't think you'll see him pop out.  I'm sure it will be something about how the police influenced it.  It will somehow blame the cops.  It will somehow blame people or it will somehow exonerate a group of people who are running through the streets behaving like barbarians.  I'm sorry.  If you're yanking people out of cars and you're beating them and you're supposed to be at a celebration, you are a barbarian. 
[00:59:00]  A celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Exactly.  It's a fun thing to say.  It rhymes.  Right.  Celebration Proclamation.  And this helicopter view, I swear to you, is frightening to watch.  I'm sure it's on YouTube or Break or one of the other video sites.  I know I saw it on Drudge yesterday.  You just look at this.  There's no sound.  It's just a helicopter view.  It goes on for about four minutes.  And you just see crowds of people walking down the streets in what I could only assume would be a nightmare for anybody caught up in that. 
[00:59:30]  A nightmare.  All young black men just destroying things.  Kind of like what happened at Madison Square Garden during that high school basketball game.  And kind of like other – what was the other one recently that there was another – just a horrible behavior in public.  It wasn't just – it was something else that happened.  Yeah.  But you're not allowed to mention that. 
[01:00:00]  But the news doesn't focus on that.  That's a problem.  That is a huge problem right there.  There's an issue that goes deeper than just a big crowd wrecking things.  Well, this footage, it does say post-Juneteenth violence.  Post-Juneteenth.  Well, they were there for Juneteenth.  And shouldn't they still be caught up in that whole celebratory moment?  You watch.  You watch.  That was St. Paddy's Day.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:30]  But you watch.  They would say, and accurately so, Irish people rioted all over the place.  They would mention that.  Right.  Irish people.  You would hear that.  Right.  They say nothing about the ethnicity of the people, the hundreds, thousands of people  that are just wreaking havoc.  Here's a woman being taken down by one of the police horses.  Wow.  This was in Milwaukee.  That had a hurt.  In Milwaukee?  Yeah.  Milwaukee.  And then there were celebrations in multiple cities. 
[01:01:00]  I got to say, I only heard probably two or three cities where there was a problem.  So, apparently, other cities went off without a hitch.  That's fine.  But there's an issue here that should be addressed that people are afraid to address.  Yeah.  Because, like I said, your job, your reputation, whatever, is going to be tossed out the window  because you'll be taken out of context or it'll be interpreted as being racist if you  just give up play-by-play of what's happening.  Look, here's the reality.  If there was groups of white people dragging people out of cars and beating them and one 
[01:01:30]  was beaten to death and a Spanish man was beaten to death, it would be a lot bigger  deal.  It's out of the papers already.  If it's in the paper, here we got Bloomberg and Giuliani.  No, it's really not in the papers today.  It's not?  But I didn't really read the papers today.  No, you don't.  But the pictures are nice.  I can barely lift them at this point.  Why bother?  Why bother?  Why bother?  The only stacks of paper I want to hold is my money.  That's right.  Preferably in hundreds.  Oh, praise the good point. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, praise the good point.  He said if they fired this show, they could save a lot of money.  And I'm like, well, wait a minute.  If they kept Jim Norton here alone for just the Norton show, they'd save a bundle.  Oh, boy, would they.  We got to take a break.  We got to catch up a little bit.  Let's catch up.  Is that all right, John?  Can we take a break?  We still got to play commercials.  Cater to the man.  Go ahead.  Cater to the man and take a break.  If you were a rebel, you'd stay on until 730.  We'll cater to Tom today instead of John. 
[01:02:30]  Is that all right, John?  Is that okay?  Is it okay?  Open Anthony.  Go.  If you have something for the show, give us a call at 877-212-5762.  Let's go to Boston.  Say hi to Brendan.  He's listening on BCN.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Brendan.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, I just, I'm flipping, driving to work this morning, you know, lovely traffic  here in Boston, and I'm listening, and I haven't heard anything about this. 
[01:03:00]  This has grabbed zero traction in the media here in Boston.  What are you talking about?  John Minnelli's memo or...  It wouldn't be in the paper.  Oh, oh, oh, what?  The rioting.  Oh, the Juneteenth.  Juneteenth.  I didn't even know there was a Juneteenth.  I never heard of Juneteenth.  And apparently it's been around for quite some time.  No clue.  But I never heard of Juneteenth.  The funny thing is, dude, and I've been screaming about this.  By the way, when I said before, like, why is it when black people get together a lot of 
[01:03:30]  times, I'm sorry.  That's the reality.  We mentioned this, and then I said The Garden.  The other one I was trying to grab was Source Awards.  At the Source Awards, there's always violence.  Why?  Why does that happen?  I don't get why that happens.  And it's out of the paper in two days.  A guy was beaten to death.  Right.  And dragged out of the car.  It's gone.  You know what's on the front page of the paper?  Stupid Giuliani and questionable sexual preferences voiced Bloomberg.  Only the voice.  He's a straight guy. 
[01:04:00]  If you heard him on the phone, you'd go, wow, where is she from?  Not a masculine voice.  But I mean, where is it?  It's out of the paper.  Yeah, it should be huge front page news.  If white people were rioting, justifiably, it would be on the front page.  Well, you know, one white guy says something inappropriate, and the media covers it obsessively  for two weeks.  Yeah, I don't understand how a group of people can drag someone, a group of hundreds of people  can drag people out of their cars and beat one to death.  And it's not a giant story. 
[01:04:30]  There isn't.  It's barely a flip.  It's not front page like, oh my God, wait a minute, you mean to tell me there's a group  of people that dragged someone out of their car and beat them to death and destroyed property?  Why isn't that big news?  Why aren't they covering it?  Because they're afraid.  They're afraid.  Sharpton's going to give some awful thing about how we as a community.  Yeah.  What?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Sharpton should be dragged out of a car and raped and beaten himself.  But I mean. 
[01:05:00]  Well, there you go.  Your opinion, sir.  Let's make it perfectly clear that Brendan is insane.  He's crazy, and we would never condone any action like that.  It would be a hell of a funny video.  To see anyone trying to assault Sharpton sexually, good luck.  God Almighty, if you can function under those circumstances, with that hairdo and that awful  voice, you're a stronger man than me, which is not saying much.  My erections are tentative.  Tentative?  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  That's crazy.  I'd like to hear him talk about that, but there's definitely a problem there that needs  to be addressed by leaders like Sharpton.  I use the word leader in laugh.  The guy's not a leader.  But they need a true leader, and I'm not even talking about an Obama-type leader who  is a little too – he's concentrating a little too much on mass appeal, knowing that  he needs a liberal white vote also.  He can't just concentrate on the black vote.  So he's not coming across as a strong leader that needs to address issues in this black 
[01:06:00]  community that Reverend Al is always addressing, that there are problems with black-on-black  violence like that.  Black-on-hispanic violence is up.  Like I said, I read a lot of papers.  I read the crime stats a lot, believe me.  I know percentages of black-on-white crime, white-on-black crime, which is a very low percentage. 
[01:06:30]  And it doesn't make sense.  There's a problem there that needs to be addressed, but these leaders aren't addressing that.  They'd rather do these sensational things like the Imus things and get the news that  way.  And it's amazing what the media finds important and what story they're willing to run with.  Yeah.  They go for the safe stuff is what it comes down to.  I mean, something like this, that's some serious heavy lifting.  A white guy making a naughty remark. 
[01:07:00]  White people love to scold each other over racism.  Yeah.  Because it's almost like, you know, again, it's an adult scolding an adult.  Yeah.  Because white people scold you over your racism.  Oh, that was terrible.  Can I jump in?  Speaking of the white racist thing, I'm watching Rescue Me.  I'm catching up.  Okay.  I got the box set.  So I'm doing the box set.  Marathon.  Nice.  I can't even be bothered waiting a week in between episodes anymore.  And they had to go into sensitivity training because one of the fire dudes, can we say the  T word for the girl's thing?  No. 
[01:07:30]  We can't.  Is that good enough, what I just said?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So they can figure it out there.  So one of the firemen said that.  Mm-hmm.  Called a girl that.  Right.  So they had to do sensitivity training.  And they're sitting there and they're watching the video, the sensitivity training video,  and they're just getting annoyed, Dennis Leary especially.  And they show like a white business guy going up to a black business guy.  And all the white guy said was, hey, did you see the game last night?  And that is, I guess, racist because you're assuming that all black people are athletic. 
[01:08:00]  Athletic and into sports.  And they would be the ones that would see the big game last night.  And the black guy in the video was insulted that the white guy said this to him.  And I'm like, are you kidding me?  What's this, black nerds for more recognition?  We don't watch sports.  And then there's more examples of that where it's white saying things to black guys and  girls that were really, in my world, not inappropriate whatsoever.  And you can see Dennis Leary especially getting more and more pissed in the room.  I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen the scene. 
[01:08:30]  And then they stopped the tape, the video.  And the guy goes, anyone have any questions?  And Dennis Leary stands up and goes, or what have you guys learned?  And Dennis Leary stands up and goes, I learned that only white people can be racist.  And then he went on a tirade that's just classic.  What about the blacks making fun of the Puerto Ricans?  The blacks making fun of the Asians?  The Asians making fun of the Cubans?  Whatever.  He just had all these scenarios.  And then he walked out like, this is completely ridiculous. 
[01:09:00]  Can I say how beautiful, too, that D.L.  Hughley is, I love D.L.  Hughley because he was completely on the same thing with the Imus situation.  D.L.  is one of those guys, the comic says what he wants to say.  He got protested recently.  I think it was in Dallas.  We were just talking about this off the air.  Because he said the Imus remarks and they're trying to make it look like, well, what's good  for the goose is good for the gander.  So black people down there protested him and they wanted an apology.  And I just love it.  He said, no.  Good.  Good for him.  Go worry about teaching a kid to read or stopping a war.  I will not apologize for making jokes about life as I see it. 
[01:09:30]  Good for him.  Perfect.  Jokes about life the way he sees it.  What's wrong with that?  Exactly.  Do you honestly believe that those, the people at the Juneteenth, leaving, leaving the Juneteenth  celebration.  Because it was peaceful.  That was peaceful.  Of course.  That was peaceful.  But afterwards, when there weren't cops around, it was people getting dragged out of their  cars and beaten and killed.  Do you think, when people are watching that on television, that they are judging those 
[01:10:00]  people by the content of their character or the color of their skin?  Or the quality of the video.  Yeah.  Do you honestly think?  Because that always strikes me.  The words of Martin Luther King when he said, you know, judging people by the content of  their character and not by the color of their skin.  People are being judged by the content of their character.  And if their character stinks, that's the way they're going to be judged. 
[01:10:30]  When people are rioting and dragging people out of their vehicles and beating them to death,  I don't think it's so much people saying, you know, what color are they?  I think it's the fact that it's a group of people dragging people out of their cars and  killing them.  Can somebody point out, like, you talk about ethnicity and race and stuff, like, people  always want to say, like, ethnic pride we've talked about.  It's like people want to celebrate racial accomplishments.  Right.  Like, you know, black people, Italians, everybody gets together and celebrates the accomplishments 
[01:11:00]  of other people in that group, and that's acceptable.  Like, the Irish parades are about the Irish, and God bless the Irish.  The Puerto Rican Day Parade.  Puerto Ricans are very proud.  They love to fly the flag.  We're Puerto Rican.  And, you know, they make sure you know it by the music being played loud enough so you  can hear it four blocks away.  Right.  Oh, they love souping up their Corollas, too, man.  Let's not forget.  Yes, they write their name on the side of the script.  They know what to do with those cars.  And stop dressing your four-year-olds up like hookers.  Jesus Christ.  They get their ears pierced out of the womb.  But they are very, look, they are proud of being Puerto Rican, and they let you know it, 
[01:11:30]  and that's fine.  Right.  But yet, if you mention something negative about a group, how is that, like, racist?  Like, to say all black people are great at doing this is wonderful.  Like, boy, black accomplishments and your list, and people are great.  Lump us into that category.  But there's no bad thing that also goes hand-in-hand with a certain race group.  Like, there's only good.  If you can celebrate the good, then just as you can't appreciate the good without the evil.  That sounds way too logical. 
[01:12:00]  It does make perfect sense, Jimmy, that if you can celebrate your accomplishments and your good,  that there has to be, on the other hand, evil and badness that only goes along with a certain group for the most part.  I'm not saying everything.  Black History Month is a celebration of black accomplishments, black achievements, which for a long time they were denied.  So it's almost like bringing things to light that were shut out for so many years.  Right.  Fine.  So if all those things can be attributed color-wise, why can't you attribute a negative color-wise? 
[01:12:30]  Why is that so?  Yeah.  White people just suck.  White people just suck.  Well, white people, we could do it.  We could say, you know, the accomplishments white people have made, Europeans have made in invention, things like that, innovation in machinery.  Germans are so good at machining and building things.  Yeah, could you stop using that example?  I just have to say that.  But then, on the other hand...  How about some nicer people that didn't, like, use machinery to march everybody to death?  How about people that cured something?  Yeah, there you go.  Anthony takes lemons and he makes... 
[01:13:00]  Anthony takes genocide and makes lemonade.  Thanks, dude.  Why did I have to bring up Germany?  You've got to do, you've got to do.  I definitely appreciate the fact that the Germans are very good engineers.  They're very good at engineering and machinery and they're very innovative in that.  But Europeans, I'm saying, white Europeans, then came to this country and on one hand, they're very good, very resourceful,  building great ships to bring themselves to this country where we worked our way westward and killed every single thing we met on the way. 
[01:13:30]  Like, that's the bad part.  We decided, hey, we come to America, we're going to move west and just hang guns out of our wagons and trains eventually and just shoot everything in the way.  I'm willing to accept that as a white person, that that was done and that was a pretty evil thing, along with the accomplishments of white Europeans. 
[01:14:00]  But why can't anything be pointed out in any race that isn't good, that is attributed to maybe just that race?  Again, I say for the most part because there's going to be exceptions everywhere.  But you just can't do it anymore.  You really can't.  This should get the coverage that I just got, but it's already gone.  Because white people run the media and white people, and black people know this, do not, especially like elitist media,  they don't see black people as equal so they'll never scold black people the way they scold each other. 
[01:14:30]  Because adults always scold each other differently than they scold children.  Liberal whites, you're right.  They treat black people like children.  Like it's expected of them, so they don't want to punish them as badly.  Because that riot footage reminds people of stuff in the civil rights era where black people were justifiably rioting against brutality.  Right.  And this is not justifiable rioting.  This is just barbaric. 
[01:15:00]  Barbarism.  Barbarism.  On the street.  I should learn to say that word before I try to use it.  Barbarino.  We still got to catch up a little bit.  Yes, we do.  Because of that crazy first hour we had.  Got to pay the bills, John.  Ha, ha, ha.  And by the way, John, don't pat yourself on the back.  We were going to talk about this today.  I know he's sitting there going, oh, it had an effect today.  Did you?  John's running the show from his house now.  All right, whatever.  It's open, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:15:30]  Well, Matt, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Floyd in Vegas.  Floyd.  What's up, Floyd?  Floyd?  Hey there, Floyd.  Did we lose Floyd?  Floyd.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Floyd. 
[01:16:00]  What's up, man?  I think John Minnelli's a douche, and the show has been as funny as ever in the last  week, so we can go screw.  Thank you, Floyd.  You sound a little tired.  You're breathing in that burning tire smoke over there in Vegas.  Can you see it?  Just tired.  Wait, what's going on in Vegas with the tires?  There's a huge pile of tires.  Yeah.  From one of the big races out there?  Yeah.  And they're burning, and a bunch of black smoke is just wafting into the air from burning  rubber tires.  Wow, there's problems with one of the races out there. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I'm out drinking all night.  Oh, you're out drinking all night, so you don't care about the burning tires.  You missed a doozy by, uh...  Oh, damn it.  I heard it.  I was talking to Floyd.  Floyd sounds a little slow today.  All right, Floyd.  You're in Vegas.  Thank you, sir.  All right, thank you, sir.  It was a mess.  Now we'll go to Detroit.  Chris, what's going on, buddy?  What's up over there?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, I just read this story in a paper.  I don't know if you read the paper, Opie, but, uh...  Nice callback.  Those weird little shots he took during that argument, I don't know what to tell you. 
[01:17:00]  I read so many papers, I can't even...  At least five a day.  At least.  And not counting the ones I take a peek at online.  And that doesn't include the advocate, which he gets sent to his home.  Yeah, well, this one...  Love the classifieds.  Just trying to keep informed.  What, Chris?  Uh, Columbia, South Carolina, they found two naked people that had fallen from 50 feet  from the roof of an office building.  I got it, sir. 
[01:17:30]  And they were naked.  Naked people?  And they were naked and stuff.  I assume they were probably having sex, right?  I would assume on the roof.  Maybe they found the clothes on the roof.  Some cab driver found them on the road.  Wait, they're both dead?  Yeah, we got the story here.  They were dead.  It's one of the better stories today.  All right, Chris.  Watch it out, guys.  Yeah, we'll take it from here.  Thanks for the setup.  Dead and totally nude.  Yeah, totally nude.  What a way to go.  Can you imagine falling 50 feet naked?  God's kingdom of nakedness. 
[01:18:00]  50 to 60 feet, oh my gosh, sloping metal roof.  Yeah, I got it right here, Jimmy.  Here it is.  Oh, God.  Here it is.  What a nightmare.  Columbia police are investigating the deaths of a young couple who they say accidentally  fell off a roof early this morning.  Now, police are telling us that a cab driver found the two injured lying on Laurel Street  without any clothes on.  That's where it ends?  Jeez, it's insensitive.  Just to get us going there.  That's the news anchor.  Explain the situation. 
[01:18:30]  I wonder if the guy lost his f*** on.  Do you think he still had it?  I think that they were just going at it and they didn't realize how sloped the roof was  or something like that.  Why would you be on a sloped roof having sex?  I can understand a flat roof, you know?  It's kind of cool.  You're outside.  A little exciting.  But if you're on a steep friggin' Howard Johnson's roof, you're done.  You're on a church steeple. 
[01:19:00]  Well, we got the homeless woman.  She will explain here what happened.  All righty.  You know I'm homeless.  This Lincoln Street parking garage is a place where Naomi Mosley occasionally seeks shelter.  And I was getting up, packing up my stuff to get it out and get it out of the place.  It's also the place where she and her husband witnessed a young couple arrive in a car, then  climb onto the roof of the building next door.  When they came in, they was laughing.  You know what I mean?  Like laughing and happy and saying, hey, there's some people climbing up. 
[01:19:30]  A final act.  Her arm was up in the air and he was pulling her up.  He said, baby, you know what I mean?  I got you.  Before falling to their deaths.  Wake up, whoopie.  That was not whoopie.  It sounds like it was.  Was that one of her characters from her one-woman show?  They were clowning up?  Is that what she said?  Oh, climbing up.  Okay.  I thought there was some slang I missed.  She said clowning up?  No, they were climbing up. 
[01:20:00]  Climbing up.  So what?  They wanted to have a little sex.  Yeah.  Decided they were going to do it on the roof and something went horribly wrong.  They fell.  They said, don't worry, baby, I got you.  Yeah.  And then they fell?  Yeah.  Were they having sex or were they naked climbing up?  Hope they didn't slip in the alley.  What a way to go.  Oh, God.  Maybe that's it.  Is that on your foot?  Whoops.  No, they found the clothes on the roof.  Yeah.  So they were naked.  Well, the homeless woman, a.k.a. Whoopie, continues her explanation, right?  Naomi says she and her husband decided to just mind their own business. 
[01:20:30]  When they came downstairs around 530, she saw the taxi cab driver who found the bodies and stopped to call 911.  Soon after, police had blocked off the streets.  Lord God, I hope they gave the soul to you.  Police found the couple's clothing on the garage roof, but they did not find any evidence of foul play.  It was purely accidental.  Naomi says it's a sight she wishes she'd never seen.  I feel heartache that it happened, because I wouldn't want my worst enemy to fall off my roof like that. 
[01:21:00]  Wake up, Whoopie.  Um, I wouldn't want my worst enemy to fall off the roof.  Yes.  Can I tell them if I never break?  My worst enemy, I'd want more than, I consider my worst enemy Osama bin Laden.  Yeah.  And I'd want worse for him than just falling off a roof.  There are things we say that just don't make sense.  I want horrific things to happen to my worst enemy. 
[01:21:30]  To my worst enemy.  I have no problem admitting that.  Yes, horrid things.  When people say, oh, I wouldn't even wish that on my worst enemy.  Really?  I think you would.  Oh, man, I would.  I wouldn't, because it's not harsh enough.  Yeah.  The roof doesn't do it.  No.  How about I run more over the crotch?  That I'd wish.  Yes.  You know what I'd wish on my worst enemy?  To have to talk to that stupid Naomi.  What a dope cheat system.  God Almighty, could you have found a worst spokesperson?  And who's her worst enemy?  Anyone with a roof over their head?  Shut up. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, apparently she doesn't like roofs very much.  Oh, that's horrible.  I wouldn't wish that a roof on my worst enemy.  There's many things she doesn't like.  Yeah.  Why don't you take that and run with it at home?  Because wake up with Whoopi.  Yeah, I mean.  Damn.  I wish horrific things on my worst enemies.  Well, that lovely couple, what are you going to say?  Good luck, bros.  Good luck, bro. 
[01:22:30]  That is a crazy story.  That's great.  I hope that they had sex already, though.  I hope they weren't just for marriage.  Like finished up?  Yeah.  Probably not.  You're caught in the throes of passion.  They were probably right in the middle of it.  That's what I would think, right in the middle.  Oh, my God, you fall down like that, and you know you're about to die, so you hold on  real tight, because you're like, I don't know if I'm going to go.  Fine, I'm going to finish.  Like two dogs in the street with water thrown on you.  All right.  Why don't we give out some tickets here?  I would like that. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  It's very funny, because someone on the Instant Feedback, he writes, and we were just talking  about this during the commercials.  Update.  I can't find it.  Something about, what, no Bruce Willis this week on your show?  Yeah, no Bruce Willis.  No.  We were hoping.  He can't get up early to talk to us, even though we're pushing the hell out of his new  movie.  This is our world.  We're not even invited to the party. 
[01:23:30]  Well, we thought we were, weren't we?  Yeah, we're not.  We were supposed to be.  Yeah, there's like a big Bruce Willis thing.  We're supposed to go to the big premiere, the big premiere, and then go to a party afterwards.  Yeah.  But we don't get to go to the party.  Because we're just radio douches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we fall into the radio douches category.  I disagree.  I wish we'd reached the point of, you know, selling out, where I could go to a big Hollywood 
[01:24:00]  premiere party.  Not there yet.  You know who we get invited to?  The Ron and Fez wedding.  Right.  I'm invited to that debacle.  Casey and Dave.  And I had to hint around for Casey to invite me.  Our friends Ron and Fez have a guy, Dave, on their show, and Casey, who I tried to sleep  with unsuccessfully at one point.  And I stuck out horribly.  Did you really?  Yeah, she's very hot, and she wanted nothing to do with me sexually, as she shouldn't have.  And they're getting married today in the Hard Rock. 
[01:24:30]  And I probably will go if I'm a wide awake.  And I wasn't invited.  I had to kind of hint around talking to someone.  How would you not be invited?  It was an oversight.  I'm a small man.  I want to go.  I don't know if I'm going to make it.  Oh, I'm there.  I'm definitely going.  I got to see this.  So if I'm not there, Casey and this guy, Eastside Dave, that I don't really know, don't  take it personally.  I really want to go, but I've been sick all week and moving into a new joint.  So I'm going to try to make it, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm going to try to do the right thing.  But if I don't make it, it's nothing personal. 
[01:25:00]  Trust me.  I really will try to get there.  Just say this.  You'll be in your new mansion running into the second, third, or fourth bedroom, whatever  you feel like doing.  That's what all it does.  Oh, I didn't bring a checkbook or anything to it.  How much did I give the lovely couple?  Fifty bucks.  Nothing.  Should I give them nothing?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't we give away a pair of tickets to the premiere of Live Free or Die Hard?  It's happening tomorrow at Radio City Music Hall.  Bruce Willis is back.  It's John McClane. 
[01:25:30]  The only way to live free is to die hard in theaters June 27th.  We got a pair of tickets to the premiere tomorrow night.  Nice.  And still no Bruce Willis for our radio show.  We're good enough to do that, but not good enough to actually talk to the star of the  movie.  It's very hurtful.  It's amazing.  It's just amazing.  This business stinks.  It does hurt a little.  Oh, the tell-all book is going to be a doozy.  It's going to be a doozy.  Oh, boy, am I.  I'm lying in my tell-all book.  It's about how I got the gig and I walked in and Ope's trousers were down. 
[01:26:00]  That never happened.  It'll make for a great read.  Is that Casey over at Happy Typing Girls' house?  Is that the big bride before the wedding kind of thing that they're doing?  Yeah, the broads hang out and get her ready for the big day.  Something borrowed, something bloomed.  I guess we don't have to give out the number, but just in case, 877-212-5762.  The phones are lit.  Make sure you can go to this thing in New York tomorrow.  All right?  All right.  It's Ope and Anthony.  Yep.  Hi. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, no.  Now I'm on.  Here, Jimmy.  I was welcoming us back with no microphone.  Ha, ha.  A little irony.  That's silly.  I'm looking at flight benefits on PalTalk, and she's lotioning up her legs.  Yep.  And I'd really like to have sex with her.  Ooh.  I don't see that happening.  Whoa.  Look at the position she's taking up. 
[01:27:00]  Lovely.  Now she's lifting one leg up on the back of something and lotioning off.  Inner thighs being lotioned.  I'm hoping so are mine.  Are those real, by the way?  Yeah.  They look real.  Very good.  I'm needing her self-esteem to take a nose dive.  Oh, someone's saying, oh, they're not?  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Oh, no.  Lovely.  Yeah, it's Ope and Anthony.  877-212-5762.  Still getting emails, by the way. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Came in to do our show today, and the old PD at this joint tried to give us a good, I  don't know, trashing through an email.  I give him credit, and then he came on the phone with us, at least.  Finally.  But he's still emailing, a little bitter.  I guess he assumes we've lost him a couple of jobs.  Hey, join the club.  Go on the yacht with Ken Stevens. 
[01:28:00]  Let's see, another email coming in from John Minnelli.  Yeah, we believe in freedom of speech, too.  You can read it if you want.  So we're allowed to read this, Tom, so relax.  I've got problems all over the ball field today.  It's unbelievable.  Don't know where to look anymore.  Don't know who to trust anymore.  Don't know who is actually in our corner trying to help us do a better radio show that  don't have personal interest involved. 
[01:28:30]  I'm in your corner.  Yeah.  I'm just saying the fact that I'm doing some man-car stuff this week.  So John continues, if you guys had performed at 100% rather than 25%.  Not even giving us 50?  25%.  25%.  Because that would hurt a little bit more, right?  How can you say that?  My nickname is 110% Jimmy.  I know.  They call me.  And I'm all about 102%.  A little callback. 
[01:29:00]  Don't feel like explaining it.  But if you're just tuning in, John used to be the PD here in New York City when it was  a talk format.  And in all fairness to John, he wanted to make some changes.  The company couldn't make some of the changes just because of contracts and such.  Yeah, things in place, right?  And we were outperforming the station big time and the company decided that they needed  to change formats and go back to K-Rock here in New York and play rock.  And they decided that we were doing well enough that they said, yeah, you guys continue doing 
[01:29:30]  mornings for us.  We're very happy to have you guys do mornings for us here in New York City.  They could have got rid of us easily, especially if we were at 25%, Anthony.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Free FM could have survived the Imus thing, the JV and Elvis thing, and the XM thing.  Really?  Yes, that's something no one wants to really acknowledge.  But we compete against ourselves every morning.  It's a touchy thing to bring up.  But we actually compete against Opie and Anthony on XM. 
[01:30:00]  They're this really strong show on XM.  Yeah, we love them.  And we have to compete against them as well when we do regular radio.  Are they giving, what percent are they giving on XM?  On XM, the Opie and Anthony XM show is up to about 90%, 95%.  Wow.  And we're only at 25%.  How can we compete?  And that's why we're losing, because this Opie and Anthony, we're only giving 25%.  The other Opie and Anthony, they do rule, man, are giving 95%.  It is pretty strange, but we do compete against a show called Opie and Anthony on XM. 
[01:30:30]  Yep.  It's one of our dilemmas that we have to deal with, you know, because we made this very  unique deal with radio.  Number two, that's why I figure you cost me two gigs.  That's why I'm pissed.  Cost them two gigs?  Take some friggin' responsibility for yourself.  Stop it.  And take some, just take radio for what it is.  They've flipped formats.  You got the boot.  It happens.  And it's funny, because he's trying to say that I knew way beforehand.  And one of my pals in the business, Mike, that runs FMQB.com, he's like, John's insane. 
[01:31:00]  Like, I even knew that the station was flipping three weeks before it did.  Yeah, I know.  Everyone knew.  Stop.  It was the worst kept secret in radio.  None of the business knew.  That's why I wasn't going to, like, go for that little bit of bait that he was dangling.  Everybody knew.  The shows knew that something was amiss.  That's why I figure you cost me two gigs.  That's why I'm pissed.  And this shows that he's just insane, because, in my humble opinion, we were outperforming 
[01:31:30]  the radio station.  And if the other shows did half of what we were doing, then I...  Twelve and a half percent?  I believe that this would still be a...  Thank you, Jimmy.  A percent joke.  I'm on a rant, that's why.  It wasn't going on.  That's why I believe that it would still be a talk format here in New York.  Don't blame us.  Blame the shows that you actually had control of.  And don't bring Ron and Fez into it like they were your big discovery. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  It's like a no-brainer.  The worst PD in America would have hired Ron and Fez.  Don't make it sound like you found this hidden talent somewhere.  They were huge in New York.  Yeah.  And they could have been on a hip-hop station they would have killed in the ratings.  Everyone was excited to have those guys back here in New York.  I don't know if Fez would be as well-received at a hip-hop station.  Oh, good point.  Maybe not.  He would have to keep us.  Hey.  He would have to keep a few things on the QT.  Talk about the worst-kept secret. 
[01:32:30]  I think the format flip is us.  Second behind Fez going, ah, yeah.  Well, all right.  There you go.  He makes Paul Lynn look like Chuck Connors.  Number three.  It's 1965 reference guy.  I picked a dead guy and a guy who should have been dead 20 years ago.  I am an ass.  And that's why the show's not as good.  It certainly isn't.  If you were given 100%, you would have updated your reference.  I would have grabbed somebody from Queer Eye for the straight guy, which would have been topical,  and another tough guy. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Number three.  I didn't write such harsh memos when I was the PD because you weren't quite that bad then.  Well, we got bad.  But even then, I was pretty direct.  Now your show is virtually unlistenable.  The industry knows it.  Ah, see.  The listeners know it.  Virtually.  That's right.  As long as we're virtually unlistenable, that means we're still kind of listenable.  That means we still have a chance, right?  Taking that as a compliment.  This is what's so weird.  People that I do trust and I do get feedback from, and I wasn't going to go for that bait either. 
[01:33:30]  There are people that will tell me personally, ah, you guys got to step it up.  You've been this.  You've been that.  Maybe you're doing too much of this particular bit.  I actually have in my life an inner circle of people that I do trust, and the one thing that has been coming out is that we have a new energy since the station here in New York went back to music.  They said it's a new energy.  You sound excited.  The show sounds excited.  They sound like they just got a lot of energy, and the show has sounded much better since the flip. 
[01:34:00]  So it's his opinion against other people's opinions.  And there was a time I did respect John Minnelli's opinions as well.  But I think there's just a personal agenda here that makes it really tough to see where his real opinion lies.  There's too much personal feeling.  And it's weird.  If the show was unlistenable and the listeners know it, then were they faking the standing ovation?  And this is stuff we kind of downplay.  But were the listeners faking the standing ovation we got at Jones Beach this past Saturday night? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  There were close to 10,000 people there.  We walked on stage, and the 10,000 people gave us a standing ovation.  So if they're hating us so much, why would they go to one of our events?  That was all of our listeners.  Now, believe it, you know, and let's keep it fair here.  It's mostly an event for our comedian friends.  You know, but we put the whole thing on.  We were in the parking lot getting nothing but love from our listeners.  If it's unlistenable, why would they even show up?  No, but I got to say, it's not just an event for the comedians. 
[01:35:00]  The comedians are a great part of it, but part of it is to come out and hang with the show.  Oh, Jim.  No, no, but I'm being honest.  That's not even mock humility.  It's the truth.  Part of it is just to come out and hang with the show.  Yeah.  That's what they want to see.  They don't want to just see a bunch of comics.  They want to see comedians from the show.  Well, we've always been honest here.  I mean, you guys are doing the heavy lifting at these comedy shows.  You know, we're doing our thing, and it's well-received, but it is what it is.  But the audience is made up of our hardcore listeners just giving us a standing ovation. 
[01:35:30]  Number four, why?  Why is it unlistenable?  Anthony now phones it in, and Opie no longer execs.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Opie?  Are you there?  Yeah, what's up?  It's Anthony.  I don't like that remark.  That's phoning it in remark.  That is – can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  Wait, you're breaking up.  Hold on.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.  I can hear it.  Phone it in, you mother – I – phone it in. 
[01:36:00]  Does anybody understand?  Look, I worked for a living.  I understand how hard people work on a daily basis.  I'm not even getting into that.  I'm getting into – not the physical labor aspect of this job, but there is a pressure to entertain on a daily basis.  What I do is difficult in that I have a lot of rules to abide by, more so than I've ever had in my life. 
[01:36:30]  I would love to do a lot of bits and things that were benchmarks of this program years ago.  It can't be done.  I'm sure there are people that would love to bust out the fire hoses at Juneteenth.  That can't be done either anymore.  It just – it can't be done.  There are things I want to say and do that aren't able to be done anymore.  If this idiot can't see that, that we can't do the Mike Tyson bit anymore. 
[01:37:00]  Well, really fast, because we're on XM.  They play a lot of our old material.  That was part of the deal.  We were allowed to take all our old shows and give them to XM so they can replay them.  Anthony and I will sit there sometimes.  We'll hear a replay of an old bit we did at NEW, and we sit there in amazement.  We're like, oh, my God, how did this ever get on the air?  Yeah.  Obviously, it would never get on the air today, but we're even saying, how did it get on the air back then?  It's just times change, and the way people perceive things change, the power people get changes, and things have changed over the years. 
[01:37:30]  So if he feels I'm phoning this in, when I sit there at night, pretty much from the time I get home till the time I go to bed, it's looking at crap to do stuff with on this radio show.  That's what I do on a nightly basis.  I barely go out.  On Thursday, we have our fun little poker game, and the rest of the time is spent researching and doing material, getting material and learning things and just getting stuff for the show. 
[01:38:00]  It's extremely difficult to do a radio show in this climate, because then a lot of people would say, well, why don't you just go over to XM full time, because you could do a lot more over there, which is a fact.  We still like the challenge over here.  We like the fact that we're going to try to figure out and abide by the rules in place and see if we could still do an entertaining, clever, funny show. 
[01:38:30]  There's still room for comedy and having a fun show on FM radio.  Absolutely.  We're still trying to figure that out.  We're reinventing ourselves as we speak.  I think because the climate is so difficult, he perceives that as us not trying as hard, and it's psycho.  This guy would love to see us blow ourselves up again.  Just go on the air and say something.  You honestly think they threw Don Imus off the air. 
[01:39:00]  You know better than anybody, John, how much that guy was billing.  That station was billing huge amounts of money with Don Imus, and they threw him off the air.  What do you think could happen to us?  And we almost got thrown off the air recently, so we haven't even really changed our tune that much.  We're still pushing it to the point that we just went through a 30-day suspension.  The guy doesn't seem to understand.  From satellite, where you're supposed to be able to do more.  Right.  Don't you understand how insane this is?  The guy doesn't seem to understand that the climate has changed, and we must change along 
[01:39:30]  with it, or end up drinking Mountain Dew at 6 in the morning with you.  Writing passive-aggressive emails to people.  Yeah, blaming people for your unemployment.  Enough!  I'll say it again.  You understand how insane it is to get suspended for 30 days from your satellite radio show.  Yeah.  Where almost anything goes.  Right.  I mean, that says a lot right there. 
[01:40:00]  And I don't exec-produce anymore, really.  Really.  I'm not battling with Tom to the point we can barely talk to each other at this point.  I'm not sticking up for the show and pushing as far as I can for the good of the show.  Hey, John, where were you going upstairs to management?  You were considered management.  Where was he going upstairs to management and trying to get things put across and saying,  hey, lighten up.  Let these guys do this or this. 
[01:40:30]  I didn't hear anything like that going on.  So just stop with the blame game.  It's radio.  It's the climate in society these days that is detrimental to the talk format.  That's why talk radio really is having a hard time across the entire country these days.  Unless you're a political talker, Sean Hannity, something like that.  And that's like the last avenue of talk radio that will be taken over by people with agendas. 
[01:41:00]  Because right now they've got the safety net of, hey, I'm talking politics here.  This is our ideology.  Comedy, though.  Comedy talk.  We're pretty much it.  We're pretty much it.  That's on the edge.  That's still in the paper.  Getting suspended.  Almost fired.  Not getting thrown off.  There's no one left.  We're the last dinosaur heading toward that tar pit.  Heading toward the tar pit.  That's what we are.  We're a lumbering dinosaur heading for a tar pit.  Yeah, trust me, we're looking around to see if there's another way. 
[01:41:30]  All right, we are.  Yeah.  But we have pea brains.  This guy's an ass.  I don't understand.  I am so sick of the people that I help in this business and then they turn around and trash me.  That thinks it's 1995.  I have another, ah, for another day.  I'll put it this way.  Someone has been harassing me for a really long time.  Someone that I helped in this business.  An old employee has been harassing me to no end. 
[01:42:00]  And all I did was try to help this person.  All I did was hire him numerous times.  But he's blaming me for his firing.  What the F did I do to you?  Except protect you and make sure you still had a job.  Way past the point where the company wanted to get rid of you.  People get that.  What do I get for that?  That's why I can't talk to anyone anymore.  What do I get?  Harassing phone calls and text messages and thousands of emails and other things that I can't discuss at this time because there's things going on now because of it. 
[01:42:30]  Unbelievable.  I'm just so sick of this crap.  Listen to the hour you spent yesterday with the animal rights lady.  Doesn't understand the show.  Some people liked Marge yesterday.  Okay.  Here's the deal with our radio show.  We take chances.  We put people on the air.  Sometimes we fail miserably.  We're the first ones to admit that.  But you've got to be brave enough to go for some things.  We've had radio gold with Marge.  I love Marge.  So John maybe didn't like the Marge phone call yesterday. 
[01:43:00]  Maybe some of the faithful listeners didn't like the Marge call yesterday.  That's fine.  But that's what happens when you're trying to create.  You have to take chances with things.  You don't know how it's going to play out until you do it.  That's always been the show.  That hasn't changed.  And that's why we are successful.  This is one of the reasons we are successful, because we do take chances with our radio show.  Most radio guys aren't brave enough to take chances.  They go for all the safe stuff over and over again. 
[01:43:30]  So he should understand that.  Apparently not.  I guess I got madder than usual last night because yet another person said,  these are the guys you think are so great.  Well, I'm assuming it's someone from his inner circle.  And we're not trying to reach those type of people.  We're just not.  I mean, John, if he had it his way, he wants political talk, current news driven,  no outrageous stunts or any of that stuff.  That's one of the many things we do with our radio show. 
[01:44:00]  He wants Bob Grant.  He's a huge fan of Bob Grant.  Couldn't be Bob Grant in today's radio.  How about that one, John?  He was fired for it.  There it is.  Yeah, there's a perfect example of what has happened to radio over the years.  Bob got in trouble years ago.  But now, could you imagine Bob Grant now saying the things that he used to say  that made him what he was on radio?  It can't be done.  He's a prime example. 
[01:44:30]  And I love Bob Grant.  I think he was hysterical.  But it's just, it can't work on the radio now.  Right.  And then finally, number seven, you're on 20-some stations.  You won't be after the book.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Thanks, John.  What are you, Kreskin?  Well, you know what?  He's Kreskin now predicting the future.  I'll tell you this much.  If stations start dropping us after the next book, I feel good with the show we're doing,  and I know we gave it our all in this climate.  And I'm fine with that.  I'm absolutely fine with that. 
[01:45:00]  If we lost all the stations tomorrow, we still have our satellite radio show, which we're proud of as well.  So whatever.  Whatever's going to happen is going to happen.  I know we're not phoning in, and I know we're trying the best we can under this climate that we're in, and so be it.  I can sleep at night knowing that we gave it the old college try.  Phoning it in.  And then he writes another.  Then I guess he – hey, John – all right.  Well, this is a forward to me. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, John, as long as ONA are publicly ridiculing your critique, which I'm sure you knew what happened, would you like to post it to the board?  So I guess he's been sending this email around to his friends, but there's some weird thing that John has with the company, so nothing can be posted, I guess.  Because it's obvious that Alan from the New York Radio Message Board got the same email that he supposedly was sending me, but because he's passive-aggressive, he's blind CCing everybody on this.  It's so obvious Alan has read this but can't post it because of some deal that John made with the company. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  Very obvious in this email that was just sent.  So then John writes back, and, of course, he CCs you and I.  He writes, if I did it myself, I might be seen to violate the mutual non-disparagement agreement I have with CBS.  See what he's doing?  All behind the scenes and emails like, here, this is what I think, but don't post it.  I'm too scared for you to post it.  Oh, but you're aggressive, John?  But you're aggressive?  Can I clear something up with the listeners? 
[01:46:30]  We're not mad at Liza Minnelli.  God, people are stupid.  Mutual non-disparagement agreement I have with CBS.  So I'm copying ONA on the reply, and they could forward the email to you if they want.  It is totally okay with me.  Fine.  We'll send the email to Alan Sniffin.  Give him a big plug today.  It'll be on the New York Radio Message Board.  Maybe it'll be part of Board Reflections.  It'll be on the New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah.  No problem.  Give him, John, some press. 
[01:47:00]  There you go.  Oh, really?  Hey, Tham.  Holding up dirty words.  I've never seen anybody more scared to hold up a sign than he has been with that break.  He's been waving that.  Oh, it's just this tentative.  It's like waving a cowboy flag in Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia.  It's like this little tentative break.  If you want, you can break any time.  And you know what?  And here it is.  Oh, boy.  And this is what we deal with every day.  You got one listener.  He writes, I loved the March phone call from yesterday. 
[01:47:30]  I thought it was one of her best appearances on your show.  The next email, I agree with John on the March thing.  See?  And that's what we have to deal with.  So what do you do?  What do you do?  See, John wants us to do current event-driven talk and political talk for the most part.  Guess what?  There are other listeners that want other things.  They still want us to do the 55-gallon drum challenge and things of that ilk.  You know what I really enjoy?  There's a type of humor I really enjoy, and it's stereotype, race-based humor. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Isn't it wonderful?  I love it.  It rules.  It's funny.  It's fun to do.  It's hurtful.  It's hurtful.  It makes people like – it shocks people a little, but they laugh, too.  People have always said the best time they've had listening to radio is when the host says stuff that you think about but couldn't ever say at work or anywhere else. 
[01:48:30]  That has been taken away from the radio host.  I love race-based stereotype humor.  A lot of people do.  Surprise!  That tool has been taken out of the toolbox of the talk show host.  Because now there is a – volumes – there are volumes of books that tell you why you can't do that anymore.  If I tried to do it on these very airwaves, you wouldn't hear it.  It would be dumped out of, no matter how innocent. 
[01:49:00]  Jokes that children tell on the playground can't be told here on this radio station because words hurt, as we are told in a pamphlet I had to read from an effing lawyer.  Words hurt.  Do they?  Then change the goddamn channel and let us have fun.  That's something that people – who I thought John understood but apparently doesn't.  I'm hoping at some point the pendulum swings the other way and we're able to really kind of get back into doing that again. 
[01:49:30]  I think it will, by the way.  Everything goes in cycles.  Eventually.  I think people are going to get sick of the PC crap.  I've been thinking that since 1995 and they haven't gotten sick of it.  It's just gotten worse and worse.  I know.  I know.  There are stereotypes.  There are Asian stereotypes that I'd love to talk about.  I'd love to bring up my drive home more.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ on the cross.  I would love to do that.  I did.  I did.  I was watching Rescue Me again last night. 
[01:50:00]  They did a whole Asian stereotype bit that was hilarious on last night's show that I was watching.  You can't do it.  I was staring at my TV.  My mouth was agape.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And Rescue Me is only a few years old.  It's not like this is all in the family.  Yep.  What?  I think it's season two I'm on.  So that's what?  Two years ago?  A couple years old.  That's it.  Two years ago.  Don't you look and go, oh, my God.  Don't you think that like don't you get all like kind of nervous for the show? 
[01:50:30]  You watch and go, oh, oh, oh, oh, boy, that could be trouble.  You know, that's that's the world we're living in.  It sucks.  Believe me, it sucks.  It totally sucks.  But don't perceive it as us like phoning it in.  Phoning it in.  Doing a 25%, you know, a 25% effort.  You know more than the listeners, John.  You're just not being fair.  There'd be 20 friggin different organizations banging on the door downstairs if we ran through  a show doing all the material we want to do on a daily basis. 
[01:51:00]  And his answer to that would be, well, then just do it.  You're rebels.  Right.  OK.  And then we'll be doing a show for each other like we did for two years.  Yeah, for two years we spent doing a show for each other on the phone.  And that was why that was us phoning it in to each other.  See, the show.  We're no good to our listeners who depend on the show and still do find the show entertaining.  We're no good to our listeners if we're not doing the show, John.  If we're fired.  We learned that lesson when we had to sit out for two years.  We learned that lesson big time. 
[01:51:30]  See, just like you're no good sending critique memos to us after you've been fired.  Imagine that.  I'd love to show up at a job I don't work at anymore and just keep working.  What are you doing, John?  Go out.  Get a girl.  Have some fun.  Treat her to some Mountain Dew.  Don't write memos about our show.  You don't have to listen anymore.  It's not your job.  I'm going to go back to Apollo air conditioning and just start putting up duct work.  Why don't you move on?  He wants to do something with the Internet. 
[01:52:00]  He was trying to talk me into like blowing up XM and stuff and going with porno.  Just some kind of Internet thing he's starting.  It's like Mountain Dew.com.  He doesn't even acknowledge that satellite radio is doing well.  It's like, oh, no, we'll do it on the Internet.  So we'll do the exact thing that XM and Sirius are doing, but we'll do it on the Internet.  Because they're failing miserably with all their subscribers.  Really?  Really?  I'm like, you're insane, man.  You really are.  Well, the guy's giving us a show today. 
[01:52:30]  Got to tell you that.  Got to give him credit for that.  Thank you.  Giving us a little bit of a show today.  Unbelievable.  Off the subject.  Hey, by the way, if you want to go.  Go ahead, Jim.  No, no, no, there's no rhyme or reason, honest to God.  But as you guys are talking, I am at full staff.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh.  Just go ahead.  I had to let you know that.  I'm listening.  I agree.  And yet, the blood...  See, you so agree.  It's getting you so excited.  It's getting me riled up.  Yes. 
[01:53:00]  You're riled up, all right.  Well, listen.  It's on fire.  You're talking about racial humor.  It's natural.  Listen, man.  I don't know.  You know, the listeners don't really like the show anymore, but maybe there's one or two  out there.  One or two.  Maybe a couple of you.  Hopefully.  That want to go see us at Mohegan Sun.  I don't know, though.  I don't think they're going to really appreciate us doing a show up there at the casino.  That was part of his memo, by the way.  Oh, you went seven minutes without talking about your comedy show. 
[01:53:30]  Now, you know what we could be doing as far as promoting this comedy show?  Stop.  Well, we realized that there's a huge percent of the audience that don't care about that,  so we're trying to just hit it enough so we get the word out.  Anyway, we're not giving away tickets right now.  We're just promoting it.  Mohegan Sun is a week from Saturday.  And a week from Friday, we're going to be broadcasting from up there.  I hope so.  We're trying to figure that out at The Wolf.  And we're hoping some of you that still like the show. 
[01:54:00]  Hopefully, there's a few who will come and say hi to us.  Hopefully.  Yeah, it's a great show.  And all the comics you know and like from this mediocre disaster we call a radio show,  we would love you to come out and see.  Jones Beach was amazing.  It was fun.  It was fun.  And maybe someone could bring me a newspaper because I just don't feel like reading anymore.  I didn't have my newspapers out this morning, by the way.  Well, when Kenny is not here, the whole place goes to pot.  I had no fruit.  I had nothing. 
[01:54:30]  Did you get the Kenny phone call yesterday?  Oh, no.  Mike will.  Why would you answer it?  We have to do it after the break because we're so late.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and now you pissed him off.  That's Kenny's replacement.  Well, Kenny did a poor job of informing Mike.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You're good.  You're good.  Well, what would you do if the stocky psycho is staring at you?  You're good.  Would it be like your fruit?  I love my fruit.  With the flat top that went out 15 years ago.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Not in his job.  No, I know.  You know who he has hair like?  He has hair like Frank in Mississippi Burning.  Gene Hackman should be grabbing your crotch while you fall off a chair. 
[01:55:00]  Or who was the...  Michael Rooker.  The mission control guy in Apollo 13.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Ed Harris.  Ed Harris.  Ed Harris in Apollo 13.  Yeah, but he's got his hair.  That's not fair to Mike.  Mike's got all his hair.  No, well, they put like a wig on him.  Okay, you got it.  Mike looks like every guy that was ever unjustly acquitted of a Klan attack.  So here's the deal.  Just reminding you guys that the comedy tour goes to Mohegan Sun a week from Saturday. 
[01:55:30]  Hopefully, we'll be at the Wolf on Friday, next Friday.  And tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  It's nine comedians from the show that you know and love.  All the info as we go along and some of the articles we do, promoting the thing, and some  of the videos and things that we're doing at the venues, we got one place you could go  and that's Virus Tour, one word on MySpace for all the info.  Okay?  Right.  Future dates and all that.  And of course, because we got to get it in.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Always worth it.  They're going to be sponsoring my leaks soon. 
[01:56:00]  Nice.  Soapy and Anthony.  Does that sound low to you guys or no?  Now it's loud.  See if we were rebels, we would play it real loud.  That's right.  Celebrating a rock.  We're a little scared, so it should be at this level.  We're scared, so let's just keep it at this level.  Welcome back to the Timid Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:56:30]  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Florida.  Kevin.  Kevin.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  I first want to start off with saying I really enjoy your show.  I know you don't care, but I really do.  Thank you.  You know what?  You know what?  We do care, okay?  I just tore down one of the walls there of radio.  We do care.  We do care.  We care too much.  We like to have fun with you guys and hang up on you and do all that crap, but guess what?  In the end, we do care.  So thanks, Kevin.  What, sir?  Okay.  And, Jimmy, I saw you in West Palm Beach. 
[01:57:00]  I think you killed.  Oh, thank you.  And just one thing, Jimmy.  I mean, you have to eat on the air, bro.  I mean, it's one thing to hear you eat, but to hear you swallow, I just hear you getting  fatter over the air, man.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You know what it was?  Hold on.  I try not to.  Sometimes it's hard because I'm a growing boy.  But today, there was a very long first break, and I had to have my blueberries, and I had to  have...  But I'm not getting fatter, sir.  No.  I'm a little compliment for somebody who's been hitting the old heavy bag.  Excuse me.  Who turned you on to the blueberries? 
[01:57:30]  You weren't eating blueberries before me.  God.  And what about the pink grapefruit you're now eating?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Blueberries and grapefruit.  Exactly.  To eat the worst fruit on the face of the earth.  Blueberries rule.  Blueberries are too tart, and grapefruit, don't even get me started.  It's sour.  You're eating a sour orange.  But it's good for you.  Oranges are sweet and luscious.  They suck.  Grapefruits are horrid.  Oh, God.  Oranges are...  Hey, how about you phone in with your favorite fruit, people? 
[01:58:00]  I was just about to say, here comes another memo.  Say, proving my point.  You can only talk about fruit now.  It's Favorite Fruit Thursday.  Should be Friday, because that would be the triple F, Favorite Fruit Friday.  All right, Kevin, so your point is?  The point is, man, I would just let this go.  Man, you guys have given this guy too much time.  I listen to quite a few talk shows.  Yeah, I understand.  Everybody's lost a lot of freedom in the radio business, man.  It's very unfortunate.  I would just let it go and just do your show.  I wouldn't give this jackass...  I wouldn't even say his name anymore, man.  It's interesting when we get calls like you, because we get this when we talk about Howard, 
[01:58:30]  let's say.  Just let it go.  We do let things go.  Today, we're not.  Today, it's our thing.  It got under our skin.  And it didn't get under my skin in the way John thinks.  He goes, I obviously got to.  Yeah, you got to me because you were hiding behind emails.  You didn't call.  And half the shit was dripping.  Oh.  You got 15 more minutes before you can say that, Opie.  Oh, never mind.  All right.  Well, the whole email was dripping. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  And it was so natural.  I didn't catch it, dude.  Oh, it just came right across.  Because I didn't explain myself.  He got to me because I hate passive aggressive people that hide behind keyboards.  Everyone knows that.  I hate these people on message boards that have no problem trashing you personally or the show,  but they just hide.  They hide.  And that's what John did.  He could have called me at any time if he had some kind of problem.  We did talk here and there when he was the PD of this radio station. 
[01:59:30]  That's where he got me.  Yes, you're absolutely right.  To Kevin saying, just do the show and don't give him the time of day or don't entertain him or whatever,  that's what we were doing.  If we had talked about this every time we got an email or saw a posting on a message board or something like that,  you'd have really hurt us going off.  He went on the New York radio message board and –  Pretty much the day after the format changed.  And he trashed us and we didn't even give it a minute on our show. 
[02:00:00]  I was actually – I read that post and I – ask anybody because I talk to a lot of people about it.  I was trying to figure out a way that maybe he was being sarcastic or trying to be funny but I wasn't getting it.  Like I couldn't possibly fathom that he had these feelings based on what I had seen the day before and the way he acted around us during the time he spent here with us and the way he acted on his last day here.  And the next – pretty much that night I saw a posting on a message board and I'm like, is that really Minnelli? 
[02:00:30]  And did he really write that?  And am I reading this properly?  And I didn't respond to it because I couldn't possibly fathom that he would have done something like that.  So like juvenile pretty much posting on a message board like that.  And, you know, I wrote him back just with a simple like, was this you?  Never got a response.  And he talks about how I knew info that he didn't and I didn't give it to him and all that.  You know that the last day that he was employed or the day that Tom had that meeting in the conference room and announcing to the staff that they were changing formats and he invited John, which was a professional thing to do. 
[02:01:00]  And, you know, that was cool of Tom.  You know that John walked in here, looked us all in the eyes, shook our hands and stuff.  Like he obviously had a problem before then, but this is what I mean about passive-aggressive.  He had that chance.  We were eye to eye.  And what did I get?  A handshake and a pretty much good luck to you guys.  This sucks.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  That's all.  That's all we got that day. 
[02:01:30]  He could say whatever he wanted right in my face.  And that's what got under my skin and got me pissed today.  All that crap.  I hate it and always have.  You know, I put myself in ridiculous situations because I speak my mind.  Ridiculous situations.  You know, and then you get people that hide on message boards and they think they're cool.  You know, they never show their face or use their real names.  Can't even show their real picture.  There's guys on our fan sites.  They show their sig pic.  Yeah, I know.  And some of these guys trash us. 
[02:02:00]  Guess what?  I respect you.  I absolutely respect you because you got an opinion.  You're speaking your mind.  And you're doing it in your real voice with your real face.  Yeah.  Not with some made up screen name with like a picture of Chuck Connors because you're like a 90.  Chuck Connors again.  Because you're some 90 pound weakling hiding behind a keyboard.  So you have to like beef yourself up with some picture of somebody else that you wish you were.  Yeah, 90 pound weakling.  Not our list.  Well, didn't you say Chuck Connors earlier?  30 pound weakling.  Did you say Chuck Connors? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I was just going back to that.  I put it in the air.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Please.  I'm glad someone else used it.  Obviously, Chuck Norris is what I was getting at there.  I love Chuck Connors.  And the other thing, because this has taken over the show.  John, how great does John think we are?  And look, this is not me saying this.  This is kind of an observation.  How great does John think we are that we could actually call it in on a radio show, make really good money, and be syndicated across America, and be heard on XM, and no one fires us? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  It's not like we're on for six months and then we get the boot.  We go years with a job.  Right.  It's not like six months and then we get another gig six months later somewhere else.  We are employed until we screw up and get fired, usually with very good ratings and a very bad reputation.  Look, things might change, but the reason we're still on the air is because we have a value to this company.  No one gets a chance on radio to just call it in. 
[02:03:30]  Imagine if they're talking about firing us right now and they're telling us after the show.  Wouldn't that suck?  That would be embarrassing.  You know what?  How embarrassing.  It would be hilarious.  It would really be funny, but we would laugh so hard behind the scenes, but then in front of the TV, we'd have to cry and make believe.  We're bummed out, but now we got our days free and we can do whatever the hell we want with all the money that we have in the bank.  What did I say?  I don't know, but I'd like to.  What?  I don't want my days free. 
[02:04:00]  I bought a couple of too many toys.  I need more money.  I bought a BlackBerry and I'm nervous.  Do you realize, and I'm not going for a woe is me, I'm really sick this week.  Really sick.  My throat actually was closing up.  I thought I had to go to the emergency room.  I know.  I felt a little tinge.  It hurt me.  And the reason I'm here is because we are paranoid and we don't, you don't even get the chance to call it in when you're sick.  No.  We rarely take sick days because we're paranoid.  You can't, we don't even have that luxury. 
[02:04:30]  You know what calling it in is playing a Jim Brewer bit 45 minutes before the show is over so you can go home.  No, that's what we used to do at NEW.  That's what's so funny about, like, where we sit, that's why a lot of this is so funny because there's so much inside crap that it takes forever to explain.  But yeah, back in the day at NEW, we actually kind of called it in.  Do you remember when we had huge ratings and we're like, hey, you know what, we could kind of slide a little bit today.  I want to go play golf or whatever it was.  So yeah, let's just blow off the last 45 minutes of our show. 
[02:05:00]  Remember when we did a bit and we decided like maybe two hours later we'd replay it again and then replay it again the next day?  Does anyone remember those days when out of the four hours of radio that we did, we probably did two?  Yeah.  Yeah, we would get a great bit in the first 15 minutes.  Sometimes we'd play it twice.  Play it twice and then again the next day, of course.  We had this rule where we would play things three or four times before we thought the audience got sick of it. 
[02:05:30]  You know what?  We'd throw a frigging song on sometimes.  Yeah.  Sometimes we'd just go, you know something, there's a new song out, here's a band, we really just want to kind of play this.  Boom, that song would go on.  You know that we rarely replay things now?  I mean the whole XM replay thing is its own entity.  That's different.  But as far as a bit we do on the show and then actually replaying it, we rarely do that compared to what we used to do.  No, it's at least five hours of just straight through talk radio.  That's it.  But, I mean. 
[02:06:00]  Phoning it in, that's an insult.  That's him just trying to get under his skin because he knows that's impossible in radio.  No one gets the opportunity to just phone it in.  You just can't.  Yeah.  There's too much at stake.  Michelle Trechtenberg have a nose job.  Does she get a nose job?  Which one is she?  She was in Harriet the Spy as a little girl and then she was in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  There's a chick with a big neck on CW11.  There's a girl with a...  Whoa, giraffe neck.  Look at the size of her neck. 
[02:06:30]  She's a very famous actress, but I can't...  What was she in?  Think of her name or...  Oh, she's Than Knows.  Than Knows.  Just go to Than.  What's her biggest movie?  Impossible to Strangle?  God Almighty.  I've never seen a bigger neck on a person.  Yeah, go ahead.  No, never mind.  I don't remember her name.  Oh, Than, I'm sorry.  She's in Basic Instinct.  She was the nice girl that ends up getting blamed for everything.  Basic Instinct?  Wow.  What a reference.  John Minnelli's not happy with you.  That's a movie that's 20 years old.  How did you know she was in that? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Don.  Oh, we were with him.  He's still on.  Sorry, Kevin.  Can I say one more thing, man?  Yeah.  Sure.  Sorry to interrupt you.  Down here in Florida, we got like half a dozen local radio stations, and we got quite  a few syndicated, like Alexa Terry, Bob and Tom, the piece of crap man, Kyle.  We got all that down here.  I click you guys on at 6 o'clock every morning.  I love the show.  You guys are always topical.  You hit on what's interesting all the time.  You never go on pandions, except for when it comes time to what you can and cannot stay on  radio, and I mean, I know you guys can. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, and everybody's limited, but you guys are pushing the envelope to as far as you  can go, and it's awesome, man.  It's awesome.  So I just want to say, you guys are doing one hell of a job, and I just say, keep it  up, and I wouldn't worry about, you know, what happened.  Jesus, how long are you going to go on about this?  Thank you.  We kind of needed Kevin's phone call today.  We need to feel good.  We were feeling bad about ourselves.  So thank you, Kevin.  John made us feel bad.  See, we control the direction of the show.  If we're feeling like we're back into a corner, we'll take positive calls about the show. 
[02:08:00]  Can I...  What?  Just to help our recalls.  This is what happened.  It's a very bad story.  Yeah?  Is it?  A Pennsylvania crossing guard faces 1,000 sex charges and assaults against seven children.  1,000 sex charges?  He's a crossing guard.  Anyone who likes working around kids, you're a creep.  Yeah, I think so.  On some level.  Because most people don't like kids, especially, you know, if they're your own kids, that's 
[02:08:30]  one thing.  You kind of got to like them, I guess.  But to work around children that aren't your own, why?  To want to go out there with a sign that says stop while vehicles are going, to allow  a bunch of kids who don't like you, they think you're a creep, and in this case, they're  right.  A thousand times over.  What do you want to do for a living?  I don't know.  In all weather, I'd like to stand outside in a slicker.  I'd like to wear a slicker with glowing strips on and use my body as a sandbag to protect 
[02:09:00]  these little shits.  At this point, it's screwing.  Hey, is it a he or a she?  Oh, it's a guy.  Women don't win.  So why does a guy use his own advice that's on that sign?  Stop.  He probably looked at that like a stuff message.  But yet, whenever it was turned to go, he would give them all a little smack on the 
[02:09:30]  ass with it as they crossed the street.  What a ghoul.  No, he didn't actually have a stop sign.  He would hold up a proceed with caution.  By the way, Patty McGee from Jersey.  Hey, Patty McGee, don't you know?  Faithful listener to the show.  You douches used to play effing foosball during the show.  Ah, those were the days.  It really was.  Anthony would be outside like William Holden, stuck his own beers.  Just drinking, smoking, playing foosball.  Those were the days.  Stinky smoked dope.  I looked at prostitutes on Craigslist in Ben's office. 
[02:10:00]  It was awful.  That was our show.  That was the show.  And Ken would walk around in his stupid tie and wonder how he could get rid of him.  Because he'd be around once every month.  Ken, our boss would check in.  You guys all right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Goodbye.  There he is with his baggage flying off to Washington or Philly or whatever.  Right, right.  And we'd have the run of the joint.  Oh, boy, did we.  You're right.  Those were the days for us.  I hated every single person that was working on the show.  It was such a weird time, man. 
[02:10:30]  God forbid I got some happiness in my life.  And I'm enjoying myself more.  But as far as the station underperforming, I do have to say, even at the peak of the ratings,  I mean, you guys were killing.  And it was a tough sell then, even.  Well, that's the inside stuff that, I mean, if we had hours, we could do this.  Like, when John goes, I got fired because you guys were, you didn't perform better than you were.  That's crazy because at NEW, we were the only station.  Well, Ron and Fez at the end were doing very well, yes. 
[02:11:00]  Yes.  And, you know, people weren't losing their jobs.  They weren't changing formats.  They just kept trying new shows.  Yeah.  Over and over and over.  Right.  There were basically no ratings in all the other day parts except for Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  And they took a little time for traction.  But the company believed in them and knew they had something.  Yeah.  The company, unfortunately, did not believe in a lot of the shows they had on this station, John.  You know that.  John and Jeff, though, we got to get them back. 
[02:11:30]  Yes.  It's so weird to walk in here and hear music playing.  And not that babble.  I don't know.  They even grew on me in a weird way.  Like, you ever listen to this?  Sometimes there's just people who you'd kind of like to murder, and yet you can listen to them on the way in.  By the way, we didn't do any perv news today.  Here's a quickie before we move off the air.  A New Jersey lawyer with some big political connections is free without bail this morning, accused of lewd behavior.  Now, cops say Christopher Dahl sexually gratified himself in front of two women at a Flemington shopping center. 
[02:12:00]  They say he was wearing nothing but glasses, socks, and a hands-free headset.  A witness wrote down Dahl's license plate number as he drove off and later picked him out of a lineup.  Dahl served in a variety of state posts.  How'd they pick him out of a lineup?  He was the one nude man with a wireless headset?  Almighty, good thinking.  And socks on and glasses.  Hands-free.  Glasses.  You've got to love this guy.  Maybe we can start with this tomorrow because there's so much to this. 
[02:12:30]  It's that whole perv switch we like talking about.  Yep.  Well, I guess it's hard and cold.  Oh, well.  If you want to join us at the other place, feel free.  You don't have to.  Oh, there it is.  Somebody leaked his memo.  No.  That memo couldn't drip out.  No.  He needed us to send it to Alan because he was too scared of the agreement he made with  the company.  Oh, there it is.  But he's going to try to claim that he's an aggressive person. 
[02:13:00]  Do you understand what I've been saying today?  So he actually had to go to us and tell Alan to ask us if we could send it in to Alan.  Guess what?  Opie and Anthony sent that memo to Alan Sniffin.  Alan says, here's the text of John's final critique of O&A that was forwarded to me.  And then it says, not by John.  Yeah.  But John will claim he's aggressive.  Really, John?  It sounds like you kind of like money, too.  Hey, what's the matter, John?  Why didn't you just send it?  What's wrong with liking money, John?  Come on.  Looks like you like your own money.  What's the matter?  Because if you're an aggressive person, you should have sent it right over to Alan. 
[02:13:30]  But instead, you blind CC'd everyone, didn't you?  When you read it.  And had little secret discussions as you're drinking your Mountain Dew in the middle of the night, you weirdo.  When you read this, just notice the dripping sarcasm and just bitterness in this.  And I'm saying I will have a response on that very message board to his critique.  I said it on the air, but I'll put it in text form and write that down as a response. 
[02:14:00]  Wearing suits that they wore in Dealey Plaza, you weirdo.  And you want to be this rebel.  How about you dress like one?  But you're aggressive, right?  Yeah, I see it.  I see it.  You're aggressive.  Everything you do proves you're not.  Blind CC, blind CC.  Call me on the secret number. 
[02:14:30]  If this gets out, I'll lose the money.  And the agreement I made with the company.  Blind CC, blind CC.  Send, send, send.  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Let me use my top secret email that only a few people know.  You're a phony.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:15:00]  Can I have a cup of coffee, please?  Good job.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  Right here.  We can't control anything.  So that music's blasting.  It's hard to start the show.  It's not like radio.  I guess I could turn it down like this.  Oh.  Oh, that works.  But then I have to turn it back up for the phone calls.  Say it's on the same pot.  Jesus.  Who turns it down?  All right.  They could turn it down at the other joint. 
[02:16:00]  It's a phone call and you want some pot?  What?  Why?  Why?  What happened, you're on?  What?  Hold on.  What?  It screws with the relay.  What if we want it off right now?  I think they might lose us.  All right.  Who's running the Rage Against the Machine music?  Butch is right now.  All right.  Why didn't Butch turn it down when it was obvious that we needed it turned down?  Because he's a douchebag.  Certainly.  He's probably busy rapping. 
[02:16:30]  You guys are getting ripped apart by Mike North this morning.  It's so funny.  Who's Mike North?  The guy from yesterday.  He's the guy from yesterday on the 670 The Score.  What is he?  Go ahead.  Attack their pal talker home again, everybody.  Thank you.  Please.  Listen.  Just pound him.  Could someone get me Mike North's phone number?  He's the guy who is...  Where's Mike North? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, pal talker.  There's another room raid on Mike North's pal talker room.  I don't even know who he is.  He's the guy in Chicago who they...  That did the pal talk thing.  Now I know.  But I mean, I don't know him by name.  Yeah.  What is it?  670...  I'll invite you.  Yeah, invite me.  Let me look.  Let me look.  I'm going to get...  Let's see how long it takes me to get bounced when I just...  I'm going to plug obscenities just in here.  Okay.  Let me see.  Mike is a cunt. 
[02:17:30]  There it is.  I'll just copy-paste, copy-paste, and see how long it takes me to get booted.  Well, Scott Owen from Chicago.  What is he saying?  You can't just say you guys are getting ripped apart by Mike North this morning.  It's so funny.  What is he saying?  Yeah, what's he saying?  Huh? 
[02:18:00]  I want to...  I wish there was a way...  There's no way to leave it on top, right?  No.  I know.  It's not your fault, sweetie.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wow.  Still no walkover calling in the XM show once again.  9.15 to 10.45 with two commercial breaks.  First of all, we can't do a walkover.  Fucking hack ass bitches, lame-ass fuckwaz, complain, complain, complain.  We can't do a walkover when the fucking...  We're in the same building.  They're doing the studio.  Why am I yelling?  I bet this gets to you, huh, Greg?  Yeah.  It got to me.  That's why I read it. 
[02:18:30]  Mike North, I want to see his PalTalk room.  Eric's trying to get the contact information.  You know what the worst thing is?  All my pals from PalTalk are in this room.  All the admins.  Gary's in here.  Everybody.  And I'm just copy and pasting Mike is a cunt over and over again.  Aren't you going to get banned?  Yeah, they're going to bounce me from the room, I'm sure.  I don't care.  This is a G-rated room.  It's a G-rated room, all P for garbage. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, God.  All right, let's go to George in Chicago.  George, what's up?  Hey, there, George.  George.  Yeah.  Are you there?  During your last commercial break on FM side, Mike North, I was flipping around.  He was saying you guys are tools, that you guys are kind of creation of Joel Hollander,  and it's not working here in Chicago.  And also that you guys are supposed to be so cutting edge.  You know, what are they going to apologize for next? 
[02:19:30]  He's just a douche.  Is that the best he has?  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, because that, whatever.  All right.  Oh, apparently they got me on some kind of a filter?  Yeah.  Can't see you.  Fuckers.  I wrote all that Mike is a cunt for nothing?  Shit.  How do you do that one?  Well, can you write something?  Maybe they're filtering certain words.  So just write something nice.  Mike's a goose.  See, we're too lazy to figure out that you can do that.  We can do that in our own pal talk room.  Oh, we don't care, right?  Wait a minute.  I'll write hi.  There.  Did that show through?  Your message, text message is calling disabled from the room. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, they disabled text from me.  Oh, yeah.  They should have.  You're a little potty mouth.  Bastard.  Text him, boy.  So, no one's interesting about guys like Mike North.  He says that we're not working in Chicago and all that, right?  But he gets this pal talk idea from the Opie and Anthony show.  I mean, the hypocrisy just amazes me.  If we're not working, then why are you just taking the pal talk idea if we're not working? 
[02:20:30]  We're on your radar in some way, obviously.  Yeah, absolutely.  Chris in Chicago, what's up?  And once again, if we're not working in Chicago, then get rid of us in Chicago.  I beg the company, get rid of us in Chicago if we're not working.  We've been on the air for over a year in Chicago.  Radio shows don't get the chance to do a year in a city.  Maybe an overnight guy because no one's listening, but morning guys don't get a year unless something's happening. 
[02:21:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Sorry.  I don't know if you guys know, but Mike North started out as a hot dog vendor.  A hot dog, man.  Did he?  Really?  Did he serve him with his mouth or up his ass?  On the north side of Chicago.  He went around with a hot dog up his hiney hole.  And they gave him air time.  His number.  They don't get him on the phone.  Why does he need four pal talk admins in that room? 
[02:21:30]  There are four of them.  Red name.  Those are the big bosses.  And actually, like, the owner of Pal Talk, I think, is in that room.  Probably because he was getting killed yesterday.  Yesterday.  And he probably threatened to complain on the radio if they didn't do something.  Here's his number.  312-644-6767.  312-644-6767.  Have fun.  Serious calls only.  Have fun.  But that's probably because he had to complain that they got destroyed in his own room. 
[02:22:00]  Have fun taking your calls now.  And he's saying.  Love a good battle.  And he's saying that we're not doing well in Chicago.  He's on the AM dial almost as low as you go.  Come on.  Pal Talk has bounced Doug out Doug from the chat room.  Everyone's bounced.  Of course they are.  Thank you, Dougie.  Thank you, Dougie.  Anything you say that's terrible, I'm sorry.  What's great is that...  Good luck, bro.  They came into our room, the Pal Talk admins, yesterday to remind us that it's a G-rated 
[02:22:30]  room.  And to not use obscenities.  Fuck them.  Fuck Mike North in his fuck hole.  Hey, that's what I say.  I like saying it.  Can I use it?  I don't have many things.  I'll toss you a couple of bucks.  I got to protect the things I got from the show.  Because I don't have many.  He can take a hike.  Fuck his mouth.  Or that, Jimmy.  That's why fuck him in his fuck hole is so much better.  But it's mine.  Fiddle sticks.  But it's mine.  I copyrighted it in everything.  All right.  I won't use it. 
[02:23:00]  T-shirt's coming from my brother, I'm sure.  He's a wet end.  He can get bent.  I don't care if the Pal Talk bosses think that it's a G-rated room and we can't go in  there.  If that guy's going to go on the air and bash us, we can go into his Pal Talk room and  say whatever we want.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  He's talking to his producer.  Why?  To get Mike on the phone.  Oh, to get him on the phone?  Travis flirting?  I'd rather our listeners just beat him up.  He ain't worth our fucking air time. 
[02:23:30]  Bastard.  Are they throwing people out just writing pro-O&A stuff?  We'll just curse on the air and get him thrown off.  We'll curse on the air and get him fined.  Well, you can't curse in the room.  How about...  Oh, no.  That wouldn't be allowed.  You can't curse in the room, but you could have anal sex.  So that makes sense.  Any jackers allowed?  Do we have anyone who wants to get on cam and jack in his room?  You want to jack, Jim?  I certainly do.  All right. 
[02:24:00]  Who haven't I jacked in front of you?  Oh, that'd be really fucking funny.  This idiot's talking and someone's just jacking off in his room.  Hey, somebody ought to go into some of the fucking adult rooms and, like, where they're  all jacking and say you should see all the girls licking pussy in this room or something  and then get all these fucking jackers to go into his room and stroke their delicious  uncut fucking suicide bombing cocks.  Mike North Morning Show on MySpace. 
[02:24:30]  Eric, you don't have to raise your hand.  You're a part of the show.  Mike North Morning Show on MySpace.  Shut up.  Have fun with that one.  Yes, useless.  We have an update.  At 9.40, he wants to talk to you live on both shows.  At 9.40, we're going to talk to a man out today.  At 9.40.  9.40.  9.40 a.m.  Is it 9.40 our time or their time?  It's Chicago.  Everyone's going in and raising their hand on us. 
[02:25:00]  Look at all the raising hands.  They all want to chip in.  They all want to say hi.  How come it's the audio?  Why is it not scrolling?  They're not allowing anybody to talk?  No, no one else can talk.  And they froze the text.  Oh, can they do that?  We're ruining his little pal talk show.  The pal talk experiment is bombing.  Yeah, and it should bomb.  I think we work for the same company, by the way.  Do we?  I don't give a shit.  Then he's a great guy.  No, stop. 
[02:25:30]  Fuck them.  Jason and Rye, faithful listener of the Opie and Anthony show.  Boy, do we all come together when we have to.  Yep.  And then we can go back to hating each other.  Exactly.  We'll hate you guys.  You'll hate members of the show.  But when we need each other, boy, we come together.  We're like the Irish.  We're like Irish brothers.  Irish brothers.  You beat the crap out of each other, but someone tries to beat one of you up, then you gang together.  That's it.  That's this show in a nutshell.  What's up, Jason? 
[02:26:00]  Hey, man.  There's a couple of guys downstairs from Canada.  We were wondering if there was any way we could come up and watch the show somewhere.  How many chicks are with them?  They got chicks?  No, it's not the best.  Ah, no, eh?  What part of Canada?  What part of Canada?  I don't know.  That's the other guys.  I was down here because I'm in town first.  Tell the Canadian guys if they will butt rub.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  A butt rub gets them in the studio.  Yep.  If they get their cocks out and jump up and down.  Is that too much?  What?  Is that?  Will you guys do the butt rub to get upstairs?  I don't know.  I spend it all.  No.  Hmm.  Wow, this is a weird one.  I'll read all the weird ones today.  Opie, you douche.  Who gives a shit if Mike North is utilizing fucking pal talk?  You fuckers attack North first for no reason.  Opie, you bring nothing to the O&A show with the exception of attacking defenseless people. 
[02:27:00]  I think that's a lie.  So you're saying Mike North is defenseless?  Huh?  What?  Thanks, Jimmy.  But I also do fuck them in their fuck holes.  But the attack was because he kind of claimed that he was like one of the first.  Yeah, he was bragging in the press about it.  That was the problem.  Wasn't he?  Of course he could use pal talk.  We would encourage other shows.  All right, hey, would you blow me?  Wow, I bet you that's what it says on your license.  Ew, hey, would you blow me?  From the school of John Minnelli, I guess. 
[02:27:30]  John Minnelli is your mentor.  Hide behind outrageous names that we used to say in third grade.  Type whatever the fuck you want.  Hey, would you blow me?  Sounds like, hey, would you blow me?  I know.  Oh, is that what the joke is on that?  That's what makes it so crazy.  I never understood that one.  That's what makes it so crazy.  It was just a wacky name.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's named Haywood?  I'm sure Mike Hunt is going to be instant feedback any minute now.  How come it's not scrolling in pal talk? 
[02:28:00]  How come pal talk's not scrolling?  I was going to read some of them for the listeners so they don't just hear us talking about pal talk.  No, they're frozen.  Jason, are they going to butt rub or what?  They said they'll do it.  With Jimmy, right?  No, with each other.  What am I, fruit?  With each other?  I love how people just assume that every butt rub has to happen with Jimmy.  It's got to be Jimmy.  Absolutely.  I mean, I understand that people want that.  Is my ass smooth and delicious?  I just love it, though. 
[02:28:30]  It's not even a hesitation.  With Jimmy, right?  Yeah.  You know, we all know.  He's the fruit that likes butt rubbing for real.  It's not for the radio.  No.  That was Opie talking.  Let's say hi to Doug out, Doug.  Doug.  Doug.  Hello, Douglas.  Do we love you or hate you today?  I don't know where we're at.  I don't know.  I can barely hear you, though.  Yeah, well, why would the phones work?  The sound's all fucked up.  Why would the phones work?  We've just been asking for a few days to get the volume up on the phones.  And, of course, Doug's going to keep talking because he can barely hear us. 
[02:29:00]  Because he's usually really good at this type of thing.  He never talks over us when we're trying to do our radio show.  Yeah.  Proving that XM still hasn't figured out the fucking phones.  Doug, what were you saying?  I said, thank you guys for the little on-air mention before about getting bounced from that room.  Yes.  Because about 20 seconds afterwards, I got banned from PalTalk completely.  Why?  I have no idea.  I got bounced from the O&A live room.  And then it said I was no longer allowed to join any groups. 
[02:29:30]  So I don't know if there's any other fans out there that were in the score room that got bounced and banned.  Well, they absolutely shouldn't be doing that.  Yeah, PalTalk's going to start, you know, do you think that Mike North is giving you more than the O&A show?  That room's got like 10 people in it until we raid it.  Hey, by the way, first of all, Mike Hunt's on Instant Feedback.  Did someone say my name?  And then Greg from Philly, hilarious.  And good idea leaving the calls to Mike North to the pass. 
[02:30:00]  Knowing you, you might wind up just talking about the White Sox pitching rotation woes before getting your shots in.  Yeah, true.  So what's going to happen there, Dougie?  How'd you get banned?  I can barely hear at all.  How did you get banned?  I have no idea.  About 20 seconds after you guys, I think you said it, Jimmy.  Yeah, the last thing I saw was that you got bounced out of the room, so I figured you said something. 
[02:30:30]  No, I actually was just sitting in there.  I think I plugged my website once.  Wow.  But, yeah, I got bounced from that room, and then I got bounced from the live room after you said it on the air, and then I was banned completely.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, that's the four red admins in there can do whatever they want.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I.P. Freely from New Jersey, uh, he's writing in.  I.P. Freely?  Uh, Opie, I think you're just dandy.  Ah.  Thank you, I.P.  What an odd name. 
[02:31:00]  I wonder what his initials are.  No, if it's a compliment, then they are using their real name.  Yes.  I figured that out a long time ago.  Irving Patrick?  Irving?  Freely, probably, something like that?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, okay.  Let's see, Chicken Shit from Albuquerque says, Opie sucks.  Chicken Shit?  Just a guy hiding.  But if it was Chicken Shit, Opie's great, then obviously his name really is Chicken Shit.  Oh, shit.  Sure.  All right, Doug.  Well, what are we going to do about this?  How do you get back in there?  I don't know this stuff. 
[02:31:30]  Doug?  I don't know.  We'll have to see what the red admins say.  They're never in our room.  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear anything.  Hey, this seems like the old days of XM when no one could hear anything.  Yeah.  You know, I don't blame XM for having crappy phones because, you know, they only found out  like two days ago that they were redoing our studio and we would be displaced for, you  know, a month, month and a half.  So I don't blame them.  It was a last minute thing that they realized they had to take care of. 
[02:32:00]  Ugh.  Ugh.  Yeah, that has to be fixed by tomorrow.  That's right.  Or one day.  Uh-huh.  Uh, yeah, sure.  How is our call going to go with Mike North if we can't hear, if he can't hear us?  It's good.  We're going to look silly. 
[02:32:30]  Bastards.  I got a wedding to go to today.  I'm all excited about.  Amanda.  Amanda Hug and Kiss from Wackbag.  Amanda Hug and Kiss?  I'm a fan of only you and I hear you were looking for me.  See, that's her real name because it's a compliment.  It's a him.  Amanda Hug and Kiss.  No, Amanda.  Amanda.  Amanda Hug and Kiss.  But if you're at a last name Hug and Kiss, why would you call your daughter Amanda?  Because, you know, their parents were hippies. 
[02:33:00]  Oh.  It's like a joke almost.  A joke name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are there red admins in our room?  Ivana Tinkle from FBA says, hey, leave Haywood alone.  I think his name is funny.  Uh-oh.  Gary from Pal Talk.  Get the fuck out of my room.  Get the fuck out of my room.  Can I bounce him?  Now, this is very...  Oh, I'm trying to use my bounce powers.  They don't work against the red admin. 
[02:33:30]  You do not have sufficient access to bounce the user.  Oh, my God.  He's like the Death Star.  Holy shit.  I can't bounce Gary.  These bastards has figured out a way to get to me still.  Ah, here we go.  Hold on.  I got it.  I got it.  Close room.  What?  Boom.  He's bounced.  You can't close our room.  No, now I'll reopen it.  Oh, all right.  By the way, these fucking...  There we go. 
[02:34:00]  Ant, too many things go wrong.  By the way, they figured it out.  They figured around my little scheme here.  I got a dilemma.  What?  Well, now we got a guy.  His name is Opie is a cunt.  And it has to be his real name because he says Opie is great.  So now what do I do?  Oh, man.  There's a guy out there whose real name is Opie is a cunt.  Cunt is great.  We all love cunt.  Who doesn't love cunt?  Get those hands up.  You fuckers.  You figured it out.  That's tough. 
[02:34:30]  Well, alcoholic.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Alcoholic.  Buster Hyman.  Love the show.  See?  Has to be his real name if it's a compliment.  Claude Balls.  Opie rules.  Claude Balls?  Yes.  Is that his name?  The Claude Balls.  Yes.  Barry McCockiner.  Opie, you're the greatest.  Barry?  Wait a minute.  Barry McCockiner?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  I've never heard of him.  It has to be his real name because he's giving a compliment to me.  I don't think so.  He says that Mike North said we're calling him because we must need some listeners.  Oh, don't even stop.  That one.  That old gag.  That old gag?  He's going with that old gag?  He's going with that old gag?  That is an old gag.  I'm not sure what we should talk to him about.  Let me see.  First thing.  What?  I'm not sure what we should say to him on the air, but I think we can handle it responsibly. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Where is he?  Doug?  Four minutes.  Four minutes?  Four minutes?  All right.  All right, Doug.  We're going to let you go because you can't really hear us.  Doug?  Yeah.  Dan in Pennsylvania.  Dan?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Dan.  Hey, I just want to say, you know, when you guys first went over to FM, you said, give  it a chance.  Give it a chance.  It's going to be great.  It's going to make the show better. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  But with the censorship getting worse and worse, I mean, you guys are afraid to talk about  anything nowadays.  Yep.  And now you're just goofing off on the XM show, not really doing anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it.  It was better back in the day.  I'm sorry, guys.  I love you.  Back in the day.  When is the day?  Yeah.  A lot of people like to say back in the day.  Oh, when we first came on XM.  Wow.  I disagree.  I think when we first came on XM, we were pretty well done and didn't really know what  we were doing.  Ah, right.  But if that's what you think, then so be it.  What can I tell you?  You're right. 
[02:36:30]  You know something?  Play that Carlin bit.  Play the Carlin House of Blues bit.  Like when we first came on XM for 20 minutes.  Remember those fucking comedy bits?  Jim Norton on Instant Feedback.  Yeah, they sucked.  I don't think Opia is funny at all, and I think they should promote that other sweet  boy in studio.  Now, see, this can't be Jim Norton because he...  I have a BlackBerry.  Did you really write that?  No.  I don't know how to fucking see the keys. 
[02:37:00]  Did you really write that?  Here's the dilemma with my BlackBerry.  Someone can help me.  All right.  We'll get to some business here.  Speaking of calling it in, listen to this radio wisdom coming up there, Dan.  I cannot see the keys.  I'm like an old man.  I bought the new BlackBerry yesterday because I figured it would get me laid.  A chick would see me with this.  And the fucking keys, I can't see them.  I can't see them.  How do you not see them?  You sound like an old man.  Because they have little...  I can't see them.  They're glowing little blue keys.  I can't see them. 
[02:37:30]  Where's Op going?  You might be colorblind.  He's got to take a...  No, no, no, I'm not.  Since we're just phoning it in, he decided he was just going to take a piss.  Since that gentleman that just called said we were just phoning in.  I'm waiting for the iPhone.  There's a good discussion because people...  PalTalk is upset with us because of something with them and CBS.  Really? 
[02:38:00]  Something that should be read verbatim on the...  Don't you understand?  Well, I want to say to PalTalk, don't you understand we're having fun?  It's fun.  It's fun to listen to Obi piss as...  It better not sting that much.  How much beverage does he have in the morning?  Room raids are hysterically fun.  And so what?  You got to take some time to bounce some shit out.  It's not like this guy had PalTalk last week. 
[02:38:30]  It's new to him.  Let him enjoy what it's like to get your room raided.  It happens.  PalTalk, lighten up a little bit.  Don't worry about it so much.  Don't take yourself seriously now.  We were all having fun, PalTalk.  It was all a big goof and everything.  Don't go thinking you're fucking Google.  Okay?  Relax.  Have some fun.  We have fun with PalTalk.  Don't make me get on the air and say 99% of the fucking rooms are full of Arabs jacking their fucking cocks. 
[02:39:00]  I know.  I just brought up something I enjoy personally.  That's right.  Don't worry about it.  By the way, speaking of Continental, which I always fly, how great is it that liquid shit was fucking trailing down the aisle?  Jimmy, I thought of you when I heard this story because Jimmy is a big proponent of Continental Airlines.  He has actually gotten all of us to book Continental all the time. 
[02:39:30]  Yes.  And whenever I hear something happen with Continental, I think of Jimmy and what he would do put in that situation.  Jimmy, you're flying.  Yes.  Raw fucking sewage from the bathrooms starts gushing and sloshing down the aisles.  That's right.  What do you do?  I take off my shoes and I dance like Scatman Crudders singing Minnie the Moocher.  I scat in it.  Scat in the scat.  Like, yeah, I take my feet.  I kind of do like the side shuffle like a shooby-dooby-doo. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay, we got to be clean.  Travis is calling Mike North now.  We got to be clean.  It says, okay, we got to be clean.  Okay.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Do we have him?  Talk loud because our phones are screwed up, remember?  Our phones are messed up.  They don't have to on that side, but we do.  Hello?  We got to talk loud.  Hello?  Hello?  You have a dumb phone?  Hello?  Yeah.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hi, Mike.  How are you? 
[02:40:30]  Uh-huh.  Hello?  Pal Talk's got to relax a little bit.  I agree.  Hello?  Don't get all uppity like it's the dot-com days.  Oh, a minute 30, Eric.  All right.  Hello?  It's a minute 30, Opie.  Hello?  How is that piss?  Hope you had a nice piss, Arnold.  That was a good one.  I got a tinkle, too.  But it's a minute 30.  Oh.  I'm up in just 60 seconds on the score.  60 seconds, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Now, first of all, we didn't say we invented Pal Talk. 
[02:41:00]  Hoo-hoo.  We utilize Pal Talk, and it's great.  Hoo-hoo.  A lot of fun.  And if other stations want to do it, that's fine, too.  It's not fine.  But.  It's not fine.  But.  It's not fine.  Don't put out a press release like your fucking George Washington Carver of Pal Talk.  Let's see.  Try to be diverse in my analogies.  Jimmy.  Wow, that was a fast one. 
[02:41:30]  How was your cock?  Jimmy, what happened?  You got shy, right?  What?  You got shy.  You got.  Oh.  Oh.  You got the, you know what shy?  Oh, oh, oh.  He's putting his cans on.  All right.  Da-da-da-da.  Yeah, I'm putting my cans on.  Eagerly awaiting.  Oh.  I forgot to put up the cameras of some of our listeners.  Morning show on the score.  842 weather on the score.  Mostly cloudy today. 
[02:42:00]  We could get some rain this afternoon.  Weather.  Especially later on this afternoon with some thunderstorms likely.  Highs in the upper 80s.  40% chance of rain tonight.  Lows mid-60s.  And another 40% chance of precipitation tomorrow.  Damn it.  Highs tomorrow about 80 degrees.  Currently at O'Hare.  73.  It's 74 at Midway.  And Mike also 74 at the lake.  Oh.  Casey looks beautiful.  We were going to try to get Opie and Anthony on.  We've been rebuffed by that.  But I will also say this about Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Wait.  Been rebuffed by.  And everything else.  See this is.  Oh.  Let's hear it.  They've been called worse just like I have. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, they have.  Come on.  I think they take pride in being called a tool by you.  I'm a hole.  What's up, Iraq?  Their management won't let us go on the phone because they don't think we can keep it clean.  So they said we've been rebuffed by them.  I'm a proud man.  They just lied and said that we've been rebuffed.  More of this.  Hammer and even.  I rarely hammer.  I just hammer.  You were hammer all over this land.  More of this phony radio crap.  We didn't rebuff them.  We're waiting right here.  We're waiting.  How do you think we're listening to the show?  We're on hold. 
[02:43:00]  You can't.  Yeah, we're listening to the show on hold.  How did we rebuff you?  You stupid fuck.  I'm so glad that we were able to, like, show them that these guys are just the phonies.  Yes, Stan?  Yeah.  By the way, Kobe Bryant.  You do a clean radio show for three hours a day.  We know how to keep it clean.  Looks like someone was scared of us.  Hold on.  Maybe the management can be convinced.  Maybe they don't.  Oh, he did it himself.  Yeah.  And he says, at the end, he says, hey, boy.  Can you monitor their force crap, please? 
[02:43:30]  We were rebuffed by them.  We're on hold.  Watch.  I'm now putting them on hold.  They said.  They're not.  God, these radio guys.  They're a bunch of fucking phony.  Oh, are they phony?  What?  Management's calling Travis right now to work it out so that they can put us on.  Well, at least we have our finest representative handling this.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, the first thing I'm going to say is, what was that we were rebuffed?  I was Steve to talk to.  Why did you lie to the audience right there? 
[02:44:00]  That's a great way to start off a conversation.  Oh, God.  This is what the video's about.  Guys could just go on the air and say whatever the fuck they want, and it's taken as fact.  We just caught the guy in a lie.  We're on hold waiting to go on the air with them, and he's saying that we rebuffed him?  We might have rebuffed him if we had something else to do on this side of the show.  Why do they have pal talk, I wonder?  It's not like he's showing his lovely hiney like Jimmy does. 
[02:44:30]  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, Jay.  Jay.  Hello.  What's up, Jay?  What's going on?  What's up, Jay?  What's going on?  Hello, hello.  I hear you, Jay.  Go, Jay.  All right.  Ready?  Jay.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Can you hear us?  Jay, can you hear us?  Yes, definitely.  Let's fucking talk.  Why aren't you talking? 
[02:45:00]  I'm talking into my fucking cell phone.  What is happening?  I'm not understanding your language.  Hello?  I want him dead.  Jay, I so want this guy to die.  I think he's funny.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jay, say what you want to say.  Yeah, what did you call for?  Go, go.  The show used to be better.  These guys had crazy fucking bands on there.  The Baseball Bad Challenge.  Fucking girls on the couch.  All kinds of crazy shit. 
[02:45:30]  Are you a member of that band?  Because he's talking about everything that happened on one show.  Yeah.  Jay, why don't you just say you're associated with that band?  Huh?  Why don't you just be honest and tell us how you're associated with that band?  I'm not associated with that band. 
[02:46:00]  You're lying.  Why?  How am I lying?  Because they haven't been on in two years.  And you're mentioning this like it happened eight minutes ago.  I drive around in a fucking sadder, prison prostitutes.  Oh, God.  See, I'm glad this guy doesn't like the show.  Thank you, Jay.  We don't like your show.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I'm here with my uncle.  I turned him on to your show and he absolutely loves it.  You got a new fan here.  We're going to keep spreading the virus. 
[02:46:30]  Right on.  What's his name?  Gary.  Let's talk to Gary.  Uncle Gary, go ahead.  How you doing?  I love your show.  What do you like about the show, Uncle Gary?  I think you guys...  Uncle Gary doesn't know the show very well.  Can we discuss Continental Airlines?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  You were talking about that.  Just the fact that...  Wait, I need a White Sox update, though.  Oh.  What's that, PalTalk?  I've got 48 other teams out there at Bradley.  Let me ask you a question. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know if you guys have even broached this.  I found out there's air conditioning in the dorms, by the way.  But do you know...  I have to bring my own sheet.  Do you know if you're going to be 1A, 2A, 3A, or 4A?  Because I think they're going to four divisions this year.  The most red pill mistake made, Indiana basketball now, is no longer relevant.  Oh, this is why I hate sports talk.  No, no.  I like that.  You want to keep going?  Yeah.  They're talking about how many divisions they're going to?  First year, you should have two classes, A and AA.  I'll continue to toot my horn on that.  This is a death now. 
[02:47:30]  It's wrong.  Basketball.  Do you know which one you guys are going to fit into?  You know what I love?  You're in your car going, yeah, that's what I think.  A and AA.  God, someone's finally saying that.  It should be two classes.  This is why I hate sports talk.  People won't know.  And I'm a sports fan.  He didn't want to toot his own horn.  There's some of the public league schools, I would think, aren't going to be the biggest  one.  Right.  Well...  And that can be because some of those schools don't have as many kids.  Right.  Exactly.  Well, you know, we'll see what happens.  By the way, Opie and Anthony, I understand, are listening to our show live. 
[02:48:00]  We wish them nothing but the best.  Oh, that's nice.  But I can't believe they're mad about me calling them a tool.  I've been called a million things.  We're not mad because you're called...  Oh, my God.  I love that he called us a tool.  I call myself a tool.  A lot of people...  A lot of people...  A lot of things work.  Well, how would have we been called?  Yeah, same thing.  I don't know, because no one knows you.  I love how these guys try to lump themselves into our success.  Wow, we've been called worse.  I don't even know your name.  You know ours.  I didn't know they called us tools. 
[02:48:30]  Good for them.  I really didn't know either.  You know what?  If we get them on, okay?  You know what?  Maybe we should get them on.  Maybe I'll talk management into doing it.  What do you think, Fred?  That's up to you.  Oh, God.  Should I go in there and state my case?  To be honest, if they join us, we'll be the first...  Because they're already talking to him.  I listen to them all the time.  Congratulations.  When they were on before.  I know.  They're on at night on TKG.  When they were first here in the market, they were on at night.  Yeah.  I used to listen to them. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  I was listening to White Sox baseball.  The St. Patrick's thing?  Uh-huh.  You know, the powers of persuasion to get two people to do that is pretty good.  You have to give them credit.  Oh.  Consensual Sex and Appeal?  Yeah.  It's St. Patty's.  I mean, that's pretty good.  That was a good bit.  That's a good radio.  It's always a good bit to get fired.  All right.  It's 849.  What the hell is that?  Great admiration for that.  And then you get fired and you go, what the hell did we do that bit for?  What if things blew up fast?  It's 849.  Oh, please. 
[02:49:30]  Please get us on the air.  This is like slapping around a third grade.  I think they like us.  I do, too.  I think they like us.  I do, too.  I don't think they have a problem with us at all.  Can I make a point?  And this could be wrong.  We, at times, overreact.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  We all, like, see what happened.  He might have said this.  Again, I didn't hear it.  But he might have said, yeah, we're one of the first shows in the area to use the thing.  He may not have avoided giving props. 
[02:50:00]  He may have actually said it.  Or he may have said it.  He said, because he didn't say we're the first.  I don't care about the top.  Oh, don't.  Why would we care?  I just think, let me tell you something.  Here's my whole take on it.  I think it's hysterically funny to have all of our dopey listeners plow into his room and screw with it.  It's just fun.  I don't know.  I don't even know his show.  But it shows he doesn't know fun.  Because if someone did that to us, we'd be laughing.  We'd laugh.  And then we'd be like, all right.  Trying to find him and goof back.  I don't care.  And then we would attack back.  That's how you do it.  But to get the pal talk administrators in there to freeze everyone out. 
[02:50:30]  I know.  Come on.  Have a little fun with it.  Have fun with it.  Stop talking about division double-A high school basketball.  Pop up some of the cameras and look at, like, people jerking.  It does seem like he likes the show, though.  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't get on there.  If it was a serious, like, this guy was being an asshole thing, that's one thing.  The guy's doing his show.  He does seem to not give a shit.  It doesn't seem like he doesn't like us. 
[02:51:00]  We don't care that he called us tools.  And tools.  I don't care about that.  That's a little hurt.  He's right.  We have been called a lot worse by our own program directors and ex-program directors.  And I don't know if it's a fact or not.  Bosses.  I may have done his show.  Current bosses.  Current bosses.  Past bosses.  I may have been on that show.  I don't know.  Really?  I honestly don't remember.  Do you know why I remember?  I remember, if it's the show I did, it's a while ago, and you get a cup.  Like, he gave out, like, a little packet of stuff.  Like, nice, like, cup and shirt and all this. 
[02:51:30]  Thanks for coming on.  I don't remember.  But as I'm seeing the logo, I'm like, did I have that cup in my...  Can I jump in?  Okay.  I just started laughing, because usually if you're a guest on our show, you pretty much  get beat up, yelled at, made to look awful, and then we make sure you...  You get a plug.  And you get a kick in the ass on the way out the door.  And a plug.  There you go.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  Get the bucket.  Beater.  He gives out little, like, gift bags.  If it's the guy I'm thinking of, he was very...  We just suck. 
[02:52:00]  If it's the guy I'm thinking of, I did his show.  He was very cool.  He was very supportive.  And he gave a nice thing when I left.  If that's the guy.  I don't remember.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  But as I don't know why it's sounding very familiar.  It's more the logo.  And I'm like, I think I remember that being on a...  Yeah.  ...up I have.  Well, maybe we should give out gift bags.  No.  Yeah.  With Erock's colon pieces.  We give a bag with a piece of Eric's colon.  No disrespect, Erock.  I think people would like that.  No disrespect.  They could chew it like it's calamari.  Oh, what a mess. 
[02:52:30]  Should we take a break?  I want to know if First Class had shit flooding through you.  Oh.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  If you're in coach and there's liquid shit passing you by, the shit feels as disgusted by  your presence as you do by it.  Okay.  But a First Class passenger...  Yes.  ...should not have to deal with...  I hope it happened on takeoff so the shit went naturally backwards.  I hope to God it didn't happen on the descent where the front of the cabin would have been  affected. 
[02:53:00]  The pilot constantly kept the nose of the plane a little up.  Yes.  Our altitude, 96,000 feet.  It keeps climbing.  You got to keep your nose up when there's shit in the area.  Keep your nose up.  You got to keep that nose up.  They had taken off from Amsterdam.  How awful is that?  You're there for like a week of prostitutes and having a great time and getting your ass eaten  and then you got to fly back to your fat wife and smell liquid shit the entire flight.  Liquid shit.  They actually flew and there was a problem with the bathroom and they landed in Ireland.  Yes.  Overnight to fix the plane. 
[02:53:30]  And then right when they took off, the bathrooms backed up again and they decided,  ah, the Atlantic, how wide is it really?  Here's what happened.  They made a...  I'm guaranteeing...  And this is what any airline would do.  Even my favorite airline, Continental.  They probably made a quick cost assessment.  Like, all right, do we send another 767...  Mm-hmm.  ...and fly this one back empty because we can't fix it here.  We don't have the facilities.  Or do we just deal with it and give them all vouchers and apologize?  And they probably said, fuck it.  I'd rather give everyone on this plane a free flight than waste a plane on a cross-country 
[02:54:00]  flight and then have this one go back empty.  Two planes at a commission, yeah.  Two 767s burning fuel with no passengers.  Mm-hmm.  That's me.  That's Jim the executive.  Wow.  Jim the executive.  I want to see you on that monitor next time I get on a Continental flight.  Hi, I'm Jim Norton.  Instead of...  ...National City Bank and National City, we want to make banking simpler and...  Instead of, uh, what's his name, uh, Larry Kellner, who's not the most charismatic guy  on film, I've got to say.  Larry Kellner may be a good executive, but he kind of twitches like Rodney a little bit. 
[02:54:30]  Like, if you watch on Continental, when you take off his hands, jump, they bounce until  he's like Continental Airlines and his mouth doesn't quite move properly for a man on camera.  He's nervous.  And he looks like Clint Howard.  Yes!  I think he's just nervous.  I'm sure he's a lovely man, but I've noticed that since he's been the CEO, they pan a lot  more to other crew members.  Yeah.  Like, doing anything.  We hear a...  As soon as he says, we hear, they pan to anybody but him.  Right.  We hear a Continental baggage handlers and people getting fired.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, Chris S. from Pennsylvania, when I was on your show, all I got, uh, was my feelings  heard.  Chris S., you can say shit here.  In the rain came in at five.  In the rain.  Not on the regular radio.  Oh, we're going on?  We might be on there.  In the rain from the beginning to the end.  Yeah.  I haven't.  I can't.  A couple times.  I mean...  And I will be honest.  I like this guy's voice.  I read the movies.  It's a wonderful...  This has got Chicago written all over it.  I gotta tell you.  It sounds like Chris Farley and Jim Belushi doing a radio show.  I do like the, uh...  Lawrence of Arabia, seven. 
[02:55:30]  Chicago.  Eight.  Vertigo, nine.  And The Wizard of Oz comes in at number ten.  Well, you know, his list was good, but I don't know.  No, it's not that good.  Here, here.  I got number ten.  Gone with the wind.  Right.  Number nine.  Let them do our show for us today.  This is interesting.  These weren't even in the top ten.  Uh, High Noon is number eight.  It's a wonderful...  Kevin from Connecticut.  The Mike Ditka show.  Yeah, it is.  Like...  Chris Farley.  Yeah.  Mike Ditka.  Mike.  They're so controversial because...  I hope people enjoy our continental break. 
[02:56:00]  Who would win in a fight between Ditka and a rhinoceros?  You gotta give it to Ditka.  Ditka!  That bit was great.  Uh, number three, Casablanca.  Number two, Rage and Bull.  Number one, The Godfather.  Citizen Kane's not in my top ten.  What?  Wow.  Fair enough.  Did you like Citizen Kane?  I've never seen the whole thing.  Oh, be clean.  Godfather is...  What?  We gotta be clean now.  He pops up.  The Rage and Bull was great.  I'm glad they finally gave that, uh, some, some marketability. 
[02:56:30]  Officials in Columbia, South Carolina believe a couple may have been having sex when they  fell naked to their deaths.  Hey.  The cab driver found...  You heard this.  You heard this.  You heard this.  I heard this story.  What else would they be doing?  Police say it looks like they dropped 50 feet...  Out of a pew, I think.  It looks like the bodies dropped 50 feet from the downtown building roof.  I think John Minnelli's whacking off somewhere right now.  All this current news.  Oh, sorry.  ...discovered not far away in a parking garage.  There were no signs of drugs or alcohol in the day.  Sorry, producer.  The Mike North Show.  It was kind of amazing.  They got in the flows of passion.  They passionately fell to their death. 
[02:57:00]  I know people that've fallen off beds and got hurt like that while they're having sex.  Can that ever happen to your friend?  No, talk about stupid.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta have...  Talk about dumpy.  We got Opie and Anthony.  That's what I like to do.  Talk about stupid.  Let's go to O&A.  It would be a perfect segue.  It really would.  It would have made us laugh.  It's like a stuntman.  When he falls, he falls into a big bag.  I think we're on...  The whole bedroom's a playground.  That's right.  I do like this guy's voice.  When he gets in the front door, you have to jump in.  They dropped us?  Are you not being dirty?  Because Opie said jerked off. 
[02:57:30]  No, don't blame it on me.  You did.  But did I apologize?  I'm blaming you.  I'm blaming you for getting us dropped  and blaming you for getting Minnelli fired.  That's right.  And...  Why did ya?  We're gonna get him on.  Top of the hour.  I would say...  Why not?  In a fight between Ditka...  I think he's getting us on at the top of the hour.  ...to see the White Sox take on the Chicago Cups  on Friday, June 22nd.  Brought to you by Murray's Discon.  All the stories top.  Top quote.  I like listening to this guy.  Guaranteed low prices by Windy City Limitine. 
[02:58:00]  We gotta drop him.  He's a 67 person.  Drop him?  Why?  Why do we have to drop him?  That's what Eric said.  Why?  I mean, I hope the meal on the flight wasn't stewed.  Eric, why do we have to drop him?  That's what I gotta say.  I'm gonna keep going back to this continental bit  because I'm not finished.  I got more to say about liquid shit  on a cross-Atlantic flight.  There's something about liquid duty  on a long flight in the rug.  It wasn't like they have linoleum floors  where you could just put a fucking tissue on your foot  and do the old scoochy-scooch.  These are rugs with liquid shit. 
[02:58:30]  The old scoochy-scooch.  We've all had a grandparent with cancer.  You know, they get nervous in the kitchen  while looking for a roll or a banana  or something that won't upset their stomach.  You gotta give the old scoochy-scooch  with a paper towel on your shoe.  And they have that look,  the horror look,  like, I couldn't help it.  Oh, it's okay.  Go to bed.  Yeah, go to bed.  And then you leave it on their leg  because they're old.  And then you throw the towel down  and you go scooch-scooch-scooch-scooch.  That must have just been a nightmare.  Dude, seven hours of liquid shit 
[02:59:00]  and how bad a bathroom smells on a plane?  Yeah.  I mean, I can barely eat my egg salad sandwich  when I'm in there.  Nothing?  That would get a big laugh from the whole crew.  I don't like this.  Stupid Pat Duffy is just happy to be in here  without puking his mouth.  All right.  All right.  I'm hungry.  I wouldn't mind eating something off air,  not on air.  Pat Duffy and his early, honest Abe beard.  Oh, that beard is awful.  Isn't it?  Yes.  What made you grow a beard like that?  Like, what's going on with that thing?  My dad, Duff, as you know, 
[02:59:30]  he shaved his beard off,  so I had to grow one.  That doesn't make any sense, I know.  No.  But there has to be a beard.  But why that style?  That's like an old,  either Amish was brought up yesterday  or old, honest Abe.  That style's coming back, yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  This is how it grows in.  My brother says it's a Joe Dirt beard.  It grows in all white trash like this.  He purposely went with that look.  Are we going on?  Yeah, in two and a half minutes.  Eric's gotten eight different times  he's given us.  Oh, I know.  Well, that's because somebody  always says something.  Don't get defensive. 
[03:00:00]  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you today?  I'm fine.  I hope you're going to feel better  at the stupid Minnelli bringing you down.  You guys have to understand  that a lot of fans forget  the good times that they hear on the radio.  Are you a first day back  with this stupid story  about Anthony's shower?  Yes.  How fantastic.  A little showering  with dear old dad.  Jimmy, it was amazing.  What about this?  I went to the virus show,  Jones Beach,  Friday night, 
[03:00:30]  I swear to God,  I've never had to do the time  in my life.  I just want to say,  Jimmy,  I've never, ever heard  a comedian in my life  master an audience  the way you did.  You are phenomenal.  Thanks, buddy.  There you go.  And the next show  is at Mohegan Sun  a week from Saturday.  Yes.  Take us through Ticketmaster.  You'll work forever, Jimmy.  You'll work to your 95  if you keep going.  Thanks, buddy.  I appreciate it.  I hope so.  One thing about stand-up  that I love  is you can always make a living.  I'm just hoping  that I get to the end of the year  before someone finds out  I'm a fraud.  Dude, I'm hoping  I make it till 39 on the radio. 
[03:01:00]  Fraud.  A 25-year fraud.  It's coming to an end.  No, it's not.  They're on to me.  It's not.  I'd like a three-bedroom  before it comes to an end.  Shh.  I don't want to come to an end.  I want to keep going.  Are we on yet?  Thank you.  Hi, Shepard.  Hi, this is Doug.  Where'd you buy your used car?  Stop it.  Working.  Oh, whoa.  Don't leave.  We're all answering the commercial.  This is Doug.  Hi, Doug.  Stop it.  So, you're on a flight  and all of a sudden  you just throw the bathroom back up. 
[03:01:30]  What happens?  Do the oxygen masks come down  so you don't have to breathe it in?  What do you do?  Do they serve the food  in those little handy wipes  so you can dab under your nose  like you're a coroner?  Well, apparently the stewardesses,  the flight attendants,  were wearing those masks  and things over their hair  and everything.  They were wearing  all kinds of protective gear  when they went up  and down the aisle  and they served food and drink  but they told the people  don't eat or drink too much.  Cup tickets in the 9 o'clock hour. 
[03:02:00]  Ooh.  Text messages at 67011.  They should have thrown themselves  on the rug  and sacrificed themselves.  Soaked it up with their clothes.  Oh.  Yes.  It is 9-0-2 on WSCR 670.

[03:02:30]  all low on the phone.  Sammy joining Aaron.  I bet we are.  You're going to be like,  we can't hear you.  Great.  We blame XR.  We blame XR.  Michael Barrett  traded to the San Diego Padres  along with $1.5 million  in exchange for switch hitting  catcher Rob Bowen  and minor league outfielder  Kyler Burke.  And now when he met the media  down in San Diego,  Barrett was asked  if he saw this one coming.  I don't know if it was  inevitable. 
[03:03:00]  I don't know if that was  the case.  But, you know,  like I said,  we'd started to play  better baseball over there.  Joey from Howard Beach.  I wasn't really sure  what was going on.  F-ing with you guys  and just keep telling you  you'll be on in two minutes.  That would be funny.  We've got to use that one.  When they told me  I was traded,  you know,  I know how this business works  and anything can happen.  Yes, it can.  So, Barrett,  now a member  of the San Diego Padres,  Ted Lilly,  goes to 105 this afternoon.  Final game  of the three-game set  in Texas.  Marlins beat the White Sox 
[03:03:30]  yesterday 5-4.  The Sox have now dropped  19 of 24 games.  John Garland,  the hard luck loser.  Paul Kanerko  at a home run set afterwards.  It's kind of hard  to forget about everything  that's happening  at the ballpark  when you actually  leave the park  and go home.  You get frustrated  by every little thing  that's going wrong right now.  You'll kill yourself.  I mean,  that's not as bad as it's going.  So, I mean,  you kind of have to disconnect  at some point  when you leave.  Was he a member  of the Opie and Anthony show?  Put a good on it.  He's working.  And, you know,  I'm going to go not  take it out on my family.  I mean,  you can't do that.  I mean,  that's just not the way 
[03:04:00]  it goes anymore.  You can't do that.  Maybe you're single.  I'm blessed this guy.  Five breaks in 20 minutes.  I don't know, man.  It's not fun.  I love Paulie.  It's not the way  it goes anymore.  Now, five years ago,  you could take it out  on the family.  But now,  you don't think  there's some domestic problems?  Nice.  With some of the families  of the white people.  Domestic violence reference.  Please.  Yeah.  I come home from  a softball game  that we should have won.  I'm aggravated.  Jerry Owen sent down.  Looks like Darren Ersted  will be activated.  Well, you know  what happened to Jerry Owen,  don't you?  You know why he got sent down?  Why?  He laid down a successful 
[03:04:30]  button,  moved the runners.  And right after that,  they couldn't wait  to send him out.  They go,  this will not be accepted here.  Did you remember that?  Yeah.  Now that you can button,  try and hit for some power.  Yeah.  You're the first guy  that's really laid down  a successful button a month.  We're sending you to Charlotte.  Pac-Man Jones faces  two felony coercion charges  from February Las Vegas shootings.  It's a sports show.  They have to do sports.  A strip joint  and have it rain 81,000.  Bad things are usually.

[03:05:00]  Nine.  The first eight were no.  No, was it?  No, I'm kidding.  She's a good girl.  Three quarters,  a dime,  and two pennies.  Apple Chevrolet  and Stanley Park.  Well, really,  four pennies.  That would make it any.  Rain and money.  Yep.  Yep.  That's what I like to do.  Math is tough, though.  It's horrible.  If you didn't get it  from Apple Chevrolet,  you paid too much for it.  You are listening  to the exclusive radio home  for the Chicago White Sox.  670, the score.  next broadcast Friday,  2.30.  Sox and the Cubs.  I'm Fred Huebner 
[03:05:30]  on 670, the score,  and 670, the score.com.  Tell them, Fred.  Oh, this is so appropriate.  Listen to this music.  Chariots of Fire.  They're on the beach  in their underwear  like they did  in Chariots of Fire.  We're pleased to have  The Mike North Morning Show.  Opie and Anthony,  what's up, gentlemen?  Hello, Mike North.  How are you?  How are you guys doing?  Very good.  Very good.  I've been listening  to your show,  watching you on Pal Talk. 
[03:06:00]  Uh, and, uh...  Yeah, Pal Talk.  They came and gave us  a demonstration.  I said,  this will never fly,  but apparently,  you guys,  now, I didn't say you were,  here's what I,  I thought we were the first,  but you guys  have had it for how long?  Ah, we don't care.  Like, maybe a week.  Honestly, in the end,  we don't care.  We've had it for a while.  We were just,  we were just trying  to goof off today.  And Mike,  we don't mind  that you called us tools.  We don't care about that.  Yeah, I don't want you guys,  you know,  because I heard you guys,  you listen,  I walked into the studio,  into the control room, 
[03:06:30]  and they said,  it sounds like a guy  that doesn't have fun.  Well, Ops, Ants,  come on.  You gotta know me.  I love to have a good time.  I've been listening to you,  I've been listening to you,  and I kind of liked  how you,  you beat around the bush  on the domestic violence  little joke there.  That was fun.  That's right up our alley.  Listen, you guys,  being out of New York,  basically,  you know that there hasn't been  a lot of domestic violence  with the Yankees  or the Mets,  because, you know,  quite frankly,  they're doing well right now,  but, you know,  during the war,  and they're all gay. 
[03:07:00]  I mean,  let's be honest about it,  you know,  but this Pal Talk thing  is new to me.  Yeah.  Well, we were trying  to welcome you  to Pal Talk  in our special way  by doing what's called  a room raid,  so we had all our people  go into your room  and show you  some horrific things today.  Well, you guys are  close to now.  Oh, yesterday, actually.  You're from Stern, right?  Yeah, absolutely,  because he invented it all.  See, we all know he invented...  Let me tell you something.  You two guys  mess with my Pal Talk anymore,  you will be abducted, 
[03:07:30]  taken to St. Patrick's Cathedral,  and mounted.  Do you understand me?  Oh, you better watch  what you say  about the church,  my friend.  We know.  We have to agree on this.  Is Alfonso Soriano  playing in Chicago?  Yes, he is.  Does he not look like  the guy that Kevin Dillon  brained with his rifle  in platoon?  You know what?  I haven't seen platoon  for a long time,  but I'm going to go  along with you on this.  You ever see a head  come apart like that?  He has big teeth,  like the guy  who got his head  caved in with a rifle butt. 
[03:08:00]  That's all I want  to say about sports.  Yes, sir.  All right, well,  let's talk about  what you guys do.  Let's talk about it.  Well, besides get in trouble.  Besides get in trouble.  Well, occasionally  that happens.  That kind of is  the stuff that makes  the news there, Mike.  You know,  but basically  we're just trying  to entertain, you know?  We got people  on Pal Talk.  How hard is it  for you guys?  Are you guys  starting to do  what a lot of people  are starting to do?  You try to keep  a stiff upper lip,  but do you find yourself  catching yourselves  a little bit? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  Still keeping it  out on the edge there.  But, you know,  who wants to talk  about that?  I want to inform you  a little bit more  about Pal Talk.  Yeah, talk about Pal Talk  because I'm a big fan.  I see you got a lot  of administrators in here.  Those are the red names.  Those are the people  that kick people  out of the room.  Oh, yeah.  I guess there's people  as I'm looking  at this thing, guys.  I'm looking at people  getting kicked out.  It says,  Bill,  Pell support.  We want everyone  to enjoy and have fun here. 
[03:09:00]  There's a G-rated room.  What happens  on that deal, guys?  Yeah, here's the first  thing you got to do.  Get those red administrators  out and get your room  an R rating at least.  That way,  you can watch  nude women  during your show.  I'm in.  And it works.  The only thing is  you need one person  that's there  to get rid of  the guys  that tend to come in.  And for some reason,  they're usually  Arab gentlemen.  They like coming in  and maybe not  centering the camera  on their face, 
[03:09:30]  if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  And then they harass  whatever girls  are in there  and try to show them  what they're packing.  Really?  Yeah.  So listen,  you're saying,  Mike,  if you want to see  an Arab man's penis,  this is what you've got to do.  Is this what you're telling me?  Exactly.  An Arab man's penis.  You will love it  on PalTalk.  No matter what  Gary and the rest  of the PalTalk admins  tell you,  it's all about 
[03:10:00]  guys hooking up  with girls  and spanking.  That's nice.  That's nice.  Welcome.  What do you guys prefer?  Spanking it yourself  and what can the girl  watch or having her do it?  I don't know.  Whatever makes her  cry fastest.  That was Oprah or Anthony,  but they were thinking  about what the response  was going to be.  That was a little  Jimmy Norton.  Well, not a proportion.  There's no question  about it.  Yes.  That's nothing.  All right.  Look, we got a show  to do, Mike,  and I'm sure you do too,  but I'm glad we were  able to get the air 
[03:10:30]  cleared here.  Good to talk to you  and for you coming in  the last time  I heard that,  you got a hat,  you got a t-shirt,  okay,  and a handgun  coming up,  all right?  Oh, nice.  That was you, though,  I think.  I did a radio show.  You sound really familiar  and I'm like,  I think that he gave  something out.  You do do that, right?  Oh, yeah.  I gave out some  chocolate sticks.  He didn't give out  anything.  All right.  Oh, is that not you?  Take it easy there.  All right, see you.  All right, Mike.  I swear to God,  I thought that was him. 
[03:11:00]  I'm an idiot.  You're confused, Jimmy.  I'm embarrassing the show.  You know, it's funny,  he goes,  Jimmy said he recognized  the background.  Oh, the after talk?  Yeah, the after talk.  They can take care  of two of the stations  of the crowd.  You can either lay down  flat on your face  and do what I tell you  or we can have Rocky  lay you down on your face  and then I will mount you.  I don't know where  he's going with this.  How's that?  You know?  Hey, they're not bad guys.  They don't seem like that.  See, you never get  to hear this part. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, they don't care.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  It's just radio.  They may be guys  that have been  in more trouble than me.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You know what?  And there are very few of you.  It's a very small fraternity.  There's not many left.  No.  There's not many left.  We're holding up.  It's you, Stern, O&A,  man cow.  How's he going?  I gotta go there.  Yeah, thank you.  If I'm in this company,  I want to shoot myself.  If I'm in the company  of those people.  Studio here in Chicago  because he's syndicated  in small.  I did a show in my room  for years and years.  Yeah, nobody ever heard it. 
[03:12:00]  Okay, he's goofing on man cow.  A new friend.  You know what I mean?  I don't think it was  his plan either.  Hello?  Yeah, very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Don't curse.  He's hung up on us.  She probably couldn't hear us.  She didn't talk or say anything.  We were listening in.  This is the stuff  you don't get to hear  after you hang up the phone.  People talking about you.  All right, we'll take a break  and we'll continue.  But I'm wondering,  did anybody get up  with their socks on?  Because a lot of times 
[03:12:30]  when I'm flying,  I take my shoes off.  Enough about the shitty plane.  No, no, I got it.  It was a 767.  They have a big first class.  Jimmy, I got the news story.  So yes, we will continue with this.  I don't want to be accused  of goofing off by listeners.  I want to get the story.  Is it the news story  with the blatant homosexual  saying his experience?  Yes.  We landed and I smelled that  so I checked the front  of my underpants. 
[03:13:00]  I still got it.  Even at 1013 when I want pretzels.  Look, track one says  passengers has to sit next to duty  on long flight.  Duty.  We got some good audio on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's ready.  It's ready.  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Why are we coming back 
[03:13:30]  with this song?  They know what's going on  over here?  That's funny.  Fire alarm went off  and you were in the pisser.  Just so people understand,  we're not at our  our XM studio.  They're rebuilding that.  Are we taking pictures  every day like we said?  Yep.  Are we posting the pictures?  Right now.  What?  What?  We have them.  We're gonna post them right now.  Alright, yeah, but  we're taking a picture  as they build us  a brand new studio  over there.  So we're over at  CBS still, whatever.  Yep.  At the K-Rock studios 
[03:14:00]  and fire alarm goes off  and I'm hearing reports  that Tom  pretty much ran out  of the building  with his entire staff  except us.  If that doesn't say.  Oh, really?  If that doesn't say a lot.  Did he run like  George Costanza?  Just knocking people over?  Old ladies?  Somebody ran in and said,  hey, you know,  the whole radio station  is emptying out  but they failed  to come in here  and tell us  maybe we should  leave the building.  So I'm assuming  we're alright.  Right?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I'd assume. 
[03:14:30]  Alright.  Hey, crazy story.  This has to be  the story of the day.  I gotta tell you.  This just coming in.  Toilets overflow  on transatlantic flight.  What?  Wow.  What happened?  Huh?  What airline?  Transatlantic.  I don't know.  Maybe continental?  Oh, as long as it  wasn't transgendered.  Wordplay jokes.  Always good.  Let's hear it. 
[03:15:00]  Alright, this is just  coming in.  I'm scared.  I have one button here.  If it turns on,  our careers are done.  Why is the tape  not over it?  I'm serious.  Why is the tape  not over it?  If we push this,  then we could talk  over the music  they're playing right now.  Wow, that would suck.  Why is the tape not over it?  What?  That would suck.  Can I just move  this thing to over here  and then I can't push it?  Oh, don't move anything.  Why not? 
[03:15:30]  I think that's...  You're screaming.  You need...  What?  What happened?  I think that'll just  put the station feed  on the show  instead of putting...  Oh.  That's what they're  playing on the...  Yeah.  Are we on regular radio  right now?  Yeah.  No, this board is not...  J-Rod.  Are you sure we're not  on regular radio right now?  What?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I love this song. 
[03:16:00]  Anthony used to sing  this song.  Oh, I love it.  I forgot the words.  92.3 K-Rock.  That's what they're  doing right now.  Yeah.  Sorry, John.  I sure hope we weren't  going out over...  Sorry, John.  Your beloved talk station  is now doing this.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Sorry, John.  Okay, I tell you. 
[03:16:30]  I am essential  to the music effort.  No, you're not.  Sorry, John.  All right, here's the...  Stop whining.  Here's the story of the day.  Hello?  What?  Hi, I'm on the radio.  Oh.  Who are you talking  to, Jimmy?  Who's Jimmy talking to?  Is that your girl?  Yeah, I'm on the radio.  Why would your girl call  when she knows it's...  She forgot.  No.  She forgot.  No way she forgot.  She did.  Because she even knows  that we're just calling in  on this stuff.  She's goofy.  What? 
[03:17:00]  She's sort of goofy.  Now you're on speakerphone.  What are you saying?  Oh, I was thinking...  I just woke up  so I sound crazy.  I was thinking,  you know, I forgot...  Oh, I can't talk.  Forgot we're not  suspended anymore?  Yeah, you forgot  that I'm not home  by 9.30 anymore?  We're doing an XM show?  Yeah.  You're being heard  in both countries  just so you don't  say anything silly.  Doesn't say much  for this effort  of the show  that even one  of the guy's  girlfriends...  Girlfriends.  She doesn't even  know we're on.  She forgot  that we're doing XM. 
[03:17:30]  Well, she just woke up.  It's hard to hear you  on my new BlackBerry.  Yeah, mine too.  I'm having fun with mine.  Hey, girlfriend!  I'll just call you.  Yeah.  Jimmy is driving us nuts  about his new BlackBerry  and I'm sure you heard  the same shit  last night over and over again.  The buttons are too small!  The buttons!  I can't see the numbers!  No, no, no.  Did you get the double key?  Like the two letters  to a key?  No, I got the new  fancy one  but the letters  have a blue light  behind them  and the light reflects 
[03:18:00]  off it.  I can't see.  I can't see, goddammit!  Oh, don't worry, girlfriend.  He'll drive you nuts  with that for the next  four hours  after he leaves here  like he did us today.  I don't know the buttons.  I can't see them.  Can you see this  over and over?  Baby, I didn't hear you.  What'd you say?  I heard about that yesterday.  I forgot already.  Oh, yeah.  I'll bring you up  to speed later.  There's a little scratch  on the screen.  There's so much more  to the point.  Oh, no.  You scratched the screen already?  Was it your car keys?  No, I didn't scratch.  It was actually...  You had a candlelight dinner. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Talk it out.  All right.  I'll talk to you later  because I'm going to start  saying very lovey things.  Aw.  Say something lovey and nice.  All right.  I miss you.  I miss you too.  Aw.  That's sweet.  What else?  I, uh...  I'm like the worst environment  for anything loving.  What else?  No, the guys will understand it.  Tell them about the anal thing.  I love, uh...  I love the time  we spend together.  What...  All right. 
[03:19:00]  I will let you...  What do you think  is the most fun thing  about the relationship?  Aw.  Are you fucking kidding?  No.  No, I want to know  like the things I love about you.  I love your smile.  I love how funny you are.  Um...  I love how I give you  a little hug in the morning  before I go.  Aw.  I do.  I give her a hug.  That's sweet.  She didn't stay with me last night  because she's apartment.  I love her tight body.  I like her tight body a lot.  Oh, boy, do I love her tight body.  But what do you...  And that nice ass of hers.  But what would you say  you love the most? 
[03:19:30]  I like how you wink it.  That's my bit!  Oh!  But he's brought it  to the girlfriend.  Absolutely.  I wrecked my personal life for it.  I'm right.  But that's my bit.  I don't have many.  Oh, is that funny?  Yeah.  I love you.  What do you do?  What does she do?  What do you do?  The wink thing?  What was she saying  before you rudely  hung up on her?  Uh-oh.  What do you do?  You don't want to know  the noise we make  sometimes when we kiss?  Yes, I do. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, no, you don't.  Now, it's the only thing  I want to know.  Yeah, this is fun fact Thursday.  Come on.  Fun fact Thursday.  We have a fun fact  about Jimmy Norton.  This would be a fun fact.  Yeah.  What do you do?  What noise do you make  when you kiss?  She started it.  It's a goof.  Of course it is.  Occasionally.  Yeah.  I like when you have  to preface things.  But she'll go,  meep, meep,  and I'll go,  meep, meep,  and we kiss.  Holy shit.  Yuck.  Oh, God.  But I'm not. 
[03:20:30]  It's not like that.  Oh, my God.  No one can even look at you.  Why?  Is it exactly like that?  Oh, yeah.  Meep, beep, beep.  No, not meep, beep.  What are we, faggots?  No.  I don't know what it was.  What's wrong with you?  Okay, do it again.  Let me see if I...  Meep, beep, beep, beep.  Yeah.  And we both do it  to the left and kiss.  Oh, my God.  What?  You've told some horrific  stories on this show,  but I can't look at you  for the first time.  We're nice people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Stop it.  Meep, beep.  Yeah.  You do that with your girl  and she's with you  and you both go, 
[03:21:00]  aww, and you kiss.  Oh, wow.  That's not during sex.  It's not like we're  in the middle of banging  and all of a sudden  I'm like,  meep, meep, you know, no.  Jimmy, you started a bit.  You hung up on her  before she could  answer your question.  So, of course,  the listeners will answer  the question for your girlfriend.  Uh-huh.  She loves your wallet the most.  That's from Philly Time  in the Philly.  Scott in Chicago writes,  uh,  ah.  He wrote, 
[03:21:30]  ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Doesn't it just feel loving?  No.  It does.  It feels silly to even do it.  Do it with your girl.  She'll do it with your girl.  You'll both kiss.  Ah.  Come on.  Ah.  Okay.  Here we go.  Scott from Chicago.  Uh, I did the wall one, right?  Oh!  I updated again.  Where'd it go? 
[03:22:00]  We give each other  the love bug  before I leave  in the morning.  All right.  What's that, Robert Reed?  It's the love bug.  What is it?  Okay.  Since we're confessing.  See, you take,  you know,  you know the Hawaiian thing  for, for love?  This little thing,  it's like the rock and roll horns.  The thing Dio does, yeah.  Yeah, yeah,  the Dio thing.  You do that. 
[03:22:30]  But, but,  the love bug  is you take that  and, and  she does the same thing  and then you hook  the two fingers  that are curled  onto your palm  together  and then wrap  the other fingers around.  And it's almost like  a loving little handshake  in the morning  as you kiss goodbye.  I go,  love bug.  Because it looks like  the two love bugs  are fucking.  Don't try to make it cool.  It's like trash fucking,  right boys? 
[03:23:00]  Hey, more people,  more people,  more people,  more people finishing,  finishing, uh,  Jimmy's girlfriend's,  uh, girlfriend's line  about what he likes about,  what she likes about Jimmy.  Uh,  I love how you let me  shit on your chest.  She doesn't.  The love bug is queer.  So Bobby wrote,  the love bug is queer.  It is not.  It, uh,  it's a little bit,  a little bit.  No.  A little bit.  Oh, fest. 
[03:23:30]  No, I can't.  Come on,  there's something.  Oh, I don't want to.  There's pet names  or something.  Come on.  No,  because I like our pets.  No,  we don't have a secret society  handshake,  fan.  It's not some kind  of secret society.  Yeah,  what is that fucking  love bug thing  that represents  Germany's domination  of Warsaw?  That's only when  we can touch.  I have another way  to salute her  when I leave it.  We're too far away  to touch.  All right,  let's just click pinkies.  That's Eagle's Nest.  Meet at the Eagle's Nest.  Yeah,  give us a little fun fact.  Yeah, 
[03:24:00]  come on.  Fun fact from  Opie's Love Life.  I don't want to.  Fun fact from  Opie's Love Life.  No.  You got meep meep  and love bug.  Now,  what do you got?  Come on.  You got something.  Every couple does.  Can I keep something  to myself?  No.  Why?  Come on.  You got something.  I know you do.  What is it?  What do you do?  Come on.  What do you do?  You're thinking of it 
[03:24:30]  right now.  Don't make me read  your mind.  I gotta read my mind.  Okay.  Ew.  You suck a homeless  guy's cock.  Together?  Idiot.  No,  just you.  What is something  we do together,  you idiot?  Let me think.  What could you possibly?  Don't give me  my pet name.  I don't even know  what it is.  What's your pet name?  That'd be good.  Do you know it,  then?  Yep.  You use it.  Got your show  prep for you. 
[03:25:00]  Insert pet name.  What?  Jimmy,  don't kiss me.  You have to do it,  though,  when you hear it.  He's a little trained  for it now.  Like,  we'll just do that  to each other.  Yeah.  Now,  what do you do?  Oh,  come on.  Little,  little something,  little insight.  Should I try to do that  to when I breathe  into her ear like a dog,  like joking?  I do that.  Hold it.  I do this.  I go,  I go,  but you gotta do this.  You go,  you gotta do like the big breath, 
[03:25:30]  how they do that.  No,  I don't turn it into a discovery  offshoot channel.  I do that.  I do it briefly.  Ripping me off.  No,  here's what I'll do that  because she had a dog  that she loved many years ago  and I'll just do that  to goof with her.  I'm not a creep.  And what she'll do,  my girlfriend will blow  on the side of my face  because that's how she would  get her dog to look at her  because she like  would fucking over love  and pester this poor animal  until it shot itself.  And now she'll go,  and like I look  and I go,  no,  no.  And she'll go,  and I look  and she kisses me.  Like she would do with the dog. 
[03:26:00]  Oh,  all right.  Do you ruin each other's yawns?  I do that.  Yes,  we put our cocks  into each other's mouth.  Sorry,  honey.  Yeah,  if my girlfriend's yawning  or if I'm yawning,  you know,  if she's yawning,  I'll just take my finger  and go,  and it ruins,  it ruins a nice yawn.  Where do you poke your finger?  Like right in her mouth.  I do that when she's crying.  I've done that at lakes.  Okay,  what do you do?  I like to show her 
[03:26:30]  extreme camel toe.  That isn't quite a  lovey-dovey,  but it makes everyone  laugh and laugh.  Oh,  you go for the laugh.  Well,  yeah,  but I have like special sweats  and stuff  that really makes  it look good.  Oh,  so you give yourself  a front wedgie.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  And what,  do you put your nuts  on either side?  Yeah,  I could do it  with my jeans probably.  Oh,  shit.  Go ahead,  do it.  Let's see,  I dare you.  Okay,  come on,  hold on.  The camera has to  turn around for this one.  All right,  if you turn around 
[03:27:00]  right there  and face that camera,  you've got a perfect,  don't get too close  to the console.  Just an extreme camel toe.  It's not going to look  as good with jeans.  It's not going to look  good at all.  It's your guy's nuts.  All right.  What,  what are you,  like an old impersonator?  You turn backwards?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What is that?  What is that?  Is that the old man thing?  No,  it's just...  Is that something else you do? 
[03:27:30]  I'm just warming up.  Okay.  You're pushing,  he's pushing his asshole out  like he's ready to scoot  on the carpet.  All right,  here he goes.  Wow,  that wedgie's coming  all the way in the back.  It's all the way up  his ass crack.  I told you those  were ass cheeks.  And now he's,  he's got a front,  I don't know,  he hasn't turned around yet  for the pal talk camera  or let me see.  Ew.  Oh,  God damn.  Ew.  Oh,  God,  get closer to the camera.  That's the grossest  set of balls  or the best cunt  I've ever seen. 
[03:28:00]  Oh,  God,  you got a complete  fucking camel toe.  Yeah,  go ahead.  Get that close.  Jesus.  Oh,  shit.  There we go.  I don't know how close  you can get it.  That's about it,  I guess.  Yeah,  get it a little.  Hold on,  hold on.  There it is.  It's camel toe.  There it is.  Oh,  wait,  where's your fucking sack?  Fucking Ope's all fall.  Oh,  God,  that is awful.  I got the pussy  that Jimmy likes.  Yeah,  that's what I'm saying, 
[03:28:30]  it's perfect.  Big and juicy.  It's lopsided.  Everyone make theirs.  Mine's good.  No.  Mine's good.  That looked like it hurt.  All right,  someone else try one.  Uh,  E-Rock.  E-Rock,  give yourself a fucking,  oh,  God.  Jimmy's,  Jimmy's cock's all the way  on the right.  It's just a big lump  hanging out.  You gotta hide the,  or you gotta use the...  Jimmy can't hide his junk.  That's hysterical.  Look,  face the camera.  Can you see the helmet?  You can see the helmet. 
[03:29:00]  That's your dick.  What the fuck's wrong with you,  man?  Jimmy's cock is all the way  to the right.  Anyone else want to do,  uh,  camel toe?  Eric?  E-Rock?  Pussy lips.  Gotta do it for the,  do it for the pal-toe camera.  Show us your pussy lips.  Gotta do it for the pal-toe camera.  Do it for the pal-toe camera,  you fuck.  Hey,  by the way,  it looks like my aunt,  my aunt has a vagina like Eric.  By the way,  where's hurt?  Yeah?  Josh from Philly.  Opie,  what do you mean,  look like an old man? 
[03:29:30]  Oh,  that hurts.  Ew,  E-Rock,  ew,  oh,  gosh,  ew.  Holy shit.  E-Rock's got some large testes.  They're just all pulled up,  bunched up.  Ugh.  All right,  who else?  Sam.  Sam.  Jesus,  Sam.  Camel-toe it.  Sam?  All right,  Sam is going to attempt the camera.  All right,  so get the pal-toe camera. 
[03:30:00]  I got dark jeans.  Sam's going to try,  but he's got dark jeans on.  Yeah,  hold on,  let me just pull that one.  Is that your fucking dick?  God almighty,  Sam's fucking packing 11.  I don't know.  Fuck this game.  Motherfucker.  He couldn't wait to do it.  That fucking stupid cock head.  Sam is all cock.  You understand?  That's annoying.  This game is all about  just kind of showing the boys  that you're packing  how big you're without getting naked. 
[03:30:30]  Let's,  enough about the cogs.  He's a white fan.  Thank God you're over six feet.  I'd shoot you.  Oh,  Sam,  all right,  Sam wants to do it.  Of course he does.  Sam,  get in front of the pal-toe camera.  I don't want to do it.  Well,  now you have to.  Much of men.  Pal talk,  and he's pulling up,  and,  That's awful.  Oh my God.  I don't think it's a penis.  It's anorexic.  What's that?  What was that?  What was that?  He's got a snatch. 
[03:31:00]  He's got a snatch.  That's good.  Well,  play along at home.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Feel free.  Toilets overflow  on transatlantic flight.  Oh,  brother,  on a long overseas plane flight,  you might expect a little turbulence,  maybe a mediocre meal.  But not shit.  How about sewage in the aisle?  How about it?  It happened inside a continental...  What?  What's up with that?  How?  How about it?  I love that shit.  Mmm.  How about it? 
[03:31:30]  How about it?  It happened inside a continental airline's Boeing jet  when the bathroom started acting up,  spilling waste into the passenger cabin.  It is a story new for you at 5.30.  King 5's Ray Lane joining us live in Seattle  with more, much more.  Ray?  Yeah.  Good afternoon to you.  Today, we caught up with a young man  from University Place near Tacoma  who was on board that plane flight,  and he says it was no place to be  at 34,000 feet.  I bet he liked the smell.  Even though there were earlier indications  during the flight  that there were some problems  with the lavatories, 
[03:32:00]  that the flight eventually continued  all the way to the east coast of the U.S.  He says everyone who was on board that flight  was absolutely miserable.  Oh, could you just imagine?  Absolutely miserable, huh?  Hey, this is coming in like crazy,  but I'll give it to Travis  because he was the first one from Kansas.  Yes, I do believe we have to do it.  What?  Camel Toe Thursday.  Oh.  It'll make the promo a little more interesting.  Camel Toe Thursday.  Now we got it.  A new edition.  What is Thursday?  Thursday's getting full.  How come? 
[03:32:30]  Some of the days aren't filling up.  It's just...  Thursday's really getting full.  Camel Toe Tuesday.  You can't.  You have to do the thing  when we do the thing.  It happened.  It happened on Thursday.  It's part of the rules.  It's in the rule book.  It happened.  It happened.  How about Break the Rules Thursday?  And then we put Camel Toe Tuesday?  Break the Rules Thursday  and then Camel Toe Tuesday.  He might have just overridden the rule  by making it Break the Rules Thursday.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  No, we can't do it.  We're nutty.  Break the Rules Thursday.  You did.  You pulled a fucking Captain Kirk there. 
[03:33:00]  This should be called  The Incorrigible and Anthony Show.  We're nutty.  If it's Break the Rules Thursday,  he can indeed dub it  No, we can't.  Camel Toe Tuesday.  It's unconventional.  We can't.  Bumper stickers.  Little camel toes all over town.  So far, Thursday is  Perv News Thursday.  Right.  Fun Fact Thursday.  We knew that.  Phone Call Thursday.  Still don't care.  How did that one get past us?  We must have been hung on that one.  Here's a new one.  Let's try Show Prep Friday. 
[03:33:30]  I have to add Camel Toe Thursday  because we might have to drop  Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Tuesday.  We'll just push it to Tuesday.  Until we come up with something better.  Some of these guys suggested for Tuesday.  Okay.  I got to overrule.  It has to be on the day we do the thing.  It's not Break the Rules Tuesday, though?  Or Thursday?  You could suggest it.  What?  Not if it's not going to change.  But Break the Rules Thursday  will ruin this bit.  And we need this bit.  Trust me.  All right. 
[03:34:00]  We need this bit to continue.  All right.  Camel Toe Thursday  has been added to the Thursday list.  All right.  What's tomorrow?  Mispronunciation Friday.  Yeah.  Point and Laugh Friday.  Which is my favorite.  Which E-Rock just gets pointed at all day long.  Well, last Friday,  we got pointed at.  Yes, we did.  And what else?  Isn't it also Air Guitar Friday?  Air Guitar Friday.  Air Guitar Friday.  Air Guitar Friday.  Someone is suggesting,  how about Good Show Monday?  All right.  Good Show Monday. 
[03:34:30]  We got beat up enough today.  Help us out a little bit, will you?  Even if you kind of like the show,  make believe you really like the show today.  We need that.  Fake it.  Our egos are a little damaged.  A little bruised.  All right.  More on the toilets over.  Is it now the guy being interviewed?  Yeah, this is what...  Who the fuck is doing their camel toe?  Oh, shit.  Oh, that was a chick.  That was cleavage.  No, go up again.  I didn't know.  I looked at the screen.  I really thought it was a guy.  I'm like, well, that was fucked up.  And then you sat back down.  Let's see.  Watch. 
[03:35:00]  That...  Oh, wow.  But that's what mine look like.  Oh, my...  Can we see it without the panties pulled through it?  My camel toe looks just like Deliver Us from Eva.  Wow.  We have the same...  Whoa.  Holy shit.  I don't have that.  Look at that mound.  That's sleased, Dacto.  That's sleased.  Wow.  I don't have that, though.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  More on the toilet.  Yeah.  This is the guy.  To be blatantly honest, I was more nervous than I had ever been on... 
[03:35:30]  Oh, my God.  That guy...  Sounds like Danny.  No, it doesn't.  Because it does.  This guy sounds a little effeminate, I would say.  Completely.  To be completely honest with you.  But just by reflex,  I buried my face into the carpeting.  Can I go out on a limb?  Yeah.  This guy...  I wish you would with a rope.  Sorry.  I don't want you hanging yourself.  Me neither.  So hard from a limb.  You're my friend.  This guy who's talking... 
[03:36:00]  Love's cock.  It's your professional opinion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear a little more from this gentleman.  I want to start over.  You could be one of those...  Actually, this guy who was talking, he meant me.  Oh.  Oh, this guy who's talking.  Yes.  It's me on the lawsuit, eh?  To be blatantly honest, I was more nervous than I had ever been on a flight.  When things started going wrong...  Gotta have the cock. 
[03:36:30]  To be a little more.  When things started going wrong, Colin Brock wondered just how bad the problem would get  on board the Continental Airline 767 he was flying.  He soon got his answer.  I've never felt so offended in my life.  I felt like I had been...  Like a pussy had fallen on the floor.  It was like a bunch of pussies had been sprinkled out like Reuben sandwiches to torture me. 
[03:37:00]  All I could think is, thank God, because it'll cover up the tuna fish sandwiches they've been  serving for a long time.  I've never been so insulted.  How is he insulted?  Like, what is insulting?  It's not an insult to have sewage sloshing in front of you.  It's annoying.  It's grotesque.  Dude, know what the best is?  Someone did mention this somewhere.  I would love to give them credit.  Someone that works for the railroads. 
[03:37:30]  And they said, this happens all the time.  Have you been on some of those old Long Island Railroad trains that are filled to the brim?  Yeah.  And then it starts, you know...  Sloshing out.  Sloshing out.  And then it's just rocking down the aisles, usually coming back from like a show at Madison Square Garden.  Who's the last person to use it when it's in that sloshing state?  You know they didn't shit out like 20 fucking pounds of shit and piss.  So they had to, what, sit there while it's probably touching their ass? 
[03:38:00]  It's unbelievable though, right?  Yeah, I've seen that happen on the LIRR a bunch.  Yeah.  It turns into like a shit river.  The worst is those troughs though.  You ever go to like a street fair or a flea market where they have the big piss trough?  Piss trough.  I'll piss in it, but I won't shit in it.  Dude.  Oh, well, you can't shit in it.  What's wrong with you?  The best bathroom story ever for me is spring break back in the day at Fort Lauderdale.  The Elbow Room, which is a legendary bar down there. 
[03:38:30]  Sure.  They even have like a webcam in there.  You can check out the place.  It's just a dive, but, you know, it was where the cheap beers were that night.  And everyone's drinking their faces off and you go in the bathroom.  There's no lights.  Pitch dark.  You don't know where the toilets are or the urinals.  And you're so fucking hammered.  And I lost my shoes like days prior.  My glasses.  No, I really did.  I had no shoes for days this particular year in spring break. 
[03:39:00]  So now you're standing in piss and just peeing.  Just on the floor?  I guess.  You could be peeing on someone's back.  You don't know.  It was completely pitch dark.  You had to feel your way around so you would feel a wall and then just unzip and go.  Only one runner-up line of the day today?  What about the rest?  Do we have the rest of that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, come on.  I felt like I had been physically abused and neglected. 
[03:39:30]  I was forced to sit next to human excrement for seven hours.  How do you think the guy next to you felt?  Wow, wow.  God, make up your own jokes at home.  I felt that neglected.  Neglected?  Neglected.  I think it was going back further than that flight.  A little bit of a, what, daddy didn't play with you enough?  Neglected.  I was forced to sit next to human excrement for seven hours. 
[03:40:00]  That's after lavatories in the middle of a transatlantic flight filled with passengers started spewing sewage.  It's on a flight with Voss.  Sickening.  It's a nauseating smell.  It's very uncomfortable.  Man-ass?  Oh, Wendy the Snapple girl's on Dr. Keith.  Dr. Keith?  Who the fuck is Dr. Keith?  I'm sure glad your two runs on Celebrity Fit Club did the job.  Holy crap.  She's as large as a house.  They gave her two shots on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[03:40:30]  Is that Blossom?  Yeah.  Oh, she needs some water.  Christ.  All right.  Now let's watch TV.  Let's watch TV Thursday.  Watch TV Thursday.  All right.  Now we're making it up.  Snapple lady.  Yeah.  Big as a house.  She was on Celebrity Fit Club twice.  And we had so much fun with her when she was doing the show.  Remember she started eating because her mommy had another kid?  Yes. 
[03:41:00]  That was her excuse for overeating.  And she didn't feel wanted anymore.  And loved as much.  And that's where she contributes her fatness to.  Yeah.  The fact that mommy decided to have another kid.  These are unexpected Hollywood...  Stars.  Stars doing what?  Talking about weight problems?  No.  Just being...  Being stars.  Salking.  Eating.  Drinking.  Salking.  Salking.  All right.  Let's get back to the flight.  Yeah.  The duty flight.  It was last Wednesday afternoon with his... 
[03:41:30]  You know what's funny?  It's an international flight.  It should have been duty free.  You couldn't wait to get that.  That's not fair.  I just thought of duty free.  I'm calling bullshit.  Who drops the load on the Long Island Railroad?  It's all piss.  Are you crazy?  Come on.  It's just people that can't help themselves and have to shit.  I've shit many a times on the Long Island Railroad. 
[03:42:00]  Come on, Chris and Huntington.  Help me out here.  It was last Wednesday afternoon when his flight left Amsterdam.  But roughly two hours into it, the passengers were told the lavatories were out of commission.  And an unplanned landing in Shannon, Ireland was made to fix the problem.  A pit stop became an overnight stay.  The next day, the same plane headed for its original destination of Newark, New Jersey.  But just after takeoff, the sewage overflow began.  This time, though, there was no turning around. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know how you can say a plane needs to be grounded one day for a problem that's not as major as a problem the next day.  He says there was one half-working restroom on the plane for the more than 200 people on board and that the flight attendants, even though they were serving meal service in a stinky, unappetizing cabin, told everyone not to eat or drink too much. 
[03:43:00]  Not too much.  That's just in case, you know.  You get that fucking E. coli.  Yeah.  That's when you, like, smear, like, a little bit of feces.  A little shit gets on your food.  Feces particles into your eyes.  Yeah.  Now you get it.  No.  Yeah.  You eat it.  No.  You, like, take a shit.  So now you get particles on your hand and then you rub your eye because it gets a little itchy.  It might do it. 
[03:43:30]  Or it goes right in your mouth.  It falls right in.  Like a Tootsie Roll.  I'm speaking for the common, man.  You're speaking for the freaks.  All right.  What?  Like a Tootsie Roll.  Tootsie Roll.  Only the good ones.  Mm.  Well, uh.  I thought I ever laid on my back one time while a Russian who I said I want solid and no suppository  fired a suppository onto my chest like a fucking, like it was a Kennedy assassination and then a glop of liquid shit.  I know that that's gross.  There's picture fucking a suppository bouncing off your chest and then stew hitting you. 
[03:44:00]  And then picture handing over 300, even though she said her name was Anastasia, but you could see by the picture it's not her.  You didn't use a suppository.  I did not.  She uncorked the stew bottle on New Year's Eve.  Oh, God.  Is that disgusting? 
[03:44:30]  You're telling me.  How should someone put a fucking chili in a sock and jumping on it?  Ah, there's your line of the day.  Line of the day.  Oh, shit.  Yes.  Oh, that is awful.  You are quite the card.  Passenger says it was the worst.  Personality.  Ah, two runner-ups, one winner for line of the day.  Ah.  Just got updated. 
[03:45:00]  Jesus.  Passenger says it was the worst flight experience ever.  Wow.  Well, there's a few.  I would beg to differ.  There's a few people, if they were still alive, would argue that.  Maybe plummeting into some...  The TWA plane that broke in half and it crashed.  Ah, why...  Maybe that's worse.  Why go any further than 9-11?  Yeah, how about those people?  Maybe that was the worst flight experience ever.  I think we can all agree that's the worst flight ever. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Worst flight ever.  No, it wasn't.  No?  No way.  Which one?  As horrific as 9-11 was, they didn't...  They all, until the very, very last...  Except for that one flight, probably until the last moment, I thought we might get out  of this.  That flight 800, I mean, you know, did break up at 13,000 feet, continued ascending to  about 17,000 feet with no cockpit.  The cockpit blew off.  It was gone.  And the wings are like, fuck you, we're okay.  Yeah.  And they kept going. 
[03:46:00]  Air Egypt was another horrifying one, which I heard fell backwards from...  Yeah, I heard that the engines got cut and the plane was plunging, plunging,  plunging, and as it got closer, the air pressure increases, or whatever happens to air pressure,  and the plane glided back up a little bit, but had no engine, so it glided back up, and  then peaked, and then just fell backwards.  And then the wings ripped off, because the pressure of falling that fast, the wings can't 
[03:46:30]  take it.  So you're falling backwards, and you hear the wings snap off.  Or a flight I had from Pittsburgh that was rather turbulent, and my dying Coke spilled.  Okay, now that's the most horrible flight ever.  Thanks for bringing us back, because I haven't breathed in the last two minutes.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Horrible story.  Well, I'm just saying, though.  It's like, you know, I didn't mean to be serious there, but...  That's all right.  Chris is still arguing with me with the taking a dump on the Long Island Railroad thing, saying 
[03:47:00]  you can't hold it in for 65 minutes.  No, sometimes you...  Sometimes, no.  You can't hold it in for one minute.  Dude, there's a burger place in Manhattan.  It's called, uh...  The Burger King?  Ah...  What?  Jackson Hole.  Jackson Hole.  Thank you, my pal.  And the only reason that I knew this was because I can...  You can concur, or whatever.  I concur with your findings.  I once ate a burger with my buddy Jay, and we... 
[03:47:30]  It was when I was staying in a hotel when we first came to New York after meeting in Boston,  and we went for lunch.  He came to visit us.  And so I said, hey, there's this burger joint I want to try, Jackson Hole.  They have, like, 200 different burgers you can get.  Any topping you can imagine is on there.  Captain Crunch Burger, sure.  I think they...  Whatever.  And I am not lying to you.  When I finished my final bite and swallowed, I was on a toilet with liquid explosive diarrhea 
[03:48:00]  no more than five minutes after I swallowed the last bite.  It went right through me.  Yeah, I was percolating.  There are times you cannot wait.  And it happened to you, too, right?  Yeah.  Oof.  These burgers go right...  They taste unbelievable, but they go right to you because there's so many different toppings.  You don't know.  You're just being silly, and next thing you know, you're throwing whipped cream on there  with limes and lemons. 
[03:48:30]  You don't care.  You're mixing up stuff that shouldn't be mixed up, and it goes right through you.  Best burger is for good farts.  And they don't go through.  They're delicious.  White Rose System in Edison, New Jersey.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Or Highland Park.  You ever eat them?  They're fucked.  We used to go there after we got high and stuff.  Yep.  Those burgers...  It makes me angry how good they are.  They're very fattening, of course, with these sloppy treats.  Mm-hmm.  But after your last swallow, all of a sudden you hear...  The type of fart you feel, like, in mid-chest, eating up your plumbing. 
[03:49:00]  The fucking thing.  Me and Florentine, speaking of shit on the flight, flew first class.  We both get upgraded on Continental, and I probably cut 75 to 80 gasters going to Vegas.  It was so bad.  Dumb Jim is in the bathroom, and I fucking dropped the hot, juicy one. 
[03:49:30]  And the fucking flight attendant went, ooh, and took a spritzer and went outside the bathroom  and went, ch-ch-ch.  She thought Florentine shit fumes were leaking through the door.  It was me in the first row.  That's great that you blame...  He took the blame.  But then another flight attendant walked by and got to our row and stopped, doubled back,  got the spritzer, and went, ch-ch-ch-ch at our row.  Do you understand?  I...  Probably 75 farts I cut.  I've never been happier in my life.  And everyone knew who was farting because there's an entire first class cabin, disgusted. 
[03:50:00]  I'm not exaggerating.  And there's two idiots holding up newspapers that are shaking with laughter.  I would be so pissed.  Dude.  First class, all nice, and you just stink the place up.  And we upgraded.  That was the beauty.  We paid nothing, and we're getting off the plane.  You know how you got to stand there and wait?  And I had a fucking Lulu Bruin.  I think I felt the start at the base of my neck. 
[03:50:30]  And it was warm, and it was going to be bad.  And Jim's like, you got to do it.  Go.  Your Florentine will just never discourage you.  Yeah.  But we were in line, and I knew if I farted, it was going to be putrescent.  And I knew I would laugh, and I was afraid that I would actually, I swear to God, I was  afraid I would lose my frequent flyer status.  That bad?  Over a fart?  I was afraid that they would say it was like, you know, whatever it was, you know,  Sighting a riot.  Disrupted or whatever on a plane.  I didn't know what they would say.  But it was, it's probably my finest moment. 
[03:51:00]  But I chickened out, and I'll never forgive myself.  Oh.  Jim's like, come on, man.  You got to do it.  Go.  Damn you.  Oh, that's, yeah, you should have just let it loose.  I know, I know, I will again.  All right.  Rise again.  You haven't heard the last of me.  Well, we're up to three runner-ups in one line of the day now.  All right.  A passenger says it's the worst flight experience ever.  But to be told that we were supposed to monitor what comes out the other end of us was insulting.  But for a long flight, that tested the strongest of constitutions. 
[03:51:30]  Shame on Continental.  It was the worst flight experience I have ever, ever had.  Colin says just yesterday, Continental told him that they're going to give him a $500 voucher for a future plane flight because of his inconveniences.  I'm not saying plane flight, you idiot.  He's not terrible ever.  It's the only kind of flight you can take.  It's a spaceship.  They're going to give you a $500 voucher to grab a bat's cock and have it haul you to wherever you're going. 
[03:52:00]  What else are they going to give you, a fucking kite or a spaceship?  They're going to put you on the shuttle and then kick you out over Albuquerque.  A plane flight.  A dirigible.  Perhaps a lighter-than-air ship.  And there you have it.  Yes, I have a wedding to go to.  I can't be standing around here or sitting or doing anything.  I have a wedding to go to.  Who's getting married?  Dave is getting married to the lovely Casey today. 
[03:52:30]  Very cool.  Down at the Hard Rock and I will be attending, witnessing the nuptials.  And I think they roped me into doing something.  I have no idea.  Oh, really?  I think I'm roped into doing...  Look at me.  I didn't either.  Look at you.  I'm still wearing my hat.  And look at you.  Look at me.  Look at me.  The raging bull.  I got it.  All right.  Why don't we do line of the day, then?  Line of the day.  Here's a runner-up line of the day. 
[03:53:00]  Uh-huh.  Is the board on?  Is the board on?  Yeah, the board's on.  I don't think it is.  What, this thing?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, you got it.  Oh, that.  I thought it came through this thing.  No, you goose.  I'm sorry.  Runner-up line of the day.  Okay, you got it.  Mike looks like every guy that was ever unjustly acquitted of a Klan attack.  Oh, shit.  No, he didn't. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, shit.  Should be enjoying that one.  Oh, shit.  Got it up for a no, he didn't.  Happy Juneteenth, too.  Here's another runner-up.  What?  I don't know.  Jerry Springer, I'm happy.  I cut off my legs.  She cut off her legs with a power saw.  Is that a she or a fucking he?  I don't know.  I paid that thing for head one.  But I think we might want the audio from this one.  Get this.  Look at those nubs dangling from a wheelchair. 
[03:54:00]  Two nubs just kind of rocking back and forth.  Is this one of those people?  I don't know.  I don't know what.  Is it one of those people that fucking has like a, is an amputee fetish person?  Holy shit.  That is fucked up.  I can just get the audio for that for tomorrow, I guess.  Oof.  I'm happy I cut off my legs.  This could be the greatest Jerry Springer ever.  With a power saw.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Really?  You're kidding.  It's close to an unpowered saw. 
[03:54:30]  What am I talking about?  Just sit there hacking away at it with a hacksaw.  Or a seesaw.  I can only use it at sea.  Excuse me.  Please hold.  Or if we're on terrestrial radio, it's a seesaw because it can only be used by a woman.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He gave her two shots on Celebrity Football.  Is that Blossom?  Yeah.  She needs some water. 
[03:55:00]  A late entry.  Yeah.  Why are they always late in the show?  A little late entry because we phoned it in for the rest of the show.  We try to come alive at the end so people walk away thinking they got something.  Yeah.  Next.  Would you like a corn chip?  No.  They remind me of nasty old people's toenails.  You ever see them?  They look like corn chips.  All thick and yellow and bumpy and curled. 
[03:55:30]  Yuck.  No thanks.  Fucking four days in a row we had to squeeze it in at the last second.  Oh, no.  Another runner-up.  Runner-up line of the day.  Oh, God.  Is that disgusting?  You're telling me.  Someone putting a fucking chili in a sock and jumping on it.  Yes.  Bravo.  That's a good one. 
[03:56:00]  In hindsight, it is.  When you're trying to jerk off and you've paid $300.  Oh, Jimmy.  You are never to blame.  It's time.  Wow.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  I'm getting yelled at by Happy Typing Girl on Pal Talk.  Why?  She's saying, get over here. 
[03:56:30]  I'm looking at the Happy Typing Girl camera, and they are at the Hard Rock back in the backstage  area.  I'm looking at the lovely Casey.  She looks beautiful.  What a beautiful bride.  All right, let's go.  And I got to get there.  We have interviews.  And bring your check.  Maybe she meant check.  Damn.  All right, here's your line of the day.  Line of the day.  Here comes.  Line of the day. 
[03:57:00]  Line of the day.  I knew it.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I love that he called us a tool.  I call myself a tool.  A lot of people, a lot of things work.  Why would have we been called?  Yeah, same thing.  I don't know, because no one knows you.  Darn.  Yeah.  Yeah, done.  There it is.  A rare victory.  That's a good one.  For the lobster.  All right, let's go home.  Yeah, I got to go. 
[03:57:30]  Looking at camel toes, pierced nips.  What the hell's going on?  What kind of wedding is this going to be?  I committed.  All right.  There we go.  All right, I'm on my way.  I'm on my way.  Meep, meep.  Meep, meep.  Love bug.  All right, there we go.  Everything's shut off.  I got to go.  I'm going.  The pictures of the construction of our new studio are up on our website, and you're  going to be updating those pictures every day.  For what?  For our childhood virus show. 
[03:58:00]  Yep, for what is it?  We have to.  We have to do it.  Will you get them on the phone?  Opie can't do that by himself.  Oh, why?  I do a lot of things by myself.  What?  What?  What?  All right, let's go.  We got shit to do.  Just fuck.  Stay tuned for the Eastside Dave Casey wedding with Ron and Fez at noon.  The virus is spreading. </pre>
