<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion about the firing of Dallas DJs Kramer and Twitch for a false celebrity death report, mirroring Opie and Anthony's own past firing for a similar prank.  They boast about their upcoming syndication deal with Infinity Broadcasting and their New York Times feature.  The hosts discuss their nicknames, with Opie explaining the origin of his.  Jim Norton is present in the studio.

A caller recounts a negative experience with his girlfriend stemming from a racially insensitive remark. This leads to a frank and often offensive discussion about the hosts' preference for lighter-skinned Black women, sparking heated debate with several listeners who challenge their views.  This segment includes highly inflammatory and racially charged statements from callers, including L.L., who uses derogatory terms.  Tracy, another caller, offers a counter-argument, highlighting the complexities of intra-racial dynamics beyond simply skin tone.

The show launches a "Moms I'd Like to F" contest with a substantial prize, immediately followed by calls and submissions.  A woman and her daughter come to the studio to participate, prompting sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  The "What's in My Pants" game is played with a female caller claiming to be naked, and a caller pretending to be LL Cool J participates in the discussion and the game.  Throughout the show, commercials for Pinnacle Horny Goatweed and Paisano's restaurant are aired.

The show then shifts to a segment focused on explicit songs about sexual acts, often cut short due to censorship.  Listeners call in, some agreeing, others vehemently disagreeing. A heated exchange with a caller, Rachel, ensues, with accusations of imitating Howard Stern and escalating into a vulgar insult exchange. The hosts read listener-submitted "guy code" rules and discuss bathroom etiquette, dating, and friendship, with a caller sharing an unusual urinal encounter.  Further calls from Mendy and Deb the Dyke contribute to the banter. The "Moms I'd Like to F" contest continues, with photos of contestant Allison to be posted online.  The racial preferences discussion is revisited, with caller Vanjie challenging the hosts.  A song about divorce, submitted by a caller, is played.  Sponsors including Rockaway Bedding and Pinnacle Horny Goatweed are mentioned.

The broadcast continues with a discussion about an experiment showing alleged racial bias in NYC taxi pickups, referencing Reverend Al Sharpton. Reverend Sharpton himself then appears as a guest, expressing his anger about the issue. The conversation turns vulgar and sexually charged, focusing on jokes about breasts, with sexually suggestive comments directed at a female guest and her daughter who are in the studio.  A commercial for "Ultimate V" is aired, followed by an introduction of the sister of the Ram Jam lead singer, who becomes the target of further crude jokes. A "What Did We Learn" segment features callers sharing offensive and sexually explicit comments and jokes.  The segment ends with more sexually suggestive comments about the female guests.  The show concludes with a Park Central Hotel promotion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony.  Proving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us. Have a drink. I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys that drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball bat.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Greetings. Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Anthony, the virus spreads to Dallas today.  Yes. Yes.  Hello, Dallas.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony family.  We call this a family.  It's family radio.  Good for everybody.  We are now heard in New York.  Philadelphia.  We love Philly.  Love you guys down there.  They're finally starting to get it.  Yeah.  Chicago.  Right.  And now Dallas. 
[00:01:00]  Dallas, Texas.  Dallas.  You ever been through Texas, Opie?  Never been there, Anthony.  Nice.  I'm going to have to visit one of these days.  Been down there?  Yeah.  Sure.  Hot.  I like it.  It's hot.  Texas hot.  Right.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Dallas was in the news recently as far as radio goes.  Yeah.  Couple DJs.  What?  Kramer and Twitch.  Right.  Got fired. 
[00:01:30]  Oops.  What did they do?  That was so bad.  Stupid DJs.  What did these two do that was so bad that warranted them getting fired?  Well, they did something that was very familiar to us, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Reporting someone's death.  Hey, that's a great way to get you fired.  We did it.  But you got to learn how to land on your feet before you do something like that.  Worked well for us.  We knew we were going to be okay.  Right.  Kramer and Twitch didn't really think it through. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, everyone knows what we did.  We said the mayor of Boston died in a horrific car accident for April Fool's.  April Fool's 19, what?  Ninety-  Ninety-eight.  Ninety-eight.  Been three years.  Wow.  And a few months.  And he's still alive.  And a week later, we were fired.  Out-fired.  Out-and-see.  Yeah, they pulled the rug out from under us there, but hell.  And then, I don't know, like three weeks later, we were hired in New York.  So it worked out in our favor.  And, you know, so much time has passed. 
[00:02:30]  I might as well just say, yeah, we were talking to N.E.W. before we got fired.  All right.  There.  It's out.  Enough time's passed.  You ever hanging out with your parents or something years and years later, and you go,  hey, remember that time?  It was heroin that you found.  Yeah.  Oh, you wacky kid.  You know, so, you know, yeah, we had had a meeting.  Wow, that's an exclusive.  But we didn't commit to anything, and we couldn't, because we were a game for a game.  You were awfully employed.  You bastard.  I was saving that for the book.  That was going to be the untold story.  One of the untold things. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we planned the whole thing in Boston.  Planned.  Now, unfortunately, I can't go that far and say we planned it.  That would be brilliant.  God knows anything brilliant could have nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  But Kramer and Twitch in Dallas, they decided to tell everyone that, what, Brittany and Justin  were in a horrific car accident.  Who were you more upset about when you heard Opie?  Was it Justin or Brittany?  And either one or both died.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And now they're fired. 
[00:03:30]  Fired.  Fired.  Fired.  Fired.  You get great publicity like that, and the station lets you go.  And because of those two idiots, everyone wanted to interview us.  Yeah.  And we said no to all interviews.  Remember another DJ pair who did the fake Jeff bit went on to go to New York City.  I wonder where they'll end up.  I think they're doing the morning show here.  No.  Are they going to be the new sports guys?  No, Anthony.  They will not be hired here at WNW New York. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  I am the assistant program director, and I will make sure that does not happen.  Figurehead title, if there ever was one.  Sure it is.  It's like those movies where they make the doofy guy the head of the company, but everyone  else runs it.  And then in the end, he prevails.  We didn't tell anyone that I'm now assistant program director here in New York.  Opie, assistant program director.  Had to be in the deal, or it wasn't going through.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  If I'm going to be blamed for people's firings and hirings and this and that, I might as well 
[00:04:30]  have a title.  I'm head custodial engineer.  So when people take out the garbage, I overlook the whole thing.  Yeah, we were trying to find a title for you.  I didn't want one.  You think I want to be in one more goddamn meeting that I have to be in?  I think it's fun because now, you know something, going to come a time, you're going to have  to go to one more meeting just because of your title.  And I'm like, I can't even bother with the ones I got to deal with now.  I think it's fun sitting in with Ken Stevens. 
[00:05:00]  Holy Jesus.  Oh, look at this.  What?  We made the New York Times today.  What did we do?  Did we kill someone off again?  A new breed of trash talkers on the radio.  Trash?  I think Ken Stevens was quoted in this one.  The announcement in early June that...  I'm reading this for the first time.  It's a short article.  Should I just read it?  Yeah.  All right.  The announcement in early June that Greg Hughes, who is known as Opie, and Anthony Cumia...  That's your name?  Holy Jesus. 
[00:05:30]  Finally.  I love how reporters have to throw that in there like they have a scoop.  Look, here's a scoop.  See, his real name is not Opie.  What?  It's really Greg Hughes.  Greg Hughes?  I've been Opie since I was 12.  I'm not happy about it.  It's not a radio name.  It just popped up when you were a kid.  I'm stuck with it.  Those kid nicknames, boy.  They follow you through life.  Good thing you're not pukey, though, or something like that.  No, they wanted to call me Howdy Doody.  Oh.  I vetoed the Howdy Doody.  You got a choice, though? 
[00:06:00]  Most people don't get choices.  They gave me three.  It was a girl named Julie Burson.  We got to get her on the radio eventually.  She gave you...  She's responsible?  She noticed it was like seventh grade that I was the only one that didn't have a nickname.  Yeah.  So, like, in the middle of math class, they're deciding what my name's going to be.  Correct.  And it was either going to be Will Robinson...  Will Robinson.  Oh, dear.  I wish it was.  Wow.  Yes, hairless boys.  I love it.  Wow, dear.  It was either going to be Will Robinson.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  Four eyes, because I wore glasses before my laser eye surgery, thanks to Dr. Philotoff here  in New York.  Smudge those glasses up for you, young boy.  So, Will Robinson, four eyes, Howdy Doody, and Opie.  And Opie.  Oh, my God.  What a decision to make.  Yeah, it wasn't a great decision.  Hmm, four eyes.  Okay.  I could live with that for a week until I get bludgeoned in the playground.  So, I decided on Opie, because they did give me that choice. 
[00:07:00]  That's very kind of them.  Yeah.  Because I tell you one thing.  I would not sit here on the Howdy Doody and Anthony show if you effing paid me.  Oh, like...  I would not sit here on the Howdy Doody and Anthony show.  Oh, like, Opie's so much cooler.  Better than Howdy Doody and Anthony.  You know, four eyes and Anthony, maybe.  The sad part is I wanted to get rid of Opie.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden, the radio career started going well, especially when you and I hooked  up.  And now I can't change it.  I can't change it.  Because that's what we're known as.  It's over now.  Will Robinson and Anthony show?  I don't know. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, yes, oh dear.  Get in the chariot, young William.  We'll examine the planet.  Did you ever have a nickname?  No.  Never?  It's just been Ant, Anthony, Ant.  Nothing.  Come on.  Even an embarrassing one?  No.  For a year or so, and then people forgot?  Never.  No nickname?  No nickname ever.  I'd be straight with you.  I just never remember having a nickname.  The stoned guy in the back hall, but never really stuck. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  So you want, all right, let's read this from the New York Times today.  A new breed of trash talkers on the radio.  The announcement in early June that Greg Hughes, who is known as Opie and Anthony Cumia of WNAW  in New York, had signed a syndication deal with their station, station's parent company,  Infinity Broadcasting, was far from the most shocking item ever heard on their four-hour  Opie and Anthony afternoon show.  Shocking.  That prize would have to belong to the sex jokes, profanity, or insulting of public figures  that make up their show's regular fare. 
[00:08:30]  Is that it?  It's all we do?  But the three-year deal, Infinity Refuses Discussed Salaries, will bring them to at least  20 major markets.  Such figures are the next generation of shock jocks.  Oh, really?  We're the next generation of shock jocks.  Good thing we snuck in.  Basing their shows in large part on the success of Howard Stern, whose K-Rock morning show  has been syndicated since 1986.  That's right, Robin.  These new shock jocks are part of a well-established trend.  Opie, Anthony, it's Howard. 
[00:09:00]  Do you want to come to Nobu for some sea breezes?  All right.  I'll leave a message.  You there?  Pick up.  Pick up, Opie, Anthony.  You're the new generation.  Leo, let's get some sea breezes.  Down at Nobu.  Well, might as well.  Sure, why not?  Okay.  The new generation takes the lack of inhibitions further. 
[00:09:30]  Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cumia...  Mr. I like that.  Respect.  ...had their start at WAF in Boston, from which they were fired in 1998 after...  Why?  After publicizing a false report about the death of Mayor Thomas M. Menino.  How can they say publicizing?  When...  Read that again.  After publicizing...  Yeah, we're fired in 1998 after publicizing a false report about the death of Mayor Thomas M. Menino.  That makes it sound like we didn't make it up.  We just publicized the false event.  No, we made up the false event.  And then publicized it. 
[00:10:00]  Very well, I guess.  Because a few people bought it.  You know what, though?  There was someone on the grassy knoll.  Ah, yes.  Who is safe to this day.  Who never got in trouble.  Ed and I lost our jobs.  We worked out in our favor.  But there was a third guy.  A third party that, if you listen to the tape of the show that we did, that we got fired for,  Opie and Anthony killed the mayor of Boston,  there's a third voice.  The voice of a newscaster.  A newscaster.  That brought the whole prank together. 
[00:10:30]  It really wouldn't have had that realistic feel if it wasn't for the third voice.  Because you probably have figured out that Anthony and I do not have radio voices.  No, it's not like that.  We needed a radio voice.  A guy that just had that, you know, ballsy, low, news voice.  Yeah, a little authority in his voice.  Right.  So, uh...  Can still be heard in the New York market.  Yeah.  That's all we should say.  That's it.  Because the poor guy, you know, he's a family man with kids. 
[00:11:00]  And he's been sweating it ever since we got fired.  It's like that 20-year-old murder that they catch you for.  I thought I got away with it.  But there's a little trivia for you.  Yeah.  In the New York market, you could hear this guy.  Mm-hmm.  And he never, ever got interviewed over the prank.  Nope.  Never got in trouble.  We shut up about it.  And they asked us, everyone that was involved.  They wanted to know everyone that was involved every step of the way.  And, uh, we never ratted.  He skated.  Totally.  And if he wasn't a good friend of mine, I would...  I would tell you who it is today. 
[00:11:30]  So you better be nice.  All right.  We'll let that out of the bag.  So they were fired in 1998 after publicizing a false report about the death of Mayor Thomas M. Menino.  All right.  Yes, it was John Montone.  No, it wasn't John Montone.  That earned them a berth at WNEW.  The syndication deal has put them ahead of such competitors as, ugh, Eric Muller of WKQX in Chicago,  who is known as Man Douche.  Right.  And Todd Clem, a.k.a. Bubba the Love Sponge of the Clear Channel-owned WXTB in Tampa. 
[00:12:00]  What about me, the Greaseman?  Uh, Greas, you didn't make this article.  I didn't make it there.  But I'm selling my butt off trying to pay for the airtime I'm buying on various radio stations to broadcast the Greaseman show.  No, you didn't make it.  What a doodle.  Who also pushed their envelope with pranks and trash talk.  Mr. Clem, whose morning show is carried on WXTB's sister stations in Jacksonville and West Palm Beach,  faces animal cruelty charges for the February 27th castration and killing of a boar for a promotional roadkill barbecue. 
[00:12:30]  Are you ready, Clem?  Jesus Christ.  What the hell is that about?  There's nothing clever about that.  No, just.  We're pretty twisted and pretty demented, but we try to be clever with what we do.  We'd rather castrate some of the people that work on this show.  Yeah, we explained that in our 2020 downtown interview.  Oh, Jesus.  That's airing sometime in July.  Whore.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, the trend shows no sign of abating.  So far, there's been no negative audience backlash, said Paul Hine, executive editor of the trade publication Friday Morning Quarterback, 
[00:13:00]  who adds they generate a significant amount of revenue.  We do?  I guess.  Sean Ross, editor of Airplay Minor, another trade publication, agrees.  In five years, if somebody comes along to obsolete Opie and Anthony, they'll probably be outrageous as well.  That's all?  That's all this is?  That's the article.  But it's in the Times, Opie.  Look at that.  We made the Times.  No quote from Ken Stevens? 
[00:13:30]  Uh, remember Ken came to us?  He was all nervous that the Times was going to interview him.  Ken is our boss here in New York.  What should I say?  We gave him some good quotes, but they didn't print any of them.  He probably screwed it up on the way from our office to the telephone.  I'll just call Melissa.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, Hope Anthony, how you doing?  Doing well.  Excellent, excellent.  I'm down here in the Philadelphia market.  I wish you guys a lot of luck.  Everybody's really excited.  Oh, thank you.  I gotta ask you, though, what are you guys doing out in Dallas? 
[00:14:00]  I mean, what are your expectations?  I mean, those guys drive around on horses.  They don't even have stereo.  Drive around on horses.  Great, great.  They don't drive around?  You don't, first of all, you don't drive a horse, you ride it, jackass.  And I think they're caught up with technology and have the automobile.  So I wouldn't worry about it, Jim.  I think our expectations are to get a better shift on this radio station.  Nice, nice.  No, I'm serious.  We're being heard from 10 at night to 2 in the morning. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, is that when we're on in Dallas?  No problem getting an audience when you're on that late at night.  Yeah, that is a little tough.  Do you think they're just going to try out for a little while or what?  No, they've committed to the show, and we'll see what happens.  Excellent, excellent.  Well, I wish you guys a lot of luck.  All right, man.  All right, take care.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike, who's very mad, Anthony.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's happening?  Hey, why are you guys cracking on Howard?  Who cracked on Howard?  You did.  What do we do to crack on Howard? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, come on now.  The Howard phone call, Anthony.  Oh, that wasn't all in good fun there, Mike.  What's the matter?  You can't have fun?  Well, you know.  Mike, don't worry.  Mike, hold on a second.  No, because I'm not going to listen to it.  You should kiss Howard's ass.  I think that you have a little bit of respect, because I...  Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike, shut the F up, you idiot.  Why?  Shut the F up.  Shut the F up?  That old gag, we should kiss Howard's ass.  Shut the F up. 
[00:15:30]  We have said everything we're going to say about Howard.  We said we grew up listening to him, and we respect what he has done.  But shut the F up.  But for some reason, people forget that every five minutes.  Howard can...  Shut up, Mike.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You would not say that in front of Howard.  So why don't you shut the F up, bro?  Mike, we have said it all on the radio, and Howard has chosen not to fight back,  because he knows he's got a battle on his hands for once in his life. 
[00:16:00]  So shut up.  No, dude.  No, I'm not, because you know...  The F up.  Shut up.  I think Howard could defend himself.  Right.  And what?  You can't have fun?  He's a personality.  He's in the public eye.  And let it be known, we're the first jocks he did not fight.  Yeah, come on.  First ones.  Right here.  Opie and Anthony, first ones.  We're all one big happy family, Opie.  Isn't that right?  I'm not going to let little Mike try to get to us, though.  Can't have a little fun? 
[00:16:30]  Everyone wants to guess the DJ that was involved with our mayor's break.  Yeah, I know.  If the guy wasn't so cool, I would play, man.  Would he honestly get in trouble?  Huh?  Would he honestly get in trouble?  I don't know.  Now, this far removed from the situation, we ought to call him up and ask.  You want to call him?  Yeah, call him up and ask him if it would be okay to reveal that.  It would be good publicity for his morning show.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  Absolutely.  Which can be heard.  No.  I won't say it.  Huh?  Which can be heard.  I won't say it.  I've got to think this one over.  We'll call him.  You can't F your friends, man.  No, I'm saying this might not be an F-ing at all.  All right.  All right, we're just getting started, Anthony.  Yes.  Today's a very exciting day because we start the Moms I'd Like to F contest.  Yeah.  You know, we've had a lot of things that we've done in here with the various ladies.  We have the lesbian couch where girls can come in and, if they feel so inclined, have their first ever experience with another girl, which is a lot of fun. 
[00:17:30]  We've had the teen pajama parties in here where we get teen girls to jump around and have a little fun.  But now, some of the ladies that are a little older are a little angry with us and saying that they're not included.  So, this opens it up to them.  If you're a mom and you feel you're hot, we're going to have the Moms I'd Like to F contest.  You come down.  You're in some sexy lingerie.

Mm-hmm.  I like that.  Hey, what else you got in here?  You got the black and what else?  What?  What else are you?  I'm half black and half Puerto Rican.  Oh, I like that.  Man, you must.  F like a rat.  You're wild.  You're just going crazy.  Yes, I think a compliment from LL.  What up, son?  What's up, son? 
[00:23:00]  Freaking LL.  Who the hell is LL?  Do we know LL?  Yes, you know LL.  How do we know?  Because he calls his show a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We want to play a phone call for you.  Rick's trying to find it.  Okay.  I got to get your opinion on something.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  You want to explain the rules of...  Damn.  You want to explain the rules of what's in my pants while we find this phone call?  All right.  We'll ask Tanya to take the phone. 
[00:23:30]  And you know where she's going to rub it as per our directions.  Without any clothing in the way.  She's going to go up and down, side to side, in a circular motion.  Just from the sound that whatever hairstyle it is, makes on the phone, we will determine,  or our best guess at least, what type of hairstyle she has.  Now, usually it's the triangle, the mohawk, the Hitler mustache, or the wood floor, also  known as the Jean Benet. 
[00:24:00]  But I think we have a different version for our African women.  Yeah.  You remember those choices?  Yeah.  There was Link from the Mod Squad.  That's right.  Which is that one.  Then there's the Mr. T.  That's right.  And then the Hitler mustache was...  The Billy Dee Williams.  The Billy Dee Williams.  And then, of course, the Rudy from the Cosby Show.  Which would be the wood floor.  All right.  Hey, Tanya...  Oh, yeah, groan and disgust, you hypocrite bastard.  Yeah, Jim Norton in the studio.  I want to play this phone call for you, Tanya, okay? 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Listen closely and tell us what you think of this.  This came in a little while ago.  All right, Derek, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I know something you should never, ever, ever do in bed.  Okay.  I'm married to a black chick.  Yeah.  Does she appreciate that?  Well, listen, we're in bed.  We're going at it.  I mean, shock Zulu style.  She's going absolutely nuts.  She's screaming.  She's going crazy.  Yeah.  So, of course, I get a little excited.  Uh-oh.  She turns to mush. 
[00:25:00]  So, I tell her, put a little nigger in there.  Oh, my God.  Her head snaps around.  A dreadlock hits me in the face.  I'm telling you, we went from playing jungle fever to being in a jungle safari.  It was like a tiger hunting me, chasing me around the house.  What exactly...  Wait, wait, wait.  What exactly did you mean by put a little nigger in it?  Well, black girls have a little rhythm to them that white girls don't have.  And once they start dropping it on you like that, you don't know where you are. 
[00:25:30]  So, I guess she wasn't doing that.  So, you figured you'd get her to do it by saying that?  Oh, my God.  I thought the...  I was calling her, you know, African princess.  Come on, my little black princess.  And then I said nigger into it.  Holy.  You have no idea.  I can only imagine.  I'm telling you, she turned into one of those shock zulu looking chicks.  Shock zulu.  Her teeth slid up.  Her nose slid up. 
[00:26:00]  What you talking about?  I'm a lawyer and a diva.  Star Jones.  No one tell me to put a little nigger in it.  I'll whoop your ass.  Hell yeah.  And that's the phone call.  Tanya, did you hear that?  Yeah, I heard that.  Has anyone ever told you that?  No, I've never heard that before.  That would seem like something white guys should stay away from.  That's pretty funny, though.  Yeah, okay.  I guess you can't handle it.  And without the R, you've just got to use nigger. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Like that, you know.  But I can only see a black guy saying that.  And then it's like, yeah, baby.  You know, put a little nigger in it, honey.  And she's like, uh-huh.  You know, and then she goes.  But a white guy should probably never say that.  Yeah.  Put a little Caucasian in it, sweetie.  Great.  That's wonderful.  Fantastic, baby.  All right, Tanya, you ready to play What's in My Pants?  Yes, I am.  And you're naked and all that?  I am.  Now, this has got to remain kind of hot.  So could you tell LL to shut his mouth during this portion of the phone call? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And we've got to play the theme song.  All right, Tanya, if you will.  If you're naked, take the phone and do the up and down for us.  Up and down. 
[00:27:30]  Let's all listen very closely.  Very closely.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Hello?  I so know this one.  Now, Tanya, make sure you don't give us any clues when we finally do guess as to what you have until we ask you.  Now, um...  Wait.  Can I tell her to just turn down the radio in the background?  That's going to distract us a bit, all right?  All right.  Because we're on a delay.  All right, Tanya, go side to side.  Okay. 
[00:28:00]  Hello?  Yeah, you've got to turn that radio down.  You've got to turn it off, Tanya.  Come on.  That's not our radio.  I'm hearing the music in the background.  All right.  It's bleeding through.  Was it Opie?  No, it's just bleeding through.  All right.  I swear.  All right.  Side to side again, please.  Okay.  Everyone listen.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  There's definitely something there.  Why did you say side to side?  Because somebody else was going up and down.  Is Lorenzo doing the moving of the phone?  Is LL helping you with this?  No, not anymore.  He's in another room now.  All right.  Now the circular motion.  A circular motion.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, man.  Hello?  Wow.  There is something going on there.  Opie, this just in. 
[00:29:00]  The Rudy from the Cosby Show can also be called the Scatman Crothers.  If you want it.  Whichever one.  It still works.  It's good.  It's good.  All right, Tanya.  Can you do up and down?  Garbage man.  Garbage man.  You got to shine.  Mr. Turkle.  Hello?  Yeah, up and down again.  Up and down again.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Me and my grandma.  Yeah?  Conversations with each other without saying a word. 
[00:29:30]  20 legs of lamb.  You need to hear another one in.  No, I think I have it.  No, you need to hear another one, don't you?  Okay.  Which one would you like to hear again?  All right.  I need the side to side.  I'm pretty sure.  I will be surprised.  I am changing my guess on that last sound.  Oh, you never change your guess. 
[00:30:00]  Changing it.  Changing it.  All right.  Tanya, don't tell us, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Opie, you want to go first?  Yeah, it's Mr. T.  You're saying Mr. T?  Without a doubt.  All right.  Norton.  I got to go with Mr. T.  You're going with Mr. T?  Rick?  What do you think, man?  That's a tough one, I know.  That's a tough one.  It just sounds grisly.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think?  Really fine triangle.  Okay.  I'm going to say a full just triangle. 
[00:30:30]  That's what I was going to go with.  I got to say that.  I'm going to go with the link from the ModScore.  A pool rack filled with Afro hair.  Yeah, you know, the racks you use at pool tables to rack up the balls?  Fill that up with Afro hair.  That's what it looks like.  And I was going to go with that.  Yeah.  But I got to explain something.  What did you hear?  Tanya, do the side to side again.  Okay.  Listen for short strokes.  Okay.  Short strokes.  Short strokes.  Yeah, but I'm not hearing anything different.  Short strokes.  I'm not hearing a different change in the tone, which leads me to believe it's consistent. 
[00:31:00]  A cross, up, and down.  But she knows there's nothing else going on on the outside, so she's just going like this.  All right.  Well, you know something?  It's out there.  Our guesses have been made.  Tanya, if you would please tell us what is in your pants.  Mr. T.  Yeah!  You know something?  I got to say something, though.  Tanya used a deceiving stroke.  Why?  Because she only rubbed it on the part that was there. 
[00:31:30]  But that's what I just explained to you.  I know, but that's really bad.  That's part of the thing.  I know.  It's very clever and very talented of Opie right there, guessing that.  But I would say she would have to rub it completely across the region instead of just where the  actual mohawk is, the Mr. T is.  The short strokes gave it away, my friend.  Yes, it did.  Okay.  You're very clever.  I got to give it to Opie.  Isn't he?  Well, why aren't you working on the cure for AIDS or something, Opie?  Hey, guys.  Yeah?  I have a question for you.  Oh, don't say you're a man or anything. 
[00:32:00]  Hi.  I just rubbed it on my slaw.  No, I can assure you that I am 100% with you.  You're the woman, yo.  Trust me.  Is that Opie she said?  I'm not Tanya.  I'm Tony.  Wow.  I don't think it's all dirty.  What's up, Tanya?  No.  I was just wondering if you guys had tickets for tonight's wrestling.  I don't even know if...  I don't know.  We'll give you something.  I'll hold the line, all right?  Okay.  Tanya, you done?  Thank you.  You done with us?  Yeah.  You guys were fun.  All right.  Thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  No problem.  I pity the fool do a short stroke. 
[00:32:30]  I pity the fool don't guess a Mr. T.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my past?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my past?  Oh, you're very naughty.  All right, Joe.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to ask Tanya that, you know, now that she's done with the game, is you think 
[00:33:00]  LL is going to get any stank on his hang-low?  Any stank on his hang-low?  Stank on the hang-low.  He's going to bump up that mushroom.  Well, I don't know.  Wait, put Tanya back on hold.  Let's talk to her.  Put her on hold for a second.  I've never heard of such a thing, Opie.  Let me ask Tanya.  All right, Anthony?  Tanya?  Yes?  Joe wants to know if LL is going to get his skank on his hang-low. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, skank.  I said skank.  Skank.  Yeah, that's what you want to do.  Ah!  That was an interesting little tone.  Holy S.  Hold on a minute.  Joe.  Joe.  Yeah?  Stank on his hang-low.  All right.  Is LL going to get some stank on his hang-low?  Is she going to bump up on that mushroom?  Tanya?  Tanya, comment?  Uh, well, actually, LL wants to rephrase for that. 
[00:34:00]  What?  Yo, yo.  Yeah.  What up, yo?  What's up?  What's up with everybody calling me some skank on my hang-low?  What's up with that?  Are you going to be, you know, bumping uglies?  Let me tell you, man.  She's 20.  I'm 33.  Yo.  I remember you.  You're the guy that sounds like LL Cool J.  That's why you call me LL.  Remember, I threw up in your studio, man.  Yo, LL, you should be quiet and get some stank on that hang-low.  Hey, yo, who's this?  Who's this?  Who is that?  This is the assistant head balloon-out.  What up, y'all?  You're patient.  Yo, she's going to, you know, she, honestly, she does me too much, yo. 
[00:34:30]  I can't even hang with her no more.  Nice.  Just like that.  You're going to get in that G to the A to the P?  To the gap, baby.  All the way up in the gap, if you know what I'm saying, LL.  Get off the phone and get some stank moving, LL.  Great career choice to keep that street cred up.  The G to the A to the P to the gap.  I'm going to get into the V to the A to the G.  Bad, LL.  While you're getting some stank on your hang-low, just keep saying waddle-doodle.  Waddle-doodle.  All right, Joe.  We got it.  Have fun, guys.  All right.  LL, you're all right.  Yo, man, yo, I had to pimp her out for you. 
[00:35:00]  You know what I'm saying?  My pimp hand is all that.  She'll tell you.  Pimp hand.  But listen, yo.  Yeah.  One day down the road, she went to give me an anal on the air, too, so.  All right.  Well, that's always.  Whatever you guys are ready.  Sure, that's always a lot of fun to check out.  Okay, terrific.  Right.  We'll work on that.  Fabulous.  Yo, guys, thanks for everything, man.  All right, LL.  We'll hold on.  Hold on.  He's holding.  All right.  We got him on hold.  He's holding.  Okay.  Wait, wait, Jim.  What's that, Jim Norton?  Jim Norton?  When somebody says they have a Mr. T, does that mean it's short and cropped or that there's 
[00:35:30]  cancer in it?  What the hell, Jim?  Could be either, Jim.  Jim's just laughing and falls off.  Where did your life go so wrong?  Huh?  Oh, it made me happy.  That was just a nice experience and you just had to ruin it for everybody.  No, I like her.  It's just the expression.  The Mr. T.  Well, you got to ask.  You got to ask.  Evan.  Yvonne. 
[00:36:00]  Yvonne.  Yvonne.  Hi, first time caller.  Right on.  What's up?  I just want to tell you guys that I know some people in Dallas at Marriage Travel Agency.  They've had your wild tickets since before you guys got syndicated.  Oh, yeah?  I sent them over to them overnight and I was bragging about you guys.  Now they're all excited.  If you guys are actually there, I just wanted to say go, guys.  Yvonne?  Yes?  Are you a beautiful African princess?  Actually, I'm Hispanic and Puerto Rican.  I mean, Puerto Rican and black.  Oh, another Puerto Rican and black.  Yes, I was listening to that.  How about that? 
[00:36:30]  How about that?  Don't mess with me.  Goodbye.  I'm hanging up before you guys get to me.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Because we'll get to you.  I bet you would.  Goodbye.  Her friends are psyched that we're now being hurt in Dallas, Anthony.  I just hope our listeners in Dallas have no-dos so they can listen to the whole show.  I know.  It runs a little late.  I was going to ask Yvonne if her boyfriend was getting any stank on his hang low and you  hung up on him, bumping up that mushroom, and I couldn't ask.  I wanted to try out my new street talk to help your street cred. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, boy.  It's that mushroom.  How's this going to play in Dallas?  God damn, you know what the hell I heard last night?  Something about bumping up a mushroom.  They were talking to a couple chiggers.  Oh, my God.  Everyone knows that's a bug in a garden.  That's right.  Jesus.  Anyway.  Well, there we go.  A nice round of what did we learn?  Sure.  Love that game. 
[00:37:30]  Love that game.  Any ladies show up for our Moms I'd Like to F contest?  Not yet.  God, these contests always start off slow.  They always start slow.  Yeah, but you know how they always end up.  Very well.  Yeah.  And we will guarantee that once again.  Great trip as a prize.  Ladies, moms, come on down.  Easy as that.  We have Allison coming down, right?  Yeah.  Best-ass contest winner, Allison.  Who happens to be a mom.  Whose daughter just graduated high school.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Nice.  Bring the daughter down.  The daughter's got a set of guns on her.  No, she brought her daughter down once.  Yeah, right?  Remember?  Yeah, her daughter's like 17 or so.  Yeah.  I think.  She's kind of a big gal.  The daughter?  Right.  The daughter was nice.  Don't ruin it.  Hey, what did I say bad?  We don't know how the mom popped her out, because the mom is still tiny.  See, now you're insulting.  What?  I was being nice.  I just said she's kind of a big gal. 
[00:38:30]  You know, a lot of guys are into that.  They like that.  Ah, Frank, what's going on?  Ah, just calling to defend Howard.  You guys talking about he wouldn't, or you wouldn't go against him, or he wouldn't go against you.  You guys work for the same company.  That's right.  That's right, Frank.  That's what I'm trying to tell everybody. 
[00:39:00]  You know, Howard's not going to dump on you guys.  Right.  That's right.  No one's a dumping on nobody.  God damn.  Well, I think that's kind of unfair, you guys.  Well, what the hell's on fire?  Yeah, well.  Where are you from, my friend?  Uh.  Well, God damn.  Uh-huh.  Where are you from, Frank?  I'm from Mississippi.  Mississippi.  That's right.  Where the hell are you listening to us?  In Philadelphia.  Philly.  Yeah.  We're big Howard fans here. 
[00:39:30]  Well, that's right.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's wonderful.  Like I said.  Did we say there was anything wrong with that?  We're just trying to defend ourselves.  Well, you're missing the point.  You guys both work for infinity.  Don't you think Howard's not going to?  I think you're missing the point.  Now, put your finger on top of your head and feel it.  That's the point.  The big point on that pinhead.  Uh-huh.  God damn.  Mississippi.  But anyway, I talked to a fellow a while ago.  He says that it's in all the New York papers.  You called the fellas down there? 
[00:40:00]  What the hell is a fella?  He put a gag order or something.  Fellers.  What is all that about?  That is old news, Frank.  There ain't no goddamn gag order.  I haven't heard about you guys down here until a month ago.  That's right, because we wasn't there.  It's kind of hard to hear about us when we ain't there.  But now we're there and people hear about us.  That's right.  It's like some kind of magic.  Uh-huh.  Like a whole thing of magic.  All of a sudden, you wasn't there.  But I turn on the radio and goddamn you there. 
[00:40:30]  Well.  It's the devil's work.  It's what it is.  It's the devil's work.  Like I said, you guys ought to be honest like Howard.  We ought to be honest.  That's right.  You'll find we're pretty honest, Frank.  I'll be honest right now.  I done had sex with my sister, too.  I done had no sister.  Miss her.  Look, I got to go.  I got to get to work.  I just want to touch base with you guys.  What you do for a living there, Frank?  Enjoy the show.  Frank, what you do?  Frank.  What you do for a living there, Frank?  I'm a carpenter.  You're a carpenter.  Just like Jesus Christ. 
[00:41:00]  What?  Just like Jesus Christ was a carpenter.  Uh-huh.  Right up until the Jews killed him.  Uh-huh.  Well, look, like I say, I just wanted to touch base with you.  Thanks for taking my call, and I'm a listener, and like you guys.  Thanks a lot there, Frank.  Yeah, we'll see you.  You're a good old boy.  Uh-huh.  Later.  Well.  Yeah!  Woo-hoo!  Goddamn, I could use me a stump-broke cow about now. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  If that's what we have to look forward to, I want to stop this syndication thing right  now.  I want to nip it in the bud.  Thank you, Church Burger.  That guy's from Philly.  I know, but he's from Mississippi.  Well.  We got some people from Mississippi here in New York.  Isn't that amazing?  You just get tagged like that?  Doesn't matter what he says.  You could be like, I'm from Philly.  No, you ain't.  God damn.  Well, we got a fan in Frank.  We'll play a little ditty for Frank. 
[00:42:00]  This one going out to Frank?  Frank?  Oh, yeah.  She was a fast machine. 
[00:42:30]  She kept the motors clean.  She was the best damn woman that I've ever seen.  She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies.  Knocked me out with them American guys.  Taking more than a share.  Had me fighting for air.  She told me to come, but I was already there.  If the walls was a-shaking, the earth was a-quickin'.  My mind was a-shaking.  We wasn't making it here. 
[00:43:00]  Shoot me all night long.  Let me tell you now, yeah.  Shoot me all night long.  Working double time on my seduction.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Bunch of perverted crackers.  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other? 
[00:43:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  This is where you go.  You want authentic Italian food in a nice, warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant?  You've got to go to Paisano.  Right there on Mulberry Street.  It's the heart of Little Italy.  You go there, and especially in the nice weather that's out there now, boy, they close the street down.  You sit at a table outside.  You eat great food.  You get to people watch. 
[00:44:00]  It's just a great dining experience down at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  The portions are huge, and they've got these incredible pasta lunch specials.  You'll be taking some home.  Great for the whole family.  Ask for Joey, the owner, and you get a glass of wine in the house.  And Paisano's got a great wine list, too.  So check that out.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's right there in the heart of Little Italy, 136 Mulberry.  Call them up, 965-1188, 965-1188.  We go there all the time.  You're going to love it.  It's open seven days a week, weekends till 2, Paisano of Mulberry Street. 
[00:44:30]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Right in.  Yeah.  I got instant feedback.  We welcome all instant feedbacks. 
[00:45:00]  From Danielle.  Yeah.  We can't win on this program.  And you know I love African princesses.  Princesses.  Princesses.  African princesses.  Right?  But there's a certain type I like.  I kind of like the cafe latte.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Danielle has a problem with that.  Okay.  If you guys want to really lose black women as listeners, keep up with the whole light skin 
[00:45:30]  is better than all other colors of black nonsense.  See?  It's not like this is South Africa.  Opie, there is a kind of inter-race racism that goes on in the black community.  It's light skin dogs against black skin dogs.  And it's really there.  It exists.  Mm-hmm.  So keep that up.  This is not the first time I heard you guys say it, but I really try to give you the benefit  of the doubt.  Black people have been trying to deal with this subject for years. 
[00:46:00]  In capital letters.  Years.  Right.  And you people aren't making the matter any better.  Seriously.  Cut it out.  That's just my personal choice.  Personal taste.  You should be able to explain and talk about your personal tastes without having to drag race  into it.  When I go banging black women, I like them cafe latte.  You like cafe latte.  Right?  Quite frankly, the dark, the real dark, like the Mickey Rivers, they scare me.  You don't like that?  Well, Opie, see now, see?  You got to bring it to a fear thing.  But they do scare me. 
[00:46:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Come on.  I don't know.  I like that.  Nice.  Like, like, like Hershey's syrup.  That's what I like.  Nice.  Just take down that ball.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  You see the great black dark-winged bat?  I like that.  Right?  Hershey's syrup, not bad.  We're talking, like, black.  Like, black.  Black coffee.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that, too.  Right?  See?  There you go. 
[00:47:00]  I like cafe latte, but all the hookers Jim Norton picks up.  I like cafe latte, too.  I have no skin color or hair preference.  If they have a nice dumper, I like them.  I really don't care.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Cafe latte, they're just, that skin tone is just so hot.  Really?  Without a doubt.  Better than an Italian girl with a tan.  I like the color of, what's his name there?  James from Good Times.  That color.  That shade.  Do you like James from Good Times? 
[00:47:30]  The color.  The color.  I like Florida, though.  James!  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, he's into the cafe latte, James.  He might like Walona, James.  No, she was a little too dark, Anthony.  Walona?  Halle Berry.  Halle Berry, you like that?  Perfect skin tone.  Perfect.  Mike.  Thelma.  Hey, what's up, Mom?  Thelma.  Thelma.  Thelma was solid.  Thelma was a little too dark.  Really?  A little too dark.  Oh, you're insane. 
[00:48:00]  A little too dark.  What a dumper.  Mike, what's going on?  Like an ice cream.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  So, first of all, Anthony, you do the best white cracker rhetoric I've ever heard in my life.  Thank you, my man.  That was so frickin' funny.  I wanted to grab a couple of them up and go in the back of my truck.  But for real, yo, the chances are the guy who wrote the letter has got a white woman anyway.  No, I think it was a girl.  It was a lady.  Oh, it was a girl?  It was a lady.  Oh, but then you know how it is.  White, black women always got that problem because if it was a guy, we'd look for that light-skinned  with sisters anyway.  See? 
[00:48:30]  Look at that.  Hey, hey, hey, let's be for real because we want something close to a white woman as we  can possibly get.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  And this is coming from a black man.  Hey, listen.  I just think, you know, they look better.  Well, you know, I like the...  My preference, Anthony.  Some guys like Puerto Rican women.  Some guys like Irish women.  When it comes to black women, I like the cafe lattes.  And the cafe latte, hey, if you got a nice cafe latte with a big booty and some big boobs,  you all good.  You know what's happening all over major cities right now? 
[00:49:00]  What?  Dark-skinned black women's heads are going like snakes back and forth.  I'll tell you something.  And that's why we don't want them.  Let me tell you, I got a man.  Hey, man.  And he's locked up.  You don't like...  Oh, my God.  You are really busting apart the stereotypes.  You're sending your people back 200 years.  First of all, especially these young girls out here now, they want somebody who is a  thug, thugged out, all that mess.  Nah, nah.  You get me somebody, some nice-skinned sister, you know, so I can tap that booty a little  bit. 
[00:49:30]  It's all good.  Tap that booty a little bit?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Tap that booty.  See?  It's like, you got to pull a little arm and then, you know, a little beer come out.  Oh, my God.  Yo, yo, Mike.  Yo, what's up, baby?  You got benefits?  Hey, bro, look here.  Because I ain't looking for the benefits.  Isn't that funny now?  The chicks all looking for the benefits.  All they want is a slong and a job.  They happy.  You got a job?  What have you done for me lately?  That's right. 
[00:50:00]  I come home every night at the same time to a pot ready for me.  A pot booty.  Hey, listen.  I don't discriminate.  I take a black, white, 8 to 80, triple crazy.  I don't care.  Wait.  Oh, slow down for us white folk.  8 to 80.  What did you just say?  8 to 80?  8 to 80, blind, cripple, or crazy.  I don't care.  You don't care.  I don't care.  Because when it comes out to it, I want somebody who's going to be there with the booty ready  to give it to me. 
[00:50:30]  Low maintenance.  I ain't got to talk to her.  All I got to do is roll you over and tell her.  See that right there?  See?  See?  See, that's the attitude I'm talking about.  Let me go to the white women.  I just need a man that's going to pay the rent and pay my children's benefit.  Amen, brother.  Amen, sister.  Thank you, Mike.  Yo, you got it too much.  All right.  Thank you, Mikey.  Bye.  Mikey's off the hook, yo.  I want to talk to the lady, though, that wrote that instant feedback. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Sounds like Mike has a lot of cheddar.  Cheddar.  Cheddar.  LL.  Yo, sorry to bother you again, but let me just...  Twice in one day, LL.  Let me clean this up for you real quick, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  The whole recent thing about the dark women and Opie, I'm agreeing with you, all right?  Wait, can I slow you down for a second?  And all kidding aside, I had no idea that was going on in America.  Oh, yeah.  I thought that was more of a South African thing.  No, no.  I really thought, you know, we just all got along as far as, like, you know, in the black community. 
[00:51:30]  No, we don't get along.  I'm going to tell you why.  So you see a light-skinned black and you get pissed at them?  American blacks also don't get along with real Africans that come over here and have a lot of problem with people from the Caribbean.  Yo, Pete, I'm a light-skinned black, all right?  And the whole thing with the light-skinned against the dark-skinned blacks is that the dark-skinned blacks, they're so militant, they're so much blacker than us.  And they're jealous of us because we've got the nicer hair.  We're much better.  We're just more presentable than they are.  I'm sorry. 
[00:52:00]  You guys, see, you know something?  Let me explain something.  I'll be serious.  You guys have to unite as a people, not as a lighter or darker skin.  That's the problem in the black community.  You guys got to get together as one race and just, you know, work the system.  We can't work the system because of the darkies, okay?  Oh, my God.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell.  I'll give you an inappropriate bell on that one.  Thank you, sir.  But let me tell you, it's the truth.  I got nothing against, this is the thing.  I date a dark-skinned chick, and she was a beautiful boy. 
[00:52:30]  I'm a black chick.  But you know what?  The hair down there was all nappy.  I was getting all caught up in there.  Yo, I'm serious.  The least with the light-skinned and the Latinas, you know, we got the best of both worlds.  We got the sugar, and we got the sweetness.  They're black and they're white.  You know something?  Do you see Asian people warring with each other about maybe one group of Asians have a flatter ass than the other ones?  I'm just saying.  Slantier eyes.  Slantier eyes.  No, they unite as a people, and that's why they're a powerhouse race in this country. 
[00:53:00]  The Jews, the Jews aren't going, we don't like the big-nosed Jews.  We don't like the smaller-nosed Jews.  But see, that's what makes the black people so special, because we don't like each other.  Listen, you're not going to get together and be a force in this country until you get together as a people yourselves.  We can't get together because I'd be looking at the dark dude saying, yo, he's going to stab me in the back.  You see, I'm a light-skinned.  Oh, my God, see?  I know I look good, man, and the dark-skinned dudes are ugly compared to me.  I'm sorry.  Holy ass.  This is what's going on, Opie. 
[00:53:30]  I swear to God, I've seen so much on this.  You know, I heard about all this in, like, South Africa.  Inter-race racism.  I really didn't know this was going on yet.  It's the truth, Opie.  We do not like the dark-skinned.  The dark-skinned don't like us.  We want to go to our own community.  Let them go to Africa, and we'll go to, you know, Toronto.  We don't care.  All right, L.L.  Peace out, Joe.  Toronto?  You don't want to go to Toronto.  Jesus.  Toronto's just filled with Asians.  Hilarious.  The Asians have taken over Toronto.  Tracy.  Yes. 
[00:54:00]  Black lady.  The guy that you just had on the phone is just pure ignorant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a brown-skinned black woman.  I'm neither dark nor light, and I can get along with the lights as well as the dark.  So you're still divvying.  Even you are divvying it up.  No.  You are right in saying the fact that that's why we can't come together as a community or as a race,  because of ignorant people like him.  He sounds stupid, and I can't believe he's on the radio saying things like that.  Just because he's light, that doesn't make him look good. 
[00:54:30]  Well, you have to admit, though, there are a lot of dark-skinned black guys and black  women that don't like light-skinned blacks either.  And vice versa.  Well, you can say the same thing for the white race.  There's a lot of blonde hair that don't like the redheads, or the reds that don't like the  punets.  You know something?  I'll be honest with you.  I don't see that really happening.  Really?  We just hate each other because they're a bunch of a-holes walking around.  We're too busy dominating the world anyway.  Jesus Christ, Norton.  I can't believe you guys, and then you white guys talk to this.  What do you know about the black race?  What I've learned. 
[00:55:00]  What have you learned, and who have you learned it from?  People like him?  No, I've learned that there's this inter-racism that goes on in the black community.  Most of it is stimulated from the white man, because even the guy, I don't know which  one of you guys said you only like him light.  Well, that's OP personal preference.  You're not looking at the personal.  You're looking at the skin tone.  Right.  That's me judging you and saying, I want you because you're alive.  But, Tracy, guys do that just in general.  They look at a physical thing first.  I understand that, but you made you generalize, you made it as being your preference without  even getting to know a darker skinned black woman. 
[00:55:30]  Well, we're not talking about knowing somebody.  We're talking about first impression of just looking.  And I think that he prefers coffee latte skinned women just because they're, in my opinion,  more attractive to me.  What makes a dark-skinned woman unattractive to you?  The features?  Because you have dark that has the same thin features as a light-skinned black woman.  You haven't looked at all the black race.  Because he looks at white women and goes, I'm not attracted to her because of her features.  Right.  What is it about the light-skinned woman that makes you more attractive than a black woman?  Like, oh, but do you like white women with a tan or without a tan? 
[00:56:00]  Uh, with a tan.  See?  You like a darker-skinned woman.  That's all.  What's a light-skinned black woman?  Tracy, if that fits the bill.  Would you look at a fat guy and just get to know him as a person or a guy who's got nice abs?  Of course, you look at the guy with nicer abs.  So stop.  You do the same thing.  Especially if you're not looking to know the guy.  Right.  You're just seeing somebody walking down the street and you're pointing out to a friend  what you find attractive.  Are you going to point to a fat...  But you're already had to tend to your mind that you're attracted to a light-skinned black  woman.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, Tracy, Tracy.  She still has to be pretty. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  You know, on a pig.  Yeah, I'm not just talking, oh, she's just cafe latte.  Wow, she's hot.  There's more to it.  Why is this such a topic for you guys?  Why can't you talk about the different...  Because we're stupid white guys.  True.  Why can't you talk about the white women and the different degrees of ugliness in that  particular race?  We do.  Oh, we've discussed that ad nauseum.  I mean, and then you want to get this jerk on the line.  We're bored, you know, picking apart the white women.  Now we want to move on to another race.  If you're born fat, you should be drowned in a tub.  I mean, we trash people all the time because of physical appearances. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Now, Tracy, the problem is with the black community.  You can't pin the fact that light-skinned blacks and dark-skinned blacks don't get along  because of white people.  How can you say that?  Because they're only brought up on what they've heard from the white race.  These people are taught as young people.  They are.  It's the 21st century, Tracy.  You've got to get together as a people.  I'm not talking about any of that.  I'm saying the black race is brought up to believe from the white people that unless 
[00:57:30]  you're light-skinned, you've got the straight hair.  So you're saying black people are under this mind control of white people and can't think  for themselves?  No, I'm not saying that.  Well, you just said that.  No, you just said white people.  It's just like the fashion magazines.  You're not considered beautiful unless you're a size two.  All right.  Yes.  Right?  Why am I talking to them?  The point of the matter is I'm saying you're part of the society.  You're part of what you brought up to believe.  All right, Tracy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  You spoke your mind, all right?  They've got to get together as a people. 
[00:58:00]  One people.  Not a divvy-up group of light, of a friggin' pink sample.  Tyrone.  You know?  Going from gray to black.  Get together as a people.  Tyrone.  Hello?  Yeah, you're on the radio, Tyrone.  Yo, what's up, O&A?  What's up?  Yo, man.  She just proved my point, man.  There are three Bs to black ladies.  Yeah.  They bitches, they drive buckets, and they got a bunch of bad credit.  Oh, my God.  You know, how come we cannot just have an intelligent conversation about race?  That was hilarious. 
[00:58:30]  Very funny.  They drive buckets?  I never heard that before.  But, you know, it could never just be a conversation.  Shaheed.  Hey, Mr. Hughes.  How are you?  Uh-oh.  Mr. Kumiya, how are you?  What's up?  Mr. Norton, how are you?  I'm good, man.  I'm a great comedian, by the way, Mr. Norton.  Thank you, buddy.  Right on.  I just want to say something, you know, real quick to all the blacks that are listening right  now, all the black people.  Thanks for setting back the black race half a century.  Absolutely.  I appreciate that.  Thank you for being as ignorant as possible. 
[00:59:00]  And hopefully one of you guys are getting lynched in the next three hours.  Thank you.  All right.  Good afternoon.  I didn't realize we had so many black people listening to us.  Opie, it's all pink in the middle.  That's all I got to say.  It's all pink in the middle.  All right.  One more call on this.  We got to move on.  Andy.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Negro hours should go over real well in Dallas.  Indication over and out.  Diamond dust.  Goddamn.  Is this the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, it is, sir. 
[00:59:30]  Well, goddamn.  I've been listening for about an hour.  Yeah.  And I got to tell you.  What the hell is this show?  I've learned more about Negroes than I ever learned in all my years being down here in Texas.  Goddamn unbelievable.  I did not know there was this problem going on with the light skins and the dark skins.  We call the light skins wetbacks down here.  Well, they're called to swim across the Rio Grande. 
[01:00:00]  And they've become farm workers and whatnot.  I didn't know there was a problem with them and the black people.  This is educational, I got to tell you.  Very educational.  We can't tell if they're just dirty.  Maybe it's just dirt from the mud or the Rio Grande.  Woo-hoo!  I got to tell you, it's like watching the goddamn Discovery Channel listening to your radio show down here in Texas.  Was that the Negro Hour? 
[01:00:30]  Was that...  Do you start every show with about an hour of talking about negros?  Because I'll listen in.  Because I think it makes us more sensitive to our issues.  And I'll be tuned in.  What's coming up next?  Is it the chinky hour?  Well, if you like, I mean...  I didn't know that when the black man has sex with the black woman, that he gets all caught up in the not be hired down there.  I learned that on your show more than I ever learned at any goddamn Klan meeting. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, speaking of Klan...  Oh, I'm late.  Yeah, that ought to go over well.  Sure, why not?  Why hold back, right in?  It's just any time.  Any time we try to have an honest discussion about race, it always turns ugly.  The phone callers start in, and who knew?  Usually it's, you know, black and white issues.  Now it's blacks and light-skinned blacks arguing with each other. 
[01:01:30]  Earl, where do you fit in?  And have you ever heard anything?  We have our own black Earl here.  Hold on, black Earl.  West Coast Dave from San Francisco.  Dave, we're coming to San Francisco.  Faggot.  And talk about the faggots.  Dave writes on the Instant Feedback,  black people call the skin-shade controversy the paper bag test.  Is the skin lighter or darker than a brown paper bag?  Is that true?  Have you heard that, Earl?  No, I haven't.  Earl's our, well, he's our black man here. 
[01:02:00]  And we go to him.  Who are you kidding?  He's the whitest black man we've ever met in our lives.  But not skin tone-wise.  Just personality-wise.  You're right on the border of the paper bag test, I might say.  No.  He's, rub his palm.  Look, see, it's coming off.  Come on, Blazing Saddles.  The classic, for God's sake.  Have you noticed anything in the community, Earl, about the black skin, dark skin?  Oh, we've known it all along.  Yeah?  It's awful.  See, it's a big thing, and it's keeping your people from getting together and really becoming 
[01:02:30]  an organized powerhouse in this country.  Rent the movie School Days.  School Days.  Spike Lee.  Spike Lee did a movie on it.  Really?  School Days.  Is it spelled D-A-Z-E?  Yes.  I love that.  That's John.  Why can't he just spell it the right way?  Why does he have to spell it that way?  Because it's in a daze.  No, it's a play on words.  Right.  Oh.  What were they called each other?  It was...  Oh.  The Jigaboos.  Wannabes and the Jigaboos.  Really? 
[01:03:00]  Is that what they call it in the movies?  That's what they call it in the movie.  Jeez.  Did you ever experience any interracial racism, Earl?  No.  Yourself?  No?  No, not at all.  You're just a likable son of a bitch.  I gotta tell you.  What a do-do.  Bone dry.  But it definitely exists.  Yeah.  Like black women who generally have issues in general.  Yeah.  Like, especially darker women hate black guys who date.  If you see a really dark-skinned black guy walking down the street with, uh, God forbid,  a white woman. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you're talking about from the viewpoint of a black woman, a very dark-skinned black  woman.  She sees a dark-skinned black guy walking down the street with a lighter-skinned black woman.  Loses her mind.  Loses her mind.  Loses her mind.  Or her TV set.  Right.  She loses her mind seeing that, too.  Come on.  Okay.  Bell.  I understand.  See, the bell makes everything okay.  It's the inappropriate bell.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  That was, uh, wonderful.  All right.  What?  Wow.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  Such an issue.  Hey, can we move on to funner things?  It's also not true that black people, uh, never get together, man.  They do a lot.  You know, normally it's called a riot, but I mean, once a while...  Oh, Jim Norton.  All right.  Let's move on.  Yeah.  How's our moms I'd like to F contest?  Yeah, how's that going, Rick?  Fuck.  What's it?  It always starts like this.  It starts very slow, and today's no different, man.  We want your hot moms.  Moms.  We want your hotness down to the studio.  Get down here. 
[01:04:30]  There's great prizes up for grabs, and you just got to come down.  You get...  Find some sexy lingerie that you used to put on, and get your, uh, ass down here, and, uh,  we'll take a couple of pics.  We'll put it up on the web, and people will vote.  We've had about 10 or 12 ladies that said they're definitely coming down.  Yeah.  Not necessarily today.  The ladies can come down all this week between three and seven.  We're going to take pictures of the hot moms, and then we're going to put your pictures  up on the internet, and, uh, our fine listeners will vote for the mom they'd like to F, and  the winner's going to get, uh, a nice vacation to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 
[01:05:00]  Can we make it all inclusive?  I mean, if it was talking about race, how about if it's not mom?  Wonderful.  We could do that.  Why not?  All right, listen.  Moms, come on down.  Why don't we clear the phone lines so we can move on to other things?  We've got to talk about the code for men.  A very interesting little, um, article in one of the magazines.  Okay, Anthony?  Men, all men of all races, creeds, doesn't matter, have come together. 
[01:05:30]  That's right.  Oh, definitely.  And they, we all as men know how to stick together, and there's a code amongst the men.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's really good.  We'll get into that next.  Anthony, we've got a pair of tickets.  Do you want to just give away one pair?  Let's stick them together.  All right, we've got a couple pairs of tickets to Derek Jeter's birthday party at the World  on Wednesday.  What?  What?  Oh, Jeter, Jeter, puppy, puppy.

[01:08:30]  Give us a call.  Pull free.  877-692-1027.  That's probably a real popular one at the weddings.  And the bar mitzvahs and whatnot.  Maria, what's going on?  Am I on the line?  Yes, Maria.  Yes, Maria.  Sorry.  Hi.  I wanted to know.  I wanted to know basically what it means for a guy to get a salad toss.  I listen to you guys all the time, but I literally have no clue.  Oh, because you're talking about the Rusty Trombo?  Yep. 
[01:09:00]  Nice.  Huh.  Oh.  So what's her question?  She doesn't...  So what does it mean for a guy to get his salad toss?  Oh, come on.  Like, I get the whole other part, but...  You don't know what a tossed salad is?  Don't worry.  I like mine with syrup.  With syrup.  Has your boyfriend asked you to toss his salad?  No.  Oh.  We're a little more direct than that.  Well, you know what the balloon...  You don't have to speak in lingo. 
[01:09:30]  You know what the balloon knot is, right?  Yes.  Anybody who doesn't know, you blow up a balloon, you tie it in a knot.  No, I listen to you guys all the time.  I've figured it out.  I'm explaining to other people, please.  Okay.  That might not know.  You blow up a balloon, you tie it in a knot, you know, you...  You tie it in a knot, and then you look right into the knot of the balloon.  What does it look like?  Yes.  It looks just like it, doesn't it?  Well, it's taking your tongue to the balloon knot.  Ah. 
[01:10:00]  That's pretty much it.  And sometimes you could add flavoring.  I like mine with syrup.  Okay, you guys cleared it up.  And then the rusty trombone, of course, you reach around and...  Yeah.  That's just a modified tossed salad.  While you're doing the tossed salad, you give the reach around to the guy and work it  like a slide trombone.  You know?  I think we have a song that explains it further in.  Oh, good.  Good.  Good. 
[01:10:30]  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while, she'll lick your spot by your tiny balloon knot.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran.  A rusty trombone may not be moral. 
[01:11:00]  While I think this sounds kind of gay, I'd rather get some oral with the nut.  Come on, honey.  Start the music.  Yeah.  You play that well.  There you go.  You play that well.  I thought that explained it.  There's another song about the rusty trombone.  Oh, we got to play that, too.  We haven't played a rusty trombone in a while.  Hey, this sucks because that will be stuck in my head now. 
[01:11:30]  The rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  Danny, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  As long as you guys are talking about the rusty trombone, I wanted to know if you ever  heard of Dogs in the Bathtub.  Dogs in the Bathtub?  I have heard Dogs in the Bathtub.  All right.  It's when you try to fit your bees in her hay, and it's as hard as keeping dogs in a bathtub.  Well, let's see.  I don't think that made the radio. 
[01:12:00]  And you try to do what?  I missed the last part, man.  Yeah.  I'm not.  Oh, boy.  When you're having fun with the balloon knot and you try to do what?  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  We're jumping out like crazy.  Okay.  Yeah.  We've had a little trouble with the alphabet thing.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's kind of coming into play right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Had a little trouble with the alphabet.  So let's not use the alphabet anymore. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's just say...  Okay.  You're using...  You're behind her.  Well...  Right?  Hold on.  No, no, no, no.  You're walking in the back door.  Ah, see?  You're going to the house.  Hold on.  All right.  You're going to the house.  See?  And you were, uh...  You're bringing...  Well, I don't know.  You're...  Hold on.  I know what you're going to say.  Yeah.  You want, um...  All of your junk to disappear. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Thank you.  All of your junk.  Yes.  Everything.  The whole...  Completely gone.  The whole kit and caboodle.  Exactly.  Damn bags included.  Yes.  Everything.  And that's as tough as keeping dogs in the bathtub.  In the bathtub.  Gotcha.  Thanks, Danny.  Thanks a lot, though.  How impossible...  What are you...  Is it a tamping pole?  James.  Yeah.  What's up?  The, uh...  Rusty Trombone song got dumped in the middle of it.  Oh.  I've heard that played in hole on here many times before.  Why all of a sudden, when Philly and Dallas can hear it for the first time, it gets cut  in half.  I bet I know that line. 
[01:13:30]  What line?  Uh...  Uh...  Right after, I'd rather get some oral, it cut right there.  I know.  Ugh.  But they...  It's bleeped out.  I...  I know.  I've heard it bleeped out before, but it...  It got dumped.  Wait.  They dumped out the part with the bleep?  That's weird.  Yeah.  Because it's bleeped.  Because it implies something.  No.  It's...  They dumped twice.  Ah.  They dumped on that first line.  They dumped twice?  Yeah.  That's what we were...  So now the song's not funny anymore. 
[01:14:00]  Ah.  No.  It's horrible.  She'll reach around and...  Ah, ah, ah.  With her hand.  Yeah.  That's the one.  Why play the song?  They gotta tell us when they're gonna dump these songs, because that was just a waste of time  now.  Complete waste of time.  It was a hilarious song, and it was just stupid sounding without those parts.  All right, James.  Thank you.  They gotta tell us if they're gonna dump, because then we won't play the song and waste it and  have a version on the air that's not funny or that you can't follow.  Oh, God damn it.  Let's try another Rusty Trombone song.  Good luck. 
[01:14:30]  Now you're doing the Rusty Trombone.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you there's nothing to it.  Show them you can play all night.  Grab that horn, hold it tight.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Put your lips right on the pole.  Gentlemen, Al, don't get too bold.  Slide it to the left and right and blow on it with all your mind.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You get horny if you play your horn alone. 
[01:15:00]  So get behind me and blow on my trombone.  Strokes in and out, my friend, while you blow the other hand.  You don't need no saxophone.  Now you're doing the Rusty Trombone.  The Rusty Trombone.  So tell them that you like this horn and you can play it all night long.  Get right down and blow a tune underneath that big old moon.  Now it's time to turn around and let your partner go to town. 
[01:15:30]  Get on your knees, give a cheer.  Dirty Sanchez, time is here.  Bang, get frosty.  When they are not used, use a lot of blues.  Strokes in and out, my friend, while you blow the other hand.  You don't need no saxophone.  Now you're doing Rusty Trombone.  Rusty Trombone.  Rusty Trombone.  Rusty Trombone.  Rusty Trombone. 
[01:16:00]  That one had to make it, right?  I don't know.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking.  What part got dumped out of that?  I know what part.  What part?  So grab my...  Did most of it make the air?  I guess most of it did, right up until the end part.  At the end.  So grab my...  My yam bag.  Ew, he was doing so well, too. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I knew it.  God damn it.  Grab my...  Right.  Grab my what?  Oh, I knew it.  I didn't even know what they were singing about in that song.  What?  Test.  One, two, three.  Test.  Easy.  What?  Easy.  Easy.  Well, you can't apply sex because there might be kids listening.  I hate your kids.  The more Columbines there are, the happier I am.  I hate your children. 
[01:17:00]  So sick of hearing...  Oh, wait a minute.  Now that I know you can't say.  You're sick of hearing about their effing kids.  Right.  You do make a good point.  We've talked about this on the show.  Can't do a song parody unless it's to the goddamn Patty Duke theme around here.  Whatever.  We'll have to bring those back into the operating room and put some bleeps in.  Well, most of the song got out there.  Yeah.  God. 
[01:17:30]  I want my kids to hear that.  My kids.  Because of that, we can't have fun as adults anymore.  No.  You could take them down to the gay parade over the weekend and watch man-on-man sex in  the streets.  But perish the thought you do a funny little ditty about the rusty trombone.  Or have them join the choir at any church.  You could do that, too.  Yeah.  Send your kids to church so they can be touched.  They'll be singing the rusty trombone song through their tears. 
[01:18:00]  They told me.  Wow, John.  Now you're doing the rusty.  John, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, John?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Listen, you have the Houdini.  What's the Houdini?  Well, I'm going to try and keep this good for the radio.  Let's see how this is.  When you're doing somebody, or a girl, obviously, big doggy style, and when she turns around. 
[01:18:30]  No?  No?  Right.  I heard that one.  I know that one.  I know.  But they're going to dump out of all these.  Yeah, we can't even describe them anymore.  They're like kids here.  We don't want kids to hear it.  We don't want your kids to hear it.  That's right, Jim.  Stupid, bad parents.  I hate your kids.  I really, genuinely hate them, and I'm sick of hearing that.  Jim, you don't like kids?  No, I really don't. 
[01:19:00]  They're cute, and they're fun to photograph naked.  Aside from that, I'm sick of them interfering with anything we want to do as adults.  Die, you little kids.  To all our new markets, that's called comedy, kids.  He doesn't really mean that.  Yeah.  No, Jim does mean that, which is frightening.  Just disgust me, stupid kids.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, he's got a point through his twisted logic.  I really do hate sacrificing adult fun because of the children. 
[01:19:30]  Every view of this, they all want two cars in the garage, so all the moms have to work now,  and their kids are unsupervised.  Shoot each other in school.  It's your fault because you're bad parents.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a little edginess on the radio.  That's going to cause your kids to start shooting.  No, it's because you're terrible parents.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow, Jim finally said something intelligent.  Wow.  I like it.  Nice. 
[01:20:00]  Do it.  Okay.  I have my kids to hear that, my kids.  I have good kids.  I'm a soccer mom.  My kids are good kids.  Soccer mom.  Dykey.  I can't say the T word.  No.  What, twat?  Yeah.  You can't say twat anymore?  Well, I don't know like that.  What?  It's got to be in the proper terminology.  Um.  It's like, Opie, don't be a twat.  That's what I was basically saying. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Right.  I got you.  PTA moms.  Get involved.  Uh, Ellis, what's up?  Ellis.  Ellis.  Somebody.  Not there anymore.  Ellis.  Hello.  Hello.  Little be my name's Alice.  Hello.  All right.  We'll take a break, Anthony, and we'll get into the code for men.  Code for men.  Very sacred code.  These are rules that all men should follow.  There's some really good ones on this list. 
[01:21:00]  Been followed for many years.  For example, I'll give one as we go to break here.  Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow party goers.  Absolutely.  No photographic evidence at bachelor parties.  Ever.  It's up to every guy to go back home to the significant other and tell them nothing happened.  Absolutely nothing happened.  You could pick out one dirtbag friend and say that he did everything.  Yeah.  That's also allowed.  I don't think that's in the code book. 
[01:21:30]  But the single guy, you can completely say everything you did that he did it and how awful it was.  Yeah.  That is so true, man.  There's always one you can blame it on.  You know Tommy.  You know Tommy.  You're a crazy son of a bitch.  He was buried face deep.  Unbelievable.  That's so true.  Don't say that in front of the kids.  All right.  Don't let the kids hear you say that because they're little or kids.  Two.  I love that lady in Houston.  She is my favorite person. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, God.  My favorite.  Oh, no.  All right, Tim.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  That's bad.  Look about a bad parent.  Exactly.  Wow.  One after the other.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  The views of Jim Norton are not necessarily those of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm sorry.  I don't want any kids to hear this.  Well, it's a very open forum here on this program. 
[01:22:30]  And if that's the way Jim Norton feels.  And can I say Jim Norton another time?  And that's the way he feels.  It's the way I feel.  I'm sick of you, parents.  I'm tired.  Hey, our first contestant for our Moms I'd Like to F contest.  Nice.  Has arrived with her fat daughter, Anthony.  I didn't say that.  I said she was a big gal.  You said fat daughter.  I did not.  What did you say?  Hold the phone.  What did you say?  I said she was a big gal.  Big.  Two words.  Big gal.  Big.  A lot of guys find big gals attractive. 
[01:23:00]  She's talking to Steve in the other studio.  What the hell is the problem?  So she's not listening to the show right now.  So what do you want to say?  She's a big gal.  The daughter, not the mom.  Right.  Right.  If you want to call her whatever you want to call her, that's fine.  But you're not dragging me into that.  She heard it.  She heard it.  She heard it.  She heard it.  I didn't say anything.  Opie was the one saying the nasty stuff.  I didn't say a thing.  You said fat.  I just interpreted what you said. 
[01:23:30]  I just said she's a big gal.  Big?  She's got huge cans.  Nice.  What do you, yeah.  I think she's lovely.  Don't try to pervert what I said into something that might make her angry.  Look at her.  She's got a sexy, I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  Have her step in for two seconds.  I didn't say it.  Come here.  Solid.  Wow.  He's twisting my words.  Oh, look how hot you are.  He's twisting things around.  I didn't say it.  I should have a present in everything.  Thank you.  Wait, let me look.  Look, you're not.  You're nice.  She's nice.  And you lost weight since the last time you were here. 
[01:24:00]  You did, didn't you?  I don't know.  Yes, you did.  You absolutely did.  How's your mom doing?  She's good.  She's good.  We call her Milfa.  That's her nickname.  Wait, Mil...  Mom, I'd like to ask a lot.  Oh, Milfa.  Milflot.  Milflot.  Milflot.  Right.  Yeah, she's a...  Wow.  Nice little bra you're wearing.  Allison's the odds-on favorite for this contest.  Yeah.  Definitely.  That's a mom.  We're going to get our pictures done.

I'm like tired of you guys partying without me here, so I brought this along.  Goldschlager.  It's Monday, and it's time to party on Monday, screw Friday.  Goldschlager.  That stuff will kill you.  Nice.  Wow.  Can we reenact the birthing between you two?  Let me tell you something.  She was only two and a half pounds when she came out.  That was the most torture I've ever felt in my entire life. 
[01:25:00]  That's it?  Two and a half pounds?  Two and a half pounds.  What happened there?  She was a peanut.  You got horseback riding?  What did you do?  How are you doing?  What, were you on the drugs or something?  Two and a half?  A lot, yeah.  Two and a half pounds?  I'm sorry.  How early were you?  Two and a half months.  Two and a half months early?  I'm sorry, but I wanted out.  Wow.  She wanted out.  That's a present she put.  What is it?  Pick it up.  I don't touch anything.  Pick it up.  I touch nothing. 
[01:25:30]  That's narcotics, ma'am.  Oh.  Wow.  You got to celebrate.  Come on.  I, um, yeah.  Do you think she's, do you still think she's big, Ant, the daughter?  No, it, look, if you put all girls on this scale that you have written out on your, on  your paper, she's nice.  You know.  She's nice, big.  Nice.  That's what I'm saying.  Then that's what I said.  Nice, big.  I didn't say anything.  You said, oh, oh, uh, uh, the mom's here with her fat daughter.  Who said that? 
[01:26:00]  No, you said, you said that.  I interpreted what you said.  I just said you were a big gal.  What does big usually mean?  Guns.  That's, yeah.  I think she's lovely.  She has wow stickers on her car.  She participates.  See?  Oh, that's not the problem.  There's no problem here.  Opie, you're trying to make problems where there aren't any.  Do you think I do that on this radio show?  Yeah.  Oh, every chance you get.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  Why don't you get into your fine outfits?  Okay. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Mother and daughter.  Nice.  The first contestant and the moms we like to, uh, F.  Wow, she's getting naked in the studio.  Wow, she's just ripping those clothes off.  Oh, I didn't know you were going to get changed in front of us.  Look at your mom's body.  She's hot.  Nice.  Isn't that hot?  You ever fantasize about your mom?  Because we do.  Incest is not my big thing.  No?  Allison won the.  I don't do the incest.  She won the best ass contest, too.  Look at that.  Look at her belly.  Are you sure she's not adopted?  Absolutely.  Because I'm saying, it doesn't look like you've had children. 
[01:27:00]  No stretch marks whatsoever.  That's a good thing to do, too.  Premature birth to keep those stretch marks down.  Right?  And so you don't get a belly.  They're all here.  Because my boobs were like hers.  They walked into a room before I did.  And what happened?  She took them.  That was it.  You used to have big boobs, and then you don't anymore.  Oh, when I was pregnant, I did.  Oh, when you were pregnant.  And they transferred.  What do you think of that?  I lost everything.  This is so nice.  You really have an amazing ass.  Thank you.  Are we allowed to say that on the radio?  No, no, no.  It might be a kid listening. 
[01:27:30]  I want a kid to see your ass.  How about an amazing dumper?  We can say that.  Yeah.  And I really can't wait to show you guys the pictures from the photo shoot that Brian Moss did.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Those are really good pictures of my ass, framed and all.  Nice.  All right.  Nice.  Nice wrap on the floor.  Mom, daughter.  Why don't we get the pictures taken so we can share with our audience?  Yeah, immediately.  Okay.  These will be up on WNAW.com a little later today.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  All right.  We'll talk to you guys in a little bit.  We've got to take a break, so. 
[01:28:00]  And we'll be back.  There's hot Allison.  Yes.  There she goes.  And her chubby daughter.  I was going to ask her daughter when the Wilson Phillips reunion is.  All right.  See?  See?  Do you see how he works?  Do you see how this guy operates?  What?  What?  What?  Do you see?  I hope everyone's getting a whole good perspective on Opie. 
[01:28:30]  What happened?  He's really nice.  All nice.  All nice.  Right.  He sneaks up on you and makes you cry.  That's what a girl sent to me in the instant message that one time.  Yeah.  Sneaks up on you and makes you cry.  He said it.  Oh, yeah.  Who said that?  Who said it?  Because, you know, I heard it.  Wait.  Don't look at me.  Because who said it?  I want you to know who said that.  Jim, who said it?  I'm on the train here.  Yeah.  I heard it.  I heard the phrase.  I heard the word fat. 
[01:29:00]  I didn't say fat.  Yep.  Say it.  It's all right.  I did not say fat.  Don't you even start now.  You're backing up Opie.  He doesn't need help.  I don't know what they're talking about, Ed.  I just said big.  You're a bigger gal than usually we see coming down here and stuff.  That's all I'm saying.  And guys love that.  You're very pretty.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not saying I'm not using the word fat.  I haven't used the word fat.  I kind of think I heard fat, though.  I didn't say it.  I was on the train and I heard it.  I will swear. 
[01:29:30]  I will say pull the goddamn tape.  Now you're going to have to pull tape on earlier in the show.  I heard behemoth, too.  So you can hear.  Damn, I must say that.  Well, obviously he wasn't talking about your junk.  Come on, Ed.  Why?  I really like this lady.  Pull the tape.  She's nice.  I'm willing to say pull the tape because I know what I said.  We don't tape shows.  Pull the tape.  Pull the tape.  We don't tape our radio show, Anthony.  You know that.  Yeah.  It's okay, though.  I don't mind.  I didn't say it.  I will swear.  I will swear.  Now she's making excuses for something I did not say. 
[01:30:00]  It's all right.  I do not like this.  You're a sexy girl.  See?  You really are.  And she showed her ass once, and it's a very nice ass.  I saw her boobs once.  That I definitely don't remember.  I don't remember my ass.  But, Ed.  Yeah, you showed your ass when you were in here last time.  Would you like to show your ass?  No, no.  Mom's definitely got the ass portion covered.  You got the boob.  Yeah.  Boob's covered.  I'm the T.  She's the A.  We got it covered.  There you go.  Mother, daughter.  Got a lot of it.  Nice lips, too.  And I'm not even being nasty with her.  She has very sexy.  Very sexy.  Nice drag on it.  That's nice with saying. 
[01:30:30]  The lower lip drag.  She got the nice lower lip drag.  You know what I mean?  Things I could do to that at gunpoint.  Oh, Jesus Christ, man.  I personally like her smile.  Thank you.  Look at that smile.  See?  Her eyes light up.  Her ears of orthodontics.  That's about it.  Really?  Now, step through the door and watch what Opie says.  Because he's a prick.  Shut up, you ass.  He tries to say it when she's, like, in the middle of the doorway.  Look at that smile.  I know.  I said she's a pretty girl. 
[01:31:00]  How could you say anything bad about her?  I didn't.  Look at the smile.  Look at the teeth.  I didn't.  She's got nice eyes that kind of sparkle when she smiles.  Yeah.  You don't got to sell me, Opie.  And look at those boobs.  Damn.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  We'll see you outside in a little bit.  She goes out to support her mom as her mom takes pictures.  All right.  Is she going out there to talk to Tootie or Miss Garrick?  I didn't say that.  He said that.  See?  He said that. 
[01:31:30]  I didn't say a word.  And she will not catch me saying a word.  But you guys are ruthless.  And I'm getting the blame for it.  You started it.  I did not.  You said the mom with her big daughter.  Ruthless.  As a ruthless.  I think she's lovely, Anthony.  That's what I said.  Too bad she hangs out with gay guys.  She is a fag hag.  I'll say that.  She admitted to that.  Must have been out of field day at Greenwich Village during the gay parade this weekend.  Were you there, Norton?  Absolutely not. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  We've got to take a break, right?  Yeah.  Rick's going to take pictures of Allison.  Contest is finally on.  Moms, I'd like to F.  We're hoping other moms show up.  Hopefully today would be nice.  Roy.  If you can't, just get down here anytime this week between 3 and 7 so we can take your pictures.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Anything else you sick apps want to say about that fine-looking lady?  I think she's very cute, and believe me, if her mother wouldn't cut my head off, I'd bang her in a second.  There you go.  There's a rousing endorsement. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, wow.  O.P.  What did you learn on the show today?  Really not too much, dear.  Not anything useful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost brain cells today.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today, this bit still sucks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[01:34:00]  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Nice.  Yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, toll free, 877-692-1027.  Chris Cornell's going to sing with rage, huh?  Yeah.  Timmy, interesting.  He should just stick to solo.  I like that Chris Cornell.  He's good.  He's good.  Let's go to Pete. 
[01:34:30]  More good or singer.  Pete, what's going on?  Yo, listen to me.  You two guys are tools.  Why?  We know the code, and it's just for the guys to know the code.  You can't be going, I got my wife going to come out in the car in a minute,  and you're going to give away the whole bachelor party code.  No.  What's going on with you?  Don't you know exactly what you guys explained before is exactly what I told her,  and you're going to give it away.  Pete, know what it is?  It's very obvious things.  No, but you're going to borrow my cover.  Don't you think you're going to start talking about that bachelor party,  and she's going to look at me, and she's going to go, oh, yeah? 
[01:35:00]  The only thing we said about bachelor parties, according to the code,  any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.  And you also said that you're always blaming on the one guy.  That's true, though.  He does everything.  Well, that's it.  Then don't be the one guy.  You're going to ruin it.  You know what, though?  I've never participated at a bachelor party.  No.  I swear.  I've seen some wild stuff there.  Listen, listen, I've admitted a lot of things on this radio show, stuff I shouldn't admit. 
[01:35:30]  That's one I've got to tell you.  I've never participated.  Never.  Yeah, but, dude, it doesn't matter if you did or didn't, because they don't care.  Especially if they hear verbatim what you just tell them.  Usually it's the uncles that haven't had sex in 20 years.  I've paid for oral treats.  You guys, I'm going to have to tell them.  All right, Pete.  I'm going to have to tell them that annoying laugh Anthony's on, and I had to shut you guys off.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Yeah, just work it that way.  All right, you guys are the best.  All right, bud.  I don't like being involved in bachelor party stuff. 
[01:36:00]  To tell you the truth, I'm very skeeved out by a lot of those girls.  I don't want to catch anything.  You always hear the stories, though.  Oh, yeah, this one went into the room and got this and that.  Then the dildo show comes out.  Egg shooting.  Gets all messy.  I got one in a bathroom stall.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she was sitting in a toilet.  That's classy, Jim.  I just...  That is so classy.  Everything you could love wrapped up in a one.  In the toilet stall.  Yeah, in Pennsylvania.  I just watched Scarface again. 
[01:36:30]  And when Tony Montana goes into the bathroom and his sister Gina is in the bathroom stall with that guy,  just punching him.  He knows how to treat a lady.  Yeah.  Bringing you in the bathroom.  Making it in the toilet.  Very funny.  Do you want to read some of the rules?  Some of the codes.  These are just codes that men live by and we can all relate and agree.  A lot of them are stupid, like this one.  Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella. 
[01:37:00]  Well, that's true.  That's true, right?  Well, maybe if they'd rained at the gay parade over the weekend, you'd see a lot of umbrella sharing.  You'd see them as an umbrella stand.  Can you open that umbrella?  No.  Hmm.  Tight.  Rachel.  Yes, I want to say that you guys sound like idiots.  Oh, thanks.  You sound just like Howard Stern.  Exactly like him.  Oh, yeah?  You've got your own personalities.  Oh, because this one's working so well for us, Rachel.  No, why don't you like Rachel? 
[01:37:30]  Why?  What's that?  Not that I don't like it, but you sound like Howard Stern.  Oh, yeah?  I don't have any respect for you because you sound like Howard Stern.  Oh, okay.  What have we found that sounds like?  You guys actually might be really cool.  Rachel.  Don't interrupt me like you do every other listener.  Hey, Rachel.  Don't interrupt me because you do it to every other listener.  Because we're sick of hearing that.  We've been doing this for seven years.  We've been very successful at it.  Okay, I'm not saying that, but maybe just recently.  The listeners in New York do not agree with that one bit.  Is it because we're talking, Rachel, instead of playing music? 
[01:38:00]  Okay, so that automatically just puts you in a rip-off category?  No, it should be Dopey and Anthony.  Oh, she's got me.  We've never heard that.  She was a hooah.  You could even take it the distance.  It's usually Dopey and Ain't Fun.  Ain't Fun.  Whatever, Rachel, you sound like a girl I raped in an alley.  Does that mean you're ripping somebody off?  Shut your stupid mouth. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know originally either.  You guys don't know originally either.  You're copying off of Howard.  You sound just like Howard.  Of course we are.  And then you bust them.  You have to know if you bust them out?  Shut up.  Talk about a rip-off.  You're a pig who goes down for a lobster dinner.  Why don't you die in a bus accident?  I'm sorry to tell you.  Shut up, you cheap stripper date.  Now, there's a line I've never heard on Howard before.  You cheap stripper date.  That's what she is.  I don't think so.  Rachel.  Yeah, Reese.  For dinner.  Shut your mouth.  You just have to try to bust people apart.  Shut up.  You're a filthy whore. 
[01:39:00]  We listened and you're babbling and you probably swallow for a creme belay.  I hope you die.  Hey, Rachel.  This is only you had so people.  Hey, Rachel.  Rachel.  Rachel.  Why don't you come up with me?  Rachel.  Rachel, can I ask you something?  You had so people.  That's how you eat.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  You say whatever you want to reflect the truth.  And the truth is that you rip off.  Oh, my God.  You say it like that to reflect it.  That voice.  Oh, my God.  Whatever.  Can you hold a man for like a week without him running? 
[01:39:30]  Rachel, who has to come home to this voice?  Yes.  Lots of people want it.  What sorry slob has to come home to that voice?  Guess what?  I look good.  I look damn good.  Oh, I bet you look good.  What sorry son of a bitch has to stick his manhood  so far in that mouth to shut you the F up?  To shut you up.  I don't do that.  I don't do that.  Of course you're going up, you skank.  Men please me, honey.  Men want to pay me to please me.  Please me.  So you're a prostitute.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I'd rather hang out at the gay pride parade, Rachel. 
[01:40:00]  You guys are complete idiots.  You're totally copying Howard Stern.  You're totally copying Howard Stern.  Hey, Rachel.  Rachel?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Are we copying?  I'd like to see what you guys look like, too.  Hey, Rachel, let me ask you something.  Are we copying Howard's show today or the one back in 1986?  Oh, whatever.  Stop saying that, you stupid broad.  Why were you busting a Howard Stern?  Rachel, I'm asking you.  Which show are we copying?  Were you busting a Howard Stern? 
[01:40:30]  The latest one?  The latest one or the one from 1986?  Which one?  Why do you have to even mention Howard's name?  You don't even need to mention his name.  You guys mention it, and then we defend ourselves, you twat.  What?  What?  What?  You have to say nasty things to other people.  Oh, my God.  Nasty words.  Why don't you shut up, you college puke?  You're a college puke.  I'm not a college puke.  Shut your dumb mouth.  Hey, Rachel.  Whatever.  You stink.  Rachel, keep listening, okay?  I can take this all day.  Keep it up, guys.  I don't...  Of course you can take it all day.  You're a stupid, abused woman. 
[01:41:00]  Shut up, you uncle victim.  Of course you can take it all day.  You crave it.  Whatever.  That's what you are.  Lie on your back and get smacked.  Shut your dumb victim mouth.  You see?  Oh, my God.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Daddy touched me.  I can take it all day.  Oh, my God.  You're made to be a victim.  You should be doing pornos.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Does it hurt me?  I just pretend I'm eating cotton candy while he's inside.  Does it hurt me? 
[01:41:30]  Shut your mouth.  You guys owe your whole career to...  Of course we do, right?  We got the last word in.  Pig.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  I wouldn't have minded if she shut up for 30 seconds.  Yeah.  It's just that voice.  Just a babbling whore.  She sees the dating guys that listen.  Yeah, it's a good point.  It's a good point.  Yeah, just to get in that nasty...  Yeah.  I don't do that.  I don't do that.  That nasty bung.  Awful.  You put up with that talk just to slide it.  Yeah.  And then it's just like... 
[01:42:00]  Ugh.  Why do they call me?  Why do they call me?  I'm smart.  Shut up.  I'm a college girl.  Let me go to Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey guys, on that Maxim list, you had the two guys under the umbrella?  Yeah.  Hey, Ope, when you were caddying, I know you had to hold an umbrella for some guy.  Ugh.  Faggy.  Later, boys.  Faggy.  No, you got me.  That's funny.  I had to hold an umbrella for him.  Faggy.  For many guys when I was caddying.  Stuck up rich guys.  You'd get completely soaked as long as you keep them dry in between shots. 
[01:42:30]  Ugh.  I hate golf.  You want to read some more of these, Ant?  Yeah, here's another one.  Okay.  When queried by a buddy's friend, girlfriend, mother, father, priest, shrink, dentist, accountant,  or dog walker, you need not and should not provide any useful information whatsoever  as to his whereabouts.  You're even permitted to deny his very existence.  You never...  When you get that phone call, you're like...  Hi, I'm Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah?  Um, do you know where Joe is?  Um, Joe?  Your brother, Joe.  Joe?  No.  I...  You mean my brother, Joe?  Yeah.  Do you know where he is or where he was last night?  Pfft.  I...  Joe.  Joe.  Hmm.  I got...  My cell phone's breaking up. 
[01:43:30]  I called you at home.  Oh, yeah.  Um...  You call on another line.  I can't...  Don't hang up.  That's how you got to handle that, because you're not...  You're not even sure if you say, oh, yeah, he was here.  Because he might not have said he was here.  You never tell.  I just used Joe as an example.  Not that that ever happened.  Hi, this is Rachel.  Do you know where my uncle is?  Uh...  No. 
[01:44:00]  He was supposed to be home to abuse and punch me in the face.  Just shimmy.  I can take it.  Did you look over your shoulder?  Oh, yeah.  There he is.  Whatever.  Ever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yuck.  Stupid boy.  Yuck.  Disgusting.  Five minutes.  Maximum waiting time?  Six minutes.  For a girl, you're required to wait ten minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic one to ten scale.  You'll wait all night.  You will just wait forever.  Thinking she's going to show. 
[01:44:30]  But your buddy?  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  They accept that, though, Ann.  Yes.  A best man toast must not include any of the following phrases.  Down in Tijuana.  Improbably booting out his nose.  Mostly scabbed over.  Or energetic Greco-Roman cluster F.  You ever been to a wedding where somebody gives a toast and they think it's going to  be cute to mention, like, I remember this time down in Cancun.  He was bees deep in a bunch of, like, hookers. 
[01:45:00]  Like Buscemi and the wedding singer?  Yeah.  And then the bride, always sitting there, knowing it's her day.  She has to smile, but you just see it.  It's a goody son of a bitch.  She's just looking at the toast.  Whatever.  Tony.  Norton, you are beautiful.  Nice, Tony.  Unreal.  Tony.  I'm here.  Yeah, no one with that.  See what I mean about the show thing?  What'd that guy say before?  I'm going, later, boys.  Boys.  Everybody could suck my me-hand.  Anyway, I'm usually the drunk friend that does all the stupid crap, but, like, what Anthony 
[01:45:30]  just did, that little fake phone call?  Huh, yeah.  No, I'm the one.  I'll just say, this is my excuse.  Whatever happened was bad, I did it, or I just said, listen, I was drunk and I blacked  out.  That's right.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I blacked out.  The code, more rules.  If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits forever.  Unless you actually marry her.  That's true, man.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  As soon as you make a bud, it's over.  You can't go after the sister.  Go after the sister.  Adam Ferrara did that.  Went out with my sister, though.  We waived the rule, you know?  And we still goof on him.  He's a nice guy, though.  Yeah, there you go.  Didn't you catch, like, Adam Ferrara was one of your best friends at the time, right?  Still is.  I love that guy.  But, I mean, at the time of the story I'm about to tell you, and he was going out with  your sister.  Yeah.  And then you caught him cheating on your sister?  Not quite. 
[01:46:30]  It was at a...  That's a tough situation to be in.  He's going out with my sister.  Actually, my brother was hanging out at a bar, and Adam was there.  And he sees Adam at the bar.  I think he starts making out with a girl at the bar.  And walks up and goes, what the F are you doing?  Oh, what?  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm doing this, that.  I don't know all the details.  But then it was pretty much over after that.  But he waived that one, too.  Legally, though, you can actually punch him. 
[01:47:00]  And it's completely acceptable.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  I think I got one for the list guy in the movie theater.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, you need the one homo buffer seat.  There you go.  We had gone into a movie theater.  It was really crowded.  My friend sat down next to me.  I said, what are you doing?  He's like, sitting next to you.  I'm like, no, you're not.  There's one in the row right in front of me.  Yeah, there's no reason you have to sit next to each other when you go to the movie.  The same thing with urinals.  They have a urinal diagram.  A diagram that's pretty damn funny, man.  You must take the urinal as far away from the other guy as possible. 
[01:47:30]  That's right.  If there's only a one urinal difference, you can have one urinal in between you.  There you go.  But never, ever can you get right up next to someone.  Unless it's crowded.  Oh, even then.  Unless you're at a jet game or something.  Yeah, maybe at the game.  But no talking.  There's no talking.  You can actually, there is a rule, you can kind of small talk at the urinal. 
[01:48:00]  Just, hey, what's up?  Not looking.  But once one of you is finished, you cannot talk to the guy if he's still taking a leap.  And you're in the bathroom.  You must leave.  Did I ever tell you the time an older gentleman hit on me at a urinal?  True story.  Absolutely true.  In a Parkway restroom, I'm coming back from a Rascals open mic in South Dakota.  Jersey.  And I'm there at like one in the morning.  And I'm using the facilities.  And an older gentleman comes in and goes about two urinals down.  And I feel looking at me.  You know, you just sense there's only two of you there.  And he's looking. 
[01:48:30]  And I turn around.  I look at him.  And he's staring down.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, I'm looking at the mule.  Yeah.  And it's lovely, I might add.  But there was still no reason for him to be staring at it.  And he goes, that's quite a pretty one.  Oh.  Oh.  I was so shaken up.  I actually said, thank you.  And I left.  What do you do?  I didn't know what to do.  You don't know what the hell.  My buddy laughing.  Oh, oh, oh.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  That's a pretty one.  Oh, oh.  That's quite a pretty one.  Quite a pretty one.  He meant it.  Frankie. 
[01:49:00]  Man rule 49.  Yeah.  In full detail, leaving nothing out.  Oh, no.  But coincidentally.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pierre.  What you're saying is you must disclose the aroma of the girl, let's just say.  But coincidentally, your wife, sharing the same anatomy, never smells.  Is that a rule?  But tell me.  You tell me.  Oh, my wife.  Oh, no.  She's like pearls. 
[01:49:30]  She's peaches and cream down there.  Well, you just don't talk about a wife.  Well, you never, you never ask.  That's the one thing that you never ask.  But at the same time, though, the one night stand, I mean, you have to lay out the whole  buffet on the table.  Well, that's sure.  Inside out, outside in.  Tell us what's going on in the trim.  Great.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  If a man zippers down, that's his problem.  You didn't see nothing.  You never say, hey, your fly's open.  Let him walk around until some other homo tells him. 
[01:50:00]  Stumble upon another guy watching a sporting event.  You may always ask the score of the game in progress, but never ask who's playing.  That spells homo.  Unless you're in prison, never, ever fight naked.  Could be very embarrassing.  On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the weakest.  Mm-hmm.  That's true.  Always the one guy that's got to take the leak.  And no one else has to.  Stopping up the whole trip.  That's my brother. 
[01:50:30]  Let me go to Anthony.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Alex, on the list, to say anything like when you're in the bathroom, or the public  bathroom doing your business, is it all right to talk to the guy next to you?  Talk to the guy next to you at the urinal?  Never.  Only if, ah, never.  What about if you're doing a crossword puzzle and you need help?  No.  You sure?  No, there's no talking.  No, you just stare straight ahead and get the, you know, what's, get it over with and  get out of there.  What about banging my French chick if she made the first move? 
[01:51:00]  Is that okay?  No.  Never.  Come on, that's got to be on the list, man.  We used to live by that.  No.  Here's the bathroom rule, Lofy.  Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you're on equal footing.  Both urinating, both waiting on line, et cetera.  For all other situations, an almost imperceptible, I recognize you nod is all the conversation  you need.  So if you're both taking a leak, I guess you could go like, ah, you know, hey, did you  see the chick out by the bar?  Keep it manly.  Seems to be the rule there. 
[01:51:30]  When receiving oral sex while driving, always wear your seatbelt, close the sunroof, smile,  make extended eye contact with as many women in other cars as possible.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man.  Right.  In fact, even remembering your best buddy's birthday is strictly optional.  Yeah.  When a buddy's trying to hook up, you may sabotage him only in a manner that gives you no chance  of getting laid even. 
[01:52:00]  Pretty much in his best interest, C-block.  When is it in his best interest ever to C-block, though?  Oh, she's got the herp.  Oh, that's different.  Something like that.  That's not a block, though.  Maybe, you know, she's got a huge boyfriend that's going to kill the guy.  Maybe.  All right.  All right.  I'll accept that.  Although I don't agree with that one either.  No C-blocking ever.  Well, if you're saving somebody from death, it's acceptable.  This is a pretty good one.  The fart rule.  Well, you may flatulate in front of a woman only after you've brought her to climax, but 
[01:52:30]  if you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of flatulent entertainment, she's  officially your girlfriend.  Before allowing a drunken pal to cheat on his girl, you must accept one intervention.  If he could get on his feet, look you in the eye and deliver an F you, you're absolved of  any responsibility.  Remember, later on, you will have no idea what his girlfriend is talking about.  Did you see the one about fighting? 
[01:53:00]  This is really true.  The third, fourth, and fifth rules of Fight Club.  If your buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to defend himself, you must jump  into the fight.  Exception.  If during the past 24 hours his actions have caused you to think what this guy needs is  a good ass whipping, you may stand back and enjoy.  Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing of your buddies, except when she's withholding  sex pending your response.  That seems to be the most important thing. 
[01:53:30]  Never allow a telephone conversation with a woman to go longer than you're able to have  sex with her.  Keep a stopwatch by the phone.  Hang up if necessary.  All right.  We got more to come.  We got to take a break, though, Ant.  Yeah.  We're running late here.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  O.P.  Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  Kids do all the talking for us. 
[01:54:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anthony Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Yeah, ladies.  Ladies.  This one's for you.  The horny people at Pinnacle, the makers of Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  They have something new just for women.  It's called Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Fan the flames of passion naturally.  It's a potent blend of all natural exotic herbs, including the legendary, of course,  Monkey Taekwonyin.  Yes.  Monkey Taekwonyin comes from the Fukin province of China. 
[01:54:30]  Sure it does.  They used to send the monkeys down, O.P., into the valley to pick the Monkey Taekwonyin  and bring it back up and keep all of China horny.  That's why they have a bunch of people in China.  It's from Monkey Taekwonyin.  And your women can get it in Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  It's great for romance and sex.  Remember the three P's.  Pleasure, passion, and, of course, Pinnacle.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Get it at GNC.  Or call them up 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323. 
[01:55:00]  Because when it's time to get funky, reach for the monkey.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  That was groovy.  Rachel's back.  Oh, come on.  Rachel.  Why'd you hang up on me?  Because we've got to move on with the show.  But no, sister, I do have a serious question now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is it dopey, spit, or swallow? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Can I answer that?  Yeah, go ahead.  It all depends on what your father would like him to do.  Uh.  You stupid, insane.  What is your question?  Since you said you've been doing this for seven years,  how come you're only in a couple cities?  Um, because we just finally got syndicated.  Because you suck.  Why do you listen?  Because you suck.  Oh, because I was listening to Howard Stern this morning,  and then I turned my radio back on.  Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.  If we suck, why are we going to be in...  You guys are losers.  I mean...  And then you cut me off. 
[01:56:00]  You cut me off so no one can hear me.  I'm going to...  Just listen to that voice.  I'm going to ask you a question.  You cut me off so no one can hear my opinion.  Rachel, Rachel, if we suck so bad,  why are we going to be in 20 cities by the end of the summer?  Right.  Well, let's see it.  Let's see it.  It hasn't been done yet.  So let's see if that happens to you.  Rachel, Rachel, we just signed our new contract.  It's only been...  If that happened, I'll call it apologize.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rachel.  Because you suck.  Rachel.  Stop interrupting.  You're going to just embarrass yourself, Rachel, okay?  Because as we speak right now,  we're on in New York, Philly, Chicago, and Dallas.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  And we're going to add Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio 
[01:56:30]  in the very near future.  It is great, Rachel.  Wait a while.  You owe your career to Howard Stern.  Rachel.  Rachel.  You owe your whole career to Howard Stern.  Rachel.  This is getting really old.  You know this, don't you?  No.  Admit it.  Rachel.  Stop crying.  The fact of the matter is we don't have a problem with Howard.  I know, but I'm just saying you're copying us.  No, we're not.  We're not, Rachel.  How is it copying, Rachel?  How is it copying, Rachel?  Because you sound like him.  I turn on the radio and you see.  No, you can't say sound like him.  If you get on the air and just talk about things that guys talk about, 
[01:57:00]  like we're doing, is that copying anything?  No, but you do the same kind of stuff.  Same kind of stuff.  Why?  Because we're guys and we talk about things guys talk about?  Rachel.  I don't understand.  We could list at least 20 to 30 things we do that no other radio host does.  Simple as that.  Now she hung up.  She'll keep listening.  She's a tip.  You know what she is?  I guarantee she'll keep listening.  Grobbling for the attention of men.  Right.  She needs to be heard because she is a put your head in the lap bag of meat.  And that's what you're good for. 
[01:57:30]  And nobody listens to you when you talk.  This is what sucks about going into the new markets.  Because people in New York understand we don't have a problem with Howard.  We really don't.  No.  We really don't.  We do two completely different things.  He's in the mornings.  We're in the afternoons.  That works great.  It works great.  We had a deal with this three years ago.  It's kind of weird that we have to deal with it all over again.  Oh my God.  Could you imagine?  Could you imagine just trying to bag that one and then that voice kicks in? 
[01:58:00]  There isn't a fluffy enough pillow to shut that face in that would shut that voice up.  I hung up on them.  Did you guys hear me on the radio?  Stop grobbling for the attention of men.  Stop it.  Here's tomorrow if she happens to make a phone call tomorrow morning.  Howard, I defended you.  I called up.  I'm robbing the news.  That's what would happen to you if you call that program. 
[01:58:30]  You know, if you don't like us, then just don't listen.  Right.  No one really cares, Rachel.  And if we don't get ratings, then we'll be gone.  We'll be bye-bye.  That's how it works.  She only wants to call in the morning.  She just needed something to talk about.  But like it or not, Rachel, we're going to be here a long time.  Get used to us.  New York did.  She's not too sure about those markets, Opie.  Should have better.  We get 22 markets or she gets 22 schlongs in a week in her face.  We have radio stations all over America that want the program tomorrow, but we're trying 
[01:59:00]  to spread it out.  It's quite frankly a little overwhelming.  So we're going to add one, maybe two a week.  I wonder what she does for a living.  We should have asked that.  Some menial broadcast.  Let's get back to your show.  Menial broadcast?  Yeah, she takes notes from, you know, dictation from a man.  She doesn't stop that.  Antonella.  Hello.  Hi, Antonella.  What's up?  Not much.  All right.  What do you got?  Oh, I was just listening to that urinal story that you told about the guy that said  that's a pretty one or something.  Yeah, Jim Norton. 
[01:59:30]  Old guy looked at his mule and said, you got a pretty one.  That's crazy.  I was just off to Seaport about two weeks ago with my boyfriend, and he comes out of  the bathroom.  Whatever.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  Sorry.  He's in the urinal, your boyfriend.  Yeah.  He comes out, he goes, this Mexican guy just passed me and looked down and went, damn,  God loves you.  And he was totally grossed out, because, like, some guy made a comment on his manhood.  That's a little weird.  Yeah.  Is he packing?  Huh? 
[02:00:00]  Is he packing?  What?  Yeah, well, sort of.  Maybe God loves him because he doesn't have foreskin with dirt under it.  Maybe that's why the Mexican commented.  No, he's actually really big.  All right, Ansonelle.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, there should be no compliments being thrown out in the bathroom as to your junk.  That's kind of embarrassing.  Hey, good way to get beat.  Hey, how did the pictures go with Allison? 
[02:00:30]  Very well.  Very well.  How many did you take?  Well, this particular computer clip holds 36 pictures.  I took 36 pictures.  36 pictures.  Get her back in the studio.  She's walking around in lingerie.  Our first contestant for the Moms I'd Like to F Contest, Anthony.  Are those pictures going up on the web?  Immediately.  They'll be up soon, right?  I want them up immediately.  Allison, how'd it go?  Good.  Did you have to preview your pictures?  No, I didn't.  No, not yet.  Did you, Rick?  Oh, yeah.  They look good? 
[02:01:00]  They look great.  All right.  I wish he was going to say that.  He took them.  All right.  More full body.  He's good.  He's good.  She's not our best ass contest winner for nothing.  She wants to get that tat removed, huh?  Yes.  What is that?  Everybody out there, please send me a quarter.  Put a quarter in the box.  What is it?  It's got the ex-husband's name on it.  Right on your ass.  Why the hell are you tattooed?  Why did you?  Because I'm an a-hole.  Your ex-husband.  I was, but I'm not anymore.  That's why he's an ex.  Yeah, but you apparently thought it was going to last a lifetime at some point, didn't you? 
[02:01:30]  How many people walk up the aisle and go, oh, I'll get divorced in about 10 years?  Happens to just about everyone I know.  Just about everyone I know.  Let's look forward to it, Rick.  Hey, I didn't get tattooed.  All right.  All right.  I'm getting screwed now, but I'm not getting tattooed.  Wow.  Yeah, because a tattoo's a bigger commitment than marriage.  Look, your marriage is done.  You're still tattooed.  And I've always liked the tattoos a lot better.  So what? 
[02:02:00]  Laser it off?  Laser.  You know, that technology's not quite down.  I mean, you're going to have a mark there that might not tan right or something.  We'll find someone to get that tattoo removed from you.  Definitely.  You can do that.  Come on.  You guys got connection.  Allison's the odds-on favorite to win this contest.  Moms.  Well, yeah, being the only contestant, I'd say our chances are very good.  Come on.  The other contests start like that, too.  I know.  All our contests start really slow, and then they pick up as the week goes on.  We should get some of the moms to call on the show that are coming down here later on this week. 
[02:02:30]  All right?  877-692-1027.  We've got a trip five days, four nights at the Sands Beach Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for the winter.  Airfare courtesy of Spirit Airlines.  Catch the Spirit.  Get great airfares at www.spiritaire.com or call 1-800-772-7117.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  All right.  And you know what we're going to do?  We're going to put all the lovely moms, their pictures up on the Internet, and then our listeners will vote for the mom they want to F.  Yeah.  What are the pictures going to be up of Allison?  Very soon.  Scott's working on it. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  He's just sifting through all the shots that I took.  All right.  You can go to www.wnaw.com to see Allison's pictures in a little while.  Sifting.  Oh, and Deb the Dyke sends her love.  I forgot to tell you that.  Deb the Dyke.  Oh, yeah.  Say hello.  Did she go to the gay pride parade?  No, actually, she didn't.  She came over and got her hair done instead because we were going to Vegas on Friday.  Have you ever, like, been with her?  No.  No?  No.  You just tease her, don't you?  Yeah, I enjoy it.  It's a lot of fun.  Wait, you guys are friends.  She's a dyke.  I've been doing her hair pride for many years.  And you walk around like this a lot. 
[02:03:30]  Well, not when she was.  Your daughter was saying that you show your boobs at the beach all the time and stuff,  right?  No, no, no.  She's lying.  Yeah, but you go around with a dyke.  I'm going to show my boobs at the beach.  You unleash that body around the dyke.  She's going to freak out.  Does she talk how hot you are?  She's seen me.  She's actually taking some pictures for me.  She's, you know, cool.  You know, it's like that.  Yes.  It's like anybody else you hang out with.  Like a steaming hot apple pie she wants to take a bite of.  My gay friends don't want to, like, bang me, so, you know, it's the same thing.  Oh, really?  All right. 
[02:04:00]  Let's go to Alex.  Alex, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  I, uh, talking about the guy code, right?  Yeah.  You're at a bar with your crew, and there's some guy always ducking rounds.  That's the worst.  Oh, ducking the rounds?  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody buys a round, and there's one guy that never quite ponies up.  He's like, he's like, oh, I'm going to the bathroom.  He's gone for 20 minutes.  Oh, you guys got a drink.  When it's his turn.  Yeah, well, sometimes you can't blame them.  Maybe they're just broke.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys suck. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Thanks, Alex.  Mendy.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Big butt, Mendy.  I just wanted to say I'm going to come down in a couple days, and, uh...  It's not called mountains I'd like to F.  Mendy.  Yes?  Why?  I know you guys love me.  But, Mendy, you know you don't have a chance of winning.  How old is your kid?  My daughter's seven.  My son is ten. 
[02:05:00]  I know I don't have a chance in hell of winning, but you know what?  There are guys out there who love seeing pictures of me.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Oh, you're so bad.  No, seriously, why?  Seriously, there are guys who...  There we go.  Come down for the manatees I'd like to F contest.  We've got to take another break to get on track here.  Oh, boy.  We got behind.  I want to play a lullaby for everybody today. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, what a touching song.  Well, we were talking about divorce.  Can we find that real fast?  Divorce.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  Yeah, we'll get that on the radio.  Two of your ex.  You're stuck with that for life.  It's like herpes.  She gave herself herpes.  Something she's stuck with for life.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Yeah?  What's up, buddy?  What's up?  Listen, I have this question.  Mike, call back if your phone is a little better, okay? 
[02:06:00]  Here's a Stephen Lynch song as we go to break.  This one's not on the CD because it's kind of a special song.  Is it, it's not on the CD because it sucks?  Well, that would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  Okay.  No, it's actually not, it's not a very funny song.  It's a, if you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced.  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12.  It's a short marriage.  Okay, okay.  How old are you?  I'm 27. 
[02:06:30]  27?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  And my wife of 16 years, Erin, divorced recently, and we have a little six-year-old girl.  And she doesn't really understand why mommy isn't living with us anymore.  Yeah.  I did my best to write this little lullaby and perhaps explain it to her.  I like the setup.  This is great.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm going to bring it down a little bit here.  You are.  Hush, little girl, sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight. 
[02:07:00]  Daddy's here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before? 
[02:07:30]  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Cause daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left us. 
[02:08:00]  It's pretty.  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight.  Soon it will all be like it was before. 
[02:08:30]  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his genitals oozing with pus. 
[02:09:00]  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I swear I'll try to be here by your side.  Right after daddy gets home from the bar. 
[02:09:30]  Visits his boogie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if daddy plays his cards right.  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai.  La-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai.  La-dee-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai.  La-dee-dai-dai-dai-dai-dai. 
[02:10:00]  Look at me.  I'm Megan.  Look at me.  I'm all cheered up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Hey, even Dice is tearing up over there.  Yeah, you got me, huh?  You got my sensitive side.  Yeah.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie.  Anthony.  Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Oh, yeah.

[02:12:00]  Pain.  Pain.  Pain.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Toll free.  877-692-1027.  Big butt Mendy's back, Anthony.  Ah.  Why?  Mendy.  Hi, guys.  Why do you guys hate me so much?  We love you, Mendy.  We love what you do for the show.  But you guys are always ragging on me.  I don't know.  It's almost the only thing. 
[02:12:30]  You're kind of annoying when you talk.  Like, I'd rather check out the pimples on your ass than listen to you speak.  I swear, that's the truth, too.  What are you doing?  Playing dot to dot?  No, when you call a show, you just kind of babble.  Maybe you get excited or something.  I don't know what it is.  But you just get really annoying.  I'd rather check out your naked butt.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's less annoying because it doesn't talk back to you.  Sure it does.  I don't know, Mendy. 
[02:13:00]  Do you get excited when you call us or something?  Because you just start babbling.  Well, you know, I mean, I try to say things and then you guys just hang up on me.  Because we can't take it anymore.  It's like...  Like you don't really say anything of interest.  It's just like...  Well, first of all, I was going to ask you...  It's okay that you're a big gal.  I don't have a problem with Mendy being a big gal.  I swear, because she does some great stuff for our show.  Yeah.  I mean, she horrified everyone at Mulcahy's and Wants on Thursday.  That's her job.  It was hilarious when that bottle disappeared. 
[02:13:30]  It was hilarious.  I love that.  Yeah.  But then to, like, have a conversation on the radio with you, it's just like, oh, here we...  Oh, oh.  Here we go.  Oh.  Well, you know, I mean, what do I have to do to be seen as okay in your eyes?  I mean, do I have to lose weight or...  No, no, no, I don't...  I like that you're fat.  I enjoy the fact you're fat.  I would vote...  We like exploiting your fatness in every way possible.  We love that.  Maybe if you come in with duct tape on your mouth. 
[02:14:00]  Duct tape on my mouth.  Yeah.  But then I couldn't talk.  That's okay, though.  You can still do all the...  That's the point.  You can still do all the fat tricks.  Oh.  Can I make a suggestion?  You know what?  Would you sit on a toilet, like, in a full metal jacket and put a rifle in your mouth?  You know, she's so bad, Norton.  Private Pyle.  You're all disgusting, fat body, Private Pyle.  Easy, Mendy.  Go easy, man.  And by the way, I have to say a big hello to my little sister who's down in... 
[02:14:30]  See?  See?  That's when we hang up.  That's it.  Now she wonders why.  Like, anyone cares about saying hi to her sister?  Gary, what's up?  Hey, why do you guys sound like you gotta stick up your meat crabs today?  I don't know.  Yeah, meat crab.  I don't know.  I don't know.  A lot of people attacking us.  No.  I don't think we could say that.  Why not?  Probably not.  Are they able to say it on TV?  Well, that's South Park.  They're allowed.  It's cable TV, and it's late at night.  I guess you can't say it.  No, no.  You can't even say that once. 
[02:15:00]  Henry, what are you talking about?  I was shitting down.  Gary, stop it.  Let's get together with my kids.  My kids hearing that word.  We have to hang up on Gary.  See?  He's going to keep saying it and saying it.  My kids are...  Uh, Vanjie wants to come in and say hi, right?  Vanjie?  Uh, Deb the Dyke.  Hey, oh, damn.  Wow, you don't sound like a dyke.  What's going on, guys?  Uh, hey, how you doing?  Allison, Nicky, hey. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, Norton, where the local girl's going to look at you, scrotum head?  Thank you.  Oh, jeez.  Listen to this dyke ranking on you, Norton.  How would you know what a scrotum looked like anyway, carpet muncher?  From your mother's dildo.  My mother doesn't have a dildo.  She hires Negroes to have sex with her.  You should know that.  Oh, oh, I forgot that one.  She doesn't like anything plastic.  All right, wow.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  By the way, how are your work boots and mullet?  Oh, I don't know.  Ask Allison how my mullet is.  She did it for me last night.  You have hair like a steel worker from Pittsburgh. 
[02:16:00]  Let me...  Look, Deb has a nice hairdo.  Oh, does she?  Yeah, her voice is a little funky, but she has, like, normal blonde hair and stuff.  Don't you just picture her in, like, garage attire?  Exactly.  Hey, I just got out from under my Chevy.  With a pack of cigarettes and rolled up her sleeve.  Putting in new headers.  I can't help my voice.  I mean, you know, I hear some of your straight women that call in that have some pretty rough voices.  No, that is the equivalent to the guy, the gay guy that is like, say, hi, how are you?  You know, with the gay voice.  You have the gay voice, the female version of the gay voice. 
[02:16:30]  You have that voice that's right in the middle.  You can either be, like, a 16-year-old boy or a dyke.  Yeah, I get the 16-year-old boy bit a lot.  Did you work on that?  Like, I don't understand, when gay people talk and they have the gay voice, did you work on that to get it?  Or is it something that just came naturally?  This is just my voice.  It's just how I talk.  See, isn't that weird?  It's got to be biological.  It's got to be like Giuliani.  Yeah, you're just like, hey, I'm a dyke.  It's a little masculine.  All right, ladies.  So, Deb, you just want to say that you and Allison are just good friends. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I mean, I've known her for, like, ten years.  It would be like kissing my sister now.  All right.  There's, like, no way that I could even, you know.  Well, you'd be on that so quick.  No, I wouldn't.  I couldn't.  It's like my sister.  You guys are hanging out on a Friday night and getting drunk, and all of a sudden Allison  says, hey, you want a taste?  You're jumping.  Nah.  First of all, she wouldn't do that.  No.  And I just, I wouldn't be able to do it.  She's too much.  She's like a little sister to me.  We've been hanging around for, like, 11 years now.  Stop it.  All right.  Not like guys, you know.  Guys will dig a hole in the ground, throw some hair around it, and jump on it, you know. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, who needs the hair around it?  Come on.  I love that.  Nice, tight little ground hole.  Little wormhole in the ground.  Why?  Stop it.  You're making me hungry.  Deb, are you angry at men?  No.  No?  What turned your dyke?  I've always been.  When you were growing up?  I was always a little different.  You're the tomboy?  I was a tomboy.  Tomboy.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah, she was a tomboy.  No, you're a dyke. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, basically.  When was your first girl-on-girl?  Girl-on-girl.  I guess I was 16.  Yeah.  She sounds like Butters.  I don't know.  If Butters gets a little older, Butters from South Park.  Well, I've been a dyke forever.  I don't know about that penis stuff.  Butters.  I love Butters.  Sorry, Deb.  That was okay.  I'd rather carpet much, but I've never seen a male thing or nothing.  Sounds like Mikey. 
[02:18:30]  Mikey the Mad Dog over there.  All right, Deb.  We're going to let you go, all right?  All right, guys.  Hey, take care.  Hey, take it easy.  You rock.  All right, bye.  There goes Deb the Dyke.  We love Deb the Dyke.  Hey, stop getting my period at 19.  That must annoy the hell out of lesbians when they get their period.  It's just a reminder that they're women still.  No matter how much like a man they feel, you're still a woman.  And men don't get it.  Ha.  Because God loves us.  Oh, Jesus, man.  Anthony.  Yeah, great news.  Allison's pictures are up on WNAW.com. 
[02:19:00]  The first contestant in the Moms I'd Like to F contest for your viewing pleasure.  Go to WNAW.com.  That, my friends, is a mom.  Oh.  With a let us take a look.  Oof.  How old is her big daughter?  17?  18.  18?  Oh, well, now I'm not going to be able to get it.  WNAW.com, our first contestant.  Here we go.  Ah, there it is.  If any other moms are coming down, I hope they call the show to let us know.  Wow. 
[02:19:30]  That's a mom.  Can you believe that?  You see the shot where she has her hands up against the wall?  Nice.  Wow.  I like the other one where she's got the head over the shoulder a little bit.  Showing off that mom ass.  You know what?  I think we should end the contest right now.  I don't think anyone's going to beat Allison.  Nope.  You go to the woof.  I think we should hand the trip to Myrtle Beach to Allison right now.  No one's beating her.  Well, we have to pay attention to the rules.  We've opened this up to people.  I'm just trying to get them, you know, riled up out there.  Go to the website. 
[02:20:00]  Take a look at her.  If you think you could beat her, mom, get on down here.  Come on down.  Anytime this week between 3 and 7, we'll take your pictures.  We'll put it up on the internet.  And eventually, the listeners will vote for the mom they'd like to F.  How did a head come through that?  Like, I'm looking right through there, and there's no indication that a huge, big baby  head went through there.  All right.  Look who's in the studio.  Vanjie.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up, Vanjie? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, I was listening to that whole thing earlier about the light-skinned people and the dark-skinned  people.  Yeah.  I think that that's disgusting.  Yeah, I know.  It must upset you as an African woman.  Vanjie, could you sit where Rick is so I can take a nice look at you?  I love Vanjie.  Am I the right?  You are the right?  Yes.  Wow.  Look at those guns.  Nice.  Hey, you know something?  I'm seeing, hold on.  I'm seeing some indication that it might be a little cool in the studio.  Let's just say that.  And that's nice placement. 
[02:21:00]  You've got some nice placement on those.  Yes, ma'am.  Are those natural, Vanjie?  Yeah.  Damn.  Look at you.  We've talked to you many times.  I've never seen that before.  Yeah.  They're huge.  Yeah, they are kind of huge.  You look like Cicely Tyson today.  Yeah.  Got a little Cicely Tyson going.  Not a young Aunt Jemima today.  Oh, we said that once?  Yes.  Oh, really?  That would be opie.  Who said that one?  I think you did.  I've said enough stupid things. 
[02:21:30]  You have some authentic African jewelry on, too.  Oh, yeah.  What do those represent?  The bracelet?  I don't know.  I just bought it.  Oh, I thought you would know.  No, no.  I mean...  It represents the beating you're going to get.  Look at...  No, no.  That's nice.  You're going to hurt somebody with that.  What's that made out of?  I have no idea.  But there's no idea.  It almost looks like one of the rings that they put around their necks to stretch them  out like the giraffe.  It does.  It looks like one of those rings.  Oh.  You ever see that?  I've seen that on National Geographic.  Oh, yeah.  That they do that.  I've seen that lately.  Where they stretch their neck? 
[02:22:00]  No, I don't know that I have.  And then she's got...  That's a good one.  Wow.  What is that?  You could punch someone's face in with that one.  Caligula.  Caligula.  Nice.  She's got the nice skin tone.  That's the tone I like right there.  Cafe latte or whatever.  Yeah, you got the cafe latte.  Well, what's wrong with dark skinned women?  I don't know.  It's just my preference.  That's all.  You have a dark skinned woman with straight hair.  Look at me.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like Wonder Bread White.  It would look funny.  It would look funny.  Is that what you're worrying about? 
[02:22:30]  I think you've got to worry about getting one first.  I tried for many years.  Well, you're worried about the contrast on the camcorder.  I can only get one of us in the picture.  Either the other one goes away and fades to darkness, or I'm way overexposed.  I can't figure out the contrast on this thing.  That must be a drag.  No happy medium for the Jungle Fever couples.  I know, trying to make their home video.  You've got to do something with the shutter speed.  You know what?  That is really fun.  Hey!  You never know. 
[02:23:00]  That's really good.  Vandy.  Yes?  You like the weed, though, don't you, right?  You partake in it, right?  Well, yeah.  Same time.  Vandy, you want in on our contest?  Have you had any kids?  No.  I just have cats, so I really couldn't.  You're a crazy cat lady?  Yeah.  How many you got?  Oh, that's not crazy cat lady.  You've got to be up to your knees and feces with dead cats laying around in the basement.  I used to have five cats.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  So what do you want to say about that argument we had earlier?  Well, it's, I don't know.  I just think it's disgusting. 
[02:23:30]  Because it used to be like that.  Like, guys used to like light-skinned girls.  Light-skinned black girls.  Yeah.  Because that's what we're talking about.  Yeah.  Like, the really black guys look down on the guys that aren't as black.  It's not as bad as it used to be, but, you know, I think that's kind of bad.  Because even you, Anthony, isn't there a thing like with the light-skinned Italians?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  So all races are like that.  No.  Actually, I haven't heard anything about Italians.  We hate everybody. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, huh?  You know what I mean?  Hey.  Not a friend who was Italian, and she said that I think the Italians from Sicily, the darker  ones, didn't like the light.  I guess there's a Sicilian and Italy thing.  Yeah.  But it's not to the point where you can't come together as a people and mix concrete.  You know, we overcame those, I think.  And, you know, I think you guys are still at a lack.  You don't have a strong leader. 
[02:24:30]  You do not have strong leadership to bring everyone together, all Africans together.  You got Jesse Jackson, who can't keep his thing in his pants.  He's screwing members of his staff.  You got Reverend Al, who's been tainted with that, what's her name, that hairdo, the jerry  curl.  And that, um, what the hell was her name?  Tawana Brawley.  The Tawana Brawley debacle.  That'll always haunt him.  Jesse Jackson, with his racist comments from the past.  Jaime Town, New York, talking about spitting in white people's food. 
[02:25:00]  You guys need a leader that could unite everyone.  And it always seems it's one side or the other.  You look at someone like Colin Powell, he's a liberal Uncle Tom.  And then you look at somebody like Farrakhan, and he's a militant black.  There's no one in between that can unite the black people to rise up, my brothers.  Oh, sorry.  That can just, I mean, really rally the troops and get some pride into the community and unite  people and stop the play of hating. 
[02:25:30]  Anthony, why don't you volunteer?  I am the new leader of the black people.  I'm appointing myself.  We don't have any good white leaders either.  No, you know something, though?  We'll just rally around people.  You know, the president gets elected.  All right, George W., he's an a-hole, whatever.  But you know something?  No one's rising up.  We go to work every day.  Do your crap, whatever.  You got to deal with it.  But you need, like, somebody that can really unite everybody.  You're the man, Ed.  That's got to be done.  That's the way I see it. 
[02:26:00]  Anthony.  Come up.  Anthony.  My new name, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony.  Right.  Anthony, come up to 125th Street.  I'm going up there.  Never.  Right in front.  I mean, it's nice up there now.  It's very nice up there.  It's changing things around up there.  I know.  Yes.  Yes.  So, in the building where Clinton's going to be.  Yeah.  You come up there and make your speech and say you would like to be the new leader to unite everybody.  And as I'm running for my life, I will give my speech.  No, it's not.  I told you it's not like that anymore.  I know it isn't. 
[02:26:30]  Harlem actually is a nice place.  It's a tourist attraction now.  Yes.  Yes.  They take people up there in the buses and show them the Apollo Theater and everything else up there.  I don't know of anything else up there.  There's the Apollo Theater.  What other historical things are up there in Harlem?  Magic Johnson has a movie theater up there, Ed.  Does he?  Look at me knowing this stuff.  There you go.  And I think they finally got a Starbucks up there, right?  Starbucks.  Starbucks.  Maybe a Gap store.  Only a Starbucks, Bucks, Bucks.  Disney stores up there.  Disney stores.  No Gap, though, right?  Old Navy.  Old Navy.  Old Navy.  The bros don't wear the Gap, do they? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Even though LL Cool J try to make it cool.  The G to the A to the P.  Right?  They don't wear the Gap, do they?  I don't know.  Yeah.  They do.  Yeah.  And Modell's HMB.  Yeah.  Well, got to go to Mo's.  I hear you.  Well, you get the good jerseys there and stuff.  And I'm Jennifer Convertible.  There's a lot of places up there.  Every day.  Jennifer Convertible's is the beds?  Yeah.  That fold out for the children?  Yes.  So they can stay in the living room?  Those aren't exactly tourist attractions. 
[02:27:30]  You know, you don't tell a bunch of people on a bus, watch them drinking coffee.  Jesus, Norton.  I'm serious.  As we round the corner up here, you'll see a Gap store, which is empty up here.  And here's the Starbucks.  Now we're going by the Apollo Theater.  Please now put on your Kevlar.  And we will roll past.  I'm kidding.  I know it's much nicer up there now.  Sure.  Sure.  Because if it was all that terrible, Clinton would have never considered coming up there. 
[02:28:00]  Did you hear about the contest we wanted to do and management wouldn't allow it?  When Chris Rock was playing the Apollo Theater, we were going to send one of our white listeners,  he had to be white, in full Kevlar, and we were going to get an armored personnel carrier  to drop him off at the Apollo Theater for the Chris Rock show.  Yeah, we were going to get an actual tank, an armored personnel carrier, and drop him off  to go into the Apollo Theater.  Right.  I watch that every Saturday night.  Showtime at the Apollo. 
[02:28:30]  That's right.  I do.  I watch it every weekend.  It's fun.  It's fascinating.  I love when the audience doesn't like somebody.  Oh, my God.  I start getting afraid, and I'm in my living room.  That's ugly.  Oh, my God.  They don't give him a chance.  We're going to drop him off in full Kevlar, though.  I don't think that would have been appreciated.  No, it wouldn't have been.  No.  Absolutely not.  We didn't understand why management said no to that one.  We couldn't comprehend that.  My buddy got booed off Keith Robinson.  He's a Philadelphia comic.  Yeah.  He was so flustered.  They're boo.  He's like, come on, y'all. 
[02:29:00]  I got to go home.  Hey, come on, y'all.  He was so flustered.  I got to face people after this.  He's telling me.  Hey, Uncle Chuck.  Yo.  What's up?  Not much.  I'm wondering.  Is Uncle Starbucks in home sell 40s or what?  40-ounce coffee?  40-ounce coffee.  Yeah.  Give me the 40 mocha espresso.  Yeah.  Let's sell 40-ounce Old English Catholic lattes.  Yeah.  Give me the Old English.  That's the Superventi.  With a shot of Champel. 
[02:29:30]  What's a Champel in?  Champel's always good.  Yeah.  And what was the...  Champagne and Ripple.  I call it Champipple.  Remember that?  That's fine.  You rock.  All right.  We should take a right.  How'd you get down here?  Taxi?  No.  On a train.  Oh.  Why?  Because the cab's hard to get in New York.  According to...  Who said that?  Right.  No, Earl did.  Yeah, we actually did a little contest.  We put Earl and the white guy out there, and Earl just...  Lost every time. 
[02:30:00]  Lost every time.  The cab would pull even past Earl and stop at the white guy.  They would turn their own duty lights, off-duty lights on.  And these are like Pakistanis.  Can we find that audio?  You know, that's going to be tough to find.  That was really funny.  No, usually females don't have that hard of a time.  Well, with the boobs you got?  Yeah.  Who the hell isn't stopping?  I don't know.  I didn't forget a cab.  Hell yeah.  Right?  Taking you uptown.  Nice.  Well, we have the Black Sea cabs, Anthony.  Oh, that's right.  Reverend Al. 
[02:30:30]  Reverend Al.  Cabs for black people.  When this...  Well, this was a couple of months back.  This was a big issue in the paper.  It was very hard to get a cab for black people.  Then they started cracking down on it.  Yeah, then they started really cracking down and sending undercover cops out on the street.  And if you got passed up for a white person, the guy was going to get a ticket or something.  Get his taxi license taken away.  But you see a lot of yellow cabs up there now.  Yeah.  They're not stopping, but they're...  They zoom right through.  What was the charge on the ticket?  A refusal to be shot in Brooklyn? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Brooklyn.  Worse than Harlem when it came to taxi guys getting shot and stuff.  Certain parts of Brooklyn are rough.  Yeah.  East New York.  Love it.  Nice.  And what is it, Bed-Stuy kind of rough?  Bed-Stuy, of course.  Who could forget?  Well, and as we go to break...  Yeah.  It's cabs for black people.  Reverend Al.  Blacksy cab.  Blacksy cabs.  From the ONA archives.  We'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show next.  Look who's coming through the door, Anthony. 
[02:31:30]  Huh?  Reverend Al coming through the door, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I think he has some commentary on the Danny Glover blocks can't get cabs in New York.  Does he?  I believe so.  So...  Well, where's his music?  Well, there's his music, and here he comes through the door, everyone.  Reverend Al.  Outraged.  I am outraged.  Outraged.  Where are the lesbians?  Who gives a crap about no taxi cab?  I can't believe that that Opie from Muskogee wouldn't show a boobage. 
[02:32:00]  What the hell's going on?  I don't know.  And Rick sounds like a goddamn pervert, man.  Yeah, he's shirt on.  Rick's more disgusting than the movie.  Hey, Reverend Al, you want to see some white boobies?  Well, I like to stick to my black sisters.  Yeah.  But what the hell?  All right.  Since she's here.  All right.  Let's see some dairy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Reverend Al likes that.  That's why Reverend Al likes coming here.  There you go.  To the Opie and Anthony Show.  But I'm outraged.  Now, what are you outraged about today?  Why can't a black man get a taxi cab in New York City? 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  Our own black girl had trouble early in the program.  Yeah.  Even your Reverend Al has been turned down trying to get a taxi cab.  I can't get to dinner.  I'm outraged.  Reverend Al's got to be fed.  Stop that car, you towelhead.  I am starting my own taxi cab service for the community.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:33:00]  Reverend Al's black sea cab.  Service in the Bronx in Harlem and certain parts of Brooklyn.  Unlike the white cab, Reverend Al's black sea cab will not be crowned victorious.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They are modified Bradley armored fighting vehicles.  That's right.  Where comfort abounds and they can take a few rounds.  When you get in, you get a message of safety from Reverend Al. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  Welcome, buckle up, and put on your complimentary flak jacket.  And remember, no shooting inside the vehicle due to ricochet.  Thank you.  Have a nice trip on Reverend Al's black sea cab.  See, the white folks' cab is equipped with, what, ample trunk space.  Your Reverend Al's cab, twin 50 millimeter cannons with tracer rounds.  And stinger anti-aircraft missiles to clear the way to your destination. 
[02:34:00]  That's right.  Reverend Al's black sea cab, our motto, the engine's loud and the paint is faded, but sit back and relax where armor plated.  So I'll be bringing those into the community very shortly if you send your donations to Reverend Al at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.  Thank you.  I am out raged.  All right, there he goes, Reverend Al, everyone.  Where's that southern hick bitch? 
[02:34:30]  Take your top off.  I am out raged.  There he goes, Reverend Al.  Boy, he's angry.  He's a little angry, Reverend Al.  I think he's more angry about the prude not getting topped.  Well, who wouldn't be?  Okay.  That brings the races together, doesn't it?  It's good to know we can agree on something, right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  Hey, this is Ron Jeremy.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  These guys get more girls in a day than I'll get in a month.

[02:36:30]  The sister of the lead singer.  The guy that sang Black Betty.  Is in the studio today.  Really?  It's our own Vanjie.  No, just kidding.  Allison.  Really?  The first contestant in our Moms I'd Like to F Contest.  Her brother is the lead singer of Ram Jam.  So, it could also be the sister of a classic rock star's We'd Like to F Contest. 
[02:37:00]  One Hit Wonder.  That was their only hit?  I think so.  It is a great song.  That's your brother?  Yeah.  Blood brother.  Yes.  100%.  How the hell did that happen?  Look at that.  Wow.  Do they have another song?  I really don't know.  I would have brought the CD if I had known.  No, like a song we heard on the radio before?  You know how it is with the One Hit Wonder.  The second song kind of sounds like the first one.  Yeah.  Whoa, Brown Sally.  Ramble.  Whoa, Brown Sally.  Did your brother get any money for that song appearing in Blow? 
[02:37:30]  Tan Betty.  No, they didn't get a lot of anything ever.  No, they never made any money back then.  Let's play.  Let's play.  Where are they now?  Where is the lead singer of Ram Jam?  Yeah, what's he doing now?  What does he do?  Actually, he's...  Spanking it to his sister's image.  Well, then I guess not.  He's a born-again Christian.  Born again?  Yeah.  Where did it turn from?  There must have been drugs and booze and everything.  Yeah.  Jail and all that.  Jail, drugs.  You don't just all of a sudden trot through life going all happy and everything's fine and go, 
[02:38:00]  you know, I'm going to become a born-again Christian.  Right.  There's always some kind of wild thing that happened in your life that makes you do that.  But he's still doing the music thing.  Yeah?  Actually, they're going to be going back with one of the old bands, the Doughboys,  that he was in before Ram Jam.  Whoa, Jesus Christ.  Ramble.  Whoa, Jesus Christ.  No?  Not going to do that?  Nail to the cross.  No, he's still doing good rock and roll music.  No, no, no.  He went through that little, you know... 
[02:38:30]  Got crucified.  Ram, Ram, Ram.  Three days he was alive.  Ram, Ram.  Whoa.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Do you want me to write that?  Holes in his hands.  Ram, Ram.  Holes in his feet.  Ram, Ram.  Well, tell your brother we said hi.  Tell your brother we said hi, all right?  Yeah.  And your pictures are up on WNAW.com.  Allison, the first contestant in the Moms I Like to Have contest.  And I must say, brah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, bo.  Thank you.  She's got the attractive dimper.  We like your doofa. 
[02:39:00]  Nice, sweet dimper.  And then by midweek you'll be like, wow, look at this milk.  Oh, screw Allison.  No, no, no, no.  Hopefully some other moms will come down tomorrow.  Ladies, where are you?  Give us a call if you're showing up tomorrow.  Great prize up for grabs.  I wonder if Allison likes it in da's doofa.  You ever, uh, no?  You never done that?  No, no, no.  Don't like that?  No?  No, it's true.  You want to try, Norton?  What's that?  Oh, no, I don't.  Norton's a pro with a digit.  We found that out on Friday.  Yeah, so I've heard.  He'll break in slow. 
[02:39:30]  You got any ice cubes?  Just stay over there.  Let's take a look at that doofa.  I love that.  Look at that.  Oh, wow.  Norton's drooling.  Oh, yeah.  He's backing up.  Let's, uh, yes.  Let's, uh, let's get into what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Andy, what's going on?  Well, I learned actually three things.  Uh, riots were started because they converted NYPD batty wagons into blacksy cabs.  Negro Abra went very well with the, uh, Dallas syndication, end it now. 
[02:40:00]  And Opie likes high yellows.  Over and out pools.  That was quite possibly the worst.  What did we learn I ever heard anyone say?  He might, uh, he might have wrecked the whole game.  Steve, what's going on?  Okay, terrific.  Hey.  Uh, first off, I learned it's all pink in the middle.  Yeah.  Right.  And second, I learned if, uh, if you run into an old fag in the men's room and he tells you  you have a pretty one, make sure to say thank you.  Yeah, there you go.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Steve. 
[02:40:30]  This is a weird thing going on in the corner here.  We got Allison with the hot A. She won the hot A contest.  Mm-hmm.  She kind of has lingerie and stuff still on.  Oh, look at that.  She's kind of rubbing her, uh, dupa into Norton.  And, uh, her daughter, the big one, with the big boobs, is kind of rubbing them, uh,  Wow.  Oh, man.  Barry Norton's face right in there.  There's some kind of mother-daughter thing.  Wow, look at that.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, remember, we had Allison touch her daughter's... 
[02:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, that is true.  We had the mother feel up the daughter last time, uh, you guys were here.  Remember that?  Boo-juggling.  What?  What?  It was boob-juggling.  She calls it boob-juggling.  She's a little...  All right, boob-juggling.  Sure.  Why don't you grab her like a six-pack?  No?  She has an ass like an...  Not my job.  It's like an eight-year-old boy without the, your mommy's in the hospital life.  I don't want to know what you know about eight-year-old boy's asses, okay?  Not what you're holding my asses.  Oh, dear.  I know.  Oh, it is, yes, sir.  Young William, just like it, not a hair to be found, yes. 
[02:41:30]  Jesus.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  I had pizza for lunch.  That new gag.  Wow, you are going back.  That's good.  That's good.  Um, I learned that Ram Jam's second breakthrough hit was, whoa, Brown Sally.  Whoa, whoa.  Just learned that.  Thank you.  Oh, wait, can I say one thing on the radio?  No.  Das Dumpar.  Uh, Brett, what's up?  I learned that LL's going to get some stank on his hang load. 
[02:42:00]  Yes.  Yeah, we did learn that.  Hey, Gordon.  Yes, sir.  Nice AIDS.  Eek.  Nice AIDS.  Oh, that made me happy.  Ah.  Ah, I got AIDS, Ramblin'.  Thank you.  Tony from Babylon.  What did I learn on the show today?  I learned, I was almost a fan of the Howdy and Anthony show.  Mike, today I learned Mendy's 10-year-old son is due next month.  Paul learned it's the Dopey and A-Hole show. 
[02:42:30]  That old gag.  He also learned that Rachel is a put-your-face-in-my-lap bag of meat.  And Opie's the A-Hole and Anthony is the good one.  Yeah, right.  Today, maybe.  Jerry, I learned if you're in over your head, repeatedly yell whatever.  Mexicans have dirt under their foreskins.  There's no talking at the urinal, even if you're stuck in a crossword puzzle.  And my favorite, Jerry learned if there's a hole in the ground, who needs hair around it?  Let's go to Joe. 
[02:43:00]  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  What I learned was the blacks are sick and tired of being racist against the whites in the cops,  and they're starting to revolt against each other.  All right.  Thank you.  That's nothing new.  It's just happening.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned that Norton's mom likes to hire a black man to have sex with her.  Nice.  Sorry, Dad.  I learned that Opie would rather check out the pimples on Mendy's ass than listen to her talk. 
[02:43:30]  That is true.  I learned that I would like to ram jam the milk contestant.  I learned on the show Norton has a pretty mule, and he learned Opie was saving it for the book.  I learned that tattoos equals herpes, Lieutenant Boogaloo.  I don't know. 
[02:44:00]  Don't bite me.  All right.  Mississippi should be walled off and bombed.  True.  I learned Anthony thinks Allison's daughter is fat.  See, Peter Stiffen is giving me crap.  Now, I never said that.  Pull the tape.  Pull the tape.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Anthony likes James from good times, and I hope he still likes Florida from good times.  I also learned that the virus has spread to Dallas.  That's right. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  Amen.  Our first show in Dallas.  I wonder how it went.  Hope you enjoyed it.  More of this crap to come tomorrow.  Hope you liked it, Dallas, Texas.  Let's go to Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What did you learn?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  First of all, you don't drive horses.  You ride them.  Norton believes the kids are the tool of Satan, and he's right.  And that woman who drowned her kids had the right idea.  Oh.  Ouch.  Necrob.  Thank you.  All right, Joe.  Thank you for calling.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Harry Harrison was on the grassy knoll on April 1st, 1998.  Harry Harrison. 
[02:45:00]  You learned wrong.  All right.  Look at that.  Today I learned not all radio personalities could kill off someone famous and end up in market numero uno.  And all the nice reviews coming in for Allison.  Oh, yeah?  A lot of people have gone to WNEW.com and checked out your picture.  And rave reviews.  Nice.  Thank you.  Holy S. 
[02:45:30]  That's a mom boing.  Give it to her.  No one can beat that.  I'm getting scared.  No moms have called.  Maybe they've seen Allison's pictures, and they're too scared to come down.  I got friends that are hot moms.  There's hot moms out there.  Come on.  Krista, what's up?  I learned on O&A.  Hey, Ben.  I learned that.  Oh, Ben Stalker.  Yeah.  What's up, Kristen?  Nothing much.  I wanted to say that I learned that nobody cares about Mindy's little sister. 
[02:46:00]  Mindy wasn't talking about her sister.  Yeah.  She said hi to her little sister, and you clicked off on her.  Oh, yeah.  You hung up on her.  You're right.  You're right.  Just like we're going to do to you.  Okay.  Bye.  You want to say hi to Ben, though, before you leave?  Of course.  Hey, Benny.  Hey, Benny.  A little Bainy.  Yeah.  Ben doesn't want to talk to you.  They keep pushing the mic away.  Oh, well.  Just have him thinking about me and Ben Nake and thinking about him.  Please shut it off.  Oh, no, Ben.  I want you.  Ben, she wants you, though. 
[02:46:30]  Come on.  How old are you?  I'm going to be 18 in August.  Oh, my God.  Barely legal.  Oh, my God.  Ben, talk to me.  Barely legal.  Come on, Ben.  Talk to Kristen for a minute.  I know we have to get off the air.  Just say something nice to Kristen.  Come on, tell me to at least jump in front of a bus.  She loves the attention from Ben.  Ben's not on the move today.  This is killing her that he's not saying anything.  No, I want to talk to my Benny.  I seriously do.  Not fair. 
[02:47:00]  Aw.  Come on, Ben.  Ben, she wants to talk to you.  You're going to have the final words on the show today.  Go.  I don't want the final words.  I don't want to say anything.  I'm not on the move.  You're going to get off the air anyway.  You don't like her?  No.  No.  Never.  I can't stand her.  Too well.  Let me hang up now.  Hey, can I say one thing before you hang up on me?  Yeah, go ahead.  Ben, don't go to any YouTube concerts because I'm going to be following you.  Oh, great.  Oh.  Go ahead.  Unfortunately, they left the country.  Wish you would, too. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm not leaving the country.  Thank you, El.  Country.  Wow, you sure cut her off in a funny part of her call.  You said country.  Of course.  You cut her off in the middle of country.  Yeah, I got good time.  Let's get out of here.  I want to thank everyone for stopping by.  Allison, of course, and her lovely daughter, Vanjie, in the studio, representing our Harlem  representative.  Yeah.  Looking fine.  Looking like Cicely Tyson.  Hey.  Thank you.  Looking real good.  Nice.  And Big Butt Mendy and everyone else that called in today. 
[02:48:00]  We'll do it again tomorrow.  Yeah.  And welcome, Dallas, Texas, to the Opie and Anthony family.  We call it the Opie and Anthony virus.  Yes.  Spreading to Columbus and Cleveland in the near future.  It is?  Yes.  Great.  Those are the next to go.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks, man.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Karen Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those things.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:48:30]  Hi, New York.  We're just talking to you right now.  Hi.  Wasn't Rachel a bitch today?  Ugh.  That hoe bag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just some of the things we have to deal with.  But we always come running back to you for our love.  We've got a couple pairs of tickets just for the New York audience to see.  David Spade at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center on Tuesday, July 31st.  Anthony, a week from tomorrow, right?  Oh, no.  July.  Sorry.  July 31st.  Is he going to do that funny bit where his housekeeper guy, he hits him with the stun gun?
