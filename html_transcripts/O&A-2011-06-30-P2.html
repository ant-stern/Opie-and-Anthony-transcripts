<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts announcing their upcoming Fourth of July break and a "worst of 2011" compilation for their holiday programming.  Anthony's enthusiastic consumption of Ben & Jerry's Boston Cream Pie ice cream dominated early conversation, juxtaposed with self-deprecating remarks about their lack of recent gym visits and nostalgic reflections on simpler ice cream choices from their youth.  They then recounted a disastrous interview with Dr. Michio Kaku, blaming Jim Norton’s unfunny jokes for the awkwardness.  The hosts also discussed a new Twitter account, "@sexbuzzer," created to monitor the perpetually late arrivals of their coworker, Eric ("E-Rock").

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing audio from a disastrous "after-show" hosted by Roland featuring former MTV VJs Martha Quinn, Alan Hunter, and Mark Goodman.  The VJs, unaware Opie and Anthony had left, endured an excruciatingly awkward and largely silent interview, a detail the hosts recounted with great amusement.

The conversation shifted to Chris Hansen's infidelity scandal, with crude jokes and listener accusations of Hansen's entrapment on *To Catch a Predator*.  This segued into further discussion of the MTV VJs' reactions to their own disastrous interview, interspersed with brief commentary on Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann’s political activities.

The show continued with a humorous, yet deeply frustrated, segment centered around the upcoming performance of the Beatles tribute band "Rain."  This involved an extended, increasingly absurd list of demands for the band, including stipulations about beards, hairstyles (no "mop tops"), song choices (excluding Ringo Starr songs and anything "trippy" or "obscure"), the number of band members (four, specifically), and even a left-handed bassist.  The hosts threatened to "pull the plug" if their demands weren't met, adding further ludicrous requests like a ban on nonsensical songs, "stump wives" in the audience, and a rooftop performance. The conversation included banter about Mark Goodman and other MTV VJs,  a Kiss interview on MTV,  and John Lennon's purported Republican leanings.

The Rain performance itself was met with significant disappointment.  Only three members arrived, lacking Ringo and the visual elements expected of a Beatles experience, leading to further demands, including a "Wall of Sound," no fake accents, no Yoko Ono references, and at least one left-handed musician.  E-Rock was briefly suggested as a Ringo replacement.  The hosts directed considerable frustration at Liam and SiriusXM for the perceived mismanagement of the booking, peppered with multiple "F.U." line calls.  A short animated segment, "The Spectacular Suicide," was played, followed by a quick interview with Max Weinberg.  Troy, in particular, vehemently criticized the performance, calling it a "fucking abortion," and compared them unfavorably to the Fab Faux.  A news story about a body found in a public swimming pool was briefly discussed before the hosts returned to their travel plans and their disappointment over Rain.

Following this, the show included an interview with Nina Blackwood, a former MTV VJ, who recounted anecdotes about her MTV career, including the Ramrod video audition, salary comparisons, and her move to Maine.  This was followed by Rain's performance of "Here Comes the Sun" and "Blackbird," and a subsequent interview and debate about their performance, compared again to the Fab Faux, with Troy Kwan participating via phone.  A wheel spin then selected Troy Kwan to host the next hour.

Troy Kwan's guest-hosting segment focused on the Beatles tribute show, his preference for original recordings, and ensuing caller responses featuring highly offensive language.  The conversation encompassed musical tastes, DJing techniques, and opinions on the show itself.  A significant portion involved a contentious exchange between Troy and Eric about Eric's tardiness and the "@sexbuzzer" Twitter account. This was punctuated by mutual accusations and insults.  A surprise in-studio appearance by Nick Cannon ensued, with a subsequent interview centered on past criticisms of his radio bits, his "fake" phone number, and his overall experience on the show, punctuated by crude humor and offensive jokes from a caller identifying as "The Fugitive."  Nick Cannon promoted his role at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  The segment concluded with the ongoing conflict between Troy and Eric.

The final segment covered Troy's concern for Eric's emotional and physical well-being, expressing worry about Eric's diet and perceived passivity.  The discussion involved heated debate about their friendship dynamics, strong language, and anecdotes about Michael Rappaport’s recent appearance, including a signed photograph and comments about Rappaport's perceived ADD.  The hosts also briefly discussed upcoming show segments and the impending end of "the wheel" segment.  The show ended with some seemingly nonsensical chatter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Today's most trusted name in news, the O.P. 
[00:04:00]  and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P.  and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  We're going to take a few days, right?  We're going to take a few days, right?  We're going to take a few days, right? 
[00:04:30]  We're going to take a few days, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Finally?  Yeah.  Finally?  Yeah.  The show's taking a few days, finally?  Taking a few days.  We keep this channel live, man.  That's what we do.  Well, you know what?  Around the 4th of July, there's parties, hijinks, shenanigans, and you want to be involved.  And that's what we're going to do.  So this is the last show for a few days.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, man, really quickly, I said it before the show, my wife goes and gets 
[00:05:00]  a few things from the grocery store, and she brought home some Ben & Jerry's.  Have you had Boston cream pie ice cream yet?  Jesus Christ.  It sounds lovely.  Oh, good God.  Oh, it goes right to my eyes.  I'm in deep fucking trouble.  Oh, God, yeah.  How much did you have?  I tried not to eat the whole thing.  Oh, no.  Did you eat the whole thing?  No, no, no.  Wow.  Do you eat more than you intended?  Yeah, because we were supposed to share. 
[00:05:30]  It is ridiculous.  It has a taste of banana cream pie.  Then it has pieces of yellow cake in the ice cream.  I'm looking at it.  And then big chunks of chocolate chips.  Is this their new fave flavor?  Hey, you just turned it off.  Yeah, you turned it off the monitor.  Stop breaking everything, Sam.  Oh, now it's on.  You want to try some Ben & Jerry's Boston cream pie ice cream?  It'd be nice.  Holy mother of Jesus.  It does look tasty, doesn't it?  It's unbelievable. 
[00:06:00]  I haven't hit the gym in a week.  I can't do it.  I know.  I just...  I can't do it.  Do you ever go a week without the gym?  I'm about a week and a half in right now.  It's depressing, right?  I get on my bike, but I need to lift some fucking weight.  I can't do that anymore.  But that Ben & Jerry's is...  They figured out this shit, huh?  It's fucking amazing what genius is.  Just throw hunks of stuff in there.  Chunks of stuff.  And it's always great.  Chunks of delicious.  It's tire rubber.  Wow, it's fucking phenomenal.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's a hunk of finger.  It's lovely. 
[00:06:30]  When we were growing up, it was strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla.  Would you like a little of every one of them?  Oh, sure.  With terrible pieces of frozen strawberry that tasted nothing like strawberries.  That's all we had.  Yeah.  Briars.  These kids have no fucking idea what they have, man.  We didn't have all these choices.  I remember when Haagen-Dazs first really took off.  And started trying to fool around with some flavors?  And people were just like, take your briars, take your fucking shitty whatever ice cream.  It was always the giant square box of ice cream. 
[00:07:00]  And that was the first one where it's like you took a spoonful of chocolate ice cream and went like, wow, that's some rich shit.  Yeah, that's some different shit.  And then the Dove bars.  Oh, yeah.  We're like, oh, fuck the Dove bars.  Yeah, well.  God damn, that's good.  Let's go get some Boston cream pie ice cream.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got to try this.  So it's, yeah, with yellow cake pieces, fudge flakes, and swirls of pastry cream.  I would literally have one spoonful, and that's it.  No, you wouldn't.  No, I would, I swear. 
[00:07:30]  No, it's one of those things.  No, I got great self-control with food.  No, you could.  Yeah, yeah.  With other things, you might lack it.  No, other things, I'm terrible.  It comes in a brown bottle that goes, when you turn the cap, it's, I'm over.  Why no self-control in that area?  I don't know.  Ice cream doesn't make you drunk.  It kind of does, though.  No, not in that way.  It kind of gives you a nice little buzz.  I'll get a big smile and start talking to everybody after ice cream.  You are a chatty Cathy after a few drinks. 
[00:08:00]  I certainly am.  I love a good party.  Oh, you certainly do.  Great party.  Ben & Jerry's coming out with new flavors?  Is this a new flavor?  Or I'm behind on this game?  And now we have...  It just looks like fucking Huddleston.  My go-to Ben & Jerry's used to be Cherry Garcia.  I don't love Cherry, though.  I loved Obese Primate.  It was such a great flavor.  That's not how I would say it. 
[00:08:30]  No, you said, Obese Primate.  Yeah, people in Connecticut were snooty.  Yes.  They wouldn't eat Chunky Monkey.  They would eat Obese Primate.  Come on.  That was a while ago.  You don't think that's a good joke?  Well, you know.  That's a lot of times.  When I first started.  It was 1990.  I was brand new.  You should have used this voice, though.  It's like an obese monkey in some prime.  That's a good joke, I think.  I think.  By the way, one of the most uncomfortable fucking moments. 
[00:09:00]  I listened back to that fucking replay with Dr. Michio Cocker.  I already forgot about that.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  And Jimmy just throwing horridly unfunny chip lines in.  That's got to be the number one bit this week.  And I was scrambling.  For the countdown, yes.  Scrambling to try to keep some kind of respectability.  You don't think the questions were good or well thought out?  It was so fucking hard to listen back. 
[00:09:30]  Yes, there was hay around the fucking hay around the thing.  But the best part.  There is Shima.  There is Shima.  Everywhere.  Shima.  Shima.  If you missed that, make sure you listen to the channel during the long weekend.  Brilliant.  You'll hear it, I'm sure, ten times.  What happened?  No countdown this week.  No countdown this week?  What do we got going on?  Oh, it's a special Fourth of July thing.  Yes.  It's the worst.  Is it Sam Roberts fucking takes over the station?  Oh, look out.  No, it's not Sam Roberts takes over the station.  What's our special Fourth of July program? 
[00:10:00]  The worst of 2011 so far.  So far, so it's a half year in kind of a...  It's our tradition.  Our traditional Fourth of July.  Yeah.  Do we have fireworks?  Sound effects and stuff?  No.  In between the bits?  No, we do not.  Any patriotic music in between the bits?  No.  No patriotic music.  Inspirational speeches?  Oh.  No.  No fifes?  No fifes.  No fifes music?  We want fifes.  Fife music is very patriotic.  I play the fifes. 
[00:10:30]  I don't like the fifes.  I like to get along with everybody.  Sis.  Sis.  I didn't even commit.  The best part of Dr. Kaku, though, was the only reason we wanted to talk to him was  to say, why are you not social?  Yeah.  And then it became what it became, which is awesome.  But then at the end, I was able to ask him, like, hey, you know, why don't you say  hi?  And he did exactly what Jimmy froze.  He froze.  He went, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you, so next time, you know, I see you, why don't you say hello? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Exactly what you said, though.  He reminds me of Alex's father in Clockwork Orange.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Oh, hi.  How you doing?  Feeling fit?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Oh.  He's all meek and scared.  That's him.  Frightened.  Frightened.  Oh, he was scared.  He was a little scaredy cat.  But you get him talking about science or whatever, and you know.  Oh, he'll just go off.  Oh, did you hear the stupid chip stepped on him, but did you hear the Pac-Man analogy? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yes.  It's like a little Pac-Man.  What is like?  It's not like a Pac-Man.  Pac-Man.  Doing what?  Yes.  Eating what?  Healthy air with its nuclear ugliness?  Waka waka.  Waka waka waka.  It's terrible.  Yes.  It is much like Billy Mitchell's pie.  What?  It was great.  I'm glad he's still a friend of the show, though.  Yeah.  He probably forgot that we hung up on him ten times.  He does.  It's like a goldfish in a bowl.  Right.  It just doesn't know.  There's no room for this idiocy in that brain. 
[00:12:00]  And it's so packed with knowledge that his brain makes decisions on a daily basis.  Because 99% is used up on string shit.  Yeah.  So the other 1% he's very selective about.  And this show is only there while he's talking.  And then it just comes right out.  Have a conversation with a cockroach, right?  And then really try to be compelled with what it's telling you.  Just, you don't care.  Do you think he forgets where he lives?  Like he has to hang on to that tiny little piece of his brain that has that knowledge? 
[00:12:30]  He's probably put it in some formula where he remembers through some kind of formula where he lives.  Yeah.  The two buildings are giant atoms and he's a little piece of string.  Yes.  Just theorizing.  He's a little piece of string vibrating around.  I bet he stood in front of your building before and went, why am I here?  Oh.  That's not mine.  And then turns around.  I am an electron.  And the nucleus is my building.  There he is.  Let me say hi to Chris in Michigan. 
[00:13:00]  Chris.  Yes.  Hello.  I really enjoy the EROC alarm going off.  And I was wondering if maybe you guys could add a Twitter account to that.  So in case somebody misses it, they could look at the Twitter account so they know when EROC actually shows up for the program.  Hey, man, a lot of people out there are looking for Twitter accounts to start that are a little niche.  So maybe someone will pick up on that.  What time did it go off today?  Well, we got it here if you want to hear it.  Oh, good, good.  Oh, let's hear it.  What was it?  Everyone knows the exact time now. 
[00:13:30]  What time was it at?  6.41.  6.41?  5.41.  5.41.  5.41.  That's still a little late compared to the rest of the crew, right?  Oh, for the rest of the crew, yeah.  But, I mean, for Eric, that's very early.  But he stays late.  I mean, yeah, but...  Right?  I used to stay early at the radio stations, too.  But that was because I was trying to get pussy.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  What are you trying to do, Eric?  You're a married man.  Stop running around with your dick out in the sales department trying to meet girls and get pussy!  Stop hanging out here trying to get pussy! 
[00:14:00]  Am I mistaken, or when we were doing afternoons, did we used to show up at noon?  Yeah, yeah, we did.  We'd come in...  Because we had horrible lives.  Because we hated being home.  Right.  So we would go to the station and do three hours of show prep, which was playing video games.  I used to play video games.  But it was a great hang.  It was.  It was fucking great.  All the guys would come in.  We'd just hang around.  Start drinking.  We would do two-hour lunches.  We would sit on...  Remember outside the Brooklyn Diner?  We would sit right up there on the stairs.  Oh, yeah, watch the girls. 
[00:14:30]  And watching all the girls go by.  Standing on the corner, watching all the girls, watching all the girls, watching all the girls go by.  Didn't we, uh...  Who's that?  I don't know.  It's an old school.  It sounds cool, actually.  Yeah, it's an old one.  I'm sure we have it in the system here.  Oh, it's probably one of the 40s channel thing.  Is it my imagination, or one afternoon, did we start holding up numbers?  Yeah, yeah, we were judging.  I think we did that one day and then realized that's really creepy. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it was creepy, and...  But it was a great spot for girl watching.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  And then we would go back upstairs, and then before you knew it, it was like, okay, it's showtime.  And then I would get sushi with Jeremy three, four times a week, and now the guy could barely nod at me.  Ah, you'd get maybe a hello.  Barely a nod from the guy.  And then after the show, we'd all go back to the office, crack some beers, smoke in the office,  and drink, video games, look at some porn, just bullshit. 
[00:15:30]  Some of the guests would come back.  And bring some of the hot girls back with us.  Bring the girls back to have sexual intercourse with.  Sometimes they would lez out in front of us.  It was great.  It was so great.  But then, now we get, you know, sex buzzer.  Sex buzzer.  Now we get here minutes before we broadcast, and leave minutes after we're done.  Because this has now taken the place of what our homes used to be.  This is the miserable place to be after the show, or before the show. 
[00:16:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, it's not, during the show, I love it.  We're in our happy bubble right now.  Yeah.  This is the happy bubble.  Yeah.  We're in the bubble right now.  All's good.  And now I just want to leave, like, right when it's done, and get to my happy place, which  is my home.  This is the biodome, man, right now.  Yeah, we're just in here.  We're just in here loving life.  In the bubble.  So anyway, we can't highlight this every day, or then it's not going to be a good bit.  The Twitter account's live. 
[00:16:30]  Who got it?  I don't know, but twitter.com slash sex buzzer is live.  All right.  And all it's going to do is tell you what time E-Rock made it to work.  Oh, and this person will really keep tabs.  Whoever it is.  Whoever it is.  I don't know.  It says the real name is Sex Bagel, so I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  I don't know.  See, the smartest thing would have been for Sex Man to have gotten the site.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what happened, but Sex Buzzer is the official Twitter account of the Sex Buzzer. 
[00:17:00]  If you want to keep track of when E-Rock shows up.  Yeah.  By the way, Sex Buzzer, you've got to get a picture.  Yeah.  You've got to get a picture on there.  I hate just the egg.  Well, they just got it, though.  They'll get a nice avatar.  Get a good E-Rock, like, looking distressed picture.  If you're listening to the channel before we come on live, all of a sudden you're going to hear a buzzer go off.  An obnoxious buzzer.  That means that E-Rock has made it to work.  Yeah.  That's the time he just came in. 
[00:17:30]  We don't know what else to do because this guy just doesn't want to show up at a decent time.  He's getting earlier every day, though.  I would say that.  It was 5.47.  Every day.  It's been two days.  Well, thus far.  And we have a six-day vacation.  Yeah, so he's going to forget about it.  He got in at 5.41.  What time did you get in, Sam?  I was in here a little before 5.  And Travis, what time did he get here?  Right around the same time as me.  Danny, same thing.  So there's a four in the hour number of when you get in.  He basically says, fuck you guys. 
[00:18:00]  That is a fond, a high and hearty fuck you.  Yeah.  But, I mean, he stays late.  Right.  That's what I've heard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess if you work slowly after the show, you don't have to come in on time.  That's interesting.  Right there.  So here's today's sex buzzer going off.  You want to hear this?  Yeah, sure.  Nothing.  I'm not saying anything.  Well, why not?  What? 
[00:18:30]  I can't see.  Damn it.  Oh, I see.  Sex bagel.  Why can't you say that?  Oh, you?  Huh?  Well, when you see the picture change in about two seconds.  I guess.  Oh, God.  Whoever's got the sex buzzer Twitter account.  It may actually be, Eric, because it says sex buzzer's location is Florida. 
[00:19:00]  Florida.  Oh, see.  We all know he grew up there.  Right.  Did you enjoy growing up in Florida, Iraq?  Yeah, sure.  Ooh.  He does not sound.  Wow.  Already 30 followers on the sex buzzer.  Wow.  Do you want to hear the sex buzzer going off today?  Please.  Okay.  So this is the...  As soon as Iraq enters the building...  Yeah.  ...we run down the hall.  One of the guys runs down the hall and throws a buzzer over whatever the fuck's playing on  our channel.  And this is how it went down today. 
[00:19:30]  It's all over.  It's hot.  Wow.  I got burned one time when I was a kid.  How worried are you, sir?  Well, right now, the wind...  ...are dying down at the present time right now.  It's not as windy.  Right.  However, the winds are unpredictable.  Sure.  That is such an obnoxious sound. 
[00:20:00]  Can we add to that obnoxiousness?  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean...  How?  I don't know.  Get some ideas.  Wow.  Is that bad?  Isn't that great?  All right.  We can't play that every day.  So when you hear the buzzer go off...  Yeah.  ...you're just showing up late again.  You know it is.  And if you miss it, it's twitter.com slash sex buzzer.  Sex buzzer.  Poor Iraq.  You don't look very happy back then.  I can't see because of the TV reflections.  All right.  This is great.  You're not a fan of the new bit? 
[00:20:30]  Oh, I love it.  Oh, boy.  That's sarcastic.  Let me...  You know what I'm actually going to do?  Huh?  I'm going to go to my Twitter right now.  Right?  I got my iPhone out.  There's my Twitter.  I'm going to go here to various accounts and whatnot.  There's my account page.  We're about to break 100.  I mean, they're about to break 100.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to put in S-E-X-B-U-Z-Z-E-R.  Right?  There it is. 
[00:21:00]  Sex buzzer.  Let's hit that.  And then go search.  And...  Oh, look at that.  Followed him?  Sex buzzer just came up.  How come I can't find a link to it?  I need...  I'll just hit save and then get that.  And I'll be a follower of Sex buzzer.  Yes.  Right?  Sex buzzer.  There it is. 
[00:21:30]  Sex buzzer.  I love it.  Also, yesterday, we officially broadcasted the worst radio ever.  Yes.  Another first for this business.  It was hard.  I didn't get to hear it because I walked yesterday.  So I wasn't in a car.  You heard Roland?  Yeah, I was walking.  Oh.  I was walking.  You heard it too?  No.  Was it not good?  Whoa.  It was so bad.  So bad. 
[00:22:00]  What's the show called after us?  After O&A Live?  Yes.  Usually Sam kind of takes that on.  But this week, we're having guest hosts.  Yeah, I don't know why.  You're spinning this fake wheel and then it lands on a name that you already decided on.  And what a surprise.  It was Roland.  And it was Roland.  You did guess that before the show ended.  I sure did, Jimmy.  I sure did.  It was an easier guess yesterday because there's already two names that have been passed on the wheel.  You do have a wheel, don't you?  Yeah.  How bad was Roland?  I mean, he was...  And you heard it?  Yeah, Roland was abominable as a host. 
[00:22:30]  In a good way or a bad way?  No, no.  It wasn't even fun to listen to at all.  Because sometimes really bad is fun to listen to.  Yeah, but it was the type of bad that's just bad.  Like, I couldn't even deal.  I had to change.  I know my Twitter exploded with people going, all right, bring Sam back.  I was happy.  They went, okay.  It was the first time I was happy I was in the tunnel at some point. 
[00:23:00]  And the signal just dropped out.  Oh, thank God.  Were you not yelling at your radio like, damn it, I love this song.  Why do I have to be in the tunnel now?  Oh, no, no.  I was like, thank God I could go to 88 and just listen to news.  Roland, what was the problem yesterday?  I don't know.  I suck.  What happened, though, that you sucked?  Because there was no energy to it.  No rhyme or reason.  It was just a bunch of guys giving him what options he had.  Like, what do you want to do?  You want to play a bit? 
[00:23:30]  You want to do line of the day?  You want to play a song?  You want to take calls?  And he's like, yeah, I don't know.  We'll do a bit.  I mean, no, we'll take calls.  He also, at one point, was playing a Blake Shelton song.  Yeah, yeah.  And said, oh, it's not playing it.  If you're talking over it, it's a bed.  And then he stopped talking.  Yeah, yeah, then he stopped talking.  Several times throughout the show, he had to be reminded that he wasn't talking.  Yeah, you had to prod him like, hey, you're not talking.  This is a show.  You've got to talk. 
[00:24:00]  I had one of those off days, as they say.  It was an off day, was it?  And then a little shit story here, got me some guests.  Who?  Why are you booking guests in the 10 o'clock hour?  I know.  Because they're not on before.  They can't come on before 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock hour is just supposed to be a recap.  We still want to get them on the channel.  So, you know.  It was a couple of the very well-known old MTV VJs.  Very, very angry, too. 
[00:24:30]  They were angry, right?  Why were they angry?  They go, where's Opie and Anthony?  I'm like, they're gone.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, they're not here.  And they're like, well, we were asked to rush down here.  And, you know, where's Opie and Anthony?  Oh, they leave at 10.  This is like the after show.  So they felt bamboozled.  Who are they?  Is it Martha Quinn?  Martha Quinn, who I hear still looks very cute.  Really?  Is she?  Yeah.  That's impossible.  Is she bitchy?  Oh, yeah.  Well, she.  Wait, why do you say that? 
[00:25:00]  I fucking miss this.  Damn it.  Because she turned into, like, really nice and then turned into, like, a little cunt-a-roo  for a minute.  She didn't like the idea of being dragged down here.  No, her face and everything.  Her body.  Like, oh, no, no, no, no.  Do we have audio?  She was like, oh, God, I got dragged down here.  She's not important enough for us to hang around and talk to her about 80s music.  Well, the problem was nobody was talking to her.  She came in here and she looked at the host of the show, which was Roland.  I was standing up and so.  You didn't ask them to sit down.  Yeah.  The chairs, they can sit down.  And they can sit down if they fucking want.  Now, you know what? 
[00:25:30]  Let me tell you something.  I listened to it and they were under the guise that we were going to be here.  Now, this isn't just them dropping by and saying, hey, we're important.  Opie and Anthony should be here.  It's they were told we were going to be here.  So when they didn't see us, they got a little annoyed.  Let's say, for a fact, we were going to be on a show.  We were booked to be on maybe David Letterman.  They're like, quick, come on down.  Do Letterman.  And you walk in and Letterman's not there.  It's like an intern is sitting behind the desk.  Bill Tetley is behind the desk. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but your argument sucks.  You're still on the David Letterman show and a lot of people are seeing it.  No, no.  A lot of people were listening yesterday.  No one knows how it works.  Yeah, it might be on and you'd be sitting there.  I say, fuck them.  Really?  Yes.  Alan Hunter was excited.  He pulled the camera and like panning.  Like, where's opening it?  Who else came?  Martha and who else?  Alan Hunter and J.J. Jackson.  The grumpy Mark Kirby.  Oh, that's right.  There's three of them?  I would have loved to have fucking met three of those guys.  Oh, no.  Mark Goodman.  I'm sorry.  Mark Goodman. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, Mark Goodman.  He was an angry one, too.  It was also...  Say?  Is he angry because he still has to deal with fucking being stuck in the 80s?  Or a bad facelift.  I don't know.  Oh, jeez, bro.  Fuck those guys.  Oh, wow.  What have they done since the 80s?  Except relive it over and over again.  What?  They're supposed to be back today around 1 or something.  Why don't we hear the audio before we kill them?  Because they might have been...  Oh, no.  No, they had all the right to.  Yeah.  And you can't hear it in the audio, but after I introduced them, I brought them in, but  it was Roland's show.  Roland's show.  And Roland kept saying, well, Sam's the host, so I left. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  You have to leave.  Because I wasn't going to...  Because he's going to depend on you.  Give him the stick.  Yeah.  It was Roland's time, not my...  It was his show.  Talked among themselves.  They knew each other.  They were really mad, huh?  Yeah.  When I said talked among themselves, I was just like, stay there.  It's a compliment.  They came in to meet Opie and Anthony, and Roland was there, and they were like, what  the fuck?  I know.  Yeah.  That's how I felt when I heard it.  I mean, they were a big deal when I was growing up, but we'd certainly surpassed them  in our careers.  Well, you know, they're icons. 
[00:27:30]  They're icons.  Yeah.  Three of them.  That's pretty cool.  What were they doing?  A special?  Yeah.  Their mistake was thinking that the 80s would be important forever.  Yes.  How about you move forward a little bit?  I don't know.  I'll still watch an episode of Family Ties.  Yeah, me too.  Well, it's nice to see him hold that iced tea without spilling it on the rug.  Oh, shit.  He shakes.  Of course he does.  All right.  Well, here's Roland from the After Show, After ONA Live, interviewing the original VJs. 
[00:28:00]  A few of them.  Who knew Alex P. Keaton, the piece stood for Parkinson's.  Bad coincidence.  And wait, was one of them dead?  I mean, Martha.  Yeah, we lost JJ.  JJ Johnson's dead?  JJ Jackson.  Jackson, I'm sorry.  And Nina Blackwood came in later.  Nina Blackwood was fucking sexy, man.  Wait, Nina was one of the originals, huh?  Yeah, she was.  I thought she was.  Oh, she definitely was.  Yeah, that's right.  Why you said...  She came in like around three o'clock.  Oh, I thought you meant she came in later as far as MTV goes. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I thought she was one of the originals.  She was in Vice Squad, which was a cool movie.  She got beaten to death by Wings Houser.  Wings Houser.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, come on, Ginger.  Open the...  Like, she was a fucking hooker who had stolen money from her pimp.  And he's like, come on, let me in.  Yeah.  And she opens the door and then he fucking grabs her head.  He goes, I cannot believe how stupid you are.  I cannot believe how stupid you are.  And he fucking, uh, he tied her up. 
[00:29:00]  And she knows she's going to get a fucking beating.  A sound thrashing.  And he says, you're not going to be able to get my moneymaker away for a long time.  Oh, shit.  And then he beats her to death and that's the fucking push of the movie.  Who is it?  Season Hubbly, I think.  Am I wrong?  Is it Season Hubbly?  Season Hubbly?  Uh, was the hooker who wants to fucking avenge your death?  Really?  I have no idea.  Fred Berry is in it.  Fred Berry?  He plays a sugar pimp named Dorsey who gets stabbed in the cock with a fucking, uh, with 
[00:29:30]  a switchblade.  Wings Houser goes, you know what the problem with you, sugar pimps?  You ain't got no balls, boy.  And he jabs it and you hear, oh!  I gotta see that again.  Yeah, fucking Vice Squad.  I haven't seen that in a long ass time.  Very cheesy, but it's good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't hold up, but that's even better.  Roland didn't talk to Nina, unfortunately.  No.  But you talked to Alan Hunter.  Barely talked to any of them.  Martha Quinn.  No.  Mark Goodman.  Yeah.  All right.  This is from the, uh, I have to show you yesterday.  Roland, I think we have some guests. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, who are they?  You want to come on in?  Who are they?  The original MTV VJs, Roland, just for you.  Oh.  Come on in.  Oh, they can talk.  Come on in.  Everybody grab a mic.  Uh, do we have to?  You want us to grab?  Come on, you know, actually.  Okay, move over here.  Yeah.  Here, you can move this one.  I'll switch.  All right, what are we doing?  Hey, man.  How are you?  This is where, where, this is after Opie and Anthony live, and Roland is the guest host  today.  I don't want to do it.  What do you think you don't want to do it?  Wow, perfect.  I just booked the guest, and I'm awful on the air. 
[00:30:30]  And now you get stuck with it, man?  Yeah.  It sucks.  It does suck on people.  I say we bail on him.  Let's talk about how sucky that is.  Let's leave him to his own.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I like that.  Roland, you have legends in the studio.  Will you talk to him?  This is your show.  It's your show now.  I'll tell you what.  If you don't know everything about our past, I mean, you're fucked right now.  I grew up watching you guys, but then I blank out, though.  Talk about it.  I smell him.  He gets nervous.  Let's do it, my friend.  All right.  Why don't we just interview each other on the show?  There you go.  So, Mark, what have you been up to lately? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, gosh, Al.  How about you?  I'm just going to film all of this, if you don't mind.  Fill everybody in.  Tell me, have you done video for your new album?  Yeah, right.  No, we're going back.  That was question number seven.  We're going retro.  Have you done video?  We're going to do stills, 24 frames per second.  It's crazy.  It's a crazy idea.  It's a second-long video.  It's only a second.  It's not a new concept.  It embeds in your brain.  It's all good.  That's fine.  Take over.  Thank you, everybody. 
[00:31:30]  Good night.  All right.  It's been good.  Because usually...  Ah, Sam.  Wait, that was magic, man.  I know.  No, usually Sam's supposed to host it, but he makes one of us host for this week, which  is awful.  So, where are Opie and Anthony?  Where are they?  Are they gone?  They're on their way home right now.  Really?  They're on vacation?  No, they leave at 10 o'clock.  Oh, they're done.  So, I'm confused.  It's an urgent message.  You have to go to Opie and Anthony right now before they leave, and they hustled us  down here.  Oh, I have no idea.  And we find one guy going, oh, I don't want to interview you. 
[00:32:00]  It's kind of confusing.  No, no.  At 10 o'clock, they run home.  They're done.  I'll tell you this.  I need to just go for it.  Yeah, you go for it.  Yeah, this might not be.  Yeah, we're in the middle of doing something down the hall, and we just said, come on down.  They said, come on down here real quick, but I might just get out of your hair here.  Yeah.  I think they did that just to torture me.  No problem.  No, look.  It was good.  That was a great interview.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  No problem.  That was, like, the best ever.  No worries.  Do a good job, my friend.  Oh, thanks.  It's all good.  Bye.  Later.  Now you can have your life back.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  That's great.  That is uncomfortable, man.  I thought you said it wasn't good.  That's great to listen to.  They were all just staring at me like Mark Goodman.  And Roland spins it like I was trying to torture him by, okay, Roland has nothing to do on 
[00:33:00]  this show.  I'm going to book him a guest.  So that way, at least he'll have a guest.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he just stares at the guest and says, you guys just talk amongst yourselves.  I just booked the show.  But they couldn't even do that.  Because in the end, all they do is intro music.  But also, Roland said, I don't want to be here.  I don't want to talk to you guys.  It was insulting.  Yeah.  That's great.  You insulted that.  That's the thing about the Roland out, where at first, Anthony was right.  He called in even and said, this is horrible.  It's not even so bad.  It's good.  But the thing is, because it went on for the full hour, eventually it was like, all right, 
[00:33:30]  I'm on board.  It was so bad.  That's so uncomfortable.  I could listen to that all day.  All right.  And then they were walking around the hallways all day long.  Really?  Hoping someone wanted to talk to them?  No, I just walked by them.  About the 80s?  And she was like, eh.  So mad at you?  Yeah, she had flashbacks.  What?  Um, because I walked by her in the afternoon, like, hi.  She was like, eh.  I actually thought Roland would do, like, all right.  You were wrong. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, that was just really, and Roland didn't even know how to, like, like, while they were  leaving, you'd think Roland would have said something like, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, sorry.  Anything.  Or how about, like, hey, guys, look, look, look.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm not experienced at this.  If you come back in, take a seat, we'll hash this out.  Ooh, that's good.  Or, like, Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, that's good.  No.  Opie and Anthony aren't here.  This is the after show.  But tell me.  So you guys are done with them?  And then start the conversation going anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're like, oh, whatever.  So, yeah, what are you doing here? 
[00:34:30]  Obviously, you do the, uh.  I've never heard someone be mad and feel sorry for someone at the same time.  That's what went on there.  Because then one of them said, well, you could have your life back now.  Have your life back.  I didn't want to say Carson, say you're an asshole.  And that was, but that was pretty much a, when they said you could have your life back,  that was pretty much a, now we can leave and get our lives back.  I mean, they said, we're going to go do some work.  And then Roland said, all right, go for it.  Yeah.  Go for it. 
[00:35:00]  Like, hey, thanks for stopping in.  Nothing.  Carson?  No.  Like, Bob Hope would just drop in and wave and leave?  What the fuck is it?  But then they left and it was just silence.  It was just Roland.  Oh, yeah, just uncomfortable silence.  Like, callers were even, it got to the point where callers were actually trying to help,  which they never do.  Yeah, yeah, they never do.  And they called up and they'd be like, Roland, tell me about yourself.  How'd you get the job?  Do you have a girlfriend?  Do you still live with your parents?  And Roland would respond, no, I don't live with my parents.  No, I don't have a girlfriend. 
[00:35:30]  I used to work in talent booking.  Next call.  Well, I was home.  Hey, I had a job with you guys before.  And then, that's what I was listening to.  I was staring at my radio like, no, no, this isn't happening.  Yeah, it was frightening to listen to.  We're going to do away with the wheel after this week, but I committed to a week.  The chattery, chattery, clackety-clack of the wheel, by the way. 
[00:36:00]  You don't like it?  Because I knew Roland was the guy.  Eric.  And then they pulled shenanigans.  Can you spin the wheel just to prove that we have it?  Yeah, let me go get it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eric's got to go grab it.  We actually had to spin it twice yesterday.  Yes, because it landed on somebody that had already done.  Oh, really?  Which was a clever ruse.  That's some trickery.  Because I was like, wait a minute.  We all know it's going to be Roland.  It was supposed to be Roland.  It's like, oh, it landed on somebody that already did a show.  So let's spin it again.  And then it was like, click, click, click, click, click.  Oh, it's Roland. 
[00:36:30]  Who's the random person today?  I will say, you never know where the wheel is going to land.  Oh, well, of course.  But Troy has gone through the last three nights doing DJ gigs at night without sleeping.  So hopefully it won't land on Troy.  Because he'll probably not be good because he's tired.  He's going to sound like an asshole today.  He's going to be drinking Red Bulls today and stuff.  It's going to be weird.  You weren't that bad.  Oof.  Oof.  They were just staring at me.  Oof.  Eric's got the wheel out if you want to hear it.  Sure.  Oh, the wheel is finally out. 
[00:37:00]  Spin that shit.  Just spin it.  It's not moving.  Why aren't you spinning it?  It's not moving.  It's got to get greased up.  Oh, it's got to be oil.  WD-40.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  E-Rock's spinning?  Did you forget to put the attachment on?  Only E-Rock could not spin this wheel.  Here it goes.  That's great.  Where's the wheel?  I can't see it.  It's short.  It's under the desk.  It's over here.  It's very heavy.  Sounds like E-Rock's apnea. 
[00:37:30]  Poor kid.  He's just in there trying to spin a wheel.  And it landed on Bobo.  What does that do?  Does Bobo come in now and do a show?  He's kind of banned from everything.  Oh, that's a shame.  We're booked up until December.  Oh.  All right, Roland.  I don't know what to say about that.  I don't know how I feel about the MTV VJs.  I mean, I will say that Roland had the callers lit the entire hour.  Oh, yeah.  The phone screen was lit the entire hour. 
[00:38:00]  With people screaming, get the fuck off the radio.  Yep.  Yeah.  Steve Sturdiolo came in and helped him out a little bit.  Sturdiolo.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  It was like the phone show.  Was it?  No.  Roland goes, no.  Yeah, and there'd almost be an argument between Roland and somebody else.  And then just as it was heating up, Roland would just kind of trail off and go, yeah,  you're right.  Let's go to a call.  Yeah, right.  Let's just book this show.  I don't care.  Oh, and he kept playing Blake Shelton songs, too. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I didn't like that at all.  He was trying to get the Southern listeners on his side.  And then I heard some Bruce being played.  And then you were like, yeah, this is for the big man.  I'm like, that's done.  I realized that later.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah.  What was Bruce's quote about Clarence Clemens at the wake?  Or at the eulogy, whatever?  Something they want to have the big man on the side after 40 years.  No, that wasn't it.  Oh, I don't know.  Did he say something about Clarence Clemens leaves the E Street Band when we all die? 
[00:39:00]  But he's not in it.  Yeah.  Is he going to be a zombie?  He's just sitting there all chewed up, playing his dumb saxophone.  He hasn't left the E Street Band until we all have died.  He'll be up there with them in spirit.  Is that what he was saying?  Yeah, that's what Springsteen said.  You should know that, being the big working class t-shirt wearing Springsteen guy.  Here's what I think, by the way. 
[00:39:30]  And I know he's got, what, Clarence's son or nephew or something playing.  But there will be a point.  When is he touring?  It's supposed to be the fall.  Okay, fall.  The first time he goes out, right, they're going to play a song.  And Clarence is supposed to be doing the sax.  Maybe the nephew will do it offstage, and there's just going to be a single spotlight on an empty part of the stage.  They did it for Danny.  What? 
[00:40:00]  For the other guy.  Danny Ross?  When he left the country over here?  Danny Partridge?  Yes, I worked for him.  They did it for Danny.  Federici.  Yeah?  For when they did Sandy, which is a spotlight in his, that piano thingy.  He goes, woo-woo-woo.  Was just sitting there?  Piano thingy.  I love how he goes, woo-woo-woo-woo.  The piano thingy that goes, woo-woo-woo.  Why didn't you do this in the after show?  Would that be an accordion?  There you go.  All right.  See, this should be the after show.  Yeah, accordion to the report that something's going on. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, the spotlight on the accordion?  Yeah.  That's why his brother played Sandy.  See, they're going to do the same fucking thing.  I didn't even know they did that.  I just pictured Bruce doing some cheesy-ass thing like that.  I think they're going to go different.  What do you think?  Clarence Clemens on the video screen, and Bruce Springsteen playing with the tape.  Playing to the big tape thing.  That's another one they like to do.  That would be a big one.  Okay, I can see that.  There's a close-up on Clarence Clemens doing his solo. 
[00:41:00]  And the crowd just goes, bullshit.  You think Bruce will say, take it away, big man!  Yeah.  And everyone will be like, what?  He's gone.  How can he take it away?  And then all of a sudden, the screen shows Clarence Clemens.  And the place goes, bullshit!  He looks in the camera and goes, I'm dead!  Motherfucker.  And everyone goes, yeah, motherfucker!  Take it away, big man!  And they throw like a referee flag.  Yeah!  It's going to be dramatic like that, and then he'll be on the screen.  Yep.  Taped.  I think you're right.  And then they'll go back to the live.  That's a good one.  And you'll see Bruce in the shot on the screen wearing a different outfit than he's wearing 
[00:41:30]  that night.  It will look weird.  Yeah.  And be like, why is that?  Yeah.  Why don't we let it go?  He played the horn.  Let's move on.  The horny horn.  How many?  398 followers on Sex Buzzer?  Sex Buzzer.  I'm proud to say I'm one of them, by the way.  Yeah.  I am a follower.  I'll follow.  With one tweet and following nobody.  398 followers in no time at all.  Why?  What's funny?  Look at the picture of whoever chose.  Roland, why are you laughing? 
[00:42:00]  It's that E-Rock picture.  Why is he laughing?  You can't just ignore this.  At the picture.  I don't know, though.  Are you laughing?  Let him laugh.  I just saw the picture.  I was like, oh my God.  It's the one where E-Rock's head is superimposed on the fat guy's body, I think.  And he's holding his titties.  You don't think that's a nice picture?  No.  That's just so mean.  You guys are so mean, he says.  You don't like that picture, Roland? 
[00:42:30]  No, it's just mean.  No, it's just mean.  But it's not his body.  It's just his head on that body.  No, it's mean to the guy whose body it is.  But that dumb head is put on there.  Sorry.  Look at the two fat lumps.  It's great.  Hey, you got Blu-rays, I see.  What do you got?  A Psycho Punch, if you guys want one.  What is that?  It's like 300, but with chicks.  Was it good?  I haven't seen it yet.  Of course not.  That means you saw it and you didn't like it.  I haven't seen it yet, actually.  You've seen every movie.  Oh, I have that already.  Yeah, thanks. 
[00:43:00]  Sorry.  You don't want to see that, Ant?  Probably not.  Nah, I don't think I do.  I don't think I do.  Hey, what's going on with Palin  in this Bachman?  What about it?  Palin is not happy that she's out of the spotlight  for the Bachman.  Well, yeah, it's one of those things.  You know, chicks get a little catty.  So Palin's got to make believe that she might still run  for the presidency.  It's all bullshit.  This whole thing is bullshit.  This is a big publicity thing, you know,  because she's got that movie  and her daughter's got a book 
[00:43:30]  and all that horse shit.  But Bachman is running for the presidency, right?  Yeah.  Doing a bus tour, doing the whole Palin thing,  and now Palin has to make believe,  well, I still might run.  Yeah.  I still might run.  Because she doesn't want to be out of the spotlight.  She's doing it just to stay in the spotlight.  But gosh darn it.  And then Bachman says that the media wants to see  those two oil wrestle or something, mud wrestle?  Who said that?  I don't want to see that shit.  That's outrageous.  Someone's got to apologize.  Well, Bachman said...  I said I won't see a mud wrestle.  Bachman said they're trying to get the two at each other 
[00:44:00]  to the point where maybe they would mud wrestle or something.  You're not that hot, Bachman.  Relax.  Oh, damn.  Calm the fuck down.  I don't see that happening.  Why is everybody throwing Chris Hansen  under the fucking bus  because he was cheating on his wife, apparently?  Who cares?  He's not a pedophile.  Oh, my God.  Let's talk about that next.  He's not a pedo.  Yeah, but when you get a guy that,  regardless of what he was filming secretly,  when you get a guy that does the secret filming  and then he's caught with the secret filming, 
[00:44:30]  people tend to jump on board and go out.  Turned on him,  and the guy was going after guys  who were trying to fuck kids.  Well, you don't know the full Chris Hansen story  because he went past that show  and really started getting into some bullshit.  Oh, did he?  Yes.  I told Anthony there was one I saw where,  you know, there's a thing that happens in New York  where bikes are being stolen.  They go to bike shops  and they're selling these nice bikes to bike shops, you know?  Yes.  So Chris Hansen sets up a sting operation  with this bike store owner. 
[00:45:00]  I saw this recently.  And the guy on camera,  I mean, hidden camera,  said,  No, thanks.  I'm not interested in taking your bike.  And the Chris Hansen people kept pushing and pushing.  And the guy's like,  No, I don't do this.  No, you'll have to go somewhere else, you know?  And the guy keeps begging,  Come on, man.  I need the money, you know?  Come on, come on.  Over and over again.  And finally the guy goes,  All right, I'll take your fucking bike.  Here's a hundred bucks or whatever it was.  And then Chris Hansen pounces on the guy. 
[00:45:30]  I'm Chris Hansen.  And now saying how this guy's a bad dude.  And it was complete entrapment.  And the guy said no a million times.  But I guess the film crew didn't want to go to another bike shop.  They were already on location.  So they just kept pushing and pushing and pushing.  And that was the day I said,  Fuck this Chris Hansen.  He's an asshole.  I kind of like Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  I like the fact that he's getting pedagogy.  Well, I don't mind the To Catch a Predator shit.  Yeah, we've all liked that.  But you've got to see the one where,  and then the bike owner loses his shit 
[00:46:00]  and wants to punch Chris Hansen,  wants to punch the camera guy.  Why?  And, huh?  Why do you want to punch me?  But the guy was doing the right thing over and over again.  Yeah.  He finally agreed because they wouldn't leave.  And they kept going at him and going at him.  If you could find this clip,  this is why I think some people might not like Chris Hansen.  He bought a stolen bike.  No, I didn't buy a bike.  Now, see, this is when he finally gives in  and buys the stolen bike.  You bought a stolen bike.  I think you've got to see the whole episode. 
[00:46:30]  I would love to sit down at that fucking dinner table  that he was having dinner with that other reporter  that wasn't his wife  and be like,  so, what are we eating here tonight?  Just all relaxed.  Mind if I take a seat?  Well, this looks cozy.  Be like, uh, what?  Well, this isn't your wife, is it, Chris?  She's kind of not even that good looking.  Some reporter from Florida, I guess?  News reporter or something?  Yeah.  I just don't like the fact that everybody turned on this guy 
[00:47:00]  after that fucking dirtbag guy in Dallas  killed himself as he should have.  Oh, yeah, good, good.  Oh, yeah, sure.  I'm all in with all that stuff.  Yeah.  Obviously.  But this is a hardworking bike store owner  that had no intention of buying this fucking bike.  And Chris Hansen just ruined his, you know,  ruined his business.  Did the, um...  You gotta see the whole episode,  because the guy said no.  I can't tell you how many times.  No, I'm not.  No, no.  But they had the whole film crew  and the van with the surveillance equipment. 
[00:47:30]  So Chris Hansen got lazy that day.  Instead of going to another place  that certainly probably would have bought the bike immediately,  he kept bothering this guy  until the guy finally said okay.  He was hounding them.  Uh, yeah.  Eh, you know, that's his gig.  He's trying to make something of it.  So what's the deal with Chris Hansen?  Well, he, uh, went to dinner  with this Florida reporter.  Are there any pictures of her with, um,  Darth Vader or a stormtrooper?  Because she's not the prettiest gal. 
[00:48:00]  So uncomfortable.  The one who he was?  That he was with.  That Chris was with?  Yeah.  Where is she?  She's cute, man.  She's not, I think she's pretty.  Yeah, she's all right.  Let me take a look and see.  She's all right.  Oh, no, I think you're wrong.  I think she was very cute.  The mole knocks down the number.  Is that all right there?  The mole knocks down the number.  Oh, the deadly man.  She ain't bad.  Ah, she's all right.  She's 30, he's 51.  She's better than his wife.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  She's all right.  She's all right.  I'll give it to you.  I'm just giving her an all right. 
[00:48:30]  She looks like Meredith Baxter Burney.  She's a pretty lady.  A little bit.  The stupid mole's got to go.  Get that shit removed now.  See that little mole?  A little beauty mark.  Ting!  You don't want it there when you're making out with a girl.  Yes, you do.  A little doody on the lip.  No, you don't want doody.  Would you kiss a mole in?  No.  Of course not.  I don't want the over-the-lip mole.  After making a name for himself, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the married NBC anchor  was secretly filmed on a date with a blonde television reporter who he has been reportedly  dating for the past four months. 
[00:49:00]  Hanson, 51, famous for being the host of blah, blah, blah, has allegedly been having a steamy  affair with Kristen Cadell, a 30-year-old local TV reporter from Florida.  Last weekend, Hanson was caught on tape taking Cadell on a romantic dinner at the exclusive  Ritz-Carlton Hotel.  E-Rock, born and raised in Florida, where is this Ritz-Carlton Hotel?  Not from Florida, but it's in West Palm Beach.  Well, you certainly know a lot about Florida.  He's probably been there.  West Palm.  His high school cotillion was there.  West Palm, his debutante ball. 
[00:49:30]  He had his bat mitzvah.  His bat mitzvah.  I'm not Jewish.  Yes.  It's good you don't deny the other part of your bat mitzvah.  You're not a girl, you dunce.  I didn't hear it.  Exactly.  He had a fat mitzvah.  Fat mitzvah.  I'm sorry.  Hanson, who has two sons, was caught in an undercover sting operation arranged by the  National Enquirer.  So it was arranged by the National Enquirer.  So someone was out to get him?  Of course.  Was it the wife?  Probably just them looking for a story.  Yeah, I think whenever you get... 
[00:50:00]  Or maybe the National Enquirer got like a little tip.  Yeah.  That, you know, this guy that does To Catch a Predator is fooling around and the National  Enquirer is like, wow, this would be a great story for us.  They busted Edwards at the hotel.  They're the ones who actually got him, I think, right?  When he was leaving.  My question, was the wife in on this?  I doubt it.  Wife wouldn't go to the National Enquirer.  She would be a divorce lawyer.  No, yeah, yeah.  So someone wanted Chris Hanson badly.  Wives never go to the Enquirer.  When you have the opportunity to get a guy that does hidden camera sting operations in 
[00:50:30]  a hidden camera sting operation, you're going to do it.  It makes him look like a hypocrite, even though it's totally different.  Right.  You know, a little infidelity there.  Oh, boy, Chris.  Paramed last March at a party in Palm Beach.  Where's Palm Beach there, Iraq?  Iraq, that's where you're from?  Around there?  Is it a nice area?  Very nice area.  Oh.  God, you know a lot about Florida.  It's very strange.  His whole life was spent there.  He loves Florida.  How many years did you spend in West Palm Beach?  30.  Three years. 
[00:51:00]  Three.  Three out of 30.  And the rest of the time when you were living in Florida?  Wasn't living in Florida.  From Long Island.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Yeah.  Cadell, who was once an intern with NBC in New York, introduced herself to Hanson,  and there was an immediate physical attraction between them.  Yeah.  The source added, Chris and Kristen got on so well that she ended up going back to his room.  Yep.  At the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach.  Oh, yeah.  And later boasted to pals about staying the night with him.  I love Chris now. 
[00:51:30]  They had cameras set up, and that also caught them leaving the next morning in different  clothes.  Oh, shit.  Each other's clothes?  No.  That would have been odd.  I'm wearing a dress.  Yeah, in different clothes, so you can assume some shenanigans went on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like the fact that he fucked the intern.  Good for him.  Plugged her in the Ritz.  I like fucking biting the shitter.  I think this.  I like the Chris Hansen until he really started going after the working Joes and really just 
[00:52:00]  pushing it a little too far.  That's because they took his show away, because people were going to sue when they're fucking  pedophile relatives off themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  Gives a shit.  Exactly.  And in the end, who gives a fuck even if this bike owner did fucking buy a stolen bike?  Who gives a fuck?  These guys are trying to make a living.  It was just trying to make a living, too, though.  It's harder and harder to make a goddamn living.  I'm not going to bash him.  It was probably a thing.  It went kind of sideways.  He needed a fucking piece of tape. 
[00:52:30]  Eh.  Guy should have kept going, no, I don't want to.  No, get away.  No.  He did as much as he could.  We're all weak in the end.  As much as you could is pretty much not doing it.  Oh, come on.  I'm with Chris on this one.  No, you're not.  Oh, yeah.  Because the bike owner was black.  Well, no.  Roland, why are you laughing?  But because I think, you know, if I see Chris Hansen on the sidewalk again, I don't want him to punch me. 
[00:53:00]  Well, also, I mean, the guy tried to get all our emails.  He didn't want to be our pen pals.  No?  He wanted to do some digging.  What do you mean?  When he came in, he's like, hey, he was asking for all our emails.  You think he wanted to set us up in a sting operation?  He wanted to fucking do some digging.  You don't remember that?  Dick pics?  Why would he want our email?  Probably because he was afraid you'd ask for his number.  And he didn't want to give his number.  So he's like, let's trade emails.  To correspond. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Be friends.  I'm sending you my cock.  I was always suspicious of that guy.  Manic Depressive from Dallas.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, boys.  Supposedly yesterday, Ronnie B overheard Mark Goodman saying about Roland.  He was so pissed off with him that he just wanted to squeeze his head like a zit.  Wow.  Yeah, he said he wanted to squeeze Roland's head like a zit.  Like a zit?  Who the fuck is Mark Goodman? 
[00:54:00]  Exactly, man.  Come on now.  You don't treat a guy like Mark Goodman like that.  Yeah, they were brought into false pretenses.  And then no effort made whatsoever to actually make him feel like he was being interviewed.  That was effort on Roland's part.  Don't you understand that?  That was Roland being Roland.  I celebrated his 30th year on MTV.  Is that what it was?  I mean, 30 years ago.  30 years ago?  Yeah.  That's what that was about? 
[00:54:30]  That's what I found out later on in the afternoon.  Because it's 2011.  And yes, it was in 1981.  Wow.  That they did that.  Wow.  He's an asshole then, asshole now.  Whoa!  One of the original MTV guys was my Little League coach.  What?  He was...  Which one?  A VJ?  No.  One of the behind the scenes.  He was one of Howard's bosses, too, at NBC.  Oh, a Little League coach, huh?  Any touching going on? 
[00:55:00]  No, he was a nice guy for me, I remember.  His son, Greg, was a friend of mine.  Hey, they're taking over 80s on 8 this weekend, but don't they do 80s on 8?  But they don't take it over.  What does taking it over mean?  What's the difference?  That's where they hang out.  Yeah.  That's like us saying, we're going to take over this channel this weekend.  Yeah.  We should do that.  An Opie and Anthony virus takeover for 4th of July.  But we already do that.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  It's not packaged that way.  Packaged.  Everything has to be in a package. 
[00:55:30]  What does the takeover entail?  Let's package this.  I'll make you spicy, the name.  I don't know what the taking over is.  It's like they just probably lock themselves in the studio and play whatever they want,  and you never know what's going to happen.  It's going to be crazy?  Sure.  I think what it means is instead of talking for 15 seconds in between records,  they're going to get to talk for 20.  Are they going to have memorable moments from the 80s?  Boy, I hope so.  Have some interviews.  I would like to play memorable moments of traffic jams only. 
[00:56:00]  Can I ask an honest question?  Can I ask an honest question?  Why are they important?  Because they are an institution.  Why are they an institution?  Well, because MTV changed the face of music in the country.  Well, sure.  The music did.  And the DJs were the face of the music.  They were the every person that was listening to the music.  Give me one moment that Alan Hunter, Martha Quinn, Mark Goodman, Nina Blackwood, or J.J. Jackson did that's memorable. 
[00:56:30]  Kiss kind of taking their makeup off with J.J. Jackson was a memorable moment.  Was it?  Yes.  What happened?  Kiss taking their makeup off.  That's Kiss taking off their makeup.  But with J.J. Jackson was the interview.  He just happened to be in the room.  Well, he was the obvious one.  Was he the one that told him to take the makeup off?  Well, they thought he was wearing some too because he was black.  Oh, that's true.  But yeah, that was a memorable moment.  You know, I can't remember specifics, but the Christmas parties they would have. 
[00:57:00]  And there would be like rock stars in there and be like, oh, and it was a big party.  Things like that.  Live Aid.  What did they do?  I don't know.  Anyone could have done that job.  But they were the ones that were the intermediary between the music, the musicians, and you.  They were just 80s people hanging out, enjoying the music.  They were able to, you know.  So you respect music jocks?  No. 
[00:57:30]  All right, good.  I don't respect anybody.  I think music jocks are a joke.  Because they were the face, I think, of this amazing new way of enjoying music.  You knew them.  You knew Martha Quinn wasn't going to play Ozzy.  You knew Alan Hunter might or Goodman might.  It was really, I mean, and I didn't know back then they didn't pick the songs.  It's like, it was a weird thing to watch.  The interviews that they would do, they'd sit at that little booth and do a little interview.  What booth?  It was like a little booth.  It almost looked like a diner booth.  And I remember Nina Blackwood was sitting there with fucking, you know, somebody and having an interview. 
[00:58:00]  But you had no memories.  Well, no, no, I do.  I just can't, like, call them up like that with that.  I could do a cigarette jingle from the fucking 60s.  What were these guys doing before?  I know J.J. Jackson was a big-time radio guy.  He was the only one that had any kind of resume before that.  Yeah.  Because my thought is I think no one really wanted that gig because they didn't really understand what it was going to be.  I remember they got lesser, lesser known radio people to do it. 
[00:58:30]  I remember them more than I remember any of the reality show people from MTV.  That's true.  Yeah.  The original launch, August 1st, 1981, very first hour, part five.  All right.  Let's see what they do in the first hour.  First of all, we're halfway through.  What do we call that thing again?  That's part five.  Oh, what was that called, Jimmy?  The little time bar? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, the Tadsk.  Here's the first hour.  Let's see what he does here.  First hour of MTV, 30 years ago.  Wow.  Wow.  There's obviously a glitch.  Yeah.  Not only am I real excited that my very favorite sneakers could be here with me tonight, but we are all very excited here at MTV to be bringing you the best music all day, every day.  But we're also going to cover the music world from coast to coast, and we do mean that. 
[00:59:30]  All 50 states, every day, we're going to have special reports for you from across the nation on almost any subject that relates to music.  And to start us off on this nationwide coverage, we've got Bob McClain with a look at the Ramones and their triumphant return to their original starting place right here in New York City.  Back in 1974.  Wow.  I rest my case.  MTV changed.  Anybody could have done that.  All the camera shots and stuff like that, they really were innovative when you look at what they did with cameras. 
[01:00:00]  It's like they changed the way television was watched.  Yeah, I agree with all that, but I'm talking about the guys.  What did they add to it then?  Anyone could have done that.  They couldn't have just played.  Well, if anyone did, it would have been them we'd be talking about.  They were just the anyones that did, I guess.  Alan Hunter has Loverboy on his show today.  What?  That's right.  You should pop in.  I probably don't.  Are they going to play live? 
[01:00:30]  I doubt it.  I mean, it's on the...  I'm assuming it was taped when I did mine live.  Oh.  Oh, right.  Who's at the bottom there, Sam, at the bottom of that page?  Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  Oh, okay.  That's your Duran Duran.  Good old Duran Duran.  All right.  Well, good for them.  30 years of doing whatever the fuck they do.  30 fucking years, man.  Let me see if I can get them in.  Easiest gig in the business.  Here's Duran Duran.  MTV.  Boom.  Hit the video.  Must have been nerve-wracking, though.  Why was it nerve-wracking? 
[01:01:00]  You got to get up there in front of a camera.  Brand new thing going on.  Everything was written for them.  They weren't off the cuff.  We've been off the cuff for an hour and 10 minutes.  You're a hater.  Oh, my God.  Look at Nina's hair.  Nina Blackwood?  Nina Blackwood's hair.  She has purple and pink.  Duran, Chrissy Hyde, the Pretenders, back on the chain gang.  We've been telling you about our Escape Hatch contest.  Well, we have another one right around the corner for you.  Another interesting one.  Oh, who comes up with these ideas?  This is MTV Hawaiian Luau with Pat Benatar. 
[01:01:30]  Sounds quite interesting.  Does it?  And something very interesting from Styx.  Something with a theme.  Heavy metal poisoning.  Stick around to watch it.  That hair was hilarious.  Yeah, she really was.  Like one of the way outs.  You ain't going to hit me, are you, Ramrod?  And they're showing commercials and everything?  Yeah, they try.  1984 Buying Guide issue.  That's amazing.  I love old shit like this.  I would watch this. 
[01:02:00]  Original broadcast.  1983.  This is a really big moment.  After 10 years together, exclusively here on MTV this evening,  we are going to see Kiss without their makeup for the very first time.  Vinnie Vincent, lead guitarist and co-writer of many of the songs on the current Kiss album.  Eric Carr, drummer, has been with the band since 1979.  And Kiss is, by the way, the very first band that Eric has ever been with.  They're showing the makeup and then they dissolve into who they really are. 
[01:02:30]  That's not the original, guys.  Paul Stanley, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist.  Paul is a co-founder of the group.  Wow.  Gene Simmons, bass, also co-founder of Kiss.  Douchebag.  He is the fire-breathing, blood-spitting monster of Kiss.  Welcome, guys.  This is amazing.  It's so funny because just seeing you for the very first time,  after all this time, we're honored and we're really glad to have this exclusive. 
[01:03:00]  For all of you guys, actually, this question, it would be interesting to get your response  because I'm sure everyone in America wants to know,  and especially anybody who's been a Kiss fan,  and there are many of those over all these years,  very first time out.  How does it feel now, without makeup, appearing for the very first time?  It feels good.  It feels...  We've always been close to our fans.  In fact, in a lot of the shows,  we'd walk out into the crowd to sort of get a feel of what everybody was feeling like,  and most often they really wouldn't know it was us, 
[01:03:30]  so we've always felt closer,  and I think it's time for them to sort of know us a little bit more.  It feels very, very comfortable.  I mean, I hope it seems that way.  I feel fine about it.  You know, I'm fine.  Actually, it feels great.  I mean, to me, it doesn't feel all that different  because I've seen these guys more often without makeup than I have with makeup, so...  Maybe before a concert, you're playing a major arena.  Did you often, prior to putting you on makeup,  just go out into the audience and...  I bought a ticket at the front door of Madison Square Garden  when we came in to play four nights, 
[01:04:00]  walked through the front gate, through the crowd, backstage,  went to the dressing room, put on makeup, and came up on stage.  But I knew.  Then I got a refund.  Because I'm in the band and didn't want to waste money.  No, but that's interesting.  You must get a really good feel for what the audience is like.  It's fucking amazing that they pulled that off for 10 years.  It's the best.  No, because now they know what you look like,  and we're glad.  It's going to be so good.  They really did.  I remember growing up...  They pulled that off for 10 fucking years without really getting any pictures of them.  Dude, no! 
[01:04:30]  There would be photos of them, like, of Ace wearing, like, a bandana,  and it turns out it probably was them, but it was amazing how they pulled that off.  Didn't Circus Magazine have a picture of, a shot of one of the guys in a mirror or something?  I remember growing up.  In a mirror?  They might have.  In the late 70s.  But nobody knew if it was them.  That was the thing.  Oh, okay.  A photo would be released where you'd catch...  They always had bandanas with them, and you'd always see, like, you know,  this is Ace Frehley, and it was just from the...  It was fucking enraging because it was from the eyes down.  Like it was robbing an old-time train. 
[01:05:00]  But for 10 years, they pulled it off.  It wasn't like a six-month gag.  For a decade, nobody knew what the fuck kissed.  I forget that.  Yeah, that's a big deal, obviously.  That was a huge moment.  I remember that.  Of course.  I want to say the...  Oh, Kiss Unmasked was the record.  Okay.  Yes, Unmasked.  I always...  I liked J.J.  I did.  Yeah.  Because he seemed like he was a...  Well, J.J. was a professional broadcaster.  Right.  I think the rest of them just kind of lucked out.  Yeah, the other ones were just kind of, you know, hey, well... 
[01:05:30]  And now they're still living.  Living in the 80s.  Ah, what a place to live, though, right?  Do they look like they're still living in the 80s?  Sort of.  They all look similar to what they look like now.  I just saw angry faces.  Yes, it's the same people.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Roland.  Ah, Roland's great.  Goodman was a DJ in Philly.  All right.  Yeah.  He came from the radio world as well.  Yeah.  Well, you know, 30 years.  30 fucking years. 
[01:06:00]  James to bang Diana Ross.  Really?  He was banging Diana Ross at one point, yeah.  Cher.  He was fucking all of them.  Yes.  Not anymore.  And I just hawk my wares and say things that are stupid and dishonest.  Shut up.  He wants to hear from you.  You and your dumb wife.  Whatever the fuck she is.  Whatever the fuck you're trying to hawk her off as on your dumb show.  You don't like Shannon Tweed.  Oh, they're back together now.  I hate that whole family.  They're back together now.  Oh, are they?  Wow.  What a surprise. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  We decided it was better if we're together to best keep the money rolling in from the show.  How much do you need, Jane?  I used to hang with my Uncle Mike with Bad Mouth Kiss from my Aunt Carrie and I would cry.  Ah, Jane.  Yes, I wouldn't like it at all.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  I won't cry now.  I'm over it.  I liked the kiss growing up.  I'm so tall.  All right.  Thank you, Roland.  Yes. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, wow.  Kiss released Love Gun 34 years ago today.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  34 years.  I looked down.  They came with a little Love Gun in it.  I loved Kiss.  It did?  Yes.  Little tattoos you could put on.  What?  That sounds crazy.  You guys want to hear an impression?  Nope.  Yeah.  This is a good one.  Who's this?  I can't be there until Tuesday.  Bill Tetley?  No.  Oh.  Limpy?  No. 
[01:07:30]  It's Egg Boy.  Oh, Christ.  Why do we even bother trying?  He was running late.  He was supposed to be there Monday, but it's plainly sweet.  I can't be there until Tuesday.  Well, fucking turkey and American cheese boy wants to fucking clog his mouth with food.  Turkey foot.  No, not turkey foot.  Ew.  Let's play something. 
[01:08:00]  Mildly toasted.  Yuck.  We got stuff to do after the break.  Yay.  Oh, we got the band Rain coming in today.  What?  Yeah.  They do like the Beatles.  They're on Broadway.  Impeccably to a T.  Yeah.  Better than the other guys.  What?  Beatlemania?  No.  A few years ago?  I forgot their names.  Fabfo.  Fabfo?  I'm a big fan of Fabfo.  Are these guys better than Fabfo?  Didn't they?  They said they stayed to the era.  Why didn't they just call it Beatlemania and do like a revival?  Probably Yoko owns the rights. 
[01:08:30]  Yoko owns the rights to what?  The Beatlemania stuff.  She does?  I guess so.  Because she owns certain things.  You're just talking out your ass right now.  Pretty much, yeah.  And blowing fucking gas out of it.  Interesting thing about Lennon today.  He was a closet Republican, his assistant is saying.  Is that true, you think?  Yeah.  He probably liked to.  Keep his money?  Yeah.  He was probably embarrassed.  They said he was a little embarrassed by his former self.  But he grew up.  And when you hear that last interview, remember they played the audio?  Yeah.  Where you could hear him, he's like, you know, I thought everyone was the problem but me, 
[01:09:00]  but I was the...  He really did change.  Lennon was not the guy.  I think he realized, yeah, like, all right, I had some youthful fucking delusions of grandeur  and shit and realized, look, I'm just a guy making music.  I don't have all the fucking answers.  He liked Reagan?  Yes.  Who didn't?  I want to hold your foot.  That's what he sang later in life.  Prostate.  He lost his mind.  I want to hold your breast. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  Number nine.  Number four.  Yes.  It's from the White Album.  My personal favorite.  I'll get it.  I don't like black people.  Why?  I used to think Rubber Soul was called Rubber Soul.  I didn't know what...  I, for some reason...  Do you remember going to the library and renting fucking records?  You could rent records for free.  How old are you?  42.  I'm 57 years young.  Yes, young.  You could get records, man. 
[01:10:00]  That's how I got the Woody Al...  I remember the smell of the hard plastic coating they would put over the actual album cover,  like over the record so it wouldn't get damaged by all the people taking it out.  I used to go to the fucking library and get records, and I got Rubber Soul.  Rubber Soul.  And what, you have to bring it back, obviously, huh?  No, you throw it in the street and then someone picks it up.  Of course you brought it back, stupid.  No, you sent it on its way and it walked back.  You rolled it.  Rolled it.  Yeah, you made a fucking...  You have four albums and you put them on your car and you drove it back. 
[01:10:30]  The thing happened.  No, you didn't.  You got a fucking carrier pigeon to drop it off onto someone else's record player.  What a dummy.  Yeah.  I know.  That was a good question.  Right when I said it, I'm like, of course, a library.  You hoard all the records and you open your own library and you pass it on.  And so on and such forth.  All right, let's break with something here.  So we got the band Rain doing a couple songs.  How many songs are they doing today, Roland?  I think three.  What song are they going to do?  I think you get a pick one or something. 
[01:11:00]  They're doing two.  I don't like old Beatles.  No?  I like the trippier shit.  What are they going to do?  No, I think if you're going to see it live, I want to see some old Beatles.  No, I want trippy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am the walrus shit.  Well, I would like that, but I don't want any obscure shit.  I don't want to hold my hand or whatever.  No.  No.  I just want like...  Sergeant Pepper.  No, no.  No, not Sergeant Pepper.  I don't love that one.  I want trippy shit.  I want in my life.  That's the best Beatles song I think.  That's an old one, though.  That's an old one.  But it's a fucking good one. 
[01:11:30]  Then again, Let It Be is a great tune.  That's a newer...  Yeah, yeah.  None of those two-minute songs.  Fuck that shit.  How great was McCartney doing Let It Be at the Apollo?  That was amazing.  And I don't want to hear Back in the USSR.  I don't either.  Yeah, we don't want Back in the USSR.  Tell him no fucking Back in the USSR.  Tell him that's a fucking deal breaker.  And no...  No Back in the USSR.  No Sergeant Peppers, which is a good song, but it was to be always overrated compared to  some of the other stuff.  No paperback writer, because Voss comes out to that. 
[01:12:00]  And Bonnie had the best line ever.  She goes, how ironic, because he's never read one.  She murders him.  Why does he come out to that?  Because he's an idiot.  He thinks it's...  He's a dope.  That's why.  That's the answer.  In a nutshell, he's dumb.  He's a dope.  I want to hear fucking...  Get the playlist rolling.  Yeah, yeah.  And if they have those stupid haircuts, fuck no.  Oh, no.  I think they probably will.  And put hats on.  Day in the life.  I don't want to see the stupid haircuts.  Day in the life.  Day in the life is very good.  Day in the life.  Good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good.  In 25 minutes or something. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah?  Well, you better get their playlist, and then we'll decide if we're going to fucking do anything.  We'll make our decision based on the fucking playlist.  Get the fucking playlist, and then we'll make a fucking decision.  Sam, start writing.  We have demands again.  That's right.  If they're going to play any of those two-minute songs, we're out.  We're out.  We're out.  And so are they.  If they got their silly fucking hairdos without hats on, we're out.  Get the baseball caps today, boys.  What else?  But the Beatles didn't wear baseball caps. 
[01:13:00]  It's not a visual.  We're on the radio.  I don't want to be looking at their moppy fucking-  I want the four lovable Liverpoolians with the mop tops.  Yeah, we want a Beatles experience.  Yes.  We never had that.  You want the bearded ones?  Yeah.  The bearded Beatles?  Fuck yeah.  With like-  That's when I was all in.  Yeah.  That's when I was all in.  The drug taking?  Yes.  Beards are required.  No silly hairdos.  I like how Sam takes notes.  He's very good at this.  What else?  No two-minute songs. 
[01:13:30]  No two-minute songs.  Exactly.  That's useless.  It has to be Lennon before 1980.  Anyone can play that part.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Give me one.  In between songs, no fake Liverpool accents when they're chit-chatting.  Yeah, no chit-chatting.  No, they're not.  They're from Ohio or something.  Right, right.  Stop with the fake accents.  We don't want to-  Hey, thank God you're here.  I want to-  Lovely, lovely to see you.  Tell Mars I want a big plug. 
[01:14:00]  If any of this shit happens, I'm pulling the plug.  It's Jay Moore doing it.  It's a replay.  Oh.  Jay's?  Jay's Moore's?  Jay Moore's?  I saw him on the Iron Man.  What else?  No fake accents.  We got the two-minute songs.  No silly hairdos unless they're covered up with some kind of baseball caps.  Beards are required.  No fake accents in between songs.  What else?  Yeah.  No Ringo songs.  Oh, fuck.  You're so right.  No fucking Ringo songs.  If I hear a yellow submarine, I'd pull that big plug.  Or George Harrison. 
[01:14:30]  No, George-  Ah, George had a-  My Guitar Gently Weeps.  That is a good one.  I'm a John Lennon, George Harrison fan myself.  One of the McCartney?  Yeah, they were-  My Guitar Gently Weeps is a good one.  Paul McCartney knows how to write a pop song.  Oh, he's great.  But I always liked the trippier shit.  Letter B, like on Sesame Street.  Letter B is good.  After letter A comes letter B.  Letter B.  Sesame Street was a-  Really?  Oddly genius, yeah.  How they fucking tied in pop culture to- 
[01:15:00]  I never really cared for it.  Because you were 30 when it started.  I hate Sesame Street.  I was never a fan of Sesame Street.  Fuck that.  I think it's a wonderful programming.  Fuck that.  Sure.  No broads.  Because they wrecked the original Beatles.  No Yoko?  No Yoko's.  If I see just a slight-  In the eyes, pulling the big fucking plug.  No broads.  No Yoko's.  It's all gotta be serious stuff.  I thought you were gonna go on an egg white joke. 
[01:15:30]  What do you mean?  Never mind.  I like the yolks.  No one in saris.  What?  Saris.  S-A-R-I.  S-A-R-I.  Jimmy knows.  No S-O-R-R-I.  No saris.  Not the game sari, which is a wonderful board game.  None of that Indian shit.  Yeah.  If they got some Indian guru with them, get the fuck out of here.  No guru influence or Hare Krishna shit.  Right.  These are demands.  Uh-oh.  Travis is in.  That must mean trouble.  And if they come in with their ties, get the- 
[01:16:00]  I'm not even going out of the fishbowl.  Now I'm not agreeing with that.  I wouldn't mind the black suits, the ties.  That's the early days.  The modern early days shit.  No, because there's some good songs from back then.  Sure.  You just gotta, you know.  Can we come to an agreement?  I want trippy.  You want kind of early.  We gotta get in between there somewhere.  Well, they're doing a few songs, so they're gonna have to do both.  Travis, what do you know so far?  Uh, well, I do know that they asked if we will be filming so, uh, the band could either 
[01:16:30]  come in character or not come in character.  Yes!  I told them we usually do film everything.  Yes!  So I would assume that they would be coming-  Dress up!  Dressed up.  No hairdos.  Yeah, no hairdos is on the list.  No silly hairdos.  No, that means that mop shit.  Yeah, they need baseball caps.  No!  But the Beatles never wore baseball caps.  Thank you.  And some kind of facial hair.  I think there will be facial hair.  Really?  Beards are required.  Okay.  See, it's right on our list, Travis.  The bearded Beatles were the cool Beatles.  Yes, with the coolest songs. 
[01:17:00]  All right, I agree, but-  Are they gonna do the song Rain?  Well, I know-  Because I like that song.  I know that there will be-  Rain!  What the fuck?  You know Rain.  Let me hear it.  That's the-  The whole show is named after this.  This is trippy Beatles.  This is what I want to hear.  Don't hear-  No!  No!  No!  This is a waste of a song.  Rain!  Waste of a song.  It's a good song, but no.  I don't like this!  No.  We got a problem. 
[01:17:30]  It's not familiar enough.  I want trippy and you want pop.  I want pop.  I want pop Beatles.  I want to be able to know this song!  You know this song!  No, I don't!  I want something off the greatest hits records.  And there's plenty to choose from.  Day in the Life is newer Beatles.  Life!  What about Norwegian Woods?  At least I know it.  You know this song.  No, I don't.  I know what instruments they'll be playing.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, drums, guitars.  No sitars!  No sitars.  Write that down.  No sitars.  Yeah, no Sianos either. 
[01:18:00]  Are sitars covered under any of that Indian shit?  Yeah, no Indian shit.  Oh, you did, but or any of that Indian shit.  No Indian shit.  Okay, that fits.  Any of that Indian shit.  Troy has Beatles trivia?  He wants to explain why Rain is so important.  He's been telling me in my head.  Well, just tell him to come in here.  He's not a Beatles expert.  And Travis knows what instruments they're playing.  Three acoustic guitars.  No bass, no drums.  What?  What?  Oh, boy.  Now we got problems.  Wait, how's there no bass, no drums? 
[01:18:30]  That means there's going to be no poppy shit, Ant.  How's there no drums?  That means there's going to be like a Here Comes the Sun.  Oh, no.  Penny Lane or a...  Penny Lane.  Hold on.  What did you say?  No, we didn't hear you.  Penny Lane?  What did he say?  Penny Lane.  What?  Penny Lane.  Penny Lane.  Beatles never did an unplugged.  Exactly.  What do you mean no bass?  That's the first one.  I want to hear fucking a day in the life.  And you got to have bass for that.  You got to have bass, keyboards, fucking like it's got to be a big sound like an orchestra. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, man.  Wall of sound.  Who's fucking us here?  Yeah.  If they don't have wall of sound, we're out.  We want to hear, hey, Jude, bring in 500 people.  If they're not piling up...  If they're not stacking speakers right now, we're out.  That's right.  Fuck this shit.  Exactly.  We're out.  Speakers are not stacked.  I can tell you that.  Acoustic.  Why are we going to the fishbowl if they're doing acoustic?  We could do that in here.  Exactly.  Because it all has to sound...  Fishbowl-y.  Yeah, fishbowl-y.  What's your trivia on the Rain?  No, well, Rain was the first song that they actually used backwards samples in, that they 
[01:19:30]  used later on in the White Album.  And how does that...  No, I'll give you a shot here.  How is that important to naming the band Rain or the show Rain?  Because it really isn't that good of a song.  It's not one of their best.  It's not a terrible song.  But I mean, they didn't have bad songs.  No, the Beatles did not have a bad song.  No, we got problems.  Because now I'm hearing...  Listen to this.  Kevin in White Plains.  Kevin, go ahead. 
[01:20:00]  We got problems.  Yeah.  The guy that plays Paul McCartney is a righty.  And Paul McCartney was a lefty, so it looks stupid.  If there's not a fucking lefty among them, we're out.  No lefty Paul McCartney?  We're out.  I'm a lefty.  We're out.  You're not in the band.  No, I just looked up pictures.  The guy is a right-handed.  Politically, you are.  Oh, shit.  So we're going to have a problem.  It's hard to find a lefty who looks like and sounds like McCartney, though.  Get a mirror.  Get a mirror.  Get a mirror.  Show them through a mirror.  That's what I would do. 
[01:20:30]  They did it in Beatlemania.  So what?  That's Beatlemania.  A righty?  That was the Beatle thing back on Broadway back in the fucking 80s.  We're talking Rain.  A lefty or righty?  It was a lefty.  That's hard to find.  Are we done with our list?  It was good, though.  Sam, read out the list.  Any of these things happen, we're out, and we pull the big plug.  Here are the demands for Rain.  No two-minute songs.  No silly hairdos.  Beards are required.  No fake accents in between songs.  No Ringo songs, specifically Yellow Submarine. 
[01:21:00]  No broads.  No yokos.  You know what we mean.  No saris or any of that Indian shit.  Perfect.  Wall of sound is required.  At least one lefty is required.  All right.  You forgot to comment after, specifically.  Do you want to add to this list, or are we good?  That could be a good...  That's a good list.  If the guy comes in with the wacky John Lennon glasses, no.  Yeah, we want proof.  I'm not buying the fucking...  You don't want the round glasses?  No, that's hack.  Put it this way. 
[01:21:30]  No wacky John Lennon glasses on any of them.  I'm willing to let him slide if they actually have glass in them.  He can't just wear the wire frame.  Who did that?  Beatlemania?  On TV, they always do that.  Well, yeah, because he doesn't have glass in there, because he doesn't need glasses,  perhaps.  Yeah, but you could just get glass in your glasses.  You think he did that?  They'd get all scratched up in his case.  No wacky John Lennon glasses, unless the lenses are...  You sure?  Oh, true.  Corrective.  I want to see his prescription. 
[01:22:00]  All right, good, good, good.  Can they give you a list of songs and let you guys pick?  I want to know the list ahead of time.  Well, we can't pick...  How can we find out?  Because there's an acoustic...  We'll find out.  They're doing an acoustic.  Exactly.  Aren't there people here ready?  Everything's acoustic?  They don't have live instruments?  Yeah, how about that shit?  So they're not bringing in a drum set and amplifiers and shit?  And why weren't we told this sooner?  How is the wall sound?  Well, that really narrows it down to a couple songs.  Yes.  And it's not going to be true to form because there was a lot of other instrumentation going on.  We're so here in Here Comes the Sun. 
[01:22:30]  Fuck.  Yeah, but that's a good tune, man.  It is a good tune.  It's all right.  It's all right.  I like Here Comes the Daughter.  Oh.  See, this is a good tune.  Are there people here?  Are they here?  No, not yet.  All right, fucking get the playlist.  And Harrison also had Something on Abbey Road.  That was a great song.  Something in the Way.  Yeah.  It's okay. 
[01:23:00]  Roland just farted by me.  Why'd you do that?  Should I see if they'll let Anthony play with them?  Oh, totally do.  Yeah.  Well, you can bring it over to the studio.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Rocky Raccoon was unplugged.  On Anthology.  We don't want to hear that.  But there was a lot of songs that they did on Anthology that were unplugged.  Son, toodly doo doo.  Here comes the sun. 
[01:23:30]  I say it's all right.  I got an idea.  Yeah?  They're playing three songs.  Great idea coming in.  Yeah?  All three of us get to pick one song each.  Okay.  I'll take Crazy Train.  No!  But if they're doing it only acoustic, that really narrows it down.  Like a good karaoke machine.  Give us the songs we could pick from.  And it's like, why would they do that?  They should have their instruments. 
[01:24:00]  Where are we at with One-Legged Wives?  Anyone comes in with a stump, we pull the big plug.  Oh, that's funny.  No stump wives.  No stump wives.  Exactly.  Just say no hippity hops.  They'll know.  No stump wives.  Are we almost done with this?  I think...  Where are we at with Billy Preston?  Do we insist Billy Preston is part of this?  They probably don't have a Billy Preston.  No.  If they're bringing in acoustic shit.  They don't have it.  What about the real drummer that played for Ringo?  Oh, boy.  Was there?  Pete Best. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, well...  No, it wasn't Pete.  No, a couple of times.  They recorded it over Ringo's tracks because Ringo sucked.  Didn't Paul do that?  Yeah, probably.  I think Paul did a few things.  I'll fix this one up.  All right, let's do the list one more time, Sam.  Make sure we got this right.  And this is it.  Make sure we've done everything.  Make sure you don't want to add anything else to this.  These are our demands.  All right, the rain demands are no two-minute songs,  no silly hairdos,  beards are required,  no fake accents in between songs, 
[01:25:00]  no Ringo songs,  specifically Yellow Submarine,  and Octopus's Garden.  That's a good song.  No.  What a great place to go.  The octopus has a garden,  you hang out,  it's shady.  I'd like to be under the sea.  Shut up.  I got another demand that plays off Anthony's.  No Octopus Garden,  no songs that don't make sense.  The songs have to make sense.  Yes.  Some of these songs just didn't make sense. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  Put that next to the octopus garden.  Yeah, yeah.  The songs have to make sense.  It's a good song.  It doesn't make sense.  How many songs don't make sense that are great?  That's fine.  Not for today, though.  That's right.  All right.  Fair enough.  Did you do the...  Okay, good.  All right, let's start with saying...  Wait, go back.  All right.  Start from the beginning?  We have to.  Every time you add one,  you've got to start from the beginning again.  That's how it works.  This is the contract for rain. 
[01:26:00]  Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.  No two-minute songs.  No silly hairdos.  Beards are required.  Yeah, required.  No fake accents in between songs.  No.  No Ringo songs,  specifically Yellow Submarine or Octopus's Garden.  Or this piece of shit that we're listening to.  No broads, no yokos.  You know what we mean.  No saris or any of that Indian shit.  Wall of sound is required.  With acoustic guitars, great. 
[01:26:30]  At least one lefty is required.  Yeah.  No wacky John Lennon glasses,  unless the lenses are truly corrective.  Yeah.  No stumped wives.  Yeah.  No songs that don't make any sense.  I like it.  I kind of like it.  That's a good list right there.  Are we good?  I think we're good on the list.  Jim?  Yeah.  That's a fair list.  Looks like we're not going to be hearing rain on the channel.  That's our rain rider right there.  I might be able to tell you what Beatles era we'll be hearing. 
[01:27:00]  So apparently they have like four Paul McCartneys,  four John Lennons, four George Harrisons.  That's a lot of people coming up.  Two you?  I can figure out who's coming in and then who plays who.  Wait, they got different...  I think so.  No, I think the way this works is they have like, you know,  young Paul again.  Yeah, yeah.  It's because it's Broadway, so they probably do that,  and then they leave, and then they change around in the scenery and stuff,  and then like the hippie guys come out.  So I might be able to narrow it down a little.  More rules.  Oh, shit.  We got to add a rule, then.  Okay.  If they switch out any John Lennons or Paul McCartneys... 
[01:27:30]  No, I think it's just we're out.  It's just one.  We're out.  We're just getting one.  No switch out.  Also, we get used to the one guy's John Lennon,  and then he fucking leaves, and a new one comes in.  That's a deal breaker.  No switch outs.  We want to just get used to one version of each guy.  And what era are we getting?  I don't know.  I have to go...  The list is in my office.  If we get like the fucking one from the Cavern...  Let me go get the list.  ...that used to play in Liverpool with Pete Best.  If we get the...  No Pete Best version!  Yeah, but that's the whole tie thing. 
[01:28:00]  We don't want ties.  That's pre-ties.  I'm telling you.  No, that's leather jacket...  Oh yeah, you're right.  You're right.  But I don't want that either,  because then we'll just be listening to the blues.  And you know I hate the blues.  They used to sit there and just play the blues.  Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum-da!  What was the term they used for those, uh...  Shit.  It was an English term.  And when they wore the leather jackets and stuff, it was a word for tough. 
[01:28:30]  Ahmad?  Oh, me out.  Yeah, well, let's see.  It'll pop up here in a second.  They know.  Skiffle?  No, no, no.  That was the type of music.  Yes, yes.  It was a weird name for like...  Teddy Boys?  Yes!  Teddy Boys.  No Teddy Boy shit.  Why not?  Oh, no.  Very good.  What's wrong with a good Teddy Boy song?  Travis is back.  Yeah, just give me a minute. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, shit.  I cannot wait till this comes through.  Okay.  I want...  I actually want the bearded version.  Yes.  Someone just wrote it.  Great.  You just narrowed it down to the national anthem.  That's about all they can play.  Yeah.  We might be cutting a...  Miserable loser.  That's hilarious.  Look, we got our demands.  This is the way we do our radio show now.  Yeah.  It's important to maintain control of your show. 
[01:29:30]  Absolutely.  You're going to get Yesterday.  That's what you're going to get.  That's fine.  You know what?  That'd be cool.  I'll take Yesterday.  But it might not be the era of the guys that are coming over.  But anyone can sing Yesterday.  Yeah.  It's going to be acoustic guys, and they're going to go...  See, that's what's great about the Fab Faux.  Because they play I Am the Walrus.  They play I Want You, She's So Heavy.  They do everything.  And they do all the great songs.  She's so...  We could have him change the words. 
[01:30:00]  He's shaking his head.  He's so...  Heavy.  Come on.  Let's not bother.  Poor kid just sitting there trying to relax.  He's not happy.  He hasn't been happy all day.  Whatever.  Why isn't he happy?  Well, he wasn't happy about the Twitter account going up.  I woke up, got out of bed.  I'm really late today again.  My alarm didn't go off, and my power shut off.  They played an alarm, and it was ten after six. 
[01:30:30]  I'm hungry.  I woke up, got out of bed.  She put a gun against my head.  Sorry.  Okay, so we're getting...  Then I went downstairs and drank a cup of soup.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I see a skinny tie.  Isn't that on our list?  Yeah.  And a righty Paul.  It seems like we're getting a few from each era. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  They're going to mix it up?  Yeah, so we're getting this guy.  We're getting Joey.  Who are we getting?  Joey Caratolo.  Who's a young McCartney.  That's early.  That's early.  That's fucking...  Joe Bathorn, who's a little bit of an older McCartney.  Uh, but the requirement is met.  A beard.  That's a beard.  But they're also not allowed to switch out for the entirety of the segment.  Wait, wait.  Are two Pauls going to be playing at the same time?  They better be, because they're not allowed to switch.  Hey, oh, hey.  Are two Pauls going to be playing at the same time?  It's possible. 
[01:31:30]  You never know what that is.  That's insanity.  We don't want to have to get used to more than one Paul.  This is like Back to the Future.  Yeah.  There's going to be said that already.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  David Leon.  We get the...  It looks like we're getting the John Lennon from...  Late 70s Lennon.  Yeah.  Like right before...  The later John Lennon.  That's good.  Do they have a guy come out and shoot him?  Because that seems to be the guy where...  Yeah.  And that's it?  Yeah.  Two Pauls, one John?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's a great video from Brazil. 
[01:32:00]  What about Joe Bologna?  No Joe Bologna.  He's full of himself.  I thought it was Tom Tetley for a second.  It was Tom Teeley.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  His head's so healthy and vibrant in that show.  Chris Smallwood.  We're not getting one of each.  We're getting two Pauls and one John?  Two Pauls and a John.  From the list that I have.  Could we trade a Paul for a George?  Yeah.  We don't need Ringo.  How much?  We need a George.  At least we're not getting two Ringoes and a George.  Oh, my gosh.  You've got to fucking look at it that way.  Imagine three Ringoes. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  They're just sitting there, and they can't bring drums, so they've got to bring a drum pad.  We're getting two...  And we just hear...  Two Ringoes and a Brian.  Brian Epstein.  That's not a good...  Yeah, that's him.  I'm not a good singer, but I'll try.  Jordan.  I am the walrus.  I am the egg man.  Foo-foo-foo-food.  Ah, you're right.  It's the walrus.  It should be I am the walrus.  I am the sex man.  Oh, yeah, yes.  The sex man.  I am a walrus.  What has he got?  Wow, he's getting a lot of followers, man.  What is?  Whoever this is broke 500 followers for Sex Buzzer on Twitter. 
[01:33:00]  Sex Buzzer.  Who has more followers?  Sex Buzzer or Scorch?  Oh, we've got nuts.  You should follow the Sex Buzzer to find out when E-Rock comes to work every morning.  Yes.  For the people that are just tuning in.  Oh, no rooftop performances.  Very good.  Okay.  But that was Let It Be, right?  But if all of a sudden they say, let's go on the roof for our last song.  We're not.  It was Get Back.  That was for the movie.  That was Get Back.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah, it was kind of cool.  Why don't we demand a rooftop fucking performance? 
[01:33:30]  How about we go up onto the roof?  We demand a rooftop performance.  We want a rooftop performance.  Yeah.  Don't Let Me Down?  That was in that performance.  Don't Let Me Down.  That's a good one.  The wind was blowing.  Remember?  They were fucking playing.  It was kind of cool.  Imagine how nice is that with no lawyers ruining it.  Yeah.  Imagine today.  Technically, if somebody gets hurt, we can't do it.  That's what lawyers ruin.  I guarantee.  Moments like that.  Yeah, just spontaneous things.  Poor guys on the roof.  No one could see them.  True.  No one saw them that day, really.  Yeah, this was cool as fuck, man. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, all right.  We'll hear it acoustic.  It'll be just as good.  No, we don't want acoustic shit.  I know.  The Beatles weren't really acoustic.  No, they didn't.  What do you think?  They went on Ed Sullivan and fucking plinked away on acoustic guitars?  Get back.  Get back.  Yeah.  Get back to where you want to belong.  This is my song about Africa. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wasn't this good shit, man?  Yeah.  But this was like acid shit.  You consider this the acid-y stuff?  This was later on, wasn't it? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  That was their last record.  Yeah.  But the acid-y stuff was like Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour.  White Album, Magical Mystery Tour.  They were definitely on some shit.  I like that Abbey Road.  That's good.  Yeah.  Abbey Road's great.  You have any demands, Troy?  Tad to the list?  I mean, I think the list is good.  I'm already disappointed just knowing that they're not showing up with live instruments.  I'm disappointed we don't get one of each.  Two Pauls and a John.  That's stupid.  Two Pauls and a John is retarded.  That's dumb.  Is one of the Pauls going to play the other guy like a George? 
[01:35:30]  Who knows?  He better because they can't switch out.  That's a requirement.  All right.  So one of the Pauls will be a George.  And even they don't think much of Ringo.  Because there's no drums.  No drums or no drummer.  And how many guys?  Three.  Three.  The Beatles were four.  Two Pauls and a John.  Four.  No.  They have to have four.  I don't care if it's a roadie.  How did we agree to this?  We were bamboozled.  We were hoodwinked.  We're getting ripped off.  If we want the Beatles experience, we have to have four guys, even though Ringo was useless.  I've never heard of a Beatles experience with two Pauls, one John acoustic. 
[01:36:00]  That isn't even close to the Beatles.  That's what makes this so unique.  No.  No.  That's lazy.  That makes it this is all they could get to plug the Broadway show.  I hear it's a great show.  Right.  But I'd like to see a piece of it.  And they have to meet our demands.  You'll see three-fourths of it.  Oh.  And they have to meet all of our demands.  Wow.  This is a hell of a writer.  We're getting a lot of demands.  This is a good writer.  16 demands so far.  All right.  That's good. 
[01:36:30]  That's reasonable.  How about this?  I don't want to hear one of the Pauls singing a fucking John or a George song.  What do these sounds like them?  Who cares?  But if he comes in as Paul, he's got to be Paul.  But the audience won't know.  They'll just hear it.  It's all about them.  Oh, it is not.  This stopped being about the audience years ago.  It's about their auditory enjoyment.  Get back.  Fuck them.  I'm going to laugh at that all day. 
[01:37:00]  You son of a bitch.  Get back to what you once pulled up.  Did you just make that up?  Yes.  It's funny.  I heard it, and it inspired me.  God damn it.  That was a good one.  Let me see that.  Get the song list.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Look at this fucking dumb movie being passed around.  Sam had a disc in his hand.  He goes, can I see that real and sincere?  Can I see that? 
[01:37:30]  And Sam goes to hand it over.  Dude just smacked it out of his hand.  It's fucking that just to be mean.  What's that in that movie?  Sucker Punch.  Sucker Punch.  Sucker Punch.  Exactly.  I'd rather suck a twat.  Or big fat tits.  Come here, space lady.  Shove your space tits in my fucking face.  Let me breathe through your big space nipples.  Sucker Punch my asshole at your tongue.  Fucking rotten blood.  Holy shit.  All right.  This is a very good idea from Gut Shot Drew. 
[01:38:00]  Can Roland stand in the corner and hold a copy of Catcher in the Rye?  Oh.  That's a great idea.  Jesus.  That's good.  You have a Mark Chapman vibe, but slightly creepier.  Yeah, yeah.  That's slightly creepier.  Yeah, that is good.  Yes.  No one has a book in this place, though.  Exactly.  Yeah.  He's going to go down to fucking Hale and Hardy Soups  and try to get it because he thinks it's a bread.  Because no one reads here.  Can I have a Catcher on Rye?  I think it was something. 
[01:38:30]  Should we finally break?  You want the demands for the final list?  We just read them eight times.  How many times are we going to hear them?  There's been more added.  I don't know if you want to.  We added more?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Okay, yeah.  This will be the final.  This is the final version.  Go ahead.  Okay.  This is it.  Finally.  No two-minute songs.  No silly hairdos.  Beards are required.  We might get it.  At least one.  We might get it.  We've got to be kind of reasonable with this stuff.  Right.  As long as one of them has a beard, we're good.  At least one beard. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  At least one beard.  I think we're good for that one beard.  Did you say we have to be kind of reasonable?  Yeah.  Did you actually say that?  Kind of reasonable.  And no silly hairdos.  That means, you know, if one of the guys grew his hair out a little bit, I'm good there, too.  The mop tops.  We don't want the lovable Liverpool mop tops.  If they're all mop tops, fuck that.  All right, continue.  No fake accents in between songs.  No Ringo songs, specifically Yellow Submarine or Octopus's Garden.  No broads, no yokos, you know what we mean.  No saris or any of that Indian shit. 
[01:39:30]  I love that one.  Wall of sound is required.  At least one lefty is required.  No wacky John Lennon glasses unless the lenses are truly corrective.  No stumped wives.  No songs that don't make any sense.  No switch-outs for the entirety of the segment.  No Pete Best version of the Beatles.  We hate the blues.  Not we, Anthony.  I hate the blues.  I kind of like the blues myself.  At least one song must be performed on the roof. 
[01:40:00]  Reasonable.  And band must have four members.  Yes!  That's not unreasonable.  That's not the Beatles if it's three members.  They never did that.  It wasn't a trio.  What are they, Rush?  Stop it!  What are they, Rush?  Yeah, Motorhead.  Let's fucking play the Beatles.  Does Eric have a new What the F ready?  Oh, that's a very good question, Travis.  Oh, that's a great idea.  We did ask for a What the F today, E-Rock.  You got one?  Uh, no.  Yeah, of course not. 
[01:40:30]  Why wouldn't you?  You asked.  Think about it during the break.  Why not, E-Rock?  Because I forgot to look forward.  You're missing Florida?  No.  Oh, that's great.  Remember, sign up.  At Sex Buzzer.  At Sex Buzzer.  That's on Twitter.  So you can keep track of when he arrived.  Yes.  I just Twittered it, so.  Keep track. 
[01:41:00]  I am a follower, a loyal follower.  Yes.  That's great.  I won't follow it, but I'll promote it.  At Sex Buzzer.  And, boy, that pick is great.  Somebody's going to get a lot of followers.  And it says, at Sex Buzzer, Florida, I'm late for work a lot, which I really love.  That's good.  Can we make E-Rock play Ringo?  Yes.  Of course we can.  Can we get a tambourine?  Of course we can get a tambourine.  E-Rock, could you be Ringo today?  Because they're only bringing three, and then it'll meet one of our demands. 
[01:41:30]  How about Rongo?  Now, you said no fake accents for them.  How about only fake accent for Eric?  Steve from Bayshore says, call him Ring Ding.  That's Steve.  Oh, classic.  E-Rock, do you like Steve right now?  Ring Ding.  E-Rock, do you like Steve from Bayshore right now?  I love Steve from Bayshore.  You guys are upsetting him today.  Even though he just slammed you.  Oh, you got you good there.  Steve, poor Eric is not happy.  He's really upset today.  Oh, shit. 
[01:42:00]  That is funny.  Are you not happy right now, Eric?  I'm fine.  All right.  Wow.  What's wrong?  Everything all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go to break.  I got to piss.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  It's all about you.  I got a iced tea shop.  Yeah, that's what you doing.  Fucking Beatles coming in.  Hey, Liam.  Liam.  Ah, ah, ah.  Speaking of people who look British but aren't.  Liam.  Creep.  We have a problem with the rain booking.  Okay.  Yeah.  We have a list of demands.  We have a list of demands.  We're hearing some things.  Okay. 
[01:42:30]  What do you know about rain coming in?  It's a great Broadway show, I hear.  I don't know a whole lot.  My boss booked it with Roland.  Oh, boy.  Hey, wait a minute.  Let me do it.  I love pointing out when this happens.  I just came in to make sure.  I just heard another Sirius XM passed the buck.  Passed the buck.  Another Sirius XM passed the buck, ladies and gentlemen.  It's always, I don't know, there was a guy, he came in, I never saw him before.  I think we're getting the short end of the stick.  We're not getting four members.  We're not getting four Beatles.  And we're getting two Pauls and one John.  Two Pauls and a John. 
[01:43:00]  That don't make sense.  And they're playing acoustically.  The Beatles never played acoustically.  No one.  No one.  It's acoustic guitars.  Did you ever hear the Beatles play acoustically?  With two Pauls.  I just...  With two Pauls?  Thank you.  I know they killed out one of the Pauls.  They did switch Pauls, so maybe they're...  Oh, interesting.  This is an interesting situation to be in.  No two-minute songs.  Wait, you want to read the demands?  Yeah, read the demands for us.  We're dead serious.  At least one beard is required.  I haven't met these guys.  No Ringo songs.  Specifically, Yellow Submarine or Octopus Garden. 
[01:43:30]  No fake accents.  No broads.  No yokos.  No saris.  Or any of that Indian shit.  Yes.  We don't want that sitar.  That's fair.  No sitars.  Wall of sound is required.  At least one lefty is required.  What does that mean?  One lefty.  We're hearing that Paul McCartney's righty.  Oh.  Yeah.  Paul's a left-handed person?  Of course.  Yes, we all know that.  Oops.  Oh, my God.  No wacky John Lennon glasses, unless the lenses are truly corrective.  Okay.  No stumped wives.  We don't need that. 
[01:44:00]  That's terrible.  But it's reasonable.  It's reasonable, though.  No songs that don't make any sense.  That's a lot.  No switch-outs for the entirety of the segment.  No Pete Best version of the Beatles.  We hate the blues.  Yes, I do.  You hate the blues?  Yeah, I hate the blues.  All right.  Couldn't hate a fucking music more.  Jazz?  All right.  Maybe.  At least one song must be performed on the roof.  Nice.  Because that was the coolest thing they did.  Yeah.  It was amazing when they did that.  And band must have four members.  No three members. 
[01:44:30]  Didn't you say that there's three members?  Yeah.  There's talk of adding E-Rock as a percussionist.  That's true.  That would be great, yeah.  But see, that's why we're throwing our demands out now, so they can fix this and get four Beatles  in it.  Well, honestly, I think we should have thrown the demands out like a week ago when I think  it was booked.  I didn't know about it.  But E-Rock could sub for Ringo.  That's true.  We're going to give him a tambourine.  You could do that, right?  He's pissed off.  No.  He does not look happy.  We thought when it was booked that we wouldn't have to make these demands because we assumed  that they were going to come in as the Beatles.  Well, all of these make sense. 
[01:45:00]  They really do.  Thank you.  They really do.  We've toiled over that list.  I don't mean to pass the buck or anything.  I'm sorry about that.  We've wasted at least 40 minutes on this bullshit.  Oh, exactly.  That's all we're trying to do.  We're just trying to get to 9.45-ish.  Let us get to fucking vacation.  35?  What?  Are you doing 15 minutes on here yet?  No.  All right.  Let me go find out what the playlist is.  Could you find out what the playlist is, Liam?  I'll figure it out.  I'll figure it out.  Nice.  And check about roof access.  He's working on it.  Roof access.  Yeah, we need roof access.  Roof access is rough.  I've been up there once.  Get her done.  Tell him to follow. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, Liam.  Follow.  What is it, Rowan?  Sex Bagel?  Sex Bagel.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Not Sex Bagel.  At Sex Buzzer.  If you want to know when E-Rock arrives, all you have to do is follow that Twitter account.  And then time will be posted every day.  I just Twittered a photo of Liam's awful fucking slipper shoes.  Oh, what's he doing?  Those are exactly what my grandfather used to wear.  Hippy moccasins or something.  They're fucking horrible slipper shoes.  They're probably comfortable, though.  I'm sure they are, but they're still terrible.  So is a bathrobe.  You don't come to work in one.  A lot of things, sit on the toilet's comfortable. 
[01:46:00]  You can't come in to work with a toilet strap to you.  Are we ready for a break, Farley?  Yeah, let's take a break.  We're talking for a half hour here.  I got the F.U. line over here first.  That means E-Rock's got to wait another two minutes before he gets pissed.  Oh, E-Rock.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to Bobo.  Hey, Bobo, fuck you.  You don't ever fucking say that shit to your mother like you said it.  It's just fucking disrespectful to this woman who gave birth to you. 
[01:46:30]  So fuck you, Bobo.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big F.U. to Poison Ivy.  That shit sits in the woods and waits for you to brush up against it.  You take a piss and it gets all over your fucking cock.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I got to give another fuck you to Bobo.  I'm sitting here Saturday in the middle of the night and that fucker, I'm fucked up.  Fuck you!  Hey, I like it.  It's been a big F.U. out to, uh, you know, all of you. 
[01:47:00]  Every one of you.  Every motherfucker listen to this.  I hate all of you.  I hate every motherfucker besides myself that lives, walks, and breathes.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to Henry Winkler.  Fuck you, you piece of shit.  You sit there on the show all smarmy.  Oh, I'm such a nice guy.  Look at me.  I'm Henry Winkler.  Fuck you!  No, I'm sorry.  You really are a nice guy.  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to my dad who abandoned me and to the fucking bull dyke who beat me with 
[01:47:30]  her fist until my self-esteem was destroyed.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to send a big F.U. to whoever started saying cunty on the show and, uh, just  started using it in conversation and made the mistake of telling my wife she was being  a bit cunty about something and got smacked across the face.  So whoever started that, fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I just want to make a real big fuck you to my manager, Jen, you fucking alpha female  lesbian.  I'm so fucking good at my job and you just fucking shit on me. 
[01:48:00]  I can't wait to quit this fucking job.  If I can say to your fucking face, fuck you.  Fuck you!  Fuck you to my cranky fucking asshole.  I've been out in the heat working all fucking day.  I'm sweating and I stink like shit.  I can't go fucking anywhere without people fucking looking at me and fucking smelling me.  Fuck you, asshole!  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:48:30]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide, the notorious villain Angerman is hurling  helpless children from the windows of the Lil' Leopard's Orphanage to the streets below.  Who can stop this deranged, diabolical, demented mastermind?  No one...  Nobody can stop me. 
[01:49:00]  I'm invincible.  Come here, little Timmy.  Would you like to see if you can fly?  Come on, stupid door.  I'm kicking you.  Now open.  Oh, wait. 
[01:49:30]  Doorknob.  Stop it right there, Angerman.  Suicide.  Suicide.  That's right.  Stay right where you are.  Don't come any closer.  Or I'll throw another hopeless child to the streets below.  This ends right now, Angerman.  Leave those children alone or I'll... 
[01:50:00]  Or you'll...  What?  What?  Um, what?  What?  Okay, okay, bye.  That's what I thought.  Up, up, and away!  Oh, crap.  I forgot.  I can't fly.  Down my leg!  I'm...  I'm...  I'm... 
[01:50:30]  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm unstoppable.  Stay tuned for another episode of The Spectacular Suicide, where Police Commissioner Vic Dumb calls upon suicide to stop another diabolical villain. 
[01:51:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Prime Time Sam Roberts, and one question with a guest we couldn't get.  Drummer and friend of Conan O'Brien and Bruce Springsteen, Max Weinberg. 
[01:51:30]  Prime Time Sam Roberts here with Max Weinberg.  Max, do you prefer Google or Bing?  The interweb.  That's right.  Ah.  I'll have to get back to you on that, but...  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Prime Time Sam Roberts, and one question with a guest we couldn't get on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Samuel L. Jackson.  Hey, this is Sean William Scott.  Okay.  Hey, this is Seth Rogen.  This is John Heater.  You're listening to Opie and...  I suck at liners, by the way. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, everybody.  This is William Shatner.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We got problems.  I just saw the guys arrive.  Yeah.  From rain.  Cool.  The Broadway show, Rain.  I saw one beetle.  Two beetles.  Okay.  Three beetles.  Yeah.  And that's where it stopped.  Oh, man.  Three guys. 
[01:52:30]  We said we wanted four beetles.  We know the beetles as four guys.  We say we wanted four beetles.  And we have another problem.  Unless they got the fake beards, I didn't see a beard.  No beard?  Maybe they're going to put on a fake beard, so we're going to keep an open mind about the beard thing still.  There's no difference, though, if it's just like this.  The hair was okay.  I didn't see any moppy hair, Ed.  No mop top?  It kind of had longer hair.  But is it 2000s hair?  So we're okay with the hair?  Is it hair of today or hair of yesteryear?  It was sort of in between, I would have to say. 
[01:53:00]  I didn't see any wacky John Lennon glasses, so that's good.  Okay.  I didn't see any of that Indian shit.  No sitars.  So we're good there.  But there's definitely some problems.  Mm-hmm.  Troy's got problems with this whole thing, huh?  Troy is losing his fucking mind outside.  When we went to break, he said this is an abortion, this is bullshit.  What were some of the other quotes?  He said, if you're going to come in and promote a show, do the fucking show.  I don't want to hear a couple assholes playing Beatles songs. 
[01:53:30]  I want to hear Troy.  I'll tell you right now.  I'm in Troy's corner on this one.  But I'll tell you right now.  If you're coming in here with a filter, I don't want to hear it.  Liam, stay outside for a minute, please.  Oh, boy.  Please, for a second, Liam.  If you have a filter right now, then leave.  There's no filter.  I mean...  We want you to speak your fucking mind.  He's always honest.  All right, let's go.  You're getting a pile of bullshit.  In my opinion.  Because if you're doing the Beatles, if you're like, okay, trying to sell the Broadway spectacular 
[01:54:00]  rain, come see the Beatles, and you got a couple jerk-offs showing up, just playing  acoustic guitars, playing Beatles...  Like, I could have brought up some of my friends to play Beatles songs and said, oh, go see  fucking rain.  Me and my brother.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  I've done Beatles songs hanging out for years.  Just have me and my brother Joe.  Yeah, I'd rather hear that.  Why not?  It's like, okay, cool.  You guys are in rain.  All right.  Let's hear you sound like that.  If I want...  You're going to say, you're selling the Beatles experience, and you're going to show up with  that?  You seem very disappointed. 
[01:54:30]  Well, it's like, come on, dude.  You're a big Beatles fan, right?  Especially when you got the fab foe that recreate the Beatles songs perfectly.  He loves that fab foe.  And they did that.  They came in and did just that in the fishbowl.  Yeah, but the acoustic songs are probably going to be really good.  Yeah?  I got buddies that can do a great job, too.  Why are you giving me the finger in there?  Liam's...  What's his problem?  Oh, shit.  We should bring Liam in, because he's got a thing, too.  He's trying to get it all done.  Didn't you say this is an abortion?  Yeah!  And we deserve better? 
[01:55:00]  This is going to be a fucking...  Like, what the hell is going on?  It's like, what are they doing?  What if they play acoustic on Broadway?  Liam, come in.  Tell Liam to come in.  Well, it's just...  You're going to strip down the song?  The Beatles didn't play like that.  No.  They didn't.  Maybe they could do different versions, like, while E-Rock's chair gently weeps.  You were waiting on that one, though.  Oh, yeah.  Liam, sit down for a second.  Sit down.  The problem is, Troy...  Troy, speak about the two Pauls and the John Lennon thing, too. 
[01:55:30]  No, it's not.  It's not.  There's a George, a Paul, and a John.  But if they're selling the Broadway experience, why wouldn't they show up as the Beatles and  play like the Beatles?  Because you can see that on Broadway.  This is something special.  This is something different.  Yeah, but don't you want them to talk about it?  You're getting something exclusive.  Something that you can't get anywhere else except on the Opie and Anthony show.  What the hell's he doing?  Oh, damn.  E-Rock just walked in and got...  He gave you a Red Bull, and he drank half of it, and then he hands it to me. 
[01:56:00]  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck is his problem?  The cow brought to a Red Bull.  Troy, no Ringo.  Yeah.  No Ringo.  He's the worst Beatle.  But he was...  But there was four, and he was one of them.  That's fine.  Okay?  Yeah.  So I want to see fucking Ringo.  Poor E-Rock.  Yeah.  What the fuck is he doing?  So now we're getting a Paul...  A John.  A John and a George.  Yeah.  So just no Ringo.  Okay.  No Ringo, and Troy was screaming in the hallway that the Beatles never did an acoustic song. 
[01:56:30]  No, they used acoustic guitars, but nothing was ever just stripped down to just them playing acoustically.  Okay.  So the guys are open to play Blackbird, Here Comes the Sun...  I told you we're getting Here Comes the Sun.  Norwegian Wood.  Also known as Here Comes the Sub, if it's an E-Rock song.  Oh, no.  Poor kid.  He's just going to have a fun...  I know.  All of which, if you listen to the recordings of the song.  We said we were going to get Here Comes the Sun.  And Norwegian Wood has a sitar.  Yeah, but you said no sitar, so they left it at home. 
[01:57:00]  That's not playing the song as it was recorded.  They have to skip that song if they don't want sitars.  Play another song.  We want Rain playing Beatles songs like they were recorded.  Yeah, it's clearly written.  They don't want sitar songs.  And if there's a sitar in that song, so you don't play the song, play another song.  They could probably do the Ballad of John and Yoko, but it says right here, no Yoko's.  And no weird stuff.  We don't want it.  I mean, there's some limitations to this booking, Troy.  I want...  You gotta work with me here. 
[01:57:30]  What's that?  There wouldn't be limitations if the whole band would be.  Yeah, the band showed up with their fucking instruments and played the songs as they were written and recorded.  Okay?  Troy, you think they're calling it in?  Yeah!  You think they're just going, you know what, this is just an easy little thing.  It's early.  Good way to plug the show.  Fuck these assholes.  We'll just do some fucking half-ass bullshit.  I agree with you, Troy.  I agree with you.  Troy, has the wheel been spun for ten years?  When was the last time you slept?  I slept about four hours and three days. 
[01:58:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I can't tell.  I have diarrhea, too.  Now you sound like Roland.  Why?  I don't know, man.  My shit's fucked up.  Wrong combination of pills, probably.  No, no pills.  I'm just...  So we got just three guys with three acoustic guitars.  I don't remember the Beatles really doing that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's bullshit.  Ed Sullivan would have been treated much better than this.  Didn't they do an acoustic set on Ed Sullivan?  No! 
[01:58:30]  No!  I don't know.  What do you want?  I want the four guys to show up and play the songs as they were written.  You'll get three guys in like it.  The Fab Faux wouldn't phone it in like this.  No?  What if one of them was sick?  They would step up to the plate and be like, okay, this is how it was recorded.  This is how we're going to deliver it to you.  And what song should they play, Troy?  Oh, man.  I mean, where do you start?  Because you're the big Beatles guy.  Where do you start?  I mean, pick the album.  We only get three songs.  No, you can do it.  Well, I would say the real... 
[01:59:00]  Not the hits.  The Beatles gems.  That's what I want to hear.  Yes.  I'm with you.  I'm taking notes.  What do you want?  I want you She's So Heavy.  She's So Heavy?  I want to hear Because.  Acoustic?  I want to hear the fucking harmonies in Because.  I want to hear Off the White Album.  Let's do...  Yeah, when they get to that part where it's like, Because.  No.  I don't want to hear Piggy.  That's a Harrison.  You don't want Harrison tunes, right?  No.  Fuck Harrison.  No, although Harrison was a...  I like Piggies.  I want...  Too weird.  Sexy Sadie.  I want Your Blues. 
[01:59:30]  Wait.  Oh.  Ant doesn't like the blues.  That's a good song, though.  You don't like that song?  Nah, I don't either.  He doesn't like the blues.  I don't care who's doing the blues.  I'm the walrus.  I wouldn't sit and watch fucking anyone to do the blues.  Are those good songs?  I don't think those are hits.  The gems.  The gems.  I like the hits better.  Well, are those songs good acoustic?  No!  No!  I want the hits.  I like Troy.  He's sticking up for this show.  He really is.  You're basically saying this is a lazy booking.  Well, I mean, they could have stepped up to the plate and delivered. 
[02:00:00]  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  They have an opportunity.  Instead, they said, look.  They said, look.  We could just bring our acoustic guitars.  We don't have to load in any shit.  Fuck these assholes.  Amps or drums or anything.  Nothing.  It's a lot of trouble.  A lot of hassle on the morning.  We could just jump in a cab with our acoustic guitar.  Right, exactly.  It's a lot easier for everyone.  Fab Faux loaded all their shit up here.  They brought it all up.  They might as well just do fucking wholehearted, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody else.  Play a different band.  What's that?  The Hanaringo?  Or no. 
[02:00:30]  Who's that?  Fab Faux.  No, the Fab Faux recreate the Beatles songs as they were perfectly.  Perfectly.  It's unbelievable.  Why don't you just listen to the record then?  Yeah, and why would you have a second foot doing this then?  Because it's live.  What makes Reign any different then?  Why wouldn't you just go see the Fab Faux?  Because if you're going through the Beatles experience and you want to sell it on this show.  Then you go see the Fab Faux?  No, come on, dude.  They're coming on the show to sell the Broadway.  Right?  They're coming on to sell the Broadway play.  I would think.  I haven't seen a plug sheet.  So if I saw it, it'd be like, oh, it's some stripped down bullshit. 
[02:01:00]  Why am I going to go see that?  I go down to the local bar.  There's diarrhea, by the way.  Roland, Troy has the diarrhea.  Here comes Roland.  It's like Troy DJing.  Why don't they just use a fucking iPod?  Because they're helping to hire you.  Oh, shit.  You have to go boom.  Troy, you're going to take that shit?  Oh, shit.  Come on, club.  Woo!  DJ shuffle.  He's saying that anyone could DJ.  DJ.  I'd love to see him do it.  I'd love to see him do it.  I didn't understand the point.  Pause, play.  Skip, skip.  Shit.  How is this the same guy?  I know.  It's amazing.  I get confused by Roland. 
[02:01:30]  I wish he did some of this yesterday in the after show.  Pause, play.  That's a DJ, right?  Skip, skip.  Hold on.  Give him a microphone.  He's going to have a microphone.  Troy, are you going to be very disappointed when these guys sound just like Anthony and his brother  could sound?  Yeah.  I mean, they're talented.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd rather you and your brother.  Don't get me wrong.  They're talented.  But if they sound like any other band just doing Beatles songs.  All I'm going to say is if you're showing up here and you're selling the Broadway play,  you sound like the Beatles.  Have the play.  Yeah.  You sell and you go.  And you want the listener to be like, holy fuck.  I got to go see this. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I got to go see this.  As opposed to just like a couple jerk offs playing the fucking acoustic guitars.  Thank you, Martin Luther.  That's Troy.  What?  We got to have the Beatles.  We must have them sing a song.  Hallelujah.  Paul McCartney.  Listen to this fucking asshole.  If Bruce Springsteen was up here.  Listen to me, Cal.  Oh.  They're going to play this song.  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  You've said that joke ten times today.  Think of a different joke.  Only once a year, though.  We're not on the air. 
[02:02:30]  That is true.  I'm kind of with Troy, and I'll tell you why.  Because the Beatles are no longer with us, obviously, right?  So when you hear through the radio these guys doing the Beatles to a T, you're like, holy  shit.  I got to go see this.  Yes.  And then they have the outfits and whatnot.  So Troy, guess what?  It's humid outside, though.  No drums.  Yeah.  There's going to be no drums.  Yeah.  But if the Beatles never performed acoustically, wouldn't it be nice to see them acoustically?  The four actual Beatles perform acoustically? 
[02:03:00]  Yes, of course.  But this is just like that, isn't it?  No, it's not.  It's not.  We have to see the Beatles.  They gave us a body of work, and that is what you have to work from.  And interpret.  No fantasy land.  But this is an interpretation.  It's an acoustic rendition.  But if you're selling the Broadway show as go experience the Beatles, and it's something  other than the Beatles.  Why are you setting up their marketing plan?  Why are you deciding how these guys want to market this show?  Isn't that their decision?  The publicists out there and everything?  Damn!  Well, good. 
[02:03:30]  Then fine.  Play acoustically.  You're not giving it proper justice.  You're not giving it justice.  Just throw paint on the Mona Lisa and say, that's my interpretation of it.  Yeah.  Fuck that, man.  Exactly.  You want to see it the way it was supposed to be?  Exactly.  You're going to experience the Beatles.  Right.  Are we getting the short out of the sticks today, Troy?  Absolutely.  Roland, you don't agree.  We deserve better.  No, it's like when Bruce came here.  We didn't even go, Bruce, you got to play.  Yeah, bring the whole band and everything.  He played acoustic.  It's Bruce Springsteen showing up.  It's actually Bruce.  When Paul McCartney showed up, it was Paul McCartney.  Right. 
[02:04:00]  You know?  It's not like Paul and a couple of people with acoustic guitars.  Show my face for that example.  If somebody showed up to sell Bruce Springsteen, a Bruce Springsteen Broadway play, and it  was somebody completely reworking it and interpreting it completely different, then you'd be like,  what are you doing?  That's not the way it was.  He might have you there.  Not really.  I would go see it, though.  Because they are doing a play about Bruce's songs with his blessing.  Oh, really?  What's it called?  I think Drive All Night. 
[02:04:30]  They're working on it right now.  Okay.  So, monkey cock it to your face.  Liam, do we have a set list yet?  No, I've been in here.  They gave me those four songs and said they were trying to figure out the others that you  guys could pick from.  So I'm going to go get the rest of them.  I don't mind those four songs.  Wait, what four songs?  It was Here Comes the Sun, Norwegian Wood, I'll Be Back, Blackbird.  I'll Be Back.  I'll Be Back.  Yeah.  Isn't that a joke?  I don't know that one.  No?  I'll Be Back.  I'll Be Back?  Yeah, that's what it is.  I don't know.  Maybe I got that one.  No.  Not Get Back.  Is it Get Back?  Oh, maybe it's Get Back.  That's a big difference.  I'll Be Back. 
[02:05:00]  Liam doesn't even know the Beatles as well.  Yeah, that's a line from the Terminator voice.  Get back to where you once belonged.  No.  Troy, what?  He's ringing his crazy ears.  Troy, if you were in charge, what would you say to these guys?  I'd say, where's your shit?  Where's your insurance?  Would you send them home?  Yeah.  Where's your shit?  I'd be like, oh, cool.  Is it cool?  Is there a YouTube video we can watch instead?  And just play the audio from that?  Oh, damn.  I mean, shit. 
[02:05:30]  You're disappointed.  Well, it's like, I was really excited.  I told you yesterday.  Did I tell?  I told OBSI, I'm really excited for rain.  And then we hear this is going to happen.  And then they said, your muscles look good, too.  I'll see you soon.  No week of the week.  I can't say that to you.  I know.  I know.  Exactly.  I know that.  Exactly.  Yeah, you are.  Drink your juice.  Exactly.  I'm drinking my juice.  You should probably drink some juice, too, motherfucker.  Just call Jack Daniels, bitch.  That's why I have big hair in my balls.  You have big hair.  What the fuck does that mean? 
[02:06:00]  He's got big hair on his balls.  Bragging about the hair on your balls.  That a boy.  I hope they can impress us with their acoustic guitar.  I'm going to go make sure.  Maybe that'll change my mind.  I don't know.  I'm team Fab Faux myself.  Yeah.  Really?  I've never seen Rain, though.  So I got an open mind for the Rain.  Fab Faux, they're incredible.  Believe me, I have a complete open mind about this.  But I got to agree that this is not what the play is.  Does Fab Faux do acoustic shit?  I mean, they have acoustic guitars.  And they interpret the songs as they were. 
[02:06:30]  Yes.  So when the songs were an acoustic guitar was used.  They used one.  There's a video out there of Fab Faux doing I Am The Walrus from here.  Yes.  Go watch that.  They did the whole second side to Abbey Road, start to finish.  They had every note perfect.  Yeah.  The harmonies, everything.  They did Abbey Road from start to finish, and I don't think they missed a fucking note.  And if you see them live, they switch guitars, they switch amplifiers, and they use the exact  ones that the Beatles used in those recordings.  It's amazing.  Did they have a drummer?  Yes.  Well, we don't have a drummer today. 
[02:07:00]  We have two Pauls, but one of the Pauls is playing George, and they're going to be just  on acoustic guitar.  So that's just like the Fab Faux.  It is.  You don't care, right, Roland?  No, the Fab Faux, the way it is, like the Leatherman guy.  Fab Faux.  It's fine.  Fab Faux, Fab Faux.  It's all cover bands, so it's all glue.  Oh, damn.  You don't think it's theirs, right?  Nah.  It'll be fun.  It's the last day before vacation.  Yeah.  You're all angry, but we're going to get six days off, so.  Six.  Nice.  I was expecting one thing, and I'm getting something else. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  A bait and switch?  Yeah.  Dare I say.  It's like Lenin once said, life is what happens while you're making other plans.  Oh, well.  And then he signed something he shouldn't have.  Took a nap in front of the Dakota.  You think they're going to sound like jerk-offs?  Oh.  This is what these guys are up against today, so Troy's making some good points. 
[02:08:00]  But that's not a Beatles experience.  They do sound like them a lot.  Exactly.  When you see them live and you close your eyes, it's magical.  You close your eyes, that's like, you know, let's listen to those harmonies.  I only give you my situation.  There's 40 of them, that's great.  And in the middle of investigation, I break down. 
[02:08:30]  Out of college, money's made.  I mean, come on.  That's amazing.  They switch off on vocals.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  It's a great song.  And they look just, they sound just like them.  They don't look like them.  These guys almost look like them today.  That's how easy the Beatles are to do that. 
[02:09:00]  They got Wall of Sound going here.  Yep.  Wall of Sound.  Yeah, but that's all that shit made to lug up.  Listen to that, a harmony.  Fucking amazing.  Where can I see those guys?  They play all the time.  I want to go see those guys.  Radio City Music Hall, usually.  They do albums start to finish, too.  They'll do the White Album from start to finish.  I want to see the White Album, though. 
[02:09:30]  It's a little too freaky.  Freak me out.  The Muppets are coming out.  You know what would be cool here is to lay this over the original Abbey Road and see how it lines up.  See how it lines up.  Are they sell out Radio City?  Amazing.  Oh my God, they sell out wherever they go.  Yeah, they sell out wherever they go.  This makes me want to just throw in some Beatles all the way home. 
[02:10:00]  Abbey Road.  Yeah, Abbey Road, definitely.  Are we going to get the same thing today, right, Troy?  What are we getting again today, Troy?  Unfortunately not, gentlemen.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  I've got to pause that for a minute.  What are we getting today, Troy?  Now, what are we getting?  What are we getting?  We just heard Fab Faux.  Unfortunately, not that.  Not that.  I don't know what we're going to get.  Maybe they'll change my mind when I hear it.  Maybe it's something that I didn't expect to be great, and it is.  But when you said fucking abortion, did you mean something like this? 
[02:10:30]  Or something else?  No, I meant by fucking abortion, taking this brilliant body of work and just fucking making a mockery of it.  He's leaving.  You said jerk-offs with Chicago.  Where's Eric going?  I certainly did.  Where does Iraq go?  He quits.  Iraq leaves at like 8.30, gets his back.  You know what he's bringing.  Of course I do.  Why is he bringing a snack done?  A snack, yes.  And then he just walks down the hall like he's done. 
[02:11:00]  He has toys to give away on his Twitter.  Where's he going, Travis?  Travis, where does he go?  He has to go cut up some stuff for 10 o'clock.  Cut up some stuff?  Steak?  Yeah, because, well, I mean, it's always the same.  Or a rug, he's just going to go dance.  Troy?  Yes.  No, I know a little bit about this Fab Faux.  They loaded in the day before.  It was a big process to get all that shit into the fishbowl.  Well, it's because they took it seriously. 
[02:11:30]  No, money, though, too.  That's what it takes.  And our guys just showed up about 15 minutes ago.  Just rolled out of bed.  With their acoustic guitars.  All right, back to this.  Oh, yeah, let's get a little more of this.  Not the Beatles.  Fab Faux.  Oh, great. 
[02:12:00]  All live voices.  That's amazing.  It took all those musicians to do the album.  Do you think they would let McCartney sing with him?  Or probably no, because his voice has changed.  Get out!  I'm sure they would let him.  I don't know if they would ever. 
[02:12:30]  Imagine that.  No, look, we're okay.  We're cool.  We're going to pass.  How would you tell him no?  It's like, hey, you mind if I sing a song with you?  And they're just like, yeah, we kind of got it, you know?  Yeah.  I think they performed in front of him.  Really?  Yeah.  That's got to be a little nerve-wracking.  And YouTube.  Hey, they don't have a Broadway show, right, Roland?  Yeah.  The hit Broadway show.  They're taking it on the road.  Yeah.  Rain is?  Yeah.  I'm sure it's a great Broadway show.  Yeah, I'm sure when you go see it, it's a cool Broadway show. 
[02:13:00]  I think we're just going to see something very different.  Yeah.  We're going to be under the umbrella of something different.  Yeah, it's like their sound show.  Great.  What are they taking on the road?  The Sgt. Pepper jackets?  See?  Like, with no one in it?  Just the jackets.  Oof.  Hold on.  That was just air quotes with nothing in it.  Air quotes.  I guess Troy's made his point, huh? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, shit.  Troy's made his point.  We'll see.  Yeah, he certainly did.  Well, he said he knows jerk-offs at home who can perform the Beatles on acoustic guitars.  That's what he did say, though.  He said, like, that's his thing.  Jerk-offs at home.  Yeah, I got buddies that could come in with their acoustic guitars and play Beatles songs.  It doesn't mean you're going to go see a Broadway show, does it?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, if you're trying to sell a Broadway show, step up to the plate with fucking guns blazing.  You know? 
[02:14:00]  Troy's hosting the 10 o'clock hour today.  Well, if the wheel falls on him.  With those crazy eyes of his.  Because he hasn't slept lately.  Those are Red Bull eyes.  I haven't had Red Bull yet.  You got crazy eyes.  Yeah, Eric drank half that.  I don't know why he handed it to me.  I said that's a brand new one.  Why would he open it?  Move it from left to right.  Like a madman.  Yeah, why would he move from left to right?  I mean, why would he open it for you?  Why would he open it?  That's weird, because he did something to it.  And you got giant pupils today.  Nah.  What are they all just like?  Yeah.  Just giant black eyes.  He smokes with his jerk-off friends. 
[02:14:30]  Wait, what did I say?  Oh, damn.  He said he smokes with his jerk-off friends.  Jerk-off friends.  Troy, excuse me.  Comment?  I don't even know what the hell that means.  What does that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean, Ron?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Roland's taking this very personal, because it's one of his bookings.  Yeah, Roland worked hard on this.  No, he books for the show, Troy.  It was Liam's boss, head of the way for this one.  Who?  Who's that?  Spectre?  No, no, Liam's boss.  Steve Leitz?  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Wow, you guys are scared to say his name?  No, because he wants to talk to Troy in the minute.  Don't speak his name.  Oh, yeah, I'll talk to him.  That's funny.  No way, I'm just kidding.  I see.  Should we talk to Leitz about this booking now?  He's probably not here.  He's not here yet.  Why would he?  Knowing that the guys are just showing up with acoustic guitars.  Yeah, he probably knows.  He figured, ah, I could sleep in.  What, uh...  Guys should be in their cabs with their acoustic guitars on the way to Series XM.  Let's see.  Let me see.  What about, like, okay, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 
[02:15:30]  I know that's like, you know, Jimmy doesn't like us, but it's very...  I like it.  It's just not as much.  There's a lot of stuff going on there.  A lot of shit going on.  I want to hear Fab Faux doing that live.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Well, we can...  Okay, yeah.  This is, uh, at an actual performance.  Yes.  Live.  This sounds like a bunch of people.  Yeah, I know, right?  Well, spotlights up.  Crowd goes wild.  Yeah.  Here's, uh...  Here's what they do when they come in, whether it's on stage or whether they come in here. 
[02:16:00]  Damn.  I don't think that's the Fab Faux.  That's the Fab Four.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't think that's an interesting thing.  Well, fuck them.  That's different.  I want to see the Fab Faux doing it.  Sam, stop Googling wrong.  Sam.  Sam.  It's F-A-U-T-U-B-ing wrong.  It's F-A-U-X.  She doesn't know how to spell Faux.  That's what it is.  Oh.  I didn't Google anything wrong.  He thinks it's a four-pah, stupid ass. 
[02:16:30]  What?  Hi, I'm the walrus.  You've heard that, right?  Yeah, the I am the walrus is ridiculous.  Yeah, but I want to hear like Sergeant Pepper.  Oingo Bungo does get covered by I am the walrus.  Oingo Bungo.  What happened?  Fixing a hole.  You can check that out.  I want to hear Sergeant Pepper.  Yeah.  I wanted to hear Sergeant Pepper.  Ah, it's a horrid fucking version.  Right up top.  Right there.  Let's see what that is.  It's not live.  I don't care.  Oh.  Yeah, we don't care.  We just need it live.  Who gives a turkey?  This looks live. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Sounds live as people, though.  Oh, my God.  Another shitty recording.  Oh, horrible.  This guy had it in his pocket.  Really?  Forget it.  Rerun had it under his tit fat.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The Dewey Brothers are going to catch him.  We thought you were our friend, Rerun.  All right.  We've got to catch up.  Rerun knifes him.  We're going to break.  We're going to head to the fishbowl soon.  Yeah.  See what these guys are about.  See what this is all about.  We might be pleasantly surprised.  If Troy wants to pitch with them, I'll send it up.  Troy has lowered the bar big time on this one.  Yeah.  He described an abortion. 
[02:17:30]  Our expectations are extremely low right now.  Yeah.  Thanks to Troy.  It might be great.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I don't want to get you in trouble.  I don't want to have...  I mean, Roland, you know, he busts his balls for this place, so I don't want to...  I hope nothing comes down to him.  But...  Don't rape me.  Rape me.  What the fuck does that mean?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It's almost vacation.  I'm tired.  I just love this.  Everybody's all fucked up.  We might be pleasantly surprised. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know either.  Yeah, we don't know.  I'm with Troy on this one.  We don't know anything about these guys.  I'm with Troy on this one.  It doesn't look good, though.  Three guys showing up a half hour ago with acoustic guitars on Troy.  They've been here since six.  Troy said they rolled out of bed and just grabbed their guitars and jumped in a cab.  They still have the sleep in their eyes.  Yeah, they don't need any costumes or anything.  Costumes.  Yeah.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll do something else, and then we'll head to the fishbowl for rain.  Sounds good.  Which sounds like a great Broadway show. 
[02:18:30]  It certainly does.  All right.  All right, man.  Want to get in touch with O&A?  Just call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Smartphone users, send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The O&A Show.  She's so...  Getting very excited.  We're going to be going into the fishbowl in about 15 minutes to see what rain's all about. 
[02:19:00]  Very excited.  Big Broadway show.  Sells out every night, obviously.  It's doing very well.  I don't even think these guys have to be here today.  No.  No.  We were listening to them practice.  Yes.  Sound check.  During the...  This is actually them.  Hello, hello.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hello, gentlemen.  You guys can hear me?  Yes.  Of course we can. 
[02:19:30]  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  All right.  Let's check the other one.  Hello, hello.  Check one, too.  And let's go over here.  The O&A Show, right?  Hello, hello, hello.  I can't hear them yet.  Are those the ones that say...  Yeah, I think he's...  Maybe they'll talk about it.  Show left, right?  Chris, are these...  Do they show up on show left and right?  Yeah, show left and right will be...  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, nice reverb you have there.  Keep talking.  I think we're all in reverb now.  There you go.  One, two.  One, two.  Reverb.  Oh, I don't have reverb. 
[02:20:00]  Huh?  Hey, hey, hey.  No.  I can't.  This mic right here, right?  Yeah.  There he is.  Hey, hey, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.  Nothing on this.  I need more echo.  I got it.  Yep.  I need more reverb.  There seems to be a reverb that was added, too.  More, more reverb.  A lot of reverb.  As much reverb as possible, Chris.  Yes.  Over here.  I want reverb again.  I want re-reverb so much of it. 
[02:20:30]  Hold on one second, guys.  I can't hear you.  Sorry.  All the show audio, including the host mics in there, are going to come up on...  Our names are Opie and Anthony.  The host mics apply I never.  We're listening in.  I'll make sure it's out of there.  Huh.  Don't do that.  I hope one of them drops the N-bomb.  Oh, God.  That would be just our luck.  Of course.  Good one, two. 
[02:21:00]  And the sky.  Ho.  Ho.  All right.  Thank you.  What song is this?  If you want to add just a little, it's good.  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah.  One, ten.  Okay.  Ho.  Ho.  Ho.  Ho.  Thank you.  The little checking mics are really silly.  Well, done.  Yo.  Hey. 
[02:21:30]  What?  Oh.  Play a song.  Wow.  These guys suck.  A playbill.  What's this?  It's a playbill.  Oh, rain. 
[02:22:00]  A tribute to Beatles.  You know what a playbill is?  What's playbill out?  It's been around forever.  Let me see how many songs in this Broadway musical.  You should be able to just pull it up on your iPad, I'd say.  Yeah.  Why would you have to carry this around?  It says paper around.  I hate when you've got to hold this and you're holding it and the ink is in your hand.  I don't hate that.  You're walking down the street as a mark when you get mugged because you're holding a playbill.  Sure.  Sure.  Let's see.  Who's who in the cast?  Okay.  Where's the Beatles songs?  Listen to three people do the Beatles acoustically. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, okay.  So we are seeing the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a girl from me and I don't know the world to see what we met.  I'd have been another day.  I'd have been the other way and I'd never been away.  But tonight's night, night, night, night.  Falling.  Yes, I am falling.  And she keeps calling me back. 
[02:23:00]  I just need a vase.  Why not?  I was singing with him.  Just having fun.  You did well there.  I wish I could just hop on.  You all right?  Did Troy like the sound check?  He's good now?  Oh, look at this.  We got one story to do before we move on.  That guy's kind of Paul looking.  Huh?  That guy doesn't look.  I'm not uncle.  We have this.  Listen closely to this.  I can't really turn around and say how I feel about her because she's not here no more.  This man identifies himself as 36-year-old Marie Joseph's boyfriend. 
[02:23:30]  Tonight, he visited the pool where her body was discovered in Fall River.  The facts surrounding this case are still unfolding, but as of right now, it appears Joseph's body  have been in the Lafayette Park pool here in Fall River for as long as two days,  while the pool was open before being discovered.  People were swimming in there with the body in there.  That's what I feel.  That's impossible.  Ha, ha, ha.  Come on.  How big is this pool?  The body was in there for two days and people were just swimming around and no one notices anything? 
[02:24:00]  Those public pools, man.  Get the fuck out of here.  Let me tell you about those city public pools.  Maybe they'll explain.  I can't tell you anything.  I know nothing about them.  I would never go there.  People were swimming in there with the body in there.  That's what I find.  That's pretty weird.  I mean, there's a dead body in there and there's children and people still swimming inside  the pool and they didn't find the body until last night.  Police found Joseph's belongings by the pool and Joseph's friends tell NBC10 News  she went there with a nine-year-old boy who asked a lifeguard for help when he was there. 
[02:24:30]  But allegedly, he claims he was ignored.  So there are interviews going on right now, exactly who the boy spoke to and what that  person did and what happened next.  From what we've learned here in Fall River, it appears Marie had lived in this housing complex  and folks out here tell us that she will be missed.  What are people saying out here in this neighborhood?  Apparently she was for a couple of days.  That it was negligence from a staff that was working that they actually checked the pool  when they were doing a pool check.  A lot of time.  That's what people are saying in this neighborhood? 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  They couldn't see a dead body in a pool?  A lot of time.  That's weird.  Because those pools are only, what, three feet, four feet deep?  No, they're like deep.  City pools, they're pretty deep.  They got a deep end.  No, they don't.  Like a 12-foot deep end.  No, they don't.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  They're only three feet deep.  No one ever drown in them.  Four feet.  People drown in them all the time.  Four feet deep.  A lot of people that don't know how to swim go in those pools.  Yeah, yeah.  They drown.  Exactly.  I don't know what it is.  But people that seem to not know how to swim go in those city pools. 
[02:25:30]  They figure you could just walk around.  No, it's got like a high dive and everything.  No.  Sure.  Swear.  No.  Yeah, look.  No.  That's the pool.  No.  Look, see?  High dive right there.  You sure?  Yeah.  They're pretty high a lot of those.  Pools are pretty deep.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when I was a kid, I was running along the side of the public pool and there was like  those little, what are they called?  The little things that are open where the filter is?  It's like a little water.  It's like a little skimmer.  It's like a little square that's open after the pool and you could touch the water.  Yeah, you go in there.  It's like it's the skimmer. 
[02:26:00]  You clean it out.  It's full of bugs.  And my foot got, I stepped in it and I tripped and I skinned both my knees on the concrete.  Did you cry?  A lot.  A lot.  I skinned my little knees.  Aw.  And then one time I was running outside the fence of the pool and a woman was standing  with a lit cigarette and I ran right into it with my eye.  With your eye?  Sorry.  Sandy Kaniga.  I don't know.  Why is she yawn?  Sandy Kaniga.  It's on America's Got Talent on Fox News.  I think they found a talking monster. 
[02:26:30]  They did.  Do you love me, Sandy?  No.  Fox News right now.  Hey, that's Nick Cannon, an actor comedian, host of that popular TV show.  I know.  And they featured Sandy Kane's clip.  Wow.  Is he there today?  That's right.  He's here today, too.  Nick and his wife, Mariah Carey.  Have you heard of her?  Just had twins two months ago.  I don't know.  Right.  Maybe a picture for the boys.  What?  What happened?  I want to get a picture with Nicky C.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:00]  Really?  You want a picture with Nick Cannon?  I think we'll be able to get one.  Why?  I'm going to try to get him on the after show.  Is he going to be around?  Yeah.  No, Troy's doing the 10 o'clock hour today.  Well, I don't know.  Whatever the wheel stops on.  A bit money, it's Troy.  Well, I mean, Ant did some gambling yesterday.  It paid off big for him.  Yeah.  I knew it was going to be rolling, unfortunately.  Would you allow Chip to host one of those?  Yeah.  Yes.  That would be good.  I may be interested in doing that when he comes back. 
[02:27:30]  Have him call my people.  Or his people.  Has it been another day?  I might have looked the other way.  I think that's...  What else is going on in the world?  I think we covered it, right?  I don't know why News Corp would...  News Corp sells MySpace.  Yeah, their share of it.  For $35 million to specific media.  Who the fuck would want MySpace?  It's still...  They said financially it's actually doing okay.  They have to retool it a bit, I would say.  It stinks. 
[02:28:00]  It's all spam.  It fucking blows.  It's unbelievable.  It's all spam.  It's like AOL.  Blows.  Why do they allow it?  Busy and noisy and fucking dumb.  Why do they allow all that spam?  They just...  I think it crept in there, and they probably just...  They weren't good at identifying it, I'm guessing.  And then Facebook took off, and nobody gave a fuck for MySpace.  And I'm sure Facebook will ruin it, too.  Apparently...  It's too good, so they'll fuck it up.  I don't like Facebook, even though I use it.  I find it's hard to download pictures from it.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Sam.  Apparently, Justin Timberlake is one of the big investors in MySpace, in the new MySpace. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, is he?  All right.  Oh, well, then I can't fail.  So maybe they've got some kind of plan.  I know everybody wants to know why am I going to the airport later.  Oh.  Why are you going to the airport later?  Oh, Kenny's got casual clothes on today.  That means it's travel day.  He's a fucking sky blue Kenny.  Cash Ken.  We go to Seattle for tomorrow night.  I'll be on B.H.A.'s show tomorrow, I think.  Oh.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell him I said hi.  I will.  And we're doing the antisocial.  Yes.  I think that we're taking network out. 
[02:29:00]  It's like a writer ready with that fucking old reference.  Really?  Yeah.  At somewhere.  Paramount Theater in Seattle, and then Sunday is Vegas.  The Palms.  That's nice.  Yeah, Vegas.  Rollin'.  What's the matter?  Nina Bligh from MTV VJ.  What?  That's what she looks like now.  Nina Blackwood?  Where is she?  Right there.  Is that really her?  Yeah.  Have her come in.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  I'll kill her.  No.  I won't kill her.  Oh, no.  Nina!  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  She's a mess.  That's 30 years ago.  Holy shit, she's a mess.  Yeah.  Her voice is really bad, because I do listen to the 80s channel.  We'll be done.  She said no?  No, no, no.  She's got her.  She's plinking away.  I'm going to be nice.  She's plinking on the keyboards.  She's got to log out.  She's got to log out.  She's got to log?  No, she's logging out of her MySpace or something.  Computing.  Nina Blackwood!  Nina, take a seat. 
[02:30:00]  No.  Say hi.  Hi.  How are you?  We just want to say hi to you.  Good.  Hello.  We have to go to the Fish Bowl because this Beatles cover band Rain.  Actually, it's a Broadway show.  Broadway show, Rain.  Yeah, they're performing for us, but we only have a couple minutes.  We saw you outside there.  We want to say hi.  Well, that's really nice of you, and I have to do a really stupid thing, but I never do  this.  You love us.  I live in Maine.  Oh, I love you, yes.  But I live in Maine, and my mail carrier is named Tiny, and he listens to your show. 
[02:30:30]  Is that ironic?  Because he's big?  Yeah.  And he's wonderful, and I love him, and hopefully he's listening this morning, so  I can give him a big hug that I would if I were there in person.  So Tiny's a fan of ours.  Oh, huge fan.  Nina, I actually listened to you on the 80s channel, and you really do the show from Maine?  Yes.  Right from your house?  Yes.  That's a dream job.  How nice is that?  I thank God.  You know, I lived in L.A. for 20 years, and I was sending all my stuff in, and I'm going 
[02:31:00]  like, wait a minute.  I burn out in L.A.  Yeah.  I've always loved Maine.  And actually, Jim Ryan was the first person, and Kathy Barrusso, that I asked here.  I said, well, what would you think?  I'm thinking of moving to Maine.  What do you think?  And they go, well, bottom line, you know, basically, as long as you get the shows to us, we don't  care.  And, you know, I am so grateful to that all the time, and it's kind of funny. 
[02:31:30]  That sounds great.  Like a great gig.  You're doing a 30-year anniversary, I guess, of the inception of NTV, and the first of  the VJs, of course.  And you were one of them.  Yes.  And so what do you got?  They got you all over the building here?  Yeah.  Yesterday was a free-for-all.  Yeah.  They even had me.  Liam and I were just laughing, because this morning, once you're a VJ, you're always a  VJ.  I come in, I go, where's the VJ prep room?  And he goes, you know, we're not a VJ anymore, but forever we will be stamping. 
[02:32:00]  And he goes, how about hair and makeup?  And, well, we had makeup yesterday, you know, because all these photographers and camera crews  were there.  And it's kind of funny.  Yeah.  Because it's radio, you know.  You're not a VJ to me.  You're a hooker opening the door for Ramrod.  Oh, don't even.  Thanks a lot.  I love that.  Ginger.  Yeah.  White Squad.  That's right.  Ginger.  That is the weirdest thing, that that became a little cult classic with Ramrod.  Ramrod.  Ramrod. 
[02:32:30]  I know.  Yeah.  The white pimp and the big Ford Explorer, whatever it was he had.  But we all knew you shouldn't have opened the door.  That wasn't a song.  I knew you shouldn't have opened the door.  Why?  But the funny thing about that, you know, I was young and in L.A. for the first time,  and they hired me before they hired Ramrod, right?  And so they had me in for the auditions for the guys that were coming in for Ramrod.  They would have me in the room with them and have all the actors throw me around the  room. 
[02:33:00]  That was the audition.  And I know that those producers were, because, you know, it's a girl from Ohio, like, hi,  you know, boom, boom, you know, and I'd go out, you know, I'd sit, you know.  Was that before MTV?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I didn't realize you shot that before.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  And then I became, you know.  Oh, okay.  I thought they got you, like, kind of as a celebrity.  Oh, no.  That was when I was a neophyte in Hollywood, and I know those guys were like, let's see  what we could do with this one, you know. 
[02:33:30]  She's right for more.  That's great.  Open the door, Ginger.  Open the door.  Oh, so great.  Did you think 30 years later, when you first got the job for MTV, 30 years later, people  would still be fascinated with it and know about it, and it would still be on the air?  Obviously, a different context.  When I took the job, actually, my agent's manager, well, you know, we signed a, I signed  a three-year contract, but we thought, oh, you know, in three months, if I don't like  it, you know, I'll leave. 
[02:34:00]  To get the hell out or something.  Yeah, right.  Because cable was in its infancy at the time, too.  It wasn't just, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  So my friends back in L.A. were saying, well, where'd Nina go?  She went to some little music channel.  That's what I said earlier.  So, yeah, God knows, you know.  What it became.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not too crazy about...  How was the money when you first signed?  You don't have to give us numbers, but it was bad.  No, I'm not going to give you numbers.  The numbers were bad to begin with?  No, I didn't think it was that bad because it afforded, at least me, you know, to live 
[02:34:30]  comfortably in New York, and New York's pretty expensive.  It's, you know, I never felt cheated until I left and found out what the next group of  VJs made, like the Julie Browns, and their salaries was like, oh, and I go, wait a minute.  You know, but then it, you know, went the other way.  Yeah, yeah.  The scale went down.  How long were you there?  Five years.  Oh, you were there five years?  Most of the originals were there five years?  Or did anybody, Martha and all of them, how long did they stay? 
[02:35:00]  Well, I left, JJ and I were the first to leave.  I went out to Entertainment Tonight and Solid Gold and a syndicated radio show, actually.  And I'm not sure how many years that the three of them were there without me there.  I think two or three, because once I left, I was so busy with the other stuff.  Right, you didn't pay attention.  I really didn't.  I didn't even watch it.  I don't think it was that long after, though, that they just kind of cleaned house.  Yeah, I would say two years maximum, but I don't know for sure. 
[02:35:30]  What is your greatest memory of being a VJ?  We were talking earlier about when Kiss took off their makeup.  That was such a big moment.  For JJ Jackson.  But what was your big memory that you go back to?  You know, the one that is kind of soul warming, and it's, I know people that ask me the question,  you know, it's kind of a lame answer, but the early days when we were in the first studio, 
[02:36:00]  Teletronics, with the crew, and the feeling, the launch was huge.  I mean, that was big, you know, unforgettable moment.  But it was a free-for-all there, and we had so much fun.  We worked really hard in long hours because it was all experimental.  Yeah, like the crew would throw paper at you and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You'd see, like, things going on.  Water fights, you know, and all these goofy free-for-all.  The bumpers between things never worked.  Sometimes the audio wasn't there.  It was great.  It would just freeze, and you'd come back and just be like, yeah, well, that didn't go well. 
[02:36:30]  Actually, the less professional it was, the more fun.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And once it started getting, like, polished, and then after we left, it was, like, such an attempt  to be, like, too cool for the room.  Then the executives came in and thought to, yeah.  It's like, if you try and be cool right there, you're not cool.  You're not going to be cool.  So we weren't cool.  But we had a lot of fun.  And why did you go to Maine?  Just to escape everything?  Well, I always loved Maine.  We eat lobsters and stuff?  Yeah, I love lobsters. 
[02:37:00]  But I just had always loved Maine, and I really got burned out on L.A.  I don't like heat, and it's hot.  I don't like crowds, and it's crowded.  You know, it's traffic, and just, I was like, you know, a couple of summers.  It's real quiet up there, right?  Oh, it's so quiet.  I was just telling a friend of mine on the telephone, you know, just living there for  four years, and I haven't been to New York since I moved to Maine, and I'm used to the 
[02:37:30]  quiet.  And the first night I was here, I was sitting outside, and I'm going, the ambient noise level,  just the buzz, was like, wow!  Yeah.  You know, and so it was like kind of seeing the city, or hearing the city.  Right.  The city has a rhythm.  It really does.  You've got to get used to it.  We've got to get out of here.  We want to say hi to you, but we have to go do another interview with the Broadway guys  from Ring.  But you guys are doing a whole thing on the 80s channel? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's going to air the first, obviously, and then over Labor Day weekend, but this  was really the time that we could all get together.  Yeah.  And I've got to ask for autographs for Tiny.  Tiny.  Tiny.  Yes.  Tiny's the coolest.  We'll get something for you before the end of the show.  Absolutely.  We'll have something to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Talked with a pleasure, actually.  Thank you, Nina.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to do a quick break, and then we're going to be doing the rain thing in the fishbowl.  Stay there.  All right.  This is the Virus Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, I'm expecting an important call.  That's a good idea.  I've got four cell phones on me.  I've got left mine on the side.  Woo-hoo!  Are we on?  Yes.  Where's our music?  Hi, everybody.  I think we're live.  We're not privy to music in here.  Do we have reverb on our mics, too?  I like that.  CBS FM, Ron Lundy.  Hello, love. 
[02:39:00]  Ron Lundy.  That's going back.  Ron Lundy.  The guy with the cheesecakes, Lundy?  Ron Lundy.  That's Lundy's.  That's Lundy's.  Come on.  Just to set the scene, we're in the fishbowl.  We don't come in here often because it's very uncomfortable.  No.  Sure is.  Not enough space.  But we've got three guys from the Broadway show Rain, and we're very excited to have you guys on our show today.  It's great to be here, guys.  Thank you for having us.  Thanks for having us, Ron.  Is Jimmy's mic on?  No, I don't hear Jimmy.  No?  I don't hear me, either. 
[02:39:30]  I hear you.  Oh, I don't hear you.  I hear you, actually.  Fine.  Now I hear me.  That's good.  Now I hear it.  All I hear is mediocrity from this side of the room.  I just want to have a core of silence, then.  Yes.  Yes.  Now I hear everybody.  Okay, good.  That's much better.  Do you want to introduce everybody?  Yeah.  But then our mics went down.  They can't hear.  I can't hear Jimmy.  Oh.  I just wanted to introduce everybody.  I'll just yell.  All right.  He's just going to introduce us, so go ahead.  I didn't know your name, so who do we have here?  We've got Joey Curitolo.  I play Paul.  We've got Joe Bithorn.  He plays George Harrison.  And David Leon.  John Lennon.  John Lennon.  Very cool. 
[02:40:00]  It's all in.  And this Broadway show is just enormous.  It's cooking, man.  Yeah, people are loving it.  It's been a lot of fun, you know, to be able to bring this music back to the generations  and new ones, three of them, in fact.  It's great.  It is amazing that it just really never went away.  No, it's good stuff.  I mean, it sets the standard.  Yeah, it's not something that you have to come out with and go, hey, you're familiar  with this?  I think everybody knows and is familiar with the Beatles, obviously.  Yeah.  That's great.  We have the best catalog to choose from. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And when we're done, every show, we're missing, like, 20 songs that are people's favorites.  Like, why didn't you do Yellow Submarine?  Why didn't you come back?  Do you mix up the songs, though, from night to night?  We do it in a section of our show.  We have, like, an unplugged section where we can throw stuff in and out.  It keeps us fresh.  Long hour guy.  Long Island?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  How could you tell?  I messed that up.  Long Island.  Sounded more like a Long Island accent.  Which one?  Long Island?  Long Island, I know.  I don't come from Long Island. 
[02:41:00]  I used to live there.  What town?  Cedarhurst.  Cedarhurst?  Nice.  Huntington.  So you guys go through all, you know, a bunch of different eras?  Yeah.  The career.  It's the career of the Beatles in song, through their songs.  Not much dialogue or anything like that.  But it tells the story.  It's a synopsis of the 60s with their music, actually.  Sure.  How is this different from Beatlemania from years ago?  I remember that show.  It's real bands.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're real musicians. 
[02:41:30]  Real musicians.  That makes a difference, I gather.  If the Beatlemania guys didn't know...  I don't think they really played.  Well, yeah.  We were part of it.  You know, we play.  But this is like an all-star cast of that.  It's the best of the best.  Yeah.  Not everybody played.  You know, there were some that were just...  It is better to look like than to sing.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  It is better to look good than to feel good.  It's very good to look like.  What song are you going to do first?  Let's do...  Being that it's so early in the effing morning...  Yeah.  It sure is.  Let's do here comes that song. 
[02:42:00]  Ah, nice.  Here comes the song.  Here comes the song.  It's all right.  Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter. 
[02:42:30]  Little darling, it feels like it since it's been here.  Here comes the song.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Here comes the song.  I say it's all right.  Little darling, it feels like it since it's been here. 
[02:43:00]  Here comes the song.  Here comes the song.  Here comes the song.  I say it's all right.  It's all right. 
[02:43:30]  Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.  Sun, sun, sun, sun, here it comes.  Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.  Sun, sun, sun, here it comes. 
[02:44:00]  Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.  Little darling, I see that ice is slowly melting  Little darling, it feels like this, it's it's been here 
[02:44:30]  Here comes the sun, do-do-do-do  Here comes the sun, I say, it's alright  Here comes the sun, do-do-do-do  Here comes the sun, it's alright  It's alright 
[02:45:00]  Wow, you're hitting me  That's amazing  I think you just sold the Broadway show right there  Troy Kwan can shove it up his ass  One of our guys was bummed that there would be no drums  But we're like, it's gonna be different  Should have a lecture, you can jump  That was amazing  Ringo's expensive  He's a lazy song 
[02:45:30]  He can't even afford to pay him to rehearse  That was just amazing  Is the guy who plays Ringo like the drunk  That you have to kind of get up right before showtime?  He's walking his way over right now  Stumbling around from last night  I say we go right into another song  Yeah, that's phenomenal  Why talk when you guys play like that?  Wow  Blackbirds singing in the dead of night  Take these broken wings and learn to fly  All your life 
[02:46:00]  You were only waiting for this moment to arrive  Blackbirds singing in the dead of night  Take these sunken eyes and learn to see  All your life  You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[02:47:30]  What's the background of the band?  I mean, you guys individually  You bummed around doing the band thing for years and years  Actually, you know, it was an original group  Mark Lewis, our manager  King Red player  Oh, really?  Yeah  Back in the day  It was  They played the likes of ELO  It was a very Beatle-oriented sound group  And they played the L.A. circuit  And it caught  They used to do a Beatle set at the end of the night  In the clubs  And it caught the attention of Dick Clark  And he hired the band to do the soundtrack  To the birth of the Beatles  A movie as a TV movie 
[02:48:00]  A movie, yeah  A TV movie  And since then, the opportunity  And this preceded Beatlemania, actually  Right  So  Wow  This show is the first impersonation, you know, on record  It's the first  The very first tribute act  Yeah  It's not on this tribute act  Now there's plenty of them out there  Yeah  It started from there  And we regrouped with certain Beatlemania people  To keep it, you know, to give it a new lining  And then it's just blossomed from there  How long have you guys been doing the show? 
[02:48:30]  At, uh, in Broadway  What time is it?  We opened in October  Oh, okay  And, uh, we were just supposed to do eight weeks  And then it was very popular  And we extended to 12 weeks  And then we went to 16 weeks  Yeah, now it's, uh, now it's all this  Yeah, yeah  Where exactly is it?  What theater?  We're at the Brooks now  Okay  It's very, very successful  You know, and, uh, we're the only show  Other than Cirque du Soleil  That actually has the, uh, Sony rights to the music  So, okay  So that's, it's very popular  Yeah, other than the show Love in Vegas 
[02:49:00]  We're the only ones that have the rights  Why'd you pick, uh, Reign?  At the time it was spelt R-E-I-G-N  The Reign of a King  Because they did Beatles  It was the flip side of Paperback Rider  Four letters, four Beatles  You know, and the story goes on  People less us all the time  They picked it for us  Yeah  What do you guys, do you guys do Paperback Rider?  In the show?  Well, we do them all  I mean, but we have to pick a certain common denominator  Right  From all the age range  And now that we have a set thing  Because of lighting 
[02:49:30]  Like any Broadway show  You have to stick to it  Yeah  We go on the road  Our show is different no matter  You know, it depends  I mean, we have a national tour now  Yeah  And, well, we've always had the national tour  International  We were the national tour  International  International too now  Going to South Africa  It's, wow  In September  It's moving quite a bit  The music, you know  It's the soundtrack of people's lives  And they don't want it to  It's our classical music  We approach it like, you know  Modern classical music  So, to be able to perform this for generations  Like I said, night after night  Is just, it's amazing for us

[02:52:30]  Yeah  There are places I remember  All my life  Though some have changed  Some forever  Not far better  Some have gone  Some have gone  And some remain  All these places 
[02:53:00]  Have their moments  With lovers and friends  I still can recall  Some are dead  And some are living  In my life  I love them all  I love them all  I love them all  But of all these friends and lovers  There is no one compares with you 
[02:53:30]  And these memories  And these memories lose their meaning  When I think of love  As something new  Though I know I'll never lose affection  For people and things  That went before  I know I'll often stop  And think about them  In my life 
[02:54:00]  I loved you more  In my life  I loved you more  That's one of my favorite Beatles songs, by the way  You sound just like the Beatles  Yeah, it's ridiculous  It's the monkeys, man  Take the last one 
[02:54:30]  There's no  We know any Aussie  No, but we got  Our sound checks  We do everything from the 60s  Everything  Yeah  You'd be amazed  Simon and Garfunkel  Everything  From Tom Jones to the  I love it 
[02:55:00]  Are you bummed you're not lefty?  No, you know what?  I did it  I did it  And it's, you know  Go through your whole day  If you're writing  Go through your whole day  Being a left-handed  You know  It takes away from the integrity  Of the music  Right  It plays piano left-handed, though  Yeah  We thought maybe you should  Just get a mirror  I sing left-handed  But get a mirror  So the audience  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Or just turn your back on  I'd do that 
[02:55:30]  But they laugh at the  You know what?  And you guys do the trippy stuff, too, right?  Everything  Like I Am the Walrus  And all that  Yeah  I Am the Walrus  They're on the show  That's an amazingly scripted  Piece of music  You know  You think about Beatles  Can you take the back  You can't forget about George Martin  Can you take the back  I don't know  Have McCartney seen you guys or Ringo?  I don't know  You know  I think they know of us  Probably YouTube  You know  YouTube stuff  Everybody sees everybody  I really don't know  We saw  Paul McCartney did a show 
[02:56:00]  For Sirius XM  And we were lucky to be there  Wow  And you're watching the guy sing  Let It Be  And you're like  That's the guy  I've heard Let It Be  A million times  By a million bands  And then  You had to pinch yourself  That's the guy  That pretty much started  The whole thing  It's amazing  It's amazing  Started music basically  As we know it  Taught us our instruments  Right  It was unbelievable  What an experience  We were lucky to be there  Have you seen him live  Any of you guys  Yeah  Many times  Oh you have  Oh yeah  Yeah he did the Apollo  It was his first time  It was a really small 
[02:56:30]  Intimate show  It was great  I saw him  I was supposed to go backstage  Actually  I saw him at the Hard Rock  When he opened in Vegas  He'd won about nine shows  That he's contracted  I heard to do  And I was right there  Boom  Why didn't you go backstage?  I got caught up  A friend of a friend of a friend  They got late  To the sound check  Screw the friend  Of the friend  Oh wait  Were they the ones  Getting you in?  Yeah  Oh okay  They were the ones  Getting you in  I gotcha  Do any of you guys  Just go to a karaoke bar  And go  Ha ha  No 
[02:57:00]  That would be good  Ha ha  I heard a story  I'd like to sing  Yesterday  I heard a story  Heard a story  From Drew Carey  That Joe Walsh  Went and did that  Really  And he was doing  Joe Walsh songs  That's hilarious  Yeah that would be  So true  From the front  You look like him  From the back  I know we only had this place  Until 9.30  But maybe we could  Squeeze one more in  Squeeze one more in  Definitely  Where can we be able  Get tickets  Let's get a little  Ticketmaster I guess 
[02:57:30]  Ticketmaster  But it's sold out  For a while now  It's been very good  Thank God  Yeah  Good for you  We've been very lucky  I've just seen her face  I can't forget the time  Or place we just met  She's just a girl for me  I won't know the world  To see you even  Had a feeling of a day  I might have to be  Overway  But I have never been  Well as it is 
[02:58:00]  I'll dream of her tonight  I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd  I'm falling  Yes I'm falling  And she keeps calling  Be back again  I have never known  But like this  I've been alone  And I have just things  And kept out of sight  Other girls  We're never quite like this  Night, night, night  But I'm falling  Yes I'm falling  And she keeps calling  Be back again  Tell your boy 
[02:58:30]  Hey!  Bop, bop, bop, bop  Balling  Yes I'm falling  And she keeps calling  Be back again  Watch it  Watch it  Thank you. 
[02:59:00]  Thank you. 
[02:59:30]  We'll be back again.  Call me.  It's time for me.  Let's keep calling me back again.  Yeah, baby. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  Unbelievable.  I'm absolutely going to go see this.  Yeah.  Come on, everybody.  The New York audiences have been just amazingly gracious and beautiful.  So let's have a party, guys.  And thank you for having us.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Rain on Broadway, Ticketmaster.  And I'm dying to see this.  It's phenomenal.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  Come back and see us again.  When you come to see the show, come back and say hello.  Oh, we certainly will.  It's the cast of Rain, everyone.  We're going to wrap up the show next. 
[03:00:30]  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah.  Ah.  Nice.  Fucking yes.  Nice pickup.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, how good was Rain?  Go ahead.  How good was Rain?  And a tribute to the Beatles on Broadway.  Fantastic.  Three guys with acoustic guitars that didn't look anything like the Beatles playing for us.  And what did you have to say about that, Mars?  Mars was checking out the whole thing from the fishbowl. 
[03:01:00]  Now, this is a visual.  So this is what I saw.  Sure.  No problem.  And this is out of love, guys, right?  Yeah.  All good.  Let's go.  But when I looked in the fishbowl, it looked like three privileged bitches being played for.  Three privileged bitches being played for.  It was weird.  It's three guys just playing for three guys.  They were just sitting there, and we were sitting in front of them like, play for us.  I know.  Asking for requests.  Yeah.  Right.  Good requests, though, by the way, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You came out with a good one.  My life. 
[03:01:30]  That was great.  That's my favorite.  Just like the fucking Beatles.  The vocals are the hard part.  It was amazing.  I would go in my life.  I would throw I am the walrus in my list.  Well, we got to eat a lot of crow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Troy's got to eat a lot of crow.  And a couple of eagles and pigeons.  All right.  So let's start with our rain demands.  Yes.  If you remember, about an hour and a half ago, we came up with demands because, you know,  we are privileged bitches.  That's right.  And we wanted our Beatles experience to be in such a way. 
[03:02:00]  Organic.  Organic.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Right now, I want to go on the record as saying I was influenced by Troy Kwan, and I don't  want this weighing on me too badly.  Right.  When we came up with this list, everything, I was caught up in this Troy Kwan hate.  Right.  The hate.  Right.  That is Troy.  So before we bring Troy in, and don't be confused.  Rain was amazing.  We loved him.  Yes.  We had a whole list of demands.  And I just want to go through the list now and see if a lot of our demands were met. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  Go ahead, Sam.  No two-minute songs.  Well, yeah, we got a couple of those.  I don't think we did get a two-minute song.  I believe that demand was met.  All right, hold on.  I'm making a list.  Demand met.  In my life, they cut short.  They cut out the music solo.  That was about two minutes.  No, I think...  No, what we meant by the two-minute songs were the actual Beatles two-minute songs from  their early days.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll accept that.  Like, I want to hold your hand.  Yeah, I think they met that. 
[03:03:00]  No silly hairdos.  I would say met.  They met that.  They met that.  They didn't come in with any Beatles wigs or anything.  It was their hair and...  At least one beard is required.  Epic fail!  That...  They didn't meet that.  ...did not work.  No fake accents in between songs.  Ah, I heard it.  I heard it, too.  I heard it.  What?  Not in dramatic fashion, though.  No, he was just being silly.  He was fucking around.  It wasn't like they were playing and staying in character, where in between songs they were  like, our next song we'd like to do, we wrote this when we were in Liverpool. 
[03:03:30]  You know, they didn't try to be the guy.  They were having fun with it, so I would say that demand was met.  I don't know, because Opie said he wanted to pull the plug the minute he heard that  accent.  But Opie meant not in them just being funny guys.  All right, maybe I'm all talk and no action, Sam.  Is that what you're getting at?  Like a lot of girls, I know.  I think people understand that by now.  No, that's not what I'm getting at.  Three of our demands were met so far.  Yes.  Okay.  Anyway, no Ringo songs, specifically Yellow Submarine or Octopus Asserts.  MET.  MET.  MET.  Tremendous.  Hit.  Hold on. 
[03:04:00]  No broads, no yokos, you know what we mean.  MET.  Out of the park.  Yes.  So far, what was the one that wasn't met?  At least one beard.  And it was an epic fail.  Yes, it was.  Clean shaven gents.  No sorries or any of that Indian shit.  MET.  MET.  Completely.  God, we did well here.  Well, wall of sound is required.  There was no wall of sound.  What's a wall of sound?  Oh, please.  That's the production value of...  Well, we knew that we wouldn't get that, so that was not met.  Over dubbing, things like that. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  Not met.  At least one lefty is required.  Oh, we're falling off.  We're falling off.  Well, he did say that he did play lefty, but it was ridiculous.  Yeah.  And he went through life as a lefty once.  Is that good enough?  No, no, we didn't get a lefty.  No, we did.  No, we did.  Lefty.  I addressed it.  No, no.  Man, we should have told him to hit the break.  Yeah, take a cake.  Tell your story walking, buddy.  That's right.  Okay, no wacky John Lennon glasses unless the lenses are truly corrective.  Fucking Metaroo.  Absolutely met that one.  John Lennon had sunglasses, but they were just regular sunglasses. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, they were on top of his head and they fell down by a couple times.  That was met.  Yes.  No stumped wives.  Metaroo.  Completely met.  Never met a room.  Met that.  No songs that don't make any sense.  No.  What did they play?  I think they were.  My Life Made Sense.  In My Life, Blackbird Made Sense.  Here Comes the Sun.  Norwegian Wood.  Blackbird.  Blackbird was amazing, right?  Yeah, it was good.  Fuck.  Even Here Comes the Sun, which we bitched about.  We said they would play that.  Oh, God.  It was amazing.  It was their first song.  How smart are we?  Here comes the Sun.  And it was great. 
[03:05:30]  We said they would play that and it was the first song.  It certainly was.  God, we're brilliant.  All right.  That was met or not?  Met.  That was met.  Okay.  No switch outs for the entirety of the segment.  And I don't think this applies.  That was a little weird.  Because I think.  It was weird.  Because one of the songs.  Wait, the one guy was Paul McCartney.  The other guy was definitely Lennon.  And one guy was Harrison in the middle.  And did they switch, though?  No.  Because I don't think they did.  And we know better.  I don't think they did.  No.  The one guy was playing all the Paul McCartney songs.  Although, wait a minute.  The one Lennon song. 
[03:06:00]  Which one?  In My Life was the Lennon song.  Yeah.  McCartney sang backup vocals a little bit.  Always liked the Lennon stuff better than the McCartney stuff.  Wow.  So that was met?  Yeah, I think that was met.  I'm going to go and say it was met.  Nine demands met so far.  Yes.  We're good.  No Pete Best version of the Beatles.  We hate the blues.  And hates the blues.  I hate it.  I think that was met.  Ten demands met.  Oh, boy.  We lost this one. 
[03:06:30]  We massively lost this one.  At least one song must be performed on the roof.  Well, look.  It's not too late.  Maybe they're setting up right now.  Maybe they needed time to set up.  I think we've got to take that one as a loss.  Yeah, me too.  Fuck.  I think we lost that one.  Okay.  And the final demand.  Oh, God.  Band must have four members.  Well, Kenny was sitting at the piano.  He was security.  He really was.  Yes.  Maybe there was a fourth member in there. 
[03:07:00]  There wasn't.  You sure?  That was three guys.  It sounded really good.  Kenny?  I'm the lost Beatle.  A lot of people don't know that.  Yeah.  Sing a Beatles song.  I wish you were the lost security guy.  Kenny's ready to sing.  Paperback writer.  Demand not met.  Demand not met.  All right.  So someone on Twitter said, holy shit, these guys are awesome.  With an N.  Awesome.  That's great.  Do you want to correct us killing everybody out there on Twitter?  It really is.  It's destroying everybody. 
[03:07:30]  No, they could have used it.  They probably have it off.  They don't know that awesome has no N in it.  Autocorrect is a nightmare for all of us.  It's like Anthony's house.  We're all guilty.  Yes.  66% of our demands were met, Ant.  Even though we said if one of those demands were not met, we'd pull the plug immediately.  Yeah.  So we eat a lot of crow today.  And that just shows you how good they were.  Where's Troy?  We weren't able to tell them.  For the final.  Yeah.  Where's Troy?  Go fuck themselves.  Having a little humble pie.  Yes.  A heaping helper. 
[03:08:00]  That's right.  30 days in the home.  That's right.  Where's Troy?  Come on in, man.  Having a crow sandwich.  Troy.  Tiny crow.  Troy Kwan.  Well, no.  I want you to be honest.  Go ahead, Troy.  You heard, first of all, did you hear the performance?  I did.  All four songs?  Yes.  I was in the control.  Maybe five, right?  Four or five songs.  Four, probably.  In My Life, Norwegian Wood, Here Comes the Sun.  They didn't do Norwegian Wood.  Blackbird.  They didn't do Norwegian Wood.  No, they didn't do Norwegian Wood.  They did In My Life.  Right.  I've just seen a face. 
[03:08:30]  I've just seen a face.  Wait, what was the one?  They did fucking Here Comes the Sun.  In My Life.  You've got to hide your love away.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What am I thinking?  Hey!  You've got to hide.  Yep.  Yes.  Troy, what did you think?  I mean, they're professional musicians.  Wait, wait.  I thought they were three jerk-offs.  Three jerk-offs with guitars.  What happened to the three jerk-offs with guitars?  And abortions.  And abortions.  Well, I didn't hear what they were going to do.  I didn't hear the song yet.  Let him be.  Let him be.  Let's shut up.  Okay.  Your review. 
[03:09:00]  Let him be.  They're professional musicians that practice that material day in and day out.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay?  So they know how to play it well.  Yeah.  But I'm a bit of a Beatles snob.  I want to hear those songs as they were written.  If I want to get the full Beatles experience.  That is...  They were excellent.  But that was an interpretation of those songs.  Do you think that they sounded like the Beatles, as far as the voices, they sound like the  Beatles?  They're mimicking the Beatles. 
[03:09:30]  That's what that's for.  Do you think the harmonies were really good?  Yeah.  They're professionals.  And do you think that people that hear that, and that are like you, that want to see the  whole band, will now clamor for tickets to see Rain on Broadway and see that whole thing,  the whole band.  I personally would like to see it on Broadway.  See?  I would like to see it.  So don't you think that kind of worked?  Well, then it did what it had to do.  But like I said, I'm a bit of a Beatles snob.  I want to hear those songs executed the way that they were.  I want to see you executed. 
[03:10:00]  Yes.  The thing is, it's a Broadway show.  They performed two shows yesterday.  They're performing tonight.  But it's hard to get guys singing up at fucking 7.30 in the morning and tell them to come  in and sing when they're going to show tonight.  That don't come in, right, Troy?  And the equipment.  That don't come in.  Oh, boy.  That don't come in, right, Troy?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, if you're going to sell the show early, step up to the plate.  I thought it sounded just like the records.  It didn't sound like the records to you?  Like I said, I'm a Beatles snob.  What would you have liked to see?  I enjoyed them very much.  I would like to have seen them actually play the live instruments. 
[03:10:30]  Full band.  With the guitar, with the, you know, the Rickenbacker guitars, the Vox amps, you know,  the, play it like, like they played it.  But since you've heard other bands do that, wasn't it kind of cool to see three guys, like  I love covers, Sabbath covers, I fucking love it stuff because it's a little bit different.  So these guys are just sitting down playing the guitar and fucking sounding and singing  like, they sang like the fucking Beatles.  That's the hard part.  I've seen dudes sit around and play the guitar and sound like the Beatles.  But not sing as well as that.  Well, I mean, that's their job.  I certainly hope they do. 
[03:11:00]  I love how it went from three, three fucking jerk offs with guitars to, well, that's their  job.  They're professional musicians.  Well, they, I mean, if you're getting paid to be on Broadway, obviously you're a good  musician, right?  But obviously that wasn't obvious before we heard that.  Well, I was angry because I wanted, I expected one thing and I got something else.  Were you impressed?  Surprisingly suppressed.  Surprisingly suppressed.  I gotta go.  You were, you were, you were impressed?  Were you impressed? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I, I enjoy good musicianship.  I appreciate good musicianship.  So yeah, they, they play.  A few jerk offs get together.  It's, it's magic.  Yeah.  You know, a couple jerk offs playing some Beatles songs.  Jerk offs.  Dare I say you might be a little too hip for the room right now.  Oh shit.  Being a hipster.  You are saying musicianship.  And it's like, what does that do?  Sail to the country of musician?  This is a good one, right?  Yeah, that was good.  We got Steve in Rhode Island.  Steve, you're on with Troy Kwan.  I'm in Philly having a cheesesteak out of a man's pants. 
[03:12:00]  What?  I said, Troy Kwan is a hipster douchebag.  Whoa.  Yeah, it sounded great out there, didn't it, Steve?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Great.  Fuck you.  Oh.  Maybe you can press play at your next DJ.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh, man.  People picking up.  Picking up on Roland's shit right there.  Picking up on Roland's shit.  Roland, do you feel like you got a victory today? 
[03:12:30]  A little vindication?  A little vindication?  Well, no.  For Leeds, too.  I mean, he saw a play and told me about us online.  Yeah, they were excellent.  I liked them.  Now, how do you feel, though, about you and Troy?  Do you feel that you came out looking like the guy that knew what he was talking about?  Like the guy that knew what he was talking about?  And Troy smells like shit, right?  Yeah.  Some people talk out of their ass.  That's cool.  Oh, Troy.  Talking out of my ass because I want to hear the songs executed professionally.  Let me say it like you.  Roar.  Listen to me, people.  Roar. 
[03:13:00]  Roar.  It's like scary, scary, scary, scary.  Roar.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't even know what you're doing.  He's making fun of your old band, Troy.  Oh.  You know.  And then you go.  Roar.  Roar.  And then people go, what was that?  Clap.  Roar.  Roar.  He's saying.  I can't do it because he does really good.  Yeah, he does.  Troy, do you want to give him a scream?  Nah.  I can't because he does awesome scream.  No, I said Troy.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Because he's making it sound like all you do is go roar.  No, it's like roar.  Roar.  Roar.  Wow.  All right.  Dave in New York really wants to talk to you.  It's in capital letters.  Oh, cool.  Dave in New York.  Go ahead.  I talked to Weiss in the going to the show when I saw it in the auditorium theater because  he was doing the Troy Kwan thing.  Texted or emailed me back and said, my brother, he goes, you were so right.  Let me tell you something, Troy Kwan.  First of all, you're a kid.  Second of all, no one has ever seen Sergeant Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, or any of that 
[03:14:00]  shit performed live.  It was all studio stuff.  I have, you fucking idiot.  I have.  I saw the Fab Faux do it start to finish.  Fuck you.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Go to see this.  And you, and when you sit there and you watch it, and then maybe you might get a little  age on you, and you'll understand that this is as close as anybody's ever going to get  to seeing these four guys doing this show.  All right.  Good.  Wait a minute.  I want to see it.  Hold on a second, though.  The thing is, when you see the Fab Faux, you're seeing a live version of how the record 
[03:14:30]  sounds.  When you see these four guys playing, when the Beatles were on stage, I don't think  they had all of their studio instruments.  They had all four guys.  They weren't on stage past 1966, so all that material never got performed live.  Because they knew they couldn't do that stuff live.  That was one reason why they stopped touring.  Yeah, they said Shea Stadium was only like 25 minutes long.  Yeah, it was short.  But I'm saying, like, even the rooftop performance, they didn't have all their instruments up there and  sound exactly like the record.  Well, those songs didn't have crazy instrumentation.  It was what was going to be called the Get Back record, and they were going back to just 
[03:15:00]  the basics.  Yeah, they were stripping it down, right, Troy?  But it did sound different than the record.  Going back to basics.  These guys sound like the Beatles live.  Yeah.  These four guys sound like the Beatles live.  Yeah.  They were great, Troy.  Yeah.  If you want the record, you get the Fab Faux.  If you want to see what it might be like to see the four Beatles on a stage performing these  songs, you go see these four.  Right?  Again, no one has ever seen this stuff live, because they never did it live.  They passed Rubber Soul, and I'm telling you, it's great.  Well, that's not, first of all, that's not true. 
[03:15:30]  You have no idea what you're talking about.  Ooh.  Because they played up to Revolver.  They were playing, Shea State, the last show was in San Francisco in 1966, August 1966.  Oh, I got that.  Someone read Wikipedia.  Face.  So before you call in and try to talk shit, know what you're talking about, asshole.  Oh, man.  Dave, I'm sorry about that.  Face you, fucker.  Sorry about that, Dave.  Hardcore.  I got sold on the Reign thing.  Yeah, me too.  I was Team Fab Faux.  I'm not sure what team I'm on now. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, they say you guys can go see any time you want.  Fab Faux is very good, but there's eight of them.  I think this battle is not going to be settled today.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not.  No.  I want to hear fucking just the four guys out there strumming away.  Ba-ga-ba-ga-ba-ga-ba-ga-ba-ga.  Jimmy.  Ba-ga-ba-ba-ga-ba-ga-ba-ga.  We only had three.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I want to go to see Reign.  The Reigno guys, the big catch.  There's 30 of them at the fucking different eras and stuff.  I'm going to go to the Reign play.  I am.  Kenneth, well, wait.  Shh, shh, shh.  If you go see Reign, you got to bring umbrellas. 
[03:16:30]  It's raining.  You want to start our vacations?  I certainly do.  Yeah.  Do you get it?  Troy, any final thoughts?  I got that, I think.  Oh, no final thoughts.  You're hosting the 10 o'clock hour today, sir.  Depends on where the wheel lands.  Why don't we spin the wheel as we're...  Do you want to spin it here?  Why not there, Sam?  How come Travis is moving to his right instead of going under the table to spin the wheel?  It's under to the right.  And how pissed off is E-Rock?  Has anyone talked to E-Rock in the last episode?  Why is he mad?  He's really upset.  It's the day to the day he's finally had it.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[03:17:00]  Why is he mad?  He doesn't like the Twitter account.  He's furious.  No, he's not.  Is he mad, Roland?  He was mad, yeah.  Troy, is he mad?  I haven't talked to him.  I think he's just had enough.  Of what?  Just a lambasting.  To make him feel better, you almost got 1,000 followers.  Where?  Sex Buzzer.  Thanks on Twitter.  Well, now we got 1,000.  Thank you, Roland.  Oh, at Sex Buzzer.  Yeah.  If you want to keep track of when E-Rock arrives, it comes into work.  We have one tweet so far.  What does it say?  Today's time, 541 a.m. Eastern. 
[03:17:30]  I don't know who's in charge of this Twitter, by the way.  Oh, no.  I just found it.  How come that's funny, though, that that picture got up there pretty quick?  Yeah.  Listeners are good these days.  That's a fast one.  So, Travis, you spin the wheel and then Telefax the name to this computer?  Yep.  Okay.  I'll do.  I'm following, by the way, at Sex Buzzer.  I'm following.  Oh, yeah.  I'll check it.  I won't follow it.  Oh, I'm following.  I'm following.  Got to follow.  Yeah.  Updates.  Let's start our 4th of July.  No, we're spinning the wheel.  Are you going to spin it now? 
[03:18:00]  I don't give a shit.  It's fake.  It's a fake electronic wheel.  It's a fucking sound effect.  It's a sound effect.  It's the magic of radio.  And then they pick the guy that they already picked because the other people aren't even  fucking here.  It's the magic of radio.  Like, we just saw the guys from Rain.  There were four guys in that room.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  All right.  Push the button.  And then let's have Troy Kwan do the show because it's going to be Troy.  If you guys aren't going to take the wheel seriously, maybe we should do it on 10 o'clock  hour.  Oh, really?  The 10 o'clock hour.  Guys, spin the wheel.  Opie, by the way, halfway through the spin, shut the volume off and watch it just go 
[03:18:30]  click and stop.  Why don't you think the wheel won't stop?  It'll just keep spinning.  No, because the wheel is mic'd.  Oh, that's why.  So you turn the volume off.  Just turn the mic off.  Oh, right.  The wheel has to be mic'd.  I see.  All right, let's go.  Can I ask you something?  Sure.  Could you spin the wheel one full rotation at a very slow speed?  Just make it go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  You just greased it up.  No, no, don't spin it.  Just hold a prong on it. 
[03:19:00]  One of the prongs.  Yeah.  And go click, click, click, click, click, click, click one full time around at the same  exact rotation speed.  And go.  Yeah.  Travis has greasy fingers.  He's not going to be able to hold it.  Anthony, even better.  I can give a shot.  Why can't we bring the wheel right in here?  Let one of us spin it.  Bring it in here.  Travis, bring the wheel in here.  It weighs really heavy.  And you guys know me.  Bring the wheel in here.  Jimmy wants to spin the wheel.  I want to spin the wheel.  It weighs 350 pounds.  All right.  So bring Eric in.  Come on.  Sorry, Iraq. 
[03:19:30]  See, that's what I was talking about.  Oh, no.  Look out.  Look out.  Oh, there was just a car crash here in the studio.  Wow.  But that was a good line.  No, that wasn't it.  No, he means that there was a natural car crash.  That's just a dumb sound effect.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, but it's real, right?  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought so.  Well, Troy, I'm going to look forward to listening to you on the way home, hosting the show.  Let's make this official.  I'd spin the wheel.  And Troy gets a guess if he gets picked.  Yeah, let's spin the wheel.  Well, whoever gets picked.  All right.  What?  Can't find it?  Can't find the wheel?  I got the wheels right here.  I'm waiting for you guys to be quiet so you can hear the wheel. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Spin the wheel.  Thank God.  Slowly.  It sounds...  I don't want it to sound exactly like the last wheel spin.  Yeah.  I can spin it slowly for like a little while.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Spin it for a little bit.  20 minutes.  See?  He spun it a little slower.  He spun it a little bit there.  Is that proof enough?  All right.  Let's spin it for real.  It's proof enough.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah!  Spin, bro.  Good spin.  Good spin.  Nice spin.  Wow.  That was a great spin. 
[03:20:30]  Well, this sounds just like what he just played before.  I mean, spun before.  Same wheel.  And it lands on...  Hang on.  I gotta tell Sam.  Okay.  Just put it on my headphone.  Really?  Oh.  Well, I'll have you guys know that the random wheel has chosen for today's host...  Uh-huh.  It will be...  Who?  Roland.  I'm telling you, it's Troy!  Yeah!  Troy!  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I did not see that coming.  I did not see that coming. 
[03:21:00]  You never know where this wheel's gonna go.  Wow.  Yes, it do.  Troy.  No, you don't chip.  That's right.  What do you got planned for the 10 o'clock hour, Troy?  Wheel sound effect.  What is this?  The 40s?  Nick Cannon's coming in, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's a big maybe right now.  Huh.  We saw him walk by the fishbowl.  Oh, we don't know if he's coming in.  Yes, he's at 1025.  I'm probably gonna leave.  Except...  Stay.  No, I have a flight.  Well...  I have to get on a fucking big plane.  Oh.  How big is it?  Fucking big enough for... 
[03:21:30]  It's a new plane.  It's got like 4,000 seats.  4,000?  It's a CB-552 or something.  Oh, those are good planes.  Chip lies sometimes.  He doesn't even tell jokes.  Chip lies all the time.  He lies to impress people.  I want to get a picture with Nick Cannon.  Yeah.  There might be a delay.  Nigerian man arrested after flying from New York to L.A.  That's all right.  Nigerian man.  Stole away.  Where did he...  How did he...  Had at least 10 boarding passes.  That's good.  That's wonderful.  Noi B.  What the hell is he up to?  His name is...  Oh, I know him. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, he's there.  Noi B.  Maybe he was going to L.A.  to deliver a million dollars to some lucky person that inherited it from Nigeria savages.  Nah, those things are all scams, dude.  Are they?  I didn't know that.  Troy, 10 o'clock hour.  What do you got planned?  Let's talk some music.  Let's talk...  Let's keep it going.  Let's talk...  Holy shit.  He's Carol Miller.  That lingers longer.  I don't want...  I really don't want to do this.  I mean, I offered to do it.  Oh, boy.  I'll do it.  I'll step up.  But, uh...  Is there going to be more Beatles talk? 
[03:22:30]  I would assume he should...  If I were Troy, I would talk about what happened with the Beatles and the whole thing today.  I would find out from E-Rock if he's upset and who he's upset with.  I'll do a little bit of Blake Shelton.  I'd see if there's any beef between him and Roland since they got into a fight.  Yeah, there's all that inside shit you got to take care of now, Troy.  Yeah.  You got to get E-Rock on.  You got to talk to Roland, Beatles stuff.  Yeah, you're on it.  Sure.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  My headphones are off, mother...  Yeah, we'll see you guys in a few days.  I just almost totally...  I'll try your long fucking footsteps right away. 
[03:23:00]  Jimmy's flying to Seattle.  My headphones are off.  He's going to be on BJ Shea's morning show tomorrow on...  What?  K-I-S-S-S-W.  I cast W and then...  We broke a thousand on Sex Buzzer!  Yeah!  Sex Buzzer.  Antisocial is going to be in Seattle.  Paramount Theater Friday night and then Sunday night Las Vegas.  I'm going to UFC Saturday, so...  Fuck.  You got a great weekend.  Yes, I do.  All right, guys.  We'll see you soon.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:23:30]  Damn it.  On The Virus.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.B. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  It's After O.B. and Anthony Live.  I won again, Sam.  For those of you...  Yeah, right.  For those of you that missed it, we spun the wheel, ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:24:00]  The wheel of hosts...  This week, we've been spinning the wheel to find out who hosts the After Show.  I don't want to spin the wheel.  I just want to host it myself.  But they wanted to...  O.B.  Ron, they came up with this idea to spin the wheel of hosts, which I'm more than happy to do.  Troy Kwan.  Yes.  Ended up winning the contest today.  I didn't win?  No, Roland.  It's not about you.  I go poo-poo then.  All right.  Get out of here.  Troy, you won. 
[03:24:30]  Your name came up on the wheel.  Yep.  Go for it, buddy.  Can I have some music?  Should I...  Can we start that over?  No.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Troy Kwan here.  Guest hosting today.  I can't wait till Sam is back.  Um, because Sam does do a good job with it.  And, uh, I gotta give Sam some props for what he does.  So, as we discussed today, uh, we had Rain in. 
[03:25:00]  And, uh, some people were...  Hey, give me a call.  Uh, call at the show.  Let's see what we have to say.  I'm sure there's a lot of angry people out there for, uh, for what happened and some  of the things they said.  But you know what?  Look, I'm, uh, like I said, I'm a bit of a Beatles snob.  I like to hear the songs that they were, as they were recorded.  And, uh, you know, it was a different interpretation of them.  And I'm not mad at that.  And I'd love to see the show.  I'm excited to see it.  And hopefully I will.  So I can give you an update.  But, uh, so the first, first topic, let's discuss Beatles call up. 
[03:25:30]  And, uh, let's start with number, number one, 9-1-7.  You're on the air.  Who's this, Troy?  Yeah, what's up, dude?  What's up?  It's Rob Devaney from Carnegie Hall.  What's happening, man?  I gotta agree with you on one thing.  What's up?  That, uh, like, it's like if you go to a Yankee game and you see fucking, you go to  see A-Rod and then you show up and I'm playing third base hitting cleanup, you're not gonna  be happy, right?  Right.  But the Beatles aren't together anymore.  Two of them are dead.  Um, but I wanted to hear it the way that it was written. 
[03:26:00]  That it was executed on the album, so.  Can I, can I ask a quick question?  Do you want, do you want to fuck me?  Do you want me to fuck me?  Fuck me in my ass?  Come on, fuck me, cop guy, you hipster.  Fuck, come on.  Fuck you, fucking cop.  You fuck, you fuck.  You want to fuck me, Troy?  Scream for me.  That's Scream for me, you fuck.  You still have?  Uh, number, number four.  Uh, 703, you're on the air.  Hi.  Hello.  I just want to say, I have been Team Troy Kwan ever since you hopped into bed with that 
[03:26:30]  god-awful, faggy Canadian Jew.  Canadian Jew.  Huh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  All right.  No, no.  What am I supposed to say?  Uh, 302, you're on the air.  Hi.  Uh, Troy?  Yo.  Uh, don't ever apologize for being a purist.  I mean, you want things clear, unadulterated.  You want what you want. 
[03:27:00]  Yes.  And don't ever apologize for that.  And I mean you no disrespect, and I don't mean any other guys any disrespect.  But for God's sakes, where is our Hollywood primetime Sammy Sweetheart Roberts?  And he got fucking so hosed on the Busted Open show.  That was total fucking bullshit.  Well...  Thanks, Tron.  Don't ever fucking apologize, man.  All right.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  And, yeah, but I think this week actually is really good because people can see that  how good... 
[03:27:30]  Sam really does do a good job, and he's able to, you know, keep the show together, keep  it moving, make it fun, make it interesting.  And, uh, you know, but hey, screw it.  We're going to have some fun today.  So, uh, let's go to number one, 541.  You're on the air.  Yo.  Go ahead.  Hey.  What's going on, Troy?  What's up, dude?  Nothing, man.  One, you're going to be the only one that's in a hurry for Sam to get back.  But two, I just had a question, like, as far as them kind of doing the music they want  to do, I mean, you DJ for a living, therefore kind of change the music the way you want it, 
[03:28:00]  I mean, to pump up the crowd or whatever you want to do.  So how does that differ from someone just wanting to do, say, Beatles acoustically?  Well, basically what I do with DJing is I take songs that are already recorded by the  artists, and I rearrange them in a different way and just create an atmosphere at a party  or at a club or whatever.  And I just have fun with manipulating the sound that's already recorded.  If I'm going to be performing something and claiming to be like the original artist, I 
[03:28:30]  would like it to be like the original.  And that's just my opinion.  And I'm entitled to it.  You know, I'm a musician that plays music, and especially with something as sacred as  the Beatles catalog.  You know, I mean, it's the holy grail of rock and roll.  And you like good musicianship, as you said.  Yes, yes.  And I get that.  I mean, I think people just, you know, put them so high up on that pedestal, as they should,  but I mean, I don't see a problem with someone just kind of taking their own unique spin on  it.  And I say we do the summer of the wheel and keep this thing going. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, thanks for the call, man.  I appreciate it, dude.  I know Chip wants to guest host one day, and I know that Uncle Paul very much wants to  guest host.  First, let's do number two, 978.  You're on the air.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up?  Yo.  I was wondering what you thought of alternative country, like Hank 3 and stuff like that.  Do you enjoy that music at all?  Not really. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, I like Johnny Cash a lot, old country music.  Some of the new country, I never really got into.  Hank 3's cool.  I mean, I know that he's done some stuff with Phil Anselmo, and he actually likes a lot  of metal, so I definitely respect that, but I just never really got into country.  It's just never really my thing.  I like Johnny Cash, too.  It's kind of hack country, but that's what I love, too.  That's my, you know.  Yeah.  But people are like, you don't like country if you only like Johnny Cash, but I really  just like Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  Lucinda Williams, I like one song.  Does that count?  I like the Oak Ridge Boys. 
[03:30:00]  Are they country?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Okay.  I like them.  So there's two.  Two artists.  Okay.  Who's next?  Number four.  Let's go to number four.  814.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  Hey, Troy.  Yo.  I was wondering, do you get up to Happy Valley to do any DJing?  Where's that?  State College, Pennsylvania.  I have not been up there, but if you know of anybody, tell them to hit me up.  I'll definitely come up there and rock in State College. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  You can find me, Troy Kwan, on Facebook and Twitter.  All right.  Thanks, dude.  What are you doing, Uncle Paul, for me?  I'm punching out.  Quiet.  Let's take number seven here.  Ken.  Yo, Ken.  What's up, dude?  Hi.  Hey, Troy, buddy.  What's your favorite Beatles album?  It's hard to say, man.  I mean, they're all so different.  Somebody tell Jimmy Neutron to get a haircut.  We're alone.  I mean, if I had to narrow it down, I'd probably say, 
[03:31:00]  the White Album, but then I'll listen to Abbey Road and say, oh, shit, this is, you know,  language.  Let's do number nine.  Troy can't complain about.  Go ahead.  Jeff, go ahead.  Jeff and Philly.  Troy.  Do you prefer Jeff or Jeffy?  I like Jeffy.  Okay.  Jeffy's good.  You say you like the original sound, you're a purist, but didn't you make a career out of doing the Humpy Dance for five years?  Well, yeah, I mean, that's not my shining moment musically, but, you know, whatever. 
[03:31:30]  I mean, I had fun.  I was a kid.  I was in a rap group.  What are you going to do?  I'm not bragging about it, but, you know, whatever.  Let's start at one.  This guy's going to yell at me.  Go ahead.  John in Virginia.  Yes.  Troy, I would like to tell you how awesome you are.  I'm Opie Ant Fan on Twitter.  Okay.  I'm Opie Ant Fan on Twitter, and I'd like to give a shout out to Kenny Turner. 
[03:32:00]  Hello.  Kenny Turner.  What's up, dude?  All right.  There you go.  We don't know Kenny Turner.  We don't know what he does.  Space Tracker.  I think that's Space Trucker.  How are you doing?  What's up, buddy?  I just wanted to call, and I'm sort of with the majority here, but I'm still in your camp.  They were very competent musicians.  I'm in my late 50s.  I watched the Beatles on Ed Sullivan Live. 
[03:32:30]  But there's a hundred groups in the country that can play the Beatles music well.  They didn't show me anything.  I'm still in your camp.  You just can't pretend to be the Beatles.  Right.  To be a band, go ahead.  All I was saying is, if you're going to be a Beatles cover band, if you're going to be  performing the Beatles music as the quote-unquote Beatles, it needs to be accurate. 
[03:33:00]  In my opinion.  In my opinion.  I mean, I've seen a bunch of bands that dress up like the Beatles, and they're not that  accurate, but it's more of a visual thing.  And it's like, okay, cool.  You see the guys with the mop tops on stage with suits.  I mean, that's cool, but I don't know.  Like I said, I really want to see the Broadway musical, and I'll give you an opinion on it  after I see it.  Then we can determine what camp you're in, sir.  The hotline is ringing.  Yes.  I know who this is.  Go ahead.  Dude, I like to read a Beatles, man, dude. 
[03:33:30]  Don't you have to get lunch?  Isn't it about that time?  Let's go number six.  Kiss him.  RC in Missouri.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Troy.  Yo.  I think they've cut Opie and Anthony down an hour.  Now, they need to cut Ron and Fez down an hour and make the Sam Roberts live show an  hour longer. 
[03:34:00]  I mean, I don't want to cut Ron and Fez down.  I think Sam should have his own show.  I think he does a great job.  But, yeah, I mean, Sam all the way.  Thanks, RC.  There you go.  Good call, RC.  It's number seven.  Very valuable.  I like that.  Let's go to Mark in Iowa.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, Troy, a little constructive criticism here.  I think that you're trying, but really, don't ever come back on the air.  That doesn't sound very constructive.  I would love to have Sam come back full time and maybe expand his time. 
[03:34:30]  And if you just stayed off the radio, it would be better for all of us.  All right.  Well, I'll take that into consideration, Mark.  Thank you for your call.  Let's do Nathan in New York.  Oh, good.  My time's almost done.  Is that what they're saying?  No, no, no, no.  You're the interviewer.  Nathan in New York.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you today?  What's going on?  Troy, I was wondering, are you familiar with sexbuzzer.com?  Is that actually a website? 
[03:35:00]  I'd like to know.  It most certainly is.  Yeah.  I'm not familiar with sexbuzzer.com.  I know that sexbuzzer on Twitter, right?  The unfortunate thing is that some of the responses just won't be sent out to everybody.  So I wanted to offer a place to leave some week-up calls for Eric.  Okay.  I wonder if somebody actually bought sexbuzzer.com already.  I most certainly did.  Oh, good for you, man.  Maybe people could go there and share their Eric memories.  I hope they will. 
[03:35:30]  Let's talk to Henry in Atlanta.  Good thing Chip is here.  Henry!  I was wondering, Chip Chipperson, where do you get all your good material from?  And I want to know if there's any more Uncle Pauly productions in the works.  It just comes from my life.  I'm trying to tell you something.  You keep stepping all over me like I'm a dinosaur dragon or something.  See, just like that.  It just kind of comes out natural.  Oh, nice.  I love it.  It just comes out natural.  We need an Uncle Pauly soundboard on the internet.  It just kind of comes like I'm organic, like a piece of fruit or something. 
[03:36:00]  It's not like a banana.  They call me Chip a banana.  That's great.  See, I can just riff.  Bye.  All right, Henry.  Thanks.  I want to talk to Bubba in Texas.  He fucking hates my guts.  Go ahead, Bubba.  Oh, thanks, Troy.  You know, I used to hate Sam, but you've definitely taken that number one spot now.  You need a tighter fucking shirt and some more hipper fucking clothes.  I mean, listen.  Look at you.  Dude, look at your fucking name. 
[03:36:30]  Bubba.  Like, you've got to fucking be kidding me.  You're going to call me up and say some dumb shit and your name is Bubba?  Really?  Come on, dude.  What the fuck do you think I'm going to call myself?  I'm from Texas, asshole.  And you're probably a big, fat, stupid piece of shit, too.  Wow, you're clever, man.  Well, I mean, look at your name.  Great name.  Who do you think is listening to the show, asshole?  Well, you called, fuckface.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Let's go to number one.  Jim in Riverdale. 
[03:37:00]  Go ahead, buddy.  Troy, good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Would you rather see the fab foe or would you rather see John Rice's crippled cock?  You want to fuck me?  Hang up on me.  You want to fuck me, Troy?  You fuck.  You fucking cock, sucker.  No, no.  Keep it going.  Let him go.  You fucking cock, sucker.  Come on.  Keep going.  Keep going.  All right.  Jim from Riverdale gets the call of the day. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  Let's see here.  Pick one, Sam.  Okay.  There you go.  Okay.  North Carolina.  Go ahead.  You're on there.  Yeah.  I mean, I think the boys keep you around just for the fun of it.  I don't know if it's the character that you play.  I mean, uh...  What's the character?  What, what, what?  Because I'm honest with...  It's a gay florist.  And yesterday it was Barry Diller, the conservative minister. 
[03:38:00]  And the day before it was another gay something or other.  If you can see the theme here.  This is gay!  Oh, that's not nice.  This is just...  This is a runaway train here.  I don't know what to do.  All right.  We'll do one more.  We have a...  Do we have a guest coming in?  Three minutes.  Three minutes.  Okay.  You got time.  Yeah, plenty of time to take more calls.  Sam, go ahead.  Jim's here.  You can talk to him.  You don't have to.  I don't know.  I'm just...  I'm having fun just getting... 
[03:38:30]  Okay.  I talk to Jim all the time.  There you go.  Jay in Cleveland.  Go ahead.  Hey, Troy.  I got a question for you.  How do you want to have bands sound like the original when you've remade Humpty  dance?  It wasn't all that good.  Well, first of all, there was another caller that already had that statement, so...  I may have been on hold or, like, his process through when he did it.  Well, like I said to the other guy, it's not my finest moment musically, but I was a kid. 
[03:39:00]  I was a kid in a rap group.  Yeah.  You know, we were signed to a label.  We were on tour.  We were having fun.  And, I mean, look.  Just a baby.  I mean, it's just...  You didn't know no better.  Not reinventing the wheel here.  Just having some fun, buddy.  Yeah.  Just getting to know each other.  I got another question for you.  From one DJ to another, are you still using vinyl, or are you switching over to that MP3 
[03:39:30]  frame?  No, I do everything on Ableton.  And I have an APC-40, and I control everything from there, and I have a couple outboard effects  and whatnot.  So, everything is done in Ableton.  Come on.  Go back to original.  Well, I mean, vinyl.  It's like...  It's the new way of doing things.  It's fun.  You can do a little bit more shit on the fly, and have fun with manipulation on the fly.  So, that's...  Yeah, but do you know how creative you have to be to come up and do some of the stuff that 
[03:40:00]  you're doing, or like DJ Girl Talk is doing, and you're doing it on vinyl, and how free  fans have to have everything...  Yeah, but Girl Talk doesn't use vinyl.  I don't...  Yeah.  But all the great...  All the good DJs...  All the classic DJs...  Yeah, classic.  It's...  It's a new era.  You know, technology advances.  You move forward with technology.  You don't have to keep doing things the way they were done always before.  You know, you can experiment with new things.  But see, this goes back to the original argument, that you want to hear the Beatles back in the 
[03:40:30]  original form, but DJs can...  But it's like saying, if the Beatles were here today, would they be using technology of  the 60s, or would they be using technology from today?  I guarantee they'd be using the technology from today.  Well, look at McCartney.  He's probably using today's technology.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And McCartney's always pushing the boundary still music.  I mean, the Fireman record was fucking brilliant.  It was all done on a computer.  So...  Really?  Ukulele?  Really?  Well, it's an instrument.  I mean, he uses different instruments.  You know, it's...  He uses instruments for certain songs.  Say that again, bud. 
[03:41:00]  Never mind.  Bad joke.  I'm not going to repeat it.  I didn't hear you.  What'd you say?  Jim didn't hear it.  What do you think?  I'm stupid.  I'm a little...  If you're listening to this show, yes.  All right, man.  Hey, Jay, thanks for the call, buddy.  All right.  Do we have time for another call, or...  Yeah.  Okay.  Pick one.  Go ahead.  Josh in Rochester.  Go ahead, bud.  Hey, Troy, man.  You're awesome.  Screw these other guys.  I love you on liquid metal.  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, you're fucking awesome, man.  Keep up the good work. 
[03:41:30]  And Jimmy, B-I-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  Atta boy.  That's the way to bring it home.  Bill Tetley songs that hit in all corners.  Thanks, Josh.  I appreciate it, man.  I was just waiting for the screaming and the fuck you asshole, the...  So do we have a guest, or are we...  What's going on?  I like...  We'll just keep talking until he walks in.  Okay.  There's no pressure.  So you really like the performance from those guys?  I did.  I thought they sounded like the Beatles.  I understood that there was three acoustics, and, you know...  The voices, to me, are the hard part. 
[03:42:00]  You can mimic the instruments.  I mean, but to sound like them is the hardest part.  Yeah.  And they did.  Vocally.  Yeah.  That's all I cared about.  Yeah, I'm definitely excited to see it.  I think it's going to be great.  I mean, you know, it's cool to see them with the costumes, and you sit back and, you  know, smoke a little weed, hang out, you know?  Whatever.  But, uh...  I'd rather see Motorhead, but, I mean, I will happily see.  I've gotten into Broadway more.  After, uh, seeing Chris Rock's play and fucking Robin Williams, I've just gotten into going 
[03:42:30]  to Broadway.  It's fun.  I hate saying that.  Gay.  I know.  Probably.  I think I'm coming out.  Yeah.  Slowly.  You're maturing.  Yeah.  There you go.  You know.  Growing up.  All right.  Another call, or what did you say?  I am a rooty-tootie.  Why don't we talk to Eric?  Is Eric in there?  Eric, get on mic, buddy.  What?  You all right?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Nothing.  Your show.  No, I'm talking...  I know, it's my show, so I'm talking to you.  So, what's going on?  Why do you seem so upset today, my sweet?  I'm fine.  No, go ahead.  No, seriously.  What's up, dude?  Nothing. 
[03:43:00]  Get it off your chest.  You seem upset.  It's not been a good day.  All right, shut up.  We have a guest coming.  I'm just kidding.  Is he coming in?  I'm just kidding.  All right.  I'm going to take the reins.  Just because we have history with...  Unless you watch for it.  I mean, we have history with him.  No, that's fine.  I figured...  This is legend.  This is...  I mean, this is history making right now.  It is.  Because Nick Cannon is in the Opie and Anthony studio.  What's going on, baby?  How you doing, Nick?  Nick Cannon, do you know Jim?  Yeah.  This is Jim.  This is Troy.  I'm Sam. 
[03:43:30]  What up, man?  It's a pleasure to meet you.  Sit down.  We're not here to attack you.  We love...  I like when you guys attack me.  You do?  This is what...  We've...  Actually, I'm a fan.  Even though you guys attack me.  Of the Opie and Anthony show?  I am.  I'm a fan of people who do good radio.  Mm-hmm.  So...  Then you would have wanted nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, were you expecting us to attack you when you started at 92.3?  Of course.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  You guys were supposed to attack me.  I didn't expect it to be as crazy as it was, though. 
[03:44:00]  Everybody, even like on Twitter with the W.O.W. stamps, I'm like...  Do you hear from our fans a lot?  Too damn much.  Yes.  Are they at least courteous?  No.  But they're funny, so I love it.  They are funny.  They are hilarious.  And they actually get mad when I tell them how funny they are.  Uh-huh.  Like, damn it, he's not offended.  Because they want you to be an asshole to them so they can hit you back.  Yeah, I'm an asshole.  That's what we do, man.  I've been doing comedy all my life.  Like, I get it.  But is there any part of, like, when our fans start getting on you for a bit or when  we take one of your bits and tear it apart, do you sit there going, yeah, that 
[03:44:30]  really wasn't that funny?  Well, you know what it is?  Because there's...  And people have to understand this.  I'm pretty sure they do.  There's, like, rules that you have to follow, especially on regular radio, that you guys  really don't have to follow.  So, if I...  I mean, like, you guys even think that they got on me for saying I have a talent coach.  Yeah, we hammered you pretty hard for saying you're a talent coach.  And it was like, first of all, you got to understand, when I first started, maybe like a year and a  half ago, I don't even...  I'm just...  It's new. 
[03:45:00]  So, anybody who has an opinion or thing, I'm taking it in.  It's like, okay, because I've never hosted a morning radio show before.  So, then as you get...  You know, as I get comfortable and like, oh, okay, that was a trash bit.  I'll never do that again.  But it's...  And that's the beauty of radio.  You grow and you live on the air every morning.  So, I appreciate it.  How did you come to get the gig?  Did they actually just call you and go?  Or did you pursue it?  Nah, I mean, I've always been a fan of radio.  I mean, I was like one of those kids who interned at radio, you know, when I was trying to do  stand-up and stuff as a teenager.  So, when I got to a position, especially when I got to New York, and I knew I was kind of 
[03:45:30]  going to be, you know, not on the road and stuff as much or doing too many movies, I was like,  yo, I would love to do morning radio.  And so, I started kind of fishing around.  I was even going to do something on SiriusXM.  But then I was like, yo, it's a new station.  Let me rock over here.  And that's how it happened.  What did you think, honestly, between us in the room here, when 92.3 Now came to you  and said, we have this idea for The Fugitive.  That was before me. 
[03:46:00]  I wasn't there yet.  I was confused by that just like everybody else.  Because we played a lot of Fugitive audio.  We had our own character that posed as The Fugitive.  Also, the other gag that we kind of poked fun at you a little bit for was the phone number thing.  No.  Okay.  Now, let's talk about this.  Yeah, because we're...  How fake do you actually think that is?  We think it's 100% fake.  So, I don't have that phone in my house?  We don't think so.  Now, you don't think I got enough money to make sure that that number actually rings at 
[03:46:30]  my house and that I actually see that?  I think you have enough money to do that.  And why not, though?  To make sure that it's not fake.  That phone actually rings in my house.  Now, do I answer it?  Ever.  No.  No.  Like, it might as well just be a voicemail box.  It actually is a voicemail box.  We have several lines in our house and we just dedicated one to it.  So, if you want to just turn the ringer on, you can answer that whenever you want to.  If I want to, yeah.  But you usually just leave the ringer off.  Yeah, because the whole bit is, let's play.  Like, even now, people understand, like, yo, I'm going to leave a message on the voicemail 
[03:47:00]  and Nick's going to play it the next morning.  That's the bit.  The bit isn't like, really, oh, you can call me at home.  The bit is like, if you got some shit you want to say to me, call me and then that's  how we'll do it.  I got to appreciate your honesty in answering these questions because there is one more  bit and then we're going to stop analyzing your bits.  All right.  Best favorite breakfast cereal.  Oh, come on.  That was like the second day at work.  I didn't even know.  But, hey, it got the phones ringing.  It did.  That was a thing where people didn't even know I was there. 
[03:47:30]  And, you know, when you're starting, especially like the five or six o'clock hour, the phones  don't ring at all.  So, to get people going, it's like, yo, what's your favorite breakfast?  I didn't know that bit.  I was new to radio.  It was like the first week.  So, I get it now.  It wasn't, now that I'm like working on bits all day long and stuff, it's like, okay, now  let's figure it out.  We have a caller.  Uh-oh.  Line 12, you're on the air.  Hello, Nick.  This is the fugitive. 
[03:48:00]  Hilarious.  What's up, fugitive?  I have a question for you.  You must guess who I am.  I must guess who you are.  Okay, I will.  I'm mysterious.  I'm a rookie producer that smells like your wife's vagina.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This is it.  I mean, he says he wants to do a fugitive bit.  I'm with Amish Manola.  That's terrible.  You must smell beautiful then, Amish.  That's just awful. 
[03:48:30]  I mean, I can't believe this.  It's awful, but it's hilarious.  I'm physically embarrassed.  Yeah, because we're trying to clear the air a little bit here.  And, you know, I mean, this is a legendary thing because I know I, for one, I'm the person,  I'm a producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  I just host the after show.  Right.  And I listen to your show, like, a lot.  Well, thank you.  And that's one of my main jobs is to listen to your show and find, like.  To see, find the bits that you guys can make fun of.  And I have to sometimes, we'll sit through entire shows like, uh, got him. 
[03:49:00]  And then, like, there's one little thing that you'll say.  That's funny.  So, uh, I appreciate you being here.  And we should plug where you're here to promote, uh.  Yeah, I'm gonna be, um, I'm the grill master this 4th of July at, uh, Coney Island.  We're doing the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, so.  Oh, okay.  Is Pat involved with that this year?  Uh, I think he did qualify.  One of our guys, Pat from Munaki, competes, regularly loses.  He never even, uh, comes close to winning.  Yeah, because that's how I wanted to do it.  I wanted to be in it.  It was, I wanted, you know, it was a bit.  Right.  It was a radio program. 
[03:49:30]  I was like, yo, I should do it.  Last year I tried.  I only could eat four.  And we had it, so I was like, I gotta figure out how I can get there.  And they were like, won't you come down and host and cook the hot dogs?  How repulsive was Sandy Cain?  Yo!  They didn't even show the whole thing.  Like, she literally gave me a lap dance, jumped on me.  I was like, I gotta go get a hepatitis shot after this.  She's one of our regulars.  She was, uh, she's been on our show for years.  And then she walked out on me like she didn't want nothing to do with me.  Like, start cursing at me.  Because she thought she was really gonna win. 
[03:50:00]  Did she tell you about Twato?  She didn't.  She's got a growth on her vagina.  It's a genital word.  I've heard about this.  I did hear about this.  Yeah, she's awful.  We gotta wrap up because we gotta get you out of here.  I did want to ask one more question, though.  Yes.  Do you find it demeaning that you're a celebrity, you're a bona fide celebrity, no matter how much  anybody makes fun of you?  I don't think I'm a celebrity.  I work in the entertainment industry.  Uh, that you have to do these radio bits as any other jock does, even though you're like  a famous guy already.  It doesn't matter to me because I don't really, I don't carry myself like a famous dude. 
[03:50:30]  I'm just like, I actually enjoy it.  I have fun.  Like, it's fun, man.  Like, I mean, even generally, like, as doing stand-up on the road, like, there's, stand-up  is way more demeaning than radio.  Like, you just, sometimes you're on a stage, it's three people in the audience, it's three  in the morning, and you're just up there entertaining.  I love that.  So, anything above that, I'm like, yo, this is nothing.  You really don't, radio, you really don't feel the stares and the disinterest that you 
[03:51:00]  feel from a live audience.  Oh, yeah, somebody's, like, eating a burger in your face as you, like, entertain me.  Yeah.  We appreciate you being here, Nick.  It took balls.  Yeah, you're a nice guy, man.  Troy, you go ahead and host the show while Jim and me get pictures with Nick Camden.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's fine.  I need access to the, uh, hang on a second.  Yeah, take it.  You guys, it's good being here, man.  Pleasure, man.  Had to switch positions here.  All right, I'm going to take a couple calls, and then, uh, I'm going to  They're getting some, um, pictures, and then we've got to get to the bottom of what's  going on with Eric.  Follow me.  Because, uh, he definitely is a little upset. 
[03:51:30]  He's been a little weird all day, so, uh, all right, uh, let's talk to, uh, John in Cleveland.  That's a skateboarding question.  John.  Is this a shit show?  It certainly is.  All right, hey, is little Jimmy Robinson around?  I wanted to say hi to little Jimmy Robinson.  Uh, he's, little Jimmy's, uh, getting a photo here from.  All right, take care.  Thank you very much.  Yo.  What's up, man?  Thanks, man.  No doubt.  Thank you.  All right, well, thank you for the call. 
[03:52:00]  Hold on, I'm switching positions again.  Sam's going back.  That's what she said.  All right, um, that was cool.  It's not fun.  You look, uh, Nick is, I, I, a couple things.  That was cool.  You saw fun.  Very, very impressed with, very impressed with Sam.  Very ballsy.  Um, very good.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm, I'm a pussy.  Asking, asking the questions about his bitch, you mean?  Yeah, I mean, it was, uh, that was what needed to be done.  You were very good.  And, uh, Nick's a nice dude, man.  He was, uh, he, he's unflappable. 
[03:52:30]  And that's what you realize, like, cause he's, he's a fucking beautifully handsome guy.  It's almost depressing.  Did he see his ring?  I, I, dude, his fucking ring.  It's, what was that Richard Pryor movie?  Uh, I want to say it was which way is up with a giant ring was hanging out of the window.  That's what he was wearing on his finger.  And you understand how he landed Mariah Carey.  He smells rich.  Unflappable.  Even, even, uh, that horrible caller who really was great.  But you're not gonna, he's just unflappable.  It was, I mean, I was impressed that he came in here. 
[03:53:00]  And he wasn't, like, defensive the way people are when they come in here.  He answered every question.  You know, I know what it is.  You threw the cereal bit at him.  I was glad that you asked about Sandy Cain, too.  Yeah, but the only question I had the balls to ask is there was no risk in it.  You were very good.  I was very impressed with Sandy.  Well, you were sitting next to him.  I got the whole table.  It doesn't matter.  I still would have done the same thing if I was over there.  I just would have given him a fluff interview.  I really would have.  Just, what if he says no to the picture after this?  I can't give him a bad interview.  I'm a true, a truly a worm.  I'm doing the SPS for the Tonight Show, and I'm just all, I just, I can't obsess over pictures. 
[03:53:30]  I can't.  This is what a worm you are.  Are you Aaron Rodgers this time?  I got him.  All I want is Ali if he's there.  You're an even bigger worm because if I had done the fluff interview, you would have done  a fluff interview.  Without a doubt.  If I had done one and then brought it to the air, when we got back from vacation, you would  have destroyed me.  Slaughtered you.  I would have slaughtered you.  It's called being a phony.  Please get Alexander Veshkins.  No, I don't know who that is.  The best hockey player out there. 
[03:54:00]  I don't fuck him.  It's a stupid Soviet name.  All I want is Ali.  He'll come back with a picture.  Yes, I will.  We got Ant back.  Ant back?  That was Ant before?  That was Ant on the hotline.  Hello.  Oh my God.  I was in the fucking tunnel.  I didn't get to hear what happened after I hung out.  He laughed.  He did.  He said...  Oh, did he?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's cool.  He said that must mean you smell terrific or something.  Jim and me did the whole, like, I can't believe that people would just call up like  that, and Nick said it was funny, and then he said that, then that guy must smell delicious 
[03:54:30]  or something like that.  He's a nice guy.  He's a fucking very cool dude.  It's like it's...  Oh, so you stayed on the fucking rodeo again.  I did it, baby.  I love the rodeo, because I didn't hang up on you either.  Your phone cut off before I hung up on you.  Oh, I know.  I went into the tunnel, but I heard you asking, or, you know, commenting on his bits and stuff,  and that was pretty good.  Yeah, man, I mean, if he's going to be in here...  Let's get to your shit bits.  The first was this one. 
[03:55:00]  We have five minutes, dude.  It was like...  Yeah, Sam was very good.  He asked all the questions that you should have asked.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  You get a good picture with him and stuff?  We had to, just for the show, of course.  Did he smell all rich and everything?  Dude, he had your Escalade on his finger.  Fucking guy is a multimillionaire, yeah.  God damn.  Yeah, he's banging Mariah Carey, lots of money.  He's doing the Nathan's hot dog thing, so he's promoting that.  The hot dog eating contest.  Yes.  He's the grill master. 
[03:55:30]  He's the grill master?  Yes, sir.  It's a radio promotion bit.  Exactly.  He's going to be meeting the likes of a Pat from Munaki?  Yeah.  Wow.  Nick Cannon.  Good thing it's not Nick Handgun.  How you doing?  Have him removed.  Okay.  Yeah, like his toe.  All right.  All right, have a good trip, Jimmy, and good shows there.  Thank you, brother.  Where are you going to be?  Where is that?  Washington?  I'll be in Seattle tomorrow night, and then Sunday, Vegas. 
[03:56:00]  I was waiting to get yelled at.  Vegas, and then are you coming to my house on the 4th?  Yeah.  Because I'm going to party on the 3rd, but then you're going to come over on the 4th,  and we're going to hang out.  Yeah, I fly home the morning of the 4th.  You're going to miss the party.  I will, but I will.  It'll still be gone.  It'll still be going into the 4th.  Yeah.  None of you worry.  I'll be in Vegas laughing, chilling, smiling, dancing.  You know.  Oh, the dancers will kick your teeth out.  Yeah.  But throughout chips, everybody plays that in the house. 
[03:56:30]  What's that?  Oh, I got to go.  I got a plane to catch.  All right, sweetie.  But safe flight.  Thank you, sweetie.  Have fun.  All right.  I'll see you.  I'll see you.  I'll see you fucking on the 4th.  Yeah.  Unless I'm killed.  Hey, all right.  No.  You didn't pray to God.  I dared him.  He did dare God.  Oh, God.  Are you taking them from JFK?  No, I know there's turtles.  Turtles on the runway.  Yeah, that's like crazy.  That's like the little game you play when you take your little fingers  and you crawl over the little stomach and testicles. 
[03:57:00]  You go, look.  Look, turtles are coming.  Look, the turtle's got your little peepee.  He's kissing it.  You know, I remember when Paul used to be at least a little subtle.  Yeah.  Now he's just talking about taking youngsters' dicks in his mouth.  Yeah.  You know, you pull the diaper off and you grab the little bag and you go,  look at the turtle shell, and you kiss the turtle's head poking out.  You are fucked.  Look, I want to make the turtle head stick out fodder. 
[03:57:30]  They know what they're doing.  If God wasn't going to crash your plane, he is now, my friend.  Yeah.  All right, have fun, kids.  Bye.  Bye, Uncle Anthony.  And I'll be in traffic for the next hour and a half.  All right, continue with the shit show.  All right.  Well done.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I feel bad.  I've taken the show from Troy.  It's fine by me.  You do a better job at it than I did.  Thanks for throwing me into the bus yesterday.  Well, you should have booked Nick Cannon yesterday. 
[03:58:00]  I would have taken it from you.  He wasn't here yesterday.  Bye, guys.  I'll see you.  Good job, man.  Travel safely, Jim.  I'll see you guys Sunday, maybe.  Monday.  Tuesday.  Wednesday.  No, I'm at Anthony's.  So I was going to Anthony's.  Go to Anthony's on fucking the fourth.  What are you doing?  Party's on the third.  I'm too many.  Troy, I'm going to give you the reins again.  Should we reset?  Should we need to take a break, Eric?  Or we should play?  No, we don't need to take a break.  Why don't we play a little bit of Blake Shelton that he reset?  No breaks.  What we'll do. 
[03:58:30]  Why don't you talk about Ant's big party?  I mean, does he want me talking about it on the air?  I asked him if I could talk about it, and he said it was fine.  He's having a party, and I was invited, and I'm excited about that.  First compound party.  I don't know what you're choosing to be the biggest party.  You know what the key is to this show?  I'll give you a hint, and I didn't give it to Mars.  He did fine.  Well, I could have given it to Roland, and he still would have failed.  What did you say?  You still would have failed.  What did you say? 
[03:59:00]  You still.  Yeah.  Interaction with these guys, not the phones.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, when the phones are lit up and they want to blast me for stuff, I want to  hear what they have to say.  They'll be lit up every day.  But I want to hear what they have to say.  They'll blast you for anything.  But I really wanted to get to...  Is Eric in there?  Where did he go?  I'm here.  Hey, get on...  Get on mic.  Yeah.  So, what's going on, dude?  You seem bummed out.  Is the buzzer thing...  Does that get you bummed out?  Yeah, that's a...  I'm gonna buy you lunch.  That's a bit much.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, then get here on time. 
[03:59:30]  And it wouldn't be...  I mean, if the buzzer's going off at 5 a.m., it's not that big of a deal, right?  Well, you mind your business.  Hey.  I'm not the one that decided to do that.  No, it's okay.  You can be a rat.  That's fine.  Be a rat?  Oh, shit.  So, when I'm...  Smell it like cheese.  When your boss asks you to do something, then you're gonna do it, right?  So, am I supposed to say no?  No, you definitely should do it.  Okay.  So, what's the problem?  It still makes you a rat, but it's...  Oh, shit.  For seeing when you walk in the door and playing something, as I've been told? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  That makes me a rat?  A little bit.  Why don't you do your job and get here on time?  Because I don't need to.  Don't you?  Because you're the big boss, right?  Huh?  You're a big boss man, right?  No, I'm not a big boss man.  Okay, so then why can't you get here when everybody else gets here?  Because I don't have to do what everybody else does.  Otherwise, I don't need to be here.  So, when your bosses tell you to get here on time, you're saying...  You're gonna be defiant and say, no, I don't have to.  I'm not being defiant.  Well, yes, you are.  Because, look, I don't have to do that.  So, when your bosses say to you...  This really bothers you. 
[04:00:30]  No, it's just because you don't have a valid argument.  You're calling me...  Why am I answering this to you?  Well, because you're calling me a rat, and I'm wondering why I'm a rat.  I love you, Troy.  Do you?  No.  Oh.  That's the worst.  I mean, do your fucking job, dude.  Get here when you're supposed to get here.  My job gets done.  All right.  Well, when your bosses tell you to get here at a certain time, and you don't get here  at that time, that's being defiant.  Que sera, sera.  So.  Que sera, sera, he says.  Whatever. 
[04:01:00]  Now I'm really excited to set off that buzzer next time.  And I'm gonna really be monitoring.  Oh, wow.  He's looking after you, dude.  He's doing his job.  Good for him.  Why is it...  What's your problem today, dude?  I don't have a fucking problem with you.  You're the one who keeps...  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  Well, because you were grouchy the entire show, and Opie had said to get to figure out  what's going on.  Yeah.  So, I'm asking you what's going on.  And I didn't have to answer to you for that.  So, he doesn't have a problem with you.  He has a problem with somebody. 
[04:01:30]  Who is it?  Well, who do you have the problem with?  I have no problem with anybody.  It's Sam.  Well, he's a piece of shit, too, but...  Oh, shit.  Why is he a piece of shit?  Wow.  Because he's a piece of shit.  Why?  Semi-show.  He's for setting up the Twitter thing.  So, why don't you set him up?  Why don't you set him up?  Because I don't want to spend my day monitoring him.  Shut the fuck up.  You shut the fuck up.  Oh, there was some real venom there.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  What's going on? 
[04:02:00]  You're mad at him for setting up that Twitter account.  I think it's unnecessary.  I think the picture was wrong.  But...  Oh, that's why you laughed at it.  It wasn't my fault.  So, your neck was choking you from laughing.  Oh, shit.  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.  But in Sam's defense,  if I'm going to defend Sam here for a second...  Uh-huh.  There are people that aren't able to listen at 5 a.m.  that want to know when you're coming in.  They want to play along at home.  Oh, that's not my fucking problem they don't listen at that time.  So, don't be mad at him for setting up the Twitter account. 
[04:02:30]  Now, there's people that want to play along at home.  There's people that want to listen to the show that don't pay for it either.  Should we help them out?  Well, hey, they're just trying to play along at home.  You can't be mad at them for that.  And Sam is just trying to help out the listeners.  Well, I mean, maybe the picture was a little overdone.  You could have picked a little bit more of a flattering picture.  I do apologize for that for the picture.  I didn't set the Twitter up.  Sorry.  No.  Well, whoever set it up, they're just trying to play along.  Any one of these people here set it up.  All right.  Well, that got nowhere.  Eric's in a bad mood. 
[04:03:00]  You're just stressed out because of all the work that has to get done for the holiday.  Well, Eric does do a lot of the worst stuff, though.  He does.  Look, Eric.  Because we're doing a lot of vacation time.  Yes.  In Eric's defense, he does do a lot.  All the shows that you hear this weekend, he has to put together.  He has to load.  Well, I know it's his job.  No, but still, though, it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work on his shoulders.  Everybody's coming back on Tuesday.  We're not coming back until Thursday, so that's double his work.  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  So he could do it on Tuesday.  No, but it's a lot of work, though.  He has other stuff to do.  Well, he has to get everything from tomorrow through Tuesday finished by today before he  walks out of here.  Does he get paid?  He gets paid.  But he should get paid more, as everybody should.  I don't know about that.  That's what I say.  I mean, I don't know.  All right.  I'm going to buy him lunch.  Let's see here.  Should we go to the calls?  All right.  We're going to go to Bill in Georgia.  Go ahead, Bill.  Hey, Troy.  Yo.  You said that the guys that can't listen at 5 a.m. won't know when he comes in. 
[04:04:00]  They don't have to start listening until about a quarter to six.  I mean, Bill does raise a valid point here.  But what I'm saying is there's a lot of people that listen to the replays.  You know, they don't know.  So when they wake up and they want to see the Twitter, oh, Eric came in at this time  today.  So, you know, I get the reason for the Twitter.  Should we do more?  I don't know.  What do you what do you think?  Let's go to let's do John in New York.  Number nine.  No.  Oh, there's two John in New York.  You see what I'm saying? 
[04:04:30]  All right.  Other John in New York.  We're going to get to you.  John in New York from 202.  What's up, dude?  What's going on?  What do you got, man?  You rock.  How long do you think it's going to take you before you get fired?  Not soon enough.  I don't think Eric's going to get fired.  I don't think Eric's going to.  He's been with this.  He's been loyal to the show for a long time.  You don't think he's going to go anywhere.  John in New York.  Yes, Troy.  Since you're a DJ, I have a pertinent DJ-related question for you.  Yes.  Would you rather suck Fatboy Slim's cock or get DP'd by Chemical Brothers? 
[04:05:00]  I probably have to say I'd rather suck Fatboy Slim's cock than get DP'd, although the Chemical  Brothers are good.  But Fatboy, he's actually playing this Saturday here in the city.  He did the show before, too.  What's that?  He did the show.  Troy.  What are we doing?  You got to move.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, man.  Whoa! 
[04:05:30]  Whoa!  I'd be in the house.  I just want to say, Troy, Iraq, don't you see that Sam's behind all of this?  The puppet master.  Stop.  Yes, he is.  He's the pubic master.  But you just have to know when dealing with him that this is what he does, and this is  why he's funny on the show, that he stirs shit up.  Wait.  Who's funny?  Sam?  Yeah.  All right. 
[04:06:00]  You know, I was just in a conversation with little Jimmy downstairs, who was telling me  what Sam was up to, and also he said that you were being very ballsy with Nick Cannon.  Mm-hmm.  What exactly did you say to Nick Cannon that was so ballsy?  You're shit bits.  No, I didn't say you're shit.  Hey, Nick Cannon, you're shit bits.  Mm-hmm.  Nick Cannon came in here, and, I mean, Opie and Anthony have had a history with him.  Exactly.  So, I said, this is the one chance we got.  We got five minutes, and I just started asking him questions about the bits that we've made 
[04:06:30]  fun of.  So, uh, I'm dying to hear this.  I said, uh...  It was nice and tense.  I mean, a little, but he handled it well.  He wasn't defensive.  I saw Nick down in the lobby, and he was posing with some people of color.  People of color are very, very excited to see Nick Cannon in our lobby.  I asked him, uh, what he thought when, uh, 92.3 Now came at him with the fugitive idea.  Uh-huh.  I asked him, uh, if our fans talk to him a lot on Twitter, which they do. 
[04:07:00]  How did he roll with it?  He was fine.  He was cool about everything.  I asked him, uh, about his fake voicemail he set up.  Was he in LA last night?  I guess he must have been.  No, no, no, no, no, because...  No, no, no, no, that's the auditions.  That's not a live show.  Okay.  Um...  I can't keep it up.  I can't keep up.  I asked him about doing, uh, what's your favorite cereal bit?  Because that's one we highlighted on the show, too.  Now, Troy, what's up with you and E-Rock?  I thought you guys were...  By the way, you...  You fucking proved today that the wheel really does...  I mean, it brings out the best in people. 
[04:07:30]  Roland, of course, you proved that yesterday.  But the, uh...  What's going on with you and E-Rock?  I thought you guys were like brothers.  We are.  I mean, we're good friends.  I...  He's just...  He's been in a bit of a funk today, especially.  But I understand why.  I mean, he gets lambasted on the show, but he sets himself up to get lambasted.  And he doesn't want to do anything to correct that.  So...  What would you like to...  What would you like him to do?  You know, when he...  He needs to get here at a certain time.  Get here at that time.  You know, if he's challenged to do something, step up and do it. 
[04:08:00]  You know what I mean?  And so it's just this constant, vicious cycle of him...  You honestly don't see him as the soul of the show.  I mean, you know...  He does a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.  But even beyond that, that stuff that...  All the stuff that you complain about is kind of good for O&A.  It kind of fits their personality.  And one thing E-Rock does is put the show first.  But it's the show first.  But I don't know if he's happy doing that.  I think there's a lot of...  But that's from the trooper.  Resentment. 
[04:08:30]  There's a lot of resentment inside that he's holding and that he won't let out.  And he won't really tell everybody what he really feels he holds it inside.  E-Rock, is this true?  Well, I don't know why Troy feels the need for me to confide in him.  Either on-air or off-air about what's going on inside of me.  Whether there is something going on inside of me or not.  And he's constantly like, what's wrong with you?  Why aren't you getting in...  You're more concerned about me than I'm concerned about me or about what you're doing.  But you know who says that?  Addicts.  Addicts say the same thing. 
[04:09:00]  And Troy is a mental health official.  He's got a background in it.  He's done very, very well over the years.  And he sees something in his friend.  E-Rock, is there something you're not telling us?  I wish I knew.  Well, is your marriage breaking up?  No, not at all.  Shit.  Not yet.  Shit.  He said shit.  He wanted it to break up.  Because he wanted show fodder.  It's not my show.  I didn't mean to say anything.  I mean, I like Eric as a person.  I really do.  And I want to see him...  He is a person.  I think he pushes... 
[04:09:30]  Yeah, he is.  He pushes a lot of things down.  I don't care, guys.  I really don't, you know.  That's good.  Seriously.  Work that character.  And bring that back next time you're on the wheel.  Yeah.  E-Rock, do you think Troy really does care about you?  Yeah, I think he does.  But I think he does also take it a little farther than it needs to go.  Like, it's almost...  Like, the way he would act is sometimes like...  You know, my wife should act like that. 
[04:10:00]  Or family members should act like that.  But he acts like that.  And that's a big...  So you feel like your wife...  That's a little confusing.  Right.  But you feel like your wife and family members are letting you down a little bit?  Seriously, for not having the same interest in you that Troy does?  No, they have interest in me.  Just not to the level that Troy takes it.  But they think that you're unhappy, too?  No.  Is Troy being disingenuous?  No, I don't think he's being disingenuous.  I just think Troy is just trying to find something to go with.  Well, Troy did tell me how sexy he looked that one day. 
[04:10:30]  Well, that was nice.  See, here's the thing, Iraq.  And I think this is where he's coming from.  You see the wackness and everything, but Troy sees the dopeness and everything.  And that's what it's about right now.  Why can't you find the dopeness?  Why are you spending so much time with the wackness?  I don't know.  I didn't realize that this was an issue.  It's an issue, isn't it, Troy?  You don't see the best in your friend.  I just...  I want to see him be the best he can be.  Skateboarding.  Army? 
[04:11:00]  I mean, look, he obviously, he eats a lot.  He hides a lot of comfort in food.  Yeah, Troy's really obsessed with my diet.  Because you're going to run into a lot of problems, Eric.  You're going to.  We're fine.  We're fine.  No, don't bullshit yourself at it.  Keep telling yourself that.  What?  Here's the thing, though.  This is not a fine thing.  I worry that he's going to leave here and eat three chickens today, Troy.  I really am.  Barbecue?  Yeah, barbecue.  It does sound delicious.  Yeah, sometime a year.  Some corn, some sides.  Yes, it's summer. 
[04:11:30]  There's barbecue at Fox right on the corner there.  We'll go down to that.  I don't know.  I just want to see him, you know, like I said, do the best he can.  And I think he is holding in.  I know he's holding in a lot of hurt, resentment towards a lot of people.  He's counseling him.  Who do you think hurt him?  I think he's just been so beaten down by the show.  I think that has a lot to do with it.  I know who hurt him.  Who's that?  That shitheader just opened his mouth over there. 
[04:12:00]  I didn't hurt you, Eric.  You don't care enough about me.  I told you that she does.  He cares.  You think that I could actually hurt him, though?  No.  You hurt a lot?  I think the guy that hurt Eric was the guy who was once listed as one of Eric's heroes  on MySpace.  Hulk Hogan?  Opie.  Nah.  I think Opie hurt Eric.  Again, look how Sam wants to put the focus for people to feel negative about Opie.  This is one of the things that you do.  I'm not saying it's a legitimate feeling, that he should be hurt.  Sometimes people write to me, and they're like, you know, Sam's right about Opie, and 
[04:12:30]  I just write back down, Sam fucking being Sam.  I don't say negative things about Opie.  I'm running feathers in AOL, by the way.  I still rock the old AOL, and now that fucking JT is there, I'm going back to MySpace.  And when I'm going back, I'm going back for the first time.  Because I've never been there.  What is that?  It's televisions.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry.  It's just a TV.  Nothing's going to hurt you here, Troy.  You're with friends.  Yeah, I mean, you very well may be correct in saying that.  And I think with Sam, I don't think there's real venom behind what he does. 
[04:13:00]  I really don't.  I mean, he goofs on everybody.  Everybody takes their lumps from Sam.  And Eric can fight back.  He can fuck with Sam.  I mean, Sam can take it.  Sam has been fucked with, too, and everybody's seen it, and he handles his shit.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, fuck with him back.  You know, when he does something fucked up, fuck with him back.  But Eric just takes it.  And he doesn't fight back.  And I think holding all that inside really fucks with him.  Is this lighting you up now, Iraq?  Do you want a hug or something here? 
[04:13:30]  It seems like that.  I don't need a hug.  I just want...  He wants the best out of you.  I think so.  Eric's a cool dude.  I like Eric a lot.  But I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.  Are we breaking up?  No, he can't because we need a ride on Sam.  What would you like Iraq to do?  I'd like him to face some of the inner demons that I think are really bothering him and get to the bottom of some things.  And I would really like to see him stand up for himself when it comes up on the air and fight back and push back. 
[04:14:00]  And like that one day showed, when he fought back, people stood down and were like, all right, look.  You know, he's standing up for himself as opposed to just opening up his anus and taking it.  You know what I mean?  I didn't know he was doing that.  That's disgusting.  I think that's a bit much.  That's passive.  That's called Dick in the Ass.  Let me give you the Earl Douglas solution.  He would break a microphone and run down the stairs.  Never would he take the elevator when he was upset.  He always ran down the stairs.  He didn't chase him in a subway one day.  Yes. 
[04:14:30]  And it was very effective.  It was very effective.  He's a guy alone.  He's a maniac.  Yeah.  Or he fainted.  Well, he did faint a few times, but that was from Febreze.  And getting knocked out.  He got knocked the fuck out.  It happens.  And he knocked him on his ass.  Yes.  Let it be.  Yeah.  Joe Frazier's been knocked out.  I don't think that takes away anything from him.  Am I done?  Can I call it a day here?  I mean, you did a great job, though, Troy.  A lot of people are tied.  I think you saved the wheel.  I honestly think you and Nick Cannon together saved the wheel. 
[04:15:00]  And I noticed this.  Jimmy's hanging around for Troy.  Didn't hang around for Sam.  I think there might have been something to do with a photo opportunity with Nick Cannon.  Well, who wouldn't want that?  Who wouldn't want the photo opportunity of somebody who would tackle the air?  Of course.  Who would you want to get that picture taken?  The best part about it was Jim saying, like, he was surprised that I asked him questions  that pertain to how we talk about Nick Cannon on the air.  Because he said, if I were, I would have just done a fluff interview on it. 
[04:15:30]  Just fluffed it up a little bit?  And I just, you know, talked to him for five minutes so that I could get my picture after.  The other day, we had a Rappaport picture that Jim wanted signed.  And then Fez, he came to me and was like this.  God damn it, he didn't sign it, Jimmy.  He just signed his name.  And I go, what?  Well, he's specific.  And I mean, did he give you like an ink color?  No, I wasn't there for any of that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I went over it with Fez.  Good.  And Fez got it wrong?  No, Fez did everything right. 
[04:16:00]  Michael Rappaport just didn't sign to Jimmy.  That was all.  And Jim didn't care.  He was fine with it.  Michael Rappaport lives in his own fucking world.  Does he?  Yeah.  He's all over the fucking place.  I've always loved him in the movie.  I've never, you know, met him in person.  No, he's a fucking great dude.  But, like, the ADD thing is just gigantic.  Just in his own universe.  And by the way, he made a fucking, I don't know how you guys,  feel about Tribe Called Quest.  But it's a fucking terrific documentary you made.  Well, I know Rob was disappointed that it was Michael Rappaport,  not Q-Tip, in here. 
[04:16:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  He's like, yeah, you're like, yeah, I got Michael Rappaport in here.  And Cross was like, shit.  I thought you had Q-Tip.  No, you got a phone.  Pick it up.  Call Q-Tip.  You're a fucking PD here.  Book him yourself.  Yeah.  I'm sure you'd love to talk to Q-Tip.  You want to let Ron and Fez have their time?  Well, do you have a co-host we should promote?  Yeah, I think it's Hank Reynolds, newsman.  And yesterday it turned out to be, I don't know, Barry Champlain.  It wasn't bad, Barry.  No, Barry was fantastic.  Yeah, he wasn't bad at all.  He's finding himself in the upper tier, what's going on lately. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  Hank Reynolds does straight news, though.  So we're going to be getting a lot of news.  Finally something for you to comment on, though.  Yeah.  I love Yahoo News.  I love to know what's going on out there in the world.  I already brought up JT's story.  He's taking over MySpace.  Stop stealing his material, would you?  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Come on, dude.  All this belongs to him.  I also want to say that there's trouble in the Middle East.  No.  Troy, end your show.  All right.  Thank you, everybody, for listening.  Primetime Sam Roberts will be back on Thursday when the show's back.  And Monday, whatever, whenever the show's back. 
[04:17:30]  We're ending the wheel.  The wheel's done.  The wheel's running its course.  What was a hell of a great week?  It was a memorable week.  I mean, it was great.  Clips every day.  Yeah.  Well, can I just say, this is going to be great to have you back, Sammy.  Everybody's missed you.  Thank you so much, Ron.  Yeah.  I can't wait to come back.  All right.  Sign off.  Thank you.  Ron and Fez, next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:18:00]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus.  Yes.  God bless it.  Holy.  Holy.  hace ya to Hoopa.  White city.  fools. 很好.  Yes.  with all the people.  disciplines.  The brain.
