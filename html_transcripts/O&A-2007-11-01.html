<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Halloween anecdotes. Anthony described his elaborate scheme to avoid trick-or-treaters, involving hiding in his garage, a “crime scene” sign, security cameras, and Paltalk interaction with online viewers. Opie recounted his Halloween experience in a high-rise building plagued by elevator-hogging children.  This segued into a discussion of news stories involving stabbings and shootings, the challenges faced by police, and a caller’s complaint about restrictive school Halloween costume policies.  The conversation then veered into the sexualization of children's costumes, fueled by listener comments and photos, leading to a debate about judging individuals based on their online behavior.  Further calls highlighted perceived over-regulation of Halloween in schools. A caller introduced "Povember," prompting a revisit of the controversial "E-Rocktober" event, including audio clips of E-Rock spanking a female guest, Justine Jolie, on air.

Dane Cook joined the show to promote his stand-up, CDs, and World Series commercials. He shared anecdotes, including his father's reaction to the Red Sox win. Penn Jillette also appeared, contributing to humorous discussions about their fathers' emotional responses and his experiences with other radio hosts who falsely claimed Teller was with him.  This segment also included a discussion of Bill Donahue's attempts to get the show canceled and their evolving relationship with him,  a detailed analysis of a heavily-bleeped voicemail from Dog the Bounty Hunter containing racial slurs directed at his son,  and A&E's subsequent suspension of Dog’s show. Bob Kelly was also a guest in studio during this part of the show.  The "E-Rocktober" incident was revisited, with further discussion of the physical altercation between E-Rock and Justine Jolie.

A subsequent chaotic segment focused on an on-air confrontation between E-Roc, his girlfriend (who called in), and a naked stripper in the studio.  This led to an emotionally charged phone conversation, E-Roc leaving the studio in distress, and discussions of Bob Kelly’s online wedding video and reaction to the "Two Girls, One Cup" video. Dane Cook briefly participated, and Slash was in studio for the XM portion of the broadcast.  The latter part of the segment involved a discussion of Slash's autobiography, his career with Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, his drug use, and his musical influences.  Numerous off-color jokes and comments about sex, strippers, and violence were interspersed throughout this segment.

The final segment featured Slash as a guest, covering topics ranging from comedians’ reactions to other comedians “bombing,”  Slash’s barring from a Guns N’ Roses show in Vegas (due to Axl Rose’s concerns), the quick creation of classic Guns N’ Roses songs, his near-miss joining Poison, the 80s glam metal scene, his musical influences (including a fondness for The Cars), and anecdotes from his autobiography.  A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Danny, a show employee, nervously and repeatedly failing to play Guitar Hero 3 in front of Slash.  The hosts also discussed other guests and their interactions, interspersed with listener-submitted lines of the day and interruptions from show members, before concluding the broadcast. Throughout the entire broadcast,  numerous racial slurs and other offensive language were used by the hosts, guests and callers.

[00:03:00]  this holiday's gotta end  whatever it is  I don't even consider it a holiday  because no one's really off  from work or anything  why does it have to end?  uh  because it's  it's really annoying  it's intrusive  uh  it doesn't have a  a real like  purpose  halloween  it's just stupid  I swear to god  I was  I was zoned out for a second reading this church article  I think you meant  the playing of Roland C  in the national anthem  oh 
[00:03:30]  well  that too  yes that too  let's just stop democracy  we hate it  yeah  uh that could only mean one thing  you had some trick-or-treaters yesterday  ah  a few  a few  and they annoyed the hell out of you  what's going on with you?  it just  the second  I pull into my garage  um  and then of course shut the door quickly  uh  they  they came out of everywhere 
[00:04:00]  in my neighborhood  see I wasn't around for last Halloween  uh  but I'm around for this one  and all I saw were  droves  of children  in costumes  all over the neighborhood  and I'm like  as I'm pulling into my neighborhood  I'm like uh oh  this is trouble  I don't have any candy  I just  I  what do you mean you don't have any candy?  well  you were talking about getting candy  in the big Snickers bars  and being  the cool house 
[00:04:30]  here's the deal  I uh  I get home  and then I have to take a little nap  uh  and then I go to the gym  and then by the time I get back from the gym  like it's  it's already  I don't know  it's after five  I know that's kind of peak  Halloween-y time  but  I wasn't thinking about candy  or anything  so who was at the house  listening to the doorbell  just ring over and over again  poor little Jack Jack  poor Jack Jack  was just 
[00:05:00]  petrified  because he doesn't like the bell anyway  the bell scares him  he runs upstairs  and hides behind a big mirror  he just gets scared  he's scared because he thinks his owner's coming home  no  I'm very good to Jack Jack  I hope you are  yes  and uh  so I pull in the garage  and droves the kids like  come to the house  but now I don't have anything  so I'm  I didn't want to go into the house  because I got too many windows  and they could see me 
[00:05:30]  so there I am in my dark garage  which uh  my garage door has little glass at the top of the door  so I'm standing up on my uh  my Escalade bumper  peering out  peering out  peering out with one eye  at the little children in their costumes  and  and just hoping they go away  I felt like Anne Frank  I was just hiding  and then  they start taking pictures in front of my house  they're like  they're like taking pictures in front of my house 
[00:06:00]  that means you have  you have a nice house  no I guess they're on to me  let's take a picture in front of the shock jocks house  oh really  yeah  did you have Halloween decorations out  not a one  not a one  and uh  so  so I'm kinda  I figure alright  they go away  I go in the house  and then I sit at the computer for a little bit  but I notice the computer  there's a line of sight there  through uh  one of the windows  in the front of the house 
[00:06:30]  so uh  I hear  I hear  and I just run  and I find myself  I go I'm hiding in my house  so I had to go out  and buy candy  so I figured  I'd go out  and buy some candy  so I did that  came back  with just a crap load of candy  and uh  believe me  it's hard to find on Halloween afternoon  cause the place is ravaged  and  but I get  I get like good stuff  for the little tots  and I put in a big thing  by the door 
[00:07:00]  and  but I also  took uh  my laptop  put it at the top of the stairs  with a camera  and uh  put it on pal talk  so I figured that  if I'm gonna hang around  and be on pal talk  on uh  the computer  I have another camera  that shows the front door  so the people can see  the little tots  and uh  they were making jokes  because every time  somebody came to the door  they would know  before I did  cause they'd see him  peering through my windows  and go uh  Anthony you're being invaded  now 
[00:07:30]  many racial epithets  being thrown out  I think the dog  uh  was uh  on pal talk  the dog  dog the bounty hunter  dog the bounty hunter  that's the reason  you're listening to this show today  we'll get to that a little bit  go ahead  and uh  I went to the door a couple of times  and handed out some candy  but for the most part  the second I bought that candy  uh  it pretty much ended  they weren't coming to the door anymore  so now you're stuck with a lot of candy  so now I'm stuck with a lot of candy  and I didn't wanna  I didn't wanna wait around  and if I went up to bed 
[00:08:00]  and someone starts knocking on the door  I was  I'd be uh  you know annoyed  so I remembered  in my truck  uh  an officer friend of mine  had to write a note  on uh  on something  and put it in my windshield  one day  just so I could park  for a few minutes somewhere  so the note was written  on the back  of a great  big  place card  that said  uh  crime scene  under investigation  do not cross police line 
[00:08:30]  and I stapled that to my front door  and uh  that pretty much ended  ended  halloween at my house  right there  right there  big yellow sign  that a crime scene  was behind that door  and  not to even interrupt  it's being investigated  that's  it worked perfectly  that's wonderful  that is wonderful  I uh  I learned something  I live in a  big building now  and I live pretty high up 
[00:09:00]  yeah  these little effers  you know  I like kids  these little effers  take up the elevators  oh really  and I  and I feel  sorry for these city kids  what they do is  they just go from floor to floor  and and the big buildings  they trick or treat  uh  how boring is that  vertically  vertically  vertically  but  they take up the elevators  for the whole day  oh yeah  and everyone warns you in the lobby  like oh you're gonna try to use the elevator  good luck  I'm like but I live like way up  you know way up high  well you might as well start walking now 
[00:09:30]  really  and I didn't believe them  so I started uh  hitting the elevator button  and you could hear the little effers  with their parents  holding the elevator door  as they're going from floor  to floor  to floor  to floor  to floor  because they don't want to  they don't want to wait for the elevator  so if they got one  they pile everybody in  and they just go from floor to floor  you know doing their trick or treating  and then I'm  I was wondering why  no one was coming to our door  and I realized that  we were supposed to sign up I guess  or something  I don't know  because these uh 
[00:10:00]  are you kidding me  they have like a list  walking around with a list  of what apartments were cool  which ones to go to  I didn't know  which ones have the red dot  next to it  yeah  which ones are on that website  that the parents checked first  says Uncle Paul  speaking of which  CokeLogic has a new creation  oh really  yeah trick or treaters go into  Uncle Paul's uh house  it's an animation  I don't know where it's gonna be  it'll be on  sure some of the fan sites  that's for sure  good evening 
[00:10:30]  trick or treat  good evening  my health doesn't allow it  oh  yeah  this candy uh  food  alright  no  try the wine  but I'm eight  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine  but  my sister was here earlier  what happened to her  she was very badly raped  you see  victim of the modern age 
[00:11:00]  poor poor girl  I'd love to go to his house  on Halloween  I don't want to talk to him  on the phone for hours  about anything  and then Kenny made an observation  that a lot of the  yeah  a lot of the people were still  dressing their costumes  on the way in today  all drunk just you know  doing the uh  the wobbly walk  really  yeah all over the sidewalks  of New York City  oh cause it is still  kind of just morning  or late night actually  when we uh  by the time  candy you know  makes it into Manhattan  yeah it's it's it's for something 
[00:11:30]  so  the streets were a  vomitorium  absolutely  yeah  and nothing but uh  hot Halloween outfits  once again this year  oh did you go down to the uh  gay parade  so uh  we  another um  showcase of  flamboyant gay people  flamboyant gay people  just annoying the hell  out of uh  gay people that just wanna  kinda live their lives  as  you know  kinda uh  normal  straight ahead  well not straight  but you know 
[00:12:00]  go to work everyday  just trying to earn a living  what  not really being flamboyant  with their gayness  were there any uh  problems down there  uh  I heard uh  what on the news on the way in  a couple stabbings and stuff  that was in Union Square  Union Square  with a flesh knife  repeatedly  repeatedly  and they say  is it a victim  if he continually backed into the offending weapon  apparently was stabbed in the larynx as well  stabbed in the tonsils 
[00:12:30]  the face  his spine  his little backside  it only ended when the weapon lost its rigidity  he had a knife in each hand  one black one white  laughing  laughing  having a knife slapped in his face  laughing  laughing  laughing  laughing  laughing  yeah I don't know  I guess compared to the amount of people down there  uh not much trouble but  there was a shooting somewhere in New York last night  of course 
[00:13:00]  I think Union Square area  not really  Philly uh  their shootings always  Philadelphia man  ah a couple of cops  yeah  in one day  a cop got shot in the head  uh  what trying to break up a robbery at a Dunkin Donuts  or something  yeah  was it a Dunkin Donuts  it's some convenience store  or was it a Dunkin Donuts  I'm not sure  but then uh  the news said that uh  it's the third police shooting  the third cop this week  that got shot this week  I know  in Philly  just open season  yeah they don't know what to do down there  in some of those neighborhoods  they're uh 
[00:13:30]  they're like encouraging like  just regular citizens to kinda  to help out  that's how desperate they are  a couple of cop friends were over the house yesterday  and one of them's from Philly  and uh  he was saying  you know  it's  it's ridiculous  there's nothing  I was telling him  like  it's  it's a losing battle  cause  people scream that they need more police presence  in an area  and then you give them the police presence  and they say that there's police brutality going on  so they want them out of the neighborhood  and then the cops try to do their job 
[00:14:00]  and they wind up  with a good possibility of going to jail  uh  no matter what they do  to try to uh  uh  get rid of some of the crime that's going on  so it's a losing proposition  I don't know  uh  whoever wants to be a cop these days  man  I don't know  you know  we have this job where  alright  if we screw up  we get fired  maybe uh  a couple people uh  like Jimmy  get arrested for a day  a day and a half  two days  uh  I'm not putting that in any uh 
[00:14:30]  you know  I'm sure it was traumatic and everything  but you take a job where you can actually  just doing your job  go to prison for the rest of your life  it's astonishing that anybody would want to do that  and uh  a tip of the hat  to the men in blue  the men in blue  and women  no  no no no  just  just the men  just the men in blue  women in pink  little badges  they ought to dress them in pink  they shit with frilly skirts

[00:18:00]  thumbs up  thumbs up for the a-rock  good  yeah i read a few  for the e-rock  a few uh posts  about the e-rock situation  can we play that audio from uh  the other side  today  sure  cause it was a  heaven  it was like a  it was like a lifetime moment  it really was  for a shock jock show  we had like kind of a lifetime moment  yesterday with e-rock  we kinda got away from shock jockery  for a moment  and uh yeah e-rock  yeah yeah can we get that 
[00:18:30]  showed his sensitive side  alright we'll explain  that'll be your tease  but e-rock had a little  breakdown yesterday  oh  look at him  he's like oh god  it has something to do  with something we did on this  side of the radio show  that's that's why we gotta bring  what happened yesterday  over here to  to kinda wrap it up  into a nice little uh  package or a bow  and all  uh let's see if this makes sense  if not we'll just move on  generally boys are batman or spider-man  or any number of costumes  which seem to just be fine  it's the girls  all of their costumes  whether it's a nurse  or a teacher  or a police officer 
[00:19:00]  or a pirate  they all have these  sort of sexy interpretations  for young girls who are  seven years old  one woman is saying that  she just simply doesn't have  choices yet  her son can be a ninja fighter  and it's fine  but then she's gotta explain to  her daughter why she can't be  Hannah Montana  because the Hannah Montana costume  comes with a short skirt  and fishnet stockings  well and what's wrong with that  is that with a Hannah Montana  am I looking at the Hannah Montana  I guess  I don't know  that's fishnets 
[00:19:30]  well it is true  like the costumes  for the girls out there  no matter what age  they're all just sexy costumes  well young girls  for some reason  want to dress  like Britney Spears  like sluts  well Britney Spears  and Paris Hilton  started that  yeah  to the young girls  they think they're just dressing  they're dressing  they're dressing up  they're just you know  dressing nice  they're not dressing in a costume  and going  oh I'm gonna be so sexy  and sexual  they're not dressing in these  costumes and looking into the mirror  and going  wow my ass looks good 
[00:20:00]  yeah  they just think it's what you're  supposed to wear  it's just very normal  it's dress up  but if you're a bit older  there's only one way to look at it  these are very sexy outfits  but for some reason  because of Britney Spears  and Paris Hilton  this is completely acceptable  for young women to wear  yeah  the fishnets  that's a little odd  when you see them  on some of these pictures  like on an 8 year old  it's a bit strange  some of these pictures  that are printed out  well Danny found  like you got a girl  in a costume shop 
[00:20:30]  dressed kinda like a  like a Harry Potter student  but  yeah  but they sexed up the outfit  a girl dressed up like  like a little  she devil  the she devil  she devil  how old would you say she is  she's 11  how do you know  I just know  oh see  you see I thought the she devil  was a little older  see I hang out  what about Little Red Riding Hood  I hang out with kids  Little Red Riding Hood  how old  alright hold on  where's Little Red Riding Hood  I know this is a  oh she's a bit older  she's about 
[00:21:00]  I'm gonna give her 14  alright would you hit that  no  absolutely not  Little Red Riding Hood  absolutely not  of course not  there's plenty to choose  against the law  plenty to choose from  that are of legal age  depends on the state  you're in  exactly  no I mean  that does nothing for me  well absolutely nothing  state of frenzy  state of frenzy  here's more on the sexy outfit  I mean I do think  there's a certain amount  of projection here  I mean girls  little girls 
[00:21:30]  tend to wear skirts  that tend to show their knees  and stuff  and for us to say  oh that's too sexy  in other words  you can tell when it looks like  a hooker  some of those  in those pictures we showed  some kind of did to me  and some didn't  it kind of sexualizes young girls  I mean even the depictions  on the  alright hold on a second  alright what's wrong with the guy  this guy  check his computer  check his computer  immediately  I would  based on  nothing more  than past  performance  past 
[00:22:00]  convictions  in my opinion  his computer  his computer should be checked  because he protested  too much  it's one of those things  where it's like  it's freaking him out  so much  that I think  his computer  should be looked into  how the hell do you  I understand  you go  ah you know  these things are a little too safe  but he is  he's on the news  he's talking about it  he's  sexualizing them  and I can't  take it 
[00:22:30]  I can't look at this  it's driving me crazy  well history will show that  you're pretty close to  the truth I think  oh absolutely  the guys that yell and scream the most  are usually the  usually the  the problems  the problems  we will talk a little later  about another Republican  tripping over his own  unit  yeah  on his way to political greatness  yeah  Bobby Bigrigger  what's up Bobby  hey long time  no talk to you guys  yeah  who haven't lingered longer 
[00:23:00]  would you be able to explain  exactly how you can tell  how old a girl is  11  11 years old  I don't use that skill  on the uh  the underage  no he's just estimating  thanks Bobby  based on a two dimensional picture  Bobby Bigrigger's just proving that  uh proving that he lingers longer  I love that  what the hell is that saying  for politicians  the two things  don't get caught with a  dead girl or a live boy  yeah right  a dead girl or a live boy  is a career ender  is that really a 
[00:23:30]  live boy or a dead girl  yeah  yeah  we'll get into that after the break  dead boy acceptable  Nate in Jersey  helpful actually  Nate  Nate  Nate  yeah Dave  oh sorry Dave what's up  Dave your name's Nate  yeah Dave  Dave Nate  alright what's up Nate  hey  I just wanted to say that um  my daughter came home with a letter the other day from school about the costumes that she was not allowed to wear  and they weren't allowed to wear anything that had blood or guts or might scare other children 
[00:24:00]  these schools are ruining Halloween nowadays  yeah I read about that one too  there's some schools that were saying not only sexy clothes like that but um things that were might disturb other students might be a little too horrific for the sensitive little students  why don't we go  why don't we go against nature and protect the weak always  I don't get it  well that's what we're doing  and that's why we're raising a nation of weaklings  and the Chinese are coming  and we're doomed  we're doomed  the Chinese are so coming  they are so on their way to taking over the world 
[00:24:30]  they're posturing for it  of course  like they're not trying to do anything yet  but they're like saving up  it's like the beginning of Monopoly  they're just kinda buying everything  and waiting for you to land on their hotels on the boardwalk  and go  oh boy  how'd that happen  and we're just giving it to them at this point  you know I  thank you Nate  cause I was walking by a schoolyard yesterday on the way home  and I kinda took a peek into the schoolyard  cause I saw lots of costumes right  and the thought I had as I was walking by was 
[00:25:00]  these costumes are completely lame  yeah they're not scary  there's no creativity  and there's no like scariness to them anymore  I think all the costumes of kids should be dressed like flowers  oh look another daffodil  so you can't wear anything to school that's gonna scare other kids  but the whole point of Halloween is to get kinda scary  it's a scary holiday  you're supposed to hang scary things up  god forbid  please take down your nooses  I don't know what's going on with the school system 
[00:25:30]  but they are just lost  they're trying so hard  they are lost  this politically correct  everyone's okay  don't offend or scare anybody  and it's just raising a bunch of wusses  alright let's say hi to Joe in Philly  Joe what's up?  hey guys  love you guys  love the show  thank you Joe  thanks  hey anytime  love it  you know you're about to pick on poor fatty here

[00:26:30]  and E-Rock spanked her so hard that he left a really bad hand print  everyone remembers that right?  oh it was awful  there are a lot of people out there lingering longer  they remember that  let me um  oh you got the actual hit right?  let me play the little clip  where is that?  right there  oh it looks like speak  oh okay it's E-Rock spank  okay  um yeah here it is  him uh spanking her  ah  she was in agony 
[00:27:00]  pain  he pretty much  did it closed  uh  he did it with a closed hand  and just kind of  like wailed her  not yet an open hand  I  I think he hit her with the  with the palm  no he hit her with the  low palm  the hammer side  where did you hit her E-Rock?  low palm?  microphone  yeah he went like this  the meaty part of the hand way down here  yeah but  you know your pinky  the pinky  if you run it down to the hand side  that meat on the side of your hand 
[00:27:30]  that kind of  um  that kind of went  went  went with the hit?  yeah with the hit  it was almost a karate chop slap  okay  yeah thank you  karate chop  uh slap  and  you can hear it cause it's not a sharp  smack  it has a thud to it  yeah  sounds like a punch  all right very good  so  uh  well that caused problems in his uh personal life  with his fiancée 
[00:28:00]  fiancée  fiancée  fiancée  he basically gave uh  a talking to  oh  that he was never to be in the same studio with her  or ever talk to her again  or look at her  or look at her  or look at her  never to even look at her  that was the uh  speech that his fiancée gave him  and the stars aligned yesterday  the last day of Iraqtober  Justine Jolie came in with some of her girlfriends  to say hi to us  and uh  and Iraq was standing about three feet away from her  and every time she moved toward him

[00:31:00]  you get ACDC stoned  then you got a fight on your hands  yeah  you had to rub it in  with the Boston Red Sox  World Series  championship hat  right?  we rub a little bit  you know that's what we do  get used to it  it's nice right?  you win a few  in a couple of years  you do that  and then it becomes  the country winds up hating you  you become the  oh it's a bought team  you'll start hearing stuff like that  that's the kind of hate you want  that's like the rough sex hate 
[00:31:30]  you know it just feels really good  actually I'm enjoying the fact  that the Red Sox won the World Series  I'm a Mets fan  I hate the Yankees  I'd rather see the Red Sox win  every single time  before the Yankees  Pedro has the  little fun fact  largest member  in baseball  so I hear  really?  wow  from a few sources  yeah  we thought Big Papi was the biggest  but no it turns out Pedro's  he's fully loaded  he's fully loaded  wow  but if you have a name like Big Papi  you gotta think 
[00:32:00]  he's not so big now  like in Nick Pedro  he's probably as small as  Danny Bonaduce  Danny Bonaduce  he's probably got like  four and a half  they call him Big Papi  just cause it's degrading  on some level  that's why Randy Johnson  was his nickname  the big unit  that was what Randy Johnson's nickname meant  alright  you know Jimmy brings up a good point  because you had  you get the big fat guys  and their name is Tiny  yeah  yeah  that's hysterical when they do that  in movies  he's got a little miniature pinch  when his name is Beast  alright  I got it  Jesus  how much money is Dane losing 
[00:32:30]  just sitting here  he really is like Bill Gates  like if he drops money  and then bends to pick it up  he loses more money  than if he's walking  no no no  all my money's tied up in cash  Dane's career is just amazing  just when you  you think it couldn't get any better  he does all the World Series  freaking spots  I know  I know don't you think  they should have aired those  a few more times?  you were  it was like every 2 seconds  it was the  alright Dane  we get it  the World Series  I flush my own toilet  and hear my voice go 
[00:33:00]  there's only one October  it was a lot  it was very dramatic  well you know  the whole idea was  we wanted to do this real innovative thing  where we were cutting in  the clips  that were basically happening  you know  day to day  game to game  and do this kind of evolving  series of commercials  which I thought was really cool  but it definitely  when you're putting them on  during the games  and people are already watching  the baseball  that's what starts getting  a little grading  people going  dude why are you telling me this  I'm here  it's like being at a party  it's a great party 
[00:33:30]  and being like  you should come to this party  it's like I'm in the kitchen dude  I'm at the party  no you gotta come to the party  it's the best party in town  I'm here  I'm sitting on the couch  those commercials should have ran  on other channels  like VH1  or Lifetime  anywhere else  besides  besides during the actual game  get the women watching  uh  rape movies  yeah  over to watch the world series  geez  let me let me think of that storyline  woman finds  bestest  bestest ever guy in the world  uh 
[00:34:00]  friends  kinda suspicious of him  she's blinded by love  he turns out  to punch her in the face everyday  until she has to set his bed on fire  and kill him  and then she gets off the hook  somehow  somewhere  yeah  starring Markie Post  well cause she falls in love with the investigator  starring Markie Post  always  oh yeah  and Suzanne Plichette  Valerie Bertinelli  in a very special Lifetime exclusive  can we turn the heat on in here by the way  yeah Jesus  is this place built on an Indian burial ground  why am I sweating like Shack of the Fowl on 
[00:34:30]  Jesus  it's  it's  killing me  usually it's too cold in here  so I don't know what's going on  I know  I'm jacket guy everyday in here  and today it's  it's baking  did I just see Xanadu on Broadway  and is that real  or is this  that's real  there's Xanadu  Xanadu  yeah  nice  yeah they've run out of ideas for Broadway  so  have they completely run out  obviously  yeah  there has to be a theater  or a few theaters  doing a few Disney things  at any given moment  right  so they took off 
[00:35:00]  Beauty and the Beast  yeah  to put in The Little Mermaid  does it matter  it's a bunch of  of  kids with crap in their diapers  sitting there just  uh  looking at the pretty colors  does it matter  if it's Beauty and the Beast  or The Little Mermaid  well Ariel's story  really is one of  great passion  it should be brought  to the stage  I don't know how they're gonna pull that one off  she doesn't have legs  was there a demand for Xanadu 
[00:35:30]  was there people  that's  Kevin Spacey's actually starring in it  is he really  no  I believe  I don't know at this point  Jimmy is such a good actor  is what it is  Jimmy's a great actor  and he fools us all the time  we've all heard the same rumors about Spacey  yeah  was there a demand for Xanadu  that's a very good question  that needs to be answered  so  hey you're playing the garden  you're playing the old Boston Garden  you're all over the joint  yeah the Rough Around the Edges tour man 
[00:36:00]  starts off in Toronto  at the Air Canada Centre tomorrow night  how cool is that  the Air Canada Centre  yeah it's wild  I'd imagine there's a  there's about four or five hundred seats in that place  perhaps  we open section Z  he's doing the Air Canada Centre  every gig I do has  and restaurant at the end of the end  the Air Canada Centre and restaurant  you know you made it when you're playing a place called the Air Canada  well Canada Centre  Dane actually flies into the place  right  into the stadium 
[00:36:30]  literally  and gets off the plane  and he's there  performing  he's gonna be also in DC on November 16th  and then there's two shows  it's the TD Bank North Garden in Boston on the 17th of November  and then here in New York at the Garden on the 18th of November  I think only one show has tickets available on that one  yeah the Garden here in New York we added another show  and those are  of course  yeah we had to do it  we had to do a late night  it's a Sunday night too man  it's pretty wild  so coming in  the most amazing thing I've ever seen as far as Dane Cook goes 
[00:37:00]  Jimmy and I were up in Boston for one of your shows  which was amazing  just you on a stage  I don't know how you pull that one off  but you do every time  and then we left the place going wow  that was just an amazing show  and they were lined up for a second show  at the old Boston Garden  yeah  imagine that  that was wild  you know that second show went really  turn around the Boston Garden  the old Boston Garden  and they did it in like 40 minutes  it was even more incredible  that's insane  I don't know how they pulled that off  it takes that much time just to get the drunks out of the bathroom 
[00:37:30]  after a show  the stories after that show too  I ran the light on that second show  and it ended up being like I think like 2 hours and 40 minutes  but what I didn't realize is that like the tea and everything stops  at like you know 1 or whatever it was  people were writing emails like dude  I just slept on the street and went to work  in the clothing that I went to see you in  it was just a cluster F at the end of that show  oh the union fees must have been lovely on that one  yeah yeah that was that too 
[00:38:00]  how does it feel to be like the loved hated comic amongst other comics  because I've heard you know we talk to we see a lot of comics  you're it's not like they hate you  right as a person  but they hate your career  they hate your  they cannot stand your success  I used to really you know  it used to kind of irk me and frustrate me  because it was like I'm the least controversial guy  you know what I mean  it's like even when I was hanging out in New York  I'd do my gigs and I just went home 
[00:38:30]  and you know basically you know just kind of waited for the next show  I was I've never been involved in kind of the drama of it all  so for me it was always like  I don't know these half these guys don't really know me  I just kind of deliver and get the hell out of there  but now it's like controversy is really good for business  yeah apparently so  yeah yeah  so on the way the way I'm looking at it  if you're one side or the other I guess it's it's boring  so as long as people are chatting about you  then then it it helps tickets and it helps CDs  and all that good stuff  I think sometimes you get people also that want some kind of tie-in 
[00:39:00]  it's like the old you know I kind of knew the guy  and you know maybe years ago  and then they want to do some kind of tie-in with you  so they try to create some kind of controversy  sure sure yeah no  and some of them are you know some of them are good  there's been some great slams out there  some of them are completely like you know ridiculous  but I still have to you know kind of cut them out  and save them anyway in the in the scrapbook  did you see the mad TV  the guy that did the impression of you  I like the I saw that one I thought he was just all right  but I thought Jason did a killer job 
[00:39:30]  he had a killer job on SNL the other day  I texted him after and told him that I thought it was really flattering  and I was laughing my ass off  I was like I was like that he really you know  he really kind of had my essence and I was sitting there  I didn't know they were going to do it either  I was just watching and I'm like oh my god man that's crazy  that's gotta freak you out though when you're watching some crap  and it's like what they're imitating me  yeah you're just hoping that he gets laughs doing you  because then that would even double suck  if it's like you're not funny and then people doing you're not funny 
[00:40:00]  he's bombing as me  somehow you take responsibility  if I had to say you suck about him doing me  then what does that say about me it's very Freudian  so I uh no I had a good laugh about it  and uh and then um you know got ready for the next gig  I guess you gotta like at the point you're at  have some kind of sense of humor built up  because it's it I mean the because not being in movies  and then uh the the the love the love interest things  that end up in the tabloids  I I mean I I couldn't imagine uh what that would be like 
[00:40:30]  opening up when I go oh this is who I'm supposedly having sex with  the best thing about the tabloids is like 98% of it is wrong  but the thing that they always get exactly right is what you're eating  you're eating they always know the foods  they always always know it's like they'll blow everything else  it's like no that wasn't a date it was this was that  but it's like yes I had the pasta primavera  that is exactly they knew what I was eating  but I wasn't canoodling I was not canoodling in a corner 
[00:41:00]  so that Jessica Simpson uh stuff was crap  Jessica Simpson was like we were just hanging out you know  yeah you should have just said yeah I I did her  well I have to I have to also say yeah it was just crap  so uh yeah yeah yeah  he didn't deny it  I'm not I'm not fez here  come on I'm a classy guy  I grew up with five sisters you know  you should just go like back to high school like uh you know  mentality there and just say yeah I did her  so  yeah but if you start doing that then nobody will bang you 
[00:41:30]  that is exactly it Jimmy  that's it  you're blowing up you kiss and tell dude  yeah  you know you gotta start to  see that's brilliant  you're blowing up girls spots man you don't wanna do that  cause I read that stuff I'm like why isn't Dane admitting this  everybody wants to be with Jessica Simpson but  Jimmy just explained it  yeah you can't  no  Geraldo years later wrote a book about everyone behind him that he did  that's fine but you know when you're 50 years old you can write a book  but when you're when you're still hitting them  you gotta be patient  plenty of bragging time later in your golden years 
[00:42:00]  I will write a very uh very memorable book someday  speaking of bitches uh when was the last time you heard from Bob Kelly  we had him puking on the show the other day  was he puking again  oh he's great man  I'd love to see it  yeah I'd text Bobby today and let him know I'm here  but he's he's probably sleeping after having  called one of his fans and talked for four and a half hours  this Bobby sent me  this is why I wanna slap Bob in his face  we were at the cellar and he showed me on MySpace  how you can send somebody a text message on MySpace 
[00:42:30]  but he's like you gotta enter their phone number  and I'm like what am I gonna do  enter everyone on MySpace's number  oh that's why he wanted to do it  let me tell you what Bob Kelly does  especially with you Dane  um he wanted to show me a picture  during uh the virus tour  so he goes and check this out  so he pulls out his phone  and before he could click click the picture  he had it in his phone book contacts  and he had your name highlighted in red  so I and then he goes check out this picture 
[00:43:00]  and then clicks it strategically leaving enough time for me to see Dane Cook in red  I go you are just a bitch  I go you had to let me see you have Dane's phone number in your phone  I go it's nothing about the picture  I go I don't even wanna see the goddamn picture now  cause it wasn't your motive  I always tell Bobby too  it's like there's certain people like you know  I have certain contacts  you change the name just in case  if anybody ever  right if they find the phone  you know it's like somebody  Johnny Bravo's in my  you know you don't know who it is  but it's like  well let's go with Jessica Simpson 
[00:43:30]  Bobby red flags me  and puts me on the main page  of his phone  hey did you guys see his wedding online  did you  were you all invited  we were all the seller watching  yeah it was great  oh my god dude  it was too late for me  I called Bobby up  I said the best part of the entire thing was  he would you know  he was mic'd  he had the lapel mic  did you guys notice that like  every time  every time the Hawaiian  what was he a priest  or you know  the you know  the high priestess  the sacrifice leader  or whatever that guy was  every time he mentioned like 
[00:44:00]  anything long term  like this love is forever  Bobby would put his head down  and sigh into the mic  so he's like  he does it like seven or eight times  and he's just  it kills me  every single time  it's like  it's louder than the waves crashing  he's just Bobby going  oh commitment  oh Jesus Christ  what am I doing  your bow should never have ums  before you speak  um 
[00:44:30]  I love you  wanna be with you  um  forever  and ever  shouldn't be saying  what else  during your vows  um  what else you guys wanna talk about  let me  let me think  um  but I'm really happy to those kids  and their  and their  and their um  their marriage circle  it was nicer than I thought it would be  it actually came out like  really nice  I wanted to tease him really badly  but I was like yeah it looked good  no it was great  and then he released Butterflies 
[00:45:00]  and I said Bobby  I said Bobby every cool thing you did  over the last 20 years  is done  when that one butterfly  landed  on his shoulder  and he  it was like a Lilliputian moment  where he like  picked it up  and he released it into the air  I'm like you're done dude  every cool story is over  it's over  it's literally over  I never heard of anyone  releasing Butterflies  you didn't get there  you didn't get to the part  where at the end the box opens  and a hundred Butterflies  comes out  and magic  goes through the air  he told us he had to freeze the Butterflies  to make sure they were going to survive 
[00:45:30]  the ceremony  oh no  and so they weren't completely thought out  so a few of them were like  yeah a few just kind of hit the ground  yeah hit the ground  went flop  to the sand  throws them up and the end  there's a hundred dead little things  you can imagine  normally with Bob  you see them on the Discovery Channel  he's on his hands and knees  with the butterflies on his back  and he's swatting at them with his tail  that idiot  trying to be dramatic  hey he's a good egg  hey he's a good egg  good luck to those kids  and number one comedy in America  then in real life  I saw the commercial yesterday  they're like 
[00:46:00]  the number one comedy in America  yeah it's a  it's a nice movie man  it really is  you know  Steve Carell is just  that guy is unbelievable  really funny  and you know  just got the chops too  acting wise  you know it's odd though  and we were talking to him  the other day  the whole thing where he was  on the Daily Show  you know  for quite a while  and then  all of a sudden  I'm watching the TV  and I hear  Steve Carell  in an Oscar worthy performance  with that dramatic guy voice  and everything  and I'm like what the 
[00:46:30]  Steve Carell  right  Oscar worthy performance  yeah I know  and I guess so  no no man  he's you know  he's  the thing about Steve  he's admittedly too  like the sweatiest human being on earth  he's one of those guys  that like just  he's fine  everything's good  we were filming in Rhode Island  it was actually kind of  it was kind of cold  and then like if any  there was any kind of glitch  or whatever like something  it was like  he was just immediately drenched  and he would have to be  you know  like they had an amazing chamois  that they would just put on him  and dry him off 
[00:47:00]  that is horrible  in like  because believe me  not even trying to  meh  make any kind of  yeah we're in showbiz today  showbiz  comparisons  yeah like the new digs here  dude this is great  the new digs over  at the other place  are even better  when you're  filming something  and sweating  and sweating  and you got to stand there  because the shirt you're wearing  just any drop  that comes from anywhere  looks like  it just turns into a huge puddle  yeah  I don't know how people do it  in movies  or over any length of time 
[00:47:30]  well we couldn't move  because if the shirt hit our skin  it would just  it would turn  it would spot  yeah it would be a huge wet spot  and like frozen in between  takes  I guess you have to be good  and confident in what you're doing  so you don't sweat  I will  I'll out myself  the only procedure I've ever done  in my life  a few years ago  I was told that you could do  these things  these injections  under your armpit  that would stop you from sweating  and I'm not like  I don't sweat profusely  but still I was going to this thing  and I'm like  it'd be great to not sweat  so when I had the injections done  oh you did  yeah I had it done 
[00:48:00]  under both my pits  took like 10 minutes  the guy just went in there  and like did three shots  three shots  now here's the best part  I didn't sweat for five months there  so I would have a dry spot here  and basically sweat around it  I'm not even kidding man  it worked unbelievably  no sweat  it had to find another way out  I guess  it's something to do with Botox  I believe  yeah yeah it was three Botox  on each pit  it was ridiculous  I should never have done it  but no I didn't sweat for  for half a year  I know a guy  a comic who like  he sweats so much 
[00:48:30]  he wears a shirt  he wears a short t-shirt  and a t-shirt under it  and I've seen him lift his arms  and I've seen folded napkins  oh yeah  and I'm just like what on hell  he lives in  and how is Godfrey  Godfrey  hey we have to take a break  what's your deal  can you stay  yeah I'm hanging out  alright  cause I heard you have a busy day today  I do  oh you can hang for another 20 minutes  great  we got Dane Cook in studio  what's the big plug Dane?  Ruffer on the Edges  new comedy CD  Since Retaliation  it comes out November 13th  me and Celine Dion  going toe to toe  DC versus CD 
[00:49:00]  I'm funnier  toe to camel toe  yeah  it's Opie and Anthony  more with Dane Cook in just a bit  Dane Cook in just a bit  if you want yeah  we're hanging today  we got a very busy show  it's Opie and Anthony  you know commercials kind of  get in the way sometimes  of the hang  yeah  Dane Cook was telling us some  great interesting stories  during the break  and now we got to kind of  I don't know  recapture the moment  re-act  impossible 
[00:49:30]  I know it's impossible  it never works right  but whoa hey  Wow  Penn Jillette  hey Penn  here he is  how are you doing man  how are you doing  what's going on man  what's up Penn  how are you doing dude  what's happening  Dane Cook  what's up sir  hey man  you can sit and hang man  you can sit on the couch  we just make up this crap  as we go along  couch of honor  we were talking about  the World Series  and he said that  this one doesn't really  compare to the 2004  before he's even admitting it 
[00:50:00]  well I mean  yeah of course  0-4 was just  you know you felt like  that  we all felt like  we were on the field  during that game  whether you're watching it  I was there  I actually went with my pop  and I was telling you guys  Dane you were on the field  no no I didn't actually  really allowed  I didn't run  I think you were on the  official Red Sox roster  at this point  but yeah so I did those  never say no to this guy  I did those spots  and when they came back  and said you know  what do you want  I said you know 
[00:50:30]  I just want the seats  that me and my dad sat in  for the World Series  I lost my pop this year  so it was  lost him in the mall  I just haven't found him in  jeez  so yeah  that was basically  working for seats  at that point  so I got the Bush  stadium seats  which was pretty  the actual seats  that he sat in  with his dad  well that's pretty cool  that's what they told me  anyway they might have  slapped another number  oh they better not  yeah they're like  yeah  with a Cardinals logo  sticking on the back 
[00:51:00]  yeah  and you said  that was the only time  you saw your dad  get really excited  and jump up and down  like crazy right?  yeah my dad was like  one of those guys that  you know he was like  he built the old school  he was like you know  original big you know  his hands were like  you know the rock creature  from Never Ending Story  he was just you know  all work all the time  and yeah when they  finally won the game  it was like I didn't see  my dad ever you know  do more than like a fist pump  and he was jumping like  he was on a trampoline  he was using high voice  he was like I'm here  this is the best 
[00:51:30]  so yeah it was a great day man  very memorable  it's always awkward  when your dad does something  for like the first time  like later in your life  like maybe as a kid  whatever but  I remember the first time  I saw my dad cry  we were watching  Passion of the Christ  oh jeez  and I was sitting next to him  it was a movie he wanted to see  I didn't want to see that crap  see your dad  I didn't want to see that crap  but he did  you know he was brought up  you know hardcore religion  I didn't know there was  going to be that kind of  humiliation on this shit  it's like so much more hardcore  than I was ready for  it was horrible  you're watching your dad 
[00:52:00]  cry at the Passion of the Christ  it's an interesting  I'm trying to think  when did my dad die  you know cry at a Jew dying  when did he care  but  did he ever care about a Jew  getting beaten  I'm thinking no  I'm going back  and kind of  but the point is  there's no kind of warm moment  with my dad dying  you know crying in a racist movie  I'm not even  you know a drunk made a movie  my dad just kept  crying and crying and crying  you know this Jew hating  drugs making a movie  and dad just sobbing 
[00:52:30]  but I'm not even going  for the warm moment  like he cried for the first time  at Passion of the Christ  and I looked at him  like this is awkward  this is kind of awkward  it is awkward  like I don't know what to do  like do you start  like covering your dad  and going it's going to be ok  don't you say everything  don't you say everything  on the radio maybe  the first time I ever  something bad  Jesus  hell no  damn dignity  for Christ's sake  that movie was actually  the first time I saw my father laugh  I'm going to cry  you killed me man  that's where I was going  seeing a Jew getting whipped  that's funny  yeah me and my dad  just elbowed each other 
[00:53:00]  we kind of  eye contact them  Christ is going down  and he jumped in the air  like I'd never seen him before  you know  when Christ died  just both feet in the air  both hands pumping  high voice  woohoo  Christ is dead  it was great  wonderful moment  my dad  I'm trying to think of the first time I saw my dad cry  let's think about the first time  alright yeah let's go around the room  and Danilo beat that guy with the phone in Goodfellas  my dad cried  Maury's wigs  Maury was  he wanted his money 
[00:53:30]  Maury's wigs  Jim you ever see your dad cry there?  yeah  or the first time do you remember?  when he realized that RuPaul was actually a tranny  we'll do it  yeah no my dad was an emotional guy  was he?  he still is  really?  yeah he's an emotional guy  we wanted to tell you something  your dad did just die during that sentence  he didn't  he used the wrong case  dad's dead sorry  at least he saw me skyrocket to mediocrity  yeah no he's an emotional guy  yeah  well I guess that confirms the atheist 
[00:54:00]  what do you mean by that?  I don't know  you don't have to be atheist to laugh at Christ dying  now don't  have all these misconceptions  anyone can laugh at Christ dying  ok  ok  I didn't know that  yeah you can't  it's a free world  you guys are like sucking up to him right?  no we had a run in  he got us fired  he's right  giving him that much power is just so disgusting  and he comes on  he's a guy that runs out of his basement  he's like nobody 
[00:54:30]  you know the Catholics have someone who speaks for them  it's a guy with a hat  that's the guy they have  this is another guy who doesn't speak for Catholics  just claims to  and you guys were like you know  sucking up to him  no that's not true  no we weren't  you weren't?  no we originally had him on to attack him  and he was such a nice guy  such a smart guy  a sweet guy  who said Trey Parker and Matt Stone should die  that's kind of nice guy he is  I'm talking about the way he dealt with us  what he said about them is up to him  I'm telling what he dealt with us is 
[00:55:00]  that he admitted like  hey look you guys  they said you guys did something in the church  I didn't see it  I'm the head of the Catholic League  what do you want me to do?  he was honest at least with us  about the situation we dealt with us  so I'm not going to be a phony and attack him  just on the principle of attacking him  that's why we originally had him on the show  was to attack him  but then he turned out to be okay  and it's like what am I going to do?  how does he be okay when he does  he was honest about it  as far as a religious leader  or any type of leader like that  those guys are usually awful  at least he was  he admitted  he admitted  that he had heard the broadcast  he admitted that it was inappropriate 
[00:55:30]  for him to fake  that he had an organization  to try to get you thrown off the air  when you did nothing wrong?  he didn't use those words  okay  unfortunately his fake organization  had a lot of power  with the big boys upstairs  you know I think that has gone away  that's the unfortunate part  I think he's kind of gone a little  even a little nutty  even for them now  a lot of the organizations  have fake power  they have that like  like you said in a basement  they send it out  and these corporations get scared  because they think 
[00:56:00]  there's an organization  that's ready to rally  thousands of people  that's how I built my whole career  I don't know  it's got to be in the tens of people  in the tens  dozens of people  I have no idea  but they're so scared of boycotts  corporations  that on the threat of a boycott  they'll just fire people  I think they should wait  and see how many people  actually show up  and if it's more people  than the listeners or viewers  then you have a point  but other than that  well we're trying to get  pretty safe saying that  when has it been more people  than the listeners in history 
[00:56:30]  the boycott  never  yeah I think by definition  never  the boycott can be that big  yeah  well why don't you try to explain that  to the guys once again upstairs  that for some reason  getting religious again  the man upstairs  the man upstairs  the suits cower to the special interest groups  it amazes us  yeah it is amazing  because Anthony says a lot on this show  let's play this through  and see what a boycott can actually do  to a radio show especially  let's uh  okay we'll defend  Dog the Bounty Hunter  alright 
[00:57:00]  wow  anybody with a mullet  can drop the N-bomb as often as they would  have you heard about Dog the Bounty Hunter  anyone  just fill me in  I just read the headline  wow  you really  have you heard yet  I just read the headline  oh did he  oh  well I guess his son is going out with a  with a black girl  black girl yeah  and he's not happy about that  and uh  there was a little voicemail  that he left on his son's machine  yeah  yeah  and I guess the son is not a 
[00:57:30]  not a good son  because it seems like it  it got into the hands of the National Enquirer  it seems the dog loves the N-bomb  that's just  just loves it  that's really as bad as talking about your dad dying  crying at the back of Christ  a little like that  it is amazing though  like the fact that this guy  he's an ex-convict  who's a bounty hunter  it's like alright he is what he is  but people actually care that he says it  who cares  I don't care what he says to his son  oh there's the first defense  yeah who cares  big deal  what I'm saying  did you hear the tape?  no  oh Jesus 
[00:58:00]  just so you know  there's no defense in this voice  just so people listening should listen to this voice  and say  hey he didn't defend him at all did he?  just keep that  get that very clear  well here's  here's  here's  here's the actual  voicemail I guess  right?  listen to this  you're gonna play it?  heavily beeped  wish we could just play it  there's not a lot to say the n-word on the radio anymore  are you crazy?  I'm not taking a chance on some  I don't care if she's a Mexican  a whore 
[00:58:30]  whatever  it's not because she's black  it's because  we use the word  sometimes here  I'm not gonna take a chance  ever in life  losing everything I've worked for  for 30 years  because some  heard us say  and turned us into the inquire magazine  our career is over  I'm not taking that chance  at all  yes you are  never in life  never  oops  never  if bleeps was  we would  all say  you 
[00:59:00]  and you know that  a little rough to follow with the bleeps  but you get the idea  you could fit it in  every bleep is the n-bomb  so  well no there were some that were  the F yeah  it was a verb at one point  an adjective  uh yeah yeah  it was a verb  it was a verb  in I think the second instance  he is so done  and how he's saying like  that'll never happen  I'm never gonna let it happen  let it happen as I'm letting it happen  right now  he's making it happen  don't email it stupid  then just say you were hacked into 
[00:59:30]  you get the defense already don't you  of course  you think the girlfriend got a hold of that  uh well either that or the son  was uh pretty outraged  that his father was telling him  to break up  with this girl  uh because they dropped the n-bomb  around the house a lot I guess  yeah  and uh  you know  the son probably in love  was pissed at his father  it's gonna be a great thanksgiving  get the dog  oh yeah  great thanksgiving  yeah  oh 
[01:00:00]  how did he get that invitation  yeah we got the dog explain why he uses the n-word  here it is  if Lisa brought the black at home  yeah  it's not that they're black  it's none of that  it's that we use the word  we don't mean you  scum  without a soul  we don't mean that  but America would think we mean that  well  well  well let's join America  thank you  yes  exactly  no he won  he got me back  the last part of the explanation  just made it all like  okay 
[01:00:30]  yeah  you should have plugged your show at that point  because I would have tuned in  and we're not taking a chance  on losing everything  we got  over a racial slur  because our son goes with the girl like that  you can't do that Tucker  you can't expect Gary, Bonnie, Cecily  all them young kids  because I'm in love for seven months  I f*** that  so I'll help you get another job  but you cannot work here  unless you break up with her 
[01:01:00]  and she's out of your life  I can't handle that  wow  I didn't hear this part  oh yeah  that's just  that's the son then gone  alright  yeah now Tommy  here you go pops  yeah alright  done  look what I do now  the only dog says  his son can't work for him  unless he leaves the girl  Teresa told that girl  never to come by her  house again  because I told Dwayne Lee  the same thing  you're going to have your wife  hanging around with that girl  you're not working for dog  the bounty hunter  Dwayne Lee called this morning  and Teresa  and said  we are not hanging around 
[01:01:30]  with that girl  so just like Dwayne Lee  just like you  if you hang around  with that black girl  I do not want you  in my house  because it's already been proven  that you run your mouth to her  that's it right there  so you just let me know  I gotta go  what you're doing later  bye  yeah  talk to you later alright  that's a wonderful father  right there  yeah ouch  I don't know who's worse  the father or the son  for selling the  I imagine dog the bounty hunter  doesn't cry  when he watches 
[01:02:00]  Passion of the Christ  I imagine he does  that sounds like a guy who does  there's probably a few movies  he does cry at though  yeah roots because it got better  he hates the next generation  right  it's all communist propaganda  there's probably a few  he actually sheds a tear over  so what do you think of that huh  he's done  A&E suspended the production of the show  oh did they  yeah  they put out a statement saying  they will investigate  you know this is  right after we asked for the hypothetical situation 
[01:02:30]  we have it  more people will boycott that  than watched it  yeah probably  you know you asked for a hypothetical  and got a reality  it's good  yeah yeah  well now I guess  Roy Ennis came out  and said that he's  regardless of what he thinks he is  he's on television  so he's a role model  and I don't know what kind of role model he was  before this clip came out  I didn't see much there  except for a big blonde mullet  and a huge obese wife 
[01:03:00]  but he was a role model  so Roy Ennis said  he said  he should be taken off the air  Roy Ennis is usually  fairly conservative  you know  from core  they're not  they're not typically like  like sharped in  or screaming for anything racial  to be taken off the air  he's already scrambling  to apologize  his apology was ridiculous  he's trying to find out  a bunch of black friends  to start hanging out with  yeah  he's got Byron Allen  fighting for him  he's eating dinner  Roscoe's chicken and waffles tonight 
[01:03:30]  hey Steven S from Bayshore  he writes  dog the noose nodder  instead of dog the bounty hunter  oh he  hey where's the apology  I don't know we have it  what a doodle  apologize  I like the way he referred to himself  as in the third person  with his nickname in there too  yeah  he plugged the name of the show  yeah  in a statement  the 54 year old Chapman  said  he has the utmost respect  and aloha  for black people  who have suffered so much  due to racial discrimination 
[01:04:00]  and acts of hatred  I did not mean to add  yet another slap  in the face of an entire race  of people who have brought  so many gifts to the world  he said  I am ashamed of myself  and I pledge to do  whatever I can  to repair this damage  I have caused  Chapman said  my sincerest heartfelt apologies  go out to every person  I have offended  for my regrettable use  a very inappropriate language  I am deeply disappointed  in myself  for speaking out of anger  to my son  and using such hateful terms  and here it is  in a private phone conversation 
[01:04:30]  apology down the crapper  oh  well  not as sincere  when you say  hey  no one was supposed to hear this  Norton  sorry I made the tattletale  that pretty much blew  the entire apology  that someone wrote for him  it was like  an entire publicist statement  and he's like  I just added something  at the end  yeah 
[01:05:00]  don't worry about it  the publicist pulling the hair out  no  don't worry about it  you're an idiot  it's gonna be good though  I added one line  I'm totally sorry  I think it's really  gonna help me out  yeah this one's gonna get me  out of the jam up  I'm sorry I've offended  a whole race of people  and then he penciled in  even though we told him  that one  how many times have we been  handed stuff like that  we're like  we would never say  this in this way  a statement  a statement  in a private phone conversation  and then Chapman said 
[01:05:30]  the clip was taken  out of context  what  what context  he's got a son  he doesn't want going out  with a black chick  because they dropped the  n-bomb all the time  and he didn't want the  inquirer getting a hold of it  so she did  and the inquirer got a hold of it  there is context  there's pure context  it's all context  it's all context  yeah  well we adjusted  the theme song for  Dog the Bounty Hunter  it's quick  here we go  yeah 
[01:06:00]  yeah  the fear and darkness  all around you  the  are on the run  now wait a minute  what happens  what happens  I'll hunt you down  cause I'm the dog  I'm the dog  I'm the dog  I'm the dog 
[01:06:30]  I'm the dog  I'm the dog  I'm the dog  I'm the dog  they don't say that  in the theme song do they  I don't remember that  well we're just trying to save his show  he is  change the theme song a little bit  he's done  but it's frightening  so done  I don't know  I guess it really is  it sounds bad  but I don't know why anybody cares  what a guy does in his personal life  when he's not like  his show is that he catches criminals  at gunpoint 
[01:07:00]  I know they do  but it's like  why would anybody care  A&E cares because they're representing  the network  he's representing the network  a lot of people are saying  he's a bounty hunter in Hawaii  which is like  give him one day in the Brooklyn  or the Bronx  and he'd be dead  oh is that where the show is  yeah  yeah  it's based in Hawaii  I have no idea  he also said  I was disappointed in the choice  of a friend  not due to her race  but her character  he said  however I should never have used that term 
[01:07:30]  repeatedly  repeatedly  every part of speech  used it more than Michael Richards I think  I think he did  Chapman said he's meeting  with his spiritual advisor  Reverend Tim Story  who is black  yeah  and hopes to meet  with other black leaders  so as he says  so they can see  who I really am  and teach me  the right thing to do  to make things right again  I think  in a private conversation 
[01:08:00]  of course  in another private conversation  don't teach them  the right thing to do  just give up your show  and go away  yeah that's pretty much it  Jimmy the Greek  you're done  sounds a bit desperate  I know that all my fans  are deeply disappointed in me  as well  as I have tried  to be a model  for doing the right thing  he said  I did not do the right thing  this time  and hope you will forgive me  he's looking for  his forgiveness  what we worry  is that maybe  some of his fans  aren't appalled  by this  I would assume  that's the biggest horror 
[01:08:30]  his entire demo  I'm not sure  the entire demo  but there is a fan  or two that went  yeah  and that's what A&E's  I bet  yeah  no I'm sticking with  the entire demo  we're gonna really go  with that one  right not a one  alright we gotta  take another break here  so uh  staying  going  Dane's  awesome  Dane Cook staying  we got Penn Jillette  where's Teller  I heard  yeah we heard  about that  we heard something stupid 
[01:09:00]  that radio guys actually  make believe Teller's sitting  next to you the whole time  well no it's better than that  say like you know  and I used to do morning radio  when we were touring  you know now we're in Vegas  all the time  I don't do much of it  I actually liked your radio show  they played it here in New York  and I listened all the time  well thank you so much  you're a very interesting guy  but I would do that you know  every morning  I'd have to get up at like  four in the morning  after flying in at two  and do morning radio  to pimp my stupid show  you know  and I mean really  one out of ten times  a really high amount  the guy would come in and go  you know I was in the shower pen  this morning 
[01:09:30]  and I get this idea  you know Teller doesn't talk  so let's say he's in the studio  and then you just  I'll ask him questions  you just kind of play along with me  okay  and that was okay  you know what do I care  I'm half asleep  but then he would do this thing  that was just  so infuriating  and they all would do it  he would go  so I got Teller in the studio  here I want to ask a few questions  so Teller  what do you like being on the road  how do you like it  and he would hold his hand out  and make the shh sound to me  because maybe I forgot the gag  don't 
[01:10:00]  I would sit next to this guy  that's the top  so he'd hold his hand out  and then I would go  and this is the thing  they're always going to win  they're always going to win  because they would do this  and then I would go  first of all Teller's not here  and why are you holding your hand out  to be quiet  and then I would feel like  you know I've kind of won this round  then they'd go  ho ho  busted me too  what a debunker  then you kind of go  okay I'm still dirty  you know you just  you can't win  but they would do it over  and over again  it would be all the time 
[01:10:30]  I get a great idea in the shower  let's have Teller not talk  so you can do that if you want  but be careful  because I might forget  that he hasn't talked  for 33 years  hey I gotta get this in  yeah we'll start with you  oh wow only two minutes before  yeah someone's gonna win a thousand dollars  for that  after the break more with Penn Jillette  big fans of the BS show there  oh thank you  can't say it on the radio  but it's a great show on Showtime  well thank you  you gotta get your  your angle on David Copperfield  we're having a lot of fun with him 
[01:11:00]  yeah well my  you know my  my friend talked about it a lot  in the Inquirer  but I  I love  I love how he just  she spilled the beans a lot on that  I'm sorry but  whisks girls off to rape island  that's wonderful  let's get into that  more with Dane Cook  very busy show  it's Opie and Anthony  hey we got a busy one today  it's Opie and Anthony  want to congratulate Sean  he's from Indiana  I don't know what radio station  screw Sean  I wanna hear this conversation  I know really fast  holy Jesus 
[01:11:30]  I just want the people to stop calling  Sean from Indiana  won the latest one thousand dollars  I don't know what station he's listening on  but he's listening to one of our affiliates  we're not on in Indiana  so he figured it out  no  alright we'll have the sound  you gotta listen for tomorrow  in a few minutes here I think  what was going on Anthony over there?  I don't know  a little discussion going on  oh you're talking about  me?  yeah Penn and Jimmy  disagreeing on  on everything  on everything  I was saying that Bill Donahue  you felt treated you well 
[01:12:00]  and I'm saying that  that's not all he should be judged on  I agree with you on that  but I didn't say he treated us well  I didn't say I'd love to hold him  I said I felt differently about him  after having spoken to him  and after hearing his rationale  after having spoken to him  compared to other special interest people  who are all the same  I felt differently about Donahue  I felt differently about Donahue  after having spoken to him  and he runs the Catholic League  for people that  I really don't know out there  and he was instrumental  in getting us fired  and for some reason  we kind of get along with him now  which I don't understand myself sometimes  and there's no motive for us  to get along with him 
[01:12:30]  because we started talking to him  not to get back on radio  long before we were on XM  and we had him call in  just to hate his guts  and to trash him for something else  he was taking a stand on  It's certainly true  that there are people  that you can have philosophical differences with  that you can lubricate socially with  you can get through  but I think that there are some moral problems with him  that you shouldn't forget  while you're getting along with him  while you're being nice  while you're stroking him  and so on  you should remember  you should remember certain things  Like what? 
[01:13:00]  I think that the things he said about Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Bill Maher  I think those are things that...  Well, look what Bill Maher said  I mean, what's the problem with him saying that?  Bill Maher was saying things about our soldiers  which is fine  I got no problem with Bill Maher saying that  so what's the problem?  No, no, but you're very...  It's very important that you point out  the differences you have with Bill Maher  and it's important you point out  the differences you have with Bill Donahue  As a matter of fact, anybody...  Which we have, by the way  Yeah  We have pointed out the differences  Yeah, that's all I'm saying  that was really my entire point  And then he makes us laugh  He goes, what do I know? 
[01:13:30]  I just drink a lot at an Irish bar  And then you have to laugh at that  and you're like, you forget that you don't like the guy  Yeah, but you're saying that we didn't point that out  which is how the relationship with him started  We certainly did point that out  We did talk about it  Oh good, then I'm wrong  Okay  Really?  No  Somehow  I was just going from what you said right here  I didn't hear the whole other conversation  Yeah, we've had many conversations  Yeah, no, that's good  As long as you're still pointing that out  and not turning around entirely  I have no problem with it  There's no problem with being a nice guy  We had him on our show  You know?  And he was 
[01:14:00]  I was not there during the shoot  but the crew didn't say  You know, he threw things at them  and treated him terribly  I imagine I'd get along with him fine  We do have moral differences  He points them out and so will I  Yeah  Yeah, that's all  I think also  you two were discussing the  you can't really determine somebody  just by how they treat you  Well that becomes more and more important  when you have the power of the microphone  people will treat you better  because they know you might be on the radio  Yeah  Tomorrow too 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, but they'll also  they'll also treat you worse  if they know they're being heard  I mean, you know, it's  Sure, sure  I judge people basically  on how they treat me  and how I deal with them  because that's what my experience is with them  I mean, and then you raise the point of  well, Manson didn't do anything to you  and it's like, oh, of course  I mean, that's  I only said Manson because I didn't want to go to Hitler yet  That was the only reason  I thought maybe I could wait three minutes to go to Hitler  Can I bring up a great point as far as Jimmy, you know, how people treat him  He was a huge Yankee fan 
[01:15:00]  and Dirk Jeter blew him off for a picture  He absolutely despises the Yankees now  And using your philosophy, Dirk Jeter has done a lot of charity  and you gotta look at his body of work  and he seems like a pretty good guy in general  But because Jimmy got blown off for a picture  now he absolutely hates the Yankees  Yes, I'm 39 years old  and I'm reacting like a baby  I was very upset  but I did acknowledge the guy does a tremendous amount of charity work  he's the best shortstop for the Yankees  I understand all that  but to me, he was a dick  so I hate his guts  I think this show is becoming much too well-rounded 
[01:15:30]  I don't think you can really get anybody listening  when you kind of go  Well, I see both sides of everything  Well, he's not a bad guy  No, I'm amazed  I'm amazed to this day that, you know, Jimmy hates the Yankees  just because Dirk Jeter blew him off for a picture  And the rest of the guys I met I didn't like either though  None of them were really cool that night  I mean, none of them were  You know who was? Giambi  He was the only one that you could teach  He was kind of a douche  They were all aloof and kind of douche  Yeah, you're making a very big mistake here  You're making eye contact with me while talking sports 
[01:16:00]  which means that I kind of get a nod  and act like I know things guys know  I'm terrible about that  I mean, anything kind of  But you must have played basketball back in here  I never watched a sporting event  Why?  I just never gotten around to it  I know they're wonderful and people love them  It's just, it never happened  You never got into sports at all?  Never, isn't that horrible?  That's terrible  So when he's looking at me like I'm supposed to recognize  the names of people on baseball teams  I just feel like I'm lying to him  So you don't even know who Dirk Jeter is?  Well I do, I do know that he's a famous person that plays sport 
[01:16:30]  Do I give any credit for that at all?  And I've got it from context that it's baseball and Yankees  I've gotten all that  So while you were growing up everyone else was like playing sports  and looking at sporting events on TV  What were you doing?  It's horrible stuff, reading, stuff like that  Reading up on Harry Houdini  I was the biggest outcast possible in that way  I mean, you wouldn't have  You might have liked me even less then  Well, I don't dislike you now  But I read and played sports 
[01:17:00]  I didn't just watch sports all day and then loop it  No, I wasn't saying anything bad about it  I was very careful  I was very careful to not say anything about sports love people  I'm saying, it's like you can do both, you know  You can do both, yes, I'm sure  I'm not saying I'm the most well-read gentleman  But I mean, I don't think I watched baseball and had Down syndrome  No, I didn't say that  I didn't say that, I was nothing  I was saying it was a total inadequacy on my part  I mean, I know that Richard Feynman played third base for a very famous team  I don't know who that is 
[01:17:30]  Okay, me neither  No clue  It's Penn Jillette, of course, from his show on Showtime  I was more into my microscopes and telescopes as a kid than sports  I didn't play sports  Did you watch sports?  No  You didn't have a team growing up?  No  Like my father took me to a jet game or something like that  But, and it was at Shea Stadium  Let me date myself  My brother had a Farrah Fawcett poster I stared at for about three years  Yeah  So I tapped out from 14, 15, and 16 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, like sports took a backseat to everything  Girls  It was girls, it was just, yeah  Anything, and then smoking pot  Once I started smoking a little bit of pot in my adolescence  Thank you, Joe  My brother had to hide  I was into model rocketry and everything  And he had to hide his pot in my model rockets  So I found a joint and decided, let me see what this is all about  And smoked it  And that pretty much took care of about eight years of my life 
[01:18:30]  That took care of eight  A fog  That took care of eight hobbies  Yeah, that was it  No more hobbies than that  No sports, no nothing  Just, I need more pot  I gotta get my weed  Ugh  I was trying to invent more ways to masturbate  I was like, really like  I think the furthest I went was right into a Prell bottle  Jeez  That'll sting ya  That'll sting  You gotta watch  You do live and learn 
[01:19:00]  Hey, David Copperfield  We gotta ask you about him there, Penn  Yeah, never raped me  We spent time together  Never raped me  He was always a gentleman  Never had to force himself on me  That's all I can tell you  I was willing in everything I did with David  I went and saw his show in Vegas the last time we had to do some stuff out there  I hated it  Yeah  It was so freaking hacky  I'm like, is this guy gonna update his stuff or what?  Doesn't have to  I haven't seen his show in years  He's selling out still every, sure, every day 
[01:19:30]  I don't believe that's literally true, but he's doing well  He's doing well  He's selling out every show  I'll tell you why  I think it was the MGM, whatever hotel Copperfield was in  And they said, a prime seat just released  Yeah  When that sign is made  Oh really?  Yeah, but it was a made sign, they didn't just jot it down  But you got all these new guys that have really updated the whole presentation  Yeah  And he's still doing the same stuff that he was doing in the 80s  What?  Oh, Dane's gotta leave for a while  I'm gonna split for a few  Alright, Dane Cook is doing some phoners for other radio shows or something  And Bob Kelly's here  Wow, this is a crazy day  He's a busy guy  Of course, Bob's here 
[01:20:00]  Dane will be joining the show in a little bit  Why didn't they hold up a note instead of Dane saying, I'm gonna leave now?  Well, cause he didn't know he had to leave  Oh, okay  Yeah, cause then it looks like he's not approving of what we're talking about  And just leaving  Probably isn't  Cause that has happened in the past too with some of our guests  No, he's just leaving to do other things  He's that busy  That's good though, now I can turn around without having my back to Dane  Yeah, you were in an awkward position  Yeah, it was weird  I'm kinda in between  The studio's not set up for more than one guest  I don't know  Well, get used to it, cause you guys are super stupid  There'll be like 15 guests at a time now 
[01:20:30]  Well, today  Jesus Christ  When it rains and pours, we guess  What do you think of the new breed of young magicians out there?  I don't know  Well, I like Chris  You know, we know Chris forever  And I guess that's  When you talk about the new breed of magicians that are out there  You're talking about one guy  Yeah  It's not like there's like 500 cool magicians  There's like zero  You know, there's like one guy  And you know, Chris Angel is the coolest and the best looking 
[01:21:00]  In a pool that includes me, Teller, Copperfield, Siegfried and Roy  You're the best looking and the hippest in that group  I don't think you're saying Jack  Yeah, he's getting action as a magician  I suppose  Yeah  He's a good guy  Yeah, we've had him on the show a couple of times  There's nothing you can say bad about Chris  He's a good guy  And he's really nice  And he's really hard working  We like his stuff  And he's been around forever  You know what though?  Until I hear your opinion on people  I just don't know what to think  You can't tell  It's either  You know, that guy's cool 
[01:21:30]  So now I know he's cool with you  But there are some people that are like  Oh, this son of a bitch  Let me tell you exactly how he does every trick  Well, sometimes  Yeah  How do you determine like  Whose spot you're gonna blow up  It's how baseball players treat me  Really?  That's how I make all my decisions basically  If they'll sign the picture  I love Chris H. I went up to him and asked him for an autograph  And he was kind and sweet  And signed it  So now I'm a Yankees fan forever  Oh good  So now you're not gonna tell us 
[01:22:00]  How he moved that tree in Vegas, right?  Oh, he moved a tree in Vegas?  Yeah  I haven't watched all the programs I should've  Yeah, he didn't look like a real tree  Would you say he's the most creative guy?  Like, cause you guys have a whole  Like, you guys look at each other  Probably the way comedians look at each other  Is there like  Who do you think is the most creative guy in the field right now?  You know, there really hasn't been  David Blaine's first special, Street Magic  Changed the entire way Magic was done  Because he pointed the camera at the people watching it  And no one had thought of that before  And it was absolutely brilliant 
[01:22:30]  So his magic, you know  And it's so hard to say this stuff without sounding snotty  I'm just trying to tell you the truth  His magic did not change very much  But his way of presenting it changed the entire world  It's the best magic special ever done  Was Street Magic by David Blaine  Not because of what he did  But because of the way they shot it  Which changed everything  And it just absolutely blew our minds  And then Chris has kind of taken that point of view  Of how to do that stuff  And just done it a lot more  He's just much more prolific than David Blaine 
[01:23:00]  And I think perhaps a little easier going  So he can get more done  So that whole style of having the magic  Not matter whether you're using camera tricks  Not matter how you're doing it  But just matter how excited the people are  Is a huge change  And one that we've never done  We've never really moved into that  His publicity stunts suck though man  Come on  Chris or Chris or David Blaine  David Blaine  Well yeah of course  And I don't understand that  I was very clear  One special he did  He did great 
[01:23:30]  But every year this city here  You know New York obviously  Let's him do another dumb thing  That is like  Who gives a crap  Yeah  He also  He started doing this thing  Which I  I mean I'm  I'm making this up  I don't know that it's true  But he started announcing stunts  That he doesn't do  Like  And then I guess he's hoping  That we'll think  That he did it  Like he's announced  He was gonna jump out of an airplane  Yeah  At a higher height than ever  He announced he was gonna hold his breath  Longer than ever  Didn't do either of those things  And the last thing  You can find this on the web 
[01:24:00]  If you look  He announced he was gonna live  Alone with wild animals  I read that one  And  I love the fact that he stressed  It was alone  And then  Never really talked about  How we were gonna know about it  You know  Cause I think that's like  The hippest  Kind of  Performance art  You know  As absolutely cool as possible  If David Blaine just went  Without anybody seeing it  Yeah  Or taping it or anything  To live with wild animals  Cause that worked so well for Roy  It's  It's kinda brilliant though  Yeah 
[01:24:30]  It really is cool  If he does it that way  It's real him  I think we gotta like  Start doing that  Just start talking about  The things we're gonna do  Yeah and he's done that  There's a few others  I can't think of  That's pretty funny  I thought it was really cool  He just kind of announces it  Then you know  People go  You couldn't possibly do that  I guess he goes home  And goes  Oh yeah I guess if I fall on an airplane  I'll break myself  Do you ever see  Anything  A trick or illusion  That you don't know how it's done  Yeah that happens once in a while  Yeah  Does it just piss you off  And go  Does it bug you 
[01:25:00]  Do you sit there toiling  Not at all  What's most interesting was  I was  My wife was watching  Criss Angel's show  And I was walking through  And I hadn't seen any of the trick  And I had no idea what the set up was  Or anything  And my wife's watching  She's like  She's going  This is amazing  And I turned  And I saw the screen  For I think  Four seconds  Five seconds  And I went  Twins  And I heard my wife going  Oh  Oh it's just 
[01:25:30]  It's just  Twins  It's just  Twins  It's just  Wreck it  And she was kind of bummed  That was the last time she watched me  That stuff pisses me off  Cause when you find out how the trick's done  And you're like  It was that simple  Cause you're racking your brain  And  Well you know the thing is  Many many many of the tricks aren't that simple  You know there's very few  You can walk through and say  You know 45 degree angle mirror  But when you can  It's really funny  What I like about magic  Is trying to figure out how it's done  I'm a big fan of that 
[01:26:00]  And  Fast Eddie's a magician friend of mine  He does  He does close up right  He does a lot of really  His  His hands  His hands are just amazing  With the stuff he can do  Magic is a goofy feel  Because the really cool stuff  All happens in close up  It's amazing  Yeah  What some of these guys could do close up  Like how did  Turn the dollar bill into a hundred  Right in front of my eyes  But I  I blow up everyone's spot  Cause I need to know how it's done  And people get mad  Why would you do that  It's like cause that's what  Is interesting to me 
[01:26:30]  Is to try to figure out how this  Is actually done  That is the huge  That is the huge difference  That  That we  That we have in magic  And other people don't  You know  Copperfield and Henning  More Henning started at Doug Henning  Was this  Put away your disbelief  Put away your skepticism  Just come on a magic journey with me  If you're doing that  Then it's just special effects  You know  The idea of magic  Is not willing  The willing suspension of disbelief  It's the unwilling  Suspension  And so we love people 
[01:27:00]  That come to our show  With a chip on their shoulder  We want them to know  It's a trick  You know  The people that walk the line  And go  Maybe it's a trick  Maybe it's not  What do we know  Who  I just find that stuff  To be intellectually uninteresting  Because we know  You're lying  You know  You know it right away  How stupid do you think we are  So the idea that  That Teller had really  You know 30 years ago  About magic  Was the idea  You could say to the audience  You know we're doing tricks  We know we're doing tricks  Let's do tricks  You know 
[01:27:30]  And we give some of them away  And some of them we don't  Well the ones you give away  It's interesting  Because a lot of times  Like Ope said  A trick is given away  And you just kind of go  Huh  Yeah  Like that  But you guys do it in a way  Where it's really fun  One of the best ones I've seen  Was when you guys did the  I guess Teller was in a little  Little cube spot  And his hand is coming up  At one in his head  It's called lift off to love  That we did for a long time  Yeah  And that was really tough  Because we had to invent the trick 
[01:28:00]  And then show how it was done  The problem is  A lot of work in that one  Most of the  That was stupid  You know  The amount of work we put in  Per minute on stage  You know  If we had talent  You know  We wouldn't have to do  You know  We're working  We got this new sawing we're doing  Where we're going to saw a woman  I guess I'm giving it away  It doesn't matter  We're going to saw a woman in half  And show exactly how it's done  And where she's hidden  And the exact apartment  And everything  And then saw that part in half  And so it means 
[01:28:30]  And then it's going to get  Really bloody and gory and awful  So it's just like  You bring the saw down to here  This is how it's done  She's hiding right here  See here's her body  Here's where the mirrors are  Here's where the whole thing is  And  All the way through  And blood everywhere  So we have to kind of  Sort of hide her twice  You know  Yeah  We've been working on this thing  For  It's going on two years now  Working on it all the time  With you guys playing in the background  In our shop  You know  The shop guys 
[01:29:00]  At this huge warehouse in Vegas  You guys show us blaring  Oh that's pretty cool  All the time  Wow  And they're in there you know  Trying to find how you make this torso bleed  Just right when the saw hits it  That's what  So some people are doing other work  While they're listening to you  That's a great job to have  Well you guys pull it off  You guys pull it off  And it's going to be  Four minutes of stage time  Four minutes  And we'll be putting in like  Two and a half years  Yeah  Wow  It's just stupid  Is it just basic principles  A lot of these tricks  That are basic principles  That you just kind of rework to 
[01:29:30]  There's a great thing that  Jim Steinmeier said  Who developed a lot of  Illusions for Copperfield  And so on  And he's a great guy  Jim Steinman said  Magicians are all guarding  A safe that's empty  There are no secrets  People will come to us  Like corporate shows  And go  We want to pay you  A few hundred thousand dollars  What you're going to do  Is make a car disappear  In the middle of a room  And we go  There are no rules of physics  That we know that you don't  We're going to have to cheat  Lie  We're going to put something 
[01:30:00]  In front of it  And there's going to be smoke  And it's going to look cheesy  Because you can't just disappear  And they go  Well there's things that you know  And we go  No no  Not outside of physics  Right  If you were outside of physics  We'd be in a different field  We'd be in the Department of Defense  We'd be Nobel Prize  We'd be somewhere  We wouldn't be on stage  At our show in Vegas  We wouldn't have a theater  There's no you know  There's no Einstein theater in Vegas  Smart people don't have theaters there  So we're trying to do  The one thing that we know  That you might not know 
[01:30:30]  Is there are probably 50 dead ends  You would go down  That we wouldn't go down  Because we've been there  That's the only difference  But if you guys said  You know  We really want to saw a woman in half  Show how it's done  And then saw it in half further  You'd sit down  And you'd say  Okay so it's got to look like her body's here  We've got to hide her body somewhere else  Where is it going to be  You want to try using like a half woman  No you know  Chris did that  And it showed up on YouTube  Everybody knows it  We want to try  We'll use a full woman 
[01:31:00]  If she's a contortionist  Does that mean we can get her in this box  Oh wait  It looks like she's in that box  We can't do that  And that's all you do  You just bang your head against the wall  To cash it out  And you read everything other people have done  And you say  Oh you know  There's this thing that  That Harbin did in England  Where he used  It turns out  You can make it look like  If she turns sideways  People don't register it  And you know  Little things like  We put black lines on the side  And put stuff that's coming  A flying wedge toward you  It'll look a little thinner 
[01:31:30]  But you know that stuff  And then you just sit  Like an idiot  With five guys in a room  With a box at the other end of the room  Going  That wouldn't fool me  And there's a lot of magicians  Who do this thing where they go  That wouldn't fool me  But it'll fool the idiots  Who come to our show  And those are the guys  That have sucky shows  I think you're downplaying it a little bit  The comedy that's involved in your shows  Really cuts through  And it really makes it very entertaining 
[01:32:00]  Yeah well thank you  There's a lot of guys  That could do your angle  As far as this goes  And pull it off  Because you've got to have  A sense of humor  As you're showing people  How this stuff is done  Yeah and also  If you're going to give away  Five tricks during the night  You've got to have another five  That will fool them  For the rest of their lives  Right  If you're going to give stuff away  That they already figure out  It's going to appear to be  A little bit smart  Yeah that's a nice twist too  Because then you blow their minds  With something like  Whoa  Yeah we end our show  With a trick  Sure  I think the bullet catch 
[01:32:30]  Yeah that is amazing  Your guy is  I saw that in Boston  Your guy is giving us the look  Is he?  Is he?  So he's holding up a piece of paper  He's giving the look like  I just got to ask you one thing  Did you see The Prestige the movie?  I didn't see it  You didn't see that one?  Because I saw the other one  The Illusionist  Yeah I didn't like it at all  That one sucked  I liked The Prestige though  That was pretty good  Yeah yeah yeah  Teller read the book  And I remember when  It was Hugh Jackman in there right?  Yeah yeah  And he came  I was telling him  From the bottom of my heart  That I was going to run and see it  Because he came to see our show 
[01:33:00]  And we talked  And I talked about how excited  He was about the movie  Yeah there's great little twists in there  Didn't even bother crossing the street  To see it  Because I'm a liar  And out of my basement  I run a league  That you should be able to do  And I'll sign anything you want  Jimmy anytime  That's all I can  Whip it out right now  I'll sign it with a felt marker  I'm sorry  And there's no line  I'll draw with you  No it sucks  You got to go  And we really want to talk about  The fifth season of  B.S.  B.S.  But that's already been on  It's the sixth season we're working on  Isn't that cool?  Oh okay  Wow 
[01:33:30]  Six seasons of that?  How did that happen?  Really?  You know you're my  I don't know if this is a compliment  But you're my go to show  When there's like nothing on TV  I go to showtime  And then I go to on demand  Oh thanks so much  When there's nothing on  I don't mean it like that though  But  I believe that there's no greater compliment  Than saying I had nothing better to do  In the whole world I had nothing better to do  I called you  It's a terrific compliment  I'm going to twist it that way  I'm going to be fine with it  Showtime on demand  I'm serious  I'm working on liking you guys  Because my crew will disown me 
[01:34:00]  If they  When they listen to this  If I have said one thing  That pisses you off in any way  The crew is going to walk  I haven't  And this is a case of a boycott  That really matters  Saw your own stupid whore in half  You paint the god damn box  I'm out of here  You show disrespect to Anthony  I knew something was up  Because I have a feeling  You're in a tough situation  I think you really want to go after us  For some things  But you're like  My crew is going to hate me forever  The crew has all the power in the world  If they decide 
[01:34:30]  Tonight  You know  The next time I'm on stage  They can just decide  And I die  And there's no exaggeration to that  They can just say  Give me his gun  Oh man  Let's monkey with that  Oops  Sorry  They might have a voicemail or two from you  That they're ready to release  I saw you do that in Boston  The bullet catch  And I was obviously amazed  It's  There's no way  Anyone just sitting there  The layman if you will  Can just sit there  And watch that 
[01:35:00]  And go  It's anything different  Than him being shot in the face  Yeah you know  We worked really hard on that  And got a lot of help from  It's one of the rare tricks  That somebody came to us  And gave us stuff that was too smart  That we couldn't do  And it's indeed dangerous  Yeah yeah  Well you know  It is the most dangerous trick in show business  Because 13 people have died on stage doing it  The way they usually say it in magic books  Is they usually say like 12 magicians and 3 carnies  They put them in different categories  But my favorite one who died doing this 
[01:35:30]  And this is important  Is one guy came out on stage to start his show  The end of his show  It was a 19th century Wild West magician  Came out called Willard the Wizard I believe  Came out on stage to do his medicine show  And he ended with the bullet catch  And he knew that and did the advance press  And came out and started his show  And the guy in the audience stood up and said  Catch this  And shot him in the face  Wow  So I was walking through LAX you know 
[01:36:00]  And I'd forgotten for a moment I was walking through LAX  I thought I was just walking because I'm in my own little world  Yeah  And a bunch of youths as you'd call  Were over to one side and they went  Yo Pat you can catch bullets  And I turned around and went  Trick  It's a trick  It's a trick  It's just a trick  And then realized I was in LAX  And went  Oh yeah  Anytime you want  Anytime you want  Cause that is you know  That is the fear  Yeah 
[01:36:30]  I don't want that blurred line  No not with that  Especially  You know  Don't tell people you can really do this stuff Chris  Cause somebody might believe you  You know  Most people  Out of the 300 million people on the planet  On the United States  300 million aren't going to believe you  They're just going to think  Oh here's a guy who wanted to be in a hair metal band  That learned a card trick  That's all they're going to think  Who wears a cross around his neck big enough  To actually use to kill a joke  He carries three nails in his pocket  He's ready  If Christ comes back  Chris is ready  Somebody might not think you're just that guy 
[01:37:00]  They might actually think you have powers  And go  Hey Chris  Let me try putting you in a wood chipper  You know  Yeah  So with the gun thing  Very clear  Because I'm very aware of your demographic  Sure  I do tricks  I cannot catch bullets  If you shoot me  You will go to jail  Has that been clear enough?  That's pretty clear  But I'm going to go  Are they really getting crazy?  Yeah where are you going next?  I'm going on this morning television show  Michael and  Mike and Juliet  Yeah  Yuck 
[01:37:30]  Is it bad?  I've never seen this  It's a Regis rip off  Oh is it?  Yeah  Alright  We're going to do a thing on there  Just so you know  I'm going to force the three of clubs  And then it's going to be on Teller's eyes  We've got these scleral shells that go over his eyes and obliterate them  One says three, one says clubs  We're going to put our pajamas on, pretend we're asleep  For those of you who really care about magic  I know you have real fans  It'll be a top slip force  Nate who listens to the show all the time  We'll load the three of clubs on top of the deck 
[01:38:00]  I'll turn to the meat puppet  I'll riffle down the deck  I'll riffle down the deck and I'll say say stop  They'll say stop wherever they want  I'll break the cards very honestly, very openly  But I'll actually slip the top card off of my middle finger  It'll go on the top  Meat puppet will show it to the thing  Teller will have his eyes closed the whole time  He'll turn, open his eyes  He'll go  It's because we've actually changed his iris into the three of clubs  As opposed to little pieces of plastics that were ripped  You know this is where ophthalmology and magic meet 
[01:38:30]  On the Michelle and Robert show  Coming up soon  But don't stop listening to this one  What time is that?  It's now, I think I'm on now  I think Teller's like really screwed  You better go, alright  That would be some trick  He leaves through that door and he's instantly on the TV show  Hey Penn, we've just touched the surface with you  You gotta come back and see us again, alright?  Yeah  It's Penn Jillette  Absolutely  Don't forget to check out BS on Showtime  Thank you so much  Penn, you're great man  Thank you man  You wanna come back anytime  Yeah, we definitely got one to talk about 
[01:39:00]  He's leaving  It's Opie and Anthony  We're gonna take a break  Bob Kelly's here too  Coming back in studio  Bob Kelly's here  It's a very busy show  Opie and Anthony  Ooh  It's Opie and Anthony  Man, that Penn Jillette  What an ass  I don't say that  No, I like Penn Jillette  I ran out  I got a picture with him  I said, please come back  And he just gave away the magic trick  He's doing on TV in a little while 
[01:39:30]  That was pretty damn funny  Alright, here's the reset  We got Dane Cook in another studio  Doing other phone interviews  For other radio shows, I think  Yes  Or other media outlets  We got Bob Kelly in studio  Bobby  Yo  When's Dane coming back?  He got him in about half an hour  Okay  He'll finish this side of the show up with us  Dane Cook, of course  Just promoting all sorts of stuff  Movies and garden dates 
[01:40:00]  As in Madison Square Garden  And as in the old Boston Garden  I gave up trying to figure out what they named that place  I think it's the garden now  Nah  Whatever  It's the old Boston garden  That's what I like to say  It stinks  Alright  Hey, we need a sound for tomorrow  For the thousand dollar contest  You got one in?  E sound, huh?  Yes, we do  Here it is  Here it is  Alright, there you go 
[01:40:30]  That's it  That's the sound for tomorrow  You're listening for  Between 7 and 7.30  If you want to win a thousand dollars  And for the faithful listeners here  If you missed the sound  You can always go to onaradio.com  And get the next sound you're listening for  For a thousand dollars, okay?  And that's a good sound clip to play  Because we have officially started Povember  Yes  We don't know what we're doing with Povember  But the E-Rock-Tober thing  Was such a hit  We decided to continue with Povember 
[01:41:00]  I'll tell you what we're doing with Povember  We're celebrating a retard  Oh my god  Yeah, that's a lethal combination  He could kill you with like a pixie stick  We were all standing out on the sidewalk yesterday  And the fabulous Mr. Bennington  Comes and just walks down and owns the sidewalk  And when he stops  Pove came walking up and he goes  Oh, here comes the Matrix  He had the sunglasses on and the long leather  Here comes the Matrix 
[01:41:30]  We have to celebrate Pove  It's a celebration of Pove for a month  Hey, this is Master Poe  Poe, Poe, Boo, Boe, Banana, Nana  Banana, Fanna, Fofo, Fee, Fi, Momo  Poe!  There you go  Just a taste of Master Poe  Hey, but E-Rock-Tober ended in grand fashion  Almost tragedy 
[01:42:00]  Can we play those clips from yesterday?  Are they short?  Kind of short  What do you got?  Alright, yeah, we can get through this  So, the month of October was E-Rock-Tober  And yesterday, I guess we need to set this up  We went over to XM  And just...  What's her name again?  What's that ho his name?  Justine Jolie  Justine Jolie came by to say hi  You might remember the last time Justine Jolie was in studio  It was in this studio over here  And we asked her if we could spank her 
[01:42:30]  And E-Rock walloped her  He gave her the old Jake LaMotta  We actually got the clip  We played the wrong clip earlier for the people that linger longer  They were all over us for that  Oh, I know  But here's E-Rock spanking Justine Jolie right here in this studio  And leaving a massive, horrific handprint  Huge  On her bottom  Ow  Oh, that's all it is?  Oh, we don't have the part where she starts cursing you out?  We haven't beefed you  Oh, it's not beef 
[01:43:00]  The amount of beefs  That sounded fake  What an ashy  That is real, man  Ow!  Oh!  Ow!  And then it's...  Right after that, she's like...  You mother-effer!  Yeah, she got...  I just lost her mind  Very angry  Look how red...  It's a perfect, fat little hand imprint  It looks like a giant lip print  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Yeah, and then it got really, really ugly  And she just cursed at E-Rock  And we...  I was hiding  I was laughing so hard 
[01:43:30]  I was giggling  And I was on the floor  Trying to...  Trying to make sure my laughs were not heard on the radio  It was just one of those moments  Compare it to the other one, Ethan  That was another spank he did to a girl  Dude, listen to that  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  The second one  That's a punch in the face  That's what it sounds like  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Alright, hold on, hold on, man  No!  F you, man  I think I have the better one  Ah! 
[01:44:00]  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  It just...  Alright, let's go  Alright, ready?  Let's go back and forth now  Real fast  Alright  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Oh! 
[01:44:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  You're listening to E-Rock's greatest hit  That's right  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Wow!  Anyway...  That's a boy who loves his mother  Wow!  So, yesterday, the end of E-Rocktober, she just happened to be in studio with some penthouse pets 
[01:45:00]  and they did a lot of fun stuff for us  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well that it didn't go very well  Ha!  Ah! 
[01:45:30]  That's obviously platoon  Uh!  Yes!  Now, that's not the big toothed  guy  No, no, that was the woman and the husband  Yes, I understood she was upset  Yes!  But she should have shut up  Yeah, onclam up  You have to realize in that situation that Tom Baringer is not happy  Look into Tom Baringer's eyes and realize what's gonna happen if you don't clam up  Shane in the Bronx is saying that the slaps are identical, the actual slaps.  The reaction's slightly different, but the slaps are identical. 
[01:46:00]  So Justine Jolie was in yesterday, okay, and we're like,  hey, E-Rock, why don't you come in studio and say hi to Justine Jolie?  The setup goes after the famous...  Ah! Oh! Ow!  E-Rock also kind of sucked mayo off her toes.  Kind of. He did.  And that got him in a lot of trouble with his fiancée.  A lot of trouble.  And he got a talking to, which was basically,  I don't want you ever to be in the same studio as her.  I don't want you to ever talk to her.  I don't want you to acknowledge that she even exists on this earth. 
[01:46:30]  So yesterday, E-Rock came into the studio and was face-to-face with Justine Jolie,  the girl that his fiancée has a huge problem with,  to the point where E-Rock even said she would come over here and start a fight.  So it was very uncomfortable.  Like, E-Rock, take a look at her. Say hi.  And he would not look.  He stared straight ahead.  And every time Justine Jolie tried to go toward E-Rock,  E-Rock moved away like they were like two magnets that couldn't attach, right? 
[01:47:00]  So then we got the bright idea that E-Rock needed to call his fiancée live on the air,  two feet from Justine Jolie.  And this is how it went down, right?  Is that a good enough setup?  I think so.  Let's go to the tape.  All right.  E-Rock's calling his chick live on the show right now.  Look at her.  Wait, wait, here it is.  How are you doing?  You listening to the show?  No, don't put it on for the office. 
[01:47:30]  Put it on for the office.  Just tell her.  We have a guest here.  You might remember her.  Bitch.  All right.  Remember who you told me not to have any more involvement with?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, she's standing right next to me.  Wait, wait, wait.  I heard no kiss.  So I wanted to give you a heads up before you got any calls that I told you  that she's standing here pretty much naked next to me in the studio. 
[01:48:00]  No, don't hang out.  Uh-oh.  Twitch list.  What's she saying?  She's not saying anything.  You're a ring being flushed.  Hello?  Is she there?  Yeah.  So, uh, you okay with that? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, that sounded really okay.  Yep.  What's she saying?  Did she say yep or no?  She said no.  She's not okay with that at all.  Ask her why.  Ask her why.  They want to know why.  F***.  Oh.  A f***?  Whore.  Yeah, what did she say?  She said because she's a f*** whore and I don't want you near her.  Oh.  Oh, man.  So it was really uncomfortable.  Yeah, that was yesterday.  Oof. 
[01:49:00]  And then, uh, I guess the setup here is the phone call just continued?  I guess so.  All right, here we go.  It got worse.  More tape.  We're almost to the moment where it got really uncomfortable for everybody.  Really bad for everyone.  But first, more of the phone call.  Is there some crying going on?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  It's not looking good, guys.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  You okay, Iraq?  He's, uh, I apologize to, uh, Iraq.  He, as I zoom in, got a tight shot on his head. 
[01:49:30]  Let's go for the tight shot.  Iraq is having a conversation in a corner of the studio.  I hear a lot of okays going on.  Okay?  He's really taking charge.  All right.  I hear shenanigans and tomfoolery.  It's going to be bad.  Iraq?  Iraq.  Uh-oh.  Iraq.  All right.  The phone hung up.  He's got a mic in his hand.  He's slowly putting the phone away.  And he, he, he will, he's trying to compose himself before he turns back around. 
[01:50:00]  Iraq?  Iraq.  What happened?  Grab a mic and let us know what happened.  What happened?  Well, that could have gone better.  Um.  Turn around.  Look at the girl.  Yeah, what happened?  Are you not looking at us because you're tearing up?  Not all that, and I'm not allowed to, so, um.  All right, we're back live.  So, obviously.  Let me just tell people, too, people who did listen, this was on the XM side. 
[01:50:30]  Twitchels, is that noise you hear?  Yeah.  Oh.  Constantly.  That should be decapitated noise you hear.  I thought it sounds like he was starting to cry.  That was, that was true.  Yeah.  No, well, he was crying.  You heard it spoke up in his voice.  Yeah, that was the second half of the conversation.  Like, uh, he, he went off mic because she was giving him, uh, talking to, and he went  off, uh, to a, a corner in the studio, and he had his, uh, his face turned, so we  couldn't see, but it was obvious he was, uh, he was balling.  Yeah, he was like Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People.  Yeah, he was, he was balling. 
[01:51:00]  Why was he crying?  Well, she was giving him a talking to.  We're going to find out in a minute here.  A talking to him.  And then, uh.  Perhaps a bit more.  This is, this is the grand finale.  So then, of course, because we're such great friends, we decided in his moment of despair,  where we would play Everybody Hurts by R.E.I.M., and the phone call, uh, well, not the phone  call, but, uh, it continued with this.  Go ahead, Yorick.  Eric.  I can't do this.  What happened?  What'd you say?  We're not asking you to out, out, any real private stuff, but what'd you say to me? 
[01:51:30]  It's a fair question.  He can't.  He's in love with the girl, and he doesn't want to hurt her.  And now he feels he has, and he's leaving the studio.  Is that her fiance, his fiance?  Well, you're way to pick up on things.  Holy f***, you inept.  You know, not only is this idiot just twitching and bing through the entire podcast, but then  he asks a completely idiotic, are they opposite genders?  Shut up.  And at that point, Yorick said, I can't do it anymore, and he ran out of the studio. 
[01:52:00]  And Yorick.  And then he was gone for at least an hour.  Yorick and his girl talking reminded me that scene in Stripes, when they got caught doing  something wrong, and they tried to explain to John Larroquette, it was like, what happened?  Well, sir, we were on our way to bingo parlor.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yorick, you want to share what happened in that conversation?  Is it?  Yeah.  Huh?  No.  No?  That pretty much is, uh, speaks for itself.  No. 
[01:52:30]  She obviously said some really, really bad things that really got to you.  I would assume it had something to do with maybe the wedding's off or something, if  you continue with this.  I don't know.  I don't know for sure, but I think she laid down the law.  She's getting so emotional, yeah.  Because you're really in love with her, and you're going to marry this woman.  And she's a wonderful lady, by the way.  We all like her very much.  We like her.  She's far too good for you.  We kind of put her in a really awkward situation that, you know, E-Roc's calling her live on  the show while a naked stripper that she has a problem with is two feet from E-Roc. 
[01:53:00]  Right next to her.  Right.  It was awful.  That was the only way that was going to end.  So, Eric, basically, while you were talking, she was, you know, because, you know, she  has people that listen, and what was it that got you?  You don't even have to say what she said, but what was the vibe of it that got you so  much, that bothered you so much?  A lot of it was, well, some of it was what she was saying.  A lot of it was what she wasn't saying.  Oh, like, I love you?  That.  A lot of dead air on that end. 
[01:53:30]  Heavy breathing and stuff either being...  Having to learn anything from radio, dead air is really bad, even in private conversations.  You got to fill up that dead air with you.  You got to keep talking.  Keep that conversation going.  That's right.  Maybe you should have taken another phone call at that point or something.  No, no, no.  When you're fighting on the phone with your girl...  Sorry, guys.  No, that's right.  When it gets really quiet, I always do this, da-do-da-do.  That's comfy.  E-Rock, did you really get emotional? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I don't understand, by being yelled at, or was she saying emotional things to  you?  I mean, my girl yelling at me wouldn't make me cry.  Was she saying, like, you know, that...  Was she crying?  No, she was.  She was strong like bull.  No, she was, you know.  She was quite pissed off.  Derek's an emotional guy.  That's all.  He's a very...  That's good.  I like that about him.  I would love to be able to cry like that on cue.  You'd love to be able to cry once. 
[01:54:30]  On cue?  Bob Kelly cries when he sees the midgets and the...  That's true.  Getting...  Let's not forget, Bob Kelly does cry at some wimpy TV.  Displaced emotions.  He can't cry in real life, but it's stupid TV.  That's what it is.  Displaced emotions.  But a midget...  But I didn't know.  You just...  But a midget getting engaged gets the waterworks that are going with you.  Yeah, they look like little kids that are hurt.  So, what exactly was it, Iraq?  I don't know.  It was kind of difficult because it took so long for the previous incident to blow over. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, wow.  It did?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't talk about it much on the air, but that was an ugly, ugly thing that ended  up being a real problem in his personal life.  That's fair to say.  Yeah.  And so, this wasn't really...  Especially since she was...  Just got out of a meeting and everybody in the office was pretty much around her to  her end of the conversation.  So, that didn't really help while she was at work. 
[01:55:30]  And then she realized she was kind of on the radio, and I'm sure that wasn't...  Yeah, that wasn't.  ...pleasant for her, right?  Yeah.  No.  But that's how Iraqtober ended.  But everything is okay now.  We need the update.  Everything's all right?  Well, we'll see after...  At 9 o'clock when she gets up here.  Well, did she come in here?  Oh, no.  Wait, what did we do wrong today?  Just talking about it?  She just wants it to go away.  Well, it is povember, so we're done with it.  Yeah.  Well, you were a good boy.  You didn't do anything.  No, I know. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, that little rub on the ass was nothing.  I mean, it was...  You rubbed her on the ass?  No.  I'm kidding.  Help the guy out.  Look at her jumping in.  No.  I gotta help the guy out.  Eric was very well-behaved.  Yeah, he wanted nothing to do with it.  He's on very thin ice.  And I don't fault Justine either.  She didn't do anything wrong.  It was just a stupid radio thing.  If it's anything...  I told Iraq, truthfully, I got in a tremendous amount of hot water for spanking a girl on  the air.  And I tried to tell my girlfriend, it's like, it doesn't mean anything.  It really doesn't mean nothing.  You know what?  One of the best...  I got into a lot of trouble.  Dude, I got a prostate exam in a bathroom with a hot nurse two months before I was getting 
[01:56:30]  married.  Are you in trouble for that?  No, no.  Of course not.  Oh.  I'll take that crap.  I'd give a goon hand in two seconds.  Goon hand.  You should shut your face.  I do what I do.  Yeah.  That's what I say to her.  I do what I do.  Yeah.  Let's call her so you can say that.  Yeah.  Call her up.  I'll smack her on the air.  Yeah.  When you hear about how you goon hand her.  I'm going to call your bluff.  Give me your number.  I'm going to smack her.  Give me your number.  And I'm going to smack her dad.  And I'm going to smack her mom. 
[01:57:00]  I might even take her mom and soil her.  You know, it has to be pointed out, yesterday Jimmy had one of the funniest lines about his  girlfriend.  Like, we had penthouse pets in the studio.  Jesus, right.  And one was 19 and you were just out of your freaking mind.  You were foaming at the mouth.  I don't want to do your line because it was really funny.  I don't remember the line.  It was how you were going to go home and drag your girlfriend out of bed by her hair and  leave her in the hallway. 
[01:57:30]  I think I did it, Justin.  Thank you.  He was so into this penthouse pet.  You know, and he goes, I'm going home right after this show, grabbing her out of bed by  her hair and leaving her in the hallway.  Because there was another line I remember him saying that was similar to that, but he was  going to throw her out by the, and then he used a C word.  The toes.  Yes.  Oh, they're there.  The pictures Iraq is putting up of the.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Good luck finding those in this day and age radio. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  But that's four penthouse pets.  I don't see a watermark on it in their birthday suit.  It can't be real.  It's photoshopped.  All right.  We got to take a break.  So that's how Iraqtober ended, but it's, uh, it's all, it's all good as long as we stop  talking about it.  Right?  Yeah, we're pretty much good.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're getting close to playing.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  More with Bob Kelly.  I think Dane Cook's going to pop his head in to kind of, uh, wrap up, uh, this side of 
[01:58:30]  the show with us.  It was cool.  He came in for quite a while.  Yeah.  We'll get some plugs in and, uh, and that'll be it.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Dane Cook's somewhere in this joint doing his thing.  Hopefully he'll come in and say goodbye to everybody.  And then, uh, we got Bob Kelly in studio because, uh, Dane was in studio.  He said, Hey, Bob, why don't you come in and say hi to your friend there? 
[01:59:00]  I'm going to fight Dane as soon as he walks in.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm going to knock him right out.  He was talking about the wedding online.  Uh, he left me the funniest message.  Uh, just, I got to reset for people though.  Like our friend Bob Kelly, he went to Hawaii, he got married, uh, just him and his chick  basically.  Yeah.  But he had the whole thing on the internet and then he, uh, sent out e-vites.  What are they called?  E-vites or e-invite, whatever the hell it is.  E-vite.  And, uh, you were able to watch Bob Kelly get married on the internet as he's in this 
[01:59:30]  beautiful place called Hawaii in your, in your stupid basement living with your mom.  Right.  Yep.  Thanks, Bob.  I had, uh.  And, uh, Dane thought it was hilarious, especially when you let the butterflies loose.  Yeah, he left me a message.  It started out like, cause I was getting messages from, you know, calling and certain people,  you know, busting them.  And he, he called me.  He was like, man, I got to tell you the most amazing thing I've ever seen, bro.  You look great.  Dawn was beautiful.  What an amazing man.  I can't do this.  You corny loser. 
[02:00:00]  Butterflies.  Butterflies.  Butterflies.  Uh, I didn't know about the butterflies, to tell you the truth.  Who gave you the idea?  He actually misread his eyes.  He said butter cookies.  Oh, swim walk.  It was all, listen.  Who said butterflies?  Okay, ready?  This would be a good idea.  This is what I did.  I said, let's get married.  Yeah.  And then I said, go ahead, get on your computer.  I, whatever you want, we'll do.  And she picked everything.  Okay.  And I just said, okay.  Fair enough. 
[02:00:30]  I'm fair enough, sir.  I've seen the couple, uh, light a candle to have interviews.  Individual candles and light a bigger candle.  I've seen that.  My buddy got married in Atlanta, and, uh, they had, like, two different color, uh, sands  that they put, yeah, put, uh, in one jar.  Oh, Jesus.  His color and her color in one jar.  Like butterflies.  Uh-oh.  You won't see that happening at the dog's house.  I don't want that different colored sand mixing with our sand. 
[02:01:00]  And right on cue, here's Dane Cook to beat you up there.  There, Bob.  Hey, uh, Dane, just to fill you in, we're talking about Bob Kelly's wedding again, online.  All right, ready?  Here's my impersonation of Bobby.  Ready?  Do you love this woman forever?  Um, yeah.  Oh, were you doing that?  Well, I was mic'd.  I had a mic on.  I had a cordless mic.  You sounded like Darth Vader.  Yeah, but you breathe heavy when you're on our show, as well.  Yeah, I think I breathe heavy just because I'm fat. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I was telling Dane, because he was talking about the butterflies, that they were frozen,  right?  So they would stay alive a little longer?  They were frozen, and then it was like, I think it was like 85 out when we were on that  beach.  It was really hot.  Right.  So they went from, uh, being frozen to, uh, just being, you know, in a frying pan in  two seconds.  But you can freeze them, and they live?  Not freeze.  They're like in a fridge.  Just slow down their little butterfly heart until you need them.  Yeah.  Do that to flies. 
[02:02:00]  You put them in the, yeah, that's how, like, they do a magic trick where it makes it look  like a fly is dead.  You put it in your hand, because it won't do anything.  It'll just lay there.  And then it warms up in your hand, and then you open your hand up, and it flies away, and  you go, look, life, life, it lives.  That works with hookers, too, Jimmy.  Bobby, what was the, what was option, uh, uh, B?  What else, what other ideas were on tap besides the butterflies?  Yeah, like, what idea was there than that?  Galloping away on the back of a horse.  Yeah, what ideas did you say no to? 
[02:02:30]  On the back of the groom.  What ideas did you float into the ocean?  What did you say no to?  Seems like you didn't say no to anything.  Well, I didn't, I, I.  A rat.  A rat that you both, both built together out of.  Well, I said no to this.  Matching dresses.  It was, it was, she wanted, like, a total, uh, like, Hawaiian wedding, and I had him,  I had the guy out of, like, a little religion in it.  Hawaiian is a code word for gay.  Put a little religion in it? 
[02:03:00]  Well, yeah, like a little, a little Jesus here and there.  You know, my grandmother, my Catholic grandmother was watching, and I didn't want him speaking.  He was just Hawaiian.  I didn't.  You married in a church then, you stupid heretic.  No, dude, that's where the footprints in the sand were, dude.  Yeah, did you make two sets of footprints going to one?  And that's when Jesus said, my son, that's where I tried to pick you up, you fat bastard,  They thought you were too heavy.  I actually wrote, I put a heart in the sand and I wrote, I just got, we just got Maui'd 
[02:03:30]  and then the wave came up and took it away.  Is that true?  Is that true?  I just got Maui'd.  You know they are marketing that.  You know they market that.  There's probably t-shirts with that on it.  I didn't get to that part because they were.  I got Maui'd.  Popupforclassmates.com opened and I ended up clicking away from your wedding.  I wish someone pulled out a machine gun and Maui'd you down with it. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, your video's getting some hits too.  Dane, Bob was in recently.  Yes.  And on YouTube, if you go to Two Girls, One Cup Reaction, Robert Kelly, they're starting  to say it's the best reaction to that video.  Oh, it absolutely is.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  It's this horrific video.  It's in the porn genre, but it's...  No, it's not.  It's way sicker.  Not your video.  I'm talking the video you're watching. 
[02:04:30]  The porn, them, what they're doing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he says it's the grossest.  It's definitely in the porn genre, but it's twisted.  It's an extreme niche porn, usually reserved to Germans or Japanese pornographers.  Or bald guys with wiffles.  And the bit is, which is pretty funny, here's the thing, you can't really explain it on this  side, but just to give you a little taste, so to speak.  Taste is...  Here's the video that Bob was watching, okay?  Okay.  Starts off very nice with two girls doing some fun stuff. 
[02:05:00]  And then...  Oh, goodness gracious.  Then a cup is being filled up.  We can say that much.  Yeah.  And then they do that with the cup.  It looks like a frappuccino.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Almost delicious.  Yeah.  Almost.  Like a moosey beverage.  Yeah.  All right.  So...  All right.  Get rid of that video.  So, we play this for Bob, because you know by now he has a very weak stomach, right?  Yeah.  So, Bob...  This is Bob's reaction to that video you just saw.  Just a little...  Go to the beginning.  Go to the beginning.  So, this is Bob watching the video.  It's up on YouTube.  Two girls, one cup reaction. 
[02:05:30]  Robert Kelly.  He's seen the part where we all like the first part, which is very nice.  Two girls kind of doing their thing.  And then it turns horribly wrong, and watch what Bob does.  He just starts puking.  Of course.  And the vomiting started when the two girls were just kissing.  And the sound Bob makes is just...  He's gagging.  He's puking.  It's really funny.  And this is taking off on the internet where people are watching this video. 
[02:06:00]  I mean, you got that MySpace thing.  We got...  Yeah, only over two million friends.  But, no, what they're doing is people are filming themselves watching this horrific video  and now putting it online.  And we were not aware of that as we did this.  Then we were aware of it, and we brought it to other people's attention, but someone is  still giving me crap on instant feedback about it, but whatever.  That's for another day.  But that's Bob Kelly's reaction to that horrific video.  Love that.  I love your weak stomach.  Yeah.  Great.  Hey.  Remember the time, Bobby, I sent you the picture? 
[02:06:30]  Was that of the guy with the half the face?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that the guy that blew off his head?  And he's in the ER?  Yeah, he's...  With his face, like, kind of off his...  Yeah, I think so.  Well, there was two.  Remember that we were on tourgasm?  The guy told me...  I can't say it on this.  There's a motorcycle accident like that, too.  And the guy had scraped his face.  You can see where his mouth was because the teeth were in the bloody, pulpy face.  Oh, God.  And then there was that Mel Gibson movie that had a very inspirational ending. 
[02:07:00]  The Man Without a Face.  Remember that?  Certainly.  I liked how Bobby brought up tourgasm.  That's like a distant memory to him.  To me, too.  Yeah.  Ta-da.  Yeah, okay.  This is what I say to the middle act.  Make sure you say tourgasm.  And say starring in.  Don't say that cook's name.  That's what you say to the middle act.  In a mirror?  You might remember me from the tourgasm. 
[02:07:30]  Easy.  You're playing Red Lobsters.  Relax.  All right.  They don't all come out good.  Can I get a little car crash on that one?  Wow.  As you said, I just checked my phone for texts.  I'm very well.  You've got a good point.  Bob, that was very hurtful.  Yeah, I came out a little rough.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, we got another.  You want to play that other thing for Bob?  No.  What?  No, no.  What?  No.  It's nothing bad.  No.  Why do you always think we're going to go for the gag?  Really?  Because, watch, you'll start singing his sentences any time now. 
[02:08:00]  Listen, Opie.  What was your wedding song?  Dude, we're not going to do anything.  It's a video of you releasing butterflies.  Bob, we're not going to go anywhere.  What was your wedding song?  I know, by the way, the way you reacted to that video, it's the way we reacted when we  saw those butterflies coming out.  Did you get mad with the conch shell?  The guy blowing under the conch shell that actually looked like me?  Who was that guy?  Who was the...  He was a Hawaiian minister.  I thought he was going to throw Don into a volcano at the end. 
[02:08:30]  Your grandmother, very Catholic, you say?  Yes.  Yeah, she must have just been appalled by the whole thing.  She was...  A hippie, hippie wedding.  She was kind of...  She kept going, who was that guy?  I turned that to me.  Yeah.  Who was the guy?  It's supposed to be a dark church.  I know.  I got some Hawaiian with a lei and a shell blowing into it.  I know.  Bob, that's...  Mowage.  We got that scene right there.  There's the guy blowing into the conch shell.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:09:00]  Stop looking.  Oh, God.  Look, Bob.  Oh, Bob.  It's a guy blowing into the conch shell at your wedding.  I get it, Opie.  Oh.  You know what?  I want to keep my breakfast once on this show.  Oh, that's really nice.  Holy shit.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, that is really, really some nasty stuff they're doing there.  How'd you pop out?  It looks like a little Tootsie Roll.  Aw.  How cute.  Bob.  A little treat.  Get back on mic.  God, Bob. 
[02:09:30]  Be a professional.  You kidding me?  Look at it, Dane.  I can't even look at that.  I'm looking at it.  Dane's staring at it like a serial killer.  Do you watch this all the time?  Is that why you have two million friends?  I'm trolling you porn 24-7, my friend.  You porn is the best.  Oh, you porn is awesome.  Peanut Butter Smack.  Have you seen that one?  No.  It's a guy.  He's like on top of his girl.  It's like...  I endured 11 minutes of it because I'm like...  Because the titles are what really...  It's called Peanut Butter Smack, and he's like this big Samoan dude, and it's like... 
[02:10:00]  It's the worst camera angle ever, too.  Is that my wedding?  Set it behind his own butt and stuff, and then finally, like right at 11 minutes, he reaches  in, there's Peanut Butter, and he just smacks his chick.  In the face?  It's called Peanut Butter Smack.  That's it.  Yeah.  11 minutes in, he smacks her with Peanut Butter on his hand.  Hey, let's say hi to Beth in the Bronx.  Beth, what's up?  Hey, what's up, you guys?  Hey.  Opie and Anthony, I love you guys.  Jimmy, your special is fucking awesome.  Sorry.  Madam.  Hold on, hold on. 
[02:10:30]  That type of talk.  And now because you said that...  I'll not get the awesomeness of Jimmy on the air.  Now that you curse, half the people didn't hear that you said how much you love us.  I love you guys.  I'm just kidding.  Good.  And Jimmy, you were awesome.  Opie and Anthony, you guys looked adorable on his special.  And Dane Cook, I am so in love with you.  Thank you, madam, for the compliments for us just to get to the real compliment, which  was Dane.  We were actually the warm-up compliments.  Yeah.  I wasn't even in a compliment.  Dane, I bet that never happens.  Girls just, you know, throwing themselves at you. 
[02:11:00]  I don't know where it all went right, but I'll take it.  If I was Dane, I would walk through Boston with just my zipper open and just point  it shit.  The odds are someone's going to pop over and go, all right.  Jimmy, good idea.  How many naked pictures do you get from your friends?  Oh, crazy, man.  Really?  Just tons and tons of...  Yeah, some of the best.  I'm putting the book together.  Jeez, you really should.  I have a disclaimer on my site.  Once you send me something, I'm using it.  It's your property?  Yeah.  I have an opening film for the tour that people are going to see where a lot of these 
[02:11:30]  Sioux Phi pictures and stuff, they're insane.  They're insane.  Speaking of us, because we're running out of show here.  Let's get all the plugs in.  Dane, what are we promoting?  He's got...  The tour starts in Toronto tomorrow night.  Going to be in Washington, D.C. November 16th.  There's two shows at the TD Bank North Garden in Boston, which is what they're calling it  now, on November 17th.  And then the next night here in New York, two shows at Madison Square Garden.  Only the late show on that Sunday are tickets available. 
[02:12:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  He's doing what?  He's doing four arena shows in three days.  Yes.  Wow.  Actually, no.  Five arena shows.  Five.  I believe there's two at Boston, two here, and then there's one in Toronto.  Yep.  And I'm going to be doing the late show at Hooligans in Hoboken.  Do you do that for the hell of it every once in a while?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I still, you know, it's like, I'm in L.A.  Yeah, I still pop in the Laugh Factory most nights of the week.  Jamie's place.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got it.  Do they make you wait?  Jamie Posada.  Do they make me wait?  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Make them wait for some improv.  You know the other comics hate when Dane comes in because they're all getting bumped.  They're done.  Yeah.  And of course, Dane in real life is still in theaters.  Sure.  It's the number one comedy in America.  I still haven't seen it.  I was going to see it yesterday so I could be up on it a little bit.  Very heartwarming.  It'll warm the cockles of your heart, sir.  Ooh.  Very good.  And Bob, what can I say?  Uncle Vinny's.  Where are you going to be puking now?  Bobby will be puking.  I'll be at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  877 Uncle Vin.  Friday and Saturday night in Jersey.  What football team plays there? 
[02:13:00]  I'm just saying.  It's unlike, you know, Mystic Arena over here.  Hold on.  Oh, it's a stadium, though.  I didn't get it.  It was a stadium, Joe.  Plow into a wall.  It was pretty good, though.  I liked it.  I didn't get it.  Hey, Anthony, really fast.  What's this sound for tomorrow for the $1,000?  We've got to get that out of the way one more time.  And between 7 and 7.30, you're listening for what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  That's all right.  I shuffle through these so quickly.  Penn and Keller also will plug that.  They're going to be on Fox and Friends while we're doing the walkover.  Mike and Juliet.  Mike, whatever. 
[02:13:30]  Mike and Juliet.  They're going to be on.  And he already explained how he's doing the magic trick you're about to see on TV,  which I thought was hilarious that he gave away the trick for us today.  This is the sound for tomorrow between 7 and 7.30.  There you go.  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30, Tenth Caller will win $1,000.  Hey, Johnny.  Always a pleasure.  Anytime, boys.  I would say continued success, but that's...  You know, walk down to earth and do one garden show. 
[02:14:00]  Daniel will feel like he's failing when he's only doing one garden show,  and it takes more than the pre-sale to sell it out.  Hey, he's a stand-up guy, though, because a lot of...  I'll tell you something really fast here.  There's a lot of guys we get to see on the way up,  and as soon as they make it, we get to see them when they're finally...  Same people you meet?  No, I'm the way down.  But Dane's one of these guys, he still keeps in touch with the show.  He doesn't have to do this crap.  At least you don't have to worry about that with me.  No, I had a good time here, man.  I like hanging with you guys.  Without naming names, there's a lot of guys that have done that to us over the years,  but not Dane Cook. 
[02:14:30]  That needs to be said today.  Let me tell you, the minute I can sell out an arena,  I'll do a pre-recorded phoner.  Send somebody in.  Here.  Send this to those phones that I used to work with.  All right, we've got to go over to XM.  Have a great day.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bye.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  What's going on, Danny? 
[02:15:00]  And here we are.  At XM Satellite Radio.  We've got Slash in studio here at XM,  and Danny was trying to show off playing Guitar Hero 3, right?  Yeah.  Guitar Hero 3, the new one, in front of Slash,  and you were bragging pretty good the last couple days,  but then you had to do it in front of Slash,  and you failed miserably.  Yeah, I can't do anything in front of Slash.  You failed miserably.  I'm surprised I'm able to stand up in front of Slash.  Yeah, nothing's more humiliating than what I did.  But then if this calibration was off, that's what it was, 
[02:15:30]  because I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, I mean, it's good now, but I still can't function.  My heart's racing, my hands are shaking,  and I can't even do it.  I need a little bit of practice anyway,  because I got one at home,  and I put it on thinking, I'm going to kill at this,  and my security guard was over at my house,  and I said, check this out, and I couldn't play it.  And I was like, wow, I'm really out of practice.  I was really addicted to it for a minute.  I couldn't put it down.  I had to beat the whole game in one sitting.  Yeah, that's how I was with the new one, too.  Didn't answer the phone, didn't eat dinner, didn't, you know.  Yeah, that's the problem with video games.  Yeah, very addicting, man. 
[02:16:00]  That's why I love it.  I try not to play too many,  because my personality is such.  I got that OCD thing.  Yeah, same thing.  When it comes to certain things,  and one of them is video games,  I just go into another world,  and I cannot physically stop.  I can't either.  I have to beat it.  I have to get to the next thing,  and it's just.  Yeah.  You're featured in that game, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I actually wrote some music for it, too,  like when you first turn the game on,  and it goes up that cliff with the guys dueling it out,  and that's me.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That's definitely cool.  In the boss battle. 
[02:16:30]  A lot better than the Journey video game music  that was on the, I remember that one.  Wait, what was that?  Oh, we talked about that recently.  What was that again?  It was that Journey video game  that was up at WBCN.  It came out in like 82.  Yeah, it was for Atari.  Like it was really old school Atari.  And it had nothing to do with a band or anything.  It's like the members of Journey are in space  or something,  and you had to jump around.  It was pe-conk, pe-conk  with all that horrible sound.  You had to say Journey from space or something?  I'm sure there'll be a KISS game coming out  if there isn't one. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I'm sure Gene will.  Aerosmith's got a game coming out.  Activision just told me.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  2009, I think.  Speaking of KISS,  we could say into the book,  I had no idea that Paul Stanley  was trying to produce you guys back in the day.  No clue.  Good times.  Good times.  I mean, yeah, I mentioned that because I felt bad right after we told him  that we weren't interested.  I did some interview for the L.A. Times, 
[02:17:30]  and I slagged him.  Because that was my attitude at the time.  And then having forgotten that I'd slagged him,  I called him up to see if I could get some free guitars from him.  And he was like,  what did he say?  He goes,  you shouldn't air your dirty laundry and hump on you.  Right.  I was like, hey, what did I do?  Have you talked to him since or no?  I did.  Actually, what prompted me to put that in the book was I ran into him and Gene at the Rock Honors in Vegas.  And I was actually playing a Kiss song, 
[02:18:00]  and they were the headlining.  You know, they come on.  The show is for them.  It's Rock Honors Kiss.  And so they have all these different bands playing Kiss songs.  And Tommy Lee, myself, Rob Zombie, Gilby Clark, and Ace Frehley  got up together and did a Kiss song.  And I saw Gene and Paul afterwards,  and I sort of apologized to Paul.  I can't be a prick forever.  I'm an Ace freak.  He's the one member of Kiss I hadn't met.  He played last night.  I saw him.  I got a picture, of course.  He just groveled.  I emailed him last night.  I texted him last night, and I said,  what time are you playing and where? 
[02:18:30]  And he just now texts me back saying,  I thought I told you where it was.  That's great.  How was it?  He was fucking amazing because he's sober now,  and the set list was amazing.  He started with, I think, Rip It Out.  It was so fucking good.  I would have loved to have gone to that.  I'm a comedian, so a couple of us were backstage,  and we got introduced to him.  And Ace said, you guys are comedians.  Give me a joke.  And I'm trying to think of a joke.  I'm like, I've never fucking felt unfunnier in my life  than when Ace asked for a joke. 
[02:19:00]  He couldn't come off of that.  He was playing Guitar Hero.  Was that?  Sort of like him playing Guitar Hero.  I was a complete, blithering, incompetent idiot.  He played Guitar Hero.  I completely panicked.  I had nothing to say.  Hey, getting back to Paul Stanley really fast.  God bless you guys.  Like any young band trying to make it,  and all of a sudden you got Paul Stanley in front of you going,  I want to produce you guys.  I would imagine 99 out of 100 bands would go for that move,  no matter what.  But you saw something.  We were pretty hardcore.  We didn't want anybody messing with their stuff  that it wasn't supposed to be.  And I remember when we got the phone call from Geffen 
[02:19:30]  saying, Paul Stanley wants to produce you guys.  We were like, you know,  he tells us he represented the rich, fat rock star.  And we went into it.  But Steve Adler is a huge Kiss fan.  And actually, when I first started playing guitar,  it was basically with Steve and Adler playing Kiss all the time.  And so we had him come down, and we were loaded.  At least I was, as he was.  And we were all nodding out on the couch.  I mean, you know,  I can't really verbally give you a picture of it.  But anyhow, and so he hung around for a little while, 
[02:20:00]  and we had some dialogue.  And he actually, we played a gig at what used to be Guzzari's.  And he was at the board mixing the gig.  And we were like, don't touch the board, man.  And then he came down to one of our real gigs  at a place called Raji's,  which is this sweaty little dive.  And it was like at a regular volume  in a place where the people are like right here.  And that was like our real element.  And he saw that, and he was like, Jesus Christ.  You know, these guys are, you know.  Anyway, and then after that, we just said,  you know what, we're not really interested.  And that was it. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, and that's in the book.  I got to tell you, the book's called Slash.  I think the first thing he says,  I've got some definite arrangement ideas.  Welcome to the Jungle needs to be different.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, he wanted to rearrange the entire song.  That was the first day we met him.  So it was over that day.  Yeah.  We just sort of hung around for a little while.  You know, I picked up the book.  You know, I was going to read a few pages  just to get a feel before you came in here.  And I can't put the thing down.  In two days, I read, actually, it's like 230 pages.  Wow.  In two days, I can't put the thing down.  Cool.  And I'm amazed at how open and honest 
[02:21:00]  you're being in this book.  Well, there's, you know,  I don't have anything necessarily to hide.  There is a lot of stuff that's not in the book,  which I just didn't think was really necessary.  Or, you know, there's drug stuff in there  that could go on for days.  And I said, I don't want to be that guy that's like,  oh, I did all this and I did that.  So I just put in sort of the day in the life stuff  and left out the other shit.  It starts off, the first page grabs you  because it talks about your heart pounding  and you're worried about it on stage  and you feel like a weird beat on stage, 
[02:21:30]  which means like your mechanism kicked in.  No, no, it's not like a weird beat.  It's like, it's basically a defibrillator,  like the ones you put on somebody that's, you know,  the heart is stopped.  You know that bumping, how hard that is?  It's like that internally.  So what happened was when it went off,  it was like getting hit in the chest with a baseball bat  and you see a little blue light.  And I didn't know what it was, right?  Because I just got this thing,  but I didn't know anything about it, right?  And I thought it was maybe I stepped on a flash pot  or there was an electrical short.  It was really impactful. 
[02:22:00]  And it happened to me like six times that night.  And it was at Madison Square Garden  playing with Michael Jackson  when he did that 40th anniversary in 2001.  So I'm up there in front of all, you know,  that whole state, that arena  and having this happen  and trying to maintain composure.  Wow.  And we did two shows.  It was actually one on the 8th  and one on the 10th of September,  the day before 9-11.  Wow.  And so I saw it on TV about, you know,  like a month later or something.  And you never could tell that that was happening. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  It was pretty intense, though.  And I had it adjusted.  The problem was,  there was a seat,  like it's adjusted.  Basically, if your heart goes too fast,  it kicks in.  And if it goes too slow, it kicks in.  And if it goes too fast,  it's at the top of your aorta, right?  Or whatever you call it.  And so it's a real sort of high,  real impactful kind of slamming thing.  And if it's low,  it's sort of like a low thud.  So the ones I was getting were the high.  Well, what it is,  is my heart rate bounces up 
[02:23:00]  to about 10% of normal,  if not maybe a little bit more  when I go on stage,  just naturally, the adrenaline.  I forgot to tell the doctor that,  so I had to have it adjusted.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's funny stuff.  But yeah, but it grabs you  and immediately realize,  it's a great way to open the book, man.  That's what my editor thought.  I was actually, you know,  I was sort of,  I was on the fence about that.  And we talk about the autobiographies and stuff,  and bravo to you  that you didn't spend too much time  on your upbringing.  You just gave the facts, 
[02:23:30]  like the bullet points.  Yeah.  I hate when you pick up a book  on someone you really wanted to get to know,  and they spend like 100 to 200 pages.  And then when I was 12 years old,  you're like, oh my God.  Does all this need to be in the book?  I want to get to the Guns N' Roses stuff.  I want to get to the Velvet Revolver stuff.  I felt really uncomfortable  getting into that sort of self-importance thing  or taking yourself too seriously.  Oh, like I was like, who cares?  But it was just right.  You gave enough where you,  I sort of understand  what kind of upbringing you had. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  You know, that you had a white father,  a black mother.  You were brought up in Paris a little bit,  then moved back to the state.  I was conceived in Paris.  I was born in England.  But you got a lot of family still  that was over there,  and you didn't see them for many years,  and then they went to a Guns N' Roses show  years later.  Yeah.  Okay, you got it nailed.  I just want to prove  that I read the book again.  Yeah, look at you.  But I don't think I spent too much time  on any one particular subject.  It sort of hits on things,  gives a brief synopsis, 
[02:24:30]  and moves on.  Right.  I'm sure a lot of people...  I was very uncomfortable  writing the book  and talking about it.  It's not me, me, me.  It's like, ah, yes.  But that was one of the fears  I had going into it.  Yeah, I know.  What are you going to do?  Actually, it's funny.  Last night at the show,  the guy who plays guitar now  for Guns N' Roses  was there.  I don't remember his name.  I met him.  Seemed like a nice fella.  Yeah.  I never heard of him before.  I don't know him.  Yeah, I also didn't know  how much you were  into the heroin.  Yeah, I was a pretty,  you know,  big fan of the age. 
[02:25:00]  Big fan?  I always thought  it was just heavy drinking  and a drug here and there.  I didn't know that the heroin  was really a major part  of your life for a while.  I never took it on the road  and I didn't take it  into the studio.  It was something,  if I was working,  I didn't need it.  But when we were on off time,  I just didn't know  what to do with myself.  I would get bored  and I would hook up  with somebody  and then just doing it  the one time  would start this whole thing rolling.  And so nobody really knew  that much about it 
[02:25:30]  because it wasn't very public  and I was pretty private  about it.  Right.  But anybody who knows us well  knew that I was very strung out  any time that we weren't working.  Wow.  Here's a stupid  non-musician question  from a non-musician,  but is there a song  you can look at  that you did the riff for  and you're like,  that's probably the best thing  I've ever done?  Yeah.  There's definitely  a bunch of songs  that I think are amazing  or a riff  that I think is amazing  or something  that I wish I had written.  There's a Jeff Beck riff 
[02:26:00]  called Superstition  with Rod Stewart singing  back in the Jeff Beck group  which is the ultimate guitar riff  with a wobble pedal.  You have to hear it.  Anyway,  there's Black Dog  by Led Zeppelin.  There's an endless list  of great riffs.  I mean,  that's what influences you.  That's what sort of  makes you take on  certain influences  and adapt them  to your own style  and gives you  sort of your own identity.  What's your favorite riff  that you came up with?  That I came up with?  Well,  there's a couple cool ones. 
[02:26:30]  This new song,  or not new song,  but the song  on the last  Velvet Revolver record  which is called Slither  I'm pretty proud of.  Yeah, right on.  Paradise City  I thought was really cool.  As much as I didn't think it  at the time,  Sweet Child of Mine is cool.  Right.  Welcome to the Jungle.  How good is it  to be in Velvet Revolver?  It's great.  It's great.  It's great to be having  a real band together  that's out there  doing it  for the duration  after everything  that I've gone through  and not really knowing  where it was all going.  You know, 
[02:27:00]  it going in the future.  Yeah,  it must have driven you crazy  just to have this  super successful band  and just not  having any idea  if it's just going to  blow up the next day.  Well,  that,  you know,  that wasn't,  that didn't drive me crazy  so much.  It was,  I'm a real survivor  so I would put up  with a lot of,  very tenacious.  So I didn't see it  actually ending  suddenly  until all of a sudden  I just walked.  Yeah.  And then from that point on  I felt really relieved  and I just started  going out and jamming  and I wasn't very focused  as to what was going to be  my next career move  for a few years. 
[02:27:30]  Did you have any clue  like what,  what Axl's problem was  as far as  doing the shows?  It became a joke  when anyone would go  to a Guns N' Roses concert  with like how long  did you have to wait?  Yeah, I know.  That really bothered me.  The thing is  is everybody  sort of,  you know,  more or less  asks the same questions  and is your guess  as good as mine?  I have maybe my own  opinions inside  about what caused him  to do that  and this and that  and the other  but it's not something 
[02:28:00]  that I like to sort of  go out and analyze  and I didn't do that  in the book either.  I'll tell you  but he spends about  30 or 40 pages  and I can't wait  to get to that section  where he explains  why his life's  so much better  without,  without,  you know,  I mean,  with that Axl  and I will do respect  to Guns N' Roses  and Axl.  I mean,  it was probably  one of the better  rock and roll bands  of all time  and I'm very proud of it  and it's,  you know,  it would have been nice  to see it be able  to go on forever  but then it was such 
[02:28:30]  a dynamic,  explosive,  and volatile band  that it almost seems  fitting that it had  sort of a volatile end.  Sure.  But that's why  I brought up  how it must feel good  to be in Velvet Revolver  because you had to answer  Guns N' Roses questions  everywhere you went  and now you got other  pretty heavy things  to talk about  with the book  and the Velvet Revolver.  We saw you  a couple years ago  at the Hard Rock  Velvet Revolver  and it looked like  you and everyone else  was just having  a really good time  on stage.  We had a blast.  And this was before  you guys completely blew up.  There was like 400 people there 
[02:29:00]  and you guys didn't care  if it was 400  or 40 or 50,000.  You guys were just enjoying  playing rock and roll.  It was very obvious.  We got together  with that full-on  garage band kind of mentality.  Sure.  We actually put it together  the same way  that I would have put  a band together  when I was in high school.  You know,  put an ad in the recycler  and...  No, it was really...  See, we were looking  for singers before Scott  came into the picture.  Looking for guitarists,  must-have PA.  Lights.  The funny thing about...  Just because you mentioned it,  the funny thing about  Velvet Revolver though 
[02:29:30]  was that provided a forum  for everybody to ask me  questions about guns and pieces.  Oh, okay.  So, it was...  That's the reason I wrote the book  is I got such a barrage of...  It's like,  just read the book.  Yeah.  Normally, I'm not the type  to write a book, you know.  But it really needed  to alleviate some of the pressure  of having to deal with  all this misrepresentation  that's out there  through the media.  Yeah, I'm trying not  to go back to the book too much  because I want people  to pick it up for themselves  and read it.  But we mentioned  the heroin thing  and I was amazed  that Guns N' Roses 
[02:30:00]  was starting to blow up  and you didn't have  guitars to play  because you were like  pointing them off  to get some dope.  Smack it.  I was like,  wow, is that amazing.  I know.  It's like,  I have very few regrets  if none, you know.  But at the same time,  there's a couple of guitars  I wish I knew  where they went.  Oh.  And then they had  to get you guitars  when Appetite for Destruction  was being recorded.  I'm like,  this is fucked up.  It's pretty obvious  you wanted to play  in a big band  and you finally get  the opportunity  and your guitars  are gone.  Yeah, yeah, exactly. 
[02:30:30]  Well, I mean,  leading up into the recording  of Appetite,  you know,  I was a pretty bad junkie  and then once we,  you know,  got into the studio  to record Appetite,  I went cold turkeys,  quit everything,  didn't realize  I didn't have  any equipment left.  There's probably  some people out there  like what.  Do you know  whose guitar this was?  One of the guitars  I had that was great  was a Les Paul,  like a sort of,  I'm not sure  what year it was,  but it was a  Flametop Les Paul  and it used to be  Steve Hunter's.  Steve Hunter played  with Alice Cooper 
[02:31:00]  and he's the guy  that,  he played a lot of solos  that you guys  would be familiar with.  Anyway,  it was his guitar  and it was really cool.  It was a little bit beat up  and it had a great  history to it  and I wonder  how he lost it.  Yeah,  right?  How did I get this thing?  Is this,  you may not know  the answer to this,  but it's something  that's been bugging me  for years  and I have to ask you.  My Michelle,  who is that written about?  That's Michelle Young  and she was  a really good friend  of mine  and my girlfriend's  back when I was  in junior high school  and high school.  And then Axel Bander.  And yeah, 
[02:31:30]  and then somehow  it's funny  because I basically  left school  and was pretty much  a loner for a long time  and then Guns N' Roses  came together  and somehow  a lot of my  high school  and junior high school  friends from way before  all of a sudden  sort of came into the picture  and these girls  weren't really tuned up  to that speed.  And so they started  mixing up with  the likes of our band.  And it was interesting  because I knew them all  and my girlfriend  had been my girlfriend  for like six years  when I was like 13 to 19  and all her friends  all of a sudden 
[02:32:00]  a lot of them  got on smack  a lot of them  turned to color  all of them  had major problems  just destroyed  from hanging out  a few of them  live in Minneapolis now  because they needed  to go over  to someone's house  that lives in Minneapolis  that was my old girlfriend  because she's clean  to go and sober up  and they still live there.  So a trip.  Yeah, so Guns N' Roses  took a lot of people down.  A lot of people  wanting to jump on the bandwagon  and hang out  and have a good time  and then trying to  keep up with that  ended up sort of  going by the wayside.  And you didn't have a home  for how many years?  You know, I always found 
[02:32:30]  some place to go.  I didn't live anywhere  until I got an apartment  after the first  Guns N' Roses tour  was over in 1989.  Right, but before that  you were going from  your mom's house  your dad's house  grandma's house  girlfriend's house  strip clubs  recording studios  Yeah, recording studios  where strippers live  strippers places  There's a whole apartment  complex in LA  where the strippers live.  That was a great place.  You would have liked it.  There was a lot of spirit  in that building.  There's a place like that  I hang out here 
[02:33:00]  but they're all fat chicks.  That's a hate  you know, fat chicks  do it all.  They try harder.  It's true.  Sorry.  What's the fat chicks?  What's hard to the fat chicks?  Yeah, why are you saying  sorry to the fat chicks?  Because you probably  never had to bang one.  Are you kidding?  I like big girls.  Yeah.  Silence.  Silence is  nothing wrong with silence  on the radio.  It's a relaxed atmosphere.  Do you have that kind of  comfortable silences 
[02:33:30]  on the radio?  Finally, yeah.  When we first started radio  it was like  someone talked  but now you just  kind of let the moment  just be for a second  I guess.  I don't know.  Let it sink in.  Especially when a joke bombs  we like letting the person  have to sit there  and just suck it up  and eat their balls.  Well, Jimmy brought that  to the radio show  back in the day  when Ant and I  were doing it  and we would bomb  on something  there was a panic  you would feel uncomfortable  you would heat up  and the other guy  would try to cover  for the other one, right?  Jimmy was the one  that brought it  to the show  like, Slay 
[02:34:00]  let's just stop the show  and enjoy that bomb.  Point out the bomb.  Yeah, there's nothing better  than someone just  bombing on a joke.  Yeah, right.  Oh, it's just awful.  Comedians are the worst  because they love  going to clubs  and watching other comics  just to eat their balls.  There's nothing better  than sitting in the back  of the club.  I've watched my friends  just suffer  and you know  they're pulling  every fucking trick  out of the bag  and they're just up there  dying.  Just flailing.  There's nothing more  wonderful than watching  We have shows like that  too, yeah.  I'm familiar with that.  Well, I know  from being in a couple 
[02:34:30]  of bands  you never want to see  the guy that replaced you  playing with your band.  Yeah.  You don't want to watch that.  You want to see him  fuck up or sound like shit.  Actually, we were talking  I was talking earlier  about this with someone  I went to a Guns N' Roses  show in Vegas  just to go see  what that was all about.  Wow.  So I'd never stood  in front of Guns N' Roses  but I wasn't allowed in.  Get out of here.  I've never seen it.  They wouldn't let you in?  They wouldn't let me in.  You've got to get a disguise.  Well, I didn't know  that was going to happen. 
[02:35:00]  You've got to get a disguise.  They wouldn't let you in?  Wow.  What did they say to you?  You can't?  I think it was the manager  at the time  and he just said  what happened was  I called up one guy  one of the promoters  and said  can you get me tickets  into the gig?  And that was the same night  as the show.  I flew from LA  to Las Vegas  got to the Hard Rock  and everybody in the building  knew I was coming.  It was like this big thing.  So I got to the room  and was getting ready  to go down there  with my wife 
[02:35:30]  and everything  and the security  came to my room  and knocked on the door  and said  no, we can't let you out.  Either stay here  or leave the building.  Otherwise they probably  didn't want you  to overshadow the guitarist  they had playing.  I think they thought  that if Axl was aware  that I was in there  I would intimidate  his performance.  Oh really?  Wow, man.  It seems to me  I've never met the guy  in my life  but it seems to me  like he was afraid  like Carly Stein.  A lot of people  have that performance fear  and they have a terror.  I think he's a real  perfectionist  and he's especially 
[02:36:00]  putting out this record  that he's a little bit  worried about  how it's going to be  perceived or something.  He wants it to be amazing  and have everybody  perceive it as such  and he's a little  intimidated by his own success.  You know what's interesting  about that?  Going back to the book  but I can't believe  I'm amazed  at how easy  a lot of these  classic Guns N' Roses  songs came about.  Yeah.  Because you would think  especially because you do  read about Axl  being this perfectionist  supposedly  like some of these  great songs  that we all know  and love  like were made  in hours.  Yeah.  Like hours. 
[02:36:30]  You came up with a riff  and someone comes in the room  like hey keep playing that  and then all of a sudden  they fucked around  with the lyrics a little bit.  Grinding it out.  That's true.  It would happen  in a few hours  in an evening  basically.  But I think that was  just the chemistry  of those particular  five guys  just having a good time  together  and it just happened.  Like Sweet Child of Mine  I'll give you an example.  You come up with a riff  and they figure something out  and then they're stuck  and Axl just to himself  is this really true? 
[02:37:00]  And he's just saying  to himself  where do we go?  Where do we go now?  Where do we go?  He's trying to figure out  vocally where to go  with this song  and someone goes  just say that.  And it was that simple?  There was a producer  that we were working with  and it was something  like that.  That was how I remembered it.  It was we got to  a certain section  in the song  and it was like  where do we go  and someone was like  hey that's it  we'll just do that.  Yeah where do we go now?  I believe in spontaneity  and rock and roll.  I think that you have to  I'm a perfectionist  to an extent as well. 
[02:37:30]  Nobody beats me up  more than myself  about guitar playing  and all that kind of shit  but you have to  go with the vibe  of you know  like you can't sit  and think about it too much.  You have to just sort of  let it happen  and see what comes out  at the end of the day.  Creativity is so  You can't analyze it.  Creativity is so weird  because sometimes  you know doing a radio show  like sometimes  it comes like  it's so easy  like wow  you're just sitting back  and it's happening  and then other times  as a creative person  you're struggling  like God  how do we get something  going here?  It's so weird  but sometimes 
[02:38:00]  you just hit that groove  and you go.  When you hit that moment  where all of a sudden  you can't seem to come up  with anything  and you start trying  and then it just gets  right  it's just like quicksand  and that's the worst feeling  for a creative person  but you know  it happens.  But you feel lazy  when it's not happening  you're like  I'm a bum  I'm not doing anything creative  totally  I'm just fucking off  but it kind of has to be  it has to inspire you  on some level  just to  oh okay  here it is  it moves  when it does happen  you're like  that's the best feeling  in the world  I don't think  anything beats that  How close were you 
[02:38:30]  to joining Poison  back in the day?  That made me laugh  in the book  Yeah I know  It was  I don't know  what happened  was their first guitar player  this guy named Matt  called me up  and said that he was  going back to Pennsylvania  to I guess his girlfriend  was pregnant  he was going to get married  and all that  and I should hook up  with Poison  I was out in LA  just looking for a gig  always just wandering  from group to group  and just picking up  where I could  and trying to get exposure  and all that kind of stuff  and Poison was  by far the biggest club band 
[02:39:00]  at that time  and says you should go  try out for Poison  you know  and I was like  there's an image thing  that was a real contrast  a little bit of a problem  yeah  and so  but I went down  to their rehearsal place  in LA  and they gave me a tape  of like four or five songs  and I learned those songs  and came back the next day  and played them with the band  and kicked the shit out of them  it's like  you know  and so they were  they were pretty much stunned  by that  you know  because I don't think  Matt was really  what you consider  a great guitar player 
[02:39:30]  but I had a good feel  you know  so they had me come down  another day  and I played  and then we had  this long conversation  about fashion  and that's when it really  the obvious  became really  even more apparent  I just imagine  after you ripped up  the audition  and killed  that the next step  was they handed you  mascara  and you went  whoa  well yeah  it really  the basis  for the sort of  fashion discrepancy  was they asked me  about my shoes  like what kind of shoes  are you going to wear  and I was wearing some  you know  what I consider 
[02:40:00]  cool beat up moccasins  and I was like  what's the issue  with the shoes  and then  I think we went on  to like  what kind of outfit  and they sort of knew  that they were getting  nowhere  and so when I was  leaving that day  though  Cece was walking in  and that was the classic  part of the whole thing  was I was walking out  and Cece was walking in  we didn't know each other  but he was like  dolled up in like  light blue and white  and blonde  teased hair  and that was  an audition  I guess it was  a sort of dress rehearsal  to him  and I just said  that's the guy  enjoy the gig 
[02:40:30]  and I got the phone call  saying it's not going  to work out  we're going to use Cece  and I was like  all things considered  it was sort of a relief  you know  and I moved on  to do some other stuff  and consequently  Guns N' Roses started  and then we became  sort of like  you know  sort of  pseudo rival bands  in LA  because we hated them  and they didn't  necessarily hate us  but we had such  a bad attitude  they couldn't help it  they had to hate us  because we hated them  so much  and that's the way  it went  how do you feel  if you're poison  though and you're blue  getting slashed over  shoes  fucking idiots  that was the scene 
[02:41:00]  back then  everyone was wearing  the makeup  no you know  but Cece is so perfect  for that band  he couldn't have been  anybody else  his match made in heaven  for them  and there was a moment  Guns N' Roses  like slightly went that way  with glam  and then said  you know what  we don't need to do this  well there was  there was  we came from  sort of the  Hanoi Rocks  New York Dolls  kind of  you know  like early Rolling Stones  kind of mentality  the glam thing  in LA  was more like  trying to put together  like a mixture 
[02:41:30]  of Kiss  and T-Rex  or something  it was very glam  David Bowie  all that  we were sort of  like a gutter glam  and so we had that look  but we sort of  you know  got sort of tired  of having to  make the effort  to do it  it wasn't something  that we really  tried real hard  it wasn't like  an image  that we were  concocting  you know what I mean  of sort of what  we wore at the time  and it just started  to fall off  and just become  jeans and T-shirts  definitely a refreshing  change from  a lot of the  hair band stuff  that was going on  at the time 
[02:42:00]  you guys came out  and people were  just like  it was a kick in the ass  like holy shit  wow  it was cool  this is rock  definitely a good time  I think Motley Crue  was the first glam band  that came out  of like serious glam band  and that was  a real image for them  and I think  everybody else  was sort of following  yeah yeah  they kind of  yeah  a lot of everybody  was just trying to look  like a bunch of fags  yeah that's what  it boiled down to  it was like  what the fuck  are these guys doing man  you played on  I'm sorry  no it's together  just with the  the big teased out hair 
[02:42:30]  and even the  the choreography  and the videos  remember bands like  are you guys  fucking each other  what are you doing  yeah  yeah white lion  right  you played on  I Ain't No Nice Guy  oh yeah  Ozzy and Lemmy  it's fucking  it's one of my favorite  unheralded songs  that is a great song  and Lemmy wrote it  Lemmy's a great song  yeah he's brilliant  I was really proud  to play on that song  I still actually have  the lyrics from the  original when he first  gave them to me  in my acoustic guitar case  you know  cause it's a great lyrics 
[02:43:00]  it really says a lot  about a lot of us  yeah yeah yeah  it's really great  and it sounded almost  like when he did it  cause I've asked  Lemmy's manager  I wanted to hear a version  with just Lemmy singing  cause I'm an Ozzy fanatic  but it sounded like  they were in different studios  when they were  the original version  with just Lemmy singing  the whole thing  I have to admit is better  yeah  it's more personal  yeah it's a live version  I actually might go back  and cover that song one day  that's great dude  oh Jimmy  I can't believe you  actually said something  that kind of wasn't  pro-Ozzy 
[02:43:30]  oh no no no  Ozzy's great on it  but there's something  about the way  Lemmy sings it  it sounds so him  and when Ozzy comes in  and sings it  it sounds like  Ozzy singing Lemmy's song  yeah  but he would never  admit to anything like that  no I would on that one though  Jimmy would suck  Ozzy's dick  Jimmy's the biggest Ozzy fan  it's not gay  if you're humming Crazy Train  but no it's  it just sounded like  they were in different studios  and Lemmy  when you hear Lemmy  singing something like that  or like 1916  it's like you hear Lemmy  kind of singing  like a ballad  it's just great  cause he's such an animal  and I'm singing something soft 
[02:44:00]  it really comes from the heart  with him  yeah  yeah  Ozzy  it begins and ends  with Ozzy  with Jimmy  well yeah but also  I mean I love  I'm a motorhead freak too  and Iommi  you have to love Iommi right  yeah I love Iommi  oh good  he's great  we  Velvet Revolver opened  for Sabbath  on the Monsters of Rock tour  a couple years back  it was a great tour  it was great to see  Black Sabbath  all back together  and doing  they sounded amazing  it was a lot of fun  yeah I was  we had  who was it  Stuart Copeland  from the police 
[02:44:30]  over  we interviewed him  the drummer  and I asked him  about Bill Ward  and he went  who is that  and I wanted to spit on him  oh yeah  he did not know Bill Ward  he seemed clueless  in general  with music  you didn't know  that Puff Daddy  like redid one of his songs  it was like  a little strange man  he had a great band  I mean it's wonderful  but enough already  how do you not know Bill Ward  looks like he really  wasn't into doing the rock thing  he kind of was just  thrown into that  right  yeah I think so  who were we talking about again  Stuart Copeland  that's what I thought  I said  that makes me happy  by the way too  that slash you said  who is he  he's like fuck him  Stuart Copeland 
[02:45:00]  is the drummer  the police  he's sort of a college  drummer kind of guy  he's a really really good  technical drummer though  I have to say that  but I couldn't imagine him  knowing shit about shit  no he's a rock star  he's not a rock star vibe  it's like you know  and then  we get it  you know  one other music  thing from the book  I was really surprised  to read that  you were a Cars fan  or you heard  the Cars first album  yeah  because all the other bands  you mention in the book  of course  Quiet Riot  and you know 
[02:45:30]  it runs the gamut  but then the Cars  yeah the Cars  well there was a  you know  during the very beginning  of what you would consider  the new wave run  the Cars were like  one of the first bands  that came out  and they were  that first record  was really cool  I love the Cars  but I just  can't imagine  Slash would be into  a band like the Cars  yeah I know  I like the Cars  and Ellie Easton  is a great guitar player  and they just had  a very cool  kind of sound  and you know  songwriting  kind of thing  I think again  that was another band  that kind of other bands  took up that feel 
[02:46:00]  by 1982  we had a lot of bands  like the Cars  even the Cars  were the Cars  you know I thought  it was interesting  what I read  because I haven't read  as much as Opie has  in the book  but you talk about  your mom being  I think a clothing designer  where she designed  all these things  for these cool  David Bowie  and others  Bowie  and as a kid  who was it  George Harrison  and like apparently  your mother said  that you did meet Lennon  but you don't remember  meeting John Lennon  she did a suit  for Lennon  and she also did  something for Ringo Starr  which I did meet him  but I still actually  know him from that 
[02:46:30]  period  but John Lennon  I don't remember  ever meeting  but she did do  some clothes for him  that's great  damn if you had  to remember  she made clothes  for a lot of people  I can sit here  and just go through  this long list  it was very cool  and I of course  didn't totally appreciate  it at that age  but looking back on it  it was good people  to be hanging around  yeah well it's interesting  when you talk about  going into the family history  like you went into  just enough family history  like we got to know  your mother  your father a little bit  but it wasn't so  some people go back  generations  because they want  to fill book space  but you didn't do that  but you made it 
[02:47:00]  like interesting to read  because of course  you want to know something  yeah with that  we're getting the word  he's got to go  oh no who's saying that  I swear  usually we do that  as a gag  but they really did  give me a note  saying you gotta go  when we're bored  with someone  we go oh they're  saying you gotta go  and the person  will start looking around  like who said that  on my own  you said that  but I swear to god  I can't even show you  the post  you really do have  to go to other interviews  his people  I came with nobody  what are you talking about 
[02:47:30]  I did that in front of  Ed Asner  was the worst moment ever  Lou Grant  from Mary Tyler Moore  who doesn't love Ed Asner  I love Ed  yeah  of course you don't  want to hear this story  what did you do  you told him  you know what  we gotta go  Anthony was playing poker  at where were we  LA  the commerce casino  and I was doing  the show with Jimmy  and a few other people  and Ed Asner  was boring the hell  out of us  I just looked down  like oh they're  giving me the sign  that you gotta go  or what did you  Ben did 
[02:48:00]  our old producer  moved a certain way  and hopes and all  that's the saying  that you gotta go  and he goes  and Ed goes  what do you mean  and he goes  well that's the signal  they give us  when a guest is being  boring  and my heart sank  I'm like this is  Lou Grant  then he called me  the destroyer  got ugly  and blah blah blah  but they're really  telling me you have  to go  I swear to god  you're probably  doing a million  interviews today  are you doing  signings today  I got a signing  tonight in Jersey  where in Jersey  I wish I had  in front of me  for you  I don't know  bookends  oh yeah  that's right 
[02:48:30]  bookends  bookends  oh bookends  in Ridgewood  that's an independent  store  we did one in  Huntington  in Long Island  yesterday  Huntington at the  book review  yeah  they get everybody  and then we did  Barnes and Noble  downtown  you got a picture  with Bill Clinton  yeah I got a picture  with Bill  outside that bookstore  slash always a pleasure  we love you  you know that  the book is awesome  I was only going to  read a few pages  because very busy  these days  but I'm like  holy crap  I can't put this  thing down  oh that's cool  and this is my  first book 
[02:49:00]  so I definitely  didn't really  know what I was  doing  I can't wait  to read the rest  I just got to  the part where  actually one of  your friends  well leave it  for the book  yeah  sorry  see that's what  I mean  I'm that excited  I want to just  blur out everything  that's something  that happens  here in town  yeah yeah  I've never seen him  actually take a book  and make sure  the intern gave him  a good one sheet  on it  really  no  you don't understand  he never reads  not that you don't  read a book  I don't mean that  he never reads  I don't mean that  I mean the guest books  he'll always just go 
[02:49:30]  I got nothing on this one  a good handful  of guys I talk to  have no shame  in going  I didn't read it  but I heard  I googled  and said some stuff  about  most books  are a waste of time  let's be honest  you know Dirt  was amazing  I stopped actually  reading rock and roll  books a long time ago  you read Dirt  they're all your boys  I know  so I didn't read it  I know  oh my god  that's amazing  why read it  I just  I got turned off  of rock books  a long time ago  because they were  just the product  of a lot of  conjecture  and sensationalism 
[02:50:00]  and this and that  and the other  it was like  somebody's fantasy  to sort of put  take the topic  and make up stuff  and fill a book  with it  but an autobiography  or like Dirt  or the Aerosmith book  that's where the guys  actually sit there  she even has her coat on  geez give us a break here  just give us the big  Velvet Revolver  where you at with that  we're going back on the road  we just did  like a two and a half month  stint in the states  we're going to Japan  and Australia  next month  awesome  and we start in Europe  in January  so a lot going on  all at the same time  yeah 
[02:50:30]  and I love the Velvet Revolver stuff  big time  I appreciate it  this book is great  it's called Slash  and obviously  it's going to probably  hit the best seller list  it's fantastic  that'd be cool  alright look  and now this guy's  coming close  to drag you out  but thanks for having me  it's great talking to you guys  great having you in here  let me play Guitar Hero  for a second  just to remind you  how bad I am at it  it was great to watch  our own Danny  really freaking out  and folding  under pressure  you're folding  under pressure Hendry  she's picking up  her pocketbook

[02:53:00]  what's up Joe  hey you guys wanted to  count on uh  Tuesday  the number of times  the Iraq is jabbed at  every day  yeah  um yesterday  it was 16  and that includes  true really  really brutal ones  by Jimmy and Anthony  while the R.E.M.  was playing  before he left  uh so wow  we hit him hard  yesterday  uh today  yeah we hit him hard  today  Jimmy said that his  fiancée was gonna  hide the cookies  or throw the cookies  away or something  like that  yeah  alright  thanks guys  thank you Joe  I didn't mean this 
[02:53:30]  uh by the way  it's gotta be pointed  out that uh  Danny pretty much  lost his mind  did you get a picture  with him  we saw a side of  Danny today  that I uh  I quite frankly  haven't seen yet  yes sober  he was  he was in a bit  of a panic  in the presence  of Slash  he brought in  Guitar Hero 3  he set it up  all nice  and the whole  reason he set it up  was not so Slash  could play  it was so he could  play in front of Slash  in front of Slash  no I want you to  play with  actually I wanted  to beat Slash  because I thought  that would be funny  but uh  but no he had a 
[02:54:00]  good time playing it  but I couldn't  I could not  calm myself down  because  no you were shaking  and then you blew it  we want you to  do uh  clips of Dover again  because I bet you  now you'll master it  now that he's not  in here anymore  he was  what he was doing  was um  first uh  uh  clicking through  the menus  various menus  really fast  like just  click tick tick  I know what I'm  doing  I know where I'm  going  and then expert  hits expert  and then  I go you're an  expert  he goes yeah  yeah  and he says  way down the  song list  gotta get to  those last ones 
[02:54:30]  yeah  clips of Dover  kicks it off  starts up  and it's just like  clank clank  fail  fail  throw it off  and Slash is just like  oh wow  yeah  what happened there  you're pretty good  you might want to  start with Sloan  he finished 5%  of the song  Jesus  5% in front of Slash  so then you recalibrated  yeah  because obviously  you blamed it on the  um  calibration  HDTV  see some TVs have 
[02:55:00]  an audiovisual lag  yes  and then Slash I guess  did a design on your guitar  yeah I went out to  Guitar Center yesterday  and I was trying to decide  what to try to get signed  and it was either  just spend you know  like 20 bucks on a pick guard  and then get a Les Paul  when I have the money  or just get a fucking Les Paul  and I was like  fuck that  you bought a Les Paul  just so Slash could sign it  absolutely fucking  how much  it's amazing  you're a huge Slash fan  I didn't know  who is it  I mean it's Slash  but I mean  is he one of your big  wow you're panicking 
[02:55:30]  yeah  oh my god  E-Rock just gave it to Opie  how much is that  I'm not gonna do it  it's not a very expensive one  but you know  it read me about  wait Danny  I don't know much about you  so Guns N' Roses  is huge for you  oh sure  one of the biggest  sure  definitely top 10  absolutely top 10  top 10  I think  it's not top 5  I think it's in most people's top 10  yeah how can they not be  Slash is probably  definitely a top 5  top 5 all time  all time guitarist  this is not as impressive  as I thought  who's higher than Slash 
[02:56:00]  in the list  yeah  well you gotta have guys  like Clapton  in there  Clapton is god  well yeah  leave his guitar  I can't  panicking  yeah I am panicking  oh when E-Rock  like if Opie grabbed it  you would know  he's either  not going to break it  or break it  on purpose  with E-Rock  he could just  fumble it  yeah  oops  sorry  I had some garlic  butter stuff  on my hand  mayo smear  mayo smear  can E-Rock  play a song  no  Kirk Hammett 
[02:56:30]  to answer your question  another person  I would put in my top 5  oh yeah  I met Kirk  so you're into  guitar gods  yeah  sure  I mean I wanted  so who's your  number one guitar god  Jimmy Page  you play guitar  yeah  oh I didn't know that  yeah  it sounds silly  because he might not  be as technical  as Kirk Hammett  but I gotta go  James Hatfield  I gotta go James  the whole package  attitude  oh yeah  he's so badass  playing  he's cute  singing  he's cute  he is  it's funny  short hair or long  doesn't even matter 
[02:57:00]  no  it was so  it was so funny  long silly  when they played on SNL  did you see them  they were on SNL live  and it was so weird  because I was sitting there  watching them warm up  and I got  no no  honestly  Brewer brought me  when he was on SNL  and Metallica  was the music guest  so I got to watch them  play Fuel and Memory Remains  you dropped something  20 names  25 feet away  I'm just watching this song  over and over  I mean  a fan wants to call me out  on my tattoo that I have  oh  what tattoo you got  it's from the Metallica 
[02:57:30]  live Binge and Purge album  oh yes of course  right on your right shoulder  there it is  call it the scary guy  so Slash  can I see this  you want to do it  are you panicking  yes very much so  alright here  Slash already sweated  my deodorant off  so now you're making me smell  alright here  take your guitar  show us what he put on your  do you like  do you like Lars Ulrich  I love Lars  I do  Lars is a faggot  no he's not  well I mean  I'm kidding  oh  we like Lars  so yeah Slash  he did the 
[02:58:00]  like skull and crossbones  he draws on it  yeah like a skull and crossbones  wearing a top hat  and smoking a cigarette  yeah  a little banner  which looks like  he wrote GNF and R  which of course  got some fucking roses  yeah  and then Slash  and then Slash  now you can't play the thing  I didn't buy it  I didn't buy it  that is now a piece of art  that goes on a wall  like I purposely took a trip  to Guitar Center  how much did the guitar  cost you  well I could have went  a little more expensive  I don't want to hold it  it was like $4.50  that's worth it man  for a guy you love this time  you just increased the value 
[02:58:30]  of it too  I don't know  I was going to go big time  but I was like  no don't be an idiot  that's fine  $4.50  that's fine  going to go big time  why would you  I mean that's a guitar  you're never going to play  it looks cool  it has the signature  you're just ready  to put it on the wall  I never got a guitar  or something signed  but I gotta be honest  looking at that  that is a cool idea  it's gorgeous  I mean the guitar  itself is gorgeous  now it's just  don't say gorgeous again  it's gorgeous  people are yelling  not people  look at the flying  one person  CM Mark  a regular to the radio show  he goes  how could you not mention  Johnny Cash 
[02:59:00]  do you know Johnny Cash  is a guitar player  no he was good  but I mean  you don't think  like I don't listen  to Johnny Cash songs  and go wow  listen to him play  I might be showing  how stupid I am  if we were talking  top ten songwriters  I would definitely  include Johnny Cash  I love Johnny Cash  but as top five  guitar players of all time  I'm not going to include  Johnny Cash  Randy Rhodes is a  wonderful guitar player  guitarist  yeah  The Wall's my favorite  Johnny Cash song  if anybody gives a turkey  by the way  yeah thank you  for reminding me  this is where  this is coming from  Danny  it didn't go unnoticed 
[02:59:30]  that you got so  comfortable with Slash  you decided to make  yourself part of the show  sat down  got your microphone  someone else  Jimmy help me out  he actually snapped  at someone to get  him coffee  he sat down  all comfortable  and I think  then something  happened in his mind  where he went  oh my god  what am I doing  and then you were gone  Slash sat on my left  in between me and Anthony  here's what Danny  did on my right  he sat down  and did the old  I'm adjusting the  headphones  like  yeah no 
[03:00:00]  we were playing  he leaned up  on the console  leaned up  he was like  I'm comfortable  we had just been  playing a little  me and my buddy  Slash  we're playing Guitar Hero  over there on the couch  and I thought that was  going to be a topic  of discussion  so I thought  let me make myself  available  should it become a topic  yeah  you want to play  a little Guitar Hero 3  who gives a shit  about that  exactly  I want to hear  clips of Dover  you're bragging about it  because I know  what's going to happen  because I go  you're going to eat your balls  he's doing the level  it's like beginner  what are the levels  you got easy 
[03:00:30]  medium hard  and expert  thank you  so he goes to expert  I'm like  expert  expert  and he looks  and makes sure  Slash is listening  oh yeah  yeah I'm an expert  at this  I wish Slash would have  taken the guitar  and broken it  over your head  the good Les Paul  like an animal house  scene  just smashed it  against the wall  if you knew me better  he would have  by the way  Shane Schneider  from Philly  very pissed off  that you didn't  was it Shane  oh no  it updated  I'm sorry  hold on a minute  I want to give the credit  where credit is due  where credit is due  now it might be 
[03:01:00]  oh yeah  it was Gabe  from Staten Island  very pissed off  that you didn't mention  the great Papa Rock  as far as guitar names go  he's the greatest  fiddler of all time  fiddling  Papa Rock's not a great  guitarist though  no  this is literal Jim  that's my new character  on the show  literal Jim  literal Larry  Larry literal  Larry literal  is his name  by the way  Dumbledore is gay  of course  he can't really  technically be gay  because he's not  like a real person  yeah  let's go  Larry literal 
[03:01:30]  strikes again  Larry literal  I like Larry literal  let's go with  Cliffs of Dover  come on  a little piece  let's see if this works  why do you have  a ripe written  on your shirt then  that's the people  that Sam and I  did that online  member  thing  oh yeah  remember me and Oak  were offered to do it  and we said  there's no fucking way  we'd ever do something  like that  and Sam and I  jumped at the chance  right  all right  he's clicking through  he's going all the way  to the bottom  he's fiddling  yeah  to Cliffs of Dover 
[03:02:00]  yeah  can we get up  I don't know this one  wait  it's very hard  so uh  is this  the hardest song  to do on Guitar Hero 3  it's one  hold on  there's only a couple  others  it's one of them  yeah  Eric Johnson  all right  I mean I still can't  beat a few of these  all right here we go  this is Danny  attempting Cliffs of Dover  Guitar Hero 3  I gotta calibrate the lag 
[03:02:30]  oh no  you're already calibrated  it's not shaking up  dude  I can fall  wait a minute  oh yeah  okay  yeah  how about  the lag between  your brain  and your fingers  wait wait wait  how about you go to  level one  and do fog  you go to my career  and you'll see my score  we look like assholes  right now man  hello exactly  but the magic  you got the touch  you got the power  Eric and his fucking  numb fingers  Eric and his fucking numb fingers  are trying to do better than you  I forced started  there's my proof  yeah okay 
[03:03:00]  there's my high score  179  no that's some 13 year old  from Staten Island  brought his game in today  now do Cliffs of Dover  I'm gonna calibrate the lag again  all right  calibrate the lag  go ahead  calibrate the lag  do whatever you need to do Danny  and wait  the notes come flying at you  and you have to hit the colors  with your left hand  and strum  and strum at the same time  it's ridiculous  and worked a whammy bar  oh yeah  that's good for your star  and then just rock  like  yeah you gotta do a little rock  is he on pal talk  for the pal talkers 
[03:03:30]  so they can see him rocking  yeah let me get to  the rocking part's the best  I'm at number one  a lot of people just writing  boo  so they should write hiss  wait he's calibrating though  so it sounds like  a little snapping  and it's off by nothing  so  apparently I just really stopped  yeah  no he did good  he did good  you fumbled through it  let's give him one more shot  go ahead Dan  another shot  don't worry  this is only about  maybe right now  maybe 750,000 people listening 
[03:04:00]  unless you believe the daily news  which is 11 people listening  yeah  yeah  all right here's  are you making the clicking  they're calling him fumbledore  we're miking the actual guitar  so you can hear the  so you can hear the clicking of it  yeah  that's great  all right here we go  it's gonna sound awesome  why am I doing this  on the radio  your tool  there we go  nice 
[03:04:30]  hold on  start over again  holy  oh my god he didn't get  through one note  let's see what percentage  that was  what happened  was Mars adjusting your mics  can you make it  3%  3%  that's pretty good  all right well if anybody  wants to challenge me at home  so welcome to my gamer tag  hello exactly  dude  stop fiddling  they're saying  I'm hitting it  the way I hit it at home 
[03:05:00]  the crowd is getting vicious  then maybe your home  calibration is off  and your TV thinks  you're better than you are  this just proves  you can't do anything  without drinking  yeah maybe that's the  calibration you need  all right well  we need to experiment with that  here we go  you just need to be  mellow man  here we go  dude  oh  good job 
[03:05:30]  all right well  I'll be more than happy  to kick everybody's ass  all right here's a beer  oh god  no wait Danny  that was level what  that's a hard level  don't go with expert  why don't you just go  with the new guy  yeah maybe  maybe you need a warm up  why don't you do  uh slow ride  bam  yeah dude  smoke on the water  no do  give us a cool song  all right but  it's I mean  it's not a question  of the number of notes  that are coming at me  it's that if the timing  is off  obviously when I try to hit  even a few notes 
[03:06:00]  it's going to be off  we hear you  we at least  we finally found a bit  though for you  you want me to knock it  down to hard  I'll knock it  I'll go down  it's Danny sucking  at video games  I don't know  you guys can pick  I don't know  whatever you want to do  how about whatever  you think you can do  without butchering it  how about uh  paint it black  how about that  that's too easy  go down a little further  paranoid  all right let's hear this  here let's hear some  Sabbath  here we go  this couldn't have  worked out any other way  I just want you  people to know  why you're kicking ass  this is perfect for us  we don't want you 
[03:06:30]  we don't want to hear you  doing it right  who gives a shit  of course  all right here we go  paranoid  that wouldn't be any fun  oh yeah I can see a song  it's like space invaders 
[03:07:00]  oh a 50 note streak  I got used to the timing  it's a little early  yeah he's rocking it  though  yes he is  I would get through  one note  so now I have star power 
[03:07:30]  Jimmy  so what I do to activate  my star power  is I have to lift up  my guitar  like I'm a big rock star  and I get extra points  I wish I made it over  yeah  he's got star power  if only I could be good  at something in real life  oh you're a good boy  well he's got this one  figured out  it's the timing  it's the timing  it's slightly different  than it is on my CV  this is pretty cool actually  he's rocking 
[03:08:00]  look at his rock meter  he's got the rock meter  pinned right  yeah  I've only played this  a couple times  kind of cool  it's hard  it is hard  we missed one  fuck  we dropped something  it's like listening to someone  play piano with catcher's mitts on  star power ready 
[03:08:30]  50 note streak  that sound is  maddening  it really is  that tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick  they should have this game 
[03:09:00]  with tambourines  well they kind of  that's coming out  it's called rock band  microphone has it built in tambourine  oh no  good job  dan  star power  yeah  200 note streak  wow  all right good  from the easier level  you  you're good  all right  wow  that doesn't really  and he gets a big u rock  of course  all right  go back to  one more try 
[03:09:30]  one more expert  on that  yeah how about anything on expert  expert  i'm telling you that the timing is off  he says timing again  i'm gonna bite  that one you did fine  your timing is not gorgeous  exactly  your tap tap tap  timing is off  why don't you sit down  and kick your feet up  and talk about it  for a few minutes  yeah we're keeping your seat warm  over here danny  we'll have the post interview  will you manage to slash that  where you wanted to sit  we'll make sure next time  he sits on the couch  fucking  don't worry  they're working on the  opie anthony and danny promos
