<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened by reaffirming their controversial "shock jock" persona and immediately launched into "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a segment featuring topless women on Paltalk, comparing it to pornography.  The conversation took a sharp turn to discuss anti-Semitic graffiti, followed by an insensitive comedic riff on Rosh Hashanah, mispronouncing "shofar" as "chauffeur."  They offered a humorous, irreverent take on why Moses wasn't allowed into the Promised Land.  A large portion focused on their promotional appearance for "3:10 to Yuma," complaining about the guest actor and discussing faking celebrity interviews, referencing Man Cow's techniques.  Recurring segments included "Whip Em Out Wednesday" and the newly introduced "Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday," showcasing offensive bits like "Kid Rock'em Sock'em Robot."  The Patriots' cheating scandal was debated with a Boston caller defending the team.  The show interspersed listener calls, awkward sports commentary from missed calls, and a news story about a man in a wheelchair being tased in court. Kevin Everett's recovery from a near-paralyzing injury was discussed, contrasting it with the initial inaccurate prognosis.  Their upcoming Philadelphia live broadcasts and packed schedule were heavily promoted.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned as being in-studio alongside Opie and Anthony.


The show continued with further discussion of "Morning Zoo Bits of the Day," including playful banter about the name.  A spirited debate about the Patriots and Jets, and dislike for a certain sports personality ensued.  A listener-submitted song, "Hell No to H2O," mocking water in favor of soda, was played, sparking varied listener reactions.  Listener calls followed, with one caller threatening self-tazing and another delivering an incoherent message.  A news story about a Chinese food worker stomping on garlic with their shoes was discussed.  A viral YouTube video of an emotional reaction to a Britney Spears performance was analyzed, with debate on its authenticity and listener comments read aloud.  A listener suggested a similar song, "Hell no to AZT."  The show plugged a web series with Jimmy Norton and Florentine, along with upcoming Philadelphia and Camden shows featuring Louis C.K. and Stephen Lynch as guests.  Jimmy Norton's eclectic music taste was discussed, touching upon Kanye West's VMA outburst and further listener calls about music preferences and Bob Marley.


The broadcast then played comedic audio bits: "Kid Rock'em Sock'em," "Hell No to H2O," and a graphic Rockstar Energy Drink rap from a Lexington, Kentucky radio show detailing explicit sexual encounters.  The hosts discussed these bits and YouTube content, including a "Hey There Delilah" parody.  In-studio guests Stephen Lynch and Louis C.K. joined.  Louis C.K. recounted a humorous anecdote about his daughter's school morning struggles, bringing her backpack to the studio instead of school.  The contents of the backpack, his wife's struggles, and returning the backpack were discussed, referencing staff member Pat Duffy.  Louis C.K.'s birthday, past experiences, a pi√±ata incident, and gifts (a pen) were discussed, segueing into a humorous discussion of donkey and horse mating.  The conversation branched into tangents: the Russian space program's disregard for human life, the Russian government and Putin's power, and a lengthy discussion of the iPhone's limitations and Steve Jobs' shortcomings.  Numerous vulgar and offensive jokes were made throughout.


The show continued with a caller's scathing critique of the original iPhone, comparing it to predictions in the 1967 film "1999 AD."  The caller recounted a confrontation with a Steve Jobs representative.  The discussion included criticism of the iPhone's design and functionality and a humorous contrast between the film's predictions and reality.  The segment included discussion of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Billy Bob Thornton.  Crude and offensive humor, including homophobic and misogynistic language, was prevalent. A K-Rock phone contest went awry, leading to a chaotic and vulgar exchange with a caller trying to win Foo Fighters tickets.  Stephen Lynch and Louis C.K. were again mentioned as in-studio guests.


The broadcast included a lengthy, vulgar interaction with a caller named Andre.  The hosts engaged Andre in increasingly offensive and sexually explicit jokes and pranks, employing homophobic and misogynistic language, repeatedly claiming to have "pwned" him.  Fabricated phone lines (cum sniffer, gay men's hotline) and insults were used.  They jokingly offered him a baggie containing Eddie Van Halen's tongue.  The segment lasted about 20 minutes, mocking Andre's frustration and technical difficulties.  Listener-submitted lines of the day were discussed, focusing on crude jokes and insults, including homophobic slurs.  A potential Led Zeppelin reunion and other topics were briefly mentioned.  The show plugged websites like MrBaconPants.com and Meatspin.com, mentioning Stephen Lynch's upcoming performance.  The show concluded with a humorous song about menstruation.  Opie, Anthony, and E-Rock (the board operator) were identified as being in-studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like, you're the I-man, I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now!  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  that he's very, very depressed 
[00:01:00]  because his refrigerator door fell off.  It made a break for Ovi and Anthony.  Stupid Australians whose national hero  got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Morning.  Morning.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  How annoying is that?  This goes off.  Morning.  Hi.  Morning.  We like that personal touch with our show,  so we got to say hi to everybody.  Hi.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Just figure out which high is for you, by the way. 
[00:02:00]  And don't acknowledge all the highs.  Just one of these highs.  High.  High.  High.  High.  Morning.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  And good morning to Trish.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  High.  Ah.  Ah, nudity first thing in the morning. 
[00:02:30]  Isn't that nice?  Parade for nudity.  Some people think, um, some people think Whip Em Out Wednesday's kind of dead.  It really isn't, first of all.  But they like to discuss that.  I know it's alive and well on Pal Talk every morning, especially on Wednesdays.  The girls acknowledge that it is Whip Em Out Wednesday, and they're more topless than usual.  Yeah.  How great is that?  It's a great thing.  There it is. 
[00:03:00]  You get to see girls getting ready for work.  Nothing hotter than girls in their room getting ready for work and whatever else they're doing.  And I think this is where I differ from Jimmy.  I think this is so much hotter than watching porno.  So much hotter to me.  Well, I think it's hard, this is hard because I know these girls, they're friends.  Right.  So seeing your friends with no top on.  Want me to take my shirt off, Jim?  I'm your friend.  You are. 
[00:03:30]  You are.  Something's being lost in the translation.  Oh.  Oh, I thought you just meant friends.  In some, yeah, no, just, uh, it is very sexy to see, like, uh, you know, baby girl just kind of making her bed.  Making her bed.  Normal girl things with her hiney showing.  And her thong.  Very nice.  Her tee back.  Yeah, Rocco.  Yeah, wearing a tee back.  Shut up.  In honor of Rocco.  An old jock we used to work with.  Dude, she's got a tee back. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Rock hole.  Rock.  And it was supposed to be as awful as it sounded, Jimmy.  That's about all he did.  Those sketches that were on the, on the Demental World, it could be the worst thing I've ever heard anybody do.  Let me tell you, we're going to be out tonight in Worcester looking at some chicks and tee backs.  Ladies, make sure you're wearing your tee backs.  I'm going to the city tonight.  Boston?  No, Worcester.  Worcester is my city. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  Got you.  Nothing against Worcester, but, you know, when you're doing radio up there, yeah, you want to go to Boston.  You don't want to go to Worcester.  Boston.  Oops.  Somebody's having a problem with some swastikas.  Oh, boy.  On their fences.  Oh, boy.  Cheap.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  How come they can show that?  But they would never show the N-word.  They just showed, like, a spray-painted thing, some anti-Semitic spray painting.  And one said, like, cheap Jews rot in hell. 
[00:05:00]  And they showed it.  Nothing was blurred out or anything.  But if the N-word was up there, oof.  They wouldn't show that.  Then there would be a problem.  Now, the Jews are much more tolerant.  Hi, Jews.  Happy holidays this evening.  What is it?  Rosh Hashanah.  Rosh Hashanah.  Rosh Hashanah?  Rosh Hashanah.  What does that mean?  That means they got to be home by, like, seven-something tonight.  What?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  They got to get home by, like, seven-something tonight.  Why?  Because they got to get home.  I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  You're not allowed to be out.  And what happens if you're stuck in a traffic jam?  You can't be.  That's why there was a lot of traffic this morning.  I think a lot of the Jews drove in early so they could get a lot of stuff done before they have to leave.  All right.  Here's the scenario.  Okay.  And you play God or?  All right.  Do they have a God?  Of course.  I don't know this stuff.  All right.  So they have to be home before what?  Sunset?  Yeah.  Okay.  So they're doing their normal commute.  They even leave about an hour early just in case. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Okay.  Car breaks down, blows up, and there's a huge crater in the highway.  Okay.  You are not going to get home before sunset.  What happens to you?  I got you.  You ever see Blade?  No.  Vampire movie?  No, I did not.  They turn to a black, ashy dust and just blow away in the wind.  It's horrific.  But is that good or bad?  Oh, it's terrible.  Do they get a pass or not?  No.  No pass.  No pass.  You got to get home.  Really?  The Jews must get home. 
[00:06:30]  But what if you can't get home?  You're going to be in trouble.  With who?  With God.  And you got to atone.  God doesn't take traffic problems into consideration?  No.  Oh, God's thinking is like thousands of years old.  He doesn't care what man has wrought upon himself, what problems man has wrought.  It's your job to get your Jewish buttocks home by sundown. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  So that's what we'll be looking at today.  So happy Rosh Hashanah.  Will there be blowing of the ram's horn today?  The chauffeur.  It's called the chauffeur.  I know it's a ram's horn.  You must blow the chauffeur on the Rosh Hashanah.  What kind of blowing of the ram's horn do you do?  Is it a melody? 
[00:07:30]  No, I think you just got to...  You don't try to get it.  You don't try to get a tune out of that thing.  That sounds like a chauffeur.  Chauffeur.  I would say chauffeur.  Chauffeur-y.  What's up, Jimmy?  I don't know what you're talking about.  We're talking about the Jews.  We're trying to relate to the Jews.  And their holidays.  But I don't know what the horn is.  I have no idea.  It's a ram's horn.  And you have to blow into it like this.  No.  I didn't just...  See how things get twisted around. 
[00:08:00]  What happened?  I did not just refer to Jews as blood-sucking vampires.  You kind of did.  I said that if they don't get home in time,  if you've ever seen the movie Blade or any vampire movie,  they kind of just burst into flames a little bit  and then turn into ash and blow away.  Right.  Because God is very unforgiving.  God is not very forgiving.  Especially to the Jewish people.  Look what happened to Moses. 
[00:08:30]  The guy went all out to help his people.  Did everything.  And what happened to him in the end?  They trekked through the desert for quite some time.  Yeah.  And then God wouldn't let him in the promised land.  So what happened to Moses?  He just had to sit outside.  And what?  Panhandle?  Well, whatever he did, I'm not sure because I'm not Jewish,  but I know damn well that God didn't let him in  because of some mistake he made ages ago. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Let's all blow into the shofar.  All right.  Pick up your shofar, Jimmy.  I got mine.  That's not a shofar.  It's a wacky shofar.  Jimmy.  I'd rather...  Jimmy.  Do it.  That doesn't sound like one.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  And play the music so it sounds even better.  Oh, I got music.  I got music.  I got music.  I got music.  When are we supposed to blow into the shofar?  I think they do that when they get home.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Damn you, God.  Damn you, merciless God.  I tricked our people.  I freed our people from the binds of Egypt  and walked them through the desert 
[00:10:00]  and I couldn't even get a backstage pass.  God told me,  no, you didn't bring your laminate.  Merciless God with dry hair.  You judge us, God.  You judge us.  I did your work.  And what did you do?  You didn't let me in.  Why didn't they let him in?  It was some indiscretion.  What was it, Dan?  You're a theologist, aren't you? 
[00:10:30]  I just assumed you're really smart.  I don't know.  He did something.  We'll find out the answer sometime this morning.  Could it have been breaking the first tablets  when he threw them at the people  for making the golden idol?  Could it have been his sin of pride  for believing that he was the head muckety-muck  and look at me,  I'm leading my people out of Egypt  instead of actually, you know, God doing it?  Why didn't God let Moses in?  Oh, you got it?  I'm going to raise my hand.  All right.  Let me choose one. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe over here, over here.  I know, but you're always going to raise your hand.  I'm looking for a student  that barely ever raises their hand  because that's what teachers do.  Those bastards.  Okay, Opie.  I believe that he was playing oopsie with his robe.  Wasn't playing.  I think he was playing the whole oopsie game.  He was not playing oopsie.  On this holy day,  I don't think you should talk about Moses playing oopsie.  I think I know.  Oh, Jimmy Norton?  It was time to blow the shofar. 
[00:11:30]  The shofar.  Did you say blow the shofar?  Yes.  He did not enter the land of Israel  as he disobeyed God  when God instructed him  on how to bring forth water  from a rock in the desert?  What?  You gotta be crapping me.  You gotta be.  Are you kidding?  Wait, God taught him  or gave him instructions  on how to get water from a rock 
[00:12:00]  and he blew that off?  Well, then he didn't deserve to get in.  That's a handy trick.  We got actual sounds of the shofar.  Oh.  I was pretty close  and I've never heard this before.  What was that?  I swear to God,  I've never heard this before.  What was that?  That's the blowing of the shofar.  I was pretty close.  It is.  Listen to this thing.  Listen to this thing.  Can we have some music? 
[00:12:30]  And the Lord did then speaketh  to Moses  as he cast him out of Israel  and he said,  Damn!  You've just been pwned.  Oosh.  Hey, Mike in Illinois.  Speaking of blanking, 
[00:13:00]  let's just say,  and owes me,  I read my AT&T contract  not just once,  but twice.  Not beforehand.  Hoping for a blank.  He held off from Pal Talk.  Well, you gotta linger longer  to understand that.  Linger longer.  Here, I want to play  a little bit of the  blowing of the shofar.  Okay. 
[00:13:30]  A little cough at the end of that.  Ooh, that reminds me of something.  That reminds me of something.  Let me...  Please.  These are all  differential fears.  I got one too. 
[00:14:00]  Boozy, boozy,  bah,  bah.  I like to make  well-wolf movies.  My favorite clip so far.  I like to make  well-wolf movies.  Movies.  I am the werewolf.  Yes, you are.  Wait, wait.  I understand.  All right,  we're gonna do a little...  You're the werewolf.  I understand.  And he likes to make  those movies.  Let's do a little  mixy mix here.  Well,  well,  movie. 
[00:14:30]  I am the werewolf.  I like to make  werewolf movies.  There is no God.  Yes.  Damn.  Damn.  You just been pwned.  Yeah.  Oosh.  Does this make any sense to anybody?  I don't know.  I guess it's time to announce 
[00:15:00]  that this is...  Love that.  Can't say that Wednesday.  Can't say that.  And, of course,  it's whip them out Wednesday  as well today.  So, ladies,  what do you say?  What do you say  for old times' sake?  Your flesh.  Yeah.  Those boobies.  For old times' sake.  Are we giving out...  Sorry, Sal.  Are we giving out  the new  WOW stickers  here in New York?  I don't know.  It is really confusing  out there  with the WOW stickers.  I was driving  all over Long Island.  I'll say it again.  I saw  WNEW WOW stickers. 
[00:15:30]  I saw  Free FM WOW stickers.  I saw  the new  K-Rock WOW stickers.  Yep.  And, of course,  the XM Satellite Radio  WOW stickers.  Yep.  All in the New York market.  If that's not confusing everybody.  It's a smorgasbord  of stickers.  If you didn't know  any better,  you would just think  there's four  or five  different radio shows  doing  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  It's like a franchise.  That's what we do.  We franchise out 
[00:16:00]  WOW to other shows.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  Hey, more nudity  on Pal Talk.  It is Whip About Wednesday.  Where are we looking?  Let me see.  Flight benefits is...  I just clicked on there.  Oh, yeah.  Wakey, wakey,  flight benefits.  Whoa!  There she goes.  Wakey, wakey.  She is awake.  Looks good.  She sure is awake.  There it is.  Little black  boy shorty type  panties, 
[00:16:30]  nothing else  but a little bit  of sheet  on her leg.  Yeah.  I meant,  you know,  that type.  I'm not just trying  to put a funny accent  on a word.  Yeah.  It's an actual  sheet from a bed.  She wasn't hanging out  with some pervert.  Hey, Joe from Jersey,  he writes,  okay, a-holes,  I'm awake and out of bed.  Enough with the horrendous sound.  I can just imagine,  like,  there's a bunch of people  right now  with their hair  just askew  sitting on the edge  of the bed  going,  what was that?  They just fell out of bed. 
[00:17:00]  What was that?  Oh, if you want  to be woken up nicely,  go listen to Scott and Todd.  Right.  They'll lull you awake  and then lull you back  to sleep  for the rest of the show.  They got the big get,  though.  They got Billy Bob Thornton  today.  I'll give them a plug.  Really?  We got Stifler.  Stifler was good.  He rocked.  I would like to have  Billy Bob Thornton.  Right.  But that's the type  of show we are.  What show is he on,  Billy Bob Thornton?  Billy Bob's going to be  on Scott and Todd.  We get Stifler.  And the whole guest  thing yesterday. 
[00:17:30]  All promoting Mr. Woodcock.  That was emailed  back and forth.  I refused to answer.  Oh, I got the emails.  I got them.  I just refused to answer  because that movie,  that Western,  310 to Yuma,  which has such an easy  name to remember.  310.  I got to remember  what time it is.  310 to Yuma.  Christian Bale is in that.  Why not just call it  one of my favorite actors  in recent history. 
[00:18:00]  Christian Bale is great.  The machinist.  The machinist.  The machinist was amazing.  Everything the guy's been in  has been really good.  Even as Batman.  Yeah.  Doing a good job as Batman.  And then, of course,  Gladiator's in it, too.  Mr. Throw the Phone at people.  Russell Crowe.  Russell Crowe.  Yeah.  Russell Crowe's in it.  He's good.  He's good.  I wanted either of those  would have been, like, amazing.  For what movie?  For 410 out of Yuma.  Can't they just call it 
[00:18:30]  gunfight?  I don't know what it is.  At the Yuma Corral?  Yeah.  Just call it gunfight.  It's the 425 out of Jamaica's.  Jamaica's.  What a long call for everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's what I'll call it.  But we got offered a name.  And I'm reading the name.  And I don't recognize the name.  Now, I don't know what it does  in this movie.  Foster.  Ben Foster.  Ben Foster.  Oh, right.  Ben Foster?  Ben Falls 5 was going to be in.  Yeah, Ben Foster. 
[00:19:00]  And what he did.  Shut up.  Because you don't know him.  No.  Oh, Jimmy puts his fake acting face on.  No.  You know what?  I didn't know him either  until I realized  he was the effeminate  angel-winged guy  in X-Men 3.  I don't care.  Wow.  Calm down.  Sorry.  You calm down over there.  But I don't care.  I didn't care about it.  I'm sure he's a fine gentleman.  You don't care?  But as far as that movie goes, 
[00:19:30]  I want either Russell Crowe  or Christian Bale  to talk about that movie.  Not the guy with the wings  that was in two seconds  of X-Men 3.  You don't care, though, right?  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  He don't care.  I don't care. 
[00:20:00]  You know when you say  I don't care,  it really means you care.  It really means you care.  Everyone knows that by now.  But if I cared,  I could have emailed  and said,  yeah, get him on.  If you didn't care,  you wouldn't have even  brought it up.  I cared that we didn't get  Russell Crowe  or Christian Bale.  Right.  And we get the guy  that was probably  the dumbest mutant  in X-Men history.  The dumbest mutant  and the one that was in  for two seconds  in X-Men 3.  First of all, 
[00:20:30]  he didn't even play himself  the whole movie.  First, the kid was there  filing the wings off.  And then they're going  to give him the shot  and he flies out the window.  And then he picks up  his dad when his dad  flies out the window.  And then at the end,  he flies past the bridge.  He's just flying  for two seconds.  It's CGI him.  I don't care.  I don't care.  What?  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  More important, Robin.  I don't care.  Well, we don't know  if that's true.  I'm saying it is. 
[00:21:00]  Screw it.  Wait, wait.  Screw everything.  Is Billy Bob going  into Scott and Todd  or calling in?  I don't know.  Because I'm saying  sometimes they do  those things  where they answer questions  and you can just kind of  dub your own questions.  Why don't we get those  from big celebrities  talking about a movie  and then we're the guys  that dub in our own questions?  Know who did that gag  and pulled it off like  Rocco  and pulled it off  like he really was  talking to the people?  For the people out there,  we're going to tear down  another wall.  You will get this interview  from a big, huge celebrity  and then you cut out 
[00:21:30]  the interviewer  asking the questions  and you put your own  dopey voice in there.  So how was it  Man Cow used to do that?  Working with De Niro  and then the person  would go,  oh, Robert De Niro  is fantastic  because they did  an interview  and then you just  cut out the person  that did the original  interview.  Yeah.  You get a list  of the questions  and the answers  and you put it  in your own style.  Man Cow used to do that.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's another radio trick.  That's great.  Another radio trick  because then the listener  is like,  wow, I'm listening  to a pretty cool show. 
[00:22:00]  This guy gets  a lot of big guests.  Why don't we get those?  And then we'll just  add in stupid questions  that don't make sense.  Of course we will.  Let's try to do that.  Try to get our hands  on some of those.  Is there any way  we could get an exclusive  interview today  with somebody?  With somebody.  Look at Jill TV.  See, they get the big stars.  Get an interview  from Jill TV.  We'll cut it up  and we'll make  our own interview.  And no matter how bad  we get,  for some reason  they never hang up.  Right.  Or leave.  All right.  Or somebody.  Good luck.  Find something on the internet. 
[00:22:30]  I don't care if the audio sucks  and then we'll  dub in the questions.  All right.  We got to get going here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Girls,  if you see the WOW stickers  out there,  those guys are hoping  for a little something something.  Just a little  oopsie  or a little flash.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got the bumper stickers  out there.  WOW stands for  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We all know that.  You got the homemade signs.  You got the WOW written  in the dirt 
[00:23:00]  in the back of the trucks  and stuff.  So help us out.  All right?  All right.  And once again,  we are going to Philly  right after today's show  to broadcast live  Thursday and Friday.  I would love to let you guys  know what we're going  to be doing in Philly  but I got pages  and pages of stuff.  Pages.  We have a presidential  itinerary for Philly.  Yeah.  We are getting in there  and we will not be done  with doing anything.  We won't have two minutes 
[00:23:30]  to rest.  I know we're doing  our show live  from YSP tomorrow.  I know they're going  to have the YSP  ONA Cafe  so you can come in  and watch us  do the show live.  And then I know  we're going to a  Phillies game  tomorrow night  with some of our  listeners  that will be giving  away those tickets.  Then we head over  to the TLA  on Friday.  That's the big get  on South Street.  We're going to have  I think $1,000  to give away.  I think we're going  to have Eagles  Monday Night Football  tickets to give away.

[00:24:00]  Comedy Show  as we do  Car Crash Comedy.  Then we're going  to meet with clients  and then we do  the big comedy show  Saturday from Camden.  But I think there's  a lot more  in there.

I actually forwarded it  to my girlfriend.  I'm like,  do you understand  what a psychopath  Kenny is?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Pick up.  Open door for GH. 
[00:24:30]  He's just out of his mind.  He really is  out of his mind.  All right,  we got to take a break.  We're going to say  good morning to Buffalo  and, of course,  good morning to Boston.  We got a lot of  interesting stories  happening today.  Boston.  And then the I Miss Thing.  Cheaters.  And what?  Cheating cheaters.  You're calling them  What?  You're calling them  cheaters?  Yeah.  I say they're brilliant.  I love cheating.  Okay,  Mr. Push-ups. 
[00:25:00]  I'm a big fan  of cheating.  Huge.  Always have.  Yeah.  Always have and always will.  All right.  Big fan of cheating.  We'll get into that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.

Stephen S.  from Bayshore  has a new bit.  It's really simple.  He sees when Tom comes in  and say hi to us  every morning.  Yeah.  Tom, the GM here  in New York City. 
[00:26:00]  Kind of oversees  the whole operation  as far as our  regular radio careers go.  Yeah.  And Stephen S.  takes a note  of what Tom's wearing  and then comments  about it on Instant  Oh yeah,  because he can see it  on Pal Talk.  He's done a few of these.  Stephen S.  from Bayshore  writes,  This morning Tom's  wearing a tie  from the Larry Craig  collection.  I hear he's also  wearing tap shoes.  We do have the  greatest listeners  in radio, man. 
[00:26:30]  They give us a lot.  A lot of stuff.  Oh yeah.  Makes our jobs  a lot easier.  All right.  Time to pick up  your scorecards.  As you know by now  every day has themes.  Too many.  Today it's  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We've been doing that  for well over 10 years.  12 years.  Oh, like 50 years now.  Oh my God.  At least 12 years.  That one stays.  But if you're  keeping track at home,  I hate to say it,  Jimmy,  but say goodbye 
[00:27:00]  to Butt Rub Wednesday.  Say goodbye  to Butt Rub Wednesday.  Adios,  Butt Rub Wednesday.  Also,  say goodbye  officially  to  Cat Noise Wednesday.  Cat Noise Wednesday,  gone.  So long,  Cat Noise Wednesday.  We hardly knew ye.  We're still doing  Can't Say That Wednesday.  Yeah.  Or you Can't Say That Wednesday.  Yeah.  Occasionally.  And we're adding  a new one today.  Mm-hmm.  Morning Zoo  Bit of the Day  Wednesday. 
[00:27:30]  Morning Zoo  Bit of the Day  Wednesday.  Damn.  Now this,  is this self-explanatory?  It's all in the name,  right?  Well,  it started because  the emails were flying  yesterday after the show.  Everyone's talking  about the Moose Show  in the back office.  The Moose Show.  And I guess he replaced  Man Cow in Des Moines,  Iowa?  Wow.  Are you kidding?  Is it an actual moose?  Is it the Moose Show? 
[00:28:00]  Man,  if a radio station  had the balls  to just put a moose  on the air?  That would be great.  Who's not listening  every day?  Who's not listening  to the moose?  I think today  he might actually  say something.  And occasionally  you just hear,  meh.  And it's antlers  hitting the mic.  Yeah,  he's eating.  He's eating the mic.  That's right.  It's Morning Zoo  Bit of the Day Wednesday.  Yeah.  The guys are in  the back office  as we speak  digging for those 
[00:28:30]  fine Morning Zoo Bits.  Great.  Oh,  and we'll give  the show credit  and everything.  Oh,  good.  Gee,  I hope you don't  chase people away  and send them over  to those shows  because these are  so great.  these obviously  come up with  some kind of service  or do they make  them themselves?  A lot of them  come from a service  and then the show  plays them,  make them believe  it's theirs.  Yeah,  so then their listeners  think they're listening  to brilliant broadcasters.  Do they?  And then some 
[00:29:00]  of the Morning Zoos  will actually try  to make their own.  And I believe  the Moose Show  might have made this one.  The Moose Show?  Yeah.  It's called  the Kid Rock'em Sock'em.  Oh,  now that must be  because a Kid Rock  got punched.  Yeah.  Or actually punched  Tommy Lee.  Kid Rock'em Sock'em.  I getcha.  See,  get it?  Kid Rock'em Sock'em.  And then Rock'em Sock'em  like Rock'em Sock'em Robots.  Right.  Oh boy,  Jesus.  And if you guys 
[00:29:30]  want to...  The name alone sucks.  If you guys want to  send us a bit  from your local  Morning Zoo show,  we'd greatly appreciate it.  Oh,  please.  So we can feature  your city,  your town.  Oh,  Morning Zoo  bit of the day  Wednesday.  Morning Zoo  bit of the day Wednesday.  See,  I gotta still read it  because it's a little long.  Very long.  A little long.  I wonder how long  it's gonna take  before we actually  have a little promo  for that.  Well,  let me help out Tim.  Morning Zoo  bit of the day  Wednesday. 
[00:30:00]  All right?  Yeah.  No,  actually,  Tim is working  on our fake interview.  Yes.  Thank God.  Somebody has to.  So our listeners  could think  we're a hot shot  and we get  all the big stars.  Yes.  We're working  on our fake interview  in the other studio.  So are you guys  ready for the  Kid Rock'em Sock'em  from the Moose Show?  Please don't leave me  hanging.  All right,  here we go.  It's Morning Zoo  bit of the day Wednesday.  Here is your  Morning Zoo bit. 
[00:30:30]  New from Trailer  Toys Incorporated.  Just in time  for Christmas.  The Kid Rock'em Sock'em  Robot.  Look out,  Tommy Lee.  This Kid Rock'em Sock'em  is going platinum  on your face.  Realistic Kid Rock  action.  Greasy wife beater  t-shirt.  Dirty looking goatee.  And more.  Fresh off  his Video Music  Awards battle  with Tommy Lee.  You can bring  Kid Rock home  to kick some ass.  And now for our  special prize.  Warning,  this toy is being 
[00:31:00]  recalled due to  lead paint  and hepatitis  concerns from  its Chinese factory.  Do not play  with this toy.  Immediately return  to Kid Rock'em Sock'em  Robot to place  a purchase.  Unless you're  Pam Anderson.  Damn!  And there you have it.  Your Morning Zoo  bit of the day.  You got it right.  There it is.  Yes or no.  Oh, you added 
[00:31:30]  an extra E.  Oosh!  I like to make  werewolf movies.  Wow.  Hold on.  Yeah.  That, uh...  That, uh...  Dude, I'm being  honest.  I gotta be honest.  That wasn't  even remotely 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I thought you were  gonna say that wasn't  that bad.  Entertaining.  No, that's why we're  doing it.  Oh, no, I understand  why we're doing it.  See, we gotta tear down  another wall here.  We're playing this stuff  to show you how awful  this stuff is.  I think they are.  Hopefully people  understand that.  Huh?  Hopefully they got that.  Yeah, I would hope so.  They thought we were  playing that, like,  for Laugh Getter.  Folks, pull over first.  I'm gonna put this  over here.  I think we need to  play that again.  What does going  platinum on your face  mean?  Well, because, you know,  one of his most 
[00:32:30]  famous songs, he goes,  going platinum!  Yeah, but what does  that mean, like,  on your face?  Oh, yeah.  I don't get it.  You're right.  Oh, is that awful?  It's like going  ballistic, I guess,  meaning, like, I'm  going platinum.  It somehow becomes  this aggressive thing.  Yeah.  Your face is where  I'm gonna do it.  Okay, Jimmy,  I actually may have  explained it.  But you shouldn't  have to explain  your morning zoo bit.  I guess it's taking it  to the nth degree. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I like when people  say that.  Yeah.  The nth degree.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed  that I did that.  Yeah.  That was the moose.  Nate Sachs saying,  morning zoo bit of the  day, soon to be known  as the shortest  lived bit on O&A.  Yeah, please.  No, I kind of like  this bit.  You like it?  I kind of like it,  yeah.  All right, let's move  into some things.  God bless the Patriots.  And this is coming  from a Jets fan.  I love when people  cheat. 
[00:33:30]  This is blatant.  Cheating, breaking  the rubles, using  an illegal advantage.  I was a rule breaker  all through school.  And the Pats doing it  is like, come on.  You know, you're not  a good enough team.  You haven't seen  your fair share of  Super Bowls and  championships.  You got to cheat  in your first game.  Maybe they're just  bored and they're  coming up with new 
[00:34:00]  ways to excite  themselves.  Yeah.  No, it's called  cheating.  I bet that's how  they won those  games.  It's dishonest.  Exactly, because  this isn't the first  time this fat  cameraman has done  this for the team.  How Patriots stole  signals from the Jets.  Here we go.  Patriots video  assistant Matt  Estrella taped the  Jets defensive  coach's hand signals  as he sent the  defense onto the  field.  Estrella would say  what down and where  on the field the Jets  were so the camera  picked it up.  When the tape is  analyzed, the hand  signals are matched  up to Estrella's  comments and  defensive scheme.  This would allow a 
[00:34:30]  Patriots player on the  field to be able to  look over at the  Jets' sideline and  steal the signal and  tell the quarterback  Tom Brady what  defensive scheme the  Jets were going to  use.  Oh, God, I'll tell  you, though.  How great is that?  It's cheating and  everyone's involved.  Right up to Richard  Nixon.  Oh, sorry.  He's dead.  Yeah.  This goes right to  the top.  Right to the top.  Everyone knows about  this.  So what's wrong with  that?  So the team should  be penalized and not 
[00:35:00]  just this little thing  like I'm hearing maybe  they won't get some  draft picks or  something.  They should be  forced to take that  as a loss.  Absolutely.  That is a loss.  Well, Jets win.  The Jets win.  They're saying do  over.  Do over.  Who yells do  over?  They're yelling do  over.  That is all over  cheating.  All over Staten  Island.  See, we took the  long way in today  and all over  Staten Island  they're saying do  over.  Do over.  Do over.  Do over.  That is, that 
[00:35:30]  should be like  huge suspensions  for some of the  management and  coaches.  The team should be  penalized.  They should have a  loss now and the  Jets should have a  win.  That game should be  a forfeit.  This is going to  turn into another  scandal.  See, every sport  needs a scandal.  And I'll tell you  why.  I bet you every  team does this.  Including the Jets.  They just didn't get  caught. 
[00:36:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Watch it.  Why would every  team do something  illegal like that?  In the coming days  it's going to come  out that a lot of  other teams have  been doing this.  That it's normal.  Of course.  Sonny Ferrelli from  Boston.  Okay about the Pats.  First of all, their  first drive in their  kickoff return had  nothing to do with  stealing calls so  you Jets fans go  F off you P's.  You know  something, Sonny?  Shut up.  Your Boston drips  off of you.  You're not  subjective at all. 
[00:36:30]  And then we got  John from D.C.  Is cheating off the  Jets really cheating?  It's like copying  algebra from a  mongoloid.  Sorry, right here  in some feedback,  John.  And yeah, that's  a good point.  How screwed did  the guy feel when  they took his  camera?  Like when they  took his video  camera away, he  was sitting there  going, oh my  God, everything's  on there.  Oh my God, all  the signals are  on there.  This is such  just blatant 
[00:37:00]  cheating.  Oh my God, they  got me.  I hope there's  also him having  sex with something  on that same  videotape.  Let's say hi to  Sonny calling all  the way from  Boston.  Sonny, what's  up?  You're representing  all of Boston  today.  How are you?  Hey, listen  guys, I want to  bring up some  points here.  First of all,  that first drive.  Oh, screw the  first drive.  Of course, we  saw the first  drive.  We're talking  about the rest  of the entire  rest of the  game, dummy.  Let's Sonny  speak.  The kickoff  return in the  second half, that  had nothing to 
[00:37:30]  do with play  calls being  stolen.  You're right, but  you still can't  cheat in your  court.  Yeah, so why  are they stealing  calls if they're  such a great team  that they're  running back  kickoffs the  length of the  field?  And I'm going  to give you  the 21 points,  the reason why  this game shouldn't  be brought back,  all right?  All right.  The pass that  Brady passed to  Moss in the  fourth quarter with  three defenders, what  does that have to  do with stealing  play calls?  Dude, they're cheating.  If you're sitting down  playing cards and 
[00:38:00]  you're cheating...  Hey, shut up!  Shut up a minute!  Shut up!  Let me make my  goddamn card point!  If you're sitting  down playing cards and  you're cheating, it  doesn't matter if you  won on legitimate  hands or not.  You're caught cheating.  You lose.  You get shot in the  head with a  Derringer.  That's what happens.  They were cheating.  I don't care how many  legitimate plays they  had that won the  game for them.  The game should be  turned because they  were cheating.  Sonny.  Oh, blow it out  your Boston ass. 
[00:38:30]  I hate the Jets,  dude.  I'm a cowboy fan.  I don't like the  Jets at all.  And I still think  that they should  have to lose that.  I think a lot of  teams have been  doing this, though.  I'm not a Jet fan.  A lot of teams have  been doing this.  I hate Boomer.  Can't you appreciate  like a card counter  in a casino?  That's not cheating.  Well, can you  appreciate a guy  that's, you know,  walking in with  all sorts of  electronics?  That's cheating.  I love that stuff.  I can't lie to you.  I love this type of  stuff when people 
[00:39:00]  attempt to cheat.  But that's great.  And if you make a  whole career of it  and make your way  through life and  never get caught,  no one ever knows.  You got caught.  Sorry.  I take it back to  school.  I was, I knew  very early on that  I was a pretty smart  kid and I got bored.  I got bored.  So I came up with  other ways to get  through class.  I was able to make  the tiniest cheat  sheet known to man.  It was as big as  why were you cheating  if you're so goddamn  smart?  Because it made it  more interesting.  It made it exciting.  School's a bore fest. 
[00:39:30]  My cheat sheets could  have...  Supposed to be.  My cheat sheets were  as small as my thumb.  So I could just put my  like my finger on the  desk and there was a  cheat sheet under my  thumb.  Hmm.  And that's what was  exciting.  Or I would put the  cheat sheets in the  urinals and excuse  myself in between the  tests.  The teachers fell for  that once.  How about just in your  pocket?  No, because it's tough  to go to your pocket  during an exam.  No, but I mean if  you're going to put it  in the urinal, like...  No, I had a extra 
[00:40:00]  copy there.  Oh, I had it all  figured out.  I had one that I was  brave enough to have  kind of on my thumb and  sometimes you're too  scared to lift that  thumb and go for it.  So then I had another  one in the urinals just  in case.  I had all sorts of  schemes going.  Oh, yeah.  And then when I went to  Geneseo, we were  stealing garbage and  finding tests.  Oh, they actually had  that?  Yeah.  Back in the day, yeah,  before the computers and  all that.  Because of the...  Mimeograph.  Because of the  mimeograph.  You need your  mimeograph. 
[00:40:30]  They would print up  their tests and throw  it in the garbage and I  had a nice business  going for me at  Geneseo.  Because we discovered  this and it got  exciting to see  steal the garbage  around exam time and  then maybe we would  figure out ways to get  in buildings.  I don't know.  Maybe.  To go through their  personal garbage  house.  You should steal your  diploma.  Oh, it's useless  anyway.  True.  A communication degree  from Geneseo?  Please.  What's that going to  get you? 
[00:41:00]  Please.  And then we'd go up  to the fraternity  house and we would  throw the garbage in  the basement and we  would dig through it  and we would find  exams like crazy in all  the sorority houses  and the fraternity  houses were calling  us asking if we had  certain exams and we  did and we were  giving them to them  for like a couple  hundred dollars a pop.  I thought that was  just an animal house.  I swear.  I started it and then  it went on for years.  Years.  Until they went to  the old computer and  that kind of wrecked  everything I guess.  Yeah.  It was a lot harder  to steal exams. 
[00:41:30]  Oh yeah.  So I kind of like the  cheating thing.  I don't know.  I like it.  I don't think it's  I think you're  you're alone there.  Yeah.  What are we looking  at then?  Just one of the  feedbacks I was  pointing.  Oh which one?  Which one?  Heyo how many  answers could you  write on one  marshmallow?  You had to point  that one out right?  That's funny.  But you also when  you were doing that  knew the penalty if  you got busted.  I didn't care.  It was just exciting. 
[00:42:00]  But you still did it  like knowing like okay  I got to be careful  because I got caught.  Right.  They wouldn't look at  and go all right  let's see what answers  are on your finger  and those questions  will be made invalid.  Your whole test is  ripped off.  Yeah.  Right.  And that's the way  it is for Boston.  So Sonny I'm not a  Jet fan but they  should take a big L.  Of course.  I say do.  We got to set an  example.  Just go with the  do over on a Tuesday.  A do over.  A do over on a  Tuesday afternoon.  I like to make  werewolf movies.  Oh.  I like to make  werewolf movies. 
[00:42:30]  Also we have to say  good morning to  Buffalo today.  everyone listening on  the edge.  Kevin Everett will  likely walk again.  They're calling this a  minor miracle.  You know the deal by  now right?  Of course.  Kevin Everett pretty  much went head first in  and was paralyzed.  Paralyzed.  Dropped to the ground  and they were saying  that it was life  threatening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They pretty much said  he was going to be  paralyzed.  Yeah.  And I guess overnight  he made miraculous  recovery or something.  And started moving his 
[00:43:00]  toes and his fingers.  He's got upper and  lower body movement.  And yes they are  calling it a miracle.  But I heard that on  the news on the way  in this morning.  And I was very happy  for him because you  never want to see that  happen.  But I don't see it as  much of a miracle as I  see it as one quack  doctor jumping the gun.  Who are the doctors  that are always saying  I'm sorry you're not  going to walk again.  And then the guy walks  and it's like it's a  miracle.  No it's a crappy 
[00:43:30]  doctor.  That said you weren't  going to walk.  Who would be great at  that job?  Kenny.  I'm sorry Kenny.  You're not going to  walk again.  It was a hangnail dummy.  Since I read that in  the paper I'm thinking  maybe the doctor should  give it a day or two  before they decide that  you're never going to  walk again.  Right.  Because that's pretty  heavy to digest.  They got these new  I don't even know what  it is but it's an  injection that they give  you right in the injury  steroids.  Yeah it's something  some type of steroid. 
[00:44:00]  They did that with  what's his name the  the jet player.  Dennis Blair.  Yeah.  If they get it within  like a couple of hours  of the injury it does a  good job of keeping the  the spine the spinal cord  from swelling up and  that's what does a lot of  the damage.  So it's helped a lot of  people.  I wonder if they used it  on him.  Or is it Dennis Bird?  I don't remember his  name.  Bird.  Wait who's Dennis Blair?  I think he's a comedian  that opens for Carla.  Okay yeah yeah Bird.  You're right.  Dennis Leary hurt his  back?  Yes. 
[00:44:30]  Dennis the menace is  probably.  Wasn't he supposed to  not walk again Dennis  Bird?  Yeah.  Now he does right?  Yeah.  Oh yeah he's doing  all right actually  considering they said  he wasn't going to  walk again.  So you're thinking  what it's the doctor's  fault and it's not a  minor miracle?  No.  Yeah I mean yeah  that's what I'm saying.  Did you read what they  did to this guy?  They were like repairing two  or three vertebrae and  all sorts of crap.  Well I'm not saying  medicine is a fantastic  thing.  That's why stupid  doctor shouldn't have  walked in and said  he's never going to  walk again before they  brought him off the 
[00:45:00]  field.  You're hearing that.  I was I saw CNN dot com  I look and I see the  picture of him laying on  the field and paralyzed  never going to walk  again.  Yeah.  Jesus they are making  some strides here.  Maybe Mr.  Doctor ought to keep his  mouth shut for a little  while.  So it doesn't look like a  miracle.  It looks like you know  it's what happened.  Yeah.  Medicine.  Love of God.  So that's very good news  coming out of Buffalo  man.  Very good news.  And Kenny would be  great.  Well it looks like you 
[00:45:30]  might walk again.  That would be like the  depressing part.  And the guy would go  that's great but you  won't run as fast.  You never play.  Really?  You spent your whole  life getting to the  NFL but you're never  going to play again.  You could end up  retarded.  All right.  Yeah we'll talk about  the Chinese food guy  after the break.  Oh man.  I will never eat a  Chinese food. 
[00:46:00]  Dude it's going on all  over the place.  You think?  Absolutely.  We'll explain what's  going on here in New  York.  The smells that just  walking into the into  this studio in the  morning.  I don't know how you  guys come in that  other entrance.  Because I come in one  entrance you come in  another.  I've come in that  other one occasionally  and it is truly like  a human being.  Coming in the front  here ain't too bad  but you guys come in  the back door and  boy does it stink. 
[00:46:30]  Oof.  Because there's a  restaurant over there.  Restaurant?  There's a few.  Many.  And they leave piles  of rotting food.  Right on the street.  Yeah it is kind of  it's more than gross.  It stinks.  Oh when you come  into the building  Roaches the size of  your shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah you step over  a few Roaches.  Homeless guy.  You know there's a  lot of fun out there.  Alright we'll explain  what's going on with  this Chinese food  worker after the  break.  And don't forget 
[00:47:00]  it's Morning Zoo  Bit of the Day  Wednesday.  I almost forgot.  Hopefully another one  on the way.  I sure hope so.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  Hey good morning to  everybody.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  Stephen has from  Bayshore again on  Instant Feedback.  Kenny is the doctor  talking to Everett.  Dr. Kenny.  At least you know  you'll be off on  Sundays from now on. 
[00:47:30]  With a big smile  on his face.  If you're just  tuning in you gotta  linger longer to  get some of these  some of these jokes.  Hey we got a  brand new missed  call.  One of our favorite  things on the Opie  and Anthony show.  My favorite of all  time so far is this  one.  Halfway rebound.  Score!  No.  No.  Oh my I'll tell you  something.  How does that not  go in?  I like his like  Scott no no.  He's like all mad at  the guy.  Hey.  Hey no.  You just wrecked my 
[00:48:00]  call.  Scott no no.  No.  He couldn't even get  out of the score  voice.  Yeah.  That goes Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's on the roll.  She's gone.  The milkman delivered.  Now what are they  saying?  What are they saying?  What am I saying?  What are they saying?  They're saying nothing.  You're the one saying.  You said it.  The milkman didn't  deliver.  That's the best part of  that is that idiot had  to get his own thing  out.  Yeah.  Did the milkman deliver? 
[00:48:30]  Stupid.  No apparently he missed  the house.  These are great.  No cereal this morning.  These are great because  they're so awkward.  What are they saying?  What are they saying?  You're the guy saying it.  That guy was a jackass.  Right.  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the  track.  He leaps at the wall and  it is gone.  It just cleared.  No.  What are they saying now?  They're saying it's a  double.  It went just under the  wall.  Under the wall.  Just under.  See how easily I could 
[00:49:00]  have made that mistake.  And once again what do  they say?  Well.  What are they saying?  Those people are idiots.  Here's the brand new one.  All right.  New one.  Where's E-Rock?  Get this one in my system  immediately.  Oh please.  Back goes Beltran.  Back to the warning  track.  Right near the wall.  Leaping.  And he made the catch.  Carlos Beltran.  Right.  No he didn't.  My apologies.  I thought he had it.  I thought he had it too.  He acted as though he had  it.  He did not have it. 
[00:49:30]  Oh now.  Now you're going to blame  it on good acting.  You know he acted like  he had it.  It's an Academy Award  winning performance of a  man having a ball.  Big Steve in Rochester.  What's up Big Steve?  What's up Big Steve?  What's up fellas?  Hey.  First of all I want to  say how long it takes to  get through to you guys.  It's been forever since  what I wanted to say.  Damn it.  We're kind of a popular  show.  Kind of.  What?  I think you wanted to  talk about cheating there  Big Steve. 
[00:50:00]  Oh dude.  Okay.  Okay.  So I'll be real quick  about it.  What we used to do  it sounds complicated.  Iraq whoever's running  the phones are like  wow that sounds kind of  crazy.  I don't know if I can  put that through.  Yeah you can.  Anyways.  What I was doing is I  would record.  We would get the test  or whatever.  We record what was  going on.  The answers.  What questions.  The answers to the  test.  I would put a tape  deck.  The old tape  Walkmans on your  side like I'm cool.  Like carrying a bunch  of pagers on the side  of my face.  Or dope.  And I would put the  play. 
[00:50:30]  Brian G.  Billy writes on  Instant Feedback.  It's called cutting  your losses.  Hey Ann on CNN  they're showing  bailiffs tasing a guy  in a wheelchair  in a courtroom.  The guy is strapped  in like Hannibal Lecter.  They're showing it  every five minutes.  Yeah.  Oh come on.  It is your video  of the day that you'll  be seeing sometime  today.  Fantastic.  Guys in a wheelchair  and.  Well the taser is one  of the best  entertainment tools  created in the past  I'd say 50 years. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  It is fantastic.  There is nothing.  There is no one  out there that does  not enjoy watching  someone get a good  tasering.  Well it's a man  in a wheelchair  and he's tased  after kicking  his own attorney.  Well.  How did he kick?  His legs are still  good.  Maybe he's just  one of those  old crotchety guys  that still move  his legs but he's  just too crotchety  to walk.  He kicked his own  attorney and they  tased him?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:51:30]  Alright here we go.  This video from  Columbus Ohio  captured inside a  courtroom by ATV  station.  The defendant  accused of holding  churchgoers at  gunpoint during a  robbery kicked his  defense attorney and  had to be tackled  by guards.  They used a taser  on him and he was  later removed from  the courtroom.  When he returned  he was in heavy  duty restraints but  even they didn't  subdue him.  Authorities  eventually returned  him to his cell.  I heard a little 
[00:52:00]  in the background.  We got isolated.  Yeah it's got to  hurt.  That's the guy in a  wheelchair getting  taped.  Is that great?  The video's pretty  good too so.  Alright.  Hey really fast it's  Morning Zoo bit of the  day Wednesday.  Yes.  And we're getting  help from the rest of  America.  We got Trey Taylor  looks like from  Kansas. 
[00:52:30]  The Rod Ryan show  in Houston would have  Tubes Day.  Tubes Day?  On Tuesday.  And what is that?  He'd drain someone's  tubes onto his face?  The stunt boy slash  producer has to talk  through a tube every  Tuesday and then he  writes yuck yuck yuck.  Hey I thought we did  that.  What?  Yeah but we did it  as a goof.  That's what I mean.  I hope people realize  what all these themes  we're coming up with  is to mock the rest  of radio.  Like did we do that 
[00:53:00]  at NEW?  We decided to just  talk into a tube all  day or something.  But it was.  But I don't think we.  Did we call it Tubes Day?  It was.  Are you kidding me?  It was a goof.  Of course it was.  Oh that's great.  Uh and well why don't  we do this.  It is Morning Zoo  Bit of the Day.  Yes.  I think we gotta  change the name  because we want to  play more than one  bit.  Morning Zoo.  Bits. 
[00:53:30]  Bits.  Oh god you're  brilliant Jim.  Bits of the Day.  B-I-T-Z.  Like uh.  And make the Z  backwards.  Yes.  Make the Z  backwards.  Yeah put the Z  kind of backwards  so it looks silly  and tilt it.  I did tilt it.  Nice.  Like uh.  Bits.  Bits.  Alright Jimmy can you  do it now?  What?  Just what it's  called.  Oh it's called uh  Morning Zoo Bits  of the Day.  Did you hear it  being turned around?  I did. 
[00:54:00]  And it's tilted.  Bits.  Steve-O uh from  Boston.  The god damn  Patriots are still  the best team.  Why doesn't somebody  go check the Colts?  They put up a lot  of points.  Oh they'll always  just sit and defend  everything.  Dude.  Please.  You know what?  If the Jets were  doing it we would  be defending the  Jets today.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:54:30]  But I wouldn't.  I'm not a Jet fan.  No.  Alright here we go.  I hate Boomer.  Uh.  Stupid jock.  Here's the next  Morning Zoo  bit of the day  as part of  Morning Zoo  bit of the day.  Morning Zoo  bit of the day.  It fizzles out  because you got to  turn around and make it  into a Z.  Or is it a Z and then  you turn around but then  wouldn't that be an  podcast?  Yeah.  Oh wow there's a  picture of me talking 
[00:55:00]  into a tube.  There's a picture of  you doing tubes day.  It's tubes day.  It's true.  What the hell is it?  Look and there's Oki  talking.  Hey.  Who ripped us off and  actually made a bit of it?  Well it's gotta be.  That's sad.  It's gotta be a long  time ago because that  shirt I gave to a  homeless guy.  God it's gotta be two  years ago.  And Anthony's dressed  like Tiny Tim for like  a Christmas story.  It's very chilly.  Wow.  Jeff from Staten Island  tell Boston to get over 
[00:55:30]  it.  They suck period.  We got a thing  happening.  You realize that right?  It's the whole country  against Boston.  That's pretty much what  it is.  Well Boston come on  let's go.  You're getting killed  here.  Guys are being silly.  That's what I love  about doing a  syndicated radio show.  You get to talk to all  the cities at the same  time.  So Boston's going at it  with Staten Island  today.  The state of Staten  Island.  Here's the next  morning zoo bit.  Excuse me?  It's called one of  one of the. 
[00:56:00]  Well no I'm not  saying the name.  I'm just saying  because now I got to  do it.  So it's like here's  another morning zoo.  I would go here's  another one of the  morning zoo bits.  It's another one of  the morning zoo bits.  It's kind of just  kind of.  Yeah.  You know when you  want to impress your  friends with a nice  fart and all of a  sudden it just.  Yeah.  That's how the name  is.  Morning zoo bits.  Bits.  It comes from Kevin 
[00:56:30]  and Virginia show on  wild 95.5.  Wild.  West Palm Palm Beach  Florida.  Oh okay.  This is called hell  no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Yeah.  That's water.  Yeah.  I think we need it.  Yeah.  To live.  Lock up your sons.  Lock up your daughters.  Death is on the street  and it is called water.  Water.  Water. 
[00:57:00]  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  It is an epidemic.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  H2O.  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Man it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O.  Gotta go when you serve that H2O.  Water so bad man it makes me choke.  So drop the bottle water and pick up a coke.  In my opinion.  If it was up to me.  The whole wild world would take a bath in Pepsi. 
[00:57:30]  Water is sleaze.  Causes disease.  More dangerous than killer bees.  Be so.  Man it's worse than murder.  Murder.  Murder.  You know it's overrated.  I'm talking about hydration.  Rather have a can full of carbonation.  So pick up a soda.  Don't be a coward.  Water is worse than milk that turns sour.  Everybody knows cola gives you power.  Water's only good for taking a shower.  Uh.  So now.  I must bow my head and pray. 
[00:58:00]  To the soda gods.  All up in soda heaven.  Tell me heaven is like 7-Eleven.  Mountain Dew, Coke, Sprite, and Sun Kiss.  Dr. Pepper, Pepsi, and Sierra Mist.  That's the kind of liquid I need in my life.  Wish I could legally make Mountain Dew my wife.  So this is a message across the land.  Say no to water.  And yes to soda cans.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  I'm gonna do it all day.  H2O.  It is an epidemic.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O. 
[00:58:30]  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Man, it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O.  Gotta go when you stir up that H2O.  It is an epidemic.  Dammit.  Dammit.  Uh.  Maybe this might be a bit of a day.  Well, that was pretty good.  That was pretty good.  Take off.  I'm reading it.  I'm reading some pal talk comments.  Please don't.  And one must have been a black guy because he just wrote, you effing white people. 
[00:59:00]  That sucks.  Painful to listen to.  Yeah.  It was funny, but I mean like.  What?  What?  Well, like heaven and it was like a guy wants to make mountains to his wife.  I mean, that's pretty good.  Can't marry soda, silly.  Shut up.  It's impossible.  Wow.  That's a guy who really doesn't like water, though.  Good God.  How much do you love soda, pal? 
[00:59:30]  Are they black guys?  Or white guys?  I don't know.  What are they?  I don't know.  They couldn't be black guys.  No, Kevin's white.  Virginia's white.  If a black guy tried to say that, his melanin would fall off.  Yeah.  Black people can't rap that badly.  It has to be us.  That was really bad.  Well, it's part of Morning Zoo.  I'm seeing that huge unit said, well, he's suggesting the only people that should really 
[01:00:00]  like or sing that song are the Yates children.  Oh, my God.  That guy, buddy, he was like naming sodas.  Yeah.  God, try some decaf, buddy.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, look at this one.  He's outrageous.  Yeah.  And no water.  We take all your medicine with soda, pal?  Easy, easy.  Okay, also.  Has he washed his face with Pepsi?  Also, Lacey and Connor Peterson should probably sing that song. 
[01:00:30]  But that's them and the Yates children.  Yeah.  And who are the other ones?  Susan Smith.  The old Susan Smith.  Yeah.  Back the van into a pool full of diet Shasta.  Jeff from Houston.  Morning Zoo bit of the day.  Another one coming in.  Howard Stern would have listeners wrap a bandana around their cars so chicks would flash their  boobies.  Yes.  We all know that. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, Bill from Waterford is just beating up Boston today.  Oh, it's updating too fast.  But he's basically saying F you to the mayor, F you to the big dig, F you to the bomb squad.  But then he gives them a compliment.  He goes, at least they segregate.  F you to airport security.  Right.  That's all from Bill from Waterford.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Jersey.  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, hello?  Hello.  Hi.  Hey, Glenn.  Yo, I have a taser. 
[01:01:30]  I'll do it.  Yo.  Hello?  Yeah.  I have a taser.  I'll taser myself right now.  Yeah?  Where are you?  I'm in my car because I'm a big C from Roger a couple of four.  God, you guys suck.  They let me through again.  Don't hang up, though.  Howard, I love you guys.  Jimmy Norton, you rule.  You guys are the only reason I go to work in the morning to listen to you motherfuckers.  Get someone to exchange your phones better. 
[01:02:00]  I'm the same guy.  I'm going to keep calling.  I don't know who he is, though.  But you say you're going to keep calling.  But we don't know who you are.  I don't even know who you are.  Only you.  Oh, you're the same.  I'm not that good.  I'm going to take my own.  But you're not good because we don't know who you are.  It's like this is like the first time you've called for us.  Yeah.  Like, so it's not like it's not like, oh, my God, he's so good.  Like, like, to be fair, like back in the day when you got the Baba Booey.  Oh, wow.  They got us again.  But who's Steve from Rochester? 
[01:02:30]  I love everyone.  I'm not going to tase myself.  I haven't slept yet because I wanted to.  No, we understand you're not going to tase yourself, but the guy wasn't even.  We really don't know what that was about.  I don't either.  I get it.  So annoyed with people sometimes.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm right there with you if you pull a fast one.  That's, you know, oh, you got us.  But that guy's like, call up a radio show for the first time and then blurt something  around and go, oh, I got you.  Oh, boy.  Jeez.  The square.  Oh, you got to screen the calls better.  Right.  Well. 
[01:03:00]  Sounds like a soda drinker to me.  Yeah.  Hey.  Easy.  A little water.  Oh, gosh.  Jimmy.  Incorrigible.  That's a lot of calories.  You know.  I hope you're having some diet, pal.  Oh, no.  What are you, what are you, what are you, what are you, crazy?  You wash your hair with, uh, what?  Hey, no.  Hey, hey, Coca-Cola hair.  You know, you know, because water's bad.  Got no taste. 
[01:03:30]  They say it right in the song.  I think the morning zoo bits of the day might take off now, see?  See, you guys didn't like it 10 minutes ago now.  They're obsessed now.  We might be out to something.  Still don't like it.  It stinks.  Hey, we forgot about the Chinese food worker.  We'll do it after the break.  Look, that just means we got a busy show.  Philly, what's up?  We'll be there tomorrow and Friday.  Let's not forget.  Too many details to give.  And then the rest of the country goes, boring.  We're not in Philly.  So do us a favor.  Just keep listening to YSP.  Kid Chris and the gang, they'll let you know about our visit starting tomorrow. 
[01:04:00]  Live from YSP Studios.  Right.  Building up to the big comedy show.  The last one we're going to do for a while.  Yeah.  In Camden this Saturday night.  Eight or nine comedians you know and love from the show.  Matter of fact, Louis C.K. coming in to pump up the show a little bit.  That's coming up Saturday.  Oh, good.  And I think Stephen Lynch is coming in.  Oh, Lynch is on the show, right?  I believe so.  And I believe he's coming in to do a song or two.  Excellent.  So.  Cool.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony and a little Jimmy Norton. 
[01:04:30]  I want to throw out a quick, I asked Tom already, just something me and Florentine did.  I just want to plug because the superdeluxe.com, we're on the front page, a bunch of little  newscaster things.  Oh, yeah.  You know, so I just wanted to throw it out because the guy was really nice who we did that  for.  What is it though, Jimmy?  What is it?  We do this little series called Good Side of Bad News.  We play these two newscasters and it's shot kind of weird because we only had one monitor.  So like if it's on us, if it's showing two of us, it looks normal. 
[01:05:00]  But if it shows one of us, we're looking off to the side.  Oh, off to the side a little bit.  So we look like creeps.  Yeah.  But it was.  How about two monitors?  That was just an error.  But it was.  It'll be fixed for next time, but it's kind of funny to watch because you see us talking  and then you see like the eyes diverted to the wrong direction.  That's creepy.  Two unprofessional idiots.  It's superdeluxe.com?  Yeah.  And the guy is really, really a sweet guy.  Love Florentine too.  I do too.  One of my favorite people.  Norton and Florentine on superdeluxe.com.  Yeah.  Check it out.  If you like it, you like it.  If not, you know.  Don't worry.  Screw you. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  It is an epidemic.  Hell no to H2O.  Jimmy loves this.  Hell no to H2O.  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Man, it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O.  Gotta go when you serve that H2O.  What are you going to do?  Leave the whole building?  You're crazy.  Come on.  Serving water.  I'm out of here, guys.  What are we going to do with the water cooler?  What are you going to talk about if there's no water cooler? 
[01:06:00]  Get a soda cooler, apparently.  These guys need to chill out a little bit.  A bit edgy, don't you think?  The FCC might be coming.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Easy, guys.  Slow down a bit.  You can't drive 55.  Oh, boy.  Chinese food worker.  Yeah, yeah.  This was...  Saw this on the news this morning. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, tasered guy?  In wheelchair.  Is this wheelchair tasered guy?  Yeah.  Oh, they stomping him on the head.  Oh, see?  Now he's mad.  The court officer got a little hit there.  Yeah.  So they got him in his restraints.  They tasered him.  Oh, my God.  They bring him in in a wheelchair.  What the hell?  He looks ridiculous.  How the F you going to treat me fair?  How to get a fair trial.  How to get a fair trial. 
[01:07:00]  This...  Oh, this guy looks ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  You got to make sure you check out this video sometime today.  That's a good one.  That's your video of the day.  They bring him back in with this white...  It looks like a white towel wrapped around his chin and head.  Almost like the Tin Man looked.  He's got a big jaw.  And he has almost like a black fishnet, a mosquito net over his head.  I don't know why they put the mosquito net.  Maybe so bugs don't land on him.  Yes.  He doesn't like mosquito bites.  What?  Oh, good.  Well, okay.  There you go.  Oh, they don't want him to spit. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  See, Kenny knows this stuff.  Of course he does.  Kenny knows.  Kenny knows.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Well, we saw something very disgusting.  Yeah, but what was...  Chinese food?  Yeah.  Ah, the wheelchair got me thinking of something.  Yeah, all right.  Let's just go to...  Oh, just really fast.  It's good to see that the local news is back to normal today.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All that doom and gloom yesterday.  Oh, now it's just about funny videos.  Look, here's an SUV running through a fence and...  At a high school football game.  At a high school football game. 
[01:08:00]  Ah, there you go.  Ah, we're all back to good news.  What is it?  Oh, it's September 12th.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Moving right along.  No more somber music.  Back to cleavage and bright attire on the local news.  But they cared so much yesterday.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  It was a mere day ago.  Up.  Up.  People.  Now we got the video of the guy getting tased in a wheelchair.  So things are back to normal.  Yep.  Yeah, Chinese food worker caught...  Should I tell Jimmy whether he was caught...  No, let me...  Okay.  I honestly don't know. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  I don't want to know.  I said food for thought that may be a little hard to swallow.  Food for thought, hard to swallow.  Come on, right there.  It's good.  You don't even have to play the rest of the story.  Wait.  It's a good one.  Food for thought.  Hard to swallow.  Hard to swallow.  That's fantastic.  Chew on this for a while.  Yes.  Is that a pun?  Yeah.  It'd be interesting who was destroying colon cancer.  Hope you're sitting down.  Easy way to...  Listen to her. 
[01:09:00]  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  It is an epidemic.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Man, it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O.  Gotta go when you serve that H2O.  Gotta go.  Well, if it's worse than cocaine...  Yeah.  But it's not because it doesn't have a taste.  So there's...  Yeah.  Why?  Well, yeah, I don't get it.  Like...  Hell no. 
[01:09:30]  Is this guy gonna fill his pool up with tab?  How long would that take, Jimmy?  Specify here.  Obviously, he doesn't have a lawn.  God almighty.  Yeah.  How about someone that hates water?  This guy takes a cake.  I love your new character.  What?  Jimmy comes up with the best characters.  Character?  All right, here we go.  It's just me.  Let's go to the...  Midge me. 
[01:10:00]  Chinese food worker caught doing this.  Some food for thought that may be a little hard to swallow.  Yeah.  Reports that a worker at a Rockland County restaurant prepared crushed garlic in a way that garlic  should never be crushed.  There is trouble afoot here at the Great China Buffet in Nanuet.  That's disgusting.  Where the garlic is not only saut√©ed in steam, but allegedly stomped.  He's actually doing this, and there's garlic pieces laying all around. 
[01:10:30]  John Stoughton is with the Rockland County Department of Health and says this is a picture of  a worker from the restaurant stomping on a huge bowl of garlic with his shoes on.  We don't really approve of somebody using their shoes to crush the food with.  That's strong language.  I don't really approve of that.  Don't approve.  You know how he got caught?  No.  A gentleman took a picture. 
[01:11:00]  You know what store was right next door, though?  The photography store?  A cell phone store.  Oh, okay.  Every phone has a freaking camera on it.  So a guy took a picture.  He was actually outside stomping this garlic with his...  Outside?  Yeah.  Dude.  You had to walk out the...  In a back alley of a Chinese restaurant.  You know how we were talking about how awful that street is outside this building?  Yeah.  It's the same type of situation.  So he walks out the back door in an alley.  He's walking...  They show what he walks in.  He's got this giant, you know, stainless steel wok-looking thing. 
[01:11:30]  It's full of garlic.  And he's crushing them with his shoe, his boot, that he's been walking around in this  disgusting back alley in.  And crushing the garlic to bring inside and then using the food.  Isn't that fantastic?  It was a Chinese food buffet?  Yeah.  And then they confront the owner and, of course, he's, you know, yelling.  I wish I could imitate the guy yelling.  At the news reporter. 
[01:12:00]  But they dumped me doing that.  Although he didn't sound like, please get away from me with that camera.  Please, please.  Do we have audio of the guy yelling?  I don't know.  We'll see here.  He was jumping up and down over here.  The photo was taken by Dan Barreto, who works at the AT&T store right next to the restaurant,  and says he witnessed it in the back alley.  He was just jumping up and down on it at first.  And then when I grabbed my camera, he was just doing one foot in.  Just stepping, mashing it up.  The garlic.  Yeah, the garlic.  At the restaurant today, an employee told us the man in the picture has been fired. 
[01:12:30]  The guy is not walking here.  The restaurant has been cited with two violations and a warning for a first offense.  But if it happens again, the health department could really put its foot down.  Imposing $1,000 fines per violation.  Scott Rappaport, CBS 2 News.  The restaurant has reportedly said that crushed garlic in question was thrown away and was not served to customers.  The health department says the restaurant was fined back in 2001 for unsanitary conditions.  Yeah, because I'm sure this was the first time he did that.  Yeah, they threw it away. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Stop.  Yeah, I like when the guy was getting mad at the reporter, though.  I started yelling at him to get away.  Why can't you just put the garlic on a thing and put like a cloth over it and hammer it?  A garlic press.  Yeah.  Because it was a whole big thing.  It's too much to press, so you've got to stomp it with your nasty boot that's been walking around in street sludge.  That's terrible.  It's disgusting.  It's official.  Oh, it is?  What is?  We got a promo or a sweeper or whatever.  Oh, yeah?  From Tim.  It's official. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, no.  It's ONA's Wednesday Morning Zoo Bits of the Day.  Oh, thank God.  Some comic relief.  H2O.  Jesus.  Hell no to H2O.  What was that?  I don't know.  Worse than cocaine.  Hell no to H2O.  Yeah, of course it is.  We all know it's worse than cocaine at this point. 
[01:14:00]  I don't know what the promo was.  It's all just a bunch of noises.  Yeah.  That's what morning zoos do.  I actually like it.  They just do a bunch of noises?  They just confuse you with a lot of sounds.  Ah, to try to throw you off.  To make you think that you're actually listening to something.  Listening to something of substance.  I have to disagree with you on that one.  That's what they do exactly.  All right.  Hey, you guys hear this Britney Spears YouTube video?  I'm saying it here because we're on the radio. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, have you seen the YouTube video?  I haven't.  I've heard it.  A lot of people are playing it as the real thing, and you're saying it's fake, right,  Jimmy?  Sounds fake.  It was a guy who looks like the guy who hung out with Brain in Escape from New York, who  brought the president's finger.  That's what he looks like.  Picture that guy, if he was a little gayer looking, and crying.  You can see the guy's holding a camera above his head, and he's filming himself, slash herself,  talking about Britney and being upset.  About Britney being her comeback there on MTV and looking like crap and lip syncing and 
[01:15:00]  just making a joke of herself.  And this guy, slash girl, starts crying and saying that people should be nicer to Britney  and yelling.  But it's so fake.  Yeah, it is.  Does Steve think it's fake or real?  Because whatever he says, it's the opposite.  He actually thinks the guy is fake.  He thinks it's a robot.  They played it on TMZ last night on TV there as a real video. 
[01:15:30]  And here's the problem.  We all love those video sites, but there's a lot of fake crap out there.  Yeah.  Someone's got to call the people out on these fake videos.  Fake.  Like the explosive diarrhea and the jacuzzi.  That's one of the hottest videos ever on break.com.  That's still undetermined.  It's not undetermined.  Undetermined.  We went frame by frame with that video.  It's so obvious that's fake.  But.  By the reaction.  No definitive proof.  All right, well.  Look at this thing.  All right, well, here's the audio.  What is it? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, it's a comedian?  Chris Crocker.  What?  Who claims he isn't acting.  And how dare anyone out there make fun of Britney after all she's been through?  She loves her aunt.  She went through a divorce.  She had two f***ing aunts.  Her husband turned out to be a user, a cheater.  And now she's going through a custody battle.  All you people care about is readers and making money off of her. 
[01:16:30]  She's a human.  That's so fake.  Why would you play this as real?  That's so fake.  Is there more of this?  Do you want to hear more?  I do.  What you don't realize is that Britney's making you all this money and all you do is write  a bunch of crap about her.  She hasn't performed on stage in years.  Her song is called Give Me More for a reason because all you people want is more, more, 
[01:17:00]  more, more, more.  Leave her alone.  You're lucky she even performed for you bastards.  Leave Britney alone.  It is funny, though, that all.  Please.  I got a joke.  Someone needs decaf.  He's a little, oh, Jimmy.  Whoa.  Crazy. 
[01:17:30]  A little biased.  I mean, hey, not to knock Britney, you know.  Maybe another person has said no to H2O, you know, a little too much caffeine.  Yeah, no to other things, too.  Hell no to things shaped like tacos.  Yeah.  Steve, real or fake?  Real or fake?  Well, knowing the right answer, the real answer. 
[01:18:00]  Wait, you really think this is real?  No.  No, I was the one who showed him the MySpace page.  I reached out to this kid a couple days ago.  Oh, you reached out.  Hi, my name is Steve.  You might have something in common.  You reached around.  Right, I'm sorry.  No, no response.  I wanted to see if we could get him on the show.  But no, he says he's a comedian, but he's got like nine of these videos online.  He is a comedian.  His name is Fez.  That's not Fezzy.  Yeah, it is Fez.  You can tell.  He mentioned it was Perez Hilton. 
[01:18:30]  Who, who, Perez Hilton had a show.  Do we know anything about it?  Was it good or awful?  Perez Hilton's on VH1.  I took a peek last night.  I am.  There's just so much gay stuff involved with the show.  We get it.  You're gay and you're comfortable with it.  All right, fine.  What else do you got for me?  Right.  There was nothing.  It was just over and over.  Gay this, gay that, blah, blah, blah.  Steve, did you even mention the show or that this was for radio when you reached out?  Or were you just reaching out for like maybe a few drinks? 
[01:19:00]  Maybe that's what I should have done.  Steve didn't call me again.  I feel the same way.  They're persecuting her.  Yes.  Leave me alone.  Steve, you're calling.  Steve, you're being there.  Stop calling me.  Right.  Personal agenda got in the way.  Oh, and I check out the video.  Internet people on YouTube.  It's a response to all those famous Internet videos. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  And Kid Chris had this guy on yesterday.  So Kid Chris is doing a better job than you.  We got the guy on.  Yeah.  Everyone was talking about this guy yesterday.  Chris Crocker.  Crocker.  Perez Hilton talked about professionalism and said if Brittany was a professional, she  would have pulled it off no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who's going through a  hard time?  Leave Brittany alone. 
[01:20:00]  Please.  I can't give this person credit because he didn't leave his name, but hell no to AZT.  Leave from Philly.  Morning Zoo Jimmy.  Roll.  Morning Zoo Jimmy.  And then he finishes up here.  Leave Brittany Spurs alone right.  Now.  I mean it.  Anyone who has a problem with her, you deal with me because she's not well right now. 
[01:20:30]  Leave real love.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I've made an ass of myself.  Damn, you've just been pwned.  Oos.  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[01:21:00]  Can I tell you that oos?  Oos.  I can listen to four hours of that.  I just love it.  Oos.  Oos.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  Oos.  What's mean?  I don't know.  It has some meaning.  I don't know.  It has some meaning.  I don't know what it is, but.  Uh.  Yeah.  Hmm. 
[01:21:30]  Uh.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, this guy says just like Grizzly Man.  Oh, remember Grizzly Man?  You remember that guy who hung out with the bears?  He let the bears kill him?  Yeah, of course.  And it was on tape, but they destroyed the tape or something.  Which made that documentary suck.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  No payoff.  It's the money shot.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  You're right, though.  Good observation.  All right, here's a quickie before break.  Before we get Stephen Lynch in here.  Ten-year-old Asheray Washington loves football. 
[01:22:00]  But after Friday, it could be a while before Asheray puts on a uniform again.  Because we was going to climb up that hill right there.  And then once you reach that fence, get back up and sprint back down.  Asheray says players were running into each other on the run down, so.  So I chose to walk down the hill.  But Asheray says that didn't sit well with head coach of the Midwest Marauders, Kurt McKinney.  He was like, you're too slow and you're no good for the team, so give me back my equipment. 
[01:22:30]  And matter of fact, take off my pants while you're at it.  So that's just what Asheray says he did.  Asheray says he sat in his boxers on these bleachers, then went to a neighbor's house.  I said he was wrong.  And he said the coach had made him take his pants off.  The vice president of the league says the coach denies doing anything wrong.  Why are we doing international news?  This cannot possibly be the United States of America. 
[01:23:00]  That's the United States of America.  Did I hear, I chose this to walk down?  Did I hear that?  Where was that, late?  I chose this?  I chose this.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Gotta give him UPS.  Oh, of course.  If you think someone's dead, you gotta start with that UPS right away.  Give him some UPS. 
[01:23:30]  I think we're focusing on the wrong part of the story.  Why?  Which is that the young man was forced to remove his trousers.  Oh, is that what the story was about?  Yes.  Down to his underpants.  I swear it was very hard for me to understand what was going on.  That must have been the South, right?  Was that down South?  I don't know.  He was a bad boy and a coach told him.  All right.  Gotta straighten you right out.  Sitting in your little boxes.  Yeah, you gotta sit over there in your little underpants and go line a lesson over there 
[01:24:00]  in the bleachers.  Come over and teach you.  Oh, that is the creepiest voice ever.  I think it was.  I got...  What did he say?  Oh, where is it?  Was it in the beginning of the clip?  It was when he talked about...  Yeah, it was in the beginning.  I don't want to play the whole thing again.  Let me hear him a little bit.  You gotta save time for...  Hell no to H2O.  Well.  Ten-year-old Osheray Washington loves football.  But after Friday, it could be a while before Osheray puts on a uniform again. 
[01:24:30]  Because we was going to climb up that hill right there.  And then once you reach that fence, get back up and sprint back down.  Osheray says players were running into each other on the run down, so...  So I chose to walk down the hill.  I chose to walk down the hill.  What's wrong with choses to...  I chose to walk down the hill.  What's wrong with that?  Wait, he might be saying, I chose just to walk down the hill.  He might have been saying, look, because Southerners...  Yeah.  I gotta say...  I chose just to walk down the hill. 
[01:25:00]  No, no.  I chose just to...  I chose just...  I could be.  I just...  I swear that was I chose to walk down the hill.  What's wrong with choses?  Choses?  Nothing.  I like to chose this from time to time.  I understood what he meant by it.  Perhaps you should chose this English instead of football.  That's what I would have chosen as far as schooling goes.  There's your line.  There it is.  Well, what are you gonna do? 
[01:25:30]  Well, we're gonna take a break.  Oh.  Oh.  You meant just...  Did you mean literally?  Yeah, literally.  What is the Dudleyan...  You can't tease me like that, E-Rock.  What do you got?  Go back to that screen.  E-Rock.  E to the rock?  E-Rock's a tease.  Oh, now he's panicking.  Oh, he's panicking.  It's tease rock.  I know, but I'm gonna...  I need a little radio tease here.  Looks like you might have something.  Oh, E-Rock.  What is that?  The long page, Eric.  How many windows did you need to...  Just open it all. 
[01:26:00]  Dudley and Bob in the morning?  What is this gonna be?  What are you working on over there?  It's a morning show out of Austin, Texas  that allows you to pay to be on their show.  How much?  Whoa.  I'll double check, but I think it's like $700, $800.  And then you pay and you're able to go on their show  and do what?  And they teach you how to be a professional radio broadcaster.  Oh.  Whoa.  We do that.  Really?  Yeah.  And we got some examples?  Yeah.  Hey, that could be fun. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Nice.  It is a slow news day.  All right.  Stephen Lynch joins the program next.  Louis C.K. in a little bit.  Philly, keep listening to WISP for all the info.  We're gonna be down there tomorrow and Friday  broadcasting live with lots and lots of things  for you to participate in.  Right?  Right.  All right.  O.P.  Anthony.  You listening.  Doing something interactive.  Whether it's on Pal Talk Show and your boobies 
[01:27:00]  because it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Ooh.  Or using that old instant feedback  that you can find on our website.  Old indeed.  Or maybe going old school and just giving us a phone call.  Very interactive show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got Stephen Lynch in studio.  But first, Jimmy was talking about  what he's digging lately in music.  Right?  Well, yeah.  It's like a song.  Oh, boy.  You got the strangest music taste.  The strangest.  You're absolutely right.  He'll be in a van driving to a hotel 
[01:27:30]  or a gig or something  and he'll have his iPod on  and he'll just be tapping  to some god-awful song.  And meanwhile, he digs Ozzy and Sabbath  and stuff,  but then he'll just listen to this  crap Betty Davis eyes or something.  He doesn't like that, though.  No, I don't mind retro stuff  because it's kind of funny.  Yeah.  And you almost remember  what you were doing at a certain time  when you hear the song  and it's part of your youth or something.  But you like some real crap new stuff. 
[01:28:00]  Awesome.  I like it.  I've been listening to that 20 on 20 station.  I like a lot of the popular music.  Popular music, Naughton.  I happen to like Beautiful Girls.  I went to iTunes.  And God, that's a good song.  Sean Kingston.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I got that from this show.  It's catchy.  It's catchy.  Umbrella.  I get three different versions of Umbrella.  See, Umbrella.  Now you're silly.  Now you're being silly.  Do you sing the Ella part?  No, I don't.  I always turn that down  because my girlfriend likes that part.  It really annoys me.  Oh, really?  So you turn it down. 
[01:28:30]  That's the main hook of the song, isn't it?  Yes.  Yeah.  And he turns that down.  That's why he's so weird.  That's like turning her to heaven  in Stairway to Heaven.  Right, right, right, right.  And she's bi-clicking.  I hate that part.  Don't like it.  No, I like the video.  Come on, give us one Ella.  Ella, Ella, A, A.  See, he's heard a few times.  That's the Akon's new song I like a lot.  Put the Blame on Me.  I just like that.  I normally wouldn't go for that.  I don't know if I know that song. 
[01:29:00]  I like old school rap.  I don't really like new stuff,  but I like that.  I'll be the reason for your pain  And you can put the blame on me  You can put the blame on me  You can put the blame on me  You can put the blame on me  Ella, Ella, Ella  You can put the blame on me  I've never heard of this song before.  It's a very popular song.  And I know some of the pop music.  I don't know this one.  I really don't.  What I liked about this one  was that in it, 
[01:29:30]  he's talking about Verizon  pulling out of some sponsorship  because he had something  with an underage girl.  I think he just danced with her  inappropriately,  but it was in a club  where it was 21 and over.  In a club?  Yeah, in a club.  21 or older.  Was he having sex?  No, but he was on tour  with Gwen Stefani  and he got in some kind of trouble  for something  that she was supposed to be 21  to be in the club  and he just addressed all of it  in the song.  I liked it.  It's a good song.  All right.  I think you'd like it  if you heard it.  And I think that you'd find 
[01:30:00]  your little leg tapping.  Probably not.  You can put the blame on me.  It's lovely.  Probably not.  Here's like,  this I don't mind.  This I can't get laughed at for.  You know?  What is it?  Song Garden?  That's good.  Wolf Mother.  Yeah, Wolf Mother.  Yeah, it's fine.  Like, that's good.  Wolf Mother rules.  But I could get laughed at  from many other songs  on my iPod.  Remember when they said  they were going to be  on our show?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Another.  Remember?  My roommate in college  had owned two CDs.  Meatloaf, Bad Outta Hell  and the soundtrack  to The Sound of Music.  Oh, wow.  And he was a big football player  and I just,  it was genius  because I couldn't peg him  for the whole year.  What the hell?  Who are you?  Yes, I guess  whatever you're listening to  at the moment  depends on what you have  in your mouth.  Wow, that's two terrific CDs  right there.  What can you say about that?  It was 1989.  There weren't a lot of CDs.  Lynch, you playing the Philly show? 
[01:31:00]  We don't know.  You are.  Yeah.  Okay, well, you know,  you're here to promote  the big show.  You're such a big star.  You come and go.  I don't know.  Most of the guys  that have done every date,  you do like,  you did like three, four.  I like to take the summer off.  Very cool.  No, you'll be at Camden Saturday,  the ONH Travel and Virus Comedy Show,  the last one for a while.  And that's why we're going to Philly  tomorrow and Friday  to pump up the show.  Yeah.  So.  Pump it up in Philly.  Huh?  I like Philly.  I just don't like the idea 
[01:31:30]  that they have us doing something  24 hours straight.  Well, they're affected itself.  You can put the blame on you.  Oh.  They get excited  when we go to Philly.  I know.  Take advantage of the time  we have down there.  Of exhausting us.  We have to meet clients.  We have to go to the Philly's game.  Philly's playing very well.  Then we do our,  a couple live shows  and the comedy show  broadcast before the comedy show  with Kid Chris backstage.  Wow.  Yeah, it's just the.  I find Philly shows  just to be exhausting. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  The shows themselves  because they're such animals.  They're just a great audience.  I know, yeah.  It's like a constant fight.  It's a great audience.  Kanye West flipping out backstage  at the VMAs.  What do we know about this?  Apparently he was mad  he didn't win.  You can't get mad  if you don't win.  You're not supposed to show it.  Right.  You're supposed to go,  oh, all right.  I guess it wasn't good enough.  But he, you know,  I understand he says something  about how black people  can't get a chance  and he's right  because black people 
[01:32:30]  are never culturally featured  on MTV.  What?  Really?  I mean, there's no...  Who the, what the?  They've taken over MTV.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to hear  white boy music anymore.  Of course not.  So what is he talking about?  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know.  That's the beauty of it.  How do you not love him?  Right.  Sometimes you just  got to blame Whitey.  It's just the way it is.  Can I say one thing  about the black blame white people?  I do understand that thinking  because I had a thing  where a snotty black employee  recently,  it probably had nothing 
[01:33:00]  to do with me being white.  He's just a bad employee.  But I'm like,  he doesn't like me  because I'm white.  It's amazing how  immediately...  Oh, really?  You just instantly do that?  So if I was black,  I'd probably be saying  that all the time too.  You said that in your head?  It's amazing.  Something else would have  been said in my head.  But no, he wasn't.  He was just being  like a typical dumb employee  who just didn't want to help.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  That was...  Did I think we...  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, but we're okay  because you can't say  that Wednesday.  Right.  So we get a pass on Wednesdays.  He wasn't being awful. 
[01:33:30]  He was doing...  He was technically  doing his job.  He was just annoying me.  But I went right  to the racial thing.  Like, he doesn't like me  because I'm white.  And I'm like,  if I was black,  I'd probably say that  all the time.  Yeah.  So I definitely get it  because I'm white  and I very rarely  have racial problems.  And yet that's still  the first thing I thought.  Well, here's...  Race.  Race.  Here's Kanye West  just losing his mind,  which is pretty good.  Sam, stay close.  Black man in chairs, man.  F*** MTV.  Tell him what the f*** I said.  Y'all have these f***ing lights, man.  Five nominations. 
[01:34:00]  F*** lost to Black Eyed Peas  last year, man.  I'm never coming to MTV.  I guess that is  kind of embarrassing  to lose to the Black Eyed Peas.  He's got a point.  He's got a point.  He does.  At least he loses gracefully.  What a baby.  What a baby.  Shut your face.  I blame the whites  for me not winning  the Tony last year.  Yeah, see?  See?  But you're not yelling  and screaming backstage.  And by whites,  I mean gays.  Of course.  We know exactly.  I know who votes. 
[01:34:30]  I'm never coming to MTV.  Y'all find Britney.  Get Britney.  Get a real f***, y'all.  Get Britney f***ing Spears.  I ain't f***ing with this  pop s***, man.  What is he saying in there, Sam?  Well, he's pretty pissed off  that Britney Spears  opened the VMAs.  He said he wanted to  open the VMAs  with his song Stronger.  And he was pissed off  because he had to perform it  in a suite.  Like at the VMAs,  they had a bunch of the artists  performing in suites 
[01:35:00]  at the Palms.  Yeah.  And only a few people  actually on the main stage.  And so he said that  he wanted to perform  on the main stage  and he wanted to open.  So he was saying that  Britney Spears  is not a real artist  and she got to open it  because of the...  He's delusional.  Everyone wanted to see  Britney Spears open the VMAs.  There wasn't a buzz  about Kanye West  might open up the VMAs,  but even I took a peek  because I'm like,  Britney Spears is going to be on  trying to perform?  I got to watch this.  He's right,  but it was the right move  for them to make  was having her.  He's a better artist than she is.  Oh, absolutely.  She was... 
[01:35:30]  Pat Strong is an idiot.  What?  Huh?  Listen to that tirade.  He's just an idiot.  You don't like Stronger?  That's a good song.  No!  I got to be honest.  I've heard it.  I don't want to like it,  but I liked it.  Not this.  Hey.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  It's skipping.  Can you fix that?  I need you to...  I can't wait much longer.  I know I got to be right...  You like this?  Well, yeah.  Sometimes the opening 
[01:36:00]  for rap songs  is a bit questionable  until they get into it.  Like...  Oh, there it is.  It's like a Justin Timberlake opening,  but the song itself,  he is good.  You can't...  Kanye West is...  I need you right now.  Let's get lost tonight.  You could...  This sucks.  It does suck.  Oh, does it suck?  Oh, it's got a nice little tempo.  No, it doesn't.  From the Kristen and Kristen New York,  damn, they don't make them like this anymore.  Bussy, bussy, bop.  Bussy, bop.  Yuck. 
[01:36:30]  But I kind of...  The opening of rap songs  are getting questionable.  Akon's opening.  Even the song I love,  he's talking.  Yo, I'm just...  You know, it's like...  Stop.  Just get into the same part.  Here's more Kanye West  flipping out backstage  at the VMAs.  Oh, good.  Last two years in the road, man.  Get all this...  Man.  I love this...  Man.  God damn, man.  Give me a...  A chance, man.  Give a black man a chance.  I'm trying hard, man.  I got the...  Number one record, man.  I'm trying, man.  I'll give a...  A chance, man.  Now they work it up.  Y'all wanna... 
[01:37:00]  They don't wanna...  Look at that position, man.  They don't want it, man.  Get in here.  I'm not gonna get in here.  He's a bit of...  Is he using...  Because two years in a row?  Yeah.  What about poor, like,  Tony Basil?  How many years since Mickey?  She's still sitting there  going, damn.  She's still waiting  for the follow-up.  I did Mickey.  It was huge.  What about someone else, Kanye?  Yeah.  Wow, he's kind of  a sore loser, huh?  Was he saying  give an N-word a chance?  Was that the N-word?  I mean,  Rihanna Umbrella 
[01:37:30]  won for Video of the Year  and he thought  Stronger should've been  Video of the Year.  Umbrella's a great video!  Are you kidding me?  How sexy...  She's dancing with an umbrella!  That's a great video!  There you go, right there.  It is a great video, though.  Is this?  Yeah, there's like water...  It's...  I know I'm not doing it justice.  All I said was  Umbrella and water  and I'm like,  uh-huh, get it?  Where do you see videos  these days?  I don't remember.  I went to YouTube.  I went to YouTube  because I wanted to see  the video  and the video sold me  on the song,  It's a chick smoking hot  with an umbrella.  It's not just a chick.  It's a guy at first  and there's some kind 
[01:38:00]  of rainy stuff around him  for the whole beginning  of the goddamn song.  I'm sitting there going,  where's the broad  in the umbrella?  I don't like the rap  in a lot of the good songs either.  They do that.  I don't need it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't need it.  Yeah, for a chick  to be like legit,  if I may use the vernacular,  legit.  Nice.  You gotta have  a black rapper guy  in there too.  Well, I'm sure  it helps sell records too.  Does it?  Sure.  Will it?  Yeah.  Can it?  It is.  If I'm answering  everyone in the gym,  yes.  No?  Sure. 
[01:38:30]  Let's go to Brandon  and St. Pete.  What's up, Brandon?  St. Pete.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey, man.  Jimmy, dude,  I'm just like you  where I like the metal stuff  like Pantera  is my favorite band.  I can't get that  umbrella song stuck,  you know,  out of my head.  It's stuck there.  Yeah, dude,  I got a weird taste.  Of course,  I live for that metal.  It's just my favorite.  But I like a little bit  of the pop too  and I got a weird reggae.  Hey, who's better  than Bob Marley?  You can't not like  Bob Marley.  There's something wrong  with you if you don't  like Bob Marley.  Give me the top songs 
[01:39:00]  in America right now.  I'll tell you what I like.  No, come on.  Go you.  You don't like Bob Marley?  Who doesn't like Bob Marley?  400 years?  Peter Tosh  before he's stuck  one in the head?  It's just...  What's wrong with Bob Marley?  I'm not a big,  like,  I'm not a huge reggae fan.  I like hearing it  when I'm on vacation  in the Bahamas  drinking a drink.  The steel drum?  Yeah,  but I won't sit down  and listen to it  like casually.  How about a little...  If I'm on a beach  somewhere in the Caribbean  drinking a little banana,  dirty banana  with the rum in there, 
[01:39:30]  ooh,  nice Cuban cigar,  then if it's in the background,  it's fine.  I'm not going to seek it out  and put it on my iPod.  That's reserved for ABBA.  If you're on a boat  with Michael Madsen...  Be careful  as far as those  dirty bananas go, though.  Why?  What's the problem?  I might catch something.  No, I mean,  it's a drink, Opie.  It's not a nightly  indulgence.  All right,  I'll tell you what I like  on the top songs in America.  I like that dumb rock star song 
[01:40:00]  by Nickelback.  Nickelback going country.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Cigars and Scotch  says it right here.  Reggae sounds like  one long bad song.  No, he's wrong.  No, he's pretty much right.  Some reggae I don't like,  but Bob War by Bob Marley  is one of the best songs.  Tink, tink, tink.  Oh, enough.  I hate the  Hey There Delilah song  that's being played  on every radio station  in America  by the, what,  Plain White Tees?  Yeah.  Give me a little  of that Plain White Tees.  Hey There Delilah.  You know this song.  I hate this song. 
[01:40:30]  Never heard it.  No, never heard it.  You've heard it.  You've heard it.  It's everywhere.  It's a little sappy.  I think we played  here in New York too.  Hey There Delilah,  what's it like  in New York City?  Yeah, I know this song.  But girl, tonight  you look so pretty.  It's alright.  When does it really kick in? 
[01:41:00]  Hey There Delilah,  don't you worry  about the distance.  Oh, I know about that.  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But that's not kicking in.  Can you say Simon and Garfunkel?  Yeah, a little bit, right?  Without the Garfunkel?  Without the Garfunkel part to wreck it?  Oh!  Alright.  I like this.  It's not great,  but it's listable.  I get it.  It'll be on your iPod tomorrow.  It won't be, Delilah.  It certainly will be. 
[01:41:30]  iTunes, how do you know?  I'll help you out.  It's the plain white tease, okay?  When he wrote the line  about New York City,  what I want to know  is how he came up  with the next line  about pretty.  It's Dylan-esque.  It certainly is.  Yeah.  It's genius.  I'll agree.  That's pretty awful.  It's a huge song, though.  What else do you like  on the, um,  or don't like?  I like Beautiful Girls.  I like Stronger.  Big Girls Don't Cry  by Fergie.  I don't know that one.  I don't know that one.  Beautiful Girls, I know.  Well, Eric,  could you just pull up  that you have  all these pictures 
[01:42:00]  because you want  to play pieces?  How about, uh...  Ah, forget it.  This isn't going anywhere.  All right.  Most of these,  we don't really know.  Exactly.  There's a reason.  Let's say hi to  Charlie in Brooklyn.  Charlie!  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, Opie,  you know you're a redneck  when you don't like Bob Marley.  What's wrong with Marley, man?  Yeah, what's wrong with Marley?  I just don't...  I'm not a big fan of reggae.  I tolerate it  when I'm on vacation,  but I won't seek it out  to listen to it 
[01:42:30]  any other time.  I'd say he has probably  the most varied audience  of any artist I've ever heard.  As far as across the board,  old young...  There's really no situation  that you can't play in it.  I think most people like reggae.  They say they like it  just so they can kind of be cool.  No, maybe.  Yeah.  I mean, I like business.  Yeah.  All right, Charlie, I'm with you.  I like a little reggae.  Hey, Brian from Florida.  Rawga.  This douchey song...  Barbershop Rawga.  That's what I like.  Barbershop Rawga. 
[01:43:00]  Too much perspective.  Too much effing perspective.  Brian writes,  this douchey song  reminds me of the Boxer  from Simon and Garfunkel.  That's the song.  Yeah, without the greatest part  about Simon and Garfunkel,  which are the beautiful harmonies.  The harmonies.  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony Nakumia from Jersey.  Opie, you can't go wrong  with Muse.  You like the Muse there?  I like the Muse.  It's sort of a Radiohead ripoff,  but I like it.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  All right, what are we going  to do here?  Stephen Lynch is going  to play a song for us  maybe after the break?  Oh, I feel it. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, if I can figure out  what to play.  Okay, well, you've got  a few minutes.  It's also...  Regular radio.  It's impossible.  Could you do any more?  We also have  Morning Zoo Bits  we're playing today.  Right.  Bitses?  Yeah, well...  Tim didn't put that part  in the promo.  Oh.  In the sweeper, unfortunately.  It's O&A's  Wednesday Morning Zoo  Bits of the Day.  Bits of the Day.  Open and opening.  Morning Zoo Audio File.  Bits of the Day.  Wednesday Morning Zoo  is Bits of the Day.  Bits of the Day.  Bits of the Day. 
[01:44:00]  It's nice to get  Vos to introduce it.  And so far we gave  the people...  We forgot the first one.  What was it?  Oh, the Kid Rock'em Sock'em.  Kid Rock'em Sock'em.  And then, of course,  this fave.  Hell no to H2O.  Hell no to H2O.  Why did they come up  with a song  about not liking water?  What does it mean?  Yeah.  Kimmy will explain  in a second.  He gets this stuff.  Hell no to H2O.  Man, it's got no taste.  Hell no to H2O. 
[01:44:30]  Gotta go when you serve  that H2O.  Is it a parody or something?  I don't know.  This guy's like water.  What's next, pal?  No more air?  That'll be the follow-up.  Yeah, hey.  Get out of here  with all that air.  This guy's gotta cut it out.  Well, we got one more  for today,  and then we'll rest  the Morning Zoo Bits  of the Day  for this fine Wednesday.  It's Rockstar.  Rockstar.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  A rap bit about drinking  Rockstar Energy drink  from the Dave and Jimmy show  on the cat  in Lexington, Kentucky.  Pull over, folks.  I asked whoever  got this, Sam,  is this a live read?  Is this a commercial?  Because it's for the  energy drink Rockstar,  and they're telling me no.  This is supposed to be  a funny bit for their show.  All right.  Rockstar, here you go,  from the Dave and Jimmy show  on 104.5 The Cat  in Lexington, Kentucky.  I was out the other day, 
[01:45:30]  with the girls,  and this guy's talking to me. 
[01:46:00]  He was kind of hot,  and he bought me this drink,  and I really didn't know  what it was.  So I tried it.  It looked like beer,  kind of smelled like beer,  but it wasn't really beer.  It was so good,  and then I wanted to dance,  and then I talked a lot,  and then we talked a lot,  and then we kind of pissed,  and then I danced some more,  and then we kissed,  and we talked,  and then my lips hurt,  and my jaw hurt,  and my hips hurt,  and I talked,  and I danced,  and I danced,  and I talked,  and we made out,  and then I touched wiener,  and I didn't know what to do,  and then I just felt like a rock star.  Ha ha.  Dump, dump, dump, dump.  This is awful. 
[01:46:30]  Oh my God.  I'm hooked.  I like it.  Yeah, it's going to be on my iPod.  Anyway, Jimmy gets it though.  Jimmy gets this bit.  You have to balance this out.  Hey, drink a little warm milk.  You know?  You got a ball.  You're not kidding, toots.  That's what 2007 needed.  Another Valley Girl song. 
[01:47:00]  Yeesh.  Someone is saying,  it's on YouTube,  that there's a parody to  Hey There Delilah,  called Hey There Vagina.  Wait a minute.  Didn't you do that,  like 20 years ago?  I think so.  Yeah.  That was Brother Joe  doing the,  Tom Jones version.  Yes.  Wow, yeah.  The one we used to get away with  whatever.  We used to be able to get away with that  on the radio.  Everything.  Now we got to make up  like stupid themes 
[01:47:30]  just to get through  a day of radio.  Wait, you can't say dry.  Nope.  You can talk about it,  you just can't describe it.  Right.  You can't describe anything about it.  Okay.  No, we're well informed here.  Can you say that I got one  a while ago  that I was hoping  a Chinese worker  would stomp garlic into?  Sure.  Yeah, this is coming in.  Rich from Manhattan.  Quick, turn off the bit.  Tom's going to ask for money 
[01:48:00]  for Plugin' Rockstar.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  You sure do know him well.  I think we're going to get a song  from Stephen Lynch next.  Maybe.  We'll figure out  what the hell to play.  What?  Yeah.  I don't know if I can play anything  on the regular radio anymore.  Why are you scared?  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  Are you scared?  I'm scared.  Worst case scenario,  it doesn't go through.  All right.  You're just all cut up  just the way you intended.  I don't, you know.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Vagina.  I'll rent it dry.  But you brought the guitar.  What are you going to do with it?  I did.  I brought it because I was,  you know,  you asked me to bring it.  So we'll see what I can do with it.  It's like when Otto comes  with the puppet.  But, you know,  he's got to bring it.  Yeah.  The puppet just stares  at the clock waiting for nine.  All right.  We'll figure it out next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Monster Rain from Rochester. 
[01:49:00]  Hell no to H2O.  H2O.  Wasn't that what the people  of New Orleans were saying?  Wow.  That song is stuck  in a lot of people's heads today.  Steven Lynch in studio.  He's playing the  ONA Travel and Virus Comedy Show  this Saturday  in Camden, New Jersey  across the river from Philly.  And of course,  Louis C.K.  will also be there  and he's in the studio  as well.  Hello, fella.  It's his birthday  and he walked in  just bitching and complaining.  I don't know.  You were supposed to be here  a while ago, I think.  I know.  What happened?  Bad morning. 
[01:49:30]  Well, I walked my daughter  to school with my wife  on the way here  and of course,  my daughter won't carry  her backpack.  She won't carry  her own backpack  because it's impossible.  It took forever  just to get her  to a corner  where I could get a cab here.  Yeah.  And she keeps crouching  her whole body  to the sidewalk  and just saying,  it's cold  and I can't carry this  and I want someone  to carry me.  She just won't  walk to school.  Right.  It's torture.  Isn't she 15? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  15 in kindergarten.  And so I'm like,  you got it.  This is it.  This is life.  You got to go to school.  Just go.  I didn't like it either.  Yeah.  And she makes me  carry her backpack  which I carry.  There's no point  to it being a backpack  because I carry it.  It might as well  be a grown up backpack.  A briefcase.  Yeah, exactly.  Instead of a pink.  A attach√© case.  Hello Kitty backpack.  Aw.  And so then  I get to finally 
[01:50:30]  a corner where  I'm soaked in sweat  and I get to a corner  and it's my birthday.  Nobody cares.  Happy birthday there.  Whatever.  Absolutely.  The whole  my birthday thing  stopped very early  in the morning.  Few gifts forget.  so then I get in a cab  and I get here  as soon as I get here  I realize I have  her backpack  of course.  Oh boy.  Now how is she  going to get  any kindergarten work  done without all  of the tools  that you need  to take with you  to kindergarten?  What is in there  that she needs?  There's a folder 
[01:51:00]  in which they put  notes for us.  That's all it is.  For you.  Her backpack  is a mail bag  for us.  Yes.  That's all it is.  And there's a water bottle  a little pink water bottle  which is there  because they don't  give them water  in the public school.  You've got to send  them with water  or else they die.  They just dehydrate.  Yeah.  So my wife  I called her  because I had my phone  off this morning  so I called her  to say I have her  she goes I know  you have her backpack  she's crying  come back and bring it  and I'm like  I'm at work right now  and she says  so come back here 
[01:51:30]  and bring her backpack  so?  Yeah.  That's not a thing  you can say so to?  So when somebody here  is being very nice  from your show  and going to bring it  down to the school  but I called her  to tell her that  and she's like  yeah fine  so it's not my birthday  anymore.  It's not being my birthday  I evaporated my entire  birthday goodwill  but your wife is now mad  because you're not  bringing the backpack  to your daughter  even though you're  making arrangements  to have it dropped off  even though I'm  making arrangements  to have it dropped off  and I'm here  doing what I do 
[01:52:00]  by the way  make sure we know  who's bringing it  because there are  a couple of people  on our staff  that aren't allowed  within a hundred yards  of a school  depending on  their criminal past  or what they're  carrying on them  who's bringing it?  Who?  Not Pat Duffy  he's the one  yeah  probably can't go  near a school  yeah the fella  who brushed his teeth  with dog poop  and got thrown up  in the face  yeah  you better actually  have a further education  already  wait  that idiot  you should just  stop in there  maybe learn something  happy birthday 
[01:52:30]  Lou  oh thanks fellas  hope you're dead  before the next one  hi  you and me  both my friend  that must have been  a nice birthday  for a couple of years  September 12th  yeah  oh yeah  hey happy birthday  hope did you  know the tragedy  September 10th  we had my birthday  party early  because I was  flying to LA  on the big one  yeah  and I flew  the night before  to LA  but we had a big  birthday party  for me in our  backyard  and my wife  got me a pi√±ata  which we  oh look at 
[01:53:00]  how traditional  the head of that  pi√±ata still hangs  in our backyard  really  it's just this  symbol of the last  normal moment  oh yeah  our lives  it's just this  withering  or you're just  a lazy Mexican  who doesn't clean  up his pi√±ata  his own yard  I bet you got  some this morning  though right  a little birthday  some what  some what  I don't know  how it is  on the old birthday  you're gonna need  to go beyond  innuendo  for me to understand  because I didn't  get nothing  on my birthday  no  I got a pen 
[01:53:30]  a nice pen  it was a nice pen  it's a cross pen  yeah  there are nicer pens  a cross  a pen on your  birthday is good  if it's sticking  out of a vagina  hey you can't  say that  but it's  so you can't  say that Wednesday  wait the pi√±ata  what was it  like Spongebob  no it was  what  it was a burro  you know  a burro  an authentic  Spanish pi√±ata  so we just make 
[01:54:00]  fun of your  whole tradition  when we  go ahead man  get the Spongebob  one for the  seven year old  Americanize  the pi√±ata  if Mexicans  grew up with  Spongebob  they would use  them  they don't  it's not like  burros have  some  no gritty  it's burro  it's burro  it's the burro  of Queens  we don't say burro  it's the burro  of Brooklyn  but burro  is probably  correct  burro  and what is that  a bull  no it's a  donkey  it's a jackass  it's an ass  it's a  jackass  you burro  it's an animal 
[01:54:30]  that's half  I don't know  half horse  half donkey  it's a burro  are they the ones  that are sterile  when they're born  yeah they can't  they can't reproduce  they can't reproduce  you can only  they're genetic dead end  you can only make one  by breeding like  it's a horse  and a donkey  it's a horse  and a donkey  it makes a burro  it's a horse  and a donkey  a burro  yeah  and then they can't  mate with each other  it's the only animal  that has that  it's a mutant  it's a mutant  yeah  wow  a horse and a donkey 
[01:55:00]  well you know  I'm sure one is very happy  and one is like  come on  alright just hurry up  yeah I don't know who  I don't know  I think it  well I guess  male horse  it has to be a male horse  why  there's no way  a female horse  is tolerating  some pesky donkey  on a ladder  what do you know  about female horses  in their  believe me  very realistic  yeah  he's just saying  yeah the height  thing would be a problem  yeah  that's what he's getting at  you think a donkey  isn't as apt  to be able to 
[01:55:30]  accept certain things  than perhaps  some videos  you've watched  it is  it is  a donkey  is able to  physically do that  but I'm saying  the height difference  makes it a problem  yeah like  the horse  has to be very patient  and allow the donkey  to put its stupid  hooves up  and hoist itself  and no horse  is wading through that  no horse  yeah because usually  horse sex  is a much more  beautiful act  yeah it really is  it's just this mess  I know  I don't want to  it looks like  it's not clumsy at all  no  it looks like a fireman 
[01:56:00]  like let go of the hose  yes  that's always what it looks like  it looks like a hose  somebody lost  a lost grip of  yeah quick  turn that off  it's going all over  can we get Pat Duffy  on the phone  I want to see how  the backpack thing's going  well he hasn't left yet  because I got my wife  oh here she is  I got hold on  a second  alright boy  shh shh  hey  oh jeez  go  bring it to Raquel  in the office  and she's going to  bring it to the classroom  okay so he brings it

[02:00:30]  get a diplomatic  solution  look he's wearing  it  he's wearing it  oh god  oh god  that's kind of  gross  it's been fouled  now  that's like a guy  wearing your  daughter's panties  oh yeah  he fouled it  let me see the  back of that  what is it  hello kitty  oh it is a  little hello kitty  one  it's adorable  to get it off  the pal talk  that's enough  exploitation by  the most disgusting  show on the face  of my beautiful  little daughter  I know  in her bad day  in her little 
[02:01:00]  hello kitty  backpack  can we go through  the backpack  see what's in there  no  I told you  what's in there  yeah  there's the water  bottle here  turn around  you see the  pink water  yeah  it's adorable  and it's all  sparkly  that's nice  it's got little  sparkles on it  I picked it out  with her  it's way too  big for her  is it  yeah it looks  pretty big  it was a real  father's job  of picking  something out  for his daughter  yeah  and my wife  was like  oh it's  awful big  and then the  teacher said  that's really 
[02:01:30]  big  oh you  you screwed up  yeah completely  what did you think  I mean look  it fits him  it fits Pat  he could actually  use that  it's unpractical  for him  if your daughter  starts selling  encyclopedias  she can carry  them all  she's two  encyclopedias  she's five  but anyway  alright  and if she takes  a time machine  back to the 50s  sells encyclopedias  that's actually  people still do that  door to door  do they  no  of course not  they don't  nobody does  alright Pat 
[02:02:00]  how far of a  don't tell exactly  where it is  or anything  like in a  you know  miles  by the time  you get there  school's gonna be  over  it's kindergarten  don't they go  for 45 minutes  it's still three  it's a whole day  wow  yeah it's a major  that's rough  totally  it's a massive  difference  that's more time  for you  I went for like  10 minutes  she's been home  every day  I mean  we went to  preschool  but it was like  you go  you drop her off  and then you  turn around  you go home  you take a dump  and go back  and go  that's all it was 
[02:02:30]  oh she just  started kindergarten  she started kindergarten  in his last Tuesday  had she do  first day  with it being so long  well the first day  was just till 11  and then the second day  was just 11  and then till 3.30  at 11 was she like  hey what's the deal  she was happy  she liked it  they did a few fun things  and then she grew up  all at once  in one phone call to me  because I called her  and said  how was your first long day  and she always just says  oh you know  fun  nothing  she says  I don't like lunch  and I don't like recess  wow 
[02:03:00]  and I go why  well at lunch  the teacher's not there  I'm just at a table  and which  imagine that  and then she goes  and at recess  all the kids I know  run away and play  and I don't know  where they go  and then I just walk around  and watch other kids play  and I don't  and then I get sad  that is the saddest  thing I've ever heard  in my life  oh my heart broken too  I wanted to kill myself  why  should have  she just  now she likes it  she had a few days  and she found  I said to her  go up to a kid 
[02:03:30]  I was having trouble  with it  punch him  because she's having  memories that I remember now  like up until now  when she was  you know  when they're three  you're like  so what  she won't remember this  you know  I'll punch her in the face  it doesn't matter  they're gonna wipe  the hard drive  in a minute  it doesn't matter  it starts recording  at five  yeah at five  you press record  you know  you make a really good point  I don't remember anything  before kindergarten  no  nothing  nothing mattered  but now  she's gonna have  real memories 
[02:04:00]  but so I said to her  try going up to one of the kids  before recess  because if recess is crazy  nobody's gonna listen to you  right  go up to a kid earlier in the day  and say  can you tell me  where you're gonna play later  so I can be there  and I realized  I'm doing  what my dad used to give me  way too grown up  this is like  office politics advice  I'm giving her  she's in kindergarten  she's gonna go  excuse me  Tiana  could you let me know  where you guys  are planning to play  so that I can  interface with you  because when I got 
[02:04:30]  I got beat up in school  and my dad told  made me memorize  a speech  that I was supposed to give  to the kids  that used to pick on me  wow  it was a whole thing  of you must respect me  as your equal  oh  I am not  that must have worked  really well  you know  I have a right  to my own integrity  as a person  and he made me memorize it  and say it back to him  a bunch of times  who's your father  the president  that's like a presidential thing  yeah  no  my dad's out of his mind  did it work at all 
[02:05:00]  I didn't do it  then it just became  I have to make my dad happy  that he  that I'm gonna say this  I thought perhaps  but I'll never say it  I am owed  my own space  my own dignity  just as you  oh  ow  oh  god stop  punch  ow  exactly  that's terrible  we gotta end this side  of the show  I wanted to get into that  a little more  that's horrible  well  you know for next time  aw  but she's making friends now 
[02:05:30]  like  she is  she's making friends  she found a friend  and they play some  hula hoop games  yeah  unfortunately today is  I think she's now  shunning other kids  oh really  yeah I think  as long as she does it  on her own accord  that's fine  yeah  but if she's looking  to play  and the kids  like  run away  and she's alone  somewhere  that is heartbreaking  that is really sad  for a 5 year old  oh  unfortunately for her  today is  show off your  backpack and water bottle  I think so  someone's like  Pat Dovey  someone's saying 
[02:06:00]  Pat Dovey  doesn't give an ass  he's probably getting  a hello kitty tattoo  as we speak  probably  right  plugs Lynch  you got anything  besides the big show  Saturday  MySpace  has all my tour dates  I'm leaving tomorrow  to start in Boston  and finish up this weekend  in Camden with you guys  and then I'm  hitting the road  Virginia and DC  and yeah  just go to MySpace  Stephen Lynch  Stephen Lynch on MySpace  Lou  I'm in Orlando  with the Hard Rock  this Friday  and my tour is all over  the country  on MySpace also  and both these guys  will be at our show  on Saturday  in Camden  I think it's still available 
[02:06:30]  Jimmy  I'm going to plug  SuperDeluxe.com  because me and Florentine  did those things on it  like newscasters  and you know  check it out  and I hope you like it  Alright  tomorrow we'll be live  from Philly  for everybody  in the Philly area  just keep listening  to YSP  for all the details  make it easy  for everybody  right  Right  Alright  if you're not  joining us  over at XM  have a great day  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Hi, the Opie and Anthony show is returning 
[02:07:00]  Hello  Sans Opie and Anthony  I'm Opie  No, I want to be Opie  Alright, you're Opie  Alright, you could be  You have red hair  You could be Opie  Yeah, I'm Opie  I blow it  I already said they're not here  Fuck  But none of our listeners know what sans means  No  Oh, Anthony's here  Good  I'm so happy  They're back  We were settling into Anthony's chair  And Anthony marched right back  Play at least one sound effect  I wish we had to host the show 
[02:07:30]  Damn  Hope's gone to the toilet to relax for a few minutes  And  Ah, we were doing a little production  Louie just straightened his back and got ready to enjoy that scene  I know  We already did the real show  This is the, uh, who gives us  Ah, this is the phone-it-in part  Everyone knows  This is the already-been-paid show  Yeah  I will say, I love, uh, Free FM  But I, uh, I always have more fun here  Because I don't want to say what I want to say  But take advantage, we don't have bosses for at least another  Yeah, no bosses or anything  This is where it would take a while for them to prove that this show sucks 
[02:08:00]  Yeah  Like, on real radio, it's the advertisers call the next five minutes and say, we didn't like that  Didn't like it, there's a problem, we get called in for a meeting or something like that  But then it'd have to be, like, three months later, Jesus, nobody's subscribing anymore  Yeah, what happened?  We noticed, like, six months ago, there might have been a problem  Everything's very retroactive on this side  I think for Louie's birthday, can we please get someone to suck his dick?  Wow  Please  Jimmy, if you're, uh, if you're up for it 
[02:08:30]  Suck his dick  He wouldn't, I'm not saying Louie would stray, he probably wouldn't  But it was just the idea that somebody would offer to suck it, it would make him happy  Ah  If there was somebody that would suck my dick, that would be a nice birthday present  Just the idea  It's just the conceptual birthday present  Not to get my dick sucked, but that there's somebody who would  Who honestly would  Yeah  Like a girl who would say, look, I'll suck it for you right now  And you'd go, like, I can't  I can't, but that was nice  And then you'd just go and scrap thinking of her offer  Exactly  Which is very nice  And then I'd get really weird in my head about it 
[02:09:00]  And then, uh, like, oh, I really want her to suck it, but I am married  And then, and then I'd follow her home and hit her in the head in an alley or something  You'd have to  Fuck her dead mouth  And that would be my only way of dealing with it  Kind of like fucking  Kind of like fucking  Like, uh, uh, what's his name, uh, Amon Gert  And his, uh, Jewish, uh, housegirl  Like, he liked her and he's walking around her  But he's getting angrier and angrier  Yeah  Because he likes her  And that's kind of what that is  That's what happens  When you try to remain honest  Or do something that's moral 
[02:09:30]  And it ends up in you killing somebody and fucking their dead mouth  Always  Always  I mean, that's been my experience  Even in business situations  Yes  Ask Oscar Schindler  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  He probably raped a lot of those Jewish girls  Don't you think?  Jesus  On, on this Rosh Hashanah  You're going to make jokes like that?  I'm not joking  I'm not joking  I'm completely serious  I'm pretty sure he did  I'm essential to the war effort 
[02:10:00]  One-armed guy shoveling snow  God, I love his soul  In that movie, there's a scene where he's, uh, he has to get a, pick a secretary  So he's got these girls all interviewing and they're all so cute  And it's a funny scene  Yeah  Of him going like, which girl will I pick and flirt with all the time?  Yeah, yeah  But there's this underlying joke of like, and the rest will die in a gas chamber  Like, tee-hee  Oh, if you have nice tits so that they won't be sewn to your sister's face and then you 
[02:10:30]  get burned  What movie was that?  Schindler's List  Oh, yeah  Schindler's List  Okay  He's picking a secretary  And then he wound up going with, uh, with, uh, what's that cunt face's name who blew us off?  Ben something?  Ben?  Kingsley  Oh, Ben Kingsley  Oh, Ben Kingsley  Wonderful actor, though  Fair is fair  Great, thanks  No  Thanks for nothing  As a person, he's a cunt face bag of shit, but as an actor, he is  Yeah, but every part he plays, it's just like, if Gandhi did this 
[02:11:00]  Yeah  Gandhi worked for Oscar Schindler  Or if Gandhi was a mobster from England  Gandhi's a businessman  It's like if Gandhi was an actor  Because he's more Gandhi than he is who he is, yeah  That's just, it's his persona now  Gandhi played chess  Yeah, exactly  Nice  Nice  I don't remember that one  That was a good one  Searching for Bobby Fischer  Why would I watch that?  It's a great movie  You play chess  I don't  Larry Fishburne, Joe Montagna  I don't care who's in it, it's a chess movie 
[02:11:30]  It's not  How exciting could that be?  It's very  No  Where Ben Kingsley's telling the kid to try to find a move on a chess board  Yeah  And then he, the kid can't find it, so he swipes away all the pieces  Wow  Alright, I might have to see that now  Now find it  Now see it  And that's how those guys see the chess board  Is able to see it then when no pieces were there  Yeah  Those guys  Isn't that exciting?  Gives a shit  But no  Yeah, and Larry Fishburne is the streetwise  Yeah, he's the one  You've got to come and get my king 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, trying to teach him like  Yeah  In street lingo  Yeah, right  What chess is like  Shut the fuck up  No  He's watching the thing  Oh, I hate that  Bring out the queen, kid  Bring out the king  Yo, man  I'm the king  This is my  This is my turf  You've got to come and get my king  Oh, wow  Shut up, it's chess  Listen  Those guys in Washington Square Park  Those homeless guys  A lot of them are playing for food and booze  They are like master level players  They're bums  Really?  Yeah  They're very good  Grandmasters, when they come to the city 
[02:12:30]  Will a lot of times go to the park  And play those guys  And play those guys  Because they're animals  Like you're playing two  And piss themselves  Well, they're very  They will shit their pants  That's the difference  They shit their pants  Bobby Fisher flew first class  Haven Juice  Flew first class  Yeah  And they shit their pants  If one of them is missing a pawn  They can just reach in  And pull a nugget of shit out of their underwear  And plop it down  They do that in Harvard Square, too  In Boston  Same thing  These guys look homeless  But they can kick your ass in the chest  A lot of them are drunks  And fucking  They play and they taunt you  Like they talk a lot of shit 
[02:13:00]  But you  Like you move a piece  There's chess smack that they're talking  Oh, boom, boom, boom  No, it turns into fights sometimes  Really?  Some guy gets up from the table  And starts yelling  Chess fight  Dude, they're geniuses  These guys are geniuses  They're just drunks  And they're crazy  But they're brilliant  I went to the chess shop  In the village once  No, you didn't  Chess shop?  Yeah, it's a place where  Like you have people from  Many times  Eastern Europe  Go and they play chess  And drink bad coffee  And suck each other's dicks  I used to go in there 
[02:13:30]  But they don't even play you  They could just see on my face  That I sucked  And they wouldn't  Really?  They wouldn't even acknowledge you  As a chess player?  They wouldn't  No, but then finally  What's the chess look  Where they know  How do they know  Just by the way  There's this wise and old  Bitter  They're really bitter  Negative people  Yeah  But this dude from Czechoslovakia  Agreed to play with me  Because he was bored  And we're playing a game  And we're playing speed chess  With a clock  So it's like move, slam  Move, slam  Move, slam  And we're going back and forth  And all of a sudden  He goes and then he doesn't  And I do make a move  And then he doesn't move  And he's taking a long time 
[02:14:00]  And I think I got  I did something  Wow, you're like  Damn  I was sitting there  It's taking a really long time  And I'm like  I got this dude stumped  He doesn't know what to do  And more and more time goes by  And then finally he goes  Move, it's your move  God damn it  And I just fucked up  It was my move  And I'm sitting there  Thinking that like  It's your move  God damn it  He hated me  And then I moved  And he finished me off  In three moves  You were probably flustered 
[02:14:30]  You thought you unlocked  The key to this whole formula  And you really stumped this guy  That could be the most exciting  Chess story I ever heard  And I'm being absolutely serious  Hey, why don't we take your chest  Like I was interested in that  We'll take your chest stories  Oh yeah  Chess story Wednesday  If you read about  Fischer Spassky in 1972  Because the Russians own chess  Owned it  World Championship  Fucking Bobby Fischer  How he fucking  I think forfeited the first game  And it was a championship match  Against the world champion  And that gave us Moscow 
[02:15:00]  And we were able to then  Own the Soviet Union  After that  Yeah, they owned  Oh, that's right  It didn't make a shit bit of difference  It wasn't important  During the Cold War  They own chess but they don't own  Blue jeans  I'd rather own the blue jeans  Was that the day before or after  We were going to the moon again?  I'm trying to remember  That was  When people were playing chess  Did we go to the moon  Before or just after that  For the third or fourth time?  The Russians are going to the moon, right? 
[02:15:30]  I heard  Yeah, a little behind  Yeah, they're going to give that a whirl  Good luck to you  That poor bastard  Just going to be this skeleton  Either sitting on the moon  Or orbiting around  A happy Russian cosmonaut  Just sitting there  A skeleton in a capsule  That was the great thing  If you ever really hear  About their space program  The difference  We got there  Because we were so determined  And united and stuff  They got there  Because they have no regard  For human life  Yeah  Just  It was like  Hundreds and hundreds  Of dudes died  Yeah 
[02:16:00]  And are still floating around  In capsules  Hell yeah  Really?  Yeah  And we had  Our space program  Was pretty much like  We're not putting a human being  On top of this  Fucking missile  This explosive  Yeah  It's just  It's not going to happen  Until we know  There's a good chance  That he's going to get into orbit  Oh, Russians  The Reds  Put a man in orbit first  Because they didn't give a shit  If Stanislav  Fucking burnt up  They had an explosion  In their space program  That fucking wiped out  So many people 
[02:16:30]  And the bunker system  That was supposed to protect them  They were wiped out  That's how big  This explosion was  They didn't give a shit  They have guys up there  Fitting around, Lou  Yeah, I want to get back  Into that  I'm kind of making that up  You know what it is though  Things are so classic  Their space program  Is so classified  They have had some  You know  Deaths in their  In their space program  A bunch  So have we  But I mean  I would not doubt  For a second  There isn't some  Fucking  Something that ends  With S-K-I  On the uniform 
[02:17:00]  Wrapped around a skeleton  Yeah, I'm sure there is  There's gotta be  Hands on the controls  Just zipping around  When one of our pilots  One of our astronauts  Die  They're heroes  And it's a whole  They stopped the space program  For a few years  Yeah, yeah, years  There's a whole  Funeral  Investigations  In Arlington Cemetery  One of their guys died  They just announced  On the  Comrade  Dostoski  Fell on a pillow  And he's fine  Yes  It was glorious  Return to mother  Of Russia  Where he has now 
[02:17:30]  Been given  A large piece of land  To work the farm  As his own  Meanwhile  He's fucking dead  They killed his family  So they don't spill the beans  And they turn  They turn to the next  Cosmotic and go  It's your turn  God damn it  It's your turn  Get in you  Faggot  What are you waiting for  Hey, we gotta go to  Drudge by the way  Speaking of Russia  I don't think they have  A government anymore  What happened  I think they dissolved  Their government overnight  Well the prime minister  Fucking  What's going on  Well the prime minister 
[02:18:00]  Resigned  And it's actually  Over a chest  There was  For a second  I looked at Jimmy's eyes  Like oh my god  If this is true  I am so fucked  The prime minister  Did resign  I don't know why  How about Putin  Putin  Putin  Putin dissolves  Russian government  Yeah no this is  Putin  It's not them  Having no government  It's him taking  He's taking over  Everything  You know something  Putin is going  Back to the Soviet Union  To the Soviet Union  He started  Getting the  He's got the bombers  Up again 
[02:18:30]  They got a new  Missile system  That he's developing  They got new nukes  He's got those  Those bomber planes  He's got the bombers  That are now being  Tailed by England's planes  And if they start  Cruising around Alaska again  We're gonna have to  Send other guys up again  We're gonna have to  Repoint  You know our missiles  Are pointed away from  I know  They're bringing back  Russia as we know it  I hope so  That's what he says  They look at this  Like we look at radio stations  Like they knew that  Free FM was a bad idea  And they're bringing back  To Rock  They're consolidating  They're going back to Rock  Is that what's going on? 
[02:19:00]  It's like radio stations  They decided  Ah that format sucked  Let's go back to what we know  We go back to Rock  Radio chick  Who is nobody cares  That's bullshit  No one wants to listen  To the talk radio  Nick DiPaolo good  You know  But they can't just  Build up  To kill him  Can only be one show  In charge  Welcome back  Soviet Union  Welcome back  Welcome back  The rest of the world  Has been a bunch of  Cocksuckers  Ever since they  Treated the United States 
[02:19:30]  Like shit  Yeah  Because we were the ones  That got rid of the other  Bad boy on the block  Now have fun  We need the Soviet Union  Right now  We absolutely do  Because they need to  Fight the Arabs for us  Yes  They're the ones  Who killed Hitler  We did not beat Hitler  Let me tell you something  The whole world  Couldn't beat Hitler  And Russia did it  Because  Same reason they won  The space program  Because they were willing  To walk  They lost way more dudes  Than anybody else  Just because they did that  Doesn't mean that  They're  You know  That they're all bad 
[02:20:00]  No  That's what I'm saying  Is that now  They're going to use  Their crazy  Life doesn't matter  Mentality  To kill the Muslims  While we sit back  And get the praise  I think we got to play  Poor guy was beaten anyway  Yeah  Just let him friggin  You know  Hang out in his bunker  I think we got to play  A stink fuck today  Put him on display  That's what they wanted to do  But Hitler said  No  I'm poisoning myself  And then burn me  I shan't be in some  Russian museum  That sucks  It would have been awesome  Oh  Imagine seeing the  Hitler stuffed Hitler  I saw

[02:26:30]  Yeah and ideology rhymes with the other thing  Biology  Was it biology  I like that song  I like that song  That's the same rhyme  That's off your iPod there Jimmy  Piece of shit song  Hello  Hello  What did he do  Putin dissolved a Russian's government  Yep  Good boy  The  He didn't want it  The solution is expected to result in a new prime minister  Who will be seen as Putin's choice to succeed him after he steps down  That's what folks do  It's like what Hitler did  It's the exact same thing  So he's like supposed to step down 
[02:27:00]  Or you know his term is up  Or whatever the hell it is  So instead of just letting this election process go  He dissolves the government and says  I'll put this guy in charge  He didn't want to deal with that  He didn't want to deal with that pesky election  Yeah  That dumb election stuff  This is what Hitler did  The way he took power is fascinating  Cause it was like a system just like ours  It was a parliamentary system  And he just used politics to get himself made pure  Like he used  He got enough guys in his party 
[02:27:30]  And they kept walking out on every vote  So that they had a non-functioning government  And they couldn't pass anything  Cause you needed a certain  You know it's like you need two thirds or something  So he just kept doing all these weird little games  And people had to do a little more and more  And he got more and more seats  Weird little games too  Amounted to a few brown shirts  Beating the shit out of everybody  That was voting against who he wanted  Yeah  That would be great if they still  Putin is the Sith Lord  Holy shit  Just found that out 
[02:28:00]  Oh also Russia tests super strength bomb  Is also on a drudge  Because  What can you call a super strength bomb?  I know  We have like  It's a big round black bomb  With a wick  Yeah  They're calling that  Cause it's the most powerful non-nuke bomb  This bomb will completely make your face all black  And your hair grow up  Your hair will go all funny  I would hide it in a box  With a ribbon and a bow on it  And then you open it up  Some will be put in cigars  Which will peel back like banana 
[02:28:30]  And your eyes will go googly  And your teeth will be all knocked out  We have to  We'll still work on it  Because all it takes is  A few shakes of head  And you're back to normal  The father of all bombs  Is what they're calling it  Well it can't be that if it's new  It'd have to be an old bomb  Russia has tested the world's most powerful vacuum bomb  Which unleashes a destructive shock wave  With the power of a nuclear blast  It's the father of all bombs  It's the latest in the new series of Russian weapons 
[02:29:00]  Yep  They got all new weapons now  Let's hope they use it  In the Middle East somewhere  How nice would that be  Although they're friends with Iran  They usually are  Well yeah  That's what they're waiting for  One of us to like  Decide Iran's doing too much  With their  With their nuclear program  Bomb them  And then  North Korea  Russia  And Iran  Yeah  It's like  You know  It's a nightmare  Nice axis of evil  It's a nightmare  Nice axis of evil  It's a good solid team  Yeah  Just put the shades down  And hope nothing happens

No  We just heard it through speaker  Yeah  But  Is there  Is there something?  When it goes off speaker  And I guess Steve Jobs is just so brilliant and so hip 
[03:10:00]  He forgot  That when you use a phone  You put it to your ear  And you hold the other end to your mouth  Yeah  You talk and listen  You have to be wearing a black mock turtle for it to work  Ah yes  And do the little zip  Everything opens  I really want to break it  I want to break it  Is the case covering up maybe a sensor or something?

[03:11:00]  There's no way I'll break it  No he can't  As much as I would love  The satisfaction of baseball batting it  Would be wonderful  But I just can't now  But I'm just going to go back to the horizon  Did you get your hundred dollars?  You robbed me for two years  You fucking robbed me for two years  Did you get your hundred dollar  I went  The New York store doesn't have it  When the guy was blowing me off  I was trying to buy a fucking six thousand dollars  With the computer equipment  The guy was kind of a cunt to me  Right  I  I  I  Oh fuck  Whatever man  I just fucking disgust it  I love

[03:12:30]  And they actually  It died yesterday  And still paying for insurance  I called up  And said  Look I want to replace it  And they said  Nope sorry  I can't replace your phone  So I basically told Verizon  To go fuck off  And bought the iPhone  No they don't care  The whole  You know  Go fuck yourself  Doesn't  No they don't care  Well I'm going to go  Take a baseball bat to it  And put it on YouTube  They don't feel  They don't have any nerve endings  In their phones  Well dude you're right  Verizon can be scumbags too  I'm certainly not saying  That they can't  Every phone company is shit 
[03:13:00]  My problem is just  This perception  And the way that  You're right  The black turtleneck  And the way they zip through  Everything with their fingers  And then for me  Not to be able to hear on it  And the speaker volume  Is atrocious  You know what the best thing is  We should just  Just pop up the video  From when they introduced it  Yeah  For Jimmy  And look at the picture  And now look at what I'm doing with it  Yeah  And the whole audience  Is just freaking out  So stupid  Dude  How about a phone call  The real problem with it  Is not

Well, Lauren, it's to you.  He's going to...  Lauren, you've got to get graphic. 
[03:27:30]  Graphic?  But I thought you can't get graphic on that.  All right.  No, don't worry about it.  She gave up.  I think I won her.  Don't worry about it.  Andre, you just sit down and shut up.  Yeah, we'll...  Let Lauren kick your ass a little bit.  All right.  Lauren, what are you going to do?  Reach in with two fingers and do something.  Wow.

[03:28:00]  Jesus.  You're going to lose.  How about we go with our...  Make them growl to see growl contest.  Growl to see growl.  Since the foo fighting didn't work out?  No, I thought you were telling me to feel it.  Ah!  Hold on.  I'm at work.  I have to go outside if we're fighting.  I can't.  No, no.  We want you to growl for growl.  Growl?  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[03:28:30]  All right, wait.  I heard a growl for growl.  Andre growl for growl.  That was mine.  It was a little corny, but...  No, I think that was Lauren.  Yeah, we need a better growl for growl.  A growl for growl.  Yeah, keep saying it.  Do you really want to growl?  Like a really, really loud growl?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  No, I don't know.  Growl for growl.  I'll tell you what, I'd be screaming my head off if I was at the concert.  Listen. 
[03:29:00]  It's either that or we're going to foo-fuck you, fuckhole.  You might not be screaming your head off.  If you want...  Could you sneeze your cunt off?  How about your...  What?  Yeah, is there any chance that I'm getting tickets?  Are you going to growl for growl or what?  Growl for growl.  Am I getting abused already?  I'm getting abused.  When are you going to realize you didn't win the stupid tickets, you bitch?  How much more obvious can we make it? 
[03:29:30]  Ticket slut.  Make her moan.  Maybe she'll do that.  Prize whore.  Tell her to moan for growl.  She'll probably do that.  Why don't you moan for a dick in your ass, you fat?  Yeah, you were calling up, too.  You were calling, too.  What do you think?  You're in the same boat she's in.  You think you're better?  The SS loser.  What do you think?  We like cock?  Of course we would have gave it to her.  In this case.  We had anything to give away.  Turn your dick inside out and fuck it? 
[03:30:00]  You want to see Dave Grohl?  Turn on fucking MTV and hope for the best.  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah.  That's how we feel about you.  It doesn't suck to us.  I'm going to the show.  Front row, my friend.  That's what us radio people do.  If you end up there, just ask for Animal.  This is what we do to everybody who doesn't get...  Everybody who doesn't get tickets gets this, you fuckfaces.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Front row. 
[03:30:30]  Like we give a shit about our listeners.  Now go away and get back to work.  Tell them Animal sent you.  We got a cushy job to get back to.  Goodbye.  Don't listen to kids, you cunts.  That's why nobody listens to you.  What?  Exactly.  Poor guys were picked in high school.  They need to rent out.  Give me some goddamn tickets.  Not only do you like to be fucking your ass, but you push back and dare them to do it  harder.  You're a queer and you're getting nothing.  So long, faggot. 
[03:31:00]  I'll give you a ticket to a load.  What do you think of them apples?  I'll give you a bleedy dick in your anus.  That's right.  You get three kinds of AIDS at the same time.  That's right.  Useless fucking homosexual.  Jesus, you non-contributing gay man.  That's right.  Lou's giving you the business.  If there was a Lou here.  There's not a Lou.  This is Animal.  Sir? 
[03:31:30]  Sir?  Sir?  Sir?  Miss?  No, she hung up.  Sir?  Are you not done?  No.  No, we're not done.  Did you go now?  Why don't you hang up?  Our phone's broke.  We don't have a hang-up button.  That's right.  We need that.  That's why we've been so mean.  We want people to hang up.  Yeah.  Can you go now, please?  I'm not hanging up.  I want those goddamn tickets.  There's something wrong with our phone.  You called the cum sniffer hotline.  We have no hang-up power.  You guys want hotline?  The only way you're getting a ticket is if you park your car up your mother's cunt, which  is a fucking towway zone because it's so disgusting in there. 
[03:32:00]  You'll get a ticket for not filling the area enough.  When did you realize that you called the party line, sir?  This is too big just for one car.  You've reached the gay men's hotline.  Hi.  If you're into hot gay ass sex, stay on the line.  Hello, Andre?  Please push any key.  Push any key for...  If you are a cocksucker, yeah, push those keys, you dick sucker. 
[03:32:30]  Push one if you like balls in your mouth.  Push two if you like your asshole to be pulled out like a bloody tube sock.  You ain't gonna stop.  Let him push.  Let him push.  I love it.  Zero. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, hello?  Hello.  Chat line, hello.  But there are also many, many other people who just love my dick.  Oh.  Oh.  Just play a little tune.  Musical faggot.  Damn.  You just been poned. 
[03:33:30]  Damn.  You've been foo fisted.  Damn.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  I'd like to make  werewolf movies.  We really are phoning it in.  Yes. 
[03:34:00]  God damn.  This is unlistenable.  I'm the werewolf.  This is awful.  This is just the worst.  What are we doing? This is for our own entertainment.  Here we are shitting on Steve Jobs  for making a bad iPhone.  We're just sitting here bashing  for our own entertainment.  It's the entertainment of one, two, three,  six people or so.  That's about it.  That's it.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  You hung in there a long time.  Yep.  So guess what we're going to do. 
[03:34:30]  I give up.  Guess where you're going, sir.  We're going to call you a faggot.  Right back at you.  And give you a little of this.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Exactly.  That's right.  I'm a police officer.  Hey, what happened?  That doesn't match.  Sir?  Huh?  You don't get tickets,  but you can have the end 
[03:35:00]  of Eddie Van Halen's tongue  in a glad baggie  if you want that.  Listen, listen up.  These are all different.  I know.  I know.  You know, Andres.  We understand.  You're frustrated.  We understand.  I know why that makes you feel better.  I understand.  I'd be doing the same thing  in your position.  Absolutely.  Oh, you like that.  Don't you faggot.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Those men wanted to have sex with me. 
[03:35:30]  If you have a small dick,  push a button.  That's what the thing is.  Small dick, huh?  Yes.  Well,  if you let a gorilla  fuck you in the ass,  it'll make you forget  how small your dick is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've been flying a long time.  You guys do a lot of work.  We do.  This is our jobs.  Yeah, we got to get back to...  Oh, man.  It's a great job.  You get to poke fun of people 
[03:36:00]  you don't even fucking know.  Poke fun?  Poke fun.  How about annihilate verbally?  All I've heard is  faggot and fucking gay jokes.  Your whole life, you mean.  You know,  it's not easy  being a board op here at K-Rock.  So,  please,  relax.  We want to have a little fun  because we make like  eight bucks an hour.  I'm relaxed, buddy.  I'm calling for tickets.  Yeah,  and we're the guys that,  you know,  work the board and stuff,  but, you know,  you gotta...  If it bothers you,  you should hang up  and call the same number again 
[03:36:30]  and complain about  everything we did.  Yeah, we control the tickets.  Because our bosses at K-Rock  will probably fire us.  Yeah, okay.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Listen,  listen,  why don't we just play  a song for you  and make nice here?  Yeah,  what do you want to hear?  What do you want to hear?  You got any Britney Spears?  Ah, see that?  See,  that was stupid.  Yeah,  don't go for the laughter.  I don't want a fucking song.  I want tickets, man.  Yeah,  but we're an alternative rock station.  Why don't you buy them?  How about this?  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Hicksville. 
[03:37:00]  All right,  what's your name?  My name's Andre.  All right,  oh yeah.  So you go,  hi,  this is Andre from Hicksville.  You can say hi  to whoever you want  and then request a song.  A shout out.  Shout out.  All right,  this is Andre.  No,  no,  hold on.  We got to roll tape and stuff  and then we'll play it.  What song you want to hear,  though?  I got to make sure  it's in the library.  Just put it  from Enter the Sandman.  Fuck it.  I haven't heard it  from Metallica.  All right.  Enter the Sandman.  All right.  Just a fucking gay song.  All right,  ready?  Yeah,  well,  hold on. 
[03:37:30]  All right,  hold on.  I just want to-  Hold on.  When I say-  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  I want to run  tape for you here.  All right,  ready?  We're recording  right  now.  How you doing?  My name is Andre  from Hicksville.  I want to give a shout-out  to Amanda and her family.  I was away yesterday.  Cut,  cut,  cut,  cut.  Your phone is crapping out.  Are you on a cell phone?  Yeah.  Yeah,  all right,  let's try that again.  All right,  let's try that again.  All right.  Quiet in the studio.  Here we go. 
[03:38:00]  One,  two,  three,  and we're recording.  All right,  everyone at K-Rock,  stop my dick.  Bye-bye.  Sorry,  I coughed.  Did you cough?  Damn it.  All right,  can we try that again?  Hello?  Sir?  Yeah.  Andre,  Hicksville,  shout-out,  say how great  the radio station is  and then the song.  We'll start playing  over your phone call,  okay?  Here we go.  You're going to get  the song you want  and we're going to  give you a pillbox hat  made out of Amanda's clit. 
[03:38:30]  Nice.  All right,  here we go.  We're recording  in three,  two,  action.  He's gone.  Did he finally get  it?  There he goes.  He finally fucking  had it.  Jesus,  what does he do all day?  We are the most  persistent asshole.  Oh,  is that the worst?  That was like  20 minutes.  Oh,  of just  us being  two fans  bothering one man. 
[03:39:00]  For nothing.  Bothering one.  It was finally  dead Amanda's  pillbox hat.  Yeah,  maybe that did it.  All right,  after that,  we just got to do  line of the day,  I think.  Yeah.  Well,  I got to go get  my phone fixed  because why should  I be able to hear?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  You checked your settings?  I reset them.  You reset them?  Well,  then they should be fine.  Yeah,  they should.  Let's try.  Have we got some lines?  Yes.  All right,  what do we got?  Some lines?  Yeah,  it's about 11.  before you can  listen to it. 
[03:39:30]  Nah.  Why would it work?  Led Zeppelin  set for reunion gig  in London.  Here it is.  What?  Official announcement.  Rock Legends  Led Zeppelin  were set to announce  a one-off  comeback concert  on Wednesday,  nearly three decades  after disbanding.  Yuck.  There it is.  They can do one show  in November in London.  They already did  Live Aid or whatever,  didn't they?  With Jason Bonham.  They already did this.  And it sucked.

John Bonham  is coming back,  but he'll be  a little stiff  and rusty.  Oh.  See?  I get it.  All right.  Here's a runner-up  line of the day.  You rock.  When they're three,  you're like,  so what?  She won't remember this.  You know?  They do.  A puncher in the face.  It doesn't matter.  They're going to  wipe the hard drive  in a minute.  It doesn't matter.

Don't know  what happened.  We'll find out  hopefully tomorrow.  He was abducted  wearing a little backpack.  Somebody.  Someone snatched him up.  Here's another  runner-up line  of the day.

Hell no,  the H2O.  Where's the joke  at? 
[03:44:00]  Hell no,  the H2O.  Hell no,  the H2O.  What is that?  Hello.  You missed a lot  today.  I did,  yeah.  We started a new  bit called  Morning Zoo  Bits of the Day.  Okay.  So then we're just  like,  Oh,  that's somebody's  zoo show?  It's someone's  awful fucking  shit song.  They put it on  their show  thinking,  wow,  this is going  to get people  listening.  Oh,  God.  Hold on.  They produced  that. 
[03:44:30]  Someone spent  some time on  Garage Band  and made that.  Well,  you want to hear  a rock,  wait,  kid rock  them.  You know,  every time I do  one of these zoo  shows,  because I,  you know,  when I work  a club,  I'll have to  call in the  morning before  to all the  radio stations  if I don't  go personally.  And the person  that was right  before I go on  on the phone  always says,  um,  the fellow  you're going  to hear is  his name is,  you know,  whatever,  a cow face.  Um,  uh,  Zach Jack  is the guy  with a deeper  voice.  And then the  woman is Linda 
[03:45:00]  or whatever.  I'm like,  you don't have  to tell me  like,  I need to  fucking know  who the  douchebags  are on the  radio that  I'm talking  to.  Oh,  make sure  that you're  clear.  Okay.  And occasionally  a madman  is going to  chime in.  Madman is  chimes in.  Madman will  chime in.  Oh,  good thing I  know that.  Yeah.  That's their  stunt point.  You don't  really have  to answer  to madman  though.  Do they  think I'm  going to  like try  to sound  folksy by  going,  well,  I'll tell  you what,  madman,  thanks for  the question.  Yeah.  So you're  like,  I'm going to  fucking bother  saying their  name.  And we  wonder why

Berkeley  Performance Center.  It's supposed to  be a good room.  That's a nice  room.  A thousand  seats.  Two thousand  seats.  Nice place,  right?  I don't know.  I've never  been there.  I used to  live around  the corner.  No one  asked you. 
[03:49:30]  That's where  they dumped  off the  nanny.  In the  dumpster.  Close to  there,  right?  Right.  I guess so.  I don't  remember.  Half a  nanny.  I got a  handjob from  a skinny  black woman  in the  doorway of  that  building.  Seriously?  Yeah?  Andy.  It was very  sad because I  was like 22.  I was like a  young guy with  all my hair and  she's jerking me  off.  I kind of  looked up at  my face like,  really?  You need  this?  Like she  even knew.  What are  you doing?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's a  great gig.  You'll have a  good time.  I'm going to  think about that  when I enter 
[03:50:00]  the building.  Okay.  That's where  it was.  It was probably  still some of  my jizz  clinging to the  ground like a  piece of gum.  You go in there,  you're going to  see some of  we get it.  I'm ready to  read more  internet addresses  but I have a  feeling the  authorities will  come if I read  any more of  these.  I'm not taking  a chance.  See, I'm smart.  We'll be in  Philly tomorrow  and Friday,  right?  Yes.  I'm in Orlando  at the Hard Rock  Friday. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  And check out  superdeluxe.com  because me and  Florentine did  some stuff on  there.  All right.  Can we play a  Lynch song?  What song you  want to hear?  Here.  No.  play.  He throws his  hands off.  I don't want  to hear any  of my songs.  I hate my  songs and I'm  tired of them.  You can't be  tired of them.  They're good.  That's exactly  how Zeppelin's  going to feel,  man.  You used to  say you hated  Broadway,  remember?  Still do. 
[03:51:00]  Still do.  What do we  want to hear?  Craig Christ,  we played a  lot, though.  How about  Kill a Kitten?  I played that  one a lot.  I'm trying to  think of one we  haven't played in  a while, that's  all.  Down to the  old pub instead.  With Anthony's  a little solo.  I actually get to  do a little solo  in that one.  I like that.  I'm great about  that.  Yes, we'll end  with Stephen Lynch  today.  All right, you  got it there,  E-Rock?  You sure?  I bet he's not. 
[03:51:30]  No, of course  he's not.  All right, go ahead.  Oh, good work,  E-Rock.  See you tomorrow  in Philly,  man.  Later.  Lad, it's your  duty to find  your lass with  child-bearing hips  in a pink  suplass and  make her your  wife and  love her with  love so true.  Now, some  rivers run high,  some rivers run  low, when her  river runs red,  then she's 
[03:52:00]  starting her flow  and it's called  menstruation.  Here's what it  means to you.  You will notice  her bloomers  are spotty at  first, stand  back, her  ovarian dam's  gonna burst.  Son, don't be  afraid, it's a  natural thing.  Just wad up  some cotton  in hand or  a string and  put the old  linens on top  of the bed.  Get out of  the house and  go down to  the old pub  instead.  Hundreds of  years old.  That's why 
[03:52:30]  bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain  her water,  her breasts  will be tender,  say something  nice and you're  sure to offend  her.  Get out of  the house and  go down to  the old pub  instead.  She'll want  to make love  if you do,  you're a fool,  you'll only end  up with a bloody  old tool.  Now get out  of the house,  go down to  the old pub  instead.  She'll want  you to sample  the fruit of  her loins,  but son,  it'll taste  like some  old rusty  coins.  So turn  off the light 
[03:53:00]  and take  off your hat  and drop  to your knees,  say a prayer  to Saint Pat  that'll give  you the strength  to get out  of the bed  and for Ireland's  sake,  go down  to the old  pub  instead.  I feel a  solo coming  on.  Oh, really?  Perhaps right  here, Anthony.  Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub 
[03:53:30]  is the place  where the  lads are  a-meeting  when the  moon is  full  and the  gals  are a-bleeding  the Catholic,  the Protestant,  even the  pagan,  the pub  is the  place  when your  lady is  ragging.  So drink  of your  pint,  boys,  and thank  your  shamrocks  that as  menfolk  we don't  have to  bleed  from our  c***  and that  we can  escape  from the  lady  in red  and get  out of the  house  and go  down to  the old  pub  instead.  Down to  the old  pub  instead. 
[03:54:00]  Nice.  Thank you,  my lads.  Thank you so  much.  Raise your  glass.  Funny good.  Have a drink.  O.P.  and Anthony. </pre>
